Muʿjam al-Aḥādīth al-Muʿtabara,A Comprehensive Compilation of Reliable Narrations,,Shaykh Muḥammad Āṣif al-Muḥsinī,Ammaar Muslim,"""Muʿjam al-Aḥādīth al-Muʿtabara"" by Shaykh Muḥammad Āṣif Muḥsinī is a monumental work which fills a significant gap in the realm of the works of Ḥadīth. The aim of this comprehensive compilation is to provide people with a dependable resource, countering the long-standing misconception about the perceived insufficiencies in the body of Ḥadīth possessed by the Shīʿa. As such, this project marks a pivotal contribution to the field, providing someone with access to reliable, authentic material. The book showcases Shaykh Muḥsinī’s ambition to assemble a collection of Muʿtabar (reliable) Ḥadīth, thus facilitating the work of jurists, researchers, lecturers, and any layperson interested in gaining knowledge. Despite his busy schedule, Shaykh Muḥsinī committed himself to this colossal task, motivated by a desire to preserve and make accessible the authentic teachings of the Shīʿī faith. In creating this work, Shaykh Muḥsinī was guided by a set of principles. First, the Ḥadīth should have a reliable chain and not contradict the Qurʾān, the established Sunnah, or the intellect. Second, while the book aims to be comprehensive, it may not include every narration with a reliable chain, since the Shaykh had mentioned that he may have accidentally overlooked some narrations. However, it does provide an overwhelming majority of reliable traditions. Shaykh Muḥsinī’s stringent criteria and rigorous application make this work an invaluable resource in Ḥadīth. While some scholars may differ with his judgments, the work aims to provide a universally acceptable core of irreproachable narrations, with the potential to serve as a basis for consensus among scholars and researchers. In summary, ""Muʿjam al-Aḥādīth al-Muʿtabara"" is a milestone in Ḥadīth studies, providing a reliable reference point for those interested in authentic Shia narrations. Its meticulous assembly and rigorous criteria set it apart as a work of significant value and authority.",1 | Book of Intellect and Knowledge,Chapter 1 | Submission of Intellect and its Excellence,Ḥadīth #1,[1/1] اصول الكافي: عن عدة من أصحابنا منهم محمد بن يحيى العطار، عن أحمد بن محمد، عن الحسن بن محبوب، عن العلاء بن رزين، عن محمد بن مسلم، عن أبي جعفر عليه السلام قال: لما خلق الله العقل استنطقه ثم قال له: أقبل فأقبل ثم قال له: أدبر فأدبر ثم قال: وعزتي وجلالي ما خلقت خلقا هو أحب إلي منك ولا أكملتك إلا فيمن احب، أما إني إياك آمر، وإياك أنهى وإياك اعاقب، وإياك اثيب,"1.

As such, this project marks a pivotal contribution to the field, providing someone with access to reliable, authentic material. The book showcases Shaykh Muḥsinī’s ambition to assemble a collection of Muʿtabar (reliable) Ḥadīth, thus facilitating the work of jurists, researchers, lecturers, and any layperson interested in gaining knowledge. Despite his busy schedule, Shaykh Muḥsinī committed himself to this colossal task, motivated by a desire to preserve and make accessible the authentic teachings of the Shīʿī faith. In creating this work, Shaykh Muḥsinī was guided by a set of principles. First, the Ḥadīth should have a reliable chain and not contradict the Qurʾān, the established Sunnah, or the intellect. Second, while the book aims to be comprehensive, it may not include every narration with a reliable chain, since the Shaykh had mentioned that he may have accidentally overlooked some narrations. However, it does provide an overwhelming majority of reliable traditions. Shaykh Muḥsinī’s stringent criteria and rigorous application make this work an invaluable resource in Ḥadīth.

The aim of this comprehensive compilation is to provide people with a dependable resource, countering the long-standing misconception about the perceived insufficiencies in the body of Ḥadīth possessed by the Shīʿa. As such, this project marks a pivotal contribution to the field, providing someone with access to reliable, authentic material. The book showcases Shaykh Muḥsinī’s ambition to assemble a collection of Muʿtabar (reliable) Ḥadīth, thus facilitating the work of jurists, researchers, lecturers, and any layperson interested in gaining knowledge. Despite his busy schedule, Shaykh Muḥsinī committed himself to this colossal task, motivated by a desire to preserve and make accessible the authentic teachings of the Shīʿī faith. In creating this work, Shaykh Muḥsinī was guided by a set of principles. First, the Ḥadīth should have a reliable chain and not contradict the Qurʾān, the established Sunnah, or the intellect. Second, while the book aims to be comprehensive, it may not include every narration with a reliable chain, since the Shaykh had mentioned that he may have accidentally overlooked some narrations. However, it does provide an overwhelming majority of reliable traditions. Shaykh Muḥsinī’s stringent criteria and rigorous application make this work an invaluable resource in Ḥadīth. While some scholars may differ with his judgments, the work aims to provide a universally acceptable core of irreproachable narrations, with the potential to serve as a basis for consensus among scholars and researchers. In summary, ""Muʿjam al-Aḥādīth al-Muʿtabara"" is a milestone in Ḥadīth studies, providing a reliable reference point for those interested in authentic Shia narrations.

The aim of this comprehensive compilation is to provide people with a dependable resource, countering the long-standing misconception about the perceived insufficiencies in the body of Ḥadīth possessed by the Shīʿa. As such, this project marks a pivotal contribution to the field, providing someone with access to reliable, authentic material. The book showcases Shaykh Muḥsinī’s ambition to assemble a collection of Muʿtabar (reliable) Ḥadīth, thus facilitating the work of jurists, researchers, lecturers, and any layperson interested in gaining knowledge. Despite his busy schedule, Shaykh Muḥsinī committed himself to this colossal task, motivated by a desire to preserve and make accessible the authentic teachings of the Shīʿī faith. In creating this work, Shaykh Muḥsinī was guided by a set of principles. First, the Ḥadīth should have a reliable chain and not contradict the Qurʾān, the established Sunnah, or the intellect. Second, while the book aims to be comprehensive, it may not include every narration with a reliable chain, since the Shaykh had mentioned that he may have accidentally overlooked some narrations. However, it does provide an overwhelming majority of reliable traditions. Shaykh Muḥsinī’s stringent criteria and rigorous application make this work an invaluable resource in Ḥadīth.

He said: you will only break the prayer and repeat it anew if you had doubt about where exactly it was (the location of it – having not found it before) and go on to find it (while praying), but if you had no doubt [of having contracted impurity at all] and then see it (the impurity) – still wet – you cut off your prayer and wash it, then you continue with the same prayer [where you left off], because you just don’t know perhaps it is something that fell on you [while praying], for it is not appropriate for you to override certainty by doubt."

[1/139] Rijal al-Kashshi: Hamduwayh and Ibrahim from Abu Ja’far Muhammad b. Isa al-Ubaydi who said: I heard Hisham b. Ibrahim al-Khatli – and he is al-Mashraqi – say: I sought permission for a number of people to enter upon Abi al-Hasan عليه السلام in the year one hundred and ninety nine, so they attended and we attended, a total of sixteen men, waiting at the door of Abi al-Hasan the Second عليه السلام. Then Musafir (a Mawla of al-Ridha) came out and said: The family of Yaqtin and Yunus b. Abd al-Rahman should wait while the rest should enter one by one, so when they had all entered and exited, Musafir came out and called me, Musa [b. Salih], Ja`far b. Isa and Yunus, and allowed us to enter to meet him, and al-Abbas (another Mawla of al-Ridha) was stood in a corner without footwear and without having worn a cloak, and that was in the year of Abu al-Saraya (i.e. his coming out in revolt). He (al-Ridha) saluted us and ordered us to sit, so when we had sat – Ja`far b. Isa said to him: O my master – we complain to Allah and to you in regards what we are in from our companions [the treatment which we receive from them]. He said: and what are you in from them? Ja`far said: they – by Allah – denounce us as heretics, deem us disbelievers, and disassociate from us, so he (i.e. the Imam) said: like this were the companions of Ali b. al-Husayn, Muhammad b. Ali, Ja`far and Musa عليهم السلام, for the companions of Zurara used to consider as disbelievers all the others (apart from themselves), and likewise, the others used to consider them as disbelievers. I said to him: O my master – we seek assistance in you from these two old men, Yunus and Hisham, and they are both present, for they are the ones who have trained us and taught us theological disputation, so if we are – O my master – upon guidance, then we have succeeded, and if we are upon misguidance, then these two are the ones who have misguided us, so order us to leave it (i.e. Kalam) and turn to Allah in repentance from it, O my master – call us to the religion of Allah, for we will follow you, so he عليه السلام said: I do not know you except as being upon guidance, may Allah recompense you goodly for the former companionship and for the recent one. [They interpreted the former companionship to mean Ali b. Yaqtin, and the recent one to be our service to him, and Allah knows better]. Then Ja`far said: may I be made your ransom, Salih and Aba al-Asad the son-in-law of Ali b. Yaqtin relate from you that they quoted to you some of our theological arguments – so you said to them both: what is with you and theological disputations [what do you have to do with it?] – it is dragging you to heresy! so he عليه السلام said: I did not say that to them! did I say that?! – by Allah – I did not say that to them! Yunus said: may I be made your ransom – they assert that we are heretics, and he was sat beside a man, and he had placed one leg over the other (was seated cross legged), and time after time (every now and then) was rolling his face and his two cheeks upon the interior of his left foot, so he (al-Ridha) said to him: assume that you were indeed a heretic and they say about you – he is a believer – what would that benefit you? and if you were a believer and they said: he is a heretic – what would that harm you? al-Mashriqi said to him: by Allah – you do not speak except that which was also spoken by your forefathers. We do have a book, we have called it the ‘comprehensive book’ (Kitab al-Jami), in it is all that which the people have spoken about [what they have talked about in regards theology] on the authority of your forefathers [with the decisive judgment from the `Aimma about it all], and we debate based on it, and Ja`far said to him something similar to this, so he turned to Ja`far and said: if you were not speaking by [in accordance with] the words of my forefathers then with the words of Abi Bakr and Umar do you want to speak!?"

As such, this project marks a pivotal contribution to the field, providing someone with access to reliable, authentic material. The book showcases Shaykh Muḥsinī’s ambition to assemble a collection of Muʿtabar (reliable) Ḥadīth, thus facilitating the work of jurists, researchers, lecturers, and any layperson interested in gaining knowledge. Despite his busy schedule, Shaykh Muḥsinī committed himself to this colossal task, motivated by a desire to preserve and make accessible the authentic teachings of the Shīʿī faith. In creating this work, Shaykh Muḥsinī was guided by a set of principles. First, the Ḥadīth should have a reliable chain and not contradict the Qurʾān, the established Sunnah, or the intellect.

However, it does provide an overwhelming majority of reliable traditions. Shaykh Muḥsinī’s stringent criteria and rigorous application make this work an invaluable resource in Ḥadīth.

The aim of this comprehensive compilation is to provide people with a dependable resource, countering the long-standing misconception about the perceived insufficiencies in the body of Ḥadīth possessed by the Shīʿa. As such, this project marks a pivotal contribution to the field, providing someone with access to reliable, authentic material. The book showcases Shaykh Muḥsinī’s ambition to assemble a collection of Muʿtabar (reliable) Ḥadīth, thus facilitating the work of jurists, researchers, lecturers, and any layperson interested in gaining knowledge. Despite his busy schedule, Shaykh Muḥsinī committed himself to this colossal task, motivated by a desire to preserve and make accessible the authentic teachings of the Shīʿī faith. In creating this work, Shaykh Muḥsinī was guided by a set of principles. First, the Ḥadīth should have a reliable chain and not contradict the Qurʾān, the established Sunnah, or the intellect. Second, while the book aims to be comprehensive, it may not include every narration with a reliable chain, since the Shaykh had mentioned that he may have accidentally overlooked some narrations. However, it does provide an overwhelming majority of reliable traditions. Shaykh Muḥsinī’s stringent criteria and rigorous application make this work an invaluable resource in Ḥadīth. While some scholars may differ with his judgments, the work aims to provide a universally acceptable core of irreproachable narrations, with the potential to serve as a basis for consensus among scholars and researchers.

The aim of this comprehensive compilation is to provide people with a dependable resource, countering the long-standing misconception about the perceived insufficiencies in the body of Ḥadīth possessed by the Shīʿa. As such, this project marks a pivotal contribution to the field, providing someone with access to reliable, authentic material. The book showcases Shaykh Muḥsinī’s ambition to assemble a collection of Muʿtabar (reliable) Ḥadīth, thus facilitating the work of jurists, researchers, lecturers, and any layperson interested in gaining knowledge. Despite his busy schedule, Shaykh Muḥsinī committed himself to this colossal task, motivated by a desire to preserve and make accessible the authentic teachings of the Shīʿī faith. In creating this work, Shaykh Muḥsinī was guided by a set of principles. First, the Ḥadīth should have a reliable chain and not contradict the Qurʾān, the established Sunnah, or the intellect. Second, while the book aims to be comprehensive, it may not include every narration with a reliable chain, since the Shaykh had mentioned that he may have accidentally overlooked some narrations. However, it does provide an overwhelming majority of reliable traditions. Shaykh Muḥsinī’s stringent criteria and rigorous application make this work an invaluable resource in Ḥadīth. While some scholars may differ with his judgments, the work aims to provide a universally acceptable core of irreproachable narrations, with the potential to serve as a basis for consensus among scholars and researchers. In summary, ""Muʿjam al-Aḥādīth al-Muʿtabara"" is a milestone in Ḥadīth studies, providing a reliable reference point for those interested in authentic Shia narrations.

Others believe in pre-destination which we similarly disassociate from as it is not of the religion of your forefathers. He said: what then do you say? I said: we affirm the view of Abi Abdillah عليه السلام when he was asked about the words of Allah Mighty and Majestic “and pilgrimage to the House is a duty owed by Allah to the people – for whoever has the capacity to find a way to it” (3:97) – what is his ‘capacity’? so Abu Abdillah عليه السلام said: good-health and having wealth, so we subscribe to the verdict of Abi Abdillah عليه السلام, he said: Abu Abdillah عليه السلام spoke the truth, this is how it is."

Mahbub from Muhammad b. Abdallah b. Zurara and his [Zurara’s] two sons al-Hasan and al-Husayn from Abdallah b. Zurara who said: Abu Abdillah عليه السلام said to me: convey my salutations of peace to your father and say to him: Verily, I only defame you as a way of defending you, for the masses and the enemy hasten to whomever we draw near and praise his station so as to cause harm to the one we love and bring close. They accuse such a one because of our love for him and his closeness and intimacy with us, and they consider causing him harm and even killing him as justified. On the other hand, they praise every one whom we fault even if his affair is not praiseworthy. Thus, I fault you because you have become notorious as a result of your association with us and your inclination towards us, which have caused you to become blamable in the eyes of the people and your works to be looked upon unfavourably, all this because of your love for us and your inclination towards us. So I wished to fault you so that they can praise your religious stand as a result of my denigrating and diminishing you, and this becomes a way of warding off their evil from you. Allah Majestic and Mighty says: “as for the boat then it belonged to the poor working at sea so I wished to damage it because there was a king after them who seizes every good boat by force” this is a revelation from Allah [including the word] ‘good’. No by Allah! he did not damage it except so that it be saved from the king and is not ruined in his hands. It was a ‘good’ boat which had no question of being defective Allah be praised, so comprehend the parable, may Allah have mercy on you! for you are by Allah! the most beloved of people to me and the most beloved of the companions of my father in my estimation both in life and after death. Indeed you are the best boat in that tumultuous and stormy sea, and there is a tyrannical and usurping king after you, keeping watch for the crossing of every good boat returning from the sea of guidance so that he can take it for himself and seize it and its owners, so may the mercy of Allah be upon you in life and His mercy and pleasure be upon you after death. And your two sons al-Hasan and al-Husayn brought me your letter, may Allah guard, defend, watch over and protect them because of the goodness of their father, the way He had protected the two boys (the orphans in Surat al-Kahf). Let not your heart constrict in grief if Abu Basir comes to you with the opposite of that which you were instructed by my father and by me, for by Allah! we did not instruct you and him except with an instruction that is fitting to act upon both for us and for you, and for each [instruction, even if seemingly contradictory] we have diverse expressions and interpretations which all agree with the truth. And if we were allowed [to explain] you would come to know that the truth is in that which we have instructed you. So refer back to us the matter and submit to us and be patient in acting according to our rulings and be satisfied with them. The one who has divided you is your shepherd who has been given authority by Allah over His creation. He [the shepherd] is more aware of what is in the interest of his flock and what can corrupt it. If he wishes he divides between them to safe-guard them, then he unites them once more so that it is secure from destruction and the fear posed by its enemy, in such a time as Allah permits, bringing it thereby safety from His place of safety and relief from Him. Upon you is to submit and to refer back to us and to await our affair and your affair and our relief and your relief. However [if you do not submit wholly then], if our Riser were to rise and our Speaker speak and he recommences teaching you the Qur’an, the Laws of religion, the rulings and inheritance shares the way Allah revealed them to Muhammad the ‘people of insight’ among you will repudiate it on that day a bitter repudiation, then you will not remain steadfast upon the religion of Allah and his path except under the threat of the sword over your necks! The people after the prophet of Allah were left to embark by Allah the same example as those who came before you, so they changed, altered, distorted, and added to the religion of Allah and reduced from it, consequently there is not a thing which the people are upon today [following] except that it is distorted when compared to that which was revealed from Allah. Respond then my Allah have mercy on you away from what you are calling for to what you are being called to, until comes the one who will renew the religion anew. Upon you is the forty six unit prayer and to make the Hajj by reciting the Talbiyya aloud for Ifrad [Hajj alone without Umra] and make an intention to dissolve it [later], when you reach Makka you make the Tawaf and the Sa’i [between Safa and Marwa], then you dissolve what you had made Talbiyya for and change the Hajj to Umra, you are consequently relieved of the state of Ihram up to the day of Tarwiya, then you renew reciting the Talbiyya aloud for Hajj solely [Ifrad] [and go] to Mina, and witness the benefits at Arafat and Muzdalifa, for this was how the messenger of Allah صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم made the Hajj and this is what he had ordered his companions to do, to dissolve that which they had recited the Talbiyya aloud for and to change the [intention of] Hajj to [that of] Umra, and the messenger of Allah صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم remained in [the state of] his Ihram because of the animal which he had driven with [accompanying] him, for the Sa`iq [one who drives the animal] is a Qarin [coupler] and the Qarin does not disengage [from the state of Ihram] until his Hadi [sacrificial animal] reaches its appropriate place, and its appropriate place is the sacrificial grounds in Mina, so when it reaches there [and is slaughtered] then he has disengaged [from the sate of Ihram]. This which we have ordered you to comply with is the Hajj of the Mutamati`, so adhere to it and your chest should not be constricted [in grief], that which Abu Basir came to you with in regards the prayer being fifty one [units], and voicing the Talbiyya aloud for Tamattu [enjoying] combining the Umra with the Hajj [at the outset, without the maneuver of having to dissolve the intention] and our instruction to him to recite the Talbiyya for Tamattu, then we have for that different interpretations and expressions which are accommodating for both us and you, and none of them [the seemingly different instructions] oppose the truth nor contradict it, and all praise is due to Allah."

As such, this project marks a pivotal contribution to the field, providing someone with access to reliable, authentic material.

Despite his busy schedule, Shaykh Muḥsinī committed himself to this colossal task, motivated by a desire to preserve and make accessible the authentic teachings of the Shīʿī faith. In creating this work, Shaykh Muḥsinī was guided by a set of principles. First, the Ḥadīth should have a reliable chain and not contradict the Qurʾān, the established Sunnah, or the intellect.

[1/174] al-Kafi: Ali b. Ibrahim from his father from Safwan b. Yahya from Iys b. al-Qasim who said: I heard Aba Abdillah عليه السلام saying: upon you is to fear God alone who Has no partner, and to be on the lookout for yourselves, for by Allah a man may possess a flock over which he places a shepherd, but when he discovers another man who is more knowledgeable about caring for his flock than the one in place he removes the latter and replaces him with that man who is more knowledgeable about his flock than the one who was previously taking care of it. If one of you had two souls, one of which he could fight with and risk it, while the other remains alive safe to use to act upon the truth that has become clear to him [then it would have been fine], but he has only one soul – if it is lost then by Allah the opportunity for repentance is also lost. You are best placed to make decisions for yourselves, if a comer comes to you from us [the people of the House] then scrutinize what things are you coming out in revolt over exactly, and do not say ‘Zayd revolted’ [to justify yourselves] for Zayd was a scholar and truthful, moreover he did not call you for his own sake rather he called you to rally around the Rida [pleasing choice] from the family of Muhammad [i.e. the Imam], and had he become victorious he would have followed through on what he had called you to. But the one who revolts from among us today to what thing is he calling you to? is it to the pleasing choice from the family of Muhammad?! if so then we declare that we are not pleased with him! and if he is disobeying us about this today when he has no following then how much more emboldened will he be to ignore and not listen to us when the banners and the flags [converge around him]! [You are not come out] except with the one around whom the children of Fatima are united over, for by Allah your man is none other than the one around whom they unite. So when it is Rajab then proceed in the name of Allah Mighty and Majestic [to Makka] but if you wish to delay to Sha`ban then there is no harm done and if you prefer to fast in your families then perhaps that is more appropriate for you. Indeed the Sufyani is enough of a sign for you [to indicate the closeness of the appearance]."

[2/-] al-Kafi: A number of our companions from Ahmad b. Muhammad b. Isa from Ali b. al-Hakam from Aban who said: al-Ahwal reported to me saying: Zayd b. Ali b. al-Husayn عليهما السلام sent for me while he was in hiding so I went to see him. He [Zayd] said to me: O Aba Ja`far [al-Ahwal] what will you say if a knocker from among us [the family of the prophet] knocks on your door [asking for your support to fight the unjust ruler] – would you come out in revolt with him? I said to him: if it is your father [al-Sajjad] or your brother [al-Baqir] I would set out with him. He [Zayd] said to me: Verily I wish to rise up and fight these people so set out with me, I said: No, I will not do so may I be made your ransom, he said to me: do you prefer your life over mine? I said: it is only one soul [that I have] – if Allah does indeed have a Hujja [proof] on the earth [whose existence you deny] then the one who stays back from joining you is saved and the one who joins you is destroyed [for revolting without the permission of the Hujja], but if Allah does not have a Hujja [proof] on the earth [as you claim] then the one who stays back and the one who joins you are both the same. He said to me: O Aba Ja`far I used to sit with my father to share a plate with him so he would feed me the choicest piece of meat and cool for me a hot morsel fearing for my health but he did not fear for me enough to save me from the hell-fire! How could it be that he informed you the truth about the religion [the presence of the Hujja] and did not inform me about it! I said to him: may I be made your ransom – it is only because of his fear of hell-fire for you you that he did not inform you! he feared for you that you would reject it and enter the fire, but he informed me [not caring either way] so if I accept I am saved and he was not bothered that I enter the fire [if I reject]. Then I said to him: may I be made your ransom are you better or the prophets? He said: the prophets, I said: Ya`qub said to Yusuf: “O my son – do not relate your dream to your brothers for they will devise a plot against you” (12:5) why not inform them and expect them not to devise a plot against him but rather he was to keep it a secret from them [so as not to tempt them]? the same way your father kept it a secret from you because he feared for you.

The aim of this comprehensive compilation is to provide people with a dependable resource, countering the long-standing misconception about the perceived insufficiencies in the body of Ḥadīth possessed by the Shīʿa. As such, this project marks a pivotal contribution to the field, providing someone with access to reliable, authentic material. The book showcases Shaykh Muḥsinī’s ambition to assemble a collection of Muʿtabar (reliable) Ḥadīth, thus facilitating the work of jurists, researchers, lecturers, and any layperson interested in gaining knowledge. Despite his busy schedule, Shaykh Muḥsinī committed himself to this colossal task, motivated by a desire to preserve and make accessible the authentic teachings of the Shīʿī faith. In creating this work, Shaykh Muḥsinī was guided by a set of principles. First, the Ḥadīth should have a reliable chain and not contradict the Qurʾān, the established Sunnah, or the intellect. Second, while the book aims to be comprehensive, it may not include every narration with a reliable chain, since the Shaykh had mentioned that he may have accidentally overlooked some narrations. However, it does provide an overwhelming majority of reliable traditions. Shaykh Muḥsinī’s stringent criteria and rigorous application make this work an invaluable resource in Ḥadīth. While some scholars may differ with his judgments, the work aims to provide a universally acceptable core of irreproachable narrations, with the potential to serve as a basis for consensus among scholars and researchers. In summary, ""Muʿjam al-Aḥādīth al-Muʿtabara"" is a milestone in Ḥadīth studies, providing a reliable reference point for those interested in authentic Shia narrations.

I said: may I be made your ransom – what thing is that? he said: you renting out your camels to this man – meaning Harun [al-Rashid, the Abbasid caliph]. I said: by Allah I did not rent them out to him cheerfully or arrogantly, nor did I rent them out for him to hunt with or amuse himself through them, rather I rent them out to him for the road to Makka [i.e. for Hajj], and I do not attend to him personally, rather I send to him with my servants. He said to me: O Safwan does the payment of your rent accrue on them? I said: yes, may I be made your ransom, he said: do you wish for their survival until they pay you your rent? I said: yes, he said: so whoever desires their survival then he is one of them, and whoever is with them his abode is the hell-fire. Safwan said: so I went and sold all my camels, every last one of them. Harun was informed of this, he called me and said to me: O Safwan I hear that you have sold all your camels? I said: yes, he said: what is the reason? I said: I am an old man and the servants are not up to the job, he said: how far! how far! I do know the one who directed you to do this – it is Musa b. Ja`far who directed you to do this! I said: what do I have to do with Musa b.

Behold! I will proceed you but you will catch up with me at the reservoir – my Lake-fount – tomorrow. It is a Lake-fount whose breadth is like the distance between Busra and San`a. In it are goblets made of silver like the number of stars in the sky. Behold!

As for the smaller weighty thing it is the ally of the Qur`an, and that is Ali b. Abi Talib and his descendants عليهم السلام – the two will not separate until they return to me at the Lake-fount.

Muhammad said: I relayed this to Abi Ja`far عليه السلام and said: may I be made your ransom – a man from among our companions dies without willing to anyone and has left behind slave-women, it happens that the judge appoints a man from among us to over-see their sale but his heart has misgivings because they are Furuj – what is your ruling about that? he said: if the supervisor is someone like you or Abd al-Hamid then there is no problem."

As such, this project marks a pivotal contribution to the field, providing someone with access to reliable, authentic material.

Despite his busy schedule, Shaykh Muḥsinī committed himself to this colossal task, motivated by a desire to preserve and make accessible the authentic teachings of the Shīʿī faith. In creating this work, Shaykh Muḥsinī was guided by a set of principles. First, the Ḥadīth should have a reliable chain and not contradict the Qurʾān, the established Sunnah, or the intellect.

Haska and another called al-Qasim al-Yaqtini. Among their beliefs is that they say the words of Allah the Elevated: “verily Salat safeguards from indecency and wrong-doing” (29:45) refers to a man [Salat is embodied in a man], not to prostration nor to bowing. Similarly, Zakat refers to that man, not to a set number of gold coins nor to the giving out of wealth. They have done likewise in regards injunctions concerning the obligatory, the recommended and the forbidden – they have interpreted and transformed it in a way akin to that which I have mentioned. So if you deem it proper to clarify for us and to favour your followers by that in which lies their safety and salvation from these beliefs which can lead them to perdition [then do so]. So he عليه السلام wrote: this is not our religion therefore disassociate from it."

As such, this project marks a pivotal contribution to the field, providing someone with access to reliable, authentic material.

Despite his busy schedule, Shaykh Muḥsinī committed himself to this colossal task, motivated by a desire to preserve and make accessible the authentic teachings of the Shīʿī faith. In creating this work, Shaykh Muḥsinī was guided by a set of principles. First, the Ḥadīth should have a reliable chain and not contradict the Qurʾān, the established Sunnah, or the intellect. Second, while the book aims to be comprehensive, it may not include every narration with a reliable chain, since the Shaykh had mentioned that he may have accidentally overlooked some narrations. However, it does provide an overwhelming majority of reliable traditions. Shaykh Muḥsinī’s stringent criteria and rigorous application make this work an invaluable resource in Ḥadīth.

Shurayh said: this is one witness, and I do not rule based on a sole witness unless there is another one with him [to corroborate]. Then he [Ali] brought Qanbar and he too testified that it was the armour of Talha taken treacherously in the battle of Basra. He [Shurayh] said: this one is a slave, and I do not rule based on the testimony of a slave. Thereupon Ali became angry and said: take away the armour [from Abdallah b. Kufl] for this one [Shurayh] has transgressed in his ruling three times! Shurayh abandoned his judgment seat and said: I will not judge between two – ever – unless you inform me how I have transgressed thrice in my rulings? Ali said to him: when I said: ‘this is the armour of Talha which was taken by treachery in the battle of Basra’ you said: ‘produce evidence for what you say’ while the Messenger of Allah صلى الله عليه واله had said: “wherever a usurped booty is found it is taken without any evidence [required]”, I [Ali] said [to myself]: the man has not heard the Hadith [is unaware of it]. Then I brought al-Hasan who testified so you said: ‘this is one witness, and I do not rule based on a sole witness unless there is another one with him [to corroborate]’ while the Messenger of Allah صلى الله عليه واله used to give judgment based on [the evidence of] a single witness and an oath [if the witness backs up what he says by swearing an oath]. Finally, I brought Qanbar who testified so you said: ‘this one is a slave’ but there is no problem with the testimony of a slave if he is Adil [possessing moral probity]. This then was the third [transgression you made]. Then he عليه السلام said: O Shurayh the Imam of the Muslims is entrusted to oversee their affairs in regards things which are much greater than this! Abu Ja’far عليه السلام said: The first to reject the testimony of slaves was RUMA."
Muʿjam al-Aḥādīth al-Muʿtabara,A Comprehensive Compilation of Reliable Narrations,,Shaykh Muḥammad Āṣif al-Muḥsinī,Ammaar Muslim,"""Muʿjam al-Aḥādīth al-Muʿtabara"" by Shaykh Muḥammad Āṣif Muḥsinī is a monumental work which fills a significant gap in the realm of the works of Ḥadīth. The aim of this comprehensive compilation is to provide people with a dependable resource, countering the long-standing misconception about the perceived insufficiencies in the body of Ḥadīth possessed by the Shīʿa. As such, this project marks a pivotal contribution to the field, providing someone with access to reliable, authentic material. The book showcases Shaykh Muḥsinī’s ambition to assemble a collection of Muʿtabar (reliable) Ḥadīth, thus facilitating the work of jurists, researchers, lecturers, and any layperson interested in gaining knowledge. Despite his busy schedule, Shaykh Muḥsinī committed himself to this colossal task, motivated by a desire to preserve and make accessible the authentic teachings of the Shīʿī faith. In creating this work, Shaykh Muḥsinī was guided by a set of principles. First, the Ḥadīth should have a reliable chain and not contradict the Qurʾān, the established Sunnah, or the intellect. Second, while the book aims to be comprehensive, it may not include every narration with a reliable chain, since the Shaykh had mentioned that he may have accidentally overlooked some narrations. However, it does provide an overwhelming majority of reliable traditions. Shaykh Muḥsinī’s stringent criteria and rigorous application make this work an invaluable resource in Ḥadīth. While some scholars may differ with his judgments, the work aims to provide a universally acceptable core of irreproachable narrations, with the potential to serve as a basis for consensus among scholars and researchers. In summary, ""Muʿjam al-Aḥādīth al-Muʿtabara"" is a milestone in Ḥadīth studies, providing a reliable reference point for those interested in authentic Shia narrations.

I [the Imam] was returning one day from al-Fur` [a place between Makka and Madina] when the time of prayer entered. I dismounted and proceeded near a Thumama [panic grass] shrub. When I completed a single unit a snake came near me, but I continued with my prayer and did not shorten it in any way nor did I allow any deficiencies to come into it. It came near me then returned to the shrub. Only when I had completed my prayer and followed it up by my normal supplication did I call the one who was with me and said: Keep away from the snake under the shrub. Whoever fears none except Allah then He suffices for him."

Abu Abdillah عليه السلام said [to me]: Would you like to hear her speech? I said: Yes, may I be made your ransom. He said: Then draw near, and he made me sit upon the rug [which he was seated on]. She entered and spoke and I found her to be a very eloquent woman. She asked him about so and so [Abu Bakr and Umar], so he said to her: Deem them to be your leaders, she said: Do you allow me to say to my Lord when I meet him that you ordered me to take them as my authorities? He said: Yes. She said: [I ask this] because this one who is with you on the rug [i.e. Abu Basir] orders me to disassociate from them while Kathir al-Nawwa orders me to take them as authorities, so which one is more beloved to you? He [the Imam] said: This one [i.e. Abu Basir] and his companions are by Allah more beloved to me than Kathir al-Nawwa and his fellows. This one [i.e. Abu Basir] argues by saying: “whoever does not judge by what Allah has revealed – then it is those who are the disbelievers” (5:44), “and whoever does not judge by what Allah has revealed – then it is those who are the wrongdoers” (5:45), “and whoever does not judge by what Allah has revealed – then it is those who are the defiantly disobedient” (5:47).

Abd al-Rahman from Ibn Muskan from Isa Shalqan who said: I said to Abi al-Hasan [al-Kadhim] عليه السلام when he was still a boy before he reached puberty: May I be made your ransom, what is this we hear from you father, first he ordered us to associate with Abi al-Khattab then he ordered us to disassociate from him? So Abu al-Hasan عليه السلام said of his own volition: Allah created the prophets on prophethood, so they do not become except prophets. He created the believers on belief, so they do not become except believers. But he deposited belief in a group, so if He wishes He completes it for them, and if He wishes He takes it away from them. Abu al-Khattab was one of those whose faith was loaned out to him by Allah, so when he lied about my father – Allah took away that faith from him. He [Isa] said: I repeated these words to Abi Abdillah عليه السلام so he said: If you had asked us about that [the same question] we would not have anything different to say to you."

[1/-] al-Kafi: Ali b. Ibrahim from Muhammad b. Isa from Musa b. al-Qasim al-Bajali from Ali b. Ja’far who said: Muhammad b. Ismail [b. Ja’far] approached me when we were in Makka and had just completed the Umra in the month of Rajab – he said: O uncle, I want to travel to Baghdad but first I wish to bid farewell to my uncle Aba al-Hasan – that is Musa b. Ja’far. I would like it if you accompany me to meet him. I came out with him heading towards my brother who was in his house in Huba. We reached a little after Maghrib. I knocked the door and was answered by my brother who said: who is that? I said: Ali, he said: I am just coming – he was someone who took long in making the ablution – so I said: make haste, he said: I will. Eventually he came out wearing a lower garment [waist-wrapper] dyed in an earthish hue, knotted at his neck and proceeded to sit at the threshold [step] of the door. Ali b. Ja’far said: I bent towards him, kissed his forehead and said: I have come to you concerning a matter, if you find it to be appropriate then it is Allah who facilitated it, and if it is not [if you find it disagreeable] then how often do we err [as humans]. He said: what is it? I said: this is the son of your brother, he wishes to bid you farewell and depart towards Baghdad. He [the Imam] said to me: call him [Muhammad b. Ismail]. I called him and he was close by. He [Muhammad b. Ismail] came near him, kissed his forehead and said: May I be made your ransom, advise me, he [the Imam] said: I advise you to fear Allah concerning my blood, he replied to him: May Allah do such to whoever wishes ill for you, and he began supplicating against the one who harbors ill-feeling towards him. Then he kissed his forehead a second time and said: O uncle, advise me, he said: I advise you to fear Allah concerning my blood, he said: May Allah do such and such to whoever wishes ill for you [and He has already done so]. Then he kissed his forehead a third time and said: O uncle, advise me, he said: I advise you to fear Allah concerning my blood, so he supplicated against the one who wishes ill towards him, then he turned away from him [to depart], I too began walking away with him, but my brother said to me: O Ali, [stop] where you are. I halted, he called me and I entered [the house]. He outstretched a pouch which contained a hundred gold coins and handed it to me and said: tell the son of your brother [nephew] to make use of it on his journey. Ali said: I took it and twisted it around the hem of my cloak, then he handed me another hundred and said: give it to him, then he handed me another pouch and said: give it to him also. I said: may I be made your ransom, if you fear him doing what you described then why are you aiding him against yourself [by helping him]? he said: If I maintain my ties with him and he cuts me off then Allah will cut off his life-time. Then he took to hand a tanned leather pillow [hollowed out to store money] in which were three thousand fine silver coins and said: give this to him as well. He [Ali b. Ja’far] said: I came out and gave him the first hundred whereupon he became extremely delighted and supplicated for his uncle, then I gave him the second and the third. He became so happy that I thought he will turn back and not depart [for Baghdad]. Lastly I gave him the three thousand silver coins. Nevertheless, he departed on his mission until he went in to see Harun [the Abbasid Caliph] and greeted him by acknowledging his Caliphate [said: peace be upon you O Commander of the Faithful]. Then he said: I never thought that there could be two Caliphs on earth [at the same time] until I saw my uncle Musa b. Ja’far being greeted with the Caliphate [people referring to him as the Caliph when greeting him]. Harun sent him one hundred thousand silver coins [as a reward for his reporting about his uncle] but Allah afflicted him [Muhammad b. Ismail] with an ailment [in which an ulcer grows and chokes the passage in the throat] and he did not get the chance to even take a look at a single silver coin [that he had been gifted] let alone touch it."

Abu Ali proceeded to dictate it to me and informed me that Aba al-Qasim had retracted his original decision not to publicize it, for even though he was in the hands of the group and under arrest but he was ordered [by the Twelfth Imam] to publicize it, and that he should not fear but feel secure, consequently he was freed and was released from detention a short while after that and all praise belongs to Allah. The text of the Tawqi (of the Twelfth Imam): (O Abu Ali b. Hammam) may He (Allah) lengthen your stay, make you know good in its totality and end by it (good) your works [al-Saymari: may He make you know good] – Inform the one whose religion you trust and whose intention you are confident of among our brothers – may Allah make you (pl.) successful [Ibn Dawud: may Allah perpetuate your (pl.) successes] that Muhammad b. Ali famously known as al-Shalmaghani [Ibn Dawud added: and he is one of those to whom Allah has hastened the wrath and has not given any respite] has apostasized from Islam and left it. He has introduced heresy in the religion of Allah and has disbelieved in the Creator Mighty and Elevated because of what he has claimed [Harun: in what he has claimed]. He has foisted a lie and a falsehood. He has uttered a mendacious imputation and a grievous sin [Harun: grievous matter]. The comparers with Allah have lied and have have gone far astray and have suffered a manifest loss. We have disassociated to Allah the Elevated and His messenger and his family صلوات الله وسلامه ورحمته وبركاته عليهم from him, and have cursed him – the curses of Allah be upon him [Ibn Dawud added: one after the other in succession] – both in the apparent and internally, in secret and in open, all the time, and in all conditions. May it also be upon anyone who allies with him or follows him or to whom reaches this statement and yet continues considering him an authority. Inform them [al-Saymari: may Allah be your guardian] [Ibn Dhaka said: may Allah strengthen you] that we are on our guard [Ibn Dawud: know that we are on guard towards him] [Harun said: inform them that we are on guard] and precautious of him [Ibn Dawud and Harun then add: the way those who came before us had been towards his predecessors] [al-Saymari: the way we were towards the likes of him who preceded him] [Ibn Dhaka said: the way one of us who came before was towards his ilk] such as al-Shari’i, al-Numayri, al-Hilali, al-Bilali and others. Despite this, the practice of Allah [Ibn Dawud and Harun added: Majestic is His praise] in our estimation has always been beautiful, both before him and after him, in Him we trust, and from Him do we seek aid, and He is sufficient for us in all our affairs and the best disposer. Harun said: Abu Ali took this Tawqi and did not leave a single one of the Shuyukh except that he read it to him, and it was written down from them from his copy in the rest of the towns. It became famous in the sect which united in cursing and disavowing him [i.e. al-Shalmaghani]."

Despite his busy schedule, Shaykh Muḥsinī committed himself to this colossal task, motivated by a desire to preserve and make accessible the authentic teachings of the Shīʿī faith. In creating this work, Shaykh Muḥsinī was guided by a set of principles. First, the Ḥadīth should have a reliable chain and not contradict the Qurʾān, the established Sunnah, or the intellect. Second, while the book aims to be comprehensive, it may not include every narration with a reliable chain, since the Shaykh had mentioned that he may have accidentally overlooked some narrations.

A Tawqi came out in the handwriting of the Master of the Age عليه السلام: As for what you have asked about – may Allah guide you and make you firm – regarding those who reject me from among our family members and the sons of our uncle then know that there is no relation between Allah Mighty and Majestic and anyone else. Whoever rejects me then he is not from me and his similitude is like the similitude of the son of Noah. As for the similitude of my paternal uncle Ja’far and his sons then it is like the brothers of Joseph عليه السلام. As for beer then drinking it is forbidden but there is no harm in drinking rye-drink. As for your wealth then we do not accept it except that you become purified, so whoever wishes let him send it and whoever wishes let him withhold it, for what has been given to us by Allah is better than what has been given to you. As for the appearance of the relief then it is up to Allah and the predictors [who put a time to it] have lied! As for the belief of the one who claims that al-Husayn عليه السلام was not killed then it is disbelief, falsehood and misguidance. As for the events which arise then return in them to the narrators of our Hadith for they are my proof over you and I am the proof of Allah over you … As for Muhammad b. Ali b.

Despite his busy schedule, Shaykh Muḥsinī committed himself to this colossal task, motivated by a desire to preserve and make accessible the authentic teachings of the Shīʿī faith. In creating this work, Shaykh Muḥsinī was guided by a set of principles. First, the Ḥadīth should have a reliable chain and not contradict the Qurʾān, the established Sunnah, or the intellect. Second, while the book aims to be comprehensive, it may not include every narration with a reliable chain, since the Shaykh had mentioned that he may have accidentally overlooked some narrations. However, it does provide an overwhelming majority of reliable traditions. Shaykh Muḥsinī’s stringent criteria and rigorous application make this work an invaluable resource in Ḥadīth.

He said: Allah has ninety nine names, if the name was identical to what is named then every name among these [ninety-nine] would be a god, rather Allah is a meaning to which these names point to, and each one of them is other than him.

Ja’far - considering him to be the Master of the Affair after his father. We entered in to meet him while the people were with him. We asked him about the Zakat - at what amount is it to be levied? He said: five silver coins for every two hundred. We said: what about in a hundred silver coins? He said: two and a half silver coins. We said: by Allah this is what the Murjia say! he said: by Allah I do not even know what the Murjia say! He [Hisham] said: So I and Abu Ja’far al-Ahwal came out feeling lost not knowing where to go. We sat down in one of the streets of Madina, with our heads lowered, not knowing where to head or whom to seek. We kept saying to ourselves: Should we join the Murjia, or the Qadariyya, or the Mu’tazila or the Zaydiyya? We were still mulling over this when I saw an old man whom I did not recognize gesturing at me with his hand [to follow him]. I feared that he would turn out to be one of the spies of Abi Ja’far al-Mansur, for he [the Abbasid Caliph] had spies in Madina ready to inform him the identity of the one around whom the people unite after Ja’far so that he [the successor] can be taken and killed. I feared that this was one such spy. I therefore said to al-Ahwal: Depart [from this place] for I fear for both of us, but he only wants me not you, so get away from me to save your life and escape death. He [al-Ahwal] withdrew far away while I followed the old man. I did this because I felt that I could not escape him. I kept following him having readied myself to meet death. He led me until we reached the door of Abi al-Hasan Musa عليه السلام whereupon he left me and departed. Suddenly a servant appeared at the door and said to me: Enter may Allah have mercy on you. I entered and found Abu al-Hasan Musa عليه السلام who said to me without being prompted: To me! To me! Not to the Murjia, nor the Qadariyya, nor the Mu’tazila, nor the Zaydiyya or the Khawarij. I said: May I be made your ransom - has your father passed on? He said: Yes. I said: passed away in death? He said: Yes. I said: Who do we have after him? He said: If Allah the Elevated wishes to guide you He will. I said: May I be made your ransom - your brother Abdallah claims to be the Imam after his father. He said: Abdallah wishes that Allah not be worshipped. I said: May I be made your ransom - who is for us after him [your father]? He said: If Allah wishes to guide you He will. I said: May I be your ransom - is it you? He said: I do not say that. He [Hisham] said: I said to myself [in my heart]: I am not putting the question appropriately. Then I said to him: May I be made your ransom - is there an Imam over you? He said: No. There entered me a feeling of awe and reverence towards him which no one knows about except Allah. Then I said to him: May I be made your ransom - can I ask you the way I used to ask your father? He said: Ask and you will be informed but do not publicize it for if you do that then it will be slaughter. [Hisham says:] I asked him and found him to be an ocean [of knowledge] which does not dry up [is not exhausted]. I said: May I be made your ransom - the Shia of your father are lost should I avail them of this matter and call them to accept you [as the Imam] for you have binded me to secrecy? He said: The one in whom you detect signs of receptivity to guidance then inform him of this and bind him to secrecy for if he publicizes it then it will be slaughter - and he pointed with his hand to his throat. He [Hisham] said: I left his presence and met Aba Ja’far al-Ahwal. He said to me: What is behind you? I said: Guidance! and relayed to him the whole story. Then we encountered Zurara and Aba Basir who both entered in to see him [al-Kadim] and heard his talk and asked him and believed in him. Then we met the people in droves, whoever enters in to meet him [al-Kadhim] believes in him, except for the group led by Ammar al-Sabati [who were Fathis], and the people abandoned Abdallah and no one entered in to see him except very few."

The aim of this comprehensive compilation is to provide people with a dependable resource, countering the long-standing misconception about the perceived insufficiencies in the body of Ḥadīth possessed by the Shīʿa. As such, this project marks a pivotal contribution to the field, providing someone with access to reliable, authentic material. The book showcases Shaykh Muḥsinī’s ambition to assemble a collection of Muʿtabar (reliable) Ḥadīth, thus facilitating the work of jurists, researchers, lecturers, and any layperson interested in gaining knowledge. Despite his busy schedule, Shaykh Muḥsinī committed himself to this colossal task, motivated by a desire to preserve and make accessible the authentic teachings of the Shīʿī faith. In creating this work, Shaykh Muḥsinī was guided by a set of principles. First, the Ḥadīth should have a reliable chain and not contradict the Qurʾān, the established Sunnah, or the intellect. Second, while the book aims to be comprehensive, it may not include every narration with a reliable chain, since the Shaykh had mentioned that he may have accidentally overlooked some narrations. However, it does provide an overwhelming majority of reliable traditions. Shaykh Muḥsinī’s stringent criteria and rigorous application make this work an invaluable resource in Ḥadīth.

[1/291] Rijal al-Kashshi: Muhammad b. Qulawayh al-Qummi from Sa’d b. Abdallah from Muhammad b. Isa from Yunus who said: I heard a man from the Tayyara recounting for Abi al-Hasan al-Ridha عليه السلام that Yunus b. Dhabyan had said: I was making the Tawaf in one of the nights when I heard a call coming from above my head saying: ‘O Yunus - it is I who am Allah there is no god except Me - so worship Me and establish the prayer for my remembrance’ (20:14). I raised my head to look up and lo and behold it was “J” (alluding to Jibril). Abu al-Hasan عليه السلام became furious at hearing this, a fury such that he could barely control himself and said to the man: Get away from me may Allah curse you, may He curse the one who reported this to you, and may He curse Yunus b. Dhabyan a thousand curses followed by another thousand curses, each curse sufficient to expel you to a pit of Hell. I bear witness that no one called out to him except a Shaytan. Verily Yunus is together with Abi al-Khattab in the severest of punishments, bound together with their followers unto that Shaytan, together with Firaun and the people of Firaun in the severest of punishments. I heard this from my father عليه السلام Yunus [b. Abd al-Rahman] said: The man stood up to depart, he had not reached the door and made but ten steps when he fell unconscious, vomited out his excrement and was carried away dead. Abu al-Hasan عليه السلام said: An angel bearing a column came to him and struck him on the head such a blow that his bladder reversed [upside down] and he vomited excretion. Allah hastened his soul to the Hawiya and joined him with his fellow who informed him of this, with Yunus b. Dhabyan, and he saw the Shaytan who used to appear to him."

[12/309] Qasas al-Anbiya: Via his chain to al-Saduq from Ibn al-Mutawakkil from al-Himyari from Ibn Isa from Ibn Mahbub from al-Ahwal from Burayd b. Muawiya who said: I heard Aba Ja’far عليه السلام saying in the Masjid of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وآله: Iblis the accursed was the first to fashion an image in the likeness of Adam so that he could tempt the humans and divert them from the worship of Allah the Elevated. Wadd was one of the sons of Qabil and his (Qabil’s) successor over the rest of his siblings and all those living nearby at the foot of the mountain. They would all revere and follow him. When Wadd died his brothers mourned him greatly. He had placed over them a son called Suwa’ as his successor. But he (Suwa’) could not reach the stature of his father in their estimation. Iblis came to them in the form of an old man and said: ‘I have come to know of your suffering because of the death of Wadd your great one. What would you say if I were to fashion an image in the likeness of Wadd from which you could seek comfort and ease?’ They said: ‘Do it’. The Repulsive One directed himself to lead and melted it until it became liquid. Then he fashioned for them an image in the likeness of Wadd in his house. They turned to the image and began kissing it, and placing their cheeks upon it, and prostrating to it. However, Suwa’ wished that the veneration and prostration be for him, so he sprang upon the image and started scraping it until he had left nothing of it. They (the people) were driven to kill Suwa’ but he admonished them saying: ‘I take the place that was taken by Wadd, I am his son, if you kill me then you will have no chief!’ They inclined to Suwa’ in obeying and showing reverence to him. Suwa’ did not stay long and died. He left behind a son called Yaghuth. They grieved over Suwa’ and Iblis came to them and said: ‘I am the one who fashioned for you an image of Wadd. What do you say to me making for you (an image) in the likeness of Suwa’ in a way that no one will be able to change it?’ They said: ‘Do it’. He directed himself to wood and hewed it then fixed it in the house of Suwa’. That wood was called Khilaf (‘opposite’) because Iblis fashioned the image in an opposite way to (how he had done with) the image of Wadd. He (the Imam) said: they prostrated to him and venerated him. They said to Yaghuth: ‘We do not trust you over this idol, you might scheme against it the way your father schemed against the likeness of Wadd!’. They decided to appoint guards and attendants (to protect the idol). They used to come to the idol on a single day, venerating it more excessively than they used to venerate Suwa’. When Yaghuth saw that he came and killed the guards and attendants one night and crushed the idol to pulp. When news reached them they attempted to kill him but he concealed himself from them until they searched for him and eventually made him their leader and venerated him. Then he died and left behind a son called Ya’uq. Iblis came to them and said: ‘I have come to know of the death of Yaghuth. I am going to make an image of his using something that no one will be able to distort’. They said: ‘Do it’. The Reviled One turned to white stone and hammered it using iron until he had fashioned for them an image of Yaghuth. They venerated it more excessively than all the previous ones. They built for it a room made of stone. They made an oath among themselves that they would not open the door of that room except at the beginning of every new year. What they did was called ‘Bay’a’ on that day (for the first time) for they made a pledge (‘Tabaya’u’) and a pact upon that. This became unbearable for Ya’uq so he took soft sheets and other shabby clothes set them on fire and threw them one night (into that house). The people woke up to find the house, the idol, the guards all burnt down and the remains of the idol discarded. They grieved because of that and desired to kill Ya’uq but he said to them: ‘if you kill your leader then your affairs will disintegrate’ so they decided to hold back. It was not long before Ya’uq died and left a son called Nasr as his successor.Iblis came to them and said: ‘I have come to know of the death of your great one. I will make for you (an image) in the likeness of Ya’uq using something which can never perish’. They said: ‘Do it’. He directed himself towards gold and heated it by fire until it became liquid. Then he sculpted a statue in the likeness of Ya’uq using clay and poured the molten gold into it. He set it up for them in their houses. This became unbearable for Nasr but he could not enter into those houses. He decided to separate himself from them together with a small group of his brothers who worshipped him (Nasr), and the rest kept worshipping the idol (Ya’uq). Then Nasr died and the prophethood of Idris began. He came to know the state of the people. That some worship a body in the likeness of Ya’uq and that Nasr was worshipped by others instead of Allah. He marched to them with those who were with him and decamped in a town whose people supported them (Idris and his followers). They defeated them (the idol-worshippers). Some were killed while others ran away. They (the idol-worshippers) became scattered in the lands. He (Idris) ordered that the idol be brought and it was cast into the sea. Every group (of the scattered remaining idol-worshippers) took for itself an idol and gave them names. They remained like that generation after generation not knowing anything except those names. Then came the prophethood of Nuh. He called them to the worship of Allah alone and abandoning what they used to worship of idols, whereupon some of them said: “do not abandon your gods, do not abandon Wadd, nor Suwa’ nor Yaghuth, nor Ya’uq nor Nasr”."

Despite his busy schedule, Shaykh Muḥsinī committed himself to this colossal task, motivated by a desire to preserve and make accessible the authentic teachings of the Shīʿī faith. In creating this work, Shaykh Muḥsinī was guided by a set of principles. First, the Ḥadīth should have a reliable chain and not contradict the Qurʾān, the established Sunnah, or the intellect. Second, while the book aims to be comprehensive, it may not include every narration with a reliable chain, since the Shaykh had mentioned that he may have accidentally overlooked some narrations. However, it does provide an overwhelming majority of reliable traditions. Shaykh Muḥsinī’s stringent criteria and rigorous application make this work an invaluable resource in Ḥadīth. While some scholars may differ with his judgments, the work aims to provide a universally acceptable core of irreproachable narrations, with the potential to serve as a basis for consensus among scholars and researchers.

[2/-] Ilal al-Sharai: al-Hamdani, al-Mukatib and al-Warraq all together from Ali from his father from al-Fadhl b. Yunus who said: Ibn Abil Awja was among the students of al-Hasan al-Basri but then deviated from Tawhid. It was said to him: You have left the Madhhab of your fellow (Hasan al-Basri) and entered into that (belief) which has no authentic origin nor any reality. He said: My fellow was confused. Sometimes he would assert belief in free-will and sometimes predestination. I have not known him to hold on to a position and stick to it. He traveled to Makka and began showing arrogance and opposition to those making the pilgrimage. The scholars would dislike sitting and debating with him because of the vulgarity of his tongue and his corrupt heart (intentions). He came to Aba Abdillah عليه السلام and sat in his presence (circle) together with a number of his peers. He said: O Aba Abdillah, discussions are conducted with guarantee of protection (against persecution for what is said) and it is incumbent for every one who has a question to ask. Do you allow me to speak? Al-Sadiq عليه السلام said: Speak whatever you wish (freely) … Ibn Abil Awja said: You spoke of Allah and thus settled (put your hand) upon one who is Hidden. Abu Abdillah عليه السلام said: Woe be upon you! How can He be hidden one who is witnessed (evident) through His creatures, and is closer to him (his creature) than the jugular vein. He hears their speech, observes their forms and knows their secrets. Ibn Abil Awja said: That would mean He is everywhere. Is it not the case that if He were in heaven how can He also be on earth? And if He is on earth how can He be in heaven (at the same time)? Abu Abdillah عليه السلام said: You have described a created thing which if it departs from a place then one place is occupied by him and another place becomes empty of him, and he cannot know what is happening in the place he used to be in from the place he has moved to. As for Allah The Great in Stature, the King and Judge, then no space is empty of Him, nor does He occupy space, nor is He closer to one point with respect to another."

He said: He is One. Unique in Essence. Distinct from His creation. That is how He described Himself. He encompasses everything in terms of supervision, awareness and power. Nothing escapes Him even the weight of a particle in the Heavens and in the earth nor smaller than that or bigger - in terms of awareness and knowledge not by (His) essence, for locations are bounded, delimited by the four bounds (height, width, depth), so if it was by essence then that would necessarily imply containment."

[1/320] al-Kafi: Ahmad b. Idris from Muhammad b. Abd al-Jabbar from Safwan b. Yahya who said: Abu Qurra the Hadith scholar asked me to seek permission for him to enter upon Abi al-Hasan al-Ridha عليه السلام. I sought permission and he (the Imam) granted it to me. He (Abu Qurra) entered and asked him about the Halal, Haram and the rulings until he reached the topic of Tawhid. Abu Qurra said: We have narrated that Allah divided vision and speech between two prophets. He gave speech to Musa and vision to Muhammad. Abu al-Hasanعليه السلام said: Then who was it who conveyed on the authority of Allah to the Two Weighty ones from the Jinn and humans (the following): “sights do not reach him” (6:103), “they do not encompass Him in (their) knowledge” (20:110) and “there is nothing like Him” (42:11) - is it not Muhammad? He (Abu Qurra) said: Yes (it was). (The Imam said:) How can a man come to all creation and inform them that he has come from Allah and that he is calling them to Allah by the command of Allah and say: “sights do not reach him”, “they do not encompass Him in (their) knowledge”, “there is nothing like Him” and then say: I have seen Him by my eye and have encompassed Him in knowledge - he is in the form of a man?!Do you not feel ashamed?! Even the heretics did not dare accuse him of this - that he (the prophet) would come with something from Allah and then later come with something contradicting that! Abu Qurra said: He (Allah) says: “and he (Muhammad) surely saw Him in another descent” (53:13). Abu al-Hasan عليه السلام said: there is after this verse an indication of what he saw when He said: “the heart did not lie about what it saw” (53:11). He is saying: Muhammad’s heart did not lie about what his eyes saw - then He specifies what he saw when He said: “he saw of the great signs of his Lord” (53:18) - the signs of Allah are not Allah. Allah said: “they do not encompass Him in (their) knowledge” - if eyes could see Him then knowledge has encompassed Him and realization (of Allah) has been attained.Abu Qurra said: So you reject the narrations? Abu al-Hasan عليه السلام said: If the narrations are opposed to the Qur’an then I reject them. Furthermore, what the Muslims are united upon is that He is not encompassed in knowledge, sights do not reach Him, and there is nothing like Him."

Air which the eye can penetrate through. If there is no air between the viewer and the viewed - vision cannot take place. And this (needing air in between) would entail likening (Allah to His creatures). Because whenever the viewer becomes equivalent with the viewed in terms of sharing the condition necessary for vision between them (to occur) then they would necessarily be alike (in some manner) and that would be anthropomorphism.

They are the ones through whom (one) turns (lit. his face) towards Allah Mighty and Majestic, His religion and recognition of Him. Allah Mighty and Majestic said: “Whoever is on it will perish and will remain the face of your Lord” (55:26-27) and He Mighty and Majestic also said: “Everything is to be destroyed except His face” (28:88), thus, looking at the prophets of Allah, His messengers and proofs عليهم السلام in their stations is a great reward for the believers on the day of judgment. The prophet صلى الله عليه واله said: “Whoever hates the people of my Household and my descendants will never see me nor will I see him on the day of judgment” and he صلى الله عليه واله also said: “There is among you one who will never see me (again) after separating from me (in this world)”. O Aba Salt - Allah Blessed and Elevated is not described as being in space and neither sights nor imaginations can reach Him. He (Abu Salt) said: I said to him: O the son of the Messenger of Allah - inform me about Paradise and the Fire - are they already created at this moment? He said: Yes. The Messenger of Allah صلى الله عليه واله entered Paradise and saw the Fire when he was made to ascend to Heaven. He (Abu Salt) said: I said to him: There is a group which says that ‘they (Paradise and Hell) are only destined to be at this moment but not yet created’. He said: Such (people) are not from us nor are we from them. Whoever denies the creation of Paradise and the Fire has belied the prophet and has belied us. Such a one has nothing to do with our Wilaya and will abide forever in the Fire of Hell. Allah Mighty and Majestic says: “this is Hell which the criminals deny. They will go around between it and scalding water” (55:43-44) and the prophet صلى الله عليه واله said: “When I was made to ascend to Heaven, Jibril took me by the hand and made me to enter Paradise. He handed me one of its fruits. I ate it and it formed seed in my loin. When I returned to the earth I met with Khadija and she became pregnant with Fatima - a human Houri. Whenever I desire to smell the scent of paradise I smell the scent of my daughter Fatima”."
Muʿjam al-Aḥādīth al-Muʿtabara,A Comprehensive Compilation of Reliable Narrations,,Shaykh Muḥammad Āṣif al-Muḥsinī,Ammaar Muslim,"""Muʿjam al-Aḥādīth al-Muʿtabara"" by Shaykh Muḥammad Āṣif Muḥsinī is a monumental work which fills a significant gap in the realm of the works of Ḥadīth. The aim of this comprehensive compilation is to provide people with a dependable resource, countering the long-standing misconception about the perceived insufficiencies in the body of Ḥadīth possessed by the Shīʿa. As such, this project marks a pivotal contribution to the field, providing someone with access to reliable, authentic material. The book showcases Shaykh Muḥsinī’s ambition to assemble a collection of Muʿtabar (reliable) Ḥadīth, thus facilitating the work of jurists, researchers, lecturers, and any layperson interested in gaining knowledge. Despite his busy schedule, Shaykh Muḥsinī committed himself to this colossal task, motivated by a desire to preserve and make accessible the authentic teachings of the Shīʿī faith. In creating this work, Shaykh Muḥsinī was guided by a set of principles. First, the Ḥadīth should have a reliable chain and not contradict the Qurʾān, the established Sunnah, or the intellect. Second, while the book aims to be comprehensive, it may not include every narration with a reliable chain, since the Shaykh had mentioned that he may have accidentally overlooked some narrations. However, it does provide an overwhelming majority of reliable traditions. Shaykh Muḥsinī’s stringent criteria and rigorous application make this work an invaluable resource in Ḥadīth. While some scholars may differ with his judgments, the work aims to provide a universally acceptable core of irreproachable narrations, with the potential to serve as a basis for consensus among scholars and researchers. In summary, ""Muʿjam al-Aḥādīth al-Muʿtabara"" is a milestone in Ḥadīth studies, providing a reliable reference point for those interested in authentic Shia narrations.

The meaning of this is (a reply to) when they said: ‘the entire earth will be His grip on the Day of Resurrection and the heavens will be folded in His right hand’. This is just as He Mighty and Majestic said: “they have not estimated Allah His true estimate” (6:91) when they said: “Allah has not sent down anything to a human” (6:91).

He is the First before everything and He is the Last - as He has never stopped (being). Different names and attributes do not apply to Him (at different times) as they do to other than Him. Like a human who is at one point clay, at another point flesh and blood, and lastly remains and decay. Or like the dates which are at one point green-in-colour and incipient (Balah), at another point coloured but not ripe (Busr), at another point fresh and ripe (Rutab), and lastly dry (Tamr).

Its meticulous assembly and rigorous criteria set it apart as a work of significant value and authority.",5 | The Book of the Glorious Quran,Chapter 10 | Essay on the Question of Tahrif,Ḥadīth #1,-,"* Difference between Tanzil and Qur’an Know - may Allah assist you with His assistance - that the totality of the Qur’an is a divine revelation sent down (by Allah), considered to be so by all Muslims as per necessity (bil Dharura), and not on the basis of arguments set forth by the ancient philosophers and natural scientists to demonstrate its divine origin which are all insufficient without any doubt. However, not everything that was revealed or sent down is part of the Qur’an, for Allah the Elevated revealed and sent down to his final Messenger some matters, relayed by the Muslims (from him) on separate occasions, of which there is no trace in the Qur’an. For example, there is in al-Bukhari in the chapter on the merit of the Qur’an a report on the authority of Safwan from his father Ya’la who witnessed a man inquiring from the prophet: O Messenger of Allah, what do you say about a man who assumes the Ihram (for Umra) in a cloak after he has applied perfume (on himself)? So the prophet waited for a while and revelation came … then he regained his composure and said: Where is the one who asked me about the Umra a short while ago? The man was sought out and brought to the prophet - who said: As for the perfume that is on you then wash it thrice, and as for the cloak then take it off, and do in your Umra the way you do in your Hajj It is evident that this ruling is not to be found in the Qur’an, and there are many similar examples both in the Hadith and history. Based on this, the reports which have come down concerning certain verses which say that a phrase ‘came down in this way’, that is, with an addition beyond what is available in the Qur’an today, do not necessarily indicate deficiency in the Qur’an and its Tahrif (alteration) as has been assumed by some, either because of limited thinking or rebellious opposition. For the ‘general’ does not indicate the ‘specific’ (i.e. since revelation is wider than what is Qur’an-proper then such reports should not be taken as limited to the latter). * Different Kinds of Tahrif In addition, the word Tahrif is used with different meanings in mind: 1. Moving something from its original location and transferring it to someplace else “among those who have become Jews are some who displace words from their (rightful) places” (4:46), and there is no doubt in the occurrence of this type of Tahrif in the Qur’an, for whoever interprets the Qur’an with other than its actual meaning and by making use of his opinion and desires then he has made Tahrif in it. 2. Omission or addition at the level of letters or in vocalization while acknowledging the preservation of the Qur’an without anything being lost. Tahrif with this meaning has also occurred without any doubt since the different Qira’at are not Mutawatir (consecutively transmitted back to the prophet), thus the Qur’an that came down may align with one of the Qira’at and the other Qira’at (where they differ) are instances of addition or omission. 3. Tahrif in addition or omission at the level of a verse or a chapter while acknowledging the preservation of the Qur’an without anything being lost. This has also occurred, like in the Basmala, wherein all the Muslims admit that the prophet recited it before every chapter except al-Bara’a but there has occurred difference about whether it is part of the Qur’an or not? Thus the Shia and a large number of the Sunnis hold the former (it is part of the Qur’an) while another group of the Sunnis hold the latter (i.e. it is not) 4. Tahrif of addition, in the sense that a part of the Mushaf that is between our hands (available to us today) is not Divine revelation. This is something that not a single one from among the Muslims upholds. In fact, it has been said that the invalidity of this position is known by necessity (bil Dharura) 5. Tahrif of omission, in the sense that the Mushaf that is between our hands does not include the whole Qur’an, rather a part of it has become lost to the Umma (community). And this is subject to dispute. The famous and well-recognized position among the Shia is to also negate this, in opposition to a group among them (i.e. the Shia) and a group of the Sunnis (who uphold it). Our teacher Sayyid al-Khoei has addressed the question in an in-depth and convincing manner in his book al-Bayan, whoever wishes to acquaint himself with the truth of the matter should make reference to it from Pg. 225 to Pg. 254, the latest edition printed in Kuwait. * A Second Glance at the Reports of the Previous Section Reports with reliable chains that indicate omission in the Qur’an from the paths of the Shia are very few as you have seen in the previous section. A researcher may perhaps also find a few other instances in this book (i.e. all 8 vols. of Mu’jam) not included in the previous section. I do not think there are 10 reliable-in-chain reports which can be used as evidence in some way for the Tahrif of the Qur’an in the sense that is disputed (i.e. No. 5 above). So how far from correctness is the claim of the one who claims the presence of 2000 reports in this regard! Even worse is when a group of those who harbor enmity, the Nussab (haters) and the people of falsehood cite this claim as a means to revile and attack the Shia of the family of Muhammad “so leave them toying away in their vain talk” (6:91). As for reports in this regard by paths of the Ahl al-Sunna then they are plentiful, found in their authentic compilations, in fact, some of them assert the loss of two full chapters from the Qur’an, and a full discussion of these reports is left for its appropriate place. Having said this, the famous and widely accepted position, both among them and us, is the preservation of the Qur’an from any omission, so it is not permitted to stir up controversy in the matter, nor is a contrary position brought up except by provocateurs who are hired to weaken Islam or bigoted fools who seek position in the eyes of the crowds “and Allah does not support the work of the corruptors” (10:81) It should not be said that the Qur’an which was recorded by the Commander of the Faithful has not reached us, and that whoever studies the accounts of the writing down of the Qur’an by the companions in the rule of Abu Bakr and Uthman with the attendant lack of resources in those times may attain strong conjecture or even confidence concerning the deficiency of that which was collected by the companions - so how do you reject this? I (i.e. Muhsini) say: Yes (this would be true) if it weren’t for the fact that the Muslims preserved the Qur’an on the surface (of their hearts). Thus the reliance of the compilers and gatherers was not merely on tablets and written inscriptions but upon what they had memorized in their hearts, a fulfillment of His words the Exalted “And We will certainly preserve it” (15:9) - so understand the point."

We consider argumentation about the Qur’an to be a Bidʿa (innovation) in which both questioner and respondent have partaken. So the questioner (i.e. who asks about this) has engaged in what is not for him (i.e. his concern) and the respondent has borne what is not on him (i.e. his responsibility to bear). There is no creator except Allah, and what is other than Him is created. The Qur’an is the Speech of Allah. Do not coin a word for it from yourself so you will become among the astray.
