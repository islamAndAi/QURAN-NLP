Asma’ said, ‘O Prophet of God! May my parents be your ransom! Why are you crying?’ The Prophet (S) replied, ‘I am crying for this (grand)son of mine.’ Asma’ said, ‘O Prophet of God! He was just born!’ The Prophet (S) said, ‘O Asma’! After my death, oppressors will kill him. May God deprive them of my intercession.’ Then the Prophet (S) added, ’O Asma’!

I established Ali as his brother; Trustee; Minister; the one to fulfill the Prophet’s mission for the creatures after him; as My Regent over My creatures to clarify My Book for them; and to carry out My orders amongst them. I established Ali as the guiding knowledge away from deviation; as a gate to approach Me; as a house to which whoever enters is secure from My Fire; as My castle in which whoever takes refuge is immune from the abominable things in this world and the Hereafter; as a face to which whoever turns to I will not turn My Face away from him; as My Proof in the heavens and the Two Earths over all My creatures. No one’s deeds are accepted unless they bear witness to Ali’s Mastery and the Prophethood of My Messenger Muhammad. He is My hand that is extended over My servants. He is the blessing which I have bestowed upon those of My servants whom I love.Therefore, I taught Ali’s Mastery and recognition to whichever one of My servants whom I liked. I disliked some of My servants due to their deviation from recognizing him and his Mastery. Thus I swear by MyMajesty that I will fend off the Fire from whoever of My servants who loves Ali. I will take them to Paradise. I will get angry with and enter into the Fire whichever of My servants who deviates from his Mastery. They will have a terrible ending.”"

Perform the good deeds that you neglected to do during all this month in the few remaining days. I advise you to do what is beneficial for you, and abandon doing what is of no use for you. Increase the amount of supplications, asking for God’s forgiveness, reciting the Qur’an, making repentance to God for the sins you have committed so that God turns towards you in this month while you have been sincere with your Lord - the Honorable the Exalted. Do not let the responsibility for anything you have been entrusted with remain on your shoulders. Return them to their owners. Do not let any hate for any believers remain in your heart. Throw it away. Do not let any sins that you have committed remain. Get rid of them. Fear God and rely on Him regarding your private and public affairs. God suffices for whoever relies on Him since God is one who perfects His acts. He has indeed established a destiny for everything. You should often say the following in the remaining days of this month, ‘O my God! If you have not forgiven us up until this time of the month, I beg of Thee to forgive us during the remaining period of this month’ as God the Blessed the Sublime frees many people from the Fire during this month for the respect they hold for the (Arabic) month of Ramadhan.’”"

Is it not so that God’s Prophet (S) and your forefathers did this while wearing their rings?’ The Imam replied, ‘Yes. But they wore their rings on their right hand.’ Then the Imam added, ‘Fear God and take care of yourself.’Al-Husayn ibn Khalid al-Sayrafi asked the Imam , ‘What was the mark on the ring of the Commander of the Faithful?’ The Imam said, ‘Why don’t you ask about that of the people before him?’Then Al-Husayn ibn Khalid al-Sayrafi said, ‘O.K. Now I will ask. What was marked on the ring of Adam ?’ The Imam replied, ‘It was There is no god but God. Muhammad is the Messenger of God. Adam descended to Earth with that ring. When Noah was about to board the Ark, the Honorable the Exalted God revealed to him, ‘O Noah! If you fear that you will be drowned say There in no god but Allah one-thousand times and then ask me to rescue you from getting drowned and save those who are with you.’ When Noah and the people with him climbed aboard the Ark and he released the cable, it became stormy. Noah feared to get drowned when the storm got stronger. He did not have enough time to say There is no god but God one-thousand times. So in the Soriani language he said, Haylolia hizar hizar ya marya, ya marya, ayqen meaning Haylolia a thousand times, a thousand times. O Waves! Calm down! The waves calmed down and the Ark came to a steady condition. Noah said, ‘Now that the Words of God have saved me, they deserve to never be separated from me.’ Thus he put down There is no god but God a thousand times O Lord! Improve me.The Imam added, ‘When Abraham was placed on the catapult Gabriel got angry. The Honorable the Exalted God sent him a revelation and asked, ‘O Gabriel! What made you angry?’ Gabriel said, ‘O Lord! This is Your friend! There is no one else on the Earth who worships you. Now You have let Your enemy and his overcome him (Abraham).’ Then the Honorable the Exalted God revealed to Gabriel, ‘Relax! Rushing is for someone like you who is scared of death. But as for Me, I consider him to be My savant and can attend to him whenever I wish.’ Thus Gabriel’s soul calmed down and went to Abraham and said, ‘Do you need anything?’ Abraham said, ‘Nothing but good for you.’ Then the Honorable the Exalted God sent Gabriel down to him with a ring on which it was written There is no god but God. Muhammad is the Messenger of God. There is no power nor any strength save by God. I entrust my affairs to God. I rely on God. God suffices for me. God sent him a message which said, ‘Put on this ring and I will make the fire cool and healthy for you.’ The Imam added, ‘There were two statements from the Old Testament on Moses’ ring meaning, Persevere to get rewarded. Tell the truth to be saved. The Imam added, ‘That which was marked on Solomon’s ring means, Glorified is He who controlled the genies with His words. And the following taken from the Bible wasinscribed on Jesus’ ring, Prosperous be the one whom God makes him remember his death. Woe be to one whom God makes him forget his death. That which was marked on Muhammad’s ring was, There is no god but God. Muhammad is God’s Messenger. That which was marked on the Commander of the Faithful’s ring means, Sovereignty is for God. That which was marked on Al-Hassan ibn Ali’s ring means, Honor is for God. That which was marked on Al-Husayn’s ring means, God will carry out His affairs. That which was marked on Ali ibn Al-Husayn’s ring was the same as that which was marked on his father Al-Husayn’s ring. That which was marked on Muhammad ibn Ali’s ring was the same as that which was marked on Al-Husayn’s ring. That which was marked on Ja’far ibn Muhammad’s ring means, God is my Master and He guards me against His creatures. That which was marked on Abil Hassan Musa ibn Ja’far’s ring means, God suffices for me.Al-Husayn ibn Khalid said, “Abul Hassan Ar-Ridha’ opened up his hand and showed me his father’s ring that was in his hand and what was marked on it.”In another tradition it has been narrated that ‘Khazeya Wa Shaqeya Qatil Al-Husayn ibn Ali’ was marked on Ali ibn Al-Husayn’s ring which means ‘the murderer of Al-Husayn - the son of Ali - is contemptuous and miserable.’"

God considered those who followed Noah to be of his family.” Al-Washsha’ said that the Imam asked him, “How is this verse about Noah’s son recited?” Al-Washsha’ answered, “The people recite it in two different ways one form of which implies that he was not Noah’s son.” The Imam said, “No, they are liars. He was Noah’s son. However, the Honorable the Exalted God denounced him from being Noah’s son due to his opposition to Noah’s religion.”"

When Joseph reached Jacob, she arrived there also claiming that the belt had been lost. They searched Joseph’s body and found the belt on him. That was why when Joseph found the drinking cup in his brother’s saddle-bag which he himself had hidden there, his brothers said, ‘…If he steals, there was a brother of his who did steal before (him).’ Then Joseph asked them, ‘What is the punishment of the one in whose saddle-bag the drinking cup is found?’ They said, ‘The penalty should be that he in whose saddle-bag it is found, should be held (as bondman) to atone for the (crime)…’ as it is our tradition. Then ‘So he began (the search) with their baggage, before (he came to) the baggage of his brother: at length he brought it out of his brother’s baggage…’ That is why Joseph’s brothers said, ‘If he steals, there was a brother of his who did steal before (him).’ They were referring to that belt. ‘…But these things did Joseph keep locked in his heart, revealing not the secrets to them.’”"

This has been the Sublime God’s decree in the past and it will be so for the future as the Honorable the Exalted God said, ‘But when they saw Our Punishment, they said, We believe in God - the one God - and we reject the partners we used to join with Him.’ But their professing the Faith when they (actually) saw Our Punishment was not going to profit them. (a.s.uch has been) God’s Way of dealing with His Servants (from the most ancient times). And even thus did the Rejecters of God perish (utterly)!’ And the Honorable the Exalted God has also said, ‘…the day that certain of the signs of thy Lord do come, no good will it do to a soul to believe in them then; if he believed not before nor earned righteousness through its faith. Say: Wait ye: we too are waiting.’ When Pharaoh was about to drown ‘…he said, I believe thatthere is no god except Him Whom the Children of Israel believe in: I am of those who submit (to God in Islam).’ It was said to him, ‘Ah now! But a little while before, wast thou in rebellion! And thou didst mischief (and violence)! This day shall We save thee in the body, that thou mayest be a sign to those who come after thee! But verily, many among mankind are heedless of Our Signs!’ Pharaoh was armed to the teeth wearing iron armor. When he was drowned, God threw him up on a high piece of land so that he would be a sign for the people who came later. They could see him on the high land with all his heavy iron weapons. Iron is heavy and it will naturally submerge. That is why this in itself was a sign. Another reason that the Honorable the Exalted God drowned Pharaoh was that he sought help from Moses when he realized that he was going to be drowned, and he did not seek God’s help. Then the Honorable the Exalted God revealed to Moses , ‘O Moses! You did not help Pharaoh since you had not created him. Had he asked Me for help, I would have saved him.’”"

Solomon stopped and called in that ant and asked it, ‘Don’t you know that I am God’s Prophet and I will not oppress anyone?’ The ant said, ‘Yes.’ Solomon said, ‘Then why did you make them afraid of me oppressing them?’ The ant said, ‘I feared that they might see Your Majesty and get so attracted to you that they forget the Sublime God’s remembrance.’ Then the ant asked, ‘Is your rank higher or that of your father David?’ Solomon said, ‘My father David!’ The ant said, ‘However, your name has one more letter than your father’s name David. Doesn’t it?’ Solomon said, ‘I have no knowledge of this.’ The ant said, ‘No. Your father David’s name was actually ‘Davi jorha (meaning that David heals). Then he was called David. I hope you canreach the rank of your father.’ Then the ant added, ‘Do you know why God did not make things other than the wind subservient to you in His Kingdom?’ Solomon said, ‘I do not know.’ The ant said, ‘The Honorable the Exalted God wanted to teach you that if He had made everything else subservient to you, they would also end as fast as the wind does, and you would lose them as fast as the wind.’ Solomon laughed at this.”"

Abul Hassan Ar-Ridha’ told him, “Indeed magic was popular when the Blessed the Sublime God appointed Moses . That is why he was given the miracle of negating the effect of magic by the Honorable the Exalted God, which the people did not possess. There was none like it within their powers. Therefore, he nullified their magic and proved his rightfulness to them. The Blessed the Sublime God appointed Jesus at a time when untreatable illnesses existed and the people needed medicine and a doctor. Therefore he gave them what they did not have the like of from the Honorable the Exalted God with which he (Jesus ) brought their dead back to life, gave sight to those born blind, and treated those suffering from elephantiasis and leprosy, all with God’s permission and thereby proving his rightfulness to them. And the Blessed the Sublime God appointed Muhammad at a time when eloquent speech was common. I think he also added in poetry. Therefore he used the Honorable the Exalted God’s Book with its wise sayings, decrees, disproof of the claims of the atheists, and the proof of his own claims and perfected his proof for them.” Ibn al-Sikkit said, ‘I swear by God that I have never seen anyone like you in these times. Tell me, who is the Proof of God for the creatures today.’ Imam Ar-Ridha’ said, “It is the intellect which can recognize him who tells the truth about God, acknowledges Him, and recognizes and denounces one who lies about God.” Then Ibn al-Sikkit said, ‘I swear by God that this is the correct answer.’”"

The Prophets that came after Abraham all followed Abraham’s laws. The laws and the ways of Abraham were followed by all the Prophets that came after Abraham until Moses . Then after Moses , the Prophets followed his laws and ways and adhered to his Book until the time of Jesus . All the Prophets at the time of Jesus and after him followed his laws and ways and adhered to his Book until the time of our Prophet Muhammad (S).

No Prophet will ever come after him until the Resurrection Day. It is incumbent to kill whoever claims Prophethood after him or brings a book after the Qur’an for anyone who hears his claim.’”"

He should leave the dead, since making the ablutions for the dead is a part of the tradition (of the Prophet (S) and is not obligatory).”"

However, there is another reason for that. Indeed the Honorable the Exalted God has made it incumbent upon His servants to perform five obligatory deeds: praying, paying the alms-tax, fasting, going on the Hajj pilgrimage, and accepting the Mastery (of the Immaculate Imams). Therefore, He has established saying God is the Greatest once for eachof the obligatory deeds. If he has accepted the Mastery (of the Immaculate Imams), then it should be said five times. However, if he has not accepted it, the phrase God is the Greatest should be said only four times. That is why when one of you (the Shiites) die, the phrase is said five times. However, when one who disagrees with you (i.e. is not one of the Shiites) dies, the phrase is said only four times."

Why is it that the nuptial gift for women is set at five-hundred Dirhams equivalent to 12.5 Okes.” Ar-Ridha’ replied, “The Honorable the Exalted God has made it incumbent upon Himself that if any believer says God is the Greatest one hundred times; Praise be to God one hundred times; Glory be to God one hundred times; There is no god but God one hundred times; Blessings be upon Muhammad and his Household one-hundred times; and O my God! Please marry off one of the houris to me, God will marry off one of the houris to him. That is why the nuptial gift of the believing women has been determined to be five-hundred Dirhams. If anyone turns down the request of a believing courter who wants to marry a woman with the nuptial gift of five-hundred Dirhams, and then he does not marry her off to the courter, has indeed harmed him. Then it is the right of the Honorable the Exalted God not to marry off a houri to him.”"

She will no longer be legitimate for him until after she marries someone else. This is established so that the people do not underestimate divorce and do not misuse women.”"

The noblest member of his nation is Ali . And after him the kindness of Ali for them is like the kindness of the Prophet (S), since he is the Prophet’s Trustee, Successor and the Divine Leader after the Prophet (S). That is why the Prophet (S) said, “Ali and I are the two fathers of this nation.” God’s Prophet (S) climbed up the pulpit and said, “Whoever leaves behind a debt or a wife, I must repay his debt and pay for the living expenses of his wife. Whoever leaves behind some property, that property will belong to his inheritors.” That is why the Prophet (S) was superior to their fathers, mothers and even themselves. The same thing held true for the Commander of the Faithful after God’s Prophet (S).”"

May God not let me live after you! I testify that you are the inheritor of the knowledge of God’s Prophet (S).” Abi Salt (al-Harawi) added, “When Ar-Ridha’ returned home, I went to see him and said, “O son of God’s Prophet!

The Imam replied, “No, she is not illegal.” All the jurists wrote him a letter in which it was written, “O son of God’sProphet! How and why do you consider her not to be illegal for him.” The Imam wrote the following in a corner of their letter, “This is based on the tradition which you yourselves have narrated on the authority of Sa’eed al-Khodri in which it is narrated that after the conquest of Mecca, God’s Prophet (S) expressed that ‘You are of the good ones, and my companions are of the good ones’ to those who expressed submission to God and became Muslim when many of them had gathered around the Prophet (S). However, the Prophet (S) said, ‘There will be no migration after victory.’ Thus the Prophet (S) abolished migration after the victory of Mecca, and considered them (including Mo’awiya) not to be his companions.” When the jurists read the answer they changed their decree to that of Imam Ar-Ridha’ ."

that his uncle Muhammad ibn Abil Qasim quoted on the authority of Muhammad ibn Abi Abdillah al-Kufi, on the authority of Muhammad ibn San’an, and also Ali ibn Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Imran al-Daqqaq, Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-San’ani, Ali ibn Abdullah al-Var’raq and Al-Husayn ibn Ibrahim ibn Ahmad ibn Hisham al-Mokattib - may God be pleased with them - narrated that Muhammad ibnAli al-Kufi quoted on the authority of Muhammad ibn Isma’il, on the authority of Ali ibn Al-Abbas, on the authority of Al-Qasim ibn Al-Rabi’a As-Sah’haf, on the authority of Muhammad ibn San’an, and also Ali ibn Ahmad ibn Abdullah Al-Barqi, Ali ibn Isa - the neighbor to the Kufa Mosque, and Abu Ja’far Muhammad ibn Musa - may God have Mercy upon them - narrated that Muhammad ibn Ali Majilawayh, quoted on the authority of Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Khalid, on the authority of his father, on the authority of Muhammad ibn San’an that Abal Hassan Ali ibn Musa Ar-Ridha’ wrote the following reasons (behind the decrees) in response to Muhammad ibn San’an’s questions:And the reason behind the obligatory ritual ablution (ghusl) for the major ritual impurity is to cleanse and purify man’s self from what has impurified him. And another reason is to purify the rest of the body from impurities as impurities have come out from all over the body. That is why it is obligatory to clean the whole body.And the reason behind the lesser decree about urination and defecation is the frequency of these acts compared to that of the major ritual impurity, the hardships involved, and the fact that there is no will in doing these acts and there is no lust involved in doing them. However, there is lust in major ritual impurity and it is the result of an intentional act.And the reasons behind the ritual ablution on the two major festivals and on Fridays, and other cases is to express a servant’s honoring of his Lord, prepare himself for Him - the Glorious the Magnificent to ask Him to forgive his sins. Another reason is that they are the holidays which are known to be for congregations in remembrance of the Sublime God. Therefore, God has established the ritual ablution on these days as a way to honor these days and to make them superior to other days - days in which many recommendable prayers are said, much servitude is expressed, and it is a way of purification from one Friday to the next.And the reason behind the major ablution for the dead is to cleanse the corpse from the various filth, illnesses and other things that might have fallen upon him, since the dead person is going to meet the angels and associate with the people of the Hereafter.It is highly desirable for him to be clean and pure now that he is going to meet God and the Pure Ones where they will touch him and he will touch them. This is so that the Pure Ones may ask the Honorable the Exalted God to forgive him and they may intercede on his behalf.And another reason behind the major ablution for the dead is that once he dies, the sperm with which he was at first created with will be discharged from his body and he will be in a state of major ritual impurity. Thus others must perform the major ablution for him.And the reason why once you perform the major ritual ablution for the dead or touch someone’s corpse you must perform the major ritual ablution yourself is to be cleansed of the filth from the corpse that might have touched your body. That is because once someone dies and his soul departs from the body, most of the impurities remain in his body. Therefore, one must do so to get cleaned and purified therefrom. And the reason behind making minor ablutions (wudu) - in which it is prescribed to wash the face, the two arms, rubbing the head, and rubbing the upper side of the feet - is that man wants to stand in front of the Honorable the Exalted God, facing Him and visiting the Honorable Recorders (Kiram Katibin) with all his apparent body parts. Then washing the face is for prostration and humbleness, washing the two arms is for preparing them to be held up towards the heavens, implore and fear God with them and use them to sincerely turn towards the worship of God. The rubbing of the head and the feet is because they are apparent in all positions of the prayer and in them there is not as much humbleness and sincerity of worship as there is in the face and the two hands.And the reason behind the alms-tax is to aid the poor and protect the properties of the rich, as the Blessed the Sublime God has ordained that the healthy assist those afflicted with calamities. As the Sublime God has said, ‘Ye shall certainly be tried and tested in your possessions and in your personal selves…’ The way you are tried by your possessions is by paying the alms-tax, and the way you are tried by your personal selves is by getting yourselves prepared to be patient during calamities. In paying the alms-tax there is a fulfillment of gratitude for the blessings granted to us by the Honorable the Exalted God, an eagerness to have more of them, kindness and mercy for the weak, and kindness with the poor. And also there is an increased inclination towards sympathizing with the poor; assisting the poor and helping them regarding their religious affairs and a lesson for the rich to take heed to seeing their poorness in the Hereafter; and encouragement to thank the Blessed the Sublime God for what He has bestowed upon us and hasmade us needless of. And also there is an encouragement to pray, cry, and fear that we may become poor like them one day. And also there is an encouragement in performing many deeds similar to paying the alms-tax such as charity, visiting the relatives and being kind to others.And the reason behind the Hajj pilgrimage is that it is a form of getting near to God, asking Him for extensive rewards, departing from all the sins that one has committed, to be repentant for all that he has done in the past, and to start what he will do in the future. The pilgrimage is also for experiencing the expenditures of his wealth and exert himself; avoiding lust and pleasure so as to seek nearness to the Honorable the Exalted God. The pilgrimage is also for feeling humility and courtesy; suffering from the difficulties of the trip in the various conditions of heat, cold, security and fear for a long span of time. The benefits in the Hajj pilgrimage for the people include asking the Honorable the Exalted God for the fulfillment of our needs; abandoning relentlessness of the heart; abandoning the daring of the self; abandoning forgetfulness to remember God; abandoning lack of hope and engaging in action; renewal of the rights; preventing the self from getting corrupt; benefiting the people in the East or the West of the Earth - whether they live in the deserts or at sea; whether they partake in the Hajj pilgrimage or not; whether they import things; whether they do business with men (a.s.ell or buy); and whether they are dealers or needy men. It also includes the fulfillment of the needs of the people who live in that vicinity where the Hajj pilgrims gather together as God has said, ‘That they may witness the benefits (provided) for them.’And the reason behind the obligation of going on the Hajj pilgrimage once (in the lifetime) is that the Honorable the Exalted God has considered the least powerful of the people in establishing the obligatory deeds (they only need to go once). One of these obligations is the Hajj pilgrimage which is obligatory once. God has encouraged the powerful people to go as often as they can.And the reason behind establishing the House (of God) in the middle of the Earth is that it is the place where land at first came out of water. All the winds that blow in the world start from there at the point beneath the ‘al-Rokn ash-Shami. The House of God was the first mausoleum established on the Earth. Therefore, it is the center and the religiouspilgrimage obligation for all the people whether they are from the East or the West. Mecca was so named because the people used to whistle there, and they called whoever intended to go there as he whistled. This is clear from the Words of the Honorable the Exalted God, ‘Their prayer at the House (of God) is nothing but whistling and clapping of hands…’ Here the word ‘Mecca used in the verse in Arabic means whistling and the word ‘Tasdiyah used in the verse in Arabic means clapping.And the reason behind the circumambulation around the House (of God) is that the Blessed the Sublime God told the angels, ‘I will create a vicegerent on earth.’ They said, ‘Wilt Thou place therein one who will make mischief therein and shed blood?…’ They gave this reply to the Sublime God, but then they became sorry, took refuge in the Throne and repented. The Honorable the Exalted God desired that other servants worship in a similar fashion just like the angels. Therefore, He founded a House parallel to the Throne in the Fourth Heaven called ‘Az-Zorah. Then He founded another House in the Heavens of this world parallel to ‘Az-Zorah called ‘Al-Bayt al-Ma’mur. Then He founded this House parallel to ‘Al-Bayt al-Ma’mur. Then He ordered Adam to circumambulate around it. Then the Honorable the Exalted God forgave him and this became a practice for his progeny all the way up until the Resurrection Day.And the reason behind kissing or touching the Black Stone is that when the Blessed the Sublime God made a covenant with the children of Adam, the Black Stone swallowed it and thus made the people obliged to honor this covenant. That is near the Black Stone they must say, ‘This is what I was entrusted with and I fulfilled it. This is my covenant and I honored it. Therefore, bear witness that I honored my covenant.’ The same meaning lies in Salman’s words, ‘On the Resurrection Day the Black Stone will appear like Mount Abi Qays with a tongue. It will testify on behalf of whoever has visited it.’And the reason behind naming Mina (meaning beg) is that Gabriel descended to Abraham and said, ‘Beg your Lord for something.’ Then Abraham asked that God establish the offering of a sheep instead of offering his son Ishmael, and God order that the sheep be slaughtered for Him. Then this request was granted.And the reason behind fasting is the realization of the feeling of hunger and thirst that one would suffer if he was poor. Another reason is to suffer and be patient (during fasting so as to receive rewards, and to act as proofs of the Hereafter’s hardships. In addition to all of this, fasting is a cause of elimination of lust and acts as an advisor for us, and as a proof for the Hereafter to see its hardships. Fasting also makes us realize the extent of hardships suffered by the poor and the indigent in this world and the Hereafter.And God forbade killing since its allowance would corrupt the society, cause its destruction and the corruption of His Plan.And the Honorable the Exalted God forbade doing what might result in parents’ damnation (of us) is that this would involve the disobedience of the Honorable the Exalted God and our parents; an approach to the denial of blessings; cancellation of gratitude and what might lead to the cutting off of and the disruption of family ties. This is because it involves not paying enough respect for parents, recognizing their rights; the cutting off of family ties; the lack of the inclination of parents to see their children, and quitting to upbring them since the parents no longer have any hopes in their well-being.And God forbade adultery due to the corruption it results in, including murders, the disruption of family relations, the abandoning of the proper raising of children, corruption in inheritance issues and other similar forms of corruption.And God forbade oppressively devouring the orphan’s property due to several corrupting reasons. Firstly, when man oppressively devours an orphan’s property he has indeed acted as a partner in murdering the orphan, since an orphan is not self-sufficient and cannot maintain himself. He cannot support himself, and he has no one else to support him and maintain him as his parents would have done. Therefore, if someone devours his property, it is as if he has killed the orphan by leading him into poverty and destitution, even though the Honorable the Exalted God has admonished us against this act. And He has established its punishment in the following Words of the Honorable the Exalted God, ‘Let those (disposing of an estate) have the same fear in their minds as they would have for their own, if they had left a helpless family behind: Let them fear God…’”Abi Ja’far (al-Baqir) said, “The Honorable the Exalted God has promised two punishments for devouring the orphan’s property: punishments in this world and punishment in the Hereafter. The reason for the forbiddance of devouring the orphan’s property is to maintain the orphan until he attains his independence and does not need other people’s property. It is also meant to safeguard the survivors of the orphan’s guardian, so that they do not have to suffer the same thing that the orphan suffers by experiencing the punishment that God has promised for this world. Also the orphan will demand his property when he grows up. Then it will result in such hatred, animosity and wrath that it will finally end up in the destruction of them all.And God forbade fleeing from the battle-field since it will weaken the religion, undermine the Prophethood and the just Immaculate Leaders , and not help them against their enemies. This will result in punishment as it equates to denying what the Prophet (S) and the Imams invite us to including the confession to His Lordship; expression of social justice; elimination of oppression; destruction of corruption and whatever might happen due to the enemy getting daring with the Muslims, and its consequences such as killing, destroying the Honorable the Exalted God’s religion and any other corruption.And God forbade adopting Arab customs after the migration, since it implies returning from the religion, abandoning the assistance to the Prophets and the Proofs , and other corruption that it will lead to. It would also imply the cancellation of all the rights of those who have some rights. This would be similar to living like the Bedouins. Since if one recognizes the religion perfectly then he would not associate with the ignorant ones and would fear them. Should one associate with the ignorant ones, he would not be immune from slowly abandoning his own knowledge and become ignorant - even more ignorant than the ignorant.And God forbade whatever has been slaughtered in a name other than God’s. The Honorable the Exalted God has made it incumbent for His creatures to bear witness to Him, mention His Name over whatever (animals) they slaughter to make them allowable to eat, and as a way to make a distinction between what is done to get nearer to Him and what establishes the worship of the Satans. There lies a confession to His Lordship and Unity in mentioning the Name of the Honorable theExalted, and there lies atheism and seeking to approach other deities in mentioning any other names (while slaughtering). Therefore, remembering God and mentioning His Name over what is slaughtered is what would make a distinction between what God has allowed and what He has forbidden to eat.And God forbade eating wild birds and beasts of prey since they all feed on the dead animals, human corpses and human waste and the like. Then the Honorable, the Exalted God has established some signs in the wild animals and birds, so that those we are allowed to eat can be distinguishable from those that are forbidden to eat. My father said, “Any wild animals that have canine teeth and any birds that have claws are forbidden to eat. Any birds that have gizzards are allowable to eat.”Another sign to distinguish between birds which we are allowed to eat and birds which are forbidden to eat is that my father said, “Eat whichever of the birds that constantly flap their wings while flying, and do not eat any of the birds that sometimes flap their wings but mostly glide.”And God forbade eating rabbits as it has claws like cats and other beasts of prey. Therefore, the same decree about beasts of prey applies to eating rabbits. In addition to this, there is some filthiness in it and bleeding like that of menstruating women since it is a freak (perverted) animal.And the reason behind the forbiddance of usury is that God has admonished against it, because in it there lies the destruction of property. When man buys one Dirham for two Dirhams while the worth of one Dirham is only one Dirham, the second Dirham has become destroyed. Thus usury on transaction is a loss under all circumstances for the buyer and the seller. Thus the Blessed the Sublime God forbade usury due to its effect on destroying property as He has admonished against letting a fool have any control over his own property, since there is the fear that he might destroy it. This holds until he matures intellectually. Thus this is the reason God has forbidden usury, and the purchase of one Dirham in exchange for two Dirhams.And the reason behind the forbiddance of usury after the decree on it became clear is that practicing usury implies the underestimation of what God has forbidden. That is committing a major sin after it has been clarified. The Sublime God has forbidden it. This is nothing but an underestimation of the forbiddance of what is forbidden, and such an underestimation equals becoming an atheist.And the reason behind the forbiddance of usury on loan is that doing good deeds will disappear, and property will be destroyed. The people will be inclined to gain a benefit without exerting any effort. The payment of loans will be abandoned while it is one of the good deeds. In this there is corruption, oppression and the destruction of property.And God forbade eating pork as a pig is ugly. The Honorable the Exalted God has set it as a lesson to take heed of for the people, and as a scare crow and a reason to see what a freak it is for His creatures. It is also because its food is the most contaminated - plus many more reasons.God also forbade eating monkeys as they are freaks like pigs. He has set it as a lesson to take heed of for the people, and as a scare crow and a reason to see what a freak is for His creatures. Also about the monkey’s face, God established it like man to be a proof for man that it is one of the creatures upon which there was God’s Wrath.And God forbade eating whatever is dead due to the existence of things in them which would corrupt the body and would cause calamities (a.s.erious diseases). The Honorable the Exalted God willed to establish the mentioning of His Name to be the cause for the allowance of eating the animals and that this act be what distinguishes between the allowed and the forbidden to eat.And the Honorable the Exalted God forbade eating blood as He forbade eating the dead due to the existence of things in them which would corrupt the body and would cause bile, bad breath, bad body odor, bad temper, getting mean, lack of kindness and mercy so much that one might even kill his own father or friend.And God forbade eating a spleen since there is blood in it. The reason for this is the same as the reason for the forbiddance of eating blood and the dead as both are in the same direction of corruption.And the reason behind the nuptial gift and its obligation for men, and not upon the women to give to the men is that the expenses of the woman are on the man’s shoulders. The woman is selling herself and the man is the buyer. There is no selling without a cost and no buying without a payment, even though women are excused from doing business and trade due to many reasons.And the reason behind the allowance of men to marry up to four women and the forbidding of women to marry more than one man, is that if a man has four wives, his children are associated with him. However, if a woman has two or more husbands, they cannot tell who the child belongs to since all the husbands equally sleep with her. This will result in the disruption of family ties, inheritance and the recognition of the father-children relations.And the reason behind the limit of two wives for a slave is that he is like half of a free man in both divorce and marriage. He does not have possession of himself. He cannot own any property. Even his own expenses are paid by his master. This is so that there be a difference between him and a free man. And the other reason for this is that he be less involved and pay more attention to the affairs of his master.And the reason behind allowing (a man to divorce his wife) a maximum of three times (before a woman must marry someone else before she can be remarried to) is that there is a chance in between each divorce for the man to get attracted to her again, and his anger lessen. This is also to serve as an admonishment and a way of making the women behave and not disobey their husbands. If not so, she will deserve to be separated from her husband since she has done what she should not have done - being disobedient to her husband.And the reason behind the forbiddance of a man from ever again marrying a woman after he has divorced her nine times is to serve as a punishment for him not to take divorce lightly, not to consider the women to be weak, to carefully watch over his affairs and to know that there are no hopes for reunion with her after divorcing her for nine times.And the reason behind the limitation of divorcing those owned by your right hand only two times, is that the divorcing of slave maids is considered to be half of that of divorcing free women. Therefore, God has established a limit of two times as a precaution in order to perfect the decrees. The same rule holds for the waiting period when their husbands die.And the reason behind not accepting the witnessing of women in cases of divorce and seeing the moon, is due to their weakness of sight, and their friendship with other women. That is why their witnessing is not allowedexcept in cases of necessity like the case of taking a midwife as a witness, or cases where men are not allowed to look. This is similar to the case of the People of the Book, when we cannot find anyone else to bear witness as we read in the Honorable the Exalted God’s Book, ‘…two just men of your own (brotherhood)’ from the Muslims ‘or others from outside…’ from the pagans. It is also similar to the witnessing of immature children in cases of murder when there are no other witnesses.And the reason behind the requirement of four witnesses to adultery and only two for other crimes is the severity of the punishment for adultery, since there is the punishment of execution for it. Therefore, He established double witness requirements for it, since it involves the killing of the people, the disruption of the relationship between fathers and children, and causes inheritance problems.And the reason behind the allowance of children’s property for their father without requiring any permission from them, and the forbiddance of the property of the father for the children without his permission is that the children themselves are born of their father. The Honorable the Exalted God said, “…He bestows (children) male or female according to His Will (and Plan).” Also the children get their sustenance from their father, whether they are small or have grown up. They are associated with him and they are called and are known by his name. The Honorable the Exalted God said, ‘Call them by (the names of) their fathers: that is juster in the sight of God…’ Also the Prophet (S) said, “You and your possessions all belong to your father.” However, the mother’s case is not the same. That is she cannot take her children’s possessions without the permission of her children or their father’s permission, since the father is the one who pays for the children’s living expenses, while the mother does not have to pay for their living expenses.And the reason why the claiming side has to provide the reasoning and the claimant has to swear (by the Qur’an) in all cases, except for bloodshed, is that the claimant cannot provide any proof for his case since he does not know anything. Thus, he has to swear that he is innocent. However, in case of bloodshed, the claimant’s side must provide the reasoning and the claiming side must swear to his claim. This is to prevent undue bloodshed of Muslims and also prevents any torture. In addition, there are usually few to swear that someone has committed murder, so it is very hard for the claimant to provide reasoning.And the reason behind swearing (by the Qur’an) - that is fifty men should swear - is to make it harder and to be more cautious about shedding undue blood.And the reason behind chopping off the right hand of a thief is that he engages in the act of robbery using his right hand which is the noblest human part, and is the most useful one. Therefore, God has established chopping it off as a punishment and as a lesson for others to take heed of and not obtain any property in ways other than what is legitimate. Also most thefts are carried out using the right hand. God also abandoned the forceful seizure of property and obtaining it through ways other than the allowed ways, since there is a lot of corruption in that. It is forbidden since corruption is the main cause of destruction, etc.And God forbade robbery because it would have caused corruption in property and killing people were it allowed. It would also lead to killing, fighting and jealousy due to unlawful seizure. Were it allowed, it would lead to the abandonment of business and work, and everyone would be equally entitled to everything.And the reason behind beating the body of an adulterer hard is that he or she has engaged his or her body in adultery and all of his or her body has derived pleasure. Beating the body is its punishment, and as a lesson for them to take heed of and know that this is one of the greatest crimes.And the reason behind the punishment of eighty lashes for malicious accusation (qadhf) or drinking wine is that there lies the denial of relations, killing and breakage of family ties in malicious accusations. One who drinks wine will hallucinate when he gets drunk and will make false accusations. Therefore, he also deserves to be punished for malicious accusations.And the reason behind killing an adulterer or adulteress after the execution of the Divine Punishment three times, is that he or she has underestimated and paid so little attention to the punishment of lashes that he or she considers himself or herself to be free to do this deed. Another reason behind this is that whoever underestimates God and the Divine Punishment is an atheist. Thus it becomes incumbent to kill him or her for becoming an atheist.And the reason behind the forbiddance of men for men (being gay) and women for women (being lesbian) is the nature of women and man’s natural inclination to women. In the case of gay and lesbian relationships between men with men, and women with women there will be a break in the generations, corruption of the natural order and the world’s destruction.And the Honorable the Exalted God allowed eating cow’s meat, sheep’s meat and camel’s meat due to their abundance, and their availability. The reason for the allowance of eating wild cows and others similar animals is that they eat allowable foods which are not harmful for them or men, and not eat abominable or forbidden foods. They are also not created to be ugly.And the reason why God has made it abominable to eat mules and domesticated asses is that the people need them to ride on and for carrying loads. There is a fear that they would become so scarce that they become extinct. It is not due to them being created ugly or eating bad things.And God forbade looking at women’s hair who are in bonds of marriage to their husbands and also other women, since that would sexually arouse a man, and this sexual arousal would lead him into corruption and partaking of what is not proper or allowed. The same thing holds for other things like their hair which they must cover up except for what the Sublime God has allowed in the following verse, ‘Such elderly women as are past the prospect of marriage, there is no blame on them if they lay aside their (outer) garments, provided they make not a wanton display of their beauty…’ meaning other than their garments. Then there is no problem with looking at their hair.And the reason behind the female share of inheritance being half of the male share is that when women marry they take something, but when men marry they have to give something. That is why the male share has been set to be more. Another reason behind the male share being double that of a female share of inheritance is that women are maintained by men. When they need something, the men have to provide for their needs. Such a responsibility does not lie on women regarding the protection and maintenance of men. Men cannot take any expenses from their women. Therefore the Sublime God has established a larger sharefor men. These are the Honorable the Exalted God’s words, ‘Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because God has given the one more (a.s.trength) than the other, and because they support them from their means…’And the reason behind a wife not inheriting from her husband’s land, except for the price of the building on it, is that the land cannot be divided. Nor can the land be moved from its place to another place. A woman is allowed to leave and cut off relationships from the family. She is allowed to change her husband, but no such possibility exists for the father and the children since their ties cannot be broken. Therefore, the inheritance for the relationship which can be broken, moved or exchanged is only from what can be moved, since they are of a similar nature. And the inheritance for the relationship that is stable and cannot be broken is from what is similarly stable and fixed."

Wine changes the intellect of the one who drinks it. It will drive him to deny the Honorable the Exalted God. It will result in him ascribing false accusations to Him and His Messengers. There is also other corruption in it like killing, malicious accusations, adultery, and not avoiding other forbidden things. That is why any intoxicating drink has also been forbidden, since it has the same effects as wine does. Therefore, anyone who believes in God, the Final Day, our Mastery (of the Imams), or claims our friendship should avoid any intoxicating drinks. There will be no relations between us and those who drink!”"

مُؤَدِّياً لِمَا أَقَرَّ بِهِ يُظْهِرُ الإِسْلامَ وَالْمُرَاقَبَةَ وَلِتَكُونَ شَهَادَاتُ النَّاسِ بِالإِسْلامِ بَعْضِهِمْ لِبَعْضٍ جَائِزَةً مُمْكِنَةً مَعَ مَا فِيهِ مِنَ الْمُسَاعَدَةِ عَلَى الْبِرِّ وَالتَّقْوَى وَالزَّجْرِ عَنْ كَثِيرٍ مِنْ مَعَاصِي اللَّهِ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ جُعِلَ الْجَهْرُ فِي بَعْضِ الصَّلاةِ وَلَمْ يُجْعَلْ فِي بَعْضٍ قِيلَ لانَّ الصَّلَوَاتِ الَّتِي يُجْهَرُ فِيهَا إِنَّمَا هِيَ صَلَوَاتٌ تُصَلَّى فِي أَوْقَاتٍ مُظْلِمَةٍ فَوَجَبَ أَنْ يُجْهَرَ فِيهَا لانْ يَمُرَّ الْمَارُّ فَيَعْلَمَ أَنَّ هَاهُنَا جَمَاعَةً فَإِنْ أَرَادَ أَنْ يُصَلِّيَ صَلَّى وَلانَّهُ إِنْ لَمْ يَرَ جَمَاعَةً تُصَلِّي سَمِعَ وَعَلِمَ ذَلِكَ مِنْ جِهَةِ السَّمَاعِ وَالصَّلاتَانِ اللَّتَانِ لا يُجْهَرُ فِيهِمَا فَإِنَّهُمَا بِالنَّهَارِ وَفِي أَوْقَاتٍ مُضِيئَةٍ فَهِيَ تُدْرَكُ مِنْ جِهَةِ الرُّؤْيَةِ فَلا يَحْتَاجُ فِيهَا إِلَى السَّمَاعِ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ جُعِلَتِ الصَّلَوَاتُ فِي هَذِهِ الأَوْقَاتِ وَلَمْ تُقَدَّمْ وَلَمْ تُؤَخَّرْ قِيلَ لانَّ الأَوْقَاتَ الْمَشْهُورَةَ الْمَعْلُومَةَ الَّتِي تَعُمُّ أَهْلَ الأَرْضِ فَيَعْرِفُهَا الْجَاهِلُ وَالْعَالِمُ أَرْبَعَةٌ غُرُوبُ الشَّمْسِ مَعْرُوفٌ تَجِبُ عِنْدَهُ الْمَغْرِبُ وَسُقُوطُ الشَّفَقِ مَشْهُورٌ تَجِبُ عِنْدَهُ الْعِشَاءُ الآْخِرَةُ وَطُلُوعُ الْفَجْرِ مَشْهُورٌ مَعْلُومٌ، تَجِبُ عِنْدَهُ الْغَدَاةُ، وَزَوَالُ الشَّمْسِ مَشْهُورٌ مَعْلُومٌ، تَجِبُ عِنْدَهُ الظُّهْرُوَلَمْ يَكُنْ لِلْعَصْرِ وَقْتٌ مَعْرُوفٌ مَشْهُورٌ مِثْلُ هَذِهِ الأَوْقَاتِ الأَرْبَعَةِ فَجُعِلَ وَقْتُهَا عِنْدَ الْفَرَاغِ مِنَ الصَّلاةِ الَّتِي قَبْلَهَا.وَعِلَّةٌ أُخْرَى أَنَّ اللَّهَ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ أَحَبَّ أَن يَبْدَأَ النَّاسُ فِي كُلِّ عَمَلٍ أَوَّلاً بِطَاعَتِهِ وَعِبَادَتِهِ فَأَمَرَهُمْ أَوَّلَ النَّهَارِ أَنْ يَبْدَءُوا بِعِبَادَتِهِ ثُمَّ يَنْتَشِرُوا فِيَما أَحَبُّوا مِنْ مَرَمَّةِ دُنْيَاهُمْ فَأَوْجَبَ صَلاةَ الْغَدَاةِ عَلَيْهِمْ فَإِذَا كَانَ نِصْفُ النَّهَارِ وَتَرَكُوا مَا كَانُوا فِيهِ مِنَ الشُّغُلِ وَهُوَوَقْتٌ يَضَعُ النَّاسُ فِيهِ ثِيَابَهُمْ وَيَسْتَرِيحُونَ وَيَشْتَغِلُونَ بِطَعَامِهِمْ وَقَيْلُولَتِهِمْ فَأَمَرَهُمْ أَنْ يَبْدَءُوا أَوَّلاً بِذِكْرِهِ وَعِبَادَتِهِ فَأَوْجَبَ عَلَيْهِمُ الظُّهْرَ ثُمَّ يَتَفَرَّغُوا لِمَا أَحَبُّوا مِنْ ذَلِكَ فَإِذَا قَضَوْا وَطَرَهُمْ وَأَرَادُوا الانْتِشَارَ فِي الْعَمَلِ لآِخِرِ النَّهَارِ بَدَءُوا أَيْضاً بِعِبَادَتِهِ ثُمَّ صَارُوا إِلَى مَا أَحَبُّوا مِنْ ذَلِكَ فَأَوْجَبَ عَلَيْهِمُ الْعَصْرَ ثُمَّ يَنْتَشِرُونَ فِيَما شَاءُوا مِنْ مَرَمَّةِ دُنْيَاهُمْ فَإِذَا جَاءَ اللَّيْلُ وَوَضَعُوا زِينَتَهُمْ وَعَادُوا إِلَى أَوْطَانِهِمْ ابْتَدَءُوا أَوَّلاً بِعِبَادَةِ رَبِّهِمْ ثُمَّ يَتَفَرَّغُونَ لِمَا أَحَبُّوا مِنْ ذَلِكَ فَأَوْجَبَ عَلَيْهِمُ الْمَغْرِبَ فَإِذَا جَاءَ وَقْتُ النَّوْمِ وَفَرَغُوا مِمَّا كَانُوا بِهِ مُشْتَغِلِينَ أَحَبَّ أَنْ يَبْدَءُوا أَوَّلاً بِعِبَادَتِهِ وَطَاعَتِهِ ثُمَّ يَصِيرُونَ إِلَى مَا شَاءُوا أَنْ يَصِيرُوا إِلَيْهِ مِنْ ذَلِكَ فَيَكُونُوا قَدْ بَدَءُوا فِي كُلِّ عَمَلٍ بِطَاعَتِهِ وَعِبَادَتِهِ فَأَوْجَبَ عَلَيْهِمُ الْعَتَمَةَ فَإِذَا فَعَلُوا ذَلِكَ لَمْ يَنْسَوْهُ وَلَمْ يَغْفُلُوا عَنْهُ وَلَمْ تَقْسُ قُلُوبُهُمْ وَلَمْ تَقِلَّ رَغْبَتُهُمْ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ إِذَا لَمْ يَكُنْ لِلْعَصْرِ وَقْتٌ مَشْهُورٌ مِثْلُ تِلْكَ الأَوْقَاتِ أَوْجَبَهَا بَيْنَ الظُّهْرِ وَالْمَغْرِبِ وَلَمْ يُوجِبْهَا بَيْنَ الْعَتَمَةِ وَالْغَدَاةِ أَوْ بَيْنَ الْغَدَاةِ وَالظُّهْرِ قِيلَ لانَّهُ لَيْسَ وَقْتٌ عَلَى النَّاسِ أَخَفَّ وَلا أَيْسَرَ وَلا أَحْرَى أَنْ يَعُمَّ فِيهِ الضَّعِيفَ وَالْقَوِيَّ بِهَذِهِ الصَّلاةِ مِنْ هَذَا الْوَقْتِ وَذَلِكَ أَنَّ النَّاسَ عَامَّتَهُمْ يَشْتَغِلُونَ فِي أَوَّلِ النَّهَارِ بِالتِّجَارَاتِ وَالْمُعَامَلاتِ وَالذَّهَابِ فِي الْحَوَائِجِ وَإِقَامَةِ الأَسْوَاقِ فَأَرَادَ أَنْ لا يَشْغَلَهُمْ عَنْ طَلَبِ مَعَاشِهِمْ وَمَصْلَحَةِ دُنْيَاهُمْ.وَلَيْسَ يَقْدِرُ الْخَلْقُ كُلُّهُمْ عَلَى قِيَامِ اللَّيْلِ وَلا يَشْعُرُونَ بِهِ وَلا يَنْتَبِهُونَ لِوَقْتِهِ لَوْ كَانَ وَاجِباًوَلا يُمْكِنُهُمْ ذَلِكَ فَخَفَّفَ اللَّهُ تَعَالَى عَنْهُمْ وَلَمْ يَجْعَلْهَا فِي أَشَدِّ الأَوْقَاتِ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَكِنْ جَعَلَهَا فِي أَخَفِّ الأَوْقَاتِ عَلَيْهِمْ كَمَا قَالَ اللَّهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ يُرِيدُ اللَّهُ بِكُمُ الْيُسْرَ وَلا يُرِيدُ بِكُمُ الْعُسْر.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ يُرْفَعُ الْيَدَانِ فِي التَّكْبِيرِ قِيلَ لانَّ رَفْعَ الْيَدَيْنِ هُوَضَرْبٌ مِنَ الابْتِهَالِ وَالتَّبَتُّلِ وَالتَّضَرُّعِ فَأَوْجَبَ اللَّهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ أَنْ يَكُونَ الْعَبْدُ فِي وَقْتِ ذِكْرِهِ مُتَبَتِّلاً مُتَضَرِّعاً مُبْتَهِلاً وَلانَّ فِي وَقْتِ رَفْعِ الْيَدَيْنِ إِحْضَارَ النِّيَّةِ وَإِقْبَالَ الْقَلْبِ عَلَى مَا قَالَ وَقَصَدَ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ جُعِلَ صَلاةُ السُّنَّةِ أَرْبَعاً وَثَلاثِينَ رَكْعَةً قِيلَ لانَّ الْفَرِيضَةَ سَبْعَ عَشْرَةَ رَكْعَةً فَجُعِلَتِ السُّنَّةُ مِثْلَيِ الْفَرِيضَةِ كَمَالاً لِلْفَرِيضَةِ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ جُعِلَ صَلاةُ السُّنَّةِ فِي أَوْقَاتٍ مُخْتَلِفَةٍ وَلَمْ تُجْعَلْ فِي وَقْتٍ وَاحِدٍ قِيلَ لانَّ أَفْضَلَ الأَوْقَاتِ ثَلاثَةٌ عِنْدَ زَوَالِ الشَّمْسِ وَبَعْدَ الْمَغْرِبِ وَبِالأَسْحَارِ فَأَحَبَّ أَنْ يُصَلَّى لَهُ فِي كُلِّ هَذِهِ الأَوْقَاتِ الثَّلاثَةِ لانَّهُ إِذَا فُرِّقَتِ السُّنَّةُ فِي أَوْقَاتٍ شَتَّى كَانَ أَدَاؤُهَا أَيْسَرَ وَأَخَفَّ مِنْ أَنْ تُجْمَعَ كُلُّهَا فِي وَقْتٍ وَاحِدٍ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ صَارَتْ صَلاةُ الْجُمُعَةِ إِذَا كَانَتْ مَعَ الإِمَامِ رَكْعَتَيْنِ وَإِذَا كَانَتْ بِغَيْرِ إِمَامٍ رَكْعَتَيْنِ وَرَكْعَتَيْنِ قِيلَ لِعِلَلٍ شَتَّى مِنْهَا أَنَّ النَّاسَ يَتَخَطَّوْنَ إِلَى الْجُمُعَةِ مِنْ بُعْدٍ فَأَحَبَّ اللَّهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ أَنْ يُخَفِّفَ عَنْهُمْ لِمَوْضِعِ التَّعَبِ الَّذِي صَارُوا إِلَيْهِ.وَمِنْهَا أَنَّ الإِمَامَ يَحْبِسُهُمْ لِلْخُطْبَةِ وَهُمْ مُنْتَظِرُونَ لِلصَّلاةِ وَمَنِ انْتَظَرَ الصَّلاةَ فَهُوَفِي صَلاةٍ فِي حُكْمِ الَّتمَامِ.وَمِنْهَا أَنَّ الصَّلاةَ مَعَ الإِمَامِ أَتَمُّ وَأَكْمَلُ لِعِلْمِهِ وَفِقْهِهِ وَعَدْلِهِ وَفَضْلِهِ وَمِنْهَا أَنَّ الْجُمُعَةَ عِيدٌ وَصَلاةَ الْعِيدِ رَكْعَتَانِ وَلَمْ تُقْصَرْ لِمَكَانِ الْخُطْبَتَيْنِ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ جُعِلَتِ الْخُطْبَةُ قِيلَ لانَّ الْجُمُعَةَ مَشْهَدٌ عَامٌّ فَأَرَادَ أَنْ يَكُونَ الإِمَامُ سَبَباً لِمَوْعِظَتِهِمْ وَتَرْغِيبِهِمْ فِي الطَّاعَةِ وَتَرْهِيبِهِمْ مِن الْمَعْصِيَةِ وَتَوْفِيقِهِمْ عَلَى مَا أَرَادَ مِنْ مَصْلَحَةِ دِينِهِمْ وَدُنْيَاهُمْ وَيُخْبِرُهُمْ بِمَا وَرَدَ عَلَيْهِمْ مِنَ الآْفَاتِ وَمِنَ الأَهْوَالِ الَّتِي لَهُمْ فِيهَا الْمَضَرَّةُ وَالْمَنْفَعَةُ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ جُعِلَتْ خُطْبَتَيْنِ قِيلَ لانْ يَكُونَ وَاحِدَةٌ لِلثَّنَاءِ وَالَّتمْجِيدِ وَالتَّقْدِيسِ لِلَّهِ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ وَالأُخْرَى لِلْحَوَائِجِ وَالإِعْذَارِ وَالإِنْذَارِ وَالدُّعَاءِ وَمَا يُرِيدُ أَنْ يُعَلِّمَهُمْ مِنْ أَمْرِهِ وَنَهْيِهِ مَا فِيهِ الصَّلاحُ وَالْفَسَادُ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ جُعِلَتِ الْخُطْبَةُ يَوْمَ الْجُمُعَةِ قَبْلَ الصَّلاةِ وَجُعِلَتْ فِي الْعِيدَيْنِ بَعْدَ الصَّلاةِ قِيلَ لانَّ الْجُمُعَةَ أَمْرٌ دَائِمٌ وَتَكُونُ فِي الشَّهْرِ مِرَاراً وَفِي السَّنَةِ كَثِيراً فَإِذَا كَثُرَ ذَلِكَ عَلَى النَّاسِ مَلُّوا وَتَرَكُوا وَلَمْ يُقِيمُوا عَلَيْهِ وَتَفَرَّقُوا عَنْهُ فَجُعِلَتْ قَبْلَ الصَّلاةِ لِيُحْتَبَسُوا عَلَى الصَّلاةِ وَلا يَتَفَرَّقُوا وَلا يَذْهَبُوا وَأَمَّا الْعِيدَيْنِ فَإِنَّمَا هُوَفِي السَّنَةِ مَرَّتَيْنِ وَهُوَأَعْظَمُ مِنَ الْجُمُعَةِ وَالزِّحَامُ فِيهِ أَكْثَرُ وَالنَّاسُ فِيهِ أَرْغَبُ فَإِنْ تَفَرَّقَ بَعْضُ النَّاسِ بَقِيَ عَامَّتُهُمْ وَلَيْسَ هُوَبِكَثِيرٍ فَيَمَلُّوا وَيَسْتَخِفُّوا بِهِ.قالَ مُصَنِّفُ هذا الْكِتابرحمه الله: جاءَ هذا الخَبَرُ هكَذا وَالْخُطْبَتَانِ فِي الْجُمُعَةِ وَالْعِيدَيْنِ بَعْدَ الصَّلاةِ لانَّهُمَا بِمَنْزِلَةِ الرَّكْعَتَيْنِ الأُخْرَاوَيْنِ وَأَوَّلُ مَنْ قَدَّمَ الْخُطْبَتَيْنِ عُثَْمـانُ بْنُ عَفَّـانَلأنَّهُ لَمَّا أَحْدَثَ مَا أَحْدَثَ لَمْ يَكُنِ النَّاسُ يَقِفُونَ عَلَى خُطْبَتِهِ وَيَقُولُونَ: مَا نَصْنَعُ بِمَوَاعِظِهِ وَقَدْ أَحْدَثَ مَا أَحْدَثَ فَقَدَّمَ الْخُطْبَتَيْنِ لِيَقِفَ النَّاسُ انْتِظَاراً لِلصَّلاةِ فَلا يَتَفَرَّقُوا عَنْهُ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ وَجَبَتِ الْجُمُعَةُ عَلَى مَنْ يَكُونُ عَلَى فَرْسَخَيْنِ لا أَكْثَرَ مِنْ ذَلِك؟ قِيلَ لانَّ مَا يُقَصَّرُ فِيهِ الصَّلاةُ بَرِيدَانِ ذَاهِباً أَوْ بَرِيدٌ ذَاهِباً وَجَائِياً وَالْبَرِيدُ أَرْبَعَةُ فَرَاسِخَ فَوَجَبَتِ الْجُمُعَةُ عَلَى مَنْ هُوَعَلَى نِصْفِ الْبَرِيدِ الَّذِي يَجِبُ فِيهِ التَّقْصِيرُ وَذَلِكَ أَنَّهُ يَجِيءُ فَرْسَخَيْنِ وَيَذْهَبُ فَرْسَخَيْنِ فَذَلِكَ أَرْبَعَةُ فَرَاسِخَ وَهُوَنِصْفُ طَرِيقِ الْمُسَافِرِ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ زِيدَ فِي صَلاةِ السُّنَّةِ يَوْمَ الْجُمُعَةِ أَرْبَعُ رَكَعَاتٍ قِيلَ تَعْظِيماً لِذَلِكَ الْيَوْمِ وَتَفْرِقَةً بَيْنَهُ وَبَيْنَ سَائِرِ الأَيَّامِ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ قُصِّرَتِ الصَّلاةُ فِي السَّفَرِ قِيلَ لانَّ الصَّلاةَ الْمَفْرُوضَةَ أَوَّلاً إِنَّمَا هِيَ عَشْرُ رَكَعَاتٍ وَالسَّبْعُ إِنَّمَا زِيدَتْ فِيهَا بَعْدُ فَخَفَّفَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُ تِلْكَ الزِّيَادَةَ لِمَوْضِعِ سَفَرِهِ وَتَعَبِهِ وَنَصَبِهِ وَاشْتِغَالِهِ بِأَمْرِ نَفْسِهِ وَظَعْنِهِ وَإِقَامَتِهِ لِئَلا يَشْتَغِلَ عَمَّا لا بُدَّ لَهُ مِنْ مَعِيشَتِهِ رَحْمَةً مِنَ اللَّهِ تَعَالَى وَتَعَطُّفاً عَلَيْهِ إِلا صَلاةَ الْمَغْرِبِ فَإِنَّهَا لَمْ تُقَصَّرْ لانَّهَا صَلاةٌ مُقَصَّرَةٌ فِي الأَصْلِ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ يَجِبُ التَّقْصِيرُ فِي ثَمَانِيَةِ فَرَاسِخَ لا أَقَلَّ مِنْ ذَلِكَ وَلا أَكْثَرَ.قِيلَ لانَّ ثَمَانِيَةَ فَرَاسِخَ مَسِيرَةُ يَوْمٍ لِلْعَامَّةِ وَالْقَوَافِلِ وَالأَثْقَالِ فَوَجَبَ التَّقْصِيرُ فِي مَسِيرَةِ يَوْمٍ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ وَجَبَ التَّقْصِيرُ فِي مَسِيرَةِ يَوْمٍ قِيلَ لانَّهُ لَوْ لَمْ يَجِبْ فِي مَسِيرَةِ يَوْمٍ لَمَا وَجَبَ فِي مَسِيرَةِ سَنَةٍ وَذَلِكَ أَنَّ كُلَّ يَوْمٍ يَكُونُ بَعْدَ هَذَا الْيَوْمِ فَإِنَّمَا هُوَنَظِيرُ هَذَا الْيَوْمِ فَلَوْ لَمْ يَجِبْ فِي هَذَا الْيَوْمِ لَمَا وَجَبَ فِي نَظِيرِهِ إِذَا كَانَ نَظِيرُهُ مِثْلَهُ لا فَرْقَ بَيْنَهُمَا.فَإِنْ قَالَ قَدْ يَخْتَلِفُ السَّيْرُ فَلِمَ جَعَلْتَ أَنْتَ مَسِيرَةَ يَوْمٍ ثَمَانِيَةَ فَرَاسِخَ قِيلَ لانَّ ثَمَانِيَةَ فَرَاسِخَ هِيَ مَسِيرُ الْجِمَالِ وَالْقَوَافِلِ وَهُوَالسَّيْرُ الَّذِي يَسِيرُهُ الْجَمَّالُونَ وَالْمُكَارُون.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ تُرِكَ تَطَوُّعُ النَّهَارِ وَلا يُتْرَكُ تَطَوُّعُ اللَّيْلِ قِيلَ لانَّ كُلَّ صَلاةٍ لا تَقْصِيرَ فِيهَا فَلا تَقْصِيرَ فِي تَطَوُّعِهَا وَذَلِكَ أَنَّ الْمَغْرِبَ لا تَقْصِيرَ فِيهَا فَلا تَقْصِيرَ فِيَما بَعْدَهَا مِنَ التَّطَوُّعِ وَكَذَلِكَ الْغَدَاةُ لا تَقْصِيرَ فِيَما قَبْلَهَا مِنَ التَّطَوُّعِ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَمَا بَالُ الْعَتَمَةِ مُقَصَّرَةٌ وَلَيْسَ تُتْرَكُ رَكْعَتَاهَا قِيلَ إِنَّ تِلْكَ الرَّكْعَتَيْنِ لَيْسَتَا مِنَ الْخَمْسِينَ وَإِنَّمَا هِيَ زِيَادَةٌ فِي الْخَمْسِينَ تَطَوُّعاً لِيُتِمَّ بِهَا بَدَلَ كُلِّ رَكْعَةٍ مِنَ الْفَرِيضَةِ رَكْعَتَيْنِ مِنَ التطوّع.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ جَازَ لِلْمُسَافِرِ وَالْمَرِيضِ أَنْ يُصَلِّيَا صَلاةَ اللَّيْلِ فِي أَوَّلِ اللَّيْلِ قِيلَ لاشْتِغَالِهِوَضَعْفِهِ لِيُحْرِزَ صَلاتَهُ فَيَسْتَرِيحَ الْمَرِيضُ فِي وَقْتِ رَاحَتِهِ وَيَشْتَغِلَ الْمُسَافِرُ بِأَشْغَالِهِ وَارْتِحَالِهِ وَسَفَرِهِ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ أُمِرُوا بِالصَّلاةِ عَلَى الْمَيِّتِ قِيلَ لِيَشْفَعُوا لَهُ وَيَدْعُوا لَهُ بِالْمَغْفِرَةِ لانَّهُ لَمْ يَكُنْ فِي وَقْتٍ مِنَ الأَوْقَاتِ أَحْوَجَ إِلَى الشَّفَاعَةِ فِيهِ وَالطَّلَبِ وَالاسْتِغْفَارِ مِنْ تِلْكَ السَّاعَةِ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ جُعِلَتْ خَمْسُ تَكْبِيرَاتٍ دُونَ أَنْ يُكَبَّرَ أَرْبَعاً أَوْ سِتّاً قِيلَ إِنَّ الْخَمْسَ إِنَّمَا أُخِذَتْ مِنَ الْخَمْسِ الصَّلَوَاتِ فِي الْيَوْمِ وَاللَّيْلَةِ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ لَمْ يَكُنْ فِيهَا رُكُوعٌ وَسُجُودٌ قِيلَ لانَّهُ إِنَّمَا يُرِيدُ بِهَذِهِ الصَّلاةِ الشَّفَاعَةَ لِهَذَا الْعَبْدِ الَّذِي قَدْ تَخَلَّى مِمَّا خَلَّفَ وَاحْتَاجَ إِلَى مَا قَدَّم.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ أُمِرَ بِغُسْلِ الْمَيِّتِ قِيلَ لانَّهُ إِذَا مَاتَ كَانَ الْغَالِبُ عَلَيْهِ النَّجَاسَةَ وَالآْفَةَ وَالأَذَى فَأَحَبَّ أَنْ يَكُونَ طَاهِراً إِذَا بَاشَرَ أَهْلَ الطَّهَارَةِ مِنَ الْمَلائِكَةِ الَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُ وَيُمَاسُّونَهُ فِيَما بَيْنَهُمْ نَظِيفاً مُوَجَّهاً بِهِ إِلَى اللَّهِ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ وَلَيْسَ مِنْ مَيِّتٍ يَمُوتُ إِلا خَرَجَتْ مِنْهُ الْجَنَابَةُ فَلِذَلِكَ أَيْضاً وَجَبَ الْغُسْلُ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ أُمِرُوا بِكَفْنِ الْمَيِّتِ قِيلَ لِيَلْقَى رَبَّهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ طَاهِرَ الْجَسَدِ وَلِئَلا تَبْدُوَ عَوْرَتُهُلِمَنْ يَحْمِلُهُ وَيَدْفِنُهُ وَلِئَلا يَظْهَرَ النَّاسُ عَلَى بَعْضِ حَالِهِ وَقُبْحِ مَنْظَرِهِ وَلِئَلا يَقْسُوَالْقَلْبُ مِنْ كَثْرَةِ النَّظَرِ إِلَى مِثْلِ ذَلِكَ لِلْعَاهَةِ وَالْفَسَادِ وَلِيَكُونَ أَطْيَبَ لانْفُسِ الأَحْيَاءِ وَلِئَلا يُبْغِضَهُ حَمِيمٌ فَيُلْقِيَ ذِكْرَهُ وَمَوَدَّتَهُ فَلا يَحْفَظَهُ فِيَما خَلَّفَ وَأَوْصَاهُ وَأَمَرَ بِهِ وَاجباً كان او ندباً.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ أُمِرُوا بِدَفْنِهِ قِيلَ لِئَلا يَظْهَرَ النَّاسُ عَلَى فَسَادِ جَسَدِهِ وَقُبْحِ مَنْظَرِهِ وَتَغَيُّرِ رِيحِهِ وَلا يَتَأَذَّى بِهِ الأَحْيَاءُ بِرِيحِهِ وَبِمَا يَدْخُلُ عَلَيْهِ مِنَ الآْفَةِ وَالْفَسَادِ وَلِيَكُونَ مَسْتُوراً عَنِ الأَوْلِيَاءِ وَالأَعْدَاءِ فَلا يَشْمَتَ عَدُوٌّ وَلا يَحْزَنَ صِدِّيقٌ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ أُمِرَ مَنْ يَغْسِلُهُ بِالْغُسْلِ قِيلَ لِعِلَّةِ الطَّهَارَةِ مِمَّا أَصَابَهُ مِنْ نَضْحِ الْمَيِّتِ لانَّ الْمَيِّتَ إِذَا خَرَجَ مِنْهُ الرُّوحُ بَقِيَ مِنْهُ أَكْثَرُ آفَتِهِ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ لَمْ يَجِبِ الْغُسْلُ عَلَى مَنْ مَسَّ شَيْئاً مِنَ الأَمْوَاتِ غَيْرِ الإِنْسَانِ كَالطَّيْرِ وَالْبَهَائِمِ وَالسِّبَاعِ وَغَيْرِ ذَلِكَ قِيلَ لانَّ هَذِهِ الأَشْيَاءَ كُلَّهَا مُلَبَّسَةٌ رِيشاً وَصُوفاً وَشَعَراً وَوَبَراً وَهَذَا كُلُّهُ ذَكِيٌّ وَلا يَمُوتُ وَإِنَّمَا يُمَاسُّ مِنْهُ الشَّيْءُ الَّذِي هُوَذَكِيٌّ مِنَ الْحَيِّ وَالْمَيِّتِ. فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ جَوَّزْتُمُ الصَّلاةَ عَلَى الْمَيِّتِ بِغَيْرِ وُضُوءٍ قِيلَ لانَّهُ لَيْسَ فِيهَا رُكُوعٌ وَلا سُجُودٌ وَإِنَّمَا هِيَ دُعَاءٌ وَمَسْأَلَةٌ وَقَدْ يَجُوزُ أَنْ تَدْعُوَاللَّهَ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ وَتَسْأَلَهُ عَلَى أَيِّ حَالٍ كُنْتَ وَإِنَّمَا يَجِبُ الْوُضُوءُ فِي الصَّلاةِ الَّتِي فِيهَا رُكُوعٌ وَسُجُودٌ. فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ جَوَّزْتُمُ الصَّلاةَ عَلَيْهِ قَبْلَ الْمَغْرِبِ وَبَعْدَ الْفَجْرِ.قِيلَ لانَّ هَذِهِ الصَّلاةَ إِنَّمَا تَجِبُ فِي وَقْتِ الْحُضُورِ وَالْعِلَّةِ وَلَيْسَتْ هِيَ مُوَقَّتَةً كَسَائِرِ الصَّلَوَاتِ وَإِنَّمَا هِيَ صَلاةٌ تَجِبُ فِي وَقْتِ حُدُوثِ الْحَدَثِ لَيْسَ لِلإِنْسَانِ فِيهِ اخْتِيَارٌ وَإِنَّمَا هُوَحَقٌّ يُؤَدَّى وَجَائِزٌ أَنْ يُؤَدَّى الْحُقُوقُ فِي أَيِّ وَقْتٍ كَانَ إِذَا لَمْ يَكُنِ الْحَقُّ مُوَقَّتاً.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ جُعِلَتْ لِلْكُسُوفِ صَلاةٌ قِيلَ لانَّهُ آيَةٌ مِنْ آيَاتِ اللَّهِ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ لا يُدْرَى أَلِرَحْمَةٍ ظَهَرَتْ أَمْ لِعَذَابٍ فَأَحَبَّ النَّبِيُ صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَآلِهِ أَنْ تَفْزَعَ أُمَّتُهُ إِلَى خَالِقِهَا وَرَاحِمِهَا عِنْدَ ذَلِكَ لِيَصْرِفَ عَنْهُمْ شَرَّهَا وَيَقِيَهُمْ مَكْرُوهَهَا كَمَا صَرَفَ عَنْ قَوْمِ يُونُسَ حِينَ تَضَرَّعُوا إِلَى اللَّهِ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ جُعِلَتْ عَشْرَ رَكَعَاتٍ قِيلَ لانَّ الصَّلاةَ الَّتِي نَزَلَ فَرْضُهَا مِنَ السَّمَاءِ إِلَى الأَرْضِ أَوَّلاً فِي الْيَوْمِ وَاللَّيْلَةِ فَإِنَّمَا هِيَ عَشْرُ رَكَعَاتٍ فَجُمِعَتْ تِلْكَ الرَّكَعَاتُ هَاهُنَا وَإِنَّمَا جُعِلَ فِيهَا السُّجُودُ لانَّهُ لا يَكُونُ صَلاةٌ فِيهَا رُكُوعٌ إِلا وَفِيهَا سُجُودٌ وَلانْ يَخْتِمُوا صَلاتَهُمْ أَيْضاً بِالسُّجُودِ وَالْخُضُوعِ وَإِنَّمَا جُعِلَتْ أَرْبَعَ سَجَدَاتٍ لانَّ كُلَّ صَلاةٍ نَقَصَ سُجُودُهَا مِنْ أَرْبَعِ سَجَدَاتٍ لا تَكُونُ صَلاةً لانَّ أَقَلَّ الْفَرْضِ مِنَ السُّجُودِ فِي الصَّلاةِ لا يَكُونُ إِلا عَلَى أَرْبَعِ سَجَدَاتٍ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ لَمْ يُجْعَلْ بَدَلُ الرُّكُوعِ سُجُوداً قِيلَ لانَّ الصَّلاةَ قَائِماً أَفْضَلُ مِنَ الصَّلاةِ قَاعِداً وَلانَّ الْقَائِمَ يَرَى الْكُسُوفَ وَالانْجِلاءَ وَالسَّاجِدُ لا يَرَى.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ غُيِّرَتْ عَنْ أَصْلِ الصَّلاةِ الَّتِي افْتَرَضَهَا اللَّهُ قِيلَ لانَّهُ صَلَّى لِعِلَّة تَغَيُّرِ أَمْرٍ مِنَ الأُمُورِ وَهُوَالْكُسُوفُ فَلَمَّا تَغَيَّرَتِ الْعِلَّةُ تَغَيَّرَ الْمَعْلُولُ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ جُعِلَ يَوْمُ الْفِطْرِ الْعِيدَ قِيلَ لانْ يَكُونَ لِلْمُسْلِمِينَ مَجْمَعاً يَجْتَمِعُونَ فِيهِ وَيَبْرُزُونَ إِلَى اللَّهِ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ فَيَحْمَدُونَهُ عَلَى مَا مَنَّ عَلَيْهِمْ فَيَكُونَ يَوْمَ عِيدٍ وَيَوْمَ اجْتَِماعٍ وَيَوْمَ فِطْرٍ وَيَوْمَ زَكَاةٍ وَيَوْمَ رَغْبَةٍ وَيَوْمَ تَضَرُّعٍ وَلانَّهُ أَوَّلُ يَوْمٍ مِنَ السَّنَةِ يَحِلُّ فِيهِ الأَكْلُ وَالشُّرْبُ لانَّ أَوَّلَ شُهُورِ السَّنَةِ عِنْدَ أَهْلِ الْحَقِّ شَهْرُ رَمَضَانَ فَأَحَبَّ اللَّهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ أَنْ يَكُونَ لَهُمْ فِي ذَلِكَ الْيَوْمِ مَجْمَعٌ يَحْمَدُونَهُ فِيهِ وَيُقَدِّسُونَهُ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ جُعِلَ التَّكْبِيرُ فِيهَا أَكْثَرَ مِنْهُ فِي غَيْرِهَا مِنَ الصَّلَوَاتِ قِيلَ لانَّ التَّكْبِيرَ إِنَّمَا هُوَتَعْظِيمٌ لِلَّهِ وَتَمْجِيدٌ عَلَى مَا هَدَى وَعَافَى كَمَا قَالَ اللَّهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ وَلِتُكْمِلُوا الْعِدَّةَ وَلِتُكَبِّرُوا اللَّهَ عَلى ما هَداكُمْ وَلَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ جُعِلَ فِيهَا اثْنَتَا عَشْرَةَ تَكْبِيرَةً قِيلَ لانَّهُ يَكُونُ فِي رَكْعَتَيْنِ اثْنَتَا عَشْرَةَ تَكْبِيرَةً فَلِذَلِكَ جُعِلَ فِيهَا اثْنَتَا عَشْرَةَ تَكْبِيرَةً.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ جُعِلَ سَبْعٌ فِي الأُولَى وَخَمْسٌ فِي الآْخِرَةِ وَلَمْ يُسَوَبَيْنَهُمَا قِيلَ لانَّ السُّنَّةَ فِي صَلاةِ الْفَرِيضَةِ أَنْ يُسْتَفْتَحَ بِسَبْعِ تَكْبِيرَاتٍ فَلِذَلِكَ بُدِئَ هَاهُنَا بِسَبْعِ تَكْبِيرَاتٍ وَجُعِلَ فِي الثَّانِيَةِ خَمْسُ تَكْبِيرَاتٍ لانَّ التَّحْرِيمَ مِنَ التَّكْبِيرِ فِي الْيَوْمِ وَاللَّيْلَةِ خَمْسُ تَكْبِيرَاتٍ وَلِيَكُونَ التَّكْبِيرُ فِي الرَّكْعَتَيْنِ جَمِيعاً وَتْراً وَتْراً.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ أُمِرُوا بِالصَّوْمِ قِيلَ لِكَيْ يَعْرِفُوا أَلَمَ الْجُوعِ وَالْعَطَشِ فَيَسْتَدِلُّوا عَلَى فَقْرِ الآْخِرَةِ وَلِيَكُونَ الصَّائِمُ خَاشِعاً ذَلِيلاً مُسْتَكِيناً مَأْجُوراً مُحْتَسِباً عَارِفاً صَابِراً لِمَا أَصَابَهُ مِنَ الْجُوعِ وَالْعَطَشِ فَيَسْتَوْجِبَ الثَّوَابَ مَعَ مَا فِيهِ مِنَ الانْكِسَارِ عَنِ الشَّهَـوَاتِ وَلِيَكُونَ ذَلِـكَوَاعِظاً لَهُمْ فِي الْعَاجِلِ وَرَائِضاً لَهُمْ عَلَى أَدَاءِ مَا كَلَّفَهُمْ وَدَلِيلاً فِي الآْجِلِ وَلِيَعْرِفُوا شِدَّةَ مَبْلَغِ ذَلِكَ عَلَى أَهْلِ الْفَقْرِ وَالْمَسْكَنَةِ فِي الدُّنْيَا فَيُؤَدُّوا إِلَيْهِمْ مَا افْتَرَضَ اللَّهُ تَعَالَى لَهُمْ فِي أَمْوَالِهِمْ.فَإِنْ قَالَ لِمَ جُعِلَ الصَّوْمُ فِي شَهْرِ رَمَضَانَ خَاصَّةً دُونَ سَائِرِ الشُّهُورِ قِيلَ لانَّ شَهْرَ رَمَضَانَ هُوَالشَّهْرُ الَّذِي أَنْزَلَ اللَّهُ تَعَالَى فِيهِ الْقُرْآنَ وَفِيهِ فَرَّقَ بَيْنَ الْحَقِّ وَالْبَاطِلِ كَمَا قَالَ اللَّهُ تَعَالَى شَهْرُ رَمَضانَ الَّذِي أُنْزِلَ فِيهِ الْقُرْآنُ هُدىً لِلنَّاسِ وَبَيِّناتٍ مِنَ الْهُدى وَالْفُرْقانِ وَفِيهِ نُبِّىَ مُحَمَّدٌ صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَآلِهِ وَفِيهِ لَيْلَةُ الْقَدْرِ الَّتِي هِيَ خَيْرٌ مِنْ أَلْفِ شَهْرٍ وَفِيها يُفْرَقُ كُلُّ أَمْرٍ حَكِيمٍ وَهِيَ رَأْسُ السَّنَةِ يُقَدَّرُ فِيهَا مَا يَكُونُ فِي السَّنَةِ مِنْ خَيْرٍ أَوْ شَرٍّ أَوْ مَضَرَّةٍ أَوْ مَنْفَعَةٍ أَوْ رِزْقٍ أَوْ أَجَلٍ وَلِذَلِكَ سُمِّيَتْ لَيْلَةَ الْقَدْرِ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ أُمِرُوا بِصَوْمِ شَهْرِ رَمَضَانَ لا أَقَلَّ مِنْ ذَلِكَ وَلا أَكْثَرَ قِيلَ لانَّهُ قُوَّةُ الْعِبَادِ الَّتِي يُعَمُّ فِيهَا الْقَوِيُّ وَالضَّعِيفُ وَإِنَّمَا أَوْجَبَ اللَّهُ تَعَالَى الْفَرَائِضَ عَلَى أَغْلَبِ الأَشْيَاءِ وَأَعَمِّ الْقُوَى ثُمَّ رَخَّصَ لاهْلِ الضَّعْفِ وَرَغَّبَ أَهْلَ الْقُوَّةِ فِي الْفَضْلِ وَلَوْ كَانُوا يَصْلُحُونَ عَلَى أَقَلَّ مِنْ ذَلِكَ لَنَقَصَهُمْ وَلَوِ احْتَاجُوا إِلَى أَكْثَرَ مِنْ ذَلِكَ لَزَادَهُمْ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ إِذَا حَاضَتِ الْمَرْأَةُ لا تَصُومُ وَلا تُصَلِّي قِيلَ لانَّهَا فِي حَدِّ النَّجَاسَةِ فَأَحَبَّ أَنْ لا تَعْبُدَ إِلا طَاهِراً وَلانَّهُ لا صَوْمَ لِمَنْ لا صَلاةَ لَهُ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ صَارَتْ تَقْضِي الصِّيَامَ وَلا تَقْضِي الصَّلاةَ؟قِيلَ لِعِلَلٍ شَتَّى فَمِنْهَا أَنَّ الصِّيَامَ لا يَمْنَعُهَا مِنْ خِدْمَةِ نَفْسِهَا وَخِدْمَةِ زَوْجِهَا وَإِصْلاحِ بَيْتِهَا وَالْقِيَامِ بِأُمُورِهَا وَالاشْتِغَالِ بِمَرَمَّةِ مَعِيشَتِهَا وَالصَّلاةُ تَمْنَعُهَا مِنْ ذَلِكَ كُلِّهِ لانَّ الصَّلاةَ تَكُونُ فِي الْيَوْمِ وَاللَّيْلَةِ مِرَاراً فَلا تَقْوَى عَلَى ذَلِكَ وَالصَّوْمُ لَيْسَ كَذَلِكَ وَمِنْهَا أَنَّ الصَّلاةَ فِيهَا عَنَاءٌ وَتَعَبٌ وَاشْتِغَالُ الأَرْكَانِ وَلَيْسَ فِي الصَّوْمِ شَيْءٌ مِنْ ذَلِكَ وَإِنَّمَا هُوَالإِمْسَاكُ عَنِ الطَّعَامِ وَالشَّرَابِ وَلَيْسَ فِيهِ اشْتِغَالُ الأَرْكَانوَمِنْهَا أَنَّهُ لَيْسَ مِنْ وَقْتٍ يَجِيءُ إِلا تَجِبُ عَلَيْهَا فِيهِ صَلاةٌ جَدِيدَةٌ فِي يَوْمِهَا وَلَيْلَتِهَا وَلَيْسَ الصَّوْمُ كَذَلِكَ لانَّهُ لَيْسَ كُلَّمَا حَدَثَ يَوْمٌ وَجَبَ عَلَيْهَا الصَّوْمُ وَكُلَّمَا حَدَثَ وَقْتُ الصَّلاةِ وَجَبَ عَلَيْهَا الصَّلاةُ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ إِذَا مَرِضَ الرَّجُلُ أَوْ سَافَرَ فِي شَهْرِ رَمَضَانَ فَلَمْ يَخْرُجْ مِنْ سَفَرِهِ أَوْ لَمْ يُفِقْ مِنْ مَرَضِهِ حَتَّى يَدْخُلَ عَلَيْهِ شَهْرُ رَمَضَانٍ آخَرُ وَجَبَ عَلَيْهِ الْفِدَاءُ لِلأَوَّلِ وَسَقَطَ الْقَضَاءُ فَإِذَا أَفَاقَ بَيْنَهُمَا أَوْ أَقَامَ وَلَمْ يَقْضِهِ وَجَبَ عَلَيْهِ الْقَضَاءُ وَالْفِدَاءُ قِيلَ لانَّ ذَلِكَ الصَّوْمَ إِنَّمَا وَجَبَ عَلَيْهِ فِي تِلْكَ السَّنَةِ فِي ذَلِكَ الشَّهْرِ فَأَمَّا الَّذِي لَمْ يُفِقْ فَإِنَّهُ لَمَّا أَنْ مَرَّ عَلَيْهِ السَّنَةُ كُلُّهَا وَقَدْ غَلَبَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ فَلَمْ يَجْعَلْ لَهُ السَّبِيلَ إِلَى أَدَائِهِ سَقَطَ عَنْهُ وَكَذَلِكَ كُلُّ مَا غَلَبَ اللَّهُ تَعَالَى عَلَيْهِ مِثْلَ الْمُغْمَى الَّذِي يُغْمَى عَلَيْهِ يَوْماً وَلَيْلَةً فَلا يَجِبُ عَلَيْهِ قَضَاءُ الصَّلاةِ كَمَا قَالَ الصَّادِقُ a.sُ كُلُّ مَا غَلَبَ اللَّهُ عَلَى الْعَبْدِ فَهُوَ أَعْذَرُ لَهُ لانَّهُ دَخَلَ الشَّهْرَ وَهُوَ مَرِيضٌ فَلَمْ يَجِبْ عَلَيْهِ الصَّوْمُ فِي شَهْـرِهِ وَلا سَنَتِهِ لِلْمَرَضِ الَّذِي كَـانَ فِيهِ وَوَجَبَ عَلَيْهِالْفِدَاءُ لانَّهُ بِمَنْزِلَةِ مَنْ وَجَبَ عَلَيْهِ صَوْمٌ فَلَمْ يَسْتَطِعْ أَدَاءَهُ فَوَجَبَ عَلَيْهِ الْفِدَاءُ كَمَا قَالَ اللَّهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ فَصِيامُ شَهْرَيْنِ مُتَتابِعَيْنِ... فَمَنْ لَمْ يَسْتَطِعْ فَإِطْعامُ سِتِّينَ مِسْكِيناً وَكَمَا قَالَ اللَّهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ فَفِدْيَةٌ مِنْ صِيامٍ أَوْ صَدَقَةٍ أَوْ نُسُكٍ فَأَقَامَ الصَّدَقَةَ مَقَامَ الصِّيَامِ إِذَا عَسُرَ عَلَيْهِ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَإِنْ لَمْ يَسْتَطِعْ إِذْ ذَاكَ فَهُوَالآْنَ يَسْتَطِيعُ قِيلَ لَهُ لانَّهُ لَمَّا أَنْ دَخَلَ عَلَيْهِ شَهْرُ رَمَضَانٍ آخَرُ وَجَبَ عَلَيْهِ الْفِدَاءُ لِلْمَاضِي لانَّهُ كَانَ بِمَنْزِلَةِ مَنْ وَجَبَ عَلَيْهِ صَوْمٌ فِي كَفَّارَةٍ فَلَمْ يَسْتَطِعْهُ فَوَجَبَ عَلَيْهِ الْفِدَاءُ وَإِذَا وَجَبَ الْفِدَاءُ سَقَطَ الصَّوْمُ وَالصَّوْمُ سَاقِطٌ وَالْفِدَاءُ لازِمٌ فَإِنْ أَفَاقَ فِيَما بَيْنَهُمَا وَلَمْ يَصُمْهُ وَجَبَ عَلَيْهِ الْفِدَاءُ لِتَضْيِيعِهِ وَالصَّوْمُ لاسْتِطَاعَتِهِ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ جُعِلَ صَوْمُ السُّنَّةِ قِيلَ لِيَكْمُلَ بِهِ صَوْمُ الْفَرْضِ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ جُعِلَ فِي كُلِّ شَهْرٍ ثَلاثَةَ أَيَّامٍ وَفِي كُلِّ عَشَرَةِ أَيَّامٍ يَوْماً. قِيلَ لانَّ اللَّهَ تَبَارَكَ وَتَعَالَى يَقُولُ: مَنْ جاءَ بِالْحَسَنَةِ فَلَهُ عَشْرُ أَمْثالِها فَمَنْ صَامَ فِي كُلِّ عَشَرَةِ أَيَّامٍ يَوْماً فَكَأَنَّمَا صَامَ الدَّهْرَ كُلَّهُ كَمَا قَالَ سَلْمَانُ الْفَارِسِيُّ رَحْمَةُ اللَّهِ عَلَيْهِ صَوْمُ ثَلاثَةِ أَيَّامٍ فِي الشَّهْرِ صَوْمُ الدَّهْرِ كُلِّهِ فَمَنْ وَجَدَ شَيْئاً غَيْرَ الدَّهْرِ فَلْيَصُمْهُ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ جُعِلَ أَوَّلَ خَمِيسٍ مِنَ الْعَشْرِ الأَوَّلِ وَآخِرَ خَمِيسٍ مِنَ الْعَشْرِ الآْخِرِ وَأَرْبِعَاءَ فِي الْعَشْرِ الأَوْسَطِ.قِيلَ أَمَّا الْخَمِيسُ فَإِنَّهُ قَالَ الصَّادِقُ a.sُ يُعْرَضُ كُلَّ خَمِيسٍ أَعْمَالُ الْعِبَادِ إِلَى اللَّهِ فَأَحَبَّ أَنْ يُعْرَضَ عَمَلُ الْعَبْدِ عَلَى اللَّهِ تَعَالَى وَهُوَصَائِمٌ.فَإِنْ قَالَ فَلِمَ جُعِلَ آخِرَ خَمِيسٍ قِيلَ لانَّهُ إِذَا عُرِضَ عَمَلُ ثَمَانِيَةِ أَيَّامٍ وَالْعَبْدُ صَائِمٌ كَانَ أَشْرَفَ وَأَفْضَلَ مِنْ أَنْ يُعْرَضَ عَمَلُ يَوْمَيْنِ وَهُوَصَائِمٌ وَإِنَّمَا جُعِلَ أَرْبِعَاءُ فِي الْعَشْرِ الأَوْسَطِ لانَّ الصَّادِقَ a.sُ أَخْبَرَ أَنَّ اللَّهَ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ خَلَقَ النَّارَ فِي ذَلِكَ الْيَوْمِ وَفِيهِ أَهْلَكَ اللَّهُ الْقُرُونَ الأُولَى وَهُوَيَوْمُ نَحْسٍ مُسْتَمِرٍّ فَأَحَبَّ أَنْ يَدْفَعَ الْعَبْدُ عَنْ نَفْسِهِ نَحْسَ ذَلِكَ الْيَوْمِ

Sha’ban of the year 352 A.H.

Moreover, al-Hakim Abu Muhammad Ja’far ibn Nu’aym ibn Shathan - may God have Mercy upon him - quoted on the authority of his uncle Abi Abdullah Muhammad ibn Shathan, on the authority of Fadhl ibn Shathan:“ If someone asks, ‘Let me know if it is permissible for the Wise God to oblige His servants to do something without any reason or meaning.’He is told, ‘No. This is not permissible since He is Wise and He does not do frivolous or ignorant things."
ʿUyūn akhbār al-Riḍā,The Source of Traditions on Imam al-Riḍā,Volume 2,Shaykh Muḥammad b. ʿAlī al-Ṣaduq,Dr. Ali Peiravi,"ʿUyūn Akhbār al-Riḍā, also known as ʿUyūn al-Akhbār is a comprehensive Ḥadīth collection focusing on Imam al-Riḍā (as), which is compiled by the renowned Shīʿī scholar, al-Shaykh al-Ṣadūq. The work contains a plethora of Ḥadīths that are either the direct sayings of Imam al-Riḍā (as) or the wisdom he imparted from his forefathers. As one of the references within Shīʿī scholarship, this collection covers an array of subjects, including history, jurisprudence, ethics, and theology. al-Shaykh al-Ṣadūq may have written ʿUyūn Akhbār al-Riḍā after the death of Rukn al-Dawla al-Buwayhī in 366 AH. The writing of this work was inspired by a unique exchange. Sāḥib b. ʿAbbād al-Daylamī, a prominent Shīʿī minister and ruler of the time, penned a poem extolling ʿAlī b. Mūsā al-Riḍā (as) and dedicated it to al-Shaykh al-Ṣadūq. In response, the work was compiled as a reciprocal gift. al-Shaykh al-Ṣadūq stated in his introduction, ""I found no other better gift than this book which is about the infinite knowledge of Imam al-Riḍā (as) to send in return to the two odes of Ibn ʿAbbād.” This text provides readers with a deep understanding of the life and teachings of Imam al-Riḍā, illuminating the comprehensive scope of his wisdom and his contributions to Islamic thought and practice.",Section 1,Chapter 5 | On What Ar-Ridha Wrote for Al-Ma’mun Regarding Pure Islam and the Religious Decrees,Ḥadīth #1,1 - حَدَّثَنا

Ubdoos al-Neishaboori al-Attar - may God be pleased with him - narrated in the (Arabic) month of Sha’ban of the year 352 A.H. (962 A.D.) in Neishaboor that Ali ibn Muhammad ibn Qutayba al-Neishaboori quoted on the authority of Al-Fadhl ibn Shathan that Al-Ma’mun asked Ali ibn Musa Ar-Ridha’ to write a brief account of the pure Islam for him. Then he wrote, “In pure Islam it suffices to confess that there is no god but God the One for Whom there exists no partner; the Only God; the One and Only; the Eternal; the Self-Existent; the All-Hearing; the All-Seeing; the All-Powerful; the Ever-Existing; the Ever-Lasting; the All-Knowing for Whom there is no ignorance; the All-Powerful for Whom there is no incapability; the All-Sufficient for Whom there is no need; the All-Just for Whom there is no wrong. He is the One who created everything. There is nothing like Him. There is no one similar to Him. There is no one opposed to Him. There is no one equal to Him. He is the subject of all worshipping, supplications, desires and fears.And that Muhammad is His Servant, Messenger, Trustee, and Appointee among His creatures. He is the Master of the Messengers, the Seal of the Prophets, and the Noblest of the people of the Two Worlds. There are no Prophets after him and there will be no changes in his Islamic Laws.And that everything with which Muhammad ibn Abdullah (the Prophet) came is the evident Right. We believe in him as well as all the Messengers, Prophets, and Proofs of God that preceded him. We believe in his Truthful Book in which it is stated, ‘No falsehood can approach it from before or behind it: It is sent down by One Full of Wisdom, Worthy of all Praise.’And that his Book supercedes all of the other Divine Books. It is correct from the beginning up to the end. We believe in all its verses whether they are decisive, allegorical, particular, general, promising, threatening, repealing, repealed, or express news. No creature can ever create its equivalent.Moreover, the evidence for the believers after the Prophet (S), the manager of the affairs of the Muslims, the spokesman of the Qur’an, the knower of its decrees is his brother, successor, and Trustee - Ali bin Abi Talib . His position relative to Muhammad is the same as that of Aaron’s position relative to Moses . He is the Commander of the Faithful Believers, the Leader of the God-Fearing ones, the Leader of the lustrous ones, the best of the Trustees of the Prophet (S) and the inheritor of the Knowledge of the Prophets and the Messengers .After him comes Al-Hassan and Al-Husayn - the Masters of the Youth in Heaven. Then there is Ali ibn Al-Husayn - the adornment of the worshippers. Then there is Muhammad ibn Ali - the analyser of the Knowledge of the Prophets. Then there is Ja’far ibn Muhammad As-Sadiq - the inheritor of the Knowledge of the Trustees. Then there is Musa ibn Ja’far Al-Kadhim . Then there is Ali ibn Musa Ar-Ridha’ . Then there is Muhammad ibn Ali . Then there is Ali ibn Muhammad . Then there is Al-Hassan ibn Ali . Then there is His Proof - the Riser; the Awaited One. May God’s Blessings be upon them all. I bear witness to their Trusteeship and Divine Leadership. And the Earth will never be left without the Sublime God’s Proof for His creatures present. They are the Reliable Grip, the Leaders towards guidance, and proofs for the people of the world for as long as the Earth and whatever is on it lasts.Anyone who opposes them (the imams) is deviant, misleading, and the deserter of the Truth and Guidance. The Imams are the interpreters of the Qur’an and the spokespersons of the Prophet (S) with explanations. Whoever dies without acknowledging them has died as one who died during the Age of Ignorance.Piety, chastity, honesty, goodness, perseverance, diligence, returning what we are entrusted with to either the pious or wicked persons, extended prostration (to God), fasting in daytime, worshipping at nighttime, avoiding forbidden acts, patiently expecting the Relief, patience at times of calamities, and good companionship are all among the features of their religion.The ritual ablution - as the Sublime God decreed in His Book - is washing the face and the hands from the elbows, and pouring water over the head and the feet once. What invalidates the ablution is defecating, urination, farting, sleeping or going into a state of major ritual impurity.Whoever wipes water over his slippers or shoes (in the ritual ablution) is opposing the Sublime God and His Messenger , and abandons what is obligatory and His Book.The ritual bathing (ghusl) on Fridays is based on tradition. So is the ritual bathing on the two ‘Eids (al-adha and al-Fitr); upon entering Mecca or Medina; going on pilgrimage, entering the state of ritual consecration for the Hajj (or ‘Ihram), on the first night of the (Arabic) month of Ramadhan, the 17th night, the 19th night, the 21st night, the 23rd night of Ramadhan. All these are based on traditions. However, the ritual bathing for major ritual impurity is obligatory. So is the ritual bathing for menstruation.The obligatory prayers include the noon prayer that is four units, the afternoon prayer that is four units, the evening prayer that is three units, the night prayer that is four units, and the morning prayer that is two units. These are seventeen units of prayers. The recommendable prayers consist of thirty-four units. Eight units are for before the noon prayer, eight units are for before the afternoon prayer, four units are for after the evening prayer, two units that are to be said while sitting after the night prayer, eight units for dawn, even and odd - three units (odd) for which the ending ‘Salam is said after the second unit (making it even), and two units for the morning.Prayers said at the onset of their established times are nobler. The reward for congregational prayers is twenty-four times that of individual prayers. Do not pray behind a sinful congregational prayer leader. Pray only behind congregational prayer leaders who believe in Divine Leadership. Do not pray while you are wearing skins of dead animals or beasts.It is not permitted to say ‘As-salamu alaina wa ala ibadillah as-saleheen’ in the first ‘tashahud of the prayer since saying so implies termination of the prayer and once you say that your prayer ends.Shortening the prayers is valid after you travel four ‘farsakhs away from your home. When prayers are shortened while on a journey, fasting should be broken. If not, the fasting is void and should be made up later when you are no longer on a journey. ‘Qunut is obligatory in the following prayers - the morning prayer, the noon prayer, the afternoon prayer, the evening prayer and the night prayer.There are five times of saying God is the Greatest (takbir) required in funeral prayers. Whoever says it fewer times has opposed the tradition. When the corpse is being put into the grave, they should deliver it slowly with its feet going in first.It is a tradition to say ‘Bismillahir Rahmanir Rahim’ in a loud voice in all prayers. The obligatory alms-tax on each two-hundred Dirhams is five Dirhams. There is no alms-tax on less money. No alms-tax is required on property unless one years passes. It is not proper to pay the alms-tax to non-Shiites. The one-tenth levy on wheat, barley, dates and raisins is obligatory when they amount to as much as five wasqs. Each wasq equals sixty ‘saa’s each of which equals four mudds (3 kilograms)The alms-tax for fasting (zakat al-Fitr) is obligatory on everybody, whether they are young or old; free or a slave; male or female. It is prescribed on wheat, barley, dates, and raisins. It is four times half a bushel. It is not permitted to be given to anyone who is not from among our followers. The maximum period of menstruation is ten days, and the minimum period is three days. A semi-menstruant person should use cotton pads and perform the ritual bathing before she performs any prayers. The menstruant quits saying her prayers, and does not have to make up the prayers that she misses during her period of menstruation. She quits fasting, however, she should make up for the days of fasting that she misses.Fasting should be observed during the (Arabic) month of Ramadhan only when the new moon is seen, and should be stopped when the new moon (of the next month) is seen. It is invalid to offer the recommendable prayers in congregations as this would be an innovation (in religion). All innovations in religion result in our loss and we end up in the Fire. It is recommendable to fast during three days of every month - one day for each 10 days of the month: a Thursday from the first ten days, a Wednesday from the middle ten days, and a Thursday from the last ten days of the month. It is recommendable for one to fast during the (Arabic) month of Sha’ban. It is acceptable to make up the missed days of fasting of Ramadhan in different days.The Hajj pilgrimage to the Holy House of God is obligatory upon one who finds a way to do it. ‘Way’ in this regard stands for the needed funds and a way to go there - i.e. a means of transportation, and goodhealth. Any forms of Hajj pilgrimage except for that of ‘Tamattu (major) Hajj pilgrimage are not allowed except for the people of Mecca and those present there. It is also not allowed to opt for Hajj Ifraad or Hajj Al-Kiraan except for the people who live there. Entering the state of ritual consecration (or wearing ‘Ihram) is not allowed before reaching the ‘miqat. The Sublime God says, ‘And complete the Hajj or ’umra in the service of God…’ It is not allowed to offer for sacrifice a castrate sheep because it is imperfect. It is also not acceptable to offer for sacrifice a sheep whose testicles have been pressed between two rocks such that it has lost its libido.Jihad (the Holy War) is obligatory only under the leadership of a just leader. Whoever gets killed for defending his wealth is considered to be a martyr. It is not allowed to kill any atheists or imposters during their concealment of faith, except for murderers or aggressors who cause corruption; and only when you have no fear for the safety of yourself and your companions guaranteed from the aftermath. The concealment of faith is obligatory when needed. There is no expiation for telling lies in order to fend off oppression from oneself as a part of concealment of faith.Divorce is valid only when it is implemented according to Islamic laws that the Sublime God mentioned in His Book or according to the tradition of the Prophet (S). Any other form of divorce is invalid, including the forms that oppose the Book. Similarly, any form of marriage that opposes the Book is invalid. It is not allowed for a man to marry more than four free women at the same time. It is not allowed for a husband who divorces his wife three times to marry her again, until after she marries someone else. The Commander of the Faithful said, ‘Stay away from women (i.e. do not try to marry them) who were divorced three times at once, for they are still married women.’It is obligatory to send blessings upon the Prophet (S) in every situation, including when sneezing, slaughtering animals, and so on.It is obligatory to cherish the friends of the Sublime God and to hate and disavow the enemies of God, avoid them and their leaders.It is obligatory to treat one’s parents with kindness. In case the parents are polytheists, you may not obey them regarding disobedience to the Exalted the Honorable God. Neither should you do so by following others, as it is not allowed to obey any creatures by disobeying the Creator!The legality of a fetus (of an eatable animal) is proven when the legality of (a.s.laughtering of) its mother is proven.And the two allowed things for which the Sublime God has sent down decrees to you in His Book, and which God’s Prophet (S) has established as his traditions are temporary marriage and Hajj.The laws of the obligatory acts are exactly as they have been descended by the Sublime God in His Book. There should be no reduction in inheritance. No one inherits from one except for one’s parents and children. The only exception to this rule is for one’s husband or wife. The possessor of the share is more entitled (to inheritance) than him who has no share; and there exists no ‘asabah in God’s religion.An offering should be slaughtered for a newborn baby, whether male or female, on the seventh day after birth. On the same day, the baby’s hair should be cut, his name should be chosen, and charity equal in weight to his cut hair should be given in either gold or silver. Circumcision is a commendable and obligatory act for boys and is an honorable deed for girls.God the Blessed the Sublime said, ‘On no soul doth God Place a burden greater than it can bear…’ The people’s deeds are created (by the Sublime God) as optional deeds, not compulsory ones. The Sublime God created destiny, not indeterminism. God is the Creator of all things. Do not believe in fatalism or indeterminism. God the Majestic does not punish an innocent person instead of a sinful one. Likewise, He does not torment the children for the sins that their fathers have committed. God the Exalted says, ‘…No bearer of burdens can bear the burden of another…’ He also says, ‘That man can have nothing but what he strives for...’ God forgives, never treats (anyone) unjustly, never orders His servants to obey somebody that He knows would oppress them and lead them to deviation. He never chooses anyone to convey His Message whom He knows would disbelieve in Him and follow Satan.Islam is something different from faith. Every faithful believer is a Muslim. However, every Muslim is not a faithful believer. A thief is faithless the moment he commits robbery and an adulterer is faithless the moment he is committing adultery. The individuals who are subject to religious punishments are neither believers nor atheists - they are Muslims. The Sublime God will not submit the faithful believers to Hellafter He has promised them Paradise. Any atheist who is submitted to Hell will not depart from the Fire, since he has been promised the Fire and an eternal stay in it. He will not forgive anyone who associates partners with Him. However, He will forgive anyone else He wills for any other sins. Those who commit sins but believe in the Unity of God will not remain in the Fire. They will be taken out of it. Intercession is permissible for them. Nowadays is the time of concealment of faith since this land is only the land of Islam (and not the land of faith). It is neither the land of atheism nor is it the land of faith. It is obligatory to enjoin good and forbid evil when possible - that is when it would not threaten one’s own life. Faith includes returning what we are entrusted with, and abstaining from all major forbidden acts. It includes acknowledgement by the heart, verbal declaration, and acting according to the major principles (of the religion).Declaring that God is the Greatest is obligatory on the two ‘Eids. It is obligatory to say God is the Greatest after all the five prayers on ‘Eid ul-Fitr starting from the evening prayer on the day before the Eid. It is obligatory to say God is the Greatest after ten prayers on ‘Eid ul-Azha starting from the noon prayer on the day of the Eid. If one is at Mina, it is obligatory to say it after fifteen prayers.A woman during the puerperal state should not abandon saying her prayers for more than eighteen days. She should offer prayers if she becomes clean before the end of this period. However, if these eighteen days pass and she does not get clean, she should perform the ritual bath (ghusl), pray and act as the semi-menstruant does.And the belief in the agony of the grave, the angels Munkar and Nakeer, resurrection after death, the Scale, and the Bridge.All of the following are obligatory: The belief in the disavowal of those who oppressed (and still oppress) the Members of the Holy Household of Muhammad - especially those who tried to force them out (of their homes), began oppressing them; and changed the traditions established by their Prophet (S). It is obligatory to disavow those who breach their covenants (nakitheen), the hypocrites, and the Kharijites who dishonoured the veil of the Household of God’s Prophet (S) by breaking their covenants with their Leader, having that lady (Aa’isha) ride a camel, (and taking her to Basra); started to fight with the Commander ofthe Faithful ; killed the pious Shiites whom God may forgive. It is also obligatory to disavow those who denounced the good companions and deported them, honored those who had abandoned God’s Prophet (S), distributed government funds among the rich and put the fools in charge of the Muslims’ affairs such as Mo’awiya and Amr ibn al-‘Aass - who were both damned by God’s Prophet (S). It is also obligatory to disavow those of their friends who fought with the Commander of the Faithful , killed the Helpers (Ansar), the Immigrants (Muhajireen), the noble ones and the good doers from the past. It is also obligatory to disavow those who believe in the setting up of the council, and disavow Abu Musa al-Ash’ari, and those of his friends - ‘those whose efforts have been wasted in this life, while they thought that they were acquiring good by their works. They are those who deny the Signs of their Lord…’ They disbelieved in the authority of the Commander of the Faithful and in this state they will meet their Lord! They disbelieved and they will meet God while not believing in his Divine Leadership. Thus they have ruined their deeds. Then we will not set up any Scale of Deeds for them on the Resurrection Day for their deeds to be weighed! They will be the dogs which reside in the Fire. It is also obligatory to disavow the first and the last one of those built-up idols who were the leaders into corruption and loss, the forerunners of oppression. It is also obligatory to disavow those who ham-strung the she-camel of Salih - they were the oppressors of the first and the last, and of anyone who is friends with them.And the friendship with the Commander of the Faithful and with those who followed the way of their Prophet (S), and who did not change their way such as Salman al-Farsi, Abu Tharr al-Ghifari, al-Miqdad ibn al-Aswad, Ammar bin Yasir, Hothayfa al-Yamani, Abil Haytham ibn al-Tayyihan, Sahl ibn Honayf, Ubada ibn As-Samit, Abi Ayyoub Al-Ansari, Khozayma ibn Thabit Thull-Shahadatayn, Abi Sa’eed al-Khodri and the like - may God be pleased with and have Mercy upon them - is obligatory. And the friendship with their followers who have been guided along their path - may God be pleased with them - is obligatory.And the forbiddance of alcohol - whether a little or a lot, the forbiddance of all intoxicating drinks - whether a little or a lot, the forbiddance of any small amount of whatever a lot of is intoxicating. Even if one is compelled to drink, he should not since it will kill him. Canine beasts and all birds with claws are forbidden to eat. Eating spleens is forbidden, since it is like eating blood. The eating of all floating (dead) fish, eels, sheatfish, and scaleless fish is forbidden.It is also obligatory to believe in (the necessity of) the abstinence from the forbidden deeds - which include killing that the Sublime God has forbidden; fornication; stealing; drinking alcohol; ingratitude to parents; fleeing from the battle-field; wrongful use of orphans’ property; eating dead animal’s meat; drinking blood; eating pork; or eating the meat of any animal that is slaughtered and consecrated in the name of someone (or something) other than God - except in states of utmost necessity. Furthermore, it is furthermore obligatory to believe in the forbiddance of usury after getting to know about it, unlawful trade; gambling; cheating in weighing and measuring; false accusation of married women; sodomy; perjury; being despaired of receiving God’s Comfort; feeling of security from God’s unexpected plans; losing hope in God’s Mercy; supporting oppressors and relying upon them; false swearing; not paying back other people’s rights even though one is able to do so; deceit and arrogance; being wasteful or miserly; treachery; belittling the pilgrimage to the Kaaba; fighting with the Sublime God’s friends; engaging in licentious acts; and finally (but not last) insistence on committing sins.Moreover, Hamza ibn Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn Ja’far ibn Muhammad ibn Zayd ibn Ali ibn Al-Husayn ibn Ali ibn Abi Talib narrated that Abu Nasr Qanbar ibn Ali ibn Shathan quoted on the authority of his father Al-Fadhl ibn Shathan, narrated a similar account on the authority of Ali ibn Musa Ar-Ridha’ - with the exception that he did not mention that the Imam wrote (a letter) to Al-Ma’mun. In addition, in his tradition the letter also states that “The alms-tax for fasting is one bushel of wheat or two bushels of barley, dates or raisins.” In addition it mentions that, “When making ablutions, washing once is obligatory, but washing twice is recommendable.” It also states that, “The sins of the Prophets are minor ones and are forgiven.” It was also written that the alms-tax is due on nine things being wheat, barley, dates, raisins, camels, cows, sheep, gold and silver.” However, the tradition narrated by Abdul Wahid ibn Muhammad ibn Abdoos - may God be pleased with him - is more reliable in my opinion.And al-Hakim Abu Muhammad Ja’far ibn Nu’aym ibn Shathan - may God be pleased with him - narrated the same on the authority of his uncle Abi Abdullah Muhammad ibn Shathan, on the authority of Ar-Ridha’ just as Abdul Wahid ibn Muhammad ibn Abdoos had narrated.And al-Hakim Abu Muhammad Ja’far ibn Nu’aym ibn Shathan - may God be pleased with him - narrated that his uncle Abi Abdullah Muhammad ibn Shathan quoted on the authority of Fadhl ibn Shathan, a tradition similar to that narrated by Abdul Wahid Muhammad ibn Ubdoos on the authority of Ar-Ridha’ .And among the other traditions from Ar-Ridha’ , we can cite the following ones:"

How is that?” Ar-Ridha’ said, “When Abdullah ibn 'Amir ibn Kariz conquered Khorasan, he captured two of the daughters of Yazdegerd, the Persian King and sent them to Othman ibn Affan. He granted one of them to Al-Hassan and the other one to Al-Husayn . They both died during childbirth. The wife of Al-Husayn delivered Ali ibn Al-Husayn . Since she died during delivery, one of the maids - who was Umm Walad of one of Al-Husayn’s grandchildren took care of him (while another woman breast-fed him). The Imam grew up and knew no one else to be his mother, but later he realized that she had only been his care-taker. The people considered her Umm Walad to be his mother. When he married her, they thought that he has married his own mother. Take refuge in God! It was not so. This woman was living in Ali ibn Al-Husayn’s house. Once after Ali ibn Al-Husayn had finished making love to one of his wives and was leaving the room to go and make the ritual ablutions, that woman saw him. He asked her, “If you also wish to be married, fear God and tell me.” She replied, “Yes.” Then the Imam married her, too. Since the people considered her to be his mother, they spread the rumors that Ali ibn Al-Husayn had married his own mother.”(Muhammad ibn Yahya al-Sowli added,) “Oun told me that Sahl ibn Qasim that all of Abu Talib’s descendants had narrated this tradition of Ar-Ridha’ from me.”"

(897 A.D.), al-Hakim Abu Ali Al-Husayn ibn Ahmad al-Bayhaqi narrated that Muhammad ibn Yahya al-Sowli quoted on the authority of Abu Thakwan Al-Qasim ibn Isma’il in Seiraf on the authority of Ibrahim ibn Abbas al-Sowli al-Katib in (the city of) Ahwaz in the year 227 A.H. (841 A.D.), “One day we were in the company of Ali ibn Musa Ar-Ridha’ and he told me, ‘There is no true joy in this world.’ Some of the jurisprudents present there said, ‘It is not so. Did not God the Honorable the Exalted say? ‘Then, shall ye be questioned that Day about the joy (ye indulged in!).’ Is it not just the cold water we drink in this world?’” Then Ar-Ridha’ told them in a loud voice, ‘That is how you interpret it and bring about several forms of interpretation for it.’ Some said, ‘It is cold water.’ Others said, ‘It is delicious food.’ Still others said, ‘It is good sleep.’ Ar-Ridha’ said, ‘I quote on the authority of my father , on the authority of his father Abi Abdullah As-Sadiq that what you said about the Sublime God’s words, ‘Then, shall ye be questioned that Day about the joy (ye indulged in!)’ were told to him.Then Imam As-Sadiq got angry and said, ‘The Exalted the Honorable God will neither question His servants about what He has nobly bestowed upon them, nor will He mention it to them. Even mentioning a good deed is bad for the people to do. How could they ascribe to God the Exalted the Honorable what God’s creatures will not be pleased with? However, the true joy is the love for us - the Members of the Holy Household. This is what God will question the people about after questioning them about the Unity of God and the Prophethood. If one has been loyal to this he will be rewarded with Heaven which is the Eternal Joy. My father had indeed hear this from his father who had heard it from his forefathers all the way back to the Commander of the Faithful who said, “God’s Prophet (S) said, ‘O Ali! Indeed, the first thing that one will be questioned about after death is to testify that ‘There is no god but God’ and that ‘Muhammad is God’s Messenger.’ He will also be questioned about testifying that ‘You (Ali) are the one with authority over the believers due to the authority which God has established and I have established for you.’ Whoever believes in these will be sent to the Joy in which there is no end.’”(Muhammad ibn Yahya al-Sowli added,) Abu Thakwan narrated this tradition for me without me asking him to do so. When he finished, he said, “I told you this tradition for several reasons. First of all, you have come to visit me from Basra. Secondly, its narrator is your uncle (Ibrahim bin Abbas al-Sowli). Thirdly, I was always interested solely in poetry and linguistics and did not pay any attention to anything else, until I dreamt of the Prophet (S). The people were greeting him, and he greeted them back. I went forward and greeted the Prophet (S) but he did not return my greetings. Al-Sowli asked, “O Prophet of God! Am I not from among your nation?” He said, “Yes, you are. But tell the people the tradition about “joy” that you have heard from Ibrahim.” Al-Sowli said, “This is the tradition which the people narrate on the authority of God’s Prophet (S). However, there is not such a description of “joy” in it with verses and interpretations. They just say that God’s Prophet (S) said, “The very first thing one is questioned about on the Resurrection Day is to testify to the Unity (of God), the Prophethood and the Authority of Ali ibn Abi Talib .”"

My grandfather was called “Pasandeh” since Ar-Ridha’ was pleased with his house and chose it to reside in. “Pasandeh” is a Farsi word meaning ‘pleased with.’ When he enteredour house he planted an almond tree in a corner of the yard. That plant grew for one year until it turned into a big almond tree yielding almonds. When the people became informed about this, they started picking the almonds to heal their patients. Whoever was ill was blessed by eating an almond from that tree. He would eat it and get healed. Whoever had any eye pains would place an almond from that tree on his eyes and they would be healed.Whenever a pregnant woman had severe labour pains, she would eat one of the almonds and her delivery became easy. Whenever any of the animals had colic, they would tie one of the branches of that tree under its stomach and it was healed by the blessings of Ar-Ridha’ . Some time passed and that tree dried up. Then my grandfather chopped off some of its branches and then he lost his sight. Then Ibn Hamdan who was called Abu Amr cut off its trunk and destroyed it. Later his property worth seventy to eighty thousand Dirhams was destroyed at the gateway to Fars. He lost it all and nothing was left for him. Abu Amr had two sons who worked for Muhammad ibn Ibrahim ibn Samjoor. One was called Abul Qasim and the other one was called Abu Sadiq. They decided to reconstruct the house. They saved up twenty thousand Dirhams to do so. During the reconstruction, they pulled out the roots of that tree not knowing what would happen to them. Later on one of them became in charge of the lands, the property and the gardens of Khorasan’s governor. He returned in a carriage after some time with his whole right leg turned black. The meat slowly disintegrated and he died in less than one month. The older brother became employed in the office of Neishaboor’s ruler. A group of people gathered around him. He had a fine handwriting style.One day when all the workers were present one of his workers said, ‘May God protect the owner of this beautiful handwriting from the evil eye.’ Just then his hands started to shake. The pen fell out of his hand and his hand abscessed. He went home. Abul Abbas - the secretary - and some other people went to see him. They told him, ‘This is due to high blood pressure. You should have a phlebotomy performed.’ He accepted and had a blood-letting done. They came back the next day and told him, ‘You must have a phlebotomy performed.’ He did so again, but his hand turned black and he died due to that. Both brothers died in a period of less than one year.”"

You are leaving us and you will not inform us of any traditions to benefit us?” He was sitting in a carriage. Then he brought his head out and said, “I heard my father Musa ibn Ja’far say that his father Ja’far ibn Muhammad quoted on the authority of his father Muhammad ibn Ali , on the authority of his father Ali ibn Al-Husayn , on the authority of his father Al-Husayn ibn Ali , on the authority of his father Ali ibn Abi Talib , on the authority of the Prophet (S) thathe had heard Gabriel say that God the Honorable the Exalted said, “There is no god but God” is My Stronghold. Whoever enters My Stronghold is secure from My Punishment.” When they moved on, he loudly said, “There are certain conditions for this. And I am one of these conditions.”The author of this book (a.s.heikh Sadooq) - may God forgive him - said, “One of the conditions of confessing to “there is no god but God” is confessing to the Trusteeship of Ar-Ridha’ that has been established by God the Exalted the Honorable over the servants. Obeying him is incumbent upon them.” It is also said that when Ar-Ridha’ entered Neishaboor he went to take a bath in a part of town called Al-Farwini where there was a bath that is nowadays known as “the bath of Ar-Ridha’ .” There was a well which was about to dry up. He appointed someone to go in the well and clean it out until the water in the well increased. A pond was built outside the gate of the well. There were several stairs to climb down to fill the pond with water from the well. They filled the pond with water, and Ar-Ridha’ bathed in it. Then he came out and prayed outside the pond. The people took turns, entered the pond, performed their ritual ablutions, came out and prayed. They drank a few drops of that water seeking its blessings, praised God the Exalted the Honorable and asked Him to fulfill their needs. This is the same pond that exists today and is known as the Kahlan. People go there from all places."

Will you pray?” He got off (his mule) and said, “Bring me some water.” They said, “We have no water.” He dug the ground with his hands and water started to flow out. He and those with him all made their ablutions with that water. The water is still there today. When they entered Sanabad he faced the hill from which they make stone pots and said, “O God! Please grant benefits by it. Bless whatever they place there and whatever they build from it.”Then he ordered a few stone pots to be built from that hill for him and said, “Please do not make any food for me unless you cook it in these pots.” He used to eat very little. He also ate simple food. The people were thus guided towards him and the blessing of his prayers became apparent from that hill. Then he went to the house of Hamid ibn Qahtaba al-Ta’ee. He went to the grave in which Harun Al-Rashid was buried. Then he drew a line next to it and said, “This is my grave. I will be buried here. God will establish this place to be the place where my followers and friends will come and go. By God, whoever visits me and sends greetings upon me will be certainly forgiven by God. He will benefit from God’s Mercy due to our intercession - the intercession of the Members of the Holy Household.” Then he turned towards the Qibla and said prayers and supplications. Then he prostrated for a long time. I counted. He praised the Glory of God for five hundred times. Then he stopped."

This is a charm which I never separate from myself.” I said, “Could you honor me with it?” He said, “This is a charm. Calamities will be warded off from whoever has it in his pocket. He will be secured from all calamities. It is a protection for him against the evils of the damned Satan (and from the King).” He then dictated the charm to Hamid. It is as follows, “In the Name of God the Beneficent, the Merciful. In the Name of God. I take refuge in the Merciful from you - whether you are pious or not. By God - the One who hears and sees all - I shut off your ears and eyes. You have no power over me, my ears, my eyes, my hair, my skin, my meat, my blood, my brain, my nerves, mybones, my family, my property, and the daily bread that God bestows upon me. I draw a veil between me and you - a veil of the Prophets by which God’s Prophets protected themselves from the Kings of the Pharaoh. Gabriel is on my right side, Michael is on my left side. Israfil is behind me. And Muhammad is in front of me. God is informed about me, and will protect me from you and from Satan. O my Lord! May not Satan’s ignorance overcome Thy Patience so as to make me frightened and belittled. O my Lord! I take refuge in Thee. O my Lord! I take refuge in Thee. O my Lord! I take refuge in Thee.”"

I recognized your knowledge, nobility, abstinence, piety and servitude. I have realized that you deserve to be the Caliph more than I do.’ Then Ar-Ridha’ told him, ‘I am proud of servitude to God the Honorable the Exalted. I seek protection against the evils of this world through abstinence. I hope to attain prosperity and Divine Profit by practicing piety regarding the forbidden things. I hope to attain a high rank before God the Honorable the Exalted by being humble in this world.’ Al-Ma’mun told him, ‘I am planning to dismiss myself from the post of the Caliphate and assign you to that post and pledge allegiance to you.’ Then Ar-Ridha’ told him, ‘If this Caliphate is yours, then God has established it for you and it is not proper for you to relieve yourself of it and place someone else in that position. But if it is not yours, you are not authorized to give what is not yours to me.’Al-Ma’mun told him, ‘O son of the Prophet! You are forced to accept this order.’ Ar-Ridha’ said, ‘I will never accept this willingly.’ Al-Ma’mun kept insisting on this issue day after day until he lost all hope. Then he said, ‘Now that you do not accept the Caliphate and do not let me pledge allegiance to you as the Caliph, you must accept the succession to the throne (to be the caliph after me).’ Then Ar-Ridha’ told him, ‘I swear by God that my father narrated that his forefathers quoted on the authority of the Commander of the Faithful , on the authority of God’s Prophet (S) that I will leave this world before you by being oppressively poisoned. The angels of the heavens and the Earth will cry for me. I will be buried in the land of loneliness next to Harun Al-Rashid.’ Then Al-Ma’mun cried. Then he asked, ‘O son of the Prophet of God! Who will kill you? Who will be able to or dare do such a thing to you for as long as I live?’ Then Ar-Ridha’ said, ‘I will only introduce my murderer if I please.’ Al-Ma’mun said, ‘O son of the Prophet of God! Do you want to relieve yourself from accepting the succession to the throne with these words, so that the people say to themselves how greatly you abstain from the world?’ Ar-Ridha’ said, ‘By God, I have never lied from the day God the Honorable the Exalted created me. I have not abstained from the world to attain this world. I know very well what it is that you are after.’ Al-Ma’mun asked, ‘What am I after?’ Ar-Ridha’ replied, ‘Will you grant immunity for an honest answer?’ Al-Ma’mun said, ‘You are immune.’ Ar-Ridha’ said, ‘You wish for the people to say: Ali ibn Musa (ar-Ridha’) has not abstained from the world. Rather it is the world that has abstained from him. Don’t you see how he accepted the succession to the throne in greed for the post of Caliphate?’ Then Al-Ma’mun became angry and said, ‘You constantly treat me in the way that I do not like, as if you are immune from my power. I swear by God that you must accept the succession to the throne yourself, or else I will force you to do so. If you accept it yourself it is fine. However, if you do not, I will chop off your head.’ Then Ar-Ridha’ said, ‘Indeed God the Highest has admonished me against getting myself killed. If the situation is as you say, then do as you please. I will accept it under the condition that I do not interfere in dismissals or appointments, nor change any practices or traditions. I will just be a distant advisor.’ Al-Ma’mun accepted these conditions and established Ar-Ridha’ as the successor to the throne, even though the Imam disliked it."

He stepped forward, greeted him and said, ‘O son of the Prophet! I have composed a few verses about you and would like you to hear them.’ Ar-Ridha’ said, ‘Let us hear them,’ so he said,Cleansed and Purified are they,When mentioned, they are sanctified,Wherever they may be, near or far;When roots and lines are identified,If not Alawides, they indeed are With nothing to boast or pride In their lineage, in their deed;For when God created man and eyedYou He selected and favoured indeed And raised above the rest and allWith the knowledge of His Qur’anAnd its verses hold your head high!’Ar-Ridha’ said, ‘You have composed poetry that nobody else has been able to do so far.’ Then Ar-Ridha’ asked his servant, ‘O young man! Is any of our spending money left?’ He replied, ‘Yes. Three hundred Dinars is left.’ The Imam said, ‘Give it all to him (the poet).’ Then the Imam said, ‘O young man! He may consider that not to be enough. Thus give him the mule, too.’ When the year 201 A.H. (816 A.D.) arrived, Ishaq ibn Musa ibn Isa ibn Musa became the head of the pilgrimage caravan to Hajj. He prayed for Al-Ma’mun and for Ali ibn Musa Ar-Ridha’ to succeed him as the successor to the throne (in his sermon). Then Hamdooyeh ibn Ali ibn Isa ibn Mahan objected. Ishaq asked (his servant) for his own official black clothing. Since he did not find it, he grabbed a black flag, wrapped it around himself and told the people, ‘O people! I informed you of what I was ordered to. Now I only acknowledge the Commander of the Faithful - Al-Ma’mun and Al-Fadhl ibn Sahl.’ Then he stepped down (from the pulpit)."

He made a gesture to them to become silent and after hearing their words, he said, ‘In the Name of God, the Beneficent, the Merciful. Praise be to God who does whatever He wills. No one can object to His Decrees. No one can reject His Destiny. He knows whatevertreason that lies in one’s heart from the sight and whatever is hidden in the hearts. May God’s Blessings be upon Muhammad, upon the first and the last creatures, upon his good and pure Household.’ He then added, ‘I am Ali ibn Musa ibn Ja’far. Indeed the Commander of the Faithful (Al-Ma’mun) - may God assist him in righteousness and make him successful in being rational - has recognized one of our rights which others were ignorant about. He has established ties of kinship which others have broken. He has granted security to people who lived in fear. He even revived them and rescued them from destruction. He enriched them when they were in need. He was seeking the pleasure of the Lord of the Two Worlds in doing all this. He did not ask anyone but Him to reward him. God will reward the ones who are grateful. He will not let the reward of the good-doers be forgotten. He turned over the succession to the throne to me. He has entrusted his great rule to me after him. And whoever breaks a contract that God has ordered to be safeguarded, and loosens ties which God likes to be tightened has indeed underestimated God’s Bounds, and has allowed what God has forbidden. In this way, he has denied the leader of his right and has disobeyed his orders. He has thus disrespected Islam as was done in the past. The Trustee (Ali ibn Abi Talib ) put up with all the instances of breaching of the covenants, and did not even object to those later when he was in power, fearing dispersion in the religion and turmoil in the ties which held the Muslims together. This was because the ideas of the Age of Ignorance were still in their minds and the hypocrites were on the watch to get a chance to create havoc. Now I do not know what is going to happen to me and you. Indeed there is no arbitrator but God. He is the only One who clarifies the truth. He is the best Separator.”"

This was not possible to do. Therefore, from Khorasan Al-Ma’mun sent Abi ad-Dhahhaq and Yasir - the servant to bring Muhammad ibn Ja’far ibn Muhammad (one of Imam As-Sadiq’s offspring) and Ali ibn Musa ibn Ja’far to him. This happened in the year 200 A.H. (815 A.D.). When they brought Ali ibn Musa to Al-Ma’mun in Marv, he appointed Ali ibn Musa as the successor to the throne after himself. He also ordered that the troops be granted one full year’s salary. He declared this issue to all Muslim lands. He called him Ar-Ridha’ and had silver coins coined in Ar-Ridha’’s name. He ordered the people to put aside their black clothing that was a sign of the Abbasids, and asked them all to wear green clothing. Then he married off his daughter Umm Habib to Ar-Ridha’ , and married off his other daughter Ummul Fadhl to Ar-Ridha’’s son, Muhammad ibn Ali . He himself married Pooran - the daughter of Al-Hassan ibn al-Sahl. This was because of her uncle Fadhl and all of this happened in one day. However, Al-Ma’mun did not really like that the Caliphate (the rule) be turned over to Ar-Ridha’ after him.Al-Sowli added, “What Ubaydillah ibn Abdullah narrated for me was correct from several points of view. Oun ibn Muhammad narrated on the authority of Al-Fadhl ibn Abi Sahl Al-Nowbakhti - or from his brother - that when Al-Ma’mun decided to establish Ar-Ridha’ as the successor to the throne, I told myself, ‘By God, I will test Al-Ma’mun to see if he sincerely wants to do this or not.’ Then I wrote a letter as follows and handed it to his servant who was the one who reported Al-Ma’mun’s secrets to me in writing, “Thul-Riasatayn has decided to draw up the contract for succession to the throne. The horoscope is in position of Cancer, the fourth sign of the Zodiac (the fourth month). Jupiter and Cancer are in it. Even though Jupiter is in the upright position it is a month of turmoil. Whatever contract is established in that month will have no good ending. Additionally, Mars is in Libra. That is in the seventh house which indicates that any contracts established in it are unfortunate. I am reporting this to the Commander of the Faithful so thatyou do not blame me for not doing so, if anyone else reports it to you.’ Al-Ma’mun replied, ‘Return this letter by the same messenger who delivered it to you as soon as you read its contents. Take care that no one finds out about what you wrote to me, since that might result in Thul-Riasatayn changing his mind. Beware that if anyone finds out, I will consider you to be blameworthy for negligence.’ As soon as I read the reply, the world became too small for me and I wished that I had never written him that letter. However, Thul-Riasatayn Al-Fadhl ibn Sahl himself feared this bad horoscope and changed his mind since he had sufficient knowledge of astrology. However, I swear by God that I feared for my life. I rode towards where he was and asked him, ‘Do you know of any star in the sky that is more prosperous than Jupiter?’ He said, ‘No?’ I asked, ‘Do you know of any stars in the sky that are more prosperous than Jupiter in the upright position?’ He said, ‘No.’ Then I said, ‘Then do not change your mind about drawing up the contract for the succession to the throne. Do not change your mind while the sky star of prosperity being Jupiter is in its most prosperous position being the upright position.’ Thul-Riasatayn then decided to continue on with what he had decided to do, and drew up the contract. However, I feared Al-Ma’mun and did not know whether I would be dead or alive until the succession to the throne took place.”"

Some of the poems were written in his own handwriting. The manuscript of these poems was in the possession of Ibrahim’s friend - Ishaq until Ibrahim ibn Abbas became in charge of the Lands Office for Al-Mutawakkil. Various problems had for some reason made him distant from Zaydan’s brother. When Al-Mutawakkil dismissed Ibrahim from the office that he was in charge of, Ibrahim was stern with Ishaq and demanded some property from him. Ishaq asked someone that he trusted to go to Ibrahim ibn Abbas, and tell him that the poems he had composed in praise of Ar-Ridha’ which were partly written in his own handwriting and some had been written in other people’s handwriting, were with him. Ishaq threatenedthat if Ibrahim did not stop his demands, he would send all the poems to al-Mutawakkil. The man delivered Ishaq’s message to Ibrahim. This was hard on Ibrahim, but he stopped his claims in return for the manuscript of his poems. They pledged not to make any reports on this to al-Mutawakkil. Al-Sowli added, “Yahya ibn al-Monajjim said, ‘I intervened between the two until I got a hold of the manuscript and Ibrahim ibn Al-Abbas burnt them in front of me.’ Al-Sowli added, ‘Ahmad ibn Malhan narrated that Ibrahim ibn Abbas had two sons named Al-Hassan and Al-Husayn. Their nicknames were Abi Muhammad and Abi Abdullah. When al-Mutawakkil became the Caliph, Ibrahim changed the name of his older son to Ishaq, and changed his nickname to Abi Muhammad. He also named his younger son Abbas and changed his nickname to Abil Fadhl due to fear.’ Al-Sowli added, ‘Ahmad ibn Isma’il ibn al-Khateeb told me that Ibrahim ibn Abbas and Musa ibn Abdul Malik never drank wine until the rule of Al-Mutawakkil came. During his rule they both drank and purposefully gave parties with bad men and sissies; and drank with them three times each day so that the news of this spread around. There are also other traditions about this, but there is no room to mention them here.’"

al-Warraq - may God be pleased with them - narrated that Ali ibn Ibrahim ibn Hashem quoted that when Yasir - the servant - returned from Khorasan after the martyrdom of Ar-Ridha’ in Toos, he told me all the news about the events which had happened. Ali ibn Ibrahim narrated that Rayyan ibn al-Salt, who was one of Al-Hassan ibn Sahl’s men and my father quoted on the authority of Muhammad ibn Arafat and Salh ibn Sa’eed Al-Rashidi that all quoted the (following) news about Abil Hassan Ar-Ridha’ , “When the time of the dismissed Caliph (al-Amin) was finished and Al-Ma’mun took over the Caliphate, he wrote a letter to Ar-Ridha’ and invited him to Khorasan. However, Ar-Ridha’ refused for several reasons. However, Al-Ma’mun did not stop here and kept on insisting until Ar-Ridha’ got convinced that he was not going to stop. Then Ar-Ridha’ left for Marv when his son Abu Ja’far was only seven years old. Al-Ma’mun wrote to him instructing not to come by way of Kufa and Qum. Rather, he was taken to Marv by way of Basra, Ahwaz and Fars. When he arrived in Marv, Al-Ma’mun told him to accept the ranksof Divine Leadership and Caliphate. However, Ar-Ridha’ refused this. However, Al-Ma’mun insisted on it a lot. This kept going on for two months, until after a lot of discussions Al-Ma’mun suggested Ar-Ridha’ accept the post of the successor to the throne. He accepted this and told him, ‘(I will only accept this) upon conditions that I will state.’ Then Al-Ma’mun said, ‘State your conditions.’ Then Ar-Ridha’ wrote, ‘I will accept the succession to the throne upon the conditions that I neither issue any orders, nor do I admonish against anything; I neither judge, nor change anything; that I be excused from all such affairs.’ Then Al-Ma’mun accepted this. He accepted all his conditions and invited the governors, the judges, the army heads, the office workers and all the Abbasids to come and pledge allegiance to him. He spent a lot of money and granted rewards to the army heads and satisfied them all except for three of the army heads named Isa al-Joloodi, Ali ibn Imran and Abu Yunus who did not accept to pledge allegiance to Ar-Ridha’ . Then he imprisoned them. The people pledged allegiance to Ar-Ridha’ . This was declared in writing to all the towns. Coins were issued in Ar-Ridha’’s name and sermons were delivered in his name on the pulpits. Al-Ma’mun made a lot of donations. When the holidays came, Al-Ma’mun sent someone after Ar-Ridha’ and asked him to ride to the congregation, and deliver the ‘Eid prayer and sermon to reassure the people, so that they would recognize his nobility and wholeheartedly attract them to this blessed government. Then Ar-Ridha’ sent someone to him who said, ‘You are aware of the conditions set between you and I in accepting this affair.’ Then Al-Ma’mun said, ‘I only want the public, the army and the office workers to feel sure about this affair, feel secure in their hearts and recognize the nobility that God has granted you.’ This discussion kept going on back and forth until the Imam realized that Al-Ma’mun was insisting. Then Ar-Ridha’ said, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! I prefer that you excuse me from doing this. However, if you insist, I must perform the prayer just like God’s Prophet (S) and the Commander of the Faithful Ali ibn Abi Talib did.’ He said, ‘Fine. Do it as you wish.’ Then Al-Ma’mun ordered the troops and the people to be at Abil Hassan Ar-Ridha’’s residence in the morning. All the people gathered around the house of Abil Hassan Ar-Ridha’ . All the lanes and the streets were filled with men, women and children. All the troops gathered around the door of Ar-Ridha’’s house. Then when the sun rose, Ar-Ridha’ stood up, made ablutions, put on a white cotton turban letting one side of it falldown upon his chest and the other side fall behind his head. He took off his socks and slippers and told all his friends to do the same. He held a cane in his hand and left the house. We gathered around him. He was in bare feet and had rolled up his pants half-way to the knees. He had rolled up the outer robe he was wearing half-way up. When he came among us, we were walking ahead of him. He raised his head up to the sky and shouted God is the Greatest four times. We all felt that the heavens and the buildings were all shouting the same. The troops and the people at the door were all standing there in an orderly fashion. The troops had their weapons and were really majestic. When we appeared to them in this (above-mentioned) form with bare feet and having wrapped up our outer robes, and Ar-Ridha’ had appeared among the people, he stopped at the door and said, Allahu Akbar! Allahu Akbar! Allahu Akbar Ala ma Hadana! Allahu Akbar Al ma Razaqana Min Bahimatel An’am! walhamdullilah-e-Ala ma Ablana! He raised his voice, and so did we. We kept on saying the Festival’s glorifications. At once, the whole city of Marv broke out in tears and cried out. He said the above three times. The soldiers got off their horses, took off their boots and left them when they saw Abil Hassan . All of Marv broke out in tears and mourning. The people could not stop crying. Abul Hassan took ten steps, stopped and repeated the glorifications four times. It was just as if the heavens and all the buildings responded to him. Al-Ma’mun was informed about this. Thul-Riasatayn Al-Fadhl ibn Sahl told him, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! Should Ar-Ridha’ reach the place for the prayer in this way, it will cause sedition among the people. Consider asking him to return.’ Then Al-Ma’mun sent someone to Ar-Ridha’ and asked him to return home. He asked for his slippers and returned home."

pleased with him - narrated that Ali ibn Ibrahim ibn Hashem quoted on the authority of Al-Rayyan ibn al-Salt, “Those of the people from the public or the soldiers who pledged allegiance to Ar-Ridha’ , but were not, pleased to do so said, ‘This is one of the plans of Thul-Riasatayn Al-Fadhl ibn Sahl.’ This was told to Al-Ma’mun. Then he sent for me at midnight. I went to him. He said to me, ‘O Rayyan! I have been informed that the people say that the pledge of allegiance to Ar-Ridha’ was one of the plans of Al-Fadhl ibn Sahl.’ I told him, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! So they say.’ He said, ‘O Rayyan! Woe be to you! Does anyonedare to suggest to a Caliph - born of a Caliph - who possesses the rule (to whom all the people and the troops are obedient), to turn his rule over to someone else with his own hands? Does the intellect allow this?’ I said, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! By God! No one dares to do that.’ Al-Ma’mun said, ‘No, it is not as they say, however, I will tell you the reason. When my brother Muhammad ordered me to go to him, I refused to do so. He issued an order to Ali ibn Isa ibn Mahan to arrest me and place a yoke around my neck. I was informed about this order. I dispatched Harthama ibn A’yan to Sejistan, Kerman and its suburbs. He did not properly manage this affair and was defeated. The governor of Sarir rebelled and captured one of the regions of Khorasan. All this happened within one week. When this happened, I did not have the power to resist. I did not have any wealth either to get some power. I saw nothing but fear and cowardliness in my troops. I decided to seek refuge with the king of Kabul (in Afghanistan) who was a pagan. But then It occurred to me that if my brother Muhammad sends some money for him in return for me, the King might turn me over to him since he is an atheist. I found no better way than to repent to God the Highest of my sins, seek His assistance regarding these affairs, and seek refuge with God the Highest. Then I ordered that they clean this house - (as he pointed to a room). They cleaned it. I made ablutions with water, put on white pants and a smock and said four units of prayers in which I recited whatever of the Qur’an I knew. I prayed to God the Highest, sought refuge in Him, and sincerely made a strong covenant with Him to return the right to its true place and to turn over the Divine Leadership to its proper owner whom God has set - if He helps me overcome these difficulties. Then I calmed down. I sent Tahir towards Ali ibn Isa ibn Mahan. With him things went on as I mentioned before. Again I sent Harthama ibn A’yan to defeat Rafi’. He defeated him and killed him. I invited the governor of Sarir to make peace and sent him gifts. I treated him with kindness until he quit opposing me. I got stronger and stronger until what happened to (my brother) Muhammad happened. And God the Highest turned all the affairs over to me and I was in power. Since God the Highest had fulfilled what I had asked Him for, and I wanted to honor my covenant with God, I saw that no one but Abil Hassan Ar-Ridha’ deserved the right to be in charge. That is why I offered the rule to him, but he refused. Then he accepted it in the way that you know of. This was the reason.’ Then I (Rayyan) said, ‘May God make theCommander of the Faithful successful!’ He said, ‘O Ray’yan! When the morning comes and the people come out, go among the army heads and tell them about the nobilities of the Commander of the Faithful - Ali ibn Abi Talib .’ I told him, ‘I know nothing about him except for what I have heard from you. Should I just restate that?’ He said, “Glory be to God! I find no one to help me in this affair. I considered the people of Qum to be trustworthy.’ I said, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! Should I tell them the traditions that I have heard from you?’ He said, ‘Yes. Tell them about the nobilities of Ali that you have heard from me.’ When the morning came, I went amongst the army heads and said, ‘The Commander of the Faithful has narrated that his father quoted on the authority of his forefathers, on the authority of God’s Prophet (S): ‘Whoever I am the master of, Ali is the master of.’ The Commander of the Faithful has narrated that his father quoted (the following) on the authority of his forefathers, on the authority of God’s Prophet (S): ‘The position of Ali relative to me is similar to that of Aaron to Moses.’ I did not remember the traditions exactly and made some mistakes. I narrated the tradition about Khaybar and other well-known traditions.’” Then Abdullah ibn Malik al-Khoza’ee said, “May God have Mercy upon Ali. He was a good man.” Al-Ma’mun had sent a servant to our meeting to hear what we said and report it to him. Then he sent someone after me. When I went there and he saw me, he said, “O Rayyan! You know many traditions by heart. I was informed about what that Jew, Abdullah ibn Malik, said, ‘May God have Mercy upon Ali. He was a good man.’ By God! I will kill him - God willing.”Hisham ibn Ibrahim al-Rashedi al-Hamadani was one of Ar-Ridha’’s especial people before Ar-Ridha’ was brought (to Khorasan). He was an intelligent and well-versed scholar. He was in charge of the affairs of Ar-Ridha’ . Whatever was brought in from the different areas was first handed to him, before the taking of Ar-Ridha’ to Khorasan. Then, after they brought Abul Hassan to Khorasan, Ibrahim joined Thul-Riasatayn. Thul-Riasatayn established him as one of his closest workers. He used to report the news about Ar-Ridha’ to Thul-Riasatayn and Al-Ma’mun. That is how he got closer to them, and nothing was hidden from them. Al-Ma’mun made him the main guard for Ar-Ridha’ . He did not let anyone visit Ar-Ridha’ , if he himself did not approve of it. He made things terribly difficult for Ar-Ridha’ in his house. No one could talk tohim without the consent of Thul-Riasatayn and Al-Ma’mun. Al-Ma’mun entrusted his son - Al-Abbas to Hisham to train. That is why he was called Abbasid Hisham. Thul-Riasatayn made his real animosity with Abil Hassan Ar-Ridha’ apparent, because Al-Ma’mun respected the Imam more than him.Al-Ma’mun had a nephew whom he loved, and she also loved him. They had thus opened a door from her house to Al-Ma’mun’s court. That nephew was more inclined towards Abil Hassan , and used to gossip about Thul-Riasatayn with Al-Ma’mun. Thul-Riasatayn was informed about this. He went to Al-Ma’mun and said, “It is not proper for the Caliph that a door be opened to his court from the lady’s quarter. Al-Ma’mun had that door closed. It was a current practice for Al-Ma’mun to visit Ar-Ridha’ one day, and the next day Ar-Ridha’ went to see Al-Ma’mun. Abil Hassan’s residence was next to Al-Ma’mun’s. Once, when Ar-Ridha’ entered Al-Ma’mun’s house and saw the shut door, he said, “O Commander of the Faithful! Why is this door shut?” He said, “This was Al-Fadhl’s idea. He did not like it (to be open).” Then Ar-Ridha’ said, “To God We belong and to Him is our return.” What does Al-Fadhl have to do with the Commander of the Faithful and his family?” He asked, “What do you think?” He replied, “Open it and let your nephew visit you. Do not accept what Al-Fadhl forbids or allows.” Then Al-Ma’mun ordered that the door be re-opened and let his nephew enter. Al-Fadhl heard this and became sad."

, the government officials, Al-Fadhl ibn Sahl and his brother. No one, however, granted me permission to quote directly from that book. However, in the following I will present what I have read in that book:And next, praise be to God - the Initiator; the Innovator; the Able; the Subduer; the Watcher of His servants; the Nourisher of all His creatures; to whose Kingdom all things humble themselves; to whose Glory all things yield; to whose Power all things submit; to whose Sovereignty and Greatness all things humble themselves; whose Knowledge encompasses all things and cannot be enumerated; to whom no great person can present himself; and from whose Sight no small person is missed; the One whom the eyes of the viewers cannot see; and the One who cannotbe described by the ones who describe; to Him belongs creating and the rule; and He is the Most Exalted example in the heavens and the Earth. He is Honorable and Wise.And praise be to God who established Islam as our religion. Then He made it noble, great, honored, and respected. He established it as a stable religion that cannot be changed, and as a straight path that directs whoever trots on it not going astray, and whoever abandons it will not be guided. He established light, reasoning, healing and form in it. He sent it down by means of His chosen angels to whomever He chose for Prophethood from the nations which have now gone and made room for others until the Prophethood ended with the appointment of Muhammad al-Mustafa . He ended the Prophethood’s mission with Muhammad and with him ended the messages of the Prophets. And He appointed him due to His Mercy encompassing the people of the Two Worlds; and as one to give glad tidings to the honest believers; and to admonish the lying pagans. This He did to perfect His Proof for the people so that whoever is to be ruined after Truth has become apparent is ruined, and whoever is to survive after Truth has become apparent survives. Indeed God Sees and Knows. And praise be to God who granted the inheritance of the Prophets to the members of his (i.e. Muhammad’s) Holy Household, entrusted them with knowledge and wisdom, established them as the treasury of Divine Leadership and Rule, and made it incumbent (upon all) to love them and hold high their ranks. Then He ordered His Prophet (S) to ask his nation to love them when he said, ‘No reward do I ask of you for this except the love of those near of kin’ And the way they were described as being pure and immaculate (a.s.potless) can be seen in His words, ‘And God only wishes to remove all abomination from you, ye members of the Family, and to make you pure and spotless.’And next, Al-Ma’mun treated the ‘Itra of God’s Prophet (S) with reverence. Al-Ma’mun established the ties of kinship of his Holy Household which had been broken. He returned the family’s affection for each other, and ended their disunion. He bridged the gap that had developed amongst them. Thus, God totally eliminated their animosities and fostered co-existence instead. And now due to his blessedness, care, freedom, and re-establishing family relationships all the hands have become united into one hand. All the various ways of the people havebecome one way, and their words have become the same word. Then all the various thoughts emerged into one. Everyone’s rights were honored and everyone’s inheritance was given to him. He rewarded the good deeds of the good-doers. He honored those who had successfully passed their tests. He established the various ranks of the people in the government according to their religiousness. Then he treated with honor the one who had made progress due to his efforts. He raised his rank and rewarded him. The person we are talking about is just Thul-Riasatayn Al-Fadhl ibn Sahl. Al-Ma’mun noted that Al-Fadhl ibn Sahl is a sincere aid who is steadfast in guarding Al-Ma’mun’s rights, and in expressing Al-Ma’mun’s reasons. Al-Ma’mun noted that Al-Fadhl ibn Sahl is a good teacher for the government officials and is a good leader for the troops. Al-Ma’mun noted that Al-Fadhl ibn Sahl is wise at war; is a good leader for the people; invites the people to Al-Ma’mun’s way and rewards those who honor Al-Ma’mun’s orders. Al-Ma’mun noted that Al-Fadhl ibn Sahl avoids those who do not honor the orders of the Caliph, evade Al-Ma’mun’s orders or disobey him. Al-Ma’mun noted that Al-Fadhl ibn Sahl is the only one to assist Al-Ma’mun. Al-Ma’mun noted that Al-Fadhl ibn Sahl is the healer of those who are ill in their hearts or minds. Not having enough money or not finding a friend to assist him in these affairs will not prevent him from doing so. He does not go astray from the right path due to greed. Fear will not lead him towards others. Rather, he becomes more determined, more steadfast, stronger and wiser when others make trouble and try to spread fear like lightning and thunder. He seriously defends Al-Ma’mun’s rights and invites the people towards him until Thul-Riasatayn defeats the perverse; dulls their swords; cuts off their nails; totally eradicates their majesty from the root; and presses the backs of the atheists to the ground - those who broke their covenants, did not adhere to their covenants with Al-Ma’mun, looked down upon his rights and who were secure from his warnings before. In addition to all of that, as you have been told and heard when recited on the pulpits, the results of the efforts of Thul-Riasatayn in the classes of the pagan nations have been impressive, and God increased the extent of the Muslim lands due to him. Also, what the people of the world have taken from you and delivered to others is clear.Then the gratitude of Thul-Riasatayn for the gallantry of Commander of the Faithful (Al-Ma’mun), and his rising to fulfill his rights, the sacrificesof himself and his brother Abi Muhammad ibn Sahl who was blessed, and Thul-Riasatayn’s praiseworthy politics reached a point which led him ahead of others and he became the most successful. Thus the Commander of the Faithful (Al-Ma’mun) rewarded him with much wealth, property and ornaments, although these could not even equal just one day of his efforts and did not suffice for even one position from the positions he held. However, he abandoned all this due to his abstinence; great determination; his efforts to increase the Muslim’s wealth; abstaining from worldly wealth and looking down on the world; preferring the Hereafter and his extended inclination to the Hereafter. He often asked the Commander of the Faithful (Al-Ma’mun) to accept his resignation and expressed his lack of interest in being the prime minister. This resignation raised his rank near Al-Ma’mun and us (i.e. Ar-Ridha’ ) as God the Honorable the Exalted had made us informed of his viewpoints on the glory of the Muslims and the ruler, and his increased effort to improve the Muslims’ affairs and fight the pagans; plus other things which God had manifested for us (i.e. Ar-Ridha’ ) such as: his sincere intentions; sincerity; wisdom; good management; strong will; high intellect; assisting the Right; guidance; freedom and piety.Then since the Commander of the Faithful (Al-Ma’mun) trusted him and we (i.e. Ar-Ridha’ ) trusted him considering his religiousness, and choosing that in which there lied his good, then we fulfilled his request according to his rank and wrote the book Al-Hiba wal-Shart (the manuscript of which is included later on in this book) for him. We took God and those present there - including members of our household; the army heads; the staff of the court; the judges; the jurists; the jurisprudents; the elite and the masses as witnesses thereto. And the Commander of the Faithful (Al-Ma’mun) deemed it proper to distribute this book (Al-Hiba wal-Shart) in all towns, so that it would be spread (all over) everywhere; all the people would get to know it; it would be read from the pulpits; and a copy of it would be in the possession of every governor and judge. He has asked me to write it, explain its meaning, and it has three chapters as follows:Chapter 1: It describes everything done by Thul-Riasatayn due to which the Most Exalted God has made it incumbent upon us and all the Muslims to honor his rights.Chapter 2: It describes the degree of his progress; the correctness of his deeds; and that no one is allowed to do whatever he wishes to make a stumbling-block for his efforts; and the reasons for that. This is because not anyone of the people who have pledged allegiance to the Commander of the Faithful (Al-Ma’mun) must pledge allegiance to him (Thul-Riasatayn) and his brother. They have the right to remove any obstacles that might get in their way or try to cause corruption against us, them or our friends. This is done so that no one even thinks about opposing them, disobeying them or think of tricks to separate us from each other.Chapter 3: It describes the donations of the Commander of the Faithful (Al-Ma’mun) to Thul-Riasatayn; what he demanded due to his abstinence from this world; his adherence to abstinence; lack of interest in wealth and position being a reason that he has constantly made efforts for the Hereafter and demands enough reward just enough to eliminate any doubts in him. We honored him and granted to him whatever was incumbent upon us to bestow upon him and his brother, and for his abstaining from what we abstained from ourselves. This chapter includes everything that one who is cautious needs to be cautious about.And this is the manuscript of the book:In the Name of God the Beneficent, the Merciful. This is the writing and the conditions of the Commander of the Faithful Abdullah Al-Ma’mun and his successor to the throne Ali ibn Musa Ar-Ridha’ for Thul-Riasatayn Al-Fadhl ibn Sahl on Monday of the (Arabic) month of Ramadhan in the year 201 A.H. (816 A.D.). This is the day on which God perfected the affairs of the government of the Commander of the Faithful (Al-Ma’mun). He concluded the contract for the succession to the throne, had the people clothed in green attire, reached his goal of improving the affairs of the people and overcoming his enemies.On that day we invited you to that in which there lies some reward for you (Thul-Riasatayn) since you have set out to honor the rights of God the Blessed the Sublime; the right of His Prophet (S); the right of the Commander of the Faithful (Al-Ma’mun) and the successor to his throne; the rights of the Hashemites from which it is hoped that the religion will improve and the relations between the Muslims will improve so much that the resulting blessings encompass us and the general public. The other reason is your assistance to me - the Commander of the Faithful(i.e. Al-Ma’mun) - in establishing the rules of the religion and the traditions of the Master of the Messengers (i.e. the Prophet Muhammad (S)); and invitation to both; choosing what is best and destroying the pagans; breaking the idols; and eliminating the rebellions. Also there are other known things that you have done in the town like dismissing the overthrown Caliph; what you did to the one called Asfar with the nickname Abul Saraya; and what you did to the other one who is called Mehdi being related to Muhammad ibn Ja’far ibn Muhammad Talebi and the Khalaji Turks; and what you did to the governors of Tabarestan including Hormoz ibn Shervin; the governor of Daylam; King Mahvars in Kabul; its other king - King Isfahboz; and what you did to Ibn al-Baram; and what you did in Mount Bidar Bandeh, Qarshistan, al-Qoor and its counties; and what you did to the Khaqan in Khorasan, and Maloon Sahib in Mount Tab’bat; and what you did in Kayman and at-taqreqar; and what you did in Erminiyet, Hijaz; and what you did to Sahib As-Sarir and Sahib al-Khazar, and the other battles in al-Maqrib.The salary which we (i.e. Al-Ma’mun and Ar-Ridha’ ) have established for you is an assistance with which we invited you - being one hundred million Dirhams - plus ten million Dirhams income in jewelry and whatever the Caliph has already bestowed upon you. Of course, we know that the worth of one hundred million Dirhams in jewelry is much less than what you deserve. You abandoned this much property when Amin bestowed it upon you, and chose God and His Religion over it. You were grateful to the Commander of the Faithful (Al-Ma’mun) and the successor to his throne. You gave up much property that was your reward and salary, and turned them over to the Muslims so that their treasury would become wealthier. You preferred others over yourself.Now you have asked us for what you are naturally inclined to, and you deserve what is due to you fo your abstinence from this world and these people. This abstinence is so much that now it has left no room for doubt for anyone who doubted whether your efforts are for this world or the Hereafter. And everyone was assured that all your efforts are not for this world, but for the Hereafter. Therefore, we are never needless of people like you. The requests of people like you should never be rejected, even though your demands be such that many blessings are taken away from us. In fact, your requests bring forth a lot of blessings for us. They reduce a lot of our expenditures, and prove that you desire the Hereafter to those who think that you want this position due to your greed for this world, and not the Hereafter.Now I (Al-Ma’mun) will fulfill your request, and assure it to you - strengthened by a covenant with God in which there is no change. I entrust you with the affairs without any hesitation, and appoint you to the rank (of prime minister). Do as you please. There is no one empowered to prevent what you decide to do, or enforce what you disapprove of. We will fend off from you what we would fend off from ourselves. Even if you get tired and rest for a while, you are still honored since your body needs comfort and honoring, too.Then we (Al-Ma’mun and Ar-Ridha’ ) will grant to you during your period of resting what we had given you before, but you donated to others. We will also establish the same amount of salary for your brother Hassan ibn Sahl plus half of his previous salary. This is for your sake, since he made a really good effort in fighting with the rebellious ones, and conquered Iraq twice. He dispersed the Satanic groups and thus religion was strengthened, and consecutive wars ended. He saved us, all the heads of the army and the politicians on the right by using himself.And we (Al-Ma’mun and Ar-Ridha’ ) call God, His angels, the best of the people and all of those who have pledged allegiance to us and promised to be loyal to us as witnesses to what is in this book today and for the future. We establish God as the guarantor. We consider it incumbent upon ourselves to be loyal to the conditions that we have set with no exceptions in public or private. Believers adhere to their covenants. A covenant is binding and we are responsible. The best of the people are those who honor their covenants even when in the position of power. God the Highest said, ‘Fulfill the Covenant of God when ye have entered into it, and break not your oaths after ye have confirmed them; indeed ye have made God your surety; for God knoweth all that ye do.’Al-Hassan ibn Sahl wrote the following down for Al-Ma’mun, “In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful. The Commander of the Faithful (Al-Ma’mun) has made all that is in this book incumbent upon himself and God the Highest is the witness thereto. He is the guarantor. The book is written in his own handwriting in the (Arabic) month of Safar of the year 202 A.H. (816 A.D.) to clearly state what he has granted and the conditions thereon.”And Ar-Ridha’ wrote in it, “In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful. Ali ibn Musa Ar-Ridha’ binds all that which is written in this bookupon himself as stressed here on this day, tomorrow and for as long as he lives. I establish God the Highest as a witness thereto and a guarantor. It suffices for God to be a witness.” And Ar-Ridha’ wrote in his own handwriting, “In this month and this year. (And praise be to God - the Lord of the Two Worlds. And blessings be upon Muhammad and his Household, and greetings be upon them. God suffices for us and He is the best Trustee).”"
ʿUyūn akhbār al-Riḍā,The Source of Traditions on Imam al-Riḍā,Volume 2,Shaykh Muḥammad b. ʿAlī al-Ṣaduq,Dr. Ali Peiravi,"ʿUyūn Akhbār al-Riḍā, also known as ʿUyūn al-Akhbār is a comprehensive Ḥadīth collection focusing on Imam al-Riḍā (as), which is compiled by the renowned Shīʿī scholar, al-Shaykh al-Ṣadūq. The work contains a plethora of Ḥadīths that are either the direct sayings of Imam al-Riḍā (as) or the wisdom he imparted from his forefathers. As one of the references within Shīʿī scholarship, this collection covers an array of subjects, including history, jurisprudence, ethics, and theology. al-Shaykh al-Ṣadūq may have written ʿUyūn Akhbār al-Riḍā after the death of Rukn al-Dawla al-Buwayhī in 366 AH. The writing of this work was inspired by a unique exchange. Sāḥib b. ʿAbbād al-Daylamī, a prominent Shīʿī minister and ruler of the time, penned a poem extolling ʿAlī b. Mūsā al-Riḍā (as) and dedicated it to al-Shaykh al-Ṣadūq. In response, the work was compiled as a reciprocal gift. al-Shaykh al-Ṣadūq stated in his introduction, ""I found no other better gift than this book which is about the infinite knowledge of Imam al-Riḍā (as) to send in return to the two odes of Ibn ʿAbbād.” This text provides readers with a deep understanding of the life and teachings of Imam al-Riḍā, illuminating the comprehensive scope of his wisdom and his contributions to Islamic thought and practice.",Section 1,"Chapter 10 | On The Reasons why Ali ibn Musa Ar-Ridha accepted the succession to the throne from Al-Ma’mun, what Went On,

بِجَنْبِ الْمَأْمُونِ فَقَالَ أُعِيذُكَ بِاللَّهِ يَا أَمِيرَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ أَنْ تُخْرِجَ هَذَا الأَمْرَ الَّذِي جَعَلَهُ اللَّهُ لَكُمْ وَخَصَّكُمْ بِهِ وَتَجْعَلَهُ فِي أَيْدِي أَعْدَائِكُمْ وَمَنْ كَانَ آبَاؤُكَ يَقْتُلُونَهُمْ وَيُشَرِّدُونَهُمْ فِي الْبِلادِ قَالَ الْمَأْمُونُ لَهُ يَا ابْنَ الزَّانِيَةِ وَأَنْتَ بَعْدُ عَلَى هَذَا قَدِّمْهُ يَا حَرَسِيُّ وَاضْرِبْ عُنُقَهُ فَضُرِبَتْ

Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn Ja’far ibn Muhammad ibn Zayd ibn Ali ibn Al-Husayn ibn Ali ibn Abi Talib narrated in Qum in the month of Rajab of the year 339 A.H. (949 A.D.) that Ali ibn Ibrahim informed me on the following through a book in the year 307 A.H. (918 A.D.) in which he wrote on the authority of Yasir - the servant, “Whenever Ar-Ridha’ had a private session, he gathered all his workers - whether young or old - and talked with them and was friendly with them. When Ar-Ridha’ sat down to dine, he invited them all -whether young or old - to sit down at the same tablecloth. He did not leave anyone out. He even invited the horse caretaker and the phlebotomist. One day we were with the Imam and heard the door which connected Al-Ma’mun’s house to Abil Hassan’s house open. Then Ar-Ridha’ told us, “Stand up and disperse.” We stood up. Al-Ma’mun came in with a long letter in his hand. Ar-Ridha’ decided to get up, but Al-Ma’mun swore to him by the right of God’s Prophet (S) - not to stand up. Then he went to Abil Hassan , kissed him and sat down in front of him leaning on the cushion, and read that letter for him. The letter said that we have opened the gates of such and such a castle, have conquered such and such towns, etc. When he finished reading, Ar-Ridha’ asked him, “Does conquering one of the towns of the pagans make you happy?” Al-Ma’mun replied to him, “Is there not happiness in it?” He said, “O Commander of the Faithful! Fear God in the way you deal with the nation of Muhammad and the mission that God has given you, and made you especial in that. You have left the Muslims’ affairs unattended to, and have turned running their affairs over to others who rule over them in ways different from God’s Decrees. You have totally forgotten about these towns, have left the town of the Emigration (Medina) and the site of descension of the revelations where the Emigrants (Muhajerin) and their Helpers (Ansar) were oppressed there. There is no taking into consideration of the believers or the Divine Covenants. The oppressedpeople there are having hard times. They cannot provide for their basic expenses. They find no one to complain to regarding their conditions and they cannot reach you. O Commander of the Faithful! Fear God. Attend to the affairs of the Muslims. Return to the home of the Prophethood and the source of the Emigrants and the Helpers. O Commander of the Faithful! Beware that the ruler of the Muslims is like the main pillar of a tent. Whoever wants to attack the tent captures the main pillar.” Al-Ma’mun asked him , “O my Master! What do you think now?” Ar-Ridha’ replied, “I think that you should leave these towns and return to the place of your father and forefathers. Take care of the affairs of the Muslims. Do not leave them up to someone else. Indeed God the Highest will question you regarding your rule.” Al-Ma’mun stood up and said, “Yes, my Master! You are right!” He went out and ordered everyone to get prepared to go. The news of this reached Thul-Riasatayn. He became really depressed about this, since he was totally in charge of all the affairs; and Al-Ma’mun’s views were not important at all since he did not dare oppose. That is why Al-Ma’mun sought to strengthen himself through Ar-Ridha’ . Then Thul-Riasatayn went to Al-Ma’mun and asked him, “O Commander of the Faithful! What is this order that you have issued?” Al-Ma’mun replied, “My Master Abul Hassan (Ar-Ridha’ ) has ordered me to do so, and it is right.” Thul-Riasatayn said, “O Commander of the Faithful! This is not right. Yesterday you killed your brother and seized the Caliphate (the rule) from him. Your father’s children, all the people of Iraq, your family and all the Arabs are your enemies. Then there is a second issue being that you designated Abil Hassan (Ar-Ridha’ ) as the successor to the throne and took the Caliphate from your own family. The public, the jurists, the scholars and the Abbasids were not in agreement with you. They hate you in their hearts. The best thing to do is to stay in Khorasan until the people’s hearts calm down about this issue, and they slowly get accustomed to you and forget what you did to your brother Muhammad. O Commander of the Faithful! There are elders with whom your father used to consult. You also must seek their advice on this issue. If they agree with this, then go ahead with it.” Al-Ma’mun asked, “Like who?” Thul-Riasatayn replied, “People like Ali ibn (Abi) Imran, Abu Yunus and Al-Joloodi (who had refused to pledge allegiance to Abil Hassan (Ar-Ridha’ ), since they were not pleased with him and were prisoned by Al-Ma’mun for this).” Al-Ma’mun said, “Fine.”The next morning Abul Hassan Ar-Ridha’ went to Al-Ma’mun and said, “O Commander of the Faithful! What did you do?” Al-Ma’mun informed Ar-Ridha’ about what Thul-Riasatayn had said, and ordered that those three people be taken out of prison and brought to him. At first, Ali ibn (Abi) Imran entered. When he saw Ar-Ridha’ sitting next to Al-Ma’mun, he said, “O Commander of the Faithful! I will entrust you to God. Don’t ever let this affair that God has established for you and has made you especial for it, be taken out and placed into the hands of your enemies who were ordered to be killed and were thrown out of their hometowns by your forefathers (referring to Imam Ar-Ridha’ and his forefathers ). Then Al-Ma’mun said, “O bastard! You still think this way? O guard! Behead him.” Then he was beheaded. Then Abu Yunus came in. When he saw Ar-Ridha’ sitting next to Al-Ma’mun he said, “O Commander of the Faithful! This man at your side is an idol that they worship besides God.” Al-Ma’mun said, “O bastard! You still think this way, too? O guard! Behead him.” Then he was beheaded. Then al-Joloodi entered.(When Muhammad ibn Ja’far ibn Muhammad revolted in Medina during the rule of Al-Rashid, Al-Joloodi was sent there with orders to behead Muhammad if he overcame him. He was also ordered to loot the Talibites’ homes of the, to strip their women and take away all their clothing but one article. Al-Joloodi did that. That was the time when Abul Hassan Musa ibn Ja’far was killed. Al-Joloodi reached Abul Hassan Ar-Ridha’’s house. He attacked his house with his troops. Ar-Ridha’ took all the women into the house and stood at the door himself. Al-Joloodi told Abil Hassan , “I must enter and take away in person everything that they possess, as the Commander of the Faithful has ordered this.” Ar-Ridha’ told him, “I will take all of it myself and promise that I will not leave anything behind.” Al-Joloodi, however, did not agree to this and kept trying to do that himself. The Imam promised him and he finally agreed. Then Abal Hassan Ar-Ridha’ went in and took away all their possessions including their earrings, anklets and other ornaments; and handed them over to Al-Joloodi. They took away everything else that was in the house, too.)When Al-Joloodi entered that day, Ar-Ridha’ told Al-Ma’mun, “O Commander of the Faithful! Grant this old man to me. Al-Ma’mun said, “O my Master! This is the same man who did the same to the family ofGod’s Prophet (S) as he did when looting the goods of the women.” Al-Joloodi was looking at Ar-Ridha’ who was talking to Al-Ma’mun and insisting that he be forgiven and be turned over to Ar-Ridha’ . However, he imagined that Ar-Ridha’ was talking against him knowing what he had done. Thus he told Al-Ma’mun, “O Commander of the Faithful! I ask you in the Name of God and due to the services that I have rendered to Al-Rashid that you do not accept what he says.” Then Al-Ma’mun said, “O Abal Hassan (Ar-Ridha’ )! I forgive him but he is swearing that I reject your request.” Then he told Ar-Ridha’ , “No, by God, I will not accept what he says about you. Let him join his friends.” He was taken away and beheaded, too. Then Thul-Riasatayn went to his father Sahl. Al-Ma’mun had already issued orders to ride. However Thul-Riasatayn had refused. Since Al-Ma’mun had killed those three men, Zul-Riasatasyn knew that he was determined to leave. Then Ar-Ridha’ asked him, “O Commander of the Faithful! What did you do about getting ready to go?” Al-Ma’mun said, “O my Master! Please tell them yourself to do that.” Then Abul Hassan went out and loudly announced to the people, “Bring forth the animals.” It was as if he had spread fire amongst the people. The agents brought forth the riding animals. Thul-Riasatayn was still sitting at home. Al-Ma’mun sent someone and called him in and asked why he was sitting in the house. He replied, “O Commander of the Faithful! My sins are innumerable in the sight of the members of your household and the general public. The people blame me for killing your dethroned brother and for pledging allegiance to Ar-Ridha’ . I am not secure from the bad wishers, the jealous ones, and the oppressors who may gossip behind my back before you. Please leave me here in Khorasan and let me run the affairs here.” Then Al-Ma’mun told him, “We are not yet not in need of you. And regarding what you said that they might make trouble for you, you have been tested by us and are known to be a sympathetic counselor. Write whatever form of letter of immunity that you wish to and I will sign it for you to be sure.” Then Thul-Riasatayn went and wrote a letter himself and had it signed by all the scholars. He then brought it to Al-Ma’mun and recited it. Al-Ma’mun granted whatever he had wanted and wrote it in his own handwriting and added to it that he would grant him whatever property, land or power that he desired in the world. Then Thul-Riasatayn said, “It is necessary for Abil Hassan’s (Ar-Ridha’ ) handwriting to be in this letter of immunity. He should accept this as youdid since he is the successor to the throne.” Al-Ma’mun said, “You know that Abal Hassan (Ar-Ridha’ ) made a condition not to interfere in any of our affairs, or say anything. We cannot ask him to do what he does not like to do. Ask him yourself. It is hoped that he does not turn you down.” Then he went and asked for permission to see Abil Hassan (Ar-Ridha’ ). Yasir added, “Ar-Ridha’ told us to go away and we did. Al-Fadhl came in and stood in front of Ar-Ridha’ . After a while, Abul Hassan Ar-Ridha’ raised his head and asked him, “O Al-Fadhl! What do you want?” He said, “O my Master! This is a letter of immunity that the Commander of the Faithful has written for me. It is also best if you could grant me the same as he did, since you are the successor to the throne for the Muslims.” Then Ar-Ridha’ told him, “Read it.” He stood up and recited it, even though it was long. When he finished, Abul Hassan Ar-Ridha’ told him, “O Fadhl! As long as you fear God the Honorable the Exalted, this holds true for you with me.” Yasir added, “The Imam restricted Thul-Riasatayn with what he said.” Then Thul-Riasatayn left. Al-Ma’mun set out and we left along with Ar-Ridha’ . A few days passed. We were at one of the way-stations when Thul-Riasatayn received a letter from his brother Al-Hassan ibn Sahl saying, “I have taken a look at the astrology chart. You will experience the heat of the iron and fire on the Wednesday of such and such a month. I think that you, Ar-Ridha’ and the Commander of the Faithful should go to the bath on that day and you should do a phlebotomy so that blood can flow out of your body and the bad omen that is in you on that day gets removed.” Then Al-Fadhl dispatched someone to Al-Ma’mun and reported this and asked that he accompany him to the bath and also ask Abal Hassan Ar-Ridha’ to do the same. Then Al-Ma’mun wrote to Ar-Ridha’ and asked him to do so. Abal Hassan (Ar-Ridha’ ) wrote him back and said, “I will not go to the bath tomorrow, since just tonight I dreamt of God’s Prophet (S) who told me, ‘O Ali! Do not go to the bath tomorrow. Therefore I do not consider it wise for you or Al-Fadhl to go to the bath.” Al-Ma’mun wrote him back, “O my Master! You are right. God’s Prophet (S) is right. I will not go to the bath, but Al-Fadhl knows best for himself.”Yasir added, “When the sun set and the night came Ar-Ridha’ told us, ‘Say I seek refuge in God from the evil that will descend tonight.’ We started saying that until dawn when Ar-Ridha’ said his prayers. He said, ‘Say I seek refuge in God from the evil that will descend today.’ Thennear dawn, Ar-Ridha’ told me, ‘Go to the roof and see if you can hear anything.’ When I went on up onto the roof, I heard a lot of mourning and crying that was increasing. Then I saw that Al-Ma’mun entered the house through the gate from his house to Abil Hassan’s house and said, ‘O my Master! O Abal Hassan (Ar-Ridha’ )! May God grant you rewards for the calamity that has happened to Al-Fadhl. He had entered the bath when some people attacked him with swords and killed him. They were three in number. One of them was Al-Fadhl’s maternal cousin (his aunt’s son) called Thul-Qalamayn.” Then the troops and the heads of the army who were under the control of Thul-Riasatayn gathered in front of Al-Ma’mun’s house and said, “Al-Ma’mun has tricked him and killed him. We will take revenge.” Then Al-Ma’mun told Ar-Ridha’ , “O my Master! Please consider going out and dispersing them.” Then Ar-Ridha’ got on the horse and told me to get on the horse, too. Then when we got out of the house, Ar-Ridha’ saw that they had gathered there and had made a fire to put the door on fire and burn it. Then Ar-Ridha’ yelled at them and pointed at them with his hand saying, “Disperse!” They all dispersed. The people ran away with such fear that they ran into each other and fell over one another. Whoever Ar-Ridha’ pointed at ran away. Everyone left and no body was left."

This is the time in which I need you. Please take charge of the affairs and help me.” The Imam said, “O Commander of the Faithful (Al-Ma’mun)! You are in charge of running the affairs, and I am in charge of praying.” When Al-Ma’mun left, I (Abul Husayn) asked Ar-Ridha’ , “May God honor you! Why didn’t you accept what he offered?” He replied, “O Aba Husayn! Woe be to you! Are you not at all affected by what has happened?” When the Imam noticed that I was upset about what had happened, he said, “Why are you thinking about this issue? If things happen the way that you think they should, and your position relative to me be the same as it is now, then your salary will be the same as it is now. You will be the same as other people who are near me.”"

Among them we can mention Abu Ali Al-Husayn ibn Ahmad Al-Salami who has written about the events in Khorasan in his book. He wrote:“Thul-Riasatayn Fadhl ibn Sahl was Al-Ma’mun’s minister and the master mind of his affairs. He was a Magus. He embraced Islam by means of Yahya ibn Khalid, and became one of his associates. It has been said that Sahl - the father of Al-Fadhl - embraced Islam by means of (the Abbasid) Al-Mahdi. The Barmakite Yahya ibn Khalid appointed Al-Fadhl to serve Al-Ma’mun. However, Al-Fadhl consolidated his position and prevailed over him, too. He carried out all the affairs according to his own opinion and was called Thul-Riasatayn meaningone with two positions being the prime minister and the head of the army. One day when Al-Ma’mun took over the Caliphate, Al-Fadhl asked one of his companions, “How does what I have done compare with what Abi Muslim did?” He replied, “Abi Muslim turned the Caliphate over from one tribe to another, while what you did was turning it over from one brother to another. You know best what the difference is.” Then Al-Fadhl ibn Sahl said, “I will turn it over from one tribe to another one, too.” He then advised Al-Ma’mun to establish Ali ibn Musa Ar-Ridha’ as the successor to the throne instead of his brother al-Mo’taman. Ali ibn Musa Ar-Ridha’ was brought to Khorasan by Raja ibn Abi ad-Dhahhaq in the year 200 A.H. (814 A.D.) by way of Basra and Fars. Al-Ma’mun’s daughter was married off to Ar-Ridha’ . When the news of this reached the Abbasids in Baghdad, it was harsh on them. Thus they pledged allegiance to Ibrahim ibn AL-Mahdi as the Caliph. De’bel ibn Khoza’ee said the following about him:O troops! Do not despairTake your gifts and do not danderSoon will he grant you a beautiful maidenWho has both pleased the beardless youth and the gray-hairedAnd the musical instruments of your pimpsThey will not throw them in a bag and tie it up somewhereThus he provides his companions with the means of subsistenceThe Caliph whose Book is the Barbat”This was because Ibrahim ibn Al-Mahdi was very much interested in playing the lute and was an alcoholic. When the news reached Al-Ma’mun, he realized that Al-Fadhl ibn Sahl had misguided him, and given him bad advice. Therefore, he left Marv heading towards Iraq with a plot to kill Al-Fadhl. He was killed by Qalib - Al-Ma’mun’s maternal uncle - in a bath in Sarakhs in the (Arabic) month of Sha’ban of the year 203 A.H. (818 A.D.). Then Al-Ma’mun plotted to kill Ali ibn Musa Ar-Ridha’ . Finally he poisoned him on an occasion when Ar-Ridha’ had become ill. Then Ar-Ridha’ died. Al-Ma’mun ordered that the Imam be buried in Sanabad next to the grave of Harun Al-Rashid. This happened in the (Arabic) month of Safar in the year 203 A.H. (818 A.D.)when he was 52 years old. Some people have said that this happened to the Imam at the age of 55. This is what Abu Ali Al-Husayn ibn Ahmad al-Salami has narrated in his book. However, what seems right to me is that Al-Ma’mun appointed him as the successor to the throne due to a covenant he had made with God as was mentioned before. However, Al-Fadhl ibn Sahl did not ever stop his animosity. He despised Ar-Ridha’ and did not like him to be the successor to the throne. This was because Al-Fadhl had been raised by the Barmakites. Ar-Ridha’ was forty-nine and a half years old when he died in the year 203 A.H. (818 A.D.) as I have documented in this book."

See whom you trust and introduce them to me to appoint as the governor of a few of the towns in which there is rebellion against us.” The Imam told him, “Honor your covenant with me, and I will honor my covenant with you. My condition for accepting the succession to the throne was that I will not interfere in any of the affairs. I will neither issue any orders, nor will I admonish anyone. I will not remove anyone from office, neither will I appoint anyone. I will not dispatch anyone for any affair. This I will do until God takes me away before you. I swear by God that I have not made any plans for the Caliphate in my mind. I was in Medina where I went around on my own animals. The people there and other people just asked me for the fulfillment of their needs. I fulfilled whatever I possibly could. Thus to me they were just like my uncles. My letters to anyone anywhere were honored. You have not added any blessings to what God has already granted to me.” Then Al-Ma’mun said, “Fine. I will honor my covenant with you.”"

Upon entering (his home), they told him that they had come there regarding a private affair and asked to see him in private. Then Al-Fadhl brought out a letter in which there were pledges to emancipate and divorce which cannot be broken and there is no set expiation for breaking them. They said, “We have come toyou to say what is right and is the truth. We know that the rule belongs to you. O son of the Prophet! We know that it is your right. We have in our minds the same things that we express in words. We swear by the emancipation of our slaves and divorcing of our wives - that which cannot be replaced by the payment of any expiation - and that we go on the Hajj pilgrimage thirty times in bare feet, that we are determined to kill Al-Ma’mun and turn over the rule to you so that you can get back what is rightfully yours.” However, Ar-Ridha’ paid no attention to them, and even blamed them and cursed them. He told them, “You have not been grateful and have also endangered your life. I am not in agreement with you either.” When Al-Fadhl and Hisham heard this, they realized that they had made a big mistake. They decided to go see Al-Ma’mun after hearing what Ar-Ridha’ had told them. They told Ar-Ridha’ , “We said this in order to test you.” Ar-Ridha’ told them, “You are lying. You have in your minds the same thing that you expressed in words. However, you did not find me in agreement with your wishes.” Then when they went to see Al-Ma’mun they said, “O Commander of the Faithful! We went to see Ar-Ridha’ and we talked to him trying to find out what he thinks about you.” And Al-Ma’mun said, “You succeeded.” When they left Al-Ma’mun, Ar-Ridha’ visited him in private and let him know what had been said and recommended that he protect himself against them. When he heard this from Ar-Ridha’ , Al-Ma’mun realized that Ar-Ridha’ was honest."

Muhammad ibn Sayyar quoted on the authority of their fathers, on the authority of Al-Hassan ibn Ali Al-Askari , on the authority of his father Ali ibn Muhammad , on the authority of his father Muhammad ibn Ali that when Ali ibn Musa Ar-Ridha’ was appointed as the successor to the throne by Al-Ma’mun, it did not rainfor some time. Some of the people close to Al-Ma’mun and those biased against Ar-Ridha’ said, “See that God has withheld rain from us since Ali ibn Musa came to us and was designated as the successor to the throne.” The word got around to Al-Ma’mun and it was unpleasant for him. He told Ar-Ridha’ , “It has not rained. Please pray to God the Honorable the Exalted to send down rain for the people.” Ar-Ridha’ said, “Fine.” Al-Ma’mun asked, “When will you do that?” It was Friday. Ar-Ridha’ replied, “On Monday. I saw my grandfather - God’s Prophet (S) - in my dreams along with the Commander of the Faithful (Imam Ali ). The Prophet (S) said, O my son! Wait until Monday. Then go to the desert and pray for rain. God the Highest will send down rain. Inform the people regarding your rank among them which God shows you but the people are unaware of. Thus they will be able to recognize you and become more knowledgeable about you; and recognize your rank and credibility near your Lord - the Honorable the Exalted.”On Monday, Ar-Ridha’ went to the desert. The people came out to watch. He climbed up the pulpit, praised God and glorified Him. Then he said, “O God! O Lord! Thee glorified the rightfulness of us - the Members of the Holy Household, so that the people ask us for help according to Thy decree hoping to receive Thy Nobility and Thy Mercy. They expect Thy Kindness and Blessings. Then please send them rain - a bountiful rain, with extensive coverage, immediately and unharmful. After they leave, please let it start to rain where they are watching from, and from the time they get back home.”The narrator added, “By the One who rightfully appointed Muhammad to the post of Prophethood! At once the wind started to blow, clouds appeared, there was a storm of thunder and lightening, and the people started to move as if they were trying to escape from the rain. Ar-Ridha’ said, ‘O people! Be calm. These clouds are not for you. They are going towards such and such a town.’ The clouds disappeared and it did not rain. Then another cloud appeared along with thunder and lightening. Again the people moved. Ali ibn Musa Ar-Ridha’ said, ‘Be calm. This one is not for you either. It is going to such and such a town to rain.’ Many clouds came and disappeared until the tenth. And for each of them Ali ibn Musa Ar-Ridha’ said, ‘This is not for you. It is for such and such a town. Do not move. Stay calm. Do not cause any disturbance.’ Then the eleventh cloud appeared. This time the Imam said, ‘This isthe cloud which God the Honorable the Exalted has appointed for you. Therefore, praise Him for the Nobility He has granted to you. Stand up and go home. This cloud will stay above your head. It will not rain until you reach home. Then it will rain with so many blessings that is expected of God’s Mercy, and according to His Nobility.’ He came down from the pulpit and the people left. The cloud remained there and it did not rain until all the people got close to their homes. Then came the downpour and the valleys, the pools, the lagoons and the waterless deserts all got filled up. Then the people began to congratulate the son of God’s Prophet (S) for the dignities bestowed upon him by God the Honorable the Exalted.Then Ar-Ridha’ went back amongst them with a large crowd present. He said, “O people! Fear God regarding God’s Blessings. Do not drive away His Blessings from yourselves by committing sins, but make them extended by obeying Him. Thank Him for His bounties and consecutive grants. Make them continuous and know that you thank none but God the Highest.And after belief in God and confessing to the righteousness of the friends of God from amongst the Members of the Holy Household of Muhammad - the Prophet of God , God likes it more that you help other believers in their worldly affairs, since this world is a passage-way to reach their Lord’s Paradise. Whoever does so is amongst the especial servants of God the Blessed the Sublime. God’s Prophet (S) said that it is not proper for the intelligent to deny the nobility of God, not to ponder over this fact and to not act accordingly. One should think about it and act upon it. They told God’s Prophet (S), “So and so was ruined since he had committed such and such a sin.” The Prophet (S) replied, “No. It is not so. He was saved. God will end his deeds up with a good ending, forgive all his sins and convert them all to good deeds since once he was going somewhere and noticed that a believer’s private part was visible, but he did not realize it himself. He covered him up in such a way that the man himself did not notice that, fearing that he might get shy if he notices it. They went along together until they reached a valley where the man realized what his companion had done for him. Then he said, “May God grant you a plentiful reward! May God make you end up in honor. May He not hold a serious Reckoning for you!” And God fulfilled his prayer. That is how God granted that servant a good ending due to theprayers of the above-mentioned believer. This is what God’s Prophet (S) said about someone who was said to have been ruined. He repented and did good deeds. Not even seven days had passed, when some people attacked the vicinity of Medina and stole some things. God’s Prophet (S) sent a group of people to pursue them. This person was among those sent and got martyred.”Imam Muhammad ibn Ali ibn Musa said, “God the Blessed the Sublime increased the blessings of the towns due to the prayers of Ar-Ridha’ . One of Al-Ma’mun’s companions was hoping to be appointed as the successor to the throne instead of Ar-Ridha’ . There was a group of people around Al-Ma’mun who were all jealous of Ar-Ridha’ . One of them told Al-Ma’mun, “O Commander of the Faithful! Take refuge in God! Don’t end the era of the Caliphate of the Abbasids in this way, and be known in history as the one who terminated the Abbasid dynasty. Ruling is a source of honor and great pride for the Abbasids. You will be the cause of its termination in this family and its continuation in the family of Ali. Thus you yourself will harm yourself and your family. Although this magician who is born of a witch (referring to Ar-Ridha’ ) was not known, you yourself have made him famous and dear. He was forgotten, but you have granted him fame. He was nothing, but you made him famous all over the world due to the rain that fell due to his prayers. I am really afraid that he and his magic might take away the blessing of the Caliphate from you, get in power and turn the people against you. If so, can you find anyone who has committed a similar crime against himself and the rule as you have?”Then Al-Ma’mun said, “This man is secretly inviting the people to himself, while I have appointed him as my successor to the throne so that he would invite the people to follow me and attest to my Caliphate and ruling by his acceptance of the post of the successor to the throne; so that those who had believed in him would doubt him and realize that whatever he had claimed - whether a little or a lot - was false. They should realize that the rule is for me. I was afraid to leave him alone, since he might have created such a gap that I could not fill. I thought that Ar-Ridha’ might bring about a calamity for me which I could not tolerate. Now that I have established him as the successor to the throne, I realize that I have made a mistake. I have raised him up to such a high position that I have placed myself at the verge of destruction. Now it isnot proper to neglect his case. We must lower his rank in the eyes of the masses in such a way that they think he does not deserve to hold this rank. Then we will make plans to remove the afflictions from us.”That man said, “O Commander of the Faithful! Please leave arguing with him (Ar-Ridha’ ) to me. I will shut him and his followers up in such a way that they will stutter. If I have no fear of Your Majesty myself, I will reduce his rank and make his inadequacy as your successor to the throne that you have established for him publicly known.” Al-Ma’mun said, “Nothing is better than this for me.” The man said, “Gather together a group of the people from all over the country including the heads of the army, the judges and the chosen jurists, and I will make his shortcomings apparent in their presence. This is like taking back the position that you have placed him in, and they have recognized it properly and blamed you for doing so.”Al-Ma’mun gathered together all the elite among the people in a meeting and seated Ar-Ridha’ in the post of the successor to the throne in front of himself which he had prepared for him. Then the commissionaire who had promised to humiliate Ar-Ridha’ said to him, “Much is said by the people about you. They boast about you so much that you yourself would denounce it, if you heard what they say. The first thing I would like to consider is the praying for rain. You prayed and it rained. However, even if you did not pray, it always rains a few times each year. This is a common happening, while they have considered it to be a miracle done by you. With this miracle they have proved that you are unique and there is no one else like you. It, however, was the Commander of the Faithful (Al-Ma’mun) - may God reward him - and whom no one is superior to who is the one who granted you the post of successor to the throne, and has placed you in the position that you know of. Thus it is not right for you to acknowledge the lies they have spread around about you, while its burden will be upon the Commander of the Faithful.” Then Ar-Ridha’ said, “I will not hinder God’s servants from expressing the blessings that God has granted them. I do not express happiness over my characteristics. And when you said that the ruler Al-Ma’mun has established me in this position you should know that it is not him, rather it was God who established the honest Joseph as the treasurer of the king of Egypt. And you well know the story of those two. When the man heard this, he became angry and said, “O son of Musa! You havegone beyond your limits and have exceeded your rank. God has destined a time for it to rain. It rains at that time without any delay. You have considered it to be your miracle, and are proud of it. You consider it to be a sign of your power as if you have done something like what Abraham - the friend of God - did when he held the heads of the birds in his hands and placed their parts that were all mixed up atop the mountain. They rushed flying away to join up with their heads, and flew away by God’s permission. Then bring these two lions to life and make them overcome me, if you can and if you are telling the truth. If you do this, then it can be considered a miracle, since it often rains. You do not deserve to claim that it rained since you prayed since others also prayed along with you.” The man was pointing at the picture of two lions which were on the design across from Al-Ma’mun’s couch.” Then Ali ibn Musa became angry, yelled at the two lions and said, “Tear up this bastard! Do not leave any traces of him.” The picture of the lions turned into two live lions, attacked the man, broke his bones, ate him all up and licked up his blood. All who were present were watching and not believing their eyes. When the lions got finished with him, they turned to Ar-Ridha’ and pointing at Al-Ma’mun asked, “O Friend of God on His earth! Do you order us to do what we did to him?” Al-Ma’mun fainted when he heard this. Then Ar-Ridha’ told the lions, “Stay where you are.” They stopped. Then Ar-Ridha’ said, “Bring some rose water and spray it on him.” The servants brought some rose water and sprayed it on him. Then he regained his consciousness. Again the lions said, “Let us finish him up and send him near his friend.” Ar-Ridha’ said, “No. Indeed God the Honorable the Exalted has plans for him which will be completed by Himself. They asked, “Then what do you order us to do?” He said, “Return to your place and get back as you were.” The two lions returned to where they were before and again became pictures of lions on the design.Al-Ma’mun said, “Praise be to God who sufficed me against the evils of Homayd ibn Mehran - that is the man who was destroyed.” Then he told Ar-Ridha’ , “O son of the Prophet of God! This rule belongs to your grandfather - the Prophet of God . Do you want me to resign and turn it over to you?” Ar-Ridha’ said, “If that is what I wanted, I would not have asked you for it since God the Highest has designated other creatures to obey me as you saw in the case of the two lions. And there isonly a group of those who have gone astray who rebel. Although they have only been at loss in what they gained, there is a reason for what the Honorable the Exalted has planned. And He has ordered me not to object to you and be at your service no matter what you say, just as He appointed Joseph to act according to the will of the Pharaoh of Egypt. Thereafter, Al-Ma’mun humbled himself before Ar-Ridha’ until Al-Ma’mun did to Ar-Ridha’ what he did (i.e. poisoned the Imam ).”"
ʿUyūn akhbār al-Riḍā,The Source of Traditions on Imam al-Riḍā,Volume 2,Shaykh Muḥammad b. ʿAlī al-Ṣaduq,Dr. Ali Peiravi,"ʿUyūn Akhbār al-Riḍā, also known as ʿUyūn al-Akhbār is a comprehensive Ḥadīth collection focusing on Imam al-Riḍā (as), which is compiled by the renowned Shīʿī scholar, al-Shaykh al-Ṣadūq. The work contains a plethora of Ḥadīths that are either the direct sayings of Imam al-Riḍā (as) or the wisdom he imparted from his forefathers. As one of the references within Shīʿī scholarship, this collection covers an array of subjects, including history, jurisprudence, ethics, and theology. al-Shaykh al-Ṣadūq may have written ʿUyūn Akhbār al-Riḍā after the death of Rukn al-Dawla al-Buwayhī in 366 AH. The writing of this work was inspired by a unique exchange. Sāḥib b. ʿAbbād al-Daylamī, a prominent Shīʿī minister and ruler of the time, penned a poem extolling ʿAlī b. Mūsā al-Riḍā (as) and dedicated it to al-Shaykh al-Ṣadūq. In response, the work was compiled as a reciprocal gift. al-Shaykh al-Ṣadūq stated in his introduction, ""I found no other better gift than this book which is about the infinite knowledge of Imam al-Riḍā (as) to send in return to the two odes of Ibn ʿAbbād.” This text provides readers with a deep understanding of the life and teachings of Imam al-Riḍā, illuminating the comprehensive scope of his wisdom and his contributions to Islamic thought and practice.",Section 1,"Chapter 12 | On the Plans of Al-Ma’mun for Fending off the People From the Meetings of Ar-Ridha , Belittling him, and on the Cursing of Al-Ma’mun",Ḥadīth #1,1 -

may God be pleased with them - on the authority of Ali ibn Ibrahim ibn Hashem quoted on the authority of his father, on the authority of Abdul Salam ibn Salih al-Harawi. The following was also narrated by Abu Muhammad Ja’far ibn Nu’aym ibn Shathan - may God be pleased with him - on the authority of Ahmad ibn Idris, on the authority of Ibrahim ibn Hashem, on the authority of Abdul Salam ibn Salih al-Harawi.Al-Ma’mun was informed that Abal Hassan Ali ibn Musa Ar-Ridha’ had held speech meetings, and the people were fascinated by his knowledge. Then Al-Ma’mun ordered his commissionaire Muhammad ibn Amr al-Toosi to fend off the people from attending the Imam’s meetings. He also called Ar-Ridha’ in. When Al-Ma’mun saw Ar-Ridha’ , he scolded and belittled him. Abul Hassan Ar-Ridha’ left there in an angry state. He was moving his lips and saying, “I swear by the right of al-Mustafa (referring to the Prophet Muhammad (S)), al-Murtadha (referring to Ali ibn Abi Talib ) and the Principal of all Ladies (referring to the Blessed Lady Fatima ) that I will curse him in such a way so as to remove the Honorable the Exalted God’s protection andsupport from him so much that the dogs of this town will throw him out of here and belittle him and the chosen, the regular members of his court. Then Ar-Ridha’ went home and asked for some water to make ablutions. He made ablutions and said two units of prayers. Then in the second unit when it was time to say the hands raised-up supplications (Qunut), he said, “O God! O the Possessor of the Absolute Power, Extensive Mercy, Consecutive Blessings and Continued Good! O the One for whose characteristics there can be no examples cited! O the One for whose similitude there can be no examples cited! O the One whom no assisted ones can overcome! O the One who has created and provided sustenance; revealed and made eloquent; created and guided; destined and honored; organized and perfected; designed and beautified! O the One who has provided for proofs so perfect; blessings so complete; rewards so plentiful! O the One who is at such a zenith of Grandeur that it is beyond the ability of the viewers to see! O the One who is at such a deep level of Delicacy that it is beyond the ability of the thoughts to understand! O the One who is the Only one to rule, and there is no one to compete with You in the Domain of Thy Kingdom; O the One who is Unique in Greatness and there is no one to compete with His Almightiness! O the One due to whose Grandeur the minds of the intelligent ones are at a loss, and the eyes of the onlookers have lost their sight before seeing Him! O the Knower of the thoughts of the mystics! O the Witness to the viewing of those who see! O the One for whom the faces have fallen down in prostration due to His Might; and the heads have bowed down due to His Majesty; and the hearts have beaten fearing His appalling presence; and the veins of the neck strongly pulsate due to fearing Him. O the Initiator! O the Innovator! O the Powerful! O the Impenetrable! O the Sublime! Send Blessings upon the Prophet (S) as You honored the prayers for sending blessings upon him. Take my revenge against those who have oppressed me, belittled me, and have fended off the Shiites from my door. Make him taste the bitterness of humiliation and abasement as they made me taste it. Fend him off from the Threshold of Mercy as filth and contamination is fended off!”Abu Salt Abdul Salam ibn Salih al-Harawi said, “The quake shook the town before he had finished saying his prayers. The whole town was in turmoil. There was loud screaming and crying heard. There was a lot of dirt and dust. I did not move until my Master had finished saying hisprayers. Then Ar-Ridha’ told me, “O Aba Salt! Go to the roof and look around. There you will see a hustler who incites the rebels. She is wearing dirty clothes. The people of this town call her Samanah since she is dumb and rude. She is using a piece of cane on which she has tied a piece of red cloth and uses it as her flag. She tries to make an army out of the rebels, lead them and guide the rebels to attack Al-Ma’mun’s palace and the houses of the army heads.”I went up onto the roof and looked around. I could only see people with sticks in their hands and others with broken heads. I saw Al-Ma’mun leave the Shahjan Palace wearing armor and running away. I saw nothing more but noted that the apprentice of the phlebotomist threw a rock from the roof hitting Al-Ma’mun on the head. His helmet fell off and his head broke. His skull got so much injured that it seemed as if his brain was about to fall out. One of those who recognized Al-Ma’mun told the person who had thrown the rock, “Woe be to you! This is the Commander of the Faithful!” I heard Samanah tell him, “Shut up you bastard! Today is not the day to treat the people according to their ranks. If he was really the Commander of the Faithful, he would not have made pimps masters of virgins. Then they forced Al-Ma’mun and his troops out of town with the utmost degradation."

Who has said it?” The Imam replied, “One of our youth.” Al-Ma’mun said, “Please tell me the best poems about hiding secrets.” He said,I am used to forgetting secretsso that I do not spread them around.Then guard the secrets you know by forgetting them.I fear that I might remember itAnd my heart may spread it around.It is probable that one does not divulge a secret, but so oftenIt comes to his mind that he cannot bear to keep it imprisoned!Then Al-Ma’mun said, “What would you say if you want the people to throw dirt over a book?” The Imam replied, “I would say: ‘Tarrab.” Al-Ma’mun said, “What if it is from ‘al-Sahha?” He replied, “Sahe.” He asked, “What about ‘Tayn?” He replied, “‘Tayyan.” Then Al-Ma’mun told his servant, “Pour dirt over this writing and fold it. Place it in clay and seal it. Then send it to Al-Fadhl ibn Sahl. Take three hundred thousand Dirhams from him for Abil Hassan .”The author of this book (a.s.heikh Sadooq) - may God be pleased with him - said, “What Ar-Ridha’ accepted from Al-Ma’mun is similar to what the Prophet (S) accepted from the kings, and is similar to what Al-Hassan ibn Ali accepted from Mo’awiya, and the other Immaculate Imams accepted from the Caliphs. It is proper for one to accept things when the whole world belongs to him and they confiscate it all, but return some of it to him.”"

They took us to Al-Ma’mun. We benefited from food, drinks, perfumes and a lot of money in his paradise-like house. Al-Ma’mun bestowed me upon Ar-Ridha’ . When I went to his house, I lost all those benefits. A woman was hired as our teacher. She woke us up at night to pray. This was really hard on us and we all wished we could leave there. Then he donated me to your grandfather Abdullah ibn Abbas. When I went to his house, it was as if I had gone to Heaven.”Al-Sowli added, “I have never seen any woman more generous and intelligent than my grandmother. She died in the year 270 A.H. (882 A.D.) after living nearly one hundred years. The people often asked her about Ar-Ridha’ . She replied, “I do not remember anything about him except that he used to evaporate Indian aloes-wood, and then put on rose water and musk. He always said his morning prayer on time at the beginning of the time to pray. Then he prostrated and did not raise his head from that state until sunrise. He would then get up and go to attend to the needs of the people or ride. No one was able to raise his voice in his house - no matter whom he was. He always spoke gently and slowly with the people.My grandfather always sought blessings on account of this female slave. On the same day that she was donated to him, he made a covenant with her to set her free after his death. Once when my grandfather’s maternal uncle, who was a poet called Al-Abbas ibn al-Ahnaf, went to see him and saw her he became interested in her. He told my grandfather, “Can you give her to me?” My grandfather said, “She has been designated to be set free after my death.” Then Al-Abbas ibn al-Ahnaf said,O Qadr! Deceit got adorned by your name being deceitHowever, the world mistreated him who well did you treat."

He cited all his words, answers and similitude from the Qur’an. He read the Qur’an completely once every three days. He used to say, “I can read all the way through the Qur’an even faster if I wish. But in the way I read it now, I ponder over the meanings and on the occasions in which the verses have been revealed, and the time of their revelation. That is why it takes three whole days and nights.” One of his famous sayings is, “Minor sins are the road to major sins. Whoever does not fear God when he commits a minor sin will not fear Him when committing a major sin. Even if God had not admonished the people regarding Heaven and Hell, it was obligatory for the people to obey Him and stay away from disobeying Him. This is due to the nobility and kindness that He has bestowed upon them and having brought them into existence from being non-existent which they did not deserve!”"

Al-Ansari, on the authority of Raja ibn Abil Zah’hak, “Al-Ma’mun sent me in person to bring Ali ibn Musa from Medina. He ordered me to take him there by way of Basra, Ahwaz and Fars, but not by way of Qum. He ordered me to personally accompany and guard him day and night the whole way, until we reached our destination. I was constantly with him all the way from Medina to Marv. I swear by God that I have never seen any man more God-fearing than him, or anyone who remembers God as often as he does at all times, or fear God the Exalted the Honorable more than he does. He said his morning prayer as soon as the morning arrived. Then he sat down where he prayed and praised God, glorified Him, said that God is the Greatest and sent blessings upon the Prophet (S) until sunrise. Then he prostrated and remained in that state until the sun came up. He then got up and attended to the needs of the people and spoke with them. He advised them until the approach of noon. Then he made ablutions and returned to where he prayed. At noon he said six units of prayers. He recited, ‘In the Name of God, Most Gracious, Most Merciful. Praise be to God, the Cherisher and Sustainer of the world; Most Gracious, Most Merciful; Master of the Day of Judgment. Thee do we worship, and Thine aid we seek. Show us the straight way, the way of those on whom Thou hast bestowed Thy Grace, those whose (portion) is not wrath, and who go not astray.’ and continued with (the verses), ‘Say: O ye that reject Faith! I worship not that which ye worship, Nor will ye worship that which I worship. And I will not worship that which ye have been wont to worship, nor will ye worship that which I worship. To you be your Way, and to me mine.’ In the first unit, he recited the Chapter ‘Al-Fatiha and followed it with (the verse), ‘Say: He is God, the One and Only; God, the Eternal, Absolute; He begetteth not, nor is He begotten; And there is none like unto Him’ in the second unit. He recited likewise in the other four units and said the Salam after each two units. In each one, he said the Qunut in the second unit after reading the above verses and before bowing down. After saying each two units, he said the ‘Azan again and said another two units of prayers.Then he recited the Iqamah and said his noon prayers. When he finished, he recited God’s glorifications, praises, ‘God is the Greatest’,‘There is no god but God’ for as many times as God had willed. He then prostrated and expressed his gratitude to God by saying ‘Thanks be to God’ one hundred times. Once he finished his prostrations and lifted his head up, he stood up and performed another six units of prayers.In each unit, he recited (the verse), ‘In the Name of God, Most Gracious, Most Merciful. Praise be to God, the Cherisher and Sustainer of the world; Most Gracious, Most Merciful; Master of the Day of Judgment. Thee do we worship, and Thine aid we seek. Show us the straight way, The way of those on whom Thou hast bestowed Thy Grace, those whose (portion) is not wrath, and who go not astray.’ He continued with the verse, ‘Say: He is God, the One and Only; God, the Eternal, Absolute; He begetteth not, nor is He begotten; And there is none like unto Him.’ He said the ‘Salam after each two units. In each one, he said the ‘Qunut in the second unit after reading the above verses and before bowing down. After saying each two units, he said the ‘Azan again and said another two units of recommendable (‘Nafilah) prayers. He said the ‘Qunut in the second unit, and after finishing the two units he stood up and started to say his afternoon prayers. When he finished saying his afternoon prayers, he sat down there and recited God’s glorifications, praises, ‘God is the Greatest’, ‘There is no god but God’ as many times as God had willed. He then prostrated and expressed his gratitude to God by saying ‘Thanks be to God’ one hundred times. When the sun set, he made ablutions again and said three units of evening prayers along with the ‘Azan, ‘Iqamah and ‘Qunut in the second unit after reciting the verses and before bowing down. After finishing his prayers, he sat down there and recited God’s glorifications in the same manner as expressed above. He then prostrated. When he finished his prostrations, he lifted his head up, but did not talk to anyone until he said four units of recommendable prayers (nafila) for the evening. In each two units, he said the ‘Qunut in the second unit after reading the verses and before bowing down. He also finished each two units by saying the ‘Salams. After reciting the ‘Al-Fatiha in the first unit, he recited the verse ‘Al-Jahd (of the Qur’an), ‘Say: O ye that reject Faith!…’. After reciting the Al-Fatiha in the second unit, he recited the verses ‘Say: He is God, the One and Only; God, the Eternal, Absolute; He begetteth not, nor isHe begotten; And there is none like unto Him’ as he did in the rest of the units. Then he sat down after he had said the Salam and recited the glorifications following his prayers as much as God had willed. He then ate and rested until about one-third of the night was gone. He then got up and said four units of night prayer. He said the Qunut in the second unit after reading the verses and before bowing down. When he finished, he sat down there and mentioned the Exalted the Honorable God, glorifications, praises, ‘God is the Greatest’, ‘There is no god but God’ as many times as God had willed. He then prostrated and expressed his gratitude to God. He then went to sleep and woke up when two thirds of the night had passed. He brushed his teeth while reciting God’s glorifications, praises, ‘God is the Greatest’, ‘There is no god but God’ and asking for repentance. He then made ablutions and stood up to say night prayers. He said four sets of two units of night prayers. In the first unit of each prayer, he recited the verse Al-Fatiha once and recited the verse ‘Say: He is God, the One and Only; God, the Eternal, Absolute; He begetteth not, nor is He begotten; And there is none like unto Him’ thirty times. He also said four units of Ja’far ibn Abi Talib prayers as two sets of two units. He said the Qunut in the second unit of each set, before bowing down and after saying the glorifications. He considered it a part of the night prayer. He then stood up and said the other two units of prayers. In the first unit he recited the Al-Fatiha and recited the Sura of Mulk.In the second unit, he recited the ‘Al-Fatiha and recited the Sura of ad-Dahr (No. 76).

He narrated for them a lot of traditions on the authority of his father , on the authority of his forefathers , on the authority of Ali , on the authority of God’s Prophet (S). When I took Ar-Ridha’ to Al-Ma’mun, Al-Ma’mun asked me about how he had been along the way. I told him what I had seen of him in days and at nights, during his traveling and staying. Then Al-Ma’mun told me, “O Ibn Abil Dhahhak! This is the best person on the Earth with the best deeds and the best worshipping. However, do not tell anyone what you have seen of him, so that no one can recognize his nobility unless he hears it directly from me. I seek help from God to do what I intend to do - that is to raise his rank and spread around his fame.”"

I asked the prison guard for permission to visit. He said, “There is no way for you to visit him.” I asked him, “Why?” He said, “It is because the Imam says one-thousand units of prayers in each twenty-four hours. He only stops to pray for a short time early at daybreak, before the end of the day near dusk, and at times of the yellowness of the sun. Even at these times, he sits at the place where he prays and chants for his Lord.” Then I said, “Please ask him to grant me permission to visit him.” The prison guard sought his permission and I went to see the Imam at the appointed time. He was sitting where he prayed and was thinking. I asked the Imam , “O son of God’s Prophet! What is this that the people have spread around about you?” He asked, “What is it?” I said, “They say that you claim that the people are your slaves.” He said, “O God! The Creator of the heavens and the Earth! You are aware of the invisible and the visible world. You are a witness that I have never said this. I have never heard any of my forefathers say this. You are aware of the oppressions imposed upon us by these people. And this is one such caseof oppression.” Then he faced me and said, “O Abdul Salam! If they are right about their claim that the people are all our slaves, then have them tell you from whom we have bought them.” I said, “O son of God’s Prophet! You are right.” Then Ar-Ridha’ said, “O Abdul Salam! Do you deny what the Sublime God has made incumbent upon you in regards to our Mastery as others do?” I said, “I take refuge in God! No. I bear witness to your Mastery.”"

He never stretched his legs out in front of anyone. He never leaned back in front of anyone. I never saw him reproach any of his servants or agents. I never saw him spit. I never saw him burst into loud laughter. Rather he would smile gently. When everyone left and they spread the tablecloth out for him to dine on, he called every one of his servants and agents - even the door-keeper to dine with him. He slept very little in the daytime. He was awake most of the time. He stayed up a lot at night - from the beginning of the night till early morning. He fasted a lot. He always fasted for at least three days each month. He used to say, “This fasting is like fasting all year long.” He often did good deeds and gave charity in secret. He did most of this in the darkness of the night. If anyone claims that he has seen anyone as noble as him , do not believe him.”"

Ahmad ibn Idris quoted on the authority of Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn Yahya ibn Imran al-Ash’ari, on the authority of Abul Khayr Salih ibn Abi Hammad Ar-Razi, on the authority of Ishaq ibn Hammad ibn Zayd, “Yahya ibn Aktham al-Qadhi brought us all into one room and told us, ‘Al-Ma’mun has ordered me to bring together a group of experts on traditions, and some of the rhetoricians and theoreticians. I have brought together forty men from these two classes. I took them with me and told them to wait at the door to inform Al-Ma’mun’s gate-keeper about their arrival. They stayed there until Al-Ma’mun was informed about their arrival. Al-Ma’mun granted them permission to come in and they went in and greeted him. Al-Ma’mun spent an hour talking with and welcoming them. Then he said, “I want to take you as witnesses for me in the presence of the Blessed the Sublime God. Whoever needs to go to the toilet should do so. Then take off your shoes and coats and sit down and relax.” They did as he ordered. Then he faced the people and said, “O people! I have called you in to serve as witnesses in the presence of the Sublime God. Fear God. Look at yourselves and your leaders. My position and majesty should not prevent you from accepting what is right no matter who says it, or rejecting what is wrong no matter who says it. Be afraid of the Fire for yourselves and seek nearness to the Sublime God by pleasing and obeying Him. Know that those who get close to creatures by disobeying the Creator will be subdued to those creatures by God. Therefore, use your full power of reasoning in arguing with me. I am a man who thinks that Ali is the best man after the Prophet of God . Therefore acknowledge me, if you consider what I say to be right and if I am correct. And argue with me and reject my claim using reasoning if I am wrong. Either I will question you, or you will question me as you please.” Once Al-Ma’mun said this, the experts on traditions said, “Fine. We will ask you.” Al-Ma’mun said, “Ask, but appoint one of you tospeak. Once he speaks if others have something to add, they can do so. Or if he makes a mistake, others can correct him.” Then one of them said, “We believe that the best of the people after the Prophet of God was Abu Bakr. This is because there is a unanimously accepted tradition in which we read that God’s Prophet (S) said, ‘Follow those who will be after me - Abu Bakr and Umar.’ We know that he is the best of the people after the Prophet (S), since the Prophet of Mercy issued this decree and ordered that we follow them since we know that only the best of the people will be appointed as leader.”Then Al-Ma’mun said, “There are many traditions. Either they are all correct or all incorrect. Or some are correct and some are incorrect. If we say that they are all correct, then they are all incorrect since some of them violate others. If we say they are all wrong; then the religion is wrong and the holy jurisprudence will be invalidated. Then we must accept the third option: that is some of the traditions are correct and some are incorrect. Now it is so that we must have some reason for their being correct to believe them and reject what is opposite to them. If the reason behind the tradition is right, we must believe it, accept it and put it into action. However, the tradition which you cited includes the proof which invalidates it within itself, since the Prophet of God is the most knowledgeable and wise. He is the most honest of the people. He is the person most improbable to misguide the people towards the impossible or towards believing what is wrong. Therefore, he should not have issued a decree to have these two people become his successors and Divine Leaders. This is because either both of them follow the same manners or followed opposite manners. If they were the same in all aspects, then they must be one in number, form and body. It has not been so and will never be so that two people be one and the same. But if they were different from each other, how is it permissible to follow both of them? This is impossible to do, since as you know obeying one would imply disobeying the other one, and vice versa. The reasons supporting that they were different in manners is that Aba Bakr used to capture the Ahl ar-Riddeh and Umar set them free. Umar asked Abu Bakr to put Khalid (ibn Valid) out of office and execute him for killing Malik ibn Nowayrah. Abu Bakr did not accept this and did not execute him. Umar forbade two Mutt’as ( that of women and Hajj), but Abu Bakr did not. Umar set up the payroll for the armed forces, while Abu Bakr did not doso. Abu Bakr appointed a successor for himself but Umar did not do so. There are many other examples.”The author of the book - may God be pleased with him - said, “There exists another point here which Al-Ma’mun did not mention to the enemy. That is the tradition which has not been narrated as the Prophet (S) said, ‘Follow those who will be after me - Abi Bakr and Umar.’ It has been narrated it as ‘Follow those who will be after me - Abu Bakr and Umar.’ Also some have narrated it as ‘Follow those who will be after me - Abu Bakr and Umar.’ If so, it would have the following meaning considering what was said afterwards: ‘Follow those who will be after me - O people, and Abu Bakr and Umar - follow what (exists) after me - God’s Book and my Household.” Now let us return to the rest of what Al-Ma’mun said.Another one of the experts on traditions said, “God’s Prophet (S) said, ‘If I were to choose a friend, I would choose Aba Bakr as my friend.” Al-Ma’mun said, “This is impossible, since according to your traditions the Prophet (S) established the bonds of brotherhood between his companions, but did not do so for Ali . Ali asked the reason for that. The Prophet (S) told him, “I have kept you to be my own brother.” Whichever of these we accept, the other one is rejected.Someone else said, “Ali himself said the following on the pulpit, ‘The best of the people in this nation after the Prophet (S) are Abu Bakr and Umar.’”Al-Ma’mun said, “This is impossible too. If the Prophet (S) knew that those two were the noblest of all, he would not have appointed Amr ibn al-Aas and Osama ibn Zayd to be their governors. Also Ali’s words after the demise of the Prophet (S) also reject this. Ali said, ‘I was closer to him to be his successor than I am to my own shirt. However, I feared that there may be discord (in the nation), and the new Muslim converts might return to their state of unbelief.” Ali also asked, “How could those two (Abu Bakr and Umar) be better than I am, while I worshipped God out of my own free will before they did, and will continue to worship Him after them?”Someone else said, “Abu Bakr closed the door of his house and asked, ‘Is there anyone to cancel his pledge of allegiance to me?’ Ali said, ‘God’s Prophet (S) put you ahead. Who then can push you back?’”Al-Ma’mun said, “This is not right, since Ali himself refused to pledge allegiance to Abi Bakr. You have narrated yourselves that Ali did not pledge allegiance for as long as (the Blessed Lady) Fatima was alive. Fatima willed that they bury her at night so that those two (Abu Bakr and Umar) could not be present at her funeral. And as another reason for the Prophet (S) not having established him (Abu Bakr) as his successor is that the Prophet (S) said, “Cancel the pledge of allegiance for me.” And also the Prophet (S) told the Helpers, “Vote for either Abu Obaydah or Umar.”Someone else said, “Amr ibn al-Aas said, ‘O Prophet of God! Which of your wives do you love the most?’ The Prophet (S) said, ‘Aa’isha.’ He asked, ‘Which of the men do you like the most?’ The Prophet (S) said, ‘Her father (Abu Bakr).’”Al-Ma’mun said, “This is not right either. You yourselves have narrated that when they brought some fried chicken for the Prophet (S), he said, ‘O my God! Please make the most beloved of your creatures be present here.’ And that was Ali . Then which of the two of your traditions can we believe?’” Someone else said, “In fact, Ali himself said, ‘I will carry out the punishment for accusation upon whoever considers me to be nobler than Abi Bakr and Umar.’” Al-Ma’mun asked, “How could Ali have said that he will punish one for whom punishment is ِnot decreed? If so, he would have transgressed the limits of the Honorable the Exalted God, and have acted against His orders. Considering him (Ali ) to be nobler than those two is not an accusation, either. You yourselves have narrated that your leader (Abu Bakr) said, ‘I have become your master, but I am not any better than you are.’ Then tell me which of these two men do you consider to be more honest? Which one do you consider to be correct: what Abu Bakr said about himself or what Ali said about Abi Bakr? And yet there is a contradiction in this tradition. We have to say that either Abi Bakr is honest in what he says, or he is not. If he is honest, we must ask from where he got to know that. Was it through revelation or did he just think it up himself? If you say that it was due to revelation, we know that the revelations stopped (after the Prophet (S)). And if you say that it was what he himself thought, it cannot be so since we know that there is no way one could think of such things. If you say that he was dishonest, then it is impossible for such a dishonest person to be in charge of the affairs of the Muslims, to uphold the decrees and exercise Divinely-Ordained Punishments.”Someone else said, “It has been narrated that the Prophet (S) said, ‘Abu Bakr and Umar are the Masters of the Elders in Paradise.’”Al-Ma’mun said, “This is impossible, since once an old lady called Ashja’iyya was with the Prophet (S) and the Prophet (S) said, ‘An old lady does not enter Paradise.’ She cried. Then the Prophet (S) said, ‘In fact, the Sublime God says, ‘We have created (their Companions) of special Creation. And made them virgin - pure (and undefiled), beloved (by nature), equal in age.’’ Thus you think that Abu Bakr is the only one who will become young when he enters Paradise, while you yourselves have narrated that God’s Prophet (S) told Al-Hassan and Al-Husayn that amongst all the people they are the Masters of Youth in Paradise; and that their father is even better than they are.’”Someone else said, “It has been narrated that the Prophet (S) said, ‘If I were not appointed from amongst you, then Umar would have been appointed.’” Al-Ma’mun said, “This is impossible since the Sublime God says, ‘We have sent thee inspiration, as We sent it to Noah and the Messengers after him…’ Moreover, the Sublime God says, ‘And remember We took from the Prophets their covenant: As (We did) from thee: from Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus the son of Mary: We took from them a solemn covenant.’ How could it then be possible for someone for whom there has been (taken) a covenant (from) not to become a Prophet, and someone else without a covenant become a Prophet?’”Someone else said, “The Prophet (S) looked at Umar on the Day of Arafat, smiled and said, ‘The Blessed the Sublime God is proud of His servants in general, and is especially proud of Umar.’ Al-Ma’mun said, “This is impossible since the Blessed the Sublime God would not be especially proud of Umar and leave out His Prophet (S) as if Umar is someone especial, and the Prophet is like the rest of the people. This is not stranger than another one of your traditions in which you claim that God’s Prophet (S) said, ‘I entered Paradise and heard the sound of some sandals. When I looked around, I saw Bilal - the servant of Abi Bakr who had come to Paradise before me.’ Yes, the Shiites say that Ali is betterthan Abi Bakr, but you claim that the servant of Abi Bakr is nobler than the Prophet (S) since whoever comes first is better. You have also narrated that Satan runs away even from the shadow of Umar and also claim that Satan induced the Prophet (S) to say, ‘These idols are the Majestic Peacocks.’ You think that Satan fled even from Umar’s shadow, but induced expressions of atheism in the words of the Prophet (S).”Someone else said, “The Prophet (S) has said, ‘Should the penalty descend no one but Umar ibn al-Khattab will be saved.’”Al-Ma’mun said, “This is in complete contradiction with the text of the Book. In fact, the Sublime God told His Prophet (S), ‘But Allah was not going to send them a penalty whilst thou wast amongst them…’ You are setting up Umar to be like the Prophet (S).”Someone else said, “The Prophet (S) has testified that Umar is one of the ten companions who will be in Paradise.”Al-Ma’mun said, “Were it as you claim, Umar would have never asked Huthayfa, ‘I swear to you by God to tell me if I am one of the hypocrites?’ Had the Prophet (S) told him that he was going to Paradise, would he have denied what God’s Prophet (S) had said and ask that from Huthayfa? Then it could be seen that he acknowledged Huthayfa and not the Prophet (S) which is in opposition to being a Muslim. And if he had acknowledged the Prophet (S), why then did he ask that from Huthayfa? Thus these two traditions contradict each other.”Someone else said, “In fact, the Prophet (S) said, ‘They weighed me against my nation, and I weighed more. Then they put Abu Bakr in my place and he weighed more than me. Then they put Umar in my place and he weighed more than Abu Bakr. Then they took away the scale.’”Al-Ma’mun said, “This is also impossible. Either they measured their weight or they measured their deeds. If they measured their weights, it is not acceptable that they weighed more than the whole nation. And if they weighed their deeds, the deeds of all the nation were available to weigh at that time. Still those Muslims were not created to have done any deeds. Tell me, how did they outweigh the nation?” Some said, “According to their good deeds.” Al-Ma’mun said, “Tell me, would someone who had more noble deeds after the demise of the Prophet (S)attain the same position as those who lived at the time of the Prophet (S), but had done less noble deeds? If you answer in the affirmative, I know of some people today whose good deeds - participation in a holy war, visiting the Kaaba (i.e. House of God), fasting, praying and giving charity - are much more than those who lived at the time of the Prophet (S).” They said, “You are right. The noble ones of our times are as noble as the noble ones at the time of the Prophet (S).” Al-Ma’mun replied, “Then consider what your religious leaders from whom you have learned your religion - have told you about the nobilities of Ali ; and what they have said about the ten companions whom they have promised to be sure to go to Paradise and compare them. If you see that their deeds are slightly nobler, then what you say is right. However, if you see that what they have narrated about Ali’s nobilities is more, then accept what your religious leaders have said about Ali and do not deviate from that.”The narrator added, “All of them lowered their heads.” Then Al-Ma’mun asked, “Why have you become silent?” They said, “We are finished asking questions.” Al-Ma’mun said, “Then let me ask. What was the most rewarding deed on the day in which God appointed His Prophet (S)?” They said, “Rushing ahead of others in accepting Islam since the Sublime God says, ‘And those Foremost (in Faith) will be Foremost (in the Hereafter). These will be those Nearest to Allah.’”Al-Ma’mun asked, “Do you know of anyone who accepted Islam before Ali did?”The man said, “That is right, but he was still too young to accept Islam. Abu Bakr was older and the decree was designated for him (to be the Caliph). There is some difference between these two conditions.” Al-Ma’mun said, “Tell me whether Ali’s acceptance of Islam was due to Divine Inspirations from the Sublime God, or was it just due to the invitation of the Prophet (S)? If you say that it was due to receiving inspirations, you have placed him above the Prophet (S) since the Prophet (S) did not receive any inspirations. It was Gabriel who descended (from Heaven) and delivered the messages of the Sublime God to him . However, if you say that it was due to the Prophet’s invitation, tell me whether the Prophet (S) invited Ali out of his own will or was his invitation according to God’s order. If you say that it was due to the invitation of the Prophet (S) himself, this would contradict how theSublime God describes His Prophet (S) when He says, ‘…nor am I a pretender’ or when He says, ‘Nor does he say (aught) of (his own) Desire. It is no less than inspiration sent down to him.’ If you say that it was due to God’s order, then God has ordered him to choose Ali from amongst all the children of the people to invite (to Islam). Therefore, the Prophet (S) has invited Ali to Islam due to trusting him and his being approved of by the Sublime God.On the other hand, tell me whether the Wise God would oblige His creatures to do what would be beyond their own power to do? If you answer in the affirmative, then you are an atheist. If, however, you answer in the negative, how would God order His Prophet (S) to invite someone (to Islam) who cannot accept the decree due to his being too young and not able to accept )the invitation)? Moreover, have you ever seen the Prophet (S) invite (to Islam) any other children from his family or outside his family to be designated as a model for Ali ? If you think that the Prophet (S) has not invited any other child but Ali to Islam, then this itself would designate that Ali is nobler than all other children.” Al-Ma’mun then added, “Tell me, what would be the noblest deed after having faith.” They said, “Fighting in the way of God.” He said, “Do you know of a record of fighting in the way of God for any of those ten (companions) similar to that of Ali’s record in fighting with atheists and enemies in all the battles which the Prophet (S) conducted in history? Consider the Battle of Badr in which a total of a few more than sixty people were killed. Ali killed more than twenty of them himself, while all the other people killed nearly forty of them.” One of those present in the meeting said, “Abu Bakr was in his own tent along with the Prophet (S) and was directing the battle.” Al-Ma’mun said, “What a strange thing you are saying! Did Abu Bakr plan the battles by himself and without the Prophet (S), or did he participate in the planning along with the Prophet (S), or was it the case that the Prophet (S) needed Abu Bakr’s opinion and leadership? Which of the three cases do you prefer to choose?” The man said, “I take refuge in God from thinking that he participated along with the Prophet (S) in planning the battles, or that he himself decided what to do without the Prophet (S), or that the Prophet (S) needed his opinion.” Then Al-Ma’mun asked, “Then what is the nobility of sitting in a tent and watching the fighters? If the nobility of Abu Bakr was due to his abandoning holy war and not going to thebattlefield, then we must say that all of those who disobey (God) and do not go to the battlefield are nobler than those who fight. The Honorable the Exalted God says, ‘Not equal are those believers who sit (at home) and receive no hurt, and those who strive and fight in the cause of God with their goods and their persons. God hath granted a grade higher to those who strive and fight with their goods and persons than to those who sit (at home). Unto all (in Faith) Hath God promised good: But those who strive and fight Hath He distinguished above those who sit (at home) by a special reward.’”Ishaq ibn Hammad ibn Zayd said, “Al-Ma’mun then told me to recite the Qur’anic Chapter Insan. I recited it, ‘Has there not been over Man a long period of Time, when he was nothing…’ until I reached the following verse, ‘And they feed, for the love of Allah, the indigent, the orphan, and the captive.’ And I continued reciting the Chapter up to (a.s.aying), “Verily this is a Reward for you, and your Endeavor is accepted and recognized.” Then Al-Ma’mun asked, “About whom were these verses recited?” I said, “About Ali.” He asked, “Do you know of any traditions in which it is narrated that while Ali fed the poor and assisted the orphans and the captives, he said, ‘We feed you for the sake of Allah alone: no reward do we desire from you, nor thanks’ as it appears in the Qur’an?” I said, “No.” Al-Ma’mun said, “Then the Honorable the Exalted God was aware of what went on within Ali’s heart and expressed it in His Book to make it known to His creatures.” Al-Ma’mun asked, “Do you understand what the Sublime God describes when He describes Paradise in this verse saying, ‘Crystal-clear, made of silver: they will determine the measure thereof (according to their wishes).’” I said, “No.” He said, “This is another nobility. How could there be any crystal-clear silver?” Ishaq said, “I do not know.” Al-Ma’mun replied, “He wants us to imagine silver so clear that one can see its inside from the outside. O Ishaq! This is similar to what the Prophet of God said, ‘O slower! Be more patient with these crystal-clear ones’ referring to ladies due to their being so delicate. It is also similar to what the Prophet of God said, ‘I rode Abu Talha’s horse and found it like a sea’ implying that it galloped very fast just as the sea waves do. And as the Sublime God says, ‘…death will come to him from every quarter, yet will he not die: and in front of him will be a chastisement unrelenting’ even though he will die even if death comes to him from just one side.”Then Al-Ma’mun asked, “O Ishaq! Are you not one of those who testify that those ten (companions) are in Paradise?” I said, “yes.” He said, “If you saw that someone did not know whether this tradition was correct or not, would you consider him to be an atheist?” I said, “No.” Al-Ma’mun asked, “What if he asks whether this Chapter is from the Qur’an or not, will you then consider him to be an atheist?” I said, “Yes.” Al-Ma’mun said, “Then I consider the nobility of this man (Ali ) to be more. O Ishaq! Tell me if you consider the tradition about the fried chicken (which was brought for the Prophet (S)) to be correct or not?” I said, “Yes.” Al-Ma’mun said, “By God, your animosity can be seen from this. There are only three possibilities. It is either that he was accepted due to the supplications of the Prophet (S), or he was rejected, or that God could not recognize between the noble one and the others. Tell me, which one do you like the most?” Ishaq said, “I kept my head down for some time and then I said, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! The Sublime God said the following regarding Abi Bakr: He had no more than one companion; the two were in the cave, and he said to his companion, ‘Have no fear, for Allah is with us’: then Allah sent down His peace upon him, and strengthened him with forces which ye saw not, and humbled to the depths the word of the Unbelievers. But the word of Allah is exalted to the heights: for Allah is Exalted in Might, Wise.’”Al-Ma’mun said, “Glory be to God! How little is your knowledge of the Book? Can an atheist be a companion of a believer? What kind of nobility is this? Didn’t you hear the Words of the Sublime God, ‘His companion said to him, in the course of the argument with him: Dost thou deny Him Who created thee out of dust, then out of a sperm-drop, then fashioned thee into a man?’ Thus you see that God made an atheist a believer’s companion. Or according to the following poems from al-Hothali:The morning came and the horse which I rode was wildIt saw the East from beneath its cover.Or as Al-Azdi said,I was frightened about being alone there with my only companion,being a gentle, tall, four-legged animal with thin forelegs.Here the poet has likened his horse to his companion. And when the Sublime God says, ‘…for God is with us…’ means that the Blessed the Sublime God is with every good-doer and every evil-doer. Have you not heard the Words of the Sublime God, ‘Seest thou not that Allah doth know (all) that is in the heavens and on earth? There is not a secret consultation between three, but He makes the fourth among them, nor between five but He makes the sixth, nor between fewer nor more, but He is in their midst, wheresoever they be: In the end will He tell them the truth of their conduct, on the Day of Judgment. For Allah has full knowledge of all things.’ And regarding His words, ‘Have no fear…’ Tell me about the fears of Abi Bakr. Were they said in obedience, or disobedience? If you consider them to be said in obedience, you have said that the Prophet (S) admonished him against obedience. However, this contradicts what a wise person would do. And if you think that he has disobeyed, then what is the nobility of one who is disobedient? Tell me, upon whom did God send down peace in the following Words of the Sublime God, ‘…then Allah sent down His peace upon him…’”Ishaq replied, “To Abi Bakr since the Prophet (S) did not need any peace. The Prophet (S) was not afraid.”He said, “Let me know about the Words of the Honorable the Exalted, ‘Assuredly Allah did help you in many battlefields and on the day of Hunain: Behold! your great numbers elated you, but they availed you naught: the land, for all that it is wide, did constrain you, and ye turned back in retreat. But Allah did pour His calm on the Messenger and on the Believers…’”Al-Ma’mun asked, “Do you know who is meant by the believers to whom the Sublime God refers in this verse?” I said, “I do not know.” Al-Ma’mun said, “On the day of the Battle of Hunain the people fled from the battlefield. Only seven people from the Hashemites stayed with the Prophet of God . They consisted of Ali who fought with his sword, Abbas who held the horse-strap for the Prophet of God , and five others who surrounded the Prophet (S) fearing that the pagans might strike him with their weapons, until the Blessed the Sublime God granted victory to His Messenger . Therefore, the reference to the believers in this verse is to Ali and those of the Hashemites who stayed there. Then who is nobler? The one (Ali ) who was with theProphet (S) and peace descended upon him and the Prophet (S), or the one (Abu Bakr) who was with the Prophet (S) in the cave, but was not deserving enough for peace to be descended upon? O Ishaq! Which one is nobler? The one (Abu Bakr) who was in the cave with the Prophet (S) or the one (Ali ) who slept in the Prophet’s bed sacrificing himself to allow the Prophet (S) to complete his Emigration. In fact, the Blessed the Sublime God ordered His Prophet (S) to order Ali to sleep in the Prophet’s bed, so that the Prophet’s life would be saved. Ali asked, “O the Prophet of GOD! Will you be saved this way?” The Prophet (S) said, “Yes.” Then Ali said, “I hear and obey.” Then he slept in the Prophet’s bed and wrapped a sheet around himself. The pagans surrounded the house and went in. They had no doubt that the Prophet (S) was there. One man from each tribe had come there to each deliver a blow to the Prophet (S), so that the Hashemites could not demand retribution. Ali heard their plans and knew that his life was in danger. However, nothing could scare him as Abu Bakr was scared in the cave. Yet, Abu Bakr was with the Prophet (S) while Ali was there alone. Ali was patient and steadfast. The Sublime God sent down angels to guard him from the evils of the Quraysh (tribe) enemies. When dawn came, they saw him, looked at him and asked, “Where is Muhammad?” Ali replied, “I do not know.” They said, “You have tricked us.” Ali joined the Prophet (S) later. Thus it was Ali who was nobler and good deeds were done by him day after day, until the Sublime God took his life and he was well forgiven by Him.”Al-Ma’mun asked, “O Ishaq! Have you not been the one who narrated the tradition on Mastery?” Ishaq said, “Yes.” Al-Ma’mun said, “Please narrate it for me.” Ishaq narrated it for him. Al-Ma’mun said, “Don’t you see that this tradition established a right for Ali incumbent upon Abi Bakr and Umar, but has not established any rights for those two incumbent upon Ali ?” Ishaq said, “The people say that God’s Prophet (S) has said this the following regarding Zayd ibn Haritha.” He asked, “Where and when did the Prophet (S) say this?” I said, “In the Ghadir Khom fter returning from the Farewell Pilgrimage of the Kaaba.” Al-Ma’mun said, “Where was Zayd ibn Haritha killed?” I said, “In Mo’ta.” He said, “Was Zayd ibn Haritha not killed before the Qadir Khom instance?” I said, “Yes.” He said, “Tell me, what if your fifteen year old son says, ‘O people! Accept that my servant belongs to my cousin.’ Willyou be hurt from this?” I said, “Yes. I will not like that and tell him.” He said, “You tell your son not to say what you believe that the Prophet of God did. Woe be to you who have taken your jurisprudents as your Masters! In fact, the Sublime God says, ‘They take their priests and their anchorites to be their lords in derogation of Allah…’ Yet I swear by God that they neither fasted for them nor did they pray to them. They only obeyed whatever they said. Then Al-Ma’mun added, “Have you narrated the tradition in which God’s Prophet (S) told Ali , “Your position relative to me is as same as Aaron’s position relative to Moses.” I said, “Yes.” He said, “Don’t you know that Aaron was Moses’ brother from the side of both his father and mother?” I said, “Yes.” He said, “Was Ali the same?” I said, “No.” He said, “Aaron was a Prophet but Ali was not. Then what was the third rank which he had other than that of being the successor? This was said because the hypocrites said, ‘It was hard for the Prophet (S) to take Ali with him and left him behind while the Prophet (S) wanted him to remain there with peace of mind and that is why he said that. This is similar to what Moses told Aaron as said by the Sublime God, ‘Act for me amongst my people: Do right, and follow not the way of those who do mischief.’ I told him, “But Moses left Aaron to be his successor for all his people while Moses was alive and just went to meet his Lord - the Sublime. But the Prophet (S) left Ali as his successor only when he went to the battles.” Al-Ma’mun said, “Tell me. Were there some of his companions along with him when Moses left Aaron as his successor to go to meet his Lord - the Honorable the Exalted?” I said, “Yes.” He said, “Did he not establish him as his successor for all of them?” I said, “Yes.” He said, “The Prophet (S) also established Ali as his successor for the weak ones, the women and the children when he went to the battlefield while most of his people were along with him. However, the Prophet (S) appointed Ali to be the successor over all of them. Moreover, the proof that he appointed Ali to be his successor over them during his lifetime when he was not there, and after his demise is that the Prophet (S) said, ‘The position of Ali relative to me is like that of Aaron’s position relative to Moses with the only difference that there will be no more Prophets after me.’ Therefore, according to this expression, Ali is like the prime minister for the Prophet (S), since Moses prayed to the Sublime God and in his prayers and said, ‘And give me a Minister from my family - Aaron, my brother, add to mystrength through him.’ So Ali was to the Prophet (S) like Aaron was to Moses . Aaron was the Moses’ Minister, and Ali was the Successor of the Prophet (S) as Aaron was the Successor of Moses .” Then Al-Ma’mun looked at the theoreticians and the rhetoricians and asked, “Should I ask you questions or will you ask me?” They said, “We will ask.” He said, “Go ahead and ask.” One of them asked, “Is it not that the Divine Leadership of Ali as expressed by the Prophet of God similar to his expression of the other obligatory deeds such as ‘There are four units for the noon prayer’ or ‘The alms tax for two hundred Dirhams is five Dirhams’ or ‘Go on the pilgrimage to Mecca?’” Al-Ma’mun said, “Yes.” He asked, “Why then are there no differences of opinion about the obligatory deeds, but there are differences concerning the Successorship of Ali?” Al-Ma’mun said, “That is because the obligatory deeds are not such that the people would all compete with each other over them, but there is competition over becoming the successor.”Another one asked, “Why do you deny that the Prophet (S) ordered that the people be allowed to choose someone from amongst themselves to be his successor due to the compassion and kindness which the Prophet (S) had for his nation, and did not appoint a Successor for himself whom the people would disobey as a result of which punishment would descend upon them?” Al-Ma’mun said, “The reason I deny this is because the Sublime God is kinder to His creatures than the Prophet (S). God appointed a Prophet (S) for the people, but did not let them choose him themselves - even though He knew that there were some people among them who would disobey him and there were others who would obey him. This did not prevent the Sublime God from sending the Prophet (S). Another reason is that there would be two possibilities if God had let the people themselves choose a man (to be their Prophet). Either God orders all of them to choose someone or God orders only some of them to choose someone (to be the Prophet). If God orders all of them to choose someone, then no one could be considered to have free will and be free to choose (a.s.ince they are all ordered to vote for someone else). And if God has ordered only some of them to choose someone to be their Prophet, then the ones who are ordered to choose the Prophet must have some significant traits. If you say that they are the jurisprudents, then the significant signs of jurisprudents should be clarified.” Another one said, “It has been narrated that the Prophet (S) said, ‘In the presence of theSublime God, whatever the Muslims consider to be good is good. In the presence of the Sublime God, whatever the Muslims consider to be evil is evil.’” Al-Ma’mun said, “Here we must see whether the Prophet (S) meant all the believers or only some of them. If we say that the Prophet (S) meant all the believers, then this is an impossible thing. And if we think that the Prophet (S) meant only some of them, then as we know each group says something is good. This is like the traditions which the Shiites have narrated about Ali , and the non-Shiites have narrated about the others. Then how could that Divine Leadership which is in your mind be proven?”Another one asked, “Is it then permissible to think that the companions of Muhammad made mistakes?” Al-Ma’mun said, “How could we think that they all made a mistake and they were all at a loss, while as you think they considered Divine Leadership neither to be necessary nor a tradition. You think that Divine Leadership is not a necessity in the opinion of the Sublime God, and it is not one of the traditions of His Prophet (S). Then how could what is neither obligatory nor a tradition be a mistake?”Another one said, “Present your reasons if you claim that Ali and no one else deserves the position of Divine Leadership.” Al-Ma’mun said, “I do not claim this, but I confess to it. There are no reasons for what one confesses to. The claimant is him who thinks that he is in charge of all appointments and dismissals, and that he is in charge of everyone. As for reasons, they may be either cited by those of his (Ali’s) peers like Abu Bakr, Umar and Uthman and their followers who are all his (Ali’s) enemies, or others whose reasoning has no effect and does not exist at all. Then how could any reasons be presented in such a case?”Another one asked, “What was incumbent upon Ali to do after the demise of the Prophet of God ?” Al-Ma’mun said, “That which he did.” The man asked, “Was it not incumbent upon him to declare to the people that he (Ali) is the Divine Leader?” Al-Ma’mun said, “In fact, Divine Leadership is neither in his (Ali’s) hands, nor is it in the hands of the people so that they may choose him or prefer him over others. Rather, it is in the hands of the Sublime God as God told Abraham , ‘…I will make thee an Imam to the Nations…’ and as the Sublime God told David , ‘O David! We did indeed make thee a vicegerent onearth…’ And in the case of Adam the Honorable, the Exalted God told His angels, ‘…I will create a vicegerent on earth…’ Therefore, a Divine Leader is appointed by the Sublime God and because of His choice. A Divine Leader is perfect in Creation, from a good family, pure in nature, and innocent throughout life. If it was in one’s own hands, then anyone who was like this was a Divine Leader or deserved to be one; and once he acted against these characteristics he would be dismissed from the position of Divine Leadership automatically. In that case, the appointment and dismissal of the Divine Leader was subject to one’s deeds.”Another one asked, “Then why did you consider Divine Leadership to be a must for Ali after the demise of the Prophet (S)?” Al-Ma’mun said, “Since Ali came into existence with faith from the time of his birth, just like the Prophet (S) had faith from his childhood. Also Ali was free from the deviations of his people (of Quraysh) who had no real reasons for their idol-worshipping, just as the Prophet (S) was free from deviations and idol-worshipping. Idol-worshipping is, in fact, a form of oppression. Any oppressor cannot be a Divine Leader. One who worships idols could not become a leader by the acceptance of all the Muslims. In fact, whoever worships idols has adopted the enemy of God as a god. His decrees would be the decrees of a pagan by the unanimous consensus of all of the nation who bear witness to his atheism, unless they again bear witness that he is no longer an atheist. Whoever once professes to be an atheist should never become a ruler since in that case there would be no differences between one who has professed atheism and a ruler.”Another one asked, “Why did Ali not fight with Abu Bakr and Umar as he did with Mo’awiya?” Al-Ma’mun said, “This is impossible to ask. They should ask about positive actions, not negative ones. That is they would ask for the reasons if Ali had risen to fight them. They cannot ask the reasons for his not rising. We must see whether the issue of the Mastery of Ali was decreed by God, or by others. If it is the case that it was decreed by the Sublime God, then any doubt in His Plan constitutes atheism as the Sublime God said, ‘But no, by the Lord, they can have no (real) Faith, until they make thee judge in all disputes between them, and find in their souls no resistance against Thy decisions, but accept them with the fullest conviction.’ Therefore, one’s deeds are due to one’s origin. If the appointment of Ali wasdecreed by the Sublime God, then Ali’s deeds come from Him and the people must be content with (the appointment) and submit to Ali’s orders. Even the Messenger of God quit fighting on the day of Al-Hodaybiyeh, when the pagans prevented him from performing the ‘Umra (recommendable pilgrimage) ceremonies to the House (of God). And once the Prophet (S) brought together his troops, he fought with them as the Sublime God says, ‘…So overlook (any human faults) with gracious forgiveness.’ Then the Honorable the Exalted said, ‘…then fight and slay the Pagans wherever ye find them, an seize them, beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them in every stratagem (of war)…’”Another one asked, “If it is the case as you think that the appointment of Ali to the Divine Leadership was decreed by God and it is obligatory to obey him, why is it then not permissible for the Prophets to abandon the (God’s) invitation and the call, but it was permissible for Ali to abandon what he was ordered to do in calling the people to obey him?” Al-Ma’mun said, “We do not claim that Ali had the mission to invite the people as the Messengers did. We consider him to be a sign or link between the Sublime God and His creatures. Whoever obeys Ali is obedient to God, and whoever opposes Ali is disobeying God. Ali would have strived to call the people to obey him if he had found any helpers. Ali is not to blame for not having found any helpers. Those who did not help him are to be blamed, since they were supposed to obey him anyways. However, he was not ordered to fight without having any helpers. He is like the House of God towards which the people go to perform the Hajj pilgrimage. If they do so they have performed what is incumbent upon them to do. If, however, they do not go, it is they who are to blame, not the House of God.”Another one asked, “If it has been made incumbent upon the people that they must have a Divine Leader whom they must obey, why should it be Ali and no one else?” Al-Ma’mun replied, “That is because the Sublime God would not make some vague thing incumbent upon the people, since that is impossible to do. Thus His Messenger must introduce Ali and this obligation to the people, so that there are no more excuses left for the people in the presence of the Honorable the Exalted God. Don’t you see that if the Sublime God had made it incumbent upon the people to fast for one month, but had not specified which month to fast in and had not given any signs to identify it; and ifthe people were left free to use their own intellect to recognize the month in which the Sublime God wanted them to fast, then the people no longer needed any Prophets or Divine Leaders to inform them about what the Prophet said.”Another one asked, “How can you prove that Ali was mature when the Prophet (S) invited him (to accept Islam)? The people think that when he was invited (to accept Islam) he was a child and ordering him to do so was not permitted. The people think that Ali had not reached the age of maturity for men at that time.”Al-Ma’mun replied, “At that time, Ali was either mature enough that God sent His Prophet (S) to him and invited him (to accept Islam) in which case it would be permitted to order him to abide by Divine decrees and perform the obligatory deeds, or Ali was not mature enough for God to sent His Prophet (S) to him - which is not possible for the Prophet (S) to do as the Honorable the Exalted God says, ‘And if the apostle were to invent any sayings in Our name, We should certainly seize him by his right hand and We should certainly then cut off the artery of his heart.’ Given this, would the Prophet (S) oblige God’s servants (people) to perform what the Blessed the Sublime God has not granted them the power to carry out? This is an impossibility which cannot be. No wise person would order to do so, neither would the Prophet (S). God is so Sublime that He would not order to do what is impossible to do. His Messenger’s rank is also much higher than to order to do what is impossible to do according to the Wisdom of the Wise One (God).”At this point all the people became quiet. Then Al-Ma’mun said, “You asked me questions and argued with me. Can I ask you some questions now?” They replied, “Yes.”Al-Ma’mun said, “Is it not unanimously accepted by the nation that the Prophet (S) said, ‘Whoever purposefully ascribes lies to me has prepared his seating place in the Fire (in the Hereafter)’?” They replied, “Yes.” Al-Ma’mun said, “Have they not also narrated on the authority of the Prophet (S) that he said, ‘Whoever disobeys God - be it a minor sin or a major sin - and sets that to be his way and insists on it would reside in Fire (in the Hereafter)’?” They replied, “Yes.”Al-Ma’mun said, “Tell me if it is permissible to consider someone that the people have chosen as their leader to be called the successor of God’sProphet (S) or not. Is it permissible to consider him to be appointed by the Honorable the Exalted God even though the Prophet (S) has not established him to be his successor? If you say ‘yes it is permitted’ you are undoubtedly deceitful. If you say ‘no’ then it is a necessary conclusion that Abu Bakr be not considered to be the successor to God’s Prophet (S) nor was he appointed to the position of Caliphate by the Honorable the Exalted God. Thus you have ascribed lies to God’s Prophet (S) and are possibly of those that the Prophet (S) said would enter the Fire. Then tell me which of the following that you say is true: ‘The Prophet passed away without establishing a successor for himself’, or that you call Abu Bakr ‘O successor of God’s Prophet (S)!’ If you claim that both of these statements are true, such a claim is not possible to make since these are contradictory statements both of which cannot be true at the same time. And if you consider one to be true, then you have disproved the other one. Therefore, fear God and consider your own conditions. Do not imitate others. Avoid what is doubtful. I swear by God that the Sublime God would not accept any opinions expressed by His servants, unless they are the result of contemplation and the intellect approves of its being right. Having opposing ideas (about something) is being doubtful. It is not considered to be certitude. Having continual doubt is denying the Sublime God, and would result in dwelling in the Fire.”Al-Ma’mun added, “Tell me if it is permissible for a slave which one buys to become his master, and the buyer becomes a slave.” They said, “No.” He added, “How is it then possible for someone around whom you have gathered, supported him and put him in charge of the Caliphate be your master while you are the ones who have granted him the mastery over you? Will it not be the case that you are his masters? You have made someone to be the Caliph and have then said that he is the successor to the Prophet of God . Moreover, once you get discontented with him you would kill him, as you did with Uthman ibn Affan.”Someone said, “That is because the Imam is an agent for the Muslims as long as they are pleased with him. They can dismiss him whenever they are displeased with him.”Al-Ma’mun asked, “To whom do the Muslims, the servants (people) and the towns belong?” They replied, “To the Sublime God.” Al-Ma’munsaid, “Then God is more deserving to appoint an agent over His servants (people) and towns than anyone else, since one of the unanimously accepted principles among the nation is that whoever causes any harm to someone else’s property is held responsible for that, and no one is allowed to usurp the rights over anyone else’s property and he will be sinful and held responsible if he does so.”Then Al-Ma’mun added, “Tell me if the Prophet (S) left anyone as his successor when he died.” They answered, “No, he did not appoint any successor.” Al-Ma’mun asked, “Was not doing so guidance or deviation?” They said, “It was guidance.” Al-Ma’mun said, “Then it is incumbent upon the people to follow guidance, and not become deviated.” They said, “They did so.” Al-Ma’mun asked, “Why then did they appoint a successor after the Prophet (S), even though the Prophet (S) had not done so? Abandoning his way is in itself a form of deviation. It is impossible for what is against guidance to be guidance. If not appointing a successor is considered to be a form of guidance, then why did Abu Bakr appoint a successor for himself when the Prophet (S) had not done so? Umar also referred this issue to the council among the Muslims which was against what his friend (Abu Bakr) had done. You think that the Prophet (S) did not appoint a successor for himself, but Abu Bakr appointed a successor for himself, and Umar did not abandon appointing a successor as the Prophet (S) had done. And as you think Umar did not appoint himself a successor as Abu Bakr had done and used a third approach. Tell me, which of these do you consider to be correct. If you consider what the Prophet (S) did to be correct, then you have considered Abu Bakr to have done wrong. The same holds true for the other options. Tell me, which of these ways is correct. Is what the Prophet (S) did in not appointing a successor correct, or is what the others did who somehow appointed a successor for themselves correct? Tell me, whether not appointing a successor by the Prophet (S) is guidance, and appointing a successor by the other ones is also guidance. Thus guidance is the opposite of guidance. Then what does deviation mean? Where is it? Tell me whether there have been any successors from amongst the Prophet’s companions who have been appointed as the successor with a unanimous consensus after the Prophet’s demise.” Al-Ma’mun added, “If you say no, then you have surely decided that all the people have gone the wrong way after the demise of God’s Prophet (S).And if you say yes, then you have refuted the opinion of the whole nation and what you say will void undeniable things. Tell me whether what the Honorable the Exalted God says, ‘Say: ‘To whom belongeth all that is in the heavens and on earth?…’ is true or false?” They said, “It is true.” Al-Ma’mun said, “Is it not true that whatever is not with God belongs to God, since He is its creator and owner?” They replied, “Yes.” He said, “This disproves what you have made incumbent yourselves being to appoint a successor for God’s Prophet (S), so that the successor’s decrees are in effect regarding you and that you consider him to be a Caliph. You put him out of office whenever you get mad at him. You kill him if he refuses to give up his power. Woe be to you! Do not ascribe lies to God, since you will face its punishment when you stand in the presence of the Sublime God, and go to see God’s Prophet (S) having purposefully ascribed lies to him. The Prophet (S) has said, “Whoever purposefully ascribes lies to me will encounter his place prepared in the Fire.”Then Al-Ma’mun faced the prayer direction (the Qibla), raised his hands and said, “O God! I advised them and did not hesitate to tell them what I had to say. O God! I did not leave them in doubt. O God! In the interests of my religion I sought to get close to you by preferring Ali over others after your Prophet Muhammad (S), just as your Messenger had ordered us to do.” The narrator said, “Then we all dispersed and there was never again such a congregation for as long as Al-Ma’mun lived.”Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn Yahya ibn Imran al-Ash’ari said, “In another tradition we read that all the people became quiet. Then Al-Ma’mun asked, ‘Why have you become quiet?’ They said, ‘We do not know what to say.’ Then Al-Ma’mun said, ‘Therefore, this much debate suffices and you were convinced.’ Then he ordered that everyone be directed out. We were all directed out in a state of being confused and ashamed. Then Al-Ma’mun looked at Al-Fadhl ibn Sahl and said, ‘This is all that they had to say. No one should think that my majesty prevented them from rejecting what I said. God is the One who grants success.’”"

narrated that his father quoted on the authority of Ahmad ibn Ali Al-Ansari, on the authority of Al-Hassan ibn Al-Jahm, “One day I attended a meeting with Al-Ma’mun and Ali ibn Musa Ar-Ridha’ was also present there. The theologians and rhetoricians from various sects had gathered there. One of them asked the Imam , “O son of the Prophet of God! What is the proof of Divine Leadership which proves the validity of one who claims it?”The Imam replied, “(Divine Leadership of one who claims it is proved) by what has been written and by the proofs.”The man asked, “What is the proof of a Divine Leader?” The Imam replied, “It is knowledge and the fulfillment of our prayers.”The man asked, “How can you tell what is going to happen in the future?” The Imam replied, “It is due to the Trusted Covenant which we have inherited from God’s Prophet (S).”The man asked, “How do you become aware of the people’s secret intentions?” The Imam asked, “Have you not been told about the saying of the Messenger ?: ‘Fear the insight of the believer since he looks through a God-given light.’” The man replied, “Yes.” The Imam said, “All believers have an insight with which they look through a God-given light according to the degree of their faith, insight and knowledge. God has given us - the Divine Leaders - as much insight as He has bestowed upon all the believers. And in His Mighty Book, the Honorable the Exalted God says, ‘Behold! In this are Signs for those who by tokens do understand.’ And the first of ‘those who by tokens do understand’ was God’s Prophet (S). Then the next one after him was Ali - the Commander of the Faithful . The succeeding ones were Al-Hassan , Al-Husayn and the rest of the Divine Leaders from the progeny of Al-Husayn up until the Resurrection Day.”Al-Hassan ibn Al-Jahm added, “Then Al-Ma’mun looked at Ar-Ridha’ and said, ‘O Abal Hassan (Ar-Ridha’ )! Tell us more about what God has granted to you - the Members of the Holy Household.”Then Ar-Ridha’ said, “In fact, the Honorable the Exalted God has assisted us with a Sanctified and Purified Spirit from Himself which is not an angel and with whom He has assisted no one in the past. That Spirit is with the Divine Leaders assisting them and making them succeed. It is a Column of Light between us and the Honorable the Exalted God.”Al-Ma’mun told him , “O Abal Hassan (Ar-Ridha’ )! I have been told that there are some people who boast about you and transgress beyond bounds.” Ar-Ridha’ said, “My father Musa ibn Ja’far narrated that his father quoted on the authority of his father Muhammad ibn Ali , on the authority of his father Ali ibn Al-Husayn , on the authority of his father Al-Husayn ibn Ali , on the authority of his father Ali ibn Abi Talib that God’s Prophet (S) said, “Do not raise me up to a position higher than I deserve. In fact, firstly the Blessed the Sublime God first made me a servant (i.e. a person) before making me a Prophet. And the Blessed the Sublime God says, “It is not (possible) that a man, to whom is given the Book, and Wisdom, and the Prophetic office, should say to people: ‘Be ye my worshippers rather than Allah’s’: on the contrary (He would say) ‘Be ye worshippers of Him Who is truly the Cherisher of all: For ye have taught the Book and ye have studied it earnestly. Nor would he instruct you to take angels and Prophets for Lords and patrons. What! would he bid you to unbelief after ye have bowed your will (to Allah in Islam)?’ Ali said, “Two groups of people have ruined themselves because of me and I am not to blame for that: those who love me to the extreme, and those who hate me to the extreme. I take refuge in the Blessed the Sublime God from those who boast about us and raise us up too high above our own true rank, just as Jesus - the son of (the Blessed Lady) Mary took refuge in God from the Christians. The Sublime God says, ‘And behold! Allah will say, ‘O Jesus the son of Mary! Didst thou say unto men, worship me and my mother as gods in derogation of Allah?’ Jesus will say, ‘Glory be to Thee! Never could I say what I had no right (to say). Had I said such a thing, thou wouldst indeed have known it. Thou knowest what is in my heart, though I know not what is in Thine. For Thou knowest in full allthat is hidden. Never said I to them aught except what Thou didst command me to say, ’worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord’; and I was a witness over them whilst I dwelt amongst them; when Thou didst take me up Thou wast the Watcher over them, and Thou art a witness to all things.’ The Honorable the Exalted God also says, ‘Christ disdaineth nor to serve and worship God, nor do the angels, those nearest (to God): those who disdain His worship and are arrogant, He will gather them all together unto Himself to (answer).’ And the Honorable the Exalted God says, ‘Christ the son of Mary was no more than an apostle; many were the apostles that passed away before him. His mother was a woman of truth. They both had to eat their (daily) food…’ This means that they had to defecate.Therefore, we despise whoever considers divinity for the Prophets or the Divine Leaders, or considers that Prophethood belongs to the Divine Leaders, or considers people other than the Divine Leaders to be Divine Leaders. We despise him in this world and in the Hereafter.Then Al-Ma’mun asked, “O Abal Hassan (Ar-Ridha’ )! What do you think about the return (of Jesus).”Then Ar-Ridha’ said, “Whenever Al-Mahdi rises up from my progeny, Jesus - the son of (the Blessed Lady) Mary will descend and pray behind him.”The Imam added, “Islam started out being a stranger and it will return to that state. Blessed be the strangers.”Al-Ma’mun asked, “O son of God’s Prophet (S)! What will happen next?” The Imam said, “The right will be returned to its true possessor.” Al-Ma’mun asked, “O Abal Hassan (Ar-Ridha’ )! What is your viewpoint about those who believe in transmigration?” Ar-Ridha’ said, “Whoever believes in transmigration has indeed disbelieved in the Exalted God and denied heaven and Hell.” Al-Ma’mun questioned, “What do you say about those who were perverted?” Ar-Ridha’ said, “They were a tribe whom God became angry with and perverted. Then they lived for three more days and died. They did not have any babies during that time either. However, what you can see in the world of monkeys, pigs and similar animals are those animals who were named after the perverted ones. They are similar to those animals whom we are not allowed to eat or use otherwise.” Al-Ma’mun said, “O Abal Hassan(Ar-Ridha’ )! May God not let me outlive you! I swear by God that correct knowledge cannot be found except with you Members of the Holy Household. You have inherited all the knowledge of your forefathers. May God reward you well for Islam and its people.”Al-Hassan ibn Al-Jahm said, “When Ar-Ridha’ stood up, I followed him. He went home and I went to see him and told him, “O son of the Prophet of God! Praise be to God who directed the positive attention of the Commander of the Faithful (al-Ma’mun) towards you to the extent that he honors you.” The Imam said, “O Ibn Al-Jahm! Do not be deceived by seeing him honor me and listening to me. Soon he will kill me with poison. He will oppress me. I know this through the trusted covenant which has been passed down to me from God’s Prophet (S) by my forefathers . However, keep this a secret for as long as I am alive.”Al-Hassan ibn Al-Jahm said, “I did not tell this to anyone until Abal Hassan Ar-Ridha’ was murdered in Toos with poison. He was buried in the house of Hameed ibn Qahtaba al-Ta’ee in the same shrine in which Harun Ar-Rashid was buried, and was buried next to Harun Ar-Rashid."

There are people in the vicinity of Kufa who think that the Prophet (S) never made any mistakes when saying his prayers.” The Imam said, “May God damn them! They lie. The Only One who makes no mistakes is God - the One and Only.” Abi Salt al-Harawi added, “O son of the Prophet of God! There are people among them who think that Al-Husayn ibn Ali was not killed and God made someone else called Handhala ibn As’ad ash-Shami look like him (and be killed). And He raised Jesus - the son of (the Blessed Lady) Mary and the reason they present is by using the following verse, ‘…And never will God grant to the unbelievers a way (to triumphs)over the believers.’” The Imam replied, “They are lying. God’s Wrath and Curse be upon them! They have disbelieved in God by denying what the Prophet (S) has said about Al-Husayn ibn Ali being killed, ‘I swear by God that Al-Husayn ibn Ali will be killed.’ There is no doubt that Al-Husayn ibn Ali has been killed. Even the ones better than Al-Husayn ibn Ali - that is (Ali) the Commander of the Faithful and Al-Hassan ibn Ali were killed. There is no one of us who does not get killed. I swear by God that I will also be killed by being poisoned by a tricky unmanly person. I know this from the Trusted Covenant which we have inherited from God’s Prophet (S) that Gabriel delivered to him on behalf of the Lord of the Two Worlds. And the verse stated by the Honorable the Exalted God, ‘…And never will God grant to the unbelievers a way (to triumphs) over the believers’ provides the proof. This means that God has not granted the unbelievers any proofs superior to those of the believers. There is no doubt that the Honorable the Exalted God has informed us that the unbelievers have unrightfully killed the Divine Prophets without having any proofs or reasons. Thus God has not left any ways for them to have any proofs against His Prophets .”The author of this book (Sheikh al-Sadooq) said, “I have recorded whatever has been narrated on the subjects of exaggerators and those who believe in turning over the affairs in the book Ibtal al-Ghuluw wal Tafweedh.”"

Sugar canes cannot be found at this time.’ The Imam said, ‘Search. You will find them.’ Ishaq ibn Ibrahim said, “I swear by God that my Master will never ask for anything, unless it is available.’ They dispatched some people to all regions, and then some of the workers of Ishaq said, ‘We have some sugar canes which we have saved up in order to get some seeds.’ This is one of the signs (of his Divine Leadership).

Neither me nor others can do anything in return for Thy Kindness. I have no excuse for any bad deeds. Whatever good I receive is all from Thee. O the Gracious! Please forgive all the believing men and women in the East and the West of the Earth.’” He added, “We prayed behind Ar-Ridha’ for several months.

I saw him reach Benaj and then go to the mosque in which the Hajj pilgrims go every year. It was as if I had gone to visit God’s Prophet (S). I greeted him and stood in front of him. I found a woven tray full of dates from Medina in front of him which included some especial Sayhani dates. He picked a bunch of those dates for us and gave them to me. I counted them and there were eighteen dates. I woke up and interpreted that dream to mean that I will live one more year for each of those dates. Twenty days later I was working on the farm and the farmers were cultivating the ground. Suddenly someone came and informed us that Abil Hassan Ar-Ridha’ has come from Medina, has stopped over in that very same mosque, and the people are rushing there from everywhere. I quit work and went to see him. I saw that Ar-Ridha’ was sitting exactly in the same place that the Prophet of God sat in my dreams. There was a straw mat beneath Ar-Ridha’ just as I had seen beneath the Prophet (S). There was a woven tray full ofdates in front of him in which there were Sayhani dates. I stepped forward and greeted Ar-Ridha’ . The Imam greeted me back and said, “Come forward.” I stepped forward and Ar-Ridha’ handed me a bunch of dates. I counted the dates and they were exactly as many as his grandfather had given me. I said, “O son of the Prophet of God! Please give me some more.” Ar-Ridha’ said, “We would have given you more, if God’s Prophet (S) had given you more.”The author of the book - may God have Mercy upon him - said, “There is a similar proof in a narration for As-Sadiq which I have mentioned in Ad-Dala’el.”"

Some highway robbers attacked it along the way and captured a man who was thought to have a lot of wealth. He was in their hands for sometime. They tortured him so that he would give them something, and then they freed him. They kept him on a block of ice and filled up his mouth with ice. They tied up his hands and feet. One of the women from the same tribe felt sorry for him and freed him without anyone knowing about it. He fled, but his mouth and tongue were wounded so much that he was unable to talk. He went back to Khorasan and heard that Ali ibn Musa Ar-Ridha’ had gone to the town of Neishaboor. One night he dreamt that someone told him, ‘The son of God’s Prophet (S) has come to Khorasan. Ask him for your cure. He may suggest to you a medicine to treat you.’ The man said, ‘I dreamt that I went to Ar-Ridha’ and reported to the Imam what had happened to me. Then the Imam told me, ‘Grind some cumin seed, thyme and salt. Wash out your mouth with it two or three times. Then you will be cured.’ He woke up and did not pay any attention to his dream. He did not even think about it. He went until he reached the gates of Neishaboor. He was told that Ali ibn Musa Ar-Ridha’ had left Neishaboor and gone to ‘Ribat Sa’d. The man decided to go there to tell the Imam about his problem and get some medication for his ailment. Then he set out for ‘Ribat Sa’d. Upon seeing the Imam , the man made an effort and described his problem saying, ‘O son of the Prophet of God! This is my problem. My mouth has been injured and my tongue does not work. I can hardly talk. Please give me some medicine.’ Ar-Ridha’ asked him, ‘Did I not teach you what to doin your dream?’ Go and do what I taught you to do and you will be treated.’ The man said, ‘O son of the Prophet of God! Please tell me again if you deem it proper.’ The Imam said, ‘Grind some cumin seed, thyme and salt. Wash your mouth with it two or three times. Then you will be cured.’ The man added, “I did just as Ar-Ridha’ had said and got cured.” Abu Hamid Ahmad ibn Ali ibn Al-Husayn As-Tha’alibi said, “I heard Aba Ahmad Abdullah ibn Abdul Rahman known as As-Safwani say that he had heard that man say this himself.”"

I rode it and went to see him. I stayed there until the night arrived. When the Imam wanted to stand up, he told me, ‘I do not think that you can return to Medina now.’ I said, ‘May I be your ransom! Yes.’ The Imam said, ‘Then spend the night with us and set out in the morning with the help of the Honorable the Exalted God.’ I said, ‘May I be your ransom! Fine. I will do that.’ The Imam ordered his maid: ‘Spread my futon out for him. Put my sheet on it and place my pillow for him.’ I asked myself, ‘Who has achieved this much honor and rank that I have? God has granted me a rank near Him which He has not granted to anyone else. Ar-Ridha’ sent me his horse to ride, spread his own futon out for me to sleep on with his own sheet and pillow. None of my friends have ever been in such a position.’ I was thinking and Ar-Ridha’ was next to me. Then suddenly Ar-Ridha’ said, ‘O Ahmad! When Zayd ibn Sohan was ill, Ali - the Commander of the Faithful went to visit him. Zayd considered this to be a source of pride for him and was haughty with the people because of that. Do not do what Zayd did then, and be humble for the sake of God.’ Then the Imam put his hands on the ground and got up.”"

Ali ibn Hamza al-Bata’ini, Ibn Ishaq ibn Ammar, Al-Husayn ibn Mihran, Al-Hassan ibn Abi Sa’eed al-Mokari were amongst them. Ali ibn Hamza asked the Imam , ‘May I be your ransom! What do you know about your father? How is his health?’ The Imam said, ‘In fact, he has died.’ Ali ibn Hamza asked, ‘Who has your father introduced to succeed him?’ The Imam replied, ‘Me.’ Ali ibn Hamza said, ‘You aresaying what none of your forefathers starting with Ali ibn Abi Talib and those who came after him have said.’ The Imam said, ‘But the best and the noblest of my forefathers who is the Prophet of God has said that.’ Ali ibn Hamza said, ‘Don’t you feel threatened by this tribe (the Abbasids) and aren’t you afraid of them?’ The Imam said, ‘If I fear them, I have assisted them against me. Abu Lahab went to the Prophet of God and threatened him. God’s Prophet (S) told him, ‘If I should fear you in the least, I have lied. I have lied about my Prophethood.’ This was the first sign of the Prophet of God . This is also my first sign for you. I have lied if Harun harms me in the least.’ Al-Husayn ibn Mihran said, ‘You have done what we want when you publicly announce your Divine Leadership.’ The Imam asked that man, ‘Do you want me to go to Harun in person and tell him that I am the do this in the beginning of his call. The Prophet (S) only Divine Leader and he is nothing? The Prophet of God did not inform his near relatives, friends and trusted friends about his Prophethood, and invited them to accept Islam. The Prophet (S) did not invite all the people. You have accepted the Divine Leadership of my forefathers and think that Ali ibn Musa is denying his father being alive due to the concealment of faith. But how is it that I announce my Divine Leadership to you without any concealment of faith, and openly declare that I am the Divine Leader? If my father was alive, how could I hide it from you and tell you that he has passed away?’”The author of this book (a.s.heikh Sadooq) - may God have Mercy upon him - said, “The reason why the Imam did not fear (Harun) Ar-Rashid was due to the Covenant he had in which his murderer was declared to be Al-Ma’mun and no one else.”"

may God be pleased with him - narrated that Muhammad ibn Abi Abdillah al-Kufi quoted on the authority of Muhammad ibn Khalaf, on the authority of Harthama ibn A’yan, “I went to see my Master and Friend - that is Ar-Ridha’ - in the Al-Ma’mun’s house. It was announced in Al-Ma’mun’s house that Ar-Ridha’ has died. However, this was not right. I entered and sought permission to visit Ar-Ridha’ .” Harthama added, “There was a young man called Sabeeh od-Daylami among the trusted servants of Al-Ma’mun who really liked my Master (Ar-Ridha’ ). That man came out and saw me. He said, ‘O Harthama! Don’t you know that I am a trusted servant of Al-Ma’mun in public and in private?’ I said, ‘Yes.’ He said, ‘O Harthama! Al-Ma’mun called me and thirty other trusted servants early in the night. I went to him. There were so many lights there which made the night seem like the day. There were many poisoned swords in front of him. He called us over one by one and made us pledge. No one else was there. He said, ‘This pledge is binding upon you. You must be loyal and do whatever I order you to do without any hesitation.’ We swore to carry out his orders. Then Al-Ma’mun said, ‘Each of you should pick up one of these swords and go to Ali ibn Musa Ar-Ridha’’s room. Do not talk to him whether you find him standing up, sitting or asleep. Just strike him (referring to Ar-Ridha’ ) with these swords; and destroy his body, bones, blood, hair and brains. Then cover him up with the rugs and wipe your swords by rubbing them on the rugs. Then come to me. If you do this and keep it a secret, I have promised myself to give each one of you ten bags of Dirhams, ten select pieces of farmland, and not take these things away from you for as long as I live.’ We picked up the swords and went to Ar-Ridha’’s room. We found him sleeping on his side, moving his fingers and saying something which we could not understand. The other servants went ahead and started to strike him with their swords, but I dropped my sword and just kept looking at him. It was as if he knew that we would attack him. He had not held up anything which could block the swords. Then the servants dropped the rugs over him and returned to Al-Ma’mun. Al-Ma’mun asked us, ‘What did you do?’ They said, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! We did what we were ordered to do.’ Al-Ma’mun said, ‘Do not say anything about this anywhere.’ When dawn came, Al-Ma’mun came out. He sat in his meeting bare-headed. He unbuttoned his shirt, declared that the Imam has died and prepared to mourn for him. He then stood up and started towalk away. I was with him. He went towards the Imam’s room and opened the door. Al-Ma’mun got shocked when he heard Ar-Ridha’’s voice. Then Al-Ma’mun asked me, ‘Who is there with him (referring to Ar-Ridha’ )?’ I replied, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! I do not know.’ Al-Ma’mun said, ‘Hurry up. Look and see who is with him.’ We rushed towards Ar-Ridha’ and saw him kneeling down in his prayer niche praying and expressing God’s glorifications. I said, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! I see someone praying and expressing God’s glorifications in the prayer niche.’ He got shocked and surprised and said, ‘Then you have lied to me and fooled me. God damn you! He looked at me amongst the people and said, ‘O Sabeeh! You know Ar-Ridha’ . Look and see who is praying.’ I entered the room and Al-Ma’mun returned. When I reached the threshold of the door, the Imam raised his voice and said, ‘O Sabeeh!’ I fell down on my face and said, ‘Yes my Master!’ He said, ‘Stand up. May God have Mercy upon you. They wished to put out God’s Light, but God wanted to perfect His Light, even though some unbelievers may dislike that.’ I returned to Al-Ma’mun. His face had turned black like a dark night. Al-Ma’mun asked, ‘What did you find after I left?’ I said, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! I swear by God that the Imam was sitting in his room, called out to me and said these things.’ Al-Ma’mun buttoned up his shirt, ordered that his robes be brought, put them on and said, ‘Announce that the Imam had fainted but is fine now.’”Harthama added, “I expressed a lot of thanks and praise to the Honorable the Exalted God. Then I went in to see my Master Ar-Ridha’ . When the Imam saw me, he said, ‘O Harthama! Do not express what you heard Sabeeh tell you about me, except for those whose hearts have been tested by God for loving us and our Mastery.’ I said, ‘Yes. My Master!’ Then the Imam said, ‘O Harthama! I swear by God that their trickery will not harm me at all until the recorded time (i.e. of the murder of Ar-Ridha’ ) arrives.’"

I said, ‘May I be your ransom! There are some people in these areas who think thatyour father is alive.’ Ar-Ridha’ said, ‘They are lying. May God damn them! They would not have divided his property up and marry off his wives, if he was alive. However, I swear by God that my father tasted death as Ali ibn Abi Talib did.’ I asked Ar-Ridha’ , ‘What do you order me to do?’ Ar-Ridha’ said, ‘You must follow my son Muhammad after me. I will leave the face of the Earth and there will be no return for me. Blessed be the shrine in Toos, and the two shrines in Baghdad!’ I said, ‘May I be your ransom! I know of one of the two shrines. Where is the other one?’ Ar-Ridha’ replied, ‘You will soon get to know of it.’ Ar-Ridha’ then added, ‘My grave and that of Harun are like this.” He was sticking two of his fingers together when he said that (implying that they will be near each other)."

I had lost between ten to fifteen children. Once I went on the Hajj pilgrimage and then went to see Abil Hassan Ar-Ridha’ . He came out approaching me in some colorful clothes. I greeted him, kissed his hands and asked him a few questions. Then I expressed my grief about the death of my children. The Imam pondered over this for a while and prayed a lot. Then he told me, ‘I hope that when you return you will have a child. And then you will have another child after that. You can enjoy them during your lifetime. In fact, if the Sublime God wishes to fulfill a prayer, He does so. He has power over all things.’ When I returned home from the Hajj pilgrimage, I saw that my wife, who was also my niece, was pregnant. She delivered a boy whom we named Ibrahim. A few years later she got pregnant again, delivered a boy whom we named Muhammad and we nicknamed him Abil Hassan. Ibrahim lived for thirty and so many years. Muhammad lived for twenty-four years. Then they both fell ill. I went on the Hajj pilgrimage again. When I returned, theywere still ill. Two months after I returned from Hajj, Ibrahim passed away. Then Muhammad died at the end of the same month.” The narrator added, “Ahmad ibn Abdullah ibn Karkhi himself (the boy’s father) lived only one and a half years more. Then he died. Before these two sons were born, none of his children survived for more than a few months.”"

Will my family and your family blame me for leaving a sign for Abal Hassan Ar-Ridha’ here?’ By God, I will narrate for you a tradition on which hearing will amaze you. One day I went to see Ar-Ridha’ and said, ‘May I be your ransom! Musa ibn Ja’far (al-Kadhim) , Ja’far ibn Muhammad (as-sadiq) , Muhammad ibn Ali (al-Baqir) and Ali ibn Al-Husayn (as-Sajjad) were your ancestors. They possessed the knowledge of whatever had happened and whatever will happen up until the Resurrection Day. Now you are their Trustee and Inheritor. You possess their knowledge. I need something.’ Imam Ar-Ridha’ asked, ‘What do you need?’ I said, ‘This is my slave-wife Az-Zaherieh. She is very special in terms of beinggood-tempered. I prefer no one over her. She has become pregnant several times, but has miscarried. Now she is pregnant again. Please suggest to me what would treat her and deliver her (a healthy) child.’ The Imam said, ‘Do not be worried about her miscarriages, since she will get well and deliver a boy who looks very much like his mother, has an extra small finger on his right hand which does not have any joints, and has an extra toe without any joints on his left foot.’ It occurred to me that I should bear witness that God has power over all things. Then Az-Zaherieh delivered a boy who looked much like his mother, with an extra finger on his right hand and an extra toe on his left foot which had no joints just as Imam Ar-Ridha’ had said. Then I see no reason for anyone to blame me for having accepted Ar-Ridha’ as a Divine Sign.”The narrator said, “There was much more than this to say, but I summarized it. There is no power nor any strength save by God - the Exalted, the Magnificent.”The author of this book (a.s.heikh Sadooq) said, “The knowledge of Ar-Ridha’ about this event was derived from what he had received from his forefathers , from the Prophet of God . That is Gabriel brought the news about the Caliphs, their children from the Umayyads and the Abbasids, and what will happen in their times and what they will do for the Prophet of God . There is no power save in God.”"

Az-Zobayr swore to that and got leprosy. I saw a lot of its signs covering his legs and knees. His father also oppressed Ali ibn Musa Ar-Ridha’ on some occasion. Then the Imam cursed him. Immediately a rock fell down from some height over him and broke hisneck. And Zobayr’s father, Abdullah ibn Mos’ab, was the one who tore up the treaty of Yahya ibn Abdullah ibn Al-Hassan, insulted him in front of Al-Rashid and said, ‘O Commander of the Faithful (i.e. Al-Rashid)! Kill him. Do not spare him since this treaty is not valid.’ Yahya ibn Abdullah ibn Al-Hassan told Al-Rashid, ‘He is the one who had rebelled before along with his brother. Now he is claiming to support us.’ Then Yahya ibn Abdullah ibn Al-Hassan recited some of Abdullah ibn Mos’ab’s poems which supported Yahya’s claim. However, Abdullah ibn Mos’ab denied having authored them. Yahya challenged Abdullah ibn Mos’ab to swear to establish that he is telling the truth, and ask God for a speedy Divine chastisement in case he lied. Abdullah ibn Mos’ab did so. However, he got a fever and died after three days. His grave also collapsed several times.”The author of the book said, “This is a long tradition, but I have summarized it.”"

God would not designate a Proof for Himself to any nation who does not know their language. Have you not heard that the Commander of the Faithful said, ‘We have been granted elaborate speech.’ Is elaborate speech anything but mastery of all the languages?’”"

I wanted to hand him the book when I was alone with him and ask him what he thoughtabout it in order to find out about the degree of his scientific mastery. Therefore I sat in a corner of the house thinking about seeking permission. There were some people sitting near the door of Ar-Ridha’’s room talking with each other. Then as I was thinking about asking for permission to see him , one of the servants came out with a book in his hand and loudly announced, ‘Who is Al-Hassan ibn Ali al-Washsha’ - the son of the daughter of Elias from Baghdad?’ I stood up and said, ‘That’s me. What do you want?’ The servant said, ‘I have been told to hand you this book. Take it.’ I took the book, went out and sat in a corner to read it. I swear by God that he had posed all the questions which I had recorded in my book to ask him, and had answered all of them. Then I became certain that he was the Divine Leader and stopped being one of the Waqafites.”"

The Muslims agree with us regarding this claim. However, the Muslims claim that Muhammad is a Prophet of God, but we do not acknowledge their claim. Therefore what both groups agree upon is better than what they disagree upon.’ Then Ar-Ridha’ asked him, ‘What is your name?’ He said, ‘John.’ The Imam replied, ‘O John! We believe in Jesus - the son of (the Blessed Lady) Mary and the Spirit of God - and His Word who believed in Muhammad . Jesus gave the glad tidings of Muhammad’s coming, and Jesus himself confessed that he was a servant who has a Lord. Then if the Jesus in whom you believe is not so, and he does not believe in Muhammad and does not believe in being a servant of God and does not accept God the Honorable the Exalted to be his Lord, then we reject such a Jesus. Then how could we reject him and you claim that we agree with each other?’ Then (John) Abu Qorrah stood up and told me (i.e. Safwan ibn Yahya), ‘Stand up. This meeting was not beneficial for us.’”"

I have seen the various forms. I will include the meaning of this narration here, even though it has been narrated in different words.“Al-Ma’mun wished in his heart that Ar-Ridha’ would fail in the arguments and be overcome by the opposing sides. However, Al-Ma’mun acted differently on the surface. Then Al-Ma’mun gathered together the jurisprudents and the masters of eloquent speech, and privately told them to argue with the Imam on the subject of Divine Leadership. Then Ar-Ridha’ told them, ‘Please choose one person from among yourselves to argue with me on your behalf. Then whatever becomes imperative for him is going to be imperative for all of you.’ Then they chose a man known as Yahya ibn adh-Dhahhak al-Samarqandi for whom there was no man in Khorasan (in Persia) to challenge. Then Ar-Ridha’ told him, ‘O Yahya! Ask me about anything you wish.’ Yahya said, ‘I will ask about Divine Leadership. How do you claim one to be a Divine Leader who did not lead the people (perhaps he was referring to Imam Ali ), and abandon one who has led the people and the people are content with his Divine Leadership?’ Ar-Ridha’ told him, ‘O Yahya! Tell me, which of the following two people are right: One who acknowledges a person who denounces himself, and one who acknowledges a person who considers himself to be honest! Which of the two are right, and which one is wrong?’ Then Yahya remained silent. Al-Ma’mun told him, ‘Answer him.’ Yahya said, ‘O the Commander of the Faithful (i.e. Al-Ma’mun)! Please excuse me from answering.’ Al-Ma’mun said, ‘O Abal Hassan (Ar-Ridha’ )! We understand your intentions behind asking this question.’ Then the Imam said, ‘Now Yahya must inform us about which of his leaders have denounced themselves and which ones have acknowledged themselves. If he thinks that they have denounced themselves, then they do not deserve to be Divine Leaders. And if hethinks that they have acknowledged themselves, then the first one said, ‘I have attained mastery over you but I am not the best of you.’ And the one who comes next will say, ‘It was a mistake to pledge allegiance to the first one. Kill anyone who does this again.’ Then, by God, he was not pleased with anything but killing those who repeated that. Then when someone is not the best of the people - given that to be the best is only possible by having such characteristics as knowledge, struggling in the way of God, and possessing other nobilities - none of which he possessed; then how can the pledge of allegiance to someone be proper if the pledge of allegiance to one has made such a mistake which deserves that anyone doing such an act (pledge of allegiance) be killed. How can his leadership be acceptable for others while he is as such? Then he himself said the following on the pulpit, ‘Indeed there is a Satan within me which may overcome me. Please direct me to the straight way whenever he (the Satan within me) makes me go astray. And please advise me whenever I make a mistake.’ Therefore, they themselves declare that they are not Divine Leaders whether they are telling the truth or lying.’ Then Yahya had no answer to give. Then Al-Ma’mun got surprised about what the Imam had said and said, ‘O Abal Hassan Ar-Ridha’ ! There exists no one else but you on the Earth who can speak so eloquently.’”"

Abul Hassan Ar-Ridha’ who was talking to others heard what Zayd had said. He faced him and said, ‘O Zayd! Have the words of the narrators from Kufa made you so proud when they say, ‘(The Blessed Lady) Fatima maintained her chastity, thus God has forbidden the Fire from touching her progeny.’ By God, this holds true only for Al-Hassan , Al-Husayn and Fatima’s own especial offspring. However, if it were the case that your father Musa ibn Ja’far obeyed God, fasted in the daytime and worshipped God at night, but you disobey God and claim to be equal with him (Musa ibn Ja’far ) in the Hereafter on the Resurrection Day, this would imply that you are dearer than him (Musa ibn Ja’far ) in the sight of God. In fact, Ali ibn Al-Husayn said, ‘There are double rewards for the good-doers from amongst us, and there are double chastisements for the evil-doers from amongst us.’’”Al-Hassan al-Washsha’ added, “Then the Imam turned to us and said, ‘O Hassan! How do you recite the following verse?, ‘He said, ‘O Noah! He is not of thy family: For his conduct is unrighteous.’’ I (Al-Hassan al-Washsha’) answered, ‘Some people read it in such a way as to mean ‘his conduct is unrighteous’ while others read it in such a manner as to mean ‘he has done ill’. Indeed those who read it in the first form are implying that he is not really of the family of Noah and consider someone else to be his father.’ The Imam said, ‘No. Indeed he was truly Noah’s son. However, since he disobeyed God the Honorable the Exalted, God separated him from his father. This is exactly the same situation that holds true for us (the Members of the Holy Household of the Prophet Muhammad (S)). Whichever one of us does not obey God the Honorable the Exalted does not belong to us. O Hassan! If you obey God the Honorable the Exalted, then you are one of us - the Members of the Holy Household.’”"

You rebelled in Basra (in Iraq) and instead of starting with burning the homes of our enemies from the Tribes of the Umayyads, Thaqeef, Adiy, Bahila and the Aal Ziyad, you started with burning the homes of your cousins!’ Zayd was somewhat ofa joker and replied, ‘O the Commander of the Faithful (Al-Ma’mun)! I made a big mistake. If I return, I will attend to them (those tribes) this time.’ Al-Ma’mun started to laugh and sent him to his brother Ar-Ridha’ with a message saying, ‘I forgave his crime for your sake.” When they brought Zayd in, Imam Ar-Ridha’ blamed him and told him, ‘You are free to go anywhere you wish.’ Then the Imam never spoke to him again for as long as he lived.”"

Al-Montasir was very eloquent in speech, but was of the Zaydite sect. He lived in Baghdad next to the Karkhaya River. He was the same person who had become the head of the army during the time of Abul Saraya. When Abul Saraya was killed, the Zaydites were dispersed. Some of them fled away to Baghdad, others went to Kufa while some others fled to Medina. Zayd ibn Musa (Ar-Ridha’’s brother) was also one of those who had fled. Al-Hassan ibn Fadhl chased him, finally caught him and imprisoned him. One day he (Al-Hassan ibn Fadhl) summoned Zayd to execute him. When the executioner arrived and drew out his sword in order to chop off Zayd’s neck, Al-Hajjaj ibn Khaythama who was present there said, ‘O Commander! Do not rush. Call me forward to give you some advice.’ Then Al-Hassan ibn Fadhl ordered the executioner to withdraw the sword and called Al-Haj’jaj ibn Khaythama forward. Al-Hajjaj ibn Khaythama asked, ‘O Commander! Has the Commander of the Faithful (Harun Ar-Rashid) ordered that Zayd be executed?’ He replied, ‘No.’ Then Al-Haj’jaj ibn Khaythama said, ’Then what allows you to kill the cousin of the Commander of the Faithful (Harun Ar-Rashid), while Harun has not issued this order, and you yourself have not sought his permission either?’ Then Al-Hajjaj ibn Khaythama told Al-Hassan ibn Fadhl the story of Abdullah ibn Aftas - Harun Ar-Rashid’s cousin - who had been imprisoned by Harun by Ja’far ibn Yahya. Ja’far ibn Yahya had killed Abdullah ibn Aftas during the New Year holidays, placed his head on a tray and sent it to Harun as a gift. Later, when Harun issued the order Masrur al-Kabir to kill Ja’far ibn Yahya, he told him, ‘If Ja’far ibn Yahya asks the reason for killing him, tell him that this is the reward for you for killing my cousin Abdullah ibn al-Aftas without my order to do so.’Then al-Hajjaj ibn al-Khaythama asked Hassan ibn Sahl, ‘Are you sure that if anything happens to your relationship with the Commander of the Faithful Harun, he would not make killing his cousin an excuse to kill you just as he (Harun) did to Ja’far ibn Yahya?’ Then Al-Hassan ibn Fadhl told Al-Hassan al-Hajjaj said, ‘May God grant you a good reward!’ Then Al-Hassan ibn Fadhl ordered that Zayd be returned to jail. He stayed in jail until the reign of Ibrahim ibn Al-Mahdi when the people of Baghdad rebelled against Hassan ibn Sahl and threw him out of Baghdad. Then Al-Ma’mun’s agents released Zayd from jail, and Al-Ma’mun sent him to his brother Ar-Ridha’ . Zayd ibn Musa lived until the end of Al-Mutawakkil’s rule and then died.”"

He put houses on fire and killed some people. That is why he is called ‘Zayd al-Nar’ Then Al-Ma’mun had him arrested and brought to him. Then Al-Ma’mun orderd that Zayd be taken to (his brother) Abil Hassan (Ar-Ridha’ ).”Then Yasir (the servant of Imam Ar-Ridha’ ) added, “When Zayd was taken to the Imam , Abul Hassan Ar-Ridha’ asked him, ‘O Zayd! Have the words of the narrators from Kufa made you so proud when they say, ‘Fatima maintained her chastity, thus God has forbidden the Fire from touching her progeny.’ By God, this holds true only for Al-Hassan , Al-Husayn and Fatima’s own especial offspring. However, if it were the case that your father Musa ibn Ja’far obeyed God, fasted in the daytime and worshipped God at night, but you disobey God and claim to be equal to him (Musa ibn Ja’far ) in the Hereafter on the Resurrection Day, this would imply that you are dearer than him in the sight of God. By God, no one can attain the ranks near God the Honorable the Exalted except by obeying Him. Do you think that you can attain such ranks by committing sins? Surely you are wrong.’ Zayd said, ‘I am your brother and the son of your father.’ Then Abul Hassan Ar-Ridha’ told him, ’You are only my brother when you obey God the Honorable the Exalted. Indeed in the Holy Qur’an it says, ‘And Noah called upon his Lord, and said, ‘O my Lord! surely my son is of my family! and Thy promise is true, and Thou art the Justest of Judges!’ Then God the Honorable the Exalted said, ‘…O Noah! He is not of thy family: For his conduct is unrighteous.’ And God threw him out (of Noah’s family) since he was a sinner.’”"

God the Highest said, ‘Then when the Trumpet is blown, there will be no more relationships between them that Day, nor will one ask after another! Then those whose balance (of good deeds) is heavy, they will attain salvation: But those whose balance is light, will be those who have lost their souls, in Hell will they abide.’’”"

They are reviled on our behalf, but we are not reviled on their behalf. They are killed for our sake, but we are not killed for their sake. Whenever one of our followers commits a sin, he becomes so upset and sorry that his sins get removed from him, even if they are as many as the drops of water in a rainfall, or as many as the number of pebbles and sand in the desert, or as many as the number of thorns and trees. And if this does not happen to himself, it will happen to his family or property. Even if does not suffer in his worldly affairs, he will have a bad dream that would cause his sins to be eliminated.’”"

I did not do it willingly, since you have deprived us of our share of the booties and the one-fifth levy which we deserve to receive.’ Then Al-Ma’mun asked, ‘What rights do you have to the booties of war and the one-fifth levy?’ The man said, ‘Indeed God the Highest has divided the one-fifth levy into six parts and said, ‘And know that out of all the booty that ye may acquire (in war), a fifth share is assigned to God, and to the Apostle, and to near relatives, orphans, the needy, and the wayfarer,- if ye do believe in God and in the revelation We sent down to Our servant on the Day of Testing, the Day of the meeting of the two forces.’God has also divided the booties into six parts and said, ‘What God has bestowed on His Apostle (and taken away) from the people of the townships,- belongs to God,to His Apostle and to kindred and orphans, the needy and the wayfarer; In order that it may not (merely) make a circuit between the wealthy among you.’’ Then the Sufi continued by saying, ‘You have prevented me from getting my right. I am one of the wayfarers. I am one of the needy. Whatever I had is finished and I no longer have anything. I am one who carries the Qur’an (I am a reciter of the Qur’an who has memorized all of the Holy Qur’an).’ Then Al-Ma’mun asked the man, ‘Should I call off God’s Decrees and not execute the Divine Punishment for theft due to these tales?’ Then the Sufi man said, ‘Start by purifying yourself. Then proceed to others. First, execute God’s punishments on yourself then punish others.’ Al-Ma’mun turned towards Abil Hassan Ar-Ridha’ and asked, ‘What is he saying?’ Then Abil Hassan Ar-Ridha’ said, ‘The man says that a thief stole his property. Then he stole some of it back.’ Al-Ma’mun got really angry and told the Sufi, ‘By God, I will chop off your hand.’ Then the Sufi asked, ‘Will you chop off my hand while you are my slave?’ Then Al-Ma’mun said, “Woe be to you! How did I become your slave?’ He replied, ‘That is because your mother (who was a slave) was bought with money from the treasury of the Muslim nation. Therefore, you are the slave of all the people of the East and the West, until they set you free. I will not set you free. You then devoured the one-fifth levy. Then you did not pay the proper share to the Members of the Household of the Prophet (S). Then you did not honor me and others like me and did not pay us what is rightfully ours. Finally, a wicked man like you would not purify a wicked one like himself. Indeed a pure one will purify him. You cannot execute the Divine Punishment for me, since one who is subject to receive a Divine Punishment himself is not allowed to execute the same form of punishment on others, until he executes it on himself first. Have you not heard that God the Highest said, ‘Do ye enjoin right conduct on the people, and forget (to practice it) yourselves, and yet ye study the Scripture? Will ye not understand?’’’ Then Al-Ma’mun turned to Ar-Ridha’ and said, ‘What is your opinion on this issue?’ Then Ar-Ridha’ said, ‘God the Highest has told Muhammad , ‘Say: With God is the argument that reaches home…’’When this argument reaches the ignorant one who is not aware of it, he understands it and becomes knowledgeable of it. This is just the same way that a knowledgeable person knows it due to his knowledge. This world and the Hereafter are both sustained based upon this argument. This man presented his own argument.’ Then Al-Ma’mun ordered that the Sufi man be set free. Al-Ma’mun then went inside and plotted against Ar-Ridha’ , until he finally poisoned Ar-Ridha’ and killed him. He also killed Al-Fadhl ibn Sahl and a group of the Shiites.”The author of this book (a.s.heikh Sadooq) - may God have mercy upon him - says, “This tradition was narrated this way, but I do not hold the responsibility for its being correct.”"

(962 A.D.) that Muhammad ibn Ali al-Majilawayh quoted on the authority of Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Khalid al-Barqi, on the authority of his father, on the authority of Al-Rayyan ibn Shabib - the maternal uncle of Al-Mo’tasim and Mareda’s brother that when Al-Ma’mun wanted to have the people pledge allegiance to him to become the Commander of the Faithful and to Abil Hassan Ar-Ridha’ to become his legal successor to the throne and for Fadhl ibn Sahl to become his minister, he ordered that three chairs be prepared and each one sat on one of the chairs. Then he granted the people permission to enter to pledge allegiance. Each person entered and pledged his allegiance. Each of the three held out their hands and the people who wanted to pledge allegiance would touch their hands and move their hands all the way across them starting from the thumb all the way to the little finger. Then they would leave from another door. At the end, a young man from the Helpers (Al-Ansar) came and pledged allegiance by touching their palms and moving his hand all the way across them starting from the little finger all the way to the thumb. Then Abul Hassan Ar-Ridha’ smiled and said, ‘All the people made their pledge of allegiance in the form of breaking their pledge, while this young man made his pledge of allegiance in the form of making a pledge.’ Al-Ma’nun asked, ‘What is the difference between breaking their pledge and making it?’ Abul Hassan Ar-Ridha’ said, ‘When they want to make a pledge of allegiance, they start moving their hand from the little finger to the thumb, but breaking a pledge of allegiance is by moving on the hand from the thumb to the little finger.’Then Al-Ma’mun ordered that the people return and perform the ceremonies all over again in the way that Abul Hassan had said. The people returned and were saying, ‘How could one who does not know the proper form of making a pledge of allegiance deserve to be a leader? Indeed one who knows this is superior to one who does not know it.’ This was a reason which led to the poisoning of Ar-Ridha’ (by Al-Ma’mun)."

That is why he honored him and loved him. The reason that he set Ar-Ridha’ up as the successor to the throne after himself was that he wanted the people to think that Ar-Ridha’ is inclined to worldly affairs, and then Ar-Ridha’ would lose his place in the people’s hearts. However, when what he had plotted did not happen. And the nobility of the Imam was increased amongst the people and his position was strengthened in the hearts of the people. Then Al-Ma’mun invited speakers from the various countries eagerly hoping that they might be able to overcome Ar-Ridha’ in their debate resulting in his deficiencies becoming apparent for the people. However none of them - whether the Jews, the Christians, the Magi, the Sabians, the Brahmans, the unbelievers, the adherers to the doctrine of the eternity of the world, and the opponents from the various Muslim sects were able to defeat Ar-Ridha’’s arguments. And they were all convinced by his arguments and proofs. Then the people said, ‘By God! Ar-Ridha’ is more deserving than Al-Ma’mun to be the Caliph.’ The reporters reported this news to Al-Ma’mun. He got really angry about this and his jealousy increased. However, Ar-Ridha’ did not fear Al-Ma’mun and clearly expressed the truth. Ar-Ridha’ often replied to Al-Ma’mun in such a way that Al-Ma’mun did not like. Then Al-Ma’mun would become angry and hold a grudge against Ar-Ridha’ , but he never made it known. Once all his plots against Ar-Ridha’ failed, he killed him with poison.”"

For example, Ar-Ridha’ would say, ‘Abu Ja’far has written me a letter’ or say, ‘I wrote such and such to Abu Ja’far.’ This was so, even though his son was still a small child in Medina. However, the Imam always addressed him with respect. Abu Ja’far would also always respond in an extremely eloquent and charming manner.

Or as Ubaydillah said he put off the blood-letting and told his servant to bring him a pomegranate. There was a pomegranate tree in the garden of Ar-Ridha’’s house.The servant picked a pomegranate from the tree. Al-Ma’mun asked him to peel it, open it up and prepare it for eating. The servant peeled it and prepared it in a bowl. Then Al-Ma’mun asked the servant to wash his hands. Then the servant brought in the pomegranate. Then Al-Ma’mun told Ar-Ridha’ , ‘Have some.’ Ar-Ridha’ replied, ‘No, not until the Commander of the Faithful (Al-Ma’mun) leaves.’ Then Al-Ma’mun insisted on it by saying, ‘By God! It is not possible. You must eat some of it in my presence. I would also have some of it along with you were it not for my stomachache.’ Then Ar-Ridha’ ate a few spoonfuls of it and Al-Ma’mun left. However Ar-Ridha’ fainted and sat up again fifty times that day before saying the afternoon prayers. Al-Ma’mun sent someone to Ar-Ridha’ and said, ‘I know that this unconsciousness and feeling of apathy is due to the phlebotomy that you had done. However, Ar-Ridha’ got worse at night, and died before the morning. The following were the final words which he uttered, ‘…Say: Even if you had remained in your homes, those for whom death was decreed would certainly have gone forth to the place of their death…’ ‘And the command of God is a decree determined.’’ When the following morning came, Al-Ma’mun woke up early and ordered that Ar-Ridha’ be washed and shrouded. He himself followed the corpse with a bare head and in bare and said, ‘O brother! Indeed there is a gap in Islam due to your demise. And God’s destiny (for you) overcame my efforts on your behalf.’ Then Al-Ma’mun had the grave of Harun Ar-Rashid (al-Ma’mun’s afther) dug open and buried Ar-Ridha’ there. Then Al-Ma’mun said, ‘I hope that God the Highest would grant some benefits to my father due to being close to Ar-Ridha’ .’”"

We reached Toos and by then his illness had got worse. We stayed in Toos for several days. Al-Ma’mun went to visit him twice daily.On the last day - the day on which he died - Ar-Ridha’ had become much weaker. After saying his noon prayer, Ar-Ridha’ asked, ‘O Yasir! Do these people not eat anything?’ I asked, ’O my master! How can they eat anything seeing the way you are?’ Then Ar-Ridha’ sat up and said, ‘Spread out the tablecloth.’ Ar-Ridha’ called in all his workers and had them all sit at the tablecloth. Ar-Ridha’ asked each one of them about his health. Then after they all had eaten, Ar-Ridha’ ordered that they take food for the women, too, and feed all of them. When this was done he got really weak and became unconscious. Everyone present started to cry. All of Al-Ma’mun’s maids and wives rushed in without wearing any veils. Crying and mourning filled up all of Toos. Al-Ma’mun himself was in bare feet and head and was hitting himself on the head and trying to cover the hair of his wives with his long beard. He was expressing his sorrow by crying and tears were flowing down his face. He went and stopped at the side of Ar-Ridha’ . Then Ar-Ridha’ regained his consciousness. Al-Ma’mun said, ‘O my Master! By God! I do not know which calamity is worse for me: losing you and being away from you, or the people’s accusing me of poisoning and killing you.’”Yasir adedd, “Then the Imam opened his eyes a little, looked at Al-Ma’mun and said, “O Commander of the Faithful! Treat Abi Ja’far (Imam Ridha’’s son) with kindness since your life and his life are like this” While he brought his forefingers together.”Yasir added, “When the night came and some time had passed by, Ar-Ridha’ passed away. Then when the morning came the people gathered there and said, ‘This man (referring to Al-Ma’mun) killed him. This man martyred him.’ They meant Al-Ma’mun. They kept on saying, ‘The son of God’s Prophet (S) was killed.’ There was a lot of turmoil there. Muhammad ibn Ja’far ibn Muhammad (Imam Ridha’’s uncle) who had sought refuge from Al-Ma’mun and had come from Medina to Khorasan was there. He was Abil Hassan Ar-Ridha’’s uncle. Then Al-Ma’mun told him, ‘O Aba Ja’far (Muhammad ibn Ja’far ibn Muhammad)! Go out to the people and tell them that they will not bring out Abal Hassan Ar-Ridha’’s corpse today. Tell them to go about doing their own business.’ Al-Ma’mun did not wish the body to be taken out fearing that it might result in sedition. Then Muhammad ibn Ja’far went out and told the people, ‘O people! Disperse! Indeed today Abal Hassan Ar-Ridha’ will not be brought out.’ Then the people dispersed. Then they performed the ritual ablution for death for Abal Hassan Ar-Ridha’ at night and buried him.”Ali ibn Ibrahim ibn Hashem added, “In fact, Ali ibn Ibrahim said that Yasir has told him something which I do not like to mention here.”"

Hashem, Al-Husayn ibn Ibrahim ibn Tatana, Al-Husayn ibn Ibrahim ibn Ahmad ibn Hisham al-Mo’addib, and Ali ibn Abdullah al-Warraq - may God be pleased with them - narrated that Ali ibn Ibrahim ibn Hashem quoted on the authority of his father that Abi Salt al-Harawi said, “I was standing in front of Abil Hassan Ali ibn Musa Ar-Ridha’ when he told me, ‘O Aba Salt! Go into this mausoleum where Harun’s grave is located. Pick a handful of dirt from each corner and bring them to me.’ I went and did what Ar-Ridha’ had asked me to do. Then when I stood up in front of Ar-Ridha’ again, he was standing near the door. I handed him the dirt one handful at a time. He smelled each one and threw it away. Then he said, ‘Here they will dig up a grave for me. A rock will appear which they cannot remove, even if they bring all the mattocks in Khorasan.’Then Ar-Ridha’ said the same things about the dirt at the positions of the head and the feet of Harun. Then Ar-Ridha’ said, ‘Give me that other handful of dirt.’ I handed him the dirt from the front of Harun’s grave. Ar-Ridha’ took it and said, ‘This is the dirt that will be the dirt of my grave.’ Then Ar-Ridha’ said, ‘They will dig a grave for me in this place. You must order them to dig it seven steps deep. Then you must ask them to extend the grave in one direction and construct a grave. If they refuse to do so and insist that it must be a usual type of grave, you will tell them that the grave must be as wide as the size of two arms long plus the span of one wide open hand. Indeed God will extend it as much as He wills. Once they do so, you will notice water there. Recite what I teach you and then the grave will be filled with water. You will see many small fish in it.Then you must feed them with pieces of the bread which I’ll give you now. Once they eat it all up, a large fish will appear and eat up all the small fish until they all disappear. Then the large fish will disappear too. Then you must put your hand in the water and recite what I’ll teach you now. Then the water will drain away and nothing will be left. Do not do this except in the presence of Al-Ma’mun.’ Then Ar-Ridha’ added, ‘O Aba Salt! Tomorrow I shall go to see this adulterer (referring to Al-Ma’mun)! If I leave there with a bare head, talk to me and I will respond. However, if when I return my head is covered, then do not talk to me.’”Aba Salt continued, “When the morning came, Ar-Ridha’ put on his clothes and sat down, waiting in his prayer niche. Al-Ma’mun’s servant entered after a while and said, ‘The Commander of the Faithful (Al-Ma’mun) has called you in.’ Then Ar-Ridha’ put on his shoes and cloak. He stood up and went. I followed Ar-Ridha’ until he went to Al-Ma’mun. There was a dish of grapes in front of Al-Ma’mun and several dishes of fruit, too. There was a bunch of partially eaten grapes in his hand. There were still some grapes left on it. Once Al-Ma’mun saw Ar-Ridha’ , he leaped towards him and hugged him. He kissed his forehead and had him sit down next to himself. Then he offered Ar-Ridha’ the bunch of grapes that he was holding in his hands and said, ‘O son of God’s Prophet! Have you ever seen any better grapes?’ Then Ar-Ridha’ told him, ‘It often happens that they are good grapes as if they are from Heaven.’ Then Al-Ma’mun said, ‘Have some.’ Then Ar-Ridha’ told him, ‘Excuse me from eating them.’ Then he said, ‘You must eat. Why don’t you eat? Perhaps you are suspicious of me.’ Then Al-Ma’mun picked up the bunch of grapes, had a few grapes and then offered the bunch to Ar-Ridha’ . Ar-Ridha’ ate three grapes, put down the bunch and stood up. Al-Ma’mun asked him, ‘Where are you going?’ He said, ‘I am going to where you sent me.’ Ar-Ridha’ pulled his cloak over his head and left.”Aba Salt added, “I did not talk to Ar-Ridha’ until he entered the house and said, ‘Shut the doors.’ They shut the doors. Then Ar-Ridha’ laid in bed. I stayed in the yard for a while in a sad and depressed state. Then I saw a handsome young man, who was the closest-looking person to Ar-Ridha’ I have ever seen, enter the house. I rushed ahead and asked him, ‘Sir! The doors are closed. How did you get in?’ He answered, ‘He (God) who passed me through closed doors brought me here from Medina.’ I asked, ‘Who are you?’ He replied, ‘I am the Proof of God for you. O Aba Salt! I am Muhammad ibn Ali (Imam ar-Ridha’’s son)’ Then he went to his father . He entered the room and asked me to go in with him. When Ar-Ridha’ saw him, he leaped towards him. Ar-Ridha’ hugged him and put his hands over his shoulders. Then Ar-Ridha’ kissed him on the forehead and went back to his couch with him. Muhammad ibn Ali went over to him, kissed him and quietly told him things which I could not hear. However, I could see some foam on Ar-Ridha’’s lips that was even whiter than snow. Aba Ja’far wiped it off with his tongue.Then Ar-Ridha’ placed his hand within his attire over his heart and brought out something like a sparrow. Then Aba Ja’far swallowed it. Then Ar-Ridha’ passed away. Then Abu Ja’far said, ‘O Aba Salt! Stand up. Go and bring me water and the wash basin from the cabinet.’ I answered, ‘There is no wash basin in the cabinet and there is no water there either.” However, Aba Ja’far said, ‘Go and do what I ordered you to do.’ I went to the cabinet, and saw that both water and the wash basin were available there. I brought them out. Then I tied up my robe to my waist and took off my footwear to get ready to wash Imam Ar-Ridha’ . But Aba Ja’far told me, O Aba Salt! Move aside. There is someone else here who will assist me.’’ Then Aba Ja’far performed the ceremonial burial ablutions for Ar-Ridha’ and told me, Go to the cabinet and bring me the basket in which there is a shroud and embalmment.’ I went to the cabinet. There I saw a basket which I had never seen before. I picked it up and brought it to him. Aba Ja’far shrouded the Imam and prayed for him. Then he told me, ‘Bring me that coffin.’ Then I asked, ‘Should I go to a carpenter and have him make a coffin?’ Aba Ja’far said, ‘No. Go to the cabinet. There is a coffin there.’ I went to the cabinet and found that there was a coffin there which I had never seen before. I picked it up and brought it to him.Aba Ja’far lifted Ar-Ridha’ after praying for him and placed him in the coffin. He put Ar-Ridha’’s feet side by side and said two units of prayers. Then before finishing his prayers the ceiling of the room was rent asunder and the coffin was flown out of the room from the ceiling. Then I said, ‘O son of the Prophet of God (Aba Ja’far)! Now Al-Ma’mun will come here and demand Ar-Ridha’ from us. What should we do?’ Aba Ja’far said, ‘O Aba Salt! Be quiet! The body will return. God will unite the body and the spirit together of any Prophet who dies in the East and any of his Trustees who die in the West.’ Aba Ja’far had not finished talking when the ceiling was again rent asunder, and the coffin and the body descended. Then Aba Ja’far Muhammad ibn Ali stood up, brought the corpse out of the coffin and placed it in bed as if it had neither been washed nor shrouded.Then Aba Ja’far said to me, ‘O Aba Salt! Stand up and open the door for Al-Ma’mun.’’ Then I opened the door. Al-Ma’mun and his servants were standing at the door. He entered while he was in a sad state and crying. He tore his shirt and hit himself on the head.He said, ‘O descendant of the Prophet Muhammad (S)! O my Master! Your death is a great calamity for me.’ Then Al-Ma’mun entered and sat next to Ar-Ridha’’s head and said, ‘Start to prepare him.’ Then Al-Ma’mun ordered that a grave be dug. I (i.e. Aba Salt) dug at the location that Imam Ar-Ridha’ had ordered me before to do so. Exactly whatever Ar-Ridha’ had said would appear appeared. One of Al-Ma’mun‘s asked him, ‘Don’t you say and don’t you believe that he was a Divine Leader?’ Al-Ma’mun replied, ‘Yes. He would not be a Divine Leader unless he is superior to all the people.’ Then Al-Ma’mun ordered that a grave be dug for Ar-Ridha’ facing the direction of the Qibla.”Aba Salt added, “Then I said, ‘Ar-Ridha’ has ordered me to dig down about seven steps. Then I must extend the grave for his tomb in one direction.’ Al-Ma’mun ordered the workers, ‘Do as Aba Salt says except for the tomb. Dig a usual type of grave.’ However, once Al-Ma’mun saw that the water appeared, the fish showed up, and the other things happened, Al-Ma’mun said, ‘Ar-Ridha’ continuously showed us miracles during his lifetime. We even see miracles after his death.’ One of the ministers who was there asked, ‘Do you know what Ar-Ridha’ is informing you about?’ Al-Ma’mun replied, ‘No.’ The minister said, ‘Ar-Ridha’ is trying to make you understand that the rule of you - the Abbasids - and your population and the extent of your rule is like these fish, until your time is over and your death arrives. Then you will lose your reign. Then God the Highest will designate a man from the Members of the Holy Household of the Prophet (S) as the ruler over you who will destroy all of you - from the first to the last one of you.’ Al-Ma’mun replied, ‘You are right.’Then Al-Ma’mun turned towards Aba Salt and said, ‘O Aba Salt! Tell me the words you recited which caused the big fish to swallow the little fish. Teach them to me.’ I replied, ‘By God, I have forgotten them now.’ I had said the truth but he ordered that I be thrown into jail. They buried Ar-Ridha’ and I stayed in jail for one year. I had a very hard time in jail. One night I could not go to sleep. I stayed up and prayed to God the Blessed the Highest. I kept mentioning Muhammad and his Household . I kept asking God for a happy ending. Before finishing my prayers Abu Ja’far Muhammad ibn Ali entered and said, ‘O Aba Salt! Is your breast straitened?’ Then I said, ‘By God! Yes.’ Then Aba Ja’far said, ‘Stand up and leave here along with me.’Then Aba Ja’far placed his hands to the chains on me and they all opened up. He took my hands and brought me out of jail, while the prison guards were watching us but did not have the power to say a word. Then Aba Ja’far told me, ‘Go. I entrust you to God! Know that you will never again encounter Al-Ma’mun. Neither will Al-Ma’mun ever find you.’”Aba Salt added, “Al-Ma’mun has not found me up until now.”"

(815 A.D.). Al-Ma’mun married off his own younger daughter - Umm Habib - to Ar-Ridha’ at the beginning of the year 202 A.H. (816 A.D.). He died in Toos in the year 203 A.H. (817 A.D.), while Al-Ma’mun was going to Iraq in the (Arabic) month of Rajab.”And someone other than Al-Bayhaqi narrated that Ar-Ridha’ died when he was forty-nine and a half years old. The correct information is that he died in the year 203 A.H. (817 A.D.) on a Friday during the last ten days of the (Arabic) month of Ramadhan - nine days before the end of the month."

وَنَحْنُ بِطُوسَ فَإِذَا قَالَ ذَلِكَ فَأَجِبْهُ وَقُلْ لَهُ إِنَّا نَقُولُ إِنَّ الإِمَامَ لا يَجِبُ أَنْ يُغَسِّلَهُ إِلا إِمَامٌ.فَإِنْ تَعَدَّى مُتَعَدٍّ وَغَسَّلَ الإِمَامَ لَمْ تَبْطُلْ إِمَامَةُ الإِمَامِ لِتَعَدِّي غَاسِلِهِ وَلا بَطَلَتْ إِمَامَةُ الإِمَامِ الَّذِي بَعْدَهُ بِأَنْ غُلِبَ عَلَى غُسْلِ أَبِيهِ وَلَوْ تُرِكَ أَبُو الْحَسَنِ عَلِيُّ بْنُ مُوسَى بِالْمَدِينَةِ

نَعْشٍ وَاحْمِلْنِي فَإِذَا أَرَادَ أَنْ يَحْفِرَ قَبْرِي فَإِنَّهُ سَيَجْعَلُ قَبْرَ أَبِيهِ هَارُونَ الرَّشِيدِ قِبْلَةً لِقَبْرِي وَلا يَكُونُ ذَلِكَ أَبَداً فَإِذَا ضُرِبَتِ الْمَعَاوِلُ نَبَتَ عَنِ الأَرْضِ وَلَمْ يَنْحَفِرْ مِنْهَا شَيْءٌ وَلا مِثْلُ قُلامَةِ ظُفُرٍ فَإِذَا اجْتَهَدُوا فِي ذَلِكَ وَصَعُبَ عَلَيْهِمْ فَقُلْ لَهُ عَنِّي إِنِّي أَمَرْتُكَ أَنْ تَضْرِبَ مِعْوَلاً وَاحِداً فِي قِبْلَةِ قَبْرِ أَبِيهِ هَارُونَ الرَّشِيدِ فَإِذَا ضَرَبْتَ نَفَذَ فِي الأَرْضِ إِلَى قَبْرٍ مَحْفُورٍ وَضَرِيحٍ قَائِمٍ فَإِذَا انْفَرَجَ ذَلِكَ الْقَبْرُ فَلا تَنْزِلِي إِلَيْهِ حَتَّى يَفُورَ مِنْ

الْقَبْرِ إِلا إِذَا غَابَ الْحُوتُ وَغَارَ الْمَاءُ فَأَنْزِلْنِي فِي ذَلِكَ الْقَبْرِ وَأَلْحِدْنِي فِي ذَلِكَ الضَّرِيحِ وَلا تَتْرُكْهُمْ يَأْتُوا بِتُرَابٍ يُلْقُونَهُ عَلَيَّ فَإِنَّ الْقَبْرَ يَنْطَبِقُ بِنَفْسِهِ وَيَمْتَلِئُ قَالَ قُلْتُ نَعَمْ يَا سَيِّدِي ثُمَّ قَالَ لِيَ احْفَظْ مَا عَهِدْتُ إِلَيْكَ وَاعْمَلْ بِهِ وَلا تُخَالِفْ قُلْتُ أَعُوذُ بِاللَّهِ أَنْ أُخَالِفَكَ أَمْراً يَا

إِلَيْكَ فَإِنْ قَالَ لَكَ بَلْ نَصِيرُ إِلَيْهِ فَتَسْأَلُهُ عَنِّي أَنْ يُقَدِّمَ ذَلِكَ.قَالَ فَجِئْتُهُ فَإِذَا اطَّلَعْتُ عَلَيْهِ قَالَ لِي يَا هَرْثَمَةُ أَلَيْسَ قَدْ حَفِظْتَ مَا أَوْصَيْتُكَ بِهِ قُلْتُ بَلَى قَالَ قَدِّمُوا نَعْلِي فَقَدْ عَلِمْتُ مَا أَرْسَلَكَ بِهِ قَالَ فَقَدَّمْتُ نَعْلَهُ وَمَشَى إِلَيْهِ فَلَمَّا دَخَلَ الَْمجْلِسَ قَامَ إِلَيْهِ الْمَأْمُونُ قَائِماً فَعَانَقَهُ

الْمَأْمُونُ لِلتَّعْزِيَةِ ثُمَّ قَامَ فَمَشَى إِلَى الْمَوْضِعِ الَّذِي فِيهِ سَيِّدُنَا a.sُ فَقَالَ أَصْلِحُوا لَنَا مَوْضِعاً فَإِنِّي أُرِيدُ أَنْ أُغَسِّلَهُ فَدَنَوْتُ مِنْهُ فَقُلْتُ لَهُ مَا قَالَهُ سَيِّدِي بِسَبَبِ الْغُسْلِ وَالتَّكْفِينِ وَالدَّفْنِ فَقَالَ لِي لَسْتُ أَعْرِضُ لِذَلِكَ ثُمَّ قَالَ شَأْنَكَ يَا هَرْثَمَةُ قَالَ فَلَمْ أَزَلْ قَائِماً حَتَّى رَأَيْتُ الْفُسْطَاطَ قَدْ

يَخْفَى قَالَ فَسَكَتَ عَنِّي ثُمَّ ارْتَفَعَ الْفُسْطَاطُ فَإِذَا أَنَا بِسَيِّدِي a.sُ مُدْرَجٌ فِي أَكْفَانِهِ فَوَضَعْتُهُ عَلَى نَعْشِهِ ثُمَّ حَمَلْنَاهُ فَصَلَّى عَلَيْهِ الْمَأْمُونُ وَجَمِيعُ مَنْ حَضَرَ ثُمَّ جِئْنَا إِلَى مَوْضِعِ الْقَبْرِ فَوَجَدْتُهُمْ يَضْرِبُونَ بِالْمَعَاوِلِ دُونَ قَبْرِ هَارُونَ لِيَجْعَلُوهُ قِبْلَةً لِقَبْرِهِ وَالْمَعَاوِلُ تَنْبُو عَنْهُ لا تَحْفِرُ ذَرَّةً مِنْ تُرَابِ الأَرْضِ فَقَالَ لِي وَيْحَكَ يَا هَرْثَمَةُ أَمَا تَرَى الأَرْضَ كَيْفَ تَمْتَنِعُ مِنْ حَفْرِ قَبْرٍ لَهُ فَقُلْتُ يَا أَمِيرَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ إِنَّهُ قَدْ أَمَرَنِي أَنْ أَضْرِبَ مِعْوَلاً وَاحِداً فِي قِبْلَةِ قَبْرِ أَمِيرِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ أَبِيكَ الرَّشِيدِ لا أَضْرِبَ غَيْرَهُ قَالَ فَإِذَا ضَرَبْتَ يَا هَرْثَمَةُ يَكُونُ مَا ذَا قُلْتُ إِنَّهُ أَخْبَرَ أَنَّهُ لا يَجُوزُ أَنْ يَكُونَ قَبْرُ أَبِيكَ قِبْلَةً لِقَبْرِهِ فَإِنْ أَنَا ضَرَبْتُ هَذَا الْمِعْوَلَ الْوَاحِدَ نَفَذَ إِلَى قَبْرٍ مَحْفُورٍ مِنْ غَيْرِ يَدٍ تَحْفِرُهُ وَبَانَ ضَرِيحٌ فِي وَسَطِهِ.فَقَالَ الْمَأْمُونُ سُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ مَا أَعْجَبَ هَذَا الْكَلامَ وَلا عَجَبَ مِنْ أَمْرِ أَبِي الْحَسَنِ فَاضْرِبْ يَا هَرْثَمَةُ حَتَّى نَرَى قَالَ هَرْثَمَةُ فَأَخَذْتُ الْمِعْوَلَ بِيَدِي فَضَرَبْتُ فِي قِبْلَةِ قَبْرِ هَارُونَ الرَّشِيدِ فَنَفَذَ إِلَى قَبْرٍ مَحْفُورٍ وَبَانَ ضَرِيحٌ فِي وَسَطِهِ وَالنَّاسُ يَنْظُرُونَ إِلَيْهِ فَقَالَ أَنْزِلْهُ إِلَيْهِ يَا هَرْثَمَةُ فَقُلْتُ يَا أَمِيرَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ إِنَّ سَيِّدِي أَمَرَنِي أَنْ لا أُنْزِلَ إِلَيْهِ حَتَّى يَنْفَجِرَ مِنْ أَرْضِ هَذَا الْقَبْرِ مَاءٌ أَبْيَضُ فَيَمْتَلِئَ مِنْهُ الْقَبْرُ حَتَّى يَكُونَ الْمَاءُ مَعَ وَجْهِ الأَرْضِ ثُمَّ يَضْطَرِبَ فِيهِ حُوتٌ بِطُولِ الْقَبْرِ فَإِذَا غَابَ الْحُوتُ وَغَارَ الْمَاءُ وَضَعْتُهُ عَلَى جَانِبِ قَبْرِهِ وَخَلَّيْتُ بَيْنَهُ وَبَيْنَ مَلْحَدِهِ قَالَ فَافْعَلْ يَا هَرْثَمَةُ مَا أُمِرْتَ بِهِ قَالَ هَرْثَمَةُ فَانْتَظَرْتُ ظُهُورَ الْمَاءِ وَالْحُوتِ فَظَهَرَ ثُمَّ غَابَ وَغَارَ الْمَاءُ وَالنَّاسُ يَنْظُرُونَ إِلَيْهِ ثُمَّ جَعَلْتُ النَّعْشَ إِلَى جَانِبِ قَبْرِهِ فَغُطِّيَ قَبْرُهُ بِثَوْبٍ أَبْيَضَ لَمْ أَبْسِطْهُ ثُمَّ أُنْزِلَ بِهِ إِلَى قَبْرِهِ بِغَيْرِ يَدِي وَلا يَدِ أَحَدٍ مِمَّنْ حَضَرَ فَأَشَارَ الْمَأْمُونُ إِلَى النَّاسِ أَنْ هَالُوا التُّرَابَ بِأَيْدِيكُمْ فَاطْرَحُوهُ فِيهِ فَقُلْتُ لا تَفْعَلْ يَا أَمِيرَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ قَالَ فَقَالَ وَيْحَكَ فَمَنْ يَمْلَؤُهُ فَقُلْتُ قَدْ أَمَرَنِي أَنْ لا يُطْرَحَ عَلَيْهِ التُّرَابُ وَأَخْبَرَنِي أَنَّ الْقَبْرَ يَمْتَلِئُ مِنْ ذَاتِ نَفْسِهِ ثُمَّ يَنْطَبِقُ وَيَتَرَبَّعُ عَلَى وَجْهِ الأَرْضِ فَأَشَارَ الْمَأْمُونُ إِلَى النَّاسِ أَنْ كُفُّوا قَالَ فَرَمَوْا مَا فِي أَيْدِيهِمْ مِنَ التُّرَابِ ثُمَّ امْتَلا الْقَبْرُ وَانْطَبَقَ وَتَرَبَّعَ عَلَى وَجْهِ الأَرْضِ فَانْصَرَفَ الْمَأْمُونُ وَانْصَرَفْتُ.وَدَعَانِي الْمَأْمُونُ وَخَلا بِي ثُمَّ قَالَ: أَسْأَلُكَ بِاللَّهِ يَا هَرْثَمَةُ لَمَّا أَصْدَقْتَنِي عَنْ أَبِي الْحَسَنِ a.sُ قَدَّسَ اللَّهُ رُوحَهُ بِمَا سَمِعْتُهُ مِنْكَ. فَقُلْتُ: قَدْ أَخْبَرْتُ أَمِيرَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ بِمَا قَالَ لِي. فَقَالَ: بِاللَّهِ إِلا مَا قَدْ صَدَقْتَنِي عَمَّا أَخْبَرَكَ بِهِ غَيْرَ الَّذِي قُلْتَ لِي. قُلْتُ: يَا أَمِيرَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ فَعَمَّا تَسْأَلُنِي؟ فَقَالَ يَا هَرْثَمَةُ هَلْ أَسَرَّ إِلَيْكَ شَيْئاً غَيْرَ هَذَا قُلْتُ نَعَمْ. قَالَ: مَا هُوَ.قُلْتُ خَبَرُ الْعِنَبِ وَالرُّمَّانِ قَالَ فَأَقْبَلَ الْمَأْمُونُ يَتَلَوَّنُ أَلْوَاناً يَصْفَرُّ مَرَّةً وَيَحْمَرُّ أُخْرَى وَيَسْوَدُّ أُخْرَى ثُمَّ تَمَدَّدَ مَغْشِيّاً

الْمُلْحِدِينَ,"64-1 Tamim ibn Abdullah al-Qurashi - may God be pleased with him - narrated that his father quoted on the authority of Muhammad ibn Yahya, on the authority of Muhammad ibn Khalaf at-Tateri, on the authority of Harthama ibn A’yan, “One night I was in the presence of Al-Ma’mun. He granted me permission to leave at four hours after the beginning of the night. I went home. At midnight, I heard someone knock at the door. My servant answered the door. The man at the door told him, ‘Tell Harthama that his master has summoned him.’ Then I got up immediately, quickly put on my clothes and rushed to the house of my master Ar-Ridha’ .The servant entered first and then I entered. I saw my master sitting in the yard. When Ar-Ridha’ saw me he said, ‘O Harthama!’ I said, ‘Yes, my master!’ Ar-Ridha’ said, ‘Sit down.’ Then I sat down and Ar-Ridha’ said, ‘O Harthama! Listen carefully to what I tell you. Now it is time for me to return to God the Highest and join my grandfather and my forefathers . My life has come to an end. This rebel (al-Ma’mun) has decided to poison me with chafed grapes and pomegranates. He has poisoned a thread, and has put it through the grapes using a needle and has poisoned the pomegranates by having one of his servants rub poison on his hands, and the servant has peeled the pomegranates and pulled out all the seeds, thereby covering them with poison. Then tomorrow Al-Ma’mun will invite me (to his house), offer me these grapes and pomegranates, and he will ask me (i.e. force me) to eat them. Then I will eat them. The decree will come to happen and I will die. Once I (Ar-Ridha’ ) die, Al-Maa’mun will say, ‘I must perform the ceremonial burial ablutions of his body with my own hands.’ Once Al-Ma’mun says that, you should privately tell him that I (Ar-Ridha’ ) told you to tell him (Al-Ma’mun) not to perform the ceremonial burial ablutions for me, shroud me or bury me; else the Divine Punishment that is to brought upon him (Al-Ma’mun) later will be brought upon him sooner. And that which he is trying to avoid will rush towards him. Then Al-Ma’mun will accept this and give up.’Then Harthama added, “I said, ‘Yes my master!’ Then Ar-Ridha’ continued, ‘Then Al-Ma’mun will appoint you to perform the ceremonial burial ablutions for me. Al-Ma’mun himself will sit at a high point to watch you wash my body. O Harthama! Do not do anything related to my ceremonial burial ablutions until you see a white tent set up next to the house. Once you see it set up, take me inside wearing the clothes which I had died. Stay outside and wait along with the others. Do not raise the tent to look in, lest you will be destroyed. Then Al-Ma’mun will come to you and ask, ‘O Harthama! Don’t you say that no one but a Divine Leader can wash a Divine Leader’s body? Then who washed Abal Hassan Ali ibn Musa while his son Muhammad was in Medina that is one of the cities in Hijaz, and Ar-Ridha’ is here in Toos?’ Once Al-Ma’mun says this, you should answer him as follows, ‘No one needs to perform the ceremonial burial ablutions for a Divine Leader, except for the Divine Leader after him.However, if someone violates this principle and performs the ceremonial burial ablutions for the Imam, this act will not void the Imam’s Divine Leadership. It will neither void the Divine Leadership of the Imam succeeding him, even if someone forces him not to perform the ceremonial burial ablutions for his father’s body. If Abul Hassan Ali ibn Musa Ar-Ridha’ was in Medina when he passed away, it is apparent that his son Muhammad would have performed the ceremonial ritual ablutions for him . However, this did not happen, but Muhammad performed the ceremonial burial ablutions for his father in secret.’Once the sides of the tent are lifted up you will see me in my shroud. Then lift up my body, place it in the coffin and carry me. Once he (al-Ma’mun) decides to have my grave dug, he will try to dig it in such a position that the grave of his father Harun Al-Rashid is located in the direction of the Qibla from my grave. This, however, will never happen. No matter how hard they hit the ground with a mattock, it will not be dug up, and they will not make any headway. Once they have made enough effort and got tired, tell Al-Ma’mun that I have ordered you to use a mattock and hit the ground at the location in the direction of the Qibla from the grave of his father Harun Ar-Rashid just once. Then once you do this the ground will open up, a grave will be dug and a tomb shall be erected. Once Al-Ma’mun accepts this and you see the grave appear, do not place me in it immediately. Wait until some clear water comes up and reaches the level of the ground. Then a fish as large as the grave will appear swimming there. Do not put me in it as long as the fish is moving. Then the fish will disappear and the water will be drained. Then take me to the grave and place me in it. Do not let anyone throw any dirt over my body. The grave will get filled and covered up by itself.’”Harthama added, “I said, ‘Yes. My master!’ Then Ar-Ridha’ told me, ‘Remember what I told you and act accordingly. Do not disobey.’ Then I (Harthama) said, ‘O my master! I take refuge in God that I will not disobey your orders.’”Harthama added, “Then I left there crying and sad. Tears were falling down like drops sizzling in a frying pan. No one but God the Highest knew how I felt Then Al-Ma’mun called me in and I went to him. I stood near him until daytime. Then Al-Ma’mun said, ‘O Harthama! Go to Abil Hassan Ar-Ridha’ , express my greetings to him and tell him, ‘Come to us if it is not difficult for you. Else I will come to see you.’ If Ar-Ridha’ accepts to come, insist that he comes sooner.’”Harthama added, “Once I went to Ar-Ridha’ , he asked me, ‘O Harthama! Do you remember what I have advised you to do?’ I replied, ‘Yes.’ Then Ar-Ridha’ said, ‘Give me my shoes. I know why Al-Ma’mun has sent you here.’”Harthama added, “Then I did this. Ar-Ridha’ put them on and walked towards Al-Ma’mun. Then when he entered, Al-Ma’mun stood up for him, embraced him and kissed him on the forehead. Al-Ma’mun had Ar-Ridha’ seated on his couch next to himself. He started talking to him for hours until daybreak. Then he ordered one of his servants to bring pomegranates and grapes.”Then Harthama added, “Once I heard this I could not control myself. I started to shiver. I turned around and quietly left the meeting, since I did not want Al-Ma’mun to see me in that state. I went to a corner of the palace. When the sun was about to go down, I sensed that my master had left. He had left there and returned home. Then I saw that Al-Ma’mun ordered that doctors and nurses be called in.”Harthama added, “I asked, ‘What has happened?’ They told me, ‘Ali ibn Musa Ar-Ridha’ has become ill.’ The people were in doubt, but I was certain about what had happened since I knew.”Harthama added, “When the second one-third part of the night came, loud crying could be heard from the house. I heard the crying and rushed in there from amongst the people who were rushing in. I looked and saw Al-Ma’mun standing there on his feet with a bare head and open buttons. He was crying. Then I stood among the people and wept with deep sighs until the morning. Then Al-Ma’mun held the mourning ceremonies. Then he stood up and walked to the place where our master Ar-Ridha’ was placed and said, ‘Prepare a place for us. I want to perform his ceremonial burial ablutions in person.’ I stepped forward and told Al-Ma’mun what my master Ar-Ridha’ had told me regarding the ceremonial burial ablutions, shrouding and burying of his body. Then Al-Ma’mun told me, ‘O Harthama! I will not object to your performing the ceremonial burial ablutions for him. Do as you please.’ I was standing and saw that a tent had been set up. I and everyone in the house subject to me were standing behind the tent. We could hear the praises of God and His glorifications being recited along with the sound of water being poured and pans being moved. We could also smell such a good scent that we had never before smelt before.At once, I heard that Al-Ma’mun called me to come up to the balcony of the house and said, ‘You thought that no one would perform the ceremonial burial ablutions for a Divine Leader, except a Divine Leader like himself. Then where is his son Muhammad ibn Ali to come and perform the ceremonial burial ablutions for him? Now he is in Medina, while this one (Leader) is here in Toos.’ I (Harthama) replied, ‘O Commander of the Faithful (Al-Ma’mun)! That is what we say. It is not incumbent upon anyone to perform the ceremonial burial ablutions for a Divine Leader, but another Divine Leader - one like him. However, if someone transgresses and performs the ablutions for the Divine Leader, that will not void the Divine Leadership of the Imam. Neither will the transgression of the one who has performed the ablutions for the Divine Leader void the Divine Leadership of the Imam that is to succeed, since he has been oppressed and not allowed to perform the ceremonial burial ablutions for his father. If Abul Hassan Ali ibn Musa Ar-Ridha’ was in Medina, then it is apparent that his son Muhammad would have washed him. However, now it is apparent that even though his son did not do this in public, he performed the ceremonial burial ablutions for his father in secret.’ Then Al-Ma’mun became quiet and said nothing more. Then the sides of the tent were lifted. When I looked, I saw my master Ar-Ridha’ shrouded. His body was placed where Al-Ma’mun and the rest of the people present there prayed over it. Then Ar-Ridha’ was lifted up and taken up to the location of the grave. Then I saw a group of people who were trying to dig up the ground near Harun’s grave in such a way as to position Harun’s grave to be in the direction of the Qibla from Ar-Ridha’’s grave. However, no matter how hard they tried, not even the least bit of dirt was removed from the ground. Al-Ma’mun said, ‘O Harthama! Do you see how the dirt refuses to be dug up for his grave?’ I told Al-Ma’mun, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! Ar-Ridha’ has indeed ordered me to hit one stroke of the mattock on the ground in the direction of the Qibla from the grave of your father Harun Al-Rashid, and no more.’ Then Al-Ma’mun asked me, ‘O Harthama! What will happen if you make just one strike on the ground?’ I said, “Indeed Ar-Ridha’ has informed me that it is not allowed that the grave of for your father - Harun - be positioned in the direction of the Qibla from his (Ar-Ridha’’s) grave. And if I just strike the ground once, a prepared tomb will appear where there is no need to dig up the ground and remove any dirt. A large tomb shall appear in the middle.’Then Al-Ma’mun said, ‘Glory be to God! What does all this mean? How amazing is what Abil Hassan has said! O Harthama! Strike the ground with the mattock so that we see what happens.’ Then I picked up the mattock with my hands and hit the ground with it once in the position of the direction of the Qibla from Harun Al-Rashid’s grave. Then a dug-up and prepared grave with a tomb appeared in the middle. The people were looking at it. Al-Ma’mun said, ‘O Harthama! Place Ar-Ridha’ in it.’ Then I said, ‘O Commander of the Faithful (Al-Ma’mun)! Indeed my master has ordered me not to place him in the grave until there gushes out of the earth clear water and the grave gets filled up with it up to the level of the earth. Also a fish as large as the grave shall appear and move in the water. Then I am instructed to take Ar-Ridha’ next to the grave and just leave him there when the fish disappears and the water totally drains away.’ Then Al-Ma’mun said, ‘O Harthama! Do whatever you have been ordered to do.’ Then I waited until the water and the fish appeared. Then the fish disappeared and the water was drained away while all the people were watching. Then I took the corpse next to the grave and left it there. At once, I saw that a white tent was set up next to the grave in such a way that we could no longer see the grave. Someone other than those who were present there picked up the body, and placed it in the grave. Al-Ma’mun pointed at the people to throw dirt over the body and fill up the grave. I said, ‘O Commander of the Faithful (Al-Ma’mun)! We will not do that.’ Al-Ma’mun said, ‘Woe be to you! Then who will fill up the grave?’ I said, ‘Indeed Ar-Ridha’ has ordered me not to throw any dirt over his body. He has informed me that the grave will be filled up by itself. Then it will be raised up and a four-sided tomb will be formed.’ Then Al-Ma’mun ordered the people not to throw any dirt over him. The people dropped the dirt that they had picked up. The grave was filled up, raised and turned into a four-sided tomb. Then Al-Ma’mun returned. He called me in and asked me in private, ‘O Harthama! I ask you to swear to God and tell me the truth about whatever you heard from Abal Hassan Ar-Ridha’ - may God sanctify his spirit.’ Then I told the Commander of the Faithful (Al-Ma’mun) whatever Imam Ar-Ridha’ had told me. Then he told me, ‘I swear to you by God to tell me if he informed you of anything else.’ Then I said, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! I will answer any questions that you ask.’ Al-Ma’mun asked, ‘O Harthama! Did Ar-Ridha’ tell you anything else in private?’ I replied, ‘Yes, he did.’ Al-Ma’mun asked, ‘What was it?’I replied, ‘Ar-Ridha’ informed me about the grapes and the pomegranates.’ Then Al-Ma’mun turned colors. He turned yellow, red, and black. Finally he yawned and fainted. While Al-Ma’mun was unconscious I heard him say, ‘Woe be to Al-Ma’mun from God! Woe be to him from God’s Prophet (S)! Woe be to him from Ali ibn Abi Talib . Woe be to Al-Ma’mun from (the Blessed Lady) Fatima - az-Zahra ! Woe be to Al-Ma’mun from Al-Hassan and Al-Husayn ! Woe be to Al-Ma’mun from Ali ibn Al-Husayn ! Woe be to Al-Ma’mun from Muhammad ibn Ali ! Woe be to Al-Ma’mun from Ja’far ibn Muhammad ! Woe be to Al-Ma’mun from Musa ibn Ja’far ! Woe be to Al-Ma’mun from Ali ibn Musa Ar-Ridha’ ! By God, this is the clear loss.’ Al-Ma’mun kept repeating these same words. When I saw that this change of state lasted for a long time, I got up and left. I sat in a corner of the palace. Al-Ma’mun became conscious again and called me in. I went in and saw him sitting like a drunk person. He said, ‘By God, you are not in the least dearer to me than Ar-Ridha’ was. Not even all the residents of the heavens and the earth are dearer to me than him. I swear by God that if I hear that you have told anyone else what you have heard from him, I will kill you.’ I (Harthama) said, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! Shedding my blood will be allowed for you, if you realize that I have expressed anything about this to anyone.’ Al-Ma’mun said, ‘By God, I will not accept this unless you swear and make a covenant to keep this a secret.’ Al-Ma’mun made me make a promise and a covenant, and made me swear to them. Once I left, he hit himself on the head with both hands and recited the following verse, ‘They may hide (their crimes) from men, but they cannot hide (them) from God, seeing that He is in their midst when they plot by night, in words that He cannot approve: And God Doth encompass all that they do.’And Ar-Ridha’ had a son named Muhammad - the Imam . Ar-Ridha’ had said the following about him , ‘He is honest, patient, noble, the light of the believers’ eyes and the cause of rage for the unbelievers.’”"

De’bel al-Khoza’ee said, ""When the news of the death of Ar-Ridha’ reached me, I was in Qum and I recited one of my poems in praise of him as follows:I see the Umayyads excused if they were to kill,But I see no reason why the Abbasids should at will;Sons of Harb, Marwan and their breedBanu Ma’eet, grudge and hate is their creed.People whom you had to fight in the early daysOf Islam to bring them to His ways.When they became in charge and did rule,They reverted to Kufr (unbelief) and left the Usool.Head towards Toos, to the grave siteOf the pure one, of the faith that is right,If you ever wish to remember Islam like me,Pristine, Islam of Muhammad and Ali.Two graves in Toos: one for the best of all,And the worst man people will ever recall.No good will reach the villain (Harun ar-Rashid) who is lying nighIn grave to one whose virtues reach the sky (Imam Ridha’),Nor will the pure suffer any harmWhen near the soul that will never calm.No indeed! Every soul shall reap what it did earnSo take what you will, or leave it to burn!""Al-Sowli narrated that Oun ibn Muhammad said that Mansoor ibn Talha recited poems that he quoted on the authority of Abu Muhammad al-Yazidi who had said, “When Ar-Ridha’ passed away, I recited an elegy for him as follows:What is wrong with Toos - may God not sanctify itWhich seizes a precious one each day.It began with Rashid when it grabbed him.Then it seconded it with Ar-Ridha’ Ali ibn MusaNot a regular leader was he,Rather a noble Imam - like the other ones.And the felicity of time turned into misfortunes!”I also found the following verses in Muhammad ibn Habib Dhabbi’s book:In Toos there is a tomb in which there lies an Imam DivineWhom we are enjoined to go visit his shrine.The tomb where Paradise is set up from early in the morningAnd is constantly granted greetings and peace.A tomb whose radiating rays illuminate the blindAnd its ashes treat ailments.A tomb portraying Muhammad in the eyesAnd his Trustee for by-standing believersThe eyes are humble to this allDue to the amazement in their thoughts deep withinA tomb in which those who reach at its regionTheir sins are unloaded from them when they depart.They will take with themselves an increased security from the ChastisementAnd are secured from ever suffering from poverty.God has accepted this for them on his (ar-Ridha’) behalfAnd thus the Pen is lifted off of them.If we have become needless of rain now,it is due to the clouds watering downWere it not for him, the clouds would have not poured down rain on this townThe tomb that holds Ali ibn MusaIs prouder than the land of Mecca.It is incumbent upon us to try to go visit itAs it is incumbent to respect those who reside around it.Whoever visits it recognizing his rightfulnessBy God, it is forbidden for the Fire to touch him.Surely tomorrow he shall have a praiseworthy rankWhose position will be in Gardens as the eternal abodeGod has guaranteed this for him.He has sworn to the One to Whom all pledges shall returnMay God’s Blessings be upon the Prophet MuhammadAli’s radiance and peace raised his rankMay God’s Blessings constantly be upon Az-ZahraSince the Lord knows well that she rightfully deserves it.And blessings be upon her, and then upon Al-HassanAnd upon Al-Husayn whose face shows his nobilityAnd upon Ali the virtuous and Muhammad.Blessings be upon all these Masters who are nobleand upon Ja’far - the educator and the pure-the finest blessings even though the pygmys may dislike itAnd As-Sadiq from whom we have inherited knowledgeOn which all the nations rely.Same be upon your father Musa and the ones who follow himAnd upon you be as long as Mercy lastsAnd upon the pure Muhammad - may his purity be increasedand upon Ali for as long as there is any talkingand upon Ar-Ridha’ - the son of Ar-Ridha’ - Al-Hassan whomall the towns were filled with darkness due to his demise,And blessings be upon his successor by whomthe perfect system will be completed.He is the one hoped for with whom guidance is to returnand the decrees are to be re-established.Were it not for the leaders one after the otherguidance would be extinguished - so would Islam.Each one will lead after the previous one untilthe days end with the Riser’s turnO son of the Prophet and the Proof of GodFor whom prayer and fasting has been establishedNone of you left before another one cameTo succeed him and treat the afflictions.All the same in terms of nobility and knowledgeWhether they lead in youth or old age.You are the means towards God and the firstWho know the right guidance and are its signs yourselves.You are the Masters of religion and the worldand have sanctity and protection from God.And only those who confess to your virtues are humansand those who deny are only beasts and animals.They are even more lost due to their disbeliefand their followers are subjected to arrows without heads and feathers.They benefit from your world,but are in their denial like livestock. O blessings of God whom He bestows uponWhomever He chooses from amongst His creatures to bestow upon.If God hides your bodies from usHe left your spirit and order with us.Your souls are visibly availableEven after your bodies were led away from our eyes.The only difference between you and the Prophet being Prophethood,But your steps and deeds are the sameThe two tombs in Toos: in one is buried guidanceAnd a lost one in the other sees the Blazing Fire.Two tombs set side by sideOne is a Garden of Heaven in which a leader is visited,But the next one is a ditch out of Hell.In which constant thirst is generated for its corrupt resident.The nearness of the tomb of the corrupt to that of the pure oneIncreases his torture and not reduce it as he desires.Even though the two seem to be close, they are far apartand on him there are piles of torture.There comes no harm to you from the wicked one who builtThe tombs out of megaliths and marble so close by,but it kindles on him the greatest regrets,seeing that you are honored and he is damnedAnd the extent of the torture increases every hourAnd every day and every year.O if only I knew whether I shall live during the days of the RiserKilling your enemies with a sword in my hands.My two hands shall reach out to him with a burning thirst for youBut the thirst will not be quenched until I attain my goal.Of course, your tombs excite me whileOthers get excited with raised flags and tentsWho struggle to praise the affluent and the rich,While I am honored by and love reciting your praisesAnd I dedicate it (the poem) to Abil Hassan Ar-Ridha’.To please him and for the intellects to get pleased with.Take it from Dhabbi - your servant whoIs insulted due to his servitude to you.If I respected the right of God upon you, it was becauseSurely there is a right for a guest upon his host even if its put off.Thus please accept from me this intention as a hostthen I will be enriched should you do soIf others have realized your love due to teaching,my love for you is due to an inspiration."

Then he has greeted him (Ali ). Then he has gone to visit Aba Abdullah Al-Husayn ibn Ali , and has greeted him. Then he has gone to Baghdad and greeted Abil Hassan Musa . Then he has gone back to his hometown. If once again God the Highest has granted him the opportunity to go on pilgrimage, then a pilgrimage to whom is better under these conditions? Should he who has already performed his Hajj pilgrimage go on pilgrimage to the Kaaba, or should he journey towards Khorasan to greet and visit the shrine of your father Ali ibn Musa Ar-Ridha’ .” Aba Ja’far replied, “Yes.

When someone goes on pilgrimage to him (Imam Ridha’) or spends one night next to him, it is as if he has gone on the pilgrimage to God the Highest at His Throne.” The Imam was asked, “Is the reward similar to going on the pilgrimage to God at His Throne?” The Imam replied, “Yes. When the Resurrection Day comes, there will be four of the previous and four of the latest Divine Leaders present at the Throne of the Sublime God. Those of the previous Divine Leaders will be Noah , Abraham , Moses and Jesus . And those of the latest Divine Leaders will be Muhammad , Ali , Al-Hassan and Al-Husayn . Then a rope will be dropped from the base of the Throne, and those who have gone on pilgrimage to the shrines of the Immaculate Imams will sit there along with us. Indeed those who have gone on pilgrimage to the shrine of my son Ali (Ar-Ridha’ ) will have the highest rank there and will receive the greatest rewards.”The author of this book (a.s.heikh Sadooq) - may God have mercy upon him - said, “When It is said, ‘The reward is like going on the pilgrimage to God at His Throne?’ is does not mean that this is a physical event. Indeed the angels visit the Throne, take refuge there and circumambulate around it. Then it is said, ‘The reward is like going on the pilgrimage to God at His Throne’ similar to saying that we go on pilgrimage to the House of God (the Kaaba). We know that there is no place for God. He is High and cannot be described by ascribing a place to His Throne. He is indeed the Highest.”"

authority of Abdul Salam ibn Saleh al-Harawi, ‘De’bel ibn Ali al-Khoza’ee - may God forgive him - went to see Ali ibn Musa Ar-Ridha’ in Marv and said, ‘O son of God’s Prophet (S)! I have recited some poems for you and have promised myself not to recite them for anyone, before I recite them for you.’ The Imam said, ‘Then recite them.’ De’bel recited his poems which started with:The schools for the Qur’anic verses are void of reciting nowand the landing site of revelations is left like a barren desert!Then De’bel went on until he got to this couplet:I find others share their share,Their hands of what is theirs are bare...;Abul Hassan Ar-Ridha’ cried and said, ’O Khoza’ee! You have told the truth.’ Then De’bel continued until he got to this couplet:When they were pulled taut, they did stretchTense hands that couldn’t their muscles touch,Abul Hassan Ar-Ridha’ kept rubbing the palms of his hands against each other and said, ‘Yes. Tense, indeed; they are tense...’ Then De’bel continued reciting his poems until he got to the following:I have been frightened in the worldand the days of its effort,and I hope to be saved after I dieAr-Ridha’ said, ‘May God save you from the Day of the Great Dread!’De’bel continued on. When De’bel reached the end of his poems and he said,And the tomb in Baghdad is for a purified soulTo whom the Merciful has guaranteed one of the Chambers (in Heaven)Ar-Ridha’ told him, ’Do I have the right to add two couplets to your poem at this point?’ De’bel replied, ’O son of God’s Prophet! Of course.’ Then the Imam said,And woe be to the shrine in ToosFrom its calamities the giblets burnUntil Resurrection lest it is the Riser’s turnTo overcome all grief and pain.Then De’bel asked Ar-Ridha’ , ’O son of God’s Prophet! Whose shrine is this one in Toos?’ Then Ar-Ridha’ replied, ’It is mine. Very soon, however, Toos will become the place where my visitors and followers will travel to go on pilgrimage to my shrine. Indeed, whoever visits me in my loneliness in Toos will be with me in the same rank on the Resurrection Day. He will be forgiven.’ Then Ar-Ridha’ stood up after De’bel had finished reciting his poem, and asked him to stay in his place. He went into the house. After an hour, the servant came out with a bag having one hundred Razawi Dinars in it, and said, ‘My master has said, ’Take these for your expenses.’ De’bel said, ‘By God! I have not recited these poems being greedy for anything.’ He refused the bag and asked for one of Ar-Ridha’’s attires to be blessed and honored by him. Then Ar-Ridha’ granted him a fur cloak plus the bag, and told his servant, ’Tell De’bel to take this bag, since he will need it. Tell him not to return it.’ Then De’bel accepted the bag and the cloak and left.He left Marv along with a caravan. When they reached ‘Meyan Qawhan’, they were attacked by thieves who took all the travelers as captives and tied up their hands. De’bel was among those whose hands were tied. The thieves took all the caravan’s goods and started to divide them up amongst themselves. Then one of the thieves started striking a similitude using one of De’bel’s poems:I find others share their share,Their hands of what is theirs are bare...;De’bel heard him recite these verses and asked him who had composed it. He replied, ’It was said by a man from the Khoza’ee tribe who is called De’bel ibn Ali.’ Then De’bel said, ’Indeed, I am De’bel who said this poem. You recited only one of its couplets.’ Then the man immediately rushed to their chief - a Shiite who was praying on top of a hill. The man informed the chief of what had happened. Then the chief went to De’bel in person, stopped near De’bel and asked, ’Are you De’bel?’ He said, ’Yes.’ Then the chief said, ’Then recite the entire poem.’ Then he recited the entire poem. The chief untied his hands and ordered that all the travelers from that caravan be freed. Out of respect for De’bel, the chief also ordered that all their belongings be returned to them. Then they continued on until De’bel reached Qum. Then the people of Qum asked him to recite his poems. De’bel asked all of them to come (along with him) to the Jami’a Mosque. When they all got together in the mosque, De’bel climbed up the pulpit and recited his poems for them. The people gave him many gifts.Then they found out about the cloak. They asked him to sell it to them for one-thousand Dinars. De’bel refused to do so. They asked him to sell them just a piece of it for one-thousand Dinars, but he refused. Then he left Qum.When De’bel left the town, a group of young Arab fellows arrived from behind him and took away his cloak. De’bel had to return to Qum and beg them to return the cloak to him. But they refused and even denied their elders’ requests to return the cloak. However, they told De’bel, ’There is no way that you can take back your cloak. Then just take one-thousand Dinars for it.’ De’bel did not accept, and they kept on insisting, but it was no use. So finally he lost hopes of getting it back. He asked them to give him just a piece of it. The young fellows accepted this. They gave him a piece of it plus one-thousand Dinars.De’bel set out towards his hometown. When he arrived home, he realized that the thieves had stolen everything he had there. Thus he exchanged the one-hundred Razavi Dinars that Ar-Ridha’ had given to him. He exchanged each Dinar for one hundred Dirhams and obtained ten-thousand Dirhams. Then De’bel remembered that Ar-Ridha’ had said, ‘You will need these Dinars.’ De’bel had a maid whom he dearly loved. She got bad pains in her eyes.Then the doctors came, examined her and said, ’Her right eye cannot be treated. It has become blind. However, her left eye can be treated and there is hope that it may be saved.’ Then De’bel got really sorry and upset. He remembered that he had a piece of the cloak. He tied it around her eyes one night. When the morning came, her eyes were treated and were even better than before due to the blessing of Abil Hassan Ar-Ridha’.”The author of this book (a.s.heikh Sadooq) - may God have mercy upon him - said, “I included this tradition in this chapter of the book since it is related to the rewards for going on pilgrimage to Ar-Ridha’ . There is also another tradition from De’bel ibn Ali related to Ar-Ridha’ that is related to the coming of the Riser that I would like to narrate after this tradition.”"

He raised up his head towards me and said, ‘O De’bel Khoza’ee! It was the Holy Spirit who made these verses flow out from your tongue. Do you know who that Divine Leader is? When will he rise?’Then De’bel said, ‘No my Master! I have only heard that a Divine Leader from your progeny shall rise and cleanse the earth of corruption. He shall fill it with justice.’Then the Imam said, ‘O De’bel! The Divine Leader coming after me is my son Muhammad; then after Muhammad his son Ali; then his son Hassan; and then his son al-Hujjat the Riser the Awaited one (Imam al-Mahdi) who will come during his absence (Ghayba). He will be obeyed when he appears. God shall prolong time even if there is only one day left for him to rise and fill the earth with justice, since it has been filled with oppression and injustice. But when will it be? This is like informing the people about the time of the arrival of the Resurrection Day. My father quoted on the authority of his father, on the authority of his forefathers, on the authority of Ali who narrated that God’s Prophet (S) was asked, ’O Prophet of God! When shall the Riser who is from your progeny rise?’ The Prophet (S) replied, ‘The similitude of that is like the similitude of the Hour (of Resurrection), ‘None but He can reveal as to when it will occur. Heavy were its burden through the heavens and the earth. Only, all of a sudden will it come to you.’”"

What has God done to you?’ He replied, ‘O son! When you saw my face turn dark and my tongue stopped from talking, it was because I used to drink wine in this world. I was that way until once I met God’s Prophet (S) (here in the Hereafter) wearing a white robe with a white cap on his head. Then he asked me, ‘Are you De’bel?’ I said, ‘Yes, O Prophet of God!’ Then the Prophet (S) said, ‘Recite to me the poem that you recited for my son Ar-Ridha’ .’ Then I recited it:God will not let time laugh, if it were to laughWhile Ahmad’s Household are victims of injustice.Indeed were they subjected to oppressionAnd were ruthlessly thrown out of their homes;As if they had committed what cannot be forgiven.Then God’s Prophet (S) told me, ‘Excellent!’ Then the Prophet (S) interceded on my behalf and gave me some of his clothes which you can see.’ He pointed to the clothes he was wearing.”"

to visit (Imam) Ar-Ridha’ in Toos, then perform the ritual bath (Ghusl) before you leave your house (hometown) and say the following while you are performing the ritual bath:“O God! Please cleanse me, and cleanse my heart! (Please) ‘expand my breast’, and let Thy praise and eulogy flow out from my tongue, since indeed there is no power but in Thee. O God! Please establish it as a means of cleansing and treatment for me.”Say the following as you leave your house:“In the Name of God the Beneficent, the Merciful. In the name of God, and by God, I turn to God and towards the son of God’s Prophet (Ar-Ridha’ ): God suffices me, and I rely on God. O God! I have set out to Thee. And I have decided (to get) what is near Thee.”When you go out, stop at the door of your house and say:“O God! I have turned my face towards Thee. And I have left behind my family, wealth and whatever Thee have granted me. I have trusted Thee. Then (please) do not turn me into a loser, O the One who would not make a loser anyone whom Thee wish, and will not ruin whatever he possesses. Blessings be upon Muhammad and Muhammad’s Household . And (please) guard me under Thy Custody, since nothing that Thee guard gets ruined.”Then whenever you want to go to visit, perform the ritual bathing and while you are bathing say:“O God! Please cleanse me, and cleanse my heart! (Please) ‘expand my breast’, and let Thy praise, love and eulogy flow out of my tongue since indeed there is no power but in Thee. I have indeed realized that the strength of my religion depends upon my submission to Thy Decrees, and the obeying of Thy Prophet’s traditions, and bearing witness (to this) for all Thy creatures. O God! Please establish it as a means of healing for me, and as a light, since Thee are capable of all things.”Then put on your cleanest clothes.Walk in bare feet, with calmness, dignity, exaltation, acclamation and glorification (of God). Take short steps and while you are entering (the Holy shrine) say:“In the Name of God the Beneficent, the Merciful. In the name of God (I begin), in God (I trust), and the religion of God’s Prophet (I follow). God’s Blessings be upon him and his Household. I bear witness that there is no god but God. He is One and He has no partners. And I bear witness that Muhammad is His Servant and His Messenger. And I bear witness that (Imam) Ali is God’s friend.”Then walk until you stop at his tomb. Then face him by turning your back to the Qibla and say:“I bear witness that there is no god but God, the One; and there are no partners for Him. I bear witness that Muhammad is His Servant and His Messenger. Verily, he is the Master of all those of old and those of later times. Verily, he is the Master of the Prophets and the Messengers. O God! God’s Blessings be upon Muhammad - Thy Servant, Thy Messenger, Thy Prophet and the Master of all Thy creatures - blessings that no one but Thee can measure. O God! God’s Blessings be upon the Commander of the Faithful - (Imam) Ali ibn Abi Talib - Thy servant, the brother of Thy Messenger, whom Thou chose by Thy Knowledge, whom Thou established as a guide (to show the Right Path) to those of Thy creatures, and as evidence for those whom Thou appointed to (deliver) Thy Message. And he (Imam Ali) managed the affairs of the religion according to Thy (a.s.ystem of) justice, and applied Thy judgements (to settle the issues which cropped up) among the people - whom Thee predominated thereon. And also God’s Mercy and Blessings be upon him. O God! (Please) send blessings upon (the Blessed Lady) Fatima , the daughter of Thy Prophet, the wife of Thy friend (Imam Ali ), the mother of the (prophet’s) two grandsons, (Imam) Al-Hassan and (Imam) Al-Husayn , the Masters of Youth in Heaven. She is innocent, immaculate, purified, pious, pure, content, sinless - the Master of all the Women of Heaven - blessings which no one but Thee can measure. O God! (Please) send blessings be upon (Imam) Al-Hassan and (Imam) Al-Husayn ; the two grandsons of Thy Prophet, the Masters of Youth in Heaven; Thy two established authorities among Thy creatures: And they are established as two Proofs for those whom Thou appointed to (deliver) Thy Message. And they are the two who managed the affairs of the religion according to Thy (a.s.ystem of) justice, and applied Thy judgements (to settle the issues which cropped up) among Thy creatures. O God! (Please) send blessings upon (Imam As-Sajjad) Ali ibn Al-Husayn , Thy servant, Thy established authority among Thy creatures and as evidence for those whom Thee appointed to (deliver) Thy Message.

O Abal Hassan! Peace be upon you! And may God’s Grace and His Blessings be upon you.For He is indeed worthy of all praise, full of all glory! May God’s Curse be upon the people who murdered you! May God’s Curse be upon the people who oppressed you! May God’s Curse be upon the people who established the foundations of oppression, tyranny and innovation against you the Members of the Holy Household (of the Prophet (S))!”Then you should touch the tomb and say:“O God! I set out towards Thee from my homeland, and have passed through many towns with the hope of receiving Thy Mercy. Please do not disappoint me, and do not send me back without having my needs fulfilled. Have mercy upon my turning towards the tomb of the son of Thy Messenger’s brother (Imam Ali ). May Thy Blessings be upon him and his Household. O my Master! May my parents be your ransom! I have come to visit you and I have arrived. I seek refuge in you from whatever crimes I have committed against myself: the burden of which I carry on my back.Then (please) intercede with God on my behalf on the Day of my poverty and destitution, as you enjoy an especial praiseworthy position in the Presence of God. He considers you to be an eminent man.”Then you should raise your right hand up, extend your left hand towards the tomb and say:“O God! I seek Thy Nearness through my love and friendship for them. I love the last one of them as much as I love the first one, and avoid any intimate friendship with anyone but them. My God! (Please) curse those who altered Thy Blessings, accused Thy Prophet, denied Thy verses, mocked Thy appointed Divine Leader, and placed the burden of the people upon the shoulders of the Members of the Holy Household of Muhammad . O God! I seek Thy Nearness by cursing them (your enemies), and by staying away from them in this world and in the Hereafter, O the Beneficent!”Then you should turn towards the position of his feet and say:“O Abal Hassan Ar-Ridha’ ! May God’s Blessings be upon you! O Abal Hassan! May God’s Blessings be upon your spirit and your body! You are truthful - a confirmed truthfulness. You persevered. You were rightful and your rightfulness has been confirmed. May God curse whoever martyred you with his hands and by his tongue.Then supplicate God to help you and curse the murderer of the Commander of the Faithful Ali , the murderer of Al-Hassan , Al-Husayn and all those who murdered Members of the Holy Household of God’s Messenger .”Then you should turn towards the position of his head from behind his back and say two units of prayers. Recite the Chapters ‘Al-Fatihah and ‘Ya-Sin in the first unit, and recite the Chapters ‘Al-Fatiha and ‘Al-Rahman in the second unit. However, if you have not memorized them, recite the Chapter ‘Al-Ikhlas in both units. And pray for the believing men and women, and especially pray for your parents. Also make an effort to recite supplications, cry and pray a lot for yourself, your parents and all your brethren. And stay near the position of his head as much as you wish. And you must say your prayers by the tomb.Then when you decide to depart, recite the following:O Master! O the son of my Master! Peace be upon you! And may God’s Grace and His Blessings be upon you. You are the armour against the Punishment for us. And now it is time for me to leave you, if you permit me. I am neither willing to depart from you, nor to choose anyone else and substitute him for you. And I do not abstain from being near you. Indeed, I made an effort for what came to pass. Indeed I left my family, children and hometown. Then intercede on my behalf on the Day of my need, poverty and destitution: The Day when both my friends and are of no avail; the Day when neither my father nor my mother can avail me anything at all. I ask God - who destined for me to go on pilgrimage to you - to remove my sorrow by you. And I ask God -who destined it for me to depart from your place - to not let this be the last time I make pilgrimage to your tombs, visit your shrine. And I ask God to return me to you. I ask God to make me cry over you so that He may establish it as a means for my salvation and as a savings for the Hereafter. And I ask God to show me your place, guide me towards submission to you, and visit you until I come to you at your Pool (‘Kawthar). I ask God to grant me your companionship in Heaven.“O the one chosen by God! Peace be upon you. Peace be upon the Commander of the Faithful Ali , and the Testamentary Trustee of the Messenger of the Lord of the Two Worlds, and the Leader of the lustrous ones. Peace be upon Al-Hassan and Al-Husayn - the Masters of Youth in Heaven. Peace be upon all the Immaculate Imams .” And you should call out to them by name one by one - may God bless them all and may God’s Grace and His Blessings be upon you. Peace be upon God’s angels that are encircling (the shrine)! Peace be upon God’s angels that are residing (at the shrine) and singing glory - those that act according to His orders! Peace be upon us and upon the servants of God in the ranks of the righteous.O my God! Please do not let this be the last time I visit him (Imam Ar-Ridha’). Imam Ar-Ridha’ deserves more than that. Then please resurrect me with him, and with my forefathers (his forefathers) - those of the past. And my Lord, if you keep me alive then please bestow upon me to go on his pilgrimage to him for as long as I live. Verily, Thou hast power over all things.And say, “I entrust you with God, and I leave you with God, and I pray Him to send Peace upon you. We believe in God, and in what calls us out to Him. O God! Please ‘then write us down amongst those who bear witness.’ O God! (Please) bless me with their love and cordiality for as long as I exist. O son of the Prophet! May peace be upon God’s angels, and upon the visitors to your shrine! May peace be upon me for as long as I exist, and may it last even when I perish. May peace be upon us and upon God’s servants in the ranks of the righteous.”And when you leave and are outside the area from which the dome can be seen, do not turn your face away from it until it goes out of your sight - God willing.This section about the on pilgrimage prayers on the authority of Imam Ar-Ridha’ that can be said when visiting any of the Divine Leaders ."

He said,“Pray in the mosques around the shrine. It suffices that in any of the shrines (of any of the Divine Leaders ) you just say:‘Peace be upon God’s friends and chosen ones. Peace be upon God’s Trustees and His Loved Ones. Peace be upon God’s helpers and His vicegerents. Peace be upon the centers of recognition of the Divine. Peace be upon the sources of God’s remembrance. Peace be upon the ones who have manifested God’s Decrees and what He has admonished mankind against. Peace be upon the ones who call others towards God. Peace be upon the ones firm in the pleasure of God. Peace be upon the ones sincere in obedience to God. Peace be upon the reasons for God (God’s existence). Peace be upon those whose friends are God’s friends and whose enemies are God’s enemies. Peace be upon those whose recognition is the same as recognizing God; and neglecting them is the same as neglecting God. Peace be upon those whose adherence is the same as adhering to God, and those whose abandonment is the same as abandoning God. I swear by God that I submit to whoever submits to you, and fight with whoever fights with you.I believe in what you keep secret and in what you make public. I totally trust you in these affairs. May God’s Curse be upon the enemies of Muhammad’s Household, be they from the genies or from the people, be they from those of old or those of later times. And I acquit myself in the sight of God of them. And may God’s Blessings be upon Muhammad and his Household - the purified ones.’This prayer is sufficient for all pilgrimages to the Holy shrines. Send a lot of blessings upon Muhammad and his Household, and upon the Divine Leaders naming them one by one. Express your disdain for their enemies. Also ask whatever you want for yourself and other believing men and women in your prayers.”Here is another Pilgrimage Prayer for Imam Ar-Ridha’ and all other Divine Leaders called az-Ziyara al-Jame’a or the Major Comprehensive Pilgrimage."

Al-Husayn ibn Ali ibn Abi Talib (Imam al-Hadi) , “O Son of the Prophet of God! Please teach me words to say that are both eloquent and perfect to say whenever I visit anyone of you (the Imams).” Then the Imam said, “Stop when you arrive at the door. Express the two testimonies after you have performed the ritual bathing (Ghusl). And then when you enter and see the tomb, stop and say God is the Greatest thirty times. Then take short steps, be serene and calm, and approach the tomb. Then stop and say God is the Greatest thirty times. Then get closer to the tomb and say God is the Greatest forty times, so that you complete saying it one-hundred times. Then say, ‘Peace be upon you! O Members of the Holy Household of Prophethood, and the holders of the position of the Prophetic mission and the place where angels will come and go: the landing sites for the descension ofrevelations; the Treasurers of Affection; the Treasurers of Knowledge; the limits of patience; the fundamentals of magnanimity; the Commanders of the nations; the Masters of the pious ones; the Sources of benevolence; the Pillars of the company of the good; the Managers of the affairs of the servants (i.e. the people); the Chiefs of the towns; the Gates to belief; the Trustees of the Merciful (God); the Progeny of the Prophets; the Elite of the Messengers; and the best progeny created by the Lord of the Two Worlds. And may God’s Grace and His Blessings be upon you. Peace be upon the leaders towards guidance, the lanterns for darkness, the signs of piety, the possessors of intelligence, and the origins of wisdom. Peace be upon the Divine Leaders (Imams) who are the secure turning point for mankind; the inheritors of the Prophets; the best similitude and the best call; and the Proofs of God to the people in the Hereafter and this world. And may God’s Grace and His Blessings be upon you.Peace be upon the centers of Divine Recognition; the sources of God’s Blessings; the Treasurers of God’s Wisdom; the Guardians of God’s Secrets; the carriers of God’s Book; the Trustees of God’s Prophet, and the Progeny of God’s Messenger . And may God’s Grace and His Blessings be upon you.Peace be upon the Callers to God; the Directors towards God’s Satisfaction; the Steadfast ones in Divine Decrees and in what He has admonished mankind against; the Ones filled with the love of God; the Sincere ones in their belief in God’s Unity; the Ones who manifest Divine Decrees, and what He has admonished mankind against; the Noble servants who never proclaim anything other than what He has declared, and those that act according to His Orders! And may God’s Grace and His Blessings be upon you.Peace be upon the Divine Leaders (Imams) who invite; the Commanders to the right guidance and the Masters of the believers; and the Defenders of the rights of the oppressed; and the People who remember (God); and the Possessors of authority; and God’s Remainders (the Imams); His chosen ones and His party; the Base of His Knowledge; and His Reason; and His path; and His Light, and His Proof. May God’s Grace and His Blessings be upon you.I bear witness that there is no god but God and there are no partners for Him, as that is God’s Testimony for Himself; and that is His Angels testimony for Him; and the testimony of His Possessors of Knowledge (divine leaders) among His creatures for Him. I bear witness that there is no god but Him the Honorable the Wise. And I bear witness that Muhammad is His servant - the chosen one and his Messenger - the content one. He has sent him (the Prophet Muhammad (S)) with Guidance and the Religion of Truth, so that he may proclaim it to be superior over all other religions, even though the pagans may detest it. And I bear witness that you are the Divine Leaders (Imams) who walk in righteousness; the ones who guide; the Infallible ones; the highly honored ones; the close ones (to God); the pious ones; and the truthful ones. You are the chosen ones and the ones obedient to God. You are the ones steadfast to His Decrees. You are the ones who act according to His Will. You are the triumphant ones due to His Nobility. You are chosen by His Knowledge. You are pleased with His Religion. And you are chosen to safekeep His Secrets. You are chosen by His Power. And you are honored by His Guidance. You are dedicated to be His Proof, and you are chosen for His Illumination. You are approved of by His Spirit, and He has approved of your Divine Leadership on His Earth. He has established you as His Proofs for His creatures; and as Helpers of His Religion; as Guardians of His Secrets; and as Treasures of His Knowledge; and as a Depository of His Wisdom; as Translators of His Revelations; as the Pillars of His Unity; and as Witnesses over His creatures; as signs for His servants; and as Landmarks in His towns; and as Conductors on His Way. God protected you (the Imams) from making mistakes, secured you from sedition, purified you from impurities, cleansed you of any uncleanliness and purified you - What a purification! Then you glorified His Magnificence, and held high His Rank. You praised His Magnanimity, continued His Remembrance, stressed His Covenant, and strengthened the bonds of His Obedience. You guided others in secret and in public towards Him, and invited others to His Path through wisdom and eloquent sermons. You gave your lives to please Him. You suffered any calamities that befell you due to being on His Side. You established the prayers. You paid the alms-tax. You advised to do what is right, and you admonished against what is wrong to do. You struggled in the way of God in the best manner, until you made His Call public; clarified what He has made obligatory; established His Limits;disseminated His Jurisprudence; and clearly expressed His Traditions. You went to Him and in doing so you submitted to what He had destined for youy and acknowledged His previously-sent Messengers.Therefore, whoever turns away from you is an apostate, and whoever stays with you joins you. Whoever neglects your rights will perish. The Truth is with you, in you, from you, and goes towards you. You are the people of the Truth, and its Treasure. The inheritance of the Prophets is with you. The return of the people is to you, their reckoning is with you, and the elucidation of the message is carried out by you.God’s verses are with you, and His Obedience is accomplished through you. His Light and Proof are with you. His Decrees are entrusted to you. Whoever is your friend is indeed God’s friend. Whoever is your enemy is indeed God’s enemy. Whoever loves you indeed loves God. Whoever adheres to you has indeed adhered to God. You are the most direct path towards God. You are the witnesses in this ephemeral abode, and are the ones who intercede in the eternal abode. You are the continuous mercy, the stored signs, and the protected Trusteeship. You are the gate through which people are tested. Whoever comes to you is saved, and whoever does not gets destroyed. You call out to God, and reason on His Behalf. You believe in Him, submit to Him, act according to His Decrees and direct us towards His Path. You rule according to His Words.I swear by God that whoever makes friends with you becomes prosperous; whoever becomes your enemy is destroyed; and whoever denies you fails; whoever separates from you goes astray; whoever adheres to you becomes victorious; whoever takes refuge in you is safe and sound; whoever acknowledges you attains peace; whoever comes under your custody is guided; whoever follows you, his abode will be in Paradise; whoever opposes you, his dwelling place will be in the Fire; whoever denies you is an unbeliever; whoever fights with you is a polytheist; and whoever rejects you will have the lowest rank in the Fire. I bear witness that these issues have held true for you in the past as they will hold true for the rest of time. I bear witness that your spirits, light, and nature are all the same. Each of you have obtained health and purity from the others. God created you as rays of light. Then He set you up encircling His Throne, until He favored us with you. Then He placed you in homes which God permitted to be honored and in which His Name ismentioned. And He established our supplications to you; and our loving you which He has made unique to us as a means of goodness of our temper; cleanliness of ourselves; purification of us; and as an expiation for our sins since we acknowledge your nobility near Him and are known to acknowledge you. Thus may God grant you the most honorable position among those held in honor and the highest mansions of those nearest to God; and the highest ranks among the Trustees of the Messengers where no one who is not deserving can reach and no transgressor can attain supremacy; no rival can triumph; and no greedy one can be voracious to obtain. So then there remains no nearby-stationed angels, Messengers, trusted friends, martyrs, scholars, ignorant ones, debased ones, noble ones, good believers, vicious villains, obstinate oppressors, or disobedient Satans, nor any creature amongst them remains as a witness, unless God makes them realize the loftiness of your decrees; the exaltedness of your significance; the greatness of your rank; and the perfection of your light; the truthfulness of your positions; the firmness of your standing; the honor of your position and your residence near Him; your being honored by Him; and your being especial in His court; and the extent of the closeness of your position near Him.May my father, mother, spouse, property, and family be your ransom! May God and you bear witness that I believe in you and what you believe in. I renounce your enemies, and that by which they have disowned you. I am fully aware of your status, and of the deviation of those who oppose you. I am your friend and a friend of your friends. I despise your enemies and am their adversary. I am at peace with those who are at peace with you. I am at war with those who are at war with you. I accept as true whatever you verify, and consider as false whatever you refute. I obey you. I recognize your rightfulness. I confess to your nobility. I carry your knowledge. I seek protection under your shelter. I confess to you. I believe that you will return. I testify to your promised return. I am awaiting your orders. I am awaiting your reign. I hold fast to what you have said. I carry out your orders. I take shelter in your neighborhood. I go on pilgrimage to you. I seek refuge in you since for me your ’resting abodes’ are sanctuaries. I ask God the Honorable the Exalted for your intercession, and I seek nearness to Him through you. Under all circumstances I put the first priority on you rather than my wants, needs,desires and all affairs. I am a believer in what you have kept as secrets and what you have made public, in your presence and absence - your first one (i.e. absence or ‘Ghaybat) and your last one. I entrust all my affairs in this regard to you. And I submit to God in this regard along with you. And I whole-heartedly believe in you. My viewpoints agree with yours. I am ready to assist you until God the Highest revives His Religion through you (the Al-Mahdi ); and brings you back during His Days; and makes you victorious for the sake of His Justice; and makes you powerful on His Earth. Then I am with you. I am not with your enemies. I believe in you. I love the last one (Imam) of you just as much as I love the first one.I acquit myself in the sight of God of your enemies; of sorcery and evil; the Satans; and their party that is oppressive to you; and of the ones who denied your rightfulness; the apostates who turn away from your Divine Leadership; the ones who usurped the authority which you inherited; and of the ones who doubted in you; the ones who deviated from you. And I acquit myself of all intimate friends but you; and of obeying anyone but you; and of the leaders who invite us towards the Fire. May God make me steadfast in your assistance, friendship, love, and religion for as long as I live. May He grant me success in obeying you, grant me your intercession on my behalf, and establish me as one of your best followers who follow what you have invited them to. And establish me as one who investigates your traces and trots on your path; is guided by your guidance; is resurrected amongst you; returns when you return; attains rule in your government; is honored due to your health; gets established during your time; and gets pleased to see you. May my father, mother, spouse, property, and possessions be your ransom! Whoever desired to reach God started out with you. And whoever considers Him to be the One and Only has accepted this belief from you. And whoever intended to go towards Him was directed towards you. O my Masters! Your praise is beyond measure. Your true nature is beyond praise. Your majesty is beyond description. And you are the light of the Company of the Good. And you are the true guidance for the pious, and the proofs of the Omnipotent. God has initiated everything with you, and He shall terminate everything with you. He will send down rain due to you. For your sake, He will prevent the sky from collapsing down onto the Earth without His Permission. He will remove the sorrows through you.And He will solve the difficulties through you. And whatever He has sent down to His Messenger which the angels have brought down to him (Muhammad) is with you (the Imams). And the Spirit of Faith and Truth (Gabriel) - was dispatched to your forefather (the Prophet Muhammad (S)).[And if you are visiting the shrine of the Commander of the Faithful - Imam Ali say:And the Spirit of Faith and Truth - was dispatched to your brother (implying the Prophet Muhammad (S).]God has granted you what He would not grant to any of the people of the Two Worlds. All the noble ones bow down to your dignity. And all the arrogant ones humble themselves in your obedience. And all the powerful people yield to your nobility. All things yield themselves to you. The Earth is brightened with your light. The triumphant ones become victorious due to your friendship. One can trot towards Paradise with your assistance. And the Wrath of God Most Gracious is upon those who disclaim your Trusteeship. May my father, mother, myself, my spouse and my property be your ransom!You are remembered as other people are remembered. Your names are mentioned amongst other people’s names. Your corpses are buried amongst other people’s corpses. Your spirits are amongst other people’s spirits. Your souls are amongst other souls. Your traces are amongst other traces. Your tombs are among other tombs. How delightful are your names! And how noble are your souls! How majestic is your honor! How exalted is your significance! How honored are your promises! Your words are similar to light! Your decrees are a basis for growth! Your advice is to be God-fearing! And your deeds are good! Your habits are kindnesses!Your nature is generosity! Your concerns are truth, honesty and moderation! Your words are full of wisdom and are binding! Your opinions are full of knowledge, patience and wisdom! Indeed, whenever there is a mention of goodness, you are the first, the next, the source, and the termination of goodness!May my father, mother, myself, my spouse and my property be your ransom! How can I describe the charm of your praise? How can I measurethe nobility of your rank? And God has taken us out of the state of humiliation, has removed from us over-abundance of anguish, and He has saved us from the verge of the cliff of destruction and the Fire.May my father, mother, and myself be your ransom! God taught us the secrets of our religion due to our following you. And He improved those of our worldly affairs that had become ruined. And due to our following you, the Word was perfected, the blessings were increased, and disunion was converted into union. God accepted our obligatory deeds from us because we follow you. And cordiality for you is obligatory, and you have high ranks, and a commendable station before God the Highest and a known place, a great high rank, a high status, and accepted intercession. Our Lord! we believe in what Thou hast revealed, and we follow the Apostle; then write our names down among those who bear witness. Our Lord! (they say), Let not our hearts deviate now after Thou hast guided us, but grant us mercy from Thine own Presence; for Thou art the Grantor of bounties without measure. Glory be to our Lord! Truly has the promise of our Lord been fulfilled!O friend of God [O friends of God]! Indeed there are sins in between me and God that cannot be removed unless you approve of that. I ask you by the One who has established you as His Trustees of His Secrets and has entrusted the affairs of His creatures to you, and has equated your obedience with His own obedience to kindly implore forgiveness for my sins, and be the ones who intercede on my behalf as I am obedient to you and whoever is obedient to you has indeed obeyed God.Whoever disobeys you is disobedient to God. And whoever loves you has indeed loved God. And whoever despises you has indeed loathed God.O God! Could I ever have found ones to intercede with Thee on my behalf who would be closer to Thee than Muhammad and the Members of his Household - the leaders of the Company of the Good and the pious ones? I beseech Thee by their right (the Divine Leaders) that Thou establish them as the ones to intercede on my behalf.I ask Thee to place me amongst those who know them (the Divine Leaders) and recognize their rightfulness - and amongst those who hope for their intercession - as Thou art the Most Merciful of those that are merciful. And may God’s Blessings and Salutations with much respect be upon our Master Muhammad and his Household. And God sufficeth for us, and He is the best disposer of affairs.Then when you decide to depart, recite the following:O Members of the Holy Prophet’s Household! Peace be upon you! Peace be upon one who says farewell, but is neither tired of you nor is he discontented with you.And may God’s Grace and His Blessings be upon you - as He is indeed Praiseworthy and Glorious. Peace be upon you from a friend who is neither willing to depart from you; nor to choose anyone else and substitute him for you; one who does not stray away from you; and one who does not abstain from being near you.May God not let this be the last time I make pilgrimage to your tomb and visit your shrine. And peace be upon you. May God resurrect me amongst you; make me be one who enters your Pool Kawthar); let me join your party; please you with me; empower me from your government; and revive me during your return; and give me a position during your rule. And may God grant me gratitude for my efforts for you; and forgive me for my sins due to your intercession; overlook my faults due to your love; increase my eminence due to my adherence to you; revere me due to my obedience to you; and honor me due to your guidance.And when I return home please make me successful with a happy ending, a winner, in good shape, healthy, wealthy, and having attained the satisfaction of God and His Grace and with better things than what God would normally return your visitors, friends, lovers, and followers with.And may God grant me another chance to return on pilgrimage after I arrive home as long as my Lord keeps me alive with a sincere intention, faith, piety, humbleness, and legitimate, prolonged and pure sustenance.O my God! Please do not let this be the last time I visit them, remember them and supplicate to them. And please make forgiveness; the good; blessings; light; faith; and fair acceptance of my prayers a certainty for me - just as Thee has done so for Thy friends who have recognized the truth about them (the Prophet’s Household); consider it incumbent upon themselves to obey the Imams; are inclined to visit the Imams; and are close to Thee and them. May my father, mother, family, property, and possessions be your ransom! Please pay attention to me and let me join your party. Include me amongst those on whose behalf you intercede,and mention me in the presence of your Lord. O my God! Please send blessings upon Muhammad and the Household of Muhammad . And express my greetings to their souls and their bodies. And peace be upon you; and may God’s Grace and His Blessings be upon you. And may God’s Blessings, and Salutations with much respect be upon our Master Muhammad and his Household. And God sufficeth for us, and He is the best disposer of affairs."

Then I saw lights radiating from the Shrine towards the sky that had filled up the entire Shrine illuminating the whole area as if it was daytime. I was in doubt about the affairs of Ar-Ridha’ , and did not believe that he was right. My mother who opposed him too, told me, ‘O my son! What is the matter with you?’ Then I told her, ‘I see lights that are radiating from the Shrine towards the sky that have filled up the Shrine in Sanabad.’ Then my mother told me, ‘This is impossible. This is one of the acts of Satan.’”Muhammad ibn Umar Al-Nowqani also said, “On another night that was even darker than before, I saw a similar light and the Shrine was completely illuminated with that light. Then I informed my mother about this, and brought her to that place so that she could see the light with her own eyes which the Shrine was filled up. She glorified this, and started to praise God. She, however, did not believe as I did. Then I set out towards the Shrine, and found its door closed. Then I said to myself, ‘O my God! If the Divine Leadership of Ar-Ridha’ is genuine, then open this door.’ Then I pushed against the door with my hand and it opened up. Then I told myself, ‘Perhaps this door was not closed at all, and I have made a mistake.’Then I closed the door and made sure that it could only be opened with a key. Then I said, ‘O my God! If the Divine Leadership of Ar-Ridha’ is genuine, then open this door.’ Then I pushed against the door with my hand and it opened up again. I entered, visited the Shrine, said the pilgrimage prayers, and was enlightened about the Divine Leadership of Ar-Ridha’ . From then on, I went on pilgrimage to the Shrine from Nowqan (in the land of Khorasan) every Friday night and prayed near him (Ar-Ridha’’s tomb) up until the present.”"

Then God the Honorable the Exalted granted me a son. Then I went to Aba Mansoor and informed him that God the Highest had fulfilled my prayer in this Shrine, favored me, granted me a son and honored me there upon.”The author of this book (a.s.heikh Sadooq) said, “I asked Rokn ul-Dowleh - the ruler - for permission to go on pilgrimage to the Shrine of Ar-Ridha’ . He issued the permit in the (Arabic) month of Rajab of the year 352 A.H. (962 A.D.), and handed it over to me. When I left there, he called me in and said, “This is a blessed Shrine which I have already visited. I asked God the Highest for my personal needs and He fulfilled all of them for me. I ask you not to forget to pray for me there, and that you visit Ar-Ridha’ on my behalf, since indeed prayers would be fulfilled in that Shrine. Then I promised him that I would pray for him, and I fulfilled my promise. When I returned from that place (the Shrine) - may peace and greetings be upon its resident - and went to see him (Rukn ad-Dawla), he asked me, “Did you pray for me?” Then I said, “Yes.” Then he told me, “Excellent! Indeed it has been proven to me that prayers said in that Shrine are fulfilled.”"

He was extremely biased and I had never met anyone more biased than him before. He used to say, “O God! Blessings be upon Muhammad alone.” He refused to send blessings upon the Members of the Prophet’s Holy Household. He narrated that he had heard from Aba Bakr al-Hammamy al-Farra’ - one of the tradition narrators - in a place called Sekkat el-Harb in Neishaboor in Khorasasn - the following, “Someone had entrusted me with some property which I buried in the ground. Later on, I forgot where I had buried that property. I was confused and did not know what to do. The property’s owner accused me of having stolen it. Then I left my house in grief wondering what to do. I saw a group of people who were traveling towards the Shrine of Ar-Ridha’ . Then I went to Mashhad along with them, and prayed to God the Honorable the Exalted to help me remember where I had buried what was entrusted to my care. Then when I was there I had a dream. I saw someone come and tell me, “You buried what you were entrusted with in such and such a location.” Then I returned to the property owner and directed him towards the location I had seen in my dream, while I did not myself believe in what I had dreamt. Then the property owner set out for that location, dug up the ground, and found his property still sealed up as he had done so when he had given it to me. From then on, the owner of the property used to express this experience to the people and encourage them to visit the Shrine in Mashhad - may greetings and peace be upon its resident (Imam Ridha’)."

Abal Hassan Ali prayed there alone until late at night when he got tired.Then he sat down and put his head on his knees to rest for a while. When he raised up his head, he saw two lines of poetry in Arabic inscribed on the wall in front of him:Whoever wishes to visit a tombWhose visitors God shall free from any anguish,Should come to this tomb in which God Has put to restSomeone from the progeny of the Prophet.Abal Hassan Ali added, “Then I stood up and prayed until dawn. Then I sat down again just as I had done so before, and put my head on my knees to rest. Then when I raised my head to look up at the wall, I saw nothing else inscribed on the wall. What was written there had not even dried up, as if it had been written just then. I stayed there until the morning when the door was opened and I went out there from.”"

One of them was from Ray and the other one was from Qum. The one from Qum was from an old group of Nasibites in Qum. The other one who was from Ray was a Shiite.When they reached Neishaboor, the man from Ray told the other man from Qum, “Should we first go to visit the Shrine of Ar-Ridha’ and then head towards Bokhara?” The man from Qum said, “Indeed, we have been appointed by our ruler as representatives to go to Bokhara, and we are not allowed to do anything else until we finish our mission.” They set out for Bokhara, performed their mission and returned. Then they reached Toos. Then the man from Ray asked the other one from Qum, “Shouldn’t we go visit the Shrine of Ar-Ridha’ ?” The man from Qum replied, “I have left Qum as a Sunni. I shall not return there as a Shiite.” The man from Ray entrusted him with all his properties and animals, rode on a donkey, and set out for the Shrine of Ar-Ridha’ . He told the Shrine servants, “Please let me stay inside the shrine tonight and leave the keys with me.” They did so. He said, “I went into the Shrine, locked the door and visited Ar-Ridha’ . Then I stood up at the position of the Imam’s head, and prayed as much as God the Highest had willed. Then I started to recite the Qur’an from the beginning.” He added, “I heard a voice reciting the Qur’an just as I did. I stopped reciting the Qur’an, visited all parts of the Shrine, and looked around all the areas, but I did not find anyone there. Then I returned to my previous position and started reciting the Qur’an from the very beginning. Again, I heard that voice reciting the Qur’an along with me reciting as I did, until I reached the end of the Chapter Mary, when I recited it as ‘Yoma Nahshor al-Mottaqoon ilar Rahman wafdan va nasooq ul-Mojremeen ila jahannama wirda’ to the end. However, I heard the voice coming from the tomb recite that part of the Qur’an as follows: ‘Yoma yohshar al-Mottaqoon ilar Rahman wafdan wa yusaq ul-Mojremoon ila jahannama wirda’ to the end. I continued reciting the Qur’an as the voice did, until we finished reciting the whole Qur’an. Then when the morning came, I returned to Nowqan. I asked the Qur’an reciters about this form of reciting the above Qur’anic verse. They said, “This is a correct form of recital and is correct in meaning. However, we know of no one who has recited it in this way.” The man added, “Then I went to Neishaboor and asked about this form of recitation of the above verse from the reciters there. None of them knew anything about it. Then I returned to Ray and asked a few of the reciters about this form of recitation, ‘Yo’ma yohshar al-Mottaqoon ilar Rahman wafdan wa yusaq ul-Mojremoon ila jahannama wirda’ to the end. One of the reciters asked me, “Where did you hear this?”Then I told him, “Something has happened to me due to which I must recognize what has been recited to me.” Then he said, “This is the way the Prophet of God recited it as it has been narrated by the Members of the Holy Household .” Then he asked me to tell him why I wanted to know about this form of recitation of the verse. Then I told him what had happened to me, and accepted this form of recitation to be the correct form."

narrated that Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Sinani al-Neishaboori said, “I was at the service of the military Commander-in-Chief, Abi Nasr ibn Abi Ali al-Saghani, who treated me with kindness. I accompanied him to Saghanian. His companions were jealous of me due to the way he treated me with kindness. Once he handed me a closed bag in which there were three-thousand Dirhams to turn over to his treasurer. Then I left him, sat down in a place where his gate-keeper sat, and placed the bag on the ground right in front of me. I was talking about my job with the people when the bags were stolen. I did not know what to do. The commander had a servant named Khat-lakh Tash who was present there. When I looked and saw that the bag was missing, I asked those who were present there about it. They all denied knowing anything about it and said, ‘You did not place anything here. You are just accusing us.’ I knew they were jealous of me. I did not wish to tell the Commander, Abi Nasr al-Saghani, about this worrying that he might accuse me of stealing. I was wondering and thinking about who might have stolen the bag from me. Whenever my father was grieved about something, he used to go to the Shrine of Ar-Ridha’ , visit him and pray to God the Highest near him . This was usually enough of a let-out and he would get relieved.The following day I went to see the Commander, and said, ’O Commander! Will you grant me permission to go to Toos? I have something to do there.’ He asked, ‘What do you have to do there?’ I said, ’I have a slave from Toos who has escaped. I have lost the bag that you had entrusted me with to turn over your treasurer. I suspect that he has stolen it?’ The Commander said, ‘Be careful not to ruin your position near me.’ I said, ’I take refuge in God from this.’ He asked, ‘Who will guarantee that you will not put off the repayment of the money in that bag?’ I said, ‘You can confiscate my house and my property, if I do not return after forty days.’ Then the Commander wrote a letter to Abil Hassan Al-Khoza’ee to confiscate all my property in Toos, and granted me permission to leave. I went from one way-station to the next until I arrived at the Shrine in Mashhad - may peace be upon its resident. Then I visited the Shrine and prayed to God the Highest at the position of the Imam’s head to let me know about the whereabouts of the bag. Then I fell asleep there. Then I saw God’s Prophet (S) in my dream. He said, ‘Stand up. God answered your prayer and fulfilled your need.’ I woke up, made ablutions and recited a lot of supplications - as many as God the Highest had willed. I also said the obligatory prayers. Then I fell asleep again, and saw God’s Prophet (S) in my dreams. The Prophet (S) told me, ‘Khat-lakh Tash has stolen it and buried it under the furnace in his house. It is still sealed and closed up with the seal of Abi Nasr Al-Saqani.’ Then (after I woke up) I returned to Commander Abi Nasr three days before my time was over. I went to see him and said, ‘My need was fulfilled.’ Then he said, ’Praise be to God.’ Then I left him, changed my clothes and returned to him. He asked, ‘Where is the bag?’ I answered, ‘The bag is with Khat-lakh Tash.’ He asked, ‘How do you know that?’ I said, ‘God’s Prophet (S) informed me about that in my dreams when I was at the tomb of Ar-Ridha’ .’ The Commander’s body shivered, and he ordered Khat-lakh Tash to be brought to him and asked him, ‘Do you have the bag that you took?’ He denied it as he was one of the Commander’s dearest servants. The Commander then ordered that he be beaten up. I said, ‘O commander! There is no need to order that he be beaten up, since God’s Prophet (S) also told me about the location where he had placed it.’ The Commander asked, ‘Where is it?’ I said, ‘It is in his house buried under the furnace and is still sealed with the Commander’s seal.’ The Commander sent a trustworthy man to Khat-lakh Tash’s house and ordered that they dig up the ground where the furnace was located.The man went to Khat-lakh Tash’s house, dug up the ground and brought out the sealed bag. He took it back and placed it in front of the Commander. When the commander looked at the bag with his seal still on it, he told me, ‘O Abal Nasr! I did not know about your nobility before. I will increase your salary, respect and honor. Had I known that you intended to go to Mashhad, I would have had you ride on one of my horses.’” Abal Nasr added, “I was fearful of the Turks around him, and that they may get jealous of what had happened to me, and cause me trouble. Therefore, I requested the Commander’s permission to leave and returned to Neishaboor. I stayed in my store selling hay up until now. And there is no power save in God.”"

I asked him for permission to go visit Ar-Ridha’ , since it was Thursday. He said, “Let me tell you something about this town Mashhad. When I was young I was biased against the people of Mashhad, used to disturb the visitors on their way, seized their clothes and belongings. One day I went out to hunt. I sent my cheetah after a deer. The cheetah kept chasing the deer until the deer took refuge inside the Shrine. Then the deer stopped. The cheetah stopped right in front of it. It would not get any closer to the deer. Then no matter how hard I tried to force the cheetah to get closer to the deer, it did not obey me. Whenever the deer moved, the cheetah would just follow it until the deer reached inside the Shrine. Then the cheetah returned. The deer entered one of the recesses in the Shrine walls. I went into the yard but, could not see the deer. Then I asked Abil Nasr al-Moqri’, ‘Where did the deer which just came here go?’ He said, ‘I did not see it.’ Then I went where the deer had gone. I could see traces of it and its urination, but could not see the deer itself, and lost it. Then I made a bet with God the Highest to never again bother the pilgrims, or stop them unless I wanted to do them good. From then on whenever I had a need I went to Mashhad, visited Ar-Ridha’ , and asked God the Highest to fulfill my need. And God always answered my prayers and fulfilled my needs. There I asked God the Highest to grant me a son and He granted me one. He grew up and matured and then he was killed.Then I went to the Shrine in Mashhad again and asked God the Highest to grant me another son. God granted me another son. There have been no occasions on which I have asked God the Highest for something in the Shrine which God has not fulfilled. And this was all due to the blessings of this Shrine - may peace be upon its resident.”"

A man passed by. Then he told his servant, ‘Go after this man and take him to my house and keep him there until I come back.’ When Commander Hamawayh returned home, he sat down to eat, with some of the high-ranking officials. Then when they sat down at the table to eat, he asked his servant, ‘Where is that man?’ The servant said, ‘He is standing at the door.’ Hamawayh said, ‘Let him come in.’ When the man entered Commander Hamawayh ordered that they bring a pan of water and said, ‘Wash this man’s hands and have him sit at the table.’ When they had finished eating, he asked the man, ‘Do you have any animals to ride on?’ The man said, ‘No.’ The Commander then ordered that he be given a donkey. Then the Commander asked him, ‘Do you have enough money for your travel expenses?’ The man said, ‘No.’ Then the Commander ordered that one-thousand Dirhams and two saddlebags and travel necessities be prepared for him. They gave it all to him. Then Hamawayh looked at the high-ranking officials and asked them, ‘Do you know who this man is?’ They said, ‘No.’ Hamawayh said, ‘Know that when I was young, I went to visit Ar-Ridha’ in worn-out clothes. I saw this man in the Shrine. I was praying to God the Highest beside the tomb asking him to grant me the post of governorship of Khorasan. This man was praying next to me to get what I have now prepared for him today. Since I have seen the good fulfillment of prayers by God the Highest due to the blessings of this Shrine, I really loved to see God the Highest grant me the opportunity to be the one to fulfill this man’s prayers with my own hands due to the blessings of this Shrine. However, there is a case concerning him and I for which I must retaliate.’ The high-ranking officials asked, ‘What is it?’ The Commander said, ‘This man saw me in the Shrine in those worn-out clothes. He heard what great things I waspraying for. He considered me too young at that time to be expecting such great things. Then he kicked me and asked me, ‘How can a person in your state be so greedy as to expect to become Khorasan’s governor and the Commander of the army.’ The top ranking officials said, ‘O Commander! Please forgive him for having perfected your kindness to him.’ The Commander said, ‘Of course, I forgave him.’ From then on, Hamawayh went to visit the Shrine. He married off his own daughter to Zayd ibn Muhammad ibn Ziyad al-Alawi after his father - may God be pleased with him - had been killed in war in Gorgan. He transferred Zayd to his own palace and granted him as many blessings as he should have, and this was all due to the blessings of this Shrine. Also when Abul Husayn Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn Ziyad al-Alawi - may God have mercy upon him - rebelled and twenty-thousand people from Neishaboor pledged allegiance to him, he was arrested by the Caliph, and then dispatched to Bokhara. Then Hamawayh entered, removed the chains from Zayd and said to the Commander of Khorasan, ‘Those 20,000 people are from the progeny of God’s Prophet (S) who are hungry! It is incumbent upon you to maintain them, so that they are not forced to rebel in order to feed themselves. Then the Commander set a monthly salary for Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Alawi. He freed him and returned him to Neishaboor. This resulted in the designation of dues for the noble ones (a.s.ayyids) in Bokhara as a tradition. And this was all due to the blessings of this Shrine - may peace be upon its resident.”"

Then I saw a Turkish man enter the Shrine and stand up at the position of the Imam’s head. He cried and prayed in Turkish, and said, ‘O my Lord! If my son is alive, please bring us together. However, if he has died, please let me know.’ I knew Turkish. Then I asked him, ‘What is the matter?’ He said, ‘I had a son who was with me in the Battle of IsshaqAbad. I lost him there and have had no news of him. His mother cries for him day and night. I have come here to pray to God the Highest to solve this problem, since I have heard that prayers said in this Shrine get fulfilled.’ Then I felt sorry for him. I took his hands and took him out of the Shrine to act as his host that day.Once we left the mosque, we ran into a tall, young man who had just started to grow a mustache and was wearing patched clothes. When the Turkish man saw him, he jumped towards him, hugged him and cried. They both recognized each other. This was just the son for whom he was praying in Ar-Ridha’’s tomb to God the Highest to be united with, or be informed of his whereabouts. I (Abul Abbas Ahmad) asked the son, ‘How did you get here?” The son said, ‘After the Battle of IsshaqAbad, I ended up in Tabaristan. A man from Daylam Abad took me to his house and raised me. Now that I have grown up, I have set out to find my parents about whose whereabouts I had no information. I was accompanying a group of people, since I did not know the way until I reached here.’ Then the Turkish man said, ‘I saw what has made my belief in this Shrine certain due to this tomb. Now I promise myself not to part with it for as long as I live.’”And praise be to God, the First and the Last, and the Ascendant (over all) and the Knower of hidden things. And blessings and peace be upon His Prophet and His Loved one Muhammad - the chosen one and his Household - blessings and many salutations with all respect."
