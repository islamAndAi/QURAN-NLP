Kitāb al-Ghayba,The Book of Occultation,,Abū ʿAbd Allah Muḥammad b. Ibrāhīm al-Nuʿmānī,Abdullah al-Shahin,"Kitāb al-Ghayba, written by al-Shaykh Muḥammad b. Ibrāhīm al-Nuʿmānī is a vital work regarding the occultation of the 12th Imam (a). This is for a variety of reasons, the first of which is considering the early authorship of this work— which seems to have been penned very shortly after the end of the minor occultation. Additionally, al-Nuʿmānī had the privilege of acquiring Ḥadīth from the great scholar al-Shaykh al-Kulaynī. The work itself consists of approximately 478 narrations which are spread across twenty-six chapters. The narrations themselves span a variety of topics, from discussions on the Imamate, the hardships and trials of the Shīʿa, signs of the Imam’s reappearance, and matters that speak of the nature of the governance of the Imam post-occultation. The traditions are chaptered in an excellent manner, making it easy for the reader to navigate— yet unlike other works written in this genre, the author rarely comments on the traditions within and allow them to speak for themselves.",1 | Introduction,Chapter 1 | Introduction,Ḥadīth #1,"الحمد لله رب العالمين، الهادي من يشاء إلى صراط مستقيم، المستحق الشكر من عباده بإخراجه إياهم من العدم إلى الوجود، وتصويره إياهم في أحسن الصور، وإسباغه عليهم النعم ظاهرة وباطنة لا يحصيها العدد على طول الأمد، كما قال عز وجل: (وإن تعدوا نعمت الله لا تحصوها) ((2))، وبما دلهم عليه وأرشدهم إليه من العلم بربوبيته، والإقرار بوحدانيته، بالعقول الزكية، والحكمة البالغة، والصنعة المتقنة، والفطرة الصحيحة، والصبغة الحسنة، والآيات الباهرة، والبراهين الظاهرة، وشفعه ذلك ببعثه إليهم الخيرة من خلقه رسلا مصطفين، مبشرين ومنذرين، دالين هادين، مذكرين ومحذرين، ومبلغين مؤدين، بالعلم ناطقين، وبروح القدس مؤيدين، وبالحجج غالبين، وبالآيات لأهل الباطل قاهرين، وبالمعجزات لعقول ذوي الألباب باهرين، أبانهم من خلقه بما أولاهم من كرامته، وأطلعهم على غيبه، ومكنهم فيه من قدرته، كما قال عز وجل: (عالم الغيب فلا يظهر على غيبه أحدا * إلا من ارتضى من رسول فإنه يسلك من بين يديه ومن خلفه رصدا) ((1)) ترفعا لأقدارهم، وتعظيما لشأنهم، لئلا يكون للناس على الله حجة بعد الرسل، ولتكون حجة الله عليهم تامة غير ناقصة. والحمد لله الذي من علينا بمحمد سابق بريته إلى الإقرار بربوبيته، وخاتم أصفيائه، إنذارا برسالته، وأحب أحبائه إليه، وأكرم أنبيائه عليه، وأعلاهم رتبة لديه، وأخصهم منزلة منه، أعطاه جميع ما أعطاهم، وزاده أضعافا على ما أتاهم، وأحله المنزلة التي أظهر بها فضله عليهم، فصيره إماما لهم، إذ صلى في سمائه بجماعتهم، وشرف مقامه على كافتهم، وأعطاه الشفاعة دونهم، ورفعه مستسيرا إلى علو ملكوته ((2)) حتى كلمه في محل جبروته بحيث جاز مراتب الملائكة المقربين، ومقامات الكروبيين والحافين. وأنزل عليه كتابا جعله مهيمنا على كتبه المتقدمة، ومشتملا على ما حوته من العلوم الجمة وفاضلا عليها بأن جعله كما قال تعالى: (تبيانا لكل شئ) ((3)) لم يفرط فيه من شئ، فهدانا الله عز وجل بمحمد (صلى الله عليه وآله) من الضلالة والعمى، وأنقذنا به من الجهالة والردى، وأغنانا به وبما جاء به من الكتاب المبين، وما أكمله لنا من الدين، ودلنا عليه من ولاية الأئمة الطاهرين الهادين - عن الآراء والاجتهاد، ووفقنا ((1)) به وبهم إلى سبيل الرشاد. صلى الله عليه وعلى أخيه أمير المؤمنين تاليه في الفضل، ومؤازره في اللأواء والأزل ((2))، وسيف الله على أهل الكفر والجهل، ويده المبسوطة بالإحسان والعدل، والسالك نهجه في كل حال، والزائل مع الحق حيث ما زال، والخازن علمه، والمستودع سره، الظاهر على مكنون أمره، وعلى الأئمة من آله الطاهرين، الأخيار الطيبين الأبرار. معادن الرحمة، ومحل النعمة، وبدور الظلام، ونور الأنام، وبحور العلم، وباب السلام الذي ندب الله عز وجل خلقه إلى دخوله، وحذرهم النكوب عن سبيله حيث قال: (يا أيها الذين آمنوا ادخلوا في السلم كافة ولا تتبعوا خطوات الشيطان إنه لكم عدو مبين) ((3)) أفضل صلواته وأشرفها، وأزكاها وأنماها، وأتمها وأعلاها وأسناها، وسلم تسليما كثيرا كما هو أهله وكما محمد وآله (عليهم السلام) أهله منه. أما بعد: فإنا رأينا طوائف من العصابة المنسوبة إلى التشيع، المنتمية إلى نبيها محمد وآله صلى الله عليهم - ممن يقول بالإمامة التي جعلها الله برحمته دين الحق، ولسان الصدق، وزينا لمن دخل فيها، ونجاة وجمالا لمن كان من أهلها، وفاز بذمتها، وتمسك بعقدتها، ووفى لها بشروطها، من المواظبة على الصلوات، وإيتاء الزكوات، والمسابقة إلى الخيرات، واجتناب الفواحش والمنكرات، والتنزه عن سائر المحظورات، ومراقبة الله تقدس ذكره في الملأ والخلوات، وتشغل القلوب وإتعاب الأنفس والأبدان في حيازة القربات -، قد تفرقت كلمها، وتشعبت مذاهبها، واستهانت بفرائض الله عز وجل، وخفت ((1)) إلى محارم الله تعالى، فطال بعضها علوا، وانخفض بعضها تقصيرا، وشكوا جميعا إلا القليل في إمام زمانهم، وولي أمرهم، وحجة ربهم التي اختارها بعلمه، كما قال جل وعز: (وربك يخلق ما يشاء ويختار ما كان لهم الخيرة) ((2)) من أمرهم للمحنة الواقعة بهذه الغيبة التي سبق من رسول الله (صلى الله عليه وآله) ذكرها، وتقدم من أمير المؤمنين (عليه السلام) خبرها، ونطق في المأثور من خطبه والمروي عنه من كلامه وحديثه، بالتحذير من فتنتها، وحمل أهل العلم والرواية عن الأئمة من ولده (عليهم السلام) واحدا بعد واحد أخبارها حتى ما منهم أحد إلا وقدم القول فيها، وحقق كونها، ووصف امتحان الله تبارك وتعالى اسمه خلقه بها بما أوجبته قبائح الأفعال ومساوئ الأعمال، والشح المطاع، والعاجل الفاني المؤثر على الدائم الباقي، والشهوات المتبعة، والحقوق المضيعة التي اكتسبت سخط الله عز وتقدس، فلم يزل الشك والارتياب قادحين في قلوبهم - كما قال أمير المؤمنين (عليه السلام) في كلامه لكميل بن زياد في صفة طالبي العلم وحملته: "" أو منقادا لأهل الحق لا بصيرة له، ينقدح الشك في قلبه ((3)) لأول عارض من شبهة - حتى أداهم ذلك إلى التيه والحيرة والعمى والضلالة، ولم يبق منهم إلا القليل النزر الذين ثبتوا على دين الله، وتمسكوا بحبل الله، ولم يحيدوا عن صراط الله المستقيم ""، وتحقق فيهم وصف الفرقة الثابتة على الحق التي لا تزعزعها الرياح، ولا يضرها الفتن، ولا يغرها لمع السراب، ولم تدخل في دين الله بالرجال فتخرج منه بهم. كما روينا عن أبي عبد الله جعفر بن محمد (عليهما السلام) أنه قال: من دخل في هذا الدين بالرجال أخرجه منه الرجال كما أدخلوه فيه، ومن دخل فيه بالكتاب والسنة زالت الجبال قبل أن يزول ((1)). ولعمري ما أتي من تاه وتحير وافتتن وانتقل عن الحق وتعلق بمذاهب أهل الزخرف والباطل إلا من قلة الرواية والعلم وعدم الدراية والفهم، فإنهم الأشقياء، لم يهتموا بطلب العلم ولم يتعبوا أنفسهم في اقتنائه وروايته من معادنه الصافية على أنهم لو رووا ثم لم يدروا لكانوا بمنزلة من لم يرووا. وقد قال جعفر بن محمد الصادق (عليه السلام): اعرفوا منازل شيعتنا عندنا على قدر روايتهم عنا وفهمهم منا ((2)). فإن الرواية تحتاج إلى الدراية، وخبر تدريه خير من ألف خبر ترويه. وأكثر من دخل في هذه المذاهب إنما دخل على أحوال: فمنهم من دخله بغير روية ولا علم، فلما اعترضه يسير الشبهة تاه. ومنهم من أراده طلبا للدنيا وحطامها، فلما أماله الغواة والدنيويون إليها مال مؤثرا لها على الدين، مغترا مع ذلك بزخرف القول غرورا من الشياطين الذين وصفهم الله عز وجل في كتابه، فقال: (شياطين الإنس والجن يوحي بعضهم إلى بعض زخرف القول غرورا) ((3)). والمغتر به فهو كصاحب السراب الذي يحسبه الظمآن ماء يلمعه عند ظمئه لمعة ماء، فإذا جاءه لم يجده شيئا، كما قال عز وجل ((4)). ومنهم من تحلى بهذا الأمر للرياء والتحسن بظاهره، وطلبا للرئاسة، وشهوة لها وشغفا بها من غير اعتقاد للحق، ولا إخلاص فيه، فسلب الله جماله وغير حاله، وأعد له نكاله. ومنهم من دان به على ضعف من إيمانه، ووهن من نفسه بصحة ما نطق به منه، فلما وقعت هذه المحنة التي آذننا أولياء الله صلى الله عليهم بها مذ ثلاثمائة سنة تحير ووقف، كما قال الله عز وجل من قائل: (كمثل الذي استوقد نارا فلما أضاءت ما حوله ذهب الله بنورهم وتركهم في ظلمات لا يبصرون) ((1))، وكما قال: (كلما أضاء لهم مشوا فيه وإذا أظلم عليهم قاموا) ((2))، ووجدنا الرواية قد أتت عن الصادقين (عليهم السلام) بما أمروا به من وهب الله عز وجل له حظا من العلم، وأوصله منه إلى ما لم يوصل إليه غيره من تبيين ما اشتبه على إخوانهم في الدين، وإرشادهم في الحيرة إلى سواء السبيل، وإخراجهم عن منزلة الشك إلى نور اليقين. فقصدت القربة إلى الله عز وجل بذكر ما جاء عن الأئمة الصادقين الطاهرين (عليهم السلام) من لدن أمير المؤمنين (عليه السلام) إلى آخر من روي عنه منهم في هذه الغيبة التي عمي عن حقيقتها ونورها من أبعده الله عن العلم بها، والهداية إلى ما أوتي عنهم (عليهم السلام) فيها ما يصحح لأهل الحق حقيقة ما رووه ودانوا به وتؤكد حجتهم بوقوعها، ويصدق ما آذنوا به منها. وإذا تأمل من وهب الله تعالى له حسن الصورة، وفتح مسامع قلبه، ومنحه جودة القريحة، وأتحفه بالفهم وصحة الرواية بما جاء عن الهداة الطاهرين صلوات الله عليهم على قديم الأيام وحديثها من الروايات المتصلة فيها، الموجبة لحدوثها، المقتضية لكونها مما قد أوردناه في هذا الكتاب حديثا حديثا، وروي فيه، وفكر فكرا ممعنا ((1))، ولم يجعل قراءته ونظره فيه صفحا دون شافي التأمل ولم يطمح ببصره عن حديث منها يشبه ما تقدمه دون إمعان النظر فيه والتبيين له، ولما يحوي من زيادة المعاني بلفظة من كلام الإمام (عليه السلام) بحسب ما حمله واحد من الرواة عنه علم أن هذه الغيبة لو لم تكن ولم تحدث مع ذلك ومع ما روي على مر الدهور فيها لكان مذهب الإمامة باطلا، لكن الله تبارك وتعالى صدق إنذار الأئمة (عليهم السلام) بها، وصحح قولهم فيها في عصر بعد عصر، وألزم الشيعة التسليم والتصديق والتمسك بما هم عليه، وقوي اليقين في قلوبهم بصحة ما نقلوه، وقد حذر أولياء الله صلوات الله عليهم شيعتهم من أن تميل بهم الأهواء، أو تزيغ بهم وبقلوبهم الفتن واللأواء في أيامها، ووصفوا ما يشمل الله خلقه به من الابتلاء عند وقوعها بتراخي مدتها، وطول الأمد فيها (ليهلك من هلك عن بينة ويحيى من حي عن بينة) ((2)). فإنه روي عنهم (عليهم السلام) ما حدثنا به محمد بن همام، قال: حدثنا حميد بن زياد الكوفي، قال: حدثنا الحسن بن محمد بن سماعة، قال: حدثنا أحمد بن الحسن الميثمي، عن رجل من أصحاب أبي عبد الله جعفر بن محمد (عليهما السلام) أنه قال: سمعته يقول: نزلت هذه الآية التي في سورة الحديد (ولا يكونوا كالذين أوتوا الكتاب من قبل فطال عليهم الأمد فقست قلوبهم وكثير منهم فاسقون) ((3)) في أهل زمان الغيبة، ثم قال عز وجل: (أن الله يحيي الأرض بعد موتها قد بينا لكم الآيات لعلكم تعقلون) ((4)) وقال: إنما الأمد أمد الغيبة، فإنه أراد عز وجل: يا أمة محمد، أو يا معشر الشيعة، لا تكونوا كالذين أوتوا الكتاب من قبل فطال عليهم الأمد، فتأويل هذه الآية جاء في أهل زمان الغيبة وأيامها دون غيرهم من أهل الأزمنة، وإن الله تعالى نهى الشيعة عن الشك في حجة الله تعالى، أو أن يظنوا أن الله تعالى يخلي أرضه منها طرفة عين، كما قال أمير المؤمنين (عليه السلام) في كلامه لكميل بن زياد: بلى اللهم لا تخلو الأرض من حجة لله إما ظاهر معلوم، أو ((1)) خائف مغمور، لئلا تبطل حجج الله وبيناته، وحذرهم من أن يشكوا أو يرتابوا فيطول عليهم الأمد فتقسوا قلوبهم. ثم قال (عليه السلام): ألا تسمع قوله تعالى في الآية التالية لهذه الآية: (اعلموا أن الله يحيي الأرض بعد موتها قد بينا لكم الآيات لعلكم تعقلون) أي يحييها الله بعدل القائم عند ظهوره بعد موتها بجور أئمة الضلال ((2)). وتأويل كل آية منها مصدق للآخر وعلى أن قولهم صلوات الله عليهم لا بد أن يصح في شذوذ من يشذ، وفتنة من يفتتن، ونكوص من ينكص على عقبيه من الشيعة بالبلبلة ((3)) والتمحيص والغربلة التي قد أوردنا ما ذكروه (عليهم السلام) منه بأسانيد في باب ما يلحق الشيعة من التمحيص والتفرق والفتنة، إلا أنا نذكر في هذا الموضع حديثا أو حديثين من جملة ما أوردنا في ذلك الباب لئلا ينكر منكر ما حدث من هذه الفرق العاملة بالأهواء، المؤثرة للدنيا. وهو ما أخبرنا به أحمد بن محمد بن سعيد بن عقدة الكوفي، - وهذا الرجل ممن لا يطعن عليه في الثقة ولا في العلم بالحديث والرجال الناقلين له -: قال: حدثنا علي بن الحسن التيملي من تيم الله، قال: حدثني أخواي أحمد ومحمد ابنا الحسن بن علي بن فضال، عن أبيهما، عن ثعلبة بن ميمون، عن أبي كهمس، عن عمران بن ميثم، عن مالك بن ضمرة، قال: قال أمير المؤمنين (عليه السلام) لشيعته: كونوا في الناس كالنحل في الطير، ليس شئ من الطير إلا وهو يستضعفها، ولو يعلم ما في أجوافها لم يفعل بها كما يفعل، خالطوا الناس بأبدانكم، وزايلوهم بقلوبكم وأعمالكم، فإن لكل امرئ ما اكتسب وهو يوم القيامة مع من أحب، أما إنكم لن تروا ما تحبون وما تأملون - يا معشر الشيعة - حتى يتفل بعضكم في وجوه بعض، وحتى يسمي بعضكم بعضا كذابين، وحتى لا يبقى منكم على هذا الأمر إلا كالكحل في العين، أو كالملح في الطعام، وهو أقل الزاد ((1)). وسأضرب لكم في ذلك مثلا: وهو كمثل رجل كان له طعام قد ذراه وغربله ونقاه وجعله في بيت وأغلق عليه الباب ما شاء الله، ثم فتح الباب عنه فإذا السوس قد وقع فيه، ثم أخرجه ونقاه وذراه، ثم جعله في البيت وأغلق عليه الباب ما شاء الله، ثم فتح الباب عنه فإذا السوس قد وقع فيه، وأخرجه ونقاه وذراه، ثم جعله في البيت وأغلق عليه الباب، ثم أخرجه بعد حين فوجده قد وقع فيه السوس، ففعل به كما فعل مرارا حتى بقيت منه رزمة كرزمة الأندر ((2)) الذي لا يضره السوس شيئا، وكذلك أنتم تمحصكم الفتن حتى لا يبقى إلا عصابة لا تضرها الفتن شيئا ((3)). وروي عن أبي عبد الله (عليه السلام) أنه قال: والله لتمحصن والله لتطيرن يمينا وشمالا حتى لا يبقى منكم إلا كل امرئ أخذ الله ميثاقه، وكتب الإيمان في قلبه وأيده بروح منه. وفي رواية أخرى، عنهم (عليهم السلام): حتى لا يبقى منكم على هذا الأمر إلا الأندر فالأندر ((1)). وهذه العصابة التي تبقى على هذا الأمر وتثبت وتقيم على الحق هي التي أمرت بالصبر في حال الغيبة. فمن ذلك، ما أخبرنا به علي بن أحمد البندنيجي، عن عبيد الله بن موسى العلوي العباسي، عن هارون بن مسلم، عن القاسم بن عروة، عن بريد بن معاوية العجلي، عن أبي جعفر محمد بن علي الباقر (عليه السلام) في معنى قوله تعالى: (يا أيها الذين آمنوا اصبروا وصابروا ورابطوا واتقوا الله لعلكم تفلحون) ((2)) قال: اصبروا على أداء الفرائض، وصابروا عدوكم، ورابطوا إمامكم المنتظر ((3)). وهذه العصابة القليلة هي التي قال أمير المؤمنين (عليه السلام) لها: لا تستوحشوا في طريق الهدى لقلة من يسلكه ((4)) فيما أخبرنا أبو العباس أحمد بن محمد بن سعيد بن عقدة الكوفي، قال: حدثنا أبو عبد الله جعفر بن عبد الله المحمدي من كتابه في المحرم سنة ثمان وستين ومائتين، قال: حدثني يزيد بن إسحاق الأرحبي - ويعرف بشعر -، قال: حدثنا مخول، عن فرات بن أحنف، عن الأصبغ بن نباتة، قال: سمعت أمير المؤمنين (عليه السلام) على منبر الكوفة يقول: أيها الناس، أنا أنف الإيمان، أنا أنف الهدى وعيناه. أيها الناس، لا تستوحشوا في طريق الهدى لقلة من يسلكه إن الناس اجتمعوا على مائدة قليل شبعها، كثير جوعها، والله المستعان، وإنما يجمع الناس الرضا والغضب. أيها الناس، إنما عقر ناقة صالح واحد فأصابهم الله بعذابه بالرضا لفعله، وآية ذلك قوله عز وجل: (فنادوا صاحبهم فتعاطى فعقر * فكيف كان عذابي ونذر) ((1))، وقال: (فعقروها فدمدم عليهم ربهم بذنبهم فسواها * ولا يخاف عقباها) ((2)) ألا ومن سئل عن قاتلي فزعم أنه مؤمن فقد قتلني. أيها الناس، من سلك الطريق ورد الماء، ومن حاد عنه وقع في التيه، ثم نزل. ورواه لنا محمد بن همام ومحمد بن الحسن بن محمد بن جمهور، جميعا، عن الحسن بن محمد بن جمهور، عن أحمد بن نوح، عن ابن عليم، عن رجل، عن فرات ابن أحنف، قال: أخبرني من سمع أمير المؤمنين (عليه السلام)، وذكر مثله، إلا أنه قال: لا تستوحشوا في طريق الهدى لقلة أهله ((3)). وفي قول أمير المؤمنين (عليه السلام): "" من سلك الطريق ورد الماء، ومن حاد عنه وقع في التيه "" ((4))، بيان شاف لمن تأمله، ودليل على التمسك بنظام الأئمة، وتحذير من الوقوع في التيه بالعدول عنها والانقطاع عن سبيلها، ومن الشذوذ يمينا وشمالا، والإصغاء إلى ما يزخرفه المفترون المفتونون في دينهم من القول الذي هو كالهباء المنثور وكالسراب المضمحل، كما قال الله عز وجل: (ألم * أحسب الناس أن يتركوا أن يقولوا آمنا وهم لا يفتنون * ولقد فتنا الذين من قبلهم فليعلمن الله الذين صدقوا وليعلمن الكاذبين) ((1)). وكما روي عن النبي (صلى الله عليه وآله) أنه قال: إياكم وجدال كل مفتون فإنه ملقن حجته ((2)) إلى انقضاء مدته، فإذا انقضت مدته ألهبته خطيئته وأحرقته ((3)). أخبرنا بذلك عبد الواحد بن عبد الله بن يونس، قال: حدثنا محمد بن جعفر القرشي، قال: حدثني محمد بن الحسين بن أبي الخطاب، قال: حدثنا محمد بن سنان، عن أبي محمد الغفاري ((4))، عن أبي عبد الله، عن آبائه (عليهم السلام)، قال: قال رسول الله (صلى الله عليه وآله)، وذكر الحديث ((5)). وقد جمعت في هذا الكتاب ما وفق الله لجمعه من الأحاديث التي رواها الشيوخ عن أمير المؤمنين والأئمة الصادقين عليهم السلام أجمعين في الغيبة وغيرها مما سبيله أن يضاف إلى ما روي فيها بحسب ما حضر في الوقت، إذ لم يحضرني جميع ما رويته في ذلك لبعده عني وأن حفظي لم يشمل عليه، والذي رواه الناس من ذلك أكثر وأعظم مما رويته ويصغر ويقل عنه ما عندي وجعلته أبوابا صدرتها بذكر ما روي في صون سر آل محمد (عليهم السلام) عمن ليس من أهله، والتأدب بآداب أولياء الله في ستر ما أمروا بستره عن أعداء الدين والنصاب والمخالفين وسائر الفرق من المبتدعين والشاكين والمعتزلة الدافعين لفضل أمير المؤمنين صلوات الله عليه وآله أجمعين المجيزين تقديم المأموم على الإمام، والناقص على التام، خلافا على الله عز وجل حيث يقول: (أفمن يهدي إلى الحق أحق أن يتبع أم من لا يهدي إلا أن يهدى فما لكم كيف تحكمون) ((1)) وإعجابا بآرائهم المضلة وقلوبهم العمية، كما قال الله جل من قائل: (فإنها لا تعمى الأبصار ولكن تعمى القلوب التي في الصدور) ((2))، وكما قال تبارك وتعالى: (قل هل ننبئكم بالأخسرين أعمالا * الذين ضل سعيهم في الحياة الدنيا وهم يحسبون أنهم يحسنون صنعا) ((3)) الجاحدين فضل الأئمة الطاهرين وإمامتهم (عليهم السلام) المحلول في صدورهم لشقائهم ما قد تمكن فيها من العناد لهم بعد وجوب الحجة عليهم من الله بقوله عز وجل: (واعتصموا بحبل الله جميعا ولا تفرقوا) ((4)) ومن رسوله (صلى الله عليه وآله) بقوله في عترته: إنهم الهداة وسفينة النجاة، وإنهم أحد الثقلين اللذين أعلمنا تخليفه إياهما علينا والتمسك بهما بقوله: إني مخلف فيكم الثقلين: كتاب الله، وعترتي أهل بيتي حبل ممدود بينكم وبين الله، طرف بيد الله، وطرف بأيديكم، ما إن تمسكتم به لن تضلوا. خذلانا من الله شملهم به استخفافهم ذلك وبما كسبت أيديهم، وبإيثارهم العمى على الهدى، كما قال الله عز وجل: (وأما ثمود فهديناهم فاستحبوا العمى على الهدى) ((5))، وكما قال: (أفرأيت من اتخذ إلهه هواه وأضله الله على علم) ((6)) يريد عز وجل على علم لعناده للحق، واسترخائه إياه، ورده له، واستمرائه الباطل، وحلوله في قلبه وقبوله له، والله لا يظلم الناس شيئا ولكن الناس أنفسهم يظلمون ((7)). وهم المعاندون لشيعة الحق ومحبي أهل الصدق، والمنكرون لما رواه الثقات من المؤمنين عن أهل بيت رسول الله صلى الله عليه وعليهم، الرادون العايبون لهم بجهلهم وشقوتهم، القائلون بما رواه أعداؤهم، العاملون به، الجاعلون أئمتهم أهوائهم وعقولهم وآرائهم دون من اختاره الله بعلمه، حيث يقول: (ولقد اخترناهم على علم على العالمين) ((1))، ونصبه واصطفاه وانتجبه وارتضاه، المؤثرون الملح الأجاج على العذب النمير الفرات، فإن صون دين الله وطي علم خيرة الله سبحانه عن أعدائهم المستهزئين به أولى ما قدم، وأمرهم بذلك أحق ما امتثل. ثم ابتدأنا بعد ذلك بذكر حبل الله الذي أمرنا بالاعتصام به وترك التفرق عنه بقوله: (واعتصموا بحبل الله جميعا ولا تفرقوا) ((2)). وما روي في ذلك وأردفناه بذكر ما روي في الإمامة وأنها من الله عز وجل وباختياره، كما قال تبارك وتعالى: (وربك يخلق ما يشاء ويختار ما كان لهم الخيرة) ((3)) من أمرهم، وأنها عهد من الله وأمانة يؤديها الإمام إلى الذي بعده. ثم ما روي في أن الأئمة (عليهم السلام) اثنا عشر إماما وذكر ما يدل عليه من القرآن والتوراة والإنجيل من ذلك، بعد نقل ما روي من طريق العامة في ذكر الأئمة الاثني عشر. ثم ما روي فيمن ادعى الإمامة، ومن زعم أنه إمام وليس ((4)) بإمام، وأن كل راية ترفع قبل قيام القائم فصاحبها طاغوت. ثم الحديث المروي من طرق العامة. ثم ما روي فيمن شك في واحد من الأئمة صلى الله عليهم، أو بات ليلة لا يعرف فيها إمامه، أو دان الله بغير إمام منه. ثم ما روي في أن الله لا يخلي أرضه من حجة. ثم ما روي في أنه لو لم يبق في الأرض إلا اثنان لكان أحدهما الحجة. ثم ما روي في غيبة الإمام (عليه السلام)، وذكر أمير المؤمنين والأئمة صلوات الله عليهم أجمعين بعده لها، وإنذارهم بها. ثم ما روي في ما أمر به الشيعة من الصبر والكف والانتظار في حال الغيبة. ثم ما روي فيما يلحق الشيعة من التمحيص والتفرق والتشتت عند الغيبة حتى لا يبقى على حقيقة الأمر إلا الأقل. ثم ما روي في الشدة التي تكون قبل قيام القائم (عليه السلام). ثم ما روي في صفته (عليه السلام) وسيرته. ثم ما نزل من القرآن فيه (عليه السلام). ثم ما روي من العلامات التي تكون قبل ظهوره تدل على قيامه وقرب أمره. ثم ما جاء من المنع في التوقيت والتسمية لصاحب الأمر (عليه السلام). ثم ما جاء في ما يلقى القائم منذ قيامه (عليه السلام) فيبتلى من جاهلية الناس. ثم ما جاء في ذكر جيش الغضب وهم أصحاب القائم (عليه السلام) وعدتهم. ثم ما جاء في ذكر السفياني، وأن أمره من المحتوم الكائن قبل قيام القائم (عليه السلام). ثم ما جاء في ذكر راية رسول الله (صلى الله عليه وآله)، وأنه لا ينشرها بعد يوم الجمل إلا القائم (عليه السلام)، وصفتها. ثم ما جاء في ذكر أحوال الشيعة عند خروج القائم (عليه السلام) وقبله وبعده. ثم ما روي في أن القائم (عليه السلام) يستأنف دعاء جديدا، وأن الإسلام بدأ غريبا وسيعود غريبا كما بدأ. ثم ما روي في مدة ملك القائم (عليه السلام) بعد ظهوره. ثم ما روي في ذكر إسماعيل بن أبي عبد الله (عليه السلام)، وبطلان ما يدعيه المبطلون الذين هم عن السمع والعلم معزولون. ثم ما روي في أن من عرف إمامه لم يضره تقدم هذا الأمر أم تأخر. ونحن نسأل الله بوجهه الكريم وشأنه العظيم أن يصلي على الصفوة المنتجبة ((1)) من خلقه، والخيرة من بريته، وحبله المتين، وعروته الوثقى التي لا انفصام لها، محمد وآله الطاهرين، وأن يثبتنا بالقول الثابت في الحياة الدنيا وفي الآخرة، وأن يجعل محيانا ومماتنا وبعثنا على ما أنعم به علينا من دين الحق وموالاة أهله الذين خصهم بكرامته، وجعلهم السفراء بينه وبين خلقه، والحجة على بريته، وأن يوفقنا للتسليم لهم والعمل بما أمروا به، والانتهاء عما نهوا عنه، ولا يجعلنا من الشاكين في شئ من قولهم، ولا المرتابين بصدقهم، وأن يجعلنا من أنصار دينه مع وليه، والصادقين في جهاد عدوه حتى يجعلنا بذلك معهم، ويكرمنا بمجاورتهم في جنات النعيم، ولا يفرق بيننا وبينهم طرفة عين أبدا، ولا أقل من ذلك ولا أكثر، إنه جواد كريم.","Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds, Who guides whomsoever He wills to the right path, Who deserves gratefulness from His people in return for deriving them out of nonexistence into existence, forming them into the best of images, granting them with innumerable blessings apparent and hidden as he has said: وَآتَاكُمْ مِنْ كُلِّ مَا سَأَلْتُمُوهُ ۚ وَإِنْ تَعُدُّوا نِعْمَتَ اللَّهِ لَا تُحْصُوهَا ۗ إِنَّ الْإِنْسَانَ لَظَلُومٌ كَفَّارٌ “And if you count Allah's favors, you will not be able to number them.”1 He has guided them to know His Divinity and to acknowledge His Oneness with pure minds, excellent wisdom, perfect creation, pure nature, good tincture, marvelous signs and clear proofs. Then He sent for them the best of His people as prophets supported with the Holy Spirit armed with evidences; preaching, warning, guiding, reminding, informing with knowledge, defeating the oppressors with the divine signs and astonishing the intelligent with miracles. He preferred them to the rest of His people with the high excellences He granted them with, let them know His unseen and gifted them with some of His power as He said: عَالِمُ الْغَيْبِ فَلَا يُظْهِرُ عَلَىٰ غَيْبِهِ أَحَدًا إِلَّا مَنِ ارْتَضَىٰ مِنْ رَسُولٍ فَإِنَّهُ يَسْلُكُ مِنْ بَيْنِ يَدَيْهِ وَمِنْ خَلْفِهِ رَصَدًا “The Knower of the unseen! so He does not reveal His secrets to any except to him whom He chooses as a messenger; for surely He makes a guard to march before him and after him.”2 To glorify them and to raise their positions highly so that people would have no excuse before Allah after sending His messengers and that the proofs of Allah would be perfect before His people. Praise be to Allah when He bestowed upon us His sending Muhammad; the last of His messengers, the most beloved one to Him, the most glorious prophet near Him and the closest one to him. He gifted him with all what He had gifted the other prophets and added to him doubles than what He had given them. He put him in the high position to prefer him to the all. He made him imam for them when he led them in offering the prayer in the Heaven. He made him the most honorable among the all and granted him alone with intercession from among the all. He raised him to the highest Heaven until He talked with him near His Throne when he passed the positions of the close angels and the standings of the Archangels. He revealed to him a Book surpassing all the previous Books and including all the knowledge they had as He said: وَيَوْمَ نَبْعَثُ فِي كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ شَهِيدًا عَلَيْهِمْ مِنْ أَنْفُسِهِمْ ۖ وَجِئْنَا بِكَ شَهِيدًا عَلَىٰ هَٰؤُلَاءِ ۚ وَنَزَّلْنَا عَلَيْكَ الْكِتَابَ تِبْيَانًا لِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ وَهُدًى وَرَحْمَةً وَبُشْرَىٰ لِلْمُسْلِمِينَ “We have revealed the Book to you explaining clearly everything.”3 He did not neglect a bit. Allah the Almighty has guided us by Muhammad from deviation and obscurity and saved us from ignorance and perishment. He has sufficed us with Muhammad , the holy Book and the perfect religion and guided us to the guardianship of the pure guiding imams to be safe from personal opinions and interpretations (due to fancies) and He has guided us by Muhammad and the imams of his progeny to the right path. Blessing and peace be upon Muhammad and his brother Amirul Mo’mineen4 (Imam Ali), his next in virtue, his supporter in distresses and ordeals, the sword of Allah against the unbelievers and His open hand with beneficence and justice. It was Ali, who followed his brother’s path in any case, who turned with the truth wherever it turned, the keeper of his brother’s (Muhammad’s) knowledge, the depositee of his secrets. Blessing and peace be upon the pure imams; the means of mercy, the object of blessing, the full moons in darkness, the light for people, the oceans of knowledge and the gate of peace, which Allah had asked His people to enter from and warned them not to deviate from when He said: يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا ادْخُلُوا فِي السِّلْمِ كَافَّةً وَلَا تَتَّبِعُوا خُطُوَاتِ الشَّيْطَانِ ۚ إِنَّهُ لَكُمْ عَدُوٌّ مُبِينٌ “O you who believe! Enter into submission one and all and do not follow the footsteps of Shaitan; surely he is your open enemy.”5 Then: We found that some of the groups ascribed to Shiism, who believed in the imamate, which Allah had made as mercy of His right religion, adopted different opinions and ramified thoughts, became indifferent to the obligations of Allah, hastened towards the prohibitions and they all, except a few, doubted the imam of their time, the guardian of their affairs and the proof, which Allah had chosen according to His exalted knowledge as he said: وَرَبُّكَ يَخْلُقُ مَا يَشَاءُ وَيَخْتَارُ ۗ مَا كَانَ لَهُمُ الْخِيَرَةُ ۚ سُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ وَتَعَالَىٰ عَمَّا يُشْرِكُونَ “Thy Lord does create and choose as He pleases: no choice have they (in the matter)”6 …the matter of their ordeal during the absence of the expected Imam, of which the Prophet (S) had informed and Imam Ali had mentioned and warned of its sedition in his traditions and speeches. The scholars narrated from the infallible imams, one after the other, the traditions talking about this matter and confirming it and that Allah would try His people by it. The doubt about it was still inside their hearts as Imam Ali showed in his saying to Kumayl bin Ziyad: … أو مُنقاداً لأهلِ الحَقّ لا بَصيرَةَ لهُ، يَنقَدحُ الشَّكُّ في قَلبِه لأوَّلِ عارِضٍ من شُبهَةٍ – حتىّ أدّاهُم ذلكَ إلى التّيهِ وَالحَيرَةِ والعَمى وَالضّلالَةِ، وَلم يَبقَ مِنهُم إلاّ القَليلُ النُّزرُ الّذين ثَبتوا عَلى دِين اللهِ، وتَمسّكوا بحَبلِ الله، ولم يحِيدوا عَن صِراطِ الله المُستَقيم. “…or is led towards the people of truth unthinkingly, doubt comes into his heart since the first suspicion he faces, and that leads them to stray, confusion, obscurity and deviation. None of them will remain (on the right path) except a very few, who maintains on the religion of Allah, holds fast by the (rope) of Allah and do not deviate from the right path of Allah…” This few was the group that would keep to the truth, that would not be shaken by wind, nor be affected by seditions, nor be cheated by the shine of mirage and would not have come into the religion of Allah imitating some people so that they would give up when those people gave up! Imam Abu Abdullah Ja’far bin Muhammad as-Sadiq7 said: مَن دَخلَ في هذا الدّينِ بالرّجال أخْرجَهُ مِنه الرّجالُ كما أدخَلوهُ فِيه. وَمَن دخَل فِيه بالكِتابِ وَالسُّنّةِ زالَت الجِبالُ قَبلَ أنْ يَزولَ. “He, who comes into this religion imitating the men, will be taken out from it by those men, who has taken him in, and he, who comes to it by the Book and the Sunna, mountains vanish before he gives up (his religion).”8 By Allah, no one goes astray, becomes confused, is seduced and deviates from the truth to cling to one of the deviant sects except if he does not pay any attention to knowledge, research and analysis. These people are the wretched, who never care for knowledge nor attempt to get it from its pure sources and if they narrate some of that knowledge without perceiving it, they will be as those, who do not narrate. Imam Ja’far bin Muhammad as-Sadiq said: إعرِفوا مَنازلَ شِيعتِنا عندَنا عَلى قَدرِ رِوايَتِهم عنّا وفَهْمِهِم مِنّا. “You know the positions of our followers near us according to the traditions they narrate from us and according to what extent they perceive from us.”9 Narrating a tradition requires perceiving it. One tradition you perceive is better than a thousand you narrate (without perceiving). Most of those, who joined the different sects, were as the following: Some joined them without thinking or being aware and when they faced a bit of doubt they went astray. Some looked forward to this worldly life and its transient pleasures. When they were seduced by the seducers and the worldly-minded people, they gave up their faith and followed the deception of the devils, whom Allah had described in his Book when saying: وَكَذَٰلِكَ جَعَلْنَا لِكُلِّ نَبِيٍّ عَدُوًّا شَيَاطِينَ الْإِنْسِ وَالْجِنِّ يُوحِي بَعْضُهُمْ إِلَىٰ بَعْضٍ زُخْرُفَ الْقَوْلِ غُرُورًا ۚ وَلَوْ شَاءَ رَبُّكَ مَا فَعَلُوهُ ۖ فَذَرْهُمْ وَمَا يَفْتَرُونَ “…the Shaitans from among men and jinn, some of them suggesting to others varnished falsehood to deceive (them).”10 He, who is deceived by the Satan, is like (those who disbelieve, their deeds are like the mirage in a desert, which the thirsty man deems to be water; until when he comes to it he finds it to be naught).11 Some adopted this matter hypocritically looking forward to authority without believing in the truth nor being loyal to it and then Allah deprived them of their ease, changed their conditions and promised to reward them (on the Day of Resurrection) with the worst of punishment. Some adopted it with weak faith and weak soul, so when the try (the disappearance of Imam al-Mahdi), of which the infallible imams had informed some hundreds of years ago, occurred, they became confused and did not know what to do. Allah said: مَثَلُهُمْ كَمَثَلِ الَّذِي اسْتَوْقَدَ نَارًا فَلَمَّا أَضَاءَتْ مَا حَوْلَهُ ذَهَبَ اللَّهُ بِنُورِهِمْ وَتَرَكَهُمْ فِي ظُلُمَاتٍ لَا يُبْصِرُونَ “Their parable is like the parable of one who kindled a fire but when it had illumined all around him, Allah took away their light, and left them in utter darkness-- they do not see.”12 And He said: يَكَادُ الْبَرْقُ يَخْطَفُ أَبْصَارَهُمْ ۖ كُلَّمَا أَضَاءَ لَهُمْ مَشَوْا فِيهِ وَإِذَا أَظْلَمَ عَلَيْهِمْ قَامُوا ۚ وَلَوْ شَاءَ اللَّهُ لَذَهَبَ بِسَمْعِهِمْ وَأَبْصَارِهِمْ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ “Whenever it shines on them they walk in it, and when it becomes dark to them they stand still.”13 We found many traditions narrated by the infallible imams talking about those, whom Allah had granted with acumen that led them to the truth, which was vague for the others, got them to the right path during that confusion and took them out of doubt to certainty. I looked forward to be close to Allah by collecting the traditions narrated by the infallible imams of the Prophet’s progeny talking about the disappearance of Imam al-Mahdi to show the truth, which had been confirmed by all of the Prophet’s progeny and which had been neglected by those, who had been deprived of knowledge and guidance. If he, whom Allah has granted with acumen, illuminated his heart, gifted with good genius and ability of distinguishing, ponders on the traditions of the imams mentioned in this book one by one and thinks deeply over them, he will be certain that Allah has confirmed the sayings of the infallible imams (about the disappearance—al-Ghayba) age after age, has bound the Shia to believe in it and to keep to it an has strengthened the certainty in their hearts about the validity of what they have narrated from their imams. The imams had warned their Shia to be affected by the fancies and to be deviated by the seditions. They had cleared for their followers that Allah would try His people with seditions when the disappearance would occur and would try them with its long period. Allah said: إِذْ أَنْتُمْ بِالْعُدْوَةِ الدُّنْيَا وَهُمْ بِالْعُدْوَةِ الْقُصْوَىٰ وَالرَّكْبُ أَسْفَلَ مِنْكُمْ ۚ وَلَوْ تَوَاعَدْتُمْ لَاخْتَلَفْتُمْ فِي الْمِيعَادِ ۙ وَلَٰكِنْ لِيَقْضِيَ اللَّهُ أَمْرًا كَانَ مَفْعُولًا لِيَهْلِكَ مَنْ هَلَكَ عَنْ بَيِّنَةٍ وَيَحْيَىٰ مَنْ حَيَّ عَنْ بَيِّنَةٍ ۗ وَإِنَّ اللَّهَ لَسَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ “…that he who would perish might perish by clear proof, and he who would live might live by clear proof.”14 Muhammad bin Hammam narrated a tradition from Hameed bin Ziyad al-Kufi from al-Hasan bin Muhammad bin Suma’a from Ahmad bin al-Hasan al-Maythami from one of Imam as-Sadiq’s companions that Imam as-Sadiq had said: نَزَلتْ هذِهِ الآيَةُ الّتي في سورَةِ الحَديدِ أَلَمْ يَأْنِ لِلَّذِينَ آمَنُوا أَنْ تَخْشَعَ قُلُوبُهُمْ لِذِكْرِ اللَّهِ وَمَا نَزَلَ مِنَ الْحَقِّ وَلَا يَكُونُوا كَالَّذِينَ أُوتُوا الْكِتَابَ مِنْ قَبْلُ فَطَالَ عَلَيْهِمُ الْأَمَدُ فَقَسَتْ قُلُوبُهُمْ ۖ وَكَثِيرٌ مِنْهُمْ فَاسِقُونَ في أهل زمان الغيبة. ثمَّ قال عزَّ وجَلَّ: اعْلَمُوا أَنَّ اللَّهَ يُحْيِي الْأَرْضَ بَعْدَ مَوْتِهَا ۚ قَدْ بَيَّنَّا لَكُمُ الْآيَاتِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ وقال: إنمّا الأمَدُ أمَدُ الغَيبَةِ. This Qur’anic verse “…and that they should not be like those who were given the Book before, but the time became prolonged to them, so their hearts hardened, and most of them are transgressors”15 has been revealed about the people of the time of al-Ghayba. Then Allah has said: “Allah gives life to the earth after its death; indeed, We have made the communications clear to you that you may understand.”16 The time is the time of al-Ghayba. Allah has meant: O nation of Muhammad, or O people of Shia, do not be like those people, who were given the Book but the time became prolonged to them! The interpretation of this verse shows that it concerns the people of the time of al-Ghayba and not the other times. Allah has prohibited the Shia from doubting His Hujjah (Imam al-Mahdi) or thinking that Allah may leave the world without a Hujjah for a while as Imam Ali has showed through his saying to Kumayl bin Ziyad: لا تخْلو الأرضُ مِن حُجَّةٍ للهِ إمّا ظاهِرٍ مَعْلومٍ أو خَائفٍ مَغمورٍ لِئَلاّ تَبطُلَ حُجَجُ اللهِ وَبيِّناتُهُ. “The earth does never remain without a Hujjah; either apparent and known or afraid and unknown lest Your proofs and signs will be invalid.” He warned the people of suspecting and doubting in order that the time would not become prolonged to them and then their hearts would become hard. Do you not see that Allah has said: اعْلَمُوا أَنَّ اللَّهَ يُحْيِي الْأَرْضَ بَعْدَ مَوْتِهَا ۚ قَدْ بَيَّنَّا لَكُمُ الْآيَاتِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ “Know that Allah gives life to the earth after its death; indeed, We have made the communications clear to you that you may understand.”17 It means that Allah gives life to the Earth with the justice of al-Hujjah (Imam al-Mahdi) after its death because of the injustice of the deviant oppressors.”18 Interpreting each verse confirms the other and the sayings of the imams are definitely true when talking about the sedition that will occur and that some of the Shia will apostatize and separate after being tried and tested through seditions and ordeals. Here we mention a tradition or two lest someone denies the existence of such different sects, which goes after fancies and pleasures of this worldly life. Ahmad bin Muhammad bin Sa’eed bin Oqda al-Kufi, who was trusted, reliable and certain about the ones he narrated from, narrated from Ali bin al-Hasan al-Taymaly from his brothers Ahmad and Muhammad from their father from Tha’laba bin Maymoon from Abu Kahmas from Imran bin Maytham from Malik bin Dhamra that Amirul Mo’mineen (Imam Ali) had said to his Shia: كُونوا في النّاسِ كالنّحلِ في الطّير؛ لَيسَ شَيءٌ مِن الطّير إلاّ وهُو يَستَضعِفُها، وَلو يَعلمُ ما في أجوافِها لم يفعَل بها كما يَفعلُ. خالِطوا النّاسَ بِأبدانِكُم وزايِلوهُم بِقلوبِكُم وأعمالِكُم، فإنَّ لِكُلّ امرئٍ ما اكتَسَب، وهُو يومَ القِيامَةِ مَع مَن أحَبَّ. أمَا إنّكُم لنْ ترَوا ما تحِبّونَ وما تأمَلونَ يا مَعشَر الشّيعةِ حَتىّ يتْفِل بَعضُكُم في وُجوهِ بَعضٍ، وحَتىّ يُسمّي بَعضُكُم بَعضاً كذّابينَ وَحَتىّ لا يَبقى مِنكُم عَلى هذا الأمْر إلاّ كالكُحلِ في العَينِ وَالمِلحِ في الطّعامِ، وهوَ أقَلُّ الزّاد. “Be among the people like the bees among the birds. All the birds deem them weak but if they know what there is in their interiors, they will not treat them so. Mix with people with your bodies and be away from them with your hearts and doings because every one (on the day of Resurrection) will be rewarded according to his doings and will be gathered with the ones, whom he loves. O people of Shia, you will not see whom you love and what you hope until you spit at the face of each other, until you call each other as liars and until no one of you will keep on this matter (the true faith in the reappearance of Imam al-Mahdi) except like the kohl in an eye or like the salt in food and what little it is!”19 I give you an example. A man had some wheat. He winnowed, sifted, purified, put it in a store and closed the door until some period. Then he opened the door. He found that some of the wheat was worm-eaten. He took out the wheat, winnowed, sifted, purified, put it in the store and closed the door. After sometime he opened the store and found that some of the wheat was worm-eaten. He took it out, winnowed, sifted, purified, put it in the store and closed the door. He repeated that many times until nothing remained from the wheat except a very little, which would not be harmed by the worms. So are you! You will be tried and tested by the seditions until a very few of you will remain, who will not be affected by the seditions.”20 It was mentioned that Imam as-Sadiq had said: وَاللهِ لَتُمَحَّصُنَّ! وَاللهِ لَتَطَيَّرُنَّ يميناً وَشمالاً حَتىّ لا يَبقى مِنكُم إلاّ كُلّ امْرِئٍ أخَذَ اللهُ مِيثاقَهُ وَكَتبَ الإيمانَ في قَلبِهِ وَأيّدهُ بِروحٍ منه. “By Allah, you will be tested. By Allah, you will be flown right and left until no one of you will remain except he, whom Allah has promised, fixed faith into his heart and assisted with a power of His.” In another tradition narrated from them (the infallible imams) it was said: …حَتىّ لا يَبقَى مِنكُم عَلى هذا الأمرِ إلاّ الأندَرُ فالأنْدَرُ. “…until no one of you will keep on this matter except the fewer and the fewest.”21 These people, who keep on the faith and cling to the truth, have been ordered to be patient during the absence of the Hujjah. Ali bin Ahmad al-Bandaneeji narrated from Obaydillah bin Musa al-Alawi al-Abbasi from Haroon bin Muslim from al-Qassim bin Orwa from Burayd bin Mo’awiya al-Ijli that Imam Muhammad al-Baqir22 had said when interpreting the Qur’anic verse: يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا اصْبِرُوا وَصَابِرُوا وَرَابِطُوا وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ “O you who believe! Be patient and excel in patience and remain steadfast, and be careful of (your duty to) Allah, that you may be successful23” إصْبِروا عَلى أداءِ الفَرائِضِ وَصابِروا عَدُوّكم وَرابِطوا إمامَكُم المُنتَظَرَ. Be patient in offering the obligations, be patient before your enemy and station yourselves in waiting for your expected imam!24 It is this few people, whom Imam Ali has addressed when saying: لا تَسْتَوحِشوا في طَريقِ الهُدى لِقِلّتِها. “Do not feel desolate in the way of guidance when there are very few people walking in it.” Abul Abbas Ahmad bin Muhammad bin Sa’eed bin Oqda al-Kufi narrated from Abu Abdullah Ja’far bin Abdullah al-Muhammadi from his book in Muharram 268AH. He said that Yazeed bin Iss’haq al-Arhabi had told them from Mukhawwal from Furat bin Ahnaf that al-Asbugh bin Nabata had said: I heard Amirul Mo’mineen from above the minbar of Kufa saying: أيّها النّاسُ! أنا أنفُ الإيمَانِ، أنا أنْفُ الهُدى وَعَيناهُ. أيّها النّاسُ! لا تَستَوحِشوا في طَريقِ الهُدى لِقِلّةِ مَن يسلُكُه. إنّ النّاسَ اجتَمعوا على مائِدةٍ قَليلٍ شَبعُها كَثيرٍ جوعُها، وَاللهُ المُستعانُ، وإنمّا يجمَعُ النّاسَ الرّضا والغضبُ. أيّها الناسُ! إنمّا عَقرَ ناقَةَ صالحٍ واحِدٌ فأصابهُمُ اللهُ بعذابِه بِالرّضا لِفعلهِ. وآيَةُ ذلِك قَولُه عزّ وَجَلّ: فَنَادَوْا صَاحِبَهُمْ فَتَعَاطَىٰ فَعَقَرَ فَكَيْفَ كَانَ عَذَابِي وَنُذُرِ فَكَذَّبُوهُ فَعَقَرُوهَا فَدَمْدَمَ عَلَيْهِمْ رَبُّهُمْ بِذَنْبِهِمْ فَسَوَّاهَا وَلَا يَخَافُ عُقْبَاهَا ألاَ وَمَن سُئِلَ عَن قاتِلmuي فزَعمَ أنّه مؤمِنٌ فقَد قَتلَني. أيّها النّاسُ! مَن سَلكَ الطّريق وَردَ الماءَ، ومَن حادَ عَنه وقَعَ في التّيه. O people, I am the nose of faith. I am the nose and the eyes of guidance. O people, do not feel desolate in the way of guidance when there are very few people walking in it. People have gathered at a table, whose satiety is little and whose hunger is much. Allah is the helper! That, which gathers people, is either contentment or anger. O people, who killed the she-camel of Prophet Salih was one person but Allah afflicted all the people with torment because they became pleased with that person’s doing. Allah said: “But they called their companion, so he took (the sword) and slew (her). How (great) was then My punishment and My warning.”25 And He said: “…and (they) slaughtered her, therefore their Lord crushed them for their sin and leveled them (with the ground) and He fears not its consequence.”26 He, who is asked about my killer and alleged that he (the killer) is faithful, (as if he) has killed me. O people, he, who walks in the (right) way, will get to the water (source) and he, who deviates from it, will get lost. Then he descended from the minbar.” The same was narrated by Muhammad bin Hammam and Muhammad bin al-Hasan bin Muhammad bin Jumhoor from Ahmad bin Noah from ibn Olaym from somebody from Furat bin Ahnaf.27 In the saying of Imam Ali “He, who walks in the (right) way, will get to the water (source) and he, who deviates from it, will get lost” there is a clear meaning and a sufficient evidence leading to keeping to the path of the infallible imams and a warning of getting lost when deviating from their path or straying left or right and listening to the raving of the fabricators, whose sayings are like scattered dust or vanishing mirage as Allah says: أَحَسِبَ النَّاسُ أَنْ يُتْرَكُوا أَنْ يَقُولُوا آمَنَّا وَهُمْ لَا يُفْتَنُونَ وَلَقَدْ فَتَنَّا الَّذِينَ مِنْ قَبْلِهِمْ ۖ فَلَيَعْلَمَنَّ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ صَدَقُوا وَلَيَعْلَمَنَّ الْكَاذِبِينَ “Do men think that they will be left alone on saying, We believe, and not be tried. And certainly We tried those before them, so Allah will certainly know those who are true and He will certainly know the liars.”28 Abdul Wahid bin Abdullah bin Younus narrated from Muhammad bin Ja’far al-Qarashi from Muhammad bin al-Husayn bin Abul Khattab from Muhammad bin Sinan from Abu Muhammad al-Ghifari from Imam as-Sadiq from his fathers that the Prophet (S) had said: إيّاكُم وجِدالَ كُلّ مَفتونٍ فإنّهُ ملقّن حُجتّهُ إلى انقِضاءِ مُدّتِه، فإذا انقَضَت مُدّتُهُ ألهَبَتهُ خَطيئَتُه وأحْرقَتهُ. “Beware of arguing with any infatuated one because he is prompted (by the Satan) to a certain period and when his period passes, his sin will burn him.”29 I have collected in this book the traditions narrated by the liable narrators from Imam Ali and the other pure imams (peace be upon them all) talking about al-Ghayba (the disappearance of Imam al-Mahdi) and other subjects. I may have not mentioned all the traditions talking about the subject and what people have of such traditions is much more than what I have mentioned in this book. I divided the book into chapters beginning with talking about keeping the secret of the Prophet’s progeny, imitating their manners and keeping secret what they had been ordered to keep secret from the enemies of the religion and from their enemies and opponents of the different sects of heretics, suspectors and Mu’tazilites,30 who denied the virtue of Imam Ali and permitted to prefer the ma’moom31 to the imam and the imperfect one to the perfect one. By doing that they opposed Allah where He said: قُلْ هَلْ مِنْ شُرَكَائِكُمْ مَنْ يَهْدِي إِلَى الْحَقِّ ۚ قُلِ اللَّهُ يَهْدِي لِلْحَقِّ ۗ أَفَمَنْ يَهْدِي إِلَى الْحَقِّ أَحَقُّ أَنْ يُتَّبَعَ أَمَّنْ لَا يَهِدِّي إِلَّا أَنْ يُهْدَىٰ ۖ فَمَا لَكُمْ كَيْفَ تَحْكُمُونَ “Is He then Who guides to the truth more worthy to be followed, or he who himself does not go aright unless he is guided? What then is the matter with you; how do you judge.”32 They were conceited of their own opinions and blind hearts as Allah said: أَفَلَمْ يَسِيرُوا فِي الْأَرْضِ فَتَكُونَ لَهُمْ قُلُوبٌ يَعْقِلُونَ بِهَا أَوْ آذَانٌ يَسْمَعُونَ بِهَا ۖ فَإِنَّهَا لَا تَعْمَى الْأَبْصَارُ وَلَٰكِنْ تَعْمَى الْقُلُوبُ الَّتِي فِي الصُّدُورِ “For surely it is not the eyes that are blind, but blind are the hearts which are in the breasts.”33 Also, He said: قُلْ هَلْ نُنَبِّئُكُمْ بِالْأَخْسَرِينَ أَعْمَالًا الَّذِينَ ضَلَّ سَعْيُهُمْ فِي الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا وَهُمْ يَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّهُمْ يُحْسِنُونَ صُنْعًا “Say: Shall We inform you of the greatest losers in (their) deeds? (These are) they whose labor is lost in this world’s life and they think that they are well versed in skill of the work of hands.”34 They denied the virtues and the imamate of the infallible imams after Allah had bound them with the clear proof when saying: وَاعْتَصِمُوا بِحَبْلِ اللَّهِ جَمِيعًا وَلَا تَفَرَّقُوا ۚ وَاذْكُرُوا نِعْمَتَ اللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ إِذْ كُنْتُمْ أَعْدَاءً فَأَلَّفَ بَيْنَ قُلُوبِكُمْ فَأَصْبَحْتُمْ بِنِعْمَتِهِ إِخْوَانًا وَكُنْتُمْ عَلَىٰ شَفَا حُفْرَةٍ مِنَ النَّارِ فَأَنْقَذَكُمْ مِنْهَا ۗ كَذَٰلِكَ يُبَيِّنُ اللَّهُ لَكُمْ آيَاتِهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَهْتَدُونَ “And hold fast by the covenant of Allah all together and be not disunited.”35 And after the Prophet (S) had confirmed that his progeny were the guides and the ship of safety and that they were one of the two weighty things he had left for us to keep to them when saying: إنيّ مُخلّفٌ فيكم الثّقَلينِ كتابَ اللهِ وعِترتي أهلَ بيتي: حَبلٌ ممدودٌ بَينَكم وبَين اللهِ، طَرفٌ بِيدِ الله وَطرفٌ بأيدِيكُم. ما إنْ تمَسّكتُم به لَن تضِلّوا. “I have left to you the two weighty things; the Book of Allah and my progeny. They are an extended rope between you and Allah. One end of it is in the hand of Allah and the other is in your hands. If you keep to them (the Qur'an and the progeny), you will never go astray at all.” But when they became indifferent and preferred blindness to guidance, Allah rewarded them with disgrace. Allah said: وَأَمَّا ثَمُودُ فَهَدَيْنَاهُمْ فَاسْتَحَبُّوا الْعَمَىٰ عَلَى الْهُدَىٰ فَأَخَذَتْهُمْ صَاعِقَةُ الْعَذَابِ الْهُونِ بِمَا كَانُوا يَكْسِبُونَ “And as to Thamood, We showed them the right way, but they chose error above guidance.”36 And He said: أَفَرَأَيْتَ مَنِ اتَّخَذَ إِلَٰهَهُ هَوَاهُ وَأَضَلَّهُ اللَّهُ عَلَىٰ عِلْمٍ وَخَتَمَ عَلَىٰ سَمْعِهِ وَقَلْبِهِ وَجَعَلَ عَلَىٰ بَصَرِهِ غِشَاوَةً فَمَنْ يَهْدِيهِ مِنْ بَعْدِ اللَّهِ ۚ أَفَلَا تَذَكَّرُونَ “Have you then considered him who takes his low desire for his god, and Allah has made him err having knowledge.”37 They opposed the truth intendedly and kept on doing wrongs and became pleased with that; therefore Allah afflicted them with torment “Surely Allah does not do any injustice to men, but men are unjust to themselves.”38 They themselves were the opponent of the true Shia, who loved the pure and truthful progeny of the Prophet (S), and they themselves denied what the reliable believers narrated from the Prophet’s progeny. They criticized the infallible Prophet’s progeny and spread their opponents’ traditions. They made their fancies, idiotic minds and deviant opinions as their imams whereas Allah had said: وَلَقَدِ اخْتَرْنَاهُمْ عَلَىٰ عِلْمٍ عَلَى الْعَالَمِينَ “And certainly We chose them, having knowledge, above the nations.”39 Then we talked about the “rope” of Allah that He ordered us to keep to and not to separate when He said: وَاعْتَصِمُوا بِحَبْلِ اللَّهِ جَمِيعًا وَلَا تَفَرَّقُوا ۚ وَاذْكُرُوا نِعْمَتَ اللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ إِذْ كُنْتُمْ أَعْدَاءً فَأَلَّفَ بَيْنَ قُلُوبِكُمْ فَأَصْبَحْتُمْ بِنِعْمَتِهِ إِخْوَانًا وَكُنْتُمْ عَلَىٰ شَفَا حُفْرَةٍ مِنَ النَّارِ فَأَنْقَذَكُمْ مِنْهَا ۗ كَذَٰلِكَ يُبَيِّنُ اللَّهُ لَكُمْ آيَاتِهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَهْتَدُونَ “And hold fast by the covenant of Allah all together and be not disunited.” And we mentioned the traditions evidencing this matter. Then we discussed the matter of imamate by mentioning the traditions confirming that it had been determined by Allah. Allah said: وَرَبُّكَ يَخْلُقُ مَا يَشَاءُ وَيَخْتَارُ ۗ مَا كَانَ لَهُمُ الْخِيَرَةُ ۚ سُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ وَتَعَالَىٰ عَمَّا يُشْرِكُونَ “And your Lord creates and chooses whom He pleases; to choose is not theirs.”40 So imamate was a covenant by Allah and a deposit that an imam was to deliver to the next imam. Then we mentioned the traditions confirming that the imams were twelve and the evidences on that were derived from the holy Qur'an, the Torah and the Bible. Then we mentioned the news talking about those, who pretended that they were imams but they were not and that every banner raised before the banner of Imam al-Mahdi (aj), would be of a tyrant. Then we specified individual chapters with various subjects concerning different sides of the matter of the Expected Imam evidenced by Qur’anic verses and true prophetic traditions. We pray Allah the Almighty to bless the best choice of His creation, the purest of His people, His perfect covenant, the firmest handle, which shall not break off; Muhammad and his pure progeny. We pray Him to assist us in keeping to the truth in this life and in the afterlife, to make our life, death and resurrection on His pure religion and on the loyalty to the choice, whom He has favored with the highest of excellences, whom He has made as mediators between Him and His people and whom He has made the argument over the humanity, to make us succeed in submitting to them by doing what they have ordered to do and refraining from what they have prohibited to do and not to make us among those, who doubt anything of their sayings or suspect their truthfulness. We pray to Allah to make us among the assistants of His religion, who fight with His guardian against His enemy in order to be with the pure choice; the Prophet and his progeny (peace be upon them), and not to separate between them and us in the twinkle of an eye, no more no less…He is the Most Generous, the Most Compassionate.We pray to Allah to make us among the assistants of His religion, who fight with His guardian against His enemy in order to be with the pure choice; the Prophet and his progeny (peace be upon them), and not to separate between them and us in the twinkle of an eye, no more no less…He is the Most Generous, the Most Compassionate.We pray to Allah to make us among the assistants of His religion, who fight with His guardian against His enemy in order to be with the pure choice; the Prophet and his progeny (peace be upon them), and not to separate between them and us in the twinkle of an eye, no more no less…He is the Most Generous, the Most Compassionate.We pray to Allah to make us among the assistants of His religion, who fight with His guardian against His enemy in order to be with the pure choice; the Prophet and his progeny (peace be upon them), and not to separate between them and us in the twinkle of an eye, no more no less…He is the Most Generous, the Most Compassionate.We pray to Allah to make us among the assistants of His religion, who fight with His guardian against His enemy in order to be with the pure choice; the Prophet and his progeny (peace be upon them), and not to separate between them and us in the twinkle of an eye, no more no less…He is the Most Generous, the Most Compassionate.We pray to Allah to make us among the assistants of His religion, who fight with His guardian against His enemy in order to be with the pure choice; the Prophet and his progeny (peace be upon them), and not to separate between them and us in the twinkle of an eye, no more no less…He is the Most Generous, the Most Compassionate."

No, by Allah, it is not so until (our companions) preserve it as Allah has preserved it, honor it as Allah has honored it and care for it deservingly as Allah has ordered.”"

He said: “A man will come to you from this gate. He will be one of the people of Paradise. He asks about what concerns him.” Then a tall man looking like the people of Mudhar came in. He advanced, greeted the Prophet (S) and sat down. He said: “O messenger of Allah, I have heard Allah saying in His Book: (And hold fast by the covenant (rope) of Allah all together and be not disunited). Then what is this “rope” that Allah has ordered us to keep to and not to separate from?” The Prophet (S) pondered long and then raised his head and pointed with his hand to Ali bin Abu Talib saying: “This is the “rope” of Allah. He, who keeps to him, will be saved in his life and will not be deviant in his afterlife.” The man jumped and embraced Imam Ali . He said: “I have kept to the rope of Allah and the rope of His messenger.” Then he left. A man from among the people got up and said: “O messenger of Allah, do I follow after him and ask him to pray Allah to forgive me?” The Prophet (S) said: “Then you find him pleased.” He followed him and asked him to pray Allah for him. He said to him: “Did you understand what the Prophet (S) said to me and what I said to him?” He said: “Yes, I did.” He said: “If you keep to that rope, then Allah will forgive you; otherwise He will not forgive you.” If the Prophet (S) had not declared for us the rope of Allah that He had ordered us in His Book to keep to and not to separate from, then the opponents would have interpreted it according to their fancies and turned it away to other than what Allah and his messenger had meant. But the Prophet (S) had said in his speech he made in the mosque of al-Khayf during the last hajj (farewell hajj): “I shall precede you (to Paradise) and you will come to me at the pond, whose width is as between Busra and San’aa. It has cups as much as the stars of the sky. I have left to you the two weighty things; the great one is the Qur’an and the minor one is my family. They both are the rope of Allah. It is extended between you and Almighty Allah. If you keep to it, you will never go astray at all. One of its ends is in the hand of Allah and the other is in your hands.” It has this addition according to another tradition: “The Most Kind has told me that they will not separate until they come to me at the pond (of Paradise) together like these two forefingers. (He gathered his two fingers).” The same was narrated by Abdul Wahid bin Abdullah bin Younus al-Moossili from Muhammad bin Ali bin Ibraheem bin Hashim from his father from his grandfather from Muhammad bin Abu Omayr from Hammad bin Eessa from Hurayz from Abu Abdullah Ja’far bin Muhammad bin Ali (as-Sadiq) from his father from his forefathers from Imam Ali . Also it was narrated by Abdul Wahid bin Abdullah from Muhammad bin Ali from his father from his grandfather from al-Hasan bin Mahboob and al-Hasan bin Ali bin Fadhdhal from Ali bin Aqaba from Abu Abdullah (Imam as-Sadiq). And the same was narrated by Abdul Wahid bin Muhammad bin Ali from his father from his grandfather from al-Hasan bin Mahboob from Ali bin Ri’ab from Abu Hamza ath-Thimali from Abu Ja’far Muhammad bin Ali al-Baqir . The holy Qur’an always has been with Ahlul Bayt and they always have been with the holy Qur’an. They both are the rope of Allah. They never separate as the Prophet (S) has told. This is an evidence for any one, whom Allah has guided to His true religion, showing that whoever resorts to other than the holy Qur’an and Ahlul Bayt, whom Allah has made the guardians after the Prophet (S) and made obeying them as one of the necessary obligations of religion, in looking for knowledge and orders of the Qur’an and all the religious affairs, definitely will go astray and perish and cause others to perish. Ahlul Bayt were those, whom the Prophet (S) had offered as the highest examples to his umma. He said: “My family to you is like the Ark of Noah. Whoever rides on it will be safe and whoever lags behind it will drown.” He also said: “The example of my family to you is like the Gate of Forgiveness of the Israelites. Whoever enters it his sins will be forgiven and will deserve mercy and blessing of Allah.” Allah has said: “…And enter the gate making obeisance, and say, forgiveness. We will forgive you your wrongs and give more to those who do good (to others).” Imam Ali said in one of his speeches: “The knowledge that Adam has brought from the Heaven to the earth and all the virtues of the prophets until the last of them, Prophet Muhammad, have been granted to Ahlul Bayt. So whereto do you go astray? Where do you go, O you, who have been derived from the people of the Ark? As some only had been saved there, here also some only will be saved. Woe to one, who opposes them (the infallible imams).” He also said: “We, to you, are like the cave to the People of the Cave and like the Gate of Forgiveness, which is the gate of peace. So be in peace all of you.” He also said through his speech: “The loyal companions of Muhammad are certain that he has said: “I and my family are infallible. Do not precede them in order not to go astray, do not lag behind them in order not to fall in mistakes, do not object to them in order not to be ignorant and do not teach them because they are much more aware than you. They are the most aware when young and the most aware when old. Follow the truth and its people wherever they are and be far away from the untruth and its people wherever they are.” But unfortunately people brushed all that aside. They considered the orders of the Prophet (S) as ridiculous and raving. They refused to follow those, whom Allah and His messengers had ordered to be obeyed. Allah said: “So, ask the followers of the reminder if you do not know.” “Obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those in authority from among you.” The Prophet (S) confirmed many times that safety was bound by keeping to Ahlul Bayt, doing according to their sayings, submitting to their orders, learning from them and walking in their path; nevertheless people resorted to others than them and ascribed their virtues to those others. They became pleased with those others and so Allah deprived them from the true knowledge. They began to interpret according to their fancies and analogies and they became satisfied with their own minds away from the guidance of Allah, His messenger and the infallible imams, whom Allah had appointed to be the guides for His people. When they brushed all that aside and depended on their own opinions, Allah left them to stray in confusion and deviation and consequently they perished and caused others to perish. Allah said: “Say: Shall We inform you of the greatest losers in (their) deeds. (These are) they whose labor is lost in this world’s life and they think that they are well versed in skill of the work of hands.” As if people had not heard the saying of Allah: “And the day when the unjust one shall bite his hands saying: O! would that I had taken a way with the Messenger. O woe is me! would that I had not taken such a one for a friend.” So was that “messenger” but Muhammad ? And who was that “one” mentioned in the verse? Immediately after that Allah said: “Certainly he led me astray from the reminder after it had come to me.” It meant after acknowledging Islam and becoming a Muslim. Then what was that “reminder” which that one’s friend had led him astray from? Was it not the holy Qur’an and Ahlul Bayt? Allah had called the Prophet (S) as “reminder” when He said: “Allah has indeed revealed to you a reminder; a messenger.” And when He said: “So, ask the followers of the reminder if you do not know.” Was the “reminder” mentioned in the verse but the Prophet (S)? And who were the “followers of the reminder” save the Prophet’s family? Then Allah said: “…And the Satan fails to aid man.” Definitely the Satan would lead his followers away from the “reminder” and then they would lose in this life and the afterlife. Allah said expressing the Prophet’s situation: “And the Messenger cried out: O my Lord! surely my people have treated this Qur’an as a forsaken thing.” They became indifferent to the Qur’an, to which and to Ahlul Bayt Allah had ordered them to keep. Did this blame not concern the people, to whom the Qur’an had been revealed? Did it not concern the people of this umma, who had wronged their Prophet’s family and left the Qur’an aside? It was they, whom the Prophet (S) would witness against on the Day of Resurrection for they had preferred the pleasures of this life to their religion out of doubting Muhammad and envying his family because Allah had favored them with great excellences. The Prophet (S) said: “On the Day of Resurrection, some of my companions will quiver right and left. I will say: O my God, they are my companions. It will be said: O Muhammad, you do not know what they have committed after you. Then I will say: Away with them! Away with them!” Allah confirmed this by saying: “And Muhammad is no more than a messenger; the messengers have already passed away before him; if then he dies or is killed will you turn back upon your heels? And whoever turns back upon his heels will by no means do harm to Allah in the least and Allah will reward the grateful.” This verse had a certain evidence that there would be some people, who would turn back on their heels after the death of the Prophet (S) and who would deny the orders of Allah and His messenger. Allah said: “…Then let those beware who withstand the Messenger’s order, lest some trial befall them, or a grievous penalty be inflicted on them.” Allah would double torment and disgrace for those, who wronged the Prophet’s family and deprived them of their rights and who changed the orders of Allah when He ordered that they (the Prophet’s family) were to be obeyed, loved and taken as guides. Allah said: “Say: No reward do I ask of you for this except the love of those near of kin.” “… Is then He Who gives guidance to truth more worthy to be followed, or he who finds not guidance (himself) unless he is guided? What then is the matter with you? How judge ye?” The true believers of the umma had agreed upon that Imam Ali was the guardian of the Prophet (S). He guided the companions to the truth often and always and none of them ever guided him. They all were in need of him but he was not in need of any of them. He knew and taught all kinds of knowledge but none of them ever taught him a bit. They did wrong to Fatima, the infallible Prophet’s daughter, to a degree that she recommended in her will to be buried secretly at night and that none of her father’s umma was to offer the prayer (prayer for the dead) for her except those few ones she had mentioned. If there was no calamity in the history of Islam bringing shame and disgrace other than the calamity of Fatima until she left to the better world angry with her father’s umma leaving her bitter will that no one was to attend her burial except very few loyal companions, it would be sufficient evidence for the ignorant and for those, whose hearts were sealed, to see what a great sin they had committed when they wronged Fatima, her husband and her sons (peace be upon them) and when they preferred the oppressors to the Prophet’s family, who were the elite of Allah. Allah said: “For surely it is not the eyes that are blind, but blind are the hearts which are in the breasts.” This blindness will cling to the enemies of the Prophet’s family until the Day of Resurrection. Allah said: “Certainly you were heedless of it, but now We have removed from you your veil, so your sight today is sharp.” “The day on which their excuse shall not benefit the unjust, and for them is curse and for them is the evil abode.” Then how odd it was when those blind and deaf people pretended that the holy Qur’an had not had all things about the obligations and the laws needed by people; therefore when they did not find all things, they used their analogies in deriving the laws and they fabricated lies and ascribed them to the Prophet (S) that he had permitted them to do according to their own derivations whereas Allah had said in His Book: “… And We have revealed the Book to you explaining clearly everything.” “We have not neglected anything in the Book.” “And We have recorded everything in a clear writing.” “And We have recorded everything in a book.” “I do not follow aught save that which is revealed to me.” “And that you should judge between them by what Allah has revealed.” One, who says that something of the affairs of this life and the afterlife, the laws of religion, the obligations and everything that people need is not available in the Qur’an, about which Allah has said, “… and We have revealed the Book to you explaining clearly everything,” refutes the saying of Allah, ascribes lying to Allah and does not believe in His Book. By Allah, they showed the reality of themselves and of the imams, whom they imitated, when they said that they had not found everything in the Qur’an because they were not among the people of the Qur’an nor among those, who had been given the knowledge of the Qur’an nor had Allah and His messenger given them a share of that because Allah had granted all the knowledge of the Qur’an to the Prophet’s family, who were the trustees, the heirs and the interpreters of the Qur’an. If they submitted to the order of Allah when saying: “…And if they had referred it to the Messenger and to those in authority among them, those among them who can search out the knowledge of it would have known it.” “So ask the followers of the reminder if you do not know.” Allah would get them to the light of guidance, would teach them what they had not known and would make them not need analogy or derivation according to their own opinions and then the differences between the laws of religion would disappear and they would not need to ascribe fabricated traditions to the Prophet (S) claiming that the Prophet (S) had permitted it (deciding according to one’s analogy) whereas the Qur’an had prohibited it when saying: “And if it were from any other than Allah, they would have found in it many a discrepancy.” “And be not like those who separated and disputed after clear arguments had come to them.” “And hold fast by the covenant (rope) of Allah all together and be not disunited.” The Qur’anic verses talking about disagreement and separation are innumerable. Disagreement and separation in religion lead to deviation. Nevertheless they permitted that and claimed that the Prophet (S) had permitted it whereas Allah had prohibited it by saying: “And be not like those who separated and disputed after clear arguments had come to them.” Is there something clearer than this? Do people have any excuse before Allah after that? We pray Allah not to let us go astray and not to let us submit to our minds and fancies in deciding the matters of our religion. We pray Him to firm our guidance and faith, to keep to His guardians, to do according to what they have ordered and to refrain from what they have prohibited in order to meet Him with our faith and loyalty. We pray Him not to let us precede His guardians nor lag behind them for he, who precedes them, will apostatize, who lags behind them will drown, who opposes them will perish and who keeps to them will succeed as the Prophet (S) has said."

Each imam is to open the seal and to do according to what there is in his covenant.” O people of Shia, this shows clearly that whomsoever Allah wishes good to, will make him among those who believe in the infallible imams , whom Allah has granted with dignity, made His choice and preferred to all of His people by making them His deputies on the earth. He has made obeying them as obeying Him when saying: “O you who believe! obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those in authority from among you.” And: “Whoever obeys the Messenger, he indeed obeys Allah.” The Prophet ﷺ has ordered the people to follow the infallible imams of his progeny, whom Allah has imposed obeying them upon all the people. The Prophet ﷺ has showed that clearly by saying: “I have left among you the two weighty things; the Book of Allah and my family. They are an extended “rope” between you and Allah. If you keep to them, you will never go astray at all.” Allah has said: “…Therefore let those beware who go against his order lest a trial afflict them or there befall them a painful chastisement.” When the Prophet ﷺ had been opposed, his sayings had been denied, his ordered had been disobeyed and when his progeny had been deprived of their inheritance and rights and had been wronged then the torment of Allah afflicted the oppressors, their followers and whoever was pleased with their deeds. Allah hastened for them the sedition in their religion. They went astray far away from the right path. They separated and became in different sects with confused opinions besides that Allah has prepared for them the bitterest of torment on the Day of Resurrection. Allah said: “So He made hypocrisy to follow as a consequence into their hearts till the day when they shall meet Him because they failed to perform towards Allah what they had promised with Him and because they told lies.” Allah has made hypocrisy as punishment for ones, who have broken their promise and He has called them as hypocrites. He said: “Surely the hypocrites are in the lowest stage of the fire and you shall not find a helper for them.” If this was the case of one, who broke his promise, that his punishment would lead him to the lowest bottom of Hell so what about those, who declared openly their disobedience to the orders of Allah and His messenger and their oppression towards those, whom Allah had ordered people to obey, to keep to and to be with when He said: “O you who believe! Be careful of (your duty to) Allah and be with the true ones.” It is they who were loyal to their covenant they made with Allah in jihad and in sacrifice for the sake of Him and supporting the Prophet ﷺ and assisting his mission where Allah said: “Of the believers are men who are true to the covenant which they made with Allah: so of them is he who accomplished his vow, and of them is he who yet waits, and they have not changed in the least.” What a great difference is between those, who are sincere to Allah, who sacrifice themselves for the sake of Allah and who strive to support the Prophet ﷺ and his mission and between those, who disobey Allah and His messenger, who wrong the family of the Prophet ﷺ and whose deeds will lead them to the lowest bottom of Hell! This is the end of every one deviating from any of the infallible imams, whom Allah has chosen to be the guides for His people. This is the end of every one denying the imamate of any of them, following else than them and claiming that the right is of else than them because the order of the will and the imamate has been determined by Allah the Almighty and not by anyone of His people; therefore he, who disobeys the order of Allah, will definitely be in the abyss of Hell where the oppressors and the hypocrites will be."

Allah orders you to marry Fatima to your brother Ali.” The Prophet (S) sent for Ali and said to him: “O Ali, I will marry my daughter Fatima, the head lady of the women of the world and the most beloved one to me, to you and there will be from you (your offspring) the two masters of the martyrs of Paradise, the oppressed bloodstained martyrs on the earth after me and the highborn progeny, with whom Allah will defeat injustice, revive the truth and finish off the untruth. Their number is like the number of the months of a year. Behind the last one of them Prophet Jesus the son of Blessed Virgin Mary will offer the prayer.”"

They came into the mosque and sat down. A handsome and neat man came, greeted Amirul Mo’mineen and sat before him. He said: “O Amirul Mo’mineen, I want to ask you three questions.” Amirul Mo’mineen said: “Ask whatever you like.” The man said: “Would you tell me if man sleeps where his soul goes to? How does man remember and forget? How do man’s children look like their uncles; their father’s brothers and mother’s brothers?” Amirul Mo’mineen turned to his son al-Hasan and said to him: “O Abu Muhammad, answer him!” Imam al-Hasan said to the man: “As for your question that when man sleeps whereto his soul goes, his soul is hanging in the air until he moves during his wake, so when Allah permits that that soul is to go back to the body, the soul attracts the air to settle in its body but if Allah does not permit that soul to get back to that body, the air will attract the soul away from the body until the Day of Resurrection. But as for what you asked about remembering and forgetting, the heart of man has been created to comply with the truth and there is a cover on the truth. If he prays Allah to have blessing upon Muhammad and his family in a perfect way, that cover will be removed from upon the truth and the heart will shine then one will remember what he has forgotten but if he does not pray Allah to have blessing upon Muhammad and his family or his prayer is imperfect, the cover will get closed on the truth and the heart will be dark and then he will forget what he has remembered. As about a newborn baby that looks like the uncles, if a man goes to bed with his wife with calm heart, tranquil nerves and undisturbed body, his sperm will settle inside the womb and the baby will looks like either its father or its mother. If a man goes to bed with his wife with upset heart, unquiet nerves and disturbed body, the sperm also will upset and fall on some veins. If it falls on a vein of the father’s brothers, the baby will look like the father’s brothers and if it falls on a vein of the mother’s brothers, the baby will look like the mother’s brothers.” The man said: “I witness that there is no god but Allah and I will keep on that. I witness that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah and I will keep on that. (He pointed to Imam Ali with his hand and said) I witness that you are the guardian of the messenger of Allah and the successor of his authority and I will keep on it. (He pointed to Imam al-Hasan and said) I witness that you are his guardian and the successor of his authority and I will keep on it. I witness that al-Husayn bin Ali is his (al-Hasan’s) guardian and the successor of his authority and I will keep on that. I witness that Ali bin al-Husayn is the guardian of al-Husayn. I witness that Muhammad bin Ali is the guardian of Ali bin al-Husayn. I witness that Ja’far is the guardian of Muhammad (bin Ali). I witness that Musa is the guardian of Ja’far. I witness that Ali (bin Musa) is the guardian of Musa. I witness that Muhammad (bin Ali bin Musa) is the guardian of Ali (bin Musa). I witness that Ali (bin Muhammad) is the guardian of Muhammad. I witness that al-Hasan is the guardian of Ali and I witness that a man from among the offspring of al-Husayn, who is not named or surnamed until he appears by the will of Allah to spread justice allover the earth after it has been filled with injustice and oppression, is the guardian of al-Hasan bin Ali. Peace, mercy and blessing of Allah be upon you, O Amirul Mo’mineen.” Then he left. Then Amirul Mo’mineen said to Imam al-Hasan: “O Abu Muhammad, follow after him and see where he goes to!” Imam al-Hasan said: “I followed after him, but since he put his leg out of the gate of the mosque I could not know where he disappeared. I came back and told Amirul Mo’mineen . He said to me: “O Abu Muhammad, do you know who he is?” I said: “No, Allah, His messenger and Amirul Mo’mineen are more aware.” He said: “He is al-Khidr .”"

Whenever you are not busy, let me be alone with you to ask you about something.” Jabir said: “Whenever you like!” One day he was alone with him. He said to him: “O Jabir, tell me about the tablet you have seen in the hand of Fatima, the Prophet’s daughter . What has my mother Fatima told you about that has been written in that tablet?” Jabir said: “I swear by Allah, Whom there is no god other than, that I had come to your mother Fatima when the Prophet (S) was alive to congratulate her for the birth of al-Husayn and I found a green tablet in her hand. I thought it was of emerald. It had a white writing like the light of the sun. I said to her: “My father and mother may be sacrificed for you! What is this tablet?” She said: “This tablet has been gifted by Allah the Almighty to His messenger . It has the names of my father, my husband, my two sons and the names of the guardians of my grandsons. My father has given it to me to make me delighted with it.” Jabir said: “Your mother Fatima gave it to me. I read it and copied it.” My father said to him: “O Jabir, would you show it to me?” Jabir replied: “Yes.” My father went with Jabir to his house. My father took out a tablet of leather and said to Jabir: “Look at the book with you until I read to you from my tablet.” My father read to him and there was no even one letter different from Jabir’s book. Jabir said: “I swear by Allah that I have seen the following written in the tablet: (In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. This is a book from Allah, the Mighty, the Wise to His messenger, His light, His screen, His deputy and His guide Muhammad. The Archangel Gabriel has revealed it from the Lord of the worlds. O Muhammad, glorify My attributes, be grateful to My blessings and do not deny them. I am Allah. There is no god but Me. I am the Destroyer of the arrogants, the Supporter of the oppressed, the Master of the Day of Judgement and I am Allah; there is no god but Me. Whoever expects for other than My favor or fears other than My justice, I will subject him to such a torment that I will never torture any one of people with; therefore worship Me and rely on Me. I have never sent a messenger unless I have appointed his guardian when his days were about to end. I have preferred you to all of the prophets. I have preferred your guardian to all of the guardians. I have granted you with your two grandsons; al-Hasan and al-Husayn. I have made al-Hasan the vessel of My knowledge after the end of his father’s time and made al-Husayn the essence of My revelation and so I have honored him with martyrdom and concluded his life with happiness. He is the best of those, who are martyred for the sake of Me. He has the highest rank among the martyrs near Me. I have put My perfect Word with him and My irrefutable proof near him. By the means of his progeny I reward and punish. The first of them is Ali, the master of the worshippers and the best of My previous saints. His son has the same name of his praiseworthy grandfather; Muhammad al-Baqir, who gets deep through My knowledge and wisdom. Those, who doubt Ja’far, will perish. One, who denies him, as if denies Me. It is a promise of Me that I will honor the abode of Ja’far. I will make him pleased with his followers and assistants. After him there will be a dark sedition. Definitely the thread of My guidance will never be cut and My proof will never disappear. My saints will drink with the full cup. They are My deputies on the earth. Whoever denies any one of them, denies My favors and whoever changes a verse of My Book fabricates lies against Me. Woe unto the fabricators and deniers when the time of My slave, beloved and choice Musa has elapsed. He, who mistrusts him, as if he has mistrusted all My loyal saints. He is My guardian and supporter and it is he, whom I try with the burdens of prophethood. After him is My deputy Ali bin Musa ar-Redha. He will be killed by an arrogant devil. He will be buried in the city, which has been built by My benevolent slave (Alexander the Great) Thul Qarnayn. The best of My people is buried beside the worst of My people. It is My promise that I will delight his eyes with his son Muhammad; the caliph after him and the heir of his knowledge. He is the vessel of My knowledge, the trustee of My secret and My proof and authority before My people. I have made Paradise as his abode and have accepted his intercession for seventy thousand ones of his relatives, who all deserve to be in Hell. I will end the life of his son Ali with contentment. He is My guardian and supporter. He is My witness among My people and the trustee, to whom My revelation is entrusted. I will make his son al-Hasan a propagandist for My mission and a keeper of My knowledge. Then I will complete that with his son; My mercy to My peoples. He has the perfection of Moses, the beauty of Jesus Christ and the patience of Ayyoob (Job). In his time my saints are despised and their heads fall like the heads of the Turks and the Daylams. They are killed and burned. They are always afraid. The ground is dyed with their bloods. Grief and wail spread among their women. Those are my real saints and I have to rid them of every dark sedition and all loads and restrictions. (Those are they on whom are blessings and mercy from their Lord, and those are the followers of the right course). Abu Baseer said: “If you have not heard along your age except of this tradition, it will have sufficed you. You are to keep it secret except for those, who are qualified for it.”"

This is for a variety of reasons, the first of which is considering the early authorship of this work— which seems to have been penned very shortly after the end of the minor occultation. Additionally, al-Nuʿmānī had the privilege of acquiring Ḥadīth from the great scholar al-Shaykh al-Kulaynī. The work itself consists of approximately 478 narrations which are spread across twenty-six chapters. The narrations themselves span a variety of topics, from discussions on the Imamate, the hardships and trials of the Shīʿa, signs of the Imam’s reappearance, and matters that speak of the nature of the governance of the Imam post-occultation. The traditions are chaptered in an excellent manner, making it easy for the reader to navigate— yet unlike other works written in this genre, the author rarely comments on the traditions within and allow them to speak for themselves.",Section 2,Chapter 4 | Twelve imams determined by Allah,Ḥadīth #6,6 - وأخبرنا أحمد بن محمد بن سعيد بن عقدة الكوفي، قال: حدثنا يحيى بن زكريا بن شيبان من كتابه سنة ثلاث وسبعين ومائتين، قال: حدثنا علي بن سيف بن عميرة، قال: حدثنا أبان بن عثمان، عن زرارة، عن أبي جعفر الباقر عن آبائه  قال: قال رسول الله: إنّ مِن أهل بيتي اثنا عشر محدّثاً. فقال له رجل يقال له عبد الله بن زيد وكان أخا عليِّ بن الحسين من الرضاعة: سبحان الله محدثاً؟ - كالمنكر لذلك - قال: فأقبل عليه أبو جعفر فقال له: أما والله إنّ ابن أمّك كان كذلك - يعني عليَّ بن الحسين -.,"(6) Ahmad bin Muhammad bin Sa’eed bin Oqda al-Kufi narrated from Yahya bin Zakariyya bin Shayban from Ali bin Sayf bin Omayra from Abban bin Uthman from Zurara from Imam Abu Ja’far al-Baqir from his fathers that the Prophet (S) had said: “From among my progeny there will be twelve inspired men.” A man called Abdullah bin Zayd, who was the foster-brother of Ali bin al-Husayn as-Sajjad , said to him (to Imam al-Baqir): “Glory be to Allah! Inspired!” as if he denied that. Imam Abu Ja’far al-Baqir said to him: “By Allah, the son of your mother -he meant Ali bin al-Husayn - was indeed inspired.”"

أحمد بن عبيد الله بن جعفر بن المعلى الهمداني، قال: حدثني أبو الحسن عمرو بن جامع بن عمرو بن حرب الكندي، قال: حدثنا عبد الله بن المبارك شيخ لنا كوفي ثقة، قال: حدثنا عبد الرزاق بن همام شيخنا، عن معمر، عن أبان بن أبي عياش، عن سليم بن قيس الهلالي. وذكر أبان أنه سمعه أيضا عن عمر بن أبي سلمة. قال معمر: وذكر أبو هارون العبدي أنه سمعه أيضا عن عمر بن أبي سلمة، عن سليم: أن معاوية لما دعا أبا الدرداء وأبا هريرة ونحن مع أمير المؤمنين علي بصفين فحمّلهما الرسالة إلى أمير المؤمنين علي وأدّياه إليه، قال: قد بلغتماني ما أرسلكما به معاوية فاستمعا مني وأبلغاه عني كما بلغتماني، قالا: نعم فأجابه علي الجواب بطوله حتى إذا انتهى إلى ذكر نصب رسول الله إيّاه بغدير خم بأمر الله تعالى قال: لما نزلَ عليه إِنَّمَا وَلِيُّكُمُ اللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُ وَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا الَّذِينَ يُقِيمُونَ الصَّلَاةَ وَيُؤْتُونَ

صلاتهم وزكاتهم وصومهم وحجهم. قال علي فنصبني رسول الله بغدير خم وقال: إن اللهَ أرسلني برسالةٍ ضاق بها صدري وظننتُ أنّ الناس مكذبوني، فأوعدني لأبلّغنَّها أو ليُعذبني، قُم يا عليُّ. ثمّ نادى بأعلى صوته بعد أن أمر أن يُنادى بالصلاة جامعة، فصلى بهم الظهر، ثم قال: يا أيها الناس إنّ الله مولاي، وأنا مولى المؤمنين، وأنا أولى بهم منهم بأنفسهم، مَن كنتُ مولاه فعليٌّ مولاه، اللهم والِ مَن والاه وعادِ مَن عاداه. فقام إليه سلمان الفارسي فقال: يا رسول الله ولاءُ ماذا؟ فقال: مَن كُنت أولى به من نفسه فَعَليٌّ أولى به من نفسه. فأنزل الله الْيَوْمَ أَكْمَلْتُ لَكُمْ دِينَكُمْ وَأَتْمَمْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ

ابني حُسين، ثمّ تسعةٌ من ولد الحسين واحداً بعد واحدٍ؛ هُم مع القرآنِ والقرآنُ معهم لا يفارقونه ولا يفارقهم حتى يردوا عليَّ الحوضَ. فقام اثنا عشر رجلاً من البدريين فقالوا: نشهد أنا سمعنا ذلك من رسول الله كما قلتَ يا أمير المؤمنين، سواء لم تزد ولم تنقص، وقال بقية البدريين الذين شهدوا مع عليٍّ صفين: قد حفظنا جُلَّ ما قلتَ، ولم نحفظ كله، وهؤلاء الإثنا عشر خيارُنا وأفاضلُنا. فقال عليٌّ: صدقتم ليس كل

قائمٌ إلى جانبه وهو يقول: يا أيُّها الناسُ، إنّ الله أمرني أنْ أُنصّبَ لكم إماماً يكون وصيّي فيكم وخليفتي في أهل بيتي وفي أمّتي من بعدي، والذي فرض الله طاعتَه على المؤمنين في كتابه وأمرَكم فيه

لها: وأنتِ إلى خير، إنمّا أنزلت فيَّ وفي أخي عليّ وفي ابنتى فاطمة وفي ابنيَّ الحسن والحسين وفي تسعة من ولد الحسين خاصة، ليس فيها معنا أحد غيرنا. فقام جلُّ الناس فقالوا: نشهد أن أمّ سلمة حدثتنا بذلك، فسألنا رسول الله فحدّثنا كما حدثتْنا أمُّ سلمة. فقال علي: ألستم تعلمون أنّ الله أنزل في سورة الحج يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا ارْكَعُوا وَاسْجُدُوا وَاعْبُدُوا رَبَّكُمْ وَافْعَلُوا الْخَيْرَ

الْمَوْلَىٰ وَنِعْمَ النَّصِيرُ فقام سلمان  عند نزولها فقال: يا رسول الله، مَن هؤلاء الذين أنتَ شهيد عليهم وهم شهداءُ على الناس الذين اجتباهم الله ولم يجعل عليهم في الدين من حرج ملّةَ أبيهم إبراهيم؟ فقال رسول الله: عنيَ اللهُ تعالى بذلك ثلاثة عشر إنساناً: أنا وأخي عليّاً وأحد عشر من ولده؟ فقالوا: اللهم نعم! قد سمعنا ذلك من رسول الله . فقال عليّ: أنشد كم بالله تعلمون أن رسول الله قام خطيباً ثم لم يخطبْ بعد ذلك، فقال: أيّها الناس إني قد تركتُ فيكم أمرَين لن تضلّوا ما إنْ تمسّكتم بهما؛ كتاب الله وأهل بيتي، فإنّ اللطيف الخبير قد أخبرني وعهِد إليّ أنهما لن يفترقا حتى يردا عليَّ الحوضَ؟ فقالوا: نعم اللهم، قد شهِدنا ذلك كلَّه من رسول الله ، فقام اثنا عشر رجلاً من الجماعة فقالوا: نشهد أن رسول الله حين خطب في اليوم الذي قُبض فيه قام عمر بن الخطاب شِبه المُغضب فقال: يا رسول الله، لكلّ أهل بيتك؟ فقال: لا، ولكن لأوصيائي منهم: عليٌّ أخي ووزيري ووارثي وخليفتي في أمّتي ووليُّ كل مؤمن بعدي، وهو أوّلهم وخيرهم، ثم وصيّه بعده ابني هذا -وأشار إلى الحسنِ- ثم وصيّه ابني هذا -وأشار إلى الحسين-، ثم وصيه

وشهِدوا به.,"(8) From the book of Sulaym bin Qayss al-Hilali there was a tradition narrated by Ahmad bin Muhammad bin Sa’eed bin Oqda, Muhammad bin Hammam bin Suhayl and Abdul Aziz and Abdul Wahid the sons of Abdullah bin Younus al-Moossili from their companions; Abdurrazak bin Hammam, Ma’mar bin Rashid, Abban bin Abu Ayyash and Sulaym bin Qayss. From another way the tradition was narrated by Haroon bin Muhammad from Ahmad bin Obaydillah bin Ja’far bin al-Mu’alla al-Hamadani from Abul Hasan Amr bin Jami’ bin Amr bin Harb al-Kindi from Abdullah bin al-Mubarak from Abdurrazak bin Hammam from Ma’mar from Abban bin Abu Ayyash from Sulaym bin Qayss al-Hilali. Abban said that he also had heard it from Umar bin Abu Salama. Ma’mar said that Abu Haroon al-Abdi had also heard it from Umar bin Abu Salama that Sulaym had said: “When Mo’awiya sent for Abud Darda’ and Abu Hurayra, while we were with Amirul Mo’mineen in (the battle of) Siffeen, and gave them a letter to be given to Amirul Mo’mineen Ali , Imam Ali said to the two messengers after receiving the letter: “You informed me of what Mo’awiya have sent with you. Then listen to me and inform him of what I shall say to you.” They said: “Yes, we do.” Imam Ali replied with a long answer until he mentioned the matter when the Prophet (S) had appointed him (Imam Ali) in Ghadeer Khum as the guardian and the caliph after him (after the Prophet) according to the order of Allah. He said: “When this verse “Only Allah is your guardian and His Messenger and those who believe, those who keep up prayers and pay the poor-rate while they bow,” was revealed to the Prophet (S), the people asked him: “O messenger of Allah, does it concern some of the believers particularly or the all in general?” Then Allah ordered His messenger to declare for them the guardian, whom Allah had chosen, and to explain for them the matter of guardianship as he had explained the matters of prayer, zakat, fasting and hajj. Imam Ali said: “The Prophet (S) appointed me (as guardian) in Khum and said: “Allah the Almighty has revealed to me something, which my chest became unable to bear and I thought that people would not believe me if I announced, then Allah threatened me either to announce it or He would punish me.” He ordered his companions to call for the prayer. He led them in offering the Dhuhr prayer and then he asked Ali to get up. He said to the people very loudly: “O people, Allah is my guardian and I am the guardian of the believers. I am worthier of them than themselves. Whoever I am his guardian, Ali is to be his guardian. O Allah, support whomsoever supports him and be the enemy of whoever opposes him!” Salman al-Farisi got up and said: “O messenger of Allah, what guardianship is it?” The Prophet (S) said: “Whoever that I am worthier of than himself, has to consider Ali as worthier of him than himself.” Then Allah revealed, “This day have I perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion.” Salman said: “O messenger of Allah, have these verses been revealed about Ali?” The Prophet (S) said: “About him and about my guardians until the Day of Resurrection.” Salman asked: “O messenger of Allah, would you please tell me about them?” The Prophet (S) said: “They are my brother, guardian, son-in-low, heir, the caliph of my umma and the guardian of every believer after me, Ali and eleven imams of my progeny; the first of them is my son Hasan then my son Husayn and then nine imams from al-Husayn’s progeny one after the other. They are with the Qur’an and the Qur’an is with them. They will never part with it nor will it part with them until they will come to me at the pond in Paradise.” Twelve men from among those, who had fought with the Prophet (S) in the battle of Badr, got up and said: “O Amirul Mo’mineen, we witness that we have heard this from the Prophet (S) exactly as you say no word more no word less.” The rest of companions (of Badr) said: “We have memorized the most of what you said but not all of it. These twelve men are the best of us.” Imam Ali said: “You are right. Not all of the people can memorize everything. Some are better than the others (in memorizing).” From among those twelve men four men; Abul Haytham bin at-Tayhan, Abu Ayyoob, Ammar and Khuzayma bin Thabit got up and said: “We witness that we have memorized the saying of the Prophet (S) then. He said while he was standing up and Ali was standing beside him: “O people! Allah has ordered me to appoint for you an imam, who will be my guardian among you and the successor in my family and my umma after me. Allah has imposed upon the believers, In His Book, to obey him and ordered them to submit to him. I said: O my God! I fear that the hypocrites may not believe me. Then He threatened me either to inform of it or He would punish me. O people, Allah has ordered you in His Book to offer prayers, which I have explained to you. He has ordered you of zakat and fasting, which also I have explained to you. He has ordered you, in His Book, of the guardianship and I call you, O people, to witness that this concerns particularly this (Ali) and the guardians of my progeny and his progeny. The first of them is my son al-Hasan then al-Husayn and nine of al-Husayn’s progeny. They will never part with the Book until they come to me at the pond (in Paradise). O people, I have informed you of your resort, your imam, guardian and guide after me. He is Ali bin Abu Talib. He is my brother and he is among you as I have been among you. Entrust him with your religion and obey him in all of your affairs. He has all what Allah has taught me. Allah has ordered me to teach it to him and to inform you that he has learned it. Ask him and learn from him and from his guardians. Do not try to teach them. Do not precede them and do not lag behind them because they are with the truth and the truth is with them. They never part with the truth nor will it part with them.” Then Imam Ali said to Abud Darda’, Abu Hurayra and those around him: “O people, do you know that when Allah revealed in His Book, “Allah only desires to keep away the uncleanness from you, O people of the House! and to purify you a (thorough) purifying,” the Prophet (S) gathered me, Fatima, Hasan and Husayn with him under one garment and said: “O Allah, these are my beloved family, my weighty thing I have left and the people of my house. O Allah, keep away the uncleanness from them and purify them.” Umm Salama said: “And Me!” The Prophet (S) said: “You will be of a pleasant fate. This verse has been revealed concerning me, my brother Ali, my daughter Fatima, my sons al-Hasan and al-Husayn and nine ones of al-Husayn’s progeny and no one else.” Most of people available there got up and said: “We witness that Umm Salama has narrated this for us. We asked the Prophet (S) and he confirmed what Umm Salama had narrated.” Imam Ali said: “Do you not know that Allah has revealed in the sura of al-Hajj these verses, “O you who believe! bow down and prostrate yourselves and serve your Lord, and do good that you may succeed. And strive hard in (the way of) Allah, (such) a striving a is due to Him; He has chosen you and has not laid upon you any hardship in religion; the faith of your father Ibraheem; He named you Muslims before and in this, that the Messenger may be a bearer of witness to you, and you may be bearers of witness to the people.” And then Salman asked the Prophet (S): “O messenger of Allah, who are these people, whom you are the witness on and who are the witnesses on people and whom Allah has chosen and has not laid upon them any hardship in religion; the faith of their father Ibraheem?” The Prophet (S) said: “Allah has meant by that thirteen persons; me, my brother Ali and eleven ones of his progeny.” They said: “Yes, by Allah, we have heard that from the Prophet (S).” Imam Ali said: “I adjure you before Allah! Have you known that the Prophet (S) has made a speech that he has not made other speech after it when he said: “O people, I have left among you two things; the book of Allah and my family. If you keep to them, you will never go astray at all. The Archangel Gabriel has informed me and promised me that they will never separate until they come to me at the pond (in Paradise)”? They said: “Yes, by Allah, we have witnessed all that from the Prophet (S).” Then twelve men got up and said: “We witness that when the Prophet (S) made a speech in the last day of his life, Umar bin al-Khattab got up angrily and said: “O messenger of Allah, all the people of your house?” The Prophet (S) said: “No, only my guardians; Ali, my brother, vizier, heir, the caliph of my umma and the guardian of every believer after me, who is the first of them and the best of them, and then his guardian after him; my son-he pointed to al-Hasan- then his guardian; my son-he pointed to al-Husayn- then his guardian, whose name is like the name of my brother (Ali) then his guardian after him, whose name is like mine then seven ones; his (Muhammad bin Ali’s) son and (six) grandsons one after the other until they come to me at the pond. They are the witnesses of Allah on His earth and the authorities over His people. He, who obeys them, obeys Allah and he, who disobeys them, disobeys Allah.” Seventy men, who had fought with the Prophet (S) in the battle of Badr, and nearly the same number of al-Muhajireen got up and said: “You reminded us of what we have forgotten. We witness that we have heard that from the Prophet (S).” Abud Darda’ and Abu Hurayra left and told Mo’awiya of all that Imam Ali had said and that the people had witnessed of.”"
Kitāb al-Ghayba,The Book of Occultation,,Abū ʿAbd Allah Muḥammad b. Ibrāhīm al-Nuʿmānī,Abdullah al-Shahin,"Kitāb al-Ghayba, written by al-Shaykh Muḥammad b. Ibrāhīm al-Nuʿmānī is a vital work regarding the occultation of the 12th Imam (a). This is for a variety of reasons, the first of which is considering the early authorship of this work— which seems to have been penned very shortly after the end of the minor occultation. Additionally, al-Nuʿmānī had the privilege of acquiring Ḥadīth from the great scholar al-Shaykh al-Kulaynī.

A handsome and neat old man came out of the monastery. He had a book in his hand. He came to Amirul Mo’mineen, greeted him and said: “I am from the progeny of one of the disciples of Jesus Christ . He was the best of the twelve disciples of Jesus Christ and the most beloved one to him. Jesus Christ had entrusted him with his wills, given him his books and taught him his knowledge and wisdom. The progeny of this disciple had been still keeping to the faith of Jesus Christ. They had never disbelieved or apostatized from his religion. The books are still with me. They had been written by the hand of our forefather according to the dictation of Jesus Christ himself. Every thing that would happen after him had been mentioned in these books and the names of all the kings, who would rule after him, one after the other. It had been mentioned that Allah the Almighty would send a man from among the Arabs as a prophet. He would be from the progeny of Ishmael the son of Abraham. He would be from a land called Tehama and a village called Mecca. His name would be Ahmad. He would have twelve names. His advent, birth, emigration, who would fight him, who would support him, who would be his enemies, how long he would live and what his umma would face after him until Jesus Christ would descend from the Heaven had been mentioned in these books. The names of thirteen men of the progeny of Ishmael the son of Abraham had been mentioned in the book and that they were the best of all of the peoples and the most beloved ones to Allah. Allah would be the guardian of whoever believed in them and would be the enemy of whoever opposed them. Whoever obeyed them would be guided and whoever disobeyed them would go astray. Obeying them would mean obeying Allah and disobeying them would mean disobeying Allah. Everything about them had been mentioned such as their names, lineage, aspects, how long each one of them would live, how many ones of them would conceal their faith before their people and which one of them would appear and then all the peoples would submit to him until Jesus Christ would descend from the Heaven and then he (Jesus Christ) would offer prayers behind him and would say: “You are the imams and no one is to precede you.” Then he would advance to lead the people in offering the prayer and Jesus Christ would stand behind him in the first row. The first of them and the best of them is the messenger of Allah. His names are Muhammad, Abdullah, Yasseen, al-Fattah (the conqueror), al-Khatam (the last), al-Hashir (the resurrector), al-Aaqib (the successor), al-Mahi (the eraser), al-Qa’id (the leader), the prophet of Allah, the best friend of Allah and the beloved of Allah. He is the most honored of all the people before Allah and the most beloved to Him. Allah has never created an honored angel or a prophet since Adam better than him near Allah or more beloved to Allah than him. Allah will seat him on His Throne on the Day of Resurrection and will accept his intercession for everyone he intercedes for. With his name; Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, the Pen writes on the Divine Tablet and with the keeper of the banner on the Day of the Great Resurrection, his guardian, vizier and successor for his umma. The most beloved one to Allah after him, Ali; his cousin and the guardian of every believer after him and then eleven men of Muhammad and Ali’s progeny, the first two of them are named as the names of the two sons of Aaron; Shubbar and Shubayr, and nine of the progeny of the youngest of them one after the other, behind the last of whom Jesus Christ will offer the prayers.” Then he mentioned the rest of the tradition."

ووضع يدَه على رأس الحسن - ثم ابني هذا - ووضع يدَه على رأس الحسين -، ثم ابنٌ له على اسمِك يا عليّ، ثم ابنٌ له محمّد بن علي. ثمّ أقبل على الحسين وقال: سيولد محمّد بن علي في حياتك فأقرِئه مني السلام، ثم تكمله اثني عشر إماماً. قلت: يا نبيّ الله سمِّهم لي، فسمّاهم رجلاً رجلاً. منهم، واللهِ يا أخا بني هلال، مهديُّ هذه الأمّةِ الذي يملأُ الأرضَ قسطاً وعدلاً كما مُلئتْ ظلماً وجوراً.,"(10) The previous series of narrators from Abdurrazak from Ma’mar from Abban that Sulaym bin Qayss al-Hilali had said: “I said to Ali : “I have heard from Salman, al-Miqdad and Abu Tharr some interpretations of the Qur’an and some traditions of the Prophet (S) different from what the people have had with them and I heard from you what confirmed that I have heard from those men. In the meanwhile I found among the people some interpretations of the Qur’an and some prophetic traditions, in which they denied those interpretations and traditions (narrated by those three men) and claimed that they were false. Do you think that they (the people) ascribed false things to the Prophet (S) and interpreted the Qur’an according to their own opinions?” Ali said: “With people there are truth and falsehood, abrogating and abrogated verdicts, special and general verdicts, allegorical and clear Qur’anic verses, memorization and illusion. False things were ascribed to the Prophet (S) when he was still alive until he made a speech saying: “O people, the fabricators, who ascribed false things to me, became so many. Let him, who ascribes false things to me intendedly, take his seat in Hell.” Nevertheless many people ascribed false things to him after his death. The narrators of traditions are of four kinds; one is a hypocrite showing faith with his tongue only. He does not refrain from ascribing false things to the Prophet (S) intendedly. If people know that he is a hypocrite and a liar, they will never believe him or accept anything from him but they see that he has accompanied the Prophet (S), has seen him and heard from him; therefore they trusted in him without knowing his reality. Allah has told us about the hypocrites and described them to us when saying, “And when you see them, their persons will please you, and If they speak, you will listen to their speech; (they are) as if they were big pieces of wood clad with garments; they think every cry to be against them. They are the enemy, therefore beware of them; may Allah destroy them, whence are they turned back.” They kept on that after the Prophet (S) and approached to the deviant rulers, who invited people towards Hell via lies and fabrications. They entrusted them with positions and authorities and imposed them on people by force. They hastened towards the pleasures of this worldly life. In fact most of people follow the kings and look forward to the pleasures of this life except a few, whom Allah has guided. The other kind is a man, who heard something from the Prophet (S) and could not memorize it correctly. He mistook when narrating it without intending to fabricate it. If the Muslims knew that he had mistaken, they would not accept a tradition from him and if he himself knew that his tradition was incorrect, he would deny it. The third is a man, who heard the Prophet (S) ordering of something and then the Prophet (S) prohibited it but the man did not know or he heard the Prophet (S) prohibiting something and then he permitted it but the man did not know; therefore he memorized the abrogated verdict and ignored the abrogating verdict. If he knew that it had been abrogated, he would deny it and if people, when hearing it, knew that it had been abrogated, they would deny it. The fourth one is he, who never fabricates the sayings of Allah or the sayings of His messenger because he hates lying, fears Allah and glorifies the Prophet (S). He does not forget but he keeps the tradition as he hears it. He narrates it with no word more and no word less. He knows the abrogating and the abrogated verdicts. He acts according to the abrogating verdicts and refuses the abrogated ones. The orders and prohibitions of the Prophet (S) are like those of the holy Qur’an; among them there are abrogating and abrogated verdicts, particular and general, allegorical and clear sayings. Allah says, “Whatever the Messenger gives you, accept it, and from whatever he forbids you, keep back.” Many people hear the allegorical sayings and do not know what Allah and His messenger mean. Not all of the Prophet’s companions used to ask about many things to understand them well. They often liked that a nomad or a passerby might ask the Prophet (S) so that they would hear the answer. I used to come to the Prophet (S) once in the day and once in the night. He let me alone with him. The Prophet’s companions knew well that the Prophet (S) did not do that with anyone else than me. The Prophet (S) often came to my house and when I came to him in one of his houses, he asked his wives to leave us alone. But when he came to my house, Fatima would stay with us and would not leave nor would any of my sons. If I began asking, he would answer me and if I finished my questions and became silent, he would begin talking to me and praying Allah to make me perceive and memorize. Since he has prayed Allah for me, I have never forgotten anything at all. Once I said to the Prophet (S): “O messenger of Allah, since you have prayed Allah for me, I have never forgotten anything of what you have taught me and dictated to me. But you have not ordered me to write it down. Do you not fear that I may forget?” He said: “O my brother, I do not fear that you may forget or ignore any thing. Allah has revealed to me that He has responded to my praying for you and your partners coming after you. But you are to write it down for them.” I asked: “O messenger of Allah, who are my partners?” He said: “They are those, whom Allah has connected with Himself and me when He said: (O you who believe! Obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those in authority from among you). If you fear that you may quarrel about something, then refer it to Allah, the Messenger and those of authority among you.” I said: “O messenger of Allah, who are they?” He said: “They are the guardians, one after the other, until they come to me at the pond (in Paradise). Every one of them is guided and he is a guide for people. They will not be affected by disappointment of anyone, who will disappoint them. They are with the Qur’an and the Qur’an is with them. They will not part with the Qur’an nor will it part with them. By them my umma will win and by their praying the heaven will rain for people and calamities will be away from them.” I said: “O messenger of Allah, would you tell me their names?” He said: “My son; this-and he put his hand on al-Hasan-then my son; this-he put his hand on al-Husayn-then his son, whose name will be like your name, O Ali, then Muhammad the son of Ali.” Then he turned towards al-Husayn and said: “Muhammad bin Ali will be born during your life. Give him my regards! Then will be the rest of the twelve imams.” I said: “O messenger of Allah, would you tell me their names?” He mentioned their names one after the other. O Sulaym, by Allah, from them is al-Mahdi of this umma. He will spread justice and equity allover the world after it has been filled with injustice and oppression.”"

He said to me that Gabriel had told him that Allah had known that the umma would disagree and separate after him (the Prophet). He asked for a sheet of paper and dictated to me what he wanted to write in the tablet before people. He let three persons witness that. They were Salman al-Farisi, Abu Tharr and al-Miqdad. He mentioned the names of the imams of guidance, whom he ordered the believers to obey until the Day of Resurrection. He mentioned my name as the first of them then my son Hasan and then my son Husayn and then nine ones from the progeny of my son Husayn. Was it not so, O you Abu Tharr and you al-Miqdad?” They said: “We witness that the Prophet (S) has done so.” Talha said: “By Allah I have heard the Prophet (S) saying to Abu Tharr: “By Allah, the earth has not carried nor has the sky shaded one more truthful or more pious than Abu Tharr.” I witness that they (Abu Tharr and al-Miqdad) have not said but the truth and you are more truthful and more pious to me than them both.”"

He became very angry. He went to the minbar. Al-Ansar took up their arms when they saw the Prophet (S) so angry. He said: “Why do some people criticize my close relatives after they have heard me mentioning that Allah has preferred them to all of the people and has favored them by purifying them and taking uncleanness away from them? They have heard me mentioning the virtues of my family and the virtues of my guardian, whom Allah has honored and preferred because of his precedence in being a Muslim, his defending Islam, his kinship to me and that he is to me as has Aaron been to Moses. After all, someone of you claims that I am, among my family, like a date-palm growing in a dunghill! Allah has created his creation and divided them into two parties. He has made me in the best of them. Then He has divided this party into three groups and made me in the best of them and in the best tribe. Then He divided them into families and made me in the best of them until I have been purified with my brother Ali bin Abu Talib from among the family. Allah the Almighty looked at the people of the earth and chose me from among them and then He looked again and chose Ali; my brother, vizier, heir, my caliph for my umma and the guardian of every believer after me. Whoever obeys him, obeys Allah and whoever opposes him, opposes Allah. Whoever loves him will be loved by Allah and whoever hates him will be hated by Allah. No one loves him except the believers and no one hates him except the unbelievers. He is the basis of the earth and its ease after me. He is the word of piety and the firmest handhold of Allah. “They desire to put out the light of Allah with their mouths, and Allah will not consent save to perfect His light.” The enemies of Allah want to put out the light of my brother but Allah will not consent save to perfect his light. O people, let the present inform the absent of my speech! Then Allah looked thirdly and chose some ones from among my family after me. They are the best of my umma; eleven imams after my brother (Ali) one after the other. Whenever one of them leaves to the better world another one will replace him. Their example is like the stars of the sky; whenever a star sets another will shine. They are guided and guiding imams. They will never be affected by the disappointment of their opponents nor by the plotting of their enemies. They are the authorities of Allah on the earth and His witnesses over His people. Whoever obeys them, obeys Allah and whoever disobeys them disobeys Allah. They are with the Qur’an and the Qur’an is with them. They will never part with the Qur’an nor will it part with them until they come to me at the pond (in Paradise). The first of the imams is my brother Ali, who is the best of them, then my son Hasan, then my son Husayn and then nine ones from the progeny of Husayn.” He mentioned all the tradition."

Whoever doubts this matter, will be unbeliever before Allah. I swear that his name will be like mine and his surname will be like mine. He will be the seventh after me. He will fill the world with justice and equity after it has been filled with injustice and oppression. O Abu Hamza, he, who will attend his (Imam al-Mahdi’s) appearance and will not submit to him, has not submitted to Muhammad and Ali (peace be upon them) and then he will be forbidden from being in Paradise, his abode will be the fire, and evil is the abode of the unjust!” Clearer than this is the saying of Allah: “Surely the number of months with Allah is twelve months in Allah’s ordinance since the day when He created the heavens and the earth, of these four being sacred; that is the right religion; therefore be not unjust to yourselves regarding them.” Knowing the months is not to be considered as the right religion because the Jews, the Christians, the Magi and all peoples know the number and the names of the months. They are but the twelve imams, who are the guardians of the religion. Among the four sacred ones is Imam Ali , whose name Allah has derived from His name as He has derived the name of the Prophet (S). Three other imams have the name Ali. They are Ali bin al-Husayn, Ali bin Musa and Ali bin Muhammad. So this name (Ali), which has been derived from one of the attributes of Allah, has deserved to be sacred.

While I was sitting with him, (his son) Abul Hasan Musa (al-Kadhim) came in. He was a young boy. I got up and kissed him and then I sat down. Abu Abdullah said to me: “O Ibraheem, he will be your companion after me. Because of him many people will perish and others will be pleased. May Allah damn his killer and double the torment for his soul! Allah will derive from him the best of the people on the earth in his time. His name will be like the name of his grandfather. He will be the heir of his grandfather’s knowledge, wisdom and judgements. He will be the essence of the imamate and the top of wisdom. He will be killed by the arrogant of so-and-so family after some wonders because of envy. But Allah will carry out His order even the polytheists are averse. Allah will derive from his progeny the rest of the twelve inspired imams, whom He will honor with dignity of His and will place in the sanctuary of His. He, who waits for the twelfth imam and fights with him, is as if he has fought with the Prophet (S) and defended him.” Then a man of the freed slaves of the Umayyads came in and Imam as-Sadiq stopped talking. I visited him eleven times wishing that he might complete his speech but I failed. In the next year I came to him. He said: “O Ibraheem, he will relieve his Shia from their grief after long strait, affliction, oppression and fright. Blessed is he, who will attend at that time! O Ibraheem, this suffices you.” I have never come back with something more pleasant to my heart and more delightful to my eye than this thing.”"

Then Ali came and offered greeting but he could not overstep the people to reach the Prophet (S) and the people did not let him pass. When the Prophet (S) saw that, he raised his pillow and said: “O Ali, come to me!” Then people pressed closed to let Ali pass. The Prophet (S) seated Ali beside him and said: “O people, you do so to my family while I am still alive! Then what will you do to them after my death? By Allah, whatever closer you approach to my family, you will be closer to Allah and whatever far you become and turn away from them, Allah will turn away from you. O people, listen to what I say to you! Contentment and love of Allah will be to whoever loves Ali, obeyed him and followed him and his guardians after him. Allah has promised to respond to me regarding them. They are twelve imams. Whoever follows them is from me. I am from Abraham and Abraham is from me. His religion is my religion and my religion is his. His lineage is mine and mine is his. My virtue is his and I am better than him without pride.

While we were sitting around Umar, who had been paid homage to be the caliph, a young Jew from the Jews of Medina, whose father was the jurisprudent of the Jews in Medina and the Jews claimed that he was one of Aaron’s descendants, came to Umar. He greeted him and said: “O Amirul Mo’mineen, who is the most aware of your Book and the Sunna of your prophet among you?” Umar said: “It is this one. (He pointed to Ali bin Abu Talib.) This is the most aware of our Book and our Prophet’s Sunna.” The young Jew said (to Ali): “Would you answer my questions?” Imam Ali said: “Yes, I would. Ask me as you like.” The young boy said: “I ask you about three things and three things and one thing.” Imam Ali said: “Why do you not say: I ask you about seven things?” The young boy said: “No, but I ask you about the first three and if you give the right answers then I will ask you about the other three and if you give the right answers then I will ask you about the last one. If you fail to answer the first three ones, I will keep silent and not ask you about anything.” Imam Ali said: “If I give you the right answer, will you know that my answer is right or not?” He said: “Yes, I will.” Imam Ali said: “I adjure you before Allah that if I give you right answers, you are to be a Muslim and to give up Judaism.” He said: “I agree. I promise you to be a Muslim and to give up Judaism.” Imam Ali said: “Then ask me as you like.” The young Jew said: “Would you tell me about the first stone that has been put on the surface of the earth, the first tree that has grown on the earth and the first fountain that has flowed on the earth?” Imam Ali said: “O Jew, as for the first stone that has been put on the surface of the earth, the Jews has claimed that it is the rock, which is in Jerusalem, but they have told a false thing. It is the Black Stone that Adam has brought from Paradise and put in the corner (of the Kaaba). The believers kiss it to renew the covenant of being loyal to Allah. As for the first tree, the Jews have claimed that it is the olive tree but they have told a lie. It is the date-palm, which Adam has brought with him from Paradise. And as for the first fountain, the Jews have claimed that it is the one under the rock (in Jerusalem) but they have told a lie. It is the fountain of life, in which a dead is dipped to be alive again. It is the fountain of Moses , beside which he has left the salted fish and when water touched it, it revived and slipped into the sea and then Moses and his servant followed it when they met with al-Khidhr .” The young Jew said: “I swear that you have said the truth. This is a book that I have inherited from my ancestors. It has been dictated by Moses and written by Aaron . It has these seven things. By Allah, if you give right answers to the rest of the seven questions, I will give up my religion and believe in yours.” Imam Ali said: “Ask!” The Jew said: “Would you tell me how many imams of guidance, who will not be harmed by the disappointment of the plotters, this umma will have after its prophet? In which position Muhammad will be in Paradise? How many ones will be with Muhammad in his position?” Imam Ali said: “This umma has twelve imams. All of them are guided and guiding imams and they will never be harmed by the disappointment of the plotters. The position of Muhammad is in the best position of the Garden of Eden, the most honored and the closest to Allah. As for those, who will be with Muhammad in his position, they are twelve imams.” The Jew said: “I swear that you have said the truth. If you answer the last one as you have done with these six, by Allah I will be a Muslim before you and give up Judaism.” Imam Ali said: “Ask!” He said: “Would you tell me how long the successor of Muhammad will live after Muhammad? Will he die or be killed?” Imam Ali said: “He will live for thirty years and then this will be dyed (of blood) from this. (He grasped his beard and made a sign with his head.)” The young Jew said: “I witness that there is no god but Allah, Muhammad is the messenger of Allah and you are the caliph of the umma after the Prophet (S). Whoever precedes you, will be oppressive.” Then he left."

He asked what the matter was. It was said to him that the Prophet (S) had died. He said: “Indeed he has died on the same day mentioned in our Book.” Then he asked where people were. It was said to him that they had been in the mosque. He came to the mosque where there were Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman, Abdurrahman bin Ouff, Abu Obayda bin al-Jarrah and a great crowd of people. He said: “Make way to let me come in and lead me to the one, whom your prophet has entrusted with his umma!” They led him to Abu Bakr. He said to Abu Bakr: “I am a Jew and I am from the descendants of Prophet David . I have come to ask about four things. If you answer me, I become a Muslim.” He was asked to wait a little. Then Amirul Mo’mineen Ali came in from one of the gates of the mosque. People said to the Jew: “Go to this young man!” When he came near to him, he asked: “Are you Ali bin Abu Talib?” Imam Ali said to him: “Are you so-and-so the son of David ?” He said: “Yes, I am.” Imam Ali took the Jew’s hand and came with him to Abu Bakr. The Jew said to Imam Ali : “I asked these people about four things but they sent me to you.” Imam Ali said: “Please ask!” The Jew asked: “What was the first thing that was revealed to your prophet when he came back from his Lord after his Ascension? Who was the angel that pushed your prophet away and did not greet him? Who were the four men, from above whom Angel Malik had removed a cover of Fire and who had talked with your prophet? In which position of Paradise will the minbar of your prophet be?” Imam Ali said: “The first thing that Allah has revealed to our prophet after the Ascension is: (The messenger believes in what has been revealed to him from his Lord).” The Jew said: “It is not this that I mean.” Imam Ali said: “Then it is (and (so do) the believers; they all believe in Allah).” He said: “It is not this that I mean.” Imam Ali said: “Then let the matter be hidden.” The Jew said: “You are to tell me the truth. Are you not the one, whom I mean?” Imam Ali said: “As you insist on that, I shall tell the truth. When the Prophet (S) came back from his Lord, where the screens were opened before him, and before he got to the place of Gabriel, an angel had called: “O Ahmad!” The Prophet (S) said: “Here I am.” The angel said: “Allah sends you His greeting and says to you: “Deliver Our greeting to the master of guardians.” The Prophet (S) asked: “Who is the master of guardians?” The angel replied: “He is Ali bin Abu Talib.” The Jew said to Imam Ali : “You are right. I have found that in my father’s book.” Imam Ali said: “As for the angel, who had pushed the Prophet (S) away, he was the Angel of Death. He had come from an arrogant of the people of the earth, who had uttered something that made Allah angry. Then Gabriel said to the Angel of Death: “This is Ahmad, the beloved messenger of Allah.” The Angel of Death came back, embraced the Prophet (S), apologized and said to him: “O messenger of Allah, I went to a tyrant king, who uttered bad things that made me very angry so that I did not know you.” The Prophet (S) accepted his apology. As for the four men, from above whom Angel Malik had removed a cover of Fire, that when the Prophet (S) passed by Angel Malik, who had never smiled since he had been created at all, Gabriel said: “O Malik, this is Muhammad, the prophet of mercy.” Then Malik smiled to the Prophet (S) and he did never smile to anyone else than Muhammad . The Prophet (S) said to Gabriel: “Order him to uncover a layer of Fire!” He uncovered a layer of Fire and there appeared Qabeel (Cain), Nimrod, Pharaoh and Haman. They said: “O Muhammad, ask your god to send us back to the worldly life in order to do good!” Gabriel became angry and with a feather of his wing he returned the layer of Fire upon them. As for the minbar of the Prophet (S), the abode of the Prophet (S) is the Garden of Eden, which Allah has created with His (hand). There are twelve guardians will be with the Prophet (S) in this Garden. Above this abode there is a dome called the dome of ar-Radhwan (contentment). Above the dome there is a house called al-Wasseela (the means), which no house in Paradise looks like it. It is the minbar of the Prophet (S).” The Jew said: “By Allah, you are right. This has been mentioned in the book of my father David . The book has been inherited by one after the other until it has reached me.” Then he took out a book written by Prophet David and said to Imam Ali : “Give me your hand! I witness that there is no god but Allah and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah. It is he, of whom Prophet Moses has informed. And I witness that you are the jurisprudent of this umma and the guardian of the messenger of Allah.” Then Imam Ali began to teach him the laws of Islam.” The Book of Allah, the traditions of the Prophet (S), Imam Ali and all the imams one after the other had confirmed that the number of the imams is twelve. No one among the Shia denies that the book of Sulaym bin Qayss al-Hilali is considered as one of the important books of the doctrine of the Shia. All that is mentioned in the book has been narrated from the Prophet (S), imam Ali , al-Miqdad, Salman al-Farisi Abu Tharr and their likes, who have accompanied the Prophet (S) and Amirul Mo’mineen . It is one of the sources that the Shia have depended on and referred to."

The traditions show clearly that the Prophet (S) has meant by the twelve caliphs the twelve imams of his descendants. The tradition, saying that commotion will take place, refers to the commotion that will happen after the end of the rule of Imam al-Mahdi (al-Qa’im), the commotion that will last for fifty years. Several twelve rulers have ruled after the Prophet (S) or after Imam Ali , who has been the only true caliph. Definitely the Prophet (S) has referred by his sayings to the twelve infallible imams of his progeny, who are with the Qur’an and the Qur’an is with them and who will never part with the Qur’an until they come to the Prophet (S) at his pond in Paradise. Furthermore there are other evidences mentioned in the Torah confirming our subject. It has been mentioned in the first book of the Old Testament when talking about the story of Ishmael and after the end of the story of Sara. Allah has addressed Prophet Abraham , concerning the matter of his wife and her child, by saying: (I have responded to your prayer regarding Ishmael. I have blessed him and I will do more and more. He will beget twelve great men. I will make them imams as a great nation.) Abdul Haleem bin al-Husayn as-Samriy read to me what a Jew man called al-Husayn bin Sulayman, who was one of the Jewish jurisprudents, had dictated to him in Arrajan. The names and the number of the imams had been mentioned in Hebrew. From among what he had read to me was this passage: “One of the descendants of Ishmael will be delegated (as a prophet). He is called Mabad or Mamad that it means Muhammad. He will be a master over people. From his progeny there will be twelve men. They will be imams and masters, whom people will imitate. Their names are: Taqobeet, Feethwa, Thabeera, Mafssora, Massmoo’a, Domoh, Thabo, Hathar, Yathmo, Bator, Nouqass and Qeedmuwa.” The Jew had been asked about these names and he said that they had been mentioned in the story of Prophet Solomon . He had mentioned another passage of the story: (From the progeny of Ishmael a blessed boy is born. My blessing and mercy be upon him. Twelve men of his progeny are honored and glorified. The name of this man is elevated and glorified and his mention is exalted.) This speech was read to Musa bin Imran bin Zakariyya the Jew and he confirmed it. Iss’haq bin Ibraheem bin Bakhtwayh Bahsoon al-Fasawi and Sulayman bin Dawood an-Noubenjani, who were Jews, confirmed it too. The Qur’an, the traditions narrated by the Shia from the Prophet (S) and the infallible imams, the traditions narrated by the Sunnis, the previous divine Books and their followers has confirmed that the imams are twelve ones. After all, is there any excuse for the deniers and the resisters? These are sufficient evidences for those, whom Allah has guided to His pure religion and straight path. Surely those, who deny the infallible imams, will lose. Allah has said addressing His prophet: You are only a warner and (there is) a guide for every people. In every age there is an imam, by whom Allah guides those who follow him and believe in him and He leaves those who deny him (the imam) and turn away from him to their own opinions and analogies."

His example is like a sheep that has lost the shepherd or the flock. It goes and comes astray. It becomes confused at day and when night comes, it sees a flock with a shepherd. It is deceived to spend the night with them in their fold. When morning comes and the shepherd drives his flock, it denies the shepherd and the flock and goes confusedly looking for its flock and shepherd. Then it sees another flock with a shepherd. It is deceived to join them. The shepherd cries: “O you lost sheep, go to join your shepherd and flock. You are astray and confused. You have lost your shepherd and flock.” Then it hastens confusedly without a shepherd guiding it to its pasture or to its fold. While it is so, a wolf seizes the opportunity and eats it. O bin Muslim, by Allah it is the same with you. Whoever of this umma becomes without an imam, definitely will be confused, astray and deviant. If he remains so, he will die as an unbeliever and polytheist. O Muhammad bin Muslim, know that the real imams and their followers are on the true religion of Allah and the imams of injustice and oppression are away from the religion of Allah and away from the truth. They go astray and lead people astray. Their actions are (like ashes on which the wind blows hard on a stormy day; they shall not have power over any thing out of what they have earned; this is the great error).” The same was narrated by Ali bin Ahmad from Obaydillah bin Musa from Muhammad bin Ahmad al-Qalanisi from Issma’eel bin Mihran from Ahmad bin Muhammad from Abdullah bin Bukayr and Jameel bin Darraj from Muhammad bin Muslim from Imam Abu Ja’far as-Sadiq ."

Have you not heard the saying of Allah (Allah is the guardian of those who believe. He brings them out of the darkness into the light)? It means that Allah will bring them out of the darkness of sins into the light of repentance and forgiveness because of their submitting to the just imams appointed by Allah. Then Allah has said, “…And (as to) those who disbelieve, their guardians are Shaitans who take them out of the light into the darkness.” So which light that the unbeliever will be out of? Certainly it is the light of Islam. When those people follow the unjust imams, they come out of the light of Islam into the darkness of disbelief; therefore Allah has rewarded them with being in Fire with the unbelievers.

If they have agreed upon one man, we will submit to his orders. I have believed that the imamate is among them. May Allah have mercy upon them all. Abu Abdullah as-Sadiq said: “He will die as an unbeliever.” The same was narrated by Ali bin Sayf from his brother al-Husayn from Mu’ath bin Muslim from Imam as-Sadiq . Let those of understanding, who believe in the guardianship of the infallible imams of Ahlul Bayt, ponder on the traditions narrated from the Prophet (S), Imam Abu Ja’far al-Baqir and Imam Abu Abdullah as-Sadiq talking about those, who have doubted anyone of the twelve imams or have spent a night without knowing their imam. These traditions have considered such people as unbelievers, hypocrites and polytheists. Let them also ponder on the traditions that have said: “Whoever denies one of the alive imams is as if he has denied the dead ones.” Let men of understanding look well for the one, whom they will follow, without being deceived by fancies and falsehood in order no to deviate from the path of the truth. Let them know well who will be the means between them and their Creator, Who is One and Only, whereas the devils are so many. Allah has said: “…The Shaitans from among men and jinn, some of them suggesting to others varnished falsehood to deceive (them).” We pray Allah to save us and our brothers in faith from deviating from the truth and guidance and not to let us welter in the abysses of confusion and perishment. We look forward to His mercy; He is merciful to the believers."

They (the authorities) are either apparent without being obeyed or afraid, hidden and awaiting. If their persons are absent from people during their truce in the state of untruth, their knowledge will never be absent from them (from people). Their principles are fixed in the hearts of the believers, who act according to these principles. They become pleasant with what the liars become unpleasant and with what those, who are indifferent to the obligations of Allah, deny. Speech that is measured without any price; but is there any one hearing it with his mind, perceiving it, believing in it and following it as an ideal to succeed with it? And who is he? Therefore knowledge is lost because there is no one to bear it, to preserve it and to teach it as it is heard from the ulama.” Then he said after a long speech: “O Allah, I know well that knowledge is not lost totally nor its means disappear because You do not leave the earth without an authority over Your people; either apparent and obeyed or afraid, absent and disobeyed lest Your proofs will be vain and Your faithfuls will go astray after You have guided them.” The same was narrated by Muhammad bin Ya’qoob al-Kulayni from Ali bin Muhammad from Sahl bin Ziyad from Muhammad bin Yahya and others from Ahmad bin Muhammad from Ali bin Ibraheem from his father from al-Hasan bin Mahboob from Hisham bin Salim from Abu Hamza ath-Thimali from Abu Iss’haq as-Subay’iy from one of Imam Ali’s trusted companions."

Some of knowledge is difficult and unbearable. Mountains will fail to bear it. Our knowledge (principles), we Ahlul Bayt, will be denied and annulled, the narrators will be killed and whoever mentions something of it, will be harmed offensively. All that is because of envy at the progeny of the Prophet’s guardian . O bin al-Yaman, the Prophet (S) has spit in my mouth, passed his hand over my chest and prayed Allah to me by saying: “O Allah, give my caliph, my guardian, the payer of my debts, the executor of my promises and deposits, my assistant and supporter against Your enemy and my enemy and the reliever of my distresses the knowledge that You have given to Adam, the discernment that You have given to Noah, the magnanimity and good offspring that You have given to Abraham, the patience before calamities that You have given to Ayyoob (Job), the strength that You have given to David when confronting heroes and the understanding that You have given to Solomon. O Allah, do not hide any thing of this life from Ali until You make it (life) as a small table before him. O Allah, give him the endurance of Moses and make in his progeny a like of Jesus. O Allah, I pray You to be the trustee after me for him and his pure progeny, whom You have kept uncleanness away from and whom You have turned the influence of the Satan away from. O Allah, if Quraysh extorts his right and prefers others to him, then make him as was Aaron to Moses when Moses left him alone.” Then he said to me: “O Ali, many great men of your descendants will be killed before the eyes of people whereas the people will not try to do anything!! Fie on a nation looking at the progeny of its prophet being killed unjustly without trying to change anything. The one, who has ordered of killing, the killer and the one, who sees the killing without trying to change the situation all participate in committing the sin and all are the same in being damned. O ibn al-Yaman, people of Quraysh will not be pleasant nor will their hearts be contented nor will their tongues be able to pay homage to Ali except unwillingly and lowly. O ibn al-Yaman, Quraysh will pay homage to Ali and then will break the homage, will fight him and will fabricate great lies against him. Then after Ali al-Hasan comes and the same will be done to him then comes al-Husayn, who will be killed by the nation of his grandfather. Damned is a nation that kills the son of its prophet’s daughter, damned is the leader and damned is the planner of its offenders. By Him, in Whose hand the soul of Ali is, this umma, after killing my son al-Husayn, will remain in deviation, darkness, tyranny, oppression, disagreement on the religion, changing what Allah has revealed in His Book, spreading heresies, annulling the Sunna, disorder, personal analogies and leaving the clear laws of Allah until this umma becomes detached from Islam and immerses in confusion and loitering. O Umayyads! May you be not guided! O Abbasids! May calamities afflict you! Everyone among the Umayyads is unjust and everyone among the Abbasids is offensive, sinful and mutinous against Allah. They will kill my descendants and trespass my honor. The people of this umma will remain arrogants rushing madly upon the impermissible pleasures of this life and immersing in seas of destruction and in valleys of bloods until my son (Imam al-Mahdi) disappears (by the will of Allah) from the sights of people and the people become so confused whether he is lost, killed or is dead. Then sedition will come upon, calamities befall, party spirit appears, people exaggerate in their religion and agree upon that the authority (al-Hujjah) has been gone and the imamate has been annulled. In that year the pilgrims, whether the followers or the enemies of Ali, will go to hajj just to spy on the existence of the guardian (al-Hujjah) and to seek any information about him but with no use nor will any news be known about him. There will be no guardian and then the Shia of Ali will be abused by their enemies and will be overcome by the evil and bad people with their protest until the umma becomes so confused and begins to say that al-Hujjah has perished and the imamate has been annulled. By the god of Ali, their authority (al-Hujjah) will remain over the umma walking in its roads, entering into its houses and palaces, roving in the east and in the west, hearing the speech, greeting groups of people and seeing without being seen until the promised time and determined appointment come and then comes the call from the heaven: This is the day that brings forth joy to the descendants of Ali and to the Shia of Ali.” This tradition has many evidences confirming the beliefs of the Shia. This saying of Imam Ali : “…until my son (Imam al-Mahdi) disappears (by the will of Allah) from the sights of people” is a sufficient evidence that confirms the disappearance of the last imam and confirms the thought of those, who acknowledge this disappearance and believe in the disappeared imam. Then Imam Ali says: “…and the people become so confused whether he is lost, killed or is dead… and agree upon that the authority (al-Hujjah) has been gone and the imamate has been annulled.” Does this not comply with the opinion of most of the people now, who think that the belief of the Shia concerning the disappearance is unreal and nonsense? Then he says: “In that year the pilgrims will go to hajj just to spy on…” and they really have done so but without any use. And he says: “…and then the Shia of Ali will be abused by their enemies and will be overcome by the evil and bad people with their protest”. He means that they protest against the Shia by saying: Where is your imam? Can you show him to us? They abuse the Shia by ascribing contradiction, weakness and ignorance to them for they say that their imam is existent but cannot be seen. The saying of Imam Ali confirms the truthfulness of the Shia and describes their opponents of being ignorant and opponents to the truth. He swears by his god when saying: “By the god of Ali, their authority (al-Hujjah) will remain over the umma walking in its roads, entering into its houses and palaces, roving in the east and in the west, hearing the speech, greeting groups of people and seeing without being seen”. Does this not refute any doubt about the subject? Does it not confirm the matter and confirm the previous tradition saying: “Know well that the world will not be empty of an authority (Hujjah) from Allah but Allah will make His people not see His authority because of their injustice, oppression and excessiveness in disobedience”? Then he gives an example by mentioning Prophet Joseph . Imam al-Mahdi (aj) is existent in substance and person but at his time he sees and he is not seen until-as Amirul Mo’mineen says: “the promised time and determined appointment” when the call comes from the heaven: “This is the day that brings forth joy to the descendants of Ali and to the Shia of Ali.”"

These are whom (the fire shall scorch their faces, and they therein shall be in severe affliction).” It was said to him: “O Ka’b, who are these people, whose condition will be so?” He said: “It is those, who have kept on deviation, apostasy and breaking the homage. Evil is that which their souls have sent before for them when they will meet Allah with the sin of fighting the caliph and the guardian of their prophet, their most aware jurisprudent, their most virtuous master, the bearer of the banner, the guard of the pond, the hope and the hoped one out of all this world, the knowledge that is never ignored, the straight path, from which whoever deviates will perish and fall in Fire. It is Ali, by the god of Ka’b, who is the most aware of them, the senior in peace (Islam) and the most discerned of all of them. I wonder at those, who prefer others to Ali. From among the descendants of Ali is al-Qa’im al-Mahdi, who will change the world into another one and by whom Jesus Christ will argue against the Christians of Rome and China. Al-Qa’im al-Mahdi is the most similar one to Jesus Christ in form, character, nobility and dignity. Allah will give him all what He has given to the prophets and more than that and He will prefer him to the all. Al-Qa’im, the descendant of Ali , will disappear like the disappearance of Prophet Joseph and will reappear like the reappearance of Jesus the son of Mary . He will reappear, after his disappearance, with the appearance of the red star, the destruction of az-Zawra’ (ar-Riy), the sinking of al-Muzawarra (Baghdad), the rising of as-Sufyani, the war of the progeny of al-Abbas against the people of Armenia and Azerbaijan, in which thousands and thousands will be killed. Each one of the warriors will seize on an adorned sword, over which black banners will flutter. It will be a war full of red death and terrible plague.”"

It is a gang with no morals, prevailing over the evils, deceiving the tyrants and destroying the kings (rulers). It is a gang that appears in Kufa headed by a black-faced and black-hearted man, who is weak in faith, with no morals, hybrid, mean and rude. He is circulated among prostitute mothers from the worst progenies. May Allah have no a bit of mercy upon them. They will appear in the same year, in which my disappearing son with the red banner and the green flag will reappear. What a terrible day for the deviants between Anbar and Heet it will be! A day, on which a great misfortune will occur to the Kurds and the (Kharijites), on which there will be the destruction of the house (city) of the Pharaohs (tyrants), the abode of the arrogants, the shelter of the unjust rulers, the mother of calamities and the sister of shame! O Amr bin Sa’d, by the god of Ali, it is Baghdad! May Allah damn the mutineers of the Umayyads and the Abbasids; the traitors, who will kill my virtuous descendants, who will never regard my sanctity when killing them and who will not fear Allah when doing anything to my progeny. Woe unto the followers of the Abbasids from a war that will break out between Nahawand and ad-Daynour. It will be the war of the paupers of Ali’s Shia headed by a man from Hamadan, whose name will be like the name of the Prophet (S).”"

Whoever tries to deprive Ahlul Bayt of their rights-and how many they are-will perish no doubt and just a few, who have believed in the infallible imams and whom Allah has fixed faith in their hearts and assisted with His mercy, will be saved from that rough sea of seditions. Definitely Allah will fix the true believers on the straight path of His guardians in spite of the seditions, the different doctrines, the contradicted opinions and the betraying of the apostates, who have deviated from the right path of the divine imamate and will reward them with the best of His favors by joining them to His honored guardians."

He said: “How will that be and yet the orbit has not turned nor has it been said: Has he died, perished or which valley has he followed?” I (Abdul Kareem) asked him: “What is the turning of the orbit?” He said: “It is the disagreement of the Shia among themselves.” These traditions refer to the conditions of the different groups that are ascribed to Shiism. They have deviated from the real Shia, who believe in the imamate of the twelfth imam Muhammad bin al-Hasan bin Ali al-Mahdi (aj). The Sunni say when talking about the expected imam: Where is he? How can his disappearance and reappearance be? Until when will he disappear? How long will he live and eighty years have passed since he has disappeared till now? Some of them say that he is dead. Others deny his being born and deny his existence at all. They scorn those, who believe in him. Some think that the period is too long and that Allah is unable to make His guardian live so long in concealment and then reappear again! We have seen many people of our time outliving for more than a hundred years. They have been sane and healthy until the last moment of their lives. Then how do thy deny the ability of Allah to make His authority outlive for more than that and to make that as one of His great signs among His people? Have they not read the story of Moses mentioned in the Qur’an? When Moses was born, a great number of women and children were killed in order to prevent the will of Allah from being realized but in spite of all what the Pharaoh had done; Allah had carried out His will. The great sign of Allah was that the Pharaoh, who had killed the great number of women and children in order to perish the chance of bringing life to the expected prophet, himself had brought Moses up and in his own palace since being a baby until becoming a young man. “Such has been the course of Allah that has indeed run before, and you shall not find a change in Allah’s course.” O people of understanding, learn a lesson and you, the Shia, keep to what Allah has guided you to and praise Him for the great favor He has distinguished you with."

As they are in such a condition, their star will shine to them.” Abban said: “May I die for you! What will we do and what will happen then?” He said: “Keep to what you have kept to until Allah brings the master (of the matter).” These traditions confirm the truth of the disappearance (of Imam al-Mahdi) and of the limitation of knowledge, which refers to the authority. Throughout these traditions, the infallible imams have ordered the Shia to keep on what they have believed in and to wait for that they have been promised of. They are excused when not seeing their authority and imam during the period of the disappearance. The ignorant, who are not aware of what the infallible imams have said through their traditions about the disappearance of al-Qa’im , ask to be led to the person and the place of al-Qa’im . They ask to see him with their eyes and they deny his disappearance because they are far away from knowledge and jurisprudence. They deny the sayings of the infallible imams whereas they have been ordered to obey Allah, His messenger and His guardians and have been warned of disobeying them. Allah has said: “…Therefore let those beware who go against his order lest a trial afflict them or there befall them a painful chastisement.” “O you who believe! obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those in authority from among you.” “And obey Allah and obey the messenger and be cautious; but if you turn back, then know that only a clear deliverance of the message is (incumbent) on Our messenger.” In the fourth tradition it was said “…that you do not find an imam of guidance nor any banner”. This referred to what had really happened and confirmed the matter of the deputies, who had been between the imam and his Shia but their job stopped after some time. The deputy between the imam, during his disappearance, and the Shia was like the banner. When people were afflicted with the ordeal, the banners disappeared and would not reappear until the expected imam would reappear. Also the confusion that the infallible imams had told of occurred. The second disappearance of al-Qa’im also took place. It will be discussed in a next chapter."

The brothers of Prophet Joseph were skilled, intelligent and sons of prophets. When they came to him, they talked and dealt with him and although they were his brothers they could not know him until he himself told them that he was their brother Joseph. Then why do this umma deny that Allah may want to hide His authority from people for a certain time? Prophet Joseph was the king of Egypt and there was between him and his father a distance of eighteen days-travel. If he wanted to inform his father of his place, he could do that. By Allah, Jacob and his sons, after having heard the news of Joseph, traveled from their village to Egypt within nine days. So why do this umma deny that Allah may do for his authority (al-Mahdi) as He has done for Prophet Joseph ? Perhaps the master of this matter (al-Qa’im), who has been wronged and whose right has been denied, goes and comes among people frequently, walks in their markets and sits on their mats but they do not know him until the will of Allah permits him to introduce himself to them as Allah has permitted Prophet Joseph to introduce himself to his brothers by saying: (They said: Are you indeed Yousuf? He said: I am Yousuf).

Definitely he will remove all the heresies created by the heretics, whom Allah has not let taste the sweetness of faith and knowledge. Then the little group, whom Allah has favored with faith and belief in the imamate and let not deviate as much many groups have deviated and followed the Satan wherever he goes; left or right, is to thank and praise Allah for this great blessing in not being among those, whom the Satan has made hate faith and truth and like deviation. Let this little group be so grateful to Allah for making them obey His guardians, whom He has ordered to be obeyed. Allah says when talking about Iblis: “He (Iblis) said: Then by Thy Might I will surely make them live an evil life, all except Thy servants from among them, the purified ones.” “And most certainly I will lead them astray and excite in them vain desires.” “I will certainly lie in wait for them in Thy straight path.” Imam Ali says in one of his speeches: “I am the firm ‘rope’ of Allah. I am the straight path. I am the authority of Allah over His people after His messenger Muhammad …” Then Allah says when talking about Iblis: “And certainly the Satan found true his conjecture concerning them, so they follow him, except a party of the believers.” Be awake from the doze of advertence and fancy. Do not let what the infallible imams have said go in vain! Care for it with attentive hearts and reflecting minds! Be guided that Allah may keep the Satan away from you in order not to be among his (Satan’s) submissive followers where Allah says: “Surely, as regards My servants, you have no authority over them except those who follow you of the deviators.”"

Only the little group has believed and kept on believing in the expected Imam following, by that, the saying of Amirul Mo’mineen : “Do not feel desolate in the way of guidance when its followers are very few!”"

After one of his disappearances, he comes back to his family and in the other one it is said that he has perished or (it is unknown that) which valley he has followed.” I said: “If that takes place, then what will we do?” He said: “If someone pretends that (he is al-Qa’im), you are to ask him about the great matters, which no one will answer except him (al-Qa’im).” These traditions mention that al-Qa’im disappears twice. Allah has confirmed the sayings of the infallible imams . The first disappearance was the one, during which the deputies between Imam al-Mahdi (aj) and the people were apparent in persons and positions. By them the obscure matters of knowledge and vague judgments were cleared. The answers to all questions and problems, which were asked about, were given by these deputies. This was the short disappearance, whose period had elapsed. In the second disappearance there were no deputies or mediators. It was the will of Allah to try His people and to sift them after letting confusion spread among them. Allah said: “On no account will Allah leave the believers in the condition which you are in until He separates the evil from the good; nor is Allah going to make you acquainted with the unseen.” The second disappearance has taken place. We pray Allah to make us from among those, who keep to the truth and not among those, who slip away after the sifting of seditions. It is this that has been meant by “two disappearances” or “disappears twice”."

He wrote down what he said to me and gave me the book.” Salim said: “Hussayn showed us the book. He read what there was in it before us and then said: This is the book of Abu Ja’far (al-Baqir) .”"

O people, whoever argues with me about Adam, I am worthier of Adam than all the people. Whoever argues with me about Noah, I am worthier of Noah.

Are the deputies not the supporters, whom the Shia refer their affairs to during the disappearance of their imam to be delivered to the imam? By losing the imam and the means between them and their imam, the Shia become like the goats subjected to the test to be tried that which of them is to perish and which of them is to be saved.

A group that has fought with the Prophet (S) in the battle of Badr, that none of them has been killed or has died, will fight with them (with the imam and his followers).” Imam Ali means that when the imam of the age (al-Mahdi) disappears from the sight of people, the Shia becomes confused and they disagree among themselves. Some of them still keep to the truth (fertile hearts) and others deviate from the truth (barren hearts). Then he says that the ill-wishers will be perished because they do not submit to Allah and they want Him to hasten His order. They see that the period become too long and so they perish before the coming of deliverance. Allah saves the patient and submissive believers and rewards them with what they deserve. They are the few true believers as Imam Ali has said that they are three hundred ones or a little more, whom Allah qualifies to support His guardian and to fight His enemy. They are the rulers, the viziers and the assistants of al-Qa’im over the world after the war comes to an end and the world enjoys peace. Then Imam Ali says that “A group that has fought with the Prophet (S) in the battle of Badr and that none of them has been killed or has died will fight with them.” He means that Allah will assist al-Qa’im with the three hundred or more of the angels, who have assisted the Prophet (S) and his companions in the battle of Badr."

It will be for some of our descendants.” Then he added: “From his (ibn Abbas’s) progeny there are some descendants created to be in Hell.

By Allah, I love you and love whoever loves you. O my master, how many your Shia are!” Abu Abdullah as-Sadiq said: “Would you please mention them?” The man said: “They are too many.” He said: “Could you count them?” The man said: “They are much more than to be counted.” Abu Abdullah as-Sadiq said: “If the number becomes three hundred and a little more then what you want will happen. Our Shia are those, whose voice dose not pass beyond their ears, nor does their zeal go beyond their body, nor do they praise us openly, nor quarrel with anyone because of us, nor sit with anyone criticizing us, nor talk with anyone abusing us, nor love whoever hates us and do not hate whoever loves us.” The man said: “Then how do we deal with these different groups, who pretend that they are Shia?” He said: “They will be tried, purified and distinguished. Years come that will perish them, a sword that will kill them and disagreement that will scatter them. Our real Shia are those, who do not growl like a dog, do not covet like a crow and do not ask people for alms even if they die of hunger.” The man said: “May I die for you! Where can I find such a kind of people?” He said: “You can find them in the far sides of the world. They are those, whose lives are so simple, whose abodes move from place to another, who if are seen, will not be known, if absent, will not be missed, if become ill, will not be visited, if propose to a woman, will not be married and if die, their funerals will not be attended. It is they, who divide their monies among them, who visit each other in their graves and who never disagree even if their countries are different.” The same was narrated by Muhammad bin Hammam from Hameed bin Ziyad al-Kufi from al-Hasan bin Muhammad bin Suma’a from Ahmad bin al-Hasan al-Maythami from Ali bin Mansoor from Ibraheem bin Muhzim al-Asadi from his father from Abu Abdullah as-Sadiq but with an addition: “If they see a believer, they will honor him and if they see a hypocrite, they will leave him aside. They do not worry when about to die and they visit each other in their graves…”"

They warn strongly of turning away from their Sharia by saying: “one believes in our matter in the morning and recants it in the evening or he believes in it in the evening and when morning comes he recants it.” It is a clear evidence showing neglecting the system of the imamate with all its concerns that lead to the straight path.

By Allah, you are going to be broken like the breaking of pottery but pottery is never remade as before.” Those, who believe in the doctrine of the infallible imams and then recant it and then they repent and return to the true belief when the mercy of Allah declares to them the purity of what they deny and the darkness of what they enter into, are like broken glass that it can be remade as before but those, who recant the true belief and remain in their confusion without repenting until death, are like broken pottery that cannot be remade as before because there is no repent after death."

That, which you look forward to, will not be except after despair. That, which you look forward to, will not be until he, who is to be wretched, becomes wretched and he, who is to be happy, becomes happy.” The same was narrated by Muhammad bin Ya’qoob from Muhammad bin al-Hasan and Ali bin Muhammad from Sahl bin Ziyad from Muhammad bin Sinan from Muhammad bin Mansoor as-Sayqal from his father but with a little difference."

All the birds deem them weak but if they know what blessing there is inside their (the bees’) interiors, they will not do that to them. Mix with people with your tongues and persons and be far away from them with your hearts and deeds. I swear by Him, in Whose hand my soul is, you will not meet what you like until a time comes that you spit at the face of each other, call each other as liars and until none of you remains except like the kohl in an eye and like the salt in food. I give you an example. It is like a man having some food (grains). He sifts and purifies it and then he keeps it in a store for some time. Then he comes back to find that his food has been worm-eaten. He takes it out, purifies it and puts it back into the store for some time. After a time he comes to find that his food has been worm-eaten again. He takes it out, purifies it and puts it back into the store. He does so again and again until nothing of his food remains except the least, which will never be harmed by the worms. So are you! You are going to be clarified until none of you remains save a very few ones, who will never be affected by seditions.” The same was narrated by Ahmad bin Muhammad bin Sa’eed from Ali bin al-Hasan at-Taymali from Muhammad and Ahmad the sons of al-Hasan from their father from Tha’laba bin Maymoon from Abu Kahmas and others from Amirul Mo’mineen .

Therefore when Imam al-Mahdi (aj) reappears as a young man, they deny him. The infallible Imams have declared that when saying: “They (people) separate into different sects, walk in various ways of seditions and are deceived by the mirage of the infatuates’ speech. So when he (al-Qa’im) appears to them after these many years, which definitely make one too old, too weak and with curved back, as a young man, those, whose hearts are full of diseases, will deny him but the true believers, whom Allah has favored with His kindness, will still believe in him and keep to him.” They, who believe in all that the infallible imams have said and wait for the expected imam faithfully and with no a bit of doubt or confusion and who are not deceived by the fabrications of the Satan and his followers, definitely will win in the afterlife."

He is from the people, who do not cower when death hastens, do not weaken when the end approaches and do not recede when the heroes clash. He is always a winner like a lion. He will do away with the oppressors and the arrogants. He is a sword of Allah’s. He arises from loftiness. His glory emits from a great glorious family. Let none of those, who hasten towards seditions and who when saying, the evilest of sayers and when keeping silent, fishing in the troubled water, prevents you from paying homage to him.” Then he talked again about the aspects of al-Mahdi (aj) by saying: “He is the most generous, the most aware and the kindest of you to his kin. O Allah, make his advent as deliverance from distresses and make the umma unite by him! O you man, if Allah chooses (that) to you, be determined and do not deviate from him (al-Mahdi) when you are guided to him.” He sighed and pointed at his chest with his hand showing his eagerness to see him.”"

اللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَحِيمٌ وأمر الإمامة من تمام الدين، لم يمض حتى بيّن لأمّته معالم دينهم، وأوضح لهم سبيلهم، وتركهم على قول الحق وأقام لهم علياً علماً وإماماً، وما ترك شيئاً يحتاج إليه الأمة إلاّ بيّنه، فمن زعم أن الله لكم يكمل دينه فقد ردّ كتاب الله، وهو كافر به. هل يعرفون قدر الإمامة ومحلّها من الأمة فيجوز فيها اختيارهم؟ إنّ الإمامة أجل قدراً وأعظم شأناً وأعلى مكاناً وأمنع جانباً وأبعد غوراً مِن أن يبلغَها الناس بعقولهم أو ينالوها بآرائهم أو يقيموا إماماً باختيارهم. إن الإمامة منْزلة خصّ الله بها إبراهيمَ الخليل بعد النبوة والخلّة مرتبةً ثالثة وفضيلةً شرّفه بها وأشاد بها ذكره فقال وَإِذِ ابْتَلَىٰ إِبْرَاهِيمَ رَبُّهُ بِكَلِمَاتٍ فَأَتَمَّهُنَّ ۖ قَالَ إِنِّي جَاعِلُكَ لِلنَّاسِ إِمَامًا ۖ قَالَ وَمِنْ ذُرِّيَّتِي ۖ قَالَ لَا يَنَالُ عَهْدِي الظَّالِمِينَ فقال الخليل سروراً بها قَالَ وَمِنْ ذُرِّيَّتِي قال الله تعالى لَا يَنَالُ عَهْدِي الظَّالِمِينَ ، فأبطلت هذه الآية إمامةَ كلّ ظالم إلى يوم القيامة وصارت في الصفوة. ثم أكرمه الله بأن جعلها في ذريته أهل الصفوة والطهارة فقال وَوَهَبْنَا لَهُ إِسْحَاقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ نَافِلَةً ۖ وَكُلًّا جَعَلْنَا صَالِحِينَ وَجَعَلْنَاهُمْ أَئِمَّةً يَهْدُونَ بِأَمْرِنَا وَأَوْحَيْنَا إِلَيْهِمْ فِعْلَ الْخَيْرَاتِ وَإِقَامَ الصَّلَاةِ وَإِيتَاءَ الزَّكَاةِ ۖ وَكَانُوا لَنَا عَابِدِينَ فلم تزل في ذريته يرثها بعضٌ عن بعض قرناً فقرناً حتى ورثها النبي فقال إِنَّ أَوْلَى النَّاسِ بِإِبْرَاهِيمَ لَلَّذِينَ اتَّبَعُوهُ وَهَٰذَا النَّبِيُّ وَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا ۗ وَاللَّهُ وَلِيُّ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ فكانت له خاصّة، فقلّدها علياً بأمر الله عزّ اسمُه على رسم ما فرضه الله، فصارت في ذريته الأصفياء الذين آتاهم الله العلم والإيمان بقوله وَقَالَ الَّذِينَ أُوتُوا الْعِلْمَ وَالْإِيمَانَ لَقَدْ لَبِثْتُمْ فِي كِتَابِ اللَّهِ إِلَىٰ يَوْمِ الْبَعْثِ ۖ فَهَٰذَا يَوْمُ الْبَعْثِ وَلَٰكِنَّكُمْ كُنْتُمْ لَا تَعْلَمُونَ فهي في ولْد علي خاصة إلى يوم القيامة إذ لا نبيّ بعد محمد ، فمِن أين يختار هؤلاء الجهالُ الإمامَ. إنّ الإمامة هي منْزلة الأنبياء وإرث الأوصياء. إن الإمامة خلافة الله وخلافة الرسول ومقام أمير المؤمنين وميراث الحسن والحسين إن الإمامة زمام الدين ونظام أمور المسلمين وصلاح الدنيا وعزّ المؤمنين. إن الإمامة هي أس الإسلام النامي وفرعه السامي. بالإمام تمام الصلاة والزكاة والصيام والحج والجهاد، وتوفير الفيء والصدقات وإمضاء الحدود والاحكام ومنع الثغور والأطراف. الإمام يحل حلال الله ويحرم حرام الله ويقيم حدود الله ويذب عن دين الله ويدعو إلى سبيل ربه بالحكمة والموعظة الحسنة والحجة البالغة. الإمام الشمس الطالعة المجللة بنورها للعالم وهي في الأفق بحيث لا تنالها الأيدي والأبصار. الإمام البدر المنير والسراج الزاهر والنور الساطع والنجم الهادي في غياهب الدجى وأجواز البلدان والقفار ولجج البحار. الإمام الماء العذب على الظماء والنور الدالّ على الهدى والمنجي من الردى. الإمام النار على اليفاع الحار لمن اصطلى به والدليل في المهالك، مَن فارقه فهالكٌ. الإمام السحاب الماطر والغيث الهاطل والشمس المضيئة والسماء الظليلة والأرض البسيطة والعين الغزيرة والغدير والروضة. الإمام الأنيس الرفيق والوالد الشفيق والأخ الشقيق والأم البرة بالوالد الصغير ومفزع العباد في الداهية الناد. الإمام أمين الله في خلقه وحجته على عباده وخليفته في بلاده والداعي إلى الله والذابّ عن حرم الله. الإمام المطهر من الذنوب والمبرء عن العيوب المخصوص بالعلم الموسوم بالحلم، نظام الدين وعزّ المسلمين وغيظ المنافقين وبوار الكافرين. الإمام واحد دهره لا يدانيه أحدٌ ولا يعادله عالم ولا يوجد منه بدل ولا له مثل ولا نظير، مخصوص بالفضل كله من غير طلب منه له ولا اكتساب، بل اختصاص من المفضل الوهاب. فمَن ذا الذي يبلغ معرفة الإمام أو يمكنه اختياره؟ هيهات هيهات! ضلّت العقول وتاهت الحلوم وحارت الألباب وخسئت العيون وتصاغرت العظماء وتحيّرت الحكماء وتقاصرت الحلماء وحصرت الخطباء وجهلت الألبّاء وكلّت الشعراء وعجزت الأدباء وعييت البلغاء عن وصف شأنٍ من شأنه أو فضيلة من فضائله، فأقرّت بالعجز والتقصير. وكيف يوصف بكلّه أو ينعت بكنهه أو يفهم شيء من أمره أو يوجد مَن يقوم مقامه ويغني غناه؟ لا كيف وأنى وهو بحيث النجم من يد المتناولين ووصف الواصفين، فأين الاختيار من هذا؟ وأين العقول عن هذا، وأين يوجد مثل هذا؟ أتظنون أن ذلك يوجد في غير آل الرسول محمد ؟ كذّبتهم واللهِ أنفسُهم ومنّتهم الأباطيل فارتقوا مرتقاً صعباً دحضاً تزلّ عنه إلى الحضيض أقدامُهم. راموا إقامةَ الإمام بعقول حائرة بائرة ناقصة وآراء مضلة فلم يزدادوا منه إلاّ بعداً، لقد رامو صعباً وقالوا إفكاً وضلوا ضلالاً بعيداً ووقعوا في الحيرة إذ تركوا الإمام عن بصيرة، وزيّن لهم الشيطانُ أعمالهم فصدّهم عن السبيل وكانوا مستبصرين. رغبوا عن اختيار الله واختيار رسول الله وأهل بيته إلى اختيارهم، والقرآنُ يناديهم وَرَبُّكَ يَخْلُقُ مَا يَشَاءُ وَيَخْتَارُ ۗ مَا كَانَ لَهُمُ الْخِيَرَةُ ۚ سُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ

والعلم والعبادة، مخصوصٌ بدعوة الرسول ونسل المطهرة البتول، لا مغمز فيه في نسب ولا يدانيه ذو حسب، فالبيت من قريش، والذروة من هاشم، والعترة من الرسول والرضى من الله ، شرف الأشراف، والفرع عن عبد مناف، نامي العلم، كامل الحلم، مضطلع بالإمامة، عالم بالسياسة، مفروض الطاعة، قائم بأمر الله ، ناصح لعباد الله، حافظ لدين الله. إنّ الأنبياء والأئمة صلوات الله عليهم يوفقهم الله ويؤتيهم من مخزون علمه وحكمه ما لا يؤتيه غيرهم، فيكون علمهم فوق علم أهل الزمان في قوله تعالى قُلْ هَلْ مِنْ شُرَكَائِكُمْ مَنْ يَهْدِي إِلَى الْحَقِّ ۚ قُلِ اللَّهُ يَهْدِي لِلْحَقِّ ۗ أَفَمَنْ يَهْدِي إِلَى الْحَقِّ أَحَقُّ أَنْ

had said: We were with Imam ar-Redha in Marw. We met with our companions in the mosque on Friday. They discussed the matter of the imamate. They mentioned how much disagreement there was about this subject. I came to my master Imam ar-Redha and told him of what people had discussed. He smiled and said: “O Abdul Aziz, the people have ignored and have been deceived by their opinions. Allah has not make His messenger die until He has perfected the religion and revealed the Qur’an to detail everything; permissible and impermissible things, judgements and penalties and every thing that people might need in their lives. Allah has said, “We have not neglected anything in the Book,” and He has revealed to His messenger in the last (farewell) hajj this verse, “This day have I perfected for you your religion and completed My favor on you and chosen for you Islam as a religion.” Definitely the matter of the imamate is from the religion and that religion is not perfected without it. The Prophet (S), before leaving to the better world, has declared to his umma the principles of their religion and has showed them the straight path and the clear truth. He has appointed to them Ali as the imam. He has not left anything that the umma need unless he has declared it to them. Then whoever claims that Allah has not perfected His religion denies the Book of Allah and so he becomes unbeliever. Do they know the importance of the imamate and its position to the umma so that they determine as they like? The imamate is much more important, greater in position, higher in rank, more impervious and profounder than to be perceived by their own minds or to be refuted by their own opinions or that they themselves appoint the imam according to their fancies. The imamate is a divine position that Allah has favored Abraham with after prophethood then He has honored him with companionship thirdly. Allah has said, “Surely I will make you an Imam of men.” Abraham said delightfully, “And of my offspring?” Then Allah has said, “My covenant does not include the unjust.” So this verse has annulled every imamate of every unjust one until the Day of Resurrection and it limited the imamate to the choice that Allah has chosen. The choice is the progeny of Abraham that Allah has honored and preferred to all of the human beings. Allah has said, “And We gave him Issaq and Yaqoub (Jacob), a son’s son, and We made (them) all good and We made them Imams who guided (people) by Our command, and We revealed to them the doing of good and the keeping up of prayer and the giving of the alms, and Us (alone) did they serve.” It has been still in Abraham’s progeny inherited by one after the other and age after age until it has been inherited by Prophet Muhammad . Allah has said, “Most surely the nearest of people to Ibrahim are those who followed him and this Prophet and those who believe and Allah is the guardian of the believers.” Then the Prophet (S) has entrusted Ali with it (the imamate) according to the order of Allah and then it has been inherited by Ali’s pure progeny, whom Allah has granted faith, knowledge and wisdom as He has said, “And those who are given knowledge and faith will say: Certainly you tarried according to the ordinance of Allah till the Day of Resurrection.” The imamate has been limited to the progeny of Ali until the Day of Resurrection because there is no prophet after Muhammad . Then how can these ignorants choose the imam? Imamate is the rank of the prophets and the inheritance of their guardians. Imamate is the caliphate of Allah and His messenger and it is the position of Amirul Mo’mineen Ali and the inheritance of al-Hasan and al-Husayn . Imamate is the reins of religion, the system that runs the Muslims’ affairs, the goodness of life and the honor of the believers. Imamate is the progressive basis of Islam. With the imam prayers, zakat, fasting, hajj, jihad, finance, charities, judgements, penalties and protecting the boundaries become perfect. The imam permits what Allah has permitted and prohibits what Allah has prohibited. He defends the religion of Allah, carries out His penalties and invites to the way of his Lord with wisdom, fair exhortation and with inevitable evidence. An imam is the shining sun that spreads its light allover the world while it is in the sky where neither hands nor eyes can harm it. An imam is a luminous moon, a bright lamp, shining light and a guiding star in the dark nights, in the deserts and in the high seas. An imam is like pure water to the thirsty. He is the light leading to guidance and he is the saver, who saves from perishment. An imam is like a fire on a hill. It is warm to those, who want to warm themselves and it is a sign of guidance to the lost. Who turns away from it will perish. An imam is like raining clouds, like the shining sun, like the shady sky, like plain ground, like a flowing fountain, like a brook and a garden. An imam is like a close companion, a kind father, a good brother and a merciful mother to her child. He is a safe resort to people during disasters. An imam is the trustee of Allah among His people, His authority over them, His caliph on His earth, the advocate of His mission and the defender of His sanctuaries. An imam is purified from sins, free from defects, inspired with knowledge and endowed with discernment. He is the order of religion, the dignity of the Muslims, the rage of the hypocrites and the ruin of the unbelievers. An imam is the only one of his age. He is incomparable and with no like or substitute. He is endowed with all virtues by the Exalted Giver. Who, then, can know what an imam is to choose him? How far! Minds become confused, wise men go astray, discerning people abstain, speechers fail, intelligents ignore, poets become tired, men of letters flop and eloquent people falter to describe one aspect of an imam’s aspects or one virtue of his virtues. How can he be described as all? How can his essence be recognized? Can anything of his affairs be understood? Can anyone replace him? Certainly not! He is like a star to the hands of the catchers! So how can they choose the imam with their fancies or how can minds determine that? Is there another like? Do you think that that is available among other than the Prophet’s progeny? By Allah their minds have cheated them and their false fancies have deluded them and so they put themselves in a very high position, from which their feet will slip to the lowest bottom. They want to appoint the imam with confused or inactive minds and deviating thoughts; therefore they become too far away from him (the imam). They look forward to unattainable thing, say false thing and go astray too far and then they fall into confusion when they turn away from the imam knowingly and when the Satan has encrusted their bad deeds to them to take them away from the straight path. They turn away from the choice of Allah, His messenger and Ahlul Bayt and cling to their own choice whereas Allah has said, “And your Lord creates and chooses whom He pleases; to choose is not theirs; glory be to Allah, and exalted be He above what they associate with Him.” And it behooves not a believing man and a believing woman that they should have any choice in their matter when Allah and His Messenger have decided a matter.” And, “What has happened to you? How do you judge? Or have you a book wherein you read? That you have surely therein what you choose. Or have you received from Us an agreement confirmed by an oath extending to the Day of Resurrection that you shall surely have what you demand? Ask them which of them will vouch for that. Or have they other gods? Then let them bring their other gods if they are truthful.” سَابِقُوا إِلَىٰ مَغْفِرَةٍ مِنْ رَبِّكُمْ وَجَنَّةٍ عَرْضُهَا كَعَرْضِ السَّمَاءِ وَالْأَرْضِ أُعِدَّتْ لِلَّذِينَ آمَنُوا بِاللَّهِ وَرُسُلِهِ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ فَضْلُ اللَّهِ يُؤْتِيهِ مَنْ يَشَاءُ ۚ وَاللَّهُ ذُو الْفَضْلِ الْعَظِيمِ {21} And, “Do they not then reflect on the Qur’an? Nay, on the hearts there are locks,” or, “a seal is set on their hearts so they do not understand,” or “They said, We hear, and they did not obey. Surely the vilest of animals, in Allah’s sight, are the deaf, the dumb, who do not understand. And if Allah had known any good in them He would have made them hear, and if He makes them hear they would turn back while they withdraw,” or, “They said: We hear and disobey,” but it is “The grace of Allah: He gives it to whom He pleases.” How can they choose the imam? An imam is a savant that does not ignore and a guardian that does not wrong. He is the essence of holiness, purity, asceticism, knowledge and worship. He is appointed by the Prophet (S) via revelation. He is from the progeny of the pure Batool . There is no defect in his lineage and no one is comparable to him from among all of Quraysh. He is the summit of the Hashimites, the successor of the Prophet (S) and the pleasing of Allah. He is the most honorable of the all. He is with perfect knowledge and discernment. He undertakes the imamate devotedly. He is aware of politics. He is obeyed. He carries out the orders of Allah, directs people to their welfare and guards the religion of Allah. Allah grants the prophets and imams (peace be upon them) with His knowledge and wisdom, which He does not grant anyone else than them with. Hence their knowledge is above the knowledge of the people of every age. Allah says, “Is He then Who guides to the truth more worthy to be followed, or he who himself does not go aright unless he is guided? What then is the matter with you; how do you judge,” and, “…and whoever is granted wisdom, he indeed is given a great good.” And He says about Talut, “Surely Allah has chosen him in preference to you, and He has increased him abundantly in knowledge and physique, and Allah grants His kingdom to whom He pleases, and Allah is Ample-giving, Knowing.” And He says to His messenger Muhammad , “…and Allah has revealed to you the Book and the wisdom, and He has taught you what you did not know, and Allah’s grace on you is very great.” Allah says about the infallible imams of His prophet’s progeny, “Or do they envy the people for what Allah has given them of His grace? But indeed We have given to Ibraheem’s children the Book and the wisdom, and We have given them a grand kingdom. So of them is he who believes in him and of them is he who turns away from him, and hell is sufficient to burn.” If Allah chooses someone to run the affairs of His people, He will delight his heart to be ready to that, grant him with wisdom and inspire him with knowledge that he will never fail to answer any question. Allah assists him and makes him infallible that he does never fall into error, fault or mistake. Allah grants him with all of that to be His authority over His people. “… that is the grace of Allah: He gives it to whom He pleases, and Allah is the Lord of mighty grace.” After all, can they be fit to choose such an imam? Can their chosen imam be with all these virtues that Allah has granted to the imams, whom He has chosen? By the House of Allah, they have trespassed the truth and turned their backs to the holy Book of Allah indifferently. The Book of Allah has the remedy and the guidance but they have neglected it and followed their fancies; therefore Allah has dispraised them, detested them and has made them wretched. Allah has said, “…and who is more erring than he who follows his low desires without any guidance from Allah? Surely Allah does not guide the unjust people,” and “…for them is destruction and He has made their deeds ineffective,” and “…greatly hated is it by Allah and by-those who believe. Thus does Allah set a seal over the heart of every proud, haughty one.”"
Kitāb al-Ghayba,The Book of Occultation,,Abū ʿAbd Allah Muḥammad b. Ibrāhīm al-Nuʿmānī,Abdullah al-Shahin,"Kitāb al-Ghayba, written by al-Shaykh Muḥammad b. Ibrāhīm al-Nuʿmānī is a vital work regarding the occultation of the 12th Imam (a). This is for a variety of reasons, the first of which is considering the early authorship of this work— which seems to have been penned very shortly after the end of the minor occultation.

He has shone His divine method with them and has uncovered to them the hidden springs of His knowledge. Whoever of Muhammad’s nation knows the right of his imam will taste the sweetness of his faith and find the virtue of the comeliness of his religion. Allah has appointed the imam as a sign to His people and has made him the authority over the believers. Allah has put on the imam’s head the crown of gravity and has shed upon him some of His light. He is the means between the Heaven and people. Nothing of the blessings of Allah is gained except by the means of the imam. Allah does not accept the deeds of His people without regarding (the right of) their imam. The imam is able to answer all the vague problems and is aware of all the ambiguous issues of the Sharia and the confusing questions of religion. Allah has chosen for His people the infallible imams from the descendants of al-Husayn one after the other. He has been pleased with them and He has accepted them for His people. Whenever an imam goes to the better world, Allah appoints another as a guiding imam and a knowing authority to guide the people to the straight path of the truth. The imams are the authorities of Allah, His preachers and guardians, by whom people are guided and nations are refreshed. Allah has made them as the means of life for His people, as the light in darkness and as the pillars of Islam. All that has been determined by the will of Allah. The imams are the preferred choice of Allah, the chosen guides and expected deliverances. Allah has chosen them since the first creation. He has created them as shadows before making them as beings at the right side of His Throne with His care. He has endowed them with wisdom while in the unseen world near Him. He has created them as the pure remainder of Adam, the best of Noah’s progeny, the choice of Abraham’s family, the offspring of Ishmael and the purest progeny of Muhammad . They are still under the care of Allah and they are protected by His angels. They are protected from the evil darkness and the evil of every devil. They are freed from handicaps and diseases. They are infallible before all kinds of obscenities. They are endowed with piety and patience. They are granted with abstinence, knowledge and virtue. An imam is entrusted with the position of his father. He keeps silent during the lifetime of his father. But when the will of Allah determines to bring the father to the better world, the son becomes ready to receive the order of Allah. Allah will entrust the son after the death of the father with His religion and make him the authority over His people and the guardian on His earth. He assists him with His angels, grants him His knowledge, entrusts him with His secret, deputes him to undertake the great task, appoints him as the authority over His people, makes him as a light for the believers of His religion and entrusts him with their affairs. Allah is pleased with him as His guardian over His people. He entrusts him with His knowledge, wisdom and religion. He makes him revive His path, obligations and penalties. In his turn, the imam spreads justice when the ignorant become confused, confutes the arguers with the clear proofs and the bright truth of his truthful fathers . No one ignores this truth save the wretched, no one denies it save the deviate and no one leaves it aside save the opponents of Allah.”"

Allah says, “But none knows its interpretation except Allah and those who are firmly rooted in knowledge.”"

(شبه الفزع) فذهاب ملكهم هكذا أغفل ما كانوا عن ذهابه. وقال أمير المؤمنين على منبر الكوفة: إن الله قدر فيما قدر وقضى وحتم بأنه كائن لا بد منه أنه يأخذ بني أمية بالسيف جهرة، وأنه يأخذ بنى فلان بغتة. وقال: لا بدّ من رحى تطحن، فإذا قامت على قطبها وثبتت على ساقها بعث الله عليها عبداً عنيفاً خاملاً أصله، يكون النصر معه، أصحابه الطويلة شعورهم، أصحاب السبال، سود ثيابهم، أصحاب رايات سود، ويل لمن ناواهم، يقتلونهم هرجاً، والله لكأني أنظر إليهم وإلى أفعالهم وما يلقى الفجار منهم والأعراب الجفاة يسلطهم الله عليهم بلا رحمة، فيقتلونهم هرجاً على مدينتهم بشاطئ الفرات البرية والبحرية، جزاء بما عملوا، وما ربك بظلام للعبيد.,"(13) Ahmad bin Muhammad bin Sa’eed bin Oqda narrated from Ahmad bin Yousuf bin Ya’qoob Abul Hasan al-Ju’fi from Issma’eel bin Mihran from al-Hasan bin Ali bin Abu Hamza from his father and Wuhayb bin Hafs from Abu Baseer that Abu Ja’far al-Baqir had said: “If you see a great fire burning in the east for three days or seven days, then wait for the deliverance of Muhammad’s progeny inshallah. Allah is Mighty, Wise!” Then he said: “The cry will not occur except in the month of Ramadan because Ramadan is the month of Allah and the cry is the cry of Gabriel to the people.” Then he added: “A call will come from the Heaven with the name of al-Qa’im. It will be heard by everyone in the east and everyone in the west. The cry will make every sleeper awake, every stander sit and every sitter stand because of fright. Allah will have mercy upon whoever submits to the cry and obeys the caller because the first cry will be the cry of Gabriel ” Then he said: “The cry will be in the month of Ramadan, in a night of a Friday, which will be the twenty-third of the month. Do never doubt that. Listen and obey! At the end of the day there will be the voice of Iblis the cursed calling out: “So-and-so (Uthman) is killed unjustly” just to make people doubt and become confused. On that day much many people will doubt and become confused and then go to Hell. If you hear the call in Ramadan, do not doubt it. It will be the voice of Gabriel. The evidence is that he will call out the name of al-Qa’im and the name of his father. The call will be heard by everyone until the virgins in their veils instigate their fathers and brothers to rise (to join al-Qa’im). These two calls must occur before the appearance of al-Qa’im. One will be from the Heaven calling out the name of al-Qa’im and the name of his father. It will be the call of Gabriel. The other will be from the earth and it will be the call of Iblis calling out the name of someone claiming that he has been killed unjustly just to create sedition among people. Obey the first call and beware of being deceived by the second one!” He also said: “Al-Qa’im will not appear except after a great terror among people, earthquakes, seditions, calamities, plague, terrible killing among the Arabs, great disagreements among people, separation in the religion and bad living until one will wish to die in the morning or in the evening because of the oppression of people and their striving to eat each other. Al-Qa’im will disappear after the people will have become so desperate and hopeless to get any deliverance. How blessed is he, who lives until the appearance of al-Qa’im and becomes one of his assistants and woe unto whoever opposes him, objects to his orders and become one of his opponents.” He said: “When he (al-Qa’im) rises, he will rule with a new method, new principles, new Sunna and new judgements. He will be severe with the Arabs. He will kill great numbers of people without forgiving anyone and without caring for any blame because he will act according to the will of Allah.” He said: “If the people of the family of so-and-so disagree among themselves, then you wait for deliverance to come soon because your deliverance will not come except after their disagreement. If they disagree, then expect the cry in Ramadan and the appearance of al-Qa’im. Allah does what he wills! Al-Qa’im will not appear and you will not get what you look forward to unless those people disagree among themselves. If that occurs, people will seize the opportunity against them, separation will occur and then as-Sufyani will rise.” He said: “The family of so-and-so must rule. When they rule and disagree among themselves, their state will be separated and lost. Al-Khurasani and as-Syfyani will rise against them; this from the east and that from the west. They will compete towards Kufa as two racehorses until that family will be perished by them.” He said: “The risings of as-Sufyani, al-Yamani and al-Khurasani will be in the same year, in the same month and on the same day. They will be like the beads of a rosary; one following the other. Sufferings will be from every side. Miserable will be whoever resists them. From among the three banners, only the banner of al-Yamani will be a banner of guidance because he will invite to the mission of your man (al-Qa’im). When al-Yamani rises, he will forbid selling weapons for all of the people and for the Muslims as well. When al-Yamani rises, you are to join him because his banner will be a banner of guidance. It is not permissible for any Muslim to turn away from him and whoever does so, will be in Hell, because al-Yamani will invite to the truth and to the straight path.” He said: “The loss of the rule of the family of so-and-so will be like the breaking of pottery or like a man, who has a piece of pottery in his hand while he is walking. It falls from his hand while he is inattentive but immediately he becomes attentive to find that it is broken. So is the loss of their rule. They will be so inattentive when their state will be lost. One day Amirul Mo’mineen said from on the minbar of Kufa: “Allah has determined that it is inevitable for the Umayyads to be killed by the sword openly and for the family of so-and-so to be defeated unexpectedly.” He said: “There must be grinding querns. When they (the querns) begin to turn around their axis, Allah will send a severe man, whose mention is obscure, against them. Victory will be always with him. His companions will be longhair and with long moustaches. Their cloths will be black and their banners will be black too. Woe unto whoever opposes them. They will kill their opponents excitedly. By Allah, as if I see them, their actions and what distresses the dissolute and the rude nomads will get from them! Allah will make them defeat those rude people with no mercy. They will kill them in their city at the shore of the Euphrates as a reward to what they have committed…and Allah is not in the least unjust to the servants!”"

I do not think that you live until then but narrate this from me after my death. Other signs are a call from the Heaven, a cry comes from the direction of Damascus, one of the villages of Sham called al-Jabiya sinks, a part of the mosque of Damascus falls down, a group of the Turks apostates and then commotion in Rome. The Turks come and occupy the island whereas the Romans come to settle in ar-Ramla. O Jabir, that year will be full of events everywhere from the direction of the west. The first country that will be ruined is Sham. Then people will disagree and divide into three armies; the army of the reddish one, the army of the spotted one and the army of as-Sufyani. As-Sufyani will fight the spotted one and he will kill him with his followers and then he will fight the reddish one and he will kill him. Then he will move towards Iraq. He will pass by Qarqeesiya’. A fight will break out. As-Sufyani will kill about one hundred thousands of the arrogants. Then he will send an army of seventy thousand warriors towards Kufa. They will kill, crucify and capture many of the people of Kufa. While they are doing so, an army will come from the direction of Khurasan. With this army there will be some companions of al-Qa’im. A faithful man from Kufa with weak followers will revolt but he will be killed by the leader of as-Sufyani’s army between Kufa and Heera. As-Sufyani will send a troop to Medina. Al-Mahdi will flee from Medina to Mecca. The leader of the army will be informed that al-Mahdi has gone to Mecca so he will send a troop to follow after him but with no use. Al-Mahdi will enter Mecca frightfully and cautiously like Prophet Moses . The army of as-Sufyani will stop in the desert. A caller from the Heaven will call out: “O desert, destroy these people!” The desert will sink with the army and none of them will escape death except three persons, whom Allah will turn their faces towards their backs. It is about them that this verse has been revealed, ‘O you who have been given the Book! believe that which We have revealed, verifying what you have, before We alter faces then turn them on their backs.’ On that day al-Qa’im will be in Mecca leaning his back against the Kaaba. He will announce: “O people, we resort to Allah to make us succeed. Whoever of you wants to support us, let him join us. We are the progeny of your Prophet Muhammad . We are worthier of Allah and Muhammad than other people. Whoever argues with me about Adam, I am the worthiest of Adam. Whoever argues with me about Noah, I am the worthiest of Noah. Whoever argues with me about Abraham, I am the worthiest of Abraham. Whoever argues with me about Muhammad , I am the worthiest of Muhammad . Whoever argues with me about the prophets, I am the worthiest of the prophets. Has Allah not said in his Book, ‘Surely Allah chose Adam and Noah and the descendants of Abraham and the descendants of Imran above the nations; offspring one of the other; and Allah is Hearing, Knowing?’ I am a remainder of Adam, a relic of Noah, elite of Abraham and a choice of Muhammad, peace be upon them all. Whoever argues with me about the Book of Allah, I am the worthiest of the book of Allah. Whoever argues with me about the Sunna of the messenger of Allah, I am the worthiest of the Sunna of the messenger of Allah. I adjure everyone, who hears my speech today, to inform the absent of it. I ask you with the right of Allah, the right of His messenger and with my right, for I have a right of kinship to the messenger of Allah, to support us and to protect us from those, who have wronged us. We have been wronged, offended, expelled from our homes, separated from our families, deprived of our rights and our honor and virtues have been distorted by the evil people. For the sake of Allah, do not fail us. Support us that may Allah supports you!” Allah will make his (al-Mahdi’s) three hundred and thirteen companions join him without any previous appointment. O Jabir, it is the verse that Allah has revealed in His Book, ‘Wherever you are, Allah will bring you all together; surely Allah has power over all things.’ People will pay homage to him between the corner (of the Kaaba) and the temple (of Abraham). With him there will be a covenant from the Prophet (S) that has been inherited by the descendants; one after the other. O Jabir, al-Qa’im is one of al-Husayn’s descendants. Allah will make him succeed within a night. O Jabir, if people doubt all that, let them not doubt his descending from the Prophet (S) and his inheriting knowledge from the ulama (the infallible imams) one after the other. If all these things become confusing to them, then the call that will come from the Heaven and will call out his name and his parents’ names certainly will not be confusing to them at all.”"

It has been said to them: “We hope that al-Qa’im appears without being preceded by the rising of as-Sufyani.” They said: “By Allah it is inevitable and it must occur.” They have confirmed that the five signs will be the greatest evidences, after which al-Qa’im will appear. They have denied timing and said: “Whoever narrates from us traditions talking about timing, do not hesitate in considering him as a liar whoever he is because we do not time.” This is clear evidence showing the falseness of whoever claims that he is al-Qa’im before the occurrence of these signs."

Prophet Noah planted the stone and told his companions of that. The palm grew and fruited. He ate from its fruit and made his companions eat from it. His companions said to him: “O prophet of Allah, what about the promise that you have promised us of?” Prophet Noah prayed Allah to carry out the promise that He had made. Allah revealed to him to plant another stone and when it grew and fruited, Allah would torment them. Noah told his companions about that. They divided into three groups. One group apostatized, the other dissembled and the third one still kept to Noah . Prophet Noah planted a stone again. It grew and fruited. He ate from its fruit and fed his companions. They said: “O prophet of Allah, what about the promise that you have made?” He prayed Allah. Allah revealed to him to plant a third stone and if it grew, fruited and he ate from its fruit, then Allah would perish his people. Noah told his companions of that. The two groups (the hypocrites and the believers) divided into three groups; one apostatized, one dissembled and the third still kept to Noah . Prophet Noah did that ten times and his companions divided every time into three groups. In the tenth time some of his sincere companions came to him and said: “O prophet of Allah, whether you do what you have promised or you do not do, you are truthful. You are a prophet sent by Allah and we never doubt you whatever you do to us.” In this way Allah perished the people of Noah except the loyal companions, who kept to Noah . Noah and his sincere followers rode on the Ark and so Allah saved them after they had been tried, sifted and cleared."

Before the appearance of al-Qa’im there must be two plagues; the white plague and the red plague.” I said: “What are they?” He said: “The white plague is a torrential death and the red plague is killing by the sword. Al-Qa’im does not appear until his name will be called out from the Heaven in the twenty-third night of Ramadan, which will be a night of Friday.” I said: “What will be called out?” He said: “The caller will call out the name of al-Qa’im and the name of his father and will say: “So-and-so the son of so-and-so is al-Qa’im of Muhammad’s progeny. You are to listen to him and to obey him.” Every alive thing of the creatures will hear the call. The sleepers will awake and get out to courtyards and the virgins will get out of their veils.

As for the banner of aal Ja’far, it will begin with nothing (important) and will end to nothing.” I became angry on hearing that. I said to him: “May I die for you! Will there be banners before yours?” He said: “Yes, there will. By Allah, aal Mardas will have a strong rule but with no goodness. Their state will be full of difficulties but with no easiness. They will bring the foreigners closer and will remove the near. When they feel that they are safe from the punishment of Allah and that their state does never decline, a cry will come upon them and then no ruler will remain to gather them, no one to listen to them and no people to support them. Allah has given an example in His Book when saying, ‘Until when the earth puts on its golden raiment and it becomes garnished, and its people think that they have power over it, Our command comes to it, by night or by day.” Then Muhammad bin al-Hanafiyya swore by Allah that this verse had been revealed concerning those people. I said to him: “May I die for you! You have told about a great thing concerning those people, then when will they perish?” He said: “O Muhammad (bin Bishr), Allah reverses the timing of the diviners. Prophet Moses promised his people (that Allah would do away with their enemy) after thirty days but Allah had determined further ten days and He had not told Prophet Moses of that. When the appointment of the promise passed, the people of Moses disbelieved and began to worship the calf. Prophet Younus (Jonah) warned his people that they would be tortured but Allah had willed to forgive them but without informing Prophet Younus of that and then happened what had happened to them. When you see neediness spread and one says that he has spent his night without eating anything and when one receives you in a manner and the other day he receives you in a different manner then you expect it!” I said: “I know what neediness is. What is the other thing?” He said: “It is when one meets you smilingly but when you go to borrow something from him, he will meet you in a different manner. Then the cry (from the Heaven) will occur somehow soon.”"

Although he is sinful but you will be safe for a month or two after his rising until he kills much many people other than you.” Some of his companions said: “What about our families if that occurs?” He said: “Men are to hide from him (as-Sufyani). His rage is against our followers and women will be safe inshallah.” It was said to him: “Whereto do men escape from him?” He said: “Whoever wants to get away is to go to Medina or Mecca or other countries.” Then he said: “But what do you do in Medina?!

Gabriel will be the first one, who pays homage to al-Qa’im and then the three hundred and thirteen companions will pay homage. Those (of al-Qa’im’s companions), who are to walk, will arrive in time and those, who are not to walk, will disappear from their beds. It is the saying of Allah, ‘Therefore hasten to (do) good works; wherever you are, Allah will bring you all together.’ The good work is the belief in the guardianship of Ahlul Bayt.”"

(قال فيض) فبكيت سروراً، ثم قلت له: يا سيدي زدني. فقال: إن أبي كان إذا أراد سفراً وأنا معه فنعس وكان هو على راحلته أدنيت راحلتي من راحلته فوسّدته ذراعي الميل والميلين حتى يقضي وطره من النوم، وكذلك يصنع بي ولدي هذا. فقلت له: زدني جعلت فداك. فقال: يا فيض، إني لأجد بابني هذا ما كان يعقوب يجده بيوسف. فقلت: سيدي زدني. فقال: هو صاحبك الذي سألتَ عنه، قم فأقرّ له بحقه. فقمت حتى قبّلت يده ورأسه ودعوت الله له. فقال أبو عبد الله: أما إنه لم يؤذن لي في المرة الأولى منك. فقلت: جعلت فداك، أخبر به عنك؟ قال: نعم، أهلك وولدك ورفقاءك. وكان معي أهلى وولدي، وكان معي يونس بن ظبيان من رفقائي، فلما أخبرتهم حمدوا الله على ذلك، وقال يونس: لا والله، حتى أسمع ذلك منه، وكانت به عجلة، فخرج فأتبعته فلما انتهيت إلى الباب سمعتُ أبا عبد الله يقول - وقد سبقنا -: يونس! الأمر كما قال لك فيض. اسكت واقبل. فقال: سمعت وأطعت. ثم دخلت، فقال لي أبو عبد الله حين دخلت: يا فيض زرقه زرقه. قلت: قد فعلت.,"(2) Muhammad bin Hammam narrated from Hameed bin Ziyad from al-Hasan bin Muhammad bin Suma’a from Ahmad bin al-Hasan al-Maythami from Abu Nujayh al-Masma’iy that al-Faydh bin al-Mukhtar had said: “I said to Abu Abdullah as-Sadiq : “What do you say about a piece of land that I take from the ruler and then I hire it and take a half or a third or less or more than that from its products? Is that permissible?” He said: “Yes, it is.” His son Issma’eel said: “O father, you have not memorized well.” Abu Abdullah as-Sadiq said to his son: “Have I dealt with such a matter differently? O my son, it is for this that I often say to you to keep to me but you do not do.” Issma’eel got up and left. I said: “May I die for you! No blame is on Issma’eel if you are going to inform him of every thing before your death (to be the imam after you) as you have been informed of every thing by your father!” He said: “O Faydh, Issma’eel to me is not as I have been to my father (concerning the imamate).” I said: “May I die for you! I have never doubted that he will be the imam after you. If what we fear (your death) occurs, then to whom we resort?” He kept silent and turned aside from me. I kissed his knee and said to him: “Be merciful to my old age! It is Hell that I fear. By Allah, if I know that I die before you, I will never mind but I fear that I live after you.” He said to me: “Stay here!” He went behind a curtain in some place in the house. He stayed for a while and then called: “O Faydh, come in!” I went in. I found him in his place of praying. He had offered prayer and then turned away from the qibla. I sat before him. His son Abul Hasan Musa , who was a young boy then, came in. He had a stick in his hand. His father seated him on his thigh and said to him: “May I die for you! What is this stick in your hand?” He said: “I passed by my brother Ali and found him beating an animal with this stick. I took it out of his hand.” Then Abu Abdullah as-Sadiq said to me: “O Faydh, Prophet Muhammad has been entrusted with the scriptures of Abraham and Moses and he has entrusted Ali with them. Then Ali has entrusted al-Hasan with them, al-Hasan has entrusted al-Husayn with them, al-Husayn has entrusted his son Ali with them, Ali bin al-Husayn has entrusted his son Muhammad with them and then my father (Muhammad bin Ali al-Baqir) has entrusted me with them. They have been with me and I have entrusted my son, this, with them even though he is still too young. They are with him now.” I understood what he wanted to say. I said to him: “May I die for you! Tell me more please!” He said: “O Faydh, whenever my father wanted Allah to respond to his praying, he seated me beside him on his right hand. He prayed Allah and I said: “Amen!” Now I do the same with my son.” I cried because of delight and said to him: “O my master, tell me more please!” He said: “When my father traveled and I was with him, I approached my sumpter near to his if he felt sleepy to put my arm under his head for a mile or two until he somehow took his need of sleep. Now my son, this, does the same to me.” I said: “Tell me more please! May I die for you!” He said: “O Faydh, I see in this son as Prophet Jacob has seen in his son Joseph .” I said: “Tell me more please, O my master!” He said: “He is your man (the imam after me), whom you have asked about. Get up and confess his right!” I got up and kissed his hand and head. I prayed Allah to protect him. Abu Abdullah as-Sadiq said: “In the first time I was not permitted to inform you.” I said: “May I narrate this from you?” He said: “Yes, you may narrate it to your wife and children and to your companions.” My wife and children were with me and of my companions was Younus bin Dhabyan. When I told them of that, they praised Allah too much. Younus said: “By Allah, I shall not be satisfied until I hear this from him himself.” He left hastily. I followed after him. When I arrived at the door, I heard Abu Abdullah as-Sadiq saying to Younus: “It is as Faydh has told you. Keep silent and accept that from him!” Younus said: “I listen and obey.” I came in. Abu Abdullah as-Sadiq said to me: “O Faydh, make him your companion!” I said: “I have done.”"

On his right side there was the master of his sons Musa (al-Kadhim) and before him there was a covered coffin. He said to me: “O Zurara, send for Dawood bin Katheer, Hamran and Abu Baseer to come.” Then al-Mufadhdhal bin Umar came in. I left to bring those persons. People began to come one after the other until we became about thirty men inside the house. When the house became crowded, Abu Abdullah as-Sadiq said: “O Dawood, uncover the face of Issma’eel!” Dawood uncovered Issma’eel’s face. Abu Abdullah as-Sadiq said: “O Dawood, is he alive or dead?” Dawood said: “O my master, he is dead.” Abu Abdullah as-Sadiq asked everyone in the house the same question after showing them the dead body of his son and all of them answered that he was dead. Then he said: “O Allah, witness!” He ordered to wash the dead (according to the Islamic rituals) and to put him into his last clothing. When everything was finished, Abu Abdullah as-Sadiq said to al-Mufadhdhal: “O Mufadhdhal, uncover his face!” Al-Mufadhdhal did. Abu Abdullah as-Sadiq said to him: “Is he alive or dead?” He said: “He is dead.” Abu Abdullah as-Sadiq said: “O Allah, be the witness over them!” Then Issma’eel was carried to his grave. When he was put into the grave, Abu Abdullah as-Sadiq said: “O Mufadhdhal, uncover his face!” He asked the all: “Is he alive or dead?” We said: “He is dead.” He said: “O Allah, witness and you, O people witness because those, who follow falsehood, will doubt. They want to put out the light of Allah with their mouths-he pointed to his son Musa-and Allah will not consent save to perfect His light.” Then we began to pour soil over the dead. He asked us again: “Who is the dead buried inside this grave?” We said: “He is Issma’eel.” He said: “O Allah, witness!” Then he held the hand of his son Musa and said: “He (al-Qa’im) is a truth and the truth is from him until Allah inherits the earth and all there is on it.” I have found this tradition with somone of our companions, who said that he had written it from Abul Murajja bin Muhammad al-Ghamr at-Taghlubi and he mentioned that Abu Sahl had narrated it to him from Abul Faraj the clerk of Bundar al-Qommi from Bundar from Muhammad bin Sadaqa and Muhammad bin Amr from Zurara. Abu al-Murajja mentioned that he had shown this tradition to some of his companions, who had said that al-Hasan bin al-Munthir had narrated it to him from Zurara and added that Abu Abdullah as-Sadiq had said: “By Allah, your man will appear to you and he will not have had any homage to anyone at all.” And he said: Your man will not appear until the people of truth will suspect him. “Say: It is a message of importance.
