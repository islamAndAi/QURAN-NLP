Thawāb al-Aʿmāl wa ʿIqāb al-Aʿmāl delineates virtuous and sinful deeds, elucidating their spiritual consequences which lead to either reward or punishment. It has long served as an invaluable resource for both Shīʿa scholars and the general Shīʿa population and is celebrated as one of the most notable Shīʿa Ḥadīth collections.

In the name of God, most Gracious, most Compassionate Praise be to Allah the One, the Eternal and the Ever living. One Whose limits and ends could not be imagined. Neither slumber overtakes Him nor sleep, the One Whose existence has no beginning and no end. He proves His existence for His creatures and for the birth of His creatures upon His eternal nature and He is needful of comparison with something in order that the creatures may be guided to Him. His signs are witnesses for His power. His being cannot be described and visions cannot perceive Him and thoughts cannot reach upto His being. He is such that nothing is like him and He is the hearer and seer. And I testify that there is no God except Allah the One without any partner. He has promised His rewards for His obedience and His punishment for His disobedience. And I testify that Muhammad (s.a.w.s) is His servant and His Messenger. He sent him with the illuminated and clear book and assured that falsehood will not approach it from front or back. It is the revelation of the Wise and the Praised Lord. And I testify that Amirul Momineen Ali Ibne Abi Talib and the Purified Imams from his progeny are the Proofs of Allah upon His creatures after the conclusion of revelations. And I testify that their partisans (Shias) and their devotees who follow their practice and manners are on the straight path and they are the true believers and one who opposes them and leaves their path and abandons their commands and does not follow their practice has deviated from the straight path and gone astray from the way. I beseech Allah that He makes us firm on their religion, their devotion and their love and not make our hearts deviated after being guided. And that He bestows us with His bestowals, indeed He is the best of the Givers. Says Ash-Shaykh Abu Ja’far Muhammad bin Ali bin alHusain bin Musa bin Babawahy al-Qummi (r.a): That which led me to write this book was the saying of the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s): “One who reminds (people) to do good deeds is like one who performs them himself.” I have titled this book as “Thawaabul A’amaal” and I implore the Almighty not to keep me deprived of its rewards. I have not desired anything by writing it except rewards of Almighty and to achieve His pleasure, glorified be He. And I do not intend by it anything else. And there is no power and strength except for Allah. And He is sufficient for us and the best of the trustees."

Imam Muhammad Baqir narrates from his father that a person asked the reward of remaining awake at night and reciting the Holy Quran to Amirul Momineen . Amirul Momineen replied, “There are glad tidings for him. One who offers Salaat in one-tenth part of night seeking reward from Allah, the Almighty Allah says to His angels, ‘Note down the good deeds for this servant of Mine equal to the number of all the grains, leaves, trees and meadows’. One who offers Salaat for one-ninth part of night Allah grants him ten recommended supplications and hands over his scroll of deeds on the Day of Judgment in his right hand. One who offers Salaat for one-eighth part of night Almighty Allah grants him the reward of a martyr who was patient and had pure intention and Almighty Allah would also accept his intercession. One who offers Salaat for one- seventh part of night he would come out of his grave in such a state that his face would be shinning like a full moon and he would pass on the Sirat Bridge along with the protecte ones of Allah. One who offers Salaat for one-sixth part of night would be counted among those who repent and his sins committed in past and future would be forgiven. One who spends one-fifth part of night offering Salaat would get a place in Maqbara-e-Ibrahim . One who offers Salaat for one-fourth part of night would be considered first among the successful people for he would pass through the Sirat Bridge like a strong wind and enter Paradise without accounting of his deeds. One who offers Salaat for one-third part of night every angel whom he will meet will say to him, ‘I wish even my position would have been so near to Allah like yours’. That person would be given the choice of entering Paradise through any of the eight doors. One who offers Salaat for half part of night giving him whole earth filled with gold seventy thousand times would not be sufficient as his reward. The reward of this deed is more than that of freeing seventy slaves from the progeny of Ismail . One who prays for two-third part of a night would be given rewards equal to the number of grains of sand on earth and the weight of smallest deed would be equal to that of Mt. Ohad. One who involves himself in Salaat, Ruku and recitation of the Holy Quran he would be given a great reward. The smallest reward given to him is that he would be cleansed of his sins as he was on the day he was born. He would be given rewards and positions equal to the number of all creatures of Allah. His grave would remain illuminated forever. Sins and jealousy would be removed from his heart. He would be given salvation from the chastisement of grave. He would be given freedom from Hell. All those who were in his protection would be resurrected along with him. The Almighty Allah will say to the angels, ‘O My angels! See this servant of Mine. He used to remain awake at night for the sake of My pleasure. Give him peace in Paradise. There are a hundred thousand cities in Paradise for him and all of them have all the things required to satisfy the desires of the eyes and the hunger of one’s heart. You won’t believe that I am going to give him more honor and proximity to Myself’.”"

Imam Ja’far Sadiq narrates from his predecessors that the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) said, “Whenever a pilgrim intends to go for a Hajj, Allah writes ten rewards for him, wipes his ten sins and increases his position by ten levels even before he has bought a single thing for his journey. When he intends to board the vehicle, Allah gives him the above mentioned reward even before he has set his foot on it. When he performs the circumambulation of the House of Allah his sins are wiped off. When he performs Saee between Safa and Marwa, he becomes pure of his sins. When he halts at Arafah, his sins vanish. When he camps in Mashar he comes out of his sins. When he performs stoning at Jimaraat, all his sins are wiped off. Similarly, the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) narrated all the acts of Hajj and said that all these acts wipe the sins of a person. Then he said, “How can you reach the position of a Hajj pilgrim?”"

Allah, the Mighty and Sublime would note seventy thousand rewards for him, wipe his seventy thousand sins, increase his position seventy thousand levels, fulfill his seventy thousand wishes and grant him the reward of freeing seventy thousand slaves each costing ten thousand dirhams.”"

One who observes one fast in Rajab, Hell would go away from him to a distance of a year and Paradise would be made obligatory on one who fasts for three days.”"
Thawāb al-Aʿmāl wa ʿiqāb al-Aʿmāl,The Rewards & Punishments of Deeds,,Shaykh Muḥammad b. ʿAlī al-Ṣaduq,Sayed Athar Husain Rizvi & Sayed Maqsood Athar,"Thawāb al-Aʿmāl wa ʿIqāb al-Aʿmāl is a remarkable collection of Ḥadīths collected by al-Shaykh al-Ṣadūq, a preeminent Shīʿa scholar of the 4th/10th century. Thawāb al-Aʿmāl wa ʿIqāb al-Aʿmāl delineates virtuous and sinful deeds, elucidating their spiritual consequences which lead to either reward or punishment. It has long served as an invaluable resource for both Shīʿa scholars and the general Shīʿa population and is celebrated as one of the most notable Shīʿa Ḥadīth collections. The author's motivation for writing this book was rooted in the prophetic hadith: ""The one who leads people to good deeds is as their doer."" Shaykh al-Ṣadūq emphasised that his primary goal in authoring the book was to seek the reward and satisfaction of God. The book is structured into two primary parts. The first part, ""Thawāb al-Aʿmāl,"" encompasses 788 Ḥadīths arranged under 389 titles, detailing the spiritual rewards for performing righteous actions. The second part, ""ʿIqāb al-Aʿmāl,"" includes 331 Ḥadīths distributed under 131 titles, focusing on the punitive consequences of committing sinful actions.",2 | Rewards,Chapter 128 | Reward of fast of

أَهْلٌ.,"4. The Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) says, “Know that Rajab is a great month of Allah. It is called Asam because there is no month so dear and excellent for Allah except this. It was respected even during the time of ignorance. When Islam arrived, it too increased the greatness and excellence of this month. Know that Rajab is the month of Allah, Shaban is my month and Ramadan is the month of my Ummah. Know that if a faithful person fasts seeking reward from Allah he has gained lots of pleasure of Allah. The fast of that person would end the anger of Allah upon him; a door of Hell would be closed for him. The reward of this fast with pure intention is better than giving an earth filled with gold as charity. No object in this world can make his reward complete except good deeds. As soon as night falls, Allah would fulfill his ten wishes. If he prays for worldly life his prayers would be accepted. One who prays for His friends, lovers and chosen people, Allah would accept his prayers. One who observes two fasts in the month of Rajab nothing in the earth and heavens can imagine the greatness of that person. He would get the reward of a truthful person who has never lied in his whole life-time. He would appear on the Day of Judgment in the similar state. That person would do intercession of others along with other truthful people till they all enter Paradise and settle down with those truthful persons. One who fasts for three days in Rajab, Allah would erect a barrier between him and Hell whose distance would be equal to travel of seventy years. Allah would say at the time of Iftar, ‘You have right upon Me and My love for you has become obligatory. O angels! I hold you witness that I have forgiven his sins from start till the end’. One who fasts for four days in the month of Rajab, he will remain safe from calamities like the evils of Jinns, leprosy, leucoderma, mischief of Dajjal and the punishment of grave. He would get the reward of wise persons who repent. He would be handed over the scroll of deeds in his right hand and made to stand in the first row of worshippers. One who fasts for five days in the month of Rajab it is the duty of Allah to please him on the Day of Judgment. His face would be shinning like the full moon when he is resurrected on the Day of Judgment. Rewards equal to the number of grains of sand would be written for him and he would be made to enter Paradise without any accounting. He would be given choice to ask whatever he wants from Allah. One who fasts for six days in the month of Rajab, his face would be brighter than sun when he is resurrected on the Day of Judgment. Apart from this, he would be given extra light, which would light up all those gathered on that day. He would be gathered along with protected people and would pass through the Sirat Bridge without any accounting. His sins as great as disobeying parents and breaking relations will be forgiven. One who fasts for seven days in the month of Rajab, Allah would close all seven doors of Hell for him and prohibit the fire of Hell for his body. One who fasts for eight days in the month of Rajab, Allah would open all eight doors of Paradise for him one by one and he would be given choice to enter Paradise from whichever door he wishes. One who fasts for nine days in Rajab would come out of his grave saying Laa ilaaha illallaah and would not see anything except Paradise. The light of his face would brighten the people gathered on that day and people would think of him as a prophet. The minimum reward given to him at that time is entrance to Paradise without any accounts. One who fasts for ten days in Rajab would be given two emerald wings decorated by illuminating pearls and rubies. He would enter Paradise flying over the Sirat Bridge with the help of these wings. He would be counted among the just and dear ones of Allah. He is like one who prayed for a hundred years with the pure intention of seeking reward from Allah. One who fasts for eleven days in Rajab, there would be no one greater in front of Allah than him except one who has fasted more than him. One who fasts for twelve days in Rajab would be made to wear two dresses of brocade and silk. If one of those dresses is brought to this world it would illuminate the world from east to west and scent the world with fragrance better than musk. One who observes thirteen fasts in Rajab, a table would be spread under the shade of the Divine throne and a number of eatables would be laid on it for him. The span of this table would be seventy times the area of this earth. Trays made of brocade and rubies will be laid on it. Every tray would have seventy thousand types of eatables each having distinct aroma and color. That person would have food from this table while others would be involved in a great difficulty. One who fasts for fourteen days in Rajab, Allah would grant him huge palaces made of pearls and rubies of such kind that eyes have neither seen nor ears heard about nor can a human mind imagine them. One who fasts for fifteen days in Rajab would stand at the place of faithful people. Every angel, messenger and apostle passing by him would say, ‘Congratulations, for you are in peace, near to Allah, honest, fortunate and happy and would rest in gardens’. One who fasts for sixteen days in Rajab would be among those who are first to ride upon the vehicles of bright light. He would fly from Paradise to the door of Mercy in these vehicles. One who observes seventeen fasts in Rajab, seventy thousand lamps would be illuminated for him at the Sirat Bridge so that he enters Paradise passing the bridge in the light of these lamps. Angels would welcome him saying, ‘Well done’ and ‘Peace be upon you’. One who fasts for eighteen days in Rajab would be given a place on the thrones made of pearls and rubies in the Minaret of Ibrahim in Paradise. One who fasts for nineteen days in the month of Rajab, Almighty Allah would construct a palace of pearls for him facing the palaces of Adam and Ibrahim . He would salute them and they too would salute him and respect his position. He would be given the reward of a thousand fasts for each fast. One who observes fast for twenty days in Rajab it is as if he has worshipped Allah for a thousand years. One who fasts for twenty-one days in Rajab, on the Day of Judgment he would get to intercede for people numbering the sinners of Rabi and Mudhir tribes. One who fasts for twenty-two days in Rajab a caller would give call from heaven, ‘O friend of Allah! There are glad- tidings for you. There is great honor for you in Allah’s eyes. You are friend of prophets, truthful ones, martyrs and the virtuous upon whom Allah has revealed His bounties and mercy. They are your best friends’. One who fasts for twenty-three days in Rajab a call would be given from heaven, ‘O slave of Allah! You are fortunate. You have taken less pain and you are getting much more benefit. The veil is taken off from you. You are rewarded greatly by your Lord. You will be a neighbor of Khaleel (Prophet Ibrahim) in Darus Salaam. One who observes fast for twenty-four days in Rajab the Angel of death would come to him in the form of a handsome youth wearing a green brocade dress mounted on a green horse of Paradise. He would be holding a golden cup decorated with a green silk more fragrant than musk filled with the pure wine of Paradise. He would make that person drink that wine while taking his soul away. The difficulties at death-bed would be eased for him and his soul would be wrapped in green silk. Such a sweet fragrance would come out if it that all the inhabitants of seven heavens would be scented with it. He would remain satisfied in his grave as well as when he would be resurrected until he reaches the cistern of the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.). One who fasts for twenty-five days in Rajab would be surrounded by seventy thousand angels, each holding an umbrella made of pearls and rubies when he is resurrected from the grave. They would have ornaments and excellent dresses. They would say, ‘O dear one of Allah! Let us go to Him soon’. Then he would go to Paradise first along with the dear ones of Allah. Indeed it is a great success. One who fasts for twenty-six days in Rajab the Almighty Allah would build a hundred palaces of pearls and rubies under the shade of His throne. There would be a tent made of red silk of Paradise in front of each palace. While people would be busy in accounting of their deeds, this person would rest over here peacefully. One who observes fast for twenty- seven days in Rajab, the Almighty Allah will expand his grave to the distance covered in four hundred years and the whole area would be fragranced with Amber and Musk. One who fasts for twenty-eight days in Rajab Allah would create a distance of nine barriers between him and the fire of Hell. The width of each barrier is equal to the distance covered in five hundred years between the earth and heaven. For a person who fasts for twenty-nine days in Rajab Allah would forgive him even if he would have robbed every man on the order of an unjust or even if she is a woman who has been unchaste seventy times. One who fasts for thirty days in the month of Rajab a caller would call out, ‘O slave of Allah! Your past sins are forgiven. Your deeds can have a new beginning’. Allah would grant him all the gardens and every garden would have forty thousand cities. Every city would have forty palaces and every palace would have forty thousand houses and every house will have forty thousand dining tables and every dining table would have forty thousand dishes and every dish would have forty thousand types of cuisines each having a distinct color and aroma. Every house will have forty thousand golden thrones and the span of those thrones would be equal to two thousand hands. A virgin Hoorul Ein would be seated on each throne having three hundred thousand dazzling hair on their heads and each lock of hair would be held by one thousand slave-girls who will be scenting it with musk and amber so that the person who fasted during Rajab comes near her. All this is for the person who fasted for the whole month of Rajab.” Someone asked, “O Messenger of Allah! What should a person do who is not able to observe fast for the whole month due to weakness, menstruation or some other reason?” The Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) said, “They should give food to poor as charity. I swear by Him in Whose control is my life that they would get much more than what I have said if they give charity daily. All the creatures of this earth and the heavens cannot even estimate one-tenth of the reward, which that person would get in Paradise.” Someone asked, “O Messenger of Allah! What should a person do who is not able to pay charity also?” The Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) said, “He should recite the following Tasbeeh of Allah a hundred times daily for thirty days in the month of Rajab: ‘Sub-h’aanal ilaahil jaleeli sub-h’aana mallaa yambaghit tasbeeh’u illaa lahu sub-h’aanal a-a’zzil akrami sub-h’aana mallabisal i’zza wahuwa lahu ahl’."

Hence observing fast on this day has reward equal to fasting seventy years.” Saad bin Abdullah says that according to our elders, there is a mistake and the real saying is that Allah appointed him as apostle when three nights were left in the month of Rajab."

Jubayr from Ibn ’Amir who said: “One who fasts for one day in Shaban, Allah writes from him seventy rewards and each reward will be equal to that of worshipping Allah for a year. One who fasts for two days, He would save him from those sins, which destroy a person. One who fasts for three days, his position in Paradise would increased by seventy levels with pearls and rubies. One who fasts for four days in Paradise his earnings would increase greatly. One who fasts for five days would be loved by the people.

One who fasts for eleven days his grave would be lit up by eleven minarets of light. One who fasts for twelve days seventy thousand angels would visit his grave every day till the Day of Judgment. One who fasts for thirteen days angels of all seven heavens would repent for him. One who fasts for fourteen days all the terrestrial and aquatic animals will be ordered to seek forgiveness for him. One who fasts for fifteen days, the Almighty Allah calls out, ‘I assure you by My Honor that I won’t burn you in the fire of Hell’. One who fasts for sixteen days, seventy rivers of fire will be extinguished for him. One who fasts for seventeen days all the doors of Hell would be closed for him. One who fasts for eighteen days in Shaban all the doors of Paradise would be opened for him. One who fasts for nineteen days would be given seventy thousand palaces made of pearls and rubies in Paradise. One who fasts for twenty days would be married to seventy thousand Hoorul Ein. One who fasts for twenty-one, days angels would congratulate him and keep moving their wings on his body. One who fasts for twenty-two days would be made to wear seventy thousand dresses made of satin and brocade. One who fasts for twenty-three days would be made to sit on a bright mount and roam throughout Paradise. One who fasts for twenty-four days would intercede for seventy thousand people who believed in the Oneness of Allah. One who fasts for twenty-five days hypocrisy would be kept away from him. One who fasts for twenty-six days Allah would give him permit to pass through the Sirat Bridge. One who fasts for twenty-seven days Allah orders to give him freedom from Hell. One who fasts for twenty-eight days his face would be illuminated and light would emanate from his face. One who fasts for twenty-nine days Almighty Allah would please him. One who fasts for thirty days in Shaban Jibraeel would stand in front of Divine throne and call out, ‘O person! Your deeds have a new beginning for your pasts sins have been forgiven’. The Almighty Allah would say, ‘I would forgive you even if the number of your sins is equal to the number of stars in the skies, or drops of rain, or leaves of trees, or grains of sand, or drops of dew or number of days of the world. This reward and forgiveness for fasting in the month of Shaban is not much for Allah.” Ibne Abbas says that this reward is for the month of Shaban only."

Ramadan is an excellent month. It was also called the al-Marzooq (a month in which bounties are given) during the time of the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.).”"

The narrator asked Imam Muhammad Baqir , “Allah says, ‘Surely We revealed it (Quran) on a blessed night’,so which is that blessed night?” Imam replied, “It is the night of Qadr (power), which is one of the last ten nights of the month of Ramadan. The Holy Quran was revealed in the night of Qadr only. Allah, the Mighty and Sublime says, ‘The fate of everything would be decided by the Divine order in this night’. All the good and bad, obedience and disobedience, birth and death, earnings etc. are decided by the Will of Allah for the whole year in this night only.” The narrator asked, “What is the meaning of verse: ‘The grand night is better than a thousand months’?” Imam replied, “The reward of good deeds performed in this night is better than that of doing the same for a thousand months without the night of Qadr. If the Almighty Allah wouldn’t have multiplied the reward for a believer they wouldn’t have got it but He multiplies the reward for them.”"

I have heard the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) say, ‘If you had known the reward in the month of Ramadan you would have thanked Allah much more. The Almighty Allah wipes out all the apparent and hidden sins of the people of my Ummah on the first night of Ramadan and increases the position of people by two hundred thousand levels and builds fifty cities in Paradise for them. He grants the reward of worship of one year, the reward of a prophet and the reward of fasting of one year for each step taken on the next day.” “On the third day, domes decorated with pearls and rubies are made in Paradise for you equaling the number of hair on your body. There will be twelve thousand illuminated houses in it – below and above. There will be twelve thousand beds in each house and a Hoor would be seated on each bed. One thousand Angels would come to you with gifts daily. The Almighty Allah would grant you seventy thousand palaces in Paradise on the fourth day.

He would note down the reward of four Hajjs performed along with the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) and reward of four Umrahs performed by a martyr or a truthful person. The twelfth day would convert your sins to good deeds, double your good deeds and further multiply them a hundred thousand times.

On the fourteenth day, you would be offered the reward of meeting Adam, Nuh, Ibrahim, Musa, Dawood, Sulaiman and worshipping Allah for two thousand years with each prophet.

The reward of the nineteenth day is that all the angels of earth and heaven would come to your grave taking permission from Allah and every angel would be carrying gifts and drinks for you.

He would note down the reward of worship of one year for each feather of Jibraeel. He would grant you the reward of Tasbeeh of Arsh and Kursi; grant you Hoorul Ein equal to the number of verses in the Holy Quran.

He would include your grave among those of the martyrs and your face would resemble Yusuf bin Yaqoob . The reward of the twenty-second day is that Allah would send the Angel of death to you in the same way as He sends him to the prophets.

Eat and drink for there is no fear or sorrow for you. O Ummah of Muhammad (s.a.w.s.)! I swear by My Honor that I would surely send you to Paradise. The first and last communities would be surprised on seeing you and you would be given an illuminated crown and you would be made to ride a camel created from light, whose bridles will be of light. There will be a thousand circles on it and an angel would be standing on each circle holding a pillar of light in his hand and you will be made to enter Paradise without any accounting of deeds. Allah would look upon you with mercy on the twenty-sixth day; He would forgive all your sins except that of murdering or usurping property and purify your house seventy times a day from backbiting and imputation. On the twenty-seventh day, you will be granted the reward of helping all the believers, men as well as women, and the reward of dressing seventy thousand naked persons, helping one thousand soldiers and reciting the Holy Scriptures revealed on all prophets. On the twenty- eighth day, the Almighty Allah would build a hundred thousand houses of light in Behisht-e-Javed for you. He would reward you a hundred thousand houses made of silver in Jannat-e-Maawa and a hundred thousand houses made of pure amber in Jannat-e-Naeem.

On the twenty-ninth day, He would reward you a hundred thousand localities and each locality will have an illuminated dome and every dome will have a bed made of white camphor, every bed will have one thousand carpets of green brocade and a Hoorul Ein would be sitting on each carpet having seventy thousand high quality dresses and they would have eighty thousand hairs on their heads decorated with pearls and rubies. When thirty days are over, the Almighty Allah would grant you the reward of a thousand martyrs, a thousand truthful ones and the worship of fifty years for each day passed. He would note down the reward of two thousand fasts for every single fast. He would increase your position by levels equal to the number of things grown by the water of river Nile. You would be given freedom from Hell, permit to pass through the Sirat Bridge and protection from chastisement. The door of Paradise named Rayyaan, which will not open till Qiyamat would be opened for the men and women of the Ummah of Muhammad (s.a.w.s.) who observe fast and Rizwan, the treasurer of Paradise would give a call, ‘O Ummah of Muhammad! Move towards Rayyan.’ Then my people will enter this door into Paradise. Thus one who could not be forgiven in this month will not be forgiven in any other month. There is no power or strength except with the Greatest Lord!’"

There would be a distance equal to that of traveling a hundred years on a fast vehicle between each rank. There would be a city on each level having a castle made of precious stone and those cities won’t be cut off from each other. They would have surrounding walls, forts, high-rises, houses, wives, beds, Hoorul Ein, food laid on tables, servants, rivers, trees, ornaments and dresses. No one can describe them. When that person comes out of grave, each and every hair on his body would be illuminated and seventy thousand angels would surround him and walk with him till the door of Paradise. When this person enters Paradise, the angels would follow him until they reach the city, whose outer appearance would be like that of a ruby and it would be like green emerald from inside. It will have all sorts of things created by Allah in Paradise. When they reach here, he would be told, “O loved one of Allah! Do you know which city is this and what all things it has?” He would reply, “I don’t know but who are you?” They would say, “We are angels. When you recited Laa ilaaha illallaah in the world, we saw you and this city along with the servants is for you. You would be given a better reward from the Almighty Allah. You will see in Darus Salaam, the neighborhood of Allah what He has given you. You will see that this reward would never be taken back.” The narrator says that one must recite this supplication much so that one is rewarded more."

It is narrated that there was a rich man. When he saw the moon of Zilhajj, he observed fast on the next day. When this news reached the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.), he called that person and asked, “Why did you observe fast on that day?” He replied, “May my parents be sacrificed on you, these are the days of Mash-a’r and Hajj. I hope Allah includes me also in their prayers.” The Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) said, “You will get the reward of freeing a slave, sacrificing a hundred camels and carrying the load on a hundred horses in the way of Allah for each fast. When Yaum-e-Tarweeya (8th Zilhajj) arrives you will get the reward of freeing a thousand slaves, sacrificing a thousand camels and carrying load in the way of Allah on a thousand horses. You will get the reward of freeing two thousand slaves, sacrificing two thousand camels and carrying load in the way of Allah on two thousand horses for the fast of the day of Arafah. All these are compensation for the sins of sixty years before and after it, in your life.”"

If he recites Surah Zuha in the third rakat he would get the reward of feeding all the poor, cleaning and scenting them. If he recites Surah Tauheed ten times in the fourth rakat Allah would forgive the sins committed by him during past and future fifty years. Abu Ja’far Muhammad bin Ali, the writer of the book says that this reward is for the person who remained in Taqayyah and offered Salaat behind the Imam of other sect; then he should offer the above-mentioned Salaat with the intention of Eid prayer. One who prays behind an Imam appointed by Allah whose obedience is compulsory cannot offer any Salaat till noon. If one offers Salaat behind an Imam of one’s own sect (whose obedience is not compulsory) then too there is no need to offer any Salaat till noon."

The Almighty Allah would keep him with virtuous and honored angels and the Holy Quran would act as a shield against the fire of Hell for him on the Day of Judgment. The Holy Quran would say, ‘People who acted upon anything except me have got their result. O Allah! You give the best rewards to these people’. Allah would make the reciter of the Holy Quran wear two dresses of Paradise and keep the crown of honor on his head. Allah would tell the Holy Quran, ‘Are you satisfied now?’ It would reply, ‘I desire a better reward’. Now Allah would grant peace from right and an eternal Paradise from left and then make him enter Paradise. He would be told in Paradise, ‘Go on reciting a verse of the Holy Quran and your position will go on increasing by one level for each of them’. Then the Holy Quran would be addressed, ‘Are you pleased now?’ The Holy Quran would say, ‘Yes my Lord!’” Imam says that one who recites the Holy Quran much and is regular in it, the Almighty Allah would grant him this reward twice."

Imam replied, “One who keeps away from such sins due to which Allah throws one in Hell, Allah will forgive his sins and make him enter a good place (Paradise). There are seven greater sins, which condemn a person to Hell – killing an innocent, disobeying parents, taking interest, apostasy, accusing a virtuous woman of adultery, usurping the property of orphans and running away from Jihad.”"

So David said: ""O Lord, one who has recognized You is deserving that he does not cut off his hopes from You.”"

He used to do it so because Sadaqah goes into the hands of Allah before going into the hands of beggar. He used to say that I like to have in my hands too what Allah’s hands had held. Giving Sadaqah in darkness reduces the anger of Allah and wipes greater sins. It makes accounting of deeds easier. Sadaqah given during day causes abundance in wealth and life. Once Isa Ibne Maryam passed by a sea. He dropped his food in the sea. One of his companions asked, “O Ruhullah! Why did you do so? It was your food, why did you drop it?” He replied, “I dropped it so that the marine creatures consume it. It carries a great reward in front of Allah.”"

Imam Zainul Abideen said, “One who fulfils a need of a brother is like one who has begun with the desire of Allah. The Almighty Allah will fulfill his hundred desires, one of which is Paradise. One who solves the difficulty of a brother Allah will solve his difficulties on the Day of Judgment whatever be their number. One who helps a brother against an unjust man the Almighty Allah will save him from stumbling so that he can pass through the Sirat Bridge. One who tries to fulfill the desire of a brother and successfully does so is like a person who has pleased the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.). One who satisfies the thirst of a person, Allah will offer him the drink of Makhtum (sealed). One who feeds a hungry person, Allah will give him fruits of Paradise to eat. If someone dresses a bare person Allah will grant him dresses made of satin and silk. One who dresses someone else, the former will remain in Allah’s protection till that person is wearing the dress and even if a single thread is remaining. If someone protects the honor of a person Allah will appoint Wildan-e-Mukhalladin (boys who remain in Paradise forever) to serve him. If someone offers his mount to a person, Allah will make him ride a camel of Paradise and the angels will feel proud of him. One who gives shroud to a believing brother he is like a baby just born. If a person marries someone off to a loving and caring woman Allah will give him a beautiful face in grave, which will make his relatives happy. One who visits an ailing brother angels surround him and pray for him till he returns. Then angels tell him, ‘You have become pure. Congratulations for getting a pure Paradise’. By Allah, I consider fulfilling the wish of a person better than fasting for those two consecutive months while spending two sacred months in Etekaf.”"

Their conversation is known to only Allah, the Guardian of secrets. O Ishaq! Fear Allah as if you are seeing Him because even if you cannot see Him, He is definitely looking at you. If you think that He is not seeing you, you will become an infidel. If you have a belief that He is looking you and you hide your sins from other creatures and reveal them in front of Allah you have really underestimated His Sight.”"

If Allah had permitted it to take in the breath equal to the tip of a needle, it would have sucked all the people of earth with it and burnt them to ashes. The people of Hell seek refuge from its extreme heat, stink, filth and chastisement, which Allah has prepared for those who deserve Hell. There is a mountain inside it. All the residents of this mountain seek refuge from the extreme heat, stink, filth and chastisement of it, which Allah has prepared for them. Surely there is a ravine in this mountain. All the residents of this mountain seek refuge from the extreme heat, stink, filth and chastisement of this, which Allah has prepared for its residents. There is a well in that ravine and all the residents of this ravine seek refuge from the extreme heat, stink, filth and chastisement of this well, which is prepared by Allah for its residents. There is a serpent in that well. The residents of this well seek refuge from the filth, stink and poison of this serpent, which is made for the residents by Allah. There are seven boxes inside this serpent, out of which five are concerned with past Ummahs and two are related to this Ummah.” Ishaq asked, “May I be sacrificed for you, who are those five among the past and two in the present?” Imam replied, “As far as the past five are concerned, they are Qabeel; for he murdered his brother Habeel, Nimrod for he fought with Ibrahim regarding the Lord and said that he gives life and death, Firon; for he said that he was the supreme lord to his subjects, Yahuda; for he made a group of people Jew and Paul, who made some people Christians and from this Ummah are the two desert Arabs (infidels).”"

The Holy Prophet ﷺ narrated that Fatima Zahra will come surrounded by the women of her family on the Day of Judgment. When asked to enter Paradise, she will say, “I will not enter Paradise until I have seen how my daughters were treated after me.” She will be asked to look at the center of Qiyamat where Imam Husain will be standing headless. He will utter a loud cry and the Holy Prophet ﷺ himself will start mourning loudly. Angels will start weeping on seeing him and Almighty Allah will be enraged at that time. He will order the fire named Hab-hab (which has burned for a thousand years and had become black due to burning. No happiness would have ever entered this fire nor any sorrow would have come out of it) to bring the killers of Imam Husain even if they were Muslims. They will be put into Hell shackled in chains. If they cry, the fire will also cry. If they groan, the fire will also groan. They will cry out, “O Allah! Why were we put into Hell before the infidels?” They will be told, “Those who know are not like those who don’t know.”"

It is one of the canyons of Hell, which is reserved as the abode of the killers of Imam Husain . The water of Hell flows beneath it. Rivers like Sadeed and Hameem flow beneath it. They will never be able to come out of Hell. They won’t be able to come out of the filth coming out of the genitals of an adulteress, Hutama, Saqar etc. Whenever I pass by this mountain, I halt and see these people cry and seek help. However they did not think of anything while martyring my father. I tell them that this is the result of their deeds. When they had power, they did not care about us. When they got the kingdom, they martyred us, denied us our rights and trespassed them. They did injustice as per their wish without caring for us. ‘May Allah never forgive one who has a soft corner in his heart for you. Taste the fruits of your deeds. Allah does not do injustice to any servant.’”"

May Allah kill those who martyred your son.” Allah will say, “I will take revenge from those who martyred Husain in front of your lovers, Shias and followers.” Fatima will be mounted on a mount of Paradise, having a beautiful forehead, white face, black eyes, head made of pure gold and neck made of amber. Its rein will be of green satins. It will be decorated with jewels and its saddle wrapped with divine light. There will be divine mercy in it. Its one step will be equal to a farsakh of this world.

Alwan from Mundhir from Abi Abdillah who said: The narrator asked Imam Ja’far Sadiq , “O Master! How is it possible that a person goes to Paradise because of a house fly and another into Hell because of it?” Imam replied, “These two persons went to a tribe, which was celebrating a feast on that day. That tribe had an idol and none was allowed to go near it without offering a sacrifice. However there was no restriction on the size of sacrifice. The tribe refused to permit them passage unless they offered a sacrifice. One of those two persons said that he didn’t have anything to sacrifice. Then he caught a fly, killed it and offered it as a sacrifice while other companion refused to sacrifice even a fly for the sake of anyone except Allah. The tribal people killed him and he entered Paradise. On the other hand, the person who was left alive got punished in Hell.”"

You have sought the worldly matters from permissible means, but you were not able to, and sought it by prohibited means but you were not able to. Shall I direct you to a thing by which your world would be abundant, and you would have abundant followers?’ He said, ‘Of course!’ Shaytan said, ‘Innovate a Religion and invite the people towards it’. So, he did it and the people obeyed him, and he secured (a lot) from the world. Then he pondered and said, ‘What thing have I done? I innovated a religion and invited people to it. I do not see repentance for myself except that I should come to the ones I invited and return them back’. So, he went to his companions who had responded to him, and he said, 'Indeed, that which I have invited to is false, but rather it was I who innovated it and made it up’. So, they went on to say, ‘You are lying! But it is the truth, you are doubting in your religion, so you have returned (to falsehood)’. So, when he saw that, he deliberately chained himself, and pegged it to the ground, and chained himself around his neck, and said, 'I will remain in this condition until Allah forgives me’. The Almighty Allah sent one of His prophets to him and told him to convey the message to the person, 'I swear by My honor that I am not going to forgive you even if you repent so much that the joints of your body are cut. If the person wants to be forgiven, he should bring back to life those people who died on his religion and bring them back (to truth).’."

Amirul Momineen said, “Surely Allah will not send chastisement on all because of the sins of some people until they commit sins secretly and others are not aware of it. However if they sin openly and are not restrained from it, everybody will be deserving of divine chastisement. If an unjust king kills someone out of oppression and enmity or does any other injustice, you should not remain over there. If you are, helping the victim becomes obligatory for you. However there is no responsibility upon you until the innocence of the victim is proved. People of Bani Israel were careless about prohibited deeds. Once a person sinned in front of his brother who advised him not to do so but he turned a deaf ear to his words. This sin did not affect their friendship in any way. At last, Allah put the love of that sin in their hearts and these verses are revealed for those persons: Those who disbelieved from among the children of Israel were cursed by the tongue of Dawood and Isa, son of Maryam; this was because they disobeyed and used to exceed the limit. They used not to forbid each other the hateful things (which) they did; certainly evil was that which they did.”46"

Abu Huraira and Ibne Abbas said that the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) delivered a sermon in Medina before he passed away. This sermon was such that it caused the eyes of people to overflow. Their hearts began to beat fast. Their condition became terrible. Bilal was called to invite people to the mosque. The Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) mounted the pulpit and asked the people to come forward. People came forward and sat near one another. Then the Holy Prophet asked them to come forward again. A man asked, “For whom are we leaving the space?” The Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) said, “Leave space for angels. When angels come, they do not sit in front or back of you. They sit by your left and right side.” The man asked, “Why do they sit by our left and right side? Are they more exalted or are we?” The Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) said, “You are more exalted.” Then the Holy Prophet asked that person to sit down and started his sermon. All praise be to Allah for we praise Him and seek help from Him only. We have faith only on Him. I swear that there is no Lord except Allah and there is no partner for him. Surely Muhammad is His servant and Messenger. We seek refuge in Allah from our inner evils and bad deeds. I seek refuge in Allah that if Allah guides someone, no one can deviate him and one who is misguided, none can be his guide.” “O people! There are thirty liars in this Ummah. First of them is from Sanaa and the other from Yamama.” “O people! One who swears that there is no god except Allah, with pure intention and without mixing any belief in it and meets Allah, he will certainly enter Paradise.” Ali stood up and asked him to explain the meaning of pure intention and not mixing anything. The Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) explained, “It means that one should not be greedy about the world. He should not have gathered wealth from unlawful means and should not have his heart attached to the wealth. Some people talk about good deeds but their actions are like bad people. Hence one who does not have this characteristic in him and he says that there is no god except Allah, there is Paradise for him. Hell is for one who tries to accumulate wealth and does not care about the hereafter.” “One who befriends an unjust enemy or helps him, the Angel of Death descends with bad tidings that Allah’s curse be upon him and he will abide in Hell forever and surely this a very bad destination.” “One, who supports an unjust ruler for the sake of a favor, will accompany that ruler in Hell. One, who advises a ruler to do injustice, will accompany the ruler in Hamaan. He and his ruler will get the severest chastisement in Hell.” “If someone increases the greed and love of a worldly thing in any person, Allah will be severe with him and put him in the lowest level of Hell along with Qaroon.” “One who builds a large house for showoff, the Almighty Allah will put him below the seven layers of earth. Rings of fire will be put around his neck and he will be thrown into Hell.” The people asked, “O Messenger of Allah! How is the house of showoff made?” The Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) said, “It is by building a house more than one’s need or building a house for showing pride.” “One who oppresses the workers, Allah destroys his good deeds. He will make the fragrance of the breeze of Paradise prohibited for him while the fragrance of the breeze of Paradise is perceived from the distance traveled in five hundred years.” “One who usurps a single yard of his neighbor’s land, the Almighty Allah will turn that yard into a fire equal to that of seven layers of earth and put it around his neck and he will be thrown into Hell.” “One who purposely forgets the Holy Quran after memorizing it, will meet Allah thirsty and deprived on the Day of Judgment and Allah will make a snake overpower him for each forgotten verse.” “One who does not act on the Quran after learning it and the love of this world has more effect on him, is deserving of severe chastisement of Allah. He is like a Jew or a Christian who have forgotten Allah.” “One who commits a prohibited deed with a woman or with a child or a man, will smell worse than a corpse on the Day of Judgment. People will be troubled by his odor. Then the person will be thrown into Hell. None of his words will be heeded. None of his cries will be sympathized. None of his atonements will be accepted and all his good deeds will be destroyed. Then he will be thrown in the coffin having nails. He will be hit with thick iron rods which will cause all the nails to pierce his body. If a single drop of his sweat is kept on four hundred communities, all of them will die. He will face the severest punishment.” “One who commits fornication with a slave-girl or a woman other than a Jew, Christian, Zoroastrian, Muslim, Allah will open thirty thousand doors of Hell in his grave. Snakes, scorpions and flames will come out of them, which will burn him till the Day of Judgment. The foul odor coming out of his genitals will trouble people. People will relate him with this characteristic only till the Day of Judgment. Then he will be ordered to go to Hell. He will face severe chastisement there and people will be troubled by him. This is because the Almighty Allah has prohibited wrong and no one can be more honored than Him. He has prohibited wrong with His honor and has set the limits.” “One who peeps into the houses of neighbors and looks at the genitals of man or hair or any part of woman’s body, it is rightful for the Almighty Allah to keep him in Hell along with those hypocrites who used to be on lookout of bad things in people. The Almighty Allah will not take him away from this world till He has disgraced him and will display his genitals in public on the Day of Judgment.” “One who shows displeasure to Allah because of insufficient earnings, complains about it to someone else and does not remain patient, none of his good deeds will reach Allah. When he meets Allah, He will be angry with that person.” “One who becomes proud after wearing a dress, Allah will take his grave near Hell. His grave will remain near Hell till the time the earth and sky exist. Qaroon had also become proud after wearing a dress. The earth swallowed it and it remained inside the earth till the Day of Judgment.” “One who has married in a lawful manner with lawful wealth but intends to be proud, Allah will make that marriage a disgrace and nothing else. Allah will keep his grave near Hell as much as he had benefited from that woman and throw him at the distance of seventy years inside Hell.” “One who does injustice in giving Mahr (dower) to a woman, is like a fornicator for Allah. On the Day of Judgment, Allah will tell him: I had married this woman to you according to My promise but you broke it. Allah will Himself ask for her right. He will take away all the good deeds of that person. Then too the right of that woman will not be paid. The man will be ordered to be thrown into Hell. If a witness turns hostile, Allah will make him eat his own flesh on the Day of Judgment. He will enter Hell chewing his own tongue.” “One who has two wives and he does not do justice to anyone with regards to his wealth, will be gathered on the Day of Judgment thirsty and will be put in Hell. One who troubles his neighbor without any reason, the Almighty Allah will make even the fragrance of Paradise prohibited for him and his destination will be Hell. Beware, Allah will ask that person about the rights of his neighbor. A person who trespasses the rights of a neighbor is not from us.” “One who insults a Muslim because of his poverty, has dishonored the rights of Allah. He will remain under severe chastisement of Allah till he pleases that person and Allah will be his strong enemy.” “One who honors a poor Muslim, Allah will be pleased with him on the Day of Judgment. One who is presented with world and hereafter and he chooses the world and leaves the hereafter, when he meets Allah, he will have no good deed which can save him from Hell. One who accepts the hereafter and leaves this world, Allah will be pleased with him on the Day of Judgment.” “One who can commit a prohibited act with a woman but does not do so out of the fear of Allah, Allah makes the fire of Hell prohibited for him and grants him peace from a great terror. He will make that person enter Paradise. However if he commits that act, Allah will make Paradise prohibited for him and put him in Hell.” “One who earns unlawfully, Allah will not reward his deeds like charity, freeing slaves, Hajj and Umrah. He will punish him as much as the reward for those deeds. And if something is left after his death, it will be his luggage on the way to Hell.” “One who can earn unlawfully but does not do so out of the fear of Allah, is deserving of Allah’s love and mercy and will be ordered to enter Paradise. One who shakes hands with a non-Mahram woman, Allah will bring him on the Day of Judgment with his hands tied to the back of his neck and he will be put into Hell.” “One who jokes with a non-Mahram woman, will receive punishment for a thousand years for each sentence he spoke. One who takes a woman in his arms or kisses her or hugs her or tells her something that she gets ready for the prohibited act, both of them will be punished. However if all these things are done to a woman forcefully, the double punishment will be given to that man. A person who cheats a Muslim in trade and one who adulterates goods is not from us. He will be gathered along with Jews on the Day of Judgment because a Muslim cannot cheat people.” “One who does not help his neighbor at the time of need, will be deprived of Divine Mercy and Allah will leave him on his own. If Allah leaves someone on his own he gets destroyed and Allah does not accept any of his excuses. If a woman hurts her husband, her Salaat and other good deeds will not be accepted till she pleases him even if she has fasted for an age, offered Prayer in nights, freed slaves and spent in the way of Allah. She will be the first one to be thrown into Hell. If a man hurts his wife, the Almighty Allah will break his bones on the Day of Judgment and he will be overpowered by fire. He will be gathered with his hands tied to the back of his neck and put into Hell.” “One who thinks about cheating his Muslim brother, is involved in the displeasure of Allah during that time. Allah will remain displeased with him till he repents. If he dies in this condition, he does not die a Muslim. Beware, one who cheats Muslims is not from us [the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) repeated this sentence twice].” “One who holds a lash in his hand on the order of an unjust ruler, Allah will make that lash a snake whose length will be equal to seven thousand spans and will make that snake overpower him in Hell. He will live in Hell forever.” “One who backbites a Muslim, his fast and ablutions are void. If he dies in this condition, he will die considering lawful what Allah has prohibited.” “One who slanders, the Almighty Allah will make fire overpower him in his grave, which will burn him till the Day of Judgment. When he comes out of the grave, he will have a serpent overpowering him, which will bite unto his flesh till he enters Hell.” “One who controls his anger, forgives his brother and remains patient, Allah will reward him equal to that of a martyr.” “One who does injustice to a poor or considers him lowly with his pride, Allah will make him come on the Day of Judgment having size equal to that of an ant. Then he will be thrown into Hell.” “One who refuses to listen to the backbiting of a Muslim brother, the Almighty Allah will close one thousand doors of evil for him in this world and the hereafter. However, if he doesn’t stop and remains pleased, he will get punishment equal to that of backbiting.” “One who blames an innocent man or woman, Allah will destroy the deeds of that person. Seventy thousand angels will lash him from all sides. His flesh will be bitten by snakes and scorpions and, he will be ordered to be taken to Hell.” “One who drinks wine in the world, Allah will make him drink the poison of scorpions. The flesh of his face will fall in a utensil before he drinks that poison. His skin and flesh will be reduced to pieces when he starts drinking it. All the people will be troubled because of this. Then he will be thrown into Hell. Similarly a person who drinks, prepares, sells, buys, delivers, orders or earns from wine will get the same punishment.” “Beware, one who makes a Jew, Christian or a person of some other religion drink wine, his sin is equal to that of the person who drinks it. Beware, one who buys wine for someone else, Allah will not accept his Prayer, fasts, Hajj and Umrah till he repents and if he dies before repenting, it is rightful for Allah to make him drink Sadid of Hell for each gulp of wine. Beware, Allah has prohibited wine and especially one which is intoxicating.” “One who takes usury the Almighty Allah will fill his stomach with fire equal to the amount of usury. One who does business with that money, Allah will not accept any of his good deeds. He will face the curse of Allah and His angels till he has even a single penny of it left with him.” “One who is dishonest in other’s trust, does not return others belongings and dies in this condition, will die on any other religion except Islam. Allah will be angry when he meets Him and will order him to be put into Hell. He will live at the end of Hell forever.” “One, who gives false testimony for a Muslim a Zimmi or anyone else, will be hung by his tongue on the Day of Judgment and will remain at the lowest level along with the hypocrites.” “One who does not help his slave or servant at the time of his difficulty, Allah will also not reply to him on the Day of Judgment and will tell him to go to Hell.” “One who hurts his wife so much that she seeks to free herself after returning Mahr, Allah will also not be pleased with any other punishment except Hell for him. As Allah gets angry in the case of orphans, He gets angry in the case of a woman.” “One who talks bad about his brother or slanders about him in front of a ruler and the ruler does not take any action, all of his good deeds will be destroyed. However, if ruler hurts his brother, Allah will keep that person at the level in Hell where Haman is kept.” “One who recites the Holy Quran for showoff or to earn something, his face will have no flesh on the Day of Judgment. The Holy Quran will hit him with a pointed iron spear on his back. It will take him to Hell and those who are thrown into Hell are destroyed.” “One who learns the Holy Quran but does not follow it, he will be blind on the Day of Judgment. He will say: O Allah! I could see. Why did you make me blind? Allah will say: ‘When Our signs reached you, you forgot them. Today they have forgotten you;’ and he will be ordered to be thrown into Hell. One who knows that a thing is usurped and then too buys it, his sin is equal to that of the usurper.” “One who becomes a pimp, Allah will make Paradise prohibited for him and make Hell his destination. Hell is a large place. He will be punished by Allah till he dies.” “One who cheats his Muslim brother, Allah will take away abundance (Barakat) from his sustenance. His earnings will be destroyed and he will be left on his own.” “One who buys a thing knowing that it is stolen from somewhere, his sin is equal to that of the thief.” “A person who cheats a Muslim is not from us nor are we from him in this world and in the hereafter.” “Beware, do not relate the evils of a person after hearing bad about him for such a person will be punished for those evils which he has narrated. If someone relates the good deeds of a person to all, he will be rewarded for those good deeds.” “One who praises a woman and narrates her beauty in front of a man and if that man is misguided and commits a prohibited act with her, that person will not go away from this world till Allah has wreaked His anger on him. If Allah sends anger on a person, seven layers of earth and all of the seven heavens get angry with him. The sin of that person is same as that of the man who committed the prohibited act.” Someone asked, “O Messenger of Allah! What if they repent?” The Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) replied, “The Almighty Allah will accept the repentance of that man and woman but will not forgive the person who described the beauty of that woman.” “One who looks at a woman with lust, Allah will put rods of fire in his eyes. He will remain in this state till the time Allah does the accounting of deeds of other people. Then Allah will order to put him into Hell.” “One who gives food to someone to showoff, the Almighty Allah will feed him Sadid of Hell. When it enters the stomach, it will turn into fire. He will remain in this state till Allah has done accounting of deeds of the people.” “One who commits adultery with a married woman, thick blood will come out of his genitals having quantity equal to the distance traveled in five hundred years. The people of Hell will suffer from the foul odor of both of them. Their punishment will be severest. Allah will also give severe chastisement to that married woman who looks into the eyes of a man other than her husband or a Mahram. All her deeds will be wasted when she does this. If she commits adultery on the bed of someone else, it is rightful for Allah to put her in Hell after punishing her in the grave.” “If a woman seeks divorce from her husband, Allah, angels, messengers and all people curse her. The angel of death comes down to give her news of Hell. On the Day of Judgment, she will be told to go to Hell along with other hellish people. Beware, Allah and His Messenger hate the person seeking divorce without genuine cause. They also hate the man who troubles his wife so much that she is forced to seek divorce.” “One who is made the Imam of congregation by a few people and if he performs Qirat, Ruku, prostration, Tashahud and Qiyam properly, he will get the reward of the entire congregation. However if such a person does not perform these acts properly, his Prayer will be rejected and he will not be able to bear the load of this rejected Salaat. He will be accounted as an unjust leader.” “One who does not want to correct his followers, will not become their leader by the order of Allah.” Amirul Momineen stood up and asked, “May my parents be sacrificed for you, O Messenger of Allah! What will be the condition of a leader who could not guide his followers nor had become leader by the order of Allah?” The Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) said, “He will follow those four persons whose punishment will be severest on the Day of Judgment i.e. his number will come after Shaitaan, Firon, a killer and an unjust ruler.” “One who does not give loan to a Muslim brother who is in need, Allah will make Paradise prohibited for him on the day when helpers will be rewarded. One who remains patient in spite of the bad nature of his wife, Allah will reward him with the patience of Prophet Ayyub according to patience he has shown during each day and night. That woman will be punished equal to the number of grains of sand in each day and night. If she dies before pleasing her husband, she will be put in the lowest level of Hell along with the hypocrites.” “If a woman does not agree with her husband, does not remain patient on what sustenance Allah has given, remains harsh to him and demands those things from him, which he cannot afford, till the time she does this Allah will not accept those deeds from her, which can save her from the fire of Hell and Allah will remain angry with her.” “A person who honors his brother is like one who honors Allah. What will Allah reward him? One who takes the responsibility of a community on his shoulders but does not fulfill it, will have to live in a pit of Hell for a thousand years for each day he had ruled over them. However if he had ruled according to Allah’s wish, Allah will make him free. If he had been unjust, Allah will throw him into Hell and it will take him seventy years to reach the bottom.” “One, who does not rule according to Allah’s orders, is like one who testifies falsely. He will be put in Hell and will be given the same punishment as that of a person who testifies falsely. One who double-talks and is double-faced in this world, will have two tongues and faces in the hereafter.” “One who comes forward to make peace among people, the angels will send salutations on him till he returns and he will get reward of the night of Qadr. One who creates a rift between two persons, will get same amount of punishment for it. Allah’s curse will fall on him till he enters Hell and his chastisement will be doubled.” “One who tries to make public the defects of his brother and exposes his secrets, Allah will expose his secrets as soon as he steps inside Hell.” “One who visits his relatives, Allah will grant him reward equal to a hundred martyrs. If he gifts something or helps them the Almighty Allah will grant him forty million rewards for each step taken and increase his position by forty levels and he will be as if he has worshipped Allah for a hundred years.” “One who creates a rift between two persons or breaks relations, Allah will be angry with him and curse him in this world and the hereafter. He will be punished for breaking relations. One who tries to get two believers married and they both get married, Allah will marry one thousand Hoorul Ein to him. Every Hoorul Ein will be inside a palace of pearls and rubies. He will be given the reward of worshipping at night for one year and fasting during day for each step he takes and for each sentence he speaks in arranging the marriage.” “One who plays a role in separating a husband and wife, Allah will be angry with him. He will be cursed in this world and the hereafter. It is rightful for Allah to put him in Hell for a thousand years. One who tries to create a rift between two people, will be cursed in the hereafter and he will hate to see his face.” “One who takes a visually handicapped man to the mosque, house or for some other work, Allah will grant him reward of freeing a slave for each step he has taken and angels will send salutations on him.” “One who does something for a visually handicapped person; Allah will save him from two calamities. He will save him from fire and hypocrisy. He will be immersed in Divine Mercy till he returns. One who takes care of a sick person for a day and night, Allah will resurrect him along with Prophet Ibrahim and he will pass over the Sirat Bridge like wind.” “One who tries to fulfill a wish of a sick person and fulfills it, will be purified of sins as if he has just come out of his mother’s womb.” One of the persons from Ansar asked, “What if the sick person is one of his relatives?” The Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) said, “He who fulfills the needs of his relatives will deserve a great reward. One who avoids his relatives and breaks relations, Allah will make reward prohibited for him on the day when helpers will be rewarded. He will not be able to come out of there. One who gives loan to a poor and takes back justly, the account of his bad deeds will be started once again. Allah will grant him a thousand Qintars for each dirham he had paid.” “One who solves the problem of a person in this world, Allah will look at him with mercy. He will enter Paradise because of this good deed. Allah will solve all his problems of this world and the hereafter.” “One who goes out to solve the differences between a husband and wife, Allah will grant him reward of one thousand martyrs in the way of Allah. He will get reward of worshipping at night and fasting during day for one year for each step he takes and each sentence he speaks. One who gives loan to his Muslim brother, will be given rewards equal to the weight of Mount Ohad, Sina and Razva for each dirham. If he does not force the person to repay his loan on time, he will pass from the Sirat Bridge before a twinkling of an eye. There will be no accounting of deeds or chastisement for him.” “If a Muslim brother relates his needs to a person and the latter does not give him a loan, Paradise will be made prohibited for him on the day when helpers will be rewarded. One who does not fulfill the wish of someone in spite of being capable of doing so, will be punished like Ashar.” Auf bin Malik stood up and asked, “O messenger of Allah! How much is the sin of Ashar?” The Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) said, “The sinners of Ashar are cursed by Allah and His angels every day and night. A person who is cursed by Allah cannot be helped by anyone. One who does good to someone and talks about it proudly in front of him, his good deed will be void. His efforts will go waste. Beware, the Almighty Allah has prohibited Paradise for someone who talks about one’s good deeds, is proud, slanders, drinks wine, talks much, eats much, has bad character and is disobedient.” “One who acts as a medium to provide charity to the poor, will get the reward of paying Sadaqah. If forty thousand people act as a means to provide charity to the poor, all of them will get separate and full reward for it. Beware there is no one nearer to Allah than one who has piety and one who does good to others.” “One who builds a mosque in this world, for each span of earth, Allah will reward him with a city made of gold, silver, pearls, rubies and emeralds. It will be as large as the distance covered in forty years. Each will have forty million palaces and every palace will have forty million houses and every house will have forty million rooms and every room will have forty thousand young boys and girls to serve him. It will have forty thousand dining tables, each table having forty thousand large trays, each tray having forty million types of cuisines. Allah will grant that person such a power that he is able to enjoy all the cuisines and women in one day.” “One who becomes a muezzin of a mosque and gives Azaan for Allah’s pleasure only, will get the reward of forty million prophets, forty million truthful ones and forty million martyrs. He will be able to give salvation to forty million communities, each having forty million people. He will have forty million cities in each Paradise and every palace will have forty million houses and every house will have forty million rooms and every room will have forty million beds each occupied by a Hoorul Ein married to him. Every room will be forty million times that of a room in this world. Every wife will have forty million young boys and girls at her service. Every room will have forty thousand dining tables each having forty thousand trays. Each tray will have forty million types of different cuisines. If all the Jinn and men become his guest, they will be accommodated easily in one small room. They will get food, wine, perfumes, clothes, fruits, gifts, jewelry and rare things in that room itself. The things present in that room will be enough for them. There will be no need to go to other rooms. When a muezzin says: Ash-hadu allaa ilaaha illallaah in Azaan, forty million angels surround him, send salutations on him and repent for him. He comes under the shade of Allah as he ends Azaan. His reward is noted down by forty million angels. After that it goes above to Allah.” “One who goes to a mosque, will get ten rewards for each step while going or returning home. His ten sins will be forgiven and his position will be increased by ten levels. One who tries to offer Salaat in congregation wherever he is, will pass by the Sirat Bridge swiftly.” “One who tries to offer Salaat in the first row of congregation and starts his Salaat along with the congregation and does not trouble any believer in Prayer the Almighty Allah will reward him like a muezzin. One who builds a shelter on a way for travelers, Allah will make him ride a huge mount made of pearls when he is resurrected. His face will be bright in front of the people of Paradise. He will accompany Prophet Ibrahim in the dome of Ibrahim. People will say: This is an angel whom no one had seen before. He will be able to make forty million people enter Paradise due to his intercession. One who puts forward his wish before his brother and he fulfills it, Allah will look at him with mercy and it is rightful for Allah not to punish him. However if someone helps his brother without being requested, Allah will grant him the reward of seventy martyrs who have fasted in the month of Ramadan for the nearness to Allah and who have kept their ears, eyes, genitals and other parts of their body away from what He prohibited. Allah keeps him so near that he can touch the knee of Prophet Ibrahim .” “One who digs a well and endows to Muslims as water starts coming in it, will get the reward of those who offer Prayer after performing ablutions from its water. Also he will get the reward of freeing slaves equal in number to the hairs of every human, animal and bird. People equal to the number of stars will reach the Holy Cistern in the hereafter because of his intercession.” Someone asked what the Holy Cistern was. The Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) said thrice: “It is my cistern. One who digs a grave for a Muslim seeking reward from Allah, Allah will make Hell prohibited for him. He will grant him a house in Paradise. He will make him reach the cistern which has goblets equal to the number of stars. The length and breadth of that cistern is equal to the distance between Ila and Sanaa.” “One who gives Ghusl to a Muslim body being trustworthy, will get the reward of freeing a slave for each hair and his position will be elevated by a hundred levels.” Umar bin Khattab asked, “O Messenger of Allah! What is meant by being trustworthy?” The Holy Prophet answered, “He should cover the genitals of the dead body. If he does not do so, he will not get any reward and his defects will be exposed in this world and in the hereafter. If someone offers Prayer for a dead, Jibraeel and other seventy million angels send salutations on him. All his sins from beginning to end will be forgiven. One who is present when a dead is being buried, will get the reward of one Qirat for each step he takes from burial to his way back home. One Qiraat has weight of Mt. Ohad in Mizan (Balance). One who weeps due to the fear of Allah, each of his tear will be as heavy as Mt. Ohad in Mizan. He will get rivers in Paradise for each tear. These rivers will have heavenly cities and palaces on their banks, which no eye would have ever seen, no ear would have ever heard of and which no mind would have imagined.” “One who visits a sick, will get seventy million rewards for each step he takes till he returns home. Seventy million of his sins will be wiped out and his position will be raised seventy million levels for each step. Seventy million angels will be appointed to look after him in his grave and repent for him till the Day of Judgment.” “One who goes for the burial of a dead, will get a hundred million rewards for each step. A hundred million of his sins will be wiped off and his position will be elevated a hundred million levels for each step. If he offers Prayer of dead, a million angels will come at the time of his burial. They will repent for him till he is raised from the grave.” “One who goes for Hajj or Umrah, till the time he returns, will get a hundred million rewards for each step, a hundred million sins will be wiped off and his position will be raised a hundred million levels. Allah returns him a hundred times of each dirham and dinar he takes along on the journey. He gives him hundred times the reward of good deeds done on his journey. He will remain in the protection of Allah. If he dies, he will enter Paradise and if he returns alive, he will be successful, forgiven and come with his prayers accepted. Value his prayers for Allah does not reject his supplication. He will certainly intercede for a hundred thousand people on the Day of Judgment.” “If someone does good to the relatives of a person who has gone for Hajj or Umrah, his reward will not be less than the reward of that person. One who goes out for Jihad in the way of Allah, will be given seven hundred million rewards, seven hundred million of his sins will be forgiven and his position will be raised seven hundred million ranks for each step he takes till he returns home. He will be in Allah’s protection. If he dies, he will be considered a martyr. If he returns alive, all his sins will be forgiven and his supplications will be accepted. One who visits his brother will get the reward of freeing a million slaves for each step he takes till he returns home. His position will increase a million levels and a million sins will be wiped off. He will be given a million rewards.” Abu Huraira was asked, “Didn’t the Holy Prophet say: One who frees slaves, will be freed from Hell?” Abu Huraira said that I had asked about this to the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.). He replied, “Yes, and his ranks reach Allah at Divine throne. One who learns the Holy Quran for Allah’s pleasure and for understanding the religion, will get the reward of meeting the angels and all the messengers. One who learns the Holy Quran to showoff, to debate with fools, to compete with scholars and to earn this world from it, Allah will disperse his bones and his punishment will be severest in Hell. Allah will be so angry with him that He will give all types of punishments of Hell to him. One who learns the Holy Quran seeking reward from Allah, is humble and teaches it to other people, none of the people of Paradise will be rewarded like him. No one will have a position better than him in Paradise.” “Beware, knowledge is better than action, the standard of faith is piety. A scholar is one who practices what he has learnt even if it is very less. Do not underestimate any sin because a sin does not remain small if repeated again and again. Also no greater sin is greater than Istighfar (repentance). Allah will enquire about your each and every sin even if it is pointing out a defect in the dress of your brother.” “O servants of Allah! You will be resurrected on the same beliefs which you had while dying. Allah has created both Paradise and Hell. One who opts for Hell instead of Paradise, his wishes will never be fulfilled and a person who opts for Paradise is successful forever. He will be successful according to the following words of Allah: Then whoever is removed far away from the fire and is made to enter the garden, he indeed has attained the object.” “Beware, my Lord has ordered me that I fight with people till they say that there is no god except Allah. If they say so, I will guarantee the protection of their souls and wealth. However their rights and accounting is with Allah. Know that Allah Whose name is greatest has described each and everything which is loved. Similarly He has also described all those things, which are abominable. He has stopped people from this. So that those who are destroyed, know it before they do so and those who remain alive do so after knowing it. Know that the Almighty Allah does not do injustice and oppression. He does not forgive one who does injustice. He is sitting in His ambush to punish those who sin and reward those who do good deeds. One who does good will benefit from Him and one who does evil will face punishment from Him. Allah does not do injustice to His servants. O people! I have grown old and my bones have become weak. I have heard the news of the arrival of my death. My end is near. The desire to meet my Lord is increasing. I think that this is the last meeting with you. By the way, keep watching me till I am alive. And when I pass away, Allah is the only helper of each and every male and female believer. Was salaamu a’laikum wa rah’matullaahi wa barakaatuh.” Before the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) descended from the pulpit, Ansar (Helpers) ran to him and asked, “May Allah sacrifice us for you, O Messenger of Allah! May our parents be sacrificed for you! Who can bear this suffering? How will we live after today?” The Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) said, “May my parents be sacrificed for you! I have asked forgiveness from my Lord for you. He has said that the doors of repentance are open till the trumpet is blown.” Then the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) turned towards the people and said, “If someone repents a year before his death, his repentance will be accepted. If a year is more, one who repents a month before his death, his repentance will be accepted. If a month is more, one who repents one Friday before his death, his repentance will be accepted. If one Friday is more, one who repents a day before his death, his repentance will be accepted. If a day is more, one who repents an hour before his death, his repentance will be accepted. If that is more, one who repents till his last breath (he pointed towards his neck), his repentance will be accepted.” Then the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) descended from the pulpit. This was the last time he addressed the people before passing away."
