Kitāb al-Zuhd,The Book of Asceticism,,Ḥusayn b. Saʿīd al-Ahwāzī,Shaykh Tahir Ridha Jaffer,"Kitāb al-Zuhd, is penned by the reputable 3rd century Shīʿī scholar and narrator, al-Ḥusayn b. Saʿīd al-Ahwāzī. It is a beautiful work in Islamic literature that examines ethics and character within the context of spiritual self-discipline and asceticism (Zuhd). Focusing on the teachings of the Ahl al-Bayt (as), the book underscores the significance of good character and etiquette as fundamental to the life of a devout Muslim. Comprising nearly three hundred narrations, this text furnishes practical advice to believers aiming to elevate their moral and ethical conduct. The narrations provide insights that transcend temporal bounds, retaining their relevance and applicability to the modern world, and serve as a guide to enhancing a believer's life in both the worldly and spiritual realms. Kitab al-Zuhd offers a valuable wellspring of ethical teachings, guiding believers towards higher stations of moral and spiritual excellence as inspired by the teachings of the Ahl al-Bayt (as).",1 | Introduction,Chapter 1 | Translator’s Introduction,Ḥadīth #1,-,"In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful All praise belongs to Allah, Lord of the worlds, and blessings and salutations upon the Noble Prophet Muḥammad (ṣ) and his pure progeny, the Ahl al-Bayt . Good character and etiquette is the foundation upon which the life of a pious Muslim is established. Perfection of morals is said to have been the goal of the Prophet’s message, as reflected in his own words. As such, it has always been part and parcel of the teachings of divinely appointed guides. Indeed, without good character, a believer has little worth and can end up doing more harm to the cause of the faith than anything else. Human perfection has many levels. The greater the amount of self discipline and effort on the part of an individual, the higher the level of perfection that he would attain. In reality, a human being stands between two extremes, the lowest of which is below the level of beasts and the highest of which surpasses even the lofty station of angels. It is through ethics that progress is made towards higher stations. The goal of ethics is to raise and guide people from the lowest animal state to the most exalted position that is superior to that of all other creatures. Having realised this, throughout the ages scholars have focused their attention on the subject of ethics and have penned numerous treatises on the subject. As Muslims and followers of the Ahl al-Bayt , we have the added advantage of access to a wellspring of ethical teachings that have reached us from the Infallible guides. This saves us from the need to refer to fallible scholars and philosophers who refer to their own intuition and understanding to decipher ethical dilemmas. The present work comprises two hundred and ninety narrations on ethical subjects, compiled by a trustworthy individual who was himself a companion of the Imams . That on its own makes it a highly valuable text. Most, if not all, of the teachings found herein transcend time in terms of their relevance and importance, and offer practical advice to believers that would go a long way in improving their lives in both this world and the next. On the question of the authenticity and soundness of the traditions, it is noteworthy that while the chains of transmission of most of the traditions in this work have been adduced, not all are complete or sound. However, this is not the only gauge of soundness, especially with traditions about etiquette and ethics. Rather, other corroborating evidence from the Qurʾān and established traditions would be sufficient to verify the soundness of the narrations. For this, each tradition needs to be examined individually, and that is something for experts of ḥadīth to embark upon. Suffice it to say that most of the traditions found in this work are indeed generally accepted by scholars and have been related in other later ḥadīth compilations as well."

Kitab al-Zuhd offers a valuable wellspring of ethical teachings, guiding believers towards higher stations of moral and spiritual excellence as inspired by the teachings of the Ahl al-Bayt (as).",1 | Introduction,Chapter 1 | Translator’s Introduction,Ḥadīth #2,-,"Al-Ḥusayn ibn Saʿīd ibn Ḥammād ibn Saʿīd ibn Mihrān, whose great grandfather was from the clients (mawālī) of Imam Zayn al-ʿĀbidīn , was born in Kūfah, though the precise year of his birth is not known. Later, he migrated to Ahwāz, hence he is known by the title al-Ahwāzī. He was a companion of the Infallible Imams and has narrated traditions from Imam al-Riḍā, Imam al-Jawād and Imam al-Hādī . According to the scholars of rijāl, he was a reliable transmitter of ḥadīth.[1] In the introduction of his book Man Lā Yaḥḍuruhu al-Faqīh, al-Shaykh al-Ṣadūq speaks highly of a number of texts. Among these are the works of al-Ḥusayn ibn Saʿīd al-Ahwāzī, including his Kitāb al-Zuhd.[2] These works were well-known during his time and scholars would regularly refer to them. Al-Ḥusayn ibn Saʿīd has been considered a reliable and praiseworthy individual by the early biographers such as al-Ṭūsī and al- Najāshī, as evinced in their respective works. About thirty of his works have been mentioned in early bibliographical texts, not all of which have reached us. Kitāb al-Zuhd and Kitāb al-Muʾmin are perhaps two of the better-known works that are available as independently published monographs. Some of the other works attributed to him include titles such as: Kitāb al-Taqiyyah, Kitāb al-Muruwwah, Kitāb al-Ḥudūd, Kitāb al-Duʿāʾ among others. It is also noteworthy that his name appears in the chains of over five thousand traditions. His brother al-Ḥasan ibn Saʿīd was also a reputable scholar, and in some bibliographical works, the two brothers are mentioned together. Due to the similarity of their names, it has been suggested that some of the works attributed to al-Ḥusayn ibn Saʿīd may actually have been penned or compiled by his brother al-Ḥasan. This does not impugn the authority or value of the works, however, since al-Ḥasan ibn Saʿīd was also a reliable scholar and authority in his own right. Al-Ḥusayn ibn Saʿīd moved from Kūfah to Ahwāz, and later to Qum, where he resided until he passed away. The exact year of his demise is not known, but there is some evidence to indicate that he was alive in 254 AH.[3] It is reported that before his death, he gave all his books to Ḥusayn ibn al-Ḥasan ibn Abān, the son of his host in Qum, who then transmitted all of his books.[4]"

The source we have chosen for this translation is the edition that has been meticulously put together, after comparing a number of available manuscripts and also referring to secondary sources, by the esteemed scholar and researcher Mirzā Ghulām Riḍā ʿIrfāniyān, and published in the year 1361 AH Solar. Many of the traditions compiled in this work are also found in other sources such as Kulaynī’s al-Kāfī, or al-Ṣadūq’s al-Amālī among others. At times, these latter works seem to have more complete and accurate versions of the traditions. It is perhaps for this reason that in more recent times Kitāb al-Zuhd has not gotten the same attention as some of the other ḥadīth texts, despite being of an earlier provenance. To date, there is only one Farsi translation of the work and no other complete English translation.[1] Since the Arabic text of this work has a number of instances where the editor has included a second form of a word or phrase in square brackets, which at times is quite different from the first one, we opted to translate only the word which seems more accurate given the context, and in cases where it is not clear which of the two is more correct, we translated the second form and included that in brackets as well. We have, however, left the Arabic text as is for those who would like to refer to the possible alternative form when it is present. We have also included some annotations in the footnotes to clarify the meaning of certain traditions, and have also included the sūrah and āyah numbers of Qurʾānic references within the traditions. Given that This is one of the earliest source texts, there is no bibliography. However, in the Arabic text of this work that we used, the editor did include footnotes wherein he mentioned the later works that referred to each of the traditions. Though the title of this work might lead one to believe that this text is all about al-zuhd or abstemiousness, it contains within it a variety of ethical teachings categorised into twenty different topics. For this we have included an appendix to explain the meaning of the term al-zuhd itself, and how it is possible that the term was understood, during certain periods, to encompass all positive ethical traits. In conclusion, we acknowledge that all mistakes in the translation are ours alone. We pray that the Almighty accept this humble effort and hope that this work will be beneficial for those who read it. And all praise belongs solely to Allah, Lord of the worlds."

Ensure that you are [always] honest, for Allah is with the one who is truthful, and turn aside from falsehood, for indeed lies take one away from faith. Know that the truthful one is close to salvation and honor, while the liar is on the brink of humiliation and destruction. Speak [only] what is good and you will be known for it, act upon it and you will become one of its folk. Return the trust to the one who entrusted it to you, and keep ties with the near of kin and turn towards them in kindness.”"

And the felicitous is he who takes admonition from [the condition of] others. The most sagacious of all is he who is Godwary while the most foolish of all is he who is morally corrupt. The worst of narrations is the false narration, and the worst of affairs are those that are innovated [in religion]. The worst blindness is the blindness of the heart, and the worst regret is when death comes to one of you. The greatest regret is the regret on the Day of Resurrection, and the greatest sin in the sight of Allah is that of a lying tongue. The worst profit is that which is earned through interest, and the worst provision is that which is consumed wrongfully from the wealth of orphans. The best adornment for a man is righteous guidance with faith, through it he acquires control of his affair and ensures a good end [to his worldly life]. He who desires renown, Allah causes him to be disgraced, and whoever relies on this world is let down [and rendered unable to attain what he seeks]. Whoever understands [the reality of] trial remains patient when faced by it, but he who does not understand it recoils [from it]. Sin is disbelief, and whoever acts arrogantly is abased by Allah. Whoever obeys Satan disobeys Allah, and whoever disobeys Allah will be punished by Him. Whoever is grateful He grants him more.” Al-Qāsim said in his narration, “Whoever bears the calamity [that befalls him] patiently, Allah will restore him [to his previous position, or better than that], and whoever puts his trust in Allah, then Allah will suffice him. Do not anger Allah for the sake of pleasing anyone among His creation, and do not [attempt to] get close to anyone among the creatures by distancing yourself from Allah, for verily there is nothing between Allah and any of His creation by which He grants him some good or repels from him something evil except through obedience to Him. Indeed, obedience to Allah is a means of successfully attaining all the good that is sought and deliverance from every evil that is dreaded. Verily Allah protects the one who obeys Him and does not protect the one who disobeys Him; and the fugitive from Allah finds no place to [which he may] escape. Certainly, the decree of Allah will come to pass even if the creatures are averse to it, and everything that approaches is near. Whatever Allah wills happens, and whatever He does not will does not happen. Assist each other in virtue and Godwariness, and do not cooperate in sin and transgression; and be mindful of Allah, indeed Allah is severe in punishment.’”"

So why do you criticise it when parting from it has been announced and the call to separate from it has been made, and it has informed [everyone] of its own death and the death of its inhabitants? Through its trial it exemplifies the trial [of the Hereafter] and through its delight it exemplifies the delight [of Paradise]. It departs with tragedy and arrives with wellbeing, as a warning, an enticement, and a frightening alarm. Hence, some people criticised it after their regret and others praised it. It reminded them, so they remembered and it spoke to them, so they accepted [its speech]. So O you who are criticising this world while being beset by its delusions, when did the world elicit your disdain and [how did it] deceive you? Was it by the abodes of your forefathers within the earth or the tombs of your mothers in the decrepit ruins? How many sick people did you tend to yourself and care for by your own hands? You would seek out a cure for him and consult physicians, yet neither did your concern benefit you, nor did you achieve what you sought.

Verily there is nothing between any one of you and that which would make him rejoice and see what gladdens and delights him except his soul reaching here…” and he made a gesture with his hand pointing to his throat (in reference to death). Then he said, “At the moment when death approaches [a person], the Messenger of Allah (ṣ), the Imams , ʿAlī , Jibraʾīl and the Angel of Death all come to him. Then Jibraʾīl draws near to him and he says to the Messenger of Allah (ṣ), ‘This person used to love you, the Ahl al- Bayt, so love him.’ So the Messenger of Allah (ṣ) says to him, ‘O Jibraʾīl, verily this individual used to love Allah and His Messenger, and the family of His Messenger, so [instruct the Angel of Death to] be gentle with him and love him.’ And Jibraʾīl in turn tells the Angel of Death, ‘This person used to love Allah and His Messenger, and the family of His Messenger, so be gentle with him and love him.’ Thus, the Angel of Death approaches the person and says, ‘O servant of Allah, you have procured your emancipation and your security [from hellfire], you have held on to the Great Protection in the life of this world.’ Then Allah, the Almighty, grants him the ability [to respond], so he replies, ‘Yes.’ So he asks, ‘What is that [Great Protection]?’ He replies, ‘The wilāyah of ʿAlī ibn Abī Ṭālib .’ So he says, ‘You are right! As for that which you used to fear, Allah has protected you from it. And as for that which you used to hope for, you have attained it. Glad tidings to you of the company of the righteous forebears, the Messenger of Allah (ṣ), ʿAlī, Fāṭimah, and the Imams from his progeny !’ Then he gently removes his soul. His shroud is then brought down from Paradise, and his embalming is a balm of fragrant musk. He is then shrouded with that shroud and embalmed with that balm. Subsequently he is dressed with a yellow attire from the apparels of Paradise. Once he is placed in his grave, Allah opens for him one of the doors of Paradise through which its breeze and fragrance reach him. Then He extends the space in front of him to the extent of a month’s travel, and to his right and left as well. He is then told, ‘Sleep as a newly-wed bride sleeps on her [soft] bed, and receive the glad tidings of ease, serenity, a blissful paradise, and a Lord who is not angry [with you]!’ Then he visits the family of the Prophet in the Gardens of delight, eating with them from their food, drinking with them from their drink, and speaking with them in their gatherings. [This will continue] until the Riser (qāʾim) from the Ahl al-Bayt rises. When our Riser rises, Allah will resurrect them so they will come together responding to his call in throngs. At that time, the followers of falsehood will doubt while those who violate the sacred will dwindle and only very few will remain. Those who seek to hasten it are destroyed and those who consider it near are saved. For this reason, the Messenger of Allah (ṣ) said to ʿAlī , ‘You are my brother, and my rendezvous with you will be at wādī al-salām.’” He said, “And when a disbeliever is on his deathbed, the Messenger of Allah (ṣ), ʿAlī , the Imams , Jibraʾīl, Mīkāʾīl, and the Angel of Death all come to him. Then Jibraʾīl draws near to him and says, ‘O Messenger of Allah, this person used to hate you, the Ahl al-Bayt, so hate him.’ So the Messenger of Allah (ṣ) says to him, O Jibraʾīl, verily this individual used to hate Allah and His Messenger, and the family of His Messenger, so [tell the Angel of Death to] hate him and be harsh with him.’ And Jibraʾīl in turn says, ‘O Angel of Death, this person used to hate Allah and His Messenger, and the family of His Messenger, so hate him and be harsh with him.’ Thus the Angel of Death approaches the person and says, ‘O servant of Allah, have you procured your emancipation and your security [from hellfire]? Have you held on to the Great Protection in the life of this world?’ He replies, ‘No.’ So he says, ‘Then receive tidings, O enemy of Allah, of the wrath of Allah, the Almighty, His chastisement and the Fire! As for what you hoped for, you have missed it, and as for what you feared, it has descended upon you.’ Then he extracts his soul violently, after which three hundred devils are assigned to remain with his soul, each of them spitting on his face and causing him discomfort. When he is placed in his grave, one of the doors of Hell is opened for him, so from it enters [into his grave] some of its stench, its [purulent] discharge, and its flames.”"

Whoever loves to meet Allah, does Allah also love to meet him? And whoever hates to meet Allah, does Allah also hate to meet him?’ He replied, ‘Yes.’ I saidBut by Allah, we surely dislike death!’ So he said, ‘It does not mean what you think. It only applies at the time of viewing [what awaits a person after death]. Verily when the believer sees what he loves [at the moment of his death], then there is nothing more beloved to him than proceeding [towards Allah], and Allah loves to meet him while he loves meeting Allah at that moment. And when he [who disbelieves] sees what he hates, then there is nothing more hateful to him than meeting Allah, the Almighty, and Allah [also] hates to meet him.’”"

Why [do you ask]?’ He said, ‘Because Mūsā spoke to his people about something that they did not accept from him, so they came out against him in Egypt and fought him, so he fought against them and killed them. And because ʿĪsā [also] spoke to his people about something that they did not accept from him, so they came out against him in Takrīt and fought him, so he fought against them and killed them. This is what is being referred to in the verse wherein Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, says: …Then a group from the Banī Isrāʾīl believed while another disbelieved. We supported the believers against their enemies, so they prevailed (Q61:14). And the first Riser who will rise from us, the Ahl al-Bayt, will [also] speak to you about something that you will not accept from him, so you will come out against him at Rumaylah al-Daskarah [1] and fight him, and he will fight you and kill you. That will be the last rebellion to ever take place. Then, O Ibn Abī Yaʿfūr, Allah will gather the first and the last. Then Muḥammad (ṣ) will be brought among the people of his time and he will be told, ‘O Muḥammad, did you convey My message and provide arguments to the people in the way I had instructed you to speak to them?’ So he will reply, ‘Yes, O Lord.’ He will then ask the people, ‘Did he convey to you [the message] and provide arguments [for it] to you?’ But the people will say, ‘No.’ So He will [again] ask Muḥammad (ṣ), and he will reply, ‘Yes [I did], O Lord.’ And Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, will already know that he had done that. He will repeat this [question] three times, after which He will accept the [truthful] answer of Muḥammad and reject the [dishonest] answer of the people. Then they will be driven to the fire of Hell. Then ʿAlī will be brought among the people of his time and he will be asked the same thing that Muḥammad (ṣ) was asked, and his people will lie about him but Allah will accept his reply and reject the lie of the people. He will repeat that thrice. Then [the same will happen with] al- Ḥasan, then al-Ḥusayn, then ʿAlī ibn al-Ḥusayn , who had the least number of companions of them all. His companions were Abū Khālid al- Kābulī, Yaḥyā ibn Umm al-Ṭawīl, Saʿīd ibn al-Musayyab, ʿĀmir ibn Wāthilah, and Jābir ibn ʿAbdillāh al-Anṣārī. These are the witnesses who will testify to the arguments he brought [to guide the people]. Then my father will be brought, meaning Muḥammad ibn ʿAlī , in the same Way. Subsequently I will be brought along with you, and I will be asked [the same question] as will you. Then see how you will respond [when that happens]. O Ibn Abī Yaʿfūr, verily Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, commands His obedience and the obedience of His Messenger, and the obedience of those in authority who are the legatees of His Messenger. O Ibn Abī Yaʿfūr, we are the proofs of Allah among His servants, His witnesses over His creation, His trustees on His earth, His custodians over His knowledge, the callers towards His path, and those who work with that [goal]. So whoever obeys us obeys Allah, and whoever disobeys us has disobeyed Allah.’”"

Therefore, I will surely give authority over them to one who will spill their blood and seize their wealth! If they cry, I will not be sympathetic to their weeping, and if they supplicate, I will not answer their supplication! They have failed, and their actions have failed. I will surely lay waste to it for a hundred years and then I will rebuild it.’ When he told them this, the scholars [among them] were alarmed and they said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, what was our sin, for we did not act the way they did? Go back to your Lord on our behalf [and ask about our fate].’ So he fasted for seven days but no revelation came to him. He then ate a little and fasted for another seven days [and then repeated this again]. When it was the twenty-first day, Allah revealed to him, ‘Go back [and turn away] from what you are doing, and do not come to Me regarding a matter that I have [already] decreed, otherwise I will certainly turn your face upon your back!’ Then Allah revealed to him that he should tell them, ‘You saw evil [being committed] but you never rejected [or forbade] it.’ He then made Nebuchadnezzar their ruler and he did with them what has reached you [in the chronicles of history].”"

So enjoin good and forbid [each other from] evil, and know that enjoining good and forbidding evil neither bring death closer nor do they sever [the means of one’s] livelihood.
