He has created the servants using His Knowledge. The tongues are dull to describe Him, and the eyes are veiled from seeing Him. It is He who is higher than the characteristics of the creatures. And He is superior to limited concepts. There is no similitude for Him among all the creatures. And there is no god for all the people other than Him. And I witness that there is no god but God - the Only, and there is no partner for Him - being a witness confessing to His Unity; inclined towards His Grace; repenting from his sins. And I witness that Muhammad is His servant and His Messenger - appointed by Him to His Prophethood, and He has entrusted him with the principle features of His religion. He has appointed him with His Book to be a proof for His servants. And I witness that Ali the son of Abi Talib is his Testamentary Trustee. He is the best of the people after him. He is in charge of his affairs. And he is a summoner to his way. And he is the Commander of the Faithful. And he is the master of the Testamentary Trustees. And he is the person of the highest priority to the Prophets. And I witness that his wife Fatimah Az-Zahra is the master of all the women in the world. And that Al-Hassan, al-Hussein and the Imams who are his offspring are the leaders to guidance . They are signs of piety and the proofs of God to all the people of the world. And I witness that whoever follows them shall be saved, and whoever disobeys them shall be ruined. May God’s Blessings and His Mercy be upon them, their souls and their bodies. Moreover, I noticed that the previous Sheikhs and scholars have already authored books on various aspects of knowledge. However, they have neglected to author a book on numbers, and good and bad characteristics. Since this topic is very useful for those who seek knowledge, I decided to compile this book in order to get closer to God, attain Divine rewards, prosperity and the Almighty God’s Mercy. I ask God not to make me hopeless since He has power over all things."

Do you say that God is One?’ The people rushed unto him and said, ‘O Bedouin! Don’t you see the condition of the Commander of the Faithful (MGB)? His mind is busy with several matters. It is not the time to ask such questions.’ The Commander of the Faithful (MGB) said, ‘Leave him alone. This Bedouin wants just what we want from this tribe.’ The Imam (MGB) then said, ‘O Bedouin! There are four meanings implied for ‘God is One.’ Two of these implications are not proper for God the Almighty, while the other two hold true. The two implications that are not proper are:1- To say that ‘He is One’ in the sense of counting in numbers. This is not proper since what has no second cannot be counted in numbers. Don’t you see that whoever says ’God is the third of the three’ is an infidel.2- To say that ‘He is One’ to imply that He is one of the people implicitly saying that He is of a type of gender. This is not proper either since it is a form of comparison while our Lord the Sublime is too great to make this (comparison).However, the two implied meanings that hold true are:3- To say that ‘He is One’ to imply that He is One and there exists nothing similar to Him. Our Lord is like this.4- To say that ‘He is One’ to imply that He, the Exalted the Sublime, is essentially One. He is not divisible in the outside world, in the mind, or in the imagination. Our Lord, the Exalted the Sublime is like this.’”"

Behold, he said to his sons: ""What will ye worship after me?"" They said, ""We shall worship Thy God and the God of thy fathers, of Abraham, Isma’il and Isaac,- the one (True) God: To Him we bow (in Islam).”In this verse God has called Ishmael who was the uncle of Jacob as his father. Likewise, the Prophet (MGB) called uncle as father. Therefore, when the Prophet (MGB) said that he (MGB) is the son of the two offerings he (MGB) is referring to Ishmael and Isaac one of whom, i.e. Ishmael was a true offering and the other one, i.e. Isaac is a virtual offering due to the fact that he wished he had been offered as a sacrifice and deserved the reward. Thus, the statement ‘I am the son of the two offerings’ can be interpreted in both ways as said above."

He wished that he had not been ordered to sacrifice a sheep instead of his son, so that he could have the feeling a father who sacrifices his dearest son with his own hands has, and could deserve the highest ranks of reward for suffering calamities. However, God the Almighty revealed to him: ""O Abraham! Who is My dearest creature for you?"" Abraham said, ""O my Lord! You have not created anyone who is dearer to me than your friend Muhammad ."" Then God the Almighty revealed to him: ""O Abraham! Do you like him more or do you like yourself more?"" He said, ""No. I like him more than I like myself."" God said, ""Do you like his child or do you like your child more?"" He said, ""Yes. His child."" God said, ""Will the oppressive beheading of his child by his enemies hurt you more, or your beheading your own child due to your obeying Me?"" He said, ""O My Lord! Of course, the beheading of his child by his enemies will hurt me more."" God said, ""O Abraham! A group of people who consider themselves to be a part of Muhammad’s (MGB) nation out of animosity and oppression will slaughter his son Hussein just like a sheep. Thus, they will deserve My wrath. Then Abraham became really sad hearing this, felt a pain in his heart and started to cry. Then the Almighty God revealed the following to him, ""O Abraham! I accepted your sorrow and sadness due to the slaughtering of Hussein instead of the sorrow you would have experienced for the sacrifice of your son Ishmael. And I will grant you the highest rewards for suffering calamities."" And this is God the Almighty’s words, ""And We ransomed him with a momentous sacrifice."""

Comfort is created in Paradise and it is for the people of Paradise. Suffering and grief have been created in this world and (they are created) for the people of this world. No one is given anything unless he has some greed for it. Whoever has more belongings in this world is more needy, since he needs the people to protect his wealth. Therefore, all the belongings in this world increase one’s needs. Thus, there is no comfort in this world. However, Satan whispers to the Children of Adam that comfort lies in collecting wealth. Thus, they are led to toil in this world and the consequent Reckoning in the Hereafter.”Then the Imam (MGB) said, “In this world the Friends of God would never overexert themselves for this world. Rather, in this world they shall strive for the Hereafter.”Then the Imam (MGB) added, “A sin will be recorded for whoever gets worried about his daily sustenance in this world. Jesus the Messiah (MGB) told his disciples, ‘This world is a bridge. Pass over it but do not build on it.’”"

When we reached Al-Juhfa, the Prophet ﷺ ordered his companions to relax. Then the people all settled down. Then they said the call to prayer and the Prophet ﷺ said two units of prayers with his companions. Then the Prophet ﷺ turned towards them and told them, ‘The Graceful, the All-Aware has informed me that I will die and so shall you. Assume that I have answered God’s call. I am held responsible to God regarding what I have delivered to you. Verily, I am leaving behind God’s Book and His Proof. You are held responsible for them. What would you tell your Lord?’ They said, ‘We will say that you fulfilled your mission, gave us advice, and strived. May God grant you the best reward on our behalf.’ Then the Prophet ﷺ asked them, 'Don’t you bear witness that there is no god but One; that I am God’s Prophet sent to you; that Paradise does exist; that Hell does exist; and that there is resurrection after death?' They replied, 'We bear witness to this.' The Prophet ﷺ said, 'May God bear witness to what you say. I take you as witnesses and bear witness that God is my Master. I am the Master of all Muslims. Is it not true that my Mastery over the believers is more than that of their own mastery over themselves? Do you believe in this? Will you bear witness to this?' They replied, 'We bear witness to this.' Then the Prophet ﷺ said, 'Whoever I am the Master of, Ali is the Master of.' Then he grabbed Ali’s hand and raised it up along with his own hand in such a way that both their underarms could be seen. Then the Prophet ﷺ said, 'O my God! Please be the friend of his friends and be the enemy of his enemies. Assist whoever assists him, and abandon whoever abandons him. I shall leave and you will meet me again at the Heavenly Pool later. That is a Pool whose width expands from Bosra to Sana'a. There are as many silver goblets in it as there are stars in the sky. Then I shall question you about what you bear witness to today when I meet you at my Pool. I will ask you what you did with the Two Heavy Things and how you dealt with what I left behind when you meet me.' They said, 'O Messenger of God! What are the Two Heavy Things?' The Prophet ﷺ replied, 'The greater of the Two Heavy Things is the Book of the Honorable the Exalted God. It is a means that is extended from God and I towards you. One side of it is in the Hand of God and the other side is in your hands. The knowledge of the past and what is yet to come up until the arrival of the Hour is in it. And the smaller of the Two Heavy Things is equal to the Quran: It is Ali ibn Abi Talib and his Household. These Two will be inseparable until they come to me at the Heavenly Pool.'"""

The Prophets (MGB) did not consider them to be ill omen as the Honorable the Exalted God said regarding the people of the Prophet Salih, They said, ‘Ill omen do we augur from thee and those that are with thee’. He said, ‘Your ill omen is with God.’” And as others have told their Prophets (MGB), “for us, we augur an evil omen from you: if ye desist not, we will certainly stone you. And a grievous punishment indeed will be inflicted on you by us."" And regarding envy here is that the Prophets are envied. They do not envy others as the Honorable the Exalted God says, “Or do they envy mankind for what God hath given them of his bounty? but We had already given the people of Abraham the Book and Wisdom, and conferred upon them a great kingdom.”And regarding deluding thoughts about creation refers to the fact that the Prophets (MGB) encounter people who are fastidious in their thoughts. An example of this is what the Honorable the Exalted God describes about al-Walid ibn al-Muqayrih al-Makhzoomi (in the following verses of the Holy Quran), “For he thought and he plotted; And woe to him! How he plotted! Yea, Woe to him; How he plotted!” This means that he had said the following about the Quran, “This is nothing but magic, derived from of old; This is nothing but the word of a mortal!”"

Umar order that she be stoned to death. They took her to Ali ibn Abi Talib (MGB). The Imam (MGB) asked, ‘What is going on?’ They said, ‘She is a crazy woman who has committed adultery. Umar has ordered her to be punished.’ The Imam (MGB) said, ‘Do not rush to do so.’ Then the Imam (MGB) told Umar, ‘Don’t you know that three people are not subject to the rules? They are children until they mature, crazy people until they become sane, and people who are asleep until they wake up.”The compiler of the book - may God be pleased with him - said, “This tradition appeared here this way. The original version of this tradition that has been narrated on the authority of the Divine Leaders (MGB) says, ‘When an insane man commits adultery, he should be punished. However, when an insane woman commits adultery, she should not be punished. That is because an insane man does the act (of adultery), while an insane woman would be the subject (of adultery).”"

Which of you will rise against the three people who have sworn to Lat and Uzza to kill me? By the Lord of the Ka’ba! They have lied!’ The people all looked down and no one said anything. The Prophet (MGB) said, ‘I think Ali ibn Abi Talib (MGB) is not amongst you?’ Amir ibn Qatada said, ‘He (MGB) had a fever at night and did not come out to pray with you. Will you permit me to inform him?’ The Prophet (MGB) said, ‘Go and do so.’He went and informed Ali (MGB). Then the Commander of the Faithful Ali (MGB) came out while he (MGB) had tied the two corners of his robe to his neck. He said, ‘O Prophet of God! What has happened?’ The Prophet (MGB) said, ‘My Lord has informed me that there are three people who have risen up to kill me, but I swear by the Lord of the Ka’ba that they have lied.’Then the Commander of the Faithful Ali (MGB) said, ‘I will get ready and go to fight with them by myself.’ Then the Prophet (MGB) said, ‘Fine. Here is my garment, my armor, and my sword.’ The Prophet (MGB) dressed him, put on his own armor on Ali (MGB), gave Ali (MGB) his own sword and put his own turban on Ali’s head. The Commander of the Faithful (MGB) rode his horse and left. Three days passed. Gabriel did not bring any news about Ali (MGB) and there was no other news about him. Fatimah (MGB) brought forth Al-Hassan (MGB) and Al-Hussein (MGB) and said, ‘I hope you have not made these boys orphans!’ The Prophet (MGB) cried and said, ‘I give the glad tidings of Paradise for whoever brings me any news about Ali (MGB).’ The people who were present there started to look around. Then Amir ibn Qatada returned with the news of Ali’s (MGB) return. Then the Commander of the Faithful (MGB) came back with two slaves, three camels and three horses. Gabriel descended to the Prophet (MGB) and informed the Prophet (MGB) about what had happened. The Prophet (MGB) said, ‘O Abal-Hassan ! Do you want me to tell you what happened?’ Then the hypocrites said, ‘So far Muhammad was in great pains wondering about Ali’s whereabouts and now he wants to tell us what has happened to Ali (MGB)!’Then the Prophet (MGB) said, ‘O Abal-Hassan (Ali)! You yourself tell us what happened to you so that you be the witness for these people.’ Ali (MGB) said, ‘O Prophet of God! Yes. Once I got there I found these three people riding on camels. They yelled at me and asked me who I am. I replied, ‘I am the cousin of God’s Prophet!’ They said, ‘We do not know who God’s Prophet is. To us killing you and Muhammad is the same.’ Then this man who was killed attacked me and we had a fight. Then there came a red wind in which I could hear your voice saying, ‘I have cut off the neck of his armour for you. Hit him at the neck!’ I hit him at the neck, but it did not work. Then a black wind started to blow and I heard your voice saying‘I have raised his armour!’ I hit him on the leg and chopped it off. Then I threw him on the ground and chopped off his head. Then the other two said, ‘We have heard that Muhammad is a kind and sympathetic friend. Please do not rush in killing us and take us to him. This friend of ours equaled one-thousand fighters.’ Then the Prophet (MGB) said, ‘The first voice was that of Gabriel, and the second one was that of Michael.’ Then the Prophet (MGB) turned to one of the two men and said, ‘Say ‘There is no god but God, and I bear witness that you are God’s Prophet.’’The man replied, ‘It is easier for me to carry Mount Abi Qays on my shoulders than to say this. The Prophet (MGB) said, ‘Then chop off his head.’ They brought forth the other man. The Prophet (MGB) said, ‘Say ‘There is no god but God, and I bear witness that you are God’s Prophet.’’The man said, ‘Let me join my friend.’ The Prophet (MGB) said, ‘O Abal-Hassan (Ali)! Chop off his head.’ The Commander of the Faithful (MGB) got up to chop off the man’s head. However, Gabriel descended and said, ‘O Muhammad! Your Lord sends you greetings and says ‘Thou shall not kill him since he is good-tempered and kind with his tribe.’ The man who was under the sword asked, ‘Is this the messenger from your Lord who is informing you?’ The Prophet (MGB) said, ‘Yes.’ The man said, ‘I swear by God that I never withheld even a penny from my brethren and I never fled from war. Now I bear witness that there is no god but God and that you are His Messenger.’ The Prophet (MGB) said, ‘This is a man whose generosity and being good-tempered will take him to Paradise.’”"

There are many people who engage themselves in things similar to what we engage in until their time of death arrived and they suffered from a great loss. They left this world in a state of being sorry since they had not hesitated to do bad deeds and had not taken anything for their Hereafter. Those who would not be grateful divided up all the inheritance which they had left behind in this world, but they had to go to Him who would not accept any excuses! It would be advisable to review the affairs of this world and avoid doing wicked deeds. Fear God and be determined to do two things. First try to take some good deeds with you which would be with you when you face your Lord. Secondly, abstain from evil deeds and do not takewith you something which will cause you to be sorry when you face your Lord. O Umar! Fear God the Honorable the Exalted! Open the door and raise the curtain (to let the people in to see you). Assist the oppressed ones and defeat the oppressors.”Then the Imam (MGB) added, “There are three things which would perfect one’s belief in God.”Once Umar heard this, he sat down on his knees and asked, “O Member of the Holy Household of the Prophet! What are they?”The Imam (MGB) said, “Yes, Umar! That is that once you are pleased, your pleasure doesn’t cause you to engage in wrongful deeds. Also once you are angry, your anger would not lead you to do what is not rightful, and once you are powerful, you do not devour what is not yours.”Then Umar asked for ink and a quill and wrote, ‘In the Name of God the Compassionate the Merciful.

There are signs for everything by which they are known and which indicate those things. There are three signs for religion which are knowledge, faith and acting accordingly. There are three signs for knowledge which are knowledge of God, knowledge of what God likes and what God disapproves of. There are three signs for faith which are faith in God, His Book and His Messenger. There are also three signs for acting accordingly which are praying, fasting and paying the alms-tax. There are three signs for one who is a show-off which are quarrelling with ones who are better; speaking out of ignorance; and seeking what is extremely hard to find. There are three signs for the oppressor which are oppressively harming those who are superior; being forceful with those who are inferior; and helping those who are oppressors. There are three signs for the corrupt which are constant disagreement between what he says and what is in his heart; constant disagreement between his heart and his deeds; and constant disagreement between his outward appearance and his inward thoughts. There are three signs for the sinner which are he is treacherous, he lies and he acts opposite to what he says. There are three signs for the show-off which are he is lazy, but he acts as if he is steadfast in public and he always seeks to be praised.There are three signs for the haughty which are he blames others in their absence; he boastfully praises others in front of them; and he blames the events which bring about calamities. There are three signs for the wasteful which are he buys what he doesn’t deserve to have; he wears what he doesn’t deserve to wear; and he eats what he doesn’t deserve to eat. There are three signs for the lazy which are he is so sluggish that he starts to commit criminal acts; he has shortcomings that lead him to being ungrateful; and he wastes things so much that he becomes a criminal. There are three signs for the ignorant which are inattentiveness, playfulness and forgetfulness.” Hammad ibn Isa added that Aba Abdullah as-Sadiq (MGB) said, “For each of these signs there are more than a thousand indications. O Himad! Seek knowledge during the day and the night. Stop being greedy for what others possess, if you wish to be able to see the good in this world and attain the Eternal Abode. Consider yourself to be amongst the dead. Do not consider yourself to be superior to anyone else. Keep your mouth shut and keep your aspirations to yourself.”"

One who is weak in Certitude and whose belief about the provision of his sustenance is weak can be reassured considering the three occasions on which God the Blessed the Sublime would take care of his affairs and provide for his sustenance, while he is not able to do anything and cannot earn his sustenance. The first occasion is during the time he is in his mother’s womb where he has no power to do anything, but God provides his sustenance and maintains him in a safe and stable place where he is protected against heat and cold. The second occasion is after he is born and has no power to do anything, but is fed with his mother’s milk until he grows up and stops being breastfed. The third occasion is after he is no longer being breastfed and has no power to do anything but God provides his sustenance through his father’s earnings and by the love He has placed in his father’s heart, such that he always puts a higher priority to feeding and clothing him than he does to feeding and clothing himself. Then once a man grows up he goes out to work to provide for his sustenance. Whenever he has shortcomings and cannot earn enough, he forgets this and is badly suspicious about God the Blessed the Sublime providing his sustenance and makes life hard for his spouse and children. O my son! Such a person would be a bad worshipper!’”"

There are three things lacking which means nothing of what you do is perfected: piety which prevents you from disobeying the Honorable the Exalted God; good temper which assists him to treat the people with moderation and patience which helps him forgive the ignorance of the people. O Ali! Three things are due to real faith: generosity in spite of poverty; recognizing that others are right regarding oneself and teaching knowledge to its seekers. O Ali! Three characteristics are due to nobility: giving to those who have denied things of you; associating with those who have cut-off ties from you and forgiving those who have oppressed you.’”"

There are three things with which whoever visits God he will be of the noblest of the people. Whoever performs whatever is incumbent upon him would be of the best of the worshippers. Whoever abstains from whatever is forbidden for him to do would be of the most pious ones and whoever is content with whatever sustenance God has provided for him would be of the most needless ones.O Ali! There are three things which my followers find it hard to do: being sympathetic with their brethren during times of being wealthy; being fair with others regarding themselves and remembering God at all times. This doesn’t mean saying God’s glorifications by saying ‘Subhanallah valhamdulilah va la illaha ilallaho allaho akbar!’ No. It means to fear the Honorable the Exalted God whenever you run across a forbidden deed and abstain from doing that forbidden deed. O Ali! There is fear of insanity in three deeds: sleeping in the graveyard; walking wearing only one shoe and sleeping alone. O Ali! Associating with three groups of people will spoil the heart: associating with mean people, associating with the rich people and talking with women. O Ali! Three things would strengthen memory and fend off ailments: drinking milk; brushing the teeth and reciting the Quran. O Ali! The following three acts are due to obsession: eating clay, biting one’s nails, and chewing one’s beard. O Ali! I admonish you against three characteristics: envy, greed and haughtiness. O Ali! There are three things which would make the heart perish: listening to vain talk; going hunting, and going to the door of the king’s palace. O Ali! Life depends on three things: big house, beautiful woman, and a slim horse.’”The compiler of the book - may God increase his honor - said, “A slim horse is a thin horse whether male or female.”"

I have never seen anyone pray like this.’ I replied, ‘I have learned it from the (grand)son of God’s Prophet (MGB).’ The man asked, ‘Is he knowledgeable?’ I replied, ‘Yes.’ The man said, ‘Then ask him about the following three things: what eggs, fish and birds are forbidden to eat?’ I went on Hajj pilgrimage that year and went to see Aba Abdullah as-Sadiq (MGB) and told him, ‘A man has asked me three things.” He (MGB) said, “What are they?” I said, “He asked me which eggs, fish and birds are forbidden to eat?” The Imam (MGB) replied, “You should not eat any eggs whose tips are the same (the top of which you cannot distinguish from its bottom). You should not eat fish which has no scales. You should not eat any birds which do not have any gizzards” Upon my return from Mecca, I went to see the Christian man and gave him the answer.

When the number of his sons became ten with the birth of Abdullah - the father of God’s Prophet Muhammad (MGB) - it was hard for Abdul Mutalib to offer Abdullah as a sacrifice. Then he brought ten camels and cast lots for either them or Abdullah. The lot fell to Abdullah’s name. He increased the numberof the camels to be offered ten by ten and repeated the casting of lots. However, every time the lot fell to Abdullah’s name. When the number of camels he offered reached one-hundred, the lot fell in the name of the camels. Abdul Mutalib said, ‘O My Lord! No. It would not be fair to suffice for this. I must draw lots three more times.’ He drew lots three more times. The lot fell to the name of the camels all three times. At this time Abdul Mutalib said, ‘Now I know that my Lord is pleased with this.” And he had their throats cut."

However, they are done based upon God’s Decrees, Power, Predetermination, Volition and Knowledge. That is why God punishes us for committing them.”The compiler of the book - may God be pleased with him - said, “When it is said that sins are done based upon God’s Decrees, it implies that God has admonished us against doing them, since the Honorable the Exalted God’s Decrees for His servants regarding sins is to abandon them. What is meant by ‘it is based upon God’s Predetermination’ is that God knows the sin’s amount and extent. What is meant by ‘it is based upon God’s Volition’ means that the Honorable the Exalted God only hinders him from committing sins by means of advice, statements, forbidding and admonishment - not by force and use of power.”"

His wage was a cup of rice which he entrusted me with and went somewhere. I planted it and it grew. I bought a herd of cows with what I harvested. When he returned to me and asked for his cup of rice I told him, ‘Here you go. Look at this herd of cows. Take them. O God! You well know that I did that due to fearing You. So please open the rocks for us. Then the rock opened up a little. The second one said, ‘O my God! You well know that I had old parents. I took goat’s milk for them every night. One night I was late and they had fallen asleep when I arrived. I could not give them any goat milk to drink. I did not want to wake them up to drink. I also feared that if I return, they might wake up to drink their milk and not find me there. Therefore, I stayed up all night until they woke up at dawn to drink their milk. You know that I did that due to fearing You. Then please open the rocks for us.’ Then the rock opened up a little bit more such that they could see the sky. The third one said, ‘O my God! You know that I had a niece whom I loved the most. I wanted to make love to her. She refused and made a condition for me to give her one-hundred Dinars. I worked hard and earned that one-hundred Dinars. I took the money to her and gave it to her. She let me in.

Then please open the rocks for us.’ Then the Honorable the Exalted God opened up the rocks for them and they left the cave.”"

He sat down. I sat down, too. Then he (MGB) raised his head up and told me, ‘O Komayl! Remember what I will tell you. The people are in three groups: divine scholars; students seeking to be saved; and the pests in the air which fly in whichever direction the wind blows. They are the ones who have not benefitted from any rays of knowledge and have not sought refuge in any strong base. O Komayl! Knowledge is better than wealth. Knowledge will guard you, but you must guard your wealth. Wealth will be reduced once spent, but knowledge will increase when it is spread. O Komayl! Expressing love by the students for the scholars is in return for what they have borrowed from them (i.e. their knowledge). Students must obey their teachers for as long as they are alive and should honor their names after their death. There will be no return of wealth once it is lost. O Komayl! Those who hoard up wealth are the living dead! The scholars are the ones who are alive. They shall even survive after their death to the end of time. Their bodies shall perish, but their teachings shall be living in the people’s hearts. Yes, there exists in here (while he was pointing to his heart) an endless treasure of knowledge. I wish I could find good students who deserved to receive it. I have a student who learns it, but is not trustworthy. He uses the religion as a tool to gain worldly benefits. He oppresses the servants of God using God’s Proofs and overcomes them using God’s Blessings. He does so to gather the weak and uneducated people around himself to support him, and oppose the true Friend of God. I have another student who is a sincere follower of his teacher, but he is not wise enough to be able to retain his knowledge. He starts to doubt things with the slightest bit of doubt in his heart. I have another student who is neither like the former nor like the latter. However, he delves into pleasure-seeking. He is extremely lustful and in love with worldly treasures. Neither of these can propagate the religion. They are more or less like the four-legged animals. Therefore, knowledge will vanish upon the death of the one who possesses it. I swear by God that the Earth shall not be left void of God’s Proof . It will either be apparent, but oppressed by the oppressors, hidden behind curtains, on deep waves and invisible to the eyes so that God’s Proofs and His Clear Signs do not get destroyed.How many of them are there? They are small in number, but are always of the highest rank. It is through them that God will retain His Proofs and Clear Signs so that they may entrust them to worthy men like themselves; and can foster them in the hearts of those who are similar to themselves. They have delved deeply into the affairs of the world and have attained the utmost level of certitude. What is extremely difficult for the lovers of this world is easy for them. They are accustomed to what the illiterate ones evade. Their bodies are in this world, but their souls are eager for the heavens. O Komayl! Your masters are God’s successors and the ones who invite others to His Religion. O I am very eager to see them. I beseech God’s forgiveness for both you and I.”The compiler of this book - may God be pleased with him - said, “I have reported this tradition in many various ways in the book Kamal ad-Din wa Itamam an-Ne’mat Fi Isbat al-Qaybat va Kashf al-Hayrat.”"

أشك في ديني؟ أم حيرة في سجيتي؟ أم ضن بنفسي؟وأما ما ذكرت من خذلان عثمان، فقد خذله من كان أمس رحما به مني ولي في الاقربين والابعدين اسوة، وإني لم أعد عليه فيمن عدا بل كففت عنه كما كف أهل المروات والحجىوأما ما ذكرت من سعيي على عائشة فان الله تعالى أمرها أن تقر في بيتها وتحتجب بسترها فلما كشفت جلباب الحياء وخالفت نبيها صلى الله عليه وآله، وسعنا ما كان منا إليهاوأما ما ذكرت من نفي زياد، فاني لم أنفه بل نفاه رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله إذ قال: ""الولد للفراش وللعاهر الحجر."" وإني من بعد هذا لاحب ما سرك في جميع اموركفتكلم عمرو بن العاص فقال: يا أمير المؤمنين والله ما أحبك ساعة قط غير أنه قد اعطي لسانا ذربا فقلبه كيف شاء، وإن مثلك ومثله كما قال الاول وذكر بيت شعر فقال ابن عباس إن عمرا داخل بين العظم واللحم والعصا واللحاء وقد تكلم فليستمع فقد وافق قرنا. أما والله يا عمرو إني لابغضك في الله وما أعتذر منه، إنك قمت خطيبا فقلت: أنا شانئ محمد، فأنزل الله عز وجل ""إن شانئك هو الابتر"" فأنت أبتر الدين والدنيا، وأنت شانئ محمد في الجاهلية والاسلام، وقد قال الله تبارك وتعالى: ""لا تجد قوما يؤمنون بالله واليوم الآخر يوادون من حاد الله ورسوله"" وقد حاددت الله ورسوله قديما وحديثا ولقد جهدت على رسول الله جهدك، وأجلبت عليه بخيلك ورجلك حتى إذا غلبك الله على أمرك ورد كيدك في نحرك وأوهن قوتك وأكذب احدوثتك، نزعت وأنت حسير، ثم كدت بجهدك لعداوة أهل بيت نبيه من بعده ليس بك في [ذلك] حب معاوية ولا آل معاوية إلا العداوة لله عز وجل ولرسوله صلى الله عليه وآله مع بغضك وحسدك القديم لابناء عبد مناف ومثلك في ذلك كما قال الاول :تعرض لي عمرو وعمرو خزايةتعرض ضبع القفر للاسد الوردفما هو لي ند فأشتم عرضهولا هو لي عبد فأبطش بالعبدفتكلم عمرو بن العاص، فقطع عليه معاوية، وقال: أما والله يا عمرو ما أنت من رجاله فان شئت فقل وإن شئت فدعفاغتنمها عمرو وسكت، فقال ابن عباس: دعه يا معاوية فوالله لاسمنه بميسم يبقى عليه عاره وشناره إلى يوم القيامه تتحدث به الاماء والعبيد ويتغنى به في المجالس ويتحدث به في المحافل، ثم قال ابن عباس: يا عمرو وابتدأ في الكلام، فمد معاوية يده فوضعها على في ابن عباس، وقال له: أقسمت عليك يا ابن عباس إلا أمسكت، وكره أن يسمع أهل الشام ما يقول ابن عباس، وكان آخر كلامه: اخسأ أيها العبد وأنت مذموم، وافترقوا","4-35 Ali ibn Ahmad ibn Musa - may God be pleased with him - narrated that Ahmad ibn Yahya ibn Zakariya al-Qattan quoted Abu Muhammad Bakr ibn Abdullah ibn Habib, on the authority of Al-Ab’bas ibn al-Faraj, on the authority of Abu Salmat al-Qaffari, on the authority of Abdullah ibn Ibrahimibn Abi Forut, on the authority of Abdul Malik ibn Marvan, “Once I was with Muawiyah and a group of the people from the Quraysh tribe were there. Some of the Hashemites were among them. Muawiyah said, “O Hashemites! Why do you think you are better than us while we both come from the same father and mother, and we both come from the same family and country?”Ibn Abbas said, “We say we are better than you for the same reason that you say you are better than the Quraysh, and the Quraysh say they are better than the Helpers (Ansar), and the Helpers (Ansar) say they are better than the Arabs, and the Arabs say they are better than the non-Arabs. That is we are proud because of God’s Prophet (MGB). You can neither deny this nor escape from this fact.”Muawiyah said, “O Ibn Abbas! You have been granted such a convincing tongue with which you press your false accusations over the truth.”Ibn Abbas said, “Shut up! Indeed falsehood can never overcome the truth. Quit being jealous as jealousy is bad.”Muawiyah said, “You spoke the truth. I swear by God that I like you for four characteristics and I forgive you for four deeds. The four reasons I like you for are: First of all I like you because of your close relationship to God’s Prophet (MGB). The second reason is that you are a man from my family and from the pure race of Abd Manaf. The third reason is that my father was friends with your father. The fourth reason is that you are the speaker for the Quraysh tribe and you are their learned man. And your four deeds which I forgive you for are: your taking part in the Battle of Siffin along with those who attacked me; your ugly act being not assisting Uthman against the rebels who attacked him, and your attempts against Ayesha , plus your rejection of Zyad being my step-brother.When I considered your wicked deeds in detail, I found an excuse for your deeds from the Book of the Honorable the Exalted God and one from Arab poems. Your excuse based on the Book (Quran) comes from the following verse, ‘Others (there are who) have acknowledged their wrong-doings: they have mixed an act that was good with another that was evil. Perhaps Allah will turn unto them (in Mercy): for Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.’ Your excuse based on Arab poems comes from the words of the Zebyan tribe who said, ‘Which of your brothers can you find free of faults. You will be left without any friends if you cut off relations for small faults.’ You should know that I have recognized your four good characteristics and have forgiven your four deeds as the poet said, ‘I accept good deeds from my loved ones. I forgive them for whatever else they may have done.’”When he finished, Ibn Abbas started to respond by first reciting God’s praises and glorifications. Then he said, ‘You mentioned that you like me because I am close to God’s Prophet (MGB). This is incumbent upon you and all Muslims who believe in God and His Prophet (MGB), since this love is the reward which God’s Prophet (MGB) asked for in return for what he brought you in terms of illumination and clear reasoning. The Honorable the Exalted God says, ‘…Say: ""No reward do I ask of you for this except the love of those near of kin.’ Whoever doesn’t follow this verse and doesn’t love his near of kin is going to be hopeless, without honor and in Hell.You mentioned that you like me because I am a man from your family. Well, that is right. You wanted to perform your duty and visit your relations of kin. You seem to be doing a lot of that these days. You are not to be blamed today for your past mistakes.You mentioned that you like me because my father was friends with your father. That is right and it is certified by what the poet said about it:I will strive to be loyal to my friend for as long as he is aliveAnd shall do so with his relatives should he die and I stay aliveWhoever honors not his pledge, I shall not trustSince then he shall not pacify my swollen heart.You mentioned that you like me because I am the speaker for the Quraysh tribe and I am their learned man. You likewise have a similar rank. However, you are so noble as to mention me to be of such a rank. This is also supported by what the poet said about it:Noble ones set other ones up higher than themselvesThey honor others though they are nobler themselvesYou mentioned my animosity with you, since I attacked you at Siffin. By God, I would have been amongst the worst creatures in the world had I not done so. O Muawiyah! How could you even imagine that I would abandon my cousin Ali - the Commander of the Faithful and the Master of the Muslims - who was supported by the Emigrants (Muhajerin), the Helpers (Ansar), and the cream of the crop of the freedom-lovers, and join you! O Muawiyah! Then I would have serious doubts about my faith in my religion, my moral constitution and myself.You mentioned that I abandoned Uthman. Well, even those who were much closer to him abandoned him and left. I followed his close associates and those who were not so close to him. I never assisted the rebels who revolted against him. I just abandoned him. You mentioned my effort made against Ayesha . You know that she had been ordered by the Sublime God’s Prophet (MGB) to stay behind the veil at home, but she tore the veil, left her house and opposed the Prophet (MGB). The way we treated with her was appropriate.You mentioned my rejection of your step-brotherhood with Zyad. However, this was not my denial but the Prophet’s denial since he (MGB) has said, ‘the offspring belongs to the owner of the bed and the fornicatress gets stoned.’ Now I like to do what would please you, whatever it may be.’Then Amr Ibn Al-A’as started to talk and said, ‘O commander of the faithful (referring to Muawiyah!) By God, he doesn’t like you and just wants to fool you into thinking that he agrees with you using his sharp tongue. He cited the poems to support this.’Then Ibn Abbas said, ‘Indeed Amr put himself to great trouble. He should now know that he is facing a strong opponent.’Then Ibn Abbas added, ‘O Amr! I swear by God that I am opposed to you for the sake of God and I shall not apologize for that. You had said, ‘I hate Muhammad.’ The Honorable the Exalted God revealed, ‘For he who hateth thee, he will be cut off (from Future Hope).’You have been cut off from the religion and the world. You even hated Muhammad in the Age of Ignorance!Indeed the Blessed the Sublime God says, ‘Thou wilt not find any people who believe in Allah and the Last Day, loving those who resist Allah and His Messenger…’ Indeed you have always resisted God and God’s Prophet (MGB). You did whatever you could against the Prophet of God (MGB). You gathered all your forces - on foot or riding - against the Prophet (MGB) until God defeated you, hanged up your sign of deception around your neck, reduced your strength and rejected your way. That is why you turned around and changed your approach and re-directed your plans of animosity with the members of the Holy Household of the Prophet (MGB). Therefore, you united with Muawiyah for this goal. However, you should know that love for the household of Muawiyah and no others is nothing but animosity with the Honorable the Exalted God and His Prophet (MGB). You still have your old animosity with and jealousy of the progeny of Abd Manaf as the poet says,Amr blamed me but he himself was debasedNear a male lion he turned into a weak hyenaHe doesn’t equal me so I shall not fight himHe is not my servant so I can’t punish him!Amr Ibn Al-A’as wanted to reply but Muawiyah stopped him and said, ‘O Amr! I swear by God that you cannot match him. It would be best for you to stop it.’Amr Ibn Al-A’as used this opportunity and became silent. Ibn Abbas said, ‘O Muawiyah! Please I beseech by God! Please let him start talking. Then I shall debase him so much that the masters and the slaves cite his case and restate his story in meetings and parties up until the Resurrection Day.’Then Ibn Abbas started to speak and said, ‘O Amr!’ However, Muawiyah put his hand on Ibn Abbas’s mouth and said, ‘O Ibn Abbas! I swear to you to finish this since I do not like the Syrians to hear this speech.’ Then Ibn Abbas told Amr, ‘O blameworthy servant! Get lost.’ Then they left.”"

One day I asked him about the Immaculateness of a Divine Leader. I asked him, ‘Is a Divine Leader Immaculate?’ He replied, ‘Yes, he is.’ I asked him, ‘What does that imply and how can we tell?’ He replied, ‘Indeed all sins are due to the following four (and there is no fifth reason): greed, jealousy, anger, and lustful desires. None of these exist in a Divine Leader. A Divine Leader cannot be greedy toward this world, since greediness arises from poverty and all the world is under the Imam’s ring and he is the treasurer of the Muslims in this respect. So why should he be greedy? A Divine Leader cannot be jealous, since man would be jealous of what is above him, not what is lower than him. However, there is no one higher than a Divine Leader. So how could he be jealous of anyone who is lower than himself? A Divine Leader cannot get angry at any worldly affairs unless it be for what angers the Honorable the Exalted God. The Honorable the Exalted God has made him responsible to establish the limits. Therefore, it is natural for him to get angry at those who blame him for doing so, and be nice to some regarding their religion so as to uphold the Honorable the Exalted God’s established limits. A Divine Leader cannot follow lusts since he has already preferred the Hereafter over this world. Indeed, the Honorable the Exalted God has shown him the preferable attributes of the Hereafter just as we see the preferable attributes of this world. He looks at the Hereafter the way we look at this world. So how could he then prefer this world over the Hereafter? How could one abandon looking at a beautiful face and look at an ugly face instead? How could one pick a bad tasting dish instead of a delicious one? How could one prefer a rough attire over a soft one? How could one abandon the everlasting blessings of the Hereafter for the ephemeral pleasures of this world?’”"

The Imam (MGB) said, ‘O Mansoor! Anyone who has gone on Hajj pilgrimage for four times will never bear the pressures of the grave. Once he dies, his visits to the Ka’ba will appear to him to be the most beautiful people in his grave and will pray in the corner of his grave until the Resurrection Day, while he will be rewarded for these prayers. You should know that the reward of each unit of these prayers would equal the reward of one-thousand units of prayers said by men.’”"

There are four pillars of perseverance: courage, fear, piety, and awaiting. Anyone who is eager for Paradise will not be entrapped in lust. Anyone who fears Hell will abstain from committing forbidden acts. Calamities will be easy to bear for anyone who is pious in this world. Anyone who awaits death will attempt to do good deeds.There are four pillars of certitude: intelligence; foresight; wisdom; preaching lessons; and ways of the people of the past. One who is intelligent would have foresight. One who is wise would recognize things from which he can learn. One who recognizes things from which he can learn would learn the right approach. One who learns the right approach it is as if he is living with the experiences of the people of the past.There are four pillars for justice: deep understanding, thorough knowledge, good insight and great wisdom. One who understands deeply would explain the knowledge beautifully. One who has thorough knowledge would make acceptable decisions and one who is wise would not neglect anything and live admirably amongst the people.There are four pillars of struggling in the way of God: enjoining to do good; forbidding evil; persistence at the war front; and hating the corrupt people. One who enjoins to do so strengthens the back of the believers. One who forbids from evil, defeats the hypocrites. One who persists at the war front has done his duty. One who hates the corrupt people and the Honorable the Exalted God’s Wrath would also raise his wrath. This is belief, its pillars and its kinds. This is faith, its pillars and its various types.Atheism is founded on the following four: corruption; tyranny; doubt and dubiosity.There are four pillars of corruption: oppression, blind-heartedness, ignorance, and rebellion.One who is oppressive would belittle the truth; consider knowledgeable ones as his enemies, and insist on committing major sins. One who is blind-hearted would forget God, would follow his suspicions and be defeated by Satan. One who is ignorant would be fooled by high aspirations and would feel sorry when he realizes that these were just mirages. One who is rebellious would be debased by God through God’s Dominion and Majesty since he turns away from God and rebels against the decrees of his Noble Lord.There are four pillars of tyranny: pickiness; causing conflicts; mental aberration and causing discord.One who is picky would not adhere to the right. He would only get more drowned in problems. He is always entrapped in seditions and would be deviated away from the religion and would wander about in trouble aimlessly.One who causes conflicts and fights others would lose his ties with others. He would be in real trouble. Good things will turn into bad for him. Bad things will turn into good. Such people would not be able to find the right way, and it would become hard for them to find their way out. They would turn away from the religion and follow a path other than that which the believers follow.There are four pillars for doubt: fear; distrust; hesitation and surrendering. One who bases his religion on doubt would not be able to even sleep until the morning. ‘O those who dispute! ‘Then which of the gifts of thy Lord, (O man,) wilt thou dispute about?’ One who fears what is ahead of him would fall over. One who hesitates in doubt would fall behind others. They will overpass him and would be destroyed under the feet of the devils. One who surrenders would be destroyed between the affairs of this world and the next. Whoever adheres to certitude shall survive. There are four pillars for dubiosity: selfishness; fooling oneself;improper thoughts; and decorating what is indeed wrong in order to make it look right. This is how by selfishness one blocks off what is right. One who fools himself would be entrapped in the fire of lust. Improper thoughts would greatly harm one. Decorating what is wrong to look like right would cover up things with many layers of darkness. These were the various categories of atheism, its foundations and its various types. Hypocrisy is founded upon four things: selfishness, light-headedness, animosity and greed.There are four pillars for selfishness: trespassing, animosity, lust and rebellion. One who trespasses would be in a lot of trouble. He would never be calm. One who doesn’t control lust would wade in ice. One who rebels would undoubtedly go astray.And the various types of light-headedness are: sluggishness, being deceived, postponing deeds to a later time and having great expectations. One who acts sluggishly will not act according to God’s religion. One who postpones the deeds will put them off until he dies. If man did not have any great expectations, he would act according to his duties. If man doesn’t know his duties, he would badly die in fear. There are four types of animosity: haughtiness; pride; supporting one side; and being biased. One who is haughty would fall behind. One who is too proud would become corrupt. One who supports one side would be insisting on sins. One who is biased would be wicked. And greed can be classified into the following four categories: undue happiness and cheerfulness, stubbornness and hoarding up. Undue happiness and cheerfulness are not pleasant in the sight of the Honorable the Exalted God. Stubbornness is an evil thing which would entrap one in sins. Hoarding up would imply changing what could be useful into what is bad. These were the various categories of hypocrisy, its foundations and its various types."

Does the Prophet (MGB) give women any share of the booties?2- Who is the alms-tax given to?3- When is an orphan considered to be a grown-up?4- What about killing the children of atheists?Ibn Abbas replied, “Regarding what you asked, God’s Prophet (MGB) let women benefit from the booties, but it was not considered as a share. We believe that the alms-tax should be given to us, but some people think that it doesn’t belong to us. Therefore we are patient. An orphan is considered to have grown up when he attains sexual maturity, unless he is retarded or foolish. In such conditions, his custodian would be in charge of his belongings. The Prophet of God would not kill any of the children of the atheists. It was Khizr who killed the atheists and let go of the believers of the children of the atheists. You may act accordingly, if you possess the knowledge which Khizr possessed.”"

I have heard from Salman, Miqdad and Abuzar some interpretations (of the Quran) and traditions from the Prophet (MGB) which differ with what is in the hands of the people. Then I heard that you acknowledged what I had heard from the people. There are many things in the hands of the people including interpretations of the Quran and traditions of the Prophet (MGB) with which you disagree and consider invalid. Do you think that the people falsely ascribe these traditions to God’s Prophet (MGB) and interpret the Quran as they wish?’ Then Ali (MGB) faced me and said, ‘You asked. Now try to understand the answer. In fact, what exists in the hands of the people includes truth and falsehood; right and wrong; etc.During the Prophet’s lifetime, they ascribed so many lies to him that he was forced to stand up and say, ‘O people! The lies ascribed to me have become too much. Whoever intentionally ascribes lies to me will go to Hell.’ However, there were a lot more lies ascribed to him. Indeed the Prophet’s narrations only reach you from four persons. Firstly, narrations may reach you from a hypocrite who claims to believe in public, but has not hesitation whatsoever to ascribe lies to the Prophet (MGB). The people would not accept his lies, if they know that he is a hypocrite. However, the people believe what he says, because they think that he has seen the Prophet (MGB) and has heard what he says from the Prophet (MGB). They do not really know him. However, the Honorable the Exalted God has informed us about the hypocrites and their characteristics and said, ‘When thou lookest at them, their exteriors please thee; and when they speak, thou listenest to their words…’Such hypocrites existed even after the Prophet (MGB). They got close to the leaders who misled the people and invite to the fire, and spoke in favor of them so that they may be hired to fill major positions. The people usually follow their leaders, unless they are saved by God.Secondly, narrations may reach you through a man who has heard something from God’s Prophet (MGB), but has not memorized it. He has no intentions of lying but he has not understood it well. He possesses incorrect narrations. He instructs others to follow them and follows them himself. He narrates them for others and says that he has heard it from God’s Prophet. If the Muslims know that it is wrong, they would not accept it from him. It may even be the case that he might discard it, if he knew it was wrong.Thirdly, narrations may reach you from someone who has heard that God’s Prophet (MGB) has issued an order, but has not heard that God’s Prophet (MGB) himself has later issued an opposite order. Or he may have heard that God’s Prophet (MGB) has admonished against something, but has not heard that God’s Prophet (MGB) himself has later advised it. He remembers it one way but he has either not heard or doesn’t remember it the other way. If the Muslims knew that such and such an order has later been dismissed, they would abandon it.Fourthly, narrations may reach you from someone who has not ascribed lies to the Prophet of God (MGB). Rather he hates to lie since he fears the Honorable the Exalted God and honors God’s Prophet (MGB). Such a person may have memorized whatever he has heard from God’s Prophet (MGB) and may restate his words in exactly the same way that he has heard them. However, it may be the case that they use one decree and not use its opposite. The decrees of the Prophet (MGB) are similar to the verses of the Quran. There are ones that are opposite to the previous ones (to cancel or change them). The Prophet (MGB) had many such statements. We must accept what the Prophet (MGB) has said, and abandon what he has withheld as the Honorable the Exalted God said in His Book, ‘…So take what the Messenger assigns to you, and deny yourselves that which he withholds from you. And fear Allah for Allah is strict in Punishment.’Whoever doesn’t realize what God and the Prophet (MGB) meant would fall into error. It is not the case that all the companions of the Prophet (MGB) could give the proper answer to whatever they may be asked. Some of them asked some questions, but never tried to understand the answer. It seemed hard for them to understand things. They waited for a Bedouin to come and ask questions from the Prophet (MGB), so that they may hear theProphet’s response. I always had an especial time during the day and at night with the Prophet (MGB). He (MGB) let me be with him (MGB) during these times. All the companions of the Prophet (MGB) knew well that he (MGB) never treated anyone else this way. Sometimes the Prophet (MGB) came to see me in my house. Sometimes I went to see the Prophet (MGB) in his house. He (MGB) would then tell his wives to leave the room and had a private meeting with me. When the Prophet (MGB) came to see me in my house, he (MGB) would not tell Fatimah (MGB) or any of my children to leave. He (MGB) responded to whatever I asked. He (MGB) talked whenever I finished asking questions and remained silent. He (MGB) would clearly recite to me whatever Quranic verse which was revealed to him (MGB), so that I may write it in my own handwriting.

I have not forgotten any of the verses of the Holy Quran and any of the knowledge which he (MGB) stated to me and I wrote it down. The Prophet (MGB) did not withhold anything from me and taught me whatever God had taught him including issues such as the legitimate and the illegitimate; obligatory and forbidden deeds; books of the previous Prophets; their enjoining to do good deeds and admonishing against evil deeds. I memorized everything and did not forget anything. Then he put his hand on my chest and asked God to fill up my heart with knowledge, understanding, wisdom and light. I said, ‘O Prophet of God! May my parents be your ransom! I have forgotten nothing and have written all of that which you taught me since the time you prayed to God for me. Are you worried that I may forget them?’ The Prophet (MGB) replied, ‘No. I am not worried about that at all.’”"

If you do more than has been done to you, then you are being grateful. One who is grateful is also generous. One should recognizes that whatever good he does, he indeed dose it for himself. Thus, one will no longer expect anyone to return his favors, nor will he expect any friendship in return for his friendly deeds. Do not demand anything from others in return for what you do for yourself so as to guard your own honor. Anyone who asks you for something from you has indeed disregarded his own honor. So do not disregard your own reputation and fulfill his request.”"

If you perform any obligatory deeds in that month, your reward will be that of seventy similar cases in other months. It is the month of patience. The reward of patience is Paradise. Ramazan is the month of sympathy. It is the month in which God increases the share of a believer’s daily bread. Whoever feeds another believer (to break his fast) shall be given the rewardof freeing a slave. His past sins will also be forgiven.’ It was said to him (MGB), ‘O Prophet of God! Not all of us are able to feed another believer to break his fast!’ The Prophet (MGB) said, ‘Indeed the Honorable the Exalted God is generous. He would even give this reward to those of you who have nothing but a cup of milk, some juice, water or a date to feed another believer to break his fast. Whoever helps his slave with his duties during this month will be rewarded by God with an easier Reckoning. It is the month whose beginning is mercy, whose middle is forgiveness, and whose end is answering and releasing from the Fire. In it you are in need of four qualities: two qualities with which to please God, and two qualities with which you ask for the fulfillment of your own needs. The two qualities with which to please God are: testify that there is no god but God, and that I (Muhammad) am God’s Prophet. And the two qualities with which you may ask for the fulfillment of your needs are: Ask God for your needs and Paradise during that month. Also ask God to protect you from the Fire of Hell.’”"

Tame them to turn to thee. Put a portion of them on every hill and call out to them. They will come to thee (flying) with speed. Then know that God is Exalted in Power, Wise.’The Imam (MGB) said, “Abraham (MGB) took a hoopoe, a shrike, a peacock and a crow. He chopped them into pieces and mixed them up. Then he placed a part of their mixed flesh on top of (each of) the ten hillsaround there. He held each bird’s beak in his hand. He placed some seeds and water near himself and called out to them. The various parts of each bird started to fly towards each other and formed a perfect body. Each body went towards its own head and joined it to become a live bird. Then Abraham (MGB) let their beaks go. The birds flew and then landed. They drank the water and ate some seeds and said, ‘O Prophet of God! You have revived us. May God revive you.’ Abraham (MGB) said, ‘It is God who revives and takes away life. He has power over all things.’ This is the superficial interpretation.”The Imam (MGB) added, “However, the deep interpretation of this verse is as follows: Find four of the wise people. Teach them your knowledge. Send them around the world to invite the people to worship God.”The compiler of the book - may God be pleased with him - said, “I believe that Abraham (MGB) was ordered to do both things. The birds which he was ordered to catch were: a peacock, an eagle, a rooster and a duck. I heard Muhammad ibn Abdullah ibn Muhammad ibn Tayfur say the following regarding the following verse of the Holy Quran, ‘Behold! Abraham said, ""My Lord! Show me how Thou givest life to the dead."" He said, ""Dost thou not then believe?"" He said, ""Yea! but to satisfy My own undertaking."" He said, ""Take four birds; Tame them to turn to thee; put a portion of them on every hill and call to them: They will come to thee (Flying) with speed. Then know that Allah is Exalted in Power, Wise.”’“Indeed the Honorable the Exalted God ordered Abraham to visit one of His good servants. When Abraham saw him, the man told him, ‘Indeed the Blessed the Sublime God has a servant in this world called Abraham whom He has taken as His friend.’ Abraham asked him, ‘What are the signs of this servant?’ The man said, ‘God will bring back to life the dead for him.’ Then Abraham had doubts that he himself may not be that servant. That is why Abraham asked God to bring the dead back to life for him. ‘He said, ""Dost thou not then believe?"" He said, ""Yea! but to satisfy My own undertaking.""’That was when he was ordered to offer his son Ishmael. Indeed the Honorable the Exalted God ordered Abraham (MGB) to offer four birds - a peacock, an eagle, a duck and a rooster. The peacock referred to the adornments of this world. The eagle referred to great expectations. The duck referred to being needy, and the rooster referred to lustfulness. Indeed, in order to revive Abraham’s heart, the Honorable the Exalted God told him that he should abandon these four characteristics, since as long as he have them you cannot be with God.”The Imam (MGB) was asked, ‘Why did God ask Abraham whether or not he believed in God, although God is well-aware of his secrets and conditions?’ The Imam (MGB) replied, ‘When Abraham (MGB) said, ‘My Lord! Show me how Thou givest life to the dead?’ It seems that on the surface Abraham had doubts. However, this was asked so that he may be given a chance to answer and be acquitted of any such accusations.”"

When he first left the house in the morning, he encountered a big black mountain. He said to himself that God -may His Majesty be Exalted- had ordered him to eat it, and he wondered how to do it. Then he thought that God would not order him to do what was beyond his power. So he moved towards the mountain. The closer he got to the mountain, the smallerit became. When he finally reached it, it had turned into a small bite to eat. He ate it, and it was really delicious. He continued to go on until he reached a golden pan. He said to himself that the Honorable the Exalted God had ordered him to hide it. He dug a ditch, threw the golden pan in the ditch, covered it up with dirt, and started to go on his way again. However, then he noticed that the pan was visible out of the surface of the ground. He said to himself that he had done what the Honorable the Exalted God had ordered him to do and continued to go on. Then he suddenly saw a bird being pursued by a falcon trying to hunt it. The falcon was flying around the bird. The Prophet (MGB) remembered that God had ordered him to accept this one. He opened his sleeve, and the bird entered it. The falcon told the Prophet (MGB), ‘You have caught the prey that I was after for a few days.’ Then he remembered that the Honorable the Exalted God had ordered him not to disappoint this one. Then he cut a piece of the bird’s leg and threw it to the falcon. He continued to go on, and saw a piece of rotten meat. He remembered that the Honorable the Exalted God had ordered him to escape from this one, and he escaped from it. When he returned home and went to sleep, he had a dream. He was told, ‘You performed your mission, and did whatever you were instructed to do. Do you know what the philosophy behind all these issues is?’ He said, ‘No.’ He was told, ‘That mountain was anger. Whenever one gets angry, he doesn’t see himself and doesn’t realize his situation. If he restrains himself, recognizes his position and quenches his anger, the end is like a delicious bite which he eats. The golden pan is indeed man’s good deeds which are better to hide, but God will make them apparent so that he is adorned by them, and he receives the reward in the Hereafter. However, the bird is like a man who advises you, and you should accept his advice. The falcon is like a man who comes to you and asks you to fulfill his needs. You should not disappoint him. The rotten meat is like gossip which you should avoid.’”"

The man was one of those who love us. Aba Abdullah as-Sadiq (MGB) told him, ‘Indeed the Honorable the Exalted God appointed five swords to Muhammad (MGB). Three of them were never besheathed until the wars are over in the world. The wars in this world will not end until the sun rises from where it sets. On the day the sun rises from the west, everyone will be safe all over the world. On that day, the belief of those without a previous record of belief or have not done any good deeds, while they had belief would not do them any good. One of those swords is wrapped up and the other one is sheathed. It is meant to be drawn for others, but its control has been entrusted with us. And the other three swords are as follows. The first is the sword drawn upon the Arab unbelievers. The Blessed the Sublime God said, ‘But when the forbidden months are past, then fight and slay the Pagans wherever ye find them, an seize them, beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them in every stratagem (of war); but if they repent, and establish regular prayers and practise regular charity, then open the way for them: for Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.’ Nothing is accepted from these pagans unless they are killed by the sword, or accept Islam. Once they get killed, their wealth is seized and their children are captured. When the Prophet (MGB) captured any of them, he (MGB) forgave them and took some money for ransom and freed them. The second sword is that which is used for the people who are under the protection of Islam. The Honorable the Exalted God says, ‘… speak fair to the people…’ This was changed later and the following verse was revealed,‘Fight those who believe not in God nor the Last Day, nor hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by God and His Apostle, nor acknowledge the religion of Truth, (even if they are) of the People of the Book, until they pay the Jizya with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued.’ Those of them who live in a Muslim country should pay the Jizya (the poll-tax ) or be killed. If they agree to pay the poll-tax then they cannot be taken as captives; their property is to be safeguarded; and we can marry their women. We cannot accept any poll-tax from those of them who live in an enemy country that are at war with us. We can shed their blood and seize their property, but cannot marry their women. They should either be killed or accept Islam. And the third sword was drawn upon the non-Arab atheists - that is the Turks, the Deilams and the Khazars. The Honorable the Exalted God says, ‘Therefore, when ye meet the Unbelievers (in fight), smite at their necks; At length, when ye have thoroughly subdued them, bind a bond firmly (on them): thereafter (is the time for) either generosity or ransom: Until the war lays down its burdens. Thus (are ye commanded): but if it had been Allah’s Will, He could certainly have exacted retribution from them (Himself)…’ This implies that they should be killed unless they sign a treaty with you and pay ransom. As long as they are at war with the Muslims, no one can marry their women. And the sword that is wrapped up is the sword of the rebellious ones whose deeds would end up in war as the Blessed the Sublime God says, ‘If two parties among the Believers fall into a quarrel, make ye peace between them: but if one of them transgresses beyond bounds against the other, then fight ye (all) against the one that transgresses until it complies with the Command of God...’ the Honorable the Exalted. Once this verse was revealed, the Prophet of God (MGB) said, ‘There is someone who is going to fight against those who transgress after me amongst you.’ He was asked, ‘Who is that?’ The Prophet (MGB) said, ‘The one who mends his shoes’ while he (MGB) was referring to the Commander of the Faithful Ali (MGB). Am’mar ibn Yasir said, “I have fought along with the Prophet (MGB) and his household with three groups of unbelievers under this flag and this is the fourth group with whom I fight. I swear by God that even if they drive us back as far away as the date plantations of Hajar, we are sure that we are rightful and they are deviated. The way the Commander of the Faithful (MGB) treated the rebellious ones was the same as that of God’s Prophet (MGB) with the people of Mecca at the time he (MGB) conquered Mecca. The Prophet (MGB) did not capture their offspring and ordered that anyone who sits in his home and puts his armaments aside is safe; anyone who had entered the house of Abu Sufyan is safe. This was the same way that the Commander of the FaithfulAli (MGB) ordered in Basra during the Battle of Jamal: do not capture the rebellions’ offspring; do not kill their injured ones and do not pursue those who escape. Whoever closes the door of his house and puts his armaments aside is a safe. And the sword which is left in its sheath is the sword with which punishment by the law of retaliation is to be performed as the Honorable the Exalted God says, ‘…Life for life…’. This sword is meant to be for the relatives of the person who has been killed, but the ruling over it has been entrusted with us. These were the swords which the Honorable the Exalted God appointed to His Prophet. Whoever denies them or denies any of the decrees regarding them has indeed rejected whatever God has revealed to Muhammad (MGB).”"

Do not consider one who doesn’t have these conditions to be your perfect friend. Whoever doesn’t have any of these conditions has no basis for being your friend. The first condition is that he should be so honest with you that his hidden personality and his evident personality are the same for you.

The third condition is that he should not change when he gets some wealth or a position. The fourth condition is that he should not withhold from you what he can. And the fifth condition is that he should not leave you alone at times of hardship.”"

One day Al-Walid ibn Muqayrih passed a man from the Khaza’eh clan who had spread his arrows on the ground and was sharpening them. One of the arrows flew up, hit him, cut his jugular vein and blood ran down his neck until he died, while he was yelling ‘Muhammad’s God killed me!’ Al-As ibn Va’el al-Sahmi went out of his house to Arafat in order to fulfill his needs. A pebble rolled under his foot and he fell down. He died while he was yelling ‘Muhammad’s God killed me!’ Al-Aswad ibn Abdeh Yaqouth went out with his servant to meet his son Zameh. He rested under the shadow of a tree which was on the slope of a hill. Gabriel (MGB) came down, grabbed his head and beat it against the tree. Then he told his servant, ‘Save me from this man!’ His servant replied, ‘I do not see anyone there. You are beating your head on the tree yourself.’ He died while he was yelling ‘Muhammad’s God killed me!’The compiler of the book - may God be pleased with him - said, ‘In another tradition it has been narrated that the Prophet (MGB) had cursed Al-Aswad (ibn Abdeh Yaqouth) and had wished that God make him blind and kill his child. On the day when he reached that place, Gabriel (MGB) touched him with a green leaf which made him blind. He survived until the Honorable the Exalted God took away the life of his son in the Battle of Badr and then he himself died.’And Al-Harith ibn al-Tala’talat left his house when a hot wind was blowing. The wind blew upon him until he became like an Ethiopian man since he had become very black-faced. When he returned home, he was asked, ‘Who are you?’ He said, ‘I am Al-Harith.’ However, they did not believe him. They became so angry with him that they killed him. He died while he was yelling ‘Muhammad’s God killed me!’Al-Aswad ibn Abdul Mutalib ate a salty fish. He became very thirsty. He drank a lot of water and his stomach swelled up. He died while he was yelling ‘Muhammad’s God killed me!’ All this happened at the same time. That was because they had gone to God’s Prophet (MGB) and said, ‘If youput aside what you claim until noon, it is fine. If not we will kill you.’ The Prophet (MGB) returned home while he was sad and had locked himself up. At that time, Gabriel (MGB) descended to him and said, ‘O Muhammad! God greets you and says ‘Openly attend to what you have been ordered to do.’ This means that he (MGB) should publicly announce his call to the people of Mecca and ‘turn away from the atheists.’ The Prophet (MGB) had said, ‘O Gabriel!

A goldsmith would plan to have the people lose their money. When a slaughterer of quadrupeds kills the quadrupeds, he will not forgive others wholeheartedly.

Those who forced the people of Moses to worship the calf were five who were from the same family and ate at the same table. Their names were Azinooh, his brother Mizooyeh, his cousin, his daughter and his wife. These people were the same ones whom the Honorable the Exalted God ordered to offer a cow which they did.’”The compiler of the book - may God be pleased with him - said, “I included this narration here since there was a mention of five in it. However, my own decree on the issue of offering is that one camel or one cow suffices for seven persons, even if they are not the members of one family. This decree is the subject of another narration and it is not contradictory with this narration. In this narration it is stated that the offering of a camel is sufficient for one person, while it is stated in another narration that it is sufficient for seven persons.

الكوفي الفزاري قال: حدثنا محمد بن الحسين بن زيد الزيات قال: حدثنا محمد بن زياد الازدي، عن المفضل ابن عمر، عن الصادق جعفر بن محمد عليهما السلام قال: سألته عن قول الله عز وجل: ""وَإِذْ ابْتَلَى إِبْرَاهِيمَ رَبُّهُ بِكَلِمَاتٍ"" ما هذه الكلمات؟قال: هي الكلمات التي تلقاها آدم من ربه فتاب عليه وهو أنه قال: يارب أسألك بحق محمد وعلي وفاطمة والحسن والحسين الا تبت علي، فتاب الله عليه إنه هو التواب الرحيمفقلت له: يا ابن رسول الله فما يعني عز وجل بقوله ""فَأَتَمَّهُنَّ""؟قال: يعني فأتمهن إلى القائم عليه السلام اثني عشر إماما تسعة من ولد الحسينقال المفضل: فقلت له: يا ابن رسول الله فأخبرني عن قول الله عز وجل: ""وَجَعَلَهَا كَلِمَةً بَاقِيَةً فِي عَقِبِهِ .""قال: يعني بذلك الامامة جعلها الله في عقب الحسين إلى يوم القيامةقال: فقلت له: يا ابن رسول الله فكيف صارت الامامة في ولد الحسين دون ولد الحسن عليهما السلام، وهما جميعا ولدا رسول صلى الله عليه وآله وسبطاه وسيدا شباب أهل الجنة؟فقال عليه السلام: إن موسى وهارون كانا نبيين مرسلين أخوين فجعل الله النبوة في صلب هارون دون صلب موسى، ولم يكن لاحد أن يقول: لم فعل الله ذلك، وإن الامامة خلافة [من] الله عز وجل ليس لاحد أن يقول: لم جعلها الله في صلب الحسين دون صلب الحسن، لان الله هو الحكيم في أفعاله، لا يسئل عما يفعل وهم يسألونولقول الله تبارك وتعالى ""وَإِذِ ابْتَلَى إِبْرَاهِيمَ رَبُّهُ بِكَلِمَاتٍ فَأَتَمَّهُنَّ"" وجه آخر وما ذكرناه أصله والابتلاء على ضربين أحدهما يستحيل على الله تعالى ذكره، والآخر جائز، فاما ما يستحيل فهو أن يختبره ليعلم ما تكشف الايام عنه، وهذا ما لا يصح له لانه عز وجل علام الغيوب، والضرب الآخر من الابتلاء أن يبتليه حتى يصبر فيما يبتليه به فيكون ما يعطيه من العطاء على سبيل الاستحقاق، ولينظر إليه الناظر فيقتدي به، فيعلم من حكمة الله عز وجل أنه لم يكل أسباب الامامة إلا إلى الكافي المستقل، الذي كشفت الايام عنه بخبره، فاما الكلمات فمنها ما ذكرناه، ومنها اليقين وذلك قول الله عز وجل: ""وَكَذَلِكَ نُرِي إِبْرَاهِيمَ مَلَكُوتَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالأَرْضِ وَلِيَكُونَ مِنْ الْمُوقِنِينَ"" ومنها المعرفة بقدم باريه وتوحيده وتنزيهه عن التشبيه حين نظر إلى الكوكب، والقمر والشمس فاستدل بأفول كل واحد منها على حدثه وبحدثه على محدثه، ثم علمه عليه السلام بأن الحكم بالنجوم خطأ في قوله عز وجل: ""فَنَظَرَ نَظْرَةً فِي النُّجُومِ فَقَالَ إِنِّي سَقِيمٌ"" وإنما قيده الله سبحانه بالنظرة الواحدة لان النظرة الواحدة لا توجب الخطأ إلا بعد النظرة الثانية بدلالة قول النبي صلى الله عليه وآله لما قال لامير المؤمنين عليه السلام: ""يا علي أول النظرة لك، والثانية عليك لا لك""، ومنها الشجاعة وقد كشفت الايام والاصنام عنه بدلالة قوله عز وجل: ""إِذْ قَالَ ِلأَبِيهِ وَقَوْمِهِ مَا هَذِهِ التَّمَاثِيلُ الَّتِي أَنْتُمْ لَهَا عَاكِفُونَ, قَالُوا وَجَدْنَا آبَاءَنَا لَهَا عَابِدِينَ, قَالَ لَقَدْ كُنتُمْ أَنْتُمْ

أعداء الله عز وجل تمام الشجاعة، ثم الحلم مضمن معناه في قوله عز وجل: ""إِنَّ إِبْرَاهِيمَ لَحَلِيمٌ أَوَّاهٌ مُنِيبٌ"" ثم السخاء وبيانه في حديث ضيف إبراهيم المكرمين، ثم العزلة عن أهل البيت والعشيرة مضمن معناه في قوله: ""وَأَعْتَزِلُكُمْ وَمَا تَدْعُونَ مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ وَأَدْعُو رَبِّي عَسَى أَلاَّ أَكُونَ بِدُعَاءِ رَبِّي شَقِيًّا"" والامر بالمعروف والنهي عن المنكر بيان ذلك في قوله عز وجل:

بالحسنة، وذلك لما قال له أبوه: ""اراغب أنت عن آلهتي ياإبراهيم لئن لم تنته لارجمنك واهجرني مليا"" فقال في جواب أبيه ""سَأَسْتَغْفِرُ لَكَ رَبِّي إِنَّهُ كَانَ بِي حَفِيًّا"" والتوكل بيان ذلك في قوله: ""الَّذِي خَلَقَنِي فَهُوَ يَهْدِينِ, وَالَّذِي هُوَ يُطْعِمُنِي وَيَسْقِينِ, وَإِذَا مَرِضْتُ فَهُوَ يَشْفِينِ, وَالَّذِي يُمِيتُنِي ثُمَّ يُحْيِينِ, وَالَّذِي أَطْمَعُ أَنْ يَغْفِرَ لِي خَطِيئَتِي يَوْمَ الدِّينِ ""ثم الحكم والانتماء إلى الصالحين في قوله: ""رب هب لي حكما وألحقني بالصالحين"" يعني بالصالحين الذين لا يحكمون إلا بحكم الله عز وجل، ولا يحكمون بالآراء والمقائيس حتى يشهد له من يكون بعده من الحجج بالصدق بيان ذلك في قوله:""وَاجْعَلْ لِي لِسَانَ صِدْقٍ فِي الآخِرِينَ"" أراد به هذه الامة الفاضلة فأجابه الله وجعل له ولغيره من أنبيائه لسان صدق في الآخرين، وهو علي بن أبي طالب عليه السلام وذلك قوله عز وجل:""وَجَعَلْنَا لَهُمْ لِسَانَ صِدْقٍ عَلِيًّا .""والمحنة في النفس حين جعل في المنجنيق وقذف به في النار، ثم المحنة في الولد حين امر بذبح ابنه إسماعيل، ثم المحنة بالاهل حين خلص الله عز وجل حرمته من عزازة القبطي المذكور في هذه القصة، ثم الصبر على سوء خلق سارة، ثم استقصار النفس في الطاعة في قوله:""ولا تخزني يوم يبعثون"" ثم النزاهة في قوله عز وجل: ""مَا كَانَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ يَهُودِيًّا وَلاَ نَصْرَانِيًّا وَلَكِنْ كَانَ حَنِيفًا مُسْلِمًا وَمَا كَانَ مِنْ الْمُشْرِكِينَ"" ثم الجمع لاشراط الكلمات في قوله: قُلْ ""إِنَّ صَلاَتِي وَنُسُكِي وَمَحْيَايَ وَمَمَاتِي للهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ لاَ شَرِيكَ لَهُ وَبِذَلِكَ أُمِرْتُ وَأَنَا أَوَّلُ الْمُسْلِمِينَ."" فقد جمع في قوله ""مَحْيَايَ وَمَمَاتِي للهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ"" جميع أشراط الطاعات كلها حتى لا تعزب عنه عازبة ولا تغيب عن معانيها غائبة. ثم استجابة الله دعوته حين قال: ""رَبِّ أَرِنِي كَيْفَ تُحْيِ الْمَوْتَى"" وهذه آية متشابهة معناها أنه سأل عن الكيفية والكيفية من فعل الله عز وجل متى لم يعلمها العالم لم يلحقه عيب، ولا عرض في توحيده نقص، فقال الله عز وجل: ""أَوَلَمْ تُؤْمِنْ؟ قَالَ بَلَى"" هذا شرط عامة من آمن به متى سئل واحد منهم ""أَوَلَمْ تُؤْمِنْ"" وجب أن يقول: بلى، كما قال إبراهيم، ولما قال الله عز وجل لجميع أرواح بني آدم: ""أَلَسْتُ بِرَبِّكُمْ قَالُوا بَلَى"" قال: أول من قال بلى محمد صلى الله عليه وآله فصار بسبقه إلى ""بلى"" سيد الاولين والآخرين، وأفضل النبيين والمرسلين.فمن لم يجب عن هذه المسألة بجواب إبراهيم فقد رغب عن ملته، قال الله عز وجل: ""وَمَنْ يَرْغَبُ عَنْ مِلَّةِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ إِلاَّ مَنْ سَفِهَ نَفْسَهُ"" ثم اصطفاء الله عزوجل إياه في الدنيا ثم شهادته له في العاقبة أنه من الصالحين في قوله عز وجـل :"" وَلَقَدِ اصْطَفَيْنَاهُ فِي الدُّنْيَا وَإِنَّهُ فِي الآخِرَةِ لَمِنَ الصَّالِحِينَ."" والصالحون هم النبي والائمة صلوات الله عليهم أجمعين الاخذون عن اله عز وجل أمره ونهية والملتمسون للصلاح من عنده والمجتنبون للرأي والقياس في دينه في قوله: ""إِذْ قَالَ لَهُ رَبُّهُ أَسْلِمْ قَالَ أَسْلَمْتُ لِرَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ"" ثم اقتداء من بعده من الانبياء عليهم السلام به في قوله عز وجل: ""وَوَصَّى بِهَا إِبْرَاهِيمُ بَنِيهِ وَيَعْقُوبُ يَا بَنِيَّ إِنَّ اللَّهَ اصْطَفَى لَكُمْ الدِّينَ فَلاَ تَمُوتُنَّ إِلاَّ وَأَنْتُمْ مُسْلِمُونَ"" وفي قوله عز وجل لنبيه صلى الله عليه وآله، ""ثُمَّ أَوْحَيْنَا إِلَيْكَ أَنِ اتَّبِعْ مِلَّةَ إِبْرَاهِيمَ حَنِيفًا وَمَا كَانَ مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ"" وفي قوله عز وجل: ""مِلَّةَ أَبِيكُمْ إِبْرَاهِيمَ هُوَ سَمَّاكُمْ الْمُسْلِمينَ مِنْ قَبْلُ"" وأشراط كلمات الامام مأخوذة مما تحتاج إليه الامة من جهته من مصالح الدنيا والآخرةوقول إبراهيم عليه السلام: ""وَمِنْ ذُرِّيَّتِي"" ""من"" حرف تبعيض ليعلم أن من الذرية من يستحق الامامة، ومنهم من لا يستحق الامامة، هذا من جملة المسلمين، وذلك أنه يستحيل أن يدعو إبراهيم بالامامة للكافر أو للمسلم الذي ليس بمعصوم، فصح أن باب التبعيض وقع على خواص المؤمنين والخواص إنما صاروا خواصا بالبعد عن الكفر، ثم من اجتنب الكبائر صار من جملة الخواص أخص، ثم المعصوم هو الخاص الاخص ولو كان للتخصيص صورة أربى عليه لجعل ذلك من أوصاف الامامقد سمى الله عز وجل عيسى من ذرية إبراهيم وكان ابن ابنته من بعده، ولما صح أن ابن البنت ذرية ودعا إبراهيم لذريته بالامامة وجب على محمد صلى الله عليه وآله الاقتداء به في وضع الامامة في المعصومين من ذريته حذو النعل بالنعل بعد ما أوحى الله عز وجل إليه وحكم عليه بقوله ""ثُمَّ أَوْحَيْنَا إِلَيْكَ أَنِ اتَّبِعْ مِلَّةَ إِبْرَاهِيمَ حَنِيفًا وَمَا كَانَ مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ"" ولو خالف ذلك لكان داخـلا في قـولـه عـزوجل: ""وَمَنْ يَرْغَبُ عَنْ مِلَّةِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ إِلاَّ مَنْ سَفِهَ نَفْسَهُ"" جل نبي الله عن ذلكوقال الله عز وجل: ""إِنَّ أَوْلَى النَّاسِ بِإِبْرَاهِيمَ لَلَّذِينَ اتَّبَعُوهُ وَهَذَا النَّبِيُّ وَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا"" وأمير المؤمنين عليه السلام أبوذرية النبي صلى الله عليه وآله ووضع لامامية فيه وضعها في ذريته المعصومينوقوله عز وجل: ""لاَ يَنَالُ عَهْدِي الظَّالِمِينَ"" عني به أن الامامة لا تصلح لمن قد عبد صنما أو وثنا أو أشرك بالله طرفة عين وإن أسلم بعد ذلك والظلم وضع الشئ في غير موضعهوأعظم الظلم الشرك قال الله عز وجل: ""إِنَّ الشِّرْكَ لَظُلْمٌ عَظِيمٌ"" وكذلك لا تصلح الامامة لمن قد ارتكب من المحارم شيئا صغيرا كان أو كبيرا وإن تاب منه بعد ذلك، وكذلك لا يقم الحد من في جنبه حد فاذا لا يكون الامام إلا معصوما ولا تعلم عصمته إلا بنص الله عز وجل عليه على لسان نبيه صلى الله عليه وآله لان العصمة ليست في ظاهر الخلقة فترى كالسواد والبياض وما أشبه ذلك وهي مغيبة لا تعرف إلا بتعريف علام الغيوب عز وجل","5-85 Ali ibn Ahmad ibn Musa - may God be pleased with him - narrated that Hamzih ibn al-Qasim al-Alavi al-Ab’basi quoted Ja’far ibn Malik al-Kufy al-Fazari, on the authority of Muhammad ibn al-Hussein ibn Zyad al-Zyat, on the authority of Muhammad ibn Zyad al-Azodi, on the authority of Al-Mufaz’zal ibn Umar, “I asked Ja’far ibn Muhammad as-Sadiq (MGB), ‘What is meant by Abraham was tried by God in the following words of the Honorable the Exalted God, And remember that Abraham was tried by his Lord with certain commands,… ’”The Imam (MGB) replied, ‘This refers to the sayings which God heard from Adam and accepted Adam’s (MGB) repentance. Adam beseeched to God by Muhammad (MGB), Ali (MGB), Fatimah (MGB), Hassan (MGB) and Hussein (MGB) to accept his (MGB) repentance and God accepted it as He is the One who accepts repentance and is the Merciful.’I asked the Imam (MGB), ‘O (grand)son of the Prophet of God! What is God’s intention in saying, ‘…He fulfilled…’ The Imam (MGB) replied, ‘This implies that God completed the names of the Imams up until the twelfth Imam nine of whom are from the progeny of Al-Hussein (MGB).’I asked the Imam (MGB), ‘O (grand)son of the Prophet of God! Please inform me about the meaning of the following words of the Honorable the Exalted God, ‘And he left it as a Word to endure among those who came after him,…’The Imam (MGB) said, ‘This implies that God established Divine Leadership in the progeny of Al-Hussein (MGB) up until the Resurrection Day.’I asked the Imam (MGB), ‘O (grand)son of the Prophet of God! Please tell me why was the Divine Leadership established in the progeny of Al-Hussein (MGB), but not in the progeny of Al-Hassan (MGB) who was the older son even though both of them were the grandsons of God’s Prophet (MGB) and were both considered to be the Masters of the Youth in Paradise?’The Imam (MGB) said, ‘Moses (MGB) and Aaron (MGB) were both appointed Prophets and were also brothers. God established the Prophethood in the progeny of Aaron (MGB), but not the progeny of Moses (MGB). No one can question why God did that. Divine Leadership is also a form of Caliphate from the Honorable the Exalted God. No one can say why God placed it in the progeny of Al-Hussein (MGB), but not in the progeny of Al-Hassan (MGB). Indeed God is Wise in what He does. He cannot be questioned regarding what He does, while the people will be questioned regarding what they do.’There is another interpretation of the following sayings of the Blessed the Sublime God, ‘And remember that Abraham was tried by his Lord with certain commands, which he fulfilled…’ What was said above is the main interpretation. There are two forms of trials. One is befitting for the Sublime God, but the other one is not. What is not befitting for God is to say that God tries something to find out the results which He knows not. That is to discover through practical experimentation. This is inapplicable to God since He is the All-Knower of everything that is hidden. What can be said about God is for Him to try a servant, so that he may persevere at times of hardship and become worthy of a rank. It also serves as a means of teaching for others, so that they may look at him and follow him. And they may know that the Honorable the Exalted God would not grant the position of Divine Leadership unless out of His Wisdom and would only bestow it upon one who deserves that rank. His worthiness of that rank shall be discovered later. This was one interpretation of God’s words. Another interpretation of these words could be in reference to certitude as the Honorable the Exalted God says, ‘So also did We show Abraham the power and the laws of the heavens and the Earth, that he might (with understanding) have certitude.’And another interpretation of these words could be in reference to God’s recognition - to know that God is Pure, One, and without any similitude as Abraham looked at the stars and the sun and discovered that they are all created since they set. Then God taught him that the decrees of the astrologers is wrong as the Honorable the Exalted God says, “Then did he cast a glance at the Stars. And he said, ""I am indeed sick (at heart)!” God expressed his one glance since the first glance is not considered wrong. Rather, it is the second glance that would constitute an error as the Prophet (MGB) told Ali (MGB), ‘O Ali (MGB)! The first glance is yours, but the second glance opposes you.’And another interpretation could be bravery that is clear by what happened to the idols as the Honorable the Exalted God says, “Behold! he said to his father and his people, ‘What are these images, to which ye are (so assiduously) devoted?’ They said, ‘We found our fathers worshipping them.’ He said, ‘Indeed ye have been in manifest error ye and your fathers.’ They said, ‘Have you brought us the Truth, or are you one of those who jest?’ He said, ‘Nay, your Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the Earth, He Who created them (from nothing): and I am a witness to this (Truth). And by God, I have a plan for your idols after ye go away and turn your backs’...So he broke them into pieces, (all) but the biggest of them, that they might turn (and address themselves) to it.”Standing single-handed against a lot of the enemies of the Honorable the Exalted God by Abraham is a sign of his utmost bravery.Then it refers to his forbearance which is implied in what the Honorable the Exalted God says, ‘For Abraham was, without doubt, forbearing (of faults), compassionate, and given to look to God.’Then it refers to his generosity which can be seen from the stories regarding the noble guests of Abraham (as we can see from the following, ‘Has the story reached thee, of the honored guests of Abraham?)’Then it refers to his isolation from the members of his family and clan as we can conclude from the following, ‘And I will turn away from you (all) and from those whom ye invoke besides God: I will call on my Lord: perhaps, by my prayer to my Lord, I shall be not unblest.’ And enjoining to do good and admonishing against evil as we understand from the following words of the Honorable the Exalted God, “…‘O my father! why worship that which heareth not and seeth not, and can profit thee nothing? O my father! to me hath come knowledge which hath not reached thee: so follow me: I will guide thee to a way that is even and straight. O my father! serve not Satan: for Satan is a rebel against (God) Most Gracious. O my father! I fear lest a Penalty afflict thee from (God) Most Gracious, so that thou become to Satan a friend.”And responding to wickedness with goodness as we read in his response to his father after the father said, “(The father) replied, ‘Art thou shrinking from my gods, O Abraham? If thou forbear not, I will indeed stone thee. Now get away from me for a good long while!’"" Abraham (MGB) replied, ‘…I will pray to my Lord for thy forgiveness: for He is to me Most Gracious….’And it also refers to his reliance as we read, ‘Who created me, and it is He Who guides me; Who gives me food and drink; And when I am ill, it is He Who cures me; Who will cause me to die, and then to life (again); And who, I hope, will forgive me my faults on the Day of Judgment.’Then it also refers to wisdom and requesting to be of the righteous ones as we read, ‘O my Lord! Bestow wisdom on me, and join me with the righteous;’ This refers to the righteous ones who only judge based on the Honorable the Exalted God’s decrees and not their own personal opinion or innovations. This was so that the Proofs of God that will come later on testify to his sincerity as we understand from his words, ‘Grant me honorable mention on the tongue of truth among the latest (generations);’Here he was referring to this noble nation. God accepted his prayer and established a representative for him and the rest of the Prophets and granted him an ‘honorable mention on the tongue of truth among the latest (generations);’ which refers to Ali ibn Abi Talib (MGB) as the Honorable the Exalted God says, ‘And We granted them lofty honor on the tongue of truth.’Then it refers to a trial in his life when he was put in a catapult and thrown into the fire. Then it refers to a trial in his son when he was ordered to offer his son Ishmael. Then it refers to his trial through his family when the Honorable the Exalted God freed his wife from the hands of Azarat al-Qabti mentioned in history. Then it refers to his patience with the bad-temperedness of (his wife) Sarah. Then it refers to him underestimating his own degree of obedience as we read, ‘And let me not be in disgrace on the Day when (men) will be raised up;’Then it refers to his true faith as the Honorable the Exalted God says, ‘Abraham was not a Jew nor yet a Christian; but he was true in Faith, and bowed his will to God’s (Which is Islam), and he joined not gods with God.’Then it refers to the complete obedience in his words as we read, ""Truly, my prayer and my service of sacrifice, my life and my death, are (all) for God - the Cherisher of the Worlds: No partner hath He: this am I commanded, and I am the first of those who bow to His will.” All the conditions of obedience are integrated into his words, ‘my life and my death, are (all) for God - the Cherisher of the Worlds.’ He has not missed the least bit and has not covered up any minute points.Then it refers to the fact that God fulfilled his supplications when he said, ‘My Lord! Show me how Thou givest life to the dead…’ This could have two different meanings. One could think that he was asking God to show him how the Honorable the Exalted God gives life to the dead. It is not wrong for one who doesn’t know something to ask about it. It would not imply that his belief in monotheism is questionable. Then the Honorable the Exalted God asked him, ‘Dost thou not then believe? He said, ’Yea!...’ This is required of anyone to answer if asked ‘Dost thou not then believe?’ as Abraham (MGB) did. This is as the Honorable the Exalted God asked all the spirits from the progeny of Adam (MGB) ‘Am I not your Lord (who cherishes and sustains you)?’ They said, ‘Yea!…’ The first one to answer in the positive was Muhammad (MGB) being a pioneer in that. He (MGB) became the Master of those of the earlier times and those of the later times. He (MGB) became the noblest of the Prophets and the Messengers. Whoever doesn’t mention this response of Abraham (MGB) has indeed turned away from the religion of Abraham as the Honorable the Exalted God says, ‘And who turns away from the religion of Abraham but such as debase their souls with folly? …’Then the Honorable the Exalted God appointed Abraham (MGB) in this world and he (MGB) shall be from the good ones in the Hereafter as the Honorable the Exalted God says in the rest of that same verse, ‘…Him Wechose and rendered pure in this world: And he will be in the Hereafter in the ranks of the Righteous.’ The Righteous ones are the Prophets and the Imams - may God bless them all - who received orders from the Honorable the Exalted God as to what is good and what is evil. They all asked God for improvements. They all avoided personal opinions and innovations in His Religion as God says, “Behold! his Lord said to him: ‘Bow (thy will to Me):’ He said, ‘I bow (my will) to the Lord and Cherisher of the Universe.’” Then all the other Prophets followed him as the Honorable the Exalted God says, “And this was the legacy that Abraham left to his sons, and so did Jacob; ""Oh my sons! God hath chosen the Faith for you; then die not except in the Faith of Islam.” Also the Honorable the Exalted God tells His Prophet, “So We have taught thee the inspired (Message), ""Follow the ways of Abraham the True in Faith, and he joined not gods with God."" And as the Honorable the Exalted God says, “…it is the cult of your father Abraham. It is He Who has named you Muslims, both before”The conditions for Divine Leadership have been obtained from the necessities of this world and the Hereafter.And in what Abraham (MGB) said, “…from my offspring!” ‘from’ implies a form of distinction, since some of his progeny did not deserve to be a Divine Leader, and some did. They were Muslims and unbelievers. It was impossible for Abraham (MGB) to pray for those who were either Muslims or unbelievers to be Divine Leaders. Therefore, it must be concluded that Abraham (MGB) took into consideration the Muslims and even the especial Muslims who were sincere believers which had abandoned unbelief. Then he (MGB) took into consideration a smaller group of them who were just ones who had abandoned major sins. Then he (MGB) took into consideration a smaller group of them who were Immaculate and never even thought of committing any sins. If there were any more conditions they would also be included in the conditions for Divine Leadership.The Honorable the Exalted God has mentioned Jesus (MGB) to be of the progeny of Abraham (MGB) even though Jesus (MGB) was in the line of Abraham (MGB) through Abraham’s great grand-daughter (i.e. Mary (MGB)). As God has considered those born in the line of a great grand-daughter to be of Abraham’s progeny, and Abraham (MGB) had prayed for Divine Leadership to continue through his progeny, it is incumbent upon Muhammad (MGB) to follow Abraham (MGB). Muhammad established the line of Immaculate Divine Leadership in his progeny through his daughter, since the Honorable the Exalted God had ordered him to follow Abraham (MGB) as we read, “So We have taught thee the inspired (Message), Follow the ways of Abraham the True in Faith, and he joined not gods with God.”Had Muhammad (MGB) not followed this order, he would have been considered to be amongst those who had turned away from the religion of Abraham as we read, “And who turns away from the religion of Abraham but such as debase their souls with folly?”The Prophet Muhammad (MGB) was more majestic than that. Therefore, we read as the Honorable the Exalted God says, “Without doubt, among men, the nearest of kin to Abraham, are those who follow him, as are also this Apostle and those who believe: …”And the Commander of the Faithful Imam Ali (MGB) is the father of the progeny of God’s Prophet (MGB) who were entrusted with Divine Leadership and were Immaculate as the Honorable the Exalted God says, “But My Promise is not within the reach of evildoers.” That refers to those who worshipped an idol or associated partners with God even for a twinkling of an eye, and even if they submitted to Islam afterwards. It is not right to place something in the improper place and the worst form of unbelief is associating partners with God as the Honorable the Exalted God says, “… for false worship is indeed the highest wrongdoing.” That is why one who commits a sin - be it minor or major - doesn’t deserve to be a Divine Leader even though he may repent afterwards. One who is to be punished by a religious decree cannot be the one to issue the rule for others to be punished by the same decree. Ordering to punish those who have violated religious rules is one of the duties of a Divine Leader. Therefore, a Divine Leader must be Immaculate. That would not be known except through what the Honorable the Exalted God reveals to us by the tongue of the Prophet (MGB). Being Immaculate is not like being black or white which could be seen from one’s outward appearance. Rather, it is a hidden characteristic which can only be recognized through what is expressed by the All-Knowing the Honorable the Exalted God.”"

Sorry. I have seen five nobilities. Even if I had just one of them, I would have loved it more than red-haired camels.The first nobility is that once when God’s Prophet (MGB) had dispatched Abu Bakr with the Bara’at Chapter (Declaration of Immunity) of the Quran to declare and Abu Bakr had left, the Prophet (MGB) sent Ali (MGB) to take that Chapter from Abu Bakr. Then Abu Bakr returned and said, ‘O Prophet of God! Was anything revealed about me?’ The Prophet (MGB) replied, ‘No. The only thing that was revealed was that only someone who is from my own household should propagate this Chapter.’The second nobility is that God’s Prophet (MGB) ordered all his uncles and companions to shut all the doors from the mosque to their homes, except for the one to Ali’s house. They asked, ‘You shut all the doors but left his open?’ The Prophet (MGB) replied, ‘I did not shut those doors, and I did not leave that one open on my own. All that was ordered by the Honorable the Exalted God.The third nobility is that when God’s Prophet (MGB) dispatched Umar ibn al-Khat’tab and another man to fight at Khaybar, they both returned after having been defeated. Then the Prophet (MGB) said, ‘Tomorrow I shall hand over the flag to the one who loves God and the Prophet of God, and the one who is loved by God and the Prophet of God and recites a lot of glorifications of God.’ Many people showed themselves to the Prophet (MGB) to attain this nobility, but he (MGB) called in Ali (MGB) and handed him the flag. Ali (MGB) did not return until God granted him (MGB) victory.The fourth nobility is that on the day of Qadir Khum, God’s Prophet grabbed Ali’s hand and raised him up while asking, ‘Am I not more of a Master over you than you yourselves are?’ The people replied, ‘Yes. O Prophet of God.’ The Prophet (MGB) said, ‘Ali is the Master of whomever I am the Master of.’The fifth nobility is that God’s Prophet (MGB) established Ali (MGB) as his Trustee in his household. Ali (MGB) went to the Prophet (MGB) and the Prophet (MGB) told him, ‘Your position relative to me is the same as Aaron’s position relative to Moses (MGB) - with the only exception that there shall be no Prophets after me.’”"

Should we be friends with them?’ Imam as-Sadiq (MGB) replied, ‘Yes, absolutely. Is it not true that God has things that the Prophet of God doesn’t have? Is it not true that the Prophet of God has things that we do not have? Is it not true thatwe have things that you do not have? Is it not true that you have things that others do not have? God the Blessed the Sublime has partitioned Islam into seven parts, and has distributed them amongst the people. These are perseverance, honesty, certitude, contentment, loyalty, knowledge, and patience. Whoever possesses all seven has perfect faith and is strong. He gave some people just one, some just two, some just three, some just four, some just five, some just six, and some all seven of these. Therefore, you should not expect one who has only been given one part of the faith to be responsible for two parts. You cannot burden one who has been granted only two parts of the faith with what you would ask from those who have three parts of faith. And so on. If you expect too much of them, they will be over-burdened and might turn away from the religion. Instead you should be patient and treat them with kindness, and make things easy for them. Now I will cite an example for you. There was a Muslim man with an infidel neighbor who was his friend. The man wished to help his friend become a Muslim. He kept trying to show him how nice Islam was, and insisted on his becoming a Muslim. Finally, he managed, and the man accepted Islam. The next morning the man went to his neighbor’s house, and asked him to accompany him to the morning congregation prayer. They went there and when the prayer ended he told the new Muslim man to sit down and recite the Quran until sunrise. They stayed there, and continued reciting until sunrise. Then he told him it was nice to fast that day and study the Quran until noon. The new Muslim agreed. After the noon and afternoon prayers, he suggested to the new Muslim man to stay there until dawn, to say their prayers in the mosque and then go home at night. He agreed. They did their night prayer, got up and went home. The next morning the man went to his neighbor’s house again and asked him to go to the mosque. The man said, ‘Leave me alone. This religion is too difficult. I cannot stand it.’ Therefore you should learn not to pressure the people. Do you know that the rule of the Umayyad clan was based upon force, the sword and oppression? However, we rule the people’s hearts with patience, kindness, concealing of faith, good association, piety, and struggling. Try to attract the people to your religion.’”"

God has granted my nation permission to break their fast during illness or on a journey; and the possibility of my intercession on behalf of those who commit a major sin.’The Jew asked, ‘O Muhammad! You are right! What would be the reward of one who recites the Opening Chapter (Al-Hamd)?’ God’s Prophet (MGB) said, ‘The Honorable the Exalted God would grant whomever recites the Opening Chapter of the Book (Al-Fatiha ) the reward of reciting as many as the number of verses which have been revealed from the heavens. And the reward for those of my nation who say the azan would be being resurrected amongst the Prophets, the honest ones, the martyrs and the good-doers. And the reward for the congregational prayer is that the lines of those of my nation who stand to say the congregational prayer is like the line of the angels in the heavens. Each unit of prayer said in a congregational prayer is worth more than twenty-four units of regular prayers. Each unit of congregational prayers is liked by the Honorable the Exalted God more than forty years of worship. And Friday is the day on which God would bring about those of the latter and those of the former times for the Reckoning. The Honorable the Exalted God would give a discount to any believer who goes to the Friday congregational prayers and would reduce his fears on the Resurrection Day and would reward him with Paradise. And the reward for saying the prayers aloud is that the Fire would be put out for as far away as the voice of the one who says the prayers goes. He will also cross the Bridge and have a pleasant entry into Paradise.Regarding the sixth it should be stated that the Honorable the Exalted God would diminish the amount of fear on the Resurrection Day for those of my nation as mentioned in the Holy Quran. And God would make entry into Paradise a certainty for any believer who prays for the deceased unless he is a hypocrite or damned by his parents. Moreover, my intercession for the major sins excludes those who are oppressors and those who associate partners with God.’The Jew said, ‘O Muhammad! You are right! I bear witness that there is no god but God and that you are His servant, His Messenger, the seal of the Prophets and the Leader of the Pious ones.’ He accepted Islam and then brought out a piece of white paper in which all that the Prophet (MGB) saidwas already written. He said, ‘O Prophet of God! I swear by Him who appointed you to the position of Prophethood that I have copied this material from the Tablets which the Honorable the Exalted God had sent to Moses - the son of Imran. I have read in the Torah that no one but you can give the right answers to these questions. O Muhammad! I have read so much about your nobilities in the Torah that I doubted it. I tried to eliminate your name from the Torah for forty years, but it still remains there. I have also read in the Torah that at the time of answering these questions Gabriel shall be on your right side, Michael shall be on your left side, and your Trustee shall be in front of you.’ The Prophet (MGB) said, ‘You are right! This is Gabriel on my right side. This is Michael on my left side. And this is my Trustee Ali ibn Abi Talib who is in front of you.’ The Jew truly accepted Islam."

The first one of them is associating partners with God; killing which God has forbidden; devouring an orphan’s properties; damnation of parents; accusing pious womenof fornication; escaping from a holy war; and denying our rightfulness. Regarding associating partners with God there are several verses revealed by the Honorable the Exalted God regarding us, and the Prophet (MGB) has also made clear announcements in this regard. They have denied God and His Prophet and have thus associated partners with the Honorable the Exalted God. They prescribed ‘killing’ which God has forbidden and killed Al-Hussein ibn Ali (MGB) and his companions. Regarding ‘devouring the properties of an orphan’, they took the one-fifth share that was ours and gave it to others. Regarding ‘damnation of parents’ we know that the Honorable the Exalted God revealed the following in His Book, ‘The Prophet is closer to the Believers than their own selves, and his wives are their mothers…’ And God’s Prophet (MGB) damned them regarding his progeny, and their mother being Khadijah damned them regarding her progeny. Regarding ‘accusing pious women of fornication’, they surely accused Fatimah (MGB) of such acts from their pulpits. Regarding ‘escaping from a holy war’, they first pledged allegiance to the Commander of the Faithful Ali (MGB) with their own free will and without being pressured, but then they fled from him and abandoned him. And regarding ‘denying our rightfulness’ which is an undisputable certainty.”"

قال: سل عما بدالك يا أخا اليهود؟ قال: إنا نجد في الكتاب أن الله عز وجل إذا بعث نبيا أوحى إليه أن يتخذ من أهل بيته من يقوم بأمر امته من بعده وأن يعهد إليهم فيه عهدا يحتذي عليه ويعمل به في امته من بعده وأن الله عز وجل يمتحن الاوصياء في حياة الانبياء ويمتحنهم بعد وفاتهم فأخبرني كم يمتحن الله الاوصياء في حياة الانبياء؟ وكم يمتحنهم بعد وفاتهم من مرة؟ وإلى ما يصير آخر أمر الاوصياء إذا رضي محنتهم؟فقال له

في حياتهم وأوصياء بعد وفاتهم ويصير طاعة الاوصياء في أعناق الامم ممن يقول بطاعة الانبياء، ثم يمتحن الاوصياء بعدوفاة الانبياء عليهم السلام في سبعة مواطن ليبلو صبرهم، فإذا رضي محنتهم ختم لهم بالسعادة

عبدالمطلب وكبيرهم إلى شهادة أن لا إله إلا الله وأنه رسول الله فامتنعوا من ذلك وأنكروه عليه وهجروه، ونابذوه واعتزلوه واجتنبوه وسائر الناس مقصين له ومخالفين عليه، قد استعظموا ما أورده عليهم مما لم تحتمله قلوبهم وتدركه عقولهم،فأجبت رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله وحدي إلى مادعا إليه مسرعا مطيعا موقنا، لم يتخالجني في ذلك شك، فمكثنا بذلك ثلاث حجج وما على وجه الارض خلق يصلي أو يشهد لرسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله بما آتاه الله غيري وغير ابنة خويلد رحمها الله وقد فعل ثم أقبل عليه السلام على أصحابه فقال: أليس كذلك قالوا: بلى يا أميرالمؤمنين فقال عليه السلام: وأما الثانية يا أخا اليهود فإن قريشا لم تزل تخيل الاراء وتعمل الحيل في قتيل النبي صلى الله عليه وآله حتى كان آخرما اجتمعت في ذلك يوم الدار دار الندوة وإبليس الملعون حاضرفي صورة أعور ثقيف، فلم تزل تضرب أمرها ظهر البطن حتى اجتمعت آراؤها على أن ينتدب من كل فخذ من قريش رجل، ثم يأخذ كل رجل منهم سيفه ثم يأتي النبي صلى الله عليه وآله وهو نائم على فراشه فيضربونه جميعا بأسيافهم ضربة رجل واحد فيقتلوه، وإذا قتلوه منعت قريش رجالها ولم تسلمها فيمضي دمه هدرا، فهبط جبرئيل عيله السلام على النبي صلى الله عليه وآله فأنبأه بذلك وأخبره باليلة التي يجتمعون فيها والساعة التي يأتون فراشه فيها، وأمره بالخروج في الوقت الذي خرج فيه إلى الغار، فأخبرني رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله بالخبر، وأمرني أن أضطجع في مضجعه وأقيه بنفسي، فأسرعت إلى ذلك مطيعا له مسرورا لنفسي بأن اقتل دونه، فمضى عليه السلام لوجهه واضطجعت في مضجعه وأقبلت رجالات قريش موقنة في أنفسها أن تقتل النبي صلى الله عليه وآله فلما استوى بي وبهم البيت الذي أنا فيه ناهضتهم بسيفي فدفعتهم عن نفسي بما قد علمه الله والناس، ثم أقبل عليه السلام على أصحابه فقال: أليس كذلك؟ قالوا: بلى يا أمير المؤمنين،

فعل وأنا أحدث أصاحبي سنا وأقلهم للحرب تجربة فقتل الله عز وجل بيدي وليدا وشبية، سوى من قتلت من جحاجحة قريش في ذلك اليوم، وسوي من أسرت، وكان مني أكثر مما كان من أصحابي واستشهد ابن عمي في ذلك رحمة الله عليه، ثم التفت إلى أصحابه فقال: أليس كذلك قالوا: بلى يا أمير المؤمنين،فقال علي عليه السلام: وأما الرابعة يا أخا اليهود فإن أهل مكة أقبلوا ألينا على بكرة أبيهم قد استحاشوا من يليهم من قبايل العرب وقريش طالبين بثأر مشركي قريش في يوم بدر، فهبط جبرئيل عليه السلام على النبـي صـلى الله عليـه وآلـهفأنبأه بذلك، فذهب النبي صلى الله عليه وآله وعسكر بأصاحبه في سد أحد، وأقبل المشركون إلينا فحملوا ألينا حملة رجل واحد، واستشهد من المسلمين من استشهد، وكان ممن بقي من الهزيمة، وبقيت مع رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله ومضى المهاجرون والانصار إلى منازلهم من المدينة كل يقول: قتلى النبي صلى الله عليه وآلهوقتل أصحابه ثم ضرب الله عز وجل وجوه المشركين وقد جرحت بين يدي رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله نيفا وسبعين جرحة منها هذه وهذه ثم ألقى عليه السلام رداءه وأمر يده على جراحاته وكان مني في ذلك ما على الله عز وجل ثوابه إن شاء الله، ثم التفت عليه السلام إلى أصحابه فقال: أليس كذلك؟ قالوا: بلى يا أمير المؤمنين،فقال عليه السلام: وأما الخامسة يا أخا اليهود فإن قريشا والعرب تجمعت وعقدت بينها عقدا وميثاقا لا ترجع من وجهها حتى تقتل رسول الله وتقتلنا معه معاشر بني عبدالمطلب، ثم أقبلت بحدها وحديدها حتى أناخت عليننا بالمدينة، واثقة بأنفسها فيما توجت له فهبط جبرئيل عليه السلام على النبي صلى الله عليه وآله فأنبأه بذلك فخندق على نفسه ومن معه من المهاجرين والانصار، فقدمت قريش فأقامت على الخندق محاصرة لنا، ترى في النفسها القوة وفينا الضعف ترعد وتبرق ورسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله يدعوها إلى الله عز وجل ويناشدها بالقرابة والرحم فتأبى، ولا يزيدها ذلك إلا عتوا، وفارسها وفارس العرب يومئذ عمرو بن عبدود، يهدر كالبعير المغتلم يدعو إلى البراز ويرتجز ويخطر برمحه مرة وبسيفه مرة لا يقدم عليه مقدم، ولا يطمع فيه طامع، ولا حمية تهيجه ولا بصيرة تشجعه، فأنضني إليه رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله وعممني بيده وأعطاني سيفه هذا، وضرب بيده إلى ذي الفقار، فخرجت إليه ونساء أهل المدينة بواك إشفاقا علي من ابن عبدود، فقتله الله عز وجل بيدي، والعرب لا تعدلها فارسا غيره، وضربني هذه الضربة وأومأ بيده إلى هامته - فهزم الله قريشا والعرب بذلك وبماكان مني فيهم من النكايةثم التفت عليه السلام إلى أصحابه فقال: أليس كذلك؟ قالوا: بلى يا أمير المؤمنينفقال عليه السلام: وأما السادسة يا أخا اليهود فإنا وردنا مع رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله مدينة أصحابك خيبر على رجال من اليهود وفرسانها من قريش وغيرها، فتلقونا بأمثال الجبال من الخيل والرجال والسلاح، وهم في أمنع دار وأكثر عدد، كل ينادي ويدعو ويبادر إلى القتال فلم يبرز إليهم من أصحابي أحد إلا قتلوه حتى إذا احمرت الحدق، ودعيت إلى النزال وأهمت كل امرئ نفسه. والتفت بعض أصحابي إلي بعض وكل يقول: يا أبا الحسن انهض. فأنهضني رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله إلى دارهم فلم يبرز إلي منهم أحد إلا قتلته، ولايثبت لي فارس إلاطحنته ثم شددت عليهم شدة الليث على فريسته، حتى أدخلتهم جوف مدينتهم مسددا عليهم، فاقتلعت باب حصنهم بيدي حتى دخلت عليهم مدينتهم وحدي أقتل من يظهر فيها من رجالها، وأسبي من أجد من نسائها حتى أفتتحها وحدي، ولم يكن لي فيها معاون إلا الله وحده ثم التفت عليه السلام إلى أصحابه فقال: أليس كذلك؟ قالوا: بلى يا أمير المؤمنين، فقال عيه السلام: وأما السابعة يا أخااليهود فإن رسول لله صلى الله عليه وآله لما توجه لفتح مكة أحب أن يعذر إليهم ويدعوهم إلى الله عز وجل آخرا كما دعاهم أو لا فكتب إليهم كتابا يحذرهم فيه وينذرهم عذاب الله ويعدهم الصفح ويمنيهم مغفرة ربهم، ونسخ لهم في آخره سورة براءة ليقرأها عليهم، ثم عرض على جميع أصحابه المضي به فكلهم يرى التثاقل فيه، فلما رأى ذلك ندب منهم رجلا فوجهه به فأتاه جبرئيل فقال: يا محمد لا يؤدي عنك إلا أنت أو رجل منك فأنبأني رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله بذلك ووجهني بكتابه ورسالته إلى أهل مكة قأتيت مكة وأهلها من قد عرفتم ليس منهم أحد إلا ولو قدر أن يضع على كل جبل مني إربا لفعل، ولو أن يبذل في ذلكنفسه وأهله وولده وماله، فبلغتهم رسالة النبي صلى الله عليه وآله وقرأت عليهم كتابه، فكلهم يلقاني بالتهدد والوعيد ويبدى لي البغضاء، ويظهر الشحناء من رجالهم ونسائهم، فكان مني في ذلك ما قد رأيتم، ثم التفت إلى أصحابه فقال: أليس كذلك؟ قالوا: بلى يا أمير المؤمنينفقال عليه السلام: يا أخا اليهود هذه المواطن التي امتحنني فيه ربي عز وجل مع نبيه صلى الله عليه وآله فوجدني فيها كلها بمنه مطيعا، ليس لاحد فيها مثل الذي لي ولو شئت لو صفت ذلك ولكن الله عز وجل نهى عن التزكية. فقالوا: يا أمير المؤمنين: صدقت والله ولقد أعطاك الله عز وجل الفضيلة بالقرابة من نبينا صلى الله عيله وآله وسلم، وأسعدك بأن جعلك أخاه، تنزل منه بمنزلة هارون من موسى، وفضلك بالمواقف التي باشهرتها، والاهوال التي ركبتها، وذخر لك الذي ذكرت وأكثر منه ممالم تذكره، ومما ليس لاحد من المسلمين مثله، يقول ذلك من شهدك منا مع نبينا صلى الله عيله وآله ومن شهدك بعده، فأخبرنا يا أمير المؤمنين ما امتحنك الله عز وجل به بعد نبينا صلى الله عليه وآله فاحتملته وصبرت، فلو شئنا أن نصف ذلك لو صفناه علما منا به وظهورا منا عليه، إلا أنا نحب أن نسمع منك ذلك كما سمعنا منك ما امتحنك الله به في حياته فأطعته فيهفقال عليه السلام: يا أخا اليهود إن الله عز وجل امتحنني بعد وفاة نبيه صلى الله عليه وآله في سبعة مواطن فوجدني فيهن من غير تزكية لنفسي منه ونعمته صبوراواما أولهن يا أخا اليهود فانه لم يكن لي خاصة دون المسلمين عامة أحد آنس به أو أعتمد عليه أو أستنيم إليه أو أتقرب به غير رسول الله صلى الله علية وآله، هو رباني صغيرا وبوأني كبيرا، وكفاني العيلة، وجبرني من اليتم، وأغناني عن الطلب ووقاني المكسب. وعال لي النفس والولد والاهل هذا في تصاريف أمر الدنيامع ما خصني به من الدرجات التي قادتني إلى معالي الحق عند الله عز وجل فنزل بي من وفاة رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله مالم أكن أظن الجبال لو حملته عنوة كانت تنهض به فرأيت الناس من أهل بيتي ما بين جازع لا يملك جزعه، ولا بضبط نفسه، ولا يقوي على حمل فادح ما نزل به قد أذهب الجزع صبره، وأذهل عقله، وحال بينه وبين الفهم والافهام والقول والاسماع، وسائر الناس من غير بني عبدالمطلب بين معز يأمر بالصبر، وبين مساعد باك البكائهم،جازع لجزعهم، وحملت نفسي على الصبر عند وفاته بلزوم الصمت والاشتغال بما أمرنى به من تجهيزه، وتغسيله وتحنيطه وتكفينه، والصلاة عليه، ووضعه في حفرته، وجمع كتاب الله وعهده إلى خلقه، لا يشغلني عن ذلك بادر دمعة ولا هائج زفرة ولا لاذع حرقة ولا جزيل مصيبة حتى أديت في ذلك الحق الواجب لله عز وجل ولرسوله صلى الله عليه وآله علي، وبلغت منه الذي أمرني به، واحتملته صابرا محتسبا، ثم التفت عليه السلام إلى أصحابه فقال: أليس كذلك؟ قالوا: بلى يا أمير المؤمنينفقال عليه السلام: وأما الثانية يا أخا اليهود،فإن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله أمرني في حياته على جميع امته وأخذ على جميع من حضره منهم البيعة والسمع والطاعة لامري، وأمرهم أن يبلغ الشاهد الغائب ذلك، فكنت المؤدى إليهم عن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله أمره إذا حضرته والامير على من حضرني منهم إذا فارقته، لا تختلج في نفسي منازعة أحد من الخلق لي في شيء من الامر في حياة النبي صلى الله عليه وآله ولا بعد وفاته، ثم أمر رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله بتوجيه الجيش الذي وجهه مع اسامة بن زيد عند الذي أحدث الله به من المرض الذي توفاه فيه، فلم يدع النبي أحدا من أفناء العرب ولا من الاوس والخزرج وغيرهم من سائر الناس ممن يخاف على نقضه ومنازعته ولا أحدا ممن يراني بعيـنالبغضاء ممن قد وترته بقتل أبيه أو أخيه أوحميمه إلا وجهه في ذلك الجيش، ولا من المهاجرين والانصار والمسلمين وغيرهم والمؤلفة قلوبهم والمنافقين، لتصفو قلوب من يبقى معي بحضرته، ولئلا يقول قائل شيئا مما أكرهه، ولا يدفعني دافع من الولاية والقيام بأمر رعيته من بعده، ثم كان آخر ما تكلم به في شيء من أمر امته أن يمضي جيش اسامة ولا يتخلف عنه أحد ممن أنهض معه، وتقدم في ذلك أشد التقدم وأوعز فيه أبلغ الايعاز وأكد فيه أكثر التأكيد فلم أشعر بعد أن قبض النبي صلى الله عليه وآله إلا برجال من بعث اسامة بن زيد وأهل عسكره قد تركوا مراكزهم، وأخلوا مواضعهم، وخالفوا أمر رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله فيما أنهضهم له وأمرهم به وتقدم إليهم من ملازمة أميرهم مقيما في عسكره، وأقبلوا يتبادرون على الخيل ركضا إلى حل عقدة عقدها الله عز وجل لي ولرسول صلى الله عليه وآله في أعناقهم فحلوها، وعهد عاهدوا الله ورسوله فنكثوه، وعقدوا لانفسهم عقدا ضجت به أصواتهم واحتصت به آراؤهم من غير مناظرة لاحد من ابني عبدالمطلب أو مشاركة في رأي أو استقالة لما في أعناقهم من بيعتى، فعلو ذلك وأنا برسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله مشغول وبتجهيزه عن سائر الاشياء مصدود فإنه كان أهمها وأحق ما بدئ به منها، فكان هذا يا أخا اليهود أقرح ما ورد على قلبي مع الذي أنا فيه من عظيم الرزية، وفاجع المصيبة، وفقد من لاخلف منه إلا الله تبارك وتعالى، فصبرت عليها إذا أتت بعد أختها على تقاربها وسرعة اتصالها، ثم التفت عليه السلام إلى أصحابه فقال: أليس كذالك؟ قالوا: بلى ياأمير المؤمنين،فقال عليه السلام وأما الثالثة يا أخا اليهود فإن القائم بعد النبي صلى الله عليه وآله كان يلقاني معتذرا في كل أيامه ويلوم غيره ما ارتكبه من أخذ حقي ونقض بيعتي وسألني تحليله، فكنت أقول: تنقضي أيامه، ثم يرجع إلي حقي الذي جعله الله لى عفوا هنيئا من غير أن أحدث في الاسلام مع حدوثه وقرب عهده بالجاهلية حدثا في طلب حقي بمنازعة لعل فلانا يقول فيها: نعم وفلانا يقول: لا، فيؤول ذلك من القول إلى الفعل وجماعة من خواص أصحاب محمد صلى الله عليه وآله أعرفهمبالنصح لله ولرسوله ولكتابه ودينه الاسلام يأتوني عودا وبدءا وعلانية وسرا فيدعوني إلى أخذ حقي، ويبذلون أنفسهم في نصرتي ليؤدوا إلى بذلك بيعتى في أعناقهم، فأقول رويدا وصبرا لعل الله يأتينى بذلك عفوا بلا منازعة ولا إراقة الدماء، فقد ارتاب كثير من الناس بعد وفاة النبي صلى الله عليه وآله، وطمع في الامر بعده من ليس له بأهل فقال كل قوم: منا أمير، وما طمع القائلون في ذلك إلا لتناول غيري الامر، فلما دنت وفاة القائم وانقضت أيامه صير الامر بعده لصاحبه، فكانت هذه اخت اختها، ومحلها مني مثل محلها وأخذامني ماجعله الله لي، فاجتمع إلى من أصحاب محمد صلى الله عليه وآله ممن مضى وممن بقي ممن أخره الله من اجتمع فقالوا لى فيها مثل الذي قالوا في اختها، فلم يعد قولي الثاني قولي الاول صبرا واحتسابا ويقينا وإشفاقا من أن تفنى عصبة تألفهم رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله بالين مرة وبالشدة اخرى، وبالنذر مرة وبالسيف اخرى حتى لقد كان من تألفه لهم أن كان الناس في الكر والفرار والشبع والري، واللباس والوطاء والدثار ونحن أهل بيت محمد صلى الله عليه وآله لا سقوف لبيوتنا، ولا أبواب ولاستور إلا الجرائد، وما أشبهها ولا وطاء لنا ولا دثار علينا، يتدوال الثوب الواحد في الصلاة أكثرنا، ونطوي الليالي والايام عامتنا، وربما أتا نا الشئ مما أفاءه الله علينا وصيره لنا خاصة دون غير نا ونحن على ما وصفت من حالنا فيؤثر به رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله أرباب النعم والاموال تألفا منه لهم، فكنت أحق من لم يفرق هذه العصبة التى ألفها رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله ولم يحملها على الخطة التي لاخلاص لها منها دون بلوغها أوفناء آجالها لاني لو نصبت نفسي فدعوتهم إلى نصرتي كانوا منى وفي أمري على إحدى منزلتين إما متبع مقاتل، وإما مقتول إن لم يتبع الجميع، وإما خاذل يكفر بخذلانه إن قصر في نصرتي أو أمسك عن طاعتي، وقد علم الله أني منه بمنزلة هارون من موسى، يحل به في مخالفتي والامساك عن نصرتي ما أحل قوم موسى بأنفسهم في مخالفة هارون وترك طاعته ورأيت تجرع الغصص ورد أنفاس الصعداء ولزوم الصبر حتى يفتح الله أو يقضى بما أحب أزيدلي في حظي وأرفق بالعصابة التي وصفت أمرهم ""وَكَانَ أَمْرُ اللهِ قَدَراً مَقْدُوراً .""ولو لم أتق هذه الحالة يا أخا اليهود - ثم طلبت حقي لكنت أولى ممن طلبه لعلم من مضى من أصحاب رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله ومن بحضرتك منه بأني كنت أكثر عددا وأعز عشيرة وأمنع رجالا وأطوع أمرا وأوضح حجة وأكثر في هذا الدين مناقب وآثارا لسوابقي وقرابتي ووراثتي فضلا عن استحقاقي ذلك بالوصية التي لا مخرج للعباد منها والبيعة المتعدمة في أعناقهم ممن تناولها، وقد قبض محمد صلى الله عليه وآله وإن ولاية الامة في يده وفي بيته، لا في يد الاولى تناولوها ولا في بيوتهم، ولاهل بيته الذين أذهب الله عنهم الرجس وطهرهم تطهيرا أولى بالامر من بعده من غيرهم في جميع الخصال ثم التفت عليه السلام إلى أصحابه فقال: أليس كذلك؟ فقالو: بلى يا أمير المؤمنين. فقال عليه السلام: وأما الرابعة يا أخا اليهود فإن القائم بعد صاحبه كان يشاورني في موارد الامور فيصدرها عن أمري ويناظرني في غوامضها فيمضيها عن رأيي، أعلم أحدا ولايعلمه أصحابي يناظره في ذلك غيري، ولا يطمع في الامر بعده سواي، فلما (أن) أتته منيته على فجأة بلامرض كان قبله ولا أمر كان أمضاه في صحته من بدنه لم أشك أني قد استرجعت حقي في عافية بالمنزلة التى كنت أطلبها، والعاقبة التي كنت ألتمسها وإن الله سيأتي بذلك على أحسن مارجوت، وأفضل ما أملت، وكان من فعله أن ختم أمره بأن سمى قوما أنا سادسهم، ولم يستوني بواحد منهم، ولا ذكرلي حالا في وراثة الرسول ولا قرابة ولاصهر ولانسب، ولا لواحد منهم مثل سابقة من سوابقي ولاأثر من آثارى، وصير هاشورى بيننا وصير ابنه فيها حاكما علينا وأمره أن يضرب أعناق النفر الستة الذين صير الامر فيهم إن لم ينفذوا أمره، وكفى بالصبر على هذا يا أخا اليهود صبرا وبسط الايدي والالسن في الامر والنهي والركون إلى الدنيا والاقتداء بالماضين قبلهم إلى تناول ما لم يجعلالله لهم، فمكث القوم أيامهم كلها كل يخطب لنفسه وأنا ممسك عن أن سألوني عن أمري فناظرتهم في أيامي وأيامهم وآثارى وآثارهم، وأوضحت لهم مالم يجهلوه من وجوه استحقاقي لها دونهم وذكر تهم عهد رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله إليهم وتأكيد ما أكده من البيعة لى في أعناقهم، دعاهم حب الامارة فاذا خلوت بالواحد ذكرته أيام الله وحذرته ما هوقادم عليه وصائر إليه، التمس مني شرطا أن اصيرهاله بعدي فلما لم يجدوا عندي إلا المحجة البيضاء، والحمل على كتاب الله عز وجل ووصية الرسول وإعطاء كل امرئ منهم ماجعله الله له، ومنعه مالم يجعل الله له أزالها عني إلى ابن عفان طمعا في الشحيح معه فيها، وابن عفان رجل لم يستوبه وبواحد ممن حضره حال قط فضلا عمن دونهم لاببدر التى هى سنام فخرهم ولا غيرها من المآثر التي أكرم الله بها رسوله ومن اختصه معه من أهل بيته عليه السلام ثم لم أعلم القوم أمسوا من يومهم ذلك حتى ظهرت ندامتهم ونكصوا على أعقابهم وأحال بعضهم على بعض، كل يلوم نفسه ويلوم أصحابه، ثم لم تطل الايام بالمستبد بالامر ابن عفان حتى أكفروه وتبرؤو امنه مشى إلى أصحابه خاصة وسائر أصحاب رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله عامة يستقيلهم من بيعته ويتوب إلى الله من فلتته، فكانت هذه ياأخا اليهود أكبر من اختها وأفظع وأحرى أن لا يصبر عليها، فنالني منها الذي لا يبلغ وصفه ولا يحد وقته، ولم يكن عندي فيها إلا الصبر على ما أمض وأبلغ منها، ولقد أتاني الباقون من الستة من يومهم كل راجع عما كان ركب مني يسألني خلع ابن عفان والوثوب عليه وأخذ حقي ويؤتيني صفقته وبيعته على الموت تحت رايتي أويرد الله عز وجل على حقي، فوالله يا أخا اليهود ما منعني منا إلا الذي منعني من اختيها قبلها، ورأيت الابقاء على من بقي من الطائفة أبهج لي وآنس لقلبي من فنائها، وعلمت أني إن حـملتها عـلىدعوة الموت ركبتة، فأما نفسي فقد علم من حضر ممن ترى ومن غاب من أصحاب محمد صلى الله عليه وآله أن الموت عندي بمنزلة الشربة الباردة في اليوم الشديد الحر من ذي العطش الصدى،ولقد كنت عاهدت الله عز وجل ورسوله صلى الله عليه وآله أنا وعمي حمزة وأخي جعفر، وابن عمي عبيدة على أمر وفينا به لله عز وجل ولرسوله، فتقد مني أصحابي وتخلفت بعدهم لما أراد الله عز وجل فأنزل الله فينا ""مِنْ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ رِجَالٌ صَدَقُوا مَا عَاهَدُوا اللَّهَ عَلَيْهِ فَمِنْهُمْ مَنْ قَضَى نَحْبَهُ وَمِنْهُمْ مَنْ يَنْتَظِرُ وَمَا بَدَّلُوا تَبْدِيلاً."" وأنا والله والمنتظريا أخا اليهود، وما بدلت تبديلا، وما سكتني عن ابن عفان وحثني على الامساك عنه إلا أني عرفت من أخلاقه فيما اختبرت منه بمالن يدعة حتى يستدعي الاباعد إلى قتله وخلعه فضلا عن الاقارب وأنا في عزلة، فصبرت حتى كان ذلك، لم أنطلق فيه بحرف من ""لا""، ولا ""نعم "".ثم أتاني القوم وأن اعلم الله كاره لمعرفتي بما تطاعموا به من اعتقال الامول والمرح في الارض وعلمهم بأن تلك ليست لهم عندي وشديد عادة منتزعة فلما لم يجدوا عندي تعللوا الاعاليلثم التفت عليه السلام إلى أصحابه فقال: أليس كذلك؟ فقالوا: بلى يا أمير المؤمنينفقال عليه السلام: وأما الخامسة يا أخا اليهود فإن المتابعين لي لما لم يطمعوا في تلك مني وثبوا بالمرأة على وأنا ولي أمرها، والوصي عليها، فحملوها على الجمل وشدوها على الرحال، وأقبلوا بها تخبط الفيافي وتقطع البراري وتنبح عليها كلاب الحوأب، وتظهر لهم علامات الندم في كل ساعة وعند كل حال في عصبة قد بايعوني ثانية بعد بيعتهم الاولى في حيـاة النبـي صلى الله عليه وآله حتى أتت أهلبلدة قصيرة أيديهم، طويلة لحاهم، قليلة عقولهم عازبة آراؤهم، وهم جيران بدو ووراد بحر، فأخرجتهم يخبطون بسيوفهم من غير علم، ويرمون بسهامهم بغير فهم، فوقت من أمرهم على اثنتين كلتاهما في محلة المكروه ممن إن كففت لم يرجع ولم يعقل، وإن أقمت كنت قد صرت إلى التي كرهت فقدمت الحجة بالاعذار والانذار، ودعوت المرأة إلى الرجوع إلى بينها، والقوم الذين حملوها على الوفاء ببيعتهم لي، والترك لنقضهم عهدالله عز وجل في، وأعطيتهم من نفسي كل الذي قدرت عليه، وناظرت بعضهم فرجع وذكرت فذكر، ثم أقبلت على الناس بمثل ذلك فلم يزدادوا إلا جهلا وتماديا وغيا، فلما أبوا إلا هي، ركبتها منه فكانت عليهم الدبرة، وبهم الهزيمة، ولهم الحسرة، وفيهم الفناء والقتل، وحملت نفسي على التي لم أجد منها بدا،ولم يسعني إذ فعلت ذلك وأظهرته آخرا مثل الذي وسعني منه أولا من الاغضاء والامساك ورأيتني إن أمسكت كنت معينا لهم علي بامساكي على ماصاروا إليه وطمعوا فيه من تناول الاطراف، وسفك الدماء وقتل الرعية وتحكيم النساء النواقص العقول والحظوظ على كل حال، كعادة بنى الاصفر ومن مضى من ملوك سبأ والامم الخالية فأصير إلى ما كرهت أولا وآخرا، وقد أهملت المرأة وجندها يفعلون ما وصفت بين الفريقين من الناس، ولم أهجم على الامر إلا بعدما قدمت وأخرت، وتأنيت وراجعت، وأرسلت وسافرت، وأعذرت وأنذرت وأعطيت القوم كل شيء يلتمسوه بعد أن عرضت عليهم كل شيء لم يلتمسوه، فلما أبوا إلا تلك، أقدمت عليها، فبلغ الله بي وبهم ما أراد، وكان لي عليهم بما كان مني إليهم شهيداثم التفت عليه السلام إلى أصحابه فقال: أليس كذلك؟ قالوا: بلى يا أمير المؤمنينفقال عليه السلام: وأما السادسة يا أخا اليهود فتحكيمهم [الحكمين] ومحاربة ابن آكلة الاكباد وهو طليق معاند لله عز وجل ولرسوله والمؤمنين منذ بعث الله محمدا إلى أن فتح الله عليه مكة عنوةفاخذت بيعته وبيعة أبيه لي معه في ذلك اليوم وفي ثلاثة مواطن بعده، وأبوه بالامس أؤل من سلم على بإمرة المؤمنين، وجعل يحثني على النهوض في أخذ حقي من الماضين قبلى، ويجد دلي وبيعته كلما أتانيوأعجب العجب أنه لما رأى ربي تبارك وتعالى قد رد إليّ حقي وأقرفي معدنه، وانقطع طمعه أن يصير في دين الله رابعا وفي أمانة حملناها حكاما، كرا على العاصي ابن العاص فاستما له فمال إليه، ثم أقبل به بعد أن أطمعه مصر، وحرام عليه أن يأخذ من الفيء دون قمسه درهما، وحرام والانباء تأتيني والاخبار ترد علي بذلك، فأتاني أعور ثقيف فأشار علي أن أولي الراعي إيصال درهم إليه فوق حقه، فأقيل يخبط البلاد بالظلم ويطأها بالغشم، فمن بايعه أرضاه، ومن خالفه ناواه، ثم توجه إلي ناكثا علينا مغيرا في البلاد شرقا وغربا ويمينا وشمالا، ، والانباء تأتيني والاخبار ترد علي بذلك ، فأتاني أعور ثقيف فأشار علي أن اوليه البلاد التي هوبها لاداريه بما اوليه منها وفي الذي أشار به الراي في أمر الدنيا لو وجدت عند الله عز وجل في توليته لي مخرجا، وأصبت لنفسي في ذلك عذرا، فأعلمت الرأي في ذلك، وشاورت من أثق بنصيحته لله عز وجل ولرسوله صلى الله عليه وآله ولي وللمؤمنين فان رأيه في ابن آكلة الاكباد كرأيي، ينهاني عن توليته ويحذرني أن ادخل في أمر المسلمين يده، ولم يكن الله ليراني أتخذ المضلين عضدافوجهت إليه أخا بجيلة مرة وأخا الاشعريين مرة كلاهما ركن إلى الدنيا وتابع هواه فيما أرضاه، فلما لم أراه [أن] يزداد فيما انتهك من محارم الله ألا تماديا شـــاورتمن معي من أصحاب محمد صلى الله عليه وآله البدريين والذين ارتضى الله عز وجل أمرهم ورضي عنهم بعد بيعتهم، وغيرهم من صلحاء المسلمين والتابعين فكل يوافق رأيه رأيي في غزوه ومحاربته ومنعه مما نالت يده، وإني نهضت إليه بأصحابى، أنفذ إليه من كل موضع كتبى وأوجه إليه رسلي أدعوه إلى الرجوع عما فو فيه، والدخول فيما فيه الناس معي، فكتب يتحكم علي ويتمنى علي الاماني ويشترط علي شروطا لا يرضاها الله عز وجل ورسوله ولا المسلمون، ويشترط في بعضها أن أدفع إليه أقواما من أصحاب محمد صلى الله عليه وآله أبرارا، فيهم عمار بن ياسر، وأين مثل عمار؟ والله لقد رأيتنا مع النبي صلى الله عليه وآله وما يعد منا خمسة إلا كان سادسهم، ولا أربعة إلا كان خامسهم، اشترط دفعهم إليه ليقتلهم ويصلبهم وانتحل دم عثمان، ولعمرد الله ما ألب على عثمان ولا جمع الناس على قتله إلا هو وأشباهه من أهل بيته أغصان الشجرة الملعونة في القرآن، فلما لم اجب إلى ما اشترط من ذلك كر مستعليا في نفسه بطغيانه وبغيه بحمير لاعقول لهم ولا بصائر، فموه لهم أمرا فاتبعوه، وأعطاهم من الدنيا ما أمالهم به إليه، فناجزناهم وحاكمناهم إلى الله عز وجل بعد الاعذار والانذار فلما لم يزده ذلك إلا تماديا وبغيا لقيناه بعادة الله التي عودناه من النصر على أعدائه وعدونا، وراية رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله بأيدنا، لم يزل الله تبارك وتعالى يفل حزب الشيطان بهاحتى يقضي الموت عليه، وهو معلم رايات أبيه التى لم أزل أقاتلها مع رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله في كل المواطن، فلم يجدمن الموت منجى إلا الهرب فركب فرسه وقلب رايته، لا يدري كيف يحتال فاستعان برأي ابن العاص فأشار عليه بإظهار المصاحف ورفعها علي الاعلام والدعاء إلى ما فيها وقال: إن ابن أبيطالب وحزبه أهل بصائر ورحمة وتقيا وقد دعوك إلى كتاب الله أولا وهم مجيبوك إليه آخرا فأطاعه فيما أشاربه عليه إذا رأى أنه لا منجى له من القتل أو الهرب غيره، فرفع المصاحف يدعو إلى ما فيها بزعمه، فمالت إلى المصاحف قلوب ومن بقي من أصحابي بعدفناء أخيارهم وجهدهم في جها أعداء الله وأعدائهم على بصائر هم وظنوا أن ابن آكلة الاكباد له الوفاء بما دعا إليه، فأصغوا إلى دعوته وأقبلوا بأجمعهم في إجابته فأعلمتهم أن ذلك منه مكرو من ابن العاص معه وأنهما إلى النكث أقرب منهما إلى الوفاء، فلم يقبلوا قولي ولم يطيعوا أمري، وأبوا إلا أجابته كرهت أم هويت، شئت أو أبيت حى أخذ بعضهم يقول لبعض: إن لم يفعل فألحقوه بان عفان أو ادفعوه إلى ابن هند برمته. فجهد تعلم الله جهدي ولم أدع غلة في نفسى إلا بلغتها في أن يخلوني ورأيى فلم يفعلوا، وراودتهم على الصبر على مقدار فواق الناقة أو ركضة الفرس فلم يجيبوا ما خلاهذا الشيخ (وأو مأبيده إلى الاشتر) وعصبة من أهل بيتي، فوالله ما منعني أن أمضي على بصيرتي إلا مخافة أن يقتل هذان وأومأ بيده إلى الحسن والحسين عليه السلام - فينقطع نسل رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله وذريته من أمته ومخافة أن يقتل هذا وهذا وأومأ بيده إلى عبد الله بن جعفر ومحمد بن الحنفية رضي الله عنهما فإني أعلم لو لا مكاني لم يقفا ذلك الموقف فلذلك صبرع على ما أراد القوم مع ما سبق فيه من علم الله عز وجل فلما رفعنا عن القوم سيوفنا تحكموا في الامور وتخيروا الاحكام والآراء وتركوا المصاحف وما دعوا إليه من حكم القرآن، وما كنت أحكم في دين الله أحدا إذا كان التحكيم في ذلك الخطأ الذي لا شك فيه ولا امتراء، فلما أبوا إلا ذلك أردت أن احكم رجلا من أهل بيتي أو رجلا ممن أرضي رأية وعقله وأثق بنصيحته ومودته ودينهوأقبلت لا اسمي أحذا إلا امتنع منه ابن هند ولا أدعوه إلى شيء من الحق إلا أدبر عنه، وأقبل ابن هند يسومنا عسفا، وما ذاك إلا باتباع أصحابي له على ذلك فلمـاأبوا إلا غلبتي على التحكم تبرأت إلى الله عز وجل منهم وفوضت ذلك إليهم فقلدوه امرءا فخدعه ابن العاص خديعة ظهرت في شرق الارض وغربها، وأظهر المخدوع عليها ندماثم أقبل عليه السلام على أصحابه فقال: أليس كذلك قالوا: بلى يا أميرالمؤمنينفقال عليه السلام وأما السابعة يا أخا اليهود فإن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله كان عهد إلى أن أقاتل في آخر الزمان من أيامي قوما من أصحابي يصومون النهار ويقومون الليل ويتلون الكتاب، يمرقون بخلافهم علي ومحاربتهم إياي من الدين مروق السهم من الرمية، فيهم ذوالثدية يختم لى بقتلهم بالسعادة فلما انصرفت إلى موضعي هذا يعني بعد الحكمين أقبل بعض القوم على بعض باللائمة فيما صاروا إليه من تحكيم الحكمين، فلم يجدوا لانفسهم من ذلك مخرجا إلا أن قالوا: كان ينبغي لاميرنا أن لا يبايع من أخطأ وأن يقضى بحقيقة رأيه على قتل نفسه وقتل من خالفه منا فقد كفر بمتابعته إيانا وطاعته لنا في الخطأ، وأحل لنا بذلك قتله وسفك دمه، فتجمعوا على ذلك وخرجوا راكبين رؤوسهم ينادون بأعلى أصواتهم: لا حكم إلا لله،ثم تفرقوا فرقة بالنخيلة واخرى بحروراء واخرى راكبة رأسها تخبط الارض شرقاحتى عبرت دجلة، فلم تمر بمسلم إلا امتحنته، فمن تابعها استحيته، ومن خالفها قتلته، فخرجت إلى الاوليين واحدة بعد اخرى أدعوهم إلى طاعه الله عز وجل ومتابعه الحق والرجوع إليه فأبيا إلا السيف لا يقنعهما غير ذلك، فلما أعيت الحيلة فيهما حاكمتهما إلى الله عز وجل فقتل الله هذه وهذه وكانوا - يا أخا اليهود لولا مافعلوا لكانوا ركنا قويا وسدا منيعا، فأبى الله إلا ما صاروا إليه، ثم كتبت إلى الفرقة الثالثة ووجهت رسلي تتـرى وكـانوا مـنجلة أصحابي وأهل التعبد منهم والزهد في الدنيا فأبت إلا اتباع اختيها والاحتذاء على مثالهما وأسرعت في قتل من خالفهامن المسلمين وتتابعت إلى الاخبار بفعلهم، فخرجت حتى قطعت إليهم دجلة، أوجه السفراء والنصحاء وأطلب العتبي بجهدي بهذا مرة وبهذا مرة أو مأبيده إلى الاشتر، والاحنف بن قيس، وسعيد بن قيس الارحبي والاشعث بن قيس الكندي فلما أبوا إلا تلك ركبتها منهم فقتلهم الله يا أخا اليهودعن آخرهم، وهم أربعة آلاف أو يزيدون حتى لم يفلت منهم مخبر، فاستخرجت ذا الندية من قتلاهم بحضرة من ترى، له ثدي كثدي المرأة ثم التفت عليه السلام إلى أصحابه فقال، أليس كذلك؟ قالوا، بلى يا أمير المؤمين، فقال عليه السلام: قد وفيت سبعا وسبعا يا أخا اليهود، وبقيت الاخرى وأوشك بهافكان قد. فبكى أصحاب علي عليه السلام وبكى رأس اليهود وقالوا: يا أمير المؤنين أخبرنا بالاخرى فقال: الاخرى أن تخضب هذه وأو مأبيده إلى لحيتهمن هذه أو مأبيده إلى هامته، قال: وارتفعت أصوات الناس في المسجد الجامع بالضجة والبكاء حتى ليم يبق بالكوفة دار إلاخرج أهلها فزعا، وأسلم رأس اليهود على يدي علي عليه السلام من ساعته ولم يزل مقيما حتى قتل أمير المؤمنين عليه السلام وأخذ ابن ملجم لعنه الله فأقبل رأس اليهود حتى وقف على الحسن عليه السلام والناس حوله وابن ملجم لعنه الله بين يديه فقال له: يا أبا محمد اقتله قتله الله، فإني رأيت في الكتب التي انزلت على موسى عليه السلام أن هذا أعظم عند الله عز وجل جرما من ابن آدم قاتل أخيه ومن القدار عاقر ناقة ثمود","7-59 (The compiler of the book narrated) that his father and Muhammad ibn al-Hassan - may God be pleased with them - narrated that Sa’ed ibn Abdullah quoted Ahmad ibn al-Hussein ibn Sa’id, on the authority of Ja’far ibn Muhammad al-Nowfali, on the authority of Yaqoob ibn Yazid, on the authority of Abu Abdullah Ja’far ibn Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Isa ibn Muhammad ibn Ali ibn Abdullah ibn Ja’far ibn Abi Talib,on the authority of Yaqoob ibn Abdullah al-Kufy, on the authority of Musa ibn Ubaydah, on the authority of Amr ibn Abil Miqdam, on the authority of Abi Ishaq, on the authority of Al-Harith, on the authority of Muhammad ibn al-Hanifa –may God be pleased with him - and Umar ibn Abil Miqdam, on the authority of Jabir al-Jo’afy, on the authority of Abi Ja’far al-Baqir (MGB), “The head of the Jews came to Ali ibn Abi Talib (MGB) when he (MGB) returned from the Nahravan Battle. Ali (MGB) was sitting in the Kufa Mosque. He said, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! I wish to ask you several questions regarding things which only the Prophets or their Trustees would know.’ The Commander of the Faithful (MGB) said, ‘O Jewish brother! Ask whatever you want to ask.’The Jew said, ‘We have seen in our religious books that whenever the Honorable the Exalted God appoints someone as a Prophet (MGB), He orders him to choose a member of His Household as his Trustee to be in charge of the affairs of his nation after him.God tests the Prophets’ (MGB) Trustees during their life, and also tests the Trustees (MGB) after the death of the Prophets (MGB). Tell me that how many times are the Trustees tested during the Prophets’ (MGB) lifetimes, and how many times are they tested after their death. If the Trustees do well in these testes, what will be their end?’Ali (MGB) said, ‘I swear by the right of God who split the sea for the Israelites and sent the Torah to Moses (MGB)! Will you confirm the truth if I say it?’ The Jew replied, ‘Yes; I will.’Again Ali (MGB) said, ‘I swear by the right of God who split the sea for the Israelites and sent the Torah to Moses (MGB)! Will you submit to Islam if I tell the truth?’ Again the Jew replied, ‘Yes; I will.’Then Ali (MGB) said, ‘Indeed the Honorable the Exalted God would test the Trustees of the Prophets on seven occasions during the lifetimes of the Prophets in order to see their obedience. Then if God is pleased with their obedience, God will advise the Prophets to establish their Trustees as their friends during their lifetimes, and as their Trustees after their demise. God will make it necessary for all the nations who follow the Prophet to obey his Trustee as they obeyed the Prophet. Then God would test the Trustees on seven occasions after the demise of the Prophet in order to test their perseverance and tolerance. Then when God is satisfied with them, they will have a prosperous ending and will join the Prophets. Indeed they will attain perfect prosperity.’The head of the Jews said, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! You are right! Please tell me how many times did God test you during the lifetime of Muhammad (MGB) and how many times will God test you after his death? What will be your ending?’Ali (MGB) extended his hand; took the Jew’s hand and said, ‘O Jewish brother! Please let’s go so that I may inform you about this subject.’ A group of Ali (MGB)’s companions ran ahead and said, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! Please let us be with him and hear the answer.’The Commander of the Faithful (MGB) said, ‘I am afraid you cannot tolerate to hear this.’ They said, ‘O Commander of the Faithful (MGB)! Why?’ He (MGB) replied, ‘Since I have seen and heard a lot about you.’ Then Malik Ashtar stepped forward and said, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! Please also inform us of the subject. I swear to God that we believe that there is no Trustee on the Earth for the Prophet (MGB) but you. We believe that God will not send a Prophet after our Prophet. It is incumbent upon us to obey you and obeying you is connected to obeying our Prophet (MGB).’ Ali (MGB) accepted Malik Ashtar’s request. Then Ali (MGB) sat down facing the Jew and said, ‘O Jewish brother! Indeed the Honorable the Exalted God tested me on seven occasions during the lifetime of the Prophet (MGB). I say this without praising myself. God found me obeying God’s blessing.’ The Jew said, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! On what occasions did God test you?’The Commander of the Faithful (MGB) said, ‘The first occasion was when the Honorable the Exalted God sent down revelations to the Prophet (MGB) and appointed him as the Prophet. As the youngest man in the house, I was with him and served him by doing whatever he ordered me to do. He (MGB) proposed to all the small and old men of the Abdul Mutalib household to submit to Islam by bearing testimony that ‘There is no god but God’ and that ‘He (MGB) is the Prophet of God’. They all rejected this subject and confronted him. They cut off associating with him. They turned away from and abandoned him. Other people also abandoned him and argued with him. They considered what had been suggested to them too great, since they could not tolerate it and their minds could not understand it. I was the only man who rushed to accept him through my belief and let no doubt in my heart. We had this belief for three years. No one except the Prophet (MGB), me and Khadijah - the daughter of Khuwaylid existed on the Earth who prayed and testified to the Prophethood.’Then Ali (MGB) turned towards his companions and asked, ‘Was it not so?’ They replied, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! Yes, it was so.’ Then the Commander of the Faithful (MGB) said, ‘O Jewish brother! And about the second occasion I should say that the Quraysh always plotted and tried to find ways to kill the Prophet (MGB). Finally their decision was to take part in a consultation session in one of the homes with the presence of the damnedSatan who had participated there looking like a one-eyed man from the Al-Saqaf. They collectively voted that each sect of the Quraysh should dispatch one man as their representative. Each one should take a sword and collectively attack the Prophet (MGB) and kill him. They thought that this way each of the sects of the Quraysh would support its representative and not surrender him to be punished and thus Muhammad’s blood would be shed without any punishment for it. Then Gabriel (MGB) descended down to the Prophet (MGB) and informed him of the plot of the Quraysh and the night they plan to attack and the hour of their attack. Gabriel ordered the Prophet (MGB) to leave his house at that time and go and hide in a cave. God’s Prophet (MGB) called me in and told me the news. He (MGB) ordered me to sleep in his bed and risk my life for him. I immediately accepted this and was happy to be killed instead of him (MGB). The Prophet (MGB) went away and I slept in his bed and encountered the men of the Quraysh who thought they were going to kill the Prophet (MGB). They entered the house and I unsheathed my sword when I faced them in the house I was in, and fought them as God and the people know.’Then Ali (MGB) turned towards his companions and asked, ‘Was it not so?’ They replied, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! Yes, it was so.’Then the Commander of the Faithful (MGB) said, ‘O Jewish brother! And about the third occasion I should say that the two sons of Rabia and the son of Ataba were from the strongest men of the Quraysh. They entered the battlefield during the Battle of Badr and challenged us, but no one from the Quraysh was able to face them. God’s Prophet (MGB) sent me and two of my friends - may God be pleased with them - to fight with them. I was the youngest of them and the least experienced one in fighting. However, the Honorable the Exalted God had Valid (Ibn Ataba) and Shayba (Ibn Rabia) killed by my hand. Moreover, I killed and captured many more of the strong men of the Quraysh. Many more than any of the other fighters were killed or captured on that day. However, my cousin Ubayda ibn Harith was martyred on that day.’Then Ali (MGB) turned towards his companions and asked, ‘Was it not so?’ They replied, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! Yes, it was so.’Then, the Commander of the Faithful (MGB) said, ‘O Jewish brother! And about the fourth occasion I should say that all the people of Mecca set out to attack us. They even used all the Arab and Quraysh tribes under their influence in this attack in order to avenge for their losses in the Battle of Badr. Gabriel descended upon the Prophet (MGB) and informed him aboutthis issue. The Prophet (MGB) set out and set up his army in the valley that is in front of the mountain of Uhud. The polytheists carried out a surprise attack against us. Many Muslims were martyred and the rest fled. I remained with the Prophet (MGB) while the Emigrants (Muhajerin) and their Helpers (Ansar) returned to their homes in Medina. They all said that the Prophet (MGB) and all his companions were killed. Then the Honorable the Exalted God did not let the polytheists to success. I suffered from more than seventy injuries several of which can be seen.’ Then he pushed his cloak aside, touched his injuries and said, ‘What I did on that day is to be rewarded by the Honorable the Exalted God - if He wills.’Then Ali (MGB) turned towards his companions and asked, ‘Was it not so?’ They replied, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! Yes, it was so.’Then the Commander of the Faithful (MGB) said, ‘O Jewish brother! And about the fifth occasion I should say that the people of the Quraysh tribe and the Arabs gathered together and a covenant was established between them not to stop fighting us until they kill the Prophet (MGB) and all the Muslims of the household of Abdul Mutalib.Then they came with all their weapons and armaments and laid siege to Medina. They were sure they would win. Gabriel descended to the Prophet (MGB) and informed him (MGB). The Prophet (MGB) dug a trench around himself and those of the Emigrants (Muhajerin) and their Helpers (Ansar) who were with us. The Quraysh tribe moved forward, and settled down around the trench and surrounded us. They considered themselves to be strong and considered us to be weak. Thus, they were roaming all around. The Prophet (MGB) invited them to the Honorable the Exalted God’s religion and beseeched their ties of kinship, but they did not listen and refused his invitation. The Prophet’s invitation of them to Islam made them more vicious. On that day the strong man of the Arabs was Amr ibn ‘Abd Wudd who kept yelling like a drunk camel and challenging someone to fight with him. He showed off his spears and sword but no one dared go fight him. God’s Prophet (MGB) had me stand up, wrapped his turban around my head, and handed me this sword.’ (At this time Ali (MGB) touched his sword). ‘Then I set out to fight with him. All the women in Medina were crying since they were worried about me getting killed in fighting with Amr ibn ‘Abd Wudd. However, the Honorable the Exalted God had him killed by my hands. The Arabs who considered no one but him to be a strong man hit me on the head with this blow!’ (And Ali (MGB) pointed to his head). ‘God had all the Arabs and the Quraysh run away due to the blow delivered to me.’Then, Ali (MGB) turned towards his companions and asked, ‘Was it not so?’ They replied, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! Yes, it was so.’Then, the Commander of the Faithful (MGB) said, ‘O Jewish brother! And about the sixth occasion I should say that I accompanied God’s Prophet (MGB) in an attack against your brethren in the oasis of Khaybar and other strong men from the Quraysh tribe. There appeared a lot of men on horses and on foot with perfect armaments against us just like a mountain. They possessed strong forts and were superior to us both in terms of military power and their number. Each one of them attacked us and challenged someone to go fight him. All my companions who went to fight with them were killed. Gradually the war became heated; the eyes became like bowls filled up with blood and everyone thought for himself. Some of my companions looked at others and said, ‘O Abal-Hassan! O Abal-Hassan! Move!’ Then God’s Prophet (MGB) dispatched me to the front of their fort. I killed everyone who came out. I tore up all the strong men who showed up to demonstrate their physical strength. I attacked them just like a lion. Then they hid in the fort. I broke down the gate of the fort and entered the fort by myself. I killed every man who showed up, and captured every woman until I conquered the fort. There was no one but God there to assist me.’ Then Ali (MGB) turned towards his companions and asked, ‘Was it not so?’ They replied, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! Yes, it was so.’Then the Commander of the Faithful (MGB) said, ‘O Jewish brother! And about the seventh occasion I should say that when God’s Prophet (MGB) decided to conquer Mecca, he (MGB) did not wish to leave any excuses for them. Therefore, he (MGB) wrote them a letter in which he (MGB) invited them towards God just as he (MGB) had done on the very first day. The Prophet (MGB) admonished them and frightened them about God’s torture. He (MGB) gave them the glad tiding of becoming forgiven and assured them of having hope for God’s forgiveness. He (MGB) wrote the Blessed Quranic Chapter of Bara’at (Declaration of Immunity) for them to be read for them at the end of the letter. He (MGB) suggested to his Companions to take the letter. Everybody refrained from doing so until someone accepted. The Prophet (MGB) sent the letter with him. Then Gabriel descended and said, ‘O Muhammad! Either you or one of the members of your household should deliver this letter.’ Then God’s Prophet (MGB) had me deliver the letter. Therefore, I went to Mecca. You all know the people of Mecca well. Each one of them was willing to spend all his wealth, family and life to tear me up into pieces and place each part of me on top of a different mountain. I delivered the letter of the Prophet (MGB)to them and read it for them. Everybody answered me by threatening me and giving me up in the air promises. All the men and the women were suspicious of me and expressed their hatred and animosity. However, I persisted as you all well know.’ Then Ali (MGB) turned towards his companions and asked, ‘Was it not so?’ They replied, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! Yes, it was so.’Then the Commander of the Faithful Ali (MGB) said, ‘O Jewish brother! These were the seven occasions on which the Honorable the Exalted God tested me during the lifetime of His Prophet (MGB) and found me obedient on every occasion due to the honor which He had granted me. No one else is like me in this respect. I could praise myself for this but the Honorable the Exalted God has admonished the people against this.’Then the Jew said, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! You are right! I swear by God that the Honorable the Exalted God has made you superior because you are a relative of the Prophet (MGB). God has made you prosperous because of being his brother and has credited you a position in relation to him just like that of Aaron to Moses (MGB). He has also honored you by examining you on these horrifying occasions which you mentioned on which you superseded all the other Muslims. None of the Muslims was like you on these frightening occasions in which you have participated, and you were the most virtuous one in those frightening occasions in which you participated. None of the Muslims is like you. Anyone who has seen you with the Prophet (MGB) during his lifetime or has looked at you after the death of the Prophet (MGB) has this same belief. O Commander of the Faithful! Now please tell me how you were tested after the demise of God’s Prophet and how you were patient and persevered. We more or less know the answer and can report it, but want to hear it from yourself as we heard those related to the lifetime of the Prophet (MGB).’ Then the Commander of the Faithful Ali (MGB) said, ‘O Jewish brother! Indeed God tested me on seven occasions after the demise of His Prophet (MGB) and found me obedient and persevering on every occasion due to the honor which He had granted me.O Jewish brother! About the first occasion I should say that in this world I had no one to associate with, be friends with, trust, rely upon or make any pledges with amongst the Muslims, but the Prophet (MGB). The Prophet (MGB) was my only shelter. He fostered me since my childhood and supported me in my adulthood. He (MGB) did not let me grow up like an orphan. He (MGB) alleviated my worries; made me needless of working to seek my share of daily bread; prevented me from engaging in business byproviding for my family and me. These were only his worldly aids to me. However, my spiritual gains and benefits from him through which I attained high ranks near the Honorable the Exalted God are much greater than this. When the Prophet (MGB) died I became so sad that I do not suppose all the mountains could withstand. All the members of my household became very impatient. They had lost their control. They could not tolerate this heavy burden of grief because it had made them impatient and put them out of their minds. They neither understood anything nor demanded anything. They could neither hear or speak. Other people were all influenced by this horrible situation. Some expressed condolences and sympathized with us, while others were impatient and mourned for us. I was the only one who did not lose my patience. I controlled myself and carried out the orders of the Prophet (MGB). I lifted his body; performed the ritual ablutions (wuzu) for the dead; performed the embalmment; shrouded the corpse; performed the prayer for the deceased; placed his body in the grave; and compiled the Quran and God’s decrees regarding the people. A lot of weeping, heart-aching mourning and the greatness of the calamity could not prevent me from performing my duty. I fulfilled my duties towards the Honorable the Exalted God and the Prophet (MGB) and completely performed whatever he (MGB) had ordered me to do. I was patient and I persevered.’Then Ali (MGB) turned towards his companions and asked, ‘Was it not so?’ They replied, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! Yes, it was so.’Then the Commander of the Faithful (MGB) said, ‘O Jewish brother! And about the second occasion I should say that God’s Prophet (MGB) established me as his Trustee during his lifetime. He (MGB) had all the people who were present pledge allegiance to me so that they would listen to and obey my orders. He (MGB) instructed all who were present there to declare this to all who were absent. It was always me who informed all others of his commands while I was with the Prophet (MGB). It was always me who was the head of those who accompanied me when we traveled. I never considered anyone to be more deserving than me for anything during the lifetime of the Prophet (MGB) and after his demise.When God’s Prophet (MGB) became ill which finally resulted in his demise, he (MGB) ordered that an army be dispatched out of Medina under the command of Usamah ibn Zayd. He (MGB) dispatched anyone from the Quraysh; Aws and Khazraj etc. whom he thought might break their pledge of allegiance to me; anyone who might be hostile with me since I had killed their father, son, brother or a relative of theirs; the Emigrants (Muhajerin)and the Helpers (Ansar) and anyone with a weak belief along with Usamah Ibn Zayd. The Prophet (MGB) only kept a small group of sincere believers with him so that no one may say something out of hatred to me or hinder me from the Caliphate after the demise of the Prophet (MGB).The last thing which the Prophet (MGB) said regarding the management of his nation’s affairs was that the army of Usamah should be dispatched to war and no one under his command should disobey his orders. He (MGB) stressed this. However, once the Prophet (MGB) passed away, the very same men under whom the Prophet (MGB) had dispatched with Usamah left their posts; abandoned him; opposed the orders given by God’s Prophet (MGB); and ignored all the recommendations of the Prophet (MGB) about accompanying and helping Usamah’s army. They abandoned him and retreated to Medina to break their pledge of allegiance to me which they had made with the Prophet (MGB); break their pledge with the Honorable the Exalted God and the Prophet (MGB); and yell out in order to choose a leader for themselves without the participation or involvement of any of the members of the household of Abdul Mutalib. Their main goal was to break their pledge of allegiance which they had made to me. They were doing this while I was busy with the burial rites and rituals for the Prophet of God (MGB) and could not do anything else since attending to the Prophet’s corpse was more important than anything else. O Jewish brother! This act of the people abandoning me at this hard time burnt my heart the most. I was patient although I was mourning and had suffered from the great calamity of the loss of God’s Prophet (MGB) who was the only one I could trust besides God. I persevered on this occasion which happened immediately after the previous one.’Then Ali (MGB) turned towards his companions and asked, ‘Was it not so?’ They replied, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! Yes, it was so.’Then the Commander of the Faithful (MGB) said, ‘O Jewish brother! And about the third occasion I should say that the one who sat in the Prophet’s (MGB) place was a fair man who came to see me everyday and apologized saying that he was ashamed that he had broken his allegiance to me, and had usurped my right. He respected me and asked for forgiveness. Based on this, I thought to myself that my God-given rights would be returned to me after him in a pleasant way. I thought that I should not wage a war in the new Islamic society that is still suffering from the remains of the ignorance of the past. I thought I should not argue so as to have some side with me and others oppose me, since then the quarrel may turn into a battle. A group of the special companions of the Prophet whom I knew well andare sincere believers in God, the Quran and the religion associated with me, invited me to claim my right in public and private. They were ready to sacrifice their lives so as to help me and honor their pledge of allegiance to me. I advised them to be calm and patient and that God may give back my due rights without any fighting or blood-shed. Many people started to doubt the religion after the demise of the Prophet (MGB), and many worthless greedy individuals were after the power to rule as the Caliph. Each tribe vociferously announced that the Caliph should be someone chosen from amongst them. What they all implied was that the affairs of the state must be in the hands of someone other than me.When the first Caliph (who is Abu Bakr) was about to die, he entrusted the affairs to his friend to be in charge after him. This was another hardship that pursued the previous one and usurped my God-given right to the position of Caliphate for the second time. Again some of the companions of the Prophet which are either dead or alive now gathered around me and repeated their concerns about my Caliphate. Again I invited them to patience and calmness so that the Islamic society may be protected, and the society which the Prophet (MGB) had formed with a lot of hardship not become disunited. The Prophet (MGB) had established the Islamic society with a genuine policy. He (MGB) had been easy-going at some times, and stern at other times. He (MGB) forgave sometimes and unsheathed his sword at other times. The Prophet (MGB) was very sympathetic with the people. He (MGB) fed them and pleased them just as soon as they approached Islam and were about to run away from it. He gave them clothing, carpets and beds even though we ourselves as the members of the household lived in homes without roofs and doors. The walls of our homes were made of date palm branches and leaves. We neither had any carpets or any blankets. Several of us shared one dress and took turns to pray with it. We remained hungry around the clock. The Prophet (MGB) even gave away the one-fifth levy that was our God-ordained rightful share to others and assisted the wealthy and materialist Arabs with it. I had to maintain the society which had been formed with this much hardship and could not lead it into the verge of separation and dispute. If I uprose and invited the people to help me, they had only one of two choices. They would either obey me and fight the opponents on my behalf and get killed, or abandoned me and become unbelievers for committing the sin of disobeying me. They all knew that their position relative to me is like the position of the people of Moses as opponents of Aaron. They knew that they would suffer a similar catastrophe like that which the people of Moses suffered due to their disobedience of Aaron. I thought that just being sorry and patient would increase my reward near the Honorable God until God ordains what He wills ‘…And the command of Allah is a decree determined.’ This would also be easier for the Islamic society which I described for you.O Jewish brother! It would have been right for me not to have paid attention to these points and demanded my rights. All the companions of the Prophet (MGB) including those who have now passed away and those who are present here acknowledge that my power is more than others; my tribe is nobler than all the other tribes; my followers are loftier and more obedient than others; the motivation of my followers to support me is higher and their nobilities and background are more outstanding as others as me myself have a good background of association with the Prophet (MGB), closeness to the Prophet (MGB), and I am the Trustee of the Prophet (MGB). Moreover, I deserve to be in charge of the position of the Caliphate due to the explicit will of the Prophet (MGB) and the pledge of allegiance which they had made to me. When the Prophet (MGB) passed away, the rule of the affairs was in the hands of his family - not their hands or that of their families. The members of the household of the Prophet (MGB) which had been purified by God deserved more to run the affairs of the state than others. They possessed all the necessary characteristics for the position of the Caliphate.’Then Ali (MGB) turned towards his companions and asked, ‘Was it not so?’ They replied, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! Yes, it was so.’ Then the Commander of the Faithful (MGB) said, ‘O Jewish brother! And about the fourth occasion I should say that the one was put in charge after Abu Bakr consulted with me from the beginning to the end of everything he wanted to do and issued all decrees according to my opinion. He always sought my opinion regarding tough issues and acted accordingly. My companions and I do not know of anyone else whose counsel he seeks. No one but me was eager to become the Caliph after him. When he was attacked and about to die without any previous illnesses, I had no doubts that I was going to regain my right of Caliphate without any problems; that the future would be as I wished it to be; and that God would bring about a good future. However, he named six persons as candidates for the position of the Caliphate at the end, and I was named as the last one. He did not even consider me to be equal to them. He did not remember the fact that I was the Prophet’s relative and Trustee. He did not even remember that I was the Prophet’s groom. None of the candidates had the brilliant background and good service to Islam as I had. He let us consult amongst ourselves and chose one as the future Caliph with the majority vote. He ordered his son to cut off our necks if we disobeyed him or failed to choose one from amongst ourselves as the future Caliph.O Jewish brother! This was bitter enough for me! This group of candidates tried as hard as they could to deliver lectures and lobby on their own behalfwhile they could. I remained silent until they asked my opinion. I then presented my background and explained to them what they clearly knew. I proved my rightfulness and their unrightfulness for them. I reminded them of the Prophet’s will and their pledge of allegiance to me. However, their love for getting into office; ordering the people around; their attachment to this world; and following in the footsteps of the previous Caliphs led them to demand an undue right for themselves. Whenever I had a chance to be alone with any of them I reminded them of the Reckoning on the Resurrection Day, and frightened them of the result of their unjust demand. They would agree with me on the condition that I turn the Caliphate position over to them after myself. They knew well that I could not do so and act against the Quran and the decree of the Prophet (MGB), and turn over to them what God had withheld from them. Then one of the radical persons in the council made a radical move, took the affairs out of my hands, and turned the position of the Caliphate over to Uthman, although he never matched any of the members of the council since he was a wealthy and materialist person. He never paid any attention to the people’s noble character and religious beliefs. He ignored all spiritual noble characteristics for which God had honored the Prophet (MGB) and his Holy Household. I do not even think that the very same members of the council who appointed Uthman to the position of the Caliphate became sorry for their choice before the night of that very same day, and started to blame one another. No long time passed before they who had empowered the dictator denounced and abandoned him. Uthman got worried. He went to his supporters and his other companions and asked that they accept his resignation. He expressed his sorrow and repentance. O Jewish brother! This was even a harder calamity than the previous ones! I hoped it had never happened. I was under so much pressure for this event that it cannot be described in words. However, I had no choice but to be patient! On the very same day of pledging allegiance to Uthman, the members of the council came to me and apologized for having opposed me. They asked me to revolt against Uthman and put him out of office. They all pledged allegiance to me and promised that they would sacrifice their lives to achieve this end. However, I put things off whenever they came by and had them attend to something else. For example, once I asked them to go shave their heads before we revolt. At another time I asked them to arrange for a private meeting in such and such place. This way I kept them busy and divulged their secrets.’O Jewish brother! I swear to God that the very same considerations which had prevented me from doing anything in the past were again obstacles whichhindered me. I realized that isolation and patience is a more appropriate approach for me. It was better for me to maintain my supporters who agree with me than to revolt and have them get killed, although they were all ready to sacrifice their lives. I was even more ready to die since as those who are absent and those who are present all know that to me death is just like a sip of cold water in the mouth on a very hot day. My uncle Hamzih, my brother Ja’far, my cousin Ubaydah and I have made a pledge to God and His Prophet (MGB) and will honor it. Some of my companions went so far as to sacrifice their lives in this way. I was held back due to God’s will. The Honorable the Exalted God revealed the following verse about us, ‘Among the Believers are men who have been true to their covenant with Allah. of them some have completed their vow (to the extreme), and some (still) wait: but they have never changed (their determination) in the least:’ I swear by God that I am the one referred to in this verse as the one who still waits.O Jewish brother! I have not abandoned my pledge! The reason why I was silent in front of Uthman and did not do anything is that he is going to be punished by his own baseness and untrustworthiness which I found in him and this would draw the people from near and afar to want to dismiss and kill him. I just stayed on the side and waited until this happened. I neither said ‘yes’ nor did I say ‘no.’Then the nation rushed to the door of my house. God knows that I hated the Caliphate, since I knew that the very same people who insist in making me the Caliph are used to collecting worldly goods and having fun. Although they well knew that I would be hard on them and not fulfill their greediness, they had gotten used to rushing in doing things and could not be soothed. They hurriedly chose me by insisting a lot but when they realized that they could not gain anything from me they started to oppose and criticize me.’Then Ali (MGB) turned towards his companions and asked, ‘Was it not so?’ They replied, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! Yes, it was so.’Then the Commander of the Faithful (MGB) said, ‘O Jewish brother! And about the fifth occasion I should say that when the ones who pledged allegiance to me realized that I would not fulfill their personal aims, they rebelled against me with the help of that woman (i.e. Ayesha). They placed her on the back of a camel and turned her around in the frightening deserts and wide valleys even though I was in charge of her as the Trustee of the Prophet (MGB). The dogs at Huab barked at her and she felt sorry Yet she followed a group of people who had pledged allegiance to me bothat the time of the Prophet (MGB) and later on, and continued opposing me until she entered upon the people of Basra whose hands were short, their beards were long, their intellectual capacity was low, and their thoughts were corrupt. These people were light-headed desert dwellers. This woman took control of these unwise people and they unsheathed their swords, threw their spears and arrows without any knowledge. I had two problems with them. If I did nothing in response to them, they would not follow the intellect and put their rebellion and corruption aside. If I fought with them, then there would be a lot of blood shedding which I never wanted. I was both apologetic to them and gave an ultimatum by threatening them. I suggested to that woman to go home. I also suggested to the group who had brought her to honor their pledge of allegiance to me and not to break their covenant with the Honorable the Exalted God.I offered them as much as I had the power to. I even talked to some of them . He returned. I talked with others in the same way but their ignorance, rebellion and deviation became even more than before. I fought with them since they insisted on that. I defeated them in the war and they became sorry. Many of them were killed on the battlefield. I fought them since I had no other choice. Had I postponed fighting, they would have done things which would have prevented me from forgiving them as I did after the war.If I had not blocked them I would have been disloyal to myself and the nation and would have become a partner in the sins which they had decided to commit as follows:1- They had planned to extend their rebellion in the surroundings of the Islamic country to whatever extent they could and do acts of corruption.2- They had planned to kill and shed the blood of the citizens.3- They had planned to subject the rules of Islam and the laws of justice according to the opinions of a low-minded and unintelligent women and follow the old Roman nation; Yemen and destroyed nations of the past in this respect. Had I hesitated to fight, I would have ultimately been forced to fight with them and would also be ashamed of the evil deeds and crimes which that woman and her troops would have committed. Still I did not start the battle without hesitation. First, I gave them an ultimatum and postponed the war as much as possible. I was calm. I negotiated with them several times. I even sent several mediators to them. I made them several offers which were to their benefit. However, they turned me down on every occasion. They made me helpless, forced me to start a war, and end the issue as God willed. Given all that was done before the war they had been given enough ultimatum.’Then Ali (MGB) turned towards his companions and asked, ‘Was it not so?’ They replied, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! Yes, it was so.’Then the Commander of the Faithful Ali (MGB) said, ‘O Jewish brother! And about the sixth occasion I should say that it was the arbitration council and the Battle with the son of the liver-eater Hind (Muaviayh). This man had been an enemy of God, His Prophet (MGB), and the believers from the day on which God appointed Muhammad (MGB) to Prophethood until the city of Mecca was conquered by the force of the Muslims’ swords.Muaviayh and his father Abu Sufyan had pledged allegiance to me on that very same day and on three other occasions. His father was the first person who greeted me using the title of ‘the Commander of the Faithful.’ He was the one who constantly encouraged me to fight for my due rights and renewed his pledge of allegiance to me every time he met me.The strangest of all is that when Muawiyah realized that the Blessed the Sublime God had returned my right to me and had strengthened my position, he lost all hopes of becoming the fourth Caliph and ruling in our government. He turned to the disobedient Amr al-As and was generous with him so that he accepted his invitation. Amr became his fan when Muawiyah entrusted the governorship of Egypt to him, although it is forbidden for him to use even one Dirham of the taxes collected from Egypt as it was so for Muawiyah to give him any more than his own share. Then he rebelled and acted oppressively in the Islamic country. He was kind to anyone who swore allegiance to him and fended away anyone who opposed him.He joined the perfidious party (Nakiseen) in an attack against Islamic territories and looted the east, the west, the north and the south. I received the news and the reports of their deeds until the one-eyed Saqafy (Al-Muqayrih) proposed that I make peace with Muawiyah and appoint him to the governorship of the territories that were under his control. This opinion was a good one in terms of politics, but I could not bring any excuses for doing this in God’s presence and could not take responsibility for Muawiyah’s acts of oppression. I thought about this proposal and consulted with reliable people who were God-fearing and followed the Prophet (MGB). They had the same opinion as I did regarding the son of the liver-eater lady. May God not bring the day on which I use any of the oppressors as my aids.I once dispatched Jarir al-Bajaly and dispatched Abu Musa al-Ash’ari to him on another occasion. They both followed their worldly desires, theirtemptations, pleased him and were disloyal to me. I realized that they were not act according to God’s command and they were becoming more and more deviated and corrupt as time passed. I consulted with a group of the chosen companions of the Prophet from the Badriyeen who were honored by God and had participated in the pledge of allegiance at Rezvan and other noble Muslims. They unanimously agreed that we go to war with him and not let him take charge of the affairs of the Muslims.My companions and I set out to fight with him. We wrote him letters from every way-station. I sent him many representatives and invited him to put aside his corruption and join me and the other Muslims. He answered me with haughty letters; wished unsuitable wishes; and set conditions which were not acceptable by God, the Prophet and the Muslims.In one of his letters he made it a condition that we should surrender a group of the Prophet’s best companions to him including Ammar Yasir so that he could hang them in retaliation for the blood of Uthman. Where can you find someone like Ammar? I swear by God that he was always the sixth person present whenever five of us gathered around the Prophet (MGB). He was also the fourth person present whenever four of us gathered around the Prophet (MGB).He wanted to retaliate for the blood of Uthman even though he, his colleagues and his damned family who were branches of the Cursed Tree as mentioned in the Holy Quran made the people rebel against Uthman and caused him to be killed. He attacked me since I did not accept his unreasonable conditions and he was proud of his rebellion. He gathered a group of the Homayr tribes who had neither any intellect nor any insight in religion around himself and led them astray so as to follow him. He fooled them with worldly possessions and attracted them to himself.We set the Honorable the Exalted God as the judge and set out to fight him in order to stop him. We fought with him after giving him an ultimatum, so that he may have no excuses left. God made us victorious over His enemies and ours as usual.We were holding the flag of God’s Prophet (MGB) under which God had always killed the followers of Satan, but Muawiyah was holding the flag of his father under which his father had fought with God’s Prophet (MGB).He was about to die with no way out. He rode his horse, saw that his flag had fallen down and felt hopeless. He sought the help of Amr al-As. Amr al-As advised him to bring out many copies of the Quran, place them on top of their spears and to ask for the arbitration of the Quran. He told Muawiyah that since the son of Abu Talib, his followers and the rest of theHousehold of the Prophet (MGB) are religious and had invited you to arbitration of the Quran in the beginning, they would accept its arbitration from you at the end.Muawiyah accepted the idea proposed by Amr al-As since he was helpless and had no way out of war and getting killed. He placed many copies of the Quran on the spears and had them held up thinking that he was inviting the people to abide by the Quran. I had lost many of my good friends and sincere companions. The rest of the people were inclined to accept the Quran’s arbitration and stop the war. They thought that since the son of the liver-eater Hind (Muawiyah) is adhering to the rules of the Quran, he would honor them. They welcomed his call and all accepted his suggestion.I announced to them that this was a deception which Muawiyah had plotted using Amr al-As and that they would not adhere to it. However, they did not believe me and did not obey my orders. They insisted on accepting his suggestion. Whether I liked it or not, things became so bad that some of them said that we should kill Ali just like Uthman or turn him and his family over to Muawiyah if he doesn’t accept Muawiyah’s suggestion.God knows best that I did my best and tried as hard as I could to convince them to follow me, but they would not obey me. I even asked them to give me a little time - as much as milking a camel or running a horse so that I may complete the work. However, they did not accept it except for this man (while Ali (MGB) was pointing to Malik al-Ashtar), his followers, and a group of my own household. I swear by God that what hindered me from following my own idea was my fear of these two being killed (while Ali (MGB) was pointing to Al-Hassan (MGB) and Al-Hussein (MGB) with his hand), and the cessation of the lineage of God’s Prophet (MGB). It was also due to my fear of these two being killed (while Ali (MGB) was pointing to Abdullah ibn Ja’far and Muhammad ibn Hanifeh - may God be pleased with them - with his hand), since I knew that they were only endangered because of me. Therefore, I was forced to accept God’s destiny and accept the demands of the people. Once the battle was stopped and the swords were no long pointed at them, they demanded that they themselves be the arbiters instead of the Quran. They took over the rules of the Quran and put its decrees aside. I never considered anyone to be able to arbitrate on behalf of God’s religion since man’s arbitration in God’s religion is undoubtedly wrong. However, the people did not accept anything but arbitration.I wanted to have a knowledgeable person from my household or some of the other tribes who was wise, reliable and religious to arbitrate on my behalf. The son of Hind disagreed with whomever I named. He did not accept anyof my rightful proposals. He oppressed us through my own companions. When they insisted and wanted to force me to accept the arbitration, I sought refuge in the Honorable the Exalted God and left this up to themselves. Then they chose a man who was deceived by Amr As, and the world got filled with the shame of this act. They themselves became sorry about it.’ Then Ali (MGB) turned towards his companions and asked, ‘Was it not so?’ They replied, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! Yes, it was so.’Then the Commander of the Faithful (MGB) said, ‘O Jewish brother! And about the seventh I should tell you that in his will to me, God’s Prophet (MGB) had informed me that I would fight with a tribe of my own companions near the end of my life, although they fast during the days, worship God at night and read the Quran but have put aside the religion by arguing and fighting with me just like an arrow which flies from a bow. Zul-Sadiyyeh is going to be amongst them. I will have a prosperous end after killing them. When I returned after the arbitration, some of the people started to blame each other as to why the Battle of Siffin ended by arbitration.They found themselves no solution but to except to criticize the leader and said, ‘Our leader should not have obeyed our wrong opinion. Since he was certain about our fault, he must kill either himself or those who were faulty. Since he obeyed us, he has become an unbeliever. Therefore, it is lawful for us to kill him and shed his blood now.’ They united concerning this issue, left my army rapidly and yelled ‘There is no arbiter but God!’Then they divided up. One group of them stayed in Nakhileh while a second group went to Hurura. Yet a third group of them went to the east beyond the Dijla river. They tired every Muslim they ran into by forcing him to deny me. If he argued with them, they would let him go. Otherwise they killed him. I went to see the first and the second groups and invited them to obey the Honorable the Exalted God, accept the truth and to return towards God. They did not accept anything but fighting with swords and they were not content with anything else. Since I found no other solution, I surrendered the first two groups to God’s decree. Therefore, I killed them. O Jewish Brother! I am so sorry about them. Had they not chosen this destructive route they would have not been killed. Then imagine how strong a castle could have been formed for Islam. However, God willed no other end but this unpleasant one for them. Then I wrote a letter to the third group and sent several delegates. The delegates were chosen ones. They were all God-fearing and ascetic. However, it was of no use. They did nothing but follow what the other two groups did. They hurriedlykilled the Muslims who did not agree with them and continuously killed good people. I attacked them myself and blocked off the Euphrates river from their access. Again I sent trustworthy delegates and advisors to them and made all attempts to accept their apologies by means of those men (while Ali (MGB) was pointing at Malik Ashtar; Al-Ahnaf ibn Qays; Sa’id ibn Qays al-Arhabi; and Al-Ash’as ibn Qays al-Kindi). O Jewish Brother! Since they accepted no solution except fighting, I fought with them until all of them were killed. O Jewish brother! They were all killed - all being more than forty-thousand of them. Not even one of them could flee. Then I pulled out the man who had breasts just like women have from amongst the dead corpses in front of these very same men that you see. He had breasts just like women do. Then Ali (MGB) turned towards his companions and asked, ‘Was it not so?’ They replied, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! Yes, it was so.’Then the Commander of the Faithful (MGB) said, ‘O Jewish brother! And about the seventh. I was faithful to all seven and just one rank remains which is undoubtedly near.’ Then the companions of Ali (MGB) cried.

Tell us another one!’ Then the Commander of the Faithful (MGB) said, ‘And the last is that this (while referring to his head) shall become filled with the blood of this (while he was pointing to his crown)’. All of a sudden all the people in the Jamea Mosque started to cry and mourned so loudly that the people from all the houses in Kufa left their homes crying. Then the head of the Jews accepted Islam right then by the hand of the Commander of the Faithful (MGB) and lived in Medina until the Commander of the Faithful (MGB) was murdered by Ibn Muljam’s sword - may God damn Ibn Muljam.When the head of the Jews heard the news, he went to Ali’s (MGB) house and stood in front of Al-Hassan (MGB), while the people had gathered around him (MGB). They brought Ibn Muljam with his hands tied there. The head of the Jews said, ‘O Abu Muhammad! Kill him! May God kill him. I have seen in the books which were revealed to Moses (MGB) that in the sight of the Honorable the Exalted God this crime is much greater than the crime committed by Adam’s son when he killed his brother, and the crime of those who treated the she-camel of Thamud clan wrongfully.’"

Razeqi who was the gate-keeper for Al-Mutevakil looked at me and ordered that I be taken to his presence. Once I entered, he asked me, ‘O Seqr! What do you want?’ I said, ‘Sir. It is good!’ He said, ‘Be seated!’ I told myself that I had made a mistake and was going to be captured, too. Once the others present left and when he found some time he looked at me and said, ‘How are you doing? What do you want here?’ I said, ‘I have come for a good deed.’ Hesaid, ‘Perhaps you have come to ask about the news of your master?’ Then I said, ‘Who is my master? My master the Commander of the Faithful (Referring to Al-Mutevakil.)’ Then he said, ‘Be quiet! Your master is the one who is rightful! Do not be afraid of me. I follow the same beliefs as you do.’ Then I said, ‘Thanks God!’ He said, ‘Do you wish to see him?’ He said, ‘Then be seated until the postman leaves him.’ Then I sat down and waited until the postman left him. Then he told his servant, ‘Take Seqr’s hand and guide him to the room in which that Alavite is imprisoned and leave them alone.’ The servant took me to the jail and showed me the room. When I entered the room, I saw that the Imam (MGB) was sitting on a piece of straw mat with a dug up grave in front of him. I greeted and the Imam (MGB) responded and asked me to sit down. I sat down. The Imam (MGB) said, ‘O Seqr! Why have you come here?’ I said, ‘O my Master! I have come here to get some news about you.’ I looked at the grave and cried. The Imam (MGB) looked at me and said, ‘O Seqr! Do not worry! They cannot mistreat me now.’ I said, ‘Praise be to God!’ Then I added, ‘There is a narration on the authority of the Prophet (MGB), the meaning of which I cannot understand.’ The Imam (MGB) asked, ‘Which one?’ I said, ‘The one in which he (MGB) said, ‘Do not be enemies with the days so that they do not be your enemies.’ The Imam (MGB) said, ‘We are the days and we shall be for as long as the heavens and the Earth are there! Sunday refers to the Commander of the Faithful Imam Ali (MGB). Monday refers to Al-Hassan (MGB) and Al-Hussein (MGB). Tuesday refers to Ali ibn al-Hussein as-Sajjad (MGB), Muhammad ibn Ali al-Baqir (MGB) and Ja’far ibn Muhammad as-Sadiq (MGB). Wednesday refers to Musa ibn Ja’far al-Kadhim (MGB), Ali ibn Musa al-Ridha (MGB), Muhammad ibn Ali al-Jawad (MGB), and I. Thursday refers to my son Al-Hassan ibn Ali (MGB) and Friday refers to my grandson who shall gather all the followers of the truth together as a single party and fill the Earth with justice after it has become full of oppression. This is what ‘days’ refers to. Do not be our enemies so that we may not be your enemies in the Hereafter!’The he (MGB) said, ‘Say goodbye and leave. You are not secure here.’”The compiler of the book - may God be pleased with him - said, “The days of the week are not really the same as the Divine Leaders. Here the Prophet (MGB) has used it as a symbolic reference to the Divine Leaders just as the Imam (MGB) said so that those who are not on the right path do not understand it. This is similar to the use of ‘By the Fig and the Olive, And the Mount of Sinai, And this City of security’ by the Honorable the Exalted God in reference to the Prophet (MGB), Ali (MGB), Al-Hassan (MGB) and Al-Hussein (MGB). This is similar to when the Honorable theExalted God used ‘sheep’ in reference to ‘women’ as supported by some interpreters in the story of David and the two who went to see him. This is also similar to the use of ‘travel through the Earth’ in the Quran. As-Sadiq (MGB) was asked about the following words of the Honorable the Exalted God, ‘Do they not travel through the Earth?’ He (MGB) replied, ‘What is meant is would you not delve into the meaning of the Quran as in the following verse the Honorable the Exalted God has used ‘a secret covenant’ to refer to having sex, ‘But do not make a secret contract with them’ or used ‘to eat’ to refer to having to go to the toilet in ‘They had both to eat their (daily) food’ when referring to Jesus (MGB) and his mother Mary (MGB) or used ‘the Bee’ in ‘And thy Lord taught the Bee’ to refer to the Prophet (MGB). There are many similar instances.”"

He should not have done anything else. The first occasion on which God and the Prophet ﷺ cursed Abu Sufyan was when the Prophet ﷺ was emigrating to Medina. Abu Sufyan cursed the Prophet, and wanted to hit the Prophet when he ran into the Prophet on his way back from Syria. However, God fended off his attack. The second occasion was on the day of the Battle of Badr in which he fled from the Badr well, and God and the Prophet cursed him. The third occasion was on the day of the Battle of Uhud when after the Battle Abu Sufyan shouted, ‘Show your superiority, Hubal’ and the Prophet of God replied, ‘God is the Most High and the Most Glorious.’ Then Abu Sufyan said, ‘We have Uzza and you do not.’ Then the Prophet ﷺ replied, ‘God is our friend but you have no friends. ’The fourth occasion was on the day of the Battle of the Trench when Abu Sufyan had come to fight the Muslims accompanied by all of the Quraysh tribe. However, the Honorable the Exalted God had them return angry and defeated. They had no gains from this Battle and the Honorable the Exalted God revealed two verses to the Prophet from the Holy Quran in the Al-Ahzab Chapter. Abu Sufyan and his companions were called atheists, and Muawiya was called a polytheist and an enemy of God. The fifth occasion was on the day of the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah in which the Quraysh intercepted the Muslims who wanted to offer animals for sacrifice and did not let them reach the place of offering. They also did not let the Prophet ﷺ reach the Holy House. Thus, they had to abandon their sacrificial animals, and the Prophet ﷺ had to return without having performed the circumambulations of the Ka’ba. Then the Honorable the Exalted God and the Prophet ﷺ cursed Abu Sufyan. The sixth occasion was on the day of the Battle of Confederates (Ahzab/Khandaq) when Abu Sufyan leading the Quraysh, Amer ibn al-Tufayl leading the Hawazin and 'Uyaina ibn Hisn leading the invaded Medina with the Ghatafan assisted by the Jewish Qurayzah and Nadir tribes, and attacked Medina. The Prophet ﷺ cursed their leaders and their followers and said, ‘If there are any believers amongst those who follow them, they shall not be cursed. However, there are no believers or noble ones amongst the leaders of this group and there are none to be saved.’ The seventh occasion was on the day on which they plotted and attacked the Prophet ﷺ in a group of twelve people from the Umayyads headed by Abu Sufyan and five other ones. Thus, the Prophet ﷺ cursed them. Moreover, the camel, its leader, and its rider also cursed them.’ The complier of this book said, “This narration has been cited as above. However, there were fourteen people who attacked the Prophet ﷺ.”"

This was done so that the people realize that there are two kinds of rewards and punishments from the Sublime God: One in an especial way as a grant and the second way due to worthiness and servitude. This was done so that the people never belittle the poor or the ill. This was done so that the people realize that God would make ill anyone whom He wills and treats anyone whom He wills by any means which He wills. This was done so that it may serve as a lesson to learn from for some people; as a means of destitute and hardship for some other people; and as a means of prosperity for some other people. He is Just in all of his Judgements and Wise in all of his Deeds. He would not do anything to any of His servants unless it was the best thing for them. There is no power save in Him.”"

You should know that you will go to Paradise, if you do not commit any major sins.’ I asked, ‘What are the major sins?’ The Imam (MGB) said, ‘The greater of the major sins are associating others as partners with the Honorable the Exalted God; emigration from an Islamic environment; damnation of parents; accusing pious women of fornication; fleeing from a holy war; oppressively devouring the properties of an orphan; usury after having clear proof of its forbiddance ; and murdering a believer.’ I asked the Imam (MGB), ‘What about adultery and stealing?’ The Imam (MGB) replied, ‘They are not like the above.’”The compiler of the book - may God be pleased with him - said, “The various narrations in this book which differ in the quantity of major sins are not really that different from each other, although some state that there are five major sins, while others have stated that there are seven, eight and even more major sins. However, these are not different from each other since after the sin of associating partners with God which is the greatest major sin, the other sins are somewhat greater than the following ones, and every other major sin is less than the sin of associating a partner with God.”"

He should be humble when he meets someone who is better and more pious than himself, until he attains his rank. When he meets someone who is more wicked than himself, he should say that person is a good person so as to end up wickedness. Should he behave this way, he will become honorable and will be the master of his own time.”"

However, if one is stuck in water or mud and is worried that his prayer may get too late, he can say his prayers in water and mud and just point with his head instead of bowing down and bend it down more instead of prostration. It doesn’t matter if one says his prayers on the side of the road, but he should not do so where there is traffic. One should not say his prayers in the bath. However, he can say it in the dressing room. One should never say his prayers on the ants’ nest, since then the ants will interfere with his prayer. One should not say his prayers in the camel way-station, unless he is worried that thieves might steal his belongings that are being carried by the camels. It is okay to pray in the sheep stable. One should never pray where the water may flow, since then he might get drowned. The restriction of praying in the salty land applies only to the Prophet and the Divine Leaders. If a normal person clears the place where he wants to prostrate by seriously banging on it so that there is a clean place to put his forehead on, then he can pray there. One should not pray in places like Zajnan which is located near Mecca and other similar locations, since there are snakes and other evils there.”"

Someone wanted to ask about a decree, another one had a complaint, and was expressing his conditions. Suddenly a man came to him and said, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! Peace be upon you as well as God’s Mercy and His Blessings.’ Then the Commander of the Faithful (MGB) looked at him with his two big eyes and replied, ‘And peace be upon you as well as God’s Mercy and His Blessings. Who are you?’ The man said, ‘A man and I are from your people, and I am a resident of one of your towns.’The Commander of the Faithful (MGB) said, ‘You are not one of my people and are not a resident of one of our towns. I would not have forgotten it, even if you had greeted me once.’Then the man said, “O Commander of the Faithful! Please grant me immunity.’ Then the Commander of the Faithful (MGB) asked, ‘Have you committed a crime in my town since you came here?’The man replied, ‘No.’ The Commander of the Faithful (MGB) asked him, ‘Then are you a soldier?’ The man replied, ‘Yes.’ Then the Commander of the Faithful (MGB) said, ‘Now that there is a peace treaty in effect, it doesn’t matter.’The man said, ‘I am one of the agents of Muawiyah. I was sent here in a disguise in order to ask you questions which Ibn al-Asfar (who is the Emperor of Rome) asked Muawiyah. The Emperor replied that if Muawiyah is the real ruler and the Caliph after Muhammad (MGB), he should be able to answer these questions. Then the Emperor would pledge allegiance to Muawiyah and pay him remuneration. Since Muawiyah could not answer thequestions he has dispatched me to ask them from you.’ Then the Commander of the Faithful Ali (MGB) said, ‘May God kill the offspring of the liver-eater Hind. How deviated and blind he and his companions are! I swear by God that he freed his female slave and did not understand how to join her in marriage. God will rule between me and this nation. They cut off my bonds of relationship; wasted my time; usurped my rights; belittled my grand position and united against me. O Qanbar! Bring Al-Hassan (MGB), Al-Hussein (MGB) and Muhammad (MGB) to me.’ The sons came by him. Then the Commander of the Faithful (MGB) said, ‘O Syrian man! These two are the (grand)sons of God’s Prophet (MGB) and this one is my own son. Ask your questions from any of them as you wish.’ The Syrian man said, ‘I will ask my questions from the long-haired one that is Al-Hassan (MGB) who is young. Then Al-Hassan (MGB) told him, ‘Ask me whatever you wish to ask.’Then the Syrian fellow asked, ‘What is the distance between right and wrong? How much is the distance between the heavens and the Earth? How much is the distance between the East and the West? What is Qus and Qazah (the bow and the rainbow)? Where is the place in which the unbelievers’ souls reside? Where is the place in which the believers’ souls reside? What does Al-Mo’anas refer to? What are the ten things each of which is harder than the other?’ Then Al-Hassan ibn Ali (MGB) said, ‘The distance between right and wrong is just four fingers. Whatever you yourself see is right, but most of whatever you hear may be wrong.’ The Syrian fellow said, ‘You are right!’ Al-Hassan (MGB) said, ‘The distance between the heavens and the Earth is the supplication of the oppressed one and the closing of the eyes. Anyone who says anything else has lied.’ The Syrian fellow said, ‘O (grand)son of the Prophet! You are right!’ Al-Hassan (MGB) said, ‘The distance between the East and the West is just the duration of time needed for the rotation of the sun from where it rises to where it sets during one day.’ The Syrian man said, ‘You are right! Then what is Qus and Qazah (the bow and the rainbow)?’ Al-Hassan ibn Ali (MGB) said, ‘Shame on you! Do not say Qus and Qazah since Qazah is the name of Satan. It is Qus Allah and it is a sign of abundance and immunity of the people of the Earth from drowning. The place in which the unbelievers’ souls shall reside is called Barahut. And the place in which the believers’ souls shall reside is called Salma. And Al-Mo’anas refers to one whose gender cannot be recognized. Once he or she grows up, it is a male if he ejaculates and it would be a female if she menstruates and the nipples grow. If its gender is still not distinguishable with these two signs, it should be asked to urinate towards a wall. It would be a male, if the urinationis fast flowing and it reaches the wall, while it would be a female if the urination just flows out like that of a camel. The ten things each of which is harder than the other are as follows. The hardest thing which the Honorable the Exalted God has created is the stone. However, iron is even harder than stone since it cuts the stone. Fire is even harder than iron since it can melt the iron. Water is even harder than fire since it can extinguish it. Clouds are even harder than water since they move it around. Winds are even harder than clouds since they move the clouds around. Yet the angel who dispatches the winds is harder than the wind itself. And the angel of death is even harder than the angel which dispatches the winds since it can take away its life. And death is even harder than the angel of death, since it takes away the angel of death. Yet harder than all of these is the order of God - the Lord of the Two Worlds - which can take away death itself. Then the Syrian fellow said, ‘I bear witness that you are the (grand)son of God’s Prophet (MGB). You are right! And I bear witness that Ali more deserves to rule than Muawiyah.’Then the Syrian fellow wrote down these answers and went to Muawiyah with them. Muawiyah wrote these answers to (Ibn Al-Asfar) the Emperor of Rome. Then Ibn al-Safar wrote the following back to Muawiyah, ‘O Muawiyah! Why do you use other people’s sayings and answer me with other people’s responses? I swear by Jesus that these are not your answers. Rather they have come from the treasury of Prophethood and the seat of messengership. And I will not even give you one Dirham if you ask for it.’”"

Then the Earth became too proud and said, ‘Is there anything to overpower me?’ Then God created the mountains and established them on the back of the Earth to hold it down. Then the mountains became too proud and said, ‘Is there anything to overpower us?’ Then God created iron which cuts down the mountains and overpowers them. Then iron became too proud and said, ‘Is there anything to overpower me?’ Then God created the fire which melts iron. Then fire became ablaze, roared, became proud and said, ‘Is there anything to overpower me?’ Then, God created water whichextinguishes fire. Then water became too proud, flooded and said, ‘Is there anything to overpower me?’ Then God created the wind which moved the waves of water and overcame the powers within it. Then the wind became proud, turned into a storm, spread about and said, ‘Is there anything to overpower me?’ Then God created man who designed and made a house in which he was safe from the wind and other things. Then man rebelled and said, ‘Is there anything to overpower me?’ Then God created death for him which overpowered and belittled man. Then death became proud of itself. Then God - may His Majesty be Exalted - said, ‘Do not be proud of yourself, since I shall keep you between the residents of Hell and residents of Paradise and will never give you life. Thus, death was belittled and frightened.’”"

(919 A.D.) narrated that his father quoted Abi Ahmad Muhammad ibn Zyad al-Azodi, Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Abi Nasr al-Bazanty, on the authority of Aban ibn Uthman al-Ahmar, on the authority of Aban ibn Taqlib, on the authority of Abi Ja’far Muhammad ibn Ali al-Baqir (MGB) who said the following regarding the following verse from the Honorable the Exalted God, “Forbidden to you (for food) are: dead meat, blood, the flesh of swine, and that on which hath been invoked the name of other than God; that which hath been killed by strangling, or by a violent blow, or by a headlong fall, or by being gored to death; that which hath been (partly) eaten by a wild animal; unless ye are able to slaughter it (in due form); that which is sacrificed on stone (altars); (forbidden) also is the division (of meat) by raffling with arrows: that is impiety. This day have those who reject faith given up all hope of your religion: yet fear them not but fear Me. This day have I perfected your religion for you, completed My favor upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion. But if any is forced by hunger, with no inclination to transgression, God is indeed Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.”The Imam (MGB) replied, “What ‘dead meat, blood, the flesh of swine’ refer to here are well-known already. However, ‘that on which hath been invoked the name of other than God’ refers to what has been slaughtered as an offering for the idols. And ‘that which hath been killed by strangling, or by a violent blow, or by a headlong fall, or by being gored to death’ refers to the fact that the Magians did not eat the meat of animals whose head was cut off. Rather they killed it unlawfully and ate it. They choked cows and sheep and ate them when they died. Sometimes they placed a cloth in front of the animal’s eyes and threw it down from the roof and ate it when it died. At other times they made the ewes fight with each other with their horns, and ate the one that got killed. And ‘that which hath been (partly) eaten by a wild animal; unless ye are able to slaughter it (in due form);’ refers to the fact that sometimes they ate what has been attacked by wolves and lions. God forbade eating such things. And ‘that which is sacrificed on stone (altars);’ refers to what the people used to sacrifice in a fire-house. The Quraysh used to worship trees and rocks and slaughtered for them. Thus ‘(forbidden) also is the division (of meat) by raffling with arrows’ refers to the practice of the Quraysh who divided up a slaughtered camel’s corpse into twenty-eight shares, gathered around it, drew lots with ten arrows, and gave it to men. There were ten lottery arrows. Seven of them had shares and three of them had no shares. The seven that had shares had the names Fach; Tawam; Musbil; Nafis; Hilis; Raqib; Mu’alli. Fach had one share; Tawam had two shares. Musbil had three shares. Nafis had four shares. Hilis had five shares. Raqib had six shares. Mu’alli had seven shares. The last three arrows which did not have any shares were called Samih, Manih, and Waghd, had no share at all. Those who got the arrows which did not have any shares had to pay for the camel. This is considered to be gambling and the Honorable the Exalted God forbade it.”"

They told him, ‘You are in charge of the affairs after your Prophet (MGB). We have come here to ask you several questions. Should you give us the correct answers we will believe in you, accept your religion and follow you.’ Then Umar told them, ‘Ask whatever you wish to ask.’ They said, ‘Inform us about the locks of the seven heavens; the grave which carried its resident around; the one who admonished his own nation, but was neither of the genies nor of the men; the place on which the Sun shone only once and never again; the five creatures which were not created in the womb; of the one, the two, the three, the four, the five, the six, the seven, the eight, the nine, the ten, the eleven and the twelve.’ Umar looked down, opened his eyes and said, ‘You have asked Umar ibn al-Khat’tab things which he doesn’t know. However, the Prophet’s cousin will answer all your questions.’ Then he sent after Ali (MGB). When Ali (MGB) came there, he told him, ‘O Abal-Hassan! This group of Jews have asked me questions none of which I could answer. They have pledged to believe in the Prophet (MGB), if we give them the right answers.’Ali (MGB) told them, ‘O group of Jews! Present your questions.’ They related to him what they had asked Umar.He (MGB) asked them, ‘Do you have any other questions?’ They said, ‘No, O the father of Shabar and Shobayr! ’ Then Ali (MGB) told them, ‘The locks of the heavens are associating partners with God, and the keys to them are saying ‘There is no god but God.’ And the grave which carried its resident around was the large whale which moved around at sea when Jonah was in its stomach. The one who advised his people which was neither of the genies nor of men was the ant which spoke with Solomon - the son of David (MGB). And the place where the Sun shone only once andnever again was in the depth of the sea which the Honorable the Exalted God split up for the Children of Israel to pass (when they were escaping from Egypt and chased by Pharaoh) and where Pharaoh and his soldiers were drowned.The five creatures which were not created in the wombs were Adam; Eve; the cane of Moses; the she-camel of Salih; and Abraham’s ram. And the One is the Honorable the Exalted God for whom there are no partners. And the two are Adam and Eve. And the three are the angels Gabriel, Michael and Isra’fil . And the four are the Torah; the Bible; the Zabur (Psalms of David) and the Quran. And the five are the five prayers made obligatory upon the Prophet (MGB). And the six are the six days during which God created the heavens, the Earth and whatever lies in between as we read in what the Honorable the Exalted God says, ‘We created the heavens and the Earth and all between them in Six Days.’ And the seven refers to the seven firmaments which the Honorable the Exalted God says in the following verse, ‘And (have We not) built over you the seven firmaments.’ And the eight refers to the eight who bear the Throne as we read in what the Honorable the Exalted God says, ‘…and eight will, that Day, bear the Throne of thy Lord above them.’ And the nine refers to the miracles which were sent to Moses - the son of Imran. And the ten refers to the ten (more) days referred to in the following verse as said by the Honorable the Exalted God, ‘We appointed for Moses thirty nights, and completed (the period) with ten (more)...’ And the eleven refers to what Joseph told his father ‘I did see eleven stars’And the twelve refers to the twelve times Moses was advised to strike at the rock by the Honorable the Exalted God, ‘‘Strike the rock with thy staff.’ Then gushed forth there from twelve springs….’ The Jews faced Ali (MGB) And said, ‘We bear witness that there is no god but God; Muhammad is God’s Prophet and you are the Prophet’s cousin.’ Then they faced Umar and said, ‘We bear witness that this Ali (MGB) is the brother of God’s Prophet (MGB) and is more deserving for your rank than you are.’ Everyone who was with them sincerely accepted Islam.”"

I shall ask them, ‘What did you do with the Two Heavy Things after me?’ They will say, ‘We followed the greater one and acknowledged it, and supported with the smaller one and assisted it.’ I shall tell them, ‘May you return fed and happy.’ They will take a drink from the Pool and shall never again become thirsty. The face of their leader shall shine like the sun and the face of their companions shall be as the full moon on the night of the fourteenth night and as bright as the stars in the sky.’”Then Abuzar asked, ‘Don’t you bear witness to this?’ They said, ‘Yes, we do.’ Then he said, ‘I bear witness to that, too.’ Yahya and Ebad said, ‘Bear witness before the Honorable the Exalted God that Aba Abdul Rahman narrated this narration for us.’ Aba Abdul Rahman said, ‘Bear witness before the Honorable the Exalted God that Al-Harith ibn Hasira narrated this narration for me.’ Al-Harith said, ‘Bear witness before the Honorable the Exalted God that Sakhr ibn al-Hakam narrated this narration for me.’ Sakhr ibn al-Hakam said, ‘Bear witness before the Honorable the Exalted God that Hayyan narrated this narration for me.’ Hayyan said, ‘Bear witness before the Honorable the Exalted God that Al-Rabi’a ibn Jameel narrated this narration for me.’ Al-Rabi’a ibn Jameel said, ‘Bear witness before the Honorable the Exalted God that Malik ibn Zamre narrated this narration for me.’ Mailk ibn Zamre said, ‘Bear witness before the Honorable the Exalted God that Abuzar al-Qaffari narrated this narration for me.’ Abuzar al-Qaffari said a similar thing indicating that God’s Prophet (MGB) had narrated that for him and added that God’s Prophet had said that Gabriel had narrated this on the authority of the Blessed the Sublime God.”"

The ones from amongst the Emigrants (Muhajerin) were Sa’ed ibn Al-As; al-Miqdad ibn al-Aswad; Abi ibn Ka’ab; Ammar ibn Yasir; Abuzar al-Qaffari; Salman al-Farsi; Abdullah ibn Mas’ood; and Baridat al-Aslami. And those who were from the Helpers (Ansar) were Khazimat ibn Sabit Zulshahadatein; Sahl ibn Hanif; Abu Ayoob Al-Ansari; Abul Haysam ibn al-Tayhan and others.When Abu Bakr sat on God’s Prophet’s (MGB) pulpit as the Caliph they consulted with each other in this regard. Some of them said, ‘Let us go and force him down from the pulpit.’ The others said, ‘This would be like contributing to our own destruction and the Honorable the Exalted God has said, ‘And make not your own hands contribute to (your) destruction;’ It is better that we all go to see Ali ibn Abi Talib (MGB) and consult with him to see what he says.’Then they all went to see Ali (MGB) and said, ‘O the Commander of the Faithful! You have given up your position and your due right. We do not want to take Abu Bakr down from the pulpit without consulting with you.’Ali (MGB) told them, ‘A war would break out if you do so. You are nothing when compared with them in terms of force. The people have agreed to hisCaliphate now and have not acted according to what the Prophet (MGB) said. They have denied their Lord! I consulted with my family on this issue. They believe that there is no solution except being silent since these people hate the Honorable the Exalted God and the Prophet’s Household. They want to retaliate for the blood shed in the Age of Ignorance. I swear by God that if you do so, they will unsheathe their swords and become ready for a battle as they quarreled with me so much that they defeated me; dominated over me; surrounded me and said, ‘Either you pledge allegiance or we will kill you.’ I had no way except to protect myself since I remembered the words of God’s Prophet (MGB) who told me, ‘O Ali! If these people did not let you become the Caliph; disagreed with you and disobeyed my orders regarding you, you must be patient until God descends an order for you. Beware that they will certainly deceive you. You should not give them any excuses, since then they will belittle you and shed your blood. Gabriel has informed me on the authority of the Blessed the Sublime God that the nation will break their pledge of allegiance after me.’ You should all go to that man and tell him what you have heard from your Prophet (MGB), so that he may have no doubts in what he is doing. It would be best to give him an ultimatum so that he deserves a greater punishment from his Lord, since he has disobeyed God’s Prophet (MGB) and has acted against his orders.’Then they all waited until Friday when they surrounded the pulpit of God’s Prophet (MGB). The Helpers (Ansar) told the Emigrants (Muhajerin), ‘Indeed the Honorable the Exalted God has preferred you to the Helpers and said, ‘Allah turned with favor to the Prophet, the Muhajers and the Ansar …’ Therefore, you may speak first. Because of this the first one who stood up and started to speak was Khalid ibn Saeed ibn Aas with the support of the Umayyads. He said, ‘O Abu Bakr! I admonish you to fear God. You well know what God’s Prophet (MGB) has said about Ali (MGB). Don’t you know that on the day of the Battle of the Qariza clan, (when we were all around him) faced the noble ones of us - and said, ‘O Emigrants (Muhajerin) and Helpers (Ansar)! I have a recommendation to you which you must honor. I have an order which you must obey. Beware that Ali (MGB) is your Commander and my Trustee after me. My Lord advised me so. If you do not respect my will in this regard, and do not support and assist him, you will fall into disunion regarding your decrees. Your religious affairs will be in a mess, and the most wicked ones amongst you will take charge of your affairs. The members of my Household are in charge of the affairs after me. They are to run the affairs of my nation after me. O my Lord! Please include anyone who honors my will regarding Ali (MGB)to be amongst those who are resurrected along with me. Also grant them some of my Friendship with which they can become prosperous in the Hereafter. O my God! Please forbid Paradise which is wider than the heavens and the Earth for whoever mistreats my Household.’When Khalid said this Umar ibn al-Khat’tab yelled and said, ‘O Khalid! Shut up. You are not one of the members of the council or the ones on whose sayings we could rely.’Then Khalid said, ‘O Ibn al-Khat’tab! You should shut up. I swear by God that you well know that you are not just saying what you yourself think. Rather, you are defending other people’s interests. I swear by God that all of the Quraysh know that my lineage is nobler than everyone else. I am the most literate, the most well-known one and expect the least from God and His Prophet (MGB), but you are of the worst lineage, the most infamous one that is much more distant from the Honorable the Exalted God and His Prophet (MGB). Indeed you are a coward in fighting, stingy at times of drought, and of a base lineage. You have nothing to be proud of amongst the Quraysh.’ Thus, Khalid silenced him and sat down.Then Abuzar - may God have Mercy upon him - stood up, praised God, expressed God’s glorifications and said, ‘O group of the Emigrants (Muhajerin) and the Helpers (Ansar)! You and the good ones amongst you all know well that God’s Prophet (MGB) said, ‘The Rule over the affairs belongs to Ali (MGB) after me. After him, it belongs to Al-Hassan (MGB) and al-Hussein (MGB). Then after them it belongs to the members of my Holy Household from the progeny of Al-Hussein (MGB). You have ignored what God’s Prophet (MGB) said. You have become materialists and have forgotten what God’s Prophet (MGB) said. You have forsaken the permanent blessings of the Hereafter which is everlasting and never ends or gets ruined where the residents neither grieve nor die. You have become just like the deviated nations who changed the orders of their Prophets after them. Soon you will be bitterly punished for your deeds. God doesn’t oppress His servants.’Abuzar finished his speech and then Salman al-Farsi - may God have Mercy upon him - stood up and said, ‘O Abu Bakr! Who do you cite when you issue your judgements and to whom do you seek refuge when you are asked things which you do not know? Who is more knowledgeable in the nation than you are? Who is closer to God’s Prophet (MGB) than you are? Who has a more extensive background with God’s Prophet (MGB) than you do? You have ignored the Prophet’s orders which he (MGB) issued when he (MGB) was alive. You have forgotten the Prophet’s (MGB) will. Soon everythingwill become very clear for you when you die and enter the graveyard with a heavy load of sins and wicked deeds. When you enter your grave you will find exactly what you sent ahead of yourself. If you pay attention to the truth and be fair and acknowledge the right of the just ones, it will save you on a Day on which you will be in need of your own deeds and when you will be left alone in your grave with your (own) deeds. You have heard what we have heard and you have seen what we have seen. Why do these remarks not prevent you from doing what you are doing? I beseech you by God to consider God. Whoever ponders over things in advance would act according to what is right.’Then Al-Miqdad ibn al-Aswad - may God have Mercy upon him - stood up and said, ‘O Abu Bakr! First measure yourself and see how much you measure up to. Sit in your own house and cry over your sins, since that would be better for you in this life and after your death. Return the position of the Caliphate to the one whom God and His Prophet (MGB) have already determined. Do not rely on this world as your supporter and do not let these lowly people deceive you. Soon the world will end for you and you will be taken to your Lord to be rewarded for what you have done. You know well that the position of the Caliphate belongs to Ali (MGB). He (MGB) is the one to whom it belongs to after God’s Prophet (MGB). I have only advised you. You may accept it or not as you please.’Then Barideh Aslami stood up and said, ‘O Abu Bakr! Have you really forgotten things or do you pretend to have forgotten? Are you deceiving yourself? Don’t you remember that God’s Prophet (MGB) ordered us to greet Ali (MGB) as the Commander of the Faithful during his lifetime. Fear God and get a grip on yourself before it gets too late. Save yourself from destruction! Leave the position of Caliphate and entrust it to the one who deserves it. Do not go astray. Return while you still can. I have only advised you and did my best. You may accept it or not as you please. You will become triumphant and prosper if you accept it.’Then Abdullah ibn Mas’ood stood up and said, ‘O the Quraysh clan! You and all the good ones amongst you well know that the members of the Household of your Prophet are closer to God’s Prophet (MGB) than you are. If you claim the position of the Caliphate to be for the relatives of God’s Prophet (MGB) and say you have a background in Islam, then the members of the Household of God’s Prophet (MGB) are closer to him (MGB) than you are. They are closer to God’s Prophet (MGB) and have a more extensive background with him. Ali ibn Abi Talib (MGB) is in charge of this after your Prophet (MGB). Therefore, entrust to him what God has already entrusted him with and do not step backwards, since then you may experience a detrimental ending.’Then, Ammar ibn Yasir stood up and said, ‘O Abu Bakr! Do not grasp by force the right which God has granted to someone else. Do not be the first one to disobey God’s Prophet and oppose him regarding his Household. Return the right to its owner. Lighten the load and burden on your back and meet God’s Prophet in such a manner that he (MGB) may be pleased with you. Then you may go to the Merciful God for the Reckoning of your deeds and asking you about what you have done.’Then Khuzayma ibn Sabit Zul-Shuhadatayn stood up and said, ‘O Abu Bakr! Don’t you know that God’s Prophet accepted my testimony alone and did not ask for anyone else’s testimony?’ Abu Bakr replied, ‘Yes.’ Khuzayma said, ‘I swear by God and bear witness that I heard God’s Prophet (MGB) say, ‘The members of my Household are the ones who distinguish the difference between right and wrong. In fact, they are the Divine Leaders whom you must follow.’’Then Abul Haysam ibn al-Teehan stood up and said, ‘O Abu Bakr! I bear witness to the Prophet (MGB) and his Holy Household that God’s Prophet (MGB) raised up Ali (MGB) by his arm.’Then the Helpers said, ‘The Prophet (MGB) indeed raised him up by his arm for the position of Trusteeship.’ Others said, ‘The Prophet (MGB) raised him up so that the people could know who is the Master of whomever the Prophet (MGB) is the master of and that the Prophet (MGB) had said, ‘Beware that the members of my Household are the stars on the Earth! Honor them and do not surpass them.’’Then Sahl ibn Hanif stood up and said, ‘I bear witness that I have heard God’s Prophet (MGB) say the following from the pulpit, ‘Your Divine Leader after me will be Ali ibn Abi Talib (MGB). He is the one person who is the most caring of the nation!’’Then Abu Ayoob al-Ansari stood up and said, ‘Fear God regarding the members of the Holy Household of your Prophet and return this Rule to them. You should listen and obey as we did from the Prophet (MGB) in one position after another as they are more deserving for that rank than you are.’ Then he sat down.Then Zayd ibn Wahab stood up and spoke. Then a group of people stood up after him and spoke likewise saying similar things.It has been reported on the authority of one of the trustworthy companions of God’s Prophet that after this session Abu Bakr stayed in his house for three days. On the third day Umar ibn al-Khat’tab, Talha, Zubayr, Uthman ibn Affan, Abdul Rahman ibn Oaf, Sa’ed ibn Abi Vaq’qas, Abu Ubaydat ibn al-Jarah each accompanied with ten men armed with swords went to his house and took him to the pulpit. One of them announced, ‘Should any of you say what he said before, we shall tear him into pieces with our swords.’ Thus, they stayed home and did not say anything any more."

The Imam (MGB) said, “The Honorable the Exalted God brought about twelve clans from the Children of Israel - that is Jacob the son of Isaac the son of Abraham (MGB).

God also generated twelve clans from the progeny of Al-Hassan (MGB) and Al-Hussein (MGB) - the sons of the Commander of the Faithful Imam Ali (MGB) and the Blessed Fatimah (MGB) who was the daughter of God’s Prophet (MGB).” Then the Imam (MGB) added by naming the twelve clans from the Children of Israel as follows, “Reuben - the son of Jacob; Simeon - the son of Jacob; Judah - the son of Jacob; Isaac - the son of Jacob; Zebulun - the son of Jacob; Joseph - the son of Jacob; Benjamin - the son of Jacob; Naphtali - the son of Jacob; Dan - the son of Jacob.”He (MGB) added, “And six clans were brought about from the progeny of Al-Hassan (MGB).

A man entered the mosque and said, ‘O commander of the faithful (referring to Umar)! I am one of the Jews. I am their great scholar. I wish to ask you about some problems. I will embrace Islam if you can convince me.’ Umar said, ‘What are they?’ He said, ‘Three, three and one. I will ask you if you please or guide me to ask anyone else who is more knowledgeable if you wish.’ Umar said, ‘Go and ask that young fellow who is Ali ibn Abi Talib (MGB).’ The Jew went to Ali (MGB) and asked him questions. Ali (MGB) said, ‘Why did you say three, three and one but did not say seven?’ The Jew said, ‘That would have been due to my ignorance! If you could not answer the first three questions, there would be no need to ask the rest.’ Ali (MGB) said, ‘Will you accept Islam if I give you the correct answers?’ The Jew said, ‘Yes, I will.’ Then Ali (MGB) said, ‘Go ahead and ask.’ The Jew asked, ‘Which were the first rock placed on the Earth, the first spring which gushed out of the Earth and the first tree which grew on the Earth?’ Ali (MGB) replied, ‘O Jew! You say that the first rock placed on the Earth was the one in Bayt ul- Muqadas (Holy Shrine in Jerusalem), but you lie. It was the rock which Adam brought down to the Earth from Heaven. You say that the first spring which gushed out of the Earth was one in Bayt ul-Muqadas (Holy Shrine in Jerusalem) but you lie. That spring was the spring of youth in which Yushu ibn Noon washed the fish and the same one from which Khizr drank. Whoever drinks from it will become eternal.’ The Jew said, ‘You are right. This has been recorded in Aaron’s handwriting on the authority of Moses.’ Then Ali (MGB) continued, ‘You say that the first tree which grew on the Earth was an olive tree but you lie. It was the Al-Ajwatdate which Adam brought down to the Earth from Heaven.’ The Jew said, ‘You are right. This has been recorded in Aaron’s handwriting on the authority of Moses.’ Then the Jew asked, ‘Where in Paradise does your Prophet sit?’ Ali (MGB) said, ‘In the noblest and highest place in the Adan Gardens.’ The Jew said, ‘You are right. This has been recorded in Aaron’s handwriting on the authority of Moses.’ Then the Jew asked, ‘Who will accompany him in his place of residence?’ Ali (MGB) replied, ‘The twelve Divine Leaders.’ The Jew said, ‘You are right. This has been recorded in Aaron’s handwriting on the authority of Moses.’ Then the Jew asked the seventh question and accepted Islam. He asked, ‘For how many years will his Trustee live after him?’ Ali (MGB) said, ‘Thirty years.’ He asked, ‘Will he die or will he get killed?’ Ali (MGB) replied, ‘He will be killed with such a blow on the head that his beard will become red with his blood.’ The Jew said, ‘You are right. This has been recorded in Aaron’s handwriting on the authority of Moses.’”I have recorded this book from its various chains of narrators in Awael."

He said, ‘Indeed the Divine Leader, the Proof over the believers, the one in charge of the affairs; the one who speaks the Quran and is aware of the decrees is no one but the brother of God’s Prophet, the Prophet’s Caliph reigning over his nation, and his friend who is in the same position in relation to the Prophet (MGB) that Aaron was to Moses (MGB). He is the one whom we must obey as the Honorable the Exalted God says, ‘O ye who believe! Obey Allah, and obey the Messenger, and those charged with authority among you…’ He is the one whom God has described as, ‘Your (real) friends are (no less than) Allah, His Messenger, and the (fellowship of) believers,- those who establish regular prayers and regular charity, and they bow down humbly (in worship).’ You are invited to accept his mastery. He is the one whose Divine Leadership was firmly established on the day of Qadir Khum when God’s Prophet (MGB) said, ‘Am I not more of a Master over you than you yourselves are?’ The people replied, ‘Yes. O Prophet of God.’ Then the Prophet (MGB) said, ‘Whomever I am the Master of, Ali is the Master of. O my God! Please be the friend of his friends and be the enemy of his enemies. Assist whoever assists him, and abandon whoever abandons him. Help whoever helps him. He is Ali ibn Abi Talib (MGB). He is the Commander of the Faithful, the Divine Leader of the pious ones, the Leader of those with white-foreheads , the Noblest of the Trustees, and the best of the people after God’s Prophet (MGB). After him come Al-Hassan ibn Ali (MGB) and Al-Hussein (MGB) - the grandsons of God’s Prophet (MGB), the sons of the best of all women. Then there is Ali ibn al-Hussein (MGB), then Muhammad ibn Ali (MGB), Ali ibn Muhammad (MGB), Al-Hassan ibn Ali (MGB), Muhammad ibn Al-Hassan (MGB) successively up to now. They are the Prophet’s progeny known by their Trusteeship and Divine Leadership. There is no time or era in which the Earth is left without one of them. They are the Reliable Grip, Leaders towards guidance, Proofs for the people of the Earth until God inherits the Earth with whatever is in it. Anyone who opposes them (the Imams) is deviant, misleading, and a deserter of the right and the guidance. They (the Imams) are the interpreters of the Quran and the spokespersons of theProphet (MGB) with directness. Whoever dies before he recognizes them is regarded as one who has died in the Age of Ignorance. Their way consists of piety; chastity; honesty; being good; struggling; returning what you are entrusted with to its owner, whether they are good or bad people; extended prostrations; staying up at night (to worship God); abstaining from the forbidden things; patiently waiting for the arrival of the Savior ; being good-tempered; being on good terms with one’s neighbors.”Then Tamim ibn Buhlool said, “Abu Muawiyah narrated that Al-A’amash quoted a similar narration on the issue of Divine Leadership on the authority of Ja’far ibn Muhammad as-Sadiq (MGB).”"

Go to the people and tell them to declare ‘There is no god but God and Muhammad is God’s Prophet.’The material used in the attire (of contentment) consisted of the following six: its body was made of ruby; its two shirt arms were made of pearls; its gussets were made of yellow crystals, its underarms were made of chrysolite, its neck was made of red coral, its collar was made of the Light of the Lord - may His Majesty be Exalted. God accepted the repentance of Adam because of this attire and gave back Solomon’s ring to him, returned Joseph to Jacob (MGB), rescued Jonah (MGB) from the stomach of the whale and saved other Prophets (MGB) from hardship due to the blessings of this attire that was the attire of Muhammad (MGB).”The compiler of this book said, “The souls of all the believers and the Divine Leaders (MGB) have been created from the light of Muhammad (MGB).”"

Tooba lahum (Blessed be to them) and they shall be prosperous. The word Tooba is the name of a Heavenly tree which is rooted in the Prophet’s (MGB) house. There are branches of this tree in the homes of the believers. These branches will yield whatever you desire. The branches are so extensive that if someone races under them with a fast riding horse for even one-hundred years, he will not leave the shade of this branch. If a crow starts from the base of the tree and tries to fly towards the top, it can never reach there until it gets so old that it turns white. So beware, and try to attain this boundless blessing. Indeed a believer is busy doing his work, and the people are safe from him. When the night comes, he will fall on his noblest body part to prostrate in the worship of the Sublime God. He will ask God who has created him to save him from the Fire of Hell. So beware and try to be this way."""

Nine of them were from the Khazraj clan and three of them were from the O’as clan. The ones from the Khazraj clan were as follows: As’ad ibn Zurarah; Al-Bara’ ibn Ma’rur; Abdullah ibn Amr ibn Haraml - the father of Jabir ibn Abdullah; Rafe’a ibn Malik; Sa’ed ibn Ebadat; Al-Monzar ibn Amr; Abdullah ibn Ravaheh; Sa’ed ibn al-Rabi’a; Ibn al-Qavafil Ebadat al-Samit - and what is meant by Ibn al-Qavafil is those noble men of Khazraj in Medina that no one dared bother anyone who lived under their protection. And the men from the Oa’s tribe were as follows: Abul Haysam ibn al-Teyhan; Aseed ibn Hazir; and Sa’ed ibn Khaysama.” I have recorded the detailed account in my book Kitab Al-Nabuwat. The compiler of the book - may God be pleased with him - said, “The word Naqib translated here as leader or chief refers to the heads or chiefs of the tribes. It has also been said that it refers to trustworthy and honest ones who act as a witness for their tribe. The origin of the word Naqib is the word Naqb which refers to an opening, a tunnel or a ditch in the ground or the hills. One is said to be the leader of his tribe or the chief of his tribe, since he constantly questions about the conditions of the people in the tribe. He is the chief like one who questions about hidden secrets. And the meaning of the following words of the Honorable the Exalted God, ‘…Allah did aforetime take a covenant from the Children of Israel, and we appointed twelve leaders among them’ is that God has chosen one chief from each tribe and has made a covenant with them regarding their religion. Some have said that these chiefs were dispatched to the oppressors to find about their conditions and bring back their news to Moses (MGB). They returned and prevented their tribes from fighting with the oppressors, since they had become frightened of their armaments and physical strength. This is a well-known account. However, we have only meant to describe the meaning of the word Naqib here. May God grant success to good works.”"

The Prophet (MGB) replied, ‘They are in thirteen groups. They are elephant, bear, swine, monkey, seal, lizard, bat, leech, scorpion, spider, rabbit, Canopus and Venus. Then I said, ‘O Prophet of God! What was the reason they were transmuted?’ The Prophet (MGB) replied, ‘The one who was transmuted into an elephant was a man who made love to almost anything.The one who was transmuted into a bear was a shemale who invited men to herself.And the ones that were transmuted into swine were a Christian tribe who asked their Lord to descend water for them. Then when it rained, they blasphemed more and denied God more strongly than before.And the ones that were transmuted into monkeys were a tribe who violated the Shabbat .And the one that was transmuted into a seal was a pimp who invited men to make love to his own wife.And the one that was transmuted into a lizard was a Bedouin Arab who robbed the pilgrims’ crosiers .And the one that was transmuted into a bat was a man who robbed the fruits from the top of palm trees.And the one that was transmuted into a leech was a slanderer who caused disunion between loved ones.And the one who was transmuted into a scorpion was a vulgar man who bothered everyone with his tongue.And the one who was transmuted into a spider was a woman who was disloyal to her husband.And the one that was transmuted into a rabbit was a woman who would not purify herself after menstruation etc.And the one who was transmuted into Canopus was a tax-collector in Yemen.And the one who was transmuted into Venus was a Christian woman who was from some of the Israel monarchs with whom Harut and Marut practiced black witchcraft. Her name was Naheel but the people called her Naheed.The compiler of the book - may God be pleased with him - said, “The people made a mistake about Venus and Canopus and said that they were stars while it was not so. They were transmuted into two aqueous creaturesfrom the sea which were named after two stars from the sky: just as some of the stars in the sky are named after some of the animals on the Earth such as Aries (the Ram), the Taurus (the Bull), Betelgeuse, Cancer (the Raven), Scorpion (the stag), Neptune (the Whale), Capricorn (the goat).Thus, a mistake was made regarding Venus and Canopus since the people cannot see them given that they are two aqueous creatures which exist in the sea and the Honorable the Exalted God would not distort His enemies into the form of bright stars which would illuminate forever. The perverted would not live for more than three days. They will not reproduce either. There are no perverted creatures on the Earth these days. Animals like monkeys, pigs, bears or other similar animals are not perverted themselves, but are similar to those who were cursed and transmuted by the Honorable the Exalted God for denying the Unity of God and denouncing the Prophets. The Blessed the Sublime God has made it forbidden to eat their flesh. I heard this narration from Abil Hussein Muhammad ibn Ja’far Al-Asady - May God be pleased with him."

You should not rush to answer questions before he does. You should not insist when he doesn’t want to respond. You should not be pushy with him (pull on his clothes) when he gets tired. You should not point at him with your fingers. You should not wink at him. You should not whisper in someone’s ears in his class. You should not seek his faults. You should not talk too much or argue with him saying that others have said things opposite to his views. You should not divulge his secrets. You should not gossip about anyone in front of him. You should support him both in his presence and in his absence. When you go to see him with some people present there, you should greet all of them and express especial greetings for him. You should sit in front of him. You should rush to supersede others in fulfilling his needs whenever he needs something. Do not get upset if you have to wait a while to talk with him, since his case is similar to the case of a palm tree. That is, you have to wait for a while before you can get some dates. A scholar is just like one who fasts, stays up at night and strives in the way of God. Once a scholar dies it causes a gap in Islam which can never be filled up until the Resurrection Day.

The same tradition has been narrated by Bakr ibn Abdullah ibn Habib, on the authority of Al-Hassan ibn Sanán, on the authority of his father, on the authority of Muhammad ibn Khalid al-Barqy, on the authority of Muslim ibn Khalid that Ja’far ibn Muhammad as-Sadiq (MGB) said: “Thirteen groups (Tamim said sixteen groups) of the nation of my grandfather (MGB) do not like us. They do not teach the people to love us. They detest us. They do not follow us. They abandon us and advise the people to abandon us. They are truly our enemies and they deserve the Fire of Hell.” He was asked, ‘O (grand)son of God’s Prophet (MGB)! May God fend them off from you. Who are they?’ He (MGB) said, “They are the following: (1) Those who have an extra organ. You cannot find any one who has an extra organ but that he is an enemy of us and he does not show loyalty to us. (2) Those who are born defective. There are none whom the honorable the Exalted God has created to be defective who are not opposed to us in their hearts. (3) Those who are one-eyed from birth (the right eye in specific). You will not find anyone whom God has created to be blind but that he fights against us and he is on peaceful terms with our enemies. (4) The men with ever-lasting black hair - those whose hair never turns grey no matter how long they live. Their beard stays black like the neck of a crow. They always raly the people against us and increase the number of our enemies. (5) Men who are really dark. You will not find anyone of them but that he curses at us and praises our enemies. (6) Bald men. You do not see any bald men but that he slanders, defames, and goes about with slander against us. (7) The men who are greenish. Although they are many, no one of such men but that he welcomes us in our presence but defames us in our absence (i.e. two-faced), seeking to betray us. (8) The ostracized men. Whenever you meet any of them, you will find them incurring the animosity of us and openly misleading the people. (9) The leprous men. Whenever you meet any of them, you will find them waylaying us and ambushing our followers and us, intending to mislead us from the straight path. (10) The leucodermic ones, who are the firewood of Hell. They will inevitably be lodged there. (11) The sodomized ones. Whenever you meet any of them, you will find them chanting with dispraise of us and rallying others against us. (12) The people of a twon called Sejestan. They are our enemies and antagonists. They are verily the wickedest of all people and creatures. May the chastisement that is decided for Pharaoh, Haman, and Korah be decided for them. (13) The people of a city called Ray. They are the enemies of Allah, His Messenger, and the Messenger’s Household. They consider waging war against the Prophet’s Household as holy war and they consider their properties to be spoils of war. May the chastisement of disgrace inflict them in this world and in the Hereafter and may endless torture be inflicted upon them. (14) The people of a city called Mosul. They are the most vicious inhabitants of this earth. (15) The people of a city called al-Zawra, which will be built in the future. They quench their thirst with our blood and flatter the rulers by means of showing hatred against us. They show loyalty to our enemies, consider fighting against us as an obligatory duty, and consider waging war agaisnt us as inevitable necessity. O son, beware of these peoples. Beware of them! If two of them can put a hand on one of us, they will definitely intend to kill him. ”"

The Imam was listening. When the Indian doctor finished reading, he asked the Imam , ‘O Aba Abdullah! Do you want me to teach you medicine?’ As-Sadiq replied, ‘No, since what I know is better than what you know.’ The Indian doctor said, ‘What do you know?’ The Imam said, ‘I treat heat with cold, cold with heat, moisture with dryness and dryness with moisture. I leave the rest of the affairs to the Honorable the Exalted God and rely on the Prophet’s saying ‘that the stomach is the center of all ailments and abstinence is the best treatment for all ailments. The body should be given time to get used to things.’ The doctor said, ‘Medicine is nothing else but this.’ As-Sadiq said, ‘Do you think that I have learned these things from books on medicine?’ The Indian doctor said, ‘Yes, I do.’ As-Sadiq said, ‘No. I swear by God that I have only learned these from the Glorified God. Am I better in medicine or you? The Indian doctor said, ‘I am better.’ As-Sadiq said, ‘O Indian! May I then ask you a few questions?’ He said, ‘Go ahead and ask.’"

He (MGB) had five-hundred date palms and used to say two units of prayers under each of them.When he (MGB) prayed, he stood very humbly and his color changed due to his fear of God. He prayed as if a lowly servant was praying in front of a Majestic King. His organs shook as he prayed out of fear of the Honorable the Exalted God. He prayed like one who was saying farewell to praying and that this was going to be his last prayer. One day his cloak fell off his shoulder as he was praying. He did not correct this until after he finished saying his prayers.Some of his companions asked him about the reason for this. He (MGB) replied, ‘Woe to you! Do you know who I was standing before? Indeed only as much of a person’s prayer is accepted that he concentrates on.’ Then the man said, ‘O thus we are all ruined!’Then, the Imam (MGB) said, ‘No! Indeed the Honorable the Exalted God would perfect your prayers with the recommendable (Nafila) prayers whichyou perform.’ The Imam (MGB) often went out in the darkness of the night with a bag on his back in which he (MGB) carried coins. He even carried food and wood on his back. He (MGB) went to the doors, knocked on them and gave things to whoever came out of the house. The Imam (MGB) covered up his face when he (MGB) gave something to the poor so that they could not recognize him. Only when the Imam (MGB) died, did they recognize that it had been him who brought the stuff for them. Once they put his corpse down to perform the ritual ablutions (wuzu) for the deceased, they looked at his back and noticed that it had become rough like a camels’ knees due to carrying heavy loads on his back to the doors of the needy and the poor. One day he went out and he was carrying a fur cloak. A beggar came and hanged onto it. He (MGB) gave it to him and left. He (MGB) bought fur clothes in the winter and sold them it the summer and gave away the money in charity. He (MGB) saw a group of people who were begging on the day of Arafat. He (MGB) said, ‘Woe to you! You should not ask for things from anyone other than God on such a day! Even babies in their mother’s wombs are hoped to be fortunate on this day.’ He (MGB) abstained from eating food with his mother. They asked him (MGB), ‘O son of God’s Prophet (MGB)! You always do good deeds and have good relationships with your next of kin. How come you do not eat any food with her?’ He (MGB) replied, ‘I do not like to reach out for what her eyes may have sought.’ A man asked him (MGB), ‘O son of God’s Prophet! Indeed I really like you for God’s sake, while you despise me.’ He (MGB) went on the Hajj pilgrimage twenty times riding a female camel, and he (MGB) never cracked the whip at it! When the female camel died, he (MGB) ordered that it be buried under the ground so that the beasts do not eat it. Once they asked his female slave about him (MGB). She said, ‘Should I give you a short answer or a long one?’ They said, ‘Give a short reply.’ She said, ‘I never fed him during the day, and never spread out his bed for him at night.’ He ran into a group of people who were gossiping about him. He (MGB) stood in front of them and told them, ‘May God forgive me if you are saying the truth, and may God forgive you if you are lying.’ Whenever a seeker of knowledge came to him, he (MGB) said, ‘Hail to what is recommended by God’s Prophet.’ Then he (MGB) said, ‘Indeed when a seeker of knowledge leaves his house and walks on wet or dry things, everything as deep down as the seventh level beneath the Earth will say glorifications for him.’ He (MGB) used to feed one-hundred poor families in Medina. He (MGB) liked the orphans, the helpless ones, the weak and the helpless beggars to sit at his table-cloth . He fed them with his own hand and gave the married ones some food to take for the wives. He (MGB)never ate anything unless he (MGB) gave the equal of it in charity. He (MGB) prayed so much that the places of his body where he prostrated peeled off seven times each year. He collected them and these were buried with him when he died. He (MGB) cried twenty years for his father Al-Hussein (MGB). He cried every time they brought him some food. Once his servant said, ‘O son of God’s Prophet! Your sorrow is endless and I am afraid that you may die.’ He (MGB) said, ‘Woe to you! Indeed the Prophet Jacob (MGB) had twelve sons. God made one of them absent. He (MGB) cried so much for him that his eyes turned white and all the hair on his head got white due to grief. Moreover, his back was bent in his sorrow while his son was alive in this world. However, I have seen my father, my brother, my uncle and seventy members of my family get killed. How can I overcome my grief.’"

Teaching knowledge to the one who doesn’t know it is giving charity. Granting knowledge to the proper persons brings God’s pleasure, since one knows the lawful and the unlawful using knowledge and knowledge would lead its seeker to Paradise. Knowledge is a guide in case of fear; it is a companion in case of loneliness; it is a guide in case of hardships; it is a weapon against the enemies; and an ornament in the presence of friends. God promotes some people by means of knowledge to such a high rank that they are the leaders of goodness and must be obeyed. Their deeds must be taken into consideration and their works must be followed. The angels are inclined to be their friends and they anoint them with their own wings while they pray. Everything including the fish in the sea, the beasts in the desert and the quadrupeds ask for forgiveness for them since knowledge brings life to the hearts and light to the eyes and power against sluggishness. God opens the doors to the homes of the good people for the learned men. He grants them association with the good ones in this world and in the Hereafter. God is obeyed and served by means of knowledge. God is recognized as One by means of knowledge. The bonds of relationship are fastened by means of knowledge. What is lawful and unlawful is recognized by means of knowledge. Knowledge is the prelude to action. Any action follows knowledge. God inspires it to the blessed ones and deprives the miserable ones from it.’"

What was the leaf sent to Abraham about?’ The Prophet (MGB) replied, ‘It all contained proverbs and pieces of advice such as ‘O proud king! I did not appoint you to collect worldly wealth! Rather I appointed you so that you do not let the oppressed ask me for their needs! I shall not turn down the prayers of the oppressed even if they are atheists. A wise man whose mind has not been overwhelmed should divide up his time into three portions. He should supplicate to his Honorable and the Exalted Lord in one portion of his time. He should reckon his deeds in another portion of his time. And in the third portion he should ponder over what the Honorable the Exalted God has created. He should also spent some time in private to enjoy the lawful pleasures. This would assist him in the performance of what he has to do in the other portions of his time. It would calm his heart and prepare him for the rest of his deeds. A wise man should see his life’s condition, recognize his own position and keep his tongue in his mouth. One who considers what he says as a part of his deeds would speak a little and only when it would benefit him. A wise man should always seeks three things. He should either improve his life, provide the savings for the Hereafter, or enjoy the lawful things.’ I asked, ‘O Prophet of God! What was the leaf revealed to Moses about?’ The Prophet (MGB) replied, ‘It was all in Hebrew. It contained advice such as, ‘I wonder how one who believes in death can be happy! I wonder how one who believes in the Reckoning and the Resurrection Day can laugh! I wonder how one who has seen this world and its vicissitudes can trust it! I wonder how one who believes in destiny can exert useless efforts! I wonder how one who believes in the Reckoning of deeds doesn’t do anything for his eternity?’ I asked, ‘O Prophet of God! Do we have any of what God revealed to Moses and Abraham in what God has revealed to you?’ The Prophet (MGB) replied, ‘O Abuzar! Read: ‘He is successful who growth, And remembereth the name of his Lord, so prayeth. But ye prefer the life of the world although the Hereafter is better and more lasting. Lo! This is in the former scrolls: The Book of Abraham and Moses.’ I said, ‘O Prophet of God! Please give me some advice.’ The Prophet (MGB) said, ‘I advise you to fear God as that is the utmost important issue.’ I said, ‘O Prophet of God! Give me more advice.’ The Prophet (MGB) said, ‘I advise you to recite the Quran, remember God often as possible, since then you will be remembered in the Heavens and your light shall shine upon the Earth.’ I said, ‘O Prophet of God! Please give me more advice.’ The Prophet (MGB) said, ‘I advise you to be as quiet as possible, since that would fend off Satan who is the main enemy of your religion.’ I said, ‘O Prophet of God! Give me more advice.’ The Prophet (MGB) said, ‘I admonish you against laughing a lot, since that would cause the heart to perish and the light of your face to fade.’ I said, ‘O Prophet of God! Please give me more advice.’ The Prophet (MGB) said, ‘I advise you to always consider the situation of the people who are in an inferior position than you are, not those who are in a better position than you are. This way you will be more grateful for what God has bestowed upon you.’ I said, ‘O Prophet of God! Please give me more advice.’ The Prophet (MGB) said, ‘I advise you to visit your relations of kin even if they may have cut off from you.’ I said, ‘O Prophet of God! Please give me more advice.’ The Prophet (MGB) said, ‘I advise you to like the poor and associate with them.’ I said, ‘O Prophet of God! Please give me more advice.’ The Prophet (MGB) said, ‘I advise you to tell the truth even though it may be unpleasant.’ I said, ‘O Prophet of God! Please give me more advice.’ The Prophet (MGB) said, ‘I advise you not to fear the blame of those who blame you for the sake of God.’ I said, ‘O Prophet of God! Please give me more advice.’ The Prophet (MGB) said, ‘I advise you that what you know about yourself should hinder you from finding faults with others.’ Then the Prophet (MGB) said, ‘It is bad enough for one to have three characteristics: to know faults in others while he himself has them and is unaware of them; to feel ashamed of what others do while he himself has those characteristics to be ashamed of; and unduly hurt his companions.’ Then the Prophet (MGB) added, ‘There is no intellect better than moderation; there is no piety like abstinence from the acts that God has forbidden; and there is no good thing like being good-tempered.’"

He is the most knowledgeable, the wisest, the most pious, the most patient, the bravest, the most generous, and the person who worships the most among the people. He was born circumcised. He is pure and clean. He sees the back as well he sees the front. He has no shadow. When he fell out of his mother’s uterus onto the ground, he fell onto the palms of his hands and loudly declared the twotestimonial declarations (that there is no god but God, and that Muhammad is God’s Messenger). He has no nocturnal pollution. His eyes go to sleep, but his heart will not go to sleep. He is inspired . The armor of God’s Prophet (MGB) fits him. His urine and feces cannot be seen since the Almighty God has appointed the Earth to swallow whatever he excretes even though it smells like musk. He has power over the people, although he is kinder to them than their own parents are. He is the humblest of all people before the Almighty God. He acts upon what he advises the people to do more than anyone else. He abstains from what he admonishes the people against. His prayers are accepted such that if he wishes a rock to be divided into two parts, it will. He has the weapon of the Prophet of God (MGB). He has his sword - the Zul-Faqar . He has a list of the names of his followers up until the Resurrection Day. He has a list of the names of his enemies up until the Resurrection Day. He possesses Al-Jame’a - that is a nearly thirty-five meter long text which encompasses all of the needs of the human beings. He also possesses the Jafr-i-Akbar and Jafr-i-Asqar that are a goat-skin and a ram-skin which include all knowledge - even the punishment for a scratch or one, a half or a third of a crack of a whip. He also possesses the Blessed Fatimah’s (MGB) Mushaf."

There is a column of light between him and God with which he sees the deeds of the people. He is informed about what he needs by it.As-Sadiq (MGB) said, “This column of light is sometimes opened up to us and we get to know and it sometimes gets closed and we no longer know. The Imam is born. He also has children. He gets ill and he gets cured. He eats and drinks. He urinates and defecates. He gets sad. He laughs and cries. He lives and then dies. He is buried and the people go to visit his shrine. These conditions for him are general. There are two specific and important signs for him: his knowledge and the fulfillment of his prayers. He has heard the news that he gives about the events in the future from his grandfathers and they do so from the Prophet of God (MGB). The Prophet of God (MGB) has heard them from Gabriel. Gabriel has heard them from the Almighty God. All the eleven Imams after the Prophet (MGB) were martyred. Some were martyred by the sword - that is the Commander of the Faithful Imam Ali (MGB) and Al-Hussein (MGB). The rest of them were poisoned by the disobedient rulers of their time. The martyrdom of the Imams has been a real issue - not the way the Boasters believe and those who believe in turning over the authority believe - May God’s Curse Be on Them. They say, ‘In fact, they were not killed. The people thought they were. They are liars. May God’s Wrath be upon them. There areno cases of the Prophets and the Imams in which the people just thought they were killed, but they were not; except for Jesus the son of Mary (MGB), since he was taken up alive from the Earth. His spirit was taken away in between the heavens and the Earth. Then he was taken up to the heavens where his spirit was returned to him. The followings Words of the Almighty God refer to this, “Behold! God said, O Jesus! I will take thee and raise thee to Myself and clear thee (of the falsehoods) of those who blaspheme.” The Almighty God also expressed what Jesus (MGB) will say on the Resurrection Day as follows, “... And I was a witness over them whilst I dwelt amongst them. When Thou didst take me up, Thou was the Watcher over them, and Thou art a witness to all things.” And the people who have transgressed beyond bounds regarding the Immaculate Imams (MGB) say, “If it is allowed for the people to think Jesus (MGB) who was not killed was killed, why should a similar issue not hold true for the Imams?” Their reply is, “Jesus (MGB) was created without a father. Why is it not allowed that the Immaculate Imams (MGB) be also created without having a father?” They will not dare express their opinion on this issue. May God Damn Them! When all the Prophets, Messengers and Imams after Adam have been created from a father and a mother - with Jesus being the only exception having only a mother - it is allowed for the people to think he was killed while he was not. This doesn’t hold true for other Prophets and Imams. The Almighty God wished to establish Jesus (MGB) as a sign and a symbol for us to know that God is able to do anything."

He (MGB) replied, ‘There are thirty-four groups of women with whom having intercourse has been forbidden. Seventeen cases have been declared forbidden in the Holy Quran, and seventeen cases have been declared forbidden in the traditions. What has come in the Quran is as follows. The first case is adultery as the Honorable the Exalted God has says, ‘Nor come nigh to adultery…’ The second case is marrying women whom one’s father has married as the Honorable the Exalted God says, ‘And marry not women whom your fathers married…’ And the other cases are as follows, ‘‘Prohibited to you (For marriage) are:- Your mothers, daughters, sisters; father’s sisters, mother’s sisters; brother’s daughters, sister’s daughters; foster-mothers (who gave you suck), foster-sisters; your wives’ mothers; your step-daughters under your guardianship, born of your wives to whom ye have gone in,- no prohibition if ye have not gone in;- (Those who have been) wives of your sons proceeding from your loins; and two sisters in wedlock at one and the same time, except for what is past;’And the other cases also include women in their period of menstruation as the Honorable the Exalted God says, ‘And do not approach them until they are clean.’And the other cases also include associating with women while we are in retreat in the mosque as the Honorable the Exalted God says, ‘But do not associate with your wives while ye are in retreat in the mosques.’The cases that have been declared forbidden in the traditions are as follows. The first case is having intercourse during the days of the month of Ramazan. The second is marrying with a women who has taken the oath of condemnation after she has taken it. The third case is marrying women during the period of prohibition ; having intercourse while in the state of ritual consecration (Ihram); marrying familiar ones to whom you are forbidden to marry (since that would constitute incest); marrying a woman who has been divorced by Zihar before the payment of expiation ; marrying unbelieving women ; for a man to ever again marry a woman after he has divorced her nine times ; marrying a slave after marrying a free woman ; marrying your wife’s paternal or maternal aunts ; marrying a slave girl without the consent of her master; marrying a slave girl by a man who can afford to marry a free woman; marrying a captured female slave before her being assigned to be in someone’s possession; marrying an unbelieving woman ; having sex with a bought female slave before her being purified by Istebra ; and having sex with a ransomed slave woman after some of the ransom money has been paid.’”"

صوم الاباحة فمن أكل أو شرب ناسيا أو تقيأ من غير تعمد فقد أباح الله ذلك له وأجزأ عنه صومه. أما صوم السفر والمرض فإن العامة اختلفت فيه فقال قوم: يصوم، وقال قوم: لا يصوم، وقال قوم: إن شاء صام وإن شاء

"".","22-2 (The compiler of the book narrated) that my father - may God be pleased with him - narrated that Sa’ed ibn Abdullah quoted Al-Qasim ibn Muhammad al-Isfahani, on the authority of Suleiman ibn Davood al-Munqeri, on the authority of Sufyan ibn Ayyineh, on the authority of Al-Zuhra, “I went to see Ali ibn al-Hussein (MGB). The Imam (MGB) asked, ‘Where do you come from?’ I said, ‘I am coming from the mosque.’ The Imam (MGB) asked, ‘What were you talking about?’ I said, ‘We were talking about fasting. My friends and I reached the conclusion that there are no other obligatory fasts except that of the month of Ramazan.’The Imam (MGB) said, ‘O Al-Zuhra! It is not so. There are forty types of fasting. Ten of these types are obligatory fasts like that of the month of Ramazan. Ten of these types are forbidden. Fourteen of these types are such that one who is of age can either fast on those days or break them. Also there are three types of fasting with permission: fasting for learning; permitted fasting; and fasting during illness or on a journey.’I said, ‘May I be your ransom! Please explain these for me.’The Imam (MGB) said, ‘The obligatory fasts are the fasting for the month of Ramazan; and fasting for two consecutive months as a compensation for intentionally breaking one’s fast during the month of Ramazan; fasting for two consecutive months as a compensation of unintentionally killing a believer in case one cannot find a slave to free. As the Honorable the Exalted God says, ‘Never should a believer kill a believer; but (If it so happens) by mistake, (Compensation is due): If one (so) kills a believer, it is ordained that he should free a believing slave, and pay compensation to the deceased’s family, unless they remit it freely. If the deceased belonged to a people at war with you, and he was a believer, the freeing of a believing slave (Is enough). If he belonged to a people with whom ye have treaty of Mutual alliance, compensation should be paid to his family, and a believing slave be freed. For those who find this beyond their means, (isprescribed) a fast for two months running…” . Another obligatory fasting is for two consecutive months as a compensation for divorcing one’s wife by Zihar in case one cannot find a slave to free as the Blessed the Sublime God says, ‘But those who divorce their wives by Zihar, then wish to go back on the words they uttered, (it is ordained that such a one) should free a slave before they touch each other: Thus are ye admonished to perform: and God is well-acquainted with (all) that ye do. And if any has not (the wherewithal), he should fast for two months consecutively before they touch each other.’Three days of fasting is obligatory for the compensation for a deliberate oath for the person who cannot feed the poor people as the Blessed the Sublime God says, ‘Allah will not call you to account for what is futile in your oaths, but He will call you to account for your deliberate oaths: for expiation, feed ten indigent persons, on a scale of the average for the food of your families; or clothe them; or give a slave his freedom. If that is beyond your means, fast for three days. That is the expiation for the oaths ye have sworn. But keep to your oaths. Thus doth Allah make clear to you His signs, that ye may be grateful.’ This fasting should be performed continuously and it cannot be done on various scattered days.Then there is the fasting for shaving the hair on the head before the offering reaches the place of sacrifice as the Blessed the Sublime God has ordained, ‘And complete the Hajj or Umra in the service of Allah. But if ye are prevented (from completing it), send an offering for sacrifice, such as ye may find, and do not shave your heads until the offering reaches the place of sacrifice. And if any of you is ill, or has an ailment in his scalp, (necessitating shaving), (He should) in compensation either fast, or feed the poor, or offer sacrifice…’ One is free to perform either of the above three, but if he decides to fast he should fast for three days.Then there is the fasting as a compensation for not affording to make an offering for Hajj in which case one must fast for three days during the Hajj and seven days upon his return making it ten days of fasting in all as the Blessed the Sublime God says, ‘…He must make an offering, such as he can afford, but if he cannot afford it, he should fast three days during the Hajj and seven days on his return, making ten days in all.’Then there is the fasting as a compensation for the intentional killing of game while in the sacred precincts or in pilgrim garb as the Blessed the Sublime God says, ‘O ye who believe! Allah doth but make a trial of you in a little matter of game well within reach of your hands and your lances, that He may test who feareth him unseen: any who transgress thereafter, willhave a grievous penalty. O ye who believe! Kill not game while in the sacred precincts or in pilgrim garb. ‘If any of you doth so intentionally, the compensation is an offering, brought to the Ka’ba, of a domestic animal equivalent to the one he killed, as adjudged by two just men among you; or by way of atonement, the feeding of the indigent; or its equivalent in fasts…’ ”Then the Imam (MGB) asked, ‘O Al-Zuhra! Do you know how ‘its equivalent in fasts’ can be measured?’ I replied, ‘No. I do not know.’ The Imam (MGB) said, ‘They should determine the price of the game (that has been killed) and measure its equivalent in wheat using As-Sa’ . They must fast one day for each half of one As-Sa’.Then there is the obligatory fasting for a vow and seclusion in the mosque (I’tekaf).And the fasts that are forbidden are: fasting on the Eid ul-Fitr; fasting on Eid ul-Azha; fasting on three days of Al-Tashriq ; fasting on a day which is doubtful whether it is the end of Sha’ban or the start of Ramazan. We have been ordered to fast on that day with the intention that it is the last day of Sha’ban. We have been admonished against fasting on that day as one of the days of the month of Ramazan when the people are in doubt about that day.”Then I asked, ‘May I be your ransom! What should one do who has not fasted at all during the month of Sha’ban?’ The Imam (MGB) replied, ‘He should make the intention to fast for the last day of Sha’ban on that night. This would be fine if it turns out to be the first day of Ramazan. He would have nothing to lose if it turns out to be the last day of Sha’ban.’Then I asked, ‘How would a recommendable day of fasting be counted for an obligatory day of fasting?’ The Imam (MGB) replied, ‘If anyone unknowingly intends to make a recommendable fast on one of the days of the month of Ramazan and then he finds out that it has been in the month of Ramazan, that day of fasting counts as fasting on an obligatory day since the fasting on that very same day has been obligatory for him.’It is also unlawful to join two consecutive days of fasting together - that is fasting during one day and not eating at night and then fasting on the following day. It is unlawful to observe silence fasting. It is unlawful to observe fasting for a vow regarding a sin. It is unlawful to observe fasting all year long.Then there are the optional fasts which are fasting on Fridays, Thursdays and Mondays and fasting on three days in the middle of each lunar month; fasting on six days in the month of Shawwal (except for the first of Shawwalwhich is Eid ul-Fitr); fasting on the Day of Arafat on the ninth of Dhul-Hijja; and fasting on the day of Ashura that is the tenth day of Muharram. One is free to fast or not on these days.And then there is the case of fasts which require permission to do. Wives cannot fast unless with the permission of their husbands; slaves cannot fast unless with the permission of their masters; and guests cannot fast unless with the permission of their hosts. Regarding a guest who should not fast except with the permission of his host God’s Prophet (MGB) has said, ‘One who is a guest somewhere should not fast without the consent of his host.’ Fasting for learning refers to when a child who is nearly of age is asked to fast in order to learn how to do so. This is considered for learning and is not obligatory. Or the case of one on a journey who eats in the morning then he abstains from eating during the rest of the day. This is a form of fasting that is not obligatory.And ‘permitted’ fasts refers to the case of the fasting of one who eats or drinks unintentionally (for having forgotten that he is fasting), or one who vomits unintentionally during his fast. He shall receive the reward of having fasted.In the case of fasting while you are on a journey or when you are ill, there is some disagreement in public opinion. Some say that one should fast while others say one should break his fast. Still another group say that one is free to chose. He can either fast or break his fast in these conditions. However, we say that one should break his fast in both cases. If one fasts during a journey or when he is ill, he must make it up later as the Honorable the Exalted God says, ‘But if any of you is ill, or on a journey, the prescribed number (should be made up) from days later.’"

جده عليهم السلام قال: لما كان من أمر أبي بكر وبيعة الناس له وفعلهم بعلي بن أبي طالب عليه السلام ما كان لم يزل أبوبكر يظهر له الانبساط ويرى منه انقباضا فكبر ذلك على أبي بكر فأحب لقاءه واستخراج ما عنده والمعذرة إليهلما اجتمع الناس عليه وتقليدهم إياه أمر الامة وقلة رغبته في ذلك وزهده فيه، أتاه في وقت غفلة وطلب منه الخلوة، وقال له: والله يا أبا الحسن ما كان هذا الامر مواطاة مني، ولا رغبة فيما وقعت فيه، ولا حرصا عليه ولا ثقة بنفسي في ما تحتاج إليه الامة ولا قوة لي لمال ولا كثرة العشيرة ولا ابتزاز له دون غيري فمالك تضمر علي ما لم أستحقه منك وتظهر لي الكراهة فيما صرت إليه وتنظر إلي بعين السأمة منيقال: فقال له عليه السلام: فما حملك عليه إذا لم ترغب فيه ولا حرصت لعيه ولا وثقت بنفسك في القيام به، وبما يحتاج منك فيه؟فقال أبوبكر: حديث سمعته من رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله ""إن الله لا يجمع امتي على ضلال."" ولما رأيت اجتماعهم اتبعت حديث النبي صلى الله عليه وآله وأحلت أن يكون اجتماعهم على خلاف الهدى وأعطيتهم قود الاجابة ولو علمت أن أحدا يتخلف لامتنعتقال: فقال علي عليه السلام: أما ما ذكرت من

بدوني في الابقاء عليهم وعلى أديانهمقال علي عليه السلام: أجل ولكن أخبرني عن الذي يستحق هذا الامر بما يستحقه؟فقال أبو بكر: بالنصيحة، والوفاء، ورفع المداهنة والمحاباة، وحسن السيرة، وإظهار العدل، والعلم بالكتاب والسنة وفصل الخطاب، مع الزهد في الدنيا وقلة الرغبة فيها وانصاف المظلوم من الظالم القريب والبعيد. ثم سكتفقال علي عليه السلام: أنشدك بالله يا أبا بكر أفي نفسك تجد هذه الخصال أم في؟قال: بل فيك يا

فعلم بالامر وقام ورجع إلى بيته","22-30 Ahmad ibn al-Hassan al-Qat’tan narrated that Abdul Rahman ibn Muhammad al-Hassani quoted Abu Ja’far Muhammad ibn Hafs al-Khas’ami, on the authority of Al-Hassan ibn Abdul Vahid, on the authority of Ahmad ibn al-Taqlabi, on the authority of Ahmad ibn Abdul Hameed, on the authority of Hafs ibn Mansoor al-At’tar, on the authority of Abu Sa’id al-Var’raq, on the authority of his father, on the authority of Ja’far ibn Muhammad as-Sadiq (MGB), on the authority of his father (MGB), on the authority of his grandfather (MGB), “When Abu Bakr became the Caliph and the people pledged allegiance to him and abandoned Ali (MGB), Abu Bakr treated Ali (MGB) pleasantly and with a smiling face, but Ali (MGB) did not show happiness. This was hard on Abu Bakr. Therefore, he wanted to visit Ali (MGB) in private, ask him the reason for this, apologize to him for the people having gathered around him and having delegated the task ofCaliphate for him. He wanted to tell Ali (MGB) that he had just obeyed them in accepting the rule over the nation, and that he was not that eager to do so. Thus, Abu Bakr went to see Ali (MGB) in private and said, ‘O Abal-Hassan! I swear by God that I had no plans for the Caliphate nor did I have any desires for it. I am not eager for that position and do not trust myself to be able to fulfill the needs of this nation. I have no wealth or power; do not have a supporter; and I did not want to get it from someone by force. Why are you upset with me? Why do you look upon me with disdain?’ Then Ali (MGB) told him, ‘If you had no desire for the position of Caliphate and you were not sure whether you could carry it out, then why did you accept the responsibility for being the Caliph?’Abu Bakr said, ‘The reason for this was a narration which I had heard from the Prophet (MGB) who said, ‘Indeed God would not let all my nation unite on an issue that opposes guidance’ I accepted the call of the nation. Had I known that there was someone who opposed me, I would not have accepted.’Ali (MGB) said, ‘You cited a narration from the Prophet (MGB) stating ‘Indeed God would not let all my nation unite on an issue that opposes guidance’. But wasn’t I one of the members of this nation or not?’Abu Bakr said, ‘Yes, you were.’Ali (MGB) added, ‘What about the others who opposed you such as Salman, Ammar, Abuzar, Al-Miqdad, Ibn Ebada and those of the Helpers (Ansar) who were with him?’Abu Bakr said, ‘Yes. They were all members of the nation.’Ali (MGB) said, ‘Then how could you rely on that narration from the Prophet (MGB) and the like, while you knew well that the people who opposed you were all of the great companions of the Prophet (MGB)? They are recognized by the nation and have never neglected in wishing well for the cause of the Prophet (MGB).’Abu Bakr said, ‘I did not know at the beginning that they are opposed to me. Later on, after I took charge of the affairs I realized that they are opposed to me. However, I feared that the people might turn back from the religion if I resign. I thought that it would be easier to change your mind and bring you in line with me, rather than have an outbreak of a civil war and some of the people return to atheism. I knew that you are not any less interested in protecting the Muslims and their religion than I am.’Ali (MGB) said, ‘Fine. Can you tell me what attributes should the person who is worthy of the position of Caliphate have?’Abu Bakr said, ‘He should be a well-wisher and loyal person, and he should not be unduly generous. He should be polite, just, knowledgeable of the Book, the traditions and the Divine Decrees. He should abstain from the world with little interest in it. He should take the rights of the oppressed from the oppressors, whether they be his relatives or strangers.’Then Abu Bakr remained silent.Then Ali (MGB) said, ‘O Abu Bakr! I swear to you by God! Do I possess these attributes or do you?’Abu Bakr said, ‘O Abal-Hassan (Ali)! Certainly you possess them.’Ali (MGB) said, ‘O Abu Bakr! I swear to you by God! Was it I who accepted the Prophet’s invitation to Islam before anyone else considered Islam or was it you who did this?’ Abu Bakr said, ‘Of course, it was you.’Ali (MGB) said, ‘I swear to you by God! Was it you who accepted God’s Prophet’s (MGB) call to Islam before any other men or was it you?’ Abu Bakr said, ‘Of course, it was you.’Ali (MGB) said, ‘I swear to you by God! Was it you who recited the Bara’at Chapter (Declaration of Immunity) for the pilgrims and the whole nation during the Hajj season, or was it you who did it?’ Abu Bakr said, ‘Of course, it was you.’Ali (MGB) said, ‘I swear to you by God! Was it I who sacrificed myself to protect the life of God’s Prophet (MGB) when he (MGB) took refuge in a cave, or was it you who did it?’ Abu Bakr said, ‘Of course, it was you.’Ali (MGB) said, ‘I swear to you by God! Was it I who is the subject of the following verse regarding giving my ring in charity ‘your real friends are (no less than) Allah, His Messenger, and the (fellowship of) believers,- those who establish regular prayers and regular charity, and they bow down humbly (in worship)’ or was it you?’ Abu Bakr said, ‘Of course, it was revealed regarding you.’Ali (MGB) said, ‘I swear to you by God! Am I the Master of you and all the Muslims according to what God’s Prophet (MGB) said on the Day of Qadir Khum, or you?’ Abu Bakr said, ‘Of course, you.’Ali (MGB) said, ‘I swear to you by God! Am I the Prophet’s vizier and do I have the same rank as Aaron had to Moses (MGB) in relation to the Prophet (MGB), or do you have it?’ Abu Bakr said, ‘Of course for you.’Ali (MGB) said, ‘I swear to you by God! Did the Prophet (MGB) take me, my family and my children out for the imprecation of the Christian unbelievers, or did he take you and your family out for the imprecation of the unbelievers?’ Abu Bakr said, ‘Of course, you.’Then, Ali (MGB) said, ‘I swear to you by God! Was the verse of purity from all abominations ‘…And God only wishes to remove all abomination from you, ye members of the Family, and to make you pure and spotless’ revealed for me, my family and children, or was it revealed for you and your family?’ Abu Bakr said, ‘Of course, it was revealed for you and the members of your family.’Then Ali (MGB) said, ‘O Abu Bakr! I swear to you by God! On the Kasa assembly day did the Prophet (MGB) supplicate for me, my family and my children and say, ‘O God! These are the members of my Family! Please keep them far away from the fire’ or did he supplicate for you?’ Abu Bakr said, ‘Of course the Prophet (MGB) supplicated for you, your family and children.’Then Ali (MGB) said, ‘O Abu Bakr! I swear to you by God! Does the following Quranic verse refer to me ‘They perform (their) vows, and they fear a Day whose evil flies far and wide’ or does it refer to you?’ Abu Bakr said, ‘Of course, it refers to you.’Then Ali (MGB) said, ‘O Abu Bakr! I swear to you by God! Are you the knight about whom the following was announced from the Heavens ‘There is no sword like Zulfaqar and there is no true knight but Ali’, or me?’ Abu Bakr said, ‘Of course, it refers to you.’Then Ali (MGB) said, ‘O Abu Bakr! I swear to you by God! Were you the person who missed his prayer so the sun was returned for you to pray, and then it set, or was it me?’ Abu Bakr said, ‘Of course, it was you.’Then Ali (MGB) said, ‘O Abu Bakr! I swear to you by God! Were you the person to whom God’s Prophet (MGB) handed his flag on the day of the Battle of the Trench and by whom God brought victory in that Battle, or was I that person?’ Abu Bakr said, ‘Of course, it was you.’Then Ali (MGB) said, ‘O Abu Bakr! I swear to you by God! Were you the person who relieved the Prophet’s sorrow by killing Amr ibn ‘Abd Wudd , or was I that person?’ Abu Bakr said, ‘Of course, it was you.’Then Ali (MGB) said, ‘O Abu Bakr! I swear to you by God! Were you the person whose leadership of the genies God’s Prophet (MGB) acknowledged and the genies accepted it, or was I that person?’ Abu Bakr said, ‘Of course, it was you.’Then Ali (MGB) said, ‘O Abu Bakr! I swear to you by God! Were you the person whose legitimacy the Prophet praised from Adam to his own father by saying ‘Your lineage and mine starting from Adam to Abdul Mutalib and are all the result of wedlock’, or was I that person?’ Abu Bakr said, ‘Of course, it was you.’Then Ali (MGB) said, ‘O Abu Bakr! I swear to you by God! Was I the person who was chosen by God’s Prophet (MGB) to whom he (MGB) married off his daughter Fatimah and said, ‘God married you off’, or was it you?’ Abu Bakr said, ‘Of course, you.’Then Ali (MGB) said, ‘O Abu Bakr! I swear to you by God! Am I the father of Al-Hassan and Al-Hussein who are the two sweet basils of the Prophet (MGB) about whom he (MGB) said, ‘These two are the Masters of the Youth in Paradise. Their father is better than them’, or are you?’ Abu Bakr said, ‘Of course, you.’Then Ali (MGB) said, ‘O Abu Bakr! I swear to you by God! Is the person who is adorned with two wings with which he flies in Paradise along with the other angels your brother or my brother?’ Abu Bakr said, ‘Of course he is your brother.’Then Ali (MGB) said, ‘O Abu Bakr! I swear to you by God! Was it I who pledged to pay off the Prophet’s obligations and declared that during the Hajj pilgrimage season or was it you?’ Abu Bakr said, ‘Of course, you.’Then Ali (MGB) said, ‘O Abu Bakr! I swear to you by God! Was I the person about whom God’s Prophet (MGB) prayed to ‘O my Lord! Please send me your most beloved creature to share this bird with me’ when he (MGB) wanted to eat a roasted bird, or was it you?’ Abu Bakr said, ‘Of course, it was you.’Then Ali (MGB) said, ‘O Abu Bakr! I swear to you by God! Was I the person about whom the Prophet (MGB) brought the good news of killing the perfidious party (Nakiseen), the deviators, and the apostates according to the interpretations of the Quran, or was it you?’ Abu Bakr said, ‘Of course, it was you.’Then Ali (MGB) said, ‘O Abu Bakr! I swear to you by God! Was it you who heard the last words of God’s Prophet (MGB), performed his ritual ablutions (wuzu) for the dead, and buried him (MGB) or was it me?’ Abu Bakr said, ‘Of course, you.’Ali (MGB) said, ‘I swear to you by God! Were you the person about whom God’s Prophet said, ‘Ali is the best of the judges amongst you’, or did that refer to me?’ Abu Bakr said, ‘Of course, you.’Then Ali (MGB) said, ‘O Abu Bakr! I swear to you by God! Was I the person about whom the Prophet (MGB) ordered his companions to call as the Commander of the Faithful during his own lifetime, or was it you?’ Abu Bakr said, ‘Of course, you.’Then Ali (MGB) said, ‘O Abu Bakr! I swear to you by God! Were you closer in ties of kinship to God’s Prophet (MGB), or was I?’ Abu Bakr said, ‘Of course, you.’Then Ali (MGB) said, ‘O Abu Bakr! I swear to you by God! Were you the person who gave a Dinar to the Prophet (MGB) when he (MGB) needed it and Gabriel pledged allegiance to you? Were you the one who kept the Prophet (MGB) and his family as guests, or was that me?’ Then Abu Bakr cried and said, ‘Of course, you.’Then Ali (MGB) said, ‘O Abu Bakr! I swear to you by God! Were you the person whom the Prophet (MGB) put on his shoulders to bring down and break the idols of the Ka’ba and could even extend his hands to the heavens if he willed, or was it me?’ Abu Bakr said, ‘Of course, you.’Then Ali (MGB) said, ‘O Abu Bakr! I swear to you by God! Were you the one about whom God’s Prophet (MGB) said, ‘You are the one to uphold my flag in this world and the Hereafter’, or was it me?’ Abu Bakr said, ‘Of course, you.’Then Ali (MGB) said, ‘O Abu Bakr! I swear to you by God! Were you the one whose door was left open from the mosque when all the other doors of the companions of family members of the Prophet were shut and the Prophet (MGB) allowed what God had allowed for him, or was it me?’ Abu Bakr said, ‘Of course, you.’Ali (MGB) said, ‘I swear to you by God! Was it you who gave charity before having a private consultation with God’s Prophet (MGB), or was it me? It was at that time that the Honorable the Exalted God blamed a group of people and revealed the following verse, ‘Is it that ye are afraid of spending sums in charity before your private consultation (with him)? If, then, ye do not so, and God forgives you, then (at least) establish regular prayer; practise regular charity; and obey Allah and His Messenger. And Allah is well-acquainted with all that ye do.’ ’ Abu Bakr said, ‘Of course, you.’Then Ali (MGB) said, ‘O Abu Bakr! I swear to you by God! Were you the person about whom God’s Prophet (MGB) explicitly referred to in what he (MGB) told Fatimah, ‘I married you off to the first person to have believed and his faith is the most superior of all’, or did that refer to me?’ Abu Bakr said, ‘Of course, you.’Then Ali (MGB) kept on mentioning the characteristics which the Honorable the Exalted God had given to him and no one else and Abu Bakr kept on saying, ‘Of course, you.’Abu Bakr said, ‘That is right. Such are the required characteristics for one to be in charge of the affairs of the nation of Muhammad (MGB)!’Then Ali (MGB) told him, ‘Then what fooled you so much that you turned away from God, His Prophet (MGB) and His religion? You lack what those who abide by His religion need.’Then Abu Bakr cried and said, ‘O Abal-Hassan!. You are right. Give me today to think about my affairs and what you said.’ Then Ali (MGB) told him, ‘O Abu Bakr! Fine. Do as you wish.’Then Abu Bakr left Ali’s presence. He went home and closed the doors upon himself and did not let anyone come in until night time. Umar kept walking amongst the people, since he had heard that Abu Bakr and Ali had held a private meeting.When Abu Bakr slept he dreamed of the Prophet (MGB) who was sitting in his own place. Abu Bakr rushed to the Prophet (MGB) to greet him, but the Prophet (MGB) turned his face away from him. Abu Bakr asked, ‘O Prophet of God! Have you issued any orders which I have not followed?’ God’s Prophet (MGB) replied, ‘You want me to greet you back even though you act against God and His Prophet? And even though you act against the one who is the friend of God and His Prophet? Return the right to its possessor!’ Abu Bakr asked, ‘Who is its possessor?’ The Prophet (MGB) answered, ‘It is the same person who blamed you. It is Ali.’ Abu Bakr said, ‘O Prophet of God! I shall entrust the Caliphate to him according to your orders.’Then when the morning came Abu Bakr cried and told Ali (MGB), ‘Give me your hand.’ Then Abu Bakr pledged allegiance to him and entrusted the Caliphate to him and told him (MGB), ‘I shall go to the Prophet’s mosque, inform the people about the dream I had last night and tell them what was exchanged between me and the Prophet (MGB) in my dream. I shall resign from the position of the Caliphate in the presence of the people and submit the affairs to you.’ Then Ali (MGB) told him, ‘Fine.’Abu Bakr left while he was pale and ran into Umar who was looking for him. Umar told him, ‘O Caliph of God’s Prophet! How are you?’ Then Abu Bakr informed him of what had been exchanged between him and Ali (MGB). Then Umar said, ‘O Caliph of God’s Prophet (MGB)! I swear to you by God not to be deceived by the Hashemites witchcraft! This is not the first time which they have used witchcraft.’ Umar kept tempting him until he changed his mind, gave up his decision, and became inclined to rule. Umar forced him to return and keep his previous position. When Ali (MGB) went to the mosque at the appointed time he (MGB) did not see either one of them and realized their wicked plans. Then he (MGB) went and sat at the grave of God’s Prophet (MGB). Umar passed by and said, ‘O Ali! You will never get what you want.’ Thus, Ali (MGB) realized what he had done. He (MGB) got up and returned home.”"

قال: حدثنا محمد بن الحسين بن أبي الخطاب، عن الحكم بن مسكين الثقفي، عن أبي الجارود وهشام أبي ساسان، وأبي طارق السراج، عن عامر بن واثلة قال: كنت في البيت يوم الشورى فسمعت عليا عليه السلام وهو يقول: استخلف الناس أبا بكر وأنا والله أحق بالامر وأولى به منه، واستخلف أبو بكر عمر وأنا والله أحق بالامر وأولى به منه، إلا أن عمر جعلني مع خمسة نفر أنا سادسهم لا يعرف لهم علي فضل ولو أشاء لاحتججت عليهم بما لا يستطيع عربيهم ولا عجميهم المعاهد منهم والمشرك تغيير ذلك ثم قال: نشدتكم بالله أيها النفر هل فيكم أحد وحد الله قبلي؟ قالوا: اللهم لا قال: نشدتكم بالله هل فيكم أحد قال له رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله: "" أنت مني بمنزلة هارون من موسى إلا أنه لا نبي بعدي"" غيري؟ قالوا: اللهم لا قال: نشدتكم بالله هل فيكم أحد ساق رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله لرب العالمين هديا فأشركه فيه غيري قالوا: اللهم لا قال: نشدتكم بالله هل فيكم أحد اتي رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله بطير يأكل منه، فقال: "" اللهم ائتني بأحب خلقك إليك يأكل معي من هذا الطير "" فجئته أنا، غيري؟ قالوا: اللهم لا قال: نشدتكم بالله هل فيكم أحد قال له رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله حين رجع عمر يجبن أصحابه ويحبنونه قد رد راية رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله منهزما فقال له رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله: ""لأعطين الراية غدا رجلا ليس بفرار يحبه قال: نشدتكم بالله هل فيكم أحد له أخ مثل أخي جعفر المزين بالجناحين في الجنة يحل فيها حيث يشاء غيري؟ قالوا: اللهم لا قال: نشدتكم بالله هل فيكم أحد له عم مثل عمي حمزة أسد الله وأسد رسوله وسيد الشهداء غيري؟ قالوا:

نكون ممن يبغضه ويعاديه. فقال صلى الله عليه وآله: ""اسكتي إن كنت أنت وأبوك ممن يتولاه ويحبه فقد سبقت لكما الرحمة، وإن كنتما ممن يبغضه ويعاديه فقد سبقت لكما اللعنة، ولقد جئت أنت وأبوك إن كان أبوك أول من يظلمه وأنت أول من يقاتله"" غيري؟ قالوا: اللهم لا قال: نشدتكم بالله هل فيكم أحد قال له رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله مثل ما قال لي: ""يا علي أنت أخي وأنا أخوك في الدنيا والآخرة، ومنزلك مواجه منزلي كما يتواجه الاخوان في الخلد""؟ قالوا: اللهم لا قال: نشدتكم بالله هل فيكم أحد قال له رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله: ""يا علي إن الله خصك بأمر وأعطاكه، ليس من الاعمال شيء أحب إليه ولا أفضل منه عنده: الزهد في الدنيا فليس تنال منها شيئا ولا تناله منك، وهي زينة الابرار عند الله عز وجل يوم القيامة فطوبى لمن أحبك وصدق عليك وويل لمن أبغضك وكذب عليك"" غيري؟ قالوا: اللهم لا قال نشدتكم بالله هل فيكم أحد بعثه رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله ليجيء بالماء كما بعثني فذهبت حتى حملت القربة على ظهري ومشيت بها فاستقبلتني ريح فردتنى حتى أجلستني. ثم قمت فاستقبلتني ريح فردتني حتى أجلستني. ثم قمت فجئت إلى رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله، فقال لي: ما حبسك عني؟ فقصصت عليه القصة. فقال: قد جاءني جبرئيل فأخبرني: أما الريح الاولى فجبرئيل كان في ألف من الملائكة يسلمون عليك، وأما الثانية فميكائيل جاء في ألف من الملائكة يسلمون عليك"" غيري؟ قالوا: اللهم لا قال: نشدتكم بالله هل فيكم من قال له جبرئيل: ""يا محمد أترى هذا المواساة من علي؟ فقال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله: إنه مني وأنا منه. فقال جبرئيل: وأنا منكما"" غيري؟ قالوا: اللهم لا قال: نشدتكم بالله هل فيكم أحد كان يكتب لرسول الله كما جعلت أكتب فأغفى رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله فأنا أرى أنه يملي علي فلما انتبه قال له: ""يا علي من أملى عليك من ههنا إلى ههنا؟ فقلت: أنت يا رسول الله. فقال: لا ولكن جبرئيل أملاه عليك"" غيري؟ قالوا: اللهم لا قال: نشدتكم بالله هل فيكم أحد نادى له مناد من السماء: ""لا سيف إلا ذو الفقار ولا فتي إلا علي"" غيري؟ قالوا: اللهم لا قال: نشدتكم بالله هل فيكم أحد قال له رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم كما قال لي: ""لولا أن أخاف أن لا يبقى أحد إلا قبض من أثرك قبضة يطلب بها البركة لعقبه من بعده لقلت فيك قولا لا يبقى أحد إلا قبض من أثرك قبضة"" غيري؟ فقالوا: اللهم لا قال: نشدتكم بالله هل فيكم أحد قال له رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله: ""احفظ الباب فإن زوارا من الملائكة يزوروني فلا تأذن لاحد منهم."" فجاء عمر فرددته ثلاث مرات وأخبرته أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله محتجب وعنده زوار من الملائكة وعدتهم كذا وكذا، ثم أذنت له. فدخل فقال: يا رسول الله إني قد جئتك غير مرة كل ذلك يردني علي ويقول: إن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله محتجب وعنده زوار من الملائكة وعدتهم كذا وكذا. فكيف علم بالعدة أعاينهم؟ فقال لـه : يا علي قد صدق. كيف علمت بعدتهم؟ فقلت: اختلفت علي التحيات وسمعت الاصوات فأحصيت العدد. قال: صدقت فإن فيك سنة من أخي عيسى. فخرج عمر وهو يقول: ضربه لابن مريم مثلا. فأنزل الله عز وجل: وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلًا إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ.

فقال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله: ""ما منعتكما وزوجته، بل الله منعكما وزوجه"" غيري؟ قالوا: اللهم لا قال: نشدتكم بالله هل سمعتم رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله يقول: ""كل سبب ونسب منقطع يوم القيامة إلا سببي ونسبي"" فاي سبب أفضل من سببي وأي نسب أفضل من نسبي؟ إن أبي وأبا رسول الله لاخوان وإن الحسن والحسين ابني رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله وسيدي شباب أهل الجنة ابناي، وفاطمة بنت رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله زوجتي سيدة نساء أهل الجنة، غيري؟ قالوا: اللهم لا قال: نشدتكم بالله هل فيكم أحد قال له رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله: ""إن الله خلق الخلق ففرقهم فرقتين فجعلني من خير الفرقتين،، ثم جعلهم شعوبا فجعلني في خير شعبه، ثم جعلهم قبائل فجعلني في خير قبيلة، ثم جعلهم بيوتا فجعلني في خير بيت، ثم اختار من أهل بيتي أنا وعليا وجعفر فجعلني خيرهم، فكنت نائما بين ابني أبي طالب فجاء جبرئيل ومعه ملك فقال: يا جبرئيل إلى أي هؤلاء ارسلت؟ فقال: إلى هذا. ثم أخذ بيدي فأجلسني. غيري؟ قالوا: اللهم لا قال: نشدتكم بالله هل فيكم أحد سد رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله أبواب المسلمين كلهم في المسجد ولم يسد بابي فجاءه العباس وحمزة وقالا: أخرجتنا وأسكنته؟ فقال لهما: ""ما أنا أخرجتكم وأسكنته، بل الله أخرجكم وأسكنه إن الله عز وجل أوحى إلى أخي موسى عليه السلام أن اتخذ مسجدا طهورا وأسكنه أنت وهارون وابنا هارون وإن الله عز وجل أوحى إلي أن اتخذ مسجدا طهورا وأسكنه أنت وعلي وابنا علي"" غيري؟ فقالوا: اللهم لا قال: نشدتكم بالله هل فيكم أحد قال له رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله: ""الحق مع علي وعلي مع الحق لا يفترقان حتى يردا علي الحوض"" غيري؟ قالوا: اللهم لا قال: نشدتكم بالله هل فيكم أحد وقى رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله حيث جاء المشركون يريدون قتله فاضطجعت في مضجعه وذهب رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله نحو الغار وهم يرون أني أنا هو فقالوا: أين ابن عمك؟ فقلت: لا أدري فضربوني حتى كادوا يقتلونني، غيري؟ قالوا: اللهم لا قال: نشدتكم بالله هل فيكم أحد قال له رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله كما قال لي ""إن الله أمرني بولاية علي فولايته ولايتي وولايتي ولاية ربي، عهد عهده إلي ربي وأمرني أن ابلغكموه فهل سمعتم؟ قالوا: نعم قد سمعنا. قال: أما إن فيكم من يقول: قد سمعت وهو يحمل الناس على كتفيه ويعاديه. قالوا: يا رسول الله، أخبرنا بهم. قال: أما إن ربي قد أخبرني بهم وأمرني بالاعراض عنهم لامر قد سبق وإنما يكتفي أحدكم بما يجد لعلي في قلبه"" غيري؟ قالوا: اللهم لا قال: نشدتكم بالله هل فيكم أحد قتل من بني عبدالدار تسعة مبارزة غيري، كلهم يأخذ اللواء ثم جاء صؤاب الحبشي مولاهم، وهو يقول: والله لا أقتل بسادتي إلا محمدا قد ازبد شدقاه واحمرتا عيناه فاتقيتموه وحدتم عنه وخرجت إليه فلما أقبل كأنه قبة مبنية، فاختلفت أنا وهو ضربتين فقطعته بنصفين وبقيت رجلاه وعجزه وفخذه قائمة على الارض ينظر إليه المسلمون ويضحكون منه، غيري؟ قالوا: اللهم لا قال: نشدتكم بالله هل فيكم أحد قتل من مشركي قريش مثل قتلي؟ قالوا: اللهم لا قال نشدتكم بالله هل فيكم أحد جاء عمرو بن عبدود ينادي هل من مبارز، فكعتم عنه كلكم فقمت أنا فقال لي رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله: إلى أين تذهب، فقلت: أقوم إلى هذا الفاسق. فقال: إنه عمرو بن عبد ود. فقلت: يا رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله إن كان هو عمرو بن عبد ود فأنا علي بن أبي طالب. فأعاد علي عليه السلام الكلام، وأعدت عليه. فقال: إمض على اسم الله، فلما قربت منه قال: من الرجل؟ قلت: علي بن أبي طالب. قال: كفو كريم! ارجع يا ابن أخي فقد كان لأبيك معي صحبة ومحادثة فأنا أكره قتلك. فقلت له: يا عمرو، إنك قد عاهدت الله ألا يخيرك أحد ثلاث خصال إلا اخترت إحداهن. فقال: اعرض علي. قلت: تشهد أن لا إله إلا الله وأن محمدا رسول الله وتقر بما جاء من عند الله. قال: هات غير هذه. قلت: ترجع من حيث جئت. قال: والله لا تحدث نساء قريش بهذا أني رجعت عنك. فقلت: فأنزل فاقاتلك. قال: أما هذه فنعم. فنزل فاختلفت أنا وهو ضربتين فأصاب الحجفة وأصاب السيف رأسي وضربته ضربة فانكشف رجليه فقتله الله على يدي. ففيكم أحد فعل هذا [غيري]؟ قالوا: اللهم لا قال: نشدتكم بالله هل فيكم أحد حين جاء مرحب وهو يقول: أنا الذي سمتني امي مرحب، شاك السلاح بطل مجرب، أطعن أحيانا وحينا أضرب. فخرجت إليه فضربني وضربته وعلى رأسه نقير من جبل لم تكن تصلح على رأسه بيضة من عظم رأسه. فقلبت النقير ووصل السيف إلى رأسه فقتلته، ففيكم أحد فعل هذا؟ قالوا: اللهم لا قال: نشدتكم بالله هل فيكم أحد أنزل الله فيه آية التطهير على رسوله صلى الله عليه وآله ""إِنَّمَا يُرِيدُ اللهُ لِيُذْهِبَ عَنْكُمُ الرِّجْسَ أَهْلَ الْبَيْتِ وَيُطَهِّرَكُمْ تَطْهِيراً ."" فأخذ رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله كساء خيبريا فضمني فيه وفاطمة عليها السلام والحسن والحسين ثم قال: ""يا رب هؤلاء أهل بيتي فأذهب عنهم الرجس وطهرهم تطهيرا""؟ قالوا: اللهم لا قال: نشدتكم بالله هل فيكم أحد قال له رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله: ""أنا سيد ولد آدم وأنت يا علي سيد العرب""؟ قالوا: اللهم لا قال: نشدتكم بالله هل فيكم أحد كان رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله في المسجد إذ نظر إلى شيء ينزل من السماء فبادره ولحقه أصحابه فانتهى إلى سودان أربعة يحملون سريرا، فقال لهم: ضعوا فوضعوا فقال: اكشفوا عنه فكشفوا فإذا أسود مطوق بالحديد فقال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله: من هذا؟ قالوا: غلام للرياحيين كان قد أبق عنهم خبثا وفسقا فأمرونا أن ندفنه في حديده كما هو فنظرت إليه، فقلت: يا رسول الله ما رآني قط إلا قال: ""أنا والله احبك والله ما أحبك إلا مؤمن ولا أبغضك إلا كافر."" فقال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله: ""يا علي لقد أثابه الله بذا، هذا سبعون قبيلا من الملائكة كل قبيل على ألف قبيل قد نزلوا يصلون عليه. ففك رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله حديدته وصلى عليه ودفنه؟ قالوا: اللهم لا قال: نشدتكم بالله هل فيكم أحد قال له رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله مثل ما قال لي: ""اذن لي البارحة في الدعاء فما سألت ربي شيئا إلا أعطانيه، وما سألت لنفسي شيئا إلا سألت لك مثله وأعطانيه"" فقلت: الحمد لله؟ قالوا: اللهم لا قال: نشدتكم بالله هل علمتم أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله بعث خالد بن الوليـد إلى بنـي جذيـمة ففعل ما فعل فصعد رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله المنبر فقال: ""اللهم إني أبرأ إليك مما صنع خالد بن الوليد، ثلاث مرات. ثم قال: اذهب يا علي. فذهبت فوديتهم ثم ناشدتهم بالله هل بقي شيء؟ فقالوا: إذ نشدتنا بالله فميلغة كلابنا وعقال بعيرنا. فأعطيتهم لهما وبقي معي ذهب كثير فأعطيتهم إياه وقلت: هذا لذمة رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله ولما تعلمون ولما لا تعلمون ولروعات النساء والصبيان. ثم جئت إلى رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله فأخبرته، فقال: والله ما يسرني يا علي أن لي بما صنعت حمر النعم؟ قالوا: اللهم نعم قال: نشدتكم بالله هل سمعتم رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله يقول: ""يا علي، لقد عرضت علي امتي البارحة فمر بي أصحاب الرايات فاستغفرت لك ولشيعتك""؟ فقالوا: اللهم نعم قال: نشدتكم بالله هل سمعتم رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله قال: يا أبا بكر، إذهب فاضرب عنق ذلك الرجل الذي تجده في موضع كذا وكذا. فرجع، فقال: قتلته؟ قال: لا، وجدته يصلي. قال: يا عمر، اذهب فاقتله. فرجع، فقال: قتلته؟ قال: لا، وجدته يصلي. فقال: آمركما بقتله فتقولان وجدناه يصلي؟! قال: يا علي، اذهب فاقتله. فلما مضيت قال: إن أدركه قتله. فرجعت فقلت: يا رسول الله لم أجد أحدا. فقال: صدقت، أما إنك لو وجدته لقتلته؟ قالوا: اللهم نعم قال: نشدتكم بالله هل فيكم أحد قال له رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله كما قال لي: ""إن وليك في الجنة وعدوك في النار""؟ قالوا: اللهم لا قال: نشدتكم بالله هل علمتم أن عائشة قالت لرسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله: إن إبراهيم ليس منك وإنه ابن فلان القبطي. قال: يا علي، اذهب فاقتله، فقلت: يا رسول الله إذا بعثتني أكون كالمسمار المحمى في الوبر أو أتثبت؟ قال: لا، بل تثبت. فذهبت فلما نظر إلي استند إلى حائط فطرح نفسه فيه فطرحت نفسي على أثره، فصعد على نخل وصعدت خلفه. فلما رآني قد صعدت رمى بإزاره، فإذا ليس له شيء مما يكون للرجال. فجئت فأخبرت رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله. فقال: الحمد لله الذي صرف عنا السوء أهل البيت؟ فقالوا: اللهم نعم فقال: اللهم اشهد","22-31 (The compiler of the book narrated) that his father and Muhammad ibn al-Hassan ibn Ahmad ibn al-Walid - may God be pleased with them - narrated that Sa’ed ibn Abdullah quoted Muhammad ibn al-Hussein ibn Abil-Khat’tab, on the authority of Al-Hikam ibn Meskin al-Thaqafi, on the authority of Abil Jarud, Hisham Abi Sasan and Abi Tariq al-Suraj, on the authority of Amir ibn Wathila (Abul Tufayl) “On the day on which the (Caliphate) council was set up, I was in the house in which the six-member council held a gathering. I heard Ali say, ‘The people established Abu Bakr as the Caliph while by God it was my right to be in charge of the affairs and I was more deserving for that position than he was. Moreover, Abu Bakr put Umar in charge of the Caliph while by God it was my right to be in charge of the affairs and I was more deserving for that position than Umar was. Now Umar has placed me as the sixth member of a six-member council without recognizing my nobility over them. If needed, I can bring arguments for them which the Arabs, the non-Arabs, the ones who have pledged, and the atheists cannot deny and I can change everything around with them.’ Then Ali added, ‘I swear to you by God! Is there anyone amongst you who has accepted the Unity of God before me?’ They replied, ‘By God; no. It was you.’ Then Ali said, ‘I swear to you by God! Is there anyone amongst you about whom God’s Prophet (MGB) has said, ‘Your relationship to me is like that of Aaron’s relationship to Moses (MGB) except that there will be no Prophets after me’ other than me?’ They replied, ‘By God; no. It was you.’ Then Ali said, ‘I swear to you by God! Is there anyone amongst you with whom God’s Prophet (MGB) has shared his offering for the Lord of the Two Worlds other than me?’ They replied, ‘By God; no. It was you.’ Then Ali said, ‘I swear to you by God! Is there anyone amongst you to have gone to the Prophet when upon receiving a roasted bird God’s Prophet (MGB) prayed to ‘O my Lord! Please send me your most beloved creature to share this bird with me’, other than me?’ They replied, ‘By God; no. It was you.’ Then Ali said, ‘I swear to you by God! Is there anyone amongst you about whom God’s Prophet (MGB) said the following when Umar returned from Fort Khaybar and his companions called him a coward and he called his companions cowards, since he had been defeated there, ‘Tomorrow I shall give this flag to one who is not going to flee, whom God and God’s Prophet love, and he loves God and God’s Prophet. He shall not return until by God’s help he conquers the Fort.’ Indeed the next morning he (MGB) said, ‘Bring Ali to me.’ They told him (MGB), ‘O Prophet of God! His eyes hurt so much that he cannot even wink.’ The Prophet ﷺ said, ‘Bring him to me.’ When I went to see God’s Prophet (MGB), he spit his blessed saliva into my eyes and said, ‘O God! Please cool its heat and heat its coolness.’ I swear by God that I have not had any more pains in my eyes since then. I took the flag, and God defeated the atheists. Was that me, or someone other than me?’ They replied, ‘By God; no. It was you.’ Then Ali said, ‘I swear to you by God! Is there anyone amongst you who has a brother like my brother Ja’far who is adorned with two wings in Paradise with which he can go anywhere he wishes to?’ They replied, ‘By God; no.’ Then Ali said, ‘I swear to you by God! Is there anyone amongst you who has an uncle like my uncle Hamzih who is the Lion of God and God’s Prophet, and the Master of the Martyrs?’ They replied, ‘By God; no.’ Then Ali said, ‘I swear to you by God! Is there anyone amongst you who has offspring like mine being Al-Hassan and Al-Hussein who are the (grand)children of God’s Prophet (MGB) and the Masters of the Youth in Paradise?’ They replied, ‘By God; no.’ Then Ali said, ‘I swear to you by God! Is there anyone amongst you who has a wife like mine being Fatimah - the daughter of God’s Prophet (MGB) who is a piece of the Prophet’s own flesh and blood, and the Master of the Ladies in Paradise?’ They replied, ‘By God; no.’ Then Ali said, ‘I swear to you by God! Is there anyone amongst you about whom God’s Prophet (MGB) said, ‘Whoever abandons you will abandon me. Whoever abandons me has indeed abandoned God’, other than me?’ They replied, ‘By God; no.’ Then Ali said, ‘I swear to you by God! Is there anyone amongst you about whom God’s Prophet (MGB) said, ‘The Walia clan must stop, else I shall dispatch a man towards them who is just like me myself. Obeying him is like obeying me and disobeying him is like disobeying me. He shall kill them with the sword!’, other than me?’ They replied, ‘By God; no.’ Then Ali said, ‘I swear to you by God! Is there anyone amongst you about whom God’s Prophet (MGB) said, ‘If my love touches the heart of any Muslim, all his sins shall be wiped out by God. Whoever loves me also loves you. Whoever thinks that he loves me, but dislikes you is telling a lie’, other than me?’ They replied, ‘By God; no.’ Then Ali said, ‘I swear to you by God! Is there anyone amongst you about whom God’s Prophet (MGB) said, ‘You are my Caliph reigning over my family, children and all the Muslims in my absence. Your enemy is my enemy and my enemy is indeed God’s enemy. Your friend is my friend and my friend is God’s friend’, other than me?’ They replied, ‘By God; no.’ Then Ali said, ‘I swear to you by God! Is there anyone amongst you about whom God’s Prophet (MGB) said, ‘O Ali! Mercy shall overtake whomever loves you and becomes your friend. Damnation shall overtake whomever despises you and becomes your enemy’, other than me?’ On that occasion Ayesha said, ‘O Prophet of God! Would you please pray for my father and I not to be amongst those who dislike him and are his enemies?’ Then The Prophet ﷺ said, ‘Be quiet! If you and your father be amongst those who love him and are his friends, then mercy shall overtake you. However, if you and your father be amongst those who despise him and are his enemy, then damnation shall overtake you. Indeed you and your father are wicked. Your father shall be the first one to usurp his rights and oppress him and you shall be the first one to fight him.’ They replied, ‘By God; no.’ Then Ali said, ‘I swear to you by God! Is there anyone amongst you about whom God’s Prophet (MGB) said, ‘O Ali! You are my brother and I am your brother in this world and in the Hereafter. Your house and my house will be facing each other in Paradise just like two brothers’ houses are’, other than me?’ They replied, ‘By God; no.’ Then Ali said, ‘I swear to you by God! ! Is there anyone amongst you other than me about whom God’s Prophet (MGB) said, ‘O Ali! Indeed God has allocated something to you and has honored you with something. No deed is more loved by God than abstinence in this world. You shall not gain anything in this world. Nothing in this world can get a hold of you either. Abstinence shall be the adornment of the good-doers near the Honorable the Exalted God on the Resurrection Day. Then blessed be the ones who love and acknowledge you. Woe be to the ones who despise and deny you.’ They replied, ‘By God; no.’ Then Ali said, ‘I swear to you by God! Is there anyone amongst you whom God’s Prophet (MGB) sent after water other than me? I went, filled up the water container, and put it on my back to carry it back. On the way back a wind started to blow forcing me to turn back and sit down. Then I stood up. Again a wind started to blow forcing me to turn back and sit down. Then I stood up again. Another wind started to blow forcing me to turn back and sit down. Then I stood up and went to The Prophet ﷺ and told him (MGB) what had happened. The Prophet ﷺ said, ‘Gabriel informed me about this. The first wind was Gabriel accompanied by one-thousand angels who greeted you. The second wind was Michael accompanied by one-thousand angels who greeted you. The third wind was Isra’fil accompanied by one-thousand angels who greeted you.’ They replied, ‘By God; no.’ Then Ali said, ‘I swear to you by God! Is there anyone amongst you other than me about whom Gabriel said, ‘O Muhammad! Do you see how Ali cooperates?’ Then The Prophet ﷺ said, ‘He is from me and I am from him.’ Then Gabriel added, ‘And I am from you.’’ They replied, ‘By God; no.’ Then Ali said, ‘I swear to you by God! Is there anyone amongst you who has the following honor other than me? Once when I was recording down something for the Prophet of God (MGB), The Prophet ﷺ closed his eyes. I thought that he was telling me things and I kept taking them down. However, when The Prophet ﷺ woke up, he (MGB) asked me, ‘O Ali! Who dictated things for you up until this point?’ I said, ‘O Prophet of God! It was you who dictated it to me.’ The Prophet ﷺ said, ‘No. It was Gabriel who dictated it to you.’ They replied, ‘By God; no.’ Then Ali said, ‘I swear to you by God! Is there anyone amongst you about whom the caller from the Heavens has announced, ‘There is no sword like Zulfaqar and there is no true knight but Ali’, other than me? They replied, ‘By God; no.’ Then Ali said, ‘I swear to you by God! Is there anyone amongst you about whom God’s Prophet (MGB) said, ‘If I were not afraid that the people would start to pick up the dirt under your feet and save it for their progeny I would have said something about you and then everyone would pick some dirt up from under your footsteps’ other than me?’ They replied, ‘By God; no.’ Then Ali said, ‘I swear to you by God! Is there anyone amongst you other than me about whom God’s Prophet (MGB) said, ‘Protect my house and do not let anyone come to me since the angels come to visit me.’ Then Umar came three times and I returned him telling him that the angels which are so many in number are visiting God’s Prophet (MGB). Then I granted him permission to enter. Once he saw The Prophet ﷺ he told him, ‘O Prophet of God! I came to visit you several times, but Ali did not let me in and said that you are having so many angels visit you. How could Ali see the angels and how did he know how many of them there were?’ Then The Prophet ﷺ faced me and asked, ‘O Ali! He is right! How did you know how many angels there were here?’ I replied, ‘I heard their various sounds and counted their number based on their sound.’ Then The Prophet ﷺ said, ‘You are right! You have one of the traditions of my brother Jesus (MGB).’ Then Umar left while he was repeatedly saying, ‘The Prophet ﷺ considered him to be similar to the son of Mary (Jesus (MGB)).’ Then the Honorable the Exalted God revealed the following verses, ‘When (Jesus) the son of Mary is held up as an example, behold, thy people raise a clamor thereat (in ridicule)!And they say, ‘Are our gods best, or he?’ This they set forth to thee, only by way of disputation, yea, they are a contentious people. He was no more than a servant, We granted Our favor to him, and We made him an example to the Children of Israel. And if it were Our Will, We could make angels from amongst you, succeeding each other on the Earth.’ ’ They replied, ‘By God; no.’ Then Ali said, ‘I swear to you by God! Is there anyone amongst you about whom God’s Prophet (MGB) said, Tooba is the name of a Heavenly tree which is rooted in Ali’s house. There are branches of this tree in the homes of all the believers’ other than me?’ They replied, ‘By God; no.’ Then Ali said, ‘I swear to you by God! Is there anyone amongst you about whom God’s Prophet (MGB) said, ‘You fight according to my tradition and compensate for my obligations’, other than me?’ They replied, ‘By God; no.’ Then Ali said, ‘I swear to you by God! Is there anyone amongst you to whom God’s Prophet (MGB) said, ‘You will fight the perfidious party, the deviators, and the apostates ’ other than me?’ They replied, ‘By God; no.’ Then Ali said, ‘I swear to you by God! Is there anyone amongst you who has gone to God’s Prophet (MGB) when the Prophet’s head was on Gabriel’s lap about whom Gabriel told The Prophet ﷺ, ‘Go to you cousin since he is closer to you than I am’ other than me?’ They replied, ‘By God; no.’ Then Ali said, ‘I swear to you by God! Is there anyone amongst you who has had the opportunity of holding the Prophet’s head on his lap (while The Prophet ﷺ was asleep) and not said the afternoon prayers until sunset. Then when The Prophet ﷺ woke up and asked, ‘O Ali! Did you say the afternoon prayer?’ and I replied, ‘No’ The Prophet ﷺ prayed and then the light of the sun returned allowing me to say my prayer and then it set other than me?’ They replied, ‘By God; no.’ Then Ali said, ‘I swear to you by God! Is there anyone amongst you with the following honor. When God’s Prophet (MGB) sent the Bara’at Chapter (Declaration of Immunity) with Abu Bakr, the Honorable the Exalted God sent Gabriel and said, ‘O Muhammad! No one but either you or someone who is from your own family should propagate this chapter.’ Then God’s Prophet (MGB) sent me to take it from Abu Bakr. I went, took it from Abu Bakr and propagated it. God has considered me to be of the Prophet’s family. Has anyone else amongst you attained this nobility other than me?’ They replied, ‘By God; no.’ Then Ali said, ‘I swear to you by God! Is there anyone amongst you about whom God’s Prophet (MGB) said, ‘You are the Divine Leader of whomever obeys me. You are the source of light for my friends. You are the word to which the pious ones are accustomed’, other than me?’ They replied, ‘By God; no.’ Then Ali said, ‘I swear to you by God! Is there anyone amongst you about whom God’s Prophet (MGB) said, ‘Whoever likes to live as I live, die as I die, reside in Paradise which my Lord has promised - the Paradise in which God has planted the trees with His own Hands - should love Ali ibn Abi Talib (MGB) and his progeny who shall be the Divine Leaders and the Trustees to whom God grants my knowledge and understanding. They shall not let you enter the gates of loss and shall not let you leave the gates of guidance. You should not try to teach them their duties since they will be more knowledgeable than you are. The truth shall be wherever they are’, other than me?’ They replied, ‘By God; no.’ Then Ali said, ‘I swear to you by God! Is there anyone amongst you about whom God’s Prophet (MGB) said, ‘It has been decreed and recorded that no one but believers shall love you and no one but atheists shall detest you’ other than me?’ They replied, ‘By God; no.’ Then Ali said, ‘I swear to you by God! Is there anyone amongst you about whom God’s Prophet (MGB) said something similar to what he (MGB) said about me, ‘On the Resurrection Day, those who are your friends shall rise up from their graves and ride white camels with the fasteners of their saddles being bright lights, and the roads will be paved for them. All difficulties will be eased for them. They shall be granted immunity. They will have no sorrow until they reach the Threshold of the Merciful. A table shall be spread out in front of them from which they can eat until the Reckoning ends. The people shall be frightened while they will not. The people shall be sad while they will not.’’ They replied, ‘By God; no.’ Then Ali said, ‘I swear to you by God! Is there anyone amongst you who has the honor of being married to Fatimah the way I was? As you know when Abu Bakr went to ask The Prophet ﷺ to allow him to marry Fatimah (MGB), The Prophet ﷺ turned him down. Also when Umar went to ask The Prophet ﷺ to allow him to marry Fatimah (MGB), The Prophet ﷺ turned him down. Then when I asked The Prophet ﷺ to allow me to marry Fatimah (MGB), The Prophet ﷺ married her off to me. Then both Abu Bakr and Umar went to see The Prophet ﷺ And said, ‘You did not marry her off to us, but you married her off to him!’ The Prophet ﷺ replied, ‘I did not turn you down and I did not marry her off to Ali. It was God who turned both of you down and married her off to Ali.’ They replied, ‘By God; no.’ Then Ali said, ‘I swear to you by God! Have you heard God’s Prophet (MGB) say, ‘All ties of kinship and nationality will be cut off on the Resurrection Day except for ties of kinship with me and my nation.’ Which ties are better than mine and which nationality is better than mine? My father and the Prophet’s father were brothers. My two (grand)sons of the Prophet Al-Hassan (MGB) and Al-Hussein (MGB) (the Masters of the Youth in Paradise) are my sons. Fatimah (MGB) who is the daughter of God’s Prophet (MGB) and the Master of the Ladies in Paradise is my wife. Is there anyone amongst who with a better nationality and ties of kinship than me?’ They replied, ‘By God; no.’ Then Ali said, ‘I swear to you by God! Is there anyone amongst you other than me about whom God’s Prophet (MGB) said, ‘Indeed God created the people and has divided them up into two groups. He has placed me in the better of the two groups. Then God divided up the people into several branches and placed me in the best branch. Then He divided them up into many tribes and placed me in the best tribe. Then He divided them up into many families and placed me in the best family. Then God chose me and He chose Ali and Ja’far from my family and made me the best of the three. I was sleeping between the two sons of Abi Talib (i.e. Ali and Ja’far) when Gabriel came along with an angel. The angel asked Gabriel, ‘To which of the three have you been sent?’ Gabriel replied, ‘To that one.’ Then Gabriel took my hand and had me sit down.’’ They replied, ‘By God; no.’ Then Ali said, ‘I swear to you by God! Is there anyone amongst you other than me whose door (of his house) was left open from the mosque when all the other doors were shut. On that occasion Abbas and Hamzah went to see God’s Prophet (MGB) and said, ‘You forced us out and let him stay in the mosque?’ The Prophet ﷺ replied, ‘I did not force you out and I did not let him stay. It was God who forced you out and let him stay. The Honorable the Exalted God revealed the following to my brother Moses (MGB), ‘Prepare a pure mosque and house yourself, Aaron and Aaron’s children in it.’ The Honorable the Exalted God revealed the following to me too, ‘Prepare a pure mosque and house yourself, Ali and Ali’s children in it.’’ They replied, ‘By God; no.’ Then Ali said, ‘I swear to you by God! Is there anyone amongst you about whom God’s Prophet (MGB) said, ‘The truth is with Ali and Ali is with the truth. These Two will be inseparable until they come to me at the Heavenly Pool’, other than me?’ They replied, ‘By God; no.’ Then Ali said, ‘I swear to you by God! Is there anyone amongst you who protected the life of God’s Prophet (MGB) with his own life when the polytheists came and wanted to kill The Prophet ﷺ other than me? I slept in his bed and God’s Prophet (MGB) went to the cave of Sowr. When the polytheists came to his house, they suspected that I was Muhammad (MGB). They woke me up from sleep and asked, ‘What happened to your cousin?’ I said, ‘I do not know.’ They beat me up to the point of death.’ They replied, ‘By God; no.’ Then Ali said, ‘I swear to you by God! Is there anyone amongst you about whom God’s Prophet (MGB) said what he (MGB) said about me as follows, ‘Indeed God has ordered me about the Mastery of Ali. His Mastery is the same as my Mastery. My Mastery is the same as the Mastery of my Lord! This is a covenant which my Lord has made with me and has made me responsible to declare it to you? Did you hear it?’ The people said, ‘Yes, we heard that.’ Then The Prophet ﷺ said, ‘However, there are those amongst you who say ‘we heard’ with his tongue, but carried the people on his shoulders and acts out of enmity with Ali.’ The people said, ‘O Prophet of God! Please introduce them to us.’ The Prophet ﷺ replied, ‘Indeed my Lord has ordered me to turn away from them due to what is destined and each one of you should suffice with what truly goes on in your hearts.’’ They replied, ‘By God; no.’ Then Ali said, ‘I swear to you by God! Is there anyone amongst you who killed nine of the champions of the Abduldar clan? Then their slave Sawab al-Habashi went to the field and yelled, ‘I swear by God that I shall kill Muhammad in revenge for the blood of my masters.’ Water was running out of his mouth and his eyes looked like two bowls filled with blood due to anger. Everyone was scared of him and stayed back. I went in front of him. He was as tall as a castle. There were two strikes of swords exchanged between the two of us and I cut him up into two pieces from his belly. The lower half of his body was still standing on his two feet, and all the Muslims were looking on and laughing at him.’ They replied, ‘By God; no.’ Then Ali said, ‘I swear to you by God! Is there anyone amongst you who has killed as many polytheists from the Quraysh as I have?’ They replied, ‘By God; no.’ Then Ali said, ‘I swear to you by God! Is there anyone amongst you who went to fight with Amr ibn ‘Abd Wudd when he came into the field and challenged someone to fight with other than me? You were all scared. It was I who stood up. God’s Prophet (MGB) asked me, ‘Where are you going?’ I replied, ‘To fight this corrupt person!’ The Prophet ﷺ said, ‘This is Amr ibn ‘Abd Wudd!’ I said, ‘O Prophet of God! If he is Amr ibn ‘Abd Wudd, I am Ali ibn Abi Talib.’ The Prophet ﷺ said the same thing to me again. I gave him (MGB) the same response. Then The Prophet ﷺ said, ‘Go in the name of God!’ Once I went there and approached him, he asked me, ‘Who are you?’ I said, ‘I am Ali ibn Abi Talib!’ He said, ‘O cousin! You are a noble fighter. Please return! I was friends with your father and I was his companion. I do not like to kill you.’ I told him, ‘O Amr! You have made a covenant with god to honor one of three proposals presented to you by anyone.’ Amr said, ‘Go ahead and propose!’ I said, ‘Bear witness that there is no god but God, Muhammad is God’s Prophet and confess to what he has brought to us from God.’ Amr said, ‘Present your second proposal.’ I said, ‘Return to your own house.’ Amr said, ‘By God, the women of Quraysh are going to say that I was scared and ran away from the battlefield.’ Then I said, ‘Get off your horse and let’s fight.’ He accepted this proposal and got off his horse. We started to fight and two strikes were exchanged between us. His strike ruptured my armor and his sword reached my head, but I chopped off his legs with my strike. God had him killed by my hands. Is there anyone amongst you to have done this?’ They replied, ‘By God; no.’ Then Ali said, ‘I swear to you by God! Is there anyone amongst you who dared to face Marhab when he stepped forward and said, ‘I am he whose mother has named him Marhab. I am a well-experienced champion - armed from head to foot. I attack, sometimes with the spear and sometimes with the sword,’ other than me? He struck me and I struck him. On his head was a covering carved from stone, since his head was so big that his helmet did not fit his head. I split open this covering and my sword hit his head killing him. Is there anyone amongst you who has performed such a feat?’ They replied, ‘By God; no.’ Then Ali said, ‘I swear to you by God! Is there anyone amongst you about whom God revealed the following known as the verse of purity upon His Prophet (MGB), ‘…And God only wishes to remove all abomination from you, ye members of the Family, and to make you pure and spotless’ and then, The Prophet ﷺ took his cloak and covered me under it along with Fatimah (MGB), Al-Hassan (MGB) and Al-Hussein (MGB) and said, ‘O my Lord! These are the members of my Family. Please remove all abomination from them and make them pure and spotless.’’ They replied, ‘By God; no.’ Then Ali said, ‘I swear to you by God! Is there anyone amongst you about whom the Prophet said, ‘I am the Master of all the Children of Adam. O Ali! You are the Master of the Arabs’ other than me?’ They replied, ‘By God; no.’ Then Ali said, ‘I swear to you by God! Is there anyone amongst you who has been the subject of the following. Once when God’s Prophet (MGB) was looking at the sky when he was in the mosque, he (MGB) saw that they were bringing something. Then he (MGB) saw that they were bringing something there. He rushed to that direction. His companions reached there after him. There were four black fellows who were carrying a coffin. The Prophet ﷺ told them, ‘Put it down.’ They put the coffin on the ground. The Prophet ﷺ said, ‘Open it up.’ They opened it up. There was a black slave in the coffin who had iron chains on his neck. God’s Prophet (MGB) asked, ‘Who is this?’ They answered, ‘He is a wicked and corrupt slave of the Riyaheen who has fled. We have been ordered to bury him with these chains on his neck as you can see.’ I looked at him and said, ‘O Prophet of God (MGB)! Whenever he saw me he said, ‘I swear by God that I love you. I swear by God that only believers love you and only atheists detest you.’ God’s Prophet (MGB) said, ‘O Ali! He has attained such a great reward from God just due to this belief that now seventy different tribes of angels each of which has one-thousand branches are praying over his corpse.’ God’s Prophet (MGB) opened up the chains from around his neck, prayed over his corpse and buried him.’ They replied, ‘By God; no.’ Then Ali said, ‘I swear to you by God! Is there anyone amongst you about whom God’s Prophet (MGB) has said about me, ‘Last night I was granted permission to supplicate. My Lord granted to me everything which I asked for. I asked God to grant you whatever I asked Him to grant me.’ Then I said, ‘Praise be to God.’’ They replied, ‘By God; no.’ Then Ali said, ‘I swear to you by God! Do you know that after God’s Prophet (MGB) dispatched Khalid ibn al-Walid to the Jadhimah clan and he did to them what he did, God’s Prophet (MGB) climbed up the pulpit and said the following thrice, ‘O my Lord! I am disgusted with what Khalid ibn al-Walid did.’ Then he (MGB) said, ‘O Ali! You go.’ Then I went and gave them compensation, and asked them by God to tell me if there was anything else to be compensated for? They said, ‘Yes. Since you asked us by God to tell you, the compensation for the dishes for our dogs and the knee-caps for our camels is still left.’ Then I gave them compensation for that, too. I also gave them a lot of gold which I had and told them, ‘This is expiation from God’s Prophet (MGB) to compensate for whatever you know or do not know and for any fears that your women and children may have experienced.’ Then I returned to God’s Prophet (MGB) and informed him (MGB) of what I had done. The Prophet ﷺ said, ‘I swear by God that I am more pleased of what you have done than red-haired camels. ’’ They replied, ‘By God. Yes.’ Then Ali said, ‘I swear to you by God! Did you hear God’s Prophet (MGB) say, ‘O Ali! They had my nation march in front of me last night. Once those who carry the flags passed by me, I prayed to God to forgive you and your followers.’’ They replied, ‘By God. Yes.’ Then Ali said, ‘I swear to you by God! Did you hear God’s Prophet (MGB) say, ‘O Abu Bakr! Go and chop off the neck of the person who is in such and such place.’ Then when Abu Bakr returned, The Prophet ﷺ asked him, ‘Did you kill him?’ Abu Bakr replied, ‘No. I found him praying.’ Then The Prophet ﷺ said, ‘O Umar! Go and kill him.’ Then when Umar returned The Prophet ﷺ asked him, ‘Did you kill him?’ Umar replied, ‘No. I found him praying.’ Then The Prophet ﷺ said, ‘I ordered you to kill him and you come back telling me that you found him praying?’ Then The Prophet ﷺ said, ‘O Ali! Go and kill him.’ Once I started to go, The Prophet ﷺ told me, ‘Kill him if you find him there.’ Once I returned I said, O Prophet of God (MGB)! I did not find anyone there.’ Then The Prophet ﷺ said, ‘Would you have killed him if you found him there?’’ They replied, ‘By God. Yes.’ Then Ali said, ‘I swear to you by God! Is there anyone amongst you about whom The Prophet ﷺ said, ‘Your friends are in Paradise and your enemies are in Hell’, other than me?’ They replied, ‘By God; no.’ Then Ali said, ‘I swear to you by God! Do you know that Ayesha told God’s Prophet (MGB), ‘Ibrahim (the son of Mariya al-Qabti) is not your son. He is the son of so and so Al-Qabti.’ The Prophet ﷺ told me, ‘O Ali! Go and kill him!’ Then I asked God’s Prophet (MGB), ‘Are you sending me there as a heated iron to execute this decree as soon as I get there, or do you want me to discover the truth?’ The Prophet ﷺ replied, ‘No. Go and discover the truth.’ Then I went after that Al-Qabti man. Once he saw me, he ran away into a garden. I followed him into the garden. Then he climbed up a date palm tree. I pursued him to the top of the tree. Once he realized that I was chasing him, he took off his under shorts and I noticed that he had been totally castrated. Then I returned and told the Prophet about it. The Prophet ﷺ said, ‘Thanks God for removing this accusation from the Household.’ Wasn’t it done by me?’ They replied, ‘By God. Yes.’ Then Ali said, ‘O God! Please be a witness to this.’”"

the right of your property is that you should not attain it except by legitimate means and you should only spend it for legitimate causes. You should not spend it improperly. ِ You should not prefer to use it for one who doesn’t show gratitude, instead of using it for yourself. Use it in ways which are considered to be obedience to your Lord. Do not be miserly with it or else you will suffer from grief and sorrow with their consequences. There is no power but in God.وأما حق إمامك في صلاتك فأن تعلم أنه قد تقلد السفارة فيما بينك وبين ربك عز وجل، وتكلم عنك ولم تتكلم عنه، ودعا لك ولم تدع له، وكفاك هول المقام بين يدي الله عز وجل، فان كان به نقص كان به دونك، وإن كان تماما كنت شريكه، ولم يكن له عليك فضل فوقى نفسك بنفسه وصلاتك بصلاته، فتشكر له على قدر ذلكوأما حق جليسك فأن تلين له جانبك وتنصفه في مجازاة اللفظ ولا تقوم من مجلسك إلا باذنه، ومن يجلس إليك يجوز له القيام عنك بغير إذنك وتنسي زلاته وتحفظ خيراته، ولا تسمعه إلا خيراوأما حق جارك فحفظه غائبا، وإكرامه شاهدا ونصرته إذا كان مظلوما، ولا تتبع له عورة، فان علمت عليه سوءا سترته عليه، وإن علمت أنه يقبل نصيحتك نصحته فيما بينك وبينه، ولا تسلمه عند شديدة، وتقيل عثرته، وتغفر ذنبه، وتعاشره معاشرة كريمة، ولا قوة إلا باللهوأما حق الصاحب فأن تصحبه بالتفضل والانصاف، وتكرمه كما يكرمك، وكن عليه رحمة، ولا تكن عليه عذابا، ولا قوة إلا باللهوأما حق الشريك فان غاب كفيته وإن حضر رعيته، ولا تحكم دون حكمه، ولا تعمل رأيك دون مناظرته، وتحفظ عليه ماله، ولا تخونه فيما عز أو هان من أمره فإن يد الله تبارك وتعالى على الشريكين ما لم يتخاونا ولا قوة إلا باللهوأما حق مالك فأن لا تأخذه إلا من حله، ولا تنفقه إلا في وجهه، ولا تؤثر على نفسك من لا يحمدك، فاعمل فيه بطاعة ربك، ولا تبخل به وتبوء بالحسرة والندامة مع التبعة، ولا قوة إلا باللهوأما حق غريمك الذي يطالبك فإن كنت موسرا أعطيته، وإن كنت معسرا أرضيته بحسن القول ورددته عن نفسك ردا لطيفا وحق الخليط أن لا تغره، ولا تغشه، ولا تخدعه، وتتقى الله تبارك وتعالى في أمرهوحق الخصم المدعي عليك فإن كان ما يدعي عليك حقا كنت شاهده على نفسك ولم تظلمه، وأوفيته حقه، وإن كان ما يدعي باطلا رفقت به، ولم تأت في أمره غير الرفق، ولم تسخط ربك في أمره، ولا قوة إلا باللهوحق خصمك الذي تدعي عليه إن كنت محقا في دعوتك أجملت مقاولته، ولم تجحد حقه، وإن كنت مبطلا في دعوتك اتقيت الله عز وجل وتبت إليه، وتركت الدعوىوحق المستشير إن علمت أن له رأيا أشرت عليه، وإن لم تعلم أرشدته إلى من يعلم، وحق المشير عليك أن لا تتهمه فيما لا يوافقك من رأيه، فان وافقك حمدت الله عز وجلوحق المستنصح أن تودي إليه النصحية وليكن مذهبك الرحمة له والرفق بهوحق الناصح أن تلين له جناحك وتصغى إليه بسمعك، فان أتى الصواب حمدت الله عز وجل وإن لم يوافق رحمته، ولم تتهمه وعلمت أنه أخطأ، ولم تؤاخذه بذلك إلا أن يكون مستحقا للتهمة فلا تعبأ بشيء من أمره على حال، ولا قوة إلا باللهوحق الكبير توقيره لسنه، وإجلاله لتقدمه في الاسلام قبلك وترك مقابلتـه عنـدالخصام، ولا تسبقه إلى طريق ولا تتقدمه، ولا تستجهله، وإن جهل عليك احتملته وأكرمته لحق الاسلام وحرمتهوحق الصغير رحمته في تعليمه والعفو عنه والستر عليه والرفق به والمعونة لهوحق السائل إعطاؤه على قدر حاجتهوحق المسؤول إن أعطى فاقبل منه بالشكر والمعرفة بفضله، وإن منع فاقبل عذرهوحق من سرك الله تعالى ذكره أن تحمد الله عز وجل أولا، ثم تشكرهوحق من أساءك أن تعفو عنه، وإن علمت أن العفو عنه يضر انتصرتقال الله تبارك وتعالى: ""وَلَمَنِ انْتَصَرَ بَعْدَ ظُلْمِهِ فَأُولَئِكَ مَا عَلَيْهِمْ مِنْ سَبِيلٍ .""وحق أهل ملتك اضمار السلامة والرحمة لهم، والرفق بمسيئهم، وتألفهم واستصلاحهم، وشكر محسنهم وكف الاذى عنهم وتحب لهم ما تحب لنفسك وتكره لهم ما تكره لنفسك، وأن تكون شيوخهم بمنزله أبيك، وشبانهم بمنزلة إخوتك، وعجائزهم بمنزلة امك، والصغار بمنزلة أولادكوحق الذمة أن تقبل منهم ما قبل الله عز وجل، ولا تظلمهم ما وفوا الله عز وجل بعهده","23-1 Ali ibn Ahmad ibn Musa - may God be pleased with him - narrated that Muhammad ibn Aba Abdullah Al-Kufy quoted on the authority of Ja’far ibn Muhammad ibn Malik Al-Fazari, on the authority of Khayran ibn Daher, on the authority of Ahmad ibn Ali ibn Suleiman al-Jabali, on the authority of his father, on the authority of Muhammad ibn Ali, on the authority of Muhammad ibn Fuzayl that Abi Hamzih al-Sumaly said that the following is the Treatise of Ali ibn al-Hussein (MGB) to some of his companions:“Know that God the Honorable the Exalted has rights incumbent upon you and that these encompass you in every motion through which you move, every rest which you take, every way-station in which you reside, every limb which you employ, and every instrument which you use.And the greatest of God’s rights incumbent upon you is what He has made incumbent upon you for Himself from His rights: that which is the root of all rights. Then there are those that God the Honorable the Exalted has made incumbent upon you in yourself, from your head to your foot, according to the diversity of your organs. Then the Honorable the Exalted God has established for your tongue a right incumbent upon you, and for your hearing a right incumbent upon you, and for your sight a right incumbent upon you, and for your hands a right incumbent upon you, and for your legs a right incumbent upon you, and for your stomach a right incumbent upon you, and for your private parts a right incumbent upon you. These are the seven organs through which deeds take place.Then the Honorable the Exalted has established for your deeds rights incumbent upon you. Then He established for your ritual prayer a right incumbent upon you, and for your fasting a right incumbent upon you, and for your charity a right incumbent upon you, and for your offering a rightincumbent upon you, and for your deeds a right incumbent upon you. Then the rights extend out from you to others who have rights incumbent upon you.And the most incumbent of them incumbent upon you are the rights toward your leaders, then the rights toward your subjects - those whom you teach and those whom you own. And then the rights toward your relations of kin. And from these rights other rights branch out.The rights of your leaders are threefold: The one most incumbent upon you is the right of him who trains you through authority, then the right of him who trains you through knowledge - as the uneducated is subject to the learned.And then there is the right of those who are your subjects through property, such as wives and those owned by the right hand . And the rights of your relations of kin hold according to the degree of closeness of the relationship. Then the most incumbent one upon you is the right of your mother, then the right of your father, then the right of your child, then the right of your brother, then the next nearest, and then the next nearest, and the most worthy, and then the next most worthy.Then there is the right of your master who favors you , then the right of the slave, the servant whose favors reach you , then the right of him who treats you kindly, then the right of your caller to prayer, then the right of your prayer leader, then the right of your sitting companion, then the right of your neighbor, then the right of your companion, then the right of your partner, then the right of your property, then the right of the debtor who must pay you back, then the right of the one who has given you a loan who demands his debt to be paid back, then the right of your associate, then the right of your adversary who has a claim against you, then the right of your adversary against whom you have a claim, then the right of him who seeks your advice, then the right of him whose advice you seek, then the right of him who seeks your counsel, then the right of him whose counsel you seek, then the right of him who is older than you are, then the right of him who is younger than you are, then the right of him who begs from you, then the right of him from whom you beg, then the right of him who wrongs you either verbally or physically, then the right of him who does something to make you happy either verbally or physically whether intentionally or unintentionally, then the right of the people of your creed, then the right of those under the protection of Islam, then the rights which are incumbent upon you according to the vicissitudes of life and the availability of means. Therefore blessed be the one whom God helps fulfill the rights that He has made incumbent upon him and whom He grants success therein and guides him.Then the greatest right of God incumbent upon you is that you worship Him without associating anything with Him. When you do that with sincerity, He has made it binding upon Himself to give you sufficiency in the affairs of this world and the next.And the right of yourself incumbent upon you is that you employ it in obeying the Honorable the Exalted God. And the right of the tongue is that you consider it too noble for obscenity, accustom it to good, do not use it except in situations of needs and benefits, use it to be kind to the people and talk to them nicely. And the right of hearing is to keep it pure by not listening to gossip and not listening to what is not allowed to be heard. And the right of your sight is that you lower it before everything which is unlawful to you and that you abandon using it except in situations in which you can take heed.And the right of your hand is that you do not stretch it towards that which is unlawful to you. And the right of your legs is that you do not walk with them toward that which is unlawful to you. Then use them to stop on the way and look out so that they do not slip and you fall into the Fire. And the right of your stomach is that you do not make it into a container for that which is unlawful, and that you do not overeat. And the right of your private parts is that you should protect them from adultery and guard them from being looked upon.Then the right of your ritual prayer is that you should know that it is an arrival at the threshold of the Honorable the Exalted God and that through it you are standing before the Honorable the Exalted God. And when you realize that, then you will stand in the station of him who is lowly, vile, beseeching, trembling, hopeful, fearful, and abased. And you will magnify Him who is before you with stillness and humbleness, and accept Him wholeheartedly, and consider His bounds and His rights. And the right of pilgrimage is that you should know that it is an arrival at the threshold of your Lord and a flight to Him from your sins; and through it your repentance is accepted and you perform an obligation made incumbent upon you by God.And the right of fasting is that You should know it is a veil, which God has set up over your tongue, your hearing and your sight, your private parts and your stomach, to protect you from the Fire . Should you break your fast you have pierced the veil which God has placed upon you. And the right of charity is that you should know that it is a storing away with your Lord the Honorable the Exalted, and a deposit for which you will have no need for witnesses. Then once you know this, you will be more confident ofit, if you donate it in secret than if you donate it in public. You should know that your charity would fend off calamities and ailments from you in this world, and fend off the Fire from you in the Hereafter. And the right of the offering is that through it you purify your will toward God the Honorable the Exalted. You should not make the offering for the eyes of His creatures. If this is so, you will neither expose yourself to God’s Mercy, nor benefit from the saving of your spirit on the Day on which you shall meet Him.Then the right of the possessor of authority is that you should know that God has established you as a trial for him. God is testing him through the authority the Honorable the Exalted God has given him over you. And you should not quarrel with him while he has complete dominance over you, for thereby you cause your own destruction and his, too. Should you do so, you will deserve to be considered to be his assistant acting against yourself and as his partner in what he does to you.And the right of the one who trains you through knowledge is glorifying him; respecting his meetings; listening well to him; being responsive to him; not raising your voice over his voice; not answering anyone who asks him before he answers; not talking while you are in his meeting; not gossiping about anyone in his presence; defending him if someone gossips about him near you; covering up his faults and publicize his outstanding traits; not associating with his enemies; and not being an enemy of his friends. Should you do so, God’s angels would witness on your behalf that you went to him and acquired his knowledge, and God would exalt his name amongst the people.And the right of him who trains you through property is that you should be subordinate to him and not disobey him - unless obeying him would displease God - for there can be no obedience to a creature when there is disobedience to God.”Then the right of your subjects through authority is that you should know that they have been made subjects through their weakness and your strength. Hence it is incumbent upon you to act with justice toward them and to be like a compassionate father towards them. You should forgive them because of their ignorance, not hurry to punish them, and thank God for the power over them which He has given to you.And the right of your subjects through knowledge is that you should know that the Honorable the Exalted God established you over them through what He has granted you of knowledge, and what He has granted authority over His Treasures of Wisdom. If you do well in teaching the people, not treatingthem roughly or annoying them, then God will increase His bounty toward you. However, if you withhold your knowledge from people or treat them roughly when they seek knowledge from you, then it will be God’s right to deprive you of the knowledge and its splendor, and make you belittled in the people’s eyes.And the right of your subject through matrimonial contract is that you should know that the Honorable the Exalted God has made her a repose, and a companion for you. Then you should know that this is God’s blessing for you. Then you should honor her and treat her gently. Yet your right over her is more incumbent. You must treat her with compassion, since she is your prisoner whom you feed and clothe. If she is ignorant, you should pardon her.And the right of your subject through being your slave is that you should know that he is a creature of your Lord and is made of the same flesh and blood. And you only own him, but you are very inferior to God and you have not created him. And you have not created any of his organs, nor do you provide his daily sustenance; rather it is the Honorable the Exalted God who gives you sufficiency for that. Then He subjugated him to you, entrusted him to you, and provisionally consigned him to you. So protect him there , and treat him well just as well as God has treated you. And if you dislike him, you ought to let him go and replace him, but do not torment God’s creature. And there is no power but in God.Then the right of your mother is that you should know that she carried you where no one carries anyone, and she fed you with the fruit of her heart that which no one feeds anyone, and she protected you with all her organs. She did not care if she went hungry as long as you ate, if she was thirsty as long as you drank, if she was naked as long as you were clothed, if she was in the sun as long as you were in the shade, if she was deprived of sleeping as long as you were resting. She protected you from the heat and the cold of this world. Then you should thank her for all that. You will not be able to show her gratitude unless through God’s help and His granting you success.And the right of your father is that you should know that he is your root. And without him, you would not be. Whenever you see anything in yourself which pleases you, you should know that your father is the root of its blessing upon you. So praise God and thank Him in recognition of that. And there is no power but in God.And the right of your child is that you should know that he is from you and he will be ascribed to you in this world due to both his good deeds and hisevil deeds. And you are responsible for what has been entrusted to you in teaching him good conduct, and guiding him toward his Lord - the Honorable the Exalted - and helping him to obey Him. Then regarding his affairs, act like one who knows that he would be rewarded for treating him with kindness and punished for maltreating him.And the right of your brother is that you should know that he is your hand, your support, and your power. Take him not as a weapon with which to disobey God, nor as a means with which to oppress God’s creatures. And do not neglect to help him against his enemy, and give him good counsel. If he obeys God, it is fine. Else God should be more preferable and more honorable to you than he is. And there is no power but in God.Then the right of your master who has favored you is that you should know that he has spent his property for you and has brought you out of the abasement of slavery and its desolation, and has brought you into the honor of freedom and its sociability. And he has freed you from the captivity of his own possession, has released the bonds of his slavery from you, has given you ownership of yourself, and has given you the freedom to worship your Lord. Then you should know that he is the closest creature to you in your life and after your death. It is incumbent upon you to assist him and he is more meritorious than yourself to receive your assistance and support regarding what he needs. And there is no power but in God.And the right of the slave whom you have favored is that you should know that the Honorable the Exalted God has made your freeing him a means of access to Him and a veil against the Fire. Your immediate reward is to inherit from him - if he doesn’t have any relatives - as a compensation for the property you have spent for him, and your ultimate reward is the Garden.And the right of him who treats you kindly is that you should thank him and acknowledge his kindness; spread the good word around about him; and sincerely pray for him between you and the Honorable the Exalted God the Praised One. Then if you do that, you have thanked him both in private and in public. Then if you are able to practically recompense him, do recompense him.And the right of your caller to prayer is that you should know that he is reminding you of your Lord - the Honorable the Exalted - calling you to your good fortune, and helping you to accomplish what God has made obligatory upon you. So thank him for that just as you thank one who does good to you.And the right of your leader in your ritual prayer is that you should know that he has taken on the role of a mediator between you and the Honorable the Exalted God; he speaks for you, but you do not speak for him; he supplicates for you, but you do not supplicate for him. And he has spared you the anxiety of standing before the Honorable the Exalted God. Should he perform the prayer imperfectly, he is held responsible for that. However, should he perform it perfectly, you are considered to be his partner. There is no superiority in this for him over you, or for his prayer over yours. Therefore, thank him for this.And the right of your sitting companion is that you should treat him gently, warmly welcome him, be fair while talking with him, and not leave him without his permission. If he is the first one to come and sit with you, he can leave you when he wishes to. You should forget his mistakes and remember his good qualities, and you should tell nothing about him but good.And the right of your neighbor is that you should be a guardian for him when he is absent, and you should honor him when he is present, and you should assist him when he is oppressed. You should not seek out any of his faults. However, if you should discover any of his faults unintentionally, you should keep them as a secret. If you know that he would accept your advice, you should advise him in private. Do not forsake him at times of hardship, pardon his deviation, overlook his mistakes, forgive him his sins, and associate with him in an honorable manner. There is no power but in God.And the right of the companion is that you should act as his companion with nobility and fairness and honor him as he honors you. Be like mercy upon him, and not as a chastisement. And there is no power but in God.And the right of the partner is that you should take care of his affairs in his absence. And you should treat him equally when he is present. And you should not make any decisions on your own without considering his opinion. And you should not act according to your own opinion before discussing it with him. You should safeguard his property, and not cheat him in this regard, whether there is honor or disdain in it. Indeed it has been transmitted to us: “The Blessed the Sublime God’s hand is with partners as long as they do not cheat.” And there is no power but in God.And the right of him to whom you owe a debt is that, if you have the means, you pay him back. And if you are in straitened circumstances, you satisfy him with good words and send him away with gentleness.And the right of the associate is that you should not fool him, trick him or deceive him. You should fear the Blessed the Sublime God regarding his affairs.And the right of the adversary who has a claim against you is that if his claim against you is true you give witness to it against yourself. You do not wrong him and you give him his full due. If what he claims against you is false, you act with kindness toward him and you show nothing in his affair other than kindness. You do not displease your Lord in his affair. And there is no power but in God.And the right of the adversary against whom you have a claim is that if your claim against him is true, you maintain polite moderation in speaking to him and you do not deny him his right. If your claim is false, you fear the Honorable the Exalted God, repent to Him, and abandon your claim.And the right of him who seeks your advice is that you should exert all efforts to advise him if you can provide him with good advice. However, if you do not have any good advice for him, you should refer him to someone else whom you know and trust his advice yourself.And the right of him whose advice you seek is that you should not accuse him when he gives you advice that doesn’t confirm your own opinion. And if it was appropriate for you, you should thank the Honorable the Exalted God for it.And the right of him who seeks your counsel is that you should give him your counsel. You should choose having mercy and kindness as your course of action.And the right of your counselor is that you should be whole-heartedly attentive to him, and listen to him. If what he presents to you is right, you should praise the Honorable the Exalted God for it. However, if what he presents to you doesn’t agree with you, you should be kind to him and make no accusations against him. And you should know that if he is wrong, you should not hold him responsible in this regard. However, if he deserves to be accused, you should not trust him under any circumstances. And there is no power but in God.And the right of him who is older than you are is that you should respect him because of his age, and honor his submission to God if he is one of the noble ones in Islam. You should recognize his seniority and stop confrontinghim in disputes and should not surpass him or walk ahead of him. And you should not treat him foolishly. If he should treat you foolishly, you should put up with him and honor him to respect his being an older Muslim.And the right of him who is younger than you are is to be friendly with him, train and educate him, pardon him, cover up his faults, and be patient with him and help him.And the right of him who begs from you is that you give to him in the measure of his need.And the right of him from whom you beg is that you should accept from him whatever he grants you with gratitude and acknowledge his nobility. And you should accept his excuse if he withholds and think well of him.And the right of him by which the Sublime God makes you happy is that you first praise the Honorable the Exalted God, then thank that person.And the right of him who wrongs you is that you pardon him. However, if you know that your pardon will harm him, you should defend yourself. The Blessed the Sublime God says, “But indeed if any do help and defend themselves after a wrong (done) to them, against such there is no cause of blame.”And the right of the people of your creed is that you should whole-heartedly provide safety for them; gently show them mercy; treat their wrongdoers with patience; treat them with friendliness; seek their welfare; and thank those of them who do good to you and to themselves. And keep harm away from them. You should love for them what you love for yourself and dislike for them what you dislike for yourself. Their old men stand in the place of your father, their youth in the place of your brothers, their old women in the place of your mother, and their young ones in the place of your children.And the right of those under the protection of Islam is that you should accept from them what the Honorable the Exalted God has accepted from them, do not oppress them and fulfill what God has established for them under His Protection and Covenant."

al-Daq’qaq, al-Hussein ibn Ibrahim ibn Hisham al-Mokattib and Ali ibn Abdullah al-Warraq - may God be pleased with them- narrated that Abul-Ab’bas Ahmad ibn Yahya ibn Zakaria al-Qat’tan quoted on the authority of Bakr ibn Abdullah ibn Habib, on the authority of Tamim ibn Buhlool, on the authority of Suleiman ibn Hakeem, on the authority of Soor ibn Yazid, on the authority of Makhul, “The Commander of the Faithful Ali ibn Abi Talib (MGB) said, ‘Indeed those companions of the Prophet who know the whole Quran by heart all know that there is no one amongst them who has any virtues which I do not have, or I may even be surpass him in that respect. However, I have seventy virtues which none of them has.’I asked, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! Please inform me about those virtues.’ Then Ali (MGB) said,‘1- I never associated any partners with God - even for a twinkling of an eye. I never worshipped Lat and Uzza.2- I never drank any alcohol.3- I have been with God’s Prophet since my childhood when God’s Prophet (MGB) asked my father to become my guardian. From then on I have been with him, eaten and drank with him, associated and talked with him.4- I am the first person to believe in and submit to Islam.5- God’s Prophet (MGB) told me, ‘O Ali! Your relationship to me is like that of Aaron’s relationship to Moses (MGB) except that there will be no Prophets after me.’6- I was the last person who separated from God’s Prophet (MGB) and placed him in his grave.7- When God’s Prophet (MGB) wanted to go to the cave of Sowr, he put me to sleep in his own bed and covered me up with his blanket. When the polytheists came to his house, they suspected that I was Muhammad (MGB). They woke me up from sleep and asked, ‘What happened to your friend?’ I said, ‘He (MGB) went to take care of something.’ They said, ‘If he had escaped, then Ali would have escaped along with him.’8- God’s Prophet (MGB) taught me one-thousand gates of knowledge each of which opens up to one-thousand other gates.9- God’s Prophet (MGB) told me, ‘When the Honorable the Exalted God resurrects the first up to the last of the people on the Resurrection day, He will install a pulpit for me above that of all the other Prophets and install a pulpit for you above that of all other Trustees. Then you shall climb up it.10- I heard God’s Prophet (MGB) say, ‘O Ali! I have not been given anything in the Hereafter unless I asked for the like of it for you.’11- I heard God’s Prophet (MGB) say, ‘O Ali! You are my brother and I am your brother. Your hand is in my hand until you enter Paradise.’12- I heard God’s Prophet (MGB) say, ‘O Ali! Your similitude in my nation is like that of Noah’s Ark which whoever boarded was rescued, and anyone who did not was drowned.’13- God’s Prophet (MGB) fastened his blessed turban with his own blessed hands on my head. He also prayed for my victory over God’s enemies and thus I was able to defeat them with God’s Permission.14- Once God’s Prophet (MGB) told me to touch the dried nipples of a calf so that it may give some milk. I told him (MGB), ‘O Prophet of God! It would be better if you do it.’ The Prophet (MGB) said, ‘O Ali! What you do is just like what I do.’ Then I touched its nipple and it gave some milk. I gave some milk to God’s Prophet (MGB). Then an old woman came and lamented from thirst. I gave her some milk to drink. God’s Prophet (MGB) said, ‘I asked the Blessed the Sublime God to bless your hand and he accepted my supplication.’15- God’s Prophet (MGB) made me his Trustee and told me, ‘O Ali! No one but you can perform the ablutions for the burial for me. No one but you can see my genitals. Should anyone else see them, their eyes will come out of their eye-sockets.’I asked, ‘O Prophet of God! How can I turn you around by myself?’ The Prophet (MGB) replied, ‘You will be assisted by the invisible.’ I swear by God that whenever I wished to turn one part around (during the ablutions for the deceased), it turned around by itself.16- When I wanted to undress the Prophet’s corpse to perform the ritual ablutions (wuzu) for the deceased for the Prophet (MGB), there came a voice which announced, ‘O Muhammad’s Trustee! Do not undress him. Perform the ritual ablutions (wuzu) with his clothes on.’ Thus, I performed the ritual ablutions (wuzu) for him from over his clothing. I swear to God who honored him with Prophethood that I did not see his private parts. Thus, God made me especial in this regard amongst the Prophet’s companions.17- Even though Abu Bakr and Umar had asked for Fatimah (MGB) to be married to them, the Honorable the Exalted God married her to me from above the seventh heaven. God’s Prophet (MGB) said, ‘O Ali! May this blessing be pleasant for you. The Honorable the Exalted God has married Fatimah (MGB) who is the Master of Women in Paradise and of my own flesh and blood to you.’ Then I asked, ‘O Prophet of God! Am I not of your flesh and blood, too?’ The Prophet (MGB) replied, ‘O Ali! Yes you are from me and I am from you just like the right hand and the left hand. I am not independent of you in this world and the Hereafter.’18- God’s Prophet (MGB) told me, ‘O Ali! You will be the one carrying the flag called ‘Leva ul-Hamd’ in the Hereafter. You will be the one sitting closest to me on the Resurrection Day. They will spread a seat for me and a seat for you. I will be amongst the Prophets and you will be amongst the Trustees. They will put a crown of light and nobility on your head. Seventy-thousand angels will surround you until the Honorable the Exalted God finishes the Reckoning of the creatures. You will be the first man whose grave will be split apart (for the Resurrection) along with me. You will be the first one to stop on the Bridge (of Al-Sirat) with me. You will be the first one to be dressed when they dress, and brought back to life when they bring back to life. You will be the first one to reside with me in the uppermost Heaven. You will be the first one to drink the sealed drink of Paradise with me which is sealed by musk.’19- God’s Prophet (MGB) told me, ‘You will fight with the perfidious party, the deviators, and the apostates in the near future. For everyone of them who fights with you, you shall intercede on behalf of 100,000 of your followers.’ I asked, ‘O Prophet of God! Who are in the perfidious party?’ The Prophet (MGB) replied, ‘They are Talha and Zubayr who pledge allegiance to you in Hijaz, but breach it in Iraq. When they do that, you should fight them until the residents of the Earth get rid of them.’ I asked, ‘Who are the deviators?’ The Prophet (MGB) replied, ‘Muawiyah and his companions.’ I asked, ‘Who are the apostates? ’ The Prophet (MGB) replied, ‘They will be the companions of Zil-Sadiyeh who will run away from the religion as a bow runs away from an arrow. You should kill them since that would constitute a relief for the residents of the Earth, an abrupt chastisement for them and a savings for you near the Honorable the Exalted God for the Resurrection Day.’20- I heard from the God’s Prophet (MGB) who said, ‘Your similitude in my nation is like that of the door of Hetteh amongst the Children of Israel. Whoever enters into friendship with you, it is as if he has entered the gate which the Honorable the Exalted God has ordered (people) to enter.’21- I heard God’s Prophet (MGB) say, ‘I am the city of knowledge, and Ali is its portal. Whoever wishes to gain knowledge should go through that portal.’ Then he (MGB) added, ‘O Ali! Soon you will observe my promise and fight in the same manner as I do, but my nation will disagree with you.’22- I heard God’s Prophet (MGB) say, ‘The Blessed the Sublime God has created my two (grand)children Al-Hassan and Al-Hussein (MGB) from a light which he has induced into you and Fatimah. They shine just like two earrings that shake in the ear while hanging from the ears. Their brightness is seventy times that of the brightness of martyrs. O Ali! Indeed the Honorable the Exalted God has given promised me to honor them such as He has never honored anyone else except for the Messengers and the Prophets.’23- God’s Prophet (MGB) gave me his ring, armor and sword-belt in his lifetime and fastened his sword to my waist himself when all his companions and my uncle Abbas were present. Thus, the Honorable the Exalted God has made me especial in this respect, and not them.24- When the Honorable the Exalted God revealed the following verse, ‘O ye who believe! When ye consult the Messenger in private, spend something in charity before your private consultation..’ I had a gold coin. I sold it for ten Dirhams and gave it away in charity before my private consultation with God’s Prophet (MGB). I swear by God that none of the companions of the Prophet (MGB) did that either before or after me. Then the Honorable the Exalted God revealed the following verse to the Prophet, ‘Is it that ye are afraid of spending sums in charity before your private consultation (with him)? If, then, ye do not so, and God forgives you, then (at least) establish regular prayer; practise regular charity; and obey God and His Apostle. And God is well-acquainted with all that ye do.’ Is it not that ‘and God forgives you’ refers to a sin committed for which God forgives them.25- I heard God’s Prophet (MGB) say, ‘Paradise is forbidden for the Prophets to enter before I enter it, and it is forbidden upon the Trustees to enter before you enter it. O Ali! The Blessed the Sublime God has given me glad tidings about you which He has not given to any of the Prophets who came before me. He has given me glad tidings that you will be the Master of the Trustees and your two sons Al-Hassan and Al-Hussein (MGB) will be the two Masters of the Youth in Paradise on the Resurrection Day.’26- My brother Ja’far will be adorned with two wings made of pearl, ruby and chrysolite and fly along with the angels in Paradise.27- My uncle Hamzih will be the Master of the Martyrs in Paradise.28- God’s Prophet (MGB) said, ‘The Blessed the Sublime God has given me a promise about you which will be fulfilled. God has established me as a Prophet and has established you as a Trustee. Soon you shall experience from my nation the same treatment which Moses (MGB) experienced from Pharaoh. However, be patient and consider it to be from God until you see me again. I am the friend of your friends and I consider your enemies to be my enemies.’29- Indeed I heard God’s Prophet (MGB) say, ‘O Ali! You are the Owner of the Heavenly Pool . No one else will own it. Then some people will come to you and ask for water. You will turn them down and say that there is not even a sip of water. They will return with a black face. Then my followers and yours will enter. You will say, ‘return while satiated with water.’ They will return with a white face.’30- I heard God’s Prophet (MGB) say, ‘My nation will be resurrected and become united on the Resurrection Day with five flags. The first flag which will come will be the flag of Muawiyah who is the Pharaoh of my nation. The second flag will be that of Amr ibn al-A’as who is the Sameri of the nation. The third flag will be that of Abu Musa Ash’ari who is like the Catholic Archbishop (Al-Jaseliq) of this nation. The fourth flag will be that of Abil A’oar al-Salmy. Yours will be the fifth flag under which all the believers will be gathered while you are their Leader. Then the Blessed the Sublime will tell those four groups: ‘Turn back and seek brightness.’ Then a wall will be erected in front of them which has a door. In it there is mercy who are my friends and followers. Then those who fought me along with the Kharajites , those who broke their pledge and the people misled from the straight path will knock at that door - that is the door of mercy being my followers. They will cry out, ‘Were we not we with you?’ They will reply, ‘Yes, you were. However, you deceived yourselves, you were hindered, you doubted and worldly aspirations deceived you until God’s order (i.e. death) arrived and pride (i.e. Satan) deceived you. Today nothing will be accepted of you as recompense.’ Nothing will be accepted of those who rejected faith, either. Your place shall be in the Fire. It will be the place you shall turn to. What a bad destiny that is! Then my nation and my followers will come to drink and they get satiated from Muhammad’s (MGB) Heavenly Pool . A cane will be in my hand made of boxthorn wood with which I drive God’s enemies away just as people push others’ camels away from drinking water.31- Indeed I heard God’s Prophet (MGB) say, “Were it not from the fear of what the Boasters might say about you similar to what the Christians say about Jesus - the son of Mary (MGB), I would have expressed one of your virtues and then anyone who passed by you would take a piece of the dirt from under your feet for healing.”32- Indeed I heard God’s Prophet (MGB) say, “The Blessed the Sublime God helped me regarding fear of enemies. I asked God to help you in the same way in this regard.”33- God’s Prophet (MGB) put his head to my ear and taught me whatever has been and whatever there will be up until the Resurrection Day. The Honorable the Exalted God has let me hear this from His Prophet’s (MGB) tongue.34- When the Christians challenged the Prophet (MGB), the Honorable the Exalted God revealed the following in this regard, ‘If anyone disputes in this matter with thee, now after (full) knowledge Hath come to thee, say:""Come! let us gather together,- our sons and your sons, our women and your women, ourselves and yourselves: Then let us earnestly pray, and invoke the curse of Allah on those who lie!’ Here ‘ourselves’ referred to God’s Prophet (MGB) himself, ‘our women’ referred to Fatimah (MGB), ‘our sons’ referred to Al-Hassan (MGB) and Al-Hussein (MGB). Then the Christians felt sorry and asked God’s Prophet (MGB) to forgive them and he (MGB) forgave them. I swear by Him who revealed the Torah to Moses (MGB), and the Quran to Muhammad (MGB) that they would have all been transmuted into monkeys and pigs, if they had engaged in invocation with us.”35- At the Battle of Badr God’s Prophet (MGB) sent me to bring him a handful of pebbles. I held the pebbles and smelled them They smelled like musk. I gave them to the Prophet (MGB). He (MGB) took them and threw them at the atheists. Four of them were from Paradise. One was from the East. One was from the West. And another one was from beneath the Throne. There were one-hundred thousand angels who accompanied each of them to assist us. The Honorable the Exalted God has not honored anyone else with this either before or after that day.36- I heard God’s Prophet (MGB) say, ‘O Ali! Woe to your murderer! He is more miserable than Nimrood, more wretched than those who ham-strung the she-camel . The Throne of God the Merciful will be shaken up due to your murder. O Ali! I give you glad tidings that you are going to be amongst the sincere friends, martyrs and good-doers.’37- The Blessed the Sublime God has chosen me amongst the companions of Muhammad (MGB) to know the abrogated and the abolished; the firm and the dubious; and the especial and the general rules. This is an honor granted by God to me and His Prophet (MGB). God’s Prophet (MGB) told me, ‘O Ali! The Honorable the Exalted God has ordered me to make you near to myself and not to keep you at a distance from me, to teach you and not to speak harshly with you. It is incumbent upon me to obey my Lord and it is incumbent upon you to guard what you learn.’38- God’s Prophet (MGB) chose me for a battle, made supplications for me and made me informed about the affairs that would follow after him. Some of his companions felt bad about this and said, ‘If Muhammad had the power he would even establish his cousin as a Prophet.’ The Honorable the Exalted God honored me by informing me of this issue from the Prophet’s tongue.39- Indeed I heard God’s Prophet (MGB) say, ‘Whoever thinks that he loves me but he dislikes Ali is lying. My love and Ali’s love will not be united except in a believer’s heart. O Ali! Indeed the Honorable the Exalted God has established those who love me and you as the first people in Paradise. God has also established those who hate me and you as the first group of my nation who will be in Hell.’40- In one of the battles, God’s Prophet (MGB) sent me after water to a well, but it had no water in it. I returned and reported that to him. He (MGB) asked, ‘Does it have any mud?’ I replied, ‘Yes.’ The Prophet (MGB) said, ‘Just bring some of its mud.’ Then I brought some mud from the well. The Prophet (MGB) said something to the mud and told me to dump it in the middle of a well. I threw the mud in the well. Suddenly water gushed out from the Earth and the well filled up. I went to the Prophet (MGB) and informed him about what had happened. The Prophet (MGB) said, ‘O Ali! You succeeded and the water gushed out due to your blessing. This was an especial honor for me and no other one amongst the companions of the Prophet (MGB).41- Indeed I heard God’s Prophet (MGB) say, ‘O Ali! I give you the glad tidings that Gabriel (MGB) came to me and said, ‘O Muhammad! Indeed the Blessed the Sublime God looked favorably upon your companions and considered your cousin and the husband of your daughter Fatimah to be the best of your companions. God established him as your Trustee and your messenger.’42- Indeed I heard God’s Prophet say, ‘O Ali! I give you the glad tidings that your home in Paradise will be in front of my home and you will be with me in the uppermost resting-place in the highest Heaven.’ I said, ‘O Prophet of God! What is the uppermost Heaven?’ He (MGB) replied, ‘It is a cupola made of white pearls with 70,000 doors. O Ali! That shall be the place of residence for you and I.’43- Indeed God’s Prophet (MGB) said, ‘The Honorable the Exalted God has firmly established my love as well as your love in the hearts of believers as He established my hatred as well as yours in the hearts of the hypocrites. Only pious believers love you and only hypocrite unbelievers despise you.’44- Indeed I heard God’s Prophet (MGB) say, ‘None of the Arabs but those born out of fornication despise you. None of the Persians but the miserable ones despise you. None of the women except those with anal hemorrhage despise you.’45- Indeed God’s Prophet (MGB) called me in when my eyes hurt and threw his saliva into my eyes and said, ‘O God! Please cool its heat and heat its coolness.’ I swear by God that I have not had any more pains in my eyes since then.46- God’s Prophet (MGB) ordered all his uncles and companions to shut all the doors from the mosque to their homes, except for the one to my house as ordered by the Honorable the Exalted God. No one else has received such an honor.47- In his will to me God’s Prophet (MGB) ordered me to pay back his debts and fulfill his promises. I said, ‘O Prophet of God! You know that I do not have any wealth.’ The Prophet (MGB) replied, ‘God will help you.’ God made it easy for me to pay back all his debts and fulfill all his promises. Once I counted that it exceeded eighty-thousand (Dirhams). Then I made a will to my son Al-Hassan (MGB) to fulfill what had been left.48- God’s Prophet (MGB) came to my house. We had not had anything to eat for three days. The Prophet (MGB) said, ‘O Ali! Do you have anything to eat?’ I said, ‘I swear by Him who honored you with His Nobility and appointed you to Prophethood that it has been three days now that me, my wife and my children have not had anything to eat.’ He (MGB) looked at Fatimah (MGB) and said, ‘Go into the room and see if there is anything to eat there?’ She (MGB) said, ‘I have just come out of there now. There is nothing there to eat.’ I said, ‘O Prophet of God! Should I go?’ He (MGB) said, ‘Go in the Name of God.’ So I went in and saw that there was a tray of fresh dates in the middle of the room and a bowl of crumbled bread next to it. I brought them to God’s Prophet (MGB). The Prophet (MGB) said, ‘O Ali! Did you see the one who brought this food?’ I said, ‘Yes, I did.’ The Prophet (MGB) said, ‘Can you describe him for me.’ I said, ‘Yes. He had some redness, greenness and yellowness.’ The Prophet (MGB) said, ‘These are the colors of Gabriel’s wings which have tassels made of pearls and rubies.’ We ate from the crumbled bread in broth until we became full. Yet our hands were perfectly clean and there was nothing in them except the lines of our palm and our fingers. Thus, the Honorable the Exalted God honored only me with this Generosity from amongst the companions of the Prophet.49- The Blessed the Sublime God appointed His Prophet (MGB) to the Prophethood mission and His Prophet (MGB) appointed me to the mission of Trusteeship. Anybody who loves me is fortunate and will be united amongst the Prophets on the Resurrection Day.50- Indeed God’s Prophet (MGB) sent Abu Bakr to propagate the Chapter Bara’at (Declaration of Immunity). Once he left, Gabriel (MGB) came down and said, ‘O Muhammad! Only someone who is from yourself should propagate this chapter.’ Then the Prophet (MGB) sent me on his own camel which was called Kaswa. I found Abu Bakr in Zilhalifa and took that chapter from him. Indeed God honored me in this way.51- On the day of Qadir Khum God’s Prophet (MGB) appointed me as the Master of all the people and said, ‘Whoever I am the Master of, Ali is the Master of. May the oppressive people go far away and be destroyed.’52- Indeed God’s Prophet (MGB) said, ‘O Ali! Don’t you want me to teach you the words which Gabriel (MGB) has taught me?’ I replied, ‘O Prophet of God! Yes.’ He (MGB) said, ‘Then say ‘O the Sustainer of the poor! O the Kind to the poverty-stricken! O the Most-Hearing of those who hear! O the Most-Seeing of those who see! O the Beneficent the Merciful! Have mercy upon me and give me my share of daily bread.’53- Indeed the Blessed the Sublime God will not destroy this world until the Riser (MGB) who is from our progeny rises up. He (MGB) will kill our enemies. He (MGB) will not accept any poll-tax (Jizya). He (MGB) will break the crosses and idols. He (MGB) will end the world war, seize the possessions and divide them up equally and treat the peasants with justice.54- Indeed I heard God’s Prophet (MGB) say, ‘O Ali! Soon the Umayyads will curse you, but God’s angels will return their curse one-thousand fold. When our Riser (MGB) uprises, he (MGB) will curse them for forty years.55- God’s Prophet (MGB) said, ‘Several tribes from my nation will be tried regarding you. They will say, ‘Why has God’s Prophet (MGB) made Ali (MGB) his Trustee although he left nothing? Is not the Book of my Lord - the Glorious Quran the best things after the Honorable the Exalted God? I swear by Him who appointed me rightfully that if you do not compile the Quran, it will never be compiled.’ Thus, did the Honorable the Exalted God honor me in such a way that none of the other companions of the Prophet (MGB) have been honored.56- The Blessed the Sublime God has granted me the characteristics of those who love Him and obey Him and established me as Muhammad’s Trustee. Let this please whomever it may and dismay whomever it may.’ He was pointing at Medina with his fingers when he said this.57- God’s Prophet (MGB) faced drought in one of the battles. He (MGB) told me, ‘O Ali! Stand up to that rock and say, ‘I am the messenger of God’s Prophet’s! Give me water.’ I swear by Him who honored the Prophet (MGB) with Prophethood that once I delivered this message to that rock, there appeared several cow’s and water flowed out of each nipple. When I saw this I rushed to the Prophet (MGB) and reported it. He (MGB) said, ‘O Ali! Go and fetch water from them.’ I went there and other people also came and filled their water-skins with water, fed their quadrupeds, drank themselves and made ablutions. Thus, the Honorable the Exalted God has honored me in such a way that none of the other companions of the Prophet (MGB) have been honored.58- Water became scarce in one of the battles. God’s Prophet (MGB) told me, ‘O Ali! Bring a bowl.’ I brought a bowl to him. Then he (MGB) placed his right hand along with my hand in the bowl and said, ‘Give water!’ Water gushed out from the middle of our fingers.59- In the Battle of Khaybar God’s Prophet (MGB) sent me to conquer the castle. When I reached the door of the castle, I saw that it was closed. I shook it hard, pulled it off of its place, threw it forty steps away and entered the castle. Marhab came to fight with us. Even though two of the companions of the Prophet (MGB) fought with him and returned defeated, I fought with him. I killed him and the ground got filled with his blood.60- I killed Amr ibn ‘Abd Wudd who was as strong as a thousand men.61- I heard God’s Prophet (MGB) say, ‘O Ali! Your parable among my nation is like that of the verse, ‘Qul Huallahu Ahad. Whoever loves you wholeheartedly it is as if he has read one-third of the Quran. Anyone who loves you wholeheartedly and also helps you is like one who has read all of the Quran.’62- I accompanied God’s Prophet (MGB) everywhere and was with him in all the battles. His flag was in my hand.63- I never fled from the battlefield, killed everyone who fought with me, and filled the Earth with their blood.64- They brought a roasted heavenly chicken for the Prophet (MGB) from Paradise. He (MGB) asked God to bring the most beloved of his people there. Then the Honorable the Exalted God granted me the Grace to go there and share that chicken with the Prophet (MGB).65- I was praying in the mosque when a beggar came and asked for something. I gave him my ring which was on my finger. Then the Blessed the Sublime God revealed the following verse, ‘Your (real) friends are (no less than) Allah, His Messenger, and the (fellowship of) believers,- those who establish regular prayers and regular charity, and they bow down humbly (in worship).’66- The Blessed the Sublime God returned the Sun for me twice which He never did for anyone in the nation of Muhammad (MGB).67- God’s Prophet (MGB) call me ‘The Commander of the Faithful’ during and after his life. He never called anyone else with that title.68- God’s Prophet (MGB) told me, ‘O Ali! There shall be a call from the inside of the Throne on the Resurrection Day asking, ‘Who is the Master of the Prophets?’ Then I will step forward. Then there will be a call asking, ‘Who is the Master of the Trustees?’ and you will step forward. Then Rizvan shall bring me the keys to Paradise, and Malik shall bring me the keys to Hell. They will say, ‘God - may His Majesty be Exalted - has ordered us to bring you these keys so that you may hand them over to Ali ibn Abi Talib.’ O Ali! You will be the Qasim or the one who divides up Paradise and Hell.’69- Indeed I heard God’s Prophet (MGB) say, ‘O Ali! Were it not for you, the believers could not be distinguished from hypocrites.’70- Indeed God’s Prophet (MGB) put me, my wife Fatimah (MGB) and our two sons Al-Hassan (MGB) and Al-Hussein (MGB) under a cloak and the Blessed the Sublime God revealed the following verse, ‘…And Allah only wishes to remove all abomination from you, ye members of the Family, and to make you pure and spotless.’ Gabriel (MGB) said, ‘O Muhammad! I am also with you.’ Thus, Gabriel became the sixth of us."

Whoever fasts for three days during the month of Sha’ban and continues on fasting into the month of Ramazan, God will record the reward of fasting for two consecutive months.”"

I asked, ‘O my friend Gabriel! As happy as you are please tell me what you have to say so that I know what the place of my brother andcousin Ali ibn Abi Talib (MGB) is in God’s presence?’ Gabriel said, ‘I promise by Him who appointed you to the Prophethood and chose you for that mission that I have only descended down to the Earth for that very same issue. O Muhammad! The Sublime God sends greetings to both of you and says, ‘Muhammad is the Prophet of My Mercy and Ali is the Upholder of My Proof. I will not torture anyone who loves Ali even if he commits sins, and I will not have mercy upon Ali’s enemies even if they obey Me.’”Ibn Abbas added that God’s Prophet (MGB) said, “When the Resurrection Day comes, Gabriel will come to my presence with the Flag of Praise (‘Leva ul-Hamd) which has seventy long narrow pieces each of which is wider than the Sun and the Moon. He will come to me when I am sitting on one of the chairs in Paradise atop one of the many sacred pulpits. I will take the flag and entrust it to Ali ibn Abi Talib.” Then Umar ibn Khat’tab jumped from his place and said, “O Prophet of God! How could Ali stand to hold it with it having seventy pieces each of which is wider than the Sun and the Moon?” Then the Prophet (MGB) replied, “When the Resurrection day comes God will grant Ali (MGB) powers similar to the powers of Gabriel, light similar to the light of Adam, patience similar to the patience of Paradise, beauty similar to the beauty of Joseph, a good voice like the voice of David. Were it not that David is going to be the speaker of Paradise, God would have given David’s voice to Ali (MGB). Indeed Ali will be the first person to drink from the fresh cool water (Salsabil) and ginger (Zanjebil) Pool. When Ali takes one step on the Bridge, his other foot will be held firmly on it. There is such a position and rank for Ali and His followers in God’s presence that the people of the past and the people of the latter times would envy.”"

Then the Honorable the Exalted God would reveal to Gabriel to go to His servant and take him out (of Hell). Then Gabriel would ask, ‘O my Lord! How can I descend into Hell?’ God would say, ‘I shall make the fire cool and (a means of) safety for you.’ Gabriel would ask, ‘O my Lord! I do not know where he is?’ God would say, ‘He is imprisoned in a pit.’ Gabriel would cover up his face, descend into Hell and pull him out.Then the Honorable the Exalted God would say, ‘O My servant!

They are not required to attend the Friday or the congregational prayers. Women are not required to visit the ill, nor are they required to attend funeral processions. Women are not required to say the Takbirs aloud nor are they required to run between the Saffa and the Marva hills in Mecca. Women are not required to kiss the Black Stone nor are they required to enter the Ka’ba. Women are not required to shave their heads. Rather, they may shorten their hair. Women should not be in charge of the position of the judge nor should they be in charge of leadership or counselor. Women should not slaughter unless at times of necessity. Women should start to make ablutions by washing from the interior part of the hand while men should wash the exterior part. Women are not required to wash their feet and head as men do when making ablutions. Rather, they should uncover their head for washing their hair as part of the ablutions for prayer for the morning and evening prayers, and only put their hands under their veils to wet their hair for making ablutions for other prayers. When women stand up to say their prayers they should put the two feet together and stick their upper arms to their breast. They should stick their two hands to their thighs whenbowing down. When they want to go to the position of prostration, they should sit down first and then they should stick to the ground when they prostrate. When they lift their head up from prostration, they should first sit down and then attempt to stand up. When they sit down to say the Tashahhud, they should stick their thighs together. Women should count the glorifications which they say using their fingers since they are responsible. When women want to ask the Honorable the Exalted God for something, they can go to the roof of their house, say two units of prayers, and raise their head up towards the sky. Once they do that the Honorable the Exalted God would not turn them down and fulfill their needs. Women are not required to perform the Friday ritual ablutions (wuzu) while they are on a journey. However, they should not abandon it when they are in their homeland. Women cannot be relied upon as witnesses in any issues punishable by religious law . Women cannot be relied upon as witnesses in issues regarding divorce or seeing the new moon. However, they could be relied upon as witnesses in other affairs in which men are not allowed to investigate by looking (such as the issue of menstruation or virginity). Women should not walk in the middle of the walkways. Rather they should walk on the sides. Women are not allowed to settle in the upper chambers over-looking the roads. It is not necessary for women to learn how to write. It is good for them to learn wheel-spinning and the Chapter Nur. It is not advisable for them to learn the Chapter Yusuf. If a woman commits apostasy and renunciates her religious faith, then she should be asked to repent. It would be fine if she repents. However, if she doesn’t accept to repent, then she should be held in custody. She should not be killed as men of a similar status should be. She should be forced to work hard in prison and given minimal nourishment of food and water. She should be given rough clothes to wear and beaten up until she prays and fasts. Women are not required to pay the Jizya (the poll-tax ). Other women should be asked to leave the room when the time for giving birth to a child arrives for a woman, so that they do not unnecessarily look at her private parts. It is not proper for women who are menstruating or impure due to sex be present when a dead person is being dictated to (Talqin) since the angels would be disturbed. It is also not proper for such women to place the dead in the grave. A man should not sit at the place where a woman has been sitting before some time passes by, and that place is no longer warm due to her sitting there.The holy war for a woman is to take good care of her husband. A woman’s husband has the most rights incumbent upon her than anyone else. A woman’s husband is the best person to say prayers upon her (his wife) deadbody. It is not allowed for a Muslim woman to become naked in front of a Jewish or Christian woman, because they may describe her looks for their husbands. A woman is not allowed to put on perfume when she leaves home. It is not allowed for a woman to make herself look like men, since God’s Prophet (MGB) has cursed men who make themselves up to look like women and women who make themselves up to look like men. A woman should not remain without an adornment even if it be just a string which she wears on her neck. A woman should not leave her fingers plain white and should at least dye them with henna . However, a woman should not dye her hands while she is menstruating since there is the fear that Satan may bother her. When a woman has a need during her prayers she should clap her hands together. However, when a man needs something during his prayers he can point at it with his head and hand and say God’s glorifications. A woman is not allowed to pray without a veil except for a female slave who can say her prayers without a veil. Women are allowed to put on fine silk and heavy brocade clothes when they are not praying or not in a state of ritual consecration wearing the Ihram. However, men are forbidden to do so unless they are attending a holy war. Women are allowed to wear gold rings and pray with them on. However, men are forbidden to do so (unless they are attending a holy war).The Prophet (MGB) said, ‘O Ali! Do not wear gold since that is what will be your adornment in Paradise. Do not wear silk clothes since that will be your clothes in Paradise.’ A woman is not allowed to give charity of free her own slaves unless with her husband’s permission. A woman is not allowed to fast the recommendable fasts unless with her husband’s permission. A woman is not allowed to shake hands with unfamiliar men unless her hands are covered up. A woman is not allowed to make pledge of allegiance with her hands unless her hands are covered up. A woman is not allowed to go to recommendable Hajj without her husband’s permission. A woman should not go to a bath house since this if forbidden for her. A woman should not ride on a saddle unless it is absolutely necessary or on a trip. A woman’s inheritance will be half of that of a man. The blood money for a woman will be half of that of a man. In retribution for injury to, or loss of, bodily organs men and women shall be treated equally unless the blood money for the lost organ is a third or more than a third of the full blood money, in which case a woman’s blood money shall be half of a man’s.When a woman stands to pray alone with a man she should stand up behind him not by his side.When a woman dies they should pray for her while standing at her chest whereas when a man dies they should pray for him while standing at his head. When they place a woman in the grave her husband should stand in a place from which he can take her thighs and bury her. There will be no intercession on behalf of a woman with her Lord unless her husband is pleased with her.When Fatimah (MGB) passed away, the Commander of the Faithful (MGB) stood up next to her and said, ‘O God!

Imam as-Sadiq (MGB) said, “Get to know intelligence and its troops, and ignorance and its troops to be guided.” Soma’at said, “O! May I be your devoted servant. We know nothing except for what you teach us.” Imam as-Sadiq (MGB) said, “God, Exalted is His Praise created the intellect. It was one of His first creatures which He created using His own Light from the right side of the Throne. Then He ordered it to go back, and it did. Then He ordered it to come forward, and it did. God said, “I created you as a great creature, and honored you above all My creatures.” Then God created ignorance and told it to go back and it did. Then God ordered it to come forward, but it did not accept. God said, “You rebelled.” Then God cursed it. God then established seventy-five troops for the intellect. When ignorance saw God’s grant to the intellect, it became its enemy and said, “O’ God! You created it and honored it and strengthened it. It is a creature like me. I am opposed to it and have no power over it. So please grant me of the troops you grant it.” God said, “Ok I will, but if you disobey I will throw you and your troops out of the domain of My Mercy.” Ignorance said it was pleased, and it was also granted seventy-five troops.

All the characteristics which are the troops of the intellect will only be present in the Prophet (MGB) or the Imams (MGB) or a believer who has tested his heart with faith. However, other friends of ours have some of these and can slowly attain the rest and avoid the troops of ignorance. Then they will reach the high ranks of the Prophets and the Imams. This prosperity is only obtained by the recognition of the intellect and its troops, and by avoiding ignorance and its troops. May God assist both you and us in obeying and pleasing Him.”"

They asked the Muslims, ‘Has there come a Prophet in Tahameh who considers the Jewish people to be light-headed and admonishes them against their religion? We are worried that he may turn us away from the religion of our forefathers. Which one of you is that Prophet? If he turns out to be the one whom David (MGB) has previously given us glad tidings of his coming, we will believe in and follow him. However, if he turns out to be just an eloquent speaker who uses poetry and convinces the people with his talks, we will fight with him with our lives and property. Where is this Prophet?’The Emigrants (Muhajerin) and their Helpers (Ansar) all said, ‘The Prophet (MGB) has passed away.’ The two Jewish men praised God for hearing the news of the death of the Prophet. Then they asked, ‘Each Prophet (MGB) has a Trustee whom is in charge of religious duties after him. Which one of you is his Trustee?’ The Emigrants (Muhajerin) and their Helpers (Ansar) all faced Abu Bakr and said, ‘He is his Trustee.’ The Jewish men told Abu Bakr, ‘We will ask you some questions which should be asked from the Trustees. Please respond to them if you are the Trustee.’ Abu Bakr said, ‘Fine. Go ahead and ask. God willing I will respond.’ One ofthem asked, ‘What are you and I considered to be before the Honorable the Exalted God? What is the living creature which was placed in another living creature without there being any ties of kinship between them? Which grave was the one which took what it contained on a trip? From where does the Sun rise? To where does the Sun set? Where was that place upon which the Sun shone only once and never again? Where is Paradise? Where is Hell? Does your God carry loads or does He become loaded? To which direction does your God face? Who are the two things that are always present? What are the two things that are always absent? What are the two things which cannot both be at once? Who is the one? Who are the two? What are the three? What are the four? What are the five? What are the six? What are the seven? What are the eight? What are the nine? What are the ten? What are the eleven? What are the twelve? What are the twenty? What are the thirty? What are the forty? What are the fifty? What are the sixty? What are the seventy? What are the eighty? What are the ninety? What are the one-hundred?’”Ibn Abbas added, “Abu Bakr could not answer. We became frightened that the people might turn away from the religion. I went to see Ali ibn Abi Talib (MGB) and told him, ‘O Ali! Some of the Jewish chiefs have come to Medina. They met Abu Bakr and asked him some questions, but Abu Bakr was unable to respond.’ Ali (MGB) smiled and said, ‘This is the day which the Prophet of God (MGB) had foretold.’ Then Ali (MGB) walked ahead of me just as the Prophet (MGB) did and sat in the Prophet’s place. He requested the two Jewish men, ‘Come to me and present to me the questions which you asked this old man.’ The two Jews asked, ‘Who are you?’ He (MGB) replied, ‘I am Ali Ibn Abi Talib - the brother of the Prophet (MGB), the husband of Fatimah, the father of Hassan and Hussein, the Prophet’s Trustee in all issues, and the one who knows all of the Prophet’s secrets.’ One of the two Jews asked, ‘What are you and I considered to be before the Honorable the Exalted God?’ Ali (MGB) replied, ‘I have been a believer since I have known myself, and you have been an unbeliever since you have known yourself. I do not know about your destiny in the future.’"

Everything is established upon the Earth and the Earth is established upon God’s Power and it is indeed His Power which bears everything.’The Jew asked, ‘Where is Paradise?

Then he (MGB) asked the Jew, ‘To which direction does this fire face?’ The Jew said, ‘It doesn’t face any specific direction.’ Ali (MGB) said, ‘This is similar to the case of the Honorable the Exalted God. To Him belong both the East and the West.

When Adam’s time of death arrived, he denied it. It was from then on that that denying the truth passed on from him unto his progeny.’ The Jew said, ‘O young fellow! Please describe Muhammad for me as if I am looking at him myself so that I may believe in him.’ The Commander of the Faithful Imam Ali (MGB) cried and said, ‘O Jew! You have renewed my sorrow. My friend Muhammad - the Prophet of God - was a large-foreheaded man; with joined brows; black eyes; smooth cheeks; a cute nose; tiny lips; dense beard; shiny teeth; with a silver color neck; and a line of hair from the throat down to his belly button like a camphor branch with no hair elsewhere. He was neither too tall nor too short. When he walked his light encompassed everyone around him: he walked firmly as if he was climbing a hill or going down a hill; He had round heels, delicate feet and a thin waist. His turban was As-Sahab; his sword Dhul Fiqar ; his mule was Doldol ; his donkey was Ya’fur; his camel was Kaswa; his horse was Lizaz; and his staff was al-Mamshuq. He (MGB) was the kindest person with other people. He (MGB) was the most gentle person with other people. The seal of Prophethood was placed between his two shoulders. There were two lines written on that seal. The first line read, ‘There is no god but God’ and the second line read, ‘Muhammad is the Prophet of God. Well. Dear Jewish fellow! These were his characteristics.’ The two Jewish men said, ‘We bear witness that there is no god but God; Muhammad is the Prophet of God; and you are the Trustee of Muhammad.’ They became true Muslims and became companions of Ali (MGB). They were with him (MGB) until the Battle of Jamal when they accompanied Ali (MGB) to Basra. One of them was killed there and the other one survived until he accompanied Ali (MGB) in the Battle of Siffin and was killed in that battle.”"

Go to see Ali ibn Abi Talib.’ The Jews went to see Ali (MGB) and told him what had happened while they held the Torah open in their hand.

These are a total of seventeen units of prayers. The recommendable (supererogatory) prayers consist of thirty-four units. Four units are to be said after the evening prayer, but are omitted while on a journey or in a state of fear. Two units that are to be said while sitting after the night prayer - though they are considered to be one unit. Eight units are the night prayers to be said at dawn. Two units - even (Al-Shaf’a) and one unit - odd (Al-Vatr) are to be said in the morning, and two units for the morning prayer to be said after the one odd unit. Eight units are to be said before the noon prayer, and eight units are to be said before the afternoon prayer. Prayers said at the onset of their established times are nobler. The reward for congregational prayers is twenty-four times that of individual prayers. Do not pray behind a sinful congregational prayer leader. Pray only behind congregational prayer leaders who believe in Divine Leadership . Do not pray while you are wearing the skins of a dead animal , even if it has been tanned seventy times. Do not pray while you are wearing skins of beasts. Do not prostrate on anything but the Earth, or what grows on it except for what is edible, cotton and linen . In the opening of the prayer you should say, ‘Ta’ala arshak. It is not permitted to say “Ta’ala jaddak.’ It is not permitted to say “As-salamu alaina va ala ebadillah is-saleheen” in the first Tashahhud of the prayer since saying so implies termination of the prayer, and once you say that your prayer ends. Shortening the prayers is valid after you travel eight Farsakhs (round trip) or four Farsakhs away from your home - that is two way-stops. When prayers are shortened while on a journey, fasting should be broken. It is not acceptable not to shorten the prayers while you are on a journey, since that is similar to adding on something to what God has prescribed.Qunut in all the obligatory prayers should be said before bowing down and after reciting the (required) verse (of the Holy Quran) in the second unit of the prayer.There are five times of saying God is Great required in funeral prayers. Whoever says it fewer times has opposed the tradition. When the corpse of a man is being put into the grave, they should deliver it slowly with its feet going in first. But when the corpse of a woman is being put into the grave, they should deliver it from her head going in first. Graves should be leveled. Their surfaces should not be tilted.One should say - ‘In the Name of God’ - aloud in his prayers. There are seven requirements for prayer. They are: the proper time; ablutions; attentiveness; the proper direction (or the Qibla), bowing down; prostration; and supplications.The obligatory alms-tax on Dirhams (silver money) is five Dirhams if it reaches a total of two-hundred Dirhams. And if the quantity of silver doesn’t reach the aforesaid amount, it is not obligatory to pay any alms-tax on it. It is not obligatory to pay any alms-taxes, unless one whole year is passed from the time of ownership. Alms-tax should only be paid to the needy ones who are followers of the Divine Mastery and Divine Recognition. One should pay alms-tax on gold when gold reaches twenty mithqals (one mithqal being equal to 3.456 grams). Then the amount of alms-tax to be paid is one-half a Dinar. One should pay alms-tax on wheat, barley, dates and raisins when they reach the amount of five Wasq . The alms-tax would be one-tenth of it if it is irrigated by rain water and it would be one-twentieth of it if it has been irrigated by a well. Each Wasq equals four as-Sa’s while each as-Sa equals four mad’s. One should pay alms-tax on sheep when the number he owns reaches forty-one. Then one sheep should be given as alms. If they reach one-hundred and twenty-one in number, one should give two sheep as alms. If they reach two-hundred and one in number, one should give three sheep as alms. If they reach three-hundred and one in number, one should give four sheep as alms. For each one-hundred more sheep one should give another sheep as alms.One should pay alms-tax on cows when the number he owns reaches thirty. Then a one-year old cow should be given as alms. If they reach forty in number, he should give a female calf which has entered its third year of life as alms. If they reach sixty in number, he should give two calves which have entered the second year of their life. If they reach ninety in number, he should give three calves which have entered their second year of life as alms. And similarly, as the number of the cows increases, he should calculate either in thirties or in forties or from thirty and forty, and should pay the alms in accordance with the rule explained above.One should pay alms-tax on camels when the number he owns reaches five. Then one sheep should be given as alms. When the number of camels he owns reaches ten he should give two sheep as alms. When the number of camels he owns reaches fifteen he should give three sheep as alms. When the number of camels he owns reaches twenty he should give four sheep as alms. When the number of camels he owns reaches twenty-five he should give five sheep as alms. When the number of camels he owns is one more - that is it reaches twenty-six, then he should give a camel that has entered its second year of life as alms. When the number of camels he owns reaches thirty-five and a new one is added - that is it reaches thirty-six, then he should give a camel that has entered its third year of life as alms.When the number of camels he owns reaches forty-five and a new one is added - that is it reaches forty-six, then he should give a camel that has entered its fourth year of life as alms. When the number of camels he owns reaches sixty and a new one is added - that is it reaches sixty-one, then he should give a camel that has entered its fifth year of life as alms. When the number of camels he owns reaches seventy-five and a new one is added - that is it reaches seventy-six, then he should give two camels that have entered their third year of life as alms. When the number of camels he owns reaches ninety and a new one is added - that is it reaches ninety-one, then he should give two camels that have entered their fourth year of life as alms. When the number of camels he owns reaches ninety and a new one is added - that is it reaches ninety-one, then he should give two camels that have entered their fourth year of life as alms. If the number of camels he owns reaches one-hundred and twenty-one camels and above, he should either calculate the camels on group of forty each, and give for each set of forty camels a camel which has entered the third year of its life as alms; or calculate them on groups of fifty each and give for every fifty camels, a camel which has entered the fourth year of its life as alms, or he may calculate them in the groups of forty and fifty. Payment of the alms-tax for fasting is obligatory for everyone, whether they are young or old; free or a slave; male or female. It equals four handfuls of wheat, barley, dates and raisin. That is a whole grain dry measure being called one ‘as-Sa. This should be given to the needy ones who are followers of the Divine Mastery and Divine Recognition.”"

A semi-menstruating woman should use cotton pads and perform the ritual bathing before she performs any prayers. The menstruating woman quits saying her prayers, and doesn’t have to make up the prayers that she misses during her period of menstruation. She quits fasting, however, she should make up for the days of fasting that she misses. Fasting should be observed during the (Arabic) month of Ramazan only when the new moon is seen, and should be stopped when the new moon (of the next month) is seen. It is invalid to offer the recommendable prayers in congregations as this would be an innovation (in religion). All innovations in religion result in our loss and we end up in the Fire. It is a recommendable tradition to fast during three days of every month: two Thursdays with a Wednesday in between. The first Thursday would be during the first ten days. The Wednesday would be during the middle ten days, and the next Thursday would be during the last ten days of the month. It is recommendable for anyone who can fast, to fast during the (Arabic) month of Sha’ban because good people fast or wish to fast during that month. God’s Prophet ﷺ fasted during the two months of Sha’ban and Ramazan. It is acceptable to make up the missed days of fasting of Ramazan in different days, but it would be better if you could make them up successively. The performance of the Hajj pilgrimage to the Ka’aba is obligatory upon everyone who has the ability to do so. This ability applies to the provisions for the expenses for the trip (to Mecca), the means to take the trip (riding on an animal, by vehicle, or by airplane), healthiness, maintenance to be left for one’s household and the provisions for returning from Mecca to one’s homeland. Any form of Hajj except for that of Tamatu' Hajj is not allowed (except for the people of Mecca and those present there.) It is also not allowed to opt for Hajj Ifra’ad or Hajj Al-Kiran except for the people who live around the Al-Haram Mosque. Entering the state of ritual consecration (or wearing Ihram ) is not allowed before reaching the miqat. It is also not allowed to put off entering the state of ritual consecration after reaching the miqat unless it be due to illness or concealing faith. The Sublime God says, “And complete the Hajj or Umra in the service of God…” What is meant by ‘complete the Hajj’ in this verse is not sleeping with one’s spouse, not telling lies and not fighting. It is not allowed to offer a castrate sheep for sacrifice because it is imperfect. It is permissible to offer for sacrifice a sheep with damaged testicles only if you cannot get any others. The following are the obligatory acts during the Hajj pilgrimage: the state of ritual consecration (Ihram), Talbiyah that is saying: (Here I am, O Allah, at Thy service. Here I am, Thou art without partner, here I am. All Praise and blessings are thine, and Dominion! Thou art without partner!)’And circumambulating around the Ka’ba during the Umra (supererogatory) pilgrimage is obligatory. And saying two units of prayer at the Station of Abraham is obligatory. Walking between Safa and Marva is obligatory. Circumambulation of the Hajj is obligatory. Saying two units of prayers at the Station is obligatory. Then walking between Safa and Marva is obligatory. The Al-Nisa Circumambulation is obligatory. Saying two units of prayers at the Station is obligatory. There is no more walking between Safa and Marva. Stopping at the Mash’ar (Sacred Monument) is obligatory. Offering for sacrifice is obligatory for anyone who goes on the Tamatu Hajj. Staying in Arafat is obligatory. And cutting the hair is a tradition. Stoning at the Devil (Jamrah) is a tradition. ”Jihad (the Holy War) is obligatory only under the leadership of a just leader. Whoever gets killed for defending his wealth is considered to be a martyr. It is not allowed to kill any atheists or imposters during their concealment of the faith, except for murderers or aggressors who cause corruption; and only when you have no fear for the safety of yourself and your companions guaranteed from the aftermath. The concealment of faith is obligatory when needed. There is no expiation for telling lies in order to fend off oppression from oneself as a part of concealment of faith. Divorce is valid only when it is implemented according to Islamic laws that the Honorable the Exalted God mentioned in His Book, or according to the tradition of the Prophet ﷺ. Any other form of divorce is invalid, including the forms that oppose the Book. Similarly, any form of marriage that opposes the Book is invalid. It is not allowed for a man to marry more than four free women at the same time. You cannot re-marry your wife if you divorce her thrice, until after she marries someone else. Moreover, the Prophet ﷺ said, ‘Stay away from women who were divorced three times at once, for they are still married women.’ It is obligatory to send blessings upon the Prophet ﷺ in every situation, including when one sneezes, the blowing of the wind, and so on. It is obligatory to cherish the friends of the Sublime God and to hate and disavow their enemies who oppressed the members of the Household of Muhammad ﷺ, tore their curtain of respect; took the tract of land called Fadak away from Fatimah , withheld her inheritance from her, usurped her right and her husband’s right by force; tried to put her house on fire; established oppression; and changed the traditions of the Prophet of God ﷺ. It is obligatory to hate the perfidious party, the deviators, and the apostates. It is obligatory to hate those guilty of perjury in Jamal, oppressors in the Battle of Siffin, and those who abandoned the religion in Nahrawan. It is obligatory to hate the murderers - from the first to the last. It is obligatory to hate those who mistreated the she-camel send to the Thamud clan. It is obligatory to hate the murderer of the Commander of the Faithful . It is obligatory to hate all those who murdered the members of the Household of the Holy Prophet ﷺ. It is obligatory to love those believers who did not turn away from the religion after the demise of the Prophet ﷺ such as: Salman Farsi, Abu Dharr Ghafari, Miqdad ibn al-Aswad al-Kindi, Ammar ibn Yasser, Jabir ibn Abdullah Ansari, Hudhaifa ibn al-Yaman, Abil Haytham ibn Tayihan, Sahl ibn Hunayf, Abi Ayyub Al-Ansari, Abdullah ibn Samit, Ubada ibn Samit, Khuzayma ibn Thabit Dhul-Shahadatayn, Abi Sa’id al-Khudri, and others who followed their way and acted as they did. It is obligatory to love those who used them as their models and followed them."

However, if they are polytheists, do not obey either of them nor anyone else regarding sins, because there is no necessity to obey people by disobeying the Creator! The Prophets and their Trustees never commit any sins, since they are sinless and innocent.The two temporary issues which the Prophet established are both legitimate since the Honorable the Exalted God revealed them in His Book and God’s Prophet practiced them. They are the temporary Hajj or Mutat al-Hajj and the temporary marriage with women that is Mutat al-Nisa. The inheritance laws are as ordained by the Blessed the Sublime God. Boys and girls should be shaved when they are seven days old. On the seventh day after their birth, they should be named, their head should be shaved and alms in the form of silver or gold equal in weight to their hair should be given as charity. The Honorable the Exalted God doesn’t place a burden on anyone more than he/she can bear.God has measured the servants (people’s) voluntary acts but he has not established them. God is the creator of everything. There is neither authorization, nor predestination. (Rather there is something in between.) The Honorable the Exalted God would not call to account an innocent person for the deeds of a sinful person. The Honorable the Exalted God would not punish a child for the crimes committed by his father as He has said in His strong Book, ‘…no bearer of burdens can bear the burden of another…’The Honorable the Exalted God has also said, ‘That man can have nothing but what he strives for; That (the fruit of) his striving will soon come in sight:’The Honorable the Exalted God forgives and grant favors. The Honorable the Exalted God would not oppress. The Honorable the Exalted God has not demanded His servants to obey an oppressor whom God knows would fool and oppress you. God would not chose as a Messenger or appoint as a Prophet one whom He knows to be an unbeliever and has chosen the servitude of Satan instead of God’s servitude. God would not establish anyone as His Proof unless he is innocent and immaculate.Being Muslim is different from being Mu’min. All believers are Muslims, but all Muslims are not believers. A thief is not a believer while he is stealing. An adulterer is not a believer while he is committing adultery. Those who receive Divinely ordained punishments (are punished by religious decrees) are Muslims, but they are neither believers nor unbelievers.The Blessed the Sublime God has promised Heaven to the believers. God would not take them to Hell. God would never take unbelievers out of Hell, since He has promised to take them to Hell. God would forgive any sins other than unbelief for anyone He wishes.Those who are subjected to the Divinely ordained chastisements are neither believers, nor unbelievers. They will not stay in Hell forever. One day they will be taken out of Hell. They can benefit from intercession on their behalf. So can the oppressed people if the Honorable the Exalted God is pleased with their religion. The Quran is God’s sayings; it is neither the Creator nor the created. Today Muslim countries are considered to be Darotaqieh (that is where one must conceal his faith). They are Daroislam (home of Islam). They are neither Darolkofr (home of unbelief) nor are they Daroliman (home of faith).Enjoining good and admonishing against evil is obligatory upon whoever has the means to do so.Faith consists of performing the obligatory deeds and abstaining from the major sins. “Faith consists of whole-hearted acceptance, verbal expression, and acting accordingly. It also consists of belief in and testifying to the torture of the grave, Munkar and Nakir , Resurrection after death, the Reckoning, the Bridge , and the Balance (of Deeds). You cannot have faith unless you hate the enemies of the Honorable the Exalted God.It is obligatory to say the Takbir prior to the start of the prayers on the prayers of the two Eids. It should be said after the five prayers which begin with the night prayer of the evening of Eid ul-Azha and end with the afternoon prayer of the Eid ul-Azha. It consists of saying, “God is Great, God is Great, God is Great. There is no god but God, God is Great, God is Great, and to Him goes all gratitude and thanks.’ This is done since God has guided us since the Honorable the Exalted God said, ‘(He wants you) to complete the prescribed period, and to glorify Him in that He has guided you; and perchance ye shall be grateful.’It is obligatory to say the Takbir after the prayers on the prayers of the Eid ul-Azha. On Eid ul-Azha, in towns away from Mecca, it should be said after ten prayers which begin with the prayer before the Eid day and end with the morning prayer of the third day, while in Mina it should be said after fifteen prayers which begin with the noon prayer of the Eid day and end with the morning prayer of the fourth day . Moreover, the following should be added to the Takbir of Eid ul-Azha prayers, ‘Allah is the Greater for what He has given us from the cattle,’ at Mina.Women should not rest in childbed for more than twenty days. They may even get purified earlier than that. If you do not become purified by then you must perform the major ritual ablutions (ghusl) and act as menstruating women do.Drinking wine and anything which makes you drunk is forbidden - whether it be a little or a lot.It is forbidden to eat the meat of any beast that has a canine tooth or any bird that has claws. It is forbidden to eat the spleen since there is blood in it. It is also forbidden to eat all floating (dead) fish, eels, sheatfish , and scaleless fish. It is allowed to eat eggs whose tips are not the same, but it is forbidden to eat eggs whose tips are the same. It is allowed to eat any locusts which can fly. However, it is forbidden to eat any sea locusts which cannot fly. For fish and locust to be allowed for eating they must be caught alive."

Moreover engaging in whatever would keep one far from God’s remembrance such as singing or playing musical instruments and persisting in doing minor sins is admonished against.” Then As-Sadiq (MGB) added, “This is sufficient for the servants who are obedient.” The compiler of the book added, “There are seven absolutely major sins. However, the sins mentioned thereafter are more major than minor sins, and are less severe than the major sins. This is what As-Sadiq (MGB) intended to say by naming more than seven major sins here. There is no power save in God.”"

What he (MGB) taught is as follows.Blood-letting improves physical health and strengthens the intellect.Putting perfume on the moustache is one of the traditions of the Prophet (MGB) and of the Honorable Recorders (Kiraman Katibin) .Brushing the teeth is one of the things that pleases the Honorable the Exalted God. It is also one of the traditions of God’s Prophet (MGB). It cleans the mouth.Soap makes the cuticle soft, increases intelligence, facilitates the flow of water in the body, takes away dryness of the skin and improves the color of the face.Washing the head takes away dirtiness and cleans dust and rubbish.Gargling with water and pulling water up into the nose is a tradition. It cleans both the mouth and the nose.Drawing snuff into the nose clears up the head, cleans the body and alleviates any headaches.Applying depilatory cream or powder brings happiness and cleans the body.Keeping the shoes in proper order helps maintain the body and helps with cleanliness and prayer.Cutting the nails prevents major ailments, increases one’s sustenance and expedites the arrival of one’s share of daily bread.Shaving the underarm fights bad odor. It is a part of cleanliness and a custom which the clean Prophet (MGB) has ordered.Washing the hands before and after every meal causes an increase in one’s share of daily bread. It also prevents one’s clothes from getting oily and improves one’s sight.Staying up at night (to worship God) would improve your health, cause the pleasure of the Honorable the Exalted Lord, is a means of seeking His Mercy, and is a way of following behavior of the Prophets.Eating an apple is good for the stomach.Chewing gum would strengthen the teeth, eliminate phlegm and remove bad odor of the mouth.It is much better to sit in the mosque after dawn until sunrise than to go around and work to earn a living.Eating quinces would strengthen a weak heart, clean the stomach, improve spiritual strength, convert a scared person to a brave one, and result in the production of a better child.Eating twenty-one raisins with breakfast every morning would cure all the pains except death."

Fasting in the month of ‘Sha’ban would fight off temptations and concerns of the heart.Cleansing yourself with cold water after defecation would help prevent hemorrhoids.Washing the clothes would eliminate sadness and is a part of cleansing for prayer.You should not pull out grey hairs since they are the light of a believer.The white hair of whoever spends his youth for Islam will become his light on the Resurrection Day.A Muslim should not go to sleep while he is in a state of major impurity.A Muslim should not go to sleep until he gets cleaned. If he doesn’t have access to water, he should make ablutions with dirt since a believer’s spirit goes up to God in his sleep and the Blessed the Sublime God accepts it and blesses it. If the time of his death has come, then his spirit will be placed in the Treasury of God’s Mercy. However, if the time for his death has still not arrived, then his spirit will be returned with trusted angels and placed back in his body.A believer should not spit in the direction of the Qibla (prayer direction). Should he unintentionally do so, he should ask for forgiveness from the Honorable the Exalted God for that.You should not blow at the place of prostration.You should not blow at your food or your drink.You should not blow at your charm.You should not sleep on the passage-ways.You should not urinate in the air.You should not urinate in flowing water. Should you do so and get hurt, you have no one but yourselves to blame since there are residents in water and air.You should not sleep on your face. If you see someone sleeping on his face, wake him up and do not let him to do this again.You should not do your prayers lazily and while dozing off.You should not think about yourself while you are praying since then you are standing in the presence of your Honorable Exalted Lord. For one’s prayer to be accepted it must be said wholeheartedly.Eat whatever falls off of the table-cloth because it is the cure for every pain with the permission of the Honorable the Exalted God. He can cure anyone with it whom He Wills. When you eat a meal and lick your fingers with which you ate, the Honorable the Exalted God would says, ‘May God bless you with that.’Wear cotton clothing because it was God’s Prophet’s (MGB) clothing and it is our clothing. He never wore clothing made from animal’s hair and wool, except for a reason. For sure the Magnificent and the Exalted God is beautiful and likes to see the effect of his blessing in his servant. Be kind to your family members although it be by just greeting them. The Blessed the Sublime God says, ‘…reverence God, through whom ye demand your mutual (rights), and (reverence) the wombs (that bore you), for God ever watches over you.’Do not waste your time with vain talk or vain plans since there are certain angels which are appointed to record your deeds.Remember God everywhere since He is with you.Greet Muhammad (MGB) and his Household (MGB) so that the Honorable the Exalted God may accept your supplications through Muhammad’s remembrance and supplicating for him (MGB).Let your hot food cool down before you eat it since God’s Prophet (MGB) said, ‘Whenever they bring you hot food, let it cool down before you eat it. The Honorable the Exalted God doesn’t wish us to eat hot food. There are blessings in cooled food.’You should not urinate in the air or in the wind.You should teach your children things by which they may earn Godly benefits, so that they may not be taught erroneous beliefs by others.Watch your tongue and greet the people politely.Return what you are entrusted with to its possessor, even if he may be the murderer of the Prophet’s offspring (MGB).Whenever you enter a market and see that the people are busy doing their own affairs you should remember God as that would constitute an atonement for your sins and an increase in your good deeds. Thus, your name will not be recorded along with the ignorant ones.You should not travel when the month of fasting comes because God said, ‘… So everyone of you who is present (in his home) during that month should spend it in fasting…’There is no concealment of faith regarding drinking alcoholic beverages and washing the feet from over the foot-wear ."

You should say that we are servants of God, but you may state our virtues.Whoever loves us should act as we do. You should seek the assistance of piety, since it is the best assistant in the affairs of this world and the Hereafter.Do not associate with those who try to find fault with us. Do not praise us in front of our enemies. Do not express our love publicly, since then you may become despised by the kings.Adhere to righteousness since it will save you.Be inclined to what is near the Honorable the Exalted God. Try to obey God. Persevere in obeying God.How awkward would it be for a believer to enter Paradise without dignity.You should not just be hopeful of our intercession on your behalf on the Resurrection Day. You should make an effort yourself to do good deeds.You should not disgrace yourself in front of your enemies in the Hereafter. You should not deny your own rank near God in front of your enemies for this lowly world.You should forget about trying to get what others own due to God’s commands. Have you not heard that God’s Prophet (MGB) has informed us that what is near God is better and more permanent. Should a believer receive the glad tidings from the Honorable the Exalted God, he would be delighted and interested in visiting God.Do not belittle your weak brethren. The Honorable the Exalted God will not unite whoever belittles a believer with that believer in Heaven, unless he repents. You should help fulfill the needs of your brethren as soon as you realize that he needs something before he asks. Be friends for each other. Be kind to each other. Give gifts to one another. Do not be like a hypocrite who says something, but doesn’t act accordingly.Get married as this is a tradition of God’s Prophet (MGB). He (MGB) said, ‘Whoever likes to follow my traditions should get married, since getting married is one of my traditions.’ You should also try to have children, since then your large nation will be proud in the Hereafter.You should not feed your babies with an adulterer’s milk or an insane woman’s milk, since milk could transfer a mother’s illness to the child. You should not eat any birds which do not have a gizzard, a spur on its feet, or a craw . You should not eat any wild animals that have canine teeth and or birds that have claws. You should not eat a spleen since it spoils the blood. You should not wear black clothes since that was how Pharaoh dressed. You should not eat any meat glands since this may cause leprosy. You should not make comparisons regarding religious affairs as that doesn’t hold. Those who do so are the enemies of the religion. It was Satan who did so first.Do not wear rectangular shoes since Pharaoh’s shoes were that way. Pharaoh was the first person who wore such shoes.You should oppose wine-drinkers. I advise you to eat dates since they are the cure of every pain. You should obey the sayings of God’s Prophet (MGB) who said, ‘God will open a door of poverty to anyone who opens up the door of a question to himself. ’ You should ask God for forgiveness often, since that would expedite the arrival of your daily sustenance. You should rush to do good deeds, so that you may benefit from them in the Hereafter.I admonish you against arguing because it causes doubt. If you have any needs from the Honorable the Exalted Lord, you should choose any of the following three times to ask Him for it: sometime on Fridays; at the time of sunset; when the wind blows - that is at times when the gates of Heaven are opened and Mercy descends; when the birds sing and at the last hours of night when the dawn comes at which time two angels announce, ‘Is there anyone who repents whose repentance is accepted of him? Is there anyone begging for anything so that it be granted to him? Is there anyone asking for forgiveness so that he be forgiven? Is there anyone asking for anything to be given to him?’ and one responds, ‘Yes. Here I am! I am responding to the Supreme God’s invitation.’Ask (God) for your share of daily bread from dawn until sunrise. This would be better than going around after work, since this is the time at which God divides his servants’ share of daily bread."

Do not lose hopes in God’s Mercy. The best deed in the sight of the Honorable the Exalted God is being hopeful for relief so that one can survive with that hope.You should seek God’s help by reliance on Him when you say your morning prayers, since that is the time when the rewards are bestowed.Do not enter a shrine with a sword.You should not put the sword in front of you while you pray, since the Qibla (prayer direction) is a secure turning point.Whenever you go on the Hajj pilgrimage, you should also go and visit the shrine of God’s Prophet (MGB). It would be ungrateful not to do so.You should also visit other shrines which the Honorable the Exalted God has made it incumbent upon you to visit. You should ask for your share of daily bread there.Do not underestimate minor sins since they might lead to major sins.Lengthen your prostration because nothing is harsher for Satan to bear than to see the prostration of man, since Satan was ordered to prostrate but he disobeyed and man was ordered to prostrate and he obeyed and was saved.You should often remember death and your departure from the grave and standing up in front of God so that difficulties become easy for you.Whenever you get a pain in the eye you should recite the verse of the Throne (Ayat al-Kursi) hoping that you get better if God wills. I advise you to abstain from committing sins since any calamities, restrictions in your share of the daily bread, scratches, or bruises are due to committing sins.The Honorable the Exalted God said, ‘Whatever misfortune happens to you, is because on the things your hands have wrought, and for many (of them) He grants forgiveness.’ You should often remember God when you eat food. You should not rebel since the food is also one of God’s blessings, and it is a part of your daily bread. It is incumbent upon you to thank and praise God for it.It would be better if you are grateful for the blessings when you get them and before they are gone. Blessings will testify as to how their owner treated them.God would be pleased with a little bit of good deeds of anyone who is pleased with a little bit of daily bread from God.I admonish you against immoderation as it will result in regret when there is no use in regret.When you are in the battlefield and you encounter your enemies, you should talk less and remember God a lot. You should not flee since then you will face God’s Wrath. When you encounter your wounded brethren you should rescue them. You should do as many good deeds as you can so as to be saved from a bad death.If you wish to know about your rank in the sight of God, you should consider God’s rank in your sight when you are committing sins. This would be your rank in the sight of the Blessed the Sublime God.The best thing you can get in your house for your wife is a sheep. The angels would sanctify you once a day, if you have one sheep in your house. They would sanctify you twice a day if you have two sheep in your house. They would sanctify you three times, if you have three sheep in your house.Whenever a Muslim gets weak, he should eat meat and dairy products since the Honorable the Exalted God has placed strength in them.Whenever you decide to go on the Hajj pilgrimage, you should prepare for the trip in advance as the Honorable the Exalted God says, ‘If they had intended to come out, they would certainly have made some preparation.’"

Please forgive those sins that your guards have recorded and I have forgotten’, since it is on the Honorable the Exalted God to forgive the sins of those who confess to their sins there, count them, remember them and ask God for forgiveness.Say supplications before calamities fall upon you.The gate to heavens open at five times: when it rains; when the holy warriors attack; during the recitation of the azan , when the Quran is recited; at sunset and at sunrise.Whoever performs the major ritual ablutions for the deceased should perform the major ritual ablutions himself after he shrouds the corpse.Do not put any perfumes on the corpse except for camphor, since a dead person is considered to be intimate .You should advise your folks to speak fairly about the dead ones, since when the father of Fatimah (MGB) died and all of the Hashemite women mourned in sympathizing with her, Fatimah (MGB) called them all in and said, ‘I invite you not to mourn and cry, but to say supplications.’Visit the graves of relatives since they become happy when you visit them.You should supplicate upon your parents’ graves and ask God for the fulfillment of your needs after what you ask of God for them.A Muslim should act like a mirror for his Muslim brethren .Whenever you notice a slippage or fault from your believing brother, you should not attack him. You should be kind to him, advise him and guide him.Avoid disputes so that you are not scattered about.I advise you to be moderate so that you may make progress.Whenever you reach your destination after having ridden a quadruped you should first give it some water and grass.You should not beat quadrupeds on the face since they glorify their Lord.Whenever you get lost and frightened while you are traveling, you should say, ‘Ya Salih Aqsani’, since one of your genie brothers called Salih is always moving around and would help you find your way and would stop a fleeing quadruped upon hearing your call.Whenever you are frightened for yourself or your sheep from a lion, you should draw a line around yourself and say, ‘O God! O Creator of Daniel and the den , Lord of all the lions! Please protect me and my sheep.’Whenever you become frightened by a scorpion you should recite the verses: ‘Peace and salutation to Noah among the nations! Thus indeed do we reward those who do right. For he was one of our believing Servants.’Whenever you get frightened from becoming drowned you should read ‘…In the name of Allah, whether it move or be at rest! For my Lord is, be sure, Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful!’You should shave the hair of your children when they are seven days old. Their head should be shaved and alms in the form of silver or gold equal in weight to their hair should be given as charity to Muslims. This is what God’s Prophet (MGB) did the same with Al-Hassan (MGB) and Al-Hussein (MGB) and his other offspring (MGB).Whenever you give something to a beggar ask him to pray for you. His prayer for you would be accepted, although since hey lies, his prayer for himself would never be accepted.You should kiss the hand with which you give something to a beggar, since the Honorable the Exalted God receives it before it reaches the beggar’s hand. The Honorable the Exalted God says, ‘Know they not that God doth accept repentance from His votaries and receives their gifts of charity…’You should give charity at night since that would extinguish God’s anger - may His Majesty be Exalted.You should consider whatever you say to be a part of your deeds.Speak as little as possible except for fair speech.Give in charity from what God has given you, since the position of one who gives charity is like that of one who fights in the way of God. Anyone who is sure that God will reward him would give charity and anyone who is not sure would withhold it.Anyone who is sure and then doubts should maintain his certitude because doubt would not invalidate certitude."

Do not sit with your legs crossed, since God doesn’t like this kind of sitting and considers those who sit that way to be His enemy.The Prophets dined after dusk.Do not forgo eating dinner since that would ruin the body.Fever is the forerunner for death. It is God’s prison on the Earth. Whenever God wants to imprison someone on the Earth, he would get a fever. Fever would shed one’s sins as leaves fall off a tree in the fall.All illnesses are internal except for wounds and fever that enter the body.Lessen the burning of fever with violet and cool water, since such a burning is from hell.Do not treat a Muslim until illness overtakes him.Saying supplications would change destiny. Use it as a tool for defense.There are ten good aspects of making ablutions after cleaning one’s self.Do not be lazy since a lazy person would not honor the Honorable the Exalted God’s rights.You should renew your ablutions when you let out bad-smelling air.Cleanse yourself since the Honorable the Exalted God doesn’t like a filthy person and anyone who sits with him would hate him.You should not play with your beard while you are saying your prayers. You should not play with anything else either while you are praying.Strive to do good deeds before you get busy with other work.A believer is one who suffers himself while others are comfortable with him.The best of your sayings are the remembrance of the Honorable the Exalted God.Do not commit sins since that would imprison your share of daily bread.Treat the patients in your family by giving charity, and guard your property by paying the alms-tax.Prayer is the tool for becoming near to God for all pious people.Hajj is the weak people’s holy war.The Holy War for a women is taking good care of her husband.Poverty is the greatest death.Having a small family is a type of wealth.Destiny is half of life.Sadness is half of oldness.No one who is moderate will ever become poor.Whoever seeks advice regarding his affairs would not get harmed.Kindness is good to noble or religious men.There is a fruit for everything. The fruit of good deeds lies in hurrying up in doing them.Anybody who is certain that God will give in return would give charity.The reward of one who doesn’t do anything in times of difficulty will be ruined.The best deed for man is waiting for the arrival of the Relief (i.e. the Riser (MGB)) from the Honorable the Exalted God.He who makes his mother and father sad has becomes disobedient of them.Expedite the arrival of your sustenance by giving charity.Fend off calamities by saying supplications before the calamities arrive.I swear by Him who splits up a seed and creates man, the speed with which poverty and calamities rush towards a believer is more than the downward speed of the flood from the top of the mountain and the running speed of camels.Ask God for protection against calamities since hard disasters can take away one’s religion."

A Muslim can attain good behavior by staying up at nights in worship and fasting.God would feed anyone - who drinks alcohol and knows that it is forbidden – with the stinky blood of the people of Hell, although he is forgiven.You should not make a bet regarding what would constitute sin. You should not swear to cut off your relations of kin either.One who invites others to do good deeds but doesn’t himself do good deeds is like a person who wants to shoot an arrow without a bow.A Muslim woman should put on perfume only for her husband.Anyone who is killed for keeping his property is considered to be a martyr.One who is ripped off (in a deal) is neither praiseworthy nor is he to be rewarded.An offspring’s testifying without his father’s permission and a wife’s testifying without her husband’s permission is not correct.Not speaking for a whole day from the morning until night is not good unless one is busy remembering the Honorable the Exalted God.There is no emigration from an Islamic environment. There will be no migration after victory. Do business so that you do not become needy of people, since the Honorable the Exalted God likes honest businessmen.Nothing is dearer to the Honorable the Exalted God than prayer. Worldly affairs should not prevent you from praying on time because the Honorable the Exalted God has complained about such people and said they are those ‘Who are neglectful of their prayers…’ This means that they are neglectful and do not pay enough attention to the prayer times.Know that your enemies are hypocrites when doing a good deed. The Honorable the Exalted God would not grant them success and would not accept anything but a sincere deed.Goodness doesn’t become old. Sins would not be forgotten. The Majestic God is with those who have piety and do good.A believer would not trick his brother, betray him, debase him or have bad suspicions of him. He would not tell him, ‘I hate you’.Seek a maiden for your brother to marry, but if you did not find one, seek a pious woman for him to marry.It is easier to destroy a mountain than it is to abolish the rule of an emperor whose life has not ended yet. Seek help from God and be patient, since God would grant the Earth as inheritance to those of His servants whom He wills. There is a good ending for the pious ones.Do not hurry before it is the right time, since then you may become sorry. Do not put things off too much, since then your hearts may get hardened.Have mercy upon the weak ones and seek the Honorable the Exalted God’s Mercy for yourself by having mercy upon them.I admonish you against gossiping about a Muslim, since a Muslim would not gossip about his brethren. The Honorable the Exalted God has admonished against this and said, ‘Would any of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother?…’A Muslim would not hold his hands together in prayer while he is standing in front of the Honorable the Exalted God. This would be like what the unbelievers, i.e. the Magians doYou should sit down like a servant of God when you want to eat. Eat on the ground and do not drink while standing up.Whenever you encounter a biting living creature while you are praying, you should bury it under the ground, spit on it, or wrap it up in some cloth until you finish saying your prayer.Turning the head away from the direction of the Qibla (prayer direction) would invalidate the prayer. Whoever does so should say his prayer again including the azan , the iqamah and the Takbirs.The properties of whoever recites the Chapter Al-Ikhlas eleven times before sunrise would be safe.Whoever recites the Chapter Al-Ikhlas (and the Chapter Al-Qadr ) before sunrise would be safe from committing any sins on that day no matter how hard Satan tries.You should take refuge in God from any deviation in religion and domination of men. Whoever opposes us would get destroyed. Tucking up the clothes helps to keep them clean as the Blessed the Sublime God said, “And thy garments keep free from stain!” Thus, God has ordered us to tuck up our clothes.One spoon of honey is the treatment for all ailments. The Blessed the Sublime God said, “…there issues from within their bodies a drink of varying colors, wherein is healing for men…” That includes reciting the Quran."

If you only knew the benefits of salt, you would prefer it to any antidotes. Seventy pains plus what no one but the Honorable the Exalted God knows of would be fended off of anyone who starts his meals by taking a little bit of salt.Pour some cool water on a head with fever in the summer in order to reduce the fever.You should fast three days each month. The reward would equal that of fasting your whole life. You should fast on two Thursdays in between which there is a Wednesday on which to fast. The Honorable the Exalted God created Hell on a Wednesday.Whenever you need something you should go out after it at the dawn of a Thursday since God’s Prophet (MGB) said, ‘O God! Please bless the dawn of Thursdays for my people.’ When you leave the house you should recite the end of the Chapter Al-Imran and the verse of the Throne (Ayat al-Kursi) and Inna Anzalnahu and the Opening Chapter (Al-Fatiha ) with the hope that his worldly needs and those of the Hereafter be fulfilled.You should wear thick clothing since those who wear thin clothing have a weak faith. You should not stand to pray in front of God - may His Majesty be Exalted - wearing thin clothing.Repent to the Honorable the Exalted God and enter His circle of Love since the Honorable the Exalted God loves those who repent, those who are clean and the believers who repent.Whenever a believer insults his believing brother their relationship will be hurt. If one calls another one an unbeliever, then one of them would become an unbeliever. Once one accuses another Muslim, the faith in Islam melts in his heart as salt would dissolve in water.The doors of repentance are open to anybody who wants to repent. Repent to God sincerely. Maybe your Lord would cover up your sins.You should honor your covenants. Blessings and happiness would not be destroyed except by the sins which you commit.God would not oppress his servants. The people would not have faced any calamities if they supplicated. Blessings will depart when calamities befall. Cry at the Threshold of the Honorable the Exalted God with good intentions and then God will amend things and give back the good things.Whenever things become hard to do, a Muslim should ask the Honorable the Exalted God for help since the key to everything is in His hands.There are three characteristics in every man. They are evil omen; pride or haughtiness; and high aspirations. Whenever you feel an evil omen, you should ignore it and mention the Honorable the Exalted God. Whenever you fear that you are becoming haughty, you should eat along with your servants, and milk the calf . When you feel that high aspirations are driving you crazy, you should ask the Honorable the Exalted God not to leave you alone with your disobedient self to be led to sins.Associate with people based on what are generally accepted norms, not on what they do not believe in. Do not force anything upon us or yourselves. Indeed our affairs are difficult and no one but the nearby-stationed angels and persons whose wholehearted faith God has tested can withstand it.When Satan tempts you, you should take refuge in God and say, ‘I believe in Allah and in His Messenger, with pure sincerity in the religion.’Whenever the Honorable the Exalted God grants a believer some new clothes, he should perform the ritual ablutions (wuzu) and say two units of prayers in which he recites the Mother of the Book (i.e. the first Chapter of the Holy Quran), the verse of the Throne (Ayat al-Kursi) , Qul Hoallahu Ahad (Al-Ikhlas ), and Inna Anzalnaho fi laylatul Qadr (Al-Qadr) . Then he should praise God who has covered up his private parts and adorned him amongst the people and say the following many times, ‘There is no power nor any strength save in God the Sublime the Great.’He should not commit any sins wearing those clothes. There are as many angels as there are yarns in those clothes who ask God for his forgiveness and God’s Mercy."

My household and my grandsons will be with me. Whoever wants us should follow our sayings and deeds. There are good folks in every family for whom we shall intercede. We shall also intercede on behalf of those who love us.Therefore you should compete with each other for seeing us at the Heavenly Pool. We shall block off our enemies from access to it and shall satiate our lovers with it.Anyone who takes a sip of the Heavenly Pool’s water will never become thirsty. There are two Heavenly Creeks flowing into our Pool. One of them is called Tasnim and the other one is called Mo’een. There is saffron dirt on the side of the Pool with pearls and rubies as pebbles. This Pool is called Al-Kauthar.The good flow of affairs is up to the Honorable the Exalted God. It is not based upon the will of the people. Were it based upon the will of the people, they never would have chosen others (to follow) instead of us. However, God wants to make certain people especial as He wills. You should thank God since He has made you especial with a great blessing being that you are born legitimately.On the Resurrection Day every eye will be crying and sleepless except for the eyes of those whom God has made especial through His Nobility and have cried over the calamities imposed upon Al-Hussein (MGB) and the Holy Household of Muhammad (MGB).Our followers are like honey bees. If people knew (about the sweetness of) what they believed in, they would eat them up.You should not rush to eat until you get finished. You should also not rush when you are in the toilet.When you wake up from sleep, you should say ‘There is no god save Allah, the All-clement, the All-Noble, the Ever-living, the Self-Subsisting. He has power over all things. All glory be to the Lord of the Prophets and the God of the Messengers. All glory be to the Lord of the seven heavens, the seven layers of the earth, and whatever is between them, and the Lord of the Great Throne. All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds.’Once you sit down you should say the following before you stand up, ‘Sufficient to me is Allah. Sufficient to me is the Lord against the servants (of Him). Sufficient to me is He Who has been always sufficient to me. Sufficient to me is Allah, and He is the best of all guardians.When you wake up at night you should look at the stars in the sky and recite the last four verses of the Chapter Al-i-Imran as follows, ‘Men who celebrate the praises of Allah, standing, sitting, and lying down on their sides, and contemplate the (wonders of) creation in the heavens and the Earth, (with the thought): ""Our Lord! not for naught Hast Thou created (all) this! Glory to Thee! Give us salvation from the penalty of the Fire. Our Lord! any whom Thou dost admit to the Fire, Truly Thou coverest with shame, and never will wrong-doers Find any helpers! Our Lord! we have heard the call of one calling (Us) to Faith, ’Believe ye in the Lord,’ and we have believed. Our Lord! Forgive us our sins, blot out from us our iniquities, and take to Thyself our souls in the company of the righteous. Our Lord! Grant us what Thou didst promise unto us through Thine apostles, and save us from shame on the Day of Judgment: For Thou never breakest Thy promise.’The Zamzam well can take away pains. Drink its water. The well is located at the Rukn where the Hajar ul-Aswad is located since there are four Heavenly creeks flowing under the Hajar ul-Aswad called Al-Forat, Al-Niel , Al-Seihan , and Al-Jeihan which are in two streams.A Muslim should not go to fight along with one in whose orders there can be no assurance of and who may not abide by the Decrees of the Honorable the Exalted God regarding booties. Should one die in these conditions, he would be considered to be an aid to our enemies for having usurped our rights and having shed our blood. Such a death is similar to death in the Age of Ignorance.The remembrance of us - the members of the Holy Household - is the treatment for pains, illnesses and the temptations of hearts. Our friendship brings the satisfaction of the Honorable the Exalted Lord.Anyone who follows our orders is going to be with us in the Holy Presence. Anyone who awaits our Rule is like a person whose blood is shed in the way of God.God will throw into the Fire anyone who participates in a war against us or who hears our cry for justice but doesn’t help us."

We save whoever is oppressed, has no way to flee and calls out for justice. We are the gates of peace. Whoever enters the, shall be saved and whoever disobeys us will be destroyed.God starts with us. God destroys by us what He wishes to destroy. God establishes everything through us. God will fend off hard times from you due to us. God will descend rain due to us. You should not be deceived and turn away from God due to your pride.There has been no drops of Mercy from the Heavens since the Honorable the Exalted God closed the gates of Heaven. Once our Riser (MGB) uprises, there will come down drops of rain from the heavens; plants will grow out of the ground; hatred will be removed from the hearts of the people; beasts and other animals will be in peace with each other such that a woman can walk from Iraq to Syria stepping on greenery all the way with her adornments on and no beasts would frighten her.You would be amazed if you knew the rank you attain when you stand up against your enemies.Once you lose me, you will see many things from the hands of the unbelievers, the enemies, the selfish people who will belittle God’s right and threaten your life. Then you will wish death. Once this happens you should unite together and do not divide up into several groups. You should adhere to God’s Strong Rope.I advise you to be patient, to pray and be pious. You should know that the Blessed the Sublime God despises hypocritical people. Therefore, do not deviate from what is right.Do not give up friendship with the righteous ones. Whoever prefers others to us will be destroyed. He will also be at a loss in this world. He will leave it (i.e. die) with regret.When you enter your house, greet your family by saying ‘Peace be upon you.’ If no one is at home, say, ‘peace be upon us from our Lord.’You should recite the Chapter Al-Ikhlas while entering your house, since that would eliminate poverty.Teach your children how to pray and question them about it when they become eight years old.Do not get near dogs. Anybody who touches a wet dog should make ablutions. Anyone who touches a dry dog should sprinkle water on his clothes.If you hear a tradition from us which you do not understand, compare it with other works by us, and ponder over it until the truth becomes known to you.Do not be one who rushes to divulge the secrets.The people who have boasted about us should return to the limits of our instructions, and the people who have neglected us should join us.Whoever adheres to us will reach the goal. However, whoever follows ways other than our way will be drowned.There are flocks of God’s Mercy for our friends, and there are flocks of God’s Wrath for our enemies.Moderation is our way, and there is progress in following our orders.Doubting about which units you are saying will invalidate the following prayers: the Al-Vatr prayers , the Friday prayers, in the first two units of all prayers, the dawn prayer and the evening prayer.When you are not clean you should not recite the Quran until you make ablutions.When you are saying your prayers you should honor and perform any necessary prostrations and bowings for the Chapters which you recite.You should not pray in such clothing that the people of Lot wore."

However, it is allowed to stand on such a carpet on which there is an image or throw a cloth on it so that it becomes covered. You should not tie a coin upon which there is an image onto your clothes in which you pray. However, you can put the coin into a bag or in other clothing. If you are worried about it being stolen, you may tie it onto your waist.You should not say your prayers upon wheat, barley, other nutrients or bread.You should not make ablutions before mentioning God’s name.Before touching the water to make ablutions one must say ‘In the name of God.

Whenever you are standing in front of the Mighty the Exalted God you should extend out your chest, stand up straight and do not bend.Whenever you finish saying your prayers, you should raise your hands up towards the heavens and seek what you want.Abdullah ibn Saba asked, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! Is it not true that God exists everywhere?’ The Commander of the Faithful (MGB) replied, ‘Yes.’ Then Abdullah ibn Saba asked, ‘Why is it then that one should raise his hands up towards the heavens when he prays?’ He (MGB) replied, ‘Have you not read the following verse, ‘And in heaven is your Sustenance, as (also) that which ye are promised.’ Would you then seek your sustenance elsewhere? The heavens is the place where our sustenance and whatever the Honorable the Exalted God has promised lies.You should not finish your prayer without asking God for heaven, seeking refuge to God from hell and asking God to marry you to a green-eyed Houri .Whenever you stand to say your prayers, you should say it as if it is going to be the last prayer you are ever going to say in your life.Smiling would not void one’s prayers but laughing out loud would.Whenever you fall asleep, you should renew your ablutions.Whenever you start to doze off or fall asleep in the middle of saying your prayers, you should stop praying since in such a prayer you might curse yourself instead of saying supplications.Whoever who loves us by heart and helps us with his tongue and fights our enemies would be along with us and in the same rank as we are in Paradise.Whoever loves us by heart and helps us with tongue, but doesn’t assist us in fighting our enemies would be two ranks lower.Whoever loves us by heart, but doesn’t help us either with his tongue or hand would be in Paradise.Whoever is our enemy by heart and doesn’t harm us with tongue and hand would go to Hell along with our enemies.Whoever is our enemy by heart and doesn’t harm us with his tongue would go to Hell.Whoever is our enemy by heart and harms us with his tongue and hand would go to Hell."

One was lost at sea and the other one was lost in the desert.You should not eat any animals that you do not recognize to be legitimate.Whenever a believer gets ill and doesn’t complain to anyone but God for three days, God will bestow upon him health.When one is only interested in filling his stomach and fulfilling his sexual desires, he gets farther away from God.One should not go on a trip that might harm his religion or prayer.There are four who hear everyone: The Prophet (MGB), Paradise, the Fire, and the green-eyed Houries. When one finishes saying his prayer, he should send blessings upon Muhammad (MGB) and his Holy Household, ask God for Paradise, ask God for protection from the Fire, ask God to be paired up with green-eyed Houries . In fact, the Prophet (MGB) hears the prayers of whoever sends blessings upon the Prophet Muhammad (MGB) and takes them up to God. When anyone asks God for Paradise, Paradise would say, ‘O Lord! Please grant to your servant what he has asked Thee for.’ When anyone seeks protection from the Fire, the Fire would say, ‘O Lord! Protect your servant from what he seeks protection.’ And when anyone asks for green-eyed Houries, they will say, ‘O Lord! Please grant your servant what he asks for.’Music is the cry of Satan for Paradise.Whenever any of you decides to go to sleep, you should put your right hand under your right cheek and say the following: “In the Name of Allah. I put my side for the sake of Allah, following the faith of Abraham, the religion of Muhammad, and the loyalty to him whom Allah has imposed loyalty to him on me. Only that which Allah wills shall come to pass, and whatever He does not will shall never come to pass.”Anybody who says this supplication before going to sleep would be safe from a plundering thief, going under the load of a collapsed building and the angels would pray for his forgiveness.The Honorable the Exalted God would appoint 50,000 angels to protect whomever recites the Opening Chapter of the Holy Quran (Al-Fatiha ) when he goes to bed."

Surely, my Lord knows the right path. He is All-Powerful over everything. All might and power belongs to God.”Anybody who says this supplication before going to sleep would be safe from a plundering thief, going under the load of a collapsed building and the angels would pray for his forgiveness.God’s Prophet (MGB) protected al-Hassan (MGB) and al-Hussein (MGB) this way and he (MGB) has ordered us to use it.We are the treasures of God’s religion. We are the keys to knowledge. Whenever one of us - Divine Leaders - passes away, another one will come after him. Whoever follows us would not go astray. Whoever denies us would not be guided. Whoever prefers our enemies over us would not be saved. Whoever abandons us will find no one to help him. Do not turn back from us due to greed for this world in which the goods will not last. Whoever prefers this world over the Hereafter and prefers it to us would be very sorry in the Hereafter. These are the words of the Honorable the Exalted God, “Lest the soul should (then) say, ‘Ah! Woe is me!- In that I neglected (my duty) towards God, and was but among those who mocked!’”Keep your children clean and wash off any food after meals from them since Satan would smell it, frighten the child while he sleeps, and the two angels who record your deeds will be annoyed by it.The first look at a woman is fine, but you should not repeat it and you should fear temptations.An alcoholic would meet God as an idol worshipper would. Hujr ibn Uday asked, ‘O Commander of the Faithful! Who is an alcoholic?’ The Imam (MGB) replied, ‘It is a person who drinks wine whenever he finds it.’The prayers of anyone who drinks an intoxicative drink would not be accepted for forty days and nights.The Sublime God will imprison in oozy grounds in Hell whoever says something to dishonor a Muslim until he proves what he has said.Two naked men should not sleep in one bed. (Two naked women should also not sleep in one bed.) Should they do so, they must be chastised.Eat pumpkin since it strengthens mental powers. God’s Prophet (MGB) was amazed at pumpkin.Eat lemons before and after each meal as the members of the Holy Household of Muhammad (MGB) did.Eating pears would brighten the heart and sooth inner pains.When one stands up to say his prayer Satan faces him and watches him with regret since Satan sees that the man is showered with God’s Mercy.The worst deed related to religion is making innovations and the best ones are those which please the Honorable the Exalted God.Anyone who worships this world and prefers it to the Hereafter shall have a terrible ending.Use clean water.Whoever is satisfied with what God has granted him would be in comfort.Whoever spends his vigor and life in what would take him far away from the Honorable the Exalted God is a loser.If one who prays only knew how God’s Glory surrounds him during prayer, he would never raise his head up after prostrating in worship.Do not procrastinate your task. Do as much of it as you can.You will receive whatever is your share of daily bread no matter how weak you may be. You would suffer from any calamities which you are supposed to suffer from. There is no way for you to fend off what is destined for you.Enjoin to do good and admonish against doing evil. Persevere at times of difficulty.A believer’s lantern is recognizing our rightfulness.The worst form of blindness is not being able to see our virtues and our enemies although we are not guilty of anything but to have invited them to the truth, while others invited them to sedition and sticking to this world. They chose sedition and sticking to this world over us. They hate us and is our enemy.We hold the flag of righteousness in our hands. It will protect anyone who comes under its shadow. Whoever rushes to follow it would prosper. Whoever opposes it would perish. Whoever abandons it would be debased. Whoever adheres to it would be rescued.I am the Queen Bee (Leader) of the believers, while wealth is the queen bee of cruel people.I swear by God that nobody but believers love me, and nobody but hypocrites despise me.Whenever you met your brethren you should shake hands, smile and be happy until you part. Then all your sins will be eliminated when you leave each other.When anyone sneezes you should tell him, ‘May God bless you.’ He should say, ‘May God forgive and bless you’ in return. The Blessed the Sublime God says, ‘When a (courteous) greeting is offered you, meet it with a greeting still more courteous, or (at least) of equal courtesy…’Shake hands with your enemies and treat them with kindness as the Honorable the Exalted God has ordered His servants to do so, ‘…Then will he between whom and thee was hatred become as it were thy friend and intimate! And no one will be granted such goodness except those who exercise patience and self-restraint,- none but persons of the greatest good fortune.’The hardest way to punish your enemy is to obey God regarding him and treat him according to God’s orders. It would suffice for you to see that your enemies disobey the Honorable and the Exalted God.This world rotates. Seek what you want to gain from it slowly whenever your turn comes."

He should be awaiting worldly relief or a felicitous death. He should be frightened by calamities that are punishment for his sins. He should be hopeful of the Honorable the Exalted God’s Mercy.A believer is not without fright and hope. He is frightened due to his past, but he doesn’t neglect to seek what God has promised. He is not safe from what the Honorable the Exalted God has frightened us from.You are the cultivators of Earth. The Honorable and the Exalted God has placed you there to see what you do there. Then keep an eye on what God sees you do there.I advise you to stay on this wide road. Lest others will take over your place.Whoever has perfected intellect would do good deeds and guard his religion.‘Be ye foremost (in seeking) Forgiveness from your Lord, and a Garden (of Bliss), the width whereof is as the width of heaven and Earth, prepared for those who believe in Allah…’ You would never reach that ‘Garden of Bliss’ unless you are pious.Those who become filthy with sinful deeds would abandon the Honorable the Exalted God’s remembrance.God would appoint a satan to be constantly with whomever doesn’t obey those whom the Honorable the Exalted God has ordered us to obey.Your opponents are more steadfast in their wickedness. They are better in spending money on their desires. Indeed you pay attention to this world on which you rely. You have become used to tolerating cruelty. You are stingy regarding this world’s goods and have neglected what would be better for your honor, comfort and power to overcome those who oppress you. You are neither ashamed of God regarding what He has ordered you to do, nor would you think about what would be best for you.You are not awakened, although you are oppressed every day. Your feebleness doesn’t end.Don’t you see that each day your towns and religion suffer more and more, while you are ignorant and entertained with this world. The Honorable the Exalted God tells you, ‘And incline not to those who do wrong, or the Fire will seize you; and ye have no protectors other than God, nor shall ye be helped.’You should name your children. In case you do not know their gender (before birth), you can give them a name that is suitable for either boys or girls. Even if it gets aborted, it would question the father on the Resurrection Day for not having named it. God’s Prophet (MGB) had named Fatimah’s (MGB) child Mohsen before he was born.You should not drink water while standing up, since that would cause a pain for which there is no cure unless the Honorable the Exalted God restores health.Whenever you mount a quadruped remember the Honorable the Exalted God says, ‘…In order that ye may sit firm and square on their backs, and when so seated, ye may celebrate the (kind) favor of your Lord, and say, ""Glory to Him Who has subjected these to our (use), for we could never have accomplished this (by ourselves). And to our Lord, surely, must we turn back!”’Whenever you go on a trip you should say: “O Allah, You are the companion in journeys, the helper in transport, and the guard of the wife, property, and sons. ”When you settle down in a house you should say, “O Allah, grant me a blessed landing. You are the One who provides the safest landing.”When you go shopping you should say, “I declare there is no god but Allah uniquely without any associate, and declare that Mohammed is His servant and messenger. O Allah, I seek Your safety from losing deals and perjury, and seek Your safety from stagnancy.”Anyone who awaits for the time of the next prayer is considered to be amongst the visitors of the Honorable the Exalted God. He has a right incumbent upon the Sublime God to honor His visitors and grant them whatever they ask for.Whoever goes on the Hajj pilgrimage or the Umra Hajj is God’s guest. It is hoped that God would forgive him.The Sublime God will imprison in oozy grounds in Hell whoever gives a child an alcoholic drink, until he apologizes for what he has done.Giving charity is a strong shield from the Fire for a believer, and for a nonbeliever is a device to save his money. It is a protection of property for an atheist. Soon it will be returned to him. It would fend off calamities. However, there will be no heavenly reward for it for an atheist.The residents of Hell shall fall down into the Fire with their tongues first.The residents of Light will be bestowed light through their tongues. Therefore watch your tongues and keep them busy remembering the Honorable the Exalted God.The most wicked deed is what would lead one to going astray. The best deeds are acts of charity.Beware not to make any sculptures, since you would be questioned about them on the Resurrection Day."

First glorify the Honorable the Exalted God, then ask Him to fulfill your needs.)O Suppliant! Do not ask for an illegitimate or an impossible thing.Whenever you want to congratulate someone for having been granted a boy, you should say, ‘May God bless you with this munificence, extend his life to youth and may God establish his good deeds as your share of daily bread.Whenever one of your brethren returns from the Hajj pilgrimage, kiss him between his two eyes and kiss his lips with which he has kissed the Black Stone which God’s Prophet (MGB) kissed. Kiss his eyes because he has seen the Honorable the Exalted God’s house with it. Kiss his forehead and face and to congratulate him say ‘May God accept your Hajj. May God take this into consideration and reimburse you with whatever you have spent. May this not be the last time you go on the Hajj pilgrimage.’Stay away from the lowly people, since they are not afraid of the Honorable the Exalted God. The murderers of the Prophets are amongst them. Our enemies are amongst them.The Blessed the Sublime God honored the Earth and chose us. He chose followers for us so that they may help us; be pleased when we get pleased and be sad when we are sad; and give away their money and life in our way. They are from us and will join us.When any of our followers commits a sin, he will not die until he encounters a calamity that would be an expiation for his sins. This calamity would either be regarding his property, children or health so that they may be purified when they meet the Honorable the Exalted God. Should any sins be left when they die, then they will have a very harsh death.Our followers will die as sincere martyred friends (of ours), since they have acknowledged our leadership, have been friends (with some) for our sake, have been enemies (with some) for our sake. This is what the Honorable the Exalted God wishes. They have believed in God and His Prophet (MGB). The Honorable the Exalted God says, ‘And those who believe in God and His apostles - they are the Sincere (lovers of Truth), and the witnesses (who testify), in the eyes of their Lord, They shall have their Reward and their Light.’The Children of Israel divided up into seventy-two sects. There will come a time when these people will divide up into seventy-three sects. Only one of these sects will go to Paradise.God would make anyone who divulges our secret taste the hardness of the iron (i.e. God would punish him).Circumcise your children on the seventh day after their birth. Do not worry about the heat or the cold.Circumcision cleans the body.The Earth would cry to God when an uncircumcised person urinates.There are four kinds of being drunk: drunkenness due to alcohol; drunkenness due to wealth; drunkenness due to sleeping; and drunkenness due to kingdom.When one of you sleeps, he should place his hand under the right cheek because he doesn’t know whether he wakes up or not.When you intend to sleep place your right hand under your right cheek, since you never know whether you are going to wake up or not.I would like believers to apply depilatory powder or cream once every fifteen days."

Whey is a remedy for every illness except for death. Eat pomegranates with the pulp since it would clean the stomach. Each pomegranate seed that enters the stomach will revive the heart, cleanse the soul and force Satan’s temptations out of it for forty nights. Vinegar is very useful since it decreases the bile. Use white succory every dawn as it has heavenly drops in it. Drink rain water since it cleans the body and takes away illnesses. God the Blessed the Sublime said, ‘…and he caused rain to descend on you from heaven, to clean you therewith, to remove from you the stain of Satan, to strengthen your hearts, and to plant your feet firmly therewith.’ Nigella seeds are a cure for everything except for being poisoned. Beef can cause illnesses. Cow’s milk is like a drug. Cow’s oil is a cure. There is no better food or cure for a pregnant woman than fresh dates. The Honorable the Exalted God told Mary (MGB), ‘And shake towards thyself the trunk of the palm-tree, It will let fall fresh ripe dates upon thee. So eat and drink and cool (thine) eye.’Feed the baby dates the first time you feed him as God’s Prophet (MGB) did with Al-Hassan (MGB) and Al-Hussein (MGB). When you want to sleep with your wife, you should not rush her into bed. You should give her some time to prepare herself for bed. Women need certain preparations before they can sleep with their husbands. When you see an unfamiliar woman and are attracted to her, you should sleep with your own wife. She also has the same beauties which you see in that unfamiliar woman. Do not let Satan enter your hearts. Do not look at an unfamiliar woman. If one wants to get married, he should say two units of prayer, praise God very much, send blessings upon the Prophet (MGB) and his Household. Then he should ask God to grant him a wife out of His Nobility and Kindness. When you sleep with your wife you should speak as little as possible in that state. Speaking while sleeping with one’s spouse might cause the child to be dumb. You should not look into your wife’s vagina, since then you might see something that you dislike. It may also result in blindness. When you wants to make love with your wife, you should say, ‘O my God! I have legitimized her love for me according to your decrees. I have accepted her as You entrusted her to me. If You destine a child for me from her, please let it be a perfectly healthy child and do not let any involvement or partnership of Satan in it.” Hypodermic injections can heal four ailments. God’s Prophet (MGB) said, “Indeed hypodermic injection is one of the best forms of treatment.” Hypodermic injections can fatten the stomach, take away inner pains and strengthen the body. Use viola. Blood-letting is recommended for you. It is not recommended to have sexual intercourse with your wife on the first night of the (lunar) month or the middle of the (lunar) month, since Satan seeks a child at these times and the other devils are his associates and come after the child. Do not have blood-letting performed or applied on Wednesdays since Wednesday is an eternally sinister day on which Hell was created. There is an hour on Fridays during which anyone who performs blood-letting would die."

They accepted Islam due to her efforts. She did not go to the Prophet (MGB) for a few days. The Prophet (MGB) asked Gabriel about her condition. Gabriel replied, ‘She has gone to visit one of her believing sisters.’ The Prophet (MGB), ‘Blessed be those who make friends in the way of the Blessed the Sublime God. God The Blessed The Exalted has created a pillar from red ruby in Heaven upon which there are seventy-thousand palaces each with seventy-thousand rooms. God has created them for those who make friendship for the sake of God and visit each other.’ When Afra’e went to see the Prophet (MGB), he (MGB) asked her, ‘O Afra’e! What did you see?’ She replied, ‘I saw many strange things.’ The Prophet (MGB) asked, ‘Whatwas the strangest thing?’ She replied, ‘The strangest of all was that I saw that Satan was sitting on a white stone in a green sea and had raised his hands to the sky and said, ‘O my God! When you fulfill your promise and throw me into the Fire of Hell, I beseech you in the rightfulness of Muhammad (MGB), Ali (MGB), Fatimah (MGB), Al-Hassan (MGB) and Al-Hussein (MGB) to release me from the Fire of Hell and unite me with them on the Resurrection Day.’ Afra’e added, ‘I told Satan, ‘O Satan! What are these names with which you beseech God?’ Satan replied, ‘I saw them on the foreleg of God’s Throne seventy-thousand years before God created Adam and I knew that they are the dearest of the creations to God. That is why I beseech God by their rightfulness.’ The Prophet (MGB) said, ‘Whenever the people on the Earth beseech God using these names, God would fulfill their supplications.’”"
