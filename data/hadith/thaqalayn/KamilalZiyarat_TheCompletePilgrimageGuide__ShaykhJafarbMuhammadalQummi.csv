Kāmil al-Ziyārāt,The Complete Pilgrimage Guide,,Shaykh Jaʿfar b. Muḥammad al-Qummī,Sayyid Mohsen Al-Husayni Al-Milani,"Kāmil al-Ziyārāt is a significant work by the esteemed scholar Ibn Qūlawayh al-Qummī. This book offers an invaluable collection of narrations centred around Ziyāra, the practice of visiting the sacred sites of the Shīʿa. The structure of Kāmil al-Ziyārāt is reader-friendly, beginning with an exploration of Ziyārāt and its various purposes and benefits. It then delves into the Ziyārāt of specific holy personalities and related themes. The book details the rewards associated with visitations, the proper rituals to perform, the designated recitations, and much more, as prescribed by the Ahl al-Bayt (as). The majority of this expansive 680-page work concentrates on the Ziyāra of Imam Husayn (as). Kāmil al-Ziyārāt is not merely a practical guide to take on a Ziyārāt trip. Instead, it transcends being a logistical guidebook to offer spiritual enrichment, insightful historical context, and a profound understanding of the purpose and merits of these sacred journeys. Whether one is planning a Ziyārā, yearning for one, or simply interested in comprehending its essence, this book offers meaningful and engaging content. Renowned in the world of Shia for being a trusted reference for Ḥadīths and supplications, Kāmil al-Ziyārāt is an essential reading for those eager to gain an in-depth understanding of Ziyāra and the rich traditions that envelop it. Its relevance extends beyond personal spiritual growth, making it a valuable resource for religious research.",1 | Introduction,Chapter 1 | Introduction,Ḥadīth #1,بِسْمِ اللّهِ الرَّحْمنِ الرَّحِيمِالحمد لله أهل الحمد و وليه و الدالّ عليه و المجازي به و المثيب عنه حمدا يزيد و لا يبيد و لا ينفد جلّ جلاله و عظم سلطانه و تعالى مكانه و تقدّست أسماؤه و اتصلت آلاؤه و تواضع كل شيء لهيبته و خضع كل شيء لملكه و ربوبيّته و لا يدرك الواصفون صفته و لا تبلغ الأوهام كنه معرفته فهو كما وصف نفسه إلها واحدا أحدا صمدا لَمْ يَلِدْ وَ لَمْ يُولَدْ. وَ لَمْ- يَكُنْ لَهُ كُفُواً أَحَدٌ و أشهد أن لا إله إلا الله وحده لا شريك له و أشهد أن محمدا عبده و رسوله أعطاه الوسيلة و شرفه بالفضيلة و أكرمه بالرسالة و أيّده بالدلالة و أبان به الإسلام و فضله على جميع خلقه من أهل سمائه و أرضه و بره و بحره فضلا لا يسمو إليه حد و لا يبلغه واصف و فضل به أهل بيته على جميع الأنام و جعلهم الحجج البالغة و أيدهم بالإمامة و افترض طاعتهم على جميع من به دان و لله وحّد و برسوله (ص) أقرّ و جعل فضلهم فضلا لا يصفه واصف و لا يدركه ناعت و لا يبلغ منتهاه ذو لبّ- و لا يطمع فيه طامع فجعلهم نجوم الأرض يهتدى بهم من الضلالة و يزيل بهم حيرة العمى و جعلهم أوتاد الأرض أن تميد بأهلها و أبان فضلهم على لسان نبيه (ص) و فرض على العباد مودّتهم في كتابه الناطق- على لسان نبيه الصادق حيث يقول جلّ من قائل- قُلْ لا أَسْئَلُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ أَجْراً إِلَّا الْمَوَدَّةَ فِي الْقُرْبى فأمر النبي (ص) بحبهم و حثّ على التقرّب إليهم في برّهم و زيارتهم في حياتهم و بعد مماتهم و جعل لذلك ثوابا و فضلا لا تحيط به الأوهام و ما لا يحصيه الأنام و لا يبلغ وصف واصف منه التمام ففعلت أمته (ص) ضد ما أمر به الله و نبيه (ص) فقتلوا من أمروا بمحبته و شردوا من أمروا بطاعته و جفوا من أمروا بزيارته و أخافوا من قبل ذلك بأحسن قبول و قام به أحسن قيام على مقدار طاقة الإمكان و قدرة الزمان و عادوهم على ذلك ثم مع ذلك يرجون بأنهم يوفقون للرشاد و أنهم مقيمون على السداد مؤدّون لما افترض عليهم بالليل و النهار راجون شفاعة نبيهم يوم القرار كلا بل نبيهم المخاصم لهم يوم المعاد و الطالب لهم بما فعلوا عند الثواب في يوم القيامة بين يدي رب الأرباب تبارك و تعالى عن ظلم العباد و إِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَبِالْمِرْصادِ و أنا مبين لك أطال الله بقاءك ما أثاب الله به الزائر لنبيه و أهل بيته (صلوات الله عليهم أجمعين )بالآثار الواردة عنهم (ص) على رغم من أنكر فضلهم ذلك و جحده و أباه و عادى عليه و بالله أستعين على ذلك و عليه أتوكل و هو حسبي في الأمور كلها وَ نِعْمَ الْوَكِيلُ. و إنما دعاني إلى تصنيف كتابي هذا مسألتك و تردادك القول علي مرة بعد أخرى تسألني ذلك و لعلمي بما فيه لي من المثوبة- و التقرب إلى الله تبارك و تعالى و إلى رسوله و إلى علي و فاطمة و الأئمة (صلوات الله عليهم)أجمعين و إلى جميع المؤمنين ببثه فيهم و نشره في إخواني المؤمنين على جملته فأشغلت الفكر فيه و صرفت الهم إليه و سألت الله تبارك و تعالى العون عليه حتى أخرجته و جمعته عن الأئمة (صلوات الله عليهم أجمعين )من أحاديثهم و لم أخرج فيه حديثا روي عن غيرهم إذا كان فيما روينا عنهم من حديثهم ص- كفاية عن حديث غيرهم و قد علمنا أنا لا نحيط بجميع ما روي عنهم في هذا المعنى و لا في غيره لكن ما وقع لنا من جهة الثقات من أصحابنا (رحمهم الله برحمته) و لا أخرجت فيه حديثا روي عن الشذاذ من الرجال يؤثر ذلك عنهم عن المذكورين غير المعروفين بالرواية المشهورين بالحديث و العلم و سميته كتاب كامل الزيارات و فضلها و ثواب ذلك و فصلته أبوابا كل باب منه يدل على معنى لم أخرج فيه حديثا يدل على غير معناه فيختلف على الناظر فيه و القارئ له و لا يعلم ما يطلب و إني و كيف كما فعل غيرنا من المصنفين إذ جعلوا الباب بغير ما ضمنوه فأخرجوا في الباب أحاديث لا تدل على معنى الباب حتى ربما لم يكن في الباب حديث يدل على معنى بين من الأحاديث التي لا تليق بترجمة الباب و لا على شيء منه و الذي أردت بذلك التسهيل على من أراد حديثا منه قصد الباب الذي يريد الحديث فيه فيجده و لئلا يمل الناظر فيه و القارئ له و المستمع لقراءته و ليعلم ما خصّ اللّه به وليَّه من زائري قبر الحسين (ع) و السادة (ص) و لتكثر الرغبة فيهم و في زيارتهم (ص) طلبا لما أعدّ الله جلَّ و عزَّ لهم من الثواب الجزيل و الفوز العظيم و الله أسأل بما هو أهله و بأحب أسمائه إليه أن يصلي على محمد و آله مكافاتي عليه ما أمَّلته فأردته و أن لا يحرمني من ذلك برحمته و جوده و كرمه و صلى الله على محمد و آله الصفوة الأخيار الأبرار عليهم السلام و رحمة الله و بركاته.,"1. In the Name of Allāh, Most Gracious, Most Merciful Praise is due to Allāh who is worthy of praise and has authority over it. He guides the people toward it (praising Him) and rewards them and compensates them for it – an increasing praise which does not vanish nor end. His might is exalted and His sovereignty is great. He is exalted, His names are sacred, and His blessings are continuous. Everything is humiliated in His Awe and is humble before His Ruling and Divinity. One cannot describe His characteristics and the imagination cannot fathom knowing Him. He is as He has described Himself: the God, the One, the Only, the Eternal, He is not begotten nor does he beget, and there is none like Him. And I testify that there is no god but Allāh. He is alone and He has no partners. And I testify that Muḥammad ﷺ is His Slave and His Messenger. He (Allāh) has given him (the Prophet ﷺ) the platform (on the Day of Judgment), honoured him with (innumerable) merits, dignified him with prophethood, supported him with miracles, and manifested Islām through him. He has elevated him above all of His creation from among the inhabitants of His heavens, His earths, His lands, and His oceans. He has elevated him to a position which no one can ascend to and no one can describe. He has elevated the Prophets’ family above all of creation through him and He has appointed them as His Manifesting Decisive Proofs. He supported them with Imamate and made obeying them mandatory on everyone who follows His religion, believes in His Oneness, and testifies to (the prophethood of) His Messenger ﷺ. He has made their merits such that no one can describe them and no one can truly praise them. The most intelligent ones cannot truly understand their merits and no one can wrongfully desire their (unique) merits. He has appointed them as the stars for the earth through whom people are guided (and prevented) from going astray and through whom confusion and (spiritual) blindness are kept away. And He has appointed them as the pillars of the earth who prevent it from destroying its inhabitants. He has explained their merits on the tongue of His Prophet ﷺ and made loving them obligatory on His slaves in His Speaking Book and through the tongue of His Truthful Prophet ﷺ by saying – and He is the most honourable one to say anything – “Say (O Muḥammad) I do not ask you anything for the toils of prophethood, except love for my nearest kin” (42:23). The Prophet ﷺ ordered (the people) to love them and stressed seeking nearness to them, being kind to them, and going to their Ziyārah during their lives and after their death. He mentioned such (incredible) merits and rewards for going to their Ziyārah that (these merits and rewards) are beyond that which can be fathomed by the human imagination, counted by all of the created beings, or truly described. However, his nation did the opposite of that which Allāh and His Messenger ﷺ had ordered. Instead (his nation) killed those whom they were ordered to love, expelled those whom they were ordered to obey, and abandoned those to whose Ziyārah they were ordered to go. They frightened those who accepted the orders of Allāh willingly and who fulfilled them based on their ability and the circumstances of the time. They antagonized them (for going to Ziyārah). Despite this, they expect to be guided to the right path, they believe that they are the followers of the correct path and that they fulfill that which has been made obligatory on them day and night. And they expect the intercession of their Prophet ﷺ on the Appointed Day (of Judgment). Nay!!! Their Prophet ﷺ will be their enemy on the Promised Day! He will seek revenge against them at the time of reward (and punishment) on the Day of Judgment in front of the Lord of the lords. Verily He is Blessed and Exalted, far above oppressing the slaves. “Lo! Your Lord is ever watchful” (89:14). I will explain to you – may Allah extend your life – the rewards which Allāh gives to those who go to the Ziyārah of His Prophet and his family through that which has been narrated only from them (the Ahlul Bayt ), against the will of those who deny their merits, those who reject them, and antagonize (them and their followers) based on this. I seek help from Allāh in this and rely on Him. He is sufficient for me in all affairs and He is the best One on whom one can rely. Verily that which led to writing this book was your repeated requests (to do so) as well as my knowledge of the rewards and the nearness which I can attain to Allāh, His Messenger, ‘Ali, Fāťimah, and the Imams by writing this book, and to the rest of the believers through publishing these narrations and sharing them with my brothers from among the believers. I started to think about this (compilation) and focused my energy on it and asked Allāh, the Blessed and the Exalted, for help until I finished compiling it, using only the narrations of the Imams . I did not include anything which has been narrated from anyone else, for verily that which has been narrated from the Ahlul Bayt is sufficient; there is no need to narrate anything from others. We acknowledge that we cannot encompass everything which has been narrated from them about this topic (Ziyārah) or about any other topic (for that matter). Furthermore, I have only narrated that which was reported to me by the trustworthy ones from among our companions – may Allāh’s Mercy be upon them – and I did not include anything which has been reported by unknown or unreliable sources who are not well-known for their knowledge and narrations. I named this book Kāmil Al-Ziyārāt and I have divided it into (many) chapters. Each chapter is about a separate topic; all of the narrations in the chapter are related to the topic. This has been done to prevent confusing the reader. The reader does not need to worry about how to find something (specific) that he may be looking for. (Unfortunately) this has been the case with the books of some other authors who have named a chapter using a specific title but have (nevertheless) included that which is not related to it in that chapter to such an extent that sometimes there are chapters in their books which do not contain even one Ḥadīth which clearly explains the topic of the chapter. The reason I have organized the book in this specific way is to make it easier for those who are looking for a Ḥadīth about a particular topic. The reader can simply look at the titles of the chapters and find the Ḥadīth about the topic in question. The book was also organized so that the readers, those who study this book, and those who listen to the narrations in this book do not become weary (looking for something specific). (Finally), this work was compiled to inform people of that which Allāh has chosen for His friends from among those who go to the Ziyārah of the grave of Ḥusain and (the rest of) the Masters and to increase their desire to (attain nearness to) them and to go to their Ziyārah through seeking the great rewards and victory which Allāh, the Great and Almighty, has prepared for them. I ask Allāh for that which He is worthy of giving and I ask Him through His most beloved names to send His blessing on Muḥammad and his family and to reward me for this book with that which I have hoped for with His Mercy and His Generosity, and I ask him not to deprive me of it. May Allāh’s blessing be upon Muḥammad and his righteous and chosen family."

Then proceed to the grave of the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ and say Salām to him. Move to the pillar which is located on the right side by the head of the grave. Stand there with your left shoulder toward the grave, your right shoulder toward the pulpit of the Prophet ﷺ, and face QIBLAH, for this is the (closest) location to the head of the Prophet ﷺ. Then recite (the following): ﷺ I testify that there is no god but Allāh; He is alone and He has no partners, and I testify that Muḥammad ﷺ is His slave and messenger. I testify that you are the Messenger of Allāh and you are Muḥammad, son of ‘Abdillāh. I testify that you announced the messages of your Lord, you advised your nation, you fought in the way of Allāh, and you worshipped Allāh with wisdom and by giving good counsel until that which is certain (death) came to you. You fulfilled your obligations. You were kind toward the believers and harsh toward the disbelievers. Therefore, Allāh granted you the highest honoured position of the honourable ones. Praise be to Allāh who, through you, saved us from polytheism and from going astray. O Allāh! Send Your blessings, the blessings of Your high-ranked angels, the blessings of Your righteous slaves, the blessings of Your prophets who were sent as messengers, the blessings of (all of) the inhabitants of the heavens and the earths, and the blessings of everyone from the first to the last who sanctifies the Lord of the Worlds, on Muḥammad, Your slave, Your messenger, Your prophet, Your trustee, Your confidant, Your love, Your chosen one, Your special (slave), and the best of Your creation. O Allāh! Grant him the ladder and the WASǏLAH in Paradise, and resurrect him in the Praised Position which will be envied by everyone from the first to the last. : O Allāh! You said, “And had they, when they were unjust to themselves, come to you and asked forgiveness of Allāh and the Messenger had (also) asked forgiveness for them, they would have found Allāh Oft-returning (to mercy), Most Merciful” (4:64). And I have come to Your Prophet, repenting and asking for forgiveness for my sins, and I have turned to You through Your Prophet, the Prophet of Mercy, Muḥammad ﷺ. O Muḥammad! I have turned to Allāh, Your Lord and mine, through you, so that He forgives my sins. Then Imam continued: If you have a request, face the Qiblah with your back toward the grave. Raise your hands and ask for your request. (If you do this) your request will more likely be granted In-Shā`allāh."

Salām to you, O Lion of Allāh and the Lion of His Messenger ﷺ. I testify that you fought in the way of Allāh the way (in which) Allāh should be fought for; (I testify that) you were loyal to Allāh and His Messenger ﷺ and that you generously sacrificed yourself (for Allāh). You sought that which is with Allāh and (you) desired that which He has promised. After reciting the above, enter, and establish prayer but do not face the grave while you are praying. After you finish your prayers, fall to the grave and recite (the following): O Allāh! Send Your blessing on Muḥammad and his family. O Allāh! I have exposed myself to Your Mercy by clinging to the grave of the uncle of Your Prophet, may Your blessings be upon him and upon his family, so that You may protect me against Your Wrath, Your Vengeance, and Your Abhorrence; and (so that You may protect me) from slipping on the Day when there will be much clamour and humiliation, and every soul will be busy with that which it has brought forward (for itself), and every soul will try to defend (only) itself. (O Allāh!) If You include me in Your Mercy today, I shall not have any fear nor grief. However, if You decide to punish me, (You are) my Master who has power over His slave. O Allāh! Do not disappoint me today and do not send me back without fulfilling my needs, for I am clinging to the grave of the uncle of Your Prophet and I am seeking nearness to You through him, (and by doing so) I am seeking Your Pleasure and hoping for Your Mercy. Therefore, accept this (deed) from me and turn with Your Patience to my ignorance and with Your Kindness to the crimes which I have committed against myself. Verily my sins are great. I do not fear that You will oppress me; rather I fear a terrible reckoning. Therefore, take into consideration my restless movement on the grave of the uncle of Your Prophet – may Your blessings be upon Muḥammad and his family – and release me (from Hell) through them. Do not make my efforts futile; do not disgrace my invocation (to You); do not prevent my voice from (reaching) You; and do not send me back without fulfilling my needs. O saviour of every grief-stricken and anguished person! O one who comforts the heartbroken, the perplexed, and the stranger who is on the verge of perishing! Send Your blessing on Muḥammad and his purified family and look toward me in such a way that (it) prevents me from ever becoming wretched. (O Allāh!) Have mercy on (me through) my invocation and through my loneliness, for I have hoped (to gain) Your pleasure and I am seeking the good that cannot be given by anyone other than You. Therefore, do not disappoint me.

Then proceed to the Well of Um Ibrāhīm and pray there, for that is where the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ used to live and pray. Thereafter, proceed to the Mosque of Faďīkh and establish two RAK’AH of prayer, for your Prophet ﷺ has prayed there. When you are finished (visiting the mosques) on this side of the city, proceed to the side of Uḥud. Start by going to the mosque which is below Ḥarrah and establish prayers there. Then proceed to the grave of Ḥamzah, the son of ‘Abdil Muťťalib , and say Salām to him. Then go toward the graves of the rest of the martyrs of the Battle of Uḥud. Stand there and recite (the following): Salām to you, O inhabitants of the graves. You have preceded us and (soon) we shall join you. Thereafter, proceed to the mosque that is on the right side of the mountain (of Uḥud) and establish prayers there because the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ waited for the time of prayers and then prayed in this mosque before he moved toward the Battle of Uḥud to fight the polytheists. Then go back to the grave of the martyrs (of the Battle of Uḥud) and pray next to their graves as much as Allāh has written (willed) for you. Move toward the Mosque of Aḥzāb and establish prayers there, for the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ prayed in that mosque on the day of the Battle of Aḥzāb and said: O succour of the anguished ones! O fulfiller of the prayers of the distressed ones! O saviour of the heartbroken ones! Relieve me from my grief, my agony, my sadness, for You see my state and the state of my companions."

If you are going to stay in Madīnah for three days, fast three days, starting on a Wednesday. Pray Tuesday night next to the Pillar of Repentance (in the Mosque of the Prophet ﷺ) which is where Abū Lubābah tied himself until his forgiveness was revealed from the heavens. Then on Wednesday, (fast and) sit by the same pillar all day. At night, come next to the grave of the Prophet ﷺ and spend that night and the next day there, fasting on Thursday. Then on Thursday night, come to the pillar next to the grave of the Prophet ﷺ and establish prayers there throughout the night and throughout the day Friday. You should also fast on Friday. If possible, do not speak during these three days, except to say that which you have to say, and do not leave the mosque unless it is necessary. If you can, do not sleep at night or during the day, for this will add to the grace of this act. Then finally on Friday, praise Allāh, sanctify Him, send blessing on the Prophet ﷺ, and ask for your needs. The following should be recited along with your other supplications: . O Allāh! I come to You through Your Prophet, Muḥammad, the Prophet of Mercy, to fulfill all of my needs, from the smallest to the greatest. And (I ask You to fulfill) those needs which I hastened in asking and begging for, and (also to fulfill) those needs which I did not hasten to ask for, and (those needs) which I did not even ask to be fulfilled."

Then proceed to the Well of Um Ibrāhīm and pray there, for that is where the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ used to live and pray. Thereafter, proceed to the mosque of Faďīkh and pray two Rak’ah there, for your Prophet ﷺ has prayed there. When you are finished (visiting the mosques) on this side of the city, proceed to the side of Uḥud. Start by going to the mosque that is below Ḥarrah and establish prayers there. Thereafter, proceed to the grave of Ḥamzah, the son of ‘Abdil Muťťalib , and say Salām to him. Then go toward the graves of the rest of the martyrs of the Battle of Uḥud. Stand there and recite (the following): Salām to you, O inhabitants of the graves. You have preceded us and (soon) we shall join you. Thereafter, proceed to the mosque that is on the right side of the mountain (of Uḥud) and establish prayers there, for the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ waited for the time of prayers and then prayed in this mosque before he moved toward the Battle of Uḥud to fight the polytheists. Then go back to the grave of the martyrs (of the Battle of Uḥud) and pray next to their graves as much as Allāh has written (willed) for you. Move toward the Mosque of Aḥzāb and establish prayers there, for the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ prayed in that mosque on the day of the Battle of Aḥzāb and said: . O succour of the anguished ones! O fulfiller of the prayers of the distressed ones! O saviour of the heartbroken ones! Relieve me from my grief, my agony, my sadness, for You see my state and the state of my companions."

It was after sunset when he approached the grave of the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ from the direction of the head. He said Salām to the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ and clung to the grave. Then he came to the pulpit of the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ. Thereafter, he moved back to the grave and established prayers (so close to the grave that) his left shoulder touched the part of the grave which is close to a pillar. This pillar is situated on the opposite side of (another) pillar which is by the head of the Prophet ﷺ. He prayed six or eight Rak’ah while wearing his sandals and the length of his RUKŪ’ and SUJŪD was as long as reciting TASBǏḤĀT three or more times. After he finished his prayers, he prostrated for such a long time that the sand (on which he had prostrated) became moistened from his sweat. And some of our companions added that he was seen placing his cheek on the ground of the Mosque."

Do you know where you are right now?” “No,” he replied. “You are in front of the Mosque of Kūfān,” Jabra`īl said. “Ask Your Lord for permission so that I may descend here and pray in it,” the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ said. Then Jabra`īl asked for permission and it was granted. Therefore, the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ descended and prayed two Rak’ah in the Mosque of Kūfah. Then Imam continued: Establishing one obligatory prayer in it (the Mosque of Kūfah) is equal to establishing one thousand prayers (elsewhere), and establishing one recommended prayer in it is equal to establishing five hundred prayers (elsewhere). Verily the front portion of the Mosque of Kūfah is a garden from the gardens of Paradise; and its right side is a garden from the gardens of Paradise; and its left side is a garden from the gardens of Paradise; and its back portion is a garden from the gardens of Paradise. Even sitting in the Mosque of Kūfah without praying or praising Allāh is considered worshipping Him. If people knew its merits, they would surely come to it even if they had to crawl to it."

Did you see my uncle on the night of his uprising?” “Yes,” Abū Ḥamzah replied. “Did he pray in the Mosque of Suhayl?” Imam asked. “Where is the Mosque of Suhayl? Do you mean the Mosque of Sahlah?” Abū Ḥamzah asked. “Yes. Verily if he had prayed two Rak’ah there and then sought refuge with Allāh, he would have been protected by Allāh for one year,” the Imam said. “May I sacrifice my father and mother for you! Are you referring to this (known) Mosque of Sahlah?” Abū Ḥamzah asked. “Yes,” the Imam replied. Then Imam continued: (The Mosque of Sahlah) contains the house of Ibrāhīm where he used to rise against the giants. It contains the house of Idrīs where he used to sew. It contains the place where the rider ties his camel. It contains a green rock which has the pictures of all of the prophets within it, and the clay under this rock is the clay from which Allāh created all of the prophets. The MI’RĀJ (ascension) took place in (a part of this mosque known as) the great FĀRŪQ (separator). The Mosque of Sahlah is part of Kūfān and it is the route people will pass. The trumpet will be blown from it and (the people) will be resurrected toward it. Seventy thousand people will be resurrected from the side of the Mosque of Sahlah and they will enter Paradise without any judgment. They are those whom Allāh has set aright and upon whom He has increased His blessings. Verily they are the devout winners who will be rewarded before others. They love to repel any praise about themselves and they are terrified of meeting Allāh with His justice. They are quick in obeying Allāh, they perform good deeds, and they understand that Allāh sees what they do. There will not be any judgment nor torment for them. Verily Allāh removes the rancour and purifies the believers. The mountain of Ahwān, which is a very old mountain and which was populated in the past, started to move from the middle of this mosque."

Muḥammad ibn Aḥmad ibn ‘Ali ibn Ya’qūb narrated to me from ‘Ali ibn Ḥasan ibn ‘Ali ibn Faďďāl, from his father, from Ḥasan ibn Jahm ibn Bukayr, who said: I told Abal Ḥasan (Imam Kāżim ) about the way in which Yaḥyā ibn Mūsā bothers those who go to the Ziyārah of the Commander of the Believers . I explained that he goes to Thawiyyah for picnics and verily the grave of the Commander of the Believers is a little further than Thawiyyah. I told (the Imam ) that – based on the narration of Safwān Al-Jammāl – this is the place that Abū ‘Abdillāh (Imam Sādiq ) described to him (as follows): Once you arrive in the land of Gharī, which is behind Kūfah, turn your back to Gharī and move forward slightly to the right toward Najaf. When you come to the white-coloured gravel with the mountain road ahead of you, you will find the grave of the Commander of the Believers . I told the Imam that I had gone to that place many times but that some of our companions do not believe that the Commander of the Believers was buried there. Some believe that he was buried in the Mosque (of Kūfah) while others believe that he was buried in the palace (of Kūfah), but I always responded to them by saying that Allāh would not allow the grave of the Commander of the Believers to be in a palace, for it is the abode of oppressors, nor can it be in the mosque because his children wanted to hide his grave. I asked the Imam , “Which one of us is correct?” Imam replied, “You are correct because you have followed the words of Ja’far ibn Muḥammad (Imam Sādiq ). O Abā Muḥammad! None of our companions say that which you say or believe in that which you believe.” I asked, “May I sacrifice my life for you! Is this one of the (blessings of) Allāh (on me)?” Imam replied, “Yes. Verily Allāh gives success to and secures (from falsehood) whomever He wills. Therefore, praise Allāh and say, ‘This is a success from Allāh.” The above Ḥadīth had also been narrated to me through the following chain: Muḥammad ibn Ḥasan and Muḥammad ibn Aḥmad ibn Ḥusain, both from Ḥasan ibn ‘Ali ibn Mahziyār, from his father ‘Ali, from Ḥasan ibn ‘Ali ibn Faďďāl, from Ḥasan ibn Jahm ibn Bukayr, from Abil Ḥasan ."

Muḥammad ibn Ḥasan and Muḥammad ibn Aḥmad ibn Ḥusain both narrated to me from Ḥasan ibn ‘Ali ibn Mahziyār, from his father ‘Ali ibn Mahziyār, from ‘Ali ibn Aḥmad ibn Ashyam, (from someone), from Yūnus ibn Żabyān, who said: I was with Abī ‘Abdillāh (Imam Sādiq ) when he was (forcefully) taken to Abī Ja’far (Mansūr Al-Dawānīqi) in Ḥīrah. One clear and moonlit night, the Imam looked at the sky and said, “O Yūnus! Do you see how beautiful these stars are?! Verily they are the protection of the inhabitants of the skies, and we (the Ahlul Bayt) are the protection of the inhabitants on earth.” Then he asked me to order (the servants) to saddle the donkey and the mule. Once they were ready, Imam asked me which (sumpter) I would prefer to ride. I thought that Imam would prefer to ride the mule because it was stronger than the donkey, so I chose the donkey. However, Imam asked me to allow him to ride the donkey to which I agreed. Once we were outside Ḥīrah, Imam asked me to move ahead and I did. He kept instructing me to turn right and left until we came to some red-coloured gravel. Imam said, “This is the place.” Then the Imam moved slightly to the right. There was a well and some water there with which Imam performed Wuďū. Then he moved toward a mound and prayed next to it. Then he leaned over it and cried. Thereafter, he moved to a smaller mound which was next to the (first) mound. He repeated what he had done next to the first mound. Then he said to me, “O Yūnus! Do as I did.” I followed the order of the Imam . Thereafter, Imam asked me, “O Yūnus! Do you know where we are?” “No,” I replied. Imam said: The first place was the grave of the Commander of the Believers and the second place was where the head of Ḥusain ibn ‘Ali ibn Abī Ťālib was buried. After the cursed ‘Ubaydullāh ibn Ziyād – may Allāh’s curse be upon him – sent the head of Ḥusain to Shām, it was sent back to Kūfah. But ‘Ubaydullāh said, “Take the head out of Kūfah so that it does not cause disorder among its people.” However, Allāh placed the head next to the Commander of the Believers (and thereafter, it was joined with the body of Ḥusain ). Therefore, the head is with the body now and the body is with the head."

Muḥammad ibn Ya’qūb narrated to me from Abī ‘Ali Al-Ash’ari, from someone whose name he mentioned, from Muḥammad ibn Sinān, from Mufaďďal ibn ‘Umar, who said: I went to Abī ‘Abdillāh (Imam Sādiq ) and said, “I yearn for Gharī!” “Why do you yearn for it?” the Imam asked. “Because I love the Commander of the Believers and I love to go to his Ziyārah,” I replied. “Do you know the merits of going to his Ziyārah?” the Imam asked. “No, O son of the Messenger of Allāh! So teach me,” I said. “When you want to go to the Ziyārah of the Commander of the Believers , know that you will go to the Ziyārah of the bones of Ādam , the flesh of Nūḥ , and the body of ‘Ali ibn Abī Ťālib ,” the Imam said. “Ādam landed in Sarandīb in the middle of the day, and it is believed that his bones were next to Allāh’s Sacred House (Ka’bah). So how did his bones end up in Kūfah?” I asked. Imam replied: When Nūḥ was in the ark, Allāh, the Blessed and the Exalted, revealed to him to go to the Ka’bah and circulate around it for seven days. Nūḥ did as Allāh had ordered. Thereafter, he descended from the ark. He went into the water up to his knees until he brought out a coffin which contained the bones of Ādam . He brought it back with him to his ark. He continued circulating around the Ka’bah for as long as Allāh had willed. Then he moved toward Kūfah. He went inside the Mosque of Kūfah (with his ark) and stopped in the middle. This is where Allāh revealed to the earth, “Swallow your water” (11:44). Therefore, the earth swallowed its water starting from the Mosque of Kūfah, which is where the flood had (originally) begun. Then those who were with Nūḥ in the ark each went in different directions. Nūḥ carried the coffin and buried it in Gharī which is part of the mountain on which Allāh spoke to Mūsā , purified ‘Isā , chose Ibrāhīm as His friend, and chose Muḥammad ﷺ as His love. Allāh chose that land as the abode of the prophets. I swear to Allāh that no one more honourable than the Commander of the Believers has ever lived there after (the time of) his purified fathers, Ādam and Nūḥ . Therefore, when you want to go to Najaf, go to the Ziyārah of the bones of Ādam, the flesh of Nūḥ, and the body of ‘Ali ibn Abī Ťalib . By doing so, you will have gone to the Ziyārah of the first fathers, of Muḥammad ﷺ (who is) the last of the prophets, and of ‘Ali (who is) the Master of the Successors. Verily the doors of the heavens will be opened for those who go to the Ziyārah of the Commander of the Believers , so do not hold back from this great (fortune). The above Ḥadīth has also been narrated to me through the following chain: Muḥammad ibn ‘Abdillāh ibn Ja’far Al-Ḥimyari, from his father, from Muḥammad ibn Ḥusain ibn Abil Khaťťāb, from (Muḥammad) ibn Sinān, from Mufaďďal ibn ‘Umar, from Abī ‘Abdillāh ."

He stood by the grave, cried, and then said: Salām to you and (may) Allāh’s Mercy and His Blessings be upon you, O Commander of the Believers! Salām to you, O Trustee of Allāh in His land and His Decisive Proof on His slaves. ﷺ Salām to you, O Commander of the Believers! I testify that you fought in the way of Allāh the way (in which) He should be fought for and your deeds were based on the Book of Allāh. You followed the traditions of His Prophet ﷺ until Allāh called you to His side and chose to take you to Himself. He obliged your enemies to the argument of killing you, in addition to many (other) clear arguments that you already have over all of His creation. . O Allāh! Make my soul certain about that which You have predestined, pleased with Your decree, fond of Your remembrance and supplication, loving toward Your Chosen Divine Authorities, and loved on Your land and in Your heavens, patient during Your trials, and thankful for Your gracious blessings. (Make me) remember Your abundant bounties, yearn for the happiness of meeting You, equipped with piety for the day of Your reward, follow the traditions of Your Divine Authorities, avoid the manners of Your enemies, and preoccupied from (loving) the world through Your sanctification and praise. Then he placed his cheek on the grave of the Commander of the Believers and said: O Allāh! The hearts of those who humble themselves before You are filled with a confounding fascination. The paths of those who desire You are made level. The signs for those who seek You are clear. The hearts of those who know You are filled with fear of You. The voices of those who call You are raised to You. The gates through which You answer them are open to them. The prayers of those who whisper to You are fulfilled. The repentance of those who return to You is accepted. The tears of those who weep in fear of You are dealt with mercifully. Assistance is available to those who seek it from You. Refuge is generously given to those who seek refuge with You. Your promises to Your slaves are fulfilled. The errors of those who ask You to reduce their errors are reduced. The good deeds of those who perform (them) are preserved with You. The sustenance of Your creation descends on them from You and their shares are increased continuously. The sins of those who seek forgiveness are forgiven and the needs of Your creation are fulfilled by You. The rewards of the beseechers are available in plenty with You, and (even) further benefits reach Your creation. The tables of food are prepared for those who seek it and fountains are filled for the thirsty. O Allāh! Answer my prayers, accept my praise, fulfill my hopes, and unite me with the Divine Authorities (You have appointed) on me through the right of Muḥammad, ‘Ali, Fāťimah, Ḥasan, and Ḥusain . Verily You are the Master of my bounties, my utmost desire, and my utmost hope in my ultimate end and my final abode. You are my God, my Lord, and my Master. Forgive me and (forgive) our friends. Keep our enemies away from us and distract them from harming us. Manifest the word of truth and make it the supreme word; let the word of falsehood be refuted, making it inferior. Verily You have power over all things."

Muḥammad ibn Ḥasan ibn Walīd narrated to me as part of the narrations in his book, Kitāb Al-Jāmi’, that it is narrated that: Abul Ḥasan (Imam Kāżim ) used to recite the following next to the grave of the Commander of the Believers : Salām to you, O WALǏ of Allāh. I testify that you are the first one who was oppressed and you are the first one whose right was usurped. You stayed patient, anticipating the rewards from Allāh until that which is certain (death) came to you. I testify that you met Allāh as a martyr. May Allāh torment your killer with various kinds of chastisements and may He renew the torment of your killer. I have come to you while I am aware of your right and endowed with insight into your status. I antagonize your enemies and those who oppressed you. Allāh-willing, I shall meet my Lord in this very state. : O my master! I have many sins, so intercede for me with your Lord, for verily you have a known position and a great status with Allāh and you have the power of intercession with Allāh. Indeed Allāh, the Exalted, has said, “And they offer no intercession except for those whom He approves” (21:28). He (Imam Kāżim ) would also recite the following next to the grave of the Commander of the Believers : Praise be to Allāh who – through His Mercy and Generosity toward me – honoured me by allowing me to know Him, to know His Messenger ﷺ, and to know those whose obedience Allāh has made mandatory on me; and He bestowed me with ǏMĀN (faith). Praise be to Allāh who allowed me to travel in His land and allowed me to ride His conveyance. He made the far near for me and kept danger away from me until I entered the sacred sanctuary of the brother of His Messenger ﷺ, and He allowed me to visit it in good health. Praise be to Allāh who has made me among the visitors of the grave of the successor of His Messenger ﷺ. Praise be to Allāh who has guided us here, and if it was not for Allāh’s guidance, we would not have been guided. I testify that there is no god but Allāh and He has no partners. I testify that Muḥammad ﷺ is His slave and messenger who came with (the) truth from Allāh. And I testify that ‘Ali is His slave and the brother of His Messenger ﷺ. O Allāh! Your slave and Your visitor seeks nearness to You by coming to the Ziyārah of the grave of the brother of Your Prophet. Every host has a duty to those who visit him, and You are the best One to visit and You are the most honourable host. O Allāh! O Raḥmān! O Raḥīm! O Generous! O One! O Alone! O Unique! O Independent! O He who does not beget nor is He begotten and there is none like Him! I ask You to send Your blessing on Muḥammad, the family of Muḥammad, and the people of his household. Make my gift for coming to the Ziyārah of this site my release from Hell. And make me among those who “hasten to do good works” (2:148), among those who pray to You with desire and fear, and among those who humble themselves before You. : O Allāh! You have given me glad tidings through the tongue of Your Messenger, Muḥammad ﷺ, saying, “Give glad tidings to those who believe that there is a sure footing for them with their Lord” (10:2). O Allāh! I believe in You and I am certain (in my belief) of all of Your prophets. Because I have acknowledged them, do not stop me (on the Day of Judgment) on a stand where You expose me in front of the witnesses. Rather, allow me to stand next to them (the prophets). Take my life while I believe in them, for verily they are Your slaves and You have designated them to be honoured and ordered me to follow them. Then come close to the grave and recite (the following): Salām from Allāh upon Muḥammad ibn ‘Abdillāh ﷺ, Allāh’s Trustee of His revelation and His firmly determined affairs, the source of revelation and the inspiration, the last of that which has passed and the one who began that which is yet to come, and the absolute master over all of it, the witness of the creation, and the shining light. Salām to him, and (may) Allāh’s Mercy and His Blessings be upon him. O Allāh! Send the best, the most perfect, the highest, and the most honourable of the blessings that You have bestowed upon any of Your prophets, messengers, or Your chosen (slaves) on Muḥammad and his oppressed family. O Allāh! Send Your blessing on ‘Ali, the Commander of the Believers, Your slave, the best of Your creation after Your Prophet, the brother and the heir of Your Messenger, the one whom You chose from Your creation after Your Prophet, the guide to those with whom You sent Your messages, the undisputed ruler of the religion with Your justice, and the Decisive Judgment between Your creation. Salām to him and (may) Allāh’s Mercy and Blessings be upon him. O Allāh! Send Your blessing on the Imams from his sons who fulfill Your Affairs after him, the purified ones with whom You are pleased as the supporters of Your religion, as the keepers of Your secret, as the witnesses over Your creation, and as the flags (of guidance) for Your slaves. Send as many blessings on them as you can (at this point) and recite (the following): Salām upon the entrusted Imams. Salām upon the pure ones from the creation of Allāh. Salām upon the insightful Imams. Salām upon the believers who fulfilled Your command, who supported the Divine Authorities appointed by Allāh, and who were fearful when they were fearful. Salām upon Allāh’s high-ranked angels. Then recite (the following): Salām to you and (may) Allāh’s Mercy and Blessings be upon you, O Commander of the Believers! Salām to you, O love of Allāh! Salām to you, O choice of Allāh (from among His creation)! Salām to you, O Walī of Allāh! Salām to you, O Allāh’s Decisive Proof! Salām to you, O pillar of the religion and the heir of the knowledge of the first to the last (one)! Salām to you, O Owner of the MAYSAM and O SIRĀŤ’ AL-MUSTAQǏM (the straight path)! I testify that you established prayers, gave charity, enjoined goodand forbade evil, followed the Messenger ﷺ, recited the Book (Qur’an) the way it is worthy of being recited, fought in the way of Allāh the way (in which) He should be fought for, and were sincere to Allāh and His Messenger ﷺ. (I testify that) you sacrificed yourself, patiently seeking the reward with Allāh, fighting for the religion of Allāh, protecting the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ, wishing for that which is with Allāh, and desiring (the reward) promised by Allāh. And you died the way you lived – as a martyr, who is the witness (over the people) and who is witnessed (by Allāh). May Allāh reward you with the best of the rewards on behalf of His Messenger ﷺ, Islam, and its nation. (May) Allāh’s curse be upon those who killed you. (May) Allāh’s curse be upon those who were against you. (May) Allāh’s curse be upon those who forged lies against you and oppressed you. (May) Allāh’s curse be upon those who usurped your right and upon those who heard about the usurpation of your right and were pleased with it. I seek nearness to Allāh by dissociating myself from them. (May) Allāh’s curse be upon the nation who opposed you, upon the nation that denied your Wilāyah, upon the nation that rebelled against you, upon the nation that killed you, and upon the nation that deviated (away) from you and disappointed you. Praise be to Allāh who made Hell their abode, and what an evil destination is Hell! And what an evil destination they shall enter! What a lowly place is their lowest place! O Allāh! Curse the killers of Your prophets and the successors of Your prophets with all of Your (different) curses and burn them with Your blazing fires. O Allāh! Curse all of the Jibt(s), Ťāghūt(s), and the pharaohs; and Lāt, ‘Uzzā, and Jibt; and every other object which is worshipped besides Allāh; and everyone who forges a lie against Allāh. O Allāh! Increasingly curse them, curse those who follow them and obey them, and curse their friends, their supporters, and their lovers. Then say three times: O Allāh! Curse the killers of the Commander of the Believers . O Allāh! Curse the killers of Ḥasan and Ḥusain . O Allāh! Torment them with a chastisement that is so painful that You will never punish anyone else with it. Increasingly multiply their punishment because of the way in which they afflicted Your appointed authorities. Prepare a punishment for them that You have never inflicted on anyone from (among) Your creation. O Allāh! Cast a growing torment in the lowest levels of the blazing fires on those who killed the supporters of Your Prophet, those who killed the supporters of the Commander of the Believers, those who killed the supporters of Ḥasan and Ḥusain , and on the killers of those who have been killed in the way of the Wilāyah of the family of Muḥammad. (Cast) an undiminishing torment which will render (these killers) hopeless and cursed, with their heads lowered in disgrace before their Lord, seeing how their remorse and disgrace will last forever for having killed the progeny of Your prophets and messengers and Your righteous slaves from among their followers. O Allāh! Curse them (at all times), secretly and openly, in Your land and in Your heavens. O Allāh! Make me truthful in my words about Your Divine Authorities and make me love their sites until You make me join them. And make me follow them in this life and in the Hereafter, O the Most Merciful of the merciful ones! Then sit next to his head and recite (the following): Salām of Allāh and His high-ranked angels to you, O my master! (Salām of those angels) who submit with their hearts to you, extol your virtues, and testify to your honesty, loyalty, and veracity. Salām from Allāh to you, your soul, and your body. I testify that you are the (embodiment of) purity; you are pure and purified. O Walī of Allāh and Walī of His Messenger! I testify that you announced (the decree of Allāh) and you fulfilled (your duties). I testify that you are the side of Allāh (the nearest to Allāh), you are the door to Allāh, you are Allāh’s face through which He is approached, you are the friend of Allāh, and you are the slave of Allāh and the brother of His Messenger. I have come to visit you because of how great your position and status is with Allāh and His Messenger. I have come to visit you seeking nearness with Allāh, requesting salvation, seeking refuge with you from the fire which the likes of me have deserved for my crimes against myself. I have come (solely) to you and to your son, the heir after you – referring to the Imam of the time – with the blessing of Ḥaqq (the truth) and with hope in no one else. My heart is submissive to you, I follow your commands, and I am prepared to support you. I am the slave of Allāh and your servant, ready to obey you. I have come to you as your guest, seeking perfection of my status with Allāh. O my master! You are the one whom Allāh has ordered me to obey and (to whom Allāh) has exhorted me to be loyal, and whose grace (Allāh) has manifested for me. He has guided me to loving you and has given me the desire to visit you and to ask for (the fulfillment of) my needs next to you. You are the members of the household whose lovers are blessed. Those who come to you will not be disappointed and those who desire you will not lose. However, those who antagonize you will not achieve success. I cannot find anyone more beneficent than you with whom to seek refuge. You are the family of mercy, the pillars of the religion, the support of the earth, and the blessed tree. O Allāh! Do not thwart my approach to You through Your Messenger and his family. O Allāh! You bestowed Your favours upon me through the Ziyārah of my master, through his Wilāyah, and through knowing him. Therefore, make me among those whom You will support and with whom victory will be achieved. Favour me by (allowing me) to support Your religion in this life and in the Hereafter. O Allāh! Make me live the same way that ‘Ali ibn Abī Ťālib lived and make me die on the same path that ‘Ali ibn Abī Ťālib died."

And how can you be anything other than this, for you are the son of the (Prophet of) guidance, you are (the most) devoted to piety, and you are one of the five Asḥāb Al-Kisā (people of the cloak). You were fed by the hands of mercy, you were raised in the lap of Islam, and you were nursed from the bosom of faith. You were blessed when you were alive and you are blessed after your death, except that our souls are miserable in being separated from you. However, we do not have any doubts that you are alive. May Allāh’s Mercy be upon you. Then he would look at Ḥusain and say, “O Abā ‘Abdillāh! May Salām be upon Abī Muḥammad (Imam Ḥasan )!”"

Ḥukaym ibn Dāwūd ibn Ḥukaym narrated to me from Salamah, from ‘Abdillāh ibn Aḥmad, from Bakr ibn Sāliḥ, from ‘Amr ibn Hishām, from some of our companions, who said: One of them (the infallible Imams ) said: When you go to the Ziyārah of the graves of the Imams in Baqī’, stand next to their graves facing them, with your back toward Qiblah and recite (the following): Salām to you, O the Imams of Guidance! Salām to you, O People of Devotion and Piety! Salām to you, O the Decisive Proofs on the people of the world! Salām to you, O the Just Custodians of Creation! Salām to you, O Chosen Ones! Salām to you, O the Family of the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ! Salām to you, O Confidants (of Allāh)! I testify that you announced (the message of Allāh), you advised (the people), and you stayed patient in (the way of) Allāh. You were belied and insulted but you forgave. I testify that you are the wise Imams who are rightly guided, that obeying you is obligatory, and that your words are the truth. You called the people (toward Allāh) but your call was not answered, and you commanded the people but you were not obeyed. Verily you are the supporters of the religion and the pillars of the earth. Allāh has always watched over you, and He transferred you from the backbones of the purified fathers to the wombs of the purified mothers. The darkness of paganism did not defile you and afflictions (which are often a result) of (one’s) desires did not affect you. You were blessed and the places in which you were raised were also blessed. The Undisputed Ruler of Religion has bestowed favours upon us through you and through placing you “in houses which Allāh has permitted to be exalted, and His name to be remembered therein” (24:36). Allāh has made our SALAWĀT on you as (a form of) mercy on us and penance for our sins. Verily Allāh has chosen you (as Imams) for us. He has purified our creation by bestowing His favours upon us through your Wilāyah. We were named by Allāh as those who know you and we are known (by Allāh) as those who acknowledge your Imamate. I am in the position of one who has been excessive and who has made mistakes, but has surrendered, confessed to his crimes, and hopes to be saved through being here. (I am) one who hopes that the Saviour of those ruined (by their sins) will save him from destruction through you. Therefore, intercede on my behalf, for I have come to you while the people of this world have abandoned you, have mocked the signs of Allāh, and have arrogantly turned away from them. O One who is (always) in charge (of the affairs) and is never neglectful! O One who is everlasting and never distracted! O One who encompasses all things! You have favoured me by giving me the success of knowing my Imams and by keeping me steady on this (belief), while Your (other) slaves have turned away from it, ignored knowing it, belittled the rights of this belief, and have turned to other paths. Therefore, the favour is from You to me and to certain nations for whom You have chosen that which You have chosen for me. Praise be to You for registering me for this position. Do not deprive me of that which I hope for and do not disappoint me in this position (by not granting) my requests through the honour of Muḥammad ﷺ and his purified family. Then pray for that which you want."

Then Imam continued: Have you ever seen a mother in this world being averse to giving birth to a son?! Her aversion came from knowing that he would be killed. This verse was revealed about him (Ḥusain ), “We have enjoined on man to do good to his parents; his mother bears him with aversion, and with aversion she gives birth to him; and bearing him and weaning him takes thirty months” (46:15)."

My father narrated to me from Sa’d ibn ‘Abdillāh, from Muḥammad ibn Ḥammād, from his brother Aḥmad ibn Ḥammād, from Muḥammad ibn ‘Abdillāh, from his father, who said: I heard Abā ‘Abdillāh (Imam Sādiq ) say: Jabra`īl came to the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ and said, “Salām to you, O Muḥammad! Should I give you glad tidings of a son who will be killed by your nation after you?” The Messenger of Allāh ﷺ replied, “I do not need such a son.” Jabra`īl ascended to the heavens and then came back to him again, repeating what he had said. The Messenger of Allāh ﷺ replied, “I do not need such a son.” Jabra`īl ascended to the heavens (yet) again and then came back to him for the third time, repeating what he had said. The Messenger of Allāh ﷺ replied, “I do not need such a son.” Jabra`īl said, “Verily your Lord has placed the succession in his progeny.” The Messenger of Allāh ﷺ said, “Yes, (I accept).” Then the Prophet ﷺ went to Fāťimah (s.a.) and said, “Jabra`īl came to me and gave me glad tidings of a son who will be killed by my nation after me.” Fāťimah (s.a.) replied, “I do not need such a son.” The Messenger of Allāh ﷺ said to her, “Verily my Lord has placed the succession in his progeny.” Fāťimah (s.a.) replied, “In this case, yes (I will accept).” Therefore, Allāh revealed this verse, “His mother bears him with aversion, and with aversion she gives birth to him” (46:15) because Jabra`īl informed her that he would be killed. So “his mother bears him with aversion” because he would be killed. “And with aversion she gives birth to him” because (she knew) he would be killed."

Muḥammad ibn Ja’far Al-Razzāz narrated to me from Muḥammad ibn Ḥusain ibn Abil Khaťťāb, from Muḥammad ibn ‘Amr ibn Sa’īd Al-Zayyāt, from one of our companions, who said: Abū ‘Abdillāh (Imam Sādiq ) said: Jabra`īl came to the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ and said, “O Muḥammad! Verily Allāh conveys His Salām to you and gives you glad tidings of a newborn son from Fāťimah who will be killed by your nation after you.” The Prophet ﷺ replied, “O Jabra`īl! Salām be upon my Lord! I do not need a newborn son from Fāťimah who will be killed by my nation after me.” Jabra`īl ascended to the heavens and then came back to him again, repeating what he had said. The Prophet ﷺ replied, “O Jabra`īl! Salām be upon my Lord! I do not need a newborn son who will be killed by my nation after me.” Jabra`īl ascended to the heavens (yet) again and then came back to him for the third time and said, “O Muḥammad! Verily your Lord conveys His Salām to you and gives you glad tidings that He has placed the Imamate, the Wilāyah, and the succession in his progeny.” The Prophet ﷺ said, “I have accepted.” Then the Prophet ﷺ sent (this message) to Fāťimah (s.a.), “Verily Allāh has given me glad tidings of a newborn son to whom you will give birth and who will be killed by my nation after me.” Fatima replied, “I do not need a newborn son to whom I will give birth and who will be killed by your nation after you.” The Prophet ﷺ sent (this message) to her, “Verily Allāh has placed the Imamate, the Wilāyah, and the succession in his progeny.” Fāťimah (s.a.) replied, “I have accepted.” Then Imam Sadiq recited the following verse: His mother bears him with aversion, and with aversion she gives birth to him; and bearing him and weaning him takes thirty months. When he attains maturity, and reaches the age of forty, he says, ‘My Lord, arouse me that I may thank you for the bounties You have bestowed on me and my parents, and that I may do good which pleases You, and make (some of) my offspring righteous (as favour) for me’ (46:15). If he (Hussain ) would have said, “make [all of] my offspring righteous” then all of his offspring would have become Imams. Then Imam continued: Ḥusain was not breastfed by Fāťimah (s.a.) or any other woman. He used to be taken to the Prophet ﷺ and the Prophet ﷺ would place his thumb in the mouth of Ḥusain ; he would suck on the thumb of the Prophet ﷺ (long enough) to suffice him for two or three days. Therefore, the flesh of Ḥusain grew (and developed) from the flesh of the Prophet ﷺ and the blood of Ḥusain was made from the blood of the Prophet ﷺ. No one has been born after a gestation period of only six months except for ‘Isā, son of Maryam , and Ḥusain, son of ‘Ali . The above Ḥadīth has also been narrated to me trough the following chain: My father, from Sa’d ibn ‘Abdillāh, from ‘Ali ibn Ismā’īl ibn ‘Isā, from Muḥammad ibn ‘Amr ibn Sa’īd Al-Zayyāt, from one of our companions, from Abī ‘Abdillāh ."

She asked him, “What is upsetting you?” He replied, “Jabra`īl informed me that my nation will kill Ḥusain.” (When Fāťimah (s.a.) heard this), she became extremely grieved and restless.

However, at the end of his last Sujūd, he began to cry profusely. Because of our respect and reverence for him, we did not ask him why he was crying. However Ḥusain went and sat on his lap and said, “O Father! When you entered our house (today), we felt a happiness that we had never felt before. But then you started to cry and your crying has grieved us. What made you cry?” The Prophet ﷺ replied, “O my son! Jabra`īl came to me just now and informed me that you will all be killed and the places of your martyrdom will be far from one another.” Ḥusain asked, “O Father! What is the reward for those who come to the Ziyārah of our graves although they are far from one another?” The Prophet ﷺ replied: O my son! Verily there will be some groups from my nation who will come to your Ziyārah seeking blessings. By doing so, they will deserve to be visited by me on the Day of Judgment. I will save them from the terrors of the Hour (Day of Judgment) and from their sins. Verily Allāh will make them dwell in Paradise."

We offered some food to him. We also offered him a platter filled with dates and a goblet filled with milk and butter, which Um Ayman had sent to us. After he finished eating, I stood up and poured water over his hands. He washed his hands and then wiped his face and beard with the remainder of the water on his hands. Then he went to the (designated) place of prayer in the corner of the house and started praying. He fell into Sujūd and started to cry. After crying for a long time, he raised his head. None of us, the Ahlul Bayt, dared to ask him anything. However, Ḥusain moved (toward the Prophet ﷺ) and climbed on the lap of the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ. He placed the head of the Prophet ﷺ over his chest with his chin on the head of the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ. Then he said, “O Father! What makes you cry?” The Prophet ﷺ replied: O my son! When I saw you (the Ahlul Bayt) today I felt a happiness that I had never felt before, but then Jabra`īl came down to me and informed me that you will all be killed and that your graves will be far from each other. So I praised Allāh and asked Him to bless you (the Ahlul Bayt) with the best of all things. Ḥusain asked, “O father! Then who will come to the Ziyārah of our graves and stay committed to them even though they will be far from each other?” The Prophet ﷺ replied, “Those from my nation who seek to please me and connect with me by coming to your graves. On the Day of Judgment, I will find them and take them by their arms and save them from the difficulties and terrors of that day.”"

Jabra`īl informed him that his nation would kill Ḥusain , so the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ became restless. Jabra`īl said, “Should I not show you the land on which he will be killed?” Then the land (between Karbalā and Madīnah) sunk within the ground and the place where the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ was sitting (in Madīnah) and the land on which Ḥusain was killed became attached to one another. Then Jabra`īl took some of the dust (of Karbalā). Thereafter, the earth returned to the way it (originally) was in less than a blink of an eye. The Prophet ﷺ left while saying, “Bliss for you, O dust! And bliss for those who will be killed on you!” Imam continued: The companion of Sulaymān (Āsaf ibn Barkhiyā) also did the same thing. He mentioned the Great Name of Allāh and the earth between Sulaymān’s bed and the throne (of Bilqīs) sank within the ground. The earth and all of its flexible and inflexible parts sank within the ground, and Āsif lifted the throne (of Bilqīs) before the two pieces of land were attached. So Sulaymān said, “It looks like it (the throne of Bilqīs) came out from under my bed.” Imam added: Thereafter, the earth returned to the way it (originally) was in less than a blink of an eye."

And (was there any angel) who did not go to the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ, carrying some of the dust on which Ḥusain fell, was injured, slaughtered, killed, and on which he was abandoned?! The Messenger of Allāh ﷺ used to say, “O Allāh!

He died suddenly with a crisis. He spent the night while he was drunk and he was found dead and deformed in the morning as if he was coated with tar. Anyone who followed the order of Yazīd in killing Ḥusain or anyone who participated in fighting Ḥusain became insane or was afflicted with leprosy which became a hereditary disease in their progeny.

Verily he was (ever) true of his promise, and he was a messenger, and a prophet’ (19:54), Ismā’īl, the son of Ibrāhīm , because the people believe that it is?” Imam replied, “Ismā’īl died before Ibrāhīm . Ibrāhīm was Allāh’s Decisive Proof and he was an owner of a SHARǏ’AH (a set of laws of religion). So then to whom was Ismā’īl sent?!” I asked, “May I sacrifice my life for you! Then to whom is this verse referring?!” Imam replied: It refers to Ismā’īl, son of Prophet Ḥizqīl . Allāh sent him to his people but they belied him, killed him, and skinned his face. So Allāh’s Wrath fell upon them. Allāh sent Saťāťā`īl, the Angel of Chastisement, to Ismā’īl . The angel said, “O Ismā’īl! I am Saťāťā`īl, the Angel of Chastisement. The Lord of Glory has sent me to you to torment your nation with different kinds of chastisement, if you wish.” “I do not want this,” Ismā’īl replied. “O Ismā’īl! What do you want then?” Allāh revealed to him. Ismā’īl replied: O Lord! You have taken the covenant (from the creation) to accept You as the Lord, Muḥammad ﷺ as the Prophet, and his successors as the Divine Authorities. And You informed the Best of Your Creation (the Prophet ﷺ) about that which his nation would do to Ḥusain ibn ‘Ali after him. And You promised Ḥusain that You would bring him back in this life so that he can seek revenge against those who killed him. O my Lord! My wish is that You bring me back to life just as You will bring Ḥusain back to life, so that I can seek revenge against those who did this to me. Imam continued, “Allāh promised Ismā’īl ibn Ḥizqīl that He would bring him back to life. Therefore, Ismā’īl will return to life with Ḥusain .”"

(On his way to the Prophet ﷺ) Jabra`īl descended on an island in the sea where an angel named Fuťrus lived. Fuťrus was one of the carriers (of the Throne). At one point, he had procrastinated about carrying out an order of Allāh. Therefore, his wings were broken and he was thrown onto this island. He continued worshipping Allāh on that island for six hundred years, after which Ḥusain was born. Fuťrus asked him, “Where are you going?” “Allāh has blessed Muḥammad ﷺ with a blessing (child), and I have been sent to congratulate him on behalf of Allāh and myself,” Jabra`īl replied. “O Jabra`īl! Take me with you. Perhaps Muḥammad ﷺ will intercede for me,” Fuťrus said. So Jabra`īl carried Fuťrus. When they arrived, Jabra`īl congratulated the Prophet ﷺ on behalf of Allāh and himself, and then informed him of Fuťrus. The Messenger of Allāh ﷺ told Jabra`īl to bring Fuťrus inside. After Fuťrus was brought inside, he informed the Prophet ﷺ of his situation. The Prophet ﷺ prayed for him and said to him, “Rub (your wings) on this newborn child (Ḥusain ) and (you will) return to your (original) position.” Fuťrus rubbed his wings on Ḥusain and started ascending (to the heavens). As he was ascending, he said, “O Messenger of Allāh! Verily your nation will kill him. Verily, as my repayment to him (Ḥusain ), no one will come to his Ziyārah, say Salām to him, or send blessing(s) on him without me informing him of it.” Then Fuťrus ascended (to the heavens)."

Two of your Hajj?” ‘Āyishah asked. “Yes, even four (of my Hajj),” the Prophet ﷺ replied. ‘Āyishah kept on asking and the Prophet ﷺ kept on increasing the rewards until the Prophet ﷺ counted (the reward of the Ziyārah of Ḥusain equal) to ninety of his Hajj as well as ninety of his ‘Umrah."

Muḥammad ibn ‘Abdillāh ibn Ja’far Al-Ḥimyari narrated to me from his father, from ‘Ali ibn Muḥammad ibn Sālim, from Muḥammad ibn Khālid, from ‘Abdillāh ibn Ḥammād Al-Basri, from ‘Abdillāh ibn ‘Abdil Raḥmān Al-Asam, from Misma’ ibn ‘Abdil Malik, who said: Abū ‘Abdillāh (Imam Sādiq ) said: Fāťimah (s.a.) was carrying Ḥusain one day when the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ took him from her. He said (to Ḥusain ), “Allāh’s curse be upon those who (will) kill you. Allāh’s curse be upon those who (will) loot you. May Allāh destroy those who (will) help one another against you. May Allāh judge between me and those who (will) support others against you.” Fāťimah (s.a.) asked, “O father! What are you saying?!” The Prophet ﷺ replied: O My daughter! I remembered the tragedies that will befall him after me and you, and how he will be hurt, oppressed, betrayed, and violated. When this happens, he will be accompanied by a group (of people) who are like the stars of the sky, and (they) will be led toward death. The Prophet ﷺ continued, “It is as if I can see their camp, the place where they will dismount from their sumpters, and their dust.” Fāťimah (s.a.) asked, “O father! Where is this place you are describing?” The Prophet ﷺ replied: It is a land called Karbalā. It is the land of (KARB) agony and (BALĀ) affliction for us and for the nation. The most wicked ones from my nation will rise against them (Ḥusain and his companions). Even if all of the inhabitants of the heavens and the earths intercede for one of those who rise against Ḥusain , their intercession will not be accepted, and they will abide in Hell eternally. Fāťimah (s.a.) asked, “O father! So he (Ḥusain ) will be killed?” The Prophet (s.a.) replied: Yes, O my daughter. No one has ever been killed (or will be killed) other than Ḥusain on whom the heavens, the earths, the mountains, the angels, the beasts, and the whales in the oceans (will) cry. And if these created beings had been given permission (to destroy everything to avenge Ḥusain ), no living object would have survived (after the killing of Ḥusain ). (Verily) a group of people who love us will go to him (his Ziyārah). (Verily) no one on earth knows Allāh better than they do and no one is more committed to our rights than they are. (Verily) no one on earth other than them will pay attention to Ḥusain . (Verily) they are the lights in the darkness of oppression. They are the intercessors and they are those who will join me by my Pool tomorrow (on the Day of Judgment). I will recognize them by their marks when I see them (on the Day of Judgment). (On that day) the followers of every religion will look for their leaders and they (those who go to the Ziyārah of Ḥusain ) will look for no one other than us. They are the pillars of the earth, and the rains shower down through them."

Suddenly the Prophet ﷺ started to cry and fell in Sujūd. (After raising his head) he said: O Fāťimah, daughter of Muḥammad! (Allāh) the Most High, the Most Exalted just appeared to me in your house in the most beautiful form and appearance and asked me, “O Muḥammad! Do you love Ḥusain ?” I replied, “He is the light of my eyes, the fruit of my heart, my flower (in this life), and the skin between my two eyes.” Allāh said: O Muḥammad! – and He placed His hand on the head of Ḥusain – Blessed is this newborn baby upon whom I have sent My prosperity, blessings, mercy, and pleasure. And My blame, curse, wrath, chastisement, disgrace, and punishment are upon those who antagonize him, fight him, incite (the people) against him, and kill him. Verily he is the Master of Martyrs from the first to the last in this life and in the Hereafter. Verily he is the Master of the Youth of Paradise from among all of the creation and his father is more graceful and higher (in rank) than he is. (O Muḥammad!) Convey My Salām to him and give him glad tidings that he is the flag of My guidance, the lighthouse for My friends, My trustee and witness over My creation, the keeper of My knowledge, and My Decisive Proof on the inhabitants of the heavens and the earths, and on all of mankind and Jinn."

Seventy thousand angels will be alarmed in every sky through which the soul of Ḥusain will pass (after he will be killed).

There is a Shayťān rooted in every strand of hair on your head and in your beard and there is a baby sheep in your house who will kill my son, Ḥusain .” (‘Abd Al-Samīn/Asbagh added), “’Umar ibn Sa’d (the killer of Imam Ḥusain ) was a child then and he was playing in front of his father (Sa’d ibn Abī Waqqās).”"

When my father entered (the palace), Hishām said, “O Abā Ja’far! I have brought you here to ask you a question that should not be asked by anyone other than me. I do not think that it is possible for anyone to know of this matter nor do I think that anyone is even capable of knowing of this matter except for one man.” My father said, “The commander of the believers can ask me whatever he wishes. If I know the answer, I will answer it. And if I do not, I will say that I do not know, for truth is more worthy of being told.” Hishām asked: Tell me about the night on which ‘Ali ibn Abī Ťālib was killed. How did those who were absent from the city in which he was killed learn of his killing? And what was the sign of his death (that appeared) for the people? If you know the answer, then tell me if that sign ever reappeared at the death of anyone other than ‘Ali . My father said: O commander of the believers! On the night on which the Commander of the Believers was killed, no rock was moved (anywhere) on earth without fresh blood being seen under it until the break of dawn. The same thing happened on the night on which Hārūn , brother of Mūsā , was killed. The same thing happened on the night on which Yūsha’ ibn Nūn was killed. The same thing happened on the night on which ‘Isā ibn Maryam was raised to the sky. The same thing happened on the night on which Sham’ūn ibn Ḥammūn Al-Safā was killed. The same thing happened on the night on which ‘Ali ibn Abī Ťālib was killed. The same thing happened on the night on which Ḥusain ibn ‘Ali was killed. Imam Sādiq continued: Hishām’s face and colour changed out of anger (when he heard this) and he was about to attack my father . However, my father said, “O commander of the believers! It is obligatory for the slaves (of Allāh) to obey their Imam and to be truthful to him. That which led me to answer this question was my knowledge of the fact that I have to obey the commander of the believers. So may the commander of the believers judge me favourably!” Hishām said, “You may return to your family if you so choose.” So as my father was leaving, Hishām asked him to promise him not to narrate this Ḥadīth to anyone for as long as Hishām lived, to which my father agreed."

And all of the walls became red like blood. The skies rained fresh blood for three days and at night we heard a caller crying out the following poem: Does the nation that killed Ḥusain hope to receive the intercession of his grandfather on the Day of Judgment!? Verily Allāh forbids you to receive the intercession of Aḥmad ﷺ and Abī Turāb . You have killed the best of all those who ever rode (a sumpter). You have killed the best of everyone from among the youth to the elderly. There was a solar eclipse that lasted three days, after which the sky became filled with so many stars (that they were almost colliding with one another). On the next day, we were grief-stricken about the killing of Ḥusain . Shortly thereafter, we learned the disastrous news of the killing of Ḥusain ."

Muḥammad ibn ‘Abdillāh ibn Ja’far Al-Ḥimyari narrated to me from his father, from ‘Ali ibn Muḥammad ibn Sālim, from Muḥammad ibn Khālid, from ‘Abdillāh ibn Ḥammād Al-Basri, from ‘Abdillāh ibn ‘Abdil Raḥmān Al-Asam, from Abi Ya’qūb, from Abān ibn ‘Uthmān, from Zurārah, who said: Abū ‘Abdillāh (Imam Sādiq ) said: O Zurarah! The heavens cried for forty days with blood (weeping) over Ḥusain ; the earth cried for forty days by being covered with darkness; the sun cried for forty days by being in eclipse and by turning red; the mountains were torn apart and dispersed; the seas gushed out and the angels cried for forty days over him. (After Hussain was killed) all of our women stopped dying their hair, using kohl, applying oil, and styling their hair until the head of ‘Ubaydillāh ibn Ziyād was sent to us; and even after that we (all) continued to weep over him. Whenever my grandfather (Imam Sajjād ) would remember Ḥusain , he would cry so much that his tears would moisten his beard and everyone around him would start crying, sympathizing with his tears over Ḥusain . Verily the angels (who are posted) by the grave of Ḥusain cry over him (so much) that every angel in the sky and in the heavens cries because of their tears. When the soul of Ḥusain left (his body), Hell sighed in such an intense way that the earth almost split apart. When the souls of ‘Ubaydillā ibn Ziyād and Yazid ibn Mu’āwiyah – may Allāh’s curse be upon them – left their bodies, Hell whooped so intensely that if it was not for Allāh containing it, using its dedicated keepers, it would have burnt everyone on earth with its outburst. If permission was given to Hell, it would not have left anything without swallowing it. However, it is restrained by shackles and controlled by orders. Verily Hell became violent – beyond the control of its keepers – more than once, until Jabra`īl went to it and hit it with his wings, after which it was pacified. Verily Hell cries and laments over Hussain and its fire blazes on the killers of Ḥusain . If it was not for the Decisive Proofs of Allāh who are on earth, Hell would have destroyed the earth and overturned everything on it. However, the number of earthquakes will increase only when the Hour draws near. There are no eyes and (there is) not a tear loved more by Allāh than the eyes of those who cry and shed tears over Ḥusain . Verily anyone who cries over him connects with Fāťimah (s.a.), supports her (in her lamentation), connects with the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ, and fulfills our rights. On the Day of Judgment, everyone will be resurrected while crying except those who have cried over my grandfather – Ḥusain . Verily those who have cried over him will receive glad tidings when they are resurrected. They will be delighted and happiness will exude from their faces. They will feel safe while everyone else will be (extremely) frightened. (The bad deeds of) the people will be published while those who have cried on Ḥusain will be sitting with him under the shade of the Throne. They will be conversing with Ḥusain without any fear of the trials of the Day of Judgment. They will be told to enter Paradise but they will refuse, choosing to sit with Ḥusain and listen to him speak (instead). Then the houris (of Paradise) will send after them (from Paradise) and say, “Verily we and the ‘youths of never-ending bloom’ (56:17) are waiting for you.” However, they will not (even) turn their faces toward the houris because of the extent of the happiness and honour that they feel in their gathering with Ḥusain . Verily (on that day), some of their enemies will be pulled by their foreheads toward Hell while others will cry out, “Now we have no intercessors, nor any loving friend” (26:100-101). Verily the enemies will see their position (those who had cried on Ḥusain ) but they will not be able to reach them or (even) come near them. The angels will bring messages (from Paradise for those who have cried over Ḥusain ) sent by their spouses and their servants, informing them of the blessings that have been prepared for them (in Paradise). However, they will reply, “We shall come to you In-Shā`allāh.” The angels will inform their spouses of their response. When their spouses learn of the way in which they are being honoured and of their closeness to Ḥusain , they will yearn for them even more. They (those who have cried on Ḥusain ) will (continuously) say, “Praise be to Allāh who protected us from the great terror and the trials of the Day of Judgment and saved us from that which we feared.” Then some precious saddled conveyances will be brought for them which they will ride to their places (in Paradise) while praising and glorifying Allāh and sending blessings on Muḥammad and his family ."

Muḥammad ibn ‘Abdillāh (ibn Ja’far Al-Ḥimyari) narrated to me from his father, from ‘Ali ibn Muḥammad ibn Sālim, from Muḥammad ibn Khālid, from ‘Abdillāh ibn Ḥammād Al-Basri, from ‘Abdillāh ibn ‘Abdil Raḥmān Al-Asam, from ‘Abdillāh ibn Muskān, from Abī Basīr, who said: I was speaking with Abī ‘Abdillāh (Imam Sādiq ) when his son entered. The Imam welcomed him, and then hugged and kissed him. Then Imam said: May Allāh degrade those who degraded you (referring to the children of Imam Ḥusain ). May Allāh avenge those who oppressed you. May Allāh disappoint those who abandoned you. May Allāh curse those who killed you. May Allāh be your friend, protector, and supporter. Verily the prophets, the truthful ones, the martyrs, the angels of the heavens, and our women have been weeping for long. Then the Imam started to cry and said: O Abā Basīr! When I look at the children of Hussain , grief overcomes me when I remember what was done to them and to their father . O Abā Basīr! Verily Fāťimah (s.a.) cries and sobs over Ḥusain . (When Hell hears her voice) it sighs in such an intense way, that if the keepers of Hell – who also hear her voice – did not prepare themselves to restrain it, Hell would burn all of the inhabitants of the earth with its blazing fires and its sparking fumes. They (the keepers) contain and restrain it and hold its doors tightly closed for as long as Fāťimah (s.a.) cries. They do this because of their fear for the inhabitants of the earth. However, Hell is not pacified until the voice of Fāťimah subsides. Verily the seas almost split apart and then collide (when they hear the weeping of Fāťimah ). There is a dedicated angel responsible for every drop of water. When these angels hear the voice of Fāťimah , they prevent every drop of water from boiling with their wings; they keep the water together because of their fear for (this) world and everything in it, (specifically) the people of the earth. The angels remain in fear (for the people when they hear the voice of Fāťimah ) and cry for her crying. And then they pray to Allāh and beseech Him, after which the inhabitants of the Throne and those who are around it beseech Allāh. Then the voices of the angels are raised in glorification of Allāh, all because of their fear for the people of the earth. Even if one of their voices reached the earth, all of the inhabitants of the earth would swoon away, the mountains would crumble, and the earth would shake (under) its inhabitants. I (Abū Basīr) said, “May I sacrifice myself for you! This is such a great matter.” Imam replied, “That which you have not heard is even greater than this. O Abā Basīr! Do you not want to be among those who support Fāťimah (s.a.)?!” When I heard this, I cried so much that I could not speak any longer nor could the Imam speak because (of how intensely) he was crying. Then he (the Imam ) moved toward his prayer mat and started to supplicate to Allāh, and I left him in that state. I could not eat nor sleep that night. The next morning I was fasting and I was in extreme fear when I went to the Imam . When I saw that he had calmed down, I also calmed down and praised Allāh because no chastisement had befallen me."

Muḥammad ibn ‘Abdillāh ibn Ja’far Al-Ḥimyari narrated to me from his father, from ‘Ali ibn Muḥammad ibn Sālim, from Muḥammad ibn Khālid, from ‘Abdillāh ibn Ḥammād Al-Basri, from ‘Abdillāh ibn ‘Abdil Raḥmān Al-Asam, from Haytham ibn Wāqid, from (‘Abdil Malik ibn) Muqarrin, who said: Abū ‘Abdillāh (Imam Sādiq ) said: When you go to the Ziyārah of Abī ‘Abdillāh (Imam Ḥusain ), maintain silence except when (you are) saying that which is good. Verily the angels of the night and of the day from among the Keepers go to the angels who are in ḤĀ`IR and shake hands with them. However, the angels of Ḥā`ir do not speak to them because they are crying so intensely. Therefore, the angels (among the Keepers) wait for them until midday or until sunrise and then they speak to them and ask them about some of the affairs of the heavens. The angels of Ḥā`ir abstain from speaking between these times (sunrise and midday) and their crying and supplicating does not diminish. Verily the Keepers do not distract the angels of Ḥā`ir between these two times. However the angels of Ḥā`ir become distracted when you (those who go to the Ziyārah of Ḥusain ) speak. I asked, “May I sacrifice myself for you! What do the angels ask each other and which group asks the other? Is it the Keepers who ask (the angels of Ḥā`ir) or is it the angels of Ḥā`ir who ask (the Keepers)?” Imam replied, “The angels of Ḥā`ir ask the Keepers because the angels of Ḥā`ir do not move from their place. However, the Keepers descend from the heavens and ascend back to them.” I asked, “What do the angels of Ḥā`ir ask the Keepers?” Imam replied: The Keepers pass by Ismā’īl, the Angel of Air, in their ascent (to the heavens) and sometimes they reach him at the same time when the Prophet, Fāťimah, Ḥasan and Ḥusain, and the (other) Imams , who have passed away, are there (with Ismā’īl). They (the Ahlul Bayt ) ask the Keepers about some matters and about those of you (Zuwwār) who are present in Ḥā`ir. They (the Ahlul Bayt ) say to the Keepers, “Give them (those who have gone to the Ziyārah of Ḥusain ) glad tidings with your prayers.” The Keepers ask, “How should we give them glad tidings when they cannot hear us?” The Ahlul Bayt will reply, “Congratulate them and pray for them on our behalf. Verily these are our glad tidings to them. When they want to leave, surround them and rub your wings on them so that they can feel your presence. Verily we entrust them to He whose trust will never be lost.” Imam continued: If the Zuwwār of Ḥusain and the people knew the blessings of the Ziyārah of Ḥusain , they would have fought one another with swords and they would have sold their belongings to go to his Ziyārah. Verily when Fāťimah (s.a.) – who is accompanied by one thousand prophets, one thousand SIDDǏQ (truthful), one thousand martyrs, and one million from among the KARŪBIYYǏN who all support her by joining her in crying (over Ḥusain ) – looks at those who go to the Ziyārah of Ḥusain , she lets out a whoop in such a way that no angel remains in the heavens who does not cry, sympathizing with her cry. However, Fāťimah (s.a.) is not pacified until the Prophet ﷺ goes to her and says, “O my daughter! You have made the inhabitants of the heavens cry and you have distracted them from glorifying and sanctifying (Allāh). Therefore, stop crying so that they can glorify (Allāh). ‘Verily Allāh accomplishes His purpose’ (65:3).” Verily, Fāťimah (s.a.) looks at those of you who are present at the grave of Ḥusain and she asks Allāh to shower you with all of the blessings. Imam continued, “Do not abstain from the Ziyārah of Ḥusain . Verily the blessings of going to his Ziyārah are much greater than that which can be counted.”"

How short are your lives, O Ahlul Bayt! And how close are your deaths to one another while the entire creation needs you?!” Imam replied: There is a sheet for each one of us (the Imams ) which contains everything that we need to do during our time. Once every order on that sheet has been carried out, we know that our death is imminent. The Messenger of Allāh ﷺ comes to us and informs us that our death has come and he informs us of the rewards that Allāh has prepared for us. Verily Ḥusain read the sheet that was entrusted to him, and that which would happen and that which was yet to come were explained to him. There were a few things left on Ḥusain’s sheet which had not been fulfilled when he rose to fight. Those matters were that the angels asked Allāh for permission to help Ḥusain (in fighting) and Allāh granted it to them. While they were preparing themselves for battle, Ḥusain was killed. When the angels descended (to earth), they found that Ḥusain’s time had passed and he had been killed. Therefore, they said (to Allāh), “O Lord! You gave us permission to descend to earth to support Ḥusain but when we arrived, You had already taken him back (to Yourself)?!” Allāh – the Most Exalted – revealed to them, “Stay by his grave until (the day) when you see him rise (again) and then support him. Cry over him and over losing the opportunity to support him. Verily you have been chosen to support him and to cry over him.” The angels were grieved and they cried and mourned over losing the opportunity to support Ḥusain . However, when he rises, they will be (among) his supporters."

My father narrated to me from Sa’d ibn ‘Abdillāh, from Ya’qūb ibn Yazīd, from Ibrāhīm ibn ‘Uqbah, from Aḥmad ibn ‘Amr ibn Muslim, from Al-Maythami, who said: Five men from Kūfah wanted to go and support Ḥusain ibn ‘Ali . On their journey, they passed by a village called Shāhi where they met two men, one of whom was elderly and the other was a youth. They greeted the five men. The old man said, “I am a man from among the Jinn and this (referring to his young companion) is my nephew. We (also) want to support the oppressed man (Imam Ḥusain ) and I have an idea.” The five men asked him, “What is your idea?” He replied, “I will fly (quickly) and bring some information about the situation so that you can go to him informed.” The (five) men replied, “This is an excellent idea.” So he disappeared from their sight. After an entire day, they heard (his) voice reciting the following (poem) but they could not see him: I swear to Allāh that I did not come (back) until I saw him in Ťaf with his cheeks covered with dust and he had been slaughtered. He was surrounded by some men whose throats were gushing with blood; they were shining like lamps whose light had overcome darkness. I impelled my sumpter (to go faster) so that I could meet them before they (died and) met the virgin houris. Ḥusain was the light with which guidance was sought and Allāh is my witness that I am not forging a lie. (Now) he is pleased in rooms in the neighbourhood of the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ, Batūl (s.a.), and Ťayyār. (Upon hearing this), one of the five men replied to him by reciting the following poem: Go back and stay committed to the grave through which the rains of blessings are poured until the Day of Judgment. I (surely) follow the same path that you have and I drink from a cup which is filled (with blessings). And I follow the path of those who have freed themselves from everything for (the sake of) Allāh and have abandoned their dwellings, their wealth, and their loved ones."

(Carry me to Ḥusain ) whose grandfather is the most glorious grandfather and Ḥusain is the most magnanimous one. Verily Allāh has chosen him for the best of affairs. May he remain until the end of time! So Ḥusain replied by reciting the following poem: I shall go toward death and there is no shame for a man in death as long as his intentions are based on the truth and he fights (for Allāh) as a Muslim. (There is no shame in death for men) as long as they support the righteous ones, fight the criminals, and abandon the sinners. (I shall fight) and if I live, I shall not have any regrets. And if I am killed, I will not be blamed. Nothing is more humiliating than living under the humiliation of the oppressors.

Ḥusain (stood up) and started walking between them and said, “I ask you by Allāh not to disobey Allāh and His Messenger ﷺ by revealing this matter (publicly).” The women replied: Then who should we cry and mourn over if we do not mourn today, for today is like the day when the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ, ‘Ali, Fāťimah , Ruqayyah, Zaynab, and Um Kulthūm died. O the most loved one from among (our loved ones) who have passed away! We ask you by Allāh (to allow us) to be your ransom to keep death away from you. Then one of his aunts came forth crying and said: O Ḥusain! I testify that I heard the Jinn lament over you and recite the following poem: Verily the slain one from the family of Hāshim lowered the necks of the Quraysh and disgraced them. He was the love of the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ and he was not an immoderate person. (O Ḥusain!) Your tragedy is the great(est) tragedy and it has grieved everyone. Imam Bāqir added: The Jinn also recited the following poem: Weep over Ḥusain , the master, the one whose death turned the hairs white. You have been afflicted with earthquakes and the moon has eclipsed because of his killing. And the horizons turn red (everyday) at sunrise and sunset. And the sun has been covered with dust and the earths have been covered with darkness. He is the son of Fāťimah (s.a.) and the entire creation has been afflicted by his tragedy. (After the killing of Ḥusain ) we have lost our glory and we have inherited humiliation."

We have come here to ask you (about this).” Imam said: At the time of my grandfather, the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ, owls used to live in palaces, houses, and developed structures. When people used to eat, owls would fly and sit next to them and people would throw (their) food to them and give them water, after which they would return to their abodes. However, when Ḥusain was killed, the owls abandoned the developed structures for wreckages, mountains, and deserts and they said, “What an evil nation you are! You have killed the son of your Prophet’s daughter. We will never feel safe with you again.”"

Muḥammad ibn ‘Abdillāh ibin Ja’far Al-Ḥimyari narrated to me from his father, from ‘Ali ibn Muḥammad ibn Sālim, from Muḥammad ibn Khālid, from ‘Abdillāh ibn Ḥammād Al-Basri, from ‘Abdillāh ibn ‘Abdil Raḥmān Al-Asam, from Misma’ ibn ‘Abdil Malik Kirdīn Al-Basri, who said: Abū ‘Abdillāh (Imam Sādiq ) said to me, “O Misma’! You are from Iraq. Do you not go to the grave of Ḥusain ?” I replied: No. I am well-known among the people of Basra and we have some people there who are the followers of the Caliph. We (also) have lots of enemies from among the tribes, NUSSĀB, and others. I do not feel safe, for they might report me to the son of Sulaymān (the governor of Kūfah) and they will torture me to act as a deterrent for others. Imam asked, “Do you not remember what was done to him (Ḥusain )?” I replied, “Yes.” Imam asked, “Do you grieve impatiently (over Ḥusain’s tragedy)?” I replied, “Yes! I swear to Allāh (that I do)! I cry over (that which was done to him) so much that my family sees the effect (of my grief) over me. And I abstain from eating and its effects (also) appear on my face.” Imam said: May Allāh’s Mercy be upon your tears! Verily you are counted among those who grieve impatiently for us, those who are happy for our happiness and grieve over our grief, and those who are afraid when we are afraid, and feel safe when we feel safe. Verily when you die, my fathers will be there for you and they will be giving recommendations to the Angel of Death about you. Verily the glad tidings that they (my fathers ) will give you will be a greater reward than this. Verily the Angel of Death will be more kind and merciful to you than a compassionate mother is to her son. Then the Imam started to cry and I cried with him. Then he (the Imam ) said: Praise be to Allāh, who by (His) Mercy, gave preference to us and favoured us, the Ahlul Bayt, above (the rest of) His creation. O Misma’! Verily the earth and the heavens continuously cry for us, sympathizing with us since the day the Commander of the Believers was killed. And the number of angels who cry over us is even greater than this. The tears of the angels have never stopped since (the day) our killing began. Allāh will have mercy on whoever cries, sympathizing with that which was done to us, even before his tears fall from his eyes. (Verily) if one of the tears which runs on his cheeks were to fall over Hell, it would extinguish the (burning) heat of it in such a way that no heat would remain in it (at all). Verily those whose hearts ache for us will be pleased by seeing us at the time of their death in such a way that this pleasure will stay in their hearts until they meet us by the Pool (on the Day of Judgment). Verily (the Pool of) Kawthar will be delighted when one of our lovers comes to it and will serve him with various kinds of food to such an extent that he (the lover of the Ahlul Bayt ) will not ever wish to leave (the Pool). O Misma’! Those who drink (even) one sip from the Pool will never feel thirsty again and they will never ask for (another) drink again. It is as cold as camphor, as fragrant as musk, and as tasty as ginger. It is sweeter than honey, softer than butter, more pure than a tear, and more aromatic than ambergris. It emerges from Tasnīm and it passes through the rivers of Paradise and flows over a riverbed made of pearl and corundum. The number of jugs in it is greater than the number of stars in the sky; they are made of gold, silver, and various kinds of gems. Its fragrance (the Pool of Kawthar) can be smelled from a distance of one thousand years and such great fragrances emanate from it onto the face of whoever drinks from it, that he will say, “I wish if I could have been left right here. I do not need anything other than this and I do not wish to be moved from here.” O son of Kirdīn! Verily you will be among those whose thirst will be quenched by it, and everyone whose eyes cried on us will be blessed by looking at Kawthar and will be given a drink from it. Verily the desires of those who love us more will be satisfied in a greater way, and they will feel more pleasure, and they will find the water from the Pool of Kawthar more tasty than those who love us less. Verily the Commander of the Believers will be standing by the (Pool of) Kawthar and he will have a stick made of boxthorn in his hand with which he will smash our enemies (in such a way) that one of our enemies will say, “I testify that there is no god but Allāh and Muḥammad is the Messenger of Allāh!” The Commander of the Believers will reply, “Go to your leader, so-and-so, and ask him to intercede for you.” The man will say, “My leader, whom you mentioned, dissociates himself from me.” The Commander of the Believers will reply, “Go back and ask the one whom you used to love, follow, and whom you preferred above the rest of creation to intercede for you since he was the best of creation in your eyes, for verily (only) the best of creation can intercede.” The man will say, “I am dying of thirst!” The Commander of the Believers will reply, “May Allāh increase your thirst and your need for water!” I (Misma’) asked, “May I sacrifice myself for you! How can he (this enemy) even come close to the Pool when others cannot?” Imam replied: He stayed away from hideous acts and abstained from insulting us – the Ahlul Bayt – when we had been mentioned in his presence and he avoided some other (hideous) acts which others had dared to commit. However, none of this (abstaining from these evil deeds) was based on following us or loving us. Rather, it was based on his diligence in worship and in religious acts and based on being preoccupied with himself rather than talking about others. However, the heart (of such a person) is filled with hypocrisy and his religion is based on hating us, following those who incite hatred toward us, believing in the authority of those two people of the past, and giving preference to them over everyone else."

My father narrated to me from Ḥusain ibn Ḥasan ibn Abān, from Ḥusain ibn Sa’īd, from ‘Abdillāh ibn Mughīrah, from ‘Abdillāh ibn ‘Abdil Raḥmān Al-Asam, from ‘Abdillāh ibn Bukayr Al-Arjāni, who said: I accompanied Abā ‘Abdillāh (Imam Sādiq ) (from Madīnah to Makkah) on a Hajj trip and I asked him, “O son of the Messenger of Allāh! If the grave of Ḥusain ibn ‘Ali was to be disinterred, would anything be found in it?” Imam replied: O son of Bukayr! Your questions are (always) about great matters. Verily Ḥusain along with his father, mother, and his brother are with the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ in his house and they are being rewarded and sustained, (just) as the Prophet ﷺ is. Verily Ḥusain is hanging on to the right side of the Throne and he says, “O my Lord! Fulfill Your promise to me.” Verily Ḥusain looks at those who go to his Ziyārah and he knows them and he knows their names, the names of their fathers, and that which they carry along with them even better than they know their own sons. Verily he looks at those who cry over him and he seeks forgiveness for them and asks his father to seek forgiveness for them. And he says to them (those who cry over him), “O those who cry (over me)! If you knew about that which Allāh has prepared for you, you would be more happy than you are grieved (over me).” Imam continued, “Verily Ḥusain seeks forgiveness for them for every sin and for every mistake.” The above Ḥadīth has also been narrated to me through the following chain: My father, from Sa’d ibn ‘Abdillāh, from Muḥammad ibn Ḥusain, from Muḥammad ibn ‘Abdillāh ibn Zurārah, from ‘Abdillāh ibn ‘Abdil Raḥmān Al-Asam, from ‘Abdillāh ibn Bukayr, from Abī ‘Abdillāh ."

When I arrived near the grave, someone came toward me and said, “Go back! You have been rewarded! You will not be able to go to him now.” I left in fear. I waited until it was close to dawn and then I went back toward the grave. When I arrived near the grave, the same person came toward me again and said, “O man! You still cannot go to him.” So I said, “May Allāh keep you well! Why can I not go to him? I have come from Kūfah for his Ziyārah. Therefore, do not prevent me – may Allāh keep you well! I am afraid that the sun will rise and if the people of Shām find me here, they will kill me.” He replied: Wait for a while because Mūsā ibn ‘Imrān asked Allāh to give him permission to come to the Ziyārah of the grave of Ḥusain , and Allāh has granted him permission. Mūsā has descended from the heavens with seventy thousand angels and they have been here since the beginning of the night and they are waiting for dawn, after which they will ascend to the heavens. I asked, “May Allāh keep you well! Who are you?” He replied, “I am one of the angels who are ordered to protect the grave of Ḥusain and to seek forgiveness for those who come to his Ziyārah.” So I left, having almost lost my mind from hearing what I had heard. At dawn, I went back toward the grave. However, this time no one stopped me. I went to the grave and said Salām to Ḥusain , cursed his killers, prayed the Fajr Salāt, and returned quickly because of my fear of the people of Shām.

Do you also go to his Ziyārah?” Imam replied, “How can I not go to his Ziyārah when Allāh goes to his Ziyārah?! Every Thursday night, Allāh descends to him with the angels, the prophets, the successors, and with Muḥammad ﷺ – the best of the prophets, and with us – the best of the successors.” I asked, “May I sacrifice myself for you! Then should we also perform his Ziyārah on Thursday nights so that we can achieve (the status of) accompanying the Lord in performing his Ziyārah?” Imam replied, “Yes! O Safwān! Stay committed to it (performing the Ziyārah of Ḥusain every Thursday night) so that going to the Ziyārah of Ḥusain is registered for you. Verily this is such a privilege.

My father narrated to me from Sa’d ibn ‘Abdillāh, from some of his companions, from Aḥmad ibn Qutaybah Al-Hamdāni, from Isḥāq ibn ‘Ammār, who said: I said to Abī ‘Abdillāh (Imam Sādiq ): On the night of ‘Arafah, I was in Ḥā`ir praying. I saw close to fifty thousand handsome men who smelled beautiful and who were praying Salāt all night. It was after dawn that I prostrated and when I raised my head, I could not see any of them. Abū ‘Abdillāh said to me: Fifty thousand angels passed by Ḥusain while he was being killed so they ascended to the heavens. Allāh, the Exalted, revealed to them, “You passed by the son of My love and he was being killed but you did not help him. Descend to the earth and dwell near his grave while you are disheveled and covered with dust until the rising of the Hour.”"

Once the permission was granted to me, I entered and found him on his MUSALLĀ in his house (establishing prayers). I waited until he finished his prayers and then I heard him recite the following supplication: O Allāh! O One who has chosen us for honour, promised us the power of intercession, chosen us as the successors, given us the knowledge of that which has passed and that which remains, and made the hearts of some of the people yearn for us! (O Allāh) forgive me and my brothers – those who go to the Ziyārah of my father, Ḥusain , and those who spend their wealth to travel, seeking to please us and hoping for (the reward) which You have prepared for connecting with us. They go (to the Ziyārah of Ḥusain ) to make Your Prophet happy, to obey our commands, and to antagonize our enemies. By doing this, they want to please You. Therefore, reward them on our behalf by RIĎWĀN, protect them day and night, compensate their families and their children whom they left behind in the best way and befriend them, keep them away from the harm of every insolent tyrant and every weak or strong one from Your creation, keep them away from the evil of every devil from among the men and the Jinn, grant them the best of that which they have requested from You while they are away from their homes for having chosen us over their families, their children, and their relatives. O Allāh! Our enemies have criticized them for going (to our Ziyārah) but that did not stop them from coming to us and they went against those who are against us. So have mercy on those faces which have been changed by the sun. Have mercy on those cheeks which have rolled over the grave of Abī ‘Abdillāh Al-Ḥusain . Have mercy on those eyes which have shed tears on us with sympathy. Have mercy on those hearts which have become restless and anguished for us and have mercy on their screams for us. O Allāh! I entrust those bodies and souls to You until the day of the great thirst when You will quench their thirst with the Pool (of Kawthar). Mu’āwiyah ibn Wahab continued: Imam kept repeating this supplication in prostration. When he finished, I said, “May I sacrifice myself for you! I think that if this supplication applies to even the people who do not know Allāh, the Great and Almighty, the fire (of Hell) will never touch them!!! I swear to Allāh that (now) I wish I had gone to his Ziyārah instead of going to Hajj.” Imam said, “You live so close to him. What prevents you from going to his Ziyārah? O Mu’āwiyah! Why do you neglect it?” I replied, “May I sacrifice myself for you! I did not think that it was this important.” Imam said, “O Mu’āwiyah! The number of those in the heavens who pray for those who go to the Ziyārah of Ḥusain is greater than those who pray for them on earth.” The above Ḥadīth has also been narrated to me through the following chains: A) Muḥammad ibn ‘Abdillāh ibn Ja’far Al-Ḥimyari, from his father, from ‘Ali ibn Muḥammad ibn Sālim, from ‘Abdillāh ibn Ḥammād Al-Basri, from ‘Abdillāh ibn ‘Abdil Raḥmān Al-Asam, from Mu’āwiyah ibn Wahab, from Abī ‘Abdillāh .

He will be riding a pitch-black horse which has a raceme on its forehead. He will jump (with) the horse in such a way that people in every country will see him as if he is with them in their (own) country. Then he will unfold the flag of the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ. The flag-pole is from the pillars of the Throne while the rest (of the flag) is from Allāh’s victory! If he points this flag to anything, Allāh will destroy it. When he shakes the flag, the heart of every believer will become like a strong piece of iron and each believer will be given the strength of forty men. Every believer who has died will feel the happiness (of the rising of the Qā`im ) in his grave. They (the dead believers) will start visiting one another in their graves and will give glad tidings to one another about the rising of the Qā`im . Then thirteen thousand three hundred and thirteen angels will join the Qā`im . I (Abān ibn Taghlib) asked, “This many angels will join him?” Imam replied: Yes. (These are) the angels who were with Nūḥ in the ark, with Ibrāhīm when he was cast in the fire, with Mūsā when he split the sea for the Banī Israel, and who were with ‘Isā when Allāh ascended him to Himself. (Among these angels are also) the four thousand “(fully equipped) distinguished angels” and the one thousand “angels [who came] in an unbroken succession” who were with the Prophet ﷺ, the three hundred and thirteen angels who fought in the Battle of Badr, and the four thousand angels who descended to fight along with Ḥusain but who were not permitted to (fight). They (these four thousand angels) remain by the grave of Ḥusain , disheveled and covered with dust. They cry over him (and will continue to do so) until the Day of Judgment. Their chief is an angel named Mansūr. These angels receive everyone who comes to the Ziyārah of Ḥusain and they accompany them when they bid farewell to Ḥusain .

Muḥammad ibn ‘Abdillāh ibn Ja’far Al-Ḥimyari narrated to from his father, from ‘Ali ibn Muḥammad ibn Sālim, from Muḥammad ibn Khālid, from ‘Abdillāh ibn Ḥammād Al-Basri, from (‘Abdillāh ibn ‘Abdil Raḥmān) Al-Asam, from Hishām ibn Sālim, who said: A man came to Abī ‘Abdillāh (Imam Sādiq ) and asked, “O son of the Messenger of Allāh! Should one go to the Ziyārah of your father (Ḥusain )?” Imam replied, “Yes and establish prayers next to his grave. But one should not establish prayers in front of the grave, but rather, one should stand behind it when establishing prayers.” The man asked, “What is the reward for those who go to his Ziyārah?” Imam replied, “Paradise, (but only) if they believe in his Imamate.” The man asked, “What about those who neglect his Ziyārah intentionally?” Imam replied, “(They will) regret (it) on the Day of Regret.” The man asked, “What about those who stay (a few days) by his grave?” Imam replied, “Every day will be equal to one thousand months (of worship).” The man asked, “What about those who spend money while traveling to his Ziyārah and who give charity near his grave?” Imam replied, “Every Dirham is equal to one thousand Dirhams.” The man asked, “What about those who die on their way to him?” Imam replied: The angels will bring embalmment and shrouds for them from Paradise and accompany them in their funerals. After they are shrouded (by the people), the angels will establish prayers on them and shroud them (again with another shroud) over their (existing) shrouds. Then they will spread flowers under their bodies (in their graves) and will push the walls of their graves three miles from every direction. Then a door from the doors of Paradise will be opened to their graves and its soothing fragrance will fill their graves until the rising of the Hour. The man asked, “What about those who establish prayers next to him?” Imam replied, “Those who establish two Rak’ah of prayers next to him will not ask anything from Allāh, the Exalted, without Allāh granting it.” The man asked, “What about those who perform Ghusl with the water of the Euphrates (River) and then go to him?” Imam replied, “If they perform Ghusl with the water of the Euphrates (River) with the intention of going to him, their sins will fall off of them (and they will become sinless) like the day their mothers gave birth to them.” The man asked, “What about those who make arrangements for others to go but they do not go themselves because of fear of affliction?” Imam replied, “Allāh will recompense them for every Dirham that they have spent (making the arrangement for others) with rewards as great as the mountain of Uḥud and will sustain them with multiple amounts. Furthermore, the afflictions which had been destined for them will be pushed away and their wealth will be protected.” The man asked, “What about those who are killed next to Ḥusain – those who are captured by a dominating power and killed?” Imam replied: All of their sins will be forgiven with the first drop of their blood which is spilled. Then the angels will cleanse the clay from which they were created. The impurities which were mixed with their clay – (originally) from the material used in the clay of the disbelievers – will be removed from their clay until it becomes as pure as the clay of the devoted prophets. Then their heart will be cleansed and their chest will be expanded and filled with faith. Therefore, they will meet Allāh while they are pure from every impurity which might be mixed with the heart or the body. They will be granted the power of intercession for their family members and for one thousand of their brothers (in faith). Jabra`īl and the Angel of Death, along with (the rest of) the angels, will undertake establishing the prayers on them. Furthermore, their shroud and embalmment will be brought for them from Paradise. Their graves will also be expanded. Lamps will be placed in them and a door will be opened from Paradise to their graves, after which the angels will bring exquisite gifts from Paradise to them. Eighteen days later, they will be moved to the Sacred Sanctuary and they will stay there in the company of Allāh’s Divine Authorities until the trumpet, which will leave nothing alive, is sounded. When the trumpet is sounded for the second time and they are resurrected from their graves, the first among those who will shake hands with them will be the Messenger of Allāh, the Commander of the Believers, and the successors . They will give glad tidings to them and tell them to hold on to them and to follow them to the Pool where they will be allowed to drink and give water to whomever they wish. The man asked, “What about those who are imprisoned during the Ziyārah?” Imam replied: They will receive one kind of pleasure for every day they were grieved and imprisoned until the Day of Judgment. And if they were also beaten while they were imprisoned in their Ziyārah, they will be rewarded with one houri for every time they were beaten. Every time they feel pain in their bodies, one million good deeds will be added to their deeds and one million bad deeds will be removed from their deeds and one million ranks will be added to their status. (On the Day of Judgment), they will be speaking with the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ while (others are) going through the judgment process. The carriers of the Throne will shake hands with them and they will be told to ask (Allāh) for whatever they wish. Those who had beaten them when they were imprisoned will be brought forth for judgment. However, they will not be questioned about anything. Rather, they will be held by their two upper arms and taken to an angel who will give them a drink from Ḥamīm and a drink from Ghislīn, after which they will be placed over frying pans in Hell and told, “Taste that which your hands brought forth by beating this man who was the guest of Allāh and the guest of His Messenger ﷺ.” And then those who were beaten will be brought to the door of Hell and will be told, “Look at those who beat you and look at what is happening to them. Are you satisfied with how you are avenged?” So those who were beaten will say, “Praise be to Allāh who achieved victory for us and for the son of His Messenger ﷺ.”"

Verily Allāh has chosen six places on earth: Bayt Al-Ḥarām (Ka’bah), Ḥaram (Masjid Al-Ḥarām), the graves of the prophets, the graves of the successors, the places of the martyrdom of the Martyrs, and the mosques in which the name of Allāh is remembered. O son of Bukayr! Do you know the reward for those who go to the Ziyārah of the grave of Abī ‘Abdillāh, Al-Ḥusain , although the ignorant neglect it?! Every morning, an angel calls out next to the grave of Ḥusain, “O those who seek blessings! Come to Allāh’s chosen one (Ḥusain ) so that you may return with honour and are protected from regret!” This call is heard by all of the inhabitants of the east and the west, except by mankind and Jinn. (Upon hearing this call), all of the angels on earth go to the Zuwwār of Ḥusain while they are asleep, sanctify Allāh close to them, and ask Allāh to be pleased with them (the Zuwwār). All of the angels in the air, who hear this call, respond to it by glorifying Allāh, the Exalted. The voices of the angels are raised and the inhabitants of the first sky respond to their voices (by glorifying Allāh). The voices of the angels and the inhabitants of the first sky are loud enough for the inhabitants of the seventh sky and for the prophets to hear, who then (in turn ask Allāh to) send mercy and blessings on Ḥusain and pray for those who go to his Ziyārah."

However, when I go, I am afraid; I dread the rulers, their governors, and their armed men until I return.” Imam said: O son of Bukayr! Do you not want Allāh to see you in fear for us?! Do you not know that Allāh will shelter those who are in fear because of our fear under the shade of His Throne, and that Ḥusain will be speaking to them under the Throne?! (Do you not know) that Allāh will keep them safe from the terrors of the Day of Judgment?! They will not be afraid while others will be terrified. And if they do get scared, the angels will pacify them and soothe their hearts by giving them glad tidings."

You should (also) abstain from that which is forbidden, from fighting, from taking oaths, and from quarrelling which leads to taking oaths. Verily if you follow that (which I mentioned), your Hajj and ‘Umrah will be complete.

Impossible! (But) I swear to Allāh that they are attached to the believers and they touch their faces with their hands. Every morning and every night, Allāh sends down food for the Zuwwār of Ḥusain from Paradise and the angels are their servants.

Should I tell you more?” I replied, “Yes, O my master.” Imam said: It is as if I can see a throne made of light which has been established. A dome made of a red ruby and decorated with gems has been placed on it and there are ninety thousand green domes surrounding it. And it is as if I can see Ḥusain sitting on this throne and the believers are going to his Ziyārah and saying Salām to him. Therefore, Allāh, the Great and Almighty, will say to them, “O My friends! Ask Me (anything) because you have been hurt, humiliated, and oppressed for a long time. However, today is the day that you will not ask Me for anything related to this life or the Hereafter without it being granted.” Imam added: Their food and drinks are in Paradise, and I swear to Allāh that this is the honour which will never end and its greatness cannot be perceived."

My father narrated to me from Sa’d ibn ‘Abdillāh, from Muḥammad ibn Ḥusain ibn Abil Khaťťāb, from some of his companions, from Juwayriyah ibn ‘Alā, from some of his companions, who said: Abū ‘Abdillāh (Imam Sādiq ) said: On the Day of Judgment, a caller will call out, “Where are the Zuwwār of Ḥusain ibn ‘Ali ?” So a large number of people, who cannot be counted by anyone other than Allāh, the Exalted, will stand. Then Allāh will ask them, “What made you go to the Ziyārah of the grave of Ḥusain ?” They will reply, “O Lord! We went to him because of our love for the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ and because of our love for ‘Ali and Fāťimah and to sympathize with him because of that which was committed against him.” They will be told, “Here are Muḥammad, ‘Ali, Fāťimah, Ḥasan, and Ḥusain . Join them, for you will be with them at their level (in Paradise). Follow the flag of the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ.” Therefore, they will go to the flag of the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ which will be held by ‘Ali and they will remain under its shade, in front of it, to its right, to its left, and behind it until all of them enter Paradise. The above Ḥadīth has also been narrated to me through the following chain: Muḥammad ibn Ja’far Al-Razzāz, from Muḥammad ibn Ḥusain ibn Abil Khaťťāb, from some of his companions, from Juwayriyah ibn ‘Alā, from some of his companions, from Abī ‘Abdillāh ."

If he dies in that year, the angels of mercy will attend (the rituals of) his ablution and shrouding and they will seek forgiveness for him. They will also follow him in his funeral while seeking forgiveness for him. His grave will be widened as far as he can see and Allāh will keep him safe from the pressure of the grave and from being frightened by (angels) Munkar and Nakīr. A door will also be opened from his grave to Paradise. On the Day of Judgment, his book (of deeds) will be placed in his right hand and he will shine with a light which illuminates everywhere from the east to the west.

Verily, He says to them: Do you not see the Zuwwār of the grave of Ḥusain who have come to him yearning for him and for Fāťimah, the daughter of the Messenger of Allāh?! I swear to My Glory, My Magnificence, and to My Greatness that I will ordain that they be honoured. I will take them to My Paradise, the Paradise which I have prepared for My friends, prophets, and messengers. O My angels! These are the Zuwwār of Ḥusain – the love of Muḥammad, My Messenger, and Muḥammad is My love. Those who love Me, love the one whom I love, and those who love the one whom I love, love the one loved by him (referring to Imam Ḥusain ). Those who hate My love, hate Me. It is My right to torment those who hate Me with My most intense of chastisements, to burn them with the blazing flames of My fire, and to make Hell their abode and their final destination where I will torment them with such an intense chastisement with which I will not torment anyone else."

The structure of Kāmil al-Ziyārāt is reader-friendly, beginning with an exploration of Ziyārāt and its various purposes and benefits. It then delves into the Ziyārāt of specific holy personalities and related themes. The book details the rewards associated with visitations, the proper rituals to perform, the designated recitations, and much more, as prescribed by the Ahl al-Bayt (as). The majority of this expansive 680-page work concentrates on the Ziyāra of Imam Husayn (as). Kāmil al-Ziyārāt is not merely a practical guide to take on a Ziyārāt trip. Instead, it transcends being a logistical guidebook to offer spiritual enrichment, insightful historical context, and a profound understanding of the purpose and merits of these sacred journeys. Whether one is planning a Ziyārā, yearning for one, or simply interested in comprehending its essence, this book offers meaningful and engaging content. Renowned in the world of Shia for being a trusted reference for Ḥadīths and supplications, Kāmil al-Ziyārāt is an essential reading for those eager to gain an in-depth understanding of Ziyāra and the rich traditions that envelop it.

Verily seventy thousand (different) angels who are disheveled and covered with dust descend to him (his grave) at the time of each prayer, and they will not have another opportunity (to return to his grave) until the Day of Judgment."

And I swear to Allāh that I did not leave the Imam until a man came to him and said, “I have gone to Hajj nineteen times. Please pray for me so that Allāh sustains me with the twentieth time.” Imam asked, “Have you ever gone to the Ziyārah of the grave of Ḥusain ?” The man replied, “No.” Imam said, “Verily going to his Ziyārah is better than twenty Hajj.”"

Abul ‘Abbās Al-Kūfi narrated to me from Muḥammad ibn Ḥusain, from Muḥammad ibn Ismā’īl, from Al-Khaybari, from Mūsā ibn Qāsim Al-Ḥaďrami, who said: Abū ‘Abdillāh (Imam Sādiq ) came (to Iraq) during the early days of the reign of Abī Ja’far (Mansūr Al-Dawānīqi). When he stopped in Najaf, he said to me: O Mūsā! Go and stand on the main route and wait until you see a man from the direction of Qādisiyyah. When he comes close to you, say, “There is a man from the children of the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ waiting here and he has asked you to join him.” And he will follow you. It was a very hot day and I went and stood on the route (that the Imam had told me about). I kept waiting, and I was about to disobey the Imam and leave when I saw something approaching from far that looked like a man riding a camel. I kept looking until he came close to me. I said to him, “There is man from the children of the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ waiting here and he described you to me. He has asked that you join him.” The man asked me to take him to the Imam . Once we arrived (at the tents), he tied his camel (to something) close to the tents. The Imam called the man inside and he obeyed (the order of Imam ). I went and stood at the door of the tent where I could hear them (speaking) but I could not see them. Abū ‘Abdillāh asked him, “Where are you coming from?” The man replied, “From the furthest part of Yemen.” Imam asked, “Are you not from such and such place?” (Imam mentioned the name.) The man replied, “Yes, I am.” Imam asked, “What brings you here?” The man replied, “I have come to the Ziyārah of Ḥusain .” Imam asked, “Have you come solely for the Ziyārah without any requests?” The man replied, “I have come with no requests and I only wish to pray next to him, perform his Ziyārah, say Salām to him, and then return to my family.” Imam asked, “What do you believe are the merits of his Ziyārah?” The man replied, “We believe that we receive blessings for ourselves, for our families, for our children, and in our wealth and sustenance. We also believe that our requests are fulfilled through his Ziyārah.” Imam asked, “O brother from Yemen! Should I not tell you about the additional merits of his Ziyārah?” The man said, “Tell me more, O son of the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ.” Imam said, “Verily the Ziyārah of Ḥusain is equal to an accepted and flawless Hajj with the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ.” The man was shocked to hear this so the Imam added, “Yes! I swear to Allāh. It is equal to two purified, accepted, and flawless Hajj with the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ.” The man was (even) more shocked and the Imam kept increasing the number until he mentioned thirty purified, accepted, and flawless Hajj with the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ."

Imam asked me, “Where are they going?” I replied, “To the graves of the martyrs (of Uḥud).” Imam asked, “What prevents them from going to the Ziyārah of the lonely (abandoned) Martyr?” One of the people who was from Iraq asked, “Is going to his Ziyārah obligatory?” Imam replied, “His Ziyārah is better than performing Hajj and ‘Umrah, and another Hajj and ‘Umrah, and another Hajj and ‘Umrah, and…” Yazīd ibn ‘Abdil Malik added: Imam mentioned twenty purified and accepted Hajj and ‘Umrah. And I swear to Allāh that I did not leave until a man came to the Imam and said, “I have gone to Hajj nineteen times.

Go to the grave of the son of the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ, the most blessed of the blessed ones, the most purified of the purified ones, and the most pious of the pious ones; for if you go to his Ziyārah, Allāh will register the reward of freeing twenty-five slaves for you.

The impurities which were mixed with their clay – (originally) from the filthy materials used in the clay of the disbelievers and the wicked ones – will be removed from their clay until it becomes as pure as the clay of the devoted prophets. Then their heart will be cleansed, expanded, and filled with faith. Therefore, they will meet Allāh while they are pure from every impurity which might be mixed with the heart or the body. They will be granted the power of intercession for their family members and one thousand of their brothers (in faith). Jabra`īl and the Angel of Death, along with (the rest of) the angels, will undertake establishing the prayers on them. Furthermore, their shroud and embalmment will be brought for them from Paradise. Their graves will be expanded, some lamps will be placed in them, and a door will be opened from Paradise to their graves. Then the angels will bring exquisite gifts from Paradise to them. Eighteen days later, they will be moved to the Sacred Sanctuary and they will stay there in the company of Allāh’s Divine Authorities until the trumpet, which will leave nothing alive, is sounded. When the trumpet is sounded for the second time and they are resurrected from their graves, the first among those who will shake hands with them will be the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ, the Commander of the Believers , and the successors . They will give glad tidings to them and tell them to hold on to them and to follow them to the Pool where they will be allowed to drink and give water to whomever they wish."

Verily there are four thousand angels next to his grave (who have been there) since the day his life was taken. They are disheveled, covered with dust, and they cry over him (and will continue to do so) until the Day of Judgment. These angels accompany those who go to the Ziyārah of Ḥusain back to their safe haven. If they become ill, the angels will visit them. And when they die, the angels will follow their corpses in their funerals."

Verily Allāh will register twenty purified and accepted Hajj, twenty purified and accepted ‘Umrah, and the reward of (fighting in) twenty battles with one of Allāh’s messengers or with a Just Imam for any believer who goes to (the Ziyārah of) the grave of Ḥusain knowing his rights on any day other than an Eid. Allāh will register one hundred Hajj and ‘Umrah and the reward of (fighting in) one hundred battles with one of Allāh’s messengers or with a Just Imam for anyone who goes to him (Imam Ḥusain ) on any Eid day. Allāh will register one thousand accepted Hajj and ‘Umrah and the reward of (fighting in) one thousand battles with one of Allāh’s messengers or with a Just Imam for anyone who goes to him (Imam Ḥusain ) on the Day of ‘Arafah knowing his rights. I said, “But how can I be anywhere better than ‘Arafāt on the day of ‘Arafah?” Imam looked at me angrily and said, “O Bashīr! When a believer goes to the Ziyārah of the grave of Ḥusain on the Day of ‘Arafah after performing Ghusl with the water of the Euphrates (River), Allāh will register one (complete) Hajj with all of its rituals for him with every step that he takes.” Bashīr added, “I believe that the Imam also mentioned (that Allāh will register the reward of participating in) a battle.”"

He turned his face toward me and asked, “O Bashīr! Did you go for Hajj last year?” I replied, “May I sacrifice myself for you! No, but instead I spent the Day of ‘Arafah next to the grave – referring to the grave of Ḥusain .” Imam said, “O Bashīr! I swear to Allāh that you did not miss anything (from the blessings) that were in Makkah for those who were there.” I said, “May I sacrifice myself for you! Explain this to me, for (the blessing of being in) ‘Arafāt is (only available) in Makkah.” Imam replied: O Bashīr! Verily every time one of you raises his foot or places it down walking toward the grave of Ḥusain while knowing his rights, after performing Ghusl on the shores of the Euphrates (River), Allāh will give you (the reward of) one hundred accepted Hajj and one hundred purified ‘Umrah and (the reward of) fighting in a hundred battles with one of Allāh’s messengers against His enemies and the enemies of His Messenger. O Bashīr! Listen (carefully) and inform (only) those whose hearts can handle this, “Those who go to the Ziyārah of Ḥusain on the Day of ‘Arafah are like those who go to the Ziyārah of Allāh on His Throne.”"

Ḥukaym ibn Dāwūd ibn Ḥukaym and others narrated to me from Muḥammad ibn Mūsā Al-Hamdāni, from Muḥammad ibn Khālid Al-Ťayālisi, from Sayf ibn ‘Amīrah, and from Sāliḥ ibn ‘Uqbah, from ‘Alqamah ibn Muḥammad Al-Ḥaďrami, who said: Abū Ja’far (Imam Bāqir ) said: Those who go to the Ziyārah of Ḥusain on the tenth day of Muḥarram (‘Āshūrā) and spend the night next to him, crying over him, will meet Allāh, the Exalted, with the reward of two million Hajj and two million ‘Umrah and the reward of fighting two million battles (in the way of Allāh). Moreover, the reward for each one of these Hajj, ‘Umrah, and battles will be equivalent to the reward of those who have gone to Hajj and ‘Umrah and have fought with the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ and the Righteous Imams – may Allāh’s blessings be upon all of them. I asked, “May I sacrifice myself for you! What about those who are in distant lands and far countries and cannot travel to him on that day?” Imam replied: On the Day of ‘Āshūrā, in the middle of the day and before noon, they should go to a desert or to an elevated part of their house and direct their Salām to Ḥusain by pointing toward him, curse his killers increasingly, and establish two Rak’ah of prayers. Then they should mourn and cry over Ḥusain , order everyone in their house to cry over him, hold (a gathering) in their house (in which) Ḥusain’s tragedies (are mentioned) and become restless over (the tragedies of) Ḥusain , and meet one another in their houses while crying and consoling one another over the tragedy of Ḥusain . Verily if they do this, I guarantee that Allāh, the Great and Almighty, will register all of those rewards (mentioned for going to his Ziyārah on the Day of ‘Āshūrā) for them. I asked, “May I sacrifice myself for you! Will you guarantee and promise these rewards for those who do this?” Imam replied, “I guarantee and promise these rewards for those who do this.” I asked, “How should they console one another?” Imam replied: They should say: . May Allāh increase our rewards for being grieved over the tragedy of Ḥusain and may He make us and you among those who seek to avenge him with his heir, the Rightly Guided Imam, from the family of Muḥammad . Imam added: If possible, do not attempt to fulfill your needs on this day, for verily it is an ominous day when needs are not fulfilled. And even if they are fulfilled, one will not be blessed with them nor will he find any success in them. Do not buy or take anything to your house on this day. Verily those who do will not find any blessings in that which they take to their houses nor will they be blessed with their families. Allāh will register the reward of one million Hajj, one million ‘Umrah, and one million battles (in the way of Allāh) for those who follow these (instructions), and all of this will be registered as if it was done with the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ. They will also earn the reward of (being afflicted by) the tragedies of all of the prophets, messengers, truthful ones, and the martyrs who died (naturally) or were killed since the day Allāh created this world until the rising of the Hour. Sāliḥ ibn ‘Uqbah Al-Juhani and Sayf ibn ‘Amīrah narrated that ‘Alqamah ibn Muḥammad Al-Ḥaďrami, added: I said to Abī Ja’far (Imam Bāqir ), “Teach me an invocation that I can recite on that day if I perform his Ziyārah from near (his grave) and an invocation that I can recite if I cannot perform his Ziyārah from near (his grave) and have to direct my Salām to him by pointing toward him from distant lands on the roof of my house.” Imam said: O ‘Alqamah! If you establish two Rak’ah of prayers after directing your Salām to him by pointing toward him and then recite the following invocation while directing your Salām to him, then you have invoked Allāh with that with which the angels invoke Him when they perform the Ziyārah of Ḥusain and Allāh will register one million good deeds for you, erase one million bad deeds for you, and add one hundred million ranks to your rank. You will be considered among those who were martyred with Ḥusain ibn ‘Ali and you will share their ranks. You will not be known for anything except being among the martyrs who were martyred with him and the reward of every prophet, every messenger, and every person who has gone to the Ziyārah of Ḥusain ibn ‘Ali since the day he was killed will be registered for you. (You should recite the following): Salām to you, O Abā ‘Abdillāh. Salām to you, O son of the Messenger of Allāh. Salām to you, O Choice of Allāh and the son of His Choice. Salām to you, O son of the Commander of the Believers and the son of the Master of the Successors. Salām to you, O son of Fāťimah, the Master of the Women of the Worlds. Salām to you, O one whose avenger is Allāh and O son of the one whose avenger is Allāh. Salām to you, O one who has not been avenged yet and who has yet to seek vengeance (against those who killed his family members). Salām to you and to the souls who dismounted at your vicinity and stayed in your caravan. I pray that Allāh’s Salām be upon all of you for as long as I live and for as long as there is a night and a day. O Abā ‘Abdillāh! The calamity is very painful and your tragedy is a great disaster for us and for all of the inhabitants of the heavens and the earth. May Allāh’s curse be upon the party who laid the foundation of oppression and injustice against you, the Ahlul Bayt. May Allāh’s curse be upon the party who kept you away from your positions and dethroned you from the posts in which Allāh had placed you. May Allāh’s curse be upon the party who killed you and may Allāh’s curse be upon those who made the arrangements for them to be able to fight against you. I seek nearness to Allāh and to you by dissociating myself from them, from their followers, and from those who obey them. O Abā ‘Abdillāh! Verily I make peace with those who are at peace with you and I am at war against those who are at war against you until the Day of Judgment. May Allāh’s curse be upon the family of Ziyād and upon the family of Marwān, and may Allāh’s curse be upon all of the Banī Umayyah. May Allāh’s curse be upon the son of Marjānah. May Allāh’s curse be upon ‘Umar ibn Sa’d. May Allāh’s curse be upon Shimr. And may Allāh’s curse be upon the party that bridled and saddled (their sumpters) in preparation to fight you. ﷺ O Abā ‘Abdillāh! May I sacrifice my father and mother for you. Being afflicted by your tragedy is extremely painful for me. Therefore, I ask Allāh, who has honoured your status, to honour me through you by sustaining me to seek your revenge along with the supported Imam from the family of Muḥammad ﷺ. O Allāh! Dignify me in Your eyes through Ḥusain in this life and in the Hereafter. O my master, O Abā ‘Abdillāh! I seek nearness to Allāh, the Exalted, to His Messenger, to the Commander of the Believers, to Fāťimah, to Ḥasan, and to you – may Allāh’s blessing and Salām be upon you and upon them – by loving you, O Abā ‘Abdillāh, and by dissociating from your enemies, from those who fought you and incited war against you, and from all of your enemies; and by dissociating from those who laid the foundation of injustice and built the structure of oppression and injustice against you and against your Shia. I seek nearness to Allāh and to you by dissociating myself from them. And I seek nearness to Allāh and then to you by loving you and loving your followers, by dissociating from your enemies and from those who incite war against you, and by dissociating from their followers and those who obey them. Verily I make peace with those who are at peace with you, I am at war against those who are at war against you, I befriend those who befriend you, and I antagonize those who antagonize you. I ask Allāh, who honoured me with knowing you and knowing your friends and sustained me with dissociation from your enemies, to allow me to be with you in this life and in the Hereafter and to keep my foot steady on the path of truth with you in this life and in the Hereafter. And I ask Him to allow me to come to the Praised Status that you have with Allāh. And I ask Allāh to sustain me with seeking your revenge along with the Rightly Guided Imam who will speak for you. I ask Allāh, through you and through your rank with Him, to recompense me for being afflicted by your tragedy with the best reward that He has ever given to anyone who has ever been afflicted by a tragedy. : « » I say, “Verily we are Allāh’s and verily to Him we shall return” (2:156).

Make me live the way Muḥammad and the family of Muḥammad ﷺ lived and (make me) die the way Muḥammad and the family of Muḥammad ﷺ died. ﷺ ﷺ O Allāh! This is the day that the curse descended upon the family of Ziyād, the family of Umayyah, and the son of the Eater of the Livers – the cursed one and the son of the cursed one – who were (both) cursed by the tongue of Your Prophet ﷺ in every land and in every place where Your Prophet ﷺ stopped. O Allāh! Curse Abā Sufyān and Mu’āwiyah. Curse be upon Yazīd, son of Mu’āwiyah, for all eternity. O Allāh! Multiply the curses on them for killing Ḥusain . . O Allāh! I seek nearness to You on this day and in this very place, and everyday of my life by dissociating myself from them, by cursing them, and by adhering to Your Prophet Muḥammad and the family of Your Prophet – may Allāh’s blessing be upon him and upon all of them. Then say one hundred times: ﷺ . O Allāh! Curse the first oppressor who usurped the rights of Muḥammad and the family of Muḥammad ﷺ, and curse every last person who followed him in that regard. O Allāh! Curse the party who fought against Ḥusain and paid allegiance to his enemies and followed them in killing Ḥusain and killing his supporters. O Allāh! Curse them all. Then say one hundred times: . Salām to you, O Abā ‘Abdillāh and to the souls who dismounted at your vicinity and stayed in your caravan. I pray that Allāh’s Salām be upon you for as long as I live and for as long as there is a night and a day. May Allāh not make this the last time I perform your Ziyārah. Salām upon Ḥusain, upon ‘Ali ibn Ḥusain, upon the children of Ḥusain, and upon the companions of Ḥusain – may Allāh’s blessings be upon all of them. Then say one time: . O Allāh! (I ask that) You specifically curse the first oppressor who oppressed the family of Your Prophet, and then curse the enemies of the family of Muḥammad from the first to the last. O Allāh! Curse Yazīď and his father, curse ‘Ubaydallāh ibn Ziyād, and curse the family of Marwān and all of the Banī Umayyah until the Day of Judgment. Then go in to prostration and say: . O Allāh! Praise be to You, the praise of those who are thankful in their tragedies. Praise be to Allāh for the greatness of my grief over their (the Ahlul Bayt ) disaster and calamity. O Allāh! Sustain me with the intercession of Ḥusain on the Day of Entering (the desert of Judgment) and keep my foot steady on the path of truth with Ḥusain and the companions of Ḥusain, who offered the blood of their hearts for the sake of Ḥusain – may Allāh’s blessings be upon all of them. ‘Alqamah added: Abū Ja’far (Imam Bāqir ) said, “O ‘Alqamah! If you can perform his Ziyārah by reading this Ziyārah every day of your life, do so, for Allāh-Willing you will have all of the rewards (which I mentioned).” The above Ḥadīth has also been narrated to me through the following chain: Muḥammad ibn Ismā’īl, from Sāliḥ ibn ‘Uqbah, from Mālik Al-Juhani, from Abī Ja’far ."

These angels will testify to the loyalty of those who go to the Ziyārah of Ḥusain , will accompany them back to their families, visit them if they become ill, and establish prayers on them when they die."

If their hearts accept loving us, then they are believers. And those who love us, should surely desire (going to) the Ziyārah of the grave of Ḥusain . Those who repeatedly go to the Ziyārah of Ḥusain are recognized by us as the lovers of us, the Ahlul Bayt , and they will be among the inhabitants of Paradise, whereas the faith of those who do not go to the Ziyārah of Ḥusain is incomplete."

Verily Allāh is the avenger of your blood on earth, the blood which cannot be avenged on earth except through (the hands of) your supporters. O Allāh! Make me love witnessing their sites and being in their presence until you allow me to join them and to be at their service, and make me among their followers in this life and in the Hereafter. Then walk a short distance and say “Allāhu Akbar” seven times. Then stop next to the grave and recite (the following): Sanctified is He whom the MULK and the MALAKŪT sanctify and whose names are glorified by all of His creation. Sanctified is Allāh, the King, the Holy, and the Lord of the angels and the (Holy) Spirit. O Allāh! Register me among Your visitors who have come to the best of Your places and to the best of Your creation. O Allāh! Curse the Jibt and the Ťāghūt and curse their followers and those who adhere to them. O Allāh! Allow me to witness all of the blessed sites in the company of the family of Your Prophet . O Allāh! Make me die as a Muslim and allow me to have a sure footing with the remaining heirs from among Your righteous slaves “who inherit Firdaws where they shall abide eternally” (23:11). Then say “Allāhu Akbar” five times, walk a short distance, and recite (the following): O Allāh! I believe in You and I am certain about Your promise. O Allāh! Sustain me with faith and make it steady in my heart. O Allāh! Make that which I say with my tongue be a truth in which I believe in my heart and laws to which I abide through my actions. O Allāh! Make me among those who have their foot steady with Ḥusain and register me among those who were martyred with him. Then say “Allāhu Akbar” three times and raise both of your hands and place them on the grave and recite (the following): I testify that you are pure and purified, and (you are the son) of the pure and the purified one. You are purified and the lands are purified through you. The dust in which you are lying is purified and your Ḥaram is (also) purified. I testify that you ordered (people) and invited (them) to justice and equity. Verily Allāh will avenge your blood on earth and verily He will take your revenge from all of His creation. Then place both of your cheeks on the grave. Then sit down and extol Allāh and supplicate to Him however you wish. Thereafter, come back to the grave and place your hands next to his feet and recite (the following): May Allāh’s blessings be upon your soul and upon your body. You (always) said the truth and you are the trustworthy and the truthful one. May Allāh kill anyone who participated in killing you with their hands and tongues. Then face ‘Ali , his son, and recite that which you wish. Then stand up, turn toward the grave of the martyrs, and recite (the following): Salām to you, O martyrs. You are our leaders and we shall (soon) follow you. Be delighted about the promise of Allāh which will not be broken. Allāh will avenge your blood and He will seek revenge from His enemies on earth through you. You are the Masters of the Martyrs in this life and in the Hereafter. Then face the grave (of Ḥusain ) and establish as many prayers as you want, and then recite (the following): I have come to you as your guest and I beseech Allāh through you for all of my requests in this life and in the Hereafter. Those who beseech Allāh, beseech Him for their requests through you. Those who seek revenge will be avenged by Allāh through you. Then say “Allāhu Akbar” eleven consecutive times without haste. Then walk a short distance, face the Qiblah, and recite (the following): Praise be to Allāh, the One, who runs all of the affairs alone. He created the creation and none of their affairs escape His knowledge; He knows everything with His power. The earth and those on it have guaranteed that your blood shall be avenged (in this life), O son of the Messenger of Allāh! May Allāh’s blessing be upon you. I testify that Allāh has promised to support you and achieve victory for you and that He has truly promised to destroy your enemies. Surely Allāh will fulfill His promise to you. : I testify that those who followed you are the truthful ones about whom Allāh, the Blessed and the Exalted, says, “They are the truthful ones; and they are witnesses (to the truth) before their Lord. They shall have their recompense and their light” (57:19). Then say “Allāhu Akbar” seven times and walk a short distance. Then face the grave (again) and recite (the following): Praise be to Allāh who “has not taken a son, for whom there is not a partner in the kingdom, and who created everything and determined for it a fixed measure” (25:2). I testify that you invited (the people) to Allāh and to His Messenger ﷺ and you fulfilled the covenant of Allāh. You rose with the words of Allāh and you fought in the way of Allāh until that which is certain (death) came to you. May Allāh’s curse be upon the party who killed you; may Allāh’s curse be upon the party who oppressed you; may Allāh’s curse be upon the party who abandoned you; and may Allāh’s curse be upon the party who betrayed you. O Allāh! I take You as witness that I love those whom You love and those whom Your messengers love. And I testify that I dissociate myself from those from whom You and Your messengers dissociate yourselves. O Allāh! Curse those who belied Your messengers, destroyed Your Ka’bah, distorted Your Book, spilled the blood of the family of Your Prophet, caused mischief in Your land, and disgraced Your slaves. O Allāh! Multiply Your chastisement on them as long as anyone travels on Your routes, Your lands, and Your seas. O Allāh! Curse them in Your earth and in Your heaven in the most secretive ways which are hidden and in the most public ways. Imam added, “And every time you enter the Ḥā`ir, say Salām (to Ḥusain ) and place your hands on the grave.”"

My father, ‘Ali ibn Ḥusain, and Muḥammad ibn Ḥasan all narrated to me from Sa’d ibn ‘Abdillāh, from Aḥmad ibn Muḥammad ibn ‘Isā, from Qāsim ibn Yaḥyā, from Ḥasan ibn Rāshid, from Ḥusain ibn Thuwayr ibn Abī Fākhitah, who said: Yūnus ibn Żabyān, Mufaďďal ibn ‘Umar, Abū Salamah Al-Sarrāj, and I were sitting with Abī ‘Abdillāh (Imam Sādiq ). Yūnus was the eldest among us and he spoke (to the Imam ) on our behalf. Yūnus asked, “May I sacrifice myself for you! What should I say when I attend the gatherings of these people – referring to Banī Abbās?” Imam replied, “When you attend their gatherings, extol us and then say, ‘O Allāh! Grant us ease and pleasure.’ Verily if you do this, you will see that which you want.” I (Ḥusain ibn Thuwayr) asked, “May I sacrifice myself for you! I remember Ḥusain increasingly. What should I say (when I remember him)?” Imam replied: You should repeat three times, “Salām to you, O Abā ‘Abdillāh.” Verily Salām reaches Ḥusain from near and far. Verily when Abū ‘Abdillāh (Imam Ḥusain ) died, the seven heavens, the seven earths, everything within them, everything between them, everyone who moves in Paradise and in Hell from among the creation of our Lord, and everything which can be seen and everything which cannot be seen, cried over Abī ‘Abdillāh except for three things. I asked, “May I sacrifice myself for you! What are those three things?” Imam replied, “Basra, Damascus, and the family of ‘Uthmān.” I asked, “May I sacrifice myself for you! I want to go to the Ziyārah of Ḥusain . How should I perform the Ziyārah and what should I recite?” Imam said: When you go to (the Ziyārah of) Abī ‘Abdillāh (Imam Ḥusain ), perform a Ghusl on the shores of the Euphrates (River) and wear your most purified clothes. Then walk barefoot (toward the grave) because you are (walking) in one of the Ḥarams of Allāh and His Messenger ﷺ. You should increasingly recite Takbīr and TAHLǏL and increasingly glorify and sanctify Allāh. Send blessings on Muḥammad ﷺ and his family until you arrive at the door of the Ḥā`ir. Then recite (the following): Salām to you, O Allāh’s Decisive Proof and son of His Decisive Proof. Salām to you, O Allāh’s angels who are the Zuwwār of the grave of the son of Allāh’s Prophet ﷺ. Then take ten steps, stop, and say “Allāhu Akbar” thirty times. Then walk toward the grave from the direction of the face. Stand (next to the grave) with your face toward his face and your back toward Qiblah and recite (the following): Salām to you, O Allāh’s Decisive Proof and the son of His Decisive Proof. Salam to you, O Allāh’s slain one and the son of His slain one. Salām to you, O one whose avenger is Allāh and the son of the one whose avenger is Allāh. Salām to you, O Allāh’s unavenged one in the heavens and the earth whose revenge is yet to be taken by Allāh. I testify that your blood has dwelled in the Eternal Paradise, the carriers of the Throne shivered because of it, and all of creation has wept over it. (I testify that) the seven heavens, the seven earths, that which is on them and that which is between them, and all of the creation of our Lord who move in Paradise and in Hell, from among that which can be seen and that which cannot be seen, cried over it (your blood). I testify that you are Allāh’s Decisive Proof and the son of His Decisive Proof. I testify that you are Allāh’s slain one and the son of His slain one. I testify that Allāh is your avenger and the avenger of your father on earth. I testify that you are Allāh’s unavenged one in the heavens and the earth whose revenge is yet to be taken by Allāh. I testify that you advised the people and announced (the message of Allāh). You were devoted and faithful to Allāh and you fought in the way of your Lord. I testify that you died with insight, the same way that you lived – as a martyr who desired martyrdom and as the witness (over Allāh’s creation) who was witnessed (by Allāh). I am Allāh’s slave and your servant who is at your service. I have come to you as a guest to beg (you) for the perfection of my position with Allāh and to keep my foot steady in following your path, and to beg for the path which does not prevent those who follow it from receiving a guarantee from you – the guarantee which Allāh has ordered you to give (to your followers). Those who seek Allāh, start with you. Those who seek Allāh, start with you. Those who seek Allāh, start with you. Allāh unfolds the lies through you and He keeps the times of affliction away (from us) through you. Allāh started (His creation) with you and He shall end (it) with you. And Allāh cancels or confirms that which He pleases through you. Allāh removes the disgrace from us through you and He shall avenge the unavenged blood of the believers through you. The trees in the earth grow through you and they become fruitful through you. And the skies rain and send down sustenance through you. Allāh removes the anguish (from the believers) through you and He showers down the rain (of mercy) through you. The earth which carries your bodies sanctifies Allāh through you. And it is through you that the mountains are firmly fixed in the land. The Will of Allāh with regards to His destined affairs descends to you and is issued (to the creation) from your houses. Similarly the true and detailed rulings, which govern Allāh’s slaves, are issued from your houses. Cursed are those who killed you, those who opposed you, those who denied your divine authority, those who supported one another against you, and those who were present but were not martyred with you. Praise be to Allāh who made Hell their final destination. What a terrible abode Hell is and what an evil dwelling their dwelling is! Praise be to Allāh, the Lord of the Worlds. Then repeat each of the following statements three times: May Allāh’s blessing be upon you, O Abā ‘Abdillāh. I seek nearness to Allāh by dissociating myself from those who opposed you. Then move toward (the grave of) his son, ‘Ali , who is located next to the feet of Ḥusain and recite (the following): Salām to you, O son of the Messenger of Allāh. Salām to you, O son of the Commander of the Believers. Salām to you, O son of Ḥasan and Ḥusain. Salām to you, O son of Khadījah, the Great, and O son of Fāťimah Al-Zahrā. Then repeat each of the following statements three times: May Allāh’s blessing be upon you. May Allāh’s curse be upon those who killed you. I seek nearness to Allāh by dissociating myself from them. Then stand up and point with your hand toward the Martyrs, repeating each of the following statements three times: Salām to you. I swear to Allāh that you have achieved victory. Then recite (the following): I wish I was among you so that I could have achieved a great victory. Then go around the grave and stand behind the grave of Abī ‘Abdillāh (Imam Ḥusain ) and establish six Rak’ah of prayers while facing the grave. By doing (all of) this, your Ziyārah is complete. You can choose to stay there or leave if you want."

My father and Muḥammad ibn Ḥasan both narrated to me from Ḥusain ibn Ḥasan ibn Abān, from Ḥusain ibn Sa’īd, from Faďālah ibn Ayyūb, from Nu’aym ibn Walīd, from Yūsuf Al-Kunāsi, who said: Abū ‘Abdillāh (Imam Sādiq ) said: When you go to (the Ziyārah of) the grave of Ḥusain , go to the Euphrates (River) first and perform a Ghusl in the part (of the river) which is opposite to the grave. Then walk toward him calmly and with reverence until you arrive at the Ḥā`ir. Enter from (the door on) the east side and recite (the following) upon entering: Salām upon Allāh’s High-Ranked angels. Salām upon Allāh’s descending angels. Salām upon Allāh’s “angels [who come] in an unbroken succession.” Salām upon Allāh’s “(fully equipped) distinguished angels.” Salām upon Allāh’s angels who reside in this Ḥā`ir with the permission of Allāh. When you face the grave of Ḥusain , recite (the following): Salām upon the Messenger of Allāh. May Allāh’s blessing be upon Muḥammad, Allāh’s Trustee over His messengers and over His firmly determined affairs, the last of that which has passed and the one who began that which is yet to come, and the absolute master over all of it. Salām to him and (may) Allāh’s Mercy and Blessings be upon him. Then recite (the following): Salām upon the Commander of the Believers, Your slave and the brother of Your Messenger, the one whom You chose with Your knowledge and appointed as a guide for whomever You willed from among Your creation, the guide to those with whom You sent Your messages, the undisputed ruler of religion with Your justice, the Decisive Judge between Your creation, and the absolute master over all of it. Salām to him and (may) Allāh’s Mercy and Blessings be upon him. O Allāh! Send Your blessing on Ḥasan ibn ‘Ali, Your slave and the son of Your Messenger, the one whom You chose with Your knowledge and appointed as a guide for whomever You willed from among Your creation, the guide to those with whom You sent Your messages, the undisputed ruler of religion with Your justice, the Decisive Judge between Your creation, and the absolute master over all of it. Salām to him and (may) Allāh’s Mercy and Blessings be upon him. Then send Salām to Ḥusain and to the rest of the Imams in the same way that you sent Salām and blessings on Ḥasan ibn ’Ali . Thereafter, go near the grave of Ḥusain and recite (the following): Salām to you, O Abā ‘Abdillāh! Salām to you, O son of the Messenger of Allāh. May Allāh’s blessing be upon you, O Abā ‘Abdillāh. May Allāh’s Mercy be upon you, O Abā ‘Abdillāh. I testify that you announced on behalf of Allāh that which He ordered you to and that you did not fear anyone but Allāh. (I testify that) you fought in His way and you worshipped Him truthfully and devoutly until that which is certain (death) came to you. I testify that you (the Imams ) are “the word of piety” (48:26), the door of guidance, the strongest handholds, and the Decisive Proofs on those who remain and those who are (buried) under the ground. I testify that you have always had these (positions) and they will remain (apparent) in you. I testify that your souls and your clay are blessed and they blessed and purified one another by the Mercy and the Favour of Allāh. I take Allāh and I take you as witnesses that I believe in you and I am certain about your return. I follow you in that which is related to me and that which is related to the rulings of my religion. I shall follow you in that which is related to the destiny of my deeds, to my return to Allāh, and to my abode. And I ask Allāh, the Kind, the Merciful, to fulfill this for me. I testify that you announced on behalf of Allāh that which He ordered you to and you did not fear anyone but Allāh. (I testify that) you fought in His way and worshipped Him until that which is certain (death) came to you. May Allāh’s curse be upon those who killed you. May Allāh’s curse be upon those who ordered them to do so. May Allāh’s curse be upon those who heard about your killing and were pleased with it. I testify that those who breached your sanctity and spilled your blood are cursed by the tongue of the Prophet of Makkah. Then recite (the following): O Allāh! Curse those who changed Your blessings, went against Your nation, turned away from Your orders, accused Your Messenger, and deviated (people) away from Your Path. O Allāh! Stuff their graves and their stomachs with fire and resurrect them and their followers in Hell while they are blind. O Allāh! Curse them in a way that (causes) every High-Ranked angel, every prophet who was sent as a messenger, and every believer whose heart has been tested with faith (to) curse them. O Allāh! Curse them (at all times), secretly and openly. O Allāh! Curse all of the Jibt(s), Ťāghūt(s), and the pharaohs of this nation. (O Allāh!) Curse the killers of the Commander of the Believers and curse the killers of Ḥasan and Ḥusain and torment them with a chastisement that is so painful that You will never punish anyone else from among (the inhabitants of) the worlds with it. O Allāh! Make us among those whom You support, those who support You, and those whom You favour by using them to support Your religion in this life and in the Hereafter. Then sit next to his head – may Allāh’s blessings be upon him – and recite (the following): May Allāh’s blessing be upon you. I testify that you are Allāh’s Slave and His Trustee, you announced (the message of Allāh) with loyalty, you fulfilled (your duties) faithfully, you were the most truthful one when you were killed, and you died while you were certain in your beliefs. (I testify that) you did not give preference to blindness over guidance and you never moved away from truth toward falsehood. I testify that you established prayers, gave charity, enjoined good, forbade evil, followed the Messenger ﷺ, recited the Book (Qur’an) the way it should be recited, and called (the people) to the path of your Lord with wisdom and by giving good counsel. May Allāh’s blessing and Salām be upon you increasingly. I testify that you had insight with regards to your Lord. You announced that which you were ordered to and you fulfilled your obligations toward Allāh. You believed in the truth of those (appointed by Allāh) who preceded you without weakness or languor. May Allāh’s blessing and Salām be upon you. May Allāh reward you abundantly on behalf of your nation, O most truthful one. I testify that Jihād (fighting in the way of Allāh) is Jihād only if it is with you, that Ḥaqq is with you and (it leads) to you, that you are the people of Ḥaqq and its source, and that the inheritance of prophethood is with you and with your family . I testify that you are regarded as the most truthful one with Allāh and you are His Decisive Proof on His creation. I testify that your call is Ḥaqq, and that any other caller who has been appointed (by the people) is invalid and false. And I testify that Allāh is the Manifesting Ḥaqq. Then move toward his feet and choose some supplications to recite and pray for yourself. Thereafter, move toward the head of ‘Ali ibn Ḥusain and recite (the following): Salām of Allāh, Salām of His High-Ranked Angels, and Salām of His prophets who were sent as messengers be upon you, O my master and the son of my master. May Allāh’s Mercy and Blessings be upon you. May Allāh’s blessing be upon you, your family, and the offspring of your righteous and pious fathers, those from whom Allāh kept away the impurities and whom Allāh purified with a thorough purification. Then go to the graves of the martyrs and say Salām to them by reciting (the following): : Salām to you, O godly men. You have preceded us and you are our leaders and we are your followers and supporters. I testify that you are Allāh’s supporters as Allāh, the Blessed and the Exalted, says in His Book, “And many a prophet has fought with innumerable godly men beside him, while they did not lose heart for anything that befell them in the way of Allāh, nor they weakened, nor they humbled themselves before their enemies” (3:146). Verily you did not lose heart, you were not weakened, and you did not humble yourselves before your enemies until you met Allāh on the Path of Truth while supporting Allāh’s Most Complete Word (Imam Ḥusain ). May Allāh’s blessing and His worthy Salām be upon your souls and your bodies. Rejoice in the promise of Allāh which will not fail. “Verily Allāh does not fail His promise” (3:9) and Allāh shall avenge you as He promised you. You are the Masters of the Martyrs in this life and in the Hereafter and you are the foremost, those who migrated, and the supporters. I testify that you fought in the way of Allāh and you were killed while following the traditions of the Messenger of Allāh and the son of the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ. Praise be to Allāh who fulfilled His promise to you and showed you that which you love. Then (bid farewell to Ḥusain and) recite (the following): I have come to you, O love of the Messenger of Allāh and the son of His Messenger ﷺ, while I believe in you (your status), testify to your rights, am endowed with insight into your merits, am certain about the corruption of those who opposed you, and while I believe in the path of guidance on which you are. May I sacrifice my father, my mother, and myself for you. O Allāh! I send blessing on him (Ḥusain ) just as You, Your messengers, and the Commander of the Believers send blessings on him, blessings which are continuous and frequent, blessings which follow one another in an unbroken succession, blessings which do not stop and for which there is no ending nor any limit. (O Allāh! Send these blessings on him) while we are here and continue to send them when we leave and when we come back (to this Ziyārah). Salām to him (Ḥusain ) and (may) Allāh’s Mercy and Blessings be upon him."

My father and Muḥammad ibn ‘Abdillāh both narrated to me from ‘Abdillāh ibn Ja’far Al-Ḥimyari, from ‘Abdillāh ibn Muḥammad ibn Khālid Al-Ťayālisi, from Ḥasan ibn ‘Ali (Al-Washā), from his father, from Faďl ibn ‘Uthmān Al-Sāyigh, from Mu’āwiyah ibn ‘Ammār, who said: I asked Abā ‘Abdillāh (Imam Sādiq ), “What should I recite when I go to (the Ziyārah of) the grave of Ḥusain ?” Imam replied, recite (the following): Salām to you, O Abā ‘Abdillāh. May Allāh’s blessing be upon you, O Abā ‘Abdillāh. May Allāh’s Mercy be upon you, O Abā ‘Abdillāh. May Allāh’s curse be upon those who killed you. May Allāh’s curse be upon those who participated in spilling your blood and may Allāh’s curse be upon those who heard of your killing and were pleased with it. I seek nearness to Allāh by dissociating myself from this (being pleased with the killing of Ḥusain )."

My father narrated to me from Sa’d ibn ‘Abdillāh, from Abī ‘Abdillāh Al-Rāzi, from Ḥasan ibn ‘Ali ibn Abī Ḥamzah, from Abī ‘Ali Ḥasan ibn Muḥammad ibn ‘Abdil Karīm, from Mufaďďal ibn ‘Umar, from Jābir Al-Ju’fi, who said: Abū ‘Abdillāh (Imam Sādiq ) asked Mufaďďal, “What is the distance between you and the grave of Ḥusain ?” He replied, “May I sacrifice my father and mother for you. A little more than a day.” Imam asked, “Do you go to his Ziyārah?” He replied, “Yes.” Imam asked, “Should I not give you glad tidings?! Should I not please you by telling you about some of its rewards?” He replied, “May I sacrifice myself for you! Yes.” Imam said: When a man among you starts preparing and packing for going to his Ziyārah, the inhabitants of the heavens give one another glad tidings about him. As soon as he leaves his house, riding or walking, Allāh dedicates four thousand angels to him who send blessings on him until he arrives at the grave of Ḥusain . O Mufaďďal! When you go to the grave of Ḥusain ibn ‘Ali , stand at the door (of the Ḥaram) and recite these words, for verily if you do, you will receive an increasing share of Allāh’s Mercy for every word you recite. He asked, “May I sacrifice myself for you! What should I recite?” Imam said: Recite (the following): Salām to you, O heir of Ādam, the Chosen Slave of Allāh. Salām to you, O heir of Nūḥ, the Prophet of Allāh. Salām to you, O heir of Ibrāhīm, the Friend of Allāh. Salām to you, O heir of Mūsā, the One Addressed by Allāh. Salām to you, O heir of ‘Ǐsā, the Spirit of Allāh. Salām to you, O heir of Muḥammad, the Love of Allāh. Salām to you, O heir of ‘Ali, the Successor of the Messenger of Allāh. Salām to you, O heir of Ḥasan, the one with whom Allāh is pleased. Salām to you, O heir of Fāťimah, Daughter of the Messenger of Allāh. Salām to you, O Truthful Martyr. Salām to you, O Pure and Pious Successor. Salām to you, O Allāh’s Decisive Proof and the son of His Decisive Proof. Salām upon the souls who dismounted at your vicinity and stayed in your caravan. Salām upon Allāh’s angels who have surrounded you. I testify that you established prayers, gave charity, enjoined good, forbade evil, and worshipped Allāh devoutly until that which is certain (death) came to you. Salām to you and (may) Allāh’s Mercy and Blessings be upon you. Then walk toward the grave, for you shall have the reward of those who were ensanguined in their blood in the way of Allāh for every step that you take. Once you have said Salām at the grave, touch it with your hands and recite (the following): Salām to you, O Allāh’s Decisive Proof in His heavens and earth. Then carry on with establishing prayers, for you shall have the reward of performing one thousand Hajj and ‘Umrah, freeing one thousand slaves, and fighting in the way of Allāh one thousand times with a prophet, who was sent as a messenger, for every Rak’ah of prayer next to the grave of Ḥusain . When you are leaving the grave of Ḥusain , a caller will call out something to you. If you could hear it, you would stay next to the grave of Ḥusain for the rest of your life. The caller calls out, “Bliss for you, O slave (of Allāh)! You have achieved victory and you shall be safe (on the Day of Judgment). Verily your past sins have been forgiven so continue with good deeds.” No one but Allāh Himself takes the soul of one who dies in the night or the day of performing the Ziyārah or even within one year (from the Ziyārah). The angels will accompany those who return from the Ziyārah of Ḥusain while seeking forgiveness for them and sending blessings on them until they arrive at their homes. Then the angels will say to Allāh, “O Lord! This slave of Yours went to (the Ziyārah of) the grave of the son of Your Prophet ﷺ and now he has returned to his home. So where should we go?” They will hear a call from the heavens which says, “O My angels! Stay next to the door of the house of My slave until he dies while sanctifying and glorifying Me, and register these deeds among his good deeds.” So they will remain next to his house, sanctifying and glorifying Allāh and registering it among his (the Zā`ir’s) good deeds until he dies. Then they will attend his funeral, shroud him, perform his Ghusl, and establish prayers on him. Then they will say, “O Our Lord! You dedicated us to the door of the house of Your slave and now he has died. So where should we go?” Allāh will call out to them, “O My angels! Stay next to the grave of My slave until the Day of Judgment while sanctifying and glorifying Me, and register these deeds among his good deeds.” The above Ḥadīth has also been narrated to me through the following chain: Ḥukaym ibn Dāwūd ibn Ḥukaym, from Salamah ibn Khaťťāb, from Abī ‘Abdillāh Al-Rāzi Al-Jāmūrāni, from Ḥasan ibn ‘Ali ibn Abī Ḥamzah, from Abī ‘Ali Ḥasan ibn Muḥammad ibn ‘Abdil Karīm, from Mufaďďal ibn ‘Umar, from Jābir Al-Ju’fi, from Abī ‘Abdillāh ."

Salām to you, O son of the Commander of the Believers. Salām to you, O Abā ‘Abdillāh. Salām to you, O Master of the Youth of Paradise and (may) Allāh’s Mercy and Blessings be upon you. Salām to you, O one whose pleasure is derived from the pleasure of Al-Raḥmān (the most Gracious) and whose displeasure is derived from the displeasure of Al-Raḥmān. Salām to you, O Allāh’s Trustee, His Decisive Proof, the door (which opens) to Allāh, the guide to Allāh, and the caller to Allāh. I testify that you deemed lawful that which Allāh has declared lawful and you deemed unlawful that which Allāh has declared unlawful. You established prayers, gave charity, enjoined good, forbade evil, and called (the people) to the path of your Lord with wisdom and by giving good counsel. And I testify that you and those who were killed with you are Martyrs who “are alive with [your] Lord getting sustenance from Him” (3:169). And I testify that your killers are in Hell. I follow the religion of Allāh by dissociating myself from those who fought you, those who killed you, those who accompanied them, those who gathered (an army) against you, and from those who heard your voice (calling for help) but did not answer your call. I wish I had been with you so that I would have achieved the great victory."

Muḥammad ibn Ja’far narrated to me from Muḥammad ibn Ḥusain, from Muḥammad ibn Ismā’īl, from Sāliḥ ibn ‘Uqbah, from Abī Sa’īd Al-Madā`ini, who said: I went to Abī ‘Abdillāh (Imam Sādiq ) and asked, “May I sacrifice myself for you! Should I go to (the Ziyārah of) the grave of Ḥusain ?” Imam replied: Yes, O Abā Sa’īd! Go to (the Ziyārah of) the grave of Ḥusain , the most blessed of the blessed ones, the most purified of the purified ones, and the most pious of the pious ones. O Abā Sa’īd! When you go to his Ziyārah, recite the TASBǏḤ of the Commander of the Believers next to his (Ḥusain’s) head one thousand times and recite the Tasbīḥ of Fāťimah Al-Zahrā (s.a.) next to his feet one thousand times. Then establish two Rak’ah of prayers there. Recite Yāsīn in the first Rak’ah and Al-Raḥmān in the second Rak’ah. Verily if you do this, Allāh will register its (special) rewards for you In-Shā`allāh. I said, “May I sacrifice myself for you! Teach me the Tasbīḥ of ‘Ali and Fāťimah .” Imam replied: Yes, O Abā Sa’īd! The Tasbīḥ of ‘Ali is as follows: Sanctified is He whose Treasury is inexhaustible. Sanctified is He whose signs do not perish. Sanctified is He whom that which is with Him will not vanish. Sanctified is He who does not share His ruling with anyone. Sanctified is He whose Glory does not fade away. Sanctified is He whose time does not end. Sanctified is He besides whom there is no god. And the Tasbīḥ of Fāťimah (s.a.) is as follows: Sanctified is the Owner of Majesty, the Exalted, the Great. Sanctified is the Owner of Glory, the High, the Exalted. Sanctified is the Owner of the Kingdom, the Superior, the Everlasting. Sanctified is the Owner of Grace and Beauty. Sanctified is He who is covered with Light and Dignity. Sanctified is He who sees the markings of an ant on flat stones and the perching of the birds (which fly) in the sky."

My father and others narrated to me from Sa’d ibn ‘Abdillāh, from Aḥmad ibn Muḥammad ibn ‘Isā, from ‘Abbās ibn Mūsā Al-Warrāq, from Yūnus (ibn ‘Abdil Raḥmān), from ‘Āmir ibn Judhā’ah, who said: I heard Abā ‘Abdillāh (Imam Sādiq ) say: When you go to the grave of Ḥusain , recite (the following): Salām to you, O son of the Messenger of Allāh. Salām to you, O Abā ‘Abdillāh. May Allāh’s curse be upon those who killed you. And may Allāh’s curse be upon those who heard about your killing and were pleased with it. I seek nearness to Allāh by dissociating myself from them. Ḥusain ibn Muḥammad ibn ‘Āmir narrated to me from Aḥmad ibn Isḥāq ibn Sa’d, from Sa’dān ibn Muslim – Abī Basīr’s guide, from some of our companions, who said: Abū ‘Abdillāh (Imam Sādiq ) said: When you go to the Grave (of Ḥusain ), start by praising Allāh, the Great and Almighty, and sending blessing on the Prophet ﷺ, and strive in doing so. Thereafter, recite (the following): Salām of Allāh be upon you and Salām of His angels be upon you along with the Purified and the Blessed greetings which reach you at all times. Salām of Allāh and Salām of His High-Ranked angels be upon you as well as the Salām of those whose hearts are submissive to you, those who speak of your merits, and those who testify that you are honest and truthful, that you were truthful about that which you invited (the people) to, that you are the one whom Allāh will avenge on earth, and (who testify) that your blood cannot be avenged by anyone from among the inhabitants of the earth and that no one but Allāh shall avenge it. I have come to you, O son of the Messenger of Allāh as your guest, beseeching Allāh through you for all of my requests in this life and in the Hereafter. Verily those who beseech Allāh, beseech Him for their requests through you, and those who seek revenge from among Allāh’s slaves will be avenged (by Allāh) through you. Then take a few steps, face the grave with your back toward Qiblah, and recite (the following): Praise be to Allāh, the One, the Only One who runs all of the affairs, the Creator of the creation, who is aware of all of the affairs of His creation, and the One who has the knowledge of everything without learning. O son of the Messenger of Allāh! The earth and everyone on it is responsible for your blood and for avenging you. I testify that Allāh will fulfill His promise of support and victory to you and (I testify) that Allāh will fulfill His true promise to you and complete it by destroying your enemies. : I testify that innumerable godly men fought beside you as Allāh, the Exalted, says, “And many a prophet has fought with innumerable godly men beside him, while they did not lose heart for anything that befell them” (3:146). Then say ""Allāhu Akbar"" seven times, take a few steps, face the grave, and recite (the following): Praise be to Allāh who has not taken (unto Himself) a wife or a son, neither has He any partner in the kingdom, the One who created everything and determined for it a fixed measure. I testify that you announced (to people) that which Allāh ordered you to (announce) on His behalf, that you fulfilled the covenant of Allāh, and that Allāh’s words are complete with you. (I testify that) you fought in the way of Allāh until that which is certain (death) came to you. May Allāh’s curse be upon the nation who killed you and upon the nation who abandoned you. And may Allāh’s curse be upon the nation who made others abandon you. O Allāh! I testify that I love those whom You and Your messengers love. And I testify that I dissociate myself from those from whom You and Your messengers dissociate yourselves. O Allāh! Curse those who belied Your Messenger, destroyed Your Ka’bah, modified (the meaning of) Your Book, spilled the blood of the family of Your Prophet, and ruined Your slaves and disgraced them. O Allāh! Multiply Your curses on them based on Your traditions in Your lands and Your seas. O Allāh! Curse them in Your heavens and in Your earth. O Allāh! Appoint for me a truthful tongue among Your Divine Authorities and make me love their sites until You unite me with them. (O Allāh!) Make them my leaders and appoint me among their followers in this life and in the Hereafter. Then take a few steps, recite Takbīr seven times, recite Tahlīl seven times, praise Allāh seven times, and sanctify Allāh, the Exalted, seven times. Then answer the call of Ḥusain seven times by saying: I am at your service, O caller to Allāh! Then recite (the following): Even though my body could not answer your call (for help), my heart, my hair, my skin, my volition, and my desire have answered your call and have submitted to the remainder of the Prophet who was sent as a messenger, the chosen grandson, the knowledgeable guide, the entrusted guardian, the successor who announced the message (of Allāh), and the wronged and oppressed one. I have come solely to you, to your son, and to the son of your son, the one who, with the blessing of Ḥaqq, remains after you. My heart has submitted to you. I follow you in my affairs and my support is ready for you until Allāh judges for my religion, and He is the best of judges. And until Allāh resurrects you, I shall be with you and only with you, and not with your enemies. Verily I believe in your return (at the end of time). I do not deny the power of Allāh, I do not belie His Will, and I do not believe that something that Allāh has willed might not take place. Then walk to the grave, stand next to it, and recite (the following): Glory be to Allāh. All of Allāh’s creation glorify Him and sanctify the names of Allāh, the Owner of the Kingdom and the Sovereignty. Glory be to Allāh, the King, the most Holy, our Lord and the Lord of the Angels and the Spirit. O Allāh! Register me among Your guests who have come to the best of Your places and to the best of Your creation. O Allāh! Curse the Jibt and the Ťāghūt. Then raise your hands and spread your arms on the grave and recite (the following): I testify that you are purity and you are pure, and you are (the son) of purity and the pure one. Verily the lands have been purified through you and the land in which you are (buried) is purified (through you). You are Allāh’s unavenged one on earth until He takes your revenge from all of His creation. Then place both your cheeks and hands on the grave. Thereafter, sit next to his head and extol Allāh however you wish. Beseech Him and ask for your needs. Then (go next to his feet and) place your hands and your cheeks next to his feet and recite (the following): May Allāh’s blessing be upon you, upon your soul and your body. Verily you said the truth and you stayed patient. You are the truthful one whose truthfulness is authenticated (by Allāh). May Allāh kill those who killed you with their hands and their tongues. Then go to the grave of his sons and praise them however you wish. Then ask your Lord for your needs and for that which you want. Then face the graves of the martyrs and recite (the following) while standing: Salām to you, O godly men. You have preceded us and you are our leaders while we are the followers and the supporters. Rejoice in the promise of Allāh which will not fail. Verily Allāh shall avenge you (as He promised you). You are the Masters of the Martyrs in this life and in the Hereafter. Then stand behind the grave and establish prayers as much as you want. Imam added: Every time you go to the Ḥā`ir, say Salām and then walk to the grave and place both your hands and your cheeks on the grave. Do the same when you want to leave. Establish the prayers in full form next to his grave as long as you stay (in Karbalā). When you want to leave (the Ḥā`ir), bid farewell to him by saying: Salām of Allāh and Salām of His High-Ranked Angels and His prophets who were sent as messengers and His Righteous Slaves be upon you, O son of the Messenger of Allāh, upon your soul and your body, upon your offspring, and upon those of your friends who come to you. The above Ziyārah has also been narrated to me through the following chain: Aḥmad ibn Muḥammad ibn Ḥasan ibn Sahl, from his father, from his grandfather, from Mūsā ibn Ḥasan ibn ‘Āmir, from Aḥmad ibn Hilāl, from Umayyah ibn ‘Ali Al-Qaysi Al-Shāmi, from Sa’dān ibn Muslim, from someone, from Abī ‘Abdillāh – with the following addition at the end: And when you want to return (to your home), repeat this entire Ziyārah just like when you first entered the Ḥā`ir. Once you arrive at your home, recite (the following): Praise be to Allāh who kept me safe and kept others safe from me. Praise be to Allāh in all of the affairs and in every state. Praise be to Allāh, the Lord of the Worlds. Then say “Allāhu Akbar” twenty-one consecutive times. Recite them carefully and without haste In-Shā`allāh."

I asked, “May I sacrifice myself for you! What should I recite when I go to his Ziyārah?” Imam said, recite (the following): Salām to you, O Abā ‘Abdillāh. Salām to you, O son of the Messenger of Allāh. Salām to you on the day you were born, on the day of your death, and on the day on which you will be resurrected. I testify that you are a martyr who is alive, you are with your Lord while you receive sustenance. I love those who love you and I dissociate myself from your enemies. And I testify that those who fought you and breached your sanctity are cursed by the tongue of the Prophet of Makkah. And I testify that you established prayers, gave charity, enjoined good, forbade evil, and fought in the way of your Lord with wisdom and by giving good counsel. I ask Allāh, your Master and our Master, to send blessing on our Prophet and to forgive our sins as our gift for having performed your Ziyārah. O son of the Messenger of Allāh! Intercede on my behalf with your Lord."

Salām to you, O son of the Messenger of Allāh. May Allāh’s curse be upon those who killed you. May Allāh’s curse be upon those who helped (your enemies) against you and upon those who heard about your killing and were pleased with it. I seek nearness to Allāh by dissociating myself from them."

Abū ‘Abdil Raḥmān Muḥammad ibn Aḥmad ibn Ḥusain Al-‘Askari and Muḥammad ibn Ḥasan both narrated to me from Ḥasan ibn ‘Ali ibn Mahziyār, from his father ‘Ali ibn Mahziyār, from Muḥammad ibn Abī ‘Umayr, from Muḥammad ibn Marwān, from Abī Ḥamzah Al-Thumāli, who said: Imam Sādiq said: When you want to go to (the Ziyārah of) the grave of Ḥusain , fast Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. When you want to leave (your house), gather your family and your children and recite the supplication of traveling. Perform a Ghusl before you leave and recite (the following) during the Ghusl: O Allāh! Purify me and purify my heart. Expand my chest and allow my tongue to extol, glorify, and praise You. Verily there is no power except with You. I have surely understood that the foundation of my religion is submitting to Your orders, following the traditions of Your Prophet, and testifying to the truth of all of Your prophets and Your messengers whom You sent to all of Your creation. O Allāh! Make this (Ghusl) a light and a purification (for me) and make it my cure from every illness, disease, plague, and disability, and make it my protection against the evil of that which frightens and alerts me. Then recite (the following) when you are leaving (your house): O Allāh! I have turned my face toward You, entrusted my affairs to You, submitted myself to You, protected my back with You, and I have relied on You. There is no refuge nor shelter except with You. You are Blessed and Exalted. Mighty is Your protection and Exalted is Your praise. Then recite (the following): (I start) in the name of Allāh, by Allāh, from Allāh, to Allāh, and in the way of Allāh as one who is in the nation of the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ. I rely on Allāh and to Him I shall return. He is the Creator of the Seven Heavens and the Seven Earths and the Lord of the Great Throne. O Allāh! Send Your blessing on Muḥammad and the family of Muḥammad. Protect me on my journey and act as my replacement for my family in the best way. O Allāh! I have turned toward You, I am traveling to You, I am coming to You as Your guest, I have exposed myself to Your blessings, and I seek nearness (to You) through the Ziyārah of the love of Your Love. O Allāh! Do not deprive me of the blessings which are with You because of the evil that I have with me. O Allāh! Forgive my sins, pardon my bad deeds, erase my errors, and accept my good deeds. Then recite (the following) three times: O Allāh! Place me in Your protective shield in which You place whomsoever You will. O Allāh! Verily I dissociate myself from any will and power except through You. Then recite Fātiḥatal Kitāb, Mu’awwadhatayn, Qul Huwallāhu Aḥad, Innā Anzalnāh, Āyatal Kursī, Yā Sīn, and the end of the Chapter of Ḥashr: * * * “Had We sent down this Qur’an on a mountain, You would certainly have seen it humbled and rent asunder for fear of Allāh. We propound such similitudes unto mankind that haply they may reflect. He is Allāh, there is no god but He, the knower of the unseen and the seen. He is the beneficent, the merciful. He is Allāh, there is no god but He, the king, the holy, the peaceloving, the bestower of conviction, the guardian, the glorified, the supreme, the great absolute. Far too exalted is Allāh from that which they associate (with Him). He is Allāh, the creator, the maker, the fashioner. His are all the beautiful names. Whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth glorifies Him. He is glorified, all-wise” (59:21-24). Do not use scented oils or kohl until you reach the Euphrates (River), and speak and joke less. Increasingly glorify Allāh, the Exalted, and beware of quarrelling or being cheerful. Recite (the following) when you are walking or riding: O Allāh! I seek refuge with You from the punishments of the dominating powers, from the evil endings, from the afflictions caused by going astray, and from any misfortunes that You may find with me. I seek refuge with You from being imprisoned, from confusion, from the whispers of Shayťān, from terrible misfortunes, from the evil of anyone with evil, from the evil of the demons from among the Jinn and mankind, and from the evil of those who incite animosity against the Walī of Allāh and from their aggression and violence against me. I seek refuge with You from the spies of the oppressors, from the evil of anyone with evil, from the traps of Iblīs, and from those who prevent (the people) from (seeking) blessings with their hands and their tongues. If you were afraid of something, recite (the following): There is no will nor power except with Allāh. I seek refuge and protect myself with Him. O Allāh! Protect me from the evil of Your creation, for verily I am Your slave and (I have sought refuge) with You. When you reach the Euphrates (River), recite (the following) before crossing it: O Allāh! You are the best one to whom men have traveled, and You, O my Master, are the most honourable one to whom one can go and the most honourable one to be visited. You have appointed a present for every Zā`ir and a gift for every guest, and I have come to You as a Zā`ir of the grave of the son of Your Prophet – may Your blessings be upon him. Therefore, make releasing me from Hell Your gift to me. Accept my deed, appreciate my efforts, and have mercy on me for traveling to You, although I do not consider this a favour from me. Rather, the favour is from You to me for making it possible for me to come to his Ziyārah, for allowing me to know his merits, and for protecting me until I arrived at the grave of the son of Your Walī. I have wished for Your Mercy so send Your blessing on Muḥammad and the family of Muḥammad. Do not deprive me of that which I have wished for. I have come to You so do not disappoint me. And make this (Ziyārah) a penance for my past sins and make me among his supporters, O Most Merciful of the merciful ones. Then cross the Euphrates (River) and recite (the following): O Allāh! Send Your blessing on Muḥammad and the family of Muḥammad. Allow my efforts to be appreciated, my sins to be forgiven, and my deeds to be accepted. And cleanse me from mistakes and sins and purify my heart from any disease which destroys my religion and nullifies my deeds, O Most Merciful of the merciful ones. Then enter Naynawā (Karbalā) and settle there. Do not use any scented oils or kohl and do not eat meat as long as you are there. Then come to the shore (of the Euphrates River) in its closest part to the grave (of Ḥusain ) and perform a Ghusl while you are covered. Recite (the following) while performing Ghusl: O Allāh! Purify me and purify my heart, expand my chest, and allow my tongue to praise and glorify You and to speak of Your love. Verily there is no will nor power except with You. I have surely understood that the foundation of my religion is submitting to Your orders and testifying that all of Your prophets and Your messengers are united. I testify that they are all Your prophets and messengers who were sent to all of Your creation. O Allāh! Make this (Ghusl) a light and a purification for me and make it my cure from every illness, disease, plague, and disability, and make it my protection against the evil of that which frightens and alerts me. O Allāh! Purify my heart, my organs, my bones, my flesh, my blood, my hair, my skin, my brain, my nerves, and my mass which is carried by earth with this Ghusl. Make it my witness on the day of my poverty and need (the Day of Judgment). Then wear the most purified of your clothes and say “Allāhu Akbar” thirty times. Then recite (the following): Praise be to Allāh whom I sought and He allowed me to reach Him, the One whom I wanted and He accepted me and He did not deprive me, the One whose Mercy I desired and He kept me safe. O Allāh! You are my protective castle and cave, You are my refuge, my hope, and my wish. There is no god but You, O Lord of the Worlds. Recite (the following) when you want to start walking (toward the grave): O Allāh! I want You (Your nearness) so want (that for) me. I have turned my face toward You so do not turn Your face away from me. And if You are dissatisfied with me, accept my repentance and have mercy on me for traveling to the son of Your Love while seeking to please You. Therefore, be pleased with me and do not disappoint me, O Most Merciful of the merciful ones. Then walk barefoot calmly and with reverence while (continuously) reciting Takbīr and Tahlīl, and glorifying, praising, and extolling Allāh and His Messenger ﷺ. Also recite (the following): Praise be to Allāh, the One, who runs all of the affairs alone. He is the Creator of the creation, and none of their affairs escape Him. He knows everything without being taught. May Allāh’s blessings and the blessings of His High-Ranked angels and all of His prophets, who were sent as messengers, be upon Muḥammad and his family, (who are) the successors. Praise be to Allāh who bestowed His favours upon me by making me understand the merits of Muḥammad and his family ﷺ. Then walk a short distance taking small steps. Once you arrive at the mound, face the grave, stop, and say “Allāhu Akbar” thirty times. Then recite (the following): There is no god but Allāh, (this is a Tahlīl which is) in His knowledge and in the extent of His knowledge. And there is no god but Allāh, (this is a Tahlīl which is) after His knowledge and in the extent of His knowledge. And there is no god but Allāh, (this is a Tahlīl which is) with His knowledge and in the extent of His knowledge. Praise is due to Allāh, (this is a praise which is) in His knowledge and in the extent of His knowledge. And praise is due to Allāh, (this is a praise which is) after His knowledge and in the extent of His knowledge. And praise is due to Allāh, (this is a praise which is) with His knowledge and in the extent of His knowledge. Sanctified is Allāh, (this is a sanctification which is) in His knowledge and in the extent of His knowledge. And sanctified is Allāh, (this is a sanctification which is) after His knowledge and in the extent of His knowledge. And sanctified is Allāh, (this is a sanctification which is) with His knowledge and in the extent of His knowledge. And praise is due to Allāh with all of His praises and for all of His blessings. There is no god but Allāh and Allāh is the Greatest, and He truly is worthy of that. There is no god but Allāh, the Patient, the Honourable. There is no god but Allāh, the Exalted, the Great. There is no god but Allāh, the light of the seven heavens, the light of the seven earths, and the light of the Great Throne. And praise be to Allāh, the Lord of the Worlds. Salām to you, O Allāh’s Decisive Proof and the son of His Decisive Proof. Salām to you, O Allāh’s angels and the Zuwwār of the grave of the son of Allāh’s Prophet ﷺ. Then take ten steps, say “Allāhu Akbar” thirty times and recite (the following) while walking: There is no god but Allāh. (This is) a Tahlīl which cannot be counted by anyone other than Allāh and which existed before anyone, which will exist after everyone, which exists with everyone, and which is equal to the number of everyone. Sanctified is Allāh. (This is) a Tasbīḥ which cannot be counted by anyone other than Allāh and which existed before anyone, which will exist after everyone, which exists with everyone, and which is equal to the number of everyone. Sanctified is Allāh, and praise be to Allāh, and there is no god but Allāh, and Allāh is the Greatest before anyone, after everyone, with everyone, and equal to the number of everyone, forever and ever and ever. O Allāh! I take You as witness and You are sufficient as a witness. Therefore, be my witness that: I testify to Your Truth and the truth of Your Messenger, the truth of Your Words, the truth of Your Will, the truth of Your Predestining, the truth of Your Actions, the truth of Your Resurrecting, the truth of Your Hell, and the truth of Your Paradise. I testify that You truly take the life of those who are alive and give life to the dead ones, that You will surely resurrect those who are in the graves, that You will gather the people for a Day about which there is no doubt, and that You do not go against Your promises. Salām to you, O Allāh’s Decisive Proof and son of His Decisive Proof. Salām to you, O Allāh’s angels and O Zuwwār of the grave of Abī ‘Abdillāh . Then walk a short distance, taking small steps calmly and with reverence while (continuously) reciting Takbīr and Tahlīl and while glorifying, praising, and extolling Allāh and His Messenger ﷺ. Once you arrive at the eastern door, stand at the door and recite (the following): I testify that there is no god but Allāh. He is alone and He has no partners. And I testify that Muḥammad ﷺ is His slave and Messenger, that he is Allāh’s Trustee over His creation, and that he is the master of the first and the last and the master of the prophets and messengers. Salām be upon the Messenger of Allāh. Praise be to Allāh who guided us to this and if it was not for Allāh’s guidance, we would not have been guided. Verily the messengers of our Lord came with the truth. O Allāh! I testify that this is the grave of the son of Your Love and Your Chosen One from among Your creation and he has achieved victory with Your Honour. You have honoured him with Your Book, designated him and entrusted him with Your revelation, given him the inheritance of the prophets, and appointed him to be a Decisive Proof from among the Chosen Ones on Your creation. He strived to call the people (toward You). He gave the blood of his heart in Your way to save Your slaves from going astray, from ignorance and blindness, and from doubt and confusion, and to lead them to the door of guidance, away from perishing. Verily You see (everything) but cannot be seen and You are at the Highest place where You observe everything. (He guided the people to You) until some of Your creation, who were allured by this world and who had sold their Hereafter for the lowest and least valuable of prices, rose against him and angered You and Your Messenger by obeying the dissolute ones, the hypocrites, the sinful ones, and those upon whom Hell is made mandatory from among Your slaves. May Allāh’s curse be upon the killers of the son of Your Messenger and may their painful chastisement be multiplied. Then go closer (to the grave) and recite (the following): Salām to you, O heir of Ādam, the Chosen Slave of Allāh. Salām to you, O heir of Nūḥ, the Prophet of Allāh. Salām to you, O heir of Ibrāhīm, the Friend of Allāh. Salām to you, O heir of Mūsā, the One Addressed by Allāh. Salām to you, O heir of ‘Ǐsā, the Spirit of Allāh. Salām to you, O heir of Muḥammad, the Love of Allāh. Salām to you, O heir of the Commander of the Believers, ‘Ali ibn Abī Ťālib, the Successor of the Messenger of Allāh. Salām to you, O heir of Ḥasan ibn ‘Ali, the Pious. Salām to you, O heir of Fāťimah Al-Zahrā, Master of the Women of the Worlds and the Most Truthful One. Salām to you, O Most Truthful Martyr. Salām to you, O Pleasant, Pious, and Pure Successor. Salām to you, O Loyal and Righteous One. I testify that you established prayers, gave charity, enjoined good, forbade evil, and worshipped Allāh devoutly until that which is certain (death) came to you. Salām to you, O Abā ‘Abdillāh and (may) Allāh’s Mercy and Blessings be upon you. Salām to you and to the souls who dismounted at your vicinity and stayed in your caravan. Salām upon Allāh’s angels who have surrounded you. Salām upon Allāh’s angels and the Zuwwār of the grave of the son of Allāh’s Prophet. Then enter the Ḥā`ir and recite (the following) while entering: Salām upon Allāh’s High-Ranked angels. Salām upon Allāh’s descending angels. Salām upon Allāh’s (fully equipped) distinguished angels. Salām upon Allāh’s angels who reside in this Ḥā`ir with the permission of Allāh. Salām upon Allāh’s angels who work in this Ḥā`ir and submit to the orders of Allāh. Salām to you, O son of the Messenger of Allāh, son of Allāh’s Trustee, and son of Allāh’s Devoted Slave. Salām to you, O Abā ‘Abdillāh. Verily we are Allāh’s and to Him we shall return. ﷺ How great your tragedy is with your grandfather, the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ!!! And how great your tragedy is with those who know Allāh, the Great and Almighty?!!! And how great is your tragedy with the exalted assembly (high above) and with Allāh’s prophets and messengers?!!! My Salām and greetings to you while I am greatly anguished over you. You were a light in the lofty backbones, a light in the darkness of the earth, a light in the air, and a light in the exalted heavens where you were a shining light which will not be extinguished. Verily you are the announcer of guidance. Then take a few steps, say “Allāhu Akbar” seven times, recite Tahlīl seven times, praise Allāh seven times, and sanctify Allāh seven times. Then answer the call of Ḥusain seven times by saying: I am at your service, O caller to Allāh!!! Then recite (the following): Even though my body could not answer your call for help and my tongue did not answer you when you asked for support, my heart, my ears, my eyes, my thoughts, and my desires have answered your call and have submitted to the remainder of the Prophet who was sent as a messenger, the chosen grandson, the knowledgeable guide, the entrusted guardian, the one who fulfilled (his duties) and announced the message (of Allāh), and the wronged and oppressed one. O my master! I have come solely to you, to your grandfather, to your father, and to your son who remains after you. My heart has submitted to you (the Imams ). I follow you in my views and my support is ready for you until Allāh judges based on His religion and (until He) resurrects you. I take Allāh as witness that you (the Imams ) are the Decisive Proofs and that Mercy can be hoped for only through you. I shall be with you and only with you, and not with your enemies. I am among those who believe in you. I do not deny the power of Allāh nor do I belie His Will. Then walk (toward the grave) and take small steps until you face the grave. Turn your back toward Qiblah, turn your face toward his face, and recite (the following): Salām to you from Allāh. And Salām upon Muḥammad, Allāh’s Trustee over His messengers and over His firmly determined affairs, the last of that which has passed and the one who began that which is yet to come, and the absolute master over all of it. And may Allāh’s Mercy and Blessings be upon him. Salām to you and (may) the greetings of Allāh be upon you. O Allāh! Send Your blessing on Muḥammad and the family of Muḥammad, the owner of Your covenant, the last of Your messengers, the master of Your slaves, Your Trustee in Your lands, and the best of Your creation. (O Allāh! Send Your blessing on him) just like he recited Your Book and fought Your enemies until that which is certain (death) came to him. O Allāh! Send Your blessing on the Commander of the Believers, Your slave, the brother of Your Messenger, the one whom You chose with Your knowledge and whom You appointed as a guide for whomever You willed from among Your creation, the guide to those whom You sent with Your messages, the undisputed ruler of religion with Your justice, the Decisive Judge between Your creation, and the absolute master over all of it. Salām to him and (may) Allāh’s Mercy and Blessings be upon him. O Allāh! Complete Your words with him, fulfill Your Promise through him, destroy Your enemies through him, and register us among his followers and those who love him. O Allāh! Make us among his Shia, supporters, and helpers based on Your obedience and the obedience of Your Messenger, and (make us among his supporters) in fulfilling that which You entrusted to him and the affairs over which you gave him authority, O Lord of the Worlds. O Allāh! Send Your blessing on Fāťimah, the daughter of Your Prophet, the wife of Your Walī, and the mother of the two grandsons (of the Prophet) – Ḥasan and Ḥusain, and the Pure, the Purified, the Most Truthful, the Righteous one, and the Master of All of the Women of Paradise – blessings which cannot be measured except by You. O Allāh! Send Your blessing on Ḥasan ibn ‘Ali, Your slave, the son of the brother of Your Messenger, the one whom You chose with Your knowledge and whom You appointed as a guide for whomever You willed from among Your creation, the guide to those whom You sent with Your messages, the undisputed ruler of religion with Your justice, the Decisive Judge between Your creation, and the absolute master over all of it. Salām to him and (may) Allāh’s Mercy and Blessings be upon him. O Allāh! Send Your blessing on Ḥusain ibn ‘Ali, Your slave, the son of the brother of Your Messenger, the one whom You chose with Your knowledge and whom You appointed as a guide for whomever You willed from among Your creation, the guide to those whom You sent with Your messages, the undisputed ruler of religion with Your justice, the Decisive Judge between Your creation, and the absolute master over all of it. Salām to him and (may) Allāh’s Mercy and Blessings be upon him. Then send blessings on (the rest of) the Imams in the same way that you sent blessings on Ḥasan and Ḥusain . Thereafter, recite (the following): O Allāh! Complete Your words with them, fulfill Your Promise through them, and destroy all of Your enemies and their enemies, from among the Jinn and mankind, through them. O Allāh! Reward them on our behalf with a reward which is better than any reward that You have ever given to a warner on behalf of his nation. O Allāh! Make us among their Shia, supporters, and helpers based on Your obedience and the obedience of Your Messenger. O Allāh! Make us among those who follow the light which was brought down with them. And make us live the way they lived and die the way they died and allow us to witness their sites in this world and in the Hereafter. O Allāh! You have honoured and dignified me by (allowing me to be in) this position and You have granted that which I longed for based on my genuine belief in You and in Your messengers. Then go closer to the grave and recite (the following): Salām to you, O son of the Messenger of Allāh. And Salām of Allāh, Salām of His High-Ranked angels, and His prophets who were sent as messengers be upon you along with the Purified greetings which reach you at all times. Salām of those whose hearts believe in you and whose tongues speak of your merits be upon you. I testify that you are truthful and veracious. You were truthful in that which you called (the people) to and you were truthful about that which you brought forth. And verily Allāh will avenge you on earth. O Allāh! Include me among (the followers of) Your Divinely Appointed Authorities. And make me love being martyred like them and witnessing their sites in this life and in the Hereafter. Verily You have power over all things. Then recite (the following): Salām to you, O Abā ‘Abdillāh. May Allāh’s Mercy be upon you, O Abā Abdillāh. May Allāh’s blessing be upon you, O Abā ‘Abdillāh. Salām to you, O Imam of Guidance. Salām to you, O Flag of Piety. Salām to you, O Allāh’s Decisive Proof on the people of the world. Salām to you, O Allāh’s Decisive Proof and O son of His Decisive Proof. Salām to you, O son of the Prophet of Allāh. Salām to you, O one whose avenger is Allāh and O son of the one whose avenger is Allāh. Salām to you, O Allāh’s Unavenged One and O son of Allāh’s Unavenged One. I testify that you were killed unjustly and that your killer is in Hell. I testify that you fought in the way of Allāh the way (in which) He should be fought for. You were not affected by the censure of any censurer and you worshipped Allāh until that which is certain (death) came to you. I testify that you (the Imams ) are the Words of Piety, Doors of Guidance, and the Decisive Proofs on Allāh’s creation. I testify that you have always had these (ranks) and they will remain (apparent) in you. I testify that your souls and your clay are (created) from a purified clay and they purified and blessed one another through Allāh and His Mercy. I take Allāh, the Blessed and the Exalted, as witness and He is sufficient as a witness, and I take you (the Imams ) as witnesses that I believe in you and I follow you in my affairs, in the rulings of my religion, in the end (result) of my deeds, and in my destination and abode (in the Hereafter). I ask Allāh, the Kind, the Merciful, to fulfill this for me. I testify that you (the Imams ) announced (the message of Allāh) and advised (the people). You remained patient, you were killed, your rights were usurped, and you were ill-treated but you remained patient. May Allāh’s curse be upon the nation who opposed you, upon the nation who denied your Wilāyah, upon the nation who supported one another against you, and upon the nation who witnessed (your martyrdom) but were not martyred (with you). Praise be to Allāh who made Hell their final destination. What a terrible abode Hell is and what a terrible punishment their chastisement is! Then recite (the following): May Allāh’s blessing be upon you, O Abā ‘Abdillāh. May Allāh’s blessing be upon you, O Abā ‘Abdillāh. May Allāh’s blessing be upon you, O Abā ‘Abdillāh and upon your soul and body. May Allāh’s curse be upon those who killed you. May Allāh’s curse be upon those who looted you. May Allāh’s curse be upon those who disappointed you. May Allāh’s curse be upon those who followed the orders of killing you, those who ordered (the people) to kill you, and those who participated in the spilling of your blood. May Allāh’s curse be upon those who heard about your killing and were pleased with it or made peace with it. I seek nearness to Allāh by dissociating myself from following them and I follow Allāh, His Messenger, and the family of His Messenger ﷺ. I testify that those who breached your sanctity and spilled your blood are cursed by the tongue of the Prophet of Makkah. O Allāh! Curse those who belied Your messengers and spilled the blood of the family of Your Prophet – may Your blessings be upon them. O Allāh! Curse the killers of the Commander of the Believers and multiply the painful chastisement on them. O Allāh! Curse the killers of Ḥusain ibn ‘Ali and the killers of the supporters of Ḥusain ibn ‘Ali. Burn them with Your blazing fires, make them taste Your Wrath, multiply the painful chastisement on them, and curse them with a severe curse. O Allāh! Make Your Wrath befall them, attack them where they do not expect, seize them while they are unaware, and punish them with an intense chastisement. (O Allāh!) Curse the enemies of Your Prophet and the enemies of the family of Your Prophet with a severe curse. O Allāh! Curse the Jibt and the Ťāghūt and the pharaohs. Verily You have power over all things. Then recite (the following): May I sacrifice my father and mother for you, O Abā ‘Abdillāh! I have traveled to you although my home is far, I have shed tears over you, and my sorrow, my lamentation, my screaming, my sighing, and my sobbing was over you. I came to you and I am using you to hide from my great sins. I have come to you as a Zā`ir and a guest whose back has become heavy (from the weight of his sins). May I sacrifice my father and mother for you, O my Master! I have cried over you, O best of Allāh’s Creation and the son of the best of Allāh’s Creation, and I should be crying over you since the heavens, the earths, the mountains, and the seas have cried over you. Therefore, what can be my excuse for not crying over you while the Love of my Lord (the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ) and the Imams have cried over you and everyone below Sidratul Muntahā (down) to the earth has cried impatiently over you?!!! Then touch the grave and recite (the following): Salām to you, O Abā ‘Abdillāh, O Ḥusain ibn ‘Ali, O son of the Messenger of Allāh. Salām to you, O Allāh’s Decisive Proof and son of His Decisive Proof. I testify that you are Allāh’s Slave and His Trustee. You announced (the message of Allāh) with loyalty and you fulfilled (your duties) faithfully. You said the truth, you were killed as the Most Truthful One, and you died as a martyr with certainty. You did not prefer blindness over guidance, you did not lean toward falsehood and away from Ḥaqq, and you did not answer anyone’s call except Allāh’s alone. I testify that you had insight into your Lord, you announced that which you were ordered to, and you fulfilled your obligations toward Him. You believed in the truth of those (appointed by Allāh) who preceded you without weakness or languor. May Allāh’s blessing and Salām be upon you."

You fought in the way of Allāh and were killed following the path of the Messenger of Allāh – may Allāh’s blessing and Salām be upon him and his family.

Do not make me preoccupied with this world such that I neglect thanking You for Your blessings. Do not give me too many (worldly blessings) such that I become fond of its wondering happiness and such that I become charmed by its shining decorations. Do not give me too little such that my good deeds are affected by working too hard for this world and such that I continuously worry about it. Give me enough so that I do not need the evil ones from Your creation and enough that I can attain Your pleasure, O Most Merciful of the merciful ones.

Abū ‘Abdil Raḥmān Muḥammad ibn Aḥmad ibn Ḥusain Al-‘Askari narrated to me in ‘Askar Mukram, from Ḥasan ibn ‘Ali ibn Mahziyār, from his father, from Muḥammad ibn Abī ‘Umayr, from Muḥammad ibn Marwān, from Abī Ḥamzah Al-Thumāli, who said: Abū ‘Abdillāh (Imam Sādiq ) said: When you decide to bid farewell after having performed the Ziyārah (of Ḥusain ), recite as many Ziyārah(s) as you can. Ensure that you choose Naynawā or Qāďiriyyah as your residence. Before bidding farewell, perform a Ghusl and perform the farewell Ziyārah. Once you have finished reciting the Ziyārah, turn your face towards his face, touch the grave, and recite (the following): Salām to you, O Walī of Allāh. Salām to you, O Abā ‘Abdillāh. You are my protection from the chastisement (of the Hereafter). This is the time for me to leave you although I am not abandoning you, I am not replacing you with anyone other than you, nor am I giving preference to anyone else above you. I have not lost the desire to be near you. I have put myself in danger (by traveling to you) and have left my family and homeland (to come to you). Therefore, be there for me on the day of my need, poverty, and indigence; the day when my parents, my children, my intimate friends, my companions, and my relatives will not help me. I ask Allāh, who willed and created, to remove my anguish through you and I ask Allāh, who willed for me to be parted from your site, not to make this the last time I come (to your Ziyārah) and to allow me to return. I ask Allāh, who made my eyes cry over you, to make this crying my support (on the Day of Judgment). And I ask Allāh, who made me travel to you from my home and family, to keep this Ziyārah reserved for me. I ask Allāh, who showed me your place and guided me to say Salām to you and to perform your Ziyārah, to allow me to come to your Pool and to sustain me with accompanying you in the Heavens along with your Righteous Fathers – may Allāh’s blessing be upon all of them. Salām to you, O Allāh’s Chosen One and son of His Chosen One. Salām upon the Messenger of Allāh, Muḥammad ibn ‘Abdillāh, Allāh’s Love and His Chosen One, His Trustee and His Messenger, and the Master of the Prophets. Salām upon the Commander of the Believers, the Successor of the Messenger of the Lord of the Worlds and the Leader of those with Shining Faces (on the Day of Judgment). Salām upon the Righteous and Rightly Guided Imams. Salām to those of you (Imams) who are in the Ḥā`ir and (may) Allāh’s Mercy and Blessings be upon you. Salām upon Allāh’s Angels who remain here sanctifying (Allāh) and who are residents (in the Ḥā`ir), the angels who fulfill the orders of their Lord. Salām upon us and upon Allāh’s Righteous Slaves and praise is due to Allāh, the Lord of the Worlds. Then recite (the following): Salām of Allāh and Salām of His High-Ranked Angels, His prophets who were sent as messengers, and His Righteous Slaves be upon you, O son of the Messenger of Allāh, and upon your soul, your body, your progeny, and upon those of your friends who were with you. . I bid farewell to you and leave you in the care of Allāh and I send my Salām to you. We believe in Allāh, in His Messenger, and in the message which he brought from Allāh. O Allāh! Register us among those who testify. Then recite (the following): O Allāh! Send Your blessing on Muḥammad and the family of Muḥammad and do not make this the last time I come to the Ziyārah of the son of Your Messenger. Sustain me with (coming to) his Ziyārah (repeatedly) for as long as You keep me alive. O Allāh! Make me benefit from his love, O Lord of the Worlds. O Allāh! Resurrect him in a Praised Position. Verily You have power over all things. O Allāh! After having established prayers and having said Salām (to them), I ask You to send Your blessing on Muḥammad and the family of Muḥammad and I ask You not to make this the last time I come to his Ziyārah. O Lord! If You do make it (my last Ziyārah), then resurrect me with him, with his fathers, and his (true) followers. And if You keep me alive, then sustain me with coming to his Ziyārah again and again with Your Mercy, O Most Merciful of the merciful ones. O Allāh! Appoint for me a truthful tongue with Your Divine Authorities and make me love their sites. O Allāh! Send Your blessing on Muḥammad and the family of Muḥammad and do not make me preoccupied with too many blessings of this world such that I neglect Your remembrance. Do not give me too many (worldly blessings) such that I become fond of its wondering happiness and such that I become charmed by its shining decorations. (Also) do not give me too little such that my good deeds are affected by working too hard for this world and such that I continuously worry about it. Give me enough so that I do not need the evil ones from Your creation and enough that I can attain Your pleasure, O Most Merciful. Salām to you, O Allāh’s Angels and the Zuwwār of the grave of Abī ‘Abdillāh . Then place your right and left cheek on the grave and insist on praying and asking for your needs. Do not turn your back to the grave while leaving until you exit (the Ḥā`ir)."

I testify that you submitted and believed and that you devoted yourself and remained loyal to the Remainder of the Prophet who was sent as a messenger (Imam Ḥusain ), the Chosen Grandson, the Knowledgeable Guide, the Successor who announced (the message of Allāh), and the one who was oppressed and wronged. May Allāh reward you on behalf of His Messenger, the Commander of the Believers, Ḥasan, and Ḥusain – may Allāh’s blessings be upon them – with the best of rewards, for you suffered (in this world) but remained patient expecting the reward from Allāh. So how excellent is (your) final abode!! May Allāh’s curse be upon those who killed you. May Allāh’s curse be upon those who ignored your rights and breeched your sanctity. May Allāh’s curse be upon those who stood between you and the water of the Euphrates (River). I testify that you were killed unjustly and verily Allāh will fulfill that which He promised you. I have come to you, O son of the Commander of the Believers, as your guest while my heart has submitted to you. I follow you and my support is prepared for you until Allāh judges and He is the Best of Judges. I am with you and only with you and not with your enemies. I believe in you and in your return and I disbelieve in those who opposed you and killed you. May Allāh kill the nation who killed you with their hands and tongues. Then enter, fall on to the grave, and recite (the following): Salām to you, O (Allāh’s) Righteous Slave who was obedient to Allāh, to His Messenger, to the Commander of the Believers, and to Ḥasan and Ḥusain . Salām to you and may Allāh’s Mercy, Blessings, and Pleasure be upon you, your soul, and your body. I testify and take Allāh as witness that you died on the same path as the martyrs in the Battle of Badr who fought in the way of Allāh, that you remained loyal to Him in fighting against His enemies, that you strived hard in supporting His Divine Authorities, and that you kept harm away from His Loved Ones. May Allāh reward you with the best of rewards, the greatest rewards, the most increasing rewards, and with rewards which are above any reward (which He has ever) granted to those who remained loyal to their allegiance, who answered His call, and who obeyed His Divine Authorities. I testify that you strived hard with loyalty and put forth all of your efforts (in the way of Allāh). Therefore, Allāh resurrected you among the Martyrs, joined your soul with the souls of the Ever-Blissful Ones, and gave you the most spacious place in His Heavens and the best of its chambers (as your abode). And He elevated your remembrance in the highest of places and raised you with “the prophets, the Truthful Ones, the Martyrs, and the Righteous Ones, and excellent are these companions” (4:69). I testify that you were not weakened and you did not lose heart (while facing the enemies). Verily you died with insight about your affairs while following the Righteous Ones and the prophets. May Allāh unite us with you, with His Messenger, and His Divine Authorities in the dwellings of the Humble Ones. Verily He is the Most Merciful of the merciful ones."

Resurrect me with him and with his fathers in the Heavens. O Allāh! Acquaint me with him, with Your Messenger, and with Your Divine Authorities. O Allāh! Send Your blessing on Muḥammad and the family of Muḥammad and make me die while believing in you, believing in Your Messenger, believing in the Wilāyah of ‘Ali ibn Abī Ťālib and the Imams from his sons , and while dissociating from their enemies.

My father, ‘Ali ibn Ḥusain and all of my scholars narrated to me from Sa’d ibn ‘Abdillāh ibn Abī Khalaf, from Aḥmad ibn Muḥammad ibn ‘Isā, from Muḥammad ibn Sinān, from Abī Sa’īd Al-Qammāť, from ‘Abdillāh ibn Abī Ya’fūr, who said: I heard Abā ‘Abdillāh (Imam Sādiq ) ask one of his followers, “Do you go to the Ziyārah of the grave of Abī ‘Abdillāh, Ḥusain ibn ‘Ali ?” The man replied, “Yes, I go to his Ziyārah once every two or three years.” Imam became angry and said, “I swear to Allāh, whom there is no god but He, that if you go to his Ziyārah (more frequently) you will be in a better state than you are presently.” The man asked, “May I sacrifice myself for you! Is it this valuable?” Imam replied: Yes, I swear to Allāh. If I told you about the merits of his Ziyārah and his grave, you would completely abandon going to Hajj and none of you (Shia) would ever perform Hajj. Woe unto you! Do you not know that Allāh chose Karbalā because of his grave as a safe and blessed Ḥaram before He chose Makkah as a Ḥaram? I (Ibn Abī Ya’fūr) said, “Allāh has made the performance of Hajj obligatory on the people but he has not mentioned the Ziyārah of the grave of Ḥusain (in Qur’an).” Imam replied: Even so. Verily this is a matter that Allāh has chosen in this (specific) way. Have you not heard the words of my father, the Commander of the Believers , who said, “It is more appropriate to wipe the bottom of the foot (in Wuďū) than the top, but Allāh has made the latter (wiping the top) obligatory on His slaves.” Do you not think that it would have been better if ‘Arafāt were inside the Ḥaram because of its honour?! But Allāh has chosen it to be elsewhere."

I swear to My Glory and My Magnificence that your honour compared to the honour which I have granted to the land of Karbalā is like the amount of (a drop of) water on a needle that has been dipped in the sea. If it was not for the dust of Karbalā, I would not have honoured you. If it was not for that which is held within the land of Karbalā, I would not have created you nor would I have created the house about which you boasted. Therefore, settle down, calm down, and become humbled, lowly, humiliated, disgraced, and degraded in front of the land of Karbalā. Do not be proud nor arrogant in front of it or I will make you sink and throw you in the fires of Hell. The above Ḥadīth has also been narrated to me through the following chain: My father and ‘Ali ibn Ḥusain, from ‘Ali ibn Ibrāhīm ibn Hāshim, from his father, from Muḥammad ibn ‘Ali, from Abī Sa’īd ‘Abbād Al-‘Usfuri, from ‘Umar ibn Yazīd Bayyā’ Al-Sāburi, from Ja’far ibn Muḥammad (Imam Sādiq )."

Some of these lands and waters boasted to others and some of them transgressed and they have all been punished for not being humble before Allāh. Therefore, Allāh empowered the polytheists over (the land of the) Ka’bah and made the water of Zamzam salty which has ruined its taste. Verily the land of Karbalā and the water of the Euphrates (River) were the first land and (body of) water which glorified Allāh, the Blessed and the Exalted. Therefore, Allāh blessed them and said to the land of Karbalā, “Speak of that with which Allāh, the Exalted, has honoured you, for verily the lands and the waters have boasted to one another.” The land of Karbalā said: I am the sacred and blessed land of Allāh. The (power to) cure has been placed in my dust and in my water, and I am not arrogant. Rather, I am humble and humiliated before He who has blessed me. I do not boast to those who are lower (in rank) than me. Rather, I am thankful to Allāh. Therefore, Allāh honoured it, increased His blessing on it for its humility, and rewarded it with Ḥusain and his companions. Then Abū ‘Abdillāh added, “Allāh elevates those who humble themselves before Him. And Allāh, the Exalted, degrades those who are arrogant.”"

My father and Muḥammad ibn Ḥasan both narrated to me from Ḥasan ibn Mattīl, from Sahl ibn Ziyād, from Abī Hāshim Al-Ja’fari, who said: When Abul Ḥasan (Imam Hādi ) was ill, he sent for Muḥammad ibn Ḥamzah and I. Muḥammad ibn Ḥamzah arrived there before I did and told me that the Imam kept saying, “Send someone (on my behalf) to the Ḥā`ir. Send someone (on my behalf) to the Ḥā`ir.” I said to Muḥammad ibn Ḥamzah, “Why did you not say that you would go to the Ḥā`ir (on his behalf)?!” Then I went to the Imam and said, “May I sacrifice myself for you! I will go to the Ḥā`ir.” Imam replied, “Plan it carefully, for Muḥammad cannot keep this matter hidden from Zayd ibn ‘Ali and I do not want him to find out about this.” I mentioned this to ‘Ali ibn Bilāl and he asked, “Why does the Imam want to send someone to the Ḥā`ir while he is (as sacred as) the Ḥā`ir?!” I went back to ‘Askar (Sāmarrā) and went to visit the Imam . When I was about to leave, the Imam asked me to stay. Once I felt comfortable, I mentioned that which ‘Ali ibn Bilāl had said. Therefore, the Imam said: Why did you not reply to him by saying that the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ used to circulate the Ka’bah and kiss the Ḥajar (Al-Aswad) even though the sanctity of the Prophet ﷺ and even a believer is greater than the sanctity of the House (of Allāh)?! (Moreover), Allāh ordered him (the Prophet ﷺ) to go to ‘Arafāt and stay in it (while he is more sacred than ‘Arafāt). (This is because) these are places in which Allāh loves to be called upon. And I love to have someone pray for me in a place where Allāh loves to be called upon, and the Ḥā`ir is one of these places."

Send a man from among our followers to the Ḥā`ir to pray for me (to be cured).” When I left the Imam , I met ‘Ali ibn Bilāl and I informed him of the Imam’s order and asked him to be the one to go to the Ḥā`ir. He replied, “I am at his command. However, the Imam is more sacred than the Ḥā`ir because he has the same rank as the one in the Ḥā`ir and it is more effective if he prays for himself than if I pray for him in the Ḥā`ir.” I informed the Imam about that which ‘Ali ibn Bilāl had said. The Imam said to me: Tell him that the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ is more sacred than the House (of Allāh) and the Ḥajar but he used to circulate the House (of Allāh) and touch the Ḥajar. Verily, there are places in which Allāh, the Exalted, loves to be called upon and He answers the call of those who call upon Him (in those places), and the Ḥā`ir is one of those places."

Muḥammad ibn ‘Abdillāh ibn Ja’far Al-Ḥimyari narrated to me from his father, from ‘Ali ibn Muḥammad ibn Sālim, from Muḥammad ibn Khālid, from ‘Abdillāh ibn Ḥammād Al-Basri, from ‘Abdillāh ibn ‘Abdil Raḥmān Al-Asam, from Mudlij, from Muḥammad ibn Muslim, who said: Once I went to Madīnah while I was ill and people informed him (Imam Bāqir ) that I was ill. Abū Ja’far (Imam Bāqir ) sent a boy to me who was carrying a drink which was covered with a handkerchief. The boy gave me the drink and said, “Drink it (now). He (the Imam ) has ordered me not to return until you drink it.” So I drank it (immediately). It smelled like musk and it was cold and tasty. After I finished drinking it, the boy said to me, “Your master has ordered you to go and meet him as soon as you finish your drink.” I thought about what he said and (the fact that) I could not even stand on my legs before (drinking) this drink. However, as soon as the drink entered my body, I was energized and my cramp was relieved. I went to the Imam and asked for permission to enter. Imam raised his voice and said, “O healthy one! Enter.” I entered, crying. I said Salām to him and kissed his hand and head. Imam asked, “O Muḥammad! Why are you crying?” I replied, “May I sacrifice myself for you! I cry for the loneliness of living so far from you and for not having the ability to live next to you so that I can look at you.” Imam said: As for the lack of ability, this is what Allāh has willed for our friends and those who love us. And the afflictions befall them quickly (in this life). As for the loneliness, verily the believers are lonely in this life among this deviated creation until they leave this life (going) toward the Mercy of Allāh. As for living so far from us, you should console yourself with (remembering) Abī ‘Abdillāh (Imam Ḥusain ) who is in a land next to the Euphrates (River) so far from us. As for that which you mentioned about your love for being close to us and looking at us but not being able to do so, verily Allāh knows that which is in your heart and He will reward you accordingly. Then the Imam asked, “Do you go to the grave of Ḥusain ?” I replied, “Yes, but in (the state of) fear and apprehension.” Imam said: The more dangerous it becomes, the greater the reward will be, equal to the amount of fear. Those who go to the grave of Ḥusain in fear will return while they are forgiven. The angels say Salām to them, the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ will see them and see their actions and will pray for them, and Allāh will make them feel safe on the Day when people will be raised for the Lord of the Worlds. “They returned, therefore with grace and favour from Allāh and no harm touched them, and they followed the pleasure of Allāh” (3:174). Then the Imam asked me, “How did you find the drink?” I replied: I testify that you are the family of mercy and you are the successor of the successors. When the boy brought that which you had sent, I could not even stand on my legs and I had given up on myself. After he gave me the drink and I drank it, I felt that I had never smelled (a drink) like this and I had never tasted a colder and a more tasty drink than this. After I finished drinking it, the boy said to me, “The Imam ordered me to tell you to go and meet him as soon as you finish your drink.” I knew how poor my condition was but I thought to myself that I would come to you even if this causes my death. However, as soon as I started coming toward you, I felt energized and my cramp was relieved. So praise be to Allāh who has made you the Mercy for your Shia and for me. Imam said: O Muḥammad! The drink from which you drank contained some of the clay of the grave of Ḥusain and it is the best of cures. Therefore, do not replace it with anything else, for verily we give this drink to our children and women and we find all of the blessings in it. I asked, “May I sacrifice myself for you! Should we take some of this clay (as well) and cure ourselves with it?” Imam replied: People (often) take from this clay and bring it out of the Ḥā`ir while it is visible. However, when they pass by any jinn or animal who is ill or pass by anything else which is diseased, it smells the clay. Therefore, its blessing disappears and others benefit from it. But the clay that we use as a cure is not like this. If it was not for that which I mentioned, everyone who touched the clay of the grave of Ḥusain or drank from the water which contains it would have been cured immediately. It is exactly like Ḥajar Al-Aswad: the ill ones, the disbelievers, and the pagans kept touching it and being cured by it. It was as white as the whitest corundum but (through time) it became black, as you (now) see. I asked, “May I sacrifice myself for you! What is wrong with the way I take it?” Imam replied, “You show it to others and you do what others do. You dishonour it by placing it in your saddlebag or in things which will tarnish it. Therefore, it will lose the effect that you seek from it.” I said, “May I sacrifice myself for you! You are right.” Imam said, “Everyone who takes from the clay of the grave of Ḥusain does not know how it should be taken. Therefore, it does not remain intact in the hands of the people.” I asked, “May I sacrifice myself for you! How can I take from it the way you do?” Imam replied, “Do you want me to give you some of it?” I said, “Yes.” Imam asked, “What will you do with it?” I replied, “I will take it with me.” Imam asked, “Where will you place it?” I replied, “In my clothes.” Imam said, “Then you are going back to what you used to do. Drink from the water which contains the clay here and do not carry it with you because it will not remain intact with you.” Thereafter, the Imam gave me from that drink twice and I found no sign of that illness from which I was suffering, and then I left."

Muḥammad ibn Ḥasan ibn ‘Ali ibn Mahziyār narrated to me from his grandfather ‘Ali ibn Mahziyār, from Ḥasan ibn Sa’īd, from ‘Abdillāh ibn ‘Abdil Raḥmān Al-Asam, from Abī ‘Amr – a scholar from Kūfah, from Abī Ḥamzah Al-Thumāli, who said: I was in Makkah when I said to Abī ‘Abdillāh (Imam Sādiq ), “May I sacrifice myself for you! I have seen some of our companions take some of the clay of the Ḥā`ir and seek cure with it. Does it contain any cure like they say it does?” Imam replied: It can be used as a cure even if it is collected from the distance of four miles away from the Grave (of Ḥusain ). The same applies to the grave of my grandfather, the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ, and the same applies to the clay of the graves of Ḥasan , ‘Ali (Imam Sajjād ), and Muḥammad (Imam Bāqir ). Take some of it (the clay of the grave of Ḥusain ), for verily it is a cure for every disease and a shield against any fearful matter. Nothing else from among that which is used to cure (an ailment) can be compared to it except supplication. However, the containers in which it is (often) kept and the lack of certainty of those who treat themselves with it spoils it. Those who are certain that if they treat themselves with it, they will be cured, (will find that) it will suffice them with the permission of Allāh from having to use any other medicine. The devils and the disbeliever Jinns also spoil it by rubbing themselves against it. Nothing passes by it without smelling it. As for the devils and the disbeliever Jinns, they envy humans because of it so they rub themselves against it and all of its fragrance vanishes. An innumerable number from among them (the devils and the disbeliever Jinns) prepare themselves as soon as the clay leaves the Ḥā`ir – for they cannot enter the Ḥā`ir because of the angels (who guard it) – and they rub themselves against the clay while it is in the hands of the person who is carrying it. If any part of this dust remained intact and was used to treat any patient, he would be cured immediately. So when you take from this clay, keep it hidden and mention Allāh, the Exalted, increasingly on it. I have been informed that some of the people who take from the dust belittle it so much that some of them even place it in the feedbag of their camels, mules and donkeys, or in their own food containers, or in the handkerchiefs which are used to wipe the hands after eating, or in their saddlebags!!! How can a person who dishonours it in this way seek cure with it?!!! (Verily) the uncertain hearts of those who belittle that which leads to their righteousness will ruin its effect."

Ja’far ibn Muḥammad ibn Ibrāhīm Al-Mūsawi narrated to me from ‘Abdillāh ibn Nahīk, from Sa’d ibn Sāliḥ, from Ḥasan ibn ‘Ali ibn Abī Mughīrah, from one of our companions, who said: I said to Abī ‘Abdillāh (Imam Sādiq ), “I am a man with many illnesses and diseases and there is not any medicine that I have not tried.” Imam said: Why have you not used the dust (from the grave) of Ḥusain ?! Verily it contains the cure for every disease and it is protection against any fear. When you take from it you should say: O Allāh! I ask You through the right of this clay, through the right of the angel who took from it, through the right of the Prophet who held it, and through the right of the Successor who is lying in it to send Your blessing on Muḥammad and his family and to make it my cure against every disease and my protection against any fear. Then Imam added: The angel who took from it was Jabra`īl who showed it to the Prophet ﷺ and said, “This is the dust of this son of yours. Your nation will kill him after you.” The prophet who held it was Muḥammad ﷺ and the successor who is lying in it is Ḥusain ibn ‘Ali , the Master of the Martyrs. I said, “I understand that it is a cure for every disease but how is it a protection against any fear?” Imam replied: If you fear a ruler or anything similar to that, do not leave your house without carrying some of the clay of the grave of Ḥusain . When you take from it, you should say: O Allāh! This is the clay of the grave of Ḥusain, Your Walī and the son of Your Walī, and I have carried it as protection against that which I fear and that which I do not. Imam added, “Verily it is possible that a tragedy which you do not fear might befall you.” So I took it as he had ordered and I swear to Allāh that I became healthy. It was also my protection against that which I feared and against that which I did not fear, just as the Imam had said. Praise be to Allāh that I have not seen any misfortune ever since."

Muḥammad ibn ‘Abdillāh ibn Ja’far Al-Ḥimyari narrated to me from his father, from Aḥmad ibn Abī ‘Abdillāh Al-Barqi, from his father, who narrated that: Ḥanān ibn Sadīr Al-Sayrafi went to (visit) Abā ‘Abdillāh (Imam Sādiq ) when a group of his companions were with him. Imam asked him, “O Ḥanān ibn Sadīr! Do you perform the Ziyārah of Abī ‘Abdillāh (Imam Ḥusain ) once every month?” Ḥanān replied, “No.” Imam asked, “What about once every two months?” Ḥanān replied, “No.” Imam asked, “What about once a year?” Ḥanān replied, “No.” Imam said, “How negligent you people are toward your master!!!” Ḥanān said, “O son of the Messenger of Allāh! It is because of lack of wealth and the greatness of the distance.” Imam said, “Should I not teach you an accepted Ziyārah even from a great distance?!” Ḥanān asked, “How should I perform his Ziyārah, O son of the Messenger of Allāh?” Imam replied: Perform a Ghusl on a Friday or any other day you wish, wear the most purified of your clothes, ascend to the highest place in your house or in a desert, and then face the Qiblah after ensuring that the grave is also in the same direction, for Allāh, the Blessed and the Exalted, says, “Wherever you turn, there is the face of Allāh” (2:115). Then say: Salām to you, O my master and the son of my master and O my leader and the son of my leader. Salām to you, O my master, the Martyr and son of the Martyr, the Slain (One) and the son of the Slain (One). Salām to you and (may) Allāh’s Mercy and Blessings be upon you. I am performing your Ziyārah, O son of the Messenger of Allāh with my heart, my tongue, and my organs although I have not come to your Ziyārah physically where I can see your dome. Salām to you, O heir of Ādam, the Chosen Slave of Allāh; And O heir of Nūḥ, the Prophet of Allāh; And O heir of Ibrāhīm, the Friend of Allāh; And O heir of Mūsā, the One Addressed by Allāh; And O heir of ‘Isā, the Spirit of Allāh; And O heir of Muḥammad, the Love, the Prophet, and the Messenger of Allāh; And O heir of ‘Ali, the Commander of the Believers, the Successor of the Messenger of Allāh and his Caliph; And O heir of Ḥasan ibn ‘Ali, the Successor of the Commander of the Believers. May Allāh’s curse be upon those who killed you and may He renew their torment in this hour and in every hour. O my master! I seek nearness to Allāh, the Great and Almighty, and to your grandfather, the Messenger of Allāh, and to your father, the Commander of the Believers, and to your brother, Ḥasan, and to you, O my leader, through performing your Ziyārah with my heart, my tongue, and all of my organs. Salām to you and (may) Allāh’s Mercy and Blessings be upon you. O my master! Intercede on my behalf so that this Ziyārah is accepted from me. I seek nearness to Allāh and to all of you by dissociating myself from your enemies and by cursing them. May Allāh’s blessings, His Pleasure, and His Mercy be upon you. Then move a short distance to the left and turn your face toward the grave of ‘Ali ibn Ḥusain , who is (buried) next to the feet of his father, and say Salām to him in the same way. Thereafter, ask Allāh for that which you want with regards to the matters of your religion and your life and then establish four Rak’ah of prayers. Verily the prayers of the Ziyārah can be established in either eight, six, four, or two Rak’ah, and the best is eight Rak’ah. After the prayers face the grave of Abī ‘Abdillāh (Imam Ḥusain ) and say: I bid farewell to you, O my master and the son of my master and O my leader and the son of my leader. And I bid farewell to you, O my master and the son of my master, O ‘Ali ibn Ḥusain. And I bid farewell to you, O my masters, O crowd of Martyrs. May Allāh’s Salām, His Mercy, His Pleasure, and His Blessings be upon you."

I have heard that some of our Shia allow one or two years to pass without going to the Ziyārah of Ḥusain !” I replied, “May I sacrifice myself for you! I know many people who are like this.” Imam said, “I swear to Allāh that they have turned their backs to their own fortune, they have declined Allāh’s rewards, and they have distanced themselves from nearness to Muḥammad ﷺ.” I asked, “May I sacrifice myself for you! How often should one go to his Ziyārah?” Imam replied, “O ‘Ali! If you can go to his Ziyārah once every month, do so.” I said, “I cannot do that because I am a manual labourer; people’s affairs are pending in my hands and I cannot be absent from my work for even one day.” Imam replied: You are excused, as are other manual labourers. I was referring to people other than manual labourers, people who have the possibility of going (to the Ziyārah) every week. Such people will have no excuse in front of Allāh and His Messenger ﷺ on the Day of Judgment (if they do not go to the Ziyārah of Ḥusain ). I asked, “Is it permissible for them to send someone on their behalf?” Imam replied: Yes. However, it is better for them and they will have a greater reward with their Lord if they go themselves, for He will see them sleepless at night and tired during the day (traveling to Ḥusain ). Allāh will look at them with a glance which will inevitably cause them to dwell with Muḥammad ﷺ and his family in the greatest places of Firdaws. Therefore, compete with one another in going (to the Ziyārah of Ḥusain ) and be among those who adhere to it."

Muḥammad ibn ‘Abdillāh ibn Ja’far Al-Ḥimyari narrated to me from his father, from ‘Ali ibn Muḥammad ibn Sālim, from Muḥammad ibn Khālid, from ‘Abdillāh ibn Ḥammād Al-Basri, from ‘Abdillāh ibn ‘Abdil Raḥmān Al-Asam, from Safwān Al-Jammāl, who said: I asked Abā ‘Abdillāh (Imam Sādiq ) on the route from Madīnah to Makkah, “O son of the Messenger of Allāh! Why do I see you so depressed, saddened, and grieved?” Imam replied, “If you could hear what I hear, you would have been distracted from asking me this question.” I asked, “What do you hear?” Imam replied: (I hear) the voices of the angels beseeching Allāh to curse the killers of the Commander of the Believers and the killers of Ḥusain . And (I hear) the voice of lamentation of the Jinn on them (the Commander of the Believers and Ḥusain ) and the intense grief and weeping of the angels who are around them. So who can enjoy food, drink, or sleep after hearing these voices?! I asked, “After one returns from the Ziyārah of Ḥusain , how soon should he return to his Ziyārah? And how often should one go to his Ziyārah? And what is the longest time one is allowed to stay away from his Ziyārah?” Imam replied: Those who live close to his grave, should not go to his Ziyārah less than once a month. However, those who live far from him, should perform it (the Ziyārah of Ḥusain ) (at least) once every three years. If three years pass and they do not go to his Ziyārah, they are (considered) ungrateful to the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ and they have disowned him, except those who have a (valid) excuse. If the Zā`ir of Ḥusain knew how happy he made the Messenger of Allāh, the Commander of the Believers, Fāťimah, the Imams , and the martyrs among our family, and how they pray for him, and the rewards which are prepared for him in this life and the rewards which have been preserved for him with Allāh in the Hereafter, he would have wished that his house was next to the grave of Ḥusain for as long as he lived. Verily when the Zā`ir leaves his dwelling (in Karbalā to return after the Ziyārah), his shadow does not cover anything without it praying for him. And when the sun shines (down) on him, it burns his sins just like fire burns firewood. The sun will not allow any of his sins to remain. Therefore, he will return without any sins while his rank has been elevated for him to a level which cannot be achieved even by those who are ensanguined with their own blood in the way of Allāh. Then an angel will be dedicated to him who will replace him (in performing the Ziyārah of Ḥusain ) and who will seek forgiveness for him until he returns to the Ziyārah or until three years pass or until he dies (if he dies within the three year period). The above Ḥadīth has also been narrated to me through the following chain: My father, from Aḥmad ibn Idrīs, and from Muḥammad ibn Yaḥyā, from ‘Amraki ibn ‘Ali Al-Būfaki, from Yaḥyā – who was the servant of Abī Ja’far the Second (Imam Jawād ), from ‘Ali, from Safwān ibn Mihrān Al-Jammāl from Abī ‘Abdillāh ."

Muḥammad ibn Ja’far Al-Razzāz Al-Kūfi narrated to me from Muḥammad ibn ‘Isā ibn ‘Ubayd, from someone whose name he mentioned, who said: Abul Ḥasan (Imam Hādi ) said: Recite the following in Baghdad: Salām to you, O Walī of Allāh. Salām to you, O Allāh’s Decisive Proof. Salām to you, O Allāh’s light in the darkness of the earth. Salām to you, O one about whom Allāh modified His Will. I have come to you while I believe in your rights and I am the enemy of your enemies. Therefore, intercede for me with your Lord, O my master. Then supplicate to Allāh and ask for your needs. Thereafter, recite the same Salām in the Ziyārah of Abī Ja’far, Muḥammad ibn ‘Ali (Imam Jawād ).He (Imam Hādi ) said: When you want to go to the Ziyārah of Musā ibn Ja’far (Imam Kāżim ) and Muḥammad ibn ‘Ali (Imam Jawād ), cleanse yourself, perform Ghusl, wear your purified clothes, and then go the graves of Abil Ḥasan, Mūsā ibn Ja’far and Muḥammad ibn ‘Ali ibn Mūsā Al-Riďā . When you arrive at the grave of Mūsā ibn Ja’far say: Salām to you, O Walī of Allāh. Salām to you, O Allāh’s Decisive Proof. Salām to you, O Allāh’s light in the darkness of the earth. Salām to you, O one about whom Allāh modified His will. I have come to you to perform your Ziyārah while I believe in your rights, I am the enemy of your enemies, and I befriend your friends. Therefore, intercede for me with your Lord, O my master. Then ask for your needs. Say Salām to Abī Ja’far, Muḥammad ibn ‘Ali Al-Jawād , ensuring that Ghusl has been performed, by saying: O Allāh! Send Your blessing on Muḥammad ibn ‘Ali, the righteous, the pious, the pure Imam, who is pleased with You and with whom You are pleased, and Your Decisive Proof on those who are on the earths and those under the dust. (O Allāh! Send) an increasing, complete, purified, beautified, continuous, and a frequent blessing (on him) that is consecutive and greater than any of the blessings You have sent on any of Your friends. Salām to you, O Walī of Allāh. Salām to you, O light of Allāh. Salām to you, O Allāh’s Decisive Proof. Salām to you, O Imam of the believers and heir of the prophets. Salām to you, O Caliph of the prophets and O progeny of the successors. Salām to you, O Allāh’s light in the darkness of the earth. I have come to you to perform your Ziyārah while I believe in your rights, I am the enemy of your enemies, and I befriend your friends. Therefore, intercede for me with your Lord, O my master. Then ask for your needs, for verily, Allāh-Willing, they will be fulfilled.Imam said: Recite the following next to the grave of Abil Ḥasan (Imam Kāżim ) in Baghdad – and you can recite the same in all of the sites (of the infallibles ): Salām upon Allāh’s Divine Authorities and His Chosen Ones. Salām upon Allāh’s Loved Ones and His Trustees. Salām upon Allāh’s Supporters and His Caliphs. Salām upon the places in which Allāh can be known. Salām upon the houses in which Allāh is extolled. Salām upon those who manifest Allāh’s orders and His prohibitions. Salām upon the Ones who call (the people) toward Allāh. Salām upon the Ones who are settled firmly in that which pleases Allāh. Salām upon the Ones who are loyal in obeying Allāh. Salām upon the guides to Allāh. Salām upon the Ones whom those who follow them have followed Allāh, those who antagonize them have antagonized Allāh, those who know them have known Allāh, those who ignore them have ignored Allāh, those who seek refuge with them have sought refuge with Allāh, and those who abandon them have abandoned Allāh. I take Allāh as witness that I have submitted to you, I make peace with those who make peace with you, I antagonize those who antagonize you, I believe in that which is secret about you and that which is apparent about you, and I rely on you in all of this. May Allāh’s curse be upon the enemies of the family of Muḥammad from among the Jinn and mankind and I seek nearness to Allāh by dissociating myself from them. And may Allāh’s blessing be upon Muḥammad and his family. Imam added: This Ziyārah will suffice in all of the sites (of the infallibles ). And (after reciting it), send blessings on Muḥammad ﷺ and his family increasingly and name them one after the other and dissociate from their enemies. Then choose some supplications and pray for yourself and the believers from among the men and the women."

It is narrated from one of them (the Holy Infallibles ), who said: When you (decide to) go to the grave of ‘Ali ibn Mūsā Al-Riďā in Ťūs, perform a Ghusl before leaving your house and recite the following while performing the Ghusl: O Allāh! Purify me and purify my heart, expand my chest, and make my tongue glorify and sanctify You. Verily there is no power except with You. O Allāh! Make this (Ghusl) a purification for me and make it my cure and my light. At the time of leaving (your house) recite (the following): ﷺ (I am going) in the name of Allāh, by Allāh, to Allāh, and to the son of His Messenger ﷺ. Allāh is sufficient for me and I rely on Allāh. O Allāh! I have turned to You, I am coming toward You, and I am seeking that which is with You. After you leave your house, stand next to the door and recite (the following): O Allāh! I have turned my face toward You and I have left my family, my wealth, and that which You have given me in Your protection. I have placed my trust in You so do not disappoint me. O One who those who seek Him are never disappointed and those who are protected by Him will never be lost! Send Your blessing on Muḥammad and the family of Muḥammad and protect me with Your protection, for verily those who are protected by You will never be lost. And once you arrive (in Ťūs) safely – Allāh-Willing – perform (another) Ghusl and recite the following during the Ghusl: O Allāh! Purify me and purify my heart. Expand my chest and allow my tongue to sanctify You, glorify You, and speak of Your love. Verily there is no power except with You. I have surely understood that the foundation of my religion is submitting to Your orders, following the traditions of Your Prophet, and testifying that You are the Creator of all of the creation. O Allāh! Make this (Ghusl) my cure and my light. Verily You have power over all things. Then wear your most purified clothes. Walk (toward the grave) barefoot with reverence and calmness while you recite Takbīr, Tahlīl, Tasbīḥ, TAḤMǏD, and TAMJǏD. Take short steps and recite (the following) while you enter (the Ḥaram): (I enter) in the name of Allāh, by Allāh, and while I am in the nation of the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ. I testify that there is no god but Allāh, He is alone and He has no partners. And I testify that Muḥammad ﷺ is His slave and His Messenger. And (I testify) that ‘Ali is the Walī of Allāh. Then point toward his grave and stand with your back toward Qiblah, facing his face, and recite (the following): I testify that there is no god but Allāh; He is alone and He has no partners. And I testify that Muḥammad ﷺ is His slave and His Messenger, that he is the master of the first and the last, and that he is the master of the prophets and the messengers. O Allāh! Send Your blessing on Muḥammad, Your slave, Your Messenger, Your Prophet, and the master of all of Your creation – blessings which cannot be measured except by You. O Allāh! Send Your blessing on the Commander of the Believers, ‘Ali ibn Abī Ťālib, Your slave, and the brother of Your Messenger: the one whom You chose as the keeper of Your knowledge and whom You appointed as a guide for whomever You willed from among Your creation, as the guide to those with whom You sent Your messages, as the undisputed ruler of the Day of Religion with Your justice, as the Decisive Judge between Your creation, and as the absolute master over all of it. Salām to him and (may) Allāh’s Mercy and Blessings be upon him. O Allāh! Send Your blessing on Fāťimah, the daughter of Your Prophet, the wife of Your Walī, the mother of the two grandsons (of the Prophet), Ḥasan and Ḥusain, the Two Masters of the Youth of Paradise, and the Purity, the Pure, the Purified, the Pious, the Virtuous, the one who is pleased (with Your Will), and the Master of the Women of All of the Worlds and the Master of all of the Women of Paradise from Your creation – blessings which cannot be measured except by You. O Allāh! Send Your blessing on Ḥasan and Ḥusain, the two grandsons of Your Prophet, the Two Masters of the Youth of Paradise, the two rising Imams in Your creation, the two guides to those with whom You sent Your messages, the two undisputed rulers of religion with Your justice, and the Decisive Judges between Your creation. O Allāh! Send Your blessing on ‘Ali ibn Ḥusain, the Master of the Worshippers, Your slave and the rising Imam in Your creation, Your caliph on Your creation, the guide to those with whom You sent Your messages, the undisputed ruler of religion with Your justice, and the Decisive Judge between Your creation. O Allāh! Send Your blessing on Muḥammad ibn ‘Ali, Your slave, the supporter of Your religion, Your caliph on Your land, the one who rips open the knowledge of the prophets, the rising Imam with Your justice, and the caller to Your religion and the religion of his truthful fathers – blessings which cannot be measured except by You. O Allāh! Send Your blessing on Ja’far ibn Muḥammad Al-Sādiq, Your slave, the supporter of Your religion, Your Decisive Proof on all of Your creation, the truthful and the virtuous one. O Allāh! Send Your blessing on Mūsā ibn Ja’far Al-Kāżim (the one who suppressed his anger), the Righteous Slave, Your tongue among Your creation who speaks with Your knowledge, and the Decisive Proof on Your created beings – blessings which cannot be measured except by You. O Allāh! Send Your blessing on ‘Ali ibn Mūsā Al-Riďā, the one who is pleased with You and the one with whom You are pleased, Your slave, the supporter of Your religion, the rising Imam with Your justice, and the caller to Your religion and the religion of his truthful fathers – blessings which cannot be measured except by You. O Allāh! Send Your blessing on Muḥammad ibn ‘Ali, Your slave, Your Walī, the rising Imam with Your order, and the caller to Your path. O Allāh! Send Your blessing on ‘Ali ibn Muḥammad, Your slave, and the supporter of Your religion. O Allāh! Send Your blessing on Ḥasan ibn ‘Ali, the one who carries out Your orders, the rising Imam in Your creation, Your Decisive Proof who represents Your Prophet, Your witness over Your creation, the one whom You have honoured exclusively, and the caller to Your obedience and the obedience of Your Messenger. May Your blessings be upon all of them – blessings which cannot be measured except by You. O Allāh! Send Your blessing on Your Decisive Proof, Your Walī, and the rising Imam in Your creation – blessings which are increasing and everlasting with which You hasten his reappearance, support him, and allow us to be with him in this life and in the Hereafter. O Allāh! I seek nearness to You by coming to their Ziyārah and by loving them. I befriend their friends and I antagonize their enemies. Therefore, sustain me with the blessings of this life and the Hereafter through them, remove the worries from my soul in this life and the Hereafter (through them), and remove the terrors of the Day of Judgment from me (through them). Then sit next to his head and recite (the following): Salām to you, O Allāh’s Decisive Proof. Salām to you, O Walī of Allāh. Salām to you, O Allāh’s light in the darkness of the earth. Salām to you, O pillar of the religion. Salām to you, O heir of Ādam, the Chosen Slave of Allāh. Salām to you, O heir of Nūḥ, the Prophet of Allāh. Salām to you, O heir of Ibrāhīm, the Friend of Allāh. Salām to you, O heir of Mūsā, the One Addressed by Allāh. Salām to you, O heir of ‘Ǐsā, the Spirit of Allāh. ﷺ Salām to you, O heir of Muḥammad ﷺ, the Love of Allāh. Salām to you, O heir of the Commander of the Believers, ‘Ali ibn Abī Ťālib, the Walī of Allāh. Salām to you, O heir of Ḥasan and Ḥusain, the Two Masters of the Youth of Paradise. Salām to you, O heir of ‘Ali ibn Ḥusain, the Beauty of the Worshippers. Salām to you, O heir of Muḥammad ibn ‘Ali, the One who Rips Open the Knowledge of the first and the last ones. Salām to you, O heir of Ja’far ibn Muḥammad, the Truthful, the Pious, the Virtuous, and the Pure One. Salām to you, O heir of Mūsā ibn Ja’far Al-Kāżim (the one who suppressed his anger), Salām to you, O Truthful Martyr. Salām to you, O Pious and Virtuous Successor. I testify that you established prayers and gave charity. You enjoined good, forbade evil, and you worshiped Allāh loyally until that which is certain (death) came to you. Salām to you and (may) Allāh’s Mercy and Blessings be upon you, O Abal Ḥasan! Verily He (Allāh) is Praised and Glorious. Then fall onto the grave and recite (the following): O Allāh! I have left my homeland for You and traveled across the countries seeking Your Mercy. Therefore, do not disappoint me and do not send me back without fulfilling my requests. (O Allāh!) Have mercy on me because of the way I am falling down on my face on the grave of the son of the brother of Your Prophet and Your Messenger ﷺ. May I sacrifice my father and mother for you. I have come to your Ziyārah as your guest, seeking refuge from my crimes against myself and (from) the weight which I am carrying on my back. Therefore, intercede for me with your Lord on the day of my need and poverty, for verily you have a Praised Status with Allāh and you are distinguished in this life and in the Hereafter with Allāh. Then raise your right hand while placing your left hand on the grave and recite (the following): O Allāh! I seek nearness to You by loving them and following them, and I follow their last one just as I follow their first one. I dissociate myself from any intimate friend other than them. O Allāh! Curse those who changed Your blessings, accused Your Prophet, denied Your signs, scoffed at Your Imam, and incited animosity among the people toward the family of Muḥammad . O Allāh! I seek nearness to You by cursing them and by dissociating myself from them in this life and in the Hereafter. O Raḥmān! O Raḥīm! Then move toward his feet and recite (the following): May Allāh’s blessing be upon you, O Abal Ḥasan. May Allāh’s blessing be upon you, your soul, and your body. You remained patient and you are the authenticated truthful one. May Allāh kill those who killed you with their hands and tongues. Then supplicate (to Allāh) by cursing the killer of the Commander of the Believers , by cursing the killers of Ḥusain , and by cursing all of the killers of the family of the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ. Thereafter, move toward his head again from behind the grave and establish two Rak’ah of prayer. Recite the chapter of Yā Sīn in one Rak’ah (after Al-Ḥamd) and recite the chapter of Al-Raḥmān (after Al-Ḥamd) in the other Rak’ah. Then strive in supplicating (to Allāh) and praying for yourself. Increasingly pray for your parents and your brothers from among the believers. You can stay next to him (in Mash-had) as long as you wish. Try to establish all of your prayers next to his grave In-Shā`allāh."

Then either go near their graves or perform the Ziyārah by pointing toward them from the door which opens to the street of Shubbāk. Recite (the following): Salām to you, O two Wālī(s) of Allāh. Salām to you, O two Decisive Proofs of Allāh. Salām to you, O two lights of Allāh in the darkness of the earth. Salām to you, O two about whom Allāh modified His Will. Salām to you, O two loved ones of Allāh. Salām to you, O two Imams of guidance. I have come to you while I believe in your rights, I antagonize your enemies, and I befriend your friends. I believe in that which you believe in and I disbelieve in that which you disbelieve in. I deem right that which you deemed right and I deem wrong that which you deemed wrong. I ask Allāh, my Lord and your Lord, to send blessing on Muḥammad and his family as my reward for coming to this Ziyārah and to sustain me with accompanying you in Paradise along with your righteous fathers. And I ask Allāh to release me from Hell, to sustain me with your intercession and with accompanying you, and to introduce me to you (on the Day of Judgment). I ask Him not to remove your love and the love of your righteous fathers from my heart, not to make this the last time I come to your Ziyārah, and to resurrect me with you in Paradise with His Mercy. O Allāh! Sustain me with their love and make me die while I believe in their religion. O Allāh! Curse those who oppressed the rights of the family of Muḥammad and take revenge against them. O Allāh! Curse their first and their last ones and increase Your chastisement on them. Degrade them, their followers, their lovers, and those who follow their lovers to the lowest levels of Hell. Verily You have power over all things. O Allāh! Hasten the reappearance of Your Walī and the son of Your Walī and relieve us with their relief. O Most Merciful of the merciful ones. Then strive in praying for yourself and your parents and choose some supplications to recite. If you are performing the Ziyārah near their grave, continue by establishing two Rak’ah next to their graves. However, if you enter the mosque (which is next to the graves) and establish prayers there, pray for that which you want. Verily He (Allāh) is Nigh, ready to answer. This mosque, which is next to their house, is where they used to pray."

He (the Imam ) replied: Establish prayers in the mosques around the grave and recite the following – which can also be recited in all of the sites (of the Infallibles ): Salām upon Allāh’s Divine Authorities and His Chosen Ones. Salām upon Allāh’s Trustees and His Loved Ones. Salām upon Allāh’s Supporters and His Caliphs. Salām upon the places in which Allāh can be known. Salām upon the houses in which Allāh is extolled. Salām upon the Ones who manifest Allāh’s orders and His prohibitions. Salām upon the Ones who call (the people) toward Allāh. Salām upon the Ones who are settled firmly in that which pleases Allāh. Salām upon the Ones who are loyal in obeying Allāh. Salām upon the Ones whom those who follow them have followed Allāh, those who antagonize them have antagonized Allāh, those who know them have known Allāh, those who ignore them have ignored Allāh, those who seek refuge with them have sought refuge with Allāh, and those who abandon them have abandoned Allāh. I take Allāh as witness that I make peace with those who make peace with you, I antagonize those who antagonize you, I believe in that which is secret about you and that which is apparent about you, and I rely on you in all of this. May Allāh’s curse be upon the enemies of the family of Muḥammad from among the Jinn and mankind and I seek nearness to Allāh by dissociating myself from them. And may Allāh’s blessing be upon Muḥammad and his family. Imam added: This is sufficient for performing any Ziyārah (of the infallibles ). And (after reciting it) increasingly send blessings on Muḥammad ﷺ and his family and name them one after the other and dissociate from their enemies. Then choose some supplications and pray for yourself and the believers from among the men and the women."

My father and all of my scholars narrated to me from Muḥammad ibn Yaḥyā Al-‘Aťťār, from Muḥammad ibn Aḥmad ibn Yaḥyā ibn ‘Imrān, from ‘Ali ibn Ḥassān, from ‘Urwah ibn Isḥāq – the nephew of Shu’ayb Al-‘Aqraqūfi, from someone whose name he mentioned, who said: Abū ‘Abdillāh (Imam Sādiq ) said: Recite the following (Ziyārah) next to the grave of Ḥusain ibn ‘Ali . You may also recite the same (Ziyārah) next to the graves of all of the Imams : Salām to you from Allāh and Salām upon Muḥammad ibn ‘Abdillāh ﷺ, Allāh’s Trustee of His revelation and His firmly determined affairs, the last of that which has passed and the one who began that which is yet to come. O Allāh! Send Your blessing on Muḥammad, Your slave and Your Messenger: the one whom You chose with Your knowledge and whom You appointed as a guide for whomever You willed from among Your creation, as the guide to those whom You sent with Your Messages and Your Books, as the undisputed ruler of religion with Your justice, as the Decisive Judge between Your creation, and as the absolute master over all of it. Salām to him and (may) Allāh’s Mercy and Blessings be upon him. In the Ziyārah of the Commander of the Believers , replace it (the beginning of the first line of the above paragraph) with: O Allāh! Send Your blessing on the Commander of the Believers, Your slave and the brother of Your Messenger… In the Ziyārah of Fāťimah (s.a.), replace it with: O Allāh! Send Your blessing on Fāťimah, Your slave and the daughter of Your Messenger… In the Ziyārah of the rest of the Imams , replace it with: O Allāh! Send Your blessing on the son of Your Messenger… And mention the Imams in the same way that you sent blessings on the Prophet ﷺ repeating the above statement for each Imam one after another until you reach the Imam whose Ziyārah you are performing. Then recite (the following): I testify that you are the word of piety, the door of guidance, the strongest handhold, and the Decisive Proof which has been announced to those on it (earth) and those (buried) under the dust. I testify that your souls and your clay are from the same substance which is blessed and purified with the light of Allāh and with His Mercy. I take Allāh and I take you as witnesses that I follow you in everything that is related to my affairs, the rulings of my religion, and the end result of my actions. Therefore, O Allāh, O Most Merciful of the merciful ones, fulfill this for me. Salām to you, O Abā ‘Abdillāh! I testify that you announced, on behalf of Allāh, that which you were ordered to (announce) and fulfilled your obligation toward Allāh without weakness or languor. May Allāh reward you on behalf of your nation, O most truthful one. I testify that Jihad is Jihad only if it is with you, that truth is with you and for you, that you are the source of truth, and that the inheritance of prophethood is with you and with your family. I testify that you established prayers, gave charity, enjoined good and forbade evil, called (the people) toward the path of your Lord with wisdom and by giving good counsel, and that you worshipped your Lord until that which is certain (death) came to you. Then recite (the following): Salām upon Allāh’s “(fully equipped) distinguished angels.” Salām upon Allāh’s descending angels. Salām upon Allāh’s “angels [who come] in an unbroken succession.” Salām upon Allāh’s angels who reside in this Ḥaram with the permission of Allāh. And then recite (the following): O Allāh! Curse the Two who changed Your blessings, disobeyed Your Book, denied Your signs, and accused Your Messenger. Stuff their graves and their stomachs with fire and prepare a painful chastisement for them. O Allāh! Resurrect the Two of them and their followers in Hell while they are blind. And on the Day of Judgment, resurrect the Two of them and their followers “(lying prone) on their faces, blind, dumb, and deaf; their abode shall be Hell; every time it shows abatement, We shall increase the flame on them” (17:97). O Allāh! Do not make this the last time I come to the Ziyārah of the grave of the son of Your Prophet. (O Allāh!) Resurrect him in the Praised Status where You support Your religion with him and kill Your enemies through him. Verily You promised this to him and You are the Lord who does not fail His promise. You can recite the same next to the graves of all of the Imams . In-Shā`allāh when you go to the Ziyārah of any of the Imams , you should (also) recite the following: Salām to you, O Walī of Allāh. Salām to you, O Decisive Proof of Allāh. Salām to you, O light of Allāh in the darkness of the earth. Salām to you, O Imam of the believers, heir of the knowledge of the prophets, progeny of the successors, and the witness on the Day of Religion. I testify that you, your fathers before you, and your children after you are my masters, my leaders, and my Imams. And I testify that you are Allāh’s Chosen Ones, His Trustees, and His Decisive Proofs who have been announced to (everyone). Allāh chose you with His knowledge as the supporters of His religion, as the executors of His affairs, as the keepers of His knowledge, as the protectors of His secret, as the translators of His revelation, as the sources of His words, as the pillars of His oneness, and as the witnesses over His creation. He (Allāh) entrusted (the affairs of) His creation to you and He made you inherit His Book. He honoured you exclusively with the revelation and He gave you the hidden interpretation (of the verses of the Qur’an). He made you the containers of His wisdom and the lighthouses in His lands and He made you the examples of His light. He placed His knowledge in you, protected you from error, purified you from impurities, and kept off any uncleanliness from you. The blessings are complete through you, the sects have joined together through you, and words are united through you. Obeying you is made mandatory (by Allāh) and loving you is obligatory. You are the noble Divine Authorities of Allāh and you are His honourable slaves. O son of the Messenger of Allāh! I have come to you while I believe in your rights, have insight regarding your status, antagonize your enemies, and befriend your friends. May I sacrifice my father and mother for you. May Allāh’s blessing and Salām be upon you. I have come to your Ziyārah as your guest, seeking refuge from my crimes against myself and (from) the weight which I am carrying on my back. Therefore, intercede for me with your Lord, for verily you have a known rank with Allāh and you are distinguished with Allāh. I believe in Allāh and in that which was revealed to you, and I follow your last one just as I follow your first one. I dissociate myself from any intimate friend other than you and I disbelieve in Jibt, Ťāghūt, Lāt, and ‘Uzzā. The above Ḥadīth has also been narrated to me through the following chain: Muḥammad ibn Ḥusain ibn Mat Al-Jawhari, from Muḥammad ibn Aḥmad ibn Yaḥyā ibn ‘Imrān, from ‘Ali ibn Ḥassān, from ‘Urwah ibn Isḥāq – the nephew of Shu’ayb Al-‘Aqraqūfi, from someone whose name he mentioned, from Abī ‘Abdillāh ."

The rewards for this worship will be registered for the one who is dead and (also) for him (the person who came to visit the grave of the believer). When this believer will be resurrected, he will not undergo any terror without Allāh removing it from him through the angel who was dedicated to his grave, and he will enter Paradise in the company of that angel. He added, “(When you go to the graves of the believers), recite (the chapter of) Al-Ḥamd one time, (the chapter of) Innā Anzalnāh seven times, then recite the Mu’awwadhatayn, (the chapter of) Qul Huwallāhu Aḥad, and Ayatul Kursī, each three times.”"

Muḥammad ibn ‘Abdillāh ibn Ja’far Al-Ḥimyari narrated to me from his father, from ‘Ali ibn Muḥammad ibn Sulaymān, from Muḥammad ibn Khālid, from ‘Abdillāh ibn Ḥammād Al-Basri, who said: Abū ‘Abdillāh (Imam Sādiq ) said to me: There is a blessing close to you (people) which has not been given to anyone else. However, I do not think that you understand its true value, you do not adhere to it, nor are you committed to it. Verily there are a dedicated group of people for this blessing who have been identified by their names, and Allāh, with His Mercy and Compassion, has willed a happy ending for them and He has bestowed this blessing on them without any will nor power from themselves. I asked, “May I sacrifice myself for you! What is this blessing that you have described for us but have not named?” Imam replied, “The Ziyārah of my grandfather, Ḥusain ibn ‘Ali .” Imam added: Verily he is the lonely one in the remote land. Those who go to his Ziyārah, weep over him. And those who do not go to his Ziyārah, grieve over him. Those who have not seen him (his grave) are devastated with anguish over him, and those who look at the grave of his son (‘Ali Al-Akbar ) next to his feet in that desert, sympathize with him. He had no family in that land nor any intimate friend and the people of disbelief denied his rights, neglected him, and rose against him. They killed him and they left his body (unburied) to be eaten by beasts. They forbade him from drinking from the water of the Euphrates (River) from which even the dogs could drink. They neglected their obligations toward the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ and they ignored the orders of the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ about him and his family. He (Imam Ḥusain ) was eventually abandoned in his grave, and he was struck down on layers of dust among his family members and his Shia. He is alone and far away from his grandfather ﷺ (in Madīnah), after having been close to him. He is alone in the house which is not being visited except by those whose hearts Allāh has tested for faith and whom He has allowed to know our rights. I said, “May I sacrifice myself for you! I used to go to his Ziyārah until I was afflicted with (serving) this ruler and protecting his wealth. Now I am well-known among them. Therefore, I have stopped going to his Ziyārah out of precaution, although I am aware of its blessings.” Imam asked, “Do you know the merits of going to his Ziyārah and the reward that we have prepared for those who go to his Ziyārah?” I replied, “No.” Imam said, “As for the merits (of the Ziyārah), Allāh boasts about those who go to his Ziyārah to the angels in the heavens. And as for their reward with us, (verily) we seek Allāh’s Mercy for those who go to his Ziyārah every morning and evening.” Imam added: My father narrated to me that since the day he was killed, his site has never been deserted by those who send blessings on him from among the angels, Jinn, mankind, or beasts. (Verily) everything (in the creation) envies those who go to his Ziyārah, and tries to touch them (his Zuwwār), and seeks blessings by looking at them for having looked at the grave of Ḥusain . Then Imam said, “I have heard that in the middle of the month of Sha’bān, some people from the suburbs of Kūfah – and other cities – go to his Ziyārah and their women lament over Ḥusain , the reciters recite poems about him, the speakers narrate his story, the lamenters lament over him, and the poets recite eulogies about him.” I replied, “Yes, may I sacrifice myself for you! I have seen some of that which you described.” Imam said: Praise be to Allāh who appointed some people to go to our Ziyārah, extol us, and recite eulogies about us. And (praise be to Allāh) who has made some of our enemies slander our Shia for their nearness to us while other enemies insult them and condemn their actions."

Muḥammad ibn ‘Abdillāh ibn Ja’far Al-Ḥimyari narrated to me from his father, from ‘Ali ibn Muḥammad ibn Sulaymān, from Muḥammad ibn Khālid, from ‘Abdillāh ibn Ḥammād Al-Basri, from ‘Abdillāh (ibn ‘Abdil Raḥmān) Al-Asam, from ‘Abdillāh ibn Bukayr Al-Arjāni, who said: I accompanied Abā ‘Abdillāh (Imam Sādiq ) from Madīnah to Makkah. On our journey, we stopped in an area called ‘Usfān and then we passed by a black, frightening mountain which was to the left of the road. I said to him, “O son of the Messenger of Allāh! How frightening this mountain is! I have never seen anything like this on our route.” Imam asked, “O son of Bukayr! Do you know which mountain this is?” I replied, “No.” Imam said: This is a mountain called Kamad and it overlooks one of the valleys in Hell which contains the killers of my father, Ḥusain . The liquids of Hell flow under the killers of my father (in this valley). These liquids include Ghislīn, Sadīd, Ḥamīm, that which emerges from the Putrid Well, that which comes out from the sins in Falaq, that which comes out from the clay of Khabāl (pus), that which comes out from Jahannam, that which comes out from the blazing fires, that which comes out from Ḥuťamah, that which comes out from Saqar, that which comes out from Ḥamīm, that which comes out from Hāwiyah, and that which comes out from Sa’īr. Every time I pass by this mountain on my journey, I stop and see those Two seeking refuge with me and I look at the killers of my father , and I say to the two of them: Verily you established the foundations for that which they (the killers of Ḥusain ) did. You showed us no mercy at the time of your ruling. You killed us, denied and usurped our rights, and you tyrannized over our affairs by deposing us. May Allāh not have mercy on those who have mercy on the two of you. (Now) taste the evil results of that which you brought forth because Allāh is not unjust to (any of His) slaves. Sometimes I climb the mountain of Kamad which is where those two are located, and I stand there to soothe some of that which is in my heart, and the second one begs and succumbs to despair more intensely. I asked, “May I sacrifice myself for you! What do you hear when you climb this mountain?” Imam replied: I hear the voices of those two. They call out, “Come toward us so that we can talk to you, verily we repent.” And (then) I hear a call from the mountains which cries out, “Answer them and tell them, ‘Remain condemned in it, and speak not to me’ (23:108).” I asked, “May I sacrifice myself for you! Who else is with them?” Imam replied, “Every tyrant pharaoh whose actions Allāh has mentioned (in the Qur’an) and everyone who taught disbelief to the slaves of Allāh.” I asked, “Who are they?” Imam replied: The likes of Bulis who taught the Jews that “…the hand of Allāh is tied up!” (5:64); the likes of Nasťūr who taught the Christians that ‘Ǐsā “…Al-Masīḥ is the son of Allāh” (9:30) and told them that they are three; the likes of Fir’awn (at the time) of Mūsā who said, “I am your lord, the most high” (79:24); and the likes of Numrūd who said, “I have overpowered everyone on earth and I have killed those in the heavens”; and the killer of the Commander of the Believers , the killer of Fāťimah and Muḥsin , and the killers of Ḥasan and Ḥusain ; and (also) Mu’āwiyah and ‘Amr (ibn ‘Ās), who have no hope of being saved, and anyone who incited animosity against us and helped (our enemies) with his tongue, wealth, or hand against us will also be with them. I asked, “May I sacrifice myself for you! You hear all of this and you are not frightened?” Imam replied: O son of Bukayr! Our hearts are not like the hearts of the people. We are Allāh’s obedient, purified, and chosen slaves. We see that which people do not see and we hear that which people do not hear. The angels come down to us (while we are travelling) on our conveyances. They roll in our beds. They witness us when we eat, they attend our funerals, and they bring the news of that which will take place in the future to us. They establish prayers with us, they pray for us, they place their wings over us, and our children roll over their wings. They prevent the animals from coming near us. They bring various types of seasonal fruits for us from different lands and they bring water from every land for us which we find in our jugs. There is not any day nor hour nor any prayer time when the angels are not prepared (to serve us). The news of every land and that which takes place in it, the news of the Jinn, and the news of all of the angels in the heavens are brought to us every night. Whenever an angel dies in any land and is replaced with another angel, we are informed of it, and we are informed about the performance of this angel in comparison with the angel that he replaced. The news of all of the six earths all the way to the seventh earth is brought to us (at all times). I asked, “May I sacrifice myself for you! Where does this mountain end?” Imam replied, “In the seventh earth, and Hell is located in one of its valleys. There are many keepers who guard this valley. Their number is greater than the (number of) stars in the sky, drops of rain, creation in the seas, and the grains of soil in the earth. Every one of these keepers from among the angels has a dedicated duty which he carries out and never abandons.” I asked, “May I sacrifice myself for you! The angels report to all of you?” Imam said: No. They only report to the Owner of the Matter (the Imam of each time). Verily we are the rulers in matters over which none of the slaves of Allāh can rule. Whenever someone does not accept our ruling (about those specific matters), the angels force him to (carry out) our will and order the keepers who are dedicated to him, to force him to (carry out) our will. And if they are among the disbelieving Jinn, the angels put shackles around them and torture them until they submit to our ruling in those matters. I asked, “May I sacrifice myself for you! Can the Imam see everything from the East to the West?” Imam replied: O son of Bukayr! How can he be the Decisive Proof of Allāh over the entire earth without seeing and ruling over everyone?! And how can he be the Decisive Proof over people who are not in his presence, who cannot reach him, and over whom he has no power?! How can he convey the message of Allāh and act as Allāh’s witness over the creation if he cannot see them?! How can he be the Decisive Proof on the people if he is hidden from them while he has been appointed as the medium between the slaves and Allāh so that he carries out the orders of his Lord to them?! Allāh says, “We have not sent you but to all of mankind” (34:28). This verse refers to everything on earth (not only mankind). The Decisive Proof after the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ fills the post of the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ after him. He is the judge in that which the nation disagrees about, the one who gives people their rights, the one who carries out the orders of Allāh, and he is the one who justly rules between the people. And how can the (following) words of Allāh be fulfilled if the Imam is not among the people?! Allāh says, “Soon We shall show Our signs to them in the horizons, and within themselves” (41:53). And which sign other than us did Allāh show to the people in the horizons?! Allāh says, “And We did not show them any sign but it was greater than the other” (43:48). Which sign is greater than us?! I swear to Allāh that Banī Hāshim and Quraysh know well that which Allāh has bestowed upon us but jealousy destroyed them, just as it destroyed Iblīs. Verily they come to us when they are in distress and when they are in fear and they ask us (questions), and we clarify their questions for them. Then they say to us, “We testify that you are the people of knowledge.” Then they leave us and say, “We have not seen anyone more astray than those who follow them (the Ahlul Bayt ) and accept their words.” I asked, “May I sacrifice myself for you! If the grave of Ḥusain was to be disinterred, would anything be found in it?” Imam replied: O son of Bukayr! Your questions are (always) about great matters. Verily Ḥusain along with his father, mother, and his brother, Ḥasan , are with the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ in his house and they are being rewarded and sustained, (just) as the Prophet ﷺ is. If his grave would have been disinterred during his time, he would have been found there. However, today he is alive and sustained, and he is with his Lord. He looks at his camp (in Karbalā) and he also looks at the Throne until the time when it is ordered to carry him. Verily Ḥusain is hanging on to the right side of the Throne and says, “O my Lord! Fulfill Your promise to me.” Verily he looks at those who go to his Ziyārah and he knows them; he knows the names of their fathers, their ranks and their positions with Allāh, and that which they carry along with them even better than you know your own sons. Verily Ḥusain looks at those who cry over him and he seeks forgiveness for them as an act of mercy and he asks his father to seek forgiveness for them. And he says to them (those who cry over him), “O those who cry (over me)! If you knew that which has been prepared for you, your happiness would be greater than your restlessness.” Imam continued, “Verily all of the angels in the heavens and in the Ḥā`ir who hear those who cry on Ḥusain seek forgiveness for them, and they (the Zuwwār) will return with no sins.”"

Abul ‘Abbās Muḥammad ibn Ja’far narrated to me from Muḥammad ibn Ḥusain ibn Abil Khaťťāb, from Manī’, from Safwān ibn Yaḥyā, from Safwān ibn Mihrān Al-Jammāl, who said: Abū ‘Abdillāh (Imam Sādiq ) said: The least that a Zā`ir of Ḥusain gains is that every good deed will be registered as one million good deeds for him and every bad deed will be registered as (only) one. And how can one be compared to a million?! The Imam added: O Safwān! Rejoice, for verily Allāh has some angels who carry rods made of light and when the Keepers are about to register a bad deed for the Zā`ir of Ḥusain , these angels tell the Keepers to stop. Therefore, the Keepers will not register the bad deed. However, once the Zā`ir performs a good deed, these angels tell the Keeper, “Register now! ‘They are the ones whom Allāh changes their bad deeds to good deeds” (25:70)."

Muḥammad ibn ‘Abdillāh ibn Ja’far Al-Ḥimyari narrated to me from his father, from ‘Ali ibn Muḥammad ibn Sālim, from Muḥammad ibn Khālid, from ‘Abdillāh ibn Ḥammād Al-Basri, from ‘Abdillāh ibn ‘Abdil Raḥman Al-Asam, from Ḥammād ibn ‘Uthmān, who said: Abū ‘Abdillāh (Imam Sādiq ) said: When the Prophet ﷺ was taken to the heavens on his journey (at night), he was told, “Verily Allāh, the Blessed and the Exalted, will test you with three afflictions to see how patient you will be.” The Prophet ﷺ replied, “I submit to Your command, O Lord. And I have no power to stay patient except through You. What are the three tests?” He was told, “The first (test) is hunger and giving preference to the needy over yourself and your family.” The Prophet ﷺ replied, “I have accepted, O Lord. I am pleased (with Your Will) and I submit to it, and I seek success and patience with You.” He was told: The second (test) is that you will be belied and you will be in extreme fear (for your life). You should spend your wealth, your blood, and your soul fighting against the people of disbelief, you should remain patient when you will be harassed by the disbelievers and the hypocrites, and you should remain patient when you will be hurt and wounded in battles. The Prophet ﷺ replied, “I have accepted, O Lord. I am pleased (with Your Will) and I submit to it, and I seek success and patience with You.” He was told, “The third test is that your family will be killed after you. As for your brother, ‘Ali, your nation will slander and rebuke him, they will be violent with him, they will deprive him and usurp his rights, they will oppress him, and finally they will kill him.” The Prophet ﷺ replied, “I have accepted, O Lord. And I am pleased (with Your Will), and I seek success and patience with You.” He was told: As for your daughter, she will be oppressed and deprived, and the rights which you gave her will be usurped. She will be beaten while she is pregnant, her sanctity will be breached, and her house will be entered without permission. Then she will be humiliated and disrespected. She will find no protector, she will suffer from a miscarriage because she will be beaten, and she will die as a result of that beating. The Prophet ﷺ replied, “Surely we are Allāh’s and to Him we shall surely return’ (2:156). I have accepted, O Lord and I submit to it (Your Will), and I seek success and patience with You.” He was told, “She will have two sons from your brother. One of whom your nation will loot, stab, and kill unfaithfully.” The Prophet ﷺ replied, “Surely we are Allāh’s and to Him we shall surely return’ (2:156). I have accepted, O Lord and I submit to it (Your Will), and I seek success with You for being patient.” He was told: As for her second son, your nation will invite him for Jihād but then they will kill him while he will be helpless. They will also kill his children and his family members who will be with him and they will loot his women. He will ask for help from Me but I have already willed his martyrdom and the martyrdom of those with him. His killing will be a decisive argument against everyone in the creation. The inhabitants of the heavens and the earths will weep and lose patience over him. And the angels, who will not be able to help him, will cry over him. However, I shall raise a man from his progeny whose shadow is with me under the Throne and through whom I shall support him (Ḥusain ). He will fill the earth with justice and equity. The fear from him will travel with him and he will kill so many that people will doubt him. The Prophet ﷺ replied, “Surely we are Allāh’s.” Then he was told, “Raise your head.” Imam added: The Prophet ﷺ said: I looked up and saw a man who looked and smelled better than all people. He had a blessed visage and he was wearing clothes made of light. Light was emanating from his forehead, from over him, and from under him. He was surrounded by several angels who could not be counted except by Allāh, the Great and Almighty. Then I asked him to approach me. He came close to me and kissed my forehead. I said: O Lord! Who will this man avenge and for whom will he show his anger and for what reason have you prepared these angels?! You informed me about that which will be afflicted upon my family. You can support them against their oppressors if You will. You have promised victory for me and my family and I await the fulfillment of Your promise. Verily I have accepted and am pleased with Your Will and I submit to it, and I seek success and help from You to be pleased and patient. I was told: As for your brother, he will enter the “garden of abode as residence” (32:19) for staying patient. On the Day of Resurrection, I shall establish him as an argument on the creation and I shall authorize him to stand by your Pool (the Pool of Kawthar) where he will distribute water to your friends and prevent your enemies from drinking from it. I will make Hell cool and safe for him so that he can enter it and bring out anyone who has even an atom of love for you. I will make all of you (the Ahlul Bayt ) dwell at the same level in Paradise. As for your son, who will be abandoned and killed, and your other son, who will be betrayed and killed while he will be helpless, I will decorate My Throne with them for having suffered from the afflictions which befell them (in their lives), and they will be honoured in ways which are unimaginable by anyone from among mankind. Therefore, rely on Me. I shall honour those who go to his (Husain’s) grave because those who go to his Ziyārah have come to your Ziyārah, and those who come to your Ziyārah have come to My Ziyārah, and I will surely honour those who come to My Ziyārah. I will fulfill all of their requests and reward them in such a way that everyone will envy them when they see how I dignify them and the honour which I have prepared for them. As for your daughter, I will make her stand next to My Throne and she shall be told, “Verily Allāh has appointed you as the ruler over His creation. Therefore, rule however you want regarding those who oppressed you and your children, for your ruling will be executed.” So she will come to the courtyard (where the judgment will take place) and she will order those who oppressed her to be taken to Hell. Then the oppressor shall say, “Alas, woe to me for what I neglected toward Allāh” (39:56) and he will wish to return to life. “The oppressor shall bite his hands saying: ‘Would that I had taken the Path with the Messenger. Woe to me! Would that I had not taken so-and-so as my friend!” (25:27-28). And “until when he comes to Us he will say: ‘Would that there was a distance of two easts between you and me, you are an evil companion.’ It will not profit [them] on this day because [they] have oppressed, and [they] will be partners in chastisement” (43:38-39). The oppressor shall say, “You alone shall judge between Your servants concerning that wherein they have differed’ (39:46) or is the judge someone else?” They will be told, “The curse of Allāh be on the oppressors who hinder (people) from the path of Allāh and seek to make it crooked, and disbelieve in the Hereafter” (7:44-45). Imam continued: The first judgment will be between Muḥsin ibn ‘Ali and his killer – referring to the second usurper. Then he will be brought forth along with Qunfudh and they will be lashed with whips of fire. The whips will be such that if one of them hits the oceans, all of the oceans will boil from the east to the west and if (even one whip) touches the mountains, they will all melt and turn to ash. Then the Commander of the Believers will kneel in front of Allāh so that Allāh judges between him and the fourth (usurper) – referring to Mu’āwiyah. Thereafter, they (the second usurper, Qunfudh, and Mu’āwiyah) will be thrown in a well (of fire) which will be covered so no one can see them and they will not be able to see anyone. So those who followed them (in this life) will say, “O Our Lord, show us those two among the Jinn and men who had led us astray. We will trample them under our feet so that they may become of those who are the lowest” (41:29). Allāh, the Great and Almighty, will reply, “It will not profit you on this day because you have oppressed, and you will be partners in chastisement” (43:39). This is when they will scream in distress and call for destruction. The Two will come to the Pool, (imprisoned) by the Keepers (of Hell) and will say to the Commander of the Believers , “Forgive us, give us some water, and save us.” They will be told: “But when they shall see it near, grieved shall be the faces of those who disbelieve, and it shall be said (to them): ‘this is what you have been calling for” (67:27) by referring to yourselves as the commanders of the believers. Return to Hell thirsty. You shall receive no drink but Ḥamīm and Ghislīn and “the intercession of the intercessors shall not avail [you]” (74:48)."

Which deed is better: going for Hajj or giving charity?” Imam said, “(The answer to) this question depends on another question. Are there sufficient funds to go for Hajj?” I replied, “No.” Imam said, “If the money is sufficient to go for Hajj, then going for Hajj is better than giving charity. However, if it is not much (money), then giving charity is better.” I asked, “What about fighting in the way of Allāh?” Imam said, “Fighting in the way of Allāh at the time of Jihād is the best deed after the obligatory prayers. However, it is not accepted unless it is with an Imam.” I asked, “What about going for Ziyārah?” Imam replied, “(Going to) the Ziyārah of the Prophet ﷺ, the Ziyārah of Ḥamzah , the Ziyārah of the successors , and (specifically) the Ziyārah of Ḥusain in Iraq (is the best of deeds).” I asked, “What are the rewards for going to the Ziyārah of Ḥusain ?” Imam replied: Those who go to the Ziyārah of Ḥusain will submerge (themselves) in the Mercy (of Allāh) and earn (His) pleasure. Evil will be kept away from them, their sustenance will increase, and the angels will surround them. They will be surrounded with a light which will allow the Keepers to identify them and they will not pass by any of the Keepers without them praying for them."

Aḥmad ibn Ja’far Al-Baladi narrated from Muḥammad ibn Yazīd Al-Bakri, from Mansūr ibn Nasr Al-Madā`ini, from ‘Abdil Raḥman ibn Muslim, who said: I went to Imam Kāżim and asked him, “Which one is better: going to the Ziyārah of Ḥusain ibn ‘Ali , or going to the Ziyārah of the Commander of the Believers , or… – and I named the other Imams one by one.” Imam replied: O ‘Abdal Raḥmān! Those who go to the Ziyārah of our first one are like those who go to the Ziyārah of our last one, and those who go to the Ziyārah of our last one are like those who go to the Ziyārah of our first one. Those who follow our first one are like those who follow our last one, and those who follow our last one are like those who follow our first one. Those who fulfill the needs of one of our followers are like those who fulfill the needs of all of us (the Imams ). O ‘Abdal Raḥmān! Love us, love those who love us, love in our way, and make others love for our sake. Befriend us and befriend those who befriend us, and hate those who hate us. Beware! Those who refute our words are like those who refute the words of our grandfather, the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ, and those who refute the words of the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ are like those who refute the words of Allāh. Beware O ‘Abdal Raḥmān! Those who hate us hate Muḥammad ﷺ, and those who hate Muḥammad ﷺ hate Allāh, and those who hate Allāh, the Great and Almighty, truly deserve to be burned in Hell by Allāh and they shall have no helpers."

Muḥammad ibn Ḥasan ibn Aḥmad ibn Walīd narrated to me from Muḥammad ibn Ḥasan Al-Saffār, from ‘Abbās ibn Ma’rūf, from ‘Abdillāh ibn ‘Abdil Raḥmān Al-Asam, from Ḥusain, from Al-Ḥalabi, who said: Abū ‘Abdillāh (Imam Sādiq ) said: When Ḥusain was killed, our family in Madīnah heard a caller cry out, “Today the afflictions have descended on this nation. You shall not see any pleasure until your Qā`im rises and pleases you by killing your enemies and avenging one (Ḥusain ) by (killing) many.” They were frightened after hearing this call and they said that something must have happened of which they were unaware. After some time, they heard the news of the killing of Ḥusain , and when they counted the (number of) days, they discovered that (he was killed) on the same night that they had heard the caller. I said, “May I sacrifice myself for you! How long will you (the Ahlul Bayt ) and we (the Shia) remain under these (circumstances of) intense fear and killing?!” Imam replied, “(This situation will continue) until seventy (periods of) relief take place in different intervals and until the time of seventy comes. Then the flags will approach one after another at the time of seventy and they will look like organized units. Those who see that time will see that which will please them.” Imam added: When Ḥusain was killed, someone came to the camp (of the enemies) and screamed and rebuked them. He said, “How can I not scream when the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ is standing and looking at the earth and at your party. I am afraid that he will supplicate to Allāh against the people of earth and I will be destroyed as one of them!!!” So the soldiers said to one another, “This is a man who has lost his mind.” However the TAWWĀBŪN said, “By Allāh!!! What did we do to ourselves?!!! We killed the Master of the Youth of Paradise for the son of Sumayyah.” Then they rose against Ubaydillāh ibn Ziyād and that which happened to them happened. I asked, “May I sacrifice myself for you! Who was the one who screamed (at the army)?” Imam replied, “We do not believe that he was anyone but Jabra`īl. Verily if he had been given permission, he would have screamed at them in such a way that their souls would have left their bodies and would have entered Hell (immediately). However, they were given respite to increase their sins and they shall have a painful chastisement.” I asked, “May I sacrifice myself for you! What do you say about someone who has the ability to go to the Ziyārah of Ḥusain but does not?” Imam replied: I say that he has disowned the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ and disowned us. He has belittled a matter that is obligatory on him. Verily Allāh will look after the needs of those who go to the Ziyārah of Ḥusain and He will take care of every matter that is important to them in this life. Verily going to the Ziyārah of Ḥusain increases the sustenance of the slaves (of Allāh) and they will be recompensed for the money that they spend in the Ziyārah. Verily fifty years of sin will be forgiven for them and they will return to their families having every sin and mistake erased from their book (of deeds). If they die during their Ziyārah, the angels will descend and perform their ablution (Ghusl). The doors of Paradise will be opened for them and its fragrance will surround them until the day they are resurrected. If they do not (die during their Ziyārah), the door from which their sustenance descends will be opened and they will be recompensed with ten thousand Dirhams for every Dirham they spent during their Ziyārah and their recompense will be kept safely for them. Therefore, when they are resurrected, they will be told, “You have ten thousand Dirhams for every Dirham you spent and Allāh (has postponed your recompense and) has kept it safely for you with Himself.”"
