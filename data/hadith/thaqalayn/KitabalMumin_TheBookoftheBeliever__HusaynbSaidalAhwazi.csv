It has been narrated that Abu 'Abd Allah recounted: Prophet Musa , son of 'Imran, had a brother-in-faith whom he cared for, loved and respected. A man once came to this friend of Musa and asked him to intercede on his behalf with a tyrant who happened to be a king of the Israelites. 'By Allah, I do not know him and have never asked him for a favor,' friend of Musa replied. 'What have you to lose,' the man persisted, 'Perhaps; Allah will fulfill my need through you.' So, he went off with the man without Musa's knowledge and approached the tyrannical king. When the tyrant saw him, he drew him close and showed him utmost respect. The latter asked the king for the man's favor and it was granted. Shortly thereafter, the king died. The people of his kingdom gathered in large numbers for his funeral and the marketplaces were shut. It so happened that on the very same day, Musa's brother-in-faith passed away, too. He had a tendency to keep his house door shut and whenever Musa wanted to pay him a visit; he would simply let himself in. Now it came to pass that Musa forgot the man for three days. On the fourth day, he said to himself, 'I have neglected my brother for three days. I must visit him.' When he opened the door to let himself in, Musa found his friend dead and the creatures of the earth were feeding on his face. 'O Lord,' Musa called out, 'Your enemy died and You brought forth a multitude for his funeral, but when You caused Your friend to die, You let the creatures eat him up?' 'O Musa,' the Lord [M.G] replied, 'My friend begged this tyrant for a favor and he granted it; so, I gathered the people of his kingdom for his funeral (to honor him) as a reward for his having granted a believer's request and that he may go forth from the world whilst I owe him no reward. And as for this believer, I allowed the creatures of the earth to feed on him because of his having asked a tyrant for a favor; and it was not pleasing to Me that he should leave this world without any sin.'"

It has been narrated that Abu Ja'far said: A Prophet from the children of Israel once passed by a dead man half of whose body was buried under a wall and the other half was eaten by scavenger birds and wild dogs. Then he came to a city where one of its notables had died and had been placed on a bed adorned with velvet and surrounded by groups of people. So, he called to Allah [M.G] saying, 'O Lord, You are most surely a Just Judge and You do no injustice. That servant had never associated a partner to You even for a moment; yet You caused him to die such a (despicable) death. And this servant of Yours had never believed in You for even a moment; yet You have given him such an (honorable) death.' Allah [M.G] replied, 'My servant: I am indeed as You have said—a Just Judge who does no injustice. That (believing) servant had a sin left with Me; so, I caused him to die such a death that he may meet Me with nothing left on him (for punishment). And this (disbelieving) servant of mine had a good deed leftover with Me; so, I caused him to die thus that he may meet Me with nothing left for him with Me (as reward).'"

It has been narrated from Ibn Abu 'Umayr through some of his companions that he said:Prophet Musa was once walking along the sea shore when a fisherman came by and prostrated himself before the Sun, uttering words of polytheism. Then he threw his fishing net in (to the sea) and drew it out filled (with fish). Then he threw it in again and once again it came out full. Once more he repeated this and once again it came out full until he was satisfied then he departed. Then another man came along, performed the ablution and stood in prayer, praising and glorifying Allah. Then he flung his net in but drew it back empty. So he repeated it and again he met with no success. Once again, he threw his net in and this time he caught a small fish. So, he praised and thanked Allah and went off. Seeing this, Musa called out, 'O Lord! When Your servant came along and denied You, praying to the Sun and uttering blasphemy, his net was filled in with fish repeatedly until he was satisfied and left. And when Your believing servant came along, performed the ablution, prayed, glorified, praised and supplicated to You and then threw his net in, he received nothing but a small fish?' So, Allah [M.G] revealed to him, 'O Musa! Look to your right.' Musa looked and it was revealed to him what Allah [M.G] had set aside (in reward) for the believing servant. Then it was said to him, 'O Musa, now look to your left.' And he saw what (punishment) was awaiting the disbelieving servant. Then Allah [M.G] spoke, 'O Musa, (in reality) the one whom I gave did not benefit anything and nor did the one I denied lose anything.'' O Lord!' responded Musa , '(Indeed) it is the duty of all that know You to be content with whatever You do (for them).'"

It has been reported that al-Mu'alla ibn Khunays said: I said to Abu 'Abd Allah , 'What is the right of a believer on a fellow believer?' 'I feel sympathy for you,' he replied, 'I fear that you would know and not act upon it and you would neglect it and not safeguard it.' I said, 'There is no power and no strength except with Allah!' Believers have seven obligatory rights incumbent on each other,' Abu 'Abd Allah said, 'each of these rights are mandatory on brothers-in-faith to fulfill. If he (a believer) omits any right from these, he has come out of the guardianship of Allah and has forsaken obedience to Him. The simplest of these rights is that you should love for him (your brother-in-faith) what you love for yourself and you should despise for him what you despise for yourself. The second is that you should help him with your self, your wealth, your tongue, your hands and your feet. The third is that you should pursue what pleases him and avoid his displeasure and obey his command. The fourth is that you should be his eyes, his guide and his mirror. The fifth is that you should not fill your stomach whilst he is hungry, you should not be quenched whilst he is thirsty and you should not clothe yourself whilst he is naked. The sixth is that if you should have a servant whilst he does not have one and you should have a maid to serve you and he does not have a maid to serve him; you should send over your servant to wash his clothes and prepare his food and bedding. The seventh is that you keep his vows, answer his calls, respond when he invites you, visit him when he is ill and accompany his bier; and if he should have a need, you should rush to fulfill it and not give him the trouble to ask you for it. When you have done all these, then your friendship unites with his friendship and his friendship with yours. Another tradition has reported that Mu'alla said that the Imam added, 'When you have done that, your friendship is then joined to his; and his friendship is joined to Allah's.'"

It has been related that 'Isa ibn Abu Mansur said: 'Abd Allah ibn Abu Ya'fur, 'Abd Allah ibn Talha and I were with Abu 'Abd Allah when he spoke unprompted: 'O Ibn Abu Ya'fur, the Messenger of Allah has said: One who has six qualities shall be (placed) before Allah [M.G] and on His right side.' 'May I be ransomed for you! What are they?” asked Ibn Abu Ya'fur. The Imam said, 'The first is that a Muslim should love for his brother-in-faith what he loves for the dearest person in his family; and a Muslim should detest for his brother what he detests for the dearest in his family; and he should be sincere to him.' At this point, Ibn Abu Ya'fur wept and asked, 'How should he be sincere to him?' 'O' Ibn Abu Ya'fur,' the Imam responded, 'when the brother-in-faith is in a state of anxiety, he should share his anxiety; and if he is joyful, he should share his joy. If he is grieved, he should share his grief; and if he is able to relieve him of distress, he should do so, otherwise he should pray to Allah for him. Then, Abu 'Abd Allah said, 'These three qualities are for you and the remaining three qualities are for us: you should recognize our superiority, you should tread in our footsteps, and you should await for our future rule. So, whoever has had all these qualities shall be before Allah; and by their radiance, those below them will be illumined. As for those who shall be on the right side of Allah, they shall be such that if others happen to see their status, they would find life unbearable because of what they would witness of the former's superiority.' So, Ibn Abu Ya'fur asked, 'Why would they not be seen by others if they were on the right side of Allah?' The Imam replied, 'They shall be covered with the light of Allah. Have you not heard the tradition that the Messenger of Allah used to say: Indeed, the Believers shall be on the right side and before Allah, and their faces shall be whiter than snow and more radiant than the shining Sun? And people will ask: Who are they? And it will be said: These are those who loved each other for the sake of Allah.'"

A believer has more rights than the Ka'bah. And he said: “A believer is the brother of the other believer; his eyes and his guide. He neither cheats him nor deserts him.4 And of the rights of a Muslim on another Muslim is that he should not eat his fill while his brother is hungry, he should not drink water while his brother is thirsty and should not dress himself while his brother has no clothes. How great the right of a Muslim on his Muslim brother is! The Imam also said: “Love for your Muslim brother what you love for yourself. If you are in need, ask him; and when he asks you, give him. Do not tire doing good to him as he does not tire for you. Be a support to him for he is a support to you. When he is away, safeguard his interests in his absence; and when he is present, visit him, show him respect and honor him, for he is from you and you are from him. If he is angry with you, do not leave him until you have removed his resentment. If good befalls him, thank Allah; and if he is afflicted, compensate him, relieve him of it and help him."

According to another series of narrators, the Imam continued: When he comes to something terrifying, the form shall say, 'this is not for you,' and when it comes to something good, it shall say, 'this is for you.' Thus it will continue with him, comforting him from what he fears and giving him glad tidings of what he desires until it stands with him before Allah [M.G]. When he is instructed to enter Paradise, the form shall say to him, 'Enjoy Paradise, for Allah [M.G] has instructed you to enter it.' He shall say to it, 'Who are you? May Allah have mercy upon you, for you gave me glad tidings when I came forth from my grave and you accompanied me in my journey and have informed me of good news from my Lord.' 'I am the happiness that you brought to your (believing) brothers in the world,' it shall reply, 'I was made from that joy so that I may help you and offer you company in your loneliness.'"

It has been narrated that Abu Ja'far and Abu 'Abd Allah both said: On the Day of Resurrection, when a believing servant comes before Allah, He will account him with an easy accounting but then reproach him saying, 'O believer, what stopped you from visiting Me when I was sick?' The believer shall reply, 'You are my Lord and I am Your servant; and You are ever-living and never afflicted with suffering or illness!' 'One who visits a believer in sickness has in fact visited Me,' shall say the Lord [M.G], 'Do you not know so-and-so?' 'Yes,' the believer shall reply, 'I know him.' Allah [M.G] shall then say, 'What stopped you from visiting him when he was sick? Had you visited him, you would have visited Me. Then you would have found Me ever-present at the time of your need. If you then would have asked me for any need, I would have fulfilled it for you and not turned you away from it.'"
