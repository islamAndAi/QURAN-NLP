Then he said to him: O servant of Allah, have you ever boarded a ship? He said: Yes. He said: Then, has it broken with you to the extent that no ship could save you, nor could swimming be sufficient for you? He said: Yes. He said: Then, did it, therein, connect to your heart that there is a thing among things that is able to save you from your hazard? He said: Yes.

We were told by Abu Muhammed, Ja’far bin Ali bin Ahmad, the jurist, al-Qommi and thereupon al-Eelaqi, may Allah be pleased with him, that he said: We were told by Abu Sa’eed, Abdan bin Fadl, that he said: I was told by Abu’l-Hasan, Muhammed bin Ya’qub bin Muhammed bin Yusuf bin Ja’far bin Ibrahim bin Muhammed bin Ali bin Abdullah bin Ja’far bin Abi Talib – in the city of Khujand – that he said: I was told by Abu Bakr, Muhammed bin Ahmad bin Shuja’ al-Farghani, that he said: I was told by Abu Muhammed, Hasan bin Hammad al-Anbari – in Egypt – that he said: I was told by Isma’il bin Abdul-Jalil al-Barqi, from Abu’l-Bukhturi, Wahab bin Wahab al-Qurashi, from Abu Abdillah al-Sadiq, Ja’far bin Muhammed, peace be upon him, that he said: Al-Baqir said: I was told by my father, Zain-ul-Abideen, from his father, Hussain bin Ali, peace be upon him, that he said: Al-Samad is He who has no interior, and al-Samad is He at whom sovereignty ends, and al-Samad is He who does not eat nor drink, and al-Samad is He who does not sleep, and al-Samad is He who has not perished and does not perish. Al-Baqir, peace be upon him, said: Muhammed bin Hanafiya – may Allah sanctify his soul – used to say: Al-Samad is He who is Upright by Himself, the Self-Sufficient from any other.» Another have said: Al-Samad is the Elevated above creation and termination, and al-Samad is He who is not characterized by change. Al-Baqir, peace be upon him, said: Al-Samad is the obeyed Master above whom there is no commander nor prohibitor. He said: Also, Ali bin Hussain, Zain-ul-Abideen, peace be upon him, was asked about al-Samad, so he said: Al-Samad is He who has no associate, nor is tired by preserving anything, nor is anything absent from Him. Wahab bin Wahab al-Qurashi said: Zaid bin Ali, peace be upon him, said: Al-Samad is He who if He wants something, He says to it: «Be», and it is, and al-Samad is who innovated things and created them in opposites, shapes and couples, and who unequaled Himself in Oneness with no opposite, nor shape, nor equal, nor rival. Also, Wahab bin Wahab al-Qurashi said: I heard al-Sadiq, peace be upon him, say: A delegation from Palestine came to al-Baqir, peace be upon him, and they asked him about matters, to which he answered, and then they asked him about al-Samad, so he said: Its interpretation: Al-Samad is of five letters. As for the Alif [1], it is a denotation that His Essential Existence, and that is His saying, Exalted and Glorious is He: «Allah witnessed that there is no god but Him» (3:18). In that is a reminder and indication to that which is absent from being perceivable by the senses. The Laam is a denotation that His Godness, that he is the God. Furthermore, the Alif and the Laam are diphthonged, and they do not appear (separately) on the tongue, and they are not heard (separately), and they appear in writing. They are two denotations that His Godness is, with His unmerited favor, hidden and not perceived by the senses, and that it does not come on the tongue of any describer, nor the ear of any hearer, because the interpretation of the God is He who protected the creation from comprehending His Essence and Nature by sense or by imagination. No, but rather, He is the Innovator of imaginations and Creator of senses. This only appears in writing as a denotation that Allah, Glorious is He, made apparent His Lordship by innovating the creation and forming their gentle souls into their solid bodies; so, if a servant looks at himself, he will not see his own soul, in similarity to how the Laam of al-Samad does not appear nor enter any sense of his five senses. However, when he looks at the writing, it appears to him what has been hidden and softened; so, whenever a servant ponders upon the Essence and Nature of the Maker, he will be exposed (to loss) and confused in it, and his imagination will not encompass anything that is imaginable of Him, because He, Exalted and Glorious is He, is the Creator of images. So, when he looks at His creation, it is affirmed to him that He, Exalted and Glorious is He, is their Creator and Former of their souls into their bodies. As for the Ssaad, it is a denotation that He, Exalted and Glorious is He, is Truthful, and that His saying is truth, and that His words are truth, and that He called His servants to follow the truth with the truth, and He promised with the truth, the World of Truth. As for the Miim, it is a denotation of His Kingdom, and that He, Exalted and Glorious is He, is the True King, that He did not perish nor does perish, nor does His Kingdom perish. As for the Daal, it is a denotation of the continuity of His Kingdom, and that He, Exalted and Glorious is He, is Everlasting, Exalted is He above creation and termination. Rather, He, Exalted and Glorious is He, is the Creator of the creations, by whose creation, every creature exists.»"

So, He made their satisfaction a satisfaction for Himself, and their anger an anger for Himself, and that is because He made them those who call to him and guide to him, and for that they became as such. It is not that this reaches Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, like how it reaches His creation, however, this is the meaning of what He said about that.

If it would be that for the Creator, it reaches grief and weariness, when He is the One who made them and created them, it would be possible for a sayer to say: Indeed, the Creator is to be annihilated one day, because if weariness and anger enter him, (it implies that) change enters him, and if change enters him, He cannot be secured from annihilation, and if it was as such, the Creator would not have been recognized from the created.

We were told by Muhammed bin Musa bin Mutawakkil, that he said: We were told by Ali bin Ibrahim bin Hashim, from his father, from Abbas bin Amru al-Fuqaymi, from Hisham bin Hakam, that a man asked Abu Abdillah, peace be upon him, about Allah, Blessed and Exalted is He, if He has satisfaction and anger. He said: Yes, and that is not like what exists in creatures, and that is because satisfaction and anger are penetrators that enter into him and change him from one condition to another condition. He is disordered, composed, and things have an entrance to him. Our Creator has no entrance for things into Him; He is One, One in essence, One in meaning. Hence, His satisfaction is His reward, and His anger is His punishment, without anything that interlaces Him by which it agitates Him and moves Him from one condition to another condition, for that is indeed the characteristic of the created, incapable, the needy. Whereas He, Blessed and Exalted, is the Strong and Mighty. He has no need for anything from what He created, and all His creation are needy of Him. He only created things out of no need nor cause, of invention and innovation."

He, peace be upon him, said: As for «Alif Laam Meem» at the beginning of al-Baqarah, it means: I am Allah, the King. As for «Alif Laam Meem» at the beginning of Aal Imran, it means: I am Allah, the Commendable. «Alif Laam Meem Ssaad» means: I am Allah, the Potent, the Truthful. «Alif Laam Raa’» means: I am Allah, the Compassionate. «Alif Laam Meem Raa’» means: I am Allah, the Giver of life, the Causer of death, the Sustainer. «Kaaf Haa’ Yaa’ ‘Ayn Ssaad» means: I am the Sufficient, the Guide, the Protector, the Knowledgeable, the Truthful in promise. As for «Taa’ Haa’», it is a name from the names of the Prophet, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, and it means: O he who seeks the truth, he who guides to it. «The Qur’an was not sent down unto you for you to be distressed» (20:1), but rather: for you to be glad with it [2]. As for «Taa’ Seen» it means: I am the Seeker, the All-Hearing. As for «Taa’ Seen Meem» it means: I am the Seeker, the All-Hearing, the Initiator, the Returner. As for «Yaa’ Seen» it is a name from the names of the Prophet, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, and it means: O he who hears the Revelation. «And by the Wise Qur’an. Indeed, you are certainly from the Messengers, upon the Straight Path.» (36:3-4) As for «Ssaad» it is a water source that springs from beneath the Throne, and it is from which the Prophet, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, made Wudu when it was journeyed with him. Jibra’eel [3], peace be upon him, enters into it every day and immerses into and then exits from, and then he shakes his wings. At then, there is no drop that drops from his wings, except that Allah, Blessed and Exalted is He, has created from it an Angel who glorifies Allah and sanctifies, declares Him Greater and praises Him till the Day of Resurrection. As for «Hhaa’ Meem» it means: The Praiseworthy, the Commendable. As for «Hhaa’ Meem ‘Ayn Seen Qaaf» it means: The All-Forbearing, the Rewarding, the Knowledgeable, the All-Hearing, the Powerful, the Strong. As for «Qaaf» it is the mountain that surrounds the earth and of which is the greenness of the sky, and by which Allah holds the earth from swaying with its inhabitants. As for «Nun» it is a river [46] in Paradise about which Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, said: «Freeze» and it froze and became ink. Then Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, said to the pen: «Write» and the Pen wrote on the Preserved Tablet what was and what will be till the Day of Resurrection. The Ink is of light, the Pen is a pen is of light and the Tablet is a tablet of light. And Sufyan said: So I said to him: O son of Allah’s Messenger, clarify to me the matter of the Tablet, the Pen and the Ink in bountiful clarification and teach me from what Allah has taught you. So he said: O son of Sa’d, were it not that you are deserving the answer, I would not have answered you. The «Nun» is an Angel who delivers to the Pen, who is an Angel, and the Pen delivers to the Tablet, who is an Angel, and the Tablet delivers to Israfeel [4], and Israfeel delivers to Mika’eel [5], and Mika’eel delivers to Jibra’eel, and Jibra’eel delivers to the Prophets and Messengers, upon whom are the blessings of Allah.

They said: Your matter has been of confusion to us, so we do not know what you have given! Then they stood up from him, and then Abu Yasir said to Hayee, his brother: What would you know? Perhaps for Muhammed, it has been gathered all of this and more than it. He said: Then Abu Ja’far, peace be upon him, mentioned that from these verses were sent down for their sake; among them are clear verses who are the Foundation of the Book, and others are not clear. He said: And they go in another direction, other than the interpretation of Hayee, Abu Yasir and their companions."
Maʿānī al-ʾAkhbār,The Meanings of Reports,,Shaykh Muḥammad b. ʿAlī al-Ṣaduq,Basel Kadem,"Maʿānī al-Akhbār, meaning ""The Meanings of Reports,"" is an essential compilation by the eminent Shīʿī scholar al-Shaykh al-Ṣadūq, renowned for his profound knowledge of Ḥadīth and jurisprudence. This scholarly work, completed in the fourth/tenth century, collects and elucidates approximately 500 terms from the Qurʾān, Ḥadīths, theology, jurisprudence, and other Islamic sciences, leveraging narratives from Prophet Muhammad (s) and the Ahl al-Bayt (a). Maʿānī al-Akhbār provides rich insights into various aspects of Islam, organised into five primary categories: Ḥadīths on Qurʾānic exegesis, jurisprudential Ḥadīths, theological, ethical, and historical Ḥadīths. The book comprises 809 Ḥadīths, arranged into 429 diverse sections, each shedding light on particular terminologies or concepts, ranging from widely recognized phrases to in-depth theological principles. Distinctive features of Maʿānī al-Akhbār include the author's rigorous scholarly approach to narrations, noting the time and location of some Hadith's transmission, and reference to lexicological experts' opinions. al-Shaykh al-Ṣadūq also articulates his theological arguments, referencing other sources, and often clarifying the true meaning of famous Sunnī Ḥadīths through Shīʿī chains of transmission. The book's unique focus on explaining ambiguities and problems within Ḥadīths, using the explanations provided from the Ahl al-Bayt's (as), is what sets it apart from other works. Maʿānī al-Akhbār is praised for its distinctive subject matter and methodology, offering unrivalled insight into understanding and interpreting key terms and concepts in Islamic sciences.",Section 1,Chapter 17 | The meaning of the separated letters at the beginning of the chapters of the Qur’an,Ḥadīth #4,"حدثنا محمد بن القاسم الاسترآبادي المعروف بأبي الحسن الجرجاني المفسر - رضي الله عنه - قال: حدثني أبو يعقوب يوسف بن محمد بن زياد، وأبو الحسن علي بن محمد بن سيار، عن أبويهما، عن الحسن بن علي بن محمد بن علي بن موسى بن جعفر بن محمد بن علي بن الحسين بن علي بن أبي طالب صلوات الله عليهم أجمعين أنه قال: كذبت قريش واليهود بالقرآن وقالوا: سحر مبين تقوله، فقال الله: "" ألم ذلك الكتاب "" أي يا محمد هذا الكتاب الذي أنزلناه عليك هو الحروف المقطعة التي منها "" الف، لام، ميم "" وهو بلغتكم وحروف هجائكم فأتوا بمثله إن كنتم صادقين واستعينوا على ذلك بسائر شهدائكم، ثم بين أنهم لا يقدرون عليه بقوله: "" قل لئن اجتمعت الإنس والجن على أن يأتوا بمثل هذا القرآنلا يأتون بمثله ولو كان بعضهم لبعض ظهيرا ثم قال الله: "" ألم "" هو القرآنالذي افتتح ب‍ "" ألم "" هو "" ذلك الكتاب "" الذي أخبرت به موسى فمن بعده الأنبياء فأخبروا بني إسرائيل أن سأنزل عليك يا محمد كتابا عزيزا "" لا يأتيه الباطل من بين يديه ولا من خلفه تنزيل من حكيم حميد "" "" لا ريب فيه "" لا شك فيه لظهوره عندهم كما أخبرهم به أنبياؤهم أن محمدا ينزل عليه كتاب لا يمحوه الباطل، يقرؤه هو وأمته على سائر أحوالهم "" هدى "" بيان من الضلالة "" للمتقين "" الذين يتقون الموبقات ويتقون تسليط السفه على أنفسهم حتى إذا علموا ما يجب عليهم علمه عملوا بما يوجب لهم رضا ربهم. قال: وقال الصادق عليه السلام: ثم "" الألف "" حرف من حروف قول الله دل بالألف على قولك الله و دل باللام على قولك الملك العظيم القاهر للخلق أجمعين، ودل بالميم على أنه المجيد المحمود في كل أفعاله وجعل هذا القول حجة على اليهود وذلك أن الله لما بعث موسى بن عمران ثم من بعده من الأنبياء إلى بني إسرائيل لم يكن فيهم أحد إلا أخذوا عليهم العهود و المواثيق ليؤمنن بمحمد العربي الأمي المبعوث بمكة الذي يهاجر إلى المدينة، يأتي بكتاب من الحروف المقطعة افتتاح بعض سوره، يحفظه أمته فيقرؤنه قياما وقعودا و مشاة وعلى كل الأحوال يسهل الله عز وجل حفظه عليهم ويقرنون بمحمد صلى الله عليه وآله أخاه ووصيه علي بن أبي طالب عليه السلام الاخذ عنه علومه التي علمها، والمتقلد عنه لأمانة التي قدرها ، ومذلل كل من عاند محمد صلى الله عليه وآله بسيفه الباتر ويفحم كل من جادله وخاصمه بدليله الظاهر يقاتل عباد الله على تنزيل كتاب الله حتى يقودهم إلى قبوله طائعين وكارهين، ثم إذا صار محمد صلى الله عليه وآله إلى رضوان الله عز وجل وارتد كثير ممن كان أعطاه ظاهر الايمان وحرفوا تأويلاته وغيروا معانيه ووضعوها على خلاف وجوهها قاتلهم بعد [ذلك] على تأويله حتى يكون إبليس الغاوي لهم هو الخاسر الذليل المطرود المغلول . قال: فلما بعث الله محمدا وأظهره بمكة ثم سيره منها إلى المدينة وأظهره بها، ثم أنزل إليه الكتاب وجعل افتتاح سورته الكبرى ب‍ "" ألم "" يعني "" ألم ذلك الكتاب "" وهو ذلك الكتاب الذي أخبرت أنبيائي السالفين أني سأنزله عليك يا محمد، "" لا ريب فيه "" فقد ظهر كما أخبرهم به أنبياؤهم أن محمدا ينزل عليه كتاب مبارك لا يمحوه الباطل، يقرؤه هو وأمته على سائر أحوالهم، ثم اليهود يحرفونه عن جهته، ويتأولونه على غير وجهه، ويتعاطون التوصل إلى علم ما قد طواه الله عنهم من حال آجال هذه الأمة وكم مدة ملكهم، فجاء إلى رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله منهم جماعة، فولى رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله عليا عليه السلام فخاطبهم، فقال قائلهم: إن كان ما يقول محمد - صلى الله عليه وآله - حقا لقد علمناكم قدر ملك أمته، هو إحدى وسبعون سنة، "" الألف "" واحد، و "" اللام "" ثلاثون، و "" الميم "" أربعون، فقال علي عليه السلام: فما تصنعون ب‍ "" المص "" وقد انزل عليه؟ قالوا: هذه إحدى وستون ومائة سنة. قال: فما ذا تصنعون ب‍ "" الر "" وقد أنزلت عليه؟ فقالوا: هذه أكثر، هذه مائتان وإحدى وثلاثون سنة. فقال علي عليه السلام: فما تصنعون بما انزل عليه "" المر ""؟ قالوا: هذه مائتان وإحدى وسبعون سنة فقال علي عليه السلام: فواحدة من هذه له أو جميعها له؟ فاختلط كلامهم فبعضهم قال له: واحدة منها وبعضهم قال: بل يجمع له كلها وذلك سبعمائة وأربع وثلاثون سنة، ثم يرجع الملك إلينا يعني إلى اليهود. فقال علي عليه السلام: أكتاب من كتب الله نطق بها، أم آراؤكم دلتكم عليه؟ قال بعظهم: كتاب الله نطق به، وقال آخرون منهم: بل آراؤنا دلت عليه، فقال علي عليه السلام. فأتوا بالكتاب من عند الله ينطق بما تقولون. فعجزوا عن إيراد ذلك، وقال للآخرين: فدلونا على صواب هذا الرأي. فقال: صواب رأينا دليله أن هذا حساب الجمل. فقال علي عليه السلام: كيف دل على ما تقولون وليس في هذه الحروف إلا ما اقترحتم بلا بيان! أرأيتم إن قيل لكم: إن هذه الحروف ليست دالة على هذه المدة لملك أمة محمد ولكنها دالة على أن كل واحد منكم قد لعن بعدد هذا الحساب أو أن عدد ذلك لكل واحد منكم ومنا بعدد هذا الحساب دراهم أو دنانير أو أن لعلي على كل واحد منكم دين عدد ماله مثل عدد هذا الحساب قالوا: يا أبا الحسن ليس شئ مما ذكرته منصوصا عليه في "" ألم "" و "" المص "" و "" الر "" و "" المر "". فقال علي عليه السلام: ولا شئ مما ذكرتموه منصوص عليه في "" ألم "" و "" المص "" و "" الر "" و "" المر "" فإن بطل قولنا لما قلنا بطل قولك لما قلت، فقال خطيبهم ومنطيقهم لا تفرح يا علي بأن عجزنا عن إقامة حجة فيما تقولهن على دعوانا فأي حجة لك في دعواك؟ إلا أن تجعل عجزنا حجتك، فإذا ما لنا حجة فيما نقول ولا لكم حجة فيما تقولون. قال علي عليه السلام لا سواء إن لنا حجة هي المعجزة الباهرة، ثم نادى جمال اليهود: يا أيتها الجمال أشهدي لمحمد ولوصيه. فتبادر الجمال: صدقت صدقت، يا وصي محمد وكذب هؤلاء اليهود فقال علي عليه السلام هؤلاء جنس من الشهود، يا ثياب اليهود التي عليهم: أشهدي لمحمد و لوصيه. فنطقت ثيابهم كلها: صدقت صدقت يا علي نشهد أن محمد رسول الله حقا، وأنك يا علي وصيه حقا، لم يثبت محمدا قدما في مكرمة إلا وطأت على موضع قدمه بمثل مكرمته وأنتما شقيقان من اشراق أنوار الله فميزتما اثنين وأنتما في الفضائل شريكان إلا أنه لا نبي بعد محمد صلى الله عليه وآله. فعند ذلك خرست اليهود وآمن بعض النظارة منهم برسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله فغلب الشقاء على اليهود وسائر النظارة الآخرين، فذلك ما قال الله: "" لا ريب فيه "" إنه كما قال محمد صلى الله عليه وآله ووصي محمد عن قول محمد صلى الله عليه وآله عن قول رب العالمين ثم قال: "" هدى "" بيان وشفاء "" للمتقين "" من شيعة محمد وعلي إنهم اتقوا أنواع الكفر فتركوها واتقوا الذنوب الموبقات فرفضوها واتقوا إظهار أسرار الله وأسرار أزكياء عباده الأوصياء بعد محمد صلى الله عليه وآله فكتموها واتقوا ستر العلوم عن أهلها المستحقين لها وفيهم نشروها.","4. We were told by Muhammed bin Qasim al-Esterabadi, known as Abu’l-Hasan al-Jarjani, the Exegetist, may Allah be pleased with him, that he said: I was told by Abu Ya’qub, Yusuf bin Muhammed bin Ziyad, and Abu’l-Hasan, Ali bin Muhammed bin Sayyar, from their fathers, from Hasan bin Ali bin Abi Talib, Allah’s blessings be upon them all, that he said: Quraish and the Jews rejected the Qur’an, and they said: A clear magic that he has uttered. Then Allah said: «Alif Laam Meem. That Book» meaning: O Muhammed, this book that We have sent down unto you is the segmented letters among which are «Alif Laam Meem», which is in your language and the letters of your alphabet, hence, bring an equal to it if you are truthful, and seek assistance for that from the rest of your witnesses. Then he clarified that they are not able to it, with His saying: «Say: Certainly, if the humans and the jinns were to gather to bring an equal to this Qur’an, they will not bring an equal to it, even if they were to each other, assistants.» (17:88) Then Allah said: «Alif Laam Meem». The Qur’an that was opened with «Alif Laam Meem», it is «That Book» which was informed of by Musa [1] and those after him of Prophets; they informed the sons of Isra’eel that I will send down unto you, O Muhammed, a Mighty Book «whom falsehood does not come from between its hands nor from behind it; a Revelation from an All-Wise, an All-Praiseworthy» (41:42). «In which there is no doubt», in which there is no doubt, due to its appearance among them, like how they were informed by their Prophets that upon Muhammed the Book shall be sent down. It will not be erased by falsehood; it will be read by him and his nation on the rest of their conditions. «A guidance» clear from aberration «to the godfearing» who guard against grave sins and guard against granting control of foolishness upon themselves, until they are knowledgeable of what is obligatory upon them to know, they act by what brings them the satisfaction of their Lord. He said: Al-Sadiq, peace be upon him, said: The «Alif» is a letter from the letters of the saying: Allah. With the «Alif» He denoted your saying: Allah. And with the «Laam» He denoted your saying: The Great King, the Vanquisher of the creation, all of them. With the «Meem» He denoted that He is the Commendable, the Praised, in all all His acts, and He made this saying a proof upon the Jews. That is because when Allah sent Musa bin Imran [2], and then after him the Prophets to the sons of Isra’eel, there was none among them except that they took upon them oaths and covenants that they will certainly believe in Muhammed, the Arab, the Ummi [3] who will be sent in Mecca, who will migrate to Medina, who will bring a Book consisting of segmented letters as an opening to some of its chapters. His nation will preserve it, and they will read it while standing, sitting, walking and in all conditions. Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, will make its memorizing easy upon them. They will equal to Muhammed, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, his brother and Successor, Ali bin Abi Talib, peace be upon him, the one who takes from him his knowledge that he knew, and who takes on his behalf the trust that he was entrusted, and the humiliator of everyone who was adamant towards Muhammed, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, with his cutting sword, and who overwhelms everyone who argues against him and opposes him with his manifest proof. He will fight the servants of Allah over the revelation of the Book of Allah until he leads them to accept it, willingly or forcibly. Then, when Muhammed, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, will move to the satisfaction of Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, and it will apostatize many from those who granted him apparent faith, and they alter his interpretations, change its meanings and place them on the contrary of their indications, he will fight them after over its interpretation, until Iblees, their seducer, is the looser, the humiliated, the banished, the chained. He said: Then, when Allah sent Muhammed and made him appear in Mecca, then made him march from it to Medina and made him appear in it, then sent down the Book unto him and made the opening of its greatest chapter with «Alif Laam Meem», meaning «Alif Laam Meem. That Book» which is that Book whom My previous Prophets informed that I will send down unto you, O Muhammed «in which there is no doubt» it appeared like how they were informed by their Prophets that upon Muhammed there will be sent down a Blessed Book which falsehood will not erase, which will be read by him and his nation on the rest of their conditions. Then, the Jews attempted to alter it from its direction and interpret it differently than its indication, and they pursued to reach a knowledge that Allah has not folded from them with regards to the conditions of the time of this nation and the duration of their reign. So, a group of them came to the Messenger of Allah, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, and the Messenger of Allah, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, assigned Ali, peace be upon him, so he addressed them. Their speaker said: If what Muhammed, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family [4], says is true, then we will teach you the duration of his nation’s reign. It is seventy one years; the «Alif» is one, the «Laam» is thirty and the «Meem» is forty. Then Ali, peace be upon him, said: So what do you do with «Alif Laam Meem Ssaad» which has been sent down unto him? Then they said: These are more; they are two hundred and thirty one years. Then Ali, peace be upon him, said: So what do you do with what has been sent down unto him of «Alif Laam Meem Raa’»? They said: These are two hundred and seventy one years. Then Ali, peace be upon him, said: So, is one of these for him, or are they all for him? Their word differed, and so some of them said to him: One of them. And others said: Rather, all shall be calculated for him, and that will be seven hundred and thirty four years, and then the reign will return to us, meaning to the Jews. Then Ali, peace be upon him, said: Has a Book from the Books of Allah spoken this, or did your reasoning lead you to it? Some of them said: The Book of Allah spoke it. Others of them said: Rather, our reasoning lead to it. Then Ali, peace be upon him, said: Then bring the Book that is from Allah which speaks what you say. Then they were unable to bring that. And he said to the others: Then lead us to the validity of this reasoning. He said: The validity of our opinion, its proof is that this is the camel’s calculation. Then Ali, peace be upon him, said: How did it lead to what you say, when there is not in these letters except that which you suggested without evidence? Would you imagine if it was said to you: These letters do not denote the duration of the reign of Muhammed’s nation, but they denote that everyone of you has been cursed by the amount of this calculation, or for each one of you and us is as the mount of this calculation in dirhams and dinars, or that Ali has upon each one of you a debt whose amount of money is like the amount of this calculation? They said: O Aba’l-Hasan, none of what you mentioned is confirmed in «Alif Laam Meem», «Alif Laam Meem Ssaad», «Alif Laam Raa’» and «Alif Laam Meem Raa’». Then Ali, peace be upon him, said: And nothing from what you mentioned is confirmed in «Alif Laam Meem», «Alif Laam Meem Ssaad», «Alif Laam Raa’» and «Alif Laam Meem Raa’». Hence, if our saying is invalid due to what we said, then your saying is invalid due to what you said. Then their speaker and eloquent said: Do not rejoice, O Ali, that we were unable to establish a proof in what you said about our claim, for what proof do you have of your claim? Unless you make our inability your proof. Hence, we have no proof of what we say, and you have no proof of what you say. Ali, peace be upon him, said: They are not the same. Indeed, we have a proof, that is the dazzling miracle. Then he called to the camels of the Jews: O camels, testify for Muhammed and his Successor. Then the camels initiated: You spoke true, you spoke true, O Successor of Muhammed, and these Jews have lied. Then Ali, peace be upon him said: These are a part of the witnesses. O clothes of the Jews which are on them, testify for Muhammed and his Successor. Then all the clothes spoke: You spoke true, you spoke true, O Ali, we testify that Muhammed is truly the Messenger of Allah, and that you, O Ali, is truly his Successor; Muhammed stepped into no noble quality except that you stepped on his footstep with his same noble quality. You are two brothers from the radiance of the Lights of Allah, after which you were made distinct into two, and you are associates in virtues, except that there is no prophet after Muhammed, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family. Therein, the Jews were silent, and some of their attendants believed in the Messenger of Allah, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family. Then wretchedness dominated the Jews and the rest of the other attendants. That is about which Allah said: «in which there is no doubt». It is as was said by Muhammed, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, and the Successor of Muhammed about the saying of Muhammed, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, about the saying of the Lord of all the worlds. Then he said: «a guidance» is a clarification and a remedy «to the godfearing» from the Shi’a of Muhammed and Ali; they guarded against the various types of disbelief, and so they abandoned them, and they guarded against grieve sins, and so they rejected them, and they guarded against demonstrating the secrets of Allah and the secrets of his pure servants, the Successors after Muhammed, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, and so they concealed them, and they guarded against veiling knowledge from its people who deserve it, and they spread it among them."

We were told by Muhammed bin Qasim al-Esterabadi, the Exegetist, that he said: I was told by Yusuf bin Muhammed bin Ziyad, and Ali bin Muhammed bin Sayyar, from their fathers, from Hasan bin Ali bin Muhammed bin Ali bin Musa bin Ja’far bin Muhammed bin Ali bin Hussain bin Ali bin Abi Talib, peace be upon them, with regards to His saying: «Guide us the Straight Path», that he said: Maintain to us Your success by which we have obeyed You in the past of our days that we might obey you, likewise, in the future of our ages. The Straight Path is two Paths: a Path in this world, and a Path in the Hereafter. As for the Straight Path in this world, it is what has shortened beneath exaggeration, arisen above short-coming and become straight by which it does not deviate to anything of falsehood. As for the other Way, it is the Way of the believers to Paradise, which is straight; they do not deviate from Paradise to the Fire, nor to other than the Fire, but to Paradise. He said: Ja’far bin Muhammed al-Sadiq, peace be upon them both, said with regards to His saying, Exalted and Glorious is He: «Guide us the Straight Path». He said: He says: Direct us to the Straight Path, direct us to adherence to the Way that leads to Your love, the transmitter to Your Religion and the impediment from making us follow our desires, lest we become impaired, or making us follow our opinion, lest we perish. Then he, peace be upon him, said: Indeed, the one who follows his desire and is admired by his own opinion, will be like a man whom I have heard the populace’s waste material magnify and ridicule. I wanted to meet him in a manner that he does not recognize me, that I might see his value and position. I saw that he was surrounded by many people from the populace’s waste material, and I stood in withdrawal from them, covered with a veil, looking at him and them, and he continued to elude them until he went in an opposing direction, separated from them and did not stay, after which the populace dispersed from him to their needs. I followed him, tracing his steps, and he did not stay but that he passed by a baker, distracted him and took from his shop two loafs in theft, and so I was amazed by him, and then I said in myself: Perhaps it was a transaction? Then after it, he passed by an owner of pomegranates, and he remained with him until he distracted him and took from him two pomegranates in theft, and so I was amazed by him, and then I said in myself: Perhaps it was a transaction? Then I said: What need does he have for theft then? I kept following him until he passed by an ill person and placed the two loafs and the two pomegranates between his hands and went. I followed him until he dwelled in an area of the desert, and I said to him: O servant of Allah, I have heard of you and wanted to meet you, and so I saw you, but I saw from you what distressed my heart, and I will ask you about it, so that the distress of my heart vanishes. He said: What is it? I said: I saw you passing by a baker and you stole two loafs from him, then by the owner of pomegranates and you stole two pomegranates from him. He said: Then he said to me: Before everything, tell me, who are you? I said: A man from the sons of Adam, peace be upon him, from the nation of Muhammed, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family. He said: Tell me, who are you? I said: A man from the Household of Allah’s Messenger, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family. He said: Where is your country? I said: Medina. He said: Perhaps you are Ja’far bin Muhammed bin Ali bin Hussain bin Ali bin Abi Talib, Allah’s blessings be upon them? I said: Sure. Then he said to me: So what does the nobility of your origin benefit you with your ignorance of what you have been honored with and your abandonment of the knowledge of your grandfather and father with regards to not rebuke that whose doer must be praised and commended for? I said: What is it? He said: The Qur’an, the Book of Allah! I said: What thing have I been ignorant of from it? He said: The saying of Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He: «Whoever comes with a good deed, will have ten the likes thereof, and whoever comes with a misdeed, will not be rewarded except the like thereof» (6:160) When I stole the two loafs, they were two misdeeds, and then I stole the two pomegranates, they were two misdeeds. So, these are four misdeeds, and when I gave each one of them as charity, I had forty good deeds with them. So, reduce from the forty good deeds, four, due to four misdeeds, and it remains to me thirty six good deeds. I said: May your mother mourn you! You are the ignorant of the Book of Allah. Have you not heard that He, Exalted and Glorious is He, says: «He only accepts from the godfearing» (5:27)? When you stole two loafs, they were two misdeeds, and when you stole two pomegranates, they were also two misdeeds, and when you gave them to other than their owners without the order of their owners, then you would only have added four misdeeds onto four misdeeds, and you would not have added forty good deeds onto four misdeeds. Then he kept glancing at me, so I went and left him. Al-Sadiq, peace be upon him, said: With such a horrid, disliked, interpretation they are aberrated and they aberrate. This is similar to the interpretation of Mu’awiya, may Allah curse him, when Ammar bin Yasir, may Allah grant him mercy, was killed, the shoulders flanks of many people shivered and they said: The Messenger of Allah, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, said: Ammar will be killed by the transgressing faction. Therein, Amru entered into Mu’awiya, may Allah curse him, and said: O Commander of the Believers, the people have become agitated and disordered. He said: Why? He said: The killing of Ammar. Then Mu’awiya, may Allah curse him, said: The killing of Ammar, then what? He said: Did not Allah’s Messenger, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family [2], say: Ammar will be killed by the transgressing faction? Then Mu’awiya, may Allah curse him, said to him: You are revoked with your saying. Did we kill him? He was only killed by Ali bin Abi Talib when he threw him between our spears! Then this reached Ali bin Abi Talib, peace be upon him, and he said: Hence, the Messenger of Allah, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, would have been the one who killed Hamza when he threw him between the spears of the polytheists! Then al-Sadiq, peace be upon him, said: Tuba [3] is for those who are like the Messenger of Allah, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, said: This knowledge will be carried from every successor, by an enemy of him, and they will negate from it the alteration of the exaggerators, the assumption of the undue and the interpretation of the ignorant ones."

We were told by Muhammed bin Qasim al-Esterabadi, the Exegetist, that he said: I was told by Yusuf bin Muhammed bin Ziyad, and Ali bin Muhammed bin Sayyar, from their fathers, from Hasan bin Ali bin Muhammed bin Ali bin Musa ibn Ja’far bin Muhammed bin Ali bin Hussain bin Ali bin Abi Talib, peace be upon them, with regards to the saying of Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He: «The Path of those upon whom You have bestowed favor» means (that you shall) say: Guide us the Path of those upon whom You have bestowed favor by granting success to Your Religion and obedience, and they are those about whom Allah, Exalted and Glorious, said: «And whoever obeys Allah and the Messenger, they are with those upon whom Allah has bestowed favor, from the Prophets, the Truthful, the martyrs and the righteous. And excellent are those as companions.» (4:70) Exactly this was also reported of the Commander of the Believers, peace be upon him, that he said: It is not those upon whom it has been bestowed with favors of money and health in bodies, although all this is an apparent grace from Allah. Do you not see that these might be disbelievers or grieve sinners? You were not called to pray that you are directed to their path, but rather, you were ordered to pray that you are directed to the Path of those upon whom Allah has bestowed with the favors of faith in Allah, belief in His Messenger and befriendship to Muhammed and his Pure Family and his good, noble, companions, and of righteous Taqiya by which safety is granted from the evil among Allah’s servants and from increasement of the evil deeds and disbelief of Allah’s enemies, by being affable with them and not impute them for harming you and harming the believers, and by knowing the rights of the brothers among the believers. Verily, there is no servant nor maid who befriends Muhammed and the Family of Muhammed, peace be upon them, and antagonizes those who antagonized them, except that he took from the torment of Allah a protective shield. And there is no servant nor slave who appeased the servants of Allah and did well in appeasement by which he did not enter into any falsehood and not deviate from any truth, except that Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, makes his breathing a glorification, purifies his deeds and gives an insight to conceal our secret and patience with anger due to what he hears from our enemies, like the reward of the one smeared with his blood for the sake of Allah. And there is no servant who takes himself to carry out the rights of his brothers, fulfills their rights effortfully, gives them what is possible for him and is satisfied with them by pardoning them and abandoning the investigation into them with regards to what happens of their errors, and who forgivest hem for it, except that Allah says to him on the Day he meets Him: O my servant, you fulfilled the rights of your brothers, and you did not investigate into them with regards to that which they owe you. Hence, I am more Munificent and Generous and Prior of what you did of pardoning and generosity, so, I will today, indeed, fulfil a right I promised you and increase from My wide favor, and I will not look into you with regards to your short-coming with some of My rights. He said: Then He will joint hem with Muhammed and his Family and make him among the best of their Shi’a. Then he said: The Messenger of Allah, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, said to some of his companions one day: O servant of Allah, love for the sake of Allah, hate for the sake of Allah, befriend for the sake of Allah, antagonize for the sake of Allah, for indeed, the befriendship of Allah cannot be attained except by such, and a man will not find the taste of faith, even if his prayers and fasts augment, until he becomes as such. Indeed, the fraternity among people has, on this day of yours, has mostly become for the sake of this world; for its sake they affectionate, and for its sake they antagonize, and that will not avail them from Allah at all. Then the man said: O Messenger of Allah, how can I know that I have befriended and antagonized for the sake of Allah, and who is the Ally of Allah, that I may befriend him? And who is his enemy, that I may antagonize him? Then the Messenger of Allah, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, pointed towards Ali, peace be upon him, and said: Do you see him? He said: Sure. He said: The ally of his is the ally of Allah, so befriend him, and the enemy of his is the enemy of Allah, so antagonize him, and befriend the ally of his, even if he has fought your father and sons, and antagonize the enemy of his, even if he is your father or sons."

فلقوله "" الله أكبر "" معان كثيرة منها أن قول المؤذن: "" الله أكبر "" يقع على قدمه وأزليته وأبديته وعلمه وقوته وقدرته وحلمه وكرمه وجوده وعطائه وكبريائه. فإذا قال المؤذن "" الله أكبر "" فإنه يقول: الله الذي له الخلق والامر و بمشيته كان الخلق، ومنه كل شئ للخلق، وإليه يرجع الخلق، وهو الأول قبل كل شئ لم يزل، والآخر بعد كل شئ لا يزال، والظاهر فوق كل شئ لا يدرك، والباطن دون كل شئ لا يحد، وهو الباقي وكل شئ دونه فان. والمعنى الثاني: الله أكبر، أي العليم الخبير عليهم بما كان ويكون قبل أن يكون. والثالث: الله أكبر، أي القادر على كل شئ يقدر على ما يشاء، القوي لقدرته، المقتدر على خلقه، القوي لذاته، قدرته قائمة على الأشياء كلها، إذا قضى أمرا فإنما يقول له كن فيكون. والرابع: الله أكبر، على معنى حلمه وكرمه، يحلم كأنه لا يعلم، ويصفح كأنه لا يرى، ويستر كأنه لا يعصى، لا يعجل بالعقوبة كرما وصفحا وحلما. والوجه الآخر في معنى "" الله أكبر "" أي الجواد جزيل العطاء كريم الفعال. والوجه الآخر الله أكبر فيه نفي صفته وكيفيته كأنه يقول: الله أجل من أن يدرك الواصفون قدر صفته الذي هو موصوف به، وإنما يصفه الواصفون على قدرهم لا على قدر عظمته وجلاله، تعالى الله عن أن يدرك الواصفون صفته علوا كبيرا. والوجه الآخر "" الله أكبر "" كأنه يقول: الله أعلى وأجل، وهو الغني عن عباده، لا حاجة به إلى أعمال خلقه. وأما قوله: "" أشهد أن لا إله إلا الله "" فإعلام بأن الشهادة لا تجوز إلا بمعرفته من القلب كأنه يقول: أعلم أنه لا معبود إلا الله عز وجل وأن كل معبود باطل سوى الله عز وجل وأقر بلساني بما في قلبي من العلم بأنه لا إله إلا الله وأشهد أنه لا ملجأ من الله إلا إليه ولا منجا من شر كل ذي شر وفتنة كل ذي فتنة إلا بالله. وفي المرة الثانية "" أشهد أن لا إله إلا الله "" معناه: أشهد أن لا هادي إلا الله ولا دليل لي إلى الدين إلا الله و اشهد الله بأني أشهد أن لا إله إلا الله واشهد سكان السماوات وسكان والأرضين وما فيهن من الملائكة والناس أجمعين وما فيهن من الجبال والأشجار والدواب والوحوش وكل رطب ويابس بأني أشهد أن لا خالق إلا الله ولا رازق ولا معبود ولا ضار ولا نافع ولا قابض ولا باسط ولا معطي ولا مانع ولا ناصح ولا كافي ولا شافي ولا مقدم ولا مؤخر إلا الله، له الخلق والامر، وبيده الخير كله، تبارك الله رب العالمين. وأما قوله: "" أشهد أن محمدا رسول الله "" يقول: اشهد الله أنه لا إله إلا هو وأن محمدا ع��ده ورسوله ونبيه وصفيه ونجيه أرسله إلى كافة الناس أجمعين بالهدى ودين الحق ليظهره على الدين كله ولو كره المشركون، واشهد من في السماوات والأرض من النبيين والمرسلين والملائكة والناس أجمعين أن محمدا سيد الأولين والآخرين. وفي المرة الثانية "" أشهد أن محمدا رسول الله "" يقول: أشهد أن لا حاجة لأحد [إلى أحد] إلا إلى الله الواحد القهار الغني عن عباده والخلائق والناس أجمعين، وأنه أرسل محمدا إلى الناس بشيرا ونذيرا وداعيا إلى الله بإذنه وسراجا منيرا، من أنكره وجحده ولم يؤمن به أدخله الله عز وجل نار جهنم خالدا مخلدا لا ينفك عنها أبدا. وأما قوله: "" حي على الصلاة "" أي هلموا إلى خير أعمالكم ودعوة ربكم، وسارعوا إلى مغفرة من ربكم، وإطفاء ناركم التي أوقدتموها، وفكاك رقابكم التي رهنتموها، ليكفر الله عنكم سيئاتكم، ويغفر لكم ذنوبكم، ويبدل سيئاتكم حسنات، فإنه ملك كريم ذو الفضل العظيم، وقد أذن لنا معاشر المسلمين بالدخول في خدمته، والتقدم إلى بين يديه. وفي المرة الثانية "" حي على الصلاة "" أي قوموا إلى مناجاة الله ربكم، وعرض حاجاتكم على ربكم، وتوسلوا إليه بكلامه، وتشفعوا به، وأكثروا الذكر والقنوت والركوع والسجود والخضوع والخشوع، وارفعوا إليه حوائجكم، فقد أذن لنا في ذلك. وأما قوله: "" حي على الفلاح "" فإنه يقول: أقبلوا إلى بقاء لا فناء معه، ونجاة لا هلاك معها، وتعالوا إلى حياة لا موت معها، وإلى نعيم لا نفاد له، وإلى ملك لا زوال عنه، وإلى سرور لا حزن معه، وإلى أنس لا وحشة معه، وإلى نور لا ظلمةمعه، وإلى سعة لا ضيق معها، وإلى بهجة لا انقطاع لها، وإلى غنى لا فاقة معه، وإلى صحة لا سقم معها، [وإلى عز لا ذل معه] وإلى قوة لا ضعف معها، وإلى كرامة يا لها من كرامة، واعجلوا إلى سرور الدنيا والعقبى، ونجاة الآخرة والأولى. وفي المرة الثانية "" حي على الفلاح "" فإنه يقول: سابقوا إلى ما دعوتكم إليه، وإلى جزيل الكرامة، وعظيم المنة، وسني النعمة، و الفوز العظيم، ونعيم الأبد في جوار محمد صلى الله عليه وآله في مقعد صدقعند مليك مقتدر. وأما قوله "" الله أكبر "" فإنه بقول: الله أعلى وأجل من أن يعلم أحد من خلقه ما عنده من الكرامة لعبد أجابه وأطاعه وأطاع أمره وعبده وعرف وعيده واشتغل به وبذكره وأحبه وآمن به واطمأن إليه ووثق به وخافه ورجاه واشتاق إليه ووافقه في حكمه وقضائه ورضي به. وفي المرة الثانية "" الله أكبر "" فإنه يقول: الله أكبر وأعلى وأجل من أن يعلم أحد مبلغ كرامته لأوليائه وعقوبته لأعدائه ومبلغ عفوه وغفرانه ونعمته لمن أجابه وأجاب رسوله، ومبلغ عذابه ونكاله وهو انه لمن أنكره وجحده. وأما قوله "" لا إله إلا الله "" معناه: لله الحجة البالغة عليهم بالرسول والرسالة و البيان والدعوة، وهو أجل من أن يكون لأحد منهم عليه حجة، فمن أجابه فله النور والكرامة، [ومن أنكره] فإن الله غني عن العالمين، وهو أسرع الحاسبين. ومعني "" قد قامت الصلاة "" في الإقامة أي حان وقت الزيارة والمناجاة وقضاء الحوائج ودرك المنى والوصول إلى الله عز وجل وإلى كرامته وعفوه ورضوانه وغفرانه.","1. We were told by Ahmad bin Muhammed bin Abdul-Rahman al-Maruzi, the Magran ruler, that he said: We were told by Abu Amru, Muhammed bin Ja’far al-Miqri al-Jarjani, that he said: We were told by Abu Bakr, Muhammed bin Hasan al-Mosuli in Baghdad, that he said: We were told by Muhammed bin ‘Asim al-Turayfi, that he said: We were told by Abu Zaid, Abbas bin Yazid bin Hasan, the cameleer, the servant of Zaid bin Ali, that he said: I was informed by my father, Yazid bin Hasan, that he said: I was told by Musa ibn Ja’far bin Muhammed, from his father, Muhammed bin Ali, from his father, Ali bin Hussain, from his father, Hussain bin Ali bin Abi Talib, peace be upon them, that he said: We were sitting in the Mosque, and the muezzin climbed up the minaret and said: Allah is Greater, Allah is Greater. Then the Commander of the Believers, Ali bin Abi Talib, peace be upon him, wept and we wept due to his weeping. When the muezzin was finished, he said: Do you comprehend what the muezzin says? We said: Allah, His Messenger and his Successor are more knowledgeable. He said: If you are to know what he says, you would certainly laugh a little and weep much. For his saying: «Allah is Greater» are many meanings, among which is that the muezzin’s saying: «Allah is Greater» implies His Ancientness, Eternity, Perpetuity, Knowledge, Strength, Ability, Forbearance, Generosity, Munificence, Bestowal and Solemnity. Hence, when the muezzin says: «Allah is Greater» then he is saying: Allah is He to whom belongs the creation and the commandment, and with His Volition the creation was, and from Him is everything to the creation, and to Him returns the creation. He is the first before everything, He was not perishing, and the Last after everything, He will not perish. He is the Dominant above everything, He may not be perceived, and the Inside beneath everything. He is the Remaining when everything except Him is to annihilate. The second meaning: Allah is Greater, meaning the Knowing, the Acquainted upon them, with regards to what was and what will be before it is. The third: Allah is Greater, meaning the Powerful over everything, He is Able to do what He wishes, the Strong due to His Strength, the Potent over His creation, the Strong in His Essence. His Ability is established upon all things; if He decides a matter, He only says to it: Be, and it is. Fourth: Allah is Greater, in the meaning of His Forbearance and Generosity, forbearing as if He is not known, pardoning as if He is not seen, veiling as if He is not disobeyed. He does not rush with a punishment, out of generosity, pardon and forbearance. Another indication of the meaning of «Allah is Greater» is the Munificent, giving in magnitude, the Generous in good deeds. Another indication of «Allah is Greater» is that it includes a negation of Him possessing a characteristic and a condition, such as if he is saying: Allah is More Glorious than for the describers to comprehend the degree of His characteristic. By which He is characterized, but that the describers only describe Him based upon their ability (of understanding), not based upon the degree of His Greatness and Glory, Exalted be Allah above the describers to be able to comprehend His characteristic, a Great Exaltation. Another indication of «Allah is Greater» is as if he is saying: Allah is Higher and More Glorious, and He is the Self-Sufficient from His servants, He has no need for the deeds of His creation. As for his saying: «I testify that there is no god but Allah» it is an announcement that the testimony is not possible unless by knowing Him from the heart, as if he is saying: I know that there is none to be worshipped except for Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, and that every worshipped is false except for Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, and I acknowledge with my tongue what is in my heart of knowledge that there is no god but Allah, and I testify that there is no refuge from Allah except to Himself, and there is no escape from the evil of every evil and the affliction of every affliction except by Allah. At the second time «I testify that there is no god but Allah» means: I testify that there is no guide except for Allah, and there is no guide for me to Religion except for Allah, and I testify before Allah that I testify that there is no god but Allah, and I testify before the inhabitants of the Heavens and the inhabitants of the Earths, and what is in them of all the Angels and people, and what is in them of mountains, trees, cattle and beasts, and every moist and dry, that I testify that there is no creator except for Allah, and there is no sustainer, worshippers, harmer, helpful, taker, extender, granter, preventor, admonisher, sufficient, first nor last except for Allah, to Him belongs the creation and the order, and in His Hand is all good, Blessed be Allah, the Lord of all the worlds. As for his saying: «I testify that Muhammed is the Messenger of Allah» he is saying: I testify before Allah that there is no god but Him and that Muhammed is His Servant, Messenger, Prophet, Chosen and Confidant, whom He sent to the totality of people, all of them, with the guidance and the Religion of Truth, that He may make him victorious above all religion, even if the polytheists dislike it, and I testify before those in the Heavens and the earth of all the Prophets, Messengers, Angels and people that Muhammed is the Master of the first and the last. At the second time «I testify that Muhammed is the Messenger of Allah» he is saying: I testify that there is no need for anyone except for Allah, the One, the Vanquisher, the Self-Sufficient from all His servants, the creations and people, and that He sent Muhammed to the people as a bearer of glad tidings, warner and caller to Allah by His permission, and a brightening lamp; he who denies and rejects him knowingly and does not believe in him, Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, will enter him into the Fire of Hell, forever, made to abide, not being ever separated from it. As for his saying: «Hasten to prayer» it means: Come to the best of your deeds and the call of your Lord, and rush towards forgiveness from your Lord, the extinguishing of your fire which you have ignited, and the liberation of your necks which you have conditioned, that Allah might expiate from you your misdeeds, forgive you for your sins and replace your misdeeds with good deeds, for indeed, He is a Generous King, possessing Great Favor, and that He has permitted us, all the Muslims, to enter into His service and moving forward to between His Hands. At the second time of «Hasten to prayer» it means: Stand up to supplication to Allah, your Lord, the presentation of your needs before your Lord, and use His speech as a means to Him, and seek intercession with it, increase the remembrance (of Allah), Qunut [1], kneeling, prostration, subordination and submissiveness, and raise to Him your needs, for He has permitted that to us. As for his saying: «Hasten to success», he is saying: Come forward towards a remain after which there is no termination, and salvation with which there is no perishing, and come to a life with which there is no death, to a bliss that has no depletion, to a property from which there is no passing, to a joy with which there is no grief, to a company with which there is no loneliness, to a wealth with which there is no poverty, to a health with which there is no illness, to an honor with which there is no humility, to a strength with which there is no weakness, and to a dignity, how of a dignity is it, and rush towards the joy of this world and the Next, and the salvation of the Hereafter and the First. At the second time of «Hasten to success», he is saying: Precede to what I have called you to, and to the abundant dignification, the great favor, the lofty grace, the great winning, and the bliss of eternity in the vicinity of Muhammed, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, in a Seat of Honor near an All-Sovereign, Perfect in Ability. As for his saying: «Allah is Greater», he is saying: Allah is Higher and More Glorious than for anyone among His creation to know what He has of dignification towards a servant who responds to Him, obeys Him, obeys His commandment, worships Him, knows His threat, occupies himself with Him and His remembrance, loves Him, believes in Him, is assured towards Him, trusts Him, fears Him, seeks Him, misses Him, accords with Him in his ruling and judging and is pleased with Him. At the second time of «Allah is Greater», he is saying: Allah is Greater, Higher and More Glorious than for anyone to know the extent of His dignification of His allies and His punishment of His enemies, the extent of His pardoning, forgiveness and grace towards those who respond to Him and respond to His Messenger and the extent of His torment and exemplary punishment, and that it is for those who denied Him and rejected Him knowingly. As for his saying: «There is no god but Allah» it means: To Allah belongs the ultimate proof upon them, through the Messenger, the Message, the clarification and the call, and He is More Glorious than for anyone of them to have a proof against Him. Hence, he who responds to Him, to him is light and dignity, and he who denies him, then indeed, Allah is Self-Sufficient from all the worlds, and He is the Swiftest of Accountants. The meaning of «Verily, the prayer has been established» in the Iqamah means that the time has come for visitation, supplication, fulfillment of needs, attainment of wishes and reaching Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, and His dignification, pardoning, satisfaction and forgiveness."

Ibn Abbas said: When the muezzin says: «Allah is Greater, Allah is Greater» he is saying: O those who are occupied with the earth, verily, the prayer has become obligatory, so dedicate yourselves to it. When he says: «I testify that there is no god but Allah» he is saying: The Day of Resurrection will arise, and it will be testified for me by what is in the Heavens and what is in the earth that I have informed you five times a day. When he says: «I testify that Muhammed is the Messenger of Allah» he is saying: The Day of Resurrection will arise, and Muhammed will testify for me before you that I have, verily, informed you of that five times a day, and my argument with Allah is established. When he says: «Hasten to prayer» he is saying: [It is] A right religion, therefore, establish it. When he says: «Hasten to success» he is saying: Come forward to obedience of Allah and take your portion of Allah’s mercy, meaning congregation [1].

We were told by Muhammed bin Bakran al-Naqqash, may Allah grant him mercy, that he said: We were told by Ahmad bin Muhammed al-Hamdani, that he said: We were told by Ali bin Hasan bin Ali bin Faddal, from his father, from Abu’l-Hasan, Ali ibn Musa al-Rida, peace be upon him, that he said: Indeed, the first which Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, created in order to teach His servants writing, were the letters of the alphabet. If a man was hit on his head with a stick and he was to claim that he is not fluent of some speech, the ruling with his regard is that he is presented with the letters of the alphabet and then given indemnity by the degree of what he is not fluent with. Furthermore, I was told by my father, of his father, of his grandfather, of the Commander of the Believers, peace be upon him, with regards to «Alif Baa’ Taa Thaa’» that he said: The «Alif» is the Bounties [1] of Allah, the «Baa’» is the Delight [2] of Allah, the «Taa’» is the completion [3] of the matter with the Qa’im of the Family of Muhammed, Allah’s blessings be upon and his Family, and the «Thaa’» is the reward [4] of the believers for their righteous deeds. «Jeem Hhaa’ Khaa’» the «Jeem» is the Beauty [5] of Allah and the Glory [6] of Allah, the «Hhaa’» is the Forbearance [7] of Allah towards the sinners and the «Khaa’» is the dullness [8] of the people of disobedient acts to Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He. «Daal Dhaal» the «Daal» is the Religion [9] of Allah and the «Dhaal» stems from the Possessor of Glory [10]. «Raa’ Zaay» the «Raa» stems from the Compassionate, the Merciful, and «Zaay» is the earthquake [11] on the Day of Resurrection. «Seen Sheen» the «Seen» is the Sublimity [12] of Allah and the «Sheen» is that Allah wished [13] what He wished and wanted what He wanted, and you may not wish except by (permission of) the wish of Allah. «Ssaad Dhaad» the «Ssaad» stems from Truthful in promise with regards to carrying people on the Path and withholding the oppressors at the Observation Point and the «Dhaad» is: astray [14] is he who opposes Muhammed and the Family of Muhammed, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family. «Ttaa’ Dhaa’» the «Ttaa’» is: Tuba for the believers, and for them is a good return, and the «Dhaa’» is the assumption [15] of the believers in goodness towards Allah and the assumption of the disbelievers in evil towards Him. «’Ayn Ghayn» the «’Ayn» stems from Knowledgeable and «Ghayn» stems from Rich [16]. «Faa’ Qaaf» the «Faa’» refers to a relief [17] from the doors of relief and a crowd [18] from the crowds of the Fire, and the «Qaaf» is a Qur’an which is upon Allah to gather and recite. «Kaaf Laam» the «Kaaf» stems from Sufficient and the «Laam» refers to the nonsense [19] of the disbelievers in their fabrication of lies against Allah. «Meem Nun» the «Meem» refers to the Kingdom of Allah on the Day when there is no king but Him and He, Exalted and Glorious is He, will say: «To whom is the Kingdom today?» (40:16). Then the souls of His Prophets, Messengers and Proofs will speak and say: «To Allah, the One, the Prevailing» (40:16). Then He, Glorified be His Glory, will say: «Today, every soul shall be rewarded with what it earned. There is no injustice today. Indeed, Allah is Swift in account.» (40:17). The «Nun» refers to the favor [20] of Allah to the believers and His exemplary punishment [21] of the disbelievers. «Waw Haa’» the «Waw» refers to woe [22] to those who disobey Allah and the «Haa’» refers to that those who disobey Allah are despised. «Laa Yaa’» the «Laam Alif» refer to: there is no god but Allah [23], and that is the word of sincerity; there is no servant who says it with sincerity except that Paradise is made obligatory for him. «Yaa’» is the Hand [24] of Allah above His creation, the Extender of sustenance, Glorified and Exalted is He above what they associate. Then he, peace be upon him said: Indeed, Allah, Blessed and Exalted is He, sent down this Qur’an with these letters which are exchanged by all the Arabs. Then he said: «Say: Certainly, if the humans and the jinns were to gather to bring an equal to this Qur’an, they will not bring an equal to it, even if they were to each other, assistants.» (17:88)"

We were told of this narration by Abu Abdillah bin Abi Hamid, who said: We were informed by Abu Nasr, Ahmad bin Muhammed bin Yazid bin Abdul-Rahman al-Bukhari, in Bukhara, that he said: We were told by Ahmad bin Ahmad bin Ya’qub, son of the brother of Sahl bin Ya’qub al-Bazzaz, that he said: We were told by Ishaq bin Hamza, that he said: We were told by Abu Ahmad, Isa bin Musa al-Najjar, of Muhammed bin Ziyad al-Sukkari, of Furat in Sulayman, of Aban, of Anas, that he said: The Messenger of Allah, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, said: Learn the interpretation of Abu Jaad [1], for indeed, in it are all amazing things. And he mentioned the same narration, equivalent, letter by letter."

We were told by our teachers, may Allah be pleased with them, with attributed, connected, chains which I have mentioned in the book ‘Ilal-ush-Shara’I’ wal-Ahkam wal-Asbab in diffused chapters and which I have put in order, and it includes that the meaning of Adam is that he was created from the tanned soil, and the tanned is the Fourth Earth. The meaning of Hawwa’ is that she was created from a living, that is Adam. The meaning of a human being is that he forgets , and the meaning of women is that they are a company to men, and the meaning of a woman is that she was created from an individual .

The meaning of Nuh is that he used to lament over himself, and he wept for five hundred years, and he lamented to himself due to what was in his people of aberration. The meaning of the flood in his days is that the water flooded above everything. The meaning of Hud is that he was a guide towards what his people aberrated from, and he was sent to them that he might guide them from their aberration. The meaning of the barren wind by which Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, annihilated ‘Ad is that it was fertilized with torment and barrened from wind, like how a man is barrened if he is sterile and it is not begotten to him, and so, those castles, fortresses, cities and facilities were pulverized until all of that returned to being particled sand that is hit by the wind. The meaning of the City of Pillars [1] is that ‘Ad used to engrave pillars from mountains and make the length of the pillar like the length of the mountain which they were peeling from its bottom to its top, and then they would move those pillars and erect them, and then they would build castles above them, and so it was named the City of Pillars due to that. The meaning of Ibrahim is that he set his purpose and regained strength . The meaning of the Two-Horned is that he called his people to Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, and they hit him on his right horn [2], and so he was absent from them for a while, and then he returned to them and they hit him on his other horn. The meaning of the people of the Well is that they were ascribed to a river called the Rass of the Land of the East. It was also said that Rass is a well, and that its people buried their Prophet after Sulayman bin Dawud, peace be upon them both. They were a people worshipping a pine tree called Shah Darakht, which was sown by Yafith bin Nuh [3], and it sprouted for Nuh after the flood. Their women occupied themselves with women instead of men, and so Allah punished them with a stormy wind whose redness was intense, and He made the earth beneath them into sulfur stone that is ignitable, and they were shadowed by a black, darkening, cloud, and it encompassed them like a dome, becoming a blazing ember, and their bodies melted like how graphite is melted in fire.

And so is Jibra’eel, for the meaning of Isra’eel is the Strength of Allah, and so is every name whose ending is «Eel» that is preceded by a servant or a minor servant , and «Eel» is Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He. In this manner, Jibra’eel means the Servant of Allah, and Mika’eel means the Minor Servant of Allah, and similarly, the meaning of Israfeel is the Minor Servant of Allah. The meaning of Yusuf is taken from He caused distress , he is causing distress , meaning: He angered, he is causing anger to, his brothers. Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, said: «And when they grieved Us , We took retribution from them» (43:55). The purpose of the name of Yusuf is it was to anger his brothers due to what was to appear from his virtue over them. The meaning of Musa is that he was picked up by the family of Pharaoh from the sea in the midst of the water and trees whilst he was in the coffin. In the language of the Coptic, the one taken from the water and trees is called Musa, because water is «Mu» and trees are «Sa» and so they named him Musa due to that. The meaning of Khidr is that he did not sit on a dry try nor a white ground except that it shaked into green, and his name was Taliya bin Malkan ‘Aber [13] bin Arfakhshadh ibn Sam bin Nuh, peace be upon him. The meaning of Tur Sina’ [16] is that on it was an olive tree, and every mountain on which there is what to benefit from of plants and trees is called Tur Sina’ and Tur Sinin, and that from the mountains on which there is not what to benefit from of plants and trees is called a mountain or «Tur», and it is not called «Tur Sina’» nor «Tur Sinin». The meaning of His saying, Exalted and Glorious is He, to Musa: «So, take off your sandals» means: Put an end to your two fears, referring to his fear for the loss of his family when he had left her to give birth, and his fear from Pharao. It has been narrated that his sandals were of the leather of a donkey who had died (of natural causes), whereas the sacred valley was the purified. As for Tuwa, it was the name of the valley. The meaning of His saying, Exalted and Glorious is He: «And speak to him a lenient speech» (20:44) is: Address him by his nickname aand say to him: O Abu Mus’ab – Pharao’s name was Waleed bin Mus’ab and his nickname was Abu Mus’ab [5]. The meaning of «Pharao, the man of pickets» (89:10) is that when he would torture a man, he would extend him on the ground or on an extended plank, and he would fasten his hands and legs with four pickets, and then he would leave him in his condition until he dies, and so Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, named him the man of pickets for that. The meaning of Dawud is that he healed his wound and then loved. It was also said: He healed his affection through obedience until it was said: He has served. The meaning of Ayoub is that it stems from: He returned, he returns, which is that he was to return to comfort, grace, family, money and children after the affliction. The meaning of Yunus is that he went sociably to his Lord, angry at his people, and became sociable with his people after his return to them.

Nuh, Ibrahim, Musa, Isa and Muhammed, peace be upon them, were named Those of Obligations because they were the ones with obligations and legislations. It has also been narrated another meaning, which is that the meaning of Those of Obligations is that were determined to adjudicate what was solemnly pledged to them with regards to Muhammed and the Imams, Allah’s blessings be upon them."

He made me the Messenger of Mercy, the Messenger of Returning [4], the Messenger of Epics, and the Traced, as I made the Prophets trace me in congregation [5], and I am the Precious, the Complete, the Collector. My Lord bestowed upon me a favor and said to me: O Muhammed, may Allah’s blessings be upon you, verily, I have sent every Messenger to his nation (to address them) by their tongue, and I sent you to every red and black of my creation, and I assisted you with the horror which I have not assisted anyone with, and I allowed for you the booty, and it was not allowed for anyone before you, and I gave to you and to your nation a treasure from the Treasures of My Throne, the Opening of the Book and the Seal of Surat al-Baqarah, and I made for you and your nation all the earth a spot of prostration and a purified soil, and I gave to you and to your nation the Takbeer [6], and I made your remembrance equivalent to My remembrance, so none of your nation will remember Me except that he remembers you along with My remembrance.

Then he said: Because he had a son called Qasim, and so he was nicknamed due to him. He said: Then I said to him: O son of Allah’s Messenger, do you see me deserving for more? He said: Yes.

He said: Have you not known that Allah’s Messenger, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, is a father to all his nation, and that Ali, peace be upon him, is in his position among them? I said: Sure. He said: Have you not known that Ali is the divider between Paradise and the Fire? I said: Sure. He said: Hence, he was called Abu’l-Qasim because he is the father of the divider of Paradise and the Fire. Then I said to him: And what is the meaning of that? Then he said: Indeed, the compassion of the Prophet, Allah’s blessings be upon him and hi Family, upon his nation is as the compassion of fathers upon children, and the best among his nation is Ali bin Abi Talib, peace be upon him. After him, the compassion of Ali, peace be upon him, upon them is like the compassion of him, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, because he is his Bequeathed, Successor and Imam after therein. Then he said: Hence, for that he, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, said: I and Ali are the fathers of this nation. The Prophet, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, climbed the pulpit and said: He who leaves behind a debt or a wastage, it is upon me, and to me (shall one come), and he who leaves behind property, it is for his inheritors. By that, he became of more priority to them than their fathers and mothers, and he became of more priority to them than their own selves, and so was the Commander of the Believers, peace be upon him, after him, it applied to him the same as what applied to Allah’s Messenger, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family."

He said: You are, O Musa, from his nation if you know him, know his rank and the rank of his Household. Indeed, the example of him and the example of his Household and that which I have created, is like the example of Firdaus in the Gardens, whose trees never dry, nor does its taste change.

When Allah created Adam, He made that Light into his backbone, and he resided in the Garden whilst we were in his backbone, and he intended to perform the intentional mistake whilst we were in his backbone, and Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, did not cease moving us from pure backbones into pure wombs until He ended us up at Abdul-Muttalib, and so He divided us into two halfs, and He made into the backbone of Abdullah and made Ali into the backbone of Abu Talib, and He made in me the Prophethood and Blessing, and in Ali the Fluentness and Knighthood.

We were told by Abu’l-Abbas, Muhammed bin Ibrahim bin Ishaq al-Talaqani, may Allah grant him mercy, that he said: We were told by Abdul-Aziz bin Yahya al-Jaloudi in Basra, that he said, I was told by Mughaira bin Muhammed, that he said: We were told by Rajaa’ bin Salama, from Amru bin Shimr, from Jabir al-Ju’fi, from Abu Ja’far, Muhammed bin Ali, peace be upon them both, that he said: The Commander of the Believers, Ali bin Abi Talib, Allah’s blessings be upon him, gave a speech in Kufa after his return from Nahrawan, and it had reached him that Mu’awiya is verbally insulting him, cursing him and killing his companions, and so he stood up to give a speech. Then he praised Allah and commended Him, and he sent blessings upon the Messenger of Allah, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, and he mentioned what Allah bestowed of grace upon His Prophet and upon himself, then he said: Were it not for a verse in the Book of Allah, I would not have mentioned what I am now mentioning in this position of mine. Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, says: «And as for the grace of your Lord, then speak.» (93:11) O Allah, to You belongs the praise for Your grace that cannot be counted, and Your favor that cannot be forgotten. O people, indeed, it has reached me what has reached me, and verily, I see that my time has come near. It is as if I am with you and you have forgotten my case, and I am leaving among you what the Messenger of Allah, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, left; the Book of Allah and my Family, that is the Family of the Guide to Salvation, the Seal of the Prophets, and he is the Master of Nobles and the Selected Prophet. O people, perhaps you might not hear a sayer say the like of my saying after me, except for a calumniator. I am the brother of Allah’s Messenger, the son of his paternal uncle, the sword of his wrath, the pillar of his victory, his strength and intensity, the circling mill of Hell, its pulverizing grinders. I am the orphanizer of boys and girls, I am the grabber of souls and the punishment of Allah that He will not repel from the criminal people. I am the quarrelling with heroes, the slayer of knights, the executor of those who disbelieved in the All-Merciful and the in-law of the Best of mankind. I am the Master of Sucessors and the Successor of the Best of Prophets. I am the Door to the City of Knowledge and the Keeper of the knowledge of Allah’s Messenger and his inheritor. I am the husband of the Batul [1], the Mistress of the Lady of all the worlds, Fatima, the godfearing, the clean, the pure, the good-doer, the guided, the beloved of Allah’s Beloved, the best of his daughters and progeny and the sweet smelling plant of Allah’s Messenger. His two grandsons are the best of grandsons, and my two sons are the best of sons. Does anyone deny what I say? Where are the Muslims from the People of the Book? My name is, in the Injeel, Elia, and in the Tawrat, Bara’, and in the Zabur, Ara, and among the Indians, Kabkar, and among the Romans, Batrisa, and among the Persians, Jabtar, and among the Turks, Batheer, and among the blacks, Haitar, and among the shamans, Boyi’, and among the Abyssinians, Bathrik, and for my mother, Haidara, and for my wet nurse, Maimoun, and among the Arabs, Ali, and among the Armenians, Fareeq, and for my father, Dhaheer. Alas, I am, verily, specified in the Qur’an with names. Beware from overlooking them, lest you aberrate in your religion. Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, says: «Indeed, Allah is with the truthful.» [2] I am that Truthful, and I am the Announcer in this world and the Hereafter. Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, said: «Then an announcer will announce among them: May the curse of Allah be upon the wrong-doers.» (7:44) I am that announcer. And He said: «And an announcement from Allah and His Messenger» (9:3). I am that Announcement. And I am the Good-Doer, about whom Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, says: «Indeed, Allah is with the good-doers.» (29:69) And I am the One with the heart, about whom Allah says: «Indeed, in that is, verily, a reminder for he who has a heart» (50:37). And I am the Rememberer, about whom Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, says: «Who remember Allah whilst standing and sitting and lying on their sides» (3:191). And we are the people of the Elevations, I, my paternal uncle, my brother and the son of my paternal uncle. By Allah, the Divider of the seeds and kernels, the Fire will not enter into a lover of us, and no hater of us will enter Paradise. Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, said: «And on the elevations are men who recognize all by their marks.» (7:46) And I am the in-law, about whom Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, says: «And it is He who created from water, a human being and made him (a relative by) lineage and marriage.» (25:54) And I am the Conscious Ear, about whom Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, says: «And (that) it is perceived by a conscious ear.» (69:12) And I am the Peace to His Messenger, about which Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, said: «And a man belonging entirely to one man» (39:29). And from my sons is the Mahdi of this nation. Alas, your misfortune has, verily, been made that with hatred to me, the hypocrites are recognized, and with love to me, Allah tests the believers. This is the covenant of the Ummi Prophet to me: None will love you, except for a believer, and none will hate you, except for a hater. And I am the carrier of the banner of Allah’s Messenger, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, in this world and the Hereafter. The Messenger of Allah is my precedent, and I am the precedent of my Shia’. By Allah, my lover will not become thirsty, nor will my ally fear, whilst I am the Ally of the Believers and Allah is my Ally. It is sufficient for my lovers to love what Allah loves, and it is sufficient for my haters to hate what Allah loves. Alas, it has, indeed, reached me that Mu’awiya has verbally insulted me and cursed me. O Allah, intensify Your hit upon him, and send down the curse upon the deserving, Ameen, O Lord of all the worlds, the Lord of Isma’eel and the Sender of Ibrahim. Indeed, You are Praised, Commendable. Then he, peace be upon him, stepped down from his old camels, and he did not return to it until he was killed by Ibn Muljim, may Allah curse him. Jabir said: We will come to interpret what we mentioned of his names. As for the saying of him, peace be upon him: My name is, in the Injeel, Elia, it is Ali in the tongue of the Arabs. And in the Tawrat, Bara’. He said: He was free from polytheism. And among the shamans, Boyi’, it is he who takes a place and frees another from a place, and he is the one who returns the truth to its places and invalidates falsehood and impairs it. And in the Zabur, Ari, and he is the lion who beats the bones and devours the flesh. And among the Indians, Kabkar, He said: They read in books which include the mentioning of Allah’s Messenger, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, and it was mentioned in them that his supporter is Kabkar, and he is the one who if he wants something, he persists on it and does not depart from it until he reaches it. And among the Romans, Batrisa. He said: He is the seizer of souls. And among the Persians, Habtar, and he is the falcon that hunts. And among the Turks Batheer. He said: He is the tiger who if he puts his claw into something, he penetrates it. And among the blacks, Haitar. He said: He is the one that cuts joints. And among the Abyssinians, Bathrik. He said: He is the destroyer of everything he comes across. And for my mother, Haidara. He said: He is the one with the firm opinion, the acquainted, the digger, the observer into the details of things. And for my wet nurse, Maimoun. Jabir said: I was informed by Muhammed bin Ali, peace be upon him, that he said: The wet nurse of Ali, peace be upon him, who nursed him was a woman from the sons of Hilal. She had left him in her tent, and with him was a milk brother who was older than him in age with one year except for a few days. Near the tent, there was a well, and so the boy went to the well and put his head into it. Then Ali, peace be upon him, crawled behind him and the foot of Ali, peace be upon him, tangled to the tent’s rope, and so he pulled the rope until it came on his brother and tangled itself to one of his feet and one of his arms. As for hand, it was in his mouth, and as for the foot, it was in his hand. Then his mother came and managed to save him, and she yelled: O my jawbone, O my jawbone, O my jawbone for a fortunate boy who saved for me my son! Then they took the two boys from the top of the well while they were amazed of his strength, due to his childhood, the tangling of his foot to the tent and his pulling of the child until they managed to save him. Then his mother named him Maimoun, meaning blessed, and the boy among the sons of Hilal was known as the one tangled to Maimoun, and so were his sons till today. And among the Armenians, Fareeq. He said: The Fareeq is the bold who is feared by people. And for my father, Dhaheer. He said: His father used to gather his sons and the sons of his brothers and then order them to wrestle, and that was a tradition among the Arabs. Ali, peace be upon him, used to expose his two solid, short, forearms when he was a child, and he would wrestle his big and small brothers, and the big and small ones of the sons of his paternal uncle, and he would defeat them. Then his father would say: Ali has gained victory . Hence, he named him Dhaheer. And among the Arabs, Ali. Jabir said: The people of knowledge differed with regards to why Ali was named Ali. A group said: None from the sons of Adam have been named with this name among the Arabs nor among the non-Arabs, except if a man of the Arabs would say: This son of mine is high , intending to refer to highness , not to name him, and that people were only named with it after him and during his time. Another group said: Ali was named Ali due to his sublimity over everyone who sword-fought him. Another group said: Ali was named Ali because his house in the Gardens is elevated to the extent it aligns with the homes of the Prophets, and there is no Prophet whose rank elevates the rank of Ali. Another group said: Ali was named Ali because he mounted the back of Allah’s Messenger, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, with his feet, out of obedience to Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, and none has mounted the back of a Prophet other than him, during the bringing down of idols from the top of the Kaaba. Another group said: Ali was only named Ali because he was married in the Highest of Heavens, and none from the creations of Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, was married in that place other than thim. Another group said: Ali was only named Ali because he was the one of the people with the highest knowledge after Allah’s Messenger, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family."

We were told by Ali bin Ahmad bin Muhammed bin Imran al-Daqqaq, may Allah grant him mercy, that he said: We were told by Muhammed bin Ja’far al-Asadi, that he said: We were told by Musa bin Imran, from Hussain bin Yazid, from Muhammed bin Sinan, from Mufaddal bin Umar, from Thabit bin Dinar, from Sa’eed bin Jubayr, that he said: Yazid bin Qa’nab said: I was sitting with Abbas bin Abdul-Muttalib and a group from the sons of Abdul-‘Uzza opposite to the Sacred House of Allah as Fatima bin Asad, the mother of the Commander of the Believers, peace be upon him, and she was pregnant with him for nine months and was taken by labor pain, so she said: My Lord, I am a believer in You and in what has come from You of Messengers and Books, and indeed, I declare belief in the words of my grandfather, Ibrahim the Good Friend, and he, indeed, built the Old House. Hence, by the Prophet who built this House, and by the infant that is in my belly, please, ease for me my labor. Yazid bin Qa’nab said: Then we saw the House as it opened from behind, Fatima entered into it, she became absent from our eyes and the wall merged. Then we hoped for the door’s lock to open to us, and it did not open, and so we knew that this was by the commandment of Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He. Then she went out after the fourth and in her hand was the Commander of the Believers, peace be upon him. Then she said: Indeed, I have been preferred over the women who have preceded me, because Asiya bint Muzahim worshipped Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, secretly in a place in which Allah does not like to be worshipped except in urgency, and Mariam bint Imran shook the dry palm tree with her hand until she ate harvested dates from it. I, though, entered into the Sacred House of Allah and ate from the fruits and leaves of Paradise, and when I wanted to exit, a caller called to me: O Fatima, name him Ali, for he is Ali , and Allah, the All-High, the Most Subleme, says: His name is from My Name, disciplined him with My Discipline and gave him success to (comprehend) My Occult Knowledge, and he is the one to break the idols in My House, and he is the one to recite the Adhan above the roof of My House and sanctify Me and glorify Me. Hence, Tuba is for those who love him and obey him, and woe to those who hate him and disobey him."

For indeed, we have heard you, O Allah’s Messenge,r say that Maryam was a Batul and that Fatima is a Batul?

The Imam was named an Imam because he is a role-model for the people, assigned by Allah, Exalted is His Remembrance, whose obedience is obligatory upon the servants. Ali bin Hussain, peace be upon them both, was named the Sajjad due to what was on his prostrating parts of effects of prostration , and he used to pray in one day and night, a thousand rak’a [1]. He was named the One with Calluses because on the spot of his prostration, he had swollen effects, and he used to cut them twice a year, each time five calluses, and so he was named the One with Calluses for that. Al-Baqir, peace be upon him, was named a Baqir because he slit knowledge open, a true splitting, meaning that he cut it a true cutting and demonstrated it, a true demonstration. Al-Sadiq was named a Sadiq in order it to be recognized who the claimer of Imamate without right is, and that is Ja’far bin Ali, the leader of the Second Fathis. Musa bin Ja’far, peace be upon them both, was named the Kadhim because he used to repress his rage towards those whom he knew would stand on his truth and knowingly reject the Imam after him out of greed for his property. Ali bin Musa, peace be upon them both, was named the Rida because he was pleased with Allah, Exalted is His Remembrance, in His Heaven, pleased with the Messenger and the Imams after him, peace be upon them, in His earth, and the opponents from his enemies were pleased with him like how the congruent from his allies were pleased with him. Muhammed bin Ali, the Second, peace be upon them both, was named the Taqi because he feared Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, and so Allah shielded from him the evil of Ma’mun when he entered into him at night, drunk, and hit him by his sword to the extent he assumed that he had killed him, and so Allah shielded him from his evil. The two Imams, Ali bin Muhammed and Hasan bin Ali, peace be upon them both, were named the Askariyyain [2] because they were ascribed to the place in which they resided in Surr Man Ra’a [3], and it used to be called a military camp. The Qa’im was named a Qa’im because he will arise after the death of his remembrance. It has been reported other than that with regards to this meaning.

صلوات الله عليه - وكتمتها الحسين عليه السلام زمانا ثم حدثته به فوجدته قد سبقني إليه فسألته عما سأله عنه فوجدته قد سأل أباه عن مدخل النبي صلى الله عليه وآله ومخرجه ومجلسه وشكله، فلم يدع منه شيئا. قال الحسين عليه السلام: سألت أبي عليه السلام عن مدخل رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله، فقال: كان دخوله لنفسه مأذونا له في ذلك فإذا أوى إلى منزله جزء دخوله ثلاثة أجزاء: جزء لله، وجزء لأهله، وجزء لنفسه، ثم جزء جزءه بينه وبين الناس فيرد ذلك بالخاصة على العامة ولا يدخر عنهم منه شيئا وكان من سيرته في جزء الأمة إيثار أهل الفضل بإذنه وقسمه على قدر فضلهم في الدين، فمنهم ذو الحاجة، ومنهم ذو الحاجتين، ومنهم ذو الحوائج، فيتشاغل بهم ويشغلهم في ما أصلحهم والأمة من مسألته عنهم وبإخبارهم بالذي ينبغي، ويقول: ليبلغ الشاهد منكم الغائب، وأبلغوني حاجة من لا يقدر على إبلاغ حاجته فإنه من أبلغ سلطانا حاجة من لا يقدر على إبلاغها ثبت الله قدميه يوم القيامة لا يذكر عنده إلا ذلك ولا يقيد من أحد عثرة، يدخلون روادا ، ولا يفترقون إلا عن ذواق، ويخرجون أدلة . قال: فسألته عن مخرج رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله كيف كان يصنع فيه؟ فقال: كان رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله يخزن لسانه إلا عما يعنيه ، ويؤلفهم ولا ينفرهم، ويكرم كريم كل قوم و يوليه عليهم، ويحذر الناس ويحترس منهم من غير أن يطوي عن أحد بشره ولا خلقه، ويتفقد أصحابه، ويسأل الناس عما في الناس، ويحسن الحسن ويقويه، ويقبح القبيح ويهونه، معتدل الامر، غير مختلف، لا يغفل مخافة أن يغفلوا أو يملوا ، ولا يقصر عن الحق ولا يجوزه، الذين يلونه من الناس خيارهم، أفضلهم عنده أعمهم نصيحة للمسلمين وأعظمهم عنده منزلة أحسنهم مؤاساة ومؤازرة. فسألته عن مجلسه فقال: كان صلى الله عليه وآله لا يجلس ولا يقوم إلا على ذكر، ولا يوطن الأماكن وينهى عن إيطانها، وإذا انتهى إلى قوم جلس حيث ينتهي به المجلس ويأمر بذلك، ويعطى كل جلسائه نصيبه، ولا يحسب من جلسائه أن أحدا أكرم عليه منه، من جالسه صابره حتى يكون هو المنصرف عنه، من سأله حاجة لم يرجع إلا بها أو بميسور من القول، قد وسع الناس منه خلقه وصار لهم أبا وصاروا عنده في الخلق سواء، مجلسه مجلس حلم وحياء وصدق وأمانة ولا ترتفع فيه الأصوات، ولا تؤبن فيه الحرم ، ولا تنثى فلتأته، متعادلين، متواصلين فيه بالتقوى، متواضعين، يوقرون الكبير، ويرحمون الصغير، ويؤثرون ذا الحاجة، و يحفظون الغريب. فقلت: فكيف كان سيرته في جلسائه؟ فقال: كان دائم البشر ، سهل الخلق، لين الجانب، ليس بفظ، ولا غليظ، ولا صخاب ، ولا فحاش، ولا عياب ولا مداح، يتغافل عما لا يشتهي، فلا يؤيس منه، ولا يخيب فيه مؤمليه، قد ترك نفسه من ثلاث: المراء، والاكثار، وما لا يعنيه، وترك الناس من ثلاث: كان لا يذم أحدا، ولا يعيره ، ولا يطلب عثراته ولا عورته. ولا يتكلم إلا في ما رجا ثوابه إذا تكلم أطرق جلساؤه كأنما على رؤوسهم الطير، فإذا سكتتكلموا، ولا يتنازعون عنده الحديث، من تكلم أنصتوا له حتى يفرغ، حديثهم عنده حديث أولهم، يضحك مما يضحكون منه، ويتعجب مما يتعجبون منه، ويصبر للغريب على الجفوة في مسألته ومنطقه حتى أن كان أصحابه ليستجلبونهم، ويقول: إذا رأيتم طالب الحاجة يطلبها فارفدوه ، ولا يقبل الثناء إلا من مكافئ، ولا يقطع على أحد كلامه حتى يجوز فيقطعه بنهي أو قيام. قال: فسألته عن سكوت رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله. قال: كان سكوته على أربع: على الحلم والحذر، والتقدير، والتفكر . فأما التقدير ففي تسوية النظر والاستماع بين الناس وأما تفكره ففيما يبقى أو يفنى، وجمع له الحلم في الصبر، فكان لا يغضبه شئ ولا يستفزه وجمع له الحذر في أربع، أخذه بالحسن ليقتدى به، وتركه القبيح لينتهى عنه، واجتهاده الرأي في صلاح أمته، والقيام فيما جمع لهم من خير الدنيا والآخرة. هذا آخر ما رواه عبدان. وحدثنا أبو علي أحمد بن يحيى المؤدب، قال: حدثنا محمد بن الهيثم الأنباري قال: حدثنا عبد الله بن الصقر السكري أبو العباس، قال: حدثنا سفيان بن وكيع بن الجراح، قال: حدثني جميع بن عمير العجلي إملاء من كتابه، قال: حدثني رجل من بني تميم من ولد أبي هالة التميمي، عن أبيه، عن الحسن بن علي بن أبي طالب عليهما السلام قال: سألت خالي هند بن أبي هالة التميمي قال: وكان وصافا للنبي صلى الله عليه وآلهوأنا أشتهي أن يضف لي منه شيئا لعلي أتعلق به، فقال: كان رسول الله صلى الله عليه فخما مفخما وذكر الحديث بطوله.","1. We were told by Muhammed bin Ibrahim bin Ishaq al-Talaqani, may Allah grant him mercy, that he said: We were told by Abu Ahmad, Qasim bin Bandar, known as Abu Saleh al-Hadhha’, that he said: We were told by Ibrahim bin Nasr bin Abdul-Aziz al-Razi, the visitor of Nahavand, that he said: We were told by Abu Ghassan, Malik Isma’il al-Nahdi, that he said: We were told by Jumay’ ibn Umair bin Abdul-Rahman al-‘Ajali, that he said: I was told by a man in Mecca, from Ibn Abi Halah al-Tamimi, from Hasan bin Ali, peace be upon them both, that he said: I asked my maternal uncle, Hind, Abu Halah, and he was a describer [1], about the ornaments of Allah’s Messenger, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family. And I was told by Hasan bin Abdullah bin Sa’eed al-Askari, that he said: We were informed by Abu’l-Qasim, Abdullah bin Muhammed bin Abdul-Aziz bin Manee’, that he said: I was told by Isma’il bin Muhammed bin Ishaq bin Ja’far ibn Muhammed bin Ali bin Hussain, peace be upon them, in the city of Allah’s Messenger, that he said: I was told by Ali bin Musa bin Ja’far ibn Muhammed bin Ali, from Musa bin Ja’far, from Ja’far bin Muhammed, from his father, from Ali bin Hussain, peace be upon them, that he said: Hasan bin Ali, peace be upon them both, said: I asked my maternal uncle, Hind bin Abi Halah, from the ornament of Allah’s Messenger, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family. And I was told by Hasan bin Abdullah bin Sa’eed, that he said: We were told by Abdullah bin Ahmad ‘Abdan and Ja’far bin Muhammed al-Bazzaz al-Baghdadi, that they both said: We were told by Sufyan bin Wakee’, that he said: I was told by Jumay’ bin Umair al-‘Ajali, that he said: I was told by a man from the sons of Tamim, from the sons of Abu Halah, from his father, from Hasan bin Ali, peace be upon them both, that he said: I asked my maternal uncle, Hind bin Abi Halah al-Tamimi, and he was a describer of the Prophet, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family: I seek that you describe to me from him something, that I might be connected to him. So he said: The Messenger of Allah, Allah’s blessings be upon him was magnificent, dignified; his face pearling like the pearling of the moon at a night of a full moon; longer than one of mid-height; shorter than one of thinness and long-height; having a great head; crook-haired; if his gathered hair is separated, it separates, otherwise, his hair would not cross the meat of his ear if grew it; his color was lightening [2], wide-foreheaded, having long brows, perfect, not being joined; between them is moisture, poured by anger; having a hooked nose; having a light above him; he who does not contemplate on him considers him highborn; thick-bearded; flat-cheecked; big-mouthed; ashnab [3]; gap-toothed; having a sound torso hair; his neck was in good image of clear silver; he was of moderate build; having a solid body; having even belly and chest; distanced between the shoulder flanks; having large metaphysis; wide-chested; having brightening bare skin; connected between the upper chest and the navel with hair flowing like a line, bare-breasted and bare-bellied from other than that; hairy on the upper arms, shoulder flanks and upper chest; having long forearms; having a spacious palm; coarse in the palms and feet; having fluent sides; having extended bones; having a raised sole; having even feet, from which water flows away; if he is to go, he goes firmly; stepping in harmony and walking calmly; walking with big steps, as if he steps into deep spots; if he turns to look, he turns wholly; having a lowered side; his look was towards the ground, longer than his look towards the sky; most of his looking was observation; he takes initiative to send peace to whom he meets. He said: Then I said: Then describe to me his speech. So he said: He, peace be upon him, was continuously sad; always thinking; having no rest; long-lastingly silent; not speaking while there is no need; opening and sealing the speech with the mouth corners; speaking with inclusive terms, separating, having no overage nor short-doing; kind, mild, not being gross nor humiliating; the grace is magnified for him, even if it is tiny; he would not hide from it anything, except that he used to not condemn a taster nor praise him, nor is he angered by the world and what is for it; if a right was involved into, none would recognize him; nothing arose due to his anger except that he would gain victory for it; if he was to point, he would point with his whole palm; if he is amazed, he would turn it; if he speaks, he would connect to it, and he would hit with his right the inward of his left thumb; if he was angered, he would ignore and turn away; if he became joyful, he looked aside; most of his laughing was smiling; his laugh would be like the uncovering of clouds. Until here is what Abu’l-Qasem bin Manee’ narrated from Isma’il bin Muhammed bin Ishaq bin Ja’far bin Muhammed, and the the rest is the narration of Abdul-Rahman until its end. Hasan, Allah’s blessings be upon him: I concealed it from Hussain, peace be upon him, for a while and then I told him of it, and I found that he had preceded me to it, so I asked him of what he had asked him of, and I found that he had asked his father about the entrance of the Prophet, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, and his exiting, sitting and shape, and he did not leave anything from him. Hussain, peace be upon him, said: I asked my father, peace be upon him, about the entrance of Allah’s Messenger, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, so he said: His entrance for himself was that he was given permission for that. When he would go to his home, he divided his entrance into three parts: I part for Allah, a part for his family and part for himself, and then he divided the part between himself and between the people, and he would then teach this to the specific (people) for the general (people to be taught), and he would not keep from them anything. It was from his tradition with the part of the nation to be benevolent towards the people of virtue by his permission and division on the basis their virtue in religion. Among them were those of one requirement, and among them were those of two requirements, and among them were those of (several) requirements, and so he would be kept busy with them and keep them busy with what is best to them, and so with the nation with regards to his questioning about them and informing of them with what should be, and he would say: Let the witnessing among you inform the absent, and inform me of the requirement of the one who is not able to inform of his requirement, for indeed, the one who informs a ruler of the requirement of the one who is not able to inform of it, Allah will fasten his feet on the Day of Resurrection. Nothing other than that would be mentioned at his presence. He would not restrict from anyone accidentally. They would enter by seeking, not disperse except after tasting and they would leave having been guided. He said: Then I asked him about the exiting of Allah’s Messenger, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family: How did he do it? So he said: The Messenger of Allah, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, used to keep his tongue except from that which concerns him; concord with them and not shun them away; be generous with the generous one from every people and appoint him over them; be warned of people and guarded from them without concealing for anyone his extroversion nor manners; check on his companions; ask the people about what goes on among people; declare the good as good and strengthen it; declare the horrid as horrid and degrade it; be moderate in his matter; not be contrasting; not be heedless out of fear that they become heedless or bored; not make short towards the truth, nor exceed it. Those who followed him among the people were the best of them, the best of them to him being the most inclusive in assistance to the Muslims, and those with the greatest position among them to him being the best of them in consolation and aid. Then I asked him about his sitting, so he said: He, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, did not sit nor stand except by performing a remembrance (of Allah); he would not settle in places and prohibit settling in them; if he ends up at a people, he would sit where the gathering ends at, and he would instruct that; he would give all who sit with him his portion; he would not assume from those who sit with them that anyone of them is more generous to him than he is over them. The one who would sit with him, he would remain patient with him until he is the one to leave him. The one who asks him for a need did not return except that he had it or with simple speech. The people were enriched from him due to his manners; he became to them a father; they became to him in creation, equal. His gathering was a gathering of forbearance, modesty, truthfulness and trust; voices were not raised in it, nor were sanctities disgraced, nor were its slight faults spoken of; they were equivalent; being continuously in godfearness during it; humble; they would revere the old and be merciful to the small; they would be benevolent to the one with a requirement; and they would protect the stranger. Then I said: Then how was his tradition with regards to those who sit with him? So he said: He was always extrovert, easy-mannered, mild-sided, not gross, nor harsh, nor screaming, nor obscene, nor excessively disgracing nor praising, ignoring what he does not desire, by which it is not despaired of him, nor disappointing to those who are hopeful in him. He made himself abandon three: quarreling, overage and that which does not concern him, and he abandon three to perform in people: he used to not condemn anyone, nor disgrace him nor seek (to know) his slight faults nor his blemishes. He did not speak except in what he sought its reward; when he would speak, those who sit with him were held themselves as if birds are on their heads; and when he would become silent, they spoke, and they would not quarrel in conversation at his presence; the one who would speak, they listened to him until he is finished; their conversation in his presence would be the conversation of the first of them; he would smile to what they smile to, and be amazed at what they are amazed at; he would be patient to the stranger for his lack of interest in asking him and in his speech, until his companions would draw them; and he would say: If you see a seeker of a need seeking it, then give him. He did not accept commendation, except from one who remunerates, and he would not cut anyone from his speech until it would be permissible, and so he would cut him by prohibition or rising up. He said: Then I asked him about the silence of Allah’s Messenger, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family. He said: His silence was due to four: for forbearance, caution, estimation and reflection. As for estimation, it was with regards to having equal look and listening between people, and as for his reflection, it was about what is to remain and what is to terminate. Forbearance was joined for him along with patience, and so nothing would anger him nor provoke him. Caution was joined for him in four: his taking of goodness that he might be followed in it; his abandoning of the horrid that it might be stopped; his diligence in deducing (sound) opinion for the good of his nation; and to perform what was gathered for them from the best of this world and the Hereafter. This is the last of what ‘Abdan narrated. We were also told by Abu Ali, Ahmad bin Yahya, the Teacher, that he said: We were told by Muhammed bin Haitham al-Anbari, that he said: We were told by Abdullah bin Saqr al-Sukkari, Abu’l-Abbas, that he said: We were told by Sufyan bin Wakee’ bin Jarrah, that he said: I was told by Jumay’ bin ‘Umayr al-‘Ajali, dictating from his book, that he said: I was told by a man from the sons of Tamim, from the sons of Abu Halah al-Tamimi, from his father, from Hasan bin Ali bin Abi Talib, peace be upon them both, that he said: I asked my uncle, Hind bin Abi Halah al-Tamimi, that he said – and he was a describer of the Prophet, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family – while I had desired that he describes to me something of him that I might be connected to him, and so he said: The Messenger of Allah, Allah’s blessings be upon him, was magnificent, dignified. And he mention the same narration with its length."

We were told by Abu’l-Abbas, Muhammed bin Ibrahim bin Ishaq al-Talaqani, may Allah be pleased with him, that he said: We were told by Abu Ahmad, Qasim bin Muhammed bin Ali al-Haruni, that he said: We were told by Abu Hamid, Imran bin Musa bin Ibrahim, from Hasan bin Qasim al-Raqqam, that he said: I was told by Qasim bin Muslim, from his brother, Abdul-Aziz bin Muslim, that he said: We were with al-Rida, peace be upon him, in Merv, so we gathered in the mosque on Friday at the beginning of our arrival. Then they passed around the matter of Imamate and they mentioned the amount of dispute among the people about it. Then I entered into the place of my Master, peace be upon him, and I informed him of the people’s discourse in that, so he, peace be upon him, smiled, then he said: O Abdul-Aziz, the people are ignorant and have been deceived about their religious beliefs. Indeed, Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, did not take His Prophet, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, until He completed for them the Religion, and He sent down unto him the Qur’an, in which is the detailing of everything and in which is the clarification of the permissible, the forbidden, the fixated punishments, the rulings and all which the people are in need of, completely, and He, Exalted and glorious is He, said: «We have not neglected in the Book anything» (6:38) and so He revealed during the farewell pilgrimage, which was during the last of the age of him, peace be upon him: «Today I have completed for you your Religion, fulfilled upon you My Grace and been pleased for you Islam as a Religion.» (5:3) Hence, the matter of the Imamate is among the completion of Religion, and he, peace be upon him, did not leave until he clarified to his nation the teachings of their religion and explained to them their path, and he left them after having made them aware of intending the path of truth, and he appointed for them Ali, peace be upon them, as a Banner and an Imam, and he did not leave anything which his nation is in need to, except that he clarified it. Thus, the one who claims that Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, did not complete His Religion, then he has rejected the Book of Allah, and the one who rejects the Book of Allah is a disbeliever. Do you know the value of the Imamate and its position from the nation by which it is permissible for them to make a choice? Indeed, the Imamate is more glorious rank, greater significance, higher place, more exclusive in involvement and more preventive of being hollow than for people to be able to reach it with their intellects or obtain with their opinions, or for them to assign an Imam by their choice. Indeed, the Imamate was specified by Allah for Ibrahim the Good Friend, peace be upon him, after Prophethood, and the being of a Good Friend is a third rank and position by which He had honored him and raised his remembrance, to which He, Exalted and Glorious is He, said: «Indeed, I am making you, for the people, an Imam» (2:124) to which the Good Friend, peace be upon him, said, joyfully with it: «And from my offspring?» (2:124). Allah, Blessed and Exalted is He, said: «My Covenant does not include the wrongdoers.» (2:124) Thus, this verse invalidated Imamate in every wrongdoer until the Day of Resurrection, and so, it became in the Chosen Ones. Furthermore, Allah honored him by making it in his offspring, the People of Choosing and Purity, and said: «And We granted to him Ishaq and Ya’qoub as an addition, everyone (of them) We made righteous, and We made them Imams who guide by Our commandment, and We revealed to them the doing of good deeds, the establishment of prayer and the giving of alms, and they were to Us, worsippers.» (21:72-73) It did not cease to be in his offspring, of which some inherited of others, generation by generation, until the Prophet, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, inherited it, to which He, Glorified be His Glory, said: «Indeed, the people most worthy of Ibrahim are, verily, those who followed him, and this Prophet and those who have believed. And Allah is the Ally of the believers.» (3:68) Hence, it was for him in particular, and then the Messenger of Allah, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, appointed it to Ali, peace be upon him, by the commandment of Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, in according to what Allah had obliged, and then it became in his Pure offspring whom Allah has given knowledge and faith, due to the saying of Him, Exalted and Glorious is He: «And those who were the knowledge and faith said: You have, certainly, remained in the Book of Allah until the Day of Release» (30:56). Thus, it is in the sons of Ali, peace be upon him, exclusively, until the Day of Resurrection, as there is no Prophet after Muhammed, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family. So, from where do these ignorants choose the Imam? Indeed, the Imamate is the rank of Prophets and the inheritance of Successors. Indeed, the Imamate is, verily, the Successorship of Allah, the Successorship of the Messenger, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, the position of the Commander of the Believers and the inheritance of Hasan and Hussain, peace be upon them both, due to the saying of Him, Exalted and Glorious is He: « And those who were the knowledge and faith said» (30:56). Indeed, the Imamate is the Rope of the Religion, the System of the Muslims, the Uprightness of Material Affairs and the Honour of the Believers. Indeed, the Imamate is the growing basis of Islam and its sublime branch. With the Imam is the fulfilment of prayers, alms, fasting, pilgrimage, striving, the procurement of booty, charity, the carrying of fixated punishments, rulings and the prevention of frontiers and borders. The Imam permits that which Allah makes permissible, forbids what Allah makes forbidden, carries out the fixated punishments of Allah, defends the Religion of Allah and calls to the Path of his Lord with wisdom and good advice with the ultimate argument. The Imam is like the visible sun that shines with its light to the world while it is in the horizon in a manner it is not obtained by hands and vision. The Imam is the brightening full moon, the visible lamp, the plain light and the guiding star in the unseen dark, the plain land the and the deep of oceans. The Imam is the fresh water for the thirsty, the guide towards guidance, the driver away from destruction. The Imam is the fire above the hill that warms the one who warms himself, the guide in what makes one perish, he who separates from him, he is perished. The Imam is the raining cloud, the large-dropped rain, the brightening sun, the covering sky, the flattened earth, the abundant source, the stream and the garden. The Imam is the mild trustee, the compassionate father, the equivalent brother, the refuge of the servants during the calamity. The Imam is the Trustee of Allah among His creation, His Proof upon His servants, His Successor in His lands, the Caller to Allah and the Defender of the Sanctities of Allah. The Imam is the purified from sins, the innocent from blemishes, specified with knowledge, marked with forbearance, the System of Religion, the honor of the Muslims, the cause of rage to the hypocrites and the devastation of the hypocrites. The Imam is unique of his age, none is near to him, nor is a scholar even to him, nor is there to him any alternative, nor similar nor equal. He is specified with virtue, all of it, without any seek of it from him nor attempt of obtaining, but it is rather specified from One who bestows favor, a Granter. So, who is the one who reaches conscious knowledge of the Imam or who is able to choose him? May such be far! May such be far! Intellects have gone astray, dreams have gone lost, minds have become confused, eyes have longed, the great ones have become belittled, the wise have become confused, the forbearing have come short, the speakers have become tightened, the intellectuals have become dazed, the poets have become dimmed, the writers have become unable, and the eloquent have become incapable of describing one rank from his ranks or one virtue from his virtues, and so they acknowledged inability and short-doing. How can he be described, characterized by his nature, for it to be understood one thing from his matter or for anyone to stand in his place and to enrich with his richness? There is no «how» and «whereby» while he is like the star away from the hands of those who approach and the description of those who describe. So, where is choice with regards to this? And where are intellects from (ability to comprehend) this? And where is the like of this? Did they assume that this is among other then the Messenger’s Family? Their selves lied to them, by Allah, and they were made lost by falsehood, and so they elevated to a position of difficulty and slippery from which their feet slip to lowland. They sought to appoint the Imam with confused, dull and lacking intellects and aberrant opinions, and so they were not increased from him but with distance. May Allah destroy them! How are they deluded? They have, certainly, sought a difficult matter, uttered falsehood, aberred a distant aberration and fallen into confusion as they abandoned the Imam knowingly and Satan had beautified for them their acts, and so he repelled them from the path. They were conscious, having desired, other than the choice of Allah and the choice of His Messenger, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, to their choice, while the Qur’an calls for them: «And your Lord creates what He wishes and chooses. The choice was not for them. Glorified be Allah and Exalted is He above what they associate.» (28:68) And He said: «And it is not for a believing man nor a believing woman, if Allah and His Messenger decide a matter, that they have the choice in their matter.» (33:36) And He said: «What is it with you? How do you judge? Or do you have a book in which you learn, that indeed, for you is what you choose? Or do you have oaths upon Us, extending until the Day of Resurrection, that indeed, for you is to judge? Ask them which of them are, for that, claimers. Or do they have associates? Then let them bring their associates, if they were truthful.» (68:37-41) And He said: «Do they not contemplate on the Qur’an, or are their locks upon certain hearts?» (47:24) Or did Allah seal their hearts, and so they do not know? Or «They said: We wear, but they do not hear. Indeed, the worst living creatures for Allah are the deaf, the dumb, who do not use reason. And if Allah had knew in them any good, He would, verily, have made them hear, and if He had made them hear, they would, verily, turn away while they are refusing.» (8:21-23) Or: «They said: We have heard, and we disobey» (2:93). Rather, it is the favor of Allah which He gives to whom He wishes, and Allah is the One of Virtue, the Almighty. Hence, how is it for them to choose the Imam, when the Imam is knowledgeable who is not ignorant, a caller who does not deter, the core of holiness, purity, devoutness, ascetism, knowledge and worship? He is specified with the call of the Messenger, the progeny of the Pure, the Batul, there is no flaw in him with regards to lineage, nor is anyone with nobility near to him. The house is from Quraish, the prime is from Hashim, the Progeny is from the Family of the Messenger, the satisfaction is from Allah, the honor of all honors, the branch is from Abd Manaf, the one with growing knowledge, with complete rule, an expert in trust, knowledgeable in politics, to whom obedience is obligatory, rising with the order of Allah, an aid to the servants of Allah, a protector of the Religion of Allah. Indeed, the Prophets and Imams are given success by Allah, and He grants them from the Hidden of His Knowledge and Wisdom what He does not grant others, and so their knowledge is above the knowledge of the people of their age, in accordance to the saying of Him, Exalted is He: «So is He who guides to the truth more rightful to be followed, or he who does not guide, except that he is guided? So what is it with you? How do you judge?» (10:35) And His saying: «And he who is given wisdom, has, certainly, been given much good.» (2:269) And His saying about Talut: «Indeed, Allah chose him over you and increased him abundantly in knowledge and stature. And Allah grants His sovereignty to whom He wishes. And Allah is Encompassing, All-Knowing.» (2:247) And He said to His Prophet, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family: «He sent down unto you the Book and the wisdom, and He taught you what you did not know. And the favor of Allah upon you is ever great.» (4:113). And He said about the Imams from his Household, Progeny and Offspring, Allah’s blessings be upon him: «Or do they envy people for what Allah has granted them from His favor? For indeed, We have granted the Family of Ibrahim the Book and the wisdom, and We granted them a great kingdom. Then, among them were those who believed in him, and among them were those who drove away from it. And Hell is sufficient as a blaze.» (4:54-55) Indeed, if a servant is selected by Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, for the matters of His servants, He will expand his chest for that and entrust in his heart the wells of wisdom, and He will inspire to him knowledge, an inspiration, after which he will not be tired for an answer, nor will he be confused in it away from the correctness, while he is protected, assisted, given success and set firm, having been safeguarded from error, slipping and unintentional mistakes. He will be specified with that by Allah that he might be His Proof over His servants and His witness over His creation, and that is the favor of Allah, which He grants to whomever He wishes, and Allah is the One of great bestowal of favor. So, are they able to such as this? Or will their chosen be with this characteristic, by which they will put him forward? They have distanced, by the House of Allah, from the truth and discarded the Book of Allah behind their backs as if they do not know, whereas in the Book of Allah lies guidance and cure, but they discarded it and followed their desires, and so Allah condemned, detested them and made the miserable, so He, Exalted and Glorious is He, said: «And who is more aberrant than the one who follows his desire without guidance from Allah? Indeed, Allah does not guide the wrong-doing people.» (28:50) And He said: «Hence, misery is for them, and their acts are aberrant.» (47:8) And He said: «Great is the detest in the sight of Allah and the sight of those who have believed. That is how Allah seals upon every arrogant, tyrannical, heart.» (40:35)"

He said: With certain characteristics, of which the first is an affirmation from Allah, Blessed and Exalted is He, for him and His assignment of him as a Banner for the people that there might be an argument upon them,, because the Messenger of Allah, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, assigned Ali, peace be upon him, and made the people know him with his name, and he appointed him. So are the Imams, peace be upon them; the first assigns the second. Moreover, it is that he is asked, and answers, and that it is silent about him, to which he takes initiative, and that he informs people of what is to happen tomorrow, and that he speaks to people in every tongue and language."

Meanwhile, Abu’l-Hasan, peace be upon him, was facing a people which he was speaking to, and he heard the statement of Zaid, so he turned to him and said: O Zaid, have you been conceited by the saying of a food merchant in Kufa with regards to that Fatima shielded her private organ, to which Allah forbade her offspring from the Fire? By Allah, that for none but Hasan, Hussain and the children from her belly, exclusively. If Musa bin Ja’far, peace be upon them both, was obeying Allah, fasting during his day and standing during his night for prayer, and you would disobey him, and then you would both come on the Day of Resurrection as equal, you will, verily, be more honored to Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, than him. Indeed, Ali bin Hussain, peace be upon them both, used to say: To the one who is good to us are two portions of reward, and to the one who harms us are two multiples of torment. Hasan al-Washha’ said: Then he turned to me and said: O Hasan, how do you recite this verse: «He said: O Nuh, he is, indeed, not from your family; he is, indeed, an act that is not righteous» (11:46)? So I said: Among the people are those who recite: «he is, indeed, an act that is not righteous» and among them are those who recite: «he is, indeed, from the act [1] of one who is not righteous». The one who recites: «he is, indeed, from the act [2] of one who is not righteous» has negated him from his father. Then he, peace be upon him, said: «No, he was, certainly, his son, however, when he disobeyed Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, Allah negated him from his father.

We were told by Ahmad bin Muhammed bin Haitham al-‘Ajali, may Allah be pleased with him, that he said: We were told by Abu’l-Abbas, Ahmad bin Yahya bin Zakariya al-Qattan, that he said: We were told by Abu Muhammed, Bikr bin Abdullah bin Habib, that he said: We were told by Tamim bin Buhlul, from his father, from Muhammed bin Sinan, from Mufaddal bin Umar, that he said: Abu Abdillah, peace be upon him, said: Indeed, Allah, Blessed and Exalted is He, created the souls before the bodies by two thousand years, and He made the most sublime and honored of them the souls of Muhammed, Ali, Fatima, Hasan, Hussain and the Imams after them, Allah’s blessings be upon them. Then he presented it upon the Heavens, the earth and the mountains, and their light covered them, and Allah, Blessed and Exalted is He, said to the Heavens, the earth and the mountains: These are My Beloved, My Viceregents, My Proof upon My creation and the Imams of My living creatures. I have not created a creation that is more beloved to Me than them; to those who befriend them, I have created My Paradise, and to those who oppose them and antagonize them, I have created My Fire. Hence, the one who proclaims their rank from Me and position from My Mightiness, I will torment him a torment I will not torment anyone from all the worlds, and I will make him among the polytheists in the lowest level of My Fire, and the one who acknowledges their Divine Authority and does not proclaim their rank from Me and position from My Mightiness, I will make him among them in the Gardens of My Paradise, and they will have in it what they wish from Me, and I will permit for them My Generosity, allow for them My Vicinity and I will intercede for them among the sinners of My servants and maids. Thus, their Divine Authority is a trust for My creation. So, who of you will carry it with its weights and proclaim it for himself, other than My Chosen? Then the Heavens, the earth and the mountains refused to carry it, and they feared from proclaiming its rank and wishing for its position from the Mightiness of their Lord. Then, when Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, made Adam and his wife settle in the Garden, He said to them both: «Eat, both of you, from it abundantly how you wish, and do not come near this tree» - referring to the tree of wheat - «lest you become among the wrongdoers.» (2:35) Then they looked at the rank of Muhammed, Ali, Fatima, Hasan, Hussain and the Imams after them, Allah’s blessings be upon them, and they found them the most honored ranks of the people of the Garden, so they said: O our Lord, to whom is this rank? Then Allah, Glorified be His Glory, said: Raise, both of you, your heads towards the leg of My Throne. So they raised their heads and found the name of Muhammed, Ali, Fatima, Hasan, Hussain and the Imams after them, Allah’s blessings be upon them, written on the leg of the Throne with a Light from the Light of the Omnipotent, Glorified be His Glory, and said: O our Lord, how dignified are the people of this rank to You, and how beloved are they to You, and how honored are them to You. Then Allah, Glorified be His Glory, said: Were it not for them, I would not have created both of you. These are the Keeprs of My Knowledge and My Trustees over My Secret; beware, both of you, from looking at them with the eye of jealousy and wishing their rank to Me and their position from My Generosity, lest you enter into My prohibition and disobedience, by which you become among the wrongdoers. They said: Our Lord, and who are the wrongdoers? He said: The proclaimers of their rank without right. They said: Our Lord, then show us the ranks of their wringers in Your Fire that we might see them, like how we saw their rank in Your Garden. Then Allah, Blessed and Exalted is He, ordered the Fire and it displayed all that was in it from the kinds of exemplary punishment and torture, and He, Exalted and Glorious is He, said: The place of those who wrong them, those who proclaimed their rank, are in the lowest level of it; whenever they want to exit it, they are returned to it, and whenever their skins grow, they are replaced by others, that they might taste the torment. O Adam and O Hawwa’, do not look at My Lights and Proofs with the eye of jealousy, lest I make you descend from My Vicinity and afflict you with My ignominy. Then the Devil whispered to them to make apparent to them what was ignited of them with regards to their misdeeds, and he said: The prohibition to you of your Lord from this tree is for not but if you are two Angels or among the ever-dwelling. He then swore to them: Indeed, I am to you, from the advisors. Then he lead them with conceit and carried them to wish for their rank, and they looked at them with the eye of jealously, and so, they were abandoned until they ate from the tree of wheat. Then, the spot from which they ate turned into barley, and the root of the wheat was all from that which they did not eat, and the root of the barley was all from that which returned in the spot they ate from. Then, when they ate from the tree, the ornaments and the covers flew away from their bodies and they remained naked, and they immediately began mending them with leaves of the Garden. Their Lord then called to them: Did I not forbid you from that tree and say to you: Indeed, the Devil is to you a clear enemy? Then they said: Our Lord, we have wronged ourselves, and if You do not forgive us and grant us mercy, we will, verily, be among the loosers. He said: Descend from My Vicinity, for they will not be near Me in My Garden, those who disobey Me. Then they descended, having been entrusted to themselves with regards to seeking sustenance. When Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, wanted to accept their repentance, Jibra’eel came to them and said to them: Indeed, you only wronged yourselves by wishing for the rank of those who were preferred over you, and hence, your reward is what you have been punished with regarding descendance from the Vicinity of Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, to His ground. Therefore, ask your Lord by the Names which you saw on the leg of the Throne that He might accept your repentance. Then they said: O Allah, indeed, we ask you by those who are the Most Dignified to you, Muhammed, Ali, Fatima, Hasan, Hussain and the Imams, peace be upon them, that, pleadingly, You accept our repentance and grant us mercy. Then Allah accepted their repentance, He is, indeed, the Acceptor of Repentance, the All-Merciful. The Prophets of Allah did not cease, guarding this trust and informing with it to their Successors and the sincere from their nations, but they would refuse to carry it and are frightened from proclaiming it, and it has been carried by the human being who knows. Hence, the origin of every wrong-doing is from it, till the Day of Resurrection, and that is the saying of Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He: «Indeed, We presented the trust upon the Heavens, the earth and the mountains, but they refused to carry it and feared it, and it was carried by the human being. He is, indeed, wrong-doing, ignorant.» (33:72)"

We were told by my father, may Allah be pleased with him, that he said: We were told by Sa’d bin Abdullah, that he said: We were told by Ahmad ibn Muhammed bin Isa, that he said: We were told by Abbas bin Ma’ruf, from Abdullah bin Mughaira, that he said: We were told by Abu Hafs al-‘Abdi, that he said: We were told by Abu Harun al-‘Abdi, from Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri, that he said: The Messenger of Allah, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, said: If you ask Allah for my sake, then ask Him about the Means. Then we asked the Prophet, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, about the Means, so he said: It is my degree in Paradise, and it is a thousand stairs, between one stair to another stair is the running of the fast horse for a month, and it is what is between the stair of an element, to a stair of peridot, to a stair of ruby, to a stair of gold, to a stair of silver. They will be brought on the Day of Resurrection that they might be raised with the degree of Prophets. It is, among the degree of the Prophets, like the moon among planets. There will not remain on that day a Prophet, nor a truthful nor a martyr, except that he will say: Tuba iso for the one whose degree is this degree. Then the call will come from Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, which will be heard by the Prophets and all the creation: This is the degree of Muhammed. Then, on that day, I will come, wrapped in soft cloth of light, on the Crown of the Kingdom and Diadem of Dignity, while Ali ibn Abi Talib is front of me and in his hand is my Banner, that is the Banner of Praise on which it is written: «There is no god but Allah, the Successful are those who won with Allah». When we will pass by the Prophets, they will say: «These are two Angels brought near (to Allah) we do not know and whom we have not seen» and when we pass by the Angels, they will say: «Prophets who have been sent», and so, until I will raise through the degree and Ali will follow me until I become at the highest degree of it, while Ali is beneath me by one degree. There will remain, on that day, no Prophet, nor truthful nor martyr, except that he says: Tuba is for these two servants, how much are they dignified by Allah, Exalted is He! Then the call will come from Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, which will be heard by the Prophets, the truthful, the martyrs and the believers: This is My Beloved, Muhammed, and this is My Viceregent, Ali. Tuba is for the one who loves him, and woe to the one who hates him and lies about him. It will remain, on that day, none who loves you, O Ali, except that he finds comfort in this speech, his face is whitened and his heart is rejoiced, and it will remain none who antagonizes you, wages war against you or knowingly rejects your right, except that his face is darkened and his feet are disturbed. While I am as such, two Angels will approach me. As for one of them, he is Ridwan, the Guardian of Paradise, and as for the other, he is Malik, the Guardian of the Fire, and Ridwan will come near and say: Peace be upon you, O Ahmad. I will say: Peace be upon you, O Angel. Who are you? For how good is your face and delightful is your fragrance! Then he will say: I am Ridwan, the Guardian of Paradise, and these are the keys of Paradise; they were sent to you by the Lord of Honor, so take them, O Ahmad. Then I will say: I have, certainly, accepted that from my Lord, so, to Him is praise for what my Lord has preferred me with. I will give them to my brother, Ali bin Abi Talib, and so it will be given to Ali. Then Ridwan will return and Malik will come near and say: Peace be upon you, O Ahmad. I will then say: Upon you is peace, O Angle. How ugly is your face and horrid is your look. Who are you? He will say: I am Malik, the Guardian of the Fire, and these are the keys to the Fire; they were sent to you by the Lord of Honor, so take them, O Ahmad. Then I will say: I have, certainly, accepted that from my Lord, so, to Him is praise for what my Lord has preferred me with. I will give them to my brother, Ali bin Abi Talib, and so he will give it to him. Then Malik will return, and Ali will approach and with him are the keys to Paradise and the keys to the Fire, until he stands at the edge of the Fire, while its sparks fly away, its blaze heightens and heat intensifies, while Ali is holding by its ropes, to which Hell will say to him: Cut me off, O Ali, for indeed, your light has extinguished my flame. Then Ali will say to it: Be cold, O Hell, take him, and leave him; take my enemy, and leave my ally.

We were told by Abdul-Wahid bin Muhammed bin ‘Abdous al-Naisabouri al-‘Attar, may Allah grant him mercy, that he said: We were told by Ali bin Muhammed bin Qutayba, from Hamdan bin Sulayman, from Abdul-Salam bin Saleh al-Harawi, that he said: I said to al-Rida, peace be upon him: O son of Allah’s Messenger, inform me about the Tree from which Adam and Hawwa’ ate, what was it? For certainly, the people have differed about him, for among them are those who narrate that it was wheat, and among them are those who narrate that it was grape, and among them are those who narrate that it was the Tree of Jealousy. Then he said: All of that is true. I said: Then what is the meaning of these indications, with their differences? Then he said: O Abu’l-Silt, indeed, the Tree of the Garden carries several types. Hence, it was a tree of wheat, and in it was grape, and it is not like the tree of this world. Indeed, when Adam, peace be upon him, was honored by Allah, Exalted be His Mentioning, by making the prostration of His Angels to him and by making him enter the Garden, he said in himself: Did Allah create a human being better than me? Then Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, knew what occurred in him, so He called unto him: Raise your head, O Adam, and look at the leg of the Throne. Then Adam raised his head and looked at the leg of the Throne and found on it written: «There is no god but Allah, Muhammed is the Messenger of Allah, Ali ibn Abi Talib is the Commander of the Believers, his wife, Fatima, is the Mistress of the women of all the worlds, Hasan and Hussain are the two Masters of the young among the people of Paradise». Then Adam said: O Lord, who are these? Then He, Exalted and Glorious is He, said: O Adam, these are your offspring, and they are better than you and than all of My creation, and were it not for them, I would not have created you, nor had I created Paradise, the Fire, Heaven and earth. Hence, beware from looking at them with the eye of jealousy, lest I expel you from My Vicinity. Then he looked at them with the eye of jealousy and wished their position, and so Shaytan seized control over him to the extent that he ate from the tree which he had been forbidden from, and he seized control over Hawwa’ due to her look at Fatima with the eye of jealousy to the extent that she ate from the tree like how Adam ate. Then Allah took them out of His Garden and made them descend, away from His Vicinity, to earth."

تعالى ذكره - والآخر جائز فأما ما يستحيل فهو أن يختبره ليعلم ما تكشف الأيام عنه وهذا مالا يصلح لأنه عز وجل علام الغيوب، والضرب الاخر من الابتلاء أن يبتليه حتى يصبر فيما يبتليه به فيكون ما يعطيه من العطاء على سبيل الاستحقاق ولينظر إليه الناظر فيقتدي به فيعلم من حكمة الله عز وجل أنه لم يكل أسباب الإمامة الا إلى الكافي المستقل الذي كشفت الأيام عنه بخبره. فأما الكلمات فمنها ما ذكرناه، ومنها اليقين وذلك قول الله عز وجل: "" وكذلك نري إبراهيم ملكوت السماوات والأرض وليكون من الموقنين "" ومنها المعرفة بقدم بارئه وتوحيده وتنزيهه عن التشبيه حتى نظر إلى الكواكب والقمر والشمس فاستدل بأفول كل واحد منها على حدثه وبحدثه على محدثه ، ثم علمه عليه السلام بأن الحكم بالنجوم خطأ في قوله عز وجل: "" فنظر نظرة في النجوم * فقال إني سقيم "" وإنما قيده الله سبحانه بالنظرة الواحدة لان النظرة الواحدة لا توجب الخطأ إلا بعد النظرة الثانية بدلالة قول النبي صلى الله عليه وآله لما قال لأمير المؤمنين عليه السلام: "" يا علي أول النظرة لك والثانية عليك ولا لك ""، ومنها الشجاعة وقد كشفت الأيام عنه بدلالة قوله عز وجل: "" إذ قال لأبيه وقومه ما هذه التماثيل التي أنتم لها عاكفون * قالوا وجدنا آباءنا لها عابدين * قال لقد كنتم أنتم وآباؤكم في ضلال مبين * قالوا أجئتنا بالحق أم أنت من اللاعبين * قال بل ربكم رب السماوات والأرض الذي فطرهن وأنا على ذلكم من الشاهدين * وتا الله لأكيدن أصنامكم بعد أن تولوا مدبرين * فجعلهم جذاذا إلا كبيرا لهم لعلهم إليه يرجعون "" ومقاومة الرجل الواحد الوفا من أعداء الله عز وجل تمام الشجاعة، ثم الحلم مضمن معناه في قوله عز وجل: "" إن إبراهيم لحليم أواه منيب "" ثم السخاء وبيانه في حديث ضيف إبراهيم المكرمين، ثم العزلة عن أهل البيت والعشيرة مضمن معناه في قوله: "" وأعتزلكم وما تدعون من دون الله -

"" الآية "" - ولو خالف ذلك لكان داخلا في قوله: "" ومن يرغب عن ملة إبراهيم إلا من سفه نفسه "" جل نبي الله عليه السلام عن ذلك، فقال الله عز وجل: "" إن أولى الناس بإبراهيم للذين اتبعوه وهذا النبي والذين آمنوا "". وأمير المؤمنين عليه السلام أبو ذرية النبي صلى الله عليه وآله ووضع الإمامة فيه ووضعها في ذريته المعصومين بعده. قوله عز وجل: "" لا ينال عهدي الظالمين "" يعني بذلك أن الإمامة لا تصلح لمن قد عبد وثنا أو صنما أو أشرك بالله طرفة عين وإن أسلم بعد ذلك، والظلم وضع الشئ في غير موضعه وأعظم الظلم الشرك، قال الله عز وجل: "" إن الشرك لظلم عظيم "" وكذلك لا يصلح للإمامة من قد ارتكب من المحارم شيئا صغيرا كان أو كبيرا وإن تاب منه بعد ذلك و كذلك لا يقيم الحد من في جنبه حد فإذا لا يكون الامام إلا معصوما ولا تعلم عصمة إلا بنص الله عز وجل عليه على لسان نبيه صلى الله عليه وآله لان العصمة ليست في ظاهر الخلقة فترى كالسواد والبياض وما أشبه ذلك، فهي مغيبة لا تعرف إلا بتعريف علام الغيوب عز وجل.","1. We were told by Ali bin Ahmad bin Muhammed bin Imran al-Daqqaq, may Allah be pleased with him, that he said: We were told by Hamza bin Qasim al-Alawi al-Abbasi, that he said: We were told by Ja’far bin Muhammed bin Malik al-Kufi al-Fazari, that he said: We were told by Muhammed bin Hussain bin Zaid, the Oilman, that he said: We were told by Muhammed bin Ziyad al-Azdi, from Mufaddal bin Umar, from al-Sadiq, Ja’far bin Muhammed, peace be upon them both, that he said: I asked him about the saying of Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He: «And when Ibrahim was tested by his Lord with Words» (2:124). What are these Words? He said: They are the Words which Adam received from his Lord, after which He accepted his repentance, and it is that he said: «O Lord, I ask you by the right of Muhammed, Ali, Fatima, Hasan and Hussain, I beg that You accept my repentance» after which Allah accepted his repentance, and He is the Accepter of Repentence, the Merciful. Then I said to him: O son of Allah’s Messenger, then what does He, Exalted and Glorious is He, mean with His saying: «completed them»? He said: He means that he completed them until the Riser, peace be upon him, twelve Imams, nine from the sons of Hussain, peace be upon him. Mufaddal said: Then I said to him: O son of Allah’s Messenger, then inform me about the saying of Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He: «And He made it a remaining Word among his descendants» (43:28)? He said: By that He means the Imamate; Allah made it among the descendants of Hussain until the Day of Resurrection. He said: Then I said to him: O son of Allah’s Messenger, then how did the Imamate become among the sons of Hussain, not the sons of Hasan, when they are both the sons of Allah’s Messenger, his grandsons and the Masters of the youth among the people of Paradise? Then he, peace be upon him, said: Indeed, Musa and Harun were two Prophets, Messengers and brothers, and Allah made the Prophethood in the backbone of Harun, not the backbone of Musa, and it was allowed not for anyone to say: Why did Allah do that? For indeed, the Imamate is the Successorship of Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He. None is allowed to say: «Why did Allah make it in the backbone of Hussain, not the backbone of Hasan» because Allah, Blessed and Exalted is He, is the Wise in His actions; He is not asked about what He does, whereas they will be asked. For [1] the saying of Allah, Exalted is He: «And when Ibrahim was tested by his Lord with Words» is another indication, and what we mentioned is its origin. Testing is of two kinds: one of them is impossible for Allah, Exalted be His Mentioning; and the other is possible. As for the one that is impossible, it is that He tests him by what the days will reveal about him. This is not right, because He, Exalted and Glorious is He, is the Knower of unseen things. The other kind of testing is that He tests him until he is patient with what He tests him with, and then, what He will give him of grants is in the form of deservingness, and that the looker may look at him, follow him and know from the Wisdom of Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, that the causes of Imamate lie with none but the Sufficient, the Independent, whom the days have revealed his news. As for the Words, among them is what we have mentioned. Also, among them is certainty, and that is the saying of Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He: «And in that manner We show Ibrahim the Kingdom of the Heavens and the earth, and that he might be among the certain» (6:75). Also, among them is conscious knowledge of the Ancientness of His Creator, His Oneness and declaring His innocence from resemblance, until he looked at the planets, the moon and the sun and denoted with the setting of each one of them that it has come to existence, and with its coming to existence (he denoted) to their Causer to exist. Furthermore, He taught him, peace be upon him, that judging with the stars is wrong, as in the saying of Hi, Exalted and Glorious is He: «Then he cast a look at the stars, and he said: Indeed, I am about to become ill.» (37:88-89) Allah only restricted him with one look because one look does not bring about an error except after the second look, by the denotation of the saying of the Prophet, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, when he said to the Commander of the Believers, peace be upon him: «O Ali, the first look is (permissible) for you, and the second is (forbidden) upon you, not (allowed) to you.» Also, among them is bravery. Days have revealed it, by the denotation the saying of Him, Exalted and Glorious is He: «As he said to his fosterer and people: What are these statues to which you are devoted? They said: We have found our fathers, of them, worshippers. He said: Certainly, you and your fathers have been in clear aberration. They said: Have you come to us with the truth, or are you one of those who jest? He said: Rather, your Lord is the Lord of the Heavens and the earth, who split them, and I am, to that, of those who testify. And by Allah, I will harm your idols after you leave, having turned away. Then he made them into fragments, except for a large one among them, that they might return.» (21:52-58) The resistance of one man to thousands of the enemies of Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, is the completion of bravery. Furthermore, the meaning of forbearance is included in the saying of Him, Exalted and Glorious is He: «Indeed, Ibrahim is, verily, forbearing, grieving and and frequently returning.» (11:75) Furthermore, it is openhandedness, and its clarification is in the narration of Ibrahim’s honored guest. Furthermore, the meaning of isolation from the household and the clan is included in His saying: «And I will isolate from you and what you call upon besides Allah» (19:48) - the verse. With regards to enjoining good and forbidding evil, the clarification of that in the saying of Him, Exalted and Glorious is He: «O fosterer, why do you worship that which does not hear, nor sees nor avails you at all? O fosterer, indeed, it has, verily, came to me of knowledge what has not come to you, so follow me, I will lead you an even path. O fosterer, do not worship Shaytan. Indeed, Shaytan was for the Merciful, gravely disobedient. O fosterer, indeed, I fear that it afflicts you punishment from the Merciful, by which you become to Shaytan a befriender.» (19:42-45) With regards to repelling the bad with the good deed, it is when his father said to him: «Are you desiring away from my gods, O Ibrahim? Certainly, if you do not stop, I will, verily, stone you, so abstain from me for a prolonged time» (19:46) and then he said in reply to his fosterer: «Peace be upon you. I will ask forgiveness for you from Lord. Indeed, He is to me ever Hospitable.» (19:47) With regards to trust in Allah, its clarification is in His saying: «And He who created me, and so, He guides me, and He who feeds me and gives me drink, and when I am ill, He heals me, and He who makes me die, then revives me, and He whom I seek will forgive me my grave mistake on the Day of Judgement.» (26:78-82) Furthermore, with regards to rulership and association with the righteous, it is in His saying: «My Lord, grant me rulership and join me with the righteous» (26:83). It means the righteous who do not rule except by the judgement of Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, and do not rule by opinions and analogies, until it is testified for him, by those who will be after him of Proofs, with truthfulness. The clarification of that is in His saying: «And make for me a reputation of truthfulness among the descendants.» (26:84) With this he intended the virtuous nation, and so Allah responded to him and made for him and others of His Prophets a reputation of truthfulness among the descendants, that is Ali bin Abi Talib, peace be upon him. That is His saying: «And We made for them a reputation of truthfulness, Ali.» (19:50) [2] The ordeal with himself was when he was placed in the catapult and thrown with it into the fire. Then, it was the ordeal with his son, when he was commanded to slaughter his son, Isma’il. Then, it was the ordeal with the family, when Allah saved his sanctity [3] from the ill manners of the Coptic, in the report that is mentioned about this story, and then it was patience with the ill manners of Sara. Then, it was limiting oneself in obedience, as in His saying: «And do not disgrace me on the Day they are resurrected.» (26:87) Then, it was moral correctness, as in the saying of Him, Exalted and Glorious is He: «Ibrahim was neither Jewish nor Christian, however, he was an orthodox, Submitter, and he was not from the polytheists.» (3:67) Then, it was the combining of the conditions of words, as in His saying: «Indeed, my prayer, my asceticism, my living and my dying are for Allah, the Lord of all the worlds, He has no associate. By that I was ordered, and I am the first of the Submitters.» (6:162-163) He gathered in His saying: «my living and my dying are for Allah» the total conditions of acts of obedience, all of them, so that no thing from them is unincluded, and that no meaning from it is absent. Moreover, Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, responded to his call when he said: «My Lord, show me how You revive the dead» (2:260). This verse’s denotation is inexact, and its meaning is: He asked about the state of things, and the state of things is from the actions of Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He. When a knowledgeable does not know it, no defect afflicts him nor does there appear any lack in his belief in Monotheism. Hence, Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, said: «Have you not believed? He said: Sure.» (2:260) This is the general condition of those who believe in Him, that whenever one of them is asked: «Have you not believed?», it becomes obligatory that he says: «Sure», like how Ibrahim said. When Allah, Exalted and Glorious, said to all the souls of the sons of Adam: «Am I not your Lord? They said: Sure.» (7:172) the first to say «Sure» was Muhammed, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, and so, he became with his precedence to «Sure», the Master of the first and the last, the best of the Prophets and Messengers. Hence, the one who does not answer this question with the answer of Ibrahim, he has desired other than his creed. Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, said: «And who desires other than the creed of Ibrahim except for he who ridicules himself?» (2:130) Then, Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, chose him in this world, and then it followed His testimony for him with regards to fate that he is among the righteous, in the saying of Him, Exalted and Glorious is He: «We have, certainly, chosen him in this world, and he is, indeed, in the Hereafter, verily, among the Righteous.» (2:130) The Righteous are the Prophet and the Imams, Allah’s blessings be upon them, who took from Allah His commandment and prohibition, who appeal for righteousness from Him, who avoid own opinions and analogy with regards to His Religion, as in the saying of Him, Exalted and Glorious is He: «As his Lord said to him: Submit. He said: I have submitted to the Lord of all the worlds.» (2:131) Then, it was the following of those after him of the Prophets, peace be upon him, to him, as in His saying: «And Ibrahim bequeathed with it to his sons and Ya’qoub: O son, indeed, Allah has chosen for you the Religion, so, do not die except that you are Submitters.» As well as in the saying of Him, Exalted and Glorious is He, to His Prophet, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family: «Then We revealed to: Follow the creed of Ibrahim, orthodoxly, and he was not from the polytheists.» (16:124) As well as in the saying of Him, Exalted and Glorious is He: «The creed of your father, Ibrahim. He named you Submitters from before.» (22:79) The conditions of the words of the Imam are taken from what is needed by the nation from the aspect of the interests of this world and the Hereafter. With regards to the saying of Ibrahim, peace be upon him: «and from my progeny» (2:124), «from» is a letter of the partitive, that it may be known that from the progeny are those who deserve Imamate, and that among them are those who do not deserve it. This is from the (opinion of the) majority of the Muslims, and that is due to it being impermissible for Ibrahim to pray for a disbeliever that he is granted Imamate and for a Muslim who is not Infallible. Hence, the valid is that the partitive applies on some specific ones among the believers, and the specific only became specific by distancing from disbelief. Moreover, the one who abstains major sins becomes, from the specific, (even) more specific. Furthermore, an Infallible is the more specified among the specified, and if there was for the specification a form that is higher of rank than it, then this would have been made among the characteristics of the Imam, as Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, named Isa as being from the progeny of Ibrahim, when he was the son of his daughter after him. Hence, since it is right for the son of a daughter to be from the progeny, and that Ibrahim prayed for his progeny that they be granted Imamate, it would be necessary for Muhammed, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, to follow him with regards to placing Imamate in the Infallibles among his progeny, like the following of (the footstep of) one sandal to another sandal, after Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, had revealed to him and judged for him by His saying: «Then We revealed to: Follow the creed of Ibrahim, orthodoxly» (16:123) the verse. If he had opposed that, he would have been included by His saying: «And who desires other than the creed of Ibrahim except for he who ridicules himself?» (2:130) May a Prophet of Allah, peace be upon him, be glorified above such, for Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, has said: «Indeed, those of the people who are the most rightful to Ibrahim, are, verily, those who followed him, and this Prophet and those who have believed.» (3:68) The Commander of the Believers, peace be upon him, is the father of the progeny of the Prophet, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, and he had placed Imamate in him, and he placed it in his progeny, the Infallibles, after him. The saying of Him, Exalted and Glorious is He: «My Covenant does not include the wrongdoers.» (2:124) With that He meant that Imamate does not suit for the one who has worshipped an idol or statue or who has associated partners with Allah with (as much as) a blink of an eye, even if he had accepted Islam after that. Wrongdoing is to place something in other than its place, and the greatest of that is polytheism. Allah, Exalted and Glorious, said: «Indeed, polytheism is a great wrongdoing.» (31:13) Similarly, it does not suit for Imamate, the one who has committed forbidden acts, be it a small or a big thing, even if he had repented after it. Similarly, it may not be carried out the fixated punishment by the one for whom is a fixated punishment (to be carried out). Hence, the Imam is nothing but Infallible, and Infallibility is not known except by an affirmation of Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, on the tongue of His Prophet, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, because Infallibility is not in the apparent disposition in which you may see blackness, whiteness and so on. Rather, it is hidden, not recognized except by specification of the Knower of Hidden Things, Exalted and Glorious is He."

Indeed, I asked him one day about an Imam: Is he Infallible? He said: Yes. Then I said: Then I said: Then what is the characteristic of Infallibility in him? And by what thing is he recognized? Then he said: Indeed, all sins have four indications, and there is no fifth to them: craving, jealousy, anger and desire. These are negated from him; it is not possible that he is craving for this world when it is under his seal, because he is the Guardian of the Muslims, so for what does he crave? Also, it is not possible that he is jealous, because a human is only jealous of the one who is above him, and there is none above him, so how can he be jealous of the one who is beneath him? Also, it is not possible that he is angered for something of this world, except if his anger is for Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, for indeed, Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, has imposed upon him to carry out fixated punishments and for him to not be taken by the blame of a blamer nor compassion with regards to His Religion until he carries out the fixated punishments of Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He. Also, it is not possible for him to follow desires and prefer this world over the Hereafter, because Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, made the Hereafter more beloved to him, like how He made for us (by disposition) this world more beloved, for he looks at the Hereafter like how we look at this world.

1,Chapter 64 | The meaning of the Infallibility of the Imam,Ḥadīth #4,قال أبو جعفر مصنف هذا الكتاب: الدليل على عصمة الامام أنه لما كان كل كلام ينقل عن قائله يحتمل وجوها من التأويل وكان أكثر القرآن والسنة مما أجمعت الفرق على أنه صحيح لم يغير ولم يبدل ولم يزد فيه ولم ينقص منه محتملا لوجوه كثيرة من التأويل وجب أن يكون مع ذلك مخبر صادق معصوم من تعمد الكذب والغلط، منبئ عما عنى الله ورسوله في الكتاب والسنة على حق ذلك وصدقه، لان الخلق مختلفون في التأويل، كل فرقة تميل مع القرآن والسنة إلى مذهبها، فلو كان الله تبارك وتعالى تركهم بهذه الصفة من غير مخبر عن كتابه صادق فيه لكان قد سوغهم الاختلاف في الدين ودعاهم إليه إذ أنزل كتابا يحتمل التأويل وسن نبيه صلى الله عليه وآله سنة يحتمل التأويل وأمرهم بالعمل بهما، فكأنه قال: تأولوا واعملوا. وفي ذلك إباحة العمل بالمتناقضات والاعتماد للحق وخلافه. فلما استحال ذلك على الله عز وجل وجب أن يكون مع القرآن والسنة في كل عصر من يبين عن المعاني التي عناها الله عز وجل في القرآن بكلامه دون ما يحتمله ألفاظ القرآن من التأويل ويبين عن المعاني التي عناها رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله في سننه وأخباره دون التأويل الذي يحتمله ألفاظ الاخبار المروية عنه عليه السلام المجمع على صحة نقلها، وإذا وجب أنه لا بد من مخبر صادق وجب أن لا يجوز عليه الكذب تعمدا ولا الغلط فيما يخبر به عن مراد الله عز وجل في كتابه وعن مراد رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله في أخباره وسننه، و إذا وجب ذلك وجب أنه معصوم. ومما يؤكد هذا الدليل أنه لا يجوز عند مخالفينا أن يكون الله عز وجل أنزل القرآنعلى أهل عصر النبي صلى عليه وآله ولا نبي فيهم ويتعبدهم بالعمل بما فيه على حقه و صدقه فإذا لم يجز أن ينزل القرآن على قوم ولا ناطق به ولا معبر عنه ولا مفسر لما استعجم منه ولا مبين لوجهه فكذلك لا يجوز أن نتعبد نحن به إلا ومعه من يقوم فينا مقام النبي صلى الله عليه وآله في قومه وأهل عصره في التبيين لناسخه ومنسوخه وخاصه وعامه، و المعاني التي عناها الله عز وجل بكلامه، دون ما يحتمله التأويل، كما كان النبي صلى الله عليه وآله مبينا لذلك كله لأهل عصره ولا بد من ذلك ما لزموا العقول والدين. فإن قال قائل: إن المودي إلينا ما نحتاج إلى علمه من متشابه القرآن ومن معانيه التي عناها الله دون ما يحتمله ألفاظه هو الأمة. أكذبه اختلاف الأمة وشهادتها بأجمعها على أنفسها في كثير من آي القرآن لجهلهم بمعناه الذي عناه الله عز وجل، وفي ذلك بيان أن الأمة ليست هي المؤدية عن الله عز وجل ببيان القرآن، وأنها ليست تقوم في ذلك مقام النبي صلى الله عليه وآله. فإن تجاسر متجاسر فقال: قد كان يجوز أن ينزل القرآن على أهل عصر النبي صلى الله عليه وآله ولا يكون معه نبي ويتعبدهم بما فيه مع احتماله للتأويل. قيل له: فهب ذلك كان قد وقع من الخلاف في معانيه ما قد وقع في هذا الوقت ما الذي كانوا يصنعون؟ فإن قال: ما قد صنعوا الساعة. قيل: الذي فعلوه الساعة أخذ كل فرقة من الأمة جانبا من التأويل وعمله عليه وتضليل الفرقة المخالفة لها في ذلك وشهادتها عليها بأنها ليست على الحق. فإن قال: إنه كان يجوز أن يكون أول الاسلام كذلك وإن ذلك حكمة من الله و عدل فيهم. ركب خطأ عظيما وما لا أرى أحدا من الخلق يقدم عليه، فيقال له عند ذلك:فحدثنا إذا تهيأ للعرب الفصحاء أهل اللغة أن يتأولوا القرآن ويعمل كل واحد منهم بما يتأوله على اللغة العربية فكيف يصنع من لا يعرف اللغة من الناس؟ وكيف يصنع العجم من الترك والفرس؟ وإلى أي شئ يرجعون في علم ما فرض الله عليهم في كتابه؟ و من أي الفرق يقبلون مع اختلاف الفرق في التأويل وإباحتك كل فرقة أن تعمل بتأويلها فلا بد لك من أن تجري العجم ومن لا يفهم اللغة مجرى أصحاب اللغة من أن لهم أن يتبعوا أي الفرق شاؤوا. و [إلا] إن ألزمت من لا يفهم اللغة اتباع بعض الفرق دون بعض لزمك أنت تجعل الحق كله في تلك الفرقة دون غيرها، فإن جعلت الحق في فرقة دون فرقة نقضت ما بنيت عليه كلامك واحتجت إلى أن يكون مع تلك الفرقة علم وحجة تبين بها من غيرها وليس هذا من قولك لو جعلت الفرق كلها متساوية في الحق مع تناقض تأويلاتها فيلزمك أيضا أن تجعل للعجم ومن لا يفهم اللغة أن يتبعوا أي الفرق شاؤوا، وإذا فعلت ذلك لزمك في هذا الوقت أن لا تلزم أحدا من مخالفيك من الشيعة والخوارج وأصحاب التأويلات وجميع من خالفك ممن له فرقة ومن مبتدع لا فرقة له على مخالفيك ذما ، وهذا نقض الاسلام والخروج من الاجماع، ويقال لك: وما ينكر على هذا الاعطاء أن يتعبد الله عز وجل الخلق بما في كتاب مطبق لا يمكن أحدا أن يقرأ ما فيه ويأمر أن يبحثوا ويرتادوا ويعمل كل فرقة بما ترى أنه في الكتاب. فإن أجزت ذلك أجزت على الله عز وجل العبث لان ذلك صفة العابث، ويلزمك أن تجيز على كل من نظر بعقله في شئ واستحسن أمرا من الدين أن يعتقده لأنه سواء أباحهم أن يعملوا في أصول الحلال و الحرام وفروعها بآرائهم [أ] وأباحهم أن ينظروا بعقولهم في أصول الدين كله وفروعه من توحيده وغيره وأن يعملوا أيضا بما استحسنوه وكان عندهم حقا فإن أجزت ذلك أجزت على الله عز وجل أن يبيح الخلق أن يشهدوا عليه أنه ثاني اثنين، وأن يعتقدوا الدهر، وجحدوا البارئ جل وعز. وهذا آخر ما في هذا الكلام لان من أجاز أن يتعبدنا الله عز وجل بالكتاب على احتمال التأويل ولا مخبر صادق لنا عن معانيه لزمه أن يجيز على أهل عصر النبي صلى الله عليه وآله مثل ذلك وإذا أجاز مثل ذلك لزمه أن يبيح الله عز وجل كل فرقة العمل بما رأت وتأولت لأنه لا يكون لهم غير ذلك إذا لم يكن معهم حجة في أن هذا التأويل أصح من هذا التأويل، وإذا أباح ذلك أباح متبعهم ممن لا يعرف اللغة وإذا أباح أولئك أيضا لزمه أن يبيحنا في هذا العصر، وإذا أباحنا ذلك في الكتاب لزمه أن يبيحنا ذلك في أصول الحلال والحرام ومقائس العقول وذلك خروج من الدين كله، وإذا وجب بما قدمنا ذكره أنه لا بد من مترجم عن القرآن وأخبار النبي صلى الله عليه وآله وجب أن يكون معصوما ليجب القبول منه، فإذا وجب أن يكون معصوما بطل أن يكون هو الأمة لما بينا من اختلافاتها في تأويل القرآن والاخبار وتنازعها في ذلك ومن إكفار بعضها بعضا، وإذا ثبت ذلك وجب أن المعصوم هو الواحد الذي ذكرناه وهو الامام. وقد دللنا على أن الامام لا يكون إلا معصوما وأرينا أنه إذا وجبت العصمة في الامام لم يكن بد من أن ينص النبي صلى الله عليه وآله عليه لان العصمة ليست في ظاهر الخلقة فيعرفها الخلق بالمشاهدة فواجب أن ينص عليها علام الغيوب تبارك وتعالى على لسان نبيه صلى الله عليه وآله وذلك لان الامام لا يكون إلا منصوصا عليه. وقد صح لنا النص بما بيناه من الحجج وبما رويناه من الأخبار الصحيحة.,"Abu Ja’far, the compiler of this book, said: The evidence to the Imam’s Infallibility is that since every speech that is transmitted of a sayer is possible to have indications of interpretations, and since most of the Qur’an and the Tradition is what sects have gathered upon as being authentic, not having changed, nor replaced, nor having been increased with nor having been deducted from, are possible to have many indications of interpretation, it is necessary for there to be, with that, an informer who is truthful, protected from purposeful lying and mistake, predicting of what Allah and His Messenger meant in the Book and Tradition in its true and real sense. This is because the creation are disputed with regards to interpretation; every sect tendences along with the Qur’an and the Tradition towards its own opinions. If Allah, Blessed and Exalted is He, had left them in this case without an informer of His Book who is truthful about it, then He would have justified for them to be disputed in matters of religion, yet He would have called them to it, as He had sent down a Book that is possible to have several interpretations, and as His Prophet, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, established a Tradition that is possible to have several interpretations, and yet He has ordered them to act in accordance to it. It is as if He said: Interpret and act. In that lies permissibility of acting with contradictions and of relying on the truth and its opposite. Since that is impossible upon Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, it is necessary for there to be along with the Qur’an and the Tradition, in every age, one who clarifies the meanings which Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, meant in the Qur’an with His speech with other than what the terms of the Qur’an carries of possible interpretation, and who clarifies the meanings which the Messenger of Allah, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, meant in his Traditions and reports with other than the possible interpretation of the terms of the reports narrated of him, peace be upon him, on whose authenticity of transmission there is a consensus. If it is necessary that there must be a truthful informer, it is necessary for it to be impossible for him to purposely lie and err in his informing of the intention of Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, in His Book and the intention of Allah’s Messenger, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, in his reports and Traditions. Since this is necessary, it is necessary for him to be Infallible. What affirms this evidence is that it is not permissible to our opponents for Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, to have sent down the Qur’an to the people of the era of the Prophet, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, while there was no Prophet among them and that He would command them to act with it in its true and real sense. Hence, if it is not possible that He had sent down the Qur’an upon a people while there is no speaker on its behalf, no expressor on its behalf, nor interpreter of what is obscure of it nor clarifier of its indications, similarly, it is not possible for us to act with it except if there is, along with it, one who takes among us the position of the Prophet, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, in his people and the people of his era with regards to clarifying its abrogator, abrogated, specific and general elements, and the meanings which Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, intended with His Speech, with that which does not possibly contain interpretation, like how the Prophet, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, was a clarifier of all of that to the people of his age. That is a must, as long as they adhere to intellect and religion. If a sayer was to say: That which delivers to us what we need to know of the unclear elements of the Qur’an and of the meanings intended by Allah, with other than that whose terms may not possibly contain of that, is the nation. That which negates this the most is the nation’s dispute and testimony, in consensus, upon itself in many of the verses of the Qur’an to their ignorance of its meaning which Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, intended. In that lies clarification that the nation is not the deliverer on behalf of Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, which clarifies the Qur’an, and that in that it does not take the position of the Prophet, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family. If a daring was to dares and say: Certainly, it would be possible for Him to have sent down the Qur’an on the people of the era of the Prophet, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, while there is no Prophet with them, and that He would command them to act in worship with what is in it, in spite that interpretation is possible in it. It would be said to him: Suppose that this had caused of dispute in its meanings what has occurred in this age, what would they do? If he would say: What they do at this hour. It would be said: What they have done at this hour is for every sect of the nation to take one side of the interpretation and act with it while declaring as aberrant the sect that opposes them in it and testifying against it that it is not on the truth. If he was to say: It is possible for there to have been so during the first stages of Islam, and in that lies wisdom from Allah and justice towards them. He would (in the case of this statement) have performed a major error and which I have not seen any of the creation daring to, and it would be said to him after that: Then tell us, if it was feasible for the fluent Arabs, the people of the language, to interpret the Qur’an and for each one of them to act with what he interprets of the Arabic language, then what will they do, those of the people who do not know the language? And how will they non-Arabs, of the Turks and the Persians, do? And to what thing will they refer back with regards to knowledge of what Allah has obliged upon them in His Book? And from which sect will they accept, with the dispute among sects with regards to interpretation and your declaration of the permissibility for each sect to act in accordance with its interpretation? Hence, it would be a must for you make the non-Arabs and those who do not understand the language follow the path of the people of the language in the sense that they may follow whichever of the sects they wish. Otherwise, if you would bind upon those who do not understand the language to follow some sects and not others, it implies that you place all the truth with that sect and not others. Hence, if you place the truth in, you would have negated what you based your speech upon, and you would need for there to be with that sect a knowledge and proof by that recognize it (as the truth) from others, and that is not of your saying in which you make all sects equal with regards to the truth in spite of the contradiction between their interpretations. It would then be necessary for you to make for the non-Arabs and those who do not understand the language that they follow whichever of the sects they wish. If you do so, it would imply, at this time, that you do not bind upon any of your opponents, from the Shi’a, Khawarij, people of interpretations and everyone who opposes you from those who have a sect and from innovators who do not have a sect, a condemnation. This is a negation of Islam and violation of the consensus, and it will be said to you: Is it not a condemned opinion that Allah commands the creation to act in worship with the content in a Book that is agreed upon, which none is able to read its content, and that He commands them to research and explore, and that each sect acts with what it sees is in the Book? If you had declared this as permissible, you would have declared frivolity as permissible for Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, because that is, indeed, among the characteristics of a frivolous. Also, it implies that you declare as permissible for everyone who ponders upon a thing with his intellect and considers something of religion as good, that he believes in it, because it would be equal; He would have permitted them to act with the foundations of what is allowable and forbidden and its branches by their opinions, or he would permit for them to ponder with their intellects into the roots of religion, all of it, and its branches, from its (tenet of) Monotheism and others, and that they also act with what they consider as good and rely on to be true. If you declare that as permissible, you would have declared it possible for Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, to allow for the creation that they testify for Him that He is the second of two, to believe in existentialism and to knowingly reject the Creator, Glorious and Exalted is He. This is the last there is of this speech, because the one who declares as possible that Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, commands us to act in worship by the Book whilst there being the possibility of interpretation and there not being an informer who is truthful to us about its meanings, implies that he declares as permissible for the people of the era of the Prophet, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, the same as that, and if he declares the same as that as permissible, it implies that Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, allows for every sect to act in accordance to what it believes and interprets, because they would not have other than that if they were not to have any proof with regards to this interpretation being more correct than that interpretation. If He has allowed that for them, (it implies that) He has allowed for their follower who does not know the knowledge, and if He allows for those as well, it implies that He allows for us in this age. If He allows that for us with regards to the Book, it implies that He allows that for us with regards to the foundations of what is allowable and forbidden and analogies of the intellect, and that is an exiting of the Religion, all of it. If it is necessary with what we have previously mentioned with regards to that there must be an interpreter on behalf of the Qur’an and the reports of the Prophet, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, it is necessary that he is Infallible, in order for it to be obligatory to accept from him, and if it is necessary that he is Infallible, it is invalidated that this applies to the nation due to what we have clarified of its dispute in the interpretation of the Qur’an and the reports, its quarreling with regards to that and its declaration of each other to be disbelievers. If that is affirmed, it is necessary for the Infallible to be the one that we mentioned, and that is the Imam. We have proved that the Imam is not but Infallible, and we have shown that if Infallibility is necessary to be in the Imam, there is no escape from that the Prophet, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, to have confirmed his case, because Infallibility is not in the apparent disposition by which it is recognized by the creation through observation. Hence, it is obligatory that it is affirmed by the Knower of unseen things, Blessed and Exalted is He, on the tongue of His Prophet, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, and that is because the Imam is not but affirmed of. The affirmation has been authenticated to us, in accordance to what we have clarified of arguments and what we have narrated of authentic reports."

The one who recites fifty verses, will be written to be among the remembering. The one who recites a hundred verses, will be written to be among the performers of qunut. The one who recites two hundred verses, will be written to be among the devoted. The one who recites three hundred verses, will be written to be among the winners.

Then the Commander of the Believers, peace be upon him, said: The tradition is what was made a tradition by the Messenger of Allah, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family. The innovation is what was invented after him. The community are the people of truth, even if they were a few. The schism are the people of falsehood, even if they were many."

Then he said, after Jibra’eel came to him and informed him: Indeed, the bald (land) is the marshy earth that satisfies neither with liquid nor food, its grazing. The bare (land) is the earth that does not give its blessing, and whose mellow does not come out, and whose expenditure is not known. The worth of earth’s spots are markets, and they are the arena of Iblees in which he appears with his banner, places his chair and spreads his offspring.

We were told by Ali bin Abdullah al-Warraq, that he said: We were told by Sa’d bin Abdullah, from Ibrahim bin Ma’ruf, from Ibrahim bin Mahziyar, from his brother, Ali, from Hasan bin Sa’eed, from Harith bin Muhammed bin Nu’man, the cross-eyed, the companion of al-Taq, from Jameel bin Saleh, from Abu Abdillah al-Sadiq, from his fathers, peace be upon them, that he said: The Messenger of Allah, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, said: The one who would like to be the most generous of the people, let him fear Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He. The one who would like to be the most godfearing of the people, let him trust Allah. The one who would like to be the wealthiest of people, let him be with regards to what is with Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, more confident than with what is in his hand. Then he, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, said: Shall I not inform you of the worst of people? They said: Sure, O Messenger of Allah. He said: The one who hates people and whom people hate. Then he said: Shall I not inform you of worse than this? They said: Sure, O Messenger of Allah. He said: The one who does not dismiss an accidental mistake, nor accepts an apology nor forgives a sin. Then he said: Shall I not inform you of worse than this? They said: Sure, O Messenger of Allah. He said: The one whose evil cannot be guarded from, nor whose good can be expected. Indeed, Isa ibn Maryam, peace be upon him, stood upon among the sons of Isra’eel and said: O sons of Isra’eel, do not speak of the wisdom to the severely ignorants, lest you wrong it, and do not prevent its people, lest you wrong them, and do not assist the oppressor with his oppression, lest your virtue is invalidated. Things are three: a matter whose guidance has been clarified to you, so follow it; a matter whose enticement has been clarified to you, so avoid it; and a matter about whom it is disputed, so leave it for Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He."

Then it was said: It is him. So he sent peace upon him, and then he said: O Commander of the Believers, indeed, I have come to you from the side of the Levant, and I am an old man who have heard about you of virtue what I cannot count, and indeed, I assume that you will be assassinated. Hence, teach me from what Allah has taught you. He said: Yes, O old man, the one whose two days are equal, is defrauded; the one to whom this world is his concern, his heartbrokenness will intensify when it is separated (from him); the one whose tomorrow is the worst of his two days, is prevented; the one who does not care about what will afflict him in his Hereafter once his worldly affairs are safe, is to perish; the one who does not promise to give himself less will be defeated by desire; and the one who is in (a state of) decline, death is best for him. O old man, be pleased for people what you are pleased with for yourself, and give to people what you would like to be given to you. Then he turned towards his companions and said: O people, do you not see the people of this world, that they sleep at night and wake up at morning on various conditions; between one who has collapsed and bends, between one who visits (an ill person) and one who is visited (due to illness), and another who struggles with himself (due to decline), and another who is not sought, and another who is covered (by a cloth after having died), and who demands from this world while death seeks him, and one who is unaware, but is not neglected. In accordance to the past (In this manner) the rest become. Then Zaid bin Sawhan al-‘Abdi said to him: O Commander of the Believers, which (element of) authority is more defeating and strong? He said: Desire. He said: Then what type of debasement is the most debased? He said: Craving for this world. He said: Then what type of poverty is the most intense? He said: Disbelief after faith. He said: Then what type of call is the most misleading? He said: The one who calls for what will not be. He said: Then what act is the best? He said: Godfearness. He said: Then what act is the most successful? He said: Seeking what is with Allah. He said: Then what type of companion is the worst?

He said: Then whom among the people is the smartest? He said: The one who is insightful of his guidance from enticement and inclines to his guidance. He said: Then who is the most forbearing among the people? He said: The one who does not become angry. Then who among the people has the most stable opinion? He said: The one whom people do not seduce from himself, and whom this world does not seduce with its beautification. He said: Then whom among the people is the most stupid? He said: The one who is seduced by this world while he sees what is in it of its change of conditions. He said: Then who among the people is the most intensively heartbroken? He said: The one who was prevented from this world and the Hereafter; that is the clear loss. He said: Then who among the creation is the most blind? He said: The one who acts for other than Allah and seeks with his act reward from Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He. He said: Then what type of the content is the best? He said: The one who is content with what Allah has given him. He said: Then what type of calamity is the most difficult? He said: The calamity with regards to Religion. He said: Then which act is the most beloved to Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He? He said: Awaiting relief. He said: Then who among the people is the best to Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He? He said: The one among them who is most fearful of Allah, the one among them who acts the most with godfearness and the one among them who is the most abstaining in this world. He said: Then what type of speech is the best to Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He? He said: Mentioning him in abundance, invoking to Him and supplicating. He said: Then what saying is the most truthful? He said: The testimony that there is no god but Allah. He said: Then which act is the greatest to Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He? He said: Submission and piety. He said: Then who among the people is the most truthful? He said: The one who is truthful in places of trial. Then he, peace be upon him, approached the old man and said: O old man, indeed, Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, created a creation which He tightened this world upon in favor to them, and so He made them abstinent in it and with regards to its waste material. Hence, they became desiring for the Home of Peace which He called them to, and they became patient for the tight livelihood and became patient for adversity, and they longed for what is with Allah of dignity and spent their lives for the sake of achieving the satisfaction of Allah, and the seal of their acts has become martyrdom. Thus, they met Allah while He was pleased with them, and they knew that death is the path of those who went and who remain, and so, they increased for their Hereafter with other than gold and silver, wore coarse clothing, were patient for humiliation, preferred virtue, loved for the sake of Allah and hated for the sake of Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He. Those are the lamps in this world and the people of bliss in the Hereafter. Peace. Then the old man said: Then to where shall I go and leave Paradise, while I see it and see its people with you, O Commander of the Believers? Prepare me with strength by which I can become strong against your enemy. Then the Commander of the Believers, peace be upon him, gave him a weapon and incited him, and he was in the war between the hands of the Commander of the Believers, peace be upon him, hitting foot by foot, and the Commander of the Believers, peace be upon him, was amazed by what he was doing. When the war intensified, he moved his horse forward until he was killed, may Allah grant him mercy. He was followed by a man from the companions of the Commander of the Believers, peace be upon him, and he found him collapsed, and he found his riding animal, and he found his sword in his arm. When the war ended, the Commander of the Believers, peace be upon him, was brought his riding animal and weapon, and the Commander of the Believers, peace be upon him, prayed upon him, and he said: This is, by Allah, the truly ejoicing, so ask Allah to grant mercy to your brother."

Then Salman, upon whom is Allah’s mercy, said: Me, O Messenger of Allah. Then the Messenger of Allah, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, said: Then which of you revives the night? Salman said: Me, O Messenger of Allah. He said: Then which of you completes the Qur’an every day? Then Salman said: Me, O Messenger of Allah. Then some of his companions were angered, and he said: O Messenger of Allah, indeed, Salman, a man from the Persians, wants to pride over us? You said: «Which you fasts for a lifetime?» and he said: «Me» whereas he eats most of his days. And you said: «Which of you revives the night?» and then he said: «Me» whereas he sleeps most of his night. And you said: «Which of you completes the Qur’an every day?» and then he said: «Me» whereas he is silent most of his time. Then the Messenger of Allah, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, said: Careful, O such-a-person, how can you achieve that of Luqman the Wise? Ask him, for indeed, he will inform you. Then the man said to Salman: O servant of Allah, did you not claim that you fast for a lifetime? He said: Yes. Then he said: I have seen you eating (throughout) most of your day. He said: It is not as you think. I fast the three days a month, and Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, said: «The one who brings a good deed, to him is ten the likes of it.» (6:160). Furthermore, the root of Sha’ban is in the month of Ramadhan. Hence, that is fasting for a lifetime. Then he said: Did you not claim that you revive the night? He said: Yes. Then he said: You sleep most of your night. He said: It is not as you think. However, I have heard my beloved, the Messenger of Allah, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, say: «The one who sleeps upon (being in a state of) purity, it is as if he has revived the night.» Hence, I sleep upon (being in a state of) purity. Then he said: Did you not claim that you complete the Qur’an every day? He said: Yes. He said: But you are silent most of your days. He said: It is not as you think. However, I have heard my beloved, the Messenger of Allah, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, say to Ali, peace be upon him: «O father of Hasan, your example in my nation is like the example of: Say, He is Allah, One and Only. (112:1) Hence, the one who recites it once, has certainly recited a third of the Qur’an, and the one who recites it twice, has certainly recited two thirds of the Qur’an, and the one who recites it three times, has certainly completed the Qur’an. Thus, the one who loves you with his tongue, a third of faith has certainly been fulfilled for him, and the one who loves you with his tongue and heart, two thirds of faith has certainly been fulfilled for him, and the one who loves you with his tongue and heart and who assists you with his hand, faith has been completed for him. By He who sent me with the truth, O Ali, if the people of earth loved you like (the extent of) the love of the people of Heaven to you, none would have been tormented in the Fire.» I recite «Say, He is Allah, One and Only» (112:1) three times every day.

They are inhabited by those from my nation who beautify speech, feed with food, spread peace, continuously fasted and prayed at night while people were asleep. Then Ali, peace be upon him, said: O Messenger of Allah, and who can handle this from your nation? He, peace be upon him, then said: O Ali, do you not know what beautifying speech is? (It is) The one who says, when he wakes up at the morning and is to sleep at night: «Glory be to Allah, and praise be to Allah, and there is no god but Allah, and Allah is the Greater» ten times. Feeding with food is a man’s expenditure towards his family. As for continuously fasting, it is that a man fasts the month of Ramadhan and three days of every month, by which the fasting of a lifetime is written for him (in rewards). As for praying at night while people are asleep, it is that the one who prays (the prayer of) the sundown, the prayer of the last evening and the prayer of the early morning in a mosque in congregation, and it will be as if he has revived all the night (in prayer). The spreading of peace is that one is not stingy with sending peace upon anyone of the Muslims."

We were told by my father, may Allah grant him mercy, that he said: We were told by Sa’d bin Abdullah, from Ahmad bin Abi Abdillah, from his father, in a narration that was ascribed to the Prophet, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, that he said: Jibra’eel, peace be upon him, came to the Prophet, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, and said: O Messenger of Allah, indeed, Allah, Blessed and Exalted is He, sent me to you with a gift which I have not given to anyone before you. The Messenger of Allah, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, said: And what is it? He said: Patience, and better than it. I said: And what is it? He said: Satisfaction, and better than it. I said: And what is it? He said: Abstinence, and better than it. I said: And what is it? He said: Sincerity, and better than it. I said: And what is it? He said: Certainty, and better than it. I said: And what is it, O Jibra’eel? He said: Indeed, the pathway to that is to have trust in Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He. Then I said: And what is it to have trust in Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He? He said: The knowledge (of the fact) that the created does not harm, nor benefit, nor give, nor prevent, and the appliance of despair from the creation. If a servant is as such, he will not act for anyone besides Allah, nor will he seek nor fear other than Allah, nor will he aspire from anyone other than Allah. That is the one who has trust. He said: I said: O Jibra’eel, what is the interpretation of patience? He said: That you are patient during distress like how you are patient during ease, and during destitution like how during wealth, and during tribulation like how during comfort. Hence, he would not complain of his condition to the created due to what afflicts him of tribulation. I said: And what is the interpretation of contentment? He said: That he is content with what he acquires from this world; that he is content with the little and thanks for that of little value. I said: And what is the interpretation of satisfaction? He said: The one who is pleased is not angered at his Master, regardless if he acquires from this world or does not acquire, and he is not pleased for himself with little deeds. I said: O Jibra’eel, and what is the interpretation of abstinence? He said: The abstinent loves the one who loves his Creator, hates the one who hates his Creator, feels discomfort with regards to that which is permissible from this world and does not turn towards its forbidden, for indeed, its permissible is (subject to) reckoning and its forbidden is (a cause for) punishment. Moreover, he is merciful to all Muslims like how he is merciful towards himself, and he feels discomfort from speech like how he feels discomfort from the corpse whose rottenness is intensified, and he feels discomfort from the waste material of this world and its beauties like how he avoids the fire to reach him. Also, (he feels discomfort from) that his deed is shortened, and that a long lifetime is between his eyes. I said: O Jibra’eel, and what is the interpretation of sincerity? He said: The sincere who does not ask the people for anything until he finds, and if he finds he is pleased, and if something remains with him, he gives it for the sake of Allah. Hence, the one who does not ask the created, has certainly declared worship to Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, and if he finds and is pleased then he is pleased with Allah and Allah, Blessed and Exalted is He, is pleased with him, and if he gives for the sake of Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, he is at the edge of confidence in his Lord, Exalted and Glorious is He. I said: And what is the interpretation of certainty? He said: The certain acts for Allah as if he sees Him, and since he does not see Allah, then indeed, Allah sees him. Moreover, it is that he knows certainly that what he has acquired, he was not to miss, and that what he missed, he was not to acquire. This, all of it, are branches of having trust and is a pathway of abstinence."

The food that is made for the arrival (of someone) from travel, is called naqee’a. It is also called wikar. Rikaz refers to profit. It is as if he indicates that making food for the approaching from Mecca includes a profit to its maker of abundant reward, and from this meaning is the saying of the Prophet, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family: «Fasting during winter is the cold profit». The people of Iraq have said: rikaz applies to all metals. The people of Hijaz have said: rikaz refers exclusively to buried property from what has been saved by the sons of Adam before Islam. That is how it was mentioned by Abu Ubaida as well, and there is no saying except by Allah.

Al-Asma’I said: As for the seed, everything to which it vegetates seeds, the name of the one of them is a seed. Al-Farra’ said: A seed is that which is sown from leguminous plants. Abu Ubaid said: There is another interpretation to hameel, and it is more munificent (in meaning) than this. It is said: One is called hameel because one’s lineage is unknown, and it is that a man would say: «This is my brother» or «my father» or «my son», and so he would not be believed except with a proof, because in that case, he seeks to repel the inheritance of his master who set him free.

Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, said: «And test the orphans (in ability) until age of marriage. If you are satisfied with them in (terms of) sound judgement – that is rationality – then give to them their property.» (4:6) It was said: Sound judgement is righteousness in terms of religion and maintenance of property. As for much questioning, he forbade people from asking about their properties, and it may also be included, among questioning, commandments and much search for it, like how He, Exalted and Glorious is He, said: «Do not ask about things which if they were visible to you, they would harm you.» (5:101) As for the burial of girls, they used to bury their daughters alive, and that is why they used to call the grave a «son-in-law». As for his saying that he forbade to speak of «it was said, and what is said». «What is said» refers to an infinitive tense. Do you not see that when he says «it was said, and what is said» it is as if he is said: «it was said, and sayings (of people)». It is said, in this regard: «I said a qawl, qeel and qaal [2]». In accordance to the (Qur’anic) recitation of Abdullah [3]: «That is Isa bin Mariam, the Qaal [4] of Truth» (19:34). Stemming from this, it is as if he said: «The Saying of Truth»."

Raising is to ascend the head and make it in an upright position. Allah, Exalted is He, said: «Racing ahead, their heads raised up» (14:43).

It is said from it: «I have performed tasriya for the water» and it is said: «Water that has been subject to tasriya» in a short manner [2]. It is also said that from this, it was named misrat, as if water had accumulated in it."

He said: It is like that to some disbelievers and dissolute people. Do you not see from them those who observe those hardships? That is what is more severe than this, except (that it is not more severe) than the torment of the Hereafter, for that is more severe than the torment of this world. It was said: Then what is it with us that we see a disbeliever whose death struggle is easy upon him, by which he turns off while telling, laughing and speaking, while among the believers as well there are those who are like that? Also, among the believers and the disbelievers (alike) there are those who endure these hardships during the intoxication of death? He said: That which is of comfort to the believer there (during that stage), is his reward that was rushed to him, and that which is of distress is purification of him from his sins in order that he may reach the Hereafter clean, pure and deserving of the reward of the everlasting that has no obstacle to it. That which is of ease there to the disbeliever, is for him to be granted the reward of his good deeds in this world in order that he may reach the Hereafter while not having but what necessitates punishment upon him, and that which is of distress upon the disbeliever there is the commencement of the punishment of Allah to him after his good deeds have finished.

Ali bin Hussain, peace be upon them both, said: When the matter of Hussain bin Ali bin Abi Talib, peace be upon them both, was intensified, those who were with him looked at him, and at sudden he was behind them, because whenever the matter intensified, their colors changed [1], their shoulder flanks shivered and their hearts fell, whereas Hussain, peace be upon him, and some of those who were with him of his special companions, their colors would shine, their limbs would quieten and their inner selves would calm. They said to each other: Look, he does not care about death! Then Hussain, peace be upon him, said: Patience, O sons of the generous, for death is but a bridge that makes you cross from suffering and harm to the wide gardens and everlasting bliss, for which of you would dislike to relocate from a prison to a castle? For your enemies, it is not but like the one who relocates from a castle to prison and torment. Indeed, my father told me of the Messenger of Allah, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, that this world is the prison of the believer and the paradise of the disbeliever, and that death is the bridge of those to their Gardens and the bridge of those to their Hell.

I said: Yes. Ibn Abbas used to say: The greater pilgrimage is on the Day of Arafah. He meant that the one who catches up with the Day of Arafah until the rise of the dawn from the day of slaughter, has indeed caught up with the pilgrimage, and that the one who misses that has missed the (completion of the) pilgrimage. Hence, he made the night of Arafah (as a standard) to what is before it and to what is after it. The evidence to that is that the one who catches up with the night of (what is before the day of) sacrifice until the rise of dawn, has indeed caught up with the pilgrimage, and it would suffice to him from (the Day of) Arafah. Abu Abdillah, peace be upon him, said: The Commander of the Believers, peace be upon him, said: The greater pilgrimage is the day of slaughter. He argued with the saying of Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He: «So, travel freely in the land for four months» (9:2) and they are twenty from Dhu’l-Hijjah, Muharram, Safar, the month of Rabi’ul-Awwal, and ten from the month of Rabi’ul-Akhir. If the greater pilgrimage was on the Day of Arafah, the (duration of) free travel would have been four months and one day. Moreover, he argued with the saying of Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He: «And (it is) an announcement from Allah and His Messenger to the people on the day of the greater pilgrimage» (9:2), and I was the announcement among the people. Then I said to him: What is the meaning of this phrase: «the greater pilgrimage»?

From this stems the saying of Hasan, peace be upon him: «The prayer of the daytime is ‘ajma.» He is saying: Recitation shall not be heard during it. As for jubar, it is to kill in vain. The wound of a beast was only declared to be vain in the case it is loose, having to leader, nor puller, nor rider. If one of these three was with it, he is a guarantor, because the offense therein would not be (legally made) to the beast, but it would only be an offense to its owner who allowed people to ride it. As for his saying: «a well is a jubar» it has more than one saying. It is said: It refers to a well whose owner hires a man to dig it in his property, and it collapses on the digger. Hence, there is no assurance upon its owner. It is also said: It is a well that is in a man’s ownership, and a human or an animal fall into it. Hence, there is no assurance upon him, because it is in his ownership."

Hence, that is (considered to be) a vain death. It is like a man who is found killed in an open land, by which it is not known for him any killer. Hence, there is no retaliation, nor indemnity for him. As for his saying: « metal is a jubar» they are these metals from which gold and silver are extracted, by which some people would come to dig them up for them for a defined thing [1], and the metal would perhaps collapse on them and kill them. Hence, their blood were shed in vain, because they only worked in return for a reward. As for his saying: «and there shall be one-fifth for rikaz», the people of Iraq and the people of Hijaz have disputed with regards to rikaz. The people of Iraq have said that rikaz refers to metals, all of it, and the people of Hijaz have said that rikaz refers exclusively to buried property among what the sons of Adam have stored before Islam."

Then He made him appear on the Throne, and so, he was by the leg of the Throne, fastened, for seven thousand years until Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, placed him in the backbone of Adam, peace be upon him, and then He transmitted him from the backbone of Adam to the backbone of Nuh, peace be upon him, and then from one backbone to another backbone, until Allah, Exalted is He, took him out of the backbone of Abdullah bin Abdul-Muttalib. Then, He generously dignified him with six miracles: He made him wear the Shirt of Satisfaction; dressed him with the Garment of Prestige; throned him with the Throne of Guidance; made him wear the Trousers of Conscious Knowledge; made his waistband the Waistband of Love, by which he tightens his trousers; made his sandal the Sandal of Fear; and He handed to him the Staff of the Rank. Then he said to him: O Muhammed, go to the people and say to them: Say: «There is no god but Allah, Muhammed is the Messenger of Allah». The making of that shirt was from six things: its figure was of ruby; its sleeves were of pearl; its patch was of yellow crystal; its underarms was of peridot; its collar was of red corals; and its pocket was of the Light of the Lord, Glorified be His Glory. Allah accepted the repentance of Adam, peace be upon him, by that shirt, returned the ring of Sulayman with it, returned Yusuf to Ya’qoub with it, saved Yunus from the belly of the wale with it, and so with the rest of the Prophets, peace be upon them.

We were told by Abu’l-Abbas, Muhammed bin Ibrahim bin Ishaq al-Talaqani, may Allah be pleased with him, that he said: We were told by Abdul-Aziz bin Yahya al-Jaloudi, that he said: We were told by Hisham bin Ali, and Muhammed bin Zakariya al-Jawhari, that they both said: We were told by Ibn Aisha, with a chain of narrators that he mentioned, that Ali, peace be upon him, was informed that groups of horses (carrying mercenaries belonging) to Mu’awiya reached Anbar and killed a governor in it named Hassaan bin Hassaan. Then he went out, angrily, pulling his robe, until he reached Nakhila, and he was followed by the people. He then went up lofty ground, praised Allah, commended Him and sent blessings upon the Prophet, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, and then said: To proceed, striving is, indeed, a gate from the Gates of Paradise, whom Allah opened to the special ones among His Allies, and that is the garment of godfearness, the protective shield of Allah and His secure tool. Hence, the one who abandons it out of willingness (to something else) away from it, Allah will dress him with the garment of humiliation, the trait of degradation and the coward of the minors. I have, certainly, called you to war against these people, at night and day, in secret and public, and I have said to you: Assault them before they assault you, for by He in whose Hand is my inner self, no people have been assaulted within the core of their homes except that they were humiliated. Then, you did not commit, you drooped, and my saying became heavy upon you, and you took it behind your backs (in neglect), until harries were waged against you. Here is the brother of Ghamid; his horses reached Anbar and they killed Hassaan bin Hassaan, and many men from them, and women. By He in whose Hand is my inner self, it has, certainly, reached me that he would enter into a Muslim and allied (non-Muslim) woman and pull off their anklets and earrings, and then they would leave, having abundance, and none of them would be injured with an injury. If a Muslim individual would die from this out of sorrow, he will not be blameworthy according to me, but rather, he would be worthy of it! How strange, all strangeness, is it of these people to cooperate on their falsehood, and of your failure from (assisting) your truth! If I was to tell you: «Assault them during the winter» you would say: «This is a time of coolness and severe cold», and if I was to tell you: «Assault them during the summer» you would say: «This is (a time of) the severe heat of the summer, so wait for us that the heat might finish from us»! Thus, if you were to flee from heat and cold, then you are, by Allah, more worthy of fleeing from the sword! O you who resemble men, and you are not men, and O masses of boys during puberty, and O you with intellects like those who raise partridges, by Allah, you have, verily, distorted (the reputation of) my ability with your disobedience, and you have, verily, filled my inside with rage, to the extent that Quraish said: «Indeed, the son of Abu Talib is brave, but he has no ability in war». To Allah, how strange are they! And who there is more knowledgeable of it and more intense capability to it than me? For by Allah, I, verily, stood up in it whilst not having reached (the age of) twenty, and today I have become more than sixty. However, there is no opinion (to be executed) for the one who is not obeyed. He said it [1] thrice. Then a man stood up to him, and with him was his brother, and he said: O Commander of the Believers, me and this brother of mine are like what Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, said, speaking of Musa: «My Lord, indeed, I do not have other than myself and my brother» (5:25). Hence, command us with your commandment, for by Allah, we shall, verily, adhere to it, even if there was between us and between it (burning) coal of saxaul and thorns of tragacanth. Then he prayed for him for goodness, and then he said: And where are you placed from what I want? Then he, peace be upon him, went down."

The Arabs, during the Jahiliya, used to say, when one star of them falls and another star appears: «It must be that there comes wind and rain along with that» and so they would ascribe every rain therein to that star that falls therein, and they would say: «Our rain is due to the movement towards the west of Thuraiya, Dabran, Samak» and whatever would be of these stars. Based on this, that is anwaa’ [1], and one is a naw’. It was only named naw’ because if a faller of them falls during sundown, that which appears in the east at sunrise comes up. It appears in an appearance , and that emergence is naw’, and so the star was named with it. So it is with everything that emerges and moves in slowness, it performs naw’ at its emergence.

We were told by Abu’l-Hasan, Ali bin Abdullah bin Ahmad al-Aswari, that he said: We were told by Abu Yusuf, Ahmad bin Muhammed bin Qais al-Sajzi al-Mudhakkar, that he said: We were told by Abu’l-Hasan, Amru bin Hafs, that he said: I was told by Abu Muhammed, Ubaidullah bin Muhammed bin Asad, in Baghdad, that he said: We were told by Hussain bin Ibrahim, Abu Ali, that he said: We were told by Yahya bin Sa’eed al-Basri, that he said: We were told by Ibn Jareeh, from ‘Ataa’, from ‘Ubaid bin ‘Umayr al-Laithi, from Abu Dharr, may Allah grant him mercy, that he said: I entered into the place of Allah’s Messenger, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, while he was in the mosque, sitting alone, so I took profit from his solitude. He then said to me: O Abu Dharr, indeed, there is a salutation to the mosque. Then I said: And what is its salutation? He said: Two rak’a’s that you perform. He then turned to me, and I said: O Messenger of Allah, you have, indeed, ordered me to pray, so what is the prayer? He said: The best of places, hence, the one who wants may do less, and the one who wants may do more. He said: I said: Which of acts is the most beloved to Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He? He said: Faith in Allah and striving for His sake. I said: Then which of the believers has the most complete faith? He said: Those of them with the best mannerisms. I said: And which of the believers are the best? He said: The one whom Muslims are at safety from his tongue and hand. I said: And which part of the night is the best? He said: The core of the bygone night. I said: And which prayer is the best? He said: The prolonged qunut. I said: And which charity is the best? He said: (To spend) Effort from one destitute to a poor in secret. I said: And what is fasting? He said: A rewarding obligation, and with Allah are many multiples (of it). I said: And which of the necks (in captivity) is the best? He said: That which is of most expensive price, and which is most valuable to its people. I said: And what striving is the best? He said: The one in which one’s horse is slaughtered and one’s blood is shed. Then I said: And which verse whom Allah sent down upon you is the greatest? He said: The verse of the Chair. Then he said: O Abu Dharr, the Heavens are not, as compared to the Chair, except like a small ring thrown into an open land, and the preference of the Throne over the Chair is like preference of the open land over that small ring. I said: O Messenger of Allah, how many are the Prophets? He said: A hundred and twenty-four thousand Prophets. I said: How many are the Messengers among them? He said: Three hundred and thirteen, a numerous abundance. I said: Who was the first of the Prophets? He said: Adam. I said: And was he, from among the Prophets, a Messenger? He said: Yes, Allah created him with His Hand and blew into him from His Spirit. Then he said: O Abu Dharr, four of the Prophets were Syriac: Adam, Sheeth , Akhnoukh , that is Idrees, peace be upon him, and he was the first to write with the pen, and Nuh . And they were four from the Arabs: Hud, Saleh, Shu’ayb and your Prophet, Muhammed. The first Prophet from the sons of Isra’eel was Musa , and the last of them was Isa , and six hundred Prophets. I said: O Messenger of Allah, how many Books did Allah, Exalted is He, send down? He said: A hundred and four books. Allah, Exalted is He, sent down fifty Journals unto Sheeth, peace be upon him, and thirty Journals upon Idrees, and twenty Journals upon Ibrahim, and He sent down the Tawrat , Injeel , Zabour and the Criterion [1]. I said: O Messenger of Allah, and what were the Journals of Ibrahim? He said: They were proverbs, all of them: «O possession that is trialed and lured, indeed, I have not sent you that you might gather this world, some of it above another. However, I have sent you in order that you might respond, on behalf of Me, to the prayer of the oppressed, for indeed, I will not reject it, even if it may be from a disbeliever. Moreover, it is upon the rational, unless his sense of sanity is subjugated, that he has (made for himself) certain hours: an hour in which he confidentially talks to his Lord, Exalted and Glorious is He; an hour in which he puts himself in reckoning; an hour in which he thinks of what Allah, Exalted is He, has done; and an hour in which he secludes himself to (gain) a portion of his right from what is permissible, and indeed, this hour is an assistance to those hours and a relaxation to the hearts and an unloading of them. Moreover, it is upon the rational to be insightful in his age, moving forward upon his matter, preserving to his tongue, for indeed, the one who calculates his speech from his act, his speech will lessen, except for that which concerns him. Moreover, it is upon the rational that he seeks three: a means of amends for livelihood; a means of increasement for the revival; and pleasure in other than what is forbidden.» I said: O Messenger of Allah, and what were the Journals of Musa? He said: They were lessons, all of them: «I am amazed at the one who is certain of death, how can he rejoice? And of the one who is certain of the Fire, why does he smile? And the one who sees this world and its change with its people, why does he seek confidence to it? And the one who is certain of destiny, why does he strive excessively? And of the one who is certain of the Reckoning, why does he not act?» I said: O Messenger of Allah, is there in our hands from what Allah, Exalted is He, has sent down unto you, of that which was in the Journals of Ibrahim and Musa? He said: O Abu Dharr, recite: «Certainly, he has succeeded, the one who gives the alms tax, and mentions the Name of his Lord and prays. Rather, you are preferring the life of this world, whereas the Hereafter is better and more remaining? Indeed, this is, verily, in the first Journals, the Journals of Ibrahim and Musa.» (87:14-19) I said: O Messenger of Allah, bequeath to me. He said: I bequeath you to (establish) fear of Allah, for indeed, it is the head of the matter, all of it. I said: Increase me. He said: It is upon you to recite the Qur’an and to mention Allah in abundance, for indeed, it is (a cause to) mentioning of you in Heaven and a light for you on earth. I said: Increase me.

He said: And what lead you to what I see? He said: Love for this world and worship of the tyrant. He said: And to what did your love for this world reach? He said: Like the love of a child to his mother; when she approaches, he rejoices, and when she goes away, he grieves. He said: And to what did your worship of the tyrant reach? They said: When they would command us, we obeyed them. He said: Then how were you able to respond me from among them? He said: Because they are stoned with stones of fire, and upon them are Angels that are rough and harsh. I was, indeed, among them, but I was not from them, and so, when the torment afflicted them, it afflicted me with them. Hence, I am adhering to a hair on the edge of Hell, fearing that I fall upside down into the Fire.

That is due to him being parallel in that regard to Abdullah bin Sa’d bin Abi Sarh, and they both used to write the Revelation to him, and he was the one to said: «I will reveal like what Allah has revealed». Moreover, the Prophet, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, used to dictate for him: «And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful in particular», whereas he would write: «And Allah is Mighty, All-Wise», and he would dictate for him: «And Allah is Mighty, All-Wise», whereas he would write: «And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise». The Prophet, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, would then say: «It is one, it is one», to which Abdullah bin Sa’d would say: «Indeed, Muhammed does not know what he is saying! He is saying (something), and I am saying other than what he says, and so he says to me: It is one, it is one! If this was permitted, then I will reveal like what Allah has revealed.» Allah, Blessed and Exalted is He, then revealed for his sake: «And the one who said: I will reveal like what Allah has revealed» (6:93). He then fled and recited lampoonery against the Prophet, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, and so the Prophet, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, said: «The one who finds Abdullah bin Sa’d bin Abi Sarh, even if he may be adhering to the veils of the Ka’ba, let him kill him.» The Prophet, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, only used to tell him, with regards to what he was altering: «It is one, it is one» because it was not supposed to be written that which Abdullah wanted, but it should only be written what he, peace be upon him, dictated, and so he said: «It is one, regardless if you alter or do not alter. It shall not be written what you write, but rather, it should be written what I am dictating of the Revelation, and Jibra’eel, peace be upon him, will rectify it. In that lies a denotation to the Prophet, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, and the aspect of the wisdom with regards to that the Prophet, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, assigned Mu’awiya and Abdullah bin Sa’d, while they were enemies, is that the polytheists said: «Indeed, Muhammed is saying that this Qur’an comes automatically, and he comes in every event with a verse which he claims has been revealed unto him.» This is due to that the method of the one who causes speech for events that occur at specific times, is that he alters the phrases if that speech was to be brought again, and he would not bring it at the second matter and after the specific times had passed it, except that he change it from its first case, by phrase and meaning, and by phrases without (causing change to the) meaning. Thus, he sought assistance in writing that which was sent down unto him with regards to occurring events, from two that were hostile to him in (matters of) religion, and (who were considered to be) just according to his enemies. This was in order for the disbelievers and polytheists to know that his speech at the second matter is (like) his speech at the first matter, not having been subject to alteration, nor having turned from its direction. Hence, it would be more serving to deliver the proof upon them. Had he sought assistance to that from two allies, such as Salman, Abu Dharr and their likes, the matter to his enemies would not have fallen into this spot, and it would be (a factor for it to be) imagined as collaboration and agreeability. This is the aspect of the wisdom behind the request for them to write. It is obvious and clear, and praise be to Allah."

We were told by Ahmad bin Isa al-Mukattib, that he said: We were told by Ahmad bin Muhammed al-Warraq, that he said: I was told by Bishr bin Sa’eed bin Qeelawayh al-Mu’addil, in Murafiqa [1], that he said: We were told by Abdul-Jabbar bin Kathir al-Tamimi al-Yamani, that he said: I heard Muhammed bin Harb al-Hilali, a commander in Medina, say: I asked Ja’far bin Muhammed, peace be upon them both, and said to him: O son of Allah’s Messenger, there is a matter (of question) in me which I want to ask you about. He saud: If you wish, I would inform you of your matter before you ask me, and if you wish, then ask. He said: Then I said to him: O son of Allah’s Messenger, and by what thing do you know what is in my inner self before I ask of it? He said: By discerning and scrutinizing. Have you not heard the saying of Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He: «Indeed, in that are signs for those who discern.» (15:75) and the saying of the Messenger of Allah, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family: «Fear the scrutinizing of the believer, for indeed, he gazes with the Light of Allah, Exalted and Gloriousis He»? He said: I said to him: O son of Allah’s Messenger, then inform me of my matter. He said: He said: You wanted to ask me about the Messenger of Allah, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, why he was capable of carrying Ali, peace be upon him, when he put down the statues from the roof of the Ka’ba, despite his strength, severeness and what appeared from him at the pulling out of the gate of the lion in Khaybar and the casting of it behind him by (the length of) forty upper arms, when forty men were not capable of carrying it. The Messenger of Allah, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, however, used to ride a female camel, horse, mole and donkey, and also rode the Buraq [2] at the Night of Ascension, and all that are (signs of what is) beneath Ali, peace be upon him, in strength and severeness. He said: Then I said to him: About this, by Allah, I wanted to ask you, O son of Allah’s Messenger, so inform me. He said: Indeed, Ali, peace be upon him, was honored through the Messenger of Allah, and by him he was elevated, and by him he reached (the extent of) extinguishing the fire of polytheism and invalidating every worshipped except for Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He. If the Prophet, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, had been carried to take down the statues, he would have, through Ali, peace be upon him, become in a state of elevation, honor and reach to take down the statues. If it was as such, he would be better than him. Do you not see that Ali, peace be upon him, said: «When I was on the back of Allah’s Messenger, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, I was honored and raised to the extent that even if I had wished to reach the sky, I would have reached it»? Do you not know that the lamp is that by which one is guided in darkness, and in which the branch emerges from the source? Ali, peace be upon him, had said: «I am from Ahmad [3] like (how) a light (is derived) from light.» Do you not know that Muhammed and Ali, Allah’s blessings be upon them both, were between the Hands of Allah, Glorified be His Glory, before the creation of the creation by two thousand years, and that when the Angels saw that Light, they saw that it had a source from which a brightening radiation diverged, and it said: «Our God and Master, what is this Light?» to which Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, revealed to them: «This is a Light from My Light; its source is Prophethood and its branch is Imamate. As for the Prophethood, it is for Muhammed, My Servant and Messenger, and as for the Imamate, it is for Ali, My Proof and Viceregent, and were it not for both of them, I would not have created My creation»? Do you not know that the Messenger of Allah, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, raised the hands of Ali, peace be upon him, in Ghadeer Khumm until the people saw the whiteness of their underarms, and made him the Master of the Muslims and their Imam, and that he, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, had carried Hasan and Hussain, peace be upon them both, on the day of the yard of the sons of Najjar, and that when some of his companions said to him: «Hand me one of them, O Messenger of Allah» he said: « How good are the two who are carrying, and how good are the two will ride, and their father is better than»? [4] It was narrated in another report that the Messenger of Allah, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, carried Hasan and that Jibra’eel carried Hussain, and that it was for this sake that he said: «How good are the two who are carrying». He, peace be upon him, was praying (in congregation) with his companions and had prolonged one prostration of his prostrations, and that when he sent peace, it was said to him: O Messenger of Allah, you certainly prolonged this prostration. He, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, then said: Yes, indeed, my son rode on me, and I disliked to make him haste until he gets down. By that, he, peace be upon him, only wanted to elevate and honor them. The Prophet, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, is the Messenger of the sons of Adam, whereas Ali, peace be upon him, is an Imam, and is not a Prophet, nor a Messenger, and so, he is not capable of carrying the weights of Prophethood. [5] Muhammed bin Harb al-Hilali said: Then I said to him: Increase me, O son of Allah’s Messenger. He said: You are surely deserving of more. Indeed, the Messenger of Allah, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, carried Ali on his back in the manner that he intended that he is the father of his children and the Imam of the Imams from his backbone, like how he transformed his garment during the prayer of seeking rain and wanted to give his companions a notice that the barren ground had turned into fertile. He said: Then I said to him: Increase me, O son of Allah’s Messenger. He said: The Messenger of Allah, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, carried Ali and wanted to give notice to his people that he is the one who will lighten from the back of Allah’s Messenger, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, that which is upon him of debt, numbers and clearance on his behalf after him. He said: Then I said to him: O son of Allah’s Messenger, increase me. He said: Indeed, he carried him in order to give notice by it that he had carried him along with what he has carried, because he is an Infallible and does not carry a (sinful) burden, and hence, his acts would be a wisdom and rightness to people. Moreover, the Prophet, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, said to Ali, peace be upon him: O Ali, indeed, Allah, Blessed and Exalted is He, made me carry the sins of your party [6] and then forgave me for them. That is the saying of Him, Exalted and Glorious is He: «That Allah might forgive what has preceded, of your (act of) sin, and what will follow» (48:2). Moreover, when Allah, Blessed and Exalted is He, sent down unto him: «O you who have believed, it is upon you (to take care of) your own selves» (5:105) the Prophet, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, said: «O people, it is upon you (to take care of) your own selves. You will not be harmed by the one who aberrates if you are guided. Ali is my own self and my brother. Obey Ali, for indeed, he is purified, Infallible, he will not aberrate, nor become wretched.» He then recited this verse: «Say: Obey Allah, and obey the Messenger, and if they turn away, it is only upon him what was carried upon him, and it is upon you what was carried upon you, and if you obey him, you will be guided. And there is not upon the Messenger except for the clear notification.» (24:54) Muhammed bin Harb al-Hilali said: Then Ja’far bin Muhammed, peace be upon them both, said: O commander, if I was to inform you of what lies in the carrying of the Prophet, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, to Ali, peace be upon him, during the taking down of the statues from the roof of the Ka’ba of the meanings which he intended with it, you would surely had said: «Indeed, Ja’far bin Muhammed is surely insane.» Hence, it is sufficient for you of that what you have heard. Then I stood up to him, kissed his head and said: Allah is More Knowledgeable where He places His Message."

We were told by Ahmad bin Ahmad bin Yahya al-Mukattab, that he said: We were told by Abu’l-Teeb, Ahmad bin Muhammed al-Warraq, that he said: We were told by Ali bin Harun al-Himyari, that he said: We were told by Ali bin Muhammed bin Sulayman al-Nawfali, that he said: I was told by my father, from Ali bin Yaqteen, that he said: I said to Abu’l-Hasan, Musa bin Ja’far, peace be upon them both: Is it permissible for a Prophet of Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, to be stingy? He said: No. Then I said: Then what is the indication of the saying of Sulayman, peace be upon him: «My Lord, forgive me and grant me a kingdom that shall not be for anyone after me» (38:35)? And what is its meaning? He said: A kingdom is (of) two (types of) kingdoms: one kingdom that is taken by victory, tyranny and election by the people; and one kingdom that is taken (by being granted) from Allah, Blessed and Exalted is He, such as the kingdom of the Family of Ibrahim and the kingdom of Talut and the One with Two Horns. Sulayman, peace be upon him, said: «Grant me a kingdom, one by which it shall not be, for anyone after me, to say that it is taken with victory, tyranny and election by the people.» Hence, Allah, Blessed and Exalted is He, subjected the wind to him by which it flows, by his command, gently where he approaches, and he made its going be for one month and its coming be for another month. Moreover, he subjected the devils to him, every labouring and diving, and he was taught the speech of birds, and he was given the ability (to all) on earth. Then, people during his time, and after it, knew that his kingdom does not resemble the kingdom of kings that are chosen by the people and those who became kings through victory and tyranny. He said: I said to him: And the saying of Allah’s Messenger, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family: «May Allah grant mercy to my brother, Sulayman, how stingy he was»? He said: His sayings has two (possible) indications: one of them is how stingy he was with regards to his honor and bad statement about himself; and the other indication says: «How stingy he was, if it was that he intended what the ignorant ones think.» He, peace be upon him, then said: Surely, we have, by Allah, been granted what Sulayman was granted and what Sulayman was not granted, and what none from all the worlds was given. Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, said with regards to the story of Sulayman: «This is Our grant, so grant or withhold without account.» (38:39) He said with regards to the story of Muhammed, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family: «Whatever the Messenger brings you, take it, and what he forbade you, refrain.» (59:7) [1]"

We were told by Ahmad bin Hasan al-Qattan, that he said: We were told by Abdul-Rahman bin Muhammed al-Hussaini, that he said: We were told by Abu’l-Teeb, Muhammed bin Hussain bin Hameed al-Lakhmi, that he said: We were told by Abu Abdillah, Muhammed bin Zakariya, that he said: We were told by Muhammed bin Abdul-Rahman al-Muhallabi, that he said: We were told by Abdullah bin Muhammed bin Sulayman, from his father, from Abdullah bin Hasan, from his mother, Fatima bint Hussain, peace be upon them both, that he said: When the illness of Fatima, the daughter of Allah’s Messenger, Allah’s blessings be upon her, was severed, the women of the Muhajirun and the Ansar gathered at her place, and they said to her: O daughter of Allah’s Messenger, how have you become this morning from your illness? She said: I have become at this morning, by Allah, one who will leave this world of yours and detests your men; I spat them before I chewed them, and I have become to disgust them after having examined them. Hence, ugliness (be to them) due to the roundedness of the edges (of swords), weakness of the spears and clumsiness of opinions. Moreover, evil is what their own selves presented for them, that (it caused) Allah (to) became angry at them, and that they are to abide in torment. Assuredly, I had certainly bound the nooses to them and poured its shame upon them. Hence, may mutilation, slaughter and crushing afflict the oppressive people. Woe to them, how did they remove it from the Mountains of the Message, the Foundations of Prophethood, the descension spot of the Trusted Revelation and the Knowledgeable of matters of materialism and Religion. Alas, that is the clear loss! Whatever they harbored of malice towards Abu Hasan, they harbored, and Allah will be, for his sake, in disavowal with His Sword. Severe shall His touch be, and by exemplary punishment shall His affliction be, due to his rage for the sake of Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He. By Allah, if they had refrained from the ropes cast by Allah’s Messenger, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, he would have taken it, and he would have walked with them in a suggestible manner by which its khashash will not cause injury, nor will its rider shake, and he would have made them approach a good, high-flowing spring whose banks are full to the brim, and he would have sent them off while they are full. He chose for them irrigation without seeking lawfulness to it with an enormous thing, except by a tumbler of water and the repelling of the evil of the famished. Moreover, the blessings of the Heaven and the earth would have opened to them. Allah will take them for what they acquired. Alas, come and hear. When you live (to see), life will show you wonder, and if you are wondered by the occurring, to what buttress did they lea non, and to what rope did they adhere? They replaced, by Allah, that which is behind the tail for that which is before it, and the bottoms for the upper back. Hence, there shall be spite against the sneezers for the disobediences of a people who assume that they are doing good. Alas, they are, indeed, the causers of corruption, however, they do not sense. «Is the one who guides to the truth more worthy of being followed, or the one who does not guide except that he is guided?» (10:35) Hence, what is it with you, how do you judge? Verily, by the religion of your God, I have become upset. Thus, wait a little, while you are producing, then, (you may) seek to milk until the fullness of the large vessel, from tender blood and pungent venom. There, the falsifiers will lose, and the followers will know the outcome of what the first established. So, be pleasant for yourselves, and be confident for agitation due to tribulation, and hear the tidings of a cutting sword, an inclusive turmoil and despotism from the oppressors; it will leave your booty small in size and your crops to be harvested. How heartbreaking will that be for you! And how can assistance be sought from you, when you have been blinded? Shall we bind you to it while you are disliking it?"

I saw my inheritance being plundered, and until the first one went his way, he assembled it to the brother of ‘Adi after him. How strange is it that he was attempting to cast it off, during his lifetime, and then the other assembled it after his demise. He then placed it, by Allah, in a tough enclosure, whose touch was rough, whose cause of injury was harsh, and whose mistakes were plenty and so the excuses to them. Thus, the one who possessed it was like the rider of an unruly camel; if he would deal with it fiercely, he stops, and if he would deal with it loosely, he falls into darkness. Consequently, the people got afflicted by unsteadiness, deviation and tribulation along with such-a-belittled and such-a-belittled. So, I remained patient for the long period and severe ordeal until he went his way, and he made it among a group which he claimed I am one of. But by Allah, what is there to do with them and the congregation? Since when did doubt arise about me along with (their following of) the first of them, to the extent that I was made akin to these likes? A man of them then inclined his desire (to another) and another listened to his son-in-law. Then the third (leader) from the people arose, heaving his chest, between his penis and fodder spot, and the sons of Umayyah arose with him, chewing on the property of Allah like the chewing of camels for the spring’s vegetation, until his own deed delivered him the deathblow. I was then not surprised except by that people came to me like the mane of the hyena. They advanced to me from every side, to the extent Hasan and Hussain were stepped upon and the edge of my shoulder garment was torn. When I then arose with the matter, one group violated (their oath), another gravely disobeyed and others became renegades, as if they had not heard the saying of Allah, Blessed and Exalted is He: «That Home of the Hereafter, We make for those who do not seek elevation on earth, nor corruption. And the good outcome is for the godfearing.» (28:83) Sure, by Allah, they had certainly heard it. However, this world appeared as glittering in their eyes, and its ornament seduced them. By the One who split the seed and creation mankind, were it not for the attendance of the assistant, the establishment of the Proof and what Allah, Exalted is He, has taken upon the scholars that they do not acknowledge the gluttony of the oppressor, nor the famine of the oppressed, I would surely have cast its rope on its own shoulders, and I would have made its end drink by the cup of its beginning (by equal treatment). You would then have observed that this world of yours is of less value to me than the nose-fart of a goat. He said: A man from the mass handed him a book, and so he interrupted his speech and received the book. I then said: O Commander of the Believers, (it would be good) if you were to continue your saying until you are finished. He said: May such stay far, O Ibn Abbas. That is (like) a foam of a camel that gushed out, but then subsided. I have never grieved over any speech like my grievance over the speech of the Commander of the Believers, Allah’s blessings be upon him, as he did not reach what he intended."

Verily, Nuh went out of this world and he had made his people swear an oath to fulfill to his Successor, Sam, and his nation did not fulfill it him. Verily, Ibrahim went out of this world and he had made his people swear an oath to fulfill to his Successor, Isma’eel , and his nation did not fulfill it him. Verily, Musa went out of this world and he had made his people swear an oath to fulfill to his Successor, Jusha’ bin Nun [2], and his nation did not fulfill it him. Verily, Isa was raised to Heaven and he had made his people swear an oath to fulfill to his Successor, Sham’un bin Hamoun al-Safa [2], and his nation did not fulfill it him. And indeed, I am to depart from you soon, and I am to leave from before your appearance, and I have, verily, made my nation swear an oath to fulfill with regards to Ali bin Abi Talib. Indeed, it is the one that will ride the traditions of those before it of nations, with regards to opposing my Successor and disobeying him. Alas, I am, indeed, renewing upon you my oath (by which you are bound) with regards to Ali. Thus, the one who violates, he only violates on the account of himself, and the one who fulfills to what he has sworn an oath to Allah for, He will grant him a great reward. O people, indeed, Ali is your Leader after me, my Successor upon you, and he is my Bequeathed, Minister, brother, assistant, husband of my daughter, the father of my sons and the possessor of my salvation, basin and banner. The one who denies him has certainly denied me, and the one who denies me has certainly denied Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, and the one who acknowledges his Imamate has certainly acknowledged my Prophethood, and the one who acknowledges my Prophethood has certainly acknowledged the Oneness of Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He. O people, the one who disobeys Ali has certainly disobeyed me, and the one who disobeys me has certainly disobeyed Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, and the one who obeys Ali has certainly obeyed me, and the one who obeys me has certainly obeyed Allah. O people, the one who rejects Ali with regards to speech or action has certainly rejected me, and the one who rejects me has certainly rejected Allah above His Throne. O people, the one amongst you who chooses above Ali a leader has certainly chosen above me a prophet, and the one who has chosen above me a prophet has certainly chosen above Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, a lord. O people, indeed, Ali is the Master of the Successors, the Leader of the Radiant and Beautiful and the Master of the Believers.

My father, may Allah grant him mercy, said: We were told by Sa’d bin Abdullah, from Ahmad bin Muhammed bin Isa, from Mufaddal ibn Umar, that he said: I said to Abu Abdillah, peace be upon him: Indeed, those before us say: Indeed, if Allah, Blessed and Exalted is He, loves a servant, a caller from Heaven will call his name: «Indeed, Allah loves such-a-person, so love him», and so, love for him shall be cast in the hearts of the servants, and that if Allah, Exalted is He, hates a servant, a caller from Heaven will call his name: «Indeed, Allah hates such-a-person, so hate him». He said: Will Allah cast hatred towards him into the hearts of the servants? He said: He, peace be upon him, was leaning, so he sat upright and dust off himself three times, saying: Not, it is not like they are saying. However, if Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, loves a servant, He would seduce the people on earth that they speak (bad) of him, and so, He will declare them as sinful and reward him, and if Allah hates a servant, He makes him beloved to people that they speak (good) of him, and so, He will declare them and him as sinful. He, peace be upon him, then said: Who was more beloved to Allah than Yahya bin Zakariya [1], peace be upon him? Yet, He seduced them with regards to him until they killed him. And who was more beloved to Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, than Ali bin Abi Talib, peace be upon him? Yet, he faced from people what you know.

We were told by Ahmad bin Hasan al-Qattan, that he said: We were told by Hasan bin Ali al-Sukkari, that he said: We were told by Muhammed bin Zakariya al-Jawhari, that he said: We were told by Ja’far bin Muhammed bin ‘Umara, from his father, from Sufyan ibn Sa’eed, that he said: I heard Abu Abdillah, Ja’far bin Muhammed al-Sadiq, peace be upon them both, and he was, by Allah, Truthful , like how he was named, saying: O Sufyan, it is upon you to perform Taqiya, for indeed, it is the tradition of Ibrahim, the Close Friend, peace be upon him. Indeed, Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, said to Musa and Harun: «Go, both of you, to Pharao, for indeed, he has tyrannized, and say to him a tender saying, that he might remember or fear.» (20:43-44) Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, is saying: Call to him by his nickname and say to him: «O father of Mus’ab». Indeed, when the Messenger of Allah, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, wanted to travel, he took cover with another person, and he said: My Lord has ordered me to use conformity with people like how He has ordered me to perform the obligatory acts. Certainly, Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, disciplined him with Taqiya and said: «Repel with that which is better. Thereupon, the one whom between you and him there is enmity, it is as if he is a devoted friend. However, none is granted it except those who ere patient, and none is granted it except one with a great portion (of goodness).» (41:34-35) O Sufyan, the one who uses Taqiya with regards to the Religion of Allah has certainly attained the highest top of honor. Indeed, the honor of the believer is in the preservation of his tongue, and the one who does not have control of his tongue, will regret. Sufyan said: Then I said to him: O son of Allah’s Messenger, is it possible that Allah makes, Exalted and Glorious is He, makes His servants seek to cause that which will not be? He said: No. I said: Then how did Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, say to Musa and Harun, peace be upon them both: «that he might remember or fear» (20:44) while He knew that Pharao will not remember, nor fear? He said: Indeed, Pharao did remember and fear, however, (it was) during when he saw the suffering, (at the moment) when faith does not benefit him. Do you not hear Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, say: «when drowning overtook him, he said: I have believed that there is no god except for the One whom the sons of Isra’eel believed in, and I am of the Muslims» (10:90) to which Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, did not accept his faith and said: «Now? And you had disobeyed before, and you were among the causers of corruption. Hence, today We will save you by your body that you might be, for those after you, a sign» (10:91-92)? He is saying: We will cast you on a peak of the earth that you might be for those after you a sign and a lesson. We were told by Abu’l-Abbas, Muhammed bin Ibrahim bin Ishaq al-Talaqani, may Allah be pleased with him, that he said: We were told by Abu Bakr, Muhammed bin Qasem al-Anbari, that he said: We were told by Abu’l-Abbas, from Ahmad bin Yahya, from Salama, from al-Farra’, that he said: It is said: It is called a dhirwa of a mountain and its dhurwa [1], and it is said Fir’awn and Fur’awn [2], and it is said Sufyan and Sifyan. Abu Bakr said to me: And Yunus, the grammarian, said that it is Sufyan. It has been narrated of other than al-Farra’ that Sufyan is possible to have been derived from safan, that are the scales of a fish that are glued on swords. It is also possible that it is derived from: «The wind scattered [3] the wind, in a manner of scattering [4]» in a shortened form. Safaa’, as in the extended form, is ignorance."

And who is the Ally of Allah, Exalted and Glorious is He, that I may befriend him? And who is His enemy that I may antagonize him? The Messenger of Allah, Allah’s blessings be upon him and his Family, then pointed for him towards Ali, peace be upon him, and said: Do you see him? He said: Sure.
