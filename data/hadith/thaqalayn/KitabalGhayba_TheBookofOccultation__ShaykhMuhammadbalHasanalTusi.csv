That is those, who are deniers of the favors and blessings of God; and did not include us among those about whom the Holy Quran says: “The Shaitan has gained mastery over them, so he has made them forget the remembrance of Allah; they are the Shaitan’s party; now surely the Shaitan’s supporters are the losers.” (58:19) And blessings of the Almighty Allah be on the Chief of Prophets, the last chosen servant of God, His Eminence, Muhammad Mustafa (s) and his pure and chaste progeny, whose members are shining stars and lofty standards of guidance; to whose guardianship and rope of guidance we are attached and through following whom we anticipate success in the hereafter. So to say: Our senior and respected teacher [apparently he implies to Shaykh Mufeed], may the Almighty Allah grant him a long life, ordered me to compile a book on the topic of occultation of the Master of the Age, which would explain the cause of occultation of the Imam and the reason of its prolongation and his remaining away from people, whereas they are in dire need of the Holy Imam and strife and mischief is spreading in the world at a very fast rate. Why the Imam is not reappearing and what are the hurdles in his reappearance? What is the benefit of his existence? So that in this regard, all questions raised by opponents, enemies and doubters, should be replied. In spite of shortage of time, mental tensions and unfavorable circumstances and difficulties, I agreed to comply with this suggestion and obeyed his orders. Therefore, here I would mention points, through which all doubts may be removed, although I wouldn’t prolong the discourse, because this topic is studied and explained in detail in my other books as well as those of my teachers. So, in this book, I would reply to the different questions raised in various fashions and mention some traditional reports to support our statements and views so that those who are attached to traditional reports and are aware of the outward meanings should be satisfied, since definitely the intricate points of this subject are unknown to many and sometimes they don’t have the capacity to understand these complicated matters. Thus, I have adopted a particular way, which shall be useful to both kinds of people. In this regard, I beseech the Almighty for divine opportunity (Taufeeq) and help and He is a sufficient guardian for me."

Likewise, taking into consideration that all those for whom infallibility is claimed, and are said to be invisible and hidden, such as the supposed hidden leaders of Kaisaniyya, Nawusiyya, Fatihiyya, Waqifiyya and others sects, their claims are invalid, thus the Imamate of the son of Imam Hasan Askari and his occultation and mastership (Wilayah) is proved, no other dispute is there in the Ummah. Hence, there is no need to take the burden of proving his birth and to explain the reasons of his occultation as the word of truth and true belief is present in the Ummah and not outside it."

Our adversary either submits to us in the question of his Imamate and inquires about the reason of his occultation, obliging us to answer him or he does not submit to us, in which case, to inquire about the reason of occultation of someone, whose Imamate is not proved, will be meaningless. If disputed about his Imamate, we prove it as follows: The necessity of Imamate in every condition and age as long as Divine obligations and duties fall on the shoulders of the fallible human beings is proved through strong proofs. It is likewise proved that one of the conditions of the Imam is to be certain of his infallibility. At the same time, it is clear that truth is exclusive to this Ummah. With these premises proved, we find that the Ummah is divided into sects that follow different beliefs. One group says that there is no Imam. The premise asserting the necessity of Imam in every age and condition invalidates this statement."

Observation testifies contrary to the contention of others, who maintain the infallibility of their supposed Imams; because their actions are apparent and their conditions violate infallibility, hence there is no need to disprove a belief, the contrary of which is so very evident and clear. Persons for whom infallibility was claimed and certain groups followed them, such as the Kaisaniyya, who believe in the Imamate of Muhammad Ibne Hanafiyyah, the Nawusiyya, who believe in the Imamate of Ja’far Ibne Muhammad and also believe that he is not dead, and the Waqifa, who believe that Musa Ibne Ja’far is not dead – all these beliefs are invalid for reasons we will shortly mention."

Likewise, the three principles – necessity of an Imam, necessity of certainty of his infallibility, and that truth is with this Ummah – as we mentioned, must be established for this argument to stand. We will elaborate on each of these premises briefly, since their details exist in our book on Imamate to an extent that can hardly be expanded further, whereas the purpose of this book is only to explain the topic of occultation and no more.

For example: knowing that God exists, a principle, which no duty-bound (Mukallaf) can be without. Don’t you see that it is evident that when a fallible group of people are without an awe-inspiring and venerable leader, who would stop the enemy, reprimand the criminal, seize the hand of the counterfeiter, and defend the weakling against the strong, mischief occurs, deceptions spread, debauchery increases and propriety becomes a rarity? And when they have a leader with these qualities, the situation is reversed, with integrity expanding and encompassing and mischief becoming uncommon and rare? This is very obvious and anyone with common sense would agree to it­ rendering anyone who disputes it unworthy of conversation.

They will be required to prove that occultation does not involve any evil aspect, because if evil is involved, occultation becomes evil, though it may carry a good aspect, just as we say in imposing a duty that is beyond one’s capacity, involves an evil aspect, though it may involve a good aspect by being a Lutf (grace) for others."

This principle cannot be violated during occultation, since we would be away from evil during it if we were with a leader, who has these qualities. This is the proof of the necessity of such divinely-ordained leadership. However, the existence of a leader as such is not proved during occultation, nor is it proved that it is unjust to have religious obligations when he is not present. Thus it invalidates the proof."

However, this cannot be achieved with him being in hiding and therefore, his existence and non-existence have no difference. As his hidden existence does not correspond to his necessary existence you have argued for, your argument does not lead to the necessity of his existence during occultation. Therefore, though your argument indicates your point when he exists in the condition of administering the society, it does not prove an Imam, who is not running the affairs of the society, and in occultation the control of Imam on the society is also not proved."

He should have explained “the evil aspect”, which he wanted to prove to the Imamiyah, so it would have been possible for us to consider it and reply to it. He has not done that and therefore his argument is inconclusive. If he asks, “Do you reject that occultation involves a wrong aspect?” Our response would be that wrong aspects are conceivable in the context of oppression, vanity, lie, debauchery and ignorance, and none of these are involved here. This leads us to reject the instance of any wrong aspect."

Therefore, this is an evil that they have caused themselves.

We do not say that he did not understand what he said, for he is better than that; however, he desired to misguide and disguise lunacy in lucidity, by saying, “The argument for necessity of leadership stands violated by occultation, since if the fact that an awe-inspiring Imam, who is in charge of affairs keeps people away from wrong, renders his presence a necessary grace in all ages and religious obligations without him unjust, this would be violated during occultation and conferment of obligation would not be wrong in his absence.

Our answer with respect to the occultation of the Imam is the same as their answer to the incapacity of “those having a say” with respect to choosing a suitable candidate for Imamate.

The fact that we know that the appointment of the Imam is necessary in all conditions indicates the falsity of their assertion. Besides, either way the logic of this reasoning encourages that when the infidel does not attain belief in Allah, He will do him a grace that takes the place of belief in Him, which leads to the conclusion that belief in Allah is not always necessary.

Even if we agree to the example he mentions, his argument is not valid, because if Allah, the Exalted, has ordained us to draw out water now, it is necessary that the rope should be existent right now, because that is what eliminates excuse. However, if He says: If you approach the well, I will create a rope for you, obligation is to approach, not to draw out water. Therefore, the ability to approach is what is sufficient at that time, because one is not required to draw out water from the well, yet. It is when he approaches the well that he becomes ordained to draw out water, and then it is necessary that He creates the rope for him. An analogous instance to this would be that if it were not obligatory on us in every condition to obey the Imam and empower him, in such times, his existence would not have been necessary."

They need him since they are fallible. This leads us to conclude that the reason for the need of an Imam is people’s fallibility. Like we say about the reason for need of an effect to its cause is its occurrence (huduth), due to the fact that an entity having huduth needs a cause, and an entity that does not have huduth, never needs a cause. So we conclude that every effect needs a cause. Similarly, the need of every fallible to an Imam must be acknowledged, or the rule of causality will be violated. Now, if the Imam is himself fallible, he would also be needful of an infallible Imam. The same argument applies to his Imam, leading to the conclusion of an infinite number of Imams or to an infallible Imam, which is our purpose. We have established this argument in our books, therefore, we will not prolong the inquiry by raising further questions and answering them, as the purpose of this book is different from other books and this much suffices."

Since the proof of the validity of consensus of the Ummah in our belief is the fact that no age can remain without an infallible Imam, who cannot possibly do a wrong, based on our proofs, therefore, truth does not leave this Ummah for the infallible entity is amongst us; and according to our opponent, on the virtue of the arguments they mention, it is concluded that consensus is a binding proof. Therefore, there is no need to occupy ourselves with proving this principle. Having established these principles, the Imamate of the Master of the Age is proved; because everyone who believes that the Imam must be infallible is certain that he is the Imam. There is no one who believes in the Imam’s infallibility and questions his Imamate, except parties whose creed is demonstrated through irrefutable proofs, such as Kaisaniyya, Nawusiyya and Waqifa. When we disprove their claims, the Imamate of our Master is automatically proved."

One is that Amirul Momineen granted him the standard on the battle of the Camel in Basra, and his saying, “You are truly my son,” while Hasan and Husain were also his sons.

There was a dispute between Muhammad bin Hanafiya and Imam Zainul Abideen over Imamate. Muhammad claimed that after the martyrdom of Imam Husain , the Imamate has been entrusted to him. Imam Sajjad also argued with him on the basis of the verse: “…and the possessors of relationships are nearer to each other…” (8:75) Interpretation of this verse is in favor of Imamate of Imam Sajjad and his descendants. Then Imam Sajjad said: I argue with you through Hajar Aswad [and leave the judgment to it]. Muhammad bin Hanafiyyah asked: How can you argue with me through a stone, which can neither hear nor reply? Imam reminded him that Hajar Aswad can adjudge between them; so they agreed on going to the Kaaba to decide (the matter) by the Black Stone. Imam Zainul Abideen said to Muhammad Hanafiyyah: Go ahead and speak to Hajar Aswad. Muhammad came forward and stood besides Hajar Aswad and spoke to it, then he fell silent, but Hajar Aswad did not reply. Then Ali bin Husain came forward and placed his hand on Hajar Aswad and then supplicated: “O Allah, I ask You by Your name written on the canvas of glory.” The Imam supplicated and said: “O Allah, make this stone speak.” Then he addressed Hajar Aswad: “I call you in the name of one who has reposed the covenants of people in you and made you the testimony of those who come to you, I adjure you to inform to whom Imamate and successorship of the Messenger of Allah (s) belongs?”"

Reply: This assertion leads to the impossibility of discerning the consensus of the Ummah on any principle or idea, as it is always convenient to say that perchance there is someone in some remote periphery of the earth who disagrees with this. It follows that there might be someone in faraway parts of the earth, who says that eating hailstones does not violate a fast and that it is permissible for a fasting person to eat until sunrise; for the first was the view of Abu Talha Ansari and the second that of Huzaifah and Amash.

على البصرة حينئذ فمضى به، فحبسه عنده سنة. ثم كتب إلى الرشيد أن خذه مني وسلمه إلى من شئت وإلا خليت سبيله، فقد اجتهدت بأن أجد عليه حجة، فما أقدر على ذلك حتى أني لاتسمع عليه إذا دعا لعله يدعو علي أو عليك، فما أسمعه يدعو إلا لنفسه يسأل الرحمة والمغفرة. فوجه من تسلمه منه، وحبسه عند الفضل بن الربيع ببغداد فبقي عنده مدة طويلة وأراد الرشيد على شيء من أمره فأبى. فكتب بتسليمه إلى الفضل بن يحيى فتسلمه منه وأراد ذلك منه فلم يفعل. وبلغه أنه عنده في رفاهية وهو حينئذ بالرقة. فأنفذ مسرور الخادم إلى بغداد على البريد، وأمره أن يدخل من فوره إلى موسى بن جعفر عليه السلام فيعرف خبره، فإن كان الامر على ما بلغه أوصل كتابا منه إلى العباس بن محمد وأمره بامتثاله، وأوصل كتابا منه آخر إلى السندي بن شاهك يأمره بطاعة العباس. فقدم مسرور فنزل دار الفضل بن يحيى لا يدري أحد ما يريد، ثم دخل على موسى بن جعفر عليه السلام فوجده على ما بلغ الرشيد، فمضى من فوره إلى العباس بن محمد والسندي، فأوصل الكتابين إليهما. فلم يلبث الناس أن خرج الرسول يركض إلى الفضل بن يحيى، فركب معه وخرج مشدوهاً دهشاً، حتى دخل (على) العباس، فدعا بسياط وعقابين. فوجه ذلك إلى السندي، وأمر بالفضل فجرد ثم ضربه مائة سوط، وخرج متغير اللون خلاف ما دخل، فاذهبت نخوته، فجعل يسلم على الناس يمينا وشمالا. وكتب مسرور بالخبر إلى الرشيد، فأمر بتسليم موسى عليه السلام إلى السندي بن شاهك وجلس مجلسا حافلا، وقال: أيها الناس إن الفضل بن يحيى قد عصاني وخالف طاعتي ورأيت أن ألعنه فالعنوه. فلعنه الناس من كل ناحية حتى ارتج البيت والدار بلعنه. وبلغ يحيى بن خالد فركب إلى الرشيد، ودخل من غير الباب الذي يدخل الناس منه حتى جاء‌ه من خلفه وهو لا يشعر، ثم قال له: التفت إلي يا أمير المؤمنين. فأصغى إليه فزعا فقال له: إن الفضل حدث، وأنا أكفيك ما تريد. فانطلق وجهه وسر، وأقبل على الناس فقال: إن الفضل كان عصاني في شيء فلعنته، وقد تاب وأناب إلى طاعتي فتولوه. فقالوا له:نحن أولياء من واليت وأعداء من عاديت وقد توليناه. ثم خرج يحيى بن خالد بنفسه على البريد حتى أتى بغداد، فماج الناس وأرجفوا بكل شيء. فأظهر أنه ورد لتعديل السواد والنظر في أمر العمال، وتشاغل ببعض ذلك ودعا السندي فأمره فيه بأمره، فامتثله. وسأل موسى عليه السلام السندي عند وفاته أن يحضره مولى له ينزل عند دار العباس بن محمد في أصحاب القصب ليغسله، ففعل ذلك. قال: سألته أن يأذن لي أن أكفنه فأبى وقال: إنا أهل بيت مهور نسائنا وحج صرورتنا وأكفان موتانا من طهرة أموالنا، وعندي كفني. فلما مات أدخل عليه الفقهاء ووجوه أهل بغداد وفيهم: الهيثم بن عدي وغيره، فنظروا إليه لا أثر به، وشهدوا على ذلك، وأخرج فوضع على الجسر ببغداد ونودي: هذا موسى بن جعفر قد مات فانظروا إليه. فجعل الناس يتفرسون في وجهه وهو ميت. قال: وحدثني رجل من بعض الطالبيين أنه نودي عليه: هذا موسى بن جعفر الذي تزعم الرافضة أنه لا يموت فانظروا إليه. فنظروا إليه. قالوا: وحمل فدفن في مقابر قريش، فوقع قبره إلى جانب رجل من النوفليين يقال له عيسى بن عبد الله.","H 6 - Ahmad bin Abdun has narrated the statement of Abul Faraj Ali bin Husain Isfahani that he said: Ahmad bin Ubaid Allah bin Ammar reported on the authority of Ali bin Muhammad Nawfali on the authority of his father; and Ahmad bin Muhammad bin Saad (reported); and Abu Muhammad Hasan bin Muhammad bin Yahya on the authority of their teachers, who said: The reason for the arrest of Musa bin Ja’far was that Harun Rashid had put his son in the care of Ja’far bin Muhammad bin Ashath and Yahya bin Khalid Barmaki was jealous of that. He said (to himself): “If the caliphate passes on to (the son), my dominion and that of my son will be destroyed.” Therefore he deceived Ja’far bin Muhammad - and the latter used to believe in Imamate - so that he managed to gain access to him and establish friendly relations with him. His visits to his house were frequent and he became acquainted with his affairs, which he reported back to H¡r£n Rashid and he added to these reports that which would make (Harun Rashid) feel hatred towards him. One day (Yahya bin Khalid) asked some of those he trusted: “Would you find for me a member of the family of Abu Talib, who is not in comfortable circumstances, and then he would let me know what I need?” He was directed to Ali bin Ismail bin Ja’far bin Muhammad. Yahya bin Khalid took him some money. Musa was friendly with Ali bin Ismail bin Ja’far bin Muhammad, used to bring him gifts and treat him well. Yahya bin Khalid sent to (Ali bin Ismail) requesting him to visit Harun Rashid and drawing his attention to the kind treatment, which he had given him. So he decided to do that. Musa was concerned and summoned Ali. “Where are you going, cousin?” he asked. “Baghdad,” was the reply. “Why are you doing that?” he enquired. “I am in debt and I am poor,” he answered. “I will pay your debt and act for you and carry out (what you need),” Musa told him. He did not pay attention to that and began to set about (preparing for his) departure. Abul Hasan asked him to come and said to him: “Are you leaving?” “Yes,” he replied, “I must do that.” “Look, cousin,” he said to him, “fear God and do not give away any confidences against my children.” He ordered him to be given three hundred dinars and four thousand dirhams. (When he stood up in front of him) Abul Hasan Musa spoke to those who were present: “By God, he will strive against my blood and will confide against my children.” “May God make us your ransom,” they said, “did you know this from his state when you were giving him gifts and being generous to him?” “Yes,” he said, “my father told me on the authority of his ancestors, on the authority of the Messenger of Allah (s) that when kin cut themselves away, then they should be brought back, for if they cut themselves away, God will cut them off. I wanted to bring him back after he had cut himself off from me for if he cuts me off, God will cut him off. Ali bin Ismail set out until he reached Yahya bin Khalid. He gave him news of Musa bin Ja’far and (Yahya bin Khalid) reported to Harun Rashid and added additional material to it. Then he took him to Harun Rashid. The latter asked him about his uncle and he gave information against him to (Harun Rashid). He told him that money was being brought to him from east and west and that he had bought an estate named Al-Yasir for thirty thousand dinars. Its (former) owner had said when he had brought him the money: “I will not accept this currency. I will only accept such-and-such currency.” Then he ordered that money be brought and gave thirty thousand dinars of the currency whose coinage he had asked for. Harun Rashid listened to that and then ordered him to be given two hundred thousand dirhams, with which he sought to make a living in one of the areas. He chose one of the provinces of the east. His messengers were sent to bring the money and he waited there for its arrival. One day he went to the toilet when he was suffering from dysentery and as a result of it the whole of his stomach came out. He fell down. They tried to put it back, but they could not. He was aware of his situation when the money was brought to him while he was in the pangs of death. He said: “What can I do with it? I am about to die.” That year Harun Rashid went on the pilgrimage. He began it at Medina and there he had Abul Hasan Musa arrested. It is reported that when he came to Medina, Musa received him with a group of nobles. They had gone out to meet him and then Abul Hasan had gone on to the mosque as was his custom. Harun Rashid waited until night and then went to the tomb of the Messenger of Allah (s). He said: “O Messenger of Allah (s), I apologize to you for something I want to do. I want to imprison Musa Ibn Ja’far, because he intends to divide your community and cause bloodshed.” Then he ordered him to be taken from the mosque and brought before him. He had him put in chains and called for two awnings to be brought. He had (Abul Hasan) put in one of them on a mule and had the other awning put on another mule. The two mules left his house carrying the two awnings, which were closed. With each one went the cavalry. The cavalry divided and some went with one awning on road to Basra and the other to Kufa. Harun Rashid only did that in order to confuse the people about what had happened to Abul Hasan . He ordered the men who were with the awning in which was Abul Hasan to hand him over to Isa bin Ja’far bin Mansur, who was governor of Basra at that time. He was handed over to him and he kept him in detention for a year. He then wrote a letter to Harun saying, “You may take him (i.e. Imam Kadhim) from me and hand him over to any other person; otherwise, I will release him. I have tried all means to find any overwhelming evidence against him, but I failed. In fact, I even eavesdropped on him hoping that I would hear him invoking God’s curse upon me or you, but I always heard him supplicating God for himself and imploring Him for mercy and forgiveness. So, Harun order someone to go and receive the Imam from Isa. The Imam was then detained with al-Fadhl ibn al-Rabi in Baghdad where he spent a very long time of detention. However, Harun wanted al-Fadhl to kill the Imam, but the later refused. As a result, Harun ordered him through a letter to give the Imam to al-Fadhl ibn Yahya who also refused to obey Harun's orders of killing the Imam. Harun, while residing in al-Riqqah, was then informed that the Imam was living in luxury under the custody of al-Fadhl ibn Yahya; so, he ordered his servant Masrur to go to Baghdad, immediately come to Musa ibn Jaffar and gather information about his actual situation there. Harun instructed, “If you see him enjoy luxury as has been told, you mus then take this letter of mine to Abbas ibn Muhammad and take this another letter to Sindi ibn Shahak and order both of them to carry out my instruction mentioned in these letters immediately.” Obeying his master, Masrur came to Baghdad and resided in the house of al-Fadhl ibn Yahya without letting anyone know what he had come for. He then visited Musa ibn Jaffar and found him enjoying luxury, as exactly as Harun had been told. As soon as he left, he headed for Abbas and Sindi and delivered them the two letters of Harun. At once, the messenger left for al-Fadhl ibn Yahya running. When he was there, the people noticed that al-Fadhl rode with the messenger while he was overcome by astonishment and surprise. Once he met Abbas, he asked for lashes and a lashing wood. He assigned the mission to Sindi and ordered that al-Fadhl should be stripped of his clothes and lashed one hundred lashes. When he left, al-Fadhl was extremely astounded that he unconsciously went on greeting people. Masrur the servant transmitted this news to Harun in a letter and the latter ordered him to had over Imam Musa Kadhim to Sindi ibn Shahak. Harun gathered the people and delivered a speech, saying, “O people, al-Fadhl ibn Yahya has disobeyed and challenged my orders. So, I see that you should invoke curse on him.” Cries of curse on al-Fadhl were uttered by all people from every corner of Harun's house that shook with these cries. Upon receiving these news, Yahya ibn Khalid came to Harun and entered from another door than the one usually used by people. He thus surprised Harun from his back and said to him, “Would you please listen to me, O Amir al-Mu'minin?” Panicked by this move, Harun paid his attention to Yahya who said to him, “It is true that al-Fadhl has committed a mistake, but we can set aright what he has ruined.” These words gladdened Harun who thus turned his face towards the attendants and said to them, “Because al-Fadhl had disobeyed me, I asked you to invoke curse upon him. Now that he repented and returned to my obedience, you should now accept him as your chief.” Acceding to him, the attendants shouted, “We always are friends of those whom you befriends and enemies of those whom you alienate. So, we are now loyalists to al-Fadhl.” Yahya ibn Khalid himself undertook the mission of transferring the ruler’s letters. When he arrived in Baghdad, the people surged and began to doubt everything. So, Yahya had to pretend that he had come for setting aright all their affairs and observing the performance of the governmental officials. While he was implementing some of these reformations, he summoned Sindi and conveyed to him the instructions of the ruler. Of course, Sindi went on carrying out these instructions. At the hour of his death, Imam Musa asked Sindi to bring to him one of his servants who lived in the house of Abbas ibn Muhammad so that he would perform the ritual bathing of his body after his death. Sindi did. The reporter added: I asked Imam Kadhim to allow me to enshroud him, but he refused and said, “We, the Ahl al-Bayt, manage the affairs of the dowries of our wives, our journeys to the Hajj pilgrimage and the shrouds that are used for enshrouding our dead bodies from our purest legally gotten money. I have my own shroud.” When the Imam passed away, master scholars and celebrated personalities of Baghdad, one of whom was al-Haytham ibn Adi, were allowed to see his dead body so that they would witness that he was not killed; rather, his death was natural. His dead body was then taken out and put on the bridge. A caller shouted, “This is the body of Musa ibn Jaffar. You people may come and look at it.” So, the people came to look at his face fixedly. The Reporter added: A man from the descendants of Ali ibn Abi Talib reported to me that the caller who stood on the dead body of Imam Kadhim shouted, “This is Musa ibn Jaffar whom the Rafidah claim that he would not die. Come on and look at him.” So, people came and gazed at the body. The Imam’s body was then carried and buried in the cemetery of Quraysh; so, his grave was next to a man from the Nawfar family, whose name was Isa ibn Abdullah.”"

Has anything happened to him? That is because people claim that a detested thing has been done to him. They say that many times. This is his house and this is his bed. We entertained him and did not harass him. The Commander of the faithful (Harun) does not intend to do evil to him; he is waiting for him to debate with him. He is entertained in all his affairs. So ask him.’” That Shaykh said: “We had no concern, except that we intended to see and meet the Imam. When we approached him, we did not see the like of him in virtue and worship. He said to us: ‘As for the entertainment and the like he mentioned, they are other than what he mentioned. However, people, I will tell you: I have been given poison in seven fresh dates. I will turn yellow tomorrow and die after tomorrow.’” When Sandi heard that, his strength collapsed, and he shook all over. That is because the Imam refuted his claims of being innocent of assassinating him. On the basis of this, the martyrdom of the Imam is so well known that it does not need the mention of traditional reports; because denial of the martyrdom of the Imam in the meaning of opposing the necessities and facts, and on one side doubt in his martyrdom leads to doubt in the death and martyrdom of each of his Infallible forefathers and even others, Therefore, one will not be certain of the death of any of them. In addition to what has passed, it is well known that the Imam made a bequest to his son, Ali bin Musa and after the martyrdom, entrusted the matter of Imamate to him and there are more traditional reports on this subject than they can be computed; we mention some of them to show that if he had been alive, there would have been no need for him to make a bequest to Imam Ali Ridha ."

These traditional reports are present in their books and even in books of your scholars. So, how can you reconcile these two types of traditional reports? And with attention to these traditional reports, how can you claim that he is dead? We would reply: We mentioned these traditional reports by way of information and announcement and not to prove his death from them. It is so, because there exists knowledge of his martyrdom (it is a definite matter) and there is no doubt in it. Like the knowledge of martyrdom of his respected ancestors and one who has doubt in the martyrdom of Imam Musa Kadhim , he can also doubt the martyrdom of his respected ancestors and it is possible to doubt the death of anyone whose information of death we have. We have mentioned these traditional reports only to emphasize the information, because a large number of reports create this knowledge for us through evidence, Shariah, apparent aspect of Quran, consensus and other reasonings. Thus, I mentioned them in this chapter only for emphasis. As for that, which the Waqifiya have narrated: (Firstly) All of them are solitary reports and no evidence and reasoning strengthens them; and it is impossible to claim that they are authentic. (Secondly) In addition, their narrators have also been targets of ridicule and they were unreliable and it is not possible to trust their statements and reports. (Thirdly) With all these explanations all their reports can be interpreted and justified in other ways.

When I reached there, Abul Hasan Ridha sent someone and asked me for the striped cloth from Yemen. It was among the merchandise that I was having, but I had forgotten it, so I said: I don’t have any striped cloth. The Imam’s messenger went away, but returned again to inform me that I was having it in so and so bundle; I found it at the same place and sent it to the Imam. After that I wrote some questions, which I wanted to ask him.

The slave girl recited the following dirge: 1- Being quenched with the land of Tus and one from the progeny of the Prophet who is located there, who has left grief and sorrow for us. 2- I mean Abul Hasan, who is the hope of all. He has right on all who express their grief and sorrow. Muhammad bin Abdullah says: Mamun wept so much that I also started crying. After that he said: Woe be on you, Muhammad, do the people of my house and people of your house consider that it is my duty to appoint Abul Hasan as heir apparent? By Allah, if he had not died, I would definitely have appointed him as my successor [whereas it was Mamun himself who got the Imam martyred], but he passed away so soon. May Allah curse the two sons of Hasan; Abdullah and Hamza, who killed him. Then he said: O Muhammad bin Abdullah, by Allah, I am quoting a strange tradition for you. Keep it confidential. I said: Chief of believers, what tradition is that? He replied: When Zahiriya became pregnant with my son, Badr, I went to Imam Ridha and said: May I be your ransom, I have received information that Musa bin Ja’far, Ja’far bin Muhammad, Muhammad bin Ali, Ali bin Husain and Husain bin Ali used to resort to divination and did not make any mistake in it. You are their successor and their knowledge has come to you and I am also too much fond of Zahiriya and don’t prefer any of my slave girls to her. She has had many miscarriages. Do you have any solution for this? Imam Ridha said: Do not fear miscarriage. Very soon Zahiriya would give birth to a healthy child that would resemble its mother the most and the Almighty Allah has added two things in his creation and it is that it will have an extra finger in both its hands and feet. I said to myself: By Allah, this is a good opportunity that if the circumstances proved against his prediction, I will remove him from heir apparency. Therefore, I was eager for this delivery till Zahiriya got labor pains. I said to the nurse: After the delivery, bring the newborn to me, whether it is a boy or a girl. [After sometime] The nurse brought to me a newborn child with the same characteristics and the boy was glowing like the moon. [Seeing this] I decided that I would leave Caliphate and all the matters of governance to him, but he did not accept. I gave my seal ring to him and said: Please take the matters of governance in your control and you have precedence [in Caliphate] and I will not oppose you at all. By Allah, if he had accepted, I would have done that."

It is not possible to claim that someone, who is not known to have an offspring, does not have an offspring. Such claims are made through likelihoods and conjectures and circumstances indicating that if he had an offspring, it would have been known and its news would have spread. However, many times, prudence dictates that men of wisdom and letters hide their offspring for various considerations. Many kings hide their offspring for fear and for compassion for their progeny. This is observed often in the practice of Persian emperors and kings of antiquity and their stories are famous. People sire sons from their concubines or from their wives they have married secretly, so they reject and ignore their progeny, fearing enmity with their other wives and children. It is also not uncommon amongst people. Some people marry a woman of low social prominence and class, while being from upper echelons and when they father a son from her, they consider it a challenge to their distinction to attribute it to himself; so they deny their relationship altogether, and some of them pity and offer that child some of their wealth. Sometimes a man of a low rank marries a woman of a noble family, because of her infatuation and without the knowledge of her family, either because her guardian does not exist, as many jurists allow; or the ruler has taken over her affairs and marries her to him. When a son is born from him, though the boy is healthy, she disowns him, because of her pride or because of fear of her guardians or elders. Many other reasons are conceivable, which we will not mention to avoid lengthening the discourse. Therefore, it is not possible to negate fatherhood altogether. We can know that only when all the aspects are immaculate and it is known that there is no encumbrance from declaring fatherhood - only then the negation of fatherhood can be known. Our knowledge that the Messenger of Allah (s) did not have a son, who outlived him is due to our knowledge of his infallibility and his Prophethood, and that if he had a son, he would have made it known, because there was no fear in making it public. Moreover, we know through consensus of Ummah that he did not have a son, who lived after him. The same cannot be claimed with respect to the offspring of Hasan , because Hasan was interdicted and was practically a prisoner. There was much worry, concern and fear for the offspring, as it had been a known and famed article of Shia faith that the Twelfth Imam was going to establish the Order for termination of regimes; therefore, it was necessary to keep his birth confidential. So Imam Hasan Askari concealed him even from his family members, like Ja’far Kazzab, his brother, who was eyeing his inheritance and wealth with greed. Thus, he hid his son and doubts with respect to his birth were caused. It is not warranted to analogize the negation of having a son to the subject of knowing the death of a person, because when someone dies, the deceased is seen and known, and his death is known through the circumstances and other evidences that compel anyone who sees them into conviction and when he informs someone who has not seen the deceased personally, he would be compelled to conviction as well. The parallel analogy of the two situations is like the edict of the jurists that witnesses can only testify to prove rights, not to negate them, because negation is not subject to observation, unless it is based on an affirmation. Therefore, the difference of the two situations is clear."

However, not everyone witnesses the death of another man, just as not everyone witnesses the birth of a child. The best a man may know about the death of another person whom he has not seen die is to be his neighbor, to know of his malady, visit him during his sickness, then learn of his worsening condition, and then hear wailing from his house, while there has been no other sick person there. Then he sees the family of the sick neighbor sit in mourning and observes marks of grief and loss on their faces. Then his inheritance is distributed and a long time passes while no reason can be thought of that his family would proclaim his death while he is alive. The same is true with respect to birth, since women witness pregnancy and talk about it. Especially, if she is the honor of a nobleman, people will discuss the condition of such a person. If he courts a concubine, his visits to her will not remain a secret; and when the child is born, people of the house will exude gaiety and jubilation. People will congratulate them if the family is prominent and news will spread; and according to the prominence of the family, people will know that such and such has sired a baby, especially when it is known that there is no objective in expressing that a baby has been born to him or not. So when we consider this, the ordinary behavior is same in both cases; and if Allah should desire to supercede the ordinary behavior, He can do it in either of the two. It is possible that He may disallow through certain encumbrances, the pregnant woman to be seen and her delivery not to be attended, but by a few who are as trustworthy as themselves in safeguarding their secret. It is equally possible that a man should become sick and visitors visit him and when his malady worsens, his death is expected and hope is lost in his life, Allah transfers him to a mountain top and places in his stead a dead person who looks like him. Then through encumbrances He disallows him to be viewed, except by trusted individuals. Then the corpse is buried and his funeral is attended by all those who expected his death and had lost hope in his life, all thinking that the one, who is buried is the one who was sick. Many a time, it is possible that a man’s pulse and breathing ceases, and then Allah breaks the ordinary norms and takes him away from the people, while he is alive, because a living individual needs pulse and breathing in order to exhale burning gases from around the heart through inhaling cool clean air, to cleanse the heart. It is possible that Allah creates coolness in the air surrounding the heart so it may act instead of the cool air that enters through respiration and it is possible that He arranges that none of it may burn, for the heat that is produced therein is killed by that coolness."

We will discuss this objection on the grounds it has been articulated and will say that the way mentioned for knowing someone’s death is not always correct, because sometimes all these elements combine, but the lie is revealed, because the person who displayed all this had a smart objective. He pretended to be sick and goes to his family displaying all that to test those who profess obedience and loyalty to him. Cases similar to this have happened many times in the lives of kings and philosophers. Sometimes people consider heart attack to be death; then the mistake is revealed. This is also evident in public behavior. Death is only known through observation of cessation of sensation and suspension of pulse that lasts for a very long time. Many other signs, known through experience, can be included, which someone who has experience with the sick and has treated them knows."

The suggestion that Allah may take away a person and bring another who looks like him in his place is not at all correct, since this shuts the doorway of reasoning and leads to doubts in observations and that all that we see today is not which we saw yesterday, raising doubts about the death of all the deceased and advancing the belief of extremists (Ghulat) and downgraders (Mufawwidha) who denied that Amirul Momineen and Imam Husain were killed. A line of reasoning that leads to such absurdity has to be specious. The assertion that Allah causes coldness in the body around the heart, which acts instead of air, is a mere wishful effort of pretending to know medicine. It encourages doubts with respect to the death of all who are dead, as we mentioned. Besides, as per medical principles, the motion of the pulse and veins originates from the heart, and fades only with the fading of natural heat. When the pulse ceases, the fading of natural heat is inferred and thus, death of the subject. This is not dependent on inhaling. Therefore, physicians examine the pulse when respiration stops or it is weak. Therefore, his argument and analogy to the birth of a child is shown to be refutable. His claim that births of children become well-known is correct only within the supposition he mentions; that the birth be at the house of a nobleman, who has proclaimed expectation of the birth of the child and there is no reason he should hide it. However, if we suppose that for certain reasons, which we mentioned, the nobleman hides the matter and keeps it a secret, it is not necessary that the birth will be known at all, let alone be well-known. Besides, the Shariah allows birth to be proved through the testimony of a midwife and a verdict is issued on the basis of her testimony, whether she is dead or alive. When this is allowed, on what basis the testimony of multitudes who have narrated the birth of the Master of the Age and have met reliable men who met that sacred entity is rejected? And we will bring the narrations from those who have met him. The opponent has expressed indirectly that it is possible that a reason may rise, requiring expediency that when the child is born, Allah transfers him to a mountain top or another place, where he can remain unknown and where no one finds out about him. Although since he applies the same analogy to death also, we have already explained the distinction between the two occasions."

One of these reasons is their extinction. There is no one left today who believes in these doctrines anymore; and if they had been correct, they would not have perished. Another reason is that Muhammad Ibn Ali Askari died during the lifetime of his father. His death was well-known and traditions regarding it are evident and famous.

One is not incompatible with conferment of religious duties as it does not compel the subject to forsake the wrong. The other kind of protection leads to such compulsion.

All such measures are compatible with conferment of obligations.

However, the Imam is not like him, because as far as the delivery of religious laws is concerned, the public does not have any excuse and all rules they need are indicated by their proofs and it is possible for them to learn them without needing Imam’s words. If we suppose that religious duties cannot be known, except through the words of the Imam, then it will be necessary that God Almighty should protect him and manifest him in such a way that no harm can reach him, as in the case of the Messenger . The like of the case of the Imam is that once a prophet has delivered the message and then his security is threatened, it is not necessary for God to protect him, because the excuse of the public has been removed through his delivery and they have a path to discern the grace imposed upon them. However, it is possible that there might be another message that must be delivered in the future, which may require God to protect him as He protected him in the beginning.

Most religious rules and a considerable portion of the Quran descended in Medina. So how did you claim that it was after the delivery? If the matter was as hinted that the delivery was complete before the prophetic occultation, the completion of delivery does not fulfill the need of his administration and leadership, his orders and prohibitions, for no one can say that after delivery of religious laws, no one needs the Prophet’s leadership. The opponent does not believe in such a view. This is a reply to a person, who says that the Prophet (s) had delivered all that our welfare depended on, and what he was going to deliver in the future was not expedient to be delivered presently; and therefore, his occultation was reasonable, whereas, the Imam is not like that according to you, as his active leadership in every instant is a grace to creation, therefore, in no circumstance his occultation is warranted and his aid and protection is necessary, so he may appear and the legitimate reason of not following religious laws by the duty-bound (Mukallaf) be removed. This is invalid, because we explained that though the Prophet (s) had delivered all that mankind’s welfare depended on at that time, his leadership, orders and prohibitions were needed without any dispute amongst scholars. However, despite that, it was permissible for him to go into hiding. Likewise is the Imam. Besides, Allah’s order to the Prophet (s) to hide in the mountains at one time and in the cave the other, is a sort of protection, because it is not full protection, in which He would literally defend him against his enemies through making his enemies weak or strengthening him through angels, because it is possible to conceive harm to the religion stemming from strengthening him through such measures. Therefore, it is not right for God to do that. And if it should be devoid of any aspect of wrong, and God knows that expediency requires so, He would strengthen him through angels and defend him against his enemies. And when He does not do that, and it is proved that He is All-Wise and that it is incumbent upon Him to disallow any legitimate excuse on part of the duty-bound(Mukallafin) not to obey the religious laws, we discern that His taking such measures would evoke no benefit, but rather it would be inexpedient. What we say is that in general it is incumbent on Allah to strengthen the hand of the Imam to facilitate his uprising and his administration of society and to perform that through angels and men. However, when He does not do that through angels, we discern it is because it involves inexpediency. Therefore, this must be rendered through men; and should they not perform that, it is something of their own misdoing not that of the Lord’s. Thus, this explication invalidates all criticisms of this sort expressed at this juncture. If it is permissible for the Prophet (s) to undergo hiding, inasmuch as he was needed, due to the fear of harm, and the blame in this regard is on individuals, who threatened him and forced him to go into hiding, likewise is the occultation of the Imam. To make a distinction in this regard in terms of the length and shortness of occultation, is not correct, because there is no difference between short and brief occultation and lengthy and protracted occultation, since when the blame of hiding does not rest on the person who undergoes hiding, bur rather on the ones who have forced him to it, the cause that has prompted the hiding can have a long duration as it can a short one."

Where is the similarity between his fear from his enemies and the fear of his forefathers, if there is no scarcity of reflection? Moreover, when anyone of his forefathers was murdered or died, there was someone qualified for Imamate from their progeny to replace him and fill his position, whereas the case of the Master of the Age is diametrically opposite to this, since it is well-known that no one is to succeed him and take his position. Therefore, the difference between the two instances is clear."

However, it does not follow that people are not bound by these religious duties. Because if the reason for the occultation is his fear for his life from those who have threatened him, the ones who have forced him into hiding are ultimately responsible for the missed teachings of the Imam and his leadership, as they forced him into occultation. And should these people stop threatening him, he will appear and the grace of his leadership will materialize and the teachings he has to offer will manifest. Therefore, he has not caused this occultation of religious teachings. However, if the enemies do not end the fear and it continues, they are responsible for both cases. This argument is strong and supported by principles."

This is criticized, because the wise Shia cannot fail to discern the harm posed to him and themselves from expressing their gathering with the Imam. So, how can they inform about it while they know the extent of the general harm that is threatening them? If this is possible in the case of one or two individuals, this cannot be said about the community of his Shia to whom he is not appearing. Besides, it follows that his Shia have lost the occasion of benefiting from him in a way that cannot be made up for, because if his hiding is based on the prediction of something they will do in the future, it is not within their capacity to do something that will facilitate the rise of the Imam. This precipitates the nullification of the religious duties in which the Imam is grace for them. There is another view that the reason of his hiding from his devotees is due to his enemies; because the subjects, both devotees and enemies, can benefit from the Imam when his reign prevails and he runs the affairs and he is apparent and is exerting leadership without any encumbrance or challenge, whereas, the enemies have obviously barred and prevented him from this."

If there is no benefit in this sort of meeting that is restricted and specific, because he is ordained for all, this suggests that the Imamiyah Shia have not availed any benefit from the demise of Amirul Momineen until the days of Hasan Ibn Ali Askari and until the Qaim. It also suggests that the devotees of Amirul Momineen and his Shia did not enjoy any benefit from seeing him prior to his assumption of administration and rule. The asserter of these words has reached where no sensible man would. Besides, even if it is accepted that the Imam can only benefit when he is apparent to all of the subjects and his orders are executed over them, their view loses its tenability from another aspect, namely, it follows that the religious rules for the sake of which the Imam is the grace, will lose their imperativeness. Because if the Imam does not appear to them, probably it is not because of them and nor it is in their capacity to remove the cause of his occultation. Therefore, the religious rules must not be binding for them. Because if one nation can prevent the grace of another nation of duty bound, and the duties for which that grace was a grace, remain binding for them, on the same token, it is possible that one duty-bound may prevent another through imprisonment or other similar means, which he cannot remove, and on virtue of which he cannot walk, but the duty of walking shall continue to bind him. They cannot differentiate between such imprisonment and grace, as the former renders the duty impossible and its occurrence is not imaginable, whereas the absence of grace is not like that."

That can be the case with regard to a religious duty that is sometimes clear and sometimes confusing with some other duty; and if the capacity with respect to both duties exists, then when the devotee introspects and sees that the Imam does not appear to him and he does not consider the aforementioned wrong reasons of the occultation valid, he realizes that the reason of the occultation is indebted to himself; and when he realizes that the strongest proof is what we mentioned, he discerns that the shortcoming is his own with respect to the miraculous signs and their conditions. Therefore, he must reflect on it and get rid of doubts and anything causing confusion. Whoever toils in this regard and reflects well, will definitely discover the difference between right and wrong.

Many a time, the condition of occultation is more so effective in this regard, because in such a case, the Imam can be with him in his land and in his neighborhood and watching him without his knowledge."

Anyone who thinks that this is the proof of the falsity of the Imamiyah belief, he is not familiar with practices in the world. Imam Sadiq Ja’far Ibn Muhammad did the same when he addressed his final will to five people, the first of whom was the ruler of that time, Mansur. He did not exclusively address his son Musa in order to protect him. He addressed Rabi, the judge of the time, and his concubine Hamida Barbariyya, and he mentioned his son Musa Ibn Ja’far last in order to hide his position and protect his life. He did not mention along with his son Musa any other of his sons. Perhaps it was to exclude the possibility of someone claiming the position of Imamate after him on the basis of his inclusion among addressees of the final will. And had not been Musa prominent and well known amongst his sons, and his position and relationship to him famous, and his scholarship and erudition well established, and had he been unknown, Imam Sadiq would not have mentioned him in his final will and would have sufficed on the others, as did Hasan Ibn Ali, the father of the Master of the Age."

The Messenger of Allah (s) asked: “Till where, O Abu Laila?” I replied: “In Paradise, O Messenger of Allah (s).” The Holy Prophet (s) remarked: “All right, if Allah so wills.” After that I presented the following couplets to the Messenger of Allah (s): There is no goodness in forbearance and magnanimity, when they are not accompanied with evil and anger, till purity does not stain the period of forbearance or period of anger. And there is no goodness in ignorance also, when it is not accompanied with forbearance and severity does not make amends for it with kindness and tolerance. At that moment the Holy Prophet (s) said: May Allah bless you."

Madh-haj was the mother of Malik bin Adad and the reason of her being named thus was that she was born on a hill named as Madh-haj. Abu Hatim says: When the death of Harith approached, he gathered his children and said: My children, I have reached an age of a hundred and sixty years, but so far I have neither made peace with any traitor nor befriended any transgressor or infidel, nor flirted with cousins and sisters-in-law. I have never kept a woman of loose character in my house. I have never exposed the secrets of my friends. I follow the religion of Prophet Shuaib and except for me, Asad bin Khuzaima and Tamim bin Murrah, no one in the Arab Peninsula follows this faith. So remember my will and live on my religion. Continue to fear the Almighty Allah as He is sufficient for you in every way. Never disobey Him as you would be destroyed and your city and abode would be terrified of your destruction [It is an allusion of divine chastisement]. My sons, be united and never should you fall into discord. Without any doubt, a death of honor is better than a life of degradation and helplessness. What is destined would come to pass. Everything is of two different types. Thus time is also of two kinds: A time of prosperity and a time of troubles. People are also of two types: One kind will benefit you and another will harm you. Also remember that you should take in marriage, a woman who is compatible to your status and is chaste. Avoid foolish girls as their issues will be useless. Those who cut off relations will never get peace. There is enmity in discord with the people of your community. That is if you oppose them, they will become inimical to you. No matter how numerous you may be; if you have no unity, you are in great trouble. Goodness erases evil. To reciprocate evil with evil is to participate in evil. Sins destroy good deeds. Breaking off relations creates sorrow. Disrespect destroys blessings. Disowning of parents leads to destruction. It reduces population and houses are destroyed. Bad behavior cuts off benefits. Mutual enmity causes separations. He had composed the following couplets: I spent my youth and I wasted it; and I destroyed one day with another. I lived with three wives and all of them passed away and I have also become an old man. My food is less and my getting up is with difficulty and the long life span has shortened my steps. I remain awake the nights and observe the stars and contemplate on the hidden and apparent aspects of my life. These were some examples of Arabs who had the good fortune of having long life spans and their accounts are preserved in books of history."

He is also known as Lajalmaha Tai and Bani Tai are his descendants. His account is very long. Yahabir bin Malik bin Adad was one of his nephews. Each of them lived for 500 years and there was a battle between them regarding a pasture land. Jalhama thought that in this way his whole clan will be destroyed. So he left that place and traveled a great distance; that is why he began to be called as Tai. He was the owner of two mountains in Tai, named Aja and Salma. He is also having a very lengthy account."

If our opponent accepts this, but says this is out of the ordinary norms, we have already responded that it is not out of all of the ordinary events.

We have proved the possibility of these events in our books and explained that extraordinary events prove the truth of the person, who brings them forth; and we discern he is either prophet, Imam or a virtuous man.

So, when would it be possible for you to give me some time so that I may ask you something?’ Jabir replied, ‘Whenever you wish.’ Thus, when my father met him in privacy, he asked, “O Jabir! Tell me about the Tablet, which you saw with my mother, Fatima, the daughter of the Messenger of Allah (s) and what did she tell you as to what was written in it?” Jabir replied, ‘I hold Allah as witness that I went to visit your mother, Fatima during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah (s) to congratulate her for Husain’s birth. I saw in her hand a green Tablet, which I thought to be of emerald and its writing was as bright as sunlight. I asked her, ‘May my parents be sacrificed for you, O daughter of Allah’s Messenger (s)! What is this Tablet?’ She (s) replied, “This is the Tablet, which Allah, Mighty and Glorified be He, has gifted to the Messenger of Allah (s). In it is the name of my father, the name of Ali, the name of my two sons and the names of the successors from my progeny. In turn, my father gave it to me so that I may rejoice through it.” Jabir said, ‘Thus, your mother Fatima gave it to me. I read it and copied it.’ My father asked, “O Jabir! Can you show it (the copied manuscript) to me?” He replied in the affirmative. My father accompanied Jabir to his house, where he took out a book from a parchment and giving it to my father said, ‘I hold Allah as witness that this is what I saw written in the Tablet: [Text of the Tablet of Fatima (Lauh Fatima)] In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful This is a Book from Allah, the Mighty, the Wise to Muhammad, His light, His ambassador, His veil and His proof. The trustworthy spirit (Jibraeel) has descended with it from the Lord of the worlds. O Muhammad! Magnify my names, be grateful for My bounties and do not deny My endowments. Verily I am Allah; there is no god, but Me, the Destroyer of the oppressors, the Degrader of the tyrants and the Establisher of the Day of Judgment. Verily I am Allah, there is no god, but Me. Whoever expects grace from other than Me or fears other than My justice and My punishment, I will punish him in such a way that I will not punish anybody in this manner in the worlds. Hence, worship only Me and rely only on Me. Indeed, I did not raise a messenger, completed his days and terminated his duration, but that I appointed for him a successor. Certainly, I made you superior over all other Prophets and made your successor superior over all other successors. After him, I honored you with your two grandsons: Hasan and Husain. I made Hasan the mine of My knowledge after the end of the days of his father and I made Husain the treasure-chest of My revelation, honored him with martyrdom and sealed it for him with eternal bliss. So, he is the best of the martyrs and the highest of them in grade before Me. I have placed My perfect word with him and the complete proof near him. Through his progeny, I shall reward and I shall punish. The first of them is the chief of the worshippers and the adornment of My past friends, then his son (Muhammad), who resembles his grandfather al-Mahmud , the splitter of My knowledge and the mine of My wisdom. Soon, those who doubt concerning his son, Ja’far will be destroyed. He who rejects him has rejected Me. I speak the truth, I will indeed honor the position of Ja’far and make him happy vis-à-vis his Shias, his helpers and his friends. After him, I have selected Musa and there will be a blinding, dark corruption so that the spark of My obedience is not terminated, My proof is not hidden and My friends are not afflicted with misfortune. Beware! Whoever denies even one of them, he has denied My bounty. Whoever changes one verse from My Book, then indeed he has attributed a lie unto Me. Then woe unto the liars, the deniers with the termination of the duration of My servant, My beloved and My chosen one, Musa. Verily, the one who denies the eighth is as if he has denied all My friends (Imams). Ali is My friend, My helper and the one, upon whom I have placed Prophethood’s burden of proof and conferred upon him mastership. An arrogant devil will murder him. He will be buried in a city, which the righteous servant has built, next to the worst of My creatures. I speak the truth; I will soothe his eyes with Muhammad, his son and his successor after him. He is the heir of My knowledge, the mine of My wisdom, the place of My joy and My proof upon My creatures. None shall believe in him, but that Paradise will be his abode and I will allow him to intercede for seventy of his family members, even if all of them are eligible for Hell. I will complete his bliss with his son Ali, My friend, My helper, My witness amongst My creatures and My trustee upon My revelation. From him, I will bring forth Hasan, the caller to My path and the treasurer of My knowledge. Thereafter, I will complete this (chain of Imamate) with his son, M-H-M-D, mercy for the worlds. He will possess the perfection of Musa, the brightness of Isa and the patience of Ayyub. Soon, My friends will be humiliated in his time and their heads will be gifted as trophies like the heads of Turks and Daylamites. They will be killed, they will be burnt, they will live in a state of fear, terror and trepidation. The earth will be colored with their blood and wailing and sobbing will be commonplace among their womenfolk. They are My true friends! Through them, I will repel all blinding and dark mischief, remove the earthquakes and do away with the burdens and the chains. They are those upon them is the blessing of their Lord and mercy. And they are the guided ones. Abdur Rahman bin Saalim said: Abu Basir says, ‘If you do not hear in your time anything, but this tradition, it will suffice for you. Hence, conceal it, except from those who are worthy of it.’"

Amirul Momineen that he said: The Messenger of Allah (s) said on the eve of his departure from the world: “O Abul Hasan, bring a scroll and pen and ink.” Then he dictated his will, till he came to the words: “O Ali, very soon after me there will be twelve Imams and after them there would be twelve Mahdis. And you are the first of the twelve Imams. The Almighty Allah has named you as Ali Murtadha, chief of believers, the great truthful one (who testified to the Prophet), the great discriminator (and through you truth would be distinguished from falsehood) and named you as Mamun and Mahdi, these names are not appropriate for anyone else other than you.” “O Ali, you are my successor and in charge of my Ahle Bayt , whether I am alive or dead. In the same way, you will be my successor on my wives, thus ones you leave in my marriage contract would meet me tomorrow on Judgment Day and I am aloof from one you divorce; and on Judgment Day neither would she see me nor would I see her. After me you are the successor and Caliph on my Ummah. When your death approaches, you will transfer my successorship and legateeship to my son, Hasan, the righteous and rightful. When his death comes, he would entrust it to my son, Husain, the pure and the martyr and when his death comes, he would hand it over to the chief of the worshippers and the owner of corns (Ali) and when his end comes, he would transfer it to his son, Muhammad Baqir and when his last moments approach, he would entrust it to his son, Ja’far Sadiq and when his death comes, he would leave it to his son, Musa Kadhim and when his death comes, he would leave it to his son, Ali (Ridha) and when his end comes, he would give it to his son, Muhammad, the trustworthy (Taqi) and when his death arrives, he would present it to his son, Ali (Nasih). And when his death comes, he would transfer it to his son, Hasan (Fazil) and when his death arrives, he would leave it to his son (Muhammad), who is the protector of the Shariah of Muhammad. These were the twelve Imams and after them there will be twelve Mahdis. When the last moments of the twelfth Imam will approach, he will hand it over to his son, who is the foremost proximate; and he has three names: My name, name of my father: Abdullah and Ahmad; and third will be Mahdi and he will be the first of the believers.”"

A Jew from Medina, who was a leader of Jews and whom the Jews considered to be the most knowledgeable person of the time, came to Umar and said: O Umar, I want to embrace Islam at your hands. If you can answer my questions, I would know that you are the most knowledgeable follower of this Book and Sunnah. Umar said: “I am not having this capability, but I will show you one who is the most knowledgeable about our Book and Prophet’s Sunnah and you can ask all you want from him and it is him.” And he pointed to Imam Ali ” The Jew said: O Umar, if it is as such as you say, what right do you have that people should pay allegiance to you while that person is most knowledgeable of you all? Umar told him to shut up and warned him. After that the Jew arose and came to Ali and asked: “Are you like Umar has told?” Imam Ali asked: what did Umar say? The Jew explained the situation to him and said: I will ask you some questions and I want to know whether anyone has asked you about them; and whether you are true in your claim that you are the best and the most knowledgeable of nation, so that I may also enter the fold of Islam. Imam Ali said: Yes, I am as Umar has told you. Ask me whatever you like and I will answer, if Allah wills. The Jew said: I will ask you about three, three and one thing. Imam Ali said: Why don’t you say: I’ll ask you about seven things? The Jew said: No, first I will ask you about three and if you give the right answers, I will ask you about another three and if you give the right answers, I will ask you the last one. If you fail to answer the first three, I will keep quiet and not ask you anything else. Imam Ali said: Ask whatever you like. The Jew said: Which was the first stone to be placed on the earth, the first tree that has grew on the earth and the first fountain that flowed on the earth? Amirul Momineen replied to all three questions. Then the Jew asked: How many Imams of guidance are there in this nation? In what position Muhammad would be in Paradise? Who would be with Muhammad in Paradise? Imam Ali said: This nation has twelve guiding Imams from the progeny of the Prophet of this nation and they are from my descendants. The position of Muhammad (s) is in the best and the most honored location of the Garden of Eden. As for those from this nation, who would be in the company of the Messenger of Allah (s) are the same twelve from his progeny and their mother and their grandmother – mother of their mother and their progeny – no one else will share this."

A man with an elegant appearance and dress nicely entered and saluted Amirul Momineen . His Eminence returned his salutations. He said, “O Amirul Momineen , I wish to ask you about three things.

He asked: “When a person sleeps, where does his soul go? How does man remember one thing and forgets the other? Whom does a child resemble more, the paternal uncles or the maternal.” His Eminence told Imam Hasan : O Abu Muhammad, reply to him. And Imam Hasan replied to him. The man said, “I bear witness that there is no god except Allah and I have always borne witness thus. And I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah and I have always testified to it. And I bear witness that you are the legatee of the Messenger (s), and one who establishes his proof and evidence (pointing towards Amirul Momineen he said, “I have always testified this.” Then gesturing to Imam Hasan , he said, “I bear witness that you are the legatee of Amirul Momineen and one who shall establish his proof and evidence. That is you and the one who proves the prophethood of the Messenger of Allah (s). And I bear witness that Husain bin Ali is the legatee of his brother and he is the one to establish the proof after him. And I bear witness that Ali bin Husain is the Imam after Husain . And I bear witness that Muhammad bin Ali is the Imam after Ali bin Husain . And I bear witness that Ja’far bin Muhammad is the Imam after Muhammad bin Ali .

And peace be on you, O Amirul Momineen !” After that he arose and departed from there. His Eminence told Imam Hasan , “O Aba Muhammad, go and see where he goes.” Imam Hasan went out and returned after a moment and said, “He placed one foot outside the Masjid and after that I don’t know where he disappeared.” Amirul Momineen said, “O Aba Muhammad, do you know who it was?” Imam Hasan replied “Allah, His Messenger and Amirul Momineen know better.” Ali said, “He was Khizr.” So far we have only mentioned some reports (on this topic) and if we mentioned all reports narrated through Shia on this subject, this book would definitely become very long.

Besides, the narration by the two different denominations, which have different beliefs, is a proof of the veracity of the narrations they both agree upon. That is because it is customary that anyone who believes in an idea, which is proved through narration, then he has every motivation to narrate those narrations, and his opponent will have every motivation to invalidate his narrations or to weaken him and reject his narrations. Such is the practice in praising individuals or criticizing them. When we see that a group averse to this one narrates the same narrations they have narrated, and have not questioned its narration or its content, this indicates that God has undertaken the narration thereof and has forced them to narrate it; and this is a proof of the veracity of the narration. The proof of the fact that our Imams are intended by these narrations is that when it is proved through these traditions that the Imams are twelve Imams and that they neither exceed this number, nor are they short of it, our creed is proved, because the Ummah is divided into denominations: we, who believe in this number and believe in the Imamate of our Imams, and others who do not believe in this number and their Imamate. If someone should believe in the number and does not believe in their Imamate, he is treading outside the bounds of consensus (Ijma), and any belief outside the bounds of consensus (Ijma) is definitely void."

These traditions state that the Master of the Age will have occultations and they describe its qualities and the disputes and events that will take place during it. They state that he will have two occultations, one of which will be longer than the other, and that in the first one communication will be open with him and in the second, his news will not be coming. The later events unfolded as predicted by the traditions. Had they not been correct, and had his Imamate not been valid, they had not corresponded with events, which happened later, because that cannot happen, but through God’s delivery through the tongue of His Messenger. This path of reasoning is also a measure on the basis of which scholars have previously argued."

Is it out of desire for the earth?” He said: “No, by Allah, I have never desired it, nor for what is in the world even for one day.

He is the Mahdi and he would fill up the earth with equity as it will be fraught with oppression and injustice.

من أية حادثة تستذرف دمعتك وتستمطر عبرتك؟ وأية حالة حتمت عليك هذا المأتم؟ قـال: فزفر الصـادق عليـه السـلام زفـرة انتفـخ منها جـوفه واشتد منها خوفه، فقال: ويكم، إني نظرت صبيحة هذا اليوم في كتاب الجفر المشتمل على علم البلايا والمنايا وعلم ما كان وما يكون إلى يوم القيامة، الذي خص الله تقدس اسمه به محمدا والأئمة من بعده، وتأملت فيه مولد قائمنا عليه السلام وغيبته وإبطاءه وطول عمره وبلوى المؤمنين من بعده في ذلك الزمان، وتولد الشكوك في قلوب الشيعة من طول غيبته، وارتداد أكثرهم عن دينه وخلعهم ربقة الإسلام من أعناقهم التي قال الله عز وجل ﴿وكُلَّ إِنسانٍ أَلْزَمْناهُ طائِرَهُ فِي عُنُقِهِ﴾، يعني الولاية، فأخذتني الرقة واستولت علي الأحزان. فقلنا: يا ابن رسول الله، كرمنا وفضلنا بإشراكك إيانا في بعض ما أنت تعلمه من علم ذلك. قال: إن الله تعالى ذكره أدار في القائم منا ثلاثة أدارها لثلاثة من الرسل؛ قدر مولده تقدير مولد موسى عليه السلام، وقدر غيبته تقدير غيبة عيسى عليه السلام، وقدر إبطاءه تقدير إبطاء نوح عليه السلام. وجعل له من بعد ذلك عمر العبد الصالح- أعني الخضر عليه السلام- دليلا على عمره. فقلنا: اكشف لنا يا ابن رسول الله عن وجوه هذه المعاني. قال: أما مولد موسى عليه السلام، فإن فرعون لما وقف على أن زوال ملكه على يده أمر بإحضار الكهنة فدلوا على نسبه وأنه يكون من بني إسرائيل، فلم يزل يأمر أصحابه بشق بطون الحوامل من نساء بني إسرائيل حتى قتل في طلبه نيفا وعشرين ألف مولود، وتعذر عليه الوصول إلى قتل موسى عليه السلام بحفظ الله تعالى إياه. كذلك بنو أمية وبنو العباس لما أن وقفوا على أن به زوال مملكة الأمراء والجبابرة منهم على يدي القائم منا ناصبونا العداوة ووضعوا سيوفهم في قتل أهل بيت رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم وإبادة نسله، طمعا منهم في الوصول إلى قتل القائم عليه السلام. فأبى الله أن يكشف أمره لواحد من الظلمة إلا أن يتم نوره ولو كره المشركون. وأما غيبة عيسى عليه السلام، فإن اليهود والنصارى اتفقت على أنه قُتل، فكذبهم الله عز وجل بقوله ﴿وما قَتَلُوهُ وما صَلَبُوهُ ولكِنْ شُبِّهَ لَهُمْ﴾. كذلك غيبة القائم، فإن الأمة ستنكرهـا لطولهـا؛ فمن قائل يقول: إنه لم يولد! وقـائل يفتري بقوله: إنه ولد ومات! وقائل يكفر بقوله إن حادي عشرنا كان عقيما! وقائل يمرق بقوله إنه يتعدى إلى ثالث عشر فصاعدا! وقائل يعصي الله بدعواه أن روح القائم عليه السلام ينطق في هيكل غيره! وأما إبطاء نوح عليه السلام، فإنه لما استنزل العقوبة من السماء بعث الله إليه جبرئيل عليه السلام معه سبع نويات،فقال: يا نبي الله، إن الله جل اسمه يقول لك إن هؤلاء خلائقي وعبادي، لست أبيدهم بصاعقة من صواعقي إلا بعد تأكيد الدعوة وإلزام الحجة. فعاود اجتهادك في الدعوة لقومك فإني مثيبك عليه واغرس هذا النوى فإن لك في نباتها وبلوغها وإدراكها إذا أثمرت الفرج والخلاص، وبشر بذلك من تبعك من المؤمنين. فلما نبتت الأشجار وتأزرت وتسوقت وأغصنت وزها الثمر عليها بعد زمان طويل استنجز من الله العدة فأمره الله تعالى أن يغرس من نوى تلك الأشجار ويعاود الصبر والاجتهاد ويؤكد الحجة على قومه، فأخبر بذلك الطوائف التي آمنت به فارتد منهم ثلاثمائة رجل وقالوا: لو كان ما يدعيه نوح حقا لما وقع في عدته خلف! ثم إن الله تعالى لم يزل يأمره عند إدراكها كل مرة أن يغرس تارة بعد أخرى إلى أن غرسها سبع مرات،وما زالت تلك الطوائف من المؤمنين ترتد منهم طائفة بعد طائفة إلى أن عادوا إلى نيف وسبعين رجلا. فأوحى الله عز وجل عند ذلك إليه وقال: الآن أسفر الصبح عن الليل لعينك حين صرح الحق عن محضه وصفا الأمر للايمان من الكدر بارتداد كل من كانت طينته خبيثة،فلو أني أهلكت الكفار وأبقيت من ارتد من الطوائف التي كانت آمنت بك لما كنت صدقت وعدي السابق للمؤمنين الذين أخلصوا لي التوحيد من قومك واعتصموا بحبل نبوتك بأن أستخلفهم في الأرض وأمكن لهم دينهم وأبدل خوفهم بالأمن لكي تخلص العبادة لي بذهاب الشك من قلوبهم. وكيف يكون الاستخلاف والتمكين وبدل الخوف بالأمن مني لهم مع ما كنت أعلم من ضعف يقين الذين ارتدوا وخبث طينتهم وسوء سرائرهم التي كانت نتائج النفـاق وسـنوخ الضـلالة؟ فلـو أنهـم تنسموا من الملك الذي أوتي المؤمنون وقت الاستخلاف إذا هلكت أعداؤهم لنشقوا روائح صفاته ولاستحكم سرائر نفاقهم وتأبد خبال ضلالة قلوبهم ولكاشفوا إخوانهم بالعداوة وحاربوهم على طلب الرئاسة والتفرد بالأمر والنهي عليهم! وكيف يكون التمكين في الدين وانتشار الأمر في المؤمنين مع إثارة الفتن وإيقاع الحروب كلا ﴿واصْنَعِ الْفُلْكَ بِأَعْيُنِنا ووَحْيِنا﴾. قال الصادق عليه السلام: وكذلك القائم عليه السلام، فإنه تمتد غيبته ليصرح الحق عن محضه ويصفو الإيمان من الكدر بارتداد كل من كانت طينته خبيثة من الشيعة الذين يخشى عليهم النفاق إذا أحسوا بالاستخلاف والتمكين والأمن المنتشر في عهد القائم عليه السلام. قال المفضل: فقلت: يا ابن رسول الله، فإن النواصب تزعم أن هذه الآية أنزلت في أبي بكر وعمر وعثمان وعلي. فقال: لا هدى الله قلوب الناصبة! متى كان الدين الذي ارتضاه الله ورسوله متمكنا بانتشار الأمن في الأمة وذهاب الخوف من قلوبها وارتفاع الشك من صدورها في عهد واحد من هؤلاء أو في عهد علي عليه السلام مع ارتداد المسلمين والفتن التي كانت تثور في أيامهم والحروب والفتن التي كانت تشب بين الكفار وبينهم؟ ثم تلا الصادق عليه السلام هذه الآية مثلا لإبطاء القائم عليه السلام: ﴿حَتَّى إِذَا اسْتَيْأَسَ الرُّسُلُ وظَنُّوا أَنَّهُمْ قَدْ كُذِبُوا جاءَهُمْ نَصْرُنا…﴾ الآية. وأما العبد الصالح- أعني الخضرعليه السلام- فإن الله تعالى ما طول عمره لنبوة قررها له ولا لكتاب نزل عليه ولا لشريعة ينسخ بها شريعة من كان قبله من الأنبياء عليهم السلام ولا لإمامة يلزم عباده الاقتداء بها ولا لطاعة يفرضها. بلى،إن الله تعالى لما كان في سابق علمه أن يقدر من عمر القائم عليه السلام في أيام غيبته ما يقدره وعلم ما يكون من إنكار عباده بمقدار ذلك العمر في الطول طول عمر العبد الصالح من غير سبب أوجب ذلك إلا لعلة الاستدلال به على عمر القائم عليه السلام ليقطع بذلك حجة المعاندين لئلا يكون للناس على الله حجة. و الأخبار في هذا المعنى أكثر من أن تحصى ذكرنا طرفا منها لئلا يطول به الكتاب. فإن قيل: هذه كلها أخبار آحاد لا يعول على مثلها في هذه المسألة لأنها مسألة علمية. قلنا: موضع الاستدلال من هذه الأخبار ما تضمن الخبر بالشيء قبل كونه فكان كما تضمنه فكان ذلك دلالة على صحة ما ذهبنا إليه من إمامة ابن الحسن لأن العلم بما يكون لا يحصل إلا من جهة علام الغيوب. فلو لم يرو إلا خبر واحد ووافق مخبره ما تضمنه الخبر لكان ذلك كافيا ولذلك كان ما تضمنه القرآن من الخبر بالشيء قبل كونه دليلا على صدق النبي صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم وأن القرآن من قبل الله تعالى وإن كانت المواضع التي تضمنت ذلك محصورة ومع ذلك مسموعة من مخبر واحد لكن دل على صدقه من الجهة التي قلناها. على أن هذه الأخبار متواتر بها لفظا ومعنى.فأما اللفظ فإن الشيعة تواترت بكل خبر منه،وأما المعنى فإن كثرة الأخبار واختلاف جهاتها وتباين طرقها وتباعد رواتها يدل على صحتها لأنه لا يجوز أن يكون كلها باطلة. ولذلك يستدل في مواضع كثيرة على معجزات النبي صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم التي هي سوى القرآن وأمور كثيرة في الشرع تتواتر معنى وإن كان كل لفظ منها منقولا من جهة الآحاد وذلك معتمد عند من خالفنا في هذه المسألة فلا ينبغي أن يتركوه وينسوه إذا جئنا إلى الكلام في الإمامة والعصبية لا ينبغي أن تنتهي بالإنسان إلى حد يجحد الأمور المعلومة. وهذا الذي ذكرناه معتبر في مدائح الرجال وفضائلهم ولذلك استدل على سخاء حاتم وشجاعة عمرو وغير ذلك بمثل ذلك وإن كان كل واحد مما يروى من عطاء حاتم ووقوف عمرو في موقف من المواقف من جهة الآحاد وهذا واضح.,"H 129 - A group has narrated from Abu Mufaddal Muhammad bin Abdullah bin Muhammad bin Ubaidullah bin Matlab that he said: Narrated to me Abul Husain Muhammad bin Bahr bin Sahl Shaibani Rahni from Ali bin Harith from Saad bin Mansur Jawashini from Ahmad bin Ali Budaili from his father from Sudair Sairafi that he said: I, along with Mufaddal Ibn Umar, Abu Basir, Aban Ibn Taghlib came to our master, Abu Abdullah Ja’far Ibn Muhammad and found him sitting on bare earth. He had a Khaibari woolen cloak ringed at the neck, did not have any pockets and had short sleeves. He was crying like a deeply afflicted and bereaved mother of a child from the depths of a heart that was full of mourning. Grief had appeared in the sides of his face and the change had spread on both his cheeks and tears were rolling on the sides of his visage, as he was saying: “My master, your occultation has taken away my night’s sleep; it has narrowed my bed for me and has snatched away solace from my heart. My master, your occultation has turned my tragedies into the atrocities of eternity! The loss of one after the other perishes a crowd and a multitude. No more I feel the tear that drops from my eye and the moan that faintly leaves my chest from the places of tragedies and past calamities, except that it exemplifies before my eye the greatest and cruelest of catastrophes, the most dismal and disdainful mishaps, mixed with your wrath and calamities coupled with your anger.” Sudair says: Our hearts and minds were overwhelmed by that terrifying scene. We thought that it was a sign of a dreadful shattering or times have brought him a calamity. So we said: “May Allah, O son of the best of the creation, never bring tears into your eyes. Why are you weeping and what has caused this mourning?” Sudair says: Imam Sadiq took a deep sigh that his chest expanded and his grief enhanced and he said: “I looked at the Book of Jafr this morning, and that is the book that encompasses the knowledge of deaths, trials and tribulations and the knowledge of all that has been and all that will be until Judgment Day, which Allah, glory to His name, has exclusively imparted to Muhammad and the Imams after him, peace be unto him and them. I saw therein the birth of our Qaim and his occultation and its protraction and the length of his lifespan and the trials of the believers through him after him in that period and the generation of doubts in their hearts due to the length of his disappearance and apostasy of most of them from their religion and their desertion of Islam, about which Allah, glory to His name, has said: “And We have made every man’s actions to cling to his neck…” (17:13) …which is Mastership (Wilayah); so emotions overpowered me and grief overwhelmed me.” We said: “O son of Allah’s Messenger, dignify us and bestow honor upon us by sharing some of what you know from the knowledge.” He said: “Allah, the Exalted, has bestowed three qualities to the Qaim of ours, which He gave to three of the apostles. He foreordained his birth like the birth of Musa ; his disappearance like the disappearance of Isa ; and his longevity like the longevity of Nuh . Moreover, He made the lifespan of His virtuous servant Khizr, a proof of his lifespan.” I said: “Remove the curtains for us, O son of Allah’s Messenger, from the faces of these concepts.” He said: “As for the birth of Musa: When the Firon discerned that the demise of his kingdom is near, he summoned the soothsayers, who foretold him about his lineage and that he will be from the Children of Israel. Firon did not cease to have his men rip open the abdomens of pregnant ladies from Bani Israel, until he killed in the pursuit of Musa, twenty and some odd thousand babies. He was unable to murder Musa, for Allah, the Exalted, protected him. Likewise, when the Umayyads and the Abbasids discovered that the demise of their kingdom and that of their kings and tyrants will be at the hands of the Qaim from us, they showed enmity to us and took their swords out for the murder of the House of the Messenger of Allah (s) and to cut off his progeny in order to make certain they have killed the Qaim . However, Allah dislikes not revealing His Command for one of the oppressors until His light is full, even if the pagans may dislike this. As for the disappearance of Isa: The Jews and the Christians formed unanimity that he has been killed; whereas Allah belied them in His verse: “and they did not kill him nor did they crucify him, but it appeared to them so (like Isa)…” (4:157) Likewise is the disappearance of the Qaim , since one community denies it for its length - ranging from one misguided person who says, ‘He was never born’; to another who says, ‘He was born and he died’; to another who rejects faith by saying that our Eleventh was childless; to another who deviates by saying, ‘This will increase to thirteen and upwards’, and another who sins against God, the Exalted, by saying, ‘The spirit of the Qaim speaks through the body of someone else’. “As for the longevity of Nuh: When he prayed for the descent of punishment against his people from the heavens, Allah, the Exalted, sent Jibraeel, the Trusted Spirit, with seven kernels, and he said: ‘O Apostle of Allah, Allah, the Exalted, says to you, ‘They are My creation and My servants. I will not destroy them with a lightning from My thunderbolts until the call has been stressed upon and the proof has become binding. Continue your hard labor in calling your people, for I will reward you for that. Plant these kernels, because your relief and liberation will be at its plantation, outgrowth, and fruition when it reaches fruition. Give this glad tiding to your believing followers.’ When the trees grew and thrived and their trunks and branches developed and spread out and their fruits grew big, he asked Allah, the Exalted, for the fulfillment of the promise. Allah, the Exalted, ordered him to plant the seeds of those trees and retain patience and hard work and continue calling the people. He informed the nations that believed in him; three hundred men of them turned away from him and said: ‘If what Nuh is claiming were true, the promise of his Lord would not have been violated.’ Then Allah, the Exalted, continued to order him every time to plant the seeds until they had been planted seven times. Nations of believers continued to lose congregations until there were left only seventy and some odd men. At that time, did Allah, the Exalted, sent a message to him and said: ‘O Nuh, now the dawn on your eyes has broken the night as the truth has manifested with clarity and the order of belief has become pure from impurity by the apostasy of everyone who had a wicked disposition. If I had destroyed the disbelievers and kept those who have apostatized from amongst the believers in you, I would not have fulfilled My early promise to the believers from your people, who were sincere in their belief in Me and had adhered to the rope of your Prophethood that I would make them heirs in earth and empower for them their religion and replace their fear with security, so that worship be pure for Me by the departure of doubts from their hearts. How could I provide heirship and empowerment and replacement of fear with security, while I know the weakness of belief of the people who apostatized and their wicked dispositions and their evil insides, which were the outcomes of hypocrisy and the initiation of misguidance? If they had procured from Me the kingdom that will be given to the believers at the time of heirship when I will have killed their enemies, they would have sniffed the smells of its attractions, and it would have strengthened the inner secrets of their hypocrisy, and eternalized the strings of misguidance in their hearts, and they would have faced their brothers with enmity and would have battled them in pursuit of chiefdom and the distinction of commanding and forbidding. And how can the religion’s empowerment and commands spread amongst the believers coexist with rise of mischief and occurrence of wars? Never! Build the ark under Our eyes and as We reveal.’” Imam Sadiq said: “Likewise is the Qaim . The days of his occultation will be prolonged, so truth may become clear and belief may become pure from impurity by the apostasy of everyone from the Shia with a wicked disposition, who are feared they are hypocrites when they expect heirship and empowerment and a vast security in the reign of the Qaim .” Mufaddal says, I asked, “O son of the Messenger of Allah, the Nawasib believe this verse: “Allah has promised to those of you who believe and do good that He will most certainly make them rulers in the earth…” (24:55) has been revealed about Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman and Ali.” He said: “May Allah not guide the hearts of the Nawasib. When was the religion, which Allah and His Messenger are pleased with, empowered through spread of security in the Ummah and departure of fear from their hearts and doubts from breasts during the reign of anyone of them? And in the reign of Ali especially with the apostasy of Muslims and mischiefs, which were occurring in their days and the wars that were breaking out between the disbelievers and between themselves?” Then Imam Sadiq recited this verse: “Until when the apostles despaired and the people became sure that they were indeed told a lie, Our help came to them…” (12:110) “As for the virtuous servant of Allah, Khizr: Allah, the Exalted, neither lengthened his lifespan because of apostleship ordained to him, nor for a book sent to him, or for a code of law replacing the previous codes from other messengers before him, or for an Imamate obliging His servants to follow him, or any obedience mandated with respect to him. Instead, since Allah, the Exalted, knew how lengthy He would make the life of the Qaim in the days of his occultation and He knew the rejection of His servants with respect to lifespan, He lengthened the lifespan of the Virtuous Servant for no other reason, but to argue on its basis for the lifespan of the Qaim and so that the argument of the opponents may cease and people may not have any proofs against Allah.” There are a large number of reports of the same connotation, but we have mentioned only some of them to avoid prolonging our book. If it is said: All these narrations are singularly narrated traditions, which cannot be conclusive in a subject as this, as it requires certainty. We will reply: Our argument is based on the portion of these narrations, which predict an event before its happening and then that event happens as predicted. This is the proof of the Imamate of Ibn Hasan, because the knowledge of an event before it happens cannot be known, but through Almighty God. Even if there were not but one tradition and its content corresponded to events later on, that is sufficient. That is why the predictions of the Quran about future events are the proofs of the truthfulness of the Messenger and that Quran is from God, the Almighty, inasmuch as it is heard from a single narrator, but it does prove this single narrator’s truth on the basis of this argument. Besides, reports in this regard are narrated in inordinate numbers (Mutawatir) both by the same words and recounting the same concepts. As for the inordinate number of traditions carrying the same wordings, the Shia have narrated each such narration by Mutawatir measures. And this concept has been narrated in inordinate numbers through different words, because the great number of narrations, their different occasions, and their distinct chains, and the remote narrators thereof, prove their veracity, because not all of them can be false. That is why on many occasions the miracles of the Prophet (s) other than the Quran, and many other themes in the Shariah are proved through Tawatur, though the wordings may be singularly narrated. This is an accepted measure before our opponents in this question. Therefore, they should not abandon and forget it when we come to discuss Imamate. It is not worthy that close-mindedness leads one to reject self-evident things. This measure is accepted in praising or denouncing men. Therefore, they have argued for the generosity of Hatim and bravery of Amr and other things in the same way, though every instance of Hatim’s generosity and Amr’s stance in the battles is a singularly narrated incident. This is abundantly clear."

Imam Hadi came to me and said: Yes, Aba Hashim, change of destiny occurred (Bada) with regard to Abu Ja’far and Almighty Allah replaced him with Abu Muhammad as He did in the case of Ismail, son of Imam Sadiq , after Imam Ja’far Sadiq had declared and mentioned him to be the Imam after him and appointed him as his successor; just as you said to yourself, although it would be displeasing to the followers of falsehood.

At last, I wrote a letter to the Imam asking him for supplication to Almighty Allah to save us from the hardships imposed on us from the ruler with regard to our youth. Reply to the letter came with a supplication of the Imam and the difficulty of our youth was also solved. At the end of the letter, the Imam had written: You wanted to ask me about the successor after the death of Abu Ja’far (Muhammad) and you are anxious due to that. Don’t be: “It is not (attributable to) Allah that He should lead a people astray after He has guided them; He even makes clear to them what they should guard against.” (9:115) Your leader after me is Abu Muhammad (Askari), my son. He has everything, which they need. God brings forward whatever He wishes and delays whatever He wishes: Whatever communications We abrogate or cause to be forgotten, We bring one better than it or like it.

It means that with regard to the brother of Muhammad, Imam Hasan Askari , a new matter was revealed from Almighty Allah and this removed doubt about his Imamate, since some Shia thought that Imamate was fixed for Muhammad and he was the Imam, as he was elder to Imam Hasan Askari . They thought in the same way with regard to the Imamate of Ismail bin Ja’far and Imam Musa Kadhim not being the Imam. Hence when Muhammad died, the command of Allah was revealed about him; that is he is not the Imam and that he is not appointed to Imamate, and the same was revealed with regard to Ismail previously. Not that previously a text based on his Imamate was mentioned and after that Allah changed His decision in favor of someone; as such a thing is impossible from Almighty Allah and He is aware of the end of all matters."

فيقول بعض المبتاعين: على ثلاثمائة دينار، فقد زادني العفاف فيها رغبة. فتقول له بالعربية: لو برزت في زي سليمان بن داود وعلى شبه ملكه ما بدت لي فيك رغبة، فاشفق على مالك. فيقول النخاس: فما الحيلة ولا بد من بيعك؟فتقول الجارية: وما العجلة؟ ولا بد من اختيار مبتاع يسكن قلبي إليه وإلى وفائه وأمانته. فعند ذلك قم إلى عمر بن يزيد النخاس وقل له إن معك كتابا ملصقا لبعض الأشراف كتبه بلغة رومية وخط رومي، ووصف فيه كرمه ووفاءه ونبله وسخاءه. فناولها لتتأمل منه أخلاق صاحبه، فإن مالت إليه ورضيته فأنا وكيله في ابتياعها منك. قال بشر بن سليمان: فامتثلت جميع ما حده لي مولاي أبو الحسن عليه السلام في أمر الجارية، فلما نظرت في الكتاب بكت بكاء شديدا وقالت لعمر بن يزيد: بعني! من صاحب هذا الكتاب؟وحلفت بالمحرجة والمغلظة أنه متى امتنع من بيعها منه قتلت نفسها. فما زلت أشاحه في ثمنها حتى استقر الأمر فيه على مقدار ما كان أصحبنيه مولاي عليه السلام من الدنانير، فاستوفاه مني وتسلمت الجارية ضاحكة مستبشرة،وانصرفت بها إلى الحجيرة التي كنت آوي إليها ببغداد. فما أخذها القرار حتى أخرجت كتاب مولانا عليه السلام من جيبها وهي تلثمه وتطبقه على جفنها وتضعه على خدها وتمسحه على بدنها.فقلت تعجبا منها: تلثمين كتابا لا تعرفين صاحبه؟ فقالت: أيها العاجز الضعيف المعرفة بمحل أولاد الأنبياء! أعرني سمعك وفرغ لي قلبك. أنا ملكية بنت يشوعا بن قيصر ملك الروم،وأمي من ولد الحواريين تنسب إلى وصي المسيح شمعون. أنبئك بالعجب: إن جدي قيصر أراد أن يزوجني من ابن أخيه وأنا من بنات ثلاث عشرة سنة، فجمع في قصره من نسل الحواريين من القسيسين والرهبان ثلاثمائة رجل ومن ذوي الأخطار منهم سبعمائة رجل، وجمع من أمراء الأجناد وقواد العسكر ونقباء الجيوش وملوك العشائر أربعة آلاف،وأبرز من بهي ملكه عرشا مصنوعا من أصناف الجوهر إلى صحن القصر ورفعه فوق أربعين مرقاة. فلما صعد ابن أخيه وأحدقت الصلب وقامت الأساقفة عكفا ونشرت أسفار الإنجيل تسافلت الصلب من الأعلى فلصقت بالأرض وتقوضت أعمدة العرش فانهارت إلى القرار وخر الصاعد من العرش مغشيا عليه، فتغيرت ألوان الأساقفة وارتعدت فرائصهم، فقال كبيرهم لجدي: أيها الملك، أعفنا من ملاقاة هذه النحوس الدالة على زوال دولة هذا الدين المسيحي والمذهب الملكاني. فتطير جدي من ذلك تطيرا شديدا وقال للأساقفة: أقيموا هذه الأعمدة وارفعوا الصلبان وأحضروا أخا هذا المدبر العاثر المنكوس جده لأزوجه هذه الصبية فيدفع نحوسه عنكم بسعوده. فلما فعلوا ذلك حدث على الثاني مثل ما حدث على الأول وتفرق الناس. وقـام جـدي قيـصر مغتمـا فدخـل منـزل النسـاء وأرخيـت الستـور. وأريـت في تلك الليلة كأن المسيح وشمعون وعدة من الحواريين قد اجتمعوا في قصر جدي ونصبوا فيه منبرا من نور يباري السماء علوا وارتفاعا في الموضع الذي كان نصب جدي فيه عرشه، ودخل عليهم محمد صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم وختنه ووصيه وعدة من أبنائه عليهم السلام.فتقدم المسيح إليه فاعتنقه،فيقول له محمد صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم: يا روح الله، إني جئتك خاطبا من وصيك شمعون فتاته مليكة لابني هذا. وأومأ بيده إلى أبي محمد عليه السلام ابن صاحب هذا الكتاب. فنظر المسيح إلى شمعون وقال له: قد أتاك الشرف! فصل رحمك رحم آل محمد عليهم السلام. قال: قد فعلت.فصعد ذلك المنبر فخطب محمد صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم وزوجني من ابنه، وشهد المسيح عليه السلام وشهد أبناء محمد عليهم السلام والحواريون. فلما استيقظت أشفقت أن أقص هذه الرؤيا على أبي وجدي مخافة القتل، فكنت أسرها ولا أبديها لهم. وضرب صدري بمحبة أبي محمد عليه السلام حتى امتنعت من الطعام والشراب، فضعفت نفسي ودق شخصي ومرضت مرضا شديدا،فما بقي في مدائن الروم طبيب إلا أحضره جدي وسأله عن دوائي. فلما برح به اليأس قال: يا قرة عيني، وهل يخطر ببالك شهوة فأزودكها في هذه الدنيا؟ فقلت: يا جدي،أرى أبواب الفرج علي مغلقة. فلو كشفت العذاب عمن في سجنك من أسارى المسلمين وفككت عنهم الأغلال وتصدقت عليهم ومنيتهم الخلاص رجوت أن يهب لي المسيح وأمه عافية. فلما فعل ذلك تجلدت في إظهار الصحة من بدني قليلا وتناولت يسيرا من الطعام،فسر بذلك وأقبل على إكرام الأسارى وإعزازهم. فأريت أيضا بعد أربع عشرة ليلة كأن سيدة نساء العالمين فاطمة عليها السلام قد زارتني ومعها مريم ابنة عمران وألف من وصائف الجنان، فتقول لي مريم: هذه سيدة نساء العالمين أم زوجك أبي محمد. فأتعلق بها وأبكي وأشكو إليها امتناع أبي محمد عليه السلام من زيارتي. فقالت سيدة النساء عليها السلام: إن ابني أبا محمد لا يزورك وأنت مشركة بالله على مذهب النصارى. وهذه أختي مريم بنت عمران تبرأ إلى الله تعالى من دينك. فإن ملت إلى رضى الله ورضى المسيح ومريم عليهما السلام وزيارة أبي محمد إياك فقولي: أشهد أن لا إله إلا الله وأن أبي محمدا رسول الله. فلما تكلمت بهذه الكلمة ضمتني إلى صدرها سيدة نساء العالمين عليها السلام وطيبت نفسي وقالت: الآن توقعي زيارة أبي محمد، فإني منفذته إليك. فانتبهت وأنا أنول وأتوقع لقاء أبي محمد عليه السلام. فلما كان في الليلة القابلة رأيت أبا محمد عليه السلام وكأني أقول له: جفوتني يا حبيبي بعد أن أتلفت نفسي معالجة حبك. فقال: ما كان تأخري عنك إلا لشركك، فقد أسلمت وأنا زائرك في كل ليلة إلى أن يجمع الله تعالى شملنا في العيان. فما قطع عني زيارته بعد ذلك إلى هذه الغاية. قال بشر: فقلت لها: وكيف وقعت في الأسارى؟ فقالت: أخبرني أبو محمد عليه السلام ليلة من الليالي أن جدك سيسير جيشا إلى قتال المسلمين يوم كذا وكذا ثم يتبعهم، فعليك باللحاق بهم متنكرة في زي الخدم مع عدة من الوصائف من طريق كذا. ففعلت ذلك فوقعت علينا طلائع المسلمين حتى كان من أمري ما رأيت وشاهدت، وما شعر بأني ابنة ملك الروم إلى هذه الغاية أحد سواك، وذلك باطلاعي إياك عليه. ولقد سألني الشيخ الذي وقعت إليه في سهم الغنيمة عن اسمي فأنكرته وقلت: نرجس. فقال: اسم الجواري. قلت: العجب إنك رومية ولسانك عربي؟!قالت: نعم، من ولوع جدي وحمله إياي على تعلم الآداب أن أوعز إلى امرأة ترجمانة لي في الاختلاف إلي. وكانت تقصدني صباحا ومساء وتفيدني العربية حتى استمر لساني عليها واستقام. قال بشر: فلما انكفأت بها إلى سر من رأى دخلت على مولاي أبي الحسن عليه السلام،فقال: كيف أراك الله عز الإسلام وذل النصرانية وشرف محمد وأهل بيته عليهم السلام؟ قالت: كيف أصف لك يا ابن رسول الله ما أنت أعلم به مني؟ قال: فإني أحببت أن أكرمك. فما أحب إليك؛ عشرة آلاف دينار أم بشرى لك بشرف الأبد؟ قالت: بشرى بولد لي.قال لها: أبشري بولد يملك الدنيا شرقا وغربا ويملأ الأرض قسطاً وعدلاً كما ملئت ظلماً وجوراً. قالت: ممن؟ قال: ممن خطبك رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم له ليلة كذا في شهر كذا من سنة كذا بالرومية. قالت: من المسيح ووصيه؟ قال لها: ممن زوجك المسيح عليه السلام ووصيه. قالت: من ابنك أبي محمد عليه السلام؟ فقال: هل تعرفينه؟ قالت: وهل خلت ليلة لم يرني فيها منذ الليلة التي أسلمت على يد سيدة النساء عليها السلام؟ قال: فقال مولانا: يا كافور، ادع أختي حكيمة. فلما دخلت قال لها: ها هيه. فاعتنقتها طويلا وسرت بها كثيرا. فقال لها أبو الحسن عليه السلام: يا بنت رسول الله، خذيها إلى منزلك وعلميها الفرائض والسنن، فإنها زوجة أبي محمد وأم القائم عليه السلام.,"H 178 - A group of scholars has narrated from Abu Mufaddal Shaibani from Muhammad bin Bahr bin Sahl Shaibani that he said: Bushr bin Sulaiman, Nakhkhas, a slave trader from the descendents of Abu Ayyub Ansari and a sincere Shia of Imams Ali Naqi and Hasan Askari and their neighbor at Samarrah said: “One day Kafur, the slave of Imam Ali Naqi came to me and summoned me to his master. When I went to the Imam, he said: “O Bushr, you are from the descendents of Ansar. This devotion is your legacy, which your each coming generation inherits from the preceding. You are trustworthy men of us, Ahle Bayt. I am elevating you and ennobling you by an excellence, through which you will surpass all Shia in devotion, by sharing a secret with you and sending you to purchase a certain slave girl.” He then wrote a very fine letter in Roman script and language; and imprinted his seal on it. He took out a yellow cloth containing two hundred and twenty dinars. He said: “Take this and go to Baghdad.” He told me to go to the crossing of the Euphrates on the noon of such and such day. He said: “When you reach the boats of the captives, you will see slave girls in them. You will find buyers working for the procurers of Abbasids and a small group of Arab youths. When you see that, keep an eye on a man called Amr bin Zaid, the slave trader from a distance all day long, until a slave girl is brought to the buyers, who has such-and-such quality. Her dress is two thick silks; she refuses to be seen or touched by the examiners; she does not submit to anyone who would want to touch her. And you will hear a cry in Roman from behind a thin veil. You should know that she is saying: Alas from the violation of the veil. One of the buyers of Amr will say: Mine for three hundred dinars; her modesty has ever increased my desire for her. She replies to him in Arabic: Even if you come in the form of Sulaiman, the son of Dawood and with a kingdom like his, I will not be interested in you. So, save your money. “The slave-dealer says: Then what is the solution? I have to sell you. The slave girl replies: Why the haste? There must be a buyer that my heart finds rest in; in his fidelity and honesty. At that moment, go to Amr bin Zaid and tell him you have a nice letter from a certain man of nobility, which he has written in Roman language and Roman script, describing therein his benevolence, fidelity, excellence and generosity, so that she may discern from it the character of its author. Should she be interested in him and choose him, then I am his representative in buying her from you.” Bushr bin Sulaiman says: I performed all that which my Master, Abul Hasan had ordered me to do with respect to the slave girl. When she saw the epistle, she cried very profusely and said to Amr bin Zaid: Sell me to the author of this letter. She took the solemnest of oaths that should he refuse, she will take her life. I negotiated the price with the dealer until it settled exactly on the amount my Master had given me. The money being sufficient, I took the slave girl, who was so very happy and in laughter. I returned with her to the quarters I was residing at in Baghdad. She was very restless until she took out from her pocket the letter of our Imam. She would kiss it and put it on her eyes and place it on her cheeks and touch it to her body. Astonished by this, I said: You are kissing a letter you don’t know who wrote. “O incapable and feeble one from knowing the position of the progeny of prophets,” she said, “Lend me your ears and vacate your heart for my words. I am Malika, the daughter of Yashua, son of the Caesar of Rome. My mother is a descendent of the Disciples of Isa (Hawariyin), and her lineage goes back to Shamun, the successor of Isa. I will narrate to you the wondrous story. My grandfather, the Caesar, wanted to marry me to his nephew when I was a girl of thirteen. So he gathered in his palace, three hundred priests and monks from the descendents of Hawariyin, and from their men of stature seven hundred men. He gathered four thousand commanders of the army and officers of military, leaders of armed forces and chiefs of tribes. He erected a throne from the dearest of his riches, which was adorned with varieties of jewels and raised over forty steps. When his nephew climbed, the crosses were fixed about, the bishops took their stands in great reverence, and the pages of Injeel were opened. Suddenly the crosses collapsed from the top and hit the ground. The pillars of the throne crumbled and crashed to the floor. My grandfather’s nephew, who had risen over the throne, fell down unconscious. The faces of the bishops paled and their chests trembled. Their leader said to my grandfather, ‘Please excuse me from facing this evil, which forebodes the demise of this Christian religion and the royal creed.’ “My grandfather took this as an evil omen and said to them, ‘Erect these scaffolds and raise the crosses and bring the brother of this deceased man, whose dreams have been ruined, so I may marry him this young girl; so the evil of his dead brother may go away through his fortune.’ “And when they did that, the same thing happened to the second as had happened to the first nephew. People dispersed. My grandfather, the Caesar stood in great distress and entered the quarters of the womenfolk. I dropped the curtains and in the same night saw in my dream that Isa, Shamun, and a number of the Disciples (Hawariyin) had gathered at my grandfather’s palace. They had installed there a pulpit of light that was defying heavens in height and elevation. It was in the same spot where my grandfather had installed his throne. At this, Muhammad, (s), his son-in-law and his successor, Amirul Momineen and a number of his sons entered. Isa went forward and embraced him. Muhammad said to him, ‘O Ruhallah, I have come to you to propose to your successor, Shamun for his daughter, Malika for this son of my mine, pointing to Imam Hasan Askari , the son of the writer of this epistle. Isa looked at Shamun and said, ‘The greatest honor has come to you. Let your relation be bonded with the relation of Aale Muhammad .’ ‘Shamun said: ‘It will be my honor to do so.’ He climbed over that pulpit. Muhammad (s) performed the rituals and married me to his son. Isa bore witness and the sons of Muhammad and the Hawariyin bore witness. When I woke up, I was scared to report this to my father or grandfather, fearing they would kill me. I kept this secret and did not reveal it to them. Meanwhile, my heart throbbed with love for Imam Hasan Askari so much that I forsook eating and drinking. I became weak and my body grew lean and I became very sick. There was no physician left in the cities of Rome that my grandfather did not bring to heal me. When despair overwhelmed him, he said to me, ‘O solace of my heart, does any wish occur to your heart in this world, so I may fulfill it?’ “I said: ‘Grandfather, I see the doors of relief shut on me. However, if you save the Muslim captives in your prison from torture, remove their chains, do them favors and release them kindly, I am hopeful that Isa and his mother will give me health.’ When he did that, I made effort to display health and ate a little food. This made him very happy and he became ever intense to confer kindness and respect upon the captives. “I also saw in my dreams for fourteen nights the Mistress of the Women of the Worlds, Fatima . She visited me along with Maryam, daughter of Imran, and one thousand Houries from Paradise. Maryam says to me, ‘This is the Mistress of the Ladies , the mother of your husband.’ So I hold her and cry and complain why Imam Hasan Askari does not come to visit me. The Mistress of the Ladies said: ‘My son, Imam Hasan Askari will not visit you as long as you believe in a partner with Allah in the religion of the Christians. This is my sister Maryam, the daughter of Imran, and she turns to Allah with disdain from your religion. If you want the pleasure of Allah, the Exalted, and the pleasure of Isa and his mother, and to have Imam Hasan Askari visit you, say: I testify that there is no god, except Allah and Muhammad is the Last Messenger of Allah.’ “When I spoke these words, the Mistress of the Ladies of the World pulled me to her chest and my soul was blessed. She said: ‘Now expect the visitations of Imam Hasan Askari . I am sending him to you.’ I woke up in great excitement and expectation of meeting the Imam. The following night, I saw Imam and as if I was saying to him, ‘You abandoned me, my beloved, while the remedy of your love ruined my soul.’ He said: ‘My delay was not but for your polytheistic belief. Now you have embraced Islam, I am going to visit you every night until Allah brings us together.’ Until now, his visitations to me have not ceased.” Bushr bin Sulaiman says: I asked her, “How did you fall amongst the captives?” She said: “Imam Hasan Askari told me on one of the nights: Your grandfather will shortly be dispatching an army to fight the Muslims on such and such day, and he will follow them. You have to join them in the train of servants along with a number of servants from such and such route. I did that and the vanguards of Muslims encountered us, which led to my situation that you see. And no one knew that I am the granddaughter of the Roman Caesar until now, except you and that is because I told you. The gentleman in whose share of booty I fell, asked me of my name. I hid my identity from him and said: ‘Narjis.’ He said: ‘A name of slave girl.’ I said to her, “It is amazing that you are Roman and your language is Arabic.” She said: “Due to my grandfather’s persistence and encouragement that I should increase my learning, he appointed a woman to me, who was his interpreter, to visit me. She would come to me day and night and teach me Arabic, until I became fluent.” Bushr says: When I brought her back to Samarrah, I came to my Master, Imam Ali Naqi . He asked her, “How did Allah show you the glory of Islam and the disgrace of Christianity and the nobility of Muhammad and his Household?” She said: “How would I describe, O son of Allah’s Messenger, something, which you know better than me?” “I would like to confer kindness on you,” he said. “Which one is dearer to you, ten thousand dinars or a happy tiding of eternal grandeur?” “Happy tidings of a son for me,” she said. “Rejoice the tidings of having a son, who would rule the world, from the east to the west, and fill it with equity and justice, as it will be fraught with oppression and injustice.” “From whom,” she asked. From the one for whom the Messenger of Allah (s) proposed for you on such and such night, in such and such year, replied my Master in Roman. He said: “To whom Isa and his successor married you.” “From your son?” she asked. “Do you know him?” “Has there been a night he has not visited me since I have embraced Islam at the hands of Mistress of the Ladies!” Imam Ali Naqi said: “Kafur, call my sister Hakima.” And when she entered, he said, “Here she is.” Lady Hakima embraced her long and was very much happy to see her. Imam Ali Naqi said, “O daughter of the Messenger of Allah, take her to your house and teach her the duties and traditions, for she is the wife of my son and the mother of Qaim .”"

(قال) وكان يركب إلى دار الخلافة بسر من رأى في كل إثنين وخميس. (قال) وكان يوم النوبة يحضر من الناس شيء عظيم ويغص الشارع بالدواب والبغال والحمير والضجة فلا يكون لأحد موضع يمشي ولا يدخل بينهم.(قال) فإذا جاء أستاذي سكنت الضجة وهدأ صهيل الخيل ونهاق الحمير. (قال) وتفرقت البهائم حتى يصير الطريق واسعا لا يحتاج أن يتوقى من الدواب تحفه ليزحمها. ثم يدخل فيجلس في مرتبته التي جعلت له. فإذا أراد الخروج وصاح البوابون: هاتوا دابة أبي محمد، سكن صياح الناس وصهيل الخيل،فتفرقت الدواب حتى يركب ويمضي. وقال الشاكري: واستدعاه يوما الخليفة وشق ذلك عليه وخاف أن يكون قد سعى به إليه بعض من يحسده على مرتبته من العلويين والهاشميين، فركب ومضى إليه. فلما حصل في الدار قيل له: إن الخليفة قد قام. ولكن اجلس في مرتبتك أو انصرف. (قـال) فانصـرف وجـاء إلى سوق الدواب وفيها من الضجة والمصادمة واختلاف الناس شيء كثير. فلما دخل إليها سكن الناس وهدأت الدواب. (قال) وجلس إلى نخاس كان يشتري له الدواب. (قال) فجيء له بفرس كبوس لا يقدر أحد أن يدنو منه. (قال) فباعوه إياه بوكس، فقال لي: يا محمد،قم فاطرح السرج عليه. (قال) فقلت: إنه لا يقول لي ما يؤذيني. فحللت الحزام وطرحت السرج عليه،فهدأ ولم يتحرك. وجئت به لأمضي به، فجاء النخاس فقال لي: ليس يباع. فقال لي: سلمه إليهم. قال: فجاء النخاس ليأخذه، فالتفت إليه التفاتة ذهب منه منهزما. (قال) وركب ومضينا، فلحقنا النخاس فقال: صاحبه يقول أشفقت أن يرد،فإن كان قد علم ما فيه من الكبس فليشتره. فقال لي أستاذي: قد علمت. فقال: قد بعتك. فقال لي: خذه. فأخذته. (قال) فجئت به إلى الإصطبل،فما تحرك ولا آذاني ببركة أستاذي.فلما نزل جاء إليه وأخذ أذنه اليمنى فرقاه ثم أخذ أذنه اليسرى فرقاه. فوالله لقد كنت أطرح الشعير له فأفرقه بين يديه فلا يتحرك. هذا ببركة أستاذي. قال أبو محمد: قال أبو علي بن همام: هذا الفرس يقال له الصئول. (قال) يرجم بصاحبه حتى يرجم به الحيطان ويقوم على رجليه ويلطم صاحبه. قال محمد الشاكري: كان أستاذي أصلح من رأيت من العلويين والهاشميين. ما كان يشرب هذا النبيذ. كان يجلس في المحراب ويسجد فأنام وانتبه وأنام وهو ساجد، وكان قليل الأكل. كان يحضره التين والعنب والخوخ وما شاكله فيأكل منه الواحدة والثنتين ويقول: شل هذا يا محمد إلى صبيانك. فأقول: هذا كله؟ فيقول: خذه. ما رأيت قط أسدى منه. فهذه بعض دلائله، ولو استوفيناها لطال به الكتاب. وكان مع إمامته من أكرم الناس وأجودهم.,"H 179 - A group of scholars has informed us from Abu Muhammad Harun bin Musa Talakbari that he said: I was in the parlor of Abu Ali Muhammad bin Himam seated on a bench, when an aged man with a cloak on shoulders came to us. He greeted Abu Ali bin Himam and he replied to his greeting as he passed on. Abu Ali asked me: Do you know who that is? No, I replied. This man is the servant of our master, Abu Muhammad . Would you like to hear his traditions from Imam ? Yes, I replied. He said: Do you have anything to give him? I said: I have two dirhams from legal tender. He replied: That is enough. So I followed him till I reached him. I said: Abu Ali asks you if can return to us? He replied: Yes. So we came together to Abu Ali bin Himam. Abu Ali signaled me to give those two dirhams to him and I gave him the money. That old man said: There was no need of this. After that he took the money. Abu Ali bin Himam said: O Aba Abdullah Muhammad please narrated to us what you saw about Imam Hasan Askari . He said: My teacher is such a righteous person among the Alawites and I have definitely not seen anyone like him. He mounted a horse, which had black brocade saddle; he mounted his horse Mondays and Thursday and went to the capital at Surre Man Ra. One day when it was his turn to go, a lot of people were present on way to the palace and the lanes and roads were crowded with horses, mules etc. and there was a complete traffic jam. In such a way that no one can move forward. Due to the crowd there was no possibility to enter. But when my master arrived, all the people and animals became silent and animals moved to the side and made way in such a way that there was no need of taking precaution of touching the animals. After that he entered the gathering and sat down at the place reserved for him. Even at the time when he wanted to leave Darul Khilafa he called the gate keepers: Bring the mount of Abu Muhammad [Imam Hasan Askari ]; again the people and animals became silent and the animals made way to allow the Imam to mount and depart from there. One day the Caliph summoned the Imam and it was disturbing to him and he feared jealousy, slander and tale telling of some Alawites and Hashimites against him with the Caliph. He mounted the horse and departed. When he came to the house of the Caliph, he was told that the Caliph has left his seat and gone away; if you like you may wait for him or return. He returned from there and came to the cattle market. The market was noisy and busy, but when he entered the place even the animals fell silent. The Imam sat down with his agent who used to transact on his behalf. Meanwhile they came and sold a refractory horse to him at a very cheap rate. The Imam said to me: O Muhammad, get up and place the saddle on it. I arose and said to myself: He never orders me to do something that is painful. So I untied the waist band below the belly of the horse and placed the saddle on it. The horse remained quiet and made no movement. When I wanted to take the horse, the agent thought that it has become tame, so he said: It is not for sale. The Imam told me: Give the horse to him. The agent came to take the horse, but as soon as the horse saw him, it fled in fear. The Imam mounted his own horse and set out from there. The agent came to us and said: The owner of the horse says: I fear its return, because if your master knows that it is wild and refractory, he may buy it. The Imam said to me: Give him the money. I understood, the agent said: I have sold it. The Imam said to me: Take the horse. I took it up and took it to the stable; and the horse also, through the blessing of my master [Imam Hasan Askari ] did not agitate or trouble me. When the Imam dismounted, he held the right ear of the horse and recited something in it and then held the left ear and recited something in that as well. I swear by God, he became so tame that even when I cast grain before him, he just fed on his nourishment without any untoward behavior and it was due to the blessing of my master. Abu Muhammad has narrated from Abu Ali bin Himam that this horse was so wild that it was named as Saul; that is a beast, which kills people and throws down its owner, hits him against the wall and injures him by trampling him under the hooves. Muhammad, the servant says: My master was the most devout among the Alawites. He never consumed grape extract [wine] and remained seated in his place of worship and performed prostration. I used to sleep, wake up and again go back to sleep. He was still in his prostration. The Imam ate very less. Figs, grapes, peach and other kinds of fruits were brought for him, but he took one or two of them and said: O Muhammad, take it for your children. I asked: All? He replied: Take all. I have not seen anyone better than him. This brief sketch was among the proofs and miracles of Imam Hasan Askari and if we wanted to mention all of them, it would have prolonged the book. In addition to Imamate, His Eminence was the most noble and kind person of his time."

When he returned from Hajj, he wrote a letter to the Imam [apparently to object to so much generosity].

Immediately, he mounted a horse and moved towards Darul Khilafa. Then He came back hurriedly, accompanied by five reliable servants of the master of faithful. One of them was Nahrir. He ordered the servants to keep a vigil on the house of Hasan bin Ali and gather information about him from time to time. He called a group of physicians and asked them to visit him regularly. After two days, a person informed that Imam became very weak. My father started out to meet him and stayed with him till morning and then ordered his servants to stay with him. Then he called the chief justice and ordered him to select ten such persons from the community, who were known for their honesty and trustworthiness. The selected persons were thus sent to the house of (Imam) Hasan. They were ordered to stay there day and night till his demise. After a few days of the month of Rabi I, 260 A.H. passed away, the news spread in entire Samarrah that Ibn Ridha has passed away. Then he made preparations for the rites of Imam. He closed all the markets. My father, people of Bani Hashim, soldiers, secretaries and other people attended his funeral. The caliph asked Abu Isa Ibn Mutawakkil to offer the funeral prayer. The coffin was prepared and Abu Isa moved near it and removed the cloth off the face of Imam and addressed the people, “This is Hasan bin Ali bin Muhammad bin Ridha, who died a natural death and the servants of the master of faithful, and so-and-so judges are witness to it. Then he covered his face and stood up to offer the funeral prayer. He recited five Takbirs and the bier was ordered to be lifted. The bier was taken from his house and the Imam was buried near the grave of his father."

I put on my garments and left at once and reached him at his house. He was sitting in the yard and his concubines were about him. I said: “May I be your ransom, O my Master, from whom would the successor be born?” He said: “From Susan.” I ran my eyes over them and did not see any girl with any sign of pregnancy, except Susan. After I prayed the Isha prayers, I brought the meal and Susan and I ended the fast. Arranging her and myself in one room, I fell asleep for a short while and then woke up. I was constantly thinking about the promise of Imam Hasan Askari with regard to the Wali of Allah. I got up before the regular time I would wake up every night for prayers. I performed the midnight prayers and when I reached the Watr prayers (last part), Susan rose suddenly and went out and made her ablution with great attention and piety. Then she came back and prayed the midnight prayers and reached Watr. It occurred to me that dawn has neared and I rose up to check it. The first dawn had risen. Doubts entered my heart with regard to the promise of Imam Hasan Askari . He called me from his room, “Aunt, do not have doubts. It is almost as if you are witnessing the event at this hour and seeing him, God willing.” Lady Hakima says: I felt embarrassed from Imam Hasan Askari , because of the doubts that had occurred to me. I returned to the room feeling ashamed. Suddenly Susan finished her prayers and came out frightened. I met her at the door and said: “My parents be your ransom, do you feel anything?” She said: “Yes, O aunt. I feel a great happening.” I said to her, “May you have no fears, if Allah wills.” I took a pillow and threw it at the center of the room and sat her on it. I sat in a position with respect to her in which a woman sits with another for the purpose of delivery. She seized my hand and squeezed it very hard. Then she groaned once and recited Kalimah. I looked beneath her, and there I was in the presence of the Wali of Allah, bliss of Allah be for him, who was touching the earth with his forehead, palms of hands, knees, and toes. I held him from his shoulders and sat him on my lap. He was clean and without any need of any attention. Imam Hasan Askari called, “O aunt, bring my son to me.” I carried him to his father, who took him and brought out his tongue and touched it against the eyes of the baby, who opened his eyes. He then put his tongue into the blessed baby’s mouth that sucked on it. He then put it into his ears. He sat him on his right palm. The Wali of Allah sat straight. Imam Hasan Askari touched his head and said, “My dear son, speak with the power of Allah.” The Wali of Allah sought refuge of Allah from the cursed Satan and began: “In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. And We desired to bestow a favor upon those who were deemed weak in the land, and to make them the Imams, and to make them the heirs. And to grant them power in the land, and to make Firon and Haman and their hosts see from them what they feared.” (28:5-6) And may Allah bless His Messenger and Amirul Momineen .” He mentioned the Imams one after the other until he reached his father. Then Imam Hasan Askari gave him to me and said: “O Aunt, return him to his mother, so her heart may rejoice and may she grieve not and that she may know that the promise of Allah is true, but the majority of the people do not know.” I returned him to his mother while the second dawn had brightened. I performed the Morning (Fajr) prayers and then said my post prayers devotions until sunrise. I bid Imam Hasan Askari farewell and returned to my house. After three days passed, I became anxious to see the Wali of Allah. I went to them and started with the room where Susan was. I did not see any trace, nor heard any mention. I did not want to ask, so I came to Imam Hasan Askari . I felt bashful to begin the conversation with him by asking him. So, he began and said: “Aunt, he is in the protection of Allah, His safeguard, His curtain and His eye, until Allah gives him permission. So when Allah hides my person and transfers me, and you see my Shia disputing, inform the reliable ones of them. This must remain with you and them as a secret, for Allah hides His Wali. Allah hides him from His creation and veils him from His servants. No one will see him until Jibraeel offers him his mount, in order that Allah may fulfill the enterprise that must be fulfilled.”"

He opened his eyes and began laughing and calling me with his finger. I held him and brought him near my mouth to kiss. I smelt such a fragrance from him that I had never smelt a better one. Imam Hasan Askari called, ‘Aunt, come and bring my young man to me.’ I took him to his father.

On his right forearm it was written: “The truth has come and the falsehood has vanished; surely falsehood is a vanishing (thing).” (17:81) I pulled him to myself and found him pure and clean. He did not need any sort of attention. I wrapped him in a sheet and carried him to Imam Hasan Askari .

He prayed for the relief of his devotees at his hands. Then he stopped. She says: “Then something like a veil was erected between me and Imam Hasan Askari and I did not see my Master.

He was walking about the house. I had never seen a face more beautiful than his, nor heard any tongue more eloquent than his. Imam Hasan Askari said: “This is the baby who is dignified before Allah, the Glorified.” I said: “My Master, I see him in this condition and he is only forty days old.” He smiled and said: “My aunt, don’t you know that we Imams grow in a day to the extent that others grow in a year.” I arose and kissed his forehead and returned. Then I came back and sought him, but did not see him. I asked Imam Hasan Askari , “What have you done to our Master?” He said: “Aunt, we have entrusted him to the one mother of Musa entrusted.”"

He was my friend and would express his affection to me, as it is in the spirit of the people of Iraq. He would say every time he met me, “I have news for you to rejoice, but I will not give it to you.” I would pretend to care less until one day we were brought together at a secluded spot. With much fervor, I asked him to tell me about what news he had. He said: Our houses were at Samarrah, facing the house of Ibn Ridha, (meaning the house of Imam Hasan Askari . For a very long time, I stayed away from the locality, going to Qazwin and other cities. Then destiny brought me back to Samarrah. When I returned, I saw that I had lost all whom I had left behind from my family and relatives, except an old woman who had raised me and she had a daughter. She was of the original disposition, veiling, protective and did not know lying. Also there were some of our cousins who had stayed at the house. I stayed with them for some days and then decided to leave. The old woman said: “Why do you make haste to return after such a long absence? Stay with us, so we may take the pleasure of your stay.” I said to her in jest, “I want to go to Kerbala.” This was a season when great many people were leaving either for mid-Shaban or the day of Arafa. “I seek refuge of Allah for you, my son, to blaspheme through this talk of ridicule.” She said: “I am going to tell you what I have seen. This happened two years after you left us. I was in this house, sleeping near the main entry hall. My daughter was with me. I was in a condition somewhere between sleep and wakefulness, when entered a man of handsome face, clean clothes, fragrant smell and said: So and so, someone will come at this hour to you to call you to your neighbor. Do not refuse to go with him and don’t be scared. I was afraid and called out to my daughter, ‘Did you notice someone entering the house?’ She said: ‘No.’ I called Allah to my heart and recited some verses and went to sleep. The same man came again and repeated what he had said earlier. I cried out to my daughter. She said: ‘No one came. Remember Allah and don’t be scared.’ I recited some verses and went to sleep again. Then it happened the third time; the man came and said: So and so, the one who is calling you is here and is knocking the door. Go with him.’ I heard the knock and went to the door. ‘Who is this?’ I asked. ‘Open and fear not,’ someone said. I recognized his word and opened the door. It was a servant in a lower garment sheet on him. He said: ‘A neighbor needs you for a very important matter. Please come.’ He covered my head with the sheet and took me to the house, which I knew. There were sets of curtains fixed in the middle. A man was seated on the side of the curtains. The servant gestured to me with his eye and I entered. There was a woman in labor and another lady was behind her as if she was delivering her. The woman asked: ‘Would you help us in this?’ I helped them in the delivery. It was but a moment that a boy was born. I held him and shouted, ‘It is a boy! It is a boy!’ I put my head out from the side of the curtains to give glad tiding to the man seated there. ‘Don’t shout,’ someone said. When I returned inside, the boy was not in my hands. The woman who was seated told me, ‘Don’t shout.’ The servant took my hand and wrapped my head with the sheet and took me out of the house. He took me to my house and gave me a bag and said: ‘Don’t tell anyone of what you saw.’ I entered the house and returned to my bed. My daughter was still sleeping. Waking her up, I asked, ‘Did you see me going out and coming back?’ She replied: ‘No.’ I opened the bag at that hour and there were ten dinars in it. I have not told this to anyone until today when you spoke these words derisively. I narrated this to you to commiserate over you, for these people (Ahle Bayt) have a lofty status and high position before Allah, the Glorified, and everything they pray for is fulfilled.” I was astonished by her narrative, but passed on with ridicule and jest. I did not ask her of its time; however, I know for sure that I had left them in two hundred and fifty and some odd year and returned to Samarrah in two hundred and eighty-one. The time when the old woman narrated this to me was during the ministry of Ubaidullah bin Sulaiman."

Ahmad Ibn Ishaq made a gesture to me to ask him about the successor. So, I asked him, “O Abu Amr, I want to ask you a question; however, I am not unsure about what I want to ask you, for my faith and my belief is that the earth does not remain without a Divine Proof (Hujjah), unless it is forty days prior to Judgment Day. And when that happens, the Divine Proof (Hujjah) is raised up and the door of repentance is shut. And it will not benefit any soul has it not already believed and earned good in its belief. They are the wicked of God’s creation and they are the ones that Judgment Day shall stand against them. However, I desire to increase my certitude, as Ibrahim asked his Lord to show him how He brings the dead back to life. He said: ‘Do you believe not? He said: Indeed; rather, for my heart to satisfy. Abu Ali Ahmad Ibn Ishaq has narrated to me from Abul Hasan . He said: I asked the Imam, ‘With whom should I transact and from whom should I learn and whose word should I accept?’ The Imam said to him, Amari is my trustworthy man. Whatever he delivers to you, he does so from me. And whatever he says to you, he does so from me. So listen to him and obey him, for he is a trustworthy and honest man.’ Also Abu Ali narrated to me that he asked Abu Muhammad Hasan Ibn Ali the same question and the Imam said, Amari and his son are two trustworthy men. Whatever they deliver to you, they deliver from me; and whatever they say to you, they say from me. Listen to them and obey them, for they are two trustworthy and honest men.’ These are the words of two Imams of the past about you.” Abu Amr fell into prostration and tears rolled from his eyes and then he said: “Ask.” I asked, “Have you seen the successor of Imam Hasan Askari ?” He said: “Yes, by Allah, and his neck is like this,” and he gestured. I said, “I have one more question.” He said: “Bring it forth.” I said: “His name?” He said: “That is forbidden to you to ask for. I am not saying this from myself, nor am I permitted to allow or disallow. Rather, this prohibition is from the Imam himself . The ruler’s impression is that Imam Hasan Askari passed away without leaving a son and that his bequeathals were divided and taken over by persons not entitled to them. He was patient on that. There is his household, wandering about and there is no one who has the courage to recognize them or offer them something. Should the name come out, search will be on. So fear God and hold back from that.”"

Kamil bin Ibrahim says: I said to myself: I will ask the Imam if only those who have the same beliefs as us will enter Paradise? He says: When I met the Imam, I saw that he was wearing a rich garment. I said to myself: The Wali of Allah and the proof of Allah is himself wearing such garments and prohibits us from them; and he also tells us to be equitable with our brothers in faith. As I was engrossed in these thoughts, the Imam said smiling and turned up his sleeve: O Kamil, look here. I found that below the rich garment was a coarse shirt that was in contact with his body. “See this coarse garment is for the Almighty Allah and the rich dress is for you people.” Thus I greeted him and sat down near a door across which a curtain hung. Just then a gust of wind moved the curtain away. I saw a four-year-old handsome boy, who called out: O Kamil bin Ibrahim. I began to tremble and automatically said: Here I am, O my master. The boy said: You have come to the Wali of Allah and proof of Allah with to ask if those who don’t have the same belief as us will enter Paradise. I said: By Allah, I wanted to ask this only. He said: If it is so, very few people will enter Paradise. No, by Allah, even the Haqqiya will enter Paradise. I asked: Who are Haqqiya? He replied: Who love Imam Ali and who swear by his right, but they don’t know what his rights and merits are. Then that boy was quiet for sometime and then said: You also wanted to ask about the belief of Mufawweza (extremists). So you should know that they are liars; and our hearts are abodes of divine intention and when Allah intends something, we are also ready for it. “And you do not please except that Allah please…” Then the curtain, which had moved away by the breeze, returned to its position and I did not dare move it away again. After that Imam Hasan Askari smiled at me and said: O Kamil, why are you sitting here. Your questions were answered by the one who will be the divine proof and the Imam after me. Kamil says: After that I came out from there and never saw him again."

You should besiege that house and apprehend anyone you see there and bring him to me.” Thus we reached Samarrah and made way to the house Motazid had specified. On the doorstep was a black servant spinning threads. We asked him who was present there. He replied: ‘The owner.’ By Allah, he did not stop us in any way. We entered the house as we had been ordered. The house was absolutely clean and there was a curtain in the front; so beautiful as we had never seen before, as if it was just made at that moment. There was no one in the house and we pulled the curtain aside. We saw a huge room with a stream of water and at the end of which was a mat, which seemed to be floating on the water. Upon the mat stood the most handsome man engrossed in prayers. He neither paid attention to us nor to our means. At that moment Ahmad bin Abdullah, from among us stepped in the water in order to enter the room, but he began to drown. He struggled with all his might to keep himself from drowning till we stretched our hands and pulled him out. He fell down unconscious for sometime. Then another member of our group also tried to step in water to enter the room and he also fell down in the same condition. I was shocked and awed. Then I addressed the owner of the house: I seek forgiveness for you in the court of Allah, by Allah I don’t know what the matter is and to whom we have come and indeed I beg Allah for forgiveness. However, he did not give any response to what I had said and did not come out of his condition. Due to this a terrible awe struck us and we came out of there. Motazid was waiting for us and had instructed the sentry that as soon as we returned, we should be taken to him immediately. We reached him in the middle of the night. He asked us about what had passed. We related to him everything in detail. He cried: Woe be unto you, did anyone see you before me? And did anyone else hear this from you? We said: No. He said: I am not the grandson of my grandfather – and he took a great oath – if I ever hear it, I shall cut off your heads. We also did not dare to relate this matter to anyone as long as Motazid was alive."

I had completed six rounds and was starting on the seventh, when I saw a young man on the right side of Kaaba and fragrance was coming from him. His awe had affected the people and they had surrounded him so that they may speak to him. I have not heard anyone speak in a more pleasant way nor seen anyone with a better demeanor. I went there so that I may also get a chance to speak to him, but the crowd pushed me back. I asked the people who he was. People said that he was the son of Allah’s Messenger, who comes here for one day every year to meet his special followers and to speak to them. I called out: My chief, I also want to speak to you, so that you may guide me. When he heard this, he threw some pebbles towards me, which I picked up. People asked: What did he throw to you? I said: Pebbles. But when I opened my fist, I saw that they were pieces of gold. I began to follow him till I joined him. He said: Now my proof is complete on you, the truth has become manifest and your blindness is gone. Do you know who I am? I said: No, by Allah. He said: I am the same Mahdi. I am the Qaim, who would fill the earth with justice and equity as it would be fraught with injustice and tyranny. Know that the earth is never without Divine Proof and people cannot remain on nature for more than the period Bani Israel remained in the Tiyah desert (for forty years).

When it was noon, I prayed the Noon Prayer at the earliest time and invited that gentleman for dinner. He accepted the invitation. After dinner, I asked him his name, his father’s name, nativity and profession etc. He replied: My name is Muhammad bin Ubaidullah, I am from Qom and I am in search of truth since the last thirty years. I have lived in various places during this period and spent around twenty years in Mecca and Medina and studied the traditional reports. In the 29th year, I circled the Kaaba and when I reached the Place of Ibrahim, I prayed there. After that I dozed a little bit and then I heard someone reciting a supplication that I had never heard before. I was startled to see that it was a young handsome man of medium height who was reading that Dua. Then he came out of the Haram and started Sayy. I followed him, because the Almighty Allah inspired me that he was the master of the age. When he completed the Sayy, he set out from there and I followed him; but as I neared him I was stopped by a tall black man who said: “What do you want?” I began to tremble in fear and halted in my steps and that gentleman disappeared. I stood there in bewilderment for a long time. At last I returned from there condemning my own self, that why I was cowed down by a black. I returned and prayed to the Almighty Allah: I invoke You in the name of Your Prophet, please don’t waste my efforts and show me that which will satisfy and me show him to me again. After some years, I visited the tomb of the Messenger of Allah (s). One day, I dozed sitting between his tomb and pulpit when someone shook my arm. When I opened my eyes, I saw that same black man. He asked: “How are you?” “All right, but I was angry at you.” “You should not have done that. I was commanded to scold you. You should thank Allah and be pleased that you have seen him; it is enough.” Then he mentioned one of my brothers in faith and asked how he was. “He is in Barqa.” “You are right.” Then he mentioned another friend of mine, who was a very pious man. “He is in Alexandria.” He asked about many of my friends and then asked about a stranger: “How was that Nakhfur?” “I don’t know him.” “Yes, how can you know him? He is Roman and the Almighty Allah will guide him and he will come from Constantine to render help.” Then he asked about another person and I again said that I had no clue who he was. “He is from the Hayyat area and he is a helper of my lord and master. Now you may tell your associates that we are hopeful that the Almighty Allah will take revenge from the oppressors and permit us to help the oppressed. I have just conveyed the same message to some of our associates. You must not worry much; continue to obey Allah and the time of reappearance is near, if Allah wills.” [Muhammad bin Ahmad bin Khalaf says:] I ordered my cashier to bring fifty dinars and requested the aged man to accept them. He said: Brother, Allah has made unlawful for me to take anything that I don’t need just as He made it lawful for me to accept from you that which I am in need of. I asked: Has anyone other than me from the companions of the king heard about your story? He replied: Yes, your brother, Ahmad bin Husain Hamadani, who is exiled to Azerbaijan. He heard it from me and with the hope that he would also see what I saw, sought permission to go for Hajj. He performed Hajj, but that same year he was killed at the hands of Zikruya bin Mahruya. We separated and I came back to the boundary. The following year I went to Hajj and met a man named Tahir in Medina. He was among the descendants of Husain, the younger [Imam Sajjad ]. It was said that he had some knowledge about this matter [of Imamate]. I went to look for him and befriend him, so that he becomes comfortable with me and is aware of the correctness of my belief. I requested him: O son of Allah’s Messenger, I adjure you through the rights of your purified forefathers, please bestow me with knowledge of this matter of [Master of the age ] and make me like yourself. As one about whom you are confident has testified to me and informed me that Qasim bin Abdullah bin Sulaiman bin Wahab intends to eliminate me for my religion [of Twelver Shia] and has instigated my killing a number of times, but Almighty Allah saved me from his clutches. Tahir said: O brother, conceal whatever you hear from me in these mountains; those who carry provisions in the darkness of the night to a place they know, see extraordinary things and have restrained us from search and investigation. So I left him and returned."

I was on the way when I missed the Morning Prayer. When I descended from the litter to perform it, I saw four persons riding a litter. I was very surprised. One of them asked: Why are you surprised? You have missed your prayer and gone against your religion. I asked: How do you know about my religion? He said: You want to see the Master of your Age. I said: Yes, that is true. He indicated to one of his companions. I said: But he is having many signs.He asked: What sign do you want to see? Do you want to see this she-camel rise up to the heavens along with its litter; or only this litter should rise up to the sky? I said: Whatever of these happens will be a sign for me.

Except for Muhammad bin Qasim Alawi Aqiqi, none of them was Shia. It was the 6th of Zilhajj of the year 293 A.H. A young man approached us wearing Ihraam dress and carrying his slippers in his hands. He came among us and due to his awe and majesty we stood up and greeted him with Salaam. He glanced to the left and right and sat down among us. He asked: ‘Do you know what His Eminence, Imam Ja’far Sadiq used to say in his supplication?’ We asked: ‘What did he recite?’ He said: ‘He used to say: O Allah, indeed I ask You by Your name due to which the sky and the earth stand, and by which it is possible to distinguish between right and wrong. Due to which different and separated people come together and by which there develop differences and dispersion in cohesive groups; and through which are calculated the number of sand particles in the desert, the weight of the mountains and the measure of water in the oceans. Bless Muhammad and the Progeny of Muhammad and widen and ease all my affairs for me.’ Then he stood up and we also followed by way of respect. He began to perform the circumambulation (Tawaf). As a result of his awe we forgot to ask him who he was. The next day at the same time, he completed the Tawaf and came to us and sat down among us in the same way. Then he glanced to the right and left and asked: ‘Do you know what supplication Amirul Momineen used to recite after the obligatory prayers?’ We asked: ‘What did he recite?’ He said: ‘He used to recite as follows: O Allah, it is towards You that voices are raised. Supplications are addressed to You alone. Before You only are cheeks placed in submission. Humility and lowliness is shown to You. Your command is honored in all the matters. O the best of those who are beseeched and One Who is better than all those who bestow. O the true one, O the forgiving one. O one who never breaks His promise. O one who also commands to ask from Him and also promises the fulfillment of supplications. O one who has said: ‘Call upon Me, I will answer you.’ O one who said: ‘And when My servants ask you concerning Me, then surely I am very near; I answer the prayer of the suppliant when he calls on Me, so they should answer My call and believe in Me that they may walk in the right way.’ O one who said: Say: ‘O my servants! Who have acted extravagantly against their own souls, do not despair of the mercy of Allah; surely Allah forgives the faults altogether; surely He is the Forgiving the Merciful.’ Then he looked to the right and the left and asked: ‘Do you know what Amirul Momineen used to recite in the prostration of thankfulness (Sajdah Shukr)? ‘Please tell us what he used to say,’ we replied. He said: ‘He used to say: The weeping of those who weep does not increase anything, except Your generosity and kindness. O one who has the treasures of the heavens and the earth. O one whose mercy is widespread, my sins cannot restrain Your favors from reaching me for which I pray to You. Regarding my affairs, do what befits You. You are powerful over every type of punishment and You have complete right upon all of them. I have no argument to support my case in Your court and neither have I an opportunity to present excuse. I present my sins to You and confess of having committed them, so that You may forgive them and You are the best of those who know. I dissociate myself of all the sins that I have committed and all the mistakes I made and all the evils deeds I have committed. My Lord, forgive me and have mercy on me and overlook all that You know – for You are the most powerful and kind.’ After that he arose and began to circle the Kaaba. We also rose up to pay respect. The next day he again came to us at the same time and like the previous day we welcomed and greeted him. He sat down in our company and glanced at the right and left. Then he said: Ali Ibnul Husain, Chief of those who prostrate (Sayyid us-Saajideen) used to recite this at this place in prostration (so saying he pointed to the Black Stone): ‘Your slave is at Your threshold, Your destitute is at Your door, You are asked for those things over which none, except You have power.’ Then he looked to the right and the left and glanced at Muhammad bin Qasim Alawi from among us and said: ‘O Muhammad bin Qasim, you are, if Allah wills, on the right path.’ Then he arose and entered the circling of the Kaaba. There was none among us that had not learnt by heart the supplications he had recited, but we forgot to ask him about himself everyday. Mahmoodi asked us: ‘Do you know this man?’ ‘No,’ we replied. He said: ‘By Allah, he is the Master of your time.’ We asked: ‘How do you know, O Abu Ali?’ He said: ‘I prayed to my Lord for seven years to let me have the glimpse of the Master of the Age.’ Abu Ali said: [After seven years] In the afternoon [Asr] at Arafah I saw that same gentleman supplicating. I asked: Who is this supplication from? He replied: From the people. I asked: From which people? He replied: From Arabs. I asked: ‘From which Arab clan?’ He said: ‘From the most noble and high clan.’ I asked: ‘Which is that?’ He replied: ‘Banu Hashim.’ I asked: ‘From which branch of Banu Hashim?’ He said: ‘That which is foremost in giving counsel and worthy of praise in its loftiness.’ I asked: ‘From which of these persons?’ He said: ‘From those who split the heads, fed the poor and prayed in the dead of the night when the people slept.’ I said to myself that he was an Alawite and that is why I was inclined to him. Then he disappeared suddenly from my sight and I don’t know where he went. I asked those around him whether they knew that Alawite gentleman. ‘Yes,’ they replied, ‘He comes with us every year on foot to perform Hajj.’ I told them that I didn’t see the effect of walking in him. Then I returned to Muzdalifah in grief and sorrow. That same night I saw the Holy Prophet (s) in dream. He said: ‘O Ahmad, you have seen what you desired.’ I said: ‘My master, who was he?’ He replied: ‘The one you saw yesterday in the afternoon (Asr) was the Imam of your time.’ Abu Nuaim, the narrator of this tradition says: When I heard this from Abu Ali Mahmoodi, I scolded him why he did not inform us about it.

Listen, I performed twenty Hajjs hoping to meet Imam Mahdi , but I was not successful. One night I dreamt that a caller was saying: O Ali bin Ibrahim, the Almighty Allah has permitted me to perform the Hajj. I could not understand that statement that night, but in the morning, when I got the import of it, I began to wait eagerly for the Hajj season. When the Hajj season arrived, I prepared for the journey and set out to Medina. When I reached Medina, I inquired from the people about the descendants of Imam Hasan Askari , but could not get any information. I was very much worried and at last set out for Mecca. On the way, one day at Johfa I headed for Ghadeer, which is at a distance of four miles from Johfa. I reached there and prayed in the Masjid and after that I supplicated the Almighty Allah very fervently; but the aim was not fulfilled there also. So I went to Asfsan and thus passing each stage in turn, reached Mecca. I stayed there for some days and was engrossed in Tawaf and other devotions. One night, when I was doing the Tawaf, I noticed an extremely handsome and fragrant young man walking about and doing the Tawaf of the Kaaba. Some feelings arose in my heart; I moved towards him and touched him. He asked: Where do you belong to? I said: Iraq. He asked: Where in Iraq? I said: Ahwaz. He asked: Do you know Ibn Khazib? I said: May Allah have mercy on him, he has passed away. He also expressed regret and said: May Allah have mercy on him, he used to spend the nights in worship and was a sincere supplicant. Do you know Ali bin Ibrahim Mahziyar also? I said: I am Ali bin Ibrahim. He said: O Abul Hasan, may Allah keep you in health. Where is the sign that you received from Imam Hasan Askari ? I said: It is with me. He said: All right, take it out. When I took it out and he saw it, he was moved by it. After that he said: O Mahziyar, the order for you is that you go on your way and make preparations. When a part of the night has passed, you should come to the pass of Bani Aamir. You will find me there. Thus, I returned to my lodging and when it was past midnight, I prepared my mount, loaded my belongings and sat astride the animal to set out for the pass of Bani Aamir. On reaching there, I found that same youth calling out for me, saying: O Abul Hasan, come this side. I turned my mount in that direction. When I reached him, he greeted me and said: Follow me, brother. We set out from there making conversation, passing the mountains of Arafat and finally reached the mountains of Mina. The dawn was about to break when we were between the hills of Taif. That youth asked me to dismount and recite the Midnight Prayer. I performed the Midnight Prayer and he asked me to recite the Watr Prayer; which I also performed. Then he said: Recite the dawn recitations and perform the prostration of thanks, which I also completed. After that he mounted and asked me also to mount my beast. Then we set out from there till we reached the mountain peaks of Taif. He asked: Can you see anything? I replied: Yes, I can see a sand dune on which a woolen tent is fixed through which light is filtering and this sight is pleasing to me. He said: That is our destination. Then he said: All right brother, move on. He started and I followed him till we came down from the mountains and he said: Now dismount from your beast as even tyrants have to show humility here, and leave the rein free. I asked: Who is there to take care of my beast? He said: This is the sanctuary of Imam Qaim and none, but a believer can enter and neither will anyone leave it, except for a believer. I left the rein and the two of us began to walk till that youth reached the tent entrance asking me to wait outside. He returned after a few moments and asked me to enter. When I entered, I saw a person dressed in waist cloth, with a sheet covering him. He was wheaten complexion, medium height, round head, wide forehead, eyebrows joined, prominent nose, full cheeks and a mole on his right cheek; it seemed as if a grain of musk was placed on Amber. When I noticed His Eminence, I greeted him and he replied to me and asked me about the people of Iraq. I said: Master, the people of Iraq are living a life of disgrace and they are the most degraded of all. He said: O Ibn Mahziyar, one day you will rule them just as they are ruling you today and that day, they shall be humiliated. I said: Master, you are very remote from your country and this will take a long time. He said: O Ibn Mahziyar, my father, His Eminence, Abu Muhammad has told me not to live in the community on which the Almighty Allah is infuriated and that which is failure in the world as well as the hereafter; and a painful chastisement is reserved for them. He also told me to live in inaccessible mountains away from habitations. Allah is your helper, live in dissimulation till the Almighty Allah allows me to reappear. I asked: When will this reappearance be? He replied: When you would be denied access to Kaaba. When the sun and the moon come together and will be surrounded by planets and stars. I asked: Son of the Messenger of Allah, when will this come about? He replied: In so-and-so year, when Dabbatul Ardh will appear between Safa and Marwah. Who would be having the staff of Prophet Musa , the ring of Prophet Sulaiman . He will usher people to the field of gathering. The narrator says: I stayed there for some days, after which I was ordered to return. I came back to my lodge and then set out from Mecca to Kufa. My servant was present to serve me on the way and throughout the journey I was in absolute comfort. May the Almighty Allah bless Muhammad and his Purified Progeny.”"

We continued our journey till we reached Nawawis at dawn. When we sat down at a spot, he dug in the sand with his fingers and water appeared. He performed ablution and prayed thirteen units of prayer. Then he said: Go to Abul Hasan Ali bin Yahya, convey my greetings to him and say that a person has told him to give you a hundred dinars from the seven hundred dinars that are buried at such and such place. So I went to his place immediately, knocked at his door and a maid called out from inside: Who is there? I said: Tell your master that Abu Surah has come to meet him. I heard Abul Hasan remark: What does Abu Surah have to do with me? But in spite of that he came out and I narrated the whole story to him. He went inside and brought a hundred dinars and gave them to me. Then he asked: Did you shake hands with the Imam? Yes, I said. He took my hand and rubbed it on his face and eyes."

His mother was Saiqal; his patronymic is Abul Qasim and the Messenger of Allah (s) had mentioned the same patronymic and said: His name will be same as mine, his patronymic will be same as mine and his title will be Mahdi. He will be the Divine Proof, the Awaited one and the Master of the Age. Ismail bin Ali further says: When Imam Hasan Askari was in his fatal illness, I was present with him. He summoned his servant, Aqeed, who was a Nubian black. Prior to this he was in the employ of Imam Ali Naqi . It was he that had brought up Imam Hasan Askari . Imam told him: “O Aqeed, boil for me some mastic water.” Aqeed obeyed and after the water was procured, Saiqal, the mother of Imam Mahdi (a.t.f.s.) brought it to His Eminence. His Eminence took hold of the vessel, but his hands shook so much that the bowl clattered against his teeth. The Imam let go of the vessel and said to Aqeed: “Go inside the house where you will find a boy in prostration. Bring him to me.” Abu Sahl says: Aqeed said: When I went inside to bring that boy I saw that the boy was in prostration and had raised his index finger to the sky. I saluted him. He shortened his Prayer. I said respectfully: “The master has called you.” At that moment his mother arrived and taking his hand brought him to his father. Abu Sahl says: When the boy came to His Eminence, he saluted him. I saw that his face was glowing like a pearl; he had short hair and wide teeth. When the eyes of Imam Hasan Askari fell on him, he wept and said: “O master of my family, give me this water, so that I may proceed to my Lord.” The young master complied and taking up the bowl of mastic water brought it to the lips of his father, so that he may drink it. Imam Hasan Askari said: “Prepare me for the ritual prayer.” That child kept a towel before the Imam and made ablution for him by washing his face and hands in turn. Then he rubbed his head and both feet. The Imam said: “My son, I give you glad tidings that you are the Master of the Time and the Proof of Allah on the earth. You are my son and successor. You are born from me and you are M-H-M-D the son of Hasan son of Ali son of Muhammad son of Ali son of Musa son of Ja’far son of Muhammad son of Ali son of Husain son of Ali Ibn Abi Talib and you are from the progeny of the Holy Prophet (s) and the last of the Purified Imams . And the Messenger of Allah (s) gave glad tidings about you and informed about your name and patronymic. This was told to me by my father from his purified forefathers – blessings of Allah be on Ahle Bayt. Indeed our Lord alone is worthy of praise and glorification.” Imam Hasan bin Ali Askari spoke these sentences and passed away at that very moment. May Allah bless them all."

who saw the Imam of the Time,Ḥadīth #19,238- عنه، عن أبي الحسين محمد بن جعفر الأسدي قال:حدثني الحسين بن محمد بن عامر الاشعري القمي، قال: حدثني يعقوب بن يوسف الضراب الغساني-في منصرفه من إصفهان- قال:حججت في سنة إحدى وثمانين ومائتين وكنت مع قوم مخالفين من أهل بلدنا. فلما قدمنا مكة تقدم بعضهم فاكترى لنا دارا في زقاق بين سوق الليل، وهي دار خديجة عليها السلام تسمى دار الرضا عليه السلام، وفيها عجوز سمراء فسألتها- لما وقفت على أنها دار الرضا عليه السلام- ما تكونين من أصحاب هذه الدار؟ ولم سميت دار الرضا؟ فقالت: أنا من مواليهم وهذه دار الرضا علي بن موسى عليهما السلام، أسكنيها الحسن بن علي عليهما السلام، فإني كنت من خدمه. فلما سمعت ذلك منها آنست بها وأسررت الأمر عن رفقائي المخالفين، فكنت إذا انصرفت من الطواف بالليل أنام معهم في رواق في الدار، ونغلق الباب ونلقي خلف الباب حجرا كبيرا كنا ندير خلف الباب. فرأيت غير ليلة ضوء السراج في الرواق الذي كنا فيه شبيها بضوء المشعل، ورأيت الباب قد انفتح ولا أرى أحدا فتحه من أهل الدار، ورأيت رجلا ربعة أسمر إلى الصفرة ما هو قليل اللحم، في وجهه سجادة عليه قميصان وإزار رقيق قد تقنع به وفي رجله نعل طاق فصعد إلى الغرفة في الدار حيث كانت العجوز تسكن، وكانت تقول لنا إن في الغرفة ابنـة لا تـدع أحدا يصعـد إليها، فكنت أرى الضوء الذي رأيته يضئ في الرواق على الدرجة عند صعود الرجل إلى الغرفة التي يصعدها، ثم أراه في الغرفة من غير أن أرى السراج بعينه، وكان الذين معي يرون مثل ما أرى فتوهموا أن يكون هذا الرجل يختلف إلى إبنة العجوز، وأن يكون قد تمتع بها فقالوا:هؤلاء العلوية يرون المتعة، وهذا حرام لا يحل فيما زعموا، وكنا نراه يدخل ويخرج ونجئ إلى الباب وإذا الحجر على حاله الذي تركناه، وكنا نغلق هذا الباب خوفا على متاعنا، وكنا لا نرى أحدا يفتحه ولا يغلقه، والرجل يدخل ويخرج والحجر خلف الباب إلى وقت ننحيه إذا خرجنا. فلما رأيت هذه الاسباب ضرب على قلبي ووقعت في قلبي فتنة فتلطفت العجوز وأحببت أن أقف على خبر الرجل، فقلت لها: يا فلانة إني أحب أن أسألك وأفاوضك من غير حضور من معي فلا أقدر عليه، فأنا أحب إذا رأيتني في الدار وحدي أن تنزلي إلي لاسألك عن أمر، فقالت لي مسرعة: وأنا أريد أن أسر إليك شيئا فلم يتهيأ لي ذلك من أجل من معك، فقلت ما أردت أن تقولي؟ فقالت: يقول لك-ولم تذكر أحدا-لا تخاشن أصحابك وشركاء‌ك ولا تلاحهم، فإنهم أعداؤك ودارهم، فقلت لها:من يقول؟ فقالت:أنا أقول، فلم أجسر لما دخل قلبي من الهيبة أن أراجعها، فقلت أي أصحابي تعنين؟ فظننت أنها تعني رفقائي الذين كانوا حجاجا معي قالت: شركاؤك الذين في بلدك وفي الدار معك، وكان جرى بيني وبين الذين معي في الدار عنت في الدين، فسعوا بي حتى هربت واستترت بذلك السبب فوقفت على أنها عنت أولئك، فقلت لها ما تكونين أنت من الرضا؟ فقالت كنت خادمة للحسن بن علي عليهما السلام، فلما استيقنت ذلك قلت: لاسألنها عن الغائب عليه السلام، فقلت: بالله عليك رأيته بعينك، فقالت:يا أخي لم أره بعيني فإني خرجت وأختي حبلى وبشرني الحسن بن علي عليهما السلام بأني سوف أراه في آخر عمري، وقال لي:تكونين له كما كنت لي. وأنا اليوم منذ كذا بمصر وإنما قدمت الآن بكتابة ونفقة وجه بها إلي على يدي رجل من أهل خراسان لا يفصح بالعربية، وهي ثلاثون دينارا وأمرني أن أحج سنتي هذه فخرجت رغبة مني في أن أراه فوقع في قلبي أن الرجل الذي كنت أراه يدخل ويخرج هو هو. فأخذت عشرة دراهم صحاحا، فيها ستة رضوية من ضرب الرضا عليه السلام قد كنت خبأتها لالقيها في مقام إبراهيم عليه السلام، وكنت نذرت ونويت ذلك، فدفعتها إليها وقلت في نفسي أدفعها إلى قوم من ولد فـاطمة عليهـا السـلام أفضـل ممـا ألقيها في المقام وأعظم ثوابا، فقلت لها: إدفعي هذه الدراهم إلى من يستحقها من ولد فاطمة عليها السلام، وكان في نيتي أن الذي رأيته هو الرجل، وإنما تدفعها إليه، فأخذت الدراهم وصعدت وبقيت ساعة ثم نزلت، فقالت: يقول لك:ليس لنا فيها حق إجعلها في الموضع الذي نويت، ولكن هذه الرضوية خذ منا بدلها وألقها في الموضع الذي نويت، ففعلت وقلت في نفسي:الذي أمرت به عن الرجل. ثم كان معي نسخة توقيع خرج إلى القاسم بن العلاء بآذربيجان فقلت لها:تعرضين هذه النسخة على إنسان قد رأى توقيعات الغائب، فقالت ناولني فإني أعرفها، فأريتها النسخة وظننت أن المرأة تحسن أن تقرأ فقالت:لا يمكنني أن أقرا في هذا المكان فصعدت الغرفة ثم أنزلته فقالت: صحيح وفي التوقيع أبشركم ببشرى ما بشرت به (إياه) وغيره. ثم قالت: يقول لك إذا صليت على نبيك صلى الله عليه وآله. كيف تصلي (عليه)؟ فقلت أقول:اللهم صل على محمد وآل محمد وبارك على محمد وآل محمد كأفضل ما صليت وباركت وترحمت على إبراهيم وآل إبراهيم إنك حميد مجيد. فقال: لا، إذا صليت عليهم فصل عليهم كلهم وسمهم. فقلت: نعم، فلما كانت من الغد نزلت ومعها دفتر صغير، فقالت: يقول لك: إذا صليت على النبي فصل عليه وعلى أوصيائه على هذه النسخة، فأخذتها وكنت أعمل بها، ورأيت عدة ليال قد نزل من الغرفة وضوء السراج قائم. وكنت أفتح الباب وأخرج على أثر الضوء وأنا أراه-أعني الضوء-ولا أرى أحد حتى يدخل المسجد، وأرى جماعة من الرجال من بلدان شتى يأتون باب هذه الدار، فبعضهم يدفعـون إلى العجـوز رقاعـا معهم، ورأيت العجوز قد دفعت إليهـم كذلك الرقـاع فيكلمونها وتكلمهم ولا أفهم عنهم، ورأيت منهم في منصرفنا جماعة في طريقي إلى أن قدمت بغداد. نسخة الدفتر

Ghassani on his return from Isfahan that: “I performed Hajj with some Sunni persons of my town in 281 A.H. When we reached Mecca, one of our companions took for us a house on rent in the Sauqul Lail Street. It was a fortunate chance that the house was a property of Ummul Momineen Lady Khadija (s) and which was now known as Darul Ridha and was occupied an old lady. When I came to know that the house was called Darul Ridha, I asked that old lady how she was related to the owner of the house and why it was called Darul Ridha? She said: I am one of the slave girls of the owner of the house and this house belongs to Ali Ibn Musa Ridha . Imam Hasan Askari has accommodated me in it, because I had been in his service. I was impressed by that old lady, but I did not disclose it to my Sunni friends. Whenever I returned from Tawaf at night, I slept in the verandah with them. We used to close the door and also place a huge stone behind it. One night I saw a lamp in the verandah where we slept. Then I saw the door being opened automatically and a medium stature, wheat complexion and physically fit young man having a mark of prostration, wearing a shirt, a wrap and wearing shoes without socks, enter and ascend to the attic occupied by the old lady. She had told us not to go up, as her daughter lived there. When the man went to the attic, I noticed that the light present in the verandah had now reached the attic. My friends also noted this and they thought that the man was visiting the daughter of that old lady and it seemed as if he had done a Mutah marriage with her; and that this Alawite lady considered it lawful, ‘although it was not so’. Thus we saw that man regularly, but when we checked the door, we found it closed and the stone was also intact. I became curious and I decided to ask the old lady about him. One day I said: O so-and-so, I want to ask you something in private, but I don’t get a chance as others are also present. So when you notice that I am alone, you should come down from the attic. She also said: I also want to speak to you in private, but I don’t get a chance. I asked: What do you want to talk to me about? She said: See, don’t mention this to anyone; he has told you not to fight with your companions and associates. I asked: Who has told this? She replied: I say it. Since I was suspicious from before, I did not dare to ask anything else. I just asked what she meant by companions? (I was thinking that she was implying my present companions.). But she said: People who live with you in your house in town (and the fact was that I had regular controversies with them about religious matters). So they complained about me and I ran away from there and went into hiding and now I understood that she was talking about them. I asked: What is your concern with Imam Ali Ridha She said: I am the maid of Imam Hasan Askari . When I became certain that she was connected to that family, I asked her about the hidden Imam and said: I adjure you; please tell me if you have really seen him yourself. She said: Though I have never seen him myself, because when I had left that place, my sister was pregnant, but Imam Hasan Askari had given me the glad tiding that I will see him at the end of my life and that I will be to him same as I was to Imam Hasan Askari . Then she said: At present I live in Egypt, and I have come here, because he sent a letter and thirty dinars to me with a Khurasani man unfamiliar with Arabic and asked me to perform the Hajj. I came here hoping to see him as well. Now I became sure that the man who frequented the attic was the Imam of the time. I took out the ten dirhams from which six were reserved for Imam Mahdi . I had initially vowed to put them at Maqam Ibrahim, but later I thought that it was best to spend them on the descendants of Lady Fatima (s). So I gave the ten dirhams to that lady and said: Give them to one who in your view is most deserving from the descendants of Lady Fatima (s). I was expecting that she would give it to the man who visited her place regularly. She took the money to the attic and returned after sometime and said: I am not entitled to take it, you may put it where you had vowed to, although you can take change it from dirham Razavia into another currency and put it there (I did that and said to myself that whatever you have been ordered was from that gentleman only). Then I also had a copy of an epistle, which came from Qasim bin Alaa in Azerbaijan. I said to that lady: Show this copy to him, he definitely would be familiar with the writings of Imam Mahdi . She said: Give it, I am familiar with it. I showed it to her and was thinking that perhaps she will be able to read it. She said: I cannot read it here. Then she took it upstairs and then came down after sometime and said: Yes, it is correct. And I also have some good news to you, which is beneficial to you and others as well. After that she said: He is asking how you invoke blessings on your Prophet? I replied: I do it as follows: Allaahumma Salli alaa Muhammad wa Aali Muhammad wa Baarik Alaa Muhammad wa Aali Muhammad ka Afzali maa Sallaita wa baarakta wa tarahamta alaa Ibrahima wa aali Ibrahima innaka hameedum Majeed. (O Allah, bless Muhammad and the progeny of Muhammad and sanctify Muhammad and the progeny of Muhammad with the best of the blessings with which You bless and sanctify Ibrahim and the progeny of Ibrahim. Indeed You are the praised one and the majestic.) She said: No, when you invoke blessings, you should mention each name separately. I said: Alright. The next day when she came down, she had a slip of paper with her. She said: He says: When you invoke blessings on your Prophet, you should do so according to this formula. I accepted the note and began to act accordingly. Then on many nights I saw him descend from the attic and the light accompanied him. I used to open the door and follow the light, but I could only see a light and that person did not become visible to me, till he reached the courtyard of the Kaaba. I also saw people from various countries visit the house and hand over their requests to that old lady. I also saw her returning them to the applicants along with their replies and spoke to them in a language, which I could not understand. I also met some of them on the way back home till I reached Baghdad. The Durood supplication, which was written by Imam Mahdi for me is as follows: “In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. O Allah, bless Muhammad, who is the chief of the messengers and the proof of the Lord of the world. Who was selected on the day of the covenant, who is the chosen and selected one from the shaded springs; purified from every trouble, immune from every defect, hopeful for salvation and one having discretion of intercession in the religion of Allah. O Allah, accord honor to the edifice of his religion and grant respect to those evidences and give salvation to his proof and exalt his status. Illumine his effulgence further and make his face more illuminated and increase his merits. And also increase his honor and raise up the effectiveness of his intercession and make his position the praised one, that the formers and the latters may envy. And bless Amirul Momineen Ali Ibn Abi Talib and the successor of the divine messengers and the one who had a brilliant countenance and the leader of the worshippers and the chief of the successors and the proof of the Lord of the worlds. And bless Hasan bin Ali, Imam of the believers, successor of the messengers and proof of the Lord of the worlds. And bless Husain bin Ali, Imam of the believers, successor of the messengers and proof of the Lord of the worlds. And bless Ali Ibnul Husain, Imam of the believers, successor of the messengers and proof of the Lord of the worlds. And bless Muhammad Ibn Ali, Imam of the believers, successor of the messengers and proof of the Lord of the worlds. And bless Ja’far Ibn Muhammad, Imam of the believers, successor of the messengers and proof of the Lord of the worlds. And bless Musa Ibn Ja’far, Imam of the believers, successor of the messengers and proof of the Lord of the worlds.And bless Ali Ibn Musa, Imam of the believers, successor of the messengers and proof of the Lord of the worlds. And bless Muhammad Ibn Ali, Imam of the believers, successor of the messengers and proof of the Lord of the worlds. And bless Ali Ibn Muhammad, Imam of the believers, successor of the messengers and proof of the Lord of the worlds. And bless Hasan Ibn Ali, Imam of the believers, successor of the messengers and proof of the Lord of the worlds. And bless Khalaf Salih (righteous successor), the guide and the guided, Imam of the believers, successor of the messengers and proof of the Lord of the worlds. O Allah, bless Muhammad and his Ahle Bayt , the guiding Imams and guided ones, the truthful learned, the righteous and pious, supports of Your religion, pillars of Your Oneness, interpreters of Your revelation, Your proofs on Your creatures and Your representatives on Your earth, whom You have chosen for Yourself, and selected them from Your servants, satisfied them with Your religion, specialized them with Your recognition, bestowed them with Your nobility, humbled them with Your mercy, fed them with Your blessing, nourished them with Your wisdom, dressed them up in Your light, raised them with Your kingdom, surrounded them with Your angels, honored them with Your Prophet. O Allah, bless Muhammad and exceeding blessings be upon them, eternal, pure, no one is surrounded with it, except You and none can encompass it, except Your knowledge and no one can encompass it other than You. O Allah, bless Your Wali, enlivener of Your Sunnah, establisher of Your command, caller towards You, proof upon You and proof on Your creatures, Your caliph on Your earth and witness on Your servants. O Allah, exalt his help, increase his lifespan and embellish the earth by increasing his survival. O Allah, suffice him from the greed of the jealous, protect him from the mischief of plotters, prevent from him the intentions of the oppressors and deliver him from the hands of the tyrants. O Allah, bestow him in his self, his progeny, his followers, his subjects, his confidants, his common ones, his enemies and all the people of the world whatever is near to his view and which is easy for his self and fulfill the best of his aspirations in the world and the hereafter, indeed You are powerful over everything. O Allah, put back, through him, in original form that which has been uprooted from Your religion, put in order again through him the confusion created in Your Book. Make clear, through him, the distortions made in Your commandments, so that Your religion regains its true spirit, on his hands, blooming and full of tenderness, progressive, up to date, liberated, savior, without doubts and uncertainties, without suspicions and obscurities, there being no falsehood lingering around him, nor any subversive activities in his presence.O Allah, enlighten the world with his truth and make oppression and tyranny take fright and flee, put a stop to reversal and subversion by relying upon him, once for all, pull down the edifice of corrupt wickedness forever by giving him a free hand, through him break up entirely totalitarianism, let him deal the death-blow and wipe out the existence of the damned and accursed, and put an end to oppression perpetrated by the unjust tyrants, and set up justice and fairplay, put in force his “rule of life”, far and wide, everywhere, over all jurisdictions, make all authorities serve to promote his sovereignty. O Allah, whoso runs away from him should be discredited and put to shame, whoso undermines his mission should be eliminated, whoso looks upon him with envy, and quarrel, may be cornered, back to the wall, whoso knows, but denies his right may rot and disintegrate, make lighter and easy his mission, make haste to set in motion blossoming of his truth, let his glory shine in full brightness. O Allah, bless Muhammad, the Chosen, Ali, who pleased (Allah) better than others, Fatima, the bright and beautiful, Hasan, the agreeing, Husain, the refined, and all the rest of the closely connected appointed guardians, the favorite confidants, the signs leading unto guidance, lighthouse of piety and wisdom, the trustworthy and safe handles, the strong rope, the right path. Bless Your dearest intimate friend, the authority You promised to protect, and (bless) the Imams, his children, spread their creed, build up their cause, let their thoughts and deeds reach far and wide, to the four corners of the world, in the matter of religion, in the worldly affairs and at the time of Final Judgment, verily You are able to do all things.”"

This was while a huge amount of Khums had been deposited with my father; so he carried them and boarded a ship. I went with him to accompany him. He got a very severe fever and said to me, “My son, take me back, take me back. This is death. And fear Allah in this Khums.” He confided his final will to me and died. I said to myself that my father had not asked me to do anything wrong. I will carry these goods to Iraq and will rent a house there and will not inform anyone. If things became clear to me like their clarity during the days of Imam Hasan Askari , I will hand the goods over, or else, distribute them as alms. I went to Iraq and rented a house by the river. I had remained there but a few days that a messenger brought a letter to me saying: O Muhammad, you have brought this and this in such and such parcels; recounting all of the goods that were with me of which I did not know myself. I gave them to the messenger. I remained there a few more days and was not given any attention, which made me rather sad. Then a letter came, “We have appointed you in the position of your father, so thank Allah.”"

So much so that Qazwini denied the existence of His Eminence, the Awaited Imam . However, others stressed that the successor of His Eminence was present and he is His Eminence, Imam Mahdi . They wrote a letter to the Awaited Imam and related their discussion with Qazwini. His Eminence replied as follows: In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. May the Almighty Allah keep you and us safe from the mischiefs and may He bestow you and us with certainty and may He also protect you and us from bad consequences. Information regarding doubt and denial of a group from you in religion and matter of guardianship (Wilayat) has reached us. Our sorrow and anger is for you and not for our own selves, as the Almighty Allah is with us, therefore except for Him, we are not needful of anyone else and the truth is with us. Therefore, I am not afraid if someone turns away from us. And we are the first creations of our Lord and (other) creatures and people were created afterwards. And you, O people! Why have you fallen into doubt and bewilderment? Have you not heard the statement of Almighty Allah: “O you who believe! Obey Allah and obey the Apostle and those in authority from among you…” (4:59) Don’t you know that it has come in traditional reports that unforeseen events had befallen the past and would befall the remaining Imams? Have you not seen how in all the times, the Almighty Allah had made a refuge for you to seek protection in? He appointed torches of guidance from the time of Adam till Imam Hasan Askari that you may obtain guidance and direction, in such a way that whenever a guide went away, another one took up his place and torch. When the Almighty Allah took away Imam Hasan Askari , do you think He has rendered His religion invalid and severed His relation with the creatures? Never! Till the Day of Judgment and the time of the issue of Allah’s command, which is not in favor of the people, it cannot be thus. Indeed, His Eminence, Imam Hasan Askari passed away with success and good fortune like his respected forefathers and in such a condition that his knowledge and will is present with us. And his successor would perform his functions. And except for an unjust criminal, no one has any dispute with us in this matter. And except for a denier disbeliever, no one claims this divine position of ours. And if it would not have rendered the command of Allah to be subverted and His secret had not been exposed, our right upon you would have become so clear that your intellects would have been amazed and your doubts and uncertainties would have disappeared. However, what Allah has willed, predestined and written would surely happen and nothing except that. Then fear Allah and submit to our affair, and leave this matter with us. And do not persist in seeking that which Allah has concealed and don’t get deviated to the left and right. And make our right and illuminated path as the aim. Indeed, I wish for your well-being and Allah is witness upon you and me. If I had no affection for you and had not desired mercy and goodness for you, I would not have said anything to you. It is by way of trial and divine test for us that a misguided oppressor, without any right has become a prisoner of his selfish desires and usurped the right of others. Like the daughter of the Messenger of Allah, it is obligatory that I should be patient and in the end the ignorant and tyrant would see the consequences of his deeds. May Allah Almighty protect you and us from perditions, calamities and evils. And Allah is having authority and power on them and blessings and mercy of Allah be upon all the successors, saints and believers. And may Allah bless Muhammad, the Prophet, and his progeny and peace be upon them."

Ahmad bin Ishaq says that when I read Ja’far bin Ali’s letter, I wrote a letter to the Imam of the Time and also enclosed Ja’far’s letter. The following reply came from the Imam: In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. May Allah keep you safe and in health. I received your communication and also the letter that you had enclosed. I went through it; there are many contradictions and mistakes in it. If you had read carefully, you would also have realized this. Praise be to the Lord of the worlds in which no one else has any share that He favored and blessed us. Allah, the Mighty and Sublime does not want anything, except to complete the truth and to destroy falsehood and He will witness what I am saying. The day in which there is no doubt, He will ask us about that in which we differ. The Almighty Allah has not appointed the writer of this letter as an Imam on anyone of us nor made it obligatory to obey him. Let me explain in detail, so that it is sufficient for you. Ahmad bin Ishaq, may Allah have mercy on you. Almighty Allah did not create anyone in vain and neither did He leave it free after creation. On the contrary, He created them from His power, gave them ears, eyes, hearts and brains. Then He sent prophets to them as givers of glad tidings and warners, so that they may command them to the obedience of Allah and restrain them from His disobedience; that they inform them about their creator of which they are ignorant; and He sent scriptures and angels to them to maintain a difference between them and common people and that their excellence over them is proved. Then He gave miracles and a number of signs to them. Thus He cooled the fire for some of them and made them as His confidante (Khalil). To some He spoke and made his staff a serpent. Some of them enlivened the dead and cured the lepers through Allah’s permission. To some He gave the knowledge of the language of birds. He gave something from everything to them. Then He sent Muhammad (s) as the mercy for the worlds and completed His favors on him and concluded His prophethood on him and made him the Prophet for the whole universe. Thus the truths expressed by him are clear to all and all are aware of the miracles shown by him. After that the Almighty Allah captured the soul of the Messenger of Allah (s) and transferred this matter to his cousin, brother, successor and legatee, Ali Ibn Abi Talib . Then the matter of guidance went to his successors one after another, so that through them they may keep His religion alive and complete His light and He kept a clear difference between them and their brothers and cousins, so that the Divine Proof and Imam can be differentiated from common people by keeping the Imams pure from all sins and pure of every defect and appointed them as trustees of His treasure and bearers of His secrets and helped them through miracles and proofs. And if this had not been there, all the people would have been equal and all would have claimed Imamate. No difference would have remained between right and wrong and the ignorant and the knowledgeable. That false claimant has made a false claim on the Almighty Allah and I don’t know how he can prove the veracity of his claim. Can he prove it through the knowledge and jurisprudence of the religion of Allah? By Allah, he does not even know what is lawful and what is unlawful, what is right and what is wrong; what is clear and what is ambiguous. He does not even know the limits and times of prayers. Can he prove his Imamate through piety? The Almighty Allah is a witness that he left obligatory prayers for forty days in order to learn black magic. You should know that he has wine cups and other tools of sinful activities. Can he prove his claim from some miracles? If it is so, let him bring some miracle or any other evidence of Imamate. The Almighty Allah says in the Holy Quran: “Ha Mim. The revelation of the Book is from Allah, the Mighty, the Wise. We did not create the heavens and the earth and what is between the two save with truth and (for) an appointed term; and those who disbelieve turn aside from what they are warned of. Say: Have you considered what you call upon besides Allah? Show me what they have created of the earth, or have they a share in the heavens? Bring me a book before this or traces of knowledge, if you are truthful. And who is in greater error than he who calls besides Allah upon those that will not answer him till the day of resurrection and they are heedless of their call? And when men are gathered together they shall be their enemies, and shall be deniers of their worshipping (them).” (46:1-6) May Allah give you divine opportunity (Taufeeq), ask him that which I have told you and test him and ask him interpretation of any verse of Quran or ask him a question about Daily Prayers, so that you may find how much he knows and what defect he has. The Almighty Allah has secured truth with those who are deserving of it and has placed it at its center. And He cannot accept that after Imam Hasan and Imam Husain the post of Imamate should go to two brothers. And when Allah the Mighty and Sublime permits us to speak the truth, the truth will come out and falsehood will be destroyed. I ask for Allah’s help; He is sufficient for us and the best of the helpers. May Allah bless Muhammad and Aale Muhammad ."

The Imam sent the following reply: “May the Almighty Allah keep you on guidance. You asked about those of our family and cousins. You should know that no one is related to the Almighty Allah. Anyone who denies us is not from us and his end will be same as the son of Prophet Nuh . As for the matter of my Uncle, Ja’far and his sons; it is same as the matter of the brothers of Yusuf . Barley wine is unlawful (Haraam). There is no problem in turnip extract. We only accept the monies sent by you so that you may be purified. Now whoever likes, should send it, whoever likes may not. The provision that the Almighty Allah has bestowed is better than whatever you send us. As for the reappearance and advent, it solely depends on the will of Allah and those who fix a time for it are liars. As for the saying of those who think that Imam Husain has not been slain is a kind of disbelief, denial, deviation and misguidance. But as for the problems, which will occur in the future, you should refer to the narrators of our traditions for their verdicts as they are my proofs on you, and I am Allah’s proof on them.” As for Muhammad bin Uthman Amri, may Allah be pleased with him and his father, he is trustworthy and reliable one of mine and his writing is my writing. As for Muhammad bin Ali bin Mahziyar Ahwazi, then very soon, Allah would reform his heart and remove his doubt. As for the money that you sent for me, it is not acceptable to me, except that which is pure. And the compensation for a singing girl is unlawful. As for Muhammad bin Shazan bin Naeem; he is a Shia of Ahle Bayt . As for Abul Khattab Muhammad bin Ali Zainab Ajdaa; he and all his associates are accursed and you don’t cultivate the company of those who harbor their belief; and my forefathers and I are aloof from them. As for those who are in possession of our funds, in such a way that they consider them lawful for themselves and spend them; they have in fact devoured (Hell) Fire. As for Khums, it is lawful for our Shia till the time of reappearance, so far as their children are pure and not involved in sinful activities. As for the funds that are sent to us and after which they fell into doubts and became regretful of having paid to us, then anyone who wants, we would return to him and we are not needful of the money of those who harbor doubt with regard to Allah. As for the cause of occultation, the Almighty Allah has said: “O you who believe! Do not put questions about things, which if declared to you may trouble you…” (5:101) Each of my forefathers in his time was compelled by the oath of allegiance to the tyrant ruler and when I reappear, I would not be having the allegiance of any tyrant on my neck. As for how people would benefit from me during my occultation, it is like getting benefits from the sun concealed by clouds. I am the security for folks of the earth just as stars are security for inhabitants of the heavens. Therefore, do not ask what you are not in need of and do not put yourself into undue trouble. And pray more for an early reappearance; as in it lies your success. Peace be on you, O Ishaq Ibn Yaqub and peace be on all those who follow the guidance…”"

Some say: It is impossible and not allowed for Him to do that, since only Almighty Allah can create bodies; whereas some say: Allah, the Mighty and the High has made the Holy Imams capable for this matter and delegated them, therefore they create and sustain by the permission of Allah. In any case, there arose a great dispute regarding this matter. Meanwhile someone said: Why don’t we refer to Abu Ja’far Muhammad bin Uthman Amari [special deputy of Imam] and ask him about it, so that the true belief becomes clear, since he is channel of access to Imam Mahdi ? All gave consent for referring to Abu Ja’far and accepted his invitation. On the basis of this they wrote the question and sent it to him, so that he may get its reply from Imam . The following epistle was issued in reply: Indeed, it is Allah, the Mighty and the High, who has created the bodies and distributed sustenance in such a way that He is neither having a body nor has transmigrated into a body. There is nothing, which resembles Him and He is the hearer and the Wise. And as for the Imam , they request Almighty Allah and Allah, the Mighty and the High creates. They beg from Him and Almighty Allah bestows sustenance. That is Almighty Allah fulfills their request due to the greatness of their right."

When the messenger reached Baghdad and delivered to Abu Ja’far what he had brought and then bid him farewell and was about to return, Abu Ja’far said, “There is one thing remaining, which you have been entrusted with.” “Where is it?” “Nothing is remaining with me, my master. I have submitted everything to you,” replied the messenger. “Something is remaining with you. So return to your belongings and search and remember what all was given to you,” said Abu Ja’far. The messenger left and for many days tried to remember, search and think. He did not recall anything, nor did anyone who was with him, reminded him of anything. He came back to Abu Ja’far and said: “Nothing given to me remains with me that I have not brought to your eminence.” Abu Ja’far said, “It is said that you have two Sardani garments, which were given to you by a certain man,” mentioning his name and his father’s name. “Where are they?” The messenger said: “Yes, by Allah, O my master, I totally forgot about them and I do not even remember where I have put them.” The man left and searched and opened everything he had with him and asked all he had carried something for, to look for those garments, but they were not to be found anywhere. He returned to Abu Ja’far and told him about the mishap. Abu Ja’far said, “You are ordered to go to so-and-so, the cotton seller, to whom you carried two loads of cotton in the cotton market. Open one of them having such and such writing. The two garments are on its side.” The messenger was amazed by the prediction of Abu Ja’far and went ahead to the spot and opened the load that he had told him of and there they were: two garments on the side, inserted into the cotton. He took them and brought them to Abu Ja’far and said: “I forgot them, because when I tied the goods, they were left outside by mistake, so I put them on the side of the cotton load to keep them safe.”"

Abu Sura was a prominent member of Zaidiyyah sect and he said: I stayed the day of Arafa there and when it was the time of Isha prayers, I stood up to pray. I rose and began by Surah Hamd. Suddenly, a young man of tremendous beauty, who had a summer cloak on him, also began with the same Surah and finished before me or I did before him. Later we left together from the door of the shrine. When we reached the banks of Euphrates, the young man said, “You want to go to Kufa, so go ahead.” I went ahead by the way of Euphrates and the young man took the land trail. Abu Sura continues, Feeling sorry for separating from his company, I began following him. He said, “Come.” We went together upto the foundation of the fortress of Masnath. We slept there. When we woke up, we were at the heights, at the mountain of Khandaq. He said, “You are facing hardships and have a family to support. Go to Abu Tahir Razi. He will come out to you, while his hands are drenched in blood of slaughter. Say to him a young man who had these qualities says that the bag having twenty dinars, which one of your brothers has brought, is yours. Take it from him.” Abu Sura says, I went to Abu Tahir Ibn Razi, as the young man had said and described the young man to him. He said: “Praise belongs to Allah, and you saw him.” He went inside and brought out a bag of dinars. He gave them to me and I returned. Abu Abdullah Muhammad Ibn Zaid Ibn Marwan, who is also one of the Shaykhs of the Zaidiyyah, says, I recounted this narrative to Abu Husain Muhammad Ibn Ubaidullah Alawi, when we had halted at the land of Herr. He said: This is true. A young man came to me and I recognized a sign in his face. When the people left, I asked him, “Who are you?” He said: “I am the messenger of the successor to one of his brothers in Baghdad.” I asked, “Do you have the means for travel?” “Yes, in the house of the Talhayayn.” I said, “Go and bring them.” I sent a servant with him. He brought his luggage and means of travel and stayed with me that day. He ate with me and talked about many secrets and confidential matters. I asked him, “What road are you taking?” “I will disembark at this height and then go to the valley of the sands; then I’ll go to the tents and purchase mounts and ride to the successor to the west.” Abu Husain Muhammad Ibn Ubaidullah said: Next day he rode his beast and I rode along with him. We went to the archway of the house of Salih. He crossed the channel by himself and I was watching him until he reached Najaf and then he disappeared from my eyes. Abu Abdullah Muhammad Ibn Zaid says, I recounted these two narratives to Abu Bakr Muhammad Ibn Abi Darram Yamami, who is a Shaykhs of Hashawiyya. He said: This is true.” After that he said: A few years ago, the nephew of Abu Bakr bin Nakhali Attar, who was a Sufi and who intermingled with Sufis, came to me. I asked: Who are you and from where have you come? He replied: I am a traveler and I am on a journey since last seventy years. I asked: What is the most extraordinary thing that you have seen? He replied: I stayed in a rest house in Alexandria. There was a Masjid in the center of the caravanserai, which was used by travelers. An Imam of congregation was also present there and he was a young man. He lived in his special quarters from where he emerged to lead them in prayers and returned to his room immediately. When I had stayed there for a long time and observed this practice of that young man who was extremely pure and clean and who also had a cloak upon him, I said: I would like to be present in your service. Please give me an opportunity. He replied: It is your honor, you may do so. Thus I started cultivating his company till I became very much attached to him. One day I said to him: May Almighty Allah give you honor, who are you? He replied: I am the owner of truth. I said: My master, when will you reappear? He replied: Presently, time is not ripe for the reappearance. A period still remains for it. Thus I always remained engrossed in the service of the Imam and he also continued his practice of simply leading congregational prayers without interfering in anything else, which did not concern him, till he said one day: I need to go on a journey. I asked: I will accompany you. After that I requested him: My master, when will your reappearance take place? He replied: The sign of the coming of my kingdom is that there would be confusion and discord, and too much of mischief. At that time I will come to Mecca and would be in Masjidul Haraam till people say: Appoint an Imam for us, and a long discussion will take place in this regard; till a person will rise from them and look at me. He would say: People, this man is the Mahdi, look at him and pledge allegiance to him. They would all pledge allegiance to me between Rukn and Maqam, while before that they would have despaired of my life and reappearance. We set out from there till we reached the sea shore. He intended to cross the sea. I asked: Master, by Allah, I fear the sea. Imam said: Are you afraid when I am with you? I replied: No, but I cannot dare. So Imam mounted the sea [walked on the surface] and I returned from there."

I was a young man and one of our brothers [whose name Abu Abdullah had forgotten], was with me. This was during the period of Shaykh Abul Qasim Husain Ibn Rauh, when he went into hiding and appointed Abu Ja’far Muhammad Ibn Ali known as Shalmaghani, who was at that time a righteous man and had not evinced heresy and blasphemy, which he later did. People visited him and met him, because he was a comrade of Shaykh Abul Qasim ­Husain Ibn Rauh and his emissary amongst the people with regard to their needs and necessities. My friend said to me, “Do you wish to meet Abu Ja’far and make a covenant with him, for he is the appointed man today amongst this congregation?” I wanted to ask him to request a Dua from the Imam of the Age?” I said: “Yes.” We went to him and saw a group of our faithful brethren there with him. We offered him our greetings and sat there. He turned to my comrade and asked, “Who is this young man?” He said: “A man from the house of Zurarah.” He turned to me and asked, “Which Zurarah?” I said: “My master, I am from the children of Bukair Ibn Ayyin, brother of Zurarah.” He said: “This is a majestic household, dignified in this Order.” My comrade turned to him and said: “Our master, I want to request a Dua.” He said: “Yes.” When I heard this, I also desired to request the same. I intended in my heart not to disclose it to anyone the condition of my wife, the mother of my son Abul Abbas. She and I had many differences and she was very angry at me, while I was greatly fond of her. I said in my heart that I will ask him a Dua for this problem that has been troubling me much. So I said: “May Allah prolong the life of our Master, I have a wish as well.” Shalmaghani said: “What is your wish?” I said: “I want a Dua for relief from a problem that has troubled me.” Shalmaghani took the paper that was in front of him on which he registered people’s requests and wrote, “And the man from Zurarah has a request for Dua about a matter that has troubled him.” Then he folded the paper. We rose and left. After a few days, my friend said to me, “Shouldn’t we go to Abu Ja’far and ask him about the requests we made?” I went with him and we entered ­Shalmaghani’s place. As we sat down, he took out a paper that had many requests on it, which had been answered at their sides. He turned to my friend and read to him the answer of his query. Then he turned to me as he was reading, “As for the man from Zurarah and the condition between the husband and wife, may Allah rectify their relationship.” I was overwhelmed by this great incident. We got up and left. My friend said to me, “You are overwhelmed by this?” I said: “I am amazed.” “By what?” I said: “It was a secret that no one, but God and me knew and he informed me about it.” He said: “Are you doubting the capacity of the Imam? Tell me what the story is?” I told him what had happened and he was also much amazed. Then we returned to Kufa and I went to my house. My wife, who had been angry at me and was living with her family, came and sought my pleasure and apologized to me. She remained very agreeable to me and never disagreed with me until death separated us."

And Abu Faraj Muhammad Ibn ­Muzaffar wrote by his dictation in the house of Abu Ghalib, in the market of Abu Ghalib on Sunday, when five days were left from Dhul Qada of year three hundred and fifty six, saying, I was married to a woman, who was the first woman I had married. I was young man and my age was less than twenty years. I copulated with her at her father’s place and then she stayed there for years. I tried much to convince them to let her move to my place, but they would not listen. The woman became pregnant from me during this time and gave birth to a girl, which lived for a while and then died. I was neither present at her birth, nor when she died, and never saw her, because of the strained relationship between me and my in-laws. Then again we agreed to let her move to my house. So I went to them, but they again declined. I again made the woman pregnant. I demanded them to bring her to my house, as agreed. They again refused and our relationship soured. I moved away from them. She gave birth in my absence to a girl. We remained in this strained condition for many years. I did not go to bring her. Then I went to Baghdad. My friend at that time in Baghdad was Abu Ja’far Muhammad Ibn Ahmad Zajzawzaji and he was like an uncle or father to me. I stayed at his house in Baghdad and complained to him about my strained relationship with my wife and in-laws. He asked me to write a letter and ask for a Dua. So, I wrote a letter and mentioned in it my condition and my sour relations with my wife’s family and their refusal to let my wife come to my house. I and Abu Ja’far took the letter to Muhammad Ibn Ali, who was at the time a contact between us and Husain Ibn Rauh, who was the Representative at that time. We gave him the letter and asked him to send it. He took the letter from me, but the answer did not come for a long while. I met him and told him that I was very uncomfortable with the delay in answer to my letter. He said, “It should not make you uncomfortable.’ He hinted to me that if the answer comes soon, it is from Husain Ibn Rauh, and if there is a delay, it is from the Divine Proof (Hujjah) . I left. After a while – which I do not remember how long, but it was not very long – Abu Ja’far Zajawzaji called me one day. I went to him. He took out a section of a letter and said, “This is the answer of your letter. If you like to copy it, copy it and then return it to me.” I read the letter, which said: “May Allah set right the differences of the husband and the wife.” I copied these words and returned the letter to him. We went to Kufa. God made the woman’s heart soft to me with no effort. She lived with me for many years and I had many children from her. At times I was very rough to her and did things that would require much forbearance from any woman to bear, but she did not utter a word of disagreement, nor did her family, until time separated us from one another.” The narrators say, Abu Ghalib said: Long before this, once I wrote a letter requesting that my orchard and property be accepted. It was not my belief at that time to seek the pleasure of God, but rather I had a desire for courtship with the Naubakhtis, because of the wealth, power and prestige they enjoyed. No reply came to me. I insisted on making my request. A reply came to me, “Choose someone and transfer the property into his name, because you will need it.” I transferred the property to Abul Qasim Musa Ibn Hasan Zajawzaji, the nephew of Abu Ja’far, because I had confidence in him and his piety. Not many days passed that Bedouins took me prisoner and looted the property I owned. All my grains, animals and instruments worth a thousand dinars were gone. I remained in their captivity for some time until I bought my freedom for a hundred dinars and fifteen hundred dirhams. I became indebted to the couriers for another five hundred dirhams. I came out from the captivity and sold the property for this sheer need."

Abu Ali copied the letter and told me that Abul Qasim has suggested to the Imam not to make this epistle public; as he was in the hands of the supporters of Muqtadir in their prison, but he was ordered to disclose it and not to fear and assured that he will be safe. Thus he was freed from the prison a short while after that. Praise be to Allah."

العينين، لقي مولانا أبا الحسن وأبا محمد العسكريين عليهما السلام. وحجب بعد الثمانين، وردت عليه عينـاه قبل وفاته بسبـعة أيـام. وذلك أنـي كنت مقيمـا عنده بمدينة الران من أرض آذربايجان، وكان لا تنقطع توقيعات مولانا صاحب الزمان عليه السلام على يد أبي جعفر محمد بن عثمان العمري وبعده على [يد] أبي القاسم [الحسين] بن روح قدس الله روحهما، فانقطعت عنه المكاتبة نحوا من شهرين، فقلق رحمه الله لذلك. فبينا نحن عنده نأكل إذ دخل البواب مستبشرا، فقال له: فيج العراق لا يسمى بغيره- فاستبشر القاسم وحول وجهه إلى القبلة، فسجد ودخل كهل قصير يرى أثر الفيوج عليه، وعليه جبة مصرية، وفي رجله نعل محاملي، وعلى كتفه مخلاة. فقام القاسم فعانقه ووضع المخلاة عن عنقه، ودعا بطشت وماء فغسل يده وأجلسه إلى جانبه، فأكلنا وغسلنا أيدينا، فقام الرجل فأخرج كتابا أفضل من النصف المدرج ، فناوله القاسم، فأخذه وقبله ودفعه إلى كاتب له يقال له ابن أبي سلمة، فأخذه أبو عبد الله ففضه وقرأه حتى أحس القاسم بنكاية. فقال: يا أبا عبد الله خير، فقال: خير، فقال: ويحك خرج في شئ فقال أبو عبد الله: ما تكره فلا، قال القاسم: فما هو؟ قال: نعي الشيخ إلى نفسه بعد ورود هذا الكتاب بأربعين يوما، وقد حمل إليه سبعة أثواب فقال القاسم: في سلامة من ديني؟ فقال: في سلامة من دينك، فضحك رحمه الله فقال:ما أؤمل بعد هذا العمر. فقال الرجل الوارد: فأخرج من مخلاته ثلاثة أزر وحبرة يمانية حمراء وعمامة وثوبين ومنديلا فأخذه القاسم، وكان عنده قميص خلعه عليه مولانا الرضا أبو الحسن عليه السلام، وكان له صديق يقال له عبد الرحمن بن محمد البدري ، وكان شديد النصب، وكان بينه وبين القاسم نضر الله وجهه مودة في أمور الدنيا شديدة، وكان القاسم يوده، و (قد) كان عبد الرحمن وافى إلى الدار لاصلاح بين أبي جعفر بن حمدون الهمداني وبين ختنة ابن القاسم. فقال القاسم لشيخين من مشايخنا المقيمين معه أحدهما يقال له أبو حامد عمران بن المفلس والآخر أبو علي بن جحدر: أن اقرئا هذا الكتاب عبد الرحمن بن محمد فإني أحب هدايته وأرجو [أن] يهديه الله بقراءة هذا الكتاب، فقالا له: الله الله الله فإن هذا الكتاب لا يحتمل ما فيه خلق من الشيعة فكيف عبد الرحمن بن محمد.فقال: أنا أعلم أني مفش لسر لا يجوز لي إعلانه، لكن من محبتي لعبد الرحمن بن محمد وشهوتي أن يهديه الله عز وجل لهذا الأمر هوذا، إقرأه الكتاب. فلما مر [في] ذلك اليوم- وكان يوم الخميس لثلاث عشرة خلت من رجب- دخل عبد الرحمن بن محمد وسلم عليه، فأخرج القاسم الكتاب فقال له: إقرأ هذا الكتاب وانظر لنفسك، فقرأ عبد الرحمن الكتاب فلما بلغ إلى موضع النعي رمى الكتاب عن يده وقال للقاسم: يا با محمد اتق الله فإنك رجل فاضل في دينك، متمكن من عقلك، والله عز وجل يقول: ﴿وَمَا تَدْرِي نَفْسٌ مَاذَا تَكْسِبُ غَداً وَمَا تَدْرِي نَفْسٌ بِأَيِّ أَرْضٍ تَمُوتُ﴾ .وقال: ﴿عَالِمُ الْغَيْبِ فَلاَ يظْهرُ عَلَى غَيْبِهِ أَحَداً﴾. فضحك القاسم وقال له: أتم الآية: ﴿إِلاَّ مَنِ ارْتَضَى مِنْ رَسُولٍ﴾ ومولاي عليه السلام هو الرضا من الرسول، وقال: قد علمت أنك تقول هذا ولكن أرخ اليوم، فإن أنا عشت بعد هذا اليوم المؤرخ في هذا الكتاب فاعلم أني لست على شئ، وإن أنا مت فانظر لنفسك، فورخ عبد الرحمن اليوم وافترقوا. وحم القاسم يوم السابع من ورود الكتاب، واشتدت به في ذلك اليوم العلة، واستند في فراشه إلى الحائط، وكان ابنه الحسن بن القاسم مدمنا على شرب الخمر، وكان متزوجا إلى أبي عبد الله بن حمدون الهمداني، وكان جالسا ورداؤه مستورعلى وجهه في ناحية من الدار، وأبو حامد في ناحية، وأبو علي بن جحدر وأنا وجماعة من أهل البلد نبكي، إذ اتكى القاسم على يديه إلى خلف وجعل يقول: يا محمد يا علي يا حسن يا حسين يا موالي كونوا شفعائي إلى الله عز وجل وقالها الثانية، وقالها الثالثة. فلما بلغ في الثالثة: يا موسى يا علي تفرقعت أجفان عينيه كما يفرقع الصبيان شقائق النعمان، وانتفخت حدقته، وجعل يمسح بكمه عينيه، وخرج من عينيه شبيه بماء اللحم مد طرفه إلى ابنه، فقال: يا حسن إلي يا با حامد [إلي] يا با علي (إلي)، فاجتمعنا حوله ونظرنا إلى الحدقتين صحيحتين، فقال له أبو حامد: تراني وجعل يده على كل واحد منا، وشاع الخبر في الناس والعامة، و(انتابه) الناس من العوام ينظرون إليه. وركب القاضي إليه وهو أبو السائب عتبة بن عبيد الله المسعودي وهو قاضي القضاة ببغداد ، فدخل عليه فقال له: يا با محمد ما هذا الذي بيدي وأراه خاتما فصه فيروزج، فقربه منه فقال:عليه ثلاثة أسطر فتناوله القاسم رحمه الله فلم يمكنه قراءته وخرج الناس متعجبين يتحدثون بخبره، والتفت القاسم إلى ابنه الحسن فقال له: إن الله منزلك منزلة ومرتبك مرتبة فاقبلها بشكر، فقال له الحسن: يا أبه قد قبلتها، قال القاسم: على ماذا؟ قال:على ما تأمرني به يا أبه، قال: على أن ترجع عما أنت عليه من شرب الخمر، قال الحسن: يا أبه وحق من أنت في ذكره لأرجعن عن شرب الخمر، ومع الخمر أشياء لا تعرفها، فرفع القاسم يده إلى السماء وقال: اللهم ألهم الحسن طاعتك، وجنبه معصيتك ثلاث مرات، ثم دعا بدرج فكتب وصيته بيده رحمه الله وكانت الضياع التي في يده لمولانا وقف وقفه (أبوه). وكان فيما أوصى الحسن أن قال: يا بني إن أهلت لهذا الأمر يعني الوكالة لمولانا فيكون قوتك من نصف ضيعتي المعروفة بفرجيذه، وسائرها ملك لمولاي، وإن لم تؤهل له فاطلب خيرك من حيث يتقبل الله، وقبل الحسن وصيته على ذلك.فلما كان في يوم الأربعين وقد طلع الفجر مات القاسم رحمه الله، فوافاه عبد الرحمن يعدو في الأسواق حافيا حاسرا وهو يصيح:وا سيداه، فاستعظم الناس ذلك منه وجعل الناس يقولون: ما الذي تفعل بنفسك، فقال: اسكنوا فقد رأيت ما لم تروه، وتشيع ورجع عما كان عليه، ووقف الكثير من ضياعه. وتولى أبو علي بن جحدر غسل القاسم وأبو حامد يصب عليه الماء، وكفن في ثمانية أثواب على بدنه قميص مولاه أبي الحسن وما يليه السبعة الأثواب التي جاءته من العراق. فلما كان بعد مدة يسيرة ورد كتاب تعزية على الحسن من مولانا عليه السلام في آخره دعاء ""ألهمك الله طاعته وجنبك معصيته"" وهو الدعاء الذي كان دعا به أبوه، وكان آخره ""قد جعلنا أباك إماما لك وفعاله لك مثالا"".","H 263 - Narrated to me Muhammad bin Muhammad bin Noman (Shaykh Mufeed) and Husain bin Ubaidullah from Muhammad bin Ahmad Safwani that: “I had seen Qasim Ibn Ala, who lived for a hundred and seventeen years, and till he was eighty, his eyesight was intact. He had met our Master Abul Hasan Askari and Abu Muhammad Askari . At eighty, he lost his eyesight. However, it was returned to him seven days before his death. This happened when I was staying with him in the town of Ran in Azerbaijan. Letters were constantly coming from our master, the Master of the Age through Abu Ja’far Muhammad Ibn Uthman Amari and after him through Abul Qasim Husain Ibn Rauh, blessed be their souls. Then for two months the letters stopped. This made him angry. We were eating with him one day, when the doorman came, bringing the joyous news and said that the messenger of Iraq, the only name by which he was identified with, has come. Qasim became much happy and turned to Qibla and prostrated. A short old man, who bore marks of messengers, wearing an Egyptian dress and special shoes and having a bag over his shoulder, came in. Qasim arose and hugged him and took off the bag from his shoulder. He asked for a basin and water, washed his hands and led him to sit on his side. We ate and washed our hands. The man rose and took out a letter that was longer than half of page. Qasim took the letter, kissed it and handed it over to a transcriber called Ibn Abi Salama. Abu Abdullah took the letter, broke its seal, and read it. As he read it, Qasim sensed something. He asked: “Abu Abdullah; is everything all right?” He replied, “It is alright.” “Watch it you. Is there anything written about me?” “Not something you dislike.” “Then what is it’?” “It the news of your final departure, forty days after the arrival of this letter. And seven garments are sent to you.” Qasim asked, “With my faith secure?” He replied, “With your faith secure.” He laughed and said: “What else can I hope for after this age’?” The messenger took out three undergarments, one red Yemeni cloak, two shirts, and a turban. Qasim took them. He also had a garment that our Master Imam Ridha Abul Hasan had given to him. Qasim had a friend called Abdur Rahman Ibn Muhammad Sunaizi, who was a Sunni and had very strict religious views. There was a very strong affinity between him and Qasim in ordinary matters and Qasim loved him very much. Abdur Rahman had undertaken some toils to reconcile Abu Ja’far Ibn Hamdun Hamadani and his son-in-law, the son of Qasim. Considering this, Qasim asked two of our Shaykhs who were staying with him – Abu Hamid Imran Ibn Muflis and Abu Ali Ibn Jahdar – to read this letter to Abdur Rahman Ibn Muhammad, “because I love him to be guided and I hope that Allah will guide him by reading this letter.” The two Shaykhs replied, “La ilaha illa Allah. Many Shia cannot bear the content of this letter. How do you expect that Abdul Rahman Ibn Muhammad will?” Qasim replied, “I know that I am disclosing a secret that is not permissible for me to disclose. However, due to my love for Abdur Rahman Ibn Muhammad and my desire that Allah, the Exalted, may guide him to this faith, it is that I want you to read this letter to him.” When that day passed, and it was Thursday and thirteen days were left from Rajab, Abdur­ Rahman came and greeted Qasim. Qasim took out the letter and asked his guest to read it, “and look for yourself.” Abdur Rahman read the letter and when he reached where Qasim’s death had been predicted, he threw the letter from his hand and said to Qasim, “Abu Muhammad, fear God. You are a pious man, you are wise. Allah says: “…and no one knows what he shall earn on the morrow; and no one knows in what land he shall die…” (31:34) And He says: “The Knower of the unseen! So He does not reveal His secrets to any.” (72:26) Qasim laughed and said: “Read the next verse also: “Except to him whom He chooses as an apostle...” (72:27) And my Master is a well-pleased messenger.” Qasim said: “I know what you are saying. Mark today’s date. If I outlive the date predicted in this letter, my creed is false and if I die on that date, then you assess your condition.” Abdur Rahman noted the date and left. Qasim got a fever seven days after the arrival of the letter. On that day, his malady worsened. He was lying on his bed on the side of the wall. His son Hasan, who was an alcoholic and was married to the daughter of Abu Ja’far Ibn Hamadan Hamadani, was sitting. Qasim’s sheet was covering his face, as he was lying in one side of the room. Abu Hamid was sitting on one side, as Abu Ali Ibn Jahdar and I and a group of other men of the locality were crying. Suddenly, Qasim rose and sat resting on his hands on his back and said, “O Muhammad, O Ali, O Hasan, O Husain, O my Masters, be my intercessors before God, the Exalted.” He said this again and then a third time. When he reached the third time, saying, “O Musa, O Ali,” his eyelid popped open like children crack windflowers. His eyes opened and he rubbed them with his sleeves. A soupy fluid came out from his eyes. Then he glanced at his son and said: “O Hasan.” He looked at each one of us and was saying, “O Abu Hamid, O Abu Ali.” We crowded around him and looked at his perfect eyeballs. Abu Hamid asked, “Can you see me?” as he was pointing at each of us. The news spread amongst the people and Ahle Sunnat. Individuals from Ahle Sunnat started coming and examining him. The judge, Abu Saib Ataba Ibn Ubaidullah Masudi, who was the chief justice at Baghdad, came and met Qasim and asked, “What is in my hand?” as he was showing him a ring the stone of which was turquoise. He brought the ring near. Qasim told him what it had and said it has three lines. The judge brought it closer, but he could not read the lines. People left as they were amazed at him and talking about him. Qasim said to his son Hasan, “Allah will grant you a great position, so accept it with gratitude.” Hasan said: “Father, I accept it.” Qasim said: “How?” “As you order me father.” He said: “Give up drinking.” Hasan said: “You are right father. I will give it up and many other things you don’t know about.” Qasim raised his hands to the sky and said: “God, cast Your obedience into Hasan’s heart and prevent him from sins.” He said this three times. Then he asked for a paper and wrote his final will in his own hands. He endowed the orchards and properties he owned to our Master. Amongst the things he confided in his final will to his son Hasan, was “My son, if you become eligible for this position [meaning representation from the Master], your livelihood should be from the half of my bequeathals in Farjida. The rest of them will belong to my Master. If you were not eligible for this, seek your goodness from a venue that Allah desires.” Hasan accepted his final will. Qasim died on the fortieth day after dawn. Abdur Rahman received the news of his departure with great grief and he was running in the streets barefoot and bare head, screaming, “O my master!” People viewed his actions as odd and asked him, “What are you doing?” He said, “Quiet. I have seen what you have not.” Abdur Rahman became a Shia and forsook his previous creed. He left his orchards and properties as endowments. Abu Ali Ibn Jahdar gave Qasim his funeral bath as Abu Hamid poured water. Qasim was shrouded in eight dresses, with the shirt of his Master Abul Hasan on his body and the other seven that came from Iraq over them. A short while after that, a letter of consolation came to his son from our Master , at the end of which was a Dua for him, “May God cast His obedience into your heart and may He prevent you from sins,” the Dua his father had prayed for him. At the end it stated, “We made your father an Imam for you and his actions an example for you.”"

Hasan bin Ali Wajna Naseebi arrived with Muhammad bin Fadhl Mosuli, who was a Shia, but who didn’t believe in the deputyship of Husain bin Rauh. So, he said: The amount paid to Abul Qasim is not rightful [it is not a legal expense and it does not reach the rightful]. Hasan bin Ali Wajna said to Muhammad bin Fadhl: Fear Allah, because the authenticity of deputyship of Abul Qasim Husain bin Rauh is like the authenticity of deputyship of Abu Ja’far Muhammad bin Uthman Amari. One day both of them arrived in Baghdad and stayed at the house of Zahiri. We also went to meet and welcome them. One of our senior teachers and elders, Abul Hasan bin Zafar or Abul Qasim bin Azhar was also present there. An argument arose between Muhammad bin Fadhl and Hasan bin Ali. Muhammad bin Fadhl said: What proof do you have in support of the deputyship of Husain bin Rauh? Hasan bin Ali Wajna said: I will get you such a proof that it would definitely convince you. Muhammad bin Fadhl had a huge register with green pages and its cover was black. He recorded his accounts in it. Hasan bin Ali took the register and cut out a page half of which was white and said to Muhammad bin Fadhl: Sharpen a quill for me. Muhammad sharpened a pen for him and both of them decided on a matter, which I don’t know what it was, but Abul Hasan bin Zafar was informed about it. Hasan bin Ali Wajna took the pen and pretended to write the matter, which they had decided, but nothing showed on the paper. When the paper was full, but apparently it was white and blank, he placed the seal and gave it to the black servant of Muhammad bin Fadhl and sent it to Abul Qasim Husain bin Rauh. Ibn Wajna remained with us there. When it was time for Zuhr prayer we prayed there only. After the prayers the messenger returned arrived and announced: He said: Go, the reply will follow. Food was served. We were eating when the reply arrived written on that same sheet of paper. Each of the issues mentioned in that letter were replied systematically [about which no one except those two knew]. Seeing this, Muhammad bin Fadhl slapped his face and lost all appetite. After that he said to Ibn Wajna: Come with me. Ibn Wajna arose and joined him till they came to Abul Qasim Husain bin Rauh and weeping and wailing said: Master, forgive me; may Almighty Allah forgive you. Abul Qasim said: Allah, the Mighty and the High will forgive us and you, if Allah wills."

[قال:] فأخذت ذلك وحفظته وانصرف الرسول، وإذا أنا بالمشاعل على بابي والباب يدق، فقلت لغلامي خير:يا خير أنظر أي شئ هو ذا؟ فقال: هذا غلام حميد بن محمد الكاتب ابن عم الوزير فأدخله إلي، فقال لي: قد طلبك الوزير ويقول لك مولاي حميد: اركب إلي. [قال:] فركبت وفتحت الشوارع والدروب [وجئت] إلى شارع الوزانين، فإذا بحميد قاعد ينتظرني، فلما رآني أخذ بيدي وركبنا فدخلنا على الوزير، فقال لي الوزير: يا شيخ قد قضى الله حاجتك، واعتذر إلي ودفع إلي الكتب مكتوبة مختومة قد فرغ منها، قال:فأخذت ذلك وخرجت. قال: وقال أبو محمد الحسن بن محمد:فحدثنا أبو الحسن علي بن أحمد العقيقي بنصيبين بهذا وقال لي:ما خرج هذا الحنوط إلا إلى عمتي فلانة فلم يسمها وقد نعيت إلي نفسي، وقد قال لي الحسين بن روح رحمه الله:إني أملك الضيعة وقد كتب لي بالذي أردت فقمت إليه وقبلت رأسه وعينيه وقلت له:يا سيدي أرني الأكفان والحنوط والدراهم، قال: فاخرج لي الأكفان، فإذا فيه برد حبر مسهم من نسج اليمن وثلاثة أثواب مروي وعمامة وإذا الحنوط في خريطة، فأخرج الدراهم فوزنها مائة درهم وعددها مائة درهم.فقلت له:يا سيدي هب لي منها درهما أصوغه خاتما، فقال (و) كيف يكون ذلك، خذ من عندي ما شئت، فقلت:أريد من هذه وألححت عليه وقبلت رأسه (وعينيه)، فأعطاني درهما شددته في منديلي وجعلته في كمي.فلما صرت إلى الخان فتحت زنفيلجة معي، وجعلت المنديل في الزنفيلجة وفيه الدرهم مشدود، وجعلت كتبي ودفاتري (فيها) وأقمت أياما ثم جئت أطلب الدرهم فإذا الصرة مصرورة بحالها ولا شئ فيها، فأخذني شبه الوسواس، فصرت إلى باب العقيقي، فقلت لغلامه خير، أريد الدخول إلى الشيخ، فأدخلني إليه فقال لي: مالك يا سيدي؟ فقلت: الدرهم الذي أعطيتني ما أصبته في الصرة، فدعا بزنفيلجة وأخرج الدراهم فإذا هي مائة عددا ووزنا، ولم يكن معي أحد اتهمه فسألته رده إلي، ثم خرج إلى مصر وأخذ الضيعة، ومات قبله محمد بن إسماعيل بعشرة كما قيل ثم توفي رحمه الله وكفن في الأكفان التي دفعت إليه.,"H 265 - Narrated to us a group of scholars from Abu Ja’far Muhammad bin Ali bin Husain bin Babawayh that he said: Narrated to us Abu Muhammad Hasan Ibn Muhammad Ibn Yahya Alawi, the nephew of Tahir, in Baghdad on the side of the cotton market in his house that: Abul Hasan Ali Ibn Ahmad Ibn Ali Aqiqi came to Baghdad in the year two hundred and ninety eight and went to Ali Ibn Isa Jarrah, who was at that time the minister, to seek help about something he had lost. He asked the minister for help. But he said, “You have a big family in this region. If we go to them, they will give us everything we ask for.” This took very long or he gave this answer. So, Aqiqi said, “I will ask someone who can fulfill my need.” Ali Ibn Isa asked, “And who is that?” He said: “Allah, the Exalted.” Saying this, he left angrily. He said: I went out as I was saying, “To God is the call of help from every calamity and in Him is relief from every tragedy.” As I went away, a messenger from Husain Ibn Rauh came and I confided my misgivings to him. The messenger brought it to the attention of Husain Ibn Rauh. He then came with a hundred dirhams, whole in number and weight, a scarf, some anointments for the deceased and some burial shrouds. He said: “Your master is extending his greetings to you and is saying, ‘When a grief or hard event challenges you, touch this scarf against your face, for this is the scarf of your master. And take these dirhams, anointments and burial shrouds. Your need will be fulfilled tonight. When you reach Egypt, Muhammad Ibn Ismail will be dead ten days before your arrival and you will die after him. So, this will be your burial shroud, this, your scent and this, your gear.” I took the items and put the event into my memory. The messenger left. Once I noticed that the torch at my door was alight and someone was knocking the door. I asked my servant, “Look, what is it?” He said: “It is alright. It is the slave of Hamid Ibn Muhammad Katib, the cousin of the minister.” He brought him to me. He said: “The minister wants to see you. My master Hamid is asking you to ride to him.” I rode and passed by the streets gates and reached the street of the weight-makers. I saw Hamid waiting there for me. When he saw me, he held my hand and we rode to the minister. The minister said: “O Shaykh, Allah has fulfilled your need.” He apologized to me and gave letters that were written and sealed and he had made them ready for me. I took the letters and left. Abu Muhammad Hasan Ibn Muhammad says, Abul Hasan Ali Ibn Ahmad Aqiqi narrated this to us in Nasibayn and said: These anointments did not come, but for my aunt. [He did not mention her name.] That is the news of my death was given. Husain Ibn Rauh had told me: You will own agricultural land and after that he wrote my request. So, I went to him, kissed his forehead and eyes and said: “Master, show me the burial shrouds, the anointments and the dirhams.” He took out the shrouds. There was an embroidered cloak in them weaved at Yemen, three garments from Khurasan and a turban. The anointments were in a sack. He took out the dirhams. I counted them. They were one hundred. I said: “Master, give me one dirham from them, I will make a ring out of it.” He said: “How can that be? Take anything else you want?” I begged and entreated that I wanted a dirham from those dirhams. I kissed his head and his eyes. He gave me a dirham, which I fastened in my handkerchief and then put it in my sleeve. When I went to the inn, I opened the long sack which I had and put the handkerchief, in which the dirham was tied, in the long sack. I put my books and notebooks over it. I stayed some days and then came back to get the dirham. The sack was tied as it had been, but nothing was in it. Different thoughts were ravaging through my head. I went to the door of Aqiqi and said to his servant, Khair, “I want to see the Shaykh.” He took me inside. He asked: “What is happening?” I said: “My master, the dirham which you gave me, I did not put it in my sack.” He called for his sack and took out the dirhams and counted them: they were one hundred by number and weight. There was no one with me, who I would suspect of wrongdoing. I asked him to give it back to me. But then he went to Egypt and took possession of his agricultural lands. And as predicted Muhammad Ibn Ismail had died ten days before him and then he died and was shrouded in the burial shrouds he was given."

You should know that the Almighty Allah does not speak to the people directly. But He sends some prophets to them. If He had sent non-humans as prophets, they would not have gathered near him, they would have shunned him. That is why the prophets were from human beings. They ate like humans and walked the streets and bazaars. People used to say: You are like us and we are like you. We do not accept that you are a prophet, but that you present some miracle. If you show a miracle, we would know that you have a special distinction from Allah, which we don’t have. Thus the miracles of the prophets are the greatest proof of the veracity of their claims. Therefore, some of them after warnings and completion of proof, presented the miracle of the flood and storm and the arrogants were drowned. Some were such that when thrown into the fire, it became cool and comfort for them. For some of them the sea split and the enemies drowned in it. The Almighty Allah turned the dry staff into a python. Of them were such through whose hands the Almighty enlivened the dead and for some split the moon and in the same way gave speech to animals like camel and wolf, etc. In other words, the divine prophets presented such miracles that people were not capable of performing them. The wisdom of the Almighty was such that the prophets, though they possessed miracles, sometimes they were victorious and sometimes suffered defeat. If they had always been victorious and had never suffered defeat and calamities the people would have mistaken them for being gods and considered them all-powerful. Thus the prophets, despite their miracles were sometimes victorious and successful and sometimes vanquished, therefore the people did not perceive them to be omnipotent and realized that there was a power above the prophets; that is the creator and nourisher of the Universe? They were compelled to confess to Him and obey His prophets, who are the proofs of Allah over the people. Anyone who saw their propagation, warnings and signs decided and confessed that it was truth and worth obedience. In this way they secured their salvation and those who deviated from this and became inimical to the divine messengers fell into everlasting chastisement. So: that he who would perish might perish by clear proof, and he who would live might live by clear proof.’” Muhammad bin Ibrahim bin Ishaq says that the reply of Husain bin Rauh was so astonishing that the next day he went to him to ask him whether it was his own reply or he had learnt it from the Infallible Imam . Husain bin Rauh told him: “O Muhammad bin Ibrahim! I never say anything on my own even in the most difficult circumstances. Rather the source of everything is the favors I have received from the Proof of Allah and heard from him...”"

These reports mention unseen matters and prophesize future events in an extraordinary manner, such that no one had any knowledge about them, except that Allah, the Mighty and the High may have bestowed him through the knowledge of His Prophet and these reports reached him through one whose veracity was testified beyond any doubt. Like for example, Husain bin Rauh. If his veracity had not been there, he would not have been as such [that he would not have had knowledge of unseen], because these miracles are never possible through liars. The conclusion is that when the veracity of the deputies of Imam is proved, it also proves the existence of one through whom they are getting these blessings.

The reply is that the prevention of his killing by the Almighty Allah is of two kinds: One is that this obstacle should either be in negation of religious duties or not opposed to it. And that obstacle, which is not opposed to religious duties, is that opposition to Imam should be prohibited; his obedience and following should be ordered and help should be rendered to him and to say that it is obligatory for people to obey him. All these commands and prohibitions are also issued by Almighty Allah, but becoming an obstacle by Allah for one who intends to kill the Imam is opposed to religious duties and logical contradictions appear in it. It is so, because religious duties are aimed at earning divine rewards, but Allah’s being an obstacle is opposed to this and on many occasions, compulsive prevention by the Almighty Allah may have some evil for the people, which in fact cannot be expected from Allah. One of our senior scholars said that the instance of malaise in the reappearance of the Imam and the instance of exigency in his occultation is not impossible and improbable; on the contrary it is very much possible. But this statement is not correct, because from this statement, the obligatoriness of messengership would become invalid [that is if this is accepted, it would be right to say that the sending of prophets is not right]. In the same way, the result of accepting this statement would be that messengership and prophethood is a divine grace, but it can be changed depending on circumstances. [That it is possible for prophethood to be necessary at a time and unnecessary at another; whereas prophethood and messengership is necessary and obligatory at all times.] However, becoming an obstacle of the Almighty Allah between the Imam and people as we have mentioned [that is through occultation of the Imam] there is no problem in it and it is also not impossible, that it should be said that there is an evil in this occultation, but from this occultation the obligatoriness of appointment of the Imamate does not end and it is also not in contradiction to Imamate."

We would reply: The circumstances of the forefathers of Imam Mahdi were different, because they acted according to dissimulation (Taqayyah) with the rulers of their times and acted with them in such a way that even the rulers knew that they would not stage an uprising and the Holy Imams also did not see any exigency in staging an uprising. On the contrary, the circumstances of the lives of the Holy Imams show that these personages were also in anticipation of the Mahdi and those who had faith in their Imamate also did not cause any loss to the regimes of their times [it was so, because the Holy Imams were not commanded to stage an uprising]. But the matter of Imam Mahdi is not like this. It is so, because it is known from the circumstances of the Imam that he would stage an armed uprising and finish off the tyrant regimes from the world and subdue all the tyrant rulers and wave the standard of justice and equity on the whole world and destroy injustice and oppression. Thus, if someone is having this quality then certainly the rulers of his time would be terrified and be inimical to him and would pursue him and send spies to observe all his movements; and they would be terrified of this all the time. In such circumstances, Imam needs to keep himself away and in occultation from the people, till the time of his reappearance; from those from whom he perceives danger, whether they are friends or enemies. In addition to what is mentioned, the forefathers of Imam Mahdi were apparent and not in occultation, because if death or martyrdom occurred for them they knew well that after them one of their issues would be the successor, but such a thing is not there for Imam Mahdi . It is so, because if an event like martyrdom occurs before the uprising, there is no one who can be his successor; therefore it was necessary for Imam Mahdi to be in occultation and circumstances of Imam are completely different from those of his forefathers and this matter is absolutely clear. If it is said: How can we understand that it is time of his reappearance and the danger to his life is no more? Can it be through divine revelation, whereas there is no revelation on Imam ? Or through definite knowledge, which does not require contemplation and consideration? It is also clear and obvious that it is opposed to religious duty. Or through Amara and a sign, which becomes a conjecture for him? It is also harmful to the life of the Imam and it casts his life into danger."

The Imam also with regard to that which he was informed and that which was ordered to him is following his respected forefathers and the Messenger of Allah (s), but due to exigencies this matter was concealed from us, but the Imam himself, since he is cognizant of these matters, he does not need to refer to Amara and the signs. Secondly, if we suppose that Imam acts according to his conjecture at the time of reappearance, it is possible that it is very much possible that the conjecture of Imam is helped through Amara and signs that he has received the necessary power for rulership. So at that time he would reappear and the Imam is also aware of it that when he gains strong conjecture, it would be the time of his reappearance. On the basis of this, strong conjecture is a condition of reappearance and it makes reappearance necessary. Thus, in jurisprudence we say that the order of the judge is issued on the testimony of a witness, or that on the basis of Amara and conjecture it is commanded to pray in all four directions. And this matter is absolutely clear, praise be to Allah. On the basis of this principle, traditional reports are mentioned, which help in our claim and we mention a few of them over here so that we may develop more interest in this topic, if Allah, the Almighty wills."

Ahmad Ibn Ishaq made a gesture to me to ask him about the successor. So, I asked him, “O Abu Amr, I want to ask you a question; however, I am not unsure about what I want to ask you, for my faith and belief is that the earth does not remain without a Divine Proof (Hujjah), unless it is forty days prior to Judgment Day. And when that happens, the Divine Proof (Hujjah) is raised up and the gateway of repentance is shut. And it will not benefit any soul has it not already believed and earned good in its belief. They are the wicked of God’s creation and they are the ones that Judgment Day shall stand against. However, I desire to increase my certitude, as Ibrahim asked his Lord to show him how He brings the dead back to life. He said: ‘Do you believe not? He said: Indeed; rather, for my heart to satisfy. Abu Ali Ahmad Ibn Ishaq has narrated to me from Abul Hasan . He said: I asked the Imam, ‘With whom should I transact and from whom should I learn and whose word should I accept?’ The Imam said: Amari is my trustworthy man. Whatever he delivers to you, he does so from me. And whatever he says to you, he does so from me. So listen to him and obey him, for he is a trustworthy and honest man.’ Also Abu Ali narrated to me that he asked Abu Muhammad Hasan Ibn Ali the same question and the Imam said: Amari and his son are two trustworthy men. Whatever they deliver to you, they deliver from me; and whatever they say to you, they say from me. Listen to them and obey them, for they are two trustworthy and honest men.’ These are the words of two Imams of the past about you.” Abu Amr fell into prostration and tears rolled down his eyes and then he said: “Ask.” I asked, “Have you seen the successor of Imam Hasan Askari ?” He said: “Yes, by Allah. And his neck is like this,” and he gestured. I said, “I have one more question.” He said: “Bring it forth.” I said: “His name?” He said: “That is forbidden to you to ask about. I am not saying this from myself, nor am I permitted to allow or disallow. Rather, this prohibition is from the Imam himself . The ruler’s impression is that Imam Hasan Askari passed away and did not leave a son behind and that his bequeathals were divided and taken over by persons who were not entitled to. He was patient on that. There is his household, wandering about and there is no one who has the courage to recognize them or offer them something. Should the name come out, search will be on. So fear God and hold back from that.”"

We were informed about this letter and its matter and all these are our replies. Not a single letter belongs to the condemned, deviated and the deviating one. Before this, some points reached you through Ahmad bin Hilal and other people like him, but all of them also apostasied like Shalmaghani and may Allah send chastisement on them. The inquirer wrote at the end: I have had this verified before also. Thus, in its reply it was mentioned that the epistle that was verified to you if you have received the same from those people, there is no harm in it; and it is correct.” And regarding some scholars of Ahle Bayt , it is an old practice that they were asked in the same manner about someone who was condemned by Allah. So they replied that knowledge is with us and whoever denies it may continue to do so. How does it affect you? If you receive some traditional report through him, which has been verified by your authorities, you must thank Allah and accept it and that in which you doubt or that traditional report, which has reached you through a trustworthy authority, you must refer to us about it.

May the Almighty Allah grant you honor and help you and may He continue to send His blessings and increase blessings on you. May He send you the best care and if some harm is going to reach you, may it come to us. People want to compete with each other in seeking proximity and honor, but whoever you accept is acceptable and whoever you reject will be degraded. We seek Allah’s refuge from this. May Allah bless you. May the Almighty Allah support you. Our city also has a group of generous and responsible citizens, who compete with each other for divine proximity. And may the Almighty Allah support him. Some people received his letter in which he ordered that they should help Saad and Ali Ibn Muhammad Ibn Husain Ibn Malik, who is known as Baduka and the Khatan [son-in-law] of Saad; his name was not among those whom he has indicated. Therefore, he is aggrieved due to this and has requested me to mention his displeasure to you. If his name is absent because of some sin of his, he should seek forgiveness of the same and if it is due to some other reason, he should mention it and seek means of solace. Epistle: We correspond only with our regular correspondents. [continuation of the letter] May Almighty Allah bless you, you have made me habituated to your kindness, thus you and jurisprudents before you are more eligible that the Almighty Allah should increase your honor. I have some questions. Please ask him on my behalf. It is narrated to us from Imam Kadhim that he was asked: An Imam of the congregation was leading the prayers and during the prayers something happened to him and he died. So what should the people do? Epistle: He will be moved to the rear and a person from the followers will step forward and complete the prayer and the one who has touched the deceased Imam will perform the bath (Ghusl) of touching the dead. Those who moved him to the rear should only wash their hands and if no invalidator has occurred, the same Imam will complete the prayers with the people. Question: Also it is narrated from Imam Musa Kadhim that one who touches a corpse when it has yet to cool down, he should wash his hands and if he has touched it after it has cooled, the bath (Ghusl) of touching the dead (Mayyit) becomes obligatory on him and this Imam of congregation will definitely have some warmth remaining and thus he will be touched in that condition only, so only washing of the hands will be required. And most probably he will be lifted along with his clothes so how can bath (Ghusl) of touching the dead become obligatory on him? Epistle: When the dead is touched while warmth remains in it, one just has to wash the hands and that is all. Question: If a person reciting Prayer of Ja’far Tayyar forgets the recitation in standing, sitting, bowing or prostrating; and recalls it later; should he recite it at that point? Or leave it and go ahead? Epistle: When he has forgotten in some of these conditions and he recalled it in the same prayer, he should do it when he remembers. Question: A husband of a woman has died; can she participate in his last rites? Epistle: Yes, she can. Question: Can she visit the grave of the husband during Iddah (waiting period)? Epistle: Yes, but she must spend the nights at her home. Question: Can she go out of her house to fulfill an obligatory duty or she must stay the period of Iddah at home? Epistle: She may fulfill any duty incumbent on her. On the contrary, even if she has a need she can leave the house; but she must spend the nights at her home. Question: It is narrated from Imam Musa Kadhim regarding the rewards of reciting the Quran during obligatory prayers that he said: I am surprised at one who does not recite Surah Qadr in his prayer. How can his prayer be accepted and it is mentioned in another report that the prayer of one who does not recite Surah Ikhlas in it cannot be purified. It is mentioned in another report that one who recites Surah Humazah will be rewarded equal to the world. Now the question is: Is it allowed to recite Surah Humazah and leave the other chapters, whereas it is mentioned in traditional reports that his prayer will not be accepted or his prayer will not be purified? Epistle: The reward mentioned in traditional reports for recitation of Surahs is correct, but if one leaves them and recites Surah Ikhlas and Surah Qadr, about which report has come down, he will get the reward of the Surah he has recited and also he will get the reward of the Surah he has left. It is also allowed to leave other Surahs, although his prayer will be correct; only that he should have left it for a preferable deed. Question: When is the farewell to the month of Ramadhan? There is difference of opinion among our associates. Some say that the supplication of the farewell to the month of Ramadhan should be recited on its last night. Some say it should be recited after sighting the moon of Shawwal. Epistle: The Aamaal of Ramadhan are performed in its nights, therefore the supplication of farewell to the month of Ramadhan will be on its last night, although if one fears that there would be deficiency, one should recite on last two nights. Question: “Most surely it is the Word of an honored messenger…” (81:19) It implies the Messenger of Allah (s). “The processor of strength, having an honorable place with the Lord of the Dominion. One (to be) obeyed, and faithful in trust.” (81:20-21) And what the power is and what that being is and where it is? May Allah, the Mighty and Sublime exalt your honor, please ask these questions to a trustworthy jurisprudent and inform me and also write in detail about Muhammad bin Husain bin Malik so that he may be satisfied and pray for the well being of the world and the hereafter from me and the brothers. Epistle: May the Almighty Allah gather the good of the world and the hereafter for you and your brothers. May Allah maintain your honor, help you and be kind to you and may He complete His favor on you and if some harm is to reach you, may it come to me instead. And praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds and may Allah bless Muhammad and his progeny, all of them."

Because some of our scholars say that it is not obligatory, on the contrary he is allowed to say Bihawlillaahi Quwwatihi aqoomo wa aqud. Reply: There are two traditions in this connection: the first is that when the worshipper lifts his head from Sajdah he recites the Takbir, then he sits and then he stands up; thus he does not need to recite the Takbir for standing up after sitting. The same is with the case of the first Tashahud. One can choose any of the options. Question: Also please inquire if one can pray wearing a ring of Hadid? Reply: It is detestable (Makruh). Question: A person bought a sacrificial animal on behalf of a person who was not present as the latter had told him to sacrifice in Mina on his behalf; but when he wanted to slaughter the animal, he forgot the name of that person and he remembered it only after the sacrifice; is it a proper procedure for the person who delegated the ritual? Reply: There is no problem; the sacrifice was complete. Question: There are some Majusi weavers among us who eat carrion and don’t perform bath (Ghusl) of Janabat; can we pray in the clothes weaved by them without purifying them? Reply: There is no problem in it. Question: A person is reciting Midnight Prayers in dark; when he goes into Sajdah, his forehead falls on something other than the place of prostration; that is the floor etc. Now when he raises his head, he finds the Turbah; does he have to count that Sajdah? Reply: Till he does not sit upright, he can raise his head to search for the Turbah. Question: A person who is wearing Ihram removes the covering of the canopy, but leaves the frame. Is it allowed? Reply: There is no problem if he leaves the frame. One of the things a person in Ihram has to avoid is shade. Thus, if he rides a camel with a canopy or a bus with roof, he has to pay the Penalty (Kaffarah) of sacrificing a sheep, but if the covering of the canopy or the bus is removed, leaving the frame and walls, there is no problem in it. Question: If a person wearing Ihram shades himself with a sack or with something else to protect himself or his seat from getting soaked in rain, is it allowed for him to do so? Reply: If he does this on the way with canopy, the Kaffarah is obligatory on him. The penalty of a goat is due to the fact that the person has shaded himself from rain and to shade oneself is an omission for a person in Ihram. Question: Is it necessary for a person doing Hajj as proxy, to mention the name of the one whose Hajj he is doing at the time of Ihram? Is it obligatory that he must make separate sacrifice for himself as well as whose Hajj he is performing? Reply: It is not necessary to recite it in detail and one sacrifice is sufficient on behalf of the one whose Hajj he is performing. Question: Is it permitted for man to tie up the Ihram with a sheet of fur? Reply: There is no problem; righteous and decent people have dressed (been Muhrim) in it. Question: Is it permitted for man to keep with himself an iron knife or an iron key while praying? Reply: It is allowed. Question: A man goes for Hajj with a group of Sunnis and they do not put on the Ihram at Maslakh. Whether this man is allowed to delay his Ihram till Zaat-e-Arq so that he becomes Muhrim with them at that place? Reply: It is necessary to become Muhrim from the Miqaat and say the Thalbiya softly and when he reaches the Miqaat with them, he should make it obvious. Question: How is wearing leather slippers, because people say that it is Makruh to wear them? Reply: It is permissible and there is no problem. Question: A man is a treasurer in endowments and he is careless. He considers as permissible for himself the endowments, which are under his control, and he does not abstain from them. Often when I enter his office and he is present or I enter his house and he is present, he invites me to eat and if I don’t eat at his place, he would become inimical to me and say: such and such has not considered my food lawful. Now please tell me if it is allowed for me to eat with him and then later pay Sadaqah for it. And how much Sadaqah should I pay? Or whether it is allowed for me to accept a gift from him? Reply: If this man is having other property in addition to the endowments he holds and has other occupations as well, you may eat with him and accept his gifts. If it is not so, you must neither eat at his place nor accept any gift from him. Question: A man is a Shia and considers Mutah and temporary marriage permissible and also believes in the Rajat (return) and all his family members are united. This man has made a vow that he would neither take a second wife nor do Mutah. And he has spent 19 years with this vow. Now if he breaks his vow, does he become liable for a penalty or sin? Reply: It is Mustahab (recommended) for him to do Mutah at least once for obedience of Allah, so that the sin of the vow is removed from him. [This letter is followed by the discourse of Husain bin Rauh as follows:] Thus if you consider it proper, may Almighty Allah strengthen your honor, ask these questions from Imam and leave their explanation for me and write to me the command in each issue and leave your favor on me. May the Almighty Allah deem you as the channel of all good and may He issue it through you. If you do this, you would have performed a preferred and a rewardable act. May Almighty Allah give you a long life, may He preserve your respect and good fortune and complete His bounties on you and may He increase His favors on you. May He deem me your ransom in every calamity and may He fix my death before you. All praise is from the Lord of the worlds and exceeding benedictions be on His Messenger, Prophet Muhammad (s) and his family."

I saw him one day in the house of Ibn Yasar. He had a great position before the Sayyid and the caliph. The Ahle Sunnat people also revered him. Abul Qasim attended that place due to dissimulation (Taqayyah) and fear. I remember him. Two men were arguing; one was claiming that Abu Bakr was the best of the people after the Messenger of Allah and then Umar and then Ali; while the other contended that Ali was better than Umar. Their debate took long. So Abul Qasim said: “What the companions are unanimous upon is that the Siddiq comes first, then after him the Faruq, and then after him Uthman, owner of the two lights, and then Ali, the Successor. Narrators of traditions uphold this. This is the correct belief before us. Everyone there was perplexed by these words. Members of Ahle Sunnat group were raising him over their heads from gaiety and were praying for him and cursing those who were “accusing him to be a Rafidi.” Laughter was all the while overwhelming me. I tried to withhold it and control myself from laughing by putting my sleeve into my mouth, but then I feared that they will discern who I am, so I left. The Shaykh looked at me and noticed that. When I arrived at my house, there was a knock on the door. I came out and saw Abul Qasim Ibn Ruh on his mule. He had come to me on his way home. He said: “Abdullah, may Allah do you favors, why were you laughing and almost cheering me; as if what I said was not true before you.” I said: “It is true before me.” He said: “Fear God, Shaykh. I will not forgive you if you consider this word of mine great.” I said: “My master, someone who is a companion of the Imam and his representative, if he says a word as such, is it not awkward and laughable?” He said: “By your life, if you say this again, I will desert you.” He bid me farewell and left."

Secondly Allah, the Mighty and the High placed the progeny of the Messenger of Allah (s) only in her being and the survival of the generations of the Prophet was through her and not through anyone else.

Then he turned away from him and returned to our group. I asked him about the reason. He said: One day, I was with Abu Tahir. His brother Abul Tayyib and Ibn Khizr and a group of his followers were present when a servant entered and said: “Abu Ja’far Amari is on the door.” The party was terrified. I asked him what was happening? He said to the slave, “He comes in.” Abu Ja’far came in and the party and Abu Tahir stood for him. He sat at the presidency of the session and Abu Tahir sat humbly before him. Abu Ja’far remained silent until his awe silenced them. Then he said: “Abu Tahir, I call on you by the oath of Allah, did not the Master of the Age order you to deliver to me the goods, which are in your hands?” He said: “By Allah, yes.” Abu Ja’far rose and left. A mortal silence had seized the party. When they regained their bearings, his brother Abul Tayyib said: “From where did you see the Master of the Age?” He replied, “Abu Ja’far took me to one of his houses. He appeared to me from the heights of his house and ordered me to deliver the goods, which I am holding, to Abu Ja’far.” Abul Tayyib asked: “How did you know he was the Master of the Age?” “His awe and imposing charisma overwhelmed me and I was overtaken by apprehension from him,” he said: “I did not know he was the Master of the Age .” This was the reason of my disassociation from them."

So he sent after him. Due to his sheer ignorance, he assumed that Abu Sahl is like the other weaklings in the matter of faith and reckoned that he could be drawn and tricked through his lunacies, and that by commanding Abu Sahl’s loyalty, he will be able to draw yet more followers on the virtue of Abu Sahl’s position in the view of people and his respectability in knowledge and literature. Hallaj sent a message to him, “I am the representative of the Master of the Age .” Through such a message he would first draw the ignorant people and then proceed to other claims. He stated, “I have been ordered to correspond with you and avail you with the help you desire, so your soul may find strength and you may not have doubts in the creed.” Abu Sahl wrote back, “I will ask you a rather minor thing in comparison to the signs and proofs that have been manifested on your hands. I am a man who is fond of women and love to have playful talks with them. I have a number of concubines, but I cannot copulate with all of them. Age and grey hair has created a distance between me and them. I need to dye my hair and beard every Friday, which is a severely laborious work, in order to conceal it from them, lest my condition will be revealed to them and my proximity from them will change to distance and my union into separation. I want you to remove this need of mine of dyeing and suffice me its labor and make my beard black. I will obey you and come to you and believe in you. I will be a preacher of your faith, considering my ingenuity in this matter and your help in that regard.” When Hallaj got this message, he realized that his call to him had been a blunder. He did not reply and did not send him any messenger. On the other hand, Abu Sahl made Hallaj the subject of his talks and jests. He would make jokes of him before everyone. He spread this incident to every young and old, and this led to the revelation of Hallaj’s blasphemous enterprise and the disassociation of the community from him."

Why did you tear his letters?” People laughed and made jests at him. My father went to his store with his disciples and servants. When he entered his store, everyone arose for my father, except one man sitting there. My father did not know him. As my father sat and took out his register of accounts and his pen and ink, as is the custom of the merchants, he asked one of the people who were present about the man sitting there. He told my father about him. The man heard that my father had asked about him, so he came to my father and said: “You inquire about me while I am present?” My father said: “Sir, observing respect and reverence, I did not ask yourself directly.” He said: “You tear my letter while I am watching you?” My father asked, “So you are the man then.” Then he called his servant, “By his feet and his hind! Kick the enemy of Allah and His Messenger out of the house.” Then he said to him, “You claim miracles? May Allah curse you.” The slave grabbed him from his hind and kicked him out.

(قالت) فقلت لها: وما السر؟ قالت: قد أخذ علينا كتمانه وأفزع إن أنا أذعته عوقبت. قالت: وأعطيتها موثقا أني لا أكشفه لأحد واعتقدت في نفسي الاستثناء بالشيخ رضي الله عنه يعني أبا القاسم الحسين بن روح. قالت: إن الشيخ أبا جعفر قال لنا: إن روح رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم انتقلت إلى أبيك- يعني أبا جعفر محمد بن عثمان رضي الله عنه- وروح أمير المؤمنين عليه السلام انتقلت إلى بدن الشيخ أبي القاسم الحسين بن روح، وروح مولاتنا فاطمة عليها السلام انتقلت إليك، فكيف لا أعظمك يا ستنا؟! فقلت لها: مهلا، لا تفعلي. فإن هذا كذب يا ستنا. فقالت لي: هو سر عظيم، وقد أخذ علينا أننا لا نكشف هذا لأحد. فالله الله في!لا يحل لي العذاب، ويا ستي فلو لا أنك حملتيني على كشفه ما كشفته لك ولا لأحد غيرك. قالت الكبيرة أم كلثوم رضي الله عنها: فلما انصرفت من عندها دخلت إلى الشيخ أبي القاسم بن روح رضي الله عنه فأخبرته بالقصة وكان يثق بي ويركن إلى قولي، فقال لي: يا بنية، إياك أن تمضي إلى هذه المرأة بعد ما جرى منها، ولا تقبلي لها رقعة إن كاتبتك ولا رسولا إن أنفذته إليك ولا تلقيها بعد قولها، فهذا كفر بالله تعالى وإلحاد قد أحكمه هذا الرجل الملعون في قلوب هؤلاء القوم ليجعله طريقا إلى أن يقول لهم بأن الله تعالى اتحد به وحل فيه كما يقول النصارى في المسيح عليه السلام،ويعدو إلى قول الحلاج لعنه الله. قالت: فهجرت بني بسطام وتركت المضي إليهم ولم أقبل لهم عذرا ولا لقيت أمهم بعدها وشاع في بني نوبخت الحديث فلم يبق أحد إلا وتقدم إليه الشيخ أبو القاسم وكاتبه بلعن أبي جعفر الشلمغاني والبراءة منه وممن يتولاه ورضي بقوله أو كلمه فضلا عن موالاته. ثم ظهر التوقيع من صاحب الزمان عليه السلام بلعن أبي جعفر محمد بن علي والبراءة منه وممن تابعه وشايعه ورضي بقوله وأقام على توليه بعد المعرفة بهذا التوقيع. وله حكايات قبيحة وأمور فظيعة ننزه كتابنا عن ذكرها،ذكرها ابن نوح وغيره.وكان سبب قتله أنه لما أظهر لعنه أبو القاسم بن روح رضي الله عنه واشتهر أمره وتبرأ منه وأمر جميع الشيعة بذلك لم يمكنه التلبيس فقال في مجلس حافل فيه رؤساء الشيعة،وكل يحكي عن الشيخ أبي القاسم لعنه والبراءة منه أجمعوا بيني وبينه حتى آخذ يده ويأخذ بيدي فإن لم تنزل عليه نار من السماء تحرقه وإلا فجميع ما قاله في حق ورقي ذلك إلى الراضي لأنه كان ذلك في دار ابن مقلة فأمر بالقبض عليه وقتله فقتل واستراحت الشيعة منه.,"H 378 - Husain Ibn Ibrahim narrated to me from Ahmad Ibn Ali Ibn Nuh from Abu Nasr Hibatullah Ibn Muhammad Ibn Ahmad ­Katib, son of binte Umme Kulthum binte Abi Ja’far Amari saying, Lady Umme Kulthum (the daughter of the second deputy of the Imam of the Age) narrated to me, Abu Ja’far Ibn Abul Azaqir was a respectable man before the progeny of Bistam. That is because Abul Qasim Husain Ibn Rauh had conferred much esteem and respect on him in front of the people. After his apostasy, Ibn Abul Azaqir would tell every lie, mischief and heresy to the progeny of Bistam, falsely quoting Shaykh Abul Qasim all the time. The house of Bistam would accept that from him and believe in him, until this came to the knowledge of Abul Qasim and he denied that and called attention to the enormity of the blasphemy and prohibited the progeny of Bistam from listening to him and ordered them to damn and denounce him. However, they did not listen and persisted on following Ibn Abi Azaqir. That was because he would tell them, “I have manifested the secret I had been sworn to secrecy. Therefore, I am being punished to be castigated from position of proximity, because this is a great position that only an Archangel or a great apostle or a tested believer can bear.” He would thus magnify his position and importance in their eyes. When Abul Qasim was informed of this, he wrote to the Bistams to curse him and express their disdain for him, his followers and devotees. When they received the letter, they showed it to him, but he wept profusely and said: “This message has a very profound secret dimension. The curse is banishment. The meaning of his word, May Allah curse him, is May Allah banish him from punishment and Fire. Now you know my position.” He touched the ground with his cheeks and said: “You must keep this matter a secret.” The lady said: I informed Shaykh Abul Qasim what the mother of Abu Ja’far Ibn Bistam had said one day when we were visiting her and she had received me with reverence and veneration, so much so that she fell on my feet to kiss them. I did not let her do that. I said: “Easy, my mistress, this is too much.” I fell on her hands and she cried. Then she said: “How would I not do that to you, while you are my mistress Fatima?” I asked, “How is that?” She said: “The Shaykh,” meaning Abu Ja’far Muhammad Ibn Ali “has confided a secret in us.” “And what is the secret’?” I asked her. “He asked us to hide it and I fear if I reveal it, I will be chastised.” I gave her my most solemn promises that I will not reveal it to anyone, while maintaining in my heart an exception for Shaykh Abul Qasim Husain Ibn Rauh. She said: “The Shaykh Abu Ja’far told us that the spirit of the Messenger of Allah (s) has transferred into you father,” meaning Abu Ja’far Muhammad Ibn Uthman . “And the spirit of Amirul Momineen Ali has transferred into the body of Abul Qasim Husain Ibn Rauh; and the spirit of our mistress Fatima has transferred into you. So how may I not revere you, O our lady?” I said: “Easy! Do not do this, for this is false, my lady.” “This is a great secret and we have been sworn not to reveal this to anyone. For Allah’s sake! For Allah’s sake! May I not deserve punishment!” She beseeched me, “My lady, if you hadn’t insisted, I would not have disclosed this to you or anyone.” Lady Umme Kulthum said: When I returned from her, I went to Shaykh Abul Qasim Ibn Ruh and recounted the event to him. He trusted my word and had confidence in my truthfulness. He said: “My daughter, beware not to go to this woman after this, and don’t accept any letter from her if she writes to you; or a messenger if she sends you one. Do not meet her after she said this. It is blasphemy against Allah and disbelief, which this accursed man has planted and strengthened in their hearts to pave way to the belief that Allah, the Sublime, has unified with him and has diffused into his body, as Christians say about Isa and this amounts to the claim of Hallaj, may Allah curse him. I disassociated myself from the Bistams and stopped visiting them. I did not accept any pretense they offered, nor met their mother afterwards. Then this drift began in the children of Naubakht. Shaykh Abul Qasim approached and wrote to each and every one of them to curse Abu Ja’far Shalmaghani (Ibn Abil Azaqir) and express disdain for him and anyone who follows him, is pleased with his word, or converses with him, let alone loves him. Then the holy letter from the Master of the Age came, having damnation for Abu Ja’far Muhammad Ibn Ali, denunciation for him and anyone who followed him, abided by him and was pleased with his word and maintained his service after learning about this holy letter. There are many ugly stories and repulsive incidents about him that are not worthy of our book. Ibn Nuh and others have recorded these events. What led to Shalmaghani’s murder was that when Abul Qasim Ibn Ruh expressed his curse and made his farce public and denounced him and ordered all Shia to do the same, Ibn Abil Azaqir no longer was able to continue his trickery. In a gathering in which the chiefs of the Shia were present, and everyone was reporting his damnation and denunciation from Shaykh Abul Qasim, he said: “Bring me and him together, so I may hold his hand and he may hold my hand and we will see whether a fire does not descend from the heavens and sets him ablaze. Otherwise, everything he has said about me is true.” The news reached Razibillah, because this was in the house of Ibn Muqillah. He ordered his arrest and execution. Thus, he was killed and the Shia got relief from his mischief."

In such a way that whoever heard the ridicule of that Wali, would immediately run after the Imam and the Wali; in this way the opponent and rival of the Wali is better and superior to Wali and Imam, because the expression of excellence of Wali is possible only in this way. Other beliefs of his and his followers were that they believed that this manner of religion and religiosity continues from the time of the first Adam to the time of the seventh Adam, because they had faith in seven worlds and seven Adams; so much so they reached upto Musa and his opponent, Firon; and Muhammad and Ali and their opponent Abu Bakr and Muawiyah. But with regard to the opposite of Wali and Imam, their belief is that some of them said: The opposite and opponent should be considered as ones Wali and he should be compelled to take up opposition. Thus the people of the Zahir said: Ali Ibn Abi Talib himself appointed Abu Bakr to Caliphate and some said: It is not so; on the contrary the opposite and rival is eternal and is always with the Wali. Another belief of that group is that they say that with regard to Imam Qaim that which the people of Zahir say that he is the son of the eleventh Imam and that he would stage an uprising one day, it implies that it is Iblis (we seek the refuge of Allah), because the Almighty Allah said: So the angels made obeisance, all of them together, but Iblis (did it not); he refused to be with those who made obeisance. After that the Holy Quran said about Iblis: “I will certainly lie in wait for them in Thy straight path.” Therefore, this verse proves that when the Satan was commanded to prostrate, he staged an uprising and arose against Almighty Allah and after that he sat in ambush. Therefore, according to Zahiraya sect, the Qaim who would stage an uprising (Allah’s refuge!) implies the same Qaim who was commanded to prostrate before Adam and he refused; and he is Iblis. A poet of that group (may Allah curse them all) has composed some couplets in this regard: O one who curses the opposite and rival, which is from Adi tribe [that is Umar bin Khattab], do not curse him. Opposite of anything is not except Wali and Zahir; that is (we seek refuge of Allah) opposite is the apparent Wali and Wali is the inner aspect of the opposite. Praise is only for creator of the universe who fulfills His promise and my condition is not like that of a pigeon. And in the same way one who is not like a barber; and I have defeated Mahdi in debate and discussion about religious faith. Yes, I have also overlooked him for the excellence and merit of servitude; higher than the status of one who was not a Majus. It is because according to my faith, Allah is One without any change of circumstances and in this way is one with every unity (unconditionally). O supporters of the Hashemite family you have become imbued with every luminosity and darkness. And O deniers of the family of Kisra and family of Sasan; who is a favorite from the aspect of Ajami and Farsi, like the group of Bani Loih remained concealed among the Arabs."

The ink was still wet and had not dried. A group of scholars narrated to us on the authority of Ibn Dawood saying, the holy letter came through Husain Ibn Rauh about Shalmaghani. He sent a copy thereof to Abu Ali Ibn Himam in the Dhul Hijja of three hundred and twelve. Ibn Nuh said: Abul Fath Ahmad Ibn Zakka, the ally of Ali Ibn Muhammad Ibn Furat said: Abu Ali Ibn Himam Ibn Suhail informed us about the holy letter that came in Dhul Hijja of three hundred and twelve. Muhammad Ibn Hasan Ibn Ja’far Ismail Ibn Salih Saymoori said: Shaykh Husain Ibn Rauh sent it from the house of Muqtadir to our Shaykh Abu Ali Ibn Himam in the Dhul Hijja of three hundred and twelve. Abu Ali dictated the letter to me and told me that Abul Qasim is no longer bound not to express denunciation of Shalmaghani. He is in the hands of the people and their captive. He was ordered to denounce and not to fear and will be safe. He was released soon after that. All praise belongs to Allah. Reminder: There are minor differences in different versions of this epistle and while translating it, we have reconciled them. The opening lines of the epistle quoted through someone other than Saymoori are as follows: Inform our brothers, may the Almighty Allah make them succeed, about whose faith you are assured… Following is mentioned in the report of Saymoori: “May Allah prolong your life, and may He let you know all good, and may He eventuate your actions with a good end. In the report of Ibn Dawood it is mentioned: Let everyone from our brothers know, whose religiosity you trust and whose sincerity you are confident to know, may Allah make you all fortuitous: The epistle continues, which is same in all versions as follows: Muhammad Ibn Ali known as Shalmaghani, may God hasten His punishment to him and may He respite him not, has abandoned and deserted Islam. He has blasphemed the religion of Allah and made claims that amount to disbelief and denial of the Creator. He has weaved lies and falsehood. He has spoken dishonestly and committed a grave sinister act. Those who associate with God are liars; they have trodden far in misguidance and have sustained a palpable loss. We have turned away with repulsion from this person to Allah, the High, and to His Messenger and household, unto them be the blessings of Allah and His peace, mercy and grace. We have, in public and private, in secrecy and in open, and in every time and condition, invoked continuous damnations of God for him and for anyone who follows him and pledges allegiance to him, or hears this word of ours and remains steadfast in his devotion to him. Let them know that we shun him. After ‘Let them know’ Saymoori has mentioned ‘may Allah enhance your honor’ and Ibn Dawood has instead mentioned ‘we shun his friendship’. Harun says: The last sentence was as follows: Inform that we shun him and stay away with disdain from this person. Ibn Dawood and Harun say: After that is the sentence: We shun him like we had previously shunned others like them. Saymoori in place of this sentence has narrated as follows: ‘On the basis of that which we previously did with regard to those like him and condemned them’, and Ibn Zaka has quoted like Saymoori. The blessed epistle continues as follows and is same in all versions: [We curse him] He is like Shari, ­Numairi, Hilali, Bilali and others. The practice of Allah, the Mighty and the High is that He accepts our supplication or curse. And Ibn Dawood and Harun have said: After ‘practice of Allah’ it is mentioned ‘majestic His praise is’ but the words of ‘practice of Allah’ is mentioned in all versions. After that it is mentioned ‘the practice of the Almighty Allah with this, prior to this and after this, is beautiful to us. In Him we have trust, from Him we seek help, and He is sufficient for us in all our affairs and He is the best caretaker.” Harun says: Abu Ali took this epistle and read it out to all the elders of society. After that he made copies of the same and sent to all the towns. Due to this, it became well known among Shia and all of them reached consensus in cursing him. He was killed in 323 A.H."

When they get peace and security they will think that their kingdom will never decline. Meanwhile, suddenly a divine command will arrive and no king will be able to remain in power. Thus the Almighty Allah says: “…until when the earth puts on its golden raiment and it becomes garnished, and its people think that they have power over it, Our command comes to it, by night or by day, so We render it as reaped seed-produce, as though it had not been in existence yesterday; thus do We make clear the communications for a people who reflect.” (10:24) The narrator says: I said: May I be your ransom, is some time fixed for the arrival of divine command? He replied: No, because the knowledge of Allah dominates the knowledge of those who fix the time. The Almighty Allah promised thirty nights to Prophet Musa and then increased ten nights; but neither Prophet Musa was aware of it, nor Bani Israel. Thus when the time expired, they said that Prophet Musa has deceived us; and began to worship the calf. Hence, when famine and deprivation increases and people begin to deny each other, you should expect the arrival of divine command day and night.”"

Thus if He changes the conditions and circumstances, He would also change the exigency and that fixed time would be replaced by another. Definitely in the later periods also the same matter continues and the explanation is on the same base. Due to this, neither the time, which was fixed previously, all other times can also be postponed under some conditions till that which is causing delay of reappearance is not repeated, and till the time arrives, which nothing can change and which is imminent. Reports about the topic of delay in age, deaths and increase in lifespan due to supplication, alms and doing a good turn to relatives and also that which is mentioned under the subject of decrease in lifespan and advancement of deaths as a result of oppression, breaking off relations and other acts, is based on the same interpretation and although Allah, the Mighty and the High is aware of both of them, but it is possible that one of them is not definite and the other is definite, and in this matter there is no difference between Imamiyah and Mutazila. Also reports in which the word of ‘Bada’ is mentioned, are also due to the same interpretation and it is clear that the meaning of ‘Bada’ is abrogation of something in which change is justified and possible, or that its conditions have changed, in case that informing about it is Takweeni (providential) as the literal meaning of ‘Bada’ is appearance. Thus, it is possible that one of the acts of Almighty Allah has become apparent for us whereas we had imagined it’s opposite or that we were aware of it, but did not know its conditions and of such kind are the following reports:"

The western portion of the Masjid of Damascus caves in and its boundary walls collapse. Three groups will set out from Damascus to seize power. One would be led by a person on a piebald horse, another on a red horse and a man from the descendants of Abu Sufyan would rise up from the province of Kalab; who would bring all the people to Damascus and expel the people of the west to Egypt. When they enter Damascus, it would be the sign for the uprising of Sufyani and before that a person would stage an uprising and call the people to Aale Muhammad . The Turks would camp in Hira and the Romans would camp at Palestine and Abdullah would march forward till both the armies come face to face at Qurqisiya and a severe battle would ensue at the river banks. When the king of the west marches, he would kill the men and captivate the women. Then he would return to Qays till Sufyani enters the peninsula. Then Yamani would move and take over whatever the people had gathered. Then he would come to Kufa and slay the followers and supporters of Aale Muhammad ; on the contrary, he would also slay the one who is named after them. After that Imam Mahdi would arise and his standard would be held by Shuaib bin Salih. When Syrians realize that their country has come under the rule of the descendant of Abu Sufyan, they would go to Mecca. Nafse Zakiyyah and his brother would be killed at that time.

His Eminence would summon one of his men and attach a sword to his waist. He would slay the whole crowd single-handed and not one of them would be spared. After that His Eminence would turn to Kabul Shah. It is a city that no one has ever conquered, but he would conquer it. After that he would return to Kufa and reside there after eliminating seventy Arab tribes…”"
