The Opening,1,1,"All praise be to Allah alone, the Sustainer of all the worlds,"
The Opening,1,2,"Most Compassionate, Ever-Merciful,"
The Opening,1,3,Master of the Day of Judgment.
The Opening,1,4,(O Allah!) You alone do we worship and to You alone do we look for help.
The Opening,1,5,"Show us the straight path,"
The Opening,1,6,"The path of those upon whom You have bestowed Your favours,"
The Opening,1,7,"Not of those who have been afflicted with wrath, nor of those who have gone astray."
The Cow,2,1,"Alif, Lam, Mim. (Only Allah and the Messenger [blessings and peace be upon him] know the real meaning.)"
The Cow,2,2,(This is) the Glorious Book in which there is no chance of doubt. (It is) a guide for those who guard against evil and fear Allah:
The Cow,2,3,"Those who believe in the unseen, and establish Prayer (fulfilling all its requisites) and spend (in Our way) out of what We have given them;"
The Cow,2,4,"And those who believe in (all) that which has been revealed to you, and that which was revealed before you, and also have (perfect) faith in the Hereafter."
The Cow,2,5,"It is they who follow guidance from their Lord, and it is they who shall achieve real success."
The Cow,2,6,"Verily, those who have adopted disbelief, it is the same for them whether you warn them or you warn them not, they will not believe."
The Cow,2,7,"Allah (as a result of their own choice) has set a seal on their hearts and their ears, and there is a blindfold (set) over their eyes. And for them there is a severe torment."
The Cow,2,8,"And amongst people there are (also) some who say: ‘We believe in Allah and the Last Day,’ whereas they are not (at all) believers."
The Cow,2,9,"They seek to deceive Allah (i.e., the Messenger) and the believers, but (in fact) they deceive only themselves and they are not aware of it.*"
The Cow,2,10,"In their hearts is a disease. So Allah has worsened their disease. And for them, there is painful punishment because they used to tell lies."
The Cow,2,11,"When it is said to them: ‘Do not spread disorder in the land,’ they say: ‘It is we who reform.’"
The Cow,2,12,"Beware! (Truly) it is they who spread disorder, but they do not have any sense (of it) at all."
The Cow,2,13,"And when it is said to them: ‘Believe as (other) people have believed,’ they say: ‘Shall we also believe (as those) fools have believed?’ Beware! (Certainly) they are themselves fools, but they do not know (their foolishness and low level)."
The Cow,2,14,"And when they (the hypocrites) meet the believers, they say: ‘We (too) have believed,’ and when they meet their devils in private, they assure them: ‘We are certainly with you. We only mock (the believers).’"
The Cow,2,15,"Allah punishes them for their mockery, and lets them loose (so that they meet their fate). So they are wandering blindly in their transgression."
The Cow,2,16,"These are the people who have purchased misguidance for guidance; but their trade did not yield any gain, and they did not know the way to a (gainful and profitable) bargain."
The Cow,2,17,"Their example is like a person who lit a fire (in surrounding darkness), and when it brightened the environment, Allah took away their light and left them in total darkness. Now they cannot see anything."
The Cow,2,18,"They are deaf, dumb and blind. So they will not return (to the right path)."
The Cow,2,19,"Or their example is like a rain pouring from the sky wherein there are layers of darkness and thunder and lightning (as well). They thrust their fingers into their ears, fearing death due to the thunder. And Allah has encompassed the disbelievers."
The Cow,2,20,"It seems as if the lightning would snatch away their sight. When their (surroundings) are lit with a flash, they start walking, and when darkness covers them, they stand still. And if Allah had willed, He would have completely deprived them of hearing and sight. Surely, Allah is All-Powerful to do everything."
The Cow,2,21,"O people! Worship your Lord, Who created you and (also) those who were before you, so that you become Godwary."
The Cow,2,22,"(He is the One) Who spread out the earth for you as a floor, and erected the sky as a mansion, and showered water from the sky and brought forth with that (a variety of) fruits for your nourishment. So, do not set up equals with Allah whilst you know (the truth of the matter)."
The Cow,2,23,"And if you are in doubt about this (Book) which We have revealed to Our (exalted) servant, then produce only one chapter like this. And (for this task) you may call upon (all) your helpers apart from Allah if you are true (in your doubt and denial)."
The Cow,2,24,"But if you fail to do it—and you shall never be able to do it—then guard yourselves against the Fire whose fuel is human beings (the disbelievers) and stones (their idols), prepared for disbelievers."
The Cow,2,25,"And, (O Beloved Prophet,) give glad tidings to those who believe and keep doing pious deeds that for them there are Gardens (of Paradise) beneath which streams flow. When some fruit will be given to them from these Gardens to eat, they will say (looking at its appearance): ‘This is the same fruit that was provided to us (in the world) before,’ whereas they will be given fruits resembling (only in appearance). In Paradise, there will (also) be chaste spouses for them, and they shall abide there for ever."
The Cow,2,26,"Indeed, Allah is not reluctant to narrate some example (for better comprehension), whether of a mosquito or something even more (disgusting) than that. The believers know well that this example is (a pointer to the truth) from their Lord. But those who have adopted disbelief ask (on hearing): ‘What could Allah mean by this example?’ (In this way) Allah holds many astray, and guides many aright with the same example. And by this He leaves in error only those who are (already) disobedient."
The Cow,2,27,"(These disobedient people are those) who break the promise of Allah after having confirmed it, and break that (relationship) which Allah has ordered to be joined, and create disorder in the land. It is they who are the losers."
The Cow,2,28,"How can you deny Allah, whereas you were lifeless and He gave you life, then He will cause you to die and will again bring you back to life, and then to Him you will be returned?"
The Cow,2,29,He is the One Who created for you all that is in the earth. Then He turned towards the higher regions (of the universe) and perfected them into seven heavenly firmaments. And He has full knowledge of everything.
The Cow,2,30,"And (recall) when your Lord said to the angels: ‘I am about to place My vicegerent on the earth.’ They submitted: ‘Will You put Your (vicegerent) on the earth such as will do mischief in it and shed blood, whilst we are engaged in glorifying You with celebrating Your Praise and extolling Your Holiness (all the time)?’ (Allah) said: ‘I know that which you do not know.’"
The Cow,2,31,"And Allah taught Adam the names of all (things), and then presented them before the angels and said: ‘Tell Me the names of these things if you are true (in your assumption).’"
The Cow,2,32,"The angels (humbly) submitted: ‘Glory to You, You are Holy (free from every deficiency). We have no knowledge except that which You have taught us. Surely, You alone are All-Knowing, All-Wise.’"
The Cow,2,33,"Allah said: ‘O Adam, (now) apprise them of the names of these things.’ So when Adam had told them the names of those things, (Allah) said: ‘Did I not tell you I know (all) the hidden realities of the heavens and the earth and also know all that you disclose and all that you conceal?’"
The Cow,2,34,"And (also recall) when We commanded the angels: ‘Prostrate yourselves before Adam.’ Then they all prostrated themselves to Adam except Iblis (Satan). He refused and showed arrogance, and (consequently) became one of the disbelievers."
The Cow,2,35,"And We ordained: ‘O Adam, reside you and your wife in this Paradise and eat of it, both of you, whatever you like and from wherever you will. But do not go near this tree lest you should (join) the transgressors.’"
The Cow,2,36,"Then Satan shook them from that place, and removed them from the (blissful) location where they were. And (eventually) We ordained: ‘Go down (and live in the earth); you will remain enemies to each other, and now in the earth you have been destined a dwelling place and sustenance for a fixed time.’"
The Cow,2,37,"Then Adam learnt some words (of humility and repentance) from his Lord. So Allah accepted his repentance. Surely, He is the One Who is Most Relenting, Ever-Merciful."
The Cow,2,38,"We said: ‘Leave it (Paradise and settle in the earth), all of you. Then if there comes to you guidance from Me, whoever will follow My guidance, neither shall any fear (obsess) them, nor shall they grieve."
The Cow,2,39,"And those who disbelieve and deny Our Revelations, it is they who shall be the inmates of the Fire. They shall abide in it forever.’"
The Cow,2,40,"O Children of Ya‘qub (Jacob)! Recall My favours which I bestowed upon you and fulfil the promise (made) to Me, I shall fulfil the promise (made) to you. And always fear Me alone."
The Cow,2,41,"And believe in (the Book) that I have revealed (to My Messenger Muhammad [blessings and peace be upon him]), whilst it confirms (originally) that which you possess. And do not be the first to deny it, nor trade My Revelations for a small (worldly) price. And fear Me alone."
The Cow,2,42,"And do not mix up the truth with falsehood, nor conceal the truth deliberately."
The Cow,2,43,And establish Prayer and pay Zakat (the Alms-due) regularly and kneel down (together) with those who kneel down.
The Cow,2,44,"Do you command others for piety and forget yourselves, whilst you (also) recite the Book (of Allah)? So, do you not think?"
The Cow,2,45,And seek (Allah’s) help through patience and Prayer. But this is no doubt hard except for the humble (whose hearts have been softened with the Love of Allah and gripped with His Fear).
The Cow,2,46,(It is they) who are certain that they are about to meet their Lord and to Him are they going to return.
The Cow,2,47,"O Children of Ya‘qub (Jacob)! Recall those favours that I bestowed upon you, and that I exalted you above all the people (of your age)."
The Cow,2,48,And fear that Day when no soul shall be able to pay any compensation on behalf of another. Nor shall any intercession be accepted from him (of a person who shall not have Allah’s permission to intercede). Nor shall any compensation be accepted from him (for his own salvation). And they will not be helped (against Allah’s decree).
The Cow,2,49,"And (also recall) when We delivered you from Pharaoh’s people, who used to inflict severe torment upon you: they slaughtered your sons and kept your daughters alive. There was an arduously terrible trial in it from your Lord."
The Cow,2,50,"And when We parted the river (to rescue you) and (in this way) delivered you, and (on the contrary) We drowned Pharaoh’s people before your eyes."
The Cow,2,51,"And (also recall) when We made an appointment with Musa (Moses) for forty nights. Then after Musa ([Moses] went into retreat), you took the calf as (your) god for worship, and you were no doubt awful transgressors."
The Cow,2,52,Then We pardoned you (even) after that so that you might give thanks.
The Cow,2,53,"And (remember) when We bestowed upon Musa (Moses) the Book and the miracle distinguishing the truth from falsehood, so that you might take the path of guidance."
The Cow,2,54,"And when Musa (Moses) said to his people: ‘O my people, no doubt you have (seriously) wronged your own souls in taking the calf (as your god). Now turn in repentance to your Creator (the True Sustainer). So, kill one another (amongst yourselves so that those who have not taken the calf for worship and who have stuck to their religion should kill those who worshipped the calf as punishment for turning away from their religion). This (act) would be the best (repentance) for you in the sight of your Creator.’ Then He accepted your repentance. Surely, He is Most Relenting, Ever-Merciful."
The Cow,2,55,"And (remember) when you said: ‘O Musa (Moses)! We will never believe in you until we see Allah completely unveiled (before our eyes).’ So, (on this) a thunder seized (and eliminated) you, and you kept watching (this spectacle yourselves)."
The Cow,2,56,Then We brought you back to life after your death so that you pay (Us) thanks.
The Cow,2,57,"And (recall) when We cast the shade of clouds over you (in the Tiha valley) and sent down for you manna and quails so that you might eat of the pure things We provided for you. So they did not harm Us at all (by disobeying and showing Us disregard), but persistently harmed their own souls."
The Cow,2,58,"And (remember) when We said: ‘Enter this city, and eat as much as you wish from wherever you desire, but enter (the city) gate prostrating and praying: (O our Lord!) We seek forgiveness (for all of our sins). We shall (then) forgive your (previous) sins and, (besides,) We shall bestow more (favours and blessings) upon the righteous.’"
The Cow,2,59,But (those) transgressors substituted some other phrase in place of that which was said to them. So We sent down a calamity from heaven on (those) evildoers (in the form of a plague) because they were (persistently) disobeying.
The Cow,2,60,"And (recall) when Musa (Moses) prayed for water for his people. We directed: ‘Strike that rock with your stick.’ Then twelve springs gushed out of that (rock). Verily, each clan identified their respective drinking place. (We said:) ‘Eat and drink of the sustenance (given) by Allah, but do not seek to do mischief in the land.’"
The Cow,2,61,"And when you said: ‘O Musa (Moses), we cannot be content with only one kind of food (i.e., manna and quails), so pray to your Lord (in our favour) that He may bring forth for us of cultivated produce: green herbs, cucumbers, wheat, garlic, lentils and onions.’ (Musa [Moses]) said (to his people): ‘Do you demand something inferior in exchange for something superior? (And if that is what you wish, then) go down to any city. Surely (there) will be (available) all what you demand.’ Then dishonour and deprivation were brought upon them, and they incurred the wrath of Allah because they used to deny the signs of Allah and kill the Prophets unjustly. This was also because they used to disobey and would (always) exceed limits."
The Cow,2,62,"Verily, those who have believed, and (those who were) Jews and Christians and Sabians, those (of them) who believe in Allah and the Last Day and act piously, there is for them their reward with their Lord. Neither shall any fear afflict them, nor shall they grieve."
The Cow,2,63,"And (recall) when We took a firm promise from you and raised the Mount of Sinai high above you, so that you hold fast firmly what We have given you. And bear in mind whatever is (written) in this (Book, the Torah,) so that you become pious."
The Cow,2,64,"Yet you turned back after this (promise and warning). So, had there not been Allah’s bounty and His mercy upon you, you would have been wrecked indeed."
The Cow,2,65,And (O Jews) certainly you know well those of you who violated (the injunctions concerning) the Sabbath (Saturday). So We said to them: ‘Be you apes: rejected and despised.’
The Cow,2,66,"So We made this (event) a lesson of warning for their contemporaries as well as later generations, and (a source of) admonition for the pious."
The Cow,2,67,"And (also recall) when Musa (Moses) said to his people: ‘Verily, Allah enjoins you to sacrifice a cow.’ They said: ‘Do you make fools of us?’ Musa (Moses) said: ‘I seek the protection of Allah (against) becoming one of the ignorant.’"
The Cow,2,68,"(Then) they said: ‘Pray for us to your Lord that He may make clear to us what kind of cow (that) shall be.’ (Musa [Moses]) said: ‘Certainly, He ordains that the cow is to be neither old nor young (heifer), but in between (fully grown). So now implement what you have been ordered.’"
The Cow,2,69,"They (again) said: ‘Pray to your Lord for us that He may specify what her colour should be.’ Musa (Moses) said: ‘He says the cow should be yellow, rich in tone, (so attractive that) it pleases the viewers.’"
The Cow,2,70,"(This time) they said: ‘Pray for us to your Lord that He may make clear to us what exact type of cow it is (because) the cow has become doubtful to us, and if Allah so wills, we shall indeed be guided aright.’"
The Cow,2,71,"(Musa [Moses] said:) Allah has ordained: ‘(That is not any inferior cow. Instead) it is certainly (a superior) cow, which has been employed neither for ploughing nor for watering the field, a cow in sound health, without any blemish.’ They said: ‘Now you (have) brought the truth.’ So they sacrificed it, though they did not look like doing it."
The Cow,2,72,"And (recall), when you killed a man, then started disputing amongst yourselves (for its blame), and Allah was to unveil that event which you were concealing."
The Cow,2,73,"Then We commanded: ‘Strike this (dead body) with a piece of this (cow).’ That is how Allah restores the dead to life, (or will give life to the dead on the Day of Resurrection,) and He shows you His signs so that you may apply your knowledge and understanding."
The Cow,2,74,"Then (even) after this, your hearts hardened. So (in hardness) they (have become) like stones or even harder. For of stones there are some from which streams burst out; and certainly, some out of them are such (stones) that split up and water gushes out of them; and indeed there are others of them that fall due to fear of Allah. (Alas! Your hearts have not remained even that much soft, tender and feeble) and Allah is not unaware of what you do."
The Cow,2,75,"(O Muslims!) Do you expect that they (the Jews) will believe in you, whereas amongst them were people of a group who heard the Word of Allah (Tawrat [the Torah]), then altered it (themselves) after understanding it, although they knew well (what the truth was and what they were doing)?"
The Cow,2,76,"And (they have reached such a state that) when they meet the believers, they say: ‘We (too) have believed (in Muhammad [blessings and peace be upon him], like you),’ and when they are together in isolation, they say: ‘Do you tell them (the Muslims) that which Allah has unfolded to you (through the Torah in connection with the Prophethood and glory of the last of the Prophets, Muhammad, [blessings and peace be upon him]) so that they may use it in argument against you in the holy presence of your Lord? Do you not have (even this much) sense?’"
The Cow,2,77,Are they not aware that Allah knows full well all that they hide and all that they show?
The Cow,2,78,And (some) amongst them (the Jews) are illiterate (as well) who do not know (even the bare minimum about the meaning and connotations of) the Book (except hearsay and false hopes). They know only to recite (the Book) verbally and follow mere speculation and assumption.
The Cow,2,79,"So, a serious disaster awaits those who write the Book with their own hands, then say: ‘This is from Allah,’ just to earn a paltry price for that. So they will face destruction (owing to the Book) that their hands have written and (for the compensation) that they are earning."
The Cow,2,80,And they (the Jews also) say: ‘The Fire (of Hell) shall not touch us except for a small number of days.’ (Just) ask (them): ‘Have you obtained (such) a promise from Allah? Then He will never violate His promise. Or do you inadvertently make (such an) allegation against Allah that you do not know yourselves?’
The Cow,2,81,"Of course, he who adopts evil and is encompassed by his sins, it is they who are the inmates of Hell. They are its permanent residents."
The Cow,2,82,"And those who have believed and have done pious deeds, it is they who are the inhabitants of Paradise. They shall live there forever."
The Cow,2,83,"And (remember) when We took a firm promise from the Children of Ya‘qub (Jacob): ‘Do not worship (anyone) besides Allah, and be kind to the parents and (do good to) the kindred and orphans and the needy. And (also) talk of piety to the common people (in a polite and pleasant manner). And establish Prayer and pay Zakat (the Alms-due).’ Then, all the rest of you, except a few, turned back (from the promise) and you are but averse (to the truth)."
The Cow,2,84,"And when We took from you (this) solemn covenant (as well): ‘You shall not shed one another’s blood (amongst yourselves), nor shall you expel your people (from their homes and townships).’ Then you agreed (to implement it) and you (also) bear witness (to it)."
The Cow,2,85,"Yet it is you who are killing your own people and banishing a section of your own folk from their homeland, and (furthermore) helping (their enemies) with sin and transgression against them. And if they come to you as captives, you ransom their release (so that they remain obliged to you), whereas it was forbidden to you to exile them from their homeland. Do you believe in some parts of the Book and deny some others? So he who does so from amongst you, what can be his punishment but disgrace (and humiliation) in the worldly life? And (also) on the Day of Resurrection, (such people) will be returned to the most ruthless torment. And Allah is not unaware of your deeds."
The Cow,2,86,"It is they who have purchased the worldly life for the Hereafter. So neither will their torment be lessened, nor will they be helped."
The Cow,2,87,"And surely We gave Musa (Moses) the Book (the Torah) and sent (many) Messengers after him in succession. And We also gave ‘Isa, the son of Maryam, (Jesus, the son of Mary,) luminous signs and strengthened (and supported) him by means of the Holy Spirit. But (what followed is that) whenever a Messenger brought you (the commandments) your (ill-commanding) selves disliked, you adamantly resisted there and then. You belied some of them and started killing others."
The Cow,2,88,"And the Jews said: ‘Our hearts are wrapped up in covers.’ (Nay) but Allah has cursed them for their revolt against faith. So, little do they believe."
The Cow,2,89,"And when the Book (the Qur’an) came to them from Allah which (originally) validates that Book (the Torah) which was with them, whereas, before this, they themselves used to pray for victory over the disbelievers (through the intermediation of the Last Prophet, Muhammad, [blessings and peace be upon him] and the Holy Qur’an revealed to him), but when came to them the same Prophet (Muhammad [blessings and peace be upon him] along with the Book revealed to him, the Qur’an) whom they had (already) recognized, they denied him. So Allah’s curse is upon such (deliberate) disbelievers."
The Cow,2,90,"How evil a bargain they made in exchange for their lives: that they deny the Book revealed by Allah merely begrudging that Allah bestows (His Revelation) out of His bounty upon any of His servants He wills. So they earned manifold wrath of Allah, and there is a humiliating torment for the disbelievers."
The Cow,2,91,"And when it is said to them: ‘Believe in this (Book) which Allah has (now) revealed,’ they say: ‘We believe only in that (Book) which was revealed to us,’ and they deny all other than that, whereas this (Qur’an) is (also) the truth, (and) confirms that (Book as well) which they possess. Ask (them): ‘Then why have you been killing the Prophets of Allah before this if you (really) believe (but in your own Book)?’"
The Cow,2,92,And (the fact remains that) Musa ([Moses] himself) brought you clear signs. Then you took the calf as god after him. And you are but wicked (without any doubt).
The Cow,2,93,"And when We took a firm promise from you, and We raised the Mount of Sinai high above you, (saying): ‘Hold fast to this (Book) which We have given you and listen (to Our commandment).’ Then (your chiefs) said: ‘We have heard but disobeyed.’ And owing to their revolt against faith, their hearts were imbued with the love of the calf. (O Beloved) say (to them): ‘These utterances are (most) vile which your (so-called) faith commands you if you believe (in them truly).’"
The Cow,2,94,"Say: ‘If in the sight of Allah the dwelling in the Hereafter is reserved for you alone, and not for others, then long for death (without any fear) if (you presume) you are truthful.’"
The Cow,2,95,But they will never long for it because of the sins (and atrocities) their hands have sent ahead (or have committed already) and Allah knows the wrongdoers full well.
The Cow,2,96,"And you will certainly find them the most ambitious of mankind for longevity, (even) more than the polytheists aspire to attain. Each one of them desires that he should be granted life of a thousand (years). But even if he is granted that, such a prolonged life cannot save him from the torment. And Allah is monitoring their deeds minutely."
The Cow,2,97,"Say: ‘Whoever is an enemy to Jibril ([Gabriel] is doing injustice), because he is the one who has brought (the Qur’an) down upon your heart only by Allah’s command (which) confirms the preceding (Books) and contains (absolute) guidance and glad tidings for the believers;"
The Cow,2,98,"He who is an enemy to Allah, His angels, His Messengers and Gabriel and Michael, verily Allah (too) is an enemy to (these) disbelievers.’"
The Cow,2,99,And certainly We have sent down to you luminous signs and none but the disobedient can deny them.
The Cow,2,100,"And is it (not so) that every time they made a promise, a party of them disregarded it and threw it aside? The fact is that most of them do not believe."
The Cow,2,101,"And (likewise), when there came to them from Allah the Messenger, (Muhammad, blessings and peace be upon him,) who (originally) confirms that Book which they (already) possessed, a party of the People of the Book threw the (same) Book of Allah (the Torah) behind their backs as if they did not know (it, whereas the same Torah had brought them the good news of the holy arrival of Muhammad the Last Prophet [blessings and peace be upon him])."
The Cow,2,102,"And they (the Jews) pursued that (magic) which the devils used to recite during the reign of Sulayman (Solomon). Sulayman (Solomon) did not disbelieve (in any way). It was, in fact, the devils that disbelieved. They used to teach witchcraft to the people and (also) pursued that (sorcery) which was sent down upon the two angels named Harut and Marut in Babylon. They both did not teach anything to anyone, except that they would say: ‘We are merely (for) trial, therefore, do not become disbelievers (by putting faith in it).’ In spite of that they (the Jews) used to learn such (magic) from both of them by which they caused separation between husband and wife. Yet they cannot harm anyone by this except under the command of Allah. And they learn only the things which are harmful to them and bring them no profit. And surely they (also) knew that he who would buy this (sorcery or disbelief) would not have any share in the Hereafter. And most evil is that for which they sold (the real well-being or the success of) their souls (in the Hereafter). Would that they knew (the truth of) this (bargain)!"
The Cow,2,103,"But if they had believed and become Godfearing, (even a little) reward from Allah would have been far better (than all these things). If they but knew (this secret)!"
The Cow,2,104,"O believers! (Seeking the kind attention of the Holy Prophet) do not say: ‘ra‘ina (Pay attention to us),’ but submit (most humbly): ‘unzurna (Bless us with your benevolent gaze),’ and be all ears (towards his gracious discourse). And there is grievous torment for the disbelievers."
The Cow,2,105,Neither the disbelievers amongst the People of the Book nor the polytheists like that any blessing should descend upon you from your Lord. And Allah especially chooses whom He pleases for His mercy. And Allah possesses infinite bounties.
The Cow,2,106,"When We abrogate some verse or cause it to be forgotten, (in either case) We bring (some other verse) better than or similar to it. Do you not know that Allah has (absolute) control over everything?"
The Cow,2,107,"Do you not know that the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth belongs to Allah alone, and that you have neither any friend nor any helper aside from Allah?"
The Cow,2,108,"(O Muslims!) Do you also want to ask your Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) questions the way Musa (Moses) was asked before? So he who changes belief for disbelief, for sure, loses the right path."
The Cow,2,109,"Many of the People of the Book desire to turn you back to disbelief after you have believed because of the jealousy they have in their hearts, despite the fact that the truth has become evident to them. So keep forbearing and overlooking till Allah sends His command. Verily, Allah has (absolute) control over everything."
The Cow,2,110,"And (always) establish Prayer and pay Zakat (the Alms-due) regularly. And whatever virtue you will send ahead, you shall find it with Allah. Surely, Allah is watching all that you are doing."
The Cow,2,111,And (the People of the Book) say: ‘No one will enter Paradise except he who is a Jew or a Christian.’ These are their false hopes. Say: ‘Produce your proof (in favour of this desire) if you are rightful (in your claim).’
The Cow,2,112,"Yes, of course, he who submits his face to Allah (i.e., consigns himself to Allah) and becomes a man of excellence in piety will find his reward with his Lord. Such people will neither fear anything nor grieve."
The Cow,2,113,"And the Jews say: ‘The Christians do not have their base upon anything (i.e., sound faith),’ and the Christians say: ‘The Jews do not have their base upon anything,’ yet they (all) read the Book (revealed by Allah). Likewise, they (the polytheists) who do not have any (heavenly) knowledge (at all) also make statements like theirs. So Allah will (Himself) judge between them on the Day of Resurrection in the matter in which they differ."
The Cow,2,114,"And who is more unjust than he who forbids remembering Allah’s Name in His mosques and strives to desolate them? It was not proper for them to enter the mosques but fearing (Allah). For them is disgrace in this world, and (also) there is a dreadful torment for them in the Hereafter."
The Cow,2,115,"And the east and the west (all) belong to Allah alone. So whichever direction you turn to, there is the presence of Allah (i.e., the essence of Allah is radiantly manifest in all directions). Surely, Allah is Infinite, All-Knowing."
The Cow,2,116,"And they say: ‘Allah has begotten a son for Himself,’ whilst He is Holy and Transcendent, far above (this). Rather (all) that is in the heavens and in the earth is His (creation and belonging) and all are subservient to Him."
The Cow,2,117,"He is the One Who has originated the heavens and the earth, and when He wills to (originate) a thing, He only says to it: ‘Be,’ and it becomes."
The Cow,2,118,"And those who lack knowledge say: ‘Why does Allah not speak to us, or why does any sign not come to us (directly)?’ Likewise, the people before them also said words similar to theirs. The hearts of (all) these people are alike. We have indeed made the signs explicit for those whose faith is firm."
The Cow,2,119,(O Esteemed Beloved!) We have certainly sent you with the truth as a Bearer of good news and as a Warner. And you will not be asked about the inmates of Hell.
The Cow,2,120,"And the Jews and the Christians shall, by no means, be pleased with you until you follow their religion. Say: ‘Surely, the guidance (given) by Allah is the (only real) guidance.’ (Said for the education of the Umma [the community]:) ‘And, (supposing the impossible,) if you follow their desires after that knowledge which has come to you (from Allah), then there will not be any friend or helper for you to protect you from Allah.’"
The Cow,2,121,"(Also there are people) whom We gave the Book. They recite it as it ought to be recited. It is these people who believe in it (the Book). And those who deny it, it is they who are the losers."
The Cow,2,122,"O Children of Ya‘qub (Jacob)! Remember My favour that I bestowed upon you, and (especially) the supremacy which I awarded you over all the communities (of that age)."
The Cow,2,123,And fear that Day when no soul shall be able to recompense anything on behalf of another; nor shall any ransom be accepted from him (to deliver himself); nor shall any intercession benefit him (without Allah’s permission); nor shall they be helped (against the command of Allah).
The Cow,2,124,"And (call to mind) when the Lord of Ibrahim (Abraham) tested him with several commands which he fulfilled. (On this) Allah said: ‘I am going to make you the leader of mankind.’ He submitted: ‘And from my children as well?’ Allah said: ‘(Yes, but) My promise does not apply to the transgressors.’"
The Cow,2,125,"And (remember) when We made this House (the Ka‘ba) a central place for mankind to turn to (and assemble) and a sanctuary for peace and (commanded:) ‘Make the place, where Ibrahim (Abraham) stood, a place of Prayer.’ And We urged Ibrahim and Isma‘il (Abraham and Ishmael): ‘Purify (and cleanse) My House for those who circumambulate it and those who go into retreat and those who kneel down and prostrate themselves.’"
The Cow,2,126,"And (recall) when Ibrahim (Abraham) prayed: ‘O my Lord, make it a city of peace and bless its residents who believe in Allah and the Last Day with a variety of fruits.’ (Allah) said: ‘And as for him who disbelieves, I shall also grant him enjoyment (for) a short span of life, then (for his disbelief) I shall drive him to the torment of Hell. And that is an extremely evil destination.’"
The Cow,2,127,"And (recall) when Ibrahim and Isma‘il (Abraham and Ishmael) were raising the foundations of the Ka‘ba (praying:) ‘O our Lord, accept this (humble service) from us. You are, indeed, All-Hearing, All-Knowing."
The Cow,2,128,"O our Lord! Make both of us submissive to Your command; and raise out of our future generations an Umma (Community) exclusively obedient to You; and teach us our ways of worship (and Pilgrimage) and turn to us (with mercy and forgiveness). Verily, it is You Who are Most Relenting, Ever-Merciful."
The Cow,2,129,"O our Lord! Raise up from amongst them the (Last and the Exalted) Messenger (Muhammad [blessings and peace be upon him]), who shall recite to them Your Revelations, and teach them the Book and wisdom (logic and good judgment, making them gnostics of the divine secret), and purify and sanctify (their hearts and ill-commanding selves). Certainly, You alone are All-Mighty, All-Wise.’"
The Cow,2,130,"And who turns away from the religion of Ibrahim (Abraham) except he who has engaged himself in foolishness? And surely, We did choose him in the worldly life, and certainly in the Hereafter (too) he will be amongst the high-ranking intimate companions."
The Cow,2,131,"And (recall) when his Lord commanded him: ‘Bow down (before Me),’ he submitted: ‘I bow down before the Lord of all the worlds.’"
The Cow,2,132,"And Ibrahim (Abraham) enjoined, by way of will, the same thing upon his sons and (so did) Ya‘qub (Jacob): ‘O my sons, verily, Allah has chosen for you the (true) Din (Religion of Islam). So, (come what may) die not but as Muslims persevering with faith.’"
The Cow,2,133,"Were you present (at the time) when death approached Ya‘qub (Jacob) when he asked his sons: ‘Whom will you worship after (my passing away)?’ They said: ‘We shall worship your God, the God of your ancestors Ibrahim (Abraham) and Isma‘il (Ishmael) and Ishaq (Isaac), Who is the One and Only God; and we (all) shall remain obedient to Him.’"
The Cow,2,134,They were an Umma (community) who have passed away. They will have what they earned and you will have what you earn. And you will not be questioned about their doings.
The Cow,2,135,"And (the People of the Book) say: ‘Become Jews or Christians, then you will be guided aright.’ Say: ‘(Nay,) the truth is that we have embraced the religion of Ibrahim (Abraham) who, far from every falsehood, turned absolutely to Allah alone. And he was not of the polytheists.’"
The Cow,2,136,"(O Muslims!) Say: ‘We believe in Allah and in that (Book) which has been revealed to us and (also) that which was revealed to Ibrahim (Abraham) and Isma‘il (Ishmael) and Ishaq (Isaac) and Ya‘qub (Jacob) and their children and those (Books) too which were given to Musa (Moses) and ‘Isa (Jesus) and (likewise) which were given to other Prophets by their Lord. We do not make distinction between any of them (in the matter of faith), and we have submitted ourselves to Him alone (the Only, the One God).’"
The Cow,2,137,"Then if they (also) believe the way you have believed in Him, then they will (surely) be guided aright. And if they turn away, then (be clear) that they are sunk in sheer enmity. So Allah is sufficient to guard you against their evil and He is All-Hearing, All-Knowing."
The Cow,2,138,"(Say that we have taken on the colour from) Allah’s own colour, and whose colour is better than Allah’s? And we worship Him alone."
The Cow,2,139,"Say: ‘Do you dispute with us about Allah, whereas He is (not only) our Lord but your Lord (too)? And to us are our works and to you are your works. And we are truly devoted to Him alone."
The Cow,2,140,"(O People of the Book!) Do you say that Ibrahim (Abraham), Isma‘il (Ishmael), Ishaq (Isaac), Ya‘qub (Jacob) and their sons were either Jews or Christians?’ Say: ‘Who knows better, you or Allah?’ And who is more unjust than he who hides the testimony which is with him (in the Book) from Allah? And Allah is not unaware of your deeds."
The Cow,2,141,That was a community which has passed. For them is what they earned and for you is what you will earn. And you will not be asked about their deeds.
The Cow,2,142,Now the foolish will say: ‘What has turned away these (Muslims) from their Qibla (Bayt al-Maqdis in Jerusalem) to which they used to face (before)?’ Say: ‘The east and the west (all) belong to Allah alone. He guides whom He pleases to the straight path.’
The Cow,2,143,"And, in the same way, (O Muslims,) We made you the best Umma (Community—fair to all with a tolerant, moderate and balanced outlook) so that you may bear witness to the people, and (Our exalted) Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) bears witness to you. And We appointed the Qibla (the direction of Prayer), which you used to face before, only to bring to light (by trial) who would follow (Our) Messenger and who would turn back upon his heels. And this (change of Qibla) was indeed a hard task, but not for those whom Allah blessed with guidance (and gnosis of spiritual truths). And it is not Allah’s Glory to void your faith (without any reason). Allah is surely Most Clement, Ever-Merciful to mankind."
The Cow,2,144,"(O Beloved!) We have been watching your radiant face turning frequently towards heaven. So We will indeed make you turn towards that Qibla (direction of Prayer) with which you feel pleased. So turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque now. And, wherever you are, (O Muslims,) turn your faces towards it. And those who have been given the Book definitely know that this (commandment of changing the Qibla) is the truth from their Lord. And Allah is not unaware of the works they are doing."
The Cow,2,145,"And (even) if you bring every sign to the People of the Book, they will not follow your Qibla (direction of Prayer), nor will you follow their Qibla. And they do not follow each other’s Qibla amongst themselves. (Said for the education of the Umma [the Community]:) ‘And if, (supposing the impossible,) you (also) followed their desires after the knowledge had come to you, then you would surely be of those who wrong (their own souls).’"
The Cow,2,146,"And those to whom We have given the Book recognize (the Final) Messenger (the Venerable Muhammad [blessings and peace be upon him] and his glory and majesty) as they doubtlessly identify their own sons. But certainly, a party of them is deliberately concealing the truth."
The Cow,2,147,"(O listener!) The truth is from your Lord. So, never be of those who doubt."
The Cow,2,148,"And there is for everyone a (fixed) direction (i.e., motive); he turns to the same. So, move forward to take the lead towards the pious acts. Wherever you are, Allah will unite you all together. Surely, Allah has absolute control over everything."
The Cow,2,149,"And from wherever you move (on a journey), turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque (at the time of Prayer). And this indeed is the truth from your Lord, and Allah is not unaware of your doings."
The Cow,2,150,"And from wherever you move (on a journey), turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque (at the time of Prayer) and, wherever you are, (O Muslims,) turn your faces towards it so that people may not get a chance to raise any objection against you, except those amongst them who exceed limits. So, fear them not, and fear Me alone, so that I complete My blessing on you and you may attain perfection in guidance."
The Cow,2,151,"Likewise, We have sent you (Our) Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) from amongst yourselves who recites to you Our Revelations and purifies and sanctifies (your hearts and ill-commanding selves) and teaches you the Book and inculcates in you logic and wisdom and enlightens you (on the mysteries of spiritual gnosis and divine truth) which you did not know."
The Cow,2,152,"So remember Me, I shall remember you. And always be thankful to Me and never be ungrateful to Me."
The Cow,2,153,"O believers! Always seek help (from Me) through patience and Prayer. Certainly, Allah is (always) with those who observe patience."
The Cow,2,154,And do not say about those who are slain in the cause of Allah that they are dead. (They are not dead.) They are rather alive but you have no perception (of their life).
The Cow,2,155,"And We will most certainly test you somewhat by means of fear and hunger and certain loss of wealth and lives and fruits. And, (O Beloved,) give glad tidings to those who observe patience."
The Cow,2,156,"(They are the ones) who, when afflicted with some distress, say: ‘Indeed, to Allah we belong and to Him we shall return.’"
The Cow,2,157,It is they upon whom are bestowed successive blessings and mercy from their Lord. And it is they who are the guided ones.
The Cow,2,158,"Verily, Safa and Marwa are indeed amongst the signs of Allah. So, he who performs ±ajj (Pilgrimage) or ‘Umra (Visitation) to the House of Allah, there is no sin on him if he ambulates (i.e., walks up and down between) the two. And if a person does a pious act voluntarily, then Allah is certainly Most Appreciative, Well Aware."
The Cow,2,159,"Surely, those who conceal the manifest signs and guidance sent down by Us after We have revealed them clearly for the people in (Our) Book, it is they whom Allah curses (i.e., deprives them of His mercy) and whom also curse all those who curse."
The Cow,2,160,"But those who repent, mend (their) ways and make known (the truth), so I (too) shall forgive them. And I am Most Relenting, Ever-Merciful."
The Cow,2,161,"Indeed, those who disbelieved (by concealing the truth), and left this world whilst they were disbelievers, upon them is the curse of Allah and of the angels and of all mankind."
The Cow,2,162,They shall be (held) under this (curse) forever. Their punishment shall not be mitigated. Nor shall they be given respite.
The Cow,2,163,"And your God is One God. There is no God but He, the Most Kind, the Ever-Merciful."
The Cow,2,164,"Verily, in the creation of the heavens and the earth, and in the alternation of the night and the day, and in the ships (and vessels) which sail through the ocean carrying cargo profitable for the people, and in the (rain)water which Allah pours down from the sky, reviving therewith the earth to life after its death, and (the earth) in which He has scattered animals of all kinds, and in the changing wind directions, and in the clouds (that trail) between the sky and the earth, duty-bound (under Allah’s command)—certainly (in these) are (many) signs (of Allah’s Power) for those who put their reason to work."
The Cow,2,165,And there are some amongst the people who take others besides Allah as His partners and love them as it is Allah’s due alone. But those who believe love Allah the most (far more intensely than anyone else). And if these wrongdoers happen to see that time when the torment (of the Last Day) will be before their eyes (then they will become aware) that the Master of all the forces is Allah. And certainly Allah is severe in punishment.
The Cow,2,166,"And when those (leaders of the disbelievers) who were followed would be disgusted with their followers and (they all) would see (Allah’s) torment and all their means and resources would be cut off,"
The Cow,2,167,"And, (seeing this disgust, the polytheist) followers will say: ‘Would that we could get a chance (to return to the world), then we (too) would turn our backs on them as they have done to us (Today)!’ In this way Allah will show them their own deeds as remorse and regret. And (no way) shall they be able to escape from Hell."
The Cow,2,168,"O mankind! Eat of that which is lawful and pure in the earth. And do not follow in the footsteps of Satan. Verily, he is your declared enemy."
The Cow,2,169,"He commands you only to do what is evil and immodest, and (also) that you should say about Allah that which you (yourselves) do not know."
The Cow,2,170,"And when it is said to them (the disbelievers): ‘Follow that which Allah has sent down,’ they say: ‘(Nay) we shall rather follow the same (path) on which we found our ancestors,’ even though their ancestors had neither any sense nor any guidance."
The Cow,2,171,"The example of inviting these disbelievers (to guidance) is like that of a person who calls out to such (an animal) as hears nothing except a shout or cry. Deaf, dumb and blind, they have no sense."
The Cow,2,172,"O believers! Eat of those pure and clean things which We have provided for you, and give thanks to Allah if He is the One Whom you worship (and obey)."
The Cow,2,173,"He has made unlawful for you only the dead animals and blood and the flesh of swine and the animal over which, whilst sacrificing, the name of someone other than Allah has been invoked. But he who is forced by necessity and is neither disobedient nor transgressing will not incur any sin on himself (if he eats that much which is required to survive). Allah is, indeed, Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful."
The Cow,2,174,"Indeed, those who conceal (those verses of the Torah) which Allah has revealed, and take in exchange for that a small price, eat nothing but fill their bellies with Fire. And Allah will neither speak to them nor purify them on the Day of Resurrection. And for them is painful torment."
The Cow,2,175,It is they who have purchased error for guidance and torment for forgiveness. What has made them steadfast to bear the Fire (of Hell)?
The Cow,2,176,This is so because Allah has revealed the Book with the truth. And indeed those who fabricate contradictions (and antinomies) in the Book are far (gone from the truth) in rivalry.
The Cow,2,177,"Righteousness is not merely that you turn your faces to the east or the west. But true righteousness is that a person believes in Allah, the Last Day, the angels, the Book (revealed by Allah) and the Messengers. Driven by love for Allah, he spends (his) wealth on the kindred, the orphans, the needy, the wayfarers and those who ask and in (liberating slaves’) necks, and establishes Prayer and pays Zakat (the Alms-due). And when they make a promise, they fulfil it and are steadfast in hardship (i.e., poverty) and suffering (i.e., ailment) and at the time of fierce fighting (i.e., jihad). It is these who are truthful and it is these who are righteous."
The Cow,2,178,"O believers! Retribution (the law of equality in punishment) is prescribed for you in the case of those who are unjustly slain: a free man for a free man, a slave for a slave and a woman for a woman. Then, if he (the murderer) is granted some remission (in retribution) by his brother (the victim’s heir), that should be executed fairly according to the law, and (retribution) should be paid (to the heirs of the slain) in a graceful manner. This is a concession and kindness from your Lord. So, anyone who transgresses after that, there is painful torment for him."
The Cow,2,179,"And there is a (guarantee of) life for you in retribution (i.e., vengeance of murder), O wise people, so that you may guard (against bloodshed and destruction)."
The Cow,2,180,"It is prescribed for you that when death approaches someone of you, and he leaves some property behind, then he is to make a will for (his) parents and kindred in a reasonable manner. This is imperative for the true believers."
The Cow,2,181,"Then he who alters this (will) after hearing it, its sin will be on those who alter it. Allah is indeed All-Hearing, All-Knowing."
The Cow,2,182,"So, if a person fears any partiality by a testator (for someone) or injustice (towards some other), and then brings about reconciliation amongst them, it shall be no sin on him. Verily, Allah is Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful."
The Cow,2,183,O believers! Fasting is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for the people before you so that you may become pious.
The Cow,2,184,"(These are) a fixed number of days. So, whoever amongst you is ill or on a journey, then he shall complete fasting for the fixed number by (fasting on) other days. But those who are not able to fast, it is obligatory on them to provide food for a needy person in lieu of that. But whoever does (greater) good seeking pleasure, that is better for him. And your fasting is better for you if you understand."
The Cow,2,185,"The month of Ramadan (is the month) in which the Qur’an has been sent down as guidance for mankind containing clear signs which lead (to the straight road) and distinguishing (the truth from falsehood). Therefore, he who witnesses this month must fast it, and he who is ill or on a journey should complete the count by (fasting on equal number of) other days. Allah desires ease for you and does not desire hardship for you so that you complete the prescribed number of fasting days, and that you glorify Him for the guidance which He has blessed you with, and that you may become grateful."
The Cow,2,186,"And, (O Beloved,) when My servants ask you about Me, (tell them:) ‘I am near. I reply the call of the supplicant whenever he calls Me out. So they should embrace My obedience and have (firm) faith in Me so that they may find the (coveted) road (leading straight to the destination).’"
The Cow,2,187,"It is made lawful for you to approach your wives during the nights of the fasts. They are like clothes for you and you are like clothes for them. Allah knows that you broke the trust in the case of your own right. But He has shown mercy to you and has forgiven you. So, have sexual relations with them now (during the nights of the fasts without any inhibition) and seek what Allah has prescribed for you. And eat and drink until the white thread of dawn becomes distinct to you (separated) from the black thread (of night). Then complete the fast till dusk. And refrain from having sexual contact with your wives, whilst you are in retreat in the mosques. These are the bounds (set) by Allah. So do not draw near to them (to step over). Thus Allah explains His Verses (clearly) for the people, so that they may embrace piety."
The Cow,2,188,"And do not eat up one another’s wealth amongst yourselves through injustice, nor take wealth to the authorities (as a bribe) so that, this way, you may (also) swallow a portion of others’ wealth unfairly, whilst you are aware (that this is a sin)."
The Cow,2,189,"(O Beloved!) People ask you about the new moons. Say: ‘These are signs to indicate time for the people and for (determining) the month of ±ajj (Pilgrimage).’ And it is not righteousness that you enter your houses from the rear (whilst in ihram—the sacred dress for ±ajj). In fact, righteousness is doing pious acts (instead of observing such meaningless customs). And enter your houses through their (entrance) doors, and always fear Allah so that you may prosper."
The Cow,2,190,"And fight (in defence) in the cause of Allah against those who impose war on you. (Yes,) but do not exceed limits. Surely, Allah does not like those who exceed limits."
The Cow,2,191,"And (during war) kill (the aggressing and combating disbelievers) wherever you find them, and drive them out (through military operation by the state) from where they drove you out. And rousing mischief and disruption is a severer (crime) than killing. But do not fight against them in the proximity of the Sacred Mosque (Ka‘ba) unless they themselves fight there against you. Then if they attack you, kill them (in defence), for that is the right penalty of (such aggressing and combating) disbelievers."
The Cow,2,192,"But if they desist, then surely Allah is Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful."
The Cow,2,193,"And keep fighting against them until the disruption and mischief is totally eliminated and the Din (Religion) practically becomes subservient to Allah alone (i.e., the system of the protection of peace, security and human rights is practically established). But if they desist, then offensive action is not permissible except against the wrongdoers (i.e., transgressors)."
The Cow,2,194,"A sacred month is the requital of a sacred month, and (other) sacred things also requite one another. So if someone wrongs you, you may also respond in kind but proportional to his offence. And fear Allah. And remember that Allah is with those who fear Him."
The Cow,2,195,"And spend in the cause of Allah; and do not cast yourselves into destruction with your own hands; and adopt righteousness. Verily, Allah loves the righteous."
The Cow,2,196,"And accomplish (the ceremonies of) ±ajj (Pilgrimage) and ‘Umra (Visitation) for Allah. But if you are prevented (on the way), then (send for slaughter) whatever sacrificial animal is available. And do not shave your heads until the sacrificial animal has reached its place. But whoever amongst you is ill or suffers from some ailment of the head (and because of that gets his head shaved before time), then he has to recompense (it) by (keeping) fasts or (giving) alms or (offering) sacrifice. Then, when in peaceful condition, anyone of you who takes the advantage of combining ‘Umra (Visitation) with ±ajj (Pilgrimage) should (offer whatever) sacrifice is available. However, the one who fails to manage even this shall fast for three days during ±ajj ([Pilgrimage] days) and for seven days on returning from ±ajj, making ten days (fasting) in all. This (dispensation) is meant for the one whose family does not reside in the vicinity of the Sacred Mosque (i.e., not a resident of Mecca). And fear Allah and remember that Allah gives severe punishment."
The Cow,2,197,"Some months are appointed for ±ajj (Pilgrimage: Shawwal, Dhu al-Qa‘da and first ten days of Dhu al-Hijja). So, he who undertakes to perform ±ajj (Pilgrimage) during these (months) and makes it obligatory (for himself) must not commit sexual intercourse with the women, nor any (other) sin, nor should he quarrel with anyone during the ±ajj (Pilgrimage) days. And whatever good you do, Allah knows it well. And collect the provisions required for the journey (to the Hereafter). And surely the best of provisions is the fear of Allah. So, fear Me, O men of sound judgment!"
The Cow,2,198,"And it is no sin on you if you (also) seek your Lord’s bounty (through trade during the ±ajj days). Then when you return from ‘Arafat, celebrate the remembrance of Allah near Mash‘ar al-Haram (Muzdalifa). And remember Him as He has guided you. And you were certainly wandering disorientated before."
The Cow,2,199,"Then return after going to that very place from where (the other) people return. And (earnestly) beg forgiveness from Allah. Allah is, of course, Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful."
The Cow,2,200,"Then, when you have completed the ceremonies of ±ajj (Pilgrimage), celebrate the remembrance of Allah most fervently (at Mina), as you remember your fathers and forefathers (with great fondness), or remember (Allah) with even deeper intensity of fondness. There are some of the people who say: ‘O our Lord, grant us benefits in this (very) world.’ For such there is no share in the Hereafter."
The Cow,2,201,"And there are others of them who submit: ‘O our Lord, grant us excellence in this world, and excellence in the Hereafter (as well), and save us from the torment of Hell.’"
The Cow,2,202,"It is they for whom there is a share of their (virtuous) earning, and Allah is Swift at reckoning."
The Cow,2,203,"And remember Allah (the most) during (these) numbered days. Then, if someone hastens just in two days (to return from Mina), it is no sin on him, and he who delays (it) also commits no sin. This is for him who embraces piety. And keep fearing Allah, and remember that all of you shall be assembled before Him."
The Cow,2,204,"And amongst people there is also someone whose conversation seems pleasing to you in the life of the world, and who calls Allah to witness that which is in his heart, but in truth he is most quarrelsome."
The Cow,2,205,"And when he turns away (from you), he runs about in the land to do (everything possible) to rouse mischief and destroy crops and life. And Allah does not like mischief and violence."
The Cow,2,206,"And when it is said to him (on account of this tyranny and violence): ‘Fear Allah,’ his arrogance stimulates him for more sins. Hell is, therefore, sufficient for him. And that is indeed an evil abode."
The Cow,2,207,And (on the contrary) amongst people there is also someone who sells even his life to attain the pleasure of Allah. And Allah is Most Kind to the servants.
The Cow,2,208,"O believers! Enter Islam perfectly and wholly, and do not follow in the footsteps of Satan. He is certainly your declared enemy."
The Cow,2,209,"And if you err even after Our clear signs have come to you, then bear in mind that Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise."
The Cow,2,210,"Are they waiting only for (the torment of) Allah to come in the coverings of clouds, and also the angels (to descend), and the (whole) affair is settled? And to Allah will all matters be returned."
The Cow,2,211,"Ask the Children of Israel how many a clear sign We gave them! But he who alters Allah’s bounty after it has reached him, then Allah surely inflicts severe torment."
The Cow,2,212,The worldly life has been quite adorned and beautified for the disbelievers. And they make fun of the believers. But those who have embraced Godwariness will rank far superior to them on the Day of Resurrection. And Allah gives without measure to whom He wills.
The Cow,2,213,"(In the beginning) all the people agreed upon the same Din (Religion. And later, when differences emerged amongst them,) Allah sent His Messengers as Bearers of good news and Warners and sent down with them the Book based on truth, so that it might judge those matters amongst the people in which they had developed differences. Then, only those very people whom the Book was given differed about it, despite the fact that the clear signs had come to them. (And they differed also) because of mere jealousy and malice amongst themselves. Then Allah, by His command, made the believers understand that matter of truth about which they had differed. And Allah guides whom He pleases to the straight road."
The Cow,2,214,"Do you think that you will enter Paradise (for nothing, without any trial,) whilst you have not yet undergone the predicament of those who passed away before you? They were afflicted with a diversity of sufferings and hardships and were jolted (in such a manner) that the Messenger (himself) and his companions in faith (too) cried out: ‘When will the help of Allah arrive?’ Beware! The help of Allah is definitely at hand."
The Cow,2,215,"They ask you what they should spend (in the way of Allah). Say: ‘Whatever wealth you spend (is right), but the deserving ones are your parents and close relatives and orphans and the needy and the wayfarers. And whatever good you do, Allah indeed knows it full well.’"
The Cow,2,216,"Fighting (in self-defence, for restoration of peace and elimination of mischief and violence) has been made incumbent upon you although you are averse to it by temperament. It may be that you dislike a thing and (in fact) that is good for you. And it is (also) likely that you like a thing but (in fact) that is bad for you. And Allah knows well but you do not know."
The Cow,2,217,"They ask you about the command for fighting in the Sacred Month. Say: ‘Fighting in it is a grave sin, but hindering people from Allah’s path and denying Him and obstructing them from al-Masjid al-Haram (Ka‘ba) and turning its dwellers out of it is yet a graver sin (than that) in the sight of Allah.’ And this mischief-mongering is even worse than bloodshed. (These disbelievers) will continue fighting against you endlessly till they turn you back from your Din (Religion) if they become capable to gain (the required) might. And whoever of you turns away from his Din (Religion) and dies as a disbeliever, (all) deeds of such people will become void in this world and in the Hereafter. And it is they who are the inmates of Hell. They shall dwell in it forever."
The Cow,2,218,"Indeed, those who believed and migrated for the sake of Allah and struggled hard in the way of Allah, it is they who look forward to Allah’s mercy. And Allah is Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful."
The Cow,2,219,"They ask you about alcohol (i.e., intoxicants) and gambling. Say: ‘Major sin lies in both of them and also some (worldly) profit for the people, but their sin is greater than their profit.’ And they also ask you about what they should spend. Say: ‘(Spend) whatever is surplus to your needs.’ Thus does Allah make His commandments clear to you so that you may meditate."
The Cow,2,220,"(Your meditation should be) on (matters relating to) this world and the Hereafter. And they ask you about orphans. Say: ‘It is meritorious to set (their affairs) right. And if you associate them with yourselves (in subsistence and business), then they are also your brothers. And Allah distinctly recognizes the one who is destructive from the other who is constructive. And if Allah willed, He would put you in distress. Verily, Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise.’"
The Cow,2,221,"And do not marry idolatrous women until they become Muslims. Indeed, a Muslim slave-girl is better than a (free) idolatress, however pleasing she may seem to you. Nor give (the Muslim women) in marriage to idolaters till they embrace Islam. And certainly, a Muslim slave is better than an idolater, even though he should please you. These (idolaters and disbelievers) call you to Hell whilst Allah invites, by His decree, to Paradise and forgiveness and explains His Verses clearly to people so that they may take direction and guidance."
The Cow,2,222,"And they ask you about menstruation. Say: ‘It is filth; so keep away from women during menstruation and do not approach them until they become pure. And when they have washed themselves clean, consort with them the way by which Allah has permitted you.’ Undoubtedly, Allah loves those who repent much, and He loves those who keep themselves thoroughly pure and clean."
The Cow,2,223,"Your wives are for you like a harvest-producing field. So, go to your field as you may desire. And manage some provisions for yourselves for the next world. Inculcate in yourselves the fear of Allah, and be mindful that you shall appear before Him. And, (O Beloved,) give good news to the believers (that their appearance before Allah will be gainful for them)."
The Cow,2,224,"And because of your oaths, do not use (the Name of) Allah as an excuse for refraining from doing good (to the people), becoming Godfearing and making peace amongst people. And Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing."
The Cow,2,225,"Allah will not hold you accountable for your vain oaths, but will take you to task for the oaths taken with serious intention in your hearts. And Allah is Most Forgiving, Most Forbearing."
The Cow,2,226,"And for those who swear not to go near their wives, there is a (reconsideration) period of four months. So, if (during this period) they resume their relations, Allah is Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful."
The Cow,2,227,"But if they resolve firmly to divorce, then certainly Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing."
The Cow,2,228,"And the divorced women shall hold themselves back till three menstrual cycles. And it is not lawful for them to conceal what Allah may have created in their wombs if they believe in Allah and the Last Day. And during this period, their husbands have a greater right to take them back (again) into conjugal bond, provided they intend to reconcile. And, according to usage, women too have rights over men similar to the rights of men over women. Men, however, have an advantage over them. And Allah is All-Mighty, Most Wise."
The Cow,2,229,"Divorce is (revocable) two times (only). Then either retain (the wife) with honour (in marital relationship) or release her with kindness. And it is not lawful for you to take back anything of that which you have given them, unless both fear that (now by maintaining marital ties) they may not be able to observe the limits set by Allah. So if you fear that both will be unable to keep within Allah’s limits, then (in that case) there shall be no sin upon either of them if the wife (herself) may give up something as recompense to free herself (from this distressing bond). These are the limits (set) by Allah. So, do not exceed them. And those who exceed the limits prescribed by Allah, it is they who are the wrongdoers."
The Cow,2,230,"Then if he divorces (for the third time), she will not be lawful for him until she marries some husband other than him. But if he (the latter) also divorces her, in such a case there shall be no sin on both of them (the former husband and the wife) if they return (once more to the wedlock), provided both of them (now) think that they would be able to observe the limits set by Allah. And these are the limits (prescribed) by Allah which He explains to those who have knowledge."
The Cow,2,231,"And when you divorce the women, and they reach (the completion of) their waiting period, then either retain them (in marital bond) in a graceful manner or release them nicely. But do not retain them to hurt (them) so that you subject (them) to excesses. And he who does so wrongs his own soul. And do not make fun of Allah’s commands. And call to mind Allah’s favour that has been (bestowed) upon you, and the Book that He has sent down to you, and (the pearls of) wisdom (with which He has enlightened you). He advises you (by means of this code of conduct). And fear Allah, and bear in mind that Allah is indeed All-Knowing."
The Cow,2,232,"And when you divorce the women and they reach (the completion of) their waiting period, then do not prevent them from remarrying (their former or latter) husbands when they have mutually agreed according to the Islamic law. This is a direction for him amongst you who believes in Allah and the Last Day. It is most pure, clean and wholesome for you. And Allah knows and you do not know (so many things)."
The Cow,2,233,"And the mothers shall suckle their infants for two full years. This (injunction) is for him who wants to complete the suckling period. And, according to usage, the food and clothing of the feeding mothers is the obligation of the father of the child. No soul should be stressed beyond its capacity, (and) neither the mother nor the father should be harmed for the child. The same injunction is applicable to the heirs. Then if both the mother and the father desire with mutual consultation and consent to wean (even before the fixed two years), there will be no sin on them. Nor shall it be a sin if you intend to engage (wet nurses) for suckling the children, whilst you pay them whatever you do according to usage. And fear Allah and know that Allah is Watchful of all that you do."
The Cow,2,234,"And those of you who die and leave (their) widows behind shall keep themselves in waiting for four months and ten days. So, when they arrive at (the end of) their waiting term, there shall be no responsibility on you for whatever they do for themselves according to Islamic law. And Allah is Well Aware of what you do."
The Cow,2,235,"And there is no sin on you if (even during the waiting term) you convey to such women a hint of marriage proposal or conceal (this idea) in your hearts. Allah knows that you will soon mention to them, but do not seek from them any (such) promise even secretly, except that you say to them (a hint of) that according to Islamic law. And do not resolve firmly on wedlock (during this time) until the prescribed waiting term is over. And know that Allah also knows what is in your hearts. So fear Him persistently. And (also) know that Allah is Most Forgiving, Most Lenient."
The Cow,2,236,There will (also) be no sin on you if you divorce (the wedlocked) women even before touching them or fixing their dower. Then (in this case) provide for them appropriately. It is (an obligation) for the rich according to his means and for the poor according to his means. (In any case) this provision must be made in a becoming manner. This is compulsory for the pious.
The Cow,2,237,"And if you divorce them before you have touched them, after you have fixed a dower for them, then paying half of the dower you have fixed is necessary, unless they forgo (their right) themselves, or the (husband) in whose hand is the marriage tie forgoes (i.e., pays more than half or full). And, (O male folk,) if you forgo, that is closer to Godwariness. And never forget extending generosity (and behaving excellently) towards each other (even in these moments of stress and strain). Verily, Allah observes well what you do."
The Cow,2,238,"Guard strictly all the Prayers, especially the middle Prayer. And stand before Allah as an epitome of submissiveness and lowliness."
The Cow,2,239,"Should you be in a state of fear, then (do offer Prayer) whether on foot or whilst riding (as the case may be), but once you get back to peace, remember Allah in the manner He has taught you which you did not know (before)."
The Cow,2,240,"And those of you who die and leave (their) widows behind must leave a will for their widows (before they die) to provide them for their maintenance for one year (and) not to turn them out of their houses. But if they themselves walk out (on their own), then there is no sin on you for whatever they may do for themselves according to usage. And Allah is Almighty, Most Wise."
The Cow,2,241,And the divorced women must also be provided with maintenance according to what is fair. This is compulsory for the pious.
The Cow,2,242,Thus Allah makes His commandments clear to you so that you may understand.
The Cow,2,243,"(O Beloved!) Have you not seen the people who went out of their houses, fearing death, though they were in thousands? Allah commanded them: ‘Die,’ (and they died). Then He restored them to life. Surely, Allah is Most Bountiful towards mankind, but most of them do not give (Him) thanks."
The Cow,2,244,"And, (O Muslims,) fight in the way of Allah (to establish peace and safeguard human dignity) and know that Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing."
The Cow,2,245,"Who is he that will lend to Allah a generous loan? He will, then, multiply it for him manifold. And Allah alone decreases and increases (your sustenance) and towards Him will you be returned."
The Cow,2,246,"(O Beloved!) Have you not seen the group of the Children of Israel who came after Musa (Moses)? When they said to their Prophet: ‘Appoint for us a king so that we may fight in the cause of Allah (under his command),’ the Prophet said (to them): ‘What, if you desist from fighting, once it is prescribed for you!’ They said: ‘What ails us that we should not fight in the cause of Allah when we have been driven away from our homes and children?’ But when fighting (against oppression and aggression) was made obligatory for them, all of them turned away, except a few. And Allah knows the wrongdoers full well."
The Cow,2,247,"And their Prophet said to them: ‘Allah has appointed for you Talut (Saul) as a king.’ They said: ‘How can he reign over us, whereas we have greater right than him to rule, and he has also not been granted affluence?’ (The Prophet) said: ‘Surely, Allah has chosen him above you, and has given him more affluent knowledge and vigour; and Allah (entrusts) with His kingdom whom He pleases and Allah is Infinite, All-Knowing.’"
The Cow,2,248,"And their Prophet said to them: ‘The sign of his kingdom (to be Allah’s bestowal) is that a box, carried by angels, shall come to you from your Lord, containing things for the tranquillity of heart, and some sacred relics left behind by the children of Musa and Harun (Moses and Aaron). Surely, there is a great sign in it for you if you are believers.’"
The Cow,2,249,"So, when Talut (Saul) marched out of the city with his troops, he said: ‘Surely, Allah will try you by means of a stream. So he who drinks from it will not be (of my companions), and he who does not drink it will be of (my party), but if someone takes (only) a sip of it from the hollow of his hand (there is no harm).’ Yet, they all drank of it except a few. So, when Talut (Saul) and his companions in faith crossed the stream, they said: ‘We have no strength today to face Jalut (Goliath) and his forces.’ (But) those who were sure that (after martyrdom or death) they were going to meet Allah said: ‘Many a time a small party has overcome a (very) large party by the command of Allah! And Allah awards His companionship to the steadfast.’"
The Cow,2,250,"And when they faced Jalut (Goliath) and his forces, they supplicated Allah: ‘O our Lord, grant us plentiful patience and make our steps firm and give us victory over the disbelievers.’"
The Cow,2,251,"So they defeated them (the army of Jalut [Goliath]) by Allah’s command and Dawud (David) killed Jalut. And Allah granted (Dawud) sovereignty and wisdom, and taught him what He wished. If Allah had not removed one group (that puts into force tyranny and oppression and breaches peace) by means of another (who fights for the protection of human dignity, life on) earth would have been ruined. But Allah is Bountiful to all the worlds."
The Cow,2,252,These are Allah’s Verses. (O Beloved!) We recite them to you with the truth and indeed you are of the Messengers.
The Cow,2,253,"Of all these Messengers (whom We sent) We have exalted some above others: Allah spoke to some of them (directly), and raised some (above all others) in rank (i.e., elevated the Holy Prophet [blessings and peace be upon him] to the highest of all the degrees of the glory of Messengership). And We gave ‘Isa, the son of Maryam (Jesus, the son of Mary), clear signs and helped him with the Holy Spirit. And had Allah so willed, the people succeeding these Messengers would never have disputed and fought amongst themselves after the manifest signs had come to them. But they differed (owing to the free will which was endowed to them to be answerable before Allah for their performance). So, some of them believed whilst others opted to disbelieve. (And keep it in mind that) if Allah had willed (i.e., restricted their choice to one opinion only), they would never have fought amongst themselves. But Allah does what He wills (i.e., He gives the people freedom of choice and makes them responsible for their decision)."
The Cow,2,254,"O believers! Spend (in the cause of Allah) out of whatever We have provided for you, before the Day comes when there will be no trading; and (for disbelievers) neither any friendship (will be useful) nor (any) intercession; and it is the disbelievers who are the transgressors."
The Cow,2,255,"Allah! None is worthy of worship but He, the Ever-Living, the Self-Subsisting, the One Who sustains and protects (the entire universe with His strategy). He is seized by neither slumber nor sleep. Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth belongs to Him alone. Who can dare intercede with Him except by His permission? (He) knows all that is (happening or has happened) before the Creation, and all that is (about to happen) after them; and they cannot encompass anything of His knowledge except that which He wills. His Throne (of Empire and Power and Authority) encompasses the heavens and the earth, and the protection of both (the earth and the heavens) does not pose Him any difficulty. And He alone is Most High, Most Great."
The Cow,2,256,"There is no compulsion in Din (Religion). Surely, the guidance has been evidently distinguished from error. So he who rejects false gods and believes in Allah has grasped such a firm handhold that will never (possibly) give way. And Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing."
The Cow,2,257,"Allah is the Guardian of the believers. He brings them out of (all kinds of) darkness and takes them towards the light. And those who are disbelievers, their supporters are satans who take them out of the light (of truth) into the darkness (of evil). It is they who are the inmates of Hell. They will dwell there forever."
The Cow,2,258,"(O Beloved!) Have you not seen him who began to dispute with Ibrahim (Abraham) about his own Lord because Allah had given him the kingdom? When Ibrahim (Abraham) said: ‘My Lord is He Who gives life and (also) causes death,’ (the king) said (in reply): ‘I (too) give life and cause death.’ Ibrahim (Abraham) said: ‘Surely, Allah causes the sun to rise in the east; bring it up from the west.’ So, the infidel was stunned. And Allah does not guide the transgressors to the right path."
The Cow,2,259,"Or, likewise, (have you not seen) him who passed by a town which was a wreck with its roofs caved in? He said: ‘How shall Allah bring it back to life after its death?’ So (to make him witness His Power) Allah kept him dead for a hundred years, then gave him life, (and after that) asked: ‘How long (have) you stayed here (after dying)?’ He said: ‘I stayed for a day or (only) part of a day.’ Allah said: ‘(Nay,) you kept lying for a hundred years. So, (now) look at (the provisions of) your food and drink. (They) have not even decomposed (i.e., become stale). And (now) see your donkey (whose very bones are no more intact). And this is because We may make you a sign (of Our Might) for the people. And (now) see (these) bones how We stir (and raise) them and clothe them with flesh.’ When this (phenomenon) fully dawned on him, he proclaimed: ‘I have learnt (through the eye of certitude) that Allah is indeed All-Powerful to do everything.’"
The Cow,2,260,"And (also recall) when Ibrahim (Abraham) said: ‘My Lord, show me how You bring the dead to life.’ Allah said: ‘Do you not have faith?’ He submitted: ‘Why not! (I do believe,) but (I wish) my heart is blessed with gratifying calm.’ Allah ordained: ‘Well, take four birds and tame them to feel attached to you; then (slaughter them and) place a piece of each of them on each hill; then call them. They will come to you at high speed. And know that surely Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise.’"
The Cow,2,261,"The example of those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah is like (that) grain out of which seven ears shoot forth. (And then) each ear bears a hundred grains (i.e., they are rewarded seven hundred times). And Allah multiplies (still more) for whom He likes. And Allah is Infinite, All-Knowing."
The Cow,2,262,"Those who spend their wealth in the cause of Allah, and then do not follow up their spending by reminding of their benevolence or by hurting, there is reward for them with their Lord. And (on the Day of Resurrection) they will have no fear, nor will they grieve."
The Cow,2,263,"Polite conversation (with the needy) and extending tolerance are far better than charity followed by injuring (his) heart. And Allah is Self-Sufficient, Forbearing."
The Cow,2,264,"O believers! Do not ruin your charity donations (later) by taunts of doing favour and hurting feelings like the one who gives charity to show off his wealth to the people and believes in neither Allah nor the Last Day. His case is like a smooth rock covered with a thin coat of soil. Then heavy rain falls on it, washes it clean and leaves it (the same) bare and hard (rock). So these (pretentious people) shall get nothing out of their earning. And Allah does not guide the disbelievers."
The Cow,2,265,"And those who spend their wealth to seek Allah’s pleasure and stabilize themselves (in faith and obedience) are like a garden located on a higher ground level. When a heavy rain falls on it, it doubles its yield. And if it does not receive a heavy rain, then even dew (or drizzle) is sufficient. And Allah monitors your actions minutely."
The Cow,2,266,"Would any of you like to have a garden of date-palms and grapevines with streams flowing beneath it and all kinds of fruit (in addition to dates and grapes); and (under these conditions) old age overtakes him, whilst his children are (still) tender; and (in the meanwhile) the garden is struck with a whirlwind composed (entirely) of fire and gets burnt? (Imagine the state of his helplessness, agony and anxiety.) Thus Allah makes clear His signs for you so that you may reflect. (So, do you wish that the orchard of your deeds should also burn to ashes in the fire of pretentiousness on the Last Day, and there should be none to support you?)"
The Cow,2,267,"O believers! Spend (in the way of Allah) of your lawful and clean earnings and of that which We bring forth for you from the earth. And do not intend to spend (in the cause of Allah) from that which is unclean, for (if the same is given to you,) you yourselves would never accept it without closing your eyes to it. And you must know that Allah is certainly All-Sufficient, Worthy of All Praise."
The Cow,2,268,"Satan makes you afraid of poverty (to stop you from spending in the way of Allah) and enjoins you to commit indecency. And Allah promises you His forgiveness and bounty. And Allah is All-Embracing, All-Knowing."
The Cow,2,269,He blesses with wisdom whom He wills. And he who is granted wisdom (and reason) receives tremendous good. And only those who are endowed with wisdom and insight receive direction and guidance.
The Cow,2,270,"And whatever you spend or whatever you vow to offer, Allah verily knows it and the evildoers have no helpers."
The Cow,2,271,"If you give charity in public, it is worthwhile (for it will persuade others), but if you hide and deliver it to the poor in secret, that is (far) better for you. And Allah will remove from you some of your sins (due to this charity). And Allah is Well Aware of all that you do."
The Cow,2,272,"Their (acceptance) of guidance is not your responsibility. It is Allah Who awards guidance to whom He wills. And whatever wealth you give away (as charity donation) goes to your own benefit. It is not appropriate for you to spend but for Allah’s pleasure alone. And whatever you spend of your wealth, (its reward) will be paid back to you in full and you shall not be treated unjustly."
The Cow,2,273,"(Charity is) the right of those poor who have been restricted (from earning their livelihood) in the cause of Allah. They cannot even move about in the land (due to their whole time involvement in matters of Din [Religion]). Because of their (ascetic) aversion to greed, the unwise (knowing little about their state of heart and soul) consider them wealthy. You will recognize them from their appearance. They do not ask people (for help) at all lest they should humble themselves (before them). And whatever wealth you give in charity, Allah indeed knows it well."
The Cow,2,274,"Those who spend (in the cause of Allah) by night and day, privately or publicly, have their reward with their Lord. And (on the Day of Resurrection) they shall neither fear nor grieve."
The Cow,2,275,"Those who live on usury will not be able to stand (on the Day of Judgment), but like the one whom Satan has made insane with his touch (i.e., damnation). This is because they used to say that trade (i.e., buying and selling) is similar to usury, whereas Allah has declared trade (i.e., buying and selling) lawful and usury unlawful. So, if someone refrains (from usury) on receiving admonition from his Lord, then he can keep whatever he took in the past and his case is with Allah. But those who continued with usury (despite the admonition) would be the inmates of Hell. They will abide there permanently."
The Cow,2,276,"Allah eliminates usury (i.e., deprives usurious profits of prosperous growth) and multiplies alms gifts (i.e., increases blessings of clean wealth manifold through charity donations). And Allah does not like anyone who is ungrateful and disobedient."
The Cow,2,277,"Surely, those who believe and do pious acts and establish Prayer and pay Zakat (the Alms-due) regularly have their reward with their Lord. And (on the Last Day) they will neither fear nor grieve."
The Cow,2,278,O believers! Fear Allah and write off whatever balance remains of usury if you are believers (true to the core of your hearts).
The Cow,2,279,"But if you do not do so, then be warned of the declaration of war from Allah and His Holy Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him). And if you repent, then your principal amounts are (lawfully) yours. (In this case) you will neither do any wrong, nor be wronged."
The Cow,2,280,"And if a debtor is under financial stress, he should be given respite till he feels at ease to pay. And your forgoing (the loan) is better for you if you know (what significance it has in the sight of Allah to console the poor)."
The Cow,2,281,"And fear the Day when you will be returned to Allah. Then everyone will be paid in full for whatever he has done, and they will not be wronged."
The Cow,2,282,"O believers! Whenever you strike deals with one another for a fixed period, reduce the transaction to writing. And the scribe amongst you should write it with justice, and should not refuse to write as Allah has taught him to write. So he should write (i.e., meet the requirements of documentation with utmost honesty, in accordance with Islamic law). And he on whom the liability (i.e., debt) falls should dictate the contents of the contract. And he should fear Allah, Who is his Sustainer, and (whilst writing) he should not diminish anything (from the indebted sum). Then if he who has undertaken the liability is mentally deficient or physically weak or lacks the ability to dictate the contents, his guardian should dictate with fairness. And get two witnesses out of your own men. But if two men are not available, then a man and two women: (they) should be from amongst those whom you like as witnesses (i.e., consider trustworthy), so that if either of the two women forgets, the other may remind her. And the witnesses should not refuse whenever they are called (for evidence). And do not be weary of writing it down for its term, whether the transaction is small or large. This documentation by you is more just in the sight of Allah, and makes evidence more solid and nearer to keeping you from doubt, except that if transactions are hand-to-hand which you carry out amongst yourselves, then there is no sin on you if you do not write it down. And take witnesses whenever you bargain amongst yourselves. And let no harm be done to either the scribe or the witness, but if you do so, it will be sheer disobedience on your part. And keep fearing Allah. And Allah grants you knowledge (of the principles of mutual dealing) and Allah knows everything well."
The Cow,2,283,"And if you are on a journey and do not find a scribe, then take possession of a pledge in mortgage. Then, if one of you trusts the other, so he whose honesty has been trusted should deliver his trust and fear Allah, Who provides him subsistence. And do not conceal evidence. And the one who conceals it, his heart is certainly sinful. And Allah knows well whatever you do."
The Cow,2,284,"Whatever exists in the heavens and the earth belongs to Allah. Whether you reveal or conceal the secrets of your heart, Allah will call you to account for that. Then Allah shall forgive whom He wills and torment whom He wills. And Allah has Absolute Power over everything."
The Cow,2,285,"(He) the Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) believed in (i.e., affirmed) what was revealed to him by his Lord, and so have done the believers. All embraced faith (from the core of their hearts) in Allah, His angels, His Books and His Messengers. (They also say:) ‘We do not differentiate between any of His Messengers (in believing).’ And they submit (before His holy presence): ‘We have heard (Your command) and (accepted to) obey. ‘O our Lord! We seek Your forgiveness and to You (we all) have to return.’"
The Cow,2,286,"Allah does not put under stress any soul more than its endurance. There is a reward for whatever good it has earned, and there is torment for whatever evil it has perpetrated. ‘O our Lord, do not take us to task if we forget or do some mistake. O our Lord, lay not on us such a (heavy) burden as You laid on those before us. O our Lord, put not on us (also) the burden that we have not the strength to bear, and overlook (our sins), and forgive us and have mercy on us. You alone are our Master and Helper. So grant us victory over the disbelievers.’"
The Family of 'Imrân,3,1,"Alif, Lam, Mim. (Only Allah and the Messenger [blessings and peace be upon him] know the real meaning.)"
The Family of 'Imrân,3,2,"Allah! None is worthy of worship but He, the Ever-Living, Self-Subsisting and Sustainer (of the entire universe with His Strategy)."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,3,(O Beloved!) He is the One Who has revealed to you (this) Book with truth. (It) confirms (all those Books) that were revealed before it. And He is the One Who has revealed the Torah and the Injil (the Gospel).
The Family of 'Imrân,3,4,"(As the Books were revealed) before this to guide the people, He has (now, in like manner,) revealed (the Qur’an,) the criterion to distinguish right from wrong. Verily, those who deny Allah’s Revelations, for them is rigorous punishment. And Allah is Almighty, the Lord of Retribution."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,5,"Surely, nothing is hidden from Allah in the earth or in the heaven."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,6,"He is the One Who shapes your forms the way He wills in the wombs (of mothers). None is worthy of worship but He. He is Almighty, All-Wise."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,7,"He is the One Who has revealed to you the Book comprising some firm and solid Verses (i.e., literally clear and precise in meaning); they are the foundation of (the commandments) of the Book. And other Verses are figurative (i.e., containing abstract and allusive meaning). So, those who have deviation in their hearts follow only its figurative Verses (just) under the urge to create disruption and with the motive to supply them self-seeking interpretation instead of their true interpretation. But none knows its true interpretation apart from Allah. And those who are perfectly firm in knowledge say: ‘We believe in it. The whole (Book) has been revealed by our Lord.’ And direction and guidance is the share of only those who possess wisdom and insight."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,8,"(And they submit:) ‘O our Lord, let not our hearts deviate after You have honoured us with guidance, and grant us mercy especially from Your presence. Truly, You alone are the Great Bestower."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,9,"O our Lord! You will surely bring together mankind on the Day about which there is no doubt. Verily, Allah does not go against (His) promise.’"
The Family of 'Imrân,3,10,"Indeed, those who reject faith, neither their wealth nor their children shall be able to save them anyway from (the torment of) Allah. It is they who are the fuel of Hell."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,11,"(Their) line of action (also) resembles that of the people of Pharaoh and those before them who belied Our Revelations. So, Allah seized them because of their sins and Allah gives severe punishment."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,12,"Say to the disbelievers: ‘You will soon be overpowered and driven towards Hell, and that is a very evil abode.’"
The Family of 'Imrân,3,13,"There is certainly a sign for you in the two parties that encountered each other (in the battlefield of Badr)—one party (i.e., the Muslims) fought (a defensive war) in the cause of Allah, and the other comprised the disbelievers (i.e., the Meccan aggressors who invaded the peaceful Muslims of Medina). They saw them with their (own) eyes as twice their own number. And Allah provides strength with His reinforcement to whom He wills. In this incident, there is surely a (notable) lesson of warning for those who have eyes."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,14,"(Excessively) attractive has been made, for the people, the love of lusts (that) include women, children, and hoarded treasures of gold and silver, and branded horses and cattle and crops. (All) this is the provision of the worldly life and with Allah is the best abode."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,15,"(O Beloved!) Say: ‘Shall I give you the news of something far better than all this? (Yes,) for the Godfearing there are (such) Gardens with their Lord beneath which streams flow. They will live there forever. There will be (for them) chaste wives, and (above all) they shall enjoy the pleasure of Allah.’ And Allah monitors His servants well."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,16,"(These are the people) who say: ‘O our Lord, we have surely believed, so, forgive us our sins and save us from the torment of Hell.’"
The Family of 'Imrân,3,17,"(They are) steadfast (people), truthful in their words and deeds and submissive in devotion and obedience. And they spend in the way of Allah, and (rise) in the later hours of the night to implore Allah’s pardon."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,18,"Allah bears witness that none is worthy of worship apart from Him; and the angels and those who possess knowledge also bear testimony to it (as well as the fact) that He designs and executes every plan with justice. None is worthy of worship but He. He is Almighty, All-Wise."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,19,"Truly, Islam is the only Din (Religion) in Allah’s sight. And the People of the Book disagreed, after knowledge had come to them, only on account of their mutual jealousy and contention. And he who denies Allah’s revelations, then surely Allah hastens in calling to account."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,20,"(O Beloved!) If they, even then, dispute with you, say to them: ‘I have bowed my humble face in absolute submissiveness before the presence of Allah and so have those who follow me.’ And say to the People of the Book as well as the illiterate ones: ‘Do you also bow before Allah absolutely (i.e., do you accept Islam)?’ And, if they embrace submission, then they have truly achieved guidance. But if they turn away, your responsibility is only to deliver the command. And Allah is Watchful of His servants."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,21,"Certainly, those who deny the Revelations of Allah and kill the Prophets unjustly, and also kill those of the people who enjoin equity and justice, announce to them the news of a grievous torment."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,22,They are the ones whose works have become void both in this world and in the Hereafter. And they shall have no helpers.
The Family of 'Imrân,3,23,"Have you not seen those who were given a portion of (the knowledge of) the Book? They are invited towards the Book of Allah, so that it (the Book) gives judgment (on disputes) amongst them. Then, a party of them turn away and it is they who deviate."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,24,This (courage to deviate) is because they say: ‘The Fire of Hell will not touch us except for a few numbered days.’ And the lies that they invent (about Allah) have deluded them with regard to their din (religion).
The Family of 'Imrân,3,25,"So, what will be their plight when We shall assemble all of them together on the Day in (the happening of) which there is no doubt, and everyone will be paid back in full for whatever (deeds) he has earned, and no injustice will be done to them?"
The Family of 'Imrân,3,26,"(O My Beloved!) Submit (like this): ‘O Allah, Lord of sovereignty! You bestow sovereignty on whom You will, and You take away sovereignty from whom You will. You confer honour on whom You will, and You dishonour whom You will. All good is in Your Mighty Hand. Surely, You have absolute authority and control over everything."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,27,"You make the night enter into the day, and You make the day enter into the night; and You bring the living out of the dead, and You bring the dead out of the living; and You bless (with Your bounties) without measure whom You wish.’"
The Family of 'Imrân,3,28,"The Muslims should not make friends with disbelievers instead of Muslims. And whoever does so will have nothing of (the alliance with) Allah except that you seek protection (from their mischief). And Allah warns you to fear (the wrath) of His divine essence, and to Allah is the return."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,29,"Say: ‘Whether you hide what is in your breasts or make it known, Allah knows it, and He thoroughly knows what is in the heavens and what is in the earth. And Allah has mighty control over everything.’"
The Family of 'Imrân,3,30,"On the Day when every soul shall find present (before him) every good that he accomplished and every evil that he perpetrated, he will wish there were a great distance between him and that evil (or that Day). Allah warns you to fear (the wrath) of His divine essence, and Allah is Most Compassionate towards His servants."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,31,"(O Beloved!) Say: ‘If you love Allah, follow me. Allah will then take you as (His) beloved, and forgive you your sins for you, and Allah is Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful.’"
The Family of 'Imrân,3,32,"Say: ‘Obey Allah and the Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him).’ But if they turn away, then Allah does not like the disbelievers."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,33,"Verily, Allah chose Adam, and Nuh (Noah), and the family of Ibrahim (Abraham) and the family of ‘Imran (in dignity) above all the people of the world."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,34,"They are all one race, descendants of one another. And Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,35,"And (recall) when the wife of ‘Imran said: ‘O my Lord, I vow purely to You what is in my womb, freeing him (from other obligations). So, accept (this offering) from me. You are indeed All-Hearing, All-Knowing.’"
The Family of 'Imrân,3,36,"So when she delivered a baby girl, she submitted: ‘Lord, I have given birth but to a female child.’ But Allah knew best what she had given birth to. (She said:) ‘And the boy (that I prayed for) could never (be) like the girl (that Allah has blessed me with); and I have named her Maryam (Mary, the worshipper); and, surely, I commit her and her children to Your protection against (the mischief of) Satan, the outcast.’"
The Family of 'Imrân,3,37,"So, her Lord graciously accepted her (Maryam [Mary]) with excellent acceptance and brought her up immaculately and entrusted her guardianship to Zakariyya (Zacharias). Every time Zakariyya (Zacharias) entered her chamber of worship, he found with her (novel and uncommon) food items. He inquired: ‘O Maryam, wherefrom have these things come for you?’ She replied: ‘This (sustenance) comes from Allah. Verily, Allah provides sustenance without measure to whom He wills.’"
The Family of 'Imrân,3,38,"At the same place, Zakariyya (Zacharias) supplicated his Lord. He submitted: ‘O my Lord, bless me, out of Your Grace, with a virtuous and pure offspring. Surely, You alone hear the supplication.’"
The Family of 'Imrân,3,39,"Whilst he was still standing in the chamber offering the Prayer (or supplicating), the angels called out to him: ‘Indeed, Allah gives you the good news of (a son) Yahya (John), who shall confirm Allah’s Word (i.e., ‘Isa [Jesus]), and he will be a leader, well-protected against (temptation for) women, and a Prophet from amongst (Our) exceptionally pious servants.’"
The Family of 'Imrân,3,40,"(Zakariyya [Zacharias]) submitted: ‘O my Lord, how shall I have a son when old age has already overtaken me, and my wife is (also) barren?’ He said: ‘The same way as Allah does whatever He wills.’"
The Family of 'Imrân,3,41,"Zakariyya (Zacharias) submitted: ‘O my Lord, fix a sign for me.’ Allah said: ‘The sign for you is that for three days you will not be able to communicate to the people except by gestures. And remember your Lord abundantly and glorify Him persistently, evening and morning.’"
The Family of 'Imrân,3,42,"And (remember) when the angels said: ‘O Maryam (Mary), surely Allah has chosen you and has blessed you with purity and has exalted you today over all the women of the world."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,43,"O Maryam (Mary)! Obey your Lord consistently with utmost humbleness, prostrate yourself, and bow down in worship along with those who bow down.’"
The Family of 'Imrân,3,44,(O Beloved!) These are the tidings of the unseen which We reveal to you. But (at that time) you were not present with them when they were casting their pens (by way of a draw to determine) which of them should take care of Maryam (Mary). Nor were you with them when they were disputing with one another.
The Family of 'Imrân,3,45,"When the angels said: ‘O Maryam (Mary), surely, Allah gives you glad tidings of a (particular) Word from Him named the Messiah, ‘Isa, the son of Maryam (Jesus, the son of Mary), who would be eminent and exalted, (both) in this world and in the Hereafter, and would be of those who are exceptionally intimate servants of Allah blessed with His nearness."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,46,"And he will talk to the people (alike) both in the cradle and in ripe years, and he will be one of the most pious servants (of Allah).’"
The Family of 'Imrân,3,47,"Maryam (Mary) submitted: ‘O my Lord, how shall I have a son when no man has ever touched me?’ He said: ‘Just as Allah creates what He pleases.’ When He decides (to do) some work, He just gives it the command ‘Be,’ and it becomes."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,48,"And Allah will teach him the Book and the wisdom, the Torah and the Injil ([the Gospel] everything)."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,49,"And he will be a Messenger to the Children of Israel, (saying to them:) ‘I have undoubtedly brought to you a sign from your Lord: I design for you from clay (a figure) like the shape of a bird; then I breathe into it; and at once it becomes a flying bird by Allah’s command. And I restore health to the born blind, and the lepers, and raise the dead to life by the command of Allah. And I inform you of (all) what you have eaten, and what you have hoarded in your houses. Truly, there is a sign in it for you if you believe."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,50,"And I validate the (Book) Torah sent down before me, and that is because I may declare certain things lawful for you which were forbidden to you as unlawful. And I have come to you from your Lord with a sign. So, fear Allah and obey me."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,51,"Verily, Allah is my Lord and your Lord too. So worship Him alone. This is the straight path.’"
The Family of 'Imrân,3,52,"Later, when ‘Isa (Jesus) sensed their disbelief, he said: ‘Who are my helpers in the way of Allah?’ His sincere companions submitted: ‘We are the helpers of (the Din [Religion] of) Allah. We have believed in Allah and bear witness that we are surely Muslims."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,53,"O our Lord! We have believed in the Book which You have sent down, and we have become the followers of this Messenger. So register us amongst those who bear witness (to the truth).’"
The Family of 'Imrân,3,54,"Then, the disbelieving (Jews) conspired secretly (to execute ‘Isa [Jesus]), but Allah covertly designed His plan (to safeguard ‘Isa [Jesus]). And Allah is the Best of secret planners."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,55,"When Allah said: ‘O ‘Isa (Jesus), I will surely bring your term of life to completion; and I am about to lift you towards Myself (in the heavens), and deliver you from the disbelievers, and exalt your followers above (these) disbelievers till the Day of Resurrection. Then to Me you all have to return. So I shall judge between you in the matters about which you used to dispute.’"
The Family of 'Imrân,3,56,"As for those who disbelieved, I shall give them severe punishment (both) in this world and in the Hereafter, and they shall have no helpers."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,57,"And those who believed and did pious deeds, (Allah) shall reward them in full. And Allah does not like the wrongdoers."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,58,These which We read out to you are signs and the wisdom-laden advice.
The Family of 'Imrân,3,59,"Surely, the example of ‘Isa (Jesus) in the sight of Allah is the same as that of Adam whom He formed from clay, then said (to him): ‘Be.’ And he became."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,60,"(Ordained to forewarn the Umma [the Community]:) ‘This is the truth from your Lord, so be not of those who doubt.’"
The Family of 'Imrân,3,61,"So, if someone contends with you about ‘Isa (Jesus) after knowledge has come to you, say: ‘Come, let us (jointly) call our sons and your sons, our women and your women, and ourselves and yourselves (at the same place). Then let us supplicate fervently (i.e., most submissively) and invoke the curse of Allah upon the liars.’"
The Family of 'Imrân,3,62,"Most certainly, this is the true narrative, and there is none worthy of worship except Allah. And verily Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,63,"But if they turn away, then surely Allah knows the miscreants full well."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,64,"Say: ‘O People of the Book, come to that matter which is common between us and you (namely that): we shall worship none other than Allah, and we shall not associate any partner with Him. Nor shall anyone of us take one another as Lords apart from Allah. Then if they turn away, say: Bear witness that we are but Allah’s obedient servants (Muslims).’"
The Family of 'Imrân,3,65,"O People of the Book! Why do you dispute about Ibrahim ([Abraham] i.e., why do you regard him as a Jew or a Christian])? The truth is that the Torah and the Injil ([the Gospel] on which both your religions are based) were sent down after his time. Have you not even (this much) sense?"
The Family of 'Imrân,3,66,Listen! You are the people who have also been disputing about matters of which you had (but some) knowledge. But why do you dispute about things of which you have no knowledge (at all)? And Allah knows but you do not know.
The Family of 'Imrân,3,67,"Ibrahim (Abraham) was neither a Jew nor a Christian; he was a (true) Muslim, far detached from all heresy and falsehood. Nor was he one of the polytheists."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,68,"Certainly, the nearest of the people to Ibrahim (Abraham), (and the most deserving) are those who have followed him (in his Din [Religion]). And (they) are no other than this Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) and those who have believed (in him). And Allah is the Helper of the believers."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,69,"(O Muslims!) A section of the People of the Book (intensely) desire to, somehow, lead you astray, but they have led astray only themselves whilst they have no sense (of it)."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,70,"O People of the Book! Why are you denying Allah’s Revelations whilst you bear witness yourselves (i.e., you have read everything in your Books)?"
The Family of 'Imrân,3,71,"O People of the Book! Why do you confound the truth with falsehood, and why do you hide the truth whereas you know?"
The Family of 'Imrân,3,72,"And a section of the People of the Book say (to the people): ‘Believe in the Book (Qur’an) which is sent down to Muslims in the morning, and deny it in the evening, so that (imitating you) they may also desert and turn about."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,73,"And do not believe anyone but him who follows (only) your din (religion).’ Say: ‘Surely, the guidance is but the guidance of Allah (alone).’ (And they further say to their people never to believe even this) that: ‘The like of the Book (or din [religion]) given to you may also be given to anyone else, or that someone may give a plea against you before your Lord.’ Say: ‘Bounty is in the Hand of Allah; He bestows on whom He pleases and Allah is All-Embracing, All-Knowing."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,74,He specifies His mercy for whom He wills and Allah is the Lord of Infinite Bounty.’
The Family of 'Imrân,3,75,"And amongst the People of the Book there are a type that if you trust him with a heap of wealth, he will return it to you. And some amongst them are such that if you trust him with one dinar (a gold coin), he will not return it to you unless you keep standing over him. That is because they say: ‘There is no blame on us in the matter of the illiterate.’ And they fabricate a lie against Allah and they know it themselves (as well)."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,76,"Yes, he who fulfils his promise and adopts Godfearingness (will indeed face no accountability); so Allah surely loves the pious."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,77,"Certainly, those who sell the promise of Allah and their own oaths for a small price, it is they who will not have any share in the Hereafter. And on the Day of Resurrection Allah will neither speak to nor look at them, nor will He purify them, and for them will be painful torment."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,78,"And there is indeed another section of them who, whilst reciting the Book, twist their tongues so that you may take their inverted expression as (part of) the Book, whereas it is not from the Book. And they say: ‘It is (all) from Allah,’ while it is not (at all) from Allah. They invent a lie against Allah and they know (it) themselves as well."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,79,No human being whom Allah blesses with the Book and Wisdom and Prophethood has the right to say to the people: ‘Be my servants instead of Allah’s.’ (He would rather say:) ‘Be the devotees of Allah because you teach the Book and because you study it yourselves as well.’
The Family of 'Imrân,3,80,Nor would that Messenger ever command you to take the angels and the Prophets as Lords. Would he command you (now) to disbelieve after you have become Muslims?
The Family of 'Imrân,3,81,"And, (O Beloved, recall) when Allah took a firm covenant from the Prophets: ‘When I give you the Book and Wisdom, and then there comes to you the Messenger (who is exalted in glory above all and) who shall validate the Books you will have with you, you shall then, most certainly, believe in him and most surely help him.’ Allah said: ‘Do you affirm, and on this (condition) hold fast to My heavy covenant?’ All submitted: ‘We affirm.’ Allah said: ‘Bear witness then, and I am also with you amongst the witnesses.’"
The Family of 'Imrân,3,82,"(Now admonished all mankind:) ‘Then he who turns away after this (affirmation), it is they who will be the disobedient.’"
The Family of 'Imrân,3,83,"Do they seek some din (religion) other than Allah’s? And whoever is in the heavens and the earth has embraced His obedience (whether) by choice or by constraint, and to Him shall they all be returned."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,84,"Say: ‘We believe in Allah and in that which has been sent down to us and in that which has been revealed to Ibrahim (Abraham), Isma‘il (Ishmael), Ishaq (Isaac) and Ya‘qub (Jacob) and their descendants and that which has been given to Musa (Moses), ‘Isa (Jesus) and all other Messengers by their Lord (we believe in all). We do not make distinction in our faith in any of them, and to Him we submit ourselves.’"
The Family of 'Imrân,3,85,"And whoever seeks a din (religion) other than Islam that shall not at all be accepted from him, and he will be amongst the losers in the Hereafter."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,86,"How shall Allah guide those who disbelieved after embracing faith whilst they had borne witness that this Messenger is true, and clear signs too had come to them? And Allah does not guide the wrongdoers."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,87,"The punishment of such people is that they are continually plagued by the curse of Allah, of the angels and of all mankind."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,88,"They shall remain (imprisoned) under this curse forever. And neither will this torment be lessened, nor will they be given respite,"
The Family of 'Imrân,3,89,"Except those who repent and mend (their) ways. Allah is, indeed, Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,90,"Assuredly, the people who disbelieve after accepting belief and then advance in disbelief, their repentance will not be accepted at all, and it is they who have lost the right path."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,91,"Surely, those who disbelieved and died whilst they were disbelievers, if any of them offers an earthful of gold as ransom (for his salvation), that shall not be accepted from him at all. It is they for whom there is painful torment. And no helper will be possible for them."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,92,You can never attain to piety unless you spend (in the cause of Allah) out of that which you like the most; and Allah surely knows well whatever you give away.
The Family of 'Imrân,3,93,"Before the revelation of the Torah, everything edible was lawful for the Children of Israel except those (things) Ya‘qub (Jacob) had declared forbidden for himself. Say: ‘Bring the Torah and read it out if you are truthful.’"
The Family of 'Imrân,3,94,"So, whoever fabricates a lie against Allah even after this, then it is they who are the wrongdoers."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,95,"Say: ‘Allah has proclaimed the truth, so follow the Din (Religion) of Ibrahim (Abraham) who, rejecting every evil, devoted himself wholly to Allah. And he was not one of the polytheists.’"
The Family of 'Imrân,3,96,"The first House ever constructed for mankind (to worship Allah) is indeed the one in Mecca, teeming with blessings and (the centre of) guidance for the whole world."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,97,"There are manifest signs in it, (one of which is) the station of Ibrahim (Abraham). Whoever enters it attains safety and protection; and the Pilgrimage to this House is prescribed for the people for the sake of Allah whoever may afford its journey; and whoever denies (it), then indeed Allah is Self-Sufficient, Beyond Need of all the worlds."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,98,"Say: ‘O People of the Book, why do you deny the Revelations of Allah? And Allah is observing your actions.’"
The Family of 'Imrân,3,99,"Say: ‘O People of the Book, why do you hinder the one who has embraced faith from Allah’s path? You want to make their path crooked too, whilst you yourselves are witnesses (that it is straight). And Allah is not unaware of your doings.’"
The Family of 'Imrân,3,100,"O believers! If you obey any section of the People of the Book, they will turn you back to disbelief after you have (embraced) faith."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,101,"And how will you disbelieve (now), whilst you are (fortunate) ones to whom the Verses of Allah are recited, and the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace be upon him) is (himself) present amongst you? And whoever holds fast to (the Embrace of) Allah is most surely guided to the straight path."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,102,O believers! Fear Allah as it is due to fear Him. And death should approach you only in a state when you are Muslims.
The Family of 'Imrân,3,103,"And hold fast to the rope of Allah, all of you together, and do not generate dissension and factions. But call to mind the blessing of Allah upon you when you were enemies (one to another). Then He created the bond of love amongst your hearts, and by His blessing you became brothers. And you (had reached) the brink of a pit of the Fire (of Hell) but He rescued you from it. That is how Allah elaborates His signs to you that you may take guidance to the right path."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,104,"And from amongst you there must be a community comprising the people who invite mankind towards piety, enjoin righteousness and forbid evil. And they are the successful people."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,105,"And become not like those who split into sects and dissented even after manifest signs had reached them. And it is they who will suffer grievous torment,"
The Family of 'Imrân,3,106,"On the Day when many faces will be bright and many others will be dark, the ones with dark faces (will be asked): ‘Did you reject faith after you had believed? So taste the torment for the disbelief you had been committing.’"
The Family of 'Imrân,3,107,But those with (glittering) white faces will be in Allah’s mercy. Therein will they live forever.
The Family of 'Imrân,3,108,These are the Revelations of Allah which We recite to you with truth. And Allah intends no injustice to mankind.
The Family of 'Imrân,3,109,And whatever exists in the heavens and the earth belongs to Allah alone. And to Allah will all matters be returned.
The Family of 'Imrân,3,110,"You are the best community brought forth for (the guidance of) mankind: you enjoin righteousness, forbid evil and believe in Allah. Had the People of the Book also embraced faith, that would certainly have been in their favour. There are some amongst them who believe, whilst the majority of them are disobedient."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,111,"They cannot do you any harm beyond offending; and if they fight you, they will turn their backs upon you; then they will not be helped (as well)."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,112,"They are shut in humiliation wherever they may be found, except that they are (provided with shelter) under some promise with Allah or some bond with people. And they have earned Allah’s wrath, and have been subjected to indigence consequent on their rejection of Allah’s revelations and killing the Prophets unjustly, because they turned into rebels and exceeded all limits (in defiance)."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,113,"They are not all alike. Some of the People of the Book are (also) firmly committed to the truth. They recite the Verses of Allah during the hours of night, and remain in the state of prostration before their Lord."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,114,"They believe in Allah and the Last Day and enjoin righteousness, and forbid evil, and they race to pious works. And it is they who are amongst the pious."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,115,And whatever pious acts they do will not be disregarded; and Allah is Well Aware of those who guard against evil.
The Family of 'Imrân,3,116,"Certainly, those who have disbelieved, neither their riches nor their children will provide them any protection against (the torment of) Allah. And they are the ones who are the inmates of Hell and will live there forever."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,117,"(Whatever) wealth (these people) spend in the life of this world is like the frost-laden wind which strikes and destroys the harvest of a people who wrong their own souls. And Allah has not done them any wrong, but they have wronged their own selves."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,118,"O believers! Do not confide in those who are not from amongst you. They will never miss (any) chance to cause you mischief. They wish you severe torture. As for their malice, that has become evident from their utterances, and (the hostility) that they have concealed in their hearts is (even) greater. We have made the signs manifest to you if you would use your intellect."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,119,"Beware! You are the ones who love them, but they do not (even) like you, although you believe in all the Books. When they meet you, they say: ‘We have accepted faith,’ but when alone, they bite their fingers in rage against you. Say: ‘Perish in your pent-up rage.’ Certainly, Allah knows well the secrets of hearts."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,120,"If something goes in your favour, it grieves them; but if some pain afflicts you, that pleases them. However, if you keep patience and guard yourselves against evil persistently, their deceitfulness will do you no harm. And indeed Allah has encompassed all that they are doing."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,121,"And (recall the time) when, early morning, you left your blessed abode (on the eve of the battle of Uhud), and were positioning the Muslims at their posts for the battle (in defence against the aggression by Meccan invaders). And Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,122,(Recall) when two groups from amongst you (Banu Salama Khazraj and Banu Haritha Aws) intended cowardliness although Allah was their ally. And the believers must have trust in Allah alone.
The Family of 'Imrân,3,123,"And Allah provided you help in the battle of Badr, whereas you had little resources (at that time). Therefore, fear Allah so that you may become grateful."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,124,When you said to the believers: ‘Is it not enough for you that your Lord should reinforce you with three thousand angels sent-down?’
The Family of 'Imrân,3,125,"Yes, if you remain steadfast and persist in Godwariness, and these (unbelievers) suddenly attack you with (full) force, then your Lord will come to your aid with five thousand angels distinctly marked."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,126,"And Allah has made this (reinforcement) a glad tidings for you so that it may content your hearts. And support comes only from Allah, Who is Almighty, Most Wise,"
The Family of 'Imrân,3,127,(Also) because (Allah) may exterminate a section of the unbelievers or abase them so that they go back defeated.
The Family of 'Imrân,3,128,"(O Beloved! Now) this matter is not your concern, whether Allah enables them to repent or torments them, because they are the transgressors."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,129,"Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth belongs to Allah alone. He forgives whom He wills and punishes whom He wills and Allah is Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,130,"O believers! Do not live on usury doubled and redoubled, and keep fearing Allah so that you may prosper."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,131,"And fear the Fire, which has been prepared for those who reject faith."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,132,And persist in obedience to Allah and the Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) so that you may be blessed with mercy.
The Family of 'Imrân,3,133,And advance fast towards forgiveness from your Lord and Paradise whose vastness encompasses the heavens and the earth (and) which has been prepared for the pious.
The Family of 'Imrân,3,134,"They are the ones who spend in the cause of Allah whether they are affluent or indigent (in both the conditions), sublimate their anger and tolerate (the faults of the) people; and Allah loves those who are benevolent."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,135,"And (they) are such people that if they commit some immoral act or wrong themselves, they remember Allah, then seek forgiveness for their sins. And who forgives sins except Allah? And they do not deliberately persist in the sinful acts which they committed."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,136,It is they whose reward is forgiveness from their Lord and Gardens beneath which rivers flow. They will reside therein permanently. What an excellent reward that is for those who perform righteous acts!
The Family of 'Imrân,3,137,Before you many codes (of divine law) have passed (for the preceding nations). So travel in the earth and observe what was the end of those who belied!
The Family of 'Imrân,3,138,This Qur’an is an exposition for mankind and guidance and counsel for those who fear Allah.
The Family of 'Imrân,3,139,"And do not lose heart or feel grieved; and it is you who will be victorious, provided you maintain (perfect) faith."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,140,"If you have received a blow (now, then remember that) they too have received a similar blow already. These are the days which We rotate amongst people. And these (ups and downs) occur so that Allah may distinguish the identity of true believers and bestow upon some of you the status of martyrs. And Allah does not like the wrongdoers."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,141,"And this is (also) with the intention that Allah may bring (more) refinement to the believers (i.e., cleanse and purify them) and annihilate the disbelievers."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,142,"Do you assume that you will enter Paradise (without any good), whereas Allah has not yet tested those of you who fight for His cause, nor has He judged the steadfast?"
The Family of 'Imrân,3,143,And you used to long for death (as a martyr) before you faced it. So now you have seen it in front of your own eyes.
The Family of 'Imrân,3,144,"And Muhammad (blessings and peace be upon him) is but a Messenger (and not God). Many Messengers have passed away (from this world) before him as well. So, if he passes away or is martyred, will you then turn on your heels (back to your former religion i.e., will you consider his death or martyrdom—God forbid!—a proof that the Din [Religion] of Islam or his Messengership is false)? And whoever turns back on his heels shall not harm Allah the least. And Allah will soon reward those who give thanks (by remaining steadfast in hardship)."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,145,"And no one can die without Allah’s command. (His) term has been fixed in writing. And whoever desires the reward of this world, We give him of that; and whoever longs for the reward of the Hereafter, We give him of that; and soon shall We pay reward (affluently) to those who pay thanks."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,146,And how many Prophets have there been who fought in the cause of Allah! A large number of devotees of Allah (Awliya’) also joined them. They did not lose heart due to hardships which afflicted them in the way of Allah and neither showed weakness nor gave in. And Allah loves those who remain steadfast.
The Family of 'Imrân,3,147,"And they said nothing except this supplication: ‘O our Lord, forgive our sins and overlook the excesses that we committed in our work, and keep us firm-footed (on Your path), and bestow upon us victory over the disbelievers.’"
The Family of 'Imrân,3,148,"So, Allah paid them the reward of this world and also an excellent recompense in the Hereafter. And Allah loves (those) righteous people (who love Him alone)."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,149,"O believers! If you obey the disbelievers, they will turn you back on your heels (to disbelief) and you will then turn back as losers."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,150,"Nay, Allah is your Mawla (Helper and Guardian) and He is the best of helpers."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,151,"Soon shall We plant (your) awesomeness into the hearts of disbelievers because they have associated with Allah partners for which He has not sent down any authority. And Hell is their abode, and extremely horrible is (that) abode of the wrongdoers."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,152,"Surely, Allah fulfilled His promise to you when you were killing them by His command until you showed cowardice and you started disputing about the command (of the Messenger [blessings and peace be upon him]) and later disobeyed (him), whereas Allah had brought that victory in your sight which you coveted. Amongst you were some who desired the gains of this world, and some others who sought reward in the Hereafter. Then He turned you back from them (dominated) so that He tests you. (Later, however,) He pardoned you and Allah is Most Gracious to the believers."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,153,"When you were running away (in panic) and did not look back at anyone, and the Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) was calling you out (standing) amongst the party that were (steadfast) in your rear. Then He inflicted upon you sorrows one after the other (for admonition and training) so that you might not grieve over what you had lost and the calamity that had befallen you. And Allah is Well Aware of your works."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,154,"Then after grief He sent down on you calm (and peace for relief) in the form of a slumber that overtook a party of you, whilst another party (comprising hypocrites who) were only worried about their own souls indulged in false assumptions about Allah which were (just) the assumptions of ignorance. They say: ‘Do we too have anything (i.e., authority) in this matter?’ Say: ‘The whole matter is in the Hand of Allah.’ They have concealed in their hearts things which they let not be disclosed to you. They say: ‘Had we any say in this matter, we would not have been slain here.’ Say: ‘Even if you had been in your homes, those for whom killing was decreed would have come over to their slaughter places. And that has been (done) so that Allah may test what is in your breasts, and purge exhaustively (the apprehensions) pent up in your hearts. And Allah has thorough knowledge of the secrets of breasts."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,155,"Certainly, those of you who fled on that day when the two armies engaged in fierce fighting were only caused by Satan to slip, owing to some act they had perpetrated. Allah pardoned them indeed. He is, of course, Most Forgiving, Most Forbearing."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,156,"O believers! Be not like the infidels who say of those of their brothers who go (somewhere) on a journey or go to fight (and die there): ‘Had they stayed with us, they would have neither died nor been slain,’ so that Allah may make this (assumption) a regret in their hearts. Allah alone keeps alive and causes death. And Allah is All-Seer of what you do."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,157,"And if you are slain in the cause of Allah or die, Allah’s forgiveness and mercy is far better than that (wealth) which you accumulate."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,158,"And if you die or are slain, you will (all) be brought together before Allah."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,159,"(O My Esteemed Beloved!) What a mercy of Allah that you are lenient with them! Had you been stern and hard-hearted, people would have deserted, scattering away from around you. So pardon them, and pray for their forgiveness, and consult them in (important) matters. But once you make up your mind, then place your trust in Allah. Surely, Allah loves those who trust Him."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,160,"If Allah helps you, none can overpower you; but if He abandons you taking away all support, then who is it that can help you after Him? And the believers should rely on Allah alone."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,161,"It is just not conceivable that any Prophet would conceal anything. And whoever hides away (another’s right) will have to bring forth on the Day of Resurrection whatever he had held back. Then everyone will be paid in full for his deeds, and they will not be wronged."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,162,"How can a person who has subjected himself to the will of Allah be like the one who has earned Allah’s wrath? And Hell is his abode, and that is an extremely evil dwelling."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,163,They have varying grades in the sight of Allah and Allah thoroughly observes their acts.
The Family of 'Imrân,3,164,"Indeed, Allah conferred a great favour on the believers that He raised amongst them (the most eminent) Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) from amongst themselves, who recites to them His Revelations, purifies them, and educates them on the Book and Wisdom though, before that, they were in manifest error."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,165,"Is it not that when disaster seized you, whilst you had inflicted twice as much (on your enemy), you said: ‘Whence has it befallen’? Say: ‘It is from your own selves.’ Indeed, Allah has absolute control over everything."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,166,"And the agony that hurt you on the day when the two armies clashed with each other came about (only) by Allah’s command. And (this happened) so that Allah establishes the identity of the believers,"
The Family of 'Imrân,3,167,"And (He) also distinguishes the identity of those who are hypocrites. And when it was said to them: ‘Come and fight in the cause of Allah or defend (against the enemy invasion),’ they said: ‘If we knew that there would be (virtually) a war, (or if we considered it a war in the cause of Allah,) we would certainly follow you.’ That day they were closer to an evident disbelief than (the pretended) belief. They utter from their mouths that which is not in their hearts. And Allah knows well (the matters) they hide."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,168,"(They) are the ones who said about their brothers, whilst they themselves stayed back (home): ‘Had they accepted our counsel, they would not have been slain.’ Say: ‘Protect yourselves from death if you are truthful.’"
The Family of 'Imrân,3,169,"And do not (ever) think that those who are slain in the way of Allah are dead. Rather, they are alive in the presence of their Lord. They are served with sustenance (comprising bounties of Paradise)."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,170,"They rejoice in these (blessings of eternal life) that Allah has conferred on them of His bounty, and they also feel pleased (on finding) their successors (on the path of faith and obedience) who have not (yet) joined them, for they shall also have neither any fear nor any grief."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,171,"They are filled with joy owing to the blessing (of divine disclosures of the nearness) of Allah and His bounty (i.e., the pleasures of meeting with Him), and (also) because Allah does not waste the reward of the believers."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,172,"Those who submitted to the command of Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) even after sustaining injuries—for those of them who possess spiritual excellence and are God-fearing, there is an immense reward."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,173,"They are the ones whom people said: ‘The adversaries have gathered (in great number) against you, so fear them.’ But this (information) further enhanced their faith and they proclaimed: ‘Allah is Sufficient for us and what an excellent Guardian He is!’"
The Family of 'Imrân,3,174,"Then they (the Muslims) returned with the bounties and blessings of Allah, untouched by any suffering. They followed the will of Allah, and Allah is the Lord of great bounty."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,175,"Surely, this (informer) is Satan alone who threatens (you) through his friends. Therefore, do not fear them and fear Me alone, if you are the believers."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,176,"(O sympathizer of the whole mankind!) Those who hasten in (reinforcing) disbelief should not aggrieve you. They cannot do any damage to (the Din [Religion] of) Allah, and Allah intends that there is no share for them in the Hereafter. And for them there is a severe torment."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,177,"Indeed, those who purchase disbelief at the cost of belief cannot harm Allah the least, and for them there is a grievous chastisement."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,178,And the disbelievers must never assume that the respite We are providing them is of any good to their souls. We are granting them (this) respite that they may grow further in sins. And (ultimately) there is for them a humiliating torment.
The Family of 'Imrân,3,179,"And Allah will never leave the Muslims in the situation you are in (now) until He distinguishes the impure from the pure. And, (O common people,) it is not Allah’s Glory that He reveals to you the unseen. However, Allah chooses from amongst His Messengers whom He wills (for the knowledge of the unseen). Therefore, put faith in Allah and His Messengers. And if you embrace faith and become Godfearing, there is a tremendous reward for you."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,180,"And those who are niggardly in giving away (from the wealth) which Allah has bestowed upon them out of His bounty must never consider this miserliness of any benefit to themselves; it is rather injurious to them. Soon on the Day of Resurrection, this wealth they are niggardly about will be put around (their necks) like a neck-fetter. To Allah belongs the heritage of the heavens and the earth (i.e., He will remain the Owner of the universe after your death in the same way as He owns it today). And Allah is well aware of all your deeds."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,181,Allah has surely heard the remarks of those who say: ‘Allah is indigent and we are rich.’ We shall keep a written record of all that they say and their unjust killing of the Prophets (as well). And (on the Day of Resurrection) We shall say: ‘(Now you) taste the incinerating torment.’
The Family of 'Imrân,3,182,"This is the recompense of your deeds that your hands have forwarded ahead, and indeed Allah does not do injustice to servants."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,183,"The people (Jews) who say (as a justification): ‘Allah sent us the command not to put faith in any Messenger unless he (to prove his Messengership) brings us an offering that the fire will devour.’ Say (to them): ‘Certainly, many Messengers with evident signs preceded me and also (came) with the sign which you speak of. Then (despite that) why did you martyr them if you are (so) truthful?’"
The Family of 'Imrân,3,184,"If, even then, they belie you, (My Beloved, do not be aggrieved). So many Messengers who brought clear signs (miracles), scriptures and the enlightening Book were belied before you."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,185,"Every soul is going to taste death. And your full recompense will be paid back only on the Day of Resurrection. So, whoever will be saved from Hell and admitted to Paradise will be truly successful. And the worldly life is nothing but illusory wealth."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,186,"(O believers!) You will most certainly be tested in your possessions and your selves. And of course you shall also hear many torturing (taunts) from those who were given the Book before you and who are polytheists. But if you remain patient and stick to self-protection, that is one of the works demanding high resolve."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,187,"And (remember) when Allah took a firm promise from those who were given the Book: ‘You shall communicate it clearly and plainly to the people and shall not hide (whatever is described in it),’ they cast this promise behind their backs and sold it for a paltry price. This is an extremely evil transaction on their part."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,188,Never regard those (as the emancipated ones) who rejoice over their crooked works and want to be praised for the deeds that they have never done. (Proclaimed for emphasis:) Never think that they are delivered from punishment; and for them is an awful torment.
The Family of 'Imrân,3,189,The sovereignty of all the heavens and the earth belongs to Allah alone and Allah has perfect control over everything. (So focus your attention on and trust in Him alone.)
The Family of 'Imrân,3,190,"Indeed, in the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the alternation of the night and the day, there are signs (of Allah’s absolute authority) for those who possess constructive wisdom."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,191,"These are the people who, remembering Allah, remain standing (as the epitome of submissiveness), sitting (as reverence incarnate), and (also keep) changing sides (in discomfort of love) and meditate on (the manifest lustre of His Eminence and Beauty at work in) the creation of the heavens and the earth. (Then, acquainted with the pleasure of His gnosis, they call out spontaneously:) ‘O our Lord, You have not created (all) this without any rationale and strategy. You are (impeccably) Pure (of all shortcomings and obligations). So protect us from the torment of Hell."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,192,"O our Lord! Indeed, whomever You admit to Hell, You have surely humiliated him, and the wrongdoers do not have any supporters."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,193,"O our Lord! (We were oblivious of You,) then we heard a Caller, calling towards faith: ‘(O people,) believe in your Lord.’ So we embraced faith. O our Lord, now forgive our sins and erase our blunders (from the record of our works) and make us die in the company of the pious."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,194,"O our Lord! Grant us all that You have promised us through Your Messengers, and do not humiliate us on the Day of Resurrection. Surely, You do not go against Your promise.’"
The Family of 'Imrân,3,195,"Then their Lord accorded approval to their supplication (and said:) ‘Certainly, I do not waste the wages of any labourer, whether man or woman; you all are from one another. So those who have emigrated (for the cause of Allah) and have been driven out of their dwellings (for Him alone) and have been offended in My way and fought for My sake and were slain, I shall verily erase their sins from their record of works, and admit them to the Gardens beneath which rivers flow. This is the reward from Allah, and (even) better reward (than this) lies with Allah alone."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,196,(O servant of Allah!) The roaming about of the disbelievers in the cities (with luxurious riches) should not cause you any illusion.
The Family of 'Imrân,3,197,This is an insignificant possession (for a brief period). Then their abode will be Hell and that is a very evil abode.
The Family of 'Imrân,3,198,"But those who persist in fearing their Lord, for them there are Gardens beneath which rivers flow. There they will reside forever. This is hospitality (for them) from Allah. And (His chamber of Proximity, lustre of His Beauty and the Blessing of meeting with Him, in sum,) whatever there is with Allah is excellent for the pious."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,199,"And indeed, some People of the Book are such that they believe in Allah, and also (have faith in) the Book that has been revealed to you, and the one which was sent down to them. Their hearts remain subdued before Allah. And they do not receive a paltry price for the Revelations of Allah. They are the ones whose reward lies with their Lord. Indeed, Allah is Swift at reckoning."
The Family of 'Imrân,3,200,"O believers! Be steadfast and, in perseverance (and tenacity), toil (even harder than the enemy) and be alert and vigilant (for struggle against violation of peace and human rights), and (always) persist in fearing Allah so that you may achieve success."
Women,4,1,"O mankind! Fear your Lord, Who (initiated) your creation from a single soul, then from it created its mate, and from these two spread (the creation of) countless men and women. So, fear Allah for Whose sake you solicit needs from one another. And (become Godfearing) towards your own kith and kin (as well). Allah is indeed Ever-Watchful over you."
Women,4,2,"And deliver to the orphans their belongings; and do not exchange the bad for the good; nor consume their wealth by mixing it with your own. Indeed, this is a great sin."
Women,4,3,"And if you have the apprehension that you will not be able to treat the orphan girls justly, then marry the women you like and who are lawful for you, two or three or four (but this sanction is conditional on justice). But if you fear that you will not be able to treat (more than one wife) justly, then (marry) only one woman or the maids who have come under your possession (according to the Islamic law). This makes it more likely that you restrain yourselves from committing injustice."
Women,4,4,"And pay the women their dower with a pleased heart. Then if they forgo for you some (of the dower) out of their own pleasure, you may consume it as pleasant and favourable (for you)."
Women,4,5,"And do not entrust to the mentally deficient your (or their) assets which Allah has made a means of stability for your economy. However, feed them out of it and clothe them, and say to them good and nice words."
Women,4,6,"And evaluate and test the orphans (for the sake of their training) till they attain to (the age of) marriage. Then if you discern in them ingenuity (and the knack of planning), hand over their assets to them. And devour not their wealth spending it wastefully and in haste (fearing that after) they grow mature (they will take it back). The one who is affluent must absolutely abstain (from the orphan’s property), but he who is indigent (himself) should consume but a fair portion of it (only). And when you return to them their assets, take witnesses over them. And Sufficient is Allah at reckoning."
Women,4,7,"Men have a share in (the assets) that their parents and nearest kin leave behind, and women (also) have a share in the inheritance of their parents and the nearest kin. Be it small or large, the share has been fixed (by Allah)."
Women,4,8,"If the relatives (other than heirs) and the orphans and the indigent are present on the occasion of the division (of inheritance), give them also something out of it and say to them good and nice words."
Women,4,9,"And the people (who execute matters of orphans) should fear that (whilst dying), if they were to leave tender offspring behind, (how) frightened (and worried) they would be over the plight of their children! They should, therefore, keep fearing Allah (in the matter of orphans) and should speak in a straightforward manner."
Women,4,10,"Indeed, those who eat up the property of orphans unjustly fill their bellies but with fire, and soon will they fall into a Blazing Fire."
Women,4,11,"Allah commands you concerning (the inheritance of) your children: The share of a son is equal to that of two daughters; then if there are only daughters (two or) more, they are entitled to two-thirds of the inheritance; if there is only one daughter, her share will be one half; the mother and the father of the deceased will get one-sixth of the inheritance each if the deceased leaves children behind; but in case the deceased has no children and the heirs are only his mother and his father, the mother’s share is one-third (and the rest is the father’s); then, if he has brothers and sisters, the mother will have a sixth portion. This distribution will be (executed) after (the fulfilment of) the will he may have made or after (the payment of) the debt. You know not which of them, whether your parents or your sons, are closer to you in bringing you benefit. This (distribution) is a duty assigned (i.e., fixed) by Allah. Surely, Allah is All-Knowing, Most Wise."
Women,4,12,"And for you, the share in the property your wives leave is one half, provided they have no children. In case they have offspring, then there is one-fourth of inheritance for you, (that too) after (the fulfilment of) the will that may have been made or after (the payment of) debt. And the share of your wives in the assets you leave is one-fourth, provided you have no children. But if you have children, then their share in your inheritance is one-eighth, after (the fulfilment of) the will made pertaining to (the inheritance) or the payment of (your) debt. In the case of a man or a woman who leaves neither parents nor children, but who has a brother or a sister (on the mother’s side i.e., a uterine brother or a sister), there is a one-sixth share for each of the two. But if they are more than that, they all will be sharers in one-third. (This division shall also be accomplished) after the will which is made without any prejudice towards the heirs or after the (payment) of debt. This is a command from Allah, and Allah is All-Knowing, Most Forbearing."
Women,4,13,"These are the limits set by Allah. And the one who obeys Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him), He (Allah) will admit him to the Gardens beneath which rivers flow. They shall reside therein forever, and this is a great achievement."
Women,4,14,"But whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) and exceeds His limits, He will admit him to Hell wherein shall he dwell forever; and there is a humiliating torment for him."
Women,4,15,"And those of your women who commit adultery, call in from your men four witnesses against them. Then if they produce evidence, confine those women to their houses till death completes their term of life, or Allah ordains a way (i.e., a new injunction) for them."
Women,4,16,"And the two persons who commit adultery from amongst you, punish them both. Then, if they repent and mend (their) ways, refrain from punishing them. Indeed, Allah is Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful."
Women,4,17,"Allah has only promised to accept the repentance of those who commit evil deeds due to ignorance and then repent soon after. So Allah will turn to such people with His mercy and Allah is All-Knowing, Most Wise."
Women,4,18,"But repentance is not (accepted) of the people who persist in sinful acts until death overtakes one of them, (then) he says: ‘Now I repent.’ Nor is repentance (of any avail) to those who die as disbelievers. We have prepared grievous torment for them."
Women,4,19,"O believers! It is not lawful for you to become heirs to women by force. And do not retain them by force in order to take (back) from them a portion of what you gave them, unless they commit open indecency. And treat them honourably. Then if you dislike them, it may be that you dislike a thing and Allah places in it abundant good."
Women,4,20,"And if you seek to take a wife in place of another and you have (by now) given to her heaps of wealth, yet do not take back any part of it. Do you want to take that wealth (back) by means of unjust accusation and manifest sin?"
Women,4,21,"And how can you take it back whilst you have had marital relations with each other, and they have (also) taken a firm promise from you?"
Women,4,22,"And do not marry women whom your fathers and forefathers married. But that which has passed (before this command is forgiven). It is indeed highly indecent, infuriating and an evil custom."
Women,4,23,"Forbidden to you are your mothers and your daughters and your sisters and your father’s sisters and your mother’s sisters and your brother’s daughters and sister’s daughters and your mothers (who) have suckled you, your foster sisters and mothers of your wives. And (similarly) your stepdaughters brought up under your parentage born of your women with whom you have had marital relations (are also forbidden to you.) If you have not had martial relations, then there is no harm (in marrying their daughters). Also forbidden are the wives of your real sons who are of your loins, and having (in marriage) two sisters together, except what has passed in the days of ignorance. Allah indeed is Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful."
Women,4,24,"And (forbidden to you are also) women having husbands except those (prisoners of war) who come into your legal possession. Allah has prescribed for you (these prohibitions). And (all women) other than these are made lawful for you, so that you may wish them for marriage by means of your money (i.e., dower), maintaining chastity and not in pursuit of satisfying lust. Then those of them from whom you have received benefit in exchange for that (money), pay them their fixed dowers. And there is no sin on you pertaining to the money on which you mutually agree after fixing the dower. Surely, Allah is All-Knowing, Most Wise."
Women,4,25,"And whoever of you cannot afford to marry free believing women may marry those believing slave girls who are in your possession (under Islamic law). And Allah knows best (the state of) your belief. You (all) are one from another. So, marry these (slave girls) with the permission of their masters, and pay them their dowers according to custom, provided they are wedlocked (being chaste), neither committing illegal sex, nor taking secret lovers. If they commit fornication after they have entered into wedlock, their punishment will be the half of that (appointed) for free (unmarried) women. This permission is for him amongst you who fears (indulging in) sin, and if you practise self-restraint, that is better for you. And Allah is Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful."
Women,4,26,"Allah intends to explain to you (His commands) and guide you to the ways of those (pious) people who have passed before you and turn to you in mercy. And Allah is All-Knowing, Most Wise."
Women,4,27,"And Allah intends to bestow upon you His favour, but those who pursue the lusts (of the ill-commanding selves) wish you to turn far away from the right path."
Women,4,28,Allah intends to lighten your burden. And man has been created weak (and infirm).
Women,4,29,"O believers! Do not devour one another’s wealth unlawfully amongst yourselves unless it is a trade by your mutual agreement and do not kill yourselves. Surely, Allah is Kind to you."
Women,4,30,"But whoever will do that through transgression and injustice, We shall soon throw him into the Fire (of Hell) and that is very easy for Allah."
Women,4,31,"If you keep abstaining from major sins that you are forbidden to do, We shall remove from you your minor sins and shall admit you to a place of honour."
Women,4,32,"And do not long for the thing in which Allah has made some of you superior to others. Men will have a share of what they earn, and women will have a share of what they earn, and keep begging Allah for His bounty. Surely, Allah knows best everything ."
Women,4,33,"And We have appointed to everyone heirs of the property left by parents and near relations. And to those with whom you have made an agreement, give them their share. Assuredly, Allah observes everything."
Women,4,34,"Men are guardians of women, because Allah has made one superior to the other, and (also) because men spend their wealth (on them). So the pious wives are obedient. They guard (their chastity) in the absence of their husbands with the protection of Allah. But those women whom you fear will disobey and defy, admonish them; and (if they do not amend) separate them (from yourselves) in beds; and (if they still do not improve) turn away from them, striking a temporary parting. Then if they become cooperative with you, do not seek any way against them. Surely, Allah is Most High, Most Great."
Women,4,35,"And if you fear a breach between the two, then appoint one arbitrator from the husband’s family and the other from the wife’s family. If both (the arbitrators) resolve to bring about settlement, Allah will create harmony between them. Indeed, Allah is All-Knowing, All-Aware."
Women,4,36,"And worship Allah and do not set up any partners with Him. And treat the parents with moral excellence and (do good to) relatives, orphans, the needy, the close as well as unacquainted neighbours, and your fellows and the wayfarers and those whom you possess. Surely, Allah does not like the one who is arrogant (i.e., self-conceited) and boastful (i.e., egoist),"
Women,4,37,"Those who are miserly and bid others (also) to be miserly and hide that (blessing) which Allah has granted them of His bounty. And We have prepared a disgraceful torment for the disbelievers,"
Women,4,38,"And those who spend their wealth to show off to people, and believe neither in Allah nor in the Last Day. And whoever Satan sides with as a companion, so he is an evil companion!"
Women,4,39,"And what loss would they have suffered, if they had believed in Allah and the Last Day, and spent (in His way) of what Allah had given them? And Allah is Well Aware of them (i.e., their state of affairs)."
Women,4,40,"Surely, Allah does not do (even) an iota of injustice, and if there is a good work, He doubles it and grants from His presence an immense reward."
Women,4,41,"Then how it will be on the Day when We shall bring one witness from each Umma (Community), and, (O Beloved,) We shall bring you as a witness against them all?"
Women,4,42,On that Day those who disbelieved and disobeyed the Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) will wish that (after burying them) the earth over them were levelled. And they will not be able to hide anything from Allah.
Women,4,43,"O believers! Do not go near Prayer in a drunken state until you are able to understand what you say. Nor (should you approach Prayer) until you bathe after total ablution becomes obligatory, unless you are travelling. And if you are sick, or on a journey, or return from a call of nature, or make sexual contact with (your) women and then fail to find water, then clean yourselves by using pure soil. So wipe your faces and hands. Surely, Allah is Most Pardoning, Most Forgiving."
Women,4,44,"Have you not seen those who were given a portion of the (revealed) Book? They buy misguidance, and want you (also) to turn away from the straight path."
Women,4,45,And Allah knows best your enemies and Allah is Sufficient (as) a Protector and Allah is Sufficient (as) a Helper.
Women,4,46,"And some amongst the Jews pervert the words (of the Torah) from their (original) places and say: ‘We have heard but we disobey,’ and (also say): ‘Listen! (God forbid!) May you not be listened to,’ and twisting their tongues, scoffing at Din (Religion) they say: ‘Ra‘ina.’ And, (instead,) if they had said: ‘We have heard and obeyed,’ and ‘(Your Eminence! Please) give audience (to our request), and bless us with a (benevolent and kind) look,’ that would have been better for them, and (this utterance) would have been right and appropriate (too); but Allah has cursed them owing to their disbelief. So they do not believe except a few."
Women,4,47,"O People of the Book! Believe in (that Book) which We have revealed (now to Our Beloved Muhammad [blessings and peace be upon him]) which (originally) confirms the Book that is with you, before We disfigure (features of some) faces and turn them on to their rear, or cast on them a curse like the one that We cast on those (who disobeyed) in the case of Sabbath. And the commandment of Allah is bound to be executed."
Women,4,48,"Surely, Allah does not forgive setting up of partners with Him, and He forgives (any other sin) lesser in degree for whom He wills. And whoever sets up partners with Allah certainly fabricates a horrible sin."
Women,4,49,"Have you not seen the people who show themselves off as pure? Nay, Allah is the One Who purifies whom He pleases, and they will not be wronged even equal to a thread."
Women,4,50,"Look! How they invent a lie against Allah, and this manifest sin is sufficient (for afflicting them with torment)!"
Women,4,51,Have you not seen those who have been given a portion of (the revealed) Book? (In spite of that) they believe in idols and Satan. And about the disbelievers they say: ‘These (disbelievers) are better guided than the believers.’
Women,4,52,"These are the people whom Allah has cursed, and you will not find any helper at all for the one whom Allah curses."
Women,4,53,"Have they any share in the kingdom? If so, they would not give (anything) to the people worth even a speck (because of their miserliness)."
Women,4,54,"Do they (the Jews) feel jealous of the people because of (the blessings) which Allah has conferred upon them of His bounty? So, surely, We have given the family of Ibrahim (Abraham) the Book and wisdom, and We also granted them a great kingdom."
Women,4,55,"So, some of them believed in it and some turned away from it, and enough is the blazing Fire of Hell (for those who turn away)."
Women,4,56,"Surely, those who disbelieved in Our Revelations, We shall soon hurl them into the Fire (of Hell). When their skins are burnt off, We shall replace them with other skins so that they may taste the torment (continually). Surely, Allah is Almighty, Most Wise."
Women,4,57,"Those who believe and assiduously perform pious acts, We shall admit them to Gardens beneath which streams flow. They will live there forever. Therein will be pure spouses for them. And We shall admit them into plenteous, deep shades."
Women,4,58,"Surely, Allah commands you to entrust the belongings to those who are worthy of them; and when you judge matters amongst people, give judgment with justice. What an excellent advice Allah gives you! Surely, Allah is All-Hearing, All-Seeing."
Women,4,59,"O believers! Obey Allah and obey the Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) and those (men of truth) who hold command amongst you. Then if you disagree amongst yourselves over any issue, refer it to Allah and the Messenger ([blessings and peace be upon him] for final judgment), if you believe in Allah and the Last Day. That is best (for you) and best for the end result."
Women,4,60,"Have you not seen these (hypocrites) who claim (verbally) that they believe in this (Book, the Qur’an) which has been revealed to you and also in those (revealed Books) which were sent down before you? (But) they desire to take their disputes (for settlement) to Satan (i.e., the law based on defiance against Allah’s commandments) although they have been ordained to reject it (openly). And Satan only desires to lead them far astray."
Women,4,61,"And when they are asked to come to what Allah has revealed (the Qur’an) and to the Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him), you will see that the hypocrites turn away from (coming towards) you."
Women,4,62,"Then what will be their plight (at that time) when some disaster befalls them on account of their own crooked works, and they will appear before you swearing by Allah, (saying): ‘We intended nothing but piety and mutual harmony’?"
Women,4,63,"These are the (hypocrite and vicious) people whose every secret in their hearts Allah knows best. So, avoid them and admonish them persistently, and establish effective communication with them about themselves."
Women,4,64,"And We have not sent any Messenger but that he must be obeyed by the command of Allah. And, (O Beloved,) if they, having wronged their souls, had come to you imploring the forgiveness of Allah, and the Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) had also asked forgiveness for them, then (owing to this mediation and intercession) they would certainly have found Allah Most Relenting, Ever-Merciful."
Women,4,65,"So, (O Beloved,) by your Lord, they cannot become true believers until they make you a judge in every dispute that arises amongst them, and thereafter they do not feel any resentment in their hearts against the judgment that you make, and submit (to your decision) gladly, with total submission."
Women,4,66,"If We had prescribed for them: ‘Kill yourselves, or leave your homes and go away,’ only a few of them would have acted upon it. If they had abided by what they were advised to do, that would have been in their favour, enabling them to tenaciously hold fast (to the Faith)."
Women,4,67,And then We too would have bestowed upon them a great reward from Our presence.
Women,4,68,And We would have surely guided them to the straight path.
Women,4,69,"And whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) are the people who will be in the company of those (spiritual dignitaries on the Last Day) whom Allah has blessed with His (special) favour: the Prophets, the truthful, the martyrs and the most pious. And how excellent these companions are!"
Women,4,70,"This (exceptional) bounty is from Allah, and Allah suffices as a Knower."
Women,4,71,"O believers! Fit out for your safeguard, then set out as separate units or march off all together."
Women,4,72,"And certainly there are some amongst you who delay (slackening intentionally). Then if (during war) some adversity befalls you, he (who tarries behind) says: ‘Indeed, Allah has favoured me in that I was not present with them (in the battlefield).’"
Women,4,73,"But if some favour comes to you from Allah, (then) the same (hypocrite) shall (regretfully) say, as if there was no friendship between you and him: ‘Would that I had been with them, then I would also have achieved a massive triumph!’"
Women,4,74,"So they (the believers) who sell the life of this world for the Hereafter should fight in the cause of Allah (for the establishment of peace and elimination of terrorism). And whoever fights in the way of Allah, whether he (himself) gets slain or wins victory, (in both cases) We shall soon bless him with great reward."
Women,4,75,"What has happened to you (Muslims) that you do not fight in the cause of Allah (for the freedom of the oppressed), whereas those helpless (oppressed and tyrannized) men, women and children who (depressed by the plunder and carnage) call out (for their freedom): ‘O our Lord! Rescue us from this town whose (affluent and influential) people are oppressors, and appoint for us some guardian from Your presence, and make someone our helper from Your presence’?"
Women,4,76,"Those who believe fight in the way of Allah (for the restoration of peace and elimination of oppression and exploitation), and those who disbelieve fight in the way of Satan (for evil and mischievous objectives). So, (O believers,) fight against Satan’s allies (the enemies of humankind). Surely, Satan’s maneuvering is ineffective."
Women,4,77,"Have you not observed the state of those who were instructed: ‘Restrain your hands (even from defensive fighting), and establish Prayer and pay Zakat (the Alms-due) regularly’? (So they were happy with it.) But when the armed struggle (against tyranny and aggression) was prescribed for them, a section of them started fearing (hostile) people the way one fears Allah or even more. And they said: ‘O our Lord! Why have You enjoined fighting upon us (so soon)? Why have You not given us respite for another short period?’ Say (to them): ‘Worldly interest is minor (i.e., immaterial) whilst the Hereafter is an extremely valuable (blessing) for the one who becomes Godwary and pious. There, you shall not be treated unjustly even equal to a thread.’"
Women,4,78,"(O you who abstain from the armed struggle due to fear of death!) Death will overtake you wherever you may be, (even) if you are in unconquerable fortresses. And (their mentality is such that) if some good fortune (benefit) comes to them, they say: ‘It is from Allah (i.e., intermediation and benevolence of the Messenger has no role in it),’ and if some adversity befalls them, they say: ‘(O Messenger!) It is from you (i.e., because of you).’ Say: ‘(In fact,) all comes from Allah.’ So, what has gone wrong with these people that they do not feel inclined to understand anything?"
Women,4,79,"(O man! Train your self this way that) if some good fortune comes to you, (consider that) it is from Allah (do not attribute it to the excellence of your strategy). And when some misfortune befalls, you (believe that) it is from yourself (attribute it to the evil in your own self). And, (O Beloved,) We have sent you as a Messenger to the whole mankind, and Allah is Sufficient as a witness (to your Messengership)."
Women,4,80,"Whoever obeys the Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) obeys (but) Allah indeed, but he who turns away, then We have not sent you to watch over them."
Women,4,81,"And (the state of these hypocrites is such that in your presence) they say: ‘(We) have obeyed (your order).’ But when they depart from your presence, a section of them opine at night contrary to what you have said (and indulge in intriguing consultations). And Allah is recording (all that) which they plot all night. So, (O Beloved Prophet,) turn away your illumined face from them and trust Allah, and Sufficient is Allah as a Guardian."
Women,4,82,"Do they not ponder over the Qur’an? Had this (Qur’an come) from anyone other than Allah, these people would have found in it many contradictions."
Women,4,83,"When there comes to them any news of peace or fear, they spread it around. Had they referred it to the Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him), or those of them who are in command (instead of making it public), then those amongst them who can draw conclusion from some matter would have found it (i.e., the truth of the news). Had there not been Allah’s favour to you and His mercy, certainly you would (all) have followed Satan except only a few."
Women,4,84,"So, (O Beloved,) fight in the cause of Allah (in your defence). You will not be held responsible (for anyone else) but your own soul. And motivate the believers (to fight the miscreants who impose aggression and war upon you). It will be no wonder if Allah smashes the attacking power of the disbelievers. And Allah is Strongest in hold as well as Hardest in punishment."
Women,4,85,"Whoever makes a righteous intercession has a (fixed) share (in its reward), and he who makes an evil intercession has a (fixed) share (in its sin), and Allah has full control over everything."
Women,4,86,"And when you are honoured with (a word of) greeting, then (in reply) greet with a better (salutation) or (at least) reciprocate (in the same words). Surely, Allah takes account of everything."
Women,4,87,Allah is He besides Whom there is none worthy of worship. He shall certainly gather you on the Day of Resurrection about which there is no doubt. And who is more truthful in word than Allah?
Women,4,88,"So what has happened to you that you are split into two groups with regard to the hypocrites, whilst Allah has overturned them (i.e., their reason and contemplation) owing to their misdeeds? Do you seek to guide him to the straight road whom Allah has held strayed (because of his own misdeeds)? And, (O listener,) you cannot at all find a way (of guidance) for him whom Allah holds misguided."
Women,4,89,"They (the hypocrites) wish that you should also disbelieve as they have disbelieved so that you all might become alike. So do not make friends with (any of) them until they emigrate in the way of Allah (in order to prove their sincerity and truthfulness). Then, if they turn away (and start war against you), seize them and kill them wherever you find them (during the war), and take not (any of) them either for a friend or for a helper."
Women,4,90,"But (do not fight) those who have allied with a people that between you and them there is a (peace) treaty, or who (losing heart) come to you in such a state that their breasts are afflicted (with this obsession) whether they should fight you or their own people. If Allah had so willed, He (strengthening their hearts) would have given them supremacy over you. Then they would certainly have fought you. So if they keep away from you and do not fight you and send you (a message) for peace, then (in the interest of peace) Allah has left no way open for you (to launch any aggression) against them."
Women,4,91,"Now you will find another category of people who desire to remain free of any threat from you (by hypocritically pretending to believe), and (also) live in peace from their own community (by siding with disbelievers secretly. But their true state is this that) whenever they are turned to mischief (and wickedness against Muslims), they plunge (headlong) into it. So if they do not give up (fighting against you, nor) send you any (message for) peace, (nor) hold their hands off (their disruptive activities), then seize (and capture) them and kill them wherever you find them. And it is they against whom We have granted you unrestricted authority."
Women,4,92,"And it is not (lawful) for a Muslim to kill a Muslim but by mistake. And anyone who kills a Muslim unintentionally shall (be liable to) free a Muslim slave and (pay) blood money, to be (necessarily) handed over to the heirs of the person slain, unless they remit it. In case, he (the slain) comes from the people who are your enemies and is a believer (as well), then (only) freeing a (male or female) slave is prescribed. But if he (the slain) belongs to a people that between you and them there is a (peace) treaty, then blood compensation must be delivered to his family, and freeing a Muslim (male or female) slave is also mandatory. Then he who does not find (a slave) is (bound) to fast for two consecutive months. (This is his) repentance (prescribed) by Allah. And Allah is All-Knowing, Most Wise."
Women,4,93,"But he who kills a Muslim deliberately, his sentence will be Hell wherein will he abide for ages. Allah will afflict him with His wrath and will cast His curse on him. And He has prepared for him a dreadful torment."
Women,4,94,"O believers! When you set out (to fight) in the way of Allah, carry out a careful probe, and do not say to him who greets you (as a Muslim): ‘You are not a believer.’ You seek goods of the worldly life (in the shape of spoils of war, after killing a Muslim declaring him a disbeliever). So, (rest assured that) Allah has gains and booties in plenty. Before this you (too) were the same. Then Allah conferred on you His Favour (and you became Muslims). So investigate and confirm the truth (about others as well). Surely, Allah is Well Aware of what you do."
Women,4,95,"Those of the Muslims who (shirking fight) stay back (home) without any stressful condition (i.e., excuse), and those who fight in the cause of Allah with their material as well as human resources cannot be equal (in their reward and rank). Allah has exalted in rank those who fight in the cause of Allah with their material as well as human resources above those who stay back withdrawn. Allah has (surely) promised good to all (the believers, yet) He has bestowed the merit of excellence with a mighty reward (and bounty) on those who strive hard over those who stay behind."
Women,4,96,"There are (for them multiple) degrees of higher grades from Him and forgiveness and mercy. And Allah is Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful."
Women,4,97,"Indeed, those whose lives the angels take in such a state that (due to living in an environment of disbelief and dissension) they have ruined their souls, the angels ask them: ‘What condition were you in? (You neither protected your Din [Religion] and faith, nor left the land of disbelief and dissension.)’ They (regretfully) reply: ‘We were powerless and helpless in the land.’ The angels will say: ‘Was Allah’s earth not vast enough for you to migrate in it (somewhere)?’ So it is they whose abode is Hell, and what an evil abode that is!"
Women,4,98,"Except for those really helpless men, women and children who neither are capable to make any plan, nor do they know any way (to escape from there)."
Women,4,99,"They are those whom Allah shall certainly spare, and Allah is Most Pardoning, Most Forgiving."
Women,4,100,"And he who emigrates leaving his home in the way of Allah will find (for hijra—migration) many places in the earth and plentiful provision (for sustenance), and he who leaves his home, migrating towards Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him), and then death overtakes him (on the way), his reward with Allah is ensured and Allah is Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful."
Women,4,101,"And when you travel in the land, there will be no sin on you if you shorten the Prayer (i.e., offer two instead of four mandatory cycles), if you fear that the disbelievers are likely to afflict you with distress. Assuredly, the disbelievers are your open enemies."
Women,4,102,"And, (O Beloved,) when you are (present) amongst these (soldiers), form up for them (congregational) Prayer. A squad of them, retaining their arms, should (first) stand by you (to follow you in Prayer); having performed their prostrations, they should (getting aside) take position in your rear. And (now) another squad who has not (yet) prayed should come up and pray with you (under your leadership); they should (also) hold on to their security measures and retain their weapons (persistently). The infidels want you to become neglectful of your weapons and other means of defence, and that they may launch a sudden attack against you. If you face a problem due to rain or illness, there is no harm if you (remove and) set your weapons aside, and hold fast to your means of security. Verily, Allah has prepared a humiliating torment for the disbelievers."
Women,4,103,"So, (O Muslims,) when you have finished your Prayers, remember Allah (in all postures:) standing, sitting and (lying down) on your sides. And when (free of fear) you feel secure, establish Prayers (as prescribed). Verily, Prayer is obligatory for Muslims in accordance with the fixed timings."
Women,4,104,"And do not slacken in pursuing the foes. If you are afflicted with pain (in this pursuit), then they also face but (similar) suffering as you are exposed to. But you have hope (of reward and bounty) from Allah which they do not. And Allah is All-Knowing, Most Wise."
Women,4,105,"(O Glorious Messenger!) Surely, We have revealed to you the Book based on Truth so that you may judge between the people in accordance with (the Truth) which Allah has shown to you. And (never) become a contender on behalf of the treacherous ones."
Women,4,106,"And implore Allah’s forgiveness. Allah is indeed Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful."
Women,4,107,"And do not plead (in defence of) those who are deceiving their own souls. Surely, Allah does not like anyone who is a committed betrayer and sinner."
Women,4,108,"They hide (their deceitfulness) from people (feeling ashamed), but feel no shame before Allah, whilst He is with them when they hold consultations (secretly) at night about that matter which Allah disapproves. And Allah has encompassed whatever they do."
Women,4,109,"Beware! You are those who pleaded on their behalf in the life of this world, but who will contend with Allah on their behalf (even) on the Day of Resurrection, or who will be their advocate (on that Day too)?"
Women,4,110,"And he who commits evil or wrongs his own soul and then seeks Allah’s forgiveness will find Allah Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful."
Women,4,111,"And whoever commits sin is only bringing (its consequent misery) to his own soul and Allah is All-Knowing, Most Wise."
Women,4,112,And whoever commits some error or sin and then casts its blame on some blameless person has certainly taken (the burden of) a calumny and an open sin.
Women,4,113,"And, (O Beloved,) had not Allah’s bounty and mercy been upon you, a party of these (treacherous) people would have resolved to lead you astray, whereas they are only leading themselves astray and can no way do any harm to you. And Allah has revealed to you the Book and Wisdom and has bestowed upon you all that knowledge which you did not possess. Mighty indeed is Allah’s bounty on you."
Women,4,114,"There is no good in most of their secret consultations except (the counsel) of the person who enjoins charity or piety or peace-making amongst people. And whoever does this, seeking Allah’s pleasure, We shall soon bless him with a mighty reward."
Women,4,115,"But whoever opposes the Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) after the path of guidance has become clear to him, and follows the path other than that of the believers, We shall keep him in the same (state of disorientation) he has (himself) turned to, and shall (eventually) cast him into Hell and that is an evil dwelling."
Women,4,116,"Assuredly, Allah does not forgive (the sin of) setting up any partner with Him, but He forgives any (sin) lesser than that whom He wills. And the one who associates anything with Allah as His partner has surely strayed far off."
Women,4,117,"These (polytheists) merely worship the feminine objects apart from Allah, and they worship only Satan, the rebel,"
Women,4,118,(Satan) on whom Allah has laid His curse and who said: ‘I will certainly take (for myself) an appointed portion of Your servants.
Women,4,119,"I will, for sure, lead them astray, arouse in them foul aspirations and keep directing them. So they will definitely incise the ears of the cattle. And indeed, I shall command them persistently. So they will surely alter what Allah has created.’ And whoever forsakes Allah and takes Satan for a friend will most certainly suffer a perceptible loss."
Women,4,120,"Satan makes (false) promises to them and stirs up in them (deceitful) hopes, and Satan makes not any promise to them except deception."
Women,4,121,"They are the people whose abode is Hell, and they will not find any way to escape from it."
Women,4,122,"But those who have believed and persistently did pious acts, We shall soon admit them to Gardens with rivers flowing beneath. They will reside in them for ever. This is Allah’s true promise, and who can be more truthful in Word than Allah?"
Women,4,123,"(Allah’s promise of salvation) does not accord with what you desire, nor with what the People of the Book aspire to. Whoever does an evil deed will be punished for it, and he will not find for himself any supporter or helper apart from Allah."
Women,4,124,"But anyone, whether man or woman, who does pious acts and is a believer, they are the ones who will enter Paradise and will not be wronged a speck."
Women,4,125,"And with regard to adopting the Din (Religion), who can be better than the one who submits his whole being entirely to Allah, whilst he also holds spiritual excellence, and persistently follows the Din (Religion) of Ibrahim (Abraham)—a devotee (to Allah and) upright? And Allah had taken Ibrahim (Abraham) for a sincere and intimate friend. (So, he also becomes Allah’s friend by virtue of his spiritual affiliation to Ibrahim [Abraham].)"
Women,4,126,And to Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth and Allah has encompassed everything.
Women,4,127,"And, (O Prophet,) people ask about your edict on matters concerning (orphan) women. Say: ‘Allah ordains you in their case, and the commandment (already) being communicated to you in the holy Book (also) pertains to those orphan women whom you deny (the rights) which have been prescribed for them. And (in order to take their assets into possession) you want to marry them. In addition to that, there is (also a decree) on affairs concerning helpless minor children, that stick to justice in matters of orphans. And whatever good you do, Allah is indeed Well Aware of that."
Women,4,128,"If a woman fears maltreatment or indifference on the part of her husband, there is no harm if both (husband and wife) reconcile on some appropriate accord, and reconciliation (in truth) is best. The human nature has (no doubt) been made (more or less) self-seeking, but if you practise benevolence and guard yourselves against evil, Allah is indeed Well Aware of the works that you do."
Women,4,129,"And you simply do not have the ability to do (ideal) justice amongst your (more than one) wives, however ardently you may desire to do it. Do not, therefore, incline with absolute fondness (towards one, thus) leaving the other like something suspended (in the midst). But if you mend your ways and refrain (from injustice and maltreatment), Allah is Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful."
Women,4,130,"And if both (husband and wife) end up in separation, Allah will make each of them independent (of the other) out of His own abundance and Allah is All-Embracing, Most Wise."
Women,4,131,"And to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth. And no doubt We enjoined those (too) who were given the Book before you, and (have ordained) you (as well) to keep fearing Allah. But if you disobey, then assuredly whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth (all) belongs to Allah, and Allah is Beyond all Needs, Ever-Praiseworthy."
Women,4,132,And to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth; and enough is Allah to be the Guardian.
Women,4,133,"O people! If He wills, He may eliminate you and bring others (in your place) and Allah is All-Powerful to do this."
Women,4,134,"Whoever desires the reward of the world, then with Allah is the reward of (both) the world and the Hereafter and Allah is All-Hearing, All-Seeing."
Women,4,135,"O believers! Become tenaciously firm on justice, bearing witness (merely) for the sake of Allah even if (the witness) is against your own selves or (your) parents or (your) relatives. Whether the person (against whom is the evidence) is rich or poor, Allah is a greater Well-Wisher of them both (than you are). So do not follow the desires of your (ill-commanding) selves lest you swerve from justice. But if (whilst giving evidence) you twist your statement or evade (the truth), then Allah is indeed Well Aware of (all the works) that you are doing."
Women,4,136,"O believers! Put faith in Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) and in the Book which He has revealed to His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) and the Book that He revealed before (it). And he who denies Allah, His angels, His Books, His Messengers and the Last Day has surely strayed far away."
Women,4,137,"Indeed, those who believe, then disbelieve and then believe again and reject faith once more and then advance further in denying faith, Allah will never (incline to) forgive them, nor guide them to the straight road."
Women,4,138,(O Prophet!) Convey to the hypocrites the news that a grievous torment awaits them.
Women,4,139,"(They are) those who consider the (hostile) disbelievers instead of the believers as their supporters. Do they seek honour in their company? So, all veneration (and glory) belongs only to Almighty Allah."
Women,4,140,"And indeed, Allah has revealed to you this (command) in the Book that when you hear Allah’s Revelations being denied and ridiculed, do not sit in their company until they engage in some other discourse (renouncing the denial and ridicule). Otherwise you too will become like them. Surely, Allah will assemble the hypocrites and the disbelievers together in Hell."
Women,4,141,"Those (hypocrites) who pry into your (victory and setback), then if you are granted victory by Allah, say: ‘Were we not with you?’ And if the disbelievers get a portion (of some apparent breakthrough), they say (to them): ‘Did we not get the better of you, and (in spite of that) did we not save you from (ruin at the hands of) the Muslims?’ So, Allah will judge between you on the Day of Resurrection, and never will Allah allow the disbelievers anyway to (overpower) the Muslims."
Women,4,142,"Surely, the hypocrites (self-deluding) seek to deceive Allah, whilst He is to make them suffer for their (own) deception. And when they stand up for Prayer, they do it sluggishly, (simply) for showing off to the people. And they (also) remember Allah but little."
Women,4,143,"Confounded between (belief and disbelief), they belong neither to (the disbelievers) nor to (the believers). And he whom Allah holds astray you shall not find for him any road (to guidance)."
Women,4,144,O believers! Do not consider (hostile) disbelievers as (your) reliable supporters instead of believers. Do you wish to set a manifest evidence for Allah against you (through friendship with the hostile disbelievers)?
Women,4,145,"The hypocrites will surely be in the lowest depth of Hell, and you will never find for them any helper."
Women,4,146,"But those who repent, make amends, and establish a firm bond with Allah, and make their Din (faith and devotion) sincerely for Allah—they will be in the company of the believers. And Allah will soon bestow a tremendous reward upon the believers."
Women,4,147,"Why should Allah torment you if you become grateful and believe? And Allah is Most Appreciative (of every truth), Well Aware (of every act)."
Women,4,148,"Allah does not like anyone’s foul words being voiced loud (publicly and openly) except by one who has been a victim of oppression (he is allowed to expose the cruelty of the oppressor), and Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing."
Women,4,149,"Whether you make a good act known or keep it hidden or excuse some(one’s) evil act, Allah is indeed Most Forgiving, All-Powerful."
Women,4,150,"Surely, those who disbelieve in Allah and His Messengers and seek to discriminate between Allah and His Messengers and say: ‘We believe in some and deny the others,’ and intend to find a way in between (belief and disbelief),"
Women,4,151,They are the ones who are in fact the disbelievers. And We have prepared a humiliating torment for the disbelievers.
Women,4,152,"But those who believed in Allah and (all) His Messengers and, (in embracing faith,) made no distinction between any of these (Messengers), He will soon pay them their rewards. And Allah is Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful."
Women,4,153,"(O Beloved!) The People of the Book ask you to bring down to them a Book from heaven (completely inscribed in one go). They asked Musa (Moses) for something even greater than that; they said: ‘Show us Allah visibly (in Person).’ So owing to (their) transgression (i.e., this denigrating demand), a thunderbolt seized them. (They died and were later raised to life by Musa’s [Moses’s] prayer.) Then they adopted the calf (as their god) after the clear signs (pointing to the truth) had reached them. Then We overlooked this (sin) as well, and bestowed upon Musa (Moses) a marked dominance over them."
Women,4,154,"And (when the Jews again rejected the injunctions contained in the Torah,) We raised (and suspended Mount) Tur over them in order to take a (firm) promise from them. And We commanded them: ‘Enter the gate (of this city—the Ailia gate) prostrate (in gratitude),’ and We (also) said to them: ‘Do not also violate the Sabbath (prohibition of fishing on Saturday), and We took from them a reiterated and firm promise.’"
Women,4,155,"So (they were afflicted with punishments) because of their breaking the promise, rejecting the Revelations of Allah, killing the Prophets unjustly (and also owing to) their saying: ‘Our hearts are (wrapped) in covers.’ (Nay, that was not the truth;) the fact is that Allah has sealed their hearts due to their disbelief, so, except for a few, they will not accept faith;"
Women,4,156,And (moreover) due to their rejection of faith and uttering against Maryam (Mary) a grave calumny;
Women,4,157,"And (also) because of their uttering (the boastful claim): ‘We (have) killed Allah’s Messenger, the Messiah, ‘Isa, the son of Maryam (Jesus, the son of Mary),’ whereas they neither killed nor crucified him. But (in truth) someone was made the like (of ‘Isa—Jesus) in their view. But those who disagree about him have surely fallen prey to doubt (concerning) this (murder). They know nothing (what the truth is) except (that they are) following fancy. And they certainly did not murder ‘Isa (Jesus)."
Women,4,158,"In fact, Allah lifted him up towards Himself (in heaven) and Allah is Almighty, Most Wise."
Women,4,159,"And, (shortly before the Last Hour at the time of the Messiah’s descent,) there will not be any (individual or sect) of the People of the Book, but will (rightly) believe in ‘Isa (Jesus) before his death; and ‘Isa (Jesus) will bear witness to them on the Day of Resurrection."
Women,4,160,"Then on account of injustice on the part of the Jews, We made unlawful for them (many) pure provisions that had been made lawful for them (before), and (also) for the reason that they hindered (people) at a large scale from the path of Allah."
Women,4,161,"And (also) because of their taking usury, despite that they were forbidden to do it, and because of their usurping others’ wealth wrongfully (they were punished). And We have prepared a torturous torment for those of them who disbelieve."
Women,4,162,"But those amongst them who possess substantial knowledge and faith (equally) believe in (the Revelation) that has been sent down to you and (the Revelation) that was sent down before you. And (how righteous they are!) they establish the Prayer regularly, and pay Zakat (the Alms-due) persistently, and keep faith in Allah and the Day of Resurrection. They are the ones whom We shall soon pay a mighty wage."
Women,4,163,"(O Beloved!) Indeed, We have sent Revelation to you as We sent it to Nuh (Noah) and (other) Messengers after him; and We also sent Revelation to Ibrahim (Abraham), Isma‘il (Ishmael), Ishaq (Isaac), Ya‘qub (Jacob) and (his) children, and ‘Isa (Jesus), Ayyub (Job), Yunus (Jonah), Harun (Aaron) and Sulayman (Solomon); and We conferred the Zabur (the Book of Psalms) upon Dawud (David)."
Women,4,164,And (We have sent many) Messengers whose annals We have narrated to you earlier; and We sent (a number of) those Messengers whose details We have not (yet) related to you; and Allah (also) spoke to Musa (Moses) directly.
Women,4,165,"The Messengers who were Bearers of good news and Warners (were sent) so that after (the arrival of these) Messengers people may not have any plea against Allah. And Allah is Almighty, Most Wise."
Women,4,166,"(O Beloved! Whether somebody believes in your Prophethood or not,) Allah (Himself) bears witness to (this fact that) whatever He has sent down to you has sent down with His knowledge. And the angels (too) bear witness to that effect (for your sake), and Allah is All-Sufficient as a witness."
Women,4,167,"Verily, those who disbelieved (i.e., belied the Prophethood of Muhammad [blessings and peace be upon him]) and hindered (people) from the path of Allah, they undoubtedly went far astray (from the truth)."
Women,4,168,"Indeed, those who have disbelieved (by denying Allah’s witness) and done injustice (by denying the Messenger’s glory), Allah will by no means forgive them, nor will show them any path (on the Day of Judgment),"
Women,4,169,Except the path of Hell wherein they shall dwell beyond the count of time and that is easy for Allah.
Women,4,170,"O mankind! Indeed, this Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) has come to you with the truth from your Lord. So believe (in him) for your own good. But if you disbelieve (i.e., deny his Prophethood, then bear in mind that He is Beyond Any Need of you because) whatever is in the heavens and the earth belongs to Allah indeed. And Allah is All-Knowing, Most Wise."
Women,4,171,"O People of the Book! Exceed not the limits in your din (religion), and speak nothing but the truth about Allah’s glory. The fact is simple that the Messiah, ‘Isa, the son of Maryam (Jesus, the son of Mary) is Allah’s Messenger and His Word which He conveyed to Maryam (Mary) and a Spirit from Him. So believe in Allah and His Messengers and do not say: ‘There are three (Gods).’ Refrain (from this belief); (that) is best for you. Verily, Allah is the Only One God, Holy is He, far above having a son. Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth (all) belongs to Him alone. And Sufficient is Allah as a Guardian."
Women,4,172,"The Messiah feels no embarrassment in being a servant of Allah. Nor do the closest angels (ever feel ashamed). And whoever disdains to be His servant and perpetrates arrogance, He will soon assemble together all such people before Him."
Women,4,173,"So those who believe and persist in doing pious deeds, He will pay them their wages in full and will (then) award them more out of His bounty. But those who disdain (worshipping Allah) and behave arrogantly, He will punish them with grievous torment, and they will not find for them any friend or helper besides Allah."
Women,4,174,"O mankind! (The most vital, perfect, clear and) conclusive evidence has reached you from your (Ever-Glorious and Most Exalted) Lord (in the form of the Holy Being of the Prophet Muhammad [Blessings and peace be upon him]). And (besides) We have (also) sent down to you the brightening and radiant light (in the shape of the Holy Qur’an)."
Women,4,175,"So, those who believe in Allah and hold fast to His (embrace, Allah) will soon admit them to His (exceptional) mercy and grace and will show them the straight path to (reach) Him."
Women,4,176,"They seek edict (i.e., judgment under Islamic law) from you. Say: ‘Allah ordains pertaining to (the inheritance of) kalala (the deceased leaving neither children nor parents behind): If a man dies childless but has one sister, she shall have (as her share) half (the property) that he leaves. (If, on the contrary, a sister is kalala, then in the case of her death) the brother will be (the sole) heir (to his sister), if she has no children. Then, if (after a kalala brother’s death) two (sisters) are (the heirs), they are entitled to share two-thirds of (the property) he leaves. And if (in the case of the deceased who is kalala) he has some brothers and sisters, male (as well as) female heirs, then the share of each male shall be as much as the (portion of) two females.’ Allah is clearly explaining (these laws) to you lest you should go astray. And Allah knows everything well."
The Table Spread,5,1,"O believers! Fulfil (your) promises. The quadrupeds (i.e., cattle) have been made lawful for you except those (animals) that will be announced to you afterwards. (But) when clad in ihram (the Pilgrim’s sacred dress), do not presume hunting lawful. Surely, Allah ordains what He wills."
The Table Spread,5,2,"O believers! Do not denigrate the signs of Allah, nor the sacred (and venerable) month (i.e., any one of Dhu al-Qa‘da, Dhu al-Hijja, Muharram and Rajab), nor the sacrificial animals sent to the Sacred House—the Ka‘ba—nor the animals brought to Mecca with ritual straps around their necks. Also do not violate the sanctity (of life and property, and honour and dignity) of those resorting to the Sacred House, the Ka‘ba, (for they are the ones) seeking bounty and pleasure of their Lord. And when you take off ihram (the Pilgrim’s garb), then you are allowed to hunt. And never let the enmity of a people incite you to aggression (against them) since they barred you from the Sacred House (i.e., visiting the Ka‘ba). And always support one another in (the works of) righteousness and piety, but do not become accomplices in (works of) sin and transgression. And fear Allah persistently. Indeed, Allah awards severe punishment (to those who disobey and defy)."
The Table Spread,5,3,"Forbidden to you is carrion (the animal that dies and is not slaughtered according to Islamic law) and (the discharged) blood and pork and that (animal) on which the name of someone other than Allah has been invoked whilst slaughtering and (the animal) that dies by strangling or by a violent blow (not by any sharp instrument) or by falling from a height or the one that has been gored to death or which has been ripped apart and gnawed by a wild beast, save the one which you slaughter (before it dies), and (that animal too is forbidden) which has been slaughtered on idolatrous altars (dedicated to false gods). And this (is also unlawful) that you learn your fortune through divining (with arrows or divide shares by such means). All these works are sins. This day, the disbelievers have lost all hopes of (their heinous designs because) your Din ([Religion] has prevailed). So, (O believers,) fear them not and always fear Me alone. Today I have perfected your Din (Religion) for you, and have completed My Blessing upon you, and have chosen for you Islam (as) Din (a complete code of life). Then if someone gets into a survival situation (and is forced by) ravenous hunger (and intense thirst i.e., driven by dire necessity, provided) he is not prone to sinning (i.e., eats what is forbidden without being wilfully inclined to sin), then Allah is indeed Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful."
The Table Spread,5,4,"People ask you what has been made lawful for them. Say (to them): ‘The pure provisions are declared lawful for you.’ And the hunting animals that you have tamed running after game and, this way, teach them (the methods of hunting) which Allah has taught you; so eat (also) of that (prey) which the hunting animals hold on for you (after hunting). And pronounce the Name of Allah over that (hunting beast when you unleash it for hunting). And keep fearing Allah. Indeed, Allah is Swift in calling to account."
The Table Spread,5,5,"This day, good and pure things have been made lawful for you. And the sacrificed animal of those given the (Revealed) Book is (also) lawful for you, whilst your sacrificed animal is lawful for them. And (likewise) chaste Muslim women as well as chaste women from amongst those given the Book before you (are lawful for you) when you have paid them their dower, (provided) you marry them for a conjugal life (adhering to chasteness and decency), and not for open lasciviousness (merely satisfying your lust), nor for secret love affairs. The one who denies faith (in the commandments of Allah), all his work is ruined, and he will (also) be amongst the losers in the Hereafter."
The Table Spread,5,6,"O believers! When (you intend) to stand for Prayer, then, (for ablution,) wash your faces and hands up to the elbows, and pass your wet hands over your heads and (also wash) your feet up to the ankles. And if you are in a state of obligation for total ablution, purify yourselves well (by bathing). Should you be ill or on a journey, or someone of you comes (after) defecation, or you have had sexual contact with women and then you do not find water, (in these cases,) perform tayammum with clean soil. So, it is wiping your faces and (full) hands with it (i.e., clean soil). Allah does not want to make things hard for you, but He wants to purify you, and complete the bestowal of His favour upon you so that you may become grateful."
The Table Spread,5,7,"And call to mind the favour of Allah (conferred) upon you, and (also recall) the promise which He took from you (under affirmation) when you declared (agreeing): ‘We heard (Allah’s command) and we obeyed (it).’ And always fear Allah. Verily, Allah knows best (the secrets of) hearts."
The Table Spread,5,8,"O believers! Holding fast to the cause of Allah, bear witness based on justice. And let not (even) the extreme hostility against a people provoke you into abstaining from justice (in their case). Always do justice, (for) it is closer to piousness. And fear Allah. Indeed, Allah is Well Aware of your works."
The Table Spread,5,9,Allah has promised forgiveness and a mighty reward for those who believe and persist in piety and righteous actions.
The Table Spread,5,10,"But those who disbelieve and deny Our Revelations, they are the people who will be (on fire) in Hell."
The Table Spread,5,11,O believers! Call to mind the favour of Allah (which) was bestowed upon you when a people (who disbelieved) resolved to stretch out their hands against you (for killing and destruction) but Allah held back their hands from you. And always fear Allah; and the believers must always rely on Allah alone.
The Table Spread,5,12,"And indeed, Allah took a firm promise from the Children of Israel, and We appointed amongst them twelve chieftains (for its fulfilment, enforcement and protection). And Allah said (to the Children of Israel): ‘I am with you (i.e., My special support and reinforcement will escort you).’ If you establish Prayer and pay Zakat (the Alms-due) consistently, and (always) adhere to believing in My Messengers, and furnish persistent support to their (Prophetic Mission), and lend Allah a handsome loan (for the financial support, promotion and prevalence of His Din [Religion]), I will certainly remove your sins from you, and will assuredly admit you to the Gardens with streams flowing beneath. Then, later, whoever from amongst you rejects faith (i.e., violates the promise) indeed strays from the straight path."
The Table Spread,5,13,"Then We laid Our curse on them because of their breach of promise (i.e., they were deprived of Our mercy), and We made their hearts callous (i.e., they were deprived of guidance and susceptibility. So,) they change the Words (of Allah’s Book) from their (right) places, and have forgotten a (major) portion of that (guidance) which they were urged upon. And you will continue being informed about one or the other of their treachery, except a few of them (who have embraced faith). So pardon them and forbear. Indeed, Allah loves the benefactors."
The Table Spread,5,14,"And We (also) took a (similar) promise from those who say: ‘We are Christians.’ Then they (too) forgot a (major) portion of that (guidance) which they were urged upon. So, (owing to this breach of promise,) We infected them with mutual hostility and spite till the Day of Resurrection. And Allah will soon unveil to them (the reality of the acts) which they used to perpetrate."
The Table Spread,5,15,"O People of the Book! Indeed, there has come to you Our Messenger who (clearly) unfolds to you many such things from the Book as you have been concealing and who overlooks many of (your) wrongs (too). There has indeed come to you a light from Allah (i.e., Muhammad [blessings and peace be upon him]) and an Enlightening Book (i.e., the Holy Qur’an)."
The Table Spread,5,16,"By this Allah guides those who seek His pleasure to the paths to peace (and security), and takes them out of darkness (of ignorance and disbelief) by His command, and leads them to the light (of faith and guidance), and directs them towards the straight road."
The Table Spread,5,17,"They have indeed committed disbelief who say: ‘Verily, Allah is (but) the Messiah, the son of Maryam (Mary).’ Say: ‘Who is then (the one) who can possess a bit (of the will) of Allah if He should so decide as to destroy Messiah, the son of Maryam, and his mother, and all that are on earth (who can save them against His will)?’ And the sovereignty of the heavens, the earth and (the universe) that exists between them, (all) belongs to Allah alone. He creates what He wills and Allah has absolute power over everything."
The Table Spread,5,18,"And the Jews and the Christians say: ‘We are the sons of Allah and His beloved ones.’ Say: ‘(If your statement is correct) then why does He punish you for your sins?’ Rather (the truth is that) from amongst all (the Creation) Allah has brought into being, you (too) are (but) human beings (i.e., just like other human species). He forgives whom He pleases and chastises whom He wills. And the sovereignty of the heavens, the earth and (the universe) that exists between them, (all) belongs to Allah alone and to Him (everyone) has to return."
The Table Spread,5,19,"O People of the Book! Indeed, Our (Last) Prophet has come to you (at the juncture) when (the chain of) Messengers’ succession is breaking off, and he expounds to you (Our commands and injunctions) with ample clarity, (because) you may (by way of excuse) say: ‘There has come to us no Bearer of good news or a Warner.’ (Now this excuse of yours has also lost ground because) undoubtedly, (the Final) Bearer of glad tidings and Warner has come to you, and Allah has absolute power over everything."
The Table Spread,5,20,"And (recall) when Musa (Moses) said to his people: ‘O my people! Recollect the blessing Allah (bestowed) upon you when He raised Prophets from amongst you, and made you kings and gave (so) much to you as He had not given to anyone else in all the worlds (in your contemporary period)."
The Table Spread,5,21,"O my people! Enter the holy land (of Syria or Bayt al-Maqdis [Jerusalem]) which Allah has decreed for you, and do not turn back (in retreat), or you will turn back as losers.’"
The Table Spread,5,22,"They said (in reply): ‘O Musa (Moses)! There are mighty (i.e., tyrant) people (living) therein, and we shall never enter this (land) until they leave it. So, if they depart from here, then we will certainly enter it.’"
The Table Spread,5,23,"Two men from amongst (a few) who feared (Allah) and whom Allah had favoured with His Blessing (said to their folk:) ‘Enter the gate (of the city invading) these people (dauntlessly). Once you enter this (gate), you will certainly be victorious. And put your trust in Allah alone, provided you are people of faith.’"
The Table Spread,5,24,They said: ‘O Musa (Moses)! Never shall we enter this (land) so long as they are in it. So you (along with) your Lord go and fight; we are sitting right here.’
The Table Spread,5,25,(Musa [Moses]) submitted: ‘My Lord! I have no control (over anyone) except for myself and my brother (Harun [Aaron]). So put us apart from (these) wicked people (by Your command).’
The Table Spread,5,26,"(The Lord) said: ‘So this (land) is forbidden to these (rebels) for forty years. (Anguished,) they will continue wandering around the earth in distraction. So grieve not, (O Musa [Moses],) over the (warning plight) of these disobedient and unruly people.’"
The Table Spread,5,27,"(O Most Esteemed Messenger!) Relate to these people the account of the two sons of Adam (Habil and Qabil [Abel and Cain]) which is absolutely true. When both of them made offering (one each to Allah), the offering from one of them (Habil [Abel]) was accepted, whilst that from the other (Qabil [Cain]) was not accepted. Thereupon, he (Qabil) said to Habil (out of jealousy and vengeance): ‘I will surely kill you.’ He (Habil) said (in reply): ‘Indeed, Allah accepts (offering) only from the people of piety."
The Table Spread,5,28,"If you stretch forth your hand against me to kill me, (even then) I shall not stretch out my hand against you in order to kill you because I fear Allah, the Sustainer of all the worlds."
The Table Spread,5,29,"I want (I commit no offence and) you take my sin (i.e., the sin of killing me), and also your own sin (the preceding one on account of which your offering has been rejected all) on you. You will then become one of the inmates of Hell. And that is but the punishment of the wrongdoers.’"
The Table Spread,5,30,"Then the (ill-commanding) self of Qabil (Cain) made the killing of his brother Habil (Abel) easy (and tempting) for him. So, he killed him and became one of the losers."
The Table Spread,5,31,"Then Allah sent a crow that started scratching the earth to show him how to hide his brother’s corpse. (Seeing this,) he said: ‘Alas! Could I not become even the like of this crow that I might hide the corpse of my brother!’ So he became one of the remorseful people."
The Table Spread,5,32,"On account of this, We prescribed (this commandment in the Torah sent down) to the Children of Israel that whoever killed a person (unjustly), except as a punishment for murder or for (spreading) disorder in the land, it would be as if he killed all the people (of society); and whoever (saved him from unjust murder and) made him survive, it would be as if he saved the lives of all the people (of society, i.e., he rescued the collective system of human life). And indeed, Our Messengers came to them with evident signs. Yet, even after that, the majority from amongst these people are certainly those who commit excesses in the land."
The Table Spread,5,33,"Indeed, those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) and remain engaged in creating mischief in the land (i.e., perpetrate bloodshed, terrorism, robbery, burglary and massacre amongst Muslims), their punishment is that they should be slain, or hanged to death, or their hands and their feet on opposite sides should be cut off, or they should be exiled far from (i.e., deprived of moving about in) the homeland (i.e., either by banishment or by imprisonment). That is the humiliation for them in this world, and for them there is a terrible torment in the Hereafter (as well),"
The Table Spread,5,34,"Except those who turn to Allah in repentance before you overpower them. So, know that Allah is Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful."
The Table Spread,5,35,O believers! Fear Allah persistently and keep looking for means to (approach and get closer to) Him and strive hard in His way so that you may prosper.
The Table Spread,5,36,"Assuredly, those who disbelieve, if they possess all (the riches and treasures) that exist in the earth, and even with it as much more, so that they may offer it as ransom (i.e., a recompense for their souls to redeem themselves) from the torment of the Day of Resurrection, (all that too) will not be accepted from them and there is a torturous punishment for them."
The Table Spread,5,37,"They will desire to get out of Hell (somehow), whereas they will not be able to get out of it. And their torment will be eternal."
The Table Spread,5,38,"(After proper judicial trial as per law,) cut off the hands of both the man as well as the woman who steal, in retribution of (the offence) which they have committed, a deterring punishment from Allah. And Allah is Almighty, Most Wise."
The Table Spread,5,39,"Then the one who repents after (this) wrong and mends his ways, Allah surely turns towards him in mercy. Allah is indeed Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful."
The Table Spread,5,40,(O man!) Do you not know that (the absolute) sovereignty of the heavens and the earth belongs to Allah alone? He torments whom He wills and forgives whom He pleases and Allah has absolute power over everything.
The Table Spread,5,41,"O Messenger! Those who advance (fast) into disbelief should not grieve you. (Firstly) they include those (hypocrites) who utter from their mouths: ‘We believe,’ whilst their hearts have not accepted faith. (Secondly) amongst them are the Jews. They listen to (you) eagerly to fabricate lies. They (in fact) hear (to spy) for others who have not (yet) come to you. (They are the people) who change the Words (of Allah even) after their contexts (are fixed and) say: ‘If you are given this (command which they like), take it, and if you are not given this (command), then keep off (it).’ And if Allah adjudges someone to go astray, then you do not have any power for him (to hold up the command of) Allah. They are the ones whose hearts Allah has no intention whatsoever to purify. For them there is ignominy (of disbelief) in this world and mighty punishment in the Hereafter."
The Table Spread,5,42,"(They are) the ones who spy to coin lies. (Moreover,) they voraciously devour unlawful wealth and property. If they approach you (with a dispute for judgment), then it is (up to) you whether to judge between them or decline. And if you opt to keep away from them, (even then) they are incapable of doing you any harm, and if you judge, then judge between them (too but) with justice (i.e., their enmity should not restrain judgment based on justice). Undoubtedly, Allah loves those who do justice."
The Table Spread,5,43,And how can they accept you as a judge whilst they have the Torah with them wherein is (revealed) the commandment of Allah? Yet they turn away (from the truth even) after that. And they are the ones who will not (at all) embrace faith.
The Table Spread,5,44,"Indeed, We revealed the Torah wherein was guidance and light. In accordance with that the Messengers who were the obedient (servants of Allah) used to give orders to the Jews. And the divines (i.e., their spiritual masters) and the rabbis (also judged in accordance with that) because they were assigned to safeguard the Book of Allah and they were the guardians of (and witnesses to) it. So do not fear people and always fear Me (alone), and do not barter My signs (i.e., commands) for a paltry price (of this world). And he who does not judge (and rule) according to the injunctions sent down by Allah, it is they who are the disbelievers."
The Table Spread,5,45,"In that (the Torah) We had prescribed for them: a life for a life, an eye for an eye, a nose for a nose, an ear for an ear, and a tooth for a tooth, and in the case of injuries (too) there is a requital. But the person who (forgoes) this (requital) by way of charity, this will serve as an atonement for his (sins). And he who does not judge (and rule) in compliance with the commandments sent down by Allah, it is they who are the transgressors."
The Table Spread,5,46,"And following in the footsteps of these (Messengers) We sent ‘Isa, the son of Maryam (Jesus, the son of Mary) confirming the Book (the Torah) revealed before him. And We gave him the Injil (the Gospel) which contained guidance and light, and (the Injil [the Gospel] too) confirmed the (Book) Torah that preceded it. And it was (an absolute) guidance and admonition for the Godfearing."
The Table Spread,5,47,"And the People of the Injil ([the Gospel] too) are required to judge in accordance with that (commandment) which Allah has sent down in it. And he who does not judge (and run the state) complying with the commandments Allah has revealed, it is they who are unruly and wicked."
The Table Spread,5,48,"And, (O Most Esteemed Messenger,) We have revealed the Book to you (also) with the truth which confirms the Book that preceded it and stands as a guardian over (the actual commands and contents contained in) it. So judge between them according to these (commandments) which Allah has revealed. And do not follow their desires turning away from the truth that has come to you. We have designed for each one of you a discrete law and an all-embracing way of life. Had Allah so willed, He would have made you all one Umma ([Community] agreeing to the same law). But He wants to test you in these (separately given sets of commandments) which He has given you (suiting your respective life situations). So, make haste in doing pious works. To Allah have you all to return. He will then enlighten you on (the truth and falsehood in all the matters) in which you used to disagree."
The Table Spread,5,49,"And, (O Beloved, We have enjoined that) you should judge between them by this (commandment) which Allah has revealed and do not follow their desires. And be on your guard against them lest they tempt you away from any of (the commandments) which Allah has revealed to you. But if they turn away (from your judgment), then know that Allah intends to punish them for some of their sins. And most of the people are unruly and disobedient."
The Table Spread,5,50,Do they seek the law of (the days of) ignorance? And who is better than Allah in (giving) judgment for a people who have firm faith?
The Table Spread,5,51,"O believers! Do not consider (hostile) Jews and Christians as (your) reliable allies. They (all) are friends to one another (against you). And whoever of you makes friends with them will (also) become one of them. Surely, Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people."
The Table Spread,5,52,"So you will see those whose hearts are diseased (with hypocrisy and minds infected with slavery) that they run to (join the Jews and the Christians and) say: ‘We fear lest the wheel of fate should turn against us (i.e., it is likely to get under the security umbrella by allying with them).’ But it is not far from possible that Allah (really) blesses (the Muslims) with victory or may (send) from His side a decree (as a sign of success and victory). Then they will feel ashamed of (the hypocritical thinking) they have concealed in their hearts."
The Table Spread,5,53,And (at that time) the believers will say: ‘Is it they who swore by Allah (by way of) solemn oaths that they were certainly with you (alone)?’ (But) all their deeds have gone void. So they have become the losers.
The Table Spread,5,54,"O believers! Whoever of you turns away from his Din (Religion), Allah will soon bring (in their place) a people He will (Himself) love and who will love Him. They will be kind (and humble) towards the believers (but) strict (and firm) towards the disbelievers. They will toil (very hard) in the way of Allah and will never fear any reproaches of the reprovers. This (constructive character) is the grace of Allah which He grants whom He wills, and Allah is Infinite, All-Knowing."
The Table Spread,5,55,"Indeed, your real helper and friend is only Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) and the believers (as well) who persevere in offering Prayer and pay Zakat (the Alms-due) and they are those who bow down (with extreme submissiveness before the presence of Allah)."
The Table Spread,5,56,"And the one who makes friends with Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) and the believers, then (they are the people who are Allah’s party), and (it is the people of) Allah’s party who will surely overmaster."
The Table Spread,5,57,O believers! Do not take those for friends who have made fun and sport of your Din (Religion) from amongst those who were given the Book before you and the disbelievers. And fear Allah persistently if you are (truly) the men of faith.
The Table Spread,5,58,"And when you call (the people) to Prayer (by means of the Adhan—the Call to Prayer), these (people) take it as fun and sport because they are a people who have no sense (at all)."
The Table Spread,5,59,(O Esteemed Messenger!) Say: ‘O People of the Book! What has made you cynic about us except that we believe in Allah and this (Book) which has been revealed to us and those (Books) which have been sent down before it? And surely the majority of you are defiant and disobedient.’
The Table Spread,5,60,"Say: ‘Shall I apprise you of him who, in the matter of punishment, is worse in the sight of Allah than (the one you regard the most despised? And it is he) whom Allah has cursed, whom He has shown His wrath, and He has transformed (some) of these (evil people) into apes and (others into) swines; and (he is such a person) as has (obeyed and) worshipped Satan. They are the people who are the most wretched with regard to their dwelling, and far more astray from the straight path.’"
The Table Spread,5,61,"And when those (hypocrites) come to you, they say: ‘We have believed,’ whilst they entered (your company) with disbelief and left with the same (disbelief). And Allah knows best (the matters) which they carry hidden."
The Table Spread,5,62,And you will see the majority of them hurrying towards sins and excesses and eagerly devouring what is forbidden (and unlawful). Most evil indeed is all that they are doing.
The Table Spread,5,63,"Why do the divines (i.e., spiritual masters) and rabbis abstain from forbidding them from their sinful speech and consumption of unlawful things? Certainly, it is most heinous what they are contriving (by abstaining from raising voices against evil)."
The Table Spread,5,64,"And the Jews say: ‘Allah’s hand is tied up (as if—God forbid!—He is miserly).’ Tied up be their (own) hands, and they have been cursed for what they have uttered! (The truth is that) both His hands are stretched out wide open (in showering His bounties and blessings). He spends (i.e., bestows His blessings on His servants) as He desires. And, (O Beloved,) the (Book) which has been revealed to you from your Lord will certainly increase most of them in rebellion and disbelief (due to jealousy). And We have put among them hostility and spite till the Day of Resurrection. Whenever these people kindle the fire of war, Allah puts it out. And they are engaged in spreading mischief and disorder (everywhere) on the earth, and Allah does not like those who spread mischief."
The Table Spread,5,65,"And if the People of the Book had believed (in Muhammad, the Messenger, [blessings and peace be upon him]) and adopted Godwariness, We would have removed all their sins (from their record), and would surely have admitted them to the blissful Gardens."
The Table Spread,5,66,"And had they established (their systems by enforcing) the Torah and the Injil (the Gospel), and whatever (more) was sent down to them from their Lord, they would have (been provided with the material resources so abundantly that they would have) received sustenance from above and from beneath their feet (as well, but the sustenance would never have exhausted). A section amongst them are moderate (i.e., they like the middle way), but what most of them are doing is extreme wickedness."
The Table Spread,5,67,"O (Esteemed) Messenger! Communicate (to the people all) that has been revealed to you from your Lord. And if you did not do (so), then you would not deliver the Message of the Lord. And Allah will (Himself) protect your (life) from the (hostile) people. Surely, Allah does not show the path of guidance to those who disbelieve."
The Table Spread,5,68,"Say: ‘O People of the Book, you are nowhere (on the path of Din [Religion]) until you establish (the system by enforcing) the Torah and the Injil (the Gospel) and whatever has been sent down to you from your Lord. And, (O Beloved,) the Book which has been sent down to you from your Lord will certainly provoke rebellion and disbelief amongst most of them (because of jealousy). So do not grieve over (the state of affairs of) the disbelievers."
The Table Spread,5,69,"Indeed, (those who call themselves) the Muslims, the Jews, the Sabeans (i.e., the worshippers of stars) and the Christians, all who believe (true-heartedly in accordance with the teachings of Muhammad [blessings and peace be upon him]) in Allah and the Last Day and practise piety steadfastly shall have neither any fear nor any grief."
The Table Spread,5,70,"Surely, We took a promise from the Children of Israel (too), and (also) sent (many) Messengers towards them, (but) every time a Messenger brought them a commandment which their (ill-commanding) selves disliked, they belied a party (of the Messengers) and slew the other (in succession)."
The Table Spread,5,71,"And (besides) they held the view that (killing or belying the Messengers) would not result in any torment. So they became blind and deaf. Allah, then, accepted their repentance. But most of them (again) turned blind and deaf (i.e., incapable of perceiving the truth by seeing and hearing). And Allah is Ever-Watchful of what they are doing."
The Table Spread,5,72,"In fact, they have become disbelievers who say: ‘Allah is the Messiah, the son of Maryam (Mary),’ whereas the Messiah (himself) said: ‘O Children of Israel! Worship Allah, Who is my (as well as) your Lord.’ Indeed, Allah has forbidden Paradise to him who associates partners with Him. And Hell is his abode and the wrongdoers will not find any helpers."
The Table Spread,5,73,"Certainly, they (also) become disbelievers who say: ‘Allah is the third of the three (Gods),’ whereas there is none worthy of worship except the One God. If they do not desist from (the absurdity) which they utter, a grievous punishment will surely torment those of them who disbelieve."
The Table Spread,5,74,"Will they not turn towards Allah (in repentance) and beg forgiveness from Him? For Allah is Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful."
The Table Spread,5,75,"The Messiah, the son of Maryam (Mary), is (nothing) but a Messenger (neither a god nor a son of God nor His partner). Many Messengers have indeed preceded him, and his mother was a paragon of truth (a saintly person). Both (were mortal creatures as they) used to eat food. (O Beloved!) Observe how clearly We explain the Revelations for their (guidance), but again observe how (in spite of that) they are turning away (from the truth)!"
The Table Spread,5,76,"Say: ‘Do you worship besides Allah someone that has no power to do you any harm or good? Allah is the One Who is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.’"
The Table Spread,5,77,"Say: ‘O People of the Book! Do not unjustly exceed limits in your din (religion), nor follow the desires of those who lost the straight path (before Muhammad’s Prophethood [blessings and peace be upon him]) and (also) caused a number of (others) to go astray and remained deviated from the straight road (even after Muhammad’s Prophethood [blessings and peace be upon him]).’"
The Table Spread,5,78,"Those amongst the Children of Israel who disbelieved were cursed by the tongue of Dawud (David) and ‘Isa, the son of Maryam (Jesus, the son of Mary). That is because they disobeyed and transgressed."
The Table Spread,5,79,"(And they were also cursed because) they would not prevent one another from the evil deeds they used to do. Certainly, evil were the deeds they used to do."
The Table Spread,5,80,You will see most of them befriending the disbelievers. How evil that is which they have sent forward for their (accountability on the Last Day) and (that is) that Allah is (highly) displeased with them and they will suffer from the torment forever!
The Table Spread,5,81,"And had they believed in Allah and the (Last) Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) and the (Book) that has been revealed to him, they would not have made friends with those (enemies of Islam). But most of them are disobedient."
The Table Spread,5,82,"You will indeed find the Jews and the polytheists the bitterest of people in their enmity against the Muslims, and the closest in love and affection for the Muslims you will find those who say: ‘Indeed, we are Nazarenes (Christians).’ This is because amongst them are savants (i.e., scholars of Shariah) as well as monks (i.e., ascetic worshippers) and (moreover) they are not given to arrogance."
The Table Spread,5,83,"And (that is the reason) when (some of the true Christians) listen to this (Holy Qur’an) which has been revealed to the Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him), you see their eyes overflowing with tears. (This overflowing of tears) springs from the truth of which they have (gained) gnosis. (Besides) they submit: ‘O our Lord! We have believed (in the Truth which You have revealed), so inscribe us (also) amongst those who bear witness (to the truth)."
The Table Spread,5,84,"And what is the matter with us that we should not believe in Allah and the truth (i.e., Muhammad [blessings and peace be upon him] and the Holy Qur’an) which has come to us, whilst we (too) cherish (this) strong ambition that our Lord admit us (to His mercy and Paradise) along with the most pious?’"
The Table Spread,5,85,"So Allah rewarded them with Gardens, with streams flowing under them, in recompense of the submission they made (like a true believer. They) will live there forever, and that is the reward of the righteous."
The Table Spread,5,86,"But those who disbelieve and belie Our Revelations, it is they who are (the inmates) of Hell."
The Table Spread,5,87,"O believers! Do not make (for yourselves) unlawful those pure things which Allah has made lawful for you and do not exceed limits either. Indeed, Allah does not like those who transgress the prescribed bounds."
The Table Spread,5,88,And eat of the pure and lawful things Allah has provided for you and always fear Allah in Whom you believe.
The Table Spread,5,89,"Allah does not persecute you for your purposeless (and frivolous) oaths, but takes you to task for your (solemn) oaths which you affirm (deliberately). (If you breach such oaths) the atonement is feeding ten poor persons with an average (quality) food which you serve to your family, or providing them (the poor) with the clothes, or freeing one neck (i.e., a slave). But the one who does not find (all this) shall fast for three days. This is the atonement for your oaths which you affirm (and then break). So, always guard your oaths. It is this way Allah explains most clearly His Revelations to you so that you may become grateful (by obeying His commandments)."
The Table Spread,5,90,O believers! Wine and gambling and idols mounted (for worship) and divining arrows (for seeking luck—all) are filthy works of Satan. So turn away from them (completely) so that you may prosper.
The Table Spread,5,91,"Satan seeks only to breed enmity and spite amongst you by means of wine and gambling, and hinder you from remembering Allah and observing Prayer. Will you abstain (from these evil-generating temptations)?"
The Table Spread,5,92,"And obey Allah and obey the Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) and be on your guard (against opposition to Allah and the Messenger [blessings and peace be upon him]). But if you turn away, then you should know that the responsibility of Our Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) is only to deliver (the commandments) clearly (and he has accomplished this duty)."
The Table Spread,5,93,"There is no sin on those who believe and do righteous deeds with regard to what they have eaten (of the unlawful things before the prohibition came), whereas (in all other matters) they were Godwary and put firm faith (in other commandments of Allah), and practised pious deeds consistently. Later, (also after the revelation of the prohibitions,) they desisted from (all the unlawful things) and believed (true-heartedly in their unlawfulness), became men of piety and Godwariness, and (finally) rose to the station of men of spiritual excellence (i.e., Allah’s beloved, favourite, intimate and righteous servants). And Allah loves those who live with spiritual excellence."
The Table Spread,5,94,"O believers! Allah will certainly test you by means of (some) game animals your hands and your lances can reach so that Allah makes him identifiable who fears Him in secret. Then whoever transgresses (even) after that, for him is a painful chastisement."
The Table Spread,5,95,"O believers! Do not kill game whilst you are in pilgrim attire (ihram). Whoever of you (pilgrim-clad) kills it intentionally will recompense (it) in kind of cattle equivalent to the one he has killed. In this regard, two men of probity out of you are to judge (whether this animal is really the game’s equal, provided) that offering is to be brought to the Ka‘ba. Or its atonement is feeding a few indigent persons (i.e., usual food for the number of poor people manageable in the animal’s cost), or fasting corresponding to that (number of days manageable within the same food meant for the poor,) so that he tastes the (gravity) of his offence. Allah has forgiven whatever has gone by earlier (to it), but whoever repeats (a similar act) Allah will avenge (his defiance). And Allah is Mighty, the Lord of Retribution."
The Table Spread,5,96,"The game of the sea and its eating has been made lawful for your benefit and that of travellers, but the game of the land has been prohibited for you so long as you are in pilgrim dress (ihram). And always fear Allah towards Whose (presence) you (all) will be assembled."
The Table Spread,5,97,"Allah has made the Ka‘ba, the sacred (and venerable) House, a means to keep (peace in the spiritual and worldly matters of) the people. And also the Sacred Month and the animals of offerings to the Holy Ka‘ba and the animals with collars symbolic of sacrifice around their necks (brought into the sacred confines of Mecca, all have been granted sanctity and veneration by virtue of the same affinity); that is to make you know that Allah has the best knowledge of whatever there is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth, and Allah is Well Aware of everything."
The Table Spread,5,98,Know that Allah is Severe in punishment and that Allah is Most Forgiving and Ever-Merciful (as well).
The Table Spread,5,99,The Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) has (no other responsibility) but to communicate (the revealed commands with absolute perfection). And Allah knows (all) that you make known and that you hide.
The Table Spread,5,100,"Say: ‘(Both) the pure and the impure can never be alike, (O listener,) even though the abundance of the polluted and foul (objects) may fascinate you. So, (instead of observing the difference of abundance and scarcity) fear Allah, O men of wisdom, so that you may flourish and prosper.’"
The Table Spread,5,101,"O believers! Do not ask about things (on which the Qur’an is quiet,) for if they are disclosed to you, they may put you in strain (and you will be repelled by them). But if you enquire about them whilst the Qur’an is being sent down, they will be disclosed to you (i.e., fixated through revealing the commandments, but this will put an end to your choice of discretion, binding you to only one command). Allah has (so far) overlooked (these matters and questions), and Allah is Most Forgiving, Most Forbearing."
The Table Spread,5,102,"No doubt, a people before you asked about similar things, but (when they were disclosed to them) they denied them."
The Table Spread,5,103,"Allah has not made (lawful in the Shariah a cattle dedicated to idols), such as a Bahira, a Sa’iba, a Wasila or a Ham. But the disbelievers fabricate lies against Allah and most of them do not have sense."
The Table Spread,5,104,"And when it is said to them: ‘Turn towards this (Qur’an) revealed by Allah and towards the (most venerable) Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him),’ they say: ‘Sufficient for us is (the way) on which we found our fathers,’ though their fathers did not have any knowledge (of Din [Religion]), nor were they rightly guided."
The Table Spread,5,105,"O believers! Take care of your own selves. No one who goes astray can do you harm, provided you have become rightly guided. All of you have to return to Allah alone. He will then apprise you of (the works) that you used to do."
The Table Spread,5,106,"O believers! When death approaches any one of you, then at the time of making a bequest there should be two men of probity from amongst you (for) taking testimony, or (any) two men from amongst others if you are travelling in the land. If (in the meanwhile) the agony of death overtakes you, detain both of them after Prayer. If you suspect (them), they shall both swear by Allah: ‘We shall not sell it for any price, even though one is a (very close) relative, nor shall we conceal the testimony (ordained) by Allah. (If we hide it,) we shall be amongst sinners there and then.’"
The Table Spread,5,107,"But if it is learnt later that both of them have earned sin (owing to concealing the true witness), then, in their stead, two other (witnesses) should rise from amongst those whose right the two former (witnesses) have seized. (Let them both be closer relatives of the deceased.) They should then swear by Allah: ‘Indeed, our testimony is truer than the testimony of both of them; we are not transgressing the bounds (of Truth. If we do so,) we shall be amongst the wrongdoers there and then.’"
The Table Spread,5,108,"This (method) is closer to the mode of making people give their evidence true to the facts, or they feel afraid that (in the case of false testimony,) following their oaths, (equally solemn) oaths will be turned (towards closer heirs). So fear Allah with perseverance and always listen (attentively to the commandments of Allah). And Allah does not guide the people who disobey and defy."
The Table Spread,5,109,(Fear the Day) when Allah will assemble all the Messengers and ask (them): ‘What response were you served (by your respective Communities following your call for Din [Religion])?’ They will (submit their) reply (to their Lord): ‘We have no knowledge. It is certainly You Who know all the unseen full well.’
The Table Spread,5,110,"When Allah will say: ‘O ‘Isa, the son of Maryam (Jesus, the son of Mary), call to mind My favour to you and your mother when I provided you strength through the Holy Spirit (Gabriel); you conversed with the people (in a uniform style both) from the cradle (during early childhood) and in the ripe age (whilst preaching as a Messenger); and when I taught you the Book and wisdom (and insight) and the Torah and the Injil (the Gospel); and when by My command you made out of clay some (figure) looking like a bird, then you would breathe into it and by My command it would become a bird; and when you healed the blind and the leper (i.e., victims of leprosy) by My command; and when you raised up the dead (standing, bringing them back to life from the grave) by My command; and when I held back the Children of Israel from (killing) you whilst you brought them clear signs, those who disbelieved amongst them said: ‘This is nothing but sheer magic.’"
The Table Spread,5,111,"And when I imbued the hearts of the disciples with (this): ‘Believe in Me and My Messenger (‘Isa [Jesus]),’ they said: ‘We believe and bear witness that we are certainly Muslims.’"
The Table Spread,5,112,"And (also recall) when the disciples said: ‘‘Isa, the son of Maryam (Jesus, the son of Mary), is it possible for your Lord to send down to us from heaven a table (spread with food)?’ ‘Isa (Jesus) said (in reply): ‘(O people,) fear Allah if you are illumined with faith.’"
The Table Spread,5,113,They said: ‘We seek (only) to eat of it so that our hearts are satisfied and we know (with added certitude) that you have told us the truth and we bear witness (to the descent of the table).’
The Table Spread,5,114,"‘Isa, the son of Maryam (Jesus, the son of Mary) said: ‘O Allah, our Lord, send down to us from heaven the table spread (with bounties) so that (the day of its descent) becomes (‘Id) a festival day for us, and for our predecessors (as well as) successors, and that (spread table) comes as a sign from You, and provide us with sustenance, and You are the Best Sustainer.’"
The Table Spread,5,115,"Allah said: ‘I certainly send it down to you, but whoever of you disbelieves (after that), I shall punish him with a torment such as I will never inflict on anyone else in all the worlds.’"
The Table Spread,5,116,"And when Allah will say: ‘O ‘Isa, the son of Maryam (Jesus, the son of Mary)! Did you ask the people to take you and your mother as two gods besides Allah?’ He will submit: ‘Glory be to You! It is not (justified) for me to say such a thing as I have no right to say. Had I said it, You would surely have known it. You know every such (thing) that is in my heart, but I do not know those (things) which are in Your knowledge. Indeed, it is only You Who know well all that is unseen."
The Table Spread,5,117,"I said to them nothing except (that) which You ordered me to say: Worship (only) Allah, Who is my Lord and your Lord (too). And I kept a vigilant watch over (their beliefs and actions) so long as I was amongst them. But when You lifted me up, then You alone watched over their (affairs), and You are a Witness to everything."
The Table Spread,5,118,"If You torment them, they are only Your servants, and if You forgive them, You are indeed Almighty, All-Wise.’"
The Table Spread,5,119,Allah will say: ‘This is the Day (when) the truth of the truthful will benefit them. There are Gardens for them with streams flowing beneath; they will live therein forever. Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him. This (pleasure of Allah) is the highest achievement.’
The Table Spread,5,120,"To Allah belongs the kingdom of all the heavens and the earth and whatever lies in them, and He wields full power over everything."
Cattle,6,1,"All praise belongs to Allah alone, Who created the heavens and the earth and produced darkness and light; yet the disbelievers set up (false gods as) equals to their Lord."
Cattle,6,2,"(Allah) is He Who created you from mud (i.e., originated from it the chemical genesis of human life on the planet Earth). Then He fixed a term (for you to die). And with Him alone is the appointed time (for holding the Day of Resurrection); yet you doubt."
Cattle,6,3,And He alone is Allah (the True God to be worshipped) in the heavens and the earth Who knows (all) your hidden and your open (things). And He (also) knows that which you are earning.
Cattle,6,4,And there comes to them no sign of the signs of their Lord but (that) they turn away from it.
Cattle,6,5,Then indeed (the same way) they belied the truth (the Qur’an as well) when it came to them (as a sign of Allah). But soon there is coming to them the news pertaining to what they have been making fun of.
Cattle,6,6,"Have they not seen how many a generation We eliminated before them whom We had given (such an indomitable) dominion (and stronghold) in the land as We have not given even to you? And We sent upon them persistently falling rain, and caused streams to flow beneath (their dwellings and castles). Then, (despite giving them such a luxurious life,) We destroyed them because of their sins and raised other communities after them."
Cattle,6,7,"And had We revealed to you a book written on paper which these people could also have touched with their own hands, (even) then the disbelievers would have said: ‘This is (nothing) but sheer magic.’"
Cattle,6,8,"And these (disbelievers) say: ‘Why was an angel (whom we could physically see and who would verify him) not sent down to this (glorious Messenger)?’ Had We sent down an angel, (their) affair would have been settled once and for all, and they would not have been granted (any) respite."
Cattle,6,9,"And if We had made the Messenger an angel, even then We would have made him (the form of) a man, and (even in that case) We would have put them in the same doubt which they are (already) in (i.e., confused over his physical appearance, they would say: ‘He is a human being like us.’)"
Cattle,6,10,"And indeed, before you (too) the Messengers were laughed at, but then the same (torment of the truth) they ridiculed besieged those of them who ridiculed."
Cattle,6,11,Say: ‘Travel through the earth and see (with a warned eye) what has been the end of those who denied (the truth).’
Cattle,6,12,Ask (them this question): ‘To whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth?’ And (then) proclaim (this as well): ‘Allah’s it is.’ He has made mercy incumbent upon Himself (as a gracious obligation). He will gather you together on the Day of Resurrection in which there is no doubt. Those who have brought (eternal) loss upon their souls will not believe.
Cattle,6,13,"And to Him belongs (all the creation) that reposes at night and during the day. And He is All-Hearing, All-Knowing."
Cattle,6,14,"Say: ‘Shall I take (for worship) anyone as (my) friend other than Allah, Who is the Creator of the heavens and the earth, and He feeds (all) and is not fed (Himself)?’ Say: ‘I have been commanded to become the first Muslim (who bows his head before His Holy presence), and (this too has been commanded) never to be one of the polytheists.’"
Cattle,6,15,"Say: ‘Surely, I fear the Day of a mighty torment if I disobey my Lord. (So how is it possible?)’"
Cattle,6,16,He from whom that (torment) is averted on that Day shall have been shown great mercy (by Allah). And it is this (deliverance on the Last Day) which is an evident success.
Cattle,6,17,"And if Allah afflicts you with some suffering, there is none who can remove it but He, and if He bestows some good upon you, then He wields full power over everything."
Cattle,6,18,"And He is the One Who is Dominant over His servants and He is All-Wise, All-Knowing."
Cattle,6,19,"Inquire (of them): ‘Who is the greatest to bear testimony?’ Proclaim (yourself): ‘Allah is witness between you and me. This Qur’an has been revealed to me so that with it I may warn you as well as every such person this (Qur’an) may reach. Do you really bear witness that there are (also) gods other than Allah?’ Say: ‘I do not bear witness (to such a wrong thing).’ Reiterate: ‘God is but He, the Only One, and I despise (all) these objects you associate (with Allah).’"
Cattle,6,20,"Those to whom We have given the Book recognize this (Last of the Messengers) as they recognize their sons. They are those who have brought (eternal) loss upon their souls, but they will not believe."
Cattle,6,21,"And who can be a greater wrongdoer than one who invents a lie against Allah or who belies His Revelations? Surely, the wrongdoers will not prosper."
Cattle,6,22,And the Day when We shall assemble them all together and ask those who used to associate partners with Us: ‘Where are your partners you assumed (to be your gods)?’
Cattle,6,23,"Then they will be left with no other excuse except that they (will) say: ‘By Allah, our Lord, we did not associate partners with Allah.’"
Cattle,6,24,"See how they lie against their own selves, and the blame they used to fabricate (in the world) has vanished from them!"
Cattle,6,25,"And amongst them are (also) some who keep their ears towards you, and (in view of their evil intentions) We have wrapped their hearts in veils. (So, it is not possible for them now) that they may understand it (the Qur’an) and (We have) plugged their ears. And even if they see all signs (naked), they (still) will not believe in them, so much so that when they approach you and quarrel with you, the disbelievers say (at that time): ‘This (Qur’an) is nothing but fabricated stories of the old folk.’"
Cattle,6,26,"And they hinder (others from following) this (Messenger [blessings and peace be upon him] and the Qur’an) and (also themselves) flee far away from it. They ruin but their own souls, and have no awareness (of this destruction at all)."
Cattle,6,27,"If you see (them at the time) when they will be made to stand (on the verge of) the Fire, they will say: ‘Would that we were sent back (to the world), then we would not (at all) belie the signs of our Lord and would be of the believers!’"
Cattle,6,28,"(This affirmation contains no truth.) In fact, whatever they used to hide before (all that) has become visible to them. And (even) if they were sent back (to the world), they would (once again) do the same that they had been forbidden. And undoubtedly, they are (seasoned) liars."
Cattle,6,29,"And they will keep saying (what they said before): ‘There is no other (life) except the life of this world, nor shall we be raised up (after death).’"
Cattle,6,30,"If you see (them at the time) when they will be made to stand before their Lord and Allah will say (to them): ‘Is this (life) not a truth?’ They will submit: ‘Yes, of course, by our Lord (it is the truth).’ Allah will (then) say: ‘So (now) taste the torment because you used to disbelieve.’"
Cattle,6,31,"So those who belie their meeting with Allah incur loss, so much so that when the Last Hour comes upon them all of a sudden, they will say: ‘Oh, woe to us! We committed a (serious) blunder with regard to (believing in) this (Day of Resurrection).’ And they will be carrying the burdens (of their sins) on their backs. Beware! Most evil is that burden which they are bearing."
Cattle,6,32,"And (the luxury of) the worldly life is nothing but play and funfair, and certainly, it is the home of the Hereafter which is better for the Godfearing. Do you not understand (this reality)?"
Cattle,6,33,"(O Beloved!) We assuredly know that (what) they say grieves you. So they are not denying you, but (in fact) it is the Revelations of Allah that the wrongdoers are denying."
Cattle,6,34,"And indeed, (many) Messengers were rejected before you (as well), but they remained steadfast facing this rejection and persecution until Our help reached them. And there is none that can alter the Words (i.e., promises) of Allah. And surely the accounts of the Messengers have come to you (for peace of heart)."
Cattle,6,35,"And if their disinclination and turning away is distressing you (and you ardently desire them to believe in any case), then, if possible, manage a tunnel, (going down) into the earth, or seek some ladder, (climbing up) to heaven, and bring them some (exceptional) sign (to show them, even then they will not believe). And if Allah so willed, He would indeed assemble them together on guidance. So (owing to the overwhelming enthusiasm generating from your compassion, kindness and concern) do not be unaware (of their ill fortune)."
Cattle,6,36,The truth is that they alone who listen to it (with truthful hearts) accept (the invitation of truth). And Allah will raise the dead (the deniers of the truth from the graves as disbelievers). Then they will be returned to the same (Lord that they used to deny).
Cattle,6,37,"And they said: ‘Why has a (permanent) sign not been sent down to this (Messenger [blessings and peace be upon him]) from his Lord?’ Say: ‘Allah assuredly has the power to send down (such a) sign, but most of them do not know (the secrets of His wisdom).’"
Cattle,6,38,"And, (O mankind,) there is no moving (animal) on the earth nor a bird that flies on its two wings but (such) that they are species like you (umamun amthalu-kum—in several traits). We have not omitted anything (which is not given symbolic or elaborate details) in the Book. Then all (the people) will be gathered before their Lord."
Cattle,6,39,"And those who reject Our Revelations are deaf and dumb, (groping) in the folds of darkness. Allah holds astray whom He wills (due to his stubbornness and the denial of the truth), and puts whom He pleases on the straight road (due to the acceptance of the truth)."
Cattle,6,40,"Say (to these disbelievers): ‘Give your view: if Allah’s torment befalls you, or the Last Hour comes upon you, will you then call upon anyone other than Allah (to escape the torment? Reply) if you are truthful.’"
Cattle,6,41,"(Nay, that is not possible at all.) The truth is that it is (Allah) Whom you call upon (even now). Then, if He wills, He averts those (hardships) for which you call upon (Him). (At that time) you forget those (idols) that you associate as partners (with Allah)."
Cattle,6,42,"Indeed, We sent Messengers to many communities before you. Then We seized them with scarcity and distress (due to their disobedience and defiance), so that they might beseech (with submissiveness and humility)."
Cattle,6,43,"Then why did they not humble themselves and wail and moan when Our torment came upon them? But (the fact is that) their hearts became hardened, and Satan made those (sinful) acts that they used to perpetrate appear to them attractive and alluring."
Cattle,6,44,"But when they forgot that Reminder which was urged upon them, We opened up for them the gates (to abundance) of everything (to take them to their end) until when they luxuriated (in ecstasy of sensual delights and sensuous gratification) with all that was provided for them, We seized them all of a sudden (with torment) and they were struck with despair."
Cattle,6,45,"So the root of the wrongdoing and unjust people was cut off. And all praise belongs to Allah alone, Who is the Sustainer of all the worlds."
Cattle,6,46,"Say (to them): ‘What do you think if Allah deprives you of hearing and sight and seals up your hearts, (then) who is the god other than Allah who can restore to you these (blessings afresh)?’ Look how diversely We explain Our Revelations! Yet they continue turning away."
Cattle,6,47,"(Also) say (to them): ‘Tell me if the punishment of Allah comes upon you all of a sudden or openly, will (any other) be destroyed except those who do injustice?’"
Cattle,6,48,"And We do not send Messengers but as Bearers of glad tidings and as Warners. So whoever believes and changes into a righteous person (practically), they will have nothing to fear, nor will they grieve."
Cattle,6,49,"But those who belie Our Revelations, torment is bound to befall them because they used to disobey."
Cattle,6,50,"Say (to these disbelievers): ‘I do not say to you that I possess the treasures of Allah, nor do I know the unseen myself, nor do I say to you that I am an angel. I follow only that (commandment) which is revealed to me.’ Say: ‘Can the blind and the seeing be equal? So do you not ponder?’"
Cattle,6,51,And warn by means of this (Qur’an) those who fear that they will be assembled before their Lord whilst they are without (any) helper or intercessor apart from Him so that they may become pious.
Cattle,6,52,"And do not turn away these (run-down and broken-hearted) people (from your company and close circle) who call upon their Lord persistently, seeking only His pleasure morning and evening. There is nothing (obligatory) either on you from their account (of deeds and rewards) or upon them from your account. Even then if you turned them away (from your munificence and benevolence), you would be of those who deprive others of their rights (which does not go with your glory)."
Cattle,6,53,"And in this way, We put to the test some of them by means of some others so that these (affluent disbelievers seeing the poor Muslims) say (mockingly): ‘Are these the ones from amongst us upon whom Allah has bestowed His favours?’ Does Allah not know best the grateful?"
Cattle,6,54,"And when those who believe in Our Revelations come to you, then say (affectionately): ‘Peace be upon you!’ Your Lord has made mercy incumbent upon Himself (as a gracious obligation). So whoever from amongst you commits some evil out of ignorance (or suspension of discretion) but later turns to (Allah in) repentance and amends (himself), then surely He is Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful."
Cattle,6,55,"And so do We elucidate in detail the Revelations, (and this is) in order that the pattern of behaviour of the evildoers may become distinctly known (to all)."
Cattle,6,56,"Say: ‘I am forbidden to worship those (false gods) that you worship apart from Allah.’ Say: ‘I cannot follow your desires, for if I did, I would certainly lose the right path; nor would I be one of the rightly guided (which is impossible).’"
Cattle,6,57,"Say: ‘(O disbelievers!) Verily, I stand (firm) on the enlightening proof from my Lord and you treat it as false. I do not have that (chastisement) which you seek in haste. The command rests only with Allah. He relates the truth and He is the Best Judge.’"
Cattle,6,58,"Say (to them): ‘Had I had that (torment) which you desire to have in haste, then certainly the matter between me and you would have been settled once and for all. And Allah knows the unjust full well.’"
Cattle,6,59,"With Him (under His control and possession) are the keys of the unseen (i.e., the ways and means by which the unseen is disclosed to someone); no one (by one’s own effort) knows them but He. And He knows (directly) whatever is in the land and in the sea. And not a leaf falls but He knows it. There is not a grain in the folds of the earth’s darkness, nor anything green or dry but (has been recorded) in the enlightening Book."
Cattle,6,60,"And He is the One Who takes your souls by night and knows whatever you earn by day, and then wakes you up in the day, so that the appointed term (of your life) may be completed. Then to Him will you return. Then (on the Day of Reckoning) He will unfold to you (all those actions) which you used to do (during this term of life)."
Cattle,6,61,"And He has dominance over His servants, and He sends to you (angels as) guardians until when death approaches any of you, (then the angels) We send take his soul and they do not err (or default)."
Cattle,6,62,"Then they will (all) be returned to the presence of Allah, their true Lord. Beware! It is only His (prerogative) to decree. And He is the Quickest in taking account."
Cattle,6,63,"Inquire of them: ‘Who delivers you from the layers of the darkness of the land and the sea? When (in trouble) you supplicate Him, totally prostrated and (also) in secret: ‘If He delivers us from that (adversity), we shall surely be amongst the grateful.’"
Cattle,6,64,"Say: ‘It is Allah Who rescues you from this (adversity) and every other distress, yet you associate partners with Him.’"
Cattle,6,65,"Say: ‘He has the power to send you the torment (whether) from above you or from underneath your feet, or engage you in strife by splitting you into sects and making you taste the violence of one against the other.’ See in what diverse ways We elucidate the Revelations, so that they may comprehend."
Cattle,6,66,"And your people have rejected this (Qur’an) as false, whereas it is the absolute truth. Say: ‘I am not a guardian over you.’"
Cattle,6,67,Every news has a fixed time (to occur) and soon will you come to know.
Cattle,6,68,"When you see those who engage themselves in (vain discourse and making a jest of) Our Revelations, keep away from them till they get busy with some other subject of conversation. But if Satan makes you forget (it), then never (ever) sit with the unjust people after it strikes your mind."
Cattle,6,69,"And there is nothing (obligatory) upon the Godfearing from the account of these (disbelievers), but they (should) admonish them so that they may be protected (from disbelief and mocking the Qur’an)."
Cattle,6,70,"And let them be forsaken who have made their own din (religion) a sport and pastime and who have been deceived by the worldly life. And continue to exhort them (for their awareness) by means of the (Qur’an), so that no soul gets consigned to ruin as a result of its doings. (Then) there will be neither any helper nor any intercessor for him apart from Allah. And even if that (soul) atones (for its sins) full recompense (i.e., ransom), that will not be accepted from it (at all). It is they who are destroyed in consequence of their doings. For them is drinking of scalding water and a torturous torment because they used to reject faith."
Cattle,6,71,"Say: ‘Should we worship besides Allah something that can neither bring us any profit nor do us any harm, and turn on our heels after Allah has blessed us with guidance, like the one whom the satans have persuaded away from the right path into bewilderment in the land, whose companions are calling on him to the straight path: Come to us (but he can perceive nothing)?’ Proclaim: ‘The guidance of Allah is the only (true) guidance, and (that is why) we have been commanded to submit totally to the Lord of all the worlds.’"
Cattle,6,72,"And this (has also been commanded:) ‘Establish Prayer and always fear Him, and Allah is He to Whom you (all) will be gathered.’"
Cattle,6,73,"And He is the One (Allah) Who has created the heavens and the earth (in accordance with His decreed celestial order based) on truth. And the Day when He will say: ‘Be,’ then that (Day of Judgment) will come into being. His Word is the truth. And His will be the sovereignty on the Day when the Trumpet will be blown (by Israfil). He (is the One Who) has the knowledge of the unseen and the seen, and He is All-Wise, All-Aware."
Cattle,6,74,"And recall when Ibrahim (Abraham) said to his father Azar (he was in fact his paternal uncle and is called father according to Arabic usage): ‘Do you take the idols as gods? Indeed, I find you and your people (engaged) in manifest error.’"
Cattle,6,75,"And in the same way, We showed Ibrahim (Abraham) all the kingdoms of the heavens and the earth (i.e., the wonders of Our creation) so that he might be one of those who possess the eye of certitude."
Cattle,6,76,"So when the night spread its darkness over him, he beheld a star and said: ‘Is this my Lord (according to your view)?’ But when it set, he said (communicating to his people): ‘I do not like the setting ones.’"
Cattle,6,77,"Then when he saw the moon shining, he asked: ‘Is this my Lord (according to your view)?’ But when that (also) went down, he said (communicating to his people): ‘Had my Lord not guided me, I would surely have become (like you) one of those who go astray.’"
Cattle,6,78,"Then when he saw the sun shining, he said: ‘Is it my Lord (in your view because) this is the biggest?’ But when that (too) set, he exclaimed: ‘O people! I dissociate myself from (all) those (objects) that you associate (with Allah) as His partners."
Cattle,6,79,"I have indeed turned my face single-mindedly (from all sides) towards that (Being) Who has created the heavens and the earth beyond compare and (beware, for) I am not from amongst the polytheists.’"
Cattle,6,80,"And his people started disputing and contending with him. (Then) he said: ‘Do you dispute with me about Allah, Who has in fact guided me aright? And I fear not these (false gods) that you associate with Him except that whatever (harm) my Lord may will (He can do). My Lord has encompassed everything with (His) knowledge. So, do you not accept admonition?"
Cattle,6,81,And how should I fear these (false gods) that you associate as partners (with Allah) whilst you do not fear that you have set up (idols as) peers to Allah (whereas) He has not sent down to you any authority (to associate? Now reply yourselves:) Which of the two parties then has greater right to be free from the fear (of chastisement) if you have knowledge?’
Cattle,6,82,"Those who believe and do not mix up their belief with injustice (of polytheism), it is they who are entitled to peace (i.e., fearlessness in the Hereafter), and it is they who are blessed with guidance."
Cattle,6,83,"And this was Our proof (of the Oneness of Allah) that We imparted to Ibrahim (Abraham) against a people (hostile to him). We exalt to higher ranks whom We please. Surely, your Lord is Most Wise, All-Knowing."
Cattle,6,84,"And We bestowed upon him (Ibrahim [Abraham]) Ishaq (Isaac) and Ya‘qub (Jacob—son and grandson) and blessed all (of them) with guidance. (Also) before (them), We provided guidance to Nuh (Noah) and (guided aright) amongst his progeny Dawud (David), Sulayman (Solomon) and Ayyub (Job) and Yusuf (Joseph) and Musa (Moses) and Harun (Aaron). And thus do We reward the pious."
Cattle,6,85,"And (We guided also) Zakariyya (Zacharias), Yahya (John) and ‘Isa (Jesus) and Ilyas (Elias). All these were the righteous people (blessed with His nearness and divine consciousness)."
Cattle,6,86,"And (We guided) Isma‘il (Ishmael), al-Yasa‘ (Elisha) and Yunus (Jonah) and Lut (Lot, too). And We exalted all of them above all the people (of their time)."
Cattle,6,87,And also of their ancestors and descendants and their brothers (We honoured some with similar excellence) and We chose them (for Our special favour and eminence) and guided them to the straight road.
Cattle,6,88,"This is the guidance of Allah whereby He guides those of His servants whom He wills. But, if (supposedly) they had associated partners with Allah, all their (pious) deeds that they performed would have been seized (i.e., become void)."
Cattle,6,89,"(It is) they whom We gave the Book and the Authority of Judgement (Shariah) and Prophethood. Then if these people (the disbelievers) deny these things, We have indeed appointed such people (to believe in these things) as (will) never deny them."
Cattle,6,90,"It is (these) people (the Messengers of Allah) whom Allah has granted guidance. So, (O Last of the Messengers,) put into your practice all their (exalted and superior) ways and methods (and assimilate them into your holy personage so that all the superior traits and sublime attributes of all the Messengers of Allah collect in you). Say: ‘(O people,) I do not ask you for any wages (for this provision of guidance); it is but an admonition for mankind.’"
Cattle,6,91,"And they (the Jews) did not appreciate Allah with the just estimation that is His true measure (when they denied the Prophethood of Muhammad [blessings and peace be upon him]) saying: ‘Allah has not sent down anything to any human being.’ Say: ‘Who sent down the Book which Musa (Moses) brought, a light and guidance for the people? You have made them into separate sheets of paper showing it (to the people) and (also) concealing much (of it). And you have been taught what neither you nor your forefathers knew.’ Say: ‘(All this is but the blessing of) Allah.’ Then leave them (in whatever plight they are) sporting with their falsehood."
Cattle,6,92,"And this is (that) Book which We have sent down, the most blessed one. It (authentically) confirms those revealed Books that preceded it. And (this) has been (sent down) in order that (firstly) you warn the residents of the nucleus of all the (human) communities, Mecca, and (secondly) the dwellers around it (the world over). And only those who believe in it have faith in the Last Day, and they alone keep a vigilant watch over their Prayers."
Cattle,6,93,"And who is more unjust than one who invents a lie against Allah (and making a false claim of Prophethood) says: ‘Revelation has been sent down to me,’ whereas no revelation is sent to him? And who can be more unjust than one who (making a false claim of being a god) says: ‘I (too) shall soon send down such (a Book) as Allah has sent’? And if you visualize (the sight) when the unjust will be (suffering from) the death throes, and the angels will stretch forth their hands (towards them demanding:) ‘Deliver your souls from your bodies. This Day you will be recompensed with humiliating torment because you used to speak falsehood against Allah and disobey and disregard His Revelations.’"
Cattle,6,94,"And verily, (on the Day of Resurrection) you will come to Us all alone as We created you (all alone) the first time, and you will leave all that behind you which We have bestowed on you (of wealth and children). And We shall not see your intercessors accompanying you whom you have assumed to be Our partners in your affairs. Surely, (Today) your mutual relation (and confidence) has broken off, and (all) the claims that you used to make have become void."
Cattle,6,95,"Verily, Allah alone causes the seed-grain and the fruit-stone to burst forth and sprout. He brings forth the living from the dead and the dead from the living. Such is Allah (the Glorious); then where do you stray away?"
Cattle,6,96,"He is the One Who cleaves through the dark of the night, and causes the (light of) the day to burst forth. And He is the One Who has made the night for rest and the sun and the moon for reckoning and computing. This is the appointed measure of the Almighty, the All-Knowing (Lord)."
Cattle,6,97,"And He is the One Who has made for you stars so that you may navigate through all kinds of darkness of the land and the sea. Indeed, We have elucidated (Our) Revelations in detail for those who possess knowledge."
Cattle,6,98,"And (Allah) is He Who has created you from a single soul (i.e., a single cell). Then (for you) there (is) a place of residing and a place of storage (i.e., the mother’s womb and the world, or the world and the grave respectively). Surely, We have explained the signs (of Our Power and Might) in detail for the people who understand."
Cattle,6,99,"And He is the One Who sends down water from the sky. Then by means of this (rain), We bring forth vegetation of every kind out of which We produce green (foliage) from which We bring forth clustered grain packed one over the other, clusters of date-palm hanging low from its spathe, and gardens of grapes, olives and (also) pomegranates (which from many aspects look) alike but (in products, tastes and effects) are unlike. Look at the fruit of the tree when it bears fruit, and (also observe) when it ripens. Verily, in these are signs for those who believe."
Cattle,6,100,"And these (disbelievers) associate jinn as partners with Allah, whereas He is the One Who has created them. And (also) without knowledge (and reason), they falsely attribute sons and daughters to Allah. Holy is He and far Exalted above (all) that they attribute (to Him)."
Cattle,6,101,"He is the One Who is the Originator of the heavens and the earth. How can He have children when He has no wife? And He is the One Who has created everything, and He has the best knowledge of everything."
Cattle,6,102,"That is (Allah) your Sustainer; none has the right to be worshipped except He. (He is) the Creator of everything. So worship Him alone, and He is the Protector of everything."
Cattle,6,103,"No vision can grasp His Sight, but He has encompassed all vision and eyesight. And He is the All-Penetrating Viewer, All-Aware."
Cattle,6,104,"The signs (of guidance) have indeed come to you from your Lord. So he who perceives (them by his insight) brings (benefit) to his own self, and he who remains blind (also) brings loss upon his own self. And I am not a guardian over you."
Cattle,6,105,"And it is this way We elucidate (Our) Verses repeatedly (diversifying the styles) so that they (the disbelievers) may exclaim: ‘You have studied (from somewhere),’ and that We make it clear to the people who are prone to learn."
Cattle,6,106,"Follow this (Qur’an) which has been revealed to you from your Lord. There is no God except Allah, and turn away from those who associate partners with Allah."
Cattle,6,107,"And if Allah had willed (to prevent them forcefully), these people would (never) have set up partners with Him. And We have (also) not made you a guardian over them, nor are you a protector over them."
Cattle,6,108,"And, (O Muslims,) do not abuse these (false gods) that these (polytheists) worship besides Allah, lest these people should (also, in retaliation,) revile against Allah’s Glory wrongfully due to ignorance. Thus have We made the conduct of every sect (and faction) seem attractive to (their own eyes and they regard only that as truth). Then all have to return to their Lord, and He will inform them of (the results of) their deeds which they used to do."
Cattle,6,109,"They swear their most solemn oaths by Allah that if there comes to them some (manifest) sign, they shall certainly believe in that. Say (to them): ‘Signs are but with Allah alone. And, (O Muslims,) you are not aware that when the sign comes, they will (still) not believe.’"
Cattle,6,110,"And (due to their own malice) We shall turn their hearts and their eyes away from (accepting the truth the same way) as they have disbelieved (in the Messenger [blessings and peace be upon him]) the first time. (So, they will not believe even on seeing the sign). And We shall leave them to wander astray in their rebellion and defiance."
Cattle,6,111,"And if We sent down to them angels, and the dead started talking to them, and We gathered everything in clusters (before their eyes), even then they would not believe except what Allah willed, and most of them put ignorance to work."
Cattle,6,112,"And the same way We made for every Prophet enemies—the satans from amongst men and jinn—who always pour into one another’s hearts (flattery and) gilded talk (as suspicions) in order to deceive. And if your Lord had willed (to prevent them forcefully), they would not have done so. So leave them and (also) the falsehood which they fabricate."
Cattle,6,113,"And (its) purpose is that the hearts of the people who do not believe in the Hereafter may incline to this (deceit), and that they may develop fondness for it, and (also) that they may begin to do (the evil deeds) which they are themselves (perpetrating)."
Cattle,6,114,"(Say:) ‘Should I look for someone other than Allah as authority (and judge), whilst He (Allah) is the One Who has revealed to you the elaborate Book (comprising a clear course of action)?’ And those whom We gave the Book (before) know (with conviction) that this (Qur’an) has been revealed from your Lord (based on) truth. So do not be of the sceptics (with regard to these People of the Book whether or not they know that the Qur’an is a revealed Book)."
Cattle,6,115,"And the Word of your Lord has been perfected in truthfulness and justice. There is no one who can change His Words. And He is All-Hearing, All-Knowing."
Cattle,6,116,"And if you obeyed what the majority of people (dwelling) on earth say, they would lead you astray from the path of Allah. They simply follow assumptions and speculations (instead of truth and certitude) and remain engaged in mere guesswork (and telling lies)."
Cattle,6,117,"Surely, your Lord alone knows best the one who strays away from His path, and only He knows best the rightly guided (as well)."
Cattle,6,118,So always eat of that (slaughtered animal) over which the Name of Allah has been pronounced (at the time of slaughter) if you believe in His Revelations.
Cattle,6,119,"And what is the matter with you that you do not eat of that (meat) over which the Name of Allah has been pronounced (at the time of slaughter? You regard these lawful animals as unlawful without any reason), whilst He has spelled out to you in detail (all) those things which He has forbidden to you except when (under the unavoidable circumstances) you are forced (to eat the bare necessity just as a life-saving measure. So do not declare more things forbidden on your own anymore). Surely, many a people, devoid of (concrete) learning, lead (others) astray consistently by means of their own lusts (and fantasies). And surely, your Lord knows well the transgressors."
Cattle,6,120,"And give up all the sins of body and of heart (i.e., both open and secret). Indeed, those who are earning sins will soon be punished for (the evil works) that they used to perpetrate."
Cattle,6,121,"And do not eat of (the meat of the animal) over which the Name of Allah has not been pronounced (at the time of slaughter). Verily, it is a sin (to eat that meat). And surely, the devils keep pouring (doubts) into the hearts of their companions so that they may dispute with you. And if you follow their instructions, (then) you will also become polytheists."
Cattle,6,122,"Can he who was dead (i.e., devoid of faith), then We gave him life (by guidance) and created for him the light (of faith and gnosis), and (now) by means of that, he walks amongst (the rest of) the people (also to spread that light) be like the one who is steeped in the darkness of (ignorance and error in such a way) that he can by no means come out of it? Likewise, the actions disbelievers keep doing are made alluring and attractive (in their sight)."
Cattle,6,123,"And in like manner, We made the lords (and the affluent) in every community the ringleaders of their crimes, so that they might execute frauds in that (town), and (in fact) they do not defraud anyone other than their own selves. And they are not aware (of its evil outcome)."
Cattle,6,124,"And when a sign comes to them, they say: ‘We shall never believe until we too are given (a sign) like the one bestowed upon the Messengers of Allah.’ Allah knows best whom He is to assign the station of His Messengership. Soon the criminals will face humiliation before Allah, and (will undergo) a severe torment as well because they used to defraud (and deceive)."
Cattle,6,125,"So he whom Allah intends to give guidance (by way of bounty), He broadens his breast for Islam, and he for whom He wills persistence in error (which he has purchased) He, (by way of justice,) tightens his breast with (such a) fierce constriction as if he were ascending up hard into the sky (i.e., height). In the same way, Allah sends the torment (of disgrace) upon those who do not come to believe."
Cattle,6,126,"And this (Islam) is the (only) straight path of your Lord. Verily, We have clearly explained Revelations in detail for those who accept direction and guidance."
Cattle,6,127,For them is the home of peace and security with their Lord. And He is the One Who is their Protector because of the (pious) deeds which they used to do.
Cattle,6,128,"And on the Day when He gathers them all together (He will say:) ‘O party of jinn (satans), certainly you misguided many a human being,’ and their friends amongst mankind will say: ‘O our Lord! We have (sufficiently) benefited from each other, and (in the same state of negligence and interest-mongering) reached the end of the term that You had fixed for us (but we could not make any preparation for this).’ Allah will say: ‘(Now) the Fire is your abode in which you will reside forever, except what Allah may will. Verily, your Lord is Most Wise, All-Knowing.’"
Cattle,6,129,"And in this manner, We continue making some of the oppressors dominate over others due to the (evil) deeds that they earn."
Cattle,6,130,"O community of jinn and men! Did Messengers not come to you from amongst yourselves reciting My Verses to you, and warning you of your appearance (before Me) this Day? They will say: ‘We bear witness against our own souls.’ The life of the world had caught them in deception, and they will bear witness (to this effect) against themselves that (in the world) they were disbelievers (i.e., the beliers of the truth)."
Cattle,6,131,"This (sending of the Messengers) was because your Lord would not destroy the towns due to injustice whilst the people living there were (absolutely) unaware (of the teachings of the truth, i.e., no one made them acquainted with the truth)."
Cattle,6,132,"And there are ranks (determined) for all according to their works, and your Lord is not unaware (of the works) they do."
Cattle,6,133,"And your Lord is Self-Sufficient, Lord of (great) mercy. If He wills, He can eliminate you and, after you, make your successor whom He likes as He has raised you from the descendants of another people."
Cattle,6,134,"Indeed, (the torment) which you are being promised has to certainly come and you cannot thwart (Allah)."
Cattle,6,135,"Say: ‘O (my) people! Keep working at your position and surely I continue working (at my place). Then you shall soon come to know for whom it ends (well) in the Hereafter. Indeed, the unjust will not be emancipated.’"
Cattle,6,136,"They have fixed for Allah a share of the same (things) that He has produced of crops and cattle. Then, out of their (false) speculation, they say: ‘This share is for Allah and that for our (so-called) partners.’ Then (the share) meant for their partners does not reach Allah, and that (portion) which is for Allah reaches their partners. What an evil judgment (they) are making!"
Cattle,6,137,"And in like manner, their partners have made the killing of their children appear attractive to many of the idolaters in order to ruin them, and (also) make their (leftover) religion doubtful for them. And had Allah willed (to prevent them forcefully), they could not have done it. So leave them alone (paying no heed to them) and that which they fabricate."
Cattle,6,138,"And, according to their (heretic) concept, they (also) say: ‘These (particular) cattle and crops are prohibited. None can eat them except the one whom we wish. (And) there are (certain) cattle whose backs are forbidden (to ride). And there are (some) cattle on which these people do not pronounce the Name of Allah (at the time of slaughter. All this) amounts to fabrication against Allah.’ Soon He will punish them for (that) which they used to fabricate."
Cattle,6,139,"And they (also) say: ‘The (offspring) in the wombs of these cattle is exclusively for our men but forbidden to our women, and if that (offspring) is stillborn, then they (men and women) all are partners in it.’ Soon He will punish them for their (invented) dogmas. He is indeed Most Wise, All-Knowing."
Cattle,6,140,"Certainly, ruined are they who kill their children without (true) knowledge out of (sheer) foolishness, and make those (things) unlawful which Allah has bestowed upon them (as sustenance), inventing a lie against Allah. They have certainly lost the straight path and could not be rightly guided."
Cattle,6,141,"And He is the One Who has produced trellised and untrellised gardens (i.e., plants climbing up with supports and those not climbing up) and (also created) date (palms) and vegetation with a wide variety of fruits and olive and pomegranates (that) resemble (in shape) but differ (in taste). When (these trees) bear fruit, eat of their fruits, and (also) give away its due (as appointed by Allah) on the day of harvest (of the crop and the fruit), and do not spend wastefully. Surely, He does not like those who spend extravagantly."
Cattle,6,142,"And (He) has created (large) cattle to carry burden, and the ones lying-on-earth (due to short height or for slaughter). Eat of this (provision also by way of slaughter) which Allah has provided for you. And do not follow in the footsteps of Satan; certainly, he is your open enemy."
Cattle,6,143,(Allah) has created eight pairs: two of the sheep (male and female) and two of the goat (male and female). Say (to them): ‘Has He forbidden the two males or the two females or that (offspring) which is in the wombs of the two females? Answer me on the basis of knowledge and reason if you are truthful.’
Cattle,6,144,"And two of the camel (male and female) and two of the cow (male and female). Say (to them): ‘Has He forbidden the two males or the two females or that (offspring) which is in the wombs of the two females? Were you present when Allah pronounced to you this (prohibitive) injunction?’ Then who can be more unjust than the one who fabricates a lie against Allah so that he may lead the people astray without knowledge? Indeed, Allah does not guide the unjust people."
Cattle,6,145,"Say: ‘I do not find in that Revelation which has been sent to me anything forbidden to anyone who eats (such things) as he takes in food except carrion, or flowing blood, or the flesh of swine, for it is filthy and impious, or the sinfully slaughtered animal on which some name other than Allah’s Name has been invoked at the time of slaughter. But he who becomes helpless (due to hunger), and is neither disobeying nor transgressing, then surely your Lord is Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful.’"
Cattle,6,146,"And We forbade the Jews every (beast) having claws, and We forbade them the fat of the cow and the goat, except that (fat) which coats their backs or lines their entrails, or which is attached to the bones. This We awarded them as a punishment for their rebellion. And assuredly, We are Truthful."
Cattle,6,147,"Should they belie you, then say: ‘Your Lord is the Lord of infinite mercy, but His torment will not be averted from the evildoers.’"
Cattle,6,148,"Those who associate partners with Allah will soon say: ‘Had Allah so willed, neither we nor our fathers would have committed polytheism; nor would we have declared anything forbidden (without authority).’ In like manner, the people before them also belied until they tasted Our torment. Say: ‘Do you have any (authentic) knowledge which you may bring forth for us? (If so, then present it).’ You (abandoning knowledge of certitude) follow only assumptions and speculations and tell sheer lies (based on guesswork).’"
Cattle,6,149,"Say: ‘Only Allah’s is the irrefutable proof. So, if He had willed (to force you), He would have made all of you guidance-bound.’*"
Cattle,6,150,"Say (to these polytheists): ‘Produce your witnesses who would (come to) testify that Allah has forbidden this.’ Then if at all they bear (false) witness, do not accept their testimony (but instead disclose to them their falsehood). Nor yield to the vain desires of those who refuse to accept Our Revelations as true and do not believe in the Hereafter and hold (false gods as) equal to their Lord."
Cattle,6,151,"Say: ‘Come, I will recite to you those things which your Lord has forbidden to you: Do not set up anything as a partner with Him; be morally excellent with parents; and do not kill your children owing to poverty. We alone give you sustenance and (will provide for) them as well. And do not draw near to shameful deeds (whether) open or hidden. And do not kill the soul whose (killing) Allah has forbidden, except when it is rightfully due (according to law in self-defence against disruption and whilst combating terrorism). It is these (injunctions) He has enjoined upon you so that you may apply reason."
Cattle,6,152,"And do not go near the property of the orphan but in the most likable manner until he reaches the age of maturity.’ And always give full measure and weight with justice. We do not burden any soul beyond its ability to bear it. And when you say (something pertaining to somebody), do justice even though he is (your) near relative. And always fulfil the promise of Allah. These are (the matters) which He has strictly ordained for you in order that you may accept direction and guidance."
Cattle,6,153,"And that this (Islamic law) is My straight path. So follow it and do not follow (other) paths, because they (the other paths) will move you away from Allah’s path. This is what He has enjoined you strictly so that you may become Godfearing."
Cattle,6,154,"Then We gave Musa (Moses) the Book to complete (the favour) on him who would become pious, and (revealed it) as explanation of everything and as guidance and mercy, so that they might believe in meeting with their Lord (on the Day of Resurrection)."
Cattle,6,155,And this (Qur’an) is a Book which We have revealed full of blessings. So (now) follow it and fear (Allah) persistently so that you are shown mercy.
Cattle,6,156,"(The Qur’an has been revealed lest) you (should) say: ‘The (heavenly) Book was only sent down before us to the two communities (the Jews and the Christians), and undoubtedly, we were unaware of their reading and teaching.’"
Cattle,6,157,"Or (lest) you should say: ‘Had the Book been sent down to us, we would certainly have been better guided than they are.’ So, now has come to you from your Lord the clear proof and guidance and mercy. Then who can be more unjust than he who treats the Revelations of Allah as lies and evades them? Soon shall We inflict an evil torment upon those who evade Our Revelations because they used to turn away (from the signs of Allah)."
Cattle,6,158,"They are just waiting for the angels (of torment) to reach them, or your Lord to come (Himself), or some (exclusive) signs of your Lord to come (perceptibly. Tell them:) ‘The Day when some signs of your Lord will come (in such an evident way, then accepting) the belief will not benefit someone who had not believed before, or did not earn any good (in the state of) having believed.’ Say: ‘Wait; we (too) are waiting.’"
Cattle,6,159,"Surely, those who have broken up their religion (by introducing segregated paths) and have divided into (different) sects, you are not (concerned with or responsible for) them in any matter. Their case is only with Allah. Then He would let them know what they used to do."
Cattle,6,160,"Whoever brings one good deed will have to his credit (as a reward) ten more like it, and whoever brings an evil deed will not be punished for more than one similar (evil deed). And no injustice will be done to them."
Cattle,6,161,"Say: ‘Verily, my Lord has guided me to the straight path. (This is the path of) the well-founded Din (Religion), the path followed by Ibrahim (Abraham) single-mindedly devoted to Allah, turning aside from every falsehood. And he was not of the polytheists.’"
Cattle,6,162,"Say: ‘My Prayer, my ±ajj (Pilgrimage) and my sacrifice (together with the entire worship and servitude) and my life and my death are for Allah alone, the Lord of all the worlds."
Cattle,6,163,"He has no partner and of this have I been commanded, and I am the first Muslim (in the entire creation).’"
Cattle,6,164,"Say: ‘Should I look for a Lord other than Allah, whilst He is the Sustainer of everything? And whatever (sin) each soul earns, (its evil outcome) falls back upon it. And no bearer of burden will bear another’s burden. Then you are to return to your Lord alone, and He will inform you (of the truth of the matters) wherein you used to differ.’"
Cattle,6,165,"And He is the One Who has made you vicegerents in the earth, and exalted some of you over others in ranks, so that He may test you by means of (things) which He has bestowed upon you (as a trust). Surely, your Lord is swift in awarding punishment (to those who deserve it), but He is indeed Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful (towards the aspirants to forgiveness)."
The Heights,7,1,"Alif, Lam, Mim, Sad. (Only Allah and the Messenger [blessings and peace be upon him] know the real meaning.)"
The Heights,7,2,"(O Esteemed Beloved!) This is the Book (that) has been revealed to you. So, let there be no feeling of constriction in your (illumined) breast (on thinking of the disbelievers’ belying and denying the promulgation of its message. This has been revealed with the sole purpose) that by means of it you may warn (the ones who deny), and it (provides) direction and guidance to the believers."
The Heights,7,3,"(O people!) Follow this (Qur’an) which has been sent down to you from your Lord, and do not follow (any heretic rulers and) friends other than Him. You take advice but little!"
The Heights,7,4,And how many a town (is such as) We destroyed! Our torment came upon them at night or (whilst) they were asleep at noon.
The Heights,7,5,"And when Our torment came upon them, their cry was nothing (else) but they began to say: ‘No doubt we were the wrongdoers.’"
The Heights,7,6,"Then We shall certainly interrogate those to whom We sent Messengers, and We shall assuredly ask the Messengers as well (with regard to the response to their call for truth and their teaching and preaching)."
The Heights,7,7,"We shall then relate to them from (Our) knowledge (all their) affairs, and We were not absent (from anywhere, unable to monitor them)."
The Heights,7,8,"And on that Day, the weighing (of deeds) is a truth. So those whose scales (of righteous deeds) are heavy will be successful,"
The Heights,7,9,"But those whose scales (of righteous deeds) are light, it is they who have harmed their souls because they had been unjust to Our Revelations."
The Heights,7,10,"And surely, We established you firmly on earth with control and authority and created therein means of sustenance for you. Yet you thank but little."
The Heights,7,11,"And certainly, We did create you (i.e., your real being), then gave you shape (i.e., accomplished the phases of chemical and biological genesis and evolution of life till the completion of the physical existence of Adam). Then We commanded the angels: ‘Prostrate yourselves before Adam.’ They all prostrated themselves except Iblis; he was not of those who prostrate themselves."
The Heights,7,12,(Allah) said: ‘(O Iblis!) What inhibited you that you did not prostrate yourself when I commanded you?’ He said: ‘I am better than he. You have created me from fire and You have made him from clay.’
The Heights,7,13,"(Allah) said: ‘So, get you down from here. You have no right to show arrogance here. Away with you (from My presence)! You are certainly of the disgraced and the humiliated lot.’"
The Heights,7,14,He (Iblis) said: ‘Grant me respite (to live) till the Day when people will be raised up (from the graves).’
The Heights,7,15,"(Allah) said: ‘Indeed, you are of those granted respite.’"
The Heights,7,16,"He (Iblis) said: ‘Since You have led me astray, (I swear that) I will (also) sit on Your straight path (to waylay the children of Adam till I cause them to deviate from the path of truth)."
The Heights,7,17,"I will assuredly approach them from their front, from their rear, from their right and from their left, and (consequently) You will not find most of them grateful.’"
The Heights,7,18,"Allah commanded: ‘(O Iblis!) Be gone from here, humiliated and cursed. Whoever of them will follow you, I will certainly fill Hell with all of you."
The Heights,7,19,"And, O Adam, reside (both) you and your wife in Paradise and eat from wherever you wish. And (beware!) Do not go near this tree lest you become of those who transgress.’"
The Heights,7,20,"But Satan created doubt in the hearts of both (Adam and Hawwa [Eve]) in order to make manifest to them their private parts which were hidden (from their eyes). He said: ‘(O Adam and Hawwa [Eve],) your Lord has not forbidden you (eating fruit of) this tree, but (because, eating it,) you both will transform into angels (free from human characteristics), or both of you become (its) permanent residents (i.e., never will you be deprived of this station of proximity).’"
The Heights,7,21,"And he swore to both of them, saying: ‘I am indeed of your well-wishers.’"
The Heights,7,22,"So by means of deceit he tempted both of them down (into eating the fruit of the tree). When both had tasted (the fruit of) the tree, their private parts became manifest to them, and they started sticking the leaves of Paradise to their (bodies). Then their Lord called out to them: ‘Did I not forbid both of you (to get closer to) that tree, and did I (not) say to you: Satan is indeed an open enemy of you both?’"
The Heights,7,23,"Both of them submitted: ‘O our Lord! We have wronged our souls. And if You do not forgive us and have mercy on us, we shall certainly be amongst the losers.’"
The Heights,7,24,"(Allah) said: ‘Go down (all of you and live in the earth); some of you are enemies of others. A residence and means of living (have been determined) for you in the earth for a fixed term (i.e., you are sent down with two basic rights of dwelling and subsistence in the earth; so, organize and stabilize the system of your life on that basis).’"
The Heights,7,25,"(Allah) said: ‘You will spend your life in the very same earth, and will die in it, and from the same will you be brought forth (on the Day of Resurrection).’"
The Heights,7,26,"O mankind! Surely, We have sent down for you (such) clothing that hides your private parts and adds (to your) aesthetic value. And (in addition to your outward clothes, We have also provided you an inward dress as well, and that is) the dress of Godwariness (which) is the best. (All these inner and outer attires) are the signs of Allah so that they may take advice."
The Heights,7,27,"O mankind! (Beware!) Let not Satan put you to the test, as he ousted your parents from Paradise, stripping them of their dress so as to unveil to them their private parts. Indeed, he (himself) and his clan keep watching you (from such positions where) you cannot catch sight of them. Verily, We have made the satans friends of those who do not believe."
The Heights,7,28,"And when they commit some indecency, they say: ‘We found our ancestors on the same (way) and Allah has enjoined the same upon us.’ Say: ‘Allah does not enjoin acts of indecency. Do you say about (the Essence of) Allah such things as you do not know (even) yourselves?’"
The Heights,7,29,"Say: ‘My Lord has enjoined justice. And set your direction aright (towards the Ka‘ba) on every occasion and place of prostration. And worship Him, devoting your obedience sincerely to Him alone. As He has originated your (creation and life) so will you return (towards Him).’"
The Heights,7,30,"He guided one group, but error was proved against the other (consequent on their own doings). Indeed, they made friends with satans, leaving Allah aside, and think that they are the rightly guided."
The Heights,7,31,"O Children of Adam! Dress up decently every time you offer Prayer. And eat and drink, but do not spend extravagantly because certainly He does not like the extravagant."
The Heights,7,32,"Say: Who has forbidden the adornment (and beautification) of Allah that He has produced for His servants and (who has also forbidden) the pure and clean food?’ Say: ‘(All these bounties) that are (available generally) for the believers in the life of this world will be exclusively (for them) on the Day of Resurrection. This way, We elucidate Our Revelations for those who have knowledge.’"
The Heights,7,33,"Say: ‘My Lord has declared unlawful only (all) the indecent acts which become known and which remain hidden, and sins and unjust excesses, and that you associate with Allah that for which He has not sent down any authority, and (in addition) saying such things about (the Essence of) Allah that you do not know yourselves.’"
The Heights,7,34,"And a term (has been appointed) for every people, and when their (fixed) hour approaches, they can neither hold back nor advance (even) for a single moment."
The Heights,7,35,"O Children of Adam! If Messengers come to you from amongst yourselves who relate to you My Revelations, then whoever becomes Godfearing and pious and amends (himself), neither will any fear obsess them, nor will they grieve."
The Heights,7,36,"But those who belie Our Revelations and turn away from (believing in) them in defiance, it is they who are the inmates of Hell, its permanent residents."
The Heights,7,37,"Then who can be a greater wrongdoer than the one who fabricates a lie against Allah or rejects His Revelations as false? The share of such people will reach them as has been written in the Book until, when the (angels) whom We send will come to them to take away their souls, they will say (to them): ‘Now where are those (false gods) whom you used to worship besides Allah?’ They will say (replying): ‘They are lost from us (i.e., how they can be seen now!),’ and they will bear witness (themselves) against their own souls that they were doubtlessly disbelievers."
The Heights,7,38,"Allah will say: ‘Enter the Fire, joining those (Hellish) groups of jinn and men who have passed before you.’ Whenever a party will enter (Hell), it will curse its sister party until, when all (groups) will forgather, their successors will say in respect of their predecessors: ‘O our Lord, these are the people who led us astray, so increase their torment of Hell two times.’ He will say: ‘It is double for everyone but you know it not.’"
The Heights,7,39,"And their predecessors will say to their successors: ‘You have not gained any superiority over us, so you (too) taste the torment (now) for what you used to earn.’"
The Heights,7,40,"Indeed, those who reject Our Revelations as false and rebel against them, the gates of the heavens (of mercy and acceptance) shall not be opened to them, nor will they be able to enter Paradise until the camel passes through the eye of a needle (i.e., their entrance into Paradise will be impossible the same way). And it is like that We punish the evildoers."
The Heights,7,41,"The (Fire of) Hell will be their mattress as well as a covering over them, and We torment the wrongdoers the same way."
The Heights,7,42,"But those who believe and do good works persistently, We do not burden anyone beyond his endurance; it is they who are the people of Paradise; they will live in it forever."
The Heights,7,43,"And We shall remove from their breasts (rancour and) spite (that they had for others in the world). Streams will flow under (their palaces), and they will say: ‘All praise belongs to Allah alone, Who has brought us here. Had Allah not guided us, we would never have made our way through (to this station). Verily, the Messengers of our Lord brought us (the message of) truth.’ It will be called out (that Day): ‘You have been made heirs to this Paradise for the (pious) deeds that you used to do.’"
The Heights,7,44,And the people of Paradise will call out to the inmates of Hell: ‘We have really found true the promise that our Lord made to us. Have you (also) found true what your Lord promised (you)?’ They will answer: ‘Yes.’ Thereupon a herald will call out amongst them: ‘The curse of Allah is on the wrongdoers.
The Heights,7,45,(It is they) who used to hinder (the people) from the path of Allah and look for crookedness in it and they disbelieved in the Hereafter.’
The Heights,7,46,"And between both (of them, the inmates of Paradise and Hell) there is a barrier (i.e., ramparts or heights), and on the A‘raf (the Heights), there will be men who will recognize all by their features. And they will call out to the people of Paradise: ‘Peace be upon you.’ They (the people of the A‘raf [the Heights]) will not have entered Paradise (themselves as yet) but will be aspiring (to that)."
The Heights,7,47,"And when their eyes will be turned towards the inmates of Hell, they will say: ‘O our Lord, (join) us not (together) with the unjust people.’"
The Heights,7,48,"And the people of the A‘raf (the Heights) will call out to those people (of Hell) whom they will be recognizing by their identification marks saying (to them): ‘Your parties could not be of any use to you, nor (could rescue you) your arrogance you used to practise."
The Heights,7,49,Is it they about whom you used to swear (on seeing their miserable plight): Allah will (never) bless them with His mercy? (But listen! It is they who are now being called:) Enter Paradise; you will neither fear nor grieve.’
The Heights,7,50,"And the inmates of Hell will call out to the inhabitants of Paradise: ‘Bless us with some water (of Paradise), or of (the provision) that Allah has granted you.’ They will say: ‘Allah has indeed forbidden both (these bounties) to the disbelievers,"
The Heights,7,51,Those that made their din (religion) a funfair and sport and whom the worldly life had deceived.’ We shall forget them Today as they forgot their meeting of this Day (with Us) and as they used to deny Our Revelations.
The Heights,7,52,"And surely, We have brought them such a Book (the Qur’an) that We have elucidated on (the basis of Our) knowledge, a guidance and a mercy for those who believe."
The Heights,7,53,"They are just waiting for the outcome of that (stated matter). The Day when the outcome of that (matter) will be unfolded, the people who had forgotten it before this will say: ‘No doubt the Messengers of our Lord came with the truth. So, are there any intercessors (Today) who will intercede for us? Or, can we be returned (to the world again) so that (this time) we might do deeds different from (those) that we had been perpetrating (before)?’ They certainly harmed themselves, and that (lie and fabrication) which they used to invent has parted with them."
The Heights,7,54,"Indeed, Allah is your Lord, Who created the heavens and the earth in six aeons (i.e., six phases), and then (matching His Glory) established His authority on the Throne (i.e., enforced in the universe the system of His sovereign command and control). He covers the day with the night (under the arrangement that the day and the night) keep chasing one another swiftly. And the sun and the moon and the stars (all) have been subjected to (a system) under His command. Beware! He is the One Who runs the system of creating (everything), planning, command and control. Blessed is Allah, Who gradually and progressively sustains and nourishes all the worlds."
The Heights,7,55,"Invoke your Lord (both) most submissively and queitly. Surely, He does not like the transgressors."
The Heights,7,56,"And do not cause disruption and mischief in the land after it has been set in order (i.e., after reformation of the living conditions in the country). And keep supplicating Him fearing (His torment) and aspiring (to His mercy). Assuredly, Allah’s mercy is near to those who are (spiritually excellent,) committed to doing pious works."
The Heights,7,57,"And He is the One Who sends the winds as glad tidings before His mercy (i.e., rain), until, when these (winds) bring moisture-laden heavy clouds, We drive these (clouds) towards a town dead (of drought and infertility). Then We cause a downpour from (the clouds), and by means of this (water) We bring forth fruits of all kinds (from the earth). In like manner, We shall bring forth the dead (from the graves on the Day of Resurrection), so that you may take direction and guidance."
The Heights,7,58,"And the soil which is productive (i.e., fertile) yields vegetation (plentifully) by the command of Allah, but (the soil) which is sterile brings forth nothing except scanty rubbish. In the same way, We repeatedly elucidate (Our) Revelations (i.e., proofs and signs) for the people who are grateful."
The Heights,7,59,"Indeed, We sent Nuh (Noah) to his people. So he said: ‘O my people! Worship Allah; you have no other God except He. Verily, I fear for you the torment of a dreadful Day.’"
The Heights,7,60,"The chiefs and the affluent of his people said: ‘(O Nuh [Noah],) surely, we find you (caught) in an open error.’"
The Heights,7,61,"He said: ‘O my people, there is not any error in me, but (the truth is that) I am (raised as) a Messenger by the Lord of all the worlds."
The Heights,7,62,"I communicate to you the messages of my Lord and exhort you, and I know from Allah that which you do not know."
The Heights,7,63,"Do you wonder that direction and guidance from your Lord has come (on the tongue) of a man from amongst yourselves so that he may warn you (of the chastisement of Allah), and that you become Godfearing, and the purpose is that mercy may be shown to you?’"
The Heights,7,64,"Then they belied him. So We delivered him and those who were with him in the Ark, and We drowned all those who rejected Our Revelations as false. They were indeed a blind people (with no insight)."
The Heights,7,65,"And to (the people of) ‘Ad We (sent) their (kinship) brother Hud. He said: ‘O my people, always worship Allah; you have no other God except He. Will you not become Godfearing?’"
The Heights,7,66,"The chiefs and the affluent of his people who disbelieved (i.e., resisted and opposed the call for truth) said: ‘(O Hud,) we certainly find you (steeped) in foolishness, and we think you are surely one of the liars.’"
The Heights,7,67,"He said: ‘O my people, there is no foolishness about me, but (the truth is that) I am (raised as) a Messenger from the Lord of all the worlds."
The Heights,7,68,I am communicating to you the messages of my Lord and I am your trustworthy well-wisher.
The Heights,7,69,Do you wonder that direction and guidance from your Lord has come (on the tongue) of a man from amongst yourselves so that he may warn you (of the chastisement of Allah)? And call to mind when He made you the successors (in the land) after the people of Nuh (Noah) and in raising you amply augmented your power (might and stature). So remember the favours of Allah so that you may prosper.’
The Heights,7,70,"They said: ‘Have you come to us (that) we may worship only One God, Allah, and forsake (all those gods) whom our ancestors used to worship? So bring upon us that (torment) you have warned us of, if you are of the truthful.’"
The Heights,7,71,"He said: ‘Certainly, the torment and wrath upon you from your Lord has become inevitable. Do you dispute with me over the names (of those idols) which you (yourselves) and your ancestors have (supposedly) named and for which Allah has not sent down any authority? So wait (for the torment); I am (also) with you amongst those who wait.’"
The Heights,7,72,"Then We emancipated him and those who were on his side by Our Mercy, and cut the roots of those who denied Our Revelations. And they were those who would never have believed."
The Heights,7,73,"And to (the people of) Thamud We (sent) their (kinship) brother Salih. He said: ‘O my people, always worship Allah; you have no other God except He. Indeed, there has come to you from your Lord a clear sign. This she-camel of Allah is a sign for you. So leave her (free) to graze in Allah’s earth, and do not touch her with an evil (intention), or a grievous torment will seize you.’"
The Heights,7,74,"And remember when He made you successors (in the land) after (the people of) ‘Ad and granted you settlement in the land. You build castles in the soft (plain) areas, and carve out mountains to chisel dwellings (out of them). So remember (these) Favours of Allah, and do not cause disruption and mischief in the land."
The Heights,7,75,The arrogant and rebellious chiefs and the rich of his people asked the poor and the downtrodden who had accepted faith: ‘Are you sure that Salih has been really sent from his Lord (as His Messenger)?’ They said: ‘We surely believe in whatever he has been sent with.’
The Heights,7,76,The arrogant said: ‘No doubt we strongly deny (that) which you have believed in.’
The Heights,7,77,So they killed the she-camel (by hamstringing) and rebelled against the command of their Lord and said: ‘O Salih! Bring upon us that (torment) you have threatened us with if you are (truly) from amongst the Messengers.’
The Heights,7,78,"So (the torment of) a high-scale earthquake seized them, and, in the morning, they lay (dead) in their homes with faces down upon the ground."
The Heights,7,79,"Then (Salih) turned away from them, saying: ‘O my people, verily I delivered the message of my Lord to you and gave you advice (as well) but you do not like the counsellors.’"
The Heights,7,80,And (likewise We sent) Lut ([Lot] as well) when he said to his people: ‘Do you perpetrate (such) lasciviousness as no people in the world have attempted before you?
The Heights,7,81,"Verily, you go after men for your lust, leaving the women; you are in truth given to transgression.’"
The Heights,7,82,"And his people had no reply except that they said: ‘Drive them out of the town; indeed, they seek the utmost purity!’"
The Heights,7,83,"So We delivered him (Lut [Lot]) and his family, except his wife; she was one of those who stayed on in torment."
The Heights,7,84,And We rained on them (stones). See then what was the end of the evildoers!
The Heights,7,85,"And towards Madyan (We sent) their (kinship) brother Shu‘ayb. He said: ‘O my people, always worship Allah; you have no God except He. Indeed, there has come to you from your Lord a clear sign. So give full measure and weight, and do not decrease whilst giving people their things, nor create mischief in the land after reformation (of the living conditions). This is better for you if you believe (in the divine message)."
The Heights,7,86,And do not sit on every path to frighten everyone who has embraced faith in this (call) and to hinder (him) from the path of Allah and to look for any crookedness in this (Message to make him feel frustrated and disgusted with the true Din [Religion]). And remember (Allah’s favour) when you were small in number and He multiplied you. And see what was the end of those who spread mischief and cause disruption!
The Heights,7,87,"And if a party amongst you have believed in that (Din [Religion]) which I have been sent with, and some other party have not believed in it, then, (O believers,) have patience till Allah judges between us, and He is the Best of judges."
The Heights,7,88,"The rebellious and arrogant chiefs and the affluent of his people said: ‘O Shu‘ayb, we shall in any case drive you out of our town and those who, in your company, have embraced faith, or else you shall have to return to our religion.’ Shu‘ayb said: ‘Even though we despise (to return to your religion)?"
The Heights,7,89,"Indeed, we would invent a lie against Allah if we returned to your religion after Allah has saved us from it. And it is not at all (appropriate) for us to return to that (religion) unless Allah, our Lord, so wills. As for His knowledge, our Lord encompasses everything; we have put our trust in Allah alone. O our Lord, judge between us and our (hostile) people with truth, and You are the Best of judges.’"
The Heights,7,90,"And the chiefs and the affluent of his people, who had disbelieved (and denied the truth), said: ‘O people, if you follow Shu‘ayb, then you will surely be the losers.’"
The Heights,7,91,"Then a (torment of) high-scale earthquake seized them, and in the morning, they were dead, lying prone in their homes."
The Heights,7,92,"Those who belied Shu‘ayb were (annihilated) as if they had (never) lived in that (town). Those who belied Shu‘ayb, it was (in fact) they who became the losers."
The Heights,7,93,"Then (Shu‘ayb) separated from them and said: ‘O my people, verily, I communicated to you the Messages of my Lord and I admonished you (as well). Then why should I regret (the devastation of) a disbelieving people?’"
The Heights,7,94,"And never did We send a Messenger to any land but that We seized its inhabitants with hardship, scarcity, adversity and suffering (due to belying and defying the Messenger) so that they might humble themselves."
The Heights,7,95,We then changed (their) misfortune with good fortune till they made (an all-embracing) progress. But (out of ingratitude) they said: ‘Our ancestors too have been living through pain and pleasure (the same way).’ So We caught them unawares on this ingratitude and they did not even notice (it).
The Heights,7,96,"But if the inhabitants of (these) towns had embraced faith and adopted Godwariness, We would have opened to them blessings from the heaven and the earth. But they rejected (the truth). So We seized them with (torment) for the (impious acts) they used to perpetrate."
The Heights,7,97,Have the residents of the towns now become free of this fear that Our torment may seize them (again) at night when they are (fast) asleep (in carefree slumber)?
The Heights,7,98,Or are the residents of the towns free of this fear that Our torment may seize them (again) in the forenoon when they are at play (completely lost in the worldly pleasures)?
The Heights,7,99,"Are they fearless of Allah’s secret plan? So, no one feels fearless against the secret plan of Allah except the people who run into loss."
The Heights,7,100,"Does (this also) not guide and (enlighten) those who have inherited the earth (themselves) after (the destruction of) those (one time) dwelling in the earth that if We desire, We may punish them (as well) for their sins, and We shall seal their hearts (due to their evil behaviour), so they will be unable to hear (and understand the truth)?"
The Heights,7,101,"These are the towns whose news We are narrating to you. Surely, their Messengers came to them with clear signs. But (even then) they were not apt to believe in what they had rejected before. That is how Allah seals up the hearts of the disbelievers."
The Heights,7,102,"And We did not find (the fulfilment of) commitment in most of them, and We found most of them but disobedient."
The Heights,7,103,"Then after them, We sent Musa (Moses) with Our signs to Pharaoh and the nobles of his (court), but they did injustice to (these proofs and miracles). See, then, what was the end of those who spread mischief and strife!"
The Heights,7,104,"And Musa (Moses) said: ‘O Pharaoh! Indeed, I am (raised as) a Messenger from the Lord of all the worlds."
The Heights,7,105,What behooves me is to say (nothing) about Allah but the truth. I have indeed brought you a clear sign from your Lord. So send away with me the Children of Israel (setting them free of your yoke of slavery).’
The Heights,7,106,"He (Pharaoh) said: ‘If you have brought a sign, then bring it (to the fore) if you are truthful.’"
The Heights,7,107,"So Musa (Moses) put his staff (down), and at once it changed into a veritable serpent."
The Heights,7,108,"And he drew out his hand (after putting it into his collar opening), and that (too) at once became (radiant) white to the viewers."
The Heights,7,109,The chiefs of Pharaoh’s people said: ‘He is undoubtedly an expert magician.
The Heights,7,110,"(O people!) He seeks to drive you out of your land. So, what do you advise?’"
The Heights,7,111,"They said: ‘Put (the matter) of Musa (Moses) and his brother off (for a while), and send out heralds to (different) cities to summon (magicians)."
The Heights,7,112,They will bring you every skilful sorcerer.’
The Heights,7,113,And the magicians came to Pharaoh and said: ‘There should certainly be some reward for us if we overmaster.’
The Heights,7,114,"Pharaoh said: ‘Yes, of course; (what to talk of a simple reward! In that case) you will be amongst the privileged ones (of my court).’"
The Heights,7,115,(The magicians) said: ‘Musa (Moses)! Either you throw (your object) or we become (the first) to throw.’
The Heights,7,116,"Musa (Moses) said: ‘You throw (first).’ So when they threw (their strings and sticks on the ground), they bewitched the eyes of the people, and struck them with awe, and brought (forth) an extremely effective magic."
The Heights,7,117,And We revealed to Musa (Moses): ‘(Now) throw your staff (on the ground).’ Then at once it began swallowing up what they had fabricated through deception.
The Heights,7,118,"So, the truth was established, and everything that they had been doing was proved false."
The Heights,7,119,"So, they (the representatives of Pharaoh) were vanquished on the spot and backed away humiliated."
The Heights,7,120,And (all) the sorcerers fell down prostrate.
The Heights,7,121,"They exclaimed: ‘We believe in the (real) Sustainer of all the worlds,"
The Heights,7,122,(The) Lord of Musa (Moses) and Harun (Aaron).’
The Heights,7,123,Pharaoh said: ‘(Have) you believed in Him even before I permitted you? This is indeed a plot which you (all) have hatched (against me) in this city in order that you may expatriate from this (country) its (Coptic) inhabitants. So you will know (its consequences) very soon.
The Heights,7,124,"Surely, I shall cut off your hands and your feet on alternate sides, and then, most certainly, I shall crucify all of you.’"
The Heights,7,125,"They said: ‘Verily, we are to return to our Lord."
The Heights,7,126,"And which of our acts has annoyed you, except that we have believed in the (true) signs of our Lord when they reached us? O our Lord! Gush on us torrents of patience and lift us (from the world) as (steadfast) Muslims.’"
The Heights,7,127,"And (considering it a threat to their tyrannous rule) the chiefs of the people of Pharaoh said (to Pharaoh): ‘Will you leave Musa (Moses) and his people to launch strife in the country? And (then) will they spare you and your gods?’ He said: ‘(No,) we shall now kill their sons (to exhaust their male numerical strength), and let their women live (so that they may be wronged). And surely, we hold sway over them.’"
The Heights,7,128,"Musa (Moses) said to his people: ‘Seek help from Allah and be steadfast; surely, the earth belongs to Allah. He makes its inheritors whom He likes of His servants. And it ends well for the Godfearing alone.’"
The Heights,7,129,They said: ‘(O Musa [Moses]!) We were persecuted before you came to us and after your arrival as well. (We have suffered both ways. When will our misery end?) Musa ([Moses] appeasing his people) said: ‘Your Lord will soon destroy your enemy and (then) make you the successors (to the governance) in the land and He will then monitor how you perform (after coming to power).’
The Heights,7,130,"Then We seized the people of Pharaoh with (the torment of) some years (of famine) and a scarce yield of fruits, so that they might be admonished."
The Heights,7,131,"But whenever relief reached them, they would say: ‘This is owing to us.’ And when adversity befell them, they would ascribe it as an ill-omen to Musa (Moses) and his companions (of faith). Beware! Their omen (i.e., the evil outcome of their doings) lies with Allah alone. But most of them do not know."
The Heights,7,132,"And they (the people of Pharaoh) said (arrogantly): ‘(O Musa [Moses]!) Whatever sign you bring us to cast a spell upon us, we are not prone to believe in you.’"
The Heights,7,133,"Then We sent upon them (many) distinct signs (as chastisement): storms, locusts, lice, frogs and blood. (Even) then they continued with arrogance and rebellion, and they were an (extremely) sinful people."
The Heights,7,134,"And when (some) torment befell them, they would say: ‘O Musa (Moses)! Pray for us to your Lord by means of (His) promise with you. If you avert this torment from us, we will surely believe in you, and will send with you the Children of Israel (setting them free).’"
The Heights,7,135,"But when We would remove from them the torment for the appointed term, which they nearly completed, they would at once break their promise."
The Heights,7,136,"Then, ultimately, We took retribution from them (for all their disobedience and breach of promises) and drowned them in the river because they (successively) belied Our Revelations and were (absolutely) neglectful of them."
The Heights,7,137,"And We made the people (the Children of Israel) who were powerless and oppressed the inheritors of the east and the west of the land (Egypt and Syria) wherein We had placed blessing. And (in this way), a fair promise of your Lord with the Children of Israel was fulfilled, because they remained steadfast (in the face of Pharaoh’s tyranny and oppression). And We destroyed (those magnificent castles) which Pharaoh and his people had built, and those towers (and the gardens) too which they used to raise high."
The Heights,7,138,And We brought the Children of Israel across the (Red) Sea where they came upon a people who were squatting around their idols (for worship) in deep devotion. They (the Children of Israel) said: ‘O Musa (Moses)! Make for us too a god like the ones they have.’ Musa (Moses) said: ‘You are surely a very ignorant people.
The Heights,7,139,"Verily, that whose (worship) they are (tangled in) is destined to ruin, and whatever they are doing is (utter) falsehood.’"
The Heights,7,140,"(Musa [Moses]) said: ‘Should I seek for you a god other than Allah, whilst He (Allah) is the One Who has granted you superiority over all the worlds?’"
The Heights,7,141,"And remember (the time) when We delivered you from (the tyranny and violence of) the people of Pharaoh, who used to afflict you with fierce torment. They used to slay your boys and spare your girls. And in that, there was a great trial for you from your Lord."
The Heights,7,142,"And We promised Musa (Moses) thirty nights, and We made it good by adding to it (another) ten (nights). So the term (appointed) by his Lord was completed in forty nights. And Musa (Moses) said to his brother Harun (Aaron): ‘(In the meanwhile,) officiate at my seat amongst my people and continue to do (their) reformation, and follow not the way of those who create mischief (i.e., prevent them from treading this path).’"
The Heights,7,143,"And when Musa (Moses) came at the time (set) by Us and his Lord spoke to him, he (ardently aspired to behold Him out of the pleasure of hearing Allah’s Word and) submitted: ‘O Lord, show me (Your Beauty) so that I may savour Your Sight.’ Allah said: ‘By no means can you look upon Me (directly), but look towards the mountain. So if it stays firm in its place, then soon will you behold My beauty.’ When his Lord unveiled the Light (of His divine beauty) on to the mountain, (He) crushed it into sand particles (with the intense divine radiance) and Musa (Moses) fell down unconscious. Then when he recovered, he submitted: ‘Holy You are and I turn to You in repentance and I am the first of those who believe.’"
The Heights,7,144,(Allah) said: ‘O Musa (Moses)! I have exalted you and chosen you above the people by My Messages and My speech. So hold fast to whatever I have bestowed upon you and be amongst the grateful.’
The Heights,7,145,"And We (have) inscribed for him on the Tablets (of the Torah) instructions for every matter and details of everything. ‘Hold it with firmness, and enjoin your people (as well) to adopt the best thereof. Soon shall I show you the abode of the disobedient.’"
The Heights,7,146,"I shall keep those who are unjustly arrogant in the land from (comprehending and accepting) My Revelations. And (even) if they see all signs, they will not believe in them, and (even) if they find the path of guidance, they will not adopt it as (their) way, but if they perceive the wrong path, they will embrace it as their way. It is because they denied Our Revelations and remained negligent of them."
The Heights,7,147,"And those who belie Our Revelations and the meeting of the Last Day, their actions become void. What will they be rewarded except what they have been doing?"
The Heights,7,148,"And after Musa ([Moses] left for the Mount of Tur), his people contrived a calf out of their ornaments (which was) a carving with a mooing sound. Did they not see that it could neither speak to them nor show them any path? They took the same (as god) and they were unjust."
The Heights,7,149,"And when they felt deeply ashamed of what they had done, and realized that they had really gone astray, they said: ‘If our Lord does not have mercy on us and forgive us, we shall certainly be amongst the losers.’"
The Heights,7,150,"And when Musa (Moses) returned to his people with pent-up anger and grief, he said: ‘You have perpetrated a serious evil in my absence (i.e., after my departure). Did you make haste by the command of your Lord?’ And (Musa [Moses]) put down the Tablets (of the Torah), and, catching his brother’s head, pulled him towards himself. (Then) Harun (Aaron) said: ‘O son of my mother! Surely, these people considered me weak and had nearly killed me (on my forbidding). So do not provide the enemies an opportunity to laugh at me, nor include me amongst (the clan of) these wrongdoers.’"
The Heights,7,151,Musa (Moses) said: ‘O my Lord! Forgive me and my brother and admit us to (the Embrace of) Your Mercy and You are the Most Merciful of those who show mercy.’
The Heights,7,152,"Surely, those who have taken the calf (as a god), the wrath from their Lord will seize them together with humiliation in the life of this world. That is how We punish those who invent falsehood."
The Heights,7,153,"But those who perpetrate evil works, then repent afterwards and believe, (then) after that your Lord is indeed Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful."
The Heights,7,154,"And when the anger of Musa (Moses) subsided, he picked up the Tablets, and in the inscription of these (Tablets) was (mentioned) guidance and mercy for those who fear their Lord much."
The Heights,7,155,"And Musa (Moses) chose seventy men of his people for a time set by Us (to appear before Our presence for forgiveness), but when a high-scale earthquake seized them (as punishment for not forbidding the people to perpetrate evil), Musa (Moses) submitted: ‘O Lord! If You willed, You would destroy these people and me even before this. Will You cause us to perish for that (omission) which the foolish amongst us have committed? This is just a trial from You by which You hold astray whom You will and guide whom You desire. You alone are our Guardian, so forgive us and have mercy on us. And You are the Best of those who forgive."
The Heights,7,156,"And ordain for us good in (the life of) this world and in the Hereafter (as well). Surely, we have turned and totally inclined towards You.’ (Allah) said: ‘I inflict My punishment on whom I will and My mercy encompasses everything. So, I shall soon prescribe this (mercy) for those who adopt Godwariness and pay Zakat (the Alms-due) regularly, and it is they who have faith in Our Revelations."
The Heights,7,157,"(They are the people) who follow the Messenger, the Prophet (titled as) al-Ummi (who imparts to the people from Allah the news of the unseen and knowledge and secrets of socio-economic disciplines of life without himself being taught by any human in the world); whose (eminent attributes and exquisite powers) these people find written in the Torah and the Injil (Gospel); who enjoins on them virtues and forbids them vices, declares wholesome things lawful and impure ones unlawful for them and removes from them their heavy burdens and yokes (i.e., shackles) weighing upon them (due to their acts of disobedience and blesses them with freedom). So those who will believe in this (most exalted Messenger [blessings and peace be upon him]) and venerate and revere him and serve and support him (in his Din [Religion]) and follow this light (the Qur’an) that has been sent down with him, it is they who will flourish and prosper.’"
The Heights,7,158,"Say: ‘O mankind! I have (come) to all of you (as) the Messenger of Allah to Whom belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. There is no God except He. He is the One Who grants life and causes death.’ So believe in Allah and His Messenger, who is a Prophet crowned with the glory of being al-Ummi (i.e., he has not learnt anything from anyone except Allah, but knows far more than the entire creation, and is innocent and pure like a newborn baby, despite his upbringing in an infidel and polytheistic society), who believes in Allah and (all) His (revealed) Books and follow him alone so that you may take guidance."
The Heights,7,159,And a party amongst the people of Musa ([Moses] comprises those) who guide to the path of truth and according to that (make judgments based on) justice.
The Heights,7,160,"And We divided them into twelve tribes as separate communities. And when his people asked him for water, We sent (this) Revelation to Musa (Moses): ‘Strike that rock with your staff.’ So twelve springs gushed out from it and every tribe found its drinking place. And We stretched over them clouds for shade and sent down to them manna and quails (and said to them:) ‘Eat of the pure things that We have provided for you.’ But they have not wronged Us (by disobedience and disregard). They have rather wronged their own souls."
The Heights,7,161,"And (recall) when it was said to them: ‘Dwell in this town (Bayt al-Maqdis [Jerusalem] or Ariha [Jericho]) and eat of it wherever you like and continue saying (with your tongue): ‘Forgive (our sins),’ and enter the gate (of the city) in a state of prostration; (then) We shall forgive all your sins. Soon shall We grant more favours to the pious."
The Heights,7,162,But the unjust amongst them substituted some other statement for that which they were told. So We sent upon them torment from heaven because they were engaged in injustice and wickedness.
The Heights,7,163,"And enquire of them the plight of the town which was situated on the seashore when they transgressed (the commandments with regard to the Sabbath) Saturday. (This occurred) when the fish swarmed from all sides, appearing to (the surface of) water on their (venerated) Saturday. And (the fish) would not come to them on (the rest of) the days, which they did not revere like Saturday. We were trying them this way because they were disobedient."
The Heights,7,164,"And when a section of them said (to those who were performing the duty of preaching—da‘wa): ‘Why do you advise a people whom Allah is about to destroy or afflict with severe torment?’ they replied: ‘In order to submit (our) excuse before your Lord, and (also) because they may become righteous and Godwary.’"
The Heights,7,165,"Then, when they forgot (all) they had been advised, We delivered those who were engaged in forbidding evil (i.e., performing the duty of preaching don’ts), and seized (the rest of) the people who committed injustice (actively or passively) with a very harsh punishment because they were disobeying."
The Heights,7,166,"Then when they defied (the command to give up) what they were prohibited, We commanded them: ‘Be you apes, despised and detested.’"
The Heights,7,167,"And (also recall) when your Lord announced (this) command (to the Jews) that (Allah) shall be bringing upon them such (one or the other) tyrant as would continue afflicting them with evil hardships till the Day of Resurrection. Surely, your Lord is Swift in punishment, and indeed He is Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful (as well)."
The Heights,7,168,"And We divided them into several communities (and scattered) over the earth. Some amongst them are righteous and, unlike them, others from amongst the (same) folk are (evildoers). And We tried them with (both) prosperity and adversity so that they might turn (towards Allah)."
The Heights,7,169,"Then after them a characterless people who inherited the Book succeeded (them). These (successors) take (as bribe) the wealth and riches of this base (world) and say: ‘Soon shall we be forgiven,’ whilst if more of similar riches come to them, they will take that too. Was the promise of the Book (of Allah) not taken from them that they would not say of Allah (anything) but the truth? And they had read (all) that was (written) in it. And the abode of the Hereafter is of greater value for those who adopt Godwariness. Do you not understand?"
The Heights,7,170,"And those who hold fast to the Book (of Allah) and establish Prayer (with punctuality, then) certainly We do not waste the reward of those who reform."
The Heights,7,171,"And (recall) when We raised the mountain over them as though it were a canopy and they feared it was about to fall on them. (So We said to them: ‘Do not fear; instead) hold fast to that (Book pragmatically), which We have given you, and bear well in mind those (injunctions) which are (contained) in it so that you are protected (from the torment).’"
The Heights,7,172,And (call to mind) when your Lord brought forth the human race from the loins of the Children of Adam and made them bear testimony to their own souls (and said:) ‘Am I not your Lord?’ They (all) said: ‘Why not! We bear witness (that You alone are our Lord.’ This He did) lest you should say on the Day of Resurrection: ‘We were unaware of this promise.’
The Heights,7,173,"Or (lest) you start saying: ‘It was but our ancestors who associated partners with Allah before, and we were but (their) descendants after them (i.e., they are the real sinners, not we). So, will You destroy us on account of that (sin) which the infidels perpetrated?’"
The Heights,7,174,And this is how We elucidate Our Revelations so that they may turn (towards the truth).
The Heights,7,175,"And (also) relate to them his account to whom We gave Our signs, but then he made an exit from their (knowledge and admonition) and Satan chased him. So he turned into one of those who lost the right path."
The Heights,7,176,"And had We so willed, We would have exalted him by means of (knowledge and implementation of) these (Revelations), but he (himself) inclined to (the lowest levels of the) earthly life and became a follower of his lust. (Now) his example is that of a dog: if you treat him harshly, he will loll out his tongue, or if you leave him alone, he will (still) loll out his tongue. This example is of those who deny Our Revelations. So relate these occurrences (to the people) so that they may contemplate."
The Heights,7,177,"As an example, they were an extremely bad community who belied Our Revelations! (In fact) they persistently wronged their own souls."
The Heights,7,178,"He whom Allah guides, so he alone is the rightly guided, but he whom Allah holds astray, it is they who are the losers."
The Heights,7,179,"And surely, We have created a large (number) of jinn and human beings for Hell: they have hearts (and minds but) cannot understand (the truth) with them; and they have eyes (but) cannot perceive (the truth) with them; and (also) they possess ears (but) cannot hear (the truth) with them. They are like cattle, rather more misguided (than them). It is they who are neglectful."
The Heights,7,180,"And the Most Beautiful Names belong to Allah alone, so call on Him by these Names. And leave aside those people who turn away from the truth with regard to His Names. Soon will they be punished for the (impious acts) that they perpetrate."
The Heights,7,181,"And of those whom We have created there is (also) a section (of people) who direct others towards the truth, and alongside that make judgments based on justice."
The Heights,7,182,"But those who deny Our Revelations, We shall soon lead them gradually towards catastrophe in such an imperceptible manner that they will not even notice it."
The Heights,7,183,"And I am giving them respite; indeed, My grip is inescapable."
The Heights,7,184,"Have they not reflected that the Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him), who honours them with (his) companionship, has not contracted any mania? He is only a plain Warner (to the disobedient)."
The Heights,7,185,Have they not looked into the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and whatever Allah has created (apart from that? And have they not considered that) it may well be that their appointed term (death) has drawn near? Then what will they believe in after this?
The Heights,7,186,There is no guide for the one whom Allah holds astray. And He leaves them to wander in defiance so that they may grope on.
The Heights,7,187,"These (disbelievers) ask you about the Last Hour: ‘When will it take place?’ Say: ‘Knowledge of it rests with my Lord alone; none but He (Allah) will manifest it at its (appointed) time. It is (seemingly) heavy on (the inhabitants of) the heavens and the earth (due to the horror of its adversities and intensities). It will occur to you all of a sudden (accidentally).’ They ask you (in such a manner) as if you are engaged in its pursuit! Say: ‘Its knowledge is only with Allah, but most people do not know (this fact).’"
The Heights,7,188,"(Also) tell (them): ‘I do not have any control over profit and loss for myself, except (that much) which Allah wills. And (in the same way) if I had the knowledge of the Unseen on my own (without Allah’s bestowal), I would myself have managed abundant good fortune (and victories), and no hardship (and trouble on any occasion) would have touched me. (By virtue of my station as a Messenger) I am only a Warner and a Bearer of glad tidings for the believers.’*"
The Heights,7,189,"And He (Allah) is the One Who has created you from a single soul and made his spouse from that, so that he might find comfort in her. Then when man covers her, she conceives and, bearing a light burden, moves around. Later, when she grows heavy, then both pray to their Lord, Allah: ‘If You give us a healthy child, we shall certainly be amongst the thankful.’"
The Heights,7,190,"Then when He gives them a healthy child, both of them associate partners with Him with respect to that (child). But Allah is Transcendent above all that they ascribe to Him as partners."
The Heights,7,191,Do they associate as partners with Him those who cannot create anything and have (themselves) been created?
The Heights,7,192,"Neither do they have power to help these (polytheists), nor can they help even themselves."
The Heights,7,193,"And if you call them to (the path of) guidance, they will not follow you. For you, it is all the same whether you call them (towards guidance and truth) or you remain silent."
The Heights,7,194,"Surely, those (idols) whom you worship besides Allah are also slaves (of Allah) just like you. So when you call on them, they should answer you if you are true (in making them gods)."
The Heights,7,195,Do they have feet to walk with or hands to hold with or eyes to see with or ears to hear with? Say: ‘(O disbelievers!) Call your (false) partners (for my destruction). Then execute (your) plot against me and do not give me any respite.
The Heights,7,196,"Indeed, my Helper is Allah, Who has revealed the Book, and He is the One Who also protects and helps the pious."
The Heights,7,197,"And the (idols) whom you worship besides Him have no power to help you, nor can they help themselves.’"
The Heights,7,198,"And if you call them towards guidance, they cannot (even) hear. And you see these (idols are sculptured in such a way) as if they were looking at you, whereas they do not see (anything)."
The Heights,7,199,"(O Esteemed Beloved!) Adopt forbearance, always command piousness, and keep aloof from the ignorant."
The Heights,7,200,"And, (O man,) if some evil impulse from Satan provokes you (against these matters), seek refuge with Allah. Undoubtedly, He is All-Hearing, All-Knowing."
The Heights,7,201,"Surely, those who have adopted piety, when some temptation from Satan touches them, they actively remember (the commands and prohibitions of Allah and the wickedness and hostility of Satan). So, the eyes (of their hearts) open up right away."
The Heights,7,202,"And (as for) the brothers of these satans, they draw them deeper into error (by whispering suspicions) and do not slacken (in promoting mischief and bloodshed)."
The Heights,7,203,"And when you do not bring them any sign, (then) they say: ‘Why have you not brought it contriving yourself?’ Say: ‘I just follow that (command) which is revealed to me from my Lord. This (Qur’an) is a (collection) of conclusive proofs and guidance and mercy from your Lord for those who believe.’"
The Heights,7,204,"And when the Qur’an is recited, listen to it attentively, and observe silence so that mercy may be bestowed upon you."
The Heights,7,205,And remember your Lord in your heart with humility and tearful submissiveness and fear and repentance and also by calling in low tones. (Persevere with His remembrance) morning and evening and be not of the neglectful.
The Heights,7,206,"Indeed, the (angels) who are close in the presence of your Lord (never) turn away from His worship in arrogance, and they glorify Him (all the time) and remain prostrate before Him."
Spoils of War,8,1,"(O Esteemed Messenger!) They ask you about the spoils of war. Say: ‘The spoils belong to Allah and the Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him). So, fear Allah and keep your mutual matters set aright, and obey Allah and His Messenger if you are believers.’"
Spoils of War,8,2,"The believers are only those whose hearts, when Allah is mentioned (before them), are filled with awe (at the very idea of Allah’s Greatness and Might). And when His Revelations are recited to them, they (the ecstatic, delightful, sweet and sublime Words of the Beloved) increase their faith, and they (maintain) their trust in their Lord alone (under all circumstances, and do not look towards anyone other than Him)."
Spoils of War,8,3,"(They) are those who establish Prayer, and spend (in the cause of Allah) out of whatever We have bestowed upon them."
Spoils of War,8,4,It is they who are (in fact) the true believers. For them are (high) ranks with their Lord and forgiveness and an honourable provision.
Spoils of War,8,5,"(O Beloved!) As your Lord brought you forth from your home (to fight) for (the great cause of) truth, whilst a section of the believers was unhappy (about it),"
Spoils of War,8,6,"They started disputing with you about the cause of truth even after disclosure (of the good news that help from Allah would arrive, and the forces of Muhammad [blessings and peace be upon him] would triumph), as if they were being driven towards death and could see (death with their eyes)."
Spoils of War,8,7,"And (recall the time) when Allah promised you that dominance and victory over one of the two groups of (the disbelievers of Mecca) would certainly be yours. And you desired that the (group) without weapons (the weaker one) should fall into your hands, but Allah willed to establish the truth by His Words and cut off the roots of the disbelievers (i.e., their might and splendour through the Muslims’ victory over the enemy’s bigger and well-equipped troops),"
Spoils of War,8,8,"So that (the battle of Badr) might establish (through this great victory) the truth as truth and falsehood as false, even though the wicked might dislike (this decisiveness of the armed conflict between the forces of truth and falsehood)."
Spoils of War,8,9,(Remember) when you were supplicating your Lord (for support) and He granted your supplication (and said:) ‘I am going to help you with a thousand angels coming in succession.’
Spoils of War,8,10,"And Allah made this (form of help) merely good news in order that your hearts are reassured thereby. And (in truth) there is no (other) help except the help from Allah. Indeed, Allah alone is Almighty, Most Wise."
Spoils of War,8,11,(Remember) when He brought upon you drowsiness to (provide you a feeling) feeling of peace and security from Himself and sent down upon you water from the heavens to provide you (inward and outward) purity by that and remove from you the filth of Satan’s (heretic suspicions) and invigorate your hearts with (the strength of certitude) and with that make your feet (unshakably) firm.
Spoils of War,8,12,"(O Esteemed Beloved! Also recall the majestic sight of your glory) when (on the occasion of the battle of Badr) your Lord revealed to the angels the message: ‘I am (also) with you (to support the Companions of the Messenger). So, keep the believers firm-footed and steadfast (by good news and support); I will cast awesomeness (of Muhammad’s forces [blessings and peace be upon him]) into the hearts of the (aggressing) disbelievers right now. So, strike at the nape of (the combatant disbelievers’) necks and crush all their tendons and joints (during the war, in response to their plan and war strategy against you).’"
Spoils of War,8,13,"That is because they defied Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him). And he who defies Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him), then surely Allah will seize (him) with severe torment."
Spoils of War,8,14,"This is (the torment in this world), so taste it (first), and surely there is (another) torment of Hell (as well) for the disbelievers (in the Hereafter)."
Spoils of War,8,15,"O believers! When you combat the disbelievers (in the battlefield), never turn your backs on them, (even if they are) a large army."
Spoils of War,8,16,"And he who turns his back on them that day, except he who is maneuvering in the fight, or he who wants to join one of his own troops (for support), certainly he returns with the wrath of Allah and Hell is his abode and that is (the most) evil abode."
Spoils of War,8,17,"(O soldiers of the Army of Islam!) It is not you who killed the disbelievers (who initiated war against you) but it is Allah Who killed them, and, (O Glorious Beloved,) when you smote (them with pebbles), it was not you who smote them, but Allah smote, (so) that He confers upon the believers great favours from Him. Allah is indeed All-Hearing, All-Knowing."
Spoils of War,8,18,"This is (one favour and bestowal), and (the other is that) Allah does weaken the plots and deceitful strategies of the disbelievers."
Spoils of War,8,19,"(O disbelievers!) If you sought a decisive victory, then the victory (of the truth) has certainly reached you. It will be best for you if you desist (even now). But if you opt for the same (mischief), We shall (also) afflict you with the same (punishment) and your army, may it be of any large size, will not be of any avail to you. And Allah is surely on the side of the believers."
Spoils of War,8,20,O believers! Obey Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) and do not turn away from him whilst you are hearing.
Spoils of War,8,21,"And do not be like those who said (by way of betraying): ‘We have heard,’ whereas they do not hear."
Spoils of War,8,22,"Surely, the worst of the living creatures in the sight of Allah are the deaf and the dumb who (neither listen to nor speak the truth and) also do not understand (the truth)."
Spoils of War,8,23,"And had Allah known even a little (inclination towards) good in them, He would (certainly) have made them hear. But (their state of mind is such that) if He makes them hear (the truth), they will (even then) turn away, and they are those who are averse (to the truth)."
Spoils of War,8,24,"O believers! Whenever the Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) calls you for some assignment that brings you (eternal) life, present yourselves (immediately), responding to (both) Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) with submissiveness and obedience. And bear in mind that Allah intervenes between man and his heart (with a Glory of exclusive nearness), and that all of you will (ultimately) be gathered towards Him."
Spoils of War,8,25,And fear the plague which will not afflict exclusively those who are the tyrants amongst you (but its victims will also include those who are accomplices in tyranny or who remain indifferent to it). And bear in mind that Allah is Severe in inflicting torment.
Spoils of War,8,26,"And (call to mind the time) when (numerically) you were small (i.e., in the minority, in the Meccan period,) and oppressed in the country (i.e., economically unstable and victims of exploitation). You were (also) afraid that (the powerful) people would snatch you away (i.e., socially too you were neither free nor secure). So, (after migration to Medina,) He (Allah) provided for you a free and secure abode, and strengthened you with His help (through Islamic rule and power) and supplied you with sustenance of pure and wholesome things (through brotherhood, spoils of war and a free economy) so that you may give thanks to Allah (by means of absolute submission to Allah’s commands)."
Spoils of War,8,27,"O believers! Do not betray the trust of Allah and His Messenger ([blessings and peace be upon him] in paying them what is their due), nor betray your mutual trusts, whilst you know (the whole truth)."
Spoils of War,8,28,"And bear in mind that your riches and your children are nothing but a trial, and that with Allah alone lies the highest reward."
Spoils of War,8,29,"O believers! If you adopt the fear of Allah, (then) He will set for you a criterion (and guidance) to distinguish between truth and falsehood, and will wipe out your sins from your (record) and will forgive you. And Allah is the Lord of great bounty."
Spoils of War,8,30,"And when the disbelievers were engaged in hatching conspiracies against you to captivate you or slay you or banish you (from the country on the one side), they were plotting intrigues, and (on the other) Allah was planning His strategy (to thwart their intrigues). And Allah is the Best of the secret planners."
Spoils of War,8,31,"And when Our Revelations are recited to them, they say: ‘Of course, we have heard. If we desire, we can also compose Verses analogous to that (Word). These are (nothing) but the (imaginary) tales of the ancients.’"
Spoils of War,8,32,"And when they said (sarcastically): ‘O Allah! If this (Qur’an) is really the truth from Your side, then rain down upon us stones from the sky (for disobeying it), or seize us with some grievous torment.’"
Spoils of War,8,33,"And, (in truth, the matter is that) it is not Allah’s Glory to torment them, whilst you (O Venerable Beloved) are also (present) amongst them. Nor would Allah torment them whilst they are engaged in supplicating Him for forgiveness."
Spoils of War,8,34,"And what might be any other reason that Allah should not punish these (disbelievers of Mecca now after your emigration to Medina), whilst they hinder people from the Sacred Mosque (Ka‘ba), and they do not deserve to be its guardians (or custodians) as well? Its friends (i.e., guardians) are only the righteous people, but most of them do not know (this truth)."
Spoils of War,8,35,And their (so-called) Prayer at the House of Allah (Ka‘ba) is nothing more than whistling and clapping hands. So taste the torment because you used to disbelieve.
Spoils of War,8,36,"Undoubtedly, the disbelievers spend their wealth (in order to influence and) prevent people from the path of Allah’s Din (Religion). So, presently, they will continue spending it, but later (this spending) will become for them a source of regret (i.e., repentance and despondency). They will then be overpowered (by Allah’s seizure), and those who have adopted disbelief will be driven towards Hell,"
Spoils of War,8,37,"So that Allah separates the impious from the pious and puts the impious (i.e., filthy characters) one over the other and heaps them all up together and then casts this (heap) into Hell. It is they who are the losers."
Spoils of War,8,38,"Say to those who disbelieve: ‘If they desist (from their blasphemous acts), then the (sins) which have passed will be forgiven. But if they repeat the same, then the pattern of (multiple punishments given to) the forerunners has passed. (They will also be dealt with the same way.)’"
Spoils of War,8,39,"And, (O people of truth,) continue your fight against these (chieftains of oppression and terrorism for the establishment of enduring peace), until there does not (remain) any disruption and Din (the system of compliance with law) is devoted to Allah alone. And if they desist, then Allah surely sees well (the action) that they are accomplishing."
Spoils of War,8,40,"But if they turn away (from obeying Allah), then know that surely Allah alone is your Excellent Protector (i.e., Patron); what an Excellent Protector (Patron) and what an Excellent Helper!"
Spoils of War,8,41,"And bear in mind that whatever spoils of war you seize, a fifth of it is for Allah and the Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) and (the Messenger’s) kindred and orphans and the needy and the wayfarers, if you believe in Allah, and in that (Revelation) which We sent down on Our (exalted) Servant on the Day of Decision (i.e., discrimination between the truth and falsehood), the day (when) the two armies (of the believers and the disbelievers) encountered (in the battlefield of Badr). And Allah has absolute power over everything."
Spoils of War,8,42,"(Remember) when you were on the nearer bank of the valley (the Medina side) and they (the disbelievers) were on the farther bank (the other side) and (the mercantile) caravan was below you; and had you made some mutual appointment (to fight), you would certainly have reached there (at the timings) different from (your) appointment. (But Allah brought you face to face, at the same time, without any appointment.) This took place in order that Allah might lead that matter to completion, which was destined to happen, so that he who had to die might die (with a manifest) evidence to that effect, and he who had to survive might continue to live (with a manifest) evidence to that effect (i.e., the evidence be established for all on the veracity of Islam and the Holy Messenger [blessings and peace be upon him]). Allah is surely All-Hearing, All-Knowing."
Spoils of War,8,43,"(Recall) when Allah showed you in your dream (the army of) the disbelievers as small in number. And if He (Allah) had shown (them) to you as greater in number, then, (O Muslims,) you would have felt dispirited, and would have certainly disputed amongst yourselves on the question (of war). But Allah saved the Muslims (from timidity and mutual discord). Indeed, He is Well Aware of the (secrets of) hearts."
Spoils of War,8,44,"And (also remind them of the sight) when He, at the time of encounter (as well), made (the troops of) the disbelievers appear small (just) in your eyes and made you appear small in their eyes (so that both the armies might remain in a heightened state of alert) in order that Allah leads to completion the (total defeat of disbelievers resulting from the full-fledged war) preordained (by Allah). And (eventually) all matters are returned to Allah alone."
Spoils of War,8,45,"O believers! When you encounter any (enemy) army, stand firm and remember Allah abundantly so that you may attain to success."
Spoils of War,8,46,"And obey Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) and do not quarrel amongst yourselves lest (growing disunited and weak) you become timid and your impact (i.e., power) loses ground (before your enemy). So be steadfast. Surely, Allah is with those who are steadfast."
Spoils of War,8,47,And be not like those who came out of their homes exhibiting false pride and showing off to the people and who hindered (the people) from the path of Allah. And Allah has encompassed (with His Knowledge and Power) all the activities they are doing.
Spoils of War,8,48,"And (recall) when Satan made the actions of these (disbelievers) appear attractive to them, and he said (to them): ‘None of the people (can) overpower you today and I am certainly your protector (helper).’ But when both the armies stood (face to face) against each other, he turned on his heels and said: ‘I am indeed averse to you. Certainly, I see what you do not see. Surely, I fear Allah, and Allah is Severe in punishing.’"
Spoils of War,8,49,"And (also recall) when the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is the disease (of disbelief) were saying: ‘The Din (Religion) of these (Muslims) has made them greatly arrogant.’ But (the truth is that) he who trusts Allah (then Allah is the Sustainer of all his matters). Surely, Allah is Almighty, Most Wise."
Spoils of War,8,50,And you (will wonder) if you see (the spectacle) when the angels take away the souls of the disbelievers. They continue striking their faces and backs (with hammers and say): ‘Taste the torment of the Fire (of Hell).’
Spoils of War,8,51,"This (torment) is in retribution of those (impious acts) which your hands have sent forward, and Allah does not at all do injustice to His servants."
Spoils of War,8,52,"(The case of these disbelievers is also) like (that of) the people of Pharaoh and those who preceded them. They (too) denied the Revelations of Allah. So, Allah seized them (with torment) for their sins. Surely, Allah is Mighty, Severe in afflicting torment."
Spoils of War,8,53,"This (torment) is because Allah never changes any blessing that He grants affluently to some people till they change their blessed state themselves (i.e., when they commit ingratitude, disobedience and sins and even lose the sense of loss, they are seized by destruction and devastation). And Allah is indeed All-Hearing, All-Knowing."
Spoils of War,8,54,"This (torment too) is on the pattern of the people of Pharaoh and those who preceded them: they (also) denied the signs of their Lord. So, We destroyed them due to their sins, and We drowned the people of Pharaoh (in the river). And they all were oppressors."
Spoils of War,8,55,"Surely, worse than (even) all the beasts in the sight of Allah are the people who disbelieve. So they do not believe."
Spoils of War,8,56,"They are the ones from whom you took a promise (many a time), but they break their promise every time and do not fear (Allah)."
Spoils of War,8,57,"So if you come upon them in the battlefield, then by killing them (for violating the peace treaty) in an exemplary manner, make those who are behind them (also) run on their heels so that they may learn a lesson of warning."
Spoils of War,8,58,"And if you apprehend treachery from a people, then throw their promise back to them on the basis of equality. Indeed, Allah does not like the treacherous."
Spoils of War,8,59,"And let not the disbelievers ever assume that they have escaped (safe and sound). Assuredly, they can never make (Us) powerless."
Spoils of War,8,60,"And, (O Muslims,) muster up as much defence strength as you can (in the form of weapons and equipment of war) and (also formations) of war steeds (i.e., war mounts) to combat them. Cause fear with this (readiness) amongst the enemy of Allah and your enemy, and also those besides them whose (secret enmity) you know not; Allah knows them. And whatever you spend in the way of Allah, you will be paid back in full, and you will not be done any injustice."
Spoils of War,8,61,"And if they (the combatant or hostile disbelievers) incline to peace and reconciliation, you also incline to it and put your trust in Allah. Surely, He alone is All-Hearing, All-Knowing."
Spoils of War,8,62,"And if they seek to deceive you, then surely Allah is Sufficient for you. He is the One Who has given you strength with His help and with the believers."
Spoils of War,8,63,"And He (is the One Who) awakened mutual love amongst the hearts of the (Muslims). If you had spent whatever exists in the earth, you could never have inculcated this (love) in their hearts (with all these material resources). But Allah roused that love amongst them (through a spiritual relation). Allah is indeed Almighty, Most Wise."
Spoils of War,8,64,O (Glorious) Messenger! Sufficient for you is Allah and those Muslims who have committed themselves to follow in your footsteps.
Spoils of War,8,65,"O (Venerable) Messenger! Motivate the believers to fight (for the establishment of peace and human dignity). If there are twenty of you firm and steadfast (in the event of war), they will overpower two hundred (combating disbelievers), and if (one) hundred of you are (steadfast), they will overpower (one) thousand of the (invading) disbelievers because they do not understand."
Spoils of War,8,66,"Allah has, at present, lightened the burden (of His commandment) on you. He knows that there is (some degree of) weakness in you. So (now after mitigation the command is) that if there are (one) hundred resolute and steadfast (men) from amongst you, they will overpower two hundred (combating disbelievers). And if there are (one) thousand of you, they will triumph over two thousand (disbelievers) by the command of Allah, and Allah is with those who remain steadfast. (This is the target fixed for the believers which should be the minimum possible effect of the vehemence of their faith in the battlefield.)"
Spoils of War,8,67,"It is not for a Prophet that he should have (disbelievers as) prisoners of war, until he has let much of the blood of these (mischief-monger terrorist militants) in the land. You (people) desire the riches of the world, and Allah intends (prosperity in) the Hereafter, and Allah is Almighty, Most Wise."
Spoils of War,8,68,"Had there not been a prior decree (i.e., command for forgiveness) from Allah, a terrible torment would indeed have seized you for (the ransom) that you procured (from the prisoners of Badr)."
Spoils of War,8,69,"So eat of the lawful and wholesome spoils of war you have obtained and keep fearing Allah. Surely, Allah is Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful."
Spoils of War,8,70,"O Messenger! Say to the prisoners of war who are in your hands: ‘If Allah knows any good in your hearts, He will bestow on you better than that (wealth) which has been taken from you (as ransom), and He will forgive you.’ And Allah is Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful."
Spoils of War,8,71,"And (O Beloved) if they want to betray you, they have certainly betrayed Allah before this (as well). And (for the same reason) He has placed some of them under (your) authority. And Allah is All-Knowing, Most Wise."
Spoils of War,8,72,"Indeed, those who have embraced faith and have emigrated (for the cause of Allah) and have fought in the way of Allah with their material as well as human resources, and those who have provided (the Emigrants) with shelter and helped (them), it is they who are the real friends of one another. And those who have believed (but) have not emigrated (for Allah), you do not owe anything to them for their friendship till they emigrate. And if they seek help from you in (matters of) Din (Religion), it will be your duty to help them, except against a people with whom you have a (peace) treaty. And Allah is Most Vigilant to all (the works) that you are doing."
Spoils of War,8,73,"And those who disbelieve are the allies of one another. (O Muslims!) If you do not extend (to one another) the same (help and cooperation for the cause of Allah), then great mischief and disruption (for the dominance of disbelief and falsehood) will break out in the land."
Spoils of War,8,74,"And those who believed and emigrated and fought in the cause of Allah and those who provided shelter (to those who sacrificed their households and homeland in the cause of Allah) and helped (them), they are the people who are in fact true Muslims. They are the ones for whom is forgiveness and an honourable provision."
Spoils of War,8,75,"And those who believed afterwards, and left their homes (sacrificing) in the cause of truth, and joined you in fighting (in defence against the aggressing enemies who initiated and imposed war to jolt off the newly born system of social justice, peace and security), they are (also) from amongst you. And (as for inheritance and affinity with blood relations) the relatives have a higher claim on one another in the Book of Allah. Surely, Allah knows best everything."
Repentance,9,1,"Absolution (i.e., renunciation) is declared from Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) to those polytheists with whom you had made a treaty of peace (but they breached the truce and restored the state of war)."
Repentance,9,2,"So, (O polytheists,) you may move about in the land (for) four months. (You will face war after this term.) And bear in mind that you cannot at all weaken Allah, and surely Allah is the Abaser of the disbelievers."
Repentance,9,3,"(These Verses) are a (public) declaration from Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) for all mankind on the day of the Great Pilgrimage that Allah is absolved of all obligations to the polytheists, and His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) too (is free from all obligations to them). So, (O polytheists,) if you repent, that is better for you, but if you turn away, then know that you cannot at all make Allah’s strategy ineffective. And, (O Beloved,) warn the disbelievers of a grievous torment,"
Repentance,9,4,"Except those idolaters with whom you made an agreement, who then did not show any latitude (in executing the treaty) and who did not support (or reinforce) anyone against you. So fulfil the treaty with them till the end of the term. Surely, Allah loves those who fear Him."
Repentance,9,5,"So when the sacred months have passed, then (as declared) kill the idolaters (who have re-initiated war) wherever you find them (during the war), capture them, imprison them and lie in wait for them at every place of ambush (to catch and besiege them). So, if they repent, establish Prayer and start paying Zakat (the Alms-due), then leave their way open. Surely, Allah is Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful."
Repentance,9,6,"And if any of the idolaters seeks asylum with you, provide him with protection until he listens to the Words of Allah. Then escort him to his haven. This is because these people do not possess the knowledge (of the truth)."
Repentance,9,7,"(How) can there be a promise for the polytheists with Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) except for those with whom you have made a treaty near the Sacred Mosque (at al-Hudaybiya)? So as long as they remain true to (the treaty with) you, remain true to them. Surely, Allah loves those who fear Him."
Repentance,9,8,"How (can one expect from them an honouring of the agreement)? They are in such a state that if they overpower you, they will have regard neither for any tie of kinship with you nor for any covenant. They please you with lip service only, but their hearts deny (all what they say). And most of them are those who break agreements."
Repentance,9,9,"They gained a paltry price (in terms of worldly interests) for the Revelations of Allah and then started hindering (people) from His path (of the Din [Religion]). Indeed, it is extremely evil what they keep doing."
Repentance,9,10,"They have no regard for either a tie of kinship or a covenant in respect of a Muslim, and they are the people who have exceeded limits (in disobedience)."
Repentance,9,11,"(Even) then if they repent and establish Prayer and pay Zakat (the Alms-due), they are your brothers in Din (Religion). And We elucidate (Our) Revelations in detail for those who possess knowledge and understanding."
Repentance,9,12,"And if after making a promise (for peaceful bilateral relations), they break their oaths, (and restore the state of war,) and taunt you with sarcasm in your Din (Religion), then wage (defensive) war against (those) chieftains of disbelief (to eliminate any chance of mischief, violence and revolt). Surely, their oaths are not worth any regard, so that they may desist (from their mischief-mongering)."
Repentance,9,13,"Will you not fight a people who broke their oaths (violating the peace treaty and restoring the state of war), and decided to banish the Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) whilst the first time it is they who initiated war against you? Do you fear them? But Allah has more right that you should fear Him, provided you are believers."
Repentance,9,14,"Fight against them (to establish peace). Allah will torment them at your hands and will humiliate them, and will help you (in your defensive fight) against them, and will heal the breasts of the believers."
Repentance,9,15,"And He will remove the distress and fury in their hearts, and will accept repentance of whom He wills. And Allah is All-Knowing, Most Wise."
Repentance,9,16,"Do you think that you will be spared (without passing through troubles and hardships), whilst Allah has not (yet) made distinctly known those amongst you who have fought in the way of Allah and (who) have not taken anyone as a confidant besides Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) and the believers? And Allah is Well Aware of the deeds that you do."
Repentance,9,17,"It is not for the polytheists to maintain and frequent the mosques of Allah, whereas they themselves bear witness to their disbelief. All their deeds have become void and in Hell they shall dwell forever."
Repentance,9,18,Only he who believes in Allah and the Last Day and establishes Prayer and pays Zakat (the Alms-due) and who fears none but Allah can maintain and frequent the mosques of Allah. So they alone are expected to become the rightly-guided.
Repentance,9,19,"Do you consider (the mere) serving of drinking water to the pilgrims and the management of populating and maintaining the Sacred Mosque (an act) equal to (the works of) a person who believes in Allah and the Last Day and fights in the cause of Allah? They cannot be equal in the sight of Allah, and Allah does not guide those who do injustice."
Repentance,9,20,"Those who have believed and have emigrated and have consistently toiled hard in the cause of Allah with their material and human resources enjoy a very high rank in the presence of Allah, and it is they who have achieved the ultimate goal."
Repentance,9,21,Their Lord gives them glad tidings of mercy from Him and of (His) pleasure and of (those) Gardens for them in which there are eternal delights;
Repentance,9,22,"They will reside therein forever. Surely, with Allah is the mighty reward."
Repentance,9,23,"O believers! Do not take your fathers (and forefathers) and brothers for friends if they love disbelief more than belief. And whoever of you befriends them, it is they who are the wrongdoers."
Repentance,9,24,"(O Esteemed Messenger!) Say: ‘If your fathers (and forefathers) and your sons (and daughters) and your brothers (and sisters) and your wives and your (other) kith and kin and the riches that you have earned (so hard) and the trade and business that you fear may decline and the homes you are fond of are dearer to you than Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) and struggling in His cause, then wait until Allah brings His command (of torment). And Allah does not guide the disobedient.’"
Repentance,9,25,"Assuredly, Allah has helped you on a great many occasions, and (in particular) on the day of Hunayn, when the superiority of your (numerical strength) exhilarated you. Then that (numerical superiority) could not prove to you of any avail, and the earth, despite its vast expanse, narrowed for you, and then you turned your backs in retreat."
Repentance,9,26,"Allah then sent down His tranquillity (i.e., mercy) upon His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) and the believers and sent down (such) armies (of angels) that you could not see. And He tormented those who were engaged in disbelief; and that is the punishment of the disbelievers."
Repentance,9,27,"Then even after this, Allah accepts repentance of the one He wills (i.e., He blesses him with an aptness for Islam and His Merciful Eye). And Allah is Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful."
Repentance,9,28,"O believers! The polytheists are an embodiment of impurity, so let them not come closer to the Sacred Mosque after this year of theirs (i.e., after victory over Mecca in 9 AH). If you fear poverty (due to a decline in your trade), then (do not worry). Allah will soon enrich you from His bounty if He so wills. Surely, Allah is All-Knowing, Most Wise."
Repentance,9,29,"(O Muslims!) Wage (also a defensive) war against those of the People of the Book who (infringed the peace treaty signed with you, and despite being in exile, provided full support to the disbelieving Meccan invaders who imposed the battle of al-Ahzab [the Confederates] on Medina, and have continued every possible conspiracy against you even now). They do not have faith in Allah and the Last Day, and do not consider unlawful the things Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) have declared unlawful, and do not adopt the true Din ([Religion] of Islam) until they give in and surrender (to the command of Islam), and pay the capitation tax with their own hands after having been subdued."
Repentance,9,30,"And the Jews said: ‘‘Uzayr (Ezra) is the son of Allah,’ and the Christians said: ‘The Messiah is the son of Allah.’ These are their (absurd) utterances that they voice with their mouths. They (acquire) resemblance with the saying of those who have disbelieved before (them). May Allah ruin them! Where are they wandering distracted?"
Repentance,9,31,"They took their priests and monks for lords besides Allah and (also) the Messiah, the son of Maryam (Mary), whilst in truth they had not been given (any) command except to worship (only) the One God besides Whom there is no God. Holy is He, far above those that they associate with Him as partners."
Repentance,9,32,"They desire to extinguish the Light of Allah by blowing through their mouths. And Allah rejects (it) but (wills) to manifest His Light to its fullness, even though the disbelievers dislike (it)."
Repentance,9,33,"Allah is He Who sent His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) with guidance and the Din (Religion) of truth to make him (the Messenger) dominant over every (other exponent of) Din (Religion), though much to the dislike of the polytheists."
Repentance,9,34,"O believers! Indeed, the majority of the priests and monks (of the People of the Book) devour the wealth of people through unfair (means) and hinder from the path of Allah (i.e., fill their safes with people’s money, and hinder it from being spent for the publicity and promotion of the true Din [Religion]). And those who hoard silver and gold and do not spend it in the cause of Allah, warn them of a grievous torment."
Repentance,9,35,"The Day when this (gold, silver and wealth) will be heated in the Fire of Hell, their foreheads, sides and backs will be branded with this (heated material, and it will be said to them:) ‘This is the same (wealth) that you treasured for (the benefit of) your souls. So taste (this wealth) which you had been amassing.’"
Repentance,9,36,"Indeed, the number of months with Allah has been (inscribed as) twelve in the Book of Allah (i.e., permanent Law of Nature) since the day He created the (system of) the heavens and the earth. Of these, four months (Rajab, Dhu al-Qa‘da, Dhu al-Hijja and Muharram) are sacred. This is the right Din (Religion). So do not wrong your souls during these months (by involving yourselves in fighting and war), and fight against all the idolaters (in retaliation) the same way as they all (allied) have imposed war upon all of you, and bear in mind that Allah is surely with the Godfearing."
Repentance,9,37,"Postponing and deferring (the sacred months) is just an addition to disbelief. By this, the disbelievers are led astray; they, in one year, count it lawful and in another year regard it forbidden to complete the count (of the months) which Allah has made sacred and (they also) make that (month) lawful which Allah has declared unlawful. Their evil deeds have been made attractive to them, and Allah does not guide the community of disbelievers."
Repentance,9,38,"O believers! What is the matter with you that when you are asked to set out (to fight) in the way of Allah, you, weighing heavier, incline towards (the material and ignoble world of) the earth? Are you pleased with the life of this world rather than the Hereafter? So, the property and belongings of the life of this world are worthless in (comparison with) the Hereafter (and carry) but little (value)."
Repentance,9,39,"If you do not move out (to fight for the promotion of peace and human dignity), He will afflict you with grievous torment and will replace you with another people and you will not be able to do Him any harm. And Allah has mighty power over everything."
Repentance,9,40,"If you do not help him (the Holy Messenger of Allah in the struggle for the dominance of Islam, then what!). Indeed, Allah helped him (also at the time) when the disbelievers drove him away (from Mecca, his homeland,) whilst he was the second of the two (emigrants). Both (the Messenger [blessings and peace be upon him] and Abu Bakr) were in the cave (of Mount Thawr) when he said to his Companion (Abu Bakr): ‘Do not grieve. Allah is surely with us.’ So, Allah sent down His serenity upon him, and strengthened him by means of such armies (of angels) that you could not see, and He made the word of the disbelievers the lowermost, and Allah’s Word is (always) the uppermost and exalted. And Allah is Almighty, Most Wise."
Repentance,9,41,"Light or heavy, march forth (under all circumstances) and fight in the cause of Allah with your material and human resources. It is better for you if you are (reality) conscious."
Repentance,9,42,"Had the benefit (i.e., spoils of war) been a near gain and the journey (of fighting) easy and moderate, then they (the hypocrites) would certainly have followed you. But (that) arduous journey appeared to them far too long. And they will (now) swear by Allah soon: ‘Had we been able to go, we would certainly have marched forth with you.’ They are drawing upon themselves (added) destruction (by these lies), and Allah knows that they are liars beyond doubt."
Repentance,9,43,"Allah safeguard (protect and exalt) you! Why did you permit them (not to participate in war), till those who were speaking the truth would be known to you and you would (also) know the liars?"
Repentance,9,44,Those who believe in Allah and the Last Day will not seek from you (this) permission that they should (not) fight with their possessions and lives. And Allah knows the Godfearing full well.
Repentance,9,45,"Only those who do not believe in Allah and the Last Day and whose hearts are in doubt will seek leave (i.e., exemption from fighting) from you. So in their doubt they are bewildered, lost in disorientation."
Repentance,9,46,"If they had (really) resolved to go forth (for fighting), they would have procured (at least some) equipment for that. But (the fact is that owing to their falsehood and hypocrisy) Allah disliked (even) their rising up (for fighting). So, He stopped them (there). And it was said to them: ‘Sit in the company of those who sit (shirking from the fight).’"
Repentance,9,47,"If they had come out (joining you), they would have added nothing to you except mischief and disorder and would have strived hard amongst you (to stir up disaffection and discord). They want to bring about subversion within you, and (even now some of) their spies are there amongst you. And Allah is Well Aware of the wrongdoers."
Repentance,9,48,"The truth is that they have been trying to cause subversion earlier too, and have been contriving schemes to upset your programmes until the truth came and the decree of Allah prevailed, though they disliked (it) downright."
Repentance,9,49,"And amongst them is (also) he who says: ‘Accord me permission (to stay back home instead of going to fight) and put me not into trial.’ Listen, they have plunged (themselves) into trial, and assuredly Hell has encompassed the disbelievers."
Repentance,9,50,"If some good (or some comfort) betides you, it grieves them, but if some adversity (or trouble) befalls you, then they say: ‘We had adopted (precaution in) our work in advance,’ and they turn away, rejoicing."
Repentance,9,51,(O Beloved!) Say: ‘Never shall (anything) befall us but what Allah has decreed for us; He alone is our Protector. And in Allah alone the believers should put their trust.’
Repentance,9,52,"Say: ‘Are you simply waiting for one of the two good fortunes in our favour (i.e., victory or martyrdom: whether we are martyred or return victorious)? And we are waiting in your favour (in view of your hypocrisy) to see Allah afflict you with a (special) torment either from Himself or at our hands. So wait. We (too) are waiting with you (to see whose wait proves productive).’"
Repentance,9,53,"Say: ‘Spend willingly or unwillingly, this (money) will not be accepted from you at all. You are indeed a disobedient people.’"
Repentance,9,54,"And there is nothing that stands in the way of acceptance of their spending (i.e., charity donations) except that they deny Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) and come to offer Prayer but lazily and unwillingly, and (also) they do not spend (in the cause of Allah) except in a state of displeasure."
Repentance,9,55,So neither their wealth nor their children should amaze you. It is for these (things) only that Allah intends to punish them in the life of this world and that their souls may depart whilst they are in a state of disbelief.
Repentance,9,56,And (they are so cowardly that) they swear by Allah that they are from you whilst they are not from you. But they are those who fear (the disclosure and outcome of their hypocrisy. So they appear to be Muslims outawardly).
Repentance,9,57,"(Their state of mind is such that) if they could find a place of refuge or a cave or a crevice in the earth, they would turn towards it running very fast (and would not stay with you even for a moment, but they are under compulsion right now so they show off their false loyalty)."
Repentance,9,58,"And some amongst them are those who pass sarcastic remarks against you in the matter of (the distribution of) alms. If they are given some portion of (the alms), they feel pleased, but if nothing is given to them, they feel annoyed at once."
Repentance,9,59,"How good it would have been if they had felt pleased with what Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) had given them and said: ‘Sufficient for us is Allah. Allah will soon confer on us His bounty and so will His Messenger ([blessings and peace be upon him] in addition). Indeed, we are inclined to Allah alone.’ (And the Messenger [blessings and peace be upon him] is His mediator; in fact, his bestowal is Allah’s. Had they developed this belief and refrained from sarcasm, it would have been better.)"
Repentance,9,60,"Indeed, alms (Zakat) are meant for the poor and the indigent, and those who are deployed to collect charities and those in whose hearts the inculcation of love for Islam is aimed at. And, (moreover, spending Zakat for the) freeing of human lives (from the yoke of slavery) and removing the burden of those who are to pay debt and (those who toil hard) in the cause of Allah and the wayfarers (is true). This (all) has been prescribed by Allah, and Allah is All-Knowing, Most Wise."
Repentance,9,61,"And amongst these (hypocrites) are also those who hurt (the Esteemed) Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) and say: ‘He is only an ear (believes everything he hears).’ Say: ‘He is all ears to what is good for you; he believes in Allah and has faith in (what) the believers (say) and is mercy for those of you who have embraced faith. And those who hurt the Messenger of Allah (by means of their evil beliefs, doubts and foul statements), for them there is grievous torment.’"
Repentance,9,62,"O Muslims! They (the hypocrites) swear by Allah in your presence to keep you pleased, whereas Allah along with His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) has a greater right that they should please Him. If they are the believers, (they should have known this fact and should have pleased the Messenger [blessings and peace be upon him]. Allah is pleased only if the Messenger [blessings and peace be upon him] is pleased because their pleasure is but one and the same)."
Repentance,9,63,"Do they not know that he who opposes Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him), the Fire of Hell is (destined) for him wherein he will dwell forever? There is no humiliation greater than this."
Repentance,9,64,"The hypocrites feel scared that a Sura (Chapter) will be sent down to the Muslims, and that will make them aware of those matters that are (hidden) in the hearts (of the hypocrites). Say: ‘Continue mocking. Surely, Allah is about to reveal that (matter) which you are scared of.’"
Repentance,9,65,"If you ask them, they will certainly say: ‘We only used to talk (away the journey) and enjoy.’ Say: ‘Were you mocking Allah, His Revelations and His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him)?’"
Repentance,9,66,"(Now) do not make excuses. You have certainly become disbelievers after (showing that) you believed. If We forgive a party of you, (even then) We shall torment the other party because they sinned."
Repentance,9,67,"The hypocrites, men and women, are one from another (alike). They command evil and forbid good and are close-fisted (in the matter of spending in the cause of Allah). They have forgotten Allah, so Allah has forgotten them. It is indeed the hypocrites who are disobedient."
Repentance,9,68,"Allah has promised the hypocrites, men and women, and the disbelievers, the Fire of Hell in which (they) will live forever. That (Fire) will suffice them. And Allah has cast His curse upon them, and for them is a torment that will last forever."
Repentance,9,69,"(O hypocrites!) You are like those who preceded you. They were far mightier than you in power and far richer in possessions and progeny. They benefited by their share (of the world); so are you (too) enjoying your portion (the same way) as your predecessors enjoyed their fixed share (of the worldly pleasures). Moreover, you (in like manner) have deeply indulged in falsehood as they deeply indulged in falsehood. Their works have gone fruitless in this world and in the Hereafter, and they are the ones who are the losers."
Repentance,9,70,"Has the news not reached them of those who were before them—the people of Nuh (Noah), ‘Ad and Thamud and the people of Ibrahim (Abraham) and the citizens of Madyan and the dwellers of the towns which were overturned? Their Messengers (too) came to them with clear signs (but they disobeyed). So, it was not Allah’s glory to wrong them, but it was they who used to wrong themselves (because of rejecting the truth)."
Repentance,9,71,"The believers, men and women, are helpers and friends to one another. They command good and forbid evil and establish Prayer and pay Zakat (the Alms-due) and obey Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him). It is they on whom Allah will soon shower His Mercy. Surely, Allah is Almighty, Most Wise."
Repentance,9,72,"Allah has promised the believers, men and women, Gardens with streams flowing beneath. They will dwell therein forever. And (He has also promised) blessed mansions located at a special site in Paradise amidst evergreen Gardens, and (then) the greatest (bliss of all) is the pleasure and acceptance of Allah (which will be awarded as a mighty compensation). This indeed is the highest achievement."
Repentance,9,73,"O (Glorious) Messenger! Fight against the disbelievers and the hypocrites, and treat them harshly (for violating peace, creating disorder and committing militancy and aggression). And Hell is their abode and that is an evil abode."
Repentance,9,74,"(These hypocrites) swear by Allah that they have not said (anything), whereas they have definitely uttered blasphemy and have become disbelievers after (showing) their belief in Islam. They intended (many tortures too) that they could not achieve. And (out of Islam and the Messenger’s conduct) they could not disdain anything, except that Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) had made them affluent with His bounty. So if they repent (even now), it will be better for them, but if they remain averse (the same way), then Allah will afflict them with grievous torment, (both) in (the life of) this world and in the Hereafter, and they will not have any helper or friend on earth."
Repentance,9,75,"And amongst these (hypocrites) are also (some) who made a promise with Allah: ‘If He bestows upon us (riches) out of His bounty, we shall certainly give alms (in His way) and become of the righteous.’"
Repentance,9,76,"So when He conferred on them (wealth) out of His bounty, they became miserly with it and turned back, retracting (from their promise)."
Repentance,9,77,"So He made hypocrisy in their hearts a consequence (of their own niggardliness) till the Day when they would meet Him, because they violated the promise they had made with Allah and (also) because they used to tell lies."
Repentance,9,78,Do they not know that Allah is aware of their secrets and their whisperings and that Allah knows best all unseen things?
Repentance,9,79,"The people who accuse (of pretentiousness and compulsion) those of the believers who give alms happily and willingly in (their) charity works, and also (blame) those (destitute Muslims) who find nothing (more to give) except for their toil and hard work, and (also) mock their (sentiment for spending in the cause of Allah), Allah will punish them for their scoffing, and there is for them a grievous punishment."
Repentance,9,80,"Whether or not you seek forgiveness for these (wicked and arrogant hypocrites who dare scoff at Your Eminence), if you implore forgiveness for them seventy times (out of your natural compassion and your benevolent practice of forgiving and forbearing), even then Allah will not forgive them at all because they have rejected Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) and Allah does not guide the rebels."
Repentance,9,81,(These hypocrites) who stayed back (from fighting) due to opposing Allah’s Messenger are rejoicing over their sitting behind. They disliked it that they should strive in the cause of Allah with their wealth and their lives and said: ‘Do not move out in this heat.’ Say: ‘The Fire of Hell is far fiercer in heat.’ (How good it would be) if they could only understand!
Repentance,9,82,So they should laugh for a while and weep for long (because they will have to weep for long in the Hereafter) as a recompense for what they used to earn.
Repentance,9,83,"So, (O Beloved,) if Allah again takes you back to a party of these (hypocrites, when you are free from the battle of Tabuk,) and they seek your permission to go forth (to fight in the event of a future conflict), then say to them: ‘(Now) you shall never go forth with me, nor shall you ever accompany me to fight an enemy (because, abandoning the sacred struggle,) you rejoiced over sitting behind the first time. So, (this time as well,) stay behind along with those who remain behind.’"
Repentance,9,84,"And never perform (funeral) Prayer over any of these (hypocrites) who dies, nor stand at his grave (because your stepping on some place also brings about mercy and blessings, and they do not deserve your mercy and blessing). Indeed, they disbelieved in Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) and died in a state of defiance."
Repentance,9,85,"Let not their riches and their progeny make you wonder. Allah wants only to torment them in this world (too) by means of these things, and that their souls may depart whilst they are (still) disbelievers."
Repentance,9,86,"And when (such) a Sura (Chapter) is revealed: ‘Believe in Allah and fight in the cause of Allah along with His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him),’ the affluent and the influential amongst them seek leave from you and say: ‘Leave us. We shall remain with those who sit (behind).’"
Repentance,9,87,"They liked that they would be with those women, children and the handicapped who would stay behind. And their hearts have been sealed, so they do not understand anything."
Repentance,9,88,"But the Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) and those who believed with him fight in the cause of Allah with their material and human resources. And for them are all good things, and they are the ones who will achieve their goal."
Repentance,9,89,Allah has prepared for them Gardens beneath which streams flow. They are their permanent residents. This indeed is a colossal achievement.
Repentance,9,90,"And a few feigners from amongst the desert nomads came (to the Holy Messenger [blessings and peace be upon him] to submit their excuse) so that they might (also) be accorded permission, and those who lied to Allah and His Messenger (in their claim to be the believers) stayed behind (having forsaken the fight). Those of them who denied the truth will soon be seized by a painful torment."
Repentance,9,91,"There is no sin on the aged (i.e., the weak) and the sick, nor on those who are not so (affluent) that they may spend, while they are most sincerely and truly devoted to Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him). No way can the righteous (i.e., the spiritually excellent) be blamed and Allah is Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful."
Repentance,9,92,"Nor can (anyway be scoffed or blamed) those who presented themselves to your service (with the purpose) that you may arrange for them mounts (for fighting, because they did not possess any means of conveyance). So you said: ‘I (also) do not find any (additional means) to mount you on.’ Then (with your permission) they returned in such a state that their eyes were streaming with tears in grief (of being deprived of fighting in the cause of Allah: Alas!) They did not have (much) wealth, which they could spend (and manage to take part in the sacred fight)."
Repentance,9,93,"(Blame) lies only on those who seek your permission though they are affluent. They feel pleased to remain with the women and the handicapped who stay behind. Allah has sealed their hearts, so they do not understand (what the true loss or gain is)."
Repentance,9,94,"(O Muslims!) When you return to them (from the expedition of Tabuk), they will offer their apologies to you. (O Beloved!) Say: ‘Do not make excuses; we will not believe you at all. Allah has informed us about your state of affairs. Now (in the future) Allah as well as His Messenger will see your performance (in the world). Then (in the Hereafter too) you will be returned to (the Lord) Who knows everything hidden and manifest, and He will make you know (all your works) that you used to do.’"
Repentance,9,95,"Now they will swear to you by Allah, when you return to them, so that you may excuse them. So be indifferent to them. Surely, they are unclean and Hell is their abode, a reward for what they used to earn."
Repentance,9,96,"They swear to you so that you may feel pleased with them. So, (O Muslims,) if you are pleased with them, (even) then Allah will not be pleased with the disobedient people."
Repentance,9,97,"(These) nomad villagers are unyielding disbelievers and incorrigible hypocrites. And (due to their stubbornness in disbelief and hypocrisy) they deserve to remain ignorant of those limits and commandments which Allah has sent down to His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him). And Allah is All-Knowing, Most Wise."
Repentance,9,98,"And amongst these nomad villagers there is (also) one who regards that (money) which he spends (in the cause of Allah) as a compulsory fine, and looks forward to the spinning evil (of miseries and misfortunes) coming upon you. But it is they whom the evil spin (of calamity and ill-fortune) is going to whirl. And Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing."
Repentance,9,99,"And (yet) amongst these nomads there is (also) one who believes in Allah and the Last Day and considers whatever he spends (in the way of Allah) as a means of nearness to Allah and receiving (the merciful) supplications of the Messenger. Listen! Assuredly, it is a source of nearness to Allah. Allah will soon admit them to His mercy. Surely, Allah is Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful."
Repentance,9,100,"And the Emigrants and their Supporters (Ansar), the vanguard of the believers, and those who follow them in the grade of spiritual excellence—Allah is well-pleased with them (all) and they (all) are well-pleased with Him. And He has prepared for them Gardens with rivers flowing under them. They will live in them forever. This is indeed a colossal achievement."
Repentance,9,101,"And, (O Muslims,) some amongst the nomad villagers around you and some citizens of Medina as well are hypocrites. They are adamant about hypocrisy. (So far) you know them not; We know them. (Later, the Holy Messenger [blessings and peace be upon him] was also given the knowledge and awareness of all the hypocrites.) Soon shall We torment them twice* (here in this world). Then they will be turned towards a greater torment (on the Day of Rising)."
Repentance,9,102,"And there are others (who) have confessed their sins. They have mixed up good deeds with some bad ones (by mistake). Allah will, most likely, accept their repentance. Surely, Allah is Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful."
Repentance,9,103,"Collect alms (Zakat—the Alms-due) from their wealth so that by these (alms) you may purify them (of their sins) and (by this purification of faith and riches) bestow upon them blessing and pray for them. Surely, your prayer is a (source of) delightful calm for them. And Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing."
Repentance,9,104,"Do they not know that indeed He is Allah alone Who accepts the repentance of His servants and takes charity donations (i.e., Zakat and alms with His own Mighty Hand) and that Allah is the One Who is Oft-Relenting, Ever-Merciful?"
Repentance,9,105,And say: ‘Work. Allah as well as His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) and the believers (too) will soon see your work. And you will shortly be returned to (the Lord) Who knows everything veiled and unveiled. So He will inform you of the works that you used to do.’
Repentance,9,106,"And there are (yet) others who are deferred, left to the (next) command of Allah. He will either torment them or accept their repentance. And Allah is All-Knowing, Most Wise."
Repentance,9,107,"And (from amongst the hypocrites there are also those) who have erected a mosque to harm (the Muslims) and (promote) disbelief and disunite the believers, and as an ambush for the one who is already at war against Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him). They will surely swear: ‘We have intended nothing but good (by constructing this mosque).’ And Allah bears witness that they are certainly liars."
Repentance,9,108,"(O Beloved!) Never stand in this (building which has been built in the name of a mosque). But the mosque which has been, from the very first day, founded on the fear of Allah has greater right to be honoured with your standing in it. There are people in it who love to remain purified (both physically and spiritually), and Allah loves those who commit themselves to purity."
Repentance,9,109,"Who is better—the one who founds his edifice (i.e., mosque) on the fear of Allah and (His) pleasure and satisfaction, or the one who lays the foundation of his building on the edge of a crumbling precipice? So, that (building) tumbled down with its architect into the Fire of Hell. And Allah does not guide the wrongdoers."
Repentance,9,110,"Their structure which they have raised (in the name of a mosque) will continue pricking their hearts (due to doubt and hypocrisy), except that their hearts are torn to pieces (due to persistently piercing concerns). And Allah is All-Knowing, Most Wise."
Repentance,9,111,"Surely, Allah has bought from the believers their souls and wealth in return for (the promise of) Paradise for them. (Now) they fight (for the noble cause of peace) in the way of Allah. So they kill (during the war) and are slain (themselves) too. (Allah has taken) the firm promise as a bountiful obligation on Him in the Torah, the Gospel (the Injil) and the Qur’an. And who is truer to his promise than Allah? So, (believers,) rejoice over your bargain against which you have sold (your souls and wealth). This is a colossal achievement."
Repentance,9,112,"(These believers who have bargained with Allah for the Hereafter are those) who turn to Allah in repentance, and who worship, praise and glorify (Allah), and fast, abstaining from the worldly lusts, and bow down before Him (most humbly and submissively), and who prostrate themselves before Him (seeking His nearness), command good and forbid evil, and guard the limits (set) by Allah. And give glad tidings to these believers."
Repentance,9,113,"It is not the glory of the Prophet (blessings and peace be upon him) and the dignity of the believers that they pray for the forgiveness of the polytheists, even though they are kindred, after it has become clear to them that they (the polytheists) are the inmates of Hell."
Repentance,9,114,"And Ibrahim’s (Abraham’s) praying for his father’s (i.e., Azar, his uncle who brought him up) forgiveness was only due to the promise that he had made to him. But when it became evident to him that he was an enemy of Allah, he parted with him (dissociated himself from him and never prayed for him afterwards). Surely, Ibrahim (Abraham) was most compassionate (tender-hearted, tearful) and profoundly forbearing."
Repentance,9,115,"And it is not Allah’s Glory to lead a people astray after guiding them aright, until He makes clear to them the things which they should guard against. Surely, Allah knows everything best."
Repentance,9,116,"Verily, He is Allah to Whom belongs the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth. He (is the One Who) gives life and causes death. And besides Allah, there is for you no friend or helper (who can support you against Allah’s command)."
Repentance,9,117,"Surely, Allah turned in His mercy towards the Prophet (blessings and peace be upon him) and (also) towards the Emigrants and the Helpers who followed him (even) in the hour of distress (of the battle of Tabuk), after (the situation emerged wherein) the hearts of a party of them had nearly deviated. Then He turned towards them with bestowal and mercy. Allah is indeed Most Compassionate and Ever-Merciful towards them."
Repentance,9,118,"And (He also turned towards) those three persons (with merciful compassion) whose (decision) was deferred until, when the earth, despite all its vastness, closed in upon them, and their (own) souls (too) became cumbersome for them, and they knew for sure that there is no refuge from (the torment of) Allah except in (turning towards) Him. Allah then inclined towards them in bestowal and kindness so that they (too) might persevere with repentance and inclination. Surely, Allah is the One Who is Most Relenting, Ever-Merciful."
Repentance,9,119,"O believers! Fear Allah persistently, and remain in the (company) of those who uphold the truth."
Repentance,9,120,"It was unbecoming the people of Medina and the villagers (inhabitants) of the suburbs to lag behind (stepping aside from) Allah’s Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him), nor to feel for their own souls greater concern than his (blessed and sacred) soul. This (command) is because in the cause of Allah (whatever) thirst they suffer, (whatever) turmoil they undergo, (whatever) hunger they endure, and stepping on a track where treading rouses violent reaction amongst the disbelievers, and whatever they receive from the enemy (killing and injury or spoils of war): in recompense of everything is recorded a good deed to their credit. Surely, Allah does not waste the reward of the righteous."
Repentance,9,121,"They (who fight in the cause of Allah) do not spend any amount, small or great, nor do they journey through a valley, but that (all this expense and journey) is written down for them so that Allah confers on them the best reward (for every such act) they used to do."
Repentance,9,122,"And it is not possible for all the Muslims to set out (together). So, why should a party from within every group (or tribe) not go forth in order that they may acquire deeper knowledge (i.e., thorough understanding and insight) of the Din (Religion), and warn their people when they return to them so that they may guard themselves (against a life of sins and disobedience)?"
Repentance,9,123,"O believers! Fight against those of the disbelievers who are around you (i.e., who are directly involved in hostilities and terrorist activities against you). And (fight in a way and at a time that) they find in you toughness (of might, valour and defensive capability). And bear in mind that Allah is with those who guard themselves against evil."
Repentance,9,124,"And whenever a Sura (Chapter) is revealed, some of these (hypocrites) say (mischievously): ‘Whose faith amongst you has this (Sura) increased?’ So, this (Sura) has increased the faith of those who have embraced faith and they rejoice (over this boosted state of faith)."
Repentance,9,125,"But as for those whose hearts are diseased, this (Sura) has added vileness (and impurity) to their filth (disbelief and hypocrisy). And they died as disbelievers."
Repentance,9,126,"Do they not see that they are put in trouble once or twice every year? (Even) then they do not repent, nor do they take advice."
Repentance,9,127,"Whenever a Sura (Chapter) is revealed, they look at one another (and inquire through body language:) ‘Is there anyone watching you?’ Then they turn away. Allah has turned their hearts away because they are the ones who lack understanding."
Repentance,9,128,"Surely, a (Glorious) Messenger from amongst yourselves has come to you. Your suffering and distress (becomes) grievously heavy on him (blessings and peace be upon him). (O mankind,) he is ardently desirous of your (betterment and guidance. And) he is most (deeply) clement and merciful to the believers."
Repentance,9,129,"If (in spite of all these favours and blessings) they (still) deviate, then say: ‘Enough for me is Allah. There is no God but He. I have reposed my trust in Him alone, and He is the Lord of the Mighty Throne.’"
Jonah,10,1,"Alif, Lam, Ra. (Only Allah and the Messenger [blessings and peace be upon him] know the real meaning). These are the Verses of the Book which is all wisdom."
Jonah,10,2,"Is it amazing for the people that We sent down Revelation to a (perfect) man from amongst themselves: ‘Warn (the disoriented and distracted) people (of Allah’s torment), and give glad tidings to the believers that there is high rank (i.e., exalted status) for them in the presence of their Lord’? The disbelievers said: ‘Indeed, this person is an evident magician.’"
Jonah,10,3,"Certainly, your Lord is Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth (the upper and lower strata of the universe) in six days (i.e., aeons or phases, step by step). Then He established His sovereignty on the Throne (befitting His Glory with His supreme authority, i.e., after the creation of the universe He established His command and control by enforcing His law and system in all the worlds and heavenly bodies). He is the One Who devises strategies for all operations (i.e., makes everything function under a system). There is no one to intercede (with Him) without His permission. (The Glorious and Mighty) Allah is the One Who is your Lord; worship Him alone. So, do you not think (about accepting His direction and guidance)?"
Jonah,10,4,"(O people!) It is to Him that you are all to return; (that) is Allah’s true promise. Surely, He is the One Who originates the creation. Then He is the One Who will repeat it so that He rewards with justice those who believe and do righteous works. And those who reject faith and disbelieve, there is for them scalding water to drink and a painful torment, a reward for their disbelief."
Jonah,10,5,"He is the One Who has made the sun (a source of) light and (with that) made the moon luminous, and appointed for it stages (to appear smaller or bigger) so that you might compute the number of years and the count (of time). Allah has not created (all this) but with a zero-defect strategy. (Through these cosmic realities) He expounds in detail the signs (of His creativity, unicity and might) for those who possess knowledge."
Jonah,10,6,"Surely, in the alternation of night and day and in (all) that Allah has created in the heavens and the earth, there are (in like manner) signs for those who live by Godwariness."
Jonah,10,7,"Verily, those who do not expect to meet Us and are pleased with the worldly life and are well-contented with it and who are neglectful of Our signs,"
Jonah,10,8,"It is they whose abode is Hell, a recompense for the deeds they used to earn."
Jonah,10,9,"Indeed, those who believe and consistently practise piety, their Lord will take them, for their faith, (to the Gardens) with streams flowing (under their abodes, located) in the Gardens of Bliss in the Hereafter."
Jonah,10,10,"(Finding these blessings and bounties,) they will pray in these (Gardens): ‘Holy You are, O Allah!’ And the word of their mutual greetings will be: ‘Peace.’ (Or the word for their reception from Allah and the angels will be: ‘Peace.’) And their supplication will end (with these words): ‘All praise belongs to Allah, the Lord of all the worlds.’"
Jonah,10,11,"If Allah were to hasten evil (i.e., torment) for the (disbelieving) people, as they make haste for the worldly gains, then certainly their term (of life) would have been (hastily) completed for them (so that they reach Hell fast after dying). But We leave those who do not expect to meet Us in their rebellion (and revolt) so that they keep wandering disoriented."
Jonah,10,12,"And when a misery touches (such a) man, he calls out to Us whilst lying on his side or sitting or standing. But when We remove from him his affliction, he passes on (forgetting Us) as if he (never) called out to Us in the pain that had touched him. This is how the (wrong) deeds which the transgressors do are made to appear to them fascinating."
Jonah,10,13,"And indeed, before you We (also) destroyed (a number of) communities when they perpetrated injustice. And their Messengers brought to them clear signs, but they would not believe. That is how We punish the evildoers (for their impious behaviour)."
Jonah,10,14,"Then, after them, We made you (their) successors in the land so that We might observe how you would behave (now)."
Jonah,10,15,"And when Our enlightening Verses are recited to them, those who do not believe in meeting Us say: ‘Bring us a Qur’an different from this one or alter it.’ (O Glorious Messenger,) say: ‘I have no right to modify it of my own accord. I follow only (that) which is revealed to me. Indeed, I fear the chastisement of the Mighty Day if I go against my Lord.’"
Jonah,10,16,"Say: ‘Had Allah so willed, I would not have recited this (Qur’an) to you, nor would He (Himself) have made it known to you. I have indeed spent a (part of) life amongst you (even) before this (revelation of the Qur’an). So do you not understand?’"
Jonah,10,17,"So who is more unjust than one who fabricates lies against Allah or belies His Revelations? Certainly, the evildoers will never triumph."
Jonah,10,18,"And (the idolaters) worship, apart from Allah, those (idols) which can neither harm nor benefit them, and (in justification of their false worship) they say: ‘These (idols) are our intercessors with Allah.’ Say: ‘Do you seek to inform Allah of the (fabricated) presumption (of intercession by idols) whose (existence) He is not aware of either in the heavens or in the earth (i.e., intercession with Him by any idol is not in His knowledge)? Holy is He, and far Exalted above those whom they set up as (His) peers.’"
Jonah,10,19,"And the entire mankind was one Umma ([Community] in the beginning). Then they (differed amongst themselves and) disintegrated. And if it had not been decreed by your Lord (that the torment would not be hastened), the matters would have been settled between them in which they disagreed."
Jonah,10,20,And (now) they say (because of the same respite): ‘Why has some (decisive) sign not been sent down to this (Messenger [blessings and peace be upon him]) from his Lord?’ Say: ‘The unseen is for Allah alone. So wait. I too am with you amongst those who wait.’
Jonah,10,21,"And when We make the people relish (Our) mercy after they are afflicted with distress, their plotting immediately begins against Our signs (consigning Our favour to oblivion). Say: ‘Allah is Swift to punish intrigues.’ Surely, the angels We have sent keep writing whatever plots you contrive."
Jonah,10,22,"He is the One Who (enables) you to travel through land and sea, until when you board the vessels, and they (the vessels), carrying the passengers, sail with the favourable wind, they rejoice over it. But (all of a sudden) a violent wind overtakes them (the vessels), and (the mounting) waves surge (towards) those (aboard) from all sides. And they start thinking that they are (now) besieged by them (the waves. At that time) they call out to Allah (with the mind) that they sincerely devote their Din (Religion) to Him alone (and submit: ‘O Allah,) if You deliver us from this (monstrous torment), we shall certainly become amongst (Your) grateful servants.’"
Jonah,10,23,"But when Allah delivers them, they take no time to act unjustly rebellious in the land (as before). O people (rebelling against Allah! The havoc wreaked by) your rebellion and revolt is directed only towards your own souls. (You may gain) some benefit of the worldly life but ultimately you have to return to Us. Then We will make you well-aware (of your works) that you have been doing."
Jonah,10,24,"The example of the worldly life is like water which We sent down from the sky. Then, owing to this, there came forth from the earth a thick growth of vegetation which both men and cattle feed on, until when the earth took its (full) bloom and beauty and became fully embellished, and its inhabitants thought that (now) they had full control over it, then (suddenly) Our command (of torment) seized it by night or by day, and We made it mown down as if it did not even exist the day before. That is how We elucidate Our signs to those who apply reason."
Jonah,10,25,"And Allah calls towards the Home of Peace (Paradise), and guides whom He wills to the straight path."
Jonah,10,26,"For those who do pious works, there is good recompense rather more (added to it). And neither (dust and) darkness nor humiliation and disgrace will cover their faces. It is they who are the people of Paradise, its permanent residents."
Jonah,10,27,"And those who have earned evil, the recompense of evil (for them) will be a matching evil and humiliation and ignominy will spread over them. There will be no one to rescue them from (the torment of) Allah. (It will appear) as if their faces have been covered by dark patches of night. It is they who are the inmates of Hell, its permanent residents."
Jonah,10,28,"And the Day when We gather them all together, We shall say to the polytheists: ‘Remain at your respective places, you and your partners (false gods).’ Then We shall disunite them and their (sculptured) partners will say (to them): ‘It was not we that you used to worship."
Jonah,10,29,"So, sufficient is Allah as witness between us and you, for we were (certainly) unaware of your worship.’"
Jonah,10,30,"At that (horrifying) stage, everyone will assess (the reality of the works) which he sent forward, and they will be returned to Allah, Who is their Real Master, and that fabrication of lies they used to practise will vanish from them."
Jonah,10,31,"Say (to them): ‘Who provides you with sustenance from the heaven and the earth (i.e., from above and beneath)? Or Who is the master of your ears and eyes (i.e., hearing and sight)? And Who brings forth the living from the dead (i.e., animate from inanimate) and Who brings forth the dead from the living (i.e., inanimate from animate)? And Who manages (all the cosmic systems)?’ They will promptly say: ‘Allah.’ Then say: ‘So do you not fear (Him)?’"
Jonah,10,32,"So (the Lord of Glory and Might) Allah alone is your true Lord. So what else can there be apart from (this) truth except going astray? Then, distracted, where are you being turned away?"
Jonah,10,33,That is how the judgment of your Lord is proved true against the defiant that they will not believe.
Jonah,10,34,"Inquire (of them): ‘Is there any of your (so-called) partner-gods that originates creation, then restores it (after the total annihilation of life)?’ Say: ‘Allah alone initiates creation (bringing life into existence from non-existence), then He is the One Who will repeat it (as well). So where are you wandering disoriented?’"
Jonah,10,35,"Inquire (of them): ‘Is there any of your (so-called) partner-gods that may lead to the truth?’ Say: ‘Allah alone guides to the truth (Din [Religion]). Then who has greater right to be obeyed—He Who guides to the truth, or he who himself does not find the way unless he is shown the way? (i.e., it should be carried from one place to the other as the disbelievers used to carry their idols as and when required.) So what has gone wrong with you? How do you decide?’"
Jonah,10,36,"Most of them follow nothing but conjecture. Surely, conjecture cannot in the least substitute for the truth. Assuredly, Allah knows best what they do."
Jonah,10,37,"This Qur’an is not such as could be devised without (the Revelation of) Allah. Rather, (it) validates those (Books) which have been (revealed) before it, and is an exposition of whatever (Allah) has written (on the Tablet or in the commandments of Shariah). There is not even an iota of doubt in its (veracity). It is from the Lord of all the worlds."
Jonah,10,38,"Do they say: ‘The Messenger has fabricated it himself’? Say: ‘Then bring forth any (one) Sura (chapter) like it, and call on (for your help) all you can besides Allah if you are truthful.’"
Jonah,10,39,"The truth is that they are denying that (Word of Allah) whose knowledge they failed to encompass, and its truth had (also) not yet manifested before them vividly. Those who have passed before them also denied (the truth) the same way. So see how the wrongdoers met their fate!"
Jonah,10,40,Amongst them there is someone who will believe in it and some other who will not believe in it. And your Lord knows them full well who rouse mischief.
Jonah,10,41,"And if they belie you, then say: ‘For me is my work and for you is your work. You are not accountable for what I do, and I am not accountable for what you do.’"
Jonah,10,42,"And there are some amongst them who (apparently) lend you their ears, but will you make the deaf hear even though they do not have a little capability to understand?"
Jonah,10,43,There are some amongst them who (apparently) look towards you. Will you make the blind see the path even though they have no sight?
Jonah,10,44,"Surely, Allah does not do injustice to the people in the least, but they (themselves) do injustice to their own souls."
Jonah,10,45,"And the Day when He gathers them, (they will feel) as if they had not stayed in the world but for an hour of the day. They will recognize each other. Losers indeed are those who denied the meeting with Allah, and they were not the rightly guided."
Jonah,10,46,"And whether We show you (in the world) some portion of that (torment) which We promise them (and We execute it during your blessed lifetime), or We make you depart this life (before that), they (in any case) are to return to Us. Then Allah (Himself) is witness to what they are doing."
Jonah,10,47,"And there has been coming one Messenger for every Umma (Community). So, when their Messenger came (with clear signs, but they did not believe,) then judgment was made amongst them with justice (and exactly the same will happen on the Last Day). They will not be wronged."
Jonah,10,48,"And they say (sarcastically): ‘When will this promise (of torment) be (fulfilled? Tell us, O Muslims,) if you are truthful.’"
Jonah,10,49,"Say: ‘I am no master of any loss or profit for my own self except what Allah may will. A term is (appointed) for every Umma (Community). When their (appointed) term comes, they can neither stay behind nor advance by a single moment.’"
Jonah,10,50,"Say: ‘(O disbelievers,) just ponder: if His (torment) comes upon you (all of a sudden) by night or by day, (then what will you do)? What is it that the evildoers want in haste?"
Jonah,10,51,Will you believe in it when this (torment) will have befallen? (Then it will be said to you: ‘You believe) now! (Now it is of no avail) whilst you (sarcastically) desired the same (torment) in haste.’
Jonah,10,52,Then it will be said to (these) wrongdoers: ‘Taste the everlasting punishment. You will not be recompensed (anything more) but for the same (deeds) that you used to earn.’
Jonah,10,53,"And they ask you: ‘Is that matter of (everlasting torment certainly) true?’ Say: ‘Yes, by my Lord, it is certainly an absolute truth, and you cannot frustrate (Allah’s plan by your denial).’"
Jonah,10,54,"If every evildoer possessed (all) that (which) is in the earth, he would certainly offer it as ransom (to get rid of) the torment. (But even then he will not be able to escape from the torment.) And when (such people) see the torment, they will conceal their remorse. And judgment will be made amongst them with justice and they will not be wronged."
Jonah,10,55,"Know! Whatever is in the heavens and the earth (all) belongs to Allah alone. Beware! Indeed, the promise of Allah is true but most of them do not know."
Jonah,10,56,"He is the One Who gives life and causes death, and you will be returned to Him alone."
Jonah,10,57,"O mankind! Surely, there has come to you an admonition from your Lord, and a cure for all those (diseases) which are (hidden) in the breasts. And it is guidance and mercy (too) for those who are blessed with faith."
Jonah,10,58,Say: ‘(All this) is due to the bounty and mercy of Allah (bestowed upon you through raising Muhammad [blessings and peace be upon him] as the exalted Messenger). So the Muslims should rejoice over it. This is far better than (all that affluence and wealth) that they amass.’
Jonah,10,59,"Say: ‘Give your view: Allah sent down for you (pure and clean) provision, but you declared some of those (things) unlawful and (others) lawful.’ Say: ‘Did Allah accord you (its) permission? Or are you fabricating a lie against Allah?’"
Jonah,10,60,"And what do those who fabricate lies against Allah think about the Day of Resurrection? Truly, Allah is Most Gracious to the people, but most of them are not thankful."
Jonah,10,61,"And, (O Glorious Beloved,) in whatever state you may be and whatever portion you may recite from the Qur’an, and, (O Umma [Community] of Muhammad, [blessings and peace be upon him]) whatever work you do, We witness and watch over you (at the time) when you are engaged in it. And not even the smallest particle in the earth or in the heaven is hidden from (the knowledge of) your Lord. Nor anything smaller or bigger than that (i.e., smallest particle) is there but is (recorded) in the clear Book (the Protected Tablet [al-Lawh al-Mahfuz])."
Jonah,10,62,"Beware! Verily, the friends of Allah will not have any fear, nor will they grieve."
Jonah,10,63,"(They) are the people who believe and (always) remain Godfearing, committed to piety."
Jonah,10,64,"There is for them the good news (of honour and recognition) in the life of the world, and (also of forgiveness and intercession) in the Hereafter. (Or there are blessed spiritual visions in this world in the form of pious dreams, and in the Hereafter in the shape of effulgent disclosures of Allah’s absolute beauty and sight.) The commands of Allah never change. That is the colossal achievement."
Jonah,10,65,"(O Glorious Messenger!) Let not their (hostile and malicious) conversation grieve you. Surely, all grandeur and authority belong to Allah alone (Who bestows upon whom He wills anything He may please). He is All-Hearing, All-Knowing."
Jonah,10,66,"Know! To Allah belongs whoever is in the heavens and whoever is in the earth. And those who worship (idols) besides Allah do not (in fact) follow (even) their (own sculptured) partner-gods. They follow but only (their own) assumption and conjecture, and they merely indulge in wrong guesswork."
Jonah,10,67,"He is the One Who has made the night for you so that you may rest and relax therein, and made the day bright (so that therein you may do your work). Surely, there are signs in this for those who listen (attentively)."
Jonah,10,68,"They say: ‘Allah has adopted a son (for Himself,’ whereas) He is Holy. He is Self-Sufficient. Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth, all belongs to Him alone. You have no evidence with you of this (false allegation). Do you attribute that (thing) to Allah which you (yourselves) do not know?"
Jonah,10,69,"Say: ‘Surely, those who fabricate lies against Allah shall not prosper.’"
Jonah,10,70,There is (but a few days’) enjoyment in this world. Then they are to return to Us. We shall then afflict them with a severe torment as recompense for their disbelief.
Jonah,10,71,"And relate to them the account of Nuh (Noah) when he said to his people: ‘O my people (the children of Qabil [Cain]), if my stay and my admonition to you by Allah’s Revelations annoy you, then (bear in mind that) I have put my trust in Allah alone (and I am not afraid of you). Therefore, mature your plot (against me) jointly, and also (make) your (sculptured) partner-gods (join in and think hard so that no aspect of) your plot remains obscure to you; then do (whatever you like) against me and do not give me any respite."
Jonah,10,72,"So if you have turned away (from my admonition), then I have not asked for any reward from you. My reward is only with (the bountiful obligation of) Allah, and I have been enjoined to observe perfect obedience and total submission (to His command).’"
Jonah,10,73,"Then his people belied him, so We delivered him and those who were with him in the Ark (from the torment of Deluge), and We made them successors (in the land), and drowned those who denied Our Revelations. So, see how those who were warned met their fate!"
Jonah,10,74,"Then (how many a) Messenger We sent after him towards their respective peoples! They brought them clear signs, but those people (too) did not prove such as would believe in that (matter) which they had already denied. That is how We seal the hearts of those who defy."
Jonah,10,75,"Then, after them, We sent Musa and Harun (Moses and Aaron) with Our signs to Pharaoh and his chiefs. But they displayed arrogance and they were people given to crimes."
Jonah,10,76,"So when the truth came to them from Us, they said: ‘Certainly, this is clear sorcery.’"
Jonah,10,77,Musa (Moses) said: ‘Do you utter (such remarks) about the truth when it has come to you? (Apply your reason and use vision and see) if it is sorcery. And the sorcerers will never be able to prosper.’
Jonah,10,78,"They said: ‘(O Musa [Moses],) have you come to us to turn us away from that (way of life) which we found our fathers (following), and that the upper hand of you both should remain (intact) in the land (of Egypt)? We are not the ones who will ever believe in you both.’"
Jonah,10,79,And Pharaoh said: ‘Bring me every expert sorcerer.’
Jonah,10,80,"So, when the magicians arrived, Musa (Moses) said to them: ‘Throw (all those things on the ground) which you want to throw.’"
Jonah,10,81,"When they threw (their strings and sticks), Musa (Moses) said: ‘Whatever you have brought (here) is magic. Allah will surely prove it false right now. Certainly, Allah does not set right the work of the mischief-mongers."
Jonah,10,82,"And Allah establishes the truth by His Words, even though the evildoers continue to dislike it.’"
Jonah,10,83,"With the exception of a few youth from his people, (none) believed in Musa (Moses), owing to the fear of Pharaoh and their (tribal) chiefs and (nobles), lest they should afflict them with (some) misery. And Pharaoh was indeed a tyrant in the land (of Egypt) and a transgressor. And certainly, he was amongst those who exceed limits (in oppression)."
Jonah,10,84,"And Musa (Moses) said: ‘O my people, if you have believed in Allah, then put your trust in Him alone if you are (truly) believers.’"
Jonah,10,85,"They submitted: ‘We have put trust in Allah alone. O our Lord, make us not victims of the oppressors’ injustice."
Jonah,10,86,And deliver us with Your mercy from (the dominance of) the disbelieving people.’
Jonah,10,87,"And We sent Revelation to Musa (Moses) and his brother: ‘Prepare some houses for your people in (the land of) Egypt, and build these (houses) facing the Qibla (direction for offering Prayer), and (then) establish Prayer and give the believers glad tidings (of victory and help).’"
Jonah,10,88,"And Musa (Moses) said: ‘O our Lord, surely You have provided Pharaoh and his chiefs with the means of embellishment and (abundance of) riches in the life of the world. O our Lord, (have You given them all this) in order that they turn (the people) away from Your Path (sometimes by tempting and sometimes by terrifying them)? O our Lord, destroy their riches and make their hearts (so) callous that even then they may not believe until they see the grievous torment.’"
Jonah,10,89,"(Allah) said: ‘The prayer of you both has indeed been granted. So remain steadfast, both of you, and follow not the path of those who do not possess knowledge.’"
Jonah,10,90,"And We took the Children of Israel across the sea. Pharaoh and his army chased them with rebellion, tyranny and oppression until when he (Pharaoh) was seized by drowning, he said: ‘I believe that there is no god to be worshipped apart from (the God) that the Children of Israel have put faith in and I am (now) of the Muslims.’"
Jonah,10,91,"(Allah said:) ‘Now (you believe) whilst you have been (persistently) disobeying and defying before, and you were of those who spread disruption."
Jonah,10,92,"(O Pharaoh!) We shall today preserve your (lifeless) body so that you may become a sign (of warning) for those who come after you. Indeed, most of the people are neglectful (in understanding) Our signs.’"
Jonah,10,93,"And We indeed provided the Children of Israel with a worthy place to dwell in and with pure and clean sustenance. They did not differ in anything, until knowledge and insight reached them. Your Lord will surely judge amongst them on the Day of Resurrection in the matters wherein they used to differ."
Jonah,10,94,"(O listener!) If you have even a little doubt about this (Book), which We have revealed to you (through Our Messenger [blessings and peace be upon him]), then inquire (about its authenticity) of those who have been reading the Book (of Allah) before you. The truth has no doubt come to you from your Lord, so be not at all of those who doubt."
Jonah,10,95,And never be of those who deny the Revelations of Allah lest you should become of the losers.
Jonah,10,96,"(O Glorious Beloved!) Indeed, those against whom the judgment of your Lord has proved true will not believe,"
Jonah,10,97,Even though all signs should come to them so much so that they see the painful torment (as well).
Jonah,10,98,"Then why has there not been any town, except (the town of) the people of Yunus (Jonah), that believed and its belief brought it profit? When (the people of Yunus [Jonah]) believed (just seeing the sign of torment before it was sent down), We removed from them the punishment of humiliation (even) in the life of the world and We let them avail the profit for a time."
Jonah,10,99,"And had Allah so willed, certainly all inhabitants on the earth would have believed. (When your Lord has not made them believe by force,) will you coerce the people until they become believers?"
Jonah,10,100,And no soul has the capability to believe (on its own) without Allah’s leave. He (Allah) places the impurity of disbelief on those who do not put their reason to work (to grasp the truth).
Jonah,10,101,Say: ‘(Just) observe what signs of Allah’s might are there in (the boundless cosmos of) the heavens and the earth.’ (These) signs and (the Messengers) who warn the people (of Allah’s torment) cannot benefit those who have no intention to believe.
Jonah,10,102,Are they waiting for (the evil days) similar to those of the people who have passed away before them? Say: ‘Wait (then); I am (also) with you amongst those who wait.’
Jonah,10,103,We then save Our Messengers and also those who believe in the same manner. This (provision) is a bountiful obligation upon Us to save the believers.
Jonah,10,104,"Say: ‘O people, if you are in any doubt about (the authenticity of) my Din (Religion), then (listen) that I cannot worship those (idols) whom you worship besides Allah. But I worship that Allah Who causes you to die. And I have been commanded that I must (always) be from amongst the believers;"
Jonah,10,105,"And that, guarding against every falsehood, (with focused attention,) keep your direction towards the Din (Religion) and never be of those who associate partners with Allah.’"
Jonah,10,106,"(This command is being communicated to the Umma [Community] through the Messenger:) ‘Nor worship those (idols) besides Allah, which can neither profit nor harm you. Then if you do it, you will surely be amongst the wrongdoers the same moment.’"
Jonah,10,107,"And if Allah afflicts you with some distress, then there is none who can remove it but He. And if He intends any good for you, then there is none who can repel His bounty. He bestows His bounty upon whomsoever of His servants He pleases. And He is Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful."
Jonah,10,108,"Say: ‘O people, surely the truth has come to you from your Lord. So whoever adopts the path of guidance adopts it for his own good, and he who is misguided goes astray for his own destruction. And I am not a custodian over you (that I should bring you to the path of guidance coercively).’"
Jonah,10,109,"(O Messenger!) Follow the same that is revealed to you, and be steadfast until Allah gives His Judgment, and He is the Best of the judges."
Hûd,11,1,"Alif, Lam, Ra. (Only Allah and the Messenger [blessings and peace be upon him] know the real meaning. This) is (that) Book whose Verses are firmly founded; then they have been explained in detail by (the Lord) Who is All-Wise, All-Aware;"
Hûd,11,2,"That do not worship anyone but Allah. Verily, I am a Warner from Him (Allah) to you and a Bearer of glad tidings;"
Hûd,11,3,"And that you should seek forgiveness from your Lord, then repent before Him (with true hearts). He will keep you glad and gratified with an excellent provision till an appointed term, and will reward for merit everyone enjoying merit (i.e., He will bestow reward and ranks corresponding to one’s amount of righteous deeds and dedicated services). And if you turn away, then I fear for you the torment of a Mighty Day."
Hûd,11,4,You are to return to Allah and He has mighty control over everything.
Hûd,11,5,"Bear in mind! These (disbelievers) fold up their breasts so that they may hide (the state of their hearts) from Him (Allah). Beware! When they cover (their bodies) with their clothes, (even then) He knows all those matters which they hide and which they lay open. Surely, He knows best (the secrets of) the hearts."
Hûd,11,6,And there is no moving creature (living being) on the earth but (that) its sustenance is (a bountiful obligation) upon Allah. And He knows its resting-place and (also) the place where it is to be entrusted. Everything is (recorded) in the enlightening Book (the Protected Tablet [al-Lawh al-Mahfuz]).
Hûd,11,7,"And He (Allah) is the One Who created the heavens and the earth (the higher and the lower strata of the universe) in six days (i.e., six phases or aeons of creation and evolution). And (before the creation of the earth) His Throne of Authority operated on water, (and from that He brought forth all manifestations of life and created you,) so that He put you to trial to evaluate which of you would be best in action. And if you say: ‘You will be raised after death,’ the disbelievers will certainly say: ‘This is nothing (else) but an obvious magic.’"
Hûd,11,8,"And if We defer their torment for a few fixed days, they will definitely say: ‘What has held it back?’ Beware! The day when that (torment) comes upon them, (then) that will not be averted from them, and that (chastisement) which they used to make fun of will beset them."
Hûd,11,9,"And if We make man taste mercy from Us, then withdraw it from him (for some reason), he becomes highly disappointed (and) ungrateful."
Hûd,11,10,"And if We make him taste (some) favour after the suffering that afflicted him, then he is sure to say: ‘Gone are all my troubles.’ Surely, he (becomes) most exultant and boastful,"
Hûd,11,11,Except for those who remain steadfast and continue doing pious deeds. For them is forgiveness and great reward.
Hûd,11,12,"How may it be that you omit a portion of what has been revealed to you, and that your (sanctified) breast feels straitened (by the idea that) the disbelievers say: ‘Why has any treasure not been sent down to him (the Messenger [blessings and peace be upon him]), or why has any angel not come with him’? (O Glorious Messenger! That is impossible.) You are but a Warner. (You are neither to tempt someone nor persecute.) And Allah is a Guardian over everything."
Hûd,11,13,"Do the disbelievers say: ‘The Messenger has fabricated this (Qur’an) himself’? Say: ‘Bring then ten forged Chapters like this, and call (to your help) whom you can except Allah if you are truthful.’"
Hûd,11,14,"(O Muslims!) So, if they do not accept your challenge, then firmly believe that the Qur’an has been revealed with Allah’s knowledge, and that there is no other God but He. So, will you (now) stick to Islam (firm-footed)?"
Hûd,11,15,"Those who lust after the worldly life (only) with its beauty (and embellishment), We pay them back in full for their works here in this world, and their (worldly recompense) is not diminished in the least."
Hûd,11,16,"They are the people for whom there is no (share) in the Hereafter except the Fire (of Hell). And (as for reward in the Hereafter) all (the works) they did in the world have come to nothing, and (all that) they used to do is null and void (because their account is cleared by paying them in full measure in the life of the world, and nothing remains in their balance for the Hereafter)."
Hûd,11,17,"He who holds fast to a clear proof from his Lord, and a testimony (the Qur’an) too has come from his Lord for his strength and support, and prior to that the Book of Musa ([Moses], the Torah), a guide and a mercy (too had come)—so, it is they who believe in it (the Qur’an). Can (such a person be equal to) the one who denies (the Qur’an) from amongst (the disbelieving) sects, whilst his abode is the Fire of Hell? So, (O listener,) be not in any doubt about it. Surely, this (Qur’an) is the truth from your Lord, but most people do not believe."
Hûd,11,18,And who can be a greater wrongdoer than the one who fabricates a lie against Allah? Such people will be brought before their Lord and the witnesses will say: ‘These are the ones who foisted a lie upon their Lord.’ Know that Allah’s curse is upon the wrongdoers—
Hûd,11,19,Those who hinder (others) from the path of Allah and look for crookedness in it. And it is they who deny the Hereafter.
Hûd,11,20,"They have no capability at all to frustrate (Allah) on earth, nor are there any helpers for them apart from Allah. The torment will be doubled for them (because) they had neither courage to hear (the truth) nor vision to see (it)."
Hûd,11,21,"It is they who ruined their souls, and the lies they used to invent are (all) gone from them."
Hûd,11,22,This is absolutely true that it is certainly they who will be the greatest losers in the Hereafter.
Hûd,11,23,"Verily, those who believe and persist in pious works and humble themselves before their Lord, it is they who are the people of Paradise. They will live there forever."
Hûd,11,24,The example of the two parties (the disbelievers and the believers) is like the blind and the deaf (versus) the seeing and the hearing. Are both cases equal? Will you not take advice (even) then?
Hûd,11,25,"And surely, We sent Nuh (Noah) to his people. (He said to them:) ‘I am (raised and appointed as) a plain Warner to you,"
Hûd,11,26,"That you worship none but Allah. Indeed, I fear the torment of a grievous day (coming) upon you.’"
Hûd,11,27,"So the disbelieving chiefs and nobles of his people said: ‘You appear to us but a human like ourselves, and we have not seen any (honourable person) following you except the most inferior and lowest of (our society) having superficial opinion (who have become your followers without using discretion). Nor do we find in you any merit and superiority over us (i.e., power and authority, wealth and riches, or the worthy people joining your party, or for that matter, any such prominent feature). Instead, we consider you to be liars.’"
Hûd,11,28,"Nuh (Noah) said: ‘O my people, what is your view: if I stick to a clear proof from my Lord and He has also granted me His (exceptional) mercy from Himself, but that has been veiled from you (like the blind), can we force it upon you coercively whilst you despise it?"
Hûd,11,29,"And, O my people, I do not (also) demand from you any wealth for (promoting and preaching this message). My reward is only (a bountiful obligation) upon Allah. Nor shall I drive away (for your sake) these (poor and backward) people who have accepted faith. (Do not consider them inferior; it is they who are in fact superior and respectable.) Surely, they are those who will be blessed with meeting with their Lord, and truly I find you an ignorant (and insensible) people."
Hûd,11,30,"And, O my people, if I drive them away, then who will come to my help (to rescue me) from (the wrath of) Allah? Do you not reflect?"
Hûd,11,31,"And I do not say (this) to you: I have treasures of Allah (i.e., I am a wealthy person); nor do I know of the unseen on my own (without Allah’s Revelation). Nor do I say: I am an angel (not a man. My message is not based on charismatic claims). Nor do I say pertaining to those who are inferior in your eyes: Allah will not award them any good at all (that is Allah’s command and everyone’s share). Allah knows best what is in their hearts. (If I were to say that,) surely I shall be amongst the wrongdoers the same moment.’"
Hûd,11,32,"They said: ‘O Nuh (Noah), indeed you have disputed with us and disputed much. So now bring upon us that (torment) which you promise us if you are (really) truthful.’"
Hûd,11,33,Nuh (Noah) said: ‘Allah alone will bring upon you that (torment) if He so wills and you cannot hinder (Him).
Hûd,11,34,"And even if I resolve to counsel you, my counsel (too) will not benefit you if Allah wills to lead you astray. He is your Lord and you will be returned to Him alone.’"
Hûd,11,35,"(O Glorious Messenger!) Do they say: ‘The Messenger has fabricated this (Qur’an) himself’? Say: ‘If I have fabricated it, then I shall have to bear (the resulting torment of) my sin. And I am free of the sin that you are perpetrating.’"
Hûd,11,36,And it was revealed to Nuh (Noah): ‘None of your people will (now) believe (any more) except those who have (so far) believed. So you should not grieve over their (belying and mocking) activities.
Hûd,11,37,"And build an Ark before Our Eyes in compliance with Our instructions, and do not converse with Me (about anything) pertaining to the wrongdoers. They will surely be drowned.’"
Hûd,11,38,"And Nuh (Noah) set himself to building the Ark. And whenever the chiefs of his people passed by him, they would scoff at him. Nuh (Noah) would say (in reply): ‘If you are mocking us (today), we shall also mock you (tomorrow) as you are mocking us."
Hûd,11,39,So you will soon learn upon whom the torment comes (in the world) that will humiliate him and (then whom) the eternal torment befalls (in the Hereafter too).’
Hûd,11,40,"Until when Our command (of torment) came and the oven started gushing (like fountains, then) We said: ‘(O Nuh [Noah],) place aboard the Ark a pair of animals (male and female) of every species, and (take in) your family except those against whom the command (of destruction) has already gone forth, and whoever has believed (also take him with you).’ And, except a few, none had believed with him."
Hûd,11,41,"Nuh (Noah) said: ‘Get into the Ark; in the Name of Allah will it sail and anchor. Surely, my Lord is Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful.’"
Hûd,11,42,"And the Ark kept sailing, carrying them through (violent) waves towering like mountains. Then Nuh (Noah) called out to his son, who had separated from him (and was standing with the disbelievers): ‘O my son, get aboard with us and do not stay with the disbelievers.’"
Hûd,11,43,"He said: ‘(Instead of embarking on the Ark) I shall just now take shelter on some mountain. That will save me from the Deluge.’ Nuh (Noah) said: ‘None can save today from Allah’s punishment except someone to whom He (Allah) shows His mercy.’ In the meanwhile, a (violent) wave came between both (father and son). So he was one of the drowned."
Hûd,11,44,"(And when all were drowned and annihilated except Nuh’s [Noah’s] Ark) it was commanded: ‘O earth, swallow up your water and, O sky, cease pouring.’ And the water was dried and the command was executed and the Ark came to rest on Mount al-Judi and it was said: ‘Far away are the unjust (from mercy)!’"
Hûd,11,45,"And Nuh (Noah) called out to his Lord and submitted: ‘O my Lord, indeed my son (too) was a part of my family, and certainly Your promise is true, and You are the Greatest of all rulers.’"
Hûd,11,46,"(Allah) said: ‘O Nuh (Noah), indeed he is not included in your family because his actions were not righteous. So do not ask Me a question (about matters) of which you have no knowledge. I admonish you lest you should become amongst the unwise.’"
Hûd,11,47,"Nuh (Noah) submitted: ‘O my Lord, I seek refuge with You from asking You that of which I have no knowledge. And if You forgive me not and bestow (not) mercy on me, (then) I shall be of the losers.’"
Hûd,11,48,"He was commanded: ‘O Nuh (Noah), get down (from the Ark) with peace and blessings from Us on you and on the (kingdoms, classes and) species that are with you. And there will (also) be (classes and) species (in the future again) whom We shall provide with (the worldly favours); then a painful torment will come upon them from Us.’"
Hûd,11,49,"This (narration) is of the accounts of the unseen that We reveal to you. Neither you nor your people knew them before this. So observe patience. Surely, it is the Godfearing with whom it ends well."
Hûd,11,50,"And to the people of ‘Ad (We sent) their (kinship) brother Hud. He said: ‘O my people, worship Allah. You have no God other than Him. You merely invent a lie against Allah (of having a partner)."
Hûd,11,51,O my people! I do not demand of you any recompense for this (promotion and preaching of the message). My reward is (a bountiful obligation) upon Him Who has created me. Do you not apply your mind?
Hûd,11,52,"And, O people, seek forgiveness of your Lord (for your sins), then turn towards Him (with true hearts). He will send upon you copious rain from the sky and will add strength to your strength. So, do not turn away from Him becoming sinners.’"
Hûd,11,53,"They said: ‘O Hud, you have not brought us any clear proof. Neither are we going to forsake our gods at your behest, nor are we to believe in you."
Hûd,11,54,"We can say nothing except that one of our gods has afflicted you with (mental) disorder.’ Hud said: ‘Indeed, I call Allah to witness, and you too bear witness that I have no concern with those whom you associate as partners with Allah."
Hûd,11,55,"Except for Him (Allah), join in to hatch (some) plot against me, all of you (including your false gods), then grant me no respite (as well)."
Hûd,11,56,"Surely, I have put my trust in Allah, Who is my Lord (as well as) your Lord. And there is not a moving (living) creature, but He holds it by its forelock (i.e., is completely in the grip of His mighty control). Surely, my Lord is (found by treading) the straight road (of truth and justice)."
Hûd,11,57,"If even then you turn away, I have literally brought you (all those commandments) with which I have been sent to you. And my Lord will appoint some other people in your place as your successors, and you can do Him no harm at all. Surely, my Lord is the Protector of everything.’"
Hûd,11,58,"And when Our command (of torment) came to pass, (then) We saved Hud and the believers with him because of Our mercy, and We delivered them from severe punishment."
Hûd,11,59,And these are (the people of) ‘Ad who denied the Revelations of their Lord and disobeyed their Messengers and followed the dictates of every oppressive (and arrogant) enemy of the truth.
Hûd,11,60,"A curse was set to chase them in this world, and (will chase them) on the Day of Resurrection (as well). Bear in mind that (the people of) ‘Ad denied their Lord. Beware! Far away (from mercy) are the ‘Ad, the people of Hud!"
Hûd,11,61,"And (We sent) to (the people of) Thamud their (kinship) brother Salih. He said: ‘O my people, worship Allah. You have no God apart from Him. He is the One Who raised you up from the earth and settled you therein. So, beg His forgiveness and then turn to Him in repentance. Surely, my Lord is Near, Granting prayers.’"
Hûd,11,62,"They said: ‘O Salih, only you have been the centre of hopes amongst our people before this. Are you forbidding us to worship those (idols) which our forefathers used to worship? We are really caught in a disquieting doubt about (the Oneness of Allah) towards which you are calling us.’"
Hûd,11,63,"Salih said: ‘O my people, just think, if I cling to a clear proof from my Lord, and I have been blessed with a (special) mercy from Him, (then after that) if I disobey Him (by holding back His commandments from you), then who can help me escape from (the torment of) Allah? So, you can add to me nothing except inflicting loss."
Hûd,11,64,"And, O my people, this is a (peculiarly created) she-camel of Allah, (which is) a sign for you. So leave her free to graze in Allah’s earth, and do her no harm lest an imminent torment should seize you.’"
Hûd,11,65,Then they (hamstrung and) slaughtered her. Salih said: ‘(Now) luxuriate in your abodes (only) for three days. This is a promise which will (never) become untrue.’
Hûd,11,66,"Then, when Our command (of torment) came to pass, We saved Salih and the believers with him through Our mercy and (also delivered them) from the humiliation of that day. Surely, your Lord alone is Powerful, Sovereign."
Hûd,11,67,"And a dreadful blast overtook the wrongdoers. So morning found them (dead), lying prone in their homes,"
Hûd,11,68,As if they had never dwelled there. Remember! (The people of) Thamud denied their Lord. Beware! Far away (from mercy) are (the people of) Thamud!
Hûd,11,69,"And indeed, Our deputed angels came to Ibrahim (Abraham), bearing glad tidings. They greeted him, saying: ‘Peace (be on you),’ and Ibrahim (Abraham) reciprocated: ‘Peace (be on you).’ Then he did not take any time and brought (them) a roasted calf (out of hospitality)."
Hûd,11,70,"Then, when (Ibrahim [Abraham]) saw that their hands did not stretch towards that (dish), he took them as strangers and felt a little fear of them in (his) heart. They said: ‘Do not be afraid. We have been sent to the people of Lut (Lot).’"
Hûd,11,71,And his wife (Sara) who was standing (beside him) laughed. So We conveyed to his (wife) the glad tidings of the birth of Ishaq (Isaac) and beyond Ishaq of Ya‘qub (Jacob).
Hûd,11,72,She said: ‘Amazing! Shall I bear a child whilst I have grown old and my husband (too) is an old man? This is extremely astonishing indeed!’
Hûd,11,73,"The angels said: ‘Are you wondering at Allah’s command? O people of the house, (showered) upon you are mercy and blessings of Allah. Indeed, He (is) Praiseworthy, Glorious.’"
Hûd,11,74,"So when fear disappeared from Ibrahim (Abraham) and the glad tidings reached him, he disputed (with) Our (angels) about the people of Lut (Lot)."
Hûd,11,75,"Assuredly, Ibrahim (Abraham) was most forbearing, sobbing and submissive and turning to Us under all circumstances."
Hûd,11,76,"(The angels said:) ‘O Ibrahim (Abraham), leave off this (matter). Surely, the command of (torment from) your Lord has now come to pass, and the torment is about to seize them which cannot be averted.’"
Hûd,11,77,"And when Our deputed angels visited Lut (Lot), he felt worried on their arrival and on account of them his strength sank and he said: ‘This is a day of great distress.’ (The angels were extremely handsome, and Lut [Lot] was aware of the evil habit of his people, so he was perturbed for fear of possible mischief.)"
Hûd,11,78,"(So, that which he feared took place.) The people of Lut ([Lot], hearing about the arrival of the guests,) came to him running. And they were already addicted to evil-doing. Lut (Lot) said: ‘O my (disobedient) people, here are my (people’s) daughters. They are pure and lawful for you (through marriage). So, fear Allah and do not humiliate me in the presence of my guests (because of your indecency). Is there not amongst you even a single man of upright character?’"
Hûd,11,79,They said: ‘You know well that we have nothing to do with your (people’s) daughters. And you certainly know what we desire.’
Hûd,11,80,"Lut (Lot) said: ‘Would that I had the power to resist you, or I could seek shelter (today) in some unassailable fort!’"
Hûd,11,81,"(Thereupon the angels) said: ‘O Lut (Lot), we are the messengers of your Lord. These people shall never be able to get at you. So leave during a part of the night with your family and let not any of you look (back); but (do not take) your wife (with you). The same (torment) that will come upon them is going to reach her (too). Surely, the time appointed for their (torment) is the morning. And is the morning not near?’"
Hûd,11,82,"Then, when Our command (of chastisement) came to pass, We turned the town upside down, and We rained upon it stones and pebbles of baked clay which incessantly teemed down (layer upon layer),"
Hûd,11,83,Which were marked by your Lord. And this (torment of stones) is not far away from the wrongdoers (even now).
Hûd,11,84,"And We (sent) to (the people of) Madyan their (kinship) brother Shu‘ayb. He said: ‘O my people, worship Allah. You have no God but He. And do not give short measure and weight. Indeed, I see you prosperous, but I fear for you the torment of a day which is about to encompass (you)."
Hûd,11,85,"And, O my people, give full measure and full weight with justice, and do not give people their things less than their due. And do not spread destruction in the land by becoming mischief-mongers."
Hûd,11,86,That which is left over from Allah’s provision (only that) is better for you if you have faith. And I am not a guardian over you.’
Hûd,11,87,"They said: ‘O Shu‘ayb, does your prayer only command you that we forsake those (gods) which our fathers have been worshipping, or that we refrain from doing with our wealth what we like? Surely, you (alone) must be the most tolerant and guided one!’"
Hûd,11,88,"Shu‘ayb said: ‘O my people, tell me if I adhere to the clear proof from my Lord, and He has also granted me pure and fine means of living from His presence (then why should I not preach the truth)? I (also) do not want that, following you, I myself start doing (against the truth) the same that I am forbidding you. All I desire is to reform (you) as far as I can, and my capability comes only from Allah’s (help). So I have put my trust in Him alone and I turn towards Him alone."
Hûd,11,89,"And, O my people, let not your enmity and hostility against me incite you (due to which) there comes upon you the (torment) that befell the people of Nuh (Noah), or the people of Hud, or the people of Salih. And (the days of) the people of Lut (Lot) have not passed far before you."
Hûd,11,90,"And seek forgiveness from your Lord, then turn to Him in repentance (with true hearts). Indeed, my Lord is Ever-Merciful, Most Loving."
Hûd,11,91,"They said: ‘O Shu‘ayb, we do not understand most of your words, and we know you as a weak person in society. And were it not for your family, we would stone you. (This is what we are conceding for, otherwise) you enjoy no respect in our eyes.’"
Hûd,11,92,"Shu‘ayb said: ‘O my people, is my family more venerable to you than Allah? And you have (as if) cast Him (Allah) behind your backs. Surely, my Lord has encompassed (all) your works."
Hûd,11,93,"And, O my people, keep working in your place; I am doing my work. Soon will you come to know whom that torment seizes which will humiliate him, and who it is that is a liar. And wait on, and I (too) wait along with you.’"
Hûd,11,94,"And when Our command (of torment) came, We saved Shu‘ayb and the believers with him through Our mercy, but a dreadful blast seized the wrongdoers. So they reached the morning (as dead) lying prostrate in their homes—"
Hûd,11,95,As if they had never put up there. Listen! (The people of) Madyan are doomed as were doomed (the people of) Thamud.
Hûd,11,96,"And indeed, We sent Musa (Moses too) with Our signs and a clear proof,"
Hûd,11,97,"To Pharaoh and his chiefs. The chiefs of the people obeyed the command of Pharaoh, although Pharaoh’s command was not right."
Hûd,11,98,"On the Day of Resurrection, he will lead his people, and will ultimately bring them down into the Fire of Hell. And how evil that place is to be ushered into!"
Hûd,11,99,"And the curse has been made to chase them in this world, and (this will chase them) on the Day of Resurrection (as well). What an evil gift has been bestowed upon them!"
Hûd,11,100,(O Glorious Messenger!) That is some of the news We are relating to you of (those) towns some of which still exist and (some) were totally annihilated.
Hûd,11,101,"And We did not wrong them, but they (themselves) wronged their souls. So, their false gods whom they worshipped besides Allah proved to them of no help when the command (of the torment) of your Lord came forth. And those (gods) could add only to their destruction and devastation."
Hûd,11,102,"And that is how your Lord grips: He seizes the communities when they (become) tyrannous and corrupt. Surely, His grip is agonizing and fierce."
Hûd,11,103,"Indeed, these (episodes) contain lessons of warning for him who fears the chastisement of the Last Day. This (Day of Rising) is the Day when entire mankind will be gathered together, and it is this Day when all will be made present."
Hûd,11,104,And We are not deferring it but for an appointed term (which has already been fixed).
Hûd,11,105,"When that Day comes, not a soul will be able to speak without His permission. Then some of them will be unfortunate and others fortunate."
Hûd,11,106,So those who will be unfortunate will be (put) into Hell; there they will be given to screaming and wailing.
Hûd,11,107,"They will abide in it till the heavens and the earth (which will then exist) last except as your Lord wills. Surely, your Lord executes what He wills."
Hûd,11,108,And those who will be fortunate will be in Paradise. They will abide in it forever till the heavens and the earth (which will then exist) endure except as your Lord wills. This is a bounty which will never be withdrawn.
Hûd,11,109,"So, (O listener,) do not have any doubt at all about those which they worship. They do not worship (on the basis of any reason or insight), but they worship only as their ancestors have done contiguously before. And certainly, We will pay them their full share (of torment) which will not be diminished in the least."
Hûd,11,110,"And indeed, We gave Musa (Moses) the Book. Then differences arose concerning it. And had there not been a decree from your Lord that had gone forth before, the judgment between them would surely have been passed. And they are certainly caught in a disquieting doubt about it (the Qur’an)."
Hûd,11,111,Your Lord will doubtlessly pay them in full for their works. He is certainly Well Aware of whatever they are doing.
Hûd,11,112,"So remain firm-footed as you have been commanded, and he too who has turned (to Allah) in your companionship (must persevere). And, (O people,) do not revolt. Indeed, He monitors whatever you do."
Hûd,11,113,"And incline not towards those who are engaged in oppression (and exploitation) lest the Fire (of Hell) should touch down at you, and there will be no protector for you apart from Allah; then help (too) will not be extended to you."
Hûd,11,114,"And establish Prayer at the two ends of the day and in some parts of the night. Surely, good actions erase the evil ones. This is an admonition for those who accept admonition."
Hûd,11,115,"And be steadfast. Surely, Allah does not let the reward of the pious go to waste."
Hûd,11,116,"So why were there not amongst the communities, that preceded you, men of superior morality and wisdom, who would stop people from mischief-mongering in the land, except a few of them whom We delivered? And the unjust stuck to (the same path of) luxury and lustfulness they were addicted to. And they were (regular) criminals."
Hûd,11,117,"And your Lord is not such that He would destroy the towns wrongfully, whilst their dwellers are pious."
Hûd,11,118,"And had your Lord so willed, He would have made mankind one Umma (Community. But He has not done so by force. On the contrary, He has given free choice to all to adopt a religion.) And (now) these people will always hold divergent views,"
Hûd,11,119,"Except for him on whom your Lord has bestowed His mercy, and that is what He has created them for. And the Word of your Lord has been fulfilled: ‘Surely, I will fill Hell with all the (disbelieving) jinn and men.’"
Hûd,11,120,"And We are relating to you all the news of the Messengers whereby We strengthen your (most purified) heart. And in this (Chapter), there has come to you the truth and advice and a lesson of warning (and also a reminder) for the believers."
Hûd,11,121,"And say to those who do not believe: ‘Work on in your place, and we are doing (what our station demands)."
Hûd,11,122,And wait on; we (too) are waiting.’
Hûd,11,123,"And (all) the unseen of the heavens and the earth belongs to Allah alone, and He is the One towards Whom every act is returned. So keep worshipping Him and keep trust in Him alone. And your Lord is not unmindful of the deeds that all of you do."
Joseph,12,1,"Alif, Lam, Ra. (Only Allah and the Messenger [blessings and peace be upon him] know the real meaning.) These are the Verses of the illumining Book."
Joseph,12,2,"Verily, We have revealed it as a Qur’an in the Arabic language so that you comprehend (it directly)."
Joseph,12,3,"(O Beloved!) We relate to you the best narrative by means of this Qur’an which We have revealed to you, though you were unaware (of this story) before this."
Joseph,12,4,(Recall) when Yusuf (Joseph) said to his father: ‘O my venerable father! I have seen (in a dream) eleven stars and the sun and the moon. I have seen them prostrating themselves before me.’
Joseph,12,5,"He said: ‘O my son, do not relate your dream to your brothers, lest they should maneuver a plot against you. Surely, Satan is an open enemy to man."
Joseph,12,6,"And in the same way, your Lord will choose you (for a divine station) and will teach you how to infer conclusions (i.e., the knowledge of the interpretation of dreams) and will perfect His favour upon you and the House of Ya‘qub (Jacob) as He perfected it upon your fathers (grandfather and great grandfather) Ibrahim (Abraham) and Ishaq (Isaac). Indeed, your Lord is All-Knowing, Most Wise.’"
Joseph,12,7,"Surely, there are (many) signs (in the parable of) Yusuf (Joseph) and his brothers for those who are inquisitive."
Joseph,12,8,"(Recall) when the brothers of Yusuf (Joseph) said: ‘Certainly, Yusuf (Joseph) and his brother are dearer to our father than we are, whereas we are a stronger party (comprising ten members). No doubt, our father is lost in an evident ecstasy (resulting from deep love for them).’"
Joseph,12,9,"(Now the only solution is:) ‘Kill Yusuf (Joseph), or banish him to some distant, unknown place. (Thus) your father’s attention will be focused purely on you, and after that you will become a group of righteous people (by turning towards Allah in repentance).’"
Joseph,12,10,"A negotiator from amongst them said: ‘Do not kill Yusuf (Joseph), rather lower him down at the bottom of a deep, dark well. Some traveller will pick him up and carry him away. (So do this) if you are (at all) up to (something).’"
Joseph,12,11,"They said: ‘O our father, what has happened to you that you do not trust us in the case of Yusuf (Joseph), whilst we are certainly his well-wishers?"
Joseph,12,12,Send him with us tomorrow. He will eat lavishly and play and certainly we are his guards.’
Joseph,12,13,"He said: ‘This idea indeed makes me sad that you take him along, and I am (also) afraid (of this idea) that some wolf may devour him, whilst you are careless of his (safeguard).’"
Joseph,12,14,"They said: ‘If the wolf devours him whilst we, a strong party, too are (present), then we are inept losers.’"
Joseph,12,15,"Then, when they took him along and all agreed to throw him into some deep, dark well, We revealed to him: ‘(O Yusuf [Joseph], do not worry. A time will come when) you will certainly remind them of this affair of theirs, and they will not have the sense (of your exalted station).’"
Joseph,12,16,"And (throwing Yusuf [Joseph] into the well,) they came to their father at night, weeping (deceptively)."
Joseph,12,17,"They said: ‘O our father, we went racing with one another and left Yusuf (Joseph) with our belongings. Then a wolf devoured him, but you will not believe us even though we are truthful.’"
Joseph,12,18,"And they produced Yusuf’s (Joseph’s) shirt, smeared (also) with false blood. (Ya‘qub [Jacob]) said: ‘(This is not the truth.) But your (jealous, ill-commanding) selves have made (a colossal) task easy and pleasant-looking for you (which you eventually did accomplish). So better it is to be steadfast (over this tragedy), and I seek only Allah’s help against whatever you are narrating.’"
Joseph,12,19,"And (there) came a caravan of travellers. They sent their water-drawer. So he lowered his bucket (into the well) and he exclaimed: ‘Good news! Here is a boy!’ And they hid him, regarding him a valuable trade item. And Allah knows well the activities they were busy doing."
Joseph,12,20,"And Yusuf’s (Joseph’s) brothers (who had returned to the site showed him as their deserter servant and) sold him (to the same caravan) for a low price—a few dirhams—because the travellers were (already) disinterested in (buying) him. (And later, the travellers took him to Egypt where they sold him.)"
Joseph,12,21,"And the man in Egypt who purchased him (named Qatfir, the finance minister of the King of Egypt Riyan b. Walid, commonly known as ‘Aziz [of Egypt,]) said to his wife (Zulaykha): ‘Make his stay honourable. He may bring us profit, or we may adopt him as a son.’ Thus We established Yusuf (Joseph), and strengthened his position in the land (of Egypt), so that We might teach him how to infer from the events (i.e., the interpretation of dreams). And Allah is the Master of His work, but most people do not know."
Joseph,12,22,"And when he reached his full manhood, We endowed him with the judgment (of Prophethood) and the knowledge (of the interpretation of dreams). And this is how We bless the pious with reward."
Joseph,12,23,"And the woman (Zulaykha), in whose house he was putting up, sought intensely to seduce him and she bolted the doors (as well) and said: ‘Come! Make haste! (I ask you.)’ Yusuf (Joseph) said: ‘I seek Allah’s refuge. Surely, he (your husband) is my master. He has kept me most honourably. Indeed, the wrongdoers will not prosper.’"
Joseph,12,24,"(Yusuf [Joseph] refused) but she (Zulaykha) had definitely made up her mind for him. And he too (might) have resolved had he not seen the clear sign of his Lord.* It was (made to happen) like that (in order that) We might keep both affliction and indecency away from him. Assuredly, he was of Our chosen (exalted) servants."
Joseph,12,25,"And they both ran (one behind the other) towards the door, and she (Zulaykha) tore his shirt from behind, and both found her husband (‘Aziz of Egypt) at the door. She (immediately) said: ‘What can be the punishment for him who intends to commit indecency with your wife, except that he should be put in prison, or (he) be given painful torment?’"
Joseph,12,26,"Yusuf (Joseph) said: ‘(No indeed! In truth) it was she herself who sought to seduce me for her purpose.’ And (in the meanwhile) one of her household (who was an infant) bore witness: ‘If his shirt is torn from the front, then she has spoken the truth and he is of the liars."
Joseph,12,27,"But if his shirt is torn from behind, then she is a liar and he is of the truthful.’"
Joseph,12,28,"Then, when he (‘Aziz of Egypt) saw his shirt and found it torn from behind, he said: ‘This is the craft of you women. Certainly, your women-craft is highly (dangerous)."
Joseph,12,29,"O Yusuf (Joseph)! Ignore it and, (O Zulaykha,) ask forgiveness for your sin. Surely, it is you who are of the sinful.’"
Joseph,12,30,And some women of (the elite class in) the city began to say: ‘The wife of ‘Aziz seeks to seduce her slave-boy for her purpose. The love for him (the slave) has gone deep into her heart. We surely see her in manifest error.’
Joseph,12,31,"So when she (Zulaykha) heard their deceitful talk, she sent for them and arranged a meeting for them. (She placed fruit before them) and gave each one of them a knife and requested (Yusuf): ‘Walk out before them (so that they may realize the cause of my state of mind).’ So, when they glanced at Yusuf (Joseph and) saw (his dazzling beauty), they began to exalt (the charm of his ecstatic beauty) and (in a dazed state) cut their hands (instead of the fruits served to them). And (having seen him) they exclaimed (spontaneously): ‘God save us! This is not a human being; he must be some exalted angel (i.e., an embodiment of light descending from the transcendent realm of divinity)!’"
Joseph,12,32,"(Zulaykha’s trick worked.) She spoke (at this juncture): ‘It is this (embodiment of light) you have been reproaching me for. It is, no doubt, I who sought to seduce him (under violent urge), but he remained firmly upright and did not yield. And if (even now) he does not do what I bid him, he will surely be put into prison and will certainly be disgraced.’"
Joseph,12,33,"(By now the elite Egyptian women too had agreed to Zulaykha’s viewpoint. Hearing them,) Yusuf (Joseph) submitted: ‘O my Lord! The prison is far dearer to me than what these women are inviting me to. And if You do not turn away their craft from me, I shall incline towards their (words) and shall become of the unwise.’"
Joseph,12,34,"So, his Lord granted him the prayer and removed the women-craft from him. Surely, He is the One Who is All-Hearing, All-Knowing."
Joseph,12,35,"Then even after seeing the signs of (Yusuf’s [Joseph’s] decency and righteousness), they deemed it appropriate to imprison him for a time (so that the gossip of the episode amongst the people might die down)."
Joseph,12,36,"And with him, two young men also entered the prison. One of them said: ‘I have seen myself (in a dream) pressing wine (from grapes).’ And the other said: ‘I have seen myself (in a dream) that I am carrying bread on my head, with birds picking at it. O Yusuf (Joseph)! Tell us its interpretation. Surely, we see you as one of the spiritually excellent.’"
Joseph,12,37,"Yusuf (Joseph) said: ‘The food which is served to you (daily) will not have yet come to you when I shall inform both of you about its interpretation before its coming to you. This (interpretation) is of those branches of knowledge that my Lord has taught me. Verily, I have rejected (from the very beginning) the religion of the people who do not believe in Allah, and they deny the Hereafter as well."
Joseph,12,38,"And I follow the Din (Religion) of my father and forefathers: Ibrahim (Abraham), Ishaq (Isaac) and Ya‘qub (Jacob). And we have no right to associate anything as a partner with Allah. This (belief in the Oneness of Allah) is a (special) bounty of Allah upon us and the people, but most people do not give thanks."
Joseph,12,39,"O my two companions of the prison! (Say:) Are many separate gods better or One Allah, Who dominates and controls all?"
Joseph,12,40,"(In fact) you worship none besides Allah except a few names which you and your forefathers have forged (on your own). Allah has not sent down any authority for them. Judgment rests with Allah alone. He alone has commanded that you worship none but Him. This is the straight path (true Din [Religion]), but most people do not know."
Joseph,12,41,"O my two companions of the prison! (The interpretation of the dream of) one of you (is that he) will serve wine to his master (the king), and as for the other, (who has seen bread on his head,) he will be crucified and then birds will pick at his head. The (final) judgment has been given about which you have asked.’"
Joseph,12,42,"And Yusuf (Joseph) said to the one whom he believed to be released: ‘Mention me to your king (he may thus recall that another innocent one is also lying in imprisonment).’ But Satan made him forget to mention (him) to his king, and consequently, Yusuf (Joseph) remained in prison for several years.’"
Joseph,12,43,"And (one day) the king said: ‘I have beheld (in a dream) seven fat cows whom seven lean cows are devouring, and (I have beheld) seven green ears of corn and (seven) others dry. O courtiers! Explain to me the implication of my dream if you know the interpretation of dreams.’"
Joseph,12,44,"They said: ‘These are confused dreams, and we do not know the interpretation of confused dreams.’"
Joseph,12,45,"And one of the two prisoners, who had been released and (now) after a long time remembered (his promise to Yusuf [Joseph]), said: ‘I shall tell you its interpretation; so send me (to Yusuf [Joseph]).’"
Joseph,12,46,"(Reaching the prison, he said:) ‘O Yusuf (Joseph), the embodiment of truth, explain to us the interpretation (of this dream) that there are seven fat cows whom seven lean ones are devouring and there are seven green ears of corn and seven others which are dry, so that I may return to the people (taking the interpretation) and that they may realize (your value and dignity).’"
Joseph,12,47,"Yusuf (Joseph) said: ‘You will cultivate as usual, consecutively for seven years. So whatever you reap, keep it (in storage), leaving the grains in their ears except a small quantity (to thresh) for your (yearly) consumption."
Joseph,12,48,"Then after this, there will come seven hard years (of drought) which will consume that (store) which you will have laid up for these years except a small quantity (which will fall surplus and) which you will keep in reserve."
Joseph,12,49,"Then, following this, will come a year during which people will be blessed with (plenty of) rain, and (the yield of fruits will be such as) they will press juices (of fruits that year).’"
Joseph,12,50,"And (hearing this interpretation) the king said: ‘Bring Yusuf (Joseph) to me (immediately).’ So when the messenger reached Yusuf (Joseph), he said to him: ‘Go back to your king and ask him: What is the state of those women (now) who cut their hands? Surely, my Lord knows their craft well.’"
Joseph,12,51,"The king (called all the women including Zulaykha and) asked: ‘What happened to you when you (all) attempted to seduce Yusuf (Joseph) to turn him away from righteousness? (Explain what that affair was.) They all (unanimously) uttered: ‘Allah save us! We have not noticed any evil in Yusuf (Joseph).’ The wife of ‘Aziz (of Egypt, Zulaykha, too) spoke: ‘The truth has now become evident. (The fact is that) it was I who sought to seduce him for my purpose, and it is surely he who is truthful.’"
Joseph,12,52,"(Yusuf [Joseph]) said: ‘I have done this) so that he (‘Aziz of Egypt, who has been my master and benefactor,) may know that I have not betrayed his trust in his absence, and surely Allah lets not the plots of those who betray trusts prove successful."
Joseph,12,53,"And I do not (claim) absolution of my self. Certainly, the self commands much evil except the one on whom my Lord bestows mercy. Surely, my Lord is All-Forgiving, Ever-Merciful.’"
Joseph,12,54,"And the king said: ‘Bring him to me so that I may appoint him specifically (as an adviser) to me.’ So, when the king had a (one-to-one) dialogue with him, he (felt highly impressed and) said: ‘(O Yusuf [Joseph],) surely from today onward you are a man of authority and trust with us (i.e., you are inducted into the governance of the state).’"
Joseph,12,55,"Yusuf (Joseph) said: ‘(If you really want me to accomplish a special assignment, then) appoint me as (a minister and trustee of) the treasures in the land (of Egypt). Indeed, I am well versed in resource management and resource protection and an expert (in financial management).’"
Joseph,12,56,"This is how We bestowed upon Yusuf (Joseph) the rule over the land (of Egypt so that) he could live therein wherever he desired. We honour with Our mercy whom We will, and We waste not the reward of the pious."
Joseph,12,57,"And certainly, the reward of the Hereafter is of greater value for those who believe and tread the path of Godwariness."
Joseph,12,58,"(During the days of famine) Yusuf’s (Joseph’s) brothers came (to Egypt to procure grain) and came to him. So Yusuf (Joseph) recognized them, but they could not recognize him."
Joseph,12,59,"And when Yusuf (Joseph) had furnished them with their provisions (supplies and material), he said: ‘Bring me (Benjamin) your brother on the father’s side. Do you not see (how) full I measure and I am the best host (too)?"
Joseph,12,60,"So if you do not bring him to me, then (in the future) there will not be any measure (of grain) with me for you, nor will you be able to approach me.’"
Joseph,12,61,They said: ‘We will solicit his father in connection with sending him and we will certainly do (it).’
Joseph,12,62,"And Yusuf (Joseph) said to his servants: ‘Put their money (which they paid for grain back) into their sacks so that when they return to their family, they may identify it (that the money is back). It is likely that they may come again (for the very same reason).’"
Joseph,12,63,"So when they returned to their father, they said: ‘O our father, (further provision of) grain for us has been banned (except that Benjamin accompanies us). So send our brother (Benjamin) with us (in order that) we may fetch (more) grain, and we shall certainly be his guards.’"
Joseph,12,64,"Ya‘qub (Jacob) said: ‘Shall I trust you with him (as well) the same way as before this I trusted you with his brother (Yusuf—Joseph)? Then Allah alone is the Best Protector, and He alone is the Most Merciful of all the merciful.’"
Joseph,12,65,"And when they opened their packs, (therein) they found their money (which) had been returned to them. They said: ‘O our respectable father, what else do we want? Here is our money (too) that has been returned to us, and we shall (now be obliged to) fetch grain for our family. And we shall take good care of our brother, and shall bring the load of a camel in addition. This grain (that we have already brought) is a small quantity.’"
Joseph,12,66,"Ya‘qub (Jacob) said: ‘I shall not send him with you at all until you give me a firm promise by swearing a solemn oath by Allah that you shall certainly bring him (back) to me unless you (all) are beset (somewhere or slain). Then, when they gave Ya‘qub (Jacob) the firm promise, he said: ‘Allah is the Guardian to watch over what we are saying.’"
Joseph,12,67,"And he said: ‘O my sons, do not enter (the city) all of you by one gate, but enter (dispersed) through different gates. And I cannot save you by any means from Allah’s (decree) because judgment (i.e., destiny) rests with Allah alone. In Him have I put my trust, and all those who trust must trust in Him alone.’"
Joseph,12,68,"And when they entered (Egypt) in compliance with what their father had commanded, that command could not save them from Allah’s (decree), but it was Ya‘qub’s (Jacob’s) heartfelt desire which he fulfilled and (also take not this desire or strategy as meaningless—for you know it not). Surely, Ya‘qub (Jacob) possessed knowledge as We had blessed (him) with (special) knowledge, but most people do not know (these realities)."
Joseph,12,69,"And when they came to Yusuf (Joseph), he offered his brother (Benjamin) a seat close to him (and) said (to him quietly): ‘Verily, I am your brother (Yusuf [Joseph]) so feel not aggrieved at what they have been doing.’"
Joseph,12,70,"So when (Yusuf [Joseph]) had provided them with their material, he placed (the king’s) goblet into his brother’s (Benjamin’s) sack. Later a herald called out: ‘O you men of caravan, (halt;) surely, you (seem to be) thieves.’"
Joseph,12,71,They turned towards them and said: ‘What have you found missing?’
Joseph,12,72,"They (the servants of the king’s court) said: ‘We are missing the royal goblet, and the man who brings it (after searching) will get a camel’s load of grain as reward and I pledge myself for it.’"
Joseph,12,73,"They said: ‘By Allah, indeed you know well we have not come (here to commit some crime) and create mischief in the land, nor are we thieves.’"
Joseph,12,74,They (the servants) said: ‘(Decide for yourselves) what the punishment (of the thief) should be if you turn out to be liars.’
Joseph,12,75,"They said: ‘Its penalty will be that the one from whose sack (the goblet) is found, he himself will be its penalty (i.e., he should be held in retribution). That is how we punish the wrongdoers.’"
Joseph,12,76,So Yusuf (Joseph) began to search their sacks before his brother’s. Then (at last) he took (the goblet) out of his (real) brother’s (Benjamin’s) sack. That is how We revealed to Yusuf (Joseph) the plan. He could not have held his brother (as a captive) under the law of the king (of Egypt) except (as) Allah wills. We exalt in ranks whom We like. And above every possessor of knowledge is (also) One possessing greater knowledge.
Joseph,12,77,"They said: ‘If he has committed theft (then there is nothing to wonder at). Indeed, his brother (Yusuf [Joseph]) has also committed theft before. So Yusuf (Joseph) kept it (hidden) in his heart and did not reveal it to them and said (only to himself): ‘Yours is the worst case and Allah knows well whatever you are saying.’"
Joseph,12,78,"They said: ‘O ‘Aziz (of Egypt), his father is an aged, elderly person. So detain any one of us in his stead. Surely, we have seen that you are of the generous (and benevolent) people.’"
Joseph,12,79,Yusuf (Joseph) said: ‘Allah save us from detaining someone (other) than him with whom we have found our item! Then we shall become of the unjust.’
Joseph,12,80,"So, when they lost hope about Yusuf (Joseph), they counselled (amongst themselves) in isolation. The eldest (brother) amongst them said: ‘Do you not know that your father took a firm covenant from you in the Name of Allah, and before that (you also know) you committed excesses with respect to Yusuf (Joseph)? So I shall not leave this land at all until my father accords me permission, or Allah gives some judgment in my case, and He is the Best of those who judge."
Joseph,12,81,"Go you back to your father and say: O our father, your son has surely committed theft (and consequently he has been held). And we bore witness only to what we knew. And we were no guardians of the unseen."
Joseph,12,82,"And (if you do not believe us, then) you may enquire of (the people of) the town where we have been, and (find out) from the caravan we have travelled with, and we are certainly truthful (in what we are saying).’"
Joseph,12,83,"Ya‘qub (Jacob) said: ‘(It is not so.) In fact, your (ill-commanding) selves have made this affair attractive for you. Now (only) patience is the finest (option). It is likely that Allah brings to me all of them. He is indeed All-Knowing, Most Wise.’"
Joseph,12,84,Ya‘qub (Jacob) then turned his face away from them and said: ‘Alas! (My dear son) Yusuf (Joseph’s unbearable separation)!’ And his eyes had gone white with grief. And he was suppressing his sorrow.
Joseph,12,85,"They said: ‘By Allah, you will continue remembering Yusuf ([Joseph] alone) till you get near death or pass away.’"
Joseph,12,86,"He said: ‘I bewail my worry and grief to Allah alone, and I know from Allah what you do not know."
Joseph,12,87,"O my sons, go and fetch me some news about Yusuf (Joseph) and his brother (from somewhere) and despair not of Allah’s mercy, for indeed only those who reject faith despair of Allah’s mercy.’"
Joseph,12,88,"So when they came back to Yusuf ([Joseph] again), they submitted: ‘O ‘Aziz (of Egypt), a distress has fallen upon us and our family (and we are suffering from a dreadful famine). And we have brought only (this) meager amount. So give us full measure (of grain against it) and (in addition) extend to us (some) charity (as well). Indeed, Allah plenteously rewards those who give away charity.’"
Joseph,12,89,Yusuf (Joseph) said: ‘Do you remember what you did to Yusuf (Joseph) and his brother? Were you (then) ignorant?’
Joseph,12,90,"They said: ‘Are you really Yusuf (Joseph)?’ He said: ‘(Yes,) I am Yusuf (Joseph) and here is my brother. Indeed, Allah has been gracious to us. Surely, the one who fears Allah and remains steadfast, then surely Allah does not waste the reward of the pious.’"
Joseph,12,91,"They exclaimed: ‘By Allah, Allah has certainly exalted you above us, and certainly we alone were the sinners.’"
Joseph,12,92,Yusuf (Joseph) said: ‘No blame (or penalty) lies on you today. May Allah grant you His forgiveness and He is the Most Merciful of all the merciful!
Joseph,12,93,Take this shirt of mine and cast it over my father’s face; he will recover his sight. (Then) bring me the whole of your family.’
Joseph,12,94,"And when the caravan left (Egypt), his father (Ya‘qub [Jacob]) said (whilst sitting in Canaan): ‘If you do not consider me unstable due to senility, I am smelling the fragrance of Yusuf (Joseph).’"
Joseph,12,95,"They said: ‘By Allah, you are certainly in the (same) ecstasy of your (old) love.’"
Joseph,12,96,"But when the bearer of the glad tidings arrived, and he cast that shirt over Ya‘qub’s (Jacob’s) face, his sight returned at that same moment. Ya‘qub (Jacob) said: ‘Did I not say to you that I know from Allah what you do not know?’"
Joseph,12,97,"They said: ‘O our father, seek for us forgiveness (from Allah) for our sins. Indeed, we alone are the sinners.’"
Joseph,12,98,"Ya‘qub (Jacob) said: ‘Soon shall I pray to my Lord for forgiveness for you. Indeed, He alone is Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful.’"
Joseph,12,99,"Then, when they (all the members of the family) came to Yusuf (Joseph, he presented them a reception outside the city in the form of a royal procession comprising extensive transport arrangements, soldiers and general public, and) he venerated his parents and made them sit beside him, (or embraced them,) and (offering them welcome) said: ‘Enter Egypt, and if Allah so wills (then stay here) with peace and comfort.’"
Joseph,12,100,"And he seated his parents on the throne and they (all) fell down prostrate before Yusuf (Joseph) and Yusuf (Joseph) said: ‘O father, this is the interpretation of (that) dream of mine which I had seen (long) before. (Most commentators state that it took forty years.) And my Lord has surely proved it true. And indeed He did me a (great) favour when He took me out of the prison and brought all of you (here) from the desert after Satan had stirred up discord between me and my brothers. The fact is that my Lord makes easy with (His) plan whatever He wills. Indeed, He alone is All-Knowing, Most Wise."
Joseph,12,101,"O my Lord! Verily, You granted me dominion and blessed me with the knowledge of the interpretation of dreams. O Creator of the heavens and the earth! You are my Helper in this world and in the Hereafter (as well). Make me die in a state of total submission to (the Din [Religion] of) Islam, and make me join the company of those who are upright.’"
Joseph,12,102,"(O My Esteemed Beloved!) This (narrative) is of the news of the unseen which We are revealing to you, and you were not present with them when they (Yusuf’s [Joseph’s] brothers) were co-working to conclude their conspiracy and were plotting to deceive."
Joseph,12,103,And most people will not believe even if you (so ardently) desire.
Joseph,12,104,And you do not ask for any reward from them for this (communicating and preaching the Message). This Qur’an is but a reminder to all mankind.
Joseph,12,105,"And how many a sign is there in the heavens and the earth, which these people pass by, but they are heedless of them!"
Joseph,12,106,"And most of them do not believe in Allah, but that they are polytheists."
Joseph,12,107,"Have they gone free from this fear that a prevailing calamity of Allah’s torment will come upon them, or the Last Hour will seize them all of a sudden whilst they have no news of it?"
Joseph,12,108,"(O Glorious Beloved!) Say: ‘This is my way. I invite towards Allah. I am (firm and committed to) my vision and insight, I and also he who complies with me. And far Exalted is Allah, and I am not of the polytheists.’"
Joseph,12,109,"And before you We also sent men alone from amongst the inhabitants of (various) towns to whom We sent Revelations. Have they not travelled in the land so that they might (themselves) witness what was the end of those before them? And surely, the home in the Hereafter has far greater value for the Godfearing. Do you not have reason?"
Joseph,12,110,"Until, when the Messengers despaired (of their disobedient people,) and those denying communities developed this scepticism that they were told a lie (i.e., they will not be tormented), Our help reached the Messengers. Then We delivered whom We willed. And Our torment is not averted from the people committed to do evil."
Joseph,12,111,"Truly, in their stories there is a lesson of warning for men of understanding. This (Qur’an) is not a Revelation that can be forged, but a confirmation of those (revealed Books) which were revealed before it, an explanation of everything and guidance and mercy for those who believe."
The Thunder,13,1,"Alif, Lam, Mim, Ra. (Only Allah and the Messenger [blessings and peace be upon him] know the real meaning.) These are the Verses of the Book of Allah, and whatever has been revealed to you from your Lord is the truth, but most people do not believe."
The Thunder,13,2,"Allah is He Who has raised the heavens aloft (in space) without pillars (as) you see; then He established His authority on the Throne (encompassing the entire universe befitting His glory) and fettered the sun and the moon to a system, each moving (in its respective orbit to complete its rotation) during its appointed term. He alone devises strategies for the total system (of the entire universe), and vividly manifests (all the) signs (or the laws of nature) so that you may develop firm faith in appearing before your Lord."
The Thunder,13,3,"And He is the One Who spread out the earth (despite its being round) and brought about mountains and rivers in it and produced pairs of (genders) two each amongst all kinds of fruits (as well. He is the One Who) stretches the cover of the night over the day. Indeed, there are (many) signs in it for those who meditate."
The Thunder,13,4,"And there are, in the earth, tracts (of different kinds) that are adjacent to each other and the gardens of grapes and crops and palm trees, clustered and non-clustered. All these are irrigated with the same water. And (despite that) We make some of them superior to others in taste. Verily, there are (great) signs in it for the people who apply reason."
The Thunder,13,5,"And if you are surprised (at the denial of the disbelievers), then (more) surprising is that they say: ‘What, when we become dust (after death), shall we then be created anew?’ They are the ones who deny their Lord, and they alone will have shackles around their necks. And they are the ones who are the inmates of Hell. They will reside in it forever."
The Thunder,13,6,"And they hasten to demand from you punishment before mercy though many torments have passed before them. And, (O Beloved,) your Lord is Most Forgiving to the people despite their (oppression and) injustice. But certainly, your Lord is Severe in punishment (as well)."
The Thunder,13,7,And the disbelievers say: ‘Why has any sign not been sent down to this (Messenger) from his Lord?’ (O My Glorious Messenger!) You are only a warner (to the disobedient of their evil consequences) and a provider of guidance to every community (of the world).
The Thunder,13,8,"Allah knows what every female bears in her womb, and how much the wombs contract and how much they distend, and with Him is everything in a fixed measure."
The Thunder,13,9,"He is the Knower of the unseen and the seen, the Most Great (and) the Most Exalted."
The Thunder,13,10,"He amongst you who talks in a low voice, and the other who talks in a loud voice, and he who is hidden in (the darkness of) the night, and he who moves about in the day(light), all are alike (to Him)."
The Thunder,13,11,"For (every) human being there are (angels) coming in succession who, before him and behind him, guard him by the command of Allah. Verily, Allah does not change the state of a people until they bring about a change in themselves. And when Allah intends to torment a people (due to their own evil works), then none can avert it. Nor is there any helper for them apart from Allah."
The Thunder,13,12,"He is the One Who, to rouse in you (sometimes) fear and (some other times) hope, shows you lightning, and (at times) raises (rain-laden) heavy clouds."
The Thunder,13,13,"And the thunder (of clouds and lightning or the angel appointed over it) and all angels glorify Him with His praise out of His fear. And He sends thunderbolts and strikes with them whom He wills. And they (the disbelievers, despite these signs of His Might,) dispute about Allah. And He is Stern in strategy and Severe in grip."
The Thunder,13,14,"Calling towards the truth (i.e., the Oneness of Allah) is for Him alone. And those (false gods—idols) they (disbelievers) worship besides Him cannot give them any answer at all. Their example is like the one who (sits) stretching both his palms towards water so that it may reach his mouth (itself), but it (the water) reaches not (like this). And (in like manner) the praying of disbelievers (to idols and their idol-worship) is but a distraction."
The Thunder,13,15,"And whoever is in the heavens and the earth prostrates himself before Allah, (some) willingly and (others) perforce, and their shadows (too prostrate themselves before Him) morning and evening. (Then why do the disbelievers do idol-worship, turning away from Allah?)"
The Thunder,13,16,"Say(to these disbelievers): ‘Who is the Sustainer of the heavens and the earth?’ Say (yourself): ‘Allah.’ (Again) ask (them): ‘Have you taken besides Allah (these idols) as your protectors who cannot control any profit or loss even for themselves?’ Say: ‘Can the blind and the seeing be equal? Or can darkness and light be the same? Have they associated such partners with Allah that have also created (some creation) themselves similar to that of Allah, so this creation (created by these idols) has caused them doubt of resemblance (i.e., error of judgment that they too could create as Allah does)?’ Say: ‘Allah alone is the Creator of everything. And He is One. He is Dominant over all.’"
The Thunder,13,17,"He sends down water from the sky and the valleys flow according to their (respective) capacity. Then the floodwater carries the scum raised to the surface. And the items that are heated in the fire for making ornaments or other articles also have foam that comes up the same way. Thus Allah illustrates examples of the truth and falsehood. So, (whether produced by water or by fire,) the foam or scum passes away useless, but what is beneficial to the people endures in the earth. That is how Allah illustrates examples."
The Thunder,13,18,"For those who accept the command of their Lord, there is the excellent outcome. And those who reject His command, even though they possess all that is in the earth, and the like of it added to that, and they offer it as ransom (to be delivered from the torment, even then) they are the ones whose accountability will be horrible. And Hell is their abode, and that is a wretched abode."
The Thunder,13,19,"Someone who knows that whatever has been revealed to you is the truth, can he be like the one who is blind? Truly it is only those endowed with wisdom who accept admonition,"
The Thunder,13,20,"Those who fulfil their pledge to Allah and do not breach their covenant,"
The Thunder,13,21,"And who keep unified all (i.e., fulfil all their obligations to Allah, to the Messenger [blessings and peace be upon him], to humanity at large and to their close relatives) that Allah has enjoined to be unified and remain in a state of fear from Allah and dread an evil reckoning;"
The Thunder,13,22,"And who remain steadfast in seeking the pleasure of their Lord, and establish Prayer, and spend (both) secretly and openly out of the sustenance We have provided, and continue eliminating evil by means of good; they are the ones for whom there is a (beautiful) home in the Hereafter."
The Thunder,13,23,"(There) are evergreen gardens. They will enter them with the pious from amongst their ancestors, their wives and their children. And the angels will come to them through every door (of Paradise)."
The Thunder,13,24,"(Greeting, they will say:) ‘Peace be upon you as a reward for your patience! So (see now) what a beautiful home the Hereafter is!’"
The Thunder,13,25,"And those who break the promise of Allah after making it firm and sever all (the relations and obligations) that Allah has commanded to be kept unified, and do mischief and strife in the land—upon them is the curse and for them is an evil home;"
The Thunder,13,26,"Allah releases the provision abundantly for whom He pleases and restrains (for whom He wills). And these (disbelievers) are greatly charmed by the worldly life whereas, in contrast with the life in the Hereafter, the worldly life is nothing but a worthless provision."
The Thunder,13,27,"And the disbelievers say: ‘Why has any sign not been sent down to him (the Messenger) from his Lord?’ Say: ‘Verily, Allah (despite the signs) holds astray whom He wills, and leads him who turns to Him in repentance towards Himself."
The Thunder,13,28,Those who believe and their hearts become calm and contented with the remembrance of Allah—know that it is the remembrance of Allah alone that brings calm to the hearts.
The Thunder,13,29,"Those who believe and do pious works, for them there are pleasures and rejoicing and an excellent abode (in the Hereafter).’"
The Thunder,13,30,(O Beloved!) Thus We have sent you (as a Messenger) to an Umma (Community) before whom in fact (all) the communities have passed. (This is now the last of all the communities) so that you may recite to them that (Book) which We have revealed to you. And they are still denying al-Rahman (the Most Kind Lord). Say: ‘He is my Lord. There is no God but He. In Him have I put my trust and I turn towards Him alone.’
The Thunder,13,31,"And if there were a Qur’an by which mountains could be set in motion, or by which the earth could be split open, or by which the dead could be spoken to (even then they would not believe in it). But all matters are under the control of Allah. Have the believers not yet perceived that if Allah had so willed, He would have guided all mankind? And (some) disaster will continue afflicting the disbelievers due to their misdeeds, or will be alighting close to their homes (i.e., towns) until Allah’s promise (of torment) comes to pass. Surely, Allah does not go against His promise."
The Thunder,13,32,And indeed the Messengers were mocked (by the disbelievers) before you (as well). So I granted the disbelievers respite and then seized them (with torment). (See) then how My torment was!
The Thunder,13,33,"He (Allah) Who is watching the conduct of every soul and (these idols that the disbelievers) have made peers to Allah—(can they be alike? No way!) Say: ‘(Just) name them. (You fools!) Do you inform Him (Allah) of something whose (existence) He does not know in the whole earth? Or is it all (mere) superficial talk (which has no contact with reality)?’ Rather (the truth is that) the deceptive scheme of the disbelievers has been made fascinating to them, and they have been hindered from the (straight) path. And he whom Allah holds strayed, there is none who can be his guide."
The Thunder,13,34,"There is for them a chastisement in the worldly life (as well), but certainly the torment in the Hereafter is fiercer. And there is none who can rescue them from (the punishment of) Allah."
The Thunder,13,35,"A glimpse of the Paradise that has been promised to the Godfearing (depicts that) it has rivers flowing under it; its fruits are everlasting, and so is its shade. This is (the beauty of) the end of those who adopt Godwariness. And the end of the disbelievers is the Fire of Hell."
The Thunder,13,36,"And those whom We have given the Book (the Torah, if they are true believers, then) they rejoice at this (Qur’an) which has been revealed to you. And also some from amongst their sects are those who deny a part of it. Say: ‘I have been given the command to worship Allah and not to associate (any) partner with Him. I invite towards Him alone, and to Him I shall return.’"
The Thunder,13,37,"And in like manner, We have revealed this (Qur’an) as a commandment in the Arabic language. And, (O listener,) if you follow the desires of these (disbelievers) after the (conclusive) knowledge has reached you, then there is no helper or protector for you against Allah."
The Thunder,13,38,"And, (O Messenger,) indeed We sent before you (many) Messengers and brought up for them wives and children (as well). And that is not the role of a Messenger to bring a sign but by Allah’s command. There is an inscription for every appointed term."
The Thunder,13,39,Allah erases whatever (writing) He wills and confirms (whatever He wills). And with Him alone is the Real Book (the Protected Tablet [al-Lawh al-Mahfuz]).
The Thunder,13,40,"And whether We show you (during your visible life) a portion (of the torment) that We have promised these (disbelievers), or We lift you (before that-both these options are subject to Our Will). Your assignment is only to communicate (the commandments) and accountability rests with Us."
The Thunder,13,41,Do they not see that We are persistently reducing the land (under their control—most of the areas under their rule are gradually accepting the Islamic Rule)? And Allah is the One Who decrees; there is none who can undo His decree. And He is Swift in calling to account.
The Thunder,13,42,"And no doubt, those who have passed before them also indulged in deceitful plots. So the power to reverse all these plots (also) rests with Allah. He knows best what every soul is busy earning, and the disbelievers will soon come to know for whom is the home of the Hereafter!"
The Thunder,13,43,"And the disbelievers say: ‘You are not a Messenger.’ Say: ‘Sufficient is Allah as a Witness between you and me (on my Messengership), as well as the one who possesses the knowledge of the (revealed) Book.’"
Abraham,14,1,"Alif, Lam, Ra. (Only Allah and the Messenger [blessings and peace be upon him] know the real meaning.) It is a (glorious) Book which We have revealed to you so that you may bring mankind out of the darkness (of disbelief) to the light (of faith. And moreover) by the command of their Lord, (lead them) to the path of the Almighty, the Praiseworthy—"
Abraham,14,2,"Allah, to Whom belongs (all) that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. And there is destruction for the disbelievers on account of a severe punishment."
Abraham,14,3,"They are the people who love the life of this world more than the Hereafter, and hinder (the people) from the path of Allah, and look for crookedness in it (the True Din [Religion]). They (have fallen) deep into error."
Abraham,14,4,"And We have not sent any Messenger but with the language of his people so that he may make (the message of the truth) more and more clear to them. Then Allah holds astray whom He wills and provides with guidance whom He wills. And He is Almighty, Most Wise."
Abraham,14,5,"And indeed, We sent Musa (Moses) with Our signs: ‘(O Musa [Moses],) bring your people out of the darkness to the light, and remind them of the Days of Allah (which had come upon them and their preceding generations).’ Surely, there are signs in it for those who are highly steadfast (and) deeply grateful."
Abraham,14,6,"And (recall) when Musa (Moses) said to his people: ‘Recall (that) blessing of Allah conferred upon you when He delivered you from the people of Pharaoh who used to afflict you with severe torment, slaying your male children and sparing the female ones. And in it was a great trial for you from your Lord.’"
Abraham,14,7,"And (recall) when your Lord proclaimed: ‘If you are thankful, I shall certainly increase (My blessings on) you, and if you are ungrateful, then My torment is surely severe.’"
Abraham,14,8,"And Musa (Moses) said: ‘If you and all others on earth disbelieve, then Allah is indeed Self-Sufficient, Most Praisworthy.’"
Abraham,14,9,"Has the account of those who have passed away before you not reached you? They were the people of Nuh (Noah) and (of the communities) of ‘Ad and Thamud and (others) who came after them. No one knows them except Allah (because they have been totally annihilated from the surface of the earth). Their Messengers came to them with clear signs. So they put their hands into their mouths (out of mockery and spite) and (dared) say: ‘We deny this (Din [Religion]) which you have been sent with, and we are certainly in disquieting doubt about what you invite us to.’"
Abraham,14,10,"Their Messengers said: ‘Do you have doubt about Allah, Who is the Creator of the heavens and the earth, (Who) calls you so that He forgives your sins for you, and (despite your disobedience) gives you respite for a fixed term?’ They (the disbelievers) said: ‘You are but human beings like us. You seek to hold us back from these (idols) our fathers used to worship. So bring us some clear proof.’"
Abraham,14,11,"Their Messengers said to them: ‘Though (in constitution of self) we are humans like you, but (also mark the difference that) Allah favours whom He likes of His servants. (Then how are you equal?) And (as for clear proof) it is not for us to bring you a proof without Allah’s decree, and the believers must put their trust in Allah alone."
Abraham,14,12,"And what is the matter with us that we should not put our trust in Allah, whilst He alone has shown us the paths (of guidance and success)? And we will certainly bear your persecutions with patience, and those who trust should put their trust in Allah alone.’"
Abraham,14,13,"And the disbelievers said to their Messengers: ‘We will banish you by all means from our country, or you will have to return to our faith.’ Their Lord then revealed to them: ‘We shall certainly destroy the unjust people,"
Abraham,14,14,And We shall certainly settle you in the (same) land after them. This (covenant) is for every such person that fears standing before My presence and dreads My promise (of torment).’
Abraham,14,15,"And (ultimately) the Messengers sought victory (from Allah), and every obstinate rebel met defeat and came to nothing."
Abraham,14,16,"Beyond this (devastation) is Hell (again). And he will be served with fetid water of oozing pus,"
Abraham,14,17,"Which he will take sip by sip with great difficulty, and will not be able to gulp it down the throat. And death will assail him from all sides, and he will not be able (even) to die. And that (again) will be followed by (one more) extremely grievous torment."
Abraham,14,18,The example of those who have rejected faith in their Lord is that their works are like ashes on which blows the strong wind on a stormy day—they are unable to grasp anything of the (works) that they earned. This is straying far into error.
Abraham,14,19,(O listener!) Have you not seen that Allah has created the heavens and the earth in accordance with (a strategy based on) the truth? He can annihilate you if He so wills and bring new creation (in your place).
Abraham,14,20,And this is not (in the least) difficult for Allah (to execute).
Abraham,14,21,"And (on the Day of Grand Assembly) all (the higher and the lower ranks) will appear before Allah. The weak ones (the followers) will ask the (powerful) arrogant ones: ‘We obeyed you (the whole life). So can you now manage for us some degree of rescue from Allah’s torment?’ Those (affluent ones) will reply (to their poor followers): ‘Had Allah guided us, we would also have shown you the path of guidance (i.e., we were ourselves misguided so we misguided you too). It is all the same (Today) whether we sigh and wail or forbear. We have no way to escape.’"
Abraham,14,22,"And when the decision will have been given, Satan will say: ‘Indeed, Allah gave you a true promise; and I (also) promised you something, so I have violated the promise. And I had no authority over you (in the world) except that I called you (towards falsehood), so you accepted my call (for your own interest). Now do not blame me but blame your (own) selves. I can do nothing (Today) to help you out, nor can you extend any help to me. Before this you have been associating me as a partner (with Allah). Surely, I deny that (Today).’ Undoubtedly, there is a painful punishment for the wrongdoers."
Abraham,14,23,And those who believe and stick to pious deeds will be admitted to the Gardens with streams flowing under them. They will live there forever by the command of Allah. Their greeting word there (at the time of meeting) will be: ‘Peace.’
Abraham,14,24,Have you not seen how Allah sets forth an example: a good word is like a good tree? Its root is firm (in the earth) and its branches reach into the sky.
Abraham,14,25,"(That tree) yields fruit at all times by the command of its Lord, and Allah illustrates examples for the people so that they may take advice."
Abraham,14,26,"And the example of an evil word is like that of an evil tree, which is uprooted from the surface of the earth (and) which has no chance to get firm (in the soil and survive)."
Abraham,14,27,"Allah keeps the believers firm-footed in the life of this world as well as in the Hereafter with (the blessing) of this Firm Word, but Allah holds the wrongdoers astray. And Allah puts into action whatever He wills."
Abraham,14,28,Have you not seen those who have exchanged Allah’s favour (of belief) for disbelief and have lowered their people into the house of destruction?
Abraham,14,29,"(That) is Hell into which they will be thrown headlong, and that is an evil abode."
Abraham,14,30,"And they set up partners with Allah so that they may turn (the people) away from His path. Say: ‘Benefit (a few days’) gain; surely, you will end up in the Fire.’"
Abraham,14,31,"Say to My servants who have believed that they must establish Prayer and spend (in Our way) both secretly and openly of the provision that We have granted them before the dawn of the Day when neither any transaction will take place, nor any (worldly) friendship (will profit)."
Abraham,14,32,"Allah is He Who created the heavens and the earth and poured down water from the sky and then by means of this water produced fruits for you as provision. And He has made vessels subservient to you so that they may sail in the sea by Allah’s command, and He has (also) put rivers under your control."
Abraham,14,33,"And for your benefit, He has subjected the sun and the moon (to a regular system); they keep rotating (in their respective orbits). And He has also subdued the night and the day (to a system) for your (system of life)."
Abraham,14,34,"And He has given you everything that you asked Him for, and if you seek to number the favours of Allah, you will not be able to count them all. Indeed, man is highly unjust and extremely ungrateful."
Abraham,14,35,"And (recall) when Ibrahim (Abraham) submitted: ‘O my Lord, make this city (Mecca) a land of peace and keep me and my children from idol-worship."
Abraham,14,36,"O my Lord! These (idols) have led many people astray. So whoever follows me will belong to me, and whoever disobeys me, then indeed You are Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful."
Abraham,14,37,"O our Lord! Verily, I have settled my offspring (Isma‘il [Ishmael]) in the barren valley (of Mecca) in the close vicinity of Your Sacred House, O our Lord, so that they may establish Prayer. So make the hearts of the people incline towards them with love and fondness, and provide for them (all kinds of) fruits as sustenance so that they may remain grateful."
Abraham,14,38,"O our Lord! Surely, You know (all) what we hide and what we show, and there is nothing which is hidden from Allah either on earth or in the heaven."
Abraham,14,39,"All praise belongs to Allah alone, Who has bestowed upon me (two sons) in old age, Isma‘il (Ishmael) and Ishaq (Isaac). Indeed, my Lord is the All-Hearer of prayer."
Abraham,14,40,"O my Lord! Make me and my children the ones who establish Prayer; O my Lord, and grant my prayer."
Abraham,14,41,O my Lord! Forgive me and (forgive) my parents* and all the believers as well on the Day when reckoning (and accountability) will be held.’
Abraham,14,42,And never think of Allah to be unaware of the works the wrongdoers are doing. He is only giving them (the wrongdoers) respite till the Day on which the eyes will be stare-fixed (in horror).
Abraham,14,43,"Their heads lifted up, they will be running (towards the Field of Grand Assembly), with eyes unable to twinkle and with hearts being drained of strength."
Abraham,14,44,"And warn the people of the Day when the torment will come upon them. Those who did injustice will say: ‘O our Lord, grant us respite for a while so that we may accept Your message and follow the Messengers.’ (It will be said to them:) ‘Are you not those who used to swear before that you would never fall?’"
Abraham,14,45,"And (in your own turn) you were dwelling in the palaces (vacated by) those who had wronged their souls (during their respective eras), whereas this had dawned on you how We had dealt with them, and We also elucidated examples for your (easy comprehension)."
Abraham,14,46,"And (having lost their balance, intoxicated by wealth and power,) they hatched many plots, whilst Allah had the countermeasures to foil all their plots, although their deceitful strategies were sufficient even to uproot the mountains."
Abraham,14,47,"So never think that Allah will break His promise with His Messengers. Indeed, Allah is Almighty, the Lord of Retribution."
Abraham,14,48,"The Day when (this) earth will be changed into a different earth and all the heavens will also be changed and the entire mankind will appear before Allah, the One, (and) the Dominant over all;"
Abraham,14,49,And that Day you will see the sinners fettered in chains;
Abraham,14,50,"Their garments will be of pitch (or some inflammable oil), and the Fire will be enveloping their faces,"
Abraham,14,51,"So that Allah requites every soul for (the deeds) it has earned. Indeed, Allah is Swift in Reckoning."
Abraham,14,52,"This (Qur’an) is perfect communication of the Message to mankind so that by means of this they may be warned, and that they may conscientiously bear in mind that He (Allah) is One God, and that those who possess wisdom may take advice."
Al-Hijr,15,1,"Alif, Lam, Ra. (Only Allah and the Messenger [blessings and peace be upon him] know the real meaning.) These are the Verses of the (Glorious) Book and the Enlightening Qur’an."
Al-Hijr,15,2,"(Watching the scenes of Allah’s mercy on the believers in the Hereafter,) the disbelievers will persistently aspire: would that they were Muslims!"
Al-Hijr,15,3,(Feel not aggrieved.) Leave them. Let them eat (and drink) and make merry and let (their) false hopes keep them negligent (of the Hereafter). Then they will come to know (their end) soon.
Al-Hijr,15,4,"And never have We destroyed any township, except that there was for them a known inscription (law, which they violated and met their fate)."
Al-Hijr,15,5,"No people can go beyond their appointed term, nor can they step back (under the law of rise and fall)."
Al-Hijr,15,6,"And (the disbelievers) say (insolently): ‘O man on whom this Qur’an has been revealed, indeed you are insane."
Al-Hijr,15,7,Why do you not bring us angels if you are truthful?’
Al-Hijr,15,8,"We do not send down angels but with the (judgment of) truth (i.e., We send them down to execute the torment when its time approaches), and they are not granted respite at that time."
Al-Hijr,15,9,"Assuredly, We alone have revealed this Glorious Admonition (the Qur’an), and surely We alone will guard it."
Al-Hijr,15,10,And We indeed sent Messengers before you as well amongst the earlier generations.
Al-Hijr,15,11,And there did not come to them any Messenger but they would mock him.
Al-Hijr,15,12,That is how We infuse this (mockery and ridicule) into the hearts of the sinners;
Al-Hijr,15,13,"These people will not believe in this (Qur’an), and (this) is what has been the practice of the bygone people."
Al-Hijr,15,14,"And if We open to them some gate in the heaven (and also make this possible for them that) they keep ascending through (it) the whole day,"
Al-Hijr,15,15,"(Even then) they will certainly say (this): ‘Our eyes have been hypnotized (through some magic trick and deceit), rather we are spellbound.’"
Al-Hijr,15,16,"And indeed, We brought into existence constellations in the heavens (in the form of galaxies to safeguard the planets), and adorned this (spatial universe) for the beholders."
Al-Hijr,15,17,"And We have ensured the protection of this (system of heavenly universe) from every outcast satan (i.e., from the destructive phenomenon of every rebellious force)."
Al-Hijr,15,18,"But anyone who tries to eavesdrop, an illuminating (i.e., blazing) meteor follows it."
Al-Hijr,15,19,"And We have spread out the earth (despite its being round), and We brought about firm mountains in it (by allying different elements together), and in it We provided means of growth to all species in (requisite) proportion."
Al-Hijr,15,20,"And in it We generated for you means of subsistence and also for those (human beings, animals and birds) whom you do not provide for."
Al-Hijr,15,21,"And there is not a thing (in the universe) but that We have its treasures with Us, and We send it down only according to a fixed quantity."
Al-Hijr,15,22,"And We send winds carrying the burden of clouds. Then We pour down water from the sky. Then it is you whom We give it to drink, and it is not you who maintain its reservoirs."
Al-Hijr,15,23,"And indeed, We alone give life and cause death, and We alone are the Inheritor (and the Owner of all)."
Al-Hijr,15,24,"And surely, We know those who lived before you, and We also know those who will come after you."
Al-Hijr,15,25,"Verily, it is your Lord Who will gather them together (on the Day of Resurrection). Surely, He is Most Wise, All-Knowing."
Al-Hijr,15,26,"And indeed, We originated man’s (chemical) genesis from that dry sounding clay which, (first) having grown old (and under the heat of the sun and other chemical and biological effects), had turned into black stinking mud."
Al-Hijr,15,27,And We created jinn before this from a smokeless blazing fire.
Al-Hijr,15,28,"And (recall) when your Lord said to the angels: ‘I am about to create a human organism from old (and) black stinking, resounding mud."
Al-Hijr,15,29,"So when I accomplish the perfection of his (physical) constitution into his real being, and breathe My (divine) spirit into (the inner self of) this (human physical) organism, then fall down prostrate before him.’"
Al-Hijr,15,30,"So, (no sooner did the light of Allah’s effulgence illumine the human organism than) all the angels fell down in prostration together,"
Al-Hijr,15,31,Except Iblis. He refused to join those who prostrated themselves.
Al-Hijr,15,32,"(Allah) said: ‘O Iblis, what has happened to you that you have not joined those who have prostrated themselves?’"
Al-Hijr,15,33,"(Iblis) replied: ‘I cannot be the one who should fall down prostrate before a human being You have created from old (and) black stinking, sounding mud.’"
Al-Hijr,15,34,"(Allah) said: ‘Then get out from here, for you are indeed the cursed one (the outcast)."
Al-Hijr,15,35,"And, verily, the curse will (persistently) rest upon you till the Day of Recompense.’"
Al-Hijr,15,36,"He said: ‘O Lord, then grant me respite till the Day (when) people will be raised up (again).’"
Al-Hijr,15,37,"Allah said: ‘So, indeed, you are amongst those granted respite,"
Al-Hijr,15,38,Till the Day of the appointed time (Resurrection).’
Al-Hijr,15,39,"Iblis said: ‘O Lord, because You have led me astray, I will (also) best adorn and embellish for them (the sins, revolts and violations) in the earth and will certainly lead all of them astray by all means,"
Al-Hijr,15,40,Except for those exalted servants of Yours who have attained freedom (from my deceits and intrigues of the ill-commanding selves).’
Al-Hijr,15,41,Allah said: ‘This (freedom from these deceits and intrigues) is the (very) path that leads straight to My Threshold.
Al-Hijr,15,42,"Surely, you will in no way be able to influence My servants (who have attained this freedom from you) except the misguided lot who have adopted your way."
Al-Hijr,15,43,"And verily, the promised place for all of them is Hell."
Al-Hijr,15,44,It has seven doors; for each one a fixed portion of them has been specified.’
Al-Hijr,15,45,"Indeed, the Godfearing will be amid Gardens and fountains."
Al-Hijr,15,46,"(It will be said to them:) ‘Enter them peacefully, casting aside all fears.’"
Al-Hijr,15,47,And We shall remove from their breasts all spite that they had (in the world against one another due to misunderstanding). They shall be brothers seated on couches face to face (in Paradise).
Al-Hijr,15,48,"No discomfort will touch them, nor will they be driven out from there."
Al-Hijr,15,49,"(O Beloved!) Tell My servants: ‘Indeed, I am Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful.’"
Al-Hijr,15,50,And (also warn) that: ‘It is My torment which is the most grievous torment.’
Al-Hijr,15,51,And (also) relate to them the news about the guests of Ibrahim (Abraham).
Al-Hijr,15,52,"When they came to Ibrahim (Abraham), they greeted (him with): ‘Peace.’ Ibrahim (Abraham) said: ‘We are feeling somewhat afraid of you.’"
Al-Hijr,15,53,(The guest angels) said: ‘Do not feel afraid. We give you the glad tidings of (the birth of) a son endowed with knowledge and wisdom.’
Al-Hijr,15,54,Ibrahim (Abraham) said: ‘You are giving me the glad tidings at a time when old age has already overtaken me. So what good news are you giving me now?’
Al-Hijr,15,55,They said: ‘We give you the good news which is true. So do not lose hope.’
Al-Hijr,15,56,Ibrahim (Abraham) said: ‘Who can lose hope of his Lord’s mercy except the strayed ones?’
Al-Hijr,15,57,"Ibrahim (Abraham) asked: ‘O deputed angels (sent by Allah), what other assignment do you have (to accomplish besides these glad tidings for which you have come)?’"
Al-Hijr,15,58,"They said: ‘We have been sent towards a sinful people,"
Al-Hijr,15,59,"Except the family of Lut (Lot) all of whom We will indeed save,"
Al-Hijr,15,60,With the exception of his wife. We have decided that she shall certainly be amongst those who stay back (to become the victims of the torment).’
Al-Hijr,15,61,"Then, when those deputed (angels) came to the house of Lut (Lot),"
Al-Hijr,15,62,"Lut (Lot) said: ‘Indeed, you are (looking) strangers.’"
Al-Hijr,15,63,They said: ‘(No indeed;) in fact we have come to you with the (punishment) about which these people have had doubts.
Al-Hijr,15,64,And we have brought you (the judgment of) the truth and we are certainly truthful.
Al-Hijr,15,65,"So set off with your family sometime during the night, and follow them in the rear, and none of you should (even) look back, and proceed to the place (where) you have been commanded.’"
Al-Hijr,15,66,And We informed Lut (Lot) of this judgment through Revelation that the root of these people would be cut off the moment it dawns.
Al-Hijr,15,67,"And the people of the city (possessed by their lust) approached (Lut [Lot]), rejoicing."
Al-Hijr,15,68,"Lut (Lot) said: ‘Surely, they are my guests, so do not put me to shame (about them)."
Al-Hijr,15,69,And fear (the wrath of) Allah and do not humiliate me.’
Al-Hijr,15,70,"Those (lost in wickedness) said: ‘(O Lut [Lot],) did we not forbid you (to provide protection to) all the people of the world?’"
Al-Hijr,15,71,Lut (Lot) said: ‘There are my (people’s) daughters. If you desire to do something (then marry them instead of perpetrating indecency).’
Al-Hijr,15,72,"(O Glorious Beloved!) By your (sacred) life, surely these people (too) are wandering astray, possessed by their lust (like the people of Lut [Lot])."
Al-Hijr,15,73,"So, the blazing blast seized them at sunrise."
Al-Hijr,15,74,And We turned their town upside down and rained upon them stones of baked clay.
Al-Hijr,15,75,"Verily, in this (occurrence) there are signs for those who possess the ability to probe into reality."
Al-Hijr,15,76,And truly that town lies along a frequented highway.
Al-Hijr,15,77,"Surely, in this (episode of the people of Lut [Lot]), there is a sign of (warning) for the believers."
Al-Hijr,15,78,"And, in reality, the dwellers of al-Ayka (the Thick Wood) too were hardened wrongdoers."
Al-Hijr,15,79,"So We avenged Ourselves on them (as well), and (archeological remains of) both these (towns still exist) on the highway."
Al-Hijr,15,80,"And no doubt, the people of the valley of al-Hijr (the Rock) too denied the Messengers."
Al-Hijr,15,81,"And We (also) bestowed upon them Our signs, but they persisted in turning away from them."
Al-Hijr,15,82,And they used to carve out houses in the mountains without any threat and fear.
Al-Hijr,15,83,And the dreadful blast seized them (as well) the moment it dawned.
Al-Hijr,15,84,So (the riches) they used to earn could not repel (Allah’s punishment) from them.
Al-Hijr,15,85,"And We have not created the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them without any purpose. And the Hour of Resurrection is certainly approaching. So, (O embodiment of excellent morality,) bear with (them) most graciously and effectively with perseverance."
Al-Hijr,15,86,"Indeed, your Lord alone is the Creator of all things, All-Knowing."
Al-Hijr,15,87,"And surely We have bestowed upon you the seven oft-recited Verses (i.e., Chapter al-Fatiha) and the Glorious Qur’an."
Al-Hijr,15,88,"Do not even lift your eyes towards the things with which We have benefitted the disbelievers for their (few days’) luxury, nor grieve over their (turning away from the straight path), and keep your wings (of affection and care) lowered over the believers (to make them feel contented and cared for)."
Al-Hijr,15,89,"And say: ‘Indeed, I am (now) the open and clear Warner (of Allah’s torment).’"
Al-Hijr,15,90,"The (torment) that We sent down upon the dividers (i.e., the Jews and the Christians),"
Al-Hijr,15,91,"Those who divided the Qur’an into pieces (and split it, i.e., accepted the favourable Verses but rejected the others)."
Al-Hijr,15,92,"So, by your Lord, We shall indeed interrogate them all,"
Al-Hijr,15,93,Pertaining to the works that they used to do.
Al-Hijr,15,94,"So declare openly all those (matters) that you have been commanded, and turn away from those who set up partners with Allah."
Al-Hijr,15,95,"Surely, We suffice you for (taking them to task) who scoff,"
Al-Hijr,15,96,Who set up other gods along with Allah. So they will come to know (their end) soon.
Al-Hijr,15,97,And We indeed know that your (sacred) breast feels straitened by what they say.
Al-Hijr,15,98,So glorify your Lord with His praise and live amongst those who prostrate themselves before Him.
Al-Hijr,15,99,"And worship your Lord till you attain to the station of certainty of faith (which goes with your glory, i.e., perfect cognizance of divinity or the moment of far-nearness to your Lord)."
The Bee,16,1,"The promise of Allah has drawn (near), so do not hasten in seeking it. Holy is He and Exalted far above those objects, which the disbelievers set up as (His) peers."
The Bee,16,2,"He alone sends down the angels by His command with Revelation (which is the spirit of all the teachings of Din [Religion]) to those of His servants He likes: ‘Warn (the people) that there is no God except Me, so fear Me against all evils.’"
The Bee,16,3,He alone has created the heavens and the earth with a decreed celestial order. He is Exalted far above those objects which the disbelievers set up as (His) peers.
The Bee,16,4,"He alone has created man from a drop of vital fluid, yet he has become openly contentious (instead of becoming totally submissive to Allah)."
The Bee,16,5,And He alone has created for you the cattle. They are for you a source of warm clothing and (other) benefits. And you (also) eat some of them.
The Bee,16,6,"And there is beauty in them (and also a joy—an aesthetic pleasure) for you when you drive (them back) in the evening from pasture, and when you drive (them) out in the morning (to graze)."
The Bee,16,7,"And these (animals also) carry your loads to those distant cities (and remote areas) where you cannot reach (otherwise) without toiling hard. Surely, your Lord is Most Clement, Ever-Merciful."
The Bee,16,8,"And (He is the One Who has created) horses, mules and donkeys so that you may ride them, and that they may serve as means of adornment (for you) as well, and He will (further) create (such ornamented means of conveyance) that you do not know (today)."
The Bee,16,9,"And the middle course reaches (the door of) Allah, and many crooked side tracks also (branch off) from it. And had He so willed, He would have guided all of you."
The Bee,16,10,"He is the One Who has sent down for you water from the sky. (Some) of it is to drink and (some) of it is for plantation. (You grow with it plants, vegetation and pastures) wherein you take (your cattle) to graze."
The Bee,16,11,"With the same water, He grows for you crops and olives and date-palms and grapes and all kinds of fruit. Indeed, there are signs in it for those who reflect and meditate."
The Bee,16,12,"And He (is the One Who) has subjected to your service the night and the day and the sun and the moon, and all the stars have also been made subservient to (the system according to) His strategy. Surely, there are signs in it for those who possess reason."
The Bee,16,13,"And (of the animal world, vegetable world and minerals,) whatever He has created for you in the earth which have separate colours (genders, species, classes, characteristics and benefits, etc. —all have been subdued to your service). Verily, there is a sign in it for those who take advice."
The Bee,16,14,"And He is the One Who has subjected the sea (rivers and oceans) as well (in addition to air and land) so that you may eat fresh (and favourite) seafood from there and may take out from them gems (etc.) that you wear as ornaments. And, (O man,) you see the vessels (and ships) that pierce through the water (of the rivers and oceans). And (all this has been managed) so that you may look for His bounty (i.e., sustenance, far and wide) and also that you may become thankful."
The Bee,16,15,"And He is the One Who has created firm mountains in the earth (by allying various elements) lest it tremor whilst carrying you (revolving in its orbit), and rivers and (also natural) routes so that you may find way (to reach the destinations),"
The Bee,16,16,And set up landmarks (to navigate during the day). And (at night as well) people find (their) way by means of the stars.
The Bee,16,17,"Can the Creator, Who creates (all that), be like the one who cannot create (anything)? Do you not then accept advice?"
The Bee,16,18,"And if you want to count the favours of Allah, you will not be able to number them all. Surely, Allah is Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful."
The Bee,16,19,And Allah knows what you hide and what you show.
The Bee,16,20,And the (idols) whom these (polytheists) worship besides Allah cannot create anything; they have rather been created themselves.
The Bee,16,21,"(They) are non-living, inanimate objects which do not (even) sense when the people will be raised up."
The Bee,16,22,Your God is One God. So those who do not believe in the Hereafter are deniers at heart and are beliers and arrogant.
The Bee,16,23,"This is true and established that Allah knows all that they hide and all that they show. Surely, He does not like the defiers and arrogant."
The Bee,16,24,And when they are asked: ‘What has your Lord sent down?’ they retort: ‘False fables of the people gone by (have been sent down).’
The Bee,16,25,"(They are making all these utterances) so that they may carry a full load (of their evildoings) on the Day of Resurrection, and also (carry) some of the load of those that they are misguiding due to (their) ignorance. Beware! It is an extremely evil load which they are carrying."
The Bee,16,26,"No doubt, those who lived before them (also) devised plots, but Allah knocked down the edifice (of their deceptive plots) from its foundations, and the roof caved in upon them, and the torment came at them from whence they least expected."
The Bee,16,27,"Then He will humiliate them on the Day of Resurrection and say: ‘Where are those that you set up as peers to Me, and in whose favour you disputed (with the believers)?’ Those endowed with knowledge will say: ‘Today (all types of) humiliation and destruction will surely befall the disbelievers,"
The Bee,16,28,"Those whom the angels cause to die, whilst they are (constantly) doing wrong to their own souls.’ They will display obedience and submission (on the Day of Resurrection and say:) ‘We were not given to doing any evil (in the world).’ No indeed! Allah surely has thorough knowledge of what you used to do."
The Bee,16,29,"So, enter the gates of Hell. You are its permanent residents. So how evil is the abode of the arrogant!"
The Bee,16,30,"And (when) the Godfearing are asked: ‘What has your Lord sent down?’ they say: ‘All good (for here and the Hereafter has been sent down).’ There is good for those who do good in this world (too), and certainly the abode of the Hereafter is even better. And how excellent is the abode of those who are Godfearing!"
The Bee,16,31,There are Gardens of Eternity which they will enter with streams flowing under them. Therein will be (available) whatever they will long for. That is how Allah rewards the Godfearing.
The Bee,16,32,"The angels take their lives whilst they are pure, clean, pleased and contented (due to obedience and piety. The angels tell them the moment they take their lives:) ‘Peace be upon you! Enter Paradise due to (the pious deeds) that you used to do.’"
The Bee,16,33,"And what else are they waiting for except that the angels should come to them, or there should reach the command (of torment) from your Lord? Those before them (also) did the same. And Allah did not do them any wrong, but they themselves used to wrong their own souls."
The Bee,16,34,"So the punishments that came upon them were due to the acts that they had perpetrated, and the same (chastisement) they used to make fun of engulfed them."
The Bee,16,35,"And those who set up peers with Allah say: ‘Had Allah so willed, we would not have worshipped anything apart from Him, neither we nor our fathers. Nor would we have forbidden anything without His (command).’ Those before them (also) did the same. Are the Messengers responsible for anything in addition to clearly conveying (the message and commandments of Allah)?"
The Bee,16,36,"And indeed We raised a Messenger amongst every people (saying): ‘(O people,) worship Allah and keep away from Taghut (i.e., Satan and idol-worship).’ Then some amongst them were those whom Allah guided, and there were others amongst them for whom misguidance proved (appropriate). So travel through the land and see what was the end of those who belied (the truth)!"
The Bee,16,37,"If you ardently desire them to take the path of guidance then (let not your sanctified disposition be overburdened), for indeed Allah does not guide him whom He holds strayed, nor do they have any helpers."
The Bee,16,38,"And they swear by Allah most earnestly that Allah will not resurrect him who dies. No indeed! The true promise is a bountiful obligation upon Him, but most people do not know."
The Bee,16,39,"(The dead will be raised up again) so that He makes evident (the truth) wherein they disagree, and that the disbelievers may realize that they alone are in fact liars."
The Bee,16,40,"Our command for a thing is but only this much that when We intend (to bring) it (into existence), We say to it: ‘Be,’ and it becomes."
The Bee,16,41,"And those who emigrated after they had been subjected to (different kinds of) torture and brutality, We will certainly provide them with a better abode in this (very) world. And the reward in the Hereafter is certainly greater. Would that they knew (this secret);"
The Bee,16,42,Those who remain steadfast and put their trust in their Lord!
The Bee,16,43,"And before you also, We sent only men as Messengers towards whom We sent Our Revelations. So if you yourselves do not know (anything), then ask the People of remembrance."
The Bee,16,44,"(They too were sent) with clear proofs and the Books. And, (O Glorious Messenger,) We have revealed to you the Glorious Reminder (the Qur’an) so that you may explain clearly to people (the message and the commandments) that have been sent down to them and that they may meditate."
The Bee,16,45,"Have these evil and deceitful people gone free of the fear that Allah may sink them into the earth, or may send them torment from (any) quarter that is beyond their imagination?"
The Bee,16,46,"Or He may seize them during their movements (travelling and business trips). So, they cannot hinder Allah."
The Bee,16,47,"Or He may seize them for being struck with fear. Indeed, your Lord is Most Compassionate, Ever-Merciful."
The Bee,16,48,"Have they not seen those (shady) objects that Allah has created; their shadows keep crawling on the right and the left sides, prostrating themselves before Allah? And, (in fact, in this way) they display humbleness and obedience."
The Bee,16,49,"And whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth, all living beings and angels prostrate themselves before Allah (alone), and are not (a bit) proud and arrogant."
The Bee,16,50,"They keep fearing their Lord, Who is high above them, and obey whatever command they are given."
The Bee,16,51,"And Allah has ordained: ‘Do not take two gods; assuredly, He (Allah) alone is the only One God. So fear Me alone persistently.’"
The Bee,16,52,"And whatever is in the heavens and the earth (all) belongs to Him alone, and obedience to Him alone is obligatory (for all). Do you then fear (anyone) other than Allah?"
The Bee,16,53,"And whatever blessing you have been provided with is from Allah alone. Then, when some distress afflicts you, you wail and weep only before Him."
The Bee,16,54,"Then, when Allah removes that distress from you, a party from amongst you starts setting up partners with their Lord;"
The Bee,16,55,"(This disbelief and polytheism is perpetrated) so that they may show ingratitude for those (blessings) which We have bestowed upon them. So, (O polytheists,) take this (a few days’) benefit, then soon will you know (your end)."
The Bee,16,56,"And they ascribe a portion of the provisions which We have given them to those (idols) whose (reality) even they themselves do not know. By Allah, you will indeed be asked about what you fabricate."
The Bee,16,57,"And they (the disbelievers and polytheists) ascribe daughters to Allah—Glory be to Him (He is far above that)!—and for themselves they prefer what they desire (i.e., sons)."
The Bee,16,58,"And when the news (of the birth) of a daughter is disclosed to any of them, his face turns dark and he gets pent up with anger."
The Bee,16,59,"He seeks to hide himself from people due to the (presumed) bad news that is given to him. (He now gets down to thinking) whether he should keep her (alive) despite humiliation and disgrace, or bury her (alive) in the earth. See! How wicked is the decision that they make!"
The Bee,16,60,"(This) is the most evil attribute of those who do not believe in the Hereafter and the most exalted attribute is only Allah’s. And He is Almighty, Most Wise."
The Bee,16,61,"And had Allah seized people (instantly) for their injustice, He would not have left any living being (on the surface of the earth). But He grants them respite till an appointed term. When their fixed time arrives, then they can neither advance, nor hold it back for a single moment."
The Bee,16,62,"And they attribute to Allah what they loathe (for themselves), and their tongues utter falsehood that there is good for them. (No indeed!) The truth is that for them there is Hell, and they will be the first ones to be sent (into Hell where they shall be left forever)."
The Bee,16,63,By Allah! We certainly sent Messengers to (many) communities before you (also). Then Satan made their (evil) deeds look attractive and pleasing to them. So the same (Satan) is Today their friend. And for them there is painful punishment.
The Bee,16,64,And We have not revealed to you the Book except that you may explain clearly to them those (matters) in which they differ; and (also that this Book) is guidance and mercy for the people that have embraced faith.
The Bee,16,65,"And Allah pours down water from the sky, and by means of that brings the earth to life (i.e., makes it fertile and green) after it has become dead (i.e., barren and infertile). Surely, there is in it a sign for those who give ear (to advice)."
The Bee,16,66,And indeed in the cattle (too) there is a point for you to ponder. We provide you with pure milk to drink brought forth from that substance of their bellies (which is produced by) compounding (certain) intestinal contents and blood and which freshens up those who drink it.
The Bee,16,67,"And from the fruits of date-palms and grapes, you obtain sugar and (other) wholesome foods. Indeed, there is a sign in it for those who have reason."
The Bee,16,68,And your Lord seeded (the idea instinctually) in the honeybee’s heart: ‘Make your hives in certain mountains and certain trees and (also) in certain projections people build aloft (like roofs).
The Bee,16,69,"So, suck the juice of all kinds of fruit, and then follow those routes (suggested) by your Lord (which lead to these fruits and flowers of which you are to suck the juice, leading other bees also to the source) for their convenience.’ There oozes from their bellies a syrup (i.e., honey) of diverse colours. It has healing properties for the people. Therein is indeed a sign for those who apply their minds."
The Bee,16,70,"And Allah has brought you into being; then He causes you to die; and He turns some of you to the most worthless age (i.e., senility) so that after knowing (so much in life) he should now know nothing (i.e., man may see to his helplessness and paucity of resources before death). Surely, Allah is All-Knowing, All-Powerful."
The Bee,16,71,"And Allah has preferred some of you to others in (grades of) provision (so that He puts you to trial through the command of spending in His way). But those who have been preferred do not divert (even a portion of) their wealth to (i.e., do not spend on) their dependants, whilst they all are equal in it (as for as their basic necessities are concerned). So do they deny Allah’s favour?"
The Bee,16,72,"And Allah has created for you spouses from amongst yourselves, and has created through your mates (i.e., wives) sons and grandsons and provided you with pure sustenance. Do they still believe in falsehood (abandoning the truth) and disregard Allah’s favours?"
The Bee,16,73,"And besides Allah, they worship those (idols) who are helpless to provide them with any provision from the heavens and the earth, nor do they have any power."
The Bee,16,74,"So never put forward any similitude about Allah. Surely, Allah knows and you do not."
The Bee,16,75,"Allah has explained an example (that) there is a slave, possessed by (some master), having no control over anything (himself), and (the other) is the one to whom We have given the best provision, so he gives out to others out of it secretly and openly: can the two be held equal? All praise belongs to Allah alone. But most of them do not know (even the basic reality)."
The Bee,16,76,"And Allah has illustrated an example of two (such) men of whom one is dumb, has no power over anything and is a burden on his master; wherever he (the master) sends him, he brings no good. Can he (the dumb) be equal to the (other) one who (holds such an office that he) enjoins the people to do justice, and he himself also follows the straight path?"
The Bee,16,77,"And to Allah belongs (all) the unseen of the heavens and the earth, and the advent of the Last Hour will be as quick as a twinkling of an eye or even faster. Surely, Allah has mighty control over everything."
The Bee,16,78,"And Allah brought you forth from the wombs of your mothers (in such a state) that you knew nothing, and He endowed you with ears and eyes and hearts so that you might give thanks."
The Bee,16,79,"Have they not seen the birds that fly aloft in the air (under the law of motion and aerodynamics)? Nothing but (the laws of) Allah hold them (in the sky). Surely, there are signs in (this law of aerodynamics) for the believers."
The Bee,16,80,"And Allah has made your homes (permanent) places for you to reside and made for you (temporary) dwellings (i.e., tents) with the skins of cattle which you find light enough during your journey and for (reposing at break-journey) halts. And (Allah is the One Who) provides you with household goods and profitable means (in business and trade) from the wool of sheep and lambs and the fur of camels and hair obtained from goats (which are) for an appointed term."
The Bee,16,81,"And Allah is the One Who has made for you shades of many things that He created, and He has made places of shelter for you in the mountains, and He has made such clothes for you that protect you from heat and (others like) coats of armour, which shield you (against the enemy assault) during the event of intense war. Thus Allah perfects His favour and blessing (i.e., provision and protection) upon you so that you may bow down (before His presence) with absolute submissiveness."
The Bee,16,82,"So if (even then) they turn away, (O Glorious Messenger,) then your responsibility is only to convey and communicate (My message and My commands) clearly."
The Bee,16,83,"They recognize Allah’s favour, then deny it and most of them are disbelievers."
The Bee,16,84,"And the Day when We shall raise from every people (their Messenger as) a witness (to their deeds), then the disbelievers will not be accorded permission (to put forward any excuse), nor will they be asked (then) to turn to Allah in repentance."
The Bee,16,85,"And when the wrongdoers see the torment, neither will (this torment) be mitigated for them, nor will they be granted any respite."
The Bee,16,86,"And when the idolaters see their (self-made) partners, they will say: ‘O our Lord, these are our partner-gods which we worshipped besides You.’ Thereupon those (partner-gods) will send them the message (in reply): ‘You are liars indeed.’"
The Bee,16,87,"And that Day, these (polytheists) will show humbleness and obedience to Allah, and all falsehood that they used to fabricate will vanish from them."
The Bee,16,88,"Those who disbelieved and persistently hindered (others) from the path of Allah, We shall add torment to their torment because they used to spread mischief and spoil peace."
The Bee,16,89,"And (this) will be the Day (when) We shall raise amongst every people one witness against them from themselves, and, (O Venerable Beloved,) We shall bring you as witness to all of them (communities and Messengers). And We have revealed to you that Glorious Book which is a clear exposition of everything and is guidance, mercy and glad tidings for the believers."
The Bee,16,90,"Indeed, Allah enjoins justice and benevolence (towards everyone), and giving away to the kindred, and forbids indecency, evil deeds, defiance and disobedience. He admonishes you so that you may remember with concern."
The Bee,16,91,"And always fulfil the promise of Allah when you promise, and do not break oaths after making them firm, whilst you have already made Allah a surety over you. Surely, Allah knows well whatever you do."
The Bee,16,92,"And do not be like the woman who, after spinning her yarn firm and strong, breaks it into pieces. You employ your oaths as a means of deceiving amongst you so that (by this) one party may earn more profit than the other. The matter is that Allah (also) puts you to trial through the same, and on the Day of Resurrection He will certainly make clear those matters in which you used to disagree."
The Bee,16,93,"And had Allah so willed, He would have made (all) of you one Umma (Community) but He holds strayed whom He wills and leads to guidance whom He wills. And you will surely be asked about the deeds you used to do."
The Bee,16,94,"And do not use your oaths as a means of deceiving amongst you lest your foot should quiver after it is set firmly (in Islam), and you will taste the evil result because you used to hinder (the people) from the path of Allah. And there is severe torment for you."
The Bee,16,95,"And do not barter the promise made to Allah for a paltry price (i.e., worldly wealth and gains). Surely, (the reward) that is with Allah is best for you if you know (this secret)."
The Bee,16,96,"The (riches) that you possess will be no more and what is with Allah will last. And those who remain steadfast, We shall certainly pay their recompense for their righteous deeds which they used to do."
The Bee,16,97,"Whoever performs pious works, man or woman, provided he or she is a believer, We will surely let such a person live a life of purity, and will indeed reward them (as well) their wage of the righteous works which they used to do."
The Bee,16,98,"So when you undertake to recite the Qur’an, seek refuge with Allah against (the wiles of) Satan, the outcast."
The Bee,16,99,"Surely, he has no control (at all) over those who believe and put their trust in their Lord."
The Bee,16,100,He overpowers only those who make friends with him and who associate partners with Allah.
The Bee,16,101,"And when We substitute some Verse in place of another Verse, and Allah (alone) knows best whatever He sends down, (then) the disbelievers say: ‘You are but a forger!’ But most of them do not know (the rationale of sending down and substituting the Verses)."
The Bee,16,102,"Say: ‘The Holy Spirit (Gabriel) has brought it (the Qur’an) down from your Lord with truth so as to keep the believers firm-footed, and (this) is guidance and good news for the believers.’"
The Bee,16,103,"And indeed, We know that they (the disbelievers and the polytheists) say: ‘It is but a human being who teaches him this (Qur’an).’ But the person they point to, turning the matter away from the truth, is the one whose language is non-Arabic and this Qur’an is (in) a clear and unambiguous Arabic language."
The Bee,16,104,"Surely, those who do not believe in the Revelations of Allah, Allah does not provide them with guidance (i.e., does not enable them to have understanding and insight). And for them is a grievous torment."
The Bee,16,105,"Indeed, they alone who do not believe in the Revelations of Allah invent false fabrications and they alone are liars."
The Bee,16,106,"The one who disbelieves after having believed, except someone who is coercively forced to do so, and at heart remains contented with belief (as before), but (of course) he who (adopts) disbelief (afresh) wholeheartedly with an open mind, on them is a wrath from Allah and for them is a fierce torment."
The Bee,16,107,"That is because they loved and preferred the life of this world to the Hereafter, and because Allah does not guide the disbelieving folk."
The Bee,16,108,"They are those whose hearts and whose ears and whose eyes Allah has sealed, and they are the ones who are neglectful (of their end in the Hereafter)."
The Bee,16,109,It is a fact that these are certainly those who are the losers in the Hereafter.
The Bee,16,110,"Then your Lord—for those who emigrated (i.e., left their homes and towns for the cause of Allah) after they had been made to suffer from trials (and atrocities at the hands of militant and tyrant disbelievers), then fought in the way of Allah and remained steadfast (in the face of violence, mischief, tyranny, oppression and terrorism); after that (O Glorious Beloved)—your Lord is Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful."
The Bee,16,111,"And (recall) that Day when every person will appear pleading for himself (in his defence), and every soul will be given full recompense for whatever it will have done, and they will not be wronged in the least."
The Bee,16,112,And Allah has described the example of a township which was (living) in peace and contentment. The means of sustenance came to (its residents) in abundance from all quarters. Then the (dwellers) of this town disregarded Allah’s blessings and showed ingratitude. Thereupon Allah clothed them in the torment of hunger and fear due to the activities that they used to carry out.
The Bee,16,113,"And indeed, there came to them from amongst themselves a Messenger but they denied him. So the torment seized them and they were certainly the wrongdoers."
The Bee,16,114,"So always eat of that clean and lawful sustenance which Allah has given you, and give thanks for the favour of Allah if it is indeed Him alone that you worship."
The Bee,16,115,"He has only forbidden you carrion, blood, the flesh of swine and (the animal) on which the name of other than Allah is invoked at the time of slaughter. But he who is faced with a survival condition (forced by necessity), neither defying (Allah’s injunctions seeking taste of lust), nor transgressing (the limit of necessity), then Allah is surely Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful."
The Bee,16,116,"And do not tell a lie which your tongues utter: ‘This is lawful and that is forbidden,’ thus fabricating a lie against Allah. Indeed, those who fabricate lies against Allah will (never) be delivered."
The Bee,16,117,"There is only a little profit, but the torment for them is painful (beyond proportion)."
The Bee,16,118,"And We made unlawful for the Jews the same things that We have mentioned to you before, and We did not wrong them, but they used to wrong their souls themselves."
The Bee,16,119,"Indeed your Lord, for those who committed wrongs out of ignorance, then turned to Him in repentance and amended (their) state, then surely after that your Lord is Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful."
The Bee,16,120,"Surely, Ibrahim (Abraham) was an Umma ([Community] in himself), exclusively obedient to Allah, turning away from all falsehood (ever inclined and given to Him alone) and was not of those who associate partners with Allah,"
The Bee,16,121,Grateful to (Allah) for His blessings. Allah chose him (and exalted him to a high office in His presence) and guided him to the straight path.
The Bee,16,122,"And We bestowed upon him good in this world, and he will surely be of the upright in the Hereafter (as well)."
The Bee,16,123,"Then, (O Glorious Beloved,) We sent down Revelation to you: ‘Follow the Din (Religion) of Ibrahim (Abraham), who was at variance with every falsehood, and was not of those who associate partners with Allah.’"
The Bee,16,124,"Saturday (the Sabbath) was ordained only for those who differed about it, and indeed your Lord will judge amongst them on the Day of Resurrection (in the matters) in which they used to differ."
The Bee,16,125,"(O Glorious Messenger!) Invite towards the path of your Lord with wisdom and refined exhortation and (also) argue with them in a most decent manner. Surely, your Lord knows well the one who strayed away from His path, and He also knows well the rightly guided."
The Bee,16,126,"And if you want to punish, then punish only (as severely) as you were afflicted, but if you remain patient, then certainly that is better for those who keep patience."
The Bee,16,127,"And, (O Glorious Beloved,) be patient and your patience is by Allah alone. And you should not grieve over their (defiance), nor distress (your gracious and benevolent heart) on account of their deceptive plots."
The Bee,16,128,"Surely, Allah blesses them who live with Godwariness and who (also) live with spiritual excellence with His (special) companionship."
The Children of Israel,17,1,"Holy (i.e., free of any imperfection, weakness and insufficiency) is He Who took His (most beloved and intimate) Servant in a small portion of a night from the Sacred Mosque to the al-Aqsa Mosque, whose surroundings We have blessed, in order that We might show him (the Perfect Servant) Our signs. Surely, He is the One Who is All-Hearing, All-Seeing."
The Children of Israel,17,2,And We gave Musa (Moses) the Book (the Torah) and made it guidance for the Children of Israel (and enjoined them:) ‘Do not take anyone other than Me as Guardian.’
The Children of Israel,17,3,"(O) children of those whom We carried (in the Ark) with Nuh (Noah)! Indeed, Nuh (Noah) was a highly grateful servant."
The Children of Israel,17,4,And We categorically conveyed to the Children of Israel in the Book: ‘You shall make mischief twice in the land and employ a violent defiance (against obedience to Allah).’
The Children of Israel,17,5,"So when the promised first time of the two came to pass, We brought upon you those of Our servants who were great warriors. Then, in (your) search, they penetrated up to your dwellings. And (this) promise was sure to be fulfilled."
The Children of Israel,17,6,Then We turned the victory over them to your favour and helped you with (affluence in) wealth and children and increased your numerical strength (as well).
The Children of Israel,17,7,"If you do good, you do it (only) for your own benefit, but if you do evil, you will sin against your own souls. Then, when the hour of the second promise came (We sent against you other tyrants) so that (lashing and whipping) they should deform your faces and enter the al-Aqsa Mosque, (the same way) as (the invaders) had entered it the first time, and so that they completely destroy whatever (place) they overpower."
The Children of Israel,17,8,"It may well be that (after this) your Lord will have mercy on you, but if you revert to the same (rebellious and defiant behaviour), then We too will get back to the same (tormenting once again). And We have made Hell a prison for the disbelievers."
The Children of Israel,17,9,"Indeed, this Qur’an leads to that (destination) which is most right, and gives this good news to those believers who do righteous works, that for them is a mighty reward,"
The Children of Israel,17,10,"And that those who do not believe in the Hereafter, We have prepared for them a painful punishment."
The Children of Israel,17,11,And (intolerant and anguished) man prays (sometimes) for evil as he prays for good (for himself). And man has happened to be very impulsive indeed.
The Children of Israel,17,12,"And We have made the night and the day two signs (of Our might). Then We made the Sign of the night dark and We made the sign of the day bright so that you might look for your Lord’s bounty (provision) and that you might work out the number of years and do reckoning, and We have made everything clear in detail."
The Children of Israel,17,13,"And We have slung every man’s record of deeds around his neck, and on the Day of Resurrection We shall bring forth (this) record, which he will find spread out (before him)."
The Children of Israel,17,14,"(It will be said to him:) ‘Read your book (of deeds). Today, you yourself are enough for examining your own account.’"
The Children of Israel,17,15,"Whoever adopts the path of guidance follows it to his own benefit, and whoever goes astray, then the evil consequences of his error also fall back on him alone. And no bearer of burden will bear the burden (of the sins) of any other. And We do not torment (any people) at all until We send a Messenger (to them)."
The Children of Israel,17,16,"And when We resolve to destroy a town, We send (some) command to the rich and the affluent amongst them (so that the common man and the poor may make amends) but they act disobediently in (the town). Thus Our decree (of torment) becomes due against it. Then We totally demolish that town."
The Children of Israel,17,17,"And how many a community have We destroyed after Nuh (Noah)! And your Lord is Sufficient. (He) is Well Aware of the sins of His servants, All-Seeing."
The Children of Israel,17,18,"Whoever longs for (quick recompense for his labour in the form of) worldly riches alone, We readily grant whatever We like to whoever We please, here in this world. Thereafter, We have set up Hell for him which he will enter hearing condemnation and contempt, rejected (from the mercy of his Lord)."
The Children of Israel,17,19,"And whoever longs for the Hereafter and toils for it befittingly and he is a believer (as well), it is they whose struggle will earn recognition."
The Children of Israel,17,20,"We extend help to all: those (ambitious of this world) as well as those (aspiring to the Hereafter. O Glorious Beloved, all this) is of your Lord’s bestowal. And the bestowal of your Lord is not forbidden and restricted (to anyone)."
The Children of Israel,17,21,"See how We have exalted some of them above the others! And surely, the Hereafter (as compared to this world) is far greater in degrees and in terms of superiority (as well)."
The Children of Israel,17,22,(O listener!) Do not set up another god along with Allah (lest) you should sit back condemned (and) forsaken.
The Children of Israel,17,23,"And your Lord has commanded you not to worship anyone other than Allah, and treat parents with benevolence. If either or both of them attain old age in your presence, then do not say even ‘Ugh!’ to them, nor reproach them. And always speak to both of them submissively, observing polite manners."
The Children of Israel,17,24,"And always lower your wings of submissiveness and humility out of soft-heartedness for both of them, and keep supplicating (Allah): ‘O my Lord, have mercy on both of them as they brought me up in (my) childhood (with mercy and clemency).’"
The Children of Israel,17,25,"Your Lord is Well Aware of the (matters and intentions) that are in your hearts. If you acquire righteous conduct, then surely He (Allah) is Most Forgiving to those who turn (towards Him)."
The Children of Israel,17,26,"And give to the kindred their rightful due, and also (give) to the needy and the wayfarer, and do not exhaust (your wealth) by expending wastefully."
The Children of Israel,17,27,"Surely, the spendthrifts are the brothers of Satan, and Satan is most ungrateful to his Lord."
The Children of Israel,17,28,"And if, in waiting for your Lord’s mercy (i.e., prosperity), which you look forward to, you seek to avoid these (deserving ones due to scarcity of means), then say to them kind words."
The Children of Israel,17,29,"And neither keep your hand tied to your neck (giving nothing to anyone), nor stretch it wide open (giving away all) lest you should sit back, blamed (and) consumed."
The Children of Israel,17,30,"Truly, your Lord opens up sustenance for whom He pleases and folds up (for whom He wills). Verily, He is All-Knowing of His servants’ (works and affairs), All-Seeing."
The Children of Israel,17,31,"And do not kill your children due to fear of poverty. We alone provide for them and for you (as well). Indeed, killing them is a major sin."
The Children of Israel,17,32,"And do not even go near unlawful sex (adultery). Verily, it is an act of lewdness and is the most evil way."
The Children of Israel,17,33,"And do not kill any soul whose (killing) Allah has declared unlawful unless (killing him) is just (according to the law and decree of the court). But whoever is killed unjustly, We have indeed given his heir the right (of retribution according to the legal procedure), but he too must not exceed the limits in (retributive) killing. He is indeed helped (by Allah. The responsibility of his legal help and support will be on the government.)"
The Children of Israel,17,34,"And (also) do not go near the orphan’s property, but in a way that is beneficial (to the orphan), until he reaches his maturity. And always fulfil the promise. No doubt, the promise will be questioned about."
The Children of Israel,17,35,"And measure in full whenever you measure out (anything), and (when you weigh anything) weigh with a straight balance. This (honesty) is better, and much better with regard to its consequence (as well)."
The Children of Israel,17,36,"And, (O man,) do not follow that of which you have no (authentic) knowledge. Indeed the ear, the eye and the heart—each of them will be questioned."
The Children of Israel,17,37,"And do not walk arrogantly on the earth. Certainly, you cannot cleave the earth (with the force of your arrogance), nor can you reach the mountains in height. (You will remain what you are.)"
The Children of Israel,17,38,The evil of all these (mentioned) acts is most despicable to your Lord.
The Children of Israel,17,39,"This is of those wisdom-loaded values which your Lord has revealed to you and, (O man,) do not set up another god with Allah, (lest) you should be cast into Hell, cursed (and) rejected (from Allah’s mercy)."
The Children of Israel,17,40,"(O idolaters! Think for yourselves!) Has your Lord picked you for sons and taken (for Himself) angels as daughters? Indeed, you utter a most awful saying (in the framework of your own fabricated ideas)."
The Children of Israel,17,41,"And surely, We have explained (facts and admonitions) in this Qur’an repeatedly and alternating styles so that people may take direction and guidance, but (the disbelievers’ state of mind is such that) this only increases their hatred."
The Children of Israel,17,42,"Say: ‘Had there been some other gods with Him, as they (the idolaters and the disbelievers) say, then they would certainly have (jointly) found some passage to reach the Lord of the Throne (to interfere in His command and control system).’"
The Children of Israel,17,43,"Holy is He and Most Exalted and Most High, far above all that they keep saying!"
The Children of Israel,17,44,"The seven heavens and the earth and all that exists in them persistently extol the Glory of Allah, and there is not a single object (in the entire universe) but glorifies Him with His Praise. Yet you cannot appreciate their (state of) glorification. He is surely Most Forbearing, Most Forgiving."
The Children of Israel,17,45,"And when you recite the Qur’an, (then) We place an imperceptible veil between you and those who do not believe in the Hereafter."
The Children of Israel,17,46,"And We (also) put covers over their hearts so that they may (not) get to its meaning, and plug their ears with a sensation of heaviness (so that they may not listen to it). And when you mention your Lord alone in the Qur’an (and the names of their idols are not mentioned) then, in extreme dislike, they turn their backs and flee away."
The Children of Israel,17,47,"We know best the motive with which they listen to with active attention when they give you ears and when they whisper and when these wrongdoers say (to the Muslims): ‘You are following only a person that is bewitched (i.e., a spell has been cast on him. And We see and hear all this).’"
The Children of Israel,17,48,(O Beloved!) See what similes (these people) find for you! So they have gone astray. Now they are unable to find a way to the right path.
The Children of Israel,17,49,"And they say: ‘When we shall become (decomposed) bones and dust particles (after dying), shall we be raised up alive anew?’"
The Children of Israel,17,50,"Say: ‘Be you stones or iron,"
The Children of Israel,17,51,"Or any other created matter which you deem even harder (than these things, and which is not susceptible to becoming a living thing).’ Then (in this condition) they will say: ‘Who will bring us back to life?’ Say: ‘He Who created you the first time.’ They will then shake their heads at you (by way of wonder and ridicule) and will say: ‘When will it happen?’ Say: ‘It is expected to occur soon.’"
The Children of Israel,17,52,"The Day when He will call you, you will respond praising Him, deeming that you tarried (in the world) for only a short while."
The Children of Israel,17,53,"And tell My servants that they should say things that are most balanced. Surely, Satan causes contention amongst people. Indeed, Satan is man’s declared enemy."
The Children of Israel,17,54,"Your Lord is Well Aware of your state of affairs. If He wills, He may have mercy on you, or if He likes, He may torment you. And We have not sent you as a guardian over them (to care for all their matters)."
The Children of Israel,17,55,"And your Lord knows them best who (dwell) in the heavens and the earth. And surely, We exalted some Messengers above the others and bestowed the Zabur (Psalms) upon Dawud (David)."
The Children of Israel,17,56,"Say: ‘Call all those that you consider (gods) apart from Allah. They do not have the power to remove distress from you, nor (have they the capability) to shift (it to others).’"
The Children of Israel,17,57,"Those that they worship (i.e., they prepare sculptures and images of angels, jinn, the Prophet ‘Isa [Jesus], ‘Uzayr [Ezra] and others and worship them) look for mediation to their Lord (themselves) as to who amongst them is most intimate (in the presence of Allah). And they (themselves) hope for His mercy and fear His torment. (Now say yourselves how they can be gods. They are prostrating themselves before the True God.) Indeed, the torment of your Lord is a thing to fear."
The Children of Israel,17,58,"And there is not a community (comprising disbelievers and the denying rebels), but We shall destroy it before the Day of Resurrection or afflict it with most severe torment. This (decree) is written in the Book (the Protected Tablet [al-Lawh al-Mahfuz])."
The Children of Israel,17,59,"And (nothing) has prevented Us from sending down the signs (on their demand even now) except that the bygone people denied the same (signs. Thereupon, they were immediately seized by destruction and were not granted any respite. O Beloved, We do not want to repeat that with your people after We have raised you as Our Messenger.) And We gave the people of Thamud an open Sign (of) a she-camel (of Salih) but they did her wrong. And We do not send signs but to rouse fear (for the last time before the torment arrives. Then, when that sign is rejected, the devastating torment is sent forthwith)."
The Children of Israel,17,60,"And (recall) when We said to you: ‘Indeed, your Lord has encompassed (all) mankind (within His knowledge and might). And We have made the vision (on the Night of Ascension) that We showed you but a trial for the people; (the believers believed in it, whilst those having superficial vision were confused;) and also that tree (of Zaqqum) which has been cursed in the Qur’an. And We warn them, but this (warning too) does not add anything to them except greater disobedience and rebelliousness.’"
The Children of Israel,17,61,And (call to mind the time) when We said to the angels: ‘Fall down in prostration before Adam.’ Then all prostrated themselves except Iblis. He said: ‘Shall I prostrate myself before him whom You have created of clay?’
The Children of Israel,17,62,"(And Satan also said:) ‘Tell me, is it he You have exalted over me? (What is its reason after all?) If You grant me respite till the Day of Resurrection, I shall root out his children except a few of them (by bringing them under my control).’"
The Children of Israel,17,63,"Allah said: ‘Go (respite is granted to you). So whoever of them follows you, Hell indeed is the only befitting punishment for you all."
The Children of Israel,17,64,"And whoever you can influence, destabilize (them) with your voice and invade them with (all the forces at your disposal) mounted and infantry troops and become a partner with them in their wealth and children and make them (false) promises. And Satan does not make them (any) promises but fraud and deceit."
The Children of Israel,17,65,"Assuredly, you will not be able to overpower those who are My servants, and your Lord is Sufficient to protect and help these (friends of Allah).’"
The Children of Israel,17,66,"Your Lord is He Who makes (the ships and) vessels sail in the sea (and rivers) for you so that you may look for His bounty (i.e., sustenance through internal and external trade). Indeed, He is Ever-Merciful towards you."
The Children of Israel,17,67,"And when some adversity afflicts you in the sea, then (all) those (idols) disappear (from your minds) you keep worshipping apart from Him (Allah Whom you remember at that time). Then, when He rescues you and takes you safe ashore, (you once again) start turning away (from Him). And man has happened to be extremely thankless!"
The Children of Israel,17,68,Do you feel free of this fear that He may sink you (into the land) right at the shore or may send you stone storm? Then you will not find any helper for yourselves.
The Children of Israel,17,69,Or have you become fearless that He may take you back once more (into the sea) and let loose upon you the ship-wrecking tempest and drown you (into the sea) because of your disbelief that you used to practise. Then you will not find for yourselves anyone to impeach Us (on this drowning).
The Children of Israel,17,70,"And We have indeed honoured the children of Adam and provided them with (means of transport) over the land and in the sea (i.e., in the cities, deserts, rivers and oceans) and bestowed upon them sustenance out of clean and pure things. And We have exalted them above most of Our creation by conferring on them superiority."
The Children of Israel,17,71,"(Call to mind) the Day when We shall call every section of people along with their leaders. So whoever will be given the record of his deeds in his right hand, so they will read their records (rejoicing) and they will not be wronged a bit."
The Children of Israel,17,72,"And whoever remains blind (to the truth) in this (world) will be blind in the Hereafter as well, distracted from the path (of deliverance)."
The Children of Israel,17,73,"And that is what the disbelievers were up to, that they might tempt you away from that (commandment) which We have revealed to you, so that you ascribe to Us some other (things) apart from this (Revelation), and then make you their friend."
The Children of Israel,17,74,"And had We not (already) made you firm-footed (through holiness and impeccability of Prophethood), even then you (owing to your holy and sanctified self and natural potential) would have but trivially gone near to inclining towards them. (You would not have even then bent much towards them and they would have failed. But Allah has protected you from even nearing such a probability through the holiness of Prophethood.)"
The Children of Israel,17,75,"(But, if supposedly you inclined, then) We would make you taste double of the torment in the worldly life and double of the torment in death. You would not then find (even) for yourself any helper against Us."
The Children of Israel,17,76,And the disbelievers also sought to shake you off the land (of Mecca) so that they might banish you from here. (But had that supposedly happened) then they (themselves) would also not have stayed there but for a little while.
The Children of Israel,17,77,This (has been) the practice (of Allah) with all those Messengers We sent before you and you will not find any change in Our way.
The Children of Israel,17,78,"Establish the Prayers (Zuhr [Midday], ‘Asr [Afternoon], Maghrib [Sunset] and ‘Isha’ [Night]) from the declining of the sun till the deep darkness of the night. And also (make obligatory) the recitation of Fajr Prayer, for the Qur’an in Fajr (Dawn) Prayer is attended (by the angels and a state of divine consciousness also permeates)."
The Children of Israel,17,79,"And in some part of the night (as well, rising from sleep,) offer the Tahajjud Prayer (with the Qur’an). This is added especially for you. Your Lord will certainly raise you to a station of praise and glory (i.e., the glorious station of intercession where all the former and later generations will turn towards you and glorify you)."
The Children of Israel,17,80,"And keep praying (to your Lord): ‘O my Lord, make me enter (wherever You are to make me enter) with the truth (pleasure), and bring me out (from wherever You are to bring me out) with the truth (pleasure). And bestow upon me from Your presence the dominance that assists and the power that supports.’"
The Children of Israel,17,81,"And say: ‘The truth has come and falsehood has fled. Surely, falsehood has to perish.’"
The Children of Israel,17,82,And We are sending down in the Qur’an what is healing and mercy for the believers. And it only increases the wrongdoers in loss.
The Children of Israel,17,83,"And when We bestow upon man (some) blessing, he turns away (from gratitude) and escapes, but when some distress comes upon him, he despairs (i.e., he is neither grateful nor patient)."
The Children of Israel,17,84,"Say: ‘Everyone acts according to his own (respective) style and nature, and your Lord knows full well who is best guided to the straight path."
The Children of Israel,17,85,"And they (the disbelievers) ask you about the spirit. Say: ‘The spirit is from my Lord’s command, and you have been given but a very little knowledge.’"
The Children of Israel,17,86,"And if We so will, We can erase this (Book) which We have revealed to you, (from people’s minds and from the written copies,) and you will not then find anyone who may plead your case before Us for the communication of this (Revelation),"
The Children of Israel,17,87,But that by your Lord’s mercy (We have kept it intact. This) is indeed His mighty favour to you (and through you to your Umma [Community]).
The Children of Israel,17,88,"Say: ‘Should all men and jinn join in the attempt to produce (some other book) the like of this Qur’an, (even) then they will not be able to produce the like thereof, though they may become supporters to one another.’"
The Children of Israel,17,89,"And surely, We have repeatedly explained for people every sort of example in this Qur’an (in diverse ways), but most people have not accepted (it. This is nothing) but sheer ingratitude."
The Children of Israel,17,90,"And they (the disbelievers of Mecca) say: ‘We shall never believe in you until you cause some water spring to gush out of the earth,"
The Children of Israel,17,91,"Or you have some garden of date-palms and grapes and you may cause streams to flow profusely therein,"
The Children of Israel,17,92,"Or, as you have an idea, cause some pieces of the sky to fall upon us (just now) or bring Allah and the angels before us,"
The Children of Israel,17,93,"Or you have a house of gold (wherein you live luxuriously) or you ascend up to heaven, but even then we will not believe in your ascension (to the heaven) until you bring down to us (from there) a Book which we may read (ourselves).’ Say: ‘Holy is my Lord (far above these vagaries). I am only a human being (and a Messenger) sent by Allah.’"
The Children of Israel,17,94,"And nothing prevented (these) people from believing, whilst there had come to them guidance (as well), except that they said: ‘Has Allah sent (a) man as Messenger?’"
The Children of Israel,17,95,"Say: ‘Had there been angels (instead of human beings) walking about, residing in the earth, then We (too) would have certainly sent down from heaven some angel as a Messenger.’"
The Children of Israel,17,96,"Say: ‘Sufficient is Allah for a witness between me and you. Surely, He is Well Aware of His servants, All-Seeing."
The Children of Israel,17,97,"And he whom Allah guides, then he is the rightly guided. But he whom He holds astray, you will not find for them any helper except Him. And We shall raise them on the Day of Resurrection prone, blind, dumb and deaf. Hell is their abode. Every time it abates, We shall flare it more ablaze (to torment them).’"
The Children of Israel,17,98,"That is their punishment because they denied Our Revelations. And they kept saying: ‘Shall we be raised alive afresh after (we die), reduced to (decomposed) bones and dust particles?’"
The Children of Israel,17,99,"Have they not seen that Allah, Who has created the heavens and the earth, also has the power to create the like of these people (again)? And He has fixed a term for them wherein there is no (chance of) doubt. The wrongdoers have even then refused to believe but (this) is ingratitude."
The Children of Israel,17,100,"Say: ‘If you were the owners of the treasures of my Lord’s mercy, you would even then hold (your hands) back (from spending) for fear of (total) exhaustion. And man has turned out to be highly narrow-minded and miserly."
The Children of Israel,17,101,"And, indeed, We bestowed upon Musa (Moses) nine bright signs. And ask the Children of Israel, when (Musa [Moses]) came to them, Pharaoh said to him: ‘O Musa (Moses), in my opinion you are but a bewitched man (i.e., a spell has been cast upon you).’"
The Children of Israel,17,102,"Musa (Moses) replied: ‘(In your heart of hearts) you know that none has sent down these signs as a means of warning and insight except the Lord of the heavens and the earth and, O Pharaoh, in my opinion you are ruined (i.e., you are going to perish soon).’"
The Children of Israel,17,103,Then (Pharaoh) resolved to uproot and cast away (Musa [Moses] and his people) from the land of (Egypt). So We drowned him and all those who were with him.
The Children of Israel,17,104,"Then after this, We said to the Children of Israel: ‘Settle in this land. Then, when the promise of the Hereafter comes to pass, We shall take you all mustered together.’"
The Children of Israel,17,105,"And We have sent down this (Qur’an) with the truth, and it is with the truth alone that it has come down. And, (O Glorious Beloved,) We have sent you but as a Bearer of glad tidings and as a Warner."
The Children of Israel,17,106,And We sent down the Qur’an in segments so that you might recite it to the people distinctly with pauses. And We have revealed it in intervals gradually (in accordance with the circumstances and expediencies).
The Children of Israel,17,107,"Say: ‘Believe in it or not, indeed those who were given the knowledge (of the Book) before you, they fall down upon their faces in prostration when this (Qur’an) is recited to them.’"
The Children of Israel,17,108,"And they say: ‘Holy is our Lord. Surely, the promise of our Lord was bound to come true.’"
The Children of Israel,17,109,"And they fall down on their faces, sighing and wailing, and this (Qur’an) keeps increasing their fear and submissiveness ever more."
The Children of Israel,17,110,"Say: ‘Call on Allah or call on al-Rahman (the Most Compassionate), by whatever Name you invoke Him, (all) the Best Names are His. And recite (the Qur’an in) your Prayer neither too loud nor too low, but adopt a (middle) course in between the two.’"
The Children of Israel,17,111,"And say: ‘All praise belongs to Allah alone, Who has neither taken any son (for Himself), nor is there any partner in (His) kingdom and authority, nor has He any aide due to any handicap. (O Beloved,) keep extolling His Greatness and Glory with conviction and magnify Him with all His magnificence.’"
The Cave,18,1,"All praise belongs to Allah, Who revealed the (Glorious) Book to His (Most Beloved and Intimate) Servant, and left not in it any crookedness."
The Cave,18,2,"(He made it) straight and moderate so that he might warn (the disbelievers) of fierce torment (coming) from Allah, and give good news to the believers who do pious deeds that for them is excellent reward (Paradise),"
The Cave,18,3,"Wherein they will live forever,"
The Cave,18,4,And (moreover) create fear in those who say that Allah has taken a son (for Himself).
The Cave,18,5,"Neither have they any knowledge of it, nor had their fathers. How dreadful is (this) utterance that is coming out of their mouths! They speak nothing but (sheer) falsehood."
The Cave,18,6,(O Venerable Beloved!) Will you put your (dear) life at stake with the traumatic grief for them if they do not put faith in this Word (of Allah)?
The Cave,18,7,"And indeed, We have made whatever is on earth a means of its beauty (and adornment) so that We test (the inhabitants of the earth) as to who is better in deeds."
The Cave,18,8,"And, surely, We shall reduce it to a barren land (perishing all) that is on (the surface of the earth)."
The Cave,18,9,"Have you thought of it (how) wondrous a sign of the signs (of Our might) were the People of the Kahf and the Raqim (i.e., the People of Cave and the Cave Tablet or the Raqim valley)?"
The Cave,18,10,"(Call to mind the time) when a few youths took refuge in the cave. They said: ‘O our Lord, bestow upon us mercy from Your presence and provide (means of) guidance in our affair.’"
The Cave,18,11,So We patted their ears (putting them to slumber) for some countable years in that cave.
The Cave,18,12,Then We raised them up to see which of the two groups would most rightly calculate (the time) that they stayed (in the cave).
The Cave,18,13,"We (now) narrate to you their actual state of affairs. They were indeed (a few) young men who believed in their Lord, and We increased for them (the light of) guidance."
The Cave,18,14,"And We strengthened and stabilized their hearts (through Our communication and divine affinity). When they stood (before their king), they said: ‘Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth. We shall never worship any (false) god besides Him. (If we do that,) then we shall certainly say something profane."
The Cave,18,15,"These are the people of our community who have made many gods apart from Him. Why do they not bring any clear proof (in support of their godhood)? So, who is a greater wrongdoer than he who fabricates a lie against Allah?’"
The Cave,18,16,"And (those young men mutually discussed:) ‘When you have withdrawn yourselves from them, and those (false gods) which they worship other than Allah, take shelter in (this) cave. Your Lord will open up His mercy for you and will facilitate you in your affair.’"
The Cave,18,17,"And you see that the sun, when it rises, moves to the right from their cave, and inclines obliquely from them to the left when it sets, whilst they are (lying) in the open chamber of the cave. This (change of the sun’s course) is one of the (great) signs of Allah’s (might). He whom Allah guides is the one who is rightly guided, but the one whom He holds strayed, you will not find for him any wali (friend to help) and murshid (guide to show the path)."
The Cave,18,18,"And, (O listener,) if you (look) at them, you will deem them awake, whereas they are asleep. And We keep changing their sides to the right and to the left (after regular intervals), and their dog is sitting on (their) threshold sprawling both its forelegs. Had you glanced at them (secretly), you would have run away, turning your back on them, and your heart would have been filled with their terror."
The Cave,18,19,"And likewise, We raised them up so that they could probe amongst themselves. (So) the vocal one amongst them said: ‘How long have you stayed (here)?’ They said: ‘We have tarried (here) for a day or (even) a part of that.’ (Winding it up, they) said: ‘Your Lord knows best how long you have stayed (here). So send someone of you to the city with this coin of yours. He should then find which food is more lawful and clean and bring you some of that. He should remain slow and polite (in going, buying and coming back), not leaving any clue about you (even) to a single person."
The Cave,18,20,"Surely, if they overpower you (after becoming aware of you), they will stone you to death, or force you (through oppression) to return to their faith. And, (if it so happens,) then you will not prosper at all."
The Cave,18,21,"And in this way, We unveiled their (state) to those (who succeeded them some centuries later) so that they might know that Allah’s promise is true, and (also) that there is no doubt about the coming of the Last Hour. (When these people of the cave died) and the people of the town disputed concerning their matter, they said: ‘Raise a building over their (cave as a monument). Their Lord knows best their state of (saintly) affairs.’ Those (believers) who had the upper hand in their matter said: ‘We shall certainly build a mosque (at their door so that the believers may pray therein, and acquire special bounty by obtaining spiritual nearness to the people of the cave).’"
The Cave,18,22,"(Now) some will say: ‘(The people of the cave) were three and the fourth was their dog,’ and still some will say: ‘(They) were five and the sixth was their dog.’ These are the estimations made without seeing. And others will say: ‘(They) were seven and the eighth was their dog.’ Say: ‘My Lord is the One Who exactly knows their number and none knows their (exact number) except a few.’ So do not discuss about them with anyone except the details that have been revealed. Nor seek any information from any of them (about the People of the Cave)."
The Cave,18,23,And never say about anything: ‘I shall do this tomorrow.’
The Cave,18,24,"But that: ‘If Allah so wills (i.e., saying: In sha Allah).’ And remember your Lord when you forget and say: ‘I believe my Lord will show me the path of guidance which is (even) nearer than this one.’"
The Cave,18,25,And (the People of the Cave [Kahf]) stayed in their cave for three hundred years and they added another (nine) years (to that).
The Cave,18,26,"Say: ‘Allah is the One Who knows best for how long they remained (there).’ He alone knows (all) the secrets of the heavens and the earth. How well He sees and how well He hears! They have no protector besides Him, nor does He share His sovereignty with anyone."
The Cave,18,27,"And recite that (Revelation) which has been revealed to you from the Book of your Lord. There is none who can change His Word, nor will you find any place of refuge except in Him."
The Cave,18,28,"(O My servant!) Stay tenaciously in the companionship of those who remember their Lord morning and evening, ardently seeking His pleasure, (keen on the glimpse of His sight, and eagerly aspiring to glance at His radiant Countenance). Your (affectionate and caring) looks must not but focus them. Do you seek the charisma of the worldly life (shifting your attention away from these self-denying devotees)? And (also) do not follow him whose heart We have made neglectful of Our remembrance, and who follows but the urge of his (ill-commanding self) and his case has exceeded all bounds."
The Cave,18,29,"And say: ‘(This) truth is from your Lord. So whoever desires may believe and whoever desires may deny.’ Indeed, We have prepared for the wrongdoers the Fire (of Hell) whose walls will surround them. And if (due to thirst and distress) they cry, they will be helped with water like molten copper which will scald their faces. How dreadful a drink and how terrible a resting place!"
The Cave,18,30,"Indeed, those who believe and do pious deeds, We certainly do not waste the reward of the one who does pious deeds."
The Cave,18,31,"For them there are (everlasting) Gardens with streams flowing under their (palaces). They will be adorned with bracelets of gold in these Gardens, and they will wear green attires of fine brocade and heavy silk. And there they will recline upon raised and richly adorned thrones. What an excellent reward and how beautiful a resting place!"
The Cave,18,32,"And relate to them the example of two men, one of whom We provided with two gardens of grapevines, and We hedged both from all sides with date-palms, and We grew between them (rich green) cultivated fields."
The Cave,18,33,"Both these gardens yielded (abundant) fruits, and their (produce) did not fall short of the mark. And We (also) made one stream flow in the middle of (each of) the two."
The Cave,18,34,"And this man had (also besides this) abundant fruits (i.e., resources). Whilst exchanging views with his companion, he said to him: ‘I am far more affluent than you and (also) more honourable with regard to family and tribal strength.’"
The Cave,18,35,"And (taking him along) he entered his garden. Doing wrong to his soul (by way of arrogance), he said: ‘I do not (even) imagine that this garden will perish."
The Cave,18,36,"Nor do I entertain the idea that the Last Hour will take place. And if (supposedly) I am returned to my Lord, even then I shall certainly get a place to return better than these gardens.’"
The Cave,18,37,"His companion, whilst exchanging views with him, said to him: ‘Have you denied (the Lord) Who has created you (first) from clay, and then from a drop of vital fluid, and then accomplished you (physically) into a full-grown man?"
The Cave,18,38,"But (this is what) I say: Allah alone is my Lord, and I do not associate any partner with my Lord."
The Cave,18,39,"And why did you not say when you entered your garden: It happens exactly as Allah wills. No one owns any power but with the help of Allah (Ma sha Allah, la quwwata illa bi-llah)? If (today) you find me inferior to you in wealth and riches (then what!)"
The Cave,18,40,"It is not far from possible that my Lord may give me a garden better than yours, and send from heaven some torment upon this (garden) turning it into a barren, slippery piece of land."
The Cave,18,41,Or its water may sink so deep into the earth that it gets beyond your means to fetch.’
The Cave,18,42,"And (because of his arrogance) all his fruits were besieged (with destruction), and in the morning he was but wringing his hands with grief bewailing all that wealth, which he had invested (in raising this garden). And the garden had fallen down on its trellises, and he (the embodiment of despair and despondence) said: ‘Would that I had not attributed peers to Allah (and had not employed self-conceit)!’"
The Cave,18,43,"And there was (also) no party for him to come to his help against Allah, nor was he himself able to avenge (this destruction)."
The Cave,18,44,(Here it becomes evident) that all authority belongs to Allah alone (Who is) the truth. He is the best to reward and the best to end.
The Cave,18,45,"And explain to them the example of the worldly life (as well): it is like water that We pour from the sky. With this the vegetation of the earth grows thick, but then it becomes dry stubble which the winds blow about, and Allah has perfect control over everything."
The Cave,18,46,"Wealth and children are (mere) adornment of the worldly life, but the things that (actually) endure (are) the good deeds (which) are best in the sight of your Lord as for reward and (also) most valuable as regards hope."
The Cave,18,47,"And that will be the Day (of Resurrection) when We shall move the mountains (in the atmosphere, broken to dust particles,) and you will see the earth as a clear plain (void of plantation, stones, animals and vegetation). And We shall gather together the whole of mankind, and shall not leave out any of them."
The Cave,18,48,"And (all) mankind will be presented to your Lord standing in rows. (It will be said to them:) ‘Indeed, you have come to Us (Today the way) We created you for the first time. In fact, you thought that We would never appoint for you the Hour of Promise.’"
The Cave,18,49,"And the record of deeds will be placed (before everyone). So, you will see the evildoers terrified at the (sins, wrongs and offences) registered (in the record). And they will say: ‘Oh, woe to us! What is the matter with this record that it has left out neither any insignificant (wrong) nor any big (blunder)? It has rather taken into account (each and every act).’ And they will find (before them) whatever they used to do, and your Lord will not do injustice to anyone."
The Cave,18,50,"And (recall) when We said to the angels: ‘Prostrate yourselves before Adam (in veneration).’ So they all prostrated themselves except Iblis. He (Iblis) was of the jinn, and he walked out of the obedience to his Lord. Are you taking him and his offspring for friends leaving Me, whereas, in truth, they are your enemies? How evil a substitute the evildoers (have opted in My place)!"
The Cave,18,51,"I called them neither (for assistance or witness) on the creation of the heavens and the earth, nor (at the time of) their own creation. Nor was it My Glory to take the inciters of misguidance as (My) supporters."
The Cave,18,52,"And (remember) the Day (when) Allah will say: ‘Call those that you deemed to be My peers.’ So they will call them, but they will not give them any answer, and We shall place between them (a valley of Hell), the site of destruction."
The Cave,18,53,"And the evildoers will see the Fire of Hell, and realize that certainly they are about to fall into it. And they will not be able to find any means to escape from it."
The Cave,18,54,"And We have indeed put forth in the Qur’an repeatedly for mankind every kind of example (alternating the styles), but man is far ahead in contention than anything else."
The Cave,18,55,"And nothing prevented the people from embracing faith and imploring forgiveness from their Lord, whilst guidance had reached them, except (waiting for) the pattern of the ancients’ (destruction) occurring to them, or that the torment should come in front of them."
The Cave,18,56,"And We do not send Messengers but as Bearers of glad tidings (to the people) and as Warners. And the disbelievers dispute with (these Messengers) taking leverage of false arguments so as to eliminate the truth with (falsehood). And they scoff at My Revelations, and the (torment) of which they are warned."
The Cave,18,57,"And who is a greater wrongdoer than one who was reminded of the signs of Allah, but he turned away from them and forgot those (evil deeds) which his hands had sent forward? Verily, We have cast veils over their hearts so that they may (not) understand this truth, and have plugged their ears with heaviness (so that they may not hear this truth). And if you invite them towards guidance, never ever will they take guidance."
The Cave,18,58,"And your Lord is Most Forgiving, Full of Mercy. If He had to take them to task for their doings, He would certainly send the torment upon them quickly. And in truth, the Hour of Promise is (appointed) for them. (When that time comes,) they will not find any place of shelter except with Him."
The Cave,18,59,And these are the towns whose inhabitants We destroyed when they perpetrated oppression and injustice. And We had fixed a time for their destruction.
The Cave,18,60,"And (also call to mind the incident) when Musa (Moses) said to his (young companion and) disciple (Yusha‘ b. Nun [Joshua, the son of Nun]): ‘I will not step (back) until I arrive at the junction of the two seas, or I travel on infinitely.’"
The Cave,18,61,"So when both of them reached the junction of the two seas, they forgot their fish (there). So, that (fried fish came back to life, and) made its way into the sea like a tunnel and slipped off."
The Cave,18,62,"Then, when both of them had gone ahead, Musa (Moses) asked his disciple: ‘Bring us our meal. Surely, we have faced great hardship during this journey of ours.’"
The Cave,18,63,"(The disciple) said: ‘Did you see when we reposed beside the rock? I forgot the fish (there), and none but Satan made me forget to mention it to you. And that fish (after coming back to life) made its way into the sea in a strange way (and it disappeared).’"
The Cave,18,64,"Musa (Moses) said: ‘That is the place we were looking for.’ So both returned to (the same place), tracing the (same path), following their footsteps."
The Cave,18,65,"Then both found (there) one of Our (elite) servants (Khidr) upon whom We had bestowed from Our Presence (special) mercy and had taught him infused knowledge (i.e., the inspired knowledge of secrets and gnostics)."
The Cave,18,66,"Musa (Moses) said to him: ‘Can I stay with you under this (condition) that you will teach me (as well) some of that knowledge, which has been conferred on you for guidance?’"
The Cave,18,67,"He (Khidr) said: ‘No doubt, you will not be able to have patience being in my company."
The Cave,18,68,And how can you observe patience in (the matter of) which you will not have acquired (thorough) knowledge?’
The Cave,18,69,"Musa (Moses) said: ‘You will certainly find me patient, if Allah so pleases, and I will not violate any of your instructions.’"
The Cave,18,70,"(Khidr) said: ‘So if you are in my company, then do not question me about anything until I myself mention that to you.’"
The Cave,18,71,"So both of them set out till, when they embarked on a boat, (Khidr) bored a hole in it. Musa (Moses) said: ‘Have you bored (a hole in) it to drown the people aboard? Surely, you have done something strange.’"
The Cave,18,72,(Khidr) said: ‘Did I not tell you that you would not be able to restrain yourself in my company?’
The Cave,18,73,"Musa (Moses) said: ‘Call me not to account for my omission, and put me not in any more difficulty in (this) affair of mine.’"
The Cave,18,74,"Then both of them proceeded till they met a boy. (Khidr) killed him. Musa (Moses) said: ‘Have you killed a harmless soul without any (retribution due) for anyone killed? Indeed, you have done a horrible thing!’"
The Cave,18,75,(Khidr) said: ‘Did I not tell you that you would never be able to keep patience in my company?’
The Cave,18,76,"Musa (Moses) said: ‘If I ask you about anything after this, then do not keep me with you. Indeed, in my opinion, you have reached the limit to excuse.’"
The Cave,18,77,"Then both set off, until they reached the people of a town; both asked its residents for food but they refused to entertain them. Then they found there a wall, which was about to fall. (Khidr) erected it. Musa (Moses) said: ‘If you desired, you could take wages for this (construction work).’"
The Cave,18,78,(Khidr) said: ‘This is the parting (time) between me and you. Now I shall impart to you the truth of the matters about which you have not been able to keep patience.
The Cave,18,79,"As for the boat, that belonged to some poor people who used to toil for wages on the river. So I decided to make it defective (because) a (cruel) king was (standing) ahead of them, snatching every (undamaged) boat by force (from the owners without any compensation)."
The Cave,18,80,"And as for the boy, his parents were blessed with faith. So we feared that (if he lived on, he would become a disbeliever, and on attaining to maturity) he would afflict both of them with disobedience and disbelief."
The Cave,18,81,So we intended that their Lord might bless them with (such) a substitute as would be better than this (boy) in purity and nearer (to his parents as well) in clemency and kindness.
The Cave,18,82,"And as for the wall, that belonged to two orphan boys (residing) in the town. And a treasure was (buried) beneath it for both of them. And their father was (a) pious (man). So your Lord willed that both of them should reach their age of maturity, and dig out their treasure (themselves) by mercy from your Lord. And I did not do (whatever I did) of my own accord. This is the truth (of the matters) about which you could not hold yourself.’"
The Cave,18,83,"And, (O Most Esteemed Beloved,) they ask you about Dhu al-Qarnayn. Say: ‘I recite to you an account of him now.’"
The Cave,18,84,(In ancient times) We did grant him power in the land and blessed (his rule) with all the means and resources.
The Cave,18,85,"Then he took another way,"
The Cave,18,86,"Until he reached the boundary of (a locality towards) the west where he perceived the setting of the sun as if going down into a spring of (muddy black) hot water, and he found a people (living) there. We said: ‘O Dhu al-Qarnayn, (it is up to you) whether you punish them or treat them nicely.’"
The Cave,18,87,"Dhu al-Qarnayn said: ‘Whoever perpetrates injustice (by way of disbelief and mischief-mongering), we will certainly punish him. He will then be brought back to his Lord. And then He will award him most grievous punishment."
The Cave,18,88,"And whoever believes and does pious acts will have better reward, and We shall (also) say for him in Our commands what is lenient.’"
The Cave,18,89,"Then (after consolidating his conquests in the west) he set forth on (another) course,"
The Cave,18,90,"Until he reached the boundary (of a locality in the direction) of the sunrise. There he perceived (the rising of) the sun (as if) it were rising on the people (living in that piece of land) for whom We had provided no cover (for protection) against the sun (i.e., they lived in the caves, without clothes and houses)."
The Cave,18,91,It occurred the same way. And We have encompassed with Our knowledge whatever he had.
The Cave,18,92,"(Having accomplished his conquests in the east,) he then followed (still another) route,"
The Cave,18,93,Until he reached (a place) between two mountains. He found a people dwelling behind these mountains. They were unable to understand (anyone’s) speech.
The Cave,18,94,They said: ‘O Dhu al-Qarnayn! Gog and Magog have spread disorder in the land. Should we fix some money (as a tribute) for you on this (condition) that you raise a high wall between us and them?’
The Cave,18,95,"(Dhu al-Qarnayn) said: ‘The power my Lord has given me in this connection is better. Assist me with your vigour (diligence and labour), and I shall erect a fortified wall between you and them."
The Cave,18,96,"Bring me large blocks of iron.’ So, when he levelled (that iron wall) between the two (mountain) tops, he said: ‘(Now) blow (it after putting it on fire).’ So, when he turned that (iron) into a fire (by successive blowing), he said: ‘(Now) bring me molten copper to pour on it.’"
The Cave,18,97,"Then they (Gog and Magog) did not have the ability to scale it, nor could they acquire the capability to bore through it."
The Cave,18,98,"(Dhu al-Qarnayn) said: ‘This is mercy from my Lord. But when my Lord’s promise (of the Last Hour) comes (near), He will (demolish this wall and) level it with the ground (i.e., it will be reduced to dust particles). And the promise of my Lord is bound to come true.’"
The Cave,18,99,"And at that time, We shall release (all the creation or Gog and Magog). They will run into each other (like surging waves). And the trumpet will be blown. Then We shall gather them all (in the Last Day Assembly)."
The Cave,18,100,"And on that Day, We shall present Hell before the disbelievers fully exposed,"
The Cave,18,101,Those whose eyes were veiled (by negligence) against My remembrance and they could not even listen (to My remembrance).
The Cave,18,102,"Do the disbelievers think that, instead of Me, they will take My servants as helpers? Surely, We have prepared Hell as hospitality for the disbelievers."
The Cave,18,103,Say: ‘Shall We alert you to those who are great losers in respect of deeds?
The Cave,18,104,"It is those whose entire struggle is wasted in worldly life, but they presume they are doing good works.’"
The Cave,18,105,"It is they who have denied the signs of their Lord and meeting Him (after death). So all their deeds are ruined, and We shall not give any weight or (even) any worth to them on the Day of Rising."
The Cave,18,106,This very Hell is their reward because they kept disbelieving and mocking My signs and My Messengers.
The Cave,18,107,"Surely, those who believe and do good deeds persistently shall have the Gardens of Paradise as their hospitality."
The Cave,18,108,They will always live there. They will never seek any change (of abode) from there.
The Cave,18,109,"Say: ‘If the ocean turns into ink for the Words of my Lord, that ocean will exhaust before the Words of my Lord come to an end, even if We bring another similar (ocean or ink) to refill.’"
The Cave,18,110,"Say: ‘I look like you only (by virtue of my visible creation) as a man. (Otherwise just think what congruity you have with me.) It is I to whom the Revelation is transmitted that your God is the One and only God. (And just see to it whether you have any such divine potential that the Word of Allah may come down to you.) So, whoever hopes to meet his Lord should do good deeds, and must not associate any partner in the worship of his Lord.’"
Mary,19,1,"Kaf, Ha, Ya, ‘Ayn, Sad. (Only Allah and the Messenger [blessings and peace be upon him] know the real meaning.)"
Mary,19,2,"This is an account of the mercy of your Lord (bestowed) upon His (chosen) servant Zakariyya (Zacharias),"
Mary,19,3,When he called upon his Lord in a low voice (charged with politeness and submissiveness).
Mary,19,4,"He submitted: ‘O my Lord, my bones have grown tender and (my) head has turned white like a flame due to old age and, O my Lord, I have never been unblessed when supplicating You."
Mary,19,5,"And I fear my (disbelieving) relatives (may ruin the blessing of Din [Religion]) after my (soul departs) and my wife (too) is barren. So bless me from Your presence with an heir (son),"
Mary,19,6,"(The one) who should be my heir (of divine blessing), and also the heir of (the chain of Prophethood from) the Children of Ya‘qub (Jacob). And, O my Lord, (also) make him a recipient of Your Pleasure.’"
Mary,19,7,"(Allah said:) ‘O Zakariyya (Zacharias), indeed We give you the good news of a son whose name shall be Yahya (John). We have not given this name to anyone before him.’"
Mary,19,8,"(Zakariyya [Zacharias]) submitted: ‘My Lord, how can there be a son to me whilst my wife is barren, and I have shrivelled (into extreme debility) on account of old age?’"
Mary,19,9,"(He) said: ‘(Don’t be amazed.) It will be the same way.’ Your Lord said: ‘It is easy for Me (to create a son). Certainly, I created you (too) before, whilst you were (just) nothing.’"
Mary,19,10,"(Zakariyya [Zacharias]) submitted: ‘My Lord, set a sign for me.’ He said: ‘Your sign is that, despite good health, you shall not be able to speak to the people for three nights (and days).’"
Mary,19,11,"Then (Zakariyya [Zacharias]) came out from his worshipping chamber to his people and conveyed to them (i.e., made them understand) by gestures to glorify (Allah) morning and evening."
Mary,19,12,"O Yahya (John)! Hold fast to (Our) Book (the Torah). And We granted him wisdom and vision (i.e., Prophethood) whilst yet a child,"
Mary,19,13,"And (blessed him) with sympathy and tenderness and purity and virtuousness from Our kind presence, and he was very Godfearing."
Mary,19,14,"(He was) greatly righteous (and dutiful) to his parents, and was neither disobedient nor arrogant (like common boys)."
Mary,19,15,"And peace be on Yahya (John) the day he was born, the day he dies, and the day he will be raised up alive!"
Mary,19,16,"And, (O My Esteemed Beloved,) recite the account of Maryam (Mary) in the Book (the Holy Qur’an) when she separated from her family (adopting seclusion for worship and) moved to the eastern house."
Mary,19,17,"So she adopted veiling from them (the family and the people so that the absolute divine beauty unveils Himself). Then We sent towards her Our Spirit (the angel, Gabriel), who appeared before her in complete form of a human being."
Mary,19,18,(Maryam [Mary]) said: ‘I seek refuge with the Most Gracious (Lord) from you if you fear (Allah).’
Mary,19,19,(Jibra’il [Gabriel]) said: ‘I am only a messenger from your Lord. (I have come) to bestow upon you a pure son.’
Mary,19,20,"(Maryam [Mary]) said: ‘How can there be a son to me, whereas no man has even touched me, nor am I unchaste?’"
Mary,19,21,"(Jibra’il [Gabriel]) said: ‘(Do not wonder.) It will be the same way. Your Lord says: This (work) is easy for Me, and (the objective is) that We may make him a sign for the people and mercy from Us. And it is a matter (already) decreed.’"
Mary,19,22,"So Maryam (Mary) conceived him and positioned herself at a remote site, aloof (from the people)."
Mary,19,23,Then the birth pangs drove her to the trunk of a palm-tree. She said (in anxiety): ‘Would that I had died before this and had become totally forgotten!’
Mary,19,24,"Then (Gabriel or ‘Isa [Jesus] himself) called out to her from beneath her: ‘Grieve not. Surely, your Lord has made a water spring flow under you (or has created and laid under you an exalted human being)."
Mary,19,25,And shake the trunk of the date-palm towards you. It will shed fresh ripe dates upon you.
Mary,19,26,"So eat and drink and cool (your) eyes (with the sight of your beautiful, lovely baby). Then if you see any man, say (to him by gestures): ‘I have vowed a fast (of silence) to the Most Gracious (Lord), so I shall just not talk to any human being today.’"
Mary,19,27,"Then, carrying (the baby in her lap), she came to her people. They said: ‘O Maryam (Mary), surely you have brought quite an amazing thing!"
Mary,19,28,"O sister of Harun (Aaron)! Neither was your father a bad man, nor was your mother an unchaste woman.’"
Mary,19,29,On this Maryam (Mary) pointed to (the baby). They said: ‘How can we talk to him who is (yet) an infant in the cradle?’
Mary,19,30,(The infant himself) spoke out: ‘I am indeed a servant of Allah. He has given me the Book and has raised me as a Prophet.
Mary,19,31,"And wherever I may reside, He has made me an embodiment of blessing. And He has enjoined upon me Prayer and Zakat (the Alms-due) as long as I am alive."
Mary,19,32,And (He has made me) treat my mother with excellence and has not made me disobedient and ill-fated.
Mary,19,33,"And peace be upon me on the day of my birth, the day of my demise and the day I shall be raised up alive!’"
Mary,19,34,"Such is ‘Isa, the son of Maryam (Jesus, the son of Mary. That is) the truth about which these people doubt."
Mary,19,35,"It is not Allah’s Glory that He should take (to Himself anyone as) a son. Holy and Glorified is He (above this)! When He decrees any matter, He only says to it: ‘Be,’ and it becomes."
Mary,19,36,"And surely, Allah is my Lord and your Lord (too). So always worship Him alone. This is the straight path."
Mary,19,37,Then their sects began to differ amongst themselves. So the disbelievers are doomed due to the presence on the Mighty Day (of Resurrection).
Mary,19,38,"How (curiously) will they hear (with their ears wide open), and how (bewilderedly) will they see (with their eyes stunned) on the Day when they will appear before Us! But Today the wrongdoers are but (sunk) into manifest error."
Mary,19,39,"And warn them of the Day of Regret (and Shame) when (every) matter shall be decided, but they are rapt in (a state of) negligence and simply do not believe."
Mary,19,40,"Surely, We alone are the Inheritor of the earth and (also) of those who dwell on it, and (they all) shall be brought back to Us."
Mary,19,41,"And recite the account of Ibrahim (Abraham) in the Book (the Holy Qur’an). Surely, he was a Prophet blessed with truthfulness."
Mary,19,42,"When he said to his father (i.e., his uncle Azar who brought him up after his father Tarakh died): ‘O my father, why do you worship these (idols) which cannot hear or see, nor can they remove any (troublesome) thing from you?"
Mary,19,43,O father! No doubt there has come to me knowledge (from the divine presence of Allah) which has not come to you. Follow me; I shall show you the straight path.
Mary,19,44,"O father! Do not worship Satan. Surely, Satan is a great rebel against the Most Kind (Lord)."
Mary,19,45,"O father! Indeed, I fear that a torment from the Most Kind (Lord) may seize you and you become a companion of Satan.’"
Mary,19,46,"(Azar) said: ‘Ibrahim (Abraham), have you turned away from my gods? If you do not practically desist (from this opposition), I shall certainly stone you to death. And keep away from me for a long while.’"
Mary,19,47,"Ibrahim (Abraham) said: ‘(All right,) peace be on you. I shall beg forgiveness for you from my Lord (even) now. He is indeed very kind to me. (He may bestow guidance upon you.)"
Mary,19,48,"And I turn away from you (all), and these (idols) which you worship besides Allah. And I worship my Lord (with absolute concentration). I hope that, owing to the worship of my Lord, I shall not be deprived (of His bounty).’"
Mary,19,49,"So when Ibrahim (Abraham, giving up all social links,) completely separated from the people and those (idols) that they worshipped apart from Allah, We blessed him with Ishaq (Isaac) and Ya‘qub (Jacob, son and grandson,) and We made each of them a Prophet."
Mary,19,50,"And We awarded (all of) them Our (special) mercy, and put their praise and admiration on high rhetoric (amongst the believers of every religion)."
Mary,19,51,"And recite the account of Musa (Moses) in (this Holy) Book. Surely, (getting rid of the grip of self,) he had become exalted and was a Messenger and Prophet."
Mary,19,52,"And We called him out from the right of (Mount) Tur, and blessed him with Our (special) nearness for intimate discourse."
Mary,19,53,"And out of Our mercy We granted him his brother Harun (Aaron), making him a Prophet (to assist him in his task)."
Mary,19,54,"And recite the account of Isma‘il (Ishmael) in (this) Book. Surely, he was true to (his) promise and was a Messenger (and) a Prophet."
Mary,19,55,"And he used to enjoin on his family Prayer and Zakat (the Alms-due), and (held) the station of mardiyya in the presence of his Lord (i.e., his Lord was well-pleased with him)."
Mary,19,56,"And mention in the Book the account of Idris. Verily, he was a Prophet possessing the truth."
Mary,19,57,And We raised him to a lofty station.
Mary,19,58,"These are the people on whom Allah bestowed favour from amongst the Prophets of the seed of Adam, and of those (believers) whom We (saved from Deluge and) carried with Nuh (Noah) in the Ark, and of the posterity of Ibrahim (Abraham) and Isra’il (Israel i.e., Ya‘qub [Jacob]) and of those (chosen ones) whom We guided and exalted. When the Verses of the Most Kind (Lord) are recited to them, they fall down prostrating themselves in (profuse) tears."
Mary,19,59,"Then followed their pathetic successors who gave up Prayers and followed the lusts (of their ill-commanding selves). So they will soon face punishment in the Hereafter (in the Ghayi valley of Hell),"
Mary,19,60,Except the one who repents and believes and persists in righteous works; they will enter Paradise and will not be wronged in the least.
Mary,19,61,"(They will dwell) in such evergreen gardens which the Most Kind (Lord) has promised to His servants in the unseen. Certainly, His promise is about to come true."
Mary,19,62,"They will not hear in it any absurd talk but only greetings of peace (pouring in from every direction). And for them, their sustenance will be (available) in it morning and evening."
Mary,19,63,This is the Paradise which We shall award as inheritance to those of Our servants who are Godfearing.
Mary,19,64,"And, (O Jibra’il [Gabriel], say to My Beloved:) ‘We cannot descend (onto earth) without the command of your Lord. To Him belongs whatever is before us and whatever is behind us and whatever is in between. And your Lord is never forgetful (of you)."
Mary,19,65,(He) is the Lord of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between the two. So worship Him and remain steadfast in His worship. Do you know who is His namesake?’
Mary,19,66,And man says: ‘Shall I be soon brought forth alive when I die?’
Mary,19,67,Does man not remember that We had created him before this (also) whilst he was just nothing?
Mary,19,68,"So, by your Lord, We will certainly gather them and (all) satans together (on the Day of Judgment). We will then bring them (all) around Hell fallen down in kneeling position."
Mary,19,69,"Then We shall indeed pick out from every group the one who had been most disobedient to, and rebellious against, the Most Kind (Lord)."
Mary,19,70,And We know best those who are most deserving of being thrown into Hell.
Mary,19,71,"And there is none of you but will pass over Hell. This (promise,) which will certainly be fulfilled, is absolutely with your Lord."
Mary,19,72,"Then We shall deliver the Godfearing, and shall leave the wrongdoers in it (Hell) down on their knees."
Mary,19,73,"And when Our enlightening Verses are recited to them, the disbelievers say to the believers: ‘(See in the selfsame world) which of us two groups has better housing and a more influential social circle.’"
Mary,19,74,And how many a people have We destroyed before them who were better off (than these) in worldly assets and pomp and show!
Mary,19,75,"Say: ‘The Most Kind (Lord also) grants respite in age and luxury to the one who is lost in error until, when they see what they have been promised—the torment or the Day of Rising—then they will come to know him who is worse in respect of dwelling and (also) weaker in respect of troops.’"
Mary,19,76,"Allah adds to the guidance of those who are guided aright. And in the sight of your Lord, the lasting pious deeds are better in respect of reward and (also) more valuable in terms of end result."
Mary,19,77,"Have you seen such a person that rejected Our Signs and said: ‘I shall certainly be given wealth and children (the same way, even on the Day of Resurrection)’?"
Mary,19,78,"Is he aware of the unseen, or has he taken any promise from the Most Kind (Lord)?"
Mary,19,79,"No way! We shall keep writing down what he says, and shall keep increasing for him torment (upon torment)."
Mary,19,80,"And (after his death) We shall inherit from him what he proclaims, and he will come to Us all alone (without wealth and children)."
Mary,19,81,And they have taken (many other) gods apart from Allah so that they may be a source of honour for them.
Mary,19,82,By no means! Soon will these (false gods themselves) reject their worship and become their enemies.
Mary,19,83,Have you not seen that We have sent satans upon the disbelievers? They keep rousing them (against Islam) all the time.
Mary,19,84,So do not make haste against them (for torment). We Ourselves keep counting the days (for their impending catastrophe).
Mary,19,85,"On the Day, when We shall assemble the Godfearing, and take them (as guests of honour) to the presence of the Most Kind (Lord) on carriages;"
Mary,19,86,And We shall drive the sinners thirsty towards Hell;
Mary,19,87,"(On that Day,) people will not possess the authority to intercede, except those who have taken a promise (of intercession) from the Most Kind (Lord)."
Mary,19,88,And (the disbelievers) say: ‘The Most Kind (Lord) has taken (to Himself) a son.’
Mary,19,89,(O disbelievers!) You have indeed brought most horrible and unusual evil (on your tongues).
Mary,19,90,"The heavens may just burst at this (fabricated lie) and the earth split asunder and the mountains fall down to pieces,"
Mary,19,91,That they have attributed a son to the Most Kind (Lord).
Mary,19,92,And it is not befitting the Glory of the Most Kind (Lord) to take (someone as) a son.
Mary,19,93,"Whoever is (dwelling) in the heavens and the earth (whether an angel, a jinn or a human being) will appear just as a servant before the Most Kind (Lord)."
Mary,19,94,"(Allah) has surely encompassed them with His (knowledge) and has counted them thoroughly (i.e., numbering them one by one)."
Mary,19,95,And each one of them has to appear before His presence alone on the Day of Resurrection.
Mary,19,96,"Surely, those who believed and did pious deeds, the Most Kind (Lord) will create love for them in the hearts (of the people)."
Mary,19,97,"So We have indeed made this (Qur’an) easy in your own tongue so that, by means of it, you may communicate good news to the Godfearing and may warn thereby the contentious people."
Mary,19,98,And how many a community have We destroyed before them! Do you perceive even a trace or hear even the faintest fizzle of any of them?
Tâ Hâ,20,1,Ta-Ha. (Only Allah and the Messenger [blessings and peace be upon him] know the real meaning.)
Tâ Hâ,20,2,(O My Esteemed Beloved!) We have not revealed the Qur’an to you that you land in distress.
Tâ Hâ,20,3,But (it) is (revealed as) admonition for him who fears (his Lord).
Tâ Hâ,20,4,(This) has been revealed by (Allah) Who created the earth and the lofty heavens.
Tâ Hâ,20,5,"(He is) Most Kind (Lord) Who established (His sovereignty) on the Throne (of power and supreme authority over all the systems of the universe, befitting His Glory)."
Tâ Hâ,20,6,"(So) whatever is in the heavens (i.e., the upper divine and celestial spheres and spatial terrestrial spheres) and whatever is in the earth and whatever is in between (i.e., the atmospheric spheres) and whatever is beneath the soil to its bed, all are (functioning in compliance with) His (command and control system)."
Tâ Hâ,20,7,"And (there is no harm) if, in remembrance and Prayer, you raise (your voice). He knows the secrets (of hearts) and also the most hidden mysteries. (Then how He will not hear the loud supplications!)"
Tâ Hâ,20,8,"Allah is (His Self-Name) besides Whom there is no God (i.e., believe in Him alone and deny all other false gods). There are (also) many other Beautiful Names for Him (that speak of His most beautiful attributes)."
Tâ Hâ,20,9,And has the account of Musa (Moses) reached you?
Tâ Hâ,20,10,"When Musa (Moses) saw a fire (on his way back to Egypt from Madyan), he said to his family: ‘Stay here. I have seen a fire (or I have perceived a flash of love and cordiality in a fire). Perhaps I may bring a brand from it for you (also), or I find at that fire the guidance (which I am searching for).’"
Tâ Hâ,20,11,"So when he reached that (fire), a call was made: ‘O Musa (Moses)!"
Tâ Hâ,20,12,"Certainly, I am your Lord, so take off your shoes. Verily, you are in the sacred valley of Tuwa."
Tâ Hâ,20,13,"And I have chosen you (for My Messengership), so listen to what is being revealed to you with absolute attentiveness."
Tâ Hâ,20,14,"Verily, I am Allah. There is no God other than Me. So always worship Me, and establish Prayer for the sake of My remembrance."
Tâ Hâ,20,15,"Certainly, the Last Hour is about to come. I want to keep it secret so that every soul may be rewarded for that (deed) for which it is exerting."
Tâ Hâ,20,16,"So let not someone who (himself) does not believe in it and follows his own lust (of the lower self) prevent you from (focusing on) it, otherwise you (too) will perish."
Tâ Hâ,20,17,"And what is this in your right hand, O Musa (Moses)?’"
Tâ Hâ,20,18,"He submitted: ‘This is my staff. I lean on it, and beat down leaves with it for my goats, and in it there are also many other benefits for me.’"
Tâ Hâ,20,19,"(Allah) said: ‘O Musa (Moses), cast it down (on the ground).’"
Tâ Hâ,20,20,"So he cast it down (on the ground), and suddenly it became a serpent slithering (here and there)."
Tâ Hâ,20,21,Allah said: ‘Catch it and do not fear. We shall transform it to its former state just now.’
Tâ Hâ,20,22,And (it was commanded:) ‘Press your hand in your armpit. It will come out radiant white without any disease. (This) is another sign.
Tâ Hâ,20,23,(We are doing) this so that We show you greater signs of Our (might).
Tâ Hâ,20,24,Go to Pharaoh. He has exceeded limits (in defiance and rebellion).’
Tâ Hâ,20,25,"Musa (Moses) prayed: ‘O my Lord, expand my breast for me."
Tâ Hâ,20,26,And make my task (as a Messenger) easy for me.
Tâ Hâ,20,27,"And untie the knot from my tongue,"
Tâ Hâ,20,28,That people may understand (easily) what I say.
Tâ Hâ,20,29,And appoint for me a minister from my family.
Tâ Hâ,20,30,"(That) is Harun (Aaron), my brother."
Tâ Hâ,20,31,Provide me strength and backup with him.
Tâ Hâ,20,32,"And make him share my task (of Messengership),"
Tâ Hâ,20,33,"So that we (both) may amply glorify You,"
Tâ Hâ,20,34,And amply remember You.
Tâ Hâ,20,35,"Surely, You see us well (in the perspective of total scenario).’"
Tâ Hâ,20,36,"(Allah) said: ‘O Musa (Moses), you are granted your every prayer."
Tâ Hâ,20,37,"And surely, We graciously favoured you once (earlier as well),"
Tâ Hâ,20,38,When We revealed to your mother’s heart what was revealed—
Tâ Hâ,20,39,"To put him (Musa [Moses]) into a box and place that (box) into the river. Then the river will drift it to the bank. My enemy and his enemy will pick him up. And I cast on you from My presence a reflection of My (exceptional) love (i.e., We have made you so lovely and charismatic that whoever glances at you will be fascinated). And (this was done) so that you might be brought up before My eyes."
Tâ Hâ,20,40,"(And) when your sister, (posing as a stranger,) walking along, said (to Pharaoh’s family): Shall I point out to you (a woman) who will nurse this (infant)? Then We brought you back to your mother (on the pretext of nursing) so that she might cool her eyes and might not feel aggrieved as well. And you killed a man (a disbeliever of Pharaoh’s people). Then We delivered you from (that) agony (too), and tested and assessed you through many trials. Then you stayed amongst the people of Madyan for many years. Musa (Moses)! Then you came (here) at the time fixed (by Allah. He was then exactly forty years old)."
Tâ Hâ,20,41,And (now) I have chosen you for Myself (for the task of Messengership and the exceptional favour).
Tâ Hâ,20,42,"Go, you and your brother (Harun [Aaron]), with My signs and do not slacken in remembering Me."
Tâ Hâ,20,43,"Go, both of you, to Pharaoh; surely, he has transgressed all bounds in rebellion."
Tâ Hâ,20,44,So talk to him politely. He may perhaps accept admonition or fear (My wrath).’
Tâ Hâ,20,45,"Both of them submitted: ‘O our Lord, we fear lest he should commit some excess against us, or become (more) rebellious.’"
Tâ Hâ,20,46,(Allah) said: ‘Do not fear. I am indeed with you both. I hear and see (all).
Tâ Hâ,20,47,"So, go you both to him and say: We are (the Messengers) sent by your Lord. So (set free) the Children of Israel (from your slavery and) send them with us. And do not persecute them (anymore). Surely, we have brought you a sign from your Lord. And peace be upon him who follows guidance!"
Tâ Hâ,20,48,"Verily, it has been revealed to us that the torment will come upon (every) such person that rejects (the Messenger) and turns away from him.’"
Tâ Hâ,20,49,(Pharaoh) said: ‘O Musa (Moses)! Who is the Lord of you both?’
Tâ Hâ,20,50,"Musa (Moses) said: ‘Our Lord is He Who brought everything into being (as most suitable), then guided it (according to its potential).’"
Tâ Hâ,20,51,"(Pharaoh) said: ‘So, what was the fate of former people (who did not believe in your Lord)?’"
Tâ Hâ,20,52,"(Musa [Moses]) said: ‘The knowledge about them is recorded (and saved) in a Book with My Lord. My Lord does not go wrong, nor does He forget.’"
Tâ Hâ,20,53,He is the One Who made the earth habitable for you and provided therein paths for you (to travel) and sent down water from the sky. Then by means of that (water) We bring forth (from the earth) pairs of various kinds of vegetation.
Tâ Hâ,20,54,"Eat and pasture your cattle. Surely, there are signs in it for the wise."
Tâ Hâ,20,55,"We created you from this (very soil of the earth), and We shall return you into the same, and shall bring you forth from the very same once more."
Tâ Hâ,20,56,"And surely We showed him (Pharaoh) all Our signs (bestowed upon Musa [Moses] and Harun [Aaron]), but he belied and refused to believe."
Tâ Hâ,20,57,"He said: ‘Musa (Moses), have you come to us to drive us out of our land with your magic?"
Tâ Hâ,20,58,"So we shall also bring you magic resembling it. Therefore, settle an appointment between us and yourself (for the contest) which neither we nor you shall violate. (The place of contest) is to be an open and smooth ground.’"
Tâ Hâ,20,59,"(Musa [Moses]) said: ‘The day of your promise is the Eid (‘Id) Day (the day of Annual Festival), and that (on that day) all the people are to assemble there early in the forenoon.’"
Tâ Hâ,20,60,"Then Pharaoh went back (from the meeting), put together his (schemes of) pretension and deception and then came back (at the appointed time)."
Tâ Hâ,20,61,"Musa (Moses) said to them(the sorcerers): ‘Woe to you! (Beware!) Do not invent a lie against Allah lest He should eliminate you by torment. And surely, he who fabricates a lie (against Allah) is a failure.’"
Tâ Hâ,20,62,"Thereupon, they (the sorcerers) disputed amongst themselves about their affair and started whispering inaudibly."
Tâ Hâ,20,63,"They said: ‘These two are really magicians who have the intention to drive you out of your land with sorcery, and put an end to your exemplary culture and religion."
Tâ Hâ,20,64,"(They mutually decided.) So, collect all your tricks (of magic), and come into the arena (together) in a queue, and the one who prevails today will be victorious.’"
Tâ Hâ,20,65,"(The magicians) said: ‘O Musa (Moses), either you cast (your thing) or we become the first ones to cast.’"
Tâ Hâ,20,66,"(Musa [Moses]) said: ‘Rather you cast down.’ Then the sight was that suddenly their cords and rods, by the effect of their magic, seemed to Musa (Moses) as if they were slithering (on the ground)."
Tâ Hâ,20,67,Now Musa (Moses) felt a sort of hidden fear in his heart.
Tâ Hâ,20,68,"We said (to Musa [Moses]): ‘Do not fear. Verily, you will have the upper hand."
Tâ Hâ,20,69,"And cast down (this staff) that is in your right hand (on the ground). It will swallow up that (craft) which they have contrived (artificially). Whatever they have wrought is but a deceitful trick of a sorcerer, and wherever a magician may come, he will not be successful.’"
Tâ Hâ,20,70,(Then things happened the same way.) So all the sorcerers were made to fall down in prostration (and) said: ‘We embrace faith in the Lord of Harun (Aaron) and Musa (Moses).’
Tâ Hâ,20,71,"(Pharaoh) said: ‘You have embraced faith in Him before I grant you permission. Surely, he (Musa [Moses]) is also your chief (trainer) who has taught you magic. So, (now) I shall certainly cut off your hands and your feet on the opposite sides and shall certainly crucify you on the palm trunks. Then you shall come to know for sure which of us is sterner in inflicting torture and lasts for a longer term.’"
Tâ Hâ,20,72,"(The magicians) said: ‘We shall not at all prefer you to the clear signs that have come to us. By that (Lord) Who has created us, decide whatever you want to do, for you can decide merely about (this few days’) worldly life."
Tâ Hâ,20,73,"We have indeed believed in our Lord in order that He forgives us our sins, and also (forgives) that sorcery to which you forced us, and Allah is the Best and Ever-Abiding.’"
Tâ Hâ,20,74,"Surely, whoever comes to his Lord as an evildoer, certainly for him is Hell. (And it is such a torment) wherein he will neither die nor survive."
Tâ Hâ,20,75,"And whoever comes to His presence as a believer (and) has (also) done good deeds, it is they for whom are high ranks."
Tâ Hâ,20,76,(Those) are evergreen gardens beneath which streams flow. (They) will dwell therein forever. And that is the reward for the one who purifies himself (of the impurity and indecency of disbelief and immorality).
Tâ Hâ,20,77,"And certainly We sent Revelation to Musa (Moses): ‘Move out at night taking My servants with you. So, make a dry path in the river (by striking your staff). Have no fear to be overtaken (by Pharaoh), nor be afraid (of drowning).’"
Tâ Hâ,20,78,"Then Pharaoh chased them with his troops. So, the (waves of the) river swept over them as much as they covered them up."
Tâ Hâ,20,79,"And Pharaoh led his people astray, and did not guide them to the right path."
Tâ Hâ,20,80,"O Children of Israel! (Realize!) Certainly, We delivered you from your enemy, and gave you the promise of (coming to) the right of (Mount) Tur, and (there) We sent down to you the manna and the quails."
Tâ Hâ,20,81,"(And He said to you:) ‘Eat of the pure things that We have provided for you, and do not exceed limits in that, or My wrath will become inevitable for you. And he on whom My wrath comes due is in truth destroyed.’"
Tâ Hâ,20,82,"And I am surely Most Forgiving to him who repents and affirms faith and behaves piously, then sticks to guidance (firmly)."
Tâ Hâ,20,83,"And, O Musa (Moses), why did you hasten (in coming to Tur ahead of) your people?"
Tâ Hâ,20,84,"(Musa [Moses]) submitted: ‘They too are coming behind me, and I have hastened to appear before Your presence (possessed by love and ecstasy) in order that You may be pleased, O my Lord!’"
Tâ Hâ,20,85,(Allah) said: ‘We have indeed put your people to trial after you (came away) and Samiri has led them astray.’
Tâ Hâ,20,86,"So, Musa (Moses) returned to his people, angered and grieved, (and) said: ‘O my people, did your Lord not give you a fair promise? Had a long time lapsed on you in (the fulfilment of) the promise? (Or) did you wish that the wrath of your Lord should come due (and befall) you? So you have violated (your) promise to me.’"
Tâ Hâ,20,87,"They said: ‘We have not violated our promise to you of our own will, but (what happened is that) we were loaded with the heavy burden of the ornaments of the people, so we cast them (into the fire); then similarly, Samiri (too) cast them away.’"
Tâ Hâ,20,88,Then he (Samiri) moulded (out of the molten ornaments) a statue of a calf for them which produced a sound like that of a cow. Then they said: ‘This is your Lord and the Lord of Musa (Moses too). So he (Samiri) forgot (at this point).’
Tâ Hâ,20,89,"Well, did they not see (even this much) that this (calf) could not answer them a word, nor had it any power to cause them any loss or profit?"
Tâ Hâ,20,90,"Earlier, Harun (Aaron also) had said to them, (warning): ‘O people, you have undergone a trial by virtue of this (calf), whilst your Lord is (not this,) but surely (He) the Most Kind One. So follow me and obey my command.’"
Tâ Hâ,20,91,They said: ‘We shall hold fast to its (worship) until Musa (Moses) comes back to us.’
Tâ Hâ,20,92,"Musa (Moses) said: ‘O Harun (Aaron), when you saw them erring, what stopped you,"
Tâ Hâ,20,93,"(Moreover, who prohibited you) from following my way (in forbidding them fiercely)? Did you disobey me?’"
Tâ Hâ,20,94,"(Harun [Aaron]) said: ‘O son of my mother, seize me not by my beard or my head. (In being harsh) I feared you would say: You have created division amongst the Children of Israel and have not safeguarded my word.’"
Tâ Hâ,20,95,"(Musa [Moses]) said: ‘Samiri, (tell me,) what is the matter with you?’"
Tâ Hâ,20,96,"He said: ‘I saw what these people had not seen. I took a handful (of dust) from the footstep of the angel (that visited you); then I cast it (into the model of the calf), and this way my (lower) self made (it) attractive to me.’"
Tâ Hâ,20,97,"Musa (Moses) said: ‘So (get out from here and) go away. There is for you a lifelong (punishment) that you will keep saying (to everyone): Touch (me) not, (touch me not). And there is yet another promise (of punishment) for you which will not be averted at all. And look at this (self-made) god of yours to which you held fast (in worship). We will surely burn it and scatter (its dust) well over the river."
Tâ Hâ,20,98,(O my people! He) Allah alone is your God apart from Whom there is no God. He has encompassed everything in (His) knowledge.’
Tâ Hâ,20,99,"(O Esteemed Beloved!) Thus We communicate to you news about the (communities) who have passed away, and We have surely given you from Our exclusive presence the Reminder (i.e., an Admonishing Book)."
Tâ Hâ,20,100,Whoever turns away from it will certainly carry an unmanageable burden on the Day of Rising.
Tâ Hâ,20,101,"They will (remain) in this (torment) forever, and it will be a very evil burden for them on the Day of Rising."
Tâ Hâ,20,102,"The Day when the trumpet will be blown, We shall assemble the evildoers with their bodies and eyes turned blue (due to intense fear and loss of sight),"
Tâ Hâ,20,103,Inaudibly whispering to one another: ‘You stayed in the world hardly for ten days.’
Tâ Hâ,20,104,"We know best what they will be saying, whilst one of them better in wisdom and deeds will say: ‘You have not stayed (in the world) for more than a day.’"
Tâ Hâ,20,105,"And they ask you concerning mountains. So say: ‘My Lord will blow them off as dust particles,"
Tâ Hâ,20,106,"Then will change it into a levelled, barren land,"
Tâ Hâ,20,107,In which you will find neither any depression nor any elevation.’
Tâ Hâ,20,108,"On that Day, people will tread on behind the caller, and there will be no deviation in (following) him. And all voices will be hushed due to the Majesty of the Most Kind (Lord). So you will not hear anything except a faint sound of a stir."
Tâ Hâ,20,109,"On that Day, no intercession shall be fruitful except his (intercession) whom the Most Kind (Lord) has granted leave (and permission) and with whose word He is pleased (such as Prophets and Messengers, Allah’s chosen and pious servants, Godwary slaves, innocent children, and many other devoted servants of Allah whose intercession is validated)."
Tâ Hâ,20,110,"He knows all those (things) which are ahead of them and which are behind them, and they cannot encompass His (knowledge) with (their) knowledge."
Tâ Hâ,20,111,"And (all) faces will bow down before the holy presence of the Ever-Living (and) Self-Subsisting (Lord), and surely he who bears the burden of wrongdoing will crumble to failure."
Tâ Hâ,20,112,And whoever does righteous deeds and is also blessed with faith will fear neither any injustice nor any harm.
Tâ Hâ,20,113,"And in this way have We sent down (this last Revealed Book) in the Arabic tongue (in the shape of) the Qur’an, and have explained in it more often than not matters inspiring fear (of torment, in diverse ways,) so that they may become Godfearing, or this (Qur’an) may inculcate in their (hearts a passion for the acceptance of admonition, or) the remembrance (of the Last Day)."
Tâ Hâ,20,114,"So Most High and Exalted is Allah. He alone is the True Sovereign. And do not hasten in (reciting) the Qur’an before its revelation is fully accomplished to you. And always submit (before the holy presence of your Lord): ‘O my Lord, increase me further in knowledge.’"
Tâ Hâ,20,115,"And truly, (far) earlier than this, We had given a strict command to Adam but he forgot. And We did not observe in him any intention (to disobey) at all (it was just an omission)."
Tâ Hâ,20,116,"And (recall the time) when We commanded the angels: ‘Prostrate yourselves before Adam,’ they fell down in prostration except Iblis. He refused."
Tâ Hâ,20,117,"Then We said: ‘O Adam, verily, this (Satan) is an enemy to you and your wife. So let him not get you both ousted from Paradise; then you shall be put to toil."
Tâ Hâ,20,118,"Surely, there is this (comfort) for you (in Paradise) that you will neither feel hungry nor go naked."
Tâ Hâ,20,119,"And that you will neither feel thirsty here, nor suffer the heat of the sun.’"
Tâ Hâ,20,120,"But Satan suggested him (an) idea. He said: ‘O Adam! Shall I inform you of the tree of immortality (in the Paradise of Allah’s nearness), and also the (secret of that divine) dominion which will neither fall nor cease to exist?’"
Tâ Hâ,20,121,"So (in fondness of that station of eternal nearness to Allah) both ate the fruit of that tree. So, their private parts became exposed to them, and both began to stick to their (bodies) the leaves of (the trees in) Paradise. And Adam made a mistake (by way of omission) in (understanding) his Lord’s command.* So he could not achieve the aim (of eternal life in Paradise)."
Tâ Hâ,20,122,"Then his Lord chose him (for His nearness and Prophethood), and turned to him (in His exceptional forgiveness and mercy), and showed the path to the coveted destination."
Tâ Hâ,20,123,"(Allah) said: ‘Go down from here, all of you. Some of you will be enemies to some others. Then if there comes to you any Guidance (Revelation) from Me, whoever will follow My Guidance will neither lose the straight path (in the world), nor face misfortune (in the Hereafter)."
Tâ Hâ,20,124,"And whoever turns away from My direction and guidance (i.e., remembrance and advice), his worldly sustenance will be narrowed, and We shall raise him blind on the Day of Resurrection (as well).’"
Tâ Hâ,20,125,"He will say: ‘O my Lord, why have You raised me up blind (Today) whereas I had vision (in the world)?’"
Tâ Hâ,20,126,"(Allah) will say: ‘In like manner, Our signs came to you (in the world), but you forgot them, and the same way you (too) will be forgotten Today.’"
Tâ Hâ,20,127,"And that is how We recompense the one who exceeds the limit (in sins), and does not believe in the Revelations of his Lord, and surely the torment of the Last Day is extremely severe and everlasting."
Tâ Hâ,20,128,"Has (this fact) not guided them as to how many people We destroyed before them in whose dwelling places they (now) walk about? Undoubtedly, in this are (many) signs for the wise."
Tâ Hâ,20,129,"And had it not been settled already by your Lord, and the time (of the Day of Resurrection) not fixed (for their torment, befalling them) the calamity (right now) would have been inevitable."
Tâ Hâ,20,130,"So bear their (heart-rending) talk patiently and glorify your Lord with His praise before the rising of the sun (in Fajr [Dawn] Prayer) and before its setting (in the ‘Asr [Afternoon] Prayer) and glorify Him in the early hours of night (the Maghrib [Sunset] and ‘Isha’ [Night] Prayer) and also at the ends of the day (in Zuhr [Midday] Prayer when the first half of the day ends and the second half starts. O Esteemed Beloved, all this is designed) so that you may be pleased."
Tâ Hâ,20,131,And do not glance with amazement and wonder at the adornments (of worldly life) which We have provided to some classes (of the disbelieving materialists) for their (short-term) luxury so that We may cause for them a trial in these (very things). And the provision of your Lord (in the Hereafter) is the best and eternal.
Tâ Hâ,20,132,"And enjoin Prayer on your family and strictly adhere to it. And We do not ask for provision from you, (rather) We provide for you. And it is the act of fearing God that brings about best results."
Tâ Hâ,20,133,"And (the disbelievers) say: ‘Why does this (Prophet) not bring us any sign from his Lord?’ Has there not come to them (the Qur’an,) a clear proof of the things (mentioned) in the former Books?"
Tâ Hâ,20,134,"And had We destroyed them through some calamity already, they would have said: ‘O Lord, why did You not send us any Messenger so that we might have followed Your Revelations before we were humiliated and disgraced?’"
Tâ Hâ,20,135,"Say: ‘Everyone is waiting, so wait on. You will soon come to know who are the people of the right path and who are the guided ones.’"
The Prophets,21,1,"The time of reckoning for people has drawn near but, rapt in heedlessness, they are disinclined (to obedience)."
The Prophets,21,2,"Whenever some new admonition comes to them from their Lord, they listen to it (with such carelessness) as if they are engaged in sport."
The Prophets,21,3,Their hearts have become neglectful and (these) wrongdoers whisper (against you) inaudibly: ‘He is but a human being like you. Do you (even then) submit to (his) magic whilst you can see?’
The Prophets,21,4,"(The Esteemed Prophet) said: ‘My Lord knows (every) word uttered in the heavens and the earth and He is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.’"
The Prophets,21,5,"But (the wrongdoers go so far as to) say: ‘This (Qur’an) comprises (things seen in) confused dreams. Nay! He has invented it (himself). Nay, he is (in fact) a poet. (If he is a true Prophet,) let him (also) bring us some sign as the former (Prophets) were sent (with signs).’"
The Prophets,21,6,"Every community whom We destroyed before them disbelieved (in these signs). So, will these people believe?"
The Prophets,21,7,"And, (O Esteemed Beloved,) We sent only men (as Prophets) before you (also). We used to send them Revelations. So, (O people,) if you do not know (yourselves), ask the people of remembrance."
The Prophets,21,8,"And We did not create them (the Prophets) with such bodies as would not eat food, nor were they to live (their visible life in the world) forever."
The Prophets,21,9,Then We fulfilled Our promise to them. So We delivered them and those whom We liked and We destroyed the transgressors.
The Prophets,21,10,"Verily, We have revealed to you the Book, which contains (means and substance for) your admonition. So do you not have sense?"
The Prophets,21,11,"And how many communities, which were unjust, did We destroy and We raised up other communities after them!"
The Prophets,21,12,"Then, when they sensed Our punishment (approaching), they started fleeing fast from there."
The Prophets,21,13,"(It was said to them:) ‘Do not flee in haste, and return to the same place where you were given comforts, and (go back) to your (luxurious) dwellings. It is likely that you are interrogated.’"
The Prophets,21,14,"They said: ‘Woe to us! Surely, we were wrongdoers.’"
The Prophets,21,15,So this is what they always bewailed till We made them like a reaped field (and a heap) of extinguished fire.
The Prophets,21,16,And We have not created the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them (useless) as a sport.
The Prophets,21,17,"If We intended to take up some sport, We would adopt it on Our own if at all We were to do (so)."
The Prophets,21,18,"Nay, We strike at falsehood with the truth with full force. So, the truth crushes it and it (i.e., the falsehood) gets destroyed. And you are bound to ruin yourselves owing to what you utter."
The Prophets,21,19,"And whoever is in the heavens and in the earth (serves and) belongs to Him alone. And those (angels) who (remain) in His presence are not arrogant towards His worship, nor do they become weary (of carrying out His obedience)."
The Prophets,21,20,"They glorify (Him) night and day ceaselessly, and do not observe even a momentary pause."
The Prophets,21,21,Have they (the disbelievers) taken from (the contents of) the earth gods that can raise (the dead) alive?
The Prophets,21,22,"Had there been in these two (the heaven and the earth) other gods (as well) apart from Allah, then both would have been destroyed. So, Holy is Allah, the Lord of the Throne, Transcendent above all (the things) that these (polytheists) utter."
The Prophets,21,23,He cannot be questioned for what He does and they will be questioned (for every action).
The Prophets,21,24,"Have they (the disbelievers) taken gods other than Him? Say: ‘Bring your proof. This (Qur’an) is the reminder of those who are with me and (also) the reminder of those who had been before me.’ But most of them do not know the truth, so they are averse to it."
The Prophets,21,25,"And We did not send any Messenger before you, but We frequented the same revelation to him: ‘There is no God but I, so worship Me (alone).’"
The Prophets,21,26,"And they say: ‘The Most Kind (Lord) has taken (angels as His) children.’ Holy is He. Nay, (the angels whom they consider His children) are but (Allah’s) esteemed servants."
The Prophets,21,27,"They do not precede Him in (uttering) any word, and they remain engaged in carrying out only His command."
The Prophets,21,28,"He (Allah) knows what is before them and what is behind them, and they do not intercede (before His presence) but for him with whom He is pleased. And they remain fearful of His Awe and Magnificence."
The Prophets,21,29,"And who is it amongst them to say: ‘I am a God besides (Allah)’? So, him shall We award Hell as punishment. This is the way We punish the wrongdoers."
The Prophets,21,30,"And have the disbelievers not seen that the whole heavenly universe and the earth were (all) joined together as one unit, and then We split them apart? And We originated (the life of) living organism (on earth) from water. So do they not accept faith (even after learning these facts brought forth by the Qur’an)?"
The Prophets,21,31,And We set up firm mountains in the earth lest it should shake with them whilst rotating (in its orbit). And We made in this (earth) broad highways so that people might find routes (to reach different destinations).
The Prophets,21,32,"And We made the heavens (i.e., the upper spheres of the earth) a secure roof (in order to save the inhabitants of the earth from adverse effects of fatal forces and aggressive waves shooting towards the earth from space), and they turn away from these signs (of upper spheres)."
The Prophets,21,33,"And (Allah) is He Who created the night and the day, and (also) the sun and the moon. All (heavenly bodies) are continually floating fast in their respective orbits."
The Prophets,21,34,"And We have not granted eternity to any human being before you (in the physical life of the world). So, if you pass away (from here), will they live forever?"
The Prophets,21,35,"Every soul has to taste death, and We make you undergo foul and fair for trial, and towards Us will you be returned."
The Prophets,21,36,"And when the disbelievers see you, they just start mocking you (and say:) ‘Is this the one who talks about your gods (with rejection and denial)?’ And yet it is they themselves who reject the mention of the Most Kind (Lord)."
The Prophets,21,37,"Man has been created (instinctually) from haste. I shall soon show you My signs, so do not seek hurry."
The Prophets,21,38,And they say: ‘When will this promise (of torment) be (fulfilled) if you are truthful?’
The Prophets,21,39,"If the disbelievers knew the time when they will not be able to keep off the Fire (of Hell) from their faces and their backs, nor will they be helped (then they would not call out to hasten the torment)."
The Prophets,21,40,"In fact, it (the Last Day) will come upon them all of a sudden and stun them. So neither will they have the power to avert it, nor will they be granted respite."
The Prophets,21,41,"And, of course, the Messengers were mocked before you too. Then those who ridiculed were beset by the same (torment) they used to make fun of."
The Prophets,21,42,"Say: ‘Who can guard and save you from (the punishment of) the Most Kind (Lord) by night and by day?’ In fact, they keep away from the remembrance of the (same) Lord."
The Prophets,21,43,Have they any gods apart from Us capable of saving them (from the torment)? They do not have any power even to help themselves. Nor will they get any support and alliance from Us.
The Prophets,21,44,"Nay, We provided for them and their fathers (generous luxuries) so much so that their life spans also gradually prolonged. So, do they not perceive that (through Islamic conquests) We are gradually reducing the land (under their control) from all borders? So, will they dominate (now)?"
The Prophets,21,45,Say: ‘I warn you only through Revelation.’ But the deaf do not hear the call whenever they are warned.
The Prophets,21,46,"If (even) a minor calamity from your Lord is to really touch them, they will surely say: ‘Woe to us. Certainly, we were the unjust.’"
The Prophets,21,47,"And on the Day of Resurrection, We shall set up balances of fairness and justice. So no soul will be wronged in the least. And if there is (someone’s deed) equal to the weight of a mustard seed, We shall bring forth that (as well). And We are Sufficient to take account."
The Prophets,21,48,"And indeed, We granted Musa (Moses) and Harun ([Aaron] the Book, the Torah) the criterion distinguishing (between right and wrong) and (the embodiment of) light and admonition for the Godfearing."
The Prophets,21,49,(They are) those who fear their Lord unseen and who dread (the calamities of) the Hour (of Rising).
The Prophets,21,50,This (Qur’an) is the Most Blessed Admonition which We have revealed. Do you deny it?
The Prophets,21,51,"And surely, We awarded Ibrahim (Abraham) understanding and guidance (commensurate with his rank) well before, and We knew him full well (his competence and capability)."
The Prophets,21,52,"When he said to his father (i.e., uncle) and his people: ‘What idols are these (whose worship) you are stuck to, squatting?’"
The Prophets,21,53,They said: ‘We found our fathers worshipping them.’
The Prophets,21,54,"Ibrahim (Abraham) said: ‘Surely, you and your fathers (all) were in manifest error.’"
The Prophets,21,55,"They said: ‘Have you (alone) brought the truth, or are you (just) one of the entertainers?’"
The Prophets,21,56,"Ibrahim (Abraham) said: ‘The truth is that your Lord, Who created them (all), is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, and I am of those who bear witness to this (truth)."
The Prophets,21,57,"And I swear by Allah, I shall certainly implement a plan against your idols after you turn back and go away.’"
The Prophets,21,58,Then Ibrahim (Abraham) broke those (idols) into pieces except the biggest (idol) so that they might turn to it.
The Prophets,21,59,"They said: ‘Who has done this to our gods? Surely, he is of the wrongdoers.’"
The Prophets,21,60,(Some of the) people said: ‘We have heard of a young man who speaks of them (with denial and disgust). He is known as Ibrahim (Abraham).’
The Prophets,21,61,They said: ‘Bring him before the people so that they may see (him).’
The Prophets,21,62,"(When Ibrahim [Abraham] came) they said: ‘O Ibrahim (Abraham), is it you who have done this to our gods?’"
The Prophets,21,63,"He said: ‘Nay, this biggest (idol) of them would have done this. So ask these (very idols) if they can speak.’"
The Prophets,21,64,"Then they turned to their own (reflections) and said: ‘Surely, you yourselves have become the wrongdoers (by worshipping these helpless idols incapable of doing anything).’"
The Prophets,21,65,"Then they were turned upside down upon their heads (i.e., their thinking reverted and they said: ‘Ibrahim [Abraham]), surely you yourself know that they do not speak.’"
The Prophets,21,66,"(Ibrahim [Abraham]) said: ‘Then do you worship apart from Allah these (idols) which can neither bring you any benefit, nor do you any harm?"
The Prophets,21,67,Fie on you and (also) on these (idols) that you worship apart from Allah! Do you not then have sense?’
The Prophets,21,68,They said: ‘Burn him and help your (ruined) gods if you have to do (something).’
The Prophets,21,69,"We said: ‘O fire, be cool and become absolute safety for Ibrahim (Abraham).’"
The Prophets,21,70,And they had intended an evil plot against Ibrahim (Abraham) but We failed them badly.
The Prophets,21,71,"And (from Iraq) We rescued Ibrahim (Abraham) and Lut (Lot, his nephew, the son of his brother Haran,) towards (Syria), the land in which We have placed blessings for the people of the world."
The Prophets,21,72,"And We blessed him with (a son) Ishaq (Isaac) and (by his prayer a grandson) Ya‘qub (Jacob) in addition, and We made all of them pious."
The Prophets,21,73,"And We made them the leaders (of mankind) who guided (people) by Our command, and We sent to them Revelation (giving commands) to do good deeds, establish Prayer and pay Zakat (the Alms-due). And all of them were Our devoted worshippers."
The Prophets,21,74,"And We (also) bestowed upon Lut (Lot) wisdom and knowledge, and We delivered him from the town whose people practised filthy deeds. They were indeed a people with extremely evil (and) immoral character."
The Prophets,21,75,"And We admitted Lut (Lot) to the fold of Our Mercy. Truly, he was of the pious."
The Prophets,21,76,And (recall) Nuh (Noah as well) when he called (on Us) before these (Prophets). So We granted his prayer. Then We delivered him and his family from great distress and grief.
The Prophets,21,77,"And We helped him against (most torturous circumstances of) the people who rejected Our Revelations. Surely, they (too) were a very evil people, so We drowned them all."
The Prophets,21,78,"And (also call to mind the account of) Dawud (David) and Sulayman (Solomon) when both of them were to decide (the dispute) of a crop when the goats of a tribe, unattended by the shepherd, entered the field at night (and destroyed it). And We were witnessing their judgment."
The Prophets,21,79,So We alone taught Sulayman ([Solomon] the way to make that judgment) and blessed them all with reason and knowledge. And We made (even) the mountains and the birds subservient to (the command of) Dawud (David). They all celebrated (Our) praise (with him jointly). And it was We Who were doing (all this).
The Prophets,21,80,And We taught Dawud (David) the art of making the coats of mail for you to protect you from injury in your battle. Are you then grateful?
The Prophets,21,81,"And to Sulayman ([Solomon] We subjected) the violent wind which used to blow by his command (from all sides and directions) towards (Syria), the land in which We have placed blessings. And We know everything (full) well."
The Prophets,21,82,"And (We) also made (subservient to Sulayman [Solomon]) some of satans (devils and jinn) who dived for him (into the seas) and, besides that, accomplished other services also (under his command). And We alone kept watch over them (devils)."
The Prophets,21,83,"And (call to mind the account of) Ayyub (Job) when he called out to his Lord: ‘Misery has laid a hand on me, and You are the Most Merciful of all the merciful.’"
The Prophets,21,84,"So We granted his prayer, and We removed the misery that was afflicting him. And We (also) gave him back his family, and (bestowed upon him) the like of them along with them. This is an exceptional mercy from Us, and Advice for those who are devoted to Our worship (that is how Allah rewards patience and gratitude)."
The Prophets,21,85,"And (also recall) Isma‘il (Ishmael), and Idris and Dhu al-Kifl. They were all steadfast men of patience."
The Prophets,21,86,"And We admitted them to (the embrace of) Our mercy. Surely, they were of the pious."
The Prophets,21,87,"And (also remember) Dhu al-Nun (the Prophet whom the fish swallowed) when he went away enraged (at his people). So he thought that We would not cause him any distress (during that journey). Then he cried out (entangled) in (the layers of) the darkness (of night, under the sea and in the fish belly): ‘There is no God except You. Glory be to You! Surely, I was of those who wrong (their souls).’"
The Prophets,21,88,"So We granted his prayer and We delivered him from grief. And likewise, We always deliver the believers."
The Prophets,21,89,"And (remember) Zakariyya ([Zacharias] as well) when he called out to his Lord: ‘O my Lord, leave me not single and You are the Best of all inheritors.’"
The Prophets,21,90,"So We granted his prayer, and We blessed him with Yahya (John) and, for his sake, made his wife healthy (i.e., fertile). Surely, they (all) used to hasten in (doing) pious deeds and used to call on Us (feeling) eager, fond, fearful and frightened, and used to humble before Our presence in tearful submissions."
The Prophets,21,91,"And (call to mind) that (embodiment of purity) Maryam ([Mary] as well) who guarded her chastity. Then We breathed into her of Our Spirit, and We made her and her son (‘Isa [Jesus]) a sign (of Our power) for the people of the world."
The Prophets,21,92,"Surely, these (people) are your Umma ([Community] and all) are one Umma. And I am your Lord, so worship Me (alone)."
The Prophets,21,93,And these (People of the Book) split up their Din [Religion] into pieces amongst themselves. To Us they all will return.
The Prophets,21,94,"So whoever does good deeds and is a believer as well, (the reward of) his effort will not be refused, and surely We are writing down (all) his deeds."
The Prophets,21,95,"And it is not possible that the people of the town whom We destroyed will not return to Us (after death),"
The Prophets,21,96,"Until when Gog and Magog are let loose, and they will come down running from every high place,"
The Prophets,21,97,"And the true promise (of the Day of Resurrection) will draw near, then the eyes of the disbelievers will suddenly fix staring (and they will cry out:) ‘Woe to us! We were indeed oblivious of (the arrival of) this (Day); in fact, we were unjust.’"
The Prophets,21,98,"Surely, you and the (idols) you worship besides Allah (all) are the fuel of Hell. You are going to enter it."
The Prophets,21,99,"Had they been (true) gods, they would not have entered Hell. And all of them will stay in it forever."
The Prophets,21,100,"There will be their (sighing and wailing, a) roar of screaming in it, and they will not be able to hear in it anything (else)."
The Prophets,21,101,"Surely, those for whom good has already been decreed from Us will be kept away from (Hell)."
The Prophets,21,102,"They shall not hear even its slightest hissing sound, and they shall live forever amongst those (bounties) which their hearts will long for."
The Prophets,21,103,"(Even) the Greatest Horror (of the Day of Rising) will not grieve them and the angels will welcome them, (saying:) ‘This is (but) your Day which you were promised.’"
The Prophets,21,104,"On that Day, We shall roll up the (whole) heavenly universe as the written papers are rolled up. The way We created (the universe) the first time, We shall repeat the same process of creation (after its extinction). We have made it binding upon Us to fulfil this promise. We will do (repeat it)."
The Prophets,21,105,And surely We wrote in the al-Zabur (the Psalms) after (stating the) admonition that the inheritors of the earth (in the Hereafter) will be My pious servants.
The Prophets,21,106,"Surely, there is for the devoted worshippers a guarantee and sufficient provision in this (Qur’an of achieving the objective)."
The Prophets,21,107,"And, (O Esteemed Messenger,) We have not sent you but as a mercy for all the worlds."
The Prophets,21,108,Say: ‘This is what is revealed to me that your God is One God (only). Do you then accept Islam?’
The Prophets,21,109,"Then, if they turn away, say: ‘I have conveyed to you all alike, and I do not know (on my own) whether that (torment) which you are promised is near or far."
The Prophets,21,110,"He surely knows what you utter loudly, and also knows (all) that you keep secret."
The Prophets,21,111,"And I do not know (on my own) that this (delaying of the torment and the respite given to you) may perhaps be a trial for you, and the intention may be to provide (you) a benefit till a fixed time.’"
The Prophets,21,112,"(Our Beloved) submitted: ‘My Lord, judge (between us) with truth, and Our Lord is Ever-Merciful and He is the One Whose help is sought against the (heart-rending) words which, (O disbelievers,) you utter.’"
The Pilgrimage,22,1,"O mankind! Keep fearing your Lord. No doubt, the earthquake of the Hour of Rising is a terrible thing."
The Pilgrimage,22,2,"The Day when you see it, every suckling woman (i.e., mother) will forget the (infant) she was suckling and every pregnant woman will abort her fetus. And, (O observer,) you will see people in a drunken (state), whereas actually they will not be drunk, but the torment of Allah will be (so) severe (that everyone will lose his senses)."
The Pilgrimage,22,3,"And there are some people who dispute about Allah without any knowledge and understanding and follow every disobedient Satan,"
The Pilgrimage,22,4,"(Satan) for whom it is written that whoever takes him for a friend, he will lead him astray, and show him the road to the torment of Hell."
The Pilgrimage,22,5,"O people! If you are in doubt about being raised up (after death), then (contemplate your creation and evolution). We initiated your creation (i.e., chemical genesis) from (the extract of) clay,* then (your biological genesis) from a sperm drop (zygote), then from a hanging mass (clinging to the uterus like a leech—embryo) and then from a lump of flesh looking chewed, having manifest contours of elementary formation of some parts of the body and others yet to form (fetus), so that We might show you (Our power and the trueness of Our Revelations). So We cause whom We please to stay in the wombs till an appointed time. Then We bring you forth as an infant, then (nourish you) so that you may reach your youth. And of you are (also) some who die (early), and some are brought to the age of senility so that (he may see this state too that) having learnt so much knowledge, now he knows (just) nothing (once more). And you see the earth completely dry (i.e., dead) and, when We shower water on it, a stir of freshness and fertility runs through it. And it swells enriched, and puts forth in pairs every kind of blooming and beauteous vegetation."
The Pilgrimage,22,6,"(All) this (keeps happening) because Allah alone is the Real (Creator and All-Sustaining), and doubtlessly, He alone gives life to the dead and certainly, He alone is All-Powerful to do everything."
The Pilgrimage,22,7,"And, certainly, the Last Hour is bound to come. There is no doubt about it. And, verily, Allah shall raise up alive those who are in the graves."
The Pilgrimage,22,8,"And there are some of the people who dispute about Allah (His Essence, Attributes and Powers) without knowledge and understanding, and without any guidance and logic, and without any enlightening Book (sent down from heaven),"
The Pilgrimage,22,9,"Turning his neck (in arrogance) so that he may lead (others also) astray from the path of Allah. For him is disgrace in the world (too), and on the Day of Resurrection, We shall make him taste the burning torment."
The Pilgrimage,22,10,"This is because of the doings which your hands sent forth, and indeed, Allah is not in the least unjust to His servants."
The Pilgrimage,22,11,"And amongst people there is also one who worships Allah (keeping just) on the border-line (of Din [Religion]). So if some (worldly) benefit reaches him, he feels contented with this (Din [Religion]), and if some trial befalls him, he turns about on his face away (from Din [Religion]). He met a loss in this world (as well as) in the Hereafter. It is this that is conspicuously a heavy loss."
The Pilgrimage,22,12,(Such a person) worships besides Allah that (idol) which can neither harm nor bring him benefit. That is indeed straying (quite) far off.
The Pilgrimage,22,13,He worships someone whose loss is nearer than his profit. What an evil helper and what an evil companion!
The Pilgrimage,22,14,"Indeed, Allah will admit those who believe and keep doing good deeds to the Gardens with streams flowing beneath them. Surely, Allah does what He wills."
The Pilgrimage,22,15,Whoever thinks that Allah will not at all help His (beloved and most exalted) Prophet in the world and in the Hereafter should tie a rope to the ceiling (of his house) and then hang and strangle (himself). Then let him see whether his plan removes that (help of Allah) at which he feels enraged.
The Pilgrimage,22,16,"And in the same way, We have revealed this (complete Qur’an) in the format of clear, logical arguments. And surely, Allah blesses with guidance whom He wills."
The Pilgrimage,22,17,"Indeed, those who believe and those who are the Jews and the Sabeans and the Christians and the Magians and those who are polytheists—verily, Allah will judge amongst (all of) them on the Day of Resurrection. Surely, Allah is witnessing everything."
The Pilgrimage,22,18,"Have you not seen that to Allah bows in prostration (the whole creation) that is in the heavens and in the earth, and the sun, and the moon and the stars, and the mountains, and the vegetable as well as the animal kingdoms and many of mankind (too)? But there are still many (human beings) for whom the torment has been proved (due to their disbelief and polytheism). And he whom Allah dishonours none can bring him honour. Indeed, Allah does what He wills."
The Pilgrimage,22,19,"There are two groups who dispute about their Lord. So those who have become disbelievers, the clothes of (Hell) Fire have been cut out (and stitched) for them. The boiling hot water will be poured over their heads."
The Pilgrimage,22,20,With it will melt whatever is in their bellies and also (their) skins.
The Pilgrimage,22,21,And for them will be hammers of iron (to strike their heads).
The Pilgrimage,22,22,"Whenever they intend to get out from there due to intense suffering, they will be turned back into it and (it will be said to them:) ‘Taste the torment of the fierce Fire.’"
The Pilgrimage,22,23,"Surely, Allah will admit those who believe and do pious deeds to the Gardens beneath which streams flow. There they will be adorned with bracelets of gold and pearls. And their clothes there will be of silk."
The Pilgrimage,22,24,And (in the world) they are directed to pure and decent talk and are guided to the favourite path (of Islam).
The Pilgrimage,22,25,"Surely, those who disbelieve and hinder (others) from the Path of Allah and this Sacred Mosque (the Ka‘ba) which We have made equal for all the people—(there is no discrimination) in it between its inhabitants and the visitors—and he who resolves in it to deviate unjustly (i.e., transgress the appointed limits and violate rights), We shall make him taste grievous torment."
The Pilgrimage,22,26,And (recall) when We fixed for Ibrahim (Abraham) the site of the House of Allah (for the construction of the Ka‘ba and ordained him:) ‘Do not associate with Me anything and keep My House (after its construction) purified and clean for those who circumambulate it and those who stand and those who kneel and prostrate themselves in Prayer.’
The Pilgrimage,22,27,"And proclaim the ±ajj (Pilgrimage) aloud amongst the people. They will approach you on foot and (mounted) on all lean camels, coming by distant tracks—"
The Pilgrimage,22,28,"So that they may avail themselves of their benefits, and invoke the Name of Allah as well (whilst slaughtering) over the cattle which Allah has provided for them (for sacrifice), during the appointed days. Then eat of them yourselves and feed the distressed and the needy."
The Pilgrimage,22,29,"Then let them cleanse their dirt (i.e., cut their hair and nails on removing ihram, the Pilgrim attire), fulfil their vows (or the remaining prescribed rituals of Pilgrimage) and make (the prescribed visitation) circumam-bulation of Allah’s Ancient House (the Ka‘ba)."
The Pilgrimage,22,30,"That is (the command). And whoever venerates the things sanctified before (the presence of) Allah, that is better for him in the sight of his Lord. (All) the cattle (i.e., quadrupeds) are made lawful for you except those whose prohibition has been recited to you. So always keep away from the filth of idols and guard yourselves against telling lies."
The Pilgrimage,22,31,"Devote yourselves wholly to Allah alone, not associating (anything as) partner with Him. And whoever associates anything as partner with Allah, (his case is as if) he fell from the sky, then birds snatched him up, or the wind blew him away down into a distant place."
The Pilgrimage,22,32,"That is the (command). And whoever venerates the signs of Allah (i.e., honouring those living beings, shrines, monumental sites, commands and prescribed duties known and recognized due to some pious association or link with Allah or Allah’s devoted servants), this (veneration) is of the Godwariness of hearts (only those whose hearts have been blessed with the fear of God venerate these signs)."
The Pilgrimage,22,33,There are benefits for you in these (sacrificial animals) for a fixed term. Then they are to arrive at the Ancient House (the Ka‘ba for sacrifice).
The Pilgrimage,22,34,"And We have appointed a sacrifice for every people so that (at the time of sacrifice) they may invoke the Name of Allah over the cattle (i.e., quadrupeds) that Allah has provided for them. And your God is (only) One God, so submit to Him alone, and, (O Beloved,) give good news to those who remain submissive."
The Pilgrimage,22,35,"(They are) the people whose hearts get into fear when Allah is mentioned, and they bear with fortitude whatever troubles touch them. And they establish Prayer, and give away out of what We have bestowed upon them."
The Pilgrimage,22,36,"And We have made for you bigger sacrificial animals (i.e., camels and cows, etc.) from amongst the signs of Allah. There is good in them for you. So line (them) up and (after lancing at the time of their slaughter) invoke the Name of Allah over them. Then, when they fall down on their sides, eat of it and (also) feed those who are sitting contented as well as the (needy) who beg. We have, this way, subjected them to you so that you may give thanks."
The Pilgrimage,22,37,"It is neither the meat (of slaughtered animals) nor their blood that reaches Allah at all, but it is the Godwariness that reaches Him from you. Thus has Allah subjected them to you so that you may proclaim Allah’s greatness (whilst sacrificing) the way He has guided you. And give glad tidings to those who practise spiritual excellence."
The Pilgrimage,22,38,"Surely, Allah removes from the men of faith (the mischief and strife of their enemies). Indeed, He does not like anyone treacherous (and) ungrateful."
The Pilgrimage,22,39,"Permission (to fight in defence against mischief, disruption and exploitation) is granted to those against whom (aggressive) war is waged, because they were oppressed and Allah is doubtlessly All-Powerful to help them (the oppressed)."
The Pilgrimage,22,40,"They are those who were unjustly expelled from their homes simply because they said: ‘Our Lord is Allah (i.e., they refused to accept the evil rule).’ And had Allah not been repelling one class of human society by the other (through progressive struggle and persistent toil), the cloisters, synagogues, churches and mosques (i.e., religious centres and places of worship of all religions) would have been ruined where Allah’s Name is abundantly commemorated. And whoever helps (the Din [Religion] of) Allah, Allah surely helps him. Allah is indeed All-Powerfull, Ever-Dominant (over all i.e., the survival of good is possible only through the process of contradiction and conflict between good and evil)."
The Pilgrimage,22,41,"(These men of truth) are those who, if We establish their rule in the earth, will establish (systems of) Prayer, (organize and control) the paying of Zakat (the Alms-due), enjoin righteousness (and piousness in the whole society) and forbid (people from) evil. And the result of all the endeavours is in the control of Allah."
The Pilgrimage,22,42,"And if these (disbelievers) reject you, then the people of Nuh (Noah) and ‘Ad and Thamud (also) denied (their Prophets),"
The Pilgrimage,22,43,"And the people of Ibrahim (Abraham) and (also) the people of Lut (Lot),"
The Pilgrimage,22,44,"And the inhabitants of Madyan (too belied). And Musa (Moses) was also rejected. So I kept giving respite to (all) the disbelievers. Ultimately, I seized them. (Say) how terrible was My punishment!"
The Pilgrimage,22,45,"Then how many a town was there which We annihilated because they were oppressors! They are fallen down on their roofs. And, (owing to their devastation,) how many a well (was) deserted, and how many a strongly built castle (is) lying ruined (as an archeological site)!"
The Pilgrimage,22,46,"Have they not travelled in the land that (perhaps by seeing these ruins) their hearts should become (such) as to understand, or the ears (such) as to hear (the truth)? So the fact is that it is not the eyes (of such people) that are blind, but the hearts, which are in the breasts, turn blind."
The Pilgrimage,22,47,And they seek from you torment in haste and Allah never goes against His promise. And (when the Hour of torment will come) then one day (of torment) with your Lord is like a thousand years according to your (scale of) counting.
The Pilgrimage,22,48,And how many a town I gave respite whilst it was given to wrongdoing and then I seized it (with torment)! And to Me (everyone) has to return.
The Pilgrimage,22,49,"Say: ‘O people, I am only an evident Warner to you (against the torment of Allah).’"
The Pilgrimage,22,50,"So they who believe and do good deeds, for them is forgiveness and bounty of (greater) honour and dignity."
The Pilgrimage,22,51,"And those who strive in (refuting) Our Verses with the idea to frustrate (Us), it is they who are the inmates of Hell."
The Pilgrimage,22,52,"And We did not send any Messenger and Prophet before you, but (it happened to them all) that when he (the Prophet or the Messenger) would recite (to the people the Revelations of Allah), Satan mixed up in their minds false doubts, and absurd ideas of his own with the Verses recited (by that Prophet). Then Allah removes those doubts from the minds of the people which Satan puts (into the minds of the listeners). And then Allah firmly establishes His Verses (in the hearts of the believers). And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise."
The Pilgrimage,22,53,"(It happens) so that Allah may make these (false ideas and absurd doubts) which Satan puts (into their minds) a trial for those people whose hearts are diseased (of hypocrisy) and whose hearts are hardened (owing to disbelief and disgust). And surely, the wrongdoers are engaged in serious rivalry;"
The Pilgrimage,22,54,"And so that those who have been given (true) knowledge may know that the (Revelation which the Messenger recited) is (based on) the truth from your Lord, so they believe in the same (and reject Satan’s suggestions) and their hearts beat in submissiveness (before the Lord). And no doubt, Allah does guide the believers to the straight path."
The Pilgrimage,22,55,"And the disbelievers will always remain in doubt about this (Holy Qur’an) until the Last Hour comes suddenly upon them, or the torment of the Day from which salvation is least possible."
The Pilgrimage,22,56,"On that Day, sovereignty will be Allah’s alone. He is the One Who will judge amongst them. So those who believe and do good deeds will (reside) in the Gardens of Bliss."
The Pilgrimage,22,57,"And those who disbelieve and reject Our Revelations, for them will be humiliating punishment."
The Pilgrimage,22,58,"And those who migrated from their (homeland) in the way of Allah (and) were then slain or died (suffering from the troubles of the way), Allah shall indeed provide for them an excellent provision (of bestowals specific to the Last Day). And, verily, Allah is the Best of providers."
The Pilgrimage,22,59,"He will indeed admit them to that (station of divine pleasure) they will be well pleased with. And Allah is indeed All-Knowing, Most Forbearing."
The Pilgrimage,22,60,"That is (the command). And whoever takes revenge in proportion to the torture inflicted upon him and then he is again wronged, Allah will surely help him. Allah is verily Most Forgiving, Most Pardoning."
The Pilgrimage,22,61,"That is because Allah causes the night to enter into the day, and causes the day to enter into the night, and indeed Allah is All-Hearing, All-Seeing."
The Pilgrimage,22,62,"And that is because Allah alone is the truth, and whatever they (the disbelievers) worship besides Him is certainly falsehood, and verily Allah is Most High, Most Great."
The Pilgrimage,22,63,Have you not seen that Allah sends down water from the sky and the earth becomes fresh and green? Allah is indeed Most Beneficent (and) All-Aware.
The Pilgrimage,22,64,"To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth. And surely, Allah is Self-Sufficient, All-Praiseworthy."
The Pilgrimage,22,65,"Have you not seen that Allah has subjected to you whatever is in the earth and (also) the vessels that sail in the sea (and rivers) by His command (i.e., law) and He withholds the heavens (i.e., spatial spheres and atmospheric fields) from falling on to the earth (under a cosmic system)? But (when He wills, they will collide) by His command. Surely, Allah is Most Compassionate, Most Merciful to mankind."
The Pilgrimage,22,66,"And He is the One Who gave you life, then He causes you to die and then will give you life again. No doubt, it is man who is highly ungrateful."
The Pilgrimage,22,67,"We have appointed for every people a way (of Islamic injunctions or worship and sacrifice) which they are to act upon. So let them not at all dispute with you over the command (of Allah). And keep calling towards your Lord. Certainly, it is you who are on the straight (path of) guidance."
The Pilgrimage,22,68,"And if they dispute with you, then say: ‘Allah knows best whatever you are doing.’"
The Pilgrimage,22,69,Allah will judge between you on the Day of Resurrection all those matters in which you used to disagree.
The Pilgrimage,22,70,"Do you not know that Allah knows all that is in the heavens and the earth? Verily, it is all (recorded) in the Book (al-Lawh al-Mahfuz). Surely, all that is (very) easy for Allah."
The Pilgrimage,22,71,"And they worship these (idols), besides Allah, for which He has not sent down any authority. Nor do they have any knowledge of (the consequence of) this (idol-worship). And there will be no helper of the wrongdoers (on the Day of Judgment)."
The Pilgrimage,22,72,"And when Our enlightening verses are recited to the disbelievers, you can clearly see (the signs of) displeasure (and resentment) on their faces. It seems as if they are nearly ready to violently attack those who are reciting to them Our signs. Say: ‘(O restless disbelievers,) shall I inform you of something more agonizing than this? (That) is the Fire (of Hell), which Allah has promised to the disbelievers. And that is the most evil abode."
The Pilgrimage,22,73,"O mankind! An example is given, so listen to it attentively. Verily, the (idols) you worship besides Allah cannot create (even) a fly, though they all may join in for this (purpose). And if the fly snatches a thing away from them, they cannot (even) recover it from that (fly). How helpless is the seeker (worshipper) and the sought (false god)!"
The Pilgrimage,22,74,"These (disbelievers) did not recognize the value of Allah as was His due. Surely, Allah is Most Powerful, Most Dominant (over everything)."
The Pilgrimage,22,75,"Allah chooses His Messengers from amongst angels and from amongst men (as well). Surely, Allah is All-Hearing, All-Seeing."
The Pilgrimage,22,76,He knows (best) what is before them and what is behind them. And to Allah all matters are returned.
The Pilgrimage,22,77,"O believers! Persist in kneeling down and prostrating yourselves and worshipping your Lord, and do (other) pious deeds consistently so that you may prosper."
The Pilgrimage,22,78,"And strive hard in the way of Allah (for the establishment of peace and human dignity,) such a striving as is due to Him. He has chosen you, and has not laid upon you any hardship or constriction (in the matter of) Din (Religion). This is the Din (Religion) of your father Ibrahim (Abraham). He (Allah) has named you Muslims in the previous (Books) as well as in this (Holy Qur’an) so that this (final) Messenger may be a witness over you and you be witnesses over mankind. So, (to sustain this status) establish the Prayer, pay Zakat (the Alms-due) and hold fast to (the embrace of) Allah. He (alone) is your Helper (i.e., Patron). So what an excellent Patron and what an excellent Helper is He!"
The Believers,23,1,"Certainly, the believers have attained their goal,"
The Believers,23,2,"Those who become most humble and submissive in their Prayers,"
The Believers,23,3,"And who (always) keep away from absurd talk,"
The Believers,23,4,"And who (always) pay Zakat (the Alms-due [and keep purifying their wealth and souls]),"
The Believers,23,5,"And who guard their private parts (all the time),"
The Believers,23,6,"Except from their wives or those slave-girls who are the possessions of their hands. (If they go to them according to the Islamic injunctions,) there is surely no blame on them ."
The Believers,23,7,"But whoever desires someone beyond these (lawful women), it is they who are transgressors (and disobedient)."
The Believers,23,8,"And those who are watchful of their trusts and their pledges,"
The Believers,23,9,"And who guard their Prayers (with persistence),"
The Believers,23,10,It is they who will be the inheritors (of Paradise).
The Believers,23,11,"They will (also) inherit the most superior Gardens of Paradise (where all the bounties, comforts and pleasures of nearness to Allah will abound). They will live there forever."
The Believers,23,12,"And indeed, We originated (the genesis of) man from the extract of (chemical ingredients of) clay.*"
The Believers,23,13,Then We placed him as a sperm drop (zygote) in a secure place (the mother’s womb).
The Believers,23,14,"Then We made that zygote a hanging mass (clinging to the uterus like a leech). Then We developed that hanging mass into a lump, looking chewed with teeth. Out of this chewed lump, We built a structure of bones which We clothed with flesh (and muscles). Then (changing him) into another form, We developed him (gradually) into a new creation. Then Allah, the Best of creators, brought (him up into a strong body)."
The Believers,23,15,"Then certainly, after this (life), you shall die."
The Believers,23,16,"Then indeed, on the Day of Resurrection, you will be raised up (after brought to life)."
The Believers,23,17,"And surely, We have created above you seven paths (i.e., seven magnetic paths or fields, around the vast atmospheric expanse of the planet earth, for the safeguard of the cosmic system). And We were not unaware of the creation (of the universe and the pre-requisites of its security)."
The Believers,23,18,"And We showered water persistently (for a long time) from the clouds according to an estimated measure. So (when the earth became cool then) We lodged this water in (the depressions and depths of) the earth (shaping into preliminary forms of oceans). And verily, We have the power to make it evaporate (as vapours)."
The Believers,23,19,"Then by means of this We caused to grow for you (step by step firstly herbs, then plants and then trees and) the gardens of dates and grapes. (Furthermore, We created) for you many (other) fruits of which you eat (now)."
The Believers,23,20,"And (We have also created for you the olive) tree, which grows forth from Mount Sinai, (and) contains oil, and is a curry for those who eat."
The Believers,23,21,"And for you indeed there are (also) aspects to the cattle that need contemplation: We make you drink (milk We prepare from some ingredients) of what is in their bellies. And there are for you (also) many (other) benefits in them, and you eat (some) of them (as well)."
The Believers,23,22,And you are (also) borne upon them and on boats.
The Believers,23,23,"And surely, We sent Nuh (Noah) to his people. He said: ‘O people, always worship Allah. There is no God for you other than He. So do you not fear?’"
The Believers,23,24,"Then the chiefs (and the lords) of his people who disbelieved said: ‘This man is just a human being like you (nothing else). He seeks to establish (his) superiority and predominance over you. And if Allah wanted (to send some Messenger for guidance), He would send down angels. We have never heard of it from our ancestors (that a human being like us should be appointed as our Messenger)."
The Believers,23,25,"He is nothing but a man (afflicted) with madness. So wait for him, for a while (and keep an eye on what he does next).’"
The Believers,23,26,"Nuh (Noah) submitted: ‘O my Lord, help me because they have rejected me.’"
The Believers,23,27,"Then We revealed to him: ‘Build an Ark under Our supervision according to Our command. So when Our command (for torment) comes and the (water-filled) oven starts overflowing, load into it of every kind of animals two pairs each (male and female) and also your family, except that one amongst them about whom the command (of torment) has already been issued. And also do not supplicate Me concerning those who have wronged (by denying and mocking you). They shall (surely) be drowned."
The Believers,23,28,"So when you and the (people) accompanying you get settled in the Ark, then say: All praise be to Allah alone, Who has delivered us from the unjust people."
The Believers,23,29,"And submit: O my Lord, land me at a blessed destination, and You are the Best of all who bring to land.’"
The Believers,23,30,"Surely in this (event), there are (many) signs and We do certainly make trials."
The Believers,23,31,Then We raised after them another community.
The Believers,23,32,So We sent amongst them (also) a Messenger from amongst themselves: ‘Worship Allah. There is no God for you other than He. So do you not fear?’
The Believers,23,33,And thus proclaimed the chiefs (and the lords) of his people (too) who disbelieved and rejected the meeting of the Hereafter and whom We had (also) given prosperity (on account of abundant wealth) in the worldly life: ‘He is only a human being like you. He eats what you eat and drinks what you drink.
The Believers,23,34,"And if you obey a human being like yourselves, then you shall be the sure losers."
The Believers,23,35,"Does he promise you that, when you die and become dust and (decomposed) bones, you will be brought forth (alive again)?"
The Believers,23,36,"Far (from understanding), far (off from likelihood) are the things you are being promised."
The Believers,23,37,There is nothing (like life after death). Our life is only this world. We live and die (here alone) and (that is all). We shall not be raised up (again).
The Believers,23,38,"He is merely a man who has put a false blame on Allah, and we are not going to believe in him at all.’"
The Believers,23,39,"(The Prophet) submitted: ‘O my Lord, help me in the circumstances that they have rejected me.’"
The Believers,23,40,(Allah) said: ‘They will be full of regret in a little while.’
The Believers,23,41,"So, according to the true promise, the dreadful Blast seized them, and We made them a waste of withered grass. Far distant from, and deprived (of, Our mercy) are the unjust and wrongdoing people."
The Believers,23,42,Later We raised after them other communities (one after the other).
The Believers,23,43,"No community can step ahead of its appointed time, nor can it step back."
The Believers,23,44,"Then We sent Our Messengers one after the other. Whenever there came to a community their Messenger, they rejected him. Then We also destroyed them one after another (by successive torments) and We reduced them to mere tales. So woe to the people who do not believe!"
The Believers,23,45,"Then We sent Musa (Moses) and his brother Harun (Aaron) with Our signs and an evident authority,"
The Believers,23,46,To Pharaoh and the chiefs (of his people). They too behaved with arrogance and conceit. And they too were (extremely) wrongdoing and a disobedient people.
The Believers,23,47,So they (also) said (the same): ‘Shall we believe in two human beings like ourselves whilst their people worship us?’
The Believers,23,48,They (also) belied both of them. So they too became of those who were eliminated.
The Believers,23,49,"And indeed, We gave Musa (Moses) the Book so that they might take guidance."
The Believers,23,50,"And We made ‘Isa (Jesus), the son of Maryam (Mary), and his mother Our (great) sign. And We provided them a comfortable and facilitated abode on a pleasant, elevated ground fit for living with ease and comfort, and there was flowing water (i.e., streams, waterfalls and springs—a feast) for sight."
The Believers,23,51,"O (My Esteemed) Messengers! Eat of the pure things (as your practice is) and do good deeds with persistence. Surely, I am Well Aware of whatever (deed) you do."
The Believers,23,52,"And surely, this is your Umma ([Community] which is in fact) but one Umma (Community) and I am your Lord. Therefore, always fear Me."
The Believers,23,53,But they broke the command of their din (religion) into sects by disagreeing amongst themselves. Each sect is pleased with that much (portion of din [religion]) which they have.
The Believers,23,54,So leave them ditched in their ignorance and error for a time.
The Believers,23,55,"Do they think that the help We are giving them (in this world) in the shape of wealth and children,"
The Believers,23,56,(Implies that) We are hastening (the provision of) good things to them? (Nay!) The truth is that they have no awareness.
The Believers,23,57,"Indeed, those who remain restless and tremble with fear of their Lord,"
The Believers,23,58,"And those who believe in the Revelations of their Lord,"
The Believers,23,59,"And those who do not associate (any) partners with their Lord,"
The Believers,23,60,"And those who give away (in the way of Allah as much) as they can, yet (in spite of that) their hearts fear that they are to return to their Lord (lest it should be rejected),"
The Believers,23,61,"It is these people who are hastening in (collecting) good works, and it is they who excel in this pursuit."
The Believers,23,62,"And We do not strain any soul but commensurate with its capacity, and with Us is the record (of deeds) which will speak the truth, and they will not be wronged."
The Believers,23,63,"But their hearts are in (utter) negligence of this (message of the Qur’an) and (also) besides that, there are many other (evil) deeds which they are doing,"
The Believers,23,64,"Until when We seize the rich and the prosperous of them with torment, then they will cry out."
The Believers,23,65,"(It will be said to them:) ‘Do not cry today. Surely, you will not be helped by Us.’"
The Believers,23,66,"Certainly, My Verses were repeatedly recited to you but you used to turn back on your heels."
The Believers,23,67,"Displaying haughtiness and arrogance against it, you used to utter absurdity in the darkness of night."
The Believers,23,68,So have they not pondered over this command (of Allah)? Or has there come to them such a thing that did not come to their fathers?
The Believers,23,69,Or have they not recognized their Messenger and (so) they deny him?
The Believers,23,70,"Or do they say: ‘He (the Prophet) is (afflicted) with mania’? (Nay, not at all;) he has rather brought to them the truth, but most of them do not like the truth."
The Believers,23,71,"And had the (holy) truth (Allah) followed their vain desires, then (all) the heavens and the earth and whatever (living and non-living things) are therein, all would have been destroyed. We have rather brought them that (Qur’an) which contains (the secret of) their honour, dignity (and fame). So it is from their own honour that they are turning away."
The Believers,23,72,"Do you demand of them any recompense (for preaching the faith in Messengership? Nay, that too is not the case.) The recompense of your Lord itself is (by far) the best and He is the Best of all sustainers."
The Believers,23,73,"And surely, you call them to the straight path (for their own good)."
The Believers,23,74,"And surely, those who do not believe in the Hereafter remain deviated from the (straight) path."
The Believers,23,75,"And if We have mercy on them and remove the distress that has (afflicted) them, they will become hardened in their transgression, wandering disorientated."
The Believers,23,76,"And indeed, We seized them with torment, but (still) they did not adopt submissiveness to their Lord, nor did they entreat in humility (before His presence),"
The Believers,23,77,"Until when We open to them the gate of an extremely harsh torment, (then,) at that time, taken aback, they will (stay) therein, stunned in despair."
The Believers,23,78,"And He is the One Who (gradually) made for you ears and eyes and hearts (and minds), but you give very little thanks."
The Believers,23,79,"And He is the One Who created and then scattered you in the earth, and before Him will you be gathered."
The Believers,23,80,"And He is the One Who gives life and causes death, and in His control is (also) the alternation of night and day. So do you not understand?"
The Believers,23,81,But these people (too) utter similar words that the former (disbelievers) used to utter.
The Believers,23,82,"They say: ‘When we die and turn into dust and (decomposed) bones, then shall we be raised up (after given life again)?’"
The Believers,23,83,"Surely, this is what we and our fathers have (also) been promised. These (sayings) are but the tales of the bygone people."
The Believers,23,84,"Say (to them): ‘To whom belongs the earth and everyone (living) in it, if you know (anything)?’"
The Believers,23,85,They will promptly say: ‘(All) belongs to Allah.’ (Then) say: ‘Then why do you not accept guidance?’
The Believers,23,86,"Ask (them): ‘Who is the Lord of the seven heavens and the Mighty Throne (i.e., the Sovereign Authority of the entire universe)?’"
The Believers,23,87,They will spontaneously say: ‘(All) this belongs to Allah.’ Say: ‘Then why do you not fear?’
The Believers,23,88,"Say (to them): ‘Who is He in Whose Mighty Hand is the absolute ownership of everything and Who gives asylum, but against Whom no asylum can be given, if you know (anything)?’"
The Believers,23,89,"They will readily say: ‘That is all Allah’s (glory).’ So, say: ‘From where then are you being deceived (as if under a spell)?’"
The Believers,23,90,"The fact is that We have brought them the truth, and they are liars without any doubt."
The Believers,23,91,"Allah has not taken (to Himself) any son, nor is there any god with Him. In that case, each god would certainly have taken (away) what he had created, and they would surely have dominated each other (and the whole universe would have undergone violence and chaos). Glorified is Allah, above all that they describe."
The Believers,23,92,"(He) is the Knower of (all things) hidden and disclosed. So He is Exalted, High above all what they associate with Him."
The Believers,23,93,"Pray: ‘O my Lord, if You would show me that (torment) which they are being promised,"
The Believers,23,94,"(Then,) my Lord, put me not amongst the unjust people.’"
The Believers,23,95,And We certainly have the power to show you that (torment) of which We are making them a promise.
The Believers,23,96,Repel evil in such a way as is best of all. We know best (the things) they say.
The Believers,23,97,"And say, (praying): ‘O my Lord, I seek Your shelter from the promptings of the satans."
The Believers,23,98,"And, O my Lord, also I seek refuge with You lest they should come to me.’"
The Believers,23,99,"Until when death comes to any of them, (then) he will say: ‘O my Lord, send me back (to the world),"
The Believers,23,100,So that I may do some righteous works in that (world) which I have left behind.’ No way! He will be saying this (only in despair). And ahead of them is a barrier (erected) till the Day (when) they will be raised up (from the graves).
The Believers,23,101,"Then when the trumpet will be blown, neither will any relation remain (intact) amongst them that Day, nor will they be able to ask of one another."
The Believers,23,102,So they whose scales will weigh heavy (due to a great number of good deeds) will be successful and prosperous.
The Believers,23,103,"And the ones whose scales will be light (due to the little weight of good deeds), it is they who have harmed themselves. They are permanent residents of Hell."
The Believers,23,104,"The Fire will burn their faces, and they will be lying in it with teeth bulging out and mouths deformed."
The Believers,23,105,"(It will be said to them:) ‘Were My Revelations not repeatedly recited to you, and then you used to belie them?’"
The Believers,23,106,"They will say: ‘O our Lord, our misfortune overwhelmed us, and surely we were the misguided people."
The Believers,23,107,"O our Lord! Take us out from here. Then if we repeat (the same error), we shall certainly be the wrongdoers.’"
The Believers,23,108,(Allah will) say: ‘Stay on therein with disgrace and do not speak to Me.
The Believers,23,109,"Indeed, there was a party of My servants who used to submit (before My presence): O our Lord, we have believed, so forgive us and have mercy on us. And (surely) You are the Best of the merciful."
The Believers,23,110,But you used to laugh at them till they made you forget My remembrance and you (just) continued making fun of them.
The Believers,23,111,"This Day, I have bestowed upon them (this) reward for their patience that they have triumphed.’"
The Believers,23,112,(Allah) will say: ‘How many years have you stayed in the earth?’
The Believers,23,113,"They will say: ‘We might have stayed there a day or part of a day, but ask those who work out statistics.’"
The Believers,23,114,(Allah) will say: ‘You stayed there but very little. Would that you knew (it there)!’
The Believers,23,115,So did you think that We had created you in vain (without any purpose) and that you would not return to Us?
The Believers,23,116,"So Allah, the True Sovereign, is High and Exalted. There is no God but He. He alone is the Lord of the Venerated Throne (i.e., Authority)."
The Believers,23,117,"And anyone who worships another god along with Allah has no proof of this. So he will be accountable for that to his Lord alone. Surely, the disbelievers will not be successful."
The Believers,23,118,"And submit: ‘O my Lord, forgive and have mercy, and You (alone) are the Best of those who have mercy.’"
Light,24,1,This is a (great) Sura (chapter) which We have revealed and We have made its (commandments) obligatory. And We have sent down in it clear Revelations so that you may take direction and guidance.
Light,24,2,"Whip a hundred lashes each, the (unmarried) adulteress and the adulterer (on validation of adultery in accordance with the conditions of the statutory [hadd] punishment. If married, then both are to be stoned to death). And you should not feel even the slightest pity in Allah’s Din (Religion) for either of them (in executing the command), if you have faith in Allah and the Last Day. And a (sizeable) party of Muslims should be present on (the occasion of) award of punishment to both of them."
Light,24,3,"An adulterer does not (like to) marry (a chaste and virtuous woman) but only an adulteress or a polytheist, and no (pious man likes to) marry an adulteress (too) but only an adulterer or a polytheist. And this act (i.e., adultery) has been forbidden to the Muslims."
Light,24,4,"And those who accuse chaste women (of adultery), then fail to produce four witnesses, whip them eighty lashes (as qadhaf—the punishment for false accusation of adultery) and never accept their evidence. And it is they who are the evildoers,"
Light,24,5,"Except for those who repent after this (false blaming) and mend their ways. Then Allah is verily Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful. (They will not be counted amongst the disobedient, but this will not exempt them from hadd al-qadhaf [the penalty for false accusation of adultery].)"
Light,24,6,"And those who accuse their wives (of adultery) and have no witnesses except themselves, the testimony of such a person is to swear (himself) four times by Allah that he is truthful (in his accusation),"
Light,24,7,And the fifth time (to say) that Allah’s curse be upon him if he is a liar.
Light,24,8,"And (similarly) this can avert punishment from that (woman too) if she (herself) gives evidence, swearing four times by Allah that he (the husband) is a liar (in accusing her),"
Light,24,9,And the fifth time (to say) that Allah’s wrath be upon her if he (the husband) is truthful.
Light,24,10,"And had there not been Allah’s grace and mercy upon you, (then you would have been more perturbed under such circumstances) and Allah is surely Most Relenting, All-Wise."
Light,24,11,"Surely those who fabricated the accusation (against ‘A’isha the truthful, the pure, the chaste—may Allah be well pleased with her) were (also) a party from amongst you. Do not consider this (slander account) as a bad thing for you. It has rather (turned out to be) good for you.* Every one of them has a share in the sin as much as he has earned it, but whoever has had a major share in this (false accusation), for him is a terrible torment."
Light,24,12,"Why did it not happen that when you heard of it (the slander), the believers, both men and women, would think good of their own people and say: ‘This is obviously a fabricated accusation (based on falsehood)’?"
Light,24,13,"Why did these (slanderers) not produce four witnesses to this (turmoil)? Since they could not bring forth witnesses, it is certainly they who are liars in the sight of Allah."
Light,24,14,"And had there not been Allah’s grace upon you and His mercy in this world and in the Hereafter, severe torment would have afflicted you for promoting that (slander) into which you rushed headlong."
Light,24,15,"When (hearing this matter from one another) you brought it on your tongues, and uttered with your mouths something about which you (yourselves) had no knowledge, and you took (the propagation of) this matter as inconsiderable, whereas in the presence of Allah it was a grave (offence underway)."
Light,24,16,"And when you heard of this (heinous charge), why did you not declare (at the same moment): ‘It is not (at all justified) for us to talk about it’? (Rather you should have said: ‘O Allah,) Holy are You (High above making such a woman the beloved wife of Your Beloved and Esteemed Messenger [blessings and peace be upon him]). This is a grave charge.’"
Light,24,17,Allah admonishes you to never repeat such a thing (in your lifetime) if you are believers.
Light,24,18,"And Allah explains to you the Revelations with utmost clarity. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise."
Light,24,19,"Indeed, those who like that lewdness should spread amongst the Muslims, for them is an agonizing punishment in this world and in the Hereafter. And Allah knows (the intentions of such people) and you do not know."
Light,24,20,"And had there not been Allah’s grace and His mercy upon you (for the sake of the Holy Prophet [blessings and peace be upon him], you too would have been destroyed like the former communities). But Allah is Most Clement, Ever-Merciful."
Light,24,21,"O believers! Do not follow the footsteps of Satan, and whoever follows the footsteps of Satan, then he (Satan) certainly commands to practise (and promotes) immorality and sinful deeds. And if there had not been Allah’s grace and His mercy upon you, then none of you would ever have been pure (of the stain of the sin of slander). But Allah purifies whom He wills and Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing."
Light,24,22,"And (now) those of you who are exalted (by way of the Din [Religion]) and are affluent (worldwise) must not swear that they will not provide (financial help) to the relatives, the needy and the Emigrants (who were involved in this offence of false accusation). They should forgive (their misconduct) and overlook (their mistake). Do you not like that Allah should forgive you? And Allah is Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful."
Light,24,23,"Verily, those who falsely accuse chaste, believing women who are unaware of, and unacquainted (with, even the very idea of indecency and evil) are cursed in this world and in the Hereafter. And for them is woeful punishment,"
Light,24,24,"On the Day when their (own) tongues and their hands and their feet will bear witness against them for whatever they used to do,"
Light,24,25,"On that Day, Allah will pay them full recompense that they truly deserve (for their deeds). And they will come to know that Allah is (Himself) the truth (and also) the Revealer (of the truth)."
Light,24,26,"Unclean women are (particular) for unclean men, while unclean men are meant for unclean women. And, (likewise,) clean and chaste women are (specific) to clean and pious men, whilst clean and pious men are exclusively for clean and chaste women. (So keeping in view the holiness, sanctity and purity of the Holy Prophet, you yourselves could imagine how pure, wholesome and chaste a wife Allah would have raised for him.) These (pure, innocent and pious people) are totally free from these (slanders), which these (foul-mouthed) people are levelling. Forgiveness and bestowal of honour and dignity have been (destined) for them. (Why do you ruin your life after death and earn disgrace and humiliation by denigrating his glory?)"
Light,24,27,O believers! Do not enter houses other than your own until you obtain their permission. And greet their residents (immediately after you enter). This (advice) is better for you so that you may contemplate (its rationale).
Light,24,28,"Then, if you do not find anyone in these (houses), do not enter them until you are granted permission (for that). And if it is said to you: ‘Go back,’ then do go back. That is purer for you, and Allah is Well Aware of what you do."
Light,24,29,"There is no sin on you if you enter (without permission) those houses (or buildings) which are not permanent residences (such as hotels, road-houses and inns). You have the right to get benefit therein. And Allah knows (all) that you disclose and that you conceal."
Light,24,30,"Direct the believing men to keep their eyes always lowered and guard their private parts. That is purer for them. Surely, Allah is Well Aware of the (works) which they are busy doing."
Light,24,31,"And direct the believing women that they (too) must keep their eyes lowered and guard their chastity, and must not show off their adornments and beautification except that (part of it) which becomes visible itself. And they must keep their veils (and head-coverings) drawn over their chests (too), and must not display their adornments (to anyone) except their husbands, or their fathers or the fathers of their husbands, or their sons or the sons of their husbands, or their brothers or the sons of their brothers or the sons of their sisters, or (the women of) their (own faith, the Muslim) women or their female slaves or such male servants as are free from any lust and sexual urge, or the children who (being minor) have (yet) no sense of women’s private parts. (They too are exceptions.) Nor must they (whilst walking) strike their feet (on the ground in such a manner that ornaments jingle and) thus get revealed and known what they are keeping hidden (under the command of Shariah). And turn to Allah, all of you, in repentance, O believers, so that you may prosper (by implementing these commandments)."
Light,24,32,"And marry those of your men and women who are leading an unmarried life (despite reaching the age of marriage), and also (marry) those of your male and female slaves who are capable. If they are poor, Allah will make them rich out of His bounty and Allah is Most Infinite, All-Knowing."
Light,24,33,"And those who cannot afford marriage (for lack of financial means) should adopt chastity until Allah enriches them out of His bounty. And from amongst (the male and female slaves) under your control, those who seek to write out a deed (of manumission—freedom through earning and paying,) write it for them, and free them (under the given condition) if you see any good in them. Pay them (also yourselves) out of that wealth which Allah has given you (to help them get freedom). And do not force your maids into prostitution to obtain benefit of the worldly life if they desire to keep themselves chaste (or wish to safeguard their chastity through marriage). And whoever will compel them, then (even) after they are compelled, Allah is Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful."
Light,24,34,"And surely, We have sent down to you evident and enlightening Revelations and some examples of those who have passed away before you (i.e., like ‘A’isha’s story, the story of Maryam [Mary] and the story of Yusuf [Joseph]). And (this) is for the direction and guidance of the Godfearing."
Light,24,35,"Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The likeness of His Light (which is glowing in the world in the form of Muhammad’s Light [blessings and peace be upon him]) is as a niche-like (sacred breast) wherein is glowing the lamp (of Prophethood), the lamp contained in a crystal globe (the radiant heart of the Prophet Muhammad [blessings and peace be upon him]). This globe is (as dazzlingly bright owing to reflection of Allah’s Light) as a glittering star. (This lamp of Prophethood) is lit with the sacred olive tree (i.e., either due to the blissful communication of divine Revelation from the Realm of divinity, or owing to the blissful genealogical tree of the Prophets and the Messengers). It is neither (merely) eastern nor western (rather universal and cosmic in its generously infinite luminosity. The likeness of this lamp of Prophethood is as if) its oil (i.e., Light, due to its genuine and inherent potential capability) is glowing, though no fire (or the radiation of celestial miracles and divine Revelation) has even touched it yet. (So it) is Light upon Light (i.e., the Light of Prophethood upon the Light of the Holy Essence, denoting a Self-Embodying double Light). Allah takes to (the gnosis of) His Light whom He wills. And Allah explains similitudes for (the guidance of) people and Allah is Well Aware of everything."
Light,24,36,"(This Light of Allah illumines) such houses (mosques and centres) as Allah has ordained to exalt (i.e., enhance their esteem and honour) and remember His Name therein. (These are the houses) in which (Allah’s servants) glorify Him morning and evening."
Light,24,37,"(Blessed with this Light) are those servants of (Allah) whom neither trade nor sale diverts from the remembrance of Allah and from establishing Prayer and paying Zakat (the Alms-due. Even whilst performing their worldly duties) they keep fearing the Day when hearts and eyes will (all) overturn (with terror),"
Light,24,38,"So that Allah gives them the best reward for the (good) deeds they have done, and bestows upon them (still) more out of His bounty. And Allah blesses with sustenance (and provisions) without measure whom He wills."
Light,24,39,"And the deeds of the disbelievers are like a mirage in a vast barren field which the thirsty one deems to be water, until when he gets near it he finds it to be nothing. (Likewise, in the Hereafter) he will find Allah near him, but Allah fully paid him back (in the world). And Allah is Swift in taking account."
Light,24,40,"Or (the disbelievers’ deeds are like) the darkness in a deep sea covered by a wave, rolled upon (yet) by another wave and above that are clouds. (This) darkness is (in layers) one over another. When (a person drowning into such a sea) stretches his hand out, no one can see it. And he for whom Allah has not formed any light (of guidance), for him there is no light (anywhere)."
Light,24,41,"Have you not seen that (all) who are in the heavens and the earth glorify Allah alone, and the birds (too in the air around) with wings outspread (do celebrate His praise)? Each one knows his own mode of prayer and praise (before the presence of Allah). And Allah is Well Aware of the deeds they accomplish."
Light,24,42,And to Allah alone belongs the sovereignty of all the heavens and the earth and to Him will all return.
Light,24,43,"Have you not seen that Allah is the One Who drives the cloud (first) gently, then joins its (various pieces) together, and then forms them into layers upon layers? Then you see that from spaces between them rain issues forth and falls down. And He sends down hail from the clouds (looking) like snow-covered mountains in the same sky (i.e., atmosphere). And then He throws it down upon whom He wills and turns it away from whom He likes. (Moreover, He creates lightning from the same clouds.) It seems as if the flash of the lightning (of clouds) would (dazzle their eyes and) snatch their sight away."
Light,24,44,"(And) Allah turns about the night and the day (over each other). Surely, there is (great) guidance in it for those who have reason and insight."
Light,24,45,"And Allah has originated (the chemical genesis of) every moving creature from water. So, some of them creep on their bellies, some walk on two feet and some others on four. Allah creates what He wills. Surely, Allah has absolute power over everything."
Light,24,46,We have indeed sent down clear and enlightening Revelations (through which) Allah guides whom He wills to the straight path.
Light,24,47,"And they say: ‘We have believed in Allah and the Messenger and we obey.’ Then, after (saying) this, a group of them turn away (from their affirmation). And (in fact) these people are not (at all) believers."
Light,24,48,"And when they are called to Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) that he may judge between them, a party of them turn away (from appearing before the Messenger [blessings and peace be upon him])."
Light,24,49,"And had they been in the right, they would have come fast to him (the Messenger [blessings and peace be upon him]) most submissively."
Light,24,50,"Is there a disease (of hypocrisy) in their hearts? Or do they doubt (the majesty and glory of the Messenger)? Or do they fear that Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) will do them wrong? (Nay,) they themselves are the wrongdoers."
Light,24,51,"The only saying of the believers, when they are called to Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) in order that he may judge between them, is that they say: ‘We have heard and we (totally) submit to obey.’ It is they who will prosper."
Light,24,52,"And whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) and fears Allah and adopts Godwariness for Him, it is they who will achieve their goal."
Light,24,53,"And they swear most strongly (and solemnly) by Allah that if you order them, they will certainly set out (for jihad [the sacred struggle for the establishment of peace and human rights]). Say: ‘Do not swear. It is obedience that is (required) as per law. Allah is certainly Well Aware of the deeds you do.’"
Light,24,54,"Say: ‘Obey Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him), but if you turn away (from obedience), then (beware that) the Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) is simply responsible for the duty he is charged with, and you are responsible for what you are charged with. And if you obey him, you will be guided. And nothing is (obligatory) for the Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) but to convey (the commands) clearly.’"
Light,24,55,"To those of you who believe and keep doing pious deeds Allah has given the promise (whose fulfilment and implementation is obligatory for the Umma [Community]): He will surely bestow upon them khilafa (the trust of right to rule) as He granted (the right to) rule to those who were before them. And (through dominance and rule) He will strengthen and stabilize their Din (Religion) for them which He has liked for them, and (by this strength and rule) He will for sure change their former state of fear (which was due to their political, economic and social handicap) to that of peace and security. They will worship Me (fearlessly and) will not associate any partner with Me (i.e., will follow and obey only My command and system). And after this, whoever adopts ingratitude (i.e., aversion to, and denial of, My commands) it is they who will be defiant (and disobedient)."
Light,24,56,"And establish (the system of) prayers and (ensure) the payment of Zakat (the Alms-due) and accomplish (absolute) obedience to the Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) so that you may be granted mercy (i.e., the blessings of sovereign rule, stability, peace and security may endure and continue)."
Light,24,57,And let it not occur to you at all that those who disbelieve and are ungrateful will make (Allah) powerless (to destroy them) in the earth. And Hell is their abode and the worst is that abode.
Light,24,58,"O believers! Your (male and female) slaves and your children who have not yet attained puberty must seek your permission (to come to you) on three occasions: (first) before the Fajr (Dawn) Prayer, (second) when you put off your clothes at noon (for rest), and (third) after the ‘Isha’ (Night) Prayer (when you go to bed for sleep. These are) the three (times) of privacy for you. Other than these (times), there is no sin on you or them (because during remaining hours they) keep coming and going frequently where you are from one to the other. That is how Allah makes the Revelations clear for you, and Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise."
Light,24,59,"And when the children from amongst you reach puberty, they must also seek your permission (to come to you) as (other elders) have been doing before them. That is how Allah makes His commands clear for you. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise."
Light,24,60,"And there is no sin on those elderly house-confined women who have no desire (now) for marriage if they lay aside their garments (i.e., additional outer coverings), provided they (too) do not show their adornment. And if they are (more) committed to self-restraint (i.e., do not remove additional outer coverings as well), that is better for them. And Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing."
Light,24,61,"There is no restriction on the blind, nor any blame on the lame, nor is there any sin on the sick, nor (any harm) for you if you eat (food) from your own houses or from the houses of your fathers, or the houses of your mothers, or the houses of your brothers, or the houses of your sisters, or the houses of your fathers’ brothers, or the houses of your fathers’ sisters, or the houses of your mothers’ brothers, or the houses of your mothers’ sisters, or the houses whose keys are in your charge (i.e., whose owners have permitted you for any use. Nor is there any harm to eat food) from your friends’ houses. There is no sin on you whether you all eat together or separately. Then, when you enter the houses, greet (the members of) your (family) with the greeting of peace and security. (This) is a blissful and pure greeting from Allah. Thus Allah makes clear His Verses for you so that you may understand (the commands of the Shariah and the manners of life)."
Light,24,62,"The believers are only those who have believed in Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him), and when they are with you for some (collective) issue which brings (the people) together, then they should not go away from there (i.e., they should participate whole-heartedly to work for collective coherence and unity amongst the Umma [Community]) until they have obtained permission from you (owing to some special excuse. O Esteemed Prophet,) surely those who seek permission from you (believing your Majesty the Supreme and Ultimate Authority), it is they who are the believers in Allah and His Prophet. So when they seek from you permission (to go) for some affair of theirs, then (you are the Supreme Sovereign Authority). Grant leave whom you please, and ask forgiveness for them from Allah (even on going away from your company by obtaining your permission, lest they should be seized even on that). Surely, Allah is Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful."
Light,24,63,"(O Muslims!) Do not regard the calling of the Prophet amongst you like your calling of one another. (When calling the Holy Prophet is not like your mutual calling amongst you, then how can the Holy Personality of the Prophet be like yours?) Surely, Allah knows those from amongst you (well) who slip away quietly (from the presence of the Holy Prophet [blessings and peace be upon him]) under the shelter of one another. So let those who go against the Messenger’s command (of veneration and devotion) feel afraid lest some trial should overtake them (here in the world) or a painful torment seize them in the Hereafter."
Light,24,64,"Beware! To Allah belongs (all) that is in the heavens and in the earth. He certainly knows your state of mind (i.e., state of belief or that of hypocrisy). And on the Day when they will be returned to Him, He will disclose to them what they used to do and Allah knows everything full well."
The Criterion,25,1,Blessed is He (Allah) Who sent down to His (most beloved and most intimate) servant the Criterion (the Qur’an) that (draws the difference between right and wrong and) gives judgment in order that he may be a Warner to all the worlds;
The Criterion,25,2,"He (Allah) to Whom belongs the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth, and Who has not taken (to Himself) any children, nor has He any partner in His Kingdom and He alone has created everything, and then destined (i.e., formatted) it exactly according to a definite estimation (its features, functions, time frame and everything for all the stages of its growth and survival)."
The Criterion,25,3,"And these (polytheists) have taken besides Him other gods which cannot create anything and are themselves created and possess no power either to harm or to benefit themselves and control neither death nor life, nor (have they any authority) to raise up (after death) and assemble."
The Criterion,25,4,"And the disbelievers say: ‘This (Qur’an) is but a lie which this (claimant of Prophethood) has fabricated and other people have helped him in (inventing) it.’ Surely, the disbelievers have come down to sheer injustice and falsehood."
The Criterion,25,5,And they say: ‘(This Qur’an comprises) fables of the ancients which this man has got written; then these (fables) are recited to him morning and evening (in order to memorize and narrate further).’
The Criterion,25,6,"Say: ‘He (Allah) Who knows all the secrets (present) in the heavens and the earth has sent down this Qur’an. Surely, He is Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful.’"
The Criterion,25,7,And they say: ‘What is the matter with this Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him)? He eats food and walks about in the marketplaces. Why has an angel not been sent down to him that he might (join) him as a Warner?
The Criterion,25,8,"Or a treasure should have been sent down to him, or (at least) he should have owned a garden so that he might eat (of its income).’ And the wrongdoers say (to the Muslims): ‘You are following but a man spellbound.’"
The Criterion,25,9,(O Esteemed Beloved!) Just see what sort of comparisons they utter for you! So they have gone astray and cannot find any path (to guidance).
The Criterion,25,10,"Most Blessed is He. If He pleases, He can produce gardens for you (far) better than these (here in the world) beneath which streams flow, and raise for you magnificent palaces (but these are not the conditions for a Prophet and Messenger)."
The Criterion,25,11,"But they have denied the Last Hour (as well), and for everyone who denies the Last Hour, We have prepared the blazing Fire (of Hell)."
The Criterion,25,12,"When that (Fire of Hell) will be visible to them (even) from a distant place, they will hear it raging and roaring."
The Criterion,25,13,"And when, tightly bound (together or bound to their satans,) they will be thrown into it from some narrow place, then they will cry out for (their) destruction."
The Criterion,25,14,(It will be said to them:) ‘Do not call out (just) for one destruction Today but call for many more destructions.’
The Criterion,25,15,"Say: ‘Is this (a) better (state), or the (life of) eternal Paradise promised to the Godfearing? This is their reward (of deeds) and their abode."
The Criterion,25,16,(All) that they long for will be (available) for them in these (Gardens of Paradise). They will live (in it) for ever. That is a coveted promise which your Lord has made a (bountiful) obligation upon Himself (and which will surely be fulfilled).’
The Criterion,25,17,"And on that Day, Allah will assemble them together with those they worshipped besides Allah. He will then say: ‘Was it you who led these My servants astray, or did they (themselves) go astray from the path?’"
The Criterion,25,18,"They will say: ‘Glory be to You. It did not become us (even) to take friends other than You (let alone asking them to worship others besides You). But, (O Lord,) You bestowed upon them and their fathers worldly riches to such an extent that they forgot (even) Your remembrance. And these were but the (doomed) people to be destroyed.’"
The Criterion,25,19,"(O disbelievers!) They have denied what you said. So, (now) you can neither avert the torment nor help yourselves. And, (listen,) whoever of you does injustice, We shall make him taste a mighty torment."
The Criterion,25,20,And We did not send Messengers before you but (that) they certainly ate food and also walked about in the marketplaces (as needed). And We have made you a trial for one another. Will you observe patience (in trial)? And your Lord is All-Seeing.
The Criterion,25,21,"And those who do not hope for meeting with Us say: ‘Why were angels not sent down to us? Or if we could see our Lord (with our own eyes, we would certainly believe).’ In fact, they esteem (themselves) very highly in their hearts and are rebelling beyond bounds."
The Criterion,25,22,"The Day when they will see the angels, there will be no matter of joy for the evildoers anyway on that Day. They will rather say (frightened on seeing them): ‘Would that there were a barricade (which could save us from them! Or the angels, on seeing them, will say: Entry to Paradise is totally forbidden for you.)’"
The Criterion,25,23,And (then) We shall turn to the deeds they (presumably) did (in life) and shall make them scattered dust particles.
The Criterion,25,24,"On that Day, the lodging for the inmates of Paradise will be the best, and their resting place (too) will be excellent (where they will retire for a nap after the reckoning noon)."
The Criterion,25,25,"And that Day, the sky will be rent asunder, changed into (the resemblance of smoke, like) a cloud, and the angels will be sent down rank upon rank."
The Criterion,25,26,"That Day, true sovereignty will belong to the Most Kind (Lord) and that will be very hard (i.e., tough) Day on the disbelievers."
The Criterion,25,27,"And that Day, every wrongdoer will bite his hands (in fury and frustration and) will say: ‘Would that I had taken the path (of guidance by joining) the companionship of the Holy Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him)!"
The Criterion,25,28,Ah! Woe to me! Would that I had not taken such a one for a friend!
The Criterion,25,29,"Surely, he led me astray from the direction and guidance after it had come to me, and Satan leaves man helpless and forlorn (in the time of distress)."
The Criterion,25,30,"And the (Holy) Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) will submit: ‘O Lord, surely my people had utterly abandoned this Qur’an.’"
The Criterion,25,31,"And that is how We made for every Prophet (their) enemy from the evildoers (who used to oppose their Prophetic mission, and this way, a conflict between the forces of good and evil would develop and a favourable and congenial environment for peaceful change would take shape against tyranny, oppression and injustice). And your Lord is sufficient to guide and help."
The Criterion,25,32,"And the disbelievers say: ‘Why has the Qur’an not been (put together and) sent down to this (Prophet) in one go?’ It has been revealed gradually (in segments) so that by this We may strengthen your (most sanctified) heart, and (that is why) We have recited it gradually with pauses (in order that your heart may feel tranquil by receiving Our message again and again)."
The Criterion,25,33,"And these (disbelievers) do not bring you any (such) instance (as an objection or inquiry), but We provide you with the truth (to reply it) and an explanation better (than that)."
The Criterion,25,34,(They) are such people as will be driven headlong towards Hell. It is they who are the worst ones as for their abode and are (also) much distracted from the (straight) path.
The Criterion,25,35,"And surely, We gave Musa (Moses) the Book, and appointed his brother Harun (Aaron) with him as his minister (for his help)."
The Criterion,25,36,"Then We said: ‘Go, both of you, to the people who have rejected Our signs.’ (But when, despite that, they did not abstain from belying Us) We totally destroyed them."
The Criterion,25,37,"And the people of Nuh ([Noah] as well), when they denied the Prophets, We drowned them and made them a sign of warning for (other) people. And We have prepared a painful torment for the wrongdoers."
The Criterion,25,38,And (We also annihilated) ‘?d and Thamud and the residents of Rass and many (other) people in between.
The Criterion,25,39,"And We explained examples to each one (of them for direction and guidance,) but (when they did not refrain from rebellion,) We wiped them off completely."
The Criterion,25,40,And certainly these (disbelievers) have passed by (the remains of) that town on which was showered a disastrous rain (of stones). Did they not see that (ruined town)? But the truth is that they do not expect to be raised up (after death).
The Criterion,25,41,"And, (O Esteemed Beloved,) when they see you, they do nothing but make fun of you (and say:) ‘Is this (the one) Allah has sent as a Messenger?"
The Criterion,25,42,"He had nearly turned us away from our gods, had we not held fast to their (worship).’ And when they see the torment, they will soon realize who was astray."
The Criterion,25,43,Have you seen him who has taken the desire of his lower self as god? Would you then become a guardian over him?
The Criterion,25,44,"Do you think that most of them hear or understand? (Nay,) they have become like cattle, rather worse in error than they are."
The Criterion,25,45,"Have you not had a glance of (the Might of) your Lord, how He lengthens the shadow (till noon)? And had He willed, He could certainly have made it stationary. Then We have made the sun a proof of this (shadow)."
The Criterion,25,46,"Then, drawing this (shadow) little by little towards Ourselves, We roll it up."
The Criterion,25,47,And He is the One Who has made the night a (wrapper-like) covering for you and made sleep (a means of) rest (for you) and the day a time to get up (for work).
The Criterion,25,48,"And He is the One Who sends the breezes as good news before (the rain of) His mercy. And it is We Who send down pure (and cleansing) water from the sky,"
The Criterion,25,49,"So that We may give life with that to (any) dead city, and (furthermore) We provide this (water) for drink to many cattle and (nomadic) people that We have created."
The Criterion,25,50,"And surely, We keep distributing this (rain) amongst them (on the scale of different times and cities) so that they may contemplate. Even then most people did not accept (anything) except ingratitude."
The Criterion,25,51,"And had We willed, We would have sent a Warner in every town."
The Criterion,25,52,"So, (O man of faith,) do not follow the disbelievers, and launch a large-scale struggle against them by means of (logic and preaching of the Qur’an)."
The Criterion,25,53,"And He is the One Who joined two rivers, this (one) very sweet and freshening and that (other one) very salty and bitter. And He set a barrier and a strong partition between them."
The Criterion,25,54,"And He is the One Who created man from (a sperm drop resembling) water, and made for him (kinship by) lineage and in-laws. And your Lord is All-Powerful."
The Criterion,25,55,"And they (disbelievers) worship besides Allah those (idols) that can neither bring them any profit, nor do them any harm. And the disbeliever is (always) a helper (of Satan) in (disobeying) his Lord."
The Criterion,25,56,And We have not sent you but as a Bearer of good news (for the obedient servants of Allah) and as a Warner (to the rebels).
The Criterion,25,57,"Say: ‘I do not ask you for any compensation for this (preaching), but that whoever desires to take a path to (reach) his Lord (may step in).’"
The Criterion,25,58,"And put your trust in the Ever-Living (Lord) Who will never die, and glorify Him with His praise, and Sufficient is His awareness of the sins of His servants,"
The Criterion,25,59,He Who created the heavenly spheres and the earth and this (universe) in between in six periods.* Then He established (His authority) on the Throne (befitting His Majesty. He) is Most Kind. (O aspirant to His gnosis!) Ask of Him someone who has attained to His awareness. (The unaware do not have any gnosis of Him.)
The Criterion,25,60,"And when it is said to them: ‘Prostrate yourselves before the Most Kind (Lord),’ the (deniers of the truth) say: ‘What is the Most Kind Lord? Shall we prostrate ourselves before whatever you command us?’ And this (command) increased only hatred in them."
The Criterion,25,61,Most Blessed and Most Glorified is He Who made vast mansions of heavenly spheres (in the form of galaxies) in the heavenly cosmos and made (the sun) in it a (light-generating and heat-emitting) lamp and a shining moon (in the solar system).
The Criterion,25,62,And He is the One Who made the day and the night rotate after each other for him who desires to contemplate or intends to be grateful. (There is direction and guidance in these creative powers.)
The Criterion,25,63,"And the (favourite) servants of the Most Kind (Lord) are those who walk gently on the earth, and when the ignorant (i.e., impolite) people say to them something (unlikable), they (get aside), saying: ‘Peace.’"
The Criterion,25,64,And (these) are the ones who spend their nights prostrating themselves and standing before their Lord (cloaked in submissiveness).
The Criterion,25,65,"And (these) are the people who pray (all the time before the presence of Allah): ‘O our Lord, turn away from us the torment of Hell. Surely, its torment is most injurious (and everlasting)."
The Criterion,25,66,"Surely, that is an evil lodging (for temporary lodgers) and an evil abode (for permanent dwellers).’"
The Criterion,25,67,And (these) are the people who are neither extravagant nor miserly when they spend. And their spending is (based on) a balance between the two extremes (of extravagance and miserliness).
The Criterion,25,68,"And these are the people who do not worship any other god apart from Allah, nor do they kill the soul whose killing without any lawful cause Allah has forbidden, nor do they commit adultery. And whoever does this will receive the punishment due for the sin."
The Criterion,25,69,"His punishment will be doubled on the Day of Rising and, disgraced and humiliated, he will live in it forever."
The Criterion,25,70,"But whoever repents and believes and does good deeds, so these are the people whose evil deeds Allah will change into good ones. And Allah is Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful."
The Criterion,25,71,"And whoever repents and executes good, so he returns to Allah (the way) returning is due."
The Criterion,25,72,"And these are the people who do not attend (both verbally and practically) the false and untruthful matters, and when they pass by evil activities, they pass on (observing caution) with utmost nobility and dignity."
The Criterion,25,73,"And these are the people who, when they are directed and guided by means of Revelations of their Lord, do not fall at them deaf and blind (but reflect on them)."
The Criterion,25,74,"And these are the people who submit (before the presence of Allah): ‘O our Lord, grant us coolness of eyes in our wives and our children, and make us leaders of the Godfearing people.’"
The Criterion,25,75,They will be rewarded with lofty palaces (in Paradise) as recompense for their patience and steadfastness and will be welcomed therein with greetings and salutations of peace.
The Criterion,25,76,They will live therein forever. Those (lofty palaces in Paradise) are the most excellent lodgings and (decent) abodes.
The Criterion,25,77,Say: ‘My Lord cares little for you if you do not worship (Him). But you have indeed rejected (Him). So now this (denial) will ever endure as a permanent torment (for you).’
The Poets,26,1,"Ta, Sin, Mim. (Only Allah and the Messenger [blessings and peace be upon him] know the real meaning.)"
The Poets,26,2,These are the Verses of the Book that makes clear (the truth).
The Poets,26,3,"(O Esteemed Beloved!) You will perhaps risk your (dearest) life, (grieving) that they do not accept faith."
The Poets,26,4,"If We intend, We should send down upon them (such) a sign from heaven as their necks would not but bow down before it."
The Poets,26,5,And there does not come to them any new admonition from the Most Kind (Lord) but they turn away from it.
The Poets,26,6,"Thus they have indeed denied (the truth), so the news of what they used to make fun of will reach them soon."
The Poets,26,7,And have they not discerned the earth—what a variety of excellent vegetation We have caused to grow in it?
The Poets,26,8,"Surely, there is a sign in it (of Allah’s might), but most of them are not the ones to believe."
The Poets,26,9,"And assuredly, your Lord alone is the Almighty, Ever-Merciful."
The Poets,26,10,And (recall) when your Lord called to Musa (Moses): ‘Go to the wrongdoing people;
The Poets,26,11,(That is) the people of Pharaoh. Do they not fear (Allah)?’
The Poets,26,12,"Musa (Moses) submitted: ‘O my Lord, I fear that they will reject me."
The Poets,26,13,"And my breast constricts (under such adverse circumstances) and my tongue does not express (fluently), so send (Gabriel with revelation) to Harun ([Aaron] as well so that he becomes my helper)."
The Poets,26,14,"And they also have a charge against me (of killing a Copt), so I fear they may kill me.’"
The Poets,26,15,"(Allah) said: ‘By no means, so go both of you, with Our signs. Surely, We are with you, hearing (everything)."
The Poets,26,16,"So go, both of you, to Pharaoh and say: We are the Messengers (sent) by the Lord of all the worlds."
The Poets,26,17,(Our aim is that) you send the Children of Israel with us (setting them free).’
The Poets,26,18,"Pharaoh said: ‘Did we not bring you up amongst us as a child, and you spent many years of your life with us?’"
The Poets,26,19,"And (then) you committed that deed which you committed (i.e., you killed a Copt), and you are one of the ungrateful (you have forgotten our guardianship and favours)."
The Poets,26,20,"(Musa [Moses]) said: ‘When I did that deed, I was unaware (that even a single blow would take his life)."
The Poets,26,21,"So (at that time), I went out of your (line of control) when I feared your (designs). Then my Lord bestowed on me the commandment (of Prophethood) and (finally) made me one of the Messengers."
The Poets,26,22,And is that (any) favour of which you are reminding me? (That happened also because) you had enslaved (all my people) the Children of Israel.’
The Poets,26,23,(Pharaoh) said: ‘What is the Lord of all the worlds?’
The Poets,26,24,(Musa [Moses]) said: ‘(He) is the Lord of all the heavens and the earth and the (whole universe) between the two if you are a firm believer.’
The Poets,26,25,He said to those seated around him: ‘Are you not listening?’
The Poets,26,26,(Musa [Moses]) added: ‘(The One Who) is your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers (too).’
The Poets,26,27,"(Pharaoh) said: ‘Surely, your Messenger that has been sent to you is but insane.’"
The Poets,26,28,"(Musa [Moses]) said: ‘(He) is the Lord of the east and the west, and (the whole universe) between the two if you have (some) sense.’"
The Poets,26,29,"(Pharaoh) said: ‘(O Musa [Moses,]) if you take a god other than me, I will certainly (arrest and) put you amongst the prisoners.’"
The Poets,26,30,(Musa [Moses]) said: ‘Even if I bring you something manifest (also as a miracle)?’
The Poets,26,31,(Pharaoh) said: ‘Bring it if you are truthful.’
The Poets,26,32,"So Musa (Moses) put his staff down (on the ground) and that, at once, became a serpent, evidently clear."
The Poets,26,33,And (Musa [Moses]) brought out his hand (after putting it under his armpit) and there it became radiant white to the viewers.
The Poets,26,34,"(Pharaoh) said to the chiefs (sitting) around him: ‘Undoubtedly, he is a (highly) learned sorcerer."
The Poets,26,35,He seeks to drive you out of your land by (the force of) his magic. So what is your opinion (about him now)?’
The Poets,26,36,They said: ‘Put off (the announcement of sentence for) him and his brother (Harun [Aaron]) and send callers to (all) the cities (to summon the sorcerers).
The Poets,26,37,"They will bring you every high ranking, expert sorcerer.’"
The Poets,26,38,So all the sorcerers were assembled at the appointed time on the fixed day.
The Poets,26,39,"And it was said to the people (from Pharaoh’s side): ‘You will assemble together (on this occasion),"
The Poets,26,40,So that we may follow (the din [religion] of) the sorcerers if they overmaster (Musa [Moses] and Harun [Aaron]).’
The Poets,26,41,"Then when the sorcerers arrived, they said to Pharaoh: ‘Is there (also) any reward (fixed) for us if we gain the upper hand (in the contest)?’"
The Poets,26,42,"(Pharaoh) said: ‘Yes indeed! (Instead of the rewarded ones,) you will straight away join (my) closer circle (and intimate relationship is far higher in grade than reward).’"
The Poets,26,43,( Musa [ Moses]) said to those (sorcerers): ‘Throw down the (magic) items which you are about to throw.’
The Poets,26,44,"So they cast down their strings and sticks and said: ‘By the honour of Pharaoh, we shall certainly win.’"
The Poets,26,45,"Then Musa (Moses) cast down his staff which, (changing into a serpent,) began swallowing up those things which they had made look different (from reality) through trickery."
The Poets,26,46,"So, all the magicians fell down prostrating themselves."
The Poets,26,47,"They said: ‘We believe in the Lord of all the worlds,"
The Poets,26,48,The Lord of Musa (Moses) and Harun (Aaron).’
The Poets,26,49,"(Pharaoh) said: ‘You have believed in Him before I granted you permission. Surely, it is he (Musa [Moses]) who is your chief (coach) and who has taught you magic. You will soon come to know (your end). I will definitely cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides and will surely crucify you all.’"
The Poets,26,50,"They said: ‘There is no harm (in it). Surely, we are to return to our Lord."
The Poets,26,51,We have strong hope that our Lord will forgive our sins since it is we who are the first to believe (now).’
The Poets,26,52,And We revealed to Musa (Moses): ‘Take away My servants (from here) by night; you will certainly be chased.’
The Poets,26,53,Then Pharaoh sent callers to the cities.
The Poets,26,54,"(And he conveyed:) ‘Surely, these (Children of Israel) are but a small party."
The Poets,26,55,"And undoubtedly, they are provoking us."
The Poets,26,56,"And verily, we all are (also) alert and vigilant.’"
The Poets,26,57,"Then We drove them (Pharaoh’s people) out of gardens and springs,"
The Poets,26,58,And (also expelled them) from treasures and refined dwellings.
The Poets,26,59,So (We did) and made the Children of Israel inheritors of all (those bounties).
The Poets,26,60,"Then at sunrise, they (Pharaoh’s people) chased them."
The Poets,26,61,"So when the two parties came face to face, the companions of Musa (Moses) said: ‘(Now) we are sure to be caught.’"
The Poets,26,62,"(Musa [Moses]) said: ‘Never! Surely, my Lord is with me. He will show me the way (to deliverance) just now.’"
The Poets,26,63,Then We revealed to Musa (Moses): ‘Strike the sea with your staff.’ So the sea split (into twelve parts) and each part became like a huge mountain.
The Poets,26,64,And We brought the other party (Pharaoh and his companions) closer to that place.
The Poets,26,65,And We saved Musa (Moses) and (also) all those who were with him.
The Poets,26,66,"Then We drowned the others (i.e., Pharaoh and his people)."
The Poets,26,67,"Surely, in this (incident), there is a great sign (of Allah’s Infinite Power). And most of them were not believers."
The Poets,26,68,"And verily, your Lord alone is Almighty, Ever-Merciful indeed."
The Poets,26,69,And also recite to them the story of Ibrahim (Abraham).
The Poets,26,70,When he said to his father* and his people: ‘What do you worship?’
The Poets,26,71,They said: ‘We worship idols and remain stuck to their (worship and care).’
The Poets,26,72,(Ibrahim [Abraham]) said: ‘Do they hear you when you call (them)?
The Poets,26,73,Or do they bring you any profit or loss?’
The Poets,26,74,They said: ‘(We do not know that) but we found our fathers doing the same.’
The Poets,26,75,(Ibrahim [Abraham]) said: ‘Have you (ever) thought (of their reality) you worship?’
The Poets,26,76,(Did) you or (any of) your forefathers (ever realize)?
The Poets,26,77,So (all) these (idols) are enemies to me except the Lord of all the worlds. (He is the One Who is my God.)
The Poets,26,78,He Who created me and He is the One Who guides me.
The Poets,26,79,And He is the One Who provides me with food and drink.
The Poets,26,80,"And when I fall ill, He is the One Who cures me."
The Poets,26,81,"And He is the One Who will cause me to die and then He alone will give me life (again),"
The Poets,26,82,"And Who, I hope, will forgive me my misdeeds on the Day of Judgment."
The Poets,26,83,"O my Lord! Bless me with excellence in knowledge and deeds, and include me amongst those who deserve Your exceptional intimacy."
The Poets,26,84,And ordain for me virtuous remembrance and acceptance amongst the coming generations (too).
The Poets,26,85,And include me amongst the inheritors of the Garden of Bliss.
The Poets,26,86,"And forgive my father. Surely, he was of the misguided."
The Poets,26,87,"And disgrace me not on the Day (when) people will be raised up (from the graves),"
The Poets,26,88,The Day when neither wealth nor sons will profit.
The Poets,26,89,But he alone (will be the gainer) who appears before the presence of Allah with a heart protected (from) and pure (of all evils).’
The Poets,26,90,And (on that Day) Paradise will be brought closer to the Godfearing (and self-protecting).
The Poets,26,91,And Hell will be uncovered before the misguided.
The Poets,26,92,"And it will be said to them: ‘Where are those (idols) which you used to worship,"
The Poets,26,93,"Besides Allah? Can they help you, or can they help themselves (to protect themselves from Hell)?’"
The Poets,26,94,So into Hell will be thrown headlong (the idols as well as) the people who lost the straight road.
The Poets,26,95,And all the troops of Iblis (too will be hurled into Hell).
The Poets,26,96,Those (misguided people) will say whilst disputing amongst themselves (in the Hell):
The Poets,26,97,"‘By Allah, we were in manifest error,"
The Poets,26,98,When we held you equal to the Lord of all the worlds.
The Poets,26,99,And no other than (these) evildoers led us astray.
The Poets,26,100,So we do not have any intercessor (Today).
The Poets,26,101,Nor do we have any passionate friend.
The Poets,26,102,"Alas! If once we could have (a chance to) return (to the world), we would become believers.’"
The Poets,26,103,"Surely, in this (incident), there is a great sign (of Allah’s Infinite Power). And most of them were not the believers."
The Poets,26,104,"And verily, your Lord alone is Almighty, Ever-Merciful."
The Poets,26,105,The people of Nuh (Noah also) rejected the Messengers.
The Poets,26,106,When their (kinship) brother Nuh (Noah) said to them: ‘Do you not fear (Allah)?
The Poets,26,107,"Indeed, I (have come as) a trustworthy Messenger to you."
The Poets,26,108,So fear Allah and obey me.
The Poets,26,109,And I do not demand of you any wages for this (preaching of the truth). My reward is only with the Lord of all the worlds.
The Poets,26,110,So fear Allah and obey me.’
The Poets,26,111,They said: ‘Should we believe in you whilst the people of the lowest and most worthless (classes of society) are following you?’
The Poets,26,112,(Nuh [Noah]) said: ‘What has my knowledge to do with their (professional) tasks?
The Poets,26,113,Their account is only with my Lord. If you could but understand (what the real honour and dishonour is)!
The Poets,26,114,And I am not the one who casts out the believers.
The Poets,26,115,I am only a clear Warner.’
The Poets,26,116,"They said: ‘O Nuh (Noah), if you do not stop (saying these things), then surely you will be stoned to death.’"
The Poets,26,117,"(Nuh [Noah]) submitted: ‘O my Lord, my people have rejected me."
The Poets,26,118,"So judge between me and them, and deliver me and the believers who are in my company.’"
The Poets,26,119,So We delivered him and those who were (aboard) with him in the fully loaded Ark.
The Poets,26,120,Then thereafter We drowned all the rest.
The Poets,26,121,"Surely, in this (incident), there is a great sign (of Allah’s Infinite Power) and most of them were not the believers."
The Poets,26,122,"And verily, your Lord alone is Almighty, Ever-Merciful."
The Poets,26,123,(The people of) ‘Ad (too) rejected the Messengers.
The Poets,26,124,When their (kinship) brother Hud said to them: ‘Do you not fear (Allah)?
The Poets,26,125,"Verily, I (have come as) a trustworthy Messenger to you."
The Poets,26,126,So fear Allah and obey me.
The Poets,26,127,And I do not demand of you any wages for this (preaching of the truth). My reward is only with the Lord of all the worlds.
The Poets,26,128,Do you build a monument on every high point (merely) for vanity and vain pursuits?
The Poets,26,129,And do you erect strongly-built palaces (having pools) with the hope of living (in the world) forever?
The Poets,26,130,"And when you lay hand on someone, you do it like ruthless tyrants."
The Poets,26,131,So fear Allah and obey me.
The Poets,26,132,And fear Him (Allah) Who has helped you with the things which you know.
The Poets,26,133,"He has helped you with cattle and children,"
The Poets,26,134,And (also) with gardens and springs.
The Poets,26,135,"Surely, I fear the torment of a Terrible Day coming upon you.’"
The Poets,26,136,"They said: ‘It is all the same to us whether you admonish, or do not become of those who admonish (we shall not believe)."
The Poets,26,137,It is nothing (else) but the habits (and customs) of the ancients (which we cannot abandon).
The Poets,26,138,And we shall not be afflicted with the torment.
The Poets,26,139,"So they rejected him (Hud) and We destroyed them. Surely, in this (incident), there is a great sign (of Allah’s Infinite Power) and most of them were not the believers."
The Poets,26,140,"And verily, your Lord alone is Almighty, Ever-Merciful."
The Poets,26,141,(The people of) Thamud (also) rejected the Messengers.
The Poets,26,142,"When Salih, their (kinship) brother, said to them: ‘Do you not fear (Allah)?"
The Poets,26,143,"Verily, I (have come as) a trustworthy Messenger to you."
The Poets,26,144,So fear Allah and obey me.
The Poets,26,145,And I do not demand of you any wages for this (preaching of the truth). My reward is only with the Lord of all the worlds.
The Poets,26,146,Will you be left in peace and contentment (forever) in these (bounties) which are (available to you) here?
The Poets,26,147,(Here) in the gardens and springs?
The Poets,26,148,And in crops and palm-trees which have soft and fine blossoms?
The Poets,26,149,"And, skilled (in stone-carving), you carve out houses in the mountains."
The Poets,26,150,So fear Allah and obey me.
The Poets,26,151,"And do not obey the instructions of those who exceed limits,"
The Poets,26,152,Those who spread destructive activities in the land and do not do constructive works (for society).’
The Poets,26,153,They said: ‘You are but of the magic-stricken people.
The Poets,26,154,"You are but a human being like us, so bring some sign if you are truthful.’"
The Poets,26,155,"(Salih) said: ‘(That sign) is this she-camel. A time for water is (appointed) for her, and on an appointed day is your turn for water."
The Poets,26,156,"And do not touch her with evil (intention), or the torment of a (gravely) terrible day will seize you.’"
The Poets,26,157,But they hamstrung her (and killed her). Then they became remorseful (because of what they did).
The Poets,26,158,"So the torment seized them. Surely, in this (incident), there is a great sign and most of them were not the believers."
The Poets,26,159,"And verily, your Lord alone is Almighty, Ever-Merciful."
The Poets,26,160,"(The people of) Lut (Lot) also rejected the Messengers,"
The Poets,26,161,"When Lut (Lot), their (kinship) brother, said to them: ‘Do you not fear (Allah)?"
The Poets,26,162,"Verily, I (have come as) a trustworthy Messenger to you."
The Poets,26,163,So fear Allah and obey me.
The Poets,26,164,And I do not demand of you any wages for this (preaching of the truth). My reward is only with the Lord of all the worlds.
The Poets,26,165,Do you approach only males (to satisfy your sexual desire) from amongst the people of the world;
The Poets,26,166,And you leave your wives your Lord has created for you? You are rather of those who exceed bounds (in transgression).’
The Poets,26,167,"They said: ‘O Lut (Lot), if you do not stop (saying these things), you will surely become of the exiled.’"
The Poets,26,168,(Lut [Lot]) said: ‘No doubt I am of those who are disgusted by your practice.
The Poets,26,169,O Lord! Deliver me and my family from (the consequent suffering of) this practice which they are doing.’
The Poets,26,170,"So We delivered him and his entire family,"
The Poets,26,171,Except for an old woman who was amongst those who stayed behind.
The Poets,26,172,Then We destroyed the others.
The Poets,26,173,And We rained on them (stones). So how devastating was that rain on the people who were stressed with horror!
The Poets,26,174,"Surely, in this (incident), there is a great sign and most of them were not believers."
The Poets,26,175,"And verily, your Lord alone is Almighty, Ever-Merciful."
The Poets,26,176,"The dwellers of al-Ayka (i.e., the People of the Wood also) rejected the Messengers,"
The Poets,26,177,When Shu‘ayb said to them: ‘Do you not fear (Allah)?
The Poets,26,178,"Verily, I (have come as) a trustworthy Messenger to you."
The Poets,26,179,So fear Allah and obey me.
The Poets,26,180,And I do not demand of you any wages for this (preaching of the truth). My reward is only with the Lord of all the worlds.
The Poets,26,181,Always fill up full measure and do not become injurious (to the rights of the people).
The Poets,26,182,And weigh with a straight balance.
The Poets,26,183,"And do not give to the people their things (weighing) less than what is due, nor provoke strife in the land (by such moral, economic and social corruption and fraud)."
The Poets,26,184,And fear Him (Allah) Who has created you and the former generations.’
The Poets,26,185,"They said: ‘(O Shu‘ayb,) you are but of the magic-stricken people."
The Poets,26,186,"And you are but a human being like us, and surely we consider you amongst the liars."
The Poets,26,187,"So, make a piece of heaven fall on us if you are truthful.’"
The Poets,26,188,(Shu‘ayb) said: ‘My Lord knows best these (frauds) which you are doing.’
The Poets,26,189,"So they rejected Shu‘ayb, and the torment of the Day of Shadow seized them. No doubt, that was the torment of a terrible day."
The Poets,26,190,"Surely, in this (incident), there is a great sign and most of them were not believers."
The Poets,26,191,"And verily, your Lord alone is Almighty, Ever-Merciful."
The Poets,26,192,"And indeed, this Qur’an has been revealed by the Lord of all the worlds."
The Poets,26,193,"The Trusted Spirit (Gabriel) has descended with it,"
The Poets,26,194,Upon your (most illumined) heart so that you may be a Warner (to the disobedient).
The Poets,26,195,(It is sent down) in the plain Arabic language.
The Poets,26,196,"And verily, it is (also mentioned) in the scriptures of the former communities."
The Poets,26,197,And is it not for them a (sufficient) proof (of the truth of the Qur’an and the truth of Muhammad’s Prophethood [blessings and peace be upon him]) that the learned scholars of the Children of Israel (also) recognize it?
The Poets,26,198,"And if We had sent it down to any of the non-Arabs,"
The Poets,26,199,"And he had recited it to these people, (even then) they would not have believed in it."
The Poets,26,200,Thus have We forced its (denial) firmly into the hearts of the sinners.
The Poets,26,201,They will not believe in it until they see the painful torment.
The Poets,26,202,"So that (torment) will come upon them all of a sudden, and they will not (even) perceive it."
The Poets,26,203,They will then say: ‘Shall we be given respite?’
The Poets,26,204,Do they seek to hasten Our punishment?
The Poets,26,205,"Tell Me, if We provide them benefit for years,"
The Poets,26,206,"Then comes to them that (torment) which they are being promised,"
The Poets,26,207,Then what will those resources which they were utilizing do (to drive that torment away from them)?
The Poets,26,208,"And We have not destroyed any town except those (towns) for which Warners had come,"
The Poets,26,209,(And that too) for direction and guidance. And We were not unjust.
The Poets,26,210,And it is not satans who descended with this (Qur’an).
The Poets,26,211,They are neither worthy nor capable (of it).
The Poets,26,212,"Surely, they have been debarred from hearing (this divine communication)."
The Poets,26,213,"So, (O My servant,) do not call upon any other god besides Allah lest you become of those who are punished."
The Poets,26,214,"And, (O Esteemed Beloved,) warn your close relatives (of Our torment)."
The Poets,26,215,"And extend your (merciful, kind and supporting) hand to those believers who follow you."
The Poets,26,216,"But, if they disobey you, then say: ‘I am disgusted by these (evil) deeds which you are doing.’"
The Poets,26,217,"And put your trust in Almighty, Ever-Merciful (Lord),"
The Poets,26,218,"Who sees you when you stand up (for Tahajjud Prayer in the solitary hours at night),"
The Poets,26,219,And Who (also keeps) seeing your turning movements amongst those who prostrate themselves in Prayer.
The Poets,26,220,"Verily, He is All-Hearing, All-Knowing."
The Poets,26,221,Shall I tell you upon whom the satans descend?
The Poets,26,222,"They descend on every lying sinner (who weaves false allegations),"
The Poets,26,223,Who pour (into their ears) hearsay and most of them are liars.
The Poets,26,224,And only the digressers follow the poets.
The Poets,26,225,Have you not seen that these (poets) wander distracted (purposelessly) in every valley (of reflections? They take little serious and true interest in reality. They rather remain happy and lost in verbal leaps and imaginative jumps).
The Poets,26,226,"And that they say (such things) that they do not (themselves) do,"
The Poets,26,227,"Except for those (poets) who believe and do pious deeds persistently and remember Allah abundantly (i.e., they eulogize Allah and the Holy Prophet [blessings and peace be upon him] in their poetry), and avenge themselves after they are wronged (by means of poetic compositions, and defend Islam and the oppressed rather inspire them with zeal through their poetry. This type of poetry is not condemnable.) And those who do wrong will soon come to know to what place of turning they will turn back (after death)."
The Ant,27,1,"Ta, Sin. (Only Allah and the Messenger [blessings and peace be upon him] know the real meaning.) These are the Verses of the (Holy) Qur’an and an enlightening Book—"
The Ant,27,2,"A guidance and good news for (those) believers,"
The Ant,27,3,"Who establish prayer and pay Zakat (the Alms-due), and it is they who believe in the Hereafter (as well)."
The Ant,27,4,"Surely, those who do not believe in the Hereafter, We have made their (evil) deeds appear fascinating (to them). So they wander distracted (in error)."
The Ant,27,5,"It is they for whom there is an evil punishment, and it is they who are (the greatest) losers in the Hereafter."
The Ant,27,6,"And surely, you are being taught (this) Qur’an from the All-Wise, All-Knowing (Lord)."
The Ant,27,7,"(Recall that incident) when Musa (Moses) said to his wife: ‘I have seen a fire (or I have perceived a flash of love and liking in the fire). Soon I shall bring you some news from it (for which we have been wandering in deserts and forests since long), or I shall bring (you also from there) some burning brand so that you (too) may feel the burn (of its heat).’"
The Ant,27,8,"So when he neared it, a call was given: ‘Blessed is He Who is (luminously unveiling His veil of Light) in this fire, and (also) he who is around it (in the reflection of the theophanies of Allah’s Light). And Allah is Holy (and Glorified, High above any resemblance and physical manifestation), the Lord of all the worlds."
The Ant,27,9,"O Musa (Moses)! It is I, Allah (Unveiling My Light), Almighty, All-Wise."
The Ant,27,10,"And, (O Musa [Moses],) cast your staff (on the ground).’ So when (Musa (Moses) after casting the staff on the ground) saw it moving fast as if it were a serpent, he (reacting naturally) turned back running and did not (even) look back. (Allah said:) ‘O Musa (Moses), do not fear. Surely, the Messengers do not fear in My presence."
The Ant,27,11,"But whoever wrongs, then after doing evil replaces (it) with good, then I am indeed Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful."
The Ant,27,12,"And put your hand into the opening of your collar. It will come out radiant white without any ill. (Both these are) of the nine signs (of Allah). Go (with them) to Pharaoh and his people. Surely, they are a disobedient people.’"
The Ant,27,13,"But when Our clear and sight-giving signs reached them, they said: ‘This is plain magic.’"
The Ant,27,14,"And out of vanity and wickedness, they rejected them straight away whilst their hearts had accepted these (signs as true). So see how (evil) was the end of the evildoers!"
The Ant,27,15,"And indeed, We bestowed upon Dawud (David) and Sulayman ([Solomon] extraordinary knowledge) and both said: ‘All praise be to Allah, Who has exalted us above many of His believing servants.’"
The Ant,27,16,"And Sulayman (Solomon) succeeded Dawud (David) and said: ‘O people, we have been taught the speech of birds (as well) and we have been granted everything. No doubt, this is the most obvious Grace (of Allah).’"
The Ant,27,17,"And armies for Sulayman (Solomon) were collected from amongst (all species of) the jinn, human beings and birds. So they were held on (in his service) for discipline and training."
The Ant,27,18,"Until when these (troops) reached an open field of ants, one ant said: ‘O ants, enter your dwellings, lest Sulayman (Solomon) and his troops crush you whilst they remain just unaware.’"
The Ant,27,19,"So he (Sulayman [Solomon]) smiled, feeling amused at the ant’s words, and submitted: ‘O Lord, keep me by Your bestowal firm on it that I remain ever-thankful for Your favour You have conferred on me and on my parents, and I do such pious deeds as You are pleased with, and admit me by Your mercy amongst Your pious slaves enjoying exceptional nearness to You.’"
The Ant,27,20,And Sulayman (Solomon) inspected the birds and said: ‘How is it that I do not see the hoopoe? Or has he (really) vanished?
The Ant,27,21,"I will certainly award him severe punishment (for being absent without leave), or will certainly slaughter him, or he will bring me a sound plea (of being not guilty).’"
The Ant,27,22,"It was only for a little while that he stayed (outside), then he (appeared and) said: ‘I have come to know a thing that is (perhaps) not in your knowledge, and I have brought you from (the land of) Saba (Sheba) a sure and true piece of news."
The Ant,27,23,"I have found (there) a woman who is ruling over them (i.e., the citizens of the land of Saba [Sheba]), and she has been given everything (of possession and authority), and she has a great throne."
The Ant,27,24,"I found her and her people prostrating themselves before the sun instead of Allah. And Satan has made their (evil) deeds highly fascinating to them, and has hindered them from the path (of the Oneness of Allah). So they are not getting guidance."
The Ant,27,25,"(They are hindered) so that they do not fall in prostration before the presence of Allah, Who brings forth (i.e., unveils the realities and forms of matter) hidden in the heavens and the earth and knows (all) those things which you hide and which you disclose."
The Ant,27,26,There is none worthy of worship except Allah. He alone is the Master of the Supreme Throne of Authority.’
The Ant,27,27,(Sulayman [Solomon]) said: ‘We see right now whether you speak the truth or you are of the liars.
The Ant,27,28,Go with this letter of mine and deliver it to them. Then withdraw from them and see what they turn to.’
The Ant,27,29,"(The Queen) said: ‘O chiefs, a noble letter has been delivered to me."
The Ant,27,30,"That (letter) has indeed (come) from Sulayman (Solomon), and that begins with the Name of Allah, Who is Most Kind, Ever-Merciful."
The Ant,27,31,(Its contents read:) ‘Do not (strive to) rise above me and come to me in submission.’
The Ant,27,32,"(The Queen) said: ‘O courtiers, advise me in this matter. I do not make a final decision on any matter until you come to me and state your opinions (for or against the matter).’"
The Ant,27,33,They said: ‘We are powerful and great warriors but the command is your prerogative. So consider (yourself) what command you should give.’
The Ant,27,34,"(The Queen) said: ‘No doubt when kings enter a town, they destroy it and disgrace and humiliate its elite citizens. And these (people) too will do the same."
The Ant,27,35,"And, surely, I am sending him some gifts and see what reply the messengers bring back.’"
The Ant,27,36,"So when that (messenger) came to Sulayman (Solomon, he) said (to him [i.e., the messenger]): ‘Do you want to help me with wealth, whereas what Allah has given me is better than this (wealth) which He has given you? It is rather you who take pleasure (and) pride in your gifts."
The Ant,27,37,"So go back to them (with your gifts). We shall come with such troops (to invade) them that they will not have (the power) to fight back, and, humiliating them, we shall drive them out from there in such a plight that they will be dishonoured (becoming prisoners).’"
The Ant,27,38,"Sulayman (Solomon) said: ‘O courtiers, which of you can bring me the throne (of the Queen) before they come to me in submission?’"
The Ant,27,39,One mighty jinn submitted: ‘I can bring it to you before you rise from your seat. And I am indeed powerful (enough) and trustworthy (to bring it).’
The Ant,27,40,"Then the one who had some knowledge of the (heavenly) Book submitted: ‘I can bring it to you before your vision turns back to you (i.e., even before the twinkling of an eye).’ So, when (Sulayman [Solomon]) saw it (the throne) placed before him, he said: ‘This is by the Grace of my Lord so that He may put me to the test whether I thank (Him) or not. And he who thanks (Allah), his gratitude is for the good of his own self, and he who is ungrateful, then surely my Lord is Self-Sufficient, Most Generous.’"
The Ant,27,41,Sulayman (Solomon) said: ‘(To test the Queen) change the display and appearance of her throne. We shall see whether she gets some clue (to recognize it) or proves to be of those who do not have quick reflexes.’
The Ant,27,42,"Then when she (the Queen) came, she was asked: ‘Is your throne like this?’ She said: ‘It looks as if it is the same and we have already known (the truth of Sulayman’s [Solomon’s] Prophethood) and we have become Muslims.’"
The Ant,27,43,"And the (false god) she worshipped besides Allah prevented her (the Queen from accepting the truth before this). No doubt, she was of a disbelieving people."
The Ant,27,44,"It was said to her (the Queen): ‘Enter the compound of the palace (beneath which were flowing waves of bluish water).’ So when the Queen saw that (elegant, crystal floor), she thought it was a deep pool. And (pulling up her skirt) she uncovered her lower legs. Sulayman (Solomon) said: ‘This is the compound of the palace paved with crystal slabs.’ The Queen submitted: ‘O my Lord, (I was deluded in like manner.) Surely, I wronged my soul. And now along with Sulayman (Solomon), I submit to Allah, Who is the Lord of all the worlds.’"
The Ant,27,45,"And, surely, We sent to the people of Thamud their (kinship) brother Salih (as a Messenger:) ‘Worship Allah.’ Then they became two parties disputing with each other."
The Ant,27,46,"(Salih) said: ‘O my people, why do you hasten the evil (i.e., torment) before the good (i.e., mercy)? Why do you not ask for forgiveness from Allah so that you are shown mercy?’"
The Ant,27,47,"They said: ‘You have caused us misfortune, and so have your companions.’ (Salih) said: ‘(The cause of) your misfortune is (written) with Allah; you people have rather been put to trial.’"
The Ant,27,48,And there were in the city (of the people of Thamud) nine prominent leaders (leading their respective parties) who used to spread destructive activities in the land and would not do constructive works.
The Ant,27,49,"(These leaders) said: ‘Vow amongst yourselves by swearing in the Name of Allah that we will certainly launch a murder attack against Salih and his family at night, and will then tell their heirs that we were not present on the occasion of their murder. And surely, we are telling the truth.’"
The Ant,27,50,"And they worked out a plan in secret, and We (also) devised a secret scheme (to foil that), and they did not get a hint of it."
The Ant,27,51,"See then what was the end of their (wicked) plan! Surely, We destroyed those (leaders) and their entire people altogether."
The Ant,27,52,"So these are their houses lying ruined, for they committed oppression and injustice. No doubt there is a sign (of warning) in it for those who have knowledge."
The Ant,27,53,And We delivered those who believed and became Godfearing.
The Ant,27,54,And (recall) Lut (Lot) when he said to his people: ‘Do you commit indecency whilst you see (as well)?
The Ant,27,55,Do you approach men rather than women to satisfy your sexual desire? The truth is that you are ignorant people.’
The Ant,27,56,The only answer of his people was that they said: ‘Drive out the family of Lut (Lot) from your town; they claim to be very pious!’
The Ant,27,57,"So We delivered Lut (Lot) and his family except his wife, for We destined her to be amongst those who stayed behind (for torment)."
The Ant,27,58,And We heavily rained upon them (stones). So evil was the rain (of stones) upon those people who were stressed with horror.
The Ant,27,59,"Say: ‘All praise be to Allah, and peace be upon His Servants whom He has chosen (and exalted). Is Allah better or those (false gods) that these people associate (with Him)?’"
The Ant,27,60,"Well, Who has created the heavens and the earth and poured down water for you from the atmosphere in the sky? Then with that (water), We brought forth fresh and beautiful gardens. It was not possible for you to grow plants in these (gardens). Is there any (other) God besides Allah? In fact, they are the people who are turning away (from the path of truth)."
The Ant,27,61,"Or, Who made the earth a dwelling place and made rivers amid it and made for it huge mountains and put a barrier between the two seas (of salt and sweet waters)? Is there any (other) God besides Allah? But most of these (disbelievers) do not have knowledge."
The Ant,27,62,"Or, Who grants the supplication of the anxiety-stricken caller when he calls upon Him, and Who removes the trouble and makes you successors and inheritors (of the predecessors) in the earth? Is there any (other) God besides Allah? You people accept advice but little."
The Ant,27,63,"Or, Who guides you in the darkness of land and sea and sends winds as good news before (the rain of) His mercy? Is there any (other) God besides Allah? Exalted is Allah, High above (the false gods) which they associate with Him."
The Ant,27,64,"Well, Who originates creation and shall repeat the same (process of creation), and Who grants you sustenance from the heavens and the earth? Is there any (other) God besides Allah? Say: ‘(O polytheists,) bring your proof if you are truthful.’"
The Ant,27,65,"Say: ‘Those who are in the heavens and the earth do not have the knowledge of the unseen (by themselves) except Allah (Who is Self-Knowing), nor do they know when they will be raised up (alive again).’"
The Ant,27,66,"The truth is that their knowledge about the Hereafter terminated after reaching (its) limit, but they are just (caught) in doubt about it. Nay, they are blind to its (exact knowledge)."
The Ant,27,67,"And the disbelievers say: ‘When we and our fathers become dust (after death), shall we be brought forth (from graves alive)?"
The Ant,27,68,"In fact, we and, before this, our ancestors (too) have been promised this. These are but stories fabricated by the ancients.’"
The Ant,27,69,Say: ‘Travel in the land and see how was the end of the evildoers.’
The Ant,27,70,"And, (O Esteemed Beloved,) do not grieve (over what they say), nor (undergo) distress at the deceitful and treacherous activities which they are carrying out."
The Ant,27,71,And they say: ‘(Tell us) when this promise (of the Last Day) will come true if you are truthful.’
The Ant,27,72,Say: ‘It is not far from possible that a part of that (torment) which you seek to hasten has nearly reached you.’
The Ant,27,73,"And surely, your Lord is Gracious to the people but most of them do not give thanks."
The Ant,27,74,"And certainly, your Lord knows well what their breasts hide and also what they make known."
The Ant,27,75,And there is nothing hidden in the heavens and the earth but is recorded in a Clear Book (al-Lawh al-Mahfuz).
The Ant,27,76,"Surely, this Qur’an expounds to the Children of Israel most of the things in which they differ."
The Ant,27,77,"And verily, it is guidance and mercy for the believers."
The Ant,27,78,"Verily, your Lord will judge between these (believers and disbelievers) by His command (of justice). And He is Almighty, All-Knowing."
The Ant,27,79,"So put your trust in Allah. Surely, you are (firm and fixed) on the evident truth."
The Ant,27,80,"(O Beloved!) Surely, you make neither the dead (i.e., the disbelievers deprived of the vitality of faith) hear your call nor the deaf (i.e., deprived of hearing the call of truth) while they are getting away (from you) turning their backs.*"
The Ant,27,81,"Nor can you guide the blind (of heart, rescuing them) from their wrong path. (In fact) you make only them hear who (accepting your call) believe in Our Revelations. So it is they who are Muslims (and only they deserve to be called alive)."
The Ant,27,82,"And when the time to execute Our command (of torment) against them comes, We shall bring out for them from the earth a beast who will converse with them because people do not have certitude in Our signs."
The Ant,27,83,"And the Day when We shall gather out of every community a party of those who used to reject Our Revelations, they will be stopped (from the front in order that they all move together)."
The Ant,27,84,"Till, when they all reach (the point of reckoning), it will be said: ‘Did you reject My Revelations (without meditating on them), whereas you could not thoroughly understand them with (your inadequate) knowledge? Or (tell yourselves) what else was (the reason) that you used to (belie the truth).’"
The Ant,27,85,And (Our) promise against them has been fulfilled because they continued doing injustice. So they will not be able to say anything (in reply).
The Ant,27,86,"Have they not seen that We made the night for them so that they might rest in it and the day sight-giving (to oversee the affairs of life and to make things visible and perceptible)? Indeed, there are signs in it for those who believe."
The Ant,27,87,"And on the Day when the trumpet is blown, (all) those in the heavens and in the earth will be terrified except those whom Allah wills (they will not worry). And all will appear before His presence submissively."
The Ant,27,88,"And, (O man,) you will see the mountains and think them firmly fixed, whereas they will be flying like the passing of clouds. (This) is the work of Allah, Who has made everything strong and stable (with wisdom and strategy). Surely, He is Well Aware of all (the works) that you do."
The Ant,27,89,"Whoever brings good (that Day), for him (the reward) will be better than that, and they will be peaceful and secure against terror that Day."
The Ant,27,90,And whoever brings evil will be thrown prone into the Fire (of Hell). So you will be rewarded only for what you used to do.
The Ant,27,91,"(Say to them:) ‘I have been commanded only to worship the Lord of this city (Mecca), Who has made it Holy and Sacred, and everything belongs to Him alone. And I have (also) been commanded to be of those who submit wholly (to Allah),"
The Ant,27,92,"And that I keep reciting the Qur’an. So whoever accepts guidance takes the straight path only for his own benefit, and (to him) who wanders on in error, say: ‘I am only of the Warners.’"
The Ant,27,93,And say: ‘All praise belongs to Allah alone. Soon He will show you His signs and you will recognize them. And your Lord is not unaware of what you do.’
The Story,28,1,"Ta, Sin, Mim. (Only Allah and the Messenger [blessings and peace be upon him] know the real meaning.)"
The Story,28,2,These are the Verses of the enlightening Book.
The Story,28,3,(O Esteemed Beloved!) We recite to you from the true account of Musa (Moses) and Pharaoh for those who have believed.
The Story,28,4,"Certainly, Pharaoh had become an arrogant rebel (i.e., a tyrannical despot) in the land, and he had divided the citizens of his (state) into (various) sects (and groups). He had oppressed and weakened one of these groups (the population comprising the Children of Israel). He used to kill their sons (to crush their future strength), and let their women live (to increase their number without men and spread immorality and indecency amongst them). Surely, he was one of those who rouse disruption."
The Story,28,5,"And We wanted to do favour to the people who had been weakened in the land (through oppression, exploitation and deprivation of rights and freedom) and make them leaders (of the oppressed people) and inheritors (of the throne of the kingdom);"
The Story,28,6,And to give them governance and power in the land and show Pharaoh and Haman and their armies (the revolution) that they used to fear.
The Story,28,7,"And We revealed to the heart of the mother of Musa (Moses): ‘Suckle him on, but when you fear (for his life), put him afloat into the river, and be not afraid (of this situation) nor grieve. Surely, We shall bring him back to you, and shall make him one of Our Messengers.’"
The Story,28,8,"Then Pharaoh’s family picked him up (from the river) so that (by the will of Allah) he proved for them an enemy and (a cause of) grief. Surely, Pharaoh, Haman and their armies were the evildoers."
The Story,28,9,And the wife of Pharaoh said (on seeing Musa [Moses]): ‘(This child) is coolness of eyes for me and for you; do not kill him. He may perhaps bring us benefit or we may adopt him as a son.’ And they were unaware (of the outcome of this plan).
The Story,28,10,"And the heart of Musa’s (Moses’s) mother felt empty (of patience). And she would nearly have disclosed the secret (owing to her impatience), had We not energized her heart with the strength of peace and patience so that she might remain one of the firm believers (in Allah’s promise)."
The Story,28,11,"And (Musa’s [Moses’s] mother) said to his sister: ‘Follow him (to be aware of him).’ So she watched him from a distance, but they were (completely) unaware."
The Story,28,12,And We had in advance prohibited him from the feed of wet nurses. So (Musa’s [Moses’s] sister) said: ‘Shall I tell you about a family who will bring up this (child) for you and will (also) be his well-wisher?’
The Story,28,13,So (this way) We returned Musa (Moses) to his mother so that her eyes might keep cool and so that she might not feel grieved and in order that she might know (with certitude) that Allah’s promise is true but most of the people do not know.
The Story,28,14,"And when Musa (Moses) reached his maturity and (the age of) moderation and stability, We honoured him with the command (of Prophethood) and knowledge and wisdom. And that is how We reward the righteous."
The Story,28,15,"And Musa (Moses) entered the city (in Egypt) at a time when its people were lying (asleep) unaware. There he found two men fighting with each other, one from his (own) party (the Children of Israel), and the other from his enemies (the people of Pharaoh). The man from his own party asked him for help against the other who was from his enemies. So Musa (Moses) struck him with his fist and killed him. (Then) he said: ‘This is Satan’s work (which I have committed); no doubt he is an open, misleading enemy.’"
The Story,28,16,"(Musa [Moses]) submitted: ‘O my Lord, no doubt I have wronged my soul; so bless me with forgiveness.’ Then He forgave him. Surely, He is the Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful."
The Story,28,17,"(Moreover) he submitted: ‘O my Lord, because of Your favour (of forgiveness) You have blessed me with, I shall never be a helper of the wrongdoers.’"
The Story,28,18,"So Musa (Moses), anxious and afraid, kept waiting till morning (to discover what would happen next). Then, suddenly, the man who sought his help the day before was crying out to him for help (again). Musa (Moses) said to him: ‘Surely, you are the one who has truly lost the right path.’"
The Story,28,19,"Then, when Musa (Moses) decided to catch hold of the person who was an enemy to both of them, he exclaimed: ‘O Musa (Moses), do you want to kill me (too) as you killed a man the day before? You intend only to become a tyrant in the land, and you do not desire to become one of the reformers.’"
The Story,28,20,"And a man came running from the far end of the city and said: ‘O Musa (Moses), the chiefs (of the people of Pharaoh) are counselling about you to kill you, so depart (from here). Surely, I am of your well-wishers.’"
The Story,28,21,"So Musa (Moses), afraid and waiting for (Allah’s help), went off from there. He prayed: ‘O my Lord, deliver me from the oppressing people.’"
The Story,28,22,"And when he moved towards Madyan, he said: ‘I hope my Lord will show me the straight path (to take me to the desired destination).’"
The Story,28,23,"And when he arrived at the watering (well) of Madyan, he found there a crowd of people watering (their flocks). And on a side, he saw two women, withdrawn, holding back (their goats. Musa [Moses]) asked: ‘Why are you (standing) in this condition?’ Both said: ‘We cannot water (our goats) till the shepherds take back their flocks and our father is an aged man.’"
The Story,28,24,"So he watered their (flocks) and then turned back to the shade and submitted: ‘O Lord, I am in need of whatever good You send down to me.’"
The Story,28,25,"Then (after a while) one of those two (girls) came to him walking modestly. She said: ‘My father invites you so that he may reward you for (your labour in) watering (the flocks) for us. So when Musa (Moses) came to (Shu‘ayb, the father of those girls,) and narrated to him (the preceding) incidents, he said: ‘Do not fear. You are safe and secure from the oppressive people.’"
The Story,28,26,"One of those (girls) said: ‘O (my) respectable father, take him (into your service). Surely, the best person you can employ is the one who is strong and trustworthy (and he is worthy of this assignment).’"
The Story,28,27,"He said (to Musa [Moses]): ‘I intend to marry to you one of my two daughters by (the dower) that you serve me on hire for eight years, but if you complete ten (years), it will be (a favour) from you. And I do not want to make it hard for you. If Allah wills, you will find me of the pious.’"
The Story,28,28,"Musa (Moses) said: ‘This (agreement) is (settled) between me and you. Whichever of the two terms I complete, I shall not be forced. And Allah is the Custodian over what we say.’"
The Story,28,29,"So when Musa (Moses) completed the appointed term and set out with his wife, he saw a fire in the direction of Tur. (That was a flash of absolute beauty which caught his heart and fascinated him.) He said to his wife: ‘Stay (here). I have seen a fire. I may bring you some news (about Him) from that (fire in whose pursuit I have long been wandering), or (I may bring you) some burning brand from the (febrile) fire so that you (too) may feel the burn.’"
The Story,28,30,"When Musa (Moses) reached there, a call was made from the right side of (the blessed Tur) valley from a tree (located) in a blessed spot: ‘O Musa (Moses), verily, I am Allah, the Sustainer of all the worlds."
The Story,28,31,"And throw your staff (on the ground).’ So when Musa (Moses) saw it moving fast, coiling and curling as if it was a snake, he turned his back, jogged off and did not look behind. (The Voice said:) ‘O Musa (Moses), come forth and do not fear. Surely, you are of the secure."
The Story,28,32,"Put your hand inside your collar opening. It will come out shining white without any disease. And flex your hand close to your (breast to remove) fear. These two signs from your Lord are for (sending to) Pharaoh and his courtiers (to observe). Surely, they are disobedient people.’"
The Story,28,33,"Musa (Moses) submitted: ‘O Lord, I killed one of them, so I fear they would kill me."
The Story,28,34,"And my brother Harun (Aaron) is more communicative and eloquent in speech than I, so send him with me as a helper that he may bear me out. And I (also) fear that they will reject me.’"
The Story,28,35,(Allah) said: ‘We shall strengthen your arm with your brother and shall create for both of you dread and dominance (in the hearts of the people and in the impact of your endeavours). So they will not be able to reach you (to do harm) because of Our signs. You two and your followers will triumph and prevail.’
The Story,28,36,"So when Musa (Moses) came to them with Our clear and enlightening Signs, they said: ‘This is nothing but invented magic; we (never) heard of these things amongst our ancestors.’"
The Story,28,37,"And Musa (Moses) said: ‘My Lord knows best the one who has brought guidance from Him, and (also) the one for whom the House of the Hereafter will be the (best) end. Surely, the wrongdoers will not prosper.’"
The Story,28,38,"And Pharaoh said: ‘O courtiers, I do not know any god other than me for you. O Haman! Kindle a fire on clay (to bake bricks) for me; then build me a high tower (with them. Climbing it,) I may perhaps have an access to the Lord of Musa (Moses). And I regard him as one of the liars.’"
The Story,28,39,"And he (Pharaoh) himself and his warriors were unjust in the land, committing arrogance and defiance and thought they would not be brought back to Us."
The Story,28,40,So We seized him and his forces (in the torment) and threw them into the sea. Observe then how (terrible) was the end of the tyrants!
The Story,28,41,"And We made them the leaders (of the inmates of Hell), for they used to invite (people) towards Hell. And they will not be given any help on the Day of Resurrection."
The Story,28,42,"And We made a curse to chase them in this world, and on the Day of Resurrection (as well) they will be (counted) amongst the miserable."
The Story,28,43,"And surely, after (this situation that) We had destroyed the former (defiant) communities, We gave Musa (Moses) the Book which was (a rich source of) vision, guidance and mercy for the people so that they might take advice."
The Story,28,44,"And you were not (present at that time) on the western side (of Tur) when We sent the command (of Prophethood) towards Musa (Moses), nor were you amongst (those seventy people who were) witnesses (to the Revelation to Musa [Moses]. So what else is this narration except the news of the unseen?)"
The Story,28,45,But We raised many generations (successively after Musa [Moses]) and long ages passed over them. Nor were you living amongst the people of Madyan (like Musa [Moses] and Shu‘ayb) reciting Our Verses to them. But it is for Us to send (you exalting with tidings of the unseen).
The Story,28,46,"Nor were you (present at that time) on the side of Tur when We called out to Musa (Moses). But (enlightening you on all these matters of the unseen) is an (exceptional) mercy from your Lord so that (having awareness of these incidents) you may warn these people (of the torment of Allah) to whom no Warner has come before you, in order that they may accept admonition."
The Story,28,47,"And (We would not send any Messenger) if this was not the case that when some suffering should seize them due to their own evil deeds which they did, they would say: ‘O our Lord, why did You not send us any Messenger so that we might follow Your Revelations and become of the believers?’"
The Story,28,48,"Then when the truth came to them from Our presence, they said: ‘Why has this (Messenger) not been given the (signs) like those (signs) which were given to Musa (Moses)?’ Did they not deny those (signs) which were given to Musa (Moses) before this? They said: ‘Both (the Qur’an as well as the Torah) are magic (which) confirm and agree with each other.’ And they said: ‘We deny all (of them).’"
The Story,28,49,"Say: ‘Bring some (other) book from Allah which guides better than these two, (then) I shall follow that if you are truthful (in your blames).’"
The Story,28,50,"But if they do not accept what you say, then know that (they do not have any logic); they merely follow their lusts. And who can be more astray than the one who follows his desire, abandoning the guidance from Allah? Surely, Allah does not guide the wrongdoers."
The Story,28,51,"And in fact, We kept sending for them successive commands (of the Qur’an) so that they might take direction and guidance."
The Story,28,52,"Those whom We gave the Book before this, they believe in this (Qur’an as well in the continuation of the same guidance)."
The Story,28,53,"And when (the Qur’an) is recited to them, they say: ‘We believe in it; verily, it is the truth from our Lord. In fact, we had become Muslims (i.e., the yielding) even before this.’"
The Story,28,54,"It is these people who will be given their reward twice because they remained steadfast and fended off evil with good, and spent in Our way out of the bounty We bestowed upon them."
The Story,28,55,"And when they hear anything absurd, they turn away from it and say: ‘For us are our deeds and for you are your deeds. Peace be upon you! We do not want (to adopt the mentality and conduct of) the ignorant. (Why should we give up our good for the sake of their evil?)’"
The Story,28,56,"The truth is that whoever you like (to bring on to the path of guidance), you do not yourself bring him on to the path of guidance. Instead, (it so happens that) whomever Allah pleases, He makes him tread the path of guidance (through your mediation). And He knows best those who find the path of guidance."
The Story,28,57,"And (the ignorant of its value) say: ‘If we follow the guidance in your company, we shall be snatched out of our land.’ Have We not made them settle in (this) secure and peaceful Sanctuary (Mecca—your own land) where all kinds of fruits are supplied (from all over the world) as sustenance from Us? But most of them do not know (for whose sake this whole process operates)."
The Story,28,58,And how many towns have We destroyed that became arrogant and ungrateful on account of their prosperous economies! So here are (the remains of) their (ruined) houses that have been inhabited after them but little. And We alone are the Inheritor and Owner (in the end).
The Story,28,59,And your Lord does not destroy the towns until He sends to their capital city a Messenger who recites to them Our Verses. And We do not destroy towns unless their dwellers are given to oppression.
The Story,28,60,"And whatever you have been given are but provisions of the worldly life, its charms and beauty. But what is (yet) with Allah is far better (than this) and eternal. Do you not understand (this fact)?"
The Story,28,61,"Can he to whom We have made an excellent promise (pertaining to Hereafter), and who becomes one to attain to it be like the (ill-fated) one We have given the good things of worldly life, then (owing to ingratitude for the bounties) becomes of those who will be brought forth on the Last Day (for punishment)?"
The Story,28,62,And the Day when (Allah) will call them and say: ‘Where are those that you regarded as My partners and considered them (gods)?’
The Story,28,63,"The people against whom the command (of torment) has been proved will say: ‘O our Lord, it is these people who we misguided. We led them astray (the same way) as we (ourselves) lost the right path. We turn to You showing our disgust towards them and (in fact) they did not worship us. (They rather worshipped their lusts.)’"
The Story,28,64,And it will be said (to them): ‘Call your (self-made) partners.’ So they will call them but they (the partners) will not respond to them and those people will see the torment. Would that they had taken guidance (in the world)!
The Story,28,65,"And the Day when (Allah) will call to them, He will say: ‘What answer did you serve to the Messengers?’"
The Story,28,66,"On that Day, all information will become unknown to them, and they will not be able to ask (even) one another."
The Story,28,67,But whoever repents and believes and does pious deeds will surely be of those who are successful.
The Story,28,68,"And your Lord creates whatever He wills and chooses (whom He pleases for Prophethood and for the right of intercession). These (disbelievers and polytheists) have no authority or choice (in this matter). Holy is Allah the Glorious and Exalted, far above (the false gods) that they associate as partners (with Allah)!"
The Story,28,69,And your Lord knows (all) what their breasts hide (inside) and what they make known.
The Story,28,70,And He alone is Allah; apart from Him there is no God. All praise belongs to Him in the world and in the Hereafter. And His alone is the (true) command and rule and to Him alone will you be returned.
The Story,28,71,"Say: ‘Just answer: If Allah prolongs the night over you till the Day of Resurrection, (then) what god is there besides Allah who will bring you light? Do you not hear (these words)?’"
The Story,28,72,"Say: ‘Just tell me this (as well): If Allah prolongs the day over you till the Day of Resurrection, (then) what god is there besides Allah who will bring you night in which you may take rest? Do you not see?’"
The Story,28,73,And it is out of His mercy that He has made night and day for you so that at night you may take rest and (during the day) you may seek His bounty (sustenance) and so that you may become grateful.
The Story,28,74,And the Day when He will call to them and say: ‘Where are they who you regarded as My partners and considered (gods)?’
The Story,28,75,"And We shall take out from every community a witness, and We shall then say (to the disbelievers): ‘Bring your proof.’ Then they will know that the truth belongs to Allah, and all (the lies) they used to invent will disappear from them."
The Story,28,76,"No doubt Qarun (Korah) was of the people of Musa (Moses) but he oppressed them. And We gave him so much of treasures that it was hard for a powerful party of strong men to (carry) his keys whilst his people said to him: ‘Do not be arrogant and conceited (out of rejoicing). Verily, Allah does not like those who gloat."
The Story,28,77,"And seek the home of the Hereafter with what (wealth) Allah has given you, and (also) do not forget your share of the world. And do (such) good (to the people) as Allah has done good to you. But do not look for (ways to spread) evil and terror in the land (through oppression, accumulation of wealth and exploitation). Surely, Allah does not like those who violate peace.’"
The Story,28,78,He said: ‘(Why should I spend this capital for the good of people and society?) This wealth has been given to me only on the basis of (the professional) knowledge and skill I possess.’ Did he not know that Allah had indeed destroyed before him many communities who were far stronger than him in might and far ahead in accumulating (wealth and manpower)? And the culprits will not be questioned (for fact-finding or any excuse or reason) about their sins (at the time of destruction).
The Story,28,79,"Then he went forth before his people, (fully) adorned and ornamented. (Seeing his apparent pomp and show) those who were desirous of worldly life could not help saying: ‘Would that there were such (affluence and riches) for us (as well) as Qarun (Korah) has been given! Surely, he has a mighty fortune.’"
The Story,28,80,And (on the other side) those who had been granted knowledge (of the truth) said: ‘Woe to you! Allah’s reward is (far) better (than this wealth and adornment) for him who has believed and is committed to pious deeds. But this (reward and compensation) will not be given except to those who keep patience.’
The Story,28,81,"Then We sank him (Qarun [Korah]) and his house into the earth. So except Allah, there was no (such) party that could help him (in saving from the torment). Nor could he stop the torment himself."
The Story,28,82,"And those who were longing for his position and prominence the day before said (feeling sorry and regretful): ‘How amazing! Allah gives abundantly to whom He wills and sparingly (to whom He wills) of His servants. Had Allah not done favour to us, He would have sunk us (too). Ah! (It is now understood) that the disbelievers cannot attain to deliverance.’"
The Story,28,83,(This) is the Home of the Hereafter We have made for such people that seek neither violence and vanity nor mischief in the land. And good end is for the Godfearing.
The Story,28,84,"Whoever brings good, for him is reward better than that; and whoever brings evil, then there is no compensation for the evildoers but equal to what they used to do."
The Story,28,85,"Surely, the (Lord) Who has enjoined (the teaching, preaching and establishment of the system given in) the Qur’an upon you will bring you back (according to your desire) to the place of return (Mecca or the Hereafter with victory and success). Say: ‘My Lord knows best the one who brought guidance and (also) the one who is in open error.’*"
The Story,28,86,"(The Muslim Umma [Community] is addressed through the Prophet, blessings and peace be upon him:) And you did not expect that this (Book) will be revealed to you, but it is (revealed by) the mercy of your Lord. So never be a helper of the disbelievers."
The Story,28,87,"And never let these (disbelievers) turn you away from (implementing and preaching of) the Revelations of Allah after they have been sent down to you. And keep calling (the people) towards your Lord, and never become of those who associate partners with Allah."
The Story,28,88,And never worship any other (self-made) god besides Allah. None has the right to be worshipped except He. Everything has to perish but He. His is the command and to Him you (all) will be returned.
The Spider,29,1,"Alif, Lam, Mim. (Only Allah and the Messenger [blessings and peace be upon him] know the real meaning.)"
The Spider,29,2,"Do people think that they will be released (just) on saying: ‘We have believed,’ and they will not be tried?"
The Spider,29,3,"And surely, We tried (also) those who were before them. Allah will certainly show up (through trial) those who are truthful (in claiming beliefs), and shall make the liars (as well) stand out."
The Spider,29,4,Do the evildoers think that they will slip away from Our (grip)? How evil is what they decide (in their minds)!
The Spider,29,5,"Whoever hopes for meeting with Allah, then Allah’s appointed time is bound to come. And He alone is All-Hearing, All-Knowing."
The Spider,29,6,"And whoever strives hard (for the cause of truth) strives for his own (benefit). Surely, Allah is independent of (the obedience, submission and struggles) of all the worlds."
The Spider,29,7,"And those who believe and do pious deeds, We shall remove all their misdeeds from their (record), and We shall certainly give them a reward better than the deeds which they will have (actually) accomplished."
The Spider,29,8,"And We have enjoined upon man to behave benevolently with his parents. And if they contend with you that you should associate (others) with Me, of which you have no knowledge, then do not obey them. To Me you (all) have to return. So I shall inform you of (the deeds) which you used to do (in the world)."
The Spider,29,9,"And those who believe and do pious deeds, then We shall certainly admit them to the (group) of the most pious."
The Spider,29,10,"And there are (also) those amongst the people who say: ‘We believe in Allah,’ but when they are put to (some) trouble in the way of Allah, they consider the trial of the people like punishment from Allah. And if some help comes from your Lord, then indeed they start saying: ‘We were with you.’ Is Allah not best aware of those (things) which are (hidden) in the breasts of all the people of the world?"
The Spider,29,11,"And surely, Allah will distinguish those who have believed (with true hearts) and will certainly expose the hypocrites (too)."
The Spider,29,12,"And the disbelievers say to the believers: ‘Follow our way and we shall bear (the burden of) your sins,’ whereas they will not bear any (burden) of their sins. Surely, they are liars."
The Spider,29,13,"And they will certainly carry their own burdens (of sins), and (will also have loaded) many (other) burdens (over themselves) along with their own burdens. And they will certainly be interrogated on the Day of Resurrection about those (false allegations) which they used to invent."
The Spider,29,14,And indeed We sent Nuh (Noah) to his people. He lived amongst them for a millennium less fifty years. Then the Great Flood seized them whilst they were wrongdoers.
The Spider,29,15,"Then We delivered Nuh (Noah) and those (with him) in the Ark, and made that (Ark and the incident) a sign for the people of the world."
The Spider,29,16,And (remember) Ibrahim (Abraham) when he said to his people: ‘Worship Allah and fear Him. That is better for you if you know (the reality).
The Spider,29,17,"You worship idols besides Allah and fabricate mere lies. Surely, those you worship instead of Allah are not masters of your sustenance. So always seek sustenance from Allah, and worship Him alone, and give thanks to Him. You will be returned to Him alone."
The Spider,29,18,"And if you reject (my words), then no doubt many generations have rejected (the truth) before as well. And nothing is (obligatory) upon the Messenger but to convey (the commandments) in a clear way.’"
The Spider,29,19,"Have they not seen (i.e., pondered) how Allah originates creation, then repeats it (the same way)? Surely, this is easy for Allah."
The Spider,29,20,"Say: ‘Travel in the land (to study life in the universe), then observe (i.e., meditate and research) as to how He initiated (the life of) Creation and how He raises and nourishes the second life (passing it through evolutionary stages). Surely, Allah has perfect power over all things."
The Spider,29,21,He torments whom He wills and shows mercy to whom He pleases. And to Him will you be returned.
The Spider,29,22,"And you can escape (from Allah) neither in the earth nor in the heavens, nor is there for you any guardian or helper except Allah."
The Spider,29,23,"And those who reject Allah’s Revelations and deny meeting with Him, they despair of My mercy. And it is they for whom there is painful punishment."
The Spider,29,24,"So the people of Ibrahim (Abraham) had no answer except that they said: ‘Kill him or burn him.’ Then Allah delivered him from the fire (of Nimrod). Surely, there are signs in this incident for those who have believed."
The Spider,29,25,"And Ibrahim (Abraham) said: ‘You have taken up the worship of idols leaving Allah merely for the sake of mutual friendship in the life of this world. Then, on the Day of Resurrection, (each) one of you will deny (the friendship of) the other and (each) one of you will curse the other. And Hell is your abode and there will be no helper for you."
The Spider,29,26,"Then Lut (Lot) believed in him (Ibrahim [Abraham]) and he said: ‘I am migrating towards my Lord. Surely, He is Almighty, Most Wise.’"
The Spider,29,27,"And We blessed him with Ishaq (Isaac) and Ya‘qub ([Jacob], a son and a grandson,) and We ordained Prophethood and the Book in Ibrahim’s (Abraham’s) descendants. And We gave him his reward (here) in this world, and surely he is amongst the most pious in the Hereafter (as well)."
The Spider,29,28,"And (remember) Lut (Lot) when he said to his people: ‘Surely, you commit the worst indecency. None of the nations in the whole world has ever committed this (indecency) before you."
The Spider,29,29,Do you approach men (for your sexual desire) and commit highway robberies and do indecent deeds in your (crowded) meetings?’ And his people (also) had no answer except that they said: ‘Bring Allah’s torment upon us if you are truthful.’
The Spider,29,30,Lut (Lot) submitted: ‘O Lord! Help me against the mischief mongers.’
The Spider,29,31,"And when Our messengers (angels) came to Ibrahim (Abraham) with good news (then, adding,) they (also) said: ‘We are going to destroy the dwellers of this town because its inhabitants are the wrongdoers.’"
The Spider,29,32,Ibrahim (Abraham) said: ‘Lut (Lot) is (also) here in this (town).’ They said: ‘We know very well the people who (live) in it. We shall certainly save Lut (Lot) and his family except his wife. She is of those who remain behind.’
The Spider,29,33,"And when Our messengers (angels) came to Lut (Lot), he felt distressed (on their arrival) and felt depressed for their (intention to torment). And (the messengers) said: ‘Do not feel afraid or grieved. We shall no doubt save you and your family except your wife. She is of those who will remain behind (for torment)."
The Spider,29,34,"Surely, we are about to bring down from the heaven torment for the inhabitants of this town because they used to disobey.’"
The Spider,29,35,"And verily, We sustained (the ruined houses) of this town as a clear sign for the wise."
The Spider,29,36,"And (We sent) to Madyan their (kinship) brother Shu‘ayb. So he said: ‘O my people, worship Allah and look forward to the Last Day and do not do mischief in the land.’"
The Spider,29,37,"Then they rejected Shu‘ayb. So (the torment of) the earthquake seized them (as well), and at dawn they were lying prone (dead) in their houses."
The Spider,29,38,"And (We destroyed) ‘Ad and Thamud (as well). And indeed (ruins of) some of their houses stand out (i.e., have lived to tell the tale) for you (as a lesson of warning). And Satan made their evil deeds look charming to them, and turned them away from the path (of truth) though they were vigilant and wise."
The Spider,29,39,"And (We also destroyed) Qarun (Korah), Pharaoh and Haman. And surely, Musa (Moses) brought them clear signs and they were arrogant and violent in the land but could not escape (Our seizure)."
The Spider,29,40,"So We seized (every one of) them for his sin. And there was (a faction) of those against whom We sent a storm of pelting stones. And of them was (also a group) whom a roaring blast seized. And (a party) of them were such whom We sank into the earth. And of them there was (yet another community) that We drowned. And Allah would never have wronged them, but they themselves wronged their own souls ."
The Spider,29,41,"The example of those (disbelievers) who have taken others (i.e., idols) as guardians instead of Allah is like the story of a spider who builds (for herself) a house (of cobweb). And no doubt the weakest of all houses is the spider’s house. Would that they knew it!"
The Spider,29,42,"Surely, Allah knows (the truth of the idols) that they worship instead of Him and He alone is Almighty, Most Wise."
The Spider,29,43,"And these are the examples We explain for the people (to understand), and none understands them except those who have knowledge."
The Spider,29,44,"Allah has created the heavens and the earth with a decreed celestial order. Surely, there is in this (creation) a sign (of His Oneness and Might) for those who believe."
The Spider,29,45,"(O Esteemed Beloved!) Recite the Book which has been revealed to you and establish prayer. Surely, prayer prohibits indecency and impiety; and verily, the remembrance of Allah is the greatest. And Allah knows whatever (deeds) you do."
The Spider,29,46,"And, (O believers,) do not argue with the People of the Book but in a suitable and decent way, except those of them who did injustice. And say (to them): ‘We believe in that (Book) which has been revealed to us and which was sent down to you, and our God and your God is but One and we obey Him alone.’"
The Spider,29,47,"And in like manner, We revealed the Book to you. And those (knowers of the truth) whom We had given the Book (already) believe in this (Book). And of these (inhabitants of Mecca too) there are those who believe in it. And none but the disbelievers deny Our Revelations."
The Spider,29,48,"And, (O Beloved,) you never recited any book before this, nor did you write it with your own hand in which case the disbelievers would certainly have doubted."
The Spider,29,49,But these are the clear Verses (of the Qur’an) that are (preserved) in the breasts of those who have been given (true) knowledge. And none other than the unjust deny Our Revelations.
The Spider,29,50,And the disbelievers say: ‘Why have signs not been sent down on him (the Holy Prophet [blessings and peace be upon him]) from his Lord?’ Say: ‘The signs are with Allah alone and I am simply an open Warner.’
The Spider,29,51,"Is this (sign) not enough for them that We have revealed to you (that) Book which is recited to them (or will always be recited)? Surely, in this (Book) there is mercy and direction and guidance for the believers."
The Spider,29,52,"Say: ‘Sufficient is Allah as a Witness between me and you. He knows (the state of) all that is in the heavens and in the earth. And those who believe in falsehood and disbelieve in Allah, it is they who are the losers.’"
The Spider,29,53,"And they want you to hasten the torment. And had the time (of the torment) not been fixed, the torment would have overtaken them. And that (torment, or the time of the torment,) shall certainly come upon them all of a sudden and they will not be aware (of it)."
The Spider,29,54,"They seek the torment from you in haste, and surely Hell is about to besiege the disbelievers."
The Spider,29,55,"The Day when the torment wraps them from above them and from beneath their feet, Allah will say: ‘Savour the taste of works you used to perform.’"
The Spider,29,56,"O My servants who have believed! Surely, My earth is vast, so worship Me alone."
The Spider,29,57,Every soul is to taste death and then to Us you will be returned.
The Spider,29,58,"And those who believe and persevere with right actions, We shall certainly house them in the upper palaces of Paradise with streams flowing beneath them; they will live there forever. What an excellent reward for those who do (constructive) works!"
The Spider,29,59,(These are the people) who remain steadfast and always trust their Lord alone.
The Spider,29,60,"And many an animal there is that does not carry its sustenance (with it)! Allah provides for them and for you too. And He is All-Hearing, All-Knowing."
The Spider,29,61,And if you ask these (disbelievers): ‘Who created the heavens and the earth and made the sun and the moon law-abiding?’ they will certainly say: ‘Allah.’ Then where are they turning away?
The Spider,29,62,"Allah increases sustenance for whom He pleases of His servants and restrains for whom He wills. Surely, Allah knows everything full well."
The Spider,29,63,"And if you ask them: ‘Who sends down water from the sky, then gives life (and freshness) to the earth after its death?’ they will surely say: ‘Allah.’ Say: ‘All praise belongs to Allah alone.’ But most of them do not have sense."
The Spider,29,64,"And, (O people,) the life of this world is nothing but sport and pastime and the Home of the Hereafter is the only (true) life. Would that they knew (this secret)!"
The Spider,29,65,"When they board a vessel they (abandon the idols in hard times and) call upon Allah alone, making their Din (faith and devotion) sincerely (and purely) for Him. Then, when Allah rescues and brings them safe to the land, they start setting up partners with Him (again),"
The Spider,29,66,So that they may show ingratitude towards that (favour of deliverance) which We granted them and enjoy (the unlawful) benefits (of the life of disbelief). But soon they will know (their fate).
The Spider,29,67,"And have they not seen that We have made the Sanctuary (of the Ka‘ba) a safe haven while people are abducted from all around them? Do they (still) believe in falsehood, and will they continue disregarding the favour of Allah?"
The Spider,29,68,And who can be more unjust than someone who fabricates a lie concerning Allah or belies the truth when it comes to him? Is there not an apartment in Hell (appointed) for the disbelievers?
The Spider,29,69,"And those who strive hard (and struggle against the lower self vehemently) for Our cause, We certainly guide them to Our ways, and verily Allah blesses the men of spiritual excellence with His companionship."
The Romans,30,1,"Alif, Lam, Mim. (Only Allah and the Messenger [blessings and peace be upon him] know the real meaning.)"
The Romans,30,2,"The Romans have been overpowered (by Persia),"
The Romans,30,3,"In the land nearby. And after their defeat they will soon gain victory,"
The Romans,30,4,"In a few years (i.e., in less than a decade). The command is but Allah’s both before (in the Persian dominance) and afterwards too (in the Roman dominance). And the believers will rejoice on that day,"
The Romans,30,5,"With the help of Allah. He helps whom He wills and He is Almighty, Ever-Merciful."
The Romans,30,6,(This) is the promise of Allah. Allah does not go against His promise but most people do not know.
The Romans,30,7,"They know only the visible worldly life, and they are neglectful and unaware of (the real life of) the Hereafter."
The Romans,30,8,"Have they not meditated within themselves that Allah has not created the heavens and the earth and whatever is between the two except with (a system of) truth and for a fixed term? And surely, most of the people do not believe in the meeting with their Lord."
The Romans,30,9,"Have they not travelled in the earth and seen what was the end of those before them? They were more powerful than them. And they cultivated the earth, and inhabited it far more than these people have done. Then their Messengers came to them with clear signs. So Allah would not wrong them but they wronged their souls themselves."
The Romans,30,10,Then much evil came to be the end of those who did evil because they used to belie the Revelations of Allah and used to ridicule them.
The Romans,30,11,"Allah generates creation the first time, then (He is the One Who) will create it the second time, then to Him you will be returned."
The Romans,30,12,"And the Day when the Last Hour is established, the evildoers will lose hope."
The Romans,30,13,"And none of their (self-made) partners will intercede for them, and (ultimately) they will deny their very same partners."
The Romans,30,14,"And the Day when the Last Hour will be established, people will separate from one another (in personal agony)."
The Romans,30,15,So those who believe and always do pious deeds will be pleased and delighted in the Gardens of Paradise.
The Romans,30,16,"And those who disbelieve and belie Our Revelations and the meeting of the Last Day, it is they who will be brought forth to the torment."
The Romans,30,17,So glorify Allah when you enter the evening (Maghrib and ‘Isha’ times) and when you enter the morning (Fajr time).
The Romans,30,18,"And all praise in the heavens and the earth be to Him alone, and (glorify Him) in the afternoon (‘Asr time) and at noon (Zuhr time) as well."
The Romans,30,19,"He is the One Who brings forth the living from the dead, and brings forth the dead from the living, and enlivens and freshens the earth after its death. And you (too) will be brought forth (from the graves) the same way."
The Romans,30,20,"And of His signs is that He created you from dust, and now you are human beings spread around (all over the globe)."
The Romans,30,21,"And (also) of His signs is that He created for you mates of your own kind so that you acquire peace from them, and He created between you love and mercy. Verily, in this (system of creation) there are signs for those who meditate."
The Romans,30,22,"And of His signs (too) is the creation of the heavens and the earth and (also) the diversity of your tongues and colours. Verily, in that are signs for the men of knowledge (and research)."
The Romans,30,23,"And (also) of His signs is your sleep by night and by day and your looking for His bounty (i.e., sustenance). Verily, there are signs in it for the (active) listeners."
The Romans,30,24,"And amongst His signs (as well) is that He shows you lightning to make you fear and hope and pours (rain)water from the sky. Then with that, He brings the earth back to life and liveliness after it dies. Verily, there are signs in it for those who put their mind to work."
The Romans,30,25,"And (also) of His signs is that the heavens and the earth stand firm by His (system of) command. Then, when He will give you one call to come (forth) from the earth, at once you will come (forth)."
The Romans,30,26,And whatever is in the heavens and the earth (all) belongs to Him alone. All are obedient and submissive to Him alone.
The Romans,30,27,"And He is the One Who originates creation, then will regenerate it and this (recreation) is very easy for Him. His is the highest Glory in the heavens and the earth and He is Almighty, Most Wise."
The Romans,30,28,"(To bring home the point of the Oneness of God) He has illustrated an example for you from your personal lives: Are those (slaves), whom you possess, your partners in the wealth which We have given you, that you (all) become equal sharers (owners? Moreover, do) you fear them as you fear one another? (No,) We explain the signs expressly in the same way for those who possess wisdom (that there is no partner of Allah also in His creation)."
The Romans,30,29,But those who have done injustice follow the desires of their (ill-commanding) selves without any knowledge (and guidance). So who can guide him whom Allah has held astray? And there are no helpers for them.
The Romans,30,30,So set your face with absolute concentration (and single-minded devotion) to the obedience of Allah. The nature (made) by Allah is (Islam) on which He has created mankind. (Adopt it. The instinct) created by Allah will never be changed. This Din (Religion) is straight but most people do not know (these realities).
The Romans,30,31,Have your mind set in turning towards Him alone in repentance and remorse and fear Him and establish Prayer and be not of the polytheists.
The Romans,30,32,(Also be not) of those (Jews and Christians) who divided up their religion and became sects and subsects—every sect rejoicing over what is with them.
The Romans,30,33,"And when suffering afflicts people, they call upon their Lord turning towards Him, but when He delights them with the taste of mercy from Him, then some of them straight away start setting up partners with their Lord,"
The Romans,30,34,"To show ingratitude for the bounty which We have given them. So enjoy benefits (of a few days’ life), then soon you will know (your end)."
The Romans,30,35,Have We sent down to them any (such) authority that speaks as a witness in favour of these idols they associate as partners with Allah?
The Romans,30,36,"And when We delight people with the taste of mercy, they cheer up with that, and when some suffering touches them due to the sins they have already perpetrated, they lose hope at once."
The Romans,30,37,"Have they not seen that Allah releases sustenance in abundance for whom He wills and restrains it (for whom He likes)? Surely, there are signs in it for those who believe."
The Romans,30,38,So keep giving to the close relative his due and to the needy and the wayfarers (their due). That is best for those who seek the pleasure of Allah and it is they who will achieve the goal.
The Romans,30,39,"And the money that you lend as usury so that (your wealth) may increase through mingling with other people’s money will not increase with Allah, but the money that you give as Zakat ([the obligatory Alms-due] and charity donations), seeking (solely) Allah’s pleasure—so it is they who multiply (their money with Allah) manifold."
The Romans,30,40,"Allah is the One Who created you, then granted you sustenance, then causes you to die and then will bring you back to life. Is there any of your (self-made) partners who may do any of these (works)? Holy is He (Allah) the Glorious, the Transcendent, far above these things which they associate as partners (with Him)."
The Romans,30,41,Corruption and disorder has spread over land and sea on account of (the sins) which people have earned with their hands so that Allah makes them taste the outcome of some of their (evil) deeds that they have committed in order that they may desist.
The Romans,30,42,"Say: ‘Travel in the land, then see how (alarming) was the end of the people before you! Most of them were polytheists.’"
The Romans,30,43,So set your (radiant) face to the straight Din (Religion) before that Day comes from Allah which will not avert (at all). On that Day people will separate from one another.
The Romans,30,44,"Whoever disbelieves will himself face the (evil consequences) of disbelief, whilst those who act piously are setting aright for themselves the places of rest (in Paradise),"
The Romans,30,45,"So that Allah rewards out of His bounty those who believe and do good deeds. Surely, He does not take the disbelievers for friends."
The Romans,30,46,"And (also) of His signs is that He sends winds that bring glad tidings (of rain), so that He blesses you with His mercy (in the shape of the results of rain) and that the ships may (also) sail with His command (by means of these winds). And (all this) is because you may seek His bounty (in the form of agriculture and business) and you may (thus) become thankful."
The Romans,30,47,"And in fact We sent before you Messengers to their respective peoples and they came to them with clear Signs. Then We took revenge on the wicked (who belied and disbelieved), and to help the believers was (and is) a binding obligation upon Our Grace."
The Romans,30,48,"Allah is the One Who sends the winds and they raise the clouds. Then He spreads this (cloud) in the atmosphere in the sky as He likes. Then He breaks it up into (various) pieces (layer upon layer). Then you see the rain pouring down from its midst. Then, when He sends it to those of His servants whom He pleases, they become instantly cheerful,"
The Romans,30,49,Although they were in despair before the rainfall upon them.
The Romans,30,50,"So see the effects of Allah’s mercy how He gives life to the earth after its death! Surely, He will bring the dead back to life (in the same way) and He is All-Powerful over everything."
The Romans,30,51,"And if We send a dry wind and they see (their) crops turning yellow, then after this they will start denying (all the earlier favours)."
The Romans,30,52,"(O Beloved!) Surely, you make neither the dead (i.e., the disbelievers deprived of the vitality of faith) hear your call nor the deaf (i.e., deprived of hearing the call of truth) whilst they are getting away (from you) turning their backs.*"
The Romans,30,53,"Nor can you turn (these) blind (i.e., wanting in insight) from misguidance to the path of guidance. You recite (with the essential understanding and competence of acceptability) only to those people who believe in Our Revelations. So it is they who are Muslims. (You recite to none except them.)"
The Romans,30,54,"Allah is the One Who created you from a weak thing (i.e., a sperm drop). Then after weakness He generated strength (of youth). Then after strength He produced debility and senility. He creates what He wills, and He is All-Knowing, All-Powerful."
The Romans,30,55,"And the Day when the Last Hour is established, the evildoers will swear they did not stay (in the world) for more than an hour. They used to turn back (from truth) in the same manner (in the world as well)."
The Romans,30,56,"And those blessed with knowledge and faith will say (to them): ‘Indeed, according to the Book of Allah, you have stayed till the Day of Resurrection (instead of one hour). So this is the Day of Resurrection but you did not know it.’"
The Romans,30,57,"So on that Day, the excuse of the wrongdoers will not be of any benefit to them, nor will they be asked to please (Allah)."
The Romans,30,58,"And in truth We have elucidated every type of example in this Qur’an for the people (to make them understand). And if you bring them some (visible) sign, even then these disbelieving people will certainly say: ‘You are only doing falsehood and fraud.’"
The Romans,30,59,"That is how Allah seals the hearts of the people who do not know (the truth, despite it becomes evident)."
The Romans,30,60,"So be steadfast. Verily, the promise of Allah is true. And let not those who lack certitude of faith enfeeble you (on account of the grief over their straying and discomfort for their guidance. O life of the universe, let not their disbelief become a grief consuming your soul)."
Luqmân,31,1,"Alif, Lam, Mim. (Only Allah and the Messenger [blessings and peace be upon him] know the real meaning.)"
Luqmân,31,2,"These are Verses of the Book of Wisdom,"
Luqmân,31,3,"Guidance and mercy for the pious,"
Luqmân,31,4,Who establish Prayer and pay Zakat (the Alms-due) and those who believe in the Hereafter.
Luqmân,31,5,It is they who are following guidance from their Lord and it is they who will prosper.
Luqmân,31,6,And of people there are those who buy absurd narrations to make the people lacking in knowledge lose the path of Allah and to mock this (path). It is they for whom there is painful torment.
Luqmân,31,7,"And when Our Revelations are recited to such a one, he turns his face away showing arrogance as though he had not heard it at all, as if there were weight (of deafness) in his ears. So give him the news of an agonizing torment."
Luqmân,31,8,"Undoubtedly, those who believe and keep doing good deeds, for them are Gardens of Bliss."
Luqmân,31,9,"(They) will live in them forever. The promise of Allah is true. And He is Almighty, Most Wise."
Luqmân,31,10,"He created the heavens without pillars (as) you see them and He placed firm mountains in the earth so that it might not quake carrying you (during rotation) and He spread in it all kinds of animals. And We sent down water from the heaven, and We caused to grow in it all kinds of fine and useful vegetation."
Luqmân,31,11,"This is Allah’s Creation. So, (O polytheists,) show Me what others, apart from Allah, have created. In truth, the wrongdoers are in open error."
Luqmân,31,12,"And surely, We blessed Luqman with wisdom and sound judgment (and said to him:) ‘Be grateful to Allah. And whoever gives thanks gives thanks for his own good; and whoever shows ingratitude, then surely Allah is Self-Sufficient, Worthy of all praise.’"
Luqmân,31,13,"And (recall) when Luqman said to his son as he was advising him: ‘O my son, do not set up partners with Allah. Verily, associating partners with Allah is a very grave injustice.’"
Luqmân,31,14,"And We emphatically enjoined upon man (to do good) to his parents—whose mother bore him (in her reproductive system) in pain after pain, and whose weaning also takes two years (and commanded him:) ‘Give thanks to Me and to your parents. (You) shall return to Me alone.’"
Luqmân,31,15,"And if both of them contend with you that you should associate (others) with Me, of which you have no knowledge, then do not obey them. And cooperate with them in worldly affairs in a decent manner. But (in the matter of faith and the Last Hour and the related affairs) follow someone who adopts the path of turning to Me in repentance and submitting to My injunctions. Then you are to return to Me alone. So I shall inform you about the works that you used to do.’"
Luqmân,31,16,"(Luqman said:) ‘O my son, if there is a thing equal to the grain of a mustard seed (hidden) inside a rock or in the heavens or in the earth, (even then) Allah will bring it forth (for reckoning on the Day of Judgment). Surely, Allah is the Subtle Knower of the minutest matters, All-Aware and Most Vigilant (as well)."
Luqmân,31,17,"O my son! Establish Prayer and enjoin good and forbid evil, and patiently endure every suffering that touches you. Verily, these are matters of great courage and high resolve."
Luqmân,31,18,"And do not turn your face away from the people (in arrogance), nor walk haughtily on earth. Surely, Allah does not love the arrogant one who walks gloatingly in self-conceit."
Luqmân,31,19,"And adopt moderation whilst walking and keep your voice low. Surely, the worst voice is the bray of a donkey.’"
Luqmân,31,20,"(O people!) Have you not seen that Allah has subjected to you whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth, and He has completed upon you His blessings outwardly as well as inwardly? And amongst people there are (also) those who dispute about Allah without knowledge and without guidance and without (any evidence from) the enlightening Book."
Luqmân,31,21,"And when it is said to them: ‘Follow this Book which Allah has revealed,’ they say: ‘Nay, we shall follow (that) way which we found our fathers following,’ even though Satan should be inviting them to the torment of Hell."
Luqmân,31,22,"And whoever bows his face in obedience to Allah, and is also a man of spiritual excellence (in action and state of mind), has firmly grasped a strong handhold. And the end of all deeds returns to Allah alone."
Luqmân,31,23,"And whoever disbelieves, (O Esteemed Beloved,) let not his disbelief grieve you. They (too) are to return to Us. We shall inform them of the deeds which they used to do. Surely, Allah knows best the (hidden) contents of the breasts."
Luqmân,31,24,"We shall provide them a little benefit (in the world) then, making them helpless, We shall drive them towards the severe torment."
Luqmân,31,25,And if you ask them: ‘Who created the heavens and the earth?’ they shall answer: ‘Allah.’ Say: ‘All praise belongs to Allah alone.’ But most of them do not know.
Luqmân,31,26,"Whatever is in the heavens and the earth (all) belongs to Allah alone. Surely, Allah is Self-Sufficient, Worthy of all praise (by Himself)."
Luqmân,31,27,"And if (all) the trees on earth were pens, and the ocean reinforced by seven more oceans were ink, even then the Words of Allah would never be exhausted. Surely, Allah is Almighty, Most Wise."
Luqmân,31,28,"Creating you all and raising you all (after death) is (in Allah’s power) like (creating and raising) a single person. Surely, Allah is All-Hearing, All-Seeing."
Luqmân,31,29,"Have you not seen that Allah makes the night pass into the day and makes the day pass into the night; and (He is the One Who) has made the sun and the moon subservient, each rotating for an appointed term and that Allah is Aware of (all) the deeds that you do?"
Luqmân,31,30,"That is because Allah alone is the truth and those whom these people worship besides Allah are false and because Allah is Most High, the Supreme."
Luqmân,31,31,"Have you not seen that vessels sail on the sea by Allah’s bounty so that He shows you some of His signs? Surely, there are signs in it for every greatly steadfast and grateful person."
Luqmân,31,32,"And when the sea wave engulfs them like (clouds or towering mountains or) canopies, they (the disbelievers and polytheists) start calling upon Allah, dedicating their most sincere devotion to Him alone. But when rescuing them He brings them back to land, then only a few of them remain on the moderate path (i.e., the path of guidance). And none but every deceptive and ungrateful person denies Our signs."
Luqmân,31,33,"O people! Fear your Lord and fear that Day when no father will be able to expiate for his son, nor will a son be able to atone for his father. Surely, the promise of Allah is true. So let not the worldly life deceive you, nor let the Arch-Deceiver (Satan) deceive you concerning Allah."
Luqmân,31,34,"Surely, Allah is the One with Whom is the knowledge of the Last Hour. And He is the One Who sends down rain and knows whatever is in the wombs. And no one knows what (deed) he will earn the next day, nor does anyone know in what land he will die. Surely, Allah is All-Knowing, All-Aware (i.e., Self-Knowing and fully Aware of everything besides Him. He Himself knows everything and also informs him whom He likes)."
The Prostration,32,1,"Alif, Lam, Mim. (Only Allah and the Messenger [blessings and peace be upon him] know the real meaning.)"
The Prostration,32,2,There is not even an iota of doubt in it that sending down of this Book is from the Lord of all the worlds.
The Prostration,32,3,"Do the disbelievers and the polytheists say: ‘He (the Holy Prophet) has fabricated it’? Nay, it is the truth from your Lord so that you may warn those to whom no Warner has come before you that they may receive guidance."
The Prostration,32,4,"Allah is He Who created the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them in six days (i.e., six phases). He then established His authority on the Throne (of command and control system of the universe, befitting His glory). You have no helper or intercessor apart from Him. So do you not accept direction and guidance?"
The Prostration,32,5,He plans and executes the command and control system from the heavens to the earth. Then His command ascends (and will ascend to completion) towards Him in one Day which measures one thousand years according to (the number) that you count.
The Prostration,32,6,"He is the One Who knows the invisible and the visible, Almighty and Ever-Merciful."
The Prostration,32,7,"He is the One Who endowed everything He created with perfection and virtue. And He initiated the genesis of man from clay (i.e., inorganic matter);*"
The Prostration,32,8,Then He reared his lineage from the extract of a worthless fluid (a sperm drop);
The Prostration,32,9,"Then He perfected (organs and limbs in) him and breathed into him of His spirit (i.e., life) and made for you (also in the mother’s womb) ears and (then) eyes and (then) heart and brain. You give thanks but little."
The Prostration,32,10,"And the disbelievers say: ‘When we are lost in the earth, shall we then be created anew?’ In fact, they deny the meeting with their Lord."
The Prostration,32,11,"Say: ‘The angel of death, that is appointed over you, will terminate your life. Then you will be sent back to your Lord.’"
The Prostration,32,12,"And (you will wonder at them) if you see the sinners hanging down their heads before the presence of their Lord (and saying:) ‘O our Lord, we have seen and heard, so send us back (to the world now) so that we do pious deeds. Surely, we believe with certitude.’"
The Prostration,32,13,"And had We intended, We would have given guidance to every soul (Ourselves), but this command from Me has been confirmed: I will certainly fill Hell with all the (disbelieving) jinn and mankind."
The Prostration,32,14,"So (now) savour the taste that you had forgotten your meeting of this Day. Surely, We have forgotten you. And enjoy the flavour of everlasting torment, a reward for your deeds which you used to do."
The Prostration,32,15,"So only those who believe in Our Revelations, when directed and guided by means of these (Verses), fall down prostrating themselves and glorify their Lord with praise. And they do not behave with arrogance."
The Prostration,32,16,Their sides stay away from their beds and they call out to their Lord in a (mingled state) of fear and hope and spend (in Our way) out of the sustenance We have provided them.
The Prostration,32,17,So no one knows what coolness of eyes is kept hidden for them. This will be a reward for those (pious deeds) which they used to do.
The Prostration,32,18,"How can a person who is a believer be like him who is disobedient? (Nay,) they (both) cannot be equal."
The Prostration,32,19,"So those who believe and keep doing good deeds, for them are Gardens of eternal repose as an entertainment and honour (from their Lord) in reward for those (works) which they used to do."
The Prostration,32,20,"But as for those who disobeyed, their abode is Hell. Every time they will intend to get out of it and escape, they will be turned back into it and it will be said to them: ‘Keep enjoying the taste of this Fire of Hell which you used to belie.’"
The Prostration,32,21,"And surely, before the major torment (of the Hereafter), We shall make them savour the (taste of) nearby torment (in this world) so that they abstain (from disbelief)."
The Prostration,32,22,"And who is a greater wrongdoer than someone who is admonished by means of Revelations of His Lord, and then he turns away from them? Surely, We take revenge on the evildoers."
The Prostration,32,23,"And verily, We gave Musa (Moses) the Book (Torah). So do not have any doubt with regard to his meeting. (That meeting is about to take place during the Night of the Ascension.) And We made it a guidance for the Children of Israel."
The Prostration,32,24,And We made from amongst them authorities and leaders who kept disseminating guidance by Our command when they persevered with patience and believed in Our Revelations with certitude.
The Prostration,32,25,"Surely, your Lord alone will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning matters in which they used to disagree."
The Prostration,32,26,"And have they not taken any guidance (from this proclamation) that how many generations We have destroyed before them in whose dwellings these people (now) move about? Surely, there are signs in it. So do they not hear?"
The Prostration,32,27,"And have they not seen that We stream water towards the dry land, then with that We produce crops of which their cattle as well as they themselves eat? Do they not observe?"
The Prostration,32,28,And they say: ‘When will this (Day of) Judgment take place if you are truthful?’
The Prostration,32,29,"Say: ‘On the Day of Judgment, the belief of disbelievers will bring them no benefit, nor will they be given any respite.’"
The Prostration,32,30,So turn your face away from them and wait and they (too) are waiting.
The Clans,33,1,"O Prophet! Remain firm in fearing Allah (with perseverance as before) and do not agree at all to what the disbelievers and the hypocrites say (i.e., ‘Conclude with us religious agreement’). Surely, Allah is All-Knowing, Most Wise."
The Clans,33,2,"And continue following this (command) which is revealed to you from your Lord. Surely, Allah is Well Aware of the works that you do."
The Clans,33,3,And maintain your trust in Allah and Sufficient is Allah as a Guardian.
The Clans,33,4,"Allah has not made for any man two hearts inside his breast, nor has He made your wives your mothers whom you call mothers by way of zihar (a form of divorce). Nor has He made your adopted sons your (real) sons. These are merely the utterances of your mouth. And Allah says the truth and He alone shows the (straight) path."
The Clans,33,5,"Call them (the adopted sons) after their fathers’ (names). That is most just in the sight of Allah. So if you do not know their fathers, then they are your brothers in the Din (Religion) and your friends. And there is no sin on you for what you said by mistake, but (that will be a sure sin) which your hearts intend. And Allah is Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful."
The Clans,33,6,This (Esteemed) Prophet is nearer to and has a greater claim on the believers than their own souls and his (pure) wives are their mothers. And blood relations have a greater claim one to another (in the distribution of inheritance) in the Book of Allah than (the rest of) the believers and the Emigrants except that you desire to do favour to your friends. This command is written in the Book of Allah.
The Clans,33,7,"And, (O Beloved, recall) when We took a covenant from the Prophets (to preach faith in their Prophethood) and (specially) from you and from Nuh (Noah) and from Ibrahim (Abraham) and Musa (Moses) and ‘Isa (Jesus), the son of Mayam (Mary), and We took from them a solemn covenant,"
The Clans,33,8,So that (Allah) asks the truthful about their truth. And He has prepared an agonizing torment for the disbelievers.
The Clans,33,9,O believers! Recall Allah’s favour to you when the forces (of disbelievers) came upon you. Then We sent wind and troops (of angels) against them whom you did not see. And Allah sees best what you do.
The Clans,33,10,"When they (the disbelievers) invaded you from above (the eastern side of the valley) and from below (the western side of the valley), and when (your) eyes were distracted (with terror), and (your) hearts rose up to your throats (with horror), and you began to think various uncertainties about Allah (in a state of fear and hope),"
The Clans,33,11,"At that stage, the believers were put to trial and were shaken with mighty jolts."
The Clans,33,12,And when the hypocrites and those in whose hearts was a disease (of instability of faith and doubt and suspicion) said: ‘Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peae be upon him) gave us a promise (of victory) just to deceive and betray.’
The Clans,33,13,"And when a party of them said: ‘O people of Yathrib! There is no position left for you to stay (safely), so go back (home),’ and a party of them began to seek permission from the Holy Prophet ([blessings and peace be upon him] to go back), saying: ‘Our houses are lying exposed,’ whereas their houses were not exposed; they only wanted to escape (on this pretext)."
The Clans,33,14,"And if the armies had entered upon them from all the sides of Medina, and they (the hypocrites) had been asked pertaining to the subversion (of disbelief and polytheism), they would have accepted (the demand), and would not have delayed it except for a short while."
The Clans,33,15,And certainly before this they had made a covenant with Allah that they would not turn their backs and run away. And the covenant made with Allah will (certainly) be asked about.
The Clans,33,16,"Say: ‘Escape will not benefit you at all. If you seek to flee (fearing) death or slaughter, you will gain little (from life) except a brief respite.’"
The Clans,33,17,Say: ‘Who is the one that can protect you from Allah if He intends to afflict you with suffering or to bestow upon you His mercy?’ And they will not find for themselves any protector or helper apart from Allah.
The Clans,33,18,"Surely, Allah knows those amongst you who hinder (from the Holy Prophet [blessings and peace be upon him] and from fighting in his company) and who say to their brothers: ‘Come to us.’ And they themselves come to fight but little."
The Clans,33,19,"(They do so) being miserly in your case. But when a fear (situation) arises, you will see them looking at you, their eyes rolling like those of someone fainting into death. But when fear departs, they offend you with sharp tongues (injuring your heart). They are (in a state of feeling) too greedy for spoils of war. (In fact) they have not believed at all. So Allah has annulled all their deeds. And that is easy for Allah."
The Clans,33,20,"They (still) imagine that the disbelievers’ troops have not yet gone (back), and if those troops should come (again), they would wish them join villagers settling as nomads and (conduct surveillance to) collect news about you. And even if they were amongst you, they would not fight except a very few."
The Clans,33,21,"In truth, in (the sacred person of) Allah’s Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) there is for you a most perfect and beautiful model (of life) for every such person that expects and aspires to (meeting) Allah and the Last Day and remembers Allah abundantly."
The Clans,33,22,"And when the believers saw the armies (of disbelievers), they said: ‘This is what Allah and His Messenger promised us, and Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) have spoken the truth.’ So this (spectacle) increased their faith and their commitment to submission to Allah."
The Clans,33,23,"Amongst the believers (a great number of) men proved true what covenant they made with Allah. Of them is someone who has fulfilled his vow (by attaining to martyrdom), and of them is someone who is waiting (for his turn). But they have not changed (their covenant) in the least,"
The Clans,33,24,"That Allah may reward the truthful for their truth and may torment the hypocrites if He wills or may accept their repentance. Surely, Allah is Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful."
The Clans,33,25,"And Allah repulsed the disbelievers (from Medina, defeated,) with the burning of their rage, for they failed to achieve any success. And Allah was Sufficient for the believers in the battle (of al-Ahzab [the Confederates]). And Allah is Ever-Strong, All-Powerful."
The Clans,33,26,"And the People of the Book (amongst the tribe of Banu Qurayza) who helped those (disbelieving combatants in breach of their peace treaty), Allah (also) brought them down from their fortresses and filled their hearts with the fear (of Islam). You kill a party of them (for their war crimes), and make the other party prisoners of war."
The Clans,33,27,"And He made you the owners of the land, the houses and the wealth and the properties of these (war enemies) and the (captured) territory where you had not even stepped in (before). And Allah has Absolute Power over everything."
The Clans,33,28,"O (Esteemed) Prophet! Say to your wives: ‘If you long for the world and its glitter, then come! I shall make a provision for you and set you free in a handsome manner."
The Clans,33,29,"But if you long for Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) and the abode of the Hereafter, then surely Allah has prepared for the pious amongst you a tremendous reward.’"
The Clans,33,30,"O wives of the (Esteemed) Prophet! Whoever of you commits an obvious indecency, the torment for her will be doubled, and that is very easy for Allah."
The Clans,33,31,"And those of you who remain obedient to Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) and persist in pious works, We shall give them double of their reward and We have prepared for them honourable sustenance (in Paradise)."
The Clans,33,32,"O wives of the Messenger! You are not the like of any of the womenfolk. If you want to remain pious and Godfearing, then be not soft in your speech (whilst talking to men as and when required) lest someone whose heart is diseased (with hypocrisy) should feel inclined with desire. And (always) say words that are pure of any taint of doubt and flexibility."
The Clans,33,33,"And remain in your houses with calm and peace and do not display adornment like that of the days of ignorance and establish prayer and pay Zakat (the Alms-due) and keep obeying Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him). Allah only intends to remove all the impurity of sins from you, O People of the House (of the Prophet, [even a doubt or trace of shortcoming]) and make you absolutely pure and clean by blessing you with (perfect) purity and wholesomeness."
The Clans,33,34,"And always remember the Revelations of Allah and the tradition and wisdom (of the Holy Prophet [blessings and peace be upon him]) which are recited in your homes. Surely, Allah is the Master of subtleties (for His favourite servants—Awliya’) and Well Aware (of all His Creation)."
The Clans,33,35,"Surely, the submissive men and the submissive women, and the believing men and the believing women, and the obedient men and the obedient women, and the truthful men and the truthful women, and the steadfast men and the steadfast women, and the humble men and the humble women, and the men who give alms and the women who give alms, and the men who fast and the women who fast, and the men who guard their chastity and the women who guard their chastity, and the men who remember Allah abundantly and the women who remember Allah very much—Allah has prepared for all of them forgiveness and a mighty reward."
The Clans,33,36,"And neither a believing man nor a believing woman has (this) right that, when Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) have given judgment (or a command) about an affair, they should exercise their own choice in (doing or not doing that) work of theirs. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) certainly loses his way into open error."
The Clans,33,37,"And, (O Beloved, recall) when you said to him whom Allah had favoured and whom you (too) had done a favour: ‘Keep your wife (Zaynab) with you in the bond of marriage and fear Allah.’ And you were keeping that secret* in your heart which Allah was about to reveal. And you had (out of decency) the fear of the (scoffs of) people (in your heart. O Beloved! You need not have cared for people). And Allah alone has a greater right that you should fear Him (and who is more Godfearing than you!) So when (your adopted son) Zayd fulfilled his desire to divorce her, We married her to you so that there is no blame on the believers for (marrying) the wives of their adopted sons, whilst they have no desire for them (after divorce). And carrying out Allah’s command was a must."
The Clans,33,38,And there is no blame on the Prophet in (accomplishing) that duty which Allah has made obligatory for him. And certainly the same has been the way and practice of Allah with those (as well) who have passed away before. And the command of Allah is a decree which has been fulfilled.
The Clans,33,39,"Those (bygone) people used to communicate the messages of Allah, and fear Him, and they were afraid of none but Allah. And Allah is Sufficient as a Reckoner."
The Clans,33,40,"Muhammad (blessings and peace be upon him) is not the father of any of your men, but he is the Messenger of Allah and the Last of the Prophets (ending the chain of the Prophets). And Allah is the Perfect Knower of everything."
The Clans,33,41,O believers! Keep remembering Allah abundantly.
The Clans,33,42,And glorify Him morning and evening.
The Clans,33,43,"He is the One Who sends peace and blessings on you and His angels as well, so that He may take you out of the layers of darkness into the light. And He is Ever-Merciful to the believers."
The Clans,33,44,"On the Day when they (the believers) will meet Him, their gift (of the meeting—greeting) will be: ‘Peace!’ And He has kept ready for them most honourable reward."
The Clans,33,45,"O (Esteemed) Prophet! Surely, We have sent you as a Witness (to the truth and the creation), a Bearer of glad tidings (of the beauty of the Hereafter) and a Warner (of the torment in the Hereafter),"
The Clans,33,46,And (as) an Inviter towards Allah by His command and as a Sun spreading Light.
The Clans,33,47,And give good news to the believers that there is for them Allah’s great bounty (that they are cloaked in the affinity of slavery to the Final Messenger of Allah).
The Clans,33,48,"And never agree to what the disbelievers and the hypocrites say (i.e., ‘Conclude with us a religious agreement’). And disregard their hurtful misbehaviour, and maintain your trust in Allah (with persistence). And Allah alone is Sufficient as a Guardian (in the conflict between truth and falsehood)."
The Clans,33,49,"O believers! When you marry the believing women and then divorce them before you have touched them (i.e., had sexual intercourse with them), then no waiting period is (obligatory) on them for you which you may start counting. So give them some provision, and send them off nicely extending to them kindness."
The Clans,33,50,"O Prophet! Surely, We have made lawful for you those of your wives whom you have paid their dower, and those who are in your possession (according to Allah’s commandments) whom Allah has given you as spoils of war, and the daughters of your paternal uncles, and the daughters of your paternal aunts, and the daughters of your maternal uncles, and the daughters of your maternal aunts who have emigrated with you, and any other believing woman who dedicates herself to the Holy Prophet (for marriage), provided the Holy Prophet (too) has the intention to marry her (so all these are lawful for you. This command is) exclusively for you, not for other believers (of the Umma [Community]). Indeed, We know best what We have prescribed for them (the Muslims) concerning their wives and the slave girls they possess. (But this exclusive command for lawfulness of number of wives in your respect has been given) so that there remains no difficulty for you (in making elaborate arrangements for the education and training of the women of the Muslim Umma [community]). And Allah is Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful."
The Clans,33,51,"(O Prophet! You have a choice) to postpone (the turn of) any (wife) whom you may please from amongst your wives, and keep with you (any of them on priority) whom you may please. And there is no blame on you if you desire her (to be with you) from whom you kept distance (for a while). This makes possible for them cooling their eyes (by seeing you) and they will not remain grieved and they will all feel pleased and delighted for what you have blessed them with. And Allah knows best what is in your hearts and Allah is All-Knowing, Forbearing."
The Clans,33,52,"After that (they have preferred your pleasure and your service to the worldly benefits), it is not lawful for you also (to marry) more women (so that these wives alone may enjoy the distinction of their glory). Nor is it lawful that (in case of divorce to some and regarding it Our command to maintain the present number of wives) you take (into marriage) other wives in their place, even though their beauty (of behaviour, moral conduct and style of preaching Din [Religion]) may seem to you pleasingly excellent. But the slave girl that is in your possession (by Our command is lawful). And Allah is Ever-Watchful over everything."
The Clans,33,53,"O believers! Do not enter the houses of the Holy Prophet (blessings and peace be upon him) unless permission is granted to you for a meal. Nor (reach so early as to) wait for the cooking of the meal. But when you are invited, then enter (at that time). Then, when you have eaten the meal, (get up from there and) disperse without delay, and do not linger on in eagerness for talk. Surely, your (sitting for long in this) manner discomforts the Holy Prophet (blessings and peace be upon him); and he feels reluctant to (ask) you (to leave), but Allah does not hesitate in (saying) the truth. And when you ask them (the pure wives) for something, ask them from behind a curtain. This (regard and nice manner) causes great purity for your hearts and for their hearts. And it is not (at all lawful) for you that you cause inconvenience to the Holy Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace be upon him), nor is this (lawful) that you marry his (pure) wives after him, till the end of time. Surely, it is the most grievous sin in the sight of Allah."
The Clans,33,54,"Whether you disclose something or conceal it, Allah is certainly the Most Perfect Knower of everything."
The Clans,33,55,"There is no sin on them (if they do not veil themselves) from their (real) fathers, and their sons, their brothers, their brothers’ sons, their sisters’ sons, their own (Muslim) women and from those slave girls whom they possess. And keep fearing Allah. Surely, Allah is Witness to and Ever-Watchful over everything."
The Clans,33,56,"Surely, Allah and (all) His angels send blessings and greetings on the Holy Prophet (blessings and peace be upon him). O believers! Invoke blessings on him and salute him with a worthy salutation of peace abundantly (and fervently)."
The Clans,33,57,"Surely, those who offend Allah and His Prophet, Allah curses them in the world and in the Hereafter and He has prepared for them a disgraceful torment."
The Clans,33,58,"And those who hurt the believing men and the believing women without their doing anything (wrong), surely, they bear (themselves) the burden of a false allegation and an open sin."
The Clans,33,59,"O Prophet! Say to your wives, your daughters and the women of believers that, (whilst going out,) they should draw their veils as coverings over them. It is more likely that this way they may be recognized (as pious, free women), and may not be hurt (considered by mistake as roving slave girls). And Allah is Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful."
The Clans,33,60,"If the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is the disease (of malice and insolence against the Holy Prophet [blessings and peace be upon him]) and (likewise) those who spread false rumours in Medina do not desist, then We shall certainly make you overmaster them. Then they will not be able to stay in the neighbourhood of Medina but for a few (days)."
The Clans,33,61,"(These) accursed (militant, terrorist and riotous) people (engaged in violent anti-state conspiracies), wherever found, are to be seized and every one of them to be killed (as punishment for their rebellious activities, making them awful signs, to eliminate the threats to peace once and for all)."
The Clans,33,62,"This practice of Allah has (continued) through generations that have passed before, and you will never find any amendment in the way practised by Allah."
The Clans,33,63,The people ask you about (the Hour of) Resurrection. Say: ‘Its knowledge is with Allah alone. And who has made you aware—it may be that the Last Hour has drawn near?’
The Clans,33,64,"Surely, Allah has cursed the disbelievers and readied for them the Blazing Fire (of Hell)."
The Clans,33,65,They will dwell in it forever. They will find neither any caring friend nor any supporting helper.
The Clans,33,66,"On the Day when their faces will be (repeatedly) turned over in the Fire of Hell, they will say: ‘Alas! Would that we had obeyed Allah and obeyed the Holy Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him)!’"
The Clans,33,67,"And they will say: ‘O our Lord, surely we followed what our chiefs and the influential ones directed, so they turned us away from the (straight) path."
The Clans,33,68,O our Lord! Afflict them with double torment and lay on them a mighty curse.’
The Clans,33,69,O believers! Do not be like those who hurt Musa ([Moses] by means of their denigrating words). So Allah proved him clear of the blames which they levelled against him. And he (Musa [Moses]) had great honour and high standing in the sight of Allah.
The Clans,33,70,O believers! Always fear Allah and say what is correct and straight.
The Clans,33,71,He will set (all) your deeds right for you and will forgive you your sins. And whoever obeys Allah and His Holy Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) will surely achieve a great success.
The Clans,33,72,"Indeed, We offered the trust (of obedience) to the heavens and the earth and the mountains, but they declined to bear this (burden) and felt scared of it, but man took it on. Verily, he is given to wrongdoing (against his own soul), unwise and extremely ignorant (of the consequence of lapse in paying back the trust)."
The Clans,33,73,"(This is) so because Allah torments the hypocrites, men and women, and the polytheists, men and women, and Allah accepts repentance of the believers, men and women. And Allah is Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful."
Saba,34,1,"All praise be to Allah alone to Whom belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth, and to Him belongs praise in the Hereafter (as well). And He is All-Wise, Well Aware."
Saba,34,2,"He knows (all) the things that go into the earth and that come out from it and those that descend from heaven and that ascend to it. And He is Ever-Merciful, Most Forgiving."
Saba,34,3,"And the disbelievers say: ‘The Last Hour will not come upon us.’ Say: ‘Why not? By my Lord, Who is the Knower of the unseen, that is bound to come upon you. Nothing can be out of His sight, not even a dust particle in the heavens or in the earth. Nor is there anything smaller or bigger than an atom but is (recorded) in the light-giving Book (al-Lawh al-Mahfuz),"
Saba,34,4,In order that Allah may recompense in full those who believe and continue doing good deeds. It is they for whom there is forgiveness and an honourable sustenance (for the Last Day).
Saba,34,5,"And those who strived in (opposition to) Our Revelations presuming to frustrate (Us), it is they for whom there is punishment of a highly agonizing torment."
Saba,34,6,"And those who have been given knowledge know that (the Book) which has been revealed to you from your Lord is alone the truth. And that (Book) guides to the path of the Most Exalted in Might, All-Praiseworthy (Lord)."
Saba,34,7,"And the disbelievers say (with the intention to wonder and mock): ‘Shall we tell you of a person who informs you that when you have decomposed completely into dust particles (after death), you will certainly be composed into a new creation?"
Saba,34,8,(Either) he has invented a lie against Allah or he is insane.’ (Nothing of the sort!) The truth is that those who do not believe in the Hereafter are undergoing a torment and are in farthest error.
Saba,34,9,"So have they not seen those (signs) in the heaven and the earth (which have beset them) from their front and from their rear? If We so intended, We would sink them into the earth or let a part of the sky fall upon them. Verily, there is in it a sign for every servant of Allah who turns to Him."
Saba,34,10,"And indeed We bestowed on Dawud (David) a tremendous favour from Our presence (and ordained:) ‘O mountains, join him in chanting melodious tunes (of Our glory and praise).’ And (We gave the same command) to the birds as well (making them subservient). And We made iron soft for him."
Saba,34,11,"(And We commanded:) ‘Make wide and full-length coats of mail and care for the measure while joining (their) links (i.e., rings). And, (O family of Dawud [David],) continue doing pious deeds. I am minutely watching the works that you do.’"
Saba,34,12,"And to Sulayman ([Solomon] We made subservient) the wind whose morning course was a month’s journey and the evening course (too) was a month’s journey. And We caused a spring of molten copper to flow for him, and (made subservient to him) some jinn who worked in front of him by the command of his Lord. And (We had warned that) whoever of them turned away from Our command, We would make him taste the Blazing Fire of Hell."
Saba,34,13,They (the jinn) used to make for him whatever he desired of lofty and strong fortresses and statues and basins large as reservoirs looking like huge cauldrons fixed in their places. O family of Dawud (David)! Keep giving thanks (to Allah). And very few of My servants have been grateful!
Saba,34,14,"And when We decreed Sulayman’s (Solomon’s) death, nothing made them (the jinn) aware of his death except a termite of the earth which kept eating his staff. Then, when his body came to the ground, it became known to the jinn that if they had known the unseen, they would not have been in that humiliating torment."
Saba,34,15,"In fact, for (the people of) Saba (Sheba), a sign did exist in their homeland itself. (They) were two gardens, one on the right hand and the other on the left. (They were commanded:) ‘Eat of the provision from your Lord and keep giving Him thanks. (How) pure is (your) city and a Lord Most Forgiving!’"
Saba,34,16,"Then they turned away (from obedience). So We let loose against them a devastating flood, and We converted both their gardens into (such) gardens as bearing sour and bitter fruit and tamarisks and a few lote-trees."
Saba,34,17,So We paid them back for their disbelief and ingratitude. And We award (such) punishment to none except the highly ungrateful.
Saba,34,18,"And We set up prominent (and) adjacent settlements between the dwellers, and those towns that We had blessed (on the Yemen-Syria highway), and We had placed between them stopover areas (for rest), whilst travelling up and down, that you may move between them by night and by day in peace and security."
Saba,34,19,"Then they said: ‘O our Lord, place between our break-journey points longer distances.’ And they wronged their souls. So We made them tales (for a lesson of warning). And We disintegrated them into pieces and scattered them. Surely, there are signs in it for every extremely patient and highly thankful person."
Saba,34,20,And no doubt Iblis (Satan) translated his idea about them into reality. So they followed him except a group comprising (the true) believers.
Saba,34,21,And Satan had no power over them but for the reason that We might distinguish those who believe in the Hereafter from those who are in doubt about it. And your Lord is Watchful over everything.
Saba,34,22,Say: ‘Call upon those you consider (gods) apart from Allah. They do not possess even the smallest particle either in the heavens or in the earth. They have no share in either of them (the heavens and the earth). Nor is any one of them a helper to Allah.
Saba,34,23,"And no intercession with His presence will be of any benefit except from someone He has granted permission, until when fright is removed from their hearts and they will say, (inquiring): ‘What has your Lord said?’ They will say (in reply): ‘He has said the truth,’ (i.e., has granted the permission). And He alone is Most High, Most Great."
Saba,34,24,"Say: ‘Who provides you sustenance from the heavens and the earth?’ Say (yourself): ‘Allah (provides). And no doubt, either we or you are guided aright or lost in open error.’"
Saba,34,25,Say: ‘You will not be asked about the sin that (you presume) we have perpetrated. Nor shall we be asked about what you do.’
Saba,34,26,"Say: ‘Our Lord will assemble all of us (on the Day of Rising), then He will judge amongst us with the truth. And He is the Best Judge, All-Knowing.’"
Saba,34,27,"Say: ‘Show me the partners you have associated with Allah. There is no (partner) at all. Truly, He is the One Who is Almighty, Most Wise.’"
Saba,34,28,"And, (O Esteemed Prophet,) We have not sent you but as a Bearer of the glad tidings and as a Warner to the entire mankind, but most people do not know."
Saba,34,29,And they say: ‘When will this promise (of the Last Hour) come true if you are truthful?’
Saba,34,30,Say: ‘The Day of Promise is appointed for you. You will not be able to either put it back for a moment or put it forward.’
Saba,34,31,"And the disbelievers say: ‘We shall not believe in this Qur’an, or in that (Revelation) at all which came before it.’ And if you could see when the wrongdoers shall be made to stand before their Lord, (what a spectacle that will be!) Every one of them will be putting the blame back on others. The humble will say to the conceited: ‘Had you not been there, we would certainly have believed.’"
Saba,34,32,The conceited will say to the humble: ‘Did we hinder you from guidance after it had come to you? The truth is that you were evildoers yourselves.’
Saba,34,33,"The humble will then say to the conceited: ‘Nay, it was (your) deceptive scheming night and day (that hindered us) when you used to order us to disbelieve in Allah and assign equals to Him.’ And they will hide their pangs of guilt (from one another) when they will see the torment. And We will put iron collars round the necks of the disbelievers, and they will be recompensed only for their doings."
Saba,34,34,"And never did We send a Warner to any town, but its wealthy ones would (always) say: ‘We deny (the guidance) you have been sent with.’"
Saba,34,35,And they said: ‘We possess abundant wealth and children and we are not going to be tormented.’
Saba,34,36,"Say: ‘Surely, my Lord releases sustenance in abundance for whom He wills and restrains (for whom He wills) but most people do not know.’"
Saba,34,37,"And it is not your wealth or your children that can bring you nearness and intimacy in Our presence. But whoever believes and does good works, it is they for whom the reward is twofold for their works. And they will live in peace in lofty mansions (of Paradise)."
Saba,34,38,"And those who strive (in opposition) to Our Revelations presuming to frustrate (Us), it is they who will be brought to the torment."
Saba,34,39,"Say: ‘Surely, my Lord releases sustenance in abundance for whom He wills and restrains for whom (He likes). And whatever you spend (in the way of Allah), He will increase it with more in recompense. And He is the Best Sustainer.’"
Saba,34,40,"And the Day when He will gather all together, then He will say to the angels: ‘Is it they who used to worship you?’"
Saba,34,41,"They will submit: ‘Glory be to You! You alone are our Protector, not they! In fact, they used to worship the jinn. It was in them that most of them believed.’"
Saba,34,42,So Today you have no authority over profit or loss of one another. And We shall say to the wrongdoers: ‘Savour the taste of the torment of Hell that you used to belie.’
Saba,34,43,"And when Our illumining Verses are recited to them, they say: ‘This (Messenger [blessings and peace be upon him]) is only a man who wants to hinder you from those (idols) your fathers used to worship.’ And they (also) say: ‘This (Qur’an) is merely a fabricated lie.’ And the disbelievers (also) say about this truth (the Qur’an) whilst it has come to them: ‘It is nothing but obvious magic.’"
Saba,34,44,"And neither did We give them (the residents of Mecca) the revealed Books, which they would recite, nor did We send to them any Warner before you."
Saba,34,45,And the preceding communities also denied (the truth). And they have not yet attained even one tenth of what We granted them (the bygone people). But they too denied My Messengers. So how (awful) was My denial indeed!
Saba,34,46,"Say: ‘I advise you only one thing: stand up for Allah in twos or singly (warned and spiritually awake). Then meditate (i.e., inspect the reality and introspect; the truth will dawn on you) that he (the Holy Messenger [blessings and peace be upon him]), who has honoured you with his companionship, is not touched by any mania. He is but a Warner giving you a (timely) warning before the severe torment (comes, so that you may wake up from neglectfulness and unawareness).’"
Saba,34,47,"Say: ‘Any reward that I might have sought from you (for this favour), I have given that back to you. My reward is with Allah alone. And He keeps watch over everything.’"
Saba,34,48,Say: ‘My Lord reveals the truth (to the Prophets. He) is the All-Knower of all the unseen.’
Saba,34,49,"Say: ‘The truth has come, and falsehood can neither originate (anything), nor can it regenerate.’"
Saba,34,50,"Say: ‘If I were to lose the straight path, the sin (or harm) of losing the straight path would afflict only my soul, and if I am rightly guided, it is so because my Lord sends His Revelation to me. Surely, He is All-Hearing, Ever-Near.’"
Saba,34,51,"And if you visualize (their plight), when they will be most upset, they will not then be able to escape, and will be seized from a nearby place."
Saba,34,52,And they will say: ‘We have believed in it.’ But how can they now attain to (faith) from (such) a far-off place?
Saba,34,53,"In fact, they had disbelieved before this. And they have been throwing arrows of falsehood and doubt without seeing from a distant place."
Saba,34,54,"And a barrier was placed between them and their desires, as was done before with the people of their kind. Surely, they were suffering from a deceiving doubt."
The Angels,35,1,"All praise belongs to Allah alone, Who is the Creator of (all the infinities of) the heavens and the earth, and Who makes the angels messengers having two or three or four wings. He adds to (and expands) the creation as He wills. Surely, Allah is All-Powerful over everything."
The Angels,35,2,"Whatever of (the treasure of) His mercy Allah opens to mankind, there is none who can withhold it. And whatever He withholds, then after this there is none who may release it. And He alone is Almighty, Most Wise."
The Angels,35,3,"O people! Persistently remember the favour that Allah has bestowed on you. Is there any Creator other than Allah, Who may provide you sustenance from the heaven and the earth? There is no God but He. So where are you wandering, disorientated?"
The Angels,35,4,"And if they reject you, many Messengers have been rejected before you. And all matters will be returned to Allah alone."
The Angels,35,5,"O people! Certainly, the promise of Allah is true. So let not the worldly life deceive you at all. Nor let the Arch-Deceiver, Satan, deceive you (in the Name) of Allah."
The Angels,35,6,"Assuredly, Satan is your enemy, so keep treating him as an enemy (being his adversary). He only calls his party to make them join the denizens of Hell."
The Angels,35,7,There is a severe torment for those who disbelieve and there is forgiveness and a mighty reward for those who believe and keep doing pious deeds.
The Angels,35,8,"So what about him whose evil action has been made attractive to him, but he (actually) starts to consider it good? (How can he be like a virtuous believer?) Surely, Allah holds astray whoever He wills and guides to the straight path whoever He wills. (O Life of the universe!) Let not your soul waste away in grief for them. Surely, Allah is Best Aware of whatever they do."
The Angels,35,9,"And Allah alone sends winds that raise and build up clouds. Then We drive it (the cloud) towards some dry and dead land to water it. Then with that, We give life to the earth after its death. Similar will be the process of the rising (of the dead)."
The Angels,35,10,"Whoever desires honour, then to Allah belongs all honour. The pure words ascend to Him alone, and He is the One Who elevates (the grades of) a pious deed. And those who are continually engaged in evil maneuvers, for them is severe punishment and their deceiving schemes will go void."
The Angels,35,11,"And Allah alone created you from clay (i.e., inorganic matter), then from a sperm drop, then He made you pairs. And no female conceives or gives birth but with His knowledge. And no aged man’s life is increased, nor is his age decreased, but (all this) is recorded in a Book (al-Lawh al-Mahfuz). That is certainly easy for Allah."
The Angels,35,12,"And two seas (or rivers) cannot be the same: this (one) is sweet, thirst-quenching and pleasant to drink and that (other) is salty and very bitter. And you eat fresh meat from each and bring forth ornaments (including pearls and corals) that you wear. And you see in them boats (and ships) that cleave through (the water), so that you may seek His bounty (through marine trade routes) and that you may become grateful."
The Angels,35,13,"He causes the night to pass into the day and the day to pass into the night. And He has subjected the sun and the moon (to a system), each rotating for an appointed term. Such is Allah, your Lord. His is all the sovereignty. And the idols that you worship apart from Him do not own (even) the thin membrane of a date stone."
The Angels,35,14,"(O polytheists!) If you call upon them (the idols), they cannot hear your call. But if (supposing) they (the idols) hear, they cannot give you an answer. And on the Day of Resurrection, they will downright deny your setting up of partners with Allah. And none will make you aware like Allah, the Well Aware."
The Angels,35,15,"O mankind! You all are dependent upon Allah, and Allah is the One Who is Independent, Most Praiseworthy."
The Angels,35,16,"If He wills, He will destroy you and bring in a new creation."
The Angels,35,17,And that is not at all difficult for Allah.
The Angels,35,18,"And no bearer of burden will bear another’s burden (of sins). And if someone heavily loaded calls (another) to share his load, nothing of his burden will be carried by him even though he be a close relative. (O Beloved!) You warn but those who fear their Lord unseen and establish Prayer. And whoever acquires purity does so to his own benefit. And to Allah is the return."
The Angels,35,19,And the blind and the seeing cannot be alike;
The Angels,35,20,Nor (can) the darkness and the light (be alike);
The Angels,35,21,Nor the shade and the hot sun;
The Angels,35,22,"Nor can the living and the dead be alike. Surely, Allah makes whom He wills hear, and it is not your responsibility to make those hear who are (like those buried) in the graves* (i.e., you are not responsible to make the disbelievers accept what you say)."
The Angels,35,23,You are only a Warner.
The Angels,35,24,"Surely, We have sent you with the truth and guidance as a Bearer of good news and a Warner (for the Hereafter). And there is not a single Umma (community) but amongst whom there came (some) Warner."
The Angels,35,25,"And if they deny you, then surely the people before you have (also) denied. Their Messengers (also) came to them with clear signs and scriptures and the illumining Book."
The Angels,35,26,Then I seized those disbelievers (with the torment). So how (awful) was My denial indeed!
The Angels,35,27,"Have you not seen that Allah sent down water from the sky? Then We brought forth with that the fruits which have different colours. And, similarly, in the mountains there are white and red streaks with a variety of shades and there are deep black (streaks) as well."
The Angels,35,28,"And likewise, there are various colours amongst men and beasts and animals. So only those of His servants who have knowledge (of these realities with a vision and outlook) fear Him. Surely, Allah is Almighty, Most Forgiving."
The Angels,35,29,"Surely, those who recite the Book of Allah and establish Prayer and spend secretly and openly in Our way out of what We have given them look forward to a trade (in the Hereafter) which will never run into loss,"
The Angels,35,30,"So that Allah pays them their reward in full and blesses them more out of His bounty. Surely, Allah is Most Forgiving, Most Appreciative of thanks."
The Angels,35,31,"And the Book (the Qur’an) that We have revealed to you is the truth and confirms the former Books. Surely, Allah is Well Aware of His servants, All-Seeing."
The Angels,35,32,"Then We made those whom We chose from amongst Our servants (i.e., the Muslim Umma [Community]) the inheritors of the Book (the Qur’an). So of them are those who wrong their own souls, and of them are also those who are moderate, following the middle course, and of them are still those who excel in doing pious deeds by Allah’s command. This (excelling and becoming perfect) is but a great bounty (of Allah)."
The Angels,35,33,"They shall enter the Gardens of Eden (Eden Paradise for eternal stay). Therein they will be adorned with bracelets of gold and pearls, and their dress will be made of silk."
The Angels,35,34,"And they will say: ‘All gratitude and praise belong to Allah, Who has removed from us all grief. Surely, our Lord is Most Forgiving, Most Appreciative of gratitude,"
The Angels,35,35,"Who has, out of His bounty, admitted us to a timeless abode wherein will touch us neither labour nor fatigue.’"
The Angels,35,36,"And those who disbelieved, for them is the Fire of Hell. Neither will (death) be decreed for them that they should die, nor will anything of their torment be lessened. We pay back every disobedient person the same way."
The Angels,35,37,"And they will howl in Hell: ‘O our Lord, take us out (from here). We shall (now) do righteous works different from those (works) we used to do (before).’ (Allah will say:) ‘Did We not grant you long enough life during which whoever wanted to seek advice might reflect? And (moreover) the Warner too had come to you. So savour now the taste (of the torment), and there will be no helper for the wrongdoers."
The Angels,35,38,"Surely, Allah knows the unseen of the heavens and the earth. He is undoubtedly Well Aware of things (hidden) in breasts."
The Angels,35,39,He is the One Who made you successors (of former communities) in the earth. So the one who disbelieves is to face the suffering of disbelief. And the denial of the disbelievers increases nothing for them in the sight of their Lord except His displeasure. And the infidels’ disbelief adds to them nothing but loss.
The Angels,35,40,"Say: ‘Have you seen your partner-gods you worship apart from Allah? Show me what they have created of the earth. Or do they have any share in (the creation of) the heavens? Or have We given them any Book so that they stick to its evidence? (Nothing at all!) In fact, the wrongdoers promise one another nothing but deception."
The Angels,35,41,"Surely, Allah is holding the heavens and the earth (through His control system) lest they should move away (from their respective locations and orbits). And if they start deviating, then none can hold them after Him. Surely, He is Most Forbearing, Most Forgiving."
The Angels,35,42,"And they used to swear solemn oaths by Allah that if a Warner came to them, they would certainly be far more on the straight path than any other community. But when the Warner (the Final Messenger of Allah [blessings and peace be upon him]) came to them, it only increased their aversion to the truth."
The Angels,35,43,(They opted) to consider themselves the greatest in the earth and to maneuver evil schemes. And the evil schemes encompass only the schemer. So they are waiting (for nothing) but the pattern of (torment that seized) the bygone people. And you will not find any amendment in Allah’s Sunna. Nor will you find any divergence (and digression) in Allah’s Sunna.
The Angels,35,44,"Have they not travelled in the land and seen what was the end of the people who have passed before them? They were far more powerful than these people are. And nothing in the heavens or earth can make Allah helpless. Indeed, He is All-Knowing, All-Powerful."
The Angels,35,45,"And if Allah were to seize people (by torment) for the (evil) deeds which they have earned, He would not spare any moving creature on the surface of the earth. But He is giving them respite till an appointed time. Then when their appointed time comes, Allah is Ever-Vigilant of His servants."
Yâ Sîn,36,1,Ya-Sin. (Only Allah and the Messenger [blessings and peace be upon him] know the real meaning.)
Yâ Sîn,36,2,"By the Qur’an, full of wisdom,"
Yâ Sîn,36,3,"You are indeed one of the Messengers,"
Yâ Sîn,36,4,On the straight path.
Yâ Sîn,36,5,"This is revealed by the Almighty, Ever-Merciful,"
Yâ Sîn,36,6,That you may warn the people whose fathers were (also) not warned. So they are careless and neglectful.
Yâ Sîn,36,7,"In fact, Our command has proved true against most of them. So they will not believe."
Yâ Sîn,36,8,"Surely, We have put iron collars round their necks reaching their chins. So they have raised their heads up."
Yâ Sîn,36,9,"And We have set a barrier before them and a barrier behind them, and We have cast a veil over their eyes so they do not see anything."
Yâ Sîn,36,10,"And it is all the same for them whether you warn or do not warn them, they will not believe."
Yâ Sîn,36,11,You can only warn the one who follows the direction and guidance and fears the Most Kind (Lord) unseen. So give him the good news of forgiveness and a reward of great honour.
Yâ Sîn,36,12,"Surely, We alone raise the dead to life. And We are writing down (the deeds) which they have sent forward and their effects (that are left behind). And We have encompassed everything in the illumining Book (al-Lawh al-Mahfuz)."
Yâ Sîn,36,13,And narrate to them the (legendary) example of the people of a city (Antioch—an ancient city in Northern Syria) when there came to them some Messengers.
Yâ Sîn,36,14,"When (at first) We sent to them two Messengers, they rejected them both. Then We reinforced (them) with a third (Messenger). Then the three of them said: ‘Surely, we have been sent to you.’"
Yâ Sîn,36,15,"(The people of the city) said: ‘You are but human beings like us, and the Most Kind (Lord) has not sent down anything. You are only lying.’"
Yâ Sîn,36,16,"(The Messengers) said: ‘Surely, our Lord knows that we have been sent to you."
Yâ Sîn,36,17,And there is nothing binding upon us except to communicate the message clearly.’
Yâ Sîn,36,18,"(The people of the city) said: ‘An evil omen has reached us from you. If you do not desist, we shall certainly stone you, and you will definitely suffer an agonizing punishment at our hands.’"
Yâ Sîn,36,19,"(The Messengers) said: ‘Your evil omen is with you. Is it an evil omen that you are admonished? Nay, but you are a people who exceed limits.’"
Yâ Sîn,36,20,"And a person came running from the farthest end of the city. He said: ‘O my people, follow the Messengers."
Yâ Sîn,36,21,Follow those who do not ask from you any compensation and who are rightly guided.
Yâ Sîn,36,22,And what is the matter with me that I should not worship Him Who has created me and to Him (all of) you will be returned?
Yâ Sîn,36,23,"Should I take such gods apart from Him (Allah) that if the Most Kind (Lord) intends to do me any harm, their intercession would not bring me any benefit, nor would they be able to rescue me?"
Yâ Sîn,36,24,"Then, certainly, I would be in open error."
Yâ Sîn,36,25,"Surely, I have believed in your Lord, so listen to me (attentively).’"
Yâ Sîn,36,26,"(The disbelievers martyred him; then it) was said (to him): ‘(Come,) enter Paradise.’ He said: ‘Alas! Would that my people knew,"
Yâ Sîn,36,27,"That my Lord has forgiven me, and put me amongst the honoured and near ones.’"
Yâ Sîn,36,28,"And, after him, We did not send any army (of angels) from the heaven to his people, nor were We to send down (angels to destroy them)."
Yâ Sîn,36,29,"(Their torment) was nothing but a Mighty Blast, and there were they extinguished (dead like charred coal)."
Yâ Sîn,36,30,Ah! Woe to (these) servants! Never did a Messenger come to them but they used to mock him.
Yâ Sîn,36,31,"Have they not seen how many communities We destroyed before them, and that now they will not return to them,"
Yâ Sîn,36,32,But that all of them will be brought before Our presence?
Yâ Sîn,36,33,"And a sign for them is the dead earth to which We gave life, and We brought forth from it (grain); then they eat of it."
Yâ Sîn,36,34,"And We produced in it gardens of date-palms and grapes, and also caused some springs as well to gush forth in it,"
Yâ Sîn,36,35,So that they may eat of its fruits. And it is not their hands that made it. Do they not thank (even) then?
Yâ Sîn,36,36,"Glory be to Him Who created everything in pairs of those the earth grows and of themselves as well and, (moreover,) of the things they do not know."
Yâ Sîn,36,37,And (also) a sign for them is the night: (how) We draw the day out from it! So then they are left in darkness!
Yâ Sîn,36,38,"And the sun is constantly rotating (non-stop) for its appointed destination. It is a measure fixed by the Almighty, All-Knowing (Lord)."
Yâ Sîn,36,39,And We have also appointed stages (of motion and rotation) of the moon till (its appearance to the dwellers of the earth wanes to) the semblance of an old dry branch of a palm-tree.
Yâ Sîn,36,40,"Neither can the sun (deviate from its orbit and) overtake the moon, nor can the night precede the day, and all (the stars and planets) are moving in their respective orbits."
Yâ Sîn,36,41,And a sign for them is (also) that We boarded their fathers (the Children of Adam) into the laden Ark of (Nuh [Noah] and saved them).
Yâ Sîn,36,42,And like this (Ark) We made for them (many other means of transport) which they ride.
Yâ Sîn,36,43,"And if We intend, We drown them. Then there will not be any to respond to their cry, nor will they be saved anyway,"
Yâ Sîn,36,44,Except for Our mercy and (this) provision is for an appointed term.
Yâ Sîn,36,45,And (recall) when it is said to them: ‘Fear that (torment) which is before you and which is behind you so that you may be shown mercy.’
Yâ Sîn,36,46,And not a sign of the signs of their Lord comes to them but they turn away from it.
Yâ Sîn,36,47,"And when it is said to them: ‘Spend (in the way of Allah) of what Allah has given you,’ the disbelievers say to the believers: ‘Shall we feed that (poor) man whom, if Allah so willed, He would feed (Himself)?’ You are but (caught) in clear error."
Yâ Sîn,36,48,And they say: ‘When will this promise (of the Last Hour) be fulfilled if you are truthful?’
Yâ Sîn,36,49,"They are simply waiting for a Mighty Blast which will seize them (all of a sudden), and they will be disputing amongst themselves."
Yâ Sîn,36,50,Then they will not be able to make a will or to return to their families.
Yâ Sîn,36,51,And (when) the Trumpet will be blown (again) they will come out of the graves at once and run towards their Lord.
Yâ Sîn,36,52,"(Seeing the horrors of the Hour of Resurrection,) they will say: ‘Ah, woe to us! Who has raised us from our sleeping places? This (coming back to life) is the same that the Most Kind (Lord) promised and the Messengers spoke the truth.’"
Yâ Sîn,36,53,This will only be a Mighty Blast. Then all of them will be brought to Our presence straight away.
Yâ Sîn,36,54,So Today no soul will be wronged in the least. Nor will you be rewarded except for the deeds you used to do.
Yâ Sîn,36,55,"Surely, the residents of Paradise will be rejoicing Today (in their) favourite pastime pursuits (like spiritual visits, entertainments, sessions of hymns and eulogies)."
Yâ Sîn,36,56,"They and their wives will be reclining on raised couches under the deep, calming shades."
Yâ Sîn,36,57,There they will be provided with fruits (of every kind) and will find (available) everything they will solicit.
Yâ Sîn,36,58,‘Peace (be upon you)!’ (This) greeting will be conveyed (to them) from the Ever-Merciful Lord.
Yâ Sîn,36,59,"‘And, O evildoers, get aside (from the righteous) this Day."
Yâ Sîn,36,60,O Children of Adam! Did I not take this covenant from you not to worship Satan; no doubt he is your open enemy;
Yâ Sîn,36,61,And that you keep worshipping Me alone? That is the straight path.
Yâ Sîn,36,62,"And surely, he led great many of you astray, so had you not any wisdom?"
Yâ Sîn,36,63,This is the same Hell that was being promised to you.
Yâ Sîn,36,64,"Enter this Hell Today, for you kept disbelieving.’"
Yâ Sîn,36,65,"Today We shall seal their mouths, and their hands will speak to Us, and their feet will bear witness to the deeds which they used to earn."
Yâ Sîn,36,66,"And if We had so willed, We would have obliterated the very marks of their eyes. Then if they would have run on the path, how could they have seen?"
Yâ Sîn,36,67,"And if We had so intended, We would have defaced them in their places. Then they would have power neither to go forward nor to turn back."
Yâ Sîn,36,68,"And someone whom We give long life, We cause him to degenerate (towards childhood and debility) in strength and disposition. So, do they not have sense?"
Yâ Sîn,36,69,"And We have not taught him (the Holy Messenger [blessings and peace be upon him]) composing poetry, nor does it befit his dignity. This (Book) is but direction and guidance and the illumining Qur’an,"
Yâ Sîn,36,70,"So that it may warn the one who is alive, and the word of judgment may be proved against the disbelievers."
Yâ Sîn,36,71,"Have they not seen that We created for them cattle out of the (creation) We made with Our Mighty Hand, so they are their owners?"
Yâ Sîn,36,72,And We subjected those (cattle) to them. So some of them are their riding animals and they eat some of them.
Yâ Sîn,36,73,And there are other benefits and drinks in them as well for them. Then why do they not give thanks?
Yâ Sîn,36,74,And they have made idols their gods other than Allah with the hope that they will be helped.
Yâ Sîn,36,75,These idols are incapable of helping them. And these (disbelievers and polytheists) will be an army of these (idols) that will be brought (into Hell together).
Yâ Sîn,36,76,"So let not what they utter hurt you. Surely, We know whatever they hide and whatever they make public."
Yâ Sîn,36,77,"Has man not seen that We have created him from a sperm drop? Even then, he has become an open adversary."
Yâ Sîn,36,78,And he (himself) puts forth examples for Us and has forgotten (the truth of) his creation. He says: ‘Who will give life to bones when they will have been decomposed?’
Yâ Sîn,36,79,Say: ‘He Who created them the first time will give them life. And He knows best every creation;
Yâ Sîn,36,80,He Who produces fire for you out of the green tree so now you kindle fire with the same!
Yâ Sîn,36,81,"And does He Who created the heavens and the earth not have the power to create the like of them (again)?’ Yes indeed! And He is the Supreme Creator, the All-Knowing."
Yâ Sîn,36,82,"His command (of creation) is only that when He intends (to create) something, He says to it: ‘Be,’ so it instantly becomes (existent or visible and continues becoming)."
Yâ Sîn,36,83,"So, Glory be to Him in Whose Hand (i.e., power and control) is the sovereignty over everything and to Him you will be returned."
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,1,"By the parties ranged in close ranks,"
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,2,"And by those who drive away the clouds or by those parties who severely reprimand evils,"
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,3,"Then by those parties that remember Allah (or) recite (the Holy Qur’an),"
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,4,"Surely, your God is One,"
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,5,"The Lord of the heavens and the earth and whatever (creation) is between them, and the Lord of every point of sunrise."
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,6,"Surely, We have adorned the world’s heaven (the first heavenly sphere) with the adornment of stars and planets,"
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,7,And made (them) secure from every rebellious satan.
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,8,"They (satans) cannot listen to the celestial world. And (burning brands) are thrown on them from every side,"
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,9,To repulse them. And for them there is eternal torment.
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,10,"But that (satan) who snatches away (something from angels), a burning brand follows it in chase."
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,11,"Ask them: ‘Are they harder (and more difficult) to create, or those things which We have created (in the heavenly universe)? Surely, We have created them from a sticky clay.’"
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,12,But you express your wonder whilst they make fun.
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,13,"And when they are given advice, they do not accept it."
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,14,"And when they see some sign, they mock it,"
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,15,And say: ‘This is but obvious magic.
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,16,"What! When we are dead and turned to dust and bones, shall we certainly be raised (alive again)?"
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,17,And shall our forefathers too (be raised)?’
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,18,"Say: ‘Yes, (of course,) and you will be disgraced and humiliated (as well).’"
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,19,"So, it will be merely a single dreadful shout (of a stern call). Then all will suddenly (rise and) begin to stare."
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,20,And they will say: ‘Woe to us! This is the Day of Requital.’
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,21,"(It will be said: ‘Yes,) this is the same Day of Judgment which you used to reject."
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,22,"Assemble all those who committed injustice as well as their companions and followers and those (false gods) that they used to worship,"
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,23,Besides Allah. Then take them to the path of Hell.
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,24,And halt them (near the passage); they shall be interrogated.’
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,25,(It will be said to them:) ‘What has happened to you that you do not help one another?’
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,26,"(What help can they provide?) For, in truth, they will be standing bending their necks Today."
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,27,"And turning to one another, they will mutually question."
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,28,"They will say: ‘Surely, it is you who used to come to us from the right side (i.e., asserting on oath of being right).’"
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,29,(Their misleading leaders) will say: ‘The truth is that it was you yourselves who did not believe.
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,30,Nor did we have any authority (and control) over you. But you yourselves were a rebellious people.
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,31,So the command of our Lord has been proved against us. (Now) we are about to taste (the torment).
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,32,"So we led you astray. Surely, we ourselves had gone astray.’"
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,33,"So on that Day, they (all) will share the torment."
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,34,"No doubt, this is how We deal with the sinners."
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,35,"Surely, they were such people that when it was said to them: ‘There is none worthy of worship except Allah,’ they used to show arrogance,"
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,36,And used to say: ‘Are we going to forsake our gods for the sake of an insane poet?’
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,37,(He is neither an insane person nor a poet.) He has rather brought the truth (Din [Religion]) and confirmed the Messengers (of Allah).
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,38,"Verily, you are about to taste the painful torment."
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,39,And you will not be given (any) reward but for what you used to do.
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,40,"(Yes,) but those (exalted and chosen) servants of Allah who have divested themselves of (their ill-commanding selves and its pursuits),"
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,41,"It is they for whom a special provision is appointed (morning and evening),"
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,42,"Fruits (of every kind). And they will be honoured and venerated,"
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,43,"(Abiding) in Gardens of bliss and bounty,"
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,44,(Making spiritual disclosures) face to face on raised couches.
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,45,Round them will be passed cups of (sacred) overflowing drink.
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,46,"It will be sparkling white and superbly delicious, a treat for those who drink."
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,47,It will not cause any harm or giddiness; nor will they lose balance (after drinking it).
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,48,"And beside them will be (sitting chaste women) with lowered gazes and wide beautiful eyes,"
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,49,"(Fair, charming complexion, they will look) as if they were eggs protected from dust."
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,50,Then those (residents of Paradise) will turn to one another and mutually inquire (about their well-being).
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,51,One (of the participants in conversation) will say (to the other): ‘There was an acquaintance of mine (who disbelieved in the Hereafter).
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,52,He used to say (to me): Are you (also) of those who confirm and firmly believe (in these things)?
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,53,"(That) when we are dead and have become dust and bones, so shall we be requited (in that condition)?’"
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,54,Then he (the dweller of Paradise) will say: ‘Will you peer down to see (him in which plight he is)?’
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,55,"Then on peering down, he will find him (right) in the middle of Hell."
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,56,"(He) will say (to him): ‘By my Lord, you had nearly ruined me."
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,57,"And had it not been the favour of my Lord, I (too) would have joined those who are brought (for torment with you).’"
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,58,So (the dwellers of Paradise will gladly ask:) ‘Shall we not die now?
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,59,Except for the first death (which we have passed through and have reached here) and shall we not be ever tormented?’
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,60,This is surely the supreme success.
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,61,For such (a success) the doers should do work.
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,62,Is the hospitality (of Paradise) better or the tree of Zaqqum?
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,63,"Undoubtedly, We have made this (tree) a torment for the wrongdoers."
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,64,"Truly, this is a tree that springs out from the bottom of Hell."
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,65,The spikes of its fruit are as if heads of (ugly) satans.
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,66,So the inmates of Hell have to eat of it alone and have to fill their bellies with the same.
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,67,"Then for sure there will be scalding water mixed (with pus) for them after (eating, which will cut through their guts)."
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,68,Then (after eating) surely they will return to Hell (again).
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,69,"Surely, they found their ancestors misguided."
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,70,So they are made to rush on in their footsteps.
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,71,"And in fact, most of the former people (also) lost the straight path."
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,72,"And surely, We sent the Warners amongst them as well."
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,73,"So see how was the end of those who were warned,"
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,74,Except for the chosen and exalted servants of Allah.
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,75,"And, verily, Nuh (Noah) cried to Us. So how excellent We are to respond to the prayers!"
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,76,And We delivered him and his family from the ordeal.
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,77,And We made his offspring the only survivors.
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,78,"And We made his virtuous remembrance endure amongst the successors (i.e., the Messengers and their people)."
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,79,Peace be on Nuh (Noah) in all the worlds!
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,80,"Surely, We requite the pious the same way."
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,81,He was indeed of Our servants blessed with (perfect) faith.
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,82,Then We drowned the others.
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,83,"And verily, of his party was Ibrahim ([Abraham] as well, on him be peace)."
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,84,"When he appeared before his Lord with a purified and submissive heart,"
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,85,"He said to his father (who was in fact his uncle, and he used to call him father, for he had brought him up) and his people: ‘What is it that you worship?"
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,86,"Do you go for false gods besides Allah, inventing a false allegation?"
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,87,Well! What do you think of the Lord of all the worlds?’
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,88,"Then Ibrahim (Abraham) cast a look at the stars (to put them in doubt),"
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,89,And said: ‘I am not well (so cannot accompany you to the festival).’
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,90,At that they turned their backs on him and left (for the festival).
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,91,Then Ibrahim (Abraham) went up to their gods (idols) quietly and said to them: ‘Do you not eat?
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,92,What is the matter with you that you do not speak?’
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,93,Then Ibrahim (Abraham) began striking (and breaking) them with full force.
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,94,Then the people came to him running (on returning from the festival).
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,95,"Ibrahim (Abraham) said (to them): ‘Do you worship these (inanimate stones) which you yourselves carve out,"
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,96,Whilst Allah has created you and (all) your doings?’
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,97,"They said: ‘Raise for him a building (to burn him), then cast him into the blazing fire (in it).’"
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,98,"So they attempted to play a trick against Ibrahim (Abraham), but We humiliated them (when the fire eventually turned into a flower garden)."
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,99,"Then Ibrahim (Abraham) said: ‘(Migrating,) I am going to my Lord. He will certainly guide me.’ (He migrated to Syria)."
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,100,"(Reaching the sacred land, he prayed:) ‘O my Lord, bless me with (a son,) one of the pious.’"
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,101,So We gave him the good news of a very forbearing son (Isma‘il [Ishmael]).
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,102,"Then when (Isma‘il [Ishmael]) reached (the age of) the ability to run about with him, Ibrahim (Abraham) said: ‘O my son, I have seen in a dream that I am sacrificing you. So think, what is your opinion?’ Isma‘il (Ishmael) said: ‘O my father, do that (immediately) which you are being commanded. If Allah wills, you will find me amongst the patient (and steadfast).’"
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,103,"So when both submitted (to the will of Allah i.e., both surrendered to Allah’s command), and Ibrahim (Abraham) laid him down on his forehead—(the subsequent sight has not been described;)"
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,104,And We called out to him: ‘O Ibrahim (Abraham)!
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,105,"(How wonderfully) have you made your dream really true!’ Surely, We pay back the spiritually excellent the same way. (So you are blessed with the prominence of Our closest friend.)"
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,106,It was by far a great open trial.
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,107,And We ransomed him with a great sacrifice.
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,108,"And We preserved his virtuous remembrance (i.e., praise) amongst the succeeding generations."
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,109,Peace be upon Ibrahim (Abraham)!
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,110,That is how We pay back those who are committed to spiritual excellence.
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,111,"Surely, he was of Our servants with (perfect faith)."
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,112,"And (after Isma‘il [Ishmael]) We gave him the good news of Ishaq (Isaac). He was (also) a Prophet, one of the most pious."
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,113,And We bestowed blessings on him and on Ishaq (Isaac). And amongst their descendants are both the virtuous as well as those who expressly wrong themselves.
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,114,"And surely, We blessed Musa (Moses) and Harun (Aaron) as well with Our favours."
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,115,And We delivered them and their people from the ordeal.
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,116,"And We helped them, so it was they who overmastered."
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,117,And We gave both of them the clear and enlightening Book (the Torah).
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,118,And We guided them both to the straight path.
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,119,And We preserved their virtuous remembrance (also) amongst the succeeding generations.
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,120,Peace be upon Musa (Moses) and Harun (Aaron)!
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,121,That is how We pay back those who are committed to spiritual excellence.
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,122,"Surely, both of them were of Our servants blessed with (perfect faith)."
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,123,"And indeed, Ilyas (Elias too) was one of the Messengers."
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,124,When he said to his people: ‘Do you not fear (Allah)?
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,125,"Do you worship (the idol named) Ba‘l and turn away from the Best of creators,"
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,126,"Allah, Who is your Lord and the Lord of your foregoing ancestors (as well)?’"
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,127,"But they (the people of Ba‘lbek) gave lie to Ilyas (Elias), so they will (also) be brought (to the torment of Hell),"
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,128,Except the chosen servants of Allah.
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,129,And We preserved his virtuous remembrance (also) amongst the succeeding generations.
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,130,Peace be upon Ilyas (Elias)!
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,131,That is how We pay back those who are committed to spiritual excellence.
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,132,"Surely, he was of Our servants blessed with (perfect faith)."
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,133,"And verily, Lut (Lot too) was one of the Messengers."
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,134,"When We delivered him and the whole of his family,"
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,135,Except that old woman who was of those who stayed behind;
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,136,Then We destroyed the others.
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,137,"And surely, you pass by (the remains of their ruined towns whilst going from Mecca to Syria) in the morning,"
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,138,And at night as well. Do you not even then understand?
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,139,"And Yunus (Jonah too) was indeed one of the Messengers,"
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,140,When he ran towards the full boat.
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,141,"Then (when it was caught into a whirlpool) they cast lots, and (in the draws) he came to be the loser (i.e., his name was drawn and those in the boat cast him overboard into the river)."
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,142,Then the fish swallowed him and he was a (self-condemning) repentant.
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,143,"Then if he had not been of those who glorify (Allah),"
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,144,He would have stayed in the belly (of the fish) till the Day when people will be resurrected (from the graves).
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,145,"Then We cast him onto a wide plain (i.e., the beach) whilst he was sick."
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,146,And We caused a creeping (gourd) plant to grow over him.
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,147,"And We sent him towards (the people of Nineveh in the land of Mosul,) a population of a hundred thousand or more."
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,148,"(Seeing the signs of torment,) they believed. So We granted them prosperity for a time."
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,149,So ask these (disbelievers of Mecca): ‘Are there daughters for your Lord and sons for them?
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,150,Did We create the angels as females and were they present (on the occasion)?’
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,151,"Listen! They assuredly say (this) out of their fabrications,"
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,152,That Allah has begotten children and surely they are liars.
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,153,Has He chosen daughters instead of sons? (The creed of the disbelievers of Mecca is being refuted in the language of their logic and mentality.)
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,154,What is the matter with you? How do you judge?
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,155,Do you not ponder?
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,156,Do you have any clear proof (to establish your philosophy and ideology)?
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,157,Produce your book if you are truthful.
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,158,"And they have fabricated a blood relationship between Allah and the jinn (as well), whereas the jinn know that they (too) will be made to appear (before the presence of Allah)."
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,159,"Holy is Allah, Transcendent of what they utter."
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,160,But the chosen and exalted servants of Allah (do not say such things; they are not amongst them).
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,161,"So you and (the idols) which you worship,"
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,162,"You all cannot misguide (anyone against Allah),"
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,163,Except the one who is bound to fall into Hell.
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,164,And (the angels say:) ‘Every one of us has an appointed station;
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,165,"And surely, we ourselves are those who remain standing in rows;"
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,166,"And surely, we ourselves remain engaged in glorifying (Allah).’"
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,167,"And no doubt, these people used to say:"
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,168,"‘If we (too) had some (Book) of direction and guidance from the bygone people,"
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,169,"Then, certainly, we (too) would have been Allah’s exalted servants.’"
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,170,But (now) they have rejected this (Qur’an). So they will soon come to know (their end).
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,171,"And verily, Our command has been put into effect in respect of the servants whom We sent (i.e., the Messengers),"
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,172,"That it is they who have been granted help,"
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,173,And that essentially it is only Our army that shall dominate.
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,174,So turn your attention away from them for a time.
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,175,And keep watching them (constantly). So they will soon come to know (their end).
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,176,And do they want Our punishment to be hastened?
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,177,"But when that (torment) descends before them, how evil will be the morning of those who were warned!"
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,178,So turn your attention away from them for a while.
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,179,And keep watching them (constantly). So they will soon come to know (their end).
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,180,"Holy is your Lord, the Lord of Honour, Transcendent above these (things) which they utter."
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,181,And peace be upon (all) the Messengers!
Those Who Set The Ranks,37,182,"And all praise be to Allah alone, the Lord of all the worlds."
Sâd,38,1,"Sad. (Only Allah and the Messenger [blessings and peace be upon him] know the real meaning.) By the Holy Qur’an, full of direction and guidance."
Sâd,38,2,"But the disbelievers are in (the trouble of undue and unjust) conceit and arrogance, (suffering from) opposition and enmity (against Our Esteemed Prophet)."
Sâd,38,3,How many a community We have destroyed before them! And they started crying (on seeing the torment) when there was no time left for deliverance (and release).
Sâd,38,4,"And they wondered that a Warner had come to them from amongst themselves and the disbelievers said: ‘He is a magician, a great liar."
Sâd,38,5,Has he turned all the gods into one God? That is indeed a very strange thing!’
Sâd,38,6,"And their chiefs (stood up terminating their meeting with the Holy Prophet [blessings and peace be upon him] at Abu Talib’s house) and walked out saying (to the rest of the people): ‘You also walk out, and be firm-footed in (worshipping) your gods. There is for sure some motive (and purpose) behind it."
Sâd,38,7,We have not heard of this (belief in the Oneness of God) even amongst the last community (of Christianity or the religion of the Quraysh). This is but a fabricated lie.
Sâd,38,8,"Has this admonition (the Qur’an) been sent down to him alone out of all of us?’ To be more precise, they are (caught) in doubt about My admonition. But in truth they have not yet tasted My torment."
Sâd,38,9,"Do they have the treasures of the mercy of your Lord, Who is the Almighty, the Most Benevolent?"
Sâd,38,10,"Or do they possess the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them? (If so,) then they should tie up ropes and climb up (to heaven)."
Sâd,38,11,They are just a worthless army of the armies (of the disbelievers) that is about to be badly defeated at this very place.
Sâd,38,12,"Before them the people of Nuh (Noah) and ‘Ad and (also) Pharaoh, the powerful king (who tortured with stakes), belied and disbelieved;"
Sâd,38,13,"And Thamud and the people of Lut (Lot) and the dwellers of (the Wood) al-Ayka (i.e., the people of Shu‘ayb) too (denied). These were the large armies."
Sâd,38,14,Each (one of these) people rejected the Messengers and My torment became inevitable (for them).
Sâd,38,15,And all of them are waiting for a single mighty blast (shout) in which there will be no deferment.
Sâd,38,16,"And they say: ‘O our Lord, hasten to us our share even before the Day of Reckoning.’"
Sâd,38,17,"(O My Esteemed Beloved!) Continue observing patience with what they say and remember Our servant Dawud (David), who had great power. Certainly, he was ever-turning (to Us in repentance)."
Sâd,38,18,"Indeed, We put mountains under his command which (joining him) used to glorify Me evening and morning,"
Sâd,38,19,And the birds as well that used to flock (in his presence); each would turn towards him (seeking to obey his commands).
Sâd,38,20,"And We strengthened and stabilized his state and rule, and blessed him with wisdom, insight and a decisive (and distinctive) oratory."
Sâd,38,21,And has the news of the contenders reached you when they jumped over the wall and entered the chamber of worship (of Dawud [David])?
Sâd,38,22,"When they came inside to Dawud (David), he felt nervous. They said: ‘Do not feel upset. We are two parties in a dispute. One of us has wronged the other. So judge between us with truth and justice, and do not exceed limits, and lead us towards the right path."
Sâd,38,23,"Surely, he is my brother; he has ninety-nine ewes and I have only one ewe. Yet he says: ‘Give it (also) to me,’ and he suppresses me in conversation (as well)."
Sâd,38,24,"Dawud (David) said: ‘He has done you a wrong in demanding your ewe to add to his own ewes, and it is true that most of the partners wrong one another except those who believe and do pious deeds, and such people are very few.’ And it occurred to Dawud (David) that We had put him to trial (through that dispute). So he prayed for forgiveness from his Lord and fell down prostrate and turned (to Allah) in repentance."
Sâd,38,25,"So We granted him forgiveness, and surely he enjoys special nearness in Our presence and an exalted position (in the Hereafter)."
Sâd,38,26,"O Dawud (David)! Verily, We have made you (Our) vicegerent in the earth. So judge between the people (or rule) with truth and justice. And do not follow your desire, for this (pursuance of desire) shall turn you away from the path of Allah. Surely, those who turn away from the path of Allah, for them is severe punishment because they forget the Day of Reckoning."
Sâd,38,27,And We have not created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them without any purpose and good reason. It is the view and concept of the disbelievers (that this is a purposeless creation that came about by chance). So for the disbelievers there is torment of the Fire of Hell.
Sâd,38,28,Shall We make those who believe and do constructive works like those who corrupt the earth with mischief and destructive works? Or shall We make the pious like the corrupt and wicked?
Sâd,38,29,This is a Blessed Book that We have revealed to you so that the wise may ponder over its Verses and seek direction and guidance.
Sâd,38,30,And We blessed Dawud (David) with (a son) Sulayman (Solomon). How excellent a servant was he! He is indeed oft-returning to Allah in repentance.
Sâd,38,31,"When swift horses of a fine breed were presented to him in the evening,"
Sâd,38,32,"He said (remorsefully): ‘I have cherished love for wealth (i.e., horses) more than the love for the remembrance of my Lord until (the sun) disappeared behind the veil (of night).’"
Sâd,38,33,"He said: ‘Bring them (horses) back to me.’ So he cut away their legs and necks (with a sword, and thus he slaughtered his love for nearness to Allah)."
Sâd,38,34,"And indeed, We (also) put Sulayman (Solomon) to trial, and placed an (unusually created) body on his throne. Then he regained (the rule)."
Sâd,38,35,"He submitted: ‘O my Lord, forgive me, and bestow on me such a reign that no one may have after me. Surely, You are Most Benevolent.’"
Sâd,38,36,Then We caused the wind to obey him. It used to blow gently under his command wherever he would desire (it) to go.
Sâd,38,37,"And all the jinn (and devils were also subdued to him) and every architect and diver (too),"
Sâd,38,38,And (also) other jinn bound in chains.
Sâd,38,39,"(Allah said:) ‘This is Our bestowal. (Whether you) confer (it) on others or hold back (to you), no account will be asked for (in both the cases).’"
Sâd,38,40,"And surely, he enjoys exclusive nearness in Our presence and an exalted position in the Hereafter."
Sâd,38,41,And mention Our servant Ayyub (Job) when he cried to his Lord: ‘Satan has afflicted me with great torture and suffering.’
Sâd,38,42,(Allah said:) ‘Strike the ground with your foot. Here is a spring (of cool water) to bathe and drink.’
Sâd,38,43,"And We gave him his family, and as many more (members of family) along with them, as a special mercy from Us and as advice for the wise."
Sâd,38,44,"(O Ayyub [Job]!) Take a broom of (one hundred) twigs in your hand, and strike (your wife once) with that (to fulfil your oath), and do not break your oath. Surely, We found him steadfast. How excellent a servant was (Ayyub [Job])! Surely, he was oft-returning (to Us) in repentance."
Sâd,38,45,"And mention Our servants Ibrahim (Abraham) and Ishaq (Isaac) and Ya‘qub (Jacob), who wielded great power and possessed vision."
Sâd,38,46,"Surely, We chose them for an exclusive (characteristic of) the remembrance of the home in the Hereafter."
Sâd,38,47,"And verily, in Our Sight they were of the chosen, exalted (and) most liked servants."
Sâd,38,48,And (also) mention Isma‘il (Ishmael) and al-Yasa‘ (Isaiah) and Dhu al-Kifl (Ezekiel). And all of them were of the chosen ones.
Sâd,38,49,"This is the direction and guidance (which is cited in the first Verse of this Sura). And surely, for the Godfearing there is a blessed abode."
Sâd,38,50,(They are) the Gardens of Eden to live in forever. Their doors will be opened for them.
Sâd,38,51,"There, reclining on cushions, they will be sitting (on couches), calling (at intervals) for plenteous fine fruits and (delicious) drinks."
Sâd,38,52,"And beside them will be pure women (houris) with gazes lowered (i.e., chaste) and of equal age."
Sâd,38,53,These are the blessings which you are promised for the Day of Reckoning.
Sâd,38,54,"Surely, this is Our provision which is never to exhaust."
Sâd,38,55,"This (is for the believers), and surely for the defiant there is an extremely evil abode."
Sâd,38,56,"(That is) Hell which they will enter, and that is extremely evil bedding."
Sâd,38,57,This (is punishment) so they should taste it: boiling water and pus.
Sâd,38,58,And there is also a variety of (torments of) similar nature.
Sâd,38,59,"(The Guards of Hell or the inmates of Hell already there will say:) ‘This is an(other) army which is rushing into Hell along with you. There is no welcome for them. Surely, they (too) are about to enter Hell.’"
Sâd,38,60,"They (the arrivals) will say: ‘In fact, it is you; may there be no reception for you! It is but you who brought us this (disbelief and torment). So (this) is an evil resting place.’"
Sâd,38,61,"They will say: ‘O our Lord, the one who brought for us this (disbelief or torment), increase his torment in Hell twofold.’"
Sâd,38,62,And they will say: ‘What is the matter with us that we do not see (those) persons (here) we used to count amongst the evil people?’
Sâd,38,63,"Did we use to scoff at them (unjustly) or did our eyes miss (to recognize) them? (These were the sold-to-God divines like ‘Ammar, Khabab, Suhayb, Bilal and Salman, [may Allah be well pleased with all of them.])"
Sâd,38,64,"Surely, this mutual dispute of the inmates of Hell is true."
Sâd,38,65,"Say: ‘I am only a Warner and there is no God except Allah, the One, the All-Dominant,"
Sâd,38,66,"The Lord of the heavens and the earth and (all) what is between the two, the Almighty, Most Forgiving.’"
Sâd,38,67,Say: ‘That (Day of Rising) is the tremendous piece of news.
Sâd,38,68,You have turned your faces away from it.
Sâd,38,69,I did not know of the Supreme Assembly (of angels on my own) when they were holding discussions (about the creation of Adam).
Sâd,38,70,The only Revelation that is sent to me (from Allah) is that I am but a clear and straight Warner.’
Sâd,38,71,(Recall) when your Lord said to the angels: ‘I am about to create a human organism from (moist) clay.
Sâd,38,72,"Then when I have perfected its (visible body) and blown into its (invisible) self My Own (illumining) spirit, fall down prostrate before him (in his honour).’"
Sâd,38,73,"So all the angels fell down together prostrating themselves before him,"
Sâd,38,74,Except Iblis. He showed arrogance (against the dignity of the Prophet) and became one of the disbelievers.
Sâd,38,75,"(Allah) said: ‘O Iblis, what has prevented you from falling down prostrate before this (exalted person) whom I have created with My Own (Benevolent) Hand? Did you show arrogance (to him), or were you (presuming yourself) high ranking?’"
Sâd,38,76,"(Comparing himself with the Prophet,) he said: ‘I am better than he. You have created me from fire and You have created him from clay.’"
Sâd,38,77,"Allah said: ‘So get out from here (for the sin of insolence against the Prophet). Surely, you are rejected."
Sâd,38,78,"And surely, My curse is on you till the Day of Resurrection.’"
Sâd,38,79,"He said: ‘O Lord, then give me respite (to remain alive) till the Day when they are raised alive from the graves.’"
Sâd,38,80,"Allah said: ‘(Be off;) you are surely of those who are granted respite,"
Sâd,38,81,Till the Day of the time which is appointed (and known).’
Sâd,38,82,"He said: ‘By Your Honour, I shall certainly turn all of them away from the straight path with persistence,"
Sâd,38,83,Except those of Your servants who are chosen and exalted ones.’
Sâd,38,84,"Allah said: ‘So the truth is (this), and the truth I say,"
Sâd,38,85,That I will fill Hell with you and with all those who will follow your (denigrating mindset).’
Sâd,38,86,"Say: ‘I do not ask you for any reward for this (preaching of the truth), nor am I of those who pretend."
Sâd,38,87,This (Qur’an) is only direction and guidance for the whole world.
Sâd,38,88,And you will yourselves come to know its truth after a while.’
The Troops,39,1,"The revelation of this Book is from Allah, the Lord of Honour, All-Wise."
The Troops,39,2,"Surely, We have revealed (this) Book to you with the truth. So worship Allah for His sake alone in sincere obedience."
The Troops,39,3,"(Say to the people:) ‘Listen! Sincere obedience and worship is only Allah’s due.’ And those (disbelievers) who have taken (idols as) helpers other than Allah (say in false justification of their idol-worship:) ‘We worship them only that they may bring us near to Allah.’ Surely, Allah will judge between them concerning the matter in which they differ. Certainly, Allah does not give guidance to the one who is a liar and highly ungrateful."
The Troops,39,4,"Had Allah willed to beget children (for Himself), He would have chosen whom He liked out of His Creation. Glory be to Him, He is Allah, the One, the All-Dominant."
The Troops,39,5,"He created the heavens and the earth with a decreed celestial order and planning. He causes the night to overlap the day and the day to overlap the night. And He is the One Who has subjected the sun and the moon (to a system). Each (star and planet) rotates in its orbit till an appointed time. Beware! He is the One Who is All-Dominant (over the entire system), the Most Forgiving."
The Troops,39,6,"He has created all of you from a single life cell, and then made from it a similar pair. And then He brought about for you eight living animals in pairs. He shapes you in the wombs of your mothers from one creative phase into the next in sequence and (completes this process) in three (germinal) layers. This is Allah, your Lord, to Whom belongs all Power and Authority. There is no God except He. Where then are you deviated (and disoriented after knowing these concealed realities of creation)?"
The Troops,39,7,"If you disbelieve, then surely Allah is Self-Sufficient and He does not like disbelief (and ingratitude) for His servants, and if you give thanks, (so) He likes that for you. And no bearer of burden will bear the burden of any other. Then you have to return to your Lord. Then He will inform you of the deeds which you used to do. Surely, He knows best the secrets of the hearts."
The Troops,39,8,"And when some suffering afflicts man, he turns to his Lord and cries out. Then when (Allah) grants him some blessing from Himself, he forgets that (suffering) which he used to beseech relief from. And (then) he sets up (idols) as partners with Allah to make (others also) lose His way. Say: ‘(O disbeliever,) profit a little (worldly gain) from your disbelief; you are certainly of the inmates of Hell."
The Troops,39,9,"Well! (Is this polytheist better or) that (believer) who worships during the hours of the night standing and in prostration, lives in fear of the Hereafter and expects mercy from his Lord?’ Say: ‘Can those who have knowledge and those who do not be alike?’ So only the wise do receive the admonition."
The Troops,39,10,"(O Beloved,) say (on My behalf), ‘O My servants, you who have believed, adopt Godwariness; it is for the men of spiritual excellence in this world that there is excellent reward. And Allah’s earth is vast. So the steadfast will certainly be given their reward without measure.’"
The Troops,39,11,Say: ‘I have been commanded to worship Allah in sincerest obedience and devotion to Him alone.’
The Troops,39,12,And I was (also) commanded to become the first Muslim of all (His creation).
The Troops,39,13,"Say: ‘If I disobeyed My Lord, I would fear the torment of a Terrible Day.’"
The Troops,39,14,Say: ‘I worship Allah alone making obedience purely for Him.
The Troops,39,15,"So worship what you like besides Allah.’ Say: ‘Surely, losers are only those who will bring loss to their own souls and their families on the Day of Resurrection. Remember! That truly is the manifest loss."
The Troops,39,16,For them there will be clouds of fire (as covers) over them and pavements of fire beneath them too. This is (the torment) with which Allah warns His servants.’ O My servants! Always fear Me.
The Troops,39,17,"And those who kept off from idol-worship and turned to Allah, for them is good news. So give glad tidings to My servants."
The Troops,39,18,"Those who listen attentively to what is said, then follow the best in it, it is they whom Allah has given guidance, and it is they who have wisdom."
The Troops,39,19,But can you save him for whom the command of torment has become due and who has become the inmate of Hell (for ever)?
The Troops,39,20,But for those who fear their Lord are lofty palaces (in Paradise) with lofty mansions built over and rivers flowing beneath. This is Allah’s promise. Allah does not go against His promise.
The Troops,39,21,"(O man!) Have you not seen that Allah showered water from the sky, then made it sprout from the earth as water springs? Then He brings forth with it crops of various colours. Then (growing fully) it dries up. Then, (ripening,) you see it turns yellow. Then He reduces it to broken straw. Surely, there is advice in it for the wise."
The Troops,39,22,Well! He whose breast Allah has opened for Islam is (stationed) in the light from his Lord. (But on the contrary) those whose hearts are hardened for (being deprived of the bounty of) Allah’s remembrance are destined to ruin. It is they who are in open error.
The Troops,39,23,"Allah is the One Who has sent down the best Word. That is a Book whose contents are in harmony with one another (in format and meaning) and (whose Verses) are repeated frequently. It sends a hair-raising shudder in the bodies of those who fear their Lord. Then their skins and hearts get softened, and they get (absorbed) into the remembrance of Allah (in a weeping mood). It is guidance from Allah and He guides with it whom He wills. And he whom Allah holds misguided (i.e., leaves astray) has no one to guide him."
The Troops,39,24,"Well, on the Day of Resurrection, (what will be the plight of the one) who will be trying to halt the evil torment (of the Fire) with his face (because both his hands will be fastened)? And it will be said to these wrongdoers: ‘Taste the consequence of the evil deeds that you used to do.’"
The Troops,39,25,"The people who passed before them rejected (the Messengers), so the torment came upon them whence they had no perception."
The Troops,39,26,"So Allah made them taste disgrace and humiliation (here) in this world, and surely the torment of the Hereafter is far greater. Would that they knew!"
The Troops,39,27,"And truly, (to make the people understand,) We have given every kind of example in this Qur’an in order that they may take advice."
The Troops,39,28,"The Qur’an is in the Arabic language (which is the most comprehensive, lucid and communicative of all the languages) in which there is not even a bit of crookedness so that they may adopt Godwariness."
The Troops,39,29,Allah has given an example of such a (slave) person that is owned by many partners who are ill-mannered and mutually quarrelsome as well. And (on the other side) there is a person who is a slave only to one master. Can they both be alike? (Not at all!) All praise belongs to Allah alone. But most of them do not know (the truth of the Oneness of Allah).
The Troops,39,30,"(O My Esteemed Beloved!) Surely, you will pass away (only to taste death) but they will certainly die (for everlasting death.* So the difference between the two deaths will be worth seeing)."
The Troops,39,31,"Then, certainly, on the Day of Resurrection you will dispute with one another in the presence of your Lord. (One party will say to the other: ‘You stopped us from understanding the station of the Prophet and the glory of the Messenger.’ They will reply: ‘No, you were yourselves ill-fated and misguided.’)"
The Troops,39,32,So who is more unjust than he who invents lies against Allah and denies the truth when it comes to him? Is the abode for disbelievers not in Hell?
The Troops,39,33,"And whoever has brought the truth and he who has confirmed it, it is they who are Godfearing."
The Troops,39,34,"(All) those (favours) which they will long for (are in store) for them with their Lord. This is the reward of those who are committed to spiritual excellence,"
The Troops,39,35,"So that Allah removes from them errors which they did, and grants them the reward for the pious deeds they used to do."
The Troops,39,36,"Is Allah not enough for His (most intimate) servant (the Esteemed Prophet [blessings and peace be upon him])? And these (disbelievers) frighten you, apart from Allah, with the idols (which they worship). And there is no one to guide him whom Allah holds astray (owing to his denial of the truth)."
The Troops,39,37,"And he whom Allah blesses with guidance, there is none to misguide him. Is Allah not Almighty, the Lord of Vengeance?"
The Troops,39,38,"And if you ask them: ‘Who has created the heavens and the earth?’ they will certainly say: ‘Allah.’ Say: ‘Well, speak up, can the idols that you worship besides Allah remove the suffering which Allah may intend to inflict upon me, or if Allah intends to grant me mercy, can they (the idols) stop that mercy (sent by Him)?’ Say: ‘Allah is Sufficient for me. The trusting ones put their trust in Him alone.’"
The Troops,39,39,"Say: ‘O (my) people! Carry on working according to your way; I am working (according to my way). Then you will soon know (the end),"
The Troops,39,40,"(That) who is afflicted with the torment that will disgrace him, and everlasting torment will come down upon him.’"
The Troops,39,41,"Surely, We revealed the Book to you with the truth for (the guidance of) people. So he who takes guidance takes it for his own benefit, and he who goes astray, he strays to his own detriment. And you are not responsible for them."
The Troops,39,42,"Allah takes away souls at the time of their death and those whose death has not yet arrived during their sleep. Then He withholds those souls whose death He has ordained and sets other (souls) free till an appointed time. Surely, in it are signs for those who contemplate."
The Troops,39,43,"Have they taken (idols as) intercessors against Allah’s leave? Say: ‘Even though they do not own anything, nor do they have any reason?’"
The Troops,39,44,Say: ‘(The leave for) all intercession rests with Allah alone (which He has specified for His intimate servants). The sovereignty of the heavens and the earth also belongs to Him alone. Then to Him you will be returned.’
The Troops,39,45,"And when Allah alone is mentioned, the hearts of those who do not believe in the Hereafter constrict and recoil with disgust, and when the idols (that they worship) are mentioned apart from Allah, they rejoice all of a sudden."
The Troops,39,46,Say: ‘O Allah! Originator of the heavens and the earth! Knower of the unseen and the seen! You alone will judge between Your servants those (matters) wherein they used to disagree.’
The Troops,39,47,"And if the wrongdoers possessed all (the wealth and assets) that are on earth and (obtained) the same again in addition, they would ransom themselves with it (for deliverance) from the evil torment on the Day of Resurrection. But there will appear to them from Allah such a torment as they could never have even imagined."
The Troops,39,48,"And there will appear to them (all) the evildoings which they have earned, and that (torment) will encompass them which they used to laugh at."
The Troops,39,49,"When some suffering touches man, he cries to Us. But when We grant him some favour from Us, he starts saying: ‘This favour has come to me on (the basis of my own) knowledge and planning.’ In fact, it is a trial, but most of them do not know."
The Troops,39,50,"In truth, those who have passed away before them also used to say the same (things). So whatever they earned could not benefit them."
The Troops,39,51,"And the evil deeds which they had done fell upon them, and those of them who are engaged in doing wrongs, their evil works that they have earned will (also) catch up with them soon and they cannot prevent (Allah)."
The Troops,39,52,"And do they not know that Allah gives abundantly to whom He wills and sparingly (to whom He wills)? Surely, in that are signs for those who (truly) believe."
The Troops,39,53,"Say: ‘O servants of Mine who have wronged their souls, do not lose hope of Allah’s mercy. Assuredly, Allah forgives all sins (and excesses). He is certainly Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful."
The Troops,39,54,And turn to your Lord in repentance and total submission and become thoroughly obedient to Him before the torment comes upon you. Then you will not be helped at all.
The Troops,39,55,"And follow the Excellent (Book) that has been revealed to you by your Lord before the torment suddenly comes upon you and you are simply unaware,"
The Troops,39,56,(Lest) someone should say: ‘Alas! Woe to me for my lapse and neglect of my duty (of obedience) to Allah and I was certainly of those who mocked.’
The Troops,39,57,"Or should say: ‘If Allah had given me guidance, I would certainly have been of the righteous.’"
The Troops,39,58,"Or should say on seeing the torment: ‘Would that I was able to return to the world but once, I would then become one of the pious.’"
The Troops,39,59,"(The Lord will say:) ‘Yes, no doubt, My Revelations came to you. So you rejected them and showed arrogance and became one of the disbelievers.’"
The Troops,39,60,"And on the Day of Resurrection, you will see those who have fabricated a lie against Allah that their faces are darkened. Is the abode of the arrogant not in Hell?"
The Troops,39,61,"And those who have adopted Godwariness, Allah will deliver them bestowing success on them. No evil will touch them, nor will they grieve at all."
The Troops,39,62,Allah is the Creator of everything and He is Ever-Watchful over everything.
The Troops,39,63,"To Him alone belong the keys of the heavens and the earth, and those who disbelieve in the Revelations of Allah, it is they who are the losers."
The Troops,39,64,"Say: ‘O you ignoramuses, do you ask me to worship someone other than Allah?’"
The Troops,39,65,"And in truth (this) revelation has been sent to you and to those (Messengers as well) who were (raised) before you: ‘(O man,) if you associate partners with Allah, then all your works will go to waste, and you will certainly be amongst the losers.’"
The Troops,39,66,"So, worship Allah and be amongst the thankful."
The Troops,39,67,"And they did not realize true appreciation and veneration of Allah’s Glory as was due. And the whole earth will be in His grip on the Day of Resurrection, and all the heavenly spheres will be rolled up in His right hand (i.e., firm hold of His Might). Holy is He and High and Exalted above all that they associate with Him."
The Troops,39,68,And the Trumpet will be blown. Then all the people that are in the heavens and that are in the earth will become senseless except him whom Allah wills. Then the Trumpet will be blown again; so they will stand up gazing all at once.
The Troops,39,69,"And the earth (on the Day of Judgment) will be illumined with the Light of its Lord, and the Book (of everyone’s deeds) will be laid down. And the Prophets and the witnesses will be brought, and judgment will be given between the people with truth and justice. And they will not be done any wrong."
The Troops,39,70,"And everyone will be given recompense in full for his doings, and He Knows full well what they do."
The Troops,39,71,"And those who have disbelieved will be driven to Hell in groups until, when they approach it (Hell), its gates will be opened and its keepers will say to them: ‘Did Messengers not come to you from amongst yourselves who recited to you the Verses of your Lord and warned you of this Day’s appearance?’ They (the inmates of Hell) will say: ‘Yes, (they came).’ But the command of torment will have been carried out against the disbelievers."
The Troops,39,72,It will be said to them: ‘Enter the gates of Hell. (You) will live in it for ever. So how evil is the abode of the arrogant!’
The Troops,39,73,"And those who persisted in fear of Allah will (also) be conducted to Paradise in groups until, when they approach it (Paradise), its doors will have been opened for them (well before) and the keepers of Paradise will say, (greeting them): ‘Peace be upon you! Be glad and rejoice, and enter it to dwell here forever.’"
The Troops,39,74,"And they (the residents of Paradise) will say: ‘All praise belongs to Allah alone, Who has fulfilled His promise to us, and has made us inheritors of the land of Paradise that we may reside in (this) Paradise wherever we desire.’ So how excellent is the reward of those who do righteous acts!"
The Troops,39,75,"And, (O Beloved,) you will see the angels all around the Throne in circles glorifying the Lord with His praise, and the judgment will be given amongst (all) the people with truth and justice and it will be announced: ‘All praise belongs to Allah alone, the Sustainer of all the worlds.’"
The Believer,40,1,"Ha, Mim. (Only Allah and the Messenger [blessings and peace be upon him] know the real meaning.)"
The Believer,40,2,"The revelation of this Book is from Allah, the Almighty, All-Knowing,"
The Believer,40,3,"The Forgiver of sin, the Acceptor of repentance, the Severe in tormenting, the Lord of bounty; there is no God but He; towards Him (all) are to return."
The Believer,40,4,No one disputes about the Revelations of Allah except those who do not believe. So let not their moving about (freely) in the cities delude you.
The Believer,40,5,"Before them the people of Nuh (Noah) and after them many (other) communities rejected (their Messengers). And every people intended to seize its Messenger (to assassinate or imprison him), and raised dispute through baseless issues to dilute (the influence of) the truth by means of that (dispute). So I seized them (in torment). So how was (My) torment!"
The Believer,40,6,"That is how the judgment of your Lord was fulfilled against those who disbelieved. Surely, they are the inmates of Hell."
The Believer,40,7,"The angels who are bearing the Throne and those who are around it, (all) glorify their Lord with His praise and believe in Him and pray for forgiveness of the believers (and submit): ‘O our Lord, You encompass everything in (Your) mercy and knowledge. So forgive those who turn to You in repentance and follow Your path and protect them from the torment of Hell."
The Believer,40,8,"O our Lord! And admit them to the Gardens of Eden (for eternal living) You have promised them. And (also admit with them) the pious ones of their fathers and their wives and their children. Surely, You are Almighty, Most Wise."
The Believer,40,9,"And save them from (the punishment of) sins. And the one You have saved from (the punishment of) sins that Day, You have indeed shown him great mercy. And that is great success indeed.’"
The Believer,40,10,"Surely, the disbelievers will be called out and addressed: ‘(Today) Allah’s displeasure with you is greater than your own disgust for yourselves whilst you used to deny when called to believe.’"
The Believer,40,11,"They will say: ‘O our Lord, You have caused us to die twice and You have (also) given us life twice. (Now) we confess our sins. So is there any way out (to escape from this chastisement)?’"
The Believer,40,12,"(It will be said to them: ‘No,) this (eternal punishment) is because, when Allah alone was called upon, you used to deny, but when (something) was associated with Him, you used to believe. So (now) the command is Allah’s alone, Who is Most High, Supreme.’"
The Believer,40,13,He is the One Who shows you His signs and sends down sustenance for you from the heaven. And only he who remains inclined (to Allah alone) accepts advice.
The Believer,40,14,"So worship Allah for His own sake in sincere obedience and true devotion, even though the disbelievers may despise it."
The Believer,40,15,"The Exalter of Ranks and the Owner of the Mighty Throne, He sends His Spirit (i.e., Revelation) upon whomever of His servants He wills by His command, so that He warns them (people) of the Day of Assembly,"
The Believer,40,16,"The Day when they all will come forth (from the graves), and nothing of their (deeds) will remain hidden from Allah, (He will say:) ‘Whose is the Kingdom this Day?’ (It will be further added:) ‘It belongs to Allah, the One, the Most Dominant.’"
The Believer,40,17,"Today every soul will be rewarded for what it has earned. There will be no injustice Today. Surely, Allah is Swift in taking an account."
The Believer,40,18,And warn them of the Day of impending calamity when hearts will rise to throats due to the suppressed grief. The wrongdoers will have neither any kind friend nor any influential intercessor.
The Believer,40,19,"He knows the treacherous eyes, and also those secrets which the breasts hide (inside them)."
The Believer,40,20,"And Allah judges with truth, and the (idols) they worship other than Allah can judge nothing at all. Surely, Allah is the One Who is All-Hearing, All-Seeing."
The Believer,40,21,"And have they not travelled in the land so that they could see what was the end of those who were before them? They were far mightier in power than these and (also) greater in their remains and signs (which they left behind) in the earth. Then Allah seized them for their sins, and there was none to protect them from (the torment of) Allah."
The Believer,40,22,"That was because their Messengers brought them open signs but they denied. So Allah seized them (in the torment). Surely, He is All-Powerful, Most Severe in punishing."
The Believer,40,23,"And indeed We sent Musa (Moses) with Our signs and a clear authority,"
The Believer,40,24,"Towards Pharaoh, Haman and Qarun (Korah) but they said: ‘He is a sorcerer, a great liar.’"
The Believer,40,25,"Then when he came to them with the message of truth from Us, they said: ‘Kill the sons of those who have believed with him but leave their women alive.’ And the treacherous plots of the disbelievers were nothing but ruination. (They massacred the generations of peaceful community.)"
The Believer,40,26,"And (blind to his own transgression, tyranny and brutality) Pharaoh said: ‘Leave me to kill Musa (Moses) and let him call his Lord. I fear he will change your religion or will spread violence in the country (Egypt).’"
The Believer,40,27,And Musa (Moses) said: ‘I have taken refuge with my Lord and your Lord from every arrogant character who does not believe in the Day of Reckoning.’
The Believer,40,28,"And a believing man amongst the people of Pharaoh who had kept his faith secret said, ‘Do you kill a man (just) because he says: Allah is my Lord? And he has brought you clear signs from your Lord. And (suppose) if he is a liar, then the burden of his lie will fall back on him alone, but if he is truthful, then as much torment is bound to seize you as he has promised you. Surely, Allah does not give guidance to someone who exceeds limits and is a downright liar."
The Believer,40,29,"O my people! You are in power today; (it is you who) are ruling over the land (of Egypt). But who can save us from the torment of Allah if that (torment) comes upon us?’ Pharaoh said: ‘I instruct you only what I myself deem (correct), and I do not show you (any path) except the path of righteousness.’"
The Believer,40,30,"And he who had embraced faith said: ‘O my people, I fear (the torment of) an evil day coming upon you (too) like the day that seized (the former) generations,"
The Believer,40,31,"On the pattern of the punishment of the people of Nuh (Noah), ‘Ad and Thamud and the later communities. And Allah does not intend any injustice to (His) servants."
The Believer,40,32,"And, O people, I fear for you a Day of Hue and Cry (i.e., the Day of Rising),"
The Believer,40,33,"The Day when you will turn your backs and flee away, and there will be no one to save you from (the torment of) Allah, and for him whom Allah holds astray there is no guide or leader."
The Believer,40,34,"And, (O people of Egypt,) no doubt Yusuf (Joseph) came to you with clear signs before this. And you always remained doubtful about those (signs) which he brought to you until, when he passed away, you started saying: ‘Now Allah will never send any Messenger after him.’ In like manner, Allah holds one astray who is a transgressor and a sceptic,"
The Believer,40,35,"Those who argue about the Revelations of Allah without any proof that has come to them, (their argumentation) is awfully displeasing in the sight of Allah and in the sight of believers. That is how Allah seals up the heart of every arrogant (and) tyrant.’"
The Believer,40,36,"And Pharaoh said: ‘O Haman, build me a towering palace so that (climbing it) I may reach the tracts,"
The Believer,40,37,"The tracts to the heavens; then I may peer and glance at the God of Musa (Moses); and I consider him but a liar.’ And in this way, the evil conduct of Pharaoh was made charming for him and he was hindered from the path (of Allah). And the treacherous plan of Pharaoh was nothing but a catastrophe."
The Believer,40,38,"And the man who had believed said: ‘O my people, follow me, I will lead you to the path of guidance and piousness."
The Believer,40,39,"O my people! The life of this world is nothing but (a few days’) gain, and the Hereafter is certainly a home to live in forever."
The Believer,40,40,"He who commits evil will not be rewarded but with the same measure. And whoever behaves piously, whether male or female, and is a believer as well, it is they who will enter Paradise. There they will be given sustenance without measure."
The Believer,40,41,"And, O my people, why is it that I call you to salvation and you call me to Hell?"
The Believer,40,42,"You invite me to deny Allah, and associate with Him that of which I have no knowledge, whilst I invite you to the Almighty God, Who is Most Forgiving."
The Believer,40,43,"The truth is that what you are calling me to is not worth calling either in this world or in the Hereafter. And surely, our return is to Allah alone, and certainly those who transgress are the inmates of Hell."
The Believer,40,44,"So you will soon recall (these words) that I am saying to you. And I consign my affair to Allah. Surely, Allah is Ever-Watchful of the servants.’"
The Believer,40,45,Then Allah safeguarded him against their evils which they were planning. And an evil torment engulfed the people of Pharaoh.
The Believer,40,46,They are brought before the Fire of Hell morning and evening. And the Day when Resurrection occurs (a voice will command:) ‘Cast the people of Pharaoh into the most miserable chastisement.’
The Believer,40,47,"And when they will fall out with one another in Hell, the weak will say to those who used to show arrogance (in the world): ‘We were your followers, so can you remove from us (even) a portion of the Fire of Hell?’"
The Believer,40,48,"Those who practised arrogance will say: ‘We all are doomed in the same Hell; surely, Allah has given His final judgment amongst the servants.’"
The Believer,40,49,And those burning in the Fire will say to the keepers of Hell: ‘Pray to your Lord that He lessens our torment some day.’
The Believer,40,50,"They will say: ‘Did your Messengers not come to you with clear signs?’ They will reply: ‘Yes, of course.’ (Then the keepers) will say: ‘So pray yourselves.’ But the disbelievers’ prayer will (always) be in vain."
The Believer,40,51,"Surely, We help Our Messengers and those who believe both in the life of this world and on the Day when the witnesses will rise,"
The Believer,40,52,"The Day when the excuse of the wrongdoers will not benefit them. And there will be the curse on them, and for them will be the evil home (in Hell)."
The Believer,40,53,"And verily We gave Musa ([Moses] the Book of) guidance, and (after him) We made the Children of Israel the inheritors of that (Book),"
The Believer,40,54,A guidance and a reminder for those who possess wisdom.
The Believer,40,55,"So keep patience. Assuredly, the promise of Allah is true. And ask forgiveness for the sins of your Umma (Community),* and glorify your Lord with His praise in the evening and in the morning."
The Believer,40,56,"Surely, those who argue about the Revelations of Allah without any authority having come to them, there is nothing in their breasts except vain superiority; they will never be able to attain to that (true superiority). So keep seeking refuge with Allah (from their evil). Surely, He alone is All-Hearing, All-Seeing."
The Believer,40,57,"Surely, the creation of the heavens and the earth is far greater than the creation of mankind but most people do not know."
The Believer,40,58,And the blind and the seeing cannot be equal. So (in the same way) those who believe and do righteous works and the evildoers cannot be (alike). You accept direction and guidance but little.
The Believer,40,59,"Surely, the Last Hour is bound to come. There is no doubt in that. Yet most people do not believe."
The Believer,40,60,"And your Lord has said: ‘Always pray to Me; I shall certainly grant your prayer. Surely, those who turn away from My worship in defiance will soon enter Hell disgraced.’"
The Believer,40,61,"Allah is the One Who has made the night for you to repose in and brightened the day to see; surely, Allah is Bountiful to mankind but most people do not give thanks."
The Believer,40,62,"That is Allah, your Lord, Who is the Creator of everything. There is no God apart from Him. So where are you wandering disorientated?"
The Believer,40,63,"Likewise, those who used to deny the Revelations of Allah were wandering distracted."
The Believer,40,64,"Allah is the One Who made the earth a dwelling place for you and the heaven a ceiling and gave you form and features and then perfected your shapes and granted you sustenance of pure things. Such is Allah, your Lord. So Blessed is Allah, the Lord of all the worlds."
The Believer,40,65,"He is the Ever-Living. There is no God but He. So worship Him, making obedience and devotion sincerely His. All praise belongs to Allah alone, the Lord of all the worlds."
The Believer,40,66,"Say: ‘I have been forbidden to worship those idols that you worship apart from Allah, whereas manifest signs have come to me from my Lord, and I have been commanded to obey the Lord of all the worlds.’"
The Believer,40,67,"He is the One Who initiated (the genesis of) your (chemical life) from clay, then (your biological genesis) from a sperm drop (zygote), then from a hanging mass (in the mother’s womb). Then (eventually) He is the One Who brings you forth as an infant, then (nourishes you), so that you may reach your maturity. (Then He grants you a period of life) so that you may grow old. And some of you die early (before senility). And (the purpose of all this is) that you may complete your respective appointed terms and (also) that you may comprehend."
The Believer,40,68,"He is the One Who gives life and causes death. Then when He decides upon a thing, He says to it only: ‘Be,’ so it becomes."
The Believer,40,69,Have you not seen those who argue about the Revelations of Allah? Where are they straying?
The Believer,40,70,"Those who have rejected the Book (as well as) the signs with which We sent Our Messengers, they will know (their end) soon,"
The Believer,40,71,"When they have iron collars round their necks and chains, and they will be dragged away,"
The Believer,40,72,Into the boiling water and then will be thrown into the Fire as fuel.
The Believer,40,73,"Then it will be said to them: ‘Where are those (idols) which you used to set up as partners,"
The Believer,40,74,"Apart from Allah?’ They will say: ‘They have been lost from us. In fact, we never worshipped anything before.’ That is how Allah holds the disbelievers astray."
The Believer,40,75,This (punishment) is the requital of your undue rejoicing in the earth and the recompense of your gloating.
The Believer,40,76,Enter the gates of Hell. You will live in it forever. So how evil is the abode of the arrogant!
The Believer,40,77,"So keep patience. Surely, Allah’s promise is true. Then whether We show you a portion of that (torment) which We have promised them, or make you depart from the visible life before that, (in both cases) they will be returned to Us."
The Believer,40,78,"And no doubt We sent many Messengers before you. We have given you an account of some of them whilst We have not (yet) narrated to you the annals of some others. And it was not possible for any Messenger to bring any sign without Allah’s leave. Then when the command of Allah came (and) the judgment was given with truth and justice, the exponents of evil went into loss."
The Believer,40,79,Allah is the One Who has created cattle for you so that you may ride some of them and some of them you eat.
The Believer,40,80,"And in them are for you other benefits too. So you may ride them (further) to reach that desired (place) which is (determined) in your hearts, and (that) you are borne on them and the boats."
The Believer,40,81,And He shows you (many of) His signs. So which of Allah’s signs will you deny?
The Believer,40,82,So have they not travelled in the earth that they could see how they who passed before them met their fate? They were far greater (in number) than these people and mightier in power and (much more advanced) in respect of the remains and traces (as well) that (they) have left behind in the earth (as archeological sites). But whatever they used to earn brought them no benefit.
The Believer,40,83,"So when their Messengers came to them with manifest signs, they kept rejoicing in the pride of (the worldly) knowledge and skill they possessed. And (in the same state) that torment which they used to mock engulfed them."
The Believer,40,84,"But when they saw Our torment, they started saying: ‘We believe in Allah, the One, and reject (all) those we used to associate with Him as partners.’"
The Believer,40,85,"Then their acceptance of faith could not profit them at all whilst they had seen Our torment. That is Allah’s way which has always been in practice in respect of His servants, and the disbelievers always suffered heavy loss at this juncture."
"Fussilat (""They are Expounded"")",41,1,Ha-Mim. (Only Allah and the Messenger [blessings and peace be upon him] know the real meaning.)
"Fussilat (""They are Expounded"")",41,2,"(It is) sent down from the Most Kind (Lord), the Ever-Merciful,"
"Fussilat (""They are Expounded"")",41,3,"A Book whose signs are expounded in detail, the Qur’an, in the Arabic (language) for a people who possess knowledge and wisdom,"
"Fussilat (""They are Expounded"")",41,4,A Bearer of good news and a Warner. Then most of them turned away. So they do not listen (to it).
"Fussilat (""They are Expounded"")",41,5,"And they say: ‘Our hearts are in covers against that to which you call us, and in our ears is heaviness (of deafness), and between us and you is a barrier. So you keep doing (your) work and we do our work.’"
"Fussilat (""They are Expounded"")",41,6,"(To remove their barrier and to inspire them to listen,) say: ‘(O disbelievers!) Well, being a human outwardly, I am like you. (Then why are you so averse to me and my call?) This Revelation has been sent down to me that your God is One God, so be straight turned towards Him alone and seek forgiveness from Him. And destruction awaits those who associate partners with Him,"
"Fussilat (""They are Expounded"")",41,7,"Those who do not pay Zakat (the Alms-due), and it is they who deny the Hereafter as well."
"Fussilat (""They are Expounded"")",41,8,"Surely, those who believe and do righteous works persistently, for them is endless reward."
"Fussilat (""They are Expounded"")",41,9,"Say: ‘Do you deny Him (Allah) Who created the earth in two days (i.e., two time-lengths) and set up peers with Him? He is the One Who is the Lord of all the worlds.’"
"Fussilat (""They are Expounded"")",41,10,"And He placed over it heavy mountains (brought forth) from within it and treasured in it (His infinite) blessings (minerals, water reservoirs, natural resources and other substances and forces and energies) and provided and appointed in it sustenance (i.e., necessities of life for all the creatures. He) accomplished (all that) in four days (i.e., four evolutionary periods. All of this sustenance is in fact) equal for all seekers (and the needy)."
"Fussilat (""They are Expounded"")",41,11,Then He turned towards the heavenly universe—that was (all) smoke. So He said to it (the heavenly spheres) and the earth: ‘Get in (compliance with Our system) either under the influence of mutual attraction and coordination or under aversion and revulsion.’ Both said: ‘We submit with pleasure.’
"Fussilat (""They are Expounded"")",41,12,"Then He made seven heavens in two days (i.e., two phases), and endued every heavenly universe with its (built-in) system. And We adorned the lower heaven with lamps (i.e., stars and planets), and made it secure as well (so that the system of one may not interfere with the other). This is the system programmed by the Lord of Absolute Dominance (and Might), the All-Knowing (Lord)."
"Fussilat (""They are Expounded"")",41,13,"Then if they turn away, say: ‘I warn you of a terrible torment like the destruction of ‘Ad and Thamud.’"
"Fussilat (""They are Expounded"")",41,14,"When the Messengers came to them from their front and from their rear (or before them and after them and said:) ‘Worship none but Allah,’ they said: ‘Had our Lord willed, He would have sent down angels. So we deny whatever you have been sent with.’"
"Fussilat (""They are Expounded"")",41,15,"As for the people of ‘Ad, they were unrightfully arrogant (and rebellious) in the land and said: ‘Who is greater in might than we are?’ And have they not seen that Allah, Who has created them, is far mightier in power than they are? And they kept denying Our Revelations."
"Fussilat (""They are Expounded"")",41,16,"So We sent upon them an appalling and violent wind during ill-omened days to make them taste the torment of humiliation in the worldly life, and the torment of the Hereafter will be far more degrading. And they will not be helped at all."
"Fussilat (""They are Expounded"")",41,17,"And as for the people of Thamud, We showed them the path of guidance, but they preferred blindness to guidance. So a blast of humiliating devastation seized them for the deeds that they used to earn."
"Fussilat (""They are Expounded"")",41,18,And We delivered those who believed and performed acts of piety (and self-protection).
"Fussilat (""They are Expounded"")",41,19,"And the Day when the enemies of Allah will be gathered and driven to Hell, they will be impeded (i.e., shepherded) and driven (forcefully),"
"Fussilat (""They are Expounded"")",41,20,"Until, when they reach Hell, their ears, their eyes and their skins will bear witness against them concerning the works that they used to do."
"Fussilat (""They are Expounded"")",41,21,"Then they will say to their skins: ‘Why did you bear witness against us?’ They will say: ‘Allah, Who gives speech to everything, has enabled us to speak. And He is the One Who created you the first time, and you will be returned to Him alone.’"
"Fussilat (""They are Expounded"")",41,22,"(Whilst committing the sin) you did not take any cover even against this (fear) that your ears would bear witness against you and (that) your eyes and (that) your skins (might even bear witness), but you imagined that even Allah did not know many of the deeds that you do."
"Fussilat (""They are Expounded"")",41,23,And it is this notion that you developed about your Lord which ruined you. So you became of the losers.
"Fussilat (""They are Expounded"")",41,24,"Now even if they keep patience, their abode is Hell; and if they seek to earn (Allah’s) pleasure (by turning to Him in repentance), even then they will not be amongst those who attain to Allah’s pleasure."
"Fussilat (""They are Expounded"")",41,25,"And We appointed for them companions (satans). So they made (all those deeds) fair seeming to them which were in their front and in their rear. And the same command of torment proved true against them that had gone forth against the communities of jinn and mankind that had passed before them. Surely, they were the losers."
"Fussilat (""They are Expounded"")",41,26,"And the disbelievers say: ‘Do not listen to this Qur’an, but make noises in (its recitation sessions), so that you may overwhelm (their recitation from the Qur’an).’"
"Fussilat (""They are Expounded"")",41,27,"So We will most certainly make the disbelievers taste the severe torment, and will most certainly requite them for the evil deeds which they used to do."
"Fussilat (""They are Expounded"")",41,28,This Hell is the recompense of the enemies of Allah. There is a home in it for them to dwell in forever—a requital for their denial of Our Revelations.
"Fussilat (""They are Expounded"")",41,29,"And those who disbelieved will say: ‘O our Lord, show us those of the jinn and men who led us astray, so that we may (crush) them under our feet, and so that they may become of the most humiliated ones.’"
"Fussilat (""They are Expounded"")",41,30,"Surely, those who say: ‘Our Lord is Allah,’ then stick to it (firmly), angels descend upon them (and say:) ‘Do not fear or grieve, and rejoice in the Paradise that you were promised."
"Fussilat (""They are Expounded"")",41,31,We are your friends and helpers in the life of this world and in the Hereafter (too). And there is for you every blessing that you long for. And all those things that you ask for are (available) for you there.
"Fussilat (""They are Expounded"")",41,32,"(This) is hospitality from the Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful (Lord).’"
"Fussilat (""They are Expounded"")",41,33,"And who can be more pleasing in speech than one who calls towards Allah and does pious work and says: ‘Surely, I am of the obedient servants (of Allah and the Holy Prophet)’?"
"Fussilat (""They are Expounded"")",41,34,And good and evil cannot be equal. And remove the evil in a better (way) with the result that the one with whom you had rivalry becomes your most warmhearted friend.
"Fussilat (""They are Expounded"")",41,35,And this (virtue) is granted only to those who observe patience. And only he who is blessed with a large share of bounty acquires this (capability).
"Fussilat (""They are Expounded"")",41,36,"And, (O believing servant,) if an evil whisper of Satan stirs your mind, seek refuge with Allah; surely, He is All-Hearing, All-Knowing."
"Fussilat (""They are Expounded"")",41,37,"And of His signs are the night and the day and the sun and the moon. So prostrate yourselves neither before the sun nor before the moon. But fall down in prostration only before Allah, Who has created them (all), if He is the One Whom you worship."
"Fussilat (""They are Expounded"")",41,38,"Then if they show arrogance (do not care for them). So the angels that are in the presence of your Lord glorify Him night and day, and never are they tired (and disgruntled)."
"Fussilat (""They are Expounded"")",41,39,"And of His signs is also that you (first) see the earth dry (and worthless), but when We rain water on it, it becomes green and fresh and brings forth vegetation. Surely, He Who has brought this (dead earth) to life again, certainly He is the One Who will give life to the dead (on the Day of Resurrection). Surely, He has Absolute Power over everything."
"Fussilat (""They are Expounded"")",41,40,"Verily, those who turn away from the straight path with regard to (the meanings of) Our Verses are not hidden from Us. Then, is he who is thrown into the Fire of Hell better, or someone who comes safe and secure (from the torment) on the Day of Resurrection? Do as you wish. Surely, He sees all that you do."
"Fussilat (""They are Expounded"")",41,41,"Indeed, those who disbelieved in the Qur’an when it had come to them, (that is their ill fortune). And surely, it (the Qur’an) is a Mighty, Venerable Book."
"Fussilat (""They are Expounded"")",41,42,"Falsehood can approach it (the Qur’an) neither from before nor from behind. (It) has been sent down by the Most Wise, the Most Praiseworthy (Lord)."
"Fussilat (""They are Expounded"")",41,43,"(O Beloved!) Whatever is said to you are the same words that have been said to the Messengers before you. Surely, your Lord is Most Forgiving and the Master of agonizing chastisement (as well)."
"Fussilat (""They are Expounded"")",41,44,"And if We had revealed this (Book) as a Qur’an in a non-Arabic language, they would certainly have said: ‘Why have its Verses not been expounded expressly? Is the Book non-Arabic and the Prophet an Arab?’ (So, O Esteemed Beloved, We have revealed the Qur’an also in your language.) Say: ‘That (Qur’an) is guidance as well as healing for the believers, but those who do not believe, their ears are heavy with deafness, and that is blindness (as well) in their case, (as if) they are like men called from afar.’"
"Fussilat (""They are Expounded"")",41,45,"And verily, We gave the Book to Musa (Moses), but disagreement was perpetrated in that (too). And had not a command already been given by your Lord, the matter would have been judged between them. And surely, they are (suffering from) a deceitful doubt about this (Qur’an as well)."
"Fussilat (""They are Expounded"")",41,46,"Whoever does pious work does it for (the benefit) of his own self, and whoever commits sin, its (resultant evil suffering) will fall back on him alone. And your Lord is not at all unjust to His servants."
"Fussilat (""They are Expounded"")",41,47,"The knowledge of the Hour of Resurrection is referred to Him (Allah) alone. And no fruits come out of their sheath, nor does a female conceive or give birth to a child but (all this) is in His knowledge. And on the Day when He will call out to them: ‘Where are My partners?’ they (the polytheists) will say: ‘We submit that none of us is a witness (to anyone being Your partner).’"
"Fussilat (""They are Expounded"")",41,48,And all those (idols) that they used to worship will disappear from them. And they will make out that they are not left with any way to escape.
"Fussilat (""They are Expounded"")",41,49,"Man does not tire of praying for good, and if an evil touches him, he loses all hope—becomes a pessimist."
"Fussilat (""They are Expounded"")",41,50,"And if We give him a taste of mercy from Us after that misery which touched him, he surely starts saying: ‘This is my privilege. And I do not think that the Last Hour will ever take place. And if at all I am returned to my Lord, even then there will surely be good fortune for me in His presence.’ So We shall certainly inform the disbelievers of the deeds which they did, and We shall indeed make them taste the most severe torment."
"Fussilat (""They are Expounded"")",41,51,"And when We bestow a favour upon man, he turns his face away and, keeping withdrawn, strides far from Us. And when distress touches him, he entreats with lengthy prayers."
"Fussilat (""They are Expounded"")",41,52,"Say: ‘Well, give your view, if this (Qur’an) is really (sent down) from Allah and you keep denying it, then who is more astray than he who is (engaged) in extreme opposition?’"
"Fussilat (""They are Expounded"")",41,53,"We will soon show them Our signs all around the world and in their own selves, until it dawns on them that indeed this is the truth. Is your Lord not Sufficient (to confirm your veracity), for He alone is (also) witness to everything?"
"Fussilat (""They are Expounded"")",41,54,Beware that they are in doubt about the meeting with their Lord. Beware! He is the One Who encompasses everything (with His Knowledge and Power).
Counsel,42,1,"Ha-Mim,"
Counsel,42,2,"‘Ayn, Sin, Qaf. (Only Allah and the Messenger [blessings and peace be upon him] know the real meaning.)"
Counsel,42,3,"In like manner has Allah, Almighty, All-Wise, been sending His Revelations to you and to those (Messengers) who have passed before you."
Counsel,42,4,"To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth and He is Most High, Most Great."
Counsel,42,5,"The heavenly spheres are nearly rent asunder from above them. And the angels keep glorifying their Lord with His praise, and begging for forgiveness for those on the earth. Remember! Allah alone is Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful."
Counsel,42,6,"And those who have taken idols instead of Allah as their protectors and guardians, Allah is Ever-Watchful over their (affairs). And you are not responsible for them (the disbelievers)."
Counsel,42,7,"And likewise, We have revealed to you the Holy Qur’an in the Arabic language so that you may warn the residents of Mecca and its suburbs, and that you may warn them of the Day of Assembly about which there is no doubt. (On that Day) one party will be in Paradise and the other in Hell."
Counsel,42,8,"And had Allah so willed, He would have made all of them a single community. But He admits to His mercy whom He likes. And for the wrongdoers there will be no protector or guardian."
Counsel,42,9,"Have they taken idols as their guardians instead of Allah? So Allah alone is the Guardian. (And only His friends are Awliya’.) And He alone gives life to the dead, and He alone is Most Powerful over everything."
Counsel,42,10,"And the decision of the matter in which you differ rests only with Allah. That is Allah, my Lord. In Him I put my trust, and to Him alone I turn."
Counsel,42,11,"He has brought into existence the heavens and the earth from nothingness. He is the One Who made pairs for you from your own kind and made pairs of cattle as well, and with this (pairing) He multiplies and spreads you. There is nothing like Him and He alone is All-Hearing, All-Seeing."
Counsel,42,12,"To Him belong the keys of the heavens and the earth (i.e., He opens His treasures to whom He wills). He grants sustenance abundantly to whom He likes and sparingly (to whom He wills). Surely, He knows everything best."
Counsel,42,13,"He has prescribed for you the same path of the Din (Religion) that He enjoined on Nuh (Noah), and that We have revealed to you, and that We enjoined on Ibrahim (Abraham) and Musa (Moses) and ‘Isa (Jesus. And all it denotes is) that you should hold fast to the same Din (Religion) and do not make divisions in it. That (Oneness of Allah) to which you call them is quite hard for those who set up partners with Allah. Allah chooses whom He pleases (for exclusive nearness) in His presence, and shows the path to (come) towards Himself to everyone who turns (towards Allah) heartily."
Counsel,42,14,"And they did not break up into factions, but only after knowledge had reached them, merely on account of their mutual obstinacy (and stubbornness). And had the command of your Lord not gone forth concerning (a respite for) an appointed time, the judgment would have been given between them. And verily, those who were made inheritors of the Book after them are themselves in deceitful doubt about it."
Counsel,42,15,"So keep calling them to this (Din [Religion]), and hold fast (to it) as the command has been given to you. And do not give any heed to their desires and say (this): ‘I believe in every Book that Allah has revealed, and I have been commanded to do justice between you. Allah is our Lord as well as your Lord. For us are our deeds and for you are your deeds. There is no debate and dispute between us and you. Allah will gather us all together and to Him is the return (of all).’"
Counsel,42,16,"And those who dispute about (the Din [Religion] of) Allah after it has been accepted, their discussion and contention is false in the sight of their Lord. And upon them is the wrath (of Allah) and for them is a severe torment."
Counsel,42,17,Allah is He Who has revealed the Book with the truth and (also sent down) the balance (of equity and justice). And who has put you on alert—perhaps the Last Hour is near?
Counsel,42,18,"They who do not put (any) belief in it seek to hasten this (Hour), and those who believe fear it and know that its coming is the truth. Beware! Those who argue about the Hour are in extreme error."
Counsel,42,19,"Allah is Most Bountiful and Benevolent towards His servants. He bestows His sustenance and bounty upon whom He wills. And He is Most Strong, Almighty."
Counsel,42,20,"He who seeks the harvest of the Hereafter, We grant him further increase in his harvest. And he who desires the harvest of this world, We give him some of it, but in the Hereafter there does not remain any share for him."
Counsel,42,21,"Have they any (such) partners that have established for them a path of din (religion) about which Allah has not given any command? And had the command of judgment not (gone forth) already, the matter between them would have been settled. And surely, there is a painful torment for the wrongdoers."
Counsel,42,22,You will see the wrongdoers fearing those (deeds) that they have earned. And that (torment) is bound to befall them. And they who believe and persist in pious deeds will be in the Gardens of Paradise. There will be for them with their Lord (all those blessings) which they will long for. That is indeed a great bounty.
Counsel,42,23,"That is the (award) of which Allah gives the good news to those servants who believe and do pious works persistently. Say: ‘I do not ask for any recompense for this (preaching the faith in Messengership), but (seek) love for (my) kindreds (and Allah’s nearness).’ And whoever earns good, We shall increase for him the reward in the Hereafter. Surely, Allah is Most Forgiving, Most Appreciative."
Counsel,42,24,"Do they say that this (Messenger [blessings and peace be upon him]) has invented a lie against Allah? So if Allah wills, He may set a seal (of patience and steadfastness) on your holy heart (so that their absurd talk may not hurt you). And Allah eliminates falsehood and maintains the truth established by His Words. Surely, He knows best the secrets of the breasts."
Counsel,42,25,And He is the One Who accepts His servants’ repentance and forgives sins and knows what you do.
Counsel,42,26,"And He grants the prayers of those who believe and keep doing pious works, and gives them of His bounty more (than they pray for). But there is severe punishment for those who do not believe."
Counsel,42,27,"And if Allah were to expand sustenance for all His servants abundantly, they would surely transgress and revolt in the earth. But He sends it down as He pleases according to the measure (of needs). Surely, He is Best Aware of His servants’ (needs), All-Seeing."
Counsel,42,28,"And He is the One Who sends down rain after they lose hope and He spreads His mercy. And He, the Guardian, is Most Praiseworthy."
Counsel,42,29,"And amongst His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and (the creation) of the moving (i.e., living) creatures which He has scattered in them. And He is also Most Powerful to assemble them (all) when He wills."
Counsel,42,30,And whatever misfortune befalls you (comes upon you) as a result of that (evil work) which your own hands have done whilst He forgives most of your (misdoings).
Counsel,42,31,"And you cannot thwart Allah (anywhere) on earth (with your schemes). And, except Allah, none (of your idols) will be your guardian and helper."
Counsel,42,32,"And amongst His signs are the ships on the sea, high like mountains."
Counsel,42,33,"If He wills, He causes the wind to be absolutely still, and the vessels stand halted on the surface of the sea. Surely, there are signs in it for everyone who observes patience and remains grateful."
Counsel,42,34,Or He would drown those (vessels or ships) due to their (evil) deeds which they have earned but He forgives many (mistakes).
Counsel,42,35,And those who argue about Our Revelations should know that there is for them no way to escape.
Counsel,42,36,"And whatever (wealth and comforts) have been given to you is a small benefit for (a few days’) worldly life, and what is with Allah is better and everlasting. And (that) is for those who believe and put trust in their Lord,"
Counsel,42,37,"And those who refrain from major sins and the indecencies; and when they feel furious, they forgive;"
Counsel,42,38,"And those who submit to the command of their Lord, and establish prayer; and their decisions are made through mutual consultations; and they spend in Our way out of the provision which We have given them;"
Counsel,42,39,And those who take revenge when they are wronged (by a tyrant and wrongdoer).
Counsel,42,40,"And the requital of an evil is the like of that evil. Then he who forgives and (by forgiving) reforms, his reward is with Allah. Verily, He does not make friends with the wrongdoers."
Counsel,42,41,"And indeed, he who avenges the wrong that has been done to him, they will no way be (blamed and taken to task)."
Counsel,42,42,But the way (to persecute) is only against those who wrong the people and spread corruption and violence unjustly in the land. It is they for whom there is a painful torment.
Counsel,42,43,"And surely, he who keeps patience and forgives, this is certainly of the deeds that demand great courage and resolve."
Counsel,42,44,"And the one whom Allah holds astray, for him there is no protector after that. And you will see the wrongdoers; when they see the torment (of the Last Day), they will say: ‘Is there any way to go back (to the world)?’"
Counsel,42,45,"And you will see them brought to Hell with their heads bent with disgrace and fear, looking at it covertly (with a stealthy glance) and the believers will say: ‘Surely, the losers are those who put their own souls and their families into loss on the Day of Rising. Remember! Indeed, the wrongdoers will remain in (the agony of) a lasting torment."
Counsel,42,46,"And there will be no supporters for the (disbelievers) to help them against Allah. And he whom Allah holds astray, there is no way left for him (towards guidance)."
Counsel,42,47,Accept and submit to the command of your Lord before the Day comes for which there is no averting from Allah. There will be no shelter for you on that Day. Nor will there be any possibility for you to deny.
Counsel,42,48,"(Even) then if they turn away, We have not sent you with any responsibility for (saving) them (from destruction). You are responsible only to convey (the message of truth). And verily, when We make man taste (the savour) of mercy from Our presence, he feels pleased. But when some misfortune reaches them, owing to the (evil) deeds sent ahead by their own hands, then no doubt man (proves) to be highly ungrateful."
Counsel,42,49,For Allah alone is the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth. He creates what He likes. He blesses with girls whom He wills and blesses with boys whom He wills.
Counsel,42,50,"Or He gives them daughters and sons (both) and makes infertile whom He wills. Surely, he is All-Knowing, All-Powerful."
Counsel,42,51,"And every man does not have the faculty that Allah should speak to him (directly) except by Revelation (He bestows upon some the holy status of Prophethood), or (should speak) from behind a veil (as He spoke to Musa [Moses] on Mount Tur of Sinai), or by sending some angel as a messenger to reveal with His permission what Allah may will. (In any case, the medium and mediation of the communication of Allah’s Word for mankind is none but the Prophet and the Messenger.) Surely, He is Most High, Most Wise."
Counsel,42,52,"So thus We revealed to you Our Spirit (of hearts and souls) by Our command (that is the Qur’an). And (before the Revelation) you did not know what the Book was, nor did you know (through your own endeavour and insight the details of the injunctions of) faith (which were sent down and determined later).* But We made it a Light. By means of this Light, We give guidance to those of Our servants whom We intend. And assuredly, you alone provide guidance towards the straight path."
Counsel,42,53,(This straight path is) the path of Allah to Whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth. Beware! All matters return to Allah alone.

Ornaments of Gold,43,14,"And indeed, we are bound to return to our Lord.’"
Ornaments of Gold,43,15,"And those (polytheists) have made some of His servants His component (of divinity by declaring them His children). Verily, man is blatantly ungrateful."
Ornaments of Gold,43,16,(O disbelievers! Reply according to your calibre of thinking:) ‘Has He chosen (for Himself) daughters out of His Creation and has specified sons for you?’

Ornaments of Gold,43,20,"And they say: ‘If the Most Kind (Lord) had intended, we would not have worshipped these (idols).’ They do not know anything about this (as well). They only tell lies out of fancy."
Ornaments of Gold,43,21,Have We given them before this any Book which they stick to as an authority?
Ornaments of Gold,43,22,"(No,) but they say: ‘Indeed, we found our fathers following a course (and a religion), and surely we are rightly guided (following) in their footsteps.’"
Ornaments of Gold,43,23,"And the same way, We never sent any Warner to a town before you, but their chiefs and the affluent people amongst them said: ‘Surely, we found our fathers following a course and a religion, and certainly we are following in their footsteps.’"
Ornaments of Gold,43,24,(The Messenger) said: ‘Even though I bring you a way (and Din [Religion]) better than that on which you found your fathers?’ They said: ‘We deny whatever you have been sent with.’
Ornaments of Gold,43,25,So We took revenge on them. So see what was the end of those who denied!
Ornaments of Gold,43,26,"And when Ibrahim (Abraham) said to his father (i.e., his uncle but called him father as he brought him up) and his people: ‘Surely, I despise all these things that you worship,"
Ornaments of Gold,43,27,Except for Him Who has created me. So He alone will show me the path very soon.’
Ornaments of Gold,43,28,And Ibrahim (Abraham) made that (formula of the Oneness of Allah) the lasting word amongst his descendants and race so that they may remain bent (towards Allah).
Ornaments of Gold,43,29,"In truth, I bestowed upon these people and their ancestors (worldly) provision (for the sake of and due to the mediation of Ibrahim [Abraham]) until there came to them the truth (the Qur’an) and the Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) with clear and illumining exposition."
Ornaments of Gold,43,30,"And when the truth reached them, they said: ‘This is magic and we deny it.’"
Ornaments of Gold,43,31,"And they said: ‘Why has this Qur’an not been sent down upon some high-ranking personage (i.e., some chief, landlord, or the affluent) of the two towns (Mecca and Ta’if)?’"
Ornaments of Gold,43,32,"Is it they who distribute the mercy (of the Prophethood) of your Lord? We distribute amongst them (the resources of) economy in the life of this world, and We alone raise some of them in grades (of wealth and resources) over the others. (Do We do this so that) some of them (who are rich) should make fun of the others (who are poor? This is mockery of poverty if, due to this, you do not consider someone as deserving the mercy of the Prophethood.) And the mercy of your Lord is better than that (wealth) which they amass (and become arrogant)."
Ornaments of Gold,43,33,"And had it not been that mankind (converging on disbelief) would have become one community, We would have made, for those who disbelieve in the Most Kind (Lord), silver roofs for their houses and silver staircases by which they ascend,"
Ornaments of Gold,43,34,"And likewise, (silver) doors of their houses and the couches (too) on which they recline,"

Ornaments of Gold,43,36,"And whoever turns away from the remembrance of the Most Kind (Lord), We appoint a Satan to dominate him and stick to him constantly."

Ornaments of Gold,43,44,"And verily, this (Qur’an) is a great honour for you and for your Umma (Community). And, (O people,) you will soon be asked (how strong and firm a relation you established with the Qur’an)."
Ornaments of Gold,43,45,And ask the Messengers We sent before you whether We made any gods to be worshipped instead of the Most Kind (Lord).
Ornaments of Gold,43,46,"And certainly, We sent Musa (Moses) with Our signs to Pharaoh and his chiefs. He said: ‘Indeed, I am the Messenger of the Lord of all the worlds.’"
Ornaments of Gold,43,47,"So when he came to them with Our signs, there they began laughing at them (the signs)."
Ornaments of Gold,43,48,And never did We show them any sign but (that) it used to be far greater than the resembling sign preceding it. And (eventually) We seized them (many a time) with the torment so that they might desist (from the evil course they followed).
Ornaments of Gold,43,49,"And they said: ‘O magician, pray to your Lord for us according to the promise He has made to you. (Then) surely we shall be guided.’"
Ornaments of Gold,43,50,"But when (granting the prayer of Musa [Moses]) We removed from them that torment, they at once violated the promise."
Ornaments of Gold,43,51,"And Pharaoh (arrogantly) proclaimed amongst his people, saying: ‘O my people, is the kingdom of Egypt not under my control, and (are) these streams (not mine) which are flowing beneath my (palaces)? So do you not see?"
Ornaments of Gold,43,52,"(Is it not the fact that) I am better than this worthless, lowly man who cannot even talk clearly?"
Ornaments of Gold,43,53,"Then (if he is a truthful Messenger,) why are the bracelets of gold not sent upon him, or why do the angels not come with him in ranks (in succession)?’"
Ornaments of Gold,43,54,"So he made fools of his people (by these utterances) and they followed him. They were, indeed, a disobedient people."
Ornaments of Gold,43,55,"But when they spurred Our wrath (by denigrating the dignity of Musa [Moses]), We took revenge on them and drowned them all."
Ornaments of Gold,43,56,So We made them a tale and a lesson of warning for the communities to succeed.
Ornaments of Gold,43,57,"And when the example of (‘Isa [Jesus]) the son of Maryam (Mary) is given, your people laugh (mockingly),"
Ornaments of Gold,43,58,"And say: ‘Are our gods better or he (‘Isa [Jesus])?’ They say this only to have a dispute with you. No doubt, they are very quarrelsome."
Ornaments of Gold,43,59,He (‘Isa [Jesus]) was only an (exalted) servant whom We blessed with favour. And We made him an example (of Our might) for the Children of Israel.
Ornaments of Gold,43,60,"And had We so willed, We would have made angels who would have been your successors to replace you in the earth."
Ornaments of Gold,43,61,"And surely (when) he, (Isa [Jesus], descends from heaven), he will be a sign of (the nearness of) the Last Hour. So do not doubt it at all. And keep following Me. This is the straight path."
Ornaments of Gold,43,62,And let not Satan hinder you (from this way) at all. No doubt he is your open enemy.
Ornaments of Gold,43,63,"And when ‘Isa (Jesus) came with evident signs, he said: ‘Surely, I have come to you with wisdom and understanding, and (with the purpose) that I may make clear to you some of the matters on which you disagree. So fear Allah and obey me."
Ornaments of Gold,43,64,"Surely, Allah is the One Who is your Lord and my Lord (as well). So worship Him alone. That is the only straight path.’"
Ornaments of Gold,43,65,"Then various sects cropped up amongst them. So those who did wrong, woe to them on account of the torment of a grievous Day!"
Ornaments of Gold,43,66,What are they waiting for (save) the Hour that should seize them all of a sudden whilst they have no awareness of it?
Ornaments of Gold,43,67,"On that Day, all friends and acquaintances will become enemies to one another except the pious. (Only their friendship and nearness [wilaya] will prove fruitful.)"
Ornaments of Gold,43,68,"(It will be said to them:) ‘O My (intimate) servants, there is no fear for you this Day, nor shall you grieve.’"
Ornaments of Gold,43,69,(It is) they who believed in Our Revelations and were always obedient (to Us).
Ornaments of Gold,43,70,"Enter Paradise, you and your intimate companions* (all); you will be honoured (with blessings, comforts and the pleasures of Paradise)."
Ornaments of Gold,43,71,"The plates and drinking cups made of gold will be passed around amongst them, and all those things which the hearts will long for, and (that which) will cool the eyes will be available there. And you will dwell there forever."
Ornaments of Gold,43,72,"And, (O Godfearing folk,) this is the Paradise of which you have been made the owners, a recompense of those (works) which you used to do."
Ornaments of Gold,43,73,There are abundant fruits in it for you to eat.
Ornaments of Gold,43,74,"Indeed, the sinners will live forever in the torment of Hell,"
Ornaments of Gold,43,75,"Which will never be decreased for them, and they will be lying there in endless despair."
Ornaments of Gold,43,76,"And We have not wronged them, but they were themselves the wrongdoers."
Ornaments of Gold,43,77,"And they will cry out (to the guard of Hell): ‘O master, (better it is if) your Lord causes us to die.’ He will say: ‘(Now) you will live (in the same plight) forever.’"
Ornaments of Gold,43,78,"Surely, We brought you the truth, but most of you disliked the truth."
Ornaments of Gold,43,79,Have they (the disbelievers of Mecca) finalized (any scheme against the Messenger [blessings and peace be upon him])? So We (too) are going to take the ultimate decision.
Ornaments of Gold,43,80,"Do they think that We do not hear their secret talk and whisperings? Why not? (We do listen.) And the angels sent by Us also remain with them, writing."
Ornaments of Gold,43,81,"Say: ‘If (supposing the impossible) the Most Kind (Lord) had a son (or children), I would have been the first one to worship (him).’"
Ornaments of Gold,43,82,"The Lord of the heavens and the earth, the Lord of the Throne, Glory be to Him, Transcendent above all what they ascribe (to Him)."
Ornaments of Gold,43,83,So leave them. Let them remain indulged in vain talk and absurd sport until they meet the Day which they are promised.
Ornaments of Gold,43,84,"And He is the One Who is God in the heaven and God in the earth (as well) and He is Most Wise, All-Knowing."
Ornaments of Gold,43,85,"And Most Blessed is He to Whom belongs the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth and (also of all) that is between them. And He has the knowledge of the Last Hour (as well), and you will be returned to Him alone."
Ornaments of Gold,43,86,"And those whom they (the disbelievers) worship instead of Allah have no power to intercede. But, (on the contrary, they do have the power of intercession) who bear witness to the truth, and they also know it (with certitude)."
Ornaments of Gold,43,87,And if you ask them: ‘Who has created them?’ they will certainly say: ‘Allah.’ Then where are they wandering disorientated?
Ornaments of Gold,43,88,"And by his (Esteemed Messenger’s) saying: ‘O Lord, surely, they are a people who (somehow) do not tend to believe.’"
Ornaments of Gold,43,89,"So, (O My Beloved,) turn your face away from them and say (like this: ‘Alright, our greeting is:) Peace!’ Then soon they will come to know (their end)."

Smoke,44,10,"So wait for the Day when the sky will cause a clear smoke to appear,"
Smoke,44,11,"Which will envelop people (i.e., will encompass everything). That will be a painful torment."
Smoke,44,12,"(They will then say:) ‘O our Lord! Remove this torment from us. Surely, we believe.’"
Smoke,44,13,"How can their acceptance of the admonition now be (of any use), whereas there came to them a Messenger with a clear exposition?"
Smoke,44,14,But they turned their faces from him and (denigrating) they said: ‘(He) is a tutored madman.’
Smoke,44,15,"Indeed, We remove the torment a little (but) you will certainly reiterate (the same disbelief)."
Smoke,44,16,"The Day when We will seize with the Greatest Seizure, (that Day) We shall certainly exact revenge."

Smoke,44,24,"And (after you pass through) leave the river still and split open. Surely, they are an army who will be drowned.’"
Smoke,44,25,How many a garden and spring they left behind!
Smoke,44,26,And green crops and magnificent buildings!
Smoke,44,27,And blessings (and comforts) in which they used to luxuriate!
Smoke,44,28,So it happened! We made another people the inheritors of all that.
Smoke,44,29,"Then neither the heaven nor the earth wept over them, nor were they given respite."
Smoke,44,30,"And verily, We delivered the Children of Israel from a humiliating suffering,"
Smoke,44,31,"From Pharaoh. Indeed, he was of the most rebellious transgressors."
Smoke,44,32,"And surely, We chose them (the Children of Israel) above (their contemporary civilizations of) the world on the basis of knowledge."
Smoke,44,33,And We bestowed upon them signs containing an obvious favour (and a clear trial).
Smoke,44,34,"Surely, they say:"
Smoke,44,35,‘There is nothing after our first death and we shall not be raised up (again).
Smoke,44,36,So bring back our ancestors (alive) if you are truthful.’
Smoke,44,37,"Well, are they better or the people of Tubba‘ (the people of As‘ad Abu Kurib al-Himyari, the King of Yemen) and those who were before them? We destroyed (all of) them. Surely, they were people given to evildoing."
Smoke,44,38,And We have not created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them merely in sport.
Smoke,44,39,We have created them both with (the purpose and reason) of truth. But most of them do not know.
Smoke,44,40,"Surely, the Day of Judgment is the appointed time for all of them;"
Smoke,44,41,"The Day when a friend shall not avail a friend at all, nor will they be helped,"
Smoke,44,42,"Except those to whom Allah has shown mercy. (They will intercede for one another.) Surely, He is Almighty, Ever-Merciful."
Smoke,44,43,"Indeed, the tree bearing thorny fruit,"
Smoke,44,44,Will be the food of the major sinners.
Smoke,44,45,"It will boil in the bellies like molten copper,"
Smoke,44,46,Like the seething of simmering water.
Smoke,44,47,"(It will be commanded:) ‘Seize him and drag him forcefully to the midst of Hell,"
Smoke,44,48,Then torment him by pouring boiling water over his head.
Smoke,44,49,"Taste it! Yes, you it is, the respectable and venerable (in your notion and claim)."
Smoke,44,50,"Certainly, this is the very Hell you used to doubt.’"
Smoke,44,51,"Assuredly, the Godfearing will be in a place of calm and peace,"

Smoke,44,53,"Dressed in fine silk and heavy brocade, facing one another."
Smoke,44,54,So will it happen! And We shall marry them to fair maidens having lovely wide eyes.
Smoke,44,55,"(Sitting) there, they will call calmly for every kind of fruit."
Smoke,44,56,There (in Paradise) they will not taste death except the first death (which would have passed). And Allah will save them from the torment of Hell.
Smoke,44,57,"It is a bounty of your Lord (i.e., your Lord will bestow through your mediation alone). That is but a great success."
Smoke,44,58,So We have made this (Qur’an) easy in your own tongue so that they may take advice.
Smoke,44,59,"So wait. Certainly, they (too) are waiting. (You will see Our revenge and their evil end, and they will see your glory and My favours to the believers through your mediation.)"
Crouching,45,1,Ha-Mim. (Only Allah and the Messenger [blessings and peace be upon him] know the real meaning.)
Crouching,45,2,"The revelation of (this) Book is from Allah, Almighty, Most Wise."
Crouching,45,3,"Indeed, there are signs for the believers in the heavens and the earth."
Crouching,45,4,"And in your (own) creation, and in the animals which He scatters, there are signs for those who believe with certitude."
Crouching,45,5,"And in the alternation of night and day, and in that provision (of rain) which Allah sends down from the sky, and by that gives life to the earth after its death, and (in the same way) in the changing of the wind direction, there are signs for those who apply reason."
Crouching,45,6,These are the Revelations of Allah which We recite to you with absolute truth. Then what will they believe in after Allah and His Revelations?
Crouching,45,7,"Woe to every liar given to fabricating false allegations (and) every dreadful evildoer,"
Crouching,45,8,"The one who listens to the Revelations of Allah that are recited to him, then insists (on his disbelief) arrogantly as if he did not hear them, give him the news of a grievous torment!"
Crouching,45,9,"And when he learns about any thing of Our Verses (of the Qur’an), he makes it a joke. It is they for whom there is humiliating torment."
Crouching,45,10,"Beyond (their current term of life), there is Hell. And (the worldly riches) which they have earned will be of no use to them. Nor will those idols be (of any benefit) that they have made guardians instead of Allah. And there is a very severe torment for them."
Crouching,45,11,This (Qur’an) is guidance. And for those who disbelieved in the Revelations of Allah is an extremely grievous torment in store.
Crouching,45,12,"Allah is the One Who has placed the sea under your control so that ships and vessels may sail in it by His command, so that you may look for His bounty (i.e., sustenance through the sea routes as well), and that you may become grateful (to Him)."
Crouching,45,13,"And He has made subservient to you, out of His will, whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth, all of it (under a system). Surely, there are signs in it for those who ponder."
Crouching,45,14,"Say to the believers to disregard those who neither hope for nor fear (the coming of) the Days of Allah, so that He may give them full reward of those (deeds) which they used to earn."
Crouching,45,15,"Whoever does a righteous work does it for (the benefit of) his own soul, and whoever commits some evil act, then he alone is to face (suffering caused by it). Then all of you will be returned to your Lord."
Crouching,45,16,"And surely, We gave to the Children of Israel the Book, the reign and Prophethood, and provided them with sustenance of pure things. And We exalted them above (their contemporary) worlds (i.e., the nations and civilizations of that age)."
Crouching,45,17,"And We gave them clear proofs of religion (and Prophethood). But they disagreed (about it) after the knowledge (of raising the Prophet Muhammad [blessings and peace be upon him]) had come to them, merely because of their mutual jealousy, spite and antagonism. Surely, your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Rising concerning the matter in which they used to disagree."
Crouching,45,18,"Then We set you on the open path of Shariah (Islamic law). So follow it persistently. And do not yield to the desires of those who are simply unaware (of the glory, dignity and trueness of your Din [Religion])."
Crouching,45,19,"Surely, these people will not be of any help to you at all (despite promises) from Allah (for crucial time of hardships coming in the way of Islam). And in truth, the wrongdoers (in the world) are friends and helpers only to one another and Allah is the Friend and Helper of the Godfearing."
Crouching,45,20,"This (Qur’an) contains proofs, which provide vision and lessons of warning to the people, and is guidance and mercy for those who believe with certitude."
Crouching,45,21,"Do those who have earned evil deeds think that We shall make them resemble those who believe and do good deeds (so as) to make their life and death alike? The claim, which they (the disbelievers) make, is the worst evil."
Crouching,45,22,"And Allah created the heavens and the earth with (a strategy based on) truth, in order that every soul is rewarded for the deeds that it earns and they will not be wronged."
Crouching,45,23,Have you seen him who has made his desire his god and Allah has held him astray despite his knowledge and has sealed his ears and his heart and has blindfolded his eyes? Then who can guide him after Allah? So do you not accept advice?
Crouching,45,24,"And they say: ‘There is nothing (else) except our worldly life. We die and live here (only). And nothing kills us except (circumstances and occurrences of) time (i.e., they deny Allah and the Hereafter absolutely). And they simply do not have any knowledge of this (reality). They follow only their speculation and assumption."
Crouching,45,25,"And when Our clear Verses are recited to them, they do not have any plea except to say: ‘Bring back our fathers (raised alive) if you are truthful.’"
Crouching,45,26,"Say: ‘Allah is the One Who gives you life, and He is the One Who causes you to die. Then He will gather all of you towards the Day of Resurrection about which there is no doubt. But most people do not know.’"
Crouching,45,27,"And the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth belongs to Allah alone. And the Day when the Last Hour comes, then (all) the disbelievers will run into serious loss."
Crouching,45,28,"And you will see every party (of the disbelievers and beliers) sitting, fallen on their knees. Every community will be called to its book (of deeds): ‘You will be rewarded Today for the deeds that you used to do."
Crouching,45,29,"This is Our record that will speak about you with absolute truth. Verily, We used to (preserve) by getting transcribed what you used to do.’"
Crouching,45,30,"So those who believe and do good deeds, their Lord will admit them to His mercy. That is nothing but an evident success."
Crouching,45,31,And those who disbelieved (it will be said to them:) ‘Were My Verses not recited to you? But you showed arrogance and you were the evildoers.’
Crouching,45,32,"And when it was said: ‘The promise of Allah is true, and there is no doubt about (the coming of) the Last Hour,’ you used to say: ‘We do not know what the Last Hour is; we regard it nothing but a conjecture; nor do we have any faith in it.’"
Crouching,45,33,"And all their evil works which they used to do will be exposed, and that (torment) which they used to make fun of will beset them."
Crouching,45,34,And it will be said (to them): ‘Today We forget you as you forgot your Meeting on this Day. And Hell is your abode and there will be no helper for you.
Crouching,45,35,"That (is) so because you made fun of Allah’s Revelations, and the worldly life deceived you.’ So Today neither will they be taken out of that (Hell), nor will there be accepted from them any attempt to seek (Allah’s) pleasure by means of repentance."
Crouching,45,36,"So all praise belongs to Allah alone, Who is the Lord of the heavens and the Master of the earth (and also) the Sustainer of all the worlds."
Crouching,45,37,"And all Greatness (i.e., Eminence) in the heavens and the earth belongs to Him alone, and He is the One Who is Almighty, Most Wise."
The Wind-Curved Sandhills,46,1,Ha-Mim. (Only Allah and the Messenger [blessings and peace be upon him] know the real meaning.)
The Wind-Curved Sandhills,46,2,"The revelation of this Book is from Allah, Almighty, Most Wise."
The Wind-Curved Sandhills,46,3,We have not created the heavens and the earth and (the creation) that is between them but with wisdom and (the fixing of) an appointed term. And those who have disbelieved turn away from what they have been warned of.
The Wind-Curved Sandhills,46,4,"Say: ‘Tell me of the (idols) you worship instead of Allah; show me what they have created in the earth, or (bring it forth if) they have a partnership in (the creation of) the heavens. Bring me (as a proof) any Book (revealed) before this (Qur’an), or some remnant of knowledge (transmitted from the bygone people), if you are truthful.’"
The Wind-Curved Sandhills,46,5,And who can be more in error than someone who worships such (idols) apart from Allah as cannot answer (his question) till the Day of Resurrection? And those (idols) have no consciousness of their prayer and worship.
The Wind-Curved Sandhills,46,6,"And when mankind shall be gathered (on the Day of Resurrection), those (false gods) will be their enemies and will deny their worship (for their own absolution)."
The Wind-Curved Sandhills,46,7,"And when Our clear Verses are recited to them, (then) the disbelievers say about the truth (the Qur’an) whilst it has come to them: ‘This is obvious magic.’"
The Wind-Curved Sandhills,46,8,"Do they say that (the Messenger) has fabricated it (the Qur’an)? Say: ‘If I have concocted it, then you have no authority to save me from (the torment of) Allah. And He knows best the (words) you utter about this (Qur’an) as mockery. He (Allah) is Sufficient as witness between me and you. And He is Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful.’"
The Wind-Curved Sandhills,46,9,"Say: ‘I am not the first Messenger (sent to mankind that no precedent of Messengership exists before me). Nor do I know of my own accord (i.e., purely by means of my own mental faculty and self-application) what will be done to me or what will be done to you. (My knowledge is nothing except that) I follow that revelation alone which is sent to me. (It is this that provides me knowledge about everything.) And I am simply a clear Warner (on the basis of this knowledge obtained through revelation)."
The Wind-Curved Sandhills,46,10,"Say: ‘Tell me, if this (Qur’an) is from Allah and you deny it and a witness from the Children of Israel (also) bears testimony to the mention of (the revelation of) such a Book (in the Revealed Books revealed earlier), then he believes (in it as well), but (despite that) you show arrogance (then what will be your fate?) Surely, Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.’"
The Wind-Curved Sandhills,46,11,"And the disbelievers said to the believers: ‘Had it (the Din of Muhammad [blessings and peace be upon him]) been a better (religion), these people would not have advanced towards it taking the lead over us. (We would have accepted it before anyone else.)’ And when they (the disbelievers) have not taken guidance from it (themselves), now they say: ‘This is an old lie (and a fabrication).’"
The Wind-Curved Sandhills,46,12,"And before it was the Book of Musa (Moses [the Torah]), a guide and mercy. And this Book confirms that. It is in the Arabic language to warn the wrongdoers and give good news to the pious."
The Wind-Curved Sandhills,46,13,"Surely, those who say: ‘Allah is our Lord,’ then hold fast (to it) have nothing to fear, nor shall they grieve."
The Wind-Curved Sandhills,46,14,"They it is, the people of Paradise, who will live in it forever. This is the reward of the deeds they used to do."
The Wind-Curved Sandhills,46,15,"And We have commanded man to be benevolent towards his parents. His mother bears him (in the womb) with pain and gives birth to him with pain. And bearing him (in the womb) and weaning of him (i.e., the period of pregnancy and feeding) is (spread over) thirty months. Till, when he attains to manhood and then reaches (the age of) forty years, he says: ‘O my Lord, bestow on me the ability to give You thanks for the favour which You have done to me and my parents, and that I may do such deeds as may please You, and endow me and my children with virtue and piety. Assuredly I turn to You, and certainly I am of those who obey You in submissiveness.’"
The Wind-Curved Sandhills,46,16,It is they whose good works We accept and overlook their omissions. (It is) they (who) are the people of Paradise. This is the true promise which is being made to them.
The Wind-Curved Sandhills,46,17,"And he who says to his parents: ‘Fie on you! Do you promise me that I shall be brought forth (from the grave and given life once more) when generations have passed away before me?’ Now both (the parents) pray to Allah for help (and say to the son:) ‘Woe to you, (O son!) Accept faith. Surely, Allah’s promise is true.’ But he says (in reply): ‘These (words) are nothing but the fiction of the bygone people.’"
The Wind-Curved Sandhills,46,18,"It is they against whom the command of Allah’s (torment) has proved true amongst generations that have passed of the jinn as well as mankind. Surely, they (all) were the losers."
The Wind-Curved Sandhills,46,19,"And the ranks (in Paradise and Hell) are allocated for all (separately) according to the (good and evil) deeds which they do, so that (Allah) pays them back in full for their actions and they will not be wronged at all."
The Wind-Curved Sandhills,46,20,"And the Day when the disbelievers will be brought before the Fire of Hell (it will be said to them:) ‘You received your favourite and tasteful luxuries in the life of the world and exacted from them (maximum) benefit. So, Today you will be rewarded the punishment of humiliation because you lived on earth with arrogance unjustly and (also) because you used to disobey.’"
The Wind-Curved Sandhills,46,21,"And, (O Beloved,) remember (Hud) the kinship brother of the people of ‘Ad, when he warned his people (of the dire consequences of their evil deeds) in al-Ahqaf, (the Sand-Dunes [a valley in Yemen, between Oman and Mahra]) although (a number of) Warners (i.e., Messengers) had passed before and after him, (saying:) ‘Worship no one but Allah. I fear for you the punishment of a (Terrible) Day.’"
The Wind-Curved Sandhills,46,22,They said: ‘Have you come to us to turn us away from our gods? So bring us that (torment) you are threatening us with if you are of those who speak the truth.’
The Wind-Curved Sandhills,46,23,He said: ‘The knowledge (of the Hour of the torment) is with Allah alone. And I am only transmitting to you the injunctions which I have been sent with. But I can see that you are an ignorant people.’
The Wind-Curved Sandhills,46,24,"So when they saw that (torment) advancing on their valleys like a cloud, they said: ‘This is the cloud that is going to rain upon us.’ (Nay, not that,) rather this (cloud) is that (torment) which you were restlessly seeking to hasten. (This) is the storm in which is (approaching) a grievous punishment."
The Wind-Curved Sandhills,46,25,(That) will destroy everything by the command of its Lord. They were (destroyed) in such a way that nothing could be seen except their (ruined) houses. That is how We punish the evildoers.
The Wind-Curved Sandhills,46,26,"(O people of Mecca!) In fact, We had given them power and ability in those fields of activity in which We have not granted you potential. And We blessed them with hearing and sight and (invaluable qualities of) head and heart. But neither their ears nor their eyes, nor their heads and hearts were of any use to them since they kept denying the signs of Allah. And (at last) that (torment) which they used to laugh at besieged them."
The Wind-Curved Sandhills,46,27,"And, (O people of Mecca,) indeed We destroyed many a town around you, and displayed Our signs time and again so that they might turn (back to them from disbelief)."
The Wind-Curved Sandhills,46,28,"Then why did those (idols) not come to their aid, which they had taken as gods besides Allah for attaining (His) nearness? But in fact, they (false gods) were lost from them. And this (setting up false gods) was their lie. And (it was) this fabrication that they used to weave."
The Wind-Curved Sandhills,46,29,"And, when, (O Beloved,) We diverted a group of jinn to you, listening to the Qur’an with active attention, (and) when they came there (i.e., before the holy presence of the Messenger [blessings and peace be upon him]), they said (to one another): ‘Keep silent.’ And when (the recitation) was over, they went back as warners to their people (i.e., the callers to the truth)."
The Wind-Curved Sandhills,46,30,"They said: ‘O our people (O community of jinn), indeed we have heard such a Book that has been revealed after (the Torah of) Musa (Moses. It) confirms (the Books) that came before it, and guides to the true (Din [Religion]) and the straight road."
The Wind-Curved Sandhills,46,31,O our people! Accept the call of the Caller (the Holy Prophet Muhammad [blessings and peace be upon him]) to Allah and believe in him. Allah will then forgive your sins and save you from a painful punishment.
The Wind-Curved Sandhills,46,32,And he who does not accept the call of the Caller (the Holy Prophet Muhammad [blessings and peace be upon him]) to Allah cannot thwart Allah (by running away) on earth. Nor will there be any helpers for him except Allah. It is they who are in open error.’
The Wind-Curved Sandhills,46,33,"Do they not know that Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth and was not tired by creating them, has (also) the power to bring the dead back to life (again)? Yes, of course, He has power over everything."
The Wind-Curved Sandhills,46,34,"And the Day when the disbelievers will be brought to the Fire (it will be said to them:) ‘Is this (punishment) not based on the truth?’ They will say: ‘Yes, of course! By our Lord (it is true).’ (Allah) will say: ‘Then taste the punishment you used to deny.’"
The Wind-Curved Sandhills,46,35,"(O Beloved!) So be steadfast as (other) Messengers were with unwavering determination, and do not hasten (to seek the torment) for these (deniers). The Day they will see this (punishment in the Hereafter) which they are being promised, (they will think) as though they did not stay (in the world) for more than an hour. (This is but) the communication of the Message (from Allah). Those other than the disobedient will not be destroyed."
Muhammad,47,1,"Those who disbelieve and hinder (others) from the way of Allah, Allah destroys their actions (as for their reward in the Hereafter)."
Muhammad,47,2,"And those who embrace faith and do pious works persistently and believe in this (Book) which has been revealed to Muhammad (blessings and peace be upon him), and that is the very truth from their Lord, Allah erases their evil works from their (record of deeds) and refines their states of being."
Muhammad,47,3,"That is because those who disbelieve follow falsehood, and those who believe follow the truth (sent down) from their Lord. That is how Allah illustrates for people their states of being."
Muhammad,47,4,"So when you are to fight (for the elimination of militancy and terrorism) against the (warring) disbelievers (in the battlefield), strike their necks (whilst fighting because they slaughtered harmless human lives and destroyed peace by their terrorist activities) till, when you have killed a good many of them (in the battle), then tie (the remaining prisoners) tightly. Thereafter, either set (them) free (without ransom) as a favour or (free them) for ransom (i.e., cost of freedom) till the warring (hostile army) lays down its weapons (i.e., announces the truce). That is (the command). And if Allah had willed, He would have avenged Himself on them (without war). But (He did not do so) in order to try some of you by means of others. And as for those who are slain in the way of Allah, He will not at all make their actions fruitless."
Muhammad,47,5,"He will soon put them on the straight path (of Paradise), and will greatly enhance their states of being (in the Hereafter)."
Muhammad,47,6,And He will (ultimately) admit them to Paradise which He has (already) made well known to them.
Muhammad,47,7,"O believers! If you help (the Din [Religion] of) Allah, He will help you and will make your feet firm."
Muhammad,47,8,"And those who disbelieve, for them is destruction and (Allah) has ruined their actions."
Muhammad,47,9,That is because they hate that (Book) which Allah has sent down so He has made their actions come to nothing.
Muhammad,47,10,Have they not travelled and toured in the earth so that they could see the fate of those who passed before them? Allah cast upon them total destruction. There are many such calamities awaiting the disbelievers.
Muhammad,47,11,"That is because Allah is the Protector and Helper of those who believe, and for sure the disbelievers do not have any protector and helper."
Muhammad,47,12,"Surely, those who believe and do pious works, Allah will admit them to Gardens with streams flowing under them, and those who disbelieve and are enjoying (worldly) gains and eat as cattle (animals) do, so Hell alone will be their abode."
Muhammad,47,13,"And, (O Beloved,) how many a town have We destroyed whose citizens wielded greater power (i.e., resources and authority) than (the residents of) your city (Mecca) whose (powerful chiefs) have driven you out (by emigration)! We have destroyed them as well, and no one came to their help (who could save them)."
Muhammad,47,14,Is someone who is (firm) on the clear proof from his Lord like those whose evil actions are shown to them as fair and who follow the desires of their (ill-commanding) selves?
Muhammad,47,15,"A feature of the Paradise which is promised to the Godfearing is that therein are streams of (such) water as will never putrefy (in smell or colour), and (in it) will be streams of milk whose taste and flavour will never change, and streams of (such a pure) wine that is an absolute delight for all who drink it and streams of purified honey; and (in it) will be fruits of every kind (for them) and forgiveness (of every sort) from their Lord. Can this (pious man) be like those who are permanent residents of Hell and who will be given scalding water to drink which will cut their gut into pieces?"
Muhammad,47,16,"And amongst them are those who give ears to you (without their heads and hearts in it) till, when they leave your presence and go (out), they ask those who have been given (profitable) knowledge: ‘What is it that he (the Messenger [blessings and peace be upon him]) said just now?’ It is they whose hearts Allah has sealed up and they are following their lusts."
Muhammad,47,17,"And as for those who have taken guidance, Allah increases their guidance and honours them with their station of Godwariness."
Muhammad,47,18,So are they (the deniers) now just waiting for the Last Hour to come upon them all of a sudden? Its signs have no doubt drawn (near). But what (good) will their admonition do to them when the Last Hour (itself) approaches?
Muhammad,47,19,"Know then that there is no God except Allah and (to offer worship and to educate the Umma [Community]) always ask forgiveness (from Allah) lest an action unworthy of your incomparable station may come into occurrence.* And also seek forgiveness (i.e., intercede) for the believing men and women (for that is all they may have in balance for forgiveness). And, (O people,) Allah knows (all about) the places where you move about (in the world) and your mansions of repose (in the Hereafter)."
Muhammad,47,20,"And the believers say why a Sura (Chapter) is not revealed (about the command of defensive fighting). But when a clear Sura is revealed and (defensive) fighting for the cause of Allah is (plainly) mentioned in it, you see those who have the disease (of hypocrisy) in their hearts looking at you like someone who is fainting to death. So, for them is disaster."
Muhammad,47,21,"(Best for them would be) obedience and good words. So when the command of fighting (for self-protection and self-defence) was definite (and firm), then if they had been true to Allah (in obedience and dedication), that would have been better for them."
Muhammad,47,22,"So, (O hypocrites,) what is expected of you is that if you (escape fighting by dodging and) attain to power, you will spread only mischief in the land and break your ties of kinship (which Allah and His Messenger [blessings and peace be upon him] have commanded to strengthen with affection and care)."
Muhammad,47,23,It is they whom Allah has cursed and made deaf (their ears) and blinded their eyes.
Muhammad,47,24,"Do they not think over the Qur’an, or are their hearts locked?"
Muhammad,47,25,"Surely, those who turned back (to disbelief) after the guidance had become clear to them, Satan (by fraud) made (turning back to disbelief) look good to them and gave them false hope of living long (in the world)."
Muhammad,47,26,That is because they said to those who dislike the Book revealed by Allah: ‘We shall obey you in certain matters.’ And Allah knows best their secret consultations.
Muhammad,47,27,Then what will be (their plight at the time) when the angels will snatch out their souls (this way) that they will be striking their faces and their backs?
Muhammad,47,28,That is because they followed that (path) which displeases Allah and disliked His good pleasure; so He made (all) their actions null and void.
Muhammad,47,29,Do those who have the disease (of hypocrisy) in their hearts think that Allah will never make known their malice and hostilities?
Muhammad,47,30,"And if We will, We can surely show these (hypocrites) to you (in such a manner) that you may recognize them by their facial expressions and (likewise) you may recognize them by their conversation style and Allah knows (best) all your actions."
Muhammad,47,31,And We shall certainly try you till We bring to light those of you who strive hard and fight (firm-footed) and who observe patience and expose your (secret) news (of hypocritical cowardice) as well.
Muhammad,47,32,"Indeed, those who disbelieved and hindered (the people) from the way of Allah and opposed the Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him), (and chose the path of breaking away from him,) after the guidance (i.e., the gnosis of the veneration of the Holy Messenger [blessings and peace be upon him]) had become clear to them, they would not be able to harm Allah anyway (i.e., would not be able to decrease the incomparable superiority and pre-eminence of the Messenger* [blessings and peace be upon him]). Allah will wreck (all) their works (due to their opposition to the Holy Messenger [blessings and peace be upon him])."
Muhammad,47,33,O believers! Obey Allah and obey the Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) and do not ruin your works.
Muhammad,47,34,"Indeed, those who disbelieved and hindered (the people) from the way of Allah and then died as disbelievers, Allah will never forgive them."
Muhammad,47,35,"(O believers!) Do not lose heart and do not ask (the warring disbelievers) for peace (lest it should suggest your weakness). And it is you who will have the upper hand. And Allah is with you, and He will never reduce (the reward of) your actions."
Muhammad,47,36,"Doubtlessly, the life of the world is nothing but merely a sport and pastime. And if you believe and adopt Godwariness, He will pay you the recompense (of your deeds in full), and will not require of you your wealth."
Muhammad,47,37,"If He asks you for this wealth and puts you under scarcity for that, then you will feel constrained (at heart and) become miserly. And in this way, He will expose your (inner) rust (which results from worldly pursuits)."
Muhammad,47,38,"Remember! You are those who are called to spend in the way of Allah. Then there are some of you who act miserly. And whoever acts miserly does it only against himself. And Allah is Independent and you (all) are dependent. And if you turn away from the command of Allah, He will replace you with another people who will not be like you."
Victory,48,1,"(O Esteemed Beloved!) Surely, We decreed for you a clear victory (and the dominance of Islam so that your great struggle might be completed with success),"
Victory,48,2,"So that Allah forgives, for your sake, all the earlier and later sins (of all those people) of your Umma ([Community]* who struggled, fought and sacrificed by your command), and (this way) may complete His blessing on you (outwardly and inwardly) in the form of Islam’s victory and forgiveness for your Umma (Community), and may keep (your Umma) firm-footed on the straight path (through your mediation),"
Victory,48,3,And so that Allah grants you most honourable help and support.
Victory,48,4,"He is the One Who sent down calmness and tranquillity into the hearts of the believers so that their faith gets increased with more faith (and the faith learnt—‘the knowledge of certitude’ changes into the faith seen—‘the eye of certitude’). And all the armies of the heavens and the earth belong to Allah alone. And Allah is All-Knowing, Most Wise."
Victory,48,5,(All these favours are put together) so that He admits the believing men and women to the Gardens with streams flowing under them. They will live in them forever. And (moreover) He removes from them their evil actions (as He has forgiven them their mistakes)—and this is a great success (of the believers) in the sight of Allah—
Victory,48,6,"And (so that) He may punish the hypocritical men and women and the polytheistic men and women who entertain evil assumptions about Allah. For them is (predestined) an evil turn of fortune. And Allah has afflicted them with His wrath, has cursed them and has prepared for them Hell. And that is a very evil resting place."
Victory,48,7,"And all armies of the heavens and the earth belong to Allah alone. And Allah is Almighty, Most Wise."
Victory,48,8,"Indeed, We have sent you as an eyewitness (of the actions and the state of affairs of Umma [Community] to bear testimony on the Day of Reckoning) and as a Bearer of good news and as a Warner,"
Victory,48,9,"So that, (O people,) you may believe in Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) and may help his (Din [Religion]), and revere and venerate him heart and soul, and (with that) glorify Allah morning and evening."
Victory,48,10,"(O Beloved!) Indeed, those who pledge allegiance to you in fact pledge allegiance to Allah alone. Allah’s hand is over their hands (in the form of your hand). Then whoever breaks his pledge breaks it only to his own harm. But he who fulfils what he has promised to Allah, He will bless him with immense reward."
Victory,48,11,"Soon the Bedouins who lagged behind (from participating in al-Hudaybiya) will say to you (apologetically): ‘Our money matters and families kept us busy. (Therefore, we missed your company.) So ask forgiveness for us from Allah.’ They utter such (words) with their tongues that are not in their hearts. Say: ‘Who has the power to save you against (the decision) of Allah if He intends to do you harm, or if He intends to do you good? But Allah is Well Aware of what you do."
Victory,48,12,"No, in fact, you thought that the Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) and the believers (his Companions) would never return to their families now, and (your ill-commanding selves) made that (thought) seem to your hearts far fascinating. And you imagined a highly evil speculation and became a people bound to perish.’"
Victory,48,13,"And whoever does not believe in Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him), then We have prepared Hell for the disbelievers."
Victory,48,14,"And the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth belongs to Allah alone. He forgives whom He wills and punishes whom He wills. And Allah is Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful."
Victory,48,15,"When you will set out to collect the spoils (of Khaybar), those who remained behind (in the march towards al-Hudaybiya) will say: ‘Allow us also to follow you.’ They seek to alter Allah’s Words. Say: ‘You shall by no means follow us. Allah said the same beforehand.’ So now they will say: ‘In fact, you are jealous of us.’ The truth is that they understand (the truth) but little."
Victory,48,16,"Say to the Bedouins lagging behind: ‘You will be called up soon (to fight) against a hard-hitting, warring people. Then you will fight them on (for the promotion of peace and human dignity), or they will become Muslims. So if you obey the command, Allah will give you an excellent reward. But if you turn away as you did before, He will make you suffer from an agonizing torment.’"
Victory,48,17,"There is no blame on the blind or the lame or the sick (for their disability to fight). And He who obeys Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him), He will admit him to the Gardens with streams flowing under them. But whoever turns away (from obedience), He will punish him with a grievous torment."
Victory,48,18,"Surely, Allah was well pleased with the believers when they pledged allegiance to you under the tree (at al-Hudaybiya). So the (passion of truth and fidelity) that permeated their hearts, Allah had its knowledge and sent down an exceptional calmness and tranquillity (into their hearts, and awarded them the forthcoming victory (of Khaybar),"
Victory,48,19,"And (also) the abundant spoils that they are taking and Allah is Almighty, Most Wise."
Victory,48,20,"And Allah has promised you abundant spoils (resulting from many victories) which you will win, but He has hastened to you this (booty of Khaybar) and has held back from you the hands of the people (of Mecca, Khaybar, Banu Asad and Ghatafan tribes and all other enemies), so that it may become a sign for the believers (of the forthcoming triumph and victory), and that He may keep you treading the straight road (firm-footed and with tranquil hearts)."
Victory,48,21,"And other (big victories of Mecca, Hawazin and Hunayn, then Persia and Rome) over which you had no power—surely Allah has also encompassed them (for you), and Allah wields Absolute Power over everything."
Victory,48,22,"And, (O believers,) if the disbelievers had (initiated war and) fought with you (at al-Hudaybiya), they would certainly have fled turning their backs and found no friend and helper. (But Allah intended to open the door of victories to you through dialogue and negotiations for peace.)"
Victory,48,23,"(This) is Allah’s pattern that has been established through time, and you will never find any change in the Laws of Allah."
Victory,48,24,And He is the One Who held back the hands of those (disbelievers) from you and your hands from them on the frontier of Mecca (near al-Hudaybiya) after giving you the upper hand over their (party). And Allah best monitors what you do.
Victory,48,25,"It is they who disbelieved and hindered you from the Sacred Mosque, and prevented the sacrificial animals as well that were kept from reaching their place. And had there not been many such believing men and women (present in Mecca) as you also did not know that you might crush them underfoot without knowing, and some harm and hardship might also be caused to you by them inadvertently, (We would have allowed you there and then to fight. But the victory of Mecca was delayed) so that Allah might admit to His mercy whom He willed. Had (the disbelievers and the believers there) distinguishably drawn apart from one another, We would have punished the disbelievers with a painful torment."
Victory,48,26,"Whilst the disbelievers anchored in their hearts the conceited obstinacy (which was) stubbornness and egocentricity of the days of ignorance, Allah sent down on His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) and the believers an exceptional calmness and tranquillity and made them firm on the word of Godwariness. And it is this that they were most entitled to and (also) worthy of. And Allah knows everything full well."
Victory,48,27,"Surely, Allah showed His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) the dream exactly true to the reality that, if Allah wills, you will most certainly enter the Sacred Mosque safely, (some) with heads shaved and (some) with hair cut short, (in a state of security,) having no fear. So He knew (the al-Hudaybiya treaty as a preamble to the truth of the dream) which you did not know, and gave you an immediate victory (the victory of Khaybar even before the victory of Mecca, soon after returning from al-Hudaybiya. The next year He bestowed the victory of Mecca and entry to the Sacred Mosque.)"
Victory,48,28,He is the One Who sent His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) with guidance and the Din (Religion) of truth to make it prevail over all other religions. And Allah is Sufficient as a witness (to the truthfulness and veracity of the Messenger [blessings and peace be upon him]).
Victory,48,29,"Muhammad (blessings and peace be upon him) is the Messenger of Allah. And those with him are hard and tough against the disbelievers but kind-hearted and merciful amongst themselves. You see them excessively bowing and prostrating themselves. They simply seek Allah’s grace and pleasure. Their mark is an impression of prostrations on their faces (prominent on the foreheads as light). These traits of theirs are (mentioned) in the Torah and the (same) qualities are also (described) in the Injil (the Gospel). These (Companions) are like a cultivated crop (of Our Esteemed Beloved) which (first of all) brought forth its thin shoot, then made it powerful and strong, and then it thickened and stood straight on its stalk. (And when it flourished, bloomed and danced,) it delighted and charmed the cultivators. (Allah has, likewise, made the Companions of His Beloved strong, grown up trees of faith,) so that by means of them He would inflame the hearts of the disbelievers (that burn in the jealousy of the Holy Prophet Muhammad [blessings and peace be upon him]). Those who believe and do pious works, Allah has promised them forgiveness and an immense reward."
The Private Apartments,49,1,"O believers! Do not step ahead of Allah and His Messenger ([blessings and peace be upon him] in any matter) and keep fearing Allah (lest some discourtesy should occur displeasing the Messenger [blessings and peace be upon him]). Surely, Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing."
The Private Apartments,49,2,"O believers! Do not raise your voices above the voice of the Prophet (blessings and peace be upon him), and (also) do not speak to him so loud as you are loud when you speak to one another (lest) all your actions should come to nothing (including your faith), and you are not even aware (that your faith and all pious works have been wrecked)."
The Private Apartments,49,3,"Assuredly, those who keep their voices low in the presence of Allah’s Messenger (out of profound veneration and submissiveness), it is they whose hearts Allah has chosen for Godwariness and permeated with sincerity. For them alone is forgiveness and an immense reward."
The Private Apartments,49,4,"Verily, those who call out to you from outside your apartments, most of them do not have the understanding (of your exalted station and incomparable status and polite manners of veneration that are due to you)."
The Private Apartments,49,5,"And if they had only been patient till you had come out to them, it would have been better for them. And Allah is Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful."
The Private Apartments,49,6,"O believers! If some wicked person brings you any news, inquire thoroughly into its truth (lest) you should cause (undue) harm to a people unknowingly, and later feel regret for what you have done."
The Private Apartments,49,7,"And remember that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace be upon him) is amongst you. If he accepted what you say in most of the matters, you would be in serious trouble. But Allah has blessed you with the love of faith and has embelished it in your hearts and has made you hate disbelief, disobedience and sins. Such are they that follow the path of Din (Religion) resolutely and steadfastly."
The Private Apartments,49,8,"(It) is due to Allah’s bounty and favour (i.e., the raising of the untaught Messenger and his presence amongst you). And Allah is All-Knowing, Most Wise."
The Private Apartments,49,9,"And if two parties of the Muslims fight, make them reconcile. Then if either of these (parties) commits injustice and aggression against the other, fight against (the party) that is committing aggression till it returns to Allah’s command (of establishing peace). When they revert and submit, make peace between them with equity. And put justice to work. Surely, Allah loves those who do justice."
The Private Apartments,49,10,"The truth is that (all) believers are brothers (to one another). So make peace between your two brothers and always fear Allah, so that you may be shown mercy."
The Private Apartments,49,11,"O believers! Let no community ridicule another community. It is likely that they may be better than those (who ridicule). Nor should women make fun of other women. It is likely that they may be better than those (who make fun). And do not offend or find fault with one another, nor call each other names. Calling someone wicked or indecent after (he embraces) faith is an extremely evil name. And those who do not turn to Allah in repentance, it is they who are the wrongdoers."
The Private Apartments,49,12,"O believers! Avoid most conjectures. Indeed, some conjectures are sins (liable to punishment in the Hereafter). And spy not (on someone’s unknown matters or secrets), nor backbite one another. Would any of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother? You would hate it. And fear Allah (in all such matters). Indeed, Allah is Ever-Returning, Ever-Merciful."
The Private Apartments,49,13,"O people! We created you from a male and a female, and (divided) you into (large) peoples and tribes, so that you might recognize one another. Surely, the most honourable amongst you in the sight of Allah is he who fears Allah the most. Certainly, Allah is All-Knowing, All-Aware."
The Private Apartments,49,14,"The Bedouins say: ‘We have believed.’ Say: ‘You have not believed. Rather say: We have accepted Islam. And the belief has not yet gone into your hearts. If you obey Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him), He will not decrease anything (in reward) for your deeds. Surely, Allah is Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful.’"
The Private Apartments,49,15,"The true believers are only those who have believed in Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) and then never have any doubt, and who fight in the way of Allah with their material as well as human resources. It is they who are true (in their claim to believe)."
The Private Apartments,49,16,Say: ‘Are you trying to show off to Allah your Din (Religion) whilst Allah knows all that is in the heavens and in the earth? And Allah is Well Aware of everything.’
The Private Apartments,49,17,"These people are showing off to you that they have done a favour to you by embracing Islam. Say: ‘Do not show off your Islam as a favour to me. Instead, Allah is the One Who favours you by guiding you to faith, provided you are true (to belief).’"
The Private Apartments,49,18,"Surely, Allah knows all the unseen of the heavens and the earth, and Allah monitors best whatever you do."
Qâf,50,1,"Qaf. (Only Allah and the Messenger [blessings and peace be upon him] know the real meaning.) By the Glorious Qur’an,"
Qâf,50,2,But they wondered that a Warner had come to them from amongst themselves. So the disbelievers say: ‘This is strange!
Qâf,50,3,Is it that when we are dead and have become dust (then we shall become alive again)? This return is far (from understanding and perception).’
Qâf,50,4,"Definitely, We know how much the earth (eats up and) consumes their (bodies), and We have a Book wherein everything is preserved."
Qâf,50,5,"But (strange and far from understanding is this that) they denied the truth (i.e., the Messenger and the Qur’an) when it came to them. So they have themselves stepped into anxiety and confusion."
Qâf,50,6,"Have they not looked at the sky above them how We made it and (how) We adorned it, and there is no crack in it?"
Qâf,50,7,And (in the same way) We spread out the earth and We placed in it heavy mountains and produced in it every kind of beautiful plants.
Qâf,50,8,"All that is (a source of) insight, direction and guidance for every servant who turns (to Allah in repentance)."
Qâf,50,9,"And We showered blessed water from the sky and then produced with it gardens and (also) the grain of harvests,"
Qâf,50,10,And date-palms soaring high with layers of spathes.
Qâf,50,11,"(This all is done as) sustenance for the servants, and We gave life with this (water) to the dead earth. In like manner is (your) coming forth from the graves."
Qâf,50,12,"Before these (disbelievers of Mecca), the people of Nuh (Noah) and the people of the blind well (al-Rass in al-Yamama) and Thamud (the people of Salih, in the town of al-Hijr near Tabuk on the Medina-Syria road),"
Qâf,50,13,"And ‘Ad (the people of Hud in Ahqaf valley of Yemen situated between Oman and the al-Mahra) and Pharaoh (the ruler of Egypt) and the people of Lut [Lot] (living in Sodom and ‘Amura [Gomorrah] in Palestine),"
Qâf,50,14,"And the inhabitants of al-Ayka (the wood in Madyan, the people of Shu‘ayb), and the people of Tubba‘ (the people of As‘ad Abu Kurib al-Himyari, the King of Yemen)—(in sum) all (of them) rejected the Messengers. So My promise of punishment (against them) proved true."
Qâf,50,15,"So are We tired by the first creation? (Nay!) In fact, it is they who are in doubt about the new creation."
Qâf,50,16,"And assuredly, We created man and We know (also) the doubts which his (ill-commanding) self puts (into his heart and mind). And We are nearer to him than his jugular vein."
Qâf,50,17,"When the two receivers receive (the recording angels write down his every communication and work), sitting on the right and on the left,"
Qâf,50,18,Not a word does he utter but a watcher is there beside him ready (to write it).
Qâf,50,19,"And the stupor of death comes with the truth. (O man,) that is what you were running away from!"
Qâf,50,20,And the Trumpet will be blown. It is (this torment) the Day of Warning.
Qâf,50,21,"And every soul will appear (before Our presence), one (angel) forcing it forward and (the other) a witness (to its actions)."
Qâf,50,22,"The truth is that you were negligent of this (Day), so We have removed your veil (of negligence) and Today your sight is sharp."
Qâf,50,23,And his close companion (angel) will say: ‘That is what I have ready (for you).’
Qâf,50,24,"(It will be commanded:) ‘Both of you hurl into Hell every (such) ungrateful rebel,"
Qâf,50,25,"That hinders from good, exceeds the limits, doubts and puts into doubt,"
Qâf,50,26,That had set up another god besides Allah. So hurl him into a fierce torment.’
Qâf,50,27,"(Now) his (other) companion (Satan) will say: ‘O our Lord, I did not misguide him. In fact, he was himself suffering from misguidance of extreme degree.’"
Qâf,50,28,Allah will say: ‘Do not dispute in My presence whilst I have already sent you the warning (of punishment).
Qâf,50,29,The command is never changed in My presence. Nor do I wrong the servants.’
Qâf,50,30,That Day We shall ask Hell: ‘Are you filled up?’ And it will say: ‘Is there any more?’
Qâf,50,31,And Paradise will be brought close to the pious; it will not be distant at all.
Qâf,50,32,"(And it will be said to them:) ‘This is what you were promised; (it is meant) for everyone who turns to Allah in repentance and who guards (his Din [Religion] and faith),"
Qâf,50,33,"Who fears the Most Kind (Lord) unseen, and comes (before the presence of Allah) with a heart turned in repentance."
Qâf,50,34,Enter it in peace; this is the Day of Eternity.’
Qâf,50,35,"All those blessings which they will long for will be there for them in that (Paradise), and there is still another blessing with Us (or much more; so the lovers will be enchanted)."
Qâf,50,36,And how many generations We destroyed before them (the disbelievers and idolaters of Mecca) who were far stronger in power and might than they! So they searched the cities (of the world) to run away somewhere for refuge (from death or torment).
Qâf,50,37,"There is indeed sure warning and admonition in it for him who has a heart (vigilant and awake, far from negligence,) or listens with active attention (i.e., focuses attention having no contact with anyone other than Allah) and is in a state of (spiritual) vision (i.e., remains lost in the effulgent disclosures of Allah’s absolute beauty)."
Qâf,50,38,"And surely, We have created the heavens and the earth and that (universe) which is between the two in six periods and no fatigue has touched Us."
Qâf,50,39,So be patient with what they say and glorify your Lord with praise before sunrise and before sunset.
Qâf,50,40,And also glorify Him during some hours of the night and after the Prayers as well.
Qâf,50,41,"And listen attentively (of the Day) when a caller will call from a near place,"
Qâf,50,42,The Day when people will assuredly hear a mighty roar. That will be the Day of coming out from the graves.
Qâf,50,43,"Surely, it is We Who give life, and it is We Who cause death, and to Us is the return."
Qâf,50,44,"The Day when the earth will split apart from above them, they will come out in haste. This raising them alive (i.e., gathering the people once again) is quite easy for Us."
Qâf,50,45,"We know best what they say, and you are not the one to coerce them. So advise by means of the Qur’an anyone who fears My threat of punishment."
The Winnowing Winds,51,1,"By the winds that blow and scatter,"
The Winnowing Winds,51,2,"And by the clouds that carry a heavy load (of water),"
The Winnowing Winds,51,3,"And by the vessels that float with elegance,"
The Winnowing Winds,51,4,"And by the angels that distribute work,"
The Winnowing Winds,51,5,Surely the promise (of the Hereafter) being made to you is absolutely true.
The Winnowing Winds,51,6,"And surely, the reward and the punishment (of actions) are bound to take place."
The Winnowing Winds,51,7,"And by the heaven with its galaxies and orbits (of stars and planets),"
The Winnowing Winds,51,8,Certainly you are (caught) in inconsistent statements.
The Winnowing Winds,51,9,He alone who is turned away (from the knowledge of pre-eternity) turns away (from the Holy Messenger [blessings and peace be upon him] and the Qur’an).
The Winnowing Winds,51,10,"Ruined are those who tell lies out of assumption and conjecture,"
The Winnowing Winds,51,11,Those who are oblivious (of the Hereafter) due to negligence and ignorance.
The Winnowing Winds,51,12,They ask: ‘When is the Day of Requital?’
The Winnowing Winds,51,13,(Say:) ‘The Day (when) they will be roasted in the Fire of Hell.’
The Winnowing Winds,51,14,(It will be said to them:) ‘Relish your punishment. It is this punishment which you seek to hasten.’
The Winnowing Winds,51,15,"Surely, the pious will be (rejoicing) in gardens and springs,"
The Winnowing Winds,51,16,"Receiving those blessings (in ecstatic delight) which their Lord will be giving them (with munificence and benevolence). Surely, it is they who were people of spiritual excellence (in their life) before this."
The Winnowing Winds,51,17,"They used to sleep at night only for a short while,"
The Winnowing Winds,51,18,And used to (get up and) seek forgiveness in the later part of the night.
The Winnowing Winds,51,19,"And in their wealth was appointed a due share for the beggars and the destitute (i.e., all the needy)."
The Winnowing Winds,51,20,"And there are many signs in the earth for the people with the truth of certitude (i.e., people of perfect certitude),"
The Winnowing Winds,51,21,And in your selves (as well). So do you not notice?
The Winnowing Winds,51,22,And (also) there is sustenance for you in the heaven and (all that too) which you are promised.
The Winnowing Winds,51,23,"So, by the Lord of heavens and the earth, this (promise of Ours) is true just as is your speech. (You firmly believe in what you utter.)"
The Winnowing Winds,51,24,Has the news of the venerable guests of Ibrahim (Abraham) come to you?
The Winnowing Winds,51,25,"When those (angels) came to him, they wished him peace. Ibrahim (Abraham) also said (in reply): ‘Peace (be upon you)!’ (and thought in his mind that) they were strangers."
The Winnowing Winds,51,26,"Then he went to his home in haste and brought a healthy, roasted calf."
The Winnowing Winds,51,27,Then he presented it to them and said: ‘Will you not eat?’
The Winnowing Winds,51,28,"Then he felt somewhat concerned about them (when they did not eat). They (the angels) said: ‘Do not worry,’ then they gave him the news about a son possessing knowledge and wisdom (Ishaq [Isaac])."
The Winnowing Winds,51,29,"Then his wife (Sara) came with a voice laden with wonder and frustration, patted her forehead in astonishment and said: ‘(Will) an old and barren woman (give birth to a child)?’"
The Winnowing Winds,51,30,"The (angels) said: ‘It will happen exactly as your Lord has said; surely, He is Most Wise, All-Knowing.’"
The Winnowing Winds,51,31,"Ibrahim (Abraham) said: ‘O deputed angels, what is your intent (for coming, apart from this good news)?’"
The Winnowing Winds,51,32,"They said: ‘We have been sent to the evildoing people (the people of Lut [Lot]),"
The Winnowing Winds,51,33,"So that we may rain on them THE the stones of baked clay,"
The Winnowing Winds,51,34,(The stones) that have been marked from your Lord for those who transgress.’
The Winnowing Winds,51,35,Then We moved everyone who was of the believers in it out (from the town of the people of Lut [Lot]).
The Winnowing Winds,51,36,So We did not find in that town (any house) of the Muslims except one (in which were the Prophet Lut [Lot] and his two daughters).
The Winnowing Winds,51,37,And We made in that (town) a sign to subsist (as a lesson of warning) for those who fear the grievous torment.
The Winnowing Winds,51,38,And (there are signs) in (the incident of) Musa (Moses) as well when We sent him to Pharaoh with clear proof.
The Winnowing Winds,51,39,He turned away along with his cabinet members and said: ‘(Here is) a magician or a madman.’
The Winnowing Winds,51,40,"Then We seized him and his army (with torment), and drowned them (all) in the river. And he was but the perpetrator of condemnable works."
The Winnowing Winds,51,41,And there is (a sign) in (the destruction of) the people of ‘Ad too when We sent upon them a wind devoid of any good and blessing.
The Winnowing Winds,51,42,"Whatever it passed over, it did not leave without turning it to dust."
The Winnowing Winds,51,43,And also there is (a sign of warning) in the (destruction of) the people of Thamud when they were told: ‘Take benefit for an appointed term.’
The Winnowing Winds,51,44,"But they disobeyed the command of their Lord. So a horrifying thunder seized them, and they could only stare at it stunned."
The Winnowing Winds,51,45,"Then they could neither gather strength to stand, nor take revenge (on Us)."
The Winnowing Winds,51,46,"And (We also destroyed) the people of Nuh (Noah) before this. Surely, they were a people extremely disobedient."
The Winnowing Winds,51,47,"And We built the heavenly universe with great might. And surely, We are expanding (this universe) more and more."
The Winnowing Winds,51,48,And We alone made (the surface of the) earth a (livable) floor. So how graciously We make up and spread out!
The Winnowing Winds,51,49,And of everything We have created two pairs so that you may concentrate and understand.
The Winnowing Winds,51,50,"So run towards Allah. Surely, I am a clear Warner to you from Him."
The Winnowing Winds,51,51,"And do not set up any god apart from Allah. Surely, I am a clear Warner to you from Him."
The Winnowing Winds,51,52,"Likewise, no Messenger came to those before them, but they said the same: ‘(This is) a magician or a madman.’"
The Winnowing Winds,51,53,"Were they transmitting this advice to one another? In truth, they were (all) a disobedient and rebellious people."
The Winnowing Winds,51,54,So turn away your kind and caring looks from them. There is no blame on you (for their disbelief).
The Winnowing Winds,51,55,"And keep giving direction and guidance, for direction and guidance surely benefits the believers."
The Winnowing Winds,51,56,And I created the jinn and human beings solely to adopt My servitude.
The Winnowing Winds,51,57,"I do not ask for any sustenance (i.e., earning) from them, nor do I require that they should feed Me."
The Winnowing Winds,51,58,"Truly, Allah alone is the Sustainer of everyone, the Lord of Great Might, the Most Strong. (He does not need anyone’s help and assistance.)"
The Winnowing Winds,51,59,So there is a fixed share of the torment for these wrongdoers (too) like the share of the torment of their companions (who have passed before). So let them not ask Me to hasten (it).
The Winnowing Winds,51,60,So a terrible destruction awaits the disbelievers on that Day of theirs which they have been promised.
The Mount,52,1,"By (the Mountain) Tur,"
The Mount,52,2,"And by the Book inscribed,"
The Mount,52,3,"(Which is) on an Unfolded Scroll,"
The Mount,52,4,"And by the House populated (by the angels i.e., the Ka‘ba in heaven),"
The Mount,52,5,"And by the Lofty Roof (i.e., the High Heaven or the Most Exalted Throne),"
The Mount,52,6,And by the swelling sea!
The Mount,52,7,"Surely, the torment of your Lord will do take place."
The Mount,52,8,No one can avert it.
The Mount,52,9,"The Day when the heaven will shake with a terrible tremor,"
The Mount,52,10,"And the mountains (leaving their locations) will fly fast (like clouds) and scatter (like dust particles),"
The Mount,52,11,"So on that Day, woe to those who belie,"
The Mount,52,12,"Those who are playing a game of negligence, rapt in falsehood (i.e., absurdity)."
The Mount,52,13,"The Day when they will be forcefully pushed towards the Fire of Hell,"
The Mount,52,14,(It will be said to them:) ‘This is the Fire of Hell you used to belie.
The Mount,52,15,"So is it magic, or do you not see?"
The Mount,52,16,"Enter it. Then it is all the same for you whether you observe patience, or you do not observe patience. You will be paid only for those deeds which you used to do.’"
The Mount,52,17,"Surely, the Godfearing will be in the Gardens and Bliss."
The Mount,52,18,They will be delighted at (the bestowals) their Lord will have blessed them with. And their Lord will keep them safe from the punishment of Hell.
The Mount,52,19,(It will be said to them:) ‘Relish food and drink as a reward for the (pious) deeds which you used to do.’
The Mount,52,20,"They will be reclining (sitting) on couches arranged in rows, and We will marry them to maidens with fair colour (and) fascinating eyes."
The Mount,52,21,"And those who believe and whose children follow them in faith, We shall also unite their children with them (in the ranks of Paradise even if their actions would not fall in that grade. It would be in the honour of their pious fathers). And We shall also not reduce in anyway the reward of the actions of their (pious fathers. Besides this,) everyone will be held in (reward and punishment for) his own works."
The Mount,52,22,And We will keep giving them fruit and meat more and more as they desire.
The Mount,52,23,"There, they will take the cups (of holy drink) by grabbing. This (holy drink of Paradise) will be free of foolish talk and sinful acts."
The Mount,52,24,And (the serving) youths will go round them as if they were pearls kept hidden in covers.
The Mount,52,25,"And they will turn to one another, enquiring well-being."
The Mount,52,26,"They will say: ‘Surely before this, we used to live in fear (of Allah’s torment) in our homes."
The Mount,52,27,So Allah has been Gracious to favour us and has saved us from the punishment of the Fire of Hell.
The Mount,52,28,"Indeed, we used to worship Him alone beforehand. Surely, He is Most Gracious, Ever-Merciful.’"
The Mount,52,29,"So, (O Esteemed Beloved,) continue to admonish (them). By the grace and blessing of your Lord, you are neither a soothsayer (the one who gives news through the jinn) nor a madman."
The Mount,52,30,Do the disbelievers say: ‘(He is) a poet for whom we look forward to some temporal disasters’?
The Mount,52,31,"Say: ‘Wait on, I am also waiting together with you (for your destruction).’"
The Mount,52,32,"Do their mental faculties suggest them this (foolishness), or are they rioters and rebels?"
The Mount,52,33,Or do they say: ‘He (the Messenger) has invented it (the Qur’an) himself’? (No indeed;) rather they simply do not believe (in the truth).
The Mount,52,34,So let them produce a treatise like this (Qur’an) if they are truthful.
The Mount,52,35,"Have they been created by nothing, or are they themselves the creators?"
The Mount,52,36,"Or did they create the heavens and the earth themselves? (No,) in fact, they do not have any faith (in the truth)."
The Mount,52,37,Or do they own the treasures of your Lord? Or are they guards and watchmen over them?
The Mount,52,38,Or do they have any ladder (by which they ascend) and listen stealthily (to the heaven)? So let the listener amongst them bring the clear proof.
The Mount,52,39,Are there daughters for Him (the Lord) and sons for you?
The Mount,52,40,Do you ask them for wages that they are weighed down with debt?
The Mount,52,41,Do they have (the knowledge of) the unseen that they write down?
The Mount,52,42,Do they seek to deceive (you) by trickery? Those who disbelieve are being caught in their own trap.
The Mount,52,43,"Do they have any god other than Allah? Glory be to Allah, above all what they set up as a partner (with Allah)."
The Mount,52,44,"And if they see a fragment of the sky falling (on them, even then) they will say: ‘It is a layered (thick) cloud.’"
The Mount,52,45,"So leave them (in their plight) till they meet that Day of theirs when they will be destroyed,"
The Mount,52,46,"The Day when their plots will be of no use to them, nor will they be helped."
The Mount,52,47,"And for those who are committed to doing wrong, there is a torment for them besides this torment as well but most of them do not know."
The Mount,52,48,"And, (O Esteemed Beloved, do not grieve over what they say). Wait patiently for the command of your Lord. Surely, you are (at all times) before Our Eyes.* And glorify your Lord with His praise whenever you stand forth."
The Mount,52,49,And also glorify Him during the hours of the night and (in later part of it) when the stars fade out.
The Star,53,1,By the bright star (Muhammad [blessings and peace be upon him]) when (he ascended during the Ascension Night in the twinkling of an eye and) descended.
The Star,53,2,"He who bestowed on you his companionship (i.e., the Messenger, who made you his companions by blessing you with his companionship,) has never lost his way, nor has he (ever) strayed from the right path."
The Star,53,3,And he does not speak out of his (own) desire.
The Star,53,4,"His speech is nothing but Revelation, which is sent to him."
The Star,53,5,"(The Lord) of Mighty Powers (directly) conferred on him (perfect) knowledge,"
The Star,53,6,He Who is absolute beauty. Then He (the Effulgence of Beauty) decided to unveil (Himself).
The Star,53,7,"And he (Muhammad [blessings and peace be upon him]) was on the uppermost horizon (of the realm of creation during the Ascension Night i.e., on the apex of the created cosmos)."
The Star,53,8,Then He (the Lord of Honour) drew closer (to His Beloved Muhammad [blessings and peace be upon him]) and then drew even closer.*
The Star,53,9,"Then a distance measuring only two bow-lengths was left (between Allah Unveiled and His Esteemed Beloved), or even less than that (in extreme nearness)."
The Star,53,10,So (on that station of nearness) He (Allah) revealed to His (Beloved) servant whatever He revealed.
The Star,53,11,(His) heart did not take it contrary to what (his) eyes beheld.
The Star,53,12,Do you argue with him about what he saw?
The Star,53,13,"And assuredly, he saw Him (Allah Unveiled) the second time (again and you argue only about seeing Him once).*"
The Star,53,14,"At the farthest Lote-Tree—Sidra al-Muntaha,"
The Star,53,15,"Adjacent to that is the Eternal Paradise—Janna al-Ma’wa,"
The Star,53,16,"When theophanies (i.e., effulgent disclosures) of the divine light wrapped up al-Sidra (the Lote-Tree at the Far End), covering it expansively.*"
The Star,53,17,His eye neither inclined aside nor overstepped the limit; (it gazed in ecstasy at Whom it was to gaze).
The Star,53,18,"Surely, he saw the greatest signs of His Lord (during the Ascension Night)."
The Star,53,19,Have you taken a look at (the goddesses) Lat and ‘Uzza?
The Star,53,20,"And (have you) also (seen thoughtfully) another, that third one (goddess) Manat? (Have you declared them daughters of Allah?)"
The Star,53,21,(O idolaters!) Are sons for you and daughters for Him (Allah)?
The Star,53,22,"(If your concept is correct,) then that division is serious injustice."
The Star,53,23,"But (the truth is that) these (idols) are nothing but mere names which you and your fathers have given. Allah has not sent down any authority for them. They follow only whims and suspicions and the desires of their (ill-commanding) selves, whereas guidance has already come to them from their Lord."
The Star,53,24,Is (all) that available for man what he longs for?
The Star,53,25,So Allah alone is the Master of the Hereafter and the world.
The Star,53,26,"And how many angels there are in the heavens (whom the disbelievers and the idolaters worship and expect from them intercession but) whose intercession will be of no use at all, except after Allah (awards) permission for whom He wills and likes!"
The Star,53,27,"Surely, those who do not believe in the Hereafter give the angels female names."
The Star,53,28,"And they know nothing about it. They follow only assumption, and surely assumption serves no purpose in comparison with certitude."
The Star,53,29,So divert your attention from him who turns away from Our remembrance and desires nothing but the life of this world.
The Star,53,30,"That is but the limit of the working of their knowledge. Verily, your Lord fully knows him who has strayed from His path and (also) knows best him who has attained guidance."
The Star,53,31,And to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth so that He recompenses the acts of those who have committed vices and gives good reward to those who have performed virtues.
The Star,53,32,"Those who guard against grave sins and indecencies excepting small sins (and omissions), surely your Lord has vast prospects of forgiveness (for them). He knows you best when He originated your life and nourishment from the earth (i.e., soil) and when you were embryos (conceived) in your mothers’ wombs. So never pose yourselves as clean and pure; He knows best who is (really) pious."
The Star,53,33,Have you seen him who has turned away (from the truth)?
The Star,53,34,And he gave away a little (wealth in the way of Allah) and (then) held back (his hand)?
The Star,53,35,Does he have the knowledge of the unseen that he can see?
The Star,53,36,"Has he not been given the knowledge of (matters) mentioned in the scriptures of Musa (Moses),"
The Star,53,37,"And in the (scriptures) of Ibrahim (Abraham), who accomplished (all the commands of Allah) with perfection?"
The Star,53,38,That no bearer of a burden will carry the burden of (the sins) of another;
The Star,53,39,"And that man (according to justice) will get only that for which he strives. (As for bounty, no one has any right to it. That is merely Allah’s bestowal and pleasure, granting as much as He wills to whom He pleases.)"
The Star,53,40,"And that all his endeavours will soon be shown (i.e., exposed)."
The Star,53,41,Then he will be given full reward (for all his endeavours);
The Star,53,42,And that (ultimately all) have to return to your Lord;
The Star,53,43,And that He is the One Who makes one laugh (granting delight) and makes one weep (granting grief);
The Star,53,44,And that He is the One Who causes death and gives life;
The Star,53,45,"And that He is the One Who has created the two genders, male and female,"
The Star,53,46,Out of a (sperm) drop when it is ejaculated (into the mother’s womb);
The Star,53,47,And that it is upon Him alone to raise up alive (also after death);
The Star,53,48,"And that He is the One Who makes self-sufficient (by providing according to needs), and He is the One Who enriches treasures (by giving surplus to the needs);"
The Star,53,49,And that He alone is the Lord of Sirius (a star that was worshipped in the days of ignorance);
The Star,53,50,"And that He is the One Who destroyed the first (people of) ‘Ad,"
The Star,53,51,And (the people of) Thamud (as well). Then He did not spare (any of them) to survive.
The Star,53,52,"And before that, He destroyed the people of Nuh ([Noah] as well). Surely, they were extremely wicked and exceedingly defiant."
The Star,53,53,And He is the One Who (raised up) the overturned towns (of the people of Lut [Lot]) and smashed them down.
The Star,53,54,"Then covered them that which did cover (i.e., the stones were rained on them)."
The Star,53,55,"So, (O man,) which of the favours of your Lord will you doubt?"
The Star,53,56,This (Holy Prophet [blessings and peace be upon him]) is also a Warner of the Warners of old.
The Star,53,57,The imminent (Hour of Judgment) has drawn near.
The Star,53,58,No one except Allah can bring it forth (and establish).
The Star,53,59,So do you wonder at this Revelation?
The Star,53,60,"And do you laugh and not weep,"
The Star,53,61,Whilst you are busy playing a game (of negligence)?
The Star,53,62,So prostrate yourselves before Allah and worship (Him).
The Moon,54,1,The Last Hour has drawn near and the moon has split into two.
The Moon,54,2,"And if they (the disbelievers) see a sign (a miracle), they turn their faces away and say: ‘This is the powerful magic ever running down through ages.’"
The Moon,54,3,And they have rejected (the truth even now) and followed their vain desires. And everything (that has been promised) is to take place at the appointed time.
The Moon,54,4,"And indeed, the news has come to them (of the earlier communities) containing lessons of warning and admonition (on disbelief and disobedience)."
The Moon,54,5,(This Qur’an) is perfect intellect and reason. Are the Warners still not of any benefit?
The Moon,54,6,"So turn your face away from them. The Day when the caller (angel) will call towards the most detestable thing (the expanse of the last assembly),"
The Moon,54,7,"With eyes cast down, they will come out of their graves like scattered locusts,"
The Moon,54,8,Rushing towards the caller running. The disbelievers will say: ‘This is a very hard Day.’
The Moon,54,9,"The people of Nuh (Noah) also denied before this. So they belied Our servant (Nuh [Noah], the Messenger) and said: ‘(He) is mad.’ And he was given threats."
The Moon,54,10,So he prayed to his Lord: ‘I am powerless (before the transgressions of my people) so exact revenge.’
The Moon,54,11,Then We opened the gates of heaven with torrential rain.
The Moon,54,12,And We burst springs from the earth. So the water (of the earth and the heaven) collected for the same purpose that had been decreed already (for their destruction).
The Moon,54,13,"And We carried him (Nuh [Noah]) in the (Ark) built with planks and nails,"
The Moon,54,14,"Which floated before Our eyes (under Our security. All this) was done to exact revenge for him, Nuh (Noah), who was rejected."
The Moon,54,15,"And surely, We made (the ruins of the Deluge) subsist as a sign. So is there anyone who will think (and take advice)?"
The Moon,54,16,So how My torment and My warning were!
The Moon,54,17,"And indeed, We have made the Qur’an easy for direction and guidance, but is there anyone who will take advice?"
The Moon,54,18,(The people of) ‘Ad too rejected (the Messengers). So how (awful) My torment (upon them) and My warning were!
The Moon,54,19,"Surely, We sent upon them a howling windstorm on a day of lasting evil (in their favour),"
The Moon,54,20,That plucked out people as if they were uprooted stems of date-palms.
The Moon,54,21,Then how (awful) My torment and My warning were!
The Moon,54,22,"And indeed, We have made the Qur’an easy for direction and guidance, but is there anyone who will take advice?"
The Moon,54,23,(The people of) Thamud also rejected the Warning Messengers.
The Moon,54,24,So they said: ‘Are we to follow a human being who is one of us? Then we shall certainly run into error and insanity.
The Moon,54,25,"Has the direction and guidance (Revelation) been sent down to him alone out of all of us? The truth is that he is a great liar, self-conceited (and arrogant).’"
The Moon,54,26,"They will come to know tomorrow (on the Day of Judgment) who is a great liar, self-conceited (and arrogant)."
The Moon,54,27,"Indeed, We are going to send a she-camel for them to test them. So, (O Salih,) wait for their (end) and continue observing patience."
The Moon,54,28,And make it known to them that water has been divided between them (and the she-camel). Everyone will be served with the share of water by turn.
The Moon,54,29,So they called one of their companions (named Qidar). He attacked (the she-camel with a sword) and hamstrung her.
The Moon,54,30,Then how (awful) My torment and My warning were!
The Moon,54,31,"Verily, We sent upon them a terrible roar. So they became like a thatcher’s trampled stubble."
The Moon,54,32,"And indeed, We have made the Qur’an easy for direction and guidance, but is there anyone who will take advice?"
The Moon,54,33,The people of Lut (Lot) also rejected the Warners.
The Moon,54,34,"Surely, We sent a windstorm raining stones upon them except the family of Lut (Lot). We saved them (from the torment) in the later part of the night,"
The Moon,54,35,"With a special favour from Us. In the same way, We give reward to him who gives thanks."
The Moon,54,36,"And no doubt, Lut (Lot) warned them of Our seizure but, having doubts about his warnings, they denied."
The Moon,54,37,"And indeed, they made up their minds to snatch from Lut (Lot) his guests. So We erased the structure of their eyes and stripped them of sight, then (said to them:) ‘Taste My punishment and warning.’"
The Moon,54,38,"And surely, the everlasting punishment reached them early in the morning."
The Moon,54,39,Then (it was said to them:) ‘Taste My punishment and warning.’
The Moon,54,40,"And indeed, We have made the Qur’an easy for direction and guidance, but is there anyone who will take advice?"
The Moon,54,41,"And surely, the Warners came to the people of Pharaoh (as well)."
The Moon,54,42,"They denied all Our signs. Then We seized them with the seizure befitting the Glory of Almighty, All-Powerful."
The Moon,54,43,"(O Quraysh of Mecca!) Are your disbelievers better than the people (before), or has your salvation been written in the (revealed) Books?"
The Moon,54,44,Or do these (disbelievers) say: ‘We are a strong party dominant (over the Prophet [blessings and peace be upon him])’?
The Moon,54,45,"Soon this party will be defeated (in the battlefield of Badr), and they will flee away, turning their backs."
The Moon,54,46,"But their (actual) promise is the Last Hour, and the Last Hour is extremely terrible and most agonizing."
The Moon,54,47,"Assuredly, the evildoers are in (the fold of) error and insanity (or Fire)."
The Moon,54,48,The Day when they will be dragged into Hell on their faces (it will be said to them:) ‘Taste burning in Hell.’
The Moon,54,49,"Surely, We have created everything according to a fixed measure."
The Moon,54,50,And Our command comes into action once and for all as the twinkling of an eye.
The Moon,54,51,"And surely, We destroyed (many of) your groups. So is there anyone who will take advice?"
The Moon,54,52,And whatever they did is (recorded) in (their) Books of Deeds.
The Moon,54,53,"And every (action), small or big, has been written."
The Moon,54,54,"Indeed, the Godfearing will (rejoice) in gardens and streams,"
The Moon,54,55,And will (be seated) in special nearness to the Sovereign Lord of (true) power during holy sessions.
The Beneficent,55,1,"The Most Compassionate (is He),"
The Beneficent,55,2,Who (Himself) taught the Qur’an to (the Arab Messenger [blessings and peace be upon him]).*
The Beneficent,55,3,He is the One Who created (this Absolutely Perfect) man.
The Beneficent,55,4,"He alone taught him the art of expression and communication (i.e., taught the True Messenger ma kana wa ma yakun).*"
The Beneficent,55,5,The sun and the moon are rotating according to the configuration determined (by Him).

The Beneficent,55,7,"And He is the One Who has maintained the sky raised high and (He is the One) Who has set up the balance (for justice),"
The Beneficent,55,8,So that you violate not the balance whilst weighing.
The Beneficent,55,9,And keep weighing justly and do not make the balance fall short.
The Beneficent,55,10,He is the One Who has spread out the earth for the creatures.
The Beneficent,55,11,"There are fruits in it and blossom-bearing date-palms,"
The Beneficent,55,12,And chaff-covered grain and fragrant (fruits and) blooms.
The Beneficent,55,13,"So, (O assembly of jinn and men,) which of your Lord’s blessings will you deny?"
The Beneficent,55,14,"He is the One Who created man from a dry mud sounding like earthenware,"
The Beneficent,55,15,And created the jinn from a flame of fire.
The Beneficent,55,16,So which of your Lord’s blessings will you both deny?
The Beneficent,55,17,(He alone is) the Lord of the two easts and (He alone is) the Lord of the two wests.
The Beneficent,55,18,So which of your Lord’s blessings will you both deny?

The Beneficent,55,20,There is a barrier between them; they cannot breach (their respective) limits.

The Beneficent,55,34,So which of your Lord’s blessings will you both deny?
The Beneficent,55,35,"The flames of pure (i.e., smokeless) fire will be sent upon both of you and (flameless) smoke (too will be sent) and you both will be unable to escape from them."

The Beneficent,55,40,So which of your Lord’s blessings will you both deny?
The Beneficent,55,41,"The evildoers will be recognized by the darkness of their faces and so they will be pulled, seized by their forelocks and feet."
The Beneficent,55,42,So which of your Lord’s blessings will you both deny?
The Beneficent,55,43,(It will be said to them:) ‘It is this Hell which the evildoers used to deny.’
The Beneficent,55,44,They will move about in that (Hell) and in the boiling hot water.
The Beneficent,55,45,So which of your Lord’s blessings will you both deny?
The Beneficent,55,46,"And whoever fears standing before his Lord (for meeting), for him are two Gardens."
The Beneficent,55,47,So which of your Lord’s blessings will you both deny?

The Event,56,1,"When what is to occur (the Hour of Resurrection) will occur,"
The Event,56,2,There is no falsehood in its occurrence.
The Event,56,3,(That Hour) will lower (some) and raise (some others) high.
The Event,56,4,"When the earth will tremor and then shake violently,"
The Event,56,5,"And the mountains will be crumbled into bits,"
The Event,56,6,"Then will become dust particles spread in the air,"
The Event,56,7,And you will be divided into three classes.
The Event,56,8,So (first) those on the Right Hand; what a class the Right Hand will be!
The Event,56,9,And (second) those on the Left Hand; (in what miserable plight will be) the Left Hand party!
The Event,56,10,And (third) the Excellent; (they) are the Foremost.
The Event,56,11,It is they who will be the ones drawn near (to Allah).
The Event,56,12,(They will live) in the Gardens of Bliss.
The Event,56,13,A large group (of those drawn near) will be from the earlier people.
The Event,56,14,And a small number (amongst them) will be from the later generations.
The Event,56,15,"(Those drawn near) will be on the thrones ornamented with gold,"
The Event,56,16,"Reclining there on cushions, face to face."
The Event,56,17,"The serving youths, rapt always in the same state of being, will go round them."
The Event,56,18,"(They will be attending) carrying bowls, ewers and cups filled with (transparent) drink of (nearness) from the free-flowing springs."
The Event,56,19,"By (drinking) this, they will have neither headache nor derangement of senses (and stupefaction)."
The Event,56,20,"And (the servants of Paradise) will be (roaming about) with fruits which (the ones drawn near) will like,"
The Event,56,21,And (there will be) bird-meat as well which they (the ones drawn near) will desire.
The Event,56,22,"And also (in their companionship will be) maidens with wide lovely eyes,"
The Event,56,23,"Like pearls kept hidden, well-guarded."
The Event,56,24,(That) will be the reward of the (pious) works which they used to do.
The Event,56,25,"There they will hear nothing absurd nor any word of sin,"
The Event,56,26,"But (these people of peace will hear) only one thing (from all sides:) ‘Peace, Peace.’"
The Event,56,27,And those of the Right Hand; what a class the Right Hand are!
The Event,56,28,"Amid thornless lote-trees,"
The Event,56,29,"And layers of banana fruit,"
The Event,56,30,"And long-stretching, (wide-spreading) shades,"
The Event,56,31,"And flowing, gushing waters,"
The Event,56,32,And (they will be rejoicing) in abundance of fruits.
The Event,56,33,They will be neither exhausted nor restricted (to eat).
The Event,56,34,And (they) will be (staying) on raised (splendid) floors.
The Event,56,35,"Surely, We have created these (maidens) as a special creation (reflecting beauty and refinement)."
The Event,56,36,"Then We have made them virgins,"
The Event,56,37,The ardently loving (wives) of the same age.
The Event,56,38,These (maidens and other bounties) are for those on the Right Hand.
The Event,56,39,A large group of them will be from the earlier people.
The Event,56,40,And from later generations will (also) be a large group (amongst them).
The Event,56,41,And those of the Left Hand; what (an evil people) on the Left Hand are!
The Event,56,42,"They will be amid fierce, hot wind of Hell and simmering water,"
The Event,56,43,And under the shadow of black smoke.
The Event,56,44,That will neither (ever) cool nor be pleasing.
The Event,56,45,"No doubt, these (inmates of Hell) lived luxuriously before this (in the world),"
The Event,56,46,And obstinately persisted in great sin (of denying Allah and setting up partners with Him).
The Event,56,47,"And they used to say: ‘When we are dead and become (a heap of) dust and (decomposed bones), shall we then be raised up (alive again)?"
The Event,56,48,And shall our ancestors too (be given life)?’
The Event,56,49,"Say: ‘Indeed, the earlier and the later,"
The Event,56,50,(All of them) will be gathered together on a fixed Hour of an appointed Day.
The Event,56,51,"Then surely, O strayed people, deniers,"
The Event,56,52,"You will certainly eat of thorny (cactus) tree,"
The Event,56,53,And will fill your stomachs with it.
The Event,56,54,"And (you) will drink boiling water over it,"
The Event,56,55,Drinking as a thirst-stricken camel drinks.’
The Event,56,56,This will be their feast on the Day of Resurrection.
The Event,56,57,It is We Who created you. Then why do you not confirm (resurrection)?
The Event,56,58,"Well, give your view: the semen (sperm drop) that you ejaculate (into the womb)—"
The Event,56,59,"Is it you who create (a human being) from it, or are We the Creator?"
The Event,56,60,"It is We Who have decreed death amongst you, and We are not helpless either (to bring you back to life after this)."
The Event,56,61,Nor are We (powerless) to change others into the like of you in your place and make you grow into a form which you do not know.
The Event,56,62,"And surely, you have learnt (the reality of) the first creation. Then why do you not accept advice?"
The Event,56,63,"Well, give your view: the (seed) that you cultivate—"
The Event,56,64,"Is it you who make (the crop) grow from it, or are We its Grower?"
The Event,56,65,"If We so intend, We would crumble it to pieces. Then you would only be struck with awe and shame!"
The Event,56,66,(And you may say:) ‘We are punished with ransom;
The Event,56,67,Rather we are seized by misfortune.’
The Event,56,68,"Well, give your view: the water that you drink—"
The Event,56,69,"Have you sent it down from the cloud, or are We its Sender?"
The Event,56,70,"If We will, We can make it bitter. Then why do you not give thanks?"
The Event,56,71,"Well, give your view: the fire that you kindle—"
The Event,56,72,"Have you grown its tree, or are We its Grower?"
The Event,56,73,"It is We Who have made it (the fire of tree) a reminder (of the Fire of Hell, an admonition and a warning) and a source of profit and comfort for the travellers in forests."
The Event,56,74,"So always glorify the Name of your Lord, Most Magnificent."
The Event,56,75,So I swear by the places where different portions of the Qur’an descend (on the Arab Messenger).*
The Event,56,76,And this is a mighty oath if you realize.
The Event,56,77,"Surely, this is a Glorious Qur’an (which is being sent down on the most Glorious Messenger [blessings and peace be upon him])."
The Event,56,78,It has been (inscribed) in al-Lawh al-Mahfuz (the Preserved Tablet) before this.
The Event,56,79,No one can touch it except the purified (and cleansed) ones.
The Event,56,80,It has been sent down by the Lord of all the worlds.
The Event,56,81,So is it this Revelation that you disdain?
The Event,56,82,And you have made your means of subsistence (and fortune) to reject it!
The Event,56,83,Then why do you not (make the soul return) when it reaches the throat (to pass away)?
The Event,56,84,"And at that moment, you do nothing but helplessly look on!"
The Event,56,85,And We are nearer to him (the dying one) than you but you do not see (Us).
The Event,56,86,"Then if you are under no one’s command and control, why do you not (do this),"
The Event,56,87,That you turn that soul back if you are truthful?
The Event,56,88,"Then if he (who died) was of those drawn near,"
The Event,56,89,"For him is Paradise packed with bounties, pleasure and delight and spiritual sustenance and comforts."
The Event,56,90,"And if he was of those on the Right Hand,"
The Event,56,91,"Then (it will be said to him:) ‘Peace for you from those on the Right Hand! (Or, O Prophet, peace on you from those on the Right Hand!)’"
The Event,56,92,"But if he (who died) was of the strayed beliers,"
The Event,56,93,"Then he will be entertained with scalding, boiling water."
The Event,56,94,And his (end) is the admission to Hell.
The Event,56,95,"Assuredly, this is the absolute truth of certitude."
The Event,56,96,"So always glorify the Name of your Lord, Most Magnificent."
Iron,57,1,"All those who are in the heavens and the earth glorify Allah alone, and only He is the Lord of Honour, Most Wise."
Iron,57,2,"His is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. He is the One Who gives life and causes death, and He wields Absolute Power over everything."
Iron,57,3,He is the One Who is the First (of all) and the Last (of all). And He is Manifest (as for His Power) and Hidden (as goes His Essence). And He knows everything full well.
Iron,57,4,"He is the One Who created the heavens and the earth in six periods, then unveiled His Might taking the Throne of sovereignty of the universe (i.e., organized the whole universe under His command befitting His Glory). He knows what goes into the earth and what comes out of it, and what descends (or comes forth) from the heavenly bodies or what ascends to (or goes into) them. Wherever you are, He is with you. And Allah monitors best what you do."
Iron,57,5,"His is the entire kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and to Him are returned all the affairs."
Iron,57,6,He is the One Who makes the night pass into the day and the day pass into the night. And He is also Well Aware of the (hidden) contents of the hearts.
Iron,57,7,"Believe in Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) and spend (in His cause) out of that (wealth) in which He has made you His vicegerents (and trustees). So those of you who believe and spend (in His way), for them is mighty reward."
Iron,57,8,"And what is the matter with you that you do not believe in Allah whilst the Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) is giving you the call to believe in your Lord? And surely, Allah has already taken a firm covenant from you if you are believers."
Iron,57,9,"He is the One Who sends down clear signs to His (exalted) servant so that He may bring you out of the darkness into the light. Surely, Allah is the Most Clement, Ever-Merciful towards you."
Iron,57,10,"And what is the matter with you that you do not spend in the way of Allah, whereas the ownership of the heavens and the earth belongs to Allah alone (you are merely His vicegerents)? Those of you who spent (their wealth in the way of Allah before Meccan Victory) and fought (in their defence), they (and you) cannot be equal. They are far higher in rank than those who spent their wealth afterwards and fought. But Allah has promised the most pleasing end (i.e., Paradise) to all in the Hereafter. And Allah is Well Aware of what you do."
Iron,57,11,Who will make a good loan to Allah so that He may increase it (the loan) for him manifold? And a generous reward awaits him.
Iron,57,12,(O Beloved!) The Day when you will see the believing men and the believing women (of your Umma [Community]) with their light heading fast in front of them and on their right (it will be said to them:) ‘Good news to you. Today there are Gardens for you with streams flowing under them. (You) will live in them forever. That is but a great success.’
Iron,57,13,"The Day when the hypocritical men and the hypocritical women will say to the believers: ‘Look towards us (also a little considerately) so that we may take some of your light,’ it will be said to them: ‘Go back and look for light (there where you used to deny the light).’ So a wall will be raised between them (just then) with a door in it. Inside it will be mercy, and outside it will be torment from that direction."
Iron,57,14,"They (the hypocrites) will call out those (believers), saying: ‘Were we not in your company (in the world)?’ They will say: ‘Yes indeed! But you troubled yourselves with the disruption (of hypocrisy) and used to wait (for our woe and destruction). And you doubted (the Prophethood of Muhammad [blessings and peace be upon him] and the Din [Religion of Islam]), and your false hopes deceived you till the command of Allah (i.e., death) reached, and the Arch-Deceiver (Satan) kept deluding you about Allah."
Iron,57,15,"So T oday, (O hypocrites,) no recompense will be accepted from you or from those who disbelieved. Hell is the abode for you (all). And it is this (abode) which is your mawla (companion). And quite an evil resort is that (because you denied accepting those as mawla from whom the charity of the light of faith and forgiveness is obtained)."
Iron,57,16,"Has the time not (yet) come for the believers that their hearts get humbled with tenderness for the remembrance of Allah, and for that truth (as well) which has been sent down, and that they do not become like those who were given the Book before this, then a long time passed over them and their hearts hardened? And many of them are disobedient."
Iron,57,17,"Know that Allah alone brings the earth to life after it is dead. And surely, We have made signs clear for you so that you may put your reason to work."
Iron,57,18,"Surely, both the men and the women who give charity and those who lend a goodly loan to Allah, the (reward of charity) will be increased for them manifold, and there will be most honourable reward for them."
Iron,57,19,"And those who believe in Allah and His Messengers are al-siddiqun (the champions of truth) and al-shuhada’ (the faithful witnesses) in the sight of their Lord. For them is their reward and their light (as well), and those who disbelieved and denied Our Revelations, it is they who are the inmates of Hell."
Iron,57,20,"Know that the life of the world is nothing but a sport and pastime, and superficial beauty, and mutual boasting and self-praise, and ambition to excel in wealth and children over one another. Its similitude is rain whose produce pleases the farmers. Then it dries up. Then you see it turning yellow and then it becomes bits of stubble. And there is severe torment (for the disobedient) in the Hereafter, and forgiveness and great pleasure from Allah (for the obedient). And the life of the world is nothing but belongings that deceive."
Iron,57,21,"(O servants!) Race in pursuit of forgiveness from your Lord and towards Paradise (also) which is as wide as the vast expanse of the heaven and the earth, prepared for those who believe in Allah and His Messengers. This is Allah’s bounty which He gives to whom He wills. And Allah is the Lord of infinite bounty."
Iron,57,22,"No calamity occurs in the earth or in your lives but it is in a Book (al-Lawh al-Mahfuz, the station of Allah’s pre-eternal knowledge,) before We make it happen. Surely, this (all-encompassing and perfect knowledge) is very easy for Allah,"
Iron,57,23,"So that you may not grieve over what goes out of your hands, nor gloat in pride over what He grants you. And Allah does not like anyone arrogant and proud—"
Iron,57,24,"They who are (themselves) miserly and (also) urge others to be miserly. And he who turns away from (Allah’s injunctions), then surely Allah is (also) Self-Sufficient, Most Praiseworthy."
Iron,57,25,"Verily, We sent Our Messengers with clear signs, and We sent down with them the Book and the balance of justice so that people might grow firm and stable in justice. And (of minerals) We brought forth iron in which there is a fierce force (for weapons and defence) and which has (multiple other) benefits for people (in industrial development). And (the purpose is) that Allah may bring to light the one who helps Him and His Messengers (i.e., the Din [Religion of Islam]) without seeing. Surely, Allah is (Himself) the All-Powerful, the Almighty."
Iron,57,26,"And indeed, We sent Nuh (Noah) and Ibrahim (Abraham), and We placed Prophethood and the revealed Book amongst their children. So (some) of them are rightly guided and most of them are disobedient."
Iron,57,27,"Then in the footsteps of these Messengers, We sent (other) Messengers and We sent ‘Isa, the son of Maryam (Jesus, the son of Mary) after them and gave him the Injil (the Gospel). And We created kindness and mercy in the hearts of those who were (the true) followers (of ‘Isa [Jesus]). And they themselves invented the innovation of monasticism. We did not prescribe it for them. But they (introduced this innovation of monasticism) merely to seek Allah’s pleasure. Then they could not practically keep and maintain that check which was its due (i.e., could not continue its spirit and discipline). So We paid those of them who believed (and continued the innovation of monasticism to seek the pleasure of Allah) their reward. And most of them (who left it and changed their ways) are disobedient."
Iron,57,28,"O believers! Become Godfearing and believe in His (Esteemed) Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him). He will bless you with two portions of His mercy and will bring about light for you to walk in (in the world and in the Hereafter) and will forgive you. And Allah is Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful."
Iron,57,29,"(The purpose of this exposition is) that the People of the Book may know that they have no control over Allah’s bounty, and that the entire bounty is in the Mighty Hand of Allah alone. He gives it to whom He likes, and Allah is the Lord of infinite bounty, Most Great."
She That Disputeth,58,1,"Indeed, Allah has heard the words of the woman who was arguing with you about her husband and was pleading with Allah. And Allah was hearing the mutual questions and answers of both of you. Surely, Allah is All-Hearing, All-Seeing."
She That Disputeth,58,2,"Those of you who separate their wives by zihar (i.e., they say to their wives: You are to me as my mother’s back. But by saying this) they do not become their mothers. Their mothers are only those who have given them birth. And no doubt they utter evil and false words. Surely, Allah is Most Forbearing, Most Forgiving."
She That Disputeth,58,3,"And those who separate their wives by zihar, but then seek to go back on what they have said, setting free a neck (a slave) is obligatory before they touch each other. This is what you are admonished. And Allah is Well Aware of the works that you do."
She That Disputeth,58,4,But the one who does not find (a slave) must fast for two consecutive months (as an obligation) before they touch each other. Then someone who is unable to do that must feed sixty poor people (under obligation). That is in order that you may keep your belief in Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him). And these are the limits (set by) Allah. And there is a painful punishment for the disbelievers.
She That Disputeth,58,5,"Indeed, those who maintain rivalry against Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) will be humiliated as those before them were humiliated. And surely, We have sent down clear Revelations, and there is humiliating torment for the disbelievers."
She That Disputeth,58,6,"On the Day when Allah will raise them up (giving life again), He will then inform them of their actions. Allah has counted up (their) every action whilst they have forgotten it. And Allah is Witness over (and Well Aware of) everything."
She That Disputeth,58,7,"(O man!) Do you not know that Allah knows all those things which are in the heavens and in the earth? There is no whisper of three (men) anywhere but He is their fourth (with His all-encompassing knowledge and awareness). Nor is there any whisper of five (men) but He is the sixth of them (with His all-encompassing knowledge). Nor of less or more than that but He is (always) with them wherever they are. Then on the Day of Rising, He will alert them to the actions that they used to do. Surely, Allah knows everything full well."
She That Disputeth,58,8,"Have you not seen those who were forbidden to whisper? Then they started doing the same that they were forbidden to do. And they whisper about sin and revolt and disobedience to the (Holy) Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him), and when they come to your presence, they greet you with the (unbecoming) words with which Allah has not greeted you and say in their hearts: ‘(If this Messenger [blessings and peace be upon him] is truthful then) why does Allah not punish us for what we say?’ (The punishment of) Hell is sufficient for them. They will enter it and it is an extremely evil abode."
She That Disputeth,58,9,"O believers! When you whisper amongst yourselves, whisper not sin, injustice, revolt and disobedience to the Holy Prophet (blessings and peace be upon him); but whisper piety and Godwariness and keep fearing Allah before Whom you all will be gathered."
She That Disputeth,58,10,"(Negative and destructive) whispering is (employed) by Satan alone so that he may cause anguish to the believers. But in truth, he (Satan) cannot do any harm to them (the believers) except by Allah’s command. And the believers should trust Allah alone."
She That Disputeth,58,11,"O believers! When it is said to you: ‘Open up and make room in your gatherings,’ then open up and make room. Allah will provide you with ample room. And when it is said: ‘Rise up,’ then rise up. Allah will raise those in ranks who believe from amongst you and who are given knowledge. And Allah is Well Aware of the works that you do."
She That Disputeth,58,12,"O believers! When you seek to submit some secret to the Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) in private, give something in charity before you submit your secret. This (action) is better and purer for you. But if you do not find anything (to offer in charity), then Allah is Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful."
She That Disputeth,58,13,"Are you worried about donating in charity before your submission to the Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) in secret? So when you did not do (that) and Allah lifted from you probe (i.e., relaxed this restriction), then establish Prayer and pay Zakat (the Alms-due) and obey Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) persistently. And Allah is Well Aware of all the deeds that you do."
She That Disputeth,58,14,Have you not seen those who make friends with such a party upon whom Allah sent wrath? They are neither of you nor of them and they take false oaths whilst they know.
She That Disputeth,58,15,"Allah has prepared for them severe punishment. Indeed, it is an evil (work) that they are doing."
She That Disputeth,58,16,"They have made their (false) oaths a shield. So they hinder (others) from the way of Allah. Consequently, there is a humiliating punishment for them."
She That Disputeth,58,17,Neither their wealth nor their children will ever be able to save them from (the punishment of) Allah. It is they who are the inmates of Hell. They will live in it forever.
She That Disputeth,58,18,"The Day when Allah will raise up all of them (giving life a second time), they will swear to Him (as well) as they swear to you. And they assume that they are on a (right) thing (i.e., path). Beware! They are liars."
She That Disputeth,58,19,Satan has gained mastery over them. So he has made them forget the remembrance of Allah. It is they who are Satan’s army. Know that indeed it is the party of Satan who are the losers.
She That Disputeth,58,20,"Surely, those who maintain enmity against Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him), it is they who are of the lowest of mankind."
She That Disputeth,58,21,"Allah has destined: ‘Most certainly, I and My Messengers will dominate.’ Surely, Allah is Most Strong, Almighty."
She That Disputeth,58,22,"You will never find those who believe in Allah and the Day of Rising making friends with anyone who is hostile to Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him), even though they are their fathers (and forefathers), or their sons (and grandsons), or their brothers, or their near relatives. It is they in whose hearts Allah has inscribed faith and has strengthened them with His spirit (i.e., special spiritual benefit). And He will admit them to the Gardens with streams flowing under them. They will live in them forever. Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Allah. It is they who are the party of (the devotees of) Allah. Remember! It is the party of (the devotees of) Allah that attain to the goal."
Exile,59,1,"Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth (all) glorify Allah and He alone is Almighty, Most Wise."
Exile,59,2,"He is the One Who collected the disbelievers from amongst the People of the Book (i.e., the tribe of Banu Nadir) from their houses and banished them the first time (from Medina towards Syria). You did not (even) think that they would go away, and they thought that their strong fortresses would save them from (the seizure of) Allah. Then (the torment of) Allah came upon them from where they could not (even) imagine. And He (Allah) cast terror into their hearts, (and thus) they ruined their houses with their own hands and the believers’ hands. So, learn a lesson (from it), O people of vision!"
Exile,59,3,"And had Allah not written exile for them, He would have tormented them (more severely) in the world. And there is for them the punishment of Hell in the Hereafter (as well)."
Exile,59,4,"That is because they showed extreme enmity against Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him). (Their ringleader was Ka‘b b. Ashraf, a notorious denigrator of the Holy Prophet [blessings and peace be upon him].) And he who opposes Allah (and His Messenger), then Allah is Severe in punishment."
Exile,59,5,(O believers!) The palm-trees that you cut down or left standing upon their roots (during the siege of Banu Nadir tribe—it) was done by Allah’s command so that He might humiliate and disgrace the disobedient.
Exile,59,6,"And whatever spoils (materials of fay) Allah restored to His Messenger ([blessings and peace be upon him] taking out) from them, you galloped neither horses nor camels in (procuring) them. Yes indeed! Allah gives dominance and control to His Messengers over anyone He wills. And Allah has Absolute Power over everything."
Exile,59,7,"And whatever (materials of fay—spoils) Allah restored to His Messenger ([blessings and peace be upon him] taking out) from the people of (the towns captured without war in addition to those of Qurayza, Nadir, Fadak, Khaybar and ‘Urayna) belong to Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) and (the Messenger’s) near relatives (i.e., Banu Hashim and Banu ‘Abd al-Muttalib) and the orphans and the needy and the wayfarer (of society at large. This distribution system is to ensure) that (the whole wealth) may not circulate (only) amongst the rich of you (but should circulate amongst all the classes of society). And whatever the Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) gives you, take that and whatever he forbids you, abstain (from that) and keep fearing Allah (i.e., never scoff at the Messenger’s distribution and award). Surely, Allah is Severe to punish."
Exile,59,8,(The fore-mentioned fay materials) are (also) for the poor Emigrants who are driven out of their houses and possessions (and properties). They seek Allah’s bounty and His favour and pleasure. And they help Allah and His Messenger ([blessings and peace be upon him] by sacrificing their possessions and homeland). It is they who are the true believers.
Exile,59,9,"(These spoils are for those Ansar [Supporters] as well) who had taken the city (of Medina) and the faith as their home before (the Emigrants came). They love those who have come to them as Emigrants, and do not feel any need (or niggardly feeling) in their hearts pertaining to that (wealth) which is given to the Emigrants, and prefer them to themselves, even though they may themselves be in dire need. And he who is saved from the miserliness of his (ill-commanding) self, it is they who are successful and victorious."
Exile,59,10,"And those (too) who came after these (Emigrants and the Ansar [Supporters]) submit: ‘O our Lord, forgive us and our brothers who have preceded in embracing faith. And let not any spite and rancour be in our hearts against the believers. O our Lord, surely, You are Most Clement, Ever-Merciful.’"
Exile,59,11,"Have you not seen the hypocrites who say to their brothers amongst the People of the Book who have become disbelievers: ‘If you are driven out (from here), we too will necessarily leave with you and will never obey anyone in your case, and if you are attacked, we will most certainly help you’? But Allah bears witness that they are certainly liars."
Exile,59,12,"If they (the mischief-monger Jews) are driven out (from Medina), these (hypocrites) will never leave with them. Nor will they help them if they are put to fight. But if (at all) they do come to their help, they will for sure flee, turning their backs. Then they will not be helped (from anywhere)."
Exile,59,13,"(O Muslims!) Indeed, they have greater fear of you in their hearts than Allah’s. The reason is that they are the people who do not possess understanding."
Exile,59,14,"They (the Jews of Medina, who breached the treaty, and the hypocrites) will not be able to fight against you (even) allied, except in fortified towns or taking cover behind walls. They fight hard (but) amongst themselves. You think they are united, whereas their hearts are disunited. The reason is that they do not apply reason."
Exile,59,15,"(Their plight) resembles those who have tasted the evil consequences of their works shortly before them (i.e., the idolaters of Mecca in Badr and Banu Nadir, Banu Qaynuqa‘ and Banu Qurayza of the Jews, etc.). And there is for them a grievous punishment (in the Hereafter as well)."
Exile,59,16,"(The example of hypocrites) is like that of Satan when he says to man: ‘Become a disbeliever,’ but when he disbelieves, he (Satan) says: ‘I feel sick of you. Surely, I fear Allah, the Lord of all the worlds.’"
Exile,59,17,Then both of them will end up in Hell and will dwell in it forever. And that is indeed the punishment of the wrongdoers.
Exile,59,18,"O believers! Keep fearing Allah. And everyone should be vigilant to what he has sent forward for tomorrow (the Day of Reckoning). And always fear Allah. Indeed, Allah is Well Aware of what you do."
Exile,59,19,And be not like those who forgot Allah. So Allah made them forget their own souls (that they could send forward some good for their own souls). It is they who are defiant.
Exile,59,20,The inmates of Hell and the people of Paradise cannot be equal. It is the people of Paradise who are successful and victorious.
Exile,59,21,"Had We sent down this Qur’an on some mountain, then, (O listener,) you would certainly have seen it bowed, split and crushed to pieces for fear of Allah. And We give these examples for the people so that they may ponder."
Exile,59,22,"Allah is He besides Whom there is no God: the Knower of the unseen and the seen. He alone is Most Kind, Ever-Merciful."
Exile,59,23,"Allah is He apart from Whom there is no God: (the Real) King, the Most Pure of all shortcomings, Perfectly Free from all imperfections (and the Bestower of Peace), the Giver of security and protection (and the Attester of the Messengers by means of Miracles), the Guardian and Watchful, the Almighty and the Lord of Honour, the Lord of Great Majesty, the Supreme Authority and the Supremely Great. Glory be to Allah, far above all that they associate with Him."
Exile,59,24,"Allah is He Who is the Creator, the One Who brings into existence from nothingness (i.e., the Inventor), the Bestower of Form; (in short) all Beautiful Names belong to Him alone. All that is in the heavens and the earth glorifies Him, the Lord of Honour, the Most Wise."
She That is to be Examined,60,1,"O believers! Do not make friends with My enemies and your enemies. You communicate to them information because of (your) friendship, whereas they just deny the very truth that has come to you. They drive out the Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) and you (from your land) because you believe in Allah, your Sustainer. If you have set out to fight in My way and seek My pleasure (then do not have friendship with them). You send them secret messages of friendship whilst I know best what you hide and what you make known. And whoever of you does this (misdeed) has deviated from the straight path."
She That is to be Examined,60,2,"Should they get the better of you, then (you will see that) they will be your open enemies. And they will extend their hands and tongues to you with evil design and will have the earnest desire that you disbelieve (somehow)."
She That is to be Examined,60,3,Neither your (disbelieving and polytheist) kindred nor your (disbelieving and polytheist) children will be of any good to you on the Day of Resurrection. (On that Day Allah will) bring about complete separation between you (the believers will be sent to Paradise and the disbelievers to Hell). And Allah observes your doings well.
She That is to be Examined,60,4,"Indeed, in Ibrahim (Abraham) and his companions there is an excellent example for you (to follow), when they said to their people: ‘We are utterly weary of (and cut off from) you and the idols that you worship apart from Allah; we have openly rejected you all. The enmity, hatred and malice between us and you have become evident forever until you believe in Allah, the One.’ But Ibrahim’s (Abraham’s) saying to his (foster) father: ‘I shall certainly pray for your forgiveness,’ (was just a promise made to him well before, which he fulfilled and gave him a reminder as well saying:) ‘I do not possess anything for you before Allah (owing to your disbelief and idol-worship.’ Then he separated from his people, praying:) ‘O our Lord, we put our trust in You alone, and we turn in repentance to You alone, and (all) have to return to You alone."
She That is to be Examined,60,5,"O our Lord! Make us not a source of trial for the disbelievers (i.e., give them not control over us) and forgive us. O our Lord, surely You alone are the Almighty, the Lord of Honour, the Most Wise.’"
She That is to be Examined,60,6,"Indeed, there is for you an excellent example in them (to follow), for him (in particular) who hopes (to appear before the presence of) Allah and looks forward to the Last Day. But whoever turns away, then Allah is Self-Sufficient and Praiseworthy."
She That is to be Examined,60,7,"It may be that Allah brings about friendship (at a later stage) between you and those of them who are now your foes. And Allah is All-Powerful and Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful."
She That is to be Examined,60,8,"Allah does not forbid you to be good to them and treat them with equity and justice who did not fight against you on (the question of) Din (Religion), nor did they drive you out of your homes (i.e., homeland). Surely, Allah likes those who conduct themselves with equity and justice."
She That is to be Examined,60,9,"Allah only forbids you to befriend those who fought against you on (account of) the Din (Religion) and drove you out of your homes (i.e., homeland) and aided (your enemies) in expelling you. And whoever makes friends with them, it is they who are the wrongdoers."
She That is to be Examined,60,10,"O believers! When the believing women come to you as Emigrants, examine them thoroughly. Allah is Well Aware of (the reality of) their faith. Then if you find with certitude that they are true believers, do not send them back to the disbelievers. Neither are they (the believing women) lawful for those disbelievers, nor are those disbelievers lawful for these (believing women). And pay them (the disbelievers) back the money which they spent (on them as dower). And there is no sin on you if you marry them whilst you pay these (women) their dower. And, O believers, do not hold back the disbelieving women in (your) wedlock, and ask (the disbelievers) for that (money) which you spent (on those women as dower), and they (the disbelievers) may also ask you for that (money) which they spent (on these women as dower). That is the command of Allah. And He judges between you. And Allah is All-Knowing, Most Wise."
She That is to be Examined,60,11,"And if any of your wives deserts you and goes over to the disbelievers, then (when) you become dominant in war and gain spoils, pay (out of it) those whose wives deserted them as much (money) as they paid (to them as dower). And keep fearing Allah in Whom you believe."
She That is to be Examined,60,12,"O Prophet! When the believing women appear in your presence to take the oath of allegiance that they will not set up anything as partner with Allah and will not steal, nor will they commit adultery, or kill their children, or bring false blame which they have invented between their hands and feet (i.e., will not deceive their husbands declaring some other’s baby as their own), or disobey you in (any) matter pertaining to law, then accept their allegiance and seek forgiveness for them from Allah. Surely, Allah is Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful."
She That is to be Examined,60,13,"O believers! Do not make friends with those on whom Allah has sent His wrath. Surely, they have despaired of the Hereafter as the disbelievers have despaired of those in graves."
The Ranks,61,1,"Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth (all) glorify Allah. And He is the Lord of Honour and Dominance, Most Wise."
The Ranks,61,2,O believers! Why do you say what you do not do?
The Ranks,61,3,It is most hateful in the sight of Allah that you should say what you do not do.
The Ranks,61,4,"Assuredly, Allah loves those who fight in the way of Allah (to eliminate tyranny and terrorism and restore peace and human dignity, so) organized in ranks as if they were a wall cemented with molten lead."
The Ranks,61,5,"And, (O Beloved, recall) when Musa (Moses) said to his people: ‘O my people, why do you offend me whilst you know that I am (a Messenger) sent to you by Allah?’ So when they continued deviating, then Allah made their hearts deviate. And Allah does not guide the defiant."
The Ranks,61,6,"(And also recall) when ‘Isa, the son of Maryam (Jesus, the son of Mary) said: ‘O Children of Israel, indeed I am (a Messenger) sent to you by Allah, confirming the Torah, the Book which came before me, and bearing the good news of (the pleasant arrival) of (the Esteemed) Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) who will come after me, whose name is Ahmad (now in the heavens).’ But when he (the Last of the Messengers) came to them with clear signs, they said: ‘This is open magic.’"
The Ranks,61,7,And who can be a greater wrongdoer than he who invents a lie against Allah whilst he is being invited towards Islam? And Allah does not guide the wrongdoers.
The Ranks,61,8,"These (deniers of the truth) desire to put out the Light of Allah by (blowing) with their mouths, whereas Allah will take His Light to perfection, even though the disbelievers may dislike it intensely."
The Ranks,61,9,"He is the One Who has sent His Messenger with guidance and the Din (Religion) of truth so that He may make it dominate and prevail over all other religions, even though the idolaters may hate it much."
The Ranks,61,10,O believers! Shall I advise you a trade which will save you from a painful torment?
The Ranks,61,11,(It is that) you have (perfect) belief in Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) and strive hard for the cause of Allah with your human and material resources. That is better for you if you know.
The Ranks,61,12,"He will forgive your sins and will admit you into Gardens with streams flowing under them, and (will make you reside) in excellent dwellings in the Gardens of Eden (i.e., Gardens of Eternity). That is indeed a great success."
The Ranks,61,13,"And, (besides this favour in the Hereafter, He will grant you) another (worldly blessing too) which you earnestly desire: (that is) help from Allah and a near victory, and, (O Esteemed Prophet,) give this good news to the believers. (This came about in the form of Meccan Victory and the conquests in Persia and Rome.)"
The Ranks,61,14,"O believers! Be helpers of Allah as ‘Isa, the son of Maryam (Jesus, the son of Mary) said to (his) disciples: ‘Who are my helpers towards (the path of) Allah?’ The disciples said: ‘We are Allah’s helpers.’ So a party of the Children of Israel believed and a party disbelieved. So We helped the believers against their enemies and they gained the upper hand."
The Congregation,62,1,"(Everything) in the heavens and in the earth glorifies Allah, (the Real) King, the Most Pure (of all shortcomings and imperfections), the Lord of Honour, the Almighty, the Most Wise."
The Congregation,62,2,"He is the One Who sent a (Glorious) Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) amongst the illiterate people from amongst themselves who recites to them His Revelations and cleanses and purifies them (outwardly and inwardly) and teaches them the Book and wisdom. Indeed, they were in open error before (his most welcome arrival)."
The Congregation,62,3,"And (He has sent this Messenger for purification and education amongst) others of them also who have not yet joined these people (that are present now i.e., they will come after them in later eras). And He is Almighty, Most Wise."
The Congregation,62,4,This (arrival of the Holy Messenger [blessings and peace be upon him] as well as his spiritual benevolence) is Allah’s bounty which He grants whom He likes. And Allah is Most Bountiful.
The Congregation,62,5,"The case of those who were burdened with (the commandments and teachings of) the Torah (but) then did not bear it (i.e., this Messenger was mentioned in it, but they disbelieved in him) is like that of a donkey loaded with heavy books on its back. How evil is the example of those who have rejected Allah’s Revelations! And Allah does not guide the wrongdoers."
The Congregation,62,6,"Say: ‘O Jews, if you think that, leaving all other people, you alone are the friends of Allah (i.e., Awliya’), then long for death (because His Awliya’ will not fear in the grave and the Hereafter) if you are true (in your thinking).’"
The Congregation,62,7,And these people will never long for it due to (the rejection of the Messenger and disbelief) which they have sent forward. And Allah knows the wrongdoers well.
The Congregation,62,8,Say: ‘The death from which you are fleeing is bound to catch up with you. Then you will be returned to Him (the Lord) Who knows the unseen and the seen. So He will inform you of what you used to do.’
The Congregation,62,9,"O believers! When on Fridays the call is made for (Jumu‘a) Prayer, hasten towards the remembrance of Allah (i.e., the Jumu‘a sermon and Prayer) immediately and abandon purchase and sale (i.e., business). That is better for you if you have knowledge."
The Congregation,62,10,"Then after the Prayer is offered, disperse in the land and (then) look for Allah’s bounty (i.e., sustenance). And remember Allah much so that you may attain to prosperity."
The Congregation,62,11,"And when they found some business or entertainment opportunity, they rushed towards that (due to their neediness and financial constraint) and left you standing (during the sermon). Say: ‘Whatever is with Allah is better than sport and business. And Allah is the Best of sustainers.’"
The Hypocrites,63,1,"(O Esteemed Beloved!) When the hypocrites come to you, they say: ‘We bear witness that you are certainly the Messenger of Allah.’ And Allah knows that surely you are His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him). But Allah bears witness that undoubtedly the hypocrites are liars."
The Hypocrites,63,2,"They have made their oaths a shield. Then they hinder (the people) from the path of Allah. Surely, that is an extremely evil (work) which they are doing."
The Hypocrites,63,3,That is because they believed (with their tongues) but remained disbelievers (at heart). So their hearts have been sealed. And they do not understand (anything).
The Hypocrites,63,4,"(O servant!) When you see them, their bodies (and height and structure) seem attractive to you, and if they speak, you lend ear to what they say (i.e., they will look sensible to you, but the fact is that) they are nothing but wooden planks propped up against a supporting wall. They take every loud voice (as some suffering and misery) befallen them. It is these (hypocrites) who are (your) enemies. So be on guard against them. May Allah ruin them; where are they wandering distracted!"
The Hypocrites,63,5,"And when it is said to them: ‘Come so that Allah’s Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) may seek forgiveness for you,’ these (hypocrites) jerk their heads aside (insolently) and you see them keeping away (from your presence) in arrogance.*"
The Hypocrites,63,6,"It is all the same for these (evil-fated denigrators of the Holy Prophet [blessings and peace be upon him]) whether you seek for them forgiveness or do not seek for them forgiveness, Allah will never forgive them (because they mock you and show you dislike and arrogance). Surely, Allah does not provide guidance to the disobedient community."
The Hypocrites,63,7,"(O Esteemed Beloved!) They are the people who say this as well (out of malice and enmity against you): ‘Do not spend on those (destitute devotees of Allah) who remain in the presence of the Messenger of Allah (i.e., do not provide them financial help) until they (all may desert him and) flee away (and disperse). In truth, to Allah belong all the treasures of the heavens and the earth, but the hypocrites do not understand."
The Hypocrites,63,8,"They say: ‘If (now) we return to Medina, then (we) the honourable will drive out the dishonourable (i.e., the Muslims).’ But in fact, honour belongs to Allah alone and His Messenger and the believers. However, the hypocrites do not understand (this reality)."
The Hypocrites,63,9,"O believers! Let not your wealth and your children make you neglectful of the very remembrance of Allah. And whoever does so, it is they who are the losers."
The Hypocrites,63,10,"And spend (in the way of Allah) out of (the wealth) which We have given you before death approaches one of you, and he says: ‘O my Lord, why did You not give me respite for a short while so that I could donate in charity and become one of the most pious?’"
The Hypocrites,63,11,And Allah never grants respite to anyone when his hour of death approaches. And Allah is Well Aware of the actions that you do.
Mutual Disillusion,64,1,Everything in the heavens and in the earth glorifies Allah. His is the entire kingdom and His is all the praise. And He is All-Powerful over everything.
Mutual Disillusion,64,2,"He is the One Who created you. Then (some one) of you became a disbeliever and (the other one) of you became a believer, and Allah sees best the actions that you do."
Mutual Disillusion,64,3,He is the One Who created the heavens and the earth with a rationale and purpose. And (He is the One Who) gave you shapes and then did up your shapes. And (all) have to return to Him alone.
Mutual Disillusion,64,4,"He knows what is in the heavens and in the earth and (also) knows those things that you hide and that you disclose, and Allah knows best (the secret) matters contained in the breasts."
Mutual Disillusion,64,5,"Has the news not reached you of those who disbelieved before you and tasted the punishment of their work (in the world), and there is a grievous torment for them (in the Hereafter as well)?"
Mutual Disillusion,64,6,"That is because their Messengers brought them clear signs, but they said: ‘Shall a human being (who is our like and from our kind) guide us?’* So they became disbelievers and turned away (from the truth). And Allah too disregarded (them) and Allah is Self-Sufficient, Praiseworthy."
Mutual Disillusion,64,7,The disbelievers think that they will never be raised (again). Say: ‘Why not! By my Lord! You will surely be raised. Then you will be informed of what you did. And this is very easy for Allah (to do).’
Mutual Disillusion,64,8,So believe in Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) and that Light which We have sent down. And Allah is Well Aware of the deeds that you do.
Mutual Disillusion,64,9,"The Day when He will gather you on the Day of Assembly (in the vast expanse for Great Gathering), that will be the Day of Manifestation of Loss and Defeat. And he who believes in Allah and does pious deeds, Allah will remove his sins from his (record of deeds) and will admit him to the Gardens with streams flowing under them. They will live in them forever. This is a great success."
Mutual Disillusion,64,10,"And those who disbelieve and reject Our Revelations, it is they who are the inmates of Hell, its permanent residents. And what an evil abode that is!"
Mutual Disillusion,64,11,"No suffering afflicts (anyone) except by the command of Allah. And he who believes in Allah, He guides his heart and Allah knows best everything."
Mutual Disillusion,64,12,"And obey Allah and obey the Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him). Then if you turn away, (remember that) the responsibility of Our Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) is only to deliver (the injunctions) clearly."
Mutual Disillusion,64,13,Allah (alone) is (God). There is no God but He. And the believers should put their trust in Allah alone.
Mutual Disillusion,64,14,"O believers! Surely, amongst your wives and your children there are some who are your enemies. So, beware of them! And if you overlook it and forbear and forgive, Allah is indeed Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful."
Mutual Disillusion,64,15,Your riches and your children are merely a trial. And there is a mighty reward in the presence of Allah.
Mutual Disillusion,64,16,"So fear Allah as much as you are able to. And listen to (His commands) and obey and spend (in His way). That will be better for you. And whoever is saved from the miserliness of his (ill-commanding) self, it is they who will attain prosperity."
Mutual Disillusion,64,17,"If you lend a good loan to Allah (with sincerity and righteous intention), He will increase it manifold for you and will forgive you. And Allah is Most Appreciative, Most Forbearing,"
Mutual Disillusion,64,18,"The Knower of the unseen and the seen, the Lord of Honour and Almighty and Most Wise."
Divorce,65,1,"O Prophet! (Say to the Muslims:) ‘When you seek to divorce your women, divorce them during their period of purity and count their prescribed period. And keep fearing Allah, Who is your Lord. And do not drive them out of their homes, nor should they leave unless they commit open indecency. And these are Allah’s (fixed) limits. And whoever transgresses Allah’s limits has surely wronged his own soul. (O man,) you do not know that Allah may perhaps develop a new situation (to turn you back to her after divorce)."
Divorce,65,2,"Then when they reach closer to (the end of) their appointed term, retain them with kindness or separate from them with kindness. And take two just persons from amongst you as witnesses and establish testimony for the sake of Allah. This is advice for him alone who believes in Allah and the Last Day. And whoever fears Allah, He makes a way out for him (from pain and grief of this world and the Hereafter),"
Divorce,65,3,"And He gives him sustenance from a source which he can never think of. And whoever puts his trust in Allah, then He (Allah) is Sufficient for him. Surely, Allah accomplishes His work entirely. He has certainly appointed a measure for everything."
Divorce,65,4,"And those of your women who have no hope of menstruation, if you doubt (as to what will be their prescribed period), then their prescribed period is three months. And for those women who have not yet menstruated (their prescribed period is also the same). As for the pregnant women, their term is till the birth of the child. And whoever fears Allah, He makes his matter easy for him."
Divorce,65,5,"This is the command of Allah which He has sent down to you. And whoever fears Allah, He removes his minor sins from his (record of deeds) and enhances reward for him."
Divorce,65,6,"Keep the (divorced) women where you live according to your means. And do not harm them so as to make (the place of living) intolerable for them. And if they are pregnant, keep spending on them till they give birth to the child. Then if they suckle (the child) for your sake, pay them their recompense. And consult each other (as usual) for good. But if you experience difficulty mutually, (then some) other woman may suckle the child."
Divorce,65,7,"The affluent one should spend (according to) his means. And whoever is provided sustenance scarcely, let him spend (on her maintenance) out of the provision which Allah has given him. Allah does not burden anyone beyond what He has given him. Allah will soon bring about ease after hardship."
Divorce,65,8,"And how many towns there were (the inhabitants of) which disobeyed and revolted against the command of their Lord and His Messengers! So We called them to account in the shape of fierce accountability, and seized them with such a severe torment as was never seen or even heard of."
Divorce,65,9,So they tasted the evil consequence of their doings and their affair ended up in total loss.
Divorce,65,10,"Allah has prepared for them severe torment (in the Hereafter as well). So keep fearing Allah, O men of reason, you who have believed. No doubt it is you towards whom Allah has sent down the Reminder (the Qur’an),"
Divorce,65,11,"(And has also sent) the Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him), who recites to you clear Verses so that he may take those who have believed and do pious deeds from darkness to light. And he who believes in Allah and does pious deeds, He will admit him to the Gardens with streams flowing under them. They will live in them forever. Indeed, Allah has (prepared) for him excellent sustenance."
Divorce,65,12,"Allah (alone) has created seven heavens and (brought about seven strata layer upon layer also whilst creating) the earth like them. And the command (i.e., phenomenon of coordination in the system of nature) continues to operate amongst them so that you may know that Allah has absolute power over everything, and that Allah has encompassed everything with His Knowledge (i.e., when scientific explorations will culminate, you will then perceive the glory of Allah’s power and His All-Encompassing knowledge as to how He has described the realities of His creation centuries before)."
Banning,66,1,"O (Esteemed) Prophet! Why do you forbid yourself (taking honey) which Allah has made lawful for you? (How well) you seek to please your wives! And Allah is Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful."
Banning,66,2,"(O believers!) Indeed, Allah has prescribed for you how to dissolve your oaths (by atonement). And Allah is your Helper and Protector. And He is All-Knowing, Most Wise."
Banning,66,3,"And when the Prophet (blessings and peace be upon him) secretly disclosed a matter to one of his wives, but when she mentioned it and Allah made it known to the Prophet (blessings and peace be upon him), then the Prophet reminded her of some part of it and overlooked (to inform) the rest of it. Then when the Prophet (blessings and peace be upon him) informed her of it (that she had disclosed that secret), she said: ‘Who has told you of that?’ The Prophet (blessings and peace be upon him) said: ‘The All-Knowing, All-Aware (Lord) has told me.’"
Banning,66,4,"If you both turn to Allah in repentance, (that is better for you) because the hearts of both of you have inclined (towards the same), but if you help one another in this matter (that may annoy the Holy Prophet [blessings and peace be upon him]). So surely Allah is the One Who is his Friend and Helper and Jibril (Gabriel) and the most pious believers and after them (all) angels too are (his) helpers."
Banning,66,5,"If he divorces you, then it may well be that your Lord will give him in your place better wives than yourselves (who) will be obedient, true believers, submissive, penitent, worshippers, given to fasting, (some) formerly married and (some) virgins."
Banning,66,6,O believers! Safeguard yourselves and your families against a Fire whose fuel is men and stones. Appointed over it are strong and stern angels who do not disobey Allah in what He commands them. And they accomplish what they are ordered.
Banning,66,7,O disbelievers! Do not make any excuse Today. You will only be paid the reward of what you have been doing.
Banning,66,8,"O believers! Turn towards Allah’s presence in perfect and most sincere repentance. Your Lord will certainly remove your sins from you, and admit you to the Gardens with streams flowing under them. On the Day when Allah will not slight (His) Prophet (blessings and peace be upon him) and those believers who are in his companionship (visibly or invisibly), their light will be moving fast (brightening) ahead of them and on their right side. They will be submitting: ‘O our Lord, perfect our light for us and forgive us. Surely, You have absolute power over everything.’"
Banning,66,9,"O (Esteemed) Prophet! Strive hard against the disbelievers and the hypocrites (who have initiated militancy, aggression, mischief and intrigues against you) and treat them strictly. And their abode is Hell. And what an evil abode that is!"
Banning,66,10,"Allah has described for disbelievers the example of Nuh’s (Noah’s) wife (Wahila) and Lut’s (Lot’s) wife (Wa‘ila). They were married to two of Our pious servants. But both of them betrayed them. So they could not help them before (the torment of) Allah, and it was said to them: ‘Both of you (women), enter Hell along with all who enter it.’"
Banning,66,11,"And Allah has given for the believers the example of Pharaoh’s wife (Asiya, the daughter of Mazahim) when she submitted: ‘O my Lord, build a house for me in Paradise in Your presence, and deliver me from Pharaoh and his (evil) conduct, and also rescue me from the wrongdoing people.’"
Banning,66,12,"And (the second example is given of) Maryam (Mary), the daughter of ‘Imran, who guarded well her chastity and purity. And We breathed Our Spirit into the sternal opening of (her) shirt. And she confirmed the commandments of her Lord and the (revealed) Books and she was of the obedient."
The Sovereignty,67,1,Blessed is He in Whose (Mighty) Hand is the kingdom (of all the worlds). And He enjoys perfect command over everything;
The Sovereignty,67,2,"He Who has created death and life (so that) He may test you as to which of you is best in conduct. And He is Almighty, Most Forgiving;"
The Sovereignty,67,3,"He Who has created seven (or numerous) heavenly spheres corresponding to one another (layer upon layer). You will not find any irregularity and disproportion in the system of the creation of the Most Kind (Lord). So have a (meditative and thoughtful) look around: do you find in this (creation) any incongruity or disharmony (i.e., degeneration or falling apart)?"
The Sovereignty,67,4,Look around time and again with (an inquisitive) vision (from different angles and with scientific methods. Every time) your sight will return to you fatigued and frustrated (in finding any shortcoming or imperfection).
The Sovereignty,67,5,"And surely, We have adorned the lowest heaven of the universe with lights (in the form of stars, planets, other asteroids and meteoroids). And We have also made (some of them) the means of pelting away (i.e., eliminating the negative effects of) satans (i.e., rebellious forces). And We have prepared for these (satans) a torment of Blazing Fire."
The Sovereignty,67,6,And for those who have denied their Lord is the torment of Hell. And what an evil abode it is!
The Sovereignty,67,7,"When they will be flung into it, they will hear its horrifying roar. And that (Fire) will be boiling (with rage),"
The Sovereignty,67,8,"As if it is about to burst into pieces with intense wrath. When a group will be cast into it, its guards will ask them: ‘Did no Warner come to you?’"
The Sovereignty,67,9,"They will say: ‘Yes indeed! A Warner did come to us, but we rejected him and said: Allah has not sent down anything. You are just in great error.’"
The Sovereignty,67,10,"And they will say: ‘Had we listened to or understood (the truth), we would not have been (put) amongst the inmates of Hell (Today).’"
The Sovereignty,67,11,Then they will confess their sin. So remoteness for the inmates of Hell (from Allah’s mercy) is (destined).
The Sovereignty,67,12,"Surely, those who fear their Lord unseen, for them is forgiveness and great reward."
The Sovereignty,67,13,"And whether you speak in secret or aloud, certainly He knows best (even) the things (hidden) in the hearts."
The Sovereignty,67,14,"Does He, Who has created, not know? In truth, He is the One Who can see the essence and is Well Aware (of everything)."
The Sovereignty,67,15,"He is the One Who has made the earth soft and subservient to you. So walk about through its tracks and eat of the sustenance (given) by Him, and towards Him alone is the return, rising (after death)."
The Sovereignty,67,16,Have you gone fearless of (the Lord of) the heaven that He may sink you into the earth when it suddenly shakes?
The Sovereignty,67,17,Have you gone fearless of (the Lord of) the heaven that He may send against you a stone-pelting wind? Then soon will you come to know how My Warning is!
The Sovereignty,67,18,"And surely, those before them (also) denied. But how (awful) proved My denial!"
The Sovereignty,67,19,"Have they not seen the birds above them spreading out their wings and (sometimes) folding them? Nothing can hold them (from falling) except (the law made by) the Most Kind (Lord). Surely, He sees everything best."
The Sovereignty,67,20,"Well, is there anyone that can muster an army to help you against the Most Kind Lord? The disbelievers are merely (snared) in deception."
The Sovereignty,67,21,"Well, is there anyone that can provide you sustenance if (Allah) holds back His sustenance (from you)? In fact, they are adamantly fixed in rebellion and hatred (for truth)."
The Sovereignty,67,22,"Is he who walks in prone position more rightly guided, or he who walks upright on a straight path?"
The Sovereignty,67,23,Say: ‘(Allah) is He Who created you and provided you with ears and eyes and hearts. Yet you give thanks but little.’
The Sovereignty,67,24,"Say: ‘He is the One Who has spread you in the earth, and you will be gathered towards Him (on the Day of Assembly).’"
The Sovereignty,67,25,And they say: ‘When will this promise (of the Day of Resurrection) be fulfilled if you are truthful?’
The Sovereignty,67,26,"Say: ‘The knowledge (of that Hour) is with Allah alone and I am just a clear Warner.’ (If the time is disclosed, there will be no fear any more.)"
The Sovereignty,67,27,"Then, when they will see that (Day) near, the faces of the disbelievers will be deformed and darkened, and it will be said (to them): ‘This is (the promise) which you asked for (to come to pass in haste).’"
The Sovereignty,67,28,"Say: ‘Well, give your view: if Allah causes me death (as you desire) and (also) to my Companions, or shows mercy to us (i.e., defers our death), then (in both these cases) who will shelter the disbelievers from the painful torment?’"
The Sovereignty,67,29,Say: ‘He alone is the Most Kind (Lord) in Whom we believe and in Whom we trust. So you will soon know who is in open error.’
The Sovereignty,67,30,"Say: ‘If your water sinks far deep into the earth (i.e., dries up), then who will bring you flowing water (on earth)?’"
The Pen,68,1,Nun. (Only Allah and the Messenger [blessings and peace be upon him] know the real meaning.) By the pen and by that (subject) which (the angels) write down!
The Pen,68,2,"(O Esteemed Beloved!) By the Grace of your Lord, you are not (at all) insane."
The Pen,68,3,"And assuredly, for you there is a reward that will never end."
The Pen,68,4,"And assuredly, you are placed high on the Most Glorious and Exalted (seat of) character (i.e., adorned with the Qur’anic morality and endowed with the character traits of Allah)."
The Pen,68,5,"Soon you will see and they (too) will see,"
The Pen,68,6,As to which of you is mad.
The Pen,68,7,"Surely, your Lord knows him best who has strayed from the straight path and (also) knows best those who are rightly guided."
The Pen,68,8,So do not agree with what the beliers say.
The Pen,68,9,They wish that you should become (needlessly) flexible (in the matter of the Din [Religion]). Then they too would show flexibility.
The Pen,68,10,"And do not agree with any vile, most mean swearer of oaths,"
The Pen,68,11,"(The one who is) a slanderer, fault-finder, mischief-monger, (and) who backbites the people to rouse strife,"
The Pen,68,12,"(The one who) greatly hinders pious works and is a miser, rebellious transgressor (and) toughened sinner,"
The Pen,68,13,"(The one who is) rude, unmannerly, crooked and moreover of doubtful birth.*"
The Pen,68,14,So (do not pay any heed to him) because he is wealthy and has children.
The Pen,68,15,"When Our Verses are recited to him, he says: ‘These are the fictitious stories of the bygone people.’"
The Pen,68,16,Now We shall brand him on the snout.
The Pen,68,17,"Surely, We will try them (the inhabitants of Mecca in the same way) as We tried (in Yemen) the owners of the garden when they swore that they would surely pluck its fruit the next morning."
The Pen,68,18,And they did not make any exception (saying ‘if Allah wills’ or for the share of the orphans).
The Pen,68,19,"So a whirl (of disaster) from your Lord went round (that garden during the night) whilst they were asleep,"
The Pen,68,20,"So, that (waving fruit-laden garden) became a harvested field in the morning."
The Pen,68,21,"Then as the day dawned, they started calling out one another:"
The Pen,68,22,‘Leave early for your tilth if you want to pick the fruit.’
The Pen,68,23,So they set off whispering to one another:
The Pen,68,24,‘Do not let any pauper come near you in the garden today.’
The Pen,68,25,"And early in the morning they left, (feeling) quite competent to execute their plan (of getting the yield and depriving the poor of their share)."
The Pen,68,26,"Then when they saw that (ruined garden), they said: ‘We must have lost our way; (this is not our garden).’"
The Pen,68,27,"(But when they saw it cautiously, they cried: ‘Oh no!) We have been deprived indeed.’"
The Pen,68,28,"One of them, wise and inclined to the balanced judgment, said: ‘Did I not say to you: Why do you not glorify and remember Allah?’"
The Pen,68,29,"(Then) they said: ‘Our Lord is Holy. Surely, it is we who were the wrongdoers.’"
The Pen,68,30,"So, blaming and maligning, they turned to one another."
The Pen,68,31,They said: ‘Woe to us! No doubt it is we who were disobedient and rebellious.
The Pen,68,32,"We hope that our Lord may give us something better than this in exchange. Verily, we turn to our Lord.’"
The Pen,68,33,"Such is the punishment. And truly, the torment of the Hereafter is far greater (than this). Would that they only knew!"
The Pen,68,34,"Surely, for the Godfearing there are Gardens of Bliss with their Lord."
The Pen,68,35,Shall We (deprive) the obedient like the disobedient?
The Pen,68,36,What is the matter with you? How do you make a judgment?
The Pen,68,37,"Do you have any Book with you in which you read (this),"
The Pen,68,38,That it contains all that you like?
The Pen,68,39,Or have you any (such) firm covenants from Us as will subsist till the Day of Resurrection (by means of which We are bound) that you will be provided with whatever you shall decide (for yourselves)?
The Pen,68,40,Ask them which of them will vouch for such (a baseless assertion)!
The Pen,68,41,Or do they have any partners (as well)? Then they should bring their partners if they are truthful.
The Pen,68,42,"The Day when the ‘shin’ (i.e., the terrifying fierceness of the Hour of Rising) will be laid bare, and (the disobedient) people will be called to prostrate themselves, but they will not be able to do so (i.e., to prostrate themselves)."
The Pen,68,43,"Their eyes will be cast down (with terror and shame) and disgrace will be spreading over them, whereas they were called to prostrate themselves (in the world also) when they were healthy (but they, even then, refused to fall prostrate)."
The Pen,68,44,"So, (O Esteemed Beloved,) leave Me (to exact revenge) from the one who rejects this Revelation. Now We shall take them (towards disaster) so gradually that they will not perceive it."
The Pen,68,45,"And I am giving them respite. Surely, My strategy is unbeatable."
The Pen,68,46,Do you ask them for any reward (for preaching the faith in Messengership) that they are weighed down with (the burden of) paying the recompense?
The Pen,68,47,Do they have the knowledge of the unseen that they write down (their judgments on the basis of that)?
The Pen,68,48,"So be steadfast in waiting for the command of your Lord, and do not (take it to your heart) like (Yunus [Jonah], the Messenger with) fish episode, when he cried out (to Allah) in a state pent up with rage and grief (against his community)."
The Pen,68,49,"Had the mercy and blessing of his Lord not helped him, he would certainly have been thrown in the barren field, blamed. (But Allah saved him from that.)"
The Pen,68,50,Then his Lord exalted him and (placed him) amongst the perfectly pious (blessing him with His exceptional nearness).
The Pen,68,51,"And indeed, when the disbelievers listen to the Qur’an, it seems as if they wish to damage you with their (jealously evil) looks and say: ‘He is insane.’"
The Pen,68,52,And it (the Qur’an) is direction and guidance for all the worlds.
The Reality,69,1,The surely Inevitable Hour!
The Reality,69,2,What is the surely Inevitable Hour?
The Reality,69,3,And what has made you alert what (calamity) surely is the Inevitable Hour?
The Reality,69,4,Thamud and ‘Ad rejected the (calamity of a) Shattering Gravitational Collision (of all the existent cosmic bodies).
The Reality,69,5,"So, as for the people of Thamud, they were destroyed by the extremely violent, Deafening Blast."
The Reality,69,6,"And as for the people of ‘Ad, they (too) were destroyed by a violently cold, roaring gale."
The Reality,69,7,"Allah made that (gale) seize them for consecutive seven nights and eight days. So, you could see them lying dead (during that time as if) they were hollow roots of the uprooted palm trees."
The Reality,69,8,So do you see any of them surviving?
The Reality,69,9,And Pharaoh and those before him and (the dwellers of) the overthrown towns (of the community of Lut [Lot]) committed grave sins.
The Reality,69,10,So they (also) disobeyed the Messenger of their Lord. And Allah seized them with a mighty seizure.
The Reality,69,11,"Indeed, when the water (of the Deluge) overflowed the limit, We carried you in the floating Ark,"
The Reality,69,12,So that We make this (episode a reminding) lesson of warning for you and that the retentive ears may retain it.
The Reality,69,13,"Then when the Trumpet will be blown once,"
The Reality,69,14,"And the earth and mountains will be removed (from their places), they will then be crushed to sand particles in a single crash."
The Reality,69,15,Then that will be the Hour when the surely Inevitable (calamity) will occur.
The Reality,69,16,And (all) the heavenly bodies will split apart and this universe will come to comprise (black) holes (by means of a force which coordinates and keeps the system going).*
The Reality,69,17,"And the angels will be standing on its edges and above them that Day, and eight (angels or parties of angels) will be carrying the Throne of your Lord."
The Reality,69,18,That Day you will be made to appear (for reckoning). Nothing of your secrets will remain hidden.
The Reality,69,19,So the one who will be given his record in the right hand will say (pleased): ‘Come and read my record.
The Reality,69,20,I firmly believed that I would find my account (easy).’
The Reality,69,21,"So he will live a pleasant life,"
The Reality,69,22,"In an elevated lofty Paradise,"
The Reality,69,23,The clusters of its fruits hanging low (due to abundance).
The Reality,69,24,"(It will be said to them:) ‘Eat and drink rejoicing, in recompense of (your deeds) that you had sent forward during the days of your past (life).’"
The Reality,69,25,"And as for him who will be given his record in his left hand, he will say: ‘Would that I had not been given my record!"
The Reality,69,26,And would that I had not known about my account!
The Reality,69,27,Alas! Would that (death) had settled my affair once and for all!
The Reality,69,28,Today my wealth has not been able to keep (the torment) away from me even a little.
The Reality,69,29,My power and domain have (also) gone from me.’
The Reality,69,30,(It will be commanded:) ‘Seize him and put him in neck-fetter.
The Reality,69,31,Then cast him into Hell.
The Reality,69,32,Then bind him tightly in a seventy yard long chain.
The Reality,69,33,"Verily, he did not believe in Allah, the Lord of Majesty."
The Reality,69,34,Nor did he urge the feeding of the poor.
The Reality,69,35,So Today he does not have any warm friend.
The Reality,69,36,"Nor has he anything to eat except filthy pus,"
The Reality,69,37,That no one will eat except the sinners.’
The Reality,69,38,"So I swear by the things that you see,"
The Reality,69,39,And by those things that you do not see.
The Reality,69,40,"Assuredly, this (Qur’an) is the (God-sent) commandment of the Exalted and Glorious Messenger ([blessings and peace be upon him] which he expounds as a Messenger and as a Vicegerent)."
The Reality,69,41,And it is not the poetry of a poet (composed with literary expertise). You have but little faith.
The Reality,69,42,Nor is it the word of a fortune-teller (designed by skilful guesswork). You take but little advice.
The Reality,69,43,(This) is sent down by the Lord of all the worlds.
The Reality,69,44,"And had he ascribed to Us even a (single) fabricated thing,"
The Reality,69,45,"We would have seized him with full force and might,"
The Reality,69,46,"Then certainly We would have cut his life artery,"
The Reality,69,47,Then no one of you could have held (Us) back from it.
The Reality,69,48,So no doubt this (Qur’an) is direction and guidance for the Godfearing.
The Reality,69,49,"And surely, We know that some of you are the beliers (of this open truth)."
The Reality,69,50,"And surely, this is (a cause of) bitter regret for the disbelievers."
The Reality,69,51,"And undeniably, it is the truth of Absolute Certitude."
The Reality,69,52,"So, (O Esteemed Beloved,) glorify your Lord, Most Magnificent, with persistence."
The Ascending Stairways,70,1,"A questioner asked for the torment which is sure to come about,"
The Ascending Stairways,70,2,"Upon the disbelievers, which no one can repel."
The Ascending Stairways,70,3,"(That will befall) from Allah, Who is the Lord of the Ascending Steps to Heaven (and of the higher ranks and grades of spiritual hierarchy)."
The Ascending Stairways,70,4,The angels and al-Ruh al-Amin (the Spirit) rise towards His (Throne) in a Day which measures fifty thousand years (according to the worldly scale).*
The Ascending Stairways,70,5,"So, (O Beloved,) observe patience (on the assertions of the disbelievers) without regrets."
The Ascending Stairways,70,6,"Surely, they imagine that (Day) to be far off,"
The Ascending Stairways,70,7,But We see it very near.
The Ascending Stairways,70,8,"On that Day the sky will become like molten copper,"
The Ascending Stairways,70,9,"And the mountains like (flakes of) coloured wool,"
The Ascending Stairways,70,10,"And no friend will enquire after his friend,"
The Ascending Stairways,70,11,"(Though) they will be shown (to one another). The sinner would desire to ransom himself from the torment of that Day by his children,"
The Ascending Stairways,70,12,"And (by giving) his wife and his brother,"
The Ascending Stairways,70,13,"And (all) his family who used to provide him shelter,"
The Ascending Stairways,70,14,"And all the people on earth (as recompense for himself), so that this (atonement) may save him from (Allah’s torment)."
The Ascending Stairways,70,15,"But no! By no means! Surely, that is a Flaming Fire,"
The Ascending Stairways,70,16,Stripping off the skin of all the limbs and the scalp.
The Ascending Stairways,70,17,"It is calling him who turned his back (on the truth) and turned away,"
The Ascending Stairways,70,18,And (he who) accumulated wealth and then held it (from distribution).
The Ascending Stairways,70,19,"Surely, man has been created impatient and greedy."
The Ascending Stairways,70,20,"He gets upset and worried when some hardship (or financial loss) afflicts him,"
The Ascending Stairways,70,21,"But becomes miserly when he receives good fortune (or affluence),"
The Ascending Stairways,70,22,"Except for those who offer Prayer,"
The Ascending Stairways,70,23,"And are constant in their Prayer,"
The Ascending Stairways,70,24,"And those (who are committed to sacrifice and) in whose wealth there is a fixed share,"
The Ascending Stairways,70,25,"Of one who begs and of one who is needy but does not beg,"
The Ascending Stairways,70,26,"And those who affirm the Day of Requital,"
The Ascending Stairways,70,27,And those who fear the torment of their Lord;
The Ascending Stairways,70,28,"Surely, the torment of their Lord is not a thing which should not be feared;"
The Ascending Stairways,70,29,"And those who safeguard their private parts,"
The Ascending Stairways,70,30,Except from their wives or the female slaves they possess. So (in this) there is no blame on them.
The Ascending Stairways,70,31,"But he who looks for more than that, then it is they who transgress the limits."
The Ascending Stairways,70,32,"And those who safeguard their trusts and promises,"
The Ascending Stairways,70,33,"And those who stand firm on their testimonies,"
The Ascending Stairways,70,34,"And those who safeguard their Prayers,"
The Ascending Stairways,70,35,It is they who will enjoy great honour and respect in the Gardens.
The Ascending Stairways,70,36,"So what is the matter with the disbelievers that they are coming towards you running,"
The Ascending Stairways,70,37,"From the right as well as the left, in groups?"
The Ascending Stairways,70,38,Does every one of them hope that he may be admitted to the Garden of Bliss (without faith and deeds)?
The Ascending Stairways,70,39,"Certainly not! Surely, We have created them from a substance which they (also) know."
The Ascending Stairways,70,40,"So I swear by the Lord of the easts and the wests that surely We have Absolute Power,"
The Ascending Stairways,70,41,To replace them with people better than them and We are not at all incapable (of doing it).
The Ascending Stairways,70,42,So leave them occupied with their absurd talk and pastime until they meet that Day of theirs which they have been promised.
The Ascending Stairways,70,43,The Day when they will come forth from their graves in haste as if they are running towards the temples of their idols.
The Ascending Stairways,70,44,(Their plight) will be that their eyes will be cast down (with shame and fear) and disgrace enveloping them. It is this Day which they were promised.
Noah,71,1,"Surely, We sent Nuh (Noah) to his people: ‘Warn your people before a painful torment comes upon them.’"
Noah,71,2,"He said: ‘O my people! Indeed, I am a clear Warner to you,"
Noah,71,3,That you must worship Allah and fear Him and obey me.
Noah,71,4,"He will forgive your sins and will give you respite till an appointed term. Surely, when (the appointed) time of Allah comes, then respite is not given if only you knew.’"
Noah,71,5,"Nuh (Noah) submitted: ‘O my Lord! Indeed, I kept calling my people night and day,"
Noah,71,6,But my calling did no good except making them flee away.
Noah,71,7,"And every time I called them (towards faith) so that You might forgive them, they only thrust their fingers into their ears and wrapped their clothes over themselves and stuck obstinately (to disbelief) and behaved most arrogantly."
Noah,71,8,Then I called them aloud.
Noah,71,9,Then I advised them publicly and privately and secretly (as well).
Noah,71,10,"Then I said: ‘Seek forgiveness from your Lord. Surely, He is Most Forgiving."
Noah,71,11,"He will send down on you torrents of rain,"
Noah,71,12,And will help you with wealth and sons and will grow for you gardens and will make streams flow for you.
Noah,71,13,"What is the matter with you that you do not have faith in, or the gnosis of, Allah’s Majesty,"
Noah,71,14,Whereas He has created you through diverse conditions?
Noah,71,15,Have you not seen how Allah has created seven (or many) heavenly spheres corresponding to one another (layer upon layer)?
Noah,71,16,"And He brightened in them the moon and made the sun a radiant lamp (i.e., the source of light and heat)."
Noah,71,17,And Allah has caused you to grow like vegetation from the earth.*
Noah,71,18,Then He will return you into the same (earth) and will then bring you forth (from the same again).
Noah,71,19,"And Allah has made the earth a vast expanse for you,"
Noah,71,20,So that you may move around through its broad ways.’
Noah,71,21,Nuh (Noah) submitted: ‘O my Lord! They have disobeyed me and kept following that (class of the rebellious rich) whose wealth and children have not increased for them anything but loss.
Noah,71,22,And they kept perpetrating huge frauds (to keep the common man in error).
Noah,71,23,"And they kept saying: Do not turn away from your gods and never abandon (the idols named as) Wadd, Suwa‘, Yaghuth, Ya‘uq and Nasr (as well)."
Noah,71,24,"And truly, they have misled many people. So, (O my Lord,) do not increase these wrongdoers (in anything) except misguidance.’"
Noah,71,25,(In the end) they were drowned due to their sins and then flung into Fire. So they could not find any helper for themselves against Allah.
Noah,71,26,And Nuh (Noah) submitted: ‘O my Lord! Do not leave even a single disbeliever living on earth.
Noah,71,27,"Surely, if You leave them (alive), they will keep leading your servants astray and will beget none but the most wicked and extremely disbelieving children."
Noah,71,28,"O my Lord! Forgive me and my parents and everyone who enters my home as a believer and (all) the believing men and the believing women, and do not increase anything for the wrongdoers except destruction.’"
The Jinn,72,1,"Say: ‘It has been revealed to me that a party of the jinn listened to (my recitation) carefully and then (went back to their people and) said: Surely, we have heard a wonderful Qur’an."
The Jinn,72,2,It shows the path of guidance. So we have believed in it and will never set up any partner with our Lord.
The Jinn,72,3,And that exalted is the Glory of our Lord. He has taken for Himself neither any wife nor any children.
The Jinn,72,4,"And that only a fool from amongst us used to utter things about Allah far from the truth, crossing bounds."
The Jinn,72,5,And that we thought that man and jinn would never tell a lie against Allah.
The Jinn,72,6,And that some of the men used to take shelter with some of the jinn. So they increased defiance amongst the jinn.
The Jinn,72,7,"And, (O party of jinn,) those men also thought just as you thought that Allah would never raise up anyone (after death)."
The Jinn,72,8,And that we touched the heavens and found them filled with high-alert guards and stars shining and burning (like brands).
The Jinn,72,9,"And that we used to sit on certain seats (in the heavens previously, to listen to the news), but if someone now seeks to listen, then he will find a flame of fire (waiting) for him in ambush."
The Jinn,72,10,"And that we do not know whether some evil has been intended (by our restriction) in respect of those people who are in the earth, or their Lord intends some good for them."
The Jinn,72,11,And that amongst us are some who are pious and there are also some (evil) exceptions amongst us. We were (following) different ways.
The Jinn,72,12,"And we have ascertained that we can by no means come in the way of Allah (whilst living) in the earth, nor can we thwart Him by escaping (from the earth)."
The Jinn,72,13,"And that when we listened to (the Book of) Guidance, we believed in it. Then he who believes in his Lord fears neither loss nor injustice."
The Jinn,72,14,"And that (some) of us are obedient and (some) of us are wrongdoers as well. So he who becomes obedient, it is they who seek righteousness."
The Jinn,72,15,"And as for the wrongdoers, they will be the fuel of Hell.’"
The Jinn,72,16,"And this (Revelation has also come to me) that if they had remained firm on the right path (the path of truth, the path of the remembrance of Allah), then We would have provided them with abundant water,"
The Jinn,72,17,"So that We put them to trial by this blessing. And whoever turns away from the remembrance of his Lord, He will cause him to enter a severe torment."
The Jinn,72,18,And that mosques are (specified) for Allah alone. So never worship anyone else besides Allah.
The Jinn,72,19,"And that when the servant of Allah (Muhammad [blessings and peace be upon him]) stood up to worship Him, they thronged around him (to listen to his recitation)."
The Jinn,72,20,Say: ‘I worship only my Lord and do not associate any partner with Him.’
The Jinn,72,21,"Say: ‘I do not possess any power to do you harm (i.e., make you disbelieve) or to do you good (i.e., make you believe. So Allah is the real Lord. I am a mediator and means).’"
The Jinn,72,22,"Say: ‘Neither can anyone shelter me from a torment (against the command) of Allah, nor can I ever find refuge apart from Him."
The Jinn,72,23,"But (my responsibility is) to communicate from Allah His commands and messages. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him), surely there is for him the Fire of Hell in which they will live forever.’"
The Jinn,72,24,"Until, when they will see that torment which is being promised to them, (then) they will come to know who is weaker in helpers and fewer in numbers."
The Jinn,72,25,"Say: ‘I do not know whether that (Day of Rising) which is being promised to you is near, or my Lord has appointed a longer term for that.’"
The Jinn,72,26,"(He is) the Knower of the unseen. So He does not inform any (common man) of His unseen,"
The Jinn,72,27,"Except for His Messengers with whom He is well-pleased (and reveals to them alone the unseen because that is an exclusive trait of Prophethood and a Messenger’s miracle as well). So indeed He appoints protectors at both front and rear of him (the Messenger, for the security of the knowledge of the unseen),"
The Jinn,72,28,"So that Allah may bring to light that surely they (the Messengers) have communicated the messages of their Lord, and Allah has (already) encompassed what they have (of Allah’s injunctions and the knowledge of the unseen) and He has kept count of everything."
The Enshrouded One,73,1,O mantled (Beloved!)
The Enshrouded One,73,2,"Rise and stand (in Prayer) at night but (for) a short while,"
The Enshrouded One,73,3,"Half the night or decrease it a little,"
The Enshrouded One,73,4,Or increase a little more to it. And recite the Qur’an with most pleasant pauses.
The Enshrouded One,73,5,Soon We shall send down to you a burdensome command.
The Enshrouded One,73,6,"No doubt rising at night strictly subdues (the ill-commanding self), and makes the tongue deliver straight and clear speech (with the concentration of head and heart)."
The Enshrouded One,73,7,"Of course, there are many commitments for you during the day."
The Enshrouded One,73,8,"And continue remembering the Name of your Lord, devoted completely to Him alone (in your heart and soul), broken away from everyone else."
The Enshrouded One,73,9,He is the Lord of the east and the west. There is no God but He. So take Him alone as (your) Guardian.
The Enshrouded One,73,10,And observe patience with what they (disbelievers) utter and turn aside from them in a fine manner.
The Enshrouded One,73,11,And leave Me (to deal) with the denying rich money-mongers (to take revenge). And give them a little respite (so that their evil deeds may cross the limit).
The Enshrouded One,73,12,"Surely, We have heavy shackles and the Blazing Fire (of Hell),"
The Enshrouded One,73,13,And food that chokes the throat and most painful torment.
The Enshrouded One,73,14,The Day when the earth and the mountains shall shake violently and mountains will turn into heaps of flying away sand.
The Enshrouded One,73,15,"Surely, We have sent towards you a Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him) who bears witness to you (seeing thoroughly your states of being) as We sent a Messenger towards Pharaoh."
The Enshrouded One,73,16,"So Pharaoh disobeyed that Messenger, and We seized him with a devastating seizure."
The Enshrouded One,73,17,"If you continue disbelieving, then how will you save yourselves from (the torment of) that Day which will turn the children old,"
The Enshrouded One,73,18,(The Day) by whose severity the heaven will be split apart? His promise is bound to be fulfilled.
The Enshrouded One,73,19,"Verily, this (Qur’an) is an admonition. So let him who desires adopt the way to reach his Lord."
The Enshrouded One,73,20,"Surely, your Lord knows that you stand (for prayer sometimes) about two-thirds of the night and (sometimes) half the night and (sometimes) a third of the night, and (also) a party of those who are with you (join in standing up for Prayer). And Allah is the One Who keeps the true measure (of increasing or decreasing) the night and the day. He knows that you just do not have the power to encompass it so He granted you forgiveness (by reducing the toil). So recite the Qur’an as much as is easy for you. He knows that (some of) you will be ill and (some) others will be travelling in the land to look for Allah’s bounty and (still some) others will be fighting in the way of Allah. So recite as much as is easy for you. And establish Prayer and pay Zakat (the Alms-due) and lend Allah a goodly loan. And whatever good you will send forward for yourselves, you will find it in the presence of Allah much better and in reward still greater. And keep seeking forgiveness from Allah. Allah is Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful."
The Cloaked One,74,1,O enwrapped (Beloved!)
The Cloaked One,74,2,Rise and give warning (to the people).
The Cloaked One,74,3,And glorify the Greatnesss (and Majesty) of your Lord.
The Cloaked One,74,4,And (always) keep your (visible and spiritual) attire purified and cleansed (as before).
The Cloaked One,74,5,And keep away from the idols (and sins as usual).
The Cloaked One,74,6,And do not do a favour (to anyone with the purpose of) seeking more from him.
The Cloaked One,74,7,And observe patience for the sake of your Lord.
The Cloaked One,74,8,"Then when the Trumpet will be blown (a second time),"
The Cloaked One,74,9,"So that Day (the Day of Resurrection) will be an extremely hard day,"
The Cloaked One,74,10,Not at all easy for the disbelievers.
The Cloaked One,74,11,"Leave Me (to take revenge) on him whom I have created alone,"
The Cloaked One,74,12,"And I provided him wealth in abundance,"
The Cloaked One,74,13,"And (gave) him sons remaining present (before him),"
The Cloaked One,74,14,And granted him affluence (in sources of luxury).
The Cloaked One,74,15,Yet he desires that I should give him more.
The Cloaked One,74,16,No way! He has certainly been inimical to Our Revelations.
The Cloaked One,74,17,Soon I shall afflict him with (the punishment of) a severe toil.
The Cloaked One,74,18,"Surely, he reflected and devised a plot."
The Cloaked One,74,19,So let (Allah’s) curse be on him! How he plotted!
The Cloaked One,74,20,Let again (Allah’s) curse be on him! How he plotted!
The Cloaked One,74,21,Then he pondered (over his scheme again).
The Cloaked One,74,22,Then he frowned and twisted his face.
The Cloaked One,74,23,Then he turned back (from the truth) and showed arrogance.
The Cloaked One,74,24,Then he said: ‘This (Qur’an) is nothing but magic which is being transmitted from the past (magicians).
The Cloaked One,74,25,This (Qur’an) is nothing (else) but the words of a human being.’
The Cloaked One,74,26,I will soon cast him into Hell.
The Cloaked One,74,27,And who has told you what Saqar (the Fire of Hell) is?
The Cloaked One,74,28,"That (is the Fire which) does not spare, nor does it leave out."
The Cloaked One,74,29,(That) scorches the skin and blackens it.
The Cloaked One,74,30,There are nineteen (angels appointed as guards) over it.
The Cloaked One,74,31,"And We have appointed only angels as guards of Hell. And We have fixed their number only as a trial for the disbelievers so that the People of the Book may believe with certitude (that the Qur’an and the Prophethood of Muhammad [blessings and peace be upon him] is a truth because the same number was given in their scriptures as well), and that the faith of the believers may further be strengthened (with this confirmation), and that the People of the Book and the believers may not doubt (its veracity), and that those having a disease (of hypocrisy) in their hearts and the disbelievers may say: ‘What does Allah intend by this example (of number)?’ In this way, Allah holds astray whom He wills, and guides aright whom He wills (with the same stroke). And no one knows the armies of your Lord except Him. And this (description of Hell is nothing else) but an admonition to mankind."
The Cloaked One,74,32,"Yes! By the moon (whose increase, decrease and disappearance is evidence),"
The Cloaked One,74,33,"And by the night when it backs away to depart,"
The Cloaked One,74,34,"And by the morning when it brightens,"
The Cloaked One,74,35,"Surely, this (Hell) is one of the greatest calamities."
The Cloaked One,74,36,"It is a warning to mankind,"
The Cloaked One,74,37,For any of you who seeks to advance forward (in piety) or who lags behind (trapped in evil);
The Cloaked One,74,38,"Everyone is held in pledge for (the deeds) that he has earned,"
The Cloaked One,74,39,Except for those on the Right Side.
The Cloaked One,74,40,"(They) will be in Gardens and will be asking one another,"
The Cloaked One,74,41,About the evildoers.
The Cloaked One,74,42,(And they will say:) ‘What has brought you into Hell?’
The Cloaked One,74,43,They will say: ‘We were not of those who used to offer Prayers.
The Cloaked One,74,44,Nor did we feed the poor.
The Cloaked One,74,45,And we indulged in vain activities with those who had cast themselves into vain activities.
The Cloaked One,74,46,"And we rejected the Day of Reward and Punishment,"
The Cloaked One,74,47,"Until that (death), which was certain to come, came upon us.’"
The Cloaked One,74,48,So (now) the intercession of the intercessors will not be of any benefit to them.
The Cloaked One,74,49,"Then what is the matter with these (disbelievers that even then) they turn away from the Reminder,"
The Cloaked One,74,50,"As if they were startled (wild) donkeys,"
The Cloaked One,74,51,Fleeing away from a lion?
The Cloaked One,74,52,"In fact, every one of them desires that he should be given (directly) open scrolls of (heavenly) scriptures."
The Cloaked One,74,53,That is not possible at all. Rather (the fact is that) they fear not the Last Day.
The Cloaked One,74,54,There is no doubt that this (Qur’an) is a Reminder.
The Cloaked One,74,55,So whoever wills may remember it.
The Cloaked One,74,56,"And they will not remember (it) unless Allah so wills. He is the One to Whom fear (and righteousness) is due, and He alone is the Lord of forgiveness."
The Rising of the Dead,75,1,I swear by the Day of Resurrection.
The Rising of the Dead,75,2,"And I swear by the blaming self, reproaching (itself for evil deeds)."
The Rising of the Dead,75,3,Does man think We shall not at all collect his bones (which will decompose into dust particles after his death)?
The Rising of the Dead,75,4,"Yes, of course! We have also the power to restore and set right even his finger joints and finger tips."
The Rising of the Dead,75,5,Yet man still wants to continue committing sins also (in the life to come).
The Rising of the Dead,75,6,He asks (scornfully): ‘When is the Day of Resurrection?’
The Rising of the Dead,75,7,"But when the eyes will be dazzled,"
The Rising of the Dead,75,8,"And the moon will be eclipsed,"
The Rising of the Dead,75,9,"And the sun and the moon will be fused (i.e., darkened) together,"
The Rising of the Dead,75,10,On that Day man will cry out: ‘Where to flee away?’
The Rising of the Dead,75,11,No indeed! There is no place of refuge.
The Rising of the Dead,75,12,The place of refuge and repose that Day will be with your Lord alone.
The Rising of the Dead,75,13,That Day man will be informed of those (deeds) which he sent forward and those (repercussions) which he left behind (after his death).
The Rising of the Dead,75,14,"In truth, man will (himself) be aware of (the affairs of) his self,"
The Rising of the Dead,75,15,Even though he will offer all his excuses.
The Rising of the Dead,75,16,(O Beloved!) Do not move your tongue in a hurry (to learn the Qur’an by heart when it is revealed to you).
The Rising of the Dead,75,17,"Assuredly, upon Us rests its collection and preservation (in your breast) and its recitation (by your tongue)."
The Rising of the Dead,75,18,"So when We complete its recitation (by the tongue of Jibril [Gabriel]), then follow that recitation."
The Rising of the Dead,75,19,Then surely upon Us is the clear exposition (of its implications).
The Rising of the Dead,75,20,"The truth is, (O disbelievers,) that you love (the world) which you can readily gain."
The Rising of the Dead,75,21,And you have left aside the Hereafter.
The Rising of the Dead,75,22,"Many faces will be fresh and in full bloom that Day,"
The Rising of the Dead,75,23,Beholding (the enchanting radiance and beauty of) their Lord (unveiled).
The Rising of the Dead,75,24,"And many faces will be deformed (depressed and dark) that Day,"
The Rising of the Dead,75,25,Thinking that they will be subjected to such a harsh treatment that will break their backbones.
The Rising of the Dead,75,26,"No indeed! When the soul reaches the throat,"
The Rising of the Dead,75,27,And it is said: ‘Who can (now) treat him with magic (to cure him)?’
The Rising of the Dead,75,28,And (the departing soul) comes to realize that (now) is the hour of parting (with all).
The Rising of the Dead,75,29,And one leg clings to the other;
The Rising of the Dead,75,30,Towards your Lord is the departure that Day.
The Rising of the Dead,75,31,So (how ill-fated is he that) he neither affirmed (what the Messenger said) nor offered Prayer.
The Rising of the Dead,75,32,Rather he kept belying and turning away.
The Rising of the Dead,75,33,Then he went off towards his family in arrogance.
The Rising of the Dead,75,34,"Woe to you (when dying), then woe to you (in the grave),"
The Rising of the Dead,75,35,"Then again woe to you (on the Last Day), then woe to you (in Hell)!"
The Rising of the Dead,75,36,Does man think that he will be left for nothing (without any reckoning)?
The Rising of the Dead,75,37,Was he not (in his beginning) a sperm drop ejaculated (into the woman’s womb)?
The Rising of the Dead,75,38,Then it developed into a hanging mass (clinging to the womb like a nest). Then He created (in it the preliminary form of all the limbs of the body). Then He set (them) right.
The Rising of the Dead,75,39,Then He made from the same sperm drop two genders: male and female.
The Rising of the Dead,75,40,Then has He not the power to give life to the dead again?
Time or Man,76,1,"Surely, there has passed over man a period of time when he was not a thing worth mentioning."
Time or Man,76,2,"Surely, We created man from a fertilized ovum that We keep turning and examining (from one stage to the next till birth). So We have made him (in the order of) hearing (then) seeing."
Time or Man,76,3,"Indeed, We also showed him the way (to understanding and insight for distinguishing between the truth and falsehood) whether he (now) becomes thankful or continues to be ungrateful."
Time or Man,76,4,"Verily, We have prepared for the disbelievers chains (for the feet), neck-fetters and the Blazing Fire (of Hell)."
Time or Man,76,5,"Surely, the sincerely devoted and obedient will drink from the cups (of the holy drink) mixed with kafur (to enhance its aroma, colour and taste)."
Time or Man,76,6,"(Kafur is) a spring (in Paradise) that (the privileged) servants of Allah (i.e., Awliya’ Allah) will drink from, and will (also) make it flow to wherever they will desire in the form of small brooks (to make others drink of it)."
Time or Man,76,7,(These privileged servants of Allah are those) who fulfil their vows and keep fearing that Day whose severity spreads afar.
Time or Man,76,8,"And they give (their own) food, in deep love of Allah, to the needy, the orphan and prisoner (out of sacrifice, despite their own desire and need for it),"
Time or Man,76,9,(And say:) ‘We are feeding you only to please Allah. We do not seek any recompense from you nor (wish for) any thanks.
Time or Man,76,10,We fear from our Lord the Day which will make (the faces) look very dark (and) ugly.’
Time or Man,76,11,"So Allah will save them from the terror of that Day (for their fear of Allah) and will grant them freshness, bloom and blush (on their faces) and ecstasy and delight (in their hearts),"
Time or Man,76,12,"And will bless them with Gardens (to live in) and silky clothes (to wear), a reward for their patience."
Time or Man,76,13,"Reclining in it against cushions on raised couches, they will find there neither intense cold nor heat."
Time or Man,76,14,"And the shades (of trees in Paradise) will close upon them, and the bunches of their (fruits) will be hanging low."
Time or Man,76,15,"And (the servants) will go round them with vessels of silver and (pure and clean) goblets of shining glass,"
Time or Man,76,16,And glasses made of silver which they will have filled with exact measures (according to everyone’s desire).
Time or Man,76,17,And they will be made to drink there cups of (the holy drink) mixed with Zanjabil.
Time or Man,76,18,(Zanjabil is) a spring in this (Paradise) named Salsabil.
Time or Man,76,19,"And going round them will be (innocent) adolescents who will remain ever-young. When you will see them, you will consider them as scattered pearls."
Time or Man,76,20,"And when you will look (at Paradise), you will find blessings (in abundance) and a mighty kingdom (all around)."
Time or Man,76,21,"They will be clad in green, fine silk and rich brocade attire, and they will be made to wear silver bracelets, and their Lord will make them drink a holy beverage."
Time or Man,76,22,"Surely, that will be your reward and your hard work is acknowledged."
Time or Man,76,23,"Indeed, We have revealed the Qur’an to you piecemeal."
Time or Man,76,24,"So (continue to) be patient for the sake of your Lord’s command and do not give your ear to any liar, sinner or disbeliever or thankless person from amongst them."
Time or Man,76,25,And remember the Name of your Lord morning and evening.
Time or Man,76,26,"And prostrate yourself before His presence for some hours of the night, and glorify Him during (the rest of) the long hours of the night."
Time or Man,76,27,"Surely, these (world-mongers) love the gains that are achievable right away. And they have put behind their backs (the remembrance of) the very hard Day."
Time or Man,76,28,"(They do not realize that) We alone have created them and have made their every joint strong, and We can replace them whenever We may please with the people like them."
Time or Man,76,29,"Indeed, this (Qur’an) is a Reminder. So whoever desires may adopt the way to (reach) his Lord."
Time or Man,76,30,"And you cannot wish anything yourselves except what Allah wills. Indeed, Allah is All-Knowing, Most Wise."
Time or Man,76,31,"He admits whom He wills to (the circle of) His mercy, and He has prepared a grievous torment for the wrongdoers."
The Emissaries,77,1,"By the soft blowing, pleasant breezes which blow in succession,"
The Emissaries,77,2,"Then by the violent winds which blow with fierce gusts,"
The Emissaries,77,3,"And by those which spread the clouds all around,"
The Emissaries,77,4,"Then by those which split (them) apart and break them off,"
The Emissaries,77,5,"Then by those which bring direction and guidance,"
The Emissaries,77,6,"To accomplish the argument or to warn,"
The Emissaries,77,7,"Surely, the promise (of the Last Day) which is being given to you will be certainly fulfilled."
The Emissaries,77,8,"Then when the light of the stars will be extinguished,"
The Emissaries,77,9,"And when the heavenly universe will be split open,"
The Emissaries,77,10,"And when the mountains will be (broken down to dust) and blown off,"
The Emissaries,77,11,"And when the Messengers will be brought together at the appointed time (to bear witness to their respective communities),"
The Emissaries,77,12,"Well, for what Day is the term (of all the affairs) appointed?"
The Emissaries,77,13,For the Day of Judgment!
The Emissaries,77,14,And who has told you what the Day of Judgment is?
The Emissaries,77,15,Woe (and devastation) to the deniers on that Day!
The Emissaries,77,16,Did We not destroy the people (who denied) before?
The Emissaries,77,17,Then We also cause the later ones to follow them (in destruction).
The Emissaries,77,18,This is how We sort out (the matter) with the evildoers.
The Emissaries,77,19,Woe to the deniers on that Day!
The Emissaries,77,20,Did We not create you from (a drop) of detestable fluid?
The Emissaries,77,21,"Then We placed it in a secure place (i.e., the mother’s womb),"
The Emissaries,77,22,Till an appointed period (of time).
The Emissaries,77,23,Then We determined time periods (for all the stages of growth from conception to birth). And how excellent do We determine!
The Emissaries,77,24,Woe to the deniers on that Day!
The Emissaries,77,25,"Have We not made the earth an assembling expanse,"
The Emissaries,77,26,(That draws together) the living (as well as) the dead?
The Emissaries,77,27,"And We placed on it soaring high and firm mountains, and gave you sweet water to drink (from springs of sweet, fresh water)."
The Emissaries,77,28,Woe to the deniers on that Day!
The Emissaries,77,29,(Now) move on to that (torment) which you used to deny.
The Emissaries,77,30,"Proceed towards that shadow (of the smoke of Hell) that forks into three columns,"
The Emissaries,77,31,A shadow which is neither cool nor protecting against the heat of Fire.
The Emissaries,77,32,"Indeed, that (Hell) throws up sparks and flames (huge) as a lofty palace."
The Emissaries,77,33,(It also appears) as if those (sparks) are yellow camels.
The Emissaries,77,34,Woe to the deniers on that Day!
The Emissaries,77,35,This is a Day (on which) they will not be able to speak too.
The Emissaries,77,36,Nor will they be allowed to offer any excuses.
The Emissaries,77,37,Woe to the deniers on that Day!
The Emissaries,77,38,This is the Day of Judgment (on which) We shall gather you and (all) the earlier communities.
The Emissaries,77,39,"Then if you have any scheme (and trick to escape from the torment), try (that) against Me."
The Emissaries,77,40,"Woe (i.e., dejection) to the deniers on that Day!"
The Emissaries,77,41,"Surely, the Godfearing will be (rejoicing) under cool shades and amid springs."
The Emissaries,77,42,And whatever fruits they will long for (will be available for them).
The Emissaries,77,43,(It will be said to them:) ‘Enjoy eating and drinking to your taste as a reward for what you used to do.’
The Emissaries,77,44,"Indeed, the same way do We reward the pious."
The Emissaries,77,45,Woe to the deniers on that Day!
The Emissaries,77,46,"(O deniers of the truth!) Eat and enjoy yourselves for a short while. No doubt, you are the evildoers."
The Emissaries,77,47,Woe to the deniers on that Day!
The Emissaries,77,48,"And when it is said to them: ‘Bow down (before Allah),’ they do not bow."
The Emissaries,77,49,Woe to the deniers on that Day!
The Emissaries,77,50,Then in what revelation after this (Qur’an) will they believe?
The Tidings,78,1,What is (it) they are questioning about one another?
The Tidings,78,2,"(Are they asking) of the Great News,"
The Tidings,78,3,About which they differ?
The Tidings,78,4,(That News is) not at all (deniable). They will soon know (that reality).
The Tidings,78,5,(We) once more (assert: Dissent and denial are) in no way (right). They will come to know soon.
The Tidings,78,6,Have We not made the earth a place to stay for (life) and to earn living and deeds?
The Tidings,78,7,And (have We not) erected mountains raised (out of it)?
The Tidings,78,8,And (ponder:) We (have) created you in pairs (for reproduction).
The Tidings,78,9,"And We (have) made your sleep (a means of bodily) rest,"
The Tidings,78,10,And We (have) made the night a covering (by virtue of its darkness).
The Tidings,78,11,And We (have) made the day (a time) for (earning) livelihood.
The Tidings,78,12,And (now study the spatial universe as well). We built above you seven strong (firmaments).
The Tidings,78,13,And We made (the sun a massive) fountainhead of light and heat.
The Tidings,78,14,"And We poured water in torrents from rain-laden clouds,"
The Tidings,78,15,"So that by means of this (downpour), We bring forth (from the earth) grain and vegetation,"
The Tidings,78,16,And (grow) thick gardens.
The Tidings,78,17,"(Observing these signs of Our Might, know that) the Day of Judgment (i.e., Resurrection too) is certainly a fixed time."
The Tidings,78,18,"The Day when the Trumpet will be blown, you will flock (in the holy presence of Allah) in droves."
The Tidings,78,19,"And the (layers of) heaven will be torn, and (owing to the rip) they will become (as if) all doors."
The Tidings,78,20,And the mountains (after being reduced to dust) will be blown off (into the atmosphere); so they will be (eliminated like) a mirage.
The Tidings,78,21,"Surely, Hell is a place of ambush."
The Tidings,78,22,(That) is the abode of rebels.
The Tidings,78,23,"They will abide there for recurrent, infinite periods."
The Tidings,78,24,"They will taste in it neither coolness (of any sort) nor any drink,"
The Tidings,78,25,"Except boiling water and suppurated fluid oozing (from the wounds of the inmates of Hell),"
The Tidings,78,26,"A compensation commensurate with (their revolt),"
The Tidings,78,27,For they had no fear of Reckoning (on the Last Day) in the least.
The Tidings,78,28,And they used to utterly deny Our signs.
The Tidings,78,29,And We have preserved everything (major or minor) in writing.
The Tidings,78,30,"(O disbelievers, you excelled in rebellion and disbelief in the world.) Now taste the outcome (of your actions). We shall keep increasing but the torment upon you."
The Tidings,78,31,"Surely, the Godfearing will triumph."
The Tidings,78,32,"(For them) there will be gardens and grapes,"
The Tidings,78,33,"And well-matched young maidens,"
The Tidings,78,34,And overflowing cups (of holy beverage).
The Tidings,78,35,"There, these (people) will neither hear any foolish talk nor belie (one another)."
The Tidings,78,36,From your Lord this is the reward which is an (amply) sufficient bestowal (in proportion to your works).
The Tidings,78,37,"He is the Lord of (all) the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them, the Most Kind. (But on the Last Day, the effect and impact of His mighty power and most high authority will be such that) none (from His creation) will dare converse with Him."
The Tidings,78,38,"That Day Gabriel (the Spirit of peace and security) and (all) angels will stand in ranks, none able to speak except he whom the Most Kind (Lord) would already have awarded sanction (to intercede) and who also said the right thing (in keeping with the teachings of Islam, during his life of the world)."
The Tidings,78,39,"This is the Day of truth. So, whoever longs may obtain an abode (of mercy and nearness) in the presence of his Lord."
The Tidings,78,40,"We have, indeed, warned you of the impending torment. On that Day, everyone will see whatever (acts) he has sent ahead and (every) disbeliever will say: ‘Would that I were dust (and escaped this punishment)!’"
Those Who Drag Forth,79,1,"By the (angels) who violently snatch out (the souls of the disbelievers from each tendon and ligament of their body), Or By the waves of energy that pierce into matter and break up the chemical bonds fiercely,"
Those Who Drag Forth,79,2,"And by the (angels) who unweave sinews (of the believers’ organisms) gently and peacefully, Or By the waves of energy that disintegrate gently and peacefully the chemical bonds within matter,"
Those Who Drag Forth,79,3,"And by the (angels) who swiftly glide (between the heavens and the earth), Or By the waves of energy that move around freely in space and atmosphere,"
Those Who Drag Forth,79,4,"Then by the (angels) who with burst of speed sprint past others, Or By the waves of energy that surpass other waves in speed, force and assimilation,"
Those Who Drag Forth,79,5,"Then by the (angels) who manage different affairs well, Or By the waves of energy that, through mutual dynamism and coordination, maintain equilibrium and keep the balance of the management going for the survival of the system of the universe,"
Those Who Drag Forth,79,6,"(When they will be commanded to devastate the system of the universe) that Day, everything in motion (in the universe) will tremor into violent convulsion,"
Those Who Drag Forth,79,7,Chased by a succeeding convulsion.
Those Who Drag Forth,79,8,"That Day, hearts (of the people) will pound with agony and terror."
Those Who Drag Forth,79,9,Their eyes will be downcast (with dread and horror).
Those Who Drag Forth,79,10,The disbelievers say: ‘Shall we be reverted to the former life?
Those Who Drag Forth,79,11,(Shall we be given life even) when we shall have become rotten (hollow) bones?’
Those Who Drag Forth,79,12,They say: ‘This (return) would then be a losing return.’
Those Who Drag Forth,79,13,Then it will be rending (of all heavenly bodies) asunder with single extremely horrible explosion.
Those Who Drag Forth,79,14,Then they (all) will forgather suddenly in the open expanse (for assembly).
Those Who Drag Forth,79,15,Has the account of Musa (Moses) reached you?
Those Who Drag Forth,79,16,"When His Lord called out to him in the sacred valley of Tuwa,"
Those Who Drag Forth,79,17,(And commanded:) ‘Go to Pharaoh. He has transgressed all bounds.’
Those Who Drag Forth,79,18,Then say (to him): ‘Do you wish that you should be purified?
Those Who Drag Forth,79,19,And (do you desire that) I guide you to your Lord so that you may fear (Him)?’
Those Who Drag Forth,79,20,Then Musa (Moses) showed him the great sign.
Those Who Drag Forth,79,21,But he denied it and disobeyed.
Those Who Drag Forth,79,22,"Then, turning away (from the truth), he launched struggle (in rivalry against Musa [Moses])."
Those Who Drag Forth,79,23,"So he gathered (people) and started calling out,"
Those Who Drag Forth,79,24,"And said: ‘I am your lord, most high.’"
Those Who Drag Forth,79,25,Then Allah seized him in (dual) punishment of this world and the Hereafter.
Those Who Drag Forth,79,26,"Surely, in this (incident) there is a great lesson of warning for him who fears (Allah)."
Those Who Drag Forth,79,27,"Is it you who are harder to create, or (the entire) galactic universe that He has built?"
Those Who Drag Forth,79,28,"He raised high all the heavenly spheres (planets, after creating them in the infinite cosmos), then moderated, equipoised and stabilized (their composition, construction, functions and movements)."
Those Who Drag Forth,79,29,"And He is the One Who blackened the night of heavenly space (i.e., darkened the entire spatial environment like a murky night) and emitted (after creating) the light of these (planets from this space)."
Those Who Drag Forth,79,30,"And He is the One Who, later, (after the creation of the planet sun) separated (from it) the earth, flung it with centrifugal force (and spread its expanse to make it inhabitable)."
Those Who Drag Forth,79,31,"He is the One Who drew water from the earth (separately), and brought forth its vegetable kingdom (from the rest of the dry regions)."
Those Who Drag Forth,79,32,And He is the One Who (putting together different elements) raised from the earth firmly fixed mountains.
Those Who Drag Forth,79,33,(He did all this) for the benefit of you and your livestock.
Those Who Drag Forth,79,34,"Then, whilst (the universe) attains (to its acme through evolution), there will befall the great all-encompassing calamity (the Hour of Resurrection)."
Those Who Drag Forth,79,35,That Day man will retrospect his (every) effort and action.
Those Who Drag Forth,79,36,And Hell will be made manifest to everyone who can see.
Those Who Drag Forth,79,37,"Then he who transgressed the limits,"
Those Who Drag Forth,79,38,"And preferred the life of the world (to the Hereafter),"
Those Who Drag Forth,79,39,Hell will truly be (his) abode.
Those Who Drag Forth,79,40,"But as for him who feared standing in the presence of his Lord and forbade (his ill-commanding) self its appetites and lusts,"
Those Who Drag Forth,79,41,Paradise will surely be (his) abode.
Those Who Drag Forth,79,42,(The disbelievers) ask you about the Hour of Rising: ‘When will it come to pass?’
Those Who Drag Forth,79,43,What should be your concern in talking about (its appointed time)?
Those Who Drag Forth,79,44,"Its ultimate limit is up to your Lord (i.e., as in the beginning, only Oneness will survive in the end as well)."
Those Who Drag Forth,79,45,You are but a Warner to him who fears it.
Those Who Drag Forth,79,46,"So the Day when they will see it, they (will feel as if they) did not tarry (in the world) but for one evening or one morning."
He Frowned,80,1,"A feeling of uneasiness came upon his (holy) face, and he turned aside his (radiant) face,"
He Frowned,80,2,Because a blind man approached him (who interrupted his discourse).
He Frowned,80,3,"And what do you know? Perhaps he would be purified (further owing to your attending to him),"
He Frowned,80,4,Or would accept (your) advice which would provide him benefit (more and more).
He Frowned,80,5,"But the one who disregards (the Din [Religion)],"
He Frowned,80,6,"You administer greater care (for his acceptance of Islam),"
He Frowned,80,7,"Whereas there is no (burden of) responsibility on you, even if he does not adopt purification (i.e., faith)."
He Frowned,80,8,"And as for him who has (himself) come to you exerting (in pursuit of piousness),"
He Frowned,80,9,"And he fears (his Lord) as well,"
He Frowned,80,10,But you are not focusing your attention on him.
He Frowned,80,11,(O My Esteemed Beloved!) Not so indeed! These (Verses of the Holy Qur’an) are but advice.
He Frowned,80,12,The one who seeks may accept it (and learn by heart).
He Frowned,80,13,"(They are inscribed) on venerable and revered pages,"
He Frowned,80,14,"Which are exalted (and) purified,"
He Frowned,80,15,"(Have come forth) by the hands of emissaries (and scribes),"
He Frowned,80,16,Who are possessors of eminence (and) embodiments of obedience.
He Frowned,80,17,Be cursed (the disbelieving) man! How ungrateful he is!
He Frowned,80,18,From what stuff has Allah created him?
He Frowned,80,19,"He created him from a sperm drop, then determined his measure along with that (regarding genes and sex),"
He Frowned,80,20,"Then (after structuring, developing and completing it) eased for him the passage (of delivery from the mother’s womb),"
He Frowned,80,21,Then caused him to die and (buried him) in a grave.
He Frowned,80,22,"Then whenever He wills, He will raise them up (alive again)."
He Frowned,80,23,"Indeed, he (the disobedient man) did not fulfil that (obligatory due) which (Allah) had commanded him."
He Frowned,80,24,So man should look at his food (and ponder).
He Frowned,80,25,"Indeed, We pour down water in torrents."
He Frowned,80,26,Then We split the earth and tear it asunder.
He Frowned,80,27,"We then grow from it grain,"
He Frowned,80,28,"And grapes and vegetables,"
He Frowned,80,29,"And the olive and the date palm,"
He Frowned,80,30,"And thickly planted dense gardens,"
He Frowned,80,31,"And (a variety of) fruits and (animals’) fodder,"
He Frowned,80,32,As provision both for you and your livestock (to live on).
He Frowned,80,33,"So, when the Deafening Blast comes,"
He Frowned,80,34,"On that Day man will flee from his brother,"
He Frowned,80,35,"And from his mother and his father (too),"
He Frowned,80,36,And (even) from his wife and his children.
He Frowned,80,37,On that Day every person will be in such a (dismal) state that will make him unconcerned (with everyone else).
He Frowned,80,38,The same Day many faces will be shining (with light).
He Frowned,80,39,"(They will be) smiling, laughing (and) rejoicing."
He Frowned,80,40,And numerous faces there will be covered with dust that Day.
He Frowned,80,41,These (faces) will be overshadowed with darkness (as well).
He Frowned,80,42,"They are the people who are disbelievers (and) mischief-mongers (i.e., evildoers)."

The Overthrowing,81,17,"And by the night when its darkness tapers off,"
The Overthrowing,81,18,"And by the morning when its light dawns,"
The Overthrowing,81,19,"Indeed, this (Qur’an) is the Word (communicated) by a glorious and most venerable Messenger (blessings and peace be upon him),"
The Overthrowing,81,20,"Who is mighty and strong (in calling to the truth, preaching the faith in Messengership and spiritual competence, and) is held in extreme reverence and veneration (and splendour and glory) in the presence of the Lord of the Throne,"
The Overthrowing,81,21,Entitled to obligatory obedience (by all the worlds because obedience to him is obedience to Allah) and faithful to His trust (possesses Revelation and all divine secrets of the heavens and the earth).

The Overthrowing,81,23,And he has indeed seen (the absolute beauty of the Lord of the Throne) on the effulgent horizon (of the realm of Divinity).*
The Overthrowing,81,24,And he (the glorious Messenger [blessings and peace be upon him]) is not at all miserly in (disclosing) the unseen. (The Lord of the Throne has not left for him any deficiency.)
The Overthrowing,81,25,Nor is that (Qur’an) the utterance of any accursed Satan.
The Overthrowing,81,26,"Then, (O you doomed,) where are you going (disregarding such a valuable treasure)?"
The Overthrowing,81,27,This (Qur’an) is but admonition (revealed) for all the worlds.
The Overthrowing,81,28,Every one of you who aspires to tread the straight path (can take guidance from this source spring).
The Overthrowing,81,29,"And you can aspire only to what Allah intends, Who is the Sustainer of all the worlds."
The Cleaving,82,1,"When (all) the heavenly spheres will be split apart,"
The Cleaving,82,2,"And when the planets will fall and scatter,"
The Cleaving,82,3,"And when oceans (and rivers) will flood and overflow,"
The Cleaving,82,4,"And when graves will be overturned,"
The Cleaving,82,5,Then everyone will come to know what actions he sent forward and what he left behind.
The Cleaving,82,6,"O man! What has deluded you concerning your Gracious Lord,"
The Cleaving,82,7,"(The One) Who created you (from a fertiled ovum in the mother’s womb), then, (to structure your limbs at the fetal stage,) He shaped you aright, then brought about proportionate alteration in your constitution?"
The Cleaving,82,8,He constituted you in whatever form He willed.
The Cleaving,82,9,"That is the truth, (but) on the contrary, you deny the Day of Recompense,"
The Cleaving,82,10,"Whereas there are guardian angels appointed over you,"
The Cleaving,82,11,"(Who are) dignified, the scribes (writing the records of all your deeds)."
The Cleaving,82,12,They know (all) those (actions) which you do.
The Cleaving,82,13,"Indeed, the truly good will be in the Garden of Bliss."
The Cleaving,82,14,"And surely, the evildoers will be in the (Blazing Fire of) Hell."
The Cleaving,82,15,"They will enter it on the Day of Rising,"
The Cleaving,82,16,And will never be able to absent themselves from it (Hell).
The Cleaving,82,17,And what have you made out what the Day of Recompense is?
The Cleaving,82,18,So what have you learnt about what the Day of Recompense is?
The Cleaving,82,19,"It is the Day when no soul will own anything for any other soul, and the command on that Day will be entirely Allah’s."
Defrauding,83,1,Woe to those who give less in measure or weight!
Defrauding,83,2,"When (they) take by measure from others, they take (from them) full."
Defrauding,83,3,"And when they (themselves) give by measure or weigh to others, they give them less."
Defrauding,83,4,"Do they not believe that they will be raised up (again after death),"
Defrauding,83,5,"For a Terrible Day,"
Defrauding,83,6,The Day when all mankind will stand before the Lord of all the worlds?
Defrauding,83,7,It is true that the record of the evildoers is kept in Sijjin (the ante-chamber of Hell).
Defrauding,83,8,And what do you know what Sijjin is?
Defrauding,83,9,"It is an inscribed book (set down in the large ante-chamber of the prison of Hell, with the names and evil deeds of every inmate of Hell registered in it)."
Defrauding,83,10,"Woe to the deniers on that Day,"
Defrauding,83,11,Those who deny the Day of Recompense!
Defrauding,83,12,And no one else denies it except every defiant and sinner.
Defrauding,83,13,"When Our Revelations are read out to him, he says (or thinks) that (they are) tales of the ancients."
Defrauding,83,14,"That is not at all (the case); rather (the fact is that the evil deeds) which they earned have rusted their hearts. (The Revelations, therefore, do not move their hearts.)"
Defrauding,83,15,The truth is that they will be screened off (to deprive them of) the sight of their Lord.
Defrauding,83,16,Then they will be cast into Hell.
Defrauding,83,17,Then it will be said to them: ‘This is (the punishment of Hell) which you used to belie.’
Defrauding,83,18,This is (also) true that the record of the truly pious is for sure maintained in ‘Illiyyin (the ante-chamber of Paradise).
Defrauding,83,19,And what do you know what ‘Illiyyin is?
Defrauding,83,20,It is an inscribed book (set down in the large ante-chamber of a lofty mansion of Paradise with the names and pious deeds of those who will be allocated superior stations in Paradise).
Defrauding,83,21,The angels closest (to Allah) remain present here.
Defrauding,83,22,"Indeed, the truly pious, (joyful and glad,) will be in blissful Paradise,"
Defrauding,83,23,"Reclining on couches, enjoying the wonderful sights."
Defrauding,83,24,You will find on their faces the glow and freshness of bliss and delight.
Defrauding,83,25,They shall be served with securely sealed delicious and holy beverage.
Defrauding,83,26,"Its seal will be musk. And (it is this beverage which) all aspirants should hastily strive and compete to acquire. (Some seek the drink of bliss whilst others long for the drink of nearness, and still others yearn for the drink of countenance—all will be served according to their respective tastes)."
Defrauding,83,27,And this (beverage of Paradise) will be mixed with the water of Tasnim.
Defrauding,83,28,(This Tasnim) is a fountain at which only those drawn close will drink.
Defrauding,83,29,"Surely (in the worldly life), the evildoers used to ridicule the believers,"
Defrauding,83,30,And winked at one another when they passed by them.
Defrauding,83,31,"And when they went back to their families, they used to exult over the believers (by comparing the believers’ destitution and their own affluence) and returned speaking of them with jests."
Defrauding,83,32,"And when they (the arrogant people) saw these (the indigent believers), they used to say: ‘They have gone astray,’ (i.e., they have lost the world whilst the Hereafter is nothing but fiction.)"
Defrauding,83,33,Yet they had not been sent to watch over their (state of affairs).
Defrauding,83,34,So (see) Today the believers are laughing at the disbelievers.
Defrauding,83,35,"Reclining on ornamented couches, they are viewing the sight (comparing their own prosperity and the disbelievers’ impoverishment)."
Defrauding,83,36,"So, have the disbelievers been rewarded in full for (the mockery), which they used to inflict upon (the believers)?"
The Sundering,84,1,"When (all) the heavenly bodies will split asunder,"
The Sundering,84,2,"And obey the command of their Lord (with regard to the catastrophic split) and (it is this implementation of the command) that they are bound to do,"
The Sundering,84,3,"And when the earth will be flattened out (after it is broken into dust particles),"
The Sundering,84,4,"And it will cast out all that is inside it and become empty,"
The Sundering,84,5,And (it) will (also) obey the command of its Lord (with regard to the catastrophic split) and (it is this obedience) which it is worthy of.
The Sundering,84,6,"O man! You sustain rigours to reach your Lord. Ultimately, you will meet Him."
The Sundering,84,7,"So as for him who will be given his record in his right hand,"
The Sundering,84,8,"He will soon be given an easy reckoning,"
The Sundering,84,9,And will return to his family rejoicing.
The Sundering,84,10,"And as for him who will be given his record behind his back,"
The Sundering,84,11,He will soon cry out for death.
The Sundering,84,12,And he will enter the Blazing Fire of Hell.
The Sundering,84,13,"Surely, he lived joyfully with his family (in the world)."
The Sundering,84,14,"No doubt, he thought he would never return (to his Lord) for reckoning."
The Sundering,84,15,"Why not! Indeed, his Lord is ever watching him."
The Sundering,84,16,"So I swear by the evening glow (i.e., the twilight or its later glare),"
The Sundering,84,17,"And by the night and all that it envelops (under its embrace),"
The Sundering,84,18,"And the moon when it appears full,"
The Sundering,84,19,You will assuredly ride along stage by stage.
The Sundering,84,20,"So, what is the matter with them that (even after witnessing the truth of the forecast of the Qur’an), they do not believe?"
The Sundering,84,21,"And when the Qur’an is recited to them, they do not fall down prostrate (before Allah)?"
The Sundering,84,22,"Instead, the disbelievers (further) deny it."
The Sundering,84,23,And Allah knows best (the contention and disbelief) which they are piling.
The Sundering,84,24,So give them the news of a painful punishment.
The Sundering,84,25,"But those who believe and do pious deeds, for them is an unending (i.e., everlasting) reward."

The Mansions of the Stars,85,22,(Inscribed) in the very Well-guarded Tablet (al-Lawh al-Mahfuz).
The Morning Star,86,1,By the (endless expanse and infinite space of) heaven and the Nightly (discernable) Visitant.
The Morning Star,86,2,And what do you know what the Nightly (discernable) Visitant is?
The Morning Star,86,3,"(It implies) every heavenly body (be it a star, a planet, or any of the heavenly spheres) which shines and brightens (the space).*"
The Morning Star,86,4,There is no human soul but with a protector (appointed) over it.
The Morning Star,86,5,So man should ponder (and find out) from what substance he has been created.
The Morning Star,86,6,"He has been created from the ejaculated fluid (i.e., virile and motile sperm)."
The Morning Star,86,7,That proceeds from the middle of the sacrum (and pelvic girdle) and is ejected.
The Morning Star,86,8,"Indeed, He has the power to bring it (life) back,"
The Morning Star,86,9,The Day when all secrets will be disclosed.
The Morning Star,86,10,Then man will have neither any strength (himself) nor any helper.
The Morning Star,86,11,"By the heavenly universe which will regress to its primitive state,"
The Morning Star,86,12,"And by the earth which will split asunder (and change into dust particles),"
The Morning Star,86,13,"This is indeed a decisive (i.e., absolute) commandment."
The Morning Star,86,14,And it is no joke!
The Morning Star,86,15,"Indeed, they (the disbelievers) are hatching plots."
The Morning Star,86,16,And I am designing My own strategy.
The Morning Star,86,17,"So give the disbelievers a respite (for a while, not much); let them relax a little (more)."
The Most High,87,1,"Glorify the Name of your Lord, the Most High,"
The Most High,87,2,"He Who has created (everything in the universe) and then (fulfilling all requisites) equipoised it to its exact proportion,"
The Most High,87,3,"And He Who has determined law, and guided (it to its) way (of sustaining and functioning according to its respective system),"
The Most High,87,4,"And He Who has brought forth green pasture (from the earth),"
The Most High,87,5,And then made it blackened stubble.
The Most High,87,6,"(O Esteemed Beloved!) We shall teach you (in a way) that nothing will you (ever) forget,"
The Most High,87,7,"Except what Allah wills. Indeed, He knows all, the manifest as well as the hidden (i.e., open to human perception as well as veiled from it, and the audible and the inaudible)."
The Most High,87,8,And We shall (also) facilitate you (to put into practice this) easy (law).
The Most High,87,9,"So keep admonishing, provided admonition benefits (the listeners)."
The Most High,87,10,But only he who fears (Allah) will accept the admonition.
The Most High,87,11,"And the wretched one will avoid and evade it,"
The Most High,87,12,He who will enter the greatest Fire (on the Day of Judgment).
The Most High,87,13,Then he will neither die nor live in it.
The Most High,87,14,"Indeed, only he who is purified (from the afflictions of his ill-commanding self and pollution of sins) will triumph,"
The Most High,87,15,And the one who remembers the Name of his Lord and offers Prayers (regularly and abundantly).
The Most High,87,16,"Yet you go for the (pleasures of) the worldly life (instead of turning towards Allah),"
The Most High,87,17,Whereas (the comfort and pleasure of) the Hereafter is preferable and everlasting.
The Most High,87,18,"Indeed, this (enlightenment) is (also contained) in earlier scriptures,"
The Most High,87,19,The scriptures of Ibrahim (Abraham) and Musa (Moses).
The Overwhelming,88,1,Has the news of the Calamity overwhelming (everything) reached you?
The Overwhelming,88,2,"Many faces on that Day will be humiliated and degraded,"
The Overwhelming,88,3,"(Forgetting Allah,) toiling (for worldly gains), sustaining (strenuous) rigours (for a fleeting luxury),"
The Overwhelming,88,4,Will plunge into the Blazing Fire.
The Overwhelming,88,5,(They will be) offered to drink (water) from a boiling spring.
The Overwhelming,88,6,They will have no food except thorny and dry venomous herbage.
The Overwhelming,88,7,(This food) will neither nourish nor gratify hunger.
The Overwhelming,88,8,"(On the contrary) that Day a number of faces will be (pleasing to the eye,) glowing with joy and freshness,"
The Overwhelming,88,9,"Delighted and rejoicing over their (righteous) travail,"
The Overwhelming,88,10,"(Abiding) in a magnificent Paradise,"
The Overwhelming,88,11,Where they will not hear anything absurd (as the disbelievers used to say to them in the world).
The Overwhelming,88,12,"In it there will be flowing springs,"
The Overwhelming,88,13,"And raised-up couches (laid),"
The Overwhelming,88,14,"And goblets (decently) set in place,"
The Overwhelming,88,15,"And silken cushions orderly lined up,"
The Overwhelming,88,16,And soft and refined carpets and rugs (richly) spread.
The Overwhelming,88,17,(The disbelievers wonder how all that would be arranged in Paradise. So) do they not see how the camel has been created (in an unusual form)?
The Overwhelming,88,18,And (do they not observe) how the heaven is raised so high (with its vast expanse)?
The Overwhelming,88,19,And (do they not see) how the mountains have been created (raised out of the earth)?
The Overwhelming,88,20,(Nor do they consider) how the earth has been spread out (besides its round shape)?
The Overwhelming,88,21,"So, continuously admonish them, for you are but an admonisher,"
The Overwhelming,88,22,You are not imposed upon them (as) an oppressor and persecutor.
The Overwhelming,88,23,"But anyone who turns away and becomes a disbeliever,"
The Overwhelming,88,24,Allah will torment him with the greatest punishment.
The Overwhelming,88,25,"Indeed, it is to Us that they will return (in the end);"
The Overwhelming,88,26,"Then, surely, it is Our concern to call them to account."
The Dawn,89,1,"By the emerging dawn (that dispels the darkness of night),*"
The Dawn,89,2,"And by the ten (blessed) nights,*"
The Dawn,89,3,"And by the even and the odd,*"
The Dawn,89,4,And by the night as it departs. (Every night or particularly the night of Muzdalifa or the night of Qadr.)
The Dawn,89,5,"Surely, in that is a mighty oath for the wise."
The Dawn,89,6,Have you not seen how your Lord treated (the people of ‘Ad)?
The Dawn,89,7,"(They) were (the people) of Iram (and) were (tall like) lofty columns (possessing towering castles),"
The Dawn,89,8,The like of which has not (at all) been created in the countries (of the world).
The Dawn,89,9,"And (what treatment was given to) Thamud, who carved rocks (and constructed hundreds of cities) in the (Qura) valley?"
The Dawn,89,10,"And (how was) Pharaoh (dealt with), who wielded large armies (and used to punish victims with stakes)?"
The Dawn,89,11,"(They were) the people who perpetrated tyranny in their (respective) countries,"
The Dawn,89,12,And spread great mischief and corruption there.
The Dawn,89,13,Then your Lord unleashed the scourge of punishment on them.
The Dawn,89,14,"Indeed, your Lord is Ever-Watchful (over the tyrant transgressors)."
The Dawn,89,15,"But as for man, when his Lord tests him (by providing him pleasure and comfort) and honours him and gives him bounties, he says: ‘My Lord has honoured me.’"
The Dawn,89,16,"But when He tries him (by afflicting him with pain and discomfort) and limits his means of sustenance, he says: ‘My Lord has humiliated me.’"
The Dawn,89,17,"No indeed! But (the truth is that after you gain honour and good fortune), you do not give honour and care to orphans."
The Dawn,89,18,"Nor do you inspire one another (in society) to promote the feeding of the destitute (i.e., the poor and the needy)."
The Dawn,89,19,And you lay hand on the inherited wealth and devour it (yourselves and do not pay the poverty-stricken their due).
The Dawn,89,20,And you love wealth and riches inordinately.
The Dawn,89,21,"Assuredly, when the earth will be cleft asunder and crushed to dust particles,"
The Dawn,89,22,"And your Lord will unveil His Light and the angels will appear (before His presence) rank upon rank,"
The Dawn,89,23,"And that Day, Hell will be brought forth. On that Day man will come to understand, but how will admonition (avail him then)?"
The Dawn,89,24,He will say: ‘Would that I had sent (something) ahead of me for my (real) life (which would have helped me Today)!’
The Dawn,89,25,"But that Day no one will be able to torment like His torment,"
The Dawn,89,26,And no one will be able to bind as He binds.
The Dawn,89,27,O contented (pleased) self!
The Dawn,89,28,"Return to your Lord in such a state that you are both the aspirant to, and the aspired of, His pleasure (i.e., you seek His pleasure and He seeks yours)."
The Dawn,89,29,So join My (perfect) servants.
The Dawn,89,30,And enter My Paradise (of nearness and sight).
The City,90,1,"I swear by this city (Mecca),"
The City,90,2,"(O My Esteemed Beloved,) because you are residing in it.*"
The City,90,3,"(O My Esteemed Beloved!) By (your) father (Adam or Ibrahim [Abraham]) and by those who are born,*"
The City,90,4,"Indeed, We have created man (ever suffering) in rigours."
The City,90,5,Does he think that no one can ever overpower him?
The City,90,6,"(Boasting,) he says: ‘I have spent heaps of wealth.’"
The City,90,7,Does he think that no one has seen him (making this extravagant spending)?
The City,90,8,Have We not made for him two eyes?
The City,90,9,And (have We not given him) a tongue and two lips?
The City,90,10,And (have We also not) shown him the two highways (of good and evil)?
The City,90,11,But he has not yet attempted the steep ascent (of the Din [Religion]) of truth and the practical life dedicated to good and piety).
The City,90,12,And what have you thought of the steep ascent (of the rigours of the Din [Religion] of truth)?
The City,90,13,"It is freeing a neck (from slavery and subjugation),"
The City,90,14,"Or feeding on a day of scarcity (the poor and the needy during famine and scarcity i.e., striving to put an end to their sufferings and economic crises),"
The City,90,15,"The orphaned relative,"
The City,90,16,Or the poverty-stricken destitute who is completely rundown (and homeless).
The City,90,17,(Provided this striving soul is) one of those who believe and advise one another patience and tolerance and urge one another for mutual affection and mercy.
The City,90,18,"These are the people of the Right Hand (i.e., the privileged and the pardoned)."
The City,90,19,And those who reject Our signs are the people of the Left Hand (the callous and the doomed).
The City,90,20,Fire will be enclosed upon them (covering from all sides).
The Sun,91,1,"By the sun and by its brightness,"
The Sun,91,2,"And by the moon when it follows the sun (i.e., reflects sunshine),"
The Sun,91,3,"And by the day when it displays the sun (i.e., brings it forth shining),"
The Sun,91,4,"And by the night when it draws a veil over the sun (from one of the hemispheres of the earth),"
The Sun,91,5,"And by the heaven and by that (energy) which built it (with Allah’s permission in the form of a vast universe),"
The Sun,91,6,"And by the earth and by that (force which, by Allah’s command,) pulled it (from the sun far) apart."
The Sun,91,7,"And by the human soul and by the One Who provided it with an all-dimensional poise, proportion and perfection,"
The Sun,91,8,"Then He inspired it with (discrimination between) vice and virtue,"
The Sun,91,9,"Indeed, the one who purifies his (ill-commanding) self (from all vain and vicious desires and cultivates in it virtue and piousness) succeeds,"
The Sun,91,10,But the one who corrupts himself (in sins and suppresses virtue) is doomed indeed.
The Sun,91,11,The people of Thamud rejected (their Messenger Salih) due to their rebellion.
The Sun,91,12,"When the most wretched of them stood up,"
The Sun,91,13,Allah’s Messenger said to them: ‘Guard (that) she-camel and (the time of) her taking water.’
The Sun,91,14,"But they rejected the Messenger and hamstrung (the she-camel). So because of their sin, their Lord sent down destruction on them, and levelled (them all in the torment devastating) the town."
The Sun,91,15,And Allah does not fear any repercussions of this (devastation).
The Night,92,1,"By the night when it covers up (and conceals everything in its darkness),"
The Night,92,2,"And by the day when it brightens up,"
The Night,92,3,"And by that Being Who created male and female (in everything),"
The Night,92,4,"Indeed, your striving is different (and singular)."
The Night,92,5,"So he who gives away (his wealth in the way of Allah) and commits himself to piousness,"
The Night,92,6,"And affirms the good (the Din [Religion]) of truth and life after death through charity and Godwariness),"
The Night,92,7,Soon We shall facilitate him in seeking (Allah’s pleasure) with ease.
The Night,92,8,"But he who is miser and disregards (spending in the cause of Allah),"
The Night,92,9,"And (in this way) denies the good (the Din [Religion]) of truth and afterlife),"
The Night,92,10,"Soon shall We facilitate his landing into hardship (advancing towards torment, so that punishment becomes his rightful due)."
The Night,92,11,And his wealth will not help him any way when he falls into (the pit of) destruction.
The Night,92,12,"Indeed, it is binding on Us to show you the path (of truth)."
The Night,92,13,"And indeed, We are the Master of the Hereafter and the world."
The Night,92,14,So I have warned you of the raging Fire (of Hell).
The Night,92,15,"No one shall enter it but the most wretched,"
The Night,92,16,He who gives lie to (the Din [Religion] of truth) and turns away (from obedience to the Messenger [blessings and peace be upon him]).
The Night,92,17,"But the most pious one shall be saved from this (Fire),"
The Night,92,18,"Who gives his wealth away (in the cause of Allah) to attain to purity (of his soul and assets),"
The Night,92,19,And who owes no favour to anyone that he is seeking to pay back.
The Night,92,20,"Rather (he spends) seeking the pleasure of his Lord, Most High."
The Night,92,21,And soon shall he be well-pleased (with Allah for His bestowal and Allah with him for his fidelity).
The Morning Hours,93,1,"By the growing morning bright (when the sun gains height and spreads its radiance), Or (O My Esteemed Beloved,) I swear by (your holy face glowing like) the growing morning bright, (the radiant face, whose effulgence has illumined the dark souls,) Or By (the growing sunshine of your Messengership rising like) the morning bright (whose radiance has replaced the darkness of ignorance with the enlightenment of guidance,)"
The Morning Hours,93,2,"And by the night when it covers up, Or (O My Esteemed Beloved,) I swear by (your fragrant tresses spread like) the sprawling murky night (over your effulgent face and shoulders,) Or By (the veil of your essence that is keeping under layered covers your real nucleus of radiance like) the dark night when it envelops,"
The Morning Hours,93,3,"(Ever since He has chosen you,) your Lord has not forsaken you. Nor is He displeased (ever since He has taken you as His Beloved)."
The Morning Hours,93,4,"Indeed, every following hour is a better (source of eminence and exaltation) for you than the preceding one."
The Morning Hours,93,5,And soon your Lord shall bestow upon you (so much) that you will be well-pleased.
The Morning Hours,93,6,"(O Beloved!) Did He not find you an orphan, and then provided you (a dignifying and graceful) abode? Or Did He not find you (compassionate) and provided (in your person) a shelter for orphans?"
The Morning Hours,93,7,And He found you engrossed and lost in His love and then made you achieve the coveted objective. Or And He found in you (a leader) for a straying people so He provided them guidance (through you).
The Morning Hours,93,8,"And He found you seeking (closeness with your Lord), and (then blessed you with the pleasure of His sight and) freed you of every need (forever). Or And He found you compassionate and benevolent, then (through you) made the destitute non-liable."
The Morning Hours,93,9,"So, never should you be strict with any orphan,"
The Morning Hours,93,10,"Nor reproach any beggar (seeking help at your door),"
The Morning Hours,93,11,And proclaim (well) the bounties of your Lord.
Solace,94,1,"Have We not broadened your breast for you (for the light of knowledge, wisdom and spiritual gnosis)?"
Solace,94,2,"And We have taken off the load (of grief of the Umma [Community]) from you,"
Solace,94,3,(The load) which was growing heavier on your (holy) back.
Solace,94,4,And We exalted for you your remembrance (by annexing it to Ours everywhere in the world and in the Hereafter).
Solace,94,5,So surely ease (comes) with every hardship.
Solace,94,6,"Verily, with (this) hardship (too) there is ease."
Solace,94,7,"So when you are free (from educating the Umma (Community), preaching the Din (Religion) and fighting, and fulfilling your responsibilities), then strive hard (in remembrance and the worship of your Lord),"
Solace,94,8,And turn to your Lord earnestly.
The Fig,95,1,By the fig and by the olive!
The Fig,95,2,And by (Mount) Tur of Sinai!
The Fig,95,3,And by this city of peace (Mecca)!
The Fig,95,4,"Indeed, We have created man in the best constitution (equipoised in the finest proportion)."
The Fig,95,5,"Then We returned him to the lowest state of the low,"
The Fig,95,6,"Except for those who believe and do good works. For them is an unending (i.e., everlasting) reward."
The Fig,95,7,Then who denies you after this regarding the Din (Religion or the Last Hour and reward and punishment)?
The Fig,95,8,Is Allah not the Greatest of all the rulers?
The Clot,96,1,"(O Beloved!) Read (commencing) with the Name of Allah, Who has created (everything)."
The Clot,96,2,He created man from a hanging mass (clinging) like a leech (to the mother’s womb).
The Clot,96,3,"Read, and your Lord is Most Generous,"
The Clot,96,4,"Who taught man (reading and writing) by the pen,"
The Clot,96,5,Who (besides that) taught man (all that) which he did not know. Or Who imparted to (the most eminent of) mankind (the chosen Prophet Muhammad [blessings and peace be upon him] without using any pen) the whole knowledge that he was not aware of before.
The Clot,96,6,"(But) the fact is that (the disobedient) man rebels,"
The Clot,96,7,For the reason that (apparently) he finds himself self-sufficient (in the world).
The Clot,96,8,"Surely, (every man) has to return to your Lord."
The Clot,96,9,"Have you seen him who prevents,"
The Clot,96,10,The servant (of Allah) when he prays? Or The (beloved and the exalted) servant of Allah (Muhammad [blessings and peace be upon him]) when he offers Prayers.
The Clot,96,11,"Well, imagine! If he had been rightly guided;"
The Clot,96,12,Or if he had commanded (the people) to be pious (how beneficial it would have been)!
The Clot,96,13,"But see now when he has rejected (the true Din [Religion]) and has turned away (from you, what torment is he going to face?)"
The Clot,96,14,Does he not know that Allah monitors (minutely all his conduct)?
The Clot,96,15,"Beware! If he does not desist (from the denigration of the Holy Prophet [blessings and peace be upon him] and antagonism against the true Din [Religion]), We shall certainly grab his forehead and drag him by the forelock,"
The Clot,96,16,His lying (and) sinful forehead!
The Clot,96,17,Then let him call his companions (for help).
The Clot,96,18,We too shall soon call (Our) guards (the angels appointed to inflict the punishment of Hell).
The Clot,96,19,"No indeed! Do not pay any heed to his doings and, (O Esteemed Beloved,) persist in prostration and keep drawing near (to Us more and more)."
Power,97,1,"Surely, We sent down this (Holy Qur’an) during the Night of Destiny."
Power,97,2,And what have you made out what the Night of Destiny is?
Power,97,3,"The Night of Destiny is better than a thousand months (in merit, blessings, reward and recompense)."
Power,97,4,The angels and the Spirit of Peace (Gabriel) descend by their Lord’s command during this (night) with decrees concerning all matters (of blessings and bounties).
Power,97,5,This (night) is (absolute) peace and security till daybreak.
The Clear Proof,98,1,The disbelievers from amongst the People of the Book and the idolaters would not desist (from disbelief) until clear proof came to them.
The Clear Proof,98,2,"That (proof) is the (last) Messenger from Allah, who recites (to them) holy pages (of the Glorious Qur’an),"
The Clear Proof,98,3,In which are (written) correct and firm commandments.
The Clear Proof,98,4,"These People of the Book did not dissent amongst themselves (with regard to believing in the Prophethood and Messengership of the Last Messenger and recognizing his holy status), until after the clear proof (of the Prophethood of Muhammad [blessings and peace be upon him]) had come to them. (Then, they broke up: some of them accepted belief in him whilst others became deniers and disbelievers out of jealousy,)"
The Clear Proof,98,5,"Whereas they were commanded to worship only Allah, making their Din (faith and devotion) sincerely His (dissociating from every falsehood) to establish Prayer and to pay Zakat (the Alms-due) regularly. And this is the straight and firm Din (Religion)."
The Clear Proof,98,6,"Indeed, those who disbelieve from amongst the People of the Book and the polytheists (all) will be (abiding) in the Fire of Hell. They are its permanent dwellers. It is they who are the worst of the creation."
The Clear Proof,98,7,"Indeed, those who believe and keep doing pious actions, it is they who are the best of the creation."
The Clear Proof,98,8,"Their reward is the Gardens of eternal living in the presence of their Lord, with streams flowing under them. They will live in them forever. Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him. This (status) is meant for the one who fears his Lord."
The Earthquake,99,1,"When the earth will be violently shaken with a high-scale quake,"
The Earthquake,99,2,"And when the earth will throw out (all) her burdens,"
The Earthquake,99,3,And man (bewildered and baffled) will say: ‘What has happened to her?’
The Earthquake,99,4,"On that Day, she will herself bring to light her experiences,"
The Earthquake,99,5,For your Lord will have made subservient to her (the symbolic language of) sharp signals.
The Earthquake,99,6,"On that Day, people will form up in different groups, (in diverse conditions,) so that they may be shown their works."
The Earthquake,99,7,Then he who will have done even an atom’s weight of good will see it.
The Earthquake,99,8,And he who will have done even an atom’s weight of evil will (also) see it.
The Coursers,100,1,"By the charging horses that gallop (in the battlefield) and pant,"
The Coursers,100,2,"And those that produce sparks striking their hoofs on rocks,"
The Coursers,100,3,"Then they attack (the enemy) at dawn,"
The Coursers,100,4,"And then raise clouds of dust from the point (of attack),"
The Coursers,100,5,"And then simultaneously pierce into (the enemy) ranks,"
The Coursers,100,6,"Indeed, man is most ungrateful to his Lord,"
The Coursers,100,7,"And verily, he is himself a witness to this ingratitude."
The Coursers,100,8,"And indeed, he is quite stubborn in his love of wealth."
The Coursers,100,9,"But does he not know when those (dead) in the graves will be raised,"
The Coursers,100,10,And secrets which are in hearts will be disclosed?
The Coursers,100,11,"Indeed, their Lord will be Well Aware of their (deeds) on that Day."
The Calamity,101,1,The high-scale jolt rocking (the whole universe of the heavens and the earth) and thunder!
The Calamity,101,2,And what is that high-scale jolt rocking (everything) and that thunder?
The Calamity,101,3,And what have you made out what the high-scale jolt and thunder implies?
The Calamity,101,4,"(It implies) the Day of Resurrection when (the whole of) mankind will become like scattered moths,"
The Calamity,101,5,And the mountains will be like multicoloured carded wool.
The Calamity,101,6,"So he whose scales of deeds in the balance will be heavy,"
The Calamity,101,7,He will be in luxury and delight.
The Calamity,101,8,"But as for him whose scales of deeds in the balance will be light,"
The Calamity,101,9,His abode will be Hawiya (a pit in Hell)!
The Calamity,101,10,And what have you made out what that (Hawiya) is?
The Calamity,101,11,It is (an extremely deep pit of) the fiercely Blazing Fire (of Hell).
Rivalry in Worldly Increase,102,1,"Your greed for massive wealth and the superiority complex has made you negligent (of the Hereafter),"
Rivalry in Worldly Increase,102,2,Until you go down to the graves.
Rivalry in Worldly Increase,102,3,No indeed! You will soon learn (this reality that wealth and riches will avail you nothing).
Rivalry in Worldly Increase,102,4,Again (you are warned.) No! Never! You will soon learn about (your end).
Rivalry in Worldly Increase,102,5,"Yes indeed! Would that you knew with the knowledge of certitude (the consequence of greed for wealth and riches and your negligence! Then, lost in the worldly pleasures, you would never forget the Hereafter like this)."
Rivalry in Worldly Increase,102,6,(Consequent on your greed) you will surely see Hell.
Rivalry in Worldly Increase,102,7,Then you will certainly see it with the eye of certitude.
Rivalry in Worldly Increase,102,8,"Then on that Day, you will certainly be questioned about the bounties (given to you by Allah and the way you consumed them)."
The Declining Day,103,1,"By the passing time (whose rotation bears witness to the affairs of mankind). Or By the Prayer of declining day (‘Asr, for this Prayer is the middle of all Prayers). Or By the declining time of the day, (when the sun, after shining for the whole day, presents the sight of its setting). Or By the holy era of the Prophethood of Muhammad (blessings and peace be upon him), the sole objective and the most coveted achievement of all ages historic as well as pre-historic, and of all times to come."
The Declining Day,103,2,"Indeed, man is at a loss (for he is losing his valuable lifetime),"
The Declining Day,103,3,Except for those who believe and do good deeds and exhort one another to truth and exhort one another to patience (in the face of hardships and afflictions that are faced whilst preaching the Din [Religion] of truth).
The Traducer,104,1,Woe to everyone who slanders (face to face) and finds fault (in absence)!
The Traducer,104,2,(Woe to him) who accumulates wealth and keeps counting it!
The Traducer,104,3,He thinks that his riches will keep him alive forever.
The Traducer,104,4,By no means! He will certainly be cast into al-Hutama (the crushing up Fire).
The Traducer,104,5,And what will make you understand what al-Hutama (the crushing up Fire) is?
The Traducer,104,6,(It) is a Fire kindled by Allah.
The Traducer,104,7,That will rise over the hearts (with its torture).
The Traducer,104,8,"Indeed, that (Fire) will be closed upon them all around,"
The Traducer,104,9,In towering columns (of fierce flames and they will not find any way to escape).
The Elephant,105,1,Have you not seen how your Lord dealt with those who had elephants?
The Elephant,105,2,Did He not thwart their crafty designs?
The Elephant,105,3,"And He sent on to them (ambient) swarms of birds,"
The Elephant,105,4,Which pelted them with stone-hard slugs.
The Elephant,105,5,Then (Allah made them perish) like chewed-up chaff.
Winter or Qureysh,106,1,"To awake drive amongst the Quraysh,"
Winter or Qureysh,106,2,They were acclimatized to the summer and winter (commercial) trips.
Winter or Qureysh,106,3,"So they should worship the Lord of this (Sacred) House (Ka‘ba, to give Him thanks),"
Winter or Qureysh,106,4,"Who has fed them in hunger (i.e., provided them sustenance in starving conditions) and secured them from fear (of foes i.e., blessed them with secure and peaceful life)."
Small Kindnesses,107,1,Have you seen him who denies the Din (Religion)?
Small Kindnesses,107,2,"So he is the one who pushes away the orphan (i.e., rejects the needs of the orphans and deprives them of their right),"
