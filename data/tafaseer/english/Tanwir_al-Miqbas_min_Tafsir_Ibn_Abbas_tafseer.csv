Arabic,Tafseer
بِسمِ ٱلله الرَّحْمٰنِ الرَّحِيـمِ,"In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful."
ٱلْحَمْدُ للَّهِ رَبِّ ٱلْعَالَمِينَ,"And on his authority it is related that Ibn 'Abbas said, regarding the saying of Allah, Exalted is He, (Praise be to Allah): 'He says: laudation is Allah's in that He is kind towards His created beings and, hence, they praise Him. It is also said that laudation is Allah's because of His excessive blessings upon His servants whom He has guided to believe in Him. It is also said: laudation, absolute unity and godhood all belong to Allah Who has neither progeny, partner, helper nor an assistant. (Lord of the worlds): Lord of any that has a spirit and walks about on the face of the earth and also of the dwellers of heaven. It is also said that this means: the Master of the jinn and human beings. It is also said that (Lord of the worlds) means the Creator of all created beings, their Provider and the One Who changes them from one state into another."
ٱلرَّحْمـٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ,(The Beneficent) the Gentle. (The Merciful) the Gentle.
مَـٰلِكِ يَوْمِ ٱلدِّينِ,"(Owner of the Day of Judgement) the Arbitrator on the Day of Judgement which is the Day of Reckoning and settlement of disputes between created beings, i.e. the Day when people are judged according to their deeds; there is no judge save Him."
إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ,"(Thee (alone) we worship), we turn to you as the only One God and we obey you; ((Thee alone) we ask for help), we ask for your help in worshipping You and from You we obtain confidence in obeying You."
ٱهْدِنَا ٱلصِّرَاطَ ٱلْمُسْتَقِيمَ,"(Guide us to the straight path) guide us to the established Religion that You are pleased with, i.e. Islam. It is also said that this means: make us firm in holding fast to it. It is also said that the straight path refers to Allah's Book, and guidance to this means guidance to that which it prescribes as lawful or unlawful and to the exposition of its content."
صِرَاطَ ٱلَّذِينَ أَنْعَمْتَ عَلَيْهِمْ غَيْرِ ٱلْمَغْضُوبِ عَلَيْهِم وَلاَ ٱلضَّآلِّينَ,"(The path of those whom Thou hast favoured), the Religion of those whom You have blessed with the Religion and who are the followers of Moses, before the blessings of Allah deserted them, in that He shaded them with a white cloud and sent down on them honey and quails when they were in the wilderness. It is also said that (the path of those whom Thou hast favoured) refers to the prophets. (Not of those who earn Thine anger), not the religion of the Jews who earned Your anger, whom You forsook and whose hearts You did not protect until they became complaisant. (Nor of those who go astray), nor the religion of the Christians who erred from Islam. Amen: thus shall be its custodians; it is also said that Amen means let it be so. It is also said that it means: O our Lord! Do with us as we have requested You. And Allah knows best'."
الۤـمۤ,"And on his authority>'Abdullah ibn al-Mubarak>'Ali Ibn Ishaq al-Samarqandi>Muhammad Ibn Marwan>al-Kalbi>Abu Salih that Ibn 'Abbas said, concerning Allah's saying, Exalted is He, (Alif. Lam. Mim): 'Alif stands for Allah, Lam for the Archangel Gabriel (Jibril) and Mim for Muhammad. It is also said Alif stands for Allah's blessings (ala'uh), Lam for His kindness (lutfuh) and Mim for His dominion (mulkuh). It is also said that Alif stands for the beginning of the Name Allah, Lam for the beginning of His Name the Kind (al-Latif) and Mim for the beginning of His Name the Glorious (al-Majid). It is also said that only Allah knows the meaning of these disjointed letters; while some maintain that it is an oath that He made."
ذَلِكَ ٱلْكِتَابُ لاَ رَيْبَ فِيهِ هُدًى لِّلْمُتَّقِينَ,"(This is the Scripture), i.e. this is the Book that Muhammad (pbuh) is reciting to you; (whereof there is no doubt). There is no doubt that it has come from Me; if you believe in it, I shall guide you, but if you do not believe in it, I will torment you. It is also said that (This is the Scripture) refers to the Guarded Tablet. It is also said that this means: This is the Book that I promised to reveal to you on the Day of the Covenant (yawm al-mithaq). It is also said (this is the Scripture whereof there is no doubt) means there is no doubt that the description and traits of Muhammad are found in the Torah and Gospel. (A guidance unto those who ward off (evil)), means that the Qur'an is an exposition for those who ward off disbelief, associating partners with Allah and indecencies. It is also said that it means: it is a favour to the believers; or that it means it is a mercy unto those who ward off evil from among the community of Muhammad (pbuh)."
ٱلَّذِينَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱلْغَيْبِ وَيُقِيمُونَ ٱلصَّلٰوةَ وَممَّا رَزَقْنَاهُمْ يُنْفِقُونَ,"(Who believe in the unseen), that which is hidden from them such as Paradise, hell, the Bridge over hell, the Scale, the Resurrection, the Reckoning, etc. It is also said that this means: that they believe in the unseen which is revealed in the Qur'an and also in that which is not revealed therein. It is also said that the unseen is Allah Himself. (And establish worship), they perform to completion the five prescribed prayers, including the ablution that precedes them, the bowing and prostrations which are parts of them and also what is obligated in these prayers in terms of appointed timing. (And spend of that We have bestowed upon them), and of that which We have given them of wealth they give to charity. It is also said that this means: they give the poor-due (Zakat) from their wealth. The reference here is to Abu Bakr and his companions."
وٱلَّذِينَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِمَآ أُنْزِلَ إِلَيْكَ وَمَآ أُنْزِلَ مِن قَبْلِكَ وَبِٱلآخِرَةِ هُمْ يُوقِنُونَ,"(And who believe in that which is revealed unto thee (Muhammad)) of the Qur'an (and that which was revealed before you) of scriptures given to all the prophets, (and are certain of the Hereafter), they believe in resurrection after death and in the bliss of Paradise, referring here specifically to 'Abdullah Ibn Salam and his followers."
أُوْلَـٰئِكَ عَلَىٰ هُدًى مِّن رَّبِّهِمْ وَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْمُفْلِحُونَ,"(These) who have these traits, (are on guidance from their Lord), they enjoy favour, mercy and clear exposition that has come down from their Lord, (and these are the successful ones), the ones who shall escape Allah's wrath and torment. It is also said that this refers to those who have apprehended and found what they were seeking and have escaped the evil of that from which they were fleeing, and these are the Companions of Muhammad (pbuh)."
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ سَوَآءٌ عَلَيْهِمْ ءَأَنذَرْتَهُمْ أَمْ لَمْ تُنْذِرْهُمْ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ,"(As for the disbelievers) who remain firm in their disbelief, (whether thou warn them), instil fear into them by means of the Qur'an, (or thou warm them not) or you do not instil fear into them, (it is all one for them; they believe not), they do not want to believe. It is also said that they will not believe as it is in Allah's knowledge."
خَتَمَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ قُلُوبِهمْ وَعَلَىٰ سَمْعِهِمْ وَعَلَىٰ أَبْصَٰرِهِمْ غِشَاوَةٌ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ عظِيمٌ,"(Allah hath sealed their hearts), stamped their hearts, (and their hearing, and on their eyes there is a covering), on their eyes there is a shield (and theirs will be an awful doom) an awful torment in the Hereafter. This refers in particular to the Jews Ka'b Ibn al-Ashraf, Huyayy Ibn Akhtab and Judayy Ibn Akhtab. It is also said that it refers to the idolaters of Mecca 'Utbah [Ibn Rabi'ah], Shaybah [Ibn Rabi'ah] and al-Walid [Ibn al-Mughirah]."
وَمِنَ ٱلنَّاسِ مَن يَقُولُ آمَنَّا بِٱللَّهِ وَبِٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلآخِرِ وَمَا هُم بِمُؤْمِنِينَ,"(And of mankind are some who say: We believe in Allah), i.e. in the open and we are genuine in our belief, (and the last Day) and we believe in resurrection after death whereupon our deeds shall be requited, (when they believe not) i.e. secretly nor are they genuine in their belief."
يُخَادِعُونَ ٱللَّهَ وَٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَمَا يَخْدَعُونَ إِلاَّ أَنْفُسَهُم وَمَا يَشْعُرُونَ,"(They try to deceive Allah) contravene against Him and denying Him in secret. It is also said that this means that they were so daring with Allah to the extent that they thought they had deceived Him; (and those who believe), Abu Bakr and all the Companions of Muhammad Allah bless him and give him peace; (and they deceive) lie to (none save themselves; but they perceive not), they do not know that Allah informs His Prophet about that which lies secret in their hearts."
فِي قُلُوبِهِم مَّرَضٌ فَزَادَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ مَرَضاً وَلَهُم عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ بِمَا كَانُوا يَكْذِبُونَ,"(In their hearts is a disease), doubt, hypocrisy, conflict and darkness (so Allah increaseth their disease), increased their doubt, hypocrisy, conflict and darkness. (And a painful doom is theirs), they will have a painful torment in the Hereafter which shall extend to their hearts, (because they lie) in secret, the reference here being to the hypocrites: 'Abdullah ibn Ubayy, Jadd Ibn Qays and Mu'attib Ibn Qushayr."
وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمْ لاَ تُفْسِدُواْ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ قَالُوۤاْ إِنَّمَا نَحْنُ مُصْلِحُونَ,"(And when it is said unto them), i.e. the Jews (Make not mischief in the land) by preventing people from the Religion of Muhammad (pbuh) (they say: we are reformers only), we are reforming it through obedience."
أَلاۤ إِنَّهُمْ هُمُ ٱلْمُفْسِدُونَ وَلَـٰكِن لاَّ يَشْعُرُونَ,(They are indeed the mischief mongers) by being a hindrance. (But they perceive not): the followers do not know that their leaders mislead them.
وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمْ آمِنُواْ كَمَآ آمَنَ ٱلنَّاسُ قَالُوۤاْ أَنُؤْمِنُ كَمَآ آمَنَ ٱلسُّفَهَآءُ أَلاۤ إِنَّهُمْ هُمُ ٱلسُّفَهَآءُ وَلَـٰكِن لاَّ يَعْلَمُونَ,"(And when it is said unto them) i.e. to Jews, (believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) (as the people believe), i.e. 'Abdullah Ibn Salam and his companions, (they say: Shall we believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an, (as the foolish believe?), i.e. as the stupid and ignorant do, (Surely they are the fools) the stupid and ignorant. (But they know not) that they are so."
وَإِذَا لَقُواْ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ قَالُوۤا آمَنَّا وَإِذَا خَلَوْاْ إِلَىٰ شَيَاطِينِهِمْ قَالُوۤاْ إِنَّا مَعَكُمْ إِنَّمَا نَحْنُ مُسْتَهْزِءُونَ,"(And when they), i.e. the hypocrites, (fall in with those who believe), i.e. Abu Bakr and his companions, (they say: We believe) deep in our hearts and are genuine in our faith just as you believe deep in your hearts and are genuine in your faith; (but when they go apart to their devils), to their soothsayers and leaders who were five in number, namely, Ka'b Ibn al-Ashraf in Medina, Abu Burdah al-Aslami in Banu Aslam, Ibn al-Sawda' in Historic Syria (al-Sham), 'Abd al-Dar in Juhaynah and 'Awf Ibn 'Amir in Banu 'Amir, (they declare) to their leaders: (Lo! We are with you) we follow your religion in secret; (surely we did but mock) Muhammad (pbuh) and his Companions."
ٱللَّهُ يَسْتَهْزِئُ بِهِمْ وَيَمُدُّهُمْ فِي طُغْيَانِهِمْ يَعْمَهُونَ,"(Allah (Himself) doth mock them), in the Hereafter, i.e. He will open a gate of Paradise for them and then shut it before their eyes and so the believers will mock them. (Leaving them to wander blindly on in their contumacy) He will leave them in this world blind in their disbelief and error, unable to see either faith or guidance."
أُوْلَـٰئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱشْتَرَوُاْ ٱلضَّلَـٰلَةَ بِٱلْهُدَىٰ فَمَا رَبِحَتْ تِّجَارَتُهُمْ وَمَا كَانُواْ مُهْتَدِينَ,"(These are they who purchase error at the price of guidance), they chose disbelief instead of faith and exchanged guidance with error, (so their commerce did not prosper), they did not prosper in their bargain but on the contrary (neither were they guided) to overcome their error."
مَثَلُهُمْ كَمَثَلِ ٱلَّذِي ٱسْتَوْقَدَ نَاراً فَلَمَّآ أَضَآءَتْ مَا حَوْلَهُ ذَهَبَ ٱللَّهُ بِنُورِهِمْ وَتَرَكَهُمْ فِي ظُلُمَٰتٍ لاَّ يُبْصِرُونَ,"(Their likeness), the likeness of the hypocrites vis-à-vis Muhammad (pbuh) (is as the likeness of one who kindleth fire), lights a fire in the darkness in order to provide safety for his family, property and person, (and when it sheddeth its light around him), when it sheds its light and he sees what is around him and feels secure, at that very moment the Fire is put out. Likewise, the hypocrites believed openly in Muhammad (pbuh) as well as in the Qur'an and by doing so they felt their persons, families and properties were safe, avoiding in the process imprisonment or death. But when they die (Allah taketh away their light), the benefit of their [outward] faith, (and leaveth them in darkness) facing the hardships of the grave, (where they cannot see) any comfort. It is also said this simile refers to the Jews. In this respect, the likeness of the Jews vis-à-vis Muhammad (pbuh) is like a man who raises a flag in a lost battle and by doing so attracts other defeated fighters. But when they gather they put their flag down and, consequently, their benefit and safety immediately vanish. Similarly, the Jews used to say that Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an, prior to its revelation, would support them. When it was revealed however they denied it and Allah took away their light, i.e. their desire to believe and the benefit of such belief. This is because although they wanted to believe in Muhammad (pbuh) they did not do so, and consequently they were left them in the error of Judaism, unable to see guidance."
صُمٌّ بُكْمٌ عُمْيٌ فَهُمْ لاَ يَرْجِعُونَ,"(Deaf) pretending to be deaf, (dumb) pretending to be dumb, (and blind) pretending to be blind; (so they return not) from their disbelief and error."
أَوْ كَصَيِّبٍ مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ فِيهِ ظُلُمَٰتٌ وَرَعْدٌ وَبَرْقٌ يَجْعَلُونَ أَصَٰبِعَهُمْ فِيۤ آذَانِهِم مِّنَ ٱلصَّوَٰعِقِ حَذَرَ ٱلْمَوْتِ وٱللَّهُ مُحِيطٌ بِٱلْكَٰفِرِينَ,"(Or like a rainstorm from the sky). This is another simile, whereby the likeness of the hypocrites and Jews vis-à-vis the Qur'an is like rain that has poured down from heaven at night onto the wilderness, (wherein is darkness, thunder and the flash of lightening). Such is the Qur'an. For it has come down from Allah; it contains darkness as embodied in the exposition of seditions, thunderings of rebuke whereby fear is instilled, lightening of exposition, instruction and promise. (They thrust their fingers in their ears by reason of the thunder-claps) due to the sound of the thunder (for fear of death), for fear of misfortune and death. Similarly, the Jews and hypocrites used to put their fingers in their ears when they heard the Qur'an recited, delivering promises and threats like thunder-claps, and this they did for fear of death, i.e. for fear of being drawn to it. (And Allah encompasseth the disbelievers) and hypocrites, i.e. He knows them and will gather them in hell."
يَكَادُ ٱلْبَرْقُ يَخْطَفُ أَبْصَٰرَهُمْ كُلَّمَا أَضَآءَ لَهُمْ مَّشَوْاْ فِيهِ وَإِذَآ أَظْلَمَ عَلَيْهِمْ قَامُواْ وَلَوْ شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ لَذَهَبَ بِسَمْعِهِمْ وَأَبْصَٰرِهِمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,"(The lightning), i.e. fire, (almost snatcheth away their sight from them), i.e. from the unbelievers. Similarly, the exposition of the Qur'an almost snatched away their error. (As often as it flasheth forth), the lightening, (for them they walk therein) in the brightness of lightening, (and when it darkeneth against them they stand still) they remain in darkness. Likewise, when the hypocrites declared themselves to be believers, they went along with that which the believers went along with because their outward faith was accepted. But when they died, they remained in the darkness of the grave. (And if Allah willed, He could destroy their hearing), take away the thunder, (and their sight) the lightening. Likewise, if Allah willed, He could take away the hearing of the hypocrites and Jews through the rebukes and threats contained in the Qur'an, and He could also take away their sight through the exposition contained therein. (Indeed Allah is able to do all things) in terms of destroying their hearing and sight."
يَٰـأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّاسُ ٱعْبُدُواْ رَبَّكُمُ ٱلَّذِي خَلَقَكُمْ وَٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ,"(O mankind!) O people of Mecca; and it is also said that this refers to the Jews, (Worship your Lord), declare Him as the only One God, (Who hath created you) as different lineages beginning from a drop of sperm, (and those before you) just as He created those who came before you, (so that ye may ward off) so that you may ward off His wrath and torment and obey Him."
ٱلَّذِي جَعَلَ لَكُمُ ٱلأَرْضَ فِرَٰشاً وَٱلسَّمَاءَ بِنَآءً وَأَنزَلَ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مَآءً فَأَخْرَجَ بِهِ مِنَ ٱلثَّمَرَٰتِ رِزْقاً لَّكُمْ فَلاَ تَجْعَلُواْ للَّهِ أَندَاداً وَأَنْتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ,"(Who hath appointed the earth a resting-place for you), a place for dwelling and sleeping, (and the sky a canopy), raised high above; (and causeth water to pour down from the sky), i.e. rain, (thereby producing) through this rain (fruits) different kinds of fruit (as food for you) as sustenance for you and all created beings. (So do not set up rivals to Allah) do not say that Allah has peers, different forms or coequals (when you know) that He is the fashioner of all these things. It is also said that (when you know) means: when you know from your own scripture that Allah does not have a son, coequal or peer."
وَإِن كُنْتُمْ فِي رَيْبٍ مِّمَّا نَزَّلْنَا عَلَىٰ عَبْدِنَا فَأْتُواْ بِسُورَةٍ مِّن مِّثْلِهِ وَٱدْعُواْ شُهَدَآءَكُم مِّن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ صَٰدِقِينَ,"(And if ye are in doubt concerning that which We revealed) through the Archangel Gabriel (unto Our slave) Muhammad whom you accuse of fabrication, (then produce a surah like it) produce a surah like the surah of the Cow (al-Baqarah), (and call your witnesses), seek help from the gods that you worship, (apart from Allah), it is said that this refers to their leaders, (if ye are truthful) in your claim."
فَإِن لَّمْ تَفْعَلُواْ وَلَن تَفْعَلُواْ فَٱتَّقُواْ ٱلنَّارَ ٱلَّتِي وَقُودُهَا ٱلنَّاسُ وَٱلْحِجَارَةُ أُعِدَّتْ لِلْكَٰفِرِينَ,"(And if ye do it not-and you can never do it-) this you can never do and if you try you will never succeed (then guard yourselves against the Fire) if you are bent on not believing, for you should fear hell (whose fuel is men) the unbelievers, (and stones) of sulphur, (prepared) created, prepared and preordained (for disbelievers)."
وَبَشِّرِ ٱلَّذِين آمَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّـٰلِحَٰتِ أَنَّ لَهُمْ جَنَّٰتٍ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلأَنْهَٰرُ كُلَّمَا رُزِقُواْ مِنْهَا مِن ثَمَرَةٍ رِّزْقاً قَالُواْ هَـٰذَا ٱلَّذِي رُزِقْنَا مِن قَبْلُ وَأُتُواْ بِهِ مُتَشَٰبِهاً وَلَهُمْ فِيهَآ أَزْوَٰجٌ مُّطَهَّرَةٌ وَهُمْ فِيهَا خَٰلِدُونَ,"Then He mentioned the favours enjoyed by the believers in Paradise, saying: (And give glad tidings unto those who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an (and do good works) of obedience that bind to their Lord; and it is also that this refers to doing any righteous deeds; (that theirs are Gardens beneath which), trees and habitations, (rivers flow) rivers of wine, milk, honey and water; (as often as they are provided with food), whenever they are fed in Paradise (of the fruit thereof) with different kinds of fruit, (they say: This is what was given us before), this is what we ate before, (and it is given to them) i.e. the food (in resemblance) as far as the colour is concerned but not the taste which is different. (There for them) in Paradise (are pure spouses), pure from menses or any kind of filth, (therein), in Paradise, (forever they abide) dwelling forever: never to die or be banished from it."
إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لاَ يَسْتَحْى أَن يَضْرِبَ مَثَلاً مَّا بَعُوضَةً فَمَا فَوْقَهَا فَأَمَّا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ فَيَعْلَمُونَ أَنَّهُ ٱلْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّهِمْ وَأَمَّا ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ فَيَقُولُونَ مَاذَآ أَرَادَ ٱللَّهُ بِهَـٰذَا مَثَلاً يُضِلُّ بِهِ كَثِيراً وَيَهْدِي بِهِ كَثِيراً وَمَا يُضِلُّ بِهِ إِلاَّ ٱلْفَٰسِقِينَ,"Then Allah mentioned the Jews' objection to the Qur'an's similes, saying: (Lo! Allah disdaineth not), He cannot abstain from coining similes, and how can He disdain mentioning something that if all created being were to join forces to create, they would not be able to do so. Allah does not disdain (to coin the similitude) Allah does not disdain explaining to people a similitude (even of a gnat), even regarding a gnat, (or what is above it) let alone a simile of something greater than a gnat such as a fly, or a spider. (Those who believe) in Muhammad and the Qur'an (know that it), the simile, (is the Truth from their Lord; but those who disbelieve), in Muhammad and the Qur'an, (say: What doth Allah wish (to teach) by such similitude?) say: O Muhammad! What Allah wishes by such simile is that (He misleadeth many thereby) of the Jews from the true Religion, (and He guideth many thereby) of the believers, (and He misleadeth thereby), by such similes, (only miscreants), the Jews."
ٱلَّذِينَ يَنقُضُونَ عَهْدَ ٱللَّهِ مِن بَعْدِ مِيثَٰقِهِ وَيَقْطَعُونَ مَآ أَمَرَ ٱللَّهُ بِهِ أَن يُوصَلَ وَيُفْسِدُونَ فِي ٱلأرْضِ أُولَـۤئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْخَٰسِرُونَ,"(Those who break the covenant of Allah) regarding this Prophet (pbuh) (after ratifying it), after sanctioning, confirming and vouchsafing it (and sever that which Allah hath ordered) of oaths and kinsfolk relations (to be joined) to Muhammad, (and (who) make mischief in the earth) by preventing people from the Religion of Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an: (Those are they who are the losers), the duped in that they lose both this world and the Hereafter."
كَيْفَ تَكْفُرُونَ بِٱللَّهِ وَكُنْتُمْ أَمْوَٰتاً فَأَحْيَٰكُمْ ثُمَّ يُمِيتُكُمْ ثُمَّ يُحْيِيكُمْ ثُمَّ إِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ,"(How disbelieve you in Allah) how astonishing that you disbelieve in Allah (when you were dead) sperm drops in the loins of your fathers (and He gave life to you!) in the wombs of your mothers. (Then He will give you death) when your lifespan ends, (then life again) for the Resurrection, (and then unto Him ye will be returned) in the Hereafter whereupon He shall requite you for your works."
هُوَ ٱلَّذِي خَلَقَ لَكُمْ مَّا فِي ٱلأَرْضِ جَمِيعاً ثُمَّ ٱسْتَوَىٰ إِلَى ٱلسَّمَآءِ فَسَوَّٰهُنَّ سَبْعَ سَمَٰوَٰتٍ وَهُوَ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عَلِيمٌ,"Allah then proceeded to mention His blessings on them, saying (He it is Who created for you), made subservient for you (all that is in the earth) of beasts, plants and other things, as a blessing from Him. (Then turned He to the heaven) i.e. He turned to the creation of the heaven, (and fashioned it as seven heavens) positioning them vertically above the earth. (And He is Knower of all things) regarding the creation of the heavens and earth."
وَإِذْ قَالَ رَبُّكَ لِلْمَلَٰئِكَةِ إِنِّي جَاعِلٌ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ خَلِيفَةً قَالُواْ أَتَجْعَلُ فِيهَا مَن يُفْسِدُ فِيهَا وَيَسْفِكُ ٱلدِّمَآءَ وَنَحْنُ نُسَبِّحُ بِحَمْدِكَ وَنُقَدِّسُ لَكَ قَالَ إِنِّيۤ أَعْلَمُ مَا لاَ تَعْلَمُونَ,"Then Allah, Exalted is He, mentioned the story of the angels who were commanded to prostrate to Adam, saying: (And when your Lord said unto the angels) who were already on the earth: (Lo! I am about to place a vicegerent in the earth), I am creating a vicegerent from the earth, (they said: Wilt Thou place therein), will you create therein (one who will do harm therein) by committing sin (and will shed blood) through transgression, (while we, we hymn Thy praise), pray following Your command (and sanctify Thee) and mention you in a state of purity? (He said: Surely I know that) which shall ensue from this vicegerent (which you know not)."
وَعَلَّمَ ءَادَمَ ٱلأَسْمَآءَ كُلَّهَا ثُمَّ عَرَضَهُمْ عَلَى ٱلْمَلَٰئِكَةِ فَقَالَ أَنْبِئُونِي بِأَسْمَآءِ هَـٰؤُلاۤءِ إِن كُنْتُمْ صَٰدِقِينَ,"(And He taught Adam all the names), the names of all his progeny, or the names of all the beasts and other things, including: a cooking pot, a plate and saucer, (then showed them) to prove that they were wrong (to the angels) who were commanded to prostrate, (saying: Inform Me of the names of these) created beings and descendents, (if ye are truthful) in your first claim."
قَالُواْ سُبْحَٰنَكَ لاَ عِلْمَ لَنَآ إِلاَّ مَا عَلَّمْتَنَآ إِنَّكَ أَنْتَ ٱلْعَلِيمُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ,"(They said: Be glorified!), we repent to you of what we said (We have no knowledge saving that which Thou hast taught us), inspired us with. (Lo! Thou, only Thou, art the Knower) of us and of them (the Wise) regarding our matters and theirs."
قَالَ يَآءَادَمُ أَنبِئْهُمْ بِأَسْمَآئِهِمْ فَلَمَّآ أَنْبَأَهُمْ بِأَسْمَآئِهِمْ قَالَ أَلَمْ أَقُلْ لَّكُمْ إِنِيۤ أَعْلَمُ غَيْبَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَأَعْلَمُ مَا تُبْدُونَ وَمَا كُنْتُمْ تَكْتُمُونَ,"(He said: O Adam! Inform them of their names, and when he had informed them of their names, He said: Did I not tell you that I know the secret of the heavens and the earth?) the unseen that will take place in the heavens and on the earth. (And I know that which ye disclose), what you show to your Lord in terms of your obedience to Adam (and that which ye hide) of this obedience. It is also said that this refers to what Satan disclosed and kept hidden from them."
وَإِذْ قُلْنَا لِلْمَلَٰئِكَةِ ٱسْجُدُواْ لأَدَمَ فَسَجَدُواْ إِلاَّ إِبْلِيسَ أَبَىٰ وَٱسْتَكْبَرَ وَكَانَ مِنَ ٱلْكَٰفِرِينَ,"(And when We said unto the angels: Prostrate yourselves before Adam), a prostration of salutation, (they fell prostrate, all save Iblis. He demurred through pride) to follow his Lord's command. (And so became a disbeliever) after this because he refused to comply with Allah's command. It is also said that it was in Allah's foreknowledge that Satan was to become a disbeliever; as it is said that he was the first unbeliever ever."
وَقُلْنَا يَآءَادَمُ ٱسْكُنْ أَنْتَ وَزَوْجُكَ ٱلْجَنَّةَ وَكُلاَ مِنْهَا رَغَداً حَيْثُ شِئْتُمَا وَلاَ تَقْرَبَا هَـٰذِهِ ٱلشَّجَرَةَ فَتَكُونَا مِنَ ٱلْظَّٰلِمِينَ,"Then Allah, Exalted is He, mentioned the story of Adam and Eve, saying: (And We said: O Adam! Dwell thou and thy wife in the Garden) enter you and Eve into Paradise (and eat ye freely (of the fruits)) without restriction (thereof where ye will) and whenever you will; (but come not near this tree) but do not eat from this tree, the tree of knowledge, which includes all types and kinds (lest ye become of the wrong-doers), lest you harm yourselves."
فَأَزَلَّهُمَا ٱلشَّيْطَٰنُ عَنْهَا فَأَخْرَجَهُمَا مِمَّا كَانَا فِيهِ وَقُلْنَا ٱهْبِطُواْ بَعْضُكُمْ لِبَعْضٍ عَدُوٌّ وَلَكُمْ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ مُسْتَقَرٌّ وَمَتَٰعٌ إِلَىٰ حِينٍ,"(But the Devil caused them to deflect), caused them to slip (therefrom), from Paradise, (and expelled them from the state in which they were), from the comfort which they had enjoyed; (and We said) to Adam, Eve, the peacock and the serpent (Fall down) go down to the earth, (one of you a foe unto the other! There shall be for you on earth a habitation), a dwelling-place, (and a provision), a benefit and livelihood, (for a time) until the moment of death."
فَتَلَقَّىٰ ءَادَمُ مِن رَّبِّهِ كَلِمَٰتٍ فَتَابَ عَلَيْهِ إِنَّهُ هُوَ ٱلتَّوَّابُ ٱلرَّحِيمُ,"(Then Adam received from his Lord) Adam learnt from his Lord, and it is said that he was taught and inspired with (words) so that they became a way for him and his progeny to repentance, (and He relented towards him), He forgave him. (Indeed! He is the Relenting), the One Who overlooks misdeeds, (the Merciful) towards any that dies repentant."
قُلْنَا ٱهْبِطُواْ مِنْهَا جَمِيعاً فَإِمَّا يَأْتِيَنَّكُم مِّنِّي هُدًى فَمَن تَبِعَ هُدَايَ فَلاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلاَ هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ,"(We said) to Adam, Eve, the serpent, the peacock and Satan: (Go down) from heaven, (all of you). Then Allah, Exalted is He, mentioned Adam's progeny, (from hence; but verily there cometh unto you), when and whenever it comes to you, (from Me a guidance), a scripture and an emissary; (whoso followeth My guidance) the scripture and the emissary, (there shall no fear come upon them) regarding any torment in the future, (neither shall they grieve) about what they have left behind them. It is also said that this means that no fear will come upon them perpetually and nor will they grieve perpetually; no fear will come upon them when death is slain and they will not grieve when hell is closed."
وَٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرواْ وَكَذَّبُواْ بِآيَٰتِنَآ أُولَـٰئِكَ أَصْحَٰبُ ٱلنَّارِ هُمْ فِيهَا خَٰلِدُونَ,"(But those who disbelieve, and deny our revelations), the scripture and the Emissary, (such are rightful owners of the Fire), the dwellers of hell. (They will abide therein forever), they will remain perpetually in hell: never to die or be released from it."
يَٰبَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ ٱذْكُرُواْ نِعْمَتِيَ ٱلَّتِي أَنْعَمْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ وَأَوْفُواْ بِعَهْدِيۤ أُوفِ بِعَهْدِكُمْ وَإِيَّٰيَ فَٱرْهَبُونِ,"Allah then mentioned His blessings upon the Children of Israel, saying: (O Children of Israel!) O Children of Jacob, (Remember My favour), be thankful and grateful for my blessings (wherewith I favoured you), I favoured you with the Scripture and the emissary, escape from Pharaoh and from drowning as well as sending you honey and quails and other blessings, (and fulfil My covenant) fulfil my covenant regarding this Prophet (pbuh) (I shall fulfil your covenant), by admitting you to Paradise, (and fear Me) as regards the breaking of this covenant and do not fear anyone save Me."
وَآمِنُواْ بِمَآ أَنزَلْتُ مُصَدِّقاً لِّمَا مَعَكُمْ وَلاَ تَكُونُوۤاْ أَوَّلَ كَافِرٍ بِهِ وَلاَ تَشْتَرُواْ بِآيَٰتِي ثَمَناً قَلِيلاً وَإِيَّٰيَ فَٱتَّقُونِ,"(And believe in that which I revealed) through the Archangel Gabriel, (confirming) the Oneness of Allah and the description and traits of Muhammad (pbuh) and some prescribed laws (that which ye possess already) of scripture, (and be not first to disbelieve therein) in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an (and part not with My revelations) by not revealing the description and traits of Muhammad (for a trifling price) in exchange for means of substance, (and keep your duty unto Me), fear Me regarding this Prophet (pbuh)."
وَلاَ تَلْبِسُواْ ٱلْحَقَّ بِٱلْبَٰطِلِ وَتَكْتُمُواْ ٱلْحَقَّ وَأَنْتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ,"(Confound not truth with falsehood), do not mix the Truth with falsehood, i.e. the description of the anti-Christ with the description of Muhammad (pbuh) (nor knowingly conceal the Truth), nor conceal the Truth while you know what is the Truth."
وَأَقِيمُواْ ٱلصَّلٰوةَ وَآتُواْ ٱلزَّكَٰوةَ وَٱرْكَعُواْ مَعَ ٱلرَّٰكِعِينَ,"Allah then proceeded to mention the necessity of observing the law once they had become believers, saying: (And establish prayer) fulfil completely the five prescribed prayers, (pay the poor-due), pay the poor-due from your wealth, (and bow your heads with those who bow), pray the five prescribed prayers in congregation with Muhammad (pbuh) and his Companions."
أَتَأْمُرُونَ ٱلنَّاسَ بِٱلْبِرِّ وَتَنْسَوْنَ أَنْفُسَكُمْ وَأَنْتُمْ تَتْلُونَ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ أَفَلاَ تَعْقِلُونَ,"Then He mentioned the story of the Jewish leaders, saying: (Enjoin ye righteousness upon mankind), do you enjoin the Oneness of Allah and the following of Muhammad (pbuh) upon people of humble background (while ye yourself forget), while you yourself refrain from following him? (And you are readers of the Scripture!) to them. (Have ye then no sense?) do you not possess the common sense possessed by human beings?"
وَٱسْتَعِينُواْ بِٱلصَّبْرِ وَٱلصَّلَٰوةِ وَإِنَّهَا لَكَبِيرَةٌ إِلاَّ عَلَى ٱلْخَٰشِعِينَ,"(And seek help in patience and prayer) in performing the obligations prescribed by Allah and abstaining from transgression; (for truly it), the prayer (is hard) heavy (save for the humble-minded,"
ٱلَّذِينَ يَظُنُّونَ أَنَّهُم مُّلَـٰقُواْ رَبِّهِمْ وَأَنَّهُمْ إِلَيْهِ رَٰجِعُونَ,"who know that they will have to meet their Lord) see Him, (and that unto Him they are returning) after they die."
يَٰبَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ ٱذْكُرُواْ نِعْمَتِي ٱلَّتِيۤ أَنْعَمْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ وَأَنِّي فَضَّلْتُكُمْ عَلَى ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ,"Then He also mentioned His blessings upon the Children of Israel, saying: (O Children of Israel!), O Children of Jacob! (Remember My favour), recollect my blessings (wherewith I favoured you) with the scripture, the Messenger and Islam (and how I preferred you to the worlds) sought you in preference to the other peoples of your time."
وَٱتَّقُواْ يَوْماً لاَّ تَجْزِي نَفْسٌ عَن نَّفْسٍ شَيْئاً وَلاَ يُقْبَلُ مِنْهَا شَفَٰعَةٌ وَلاَ يُؤْخَذُ مِنْهَا عَدْلٌ وَلاَ هُمْ يُنْصَرُونَ,"(And guard yourselves against a day), and if you do not believe and repent of Judaism, then fear the torment of a day (when no soul will in anything avail another), no unbelieving soul will avail another unbelieving soul, (nor will intercession be accepted from it) and no intercessor will be allowed to intercede, (nor will compensation be received from it) and no ransom accepted, (neither will they be helped) to avoid Allah's chastisement."
وَإِذْ نَجَّيْنَٰكُم مِّنْ آلِ فِرْعَوْنَ يَسُومُونَكُمْ سُوۤءَ ٱلْعَذَابِ يُذَبِّحُونَ أَبْنَآءَكُمْ وَيَسْتَحْيُونَ نِسَآءَكُمْ وَفِي ذَٰلِكُمْ بَلاۤءٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ عَظِيمٌ,"(And (remember) when We did deliver you from Pharaoh's folk), from Pharaoh and his people, (who were afflicting you with dreadful torment), and here Allah mentions the torment He sent on them: (slaying your sons) in their tender years (and sparing), using (your women) who were of age: (That was a tremendous trial from your Lord), a tremendous calamity from your Lord; and it is also said this means: a tremendous blessing."
وَإِذْ فَرَقْنَا بِكُمُ ٱلْبَحْرَ فَأَنجَيْنَٰكُمْ وَأَغْرَقْنَا آلَ فِرْعَوْنَ وَأَنْتُمْ تَنظُرُونَ,"Then Allah mentioned the favour of saving them from drowning and the drowning of Pharaoh and his folk, saying (And when We brought you through) split (the sea and rescued you) from drowning,(and drowned the folk of Pharaoh) and his folk (in your sight) while you were looking at them, three days later."
وَإِذْ وَٰعَدْنَا مُوسَىٰ أَرْبَعِينَ لَيْلَةً ثُمَّ ٱتَّخَذْتُمُ ٱلْعِجْلَ مِن بَعْدِهِ وَأَنْتُمْ ظَٰلِمُونَ,"(And when We appointed for Moses forty nights) by giving him the scripture, (and then you chose the calf), you worshipped the calf, (when he had gone from you) to the mountain, (and you were wrong-doers) harmful both to yourselves and others."
ثُمَّ عَفَوْنَا عَنكُم مِّن بَعْدِ ذَلِكَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ,"(Then, even after that), after you worshipped the calf, (We pardoned you), left you alone and did not exterminate you (in order that ye might give thanks), so that you might give thanks to Us for pardoning you."
وَإِذْ آتَيْنَا مُوسَى ٱلْكِتَابَ وَٱلْفُرْقَانَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَهْتَدُونَ,"(And when We gave unto Moses the Scripture), the Torah, (and the Criterion) i.e. We showed in it the lawful and the unlawful, the commands and the prohibitions, as well as other things; it is also said that this means: triumph over Pharaoh, (that you might be led rightfully) guided to avoid error."
وَإِذْ قَالَ مُوسَىٰ لِقَوْمِهِ يَٰقَوْمِ إِنَّكُمْ ظَلَمْتُمْ أَنْفُسَكُمْ بِٱتِّخَاذِكُمُ ٱلْعِجْلَ فَتُوبُوۤاْ إِلَىٰ بَارِئِكُمْ فَٱقْتُلُوۤاْ أَنفُسَكُمْ ذَٰلِكُمْ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ عِنْدَ بَارِئِكُمْ فَتَابَ عَلَيْكُمْ إِنَّهُ هُوَ ٱلتَّوَّابُ ٱلرَّحِيمُ,"Allah then mentioned the story of Moses with his people, saying: (And when Moses said unto his people: O my people! Ye have wronged yourselves) harmed yourselves (by your choosing of the calf) by worshipping the calf; and when Moses was then asked what to do, he said to them: (so turn in penitence to your Creator), again they asked him how to turn in penitence to Allah, and he said: (and kill (the guilty) among yourselves) let those who did not worship the calf kill those who worshipped it. (That) penitence and killing (will be best for you with your Creator and He will relent towards you) He will forgive you. (Lo! He is the Relenting) towards the penitent, (the Merciful) towards any that die repentant."
وَإِذْ قُلْتُمْ يَٰمُوسَىٰ لَن نُّؤْمِنَ لَكَ حَتَّىٰ نَرَى ٱللَّهَ جَهْرَةً فَأَخَذَتْكُمُ ٱلصَّٰعِقَةُ وَأَنْتُمْ تَنظُرُونَ,(And when you said: O Moses! We will not believe in you) in what you say (till we see Allah plainly) until we see Him plainly as you did; (and even while you gazed the lightning seized you) the Fire burnt you while you were looking at it.
ثُمَّ بَعَثْنَٰكُم مِّن بَعْدِ مَوْتِكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ,"(Then We revived you) We brought you back to life (after your death) after burning you, (that ye might give thanks) that you might give thanks that I brought you back to life."
وَظَلَّلْنَا عَلَيْكُمُ ٱلْغَمَامَ وَأَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْكُمُ ٱلْمَنَّ وَٱلسَّلْوَىٰ كُلُواْ مِن طَيِّبَٰتِ مَا رَزَقْنَٱكُمْ وَمَا ظَلَمُونَا وَلَـٰكِن كَانُوۤاْ أَنْفُسَهُمْ يَظْلِمُونَ,"(And We caused the white cloud to overshadow you) in the wilderness (and sent down on you honey and quails) also in the wilderness, (Eat of the good things) of the lawful things (wherewith We have provided you) that We have given you and do not keep any provision for future days. Yet they did save food for future days-(They wronged us not) by saving food, (but they did wrong themselves) they harmed themselves."
وَإِذْ قُلْنَا ٱدْخُلُواْ هَـٰذِهِ ٱلْقَرْيَةَ فَكُلُواْ مِنْهَا حَيْثُ شِئْتُمْ رَغَداً وَٱدْخُلُواْ ٱلْبَابَ سُجَّداً وَقُولُواْ حِطَّةٌ نَّغْفِرْ لَكُمْ خَطَٰيَٰكُمْ وَسَنَزِيدُ ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,"(And when We said: Go into this township) the village of Jericho (Ariha) (and eat freely of that which is therein) whenever you will, (and enter the gate prostrate, and say: "" Repentance "".) i.e. say: "" forgive our sins "" ; as it is also said that this means: say: "" there is no god save Allah "" ; (We will forgive your sins and increase for the right-doers) increase their good deeds."
فَبَدَّلَ ٱلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ قَوْلاً غَيْرَ ٱلَّذِي قِيلَ لَهُمْ فَأَنزَلْنَا عَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ رِجْزاً مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ بِمَا كَانُواْ يَفْسُقُونَ,"(But those who did wrong) to themselves, and these are the people who said: “Repentance” (changed the word which had been told them for another word) they disobeyed the command and said “Wheat!”, (and We sent down upon the evil-doers) who changed the word they were ordered to say (wrath) the plague (from Heaven for their evildoing) for changing the commands they were ordered to fulfil."
وَإِذِ ٱسْتَسْقَىٰ مُوسَىٰ لِقَوْمِهِ فَقُلْنَا ٱضْرِب بِّعَصَاكَ ٱلْحَجَرَ فَٱنفَجَرَتْ مِنْهُ ٱثْنَتَا عَشْرَةَ عَيْناً قَدْ عَلِمَ كُلُّ أُنَاسٍ مَّشْرَبَهُمْ كُلُواْ وَٱشْرَبُواْ مِن رِّزْقِ ٱللَّهِ وَلاَ تَعْثَوْاْ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ مُفْسِدِينَ,"(And when Moses asked for water for his people) in the wilderness, (We said: smite with your staff the rock) that you have with you. This was a rock given to him by Allah. It had 12 nipples that resemble the nipples of women and upon striking each one of these a spring gushed therefrom. (And there gushed out therefrom twelve springs (so that) each tribe knew their drinking place) each tribe knew their own spring. Allah said to them: (Eat) the honey and quails (and drink of) all the springs (that which Allah hath provided. And do not act corruptly, making mischief in the earth) and do not cause mischief on the earth, or act contrary to what Moses commanded."
وَإِذْ قُلْتُمْ يَٰمُوسَىٰ لَن نَّصْبِرَ عَلَىٰ طَعَامٍ وَاحِدٍ فَٱدْعُ لَنَا رَبَّكَ يُخْرِجْ لَنَا مِمَّا تُنْبِتُ ٱلأَرْضُ مِن بَقْلِهَا وَقِثَّآئِهَا وَفُومِهَا وَعَدَسِهَا وَبَصَلِهَا قَالَ أَتَسْتَبْدِلُونَ ٱلَّذِي هُوَ أَدْنَىٰ بِٱلَّذِي هُوَ خَيْرٌ ٱهْبِطُواْ مِصْراً فَإِنَّ لَكُمْ مَّا سَأَلْتُمْ وَضُرِبَتْ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلذِّلَّةُ وَٱلْمَسْكَنَةُ وَبَآءُو بِغَضَبٍ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ ذَلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ يَكْفُرُونَ بِآيَاتِ ٱللَّهِ وَيَقْتُلُونَ ٱلنَّبِيِّينَ بِغَيْرِ ٱلْحَقِّ ذٰلِكَ بِمَا عَصَواْ وَّكَانُواْ يَعْتَدُونَ,"(And when you said: O Moses! We will not endure one kind of food) we will not endure eating just honey and quails; (so pray unto your Lord) ask your Lord (for us that He bring forth for us of that which the earth groweth of its herbs and its cucumbers and its corn and its lentils and its onions. He) i.e. Moses (said: Would you exchange that which is higher) i.e. that which is better and more honourable: honey and quails (for that which is lower) that which is much worse: lentils and onions? (Go down to any city) where you came from; and it is also said that this means any city, (thus you shall get that which you demand) what you have requested is to be found there. (And humiliation) the capitation tax (and wretchedness) the attire of poverty (were stamped upon them) were imposed on them (and they were visited with wrath from Allah) as they deserved to be forsaken by Allah. (That) being forsaken by Allah and visited by humiliation and wretchedness (was because they disbelieved in Allah's revelations) they disbelieved in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an (and slew the prophets wrongfully) without any right and for no crime whatsoever. (That) Allah's wrath (was for their disobedience) on the Sabbath (and transgression) slaying the prophets and declaring transgressions to be lawful."
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَٱلَّذِينَ هَادُواْ وَٱلنَّصَارَىٰ وَٱلصَّابِئِينَ مَنْ آمَنَ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلآخِرِ وَعَمِلَ صَالِحاً فَلَهُمْ أَجْرُهُمْ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ وَلاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلاَ هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ,"Then Allah went on to mention the believers among them, saying: (Lo! Those who believe) in Moses and all the other prophets, these earn their reward from their Lord in Paradise; they shall have no fear perpetually and they shall perpetually not grieve. It is said that this means that no fear will come upon them concerning torment in the future life nor will they grieve about anything they have left behind. And it is also said that this means: they shall have no fear when death is slain and hell is closed. Then He mentioned those who did not believe in Moses or the other prophets, saying: (and those who are Jews) who deviated from the religion of Moses, (and Christians) those who became Christians (and Sabaeans) a Christian sect whose members shave the middle of their heads, read the Gospel, worship the angels and say: "" our hearts have returned (saba'at) unto Allah "" , (whoever believeth) from amongst them (in Allah and the Last Day and does right) in that which is between them and their Lord, (surely their reward is with their Lord, and there shall no fear come upon them neither shall they grieve)."
وَإِذْ أَخَذْنَا مِيثَاقَكُمْ وَرَفَعْنَا فَوْقَكُمُ ٱلطُّورَ خُذُواْ مَآ ءَاتَيْنَٰكُم بِقُوَّةٍ وَٱذْكُرُواْ مَا فِيهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ,"Allah then mentions the covenant He undertook with them, saying (And when We made a covenant with you) took your consent (and caused the Mount to tower above you) pulled out and fixed high above your heads the mountain for taking the covenant: (Hold fast that which We have given you) comply with what We have given of the scripture in earnestness and diligence, (and remember that which is therein) of reward and chastisement, and recollect what is in it of the lawful and unlawful, (that ye may ward off (evil)) in order that you may ward off Allah's wrath and torment and so that you may obey Him."
ثُمَّ تَوَلَّيْتُمْ مِّن بَعْدِ ذٰلِكَ فَلَوْلاَ فَضْلُ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ وَرَحْمَتُهُ لَكُنْتُم مِّنَ ٱلْخَاسِرِينَ,"(Then, even after that, you turned away) you turned your back on the covenant, (and if it had not been for the grace of Allah upon you) by deferring His punishment (and His mercy) by sending Muhammad (pbuh) to you (you had been among the losers) you would have among the duped who are exposed to Allah's punishment."
وَلَقَدْ عَلِمْتُمُ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱعْتَدَواْ مِنْكُمْ فِي ٱلسَّبْتِ فَقُلْنَا لَهُمْ كُونُواْ قِرَدَةً خَاسِئِينَ,"(And ye know) you indeed know and heard about the punishment (of those of you who broke) who have taken the covenant (the Sabbath) the day of Saturday and this at the time of David (pbuh) (how We said unto them: Be ye apes, despised and hated!) turned into humiliated and base apes."
فَجَعَلْنَاهَا نَكَالاً لِّمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيْهَا وَمَا خَلْفَهَا وَمَوْعِظَةً لِّلْمُتَّقِينَ,"(And We made it) turning them into apes (an example) we subjected them to a chastisement (to their own) for the sins they had committed before, (and) made them a lesson (to succeeding generations) in order that they do not follow their example (and admonition to the God-fearing) and a counsel and warning to those who fear Allah, i.e. Muhammad (pbuh) and his Companions."
وَإِذْ قَالَ مُوسَىٰ لِقَوْمِهِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَأْمُرُكُمْ أَنْ تَذْبَحُواْ بَقَرَةً قَالُوۤاْ أَتَتَّخِذُنَا هُزُواً قَالَ أَعُوذُ بِٱللَّهِ أَنْ أَكُونَ مِنَ ٱلْجَاهِلِينَ,"Allah then mentions the story of the cow, saying: (And when Moses said unto his people: Lo! Allah commandeth you that ye sacrifice a cow) any cow, (they said: Dost thou make game of us?) are you really mocking us? (He) Moses (answered: Allah forbid that I should be among the foolish!) God forbid that I ever mock the believers."
قَالُواْ ٱدْعُ لَنَا رَبَّكَ يُبَيِّن لَّنَا مَا هِيَ قَالَ إِنَّهُ يَقُولُ إِنَّهَا بَقَرَةٌ لاَّ فَارِضٌ وَلاَ بِكْرٌ عَوَانٌ بَيْنَ ذٰلِكَ فَٱفْعَلُواْ مَا تُؤْمَرونَ,"When they realised he was truthful, (They said: Pray for us unto your Lord That He make clear to us what she is) whether the cow is large or small. (Moses answered: Lo! He saith, Verily she is a cow neither old nor immature; (she is) between the two conditions) neither large nor small; (so do that which ye are commanded) and ask no further questions."
قَالُواْ ٱدْعُ لَنَا رَبَّكَ يُبَيِّن لَّنَا مَا لَوْنُهَا قَالَ إِنَّهُ يَقُولُ إِنَّهَا بَقَرَةٌ صَفْرَآءُ فَاقِـعٌ لَّوْنُهَا تَسُرُّ ٱلنَّاظِرِينَ,"(They said: Pray for us unto your Lord that He make clear to us of what colour she is) what colour the cow is. ((Moses) answered: Lo! He saith: Surely she is a yellow cow) her hoofs and horns are yellow while her body is black. (Bright is her colour) her colour is light, (gladdening beholders) pleasing those who look at her."
قَالُواْ ٱدْعُ لَنَا رَبَّكَ يُبَيِّن لَّنَا مَا هِيَ إِنَّ ٱلبَقَرَ تَشَابَهَ عَلَيْنَا وَإِنَّآ إِن شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ لَمُهْتَدُونَ,"(They said: pray for us unto your Lord that He make clear to us what (cow) she is) whether she ploughs the soil or not. (Lo! Cows are much alike to us) we cannot distinguish much between cows; (and lo! If Allah wills, we may be led rightfully) to its fitting description; as it is said that this means: we may be led to the murder of 'Amil."
قَالَ إِنَّهُ يَقُولُ إِنَّهَا بَقَرَةٌ لاَّ ذَلُولٌ تُثِيرُ ٱلأَرْضَ وَلاَ تَسْقِي ٱلْحَرْثَ مُسَلَّمَةٌ لاَّ شِيَةَ فِيهَا قَالُواْ ٱلآنَ جِئْتَ بِٱلْحَقِّ فَذَبَحُوهَا وَمَا كَادُواْ يَفْعَلُونَ,"((Moses) answered: Lo! He saith: Surely she is a cow unyoked) unfettered; (she plougheth not the soil) she is not subjugated for the ploughing of the soil (nor watereth the tilth) nor for carrying water to irrigate it; (whole) free from any blemish (and without mark) spots or flecks of white. (They said: now thou bringest the Truth) now we know the cow's right description. They looked for it and bought her in exchange for her weight in gold. (So they sacrificed her, though almost they did not) i.e. initially; as it is said because the cow was hugely expensive."
وَإِذْ قَتَلْتُمْ نَفْساً فَٱدَّارَأْتُمْ فِيهَا وَٱللَّهُ مُخْرِجٌ مَّا كُنْتُمْ تَكْتُمُونَ,"Then Allah mentioned the murdered person, saying: (And (remember) when ye slew a man) 'Amil (and disagreed concerning it) concerning his murder (and Allah brought forth that which ye were hiding) thus demonstrating what you hid with regard to his murder."
فَقُلْنَا ٱضْرِبُوهُ بِبَعْضِهَا كَذَلِكَ يُحْيِي ٱللَّهُ ٱلْمَوْتَىٰ وَيُرِيكُمْ آيَاتِهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ,(And We said: Smite him) the murdered person (with some of it) with an organ of the cow; and it is also said: with its tail or tongue. (Thus) just as He brought 'Amil back to life (Allah bringeth the dead to life) for the Resurrection (and showeth you His portents) bringing the dead to life (so that ye may understand) in order that you may believe in resurrection after death.
ثُمَّ قَسَتْ قُلُوبُكُمْ مِّن بَعْدِ ذٰلِكَ فَهِيَ كَٱلْحِجَارَةِ أَوْ أَشَدُّ قَسْوَةً وَإِنَّ مِنَ ٱلْحِجَارَةِ لَمَا يَتَفَجَّرُ مِنْهُ ٱلأَنْهَارُ وَإِنَّ مِنْهَا لَمَا يَشَّقَّقُ فَيَخْرُجُ مِنْهُ ٱلْمَآءُ وَإِنَّ مِنْهَا لَمَا يَهْبِطُ مِنْ خَشْيَةِ ٱللَّهِ وَمَا ٱللَّهُ بِغَافِلٍ عَمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ,"(Then, even after that) after bringing 'Amil back to life and informing you about his murderer, (your hearts were hardened) dry and barren (and became as rocks, or worse than rock, for hardness. For indeed there are rocks from out which rivers gush, and indeed there are some which split asunder so that water floweth from them. And indeed there are some which fall down) from the top of mountains to the bottom (for the fear of Allah) but your hearts are not moved by fear of Allah. (Allah is not unaware of) will not leave unpunished (what ye do) of transgressions; and it is said the meaning is: what you hide of transgression."
أَفَتَطْمَعُونَ أَن يُؤْمِنُواْ لَكُمْ وَقَدْ كَانَ فَرِيقٌ مِّنْهُمْ يَسْمَعُونَ كَلاَمَ ٱللَّهِ ثُمَّ يُحَرِّفُونَهُ مِن بَعْدِ مَا عَقَلُوهُ وَهُمْ يَعْلَمُونَ,"(Have ye any hope that they will be true to you) do you hope, O Muhammad, that the Jews will believe in you (when a party of them) the 70 men who were with Moses (used to listen to the Word of Allah) used to listen to Moses reciting the Word of Allah, (then used to change it) alter it, (after they had understood it) after knowing it and fully understanding it (knowingly?) while knowing that they were altering it?"
وَإِذَا لَقُواْ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ قَالُوۤاْ آمَنَّا وَإِذَا خَلاَ بَعْضُهُمْ إِلَىٰ بَعْضٍ قَالُوۤاْ أَتُحَدِّثُونَهُم بِمَا فَتَحَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْكُمْ لِيُحَآجُّوكُم بِهِ عِنْدَ رَبِّكُمْ أَفَلاَ تَعْقِلُونَ,"Then Allah mentioned the hypocrites of the people of the Book, and it is also said that the reference here is to the lowly from among the people of the Book, saying: (And when they fall with those who believe) Abu Bakr and his companions, (they say: We believe) in your Prophet, and his description and traits are mentioned in our Book. (But when they go apart one with another) when these lowly people return to their leaders (they say) the leaders say to the lowly: (Prate ye to them) i.e. Muhammad and his Companions (of that which Allah hath disclosed to you) about that which Allah has shown you regarding the description and traits of Muhammad in your Book (so that they may contend with you) argue against you (before your Lord concerning it? Have ye then no sense?) do you not have any common sense?"
أَوَلاَ يَعْلَمُونَ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَعْلَمُ مَا يُسِرُّونَ وَمَا يُعْلِنُونَ,"Allah, Exalted is He, says: (Are they) i.e. these leaders (then unaware that Allah knoweth that which they keep hidden) amongst themselves (and that which they proclaim?) to Muhammad and his Companions."
وَمِنْهُمْ أُمِّيُّونَ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ ٱلْكِتَابَ إِلاَّ أَمَانِيَّ وَإِنْ هُمْ إِلاَّ يَظُنُّونَ,(Among them are unlettered folk who know not the scripture) they do not know how to read or write it (except from hearsay) except the unfounded things they hear. (They but guess) their talk is all surmise based on what they heard from their leaders.
فَوَيْلٌ لِّلَّذِينَ يَكْتُبُونَ ٱلْكِتَابَ بِأَيْدِيهِمْ ثُمَّ يَقُولُونَ هَـٰذَا مِنْ عِنْدِ ٱللَّهِ لِيَشْتَرُواْ بِهِ ثَمَناً قَلِيلاً فَوَيْلٌ لَّهُمْ مِّمَّا كَتَبَتْ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَوَيْلٌ لَّهُمْ مِّمَّا يَكْسِبُونَ,"(Therefore woe) severe punishment, and it is said this means: a valley in hell (be unto those who write the Scripture with their hands) change the description and traits of Muhammad (pbuh) in the Book (and then say, “This is) in the Book that has come (from Allah”, that they may purchase) through changing and altering it (a small gain therewith) a small gain in terms of means of subsistence and surplus of property. (Woe unto them) theirs is a severe punishment (for what their hands have written) have altered (and woe unto them) and theirs is a severe punishment (for what they earn thereby) of unlawful earnings and bribes."
وَقَالُواْ لَن تَمَسَّنَا ٱلنَّارُ إِلاَّ أَيَّاماً مَّعْدُودَةً قُلْ أَتَّخَذْتُمْ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ عَهْداً فَلَنْ يُخْلِفَ ٱللَّهُ عَهْدَهُ أَمْ تَقُولُونَ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ مَا لاَ تَعْلَمُونَ,"(And they say) i.e. the Jews: (Hellfire will not touch us save for a certain number of days) only for 40 days, the number of days in which our forefathers worshipped the calf. (Say) O Muhammad: (Have ye received a covenant from Allah) for what you are saying-(truly Allah will not break His covenant) if indeed you have a covenant with Allah-(or tell ye) or do you indeed tell (concerning Allah that which ye know not?) that which you know does not exist in your Book?"
بَلَىٰ مَن كَسَبَ سَيِّئَةً وَأَحَاطَتْ بِهِ خَطِيـۤئَتُهُ فَأُوْلَـۤئِكَ أَصْحَابُ ٱلنَّارِ هُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ,"(Nay) here Allah answers the Jews, (but whoever hath done evil) ascribes partners to Allah (and his sins surround him) and dies ascribing partners to Allah; (such are) those who have these attributes (rightful owners of the Fire) the dwellers of hell; (they will abide therein forever) perpetually, they will neither die nor leave it."
وَٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ أُولَـٰئِكَ أَصْحَابُ ٱلْجَنَّةِ هُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ,"Allah then mentions the believers, saying: (And those who believe) in Muhammad and the Qur'an (and do good works) acts of obedience that are between them and their Lord, (such are rightful owners of Paradise. They will abide therein forever) perpetually, they will never die or come out of it."

(Then, after that, ye slid back) you turned back on this covenant, (save a few of you) from amongst your forefathers; as it is said that this refers to 'Abdullah Ibn Salam and his companions, (being averse) denying and leaving it aside."
وَإِذْ أَخَذْنَا مِيثَاقَكُمْ لاَ تَسْفِكُونَ دِمَآءَكُمْ وَلاَ تُخْرِجُونَ أَنْفُسَكُمْ مِّن دِيَارِكُمْ ثُمَّ أَقْرَرْتُمْ وَأَنْتُمْ تَشْهَدُونَ,"(And when We made with you a covenant) in the Book: (shed not the blood of your people) do not kill one another (nor turn your people) i.e. one another (out of your dwellings) from your homes, meaning: the Banu Qurayzah and Banu'l-Nadir. (Then ye ratified (Our covenant)) you agreed to it (and ye were witnesses (thereto)) while knowing what you were doing."

(Believe ye in part of the Scripture) the part that stipulates freeing your captives from the enemy (and disbelieve ye in part thereof?) and leave the captives of your friends without ransoming them. It is also said that this verse means: do you believe in those parts of the scripture that suit your whim and disbelieve in those parts that do not? (And what is the reward of those who do so save ignominy in the life of the world) by being killed or captured as slaves, (and on the Day of Resurrection they will be consigned to the most grievous doom. For Allah is not unaware) He is not reducing your punishment because (of what ye do) in terms of transgression; and it is also said: because of what they concealed."

(Nay) this is a reply to them, (but Allah hath cursed them) sealed their hearts (for their disbelief) as a punishment for their disbelief. (Little is that which they believe) they believe neither much nor a little; it is also said that this means: they do not believe in what you say at all."

Nor did they teach it to anyone) nor did the angels describe anything to anyone (till they had said) at the outset: (We are only a temptation) we have been tried with calling people to this in order that we reduce the intensity of the torment inflicted on ourselves, (therefore disbelieve not) do not learn or act upon it. (And from these two (angels) people learn) without being taught by them (that by which they cause division between man and wife) that by which a man finds excuse to leave his wife; (but they injure thereby) with sorcery and causing rift (no one save by Allah's leave) except through Allah's will and with His knowledge. (And they learn) the devils, the Jews and sorcerers learn from each other (that which harms them) in the Hereafter (and profits them not) in this world or the next. (And surely they do know) this refers to the angels, and it is said that it refers to the Jews in their Book, as it is said that his refers to the devils (that he who trafficketh therein) chooses sorcery and white magic (will have no (happy) portion in the Hereafter) in Paradise; (and surely evil is the price for which they sold their souls) by choosing sorcery for themselves, and the reference here is to the Jews, (if they but knew) but they do not know; and it is said that this means: and they did know this from their own Book."
وَلَوْ أَنَّهُمْ آمَنُواْ وٱتَّقَوْا لَمَثُوبَةٌ مِّنْ عِندِ ٱللَّهِ خَيْرٌ لَّوْ كَانُواْ يَعْلَمُونَ,"(And if they) i.e. the Jews (had believed) in Muhammad and the Qur'an (and kept from evil) repented from Judaism and sorcery, (a recompense from Allah) a reward from Allah (would be better) than Judaism and sorcery, (if they only knew) if they believed in Allah's reward, but they do not know nor do they believe; and it is said that they knew all this from their Book."
يَٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ لاَ تَقُولُواْ رَاعِنَا وَقُولُواْ ٱنْظُرْنَا وَٱسْمَعُواْ وَلِلكَافِرِينَ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,"Then Allah mentions His prohibition to the believers not to use the same vocabulary used by the Jews, saying: (O ye who believe) in Muhammad and the Qur'an, (say not) to Muhammad: ( "" Listen to us "" ) lend us your ear (but say "" Look upon us, "" ) look at us and hear us, and it is for this reason that Allah forbade the believers to use the Jews' vocabulary (and be ye listeners) to what you have been commanded to do and obey. (For disbelievers) for the Jews (is a painful doom) which will extend to their hearts."
مَّا يَوَدُّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِنْ أَهْلِ ٱلْكِتَابِ وَلاَ ٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ أَن يُنَزَّلَ عَلَيْكُمْ مِّنْ خَيْرٍ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ يَخْتَصُّ بِرَحْمَتِهِ مَن يَشَآءُ وَٱللَّهُ ذُو ٱلْفَضْلِ ٱلْعَظِيمِ,"(Neither those who disbelieve among the people of the Scripture) Ka'b Ibn al-Ashraf and his companions (nor the idolaters) the idolaters of Arabia: Abu Jahl and his companions (love that there should be sent down unto you) that Allah should send Gabriel unto your Prophet (any good thing) the good of prophethood, Islam and the Book (from your Lord. But Allah chooseth for His mercy) chooses for His religion, prophethood, Islam and the Book (whom He will) whoever deserves to be chosen, i.e. Muhammad (pbuh) (and Allah is of infinite mercy) His favour in giving Muhammad prophethood and Islam is great indeed."
مَا نَنسَخْ مِنْ آيَةٍ أَوْ نُنسِهَا نَأْتِ بِخَيْرٍ مِّنْهَا أَوْ مِثْلِهَا أَلَمْ تَعْلَمْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,"Then Allah mentions what was abrogated of the Qur'an and that which was not abrogated, as a direct reference to the claim of the Quraysh who said to the Prophet: O Muhammad! Why do you command us to do something and then forbid it, saying: (Such of Our revelations as We abrogate) We do not erase a verse that was acted upon before and which is now not acted upon (or cause to be forgotten) or leave unabrogated so that it is acted upon, (We bring one better) We send Gabriel with that which more profitable and easier to act upon (or the like) in reward, benefit and action. (Knowest thou not) O Muhammad (that Allah is Able to do all things?) of the abrogated and unabrogated."
أَلَمْ تَعْلَمْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَهُ مُلْكُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَمَا لَكُمْ مِّن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ مِن وَلِيٍّ وَلاَ نَصِيرٍ,"(Knowest thou not) O Muhammad (that it is Allah unto Whom belongeth the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth) the stores of the heavens and earth; He commands His servants with whatever He wills because He knows better what is good for them; (and ye have not) O Jews, (apart from Allah) from Allah's torment, (any friend) anyone close to benefit or protect you (or helper?) anyone that can prevent your punishment."
أَمْ تُرِيدُونَ أَن تَسْأَلُواْ رَسُولَكُمْ كَمَا سُئِلَ مُوسَىٰ مِن قَبْلُ وَمَن يَتَبَدَّلِ ٱلْكُفْرَ بِٱلإِيمَانِ فَقَدْ ضَلَّ سَوَآءَ ٱلسَّبِيلِ,"(Or would ye question your messenger) ask him to see your Lord, hear His speech and other similar things (as Moses was questioned) as the Children of Israel asked Moses (before) before the advent of Muhammad (pbuh)? (He who chooseth disbelief instead of faith, verily he hath gone astray from a plain road) he has relinquished the path of guidance."

(after your belief) in Muhammad and the Qur'an, (through envy of their own account) through resentful envy, (after the Truth hath become manifest unto them) in their Book that Muhammad and his Book, his description and traits, are true, (So forgive) leave them (and be indulgent) shun them (until Allah giveth command) brings His chastisement upon Banu Qurayzah and Banu'l-Nadir, through killing, captivity and expulsion. (Lo! Allah is Able to do all things) to cause their death and expulsion."
وَأَقِيمُواْ ٱلصَّلَٰوةَ وَآتُواْ ٱلزَّكَٰوةَ وَمَا تُقَدِّمُواْ لأَنْفُسِكُم مِّنْ خَيْرٍ تَجِدُوهُ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ,"(And establish prayer) perfect the five daily prayers, (and pay the poor-due) pay the poor what is due from your wealth; (and whatever of good) of righteous deeds, and the poor-due and charitable works (ye send before for your souls) you save for yourselves, (ye will find it) you will find its reward (with Allah) from Allah. (Lo! Allah is Seer) knows your intentions (of what ye do) of what you spend in charity and the poor-due."

(These are their own desires) what they wish from Allah even though it is not in their Books. (Say) O Muhammad, to both parties: (Bring your proofs) from your own respective Books (if ye are truthful) in your claim."
بَلَىٰ مَنْ أَسْلَمَ وَجْهَهُ للَّهِ وَهُوَ مُحْسِنٌ فَلَهُ أَجْرُهُ عِندَ رَبِّهِ وَلاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلاَ هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ,"(Nay) it is certainly not as you have claimed, (but whoever surrendereth his purpose to Allah) whoever makes sincere his Religion and works to Allah (while doing good) in words and deeds, (his reward is with his Lord) in Paradise; (and there shall no fear come upon them) about staying eternally in hell (neither shall they grieve) about the prospect of missing Paradise."
وَقَالَتِ ٱلْيَهُودُ لَيْسَتِ ٱلنَّصَارَىٰ عَلَىٰ شَيْءٍ وَقَالَتِ ٱلنَّصَارَىٰ لَيْسَتِ ٱلْيَهُودُ عَلَىٰ شَيْءٍ وَهُمْ يَتْلُونَ ٱلْكِتَابَ كَذَلِكَ قَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ مِثْلَ قَوْلِهِمْ فَٱللَّهُ يَحْكُمُ بَيْنَهُمْ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ فِيمَا كَانُواْ فِيهِ يَخْتَلِفُونَ,"Allah then mentions the claims of the Jews and Christians that their respective religion is the true Religion, saying: (And Jews) the Jews of Medina (say Christians follow nothing) as religion from God and there is no true religion except Judaism, (and Christians) the Christians of Najran (say Jews follow nothing) as religion from God and there is no true religion except Christianity; (though both are readers of the Scripture) both parties read the Book and do not believe in it and further claim things that are not mentioned therein. (Even thus spoke those who know not) knew the Oneness of Allah through their own forefathers; and it is said this means: they knew the Book of Allah from others. (Allah will judge between them) between the Jews and Christians (on the Day of Resurrection concerning that wherein they differ)."
وَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّنْ مَّنَعَ مَسَاجِدَ ٱللَّهِ أَن يُذْكَرَ فِيهَا ٱسْمُهُ وَسَعَىٰ فِي خَرَابِهَآ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ مَا كَانَ لَهُمْ أَن يَدْخُلُوهَآ إِلاَّ خَآئِفِينَ لَّهُمْ فِي ٱلدُّنْيَا خِزْيٌ وَلَهُمْ فِي ٱلآخِرَةِ عَذَابٌ عَظِيمٌ,"Then He mentioned Tatus Ibn Asipanos al-Rumi, king of the Christians who destroyed Jerusalem, saying: (And who doth greater wrong) in his disbelief (than he who forbideth the approach to the sanctuaries of Allah) Jerusalem (lest His name should be mentioned therein) by declaring Allah's Oneness and calling to prayer, (and striveth for their ruin?) in the ruin of Jerusalem by throwing carrions in it. And this lasted until the reign of 'Umar. (As for such) for the Romans, (it was never meant that they should enter them) Jerusalem (except in fear) hiding from the believers for fear of being killed, for they would be killed if found. (Theirs in the world is ignominy) a chastisement in that their cities, Constantinople, Amorium ('Ammuriyyah) and Rome (Rumiyyah) would be ruined (and theirs in the Hereafter is an awful doom) more severe than the punishment they were subjected to in this world."
وَللَّهِ ٱلْمَشْرِقُ وَٱلْمَغْرِبُ فَأَيْنَمَا تُوَلُّواْ فَثَمَّ وَجْهُ ٱللَّهِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ وَاسِعٌ عَلِيمٌ,"Then Allah mentioned the direction of prayer to Him, saying (Unto Allah belong the East and the West) as a direction of prayer for him who does not know the correct direction of prayer, (and whithersoever ye turn) your faces in prayer after ascertaining the direction, (there is Allah's Countenance) that prayer is performed in Allah's pleasure. This verse was revealed about a group of Companions of the Prophet (pbuh) who prayed whilst travelling in the wrong direction after doing their best to determine the correct direction. It is also said that saying (Unto Allah belong the East and the West) means: the people of the East and the people of the West have one direction of prayer which is the Sacred Precinct, and therefore (there is Allah's Countenance) means: that is the direction of prayer to Allah, (Lo! Allah is All-Embracing) regarding the direction of prayer, (All- Knowing) of their intentions."
وَقَالُواْ ٱتَّخَذَ ٱللَّهُ وَلَداً سُبْحَـٰنَهُ بَل لَّهُ مَا فِي ٱلسَّمَـٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ كُلٌّ لَّهُ قَانِتُونَ,"Then Allah mentions the claims of the Jews and Christians that Ezra and Jesus are the sons of Allah, saying: (And they) the Jews and Christians (say: Allah hath taken unto Himself a Son) Ezra and the Messiah (Jesus). (Be He glorified!) He is far exalted to have a son or partner (Nay) it is not as they say, (but whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth) of creation (is His) are His servants. (All are subservient unto Him) linked to Him by the bond of servitude and the declaration of His Oneness."
بَدِيعُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَإِذَا قَضَىٰ أَمْراً فَإِنَّمَا يَقُولُ لَهُ كُنْ فَيَكُونُ,"(The Originator of the heavens and the earth!) He originated them when they were nothing before. (When He decreeth a thing) when He wants to create a child without a father, like Jesus, (He saith unto it only: Be!) be a child without a father, just like Adam was without a father or mother, (And it is)."
وَقَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ لَوْلاَ يُكَلِّمُنَا ٱللَّهُ أَوْ تَأْتِينَآ آيَةٌ كَذَلِكَ قَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ مِّثْلَ قَوْلِهِمْ تَشَابَهَتْ قُلُوبُهُمْ قَدْ بَيَّنَّا ٱلآيَاتِ لِقَوْمٍ يُوقِنُونَ,"(And those who have no knowledge) who do not know the Oneness of Allah, i.e. the Jews (say: Why doth not Allah speak unto us) directly, (or some sign come unto us) a sign confirming the prophethood of Muhammad (pbuh); for then, we would surely believe? (Even thus, as they now speak, spoke) similar words (those before them) their forefathers. (Their hearts are all alike) their words and hearts are the same. (We have made clear the revelations) the signs: the commands, prohibitions and your traits in the Torah (for people who are sure) who believe."
إِنَّا أَرْسَلْنَاكَ بِٱلْحَقِّ بَشِيراً وَنَذِيراً وَلاَ تُسْأَلُ عَنْ أَصْحَابِ ٱلْجَحِيمِ,"(Lo! We have sent thee) O Muhammad (with the Truth) with the Qur'an and the declaration of the Oneness of Allah, (a bringer of glad tidings) that Paradise shall be for the believers (and a warner) against hell for those who disbelieve in Allah. (And thou wilt not be asked about the owners of hellfire) it is not befitting that you should ask about the dwellers of hell; and it is said that this means: do not ask for the forgiveness of the dwellers of hell."
وَلَنْ تَرْضَىٰ عَنكَ ٱلْيَهُودُ وَلاَ ٱلنَّصَارَىٰ حَتَّىٰ تَتَّبِعَ مِلَّتَهُمْ قُلْ إِنَّ هُدَى ٱللَّهِ هُوَ ٱلْهُدَىٰ وَلَئِنِ ٱتَّبَعْتَ أَهْوَآءَهُمْ بَعْدَ ٱلَّذِي جَآءَكَ مِنَ ٱلْعِلْمِ مَا لَكَ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ مِن وَلِيٍّ وَلاَ نَصِيرٍ,"(And Jews) The Jews of Medina (will not be pleased with thee, nor will Christians) the Christians of Najran, (till thou follow their creed) their religion and direction of prayer. (Say) O Muhammad! (Lo! The guidance of Allah is Guidance) the Religion of Allah is Islam and Allah's direction of prayer is the Ka'bah. (And if thou shouldst follow their desires) their religion and direction of prayer (after the knowledge which hath come unto thee) that the Religion of Allah is Islam and His direction of prayer is the Ka'bah, (then wouldst thou have from Allah) from His chastisement (no protecting friend) no one to benefit you (nor helper) to save you from this chastisement."
ٱلَّذِينَ آتَيْنَاهُمُ ٱلْكِتَـٰبَ يَتْلُونَهُ حَقَّ تِلاَوَتِهِ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِهِ وَمن يَكْفُرْ بِهِ فَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْخَٰسِرُونَ,"Allah then mentioned the believers from among the people of the Book: 'Abdullah Ibn Salam and his companions, Bahirah the Monk and the Negus and his followers, saying: (Those unto whom We have given the Scripture) given knowledge of the Scripture, i.e. the Torah, (who read it with the right reading) describe it as it is and do not alter it: expositing what is lawful and unlawful, its commands and prohibitions to whomever asks them, and they further act according to what is clear and unambiguous and believe in that which is ambiguous therein, (those believe in it) in Muhammad and the Qur'an. (And who disbelieveth in it) in Muhammad and the Qur'an, (those are they who are losers) who are duped in that they lose both this world and the world to come."
يَابَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ ٱذْكُرُواْ نِعْمَتِيَ ٱلَّتِيۤ أَنْعَمْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ وَأَنِّي فَضَّلْتُكُمْ عَلَى ٱلْعَالَمِينَ,"Allah then mentions His favour upon the Children of Israel, saying: (O Children of Israel!) O Children of Jacob (Remember) recollect (My favour wherewith I favoured you) favoured your forefathers by delivering them from Pharaoh and his people as well as by the blessings and bounties that I favoured them with (and how I preferred you) with Islam (to the worlds) the people of your time."
وَٱتَّقُواْ يَوْماً لاَّ تَجْزِي نَفْسٌ عَن نَّفْسٍ شَيْئاً وَلاَ يُقْبَلُ مِنْهَا عَدْلٌ وَلاَ تَنفَعُهَا شَفَاعَةٌ وَلاَ هُمْ يُنصَرُونَ,"(And guard against a day) fear the torment of a day, i.e. the Day of Judgement (when no soul will in anything avail another) no unbelieving soul will be able to drive away anything from another unbelieving soul; it is also said that this means: no righteous soul will be able to drive away anything from another righteous soul; and it is said that this means: no father will be able to drive away anything from his son and no son will be able to drive away Allah's punishment from his father, (nor will compensation be accepted from it) no ransom will be accepted, (nor will intercession be of use to it) no intercessor will intercede for it: not a close angel, a sent messenger or a righteous servant; (nor will they be helped) will be prevented from what they will face."
وَإِذِ ٱبْتَلَىٰ إِبْرَاهِيمَ رَبُّهُ بِكَلِمَاتٍ فَأَتَمَّهُنَّ قَالَ إِنِّي جَاعِلُكَ لِلنَّاسِ إِمَاماً قَالَ وَمِن ذُرِّيَّتِي قَالَ لاَ يَنَالُ عَهْدِي ٱلظَّالِمِينَ,"Allah then mentioned His favour upon Abraham, His close friend, saying: (And when his Lord tried Abraham with some words) He commanded him to fulfil ten traits: five in relation to his head and five to his body, (and he fulfilled them) he complied. It is also said that (And when his Lord tried Abraham with some words) means: with every single word he prayed to Allah, (He said) to him: (Lo! I have appointed you a leader for mankind) a vicegerent that people may emulate you. (He) Abraham (said: And of my offspring) make of my offspring vicegerents that people would emulate? (He) Allah (said: My covenant) with you and My promise to you and the honour and mercy I bestowed upon you (includeth not wrong-doers) from among your offspring; it is also said that this means: My covenant will not include the wrong-doers in the Hereafter but it will include them in this life."
وَإِذْ جَعَلْنَا ٱلْبَيْتَ مَثَابَةً لِّلنَّاسِ وَأَمْناً وَٱتَّخِذُواْ مِن مَّقَامِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ مُصَلًّى وَعَهِدْنَآ إِلَىٰ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَإِسْمَاعِيلَ أَن طَهِّرَا بَيْتِيَ لِلطَّائِفِينَ وَٱلْعَاكِفِينَ وَٱلرُّكَّعِ ٱلسُّجُودِ,"Allah then commanded people to emulate him, saying: (And when We made the House a resort) a place to turn to (for mankind) whereby they can turn and long for (and a sanctuary) for whoever enters it: (Take) it, O community of Muhammad! (as your place of worship the place where Abraham stood (to pray)) a place whereby you turn in prayer. (And We imposed a duty upon) commanded (Abraham and Ishmael: Purify My house) from idols (for those who go around and those who meditate therein) those who live there (and those who bow down and prostrate themselves) those who perform the five daily prayers, regardless of their country of origin."
وَإِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ رَبِّ ٱجْعَلْ هَـٰذَا بَلَداً آمِناً وَٱرْزُقْ أَهْلَهُ مِنَ ٱلثَّمَرَاتِ مَنْ آمَنَ مِنْهُمْ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلآخِرِ قَالَ وَمَن كَفَرَ فَأُمَتِّعُهُ قَلِيلاً ثُمَّ أَضْطَرُّهُ إِلَىٰ عَذَابِ ٱلنَّارِ وَبِئْسَ ٱلْمَصِيرُ,"(And when Abraham prayed: My Lord! Make this a region of security) free of perturbation (and bestow upon its people fruits) different kinds of fruit, (such of them as believe in Allah and the Last Day) in resurrection after death, (He) Allah (answered: As for him who disbelieveth) as well, (I shall leave him in contentment for a while) I shall provide for him a little in this life, (then I shall compel him) force him (to the doom of fire, a hapless journey's end!) to which he shall come."
وَإِذْ يَرْفَعُ إِبْرَٰهِيمُ ٱلْقَوَاعِدَ مِنَ ٱلْبَيْتِ وَإِسْمَٰعِيلُ رَبَّنَا تَقَبَّلْ مِنَّآ إِنَّكَ أَنتَ ٱلسَّمِيعُ ٱلْعَلِيمُ,"(And when Abraham and Ishmael were raising the foundation of the House) built the foundation of the House and Ishmael was helping him and when they finished, they prayed: (Our Lord!) O our Lord! (Accept from us) the building of Your house. (Lo! Thou, only Thou, art the Hearer) of our prayer, (the Knower) of the answer to this prayer; it is also said that this means: the Knower of our intention in building Your house."
رَبَّنَا وَٱجْعَلْنَا مُسْلِمَيْنِ لَكَ وَمِن ذُرِّيَّتِنَآ أُمَّةً مُّسْلِمَةً لَّكَ وَأَرِنَا مَنَاسِكَنَا وَتُبْ عَلَيْنَآ إِنَّكَ أَنتَ ٱلتَّوَّابُ ٱلرَّحِيمُ,"(Our Lord!) O our Lord!

O our Lord (And raise up in their midst) the offspring of Ishmael (a Messenger from among them) from their own lineage (who shall recite unto them Your revelations) the Qur'an, (and shall instruct them in the Scripture) the Qur'an (and in wisdom) the lawful and the prohibited (and shall make them pure) from sins through the declaration of the Oneness of God. (Lo! Thou, only Thou, art the Mighty) Who is vengeful against whosoever does not answer Your Messenger whom You sent to them, (the Wise) in sending the Messenger. And Allah answered his prayers and sent unto them Muhammad (pbuh); and these are the words with which Allah tried him, and he fulfilled them by asking Allah for them in his prayer."
وَمَن يَرْغَبُ عَن مِّلَّةِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ إِلاَّ مَن سَفِهَ نَفْسَهُ وَلَقَدِ ٱصْطَفَيْنَاهُ فِي ٱلدُّنْيَا وَإِنَّهُ فِي ٱلآخِرَةِ لَمِنَ ٱلصَّالِحِينَ,"(And who forsaketh the religion of Abraham) renounces the Religion of Abraham and his practices (save him who befooleth himself?) has ruined himself, lost his mind or is foolish? (Verily We chose him) i.e. Abraham (in the world) by taking him as a friend; as it is said this means: We have chosen him in this world by bestowing upon him prophethood, Islam and goodly offspring, (and lo! In the Hereafter he is among the righteous ones) with his forefathers, the messengers, in Paradise."
إِذْ قَالَ لَهُ رَبُّهُ أَسْلِمْ قَالَ أَسْلَمْتُ لِرَبِّ ٱلْعَالَمِينَ,"(When his Lord said unto him) when he came out of the pit of fire: (Surrender) say specifically: there is no god save Allah! (He said: I have surrendered to the Lord of the Worlds) I submit to the Lord of all the worlds, and declare that Allah is the only One God, without partner. It is also said that when Abraham invited his people to accept that Allah is One without partners, his Lord said unto him: make your Religion and works sincere to Allah; and he answered: I make my Religion and works sincere to the Lord of the worlds. And it is also said that when Abraham was thrown in the Fire, his Lord said unto him: make your religion and works sincere to Allah; he replied: I comply and make my Religion and works sincere to Allah, Lord of all the worlds."
وَوَصَّىٰ بِهَآ إِبْرَاهِيمُ بَنِيهِ وَيَعْقُوبُ يَابَنِيَّ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ ٱصْطَفَىٰ لَكُمُ ٱلدِّينَ فَلاَ تَمُوتُنَّ إِلاَّ وَأَنْتُم مُّسْلِمُونَ,"(The same did Abraham enjoin) enjoined that there is no god except Allah (upon his sons) when he was dying, (and also Jacob) he also enjoined his children with the same: (O my sons! Lo! Allah hath chosen for you the (true) religion) the Religion of Islam; (therefore die not save as men who have surrendered) hold fast to Islam until you die as Muslims, sincere to Him in your worship and in your declaration of divine Oneness."
أَمْ كُنتُمْ شُهَدَآءَ إِذْ حَضَرَ يَعْقُوبَ ٱلْمَوْتُ إِذْ قَالَ لِبَنِيهِ مَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن بَعْدِي قَالُواْ نَعْبُدُ إِلَـٰهَكَ وَإِلَـٰهَ آبَائِكَ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَإِسْمَاعِيلَ وَإِسْحَاقَ إِلَـٰهاً وَاحِداً وَنَحْنُ لَهُ مُسْلِمُونَ,"Then Allah mentioned the dispute among the Jews concerning the religion of Abraham, saying: (Or were ye witnesses) or were you, O assembly of Jews, present (when death came to Jacob) regarding what he enjoined his children, i.e. whether he enjoined them to follow Judaism or Islam, (when he said unto his sons: What will ye worship after me?) after I die? (They said: We shall worship thy God) we worship, (the God of your fathers, Abraham, Ishmael and Isaac, one God) i.e. we worship one God, (and unto Him we have surrendered) we acknowledge to worship Him and declare that there is only one true God."
تِلْكَ أُمَّةٌ قَدْ خَلَتْ لَهَا مَا كَسَبَتْ وَلَكُمْ مَّا كَسَبْتُمْ وَلاَ تُسْأَلُونَ عَمَّا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ,(Those are the people) a group of people (who have passed away) perished. (Theirs is that which they earned) of goodness (and yours is that which ye earn) of goodness. (And ye will not be asked) on the Day of Judgement (of what they used to do) or say.
وَقَالُواْ كُونُواْ هُوداً أَوْ نَصَارَىٰ تَهْتَدُواْ قُلْ بَلْ مِلَّةَ إِبْرَاهِيمَ حَنِيفاً وَمَا كَانَ مِنَ ٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ,"Allah mentioned after this the dispute of the Jews and Christians with the believers, saying: (And they say) i.e. the Jews: (Be Jews) you shall be guided from error (or Christians) and the Christians also say the same, (then ye will be rightly guided. Say) to them, O Muhammad: it is not as you claim: (Nay, but the religion of Abraham, the upright) the Muslim; rather follow the religion of Abraham, the upright, the Muslim, the sincere-only then you will be guided, (and he was not of the idolaters) i.e. he did not follow the religion of the Jews or Christians."
قُولُوۤاْ آمَنَّا بِٱللَّهِ وَمَآ أُنْزِلَ إِلَيْنَا وَمَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَىٰ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَإِسْمَاعِيلَ وَإِسْحَاقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ وَٱلأَسْبَاطِ وَمَآ أُوتِيَ مُوسَىٰ وَعِيسَىٰ وَمَا أُوتِيَ ٱلنَّبِيُّونَ مِن رَّبِّهِمْ لاَ نُفَرِّقُ بَيْنَ أَحَدٍ مِّنْهُمْ وَنَحْنُ لَهُ مُسْلِمُونَ,"Then He taught the believers the path of divine Oneness so that the Jews and Christians had an indication of what this divine Oneness means, saying: (Say (O Muslims): We believe in Allah and that which is revealed unto us) i.e. in Muhammad and the Qur'an (and that which was revealed unto Abraham) i.e. we believe in Abraham and his Scripture, (and Ishmael) and we believe in Ishmael and his Scripture, (and Isaac) and in Isaac and his Scripture, (and Jacob) and in Jacob and his Scripture, (and the tribes) and in the sons of Jacob and their Scriptures, (and that which Moses and Jesus received) i.e. we believe in Moses and the Torah and in Jesus and the Gospel, (and that which the Prophets received) we also believe in all the prophets and their Scriptures (from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them) that Allah sent them as prophets to teach divine Oneness, (and unto Him we have surrendered) we acknowledge that we worship Him and declare that there is only one true God."
فَإِنْ آمَنُواْ بِمِثْلِ مَآ آمَنْتُمْ بِهِ فَقَدِ ٱهْتَدَواْ وَّإِن تَوَلَّوْاْ فَإِنَّمَا هُمْ فِي شِقَاقٍ فَسَيَكْفِيكَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ وَهُوَ ٱلسَّمِيعُ ٱلْعَلِيمُ,"(And if they) i.e. the people of the Book (believe in the like of that which you believe) in all the prophets and their Scriptures (then are they right guided) from error by following the religion of Muhammad and Abraham. (But if they turn away) refuse to believe in all the prophets and their Scriptures, (then are they in schism) in conflict with the true religion, (and Allah will suffice thee (for defence) against them) Allah will lift their burden from you, by killing and expelling them. (And He is the Hearer) of what they say, (the Knower) of their punishment."
صِبْغَةَ ٱللَّهِ وَمَنْ أَحْسَنُ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ صِبْغَةً وَنَحْنُ لَهُ عَابِدونَ,"((We take our) colour from Allah) i.e. follow the Religion of Allah, (and who is better than Allah at colouring) better than the Religion of Allah. (And We are His worshippers) say: we are monotheists and acknowledge that we worship Him and declare that there is only one true God."
قُلْ أَتُحَآجُّونَنَا فِي اللَّهِ وَهُوَ رَبُّنَا وَرَبُّكُمْ وَلَنَآ أَعْمَالُنَا وَلَكُمْ أَعْمَالُكُمْ وَنَحْنُ لَهُ مُخْلِصُونَ,"(Say), O Muhammad, ((unto the People of the Scripture) dispute ye with us) do you argue with us (concerning Allah) concerning the Religion of Allah (when He is our Lord and your Lord?) when Allah is our Lord and yours? (Ours are our works) we have our religion (and yours your work) your religion. (And we are sincere (in our faith) in Him) we acknowledge that we worship Him and declare that there is only one true God."
أَمْ تَقُولُونَ إِنَّ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَإِسْمَاعِيلَ وَإِسْحَـاقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ وَالأَسْبَاطَ كَانُواْ هُوداً أَوْ نَصَارَىٰ قُلْ أَأَنْتُمْ أَعْلَمُ أَمِ ٱللَّهُ وَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّنْ كَتَمَ شَهَادَةً عِندَهُ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ وَمَا ٱللَّهُ بِغَافِلٍ عَمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ,"(Or say ye) O Jews and Christians (that Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac and Jacob, and the tribes) the children of Jacob (were Jews or Christians) as you claim? (Say) to them, O Muhammad! (Do ye know best, or doth Allah?) do you know best about their religion or does Allah? Allah has already informed us that Abraham was neither a Jew nor a Christian. (And who is more unjust) in his disbelief and more insolent and daring vis-à-vis Allah (than he who hideth a testimony which he hath received from Allah) in the Torah concerning the prophethood of this Prophet (pbuh)? (Allah is not unaware) heedless (of what ye do) about concealing your testimony."
تِلْكَ أُمَّةٌ قَدْ خَلَتْ لَهَا مَا كَسَبَتْ وَلَكُمْ مَّا كَسَبْتُمْ وَلاَ تُسْأَلُونَ عَمَّا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ,(Those are a people) a group of people (who have passed away) perished; (theirs is that which they earned) of goodness (and yours is that which ye earn) of goodness. (And ye will not be asked) on the Day of Judgement (of what they used to do) in this world.
سَيَقُولُ ٱلسُّفَهَآءُ مِنَ ٱلنَّاسِ مَا وَلَّٰهُمْ عَن قِبْلَتِهِمُ ٱلَّتِي كَانُواْ عَلَيْهَا قُل للَّهِ ٱلْمَشْرِقُ وَٱلْمَغْرِبُ يَهْدِي مَن يَشَآءُ إِلَىٰ صِرَاطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ,"(The foolish of the people) the ignorant among the Jews and Arab idolaters (will say: What hath turned them) made them change (from the Qiblah which they formerly observed) except that they want to revert to the religion of their ancestors; it is also said that this means: there was no reason to turn from the direction in which they prayed, i.e. Jerusalem? (Say) O Muhammad! (unto Allah belong the East) praying to the Ka'bah (and the West) the prayer that you prayed in the direction of Jerusalem-both are with Allah's command. (He guideth whom He will unto a straight path) He confirms whom He wills on a straight Religion and direction of prayer."
وَكَذَلِكَ جَعَلْنَاكُمْ أُمَّةً وَسَطاً لِّتَكُونُواْ شُهَدَآءَ عَلَى ٱلنَّاسِ وَيَكُونَ ٱلرَّسُولُ عَلَيْكُمْ شَهِيداً وَمَا جَعَلْنَا ٱلْقِبْلَةَ ٱلَّتِي كُنتَ عَلَيْهَآ إِلاَّ لِنَعْلَمَ مَن يَتَّبِعُ ٱلرَّسُولَ مِمَّن يَنقَلِبُ عَلَىٰ عَقِبَيْهِ وَإِن كَانَتْ لَكَبِيرَةً إِلاَّ عَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ هَدَى ٱللَّهُ وَمَا كَانَ ٱللَّهُ لِيُضِيعَ إِيمَانَكُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ بِٱلنَّاسِ لَرَءُوفٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"(Thus) i.e. just as we have honoured you with the Religion of Abraham (Islam) and his direction of prayer (We have appointed you a middle nation) a middlemost community, (that you be witnesses) for the prophets (over mankind, and that the Messenger) Muhammad (pbuh) (may be a witness over you) that you are upright and follow the straight path. (And We appointed) changed (the Qiblah which ye formerly observed) prayed towards for a period of 19 months (only that We might know) see and distinguish (him who followeth the Messenger) concerning the Qiblah, (from him who turneth) reverts (on his heels) to his former religion and direction of prayer. (In truth it) the changing of the Qiblah (was a hard (test) save for those whom Allah guided) whose hearts Allah had protected. (But it was not Allah's purpose that your faith should be in vain) that He thwarts your faith as it was prior to the abrogation of legal rulings; and it is also said that this means: it is not Allah's purpose to thwart your faith but rather His purpose is to abrogate the legal rulings which conduct your faith; and it is also said that this means: Allah did not thwart your prayers towards Jerusalem but He has abrogated the ruling which required you to pray towards Jerusalem, (for Allah is full of pity, Merciful) in that He does not thwart your faith as it was before the abrogation of legal rulings (towards mankind) towards the believers."
قَدْ نَرَىٰ تَقَلُّبَ وَجْهِكَ فِي ٱلسَّمَآءِ فَلَنُوَلِّيَنَّكَ قِبْلَةً تَرْضَاهَا فَوَلِّ وَجْهَكَ شَطْرَ ٱلْمَسْجِدِ ٱلْحَرَامِ وَحَيْثُ مَا كُنْتُمْ فَوَلُّواْ وُجُوِهَكُمْ شَطْرَهُ وَإِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ ٱلْكِتَابَ لَيَعْلَمُونَ أَنَّهُ ٱلْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّهِمْ وَمَا ٱللَّهُ بِغَافِلٍ عَمَّا يَعْمَلُونَ,"Allah then mentions the supplication of His Prophet regarding the changing of the Qiblah towards Mecca, saying: (We have seen the turning of thy face to heaven (for guidance, O Muhammad)) turning your sight to heaven in anticipation of Gabriel coming down to announce the change of the Qiblah. (And now surely We shall make thee turn (in prayer) toward a Qiblah that is dear to thee) that you like, namely, the Qiblah of Abraham. (So turn thy face) when in prayer (towards the Inviolable Place of Worship, and ye (O Muslims), wheresoever ye may be) whether on land or in the sea, (turn your faces (when ye pray)) in prayer (towards it. (Lo! Those who have received the Scripture know that) the Sacred Precinct (is the Truth from their Lord) is the Qiblah of Abraham but they conceal this fact. (And Allah is not unaware) heedless (of what they do) of what they conceal."
وَلَئِنْ أَتَيْتَ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ ٱلْكِتَابَ بِكُلِّ آيَةٍ مَّا تَبِعُواْ قِبْلَتَكَ وَمَآ أَنتَ بِتَابِعٍ قِبْلَتَهُمْ وَمَا بَعْضُهُم بِتَابِعٍ قِبْلَةَ بَعْضٍ وَلَئِنِ ٱتَّبَعْتَ أَهْوَاءَهُم مِّن بَعْدِ مَا جَآءَكَ مِنَ ٱلْعِلْمِ إِنَّكَ إِذَاً لَّمِنَ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ,"(And even if thou broughtest unto those who have received the Scripture all kinds of portents) all the signs they asked of you, (they would not follow your Qiblah) they would not pray towards your Qiblah nor embrace your Religion, (nor canst thou be a follower of their Qiblah) nor can you pray towards the Qiblah of the Jews or Christians; (nor are some of them followers of others) nor are some of them going to pray towards the Qiblah of the Jews and Christians. (And if thou shouldst follow their desires) after being warned and pray towards their Qiblah (after the knowledge which hath come unto you) that the Sacred Precinct is the Qiblah of Abraham, (then surely) if you do that then surely (wert thou of the evil-doers) who harm themselves."
ٱلَّذِينَ آتَيْنَاهُمُ ٱلْكِتَابَ يَعْرِفُونَهُ كَمَا يَعْرِفُونَ أَبْنَاءَهُمْ وَإِنَّ فَرِيقاً مِّنْهُمْ لَيَكْتُمُونَ ٱلْحَقَّ وَهُمْ يَعْلَمُونَ,"Then Allah mentions the believers of the people of the Book, saying: (Those unto whom We gave the Scripture) gave the knowledge of the Torah, 'Abdullah ibn Salam and his followers (recognise) know Muhammad (pbuh) with his description and traits (as they recognise their children) in the midst of other children. (But lo! A party of them) of the people of the Book (knowingly) knowing it to exist in their Book (conceal the Truth) conceal the description and traits of Muhammad (pbuh)."
ٱلْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّكَ فَلاَ تَكُونَنَّ مِنَ ٱلْمُمْتَرِينَ,(It is the Truth from thy Lord (O Muhammad)) that you are a Prophet sent by Allah. (So be not thou of those who waver) who doubt whether they know or not.

(Wheresoever you may be) on land or at sea, (Allah will bring you all together) gather you together and reward you for the good works you performed. (Lo! Allah is Able to do all things) like gathering you together as well as other things."
وَمِنْ حَيْثُ خَرَجْتَ فَوَلِّ وَجْهَكَ شَطْرَ ٱلْمَسْجِدِ ٱلْحَرَامِ وَإِنَّهُ لَلْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّكَ وَمَا ٱللَّهُ بِغَافِلٍ عَمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ,"(And whencesoever you comest forth (for prayer, O Muhammad) turn thy face) in prayer (towards the Inviolable Place of Worship; Lo! It) the Inviolable Place of Worship (is the Truth from your Lord) it is the Qiblah of Abraham, Allah bless him. (And Allah is not unaware) heedless (of what ye do) of what you conceal about the Qiblah of Abraham and other things."

وَلاَ تَقُولُواْ لِمَنْ يُقْتَلُ فِي سَبيلِ ٱللَّهِ أَمْوَاتٌ بَلْ أَحْيَاءٌ وَلَكِن لاَّ تَشْعُرُونَ,"Allah thereafter mentions the saying of the hypocrites apropos the martyrs of Badr, Uhud and all the other battles: "" So-and-so has died and lost all comfort and happiness "" , this in order to aggravate sincere believers, and so Allah says: (And call not those who are slain in the way of Allah) in obedience of Allah, on the Day of Badr or in any other battle ( "" dead "" ) like any other dead people. (Nay they are living) they are rather living like those living in Paradise, being provided with comfort and bounties, (only ye perceive not) you are not aware of the honour bestowed upon them or of their real state."
وَلَنَبْلُوَنَّكُمْ بِشَيْءٍ مِّنَ ٱلْخَوْفِ وَٱلْجُوعِ وَنَقْصٍ مِّنَ ٱلأَمَوَالِ وَٱلأَنفُسِ وَٱلثَّمَرَاتِ وَبَشِّرِ ٱلصَّابِرِينَ,"Then He mentioned His trial to the believer, saying: (And surely We shall try you) test you (with something of fear) fear of the enemy (and hunger) in the years of drought, (and loss of wealth and lives) through killing, death and illnesses (and crops) and the loss of crops;"
ٱلَّذِينَ إِذَآ أَصَابَتْهُم مُّصِيبَةٌ قَالُواْ إِنَّا للَّهِ وَإِنَّـآ إِلَيْهِ رَاجِعُونَ,"but then He said: (but give) O Muhammad (glad tidings to the steadfast, who say, when a misfortune) like the ones I have mentioned (striketh them: lo! We are Allah's) we are the slaves of Allah (and lo! Unto Him we are returning) after we die; and if we are not pleased with His decree, He will not be pleased with our works."
أُولَـٰئِكَ عَلَيْهِمْ صَلَوَاتٌ مِّن رَّبِّهِمْ وَرَحْمَةٌ وَأُولَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْمُهْتَدُونَ,"(Such) those who have these traits (are they on whom are blessings) forgiveness (from their Lord) in this world, (and mercy) in that they are not tormented in the Hereafter.

Al-Safa and al-Marwah) going around al-Safa and al-Marwah (are among the rites of Allah) among the rites of pilgrimage that Allah, Exalted is He, has commanded. (It is therefore no sin) one commits no transgression (for him who is on pilgrimage to the House or visiteth it, to go around them (as the pagan custom is). And he who doeth good of his own accord) and whoever performs extra works other than this obligation of going between al-Safa and al-Marwah, (Lo! Allah is Responsive) accepts such works, (Aware) of your intentions; it is also said that this means: Allah accepts the smallest of your works and His reward is abundant."
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يَكْتُمُونَ مَآ أَنزَلْنَا مِنَ ٱلْبَيِّنَاتِ وَٱلْهُدَىٰ مِن بَعْدِ مَا بَيَّنَّاهُ لِلنَّاسِ فِي ٱلْكِتَابِ أُولَـٰئِكَ يَلعَنُهُمُ ٱللَّهُ وَيَلْعَنُهُمُ ٱللاَّعِنُونَ,"(Those who hide the proofs) the commands, prohibitions and the signs mentioned in the Torah (and the guidance) i.e. the description given there of Muhammad (pbuh) and his feature (which We revealed) exposited, (after We had made it clear) to the Children of Israel (in the Scripture) in the Torah: (such are accursed of Allah) Allah will torment them in the grave (and are accursed of those who have the power to curse) all created beings, save human beings and jinn, will curse them upon hearing their screams from the grave."
إِلاَّ ٱلَّذِينَ تَابُواْ وَأَصْلَحُواْ وَبَيَّنُواْ فَأُوْلَـئِكَ أَتُوبُ عَلَيْهِمْ وَأَنَا التَّوَّابُ الرَّحِيمُ,"(Except such of them as repent) from Judaism (and amend) worship Allah alone without ascribing to Him any partners (and make manifest) the traits and description of Muhammad. (These it is towards whom I relent) overlook their past transgressions. (I am the Relenting) towards those who repent, (the Merciful) towards him who dies in a state of repentance."
إِن الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا وَمَاتُوا وَهُمْ كُفَّارٌ أُولَئِكَ عَلَيْهِمْ لَعْنَةُ ٱللَّهِ وَٱلْمَلاۤئِكَةِ وَٱلنَّاسِ أَجْمَعِينَ,"(Lo! Those who disbelieve, and die while they are disbelievers) in Allah and His Messenger; (on them is the curse of Allah) the torment of Allah (and of the angels) the curse of the angels (and of men combined) the curses directed by believers towards each other will end up as curses on these unbelievers."

وَإِلَـٰهُكُمْ إِلَـٰهٌ وَاحِدٌ لاَّ إِلَـٰهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ ٱلرَّحْمَـٰنُ ٱلرَّحِيمُ,"Allah then declares His Oneness because the unbelievers denied this divine Oneness, saying: (Your God is one God) without son or partner; (there is no God save Him, the Beneficent) the Tender, (the Merciful) the Compassionate."
إِنَّ فِي خَلْقِ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَٱخْتِلاَفِ ٱللَّيْلِ وَٱلنَّهَارِ وَٱلْفُلْكِ ٱلَّتِي تَجْرِي فِي ٱلْبَحْرِ بِمَا يَنفَعُ ٱلنَّاسَ وَمَآ أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مِن مَّآءٍ فَأَحْيَا بِهِ ٱلأَرْضَ بَعْدَ مَوْتِهَا وَبَثَّ فِيهَا مِن كُلِّ دَآبَّةٍ وَتَصْرِيفِ ٱلرِّيَاحِ وَٱلسَّحَابِ ٱلْمُسَخَّرِ بَيْنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ وَٱلأَرْضِ لآيَاتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يَعْقِلُونَ,"Then He mentioned the sign of His divine Oneness, saying: (Lo! In the creation of the heavens and the earth) i.e. in their making; or as it is said: in the making of what is in them, (and the difference of night and day) in the alternation of night and day, and in the increase and decrease of their duration, (and the ships which run upon the sea with that which is of use to men) in their livelihoods, (and the water) rain (which Allah sendeth down from the sky, thereby reviving) through rain (the earth after its death) after suffering by drought and being dried up, (and dispersing) creating (all kinds of beasts) male and female (therein, and the ordinance of the winds) in changing the direction of the wind towards the right and towards the left, coming sometimes from the East and sometimes from the West, sometimes carrying torment and sometimes mercy: (and the clouds obedient) subservient (between heaven and earth) He says: in all these (are signs) indications of the Lord's divine Oneness (for people who have sense) who believe that they are from Allah."
وَمِنَ ٱلنَّاسِ مَن يَتَّخِذُ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ أَندَاداً يُحِبُّونَهُمْ كَحُبِّ ٱللَّهِ وَٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ أَشَدُّ حُبّاً للَّهِ وَلَوْ يَرَى ٱلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوۤاْ إِذْ يَرَوْنَ ٱلْعَذَابَ أَنَّ ٱلْقُوَّةَ للَّهِ جَمِيعاً وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ شَدِيدُ ٱلْعَذَابِ,"Allah mentions after this the unbelievers' love for their objects of worship in this world, and how they disown each other in the Hereafter, saying: (Yet of mankind) i.e. the unbelievers (are some who take unto themselves) who worship (rivals to Allah) idols, (loving them with a love like (that which is the due) of Allah) like the love that sincere believers have for Allah (-Those who believe are stauncher) more lasting (in their love for Allah) than are the unbelievers vis-à-vis their idols; it is also said that this verse was revealed about the hypocrites who buried their gold and silver or hid it in caves; and it is also said that this means: they took their leaders as gods (-that those who do evil had but known) if only the idolaters knew, (when they behold the doom) on the Day of Judgement, (that power) and might and invincibility (belongeth wholly to Allah, and that Allah is severe in punishment!) in the Hereafter-if they knew this, they would certainly have believed in this world."
إِذْ تَبَرَّأَ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱتُّبِعُواْ مِنَ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱتَّبَعُواْ وَرَأَوُاْ ٱلْعَذَابَ وَتَقَطَّعَتْ بِهِمُ ٱلأَسْبَابُ,"(When those who were followed) the leaders (disown those who followed (them)) the lowly among people, (and they behold) both the leaders and the lowly (the doom) in the Hereafter, (and all their aims) the pledges and congeniality that were between them in this world (collapse with them)."
وَقَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱتَّبَعُواْ لَوْ أَنَّ لَنَا كَرَّةً فَنَتَبَرَّأَ مِنْهُمْ كَمَا تَبَرَّءُواْ مِنَّا كَذَلِكَ يُرِيهِمُ ٱللَّهُ أَعْمَالَهُمْ حَسَرَاتٍ عَلَيْهِمْ وَمَا هُم بِخَارِجِينَ مِنَ ٱلنَّارِ,"(And those who were but followers) i.e. the lowly (will say: If a return) to this world (were possible for us, we would disown them) disown the leaders in this world (even as they have disowned us) in the Hereafter. (Thus will Allah show them their own deeds as anguish) as regrets (for them) in the Hereafter, (and they) the leaders and those who followed them (will not emerge from the Fire)."
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّاسُ كُلُواْ مِمَّا فِي ٱلأَرْضِ حَلاَلاً طَيِّباً وَلاَ تَتَّبِعُواْ خُطُوَاتِ ٱلشَّيْطَانِ إِنَّهُ لَكُمْ عَدُوٌّ مُّبِينٌ,"Allah then mentions the lawfulness of cultivating land and raising cattle, saying: (O mankind) O people of Mecca! (Eat of that which is lawful and wholesome) that is not prohibited by Allah (in the earth) of what is cultivated in lands and of cattle, (and follow not the footsteps of the devil) the embellishments and whisperings of the devil concerning the unlawfulness of the cultivation of land and of raising cattle. (Lo! He is an open enemy for you) whose enmity towards you is quite manifest."
إِنَّمَا يَأْمُرُكُمْ بِٱلسُّوۤءِ وَٱلْفَحْشَآءِ وَأَن تَقُولُواْ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ مَا لاَ تَعْلَمُونَ,"(He) the devil (enjoineth upon you only the evil) evil works (and the foul) transgressions, (and that ye should tell) lies (concerning Allah that which ye know not)."
وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمُ ٱتَّبِعُوا مَآ أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ قَالُواْ بَلْ نَتَّبِعُ مَآ أَلْفَيْنَا عَلَيْهِ آبَآءَنَآ أَوَلَوْ كَانَ آبَاؤُهُمْ لاَ يَعْقِلُونَ شَيْئاً وَلاَ يَهْتَدُونَ,"(And when it is said unto them) to the Arab idolaters: (Follow that which Allah hath revealed) follow the lawfulness exposited by Allah concerning what is cultivated and the cattle raised, (they say: We follow that wherein we found our fathers) regarding their unlawfulness. (What! Even though their fathers were wholly unintelligent) with regard to Religion (and had no guidance) to the practice of any prophet, so how could you follow them? It is also said that this means: if their fathers did not understand about things in this world and did not follow the practice of any prophet, then how could you follow them? It is also said that this means: even though their fathers did not understand anything of Religion and were not guided to the practice of any prophet, how could they follow them?"
وَمَثَلُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ كَمَثَلِ ٱلَّذِي يَنْعِقُ بِمَا لاَ يَسْمَعُ إِلاَّ دُعَآءً وَنِدَآءً صُمٌّ بُكْمٌ عُمْيٌ فَهُمْ لاَ يَعْقِلُونَ,"Allah then gave a similitude regarding the unbelievers vis-à-vis Muhammad (pbuh) saying: (The likeness of those who disbelieve) vis-à-vis Muhammad (pbuh) (is as the likeness of one who calleth unto that which heareth nothing) just like camels and sheep with their shepherd: his speech is unintelligible to them when he says to them, for example, eat or drink (except a shout and a cry. Deaf) concerning the Truth, (dumb) regarding the Truth, (blind) to guidance; i.e. they pretend to be deaf, dumb and blind when it comes to the Truth and guidance, (therefore they have no sense) they do not understand Allah's command and the call of the Prophet (pbuh) just as camels and cattle do not comprehend the words of their shepherd."
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ كُلُواْ مِن طَيِّبَاتِ مَا رَزَقْنَاكُمْ وَٱشْكُرُواْ للَّهِ إِن كُنْتُمْ إِيَّاهُ تَعْبُدُونَ,"Then Allah mentions the lawfulness of eating what is cultivated on the land and the meat of cattle, saying: (O ye who believe! Eat of the good things wherewith We have provided you) of the lawful things We have given you, (and render thanks to Allah) for it (if it is (indeed) He whom ye worship) it is also said that this means: if you really intend to worship Allah by declaring these to be unlawful, then do not declare them unlawful, for to worship Allah entails that you declare them to be lawful."
إِنَّمَا حَرَّمَ عَلَيْكُمُ ٱلْمَيْتَةَ وَٱلدَّمَ وَلَحْمَ ٱلْخِنزِيرِ وَمَآ أُهِلَّ بِهِ لِغَيْرِ ٱللَّهِ فَمَنِ ٱضْطُرَّ غَيْرَ بَاغٍ وَلاَ عَادٍ فَلاۤ إِثْمَ عَلَيْهِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"Then Allah exposited what He made unlawful for them, saying: (He hath forbidden you only carrion) which He has commanded to immolate, (and blood) and shed blood, (and swineflesh, and that which hath been immolated to any other than Allah) that which is offered as sacrifice purposefully in any other thing than the Name of Allah, i.e. to idols. (But he who is driven by necessity) compelled to eat carrion (neither craving) neither rebelling nor declaring it lawful (nor transgressing) nor committing highway robbery nor purposefully eating it without being driven by necessity, (it is no sin for him) then such a person, who is compelled to eat it without having his fill and without taking anything with him, has not transgressed. (Lo! Allah is Forgiving) that he ate more than he needs to preserve himself, (Merciful) when He gave him legal dispensation to eat carrion."
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يَكْتُمُونَ مَآ أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ مِنَ ٱلْكِتَابِ وَيَشْتَرُونَ بِهِ ثَمَناً قَلِيلاً أُولَـٰئِكَ مَا يَأْكُلُونَ فِي بُطُونِهِمْ إِلاَّ ٱلنَّارَ وَلاَ يُكَلِّمُهُمُ ٱللَّهُ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ وَلاَ يُزَكِّيهِمْ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,"(Lo! Those who hide anything of the Scripture which Allah hath revealed) what Allah has exposited in the Torah regarding the description and traits of Muhammad, (and purchase) by concealing this (a small gain therewith) a small profit, this was revealed about Ka'b Ibn al-Ashraf, Huyayy Ibn Akhtab and Judayy Ibn Akhtab (they eat into their bellies) they put into their bellies (nothing else than fire) except the unlawful; and it is also said that this means: they eat nothing except that which will turn into fire in their bellies on the Day of Judgement. (And Allah will not speak to them) nicely (on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He make them pure) He will not absolve them of their transgressions; it is also said that this means: He will not commend them in any good way. (Theirs will be a painful doom) a painful torment that will extend to their hearts."
أُولَـٰئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱشْتَرَوُاْ ٱلضَّلاَلَةَ بِٱلْهُدَىٰ وَٱلْعَذَابَ بِٱلْمَغْفِرَةِ فَمَآ أَصْبَرَهُمْ عَلَى ٱلنَّارِ,"(Those are they who purchase error at the price of guidance) they purchased disbelief for the price of faith, (and torment at the price of pardon) Judaism for the price of Islam; it is also said that this means: they chose that which leads to the Fire instead of that which leads to Paradise. (How constant are they in their strife to reach the Fire) how bold are they to delve into the Fire? It is also said that this means: what made them so bold as to enter the Fire? And it is also said: how they indulging indeed in the works of the people of the Fire."
ذَلِكَ بِأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ نَزَّلَ ٱلْكِتَابَ بِٱلْحَقِّ وَإِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱخْتَلَفُواْ فِي ٱلْكِتَابِ لَفِي شِقَاقٍ بَعِيدٍ,"(That is) the torment (because Allah hath revealed the Scripture) He sent down Gabriel with the Qur'an and the Torah (with the Truth) with an exposition of the Truth and falsehood, but they disbelieved. (Lo! Those who find disagreement in the Scripture) those who contravene that which is in the Book regarding the description and traits of Muhammad (pbuh) and further conceal the latter (are in open schism) are too much in disagreement with guidance."
لَّيْسَ ٱلْبِرَّ أَن تُوَلُّواْ وُجُوهَكُمْ قِبَلَ ٱلْمَشْرِقِ وَٱلْمَغْرِبِ وَلَـٰكِنَّ ٱلْبِرَّ مَنْ آمَنَ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلآخِرِ وَٱلْمَلاۤئِكَةِ وَٱلْكِتَابِ وَٱلنَّبِيِّينَ وَآتَى ٱلْمَالَ عَلَىٰ حُبِّهِ ذَوِي ٱلْقُرْبَىٰ وَٱلْيَتَامَىٰ وَٱلْمَسَاكِينَ وَٱبْنَ ٱلسَّبِيلِ وَٱلسَّآئِلِينَ وَفِي ٱلرِّقَابِ وَأَقَامَ ٱلصَّلاةَ وَآتَى ٱلزَّكَاةَ وَٱلْمُوفُونَ بِعَهْدِهِمْ إِذَا عَاهَدُواْ وَٱلصَّابِرِينَ فِي ٱلْبَأْسَآءِ وٱلضَّرَّآءِ وَحِينَ ٱلْبَأْسِ أُولَـٰئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ صَدَقُواْ وَأُولَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْمُتَّقُونَ,"(It is not righteousness) it is not all of righteousness; it is also said that (It is not righteousness) means: it is not faith (that ye merely turn your faces) in prayer (to the East) towards Mecca (and the West) towards Jerusalem; (but righteous is) but faith amounts to agreeing with (he who believeth in Allah) and it is also said: the faithful is he who believes in Allah (and the Last Day) in resurrection after death (and the angels) all the angels (and the Scripture) all the revealed Books (and the prophets) and all the prophets; Allah then mentions the obligated duties after mentioning faith, saying: (and giveth his wealth for love of Him) righteousness after declaring one's faith is that one gives of one's wealth, despite the fact that one loves and desires it and has only a little of it, (to kinsfolk) relatives (and to orphans) orphans of the believers (and the needy) who shy away from asking for assistance (and the wayfarer) the passer-by, the guest (and to those who ask) you to give them from your wealth, (and to set slaves free) those who made a contract to pay for their freedom and those who fight in the way of Allah. After mentioning the obligated duties, Allah mentions the different legal prescriptions, saying: (and observeth proper worship) He says: righteousness, after fulfilling the obligated duties, is to perfect the performance of the five daily prayers (and payeth the poor-due) give the poor what is due to them as well as similar things. (And those who keep their treaty) those who fulfil the pledges that are between them and their Lord or between them and other people (when they make one, and the patient in tribulation) i.e. fear, affliction and hardship (and adversity) illness, pain and hunger (and time of stress) upon engagement in fighting. (Such are they who are sincere) who have fulfilled their pledges. (And such are the God fearing) who refrain from breaking their pledges."
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ كُتِبَ عَلَيْكُمُ ٱلْقِصَاصُ فِي ٱلْقَتْلَى ٱلْحُرُّ بِالْحُرِّ وَٱلْعَبْدُ بِٱلْعَبْدِ وَٱلأُنثَىٰ بِٱلأُنْثَىٰ فَمَنْ عُفِيَ لَهُ مِنْ أَخِيهِ شَيْءٌ فَٱتِّبَاعٌ بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ وَأَدَآءٌ إِلَيْهِ بِإِحْسَانٍ ذٰلِكَ تَخْفِيفٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَرَحْمَةٌ فَمَنِ ٱعْتَدَىٰ بَعْدَ ذٰلِكَ فَلَهُ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,"(O ye who believe! Retaliation is prescribed for you in the matter of the murdered ones; the freeman for the freeman) a freeman who premeditatedly kills another freeman, (and the slave for the slave) a slave who premeditatedly kills another, (and the female for the female) a female who premeditatedly kills another. This verse was revealed regarding two Arab clans but is abrogated by the verse: (… a life for a life) [5:45]. (And for him who is forgiven somewhat by his brother) whoever forgives the killing and takes instead blood money, (prosecution according to usage) Allah commands the person who asks for blood money to claim this money according to practised usage: three years if it is a full blood money, two years if it is half of the blood money, or one year if it is a third (and payment unto him) the person who is required to pay blood money is commanded to give the custodians of the murdered person what is due to them (in kindness) without the need to go to court or making it difficult for them. (This) this pardon (is an alleviation) appeasement (and a mercy from your Lord) towards the killer such that he is not killed. (He who transgresseth after this) after taking the blood money and kills the murderer (will have a painful doom) he shall be killed and will not be forgiven or allowed to pay blood money."
وَلَكُمْ فِي ٱلْقِصَاصِ حَيَٰوةٌ يٰأُولِي ٱلأَلْبَابِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ,"(And there is a life for you in retaliation) a continuation of existence and a lesson, (O men of understanding) those who possess sound minds among people, (that ye may ward off (evil)) that you may ward off killing one another for fear of retaliation."

(A duty for all those who ward off (evil)) those who ascribe no partners to Allah; but this verse is abrogated by that on inheritance."
فَمَن بَدَّلَهُ بَعْدَ مَا سَمِعَهُ فَإِنَّمَا إِثْمُهُ عَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ يُبَدِّلُونَهُ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ,"(And whoso changeth) the will of the deceased person (after he hath heard it-the sin thereof) the onus thereof (is only upon those who change it) and the deceased bears no responsibility. (For Allah is Hearer) of the will and words of the deceased, (Knower) if he transgresses or changes it; it is also said that this means: He knows the deed of the testator. Thus, out of fear of sin, people used to execute the will of a deceased person as it was even when the latter transgressed in that will,"
فَمَنْ خَافَ مِن مُّوصٍ جَنَفاً أَوْ إِثْماً فَأَصْلَحَ بَيْنَهُمْ فَلاَ إِثْمَ عَلَيْهِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"until, that is, the following verse was revealed: (But he who feareth from a testator) knows that the testator has committed (some unjust or sinful clause) purposefully committed a mistake or transgression (and maketh peace between the parties) between the inheritors and the testator, i.e. he corrects what is in the will by reducing any bequest to a maximum of a third of the wealth, (no sin for him) he bears no sin in doing so. (Lo! Allah is Forgiving) He forgives the deceased if he transgresses or makes a mistake, (Merciful) in relation to the deed of the testator; it is also said that this means: He forgives the testator, and He is also merciful because He gave dispensation to reduce bequests to a third and thus commanded that one adhere to fairness."
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ كُتِبَ عَلَيْكُمُ ٱلصِّيَامُ كَمَا كُتِبَ عَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ,"(O ye who believe! Fasting is prescribed for you) for a specific number of days; it is said that this means: fasting is prescribed for you: you abstain from eating and drinking and from sexual intercourse from the dawn prayer or from the time one sleeps before the dawn prayer, (even as it was prescribed for those before you) for the people of the Book, (that ye may ward off (evil)) that you may ward off eating, drinking and sexual intercourse after the last night prayer or before sleeping after the last night prayer. However, this is abrogated by the verses: (It is made lawful for you to go unto your wives on the night of the fast) and (and eat and drink until the white thread becomes distinct to you from the black thread of the dawn)."
أَيَّاماً مَّعْدُودَاتٍ فَمَن كَانَ مِنكُم مَّرِيضاً أَوْ عَلَىٰ سَفَرٍ فَعِدَّةٌ مِّنْ أَيَّامٍ أُخَرَ وَعَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ يُطِيقُونَهُ فِدْيَةٌ طَعَامُ مِسْكِينٍ فَمَن تَطَوَّعَ خَيْراً فَهُوَ خَيْرٌ لَّهُ وَأَن تَصُومُواْ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ إِن كُنْتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ,"((Fast) a certain number of days) 30 days; (and (for) him who is sick among you, or on a journey, (the same) number of other days) let him fast the same number of days he missed; (and for those who can afford it) afford to fast (there is a ransom: the feeding of a man in need-) let him feed a person in need, instead of every day of the fast that he missed, half a measure of wheat. But this is abrogated by Allah's saying: (And whoever of you is present, let him fast the month). It is also said that this means: those who can afford a ransom and are not able to fast, old men and women who are unable to fast, they should feed a needy person, for every missed day of fast in Ramadan, half a measure of wheat. (But whoso doeth good of his own accord) gives more than two pounds, (it is better for him) in terms of reward: (and that ye fast is better for you) than giving ransom (if ye did but know-)"

(And whoever of you is present) in settled areas and not travelling, (let him fast the month. And whoever of you is sick) during the month of Ramadan (or on a journey, (let him fast the same) number of days) at another time. (Allah desireth for your ease) He desires for you the dispensation of breaking the fast while on a journey; it is also said that this means: Allah wants you to break the fast when travelling; (He desireth not hardship for you) He does not desire for you the hardship of fasting while travelling; (and (He desireth) that ye should complete the period) that you should fast when you are back in your settlement the same number of days of fast you broke during your travel, (and that ye should magnify Allah for having guided you) as He guided you to His religion and legal dispensation, (and that peradventure ye may be thankful) so that you be thankful for His giving you this dispensation."

(I answer the prayer of the supplicant when he crieth unto Me. So let them respond to Me) let them obey My Messenger (and believe in Me) and in My Messenger before asking, (in order that they may be led rightfully) so that they may be guided and have their prayers answered."

(They are raiment for you) a repose for you (and you are raiment for them) a repose for them. (Allah is aware that ye were deceiving yourselves in this respect) by having sexual intercourse with them at night (and He hath turned in mercy towards you) He forgave you (and relieved you) from your deception and did not punish you. (So) now that it is made lawful, (hold intercourse with them and seek that which Allah hath ordained for you) to have a righteous child; this verse was revealed about 'Umar Ibn al-Khattab, (and eat and drink) from the time the night falls (until the white thread becometh distinct to you from the black thread of the dawn) i.e. until the light of day becomes distinct to you from the darkness of night. (Then strictly observe the fast till nightfall) the beginning of nightfall; this verse was revealed about Sirmah Ibn Malik Ibn 'Adiyy (and touch them not) do not have sexual intercourse with them, (while you are at your devotions) in pious retreat (in the mosques) whether this is during the day or the night. (These are the limits imposed by Allah) such sexual intercourse is a transgression against Allah, (so approach them not) abstain from having sexual intercourse with your wives, during the day and at night, while you are in such retreats. (Thus Allah expoundeth His revelations) His commands and prohibitions (to mankind) as He has exposited this matter (that they may ward off (evil)) they may ward off transgressing against Him. This verse was revealed about a group of Companions of Allah's Messenger (pbuh) among whom were 'Ali Ibn Abi Talib and 'Ammar Ibn Yasir, who were in retreat in the mosque and used to go to their wives whenever they needed them, and then take a ritual bath and return to the mosque. Henceforth but they were forbidden to do so."
وَلاَ تَأْكُلُوۤاْ أَمْوَالَكُمْ بَيْنَكُمْ بِٱلْبَاطِلِ وَتُدْلُواْ بِهَا إِلَى ٱلْحُكَّامِ لِتَأْكُلُواْ فَرِيقاً مِّنْ أَمْوَالِ ٱلنَّاسِ بِٱلإِثْمِ وَأَنْتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ,"The following was revealed about 'Abdan Ibn Ashwa' [al-Hadrami] and Imra' al-Qays [Ibn 'Abis]: (And eat not up your property among yourselves in vanity) through oppression, theft, usurpation, perjury, and other forbidden means, (nor seek by it to gain the hearing of the judges that you may knowingly devour a portion of the property of others wrongfully) through perjury; Imra' al-Qays admitted taking the money when this verse was revealed."
يَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ ٱلأَهِلَّةِ قُلْ هِيَ مَوَاقِيتُ لِلنَّاسِ وَٱلْحَجِّ وَلَيْسَ ٱلْبِرُّ بِأَن تَأْتُواْ ٱلْبُيُوتَ مِن ظُهُورِهَا وَلَـٰكِنَّ ٱلْبِرَّ مَنِ ٱتَّقَىٰ وَأْتُواْ ٱلْبُيُوتَ مِنْ أَبْوَابِهَا وَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ,"(They ask thee (O Muhammad), of new moons) they ask you about the increase and decrease of the moon. (Say) O Muhammad! (They are fixed seasons for mankind) they are signs for people so that they pay back their debts and know the waiting periods of their women and the timing of their fast and the breaking of their fast (and for the pilgrimage) and for the timing of pilgrimage. This verse was revealed about Mu'adh Ibn Jabal when he asked the Prophet (pbuh) about the timing of the pilgrimage. (It is not righteousness) it is not an act of obedience or God-fearing (that ye go to houses by the backs thereof) during ritual consecration (ihram), (but the righteous man) the obedient person during the time of ritual consecration (is he who wardeth off (evil)) hunting and other things. (So go to the houses) enter the houses (by the gates thereof) by the gates you used to enter, (and observe your duty to Allah) fear Allah during the time of ritual consecration, (that ye may be successful) so that you will be spared Allah's wrath and punishment. This verse was revealed about a group of Companions of the Prophet (pbuh) from the tribes of Kinanah and Khuza'ah, who used to enter their houses, during the time of ritual consecration, from the back or from the roof, as was the habit during the pre-Islamic era."

(And fight not with them) do not initiate a fight with them (at the Inviolable Place of Worship) in the Sacred Precinct (until they attack you there) until they initiate a fight with you in the Sacred Precinct, (but if they attack you (there)) first (then slay them. Such is the reward of disbelievers) i.e. death is their reward."
فَإِنِ ٱنتَهَوْاْ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"(But if they desist) from their disbelief, association of partners with Allah and turn to Allah (then lo! Allah is Forgiving) towards those who turn to Him, (Merciful) towards those who die in a state of repentance."

(If they desist) from fighting you in the Sacred Precinct, (then let there be no hostility) you are not allowed to kill them (except against wrong-doers) except those who start the fight against you."

(And observe your duty to Allah) and fear Allah to begin with, (and know that Allah is with those who ward off (evil)) He assists the pious by giving them victory."

(Lo! Allah loveth the beneficent) who spend in His cause. The verses from (Fight in the way of Allah against those who fight against you) to (and do good. Lo! Allah loveth the beneficent) were revealed about the Companions who were in ritual consecration with the Prophet (pbuh) on their way to perform the lesser pilgrimage after the year of al-Hudaybiyyah."

(And if ye are prevented) from performing the pilgrimage or the lesser pilgrimage because of enemies or ill-health, (then send such gifts as can be obtained with ease) then you should offer whatever gifts you can obtain: a sheep, cow or camel in order to leave the Sacred Precinct, (and shave not your heads) if you are prevented (until the gifts) that you have sent (have reached their destination) where it is going to be immolated. (And whoever among you is sick) and cannot remain in the place where he is, then he can return home before his gift reaches its destination (or hath an ailment of the head) or if his head is infested with lice, he should shave it. This verse was revealed about Ka'b Ibn 'Ujrah who shaved his hair when still in a state of ritual consecration because it was infested with lice, (must pay ransom of fasting) the ransom is to fast three days (or almsgiving) to six needy people from the inhabitants of Mecca (or offering) a sheep to be sent to the place of immolation. (And if ye are in safety) from the enemy and you have recovered from your sickness, then you should make up that which Allah has made obligatory upon you in the following year, whether it is a question of the pilgrimage or the lesser pilgrimage, (then whoever contenteth himself with) perfume and clothes after (the visit) the lesser pilgrimage and until he engages in ritual consecration (for the Pilgrimage (shall give) such gifts) then he should offer a sacrifice for making 'Umrah before Hajj (dam al-tamattu') and a sacrifice for doing Hajj and 'Umrah simultaneously (dam al-qaran wa'l-mut'a), whether it is a sheep, cow or camel (as can be had with ease. And whoever cannot find (such gifts)) either a sheep, cow or camel, (then a fast of three days) a fast of three consecutive days (while on the pilgrimage) in the ten days of the pilgrimage, the last of which being the Day of 'Arafah, (and of seven when ye have returned) on your way to your families or after you have returned to your families; (that is, ten in all) in exchange for the gifts."

(And whatsoever good ye do) whatever you abstain from whether it is lewdness, abuse or angry conversation in the Sacred Precinct (Allah knoweth it) Allah will accept it. (So make provision for yourselves) O people of sound minds, from the provision of this world; Allah says here: take from the provisions of this world, O people of sound minds, what is enough to spare you from asking others, otherwise just trust in Allah; (for the best provision to ward off evil) for trust in Allah is the best provision in this world. (Therefore keep your duty unto Me) fear Me in the Sacred Precinct, (O men of understanding). This verse was revealed about some people from the Yemen who used to perform the pilgrimage without taking any provisions with them. As a consequence, they used to wrongfully obtain provisions from the settlements they found on their way and hence Allah now prohibited them from doing so."

This was revealed about a group of people who were against buying and selling in the Sacred Precinct, and so legal dispensation was given to allow it. (But, when you press on in the multitude from 'Arafat) when you return from 'Arafat to the Sacred monument, (remember Allah) with your heart and tongue (by the Sacred monument. Remember Him as He hath guided you, although before) before Muhammad (pbuh) the Qur'an and Islam (ye were of the astray) among the unbelievers."

(Lo! Allah is Forgiving) of those who repent, (Merciful) towards those who die in a state of repentance. This was revealed about a group of people called the “Hamsiyyun” who did not want to press on from the Inviolable Place of Worship to 'Arafat during their pilgrimage. Allah warned them against this, commanding them to go to 'Arafat and then return from there."

(But of mankind is he who saith) on the standing site: (“Our Lord! Give unto us in the world,) camels, cows, sheep, male and female slaves and wealth” (and he hath no portion in the Hereafter) of Paradise by performing the pilgrimage."

(Allah is swift in reckoning) Allah says: when He takes people to task, His reckoning is swift; it is also said that this means: swift in His protection. It is said that this means: His punishment is severe towards those who show off in their devotional works."

(Then whoso hasteneth (in departure)) to return to his family (by two days) after the day of immolation, (it is no sin for him) by this hastening, (and whoso delayeth) it to the third day, (it is no sin for him) by this delay; it is said that this means: there is no reproach on him because of this delay and he shall leave with his sins forgiven; (that is for him who wardeth off (evil)) He says: hastening departure is for him who avoids hunting until the third day. (Be careful of your duty to Allah) He says: fear Allah in taking what is hunted until the third day, (and know that unto Him ye will be gathered) after you die"

(Hell will settle his account) his destination will be hell, (an evil resting place).

This person used to say to him that he loved him and that he was entirely with him in secret and in the open, and used to give his oath to this effect. But he was a hypocrite and it is alleged that he burned someone's crops and killed a donkey belonging to others."

This was revealed about Suhayb Ibn Sinan and his companions. He ransomed himself from the Meccans with his money; (and Allah hath compassion on (His) bondmen) those who were killed in Mecca. This was revealed about the parents of 'Ammar Ibn Yasir (Yasir and Sumayyah) and others who were killed by the Meccan idolaters."

(But those who ward off) disbelief and ascribing partners to Allah: i.e. Salman and his fellow believers (will be above them) in this world by having a strong argument against them and also by having status and standing (on the Day of Resurrection. Allah giveth) abundant wealth (without stint) without faltering or affectation; it is also said that He gives to whoever He wills in Paradise without stint (to whom He will)."

(And only those unto whom (the Scripture) was given differed concerning it) concerning the Religion and Muhammad (pbuh) (after clear proofs had come unto them) clear proofs from their own Scripture, (through hatred one of another) out of resentful envy from their part and this is why they disbelieved in it. (And Allah by His will guided those who believe) by means of the prophets (unto the Truth of that concerning which they differed) in Religion. It is also said that this means: Allah protected the believers by means of the prophets from that which they differed over in matters of Religion, and directed them from falsehood to the Truth. (Allah guideth whom He will) whomever deserves it; and it is also said that this means: Allah holds firm whomever He wills by His grace and will (unto a straight path) unto an established religion that He is pleased with."
أَمْ حَسِبْتُمْ أَن تَدْخُلُواْ ٱلْجَنَّةَ وَلَمَّا يَأْتِكُم مَّثَلُ ٱلَّذِينَ خَلَوْاْ مِن قَبْلِكُم مَّسَّتْهُمُ ٱلْبَأْسَآءُ وَٱلضَّرَّآءُ وَزُلْزِلُواْ حَتَّىٰ يَقُولَ ٱلرَّسُولُ وَٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ مَعَهُ مَتَىٰ نَصْرُ ٱللَّهِ أَلاۤ إِنَّ نَصْرَ ٱللَّهِ قَرِيبٌ,"(Or think ye) O group of believers!-referring here to 'Uthman [Ibn 'Affan] and his fellow believers-(that ye will enter Paradise while yet there hath not come unto you the like of (that which came to) those who passed away before you?) i.e. without being tried as were the believers who came before you. (Affliction) fear, calamities, hardships (and adversity) sickness, pain and hunger (befell them) visited them, (they were shaken as with an earthquake) in hardship, (till the Messenger (of Allah)) until their Messenger (and those who believed along with him) those who believed in him (said: When cometh Allah's help) over the enemy? Allah said to that Prophet: (Now surely Allah's help) over your enemy by means of your safety (is near)."
يَسْأَلُونَكَ مَاذَا يُنْفِقُونَ قُلْ مَآ أَنْفَقْتُمْ مِّنْ خَيْرٍ فَلِلْوَالِدَيْنِ وَٱلأَقْرَبِينَ وَٱلْيَتَامَىٰ وَٱلْمَسَاكِينِ وَٱبْنِ ٱلسَّبِيلِ وَمَا تَفْعَلُواْ مِنْ خَيْرٍ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ بِهِ عَلِيمٌ,"(They ask thee (O Muhammad)) and this was before the verse of inheritance was revealed (what they shall spend) to whom they should give in charity. (Say: That which ye spend for good) of your wealth ((must go) to parents and near kindred) later, giving charity to parents was abrogated by the verse on inheritance (and orphans) He says: give in charity to the orphans (and the needy) the needy among people (and the wayfarer) the guest who drops by. (And whatsoever good ye do) whatever wealth you spend on these, (lo! Allah is Aware of it) Allah knows it as He knows your intention and He will reward you for it."
كُتِبَ عَلَيْكُمُ ٱلْقِتَالُ وَهُوَ كُرْهٌ لَّكُمْ وَعَسَىٰ أَن تَكْرَهُواْ شَيْئاً وَهُوَ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ وَعَسَىٰ أَن تُحِبُّواْ شَيْئاً وَهُوَ شَرٌّ لَّكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ وَأَنْتُمْ لاَ تَعْلَمُونَ,"(Warfare is ordained for you) in times of a general call to arms with the Prophet (pbuh) (though it is hateful unto you) hard on you; (but it may happen that ye hate a thing) fighting in the way of Allah (which is good for you) in that you obtain martyrdom and spoils, (and it may happen that ye love a thing) abstaining from fighting in the way of Allah (which is bad for you) in that you will not obtain martyrdom or spoils. (And Allah knoweth) that fighting in His way is better for you, (ye know not) that abstention from fighting in His way is bad for you. This was revealed about Sa'd Ibn Abi Waqqas, al-Miqdad Ibn al-Aswad and their associates. It was then revealed regarding 'Abdullah Ibn Jahsh and his companions who killed 'Amr Ibn al-Hadrami and their asking about warfare during the sacred month-in reference here to Rajab: i.e. the last afternoon of Jumada II, before seeing the moon of Rajab-for the unbelievers had censored them from doing so."
يَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ ٱلشَّهْرِ ٱلْحَرَامِ قِتَالٍ فِيهِ قُلْ قِتَالٌ فِيهِ كَبِيرٌ وَصَدٌّ عَن سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ وَكُفْرٌ بِهِ وَٱلْمَسْجِدِ ٱلْحَرَامِ وَإِخْرَاجُ أَهْلِهِ مِنْهُ أَكْبَرُ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ وَٱلْفِتْنَةُ أَكْبَرُ مِنَ ٱلْقَتْلِ وَلاَ يَزَالُونَ يُقَاتِلُونَكُمْ حَتَّىٰ يَرُدُّوكُمْ عَن دِينِكُمْ إِن اسْتَطَاعُواْ وَمَن يَرْتَدِدْ مِنْكُمْ عَن دِينِهِ فَيَمُتْ وَهُوَ كَافِرٌ فَأُوْلـٰئِكَ حَبِطَتْ أَعْمَالُهُمْ فِي ٱلدُّنْيَا وَٱلآخِرَةِ وَأُوْلـٰئِكَ أَصْحَابُ ٱلنَّارِ هُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ,"And so Allah said: (They question thee (O Muhammad) with regard to warfare in the sacred month) about waging war in the month of Rajab. (Say: Warfare therein) in the month of Rajab (is a great (transgression)) deserving a great punishment, (but to turn (men) from the way of Allah) but preventing people from the Religion of Allah and His obedience, (and to disbelieve in Him and in the Inviolable Place of Worship) and turning people away from the Inviolable Place of Worship, (and to expel its people from it, is a greater sin) deserving a greater punishment (with Allah) than the killing of 'Amr Ibn al-Hadrami; (for persecution) associating partners with Allah (is worse than slaughter) the slaughter of 'Amr Ibn al-Hadrami. (And they), the people of Mecca, (will not cease from fighting against you till they have made you renegades from your religion) the religion of Islam, (if they can) if they are able to do so. (And whoso becometh a renegade) whoever renounces Islam (and dieth in his disbelief: such are they whose works have fallen) their works are thwarted and their good deeds rejected (both in the world and the Hereafter) and they will not be rewarded in the Hereafter. (And such are rightful owners of the Fire) the people of hell: (they will abide therein forever) they will neither die nor leave it."
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَٱلَّذِينَ هَاجَرُواْ وَجَٰهَدُواْ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ أُوْلـٰئِكَ يَرْجُونَ رَحْمَتَ ٱللَّهِ وَٱللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"The following was also revealed about 'Abdullah Ibn Jahsh and his companions: (Lo! Those who believe) in Allah and His Messenger, (and those who emigrate) from Mecca to Medina (and strive in the way of Allah) by killing the unbeliever 'Amr Ibn al-Hadrami, (these have hope in Allah's mercy) they shall obtain Allah's Garden. (And Allah is Forgiving) of what they have done, (Merciful) towards them, since He did not punish them."

This was revealed about 'Umar Ibn al-Khattab who prayed: “O Allah! Show us Your judgement regarding alcoholic drinks!” So Allah said to Muhammad (pbuh): (Say) O Muhammad! (in both is great sin) this is after they were declared unlawful, (and (some) utility for men) by means of their trading, i.e. before they were unlawful; (but the sin of them) after their being declared unlawful (is greater than their usefulness) before they were made unlawful; and then both were prohibited. (And they ask thee what they ought to spend). This was revealed about 'Amr Ibn al-Jamuh who asked the Prophet (pbuh): “What should we spend from our wealth”. Allah told His Prophet: they ask you about what they should spend from their wealth. (Say: That which is superfluous) that which is in surplus to your sustenance requirements and of food for your dependents. But this was abrogated by those verses on the poor-due. (Thus Allah maketh plain to you (the) revelations) the commands and prohibitions and the insignificance of this world, (that ye may reflect) that it is evanescent."
فِي ٱلدُّنْيَا وَٱلآخِرَةِ وَيَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ ٱلْيَتَامَىٰ قُلْ إِصْلاَحٌ لَّهُمْ خَيْرٌ وَإِنْ تُخَالِطُوهُمْ فَإِخْوَانُكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ ٱلْمُفْسِدَ مِنَ ٱلْمُصْلِحِ وَلَوْ شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ لأَعْنَتَكُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ,"(Upon the world and the Hereafter) that it is lasting. (And they question thee concerning orphans). This was revealed about 'Abdullah Ibn Rawahah who asked the Prophet (pbuh) about whether it was lawful to share food, drink and shelter with orphans. Allah told His Prophet: they ask you about sharing food, drink and shelter with orphans, (Say) O Muhammad: (To improve their lot) and their wealth (is best) rather than not sharing with them. (And if you mingle your affairs with theirs) as regards food, drink and shelter, (then (they are) your brothers) in Religion and you should therefore safeguard their shares. (And Allah knoweth him who spoileth) the wealth of orphans (from him who improveth) their wealth. (Had Allah willed He could have overburdened you) He could have forbidden such sharing. (Indeed Allah is Mighty) and takes revenge against whoever spoils the wealth of orphans, (Wise) ruling that the wealth of orphans should be improved."
وَلاَ تَنْكِحُواْ ٱلْمُشْرِكَاتِ حَتَّىٰ يُؤْمِنَّ وَلأَمَةٌ مُّؤْمِنَةٌ خَيْرٌ مِّن مُّشْرِكَةٍ وَلَوْ أَعْجَبَتْكُمْ وَلاَ تُنْكِحُواْ ٱلْمُشِرِكِينَ حَتَّىٰ يُؤْمِنُواْ وَلَعَبْدٌ مُّؤْمِنٌ خَيْرٌ مِّن مُّشْرِكٍ وَلَوْ أَعْجَبَكُمْ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ يَدْعُونَ إِلَى ٱلنَّارِ وَٱللَّهُ يَدْعُوۤاْ إِلَى ٱلْجَنَّةِ وَٱلْمَغْفِرَةِ بِإِذْنِهِ وَيُبَيِّنُ آيَاتِهِ لِلنَّاسِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَذَكَّرُونَ,"(Wed not idolatresses). This was revealed about Marthad Ibn Abi Marthad Al-Ghanawi who wanted to marry an idolatress woman by the name of 'Inaq. Allah prohibited such marriage, saying: do not marry idolatresses women (till they believe) in Allah; (for lo! A believing bondwoman) marrying a believing slave woman (is better than an idolatress) who is a free woman (though she pleases you) though you may like her comeliness and beauty; (and give not your daughters in marriage to idolaters till they believe) in Allah, (for lo! A believing slave) Allah says: giving your daughters in marriage to a believing slave (is better than an idolater) is better than your daughter marrying an idolater who is free (though he pleases you) though his body and strength may please you. (These invite unto the Fire) they invite to disbelief and to works that lead to hell, (and Allah inviteth unto the Garden) by means of His divine Oneness, (and unto forgiveness) through repentance (by His grace) by His leave, (and He expoundeth thus His revelations) His commands and prohibitions regarding marriage (to mankind that they may remember) so that they may take admonition and refrain from unlawful marriage."
وَيَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ ٱلْمَحِيضِ قُلْ هُوَ أَذًى فَٱعْتَزِلُواْ ٱلنِّسَآءَ فِي ٱلْمَحِيضِ وَلاَ تَقْرَبُوهُنَّ حَتَّىٰ يَطْهُرْنَ فَإِذَا تَطَهَّرْنَ فَأْتُوهُنَّ مِنْ حَيْثُ أَمَرَكُمُ ٱللَّهُ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُحِبُّ ٱلتَّوَّابِينَ وَيُحِبُّ ٱلْمُتَطَهِّرِينَ,"(They question thee (O Muhammad) concerning menstruation) this was revealed about Abu'l-Dahdah who asked the Prophet (pbuh) about it. Allah said to His Prophet: they ask you about sexual intercourse during menstruation, (Say) O Muhammad: (it is harmful) it is filth and unlawful, (so keep away from women at such time) so refrain from having sexual intercourse during menstruation (and go not unto them) do not have sex with them (till they are cleansed) of menstruation. (And when they have purified themselves) and have had a major ritual ablution (ghusl), (then go in unto them) you may have sex with them (as Allah hath enjoined upon you) as you were dispensed to do before, i.e. penetration ought to be in the pudendum. (Truly Allah loveth those who turn unto Him) those who repent of transgression (and loveth those who have a care for cleanness) those who have a care for turning away from transgression and filth."
نِسَآؤُكُمْ حَرْثٌ لَّكُمْ فَأْتُواْ حَرْثَكُمْ أَنَّىٰ شِئْتُمْ وَقَدِّمُواْ لأَنْفُسِكُمْ وَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَٱعْلَمُوۤاْ أَنَّكُمْ مُّلاَقُوهُ وَبَشِّرِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,"(Your women are a tilth for you (to cultivate)) He says: the vulvas of your wives are plantations for your offspring (so go to your tilth) your plantations (as ye will) as you please, from behind or front as long as the penetration is in the pudendum, (and send (good deeds) before you for your souls) righteous children, (and fear Allah) regarding penetrating your wives in their anus or having sex with them during menstruation, (and know that ye will (one day) meet Him) that you will see Him after you die and He will reward you according to your deeds. (Give glad tidings to believers (O Muhammad)) Allah says: give glad tidings, O Muhammad, to the believers, who ward off penetrating their wives in their anus and further abstain from having sex with them when they are menstruating, that Paradise will be theirs."
وَلاَ تَجْعَلُواْ ٱللَّهَ عُرْضَةً لأَيْمَانِكُمْ أَن تَبَرُّواْ وَتَتَّقُواْ وَتُصْلِحُواْ بَيْنَ ٱلنَّاسِ وَٱللَّهُ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ,"(And make not Allah, by your oaths, a hindrance) a reason by means of which you make your oaths. This was revealed about 'Abdullah Ibn Rawahah who swore not to show kindness to his sister and her husband and not to speak with them or make up between them. But Allah warned him against doing so, saying: do not make Allah a reason by means of which you make oaths, (to your being righteous) that you should not honour your oath (and observing your duty unto Him) and ward off severing ties of kinship (and making peace) and not make peace (among mankind). He says: return to that which is better for you and make amend for your oaths; it is also said that this means: avoid making oaths by Allah about not showing kindness to anyone and your not making peace between people. (For Allah is Hearer) of your oath to stop showing kindness to people, (Knower) of your intentions and the amends that will absolve you from your oaths."
لاَّ يُؤَاخِذُكُمُ ٱللَّهُ بِٱلَّلغْوِ فِيۤ أَيْمَانِكُمْ وَلَـٰكِن يُؤَاخِذُكُم بِمَا كَسَبَتْ قُلُوبُكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ غَفُورٌ حَلِيمٌ,"(Allah will not take you to task for that which is unintentional in your oaths) by imposing amends for unintentional oaths such as saying: “No, by Allah” or “Yes indeed, by Allah” upon buying and selling and upon other instances of idle talk. (But He will take you to task for that which your hearts have garnered) what is hidden in your hearts. (And Allah is Forgiving) of your unintentional oaths, (Clement) in that He does not hasten punishment upon you; it is also said: idle talk is an oath for committing transgression. If one refrains from it and makes amends, then Allah does not take one to task for it; but if one does not refrain from so doing, then Allah will take one to task for it."
لِّلَّذِينَ يُؤْلُونَ مِن نِّسَآئِهِمْ تَرَبُّصُ أَرْبَعَةِ أَشْهُرٍ فَإِنْ فَآءُو فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"(Those who forswear their wives) those who abstain from having sex with their wives because of an oath they have made, should not touch them for a period of four months (may wait up to four months) they should wait four months; (then, if they change their mind) if they have sex with them before the elapse of four months, (lo! Allah is Forgiving) that they have not honoured their oath, provided they repent, (Merciful) in that He made the amends due on them clear."
وَإِنْ عَزَمُواْ ٱلطَّلاَقَ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ,"(And if they decide upon divorce) have actually divorced and honoured their oaths ((let them remember that) Allah is Hearer) of one's oath, (Knower) of the fact that one's wife has been divorced through one single pronouncement of divorce after a period of fourth months and through honouring the oath that was made. This verse was revealed about a man who swore not to have sex with his wife for four months or longer. If this man had honoured his oath, his wife would have been considered divorced from him, one single act of divorce; if, on the other hand, he had sex with her before the elapse of this period, he should make amends for breaking his oath."
وَٱلْمُطَلَّقَاتُ يَتَرَبَّصْنَ بِأَنْفُسِهِنَّ ثَلاَثَةَ قُرُوۤءٍ وَلاَ يَحِلُّ لَهُنَّ أَن يَكْتُمْنَ مَا خَلَقَ ٱللَّهُ فِيۤ أَرْحَامِهِنَّ إِن كُنَّ يُؤْمِنَّ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلآخِرِ وَبُعُولَتُهُنَّ أَحَقُّ بِرَدِّهِنَّ فِي ذَلِكَ إِنْ أَرَادُوۤاْ إِصْلاَحاً وَلَهُنَّ مِثْلُ ٱلَّذِي عَلَيْهِنَّ بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ وَلِلرِّجَالِ عَلَيْهِنَّ دَرَجَةٌ وَٱللَّهُ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ,"(Women who are divorced) through one or two pronouncements of divorce (shall wait) shall wait a certain time called the waiting period, (keeping themselves apart, three (monthly) courses) for three menstruation periods. (And it is not lawful for them that they should conceal) their pregnancy (that which Allah hath created in their wombs) of offspring (if they are believers in Allah and the Last Day. And their husbands would do better to take them back) to take them back as their wives (in that case) during the waiting period or if they are pregnant (if they desire reconciliation.) This is because in the early period of Islam, when a man divorced his wife via one or two pronouncements of divorce, he had a better right to take her back after the lapse of the waiting period, before her marrying again. Later, the right to take one's wife back was abrogated by the saying of Allah: (Divorce must be pronounced twice). Similarly, a man had a better right to take his wife back if she were pregnant, even if he had pronounced her divorce a thousand times. This was however abrogated by Allah's saying: (divorce them for their (legal) period) [65:1]. (And they (women) have rights) and inviolability with their husbands (similar to those) of their husbands (over them in kindness) in kind companionship and intercourse, (and men are a degree above them) in relation to the reasoning faculty, inheritance, blood money, as witnesses in court and also that which they owe them in terms of expenditure and service. (Allah is Mighty) in that He is vengeful vis-à-vis whoever leaves that which is between a husband and wife of rights and inviolability, (Wise) regarding that which He has ruled between them."
ٱلطَّلَٰقُ مَرَّتَانِ فَإِمْسَاكٌ بِمَعْرُوفٍ أَوْ تَسْرِيحٌ بِإِحْسَٰنٍ وَلاَ يَحِلُّ لَكُمْ أَن تَأْخُذُواْ مِمَّآ آتَيْتُمُوهُنَّ شَيْئاً إِلاَّ أَن يَخَافَآ أَلاَّ يُقِيمَا حُدُودَ ٱللَّهِ فَإِنْ خِفْتُمْ أَلاَّ يُقِيمَا حُدُودَ ٱللَّهِ فَلاَ جُنَاحَ عَلَيْهِمَا فِيمَا ٱفْتَدَتْ بِهِ تِلْكَ حُدُودُ ٱللَّهِ فَلاَ تَعْتَدُوهَا وَمَن يَتَعَدَّ حُدُودَ ٱللَّهِ فَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلظَّٰلِمُونَ,"(Divorce must be pronounced twice) He says: the divorce in which a man is entitled to take back his wife is pronounced once on two separate occasions (and then (a woman) must be retained) before she is pronounced divorced a third time and before performing major ritual ablution from the third menstruation (in honour) with kind companionship and intercourse (or released in kindness) or divorced a third time with such kindness as restores her rights. (And it is not lawful for you that ye take from women aught of that which ye have given them) of dowry; (except (in the case) when both arbiters) when the husband and wife both know that she wants to ransom her divorce (fear that they may not be able to keep the limits (imposed by) Allah) the rulings of Allah regulating the relationship between husband and wife. (And if ye fear) if you know (that they may not be able to keep the limits (imposed by) Allah) the rulings of Allah regulating the relationship between husband and wife, (in that case it is no sin for either of them) and especially the husband (if the woman ransom herself) if the husband takes what the woman ransoms herself with, out of the generosity of her soul. This verse was revealed about Thabit Ibn Qays Ibn Shammas whose wife Jamilah was the daughter of 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy Ibn Salul, chief of the hypocrites. This woman ransomed her divorce from her husband by giving him back what he gave her as dowry. (These are the limits of Allah) the rulings of Allah regulating the relationship between husband and wife, (Transgress them not) do not step beyond that which Allah has prohibited. (For whoso transgresseth Allah's limits) steps beyond them: (such are wrong-doers) harmful to themselves."
فَإِنْ طَلَّقَهَا فَلاَ تَحِلُّ لَهُ مِن بَعْدُ حَتَّىٰ تَنْكِحَ زَوْجاً غَيْرَهُ فَإِن طَلَّقَهَا فَلاَ جُنَاحَ عَلَيْهِمَآ أَن يَتَرَاجَعَآ إِن ظَنَّآ أَن يُقِيمَا حُدُودَ ٱللَّهِ وَتِلْكَ حُدُودُ ٱللَّهِ يُبَيِّنُهَا لِقَوْمٍ يَعْلَمُونَ,"Allah then went back to His saying: (Divorce must be pronounced twice) saying: (And if he hath divorced her) i.e. the third time, (then she is not lawful unto him thereafter) after the third divorce (until she hath wedded another husband) and the marriage must be consummated. (Then if he (the other husband) divorce her) this was revealed about 'Abd al-Rahman Ibn al-Zubayr, (it is no sin for both of them) the first husband and the woman (that they come together again) with a new dowry and marriage contract (if they consider) if they know (that they are able to observe the limits of Allah) the rulings of Allah regulating the relationship between husband and wife. (These are the limits of Allah) these are Allah's rulings and obligations. (He manifesteth them for people who have knowledge) they are from Allah and believe them to be so."

(Retain them not to their hurt) in a way that causes their hurt (so that ye transgress (the limits)) that you transgress against them by prolonging their waiting period for them. (He who doeth that) he who so hurts his wife (hath wronged his own soul) has caused harm to himself. (Make not the revelations of Allah) His commands and prohibitions (a laughing stock (by your behaviour)) by not acting upon them, (but remember Allah's grace upon you) preserve Allah's blessing on you Who gave you Islam (and that which He hath revealed unto you of the Scripture) in the Scripture of commands and prohibitions (and of wisdom) the lawful and the unlawful, (whereby He doth exhort you) prohibits you from hurting them. (Observe your duty to Allah) fear Allah if you hurt them (and know that Allah is Aware of all things) harming others as well as other things."

(This) what is mentioned above (is an admonition) a command (for him among you who believeth in Allah and the Last Day. This) what is mentioned above (is more virtuous) better (for you, and cleaner) for your hearts and theirs from misgivings and enmity. (Allah knoweth) the love of the wife for her husband: (while ye know not) this. This verse was revealed about Ma'qil Ibn Yasar al-Muzani who prevented his sister Jamilah from returning to her first husband 'Abdullah Ibn 'Asim with a new dowry and marriage contract. Allah forbade him from doing so."
وَٱلْوَالِدَاتُ يُرْضِعْنَ أَوْلاَدَهُنَّ حَوْلَيْنِ كَامِلَيْنِ لِمَنْ أَرَادَ أَن يُتِمَّ ٱلرَّضَاعَةَ وَعلَى ٱلْمَوْلُودِ لَهُ رِزْقُهُنَّ وَكِسْوَتُهُنَّ بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ لاَ تُكَلَّفُ نَفْسٌ إِلاَّ وُسْعَهَا لاَ تُضَآرَّ وَالِدَةٌ بِوَلَدِهَا وَلاَ مَوْلُودٌ لَّهُ بِوَلَدِهِ وَعَلَى ٱلْوَارِثِ مِثْلُ ذٰلِكَ فَإِنْ أَرَادَا فِصَالاً عَن تَرَاضٍ مِّنْهُمَا وَتَشَاوُرٍ فَلاَ جُنَاحَ عَلَيْهِمَا وَإِنْ أَرَدتُّمْ أَن تَسْتَرْضِعُوۤاْ أَوْلاَدَكُمْ فَلاَ جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ إِذَا سَلَّمْتُم مَّآ آتَيْتُم بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ وَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَٱعْلَمُوۤاْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ,"(Mothers) who are divorced (shall suckle their children for two whole years; (that is) for those who wish to complete the suckling) of the child. (The duty of feeding) of suckling the child (and clothing nursing mothers in a seemly manner) without excess or stinginess (is upon the father of the child. No soul should be charged) for providing sustenance for suckling (beyond its capacity) except in proportion of what Allah has given it of wealth. (A mother should not be made to suffer because of her child) by taking her child from her after having accepted what was given to someone else for suckling her child, (nor should he whom the child is born) i.e. the father ((be made to suffer) because of his child) by handing him the child after the latter became familiar with his mother and would not take any other breast. (And on the (father's) heir) the heir of the father and it is also said the heir of the child (is incumbent the like of that (which was incumbent on the father)) in terms of providing sustenance and avoiding causing harm, in case this person is not the father. (If they) the mother and father (desire to wean the child by mutual consent) of the father and mother (and (after) consultation) between them, (it is no sin for them) i.e. the father and mother, if they do not suckle the child two full years; (and if ye wish to give your children out to nurse) by other than the mother and the latter wants to remarry, (it is no sin for you) for both the mother and father, (provided that ye pay what is due from you) provided that you spend what you have given (in kindness) in consent and without any disagreement. (And observe your duty to Allah) fear Allah regarding harming and disagreement, (and know that Allah is Seer of what ye do)."
وَٱلَّذِينَ يُتَوَفَّوْنَ مِنكُمْ وَيَذَرُونَ أَزْوَاجاً يَتَرَبَّصْنَ بِأَنْفُسِهِنَّ أَرْبَعَةَ أَشْهُرٍ وَعَشْراً فَإِذَا بَلَغْنَ أَجَلَهُنَّ فَلاَ جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ فِيمَا فَعَلْنَ فِيۤ أَنْفُسِهِنَّ بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ وَٱللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيرٌ,"(Such of you as die) among your men (and leave behind them wives, they (the wives) shall wait) a waiting period, (keeping themselves apart, four months and ten days. And when they reach the term (prescribed for them)) when they complete their waiting period (then there is no sin for you) for the relatives of the deceased (in aught that they may do with themselves) in terms of making themselves attractive (in decency) for the purpose of remarrying. (And Allah is Informed of what ye do) whether it is good or evil."
وَلاَ جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ فِيمَا عَرَّضْتُمْ بِهِ مِنْ خِطْبَةِ ٱلنِّسَآءِ أَوْ أَكْنَنتُمْ فِيۤ أَنْفُسِكُمْ عَلِمَ ٱللَّهُ أَنَّكُمْ سَتَذْكُرُونَهُنَّ وَلَـٰكِن لاَّ تُوَاعِدُوهُنَّ سِرّاً إِلاَّ أَن تَقُولُواْ قَوْلاً مَّعْرُوفاً وَلاَ تَعْزِمُوۤاْ عُقْدَةَ ٱلنِّكَاحِ حَتَّىٰ يَبْلُغَ ٱلْكِتَابُ أَجَلَهُ وَٱعْلَمُوۤاْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَعْلَمُ مَا فِيۤ أَنْفُسِكُمْ فَٱحْذَرُوهُ وَٱعْلَمُوۤاْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ حَلِيمٌ,"(There is no sin on you) there is no harm in talking (in that which ye proclaim or hide in your mind concerning your troth with women) concerning your offer to the woman whose husband is dead, before the waiting period ends, that you desire to marry her after the waiting period, such as saying to her: “If Allah unites us lawfully, I would like that”. (Allah knoweth that you will remember them) remember marrying them. (But plight not your troth with them) to have sexual intercourse with them (except by uttering a recognised form of words) properly and unequivocally by saying for example: “If Allah unites us lawfully, I would like that”, and no more. (And do not consummate the marriage until (the term) prescribed is run) until the waiting period comes to an end. (And know that Allah knoweth what is in your minds) in your hearts whether you are going to honour your pledge or not, (so beware of Him) beware of contravening Him; (and know that Allah is Forgiving) of those who repent of transgressing against Him, (Clement) since He does not hasten His punishment upon those who transgress against Him."
لاَّ جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ إِن طَلَّقْتُمُ ٱلنِّسَآءَ مَا لَمْ تَمَسُّوهُنَّ أَوْ تَفْرِضُواْ لَهُنَّ فَرِيضَةً وَمَتِّعُوهُنَّ عَلَى ٱلْمُوسِعِ قَدَرُهُ وَعَلَى ٱلْمُقْتِرِ قَدَرُهُ مَتَاعاً بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ حَقّاً عَلَى ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,"(There is no sin on you if ye divorce women while yet ye have not touched them) while you have not had sex with them, (nor appointed unto them a portion) or have not specified a dowry for them. (Provide for them) as divorce requires, (the rich according to his means, and the strained according to his means, a fair provision) this is in surplus of the price given to the prostitute for her services (mahr al-baghiy), the least amount of it consists of a chemise, a head covering and a wrap. ((This is) a bounden duty for those who do good) it is an obligation upon those who believe in the divine Oneness of Allah because it is a substitute for the dowry."
وَإِن طَلَّقْتُمُوهُنَّ مِن قَبْلِ أَن تَمَسُّوهُنَّ وَقَدْ فَرَضْتُمْ لَهُنَّ فَرِيضَةً فَنِصْفُ مَا فَرَضْتُمْ إِلاَّ أَن يَعْفُونَ أَوْ يَعْفُوَاْ ٱلَّذِي بِيَدِهِ عُقْدَةُ ٱلنِّكَاحِ وَأَن تَعْفُوۤاْ أَقْرَبُ لِلتَّقْوَىٰ وَلاَ تَنسَوُاْ ٱلْفَضْلَ بَيْنَكُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ,"Then Allah exposited on the legal ruling of she whose dowry had been specified, saying: (And if ye divorce them before ye have touched them) before you have had sexual intercourse with them (and ye have appointed unto them a portion) you have specified a dowry for them, (then (pay the) half of that which ye appointed) half of the dowry you specified, (unless they (the women) agree to forgo it) unless the woman forgoes her right and leaves it to the husband, (or he agreeth to forgo it in whose is the marriage tie), or the husband forgoes his right and gives the woman her full dowry. (To forgo) your rights (is nearer to piety) is nearer to piety for the God-fearing. Allah says here to the husband and wife: it is more conducive to God-fearing if you forgo your right to the other; (And forget not kindness among yourselves) Allah says to both: continue to be kind and generous to each other. (Indeed Allah is Seer of what ye do) of acts of kindness and generosity."
حَافِظُواْ عَلَى ٱلصَّلَوَٰتِ وٱلصَّلَٰوةِ ٱلْوُسْطَىٰ وَقُومُواْ للَّهِ قَٰنِتِينَ,"Allah then prompted the believers to observe the five daily prayers, saying: (Be guardians of your prayers) the five daily prayers including the ritual ablution that precede them, their bowings, prostrations, and everything prescribed in them during their appointed times, (and of the midmost prayer) the 'Asr prayer specifically, (and stand up with devotion to Allah) pray to Allah, by performing the bowings and prostrations this prayer includes; it is also said that this means: pray to Him by being obedient to Him in the prayer and not disobedient through engagement in mundane talk."
فَإنْ خِفْتُمْ فَرِجَالاً أَوْ رُكْبَاناً فَإِذَآ أَمِنتُمْ فَٱذْكُرُواْ ٱللَّهَ كَمَا عَلَّمَكُم مَّا لَمْ تَكُونُواْ تَعْلَمُونَ,"(And if ye go in fear) of the enemy's sword, (then (pray) standing or on horseback) in whatever direction. (And when ye are again in safety) from the enemy, (remember Allah) pray to Allah performing the bowings and prostrations, (as He hath taught you) in the Qur'an: the traveller prays two units of prayer while the resident prays four units (that which ye knew not) before the revelation of the Qur'an."
وَٱلَّذِينَ يُتَوَفَّوْنَ مِنكُمْ وَيَذَرُونَ أَزْوَاجاً وَصِيَّةً لأَزْوَاجِهِمْ مَّتَاعاً إِلَى ٱلْحَوْلِ غَيْرَ إِخْرَاجٍ فَإِنْ خَرَجْنَ فَلاَ جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ فِي مَا فَعَلْنَ فِيۤ أَنْفُسِهِنَّ مِن مَّعْرُوفٍ وَٱللَّهُ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ,"((In the case of) those who are about to die and leave behind them wives, they should bequeath unto their wives a provision) regarding their wealth (for the year) sustenance and habitation for a year (without turning them out) of the houses of their husbands, (but if they go out) of their own accord, or if they marry before the lapse of a year (there is no sin on you) on the inheritors of the deceased to stop providing sustenance and habitation after she leaves the house of her husband or remarries (in that which they do of themselves) nor is there any blame on them in what the wives do to themselves (within their rights) looking forward to remarriage, making themselves beautiful for this purpose. This, i.e. the sustenance due on the deceased towards any wife he leaves behind, was however abrogated by her inheritance. (Allah is Mighty) for He is vengeful towards any that leaves what He has commanded, (Wise) in that He abrogated apportioning a year of sustenance and habitation to the wife whose husband is deceased and substituted it with what is due to her of inheritance: a quarter or eighth of the deceased's wealth."
وَلِلْمُطَلَّقَاتِ مَتَاعٌ بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ حَقّاً عَلَى ٱلْمُتَّقِينَ,"(For divorced women a provision in kindness) with generosity and kindness: (a duty for those who ward off (evil)). It is an obligation because it is in surplus to the dowry, and it is done out of generosity."
كَذَلِكَ يُبَيِّنُ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمْ آيَاتِهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ,(Thus Allah expoundeth unto you His revelations) His commands and prohibitions (so that ye may understand) what you have been commanded to do.
أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى ٱلَّذِينَ خَرَجُواْ مِن دِيَٰرِهِمْ وَهُمْ أُلُوفٌ حَذَرَ ٱلْمَوْتِ فَقَالَ لَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ مُوتُواْ ثُمَّ أَحْيَٰهُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَذُو فَضْلٍ عَلَى ٱلنَّاسِ وَلَـٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ ٱلنَّاسِ لاَ يَشْكُرُونَ,"Then Allah mentioned the story of the fighters among the Children of Israel, saying: (Bethink thee (O Muhammad)) have you not been informed, O Muhammad, (of those of old, who went forth from their habitations) to fight their enemies (in their thousands) eight thousand in total, but they proved too cowardly to fight, (fearing death) out of fear of being killed, (and Allah said unto them: Die) Allah killed them on the spot, (and then He brought them back to life) after eight days. (Lo! Allah is the Lord of Kindness to mankind) to these people for He brought them back to life, (but most of mankind give not thanks) for life."
وَقَٰتِلُواْ فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ وَٱعْلَمُوۤاْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ,"Allah then said to them after He brought them back to life: (And fight in the way of Allah) in obedience of Allah against your enemies, (and know that Allah is Hearer) of what you say, (Knower) of your intentions and the punishment that is going to visit you if you disobey what you have been commanded to do."
مَّن ذَا ٱلَّذِي يُقْرِضُ ٱللَّهَ قَرْضاً حَسَناً فَيُضَٰعِفَهُ لَهُ أَضْعَافاً كَثِيرَةً وَٱللَّهُ يَقْبِضُ وَيَبْسُطُ وَإِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ,"Allah then prompted the believer to give in charity, saying: (Who is it that will lend unto Allah a goodly loan) in charity sincerely wanting nothing but the sake of Allah, (so that He may give it increase manifold for him?) every act is rewarded a thousand times (Allah straiteneth) withholds wealth from people (and enlargeth) gives plenty to whomever He wills in this worldly life. (Unto Him ye will return) after you die and He will requite each according to his works. This verse was revealed about a man from the Helpers (al-Ansar) named Abu'l-Dahdah or Abu'l-Dahdahah."
أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى ٱلْمَلإِ مِن بَنِيۤ إِسْرَائِيلَ مِن بَعْدِ مُوسَىۤ إِذْ قَالُواْ لِنَبِيٍّ لَّهُمُ ٱبْعَثْ لَنَا مَلِكاً نُّقَاتِلْ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ قَالَ هَلْ عَسَيْتُمْ إِن كُتِبَ عَلَيْكُمُ ٱلْقِتَالُ أَلاَّ تُقَاتِلُواْ قَالُواْ وَمَا لَنَآ أَلاَّ نُقَاتِلَ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ وَقَدْ أُخْرِجْنَا مِن دِيَارِنَا وَأَبْنَآئِنَا فَلَمَّا كُتِبَ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلْقِتَالُ تَوَلَّوْاْ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً مِّنْهُمْ وَٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ بِٱلظَّالِمِينَ,"(Bethink thee) have you not been told (of the leaders of the Children of Israel after Moses, how they said unto a prophet whom they had) the prophet is Samuel (Shamwil): (Set up for us a king) show to us the king of this army (and we will fight) under his command against our enemy (in Allah's way) in Allah's obedience. (He said: Would ye then) do you suppose then that you will (refrain from fighting if fighting) against your enemy (were prescribed for you?) made obligatory upon you. (They said: why should we not fight in Allah's way when we have been expelled from our dwellings) from our homes (and separated from our children) who were taken as slaves? (Yet, when fighting was prescribed for them) was made obligatory upon them, (they turned away) they refrained from fighting their enemy, (all save a few of them) 313 men. (And Allah is Aware of evil-doers) who shy away from fighting their enemy."

Allah hath raised up) identified (Saul to be king for you. They said: How can) it be justified that (he have kingdom over us) for he is not of royal descent (when we are more deserving of the kingdom than he is) for we are of royal descent, (since he hath not been given wealth enough) to spend on the army? (He) Samuel (said: Lo! Allah hath chosen him) to be king and sovereign (above you, and hath increased him abundantly in wisdom) the knowledge of warfare (and stature) size and physical strength. (Allah bestoweth His sovereignty on whom he will) in this life even if he is not of royal descent. (Allah is All-Embracing) in His gift, (All-Knowing) about whom He gives to, because they said to their prophet that it was he who chose Saul rather than his being appointed by Allah."

The token) the sign (of his kingdom) that it is from Allah (is that there shall come unto you the Ark) that was taken from you (wherein is peace of reassurance) mercy and tranquillity; it is also said that this means: it includes the wind (the triumph) of his victory, of golden colour in the form of a human face (from your Lord, and a remnant of that which the house of Moses) a remnant of Moses, i.e. his Scripture; as it is said: his tablets and staff (and the house of Aaron left behind) what Aaron had left behind, namely his cloak and turban, (the angels bearing it) the angels leading it. (Lo! Herein) in giving you back the Ark (shall be a token) a sign (for you) that he has been made king by Allah (if (in truth) ye are believers)."
فَلَمَّا فَصَلَ طَالُوتُ بِٱلْجُنُودِ قَالَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ مُبْتَلِيكُمْ بِنَهَرٍ فَمَن شَرِبَ مِنْهُ فَلَيْسَ مِنِّي وَمَن لَّمْ يَطْعَمْهُ فَإِنَّهُ مِنِّيۤ إِلاَّ مَنِ ٱغْتَرَفَ غُرْفَةً بِيَدِهِ فَشَرِبُواْ مِنْهُ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً مِّنْهُمْ فَلَمَّا جَاوَزَهُ هُوَ وَٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ مَعَهُ قَالُواْ لاَ طَاقَةَ لَنَا ٱلْيَوْمَ بِجَالُوتَ وَجُنودِهِ قَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ يَظُنُّونَ أَنَّهُمْ مُلاَقُواْ ٱللَّهِ كَم مِّن فِئَةٍ قَلِيلَةٍ غَلَبَتْ فِئَةً كَثِيرَةً بِإِذْنِ ٱللَّهِ وَٱللَّهُ مَعَ ٱلصَّابِرِينَ,"When they were given the Ark back, they accepted him as their king and went out with him to fight. (And when Saul set out) went forth (with the army) through a wasteland and became very thirsty, they asked him to provide them with water, (he) i.e. Saul (said: Lo! Allah will try you by a river) Allah will test you by a flowing river. (Whosoever therefore drinketh thereof) from the river (he is not of me) he is not going to be with me in the fight against my enemy and will not go further, (and whoever tasteth it not he is of me) against my enemy, but then he made an exception, (save him who taketh (thereof) in the hollow of his hand) and this was enough for them, their beasts and transportation. (But they drank thereof) when they reached the river however they drank as much as they wanted to, (all save a few of them) 313 men who did not drink except as they had been directed. (And after he had crossed) the river, (he) i.e. Saul (and those who believed with him, they said) to each other: (We have no power this day against Goliath and his hosts. But those who knew) and were convinced (that they would meet Allah) in person after they died (exclaimed: How many a little company) of believers (hath overcome a mighty host) of unbelievers (by Allah's leave!) by the help of Allah. (And Allah is with the steadfast) He assists the steadfast in war by giving them victory."
وَلَمَّا بَرَزُواْ لِجَالُوتَ وَجُنُودِهِ قَالُواْ رَبَّنَآ أَفْرِغْ عَلَيْنَا صَبْراً وَثَبِّتْ أَقْدَامَنَا وَٱنْصُرْنَا عَلَى ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلْكَافِرِينَ,"(And when they went into the field against Goliath and his hosts they) those who believed (said: Our Lord!

(And if Allah had not repelled some men by others) as He repelled through David the evil of Goliath from the Children of Israel (the earth would have been corrupted). He says: Allah repelled from the believers, by means of the prophets, the evil of their enemies, and He repelled from those who refrained from participating in the fight for Allah's sake, by means of those who fought in His sake, the evil of their enemies. If it were not thus, the earth would have been corrupted. (But Allah is a Lord of Kindness to all the worlds) by this repelling."

(And if Allah had so willed it, those who followed after them) after Moses and Jesus (would not have fought one with another) differed with one another (after clear proofs had come unto them) the exposition in their Scriptures of the description and traits of Muhammad. (But they differed) in the matter of Religion, (some of them believing) in every Scripture and Messenger (and some disbelieving) in the Scriptures and messengers. (And if Allah had so willed it, they would not have fought one with another) they would not have differed with one another in the matter of the religion; (but Allah doeth what He will) with His servants."

(He knoweth that which is in front of them) in front of the angels regarding the matter of the Hereafter and who is to intercede (and that which is behind them) of the life of this world, (while they encompass nothing of His knowledge save that He will). Allah says: the angels know nothing of the Hereafter or of the life of this world save that which Allah has taught them. (His throne includeth the heaven and the earth) He says that His Chair extends far beyond the heavens and the earth, (and He is never weary of preserving them) it is not burdensome for Him to preserve the Throne and Chair without the angels. (He is the Sublime) more sublime than anything, (the Tremendous) more tremendous than anything."
لاَ إِكْرَاهَ فِي ٱلدِّينِ قَد تَّبَيَّنَ ٱلرُّشْدُ مِنَ ٱلْغَيِّ فَمَنْ يَكْفُرْ بِٱلطَّاغُوتِ وَيْؤْمِن بِٱللَّهِ فَقَدِ ٱسْتَمْسَكَ بِٱلْعُرْوَةِ ٱلْوُثْقَىٰ لاَ ٱنفِصَامَ لَهَا وَٱللَّهُ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ,"(There is no compulsion in religion) no one from among the people of the Book and the Magians should be coerced to believe in the divine Oneness of Allah after the Arabs' embrace of Islam. (The right direction is henceforth distinct from error) faith from disbelief and Truth from falsehood. The following was revealed about Mundhir Ibn Sawi al-Tamimi: (And he who rejecteth false deities) the command of the devil and the worship of idols (and believeth in Allah) and in what has come forth from Him (hath grasped a firm handhold) has taken in trust “there is no God save Allah” (which will never break) will never cease, vanish or perish; it is also said that this means: for him who believes in it, the bliss of Paradise will never cease and he will never be taken out of Paradise, nor will he perish by staying in the Fire. (Allah is Hearer) of this speech, (Knower) of its reward and bliss."
ٱللَّهُ وَلِيُّ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ يُخْرِجُهُمْ مِّنَ ٱلظُّلُمَاتِ إِلَى ٱلنُّورِ وَٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوۤاْ أَوْلِيَآؤُهُمُ ٱلطَّاغُوتُ يُخْرِجُونَهُمْ مِّنَ ٱلنُّورِ إِلَى ٱلظُّلُمَاتِ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ أَصْحَابُ ٱلنَّارِ هُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ,"(Allah is the Protecting Friend of those who believe) He protects and gives victory to the believers, referring here to 'Abdullah Ibn Salam and his companions. (He bringeth them out of darkness into light) He gave them success and brought them out of disbelief into faith. (As for those who disbelieve) i.e. Ka'b Ibn al-Ashraf and his companions, (their patrons are false deities) the devil. (They bring them out of light into darkness) they invite them from faith to disbelief. (Such are rightful owners of the Fire) the dwellers of hell. (They will abide therein forever) never to die or leave it."
أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى ٱلَّذِي حَآجَّ إِبْرَاهِيمَ فِي رَبِّهِ أَنْ آتَاهُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْمُلْكَ إِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ رَبِّيَ ٱلَّذِي يُحْيِـي وَيُمِيتُ قَالَ أَنَا أُحْيِـي وَأُمِيتُ قَالَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَأْتِي بِٱلشَّمْسِ مِنَ ٱلْمَشْرِقِ فَأْتِ بِهَا مِنَ ٱلْمَغْرِبِ فَبُهِتَ ٱلَّذِي كَفَرَ وَٱللَّهُ لاَ يَهْدِي ٱلْقَوْمَ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ,"(Bethink thee) have you not been informed (of him who had an argument with Abraham about his Lord) about the Religion of his Lord, (because Allah had given him the kingdom) he is Nimrod Ibn Canaan; (how, when Abraham said: My Lord is He Who giveth life and causeth death) gives life upon the resurrection and causes death by ending the life of this world, (he answered: I give life and cause death. Abraham said) give me proof of what you say. So Nimrod brought two prisoners, killed one and spared the other and then said: this is my proof. When he saw this, Abraham said: (Lo! Allah causeth the sun to rise in the East) from the direction of the East, (so do thou cause it to come up from the West) from the direction of the West. (Thus was the disbeliever abashed) the one who disbelieved kept quiet and could not argue. (And Allah guideth not) to the right argument (wrong-doing folk) the unbelievers, referring here to Nimrod."
أَوْ كَٱلَّذِي مَرَّ عَلَىٰ قَرْيَةٍ وَهِيَ خَاوِيَةٌ عَلَىٰ عُرُوشِهَا قَالَ أَنَّىٰ يُحْيِـي هَـٰذِهِ ٱللَّهُ بَعْدَ مَوْتِهَا فَأَمَاتَهُ ٱللَّهُ مِئَةَ عَامٍ ثُمَّ بَعَثَهُ قَالَ كَمْ لَبِثْتَ قَالَ لَبِثْتُ يَوْماً أَوْ بَعْضَ يَوْمٍ قَالَ بَل لَّبِثْتَ مِئَةَ عَامٍ فَٱنْظُرْ إِلَىٰ طَعَامِكَ وَشَرَابِكَ لَمْ يَتَسَنَّهْ وَٱنْظُرْ إِلَىٰ حِمَارِكَ وَلِنَجْعَلَكَ آيَةً لِلنَّاسِ وَٱنْظُرْ إِلَى ٱلعِظَامِ كَيْفَ نُنْشِزُهَا ثُمَّ نَكْسُوهَا لَحْماً فَلَمَّا تَبَيَّنَ لَهُ قَالَ أَعْلَمُ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,"(Or (bethink thee) the like of him who, passing by a township) He says: do you not know about 'Uzayr Ibn Shurahya who passed by the township of Dayr Hiraql (which had fallen into utter ruin, exclaimed: How shall Allah give this township life after its death) How can Allah bring the people of this township back to life after their death? (So Allah made him die) right on the spot (a hundred years, then brought him back to life) at the end of the day. (He) Allah (said: How long hast thou tarried) O 'Uzayr? (He said: I have tarried for a day) and then looked at the sun still in the horizon and said (or part of a day. He) Allah (said: Nay, but thou hast tarried) you were dead (for a hundred years. Just look at thy food) figs and grapes (and drink) juice (which have not rotted! Look at thine ass!) look at the bones of your ass how white they look! (And, that We may make thee a token) a sign (to mankind) regarding the matter of bringing the dead to life, that they will be resurrected in the same state they died in, because 'Uzayr died young and was brought back to life as a young person. It is said that Allah made him a lesson for people, for he died when he was 40 years old and was brought back to life when his son was 120 years old, (look at the bones) the bones of your ass, (how We adjust them and then cover them with flesh!) after this. He then said: We will make grow on it nerves and veins, flesh, skin and hair and put the spirit in it. (And when (the matter) became clear unto him) how Allah gathers the bones, (he said: I know) I had known (that Allah is Able to do all things) of life and death."
وَإِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ رَبِّ أَرِنِي كَيْفَ تُحْيِـي ٱلْمَوْتَىٰ قَالَ أَوَلَمْ تُؤْمِن قَالَ بَلَىٰ وَلَـكِن لِّيَطْمَئِنَّ قَلْبِي قَالَ فَخُذْ أَرْبَعَةً مِّنَ ٱلطَّيْرِ فَصُرْهُنَّ إِلَيْكَ ثُمَّ ٱجْعَلْ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ جَبَلٍ مِّنْهُنَّ جُزْءًا ثُمَّ ٱدْعُهُنَّ يَأْتِينَكَ سَعْياً وَٱعْلَمْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ,"(And when Abraham) also (said: My Lord! Show me how Thou givest life to the dead) how you gather the bones of the dead again, (He said: Dost thou not believe?) are you not convinced? (Abraham said: Yea) I am convinced, (but (I ask) in order that my heart may be at ease) in order that the heat of my heart abates and so that I know that I am your friend and that my prayers are answered. ((His Lord) said: Take four of the birds) of different kinds: a cockerel, a raven, a duck and a peacock (and cause them to incline unto you) cut them into pieces, (then place a part of them on each hill) four different hills, (then call them) by their names, (they will come to thee) walking (in haste). (And know) O Abraham! (that Allah is Mighty) for He is vengeful against those who do not believe in bringing the dead back to life, (Wise) He gathers the bones of the dead and bring them back to life, just as He gathered these birds and brought them back to life."
مَّثَلُ ٱلَّذِينَ يُنْفِقُونَ أَمْوَالَهُمْ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ كَمَثَلِ حَبَّةٍ أَنبَتَتْ سَبْعَ سَنَابِلَ فِي كُلِّ سُنبُلَةٍ مِّئَةُ حَبَّةٍ وَٱللَّهُ يُضَاعِفُ لِمَن يَشَآءُ وَٱللَّهُ وَاسِعٌ عَلِيمٌ,"Then Allah mentioned the spending of the believers in the way of Allah, saying: (The likeness of those who spend their wealth in Allah's way) He says: the likeness of the wealth of those who spend in His way (is as the likeness of a grain which groweths seven ears, in every ear a hundred grains) likewise, Allah multiplies what the believers spend in His way from one to seven hundred fold. (Allah giveth increase manifold) in surplus of this (to whom He will) to whomever deserves it; it is also said: to whomever Allah accepts his spending. (Allah is All-Embracing) by multiplying his reward manifold, (All-Knowing) of what the believers spend and of their intentions."
ٱلَّذِينَ يُنْفِقُونَ أَمْوَالَهُمْ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ ثُمَّ لاَ يُتْبِعُونَ مَآ أَنْفَقُواُ مَنّاً وَلاَ أَذًى لَّهُمْ أَجْرُهُمْ عِنْدَ رَبِّهِمْ وَلاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلاَ هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ,"(Those who spend their wealth for the cause of Allah) this was revealed about 'Uthman Ibn 'Affan and 'Abd al-Rahman Ibn 'Awf, (and afterward make not reproach) to Allah (and injury) upon whom they spend it on (to follow that which they have spent) after their spending; (their reward is with their Lord) in Paradise, (and there shall no fear come upon them) regarding any future torment, (neither shall they grieve) about what they have left behind."
قَوْلٌ مَّعْرُوفٌ وَمَغْفِرَةٌ خَيْرٌ مِّن صَدَقَةٍ يَتْبَعُهَآ أَذًى وَٱللَّهُ غَنِيٌّ حَلِيمٌ,"(A kind word) a good word for your brother, in his absence, by praying for him and praising him in front of other people, (with forgiveness) that overlooks any misdeed (is better) for him and you (than almsgiving followed by injury) than reminding him about your favour upon him which will hurt him. (Allah is Absolute) in His freedom from the need of such a person's charity, (Clement) for He does not hasten the punishment of this person."
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ لاَ تُبْطِلُواْ صَدَقَٰتِكُم بِٱلْمَنِّ وَٱلأَذَىٰ كَٱلَّذِي يُنْفِقُ مَالَهُ رِئَآءَ ٱلنَّاسِ وَلاَ يُؤْمِنُ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلآخِرِ فَمَثَلُهُ كَمَثَلِ صَفْوَانٍ عَلَيْهِ تُرَابٌ فَأَصَابَهُ وَابِلٌ فَتَرَكَهُ صَلْداً لاَّ يَقْدِرُونَ عَلَىٰ شَيْءٍ مِّمَّا كَسَبُواْ وَٱللَّهُ لاَ يَهْدِي ٱلْقَوْمَ ٱلْكَافِرِينَ,"(O ye who believe! Render not vain your almsgiving) the reward of your almsgiving (by reproach) to Allah, i.e. by being conceited (and injury) to the person receiving alms, (like him who spendeth his wealth only to be seen of men) out of ostentation (and believeth not in Allah and the Last Day) does not believe in resurrection after death. (His likeness) the likeness of the person who reminds others about what he has given them and the alms given by one who associates partners with Allah (is as the likeness of rock whereon is dust of earth; a rainstorm smiteth it, leaving it smooth and bare) without any dust on it. (They have no control of aught) to obtain a reward for anything in the Hereafter (of that which they have gained) that which they have spent in the life of this world. Allah says here: the reward of the person who boasts about what he has spent on alms and of the person who hurts those he gives alms to, is like dust on a rock when rain pours down on it and no dust remains. (Allah guideth not) rewards not (the disbelieving folk) and also those who show off their spending while still associating partners with Allah, just as He does not reward the alms of those who remind others about what they have spent on them."
وَمَثَلُ ٱلَّذِينَ يُنْفِقُونَ أَمْوٰلَهُمُ ٱبْتِغَآءَ مَرْضَاتِ ٱللَّهِ وَتَثْبِيتاً مِّنْ أَنْفُسِهِمْ كَمَثَلِ جَنَّةٍ بِرَبْوَةٍ أَصَابَهَا وَابِلٌ فَآتَتْ أُكُلَهَا ضِعْفَيْنِ فَإِن لَّمْ يُصِبْهَا وَابِلٌ فَطَلٌّ وَٱللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ,"(And the likeness of those who spend their wealth) the likeness of the wealth of those who spend it (in search of Allah's pleasure) seeking Allah's pleasure, (and for the strengthening of their souls) truly, out of conviction and certitude in their hearts that they will be rewarded, (is as the likeness of a garden on a height) on an elevated plain. (The rainstorm smiteth it and it bringeth forth its fruit twofold. And if the rainstorm smite it not, then the shower) this is like the spending of the believer, whether small or great, when it is done with sincerity and fearingness, Allah multiplies it as He multiplies the fruits of a garden. (Allah is Seer of what ye do) of what you spend."
أَيَوَدُّ أَحَدُكُمْ أَن تَكُونَ لَهُ جَنَّةٌ مِّن نَّخِيلٍ وَأَعْنَابٍ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلأَنْهَارُ لَهُ فِيهَا مِن كُلِّ ٱلثَّمَرَاتِ وَأَصَابَهُ ٱلْكِبَرُ وَلَهُ ذُرِّيَّةٌ ضُعَفَآءُ فَأَصَابَهَآ إِعْصَارٌ فِيهِ نَارٌ فَٱحْتَرَقَتْ كَذَلِكَ يُبَيِّنُ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمُ ٱلأيَٰتِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَفَكَّرُونَ,"(Would any of you like) wish (to have a garden of palm-trees and vines, with rivers flowing beneath it) under its trees, houses and rooms, (with all kinds of fruit for him therein) in the garden; (and old age hath stricken him and he hath feeble offspring) who cannot fend for themselves; (and a fiery whirlwind) a strong cold or hot wind (striketh it) i.e. the garden (and it is (all) consumed by fire. Thus Allah maketh plain His revelations) His signs through commands and prohibitions (unto you, in order that you may give thought) so that you may reflect on the similes of the Qur'an. This is also like the unbelievers in the Hereafter, they shall have no power neither will they be able to come back to the life of this world just as a person advanced in age is without strength and cannot revert to his former vigour and youth."
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُوۤاْ أَنْفِقُواْ مِن طَيِّبَاتِ مَا كَسَبْتُمْ وَمِمَّآ أَخْرَجْنَا لَكُم مِّنَ ٱلأَرْضِ وَلاَ تَيَمَّمُواْ ٱلْخَبِيثَ مِنْهُ تُنْفِقُونَ وَلَسْتُمْ بِآخِذِيهِ إِلاَّ أَن تُغْمِضُواْ فِيهِ وَٱعْلَمُوۤاْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَنِيٌّ حَمِيدٌ,"(O ye who believe! spend of the good) of the lawful (things which ye have earned) which you have amassed of gold and silver, (and of that which we bring forth from the earth for you) of what is grown in the earth, i.e. grains and fruits, (and seek not the bad (with intent)) do not single out what is base among your wealth (to spend thereof (in charity) when ye would not take) accept (it for yourselves save with disdain) and after forgoing some of your rights; likewise Allah does not accept what is base from you; (and know that Allah is Absolute) and free from the need of your spending, (Owner of Praise) He is praised in His acts; as it is said that this means: He is grateful for small spending and rewards abundantly for spending in abundance. This verse was revealed about a man in Medina who was the owner of a type of dates called Hashaf."
ٱلشَّيْطَانُ يَعِدُكُمُ ٱلْفَقْرَ وَيَأْمُرُكُم بِٱلْفَحْشَآءِ وَٱللَّهُ يَعِدُكُم مَّغْفِرَةً مِّنْهُ وَفَضْلاً وَٱللَّهُ وَاسِعٌ عَلِيمٌ,"(The devil promiseth you destitution) makes you scared of poverty upon spending in charity (and enjoineth on you lewdness) by not giving the poor-due. (But Allah promiseth you forgiveness) of your sins for giving the poor-due (from Himself with bounty) with something in exchange as well as a reward in the Hereafter. (Allah is All-Embracing) in that He replaces what you spend and also forgives sins, (All-Knowing) of your intentions and spending."
يُؤْتِي الْحِكْمَةَ مَن يَشَآءُ وَمَن يُؤْتَ الْحِكْمَةَ فَقَدْ أُوتِيَ خَيْراً كَثِيراً وَمَا يَذَّكَّرُ إِلاَّ أُوْلُواْ ٱلأَلْبَابِ,"Then Allah mentioned His favour, saying: (He giveth wisdom unto whom He will) i.e. prophethood to Muhammad (pbuh); it is also said that wisdom here means the interpretation of the Qur'an; as it is said that it refers to being in the right in speech, action and opinion, (and he unto him wisdom) being in the right in speech, action and opinion (is given, he truly hath received abundant good. But none remember) takes admonitions from the similes of the Qur'an or wisdom (except men of understanding) those who have minds from among people."
وَمَآ أَنفَقْتُمْ مِّن نَّفَقَةٍ أَوْ نَذَرْتُمْ مِّن نَّذْرٍ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَعْلَمُهُ وَمَا لِلظَّالِمِينَ مِنْ أَنْصَارٍ,"(Whatever alms ye spend) for the sake of Allah (or vow ye vow) in obedience of Allah which you honour, (Lo! Allah knoweth it). Allah accepts it if it is solely for His Countenance as He also rewards for it. (Wrong-doers) those who ascribe partners to Allah (have no helpers) who can save them from Allah's torment."
إِن تُبْدُواْ ٱلصَّدَقَاتِ فَنِعِمَّا هِيَ وَإِن تُخْفُوهَا وَتُؤْتُوهَا ٱلْفُقَرَآءَ فَهُوَ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ وَيُكَفِّرُ عَنكُم مِّن سَيِّئَاتِكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيرٌ,"Allah then mentions almsgiving that is done in the open and that which is done secretly because they asked about it, saying: (If ye publish) if you show (your almsgiving) which is obligated upon you, (it is well, but if ye hide it) the supererogatory almsgiving (and give it to the poor) the folk of the Platform (ashab al-Suffah), (it will be better for you) than giving it in the open, but both are accepted from you, (and will atone for some of your ill deeds) in proportion of your almsgiving. (Allah is Informed of what ye do). He knows of the alms that you give."
لَّيْسَ عَلَيْكَ هُدَاهُمْ وَلَـٰكِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَهْدِي مَن يَشَآءُ وَمَا تُنْفِقُواْ مِنْ خَيْرٍ فَلأَنْفُسِكُمْ وَمَا تُنْفِقُونَ إِلاَّ ٱبْتِغَآءَ وَجْهِ ٱللَّهِ وَمَا تُنْفِقُواْ مِنْ خَيْرٍ يُوَفَّ إِلَيْكُمْ وَأَنْتُمْ لاَ تُظْلَمُونَ,"Then Allah gave dispensation to give alms to the poor among the idolaters and the people of the Book. Asma' the daughter of Abu Bakr, or Asma' the daughter of Abu'l-Nadir asked the Prophet: O Messenger of Allah! Is it permissible to give alms to our relatives who do not follow our Religion? Allah answered His Prophet by saying: (The guiding of them is not thy duty (O Muhammad)) it is not your duty to guide to Religion the poor from among the people of the Book, (but Allah guideth whomever He will) to His religion. (And whatsoever good thing) wealth (ye spend) on the poor, (it is for yourselves) its reward is for yourselves, (when ye spend) on the poor do (not) do so (save in search of Allah's Countenance) except in seeking Allah's pleasure; (and whatsoever good thing) wealth (ye spend) on the poor among the folk of the Platform, (it will be repaid to you in full) the reward of it will be saved for you in the Hereafter, (and ye will not be wronged) your reward shall not be diminished and your sins will not be increased."
لِلْفُقَرَآءِ ٱلَّذِينَ أُحصِرُواْ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ لاَ يَسْتَطِيعُونَ ضَرْباً فِي ٱلأَرْضِ يَحْسَبُهُمُ ٱلْجَاهِلُ أَغْنِيَآءَ مِنَ ٱلتَّعَفُّفِ تَعْرِفُهُم بِسِيمَاهُمْ لاَ يَسْأَلُونَ ٱلنَّاسَ إِلْحَافاً وَمَا تُنفِقُواْ مِنْ خَيْرٍ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ بِهِ عَلِيمٌ,"((Alms are) for the poor who are straitened) He says: alms are for those who confine themselves (for the cause of Allah) for the obedience of Allah in the Prophet's Mosque, i.e. the people of the Ledge, (who cannot travel in the land) for trade. (The unthinking man) the person who does not know them (accounteth them wealthy due to their restraint) because of their attire. (Thou shalt know them) O Muhammad! (by their mark) by their clothing: (They do not beg of men with importunity) He says: they neither beg with importunity nor without it. (And whatsoever good thing) wealth (ye spend) on the poor among the people of the Ledge, (lo! Allah knoweth it) Allah knows your wealth as well as your intentions."
ٱلَّذِينَ يُنْفِقُونَ أَمْوَالَهُمْ بِٱللَّيْلِ وَٱلنَّهَارِ سِرّاً وَعَلاَنِيَةً فَلَهُمْ أَجْرُهُمْ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ وَلاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلاَ هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ,"(Those who spend their wealth) in charity (by night and day, in secret and openly, surely their reward is with their Lord) in Paradise, (and there shall no fear come upon them) perpetually (neither shall they grieve) when others do. This verse was revealed about 'Ali Ibn Abi Talib."
ٱلَّذِينَ يَأْكُلُونَ ٱلرِّبَٰواْ لاَ يَقُومُونَ إِلاَّ كَمَا يَقُومُ ٱلَّذِي يَتَخَبَّطُهُ ٱلشَّيْطَانُ مِنَ ٱلْمَسِّ ذَلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ قَالُوۤاْ إِنَّمَا ٱلْبَيْعُ مِثْلُ ٱلرِّبَٰواْ وَأَحَلَّ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْبَيْعَ وَحَرَّمَ ٱلرِّبَٰواْ فَمَن جَآءَهُ مَوْعِظَةٌ مِّنْ رَّبِّهِ فَٱنْتَهَىٰ فَلَهُ مَا سَلَفَ وَأَمْرُهُ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ وَمَنْ عَادَ فَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ أَصْحَابُ ٱلنَّارِ هُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ,"Allah then mentioned the punishment of consuming usury, saying: (Those who swallow usury) declaring it to be lawful (cannot rise up) from their graves on the Day of Judgement (save as he ariseth) in the life of this world (whom the Devil hath prostrated) confounded (by (his) touch) of insanity. (That) confusion is, in the Hereafter, the sign of the one who consumes usury (is because they say: Trade is just like usury) increase at the end of selling, once the term is due, is like the increase at the beginning of a transaction when the sale is deferred; (whereas Allah permitteth trading) the former increase (and forbideth usury) the latter increase. (He unto whom and admonition from his Lord cometh) a prohibition of usury comes from his Lord, (and (he) refraineth (in obedience thereto)) from dealing in usury, (he shall keep (the profit) that which is past) he shall not be blamed for his dealing in usury before it was made unlawful, (and his affair (henceforth)) in what remains of his life (is with Allah) if He wishes He will protect him and if He wishes He will let him down. (As for him who returneth (to usury)) after usury has been made forbidden and says trade is just like usury (-such are rightful owners of the Fire) the dwellers of hell. (They will abide therein) they will abide therein until Allah wills."
يَمْحَقُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلرِّبَٰواْ وَيُرْبِي ٱلصَّدَقَٰتِ وَٱللَّهُ لاَ يُحِبُّ كُلَّ كَفَّارٍ أَثِيمٍ,"If they are sincere (Allah hath blighted usury) He has wiped it out and removed its blessedness in the life of this world and in the Hereafter (and made) the obligatory and supererogatory (almsgiving fruitful) accepted and rewarded many times over, when they are done sincerely for His sake. (Allah loveth not the impious) disbeliever who denies the unlawfulness of usury (and guilty) the impudent who consumes it."

Those who believe) in Allah, His messengers, scriptures as well as in the unlawfulness of usury (and do good works) regarding what is between them and their Lord and avoid usury (and establish worship) complete the five daily prayers with all that which is obligated in them (and pay the poor-due) and give the poor-due of their wealth, (their reward is with their Lord) in Paradise (and there shall no fear come upon them) when death is slain (neither shall they grieve) when the Fire is closed."
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ ٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَذَرُواْ مَا بَقِيَ مِنَ ٱلرِّبَٰواْ إِن كُنْتُمْ مُّؤْمِنِينَ,"(O ye who believe!) the reference here is to the sons of 'Amr Ibn 'Umayr Ibn 'Awf al-Thaqafi, [and they were four brothers:] Mas'ud [Ibn 'Amr], Hubayb [Ibn 'Amr], 'Abd Yalayl [Ibn 'Amr] and Rabi'ah [Ibn 'Amr] (observe your duty to Allah) fear Allah regarding usury, (and give up what remaineth (due to you) from usury) leave that which the Banu Makhzum owe you of usury, (if ye are (in truth) believers) if you really believe in the prohibition of usury."
فَإِن لَّمْ تَفْعَلُواْ فَأْذَنُواْ بِحَرْبٍ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ وَإِنْ تُبْتُمْ فَلَكُمْ رُؤُوسُ أَمْوَٰلِكُمْ لاَ تَظْلِمُونَ وَلاَ تُظْلَمُونَ,"(And if ye do not) if you do not abstain from usury, (then be warned of war (against you) from Allah and His Messenger) then be ready for a torment from God in the Hereafter by means of the Fire and its chastisement and also be ready for the sword from His Messenger in the life of this world. (And if ye repent) from usury, (then ye have your principal (without interest)) that is owed to you by the Banu Makhzum. (Wrong not) anyone by demanding interest, (and ye shall not be wronged) by anyone if they give you back your capitals; it is also said that 'wrong not' means: do not harm others; and 'you shall not be wronged' meaning: you shall not be harmed because of your debts."
وَإِن كَانَ ذُو عُسْرَةٍ فَنَظِرَةٌ إِلَىٰ مَيْسَرَةٍ وَأَن تَصَدَّقُواْ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ إِن كُنْتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ,"(And if the debtor) the Banu Makhzum (is in straitened circumstances, then (let there be) postponement to (the time of) ease; and that ye remit the debt as almsgiving would be better for you) than being paid or postponing the debt (if ye did but know) this."
وَٱتَّقُواْ يَوْماً تُرْجَعُونَ فِيهِ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ ثُمَّ تُوَفَّىٰ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ مَّا كَسَبَتْ وَهُمْ لاَ يُظْلَمُونَ,"(And guard yourselves against a day) fear the torment of a day (in which ye will be brought back to Allah. Then every soul) whether believing or disbelieving (will be paid full that which it hath earned) of good or evil, (and they will not be wronged) their rewards will not be decreased and their sins shall not be increased."

Let a scribe record it in writing between you) the indebted person and the creditor (in (terms of) equity) justice. (No scribe should refuse to write) the contract between the creditor and the debtor (as Allah hath taught him) how to write, (so let him write) the contract without addition or omission, (and let him who incurreth the debt dictate) i.e. the indebted person should explain to the scribe the debt he owes, (and let him observe his duty to Allah his Lord) let the indebted person fear his Lord, (and diminish naught thereof) and not diminish any amount of debt he owes upon dictation. (But if he who oweth the debt is of low understanding) is ignorant of dictation, (or weak) unable to dictate, (or unable himself to dictate) does not know how to dictate to the scribe, (then let the guardian of his interests dictate) the guardian of his wealth who is the creditor (in (terms of) equity) without any addition. (And call to witness) for your rights, (from among your men, two witnesses) from among your free, Muslim men who are of good character. (And if two men be not (at hand) then a man and two women, of such as ye approve as witnesses) from among people who are reliable in their witness, (so that if the one erreth (through forgetfulness)) so that if one of the women forgets (the other) who did not forget (will remind her. And the witnesses must not refuse) to give witness (when they are summoned) to court. (Be not averse) disinclined (to writing down) i.e. the debt (whether it be small or great, with (record of) the term thereof. That) i.e. that which I mentioned regarding the writing down of the debt (is more equitable) more correct and fairer (in the sight of Allah and more sure for testimony) clearer for the witness when he gives his testimony if he happens to forget, (and the best way of avoiding doubt between you) concerning the debt and the fixed term of its payment; (save only in the case when it is actual merchandise which you transfer among yourselves from hand to hand."
وَإِن كُنتُمْ عَلَىٰ سَفَرٍ وَلَمْ تَجِدُواْ كَاتِباً فَرِهَٰنٌ مَّقْبُوضَةٌ فَإِنْ أَمِنَ بَعْضُكُم بَعْضاً فَلْيُؤَدِّ ٱلَّذِي ٱؤْتُمِنَ أَمَانَتَهُ وَلْيَتَّقِ ٱللَّهَ رَبَّهُ وَلاَ تَكْتُمُواْ ٱلشَّهَٰدَةَ وَمَن يَكْتُمْهَا فَإِنَّهُ آثِمٌ قَلْبُهُ وَٱللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ عَلِيمٌ,"(If ye be on a journey and you cannot find a scribe) or the means by which to write, (then a pledge in hand (shall suffice)) then let the creditor take from the indebted person a security for his loan. (And if one of you entrusteth another) to give a loan without security (let him who is trusted) with the debt (deliver up that which is entrusted to him) the right of his creditor (and let him observe his duty to Allah, his Lord.) the debtor should fear Allah regarding repayment of his debt, (Hide not testimony) from the judges in court. (He who hideth it) i.e. his testimony, (surely his heart is sinful) his heart is impious. (Allah is Aware of what ye do) in relation to hiding or giving testimony."
للَّهِ ما فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوٰتِ وَمَا فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَإِن تُبْدُواْ مَا فِيۤ أَنْفُسِكُمْ أَوْ تُخْفُوهُ يُحَاسِبْكُمْ بِهِ ٱللَّهُ فَيَغْفِرُ لِمَن يَشَآءُ وَيُعَذِّبُ مَن يَشَآءُ وَٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,"(Unto Allah (belongeth) whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth) of created beings and marvels; He commands His servants with whatever He wills; (and whether ye make known what is in your minds) in your hearts; this refers to the discourse of the soul after the arousal of one's misgivings but before one divulges it (or hide it, Allah will bring you to account for it) Allah will requite you for it. The same applies to forgetfulness after one remembers, error after being right and coercion after exerting one's effort freely. (He will forgive whom He will) He will forgive the one who repents of all sins (and He will punish whom He will) He will punish the one who does not repent. (And Allah is Able to do all things) in terms of forgiveness and punishment."
ءَامَنَ ٱلرَّسُولُ بِمَآ أُنْزِلَ إِلَيْهِ مِن رَّبِّهِ وَٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ كُلٌّ آمَنَ بِٱللَّهِ وَمَلاۤئِكَتِهِ وَكُتُبِهِ وَرُسُلِهِ لاَ نُفَرِّقُ بَيْنَ أَحَدٍ مِّن رُّسُلِهِ وَقَالُواْ سَمِعْنَا وَأَطَعْنَا غُفْرَانَكَ رَبَّنَا وَإِلَيْكَ ٱلْمَصِيرُ,"When the last verse was revealed, the believers found its content disconcerting. So when the Prophet (pbuh) ascended to heaven he prostrated to his Lord, and Allah said in praise of His Prophet: (The Messenger believeth) the Messenger Muhammad (pbuh) believes (in that which hath been revealed unto him from his Lord) i.e. the Qur'an and its content, and then the Prophet (pbuh) said on behalf of his Lord (and (so do) the believers. Each one believeth in Allah and His angels and His scriptures and His messengers-We make no distinction between any of His messengers-) they say: we do not disbelieve in any of his messengers (and they say: We hear) the saying of our Lord, (and we obey) the command of our Lord, i.e. we hear and obey our Lord. The Prophet (pbuh) then said: ((Grant us) Thy forgiveness) forgive us for the discourse of our souls, (our Lord) O our Lord! (Unto Thee is the journeying) unto you is the return after death."
لاَ يُكَلِّفُ ٱللَّهُ نَفْساً إِلاَّ وُسْعَهَا لَهَا مَا كَسَبَتْ وَعَلَيْهَا مَا ٱكْتَسَبَتْ رَبَّنَا لاَ تُؤَاخِذْنَا إِن نَّسِينَآ أَوْ أَخْطَأْنَا رَبَّنَا وَلاَ تَحْمِلْ عَلَيْنَآ إِصْراً كَمَا حَمَلْتَهُ عَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِنَا رَبَّنَا وَلاَ تُحَمِّلْنَا مَا لاَ طَاقَةَ لَنَا بِهِ وَٱعْفُ عَنَّا وَٱغْفِرْ لَنَا وَٱرْحَمْنَآ أَنتَ مَوْلَٰـنَا فَٱنْصُرْنَا عَلَى ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلْكَافِرِينَ,"By way of response, Allah said: (Allah tasketh not a soul) in relation to acts of obedience (beyond its scope) beyond its capability. (For it (is only) that which it hath earned) of good, and of leaving the discourse of the soul, forgetfulness, error and coercion, (and against it (only) that which it hath deserved) of evil, the discourse of the soul, forgetfulness, and coercion. Allah taught the believers thereafter how they should pray to Him so as to lift the discourse of the soul, error, forgetfulness and coercion from them, saying that they should supplicate thus: (Our Lord!) O our Lord! (Condemn us not if we forget) to obey you, (or miss the mark!) regarding your command (Our Lord!) O our Lord! (Lay not on us such a burden) a covenant which, if we fail to honour, You will prohibit us from wholesome things (as Thou didst) as You made it unlawful (on those before us!) on the Children of Israel because they broke Your covenant regarding wholesome things: the meat of camels, the fat of bovines, small cattle and other things. (Our Lord!) O our Lord! (Impose not on us that which we have not the strength to bear!) that in which there is no comfort or benefit for us, and this is what is meant by coercion. (Pardon us) all this, (absolve us) from it (and have mercy on us) by means of it. (Thou, our Protector) You are more deserving of protecting us; (and give us victory over the disbelieving folk). It is also said that the meaning is as follows: (Pardon us) by not turning us into animals as you turned some of the people of Jesus into animals, (absolve us) from making the ground swallow us up as you made the ground swallow up Korah (Qarun); (and have mercy on us) by not being tossed up by the waves as you did to the people of Lot. When the believer called upon Allah with this supplication, Allah lifted from them the discourse of the soul, forgetfulness, error, coercion and absolved them from being turned into animals, making the ground swallow them or being tossed by the waves. All those who follow in their footsteps will be absolved from the same."
الۤمۤ,"And on his authority he related from Ibn 'Abbas regarding the saying of Allah, Exalted is He: (Alif. Lam. Mim.) that he said: 'Allah informed us about the story of the delegation of Najran; it is also said that this is an oath by which Allah swore that He is One and that He has neither progeny nor partner."
ٱللَّهُ لاۤ إِلَـٰهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ ٱلْحَيُّ ٱلْقَيُّومُ,"(Allah! There is no God save Him, the Alive) Who dies not and is not evanescent, (the Eternal) the Self-subsistent Who has no beginning."

مِن قَبْلُ هُدًى لِّلنَّاسِ وَأَنزَلَ ٱلْفُرْقَانَ إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ بِآيَاتِ ٱللَّهِ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ شَدِيدٌ وَٱللَّهُ عَزِيزٌ ذُو ٱنْتِقَامٍ,"(Aforetime) before Muhammad and the Qur'an, (for a guidance to mankind) as a guidance from error to the Children of Israel; (and hath revealed the Criterion (of right and wrong)) He revealed the Qur'an to Muhammad in instalments to differentiate the lawful from the unlawful. (Lo! those who disbelieve the revelations of Allah) Muhammad and the Qur'an, referring in this context to the delegation of Najran, (theirs will be a heavy doom) in this world and in the next. (Allah is Mighty) powerful in His vengeance, (Able to Requite (the wrong)) able to carry His vengeance out on them."
إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لاَ يَخْفَىٰ عَلَيْهِ شَيْءٌ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَلاَ فِي ٱلسَّمَآءِ,(Lo! nothing in the earth) of the story of the delegation of Najran (or in the heavens) concerning the angels (is hidden from Allah).

(There is no God) there is no fashioner or creator (save Him, the Almighty) Who is vengeful against whoever does not believe in Him, (the Wise) in creating what is in wombs."

(They are the substance of the Book) they are the foundation of the Book as they are the leading theme in each book. They are all acted upon. An example of this is the saying of Allah: (Say: Come, I will recite unto you that which your Lord hath made a sacred duty for you…) [6:151]. (And others (which are) allegorical) vague in their meanings to the Jews, like the use of the letters of the alphabet according to their numerical value (hisab al-Jumal) in such instances as Alif. Lam. Mim, Alif. Lam. Mim. Sad, Alif. Lam Mim. Ra; and Alif. Lam. Ra; it is also said that (others (which are) allegorical) means: other verses that are abrogated and no longer acted upon. (But those) the Jews Ka'b Ibn al-Ashraf, Huyayy Ibn Akhtab and Judayy Ibn Akhtab (in whose hearts is doubt) scepticism, opposition and deviance from guidance (pursue, forsooth, that which is allegorical seeking) in the Qur'an ((to cause) dissension) pursuing disbelief, ascribing partners to Allah, and holding fast to the error they are in (by seeking to explain it) to determine the future of this nation so that dominion reverts back to them. (None knoweth its explanation) the future of this nation (save Allah). Here Allah interrupts His speech and then resumes it by saying: (And those who are of sound instruction) those who have a sound grasp of the knowledge of the Torah: 'Abdullah Ibn Salam and his fellow companions (say: We believe therein) in the Qur'an; (the whole is from our Lord) Allah has revealed both those verses which are clear and those which are ambiguous; (but only men of understanding) who have sound minds such as 'Abdullah Ibn Salam and his fellow companions (really heed) take admonition from the simile of the Qur'an."
رَبَّنَا لاَ تُزِغْ قُلُوبَنَا بَعْدَ إِذْ هَدَيْتَنَا وَهَبْ لَنَا مِن لَّدُنْكَ رَحْمَةً إِنَّكَ أَنْتَ ٱلْوَهَّابُ,"(Our Lord!) these also say: O our Lord! (Cause not our hearts to stray) do not make our hearts deviate from Your Religion (after Thou hast guided us) to Your Religion, (and bestow upon us mercy from Thy Presence) make us firm in holding to Your religion. (Lo! Thou, only Thou art the Bestower) to the believers before us; it is also said that this means: You are the Bestower of prophethood and Islam to Muhammad."
رَبَّنَآ إِنَّكَ جَامِعُ ٱلنَّاسِ لِيَوْمٍ لاَّ رَيْبَ فِيهِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لاَ يُخْلِفُ ٱلْمِيعَادَ,"(Our Lord!) they say: O our Lord! (it is Thou Who gatherest mankind together) after they die (to a Day) on a day (of which there is no doubt. Lo! Allah faileth not to keep the tryst) resurrection after death, the reckoning, the Bridge over hell, the Scale, Paradise and hell."

(They will be fuel for fire) they are the firewood of hell.

(unto those who disbelieve) the unbelievers of Mecca: (Ye shall be overcome) You shall be killed on the Day of Badr (and gathered unto hell) on the Day of Judgement, (an evil resting place) an evil place and outcome."

It is also said that this can be understood in this way: Say, O Muhammad, to the unbelievers-the Banu Qurayzah and Banu'l-Nadir-you shall be overcome and killed and expelled, and after you die, you will be mustered in Gehenna, an evil abode and end. Allah informed them of this two years before the Battle of Badr took place. Then He revealed: O Jews! You had a sign for the prophethood of Muhammad (pbuh) in the form of two groups-that of Muhammad and that of Abu Sufyan-who met on the Day of Badr. One group (Muhammad (pbuh) and his Companions) fought in obedience of Allah, and the other group consisted of unbelievers in Allah and His Messenger (Abu Sufyan and his group). You saw with your very eyes, O Jews, that the unbelievers were twice the number of the Companions of Muhammad. (Thus Allah strengtheneth with His succour whom He will) i.e. Muhammad. (Lo! Herein) in Allah enabling Muhammad to triumph on the Day of Badr (verily is a lesson for those who have eyes) concerning Religion, i.e. the believers; it is also said that this means: it was a lesson for those who saw it with their own eyes."

(That) which is mentioned above (is comfort of the life of the world) is of benefit to people in the life of this world and then it vanishes; it is also said that this means: the joys of this world last only for as long as the stuff of any home, a bowl, a plate and the like. (Allah! With Him is a more excellent abode) in the Hereafter, i.e. Paradise, to whoever shun such joys."
قُلْ أَؤُنَبِّئُكُمْ بِخَيْرٍ مِّن ذٰلِكُمْ لِلَّذِينَ ٱتَّقَوْا عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ جَنَّاتٌ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلأَنْهَارُ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا وَأَزْوَاجٌ مُّطَهَّرَةٌ وَرِضْوَانٌ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَٱللَّهُ بَصِيرٌ بِٱلْعِبَادِ,"Then Allah elucidated the bliss of the Hereafter, its permanence and favour, just as He exposited the joys of the life of this world, by saying: (Say) O Muhammad, to the unbelievers: (Shall I inform you of something better than that?) better than the embellishments of this world. (For those who keep from evil) keep from disbelief, ascribing partners to Allah and indecencies, in reference to Abu Bakr and his fellow believers, (with their Lord, are Gardens beneath which) beneath its trees and habitations (rivers) of wine, honey, milk and water (flow, wherein they will abide for ever) they will dwell in Paradise: they shall neither die nor leave it (and pure companions) they have therein spouses who are spared menses and filth, (and contentment from Allah) and the contentment of Allah is far greater than the bliss they enjoy. (Allah is Seer of His bondmen) He is Seer of the believers, their places in Paradise, as well as their works in the life of this world."
ٱلَّذِينَ يَقُولُونَ رَبَّنَآ إِنَّنَآ آمَنَّا فَٱغْفِرْ لَنَا ذُنُوبَنَا وَقِنَا عَذَابَ ٱلنَّارِ,"Allah then proceeds to describe them, saying: (Those who say) in the life of this world: (Our Lord!) O our Lord! (Lo! we believe) in You and in Your Messenger. (So forgive us our sins) that we committed in the pre-Islamic period as well as after the advent of Islam (and guard us from the punishment of Fire) drive away from us the punishment of hell;"
ٱلصَّابِرِينَ وَٱلصَّادِقِينَ وَٱلْقَانِتِينَ وَٱلْمُنْفِقِينَ وَٱلْمُسْتَغْفِرِينَ بِٱلأَسْحَارِ,"(The steadfast) in performing the obligations enjoined by Allah and in shunning contraventions against Him; it is also said that this means: the steadfast when misfortunes befall them, (and the Truthful) in their faith, (and the obedient) vis-à-vis Allah and His Messenger, (those who spend) their wealth in the way of Allah, (those who pray for pardon in the watches of the night) supererogatory prayers."
شَهِدَ ٱللَّهُ أَنَّهُ لاَ إِلَـٰهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ وَٱلْمَلاَئِكَةُ وَأُوْلُواْ ٱلْعِلْمِ قَآئِمَاً بِٱلْقِسْطِ لاَ إِلَـٰهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ,"Allah declared then His divine Oneness, saying: (Allah (Himself) is witness) even if no one else bears witness (that there is no God save Him. And the angels) do also bear witness to that (and the men of learning) and the prophets and the believers bear witness to that. (Maintaining His creation in justice, there is no God save Him, the Almighty) in His vengeance against those who do not believe in Him, (the Wise) and He has commanded that none shall be worshipped except Him."
إِنَّ ٱلدِّينَ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ ٱلإِسْلاَمُ وَمَا ٱخْتَلَفَ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ ٱلْكِتَابَ إِلاَّ مِن بَعْدِ مَا جَآءَهُمُ ٱلْعِلْمُ بَغْياً بَيْنَهُمْ وَمَن يَكْفُرْ بِآيَاتِ ٱللَّهِ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ سَرِيعُ ٱلْحِسَابِ,"(Lo! Religion) that is accepted (with Allah (is) the Surrender (to His will and guidance)). It is also said that this should be understood as: Allah bears witness that Religion with Him is Islam (the Surrender), and the angels, the prophets and the believers also bear witness to this. This verse was revealed about two men from Historic Syria who asked the Prophet (pbuh) which is the greatest witness in the Book of Allah. When he informed them about it, they embraced Islam. (Those who (formerly) received the Scripture) the Jews and Christians (differed) about Islam and Muhammad (only after knowledge) the exposition of what is in their Scripture (came unto them, through transgression among themselves) out of resentful envy. (Whoso disbelieveth the revelations of Allah) Muhammad and the Qur'an ((will find that) Lo! Allah is swift at reckoning) severe in His punishment."
فَإنْ حَآجُّوكَ فَقُلْ أَسْلَمْتُ وَجْهِيَ للَّهِ وَمَنِ ٱتَّبَعَنِ وَقُلْ لِّلَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ وَٱلأُمِّيِّينَ أَأَسْلَمْتُمْ فَإِنْ أَسْلَمُواْ فَقَدِ ٱهْتَدَواْ وَّإِن تَوَلَّوْاْ فَإِنَّمَا عَلَيْكَ ٱلْبَلَٰغُ وَٱللَّهُ بَصِيرٌ بِٱلْعِبَادِ,"Allah then mentions their argument with the Prophet (pbuh) about the Religion of Islam, saying: (And if they) i.e. the Jews and Christians (argue with thee, O Muhammad, say: I have surrendered my purpose) I make my Religion and works sincere (to Allah and (so have) those who follow me. And say unto those who have received the Scripture) the Jews and Christians (and those who read not) i.e. the Arabs: (Have ye (too) surrendered?) do you surrender as we have surrendered? Allah then said: (If they surrender) as you have surrendered, (then truly they are rightly guided) from error, (and if they turn away) from surrender, (then it is your duty only to convey the message (unto them)) on behalf of Allah. (Allah is Seer of (His) bondmen) those who believe and those who do not."
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يَكْفُرُونَ بِآيَاتِ ٱللَّهِ وَيَقْتُلُونَ ٱلنَّبِيِّينَ بِغَيْرِ حَقٍّ وَيَقْتُلُونَ ٱلَّذِينَ يَأْمُرُونَ بِٱلْقِسْطِ مِنَ ٱلنَّاسِ فَبَشِّرْهُم بِعَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ,"(Lo! those who disbelieve the revelations of Allah) in Muhammad and the Qur'an, (and slay the Prophets) i.e. ally themselves with those who slay the prophets (wrongfully) without them having committed any crime, (and slay those of mankind) who believed in the prophets (who enjoin equity) Allah's divine Oneness: (promise them a painful doom) which will spread out to their hearts."
أُولَـٰئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ حَبِطَتْ أَعْمَالُهُمْ فِي ٱلدُّنْيَا وَٱلآخِرَةِ وَمَا لَهُمْ مِّن نَّاصِرِينَ,"(Those are they whose works) good deeds (have failed) made void (in the world and the Hereafter) that is, they will not be given reward for them in the Hereafter; (and they have no helpers) who will save them from Allah's punishment."
أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ نَصِيباً مِّنَ ٱلْكِتَابِ يُدْعَوْنَ إِلَىٰ كِتَابِ ٱللَّهِ لِيَحْكُمَ بَيْنَهُمْ ثُمَّ يَتَوَلَّىٰ فَرِيقٌ مِّنْهُمْ وَهُمْ مُّعْرِضُونَ,"Allah mentions after this the rejection of stoning by the Banu Qurayzah and Banu'l-Nadir from among the people of Khaybar, saying: (Hast thou not seen) O Muhammad! (how those who have received the Scripture) were given knowledge about what is in the Torah regarding stoning and other things (invoke the Scripture of Allah) the Qur'an ((in their disputes) that it may judge between them) about stoning the married man and married woman who committed adultery in Khaybar, as is in their Scripture; (then a faction of them) from Banu Qurayzah and the people of Khaybar (turn away) from the judgement, (being opposed (to it)) denying that judgement."
ذٰلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ قَالُواْ لَن تَمَسَّنَا ٱلنَّارُ إِلاَّ أَيَّاماً مَّعْدُودَاتٍ وَغَرَّهُمْ فِي دِينِهِمْ مَّا كَانُواْ يَفْتَرُونَ,"(That) opposition, denial and punishment (is because they say: The Fire will not touch us) in the Hereafter (save for a certain number of days) about 40 days. A group from among the Jews said: the Fire will not touch us except for a limited number of days: seven days of days of the Hereafter-each day equalling a thousand years-as punishment for the days in which our forefathers worshipped the calf. (That which they used to invent has deceived them) their lie about not being punished; it is also said this refers to their claim that punishment shall be postponed (regarding their religion) i.e. their firm adherence to their religion: Judaism."
فَكَيْفَ إِذَا جَمَعْنَاهُمْ لِيَوْمٍ لاَّ رَيْبَ فِيهِ وَوُفِّيَتْ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ مَّا كَسَبَتْ وَهُمْ لاَ يُظْلَمُونَ,"(How (will it be with them)) how shall they act, O Muhammad, (when We have brought them all together) after they die (to a Day) on a day (of which there is no doubt, when every soul) righteous or sinner (will be paid in full what it has earned) of good or evil, (and they will not be wronged) their good works will not be decreased and their sins will not be increased."
قُلِ ٱللَّهُمَّ مَالِكَ ٱلْمُلْكِ تُؤْتِي ٱلْمُلْكَ مَن تَشَآءُ وَتَنزِعُ ٱلْمُلْكَ مِمَّنْ تَشَآءُ وَتُعِزُّ مَن تَشَآءُ وَتُذِلُّ مَن تَشَآءُ بِيَدِكَ ٱلْخَيْرُ إِنَّكَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,"(Say: O Allah!) say O Allah! Lead us to goodness (Owner of Sovereignty!) O Master of kings and Owner of sovereignty (Thou givest sovereignty unto whom Thou wilt) i.e. unto Muhammad and his followers, (and Thou withdrawest sovereignty from whom Thou wilt) i.e. from the people of Persia and Byzantium. (Thou exaltest whom Thou wilt) i.e. Muhammad (and Thou abasest whom Thou wilt) i.e. 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy Ibn Salul, the people of Persia and the people of Byzantium. (In Thy hand is the good) exaltation, abasement, sovereignty, spoils, triumph and power. (Lo! Thou art Able to do all things) whether it is exaltation, abasement, sovereignty, spoils, triumph or power. This verse was revealed about 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy Ibn Salul, the hypocrite, who said after the Conquest of Mecca: “How on earth can they have sovereignty over Persia and Byzantium?” It is also said that it was revealed about the Quraysh who said: “the king of Persia sleeps on couches made of silk brocade, if you are truly a prophet, show us your dominion?”"
تُولِجُ ٱللَّيْلَ فِي ٱلْنَّهَارِ وَتُولِجُ ٱلنَّهَارَ فِي ٱلْلَّيْلِ وَتُخْرِجُ ٱلْحَيَّ مِنَ ٱلْمَيِّتِ وَتُخْرِجُ ٱلَمَيِّتَ مِنَ ٱلْحَيِّ وَتَرْزُقُ مَن تَشَآءُ بِغَيْرِ حِسَابٍ,"Then he showed Allah's might by saying: (Thou causest the night to pass into the day) You increase the length of the day over the length of the night, such that the day is longer than the night, (and Thou causest the day to pass into the night) You increase the length of the night over the length of the day, such that the night is longer than the day. (And Thou bringest forth the living from the dead) He says: You bring forth a living creature from a sperm drop, (and Thou bringest forth the dead from the living) and You bring forth a sperm drop from man; it is also said that this verse means: You bring forth the living (a chicken) from the dead (an egg), and You bring forth the dead (a grain) from the living (a spike of grain). (And Thou givest sustenance to whom Thou choosest, without stint) without measure, exerting power or showing off Your blessings; it is also said that this means: You give wealth in abundance to whomever You choose without straitness or inconvenience."
لاَّ يَتَّخِذِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ ٱلْكَافِرِينَ أَوْلِيَآءَ مِن دُونِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَمَن يَفْعَلْ ذٰلِكَ فَلَيْسَ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ فِي شَيْءٍ إِلاَّ أَن تَتَّقُواْ مِنْهُمْ تُقَـٰةً وَيُحَذِّرُكُمُ ٱللَّهُ نَفْسَهُ وَإِلَىٰ ٱللَّهِ ٱلْمَصِيرُ,"(Let not the believers take) the believers ought not to take [the hypocrites:] 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy and his companions [and] (disbelievers) the Jews (for their friends) so as to become mighty and honourable (in preference to believers) who are sincere. (Whoso doeth that) seeking might and honour [by taking the hypocrites and disbelievers as friends] (hath no connection with Allah) has no honour, mercy or protection from Allah (unless (it be) that ye but guard yourselves against them) save yourselves from them, (taking (as it were) security) saving yourselves from them by speaking in a friendly way towards them with, while your hearts dislikes this. (Allah bideth you beware (only) of Himself) regarding the shunning of unlawful killing, unlawful sex, unlawful property, consuming intoxicants, false testimony and associating partners with Allah. (Unto Allah is the journeying) the return after death."
قُلْ إِن تُخْفُواْ مَا فِي صُدُورِكُمْ أَوْ تُبْدُوهُ يَعْلَمْهُ ٱللَّهُ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,"(Say) O Muhammad!: (Whether ye hide that which is in your breasts) what is in your hearts of hatred and enmity towards Muhammad (pbuh) (or reveal it) by showing abuse, defamation and waging war, (Allah knoweth it) Allah will record it and requite for it. (He knoweth that which is in the heavens and that which is in the earth) of good and evil, what is secret and what is revealed, (and Allah is Able to do all things) regarding the dwellers of the heavens and the dwellers of earth. This verse was revealed about the hypocrites and the Jews."
يَوْمَ تَجِدُ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ مَّا عَمِلَتْ مِنْ خَيْرٍ مُّحْضَراً وَمَا عَمِلَتْ مِن سُوۤءٍ تَوَدُّ لَوْ أَنَّ بَيْنَهَا وَبَيْنَهُ أَمَدَاً بَعِيداً وَيُحَذِّرُكُمُ ٱللَّهُ نَفْسَهُ وَٱللَّهُ رَؤُوفٌ بِٱلْعِبَادِ,(On the day) the Day of Judgement (when every soul will find itself confronted with all that it hath done) written in its register (of good and all that it hath done of evil) it will also find it written in its register ((every soul) will long that there might be a mighty apace of distance) a long period of time separating them: from sunrise to sunset (between it and that (evil). Allah bideth you beware of Him) upon committing an act of disobedience. (And Allah is full of pity for (His) bondmen) He is full of pity for the believers.
قُلْ إِن كُنتُمْ تُحِبُّونَ ٱللَّهَ فَٱتَّبِعُونِي يُحْبِبْكُمُ ٱللَّهُ وَيَغْفِرْ لَكُمْ ذُنُوبَكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"(Say) O Muhammad!: (If ye love Allah) and His religion, (follow me) follow my Religion; (Allah will love you) He will increase your love (and forgive you your sins) which were committed when you followed Judaism. (Allah is Forgiving) of whoever repents, (Merciful) towards whoever dies in a state of repentance. This verse was revealed about the Jews who claimed they were the children of Allah and His beloved ones. When this verse was revealed 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy said: “Muhammad is commanding us to love him as the Christians loved Jesus”, and the Jews said: “Muhammad wants us to take him as a compassionate Lord, just as the Christians took Jesus as a compassionate Lord”."
قُلْ أَطِيعُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَٱلرَّسُولَ فإِن تَوَلَّوْاْ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لاَ يُحِبُّ ٱلْكَافِرِينَ,"Consequently, Allah revealed about their comments: (Say: Obey Allah) regarding what He has obligated (and the Messenger) in his practices. (But if they turn away) from obeying them, (Lo! Allah loveth not the disbelievers) the Jews and the hypocrites."
إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ ٱصْطَفَىٰ ءَادَمَ وَنُوحاً وَآلَ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَآلَ عِمْرَانَ عَلَى ٱلْعَالَمِينَ,"When the Jews heard this, they said: “we follow the religion of Adam: we are Muslims”, and so Allah revealed the following: (Lo! Allah preferred Adam) with Islam (and Noah) with Islam (and the Family of Abraham) the children of Abraham with Islam (and the Family of 'Imran) Moses and Aaron with Islam (above (all His) creatures) above all the people of their times. It is also said that Amran is not the father of Moses and Aaron."
ذُرِّيَّةً بَعْضُهَا مِن بَعْضٍ وَٱللَّهُ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ,"(They were descendants one of another) some follow the religion of others and the offspring of some are the descendents of others. (Allah is Hearer) of what the Jews say: that they are Allah's children and beloved ones and that they follow His religion, (Knower) of their punishment and of whom is following His religion."
إِذْ قَالَتِ ٱمْرَأَتُ عِمْرَانَ رَبِّ إِنِّي نَذَرْتُ لَكَ مَا فِي بَطْنِي مُحَرَّراً فَتَقَبَّلْ مِنِّي إِنَّكَ أَنتَ ٱلسَّمِيعُ ٱلْعَلِيمُ,"Remember, O Muhammad (When the wife of Imran) Hannah, the mother of Mary (said: My Lord I have vowed unto Thee that which is in my belly as a consecrated (offering)) a servant at the Sanctuary of Jerusalem. (Accept it from me. Lo! Thou, only Thou, art the Hearer) of prayers, (the Knower!) of the answer and of that which is in my womb."
فَلَمَّا وَضَعَتْهَا قَالَتْ رَبِّ إِنِّي وَضَعْتُهَآ أُنْثَىٰ وَٱللَّهُ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا وَضَعَتْ وَلَيْسَ ٱلذَّكَرُ كَٱلأُنْثَىٰ وَإِنِّي سَمَّيْتُهَا مَرْيَمَ وِإِنِّي أُعِيذُهَا بِكَ وَذُرِّيَّتَهَا مِنَ ٱلشَّيْطَانِ ٱلرَّجِيمِ,"(And when she was delivered) what was in her womb and it was a baby girl (she said: My Lord! Lo! I am delivered of a female) a baby girl. (Allah knew best of what she was delivered. The male is not as the female) in service and weakness; (and Lo! I have named her Mary, and Lo! I crave Thy protection for her) I seek for her Your protection and safety (and for her offspring from Satan the outcast) the accursed."
فَتَقَبَّلَهَا رَبُّهَا بِقَبُولٍ حَسَنٍ وَأَنبَتَهَا نَبَاتاً حَسَناً وَكَفَّلَهَا زَكَرِيَّا كُلَّمَا دَخَلَ عَلَيْهَا زَكَرِيَّا ٱلْمِحْرَابَ وَجَدَ عِندَهَا رِزْقاً قَالَ يٰمَرْيَمُ أَنَّىٰ لَكِ هَـٰذَا قَالَتْ هُوَ مِنْ عِندِ ٱللَّهِ إِنَّ ٱللًّهَ يَرْزُقُ مَن يَشَآءُ بِغَيْرِ حِسَابٍ,"(And her Lord accepted her with full acceptance) He was good to her and accepted her instead of accepting a boy (and vouchsafed to her a goodly growth) He nurtured her well in worship throughout the years, months, days and hours; (and made Zachariah her guardian) he joined her to him for training. (Whenever Zachariah went into the sanctuary where she was) the room where she worshipped, (he found that she had food) the fruit of winter in the summer, such as culms of corn, and the fruits of summer in the winter such as grapes. (He said: O Mary! Whence cometh unto thee this (food)?) how did you get this food out of its season? (She answered: It is from Allah) Gabriel brought it to me. (Allah giveth without stint) without pause or measure (to whom He will) in its season or out of it."
هُنَالِكَ دَعَا زَكَرِيَّا رَبَّهُ قَالَ رَبِّ هَبْ لِي مِن لَّدُنْكَ ذُرِّيَّةً طَيِّبَةً إِنَّكَ سَمِيعُ ٱلدُّعَآءِ,(Then) at that point (Zachariah prayed unto) and wished from (his Lord and said: My Lord! Bestow upon me of Thy bounty) from You (goodly offspring) a righteous child. (Lo! Thou art the Hearer of Prayer) You are the One Who answers prayers.
فَنَادَتْهُ ٱلْمَلاۤئِكَةُ وَهُوَ قَائِمٌ يُصَلِّي فِي ٱلْمِحْرَابِ أَنَّ اللَّهَ يُبَشِّرُكَ بِيَحْيَـىٰ مُصَدِّقاً بِكَلِمَةٍ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَسَيِّداً وَحَصُوراً وَنَبِيّاً مِّنَ ٱلصَّالِحِينَ,"(And the angels) i.e. the Angel Gabriel (called to him as he stood praying in the sanctuary) in the mosque: (Allah giveth thee glad tidings of John) a son whose name is John, ((who cometh) to confirm a Word from Allah) Jesus son of Mary that he will be a word from Allah, created without a father, (lordly) who is clement when wronged, (chaste) has no desire for women, (a Prophet of the righteous) among the messengers."
قَالَ رَبِّ أَنَّىٰ يَكُونُ لِي غُلاَمٌ وَقَدْ بَلَغَنِي ٱلْكِبَرُ وَٱمْرَأَتِي عَاقِرٌ قَالَ كَذَلِكَ ٱللَّهُ يَفْعَلُ مَا يَشَآءُ,(He said: My Lord) Zachariah said to Gabriel: O master! (How can I have a son when age hath overtaken me already) when I am very old (and my wife is barren) and cannot conceive children? ((The angel) answered: So (it will be)) as I have told you. (Allah doeth what He will).
قَالَ رَبِّ ٱجْعَلْ لِّيۤ آيَةً قَالَ آيَتُكَ أَلاَّ تُكَلِّمَ ٱلنَّاسَ ثَلاَثَةَ أَيَّامٍ إِلاَّ رَمْزاً وَٱذْكُر رَّبَّكَ كَثِيراً وَسَبِّحْ بِٱلْعَشِيِّ وَٱلإِبْكَارِ,"(He) Zachariah (said: My Lord) O my Lord! (Appoint a token for me) regarding my wife's pregnancy. ((The angel) said: The token unto thee) about your wife's pregnancy ((shall be) that thou shalt not speak) will not be able to speak (unto mankind three days) without being dumb (except by signs) by moving your lips, eyebrows, eyes and hands; it is also said: except by writing on the ground. (Remember your Lord) with your tongue and heart (much) in all circumstances, (and praise (Him) in the early hours of night and morning) pray in the morning and at night as you used to do."
وَإِذْ قَالَتِ ٱلْمَلاَئِكَةُ يٰمَرْيَمُ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ ٱصْطَفَـٰكِ وَطَهَّرَكِ وَٱصْطَفَـٰكِ عَلَىٰ نِسَآءِ ٱلْعَـٰلَمِينَ,"(And when the angels) i.e. Gabriel (said: O Mary! Lo! Allah hath chosen thee) with Islam and worship (and made thee pure) from disbelief, the association of partners with Allah and blemishes; it is also said this means: He has saved you from being killed, (and hath preferred you above (all) the women of creation) of your time by the birth of Jesus."
يٰمَرْيَمُ ٱقْنُتِي لِرَبِّكِ وَٱسْجُدِي وَٱرْكَعِي مَعَ ٱلرَّاكِعِينَ,"(O Mary! Be obedient to thy Lord) as a token of gratitude to Him; it is also said this means: prolong your prayer as a token of gratitude to your Lord, (prostrate thyself and bow) meaning: and do also prostrate and bow (with those who bow (in worship)) with the people of worship."
ذٰلِكَ مِنْ أَنَبَآءِ ٱلْغَيْبِ نُوحِيهِ إِلَيكَ وَمَا كُنتَ لَدَيْهِمْ إِذْ يُلْقُون أَقْلاَمَهُمْ أَيُّهُمْ يَكْفُلُ مَرْيَمَ وَمَا كُنْتَ لَدَيْهِمْ إِذْ يَخْتَصِمُونَ,"(This) which I mentioned of the story of Mary and Zachariah (is of the tidings of things hidden) of the things that were unknown to you, O Muhammad. (We reveal it unto thee (Muhammad)) He says: We send Gabriel with it to you. (Thou wast not present with them) with the Rabbis (when they threw their pens) in the flow of water ((to know) which of them should be the guardian of Mary) to train her, (nor wast thou present with them when they quarrelled (thereupon)) each giving argument for his better claim to be Mary's guardian."

Allah giveth you glad tidings of a Word from Him) of a son who shall come into being by means of a Word from Allah, (whose name is the Messiah) because he travels from one country to another; it is also said: the Messiah means the king, (Jesus, son of Mary, illustrious in the world) he has standing and position amidst people in the life of this world (and the Hereafter) he has standing and position with Allah, (and one of those brought near) unto Allah in the Garden of Eden."
وَيُكَلِّمُ ٱلنَّاسَ فِي ٱلْمَهْدِ وَكَهْلاً وَمِنَ ٱلصَّالِحِينَ,"(He will speak unto mankind in his cradle) in the lap of his mother, saying: I am the servant of Allah and His Messiah (and in his manhood) after he reaches 30 years old, saying that he is a prophet, (and he is of the righteous) of the messengers."

Mary said to Gabriel: O master!: (How can I have a child) how is it possible for me to have a child (when no mortal hath touched me?) lawfully or unlawfully? (He) Gabriel (said: So (it will be)) as I have told you. (Allah createth what He will. If He decreeth a thing) if He wills to create a son from you without a father, (He saith unto it only: Be! and it is) a son without a father."
وَيُعَلِّمُهُ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ وَٱلْحِكْمَةَ وَٱلتَّوْرَاةَ وَٱلإِنْجِيلَ,"(And He will teach him the Scripture) the Scriptures of [past] prophets; as it is said: writing (and wisdom) the lawful and the prohibited; as it said this means: the wisdom of the prophets who preceded him, (and the Torah) in the womb of his mother (and the Gospel) after he came out of his mother's womb."

I come unto you with a sign) a token (from your Lord) for my prophethood. They said: what is this sign? He replied: (Lo! I fashion for you out of clay the likeness of a bird, and I breathe into it) like the breathing of a sleeping person (and it is a bird) flying in the air, (by Allah's leave) by Allah's command. Then he fashioned for them a bat and when it became alive, they said: this is sorcery; do you have another sign? He said: yes, (I heal him who was born blind, and the leper) also, (and I raise the dead, by Allah's leave) by Allah's greatest Name: O Alive, the Eternal. And when he did this, they said: this is sorcery, do you have any other sign? He said: yes, (And I announce unto you what you eat) in the morning and at night (and what you store up in your houses) what you save from your lunch to dinner and from your dinner to the next day's lunch. (Lo! Herein) in that which I have told you (verily is a portent) a sign (for you, if ye are believers) who have faith."

(I come unto you with a sign) with a token (from your Lord, so keep your duty to Allah) so fear Allah in that which He has commanded you with and repent to Him (and obey me) and follow my command and Religion;"

(We believe in Allah, and bear thou witness) Know, O Jesus (that we have surrendered (unto Him)) we acknowledge Allah by worshipping Him and declaring His divine Oneness."

I am gathering thee and causing thee to ascend unto Me, and am cleansing) saving (thee of those who disbelieve) in you (and am setting those who follow you) follow your Religion (above those who disbelieve) with strong argument and triumph (until the Day of Resurrection) then I shall make you to die after descent; it is also said this means: I shall make your heart die to the love of the life of this world. (Then unto Me ye will (all) return) after death, (and I shall judge between you as to that wherein) in religion (ye used to differ) to argue."
فَأَمَّا ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ فَأُعَذِّبُهُمْ عَذَاباً شَدِيداً فِي ٱلدُّنْيَا وَٱلآخِرَةِ وَمَا لَهُمْ مِّن نَّاصِرِينَ,(As for those who disbelieve) in Allah and in His messengers Muhammad and Jesus (I shall chastise them with a heavy chastisement in the world) by exposing them to the sword and the capitation tax (jizyah) (and the Hereafter) by throwing them into the Fire; (and they will have no helpers) to save them from Allah's punishment in this world or in the Hereafter.
وَأَمَّا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ فَيُوَفِّيهِمْ أُجُورَهُمْ وَٱللَّهُ لاَ يُحِبُّ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ,"(And as for those who believe) in Allah, the Scripture and His messengers Muhammad and Jesus (and do good works) sincerely between them and their Lord, (He will pay them their wages in full) He will pay them their reward on the Day of Judgement.

ذٰلِكَ نَتْلُوهُ عَلَيْكَ مِنَ الآيَاتِ وَٱلذِّكْرِ ٱلْحَكِيمِ,"(This) that I have told you about, O Muhammad, regarding the story of Jesus ((which) We recite unto thee) with which We send Gabriel to you (is a revelation) He says: they are revelations of the Qur'an, conveying commands and prohibitions (and a wise reminder) that enjoins what is lawful and what is unlawful; it is also said this means: it corroborates the Torah and the Gospel; and it is also said this means: it confirms that which is in the Guarded Tablet."
إِنَّ مَثَلَ عِيسَىٰ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ كَمَثَلِ ءَادَمَ خَلَقَهُ مِن تُرَابٍ ثُمَّ قَالَ لَهُ كُن فَيَكُونُ,"Allah then explained the creation of Jesus without a father because the delegation of Najran asked the Prophet to provide proof from the Qur'an for his saying that Jesus was not the son of Allah, so Allah said: (Lo! the likeness of Jesus) the likeness of the creation of Jesus (with Allah) without a father (is as the likeness of Adam. He created him of dust) without a father or mother, (then He said unto him) to Jesus: (Be! and he is) a son without a father."
ٱلْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّكَ فَلاَ تَكُنْ مِّن ٱلْمُمْتَرِينَ,"((This is) the Truth) this is the true fact (from your Lord) that Jesus was not Allah, His son or His partner, (so be not thou of those who waver) those who doubt what I have exposited to you regarding the creation of Jesus without a father."

As response Allah said: (And whoso disputeth with thee concerning him) concerning Jesus, (after the knowledge which has come unto thee) after the exposition that has come to you that Jesus was not Allah, His son or His partner, (say (unto him): Come! We will summon our sons and your sons) and you summon your sons, (and our women and your women) and you summon your women, (and ourselves and yourselves, then we will pray humbly (to our Lord)) and exert our effort in praying ((and (solemnly) invoke) all together (the curse of Allah upon those who lie) about Allah concerning Jesus."
إِنَّ هَـٰذَا لَهُوَ ٱلْقَصَصُ ٱلْحَقُّ وَمَا مِنْ إِلَـٰهٍ إِلاَّ ٱللَّهُ وَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَهُوَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ,"(Lo! This) which We have mentioned, O Muhammad, regarding Jesus and the delegation of Najran (verily is the true narrative) the true fact that Jesus was not Allah, His son or His partner. (There is no God save Allah) without a son or partner, (and lo! Allah is the Mighty) Who is vengeful against those who do not believe in Him, (the Wise) Who has commanded that none should be worshipped except Him; it is also said (the Wise) means: Allah ruled that they should go out and invoke His curse on those who lie, but the delegation of Najran refused to do so because they knew they were liars and that Muhammad was a true Prophet and emissary whose traits and description were to be found in their own Scripture."
فَإِن تَوَلَّوْاْ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلِيمٌ بِٱلْمُفْسِدِينَ,(And if they turn away) from joining the Prophet (pbuh) in invoking Allah's curse on those who lie about Him regarding Jesus (then Lo! Allah is Aware of (who are) the corrupters) i.e. the Christians of Najran.
قُلْ يٰأَهْلَ ٱلْكِتَابِ تَعَالَوْاْ إِلَىٰ كَلِمَةٍ سَوَآءٍ بَيْنَنَا وَبَيْنَكُمْ أَلاَّ نَعْبُدَ إِلاَّ ٱللَّهَ وَلاَ نُشْرِكَ بِهِ شَيْئاً وَلاَ يَتَّخِذَ بَعْضُنَا بَعْضاً أَرْبَاباً مِّن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ فَإِن تَوَلَّوْاْ فَقُولُواْ ٱشْهَدُواْ بِأَنَّا مُسْلِمُونَ,"After this, Allah invited them to accept Allah's divine Oneness, saying: (Say: O People of the Scripture. Come to an agreement) the agreement is: there is no god except Allah (between us and you: that we shall worship none but Allah) we shall declare Allah as the only One God, (and that we shall ascribe no partners unto Him) from among created beings, (and that none of us shall take others for lords beside Allah) that none of us shall obey another person in that which involves a transgression against Allah. (And if they turn away) and refuse to accept Allah's divine Oneness, (then say: Bear witness) know (that we are they who have surrendered (unto Him)) and acknowledge His divine Oneness and worship Him."
يٰأَهْلَ ٱلْكِتَابِ لِمَ تُحَآجُّونَ فِيۤ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَمَآ أُنزِلَتِ ٱلتَّورَاةُ وَٱلإنْجِيلُ إِلاَّ مِن بَعْدِهِ أَفَلاَ تَعْقِلُونَ,"Then Allah mentions their dispute with the Prophet (pbuh) in that they said they are of those who have surrendered to Allah and follow the Religion of Abraham, claiming this to be in the Torah. So Allah said: (O People of the Scripture! Why will ye argue about Abraham, when the Torah and the Gospel were not revealed till after him?) after Abraham. (Have ye then no sense?) that it is not mentioned in them that Abraham was Jew or Christian."
هٰأَنْتُمْ هَؤُلاۤءِ حَاجَجْتُمْ فِيمَا لَكُم بِهِ عِلمٌ فَلِمَ تُحَآجُّونَ فِيمَا لَيْسَ لَكُمْ بِهِ عِلْمٌ وَٱللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ وَأَنْتُمْ لاَ تَعْلَمُونَ,"(Lo! Ye) O Jews and Christians (are those who argue about that whereof ye have some knowledge) in your Scripture that Muhammad is a prophet sent by Allah and that Abraham was neither Jew nor Christian, but you rejected this: (Why then argue ye concerning that whereof ye have no knowledge) from your Scripture and say that Abraham was Jew or Christian? (Allah knoweth) that Abraham was neither Jew nor Christian. (Ye know not) that he was Jew or Christian."
مَا كَانَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ يَهُودِيّاً وَلاَ نَصْرَانِيّاً وَلَكِن كَانَ حَنِيفاً مُّسْلِماً وَمَا كَانَ مِنَ ٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ,"Allah then denied their claim, saying: (Abraham was not a Jew) following the religion of the Jews, (nor yet a Christian) following the religion of the Christians; (but he was an upright man who had surrendered (to Allah)) sincerely, (and he was not of the idolaters) who adhered to their religions."
إِنَّ أَوْلَى ٱلنَّاسِ بِإِبْرَاهِيمَ لَلَّذِينَ ٱتَّبَعُوهُ وَهَـٰذَا ٱلنَّبِيُّ وَٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَٱللَّهُ وَلِيُّ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,"Then Allah showed who follows the Religion of Abraham, saying: (Lo! those of mankind who have the best claim to Abraham) to the Religion of Abraham (are those who followed him) in his time, (and this Prophet) Muhammad follows his Religion (and those who believe) in Muhammad and in the Qur'an also follow the Religion of Abraham; (and Allah is the Protecting Friend of the believers) He protects them and helps them."
وَدَّت طَّآئِفَةٌ مِّنْ أَهْلِ ٱلْكِتَابِ لَوْ يُضِلُّونَكُمْ وَمَا يُضِلُّونَ إِلاَّ أَنْفُسَهُمْ وَمَا يَشْعُرُونَ,"Allah mentions, then, how Ka'b al-Ashraf invited some of the companions of Allah's Messenger (pbuh)-Mu'adh [Ibn Jabal], Hudhayfa [Ibn al-Yaman] and 'Ammar [Ibn Yasir]-to join their religion (Judaism) and leave Islam, after the Battle of Uhud, saying: (A party of the people of the Scripture long to make you go astray) from your Religion, Islam; (and they make none to go astray) from the religion of Allah (except themselves, but they perceive not) this; it is also said that this means: they perceive not that Allah informs His Prophet of this."
يٰأَهْلَ ٱلْكِتَابِ لِمَ تَكْفُرُونَ بِآيَاتِ ٱللَّهِ وَأَنْتُمْ تَشْهَدُونَ,"(O People of the Scripture! Why disbelieve you in the revelations of Allah) Muhammad and the Qur'an, (when you (yourselves) bear witness (to the Truth)?) you know from your Scripture that Muhammad is a prophet sent by Allah."
يٰأَهْلَ ٱلْكِتَابِ لِمَ تَلْبِسُونَ ٱلْحَقَّ بِٱلْبَاطِلِ وَتَكْتُمُونَ ٱلْحَقَّ وَأَنْتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ,(O People of the Scripture! Why confound ye truth with falsehood) you confound the traits of the anti-Christ with those of Muhammad (and knowingly conceal the Truth?) the traits and description of Muhammad which you find in your Scripture.
وَقَالَتْ طَّآئِفَةٌ مِّنْ أَهْلِ ٱلْكِتَابِ آمِنُواْ بِٱلَّذِيۤ أُنْزِلَ عَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَجْهَ ٱلنَّهَارِ وَٱكْفُرُوۤاْ آخِرَهُ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ,"Allah mentions then what Ka'b and his followers said about the change of the Qiblah, saying: (And a party of the People of the Scripture) Ka'b and his fellow leaders (say) to the lowly among people: (Believe in that which hath been revealed, unto those who believe) in Muhammad and the Qur'an (at the opening of the day) at the beginning of the Day, at the Dawn prayer, (and disbelieve at the end thereof) at the Zuhr prayer. In other words, they say: believe in the Qiblah towards which Muhammad and his Companions prayed at the Dawn prayer and disbelieve in the other Qiblah towards which they prayed at the Zuhr prayer, (in order that they may return) in order that their communality may return to your religion and Qiblah;"
وَلاَ تُؤْمِنُوۤاْ إِلاَّ لِمَن تَبِعَ دِينَكُمْ قُلْ إِنَّ ٱلْهُدَىٰ هُدَى ٱللَّهِ أَن يُؤْتَىۤ أَحَدٌ مِّثْلَ مَآ أُوتِيتُمْ أَوْ يُحَآجُّوكُمْ عِندَ رَبِّكُمْ قُلْ إِنَّ ٱلْفَضْلَ بِيَدِ ٱللَّهِ يُؤْتِيهِ مَن يَشَآءُ وَٱللَّهُ وَاسِعٌ عَلِيمٌ,"(And believe not) that he is a prophet (save in one who followeth your religion) Judaism, and your Qiblah, Jerusalem. (Say) to the Jews, O Muhammad: (Lo! the guidance is Allah's guidance) Allah's Religion is Islam and Allah's Qiblah is the Ka'bah, (that any one is given) of Religion and Qiblah (the like of that which was given unto you) O Companions of Muhammad (or that they may argue with you) that the Jews argue with you regarding this Religion and Qiblah (in the presence of their Lord) on the Day of Judgement. (Say) also, O Muhammad: (Lo! the bounty) prophethood, Islam and the Qiblah of Abraham (is in Allah's hand. He bestoweth it on whom He will) Muhammad and his Companions. (Allah is All- Embracing) in His bounty, (All-Knowing) to whom He gives."
يَخْتَصُّ بِرَحْمَتِهِ مَن يَشَآءُ وَاللَّهُ ذُو الْفَضْلِ الْعَظِيمِ,(He selecteth for His mercy) He chooses for His religion (whom He will) Muhammad and his Companions. (Allah is of Infinite Bounty) He is generous towards Muhammad by bestowing upon him prophethood and Islam.
وَمِنْ أَهْلِ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ مَنْ إِن تَأْمَنْهُ بِقِنْطَارٍ يُؤَدِّهِ إِلَيْكَ وَمِنْهُمْ مَّنْ إِن تَأْمَنْهُ بِدِينَارٍ لاَّ يُؤَدِّهِ إِلَيْكَ إِلاَّ مَا دُمْتَ عَلَيْهِ قَآئِماً ذٰلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ قَالُواْ لَيْسَ عَلَيْنَا فِي ٱلأُمِّيِّينَ سَبِيلٌ وَيَقُولُونَ عَلَى اللَّهِ ٱلْكَذِبَ وَهُمْ يَعْلَمُونَ,"Subsequently, Allah mentions the trustworthiness and treachery of the people of the Book, saying: (Among the People of the Scripture) i.e. the Jews (there is he who, if you trust him with a weight of treasure, will return it to you) without any problem, hardship or ever thinking to keep it for himself by declaring it lawful for him to take. The reference here is to 'Abdullah Ibn Salam and his companions. (And among them there is he who, if you trust him with a piece of gold, will not return it to you) and will declare it lawful for him to take (unless you keep standing over him) insisting on taking it back and suing him for it. The reference here is to Ka'b Ibn al-Ashraf and his followers. (That) treachery and declaring that it is lawful to take other people's property (is because they say: We have no duty to the Gentiles) there is no harm in taking the property of Arabs. (They speak a lie concerning Allah knowingly) they lie about Allah and know that they are lying."
بَلَىٰ مَنْ أَوْفَىٰ بِعَهْدِهِ وَاتَّقَى فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ يُحِبُّ الْمُتَّقِينَ,"(Nay) Allah is here answering them, (but (the chosen of Allah is) he who fulfileth his pledge) He says: but he who keeps his pledge between himself and his Lord or between himself and other people (and wardeth off (evil)) ward off breaking his pledge by treachery and turning on his pledge; (for lo! Allah loveth those who ward off (evil)) ward off breaking pledges, treachery and being untrustworthy."
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يَشْتَرُونَ بِعَهْدِ ٱللَّهِ وَأَيْمَانِهِمْ ثَمَناً قَلِيلاً أُوْلَـٰئِكَ لاَ خَلاَقَ لَهُمْ فِي ٱلآخِرَةِ وَلاَ يُكَلِّمُهُمُ ٱللَّهُ وَلاَ يَنظُرُ إِلَيْهِمْ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ وَلاَ يُزَكِّيهِمْ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,"Allah then mentioned their punishment, i.e. the punishment of the Jews, saying: (Lo! those who purchase a small gain) a small gain of in their living (at the cost of Allah's covenant) by breaking Allah's covenant (and their oaths) their pledges with their prophets, (they have no portion in the Hereafter) in Paradise. (Allah will neither speak to them) in a nice manner on the Day of Judgement (nor look upon them on the Day of Resurrection) He will have no mercy for them, (nor will He make them grow) He will neither exonerate them for being Jews nor put their minds at peace. (Theirs will be a painful doom) a severe pain which will spread to their hearts. It is also said that this was revealed about 'Abdan Ibn al-Ashu' and Imra' al-Qays because of a dispute between them, and it was also revealed about the Jews."
وَإِنَّ مِنْهُمْ لَفَرِيقاً يَلْوُونَ أَلْسِنَتَهُمْ بِٱلْكِتَابِ لِتَحْسَبُوهُ مِنَ ٱلْكِتَابِ وَمَا هُوَ مِنَ الْكِتَابِ وَيَقُولُونَ هُوَ مِنْ عِندِ اللَّهِ وَمَا هُوَ مِنْ عِندِ ٱللَّهِ وَيَقُولُونَ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ ٱلْكَذِبَ وَهُمْ يَعْلَمُونَ,"(And Lo! there is) of the Jews (a party of them) Ka'b and his fellow men (who distort the Scripture with their tongues) by reading the traits of the anti-Christ in their Scripture, (that ye may think) that the lowly may think (that what they say is from the Scripture, when it is not from the Scripture. And they say: It is from Allah) in the Torah, (when it is not from Allah) in the Torah; (and they speak a lie concerning Allah knowingly) fully aware that this is not in their Scripture."
مَا كَانَ لِبَشَرٍ أَن يُؤْتِيهُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ وَٱلْحُكْمَ وَٱلنُّبُوَّةَ ثُمَّ يَقُولَ لِلنَّاسِ كُونُواْ عِبَاداً لِّي مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ وَلَـٰكِن كُونُواْ رَبَّـٰنِيِّينَ بِمَا كُنتُمْ تُعَلِّمُونَ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ وَبِمَا كُنْتُمْ تَدْرُسُونَ,"Then Allah said as regards their claim that they follow the Religion of Abraham and that Abraham commanded them to follow this Religion: (It is not (possible) for any human being) among the prophets (unto whom Allah had given the Scripture and wisdom) understanding (and the prophethood that he should afterwards have said unto mankind: Be slaves of me instead of Allah; but (what he said was): Be you faithful servants of the Lord) men of knowledge, people of understanding as well as people who put what they learn into practice (by virtue of your constant teaching of the Scripture) from the Scripture; it is also said that this means: by virtue of your knowledge of the Scripture (and of your constant study thereof) of your reading from the Scripture."
وَلاَ يَأْمُرَكُمْ أَن تَتَّخِذُواْ ٱلْمَلاَئِكَةَ وَٱلنَّبِيِّيْنَ أَرْبَاباً أَيَأْمُرُكُم بِٱلْكُفْرِ بَعْدَ إِذْ أَنْتُمْ مُّسْلِمُونَ,"(And he commanded you) O people of the Quraysh, Jews and Christians (not that ye should take the angels) as daughters of Allah (and the Prophets for lords. Would he command you to disbelieve) how could Abraham command you to follow disbelief (after ye had surrendered (to Allah)) after he commanded you to follow Islam (completely Surrendering to Allah), saying to you: (Lo! Allah hath chosen for you the (true) Religion; therefore die not save as men who have surrendered [2:132]). Allah says here: Allah has not sent a Messenger except that He commanded him to follow Islam and not Judaism, Christianity or the worship of idols, as these unbelievers claim. It is also said that this verse was revealed about the claims of the Jews that Muhammad commanded them to love him and worship him as the Christians worshipped Jesus. The Christians and idolaters also made the same claim."
وَإِذْ أَخَذَ ٱللَّهُ مِيثَاقَ ٱلنَّبِيِّيْنَ لَمَآ آتَيْتُكُم مِّن كِتَابٍ وَحِكْمَةٍ ثُمَّ جَآءَكُمْ رَسُولٌ مُّصَدِّقٌ لِّمَا مَعَكُمْ لَتُؤْمِنُنَّ بِهِ وَلَتَنصُرُنَّهُ قَالَ أَأَقْرَرْتُمْ وَأَخَذْتُمْ عَلَىٰ ذٰلِكُمْ إِصْرِي قَالُوۤاْ أَقْرَرْنَا قَالَ فَٱشْهَدُواْ وَأَنَاْ مَعَكُمْ مِّنَ ٱلشَّاهِدِينَ,"Allah then explained His covenant with the prophets on the day of “Yes, indeed!” regarding Muhammad's traits and description, saying: (When Allah made (His) covenant with the Prophets) He says: Allah made a covenant with the prophets that they will show to one another the traits, description and merit of Muhammad, ((He said): Behold that which I have given ye) when I did give you (of the Scripture and knowledge) containing details of the lawful and the unlawful. (And) you also made a covenant with your nation that (afterward there will come unto you a messenger, confirming) by calling to Allah's divine Oneness (that which ye possess) of Scripture. (Ye shall believe in him) He says: you shall acknowledge him and his virtue (and ye shall help him) with the sword against his enemies and also by expositing his trait. (He said: Do ye agree?) Allah asked them whether they accepted (and will you take My burden) My covenant (in this) what I said? (They) the prophets (answered: We agree) we accept. (He) Allah (said: Then bear ye witness) of this. (I will be a witness with you) of this also. Allah thus made them witnesses of one another and He Himself is a witness. And so each prophet explained this to his nation, and each prophet made the members of his nation witnesses for each other, just as each prophet bore witness to it."
فَمَنْ تَوَلَّىٰ بَعْدَ ذٰلِكَ فَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْفَاسِقُونَ,(Then whosoever after this) the covenant (shall turn away) from among the nations: (they will be miscreants) who have broken the covenant and are unbelievers.
أَفَغَيْرَ دِينِ ٱللَّهِ يَبْغُونَ وَلَهُ أَسْلَمَ مَن فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ طَوْعاً وَكَرْهاً وَإِلَيْهِ يُرْجَعُونَ,"Allah then mentions the dispute of the Jews and Christians and the question which they put to the Prophet (pbuh) regarding who really follows the religion of Abraham. When the Prophet (pbuh) told them that they were both far from the Religion of Abraham, they said that they did not accept this judgement. Hence, Allah said: (Seek they) with you (other than the religion of Allah) Islam (complete surrender to Allah), (when unto Him submiteth) acknowledges Islam and Allah's divine Oneness (whosoever is in the heavens) of angels (and the earth) of believers, (willingly) the dwellers of the heavens willingly, (or unwillingly) the dwellers of the earth unwillingly. It is also said that this means: the sincere among the believers acknowledge this willingly while the hypocrites do so unwillingly; it is also said this means: those who are born Muslim acknowledge this willingly while those who were made to embrace Islam do so unwillingly, (and unto Him they will be returned) after death."
قُلْ آمَنَّا بِٱللَّهِ وَمَآ أُنزِلَ عَلَيْنَا وَمَآ أُنزِلَ عَلَىٰ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَإِسْمَاعِيلَ وَإِسْحَاقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ وَٱلأَسْبَاطِ وَمَا أُوتِيَ مُوسَىٰ وَعِيسَىٰ وَٱلنَّبِيُّونَ مِن رَّبِّهِمْ لاَ نُفَرِّقُ بَيْنَ أَحَدٍ مِّنْهُمْ وَنَحْنُ لَهُ مُسْلِمُونَ,"Allah then proceeds to explain the status of faith so that this serves for them as an indication to faith, saying: (Say) O Muhammad: (We believe in Allah) alone without any partner (and that which is revealed unto us) and in that which the Qur'an has revealed to us (and that which was revealed unto Abraham) and we believe in Abraham and his Scripture (and Ishmael) and his Scripture (and Isaac) and his Scripture (and Jacob) and his Scripture (and the tribes) the Children of Jacob and their scriptures, (and that which was vouchsafed unto Moses) and we believe in Moses and his Scripture (and Jesus) and his Scripture (and the Prophets) and we believe in all the prophets and their scriptures (from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them) we do not disbelieve in any of the prophets; it is also said this means: we do not disassociate any one of them from Allah in relation to prophethood and Islam, (and unto Him we have surrendered) we acknowledge His worship and divine Oneness and we are sincere to him in Religion."
وَمَن يَبْتَغِ غَيْرَ ٱلإِسْلاَمِ دِيناً فَلَنْ يُقْبَلَ مِنْهُ وَهُوَ فِي ٱلآخِرَةِ مِنَ ٱلْخَاسِرِينَ,"(And whoso seeketh as religion other than the Surrender (to Allah) it will not be accepted from him, and he will be a loser in the Hereafter) he will be among the duped because he will miss Paradise and all that is in it and dwell in hell with all that is in it."
كَيْفَ يَهْدِي ٱللَّهُ قَوْماً كَفَرُواْ بَعْدَ إِيمَانِهِمْ وَشَهِدُوۤاْ أَنَّ ٱلرَّسُولَ حَقٌّ وَجَآءَهُمُ ٱلْبَيِّنَاتُ وَٱللَّهُ لاَ يَهْدِي ٱلْقَوْمَ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ,(How shall Allah guide) to His religion (a people who disbelieved) in Allah (after their belief and (after) they bore witness that the messenger) Muhammad (is true and after clear proofs (of Allah's sovereignty)) the exposition of the Truth and the Book (had come unto them. And Allah guideth not wrong-doing folk) the idolaters and those who are not fit for His religion.
أُوْلَـٰئِكَ جَزَآؤُهُمْ أَنَّ عَلَيْهِمْ لَعْنَةَ ٱللَّهِ وَٱلْمَلاۤئِكَةِ وَٱلنَّاسِ أَجْمَعِينَ,"(As for such, their reward is that on them rests the curse of Allah) the punishment of Allah (and of angels) and the curse of the angels (and of men combined) and the curse of the believers."
خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا لاَ يُخَفَّفُ عَنْهُمُ ٱلْعَذَابُ وَلاَ هُمْ يُنظَرُونَ,"(They will abide therein) in the curse. (Their doom will not be lightened, neither will they be reprieved) their punishment will not be deferred;"
إِلاَّ ٱلَّذِينَ تَابُواْ مِن بَعْدِ ذٰلِكَ وَأَصْلَحُواْ فَإِنَّ الله غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"(Save those who afterward) after their apostasy (repent) from disbelief and hypocrisy (and do right) sincerely declare Allah's divine Oneness. (Lo! Allah is Forgiving) of those who repent among them, (Merciful) towards those who die in a state of repentance."
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ بَعْدَ إِيمَانِهِمْ ثُمَّ ٱزْدَادُواْ كُفْراً لَّن تُقْبَلَ تَوْبَتُهُمْ وَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلضَّآلُّونَ,"(Lo! those who disbelieve) in Allah (after their (profession of) belief) in Allah, (and afterward grow violent in disbelief) do not waver in their disbelief: (their repentance will not be accepted) as long as they remain in that state. (And such are those who are astray) from guidance and Islam."
إِنَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَمَاتُواْ وَهُمْ كُفَّارٌ فَلَن يُقْبَلَ مِنْ أَحَدِهِم مِّلْءُ ٱلأَرْضِ ذَهَباً وَلَوِ ٱفْتَدَىٰ بِهِ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ وَمَا لَهُمْ مِّن نَّاصِرِينَ,"(Lo! Those who disbelieve) in Allah and His Messenger, (and die in disbelief) disbelieving in Allah and His Messenger, (the (whole) earth) the weight of the earth (full of gold would not be accepted from such an one if it were offered as a ransom). Allah says: If they were to give the equivalent of the earth's weight in gold to ransom themselves, it would not be accepted from them. (Theirs will be a painful doom) which will extend to their hearts (and they will have no helpers) anyone to save them from Allah's punishment. The verses from (Lo! those who disbelieve after their (profession of) belief…. Theirs will be a painful doom and they will have no helpers) were revealed about ten hypocrites, namely, Tu'mah and his companions, who left Medina to Mecca as apostates from their religion, Islam. Some of them died as apostates, some were killed while some later returned to the fold of Islam."
لَن تَنَالُواْ ٱلْبِرَّ حَتَّىٰ تُنْفِقُواْ مِمَّا تُحِبُّونَ وَمَا تُنْفِقُواْ مِن شَيْءٍ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ بِهِ عَلِيمٌ,"Allah then prompted the believers to spend in the cause of Allah, saying: (Ye will not attain unto piety) i.e. that which is with Allah of reward, honour and Paradise until you spend of that which you love of property; it is also said this means: you shall not attend to reliance in Allah and God-fearingness (until ye spend of that which ye love. And whatsoever ye spend) of property, (Allah is aware thereof) just as He is aware of your intentions, i.e. whether you intend with it His Countenance or other people's praise."
كُلُّ ٱلطَّعَامِ كَانَ حِـلاًّ لِّبَنِيۤ إِسْرَائِيلَ إِلاَّ مَا حَرَّمَ إِسْرَائِيلُ عَلَىٰ نَفْسِهِ مِن قَبْلِ أَن تُنَزَّلَ ٱلتَّوْرَاةُ قُلْ فَأْتُواْ بِٱلتَّوْرَاةِ فَٱتْلُوهَا إِن كُنتُمْ صَادِقِينَ,"(All food was lawful unto the Children of Israel) all food that is lawful for Muhammad and his community today was lawful for the Children of Israel, the sons of Jacob, (save that which Israel) Jacob (forbade himself) by the way of vows, ((in days) before the Torah was revealed) before the revelation of the Torah to Moses, Jacob forbade himself the meat and milk of camels. When this verse was revealed, the Prophet (pbuh) asked the Jews: “What did Jacob forbid himself of food?” They said: “he did not forbid himself any type of food, and whatever is forbidden for us today, such as the meat of camels and other things, was already forbidden on all prophets, from Adam to Moses (pbut). It is only you who make such things lawful”. And they claimed those things were also forbidden in the Torah. Hence Allah said to Muhammad (pbuh): (Say) to them: (Produce the Torah and read it (unto us)) where they are made forbidden (if ye are truthful) in your claim. But they failed to produce the Torah and knew they were liars since there was nothing in the Torah to substantiate their claim."
فَمَنِ ٱفْتَرَىٰ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ ٱلْكَذِبَ مِن بَعْدِ ذَلِكَ فَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلظَّالِمُونَ,"Therefore Allah said: (And whoever shall invent a falsehood after that) after the exposition in the Torah show them to be liars (concerning Allah, such will be wrong-doers) unbelievers who lie about Allah."
قُلْ صَدَقَ ٱللَّهُ فَٱتَّبِعُواْ مِلَّةَ إِبْرَاهِيمَ حَنِيفاً وَمَا كَانَ مِنَ ٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ,"(Say) O Muhammad: (Allah speaketh truth) when He said Abraham was neither a Jew nor a Christian; it is also said this means: Say, O Muhammad, Allah has said the Truth regarding what He stated concerning that which is lawful and that which is unlawful. (So follow the religion of Abraham, the upright) i.e. the Muslim. (He was not of the idolaters) who followed their Religion."
إِنَّ أَوَّلَ بَيْتٍ وُضِعَ لِلنَّاسِ لَلَّذِي بِبَكَّةَ مُبَارَكاً وَهُدًى لِّلْعَالَمِينَ,"(Lo! the first Sanctuary) mosque (appointed for mankind) for the believers (was that at Becca) where the Ka'bah is, (a blessed place) that the spot where the Ka'bah is built contains forgiveness and mercy, (a guidance to the peoples) it is a Qiblah to every prophet, messenger, veracious one (siddiq) and believer;"
فِيهِ ءَايَٰتٌ بَيِّنَـٰتٌ مَّقَامُ إِبْرَٰهِيمَ وَمَن دَخَلَهُ كَانَ آمِناً وَللَّهِ عَلَى ٱلنَّاسِ حِجُّ ٱلْبَيْتِ مَنِ ٱسْتَطَاعَ إِلَيْهِ سَبِيلاً وَمَن كَفَرَ فَإِنَّ ٱلله غَنِيٌّ عَنِ ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ,"(Wherein are plain memorials) clear signs; and it contains (the place where Abraham stood up to pray) as well as the semi-circular wall of white marble (Hatim) of Ishmael and the black stone; (and whosoever entereth it is safe) from violence. (And to the House) going to the House (is a duty unto Allah for mankind) for the believers, (for him who can find a way thither) for the person who can walk and reach the House while at the same time being in possession of provisions, a mount and has left enough expenditure for his dependents until he returns. (As for him who disbelieveth) in Allah, Muhammad, the Qur'an and the obligation of pilgrimage, (Lo! Allah is Independent of (all) creatures) He is not in need of their belief or pilgrimage."
قُلْ يٰأَهْلَ ٱلْكِتَابِ لِمَ تَكْفُرُونَ بِآيَاتِ ٱللَّهِ وَٱللَّهُ شَهِيدٌ عَلَى مَا تَعْمَلُونَ,"(Say: O People of the Scripture! Why disbelieve ye in the revelations of Allah) i.e. in Muhammad and the Qur'an, (when Allah (Himself) is Witness of what ye do) of disbelief, by concealing [the Truth] and engaging in sins?"
قُلْ يٰأَهْلَ ٱلْكِتَابِ لِمَ تَصُدُّونَ عَن سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ مَنْ آمَنَ تَبْغُونَهَا عِوَجاً وَأَنْتُمْ شُهَدَآءُ وَمَا ٱللَّهُ بِغَافِلٍ عَمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ,"(Say: O People of the Scripture! Why drive ye back believers) in Allah, Muhammad and the Qur'an (from the way of Allah) from the Religion of Allah and His worship, (seeking to make it crooked, when you are witnesses?) when you know it to be in the Scripture. (Allah is not unaware of what ye do) Allah is not oblivious to your disbelief: concealing the Truth and committing transgressions. This verse was revealed about those who invited 'Ammar [Ibn Yasir] and his fellow Muslims to join their religion: Judaism."
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُوۤاْ إِن تُطِيعُواْ فَرِيقاً مِّنَ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ ٱلْكِتَابَ يَرُدُّوكُم بَعْدَ إِيمَانِكُمْ كَافِرِينَ,(O ye who believe! If ye obey a party of those who have received the Scripture) the Torah (they will make you disbelievers) in Allah and Muhammad (after your belief) in Allah and [the message of] Muhammad.
وَكَيْفَ تَكْفُرُونَ وَأَنْتُمْ تُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْكُمْ آيَاتُ ٱللَّهِ وَفِيكُمْ رَسُولُهُ وَمَن يَعْتَصِم بِٱللَّهِ فَقَدْ هُدِيَ إِلَىٰ صِرَاطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ,"(How can ye disbelieve) in Allah. This is mentioned by way of amazement, (when it is ye unto whom Allah's revelations) the Qur'an containing commands and prohibitions (are recited, and His messenger) Muhammad (is in your midst?) with you. (He who holdeth fast to Allah) he who adheres to Allah's Religion and His Book, (he indeed is guided unto a right path) he is directed along a clear, solid way, which is Islam; it is also said this means: he has become firm on this way. This verse was revealed about Mu'adh [Ibn Jabal] and his companions."
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ ٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ حَقَّ تُقَاتِهِ وَلاَ تَمُوتُنَّ إِلاَّ وَأَنْتُمْ مُّسْلِمُونَ,"Thereafter, Allah spoke about a dispute between the Aws and the Khazraj, in which Tha'labah Ibn Ghanam and As'ad Ibn Zurarah boasted about their killings and raids on their rivals in the pre-Islamic days, saying: (O ye who believe! Observe your duty to Allah) obey Allah (with right observance) such that one obeys Him and never contravenes against Him, thank Him and never be ungrateful to him, remember Him and never forget Him; it is also said this means: obey Allah as He ought to be obeyed, (and die not save as those who have surrendered (unto Him)) sincerely acknowledging that you worship Him and declare His divine Oneness;"

(And remember Allah's favour unto you) by giving you Islam: (how ye were enemies) before Islam (and He made friendship between your hearts) through Islam (so that ye became as brothers by His grace) by His religion, Islam; (and (how) ye were upon the brink of an abyss of fire) i.e. because of disbelief, (and He did save you from it) by means of faith. (Thus Allah maketh clear His revelations) His commands, prohibitions and favours (unto you, that haply ye may be guided) from error."
وَلْتَكُن مِّنْكُمْ أُمَّةٌ يَدْعُونَ إِلَى ٱلْخَيْرِ وَيَأْمُرُونَ بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ وَيَنْهَوْنَ عَنِ ٱلْمُنْكَرِ وَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْمُفْلِحُونَ,"Allah then commanded goodness and reconciliation, saying: (And there may spring from you) there still exists among you (a nation) a group (who invite to goodness) who invite to reconciliation and excellence, (and enjoin right conduct) they enjoin Allah's divine Oneness and the following of Muhammad (pbuh) (and forbid indecency) they forbid disbelief, idolatry and rejection, instead following the Messenger. (Such are they who are successful) who are saved from Allah's wrath and punishment."

For such) i.e. the Jews and Christians (there is an awful doom) greater than anything one can imagine."

(Then taste the punishment for that ye disbelieved) in Allah.

Allah then showed how they were the best community that has been raised for mankind saying: (Ye enjoin right conduct) you enjoin the divine Oneness of Allah and the following of Muhammad (and forbid indecency) you forbid disbelief, idolatry and the opposition of the Messenger; (and ye believe in Allah) as well as in all revealed scriptures and messengers. (And if the People of the Scripture) i.e. the Jews and Christians (had believed it had been better for them) than what they are in now.

(They have incurred anger) they deserved anger (from their Lord, and wretchedness is laid upon them) the attire of poverty was imposed upon them. (That) ignominy (is because they used to disbelieve the revelations of Allah) in Muhammad and the Qur'an, (and slew the Prophets wrongfully) i.e. without the prophets having committed any crime. (That) anger and humiliation (is because they were rebellious) against Allah on the Sabbath (and used to transgress) by killing the prophets and take as lawful things that were prohibited."
لَيْسُواْ سَوَآءً مِّنْ أَهْلِ ٱلْكِتَابِ أُمَّةٌ قَآئِمَةٌ يَتْلُونَ آيَاتِ ٱللَّهِ آنَآءَ ٱللَّيْلِ وَهُمْ يَسْجُدُونَ,"(They are not all alike) i.e. those who believed from among the people of the Book are not like those among them who have not.

(They are of the righteous) of the righteous among the community of Muhammad in Paradise, such as Abu Bakr and his fellow believers."

(Allah is Aware of those who ward off (evil)) ward off disbelief, idolatry and indecency-the reference here being to 'Abdullah Ibn Salam and his followers."

(Allah wronged them not) by thwarting the benefit of their harvest and spending, (but they did wrong themselves) through disbelief and withholding what is due to Allah from the harvest."
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ لاَ تَتَّخِذُواْ بِطَانَةً مِّن دُونِكُمْ لاَ يَأْلُونَكُمْ خَبَالاً وَدُّواْ مَا عَنِتُّمْ قَدْ بَدَتِ ٱلْبَغْضَآءُ مِنْ أَفْوَاهِهِمْ وَمَا تُخْفِي صُدُورُهُمْ أَكْبَرُ قَدْ بَيَّنَّا لَكُمُ الآيَاتِ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ,"Allah then forbade the believers from among the Helpers to speak with the Jews or divulge secrets to them, saying: (O ye who believe! Take not) the Jews (for intimates) confidants (others than your own folk) the sincere believers, (who would spare no pains to ruin you; they love to hamper you) they love for you to sin and become idolaters as they themselves have become. (Hatred is revealed by (the utterance of) their mouths) through vilification and defamation, (but that which their breasts hide is greater) but what they hide in their hearts of hatred and enmity is even greater. (We have made plain for you the revelations) the signs of their resentful envy (if you will understand) what is recited to you; it is also said that this means: We have made the revelations, i.e. the commands and prohibitions, clear so that you know what I command you."
هَآأَنْتُمْ أُوْلاۤءِ تُحِبُّونَهُمْ وَلاَ يُحِبُّونَكُمْ وَتُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱلْكِتَابِ كُلِّهِ وَإِذَا لَقُوكُمْ قَالُوۤاْ آمَنَّا وَإِذَا خَلَوْاْ عَضُّواْ عَلَيْكُمُ ٱلأَنَامِلَ مِنَ ٱلْغَيْظِ قُلْ مُوتُواْ بِغَيْظِكُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلِيمٌ بِذَاتِ ٱلصُّدُورِ,"(Lo!

(When they) the hypocrites among the Jews (fall in with you they say: We believe) in Muhammad and the Qur'an and we acknowledge that his traits and description are in our Scripture; (but when they go apart) and meet with each other (they bite their finger tips at you, for rage.

إِذْ هَمَّتْ طَّآئِفَتَانِ مِنكُمْ أَن تَفْشَلاَ وَٱللَّهُ وَلِيُّهُمَا وَعَلَى ٱللَّهِ فَلْيَتَوَكَّلِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ,"(When two parties of you almost) two tribes of believers, the Banu Salamah and Banu Harithah, hid the fact that they almost (fell away) shrank away from fighting against the enemy on the Day of Uhud, (and Allah was their Protecting Friend) He preserved them and prevented them from doing so. (In Allah do believers put their trust) the believers ought to put their trust in Allah when it comes to help and conquest."
وَلَقَدْ نَصَرَكُمُ ٱللَّهُ بِبَدْرٍ وَأَنْتُمْ أَذِلَّةٌ فَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ,"(Allah had already given you the victory at Badr) on the day of the Battle of Badr, (when ye were contemptible) few in number: 313 men.

لَيْسَ لَكَ مِنَ ٱلأَمْرِ شَيْءٌ أَوْ يَتُوبَ عَلَيْهِمْ أَوْ يُعَذِّبَهُمْ فَإِنَّهُمْ ظَالِمُونَ,"(It is no concern at all of thee (Muhammad)) repentance and punishment are not in your hands whereby you pray against those who were defeated on the Day of Uhud, the archers and others (whether He relent towards them) He says: if Allah chooses to relent towards them and forgive them (or punish them) because of their leaving their positions; (for they are evil-doers) for leaving their positions. It is also said that this was revealed about two tribes, the 'Asabah and Dhakwan, against whom the Prophet (pbuh) prayed when they killed some of his Companions."

(Therefore He rewarded you grief for (his) grief) in addition to the grief wrought upon you by Khalid Ibn al-Walid, He also inflicted on you the grief of death and defeat, (that (He might teach) you not to sorrow either for that which ye missed) of booty (or for that which befell you) and that you do not sorrow for that which befell you of deaths and injuries. (Allah is Informed of what ye do) in jihad as well as in defeat."
ثُمَّ أَنزَلَ عَلَيْكُمْ مِّن بَعْدِ ٱلْغَمِّ أَمَنَةً نُّعَاساً يَغْشَىٰ طَآئِفَةً مِّنْكُمْ وَطَآئِفَةٌ قَدْ أَهَمَّتْهُمْ أَنْفُسُهُمْ يَظُنُّونَ بِٱللَّهِ غَيْرَ ٱلْحَقِّ ظَنَّ ٱلْجَٰهِلِيَّةِ يَقُولُونَ هَل لَّنَا مِنَ ٱلأَمْرِ مِن شَيْءٍ قُلْ إِنَّ ٱلأَمْرَ كُلَّهُ للَّهِ يُخْفُونَ فِيۤ أَنْفُسِهِم مَّا لاَ يُبْدُونَ لَكَ يَقُولُونَ لَوْ كَانَ لَنَا مِنَ ٱلأَمْرِ شَيْءٌ مَّا قُتِلْنَا هَٰهُنَا قُل لَّوْ كُنتُمْ فِي بُيُوتِكُمْ لَبَرَزَ ٱلَّذِينَ كُتِبَ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلْقَتْلُ إِلَىٰ مَضَاجِعِهِمْ وَلِيَبْتَلِيَ ٱللَّهُ مَا فِي صُدُورِكُمْ وَلِيُمَحِّصَ مَا فِي قُلُوبِكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ بِذَاتِ ٱلصُّدُورِ,"Allah then mentioned His blessings upon them, saying: (Then, after grief, He sent down security for you) from the enemy. (As slumber did it overcome a party of you) such that those among you who had sincerity and certitude slept, (while (the other) party, who were anxious on their own account) who were overcome with anxiousness about themselves. This refers to Mu'attib Ibn Qushayr, the hypocrite, and his fellows who were not overcome by sleep, (thought wrongly of Allah) that He would not come to the help of His Messenger and his Companions, (the thought of ignorance) as they did think of Him in the time of ignorance [before the advent of Islam]. (They said: Have we any part in the cause) any part in triumph and domination? (Say) O Muhammad: (The cause) triumph and domination (belongeth wholly to Allah) they are in the Hand of Allah. (They hide within themselves (a thought) which they reveal not unto you) for fear that they would be killed, (saying: Had we had any part in the cause we should not have been slain here. Say) to the hypocrites, O Muhammad: (Even though ye had been in your houses) in Medina, (those appointed to be slain would have gone forth to the places where they were to lie) where they were to be killed at Uhud. ((All this has been) in order that Allah might try) test (what is in your breasts) what is in the breast of the hypocrites (and prove) bring to the fore (what is in your hearts) of hypocrisy. (Allah is Aware of what is hidden in the breasts (of men)) He knows what is in people's hearts of good and evil, i.e. the hearts of hypocrites; it is also said that it refers to the hearts of the archers."
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ تَوَلَّوْاْ مِنكُمْ يَوْمَ ٱلْتَقَى ٱلْجَمْعَانِ إِنَّمَا ٱسْتَزَلَّهُمُ ٱلشَّيْطَانُ بِبَعْضِ مَا كَسَبُواْ وَلَقَدْ عَفَا ٱللَّهُ عَنْهُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ حَلِيمٌ,"Allah then mentioned those who fled on the Day of Uhud, saying (Lo! those of you who turned back) defeated, meaning: 'Uthman Ibn 'Affan and his fellow believers (on the day when the two hosts) the hosts of Muhammad and Abu Sufyan (met, Satan alone it was who caused them to backslide) Satan enticed them to believe that Muhammad was killed and thus fled to a place about six parasangs (farasikh) from the scene. They were six people in all, (because of some of that which they have earned) because of leaving their positions. (Now Allah hath forgiven them) since He did not exterminate them. (Lo! Allah is Forgiving) of those who repented among them. (Clement) for He did not hasten their punishment."
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ لاَ تَكُونُواْ كَٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَقَالُواْ لإِخْوَانِهِمْ إِذَا ضَرَبُواْ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ أَوْ كَانُواْ غُزًّى لَّوْ كَانُواْ عِنْدَنَا مَا مَاتُواْ وَمَا قُتِلُواْ لِيَجْعَلَ ٱللَّهُ ذٰلِكَ حَسْرَةً فِي قُلُوبِهِمْ وَٱللَّهُ يُحْيِـي وَيُمِيتُ وَٱللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ,"Then Allah said to the Companions of Muhammad: (O ye who believe!) in Muhammad and the Qur'an. (Be not) in war (as those who disbelieved) in secret, i.e. 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy and his followers who returned to Medina (and said of their brethren) the hypocrites (who went abroad in the land) who journeyed with the Companions of Muhammad (or were fighting in the field) or went with their Prophet in a fighting expedition: (If they had been (here) with us) in Medina (they would not have died) on their journey (or been killed) during the fighting expedition; (that Allah may make it) make that doubt (anguish) grief (in their hearts. Allah giveth life) on the journey (and causeth death) settlement; (and Allah is Seer of what ye do) of what you say."
وَلَئِنْ قُتِلْتُمْ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ أَوْ مُتُّمْ لَمَغْفِرَةٌ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَرَحْمَةٌ خَيْرٌ مِّمَّا يَجْمَعُونَ,(And what though ye be slain in Allah's way) O group of hypocrites (or die therein?) in your own homes while being sincere. (Surely pardon from Allah) of your sins (and mercy) by being spared punishment (are better than all that they amass) in this world of wealth.
وَلَئِنْ مُّتُّمْ أَوْ قُتِلْتُمْ لإِلَى ٱلله تُحْشَرُونَ,"(What though ye be slain) on a journey or in settlement (or die) in a fighting expedition, (when unto Allah you are gathered?) after you die."

So pardon them) pardon your Companions for that which may ensue from them (and ask forgiveness for them) from that transgression which ensues from them (and consult with them upon the conduct of affairs) in matter of war. (And when thou art resolved) to do something, (then put your trust in Allah) to give you triumph and domination. (Lo! Allah loveth those who put their trust) in Him."

وَمَا كَانَ لِنَبِيٍّ أَنْ يَغُلَّ وَمَن يَغْلُلْ يَأْتِ بِمَا غَلَّ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ ثُمَّ تُوَفَّىٰ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ مَّا كَسَبَتْ وَهُمْ لاَ يُظْلَمُونَ,"Then Allah mentioned their surmise about the Prophet (pbuh) that he was not going to divide any of the booty among them, and because of this they left their positions, saying: (It is not for any Prophet) it is not permissible for any prophet (to deceive) to cheat his community regarding booty; it is also possible that the meaning is: it is not permissible for a community to deceive its prophet. (Whoso deceiveth) as regards any of the booty (will bring his deceit with him) carried on his neck (on the Day of Resurrection. Then every soul will be paid in full what it hath earned) that which it has deceived and also other things; (and they will not be wronged) their good works will not be diminished and their evil deeds will not be increased."

أَوَلَمَّآ أَصَـٰبَتْكُمْ مُّصِيبَةٌ قَدْ أَصَبْتُمْ مِّثْلَيْهَا قُلْتُمْ أَنَّىٰ هَـٰذَا قُلْ هُوَ مِنْ عِندِ أَنْفُسِكُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,"He then mentioned their misfortune on the Day of Uhud, saying: (And was it so, when a disaster smote you) on the Day of Uhud, (though you had smitten (them with a disaster) twice (as great)) as you inflicted on the people of Mecca, on the Day of Badr, a disaster twice that inflicted on you on the Day of Uhud, (that ye said: How is this?) how can this befall us when we are Muslims. (Say) O Muhammad: (It is from yourselves) it is due to the transgression you committed yourselves when you left your positions. (Lo! Allah is Able to do all things) whether it is punishment or something else."
وَمَآ أَصَابَكُمْ يَوْمَ ٱلْتَقَى ٱلْجَمْعَانِ فَبِإِذْنِ ٱللَّهِ وَلِيَعْلَمَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,"(That which befell you) of deaths and injuries, (on the day when the two armies) the army of Muhammad and that of Abu Sufyan (met, was by permission of Allah) by His will and decree; (that He might know the true believers) that He might see the believers in jihad;"

(They answered: If we knew) there was (aught of fighting we would follow you) to Uhud. (On that day they were nearer disbelief than faith) or the believers; it is also said that this means: their return to disbelief and the disbelievers was closer than their return to faith and the believers. (They utter with their mouths a thing which is not in their hearts) to corroborate it. (Allah is best aware of what they hide) of disbelief and hypocrisy."

(But) this only (increased the faith of them) emboldened them even more (and they cried: Allah is sufficient for us!) Allah is sufficient to give victory. (Most Excellent is He in Whom we trust!) our trust is in Allah."
فَٱنْقَلَبُواْ بِنِعْمَةٍ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَفَضْلٍ لَّمْ يَمْسَسْهُمْ سُوۤءٌ وَٱتَّبَعُواْ رِضْوَانَ ٱللَّهِ وَٱللَّهُ ذُو فَضْلٍ عَظِيمٍ,"(So they returned with grace) reward (and favour from Allah,) and profit from that which they traded in the market place; it is also said that this means: booty (and no harm) fighting or defeat (touched them) in going and returning. (They followed the good pleasure of Allah) by accompanying the Prophet (pbuh) at the lesser Badr, (and Allah) by driving the enemy from them (is of Infinite Bounty) favour."
إِنَّمَا ذٰلِكُمُ ٱلشَّيْطَـٰنُ يُخَوِّفُ أَوْلِيَاءَهُ فَلاَ تَخَافُوهُمْ وَخَافُونِ إِن كُنتُمْ مُّؤْمِنِينَ,"(It is only the devil) the one who was scaring you with ways of the devil, i.e. Nu'aym Ibn Mas'ud. Allah called him a devil because he was a follower of Satan and his whisperings (who would make (men) fear his partisans) He says: he makes you fear his partisans: the unbelievers.

Show us, O Muhammad, who believes among us and who does not”, Allah then said: (It is not (the purpose) of Allah to leave the believers) and unbelievers (in your present state) of religion until the believer becomes an unbeliever and the unbeliever becomes a believer if it is so in His decree (till He shall separate the wicked from the good) the damned from the felicitous, the unbeliever from the believer and the hypocrite from the sincere. (And it is not (the purpose of) Allah to let you know) O people of Mecca (the unseen) such that you know who believes and who does not. (But Allah chooseth) selects (of His messengers whom He will) i.e. Muhammad, and informs him of some of the unseen through revelation. (So believe in Allah and His messengers) believe in all the messengers and Scriptures. (If ye believe) in Allah and all the Scriptures and messengers (and ward off (evil)) ward off disbelief and idolatry, (yours will be a vast reward) an abundant reward in Paradise."

Nay, it is worse for them. That which they hoard) of wealth, i.e. gold and silver (will be their collar on the Day of Resurrection) will be used as a collar of fire around their necks. (Allah's is the heritage of the heavens and the earth) the stores of the heavens and earth, i.e. rain and vegetation, are Allah's; it is also said that this means: the dwellers of the heavens and earth will die and dominion shall be for Allah, the One, the Conqueror, (and Allah is Informed of what ye do) of acts of generosity or miserliness."

Allah is poor: He is asking us to give Him a loan”, saying (Verily Allah heard the saying of those) Finhas Ibn 'Azura' and his fellows (who said, (when asked for contributions to the war): “Allah, forsooth, is poor) He needs us to give Him a loan, (and we are rich!”) and we do not need a loan from Him. (We shall record their saying) We shall preserve for them what they have said in the Hereafter (with their slaying of the Prophets) just as We shall record for them their slaying of the prophets (wrongfully) without them having committed any crime (and We shall say: Taste ye the punishment of burning!) which is very severe."

Allah hath charged us) Allah has commanded us in the Scripture (that we believe not in any messenger) we will not accept that anyone is sent with a message (until he bring us an offering which fire (from heaven) shall devour) that is until Allah sends a fire which will devour this offering, as it happened in the time of the [Jewish] prophets. (Say) O Muhammad: (Messengers came unto you before me with miracles) with commands and prohibitions as well as signs, (and with that (very miracle) which ye describe) of an offering [devoured by fire], Zachariah, John and Jesus. (Why then did ye slay them?) why did you kill John and Zachariah, when such an offering [devoured by fire] took place during their time. ((Answer that) if ye are truthful) in your claim."
فَإِن كَذَّبُوكَ فَقَدْ كُذِّبَ رُسُلٌ مِّن قَبْلِكَ جَآءُوا بِٱلْبَيِّنَاتِ وَٱلزُّبُرِ وَٱلْكِتَابِ ٱلْمُنِيرِ,"When they replied that their fathers never killed any prophet wrongfully, Allah said: (And if they deny thee) O Muhammad regarding what you say to them, do not be saddened, (even so did they deny messengers who were before you) their people denied them, (who came with miracles) with commands and prohibitions and signs of prophethood (and with the Psalms) and with the news relating to the Scriptures of past nations (and with the Scripture giving light) showing the lawful and the prohibited."
كُلُّ نَفْسٍ ذَآئِقَةُ ٱلْمَوْتِ وَإِنَّمَا تُوَفَّوْنَ أُجُورَكُمْ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ فَمَن زُحْزِحَ عَنِ ٱلنَّارِ وَأُدْخِلَ ٱلْجَنَّةَ فَقَدْ فَازَ وَما ٱلْحَيَاةُ ٱلدُّنْيَا إِلاَّ مَتَاعُ ٱلْغُرُورِ,"Allah then mentioned their deaths and what happens after their deaths, saying: (Every soul) that breathes (will taste of death. And ye will be paid on the Day of Resurrection only that which ye have fairly earned) the reward of your works. (Whoso is removed from the Fire) by means of declaring Allah's divine Oneness and doing righteous works (and is made to enter Paradise, he indeed is triumphant) in that he gains Paradise and that which it contains, and is further saved from hell and that which it contains. (The life of this world is but comfort of illusion) which is comparable to the relative duration of the stuff one has at home such as pottery, bottles, and the like."
لَتُبْلَوُنَّ فِيۤ أَمْوَالِكُمْ وَأَنْفُسِكُمْ وَلَتَسْمَعُنَّ مِنَ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ ٱلْكِتَابَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ وَمِنَ ٱلَّذِينَ أَشْرَكُوۤاْ أَذًى كَثِيراً وَإِن تَصْبِرُواْ وَتَتَّقُواْ فَإِنَّ ذٰلِكَ مِنْ عَزْمِ ٱلأُمُورِ,"Allah then mentioned the harm that the unbelievers inflicted on the Prophet and his Companions, saying: (Assuredly ye will be tried) you will be tested (in your property) by the loss of your property (and in your persons) and in what befalls your persons of sicknesses, pain, killings, beatings and general misfortunes, (and ye will hear much wrong from those who were given the Scripture before you) i.e. the Jews and Christians: you will hear vilification, defamation, lies and false testimony against Allah, (and from the idolaters) i.e. the Arab idolaters. (But if ye persevere) in the face of their harm (and ward off (evil)) and ward off transgressing against Allah while facing such harm, (then that) steadfastness and endurance (is of the steadfast heart of things) is the best of things and the most firm for believers."
وَإِذْ أَخَذَ ٱللَّهُ مِيثَاقَ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ ٱلْكِتَابَ لَتُبَيِّنُنَّهُ لِلنَّاسِ وَلاَ تَكْتُمُونَهُ فَنَبَذُوهُ وَرَآءَ ظُهُورِهِمْ وَٱشْتَرَوْاْ بِهِ ثَمَناً قَلِيلاً فَبِئْسَ مَا يَشْتَرُونَ,"Then Allah mentioned His covenant with the people of the Book in the Scripture, which required them to exposit the traits and description of His Prophet, saying: (And (remember) when Allah laid a charge on those who had received the Scripture) i.e. the Torah and the Gospel ((He said): Ye are to expound it) the trait and description of Muhammad (to mankind and not to hide it) not to hide these traits and description of Muhammad in their Scripture. (But they flung it behind their backs) and did not act upon it (and bought thereby a little gain) a paltry acquisition in their means of living by hiding the traits and description of Muhammad in their Scripture. (Verily evil is that which they have gained thereby) evil is that which they have chosen for themselves: Judaism and the concealment of the traits and description of Muhammad."
لاَ تَحْسَبَنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يَفْرَحُونَ بِمَآ أَتَوْاْ وَّيُحِبُّونَ أَن يُحْمَدُواْ بِمَا لَمْ يَفْعَلُواْ فَلاَ تَحْسَبَنَّهُمْ بِمَفَازَةٍ مِّنَ ٱلْعَذَابِ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,"Allah then mentioned their longing for praise and credit for that which they-the Jews-did not have, saying: (Think not) suppose not, O Muhammad (that those who exult in what they have given) whereby they changed the traits and description of Muhammad in their Scripture, (and love to be praised for what they have not done) they like that people say they have good in them when they do not. They like that people say that they are follower of the Religion of Abraham and that they are good to the poor. (Think not) O Muhammad, (they are in safety from the doom. A painful doom is theirs) a severe torment shall be theirs."
وَللَّهِ مُلْكُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,(Unto Allah belongeth the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth) to Allah belong the stores of the heavens (rain) and the earth (vegetation). (Allah is Able to do all things) in relation to the dwellers of the heavens and the earth and to their stores.
إِنَّ فِي خَلْقِ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَٱخْتِلاَفِ ٱلَّيلِ وَٱلنَّهَارِ لآيَاتٍ لأُوْلِي ٱلأَلْبَابِ,"Allah then exposited on the sign of His ability to the unbelievers of Mecca when they said: "" O Muhammad, bring us a clear sign to prove what you are saying "" , saying: (Lo! In the creation of the heavens) in that which We created in the heavens of angels, the sun, moon, stars and clouds (and the earth) and in the creation of the earth and what is in it of mountains, seas, trees and beasts (and (in) the difference of night and day) and in the alternation of day and night (are tokens (of His sovereignty)) signs of His divine Oneness (for men of understanding) for those among them who have reasons,"
ٱلَّذِينَ يَذْكُرُونَ ٱللَّهَ قِيَاماً وَقُعُوداً وَعَلَىٰ جُنُوبِهِمْ وَيَتَفَكَّرُونَ فِي خَلْقِ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ رَبَّنَآ مَا خَلَقْتَ هَذا بَاطِلاً سُبْحَانَكَ فَقِنَا عَذَابَ النَّارِ,"(Such as remember Allah) pray to Allah, (standing) when they are able to, (sitting) when they cannot stand, (and reclining) when they can neither stand nor sit, (and consider) the marvellous things which are contained in (the creation of the heavens and the earth, (and say): Our Lord) they say: O our Lord! (Thou createdst not this in vain) for nothing. (Glory be to Thee!) exalt Allah [from any thought that He created them in vain]. (Preserve us from the doom of Fire) drive away from us the torment of hell."
رَبَّنَآ إِنَّكَ مَن تُدْخِلِ ٱلنَّارَ فَقَدْ أَخْزَيْتَهُ وَمَا لِلظَّالِمِينَ مِنْ أَنْصَارٍ,(Our Lord) they say: O our Lord! (Whom Thou causest to enter the Fire: him indeed Thou hast confounded) You have humiliated. (For evil-doers) for the idolaters (there will be no helpers) none will prevent what is going to happen to them in the Hereafter.
رَّبَّنَآ إِنَّنَآ سَمِعْنَا مُنَادِياً يُنَادِي لِلإِيمَانِ أَنْ آمِنُواْ بِرَبِّكُمْ فَآمَنَّا رَبَّنَا فَٱغْفِرْ لَنَا ذُنُوبَنَا وَكَفِّرْ عَنَّا سَيِّئَاتِنَا وَتَوَفَّنَا مَعَ ٱلأَبْرَارِ,"(Our Lord!) they say: O our Lord. (Lo! we have heard a crier) they mean Muhammad (calling unto Faith) calling to Allah's divine Oneness: (“Believe ye in your Lord!” So we believed) in You, in Your Scripture as well as in Your Messenger. (Our Lord! Therefore forgive us our sins) our enormities, (and remit from us) overlook (our evil deeds) other than enormities, (and make us die the death of the righteous) take our souls to You in a state of faith and gather them with the souls of the prophets and the righteous."
رَبَّنَا وَآتِنَا مَا وَعَدتَّنَا عَلَىٰ رُسُلِكَ وَلاَ تُخْزِنَا يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ إِنَّكَ لاَ تُخْلِفُ ٱلْمِيعَادَ,"(Our Lord!) and they say: O our Lord. (And give us that which Thou hast promised to us by Thy messengers) on the tongue of Your Messenger, i.e. Muhammad. (Confound us not) torment us not (upon the Day of Resurrection) as You will torment the unbelievers. (Lo! Thou breakest not the tryst) resurrection after death and that which You have promised the believers."
فَٱسْتَجَابَ لَهُمْ رَبُّهُمْ أَنِّي لاَ أُضِيعُ عَمَلَ عَامِلٍ مِّنْكُمْ مِّن ذَكَرٍ أَوْ أُنْثَىٰ بَعْضُكُم مِّن بَعْضٍ فَٱلَّذِينَ هَاجَرُواْ وَأُخْرِجُواْ مِن دِيَـٰرِهِمْ وَأُوذُواْ فِي سَبِيلِي وَقَـٰتَلُواْ وَقُتِلُواْ لأُكَفِّرَنَّ عَنْهُمْ سَيِّئَاتِهِمْ وَلأُدْخِلَنَّهُمْ جَنَّـٰتٍ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلأَنْهَـٰرُ ثَوَاباً مِّن عِندِ ٱللَّهِ وَٱللَّهُ عِندَهُ حُسْنُ ٱلثَّوَابِ,"(And their Lord hath heard them) and answered their request ((and He saith): Lo! I suffer not the work of any worker, male or female, to be lost) I thwart not the actions of any one of you. (Ye proceed one from another) if some of you follow the religion of others or are allies to them. Allah then exposited the honour He bestowed upon the Emigrants (al-Muhajirun), saying: (So those who fled) from Mecca to Medina with the Prophet (pbuh) and after the Prophet (and were driven forth from their homes) the Meccan unbelievers drove them from their homes in Mecca (and suffered damage for My cause) for My obedience, (and fought) the enemy in the way of Allah (and were slain) until they were killed, (verily I shall remit their evil deeds from them) which were committed in the course of jihad (and verily I shall bring them into Gardens beneath which) beneath its trees and habitations (rivers) rivers of wine, water, honey and milk (flow. A reward from Allah) a recompense for them from Allah. (And with Allah is the fairest of rewards) a good return which is better than their reward."
لاَ يَغُرَّنَّكَ تَقَلُّبُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ فِي ٱلْبِلاَدِ,"Allah then reminded them of the evanescence of this world and of the continuity of the Hereafter, and encouraged them to seek the latter, saying: (Let not the vicissitude (of the success) of those who disbelieve in the land) the coming and going of the Jews for trade, (deceive thee) O Muhammad! Although Muhammad is here the addressee, this is directed at his Companions."
مَتَاعٌ قَلِيلٌ ثُمَّ مَأْوَاهُمْ جَهَنَّمُ وَبِئْسَ ٱلْمِهَادُ,"(It is but a brief comfort) it is but a paltry benefit in the life of this world. (And afterward their habitation will be hell, an ill abode) an ill spread and end result."
لَكِنِ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱتَّقَوْاْ رَبَّهُمْ لَهُمْ جَنَّاتٌ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلأَنْهَارُ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا نُزُلاً مِّنْ عِندِ ٱللَّهِ وَمَا عِندَ ٱللَّهِ خَيْرٌ لِّلأَبْرَارِ,"(But those who keep their duty to their Lord) Allah says: and those who believe in the divine Oneness of their Lord by repenting from disbelief, (for them are Gardens beneath which) beneath its trees and habitations (rivers) of wine, water, honey and milk (flow, wherein they will be safe for ever) they dwell therein for eternity, never to die or to leave it. (A gift of welcome) a reward (from their Lord. That which Allah hath in store) in terms of reward (is better for the righteous) for those who declare Allah's divine Oneness than that which He has given the unbelievers in the life of this world."
وَإِنَّ مِنْ أَهْلِ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ لَمَن يُؤْمِنُ بِٱللَّهِ وَمَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكُمْ وَمَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْهِمْ خَٰشِعِينَ للَّهِ لاَ يَشْتَرُونَ بِآيَـٰتِ ٱللَّهِ ثَمَناً قَلِيلاً أُوْلـٰئِكَ لَهُمْ أَجْرُهُمْ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ سَرِيعُ ٱلْحِسَابِ,"Allah then described those from the people of the Book who had believed-'Abdullah Ibn Salam and his followers-saying: (And Lo! of the People of the Scripture there are some who believe in Allah and that which is revealed unto you) the Qur'an (and that which was revealed unto them) of Scripture: the Torah, (humbling themselves before Allah) humble and meek vis-à-vis Allah in worship. (They purchase not a trifling gain) a paltry recompense of means of living (at the price of the revelations of Allah) by hiding the traits and description of Muhammad in the Scripture. (Verily their reward) their recompense (is with their Lord) in Paradise, (and Lo! Allah is swift to take account) when He takes people into account, He is very swift."
يَا أَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ ٱصْبِرُواْ وَصَابِرُواْ وَرَابِطُواْ وَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ,"Allah then encouraged them to be steadfast in jihad and misfortunes, saying: (O ye who believe!) in Muhammad and the Qur'an. (Endure) in jihad along with your Prophet, (outdo all others in endurance) overwhelm and overcome your enemy, (be ready) along with your Prophet for your enemy as long as they stand in wait to attack you; it is also said that this means: (Endure) the performance of the obligations and the avoidance of transgressions, (outdo all others in endurance) overwhelm and overcome the partisans of deviant beliefs and blameworthy innovations, (be ready) with your horses for the sake of Allah, (and observe your duty to Allah) obey Allah in that which He has commanded you, such that you never abstain from it, (in order that ye may succeed) in order that you be saved from Allah's wrath and punishment'."
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّاسُ ٱتَّقُواْ رَبَّكُمُ ٱلَّذِي خَلَقَكُمْ مِّن نَّفْسٍ وَاحِدَةٍ وَخَلَقَ مِنْهَا زَوْجَهَا وَبَثَّ مِنْهُمَا رِجَالاً كَثِيراً وَنِسَآءً وَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ ٱلَّذِي تَسَآءَلُونَ بِهِ وَٱلأَرْحَامَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ عَلَيْكُمْ رَقِيباً,"And on his authority from Ibn 'Abbas on Allah's saying: (O mankind!) [he said:] 'This is an expression of general applicability, but it could also be of particular applicability. (Be careful of your duty to your Lord) obey your Lord (Who created you) by means of copulation (from a single soul) from the soul of Adam alone, for the soul of Eve was included in his (and from it) from the soul of Adam (created its mate) Eve (and from them twain has spread abroad) He created through the copulation of Adam and Eve (a multitude of men and women) scores of human beings: male and female. (Be careful of your duty towards Allah) obey Allah (in Whom ye claim (your rights) of one another) your stuff and rights by Allah's right, (and towards the wombs (that bare you)) and also by the right of kinship and filiation; or it could also mean: keep the ties of kinship and do not sever them. (Lo! Allah hath been a Watcher over you) He has been a Protector: He shall ask you about that which He has commanded you of acts of obedience and keeping ties of kinship."
وَآتُواْ ٱلْيَتَامَىٰ أَمْوَالَهُمْ وَلاَ تَتَبَدَّلُواْ ٱلْخَبِيثَ بِٱلطَّيِّبِ وَلاَ تَأْكُلُوۤاْ أَمْوَالَهُمْ إِلَىٰ أَمْوَالِكُمْ إِنَّهُ كَانَ حُوباً كَبِيراً,(Give unto orphans their wealth) which is with you when they reach the legal age. (Exchange not the good for the bad (in your management)) do not consume their wealth which is prohibited for you while leaving your own wealth which is lawful for you (nor absorb their wealth into your own wealth) by mixing them. (Lo! That) wrongfully consuming the wealth of the orphan (would be a great sin) which will be met by Allah's punishment. This was revealed about a man from Ghatafan who had in his possession a great amount of wealth that belonged to his orphaned nephew. When this verse was revealed he decided to separate the wealth of his nephew from his own for fear of committing a sin. Allah then revealed the following:
وَإِنْ خِفْتُمْ أَلاَّ تُقْسِطُواْ فِي ٱلْيَتَامَىٰ فَٱنكِحُواْ مَا طَابَ لَكُمْ مِّنَ ٱلنِّسَآءِ مَثْنَىٰ وَثُلَٰثَ وَرُبَٰعَ فَإِنْ خِفْتُمْ أَلاَّ تَعْدِلُواْ فَوَٰحِدَةً أَوْ مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَٰنُكُمْ ذٰلِكَ أَدْنَىٰ أَلاَّ تَعُولُواْ,"(And if ye fear that ye will not deal fairly by the orphans) and if you fear that you will not preserve orphans' wealth, you should also fear not dealing fairly with women in relation to providing sustenance and apportionment. This was because they used to marry as many women as they liked, as many as nine or ten. Qays Ibn al-Harth for example had eight wives. Allah forbade them from doing so and prohibited them from marrying more than four wives, saying: (marry of the women, who seem good to you) marry that which Allah has made lawful for you, (two or three or four) marry one, two, three or four but do not marry more than four wives; (and if ye fear that ye cannot do justice) to four wives in relation to apportionment and providing sustenance (then one (only)) then marry only one free woman (or that your right hands possess) of captives, and in that case you do not owe them any apportionment, and they need not observe any waiting period. (Thus it) marrying just one woman (is more likely that ye will not do injustice) that you will not incline to some at the expense of others or that you transgress regarding the provision of sustenance and apportionment to four wives."
وَءَاتُواْ ٱلنِّسَآءَ صَدُقَٰتِهِنَّ نِحْلَةً فَإِن طِبْنَ لَكُمْ عَن شَيْءٍ مِّنْهُ نَفْساً فَكُلُوهُ هَنِيئاً مَّرِيئاً,"(And give unto the women, (whom ye marry) free gift) as an obligation from Allah upon you (of their marriage portions) their dowries; (but if they of their own accord remit unto you a part thereof) if they make lawful for you to take some of the dowry, (then ye are welcome to absorb it (in your wealth)) there is no blame or sin on you if you do so. Before Islam, men used to marry without giving any dowry to their wives."
وَلاَ تُؤْتُواْ ٱلسُّفَهَآءَ أَمْوَالَكُمُ ٱلَّتِي جَعَلَ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمْ قِيَٰماً وَٱرْزُقُوهُمْ فِيهَا وَٱكْسُوهُمْ وَقُولُواْ لَهُمْ قَوْلاً مَّعْرُوفاً,"(Give not unto the foolish) do not give to those who are ignorant of the rights of women and children (your wealth which Allah hath given you to maintain) as a means of living; (but feed and clothe them from it) be yourselves responsible for feeding and clothing them, for you know better than them the right thing to do concerning sustenance and alms giving, (and speak kindly unto them) if you do not have anything to give them, promise them that you will clothe them and give to them."
وَٱبْتَلُواْ ٱلْيَتَامَىٰ حَتَّىٰ إِذَا بَلَغُواْ النِّكَاحَ فَإِنْ آنَسْتُمْ مِّنْهُمْ رُشْداً فَٱدْفَعُواْ إِلَيْهِمْ أَمْوَالَهُمْ وَلاَ تَأْكُلُوهَآ إِسْرَافاً وَبِدَاراً أَن يَكْبَرُواْ وَمَن كَانَ غَنِيّاً فَلْيَسْتَعْفِفْ وَمَن كَانَ فَقِيراً فَلْيَأْكُلْ بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ فَإِذَا دَفَعْتُمْ إِلَيْهِمْ أَمْوَالَهُمْ فَأَشْهِدُواْ عَلَيْهِمْ وَكَفَىٰ بِٱللَّهِ حَسِيباً,"(Prove orphans) test the intelligence of orphans (till they reach the marriageable age) the age of puberty; (then, if ye find them of) if you see that they possess (sound judgement) righteousness in Religion and a tendency to protect their wealth, (deliver over unto them their fortune) then give their wealth which is with you; (and devour it not squandering) it in transgression and unlawfully (and in haste) in haste lest the orphan grows older and consumes it little by little (lest they should grow up) for fear that they grow older and stop you from devouring their wealth. (Whoso (of the guardians) is rich) and needs not the orphan's wealth, (let him abstain generously) because of his richness from taking of the property of orphans, nor should he diminish anything from their wealth; (and whoso is poor) and needy (let him take thereof in reason (for his guardianship)) in measure, such that he is not in need for the wealth of orphans; it is also said that this means: he should take from the wealth of orphans in proportion with the measure of his work regarding this wealth; and it is also said that this means: he can take from the wealth of orphans as a loan to be paid back. (And when ye deliver up their fortune unto orphans) when they reach the legal age, (have (the transaction) witnessed in their presence) when you deliver it to them. (Allah sufficeth as a Reckoner) Allah suffices as a witness. This verse was revealed about Thabit Ibn Rifa'ah al-Ansari."
لِّلرِّجَالِ نَصيِبٌ مِّمَّا تَرَكَ ٱلْوَالِدَانِ وَٱلأَقْرَبُونَ وَلِلنِّسَآءِ نَصِيبٌ مِّمَّا تَرَكَ ٱلْوَالِدَانِ وَٱلأَقْرَبُونَ مِمَّا قَلَّ مِنْهُ أَوْ كَثُرَ نَصِيباً مَّفْرُوضاً,"Allah then mentioned the share of men and women in inheritance-because they were not in the habit of giving any inheritance to women and children-saying: (Unto the men (of a family) belongeth a share of that which parents and near kindred leave, and unto the women a share of that which parents and near kindred leave, whether it is a little or much) whether the inheritance is much or little (a legal share) a determined share whether it is much or little, but He did not specify these shares. Allah did expound consequently on the exact value of these shares. This verse was revealed about Umm Kuhhah and her daughters who had an uncle who did not give them anything from their inheritance."
وَإِذَا حَضَرَ ٱلْقِسْمَةَ أُوْلُواْ ٱلْقُرْبَىٰ وَٱلْيَتَامَىٰ وَٱلْمَسَاكِينُ فَٱرْزُقُوهُمْ مِّنْهُ وَقُولُواْ لَهُمْ قَوْلاً مَّعْرُوفاً,"(And when kinsfolk) who are not entitled to receive a share of the inheritance (and orphans) the orphans of believers before the division of the inheritance (and the needy) the needy among believers (are present at the division) of the heritage, (bestow on them there from) give them something of the inheritance before you proceed to divide it upon those who are entitled to receive it (and speak kindly unto them) if the inheritor has not yet reached the age of puberty, by promising them to speak to the inheritor about giving them something."
وَلْيَخْشَ ٱلَّذِينَ لَوْ تَرَكُواْ مِنْ خَلْفِهِمْ ذُرِّيَّةً ضِعَافاً خَافُواْ عَلَيْهِمْ فَلْيَتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَلْيَقُولُواْ قَوْلاً سَدِيداً,"(And let those) who visit a sick person and enjoin him to bequeath more than a third of his inheritance (fear (in their behaviour toward orphans)) the ruin of the children of this sick person after he dies (who if they left behind them) after they die (weak offspring) unable to fend for themselves (would be afraid for them) to face ruin. Just as they would fear ruin for their own children, they ought to fear ruin for the children of any deceased person; it is also said that this means: enjoin the person who is on his deathbed that which you would enjoin yourself; and fear for the loss of his children if he were to die, as you would fear for the loss of your own children if you were to die. This is because they were in the habit of visiting people who were on their deathbeds and enjoining them to give their property to this and that person until nothing was left for their own children, so Allah prohibited them from so doing. Then Allah said: (So let them mind their duty to Allah) let them fear Allah regarding the bequeathing of more than a third of the inheritance to those who are not entitled to inheritance, (and speak) to the person who is sick [expecting to die] (justly) about his will."
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يَأْكُلُونَ أَمْوَالَ ٱلْيَتَٰمَىٰ ظُلْماً إِنَّمَا يَأْكُلُونَ فِي بُطُونِهِمْ نَاراً وَسَيَصْلَوْنَ سَعِيراً,"(Lo! Those who devour the wealth of orphans wrongfully) extortionately, (they do but swallow fire into their bellies) i.e. that which is unlawful; it is also said that this means: Allah will place fire in their bellies on the Day of Judgement (and they will be exposed to burning flame) a blazing fire in the Hereafter. This verse was revealed about Hanzalah Ibn Shamardal."
يُوصِيكُمُ ٱللَّهُ فِيۤ أَوْلَٰدِكُمْ لِلذَّكَرِ مِثْلُ حَظِّ ٱلأُنْثَيَيْنِ فَإِن كُنَّ نِسَآءً فَوْقَ ٱثْنَتَيْنِ فَلَهُنَّ ثُلُثَا مَا تَرَكَ وَإِن كَانَتْ وَاحِدَةً فَلَهَا ٱلنِّصْفُ وَلأَبَوَيْهِ لِكُلِّ وَاحِدٍ مِّنْهُمَا ٱلسُّدُسُ مِمَّا تَرَكَ إِن كَانَ لَهُ وَلَدٌ فَإِن لَّمْ يَكُنْ لَّهُ وَلَدٌ وَوَرِثَهُ أَبَوَاهُ فَلأُمِّهِ ٱلثُّلُثُ فَإِن كَانَ لَهُ إِخْوَةٌ فَلأُمِّهِ ٱلسُّدُسُ مِن بَعْدِ وَصِيَّةٍ يُوصِي بِهَآ أَوْ دَيْنٍ آبَآؤُكُمْ وَأَبناؤُكُمْ لاَ تَدْرُونَ أَيُّهُمْ أَقْرَبُ لَكُمْ نَفْعاً فَرِيضَةً مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ عَلِيماً حَكِيماً,"Allah then exposited the share of the male and female in inheritance, saying: (Allah chargeth you) Allah expounds to you (concerning your children) concerning the inheritance of your children after you die: (to the male the equivalent of the portion of two females) the share of two females, (and if there be women) blood daughters (more than two) two or more daughters, (then theirs is two-thirds of the inheritance, and if there be one) daughter ((only) then the half) of the inheritance. (And to his parents a sixth of the inheritance, if he) the deceased person (have a son) or daughter; (and if he) the deceased person (have no son) or daughter (and his parents are his heirs, then to his mother appertaineth the third) and the reminder is the share of the father; (and if he) the deceased person (have brethren) full brothers or half brothers from either the father or the mother, (then to his mother appertaineth the sixth, after any legacy he may have bequeathed, or debt (hath been paid)) after paying the debt of the deceased and extracting any bequest which does not exceed a third of the inheritance. (Your parents or your children: Ye know not) in this world (which of them is nearer unto you in usefulness) in the Hereafter in terms of rank; it is also said that this means: you do not know which of them is nearer in usefulness in this world with regard to inheritance. (It is an injunction from Allah) upon you that you divide the estates. (Lo! Allah is Knower) in relation to the division of inheritance, (Wise) in relation to the difference between the shares of the male and female."

(And unto them belongeth the fourth of that which ye leave) of property (if ye have no child) male or female from them or from other than them, (but if ye have a child) male or female, from them or from other than them (then the eighth of that which ye leave) of property, (after any legacy ye may have bequeathed, or debt (ye may have contracted, hath been paid)) after paying back any debt you may have contracted and extracting any bequest you may have bequeathed to someone. (And if a man) who does not have parents, children or kinsfolk related to his parents or children (or a woman) who is in the same situation (have a distant heir (having left neither parent nor child)) brothers or sisters from the mother side. It is also said that this refers to any kin other than parents and children, (and he (or she)) the deceased (have a brother or a sister) only on the mother's side (then to each of them twain (the brother and the sister) the sixth, and if they be more than two, then they shall be sharers in the third) the male and the female having equal share, (after any legacy that may have been bequeathed or debt (contracted)) after paying back any debt that the deceased may have contracted and after extracting any bequest that he may have bequeathed provided it does not exceed a third of the inheritance (not injuring) the heirs by willing away more than a third of the inheritance (hath been paid. A commandment from Allah) it is an obligation upon you from Allah that you must divide inheritance. (Allah is Knower) regarding the division of inheritance, (Indulgent) in relation to that which happens between you of ignorance and deception regarding the division of inheritance, despite of which He does not hasten His punishment upon you."
تِلْكَ حُدُودُ ٱللَّهِ وَمَن يُطِعِ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ يُدْخِلْهُ جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلأَنْهَارُ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا وَذٰلِكَ ٱلْفَوْزُ ٱلْعَظِيمُ,"(These are the limits (imposed by) Allah) these are the legal rulings and obligations imposed by Allah.

(That will be the great success) the greatest salvation through entering Paradise."
وَمَن يَعْصِ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ وَيَتَعَدَّ حُدُودَهُ يُدْخِلْهُ نَاراً خَالِداً فِيهَا وَلَهُ عَذَابٌ مُّهِينٌ,"(And whoso disobeyeth Allah and His messenger) regarding the division of estates (and transgresseth His limits) contravenes His legal rulings and obligations through deviation and disobedience, (He will make him enter Fire, where such will dwell for ever) continually abiding in the Fire until whenever Allah wills; (his will be a shameful doom) through which he will be humiliated; it is also said that (be a shameful doom) means: a severe torment."
وَٱللاَّتِي يَأْتِينَ ٱلْفَٰحِشَةَ مِن نِّسَآئِكُمْ فَٱسْتَشْهِدُواْ عَلَيْهِنَّ أَرْبَعةً مِّنْكُمْ فَإِن شَهِدُواْ فَأَمْسِكُوهُنَّ فِي ٱلْبُيُوتِ حَتَّىٰ يَتَوَفَّاهُنَّ ٱلْمَوْتُ أَوْ يَجْعَلَ ٱللَّهُ لَهُنَّ سَبِيلاً,"(As for those of your women) your free, married women (who are guilty of lewdness) i.e. of fornication, (call to witness) that they were caught red-handed in the act (four of you against them) four of your free men. (And if they testify) to the Truth of the allegation (then confine them to the houses) keep them in prison (until death take them) until they die in prison (or (until) Allah appoint for them a way) out by means of stoning. Imprisoning a free, married woman who commits fornication until she dies in prison was later abrogated by stoning."
وَٱللَّذَانِ يَأْتِيَانِهَا مِنكُمْ فَآذُوهُمَا فَإِن تَابَا وَأَصْلَحَا فَأَعْرِضُواْ عَنْهُمَآ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ تَوَّاباً رَّحِيماً,"(And as for the two of you) of your free people, i.e. any unmarried man or woman (who are guilty thereof) who are guilty of adultery, (punish them both) by maligning and upbraiding them. (And if they repent) after this (and improve) in relation to that which is between them and Allah, (then let them be) refrain from maligning and upbraiding them. (Lo! Allah is Relenting) He overlooks sins, (Merciful). Maligning and upbraiding the unmarried person who commits adultery was later abrogated and replaced by one hundred lashes for both parties."
إِنَّمَا ٱلتَّوْبَةُ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ لِلَّذِينَ يَعْمَلُونَ ٱلسُّوۤءَ بِجَهَالَةٍ ثُمَّ يَتُوبُونَ مِن قَرِيبٍ فَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ يَتُوبُ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْهِمْ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ عَلِيماً حَكِيماً,"(Allah accepteth the repentance of those who do evil in ignorance) even if they do so purposefully while being ignorant of its respective punishment ((and) then turn quickly (in repentance) to Allah) before being led away for punishment or at the moment of suffering from the pangs of death. (These are they towards whom Allah relenteth) Allah overlooks the sins of these. (Allah is ever Knower) of your repentance, (Wise) by accepting your repentance before death, while does not accept it when one is suffering from the pangs of death or after one dies."
وَلَيْسَتِ ٱلتَّوْبَةُ لِلَّذِينَ يَعْمَلُونَ ٱلسَّيِّئَاتِ حَتَّىٰ إِذَا حَضَرَ أَحَدَهُمُ ٱلْمَوْتُ قَالَ إِنِّي تُبْتُ ٱلآنَ وَلاَ ٱلَّذِينَ يَمُوتُونَ وَهُمْ كُفَّارٌ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ أَعْتَدْنَا لَهُمْ عَذَاباً أَلِيماً,"(The forgiveness) Allah overlooking sins (is not for those who do ill deeds until, when death attendeth upon one of them) when one of them is suffering from the agony of death, (he saith: Lo! I repent now; nor yet for those who die while they are disbelievers). Allah says that He does not accept the repentance of unbelievers at the moment they suffer the pangs of death. (For such) for the unbelievers (We have prepared a painful doom) this was revealed about Tu'mah and his companions who had left Islam."
يَٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ لاَ يَحِلُّ لَكُمْ أَن تَرِثُواْ ٱلنِّسَآءَ كَرْهاً وَلاَ تَعْضُلُوهُنَّ لِتَذْهَبُواْ بِبَعْضِ مَآ ءَاتَيْتُمُوهُنَّ إِلاَّ أَن يَأْتِينَ بِفَٰحِشَةٍ مُّبَيِّنَةٍ وَعَاشِرُوهُنَّ بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ فَإِن كَرِهْتُمُوهُنَّ فَعَسَىٰ أَن تَكْرَهُواْ شَيْئاً وَيَجْعَلَ ٱللَّهُ فِيهِ خَيْراً كَثِيراً,"(O ye who believe! It is not lawful for you forcibly) coercively (to inherit the women (of your deceased kinsmen)) the women of your fathers, (nor (that) ye should put constraint upon them) by preventing them from marrying again. This verse was revealed about Kabshah Bint Ma'an al-Ansariyyah and Muhsin Ibn Abi Qays al-Ansari; for before the advent of Islam, they used to inherit the women of their fathers (that ye may take away a part of that which ye have given them) take away part of that which your fathers gave them, (unless they be guilty of flagrant lewdness) unless they are guilty of fornication by the testimony of witnesses in which case they should be imprisoned. However, imprisoning fornicators was abrogated by the verse on stoning. In the pre-Islamic period, men used to inherit the wives of their fathers in the same way as they inherited their properties. The wife of a deceased father used to be inherited by the eldest son. If the woman was rich and beautiful, the eldest son would marry her without giving her any dowry. If, however, she was neither rich, young nor beautiful, he would not marry her but instead leave her untouched until she ransomed herself with her own money. Allah forbade them from indulging in such a practice. Then He showed them how one must treat women, saying: (But consort with them) keep their company (in kindness) with beneficence and goodness, (for if ye hate them) i.e. hate their company (it may happen that ye hate a thing) their company (wherein Allah hath placed much good) Allah may provide you with righteous children from them."
وَإِنْ أَرَدْتُّمُ ٱسْتِبْدَالَ زَوْجٍ مَّكَانَ زَوْجٍ وَآتَيْتُمْ إِحْدَاهُنَّ قِنْطَاراً فَلاَ تَأْخُذُواْ مِنْهُ شَيْئاً أَتَأْخُذُونَهُ بُهْتَاناً وَإِثْماً مُّبِيناً,"(And if ye wish to exchange one wife for another) He says: If you wish to marry a woman and divorce one you are already married to, or marry a woman in addition to the one you are already married to (and ye have given unto one of them a sum of money (however great)) a dowry, (take nothing from it) from the dowry. (Would ye take it) the dowry (by the way of calumny) as an unlawful possession (and open wrong?) a clear transgression."
وَكَيْفَ تَأْخُذُونَهُ وَقَدْ أَفْضَىٰ بَعْضُكُمْ إِلَىٰ بَعْضٍ وَأَخَذْنَ مِنكُم مِّيثَٰقاً غَلِيظاً,"(How can ye take it (back)) how can you take the dowry back as a lawful possession. (after one of you hath gone in unto the other) when you have come together under one cover as a result of this dowry and marriage, (and they have taken) He says: Allah has taken from you upon marrying women (a strong pledge from you?) a firm pledge that you either keep them in goodness or release them in kindness. Then Allah forbade them from marrying the wives of their fathers, since this is what they did in the pre-Islamic era."
وَلاَ تَنكِحُواْ مَا نَكَحَ ءَابَآؤُكُمْ مِّنَ ٱلنِّسَآءِ إِلاَّ مَا قَدْ سَلَفَ إِنَّهُ كَانَ فَاحِشَةً وَمَقْتاً وَسَآءَ سَبِيلاً,"He said: (And marry not those women whom your fathers married, except what hath already happened (of that nature) in the past) in the pre-Islamic era. (Lo! It) i.e. marrying the wives of one's father (was ever lewdness) a transgression (and abomination) antagonism, (and an evil way) the worst way to follow. This was revealed about Muhsin Ibn Abi Qays al-Ansari. Allah then showed them the women who are unlawful for them to marry."

(And (it is forbidden unto you) that ye should have two sisters together) whether they are free or slave sisters, (except what hath already happened (of that nature) in the past) before Islam. (Lo! Allah is ever Forgiving) of that which ensued from you in the pre-Islamic era, (Merciful) regarding that which ensues from you in Islam, provided that you repent."

(It is a decree of Allah for you) that which I have mentioned to you is unlawful in Allah's Book. (Lawful unto you are all beyond those mentioned) as unlawful, (so that ye seek them) marry (with your wealth) up to four wives; it is also said that this means: so that you buy with your wealth captives; and it is also said that this means: so that you should seek with your money marrying women for an agreed period of time (zawaj al-mut'ah) but the lawfulness of this practice was later abrogated, (in honest wedlock) He says: be with them as legitimate husbands, (not debauchery) not indulging in adultery without having a proper marriage. (And those of whom) after marriage (ye seek content) from whom you derive benefit, (give unto them their portions) give to them their full dowry (as a duty) as an obligation upon you from Allah to give the dowry in full. (And there is no sin for you) there is no harm for you (in what ye do by mutual agreement) in increasing or decreasing the amount of the dowry by mutual agreement (after the duty hath been done) after the first obligation to which you have aspired. (Lo! Allah is ever Knower) in relation to making lawful to you marriage for an agreed, limited period of time, (Wise) in later making this practice unlawful; it is also said that this means: Allah is ever Knower of your compulsion for marriage for an agreed, limited period of time, Wise in making such marriage unlawful."

(Allah knoweth best (concerning) your faith) He knows best that your hearts are firm in faith. (Ye (proceed) one from another) You are all the children of Adam; it is also said that this means: some of you follow the religion of others; and it is also said that this means: you are strengthened by one another; (so wed them) marry the maids (by permission of their folk) their owners, (and give unto them) the maids (their portions) their dowry (in kindness) on top of the price given to the prostitute for providing sex, (they being honest) He says: marry those maids who are chaste, (not debauched) not those who commit adultery in the open (nor of loose conduct) nor those who have lovers who commit adultery with them in secret. (And if when they are honourably married) if when they marry maids (they commit lewdness) fornication (they) the maids (shall incur the half of the punishment (prescribed)) lashing (for free women (in that case). This is) marrying maids is lawful (for him among you who feareth to commit sin) adultery and debauchery. (But to have patience) and refrain from marrying maids (would be better for you) in that your children would be free. (Allah is Forgiving) of the adultery you might commit, (Merciful) when He gave you a legal dispensation to marry captives in cases of necessity."

(Allah is Knower) that you have a dire need for marriage, (Wise) when He prohibited you to marry them except upon necessity."
وَٱللَّهُ يُرِيدُ أَن يَتُوبَ عَلَيْكُمْ وَيُرِيدُ ٱلَّذِينَ يَتَّبِعُونَ ٱلشَّهَوَاتِ أَن تَمِيلُواْ مَيْلاً عَظِيماً,"(And Allah wishes to turn to you in mercy) He wishes to overlook your transgression when He made adultery and marrying your sisters, from the father's side, forbidden for you; (but those who follow vain desires) i.e. adultery and marrying their sisters from their fathers' side, namely, the Jews (would have you go tremendously astray) commit a serious error by marrying your sisters, from the father's side, by claiming that it is lawful in their Scripture."
يُرِيدُ ٱللَّهُ أَن يُخَفِّفَ عَنْكُمْ وَخُلِقَ ٱلإِنسَانُ ضَعِيفاً,"(Allah would make the burden light for you) He wishes to make things easy for you by marrying captives in case of necessity, (for man was created weak) in that he cannot do without women."

(Lo! Allah is ever Merciful unto you) when He forbade you to kill one another without such a justification."
وَمَن يَفْعَلْ ذٰلِكَ عُدْوَاناً وَظُلْماً فَسَوْفَ نُصْلِيهِ نَاراً وَكَانَ ذٰلِكَ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ يَسِيراً,"(Whoso doeth that) killing another or wrongfully taking another person's property (through aggression and injustice, We shall cast him into Fire) in the Hereafter; this is a threat to such a person, (and that) casting him into the Fire and tormenting him (is ever easy for Allah)."
إِن تَجْتَنِبُواْ كَبَآئِرَ مَا تُنْهَوْنَ عَنْهُ نُكَفِّرْ عَنْكُمْ سَيِّئَـٰتِكُمْ وَنُدْخِلْكُمْ مُّدْخَلاً كَرِيماً,"(If you avoid the great (things) which ye are forbidden) in this surah, (We will remit from you your evil deeds) We will forgive you your sins which are not included among the enormities: the minor sins committed between the period separating a congregational prayer from another, those sins committed in the period separating one Friday Prayer from another, as well as those sins committed in the period separating one month of Ramadan from another, (and make you enter) in the Hereafter (at a noble gate) Paradise."
وَلاَ تَتَمَنَّوْاْ مَا فَضَّلَ ٱللَّهُ بِهِ بَعْضَكُمْ عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ لِّلرِّجَالِ نَصِيبٌ مِّمَّا ٱكْتَسَبُواْ وَلِلنِّسَآءِ نَصِيبٌ مِّمَّا ٱكْتَسَبْنَ وَٱسْأَلُواْ ٱللَّهَ مِن فَضْلِهِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عَلِيماً,"(And covet not the thing in which Allah hath made some of you excel others) Allah says: a man should not covet the wealth, mount or wife of his brother nor, in fact, anything that his brother may possess. Rather you should ask of Allah abundant bounty and say: “O Allah provide us with the like of, or better than, what you have provided him with”, while consigning the matter to Allah. It is also said that this verse was revealed about Umm Salamah, the wife of the Prophet (pbuh) because she said to him: “if only it is prescribed unto us as it is prescribed unto men so that we get rewarded as men do”. Allah prohibited such talk, saying: covet not the thing in which Allah has made a group of you excel over others, such as praying in congregation, attending the Friday Prayer, participating in military expeditions, jihad, enjoining good and forbidding evil. In this verse (some of you) and (others) refers to men and women. Allah then explained the reward that men and women earn for their works, saying: (Unto men a fortune) a reward (from that which they have earned) of works of goodness, (and unto women a fortune) a reward (from that which they have earned) of works of goodness in their homes. (But ask Allah of His bounty) Ask Allah to give you success and protection. (Lo! Allah is ever Knower of all things) good and bad, reward and punishment, success and otherwise."
وَلِكُلٍّ جَعَلْنَا مَوَٰلِيَ مِمَّا تَرَكَ ٱلْوَٰلِدَانِ وَٱلأَقْرَبُونَ وَٱلَّذِينَ عَقَدَتْ أَيْمَٰنُكُمْ فَآتُوهُمْ نَصِيبَهُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ شَهِيداً,"(And unto each) He says: to each one of you (We have appointed heirs) so that they inherit (of that which parents and near kindred leave) of property; (and as for those with whom your right hands have made a covenant) your stipulation, (give them their due) give them their stipulation. But this is now abrogated. In the pre-Islamic era, they used to adopt men and youth and allocate for them a portion of their wealth, just as they would do with their own children. Allah abrogated such a practice. However, it is not abrogated if he gives them their portion from a third of his wealth. (Lo! Allah is ever witness over) Allah knows (all things) relating to your works."
ٱلرِّجَالُ قَوَّٰمُونَ عَلَى ٱلنِّسَآءِ بِمَا فَضَّلَ ٱللَّهُ بَعْضَهُمْ عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ وَبِمَآ أَنْفَقُواْ مِنْ أَمْوَٰلِهِمْ فَٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتُ قَٰنِتَٰتٌ حَٰفِظَٰتٌ لِّلْغَيْبِ بِمَا حَفِظَ ٱللَّهُ وَٱلَّٰتِي تَخَافُونَ نُشُوزَهُنَّ فَعِظُوهُنَّ وَٱهْجُرُوهُنَّ فِي ٱلْمَضَاجِعِ وَٱضْرِبُوهُنَّ فَإِنْ أَطَعْنَكُمْ فَلاَ تَبْغُواْ عَلَيْهِنَّ سَبِيلاً إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ عَلِيّاً كَبِيراً,"(Men are in charge of women) they are in charge of overseeing the proper conduct of women, (because Allah hath made the one of them) the men through reason and the division of booty and estates (to excel the other) the women, (and because they spend of their property (for the support of women)) through paying the dowry and spending on them, which the women are not required to do. (So good women) He says: those wives who are kind to their husbands (are the obedient) they are obedient to Allah regarding their husbands, (guarding) their own persons and the wealth of their husbands (in secret) when their husbands are not present (that which Allah hath guarded) through Allah's protection of them in that He gave them the success to do so. (As for those from whom ye fear) know (rebellion) their disobedience to you in bed, (admonish them) by means of sacred knowledge and the Qur'an (and banish them to beds apart) turn your faces away from them in bed, (and scourge them) in a mild, unexaggerated manner. (Then if they obey you) in bed, (seek not a way against them) as regards love. (Lo! Allah is ever High Exalted) above every single thing, (Great) greater than every single thing. Allah has not burdened you with that which you cannot bear, so do not burden women with that which they cannot bear of affection."
وَإِنْ خِفْتُمْ شِقَاقَ بَيْنِهِمَا فَٱبْعَثُواْ حَكَماً مِّنْ أَهْلِهِ وَحَكَماً مِّنْ أَهْلِهَآ إِن يُرِيدَآ إِصْلَٰحاً يُوَفِّقِ ٱللَّهُ بَيْنَهُمَآ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ عَلِيماً خَبِيراً,"(And if ye fear) if you know (a breech between them twain (the man and wife)) a dispute between the man and woman and you cannot establish who is at fault, (appoint an arbiter from his folk) from the man's folk to the man so that he can hear what he has to say and therefore establish whether he is in the right or wrong (and an arbiter from her folk) from the woman's folk to the woman in order to hear what she has to say and therefore establish whether she is in the right or wrong. (If they) the arbiters (desire amendment) between the man and the woman, (Allah will make them of one mind) i.e. the arbiters, the man and the woman. (Lo! Allah is ever Knower) of the agreement and disagreement of the arbiters, (Aware) of the doing of the woman and the man. The verses from Allah's saying: (Men are in charge of women, because Allah hath made the one of them to excel the other…) to His saying: (If they desire amendment Allah will make them of one mind. Lo! Allah is ever Knower, Aware) were revealed about the daughter of Muhammad Ibn Salamah. Her husband, As'ad Ibn al-Rabi' had slapped her because she refused to sleep with him. Consequently, she went to the Prophet (pbuh) to seek retaliation against her husband, but Allah prohibited her from doing so."
وَٱعْبُدُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَلاَ تُشْرِكُواْ بِهِ شَيْئاً وَبِٱلْوَٰلِدَيْنِ إِحْسَاناً وَبِذِي ٱلْقُرْبَىٰ وَٱلْيَتَٰمَىٰ وَٱلْمَسَٰكِينِ وَٱلْجَارِ ذِي ٱلْقُرْبَىٰ وَٱلْجَارِ ٱلْجُنُبِ وَٱلصَّاحِبِ بِٱلجَنْبِ وَٱبْنِ ٱلسَّبِيلِ وَمَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَٰنُكُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لاَ يُحِبُّ مَن كَانَ مُخْتَالاً فَخُوراً,"(And serve Allah) acknowledge His divine Oneness. (Ascribe no thing) no idol (as partner unto Him. (Show) kindness unto parents) be dutiful to parents, (and unto near kindred) Allah commands you to keep ties with your kin, (and orphans) He commands that you show kindness to orphans, and to protect their wealth, etc, (and the needy) and He enjoins giving alms to the needy, (and unto the neighbour who is of kin (unto you)) the neighbour who also happen to be your relative has three rights over you: the right of kinship, the right of Islam, and the right of being a neighbour (and the neighbour who is not of kin) the neighbour who is not a relative has two rights: the right of Islam and the right of being a neighbour (and the fellow traveller) a fellow traveller has two rights: the right of Islam and the right of companionship; it is also said that this refers to one's wife at home. Allah commands kindness towards her (and the wayfarer) Allah commands the honouring of guests. Honouring a guest for three days is the guest's right. The honour bestowed on the guest after the third day is considered a charity on the part of the host; (and (the slaves) whom your right hands possess) Allah commands kindness towards slaves, males and females. (Lo! Allah loveth not such as are proud) in their walking (and boastful) about the bounties of Allah, showing nothing but wantonness and arrogance towards Allah's servants,"
ٱلَّذِينَ يَبْخَلُونَ وَيَأْمُرُونَ ٱلنَّاسَ بِٱلْبُخْلِ وَيَكْتُمُونَ مَآ آتَاهُمُ ٱللَّهُ مِن فَضْلِهِ وَأَعْتَدْنَا لِلْكَافِرِينَ عَذَاباً مُّهِيناً,"(Who are avaricious) by concealing the traits and description of Muhammad as mentioned in their Scripture. These are Ka'b Ibn al-Ashraf and his companions (and enjoin avarice) concealment (on others, and hide that which Allah hath bestowed upon them) they hide that which Allah exposited to them in their Scripture (of His bounty) of the traits and description of Muhammad. (For disbelievers) for the Jews (We prepare a shameful doom) through which they will be humiliated;"
وَٱلَّذِينَ يُنْفِقُونَ أَمْوَالَهُمْ رِئَـآءَ ٱلنَّاسِ وَلاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱللَّهِ وَلاَ بِٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلآخِرِ وَمَن يَكُنِ ٱلشَّيْطَانُ لَهُ قَرِيناً فَسَآءَ قِرِيناً,"(And (also) those) the Jewish leaders (who spend their wealth in order to be seen of men) by showing off to people so that they say about them that they follow the practice of Abraham and that they give and spend of their money, (and believe not in Allah) Muhammad or the Qur'an (nor the Last Day) resurrection after death nor in the bliss of Paradise. (Whoso taketh Satan for a comrade) a helper in this world, (a bad comrade hath he) an evil companion he will have in hell."
وَمَاذَا عَلَيْهِمْ لَوْ آمَنُواْ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلآخِرِ وَأَنْفَقُواْ مِمَّا رَزَقَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ بِهِم عَلِيماً,"(What have they (to fear)) i.e. the Jews (if they believe in Allah) Muhammad and the Qur'an (and the Last Day) in resurrection after death and the bliss of Paradise (and spend (aright) of that which Allah hath bestowed upon them?) and spend in the way of Allah from that which Allah has given to them, (when Allah is ever Aware of them) i.e. of the Jews: those among them who believe and those among them who do not."
إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لاَ يَظْلِمُ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ وَإِن تَكُ حَسَنَةً يُضَٰعِفْهَا وَيُؤْتِ مِن لَّدُنْهُ أَجْراً عَظِيماً,"(Lo! Allah wrongeth not even of the weight of an ant) He will not leave of the works of the unbeliever even the weight of an ant to benefit him in the Hereafter or to restore the wrongs committed against his antagonists; (and if there is a good deed) for the sincere believer after restoring the wrongs committed against his antagonists, (He will double it) from one to ten times (and will give (the doer) from His presence an immense reward) an abundant reward in Paradise."
فَكَيْفَ إِذَا جِئْنَا مِن كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ بِشَهِيدٍ وَجِئْنَا بِكَ عَلَىٰ هَـٰؤُلاۤءِ شَهِيداً,"(But how (will it be with them)) how shall the unbelievers react (when we bring of every people a witness) a prophet who will testify that he has delivered the message to them, (and We bring thee) O Muhammad (a witness against these?) it is also said that this means: We bring you, O Muhammad, a witness in favour of your Community, testifying that it is reliable and upright. This is because his Community will be a witness for the other prophets against their nations when the latter will deny having received any message from them."

We did not associate any partner with you."

(And if ye be ill) wounded, (or on a journey, or one of you cometh from the closet, or ye have touched women) made love to them, (and ye find not water, then go to high clean soil and rub your faces) with the first clap (and your hands (therewith)) with the second clap.

This was revealed about al-Yasa' and Rafi' the sons of Harmalah, two Jewish Rabbis, who invited 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy and his friends to embrace their religion."

If they had said: “We hear) your saying, O Muhammad (and we obey) your command; (hear you) hear from us, (and look at us” it had been better for them) than their insults and defamation, (and more upright) and more correct. (But Allah hath cursed them) punishes them by making them pay the capitation tax (for their disbelief) as a punishment for their disbelief, (so they believe not, save a few) among them who have accepted Islam such as 'Abdullah Ibn Salam and his friends."

(And the commandment of Allah is always executed) after the revelation of this verse 'Abdullah Ibn Salam and his companions embraced Islam."

Malik Ibn al-Sayf and his friends who were about seventy people, (how they believe in idols) this is Huyayy Ibn Akhtab (and false deities) Ka'b Ibn Ashraf, (and bow they say of those (idolaters) who disbelieve) the unbelievers of Mecca: (“These are more rightly guided) they have a better religion (than those who believe?”) in the Qur'an and in Muhammad and his Religion."

(Lo! comely is this which Allah admonisheth you) comely is this which Allah commands you, of giving back deposits to their owners and judging justly. (Lo! Allah is ever Hearer) when al-'Abbas said: O Messenger of Allah! give me both the key and the providing of water, (Seer) of what 'Uthman Ibn Talhah did when he refused to give the key and said: By Allah's trust!

(Satan would mislead them far astray) from the Truth and guidance. This verse was revealed about a hypocrite by the name of Bishr whom 'Umar Ibn al-Khattab had killed. This hypocrite had a dispute with a Jewish man."
وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمْ تَعَالَوْاْ إِلَىٰ مَآ أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ وَإِلَى ٱلرَّسُولِ رَأَيْتَ ٱلْمُنَٰفِقِينَ يَصُدُّونَ عَنكَ صُدُوداً,"(And then it is said unto them) to Hatib Ibn Abi Balta'ah, the hypocrite, who had a dispute with al-Zubayr Ibn al-'Awwam, the cousin of the Prophet (pbuh): (Come unto that which Allah hath revealed) come to the ruling which Allah has revealed in the Qur'an (and unto the messenger) and to the judgement of the messenger, (thou seest the hypocrites) Hatib Ibn Abi Balta'ah (turn from you with aversion) turn away from your judgement in complete rejection."
فَكَيْفَ إِذَآ أَصَٰبَتْهُمْ مُّصِيبَةٌ بِمَا قَدَّمَتْ أَيْدِيهِمْ ثُمَّ جَآءُوكَ يَحْلِفُونَ بِٱللَّهِ إِنْ أَرَدْنَآ إِلاَّ إِحْسَٰناً وَتَوْفِيقاً,"(How would it be) what shall they do (if a misfortune) a punishment (smote them because of that which their own hands have sent before (them)) because of turning away (they come unto you) after that, (swearing by Allah) i.e. Hatib swearing by Allah (that they were seeking naught) when they turned away (but harmony) in speech (and kindness) correctness."
أُولَـٰئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ يَعْلَمُ ٱللَّهُ مَا فِي قُلُوبِهِمْ فَأَعْرِضْ عَنْهُمْ وَعِظْهُمْ وَقُل لَّهُمْ فِيۤ أَنْفُسِهِمْ قَوْلاً بَلِيغاً,"(Those are they) i.e. him who did turn away from the Prophet (pbuh) (the secrets of whose hearts Allah knoweth) He knows the hypocrisy in the heart of Hatib Ibn Abi Balta'ah. Another interpretation of the above verse is: How shall they do-those who established a counter mosque-when a punishment strikes them, because of the counter mosque they built, and then afterward came to you-Tha'labah and Hatib-swearing by Allah that they did not intend by the building of the mosque except kindness to the believers and religious harmony, so that you send us a man of knowledge to teach us? Allah knows the hypocrisy and antagonism in the hearts of those who built this counter mosque. (So oppose them) leave them and do not punish them this time (and admonish them) with your words so that they do not do it again, (and address them in plain terms about their souls) threaten them in an unequivocal way that you will punish them if they do it again."
وَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن رَّسُولٍ إِلاَّ لِيُطَاعَ بِإِذْنِ ٱللَّهِ وَلَوْ أَنَّهُمْ إِذ ظَّلَمُوۤاْ أَنْفُسَهُمْ جَآءُوكَ فَٱسْتَغْفَرُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَٱسْتَغْفَرَ لَهُمُ ٱلرَّسُولُ لَوَجَدُواْ ٱللَّهَ تَوَّاباً رَّحِيماً,"(We sent no messenger save that he) that the messenger (should be obeyed by Allah's leave) by Allah's command; We do not send him so that he is opposed or has his judgement rejected by turning away from him. (And if, when they) those who built the counter mosque and Hatib (had wronged themselves) by so building it and turning away from you, (they had but come unto thee) to repent (and asked forgiveness of Allah) repented to Allah for their actions (and asked forgiveness of the messenger) and the Messenger prayed for them, (they would have found Allah Forgiving) He overlooks their transgressions, (Merciful) He is after repentance."
فَلاَ وَرَبِّكَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ حَتَّىٰ يُحَكِّمُوكَ فِيمَا شَجَرَ بَيْنَهُمْ ثُمَّ لاَ يَجِدُواْ فِيۤ أَنْفُسِهِمْ حَرَجاً مِّمَّا قَضَيْتَ وَيُسَلِّمُواْ تَسْلِيماً,"(But nay, by your lord) Allah swore by Himself and by the age of Muhammad, (they will not believe) in secret nor deserve to be called believers when alone (until they make thee judge of what is in dispute between them and find within themselves) in their hearts (no dislike) no doubt (of that which thou decidest) between them, (and submit with full submission) totally submit to you."
وَلَوْ أَنَّا كَتَبْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ أَنِ ٱقْتُلُوۤاْ أَنْفُسَكُمْ أَوِ ٱخْرُجُواْ مِن دِيَارِكُمْ مَّا فَعَلُوهُ إِلاَّ قَلِيلٌ مِّنْهُمْ وَلَوْ أَنَّهُمْ فَعَلُواْ مَا يُوعَظُونَ بِهِ لَكَانَ خَيْراً لَّهُمْ وَأَشَدَّ تَثْبِيتاً,"(And if We had decreed for them) as We decreed for the Children of Israel: (Lay down your lives or go forth from your dwellings) empty handed, (but few of them) among the sincere ones, i.e. their leader Thabit Ibn Qays Ibn Shammas al-Ansari (would have done it) with a good disposition of the soul; (though if they) the hypocrites (did what they are exhorted) commanded (to do) of repentance and sincerity (it would be better for them) in the Hereafter than the condition they are in secret, (and more strengthening) and more real in this world;"
وَإِذاً لأَتَيْنَٰهُم مِّن لَّدُنَّـآ أَجْراً عَظِيماً,"(And then) if they did what they were commanded to do (We should bestow upon them from Our presence) from Us (an immense reward) an abundant reward in Paradise,"
وَلَهَدَيْنَاهُمْ صِرَاطاً مُّسْتَقِيماً,"(And should guide them unto a straight path) and We would have made them in this world firm upon an established Religion that We are pleased with, i.e. Islam."
وَمَن يُطِعِ ٱللَّهَ وَٱلرَّسُولَ فَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ مَعَ ٱلَّذِينَ أَنْعَمَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْهِم مِّنَ ٱلنَّبِيِّينَ وَٱلصِّدِّيقِينَ وَٱلشُّهَدَآءِ وَٱلصَّالِحِينَ وَحَسُنَ أُولَـٰئِكَ رَفِيقاً,"(Whoso obeyeth Allah and the messenger) this verse was revealed about Thawban, the client of Allah's Messenger (pbuh) who said: “I am afraid not to meet you in the Hereafter, O Messenger of Allah!” This is because he loved him intensely and could not bear being away from him. Allah's Messenger saw the change in him and so Allah mentioned the honour bestowed on him, saying: whoever obeys Allah regarding the obligations and obeys the Prophet regarding the prophetic practices (they are) in Paradise (with those unto whom Allah hath shown favour, of the Prophets) Muhammad (pbuh) and the other prophets, (and the saints) the best among the Companions of the Prophet (pbuh) (and the martyrs) those who were martyred in the way of Allah (and the righteous) the righteous among the Community of Muhammad (pbuh). (The best of company are they) in Paradise!"
ذٰلِكَ ٱلْفَضْلُ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ وَكَفَىٰ بِٱللَّهِ عَلِيماً,"(Such) keeping the company of the prophets, saints, martyrs and righteous (is the bounty of Allah) a favour from Allah, (and Allah sufficeth as knower) of the love of Thawban and the honour and reward bestowed upon him in Paradise."
يَٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءامَنُواْ خُذُواْ حِذْرَكُمْ فَٱنفِرُواْ ثُبَاتٍ أَوِ ٱنْفِرُواْ جَمِيعاً,"Knowing that they went out to fight in the way of Allah, Allah said: (O ye who believe) in Muhammad and the Qur'an! (Take your precautions) against your enemy and do not advance dispersed, (then advance the proven ones) then put forward the ones that are the best, (or advance all together) with your Prophet."
وَإِنَّ مِنْكُمْ لَمَن لَّيُبَطِّئَنَّ فَإِنْ أَصَٰبَتْكُمْ مُّصِيبَةٌ قَالَ قَدْ أَنْعَمَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيَّ إِذْ لَمْ أَكُنْ مَّعَهُمْ شَهِيداً,"(Lo! among you) O group of believers (there is he who loitereth) there is him who cannot bring himself to go out in the way of Allah-meaning 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy-but rather waits to see what happens to you on your expedition; (and if) on your expedition (disaster) death, defeat or hardship (overtook you, he) 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy (would say: Allah hath been gracious unto me) by my staying back (since I was not present with them) on that expedition."
وَلَئِنْ أَصَٰبَكُمْ فَضْلٌ مِنَ الله لَيَقُولَنَّ كَأَن لَّمْ تَكُنْ بَيْنَكُمْ وَبَيْنَهُ مَوَدَّةٌ يٰلَيتَنِي كُنتُ مَعَهُمْ فَأَفُوزَ فَوْزاً عَظِيماً,"(And if) on that expedition (a bounty) conquest and booty (from Allah befell you, he) 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy (would surely cry, as if there had been no love between you and him:) a bond of Religion and acquaintance due to keeping each other's company between you (Oh, would that I had been with them!) on the expedition, (then should I have achieved a great success) I would have gained abundant booty and a great share."
فَلْيُقَاتِلْ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلَّذِينَ يَشْرُونَ ٱلْحَيَاةَ ٱلدُّنْيَا بِٱلآخِرَةِ وَمَن يُقَاتِلْ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ فَيُقْتَلْ أَو يَغْلِبْ فَسَوْفَ نُؤْتِيهِ أَجْراً عَظِيماً,"Allah then commanded them to fight in the way of Allah, if they happened to be hypocrites, saying: (Let those fight in the way of Allah) in obedience of Allah (who sell the life of this world for the other) those who prefer this world over the next; it is also said that this verse was revealed about sincere believers, telling them: let those who prefer the Hereafter over this world fight in the way of Allah. Then Allah mentioned their reward, saying: (Whoso fighteth in the way of Allah) in obedience of Allah, (be he slain) martyred (or be he victorious) triumphant over the enemy, (on him We shall bestow) in both cases (a vast reward) an abundant reward in Paradise."
وَمَا لَكُمْ لاَ تُقَٰتِلُونَ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ وَٱلْمُسْتَضْعَفِينَ مِنَ ٱلرِّجَالِ وَٱلنِّسَآءِ وَٱلْوِلْدَٰنِ ٱلَّذِينَ يَقُولُونَ رَبَّنَآ أَخْرِجْنَا مِنْ هَـٰذِهِ ٱلْقَرْيَةِ ٱلظَّالِمِ أَهْلُهَا وَٱجْعَلْ لَّنَا مِن لَّدُنْكَ وَلِيّاً وَٱجْعَلْ لَّنَا مِن لَّدُنْكَ نَصِيراً,"Allah then mentioned their dislike of fighting in the way of Allah, saying: (How should ye) O group of believers (not fight for the cause of Allah) in obedience of Allah against the people of Mecca (and of the feeble among men and of the women and the children who are crying) in Mecca: (Our Lord!) O our Lord! (Bring us forth from out this town) i.e. Mecca (of which the people are oppressors!) whose people are idolaters (Oh, give us from Thy presence) from You (some protecting friend!) a protector, meaning: 'Itab Ibn Usayd. (Oh, give us from Thy presence) from You (some defender!) who would prevent us from suffering. Allah answered their prayers and made the Prophet (pbuh) their defender and 'Itab their protecting friend."
ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ يُقَٰتِلُونَ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ وَٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ يُقَٰتِلُونَ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱلطَّٰغُوتِ فَقَٰتِلُوۤاْ أَوْلِيَاءَ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنِ إِنَّ كَيْدَ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنِ كَانَ ضَعِيفاً,"Then Allah mentioned their fighting in the way of Allah, saying: (Those who believe) Muhammad and his Companions (do battle for the cause of Allah; and those who disbelieve) Abu Sufyan and his companions (do battle for the cause of idols) in obedience of Satan. (So fight the minions of the devil) the soldiers of the devil. (Lo! the devil's strategy) the devil's work and stratagem (is ever weak) in that he will let them down as he did on the Day of Badr."
أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى ٱلَّذِينَ قِيلَ لَهُمْ كُفُّوۤاْ أَيْدِيَكُمْ وَأَقِيمُواْ ٱلصَّلَٰوةَ وَآتُواْ ٱلزَّكَٰوةَ فَلَمَّا كُتِبَ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلْقِتَالُ إِذَا فَرِيقٌ مِّنْهُمْ يَخْشَوْنَ ٱلنَّاسَ كَخَشْيَةِ ٱللَّهِ أَوْ أَشَدَّ خَشْيَةً وَقَالُواْ رَبَّنَا لِمَ كَتَبْتَ عَلَيْنَا ٱلْقِتَالَ لَوْلاۤ أَخَّرْتَنَا إِلَىٰ أَجَلٍ قَرِيبٍ قُلْ مَتَاعُ ٱلدُّنْيَا قَلِيلٌ وَٱلآخِرَةُ خَيْرٌ لِّمَنِ ٱتَّقَىٰ وَلاَ تُظْلَمُونَ فَتِيلاً,"Allah then mentioned their dislike of joining the Prophet on the lesser Badr, saying: (Hast thou not seen) have you not been informed, O Muhammad, about (those unto whom it was said) those to whom you said in Mecca, referring to 'Abd al-Rahman Ibn 'Awf al-Zuhri, Sa'd Ibn Abi Waqqas al-Zuhri, Qudamah Ibn Maz'un al-Jumahi, Miqdad Ibn al-Aswad al-Kindi and Talhah Ibn 'Abdullah al-Tamimi: (Withhold your hands) from killing and beating, for I have not ordered the initiation of fighting, (establish worship) establish the five daily prayers in full with their bowings and prostrations and that which is obligated therein of their appointed times (and pay the poor-due) give the poor their due from your wealth, (but when fighting) jihad in the way of Allah (was prescribed) obligated (for them) in Medina (behold, a party of them) among them Talhah Ibn 'Abdullah (fear mankind) the people of Mecca (even as their fear of Allah or with greater fear, and say: Our Lord!) O our Lord! (Why hast Thou ordained fighting for us?) why have You obligated on us jihad in Your way? (If only Thou wouldst give us respite yet a while!) if only You would keep us safe for a short while before death. (Say) to them, O Muhammad: (The comfort of this world) the benefit of this world (is scant) in the Hereafter; (the Hereafter) the reward of the Hereafter (will be better for him who wardeth off (evil)) who ward off disbelief, idolatry and indecencies; (and ye will not be wronged the down upon a date stone) their good deeds will not be diminished even if it be as much as the down on a date stone."
أَيْنَمَا تَكُونُواْ يُدْرِككُّمُ ٱلْمَوْتُ وَلَوْ كُنتُمْ فِي بُرُوجٍ مُّشَيَّدَةٍ وَإِن تُصِبْهُمْ حَسَنَةٌ يَقُولُواْ هَـٰذِهِ مِنْ عِندِ ٱللَّهِ وَإِن تُصِبْهُمْ سَيِّئَةٌ يَقُولُواْ هَـٰذِهِ مِنْ عِندِكَ قُلْ كُلٌّ مِّنْ عِندِ ٱللَّهِ فَمَالِ هَـٰؤُلاۤءِ ٱلْقَوْمِ لاَ يَكَادُونَ يَفْقَهُونَ حَدِيثاً,"(Wheresoever ye may be) O sincere believers, on land or on the sea, in settlement or travelling, (death will overtake you, even though ye were in lofty towers) in fortified towers. Allah then mentioned the saying of the Jews and hypocrites: “since Muhammad and his Companions came to us, our harvests and fields have kept ever decreasing”, saying: (Yet if a happy thing) land fertility, lower prices and continuous rain throughout the year (befalleth them) the Jews and hypocrites (they say: This is from Allah) for He knew that we were good; (and if an evil thing) drought, dearth, hardship and high prices (befalleth them they say: This is of your doing) this is because of the ill-omen of Muhammad and his Companions. (Say (unto them)) unto the Jews and hypocrites, O Muhammad: (All) hardship and blessing (is from Allah. What is amiss with these people) the Jews and hypocrites (that they come not nigh to understand a happening?) that both hardship and bounty are from Allah."
مَّآ أَصَابَكَ مِنْ حَسَنَةٍ فَمِنَ ٱللَّهِ وَمَآ أَصَابَكَ مِن سَيِّئَةٍ فَمِن نَّفْسِكَ وَأَرْسَلْنَاكَ لِلنَّاسِ رَسُولاً وَكَفَىٰ بِٱللَّهِ شَهِيداً,"Allah then mentioned that which brings bounty and hardship, saying: (Whatever of good) of land fertility, low prices and continuous rain throughout the year (befalleth thee) O Muhammad (it is from Allah) it is of Allah's bounty for you. Although Allah addressed Muhammad (pbuh) here it was his people who were meant by it, (and whatever of ill) drought, dearth and high prices (befalleth thee it is from yourself) it is because of the purity of yourself, in that He purifies you because of it; it is also said that the above means: whatever good befalls you, such as conquest and booty, it is from Allah, as an honour from Allah; and whatever bad happens, such as killing and defeat as was the case at Uhud, is due to the transgression of your Companions when they left their positions. It is also said that this means: whatever good you do is because of Allah's given success and help; and whatever evil you commit is due to the transgression of your soul and His having forsaken you. (We have sent thee (Muhammad) as a messenger) to convey the message (unto mankind) to the jinn and human beings (and Allah is sufficient as witness) of that which they say: whatever good befalls them is from Allah and whatever evil befalls them is due to the ill-omen of Muhammad (pbuh) and his companions. It is also said that this means: Allah is sufficient as witness for their saying: bring a witness to testify that you are a messenger from Allah."
مَّنْ يُطِعِ ٱلرَّسُولَ فَقَدْ أَطَاعَ ٱللَّهَ وَمَن تَوَلَّىٰ فَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَاكَ عَلَيْهِمْ حَفِيظاً,"When the verse (We sent no messenger save that he should be obeyed by Allah's leave) was revealed, 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy said: "" Muhammad commands us to obey him instead of obeying Allah "" , so Allah revealed the following: (Whoso obeyeth the messenger) in that which he commands (obeys Allah) because the Messenger never commands anything unless Allah has commanded it, (and whoso turneth away) from obeying the messenger: (We have not sent thee as a warder) a custodian (over them)."
وَيَقُولُونَ طَاعَةٌ فَإِذَا بَرَزُواْ مِنْ عِندِكَ بَيَّتَ طَآئِفَةٌ مِّنْهُمْ غَيْرَ ٱلَّذِي تَقُولُ وَٱللَّهُ يَكْتُبُ مَا يُبَيِّتُونَ فَأَعْرِضْ عَنْهُمْ وَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ وَكَفَىٰ بِٱللَّهِ وَكِيلاً,"(And they say) i.e. the hypocrites 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy and his followers: ((It is) obedience) your command is obeyed, O Muhammad. Command us with whatever you will and we shall comply; (but when they have gone forth from thee a party of them) of the hypocrites (spend the night in planning other than what thou sayest) what you command. (Allah recordeth what they plan by night) He records their planning to change your command. (So oppose them) but do not punish them (and put thy trust in Allah) rely on Allah regarding that which they are good for. (Allah is sufficient as Trustee) He is sufficient to give you triumph and sovereignty over them."
أَفَلاَ يَتَدَبَّرُونَ ٱلْقُرْآنَ وَلَوْ كَانَ مِنْ عِندِ غَيْرِ ٱللَّهِ لَوَجَدُواْ فِيهِ ٱخْتِلاَفاً كَثِيراً,(Will they not then ponder on the Qur'an?) do they not reflect on the Qur'an that its different parts are harmonious and support each other and it further contains that which the Prophet (pbuh) commands them? (If it had been from other than Allah) if this Qur'an had come from anyone other than Allah (they would have found therein much incongruity) much contradictions whereby its different parts are not harmonious.
وَإِذَا جَآءَهُمْ أَمْرٌ مِّنَ ٱلأَمْنِ أَوِ ٱلْخَوْفِ أَذَاعُواْ بِهِ وَلَوْ رَدُّوهُ إِلَى ٱلرَّسُولِ وَإِلَىٰ أُوْلِي ٱلأَمْرِ مِنْهُمْ لَعَلِمَهُ ٱلَّذِينَ يَسْتَنْبِطُونَهُ مِنْهُمْ وَلَوْلاَ فَضْلُ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ وَرَحْمَتُهُ لاَتَّبَعْتُمُ ٱلشَّيْطَانَ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً,"Allah then mentioned the betrayal of the hypocrites, saying: (And if any tidings whether of safety) any news about the army, conquest or booty, they insist on it out of resentful envy (or fear) and when they receive any news about the army, killings or defeat, (come unto them, they noise it abroad) they divulge it, (whereas if they had referred it) the news of the army (to the messenger) until the messenger informs them (and such of them as are in authority) those possessed of reason and understanding, i.e. Abu Bakr and his companions, (those among them who are able to think out the matter would have known it) i.e. the precise news. (If it had not been for the grace of Allah and His mercy) by means of His given success and protection (you would have followed Satan) all of you, (save a few (of you)) who would not divulge the news."
فَقَاتِلْ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ لاَ تُكَلَّفُ إِلاَّ نَفْسَكَ وَحَرِّضِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ عَسَى ٱللَّهُ أَن يَكُفَّ بَأْسَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَٱللَّهُ أَشَدُّ بَأْساً وَأَشَدُّ تَنكِيلاً,"Then Allah commanded His Prophet to engage in jihad in the way of Allah and proceed to the Lesser Badr, saying: (So fight (O Muhammad) in the way of Allah) in obedience of Allah. (Thou are not taxed) you are not commanded this (except for thyself and urge on the believers) to advance with you. (Peradventure Allah) peradventure when it is used in relation to Allah means that Allah will take it upon Himself (will restrain) will stop (the might) the fighting (of those who disbelieve) the unbelievers of Mecca. (Allah is stronger in might) in His torment (and stronger in inflicting punishment)."
مَّن يَشْفَعْ شَفَٰعَةً حَسَنَةً يَكُنْ لَّهُ نَصِيبٌ مِّنْهَا وَمَن يَشْفَعْ شَفَٰعَةً سَيِّئَةً يَكُنْ لَّهُ كِفْلٌ مِّنْهَا وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ مُّقِيتاً,"Allah then mentioned the reward of him who believes and the punishment of him who disbelieves, referring respectively to Abu Bakr and Abu Jahl, saying: (Whoso interveneth in a good cause) whoever helps to unite or reconcile two parties (will have the reward thereof) a reward of that good deed, (and whoso interveneth in an evil cause) who ascribes partners to Allah or acts as a tale-bearer (will bear the consequence thereof) will bear the onus of such an evil deed. (Allah overseeth all things) He rewards good and bad deeds; it is also said that this means: He oversees the sustenance of everyone: those who do good works as well as those who do evil."
وَإِذَا حُيِّيتُم بِتَحِيَّةٍ فَحَيُّواْ بِأَحْسَنَ مِنْهَآ أَوْ رُدُّوهَآ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ حَسِيباً,"(When ye are greeted with a greeting) when someone greets you with a greeting, (greet ye with a better than it) this is for those of your Religion and belief by adding to the formula of greeting (or return it) or return the exact greeting, if the one who greets you happens to be of another religion. (Lo! Allah taketh count of all things) of greeting and the return of greetings, just as He is a witness and will reward all. This verse was revealed about a group of people who refrained from returning greetings."
ٱللَّهُ لاۤ إِلَـٰهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ لَيَجْمَعَنَّكُمْ إِلَىٰ يَوْمِ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ لاَ رَيْبَ فِيهِ وَمَنْ أَصْدَقُ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ حَدِيثاً,"Allah then declared His divine Oneness, saying: (Allah! There is no God save Him. He gathers you all unto a Day of Resurrection) on the Day of Judgement (whereof there is no doubt. Who is more true in statement) in words (than Allah?)."
فَمَا لَكُمْ فِي ٱلْمُنَافِقِينَ فِئَتَيْنِ وَٱللَّهُ أَرْكَسَهُمْ بِمَا كَسَبُوۤاْ أَتُرِيدُونَ أَن تَهْدُواْ مَنْ أَضَلَّ ٱللَّهُ وَمَن يُضْلِلِ ٱللَّهُ فَلَن تَجِدَ لَهُ سَبِيلاً,"The following was revealed about ten hypocrites who left Islam and Medina for Mecca: (What aileth you) O group of believers (that you are become two parties) one party of the view that the hypocrites' wealth and blood are lawful and a party holding the opposite view (regarding the hypocrites) who abandoned Islam, (when Allah cast them back (to disbelief) because of what they earned) because of their hypocrisy and evil intentions? (Seek you to guide) to the religion of Allah (him whom Allah hath sent astray) from His religion? (He whom Allah sendeth astray) from His religion, (for him thou (O Muhammad) canst not find a road) you cannot find a religion or argument in their favour."
وَدُّواْ لَوْ تَكْفُرُونَ كَمَا كَفَرُواْ فَتَكُونُونَ سَوَآءً فَلاَ تَتَّخِذُواْ مِنْهُمْ أَوْلِيَآءَ حَتَّىٰ يُهَاجِرُواْ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ فَإِنْ تَوَلَّوْاْ فَخُذُوهُمْ وَٱقْتُلُوهُمْ حَيْثُ وَجَدتُّمُوهُمْ وَلاَ تَتَّخِذُواْ مِنْهُمْ وَلِيّاً وَلاَ نَصِيراً,"(They long that you should disbelieve) in Muhammad and the Qur'an (even as they disbelieve, that ye may be upon a level (with them)) in following idolatry. (So choose not friends from them) in religion or for seeking assistance and backing (till they forsake their homes) until they believe again and migrate (in the way of Allah) in obedience of Allah; (if they turn back) from faith and migration (then take them) as prisoners (and kill them wherever you find them) in the Sacred Precinct or anywhere else, (and choose no friend) in religion or for seeking assistance and backing (nor helper) a protector (from among them),"

(Had Allah willed He could have given them power over you) i.e. the people of Hilal Ibn 'Uwaymir (so that assuredly they would have fought you) together with their people upon the conquest of Mecca. (So, if they hold aloof from you and wage not war against you) upon the conquest of Mecca (and offer you peace) they submit to you through peace and honouring the pact they made, (Allah alloweth you no way against them) He does not give you any excuse for killing them."
سَتَجِدُونَ آخَرِينَ يُرِيدُونَ أَن يَأْمَنُوكُمْ وَيَأْمَنُواْ قَوْمَهُمْ كُلَّ مَا رُدُّوۤاْ إِلَى ٱلْفِتْنِةِ أُرْكِسُواْ فِيِهَا فَإِن لَّمْ يَعْتَزِلُوكُمْ وَيُلْقُوۤاْ إِلَيْكُمُ ٱلسَّلَمَ وَيَكُفُّوۤاْ أَيْدِيَهُمْ فَخُذُوهُمْ وَٱقْتُلُوهُمْ حَيْثُ ثَقِفْتُمُوهُمْ وَأُوْلَـٰئِكُمْ جَعَلْنَا لَكُمْ عَلَيْهِمْ سُلْطَاناً مُّبِيناً,"(You will find others) other than the people of Hilal, Asad and Ghatafan for example (who desire that they should have security from you) they desire that their persons and wealth and families be safe from you by the declaration of “there is no god but Allah”, (and security from their own folk) and desire to be safe from their clan by adhering to disbelief. (So often as they are returned to hostility) to idolatry (they are plunged therein) they revert to it. (If they keep not aloof from you) upon the conquest of Mecca (nor offer you peace) nor submit to you by means of a treaty (nor hold their hands) from fighting you upon the conquest of Mecca, (then take them) as prisoners (and kill them wherever you find them) in the Sacred Precinct or anywhere else. (Against such) i.e. Asad and Ghatafan (We have given you clear warrant) to kill them."
وَمَا كَانَ لِمُؤْمِنٍ أَن يَقْتُلَ مُؤْمِناً إِلاَّ خَطَئاً وَمَن قَتَلَ مُؤْمِناً خَطَئاً فَتَحْرِيرُ رَقَبَةٍ مُّؤْمِنَةٍ وَدِيَةٌ مُّسَلَّمَةٌ إِلَىٰ أَهْلِهِ إِلاَّ أَن يَصَّدَّقُواْ فَإِن كَانَ مِن قَوْمٍ عَدُوٍّ لَّكُمْ وَهُوَ مُؤْمِنٌ فَتَحْرِيرُ رَقَبَةٍ مُّؤْمِنَةٍ وَإِن كَانَ مِن قَوْمٍ بَيْنَكُمْ وَبَيْنَهُمْ مِّيثَٰقٌ فَدِيَةٌ مُّسَلَّمَةٌ إِلَىۤ أَهْلِهِ وَتَحْرِيرُ رَقَبَةٍ مُّؤْمِنَةٍ فَمَن لَّمْ يَجِدْ فَصِيَامُ شَهْرَيْنِ مُتَتَابِعَيْنِ تَوْبَةً مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ عَلِيماً حَكِيماً,"(It is not for a believer) it is not allowed for a believer, meaning here 'Ayyash Ibn Abi Rabi'ah (to kill a believer) Harith Ibn Zayd ((unless (it be) by mistake) even if it be by mistake. (He who hath killed a believer by mistake must set free a believing slave) a slave who believes in Allah and His Messenger, (and pay the blood money) in full (to the family of the slain) to the next of kin of the victim who have the right to demand retaliation, (unless they remit it as a charity) unless the next of kin of the victim remit the blood money to the killer as a charity. (If he) the victim (be of a people hostile unto you) who are at war with you, (and he) i.e. the victim (is a believer, then (the penance is) to set free a believing slave) the killer should set free a slave who believes in Allah and His Messenger and so does not have to pay the blood money. Harith belonged to a people who were at war with the Messenger of Allah (pbuh). (And if he) the victim (cometh of a folk between whom and you there is a covenant) a treaty and peace, (then the blood money must be paid) in full (unto his folk) to the next of kin of the victim (and (also) a believing slave must be set free) a slave who believes in the divine Oneness of Allah. (And whoso hath not the wherewithal) to set free a believing slave (must fast two consecutive months) continuously. (A penance from Allah) if he does this, Allah will forgive him for killing a believer by mistake. (Allah is Knower) of him who kills by mistake, (Wise) in that which he ought to do."
وَمَن يَقْتُلْ مُؤْمِناً مُّتَعَمِّداً فَجَزَآؤُهُ جَهَنَّمُ خَٰلِداً فِيهَا وَغَضِبَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَلَعَنَهُ وَأَعَدَّ لَهُ عَذَاباً عَظِيماً,"Then Allah revealed about Miqyas Ibn Sababah, the killer of al-Fihri, the emissary of Allah's Messenger (pbuh) who, after taking the blood money for the killing of his brother Hisham Ibn Sababah, left Islam and fled to Mecca, saying: (Whoso slayeth a believer of set purpose, his reward is hell) for this wilful killing (for ever) due to his idolatry. (Allah is wroth against him) for taking the blood money (and He hath cursed him) because he killed a person who did not kill his brother (and prepared for him an awful doom) because of his boldness towards Allah."
يَٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ إِذَا ضَرَبْتُمْ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ فَتَبَيَّنُواْ وَلاَ تَقُولُواْ لِمَنْ أَلْقَىۤ إِلَيْكُمُ ٱلسَّلاَمَ لَسْتَ مُؤْمِناً تَبْتَغُونَ عَرَضَ ٱلْحَيَٰوةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا فَعِنْدَ ٱللَّهِ مَغَانِمُ كَثِيرَةٌ كَذٰلِكَ كُنْتُمْ مِّن قَبْلُ فَمَنَّ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْكُمْ فَتَبَيَّنُواْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيراً,"Then Allah revealed about Usamah Ibn Zayd who killed Mirdas Ibn Nuhayk al-Farari, a fellow believer, saying: (O ye who believe! When ye go forth (to fight) in the way of Allah) in jihad, (be careful to discriminate) between who is a believer and who is an unbeliever, (and say not unto one who offereth you peace) he who greets you and says to you “there is no god but Allah, Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah”: (“Thou art not a believer”;) and then kill him (seeking the chance profits of this life) so that you may despoil him. (With Allah are plenteous spoils) He has with Him a tremendous reward for him who avoids killing a fellow believer. (Even thus (as he now is) were ye before) with your people feeling safe with the believers and with Muhammad (pbuh) and his Companions because of the attestation of “there is no god but Allah and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah”, before the Emigration; (but Allah hath since then been gracious unto you) by migrating from the unbelievers. (Therefore take care to discriminate) such that you do not kill believers. (Allah is ever informed of what ye do) whether it is killing someone or other things."

Allah hath conferred on those who strive with their wealth and lives a rank) a merit (above the sedentary) who do not have any disabling hurt. (Unto each) those who engage in jihad and those who do not (Allah hath promised good) Paradise due to their faith, (but He hath bestowed on those who strive) those who engage in jihad in his way (a great reward) an abundant reward in Paradise (above the sedentary) who do not have any disabling hurt;"
دَرَجَاتٍ مِّنْهُ وَمَغْفِرَةً وَرَحْمَةً وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ غَفُوراً رَّحِيماً,"(Degrees of rank from Him) merits from Allah in bestowing different ranks, (and forgiveness) of sins (and mercy) that saves one from torment. (Allah is ever Forgiving) of those who repent of staying back and who goes out on jihad, (Merciful) towards him who dies in a state of repentance."
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ تَوَفَّاهُمُ ٱلْمَلاۤئِكَةُ ظَالِمِيۤ أَنْفُسِهِمْ قَالُواْ فِيمَ كُنتُمْ قَالُواْ كُنَّا مُسْتَضْعَفِينَ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ قَالْوۤاْ أَلَمْ تَكُنْ أَرْضُ ٱللَّهِ وَاسِعَةً فَتُهَاجِرُواْ فِيهَا فَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ مَأْوَاهُمْ جَهَنَّمُ وَسَآءَتْ مَصِيراً,"Then, Allah revealed the following about the 50 people who had left Islam and were all killed during the Battle of Badr, saying: (Lo! as for those whom the angels take (in death)) at the Battle of Badr (while they wrong themselves) by being idolaters, ((the angels) will ask) upon taking their souls: (In what were you engaged) what were you doing in Mecca? (They will say: We were oppressed) and humiliated (in the land) in Mecca at the hands of the unbelievers. ((The angels) will say: Was not Allah's earth) Medina (spacious) safe (that ye could have migrated therein? As for such) group of people, (their habitation) their dwelling (will be hell, an evil journey's end) they will come to;"
إِلاَّ ٱلْمُسْتَضْعَفِينَ مِنَ ٱلرِّجَالِ وَٱلنِّسَآءِ وَٱلْوِلْدَانِ لاَ يَسْتَطِيعُونَ حِيلَةً وَلاَ يَهْتَدُونَ سَبِيلاً,"Allah then showed who had an excuse, saying: (Except the feeble among men) the elderly and the weak, (and the women, and the children, who are unable to devise a plan) for leaving Mecca (and are not shown a way) they do not know how to leave."
فَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ عَسَى ٱللَّهُ أَن يَعْفُوَ عَنْهُمْ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ عَفُوّاً غَفُوراً,"(As for such, it may be) it is a requisite (that Allah will pardon them) that which ensues from them. (Allah is ever Clement) towards the likes of these, (Forgiving) of those who repent amongst them."
وَمَن يُهَاجِرْ فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ يَجِدْ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ مُرَٰغَماً كَثِيراً وَسَعَةً وَمَن يَخْرُجْ مِن بَيْتِهِ مُهَاجِراً إِلَى ٱللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ ثُمَّ يُدْرِكْهُ ٱلْمَوْتُ فَقَدْ وَقَعَ أَجْرُهُ عَلىَ ٱللَّهِ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ غَفُوراً رَّحِيماً,"(Whoso migrateth for the cause of Allah) in obedience of Allah (will find much refuge) and a sanctuary (and abundance) of means of living and safety (in the earth) in Medina. This was revealed about Aktham Ibn Sayfi and again about Jundu' Ibn Damura, an old man who lived in Mecca and who migrated from the latter to Medina but died in al-Tan'im. His reward is the same as the reward of those who made it to Mecca, and so he died with his endeavour highly praised. Allah said in this context: (and whoso forsaketh his home) in Mecca, (a fugitive unto Allah) unto the obedience of Allah (and His messenger) and unto His Messenger in Medina, (and death overtaketh him) at al-Tan'im, (his reward) the reward of his migration (is then incumbent on Allah. Allah is ever Forgiving) of his past idolatry, (Merciful) regarding that which ensued from him in Islam."

(In truth the disbelievers are an open enemy to you) this is what is called the prayer of fear (salat al-khawf)."

Then when they have performed their prostrations) when they have prayed one unit (let them fall) let them retreat (to the rear) to the position of their fellow believers who are facing the enemy (and let another party) who were facing the enemy (come that hath not worshipped) that has not performed the first unit of prayer with you (and let them worship with thee) let them pray with you the second unit of prayer, (and let them take their precaution) against the enemy (and their arms) let them take their arms with them. (Those who disbelieve) i.e. the Banu Anmar (long for you to neglect your arms) and be oblivious to them (and your baggage) and they also long that you forget the means of war (that they may attack you once for all) while you are performing the prayers. Then Allah gave the believers a legal dispensation to put down their arms, saying: (It is no sin for you) there is no harm for you (to lay aside your arms, if rain) intense rain (impedeth you or ye are sick) wounded. (But take your precaution) against your enemy. (Lo! Allah prepareth for the disbelievers) the Banu Anmar (shameful punishment) by means of which they will be humiliated; it is also said that this means: a severe punishment."

(And when ye are in safety) when you return home and feel no more fear, (observe proper worship) perform the prayer in full: four units of prayer. (Worship at fixed hours hath been) performing the prayer is (enjoined on the believers) prescribed and known both while in residence and during travel: the traveller performs two units of prayer and the resident four."
وَلاَ تَهِنُواْ فِي ٱبْتِغَآءِ ٱلْقَوْمِ إِن تَكُونُواْ تَأْلَمُونَ فَإِنَّهُمْ يَأْلَمُونَ كَمَا تَأْلَمونَ وَتَرْجُونَ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ مَا لاَ يَرْجُونَ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ عَلِيماً حَكِيماً,"Allah then encouraged the believers to go in pursuit of Abu Sufyan and his men after the Day of Uhud, saying: (Relent not) do not slacken or weaken (in pursuit of the enemy) Abu Sufyan and his men. (If ye are suffering) from your wounds, (lo! they suffer) from their wounds (even as ye suffer and ye hope from Allah) His reward and fear His torment (that for which they cannot hope. Allah is ever Knower) of your wounds, (Wise) He enjoined upon you to go in pursuit of these people."

(Peace) such that the wife is pleased (is better) than transgression and aversion. (But greed hath been made present in the minds) souls are naturally inclined to be parsimonious, such that the wife withholds the share of her husband; it is also said that this means: her greed drives her to be pleased.

This verse was revealed regarding 'Abdullah Ibn Salam, Asad and Usayd the sons of Ka'b, Tha'labah Ibn Qays and Salam and Salamah, the nephews of 'Abdullah Ibn Salam, and Yamin Ibn Yamin. These were the believers from among the people of the Torah. It was said about them: O you who believe in Moses and the Torah, believe in Allah and His Messenger Muhammad (and the Scripture which He hath revealed unto His messenger) Muhammad, i.e. the Qur'an, (and the Scripture which He revealed aforetime) before Muhammad and the Qur'an upon all past prophets.

Those are with the believers) they are with the believers inwardly; it is also said that this means that they are with them as far as the promise is concerned; and it is also said that this means that they are with the believers both inwardly and outwardly; and it is said that they are with the believers in Paradise.

This verse was revealed about Abu Bakr who was verbally abused by a man."
إِن تُبْدُواْ خَيْراً أَوْ تُخْفُوهُ أَوْ تَعْفُواْ عَن سُوۤءٍ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ عَفُوّاً قَدِيراً,"(If ye do good) if you answer in a good manner (openly or keep it secret) and not be contemptuous, (or forgive evil) or overlook a transgression, (lo! Allah is Forgiving) of the person who has been wronged, (Powerful) to punish the transgressor."

(They asked a greater thing of Moses aforetime) greater than what they have asked you, (for they said: Show us Allah plainly) such that they could see Him with their own eyes. (The storm of lightning seized them) the Fire burnt them (for their wickedness) for their rejection of Moses and their boldness vis-à-vis Allah. (Then (even after that) they chose the calf) they worshipped the calf (after clear proofs) commands and prohibitions (had come unto them. And We forgave them that!)

Do not exaggerate) do not be extreme (in your religion) for this is not the right course (nor utter aught concerning Allah save the Truth. The Messiah, Jesus son of Mary, was only a messenger of Allah, and His word which He conveyed unto Mary) and through His word he became a created being, (and a spirit from Him) and through His command, Jesus became a son without a father. (So believe in Allah and His messengers) all the messengers including Jesus, (and say not “Three”) a son, father and wife. (Cease!) from making such a claim and repent ((it is) better for you!) than such a claim. (Allah is only One God) without a son or partner. (Far is it removed from His Transcendent Majesty that he should have a son. His is all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth) are His servants. (And Allah is sufficient as Defender) as Lord of all created beings and He is witness of what He says about Jesus."

This was revealed in respect of the Christians saying to the Prophet: “O Muhammad, what you say of Jesus is shameful”. Allah said to them: it is not shameful that Jesus be the servant of Allah, (nor will the favoured angels) nor would the favoured angels, the carriers of the Throne, ever not acknowledge that they are servants of Allah. (Whoso scorneth His service) whoever scorns to acknowledge that being his servant (and is proud) is too proud to believe in Allah, (all such) believers and unbelievers (will He assemble unto Him) on the Day of Judgement."

This verse was revealed about Jabir Ibn 'Abdullah al-Ansari who asked the Prophet (pbuh): I have a sister. What do I inherit from her if she dies? So Allah said: they ask you, O Muhammad, about the inheritance of al-Kalalah (Say: Allah hath pronounced for you) Allah clarifies for you (concerning distant kindred) concerning the inheritance of al-Kalalah which is anyone other than the father and the son. He said: (If a man dies childless) and his father is also deceased (and he has a sister) a full sister, or half sister from his father's side, (hers is half the heritage) left by the deceased person, (and he would have inherited from her had she died childless) without sons or daughters. (And if there be two sisters) full sisters or half sisters from the father's side, (then theirs are two-thirds of the heritage) that the deceased person has left behind, (and if they be brethren, men and women) male or female, full siblings or half siblings from the father, (unto the male is the equivalent of the share of two females. Allah expoundeth unto you) the division of estates, (so that ye err not) in the division of estates. (Allah is Knower of all things) of the divisions of estates and other things'."

Fulfil your undertakings): '(O ye who believe! Fulfil your undertakings) fulfil the pledges that are between you and Allah or between you and other people; it is also said that this means: fulfil the obligations which have been made obligatory upon you and which you accepted on the Day of the Covenant and in this Book. (The beast of cattle is made lawful unto you (for food)) you have a legal dispensation to eat of the meat of game such as wild oxen, wild camels and gazelles (except that which is announced unto you) except that which is recited to you in this surah, (game being unlawful when ye are on pilgrimage) or in the Sacred Precinct.

It is also said that this means: they seek provision by means of trade and also Allah's pleasure.

حُرِّمَتْ عَلَيْكُمُ ٱلْمَيْتَةُ وَٱلْدَّمُ وَلَحْمُ ٱلْخِنْزِيرِ وَمَآ أُهِلَّ لِغَيْرِ ٱللَّهِ بِهِ وَٱلْمُنْخَنِقَةُ وَٱلْمَوْقُوذَةُ وَٱلْمُتَرَدِّيَةُ وَٱلنَّطِيحَةُ وَمَآ أَكَلَ ٱلسَّبُعُ إِلاَّ مَا ذَكَّيْتُمْ وَمَا ذُبِحَ عَلَى ٱلنُّصُبِ وَأَنْ تَسْتَقْسِمُواْ بِٱلأَزْلاَمِ ذٰلِكُمْ فِسْقٌ ٱلْيَوْمَ يَئِسَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِن دِينِكُمْ فَلاَ تَخْشَوْهُمْ وَٱخْشَوْنِ ٱلْيَوْمَ أَكْمَلْتُ لَكُمْ دِينَكُمْ وَأَتْمَمْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ نِعْمَتِي وَرَضِيتُ لَكُمُ ٱلإِسْلٰمَ دِيناً فَمَنِ ٱضْطُرَّ فِي مَخْمَصَةٍ غَيْرَ مُتَجَانِفٍ لإِثْمٍ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"Allah then explained what He made unlawful for them, saying: (Forbidden unto you (for food) are carrion) He says: eating carrion is forbidden for you because He has commanded that it be immolated (and blood) which is shed (and swine flesh, and that which hath been dedicated unto any other than Allah) in purpose, (and the strangled) that which is strangled with a rope until it dies, (and the dead through beating) the beast beaten by a piece of wood until it dies, (and the dead through falling from a height) or in a well and which dies as a consequence, (and that which has been killed by (the goring of) horns, and the devoured of wild beasts) as a prey, (saving that which ye make lawful) except that which you find on the verge of dying and make it lawful by immolating it, (and that which hath been immolated unto idols. And (forbidden is it) that you swear by the divining arrows) He says: He has forbidden your use of divining arrows. They were in the habit of writing on some arrows: "" My Lord commands me "" , and on others "" My Lord forbids me "" and then use the divination method associated with it to decide their affairs, and so Allah prohibited them from engaging in such activity. (This) that which I have mentioned to you of transgressions and the unlawful (is an abomination) engaging in them is an abomination and declaring them lawful is an act of disbelief. (This day) the day of the greater pilgrimage, the farewell pilgrimage (are those who disbelieve) the unbelievers of Mecca (in despair of your religion) in despair of you religion reverting to theirs after you left their religion and its laws; (so fear them not) in relation to following the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) and opposing them (fear Me!) if you abstain from following Muhammad and his religion and follow them. (This day) the day of the pilgrimage (have I perfected your religion for you) I have elucidated to you the prescriptions of your religion: the lawful and the unlawful, the commands and the prohibitions (and completed My favour unto you) I have completed My blessing upon you in that, after today, no idolater will ever gather with you in 'Arafat, Mina, in the circumambulation around the Ka'bah, and in the coming and going between al-Safa and al-Marwah, (and have chosen for you as religion al-Islam."

(Say: (all) good things) all the immolated ones (are made lawful for you. And those beasts and birds of prey which ye have trained as hounds are trained, ye teach them) to abstain from eating game (that which Allah taught you) as Allah has taught you; (so eat of that which they) the trained dogs (catch for you and mention Allah's name upon it) upon immolating your game; and it is also said: upon sending the trained dogs upon the game, (and observe your duty to Allah) fear Allah about eating the meat of carrion. (Lo! Allah is swift to take account) His punishment is severe; it is also said that this means: when He is swift when He takes people to task."

The food) the animals immolated (of those who have received the Scripture is lawful for you) as long as it is not prohibited, (and your food) your immolated animals (is lawful for them) both the Jews and Christians can consume that which the Muslims immolate. (And so are the) free (virtuous women of the believers) are lawful for you to marry (and the virtuous women of those who received the Scripture before you) lawful for you to marry (when ye give them their marriage portions) their dowry, in surplus of the price given to the prostitute in exchange for sex (and live with them in honour) in wedlock, (not in) flagrant (fornication, nor taking them as secret concubines.) This was revealed about the women of Mecca when they boasted to the women of Medina. Allah said: (Whoso denieth the faith) Allah's divine Oneness, (his work is vain) in this world (and he will be among the losers in the Hereafter) he will be of those who have been duped since he will be deprived of Paradise and enter hell."

And if ye are unclean) if you are in a state of major ritual impurity, (purify yourselves) with water. (And if ye are sick) of smallpox or are wounded. This was revealed about 'Abdullah Ibn 'Awf (or on a journey, or one of you cometh from the closet) or one of you has urinated or defecated, (or ye have had (sexual) contact with women) or had sex with women, (and ye find not water) you are unable to use water, (then go to clean, high ground and rub your faces) with the first blow (and your hands) with the second blow (with some of it) i.e. some of the dust.

(So grieve not over) do not be saddened about (the wrong-doing folk)."
وَٱتْلُ عَلَيْهِمْ نَبَأَ ٱبْنَيْ ءَادَمَ بِٱلْحَقِّ إِذْ قَرَّبَا قُرْبَاناً فَتُقُبِّلَ مِن أَحَدِهِمَا وَلَمْ يُتَقَبَّلْ مِنَ ٱلآخَرِ قَالَ لأَقْتُلَنَّكَ قَالَ إِنَّمَا يَتَقَبَّلُ ٱللَّهُ مِنَ ٱلْمُتَّقِينَ,"(But recite unto them) O Muhammad (with truth) with the Qur'an (the tale of the two sons of Adam, how they offered each a sacrifice, and it was accepted from the one) Abel (of them and it was not accepted from the other) Cain. ((The one)) Cain (said) to Abel: (I will surely kill thee) O Abel. ((The other) answered) why? Because Allah has accepted your offering and rejected mine. And Abel said: (Allah accepteth only from those who ward off (evil)) the sincere in their speech and action, whose hearts are pure, and your heart is not pure."

(Our messengers came unto them) i.e. the Children of Israel (of old with clear proofs) with commands, prohibitions and signs, (but afterwards lo! many of them) the Children of Israel (became) after the messengers (prodigals in the earth) ascribing partners to Allah."

This group wanted to emigrate to Medina to see Allah's Messenger (pbuh) and declare their Islam. However, they were all killed and their belongings taken as booty. Hence, Allah explained the punishment of the people of the Banu Hilal, who were idolaters, saying: (The only reward) requital (of those who make war upon Allah and His messenger) of those who disbelieve in Allah and His messenger (and strive after corruption in the land) and engage in sin in the land, i.e. by wrongfully killing others and taking their properties (will be that they will be killed) He says: the punishment of one who kills and does not take the victim's property is that he be killed (or crucified) He says: the punishment of one who kills a person and also takes his property is that he be crucified, (or have their hands and feet on alternate sides cut off) the right hand and the left leg. He says: the punishment of one who takes another's property but does not kill is that his hand and leg be cut off, (or will be expelled out of the land) or he will be put in prison until he displays righteousness and his repentance becomes apparent. Allah says: the punishment of someone who terrorises people as a highway robber but does not kill or take anyone's property is that he be imprisoned. (Such) that which I have mentioned (will be their degradation) their punishment (in the world, and in the Hereafter theirs will be an awful doom) more severe than their punishment which they suffered in this world, that is, if the person does not repent;"

(For know that Allah is Forgiving) He pardons, (Merciful) towards him who repents."
يَا أَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ ٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَٱبْتَغُوۤاْ إِلَيهِ ٱلْوَسِيلَةَ وَجَاهِدُواْ فِي سَبِيلِهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ,"(O ye who believe!) in Muhammad and the Qur'an (Be mindful of your duty to Allah) regarding that which He has commanded you, (and seek the way of approach unto Him) seek the highest rank; it is also said that this means: seek with Him high degrees through righteous works, (and strive in His way) in His obedience (in order that ye may succeed) so that you escape His wrath and torment and so that you attain to faith."

Theirs will be a painful doom)."

(It is the reward of their own deeds) as a punishment for their theft, (an exemplary punishment from Allah) a disgrace for them from Allah. (Allah is Mighty) in showing His anger towards the thief, (Wise) in that He decreed for him the cutting off of his hand."

لَتَجِدَنَّ أَشَدَّ ٱلنَّاسِ عَدَاوَةً لِّلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ ٱلْيَهُودَ وَٱلَّذِينَ أَشْرَكُواْ وَلَتَجِدَنَّ أَقْرَبَهُمْ مَّوَدَّةً لِّلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ ٱلَّذِينَ قَالُوۤاْ إِنَّا نَصَارَىٰ ذٰلِكَ بِأَنَّ مِنْهُمْ قِسِّيسِينَ وَرُهْبَاناً وَأَنَّهُمْ لاَ يَسْتَكْبِرُونَ,"Allah then showed their enmity towards the Prophet (pbuh) and his Companions, saying: (Thou wilt find) O Muhammad (the most vehement of mankind in hostility) and most vile in speech (to those who believe) Muhammad and his Companions ((to be) the Jews) the Jews of the Banu Qurayzah, Banu'l-Nadir, Fadak and Khaybar (and the idolaters) and the most vehement in hostility to the believers among the idolaters are the idolaters of Mecca. (And thou wilt find the nearest of them in affection) in their bond and most lenient in speech (to those who believe) Muhammad and his Companions ((to be) those who say: Lo! We are Christians) the Negus and his followers who were 32 men; it is also said that they were 40 people in total: 32 from Abyssinia, and eight monks from Historic Syria: the monk Bahirah and his followers Abrahah, Ashraf, Idris, Tamim, Tammam, Durayd and Ayman. (That) affection (is because there are among them priests) ascetics whose heads are shaved in the middle (and monks) secluded in monasteries who are their men of knowledge, (and because they are not proud) in believing in Muhammad and the Qur'an."
وَإِذَا سَمِعُواْ مَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَى ٱلرَّسُولِ تَرَىۤ أَعْيُنَهُمْ تَفِيضُ مِنَ ٱلدَّمْعِ مِمَّا عَرَفُواْ مِنَ ٱلْحَقِّ يَقُولُونَ رَبَّنَآ آمَنَّا فَٱكْتُبْنَا مَعَ ٱلشَّاهِدِينَ,"(When they listen to that which hath been revealed unto the messenger) when they hear Ja'far Ibn Abi Talib's recitation of what has been revealed to the messenger, (thou seest their eyes overflow with tears because of their recognition of the Truth) their recognition of the traits and description of Muhammad (pbuh) in their Scripture. (They say: Our Lord) O our Lord, (we believe) in You, in Your Book and in Your Messenger Muhammad. (Inscribe us as among the witnesses) make us of the Community of Muhammad (pbuh) who believe."
وَمَا لَنَا لاَ نُؤْمِنُ بِٱللَّهِ وَمَا جَآءَنَا مِنَ ٱلْحَقِّ وَنَطْمَعُ أَن يُدْخِلَنَا رَبُّنَا مَعَ ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلصَّالِحِينَ,"When their own people blamed them for believing, they said: (How should we not believe in Allah and that which hath come unto us of the Truth) He says: and also believe in the Truth that has come to us from Scripture and the Messenger. (And (how should we not) hope that our Lord will) in the Hereafter in Paradise (bring us in along with righteous folk) the righteous among the Community of Muhammad (pbuh)?"
فَأَثَابَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ بِمَا قَالُواْ جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلأَنْهَارُ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا وَذٰلِكَ جَزَآءُ ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,"(Allah hath rewarded them) has decreed for them (for that their saying) for declaring their faith voluntarily. (Gardens beneath which) beneath its trees and habitation (rivers) of water, milk, wine and honey (flow, wherein they will abide for ever) remaining in Paradise for ever, never to die or be removed from it. (That) which I have mentioned (is the reward of the good) who testify to Allah's divine Oneness; it is also said that the good means those who are kind in speech and action."
وَٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَكَذَّبُواْ بِآيَٰتِنَآ أُوْلَـۤئِكَ أَصْحَٰبُ ٱلْجَحِيمِ,"(But those who disbelieve) in Allah (and deny Our revelations) Muhammad and the Qur'an, (they are owners of hellfire) they are the folk of hell."
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ لاَ تُحَرِّمُواْ طَيِّبَاتِ مَآ أَحَلَّ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمْ وَلاَ تَعْتَدُوۤاْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لاَ يُحِبُّ ٱلْمُعْتَدِينَ,"(O ye who believe! Forbid not the good things which Allah hath made lawful for you) this verse was revealed about ten Companions of the Prophet (pbuh) among them were Abu Bakr, 'Umar, 'Ali, 'Abdullah Ibn Mas'ud, 'Uthman Ibn Maz'un al-Jumahi, Miqdad Ibn al-Aswad al-Kindi, and Salim the client of Abu Hudhayfah Ibn 'Utbah, Salman al-Farisi, Abu Dharr, 'Ammar Ibn Yasir-these Companions vowed in the house of 'Uthman Ibn Maz'un that they would not eat or drink except that which was enough to keep them alive, that they would not have sex with their wives, that they would never eat meat or fat and that they would cut off their male organs. But Allah forbade them from such acts, and revealed about them: do not forbid the lawful things that Allah has permitted such as foods, drinks and having sex with your wives (and transgress not) by cutting off your male organs. (Lo! Allah loveth not transgressors) who move from the lawful to the unlawful by mutilating themselves."
وَكُلُواْ مِمَّا رَزَقَكُمُ ٱللَّهُ حَلَـٰلاً طَيِّباً وَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ ٱلَّذِيۤ أَنتُم بِهِ مُؤْمِنُونَ,"(Eat of that which Allah hath bestowed on you as food lawful and good, and keep your duty to Allah in Whom ye are believers) fear Allah regarding mutilation and forbidding that which He has made lawful."
لاَ يُؤَاخِذُكُمُ ٱللَّهُ بِٱللَّغْوِ فِيۤ أَيْمَانِكُمْ وَلَـٰكِن يُؤَاخِذُكُم بِمَا عَقَّدتُّمُ ٱلأَيْمَانَ فَكَفَّارَتُهُ إِطْعَامُ عَشَرَةِ مَسَاكِينَ مِنْ أَوْسَطِ مَا تُطْعِمُونَ أَهْلِيكُمْ أَوْ كِسْوَتُهُمْ أَوْ تَحْرِيرُ رَقَبَةٍ فَمَن لَّمْ يَجِدْ فَصِيَامُ ثَلاَثَةِ أَيَّامٍ ذٰلِكَ كَفَّارَةُ أَيْمَانِكُمْ إِذَا حَلَفْتُمْ وَٱحْفَظُوۤاْ أَيْمَانَكُمْ كَذٰلِكَ يُبَيِّنُ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمْ آيَاتِهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ,"(Allah will not take you to task for that which is unintentional in your oaths) Allah does not take you to task for the expiation of unintentional oaths, (but He will take you to task for the oaths which ye swear in earnest) He takes you to task for the intention of your hearts when you make oaths. (The expiation thereof) the expiation of the oath which is not unintentional (is the feeding of ten of the needy with the average of that wherewith ye feed your own folk) of bread and seasoning which you feed to them at lunch and dinner, (or the clothing of them) or the clothing of ten needy people whereby their nudity is covered: a shawl, a gown or a loin cloth, (or the liberation of a slave) whichever it is of these three options, (and for him who finds not (the wherewithal to do so)) any one of these three options (then a three day fast) consecutively. (This) which I have mentioned (is the expiation of your oaths when ye have sworn) and do not honour your oath; (and keep your oaths) the uttering of your oaths as well as the expiation of your oaths. (Thus Allah expoundeth unto you His revelations) His commands and prohibitions, as He expounds the expiation of oaths (in order that ye may give thanks) in order that you may show gratitude for expositing His commands and prohibitions."
يَٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ إِنَّمَا ٱلْخَمْرُ وَٱلْمَيْسِرُ وَٱلأَنصَابُ وَٱلأَزْلاَمُ رِجْسٌ مِّنْ عَمَلِ ٱلشَّيْطَانِ فَٱجْتَنِبُوهُ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ,(O ye who believe! Strong drink) which intoxicates the mind (and games of chance) all types of games of chance (and idols) the worship of idols (and divining arrows are only an infamy of Satan's handiwork) they are unlawful because they are instigated by order of the devil and his whispering. (Leave it aside) avoid it (in order that ye may succeed) in order that you may escape Allah's anger and punishment and be safe in the Hereafter.
إِنَّمَا يُرِيدُ ٱلشَّيْطَانُ أَن يُوقِعَ بَيْنَكُمُ ٱلْعَدَاوَةَ وَٱلْبَغْضَآءَ فِي ٱلْخَمْرِ وَٱلْمَيْسِرِ وَيَصُدَّكُمْ عَن ذِكْرِ ٱللَّهِ وَعَنِ ٱلصَّلاَةِ فَهَلْ أَنْتُمْ مُّنتَهُونَ,"(Satan seeketh only to cast among you enmity and hatred by means of strong drink) when you become drunk (and games of chance) when you loose your money, (and to turn you from remembrance of Allah) He says: intoxicants drive you from the obedience of Allah (and from (His) worship) He says: it also prevents you from performing the five daily prayers. (Will ye then have done?) will you then stop from indulging in them."
وَأَطِيعُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَأَطِيعُواْ ٱلرَّسُولَ وَٱحْذَرُواْ فَإِن تَوَلَّيْتُمْ فَٱعْلَمُوۤاْ أَنَّمَا عَلَىٰ رَسُولِنَا ٱلْبَلاَغُ ٱلْمُبِينُ,"(Obey Allah and obey the messenger) regarding the prohibition of intoxicant drinks, (and beware!) of declaring them lawful or of drinking them. (But if ye turn away) from obeying them in relation to the prohibition of intoxicant drinks, (then know that the duty of Our messenger) Muhammad (is only plain) i.e. in a language that you understand (conveyance (of the message)) on behalf of Allah."
لَيْسَ عَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ جُنَاحٌ فِيمَا طَعِمُوۤاْ إِذَا مَا ٱتَّقَواْ وَآمَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّالِحَاتِ ثُمَّ اتَّقَواْ وَآمَنُواْ ثُمَّ اتَّقَواْ وَّأَحْسَنُواْ وَٱللَّهُ يُحِبُّ ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,"Then Allah revealed about a group of men from the Emigrants and the Helpers who asked the Prophet (pbuh): “what shall happen to those of us who died drinking intoxicant drinks before they were made unlawful”, saying: (There shall be no sin (imputed) unto those who believe) in Muhammad and the Qur'an (and do good works) that is between them and their Lord (for what they may have eaten (in the past)) for what they have drunk in the past before intoxicants were made unlawful, whether those who did it are dead or still living. (So be mindful of your duty (to Allah)) if they warded off disbelief, idolatry and indecencies, (and do good works) that is between them and their Lord; (and again: be mindful of your duty) ward off making intoxicants lawful after they were made unlawful; this address is to the believers who are still living, (and believe) in the unlawfulness of intoxicant; (and once again: be mindful of your duty) ward off drinking it, (and do right) leave the drinking of it. (Allah loveth the good) for avoiding drinking intoxicants; this relates to those who were still alive and who drunk intoxicants before they were made unlawful."
يَـٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ لَيَبْلُوَنَّكُمُ ٱللَّهُ بِشَيْءٍ مِّنَ ٱلصَّيْدِ تَنَالُهُ أَيْدِيكُمْ وَرِمَاحُكُمْ لِيَعْلَمَ ٱللَّهُ مَن يَخَافُهُ بِٱلْغَيْبِ فَمَنِ ٱعْتَدَىٰ بَعْدَ ذٰلِكَ فَلَهُ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,"Then Allah revealed the unlawfulness of game in the year of al-Hudaybiyyah, saying: (O ye who believe) in Muhammad and the Qur'an! (Allah will surely try you somewhat (in the matter) of the game) He will test you regarding the game you pursue on land (which ye take) of their eggs and little ones (with your hands and your spears) to catch wild animals in the year of al-Hudaybiyyah, (that Allah may know) that Allah may see (him who feareth Him in secret) and thus leave the game. (Whoso transgresseth) intentionally (after this) after Allah has decreed the requital and ruling of this, (for him there is a painful doom) a painful beating which will extend to his back and belly."

Kill no wild game while ye are on the pilgrimage) or in the Sacred Precinct. (Whoso of you killeth it of set purpose) this verse was revealed about Abu'l-Yusr Ibn 'Amr who intentionally killed game, forgetting he was in ritual consecration, (he shall pay its forfeit in the equivalent of that which he hath killed, of domestic animals, the judge to be two men among you known for justice) two judges will evaluate such equivalence; ((the forfeit) to be brought as an offering to the Ka'bah; or, for expiation, he shall feed poor persons) or he should give money for it by feeding some of the poor of Mecca, (or the equivalent thereof in fasting) if he cannot feed the poor, he should fast one for each half measure (Sa') of food he is supposed to feed to the poor, (that he may taste the evil consequences) the punishment (of his deed. Allah forgiveth whatever (of this kind) may have happened in the past) before it was made unlawful, (but whoso relapseth) after being condemned and beaten severely in this world, (Allah will take retribution from him) he should be left until Allah takes retribution from him. (Allah is Mighty) in His retribution, (Able to Requite (the wrong)) Able to punish those who do wrong."
أُحِلَّ لَكُمْ صَيْدُ ٱلْبَحْرِ وَطَعَامُهُ مَتَاعاً لَّكُمْ وَلِلسَّيَّارَةِ وَحُرِّمَ عَلَيْكُمْ صَيْدُ ٱلْبَرِّ مَا دُمْتُمْ حُرُماً وَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ ٱلَّذِيۤ إِلَيْهِ تُحْشَرُونَ,"(To hunt and to eat the fish of the sea is made lawful for you) this was revealed about a people from the Banu Mudlij who lived off the sea. They asked the Prophet (pbuh) about the fish of the sea and about that which is washed out of the sea, so Allah revealed that it is lawful to fish just as it is lawful to eat that which is washed out by the sea (a provision for you) a benefit for you (and for seafarers; but to hunt on land is forbidden you so long as ye are on the pilgrimage) or in the Sacred Precinct. (Be mindful of your duty to Allah) fear Allah, (unto Whom ye will be gathered) and questioned about the game made forbidden for you during ritual consecration and at the Sacred Precinct."

(That) which I have mentioned (is so that ye may know that Allah knoweth whatsoever) the benefit of (is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth, and that Allah is Knower of all things) their benefits and also that which is good for the people of the heavens and the earth."

مَّا عَلَى ٱلرَّسُولِ إِلاَّ ٱلْبَلاَغُ وَٱللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ مَا تُبْدُونَ وَمَا تَكْتُمُونَ,(The duty of the messenger is only to convey (the message)) on behalf of Allah. (Allah knoweth what ye proclaim) what you display publicly of good and evil (and what ye hide) of good or evil; it is also said that this means: Allah knows what you display among yourselves and that which you conceal from one another in relation to taking the money of Shurayh.
قُل لاَّ يَسْتَوِي ٱلْخَبِيثُ وَٱلطَّيِّبُ وَلَوْ أَعْجَبَكَ كَثْرَةُ ٱلْخَبِيثِ فَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ يٰأُوْلِي ٱلأَلْبَابِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ,"(Say) O Muhammad, to the people of Sarh who brought Shurayh's property: (The evil) the unlawful: Shurayh's property, (and the good) the lawful property which Shurayh brought (are not alike even though the plenty of the evil) that which is unlawful (attract thee. So be mindful of your duty to Allah) fear Allah regarding taking that which is unlawful, (O men of understanding) O people possessed of mind and reason, (that ye may succeed) that you may be saved from Allah's wrath and torment."
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ لاَ تَسْأَلُواْ عَنْ أَشْيَآءَ إِن تُبْدَ لَكُمْ تَسُؤْكُمْ وَإِن تَسْأَلُواْ عَنْهَا حِينَ يُنَزَّلُ ٱلْقُرْآنُ تُبْدَ لَكُمْ عَفَا ٱللَّهُ عَنْهَا وَٱللَّهُ غَفُورٌ حَلِيمٌ,"(O ye who believe!) this was revealed about Harith Ibn Yazid who asked the Prophet (pbuh)-when the verse (And pilgrimage to the House is a duty unto Allah for mankind) was revealed: “Is it once every year, O Messenger of Allah?” So Allah forbade him from asking such questions, and started by addressing him with (O ye who believe!), (Ask not) your Prophet (of things) that Allah has relieved you of (which, if they were made known unto you) if they were made obligatory upon you, (would trouble you; but if you ask of them) if you ask of the things that you were relieved of (when the Qur'an is being revealed) when Gabriel brings down the Qur'an, (they will be made known unto you) they will be made obligatory upon you. (Allah pardoneth this) this questioning, (for Allah is Forgiving) of the one who repents, (Clement) vis-à-vis your ignorance."
قَدْ سَأَلَهَا قَوْمٌ مِّن قَبْلِكُمْ ثُمَّ أَصْبَحُواْ بِهَا كَافِرِينَ,"(A folk before you asked) their prophets ((for such disclosures) and then disbelieved there in) when things were made clear to them, they disbelieved in them."
مَا جَعَلَ ٱللَّهُ مِن بَحِيرَةٍ وَلاَ سَآئِبَةٍ وَلاَ وَصِيلَةٍ وَلاَ حَامٍ وَلَـٰكِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ يَفْتَرُونَ عَلَىٰ ٱللَّهِ ٱلْكَذِبَ وَأَكْثَرُهُمْ لاَ يَعْقِلُونَ,"(Allah hath not appointed anything in the nature of a Bahirah or a Sa'ibah or a Wasilah or a Hami) He says: Allah has not prohibited the Bahirah, the Sa'ibah, the Wasilah or the Hami. As for the Bahirah, it was the norm that if a she-camel delivered on its fifth birthing a male camel, the latter would be immolated and both men and women would eat from it, but if it were a female, they would cleave its ear. The latter is called a Bahirah. The latter's milk and benefits were for men only, to the exclusion of women, and when she died both men and women could share her meat. As for the Sa'ibah, people used to give whatever they were willing to give of cattle and hand it over to the custodians of idols. The latter would offer it to travellers who passed by, the men not the women. The animals offered were also male and never female. When these died both men and women shared its meat. As for the Wasilah, when a sheep had delivered seven times, they used to check the seventh birth. If it were male, they used to immolate it and its meat was shared by men and women. If it were female, women would not be allowed to benefit from it until the animal died. When the animal died, both men and women shared its meat. If it were a twin delivery, male and female, both were spared for the benefit of men only, until their death. When the animal died, both men and women shared their meat. As for the Ham, it is the male camel whose offspring has produced its own offspring, it is said that such an animal has protected its back. This animal is left alone: it is not used for riding or transporting things. It cannot be stopped from drinking of any water or grazing in any pasture, nor can it be stopped from copulating with any she-camel that comes its way. When this animal gets too old or dies, its meat is shared by men and women. Allah says that He did not prescribe any of these practices described above; (but those who disbelieve) i.e. 'Amr ibn Luhayy and his followers (invent a lie against Allah) by declaring the above unlawful [for some]. (Most of them) all of them (have no sense) in relation to Allah's command, that which He has made lawful and that which He has made unlawful."
وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمْ تَعَالَوْاْ إِلَىٰ مَآ أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ وَإِلَى ٱلرَّسُولِ قَالُواْ حَسْبُنَا مَا وَجَدْنَا عَلَيْهِ آبَاءَنَآ أَوَلَوْ كَانَ آبَاؤُهُمْ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ شَيْئاً وَلاَ يَهْتَدُونَ,"(And when it is said unto them) when the Prophet (pbuh) said to the idolaters of Mecca: (Come unto that which Allah hath revealed) come and make lawful that which Allah has clarified in the Qur'an (and unto the messenger) and come to that which the Messenger has shown you to be lawful, (they say: Enough for us) enough prohibition for us (is that wherein we found our fathers. What! Even though their fathers had no knowledge whatsoever) regarding Allah's divine Oneness and religion, (and no guidance) to the practice of any prophet; it is also said that this means: were not their fathers completely ignorant of the religion and not guided to the practice of the Prophet? How then can their example be followed?"
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ عَلَيْكُمْ أَنْفُسَكُمْ لاَ يَضُرُّكُمْ مَّن ضَلَّ إِذَا ٱهْتَدَيْتُمْ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ مَرْجِعُكُمْ جَمِيعاً فَيُنَبِّئُكُمْ بِمَا كُنْتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ,(O ye who believe! Ye have charge of your own souls) hasten to save your own persons. (He who erreth) the error of the one who errs (cannot injure you if you are rightly guided) to faith and further show their error. (Unto Allah ye will all return) after you die; (and then He will inform you of what ye used to do) and say of good and evil. This verse was revealed about the idolaters of Mecca when the Prophet (pbuh) accepted the capitation tax from the people of the Book and then refused to take it from them. This story has already been mentioned in surah al-Baqarah.
يَا أَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ شَهَادَةُ بَيْنِكُمْ إِذَا حَضَرَ أَحَدَكُمُ ٱلْمَوْتُ حِينَ ٱلْوَصِيَّةِ ٱثْنَانِ ذَوَا عَدْلٍ مِّنْكُمْ أَوْ آخَرَانِ مِنْ غَيْرِكُمْ إِنْ أَنتُمْ ضَرَبْتُمْ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ فَأَصَابَتْكُم مُّصِيبَةُ ٱلْمَوْتِ تَحْبِسُونَهُمَا مِن بَعْدِ ٱلصَّلاَةِ فَيُقْسِمَانِ بِٱللَّهِ إِنِ ٱرْتَبْتُمْ لاَ نَشْتَرِي بِهِ ثَمَناً وَلَوْ كَانَ ذَا قُرْبَىٰ وَلاَ نَكْتُمُ شَهَادَةَ ٱللَّهِ إِنَّآ إِذَاً لَّمِنَ ٱلآَثِمِينَ,"(O ye who believe! Let there be witnesses between you) in settlement or upon travelling (when death draweth nigh unto one of you, at the time of bequest) of the dead person (two witnesses) should testify, just men from among you) two free men; it is also said: two of your own people, (or two others from another tribe) who adhere to your religion, as it is said that this means: two people from outside your own people. Then, leaving the question in the case of settlement, Allah mentioned the same question in the case of travelling, saying: (in case you are campaigning in the land) if you are out in the land or travelling (and the calamity of death befall you). This verse was revealed about three men who travelled together for trade to Historic Syria. On the way, one of them, Budayl Ibn Abi Mariyah, a client of 'Amr Ibn al-'As, who was a Muslim, died. But before he died, he requested his two companions, 'Adiyy Ibn Bida' and Tamim Ibn Aws al-Dari, who were Christians, to hand over his property to his people. They however betrayed his testament. So Allah said to the custodians of the deceased person: (You shall empanel them both) the two Christians (after the prayer) of 'Asr, (and, if ye doubt) O custodian of the deceased person that they gave back less than the deceased person had with him, (they shall be made to swear by Allah (saying): We will not take a bribe) let them say: we will not exchange our oath for a paltry portion of this world, (even though it were (on behalf of) a near kinsman) even if the deceased person is one of our kinsmen (nor will we hide the testimony of Allah) let them also say: we will not withhold our testimony, if asked, (for then) for if we withhold our testimony (indeed we should be of the sinful) i.e. of the wrong-doers."
فَإِنْ عُثِرَ عَلَىٰ أَنَّهُمَا ٱسْتَحَقَّآ إِثْماً فَآخَرَانِ يَقُومَانِ مَقَامَهُمَا مِنَ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱسْتَحَقَّ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلأَوْلَيَانِ فَيُقْسِمَانِ بِٱللَّهِ لَشَهَادَتُنَا أَحَقُّ مِن شَهَادَتِهِمَا وَمَا ٱعْتَدَيْنَآ إِنَّا إِذاً لَّمِنَ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ,"However, it became clear after their testimony that they had betrayed the dead person, and the custodians of the deceased found out. Allah said: (But then, if it is afterwards ascertained that both of them merit (the suspicion of) sin) of betrayal, (let two others) representing the deceased person, 'Amr Ibn al-'As and Muttalib Ibn Abi Wada'ah (take their place) the place of the two Christians (of those nearly concerned) about such a betrayal, i.e. the two Christians, and it is said that the reference here is to those from whom the property was taken away, i.e. the custodians of the deceased person, (and let them) the custodians of the deceased person (swear by Allah) that the property that was with the deceased person was more than what the two Christians gave back, ((saying): Verily our testimony) the testimony of the Muslims (is truer than their testimony) the testimony of the Christians (and we have not transgressed) let them say: we have not transgressed in our claim, (for then) for if we have transgressed (indeed we should be of the evil-doers) liars who harm others."
ذٰلِكَ أَدْنَىٰ أَن يَأْتُواْ بِٱلشَّهَادَةِ عَلَىٰ وَجْهِهَآ أَوْ يَخَافُوۤاْ أَن تُرَدَّ أَيْمَانٌ بَعْدَ أَيْمَانِهِمْ وَٱتَّقُوا ٱللَّهَ وَٱسْمَعُواْ وَٱللَّهُ لاَ يَهْدِي ٱلْقَوْمَ ٱلْفَاسِقِينَ,"(Thus it is more likely) it is more appropriate and worthier (that they) the Christians (will hear true witness or fear) i.e. the Christians (that after their oath the oath (of others) will be taken) i.e. the oath of the Muslims will be taken, so let them not withhold their testimony. (So be mindful of your duty (to Allah)) fear Allah regarding that which is entrusted to you (and hearken) to that with which you are commanded and obey Allah. (Allah guideth not the froward folk) He does not guide to His religion or clear proof lying, transgressing disbelievers nor does He guide those who are not fit for His guidance."
يَوْمَ يَجْمَعُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلرُّسُلَ فَيَقُولُ مَاذَآ أُجِبْتُمْ قَالُواْ لاَ عِلْمَ لَنَآ إِنَّكَ أَنتَ عَلاَّمُ ٱلْغُيُوبِ,"(In the day when Allah gathereth together the messengers) this is on the Day of Judgement, (and saith) in some place, at the time of bedazzlement: (What was your response (from mankind)) how did people respond to you? (They say) due to the intensity of the situation, which is that place: (We have no knowledge. Lo! Thou, only Thou art the Knower of Things Hidden) i.e. that which is hidden from us of the response of people. But later, they answer and testify that they have delivered the message to their people."

Remember My favour) recollect My grace (unto thee) by bestowing prophethood upon you (and unto thy mother) by gracing her with complete surrender to Allah and with worship; (how I strengthened thee with the holy Spirit) the pure Gabriel: he taught and helped you talk to people, (so that thou spakest unto mankind in the cradle) in your mother's lap and in your cot, saying: I am Allah's servant and anointed one (as in maturity) as did Gabriel help you after you reached your thirtieth year when you said to them: I am Allah's Messenger to you; (and how I taught you the Scripture) the Scriptures of past prophets; and it is said that this means: writing with the pen (and Wisdom) the wisdom of past sages; it is also said that this means: the lawful and the unlawful (and the Torah) and taught you the Torah in the womb of your mother (and the Gospel) after you were born; (and how thou didst shape of clay as it were the likeness of a bird) a bat (by My permission) by My command, (and didst blow upon it) like the breathing of a sleeping person (and it was a bird) flying in the air (by My permission) by My command and will, (and thou didst heal him who was born blind and the leper by My permission) by My command, will and power; (and how thou didst raise the dead) by means of My will and through Me give life to the dead, (by My permission and how I restrained the Children of Israel from you) when they decided to kill you (when thou camest unto them with clear proofs) with commands, prohibitions and the wondrous things that you showed them, (and those of them who disbelieved) from among the Children of Israel (exclaimed: This) which Jesus is showing us (is naught else than mere magic);"
وَإِذْ أَوْحَيْتُ إِلَى ٱلْحَوَارِيِّينَ أَنْ آمِنُواْ بِي وَبِرَسُولِي قَالُوۤاْ آمَنَّا وَٱشْهَدْ بِأَنَّنَا مُسْلِمُونَ,"(And when I inspired the disciples) who were 12 in number, ((saying): Believe in Me and in My messenger) Jesus, (they said: We believe) in You and in Your Messenger Jesus. (Bear witness) you, O Jesus, and they also bore witness one for the other (that we have surrendered (unto You)) sincere in worship and in declaring Allah's divine Oneness."
إِذْ قَالَ ٱلْحَوَارِيُّونَ يٰعِيسَى ٱبْنَ مَرْيَمَ هَلْ يَسْتَطِيعُ رَبُّكَ أَن يُنَزِّلَ عَلَيْنَا مَآئِدَةً مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ قَالَ ٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ إِن كُنْتُم مُّؤْمِنِينَ,"(When the disciples) the chosen among them, Simon the Pure (said: O Jesus, son of Mary!) your people are asking: (Is thy Lord able) would your Lord; and it is also said that this means: could you pray to your Lord (to send down for us a table spread with food from heaven? He said:) Jesus said to Simon: tell them (Observe your duty to Allah) fear Allah, (if ye are true believers) if you have firm faith, for it may happen that you would not give gratitude for it and, as a result, be punished. And so Simon conveyed the message to them."
قَالُواْ نُرِيدُ أَن نَّأْكُلَ مِنْهَا وَتَطْمَئِنَّ قُلُوبُنَا وَنَعْلَمَ أَن قَدْ صَدَقْتَنَا وَنَكُونَ عَلَيْهَا مِنَ ٱلشَّاهِدِينَ,"(They said: We wish to eat thereof, that we may satisfy our hearts) regarding the marvels that you show us (and know) and have certainty (that thou hast spoken truth to us) regarding all what you said, (and that thereof we may be witnesses) when we go back to our people."

Send down for us a table spread with food from heaven) it is also said that this means: send down for us the grace of food, for they already had some food with them, (that it may be a feast for Us, for the first of us) the people of our own time (and for the last of us) those who come after us, so that we worship you on this day, which happened to be a Sunday, (and a sign from You) for he who believes and an argument against he who disbelieves. (Give us sustenance) give us that which we have asked for, (for Thou art the Best of Sustainers) the Best of those who feed others."
قَالَ ٱللَّهُ إِنِّي مُنَزِّلُهَا عَلَيْكُمْ فَمَن يَكْفُرْ بَعْدُ مِنكُمْ فَإِنِّيۤ أُعَذِّبُهُ عَذَاباً لاَّ أُعَذِّبُهُ أَحَداً مِّنَ ٱلْعَالَمِينَ,"(Allah said) to Jesus, tell them: (Lo! I send it down for you) that which you have asked for. (And whoso disbelieveth of you afterward) after sending it down and eating from it, (him surely will I punish with a punishment wherewith I have not punished any of (My) creatures) of his time: I will turn them into swine. But after they ate from the food, they said: this is clear magic. Jesus said in response: O Allah! If you punish them for what they are saying, they are Your servants; but if you forgive them, You are Mighty in Your retribution towards him who does not repent."

ٱلَّذِينَ آتَيْنَاهُمُ ٱلْكِتَابَ يَعْرِفُونَهُ كَمَا يَعْرِفُونَ أَبْنَآءَهُمُ ٱلَّذِينَ خَسِرُوۤاْ أَنْفُسَهُمْ فَهُمْ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ,"(Those unto whom We gave the Scripture) those unto who We gave the knowledge of the Torah, i.e. 'Abdullah Ibn Salam and his followers (recognise (him)) Muhammad through his traits and description (as they recognise their sons. Those who ruin their own souls) through losing this world and the Next, i.e. Ka'b Ibn al-Ashraf and his followers (will not believe) in Muhammad or the Qur'an."
وَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّنِ ٱفْتَرَىٰ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ كَذِباً أَوْ كَذَّبَ بِآيَٰتِهِ إِنَّهُ لاَ يُفْلِحُ ٱلظَّٰلِمُونَ,(Who doth greater wrong) and is more daring (than he who inventeth a lie against Allah) by associating with Him other gods (and denieth His revelations) Muhammad and the Qur'an? (Lo! the wrong-doers) the disbelievers and idolaters (will not be successful) will not escape or be safe from Allah's torment.
وَيَوْمَ نَحْشُرُهُمْ جَمِيعاً ثُمَّ نَقُولُ لِلَّذِينَ أَشْرَكُواْ أَيْنَ شُرَكَآؤُكُمُ ٱلَّذِينَ كُنتُمْ تَزْعُمُونَ,(And on the Day We gather them together) all mankind on the Day of Judgement (We shall say unto those who ascribed partners (unto Allah): Where are (now) those partners) idols (of your make-believe) that you worshipped and claimed they would intercede for you?

وَمِنْهُمْ مَّن يَسْتَمِعُ إِلَيْكَ وَجَعَلْنَا عَلَىٰ قُلُوبِهِمْ أَكِنَّةً أَن يَفْقَهُوهُ وَفِيۤ ءَاذَانِهِمْ وَقْراً وَإِن يَرَوْاْ كُلَّ ءَايَةٍ لاَّ يُؤْمِنُواْ بِهَا حَتَّىٰ إِذَا جَآءُوكَ يُجَٰدِلُونَكَ يَقُولُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوۤاْ إِنْ هَـٰذَآ إِلاَّ أَسَٰطِيرُ ٱلأَوَّلِينَ,"(Of them are some who listen unto you) Allah says: of the people of Mecca there are some who listen to your speech and words, among them Abu Sufyan Ibn Harb, al-Walid Ibn al-Mughira, al-Nadr Ibn al-Harith, 'Utbah and Shaybah the sons of Rabi'ah, Umayyah Ibn Khalaf, and al-Harth Ibn 'Amir, (but We have placed upon their hearts veils) a cover, (lest they should understand) so that they do not understand your speech or words, (and in their ears a deafness) so that they do not hear the Truth and guidance; it is also said this means: We have placed a heaviness in their ears so that they cannot comprehend the guidance. (If they saw every token) they have asked you to produce (they would not believe therein) this was asked by al-Harth Ibn 'Amir; (to the point that, when they come unto thee to argue with thee) asking you about what was revealed in the Qur'an, and when you informed them, (the disbelievers) i.e. al-Nadr Ibn al-Harith (say: This) what Muhammad (s)ays (is naught else than fables of the men of old) the lies and stories of people of old."
وَهُمْ يَنْهَوْنَ عَنْهُ وَيَنْأَوْنَ عَنْهُ وَإِن يُهْلِكُونَ إِلاَّ أَنفُسَهُمْ وَمَا يَشْعُرُونَ,"(And they) Abu Jahl and his folk (forbid (men) from it) from Muhammad and the Qur'an (and avoid it) prevent people from it and steer away from it; it is also said that this relates to Abu Talib [the Prophet's uncle] who used to warn against harming the Prophet (pbuh) even though he did not accept his message, (and they ruin none save themselves, though they perceive not) they do not realise that they carry the same sins of the men they are warning."
وَلَوْ تَرَىٰ إِذْ وُقِفُواْ عَلَى ٱلنَّارِ فَقَالُواْ يٰلَيْتَنَا نُرَدُّ وَلاَ نُكَذِّبَ بِآيَٰتِ رَبِّنَا وَنَكُونَ مِنَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,"(If thou couldst see) O Muhammad (when they are set before) locked up in (the Fire and say: Oh, would that we might return!) to the world (Then would we not deny the revelations of our Lord) i.e. in the Scriptures and messengers (but we would be of the believers!) with the believers inwardly and outwardly."
بَلْ بَدَا لَهُمْ مَّا كَانُواْ يُخْفُونَ مِن قَبْلُ وَلَوْ رُدُّواْ لَعَادُواْ لِمَا نُهُواْ عَنْهُ وَإِنَّهُمْ لَكَاذِبُونَ,"(Nay, but that) their punishment (hath become clear unto them which before) in the life of this world (they used to hide) their disbelief and idolatry. (And if they were sent back) to the life of this world, as they request (they would return unto that which they are forbidden) their disbelief and idolatry. (Lo! they are liars) because were they to be returned, they would still not believe."

He will say) Allah says to them; it is also said that this means: the angels say to them: (Is not this real?) Is not this torment and resurrection after death real? (They will say: Yea, verily, by our Lord!) It is the Truth as informed by the messengers (He will say: Taste now the retribution for that ye used to disbelieve) in your resurrection after death."
قَدْ خَسِرَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَذَّبُواْ بِلِقَآءِ ٱللَّهِ حَتَّىٰ إِذَا جَآءَتْهُمُ ٱلسَّاعَةُ بَغْتَةً قَالُواْ يٰحَسْرَتَنَا عَلَىٰ مَا فَرَّطْنَا فِيهَا وَهُمْ يَحْمِلُونَ أَوْزَارَهُمْ عَلَىٰ ظُهُورِهِمْ أَلاَ سَآءَ مَا يَزِرُونَ,"(They indeed are losers who deny their meeting with Allah) i.e. deny their resurrection after death; Allah says: leave them (until, when the Hour cometh on them suddenly, they cry: Alas for us) how great is our sadness, and how sorry we are, (that we neglected it!) that we neglected faith and repentance in our worldly life. (They bear upon their back their burdens) their sins. (Ah, evil is that which they bear) of sins!"
وَمَا ٱلْحَيَٰوةُ ٱلدُّنْيَآ إِلاَّ لَعِبٌ وَلَهْوٌ وَلَلدَّارُ ٱلآخِرَةُ خَيْرٌ لِّلَّذِينَ يَتَّقُونَ أَفَلاَ تَعْقِلُونَ,"(Naught is the life of the world) the comfort and enjoyment of the life of the world is nothing (save a pastime) amusement (and a sport) worthless activity.

Do you not comprehend that this world is evanescent and that the Hereafter is everlasting?"
قَدْ نَعْلَمُ إِنَّهُ لَيَحْزُنُكَ ٱلَّذِي يَقُولُونَ فَإِنَّهُمْ لاَ يُكَذِّبُونَكَ وَلَـٰكِنَّ ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ بِآيَاتِ ٱللَّهِ يَجْحَدُونَ,"(We know well how their talk) their slander, denial and demand for proofs (grieveth thee) O Muhammad, (though in truth they) i.e. al-Harth Ibn 'Amir and his followers (deny not thee (Muhammad)) inwardly (but evil-doers) the idolaters (flout the revelations of Allah) quite openly."
وَلَقَدْ كُذِّبَتْ رُسُلٌ مِّن قَبْلِكَ فَصَبَرُواْ عَلَىٰ مَا كُذِّبُواْ وَأُوذُواْ حَتَّىٰ أَتَاهُمْ نَصْرُنَا وَلاَ مُبَدِّلَ لِكَلِمَاتِ ٱللَّهِ وَلَقدْ جَآءَكَ مِن نَّبَإِ ٱلْمُرْسَلِينَ,"(Messengers indeed have been denied before thee) their people denied them as your people deny you now, (and they were patient under the denial) of their own people (and the persecution) and they were patient in the face of their people's harm (till Our succour reached them) through the destruction of their people. (There is none to alter the decisions of Allah) in that He helps His friends against His enemies. (Already there hath reached thee) O Muhammad ((somewhat) of the tidings of the messengers (We sent before)) how their people denied them, as your people deny you now, and how they were patient."

(If Allah willed, He could have brought them all together to the guidance) to the declaration of Allah's divine Oneness. (So be not thou among the foolish ones) regarding My decree about their disbelief."
إِنَّمَا يَسْتَجِيبُ ٱلَّذِينَ يَسْمَعُونَ وَٱلْمَوْتَىٰ يَبْعَثُهُمُ ٱللَّهُ ثُمَّ إِلَيْهِ يُرْجَعُونَ,"(Only those can accept) believe and obey (who hear) who give their assent; it is also said: those who comprehend admonition. (As for the dead) the dead of the Battle Badr, Uhud, and the Battle of the Confederates; it is also said that this means: the dead of heart, (Allah will raise them up) after death; (then unto Him they will be returned) in the place of mustering and He will reward them for their works."
وَقَالُواْ لَوْلاَ نُزِّلَ عَلَيْهِ آيَةٌ مِّن رَّبِّهِ قُلْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ قَادِرٌ عَلَىٰ أَن يُنَزِّلٍ آيَةً وَلَـٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَهُمْ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ,"(They say) i.e. the disbelievers of Mecca: al-Harth Ibn 'Amir and his folk: Abu Jahl Ibn Hisham, al-Walid Ibn al-Mughira, Umayyah and Ubayy the sons of Khalaf: (Why hath no portent been sent down upon him from his Lord) to prove his prophethood? (Say) to them, O Muhammad: (Lo! Allah is Able to send down a portent) as they have asked. (But most of them know not) they have no knowledge of it being sent."
وَمَا مِن دَآبَّةٍ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَلاَ طَائِرٍ يَطِيرُ بِجَنَاحَيْهِ إِلاَّ أُمَمٌ أَمْثَالُكُمْ مَّا فَرَّطْنَا فِي ٱلكِتَٰبِ مِن شَيْءٍ ثُمَّ إِلَىٰ رَبِّهِمْ يُحْشَرُونَ,"(There is not an animal in the earth, nor a flying creature flying on two wings) between the earth and sky, (but they are peoples) creations and servants (like unto you) they resemble you in eating, copulation, understanding one another, just as you understand one another: this is a sign for you. (We have neglected nothing in the Book) We have neglected nothing that We have inscribed in the Preserved Tablet; We have mentioned everything in the Qur'an. (Then unto their Lord they) the birds and beasts (will be gathered) with all other created beings on the Day of Judgement."

(Whom Allah will He sendeth astray) He makes him die in a state of disbelief, (and whom He will) He makes him die such that (He placeth on a straight path) places on the straight path which He is pleased with; it is also said that this means: Allah forsakes whom He will and guides, gives success and firmness in adhering to the straight path (Islam), which He is pleased with, to whom He will."
قُلْ أَرَءَيْتَكُمْ إِنْ أَتَـٰكُمْ عَذَابُ ٱللَّهِ أَوْ أَتَتْكُمُ ٱلسَّاعَةُ أَغَيْرَ ٱللَّهِ تَدْعُونَ إِن كُنتُمْ صَـٰدِقِينَ,"(Say: Can ye see yourselves) what you are saying, O people of Mecca, (if the punishment of Allah come upon you) such was the case on the Day of Badr, Uhud or the Confederates (or the Hour come upon you) or if torment comes upon you on the Day of Judgement, (calling upon other than Allah? Do ye then call (for help) to any other than Allah) to lift the torment from you? ((Answer that) if ye are truthful) that the idols are His partners."
بَلْ إِيَّاهُ تَدْعُونَ فَيَكْشِفُ مَا تَدْعُونَ إِلَيْهِ إِنْ شَآءَ وَتَنسَوْنَ مَا تُشْرِكُونَ,"(Nay, but unto Him ye call) meaning that they will not call anyone except Allah to lift the torment from them, (and He removeth that because of which you call unto Him, if He will, and you forget) you leave (whatever partners ye ascribed unto Him) you leave the idols and do not call unto them."
وَلَقَدْ أَرْسَلنَآ إِلَىٰ أُمَمٍ مِّن قَبْلِكَ فَأَخَذْنَٰهُمْ بِٱلْبَأْسَآءِ وَٱلضَّرَّآءِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَضَرَّعُونَ,"(We have sent already unto peoples that were before you) just as We have sent you to your people, (and We visited them with tribulation) fear from one another, affliction and hardship, when they did not believe (and adversity) illness, pain and hunger, (in order that they might grow humble) in order that they may believe and pray that I lift the punishment from them."
فَلَوْلاۤ إِذْ جَآءَهُمْ بَأْسُنَا تَضَرَّعُواْ وَلَـٰكِن قَسَتْ قُلُوبُهُمْ وَزَيَّنَ لَهُمُ ٱلشَّيْطَانُ مَا كَانُواّ يَعْمَلُونَ,"(If only, when our disaster) punishment (came on them, they had been humble) they had believed! (But their hearts were hardened) their hearts dried up (and the devil made all that they used to do) in their disbelief that such is the state of life: hardship alternates with ease and comfort (seem fair unto them!)"
فَلَمَّا نَسُواْ مَا ذُكِّرُواْ بِهِ فَتَحْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ أَبْوَابَ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ حَتَّىٰ إِذَا فَرِحُواْ بِمَآ أُوتُوۤاْ أَخَذْنَاهُمْ بَغْتَةً فَإِذَا هُمْ مُّبْلِسُونَ,"(Then, when they forgot that whereof they had been reminded) when they turned their backs on that which they had been commanded with in the Scripture, (We opened unto them the gates of all things) vegetation, land fertility and comfort (till, even as they were rejoicing in that which they were given) vegetation, land fertility and comfort, (We seized them unawares) with punishment, (and lo! they were dumbfounded) despairing of any good."
فَقُطِعَ دَابِرُ ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ وَٱلْحَمْدُ للَّهِ رَبِّ ٱلْعَالَمِينَ,"(So of the people who did wrong) who ascribed partners to Allah, they were exterminated through punishment (the last remnant was cut off. Praise be to Allah) say praise and thanks be to Allah, (Lord of the Worlds!) for their extermination."
قُلْ أَرَأَيْتُمْ إِنْ أَخَذَ ٱللَّهُ سَمْعَكُمْ وَأَبْصَارَكُمْ وَخَتَمَ عَلَىٰ قُلُوبِكُمْ مَّنْ إِلَـٰهٌ غَيْرُ ٱللَّهِ يَأْتِيكُمْ بِهِ ٱنْظُرْ كَيْفَ نُصَرِّفُ ٱلآيَاتِ ثُمَّ هُمْ يَصْدِفُونَ,"(Say: Have ye imagined) what you are saying, O people of Mecca, (if Allah should take away your hearing) such that you do not hear any admonition or guidance (and your sight) such that you do not see the Truth (and seal your hearts) such that you do not perceive the Truth or guidance, (who is the God) referring here to the idols (who could restore it to you) that which Allah has taken away from you (save Allah? See) O Muhammad (how We display the revelations unto them) how We explain the Qur'an to them? (Yet still they turn away) they deny the revelations."
قُلْ أَرَءَيْتَكُمْ إِنْ أَتَـٰكُمْ عَذَابُ ٱللَّهِ بَغْتَةً أَوْ جَهْرَةً هَلْ يُهْلَكُ إِلاَّ ٱلْقَوْمُ ٱلظَّٰلِمُونَ,"(Say: Can ye see yourselves) O people of Mecca, (if the punishment of Allah come upon you unawares) suddenly (or openly? Would any perish) through such a punishment (save wrong-doing folk?) who disobey that with which they have been commanded; it is also said that this refers to the idolaters."
وَمَا نُرْسِلُ ٱلْمُرْسَلِينَ إِلاَّ مُبَشِّرِينَ وَمُنذِرِينَ فَمَنْ ءَامَنَ وَأَصْلَحَ فَلاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلاَ هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ,"(We send not the messengers save as bearers of good news) of Paradise for whoever believes (and warners) of the Fire for whoever disbelieves. (Whoso believeth) in the messengers and Scriptures (and doeth right) regarding that which is between him and his Lord, (there shall no fear come upon them) when fear comes upon the folk of hell (neither shall they grieve) when the people of hell grieve."
وَٱلَّذِينَ كَذَّبُواْ بِآيَاتِنَا يَمَسُّهُمُ ٱلْعَذَابُ بِمَا كَانُواْ يَفْسُقُونَ,"(But as for those who deny Our revelations) those who deny Muhammad and the Qur'an, (torment will afflict them for that they used to disobey) because of their denial of Muhammad and the Qur'an."

I am an angel) from heaven. (I follow) I do and say (only that which is inspired in me) only that which I am commanded with in the Qur'an. (Say) O Muhammad: (Are the blind man and the seer equal?) Are the believer and disbeliever equal in acts of obedience and reward? (Will ye not then take thought) about the similes of the Qur'an? This verse was revealed about Abu Jahl and his companions al-Nadr Ibn al-Harith and 'Uyaynah, and then it was revealed about the clients."
وَأَنذِرْ بِهِ ٱلَّذِينَ يَخَافُونَ أَن يُحْشَرُوۤاْ إِلَىٰ رَبِّهِمْ لَيْسَ لَهُمْ مِّن دُونِهِ وَلِيٌّ وَلاَ شَفِيعٌ لَّعَلَّهُمْ يَتَّقُونَ,"(Warn hereby) warn by the Qur'an; it is also said that this means: warn by Allah (those who fear) those who know and have certainty, among them Bilal Ibn Rabah, Suhayb Ibn Sinan, Mihja' Ibn Salih, 'Ammar Ibn Yasir, Salman al-Farisi, 'Amir Ibn Fuhayrah, Khabbab Ibn al-Aratt and Salim, the client of Abu Hudhayfah, (that they will be gathered unto their Lord) after death, (for whom there is no protecting friend) to protect them (nor intercessor beside Him) to interceded for them or save them from the torment, (that they may ward off (evil)) ward off transgressions, and this will help them perform works of obedience."
وَلاَ تَطْرُدِ ٱلَّذِينَ يَدْعُونَ رَبَّهُمْ بِٱلْغَدَاةِ وَٱلْعَشِيِّ يُرِيدُونَ وَجْهَهُ مَا عَلَيْكَ مِنْ حِسَابِهِم مِّن شَيْءٍ وَمَا مِنْ حِسَابِكَ عَلَيْهِمْ مِّن شَيْءٍ فَتَطْرُدَهُمْ فَتَكُونَ مِنَ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ,"(Repel not) O Muhammad, because of what 'Uyaynah Ibn Hisn al-Fazari has said-he said: “repel these from you so that the nobles of Mecca come to you, hear you and believe in you”-and these nobles also asked 'Umar to request the Prophet (pbuh) to allocate one day for them and another for weak believers, but Allah rejected this and warned them against such a deed, (those who call upon their Lord) Salman and his fellow believers, among the clients, who worship their Lord (at morn and evening) through performing the five daily prayers, (seeking His Countenance) and by doing so they only seek Allah's Countenance and good pleasure. (Thou art not accountable for them) for their provision (in aught, nor are they accountable for you) for your provision (in aught, that thou shouldst repel them and be of the wrong-doers) of those who harm themselves."
وَكَذٰلِكَ فَتَنَّا بَعْضَهُمْ بِبَعْضٍ لِّيَقُولوۤاْ أَهَـٰؤُلاۤءِ مَنَّ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْهِم مِّن بَيْنِنَآ أَلَيْسَ ٱللَّهُ بِأَعْلَمَ بِٱلشَّٰكِرِينَ,"(And even so) thus (do We try) test (some of them by others) the Arab by the client and the noble by the lowly person. This was revealed about 'Uyaynah Ibn Hisn al-Fazari, 'Utbah and Shaybah the sons of Rabi'ah, Umayyah Ibn Khalaf al-Jumahi, al-Walid Ibn al-Mughirah al-Makhzumi, Abu Jahl Ibn Hisham, Suhayl Ibn 'Amr and their likes among the leaders of the Quraysh who were tested by the clients, (that they) i.e. 'Uyaynah Ibn Hisn al-Fazari and his lot (say: Are these) i.e. Salman and his fellow believers (they whom Allah favoureth) with faith (among us? Is not Allah best aware of the thanksgivers) of the believers, those who deserve such favour?"
وَإِذَا جَآءَكَ ٱلَّذِينَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِآيَاتِنَا فَقُلْ سَلَٰمٌ عَلَيْكُمْ كَتَبَ رَبُّكُمْ عَلَىٰ نَفْسِهِ ٱلرَّحْمَةَ أَنَّهُ مَن عَمِلَ مِنكُمْ سُوۤءًا بِجَهَٰلَةٍ ثُمَّ تَابَ مِن بَعْدِهِ وَأَصْلَحَ فَأَنَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"(And when those who believe in Our revelations) in our Book and Messenger; the reference here is to 'Umar Ibn al-Khattab (come unto thee, say) O Muhammad: (Peace be unto you!) Allah has accepted your repentance and excuse (Your Lord hath prescribed for Himself mercy) for anyone who repents, (that whoso of you doeth evil) sins (through ignorance) intentionally even though he did not know its due punishment (and repenteth afterward thereof) and repents of this sin (and doeth right) in relation to that which is between him and his Lord, ((for him) lo! Allah is Forgiving) He overlooks sins, (Merciful) towards him who repents."
وَكَذَلِكَ نفَصِّلُ ٱلآيَاتِ وَلِتَسْتَبِينَ سَبِيلُ ٱلْمُجْرِمِينَ,"(Thus do We expound the revelations) We expound the Qur'an, explaining commands, prohibitions as well as their events (that the way of the unrighteous may be manifest) the way of the idolaters, 'Uyaynah and his folk, why it is that they do not believe?"
قُلْ إِنِّي نُهِيتُ أَنْ أَعْبُدَ ٱلَّذِينَ تَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ قُلْ لاَّ أَتَّبِعُ أَهْوَآءَكُمْ قَدْ ضَلَلْتُ إِذاً وَمَآ أَنَاْ مِنَ ٱلْمُهْتَدِينَ,"(Say) O Muhammad to 'Uyaynah and his folk: (I am forbidden) in the Qur'an (to worship those on whom you call) you worship (instead of Allah) i.e. idols. (Say) O Muhammad to 'Uyaynah and his folk: (I will not follow your desires) by worshipping idols and repelling Salman and his fellow believers from me, (for then) for if I do that (should I go astray) from guidance (and I should not be of the rightly guided) to that which is right if I were to do so."
قُلْ إِنِّي عَلَىٰ بَيِّنَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّي وَكَذَّبْتُم بِهِ مَا عِندِي مَا تَسْتَعْجِلُونَ بِهِ إِنِ ٱلْحُكْمُ إِلاَّ للَّهِ يَقُصُّ ٱلْحَقَّ وَهُوَ خَيْرُ ٱلْفَٰصِلِينَ,"(Say) O Muhammad to al-Nadr Ibn al-Harith and his folk: (I am (relying) on clear proof from my Lord) and I have full insight of my matter and religion, (while you deny Him) you deny the Qur'an and Allah's divine Oneness. (I have not that for which ye are impatient) i.e. your punishment. (The decision) to send a punishment on you (is for Allah only. He telleth the Truth) His judgement is just and He commands only that which is right (and He is the Best of Deciders) the best of Judges."
قُل لَّوْ أَنَّ عِندِي مَا تَسْتَعْجِلُونَ بِهِ لَقُضِيَ ٱلأَمْرُ بَيْنِي وَبَيْنَكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ أَعْلَمُ بِٱلظَّالِمِينَ,"(Say) O Muhammad: (If I had that for which ye are impatient) i.e. punishment, (then would the case (ere this) have been decided between me and you) you would have already been destroyed. (Allah is best aware of the wrong-doers) of the punishment of the idolaters: al-Nadr Ibn al-Harith and his folk. Then, the punishment for which al-Nadr Ibn al-Harith asked happened: he was killed in captivity on the Day of Badr."
وَعِندَهُ مَفَاتِحُ ٱلْغَيْبِ لاَ يَعْلَمُهَآ إِلاَّ هُوَ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا فِي ٱلْبَرِّ وَٱلْبَحْرِ وَمَا تَسْقُطُ مِن وَرَقَةٍ إِلاَّ يَعْلَمُهَا وَلاَ حَبَّةٍ فِي ظُلُمَٰتِ ٱلأَرْضِ وَلاَ رَطْبٍ وَلاَ يَابِسٍ إِلاَّ فِي كِتَٰبٍ مُّبِينٍ,"(And with Him are the keys of the invisible) the stores of the unseen: rain, vegetation, fruits, and the descent of punishment you asked for on the Day of Badr. (None but He knoweth them) no one knows the keys of the unseen: when the punishment for which you are impatient will come down on you. (And He knoweth what is in the land and the sea) of created beings and marvels; it is also said that this means: Allah knows what He destroys in the land and in the sea. (Not a leaf falleth) from a tree (but He knoweth it) He knows how many times it spins in the air before it falls, (not a grain amid the darkness of the earth) under a rock at the bottom of the earth except that He knows it, (naught of wet) i.e. water (or dry) steppe (but (it is noted) in a) written (clear record) all of it is in the Guarded Tablet: with their precise measure and time."
وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِي يَتَوَفَّٰكُم بِٱلَّيلِ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا جَرَحْتُم بِٱلنَّهَارِ ثُمَّ يَبْعَثُكُمْ فِيهِ لِيُقْضَىٰ أَجَلٌ مُّسَمًّى ثُمَّ إِلَيْهِ مَرْجِعُكُمْ ثُمَّ يُنَبِّئُكُم بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ,"(He it is Who gathereth you at night) He takes your souls away in your sleep (and knoweth that which ye commit) you earn (by day. Then He raiseth you again to life) He returns to you again your souls (therein) in the day, (that the term appointed (for you) may be accomplished) that your lifespan and provisions reach their terms. (And afterward unto Him is your return) after you die. (Then He will proclaim unto you what ye used to do) of good and evil."
وَهُوَ ٱلْقَاهِرُ فَوْقَ عِبَادِهِ وَيُرْسِلُ عَلَيْكُم حَفَظَةً حَتَّىٰ إِذَا جَآءَ أَحَدَكُمُ ٱلْمَوْتُ تَوَفَّتْهُ رُسُلُنَا وَهُمْ لاَ يُفَرِّطُونَ,"(He is the Omnipotent) the All-Conquering (over His slaves. He sendeth guardians) angels: two angels during the day and two at night; they record your good and bad deeds (over you until, when death cometh unto one of you, Our messengers) i.e. the angel of death and his assistants (receive him, and they neglect not) they do not delay the time of death by even a fraction of a second."
ثُمَّ رُدُّوۤاْ إِلَىٰ ٱللَّهِ مَوْلاَهُمُ ٱلْحَقِّ أَلاَ لَهُ ٱلْحُكْمُ وَهُوَ أَسْرَعُ ٱلْحَاسِبِينَ,"(Then are they restored unto Allah) on the Day of Judgement, (their Lord, the Just) Who is in charge of their right and just reward and punishment; it is also said (their Lord, the Just) means: their true God whom they ought to have worshipped, but they did not worship Him truly as He ought to have been worshipped. However, objects of worship other than Allah are void. (Surely His is the judgement) between people on the Day of Judgement. (And He is the most swift of reckoners) when He takes people to task, He does so swiftly."
قُلْ مَن يُنَجِّيكُمْ مِّن ظُلُمَاتِ ٱلْبَرِّ وَٱلْبَحْرِ تَدْعُونَهُ تَضَرُّعاً وَخُفْيَةً لَّئِنْ أَنجَانَا مِنْ هَـٰذِهِ لَنَكُونَنَّ مِنَ ٱلشَّاكِرِينَ,"(Say) O Muhammad to the disbelievers of Mecca: (Who delivereth you from the darkness) from the hardships and tumults (of the land and the sea? Ye call upon Him humbly and in secret) openly and in secret, ((saying): If we are delivered from this) from these hardships and tumults (we truly will be of the thankful) of the believers."
قُلِ ٱللَّهُ يُنَجِّيكُمْ مِّنْهَا وَمِن كُلِّ كَرْبٍ ثُمَّ أَنتُمْ تُشْرِكُونَ,"(Say) to them, O Muhammad: (Allah delivereth you from this) from the hardships of the sea and the land (and from all afflictions) from all grief and turmoil. (Yet ye) people of Mecca (attribute partners) idols (unto Him)."
قُلْ هُوَ ٱلْقَادِرُ عَلَىٰ أَن يَبْعَثَ عَلَيْكُمْ عَذَاباً مِّن فَوْقِكُمْ أَوْ مِن تَحْتِ أَرْجُلِكُمْ أَوْ يَلْبِسَكُمْ شِيَعاً وَيُذِيقَ بَعْضَكُمْ بَأْسَ بَعْضٍ ٱنْظُرْ كَيْفَ نُصَرِّفُ ٱلآيَاتِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَفْقَهُونَ,"(Say) to them, O Muhammad: (He is able to send punishment upon you from above you) as He did on the people of Noah and the people of Lot (or from beneath your feet) or make the earth swallow you as it swallowed Korah, (or to bewilder you with dissension) make divide into conflicting sects as He did with the Children of Israel after the prophets (and make you taste the tyranny) the sword of (one of another. See) O Muhammad (how We display the revelations) how We expound in the Qur'an the events of past nations and that which We did with them (so that they may understand) so that they may understand Allah's commands and His divine Oneness."
وَكَذَّبَ بِهِ قَوْمُكَ وَهُوَ ٱلْحَقُّ قُل لَّسْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ بِوَكِيلٍ,"(Your people) the Quraysh ((O Muhammad) have denied it) the Qur'an, (though it) the Qur'an (is the Truth. Say) O Muhammad: (I am not put in charge of you) I do not guarantee to take you to Allah as believers."
لِّكُلِّ نَبَإٍ مُّسْتَقَرٌّ وَسَوْفَ تَعْلَمُونَ,"(For every announcement there is a term) for every saying from Allah, and for every command, prohibition, promise, threat, glad tiding of victory or punishment that you receive from Me, there is a term-it is an act and fact from Him, some of which will happen in this world and some in the Hereafter, (and ye will come to know) of all of it in this world or in the Hereafter; it is also said that (For every announcement there is a term) means: every action and speech reflects a true meaning that is in your hearts, and you shall see what will be done with you."
وَإِذَا رَأَيْتَ ٱلَّذِينَ يَخُوضُونَ فِيۤ ءَايَاتِنَا فَأَعْرِضْ عَنْهُمْ حَتَّىٰ يَخُوضُواْ فِي حَدِيثٍ غَيْرِهِ وَإِمَّا يُنسِيَنَّكَ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنُ فَلاَ تَقْعُدْ بَعْدَ ٱلذِّكْرَىٰ مَعَ ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ,"(And when thou seest those who meddle with Our revelations) those who mock you and mock the Qur'an, (withdraw from them) leave their assembly (until they meddle with another topic) such that they talk about something other than the Qur'an and such that they cease mocking you. (And if the devil cause thee to forget) after being warned against it, (sit not, after the remembrance) after being reminded, (with the congregation of wrong-doers) the idolaters. Allah commanded His Prophet with this in Mecca, but the prophetic Companions found it hard to implement. They were later given dispensation to sit with the idolaters so as to admonish and warn them."
وَمَا عَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ يَتَّقُونَ مِنْ حِسَابِهِم مِّن شَيْءٍ وَلَـٰكِن ذِكْرَىٰ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَّقُونَ,"(Those who ward off (evil)) those who ward off disbelief, idolatry, indecencies and mockery (are not accountable for them) for their sins, disbelief and mockery towards the believers (in aught, but the Reminder) by means of the Qur'an ((must be given them) that haply they (too) may ward off (evil)) disbelief, idolatry, indecencies and mocking the Qur'an and Muhammad (pbuh)."

(Remind (mankind) hereby) admonish through the Qur'an; it is also said this means: admonish by Allah (lest a soul be destroyed) be weakened and punished (by what it earneth) of sins. (It) the soul (hath beside Allah) against Allah's punishment (no friend) no close friend to defend it (nor intercessor) to intercede for it, (and though it offer every compensation) even if it brings all that which is on the face of the earth to compensate for it (it will not be accepted from it. Those) who mock (are they who perish) to be humiliated and punished; these are 'Uyaynah, al-Nadr and their folk, (by their own deserts) because of their own sins. (For them is drink of boiling water and a painful doom, because they disbelieved) in Muhammad and the Qur'an."
قُلْ أَنَدْعُواْ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ مَا لاَ يَنفَعُنَا وَلاَ يَضُرُّنَا وَنُرَدُّ عَلَىٰ أَعْقَابِنَا بَعْدَ إِذْ هَدَانَا ٱللَّهُ كَٱلَّذِي ٱسْتَهْوَتْهُ ٱلشَّيَاطِينُ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ حَيْرَانَ لَهُ أَصْحَابٌ يَدْعُونَهُ إِلَى ٱلْهُدَى ٱئْتِنَا قُلْ إِنَّ هُدَى ٱللَّهِ هُوَ ٱلْهُدَىٰ وَأُمِرْنَا لِنُسْلِمَ لِرَبِّ ٱلْعَالَمِينَ,"(Say) O Muhammad, to 'Uyaynah and his folk: (Shall we cry) do you ask us to worship (instead of unto Allah, unto that which neither profiteth us) if we worshipped it, neither in this world nor in the Hereafter (nor hurteth us) if we did not worship it, neither in this world nor in the Next, (and shall we turn back) to idolatry (after Allah hath guided us) has honoured us with His religion, (like) if we were to do so, we would be like (one bewildered) erred from guidance (whom the devils have infatuated) lured down (in the earth, who hath companions) 'Uyaynah has friends, the prophetic Companions (who invite him to the guidance) to Islam ((saying): Come unto us) obey us? While 'Uyaynah was inviting them to idolatry. It is also said that this verse was revealed about Abu Bakr and his son 'Abd al-Rahman. Prior to embracing Islam, 'Abd al-Rahman used to invite his parents to his religion. Allah said to his Prophet: tell Abu Bakr to say to his son 'Abd al-Rahman: are you asking us O 'Abd al-Rahman, to worship, instead of Allah, that which does not benefit us in this world in our provision or livelihood or in the Hereafter if we were to worship it, nor hurt us, if we did not worship it? Are you really asking us to return to our old religion after Allah has guided us to the religion of Muhammad (pbuh). If we were to do as you ask us, we would be like 'Abd al-Rahman who erred and whom the devils lured away from Allah's religion. The parents of 'Abd al-Rahman-Abu Bakr and his wife-invited him to Islam and repentance, while he invited them to idolatry. His parents say to him: obey us and embrace Islam. (Say) O Muhammad: (Lo! the guidance of Allah is Guidance) the religion of Allah is Islam and our Qiblah is the Ka'bah, (and we are ordered to surrender) to make our worship and confession of Allah's divine Oneness sincere (to the Lord of the Worlds) to Allah, Lord of the Worlds,"
وَأَنْ أَقِيمُواْ ٱلصَّلاةَ وَٱتَّقُوهُ وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِيۤ إِلَيْهِ تُحْشَرُونَ,"(And to establish worship) the five daily prayers (and ward off (evil)) obey Allah, (and He it is unto Whom ye will be gathered) after you die and will reward you for your works."

(In that day when He saith) to the wall: (Be! it is) i.e. the heavens will become a wall which will be blown into, like one blows into a horn. Then the heaven will be changed into a different heaven; it is also said that (Be! it is) means: when He says to the Day of Judgement: “Be”, and it will be. (His word) regarding the resurrection (is the Truth, and His will be the Sovereignty) the judgement between the servants (on the Day when the trumpet is blown. Knower of the invisible) that which will happen in the future (and the visible) that which has already happened; it is also said that the 'invisible' refers to that which is unseen by people while 'the visible' refers to that which Allah's servants see, (He is the Wise) in His command and decree, (the Aware) of His created beings and of their works."
وَإِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ لأَبِيهِ آزَرَ أَتَتَّخِذُ أَصْنَاماً آلِهَةً إِنِّيۤ أَرَاكَ وَقَوْمَكَ فِي ضَلاَلٍ مُّبِينٍ,"((Remember) when Abraham said unto his father Azar) who was Terah the son of Nahur: (Takest thou idols) do you worship idols (for gods) so many gods: small and large, male and female? (Lo! I see thee) O my father (and thy folk in error manifest) in manifest disbelief and wrong in so worshipping idols."
وَكَذَلِكَ نُرِيۤ إِبْرَاهِيمَ مَلَكُوتَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَلِيَكُونَ مِنَ ٱلْمُوقِنِينَ,"(Thus did We show Abraham the kingdom of the heavens and the earth) that which is between the heavens and the earth: the sun, the moon and the stars when he came out of the hole into which he was thrown (that he might be of those possessing certainty) that he might be of those who acknowledge that Allah is One, the Creator of the heavens and the earth and all that which is in them; it is also said that Allah showed him this on the night He made him ascend to heaven. He saw up to the seventh heaven and the seventh earth, so that he may have the certitude of inspiration:"
فَلَمَّا جَنَّ عَلَيْهِ ٱلْلَّيْلُ رَأَى كَوْكَباً قَالَ هَـٰذَا رَبِّي فَلَمَّآ أَفَلَ قَالَ لاۤ أُحِبُّ ٱلآفِلِينَ,"(When the night grew dark upon him) in the hole (he beheld a star) the planet Venus. (He said: This is my Lord) could this be my Lord? (But when it set) when its colour changed to red and it disappeared, (he said: I love not things that set) I do not love a lord that is not lasting."
فَلَمَّآ رَأَى ٱلْقَمَرَ بَازِغاً قَالَ هَـٰذَا رَبِّي فَلَمَّآ أَفَلَ قَالَ لَئِن لَّمْ يَهْدِنِي رَبِّي لأَكُونَنَّ مِنَ ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلضَّالِّينَ,"(And when he saw the moon uprising, he exclaimed: This my Lord) could this be my Lord? This is bigger than the first one. (But when it set, he said: Unless my Lord guide me) unless my Lord makes me firm on guidance, (I surely shall become one of the folk who are astray) from guidance."
فَلَماَّ رَأَى ٱلشَّمْسَ بَازِغَةً قَالَ هَـٰذَا رَبِّي هَـٰذَآ أَكْبَرُ فَلَمَّآ أَفَلَتْ قَالَ يٰقَوْمِ إِنِّي بَرِيۤءٌ مِّمَّا تُشْرِكُونَ,"(And when he saw the sun uprising) filling everything [with its light], (he cried: This is my Lord!) Could this be my Lord? (This is greater!) This is bigger than the first and the second. (And when it set) when it disappeared, Abraham said: I do not love a lord who is not lasting. If Allah does not guide me, I shall be of those who err. It is also said that Abraham said 'this is my Lord' mocking his people, for his people worshipped the sun, the moon and the stars. He therefore objected to such worship by mocking them, saying to them: could the like of these be a Lord? When he emerged from the hole and went to his people-he was then 17 years old-he looked at the sky and the earth and then said: my Lord is Him Who has created this. He then proceeded until he found a group of his people attending with devotion to their idols, (he exclaimed: O my people! Lo! I am free from all that ye associate (with Him)) of idols."
إِنِّي وَجَّهْتُ وَجْهِيَ لِلَّذِي فَطَرَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضَ حَنِيفاً وَمَآ أَنَاْ مِنَ ٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ,"When they asked him: who do you worship? He said: (Lo! I have turned my face towards) I have made my religion and works sincere to (him Who created the heavens and the earth, as one by nature upright) Muslim, (and I am not of the idolaters) who follows their religion."
وَحَآجَّهُ قَوْمُهُ قَالَ أَتُحَٰجُّوۤنِّي فِي ٱللَّهِ وَقَدْ هَدَانِ وَلاَ أَخَافُ مَا تُشْرِكُونَ بِهِ إِلاَّ أَن يَشَآءَ رَبِّي شَيْئاً وَسِعَ رَبِّي كُلَّ شَيْءٍ عِلْماً أَفَلاَ تَتَذَكَّرُونَ,(His people argued with him) regarding their gods and threatened him by them so that he would leave the religion of Allah. (He) Abraham (said: Dispute ye with me concerning Allah) do you argue with me in favour of your gods and threaten me so that I might leave the religion of my Lord (when He hath guided me) to His religion? (I fear not at all that which ye set beside Him) i.e. idols (unless my Lord willeth aught) to take away the knowledge from my heart such that I fear what you do. (My Lord includeth all things in His knowledge) my Lord knows that you do not follow the Truth: (Will ye not then remember) take admonition from the warning I am telling you about?
وَكَيْفَ أَخَافُ مَآ أَشْرَكْتُمْ وَلاَ تَخَافُونَ أَنَّكُمْ أَشْرَكْتُم بِٱللَّهِ مَا لَمْ يُنَزِّلْ بِهِ عَلَيْكُمْ سُلْطَٰناً فَأَيُّ ٱلْفَرِيقَيْنِ أَحَقُّ بِٱلأَمْنِ إِن كُنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ,"(How should I fear that which ye set up beside Him) of idols, (when ye fear not) Allah (to set up beside Allah that for which He hath revealed unto you no warrant) no Scripture or proof?

(Which of the two factions) which of the adherents of the two religions: you or I (hath more right to safety) from the God Whom he worships? ((Answer me that) if ye have knowledge) of this."

(Say) O Muhammad, to the people of Mecca: (I ask of you no fee) no wage (for it) for Allah's divine Oneness or for the Qur'an. (Lo! It) the Qur'an (is naught but a Reminder) an admonition (to (His) creatures) the jinn and human beings."

This verse was revealed about Malik Ibn al-Sayf, the Jew, who claimed that Allah did not reveal any Scripture to human beings. (Say) O Muhammad, to Malik: (Who revealed the Book which Moses brought, a light) an exposition and enlightenment (and guidance for mankind) from error, (which ye have put) written (on parchments which ye show) many things which do not contain the traits and description of the Prophet (pbuh) (but ye hide much (thereof)) you hide many portions of it which contain the traits and description of Muhammad (pbuh) (and by which ye were taught) of legal rulings, punishment, the lawful and the unlawful as well as the traits and description of Muhammad (pbuh) in the Scripture (that which ye knew not yourselves nor (did) your fathers (know it)) before the revelation of legal rulings and punishments? If they answer and say it was Allah, then fine, if they do not, (Say: Allah) revealed it. (Then leave them to their play of cavilling) let them indulge in their falsehood: quibbling and lying."

(But lo! Many) Abu'l-Ahwas and his folk (are led astray by their own lusts) call on you to eat the meat of carrion (through ignorance) or proof. (Lo! your Lord, He is best aware of the transgressors) who move from the lawful to that which is unlawful."
وَذَرُواْ ظَٰهِرَ ٱلإِثْمِ وَبَاطِنَهُ إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يَكْسِبُونَ ٱلإِثْمَ سَيُجْزَوْنَ بِمَا كَانُواْ يَقْتَرِفُونَ,"(Forsake the outwardness of sin) the adultery of the outward (and the inwardness thereof) secret adultery, i.e. taking lovers in secret. (Lo! those who garner sin) those who commit adultery (will be awarded) a lashing in this world and punishment in the Hereafter because of (that which they have earned) i.e. committing adultery."
وَلاَ تَأْكُلُواْ مِمَّا لَمْ يُذْكَرِ ٱسْمُ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْهِ وَإِنَّهُ لَفِسْقٌ وَإِنَّ ٱلشَّيَٰطِينَ لَيُوحُونَ إِلَىۤ أَوْلِيَآئِهِمْ لِيُجَٰدِلُوكُمْ وَإِنْ أَطَعْتُمُوهُمْ إِنَّكُمْ لَمُشْرِكُونَ,"(And eat not of that whereon Allah's name hath not been mentioned) of immolated animals intentionally, (for lo! it is abomination) i.e. eating it without a necessity is a sin and declaring it lawful, in denial of the revelation, is an act of disbelief. (Lo! the devils do inspire) whisper to (their minions) Abu'l-Ahwas and his folk (to dispute with you) regarding the consumption of the meat of carrion, idolatry and about the angels being the daughters of Allah. (But if you obey them) in their idolatry and the consumption of the meat of carrion, declaring it lawful without being in dire need of it, (ye will be in truth idolaters) like them."
أَوَ مَن كَانَ مَيْتاً فَأَحْيَيْنَٰهُ وَجَعَلْنَا لَهُ نُوراً يَمْشِي بِهِ فِي ٱلنَّاسِ كَمَن مَّثَلُهُ فِي ٱلظُّلُمَٰتِ لَيْسَ بِخَارِجٍ مِّنْهَا كَذَلِكَ زُيِّنَ لِلْكَٰفِرِينَ مَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ,"(Is he who was dead) i.e. the disbeliever; this verse was revealed about 'Ammar Ibn Yasir, Abu Jahl Ibn Hisham (and We have raised him unto life) and We honoured him with faith, referring to 'Ammar Ibn Yasir, (and set for him a light) knowledge (wherein he walketh) wherein he is guided (among men) it is also said that (and set for him a light) means: We set for him a light on the Bridge over hell in the midst of people, (as him whose similitude is in utter darkness) the error of disbelief in this world and the darkness of Gehenna on the Day of Judgement, the reference here is to Abu Jahl (whence he cannot emerge) he cannot free himself from disbelief and error in this world nor from the darkness in the Hereafter? (Thus is their conduct made fair-seeming for the disbelievers) thus We made his works seem fair to Abu Jahl."
وَكَذٰلِكَ جَعَلْنَا فِي كُلِّ قَرْيَةٍ أَكَٰبِرَ مُجْرِمِيهَا لِيَمْكُرُواْ فِيهَا وَمَا يَمْكُرُونَ إِلاَّ بِأَنْفُسِهِمْ وَمَا يَشْعُرُونَ,"(And thus have We made in every city great ones of its wicked ones) their leaders, tyrants and wealthy citizens, as We made in the city of Mecca those who sneer and their friend, Abu Jahl and his folk, (that they should plot therein) that they should engage in transgression and corruption; it is also said that this means: so that they deny therein the prophets. (They do but plot against themselves) He says: the punishment and ruination of the transgressions and corruption they commit will be to their detriment, (though they perceive not) this."
وَإِذَا جَآءَتْهُمْ آيَةٌ قَالُواْ لَن نُّؤْمِنَ حَتَّىٰ نُؤْتَىٰ مِثْلَ مَآ أُوتِيَ رُسُلُ ٱللَّهِ ٱللَّهُ أَعْلَمُ حَيْثُ يَجْعَلُ رِسَالَتَهُ سَيُصِيبُ ٱلَّذِينَ أَجْرَمُواْ صَغَارٌ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ وَعَذَابٌ شَدِيدٌ بِمَا كَانُواْ يَمْكُرُونَ,"(And when a token cometh unto them) when a verse comes down from heaven informing of what al-Walid Ibn al-Mughirah, 'Abd Yalayl and Abu Mas'ud al-Thaqafi were doing, (they say: We will not believe) in this verse (till we are given) the Scripture like (that which Allah's messengers are given) meaning Muhammad (pbuh). (Allah knoweth best with whom to place His message) He knows best to whom He sends Gabriel with His message. (Humiliation) degradation and abasement (from Allah and heavy punishment will smite the guilty) the idolaters, i.e. al-Walid and his friends (for their scheming) for their denial of the messengers."

(Thus Allah layeth ignominy) Allah leaves denial (upon those) in the heart of those (who believe not) in Muhammad (pbuh), or in the Qur'an, and then He punishes them for their disbelief."
وَهَـٰذَا صِرَاطُ رَبِّكَ مُسْتَقِيماً قَدْ فَصَّلْنَا ٱلآيَاتِ لِقَوْمٍ يَذَّكَّرُونَ,"(This is the path of thy Lord) this is the doing of your Lord, (a straight path) a just path; it is also said this means: This Islam is the religion of your Lord which He is pleased with; it is straight and well established. (We have detailed Our revelations) i.e. the Qur'an, by explaining the commands and prohibitions, the causes of humiliation and the reasons for honour (for a people who take heed) for a people who understand and therefore believe. It is also said that (And whomsoever it is Allah's will to guide) was revealed about the Prophet (pbuh) and Abu Jahl; it is also said to have been revealed about 'Ammar Ibn Yasir and Abu Jahl."

Many of humankind did ye seduce) how many human beings have erred by seeking help in you. (And their adherents) the adherents of the jinn (among humankind) who sought help in the leaders of the jinn upon camping at a valley or hunting a beast of theirs, used to say: 'we seek refuge in the master of this valley from the foolish among his people', and used to feel safe after saying this, (will say: Our Lord!) O our Lord! (We enjoyed one another) we benefited from one another; the benefit of the human beings was safety from the jinn, and that of the jinn, their status and position among their people (but now we have arrived at the appointed term which Thou appointedst for us) i.e. death. (He) Allah (will say) to them: (Fire is your home) is your dwelling, O group of jinn. (Abide therein for ever) abiding in the Fire, (save him whom Allah willeth (to deliver)) but Allah wills that they abide therein for eternity. (Lo! thy Lord is Wise) He decreed that they will abide in hell for ever, (Aware) of them and of their punishment."

Came there not unto you messengers of your own) i.e. human messengers: Muhammad (pbuh) and all other messengers, and among the jinn, the nine who came to the Prophet (pbuh) and then went back to their people to deliver the message; it is also said that the jinn had a prophet of their own called Joseph, (who recounted) recited (unto you My tokens) detailing commands and prohibitions (and warned you of the meeting) the punishment (of this your Day? They) the humans and jinn (will say: We testify against ourselves) that they delivered the message and that we disbelieved them. Allah said: (And the life of the world) that which is in the life of this world of comfort and enjoyment (beguiled them. And they testify against themselves) in the Hereafter (that they were disbelievers) in the life of this world."

Thus that which (they assign) unto His partners) their gods (in them reacheth not Allah) does not go to that which they have assigned to Allah (and that which (they assign) unto Allah goeth to your (so called) partners) so called gods. (Evil is their ordinance) evil is that which they decree for themselves."

Had Allah willed (it otherwise), they had not done so) i.e. killing their daughters and making it seem fair to them. (So leave them alone with their devices) with their lies when they claim that Allah commanded them to bury their daughters alive."

No one is to eat of them save whom We will in their make believe) they means men to the exclusion of women (cattle whose backs are forbidden) i.e. what is known as al-Ham, (cattle over which they mention not the name of Allah) when they get pregnant or deliver, this is what is called al-Bahirah. ((All that is) a lie against Him) i.e. that He commanded them to do so. (He will repay them for that which they invent) for lying against Him."
وَقَالُواْ مَا فِي بُطُونِ هَـٰذِهِ ٱلأَنْعَٰمِ خَالِصَةٌ لِّذُكُورِنَا وَمُحَرَّمٌ عَلَىٰ أَزْوَٰجِنَا وَإِن يَكُن مَّيْتَةً فَهُمْ فِيهِ شُرَكَآءُ سَيَجْزِيهِمْ وَصْفَهُمْ إِنَّهُ حِكِيمٌ عَلِيمٌ,"(And they say: That which is in the bellies of such cattle) i.e. al-Bahirah and al-Wasilah (is reserved) lawful (for our males) men (and is forbidden to our wives; but if it be born dead) or dies consequently, (then they (all)) males and females (may be partakers thereof) in eating its meat. (He will reward them) this is a threat to them (for their attribution (ordinances unto Him)) it is also said that this means: He will reward them with what will happen to them. This is because the Prophet (pbuh) saw 'Amr ibn Luhayy, who taught them the unlawfulness of the cattle described above, dragging his guts from his behind. (Lo, He is Wise) He made that which is lawful permitted, (Aware) of their ascription of unlawfulness to things that are lawful."

They indeed have gone astray) they are in error about what they say (and are not guided) to the guidance and right in that which they ascribe unlawfulness."

(Eat you of the fruit thereof) of the fruit of the palm-tree (when it fruits) when it ripens, (and pay the due thereof upon the harvest day) it could also mean upon measuring it, (and be not prodigal) do not spend in disobedience of Allah nor prevent the obedience of Allah; it is also said that this means: do not forbid the Bahirah, the Sa'ibah, the Wasilah and the Ham. (Lo! Allah loveth not the prodigals) those who spend in disobedience of Allah; or it could mean: the idolaters. It is said that this verse was revealed about Thabit Ibn Qays who collected with his own hands the harvest of 500 palm-trees and gave it away, not leaving a thing for his own family."

(Eat of that which Allah hath bestowed upon you) of crops and cattle, (and follow not the footsteps of the devil) what the devil has made seem fair by forbidding some crops and cattle, (for lo! he is an open foe to you) whose enmity is quite manifest, for he commands you to forbid some crops and cattle."

(Say) to Malik, O Muhammad: (Hath He forbidden the two males or the two females) is the prohibition of the Bahirah and Wasilah because of the fluids of the two males or those of the two females, (or that which the wombs of the two females contain) before copulation? (Expound to me (the case) with knowledge, if ye are truthful) that Allah has made unlawful that which you claim."

(Say) O Muhammad, to Malik: (Hath He forbidden the two males or the two females) is the prohibition of the Bahirah and Wasilah because of the fluids of the two males or those of the two females, (or that which the wombs of the two females contain) before copulation? Another way of understanding this is as follows: is this prohibited because what is delivered is male or because it is female? (or were ye by to witness when Allah commanded you (all) this) all that you claim? (Then who doth greater wrong) who is more insolent and bolder vis-à-vis Allah (than he who deviseth) invents (a lie concerning Allah, that he may lead mankind astray) from Allah's religion and obedience (without knowledge) from Allah. (Lo! Allah guideth not) does not direct to His religion and proof (wrong-doing folk) the idolaters, meaning: Malik Ibn 'Awf."

Instead, he said: “Let me hear from you, O Muhammad, why our forefathers forbade them”. So Allah said: (Say) O Muhammad: (I find not in that which is revealed unto me) i.e. the Qur'an (aught prohibited to an eater that he eat thereof, except it be carrion, or blood poured forth, or swine flesh for that verily is foul) unlawful (or the abomination) an immolated animal (which was immolated to the name of other than Allah) intentionally. (But whoso is compelled (thereto)) whoever is forced to eat the meat of carrion, (neither craving) i.e. without infringement on Muslims nor deeming the meat of carrion lawful in other than necessity (nor transgressing) nor committing highway robbery or intentionally eating of the meat of carrion without being compelled to do so, ((for him) lo! your Lord is Forgiving) if he eats to satiety, (Merciful) in that which He made dispensation for him. However, he ought not to eat to satiety, and if he does, Allah will pardon him."

(And of the oxen and the sheep forbade We unto them the fat thereof) i.e. the fat spread between the bowels and intestines and the fat spread over the kidneys (save that upon the backs or the entrails, or that which is mixed with the bone) such as the tail; all these were lawful for them. (That) which We made unlawful for them (We awarded them) We punished them (for their rebellion) because of their transgression We made all these forbidden for them. (And lo! We verily are Truthful) in what We have said."
فَإِن كَذَّبُوكَ فَقُلْ رَّبُّكُمْ ذُو رَحْمَةٍ وَاسِعَةٍ وَلاَ يُرَدُّ بَأْسُهُ عَنِ ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلْمُجْرِمِينَ,"(So if they give the lie to thee) O Muhammad regarding the prohibitions that We described to you, (say: Your Lord is a Lord of all-embracing mercy) towards the pious and sinner alike, in that He defers torment to the next life, (and His wrath) His torment (will never be withdrawn from guilty folk) the idolaters."
سَيَقُولُ ٱلَّذِينَ أَشْرَكُواْ لَوْ شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ مَآ أَشْرَكْنَا وَلاَ آبَاؤُنَا وَلاَ حَرَّمْنَا مِن شَيْءٍ كَذٰلِكَ كَذَّبَ ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِم حَتَّىٰ ذَاقُواْ بَأْسَنَا قُلْ هَلْ عِندَكُم مِّنْ عِلْمٍ فَتُخْرِجُوهُ لَنَآ إِن تَتَّبِعُونَ إِلاَّ ٱلظَّنَّ وَإِنْ أَنتُمْ إَلاَّ تَخْرُصُونَ,"(They who are idolaters will say: Had Allah willed, we had not ascribed (unto Him) partners neither had our fathers nor had we forbidden aught) of crops and cattle, but this has been commanded and forbidden for us. (Thus) just as did your people give the lie (did those who were before them give the lie) to their messengers (till they tasted of the fear of Us) Our torment. (Say) O Muhammad: (Have ye any knowledge) any clarification regarding what you describe as unlawful (that ye can adduce for us? Lo! ye follow naught but an opinion) your prohibition of crops and cattle is nothing but surmise. (Lo! Ye do but guess) you just lie."
قُلْ فَلِلَّهِ ٱلْحُجَّةُ ٱلْبَالِغَةُ فَلَوْ شَآءَ لَهَدَاكُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ,"(Say) to them, O Muhammad, if you do not have an argument for your claim, then (For Allah's is the final argument) the most firm argument. (Had He willed He could indeed have guided all of you) to His religion."
قُلْ هَلُمَّ شُهَدَآءَكُمُ ٱلَّذِينَ يَشْهَدُونَ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ حَرَّمَ هَـٰذَا فَإِن شَهِدُواْ فَلاَ تَشْهَدْ مَعَهُمْ وَلاَ تَتَّبِعْ أَهْوَآءَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَذَّبُواْ بِآيَاتِنَا وَٱلَّذِينَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱلآخِرَةِ وَهُم بِرَبِّهِمْ يَعْدِلُونَ,"(Say) to them, O Muhammad: (Come, bring your witnesses who can bear witness that Allah forbade (all) this) that you claim of crops and cattle. (And if they) falsely (bear witness) that they are forbidden, (do not you bear witness with them. Follow thou not the whims of those who deny Our revelations) i.e. the Qur'an, (those who believe not in the Hereafter) in resurrection after death (and deem (others) equal with their Lord) take idols as His partners."
قُلْ تَعَالَوْاْ أَتْلُ مَا حَرَّمَ رَبُّكُمْ عَلَيْكُمْ أَلاَّ تُشْرِكُواْ بِهِ شَيْئاً وَبِٱلْوَالِدَيْنِ إِحْسَاناً وَلاَ تَقْتُلُوۤاْ أَوْلاَدَكُمْ مِّنْ إمْلاَقٍ نَّحْنُ نَرْزُقُكُمْ وَإِيَّاهُمْ وَلاَ تَقْرَبُواْ ٱلْفَوَاحِشَ مَا ظَهَرَ مِنْهَا وَمَا بَطَنَ وَلاَ تَقْتُلُواْ ٱلنَّفْسَ ٱلَّتِي حَرَّمَ ٱللَّهُ إِلاَّ بِٱلْحَقِّ ذٰلِكُمْ وَصَّاكُمْ بِهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ,"(Say) O Muhammad to Malik Ibn 'Awf and his fellows: (Come, I will recite unto you that which your Lord hath made a sacred duty for you) in the Scripture that was revealed to me: (that ye ascribe no thing as partner unto Him) the first thing is that you do not associate with Him any of the idols (and that you do good to parents) you be dutiful to parents, (and that ye slay not your children) your daughters (because of penury) out of fear of humiliation and poverty. (We provide for you and for them) i.e. for your children (and that ye draw not nigh to lewd things) fornication (whether open) i.e. open fornication (or concealed) taking lovers in secret. (And that ye slay not the life which Allah hath made sacred, save in the course of justice) as a result of cases such as retaliation, stoning, apostasy. (This He hath commanded you) in the Qur'an, (in order that you may discern) His command and divine Oneness."
وَلاَ تَقْرَبُواْ مَالَ ٱلْيَتِيمِ إِلاَّ بِٱلَّتِي هِيَ أَحْسَنُ حَتَّىٰ يَبْلُغَ أَشُدَّهُ وَأَوْفُواْ ٱلْكَيْلَ وَٱلْمِيزَانَ بِٱلْقِسْطِ لاَ نُكَلِّفُ نَفْساً إِلاَّ وُسْعَهَا وَإِذَا قُلْتُمْ فَٱعْدِلُواْ وَلَوْ كَانَ ذَا قُرْبَىٰ وَبِعَهْدِ ٱللَّهِ أَوْفُواْ ذٰلِكُمْ وَصَّـٰكُمْ بِهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَذَكَّرُونَ,"(And approach not the wealth of the orphan save with that which is better) through protecting it and making it grow; (till he reach maturity) legal age and shows righteousness in his character. (Give full measure and full weight, in justice. We task not any soul) upon measuring and weighing (beyond its scope) beyond its effort to establish justice. (And if you give your word, do justice thereunto) be truthful, (even though it be (against) a kinsman) you should be truthful and say what is true; (and fulfil the covenant of Allah. This He commandeth you that haply ye may remember) haply you may heed the admonition."
وَأَنَّ هَـٰذَا صِرَاطِي مُسْتَقِيماً فَٱتَّبِعُوهُ وَلاَ تَتَّبِعُواْ ٱلسُّبُلَ فَتَفَرَّقَ بِكُمْ عَن سَبِيلِهِ ذٰلِكُمْ وَصَّاكُمْ بِهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ,"(And (He commandeth you, saying): This) Islam (is My straight path) it is well established and I am pleased with it, (so follow it. Follow not other ways) i.e. Judaism, Christianity and Zoroastrianism, (lest ye be parted from His way) from His religion: (This hath He ordained for you) He commanded for you in the Book, (that ye may ward off (evil)) that you may ward off these different ways."
ثُمَّ آتَيْنَا مُوسَى ٱلْكِتَابَ تَمَاماً عَلَى ٱلَّذِيۤ أَحْسَنَ وَتَفْصِيلاً لِّكُلِّ شَيْءٍ وَهُدًى وَرَحْمَةً لَّعَلَّهُمْ بِلِقَآءِ رَبِّهِمْ يُؤْمِنُونَ,"(Again, We gave the Scripture) the Torah (unto Moses, complete) with commands and prohibitions, promises and threats, reward and punishment (for him who would do good) for him who is in a good state; it is also said that this means: for him who follows the excellence of Moses and the conveyance of the message of his Lord, (an explanation of all things) He says: it is an exposition of all things regarding the lawful and the unlawful, (a guidance) from error (and a mercy) that absolves the one who believes in Allah from His torment, (that they might believe in the meeting with their Lord) that they might believe in resurrection after death."
وَهَـٰذَا كِتَٰبٌ أَنزَلْنَـٰهُ مُبَارَكٌ فَٱتَّبِعُوهُ وَٱتَّقُواْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُرْحَمُونَ,"(And this is a blessed) comprises mercy and forgiveness for the person who believes (Scripture) i.e. the Qur'an (which We have revealed) which We have sent Gabriel with. (So follow it) follow its lawful and unlawful, commands and prohibitions (and ward off (evil)) ward off other than it, (that ye may find mercy) and not be tormented."
أَن تَقُولُوۤاْ إِنَّمَآ أُنزِلَ ٱلْكِتَابُ عَلَىٰ طَآئِفَتَيْنِ مِن قَبْلِنَا وَإِن كُنَّا عَن دِرَاسَتِهِمْ لَغَافِلِينَ,"(Lest ye should say) so that you will not say, O people of Mecca, on the Day of Judgement: (The Scripture was revealed only to two sects) the people of two religions (before us) i.e. the Jews and Christians, (and we in sooth were unaware) ignorant (of what they read) their reading of the Torah and the Gospel;"
أَوْ تَقُولُواْ لَوْ أَنَّآ أُنزِلَ عَلَيْنَا ٱلْكِتَابُ لَكُنَّآ أَهْدَىٰ مِنْهُمْ فَقَدْ جَآءَكُمْ بَيِّنَةٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَهُدًى وَرَحْمَةٌ فَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّن كَذَّبَ بِآيَاتِ ٱللَّهِ وَصَدَفَ عَنْهَا سَنَجْزِي ٱلَّذِينَ يَصْدِفُونَ عَنْ آيَاتِنَا سُوۤءَ ٱلْعَذَابِ بِمَا كَانُواْ يَصْدِفُونَ,"(Or lest you should say) and so that you will not say on the Day of Judgement: (If the Scripture had been revealed unto us) as it was revealed to the Jews and Christians, (we surely had been better guided than are they) we would be swifter in answering the Messenger and we would also have a sounder religion. (Now hath there come unto you a clear proof) a clarification (from your Lord) i.e. the Qur'an and the Messenger, (a guidance) from error (and a mercy) for the one who believes in him; (and who doeth greater wrong) who is more insolent and more daring vis-à-vis Allah (than he who denieth the revelations of Allah) who denies Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an, (and turneth away from them? We award unto those who turn away from Our revelations) Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an (an evil doom) a severe torment (because of their aversion) vis-à-vis Muhammad and the Qur'an."
هَلْ يَنظُرُونَ إِلاَّ أَن تَأْتِيهُمُ ٱلْمَلاۤئِكَةُ أَوْ يَأْتِيَ رَبُّكَ أَوْ يَأْتِيَ بَعْضُ ءَايَاتِ رَبِّكَ يَوْمَ يَأْتِي بَعْضُ ءَايَاتِ رَبِّكَ لاَ يَنفَعُ نَفْساً إِيمَٰنُهَا لَمْ تَكُنْ ءَامَنَتْ مِن قَبْلُ أَوْ كَسَبَتْ فِيۤ إِيمَٰنِهَا خَيْراً قُلِ ٱنتَظِرُوۤاْ إِنَّا مُنتَظِرُونَ,"(Wait they) i.e. the people of Mecca, (indeed, for nothing less than that the angels should come unto them) to take their souls away at the moment of death, (or thy Lord should come) on the Day of Judgement, and His coming is without modality, (or there should come one of the portents from thy Lord) i.e. the rising of the sun from the West? (In the day when one of the portents from they Lord cometh) before the rising of the sun from the West, (its belief availeth naught a soul which theretofore) before the rising of the sun from the West (believed not, nor in its belief earned good) nor was it sincere in its belief, nor doing any good works before the rising of the sun from the West. This is because no faith, works or repentance are accepted from an unbeliever who embraces Islam upon seeing the sun rise from the West, unless that person is young at that time or is born after. In such a case, if he leaves Islam after the sun rises from the West and then returns to Islam, his repentance is accepted. Likewise, the repentance of a sinning believer who repents of his sins after the sun rises from the West is accepted. (Say) O Muhammad to the people of Mecca: (Wait you) the Day of Judgement! (Lo! We (too) are waiting) for your punishment on the Day of Judgement or before the Day of Judgement; it is also said that this means: Say, O Muhammad, wait for my destruction, I am also waiting for yours."
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ فَرَّقُواْ دِينَهُمْ وَكَانُواْ شِيَعاً لَّسْتَ مِنْهُمْ فِي شَيْءٍ إِنَّمَآ أَمْرُهُمْ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ ثُمَّ يُنَبِّئُهُم بِمَا كَانُواْ يَفْعَلُونَ,"(Lo! As for those who sunder their religion) those who have left the religion of their forefathers; it is also said that this means: those turned back on their pledge on the Day of the primordial Covenant; it can also be understood to mean: those who differed in their religion (and become schismatics) they became different groups: Judaism, Christianity and Zoroastrianism, (no concern at all hast thou with them) you are not required to fight them. However, he was later commanded to fight them. It is also said that this means: their repentance or punishment are not in your hands. (Their case will go to Allah, who then will tell them what they used to do) of good and evil."
مَن جَآءَ بِٱلْحَسَنَةِ فَلَهُ عَشْرُ أَمْثَالِهَا وَمَن جَآءَ بِٱلسَّيِّئَةِ فَلاَ يُجْزَىۤ إِلاَّ مِثْلَهَا وَهُمْ لاَ يُظْلَمُونَ,"(Whoso bringeth a good deed) while confessing Allah's divine Oneness (will receive tenfold the like thereof, while whoso bringeth an ill deed) while ascribing partners to Allah (will be awarded but the like thereof) i.e. the Fire; (and they will not be wronged) their good deeds will not be diminished nor will their bad deeds be increased."

As for me, my Lord hath guided me unto a straight path) my Lord has honoured me with His religion and has commanded me to call people to His religion; it is also said that this means: my Lord has shown how to call people to His to (a right religion, the community of Abraham) the religion of Abraham, (the upright) who surrendered to Allah and (who was no idolater) he did not follow the idolaters in their religion."
قُلْ إِنَّ صَلاَتِي وَنُسُكِي وَمَحْيَايَ وَمَمَاتِي لِلَّهِ رَبِّ ٱلْعَالَمِينَ,"(Say) O Muhammad: (Lo! my worship) the five daily prayers (and, my sacrifice) my religion, proof, sacrifice and worship (and my living and my dying are for Allah) in this world are for the sake of Allah's obedience and pleasure, (Lord of the Worlds) the Master of the jinn and human beings."

(Each soul earneth) of sins (only on its own account) as a punishment, (nor doth any laden bear another's load) of sins; it is also said that this means: no soul shall be taken to task for the sins of another soul; and it is also said that this means: no soul will be tormented for committing no sin; as it is said that this means: no soul bears the burden of another soul with pleasure; it does so only when it is forced. (Then unto your Lord is your return) after you die (and He will tell you that wherein) in Religion (you differed) you contravened."
وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِي جَعَلَكُمْ خَلاَئِفَ ٱلأَرْضِ وَرَفَعَ بَعْضَكُمْ فَوْقَ بَعْضٍ دَرَجَاتٍ لِّيَبْلُوَكُمْ فِي مَآ آتَاكُمْ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ سَرِيعُ ٱلْعِقَابِ وَإِنَّهُ لَغَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"(He it is who hath placed you as vicegerents of the earth) in the place of past nations (and hath exalted some of you in rank above others) in merit in terms of wealth and servants, (that He may try you) that He may test you (by (the test of) that which He hath given you) of wealth and servants. (Lo! Thy Lord is swift in prosecution) towards the one who disbelieves in Him or who does not give thanks to Him, (and lo! He is Forgiving) He pardons, (Merciful) towards the person who believes in Him'."
الۤمۤصۤ,And on his authority from Ibn 'Abbas who said concerning Allah's saying (Alif. Lam Mim. Sad) Allah says: I am Allah Who knows best and is best; it is also said that this is an oath by which Allah swore.
كِتَابٌ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ فَلاَ يَكُنْ فِي صَدْرِكَ حَرَجٌ مِّنْهُ لِتُنذِرَ بِهِ وَذِكْرَىٰ لِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,"((It is) a Scripture) this Scripture, i.e. the Qur'an (that is revealed unto thee (Muhammad)) that Gabriel brought to you (so let there be no heaviness in thy heart) let there be no doubt in your heart (therefrom) i.e. there can be no doubt about the Qur'an being from Allah (that thou mayst warn thereby) that you may warn the people of Mecca through the Qur'an in order that they believe, (and (it is) a Reminder unto believers)."

(Little give you thanks!) you do not give thanks for what is great nor for the small; it is also said that this means: you give little thanks for all that is done for you."
وَلَقَدْ خَلَقْنَاكُمْ ثُمَّ صَوَّرْنَاكُمْ ثُمَّ قُلْنَا لِلْمَلاۤئِكَةِ ٱسْجُدُواْ لأَدَمَ فَسَجَدُوۤاْ إِلاَّ إِبْلِيسَ لَمْ يَكُنْ مِّنَ ٱلسَّاجِدِينَ,"(And We created you) from Adam and Adam is from dust, (then fashioned you) in wombs, and We fashioned Adam between Mecca and Ta'if, (then told the angels) who were on the earth: (Fall ye prostrate before Adam) a prostration of greeting!

فَوَسْوَسَ لَهُمَا ٱلشَّيْطَانُ لِيُبْدِيَ لَهُمَا مَا وُورِيَ عَنْهُمَا مِن سَوْءَاتِهِمَا وَقَالَ مَا نَهَاكُمَا رَبُّكُمَا عَنْ هَـٰذِهِ ٱلشَّجَرَةِ إِلاَّ أَن تَكُونَا مَلَكَيْنِ أَوْ تَكُونَا مِنَ ٱلْخَالِدِينَ,"(Then Satan whispered to them) to eat from the tree (that he might manifest unto them that which was hidden from them) by the attire of light (of their shame) of their nakedness, (and he said) and Iblis said to them: (Your Lord forbade you) O Adam and Eve (from this tree only lest ye should become angels) who teach good and evil in Paradise (or become of the immortals) in Paradise: this is why He forbade you to eat from the tree."
وَقَاسَمَهُمَآ إِنِّي لَكُمَا لَمِنَ ٱلنَّاصِحِينَ,(And he swore unto them (saying): Lo! I am a sincere adviser unto you) in my oath that this is the tree of immortality.

(And when they tasted of the tree their shame) their nakedness (was manifest to them and they began) out of shame (to hide (by heaping) on themselves some of the leaves of the Garden) the leaves of the fig tree. (And their Lord called them) O Adam and Eve, ((saying): Did I not forbid you from that tree) from eating of that tree (and tell you: Lo! Satan) Iblis (is an open enemy to you) whose enmity is quite manifest?"
قَالاَ رَبَّنَا ظَلَمْنَآ أَنفُسَنَا وَإِن لَّمْ تَغْفِرْ لَنَا وَتَرْحَمْنَا لَنَكُونَنَّ مِنَ ٱلْخَاسِرِينَ,"(They said: Our Lord! We have wronged ourselves) we have harmed ourselves by transgressing.

Allah made these practices unlawful. (Say) O Muhammad: (Such) the good things, (on the Day of Resurrection, will be only for those who believed during the life of the world) in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an, while both believer and sinner will enjoy them during the life of this world. (Thus do We detail Our revelations) We elucidate the Qur'an by explaining the lawful and the unlawful (for people who have knowledge) for people who believe it is from Allah."

(On the day) which is the Day of Judgement (when the fulfilment thereof) when the consequence of what Allah has promised them in the Qur'an (cometh, those who were before forgetful thereof) those who did not believe in it in the life of this world (will say: The messengers of our Lord did bring the Truth!) with the exposition of the resurrection, Paradise and hell but we denied all. (Have we any intercessors, that they may intercede for us) to avoid the torment? (Or can we be returned) to life on earth, (that we may act) that we may believe and act (otherwise than we used to act) of idolatry? (They have lost their souls) by missing Paradise and abiding in hell, (and that which they devised) that which they worshipped falsely (hath failed them)."

(He covereth the night with the day) and the day with the night, (which is in haste to follow it) i.e. the day is in haste to follow the night and the night is in haste to follow the day, (and hath made the sun and the moon and the stars subservient by His command) by His leave. (His verily is all creation) the creation of the heavens and the earth (and commandment) i.e. the judgement of people on the Day of Judgement (Blessed be Allah) the Possessor of grace; it is also said that this means: elevated is Allah; as it is said that this means: far exalted is Allah, (the Lord of the Worlds!) the Master and Disposer of the Worlds."

وَلاَ تُفْسِدُواْ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ بَعْدَ إِصْلاَحِهَا وَٱدْعُوهُ خَوْفاً وَطَمَعاً إِنَّ رَحْمَتَ ٱللَّهِ قَرِيبٌ مِّنَ ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,"(Work not confusion) through sins and invitation to other than Allah (in the earth after the fair ordering (thereof)) through obedience and calling to Allah, Exalted is He, (and call on Him) worship Him (in fear) of Him and His torment (and hope) in Him that you shall enter His Paradise.

The hypocrite does not perform that which Allah commands him to do except when compelled and without a good disposition of the soul. (Thus do We recount the tokens) We expound the Qur'an by giving the simile of the believer and the disbeliever (for people who give thanks) for people who believe."

ٱلَّذِينَ كَذَّبُواْ شُعَيْباً كَأَن لَّمْ يَغْنَوْاْ فِيهَا ٱلَّذِينَ كَذَّبُواْ شُعَيْباً كَانُواْ هُمُ ٱلْخَاسِرِينَ,"(Those who denied Shu'ayb) were destroyed and (became as though they had not dwelt there. Those who denied Shu'ayb, they were the losers) in that they were punished."
فَتَوَلَّىٰ عَنْهُمْ وَقَالَ يٰقَوْمِ لَقَدْ أَبْلَغْتُكُمْ رِسَـٰلَـٰتِ رَبِّي وَنَصَحْتُ لَكُمْ فَكَيْفَ ءَاسَىٰ عَلَىٰ قَوْمٍ كَٰفِرِينَ,(So he turned from them) he departed from them before they were destroyed (and said: O my people! I delivered my Lord's messages unto you) by explaining the commands and prohibitions (and gave you good advice) I warned you of Allah's torment and invited you to repent and believe; (then how can I sorrow for a people that rejected) Allah and therefore were destroyed?
وَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَا فِي قَرْيَةٍ مِّن نَّبِيٍّ إِلاَّ أَخَذْنَا أَهْلَهَا بِٱلْبَأْسَآءِ وَٱلضَّرَّآءِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَضَّرَّعُونَ,"(And We sent no prophet) as messenger (unto any township) whose people We destroyed (but We did afflict its folk) before their destruction (with tribulation) with fear, affliction and hardships (and adversity) illness, pain and hunger (that haply they might grow humble) that haply they might believe, but they did not."
ثُمَّ بَدَّلْنَا مَكَانَ ٱلسَّيِّئَةِ ٱلْحَسَنَةَ حَتَّىٰ عَفَوْاْ وَّقَالُواْ قَدْ مَسَّ آبَاءَنَا ٱلضَّرَّآءُ وَٱلسَّرَّآءُ فَأَخَذْنَاهُمْ بَغْتَةً وَهُمْ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ,"(Then changed We the evil plight for good) We replaced drought and lack of fruit with fertility, abundance and comfort (till they grew affluent and said: Tribulation and distress did touch our fathers) as they have touched us, but they held firm to their religion. We are just like them and their example we shall follow. (Then We seized them unawares) with torment, (when they perceived not) the descent of such a torment."
وَلَوْ أَنَّ أَهْلَ ٱلْقُرَىٰ ءَامَنُواْ وَٱتَّقَواْ لَفَتَحْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ بَرَكَٰتٍ مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَلَـٰكِن كَذَّبُواْ فَأَخَذْنَٰهُمْ بِمَا كَانُواْ يَكْسِبُونَ,"(And if the people of the township) whose people We destroyed (had believed) in the Scripture and messengers (and kept from evil) disbelief, idolatry, indecencies and had further repented, (surely We should have opened for them, blessings from the sky) through rain (and from the earth) through vegetation and fruits. (But they gave the lie) to My messengers and Scriptures, (and so We seized them) by inflicting upon them drought, lack of fruits and punishment (on account of what they used to earn) i.e. because of giving the lie to the prophets and Scriptures."
أَفَأَمِنَ أَهْلُ ٱلْقُرَىٰ أَن يَأْتِيَهُمْ بَأْسُنَا بَيَٰتاً وَهُمْ نَآئِمُونَ,"(Are the people of the townships) the people of Mecca (then secure from the coming of Our wrath) Our punishment, (upon them as a night-raid while they sleep) and are completely unaware of it?"

أَفَأَمِنُواْ مَكْرَ ٱللَّهِ فَلاَ يَأْمَنُ مَكْرَ ٱللَّهِ إِلاَّ ٱلْقَوْمُ ٱلْخَاسِرُونَ,(Are they then secure from Allah's scheme) i.e. Allah's punishment? (None deemeth himself secure from Allah's scheme) Allah's punishment (save folk that perish) the disbelievers.
أَوَلَمْ يَهْدِ لِلَّذِينَ يَرِثُونَ ٱلأَرْضَ مِن بَعْدِ أَهْلِهَآ أَن لَّوْ نَشَآءُ أَصَبْنَاهُمْ بِذُنُوبِهِمْ وَنَطْبَعُ عَلَىٰ قُلُوبِهِمْ فَهُمْ لاَ يَسْمَعُونَ,"(Is it not an indication) is it not clear (to those who inherit the land) the land of Mecca (after its people) after the destruction of its people (that, if We will, We can smite them) punish them (for their sins) as We punished nations before them (and print upon) such that We seal (their hearts so that they hear not) guidance and believe not in Muhammad (pbuh) or the Qur'an?"

(We relate) We send you Gabriel with (some tidings of them) with the story of their destruction (unto thee (Muhammad). Their messengers verily came unto them with clear proofs) with commands, prohibitions and signs, (but they could not believe) in the Scriptures or messengers (because they had before denied) i.e. on the Day of the Covenant; it is also said the last of nations did not believe in that which the first of nations disbelieved. (Thus doth Allah print upon) seal (the hearts of disbelievers) in Allah as it is in the knowledge of Allah."
وَمَا وَجَدْنَا لأَكْثَرِهِم مِّنْ عَهْدٍ وَإِن وَجَدْنَآ أَكْثَرَهُمْ لَفَاسِقِينَ,"(We found no (loyalty to any) covenant) the first covenant (in most of them. Nay, most of them) all of them (We found wrong-doers) breakers of covenants."

(Now, see the nature of the consequence for the corrupters) see how destruction was the end result of the idolaters!"
وَقَالَ مُوسَىٰ يٰفِرْعَوْنُ إِنِّي رَسُولٌ مِّن رَّبِّ ٱلْعَالَمِينَ,"(Moses said: O Pharaoh! Lo! I am a messenger from the Lord of the Worlds) to you, but Pharaoh said: "" You are lying! """

So let the Children of Israel) along with their properties, great and small, (go with me)."
قَالَ إِن كُنتَ جِئْتَ بِآيَةٍ فَأْتِ بِهَآ إِن كُنتَ مِنَ ٱلصَّادِقِينَ,"((Pharaoh) said: If thou comest with a token) with a sign, (then produce it, if you are of those who speak the Truth) and if you are indeed a messenger."
فَأَلْقَىٰ عَصَاهُ فَإِذَا هِيَ ثُعْبَانٌ مُّبِينٌ,"(Then he flung down his staff) the first token (and lo! it was a serpent manifest) a yellow, male serpent: a huge one;"

قَالَ نَعَمْ وَإِنَّكُمْ لَمِنَ ٱلْمُقَرَّبِينَ,"(He answered: Yea) you have that, (and surely ye shall be of those brought near (to me)) in status."

قَالَ أَلْقُوْاْ فَلَمَّآ أَلْقَوْاْ سَحَرُوۤاْ أَعْيُنَ ٱلنَّاسِ وَٱسْتَرْهَبُوهُمْ وَجَآءُوا بِسِحْرٍ عَظِيمٍ,"(He) Moses (said: Throw) first whatever you are going to throw! (And when they threw) 70 staffs and 70 ropes (they cast a spell upon the people's eyes, and overawed them) scared them, (and produced a mighty spell) it is also said that this means: a clear lie."
وَأَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَىٰ مُوسَىٰ أَنْ أَلْقِ عَصَاكَ فَإِذَا هِيَ تَلْقَفُ مَا يَأْفِكُونَ,(And We inspired Moses (saying): Throw thy staff!) and he threw it. (And lo! it swallowed up their lying show) their staffs and ropes.
فَوَقَعَ ٱلْحَقُّ وَبَطَلَ مَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ,(Thus was the Truth vindicated) it became clear that Moses was right (and that which they were doing) of sorcery (was made vain) fizzled away.
فَغُلِبُواْ هُنَالِكَ وَٱنقَلَبُواْ صَاغِرِينَ,(Thus were they there defeated) upon which Moses was victorious against them (and brought low) and they were humiliated.
وَأُلْقِيَ ٱلسَّحَرَةُ سَاجِدِينَ,"(And the wizards fell down prostrate) to Allah; it is also said that they prostrated themselves so fast, that it seemed as if they had fallen prostrate,"
قَالُوۤاْ آمَنَّا بِرَبِّ ٱلْعَالَمِينَ,(Crying: We believe in the Lord of the Worlds) Pharaoh said: are you referring to me?
رَبِّ مُوسَىٰ وَهَارُونَ,They said: (The Lord of Moses and Aaron).

(Lo! this is the plot that ye have plotted in the city) between you and Moses (that ye may drive its people hence) by means of guile. (But ye shall come to know!)
لأُقَطِّعَنَّ أَيْدِيَكُمْ وَأَرْجُلَكُمْ مِّنْ خِلاَفٍ ثُمَّ لأُصَلِّبَنَّكُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ,(Surely I shall have your hands and feet cut off upon alternate sides) the right hand with the left leg. (Then I shall crucify you every one) on the river bank.
قَالُوۤاْ إِنَّآ إِلَىٰ رَبِّنَا مُنقَلِبُونَ,(They) i.e. the wizards (said: Lo! We are about to return unto our Lord!)
وَمَا تَنقِمُ مِنَّآ إِلاَّ أَنْ آمَنَّا بِآيَاتِ رَبِّنَا لَمَّا جَآءَتْنَا رَبَّنَآ أَفْرِغْ عَلَيْنَا صَبْراً وَتَوَفَّنَا مُسْلِمِينَ,"(Thou takest vengeance on us) you are censuring and punishing us (only forasmuch as we believed the tokens of our Lord when they came unto us.

وَقَالَ ٱلْمَلأُ مِن قَوْمِ فِرْعَونَ أَتَذَرُ مُوسَىٰ وَقَوْمَهُ لِيُفْسِدُواْ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَيَذَرَكَ وَآلِهَتَكَ قَالَ سَنُقَتِّلُ أَبْنَآءَهُمْ وَنَسْتَحْيِـي نِسَآءَهُمْ وَإِنَّا فَوْقَهُمْ قَاهِرُونَ,"(The chiefs of Pharaoh's people said: (O King), wilt thou) not kill them and (suffer Moses and his people to make mischief in the land) by changing the religion and worship, (and flout thee) and abandon you (and thy gods) and the worship of your gods; it is also said that this means, according to a different reading: and leave worshipping you as a god? (He) Pharaoh (said: We will slay their sons) their young sons, as we did the first time (and spare) and use (their women) their grown up women, (for lo! we are in power over them) we have dominance and supremacy over them."
قَالَ مُوسَىٰ لِقَوْمِهِ ٱسْتَعِينُوا بِٱللَّهِ وَٱصْبِرُوۤاْ إِنَّ ٱلأَرْضَ لِلَّهِ يُورِثُهَا مَن يَشَآءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ وَٱلْعَاقِبَةُ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ,"(And Moses said unto his people: Seek help in Allah and endure) the affliction. (Lo! the earth) the land of Egypt (is Allah's. He giveth it for an inheritance to whom He will. And lo! the sequel) Paradise (is for those who keep their duty (unto Him)) those who ward off disbelief, idolatry and indecencies."
قَالُوۤاْ أُوذِينَا مِن قَبْلِ أَن تَأْتِينَا وَمِن بَعْدِ مَا جِئْتَنَا قَالَ عَسَىٰ رَبُّكُمْ أَن يُهْلِكَ عَدُوَّكُمْ وَيَسْتَخْلِفَكُمْ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ فَيَنظُرَ كَيْفَ تَعْمَلُونَ,"(They said:) O Moses, (We suffered hurt) we were tormented by the killing of our sons, the use of our women and also by working (before thou camest unto us, and since thou hast come unto us) with the message. (He) Moses (said: it may be) the expression 'may be' ['asa] when used in relation to Allah denotes categoricalness (that your Lord is going to destroy your adversary) Pharaoh and by means of drought and hunger (and make you vicegerents in the earth) make you in the inhabitants of the land of Egypt, (that He may see how ye behave) with regard to obeying Him."
وَلَقَدْ أَخَذْنَآ آلَ فِرْعَونَ بِٱلسِّنِينَ وَنَقْصٍ مِّن ٱلثَّمَرَاتِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَذَّكَّرُونَ,"(And We straitened Pharaoh's folk with famine) and hunger, year after year (and the dearth of fruits) the disappearance of fruits, (that peradventure they might heed) that they might take admonition."
فَإِذَا جَآءَتْهُمُ ٱلْحَسَنَةُ قَالُواْ لَنَا هَـٰذِهِ وَإِن تُصِبْهُمْ سَيِّئَةٌ يَطَّيَّرُواْ بِمُوسَىٰ وَمَن مَّعَهُ أَلاۤ إِنَّمَا طَائِرُهُمْ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ وَلَـٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَهُمْ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ,"(But whenever good) land fertility, abundance and comfort (befell them, they said: This is ours) this is our right; (and whenever evil) drought, lack of fruits and hardship (smote them they ascribed it to the evil auspices of Moses and those with him). Allah said: (Surely their evil auspice) their hardship and abundance (was only with Allah. But most of them) all of them (knew not) this nor believed in it."
وَقَالُواْ مَهْمَا تَأْتِنَا بِهِ مِن آيَةٍ لِّتَسْحَرَنَا بِهَا فَمَا نَحْنُ لَكَ بِمُؤْمِنِينَ,"(And they said:) O Moses, whenever and (Whatever portent) sign (thou bringest wherewith to bewitch us) to dazzle our eyes with, (we shall not put faith in thee) we shall not believe in the message, and so Moses (pbuh) prayed against them."
فَأَرْسَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلطُّوفَانَ وَٱلْجَرَادَ وَٱلْقُمَّلَ وَٱلضَّفَادِعَ وَٱلدَّمَ آيَاتٍ مُّفَصَّلاَتٍ فَٱسْتَكْبَرُواْ وَكَانُواْ قَوْماً مُّجْرِمِينَ,"(So We sent them) Allah inflicted upon them (the flood) continuous, uninterrupted rain: day and night, from Saturday to Saturday (and the locusts) He sent on the locust which ate everything that the earth produced: vegetation and fruits (and the vermin) and He also inflicted them with the vermin-crawling creatures without wings-which devoured whatever the locusts left uneaten (and the frogs) and after this He set on them frogs so much so that they harmed them (and the blood) after which He inflicted on them blood such that their wells and rivers filled with blood (a succession of clear signs) of one month interval. (But they were arrogant) and refused to believe (and became guilty) idolaters."
وَلَمَّا وَقَعَ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلرِّجْزُ قَالُواْ يٰمُوسَىٰ ٱدْعُ لَنَا رَبَّكَ بِمَا عَهِدَ عِندَكَ لَئِن كَشَفْتَ عَنَّا ٱلرِّجْزَ لَنُؤْمِنَنَّ لَكَ وَلَنُرْسِلَنَّ مَعَكَ بَنِيۤ إِسْرَآئِيلَ,"(And when the terror fell on them) whenever a torment fell on them such as the flood, locusts, vermin, frogs and blood (they cried: O Moses! Pray for us unto your Lord) ask your Lord for us, (because He hath a covenant with thee) because of that with which He has commanded you. (If thou removest the terror from us) if you remove the punishment from us (we verily will trust thee) we will believe in you (and will let the Children of Israel go with thee) with all their property."

وَإِذ نَتَقْنَا ٱلْجَبَلَ فَوْقَهُمْ كَأَنَّهُ ظُلَّةٌ وَظَنُّوۤاْ أَنَّهُ وَاقِعٌ بِهِمْ خُذُواْ مَآ ءَاتَيْنَٰكُم بِقُوَّةٍ وَٱذْكُرُواْ مَا فِيهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ,"(And when We shook the Mount) when We extracted, raised and fixed the Mount (above them) above their heads (as it were a covering) for comfort, (and they supposed) they knew and were certain (that it was going to fall upon them) if they did not accept the Scripture ((and We said): Hold fast that which We have given you) act according to it seriously and diligently, (and remember that which is therein) of reward and punishment; it is also said that this means: recall what is therein of commands and prohibitions; and it is also said that this means: act upon that which is therein of the lawful and the unlawful, (that ye may ward off (evil)) that you may ward off Allah's wrath and torment and that you may believe in Allah."
وَإِذْ أَخَذَ رَبُّكَ مِن بَنِيۤ ءَادَمَ مِن ظُهُورِهِمْ ذُرِّيَّتَهُمْ وَأَشْهَدَهُمْ عَلَىٰ أَنفُسِهِمْ أَلَسْتُ بِرَبِّكُمْ قَالُواْ بَلَىٰ شَهِدْنَآ أَن تَقُولُواْ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ إِنَّا كُنَّا عَنْ هَـٰذَا غَافِلِينَ,"(And (remember) when thy Lord) O Muhammad (brought forth) on the Day of the Covenant (from the Children of Adam, from their reins, their seed) He brought forth the seeds from their reins, (and made them testify of themselves, (saying): Am I not your Lord? They said: Yea, verily We testify) we know and acknowledge that You are our Lord. Allah then said to the angels: be witnesses over them; and let you be witnesses over one another. ((That was) lest ye should say) so that you do not say (at the Day of Resurrection: Lo! of this) covenant (we were unaware) we were not made to make pledge;"
أَوْ تَقُولُوۤاْ إِنَّمَآ أَشْرَكَ آبَاؤُنَا مِن قَبْلُ وَكُنَّا ذُرِّيَّةً مِّن بَعْدِهِمْ أَفَتُهْلِكُنَا بِمَا فَعَلَ ٱلْمُبْطِلُونَ,"(Or lest ye should say) and so that you do not say: ((It is) only (that) our fathers ascribed partners to Allah of old) before us, and it is them who broke the covenant and pledge before us (and we were (their) seed) small and weak (after them) and we just emulated them. (Wilt Thou destroy us) will you punish us (on account of that which those who follow falsehood did?) on account of what the idolaters did before us in terms of breaking the covenant?"
وَكَذٰلِكَ نُفَصِّلُ ٱلآيَاتِ وَلَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ,"(Thus We detail Our revelations) We explain in the Qur'an the story of the Covenant, (that haply they may return) from disbelief and idolatry to the initial Covenant."
وَٱتْلُ عَلَيْهِمْ نَبَأَ ٱلَّذِي ۤ ءَاتَيْنَاهُ ءَايَاتِنَا فَٱنْسَلَخَ مِنْهَا فَأَتْبَعَهُ ٱلشَّيْطَانُ فَكَانَ مِنَ ٱلْغَاوِينَ,"(Recite unto them) O Muhammad (the tale of him to whom We gave Our revelations) the greatest divine name, (but he sloughed them off) the reference here is to Bal'am Ibn Ba'ura' whom Allah honoured with His greatest name but he used to pray against Moses and so Allah took it away from him. It is also said that the reference here is to Umayyah Ibn al-Salt whom Allah honoured with knowledge and good speech but when he did not believe, Allah took this away from him, (so Satan overtook him) Satan deluded him (and he became of those who lead astray) he became of the erring disbelievers."
وَلَوْ شِئْنَا لَرَفَعْنَاهُ بِهَا وَلَـٰكِنَّهُ أَخْلَدَ إِلَى ٱلأَرْضِ وَٱتَّبَعَ هَوَاهُ فَمَثَلُهُ كَمَثَلِ ٱلْكَلْبِ إِن تَحْمِلْ عَلَيْهِ يَلْهَثْ أَوْ تَتْرُكْهُ يَلْهَث ذَّلِكَ مَثَلُ ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلَّذِينَ كَذَّبُواْ بِآيَاتِنَا فَٱقْصُصِ ٱلْقَصَصَ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَفَكَّرُونَ,"(And had We willed We could have raised him by their means) We could have raised him by means of the greatest name to heaven and made him sovereign over the people of this world, (but he clung to the earth) he inclined to the wealth of this world (and followed his own lust) the lust of leadership; it is also said that this means: the lust of his ego by engaging in evil things. (Therefore his likeness) the likeness of Bal'am; and it is said: the likeness of Umayyah Ibn al-Salt (is as the likeness of a dog; if thou attackest him) and drive him away from you (he panteth with his tongue out, and if thou leavest him) and do not drive him away (he panteth with his tongue out) such is the case with Bal'am and Umayyah, when they were admonished they did not take any heed and when they were left alone, they did not understand anything. (Such is the likeness of the people who deny Our revelations) Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an. These people are the Jews. (Narrate unto them the history (of the men of old)) recite to them the Qur'an, (that haply they may take thought) that haply they may reflect on the similes of the Qur'an."
سَآءَ مَثَلاً ٱلْقَوْمُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَذَّبُواْ بِآيَاتِنَا وَأَنفُسَهُمْ كَانُواْ يَظْلِمُونَ,"(Evil as an example are the folk who denied Our revelations) Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an, if their example is as that of a dog, (and were wont to wrong themselves) to harm themselves by being tortured."

(These are as the cattle) in relation to understanding the Truth (nay, but they are worse!) because they are disbelievers (These are the neglectful) those who are oblivious to the matter of the Hereafter, deniers of it."
وَللَّهِ ٱلأَسْمَآءُ ٱلْحُسْنَىٰ فَٱدْعُوهُ بِهَا وَذَرُواْ ٱلَّذِينَ يُلْحِدُونَ فِيۤ أَسْمَآئِهِ سَيُجْزَوْنَ مَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ,"(Allah's are the fairest names) the loftiest attributes: knowledge, power, hearing, sight, and the like. (Invoke Him by them) recite by them. (And leave the company of those who blaspheme His names) those who deny His names and attributes; and according to a different reading this means: those who are disinclined to acknowledge His names; and it is also said that this means: those who liken His names to al-Lat, al-'Uzza, and Manat. (They will be requited) in the Hereafter for (what they do) and say in the life of this world."
وَمِمَّنْ خَلَقْنَآ أُمَّةٌ يَهْدُونَ بِٱلْحَقِّ وَبِهِ يَعْدِلُونَ,(And of those whom We created there is a nation) a group (who guide with the Truth) bid to the Truth (and establish justice therewith) and act upon the Truth. This group is the Community of Muhammad (pbuh).
وَٱلَّذِينَ كَذَّبُواْ بِآيَٰتِنَا سَنَسْتَدْرِجُهُمْ مِّنْ حَيْثُ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ,"(And those who deny Our revelations) Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an. These are Abu Jahl and his followers as well as all those who make a mockery of any punishment inflicted on them (step by step We lead them on) We will punish them (from whence they know not) that the punishment is being sent to them. And indeed Allah destroyed them in one day, each of which with a different type of destruction."
وَأُمْلِي لَهُمْ إِنَّ كَيْدِي مَتِينٌ,(I give them rein) I give them respite ((for) lo! My scheme is strong) My punishment and seizure is mighty.

Then Allah, Exalted is He, said: ((that) there is no madness) there is no touch of madness whatsoever (in their comrade) in their Prophet? (He is but a plain warner) and Messenger who explains to them in a language they understand."
أَوَلَمْ يَنْظُرُواْ فِي مَلَكُوتِ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَمَا خَلَقَ ٱللَّهُ مِن شَيْءٍ وَأَنْ عَسَىۤ أَن يَكُونَ قَدِ ٱقْتَرَبَ أَجَلُهُمْ فَبِأَيِّ حَدِيثٍ بَعْدَهُ يُؤْمِنُونَ,"(Have they not considered) i.e. the people of Mecca (the dominion of the heavens) the sun, moon, stars and clouds (and the earth) and the dominion of the earth: the trees, mountains, oceans and beasts, (and what things Allah hath created) and all the things that Allah created, (and that it may be) 'may be' ['asa] when used in relation to Allah denotes a requisite (that their own term draweth nigh) their destruction draws near? (In what fact after this) in what Scripture after Allah's Scripture (will they believe) if they do not believe in this Scripture?"

Say: Knowledge thereof) the knowledge of its timing and occurrence (is with my Lord only) is from my Lord. (He alone will manifest it at its proper time) none but He manifests its occurrence and timing. (It is heavy in the heavens and the earth) the knowledge of its occurrence and timing is heavy on the dwellers of the heavens and earth. (It cometh not to you save unawares) except all of a sudden. (They question thee) O Muhammad about the Hour (as if thou couldst be well informed thereof) as if you have knowledge of its timing; it is also said that this means: as if you are ignorant of it; as it is said that this means: as if you are oblivious to it. (Say) O Muhammad: (Knowledge thereof) knowledge of its occurrence and timing (is with Allah only) from Allah only, (but most of mankind) the people of Mecca (know not) nor believe in it."

(Had I knowledge of the Unseen) benefit and harm, (I should have abundance of wealth) of benefit, (and adversity) harm (would not touch me) it is also said that this means: if I knew when punishment would descend upon you, I would do good in abundance out of gratitude and no grief or sadness for you would touch me because of it; it is also said that this means: If I knew when I was to die, I would do good and perform righteous works in abundance and hardship would not touch me; it is also said that this means: If I knew the timing of droughts, lack of harvest and of rises in prices, I would amass good in abundance and hardship would not touch me. (I am but a warner) of the Fire, (and a bearer of good tidings) of Paradise (unto folk who believe) in Paradise and hell."

(And when he covered her) and when he made love to her (she bore a light burden, and she passed (unnoticed) with it) she stood up and sat down because of pain, (but when it became heavy) when the child became heavy in her womb, they thought, because of Satan's whispering, that it was a beast (they cried unto Allah, their Lord, saying: If thou givest unto us aright) if you give us a sound human being (we shall be of the thankful) for it."
فَلَمَّآ آتَاهُمَا صَالِحاً جَعَلاَ لَهُ شُرَكَآءَ فِيمَآ آتَاهُمَا فَتَعَالَى ٱللَّهُ عَمَّا يُشْرِكُونَ,"(But when He gave unto them aright) a sound human being, (they ascribed unto Him partners) they made Iblis a partner (about that which He had given them) in naming that which he had given them of offspring: they called him 'Abdullah and 'Abd al-Harth.

This fifth used to be divided at the time of the Prophet (pbuh) into five shares: one share for the Prophet (pbuh) which was the share given for the sake of Allah (Allah's share); a share for the Prophet's kinsmen, because the Prophet (pbuh) used to give to his kinsmen on behalf of Allah; a share for the orphans; a share for the needy; and a share for the wayfarer. When the Prophet (pbuh) died, the share of the Prophet (pbuh) and that of his kinsmen were cancelled due to the saying of Abu Bakr: “I heard Allah's Messenger (pbuh) say: each prophet has, while still alive, an assigned means of subsistence, and when he dies, it is cancelled and belongs to no one”. Abu Bakr, 'Umar, 'Uthman and 'Ali in their respective reigns divided the fifth into three shares: a share for the orphans, other than the orphans of Banu 'Abd al-Muttalib, a share for the needy, other than the needy of 'Abd al-Muttalib, and a share for the wayfarers who are weak and in need of help; (if ye believe in Allah and that which We revealed unto Our slave) Muhammad (pbuh) (on the Day of Discrimination) and the day of the alternation of power and victory of Muhammad (pbuh); it is also said that the Day of Discrimination means the day when Allah discriminated between truth and falsehood, i.e. the Day of Badr, when Allah decreed victory and the spoils of war for the Prophet (pbuh) and his Companions, while inflicting death and defeat upon Abu Jahl and his host, (the day when the two armies) the army of Muhammad (pbuh) and that of Abu Sufyan (met.

All these treaties were broken except for the treaty with the Banu Kinanah which was for nine months. Whoever had a treaty for more or less than four months, their treaties were ratified to last four month beginning from the day of immolation; and whoever had a treaty of four months, that treaty was ratified to last four months beginning from the day of immolation. Those who had a treaty of nine months, their treaties were left as they were, while those who did not sign any treaty, were granted one of 50 days beginning from the day of immolation until the departure of the person who was in a state of ritual consecration:"
فَسِيحُواْ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ أَرْبَعَةَ أَشْهُرٍ وَٱعْلَمُوۤاْ أَنَّكُمْ غَيْرُ مُعْجِزِي ٱللَّهِ وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ مُخْزِي ٱلْكَافِرِينَ,"Allah said to them (Travel freely in the land) move about in the land beginning from the day of immolation for (four months) safe from being killed because of the treaty, (and know) O disbelievers (that ye cannot escape Allah) that you cannot escape Allah's punishment, by being killed, after the lapse of a the four months (and that Allah will confound the disbelievers) He will punish the disbelievers after four months by subjecting them to death."
وَأَذَانٌ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ إِلَى ٱلنَّاسِ يَوْمَ ٱلْحَجِّ ٱلأَكْبَرِ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ بَرِيۤءٌ مِّنَ ٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ وَرَسُولُهُ فَإِن تُبْتُمْ فَهُوَ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ وَإِن تَوَلَّيْتُمْ فَٱعْلَمُوۤاْ أَنَّكُمْ غَيْرُ مُعْجِزِي ٱللَّهِ وَبَشِّرِ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ بِعَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ,"(And a proclamation from Allah) and this is a declaration from Allah (and His messenger to all men on the day of the Greater Pilgrimage) on the day of immolation (that Allah is free from obligation to the idolaters) their religion, and the treaties they broke, (and (so is) His messenger) he is also free from obligation to them. (So, if ye repent) from idolatry and believe in Allah and Muhammad (pbuh) as well as in the Qur'an, (it will be better for you) than idolatry; (but if ye are averse) to faith and repentance, (then know) O idolaters (that ye cannot escape Allah) you cannot escape His punishment. (Give tidings (O Muhammad) of a painful doom to those who disbelieve) i.e. that they will be killed after the elapse of four months."

(As for these), fulfil their treaty to them till their term) i.e. nine months. (Lo! Allah loveth those who keep their duty (unto Him)) by not breaking their treaties."
فَإِذَا ٱنسَلَخَ ٱلأَشْهُرُ ٱلْحُرُمُ فَٱقْتُلُواْ ٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ حَيْثُ وَجَدتُّمُوهُمْ وَخُذُوهُمْ وَٱحْصُرُوهُمْ وَٱقْعُدُواْ لَهُمْ كُلَّ مَرْصَدٍ فَإِن تَابُواْ وَأَقَامُواْ ٱلصَّلَٰوةَ وَءَاتَوُاْ ٱلزَّكَٰوةَ فَخَلُّواْ سَبِيلَهُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"(Then, when the sacred months have passed) then after the day of immolation when the month of Muharram passes, (slay the idolaters) whose treaty is for fifty days (wherever ye find them) whether in the Sacred Precinct or outside it, during the sacred months or at any other time, (and take them (captive)) imprison them, (and besiege them) in their homes, (and prepare for them each ambush) on every road they tread for trade. (But if they repent) from idolatry and believe in Allah (and establish worship) and acknowledge the five daily prayers (and pay the poor-due) acknowledge the payment of the poor-due, (then leave their way free) if they wish to go to the House of Allah. (Lo! Allah is Forgiving) He forgives whoever repents, (Merciful) towards whosoever dies in a state of repentance."

(That) which I have mentioned (is because they are a folk who know not) Allah's command and His divine Oneness."

(So long as they are true to you) in that they honour their treaty, (be true to them) completely. (Lo! Allah loveth those who keep their duty) and abstain from breaking their treaties."

(They satisfy you with their mouths) with their tongues (the while their hearts refuse) while their hearts are averse to it. (And most of them) all of them (are wrong-doers) breakers of treaties."
ٱشْتَرَوْاْ بِآيَاتِ ٱللَّهِ ثَمَناً قَلِيلاً فَصَدُّواْ عَن سَبِيلِهِ إِنَّهُمْ سَآءَ مَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ,"(They have purchased with the revelations of Allah) i.e. Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an (a little gain) a small profit, (so they debar (men) from His way) from His religion and obedience. (Lo! evil is that which they are wont to do) evil is that which they used to do of concealment and other things. It is also said that this verse was revealed about the Jews."

He boasted to 'Ali or to another believer who took part in the battle of Badr, saying: “we give water to the pilgrims and tend to the Sacred House, and do this and that, etc.”, so Allah, Exalted is He, said: (Count ye the slaking of a pilgrim's thirst) did you say that giving water to the pilgrim (and tendance of the Inviolable Place of Worship as (equal to the worth of him) who believeth in Allah) is like the faith of he who believes in Allah, i.e. the believer who took part in the battle of Badr (and the Last Day) and believes in resurrection after death, (and striveth in the way of Allah) and strives in obedience of Allah on the Day of Badr? (They are not equal in the sight of Allah) as far as obedience and reward are concerned. (Allah guideth not) leads not to His religion (wrong-doing folk) the idolaters, those who do not deserve it."

(They who hoard up) amass (gold and silver and spend it not) the gold and silver (in the way of Allah) in obedience of Allah; it is also said that this means: who do not pay the poor-due from it, (unto them give tidings) O Muhammad (of a painful doom)."

Four of them) four of these months (are sacred): Rajab, Dhu'l-Qa'dah, Dhu'l-Hijjah and Muharram: (that is the right religion) that is the right calculation: it neither increases or decreases. (So wrong not) harm not (yourselves) through transgression (in them) in those months; it is also said: in the sacred months.

And so when they used to do this, Muharram would not be considered sacred while Safar became sacred instead, (that they may make up) that they may match (the number of the months which Allah hath hallowed) four in number, (so that they allow that which Allah hath forbidden) i.e. Muharram. (The evil of their deeds is made fair-seeming unto them. Allah guideth not) leads not to His religion (the disbelieving folk) those who do not deserve it. The one who used to postpone the sacred months was a man called Nu'aym Ibn Tha'labah."

(Say) to them, O Muhammad: (A hearer of good) and not evil (for you) i.e. he listens to you and believes what is good rather than believes that you are lying; it is also said that this means: if he is a hearer, then it is good for you, (who believeth in Allah) he believes in the word of Allah (and is true to the believers) and he believes the word of sincere believers, (and a mercy) preventing from torment (for such of you as believe) both inwardly and outwardly.

When 'Amir Ibn Qays informed the Prophet (pbuh) Jallas swore by Allah that he did not say this. But Allah gave him the lie and said (yet they did say the word of disbelief, and did disbelieve after their Surrender (to Allah).

This refers to Abu 'Uqayl 'Abd al-Rahman Ibn Tijan who could not find anything to give for alms except a measure of dates, (and deride them) because of the little alms he gave. The hypocrites said about him: he did not bring this except that he wished to be mentioned and be given more alms than he gave himself, (Allah (Himself) derideth them) on the day of Judgement.

وَإِذَا مَآ أُنزِلَتْ سُورَةٌ نَّظَرَ بَعْضُهُمْ إِلَىٰ بَعْضٍ هَلْ يَرَاكُمْ مِّنْ أَحَدٍ ثُمَّ ٱنصَرَفُواْ صَرَفَ ٱللَّهُ قُلُوبَهُم بِأَنَّهُمْ قَوْمٌ لاَّ يَفْقَهُونَ,"(And whenever a surah is revealed) whenever Gabriel brings down a surah exposing the fault of the hypocrites and the Prophet (pbuh) used to recite to them, (they) the hypocrites (look one at another (as who should say): Doth anybody) among the sincere believers (see you? Then they turn away) from the prayer, the sermon, the Truth and guidance. (Allah turns away their hearts) from the Truth and guidance; it is also said: they swerved from the Truth and guidance, and so Allah swerved their hearts from the Truth and guidance (because they are a folk who understand not) nor believe in the command of Allah."

(There is no intercessor (with Him)) no close angel and no sent prophet will intercede for anyone (save after His permission) save after Allah's leave. (That is Allah, your Lord) it is your Lord Who does thus, (so worship Him) profess His divine Oneness. (Oh, will ye not remind?) will you not take heed?"

(Allah created not (all) that save in truth) in order to expound the Truth and the error. (He detaileth the revelations) He details the verses of the Qur'an with signs of divine Oneness (for people who have knowledge) for people who believe."

(Say) to them, O Muhammad: (It is not for me) it is not permissible for me (to change it of my own accord. I only follow that which is inspired in me) I do not say or do except that which is revealed to me in the Qur'an. (Lo! If I disobey my Lord) by changing the revelation (I fear) I know (the retribution of an awful Day) a severe Day."

(I dwelt among you a whole lifetime) 40 years (before it) before the revelation of the Qur'an, and before that I never said anything.

فَكَفَىٰ بِٱللَّهِ شَهِيداً بَيْنَنَا وَبَيْنَكُمْ إِن كُنَّا عَنْ عِبَادَتِكُمْ لَغَافِلِينَ,"The disbelievers answer back and say: “you have indeed commanded us to worship”, at which point the idols respond: (Allah sufficeth as a witness between us and you, that we were unaware of your worship) we were ignorant of your worship of us."
هُنَالِكَ تَبْلُواْ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ مَّآ أَسْلَفَتْ وَرُدُّوۤاْ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ مَوْلاَهُمُ ٱلْحَقِّ وَضَلَّ عَنْهُمْ مَّا كَانُواْ يَفْتَرُونَ,"(There) at this juncture (doth every soul experience) know; and according to another variant: read (that which it did aforetime) of good or evil, (and they are returned unto Allah, their rightful Lord) their true God, (and that which they used to invent) to wrongfully worship (hath failed them) being too preoccupied to pay any attention to them."
قُلْ مَن يَرْزُقُكُم مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ وَٱلأَرْضِ أَمَّن يَمْلِكُ ٱلسَّمْعَ وٱلأَبْصَارَ وَمَن يُخْرِجُ ٱلْحَيَّ مِنَ ٱلْمَيِّتِ وَيُخْرِجُ ٱلْمَيِّتَ مِنَ ٱلْحَيِّ وَمَن يُدَبِّرُ ٱلأَمْرَ فَسَيَقُولُونَ ٱللَّهُ فَقُلْ أَفَلاَ تَتَّقُونَ,"(Say) to the disbelievers of Mecca, O Muhammad: (Who provideth for you from the sky) through rain (and the earth) by means of vegetation and fruit, (or Who owneth hearing and sight) He says: who is able to create hearing and sight; (and Who bringeth forth the living from the dead) who is able to bring forth the living from the dead, i.e. living creatures and beasts from sperm drops; it is also said that this means: who can bring a bird from an egg or a spike from a grain (and bringeth forth the dead from the living) sperm drops from living creatures and beasts; it is also said that this means: an egg from a bird or a grain from a spike; (and Who directeth the course) and who can direct and look into the affairs of His servants and sends the angels with revelation, Scriptures and misfortunes? (They will say: Allah. Then say) O Muhammad: (Will ye not then keep your duty (unto Him)) will you not then obey Allah?"
فَذَلِكُمُ ٱللَّهُ رَبُّكُمُ ٱلْحَقُّ فَمَاذَا بَعْدَ ٱلْحَقِّ إِلاَّ ٱلضَّلاَلُ فَأَنَّىٰ تُصْرَفُونَ,"(Such then is Allah, your rightful Lord) the one who is able to do so is your Lord, Who is the Truth and whose worship is the Truth. (After the Truth what is there saving error) after worship of Allah what is your worship if not worship of the devil? (How then are ye turned away) from whence do you invent lies about Allah!"
كَذَلِكَ حَقَّتْ كَلِمَتُ رَبِّكَ عَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ فَسَقُوۤاْ أَنَّهُمْ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ,(Thus is the Word of your Lord) to impose His chastisement (justified) enjoined (concerning those who do wrong) concerning the disbelievers: (that they believe not) as it is in Allah's foreknowledge.
قُلْ هَلْ مِن شُرَكَآئِكُمْ مَّن يَبْدَؤُاْ ٱلْخَلْقَ ثُمَّ يُعِيدُهُ قُلِ ٱللَّهُ يَبْدَؤُاْ ٱلْخَلْقَ ثُمَّ يُعِيدُهُ فَأَنَّىٰ تُؤْفَكُونَ,"(Say) to them, O Muhammad: (Is there of your partners) your idols ((whom ye ascribe unto Allah) one that produceth Creation) from a sperm drop and imbues it with the spirit (and then reproduceth it) after death, on the Day of Judgement? If they answer you, fine, if not (Say: Allah produceth creation) from a sperm drop, (then reproduceth it) then brings back to life on the Day of Judgement. (How then, are ye misled) from whence do you invent lies; it is also said that this means: See, O Muhammad, how they are misled by lies!"
قُلْ هَلْ مِن شُرَكَآئِكُمْ مَّن يَهْدِيۤ إِلَى ٱلْحَقِّ قُلِ ٱللَّهُ يَهْدِي لِلْحَقِّ أَفَمَن يَهْدِيۤ إِلَى ٱلْحَقِّ أَحَقُّ أَن يُتَّبَعَ أَمَّن لاَّ يَهِدِّيۤ إِلاَّ أَن يُهْدَىٰ فَمَا لَكُمْ كَيْفَ تَحْكُمُونَ,"(Say) to them, O Muhammad: (Is there of your partners) is there of your idols ((whom ye ascribe unto Allah) one that leadeth to the Truth) and guidance? If they answer, fine, if not, (Say: Allah leadeth to the Truth) and guidance. (Is He Who leadeth to the Truth) and guidance (more deserving that He should be followed) worshipped and obeyed, (or he who findeth not the way) he who does not guide to the Truth or guidance (unless he (himself) be guided) carried and taken wherever one wants. (What aileth you? How judge ye) evil is that which you judge for yourselves?"
وَمَا يَتَّبِعُ أَكْثَرُهُمْ إِلاَّ ظَنّاً إِنَّ ٱلظَّنَّ لاَ يُغْنِي مِنَ ٱلْحَقِّ شَيْئاً إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلَيمٌ بِمَا يَفْعَلُونَ,"(Most of them follow) worship (naught but conjecture) i.e. except through conjecture. (Assuredly conjecture) their worship through conjecture (can by no means take the place of truth) can by no means dispense them from Allah's chastisement. (Lo! Allah is Aware of what they do) in their state of idolatry, in terms of worshipping idols, and other things."
وَمَا كَانَ هَـٰذَا ٱلْقُرْآنُ أَن يُفْتَرَىٰ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ وَلَـٰكِن تَصْدِيقَ ٱلَّذِي بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ وَتَفْصِيلَ ٱلْكِتَابِ لاَ رَيْبَ فِيهِ مِن رَّبِّ ٱلْعَالَمِينَ,"(And this Qur'an) which is recited to you by Muhammad (pbuh) (is not such as could ever be invented in despite of Allah; but it is a confirmation of that which was before it) it is a confirmation of the Torah, the Gospel, the Psalms and all other Scriptures in that they all call to the profession of divine Oneness and contain the traits and description of Muhammad (pbuh) (and an exposition of that which is decreed for mankind) the Qur'an exposits the lawful and the prohibited, the commands and prohibitions. (Therein is no doubt from the Lord of the Worlds) from the Master of all worlds."
أَمْ يَقُولُونَ ٱفْتَرَاهُ قُلْ فَأْتُواْ بِسُورَةٍ مِّثْلِهِ وَٱدْعُواْ مَنِ ٱسْتَطَعْتُمْ مِّن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ إِن كُنتُمْ صَادِقِينَ,"(Or say they) rather, the disbelievers of Mecca say: (He hath invented it) Muhammad (pbuh) invented the Qur'an himself? (Say) to them, O Muhammad: (Then bring a surah like unto it) like the surahs of the Qur'an, (and call (for help) on all ye can) seek help for this purpose from those idols you worship (besides Allah, if ye are truthful) that Muhammad (pbuh) has invented the Qur'an."
بَلْ كَذَّبُواْ بِمَا لَمْ يُحِيطُواْ بِعِلْمِهِ وَلَمَّا يَأْتِهِمْ تَأْوِيلُهُ كَذَلِكَ كَذَّبَ ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ فَٱنْظُرْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَاقِبَةُ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ,"(Nay, but they denied that, the knowledge whereof they could not compass) they denied that which their knowledge could not embrace, (and whereof the interpretation) the consequence of what the Qur'an promised them (hath not yet come unto them. Even so) just as your people deny the Scriptures and messengers (did those before them deny) the Scriptures and messengers. (Then see) O Muhammad (what was the consequence for the wrong-doers!) what was the end result of the idolaters who denied the Scriptures and messengers and never worshipped Allah. It is also said that this was a consolation from Allah, glorified and Mighty is He, to His Prophet (pbuh) so that he endures their harm."
وَمِنهُمْ مَّن يُؤْمِنُ بِهِ وَمِنْهُمْ مَّن لاَّ يُؤْمِنُ بِهِ وَرَبُّكَ أَعْلَمُ بِٱلْمُفْسِدِينَ,"(And of them) of the Jews (is he who believeth therein) he who believes in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an, i.e. before his death, (and of them) of the Jews (is he who believeth not therein) does not believe in Muhammad (pbuh) or in the Qur'an and dies in a state of disbelief, (and your Lord is best aware of the corrupters) of the Jews, and of those who believe and those who do not believe; it is also said that this verse was revealed about the idolaters."
وَإِن كَذَّبُوكَ فَقُل لِّي عَمَلِي وَلَكُمْ عَمَلُكُمْ أَنتُمْ بَرِيۤئُونَ مِمَّآ أَعْمَلُ وَأَنَاْ بَرِيۤءٌ مِّمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ,"(And if they deny thee) and if your people deny, O Muhammad, what you say, (say: Unto me my work) my religion, (and unto you your work) your religion. (You are innocent of what I do) and follow as religion, (and I am innocent of what ye do) and follow as religion."
وَمِنْهُمْ مَّن يَسْتَمِعُونَ إِلَيْكَ أَفَأَنتَ تُسْمِعُ ٱلصُّمَّ وَلَوْ كَانُواْ لاَ يَعْقِلُونَ,(And of them) of the Jews (are some who listen unto thee) listen to your words and speech; it is also said that this means: of the Arab idolaters who listen to your words and speech. (But canst thou) O Muhammad (make the deaf to hear even though they apprehend not) even though they have no desire to apprehend?
وَمِنهُمْ مَّن يَنظُرُ إِلَيْكَ أَفَأَنْتَ تَهْدِي ٱلْعُمْيَ وَلَوْ كَانُواْ لاَ يُبْصِرُونَ,(And of them) of the Jews; and it is said: of the idolaters (is he who looketh towards you. But canst thou guide) lead to guidance (the blind even though they see not) even though they do not desire to see the Truth and guidance?
إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لاَ يَظْلِمُ ٱلنَّاسَ شَيْئاً وَلَـٰكِنَّ ٱلنَّاسَ أَنفُسَهُمْ يَظْلِمُونَ,"(Lo! Allah wrongeth not mankind in aught) He neither decreases their good works nor increases their evil deeds; (but mankind wrong themselves) through disbelief, idolatry and transgressions."
وَيَوْمَ يَحْشُرُهُمْ كَأَن لَّمْ يَلْبَثُوۤاْ إِلاَّ سَاعَةً مِّنَ ٱلنَّهَارِ يَتَعَارَفُونَ بَيْنَهُمْ قَدْ خَسِرَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَذَّبُواْ بِلِقَآءِ ٱللَّهِ وَمَا كَانُواْ مُهْتَدِينَ,"(And on the day when He shall gather them) i.e. the Jews, the Christians and the idolaters (together, (when it will seem) as though they had tarried) in their graves (but an hour of the day, recognizing one another) recognising one another in some places and not recognising one another in others, (those will verily have perished) have lost (who denied the meeting with Allah) who denied resurrection after death, because they have lost both this world and the Next (and were not guided) from disbelief and error."
وَإِمَّا نُرِيَنَّكَ بَعْضَ ٱلَّذِي نَعِدُهُمْ أَوْ نَتَوَفَّيَنَّكَ فَإِلَيْنَا مَرْجِعُهُمْ ثُمَّ ٱللَّهُ شَهِيدٌ عَلَىٰ مَا يَفْعَلُونَ,"(Whether We let thee) O Muhammad (behold something of that which We promise them) of chastisement (or (whether We) cause thee to die) before We show you, O Muhammad, that which We promise them of chastisement, (still unto Us is their return) after they die, (and Allah, moreover, is Witness over what they do) of good and evil."
وَلِكُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولٌ فَإِذَا جَآءَ رَسُولُهُمْ قُضِيَ بَيْنَهُمْ بِٱلْقِسْطِ وَهُمْ لاَ يُظْلَمُونَ,"(And for every nation) for the adherents of each religion (there is a messenger) who calls them to Allah and to His religion. (And when their messenger cometh) to them and they deny (it will be judged between them) and the Messenger (fairly) with justice: those people will perish and the Messenger will be saved, (and they will not be wronged) their good works will not be decreased nor will their evil deeds be increased."
وَيَقُولُونَ مَتَىٰ هَـٰذَا ٱلْوَعْدُ إِن كُنتُمْ صَادِقِينَ,"(And they say) and the adherents of each religion say to their messenger: (When will this promise) that you have promised us (be fulfilled, if ye are truthful?)"
قُل لاَّ أَمْلِكُ لِنَفْسِي ضَرّاً وَلاَ نَفْعاً إِلاَّ مَا شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ لِكُلِّ أُمَّةٍ أَجَلٌ إِذَا جَآءَ أَجَلُهُمْ فَلاَ يَسْتَأْخِرُونَ سَاعَةً وَلاَ يَسْتَقْدِمُونَ,"(Say) to them, O Muhammad: (I have no power to) avoid (hurt or) bring (benefit) to (myself, save that which Allah willeth) of hurt or benefit. (For every nation there is an appointed time) a respite and determined time. (When their time cometh) when the time of their destruction comes, (then they cannot put it off an hour) after the appointed time, (nor hasten (it)) before the appointed time."
قُلْ أَرَأَيْتُمْ إِنْ أَتَاكُمْ عَذَابُهُ بَيَاتاً أَوْ نَهَاراً مَّاذَا يَسْتَعْجِلُ مِنْهُ ٱلْمُجْرِمُونَ,"(Say) O Muhammad, to the people of Mecca: (Have ye thought: When His doom) Allah's chastisement (cometh unto you as a raid by night, or in the (busy) day) what you will do? (what is there of it) of Allah's chastisement (that the guilty ones) the idolaters (desire to hasten?) and then say: we believe."
أَثُمَّ إِذَا مَا وَقَعَ آمَنْتُمْ بِهِ الآنَ وَقَدْ كُنتُم بِهِ تَسْتَعْجِلُونَ,"Say to them, O Muhammad: (Is it (only) then, when it hath befallen you) when the punishment has befallen you, (that you will believe?) They said: “Yes!” Say to them, O Muhammad, that it is said to them: (What! (Believe) now) in the punishment, (when (until now) ye have been hastening it) the punishment (on (through disbelief)) out of mockery?"
ثُمَّ قِيلَ لِلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ ذُوقُواْ عَذَابَ ٱلْخُلْدِ هَلْ تُجْزَوْنَ إِلاَّ بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَكْسِبُونَ,(Then will it be said unto those who dealt unjustly) the idolaters: (Taste the torment of eternity. Are ye requited) in the Hereafter (aught save what ye used to earn) do and say in the life of this world?
وَيَسْتَنْبِئُونَكَ أَحَقٌّ هُوَ قُلْ إِي وَرَبِّيۤ إِنَّهُ لَحَقٌّ وَمَآ أَنتُمْ بِمُعْجِزِينَ,"(And they ask thee) O Muhammad (to inform them) i.e. about the punishment and the Qur'an ((saying): Is it true) i.e. the punishment and the Qur'an? (Say: Yea, by my Lord) say: yes, by my Lord, (verily it is true) the punishment will truly happen, (and ye cannot escape) Allah's punishment."
وَلَوْ أَنَّ لِكُلِّ نَفْسٍ ظَلَمَتْ مَا فِي ٱلأَرْضِ لاَفْتَدَتْ بِهِ وَأَسَرُّواْ ٱلنَّدَامَةَ لَمَّا رَأَوُاْ ٱلْعَذَابَ وَقُضِيَ بَيْنَهُمْ بِٱلْقِسْطِ وَهُمْ لاَ يُظْلَمُونَ,"(And if each soul that doeth wrong) that ascribes partners to Allah (had all that is in the earth it would seek to ransom itself therewith) it would ransom itself from Allah's punishment; (and they will feel remorse within them) the leaders will conceal their remorse from the lowly among people, (when they see the doom) when they see the chastisement. (But it hath been judged between them) and the lowly among people (fairly) with justice (and they are not wronged) none of their good works will be diminished and none of their evil deeds will be increased."

(There hath come unto you an exhortation) a warning (from your Lord) regarding that which you are now in, (a balm) an exposition (for that which is in the breasts) of blindness, (a guidance) from error (and a mercy) which brings relief from punishment (for believers)."
قُلْ بِفَضْلِ ٱللَّهِ وَبِرَحْمَتِهِ فَبِذَلِكَ فَلْيَفْرَحُواْ هُوَ خَيْرٌ مِّمَّا يَجْمَعُونَ,"(Say) O Muhammad, to your Companions: (In the bounty of Allah) in the Qur'an with which Allah has honoured you (and in His mercy) the religion of Islam, which Allah has given you success to follow: (therein) i.e. in the Qur'an and Islam (let them rejoice. It is better) i.e. the Qur'an and Islam (than what they hoard) is better than what the Jews and idolaters amass of wealth."
قُلْ أَرَأَيْتُمْ مَّآ أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمْ مِّن رِّزْقٍ فَجَعَلْتُمْ مِّنْهُ حَرَاماً وَحَلاَلاً قُلْ ءَآللَّهُ أَذِنَ لَكُمْ أَمْ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ تَفْتَرُونَ,"(Say) O Muhammad, to the people of Mecca: (Have ye considered what provision) what crops and cattle (Allah hath sent down for you) Allah has created for you, (how ye have made of it lawful) for men (and unlawful) for women: i.e. the benefit of al-Bahirah, al-Sa'ibah and al-Ham? (Say) to them, O Muhammad: (Hath Allah permitted you) has Allah commanded this, (or do ye invent a lie concerning Allah) indeed you are inventing lies?"
وَمَا ظَنُّ ٱلَّذِينَ يَفْتَرُونَ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ ٱلْكَذِبَ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَذُو فَضْلٍ عَلَى ٱلنَّاسِ وَلَـٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَهُمْ لاَ يَشْكُرُونَ,"(And what think those who invent a lie concerning Allah) He will do with them (upon the Day of Resurrection?

(And not an atom's weight) of the servants' works (in the earth or in the sky escapeth) is hidden from (your Lord, nor what is less) nor what is lighter (than that or greater than that) or heavier, (but it is (written) in a clear Book) but it is written in the Guarded Tablet."

وَٱتْلُ عَلَيْهِمْ نَبَأَ نُوحٍ إِذْ قَالَ لِقَوْمِهِ يٰقَوْمِ إِن كَانَ كَبُرَ عَلَيْكُمْ مَّقَامِي وَتَذْكِيرِي بِآيَاتِ ٱللَّهِ فَعَلَى ٱللَّهِ تَوَكَّلْتُ فَأَجْمِعُوۤاْ أَمْرَكُمْ وَشُرَكَآءَكُمْ ثُمَّ لاَ يَكُنْ أَمْرُكُمْ عَلَيْكُمْ غُمَّةً ثُمَّ ٱقْضُوۤاْ إِلَيَّ وَلاَ تُنظِرُونَ,"(Recite unto them the story of Noah) in the Qur'an, (when he told his people: O my people! If my sojourn (here)) if my extended stay with you (and my reminding you) and my warning of you (by Allah's revelations) from the punishment of Allah (are an offence unto you, in Allah have I put my trust) I rely in and consign my matter to Allah, (so decide upon your course of action) unite upon one decision and one matter, (you and your partners) and seek the help of your idols. (Let not your course of action be in doubt for you) do not make your decision and matter too vague for yourselves. (Then come forth against me, give me no respite) do not wait."
فَإِن تَوَلَّيْتُمْ فَمَا سَأَلْتُكُمْ مِّنْ أَجْرٍ إِنْ أَجْرِيَ إِلاَّ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ وَأُمِرْتُ أَنْ أَكُونَ مِنَ ٱلْمُسْلِمِينَ,"(But if ye are averse) from believing in that which I brought (I have asked of you) in exchange for believing (no wage) no payment. (My wage) my reward for calling you to believe (is the concern of Allah only, and I am commanded to be of those who surrender (unto Him)) and to follow His religion."
فَكَذَّبُوهُ فَنَجَّيْنَاهُ وَمَن مَّعَهُ فِي ٱلْفُلْكِ وَجَعَلْنَاهُمْ خَلاَئِفَ وَأَغْرَقْنَا ٱلَّذِينَ كَذَّبُواْ بِآيَاتِنَا فَٱنْظُرْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَاقِبَةُ ٱلْمُنْذَرِينَ,"(But they denied him) i.e. they denied that which Noah had brought them, (so We saved him) from drowning (and those) believers who were (with him in the ship, and made them vicegerents) and inhabitants of the earth, (while We drowned those who denied Our revelations) We drowned those who denied Our Scripture and Messenger Noah. (See then) O Muhammad (the nature of the consequence for those who had been warned) the end result of those who were warned by the messengers but did not believe."
ثُمَّ بَعَثْنَا مِن بَعْدِهِ رُسُلاً إِلَىٰ قَوْمِهِمْ فَجَآءُوهُمْ بِٱلْبَيِّنَٰتِ فَمَا كَانُواْ لِيُؤْمِنُواْ بِمَا كَذَّبُواْ بِهِ مِن قَبْلُ كَذَٰلِكَ نَطْبَعُ عَلَىٰ قُلوبِ ٱلْمُعْتَدِينَ,"(Then, after him) after the destruction of the folk of Noah, (We sent messengers unto their folk, and they brought them clear proofs) commands, prohibitions and signs. (But they were not ready to believe in that which they denied before) i.e. on the day of the covenant. (Thus print) seal (We on the hearts of the transgressors) who engage in the prohibited instead of the lawful."
ثُمَّ بَعَثْنَا مِن بَعْدِهِمْ مُّوسَىٰ وَهَـٰرُونَ إِلَىٰ فِرْعَوْنَ وَمَلإِيْهِ بِآيَـٰتِنَا فَٱسْتَكْبَرُواْ وَكَانُواْ قَوْماً مُّجْرِمِينَ,"(Then, after them) after these messengers, (We sent Moses and Aaron unto Pharaoh and his chiefs with Our revelations) with Our Scripture; it is also said that this means: with Our nine signs: the hand, the staff, the deluge, the locusts, lice, frogs, blood, drought and shortage of harvests; it is also said that the revelations here mean: obliteration, (but they were arrogant) deeming themselves above faith, the Scripture, the Messenger and the revelations (and were a guilty folk) and were idolaters."
فَلَمَّا جَآءَهُمُ ٱلْحَقُّ مِنْ عِندِنَا قَالُوۤاْ إِنَّ هَـٰذَا لَسِحْرٌ مُّبِينٌ,"(And when the Truth) the Scripture, the Messenger and the revelations (from Our presence came unto them, they said: This) what Moses has brought (is mere magic) is a manifest lie; and according to a different reading this means: Moses is a lying sorcerer."
قَالَ مُوسَىٰ أَتقُولُونَ لِلْحَقِّ لَمَّا جَآءَكُمْ أَسِحْرٌ هَـٰذَا وَلاَ يُفْلِحُ ٱلسَّاحِرُونَ,"(Moses said) to them: (Speak ye (so) of the Truth) the Scripture, Messenger and revelations (when it hath come unto you? Is this magic? Now magicians thrive not) they have neither escape nor safety from Allah's chastisement."
قَالُوۤاْ أَجِئْتَنَا لِتَلْفِتَنَا عَمَّا وَجَدْنَا عَلَيْهِ آبَاءَنَا وَتَكُونَ لَكُمَا ٱلْكِبْرِيَآءُ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَمَا نَحْنُ لَكُمَا بِمُؤْمِنِينَ,"(They said) to Moses: (Hast thou come unto us to pervert us from that (faith) in which we found our fathers) of idol worship, (and that you two may own the place of greatness) sovereignty and power (in the land) of Egypt? (We will not believe you two)."
وَقَالَ فِرْعَوْنُ ٱئْتُونِي بِكُلِّ سَاحِرٍ عَلِيمٍ,(And Pharaoh said: Bring every cunning) every skilful (wizard unto me).
فَلَمَّا جَآءَ ٱلسَّحَرَةُ قَالَ لَهُمْ مُّوسَىٰ أَلْقُواْ مَآ أَنتُمْ مُّلْقُونَ,"(And when the wizards came, Moses said unto them: Cast your cast) cast your staffs and ropes!"
فَلَمَّآ أَلْقَواْ قَالَ مُوسَىٰ مَا جِئْتُمْ بِهِ ٱلسِّحْرُ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ سَيُبْطِلُهُ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لاَ يُصْلِحُ عَمَلَ ٱلْمُفْسِدِينَ,"(And when they had cast) their staffs and ropes, (Moses said) to them: (That which ye have brought) that which you have cast (is magic. Lo! Allah will make it vain) Allah will make it void. (Lo! Allah upholdeth not) Allah is not pleased with (the work of mischief-makers) of sorcerers."
وَيُحِقُّ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْحَقَّ بِكَلِمَاتِهِ وَلَوْ كَرِهَ ٱلْمُجْرِمُونَ,"(And Allah will vindicate) Allah will manifest for His religion (the Truth by His words) vindication, (however much the guilty be averse) even though the idolaters dislike this."
فَمَآ آمَنَ لِمُوسَىٰ إِلاَّ ذُرِّيَّةٌ مِّن قَوْمِهِ عَلَىٰ خَوْفٍ مِّن فِرْعَوْنَ وَمَلَئِهِمْ أَن يَفْتِنَهُمْ وَإِنَّ فِرْعَوْنَ لَعَالٍ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَإِنَّهُ لَمِنَ ٱلْمُسْرِفِينَ,"(But none trusted) none believed (Moses, save some scions of his people) from the people of Pharaoh: their fathers were Copts and their mothers were Israelites, and so they believed in Moses, ((and they were) in fear of Pharaoh and their chiefs, that they would persecute them) kill them. (Lo! Pharaoh was verily a tyrant) a foe (in the land) to the religion of Moses, (and Lo! he verily was of the wanton) he was of the idolaters."
وَقَالَ مُوسَىٰ يٰقَوْمِ إِن كُنتُمْ آمَنتُمْ بِٱللَّهِ فَعَلَيْهِ تَوَكَّلُوۤاْ إِن كُنتُم مُّسْلِمِينَ,"(And Moses said: O my people! If you have believed in Allah then put trust in Him, if ye have indeed surrendered (unto Him)) because you have indeed surrendered to Allah!"
فَقَالُواْ عَلَىٰ ٱللَّهِ تَوَكَّلْنَا رَبَّنَا لاَ تَجْعَلْنَا فِتْنَةً لِّلْقَوْمِ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ,"(They said: In Allah we put trust. Our Lord! Oh, make us not a lure for the wrong-doing folk) for the idolaters, i.e. do not give them mastery over us lest they think themselves to be followers of the Truth and us followers of falsehood;"
وَنَجِّنَا بِرَحْمَتِكَ مِنَ ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلْكَافِرِينَ,"(And, of Thy mercy, save us from the folk that disbelieve) from Pharaoh and his folk."

(that they may lead men astray) that by means of it they may lead your servants astray (from Thy way) from Your religion and obedience. (Our Lord! Destroy their riches and harden their hearts so that they believe not) so that they will not believe (till they see the painful doom) their own drowning."

Do ye twain keep to the straight path) of faith, obedience of Allah and conveyance of the message, (and follow not the road) the religion (of those who have no knowledge) regarding Allah's divine Oneness and do not believe in Him. The reference here is to Pharaoh and his folk."
وَجَاوَزْنَا بِبَنِيۤ إِسْرَائِيلَ ٱلْبَحْرَ فَأَتْبَعَهُمْ فِرْعَوْنُ وَجُنُودُهُ بَغْياً وَعَدْواً حَتَّىٰ إِذَآ أَدْرَكَهُ ٱلْغَرَقُ قَالَ آمَنتُ أَنَّهُ لاۤ إِلِـٰهَ إِلاَّ ٱلَّذِي آمَنَتْ بِهِ بَنوۤاْ إِسْرَائِيلَ وَأَنَاْ مِنَ ٱلْمُسْلِمِينَ,"(And We brought the Children of Israel across the sea, and Pharaoh with his hosts pursued them in rebellion) with their words (and transgression) with the intention of killing them, (till, when the (fate of) drowning overtook him, he exclaimed: I believe that there is no God save Him in whom the Children of Israel) Moses and his companions (believe, and I am of those who surrender (unto Him)) following their religion."
آلآنَ وَقَدْ عَصَيْتَ قَبْلُ وَكُنتَ مِنَ ٱلْمُفْسِدِينَ,"The Archangel Gabriel said to him: (What! Now!) will you believe now upon drowning (When hitherto) before this drowning (thou hast rebelled) disbelieved in Allah (and been of the wrong-doers) in the land of Egypt, killing, associating partners with Allah and calling for the worship of other than Allah?"
فَٱلْيَوْمَ نُنَجِّيكَ بِبَدَنِكَ لِتَكُونَ لِمَنْ خَلْفَكَ آيَةً وَإِنَّ كَثِيراً مِّنَ ٱلنَّاسِ عَنْ آيَاتِنَا لَغَافِلُونَ,"(But this day We save thee in your body) We save your cadaver in its armour (that thou mayst be a portent) that you may be a lesson, such that they do not claim what you claimed and know that you are not a god (for those after thee) among the disbelievers. (Lo! most of mankind) i.e. the disbelievers (are heedless of) are deniers of (Our portents) Our Scripture and Messenger."

Lo! your Lord) O Muhammad (will judge between them) between the Jews and Christians (on the Day of Resurrection concerning that wherein they used to differ) regarding religion."

The Prophet (pbuh) did not ask nor was he ever in doubt about the Qur'an. Rather, Allah was addressing with these words the people of the Prophet. (Verily the Truth from thy Lord) i.e. Gabriel with the Qur'an from your Lord, containing the events of past nations (hath come unto thee) O Muhammad. (So be not thou of the waverers) be not of the doubters."

(When they believed We drew off) We diverted (from them the torment of disgrace) the severe punishment (in the life of the world and gave them comfort for a while) We left them without punishment until they died.

(He hath set uncleanness) He leaves denial (upon those) in the hearts of those (who have no sense) who do not apprehend Allah's divine Oneness. This verse was revealed about Abu Talib. The Prophet (pbuh) was so keen that he believes, but Allah did not want him to believe."
قُلِ ٱنظُرُواْ مَاذَا فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَمَا تُغْنِي ٱلآيَاتُ وَٱلنُّذُرُ عَن قَوْمٍ لاَّ يُؤْمِنُونَ,"(Say) to them, O Muhammad: (Behold what is in the heavens): the sun, the moon and the stars (and the earth) what is in the earth: the trees, beasts, mountains and oceans!

(Say) O Muhammad: (Expect then!) the descent of punishment and my own destruction! (I am with you among the expectant) of the descent of punishment and destruction upon you.
ثُمَّ نُنَجِّي رُسُلَنَا وَٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ كَذَلِكَ حَقّاً عَلَيْنَا نُنجِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,"(Then shall We save Our messengers and the believers) in these messengers after the destruction of their people, (in like manner (as of old)) thus.

(And I am not a warder) a trustee (over you). This was abrogated by the verse of fighting."

((This is) a Scripture) i.e. the Qur'an (the revelations whereof are perfected) expositing the lawful and the prohibited, the commands and prohibitions (and then exposited) and then elucidated. ((It cometh) from One Wise) Who has ruled that none should be worshiped but He, (Informed) of he who worships and him who worships not,"

(At the very moment when they cover themselves with their clothing) at the moment they cover their heads with their clothes, (Allah knoweth that which they keep hidden) among themselves as well as that which they conceal in their hearts (and that which they proclaim) of fighting and antipathy; it is also said that this refers to that which they proclaim of love and keeping company. (Lo! He is Aware of what is in the breasts (of men)) whether it is good or evil."
وَمَا مِن دَآبَّةٍ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ إِلاَّ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ رِزْقُهَا وَيَعْلَمُ مُسْتَقَرَّهَا وَمُسْتَوْدَعَهَا كُلٌّ فِي كِتَابٍ مُّبِينٍ,"(And there is not a beast in the earth but the sustenance thereof dependeth on Allah) Allah takes charge of its sustenance.

(Yet if thou (O Muhammad) sayst) to the people of Mecca: (Lo! ye will be raised again) you will be brought back to life again (after death! those who disbelieve) the disbelievers of Mecca (will surely say: This) which Muhammad (pbuh) is saying (is naught but mere magic) manifest lies which will never happen."

(such) those who believe in the Book of Moses (believe therein) believe in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an; the reference here is to 'Abdullah Ibn Salam and his followers, (and Whoso disbelieveth therein) whoever disbelieves in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an (of the clans) of all the disbelievers, (the Fire is his appointed place) the Fire is his destination. (So be not thou) O Muhammad (in doubt concerning it) concerning the end result of the disbelievers. (Lo! it is the Truth from thy Lord) the destination of whosoever disbelieves in the Qur'an is hell; it is also said that this means: do not be in doubt about the Qur'an, it is Gabriel who brought it down; (but most of mankind) the people of Mecca (believe not)."

(Are they equal in similitude?) He says: are the believer and disbeliever equal in obedience and reward (Will ye not then be admonished?) will you not be admonished by the similes of the Qur'an such that you believe?"

Come ride with us) be saved with us by means of “there is no god except Allah”, (and be not with the disbelievers) following their religion lest you drown."
قَالَ سَآوِيۤ إِلَىٰ جَبَلٍ يَعْصِمُنِي مِنَ ٱلْمَآءِ قَالَ لاَ عَاصِمَ ٱلْيَوْمَ مِنْ أَمْرِ ٱللَّهِ إِلاَّ مَن رَّحِمَ وَحَالَ بَيْنَهُمَا ٱلْمَوْجُ فَكَانَ مِنَ ٱلْمُغْرَقِينَ,"(He said: I shall betake me) I will go (to some mountain that will save me) prevent me (from the water) from drowning. (Said) Noah: (This day there is none that saveth) there is none that prevents (from the commandment of Allah) from Allah's chastisement: drowning (save him on whom He hath had mercy) except those upon whom Allah has mercy from among the believers. (And the wave came in between them) between Canaan and Noah; it is also said: between Canaan and the mountain, (so he was among the drowned) by the flood."
وَقِيلَ يٰأَرْضُ ٱبْلَعِي مَآءَكِ وَيٰسَمَآءُ أَقْلِعِي وَغِيضَ ٱلْمَآءُ وَقُضِيَ ٱلأَمْرُ وَٱسْتَوَتْ عَلَى ٱلْجُودِيِّ وَقِيلَ بُعْداً لِّلْقَوْمِ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ,"(And it was said: O earth! Swallow your water) dry your water (and, O sky! be cleared of clouds!) stop your rain! (And the water was made to subside. And the commandment was fulfilled) the destruction of those people was accomplished, i.e. those who were supposed to be destroyed were destroyed and those who were supposed to be saved were saved. (And it) the ship (came to rest upon (the mount) Al-Judi) a mountain in Nisibin in the land of Mosul (and it was said: A far removal) from Allah's mercy (for wrong-doing folk!) for the idolaters, the people of Noah."
وَنَادَى نُوحٌ رَّبَّهُ فَقَالَ رَبِّ إِنَّ ٱبْنِي مِنْ أَهْلِي وَإِنَّ وَعْدَكَ ٱلْحَقُّ وَأَنتَ أَحْكَمُ ٱلْحَاكِمِينَ,(And Noah cried unto) and Noah prayed to (his Lord and said: My Lord!) O my Lord! (Lo! my son) Canaan (is of my household) whom you promised to save! (Surely Thy promise is the Truth) for certain (and Thou art the Most Just of Judges) you promised to save me and my family.
قَالَ يٰنُوحُ إِنَّهُ لَيْسَ مِنْ أَهْلِكَ إِنَّهُ عَمَلٌ غَيْرُ صَالِحٍ فَلاَ تَسْئَلْنِ مَا لَيْسَ لَكَ بِهِ عِلْمٌ إِنِّيۤ أَعِظُكَ أَن تَكُونَ مِنَ ٱلْجَاهِلِينَ,"(He said) Allah said: (O Noah! Lo! he is not of your household) whom I promised to save; (lo! he is of evil conduct) engaged in idolatry; and according to a different reading this means: your prayer to Me to save him is not acceptable, (so ask not of Me) to save (that whereof thou hast no knowledge) that he is deserving of being saved. (I admonish thee) I warn you (lest thou be among the ignorant) by asking Me that which you know not."
قَالَ رَبِّ إِنِّيۤ أَعُوذُ بِكَ أَنْ أَسْأَلَكَ مَا لَيْسَ لِي بِهِ عِلْمٌ وَإِلاَّ تَغْفِرْ لِي وَتَرْحَمْنِيۤ أَكُن مِّنَ ٱلْخَاسِرِينَ,(He said) Noah said: (My Lord!) O my Lord! (Lo! in Thee do I seek refuge (from the sin) that I should ask of Thee) to save (that whereof I have no knowledge) that he deserves to be saved. (Unless Thou forgive me) Noah says: unless you overlook my error (and have mercy on me) such that You do not punish me (I shall be among the lost) through being punished.
قِيلَ يٰنُوحُ ٱهْبِطْ بِسَلاَمٍ مِّنَّا وَبَركَاتٍ عَلَيْكَ وَعَلَىٰ أُمَمٍ مِّمَّن مَّعَكَ وَأُمَمٌ سَنُمَتِّعُهُمْ ثُمَّ يَمَسُّهُمْ مِّنَّا عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,"(It was said (unto him): O Noah! Go thou down) get out of the ship (with peace from Us) with safety from Us (and blessings) good fortunes (upon you and some nations) some groups (from those with thee) in the ship among the felicitous. ((There will be other) nations) hosts of people from their offspring (unto whom We shall give enjoyment a long while) We will give them enjoyment after coming out of the loins of their parents (and then a painful doom from Us will overtake them) after they disbelieve, these are the damned among them. Ibn 'Abbas, may Allah be well pleased with him, said: “Allah sent His revelation to Noah (pbuh) when the latter was 480 years old; he preached to his people for 120 years; he boarded the ship when he was 600 years old; he lived after the flood 350 years, and stayed on the ship for five months. The ship was 300 cubits (the measure of his arm) long, 50 cubits wide, and its height 30 cubits. It had three decks, some of which were lower than others. In the lower deck, he put beasts of prey and reptiles; in the intermediate deck wild animals and beasts; and in the higher deck people who were 80 in number: 40 men and 40 women. The men and the women were separated by the body of Adam (pbuh). Noah had three of his sons with him: Shem, Ham and Yapheth”."
تِلْكَ مِنْ أَنْبَآءِ ٱلْغَيْبِ نُوحِيهَآ إِلَيْكَ مَا كُنتَ تَعْلَمُهَآ أَنتَ وَلاَ قَوْمُكَ مِن قَبْلِ هَـٰذَا فَٱصْبِرْ إِنَّ ٱلْعَاقِبَةَ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ,"(This is of the tidings of the Unseen) this is of the news of what has been hidden from you (which We inspire in thee) with which We sent Gabriel to you, O Muhammad, about the news of past nations. (Thou thyself knewest it not) i.e. you knew not the news of these past nations, (nor did thy folk (know it) before this) before the revelation of the Qur'an. (Then have patience) O Muhammad in the face of their denial and harm. (Lo! the sequel) the end result: victory and Paradise (is for those who ward off (evil)) ward off disbelief, idolatry and indecencies."
وَإِلَىٰ عَادٍ أَخَاهُمْ هُوداً قَالَ يٰقَوْمِ ٱعْبُدُواْ ٱللَّهَ مَا لَكُمْ مِّنْ إِلَـٰهٍ غَيْرُهُ إِنْ أَنتُمْ إِلاَّ مُفْتَرُونَ,"(And unto (the tribe of) 'Aad) and We sent to 'Aad (their brother) their Prophet, (Hud. He said: O my people! Serve Allah!) confess Allah's divine Oneness (ye have no other God save Him) save the One I am commanding you to believe in. (Lo! ye do) in your worship of idols (but invent!) lies about Allah for He never commanded you to worship them."

I ask of you no reward) no price (for it) for believing in Allah's divine Oneness. (Lo! my reward is the concern only of Him who made me) Who created me. (Have ye then no sense?) do you not believe? Are you not possessed of the same mind that human beings possess?
وَيٰقَوْمِ ٱسْتَغْفِرُواْ رَبَّكُمْ ثُمَّ تُوبُوۤاْ إِلَيْهِ يُرْسِلِ ٱلسَّمَآءَ عَلَيْكُمْ مِّدْرَاراً وَيَزِدْكُمْ قُوَّةً إِلَىٰ قُوَّتِكُمْ وَلاَ تَتَوَلَّوْاْ مُجْرِمِينَ,"(And, O my people! Ask forgiveness of your Lord) believe in Allah's divine Oneness, (then turn unto Him repentant) then betake yourself to Him through repentance and sincerity; (He will cause the sky to rain abundance on you) whenever you need it (and will add unto you strength to your strength) by giving you wealth and offspring. (Turn not away) from faith and repentance, (guilty!) associating others with Allah."
قَالُواْ يٰهُودُ مَا جِئْتَنَا بِبَيِّنَةٍ وَمَا نَحْنُ بِتَارِكِيۤ آلِهَتِنَا عَن قَوْلِكَ وَمَا نَحْنُ لَكَ بِمُؤْمِنِينَ,"(They said: O Hud! Thou hast brought us no clear proof) for what you claim (and we are not going to forsake our gods) the worship of our gods (on thy (mere) saying, and we are not believers in thee) we are not believers in your message."

(He said: I call Allah to witness, and do ye (too) bear witness, that I am innocent of (all) that ye ascribe as partners (to Allah)) of idols."
مِن دُونِهِ فَكِيدُونِي جَمِيعاً ثُمَّ لاَ تُنظِرُونِ,"And I am innocent of your worship of these idols (Beside Him. So (try to) circumvent me) work to destroy me, you and your idols, (all of you, give me no respite) neither delay nor pity on me."

I have put my trust in Allah) I consign my matter to Allah, (my Lord) my Creator and Provider (and your Lord) your Creator and Provider. (Not an animal but He doth grasp it by the forelock!) He makes die and brings back to life; it is also said that this means: they are all in His grip, He does what He will (Lo! my Lord is on a straight path) upon which people must tread; it is also said that means: He calls on to a straight path: an established religion with which He is pleased, i.e. Islam."
فَإِن تَوَلَّوْاْ فَقَدْ أَبْلَغْتُكُمْ مَّآ أُرْسِلْتُ بِهِ إِلَيْكُمْ وَيَسْتَخْلِفُ رَبِّي قَوْماً غَيْرَكُمْ وَلاَ تَضُرُّونَهُ شَيْئاً إِنَّ رَبِّي عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ حَفِيظٌ,"(And if ye turn away) from faith and repentance, (still I have conveyed unto you that wherewith I was sent unto you) of the message and about your destruction, (and my Lord will set in place of you a folk other than you) who are better and more obedient than you. (Ye cannot injure Him at all) your destruction will not harm Allah in any way. (Lo! my Lord is Guardian) and Witness (over all things) related to your works."
وَلَمَّا جَآءَ أَمْرُنَا نَجَّيْنَا هُوداً وَٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ مَعَهُ بِرَحْمَةٍ مِّنَّا وَنَجَّيْنَاهُمْ مِّنْ عَذَابٍ غَلِيظٍ,(And when Our commandment) Our chastisement (came to pass We saved Hud and those who believed with him by a mercy from Us) by a grace from Us; (We saved them from a harsh doom) a severe chastisement.

They denied the revelations of their Lord) which were brought to them by Hud (and flouted His messengers) concerning the declaration of Allah's divine Oneness (and followed the command of every froward) and they followed the words of every tyrant who kills upon being angry (potentate) and who turns away from Allah.

(He brought you forth from the earth) He created you from Adam and Adam is from the earth (and hath made you husband it) He made you thrive in the earth and made its inhabitants thrive on it too.

Thou hast been among us hitherto) i.e. before you called us to follow other than the religion of our forefathers (as that wherein our hope was placed) we had hope in you. (Dost thou ask us not to worship what our fathers worshipped) of idols? (Lo! we verily are in grave doubt concerning that to which thou callest us) i.e. your religion.
قَالَ يٰقَوْمِ أَرَأَيْتُمْ إِن كُنتُ عَلَىٰ بَيِّنَةً مِّن رَّبِّي وَآتَانِي مِنْهُ رَحْمَةً فَمَن يَنصُرُنِي مِنَ ٱللَّهِ إِنْ عَصَيْتُهُ فَمَا تَزِيدُونَنِي غَيْرَ تَخْسِيرٍ,"(He said: O my people!

(Ye would add to me naught save perdition) I only increase in insight about your loss."
وَيٰقَوْمِ هَـٰذِهِ نَاقَةُ ٱللَّهِ لَكُمْ آيَةً فَذَرُوهَا تَأْكُلْ فِيۤ أَرْضِ ٱللَّهِ وَلاَ تَمَسُّوهَا بِسُوۤءٍ فَيَأْخُذَكُمْ عَذَابٌ قَرِيبٌ,"(O my people!

فَعَقَرُوهَا فَقَالَ تَمَتَّعُواْ فِي دَارِكُمْ ثَلاَثَةَ أَيَّامٍ ذٰلِكَ وَعْدٌ غَيْرُ مَكْذُوبٍ,"(But they hamstrung her) they killed her. She was killed by Qudar Ibn Salif and Musda' Ibn Zahr who divided its meat on 1500 homes, (and then he said) Salih said to them after they killed the camel: (Enjoy life in your dwelling-place) in your township (three days!) for Allah's chastisement will come upon you on the fourth day. They asked him: “What is the sign of this chastisement?” He said: “You will wake up the first day with pale faces; on the second day your faces will be red and on the third your faces will become dark. Chastisement will come upon you on the fourth day”. (This) chastisement (is a threat that will not be belied) will not be repelled."

(They said: Peace!) they greeted Abraham when they entered in on him. (He answered: Peace!) He greeted them back (and delayed not) after a short while he went (to bring a roasted calf) a fat roasted calf which he placed in front of them.
فَلَمَّا رَأَى أَيْدِيَهُمْ لاَ تَصِلُ إِلَيْهِ نَكِرَهُمْ وَأَوْجَسَ مِنْهُمْ خِيفَةً قَالُواْ لاَ تَخَفْ إِنَّا أُرْسِلْنَا إِلَىٰ قَوْمِ لُوطٍ,"(And when he saw their hands reached not to it) to his food, because they had no need for it, (he mistrusted them and conceived a fear of them) thinking they were thieves, since they did not touch his food.

(The mercy of Allah and His blessings be upon you, O people of the house) the people of the house of Abraham! (Lo! He is Owner of Praise) for your works, (Owner of Glory!) He is Generous and will favour you with a righteous son."

(Beware of Allah) fear Allah regarding the unlawful, (and degrade me not in (the person of) my guests) do not humiliate me in front of my guests. (Is there not among you any upright man) to guide you to what is right, enjoin good and forbid evil?"

قَالَ لَوْ أَنَّ لِي بِكُمْ قُوَّةً أَوْ آوِيۤ إِلَىٰ رُكْنٍ شَدِيدٍ,(He said) Lot said within himself: (Would that I had strength) physical strength and sons to help me (to resist you or had some strong support (among you)!) or that I could rely on a strong clan such that I defend myself from you.

(Lo! that which smites them) of chastisement (will smiteth her (also). Lo! their tryst) to be destroyed (is (for) the morning) Lot said: “make that happen now,” and Gabriel said: “O Lot!” (Is not the morning nigh?) because he already saw it while Lot did not."
فَلَمَّا جَآءَ أَمْرُنَا جَعَلْنَا عَالِيَهَا سَافِلَهَا وَأَمْطَرْنَا عَلَيْهَا حِجَارَةً مِّن سِجِّيلٍ مَّنْضُودٍ,"(So when Our commandment) when Our chastisement (came to pass) to destroy them (We overthrew (that township)) We turned it upside down (and rained upon it) upon its sodomites and those who travelled there (stones of clay) mixed with manure and mud, like bricks; it is also said that this means: from the first heaven, (one after another) in succession, one after another,"

(And they) i.e. the stones (are never far from the wrong-doers) they did not miss them but rather hit them; it is also said that this means: these stones are never far from the wrong-doers, who emulate their practice, from among your nation."
وَإِلَىٰ مَدْيَنَ أَخَاهُمْ شُعَيْباً قَالَ يٰقَوْمِ ٱعْبُدُواْ ٱللَّهَ مَا لَكُمْ مِّنْ إِلَـٰهٍ غَيْرُهُ وَلاَ تَنقُصُواْ ٱلْمِكْيَالَ وَٱلْمِيزَانَ إِنِّيۤ أَرَاكُمْ بِخَيْرٍ وَإِنِّيۤ أَخَافُ عَلَيْكُمْ عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ مُّحِيطٍ,"(And unto Midian) and We sent to Midian (their brother Shu'ayb) their Prophet Jethro. (He said: O my people! Serve Allah) declare Allah's divine Oneness. (Ye have no other God save Him!) you have no other god except the One I command you to believe in (And give not short measure and short weight) do not take people's right in measure and weight. (Lo! I see you well to do) I see that you are at ease, possess wealth and the prices are quite low, (and lo! I fear for you) if you do not believe in Him and do not give the right measure and weight (the doom of a besetting Day) a doom that will encompass all of you such that none will escape from drought, lack of foodstuffs and other bad things."
وَيٰقَوْمِ أَوْفُواْ ٱلْمِكْيَالَ وَٱلْمِيزَانَ بِٱلْقِسْطِ وَلاَ تَبْخَسُواْ ٱلنَّاسَ أَشْيَآءَهُمْ وَلاَ تَعْثَوْاْ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ مُفْسِدِينَ,"(O my people! Give full measure and full weight in justice, and wrong not people about their goods.

قَالُواْ يٰشُعَيْبُ أَصَلَٰوتُكَ تَأْمُرُكَ أَن نَّتْرُكَ مَا يَعْبُدُ ءابَاؤُنَآ أَوْ أَن نَّفْعَلَ فِيۤ أَمْوَالِنَا مَا نَشَاءُ إِنَّكَ لأَنتَ ٱلْحَلِيمُ ٱلرَّشِيدُ,"(They said: O Shu'ayb! Doth thy way of prayer) do your abundant prayers (command thee that we should forsake that which our fathers (used to) worship) of idols, (or that we (should leave off) doing what we will with our own property) such as cheating in measure and weighing. (Lo! thou art the mild, the guide to right behaviour) they said this in derision, meaning to say: it is you who is the impudent and misguided."
قَالَ يٰقَوْمِ أَرَأَيْتُمْ إِن كُنتُ عَلَىٰ بَيِّنَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّي وَرَزَقَنِي مِنْهُ رِزْقاً حَسَناً وَمَآ أُرِيدُ أَنْ أُخَالِفَكُمْ إِلَىٰ مَآ أَنْهَاكُمْ عَنْهُ إِنْ أُرِيدُ إِلاَّ ٱلإِصْلاَحَ مَا ٱسْتَطَعْتُ وَمَا تَوْفِيقِيۤ إِلاَّ بِٱللَّهِ عَلَيْهِ تَوَكَّلْتُ وَإِلَيْهِ أُنِيبُ,(He said: O my people! Bethink you: if I am) He says: I am ((acting) on a clear proof from my Lord) on a clear exposition that has come down to me from my Lord (and He sustaineth me with fair sustenance from Him) and He has favoured me with prophethood and Islam and further gave me a lawful property ((how can I concede aught to you)? I desire not to do behind your backs that which I ask you not to do) he says: I do not want to engage in that which I am warning you against: cheating in measure and weighing. (I desire naught save) I only desire (reform) justice in measure and weighing (so far as I am able. My welfare) in upholding right measurement and weighing (is only in Allah) is only from Allah. (In Him I trust) I entrust my matter to Him (and unto Him I turn) in complete devotion.

(Lo! my Lord is, Merciful) towards His believing servants, (Loving) He forgives and rewards them; it is also said that this means: He loves them and makes His obedience beloved to them."
قَالُواْ يٰشُعَيْبُ مَا نَفْقَهُ كَثِيراً مِّمَّا تَقُولُ وَإِنَّا لَنَرَاكَ فِينَا ضَعِيفاً وَلَوْلاَ رَهْطُكَ لَرَجَمْنَاكَ وَمَآ أَنتَ عَلَيْنَا بِعَزِيزٍ,"(They said: O Shu'ayb! We understand not much of that thou tellest) of that you command us, (and lo! we do behold you weak) blind (among us. But for your family) your clan, (we should have stoned thee) killed you, (for thou art not strong against us) for you are not favoured at all among us."

Is my family) my clan (more to be honoured by you than Allah) than Allah's Book and religion; it is also said that this means: is the punishment of my clan more severe to you than Allah's chastisement? (And ye put Him) you placed Him (behind you, neglected) behind your back, i.e. you put that which I brought of the Book behind your backs. (Lo! my Lord surroundeth) knows (what ye do) the punishment you deserve for what you do."

I am watcher with you) I am also waiting for your destruction."
وَلَمَّا جَآءَ أَمْرُنَا نَجَّيْنَا شُعَيْباً وَٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ مَعَهُ بِرَحْمَةٍ مِّنَّا وَأَخَذَتِ ٱلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ الصَّيْحَةُ فَأَصْبَحُواْ فِي دِيَارِهِمْ جَاثِمِينَ,"(And when Our commandment) Our chastisement (came to pass we saved Shu'ayb and those who believed with Him by a mercy from Us) by a grace from Us; (and the (Awful) Cry) announcing chastisement (seized those who did injustice) the idolaters, i.e. the people of Shu'ayb, (and morning found them prostrate) dead, turned into dust (in their dwellings) in their houses."
كَأَن لَّمْ يَغْنَوْاْ فِيهَآ أَلاَ بُعْداً لِّمَدْيَنَ كَمَا بَعِدَتْ ثَمُودُ,"(As though they had not dwelt there) it was as if they never lived on this earth. (A far removal for Midian) the people of Shu'ayb from the mercy of Allah, (even as Thamud) the people of Salih (had been removed afar) from the mercy of Allah! The people of Salih and the people of Shu'ayb were punished by the same chastisement. They were seized by the Cry that announced their chastisement, followed by extreme heat. This heat came to the people of Salih from beneath their feet while it came to the people of Shu'ayb from above their heads."
وَلَقَدْ أَرْسَلْنَا مُوسَىٰ بِآيَاتِنَا وَسُلْطَانٍ مُّبِينٍ,"(And verily We sent Moses with Our revelations) with nine signs (and a clear warrant) and a clear proof, the signs being themselves clear proof."

Ah, hapless is the watering-place (whither they are) led) evil is the leader and evil are those that were led; it is also said that this means: evil are those entering, Pharaoh and his people, and evil is that where they will enter: the Fire."
وَأُتْبِعُواْ فِي هَـٰذِهِ لَعْنَةً وَيَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ بِئْسَ ٱلرِّفْدُ ٱلْمَرْفُودُ,"(A curse is made to follow them in the world) they were destroyed in the life of this world through drowning (and on the Day of Resurrection) they will receive another curse, i.e. the Fire.

(We relate it unto thee (Muhammad)) We send Gabriel down to you with their news. (Some of them are standing) and can be seen while their people have vanished (and some (already) reaped) and some of them have turned into ruin, the people and the townships."

Herein) in that which We mentioned to you (verily there is a portent) a lesson (for those who fear the doom of the Hereafter) such that they do not follow in their footsteps. (That is a day) the Day of Resurrection (unto which mankind will be gathered) the first and last among mankind will be gathered, (and that is a day that will be witnessed) it will be witnessed by the dwellers of heaven and earth."
وَمَا نُؤَخِّرُهُ إِلاَّ لأَجَلٍ مَّعْدُودٍ,(And We defer it) i.e. that day (only as a term already reckoned) only to an appointed time.

Allah will enter these into Paradise because of their pure faith. (Lo! thy Lord is Doer of what He will) as He will."
وَأَمَّا ٱلَّذِينَ سُعِدُواْ فَفِي ٱلْجَنَّةِ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا مَا دَامَتِ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتُ وَٱلأَرْضُ إِلاَّ مَا شَآءَ رَبُّكَ عَطَآءً غَيْرَ مَجْذُوذٍ,"(And as for those who will be glad) those who were decreed to be felicitous ((that day) they will be in the Garden, abiding there) in Paradise (so long as the heavens and the earth endure save for that which thy Lord willeth) when He wills to turn them from felicity to damnation due to His saying (Allah effaceth what He will, and establishes [13:39]); it is also said: they will abide in Paradise for as long as the heavens and the earth subsist: the heaven of Paradise and the earth of Paradise unless Allah wills to torment some people before making them enter Paradise, such that He puts them first in hell and then gets them out of it and puts them in Paradise, to abide therein forever: (a gift) a reward for them (unfailing) undiminished and uninterrupted."

They worship only as their fathers worshipped aforetime) before them and they were destroyed because of it. (Lo! We shall pay them their whole due) their chastisement (unabated) it is said that the last part of this verse was revealed about the Qadariyyah.
وَلَقَدْ آتَيْنَا مُوسَىٰ ٱلْكِتَابَ فَٱخْتُلِفَ فِيهِ وَلَوْلاَ كَلِمَةٌ سَبَقَتْ مِن رَّبِّكَ لَقُضِيَ بَيْنَهُمْ وَإِنَّهُمْ لَفِي شَكٍّ مِّنْهُ مُرِيبٍ,"(And We verily gave unto Moses the Scripture) i.e. the Torah, (and there was strife thereupon) about the Scripture of Moses: some believed in it while others did not; (and had it not been for a Word that had already gone forth) enjoined (from thy Lord) to delay His chastisement from your nation, (the case would have been judged between them) their destruction would have already happened and chastisement would have seized them, (and Lo! they are in grave doubt) manifest doubt (concerning it)."

(Lo! good deeds) the five daily prayers (annul ill deeds) sins other than the enormities; it is also said that the good deeds refer to the formulas: “Glory be to Allah”, “Praise be to Allah”, “there is no god save Allah” and “Allah is the greatest”. (This is a reminder for the mindful) this is an act of repentance for those who repent; it is also said that this means: these expiate the sins of the repentant. This verse was revealed about a man called Abu'l-Yusr Ibn 'Umar."
وَٱصْبِرْ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لاَ يُضِيعُ أَجْرَ ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,"(And have patience), O Muhammad, regarding that with which you have been commanded and also in the face of their harm (for lo!

(The wrong-doers followed) the idolaters engaged in (that by which they were made sapless) the comfort and wealth which they were given in this world, (and were guilty) idolaters."

(And the Word of thy Lord hath been fulfilled) the Word of your Lord has been decreed: (Verily I shall fill hell with the jinn and mankind together) with the disbelievers among the jinn and humans."

(And herein hath come unto thee) in this surah (the Truth) the news of the Truth (and an exhortation) to avoid transgression (and a reminder) an admonition (for believers)."
وَقُل لِّلَّذِينَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ ٱعْمَلُواْ عَلَىٰ مَكَانَتِكُمْ إِنَّا عَامِلُونَ,(And say unto those who believe not) in Allah and the Last Day nor in the revealed Scriptures and prophets: (Act according to your power) in your dwellings act according to your religion so as to destroy me. (Lo! we (too) are acting) to destroy you.

(So worship Him) so obey Him (and put thy trust in Him) rely on Him. (Lo! thy Lord is not unaware of what ye (mortals) do) of transgressions; it is also said that this means: Allah will not fail to punish you for what you do nor is He oblivious to it'."
الۤر تِلْكَ آيَاتُ ٱلْكِتَابِ ٱلْمُبِينِ,"And from his own narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said in the explanation of the saying of Allah, Exalted is He, (Alif. Lam. Ra.): '(Alif. Lam. Ra.) Allah says: I am Allah, I see what you do and what you say. That which Muhammad (pbuh) recites unto you is My speech; it is also said that (Alif. Lam. Ra.) is an oath that Allah swore by. (These are verses of the Scripture that maketh plain) this surah, or verses of the Qur'an, expounds the lawful and unlawful, the commands and prohibitions."

We have revealed it, a Lecture in Arabic) He says: We have sent down Gabriel with the Qur'an to Muhammad in accordance with the usage of the Arabic language, (that ye may understand) that which you were commanded to do and that in which you were prohibited from engaging."
نَحْنُ نَقُصُّ عَلَيْكَ أَحْسَنَ ٱلْقَصَصِ بِمَآ أَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَيْكَ هَـٰذَا ٱلْقُرْآنَ وَإِن كُنتَ مِن قَبْلِهِ لَمِنَ ٱلْغَافِلِينَ,"(We narrate unto thee (Muhammad)) We clarify to you (the best of narratives) the best story of the news of Joseph and his brothers (in that We have inspired in you) with which We inspired through Gabriel (this Qur'an) in this Qur'an, (though aforetime) before Gabriel brought down the Qur'an to you (thou wast of the heedless) in relation to the event of Joseph and his brothers."
إِذْ قَالَ يُوسُفُ لأَبِيهِ يٰأَبتِ إِنِّي رَأَيْتُ أَحَدَ عَشَرَ كَوْكَباً وَٱلشَّمْسَ وَٱلْقَمَرَ رَأَيْتُهُمْ لِي سَاجِدِينَ,"(When Joseph said unto his father: O my father! Lo! I saw in a dream) that I dreamt during the day (eleven planets) they came down from their orbits and prostrated themselves before me, a prostration of greeting-these are his brothers who were eleven in number-(and the sun and the moon, I saw them prostrating themselves unto me) he says: and I saw the sun and the moon coming down from their orbits and prostrated themselves before me, a prostration of greeting-these are his parents: Rachel and Jacob."
قَالَ يٰبُنَيَّ لاَ تَقْصُصْ رُؤْيَاكَ عَلَىٰ إِخْوَتِكَ فَيَكِيدُواْ لَكَ كَيْداً إِنَّ ٱلشَّيْطَانَ لِلإِنْسَانِ عَدُوٌّ مُّبِينٌ,"(He said) Jacob confided to Joseph, saying: (O my dear son!) if you see any other dream in the future (Tell not) do not inform (thy brethren of your vision, lest they plot a plot against thee) that may lead to your peril. (Lo! Satan is for man) for the children of Adam (an open foe) with manifest enmity, and he drives them to resentful envy."
وَكَذٰلِكَ يَجْتَبِيكَ رَبُّكَ وَيُعَلِّمُكَ مِن تَأْوِيلِ ٱلأَحَادِيثِ وَيُتِمُّ نِعْمَتَهُ عَلَيْكَ وَعَلَىٰ ءَالِ يَعْقُوبَ كَمَآ أَتَمَّهَآ عَلَىٰ أَبَوَيْكَ مِن قَبْلُ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَإِسْحَاقَ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ عَلِيمٌ حَكِيمٌ,"(Thus thy Lord will prefer thee) select you to be a prophet (and will teach thee the interpretation of events) the interpretation of dreams, (and will perfect his grace upon thee) by means of prophethood and Islam and will make you die as a prophet and one completely surrendered to Allah (and upon the family of Jacob) through you, i.e. He will perfect His grace on the children of Jacob through you (as he perfected it) as He perfected His grace by means of prophethood and Islam (upon thy forefathers) before you, (Abraham and Isaac. Lo! thy Lord is Knower) of His grace, (Wise) in that He perfects it; it is also said that this means: your Lord is Knower of your dream vision, Wise regarding that which will befall you."
لَّقَدْ كَانَ فِي يُوسُفَ وَإِخْوَتِهِ آيَاتٌ لِّلسَّائِلِينَ,(Verily in Joseph) in the narrative of Joseph (and his brethren are signs (of Allah's Sovereignty)) lessons (for the inquiring) about his story. This verse was revealed about a Jewish rabbi.
إِذْ قَالُواْ لَيُوسُفُ وَأَخُوهُ أَحَبُّ إِلَىٰ أَبِينَا مِنَّا وَنَحْنُ عُصْبَةٌ إِنَّ أَبَانَا لَفِي ضَلاَلٍ مُّبِينٍ,"(When they said) i.e. when the brothers of Joseph said to one another: (Verily Joseph and his brother) Benjamin (are dearer to our father) are more preferred by our father (than we are, many though we be) though we are ten in number. (Lo! our father is in plain aberration) our father is in manifest error regarding the love of Joseph and his preference over us."
ٱقْتُلُواْ يُوسُفَ أَوِ ٱطْرَحُوهُ أَرْضاً يَخْلُ لَكُمْ وَجْهُ أَبِيكُمْ وَتَكُونُواْ مِن بَعْدِهِ قَوْماً صَالِحِينَ,"Then they said to one another: (Kill Joseph or cast him to some (other) land) in a pit, (so that your father's favour may be all for you) so that your father may turn entirely to you, (and (that) ye may afterward) after killing him (be righteous folk) repentant for killing him; it is also said that this means: your relationship with your father will improve."
قَالَ قَآئِلٌ مِّنْهُمْ لاَ تَقْتُلُواْ يُوسُفَ وَأَلْقُوهُ فِي غَيَٰبَتِ ٱلْجُبِّ يَلْتَقِطْهُ بَعْضُ ٱلسَّيَّارَةِ إِن كُنتُمْ فَاعِلِينَ,"(One among them) one of the brothers who is Yehuda (said: Kill not Joseph but, if ye must be doing) something to him, (fling him into the depth of the pit) in the bottom of the pit or in the darkness of the pit; (some caravan) travellers passing by (will find him) will get him out."
قَالُواْ يَٰأَبَانَا مَا لَكَ لاَ تَأْمَنَّا عَلَىٰ يُوسُفَ وَإِنَّا لَهُ لَنَاصِحُونَ,"Then they went to their father, (They said) to their father: (O our father! Why wilt thou not trust us with Joseph, when lo! we are good friends to him) we will protect him?"
أَرْسِلْهُ مَعَنَا غَداً يَرْتَعْ وَيَلْعَبْ وَإِنَّا لَهُ لَحَافِظُونَ,"(Send him with us tomorrow that he may enjoy himself) come, go and move about (and play) and have fun. (And lo! we shall take good care of him) we will be kind to him."
قَالَ إِنِّي لَيَحْزُنُنِيۤ أَن تَذْهَبُواْ بِهِ وَأَخَافُ أَن يَأْكُلَهُ ٱلذِّئْبُ وَأَنْتُمْ عَنْهُ غَافِلُونَ,"(He said) their father said: (Lo! in truth it saddens me that ye should take him with you) such that I do not see him, (and I fear lest the wolf devour him) because he saw in his dream a wolf attacking Joseph (while ye are heedless of him) while you are busy with playing; it is also said that this means: while you are busy with your chores."
قَالُواْ لَئِنْ أَكَلَهُ ٱلذِّئْبُ وَنَحْنُ عُصْبَةٌ إِنَّآ إِذَاً لَّخَاسِرُونَ,"(They said) to their father: (If the wolf should devour him when we are (so strong) a band) ten of us, (then surely we should have already perished) we should be very weak; it is also said that this means: we should be really losers by neglecting the inviolability of our father and brother."
فَلَمَّا ذَهَبُواْ بِهِ وَأَجْمَعُوۤاْ أَن يَجْعَلُوهُ فِي غَيَٰبَتِ ٱلْجُبِّ وَأَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَيْهِ لَتُنَبِّئَنَّهُمْ بِأَمْرِهِمْ هَـٰذَا وَهُمْ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ,"(Then, when they led him off) after Jacob gave them permission to take him, (and were of one mind that they should place him in the depth of the pit) and they were unanimous about throwing him into the depth of the pit, (We inspired in him) We sent to him Gabriel to inform him; it is also said this means: We directly inspired him: (Thou wilt tell them) you will inform them, O Joseph, (of this deed of theirs) of this act of theirs (when they know (thee) not) when they do not realise that it is you, Joseph, until you inform them of your identity; it is also said that this means: they know not our inspiration to you."
وَجَآءُوۤا أَبَاهُمْ عِشَآءً يَبْكُونَ,(And they came weeping to their father in the evening) after midday.
قَالُواْ يَٰأَبَانَآ إِنَّا ذَهَبْنَا نَسْتَبِقُ وَتَرَكْنَا يُوسُفَ عِندَ مَتَاعِنَا فَأَكَلَهُ ٱلذِّئْبُ وَمَآ أَنتَ بِمُؤْمِنٍ لَّنَا وَلَوْ كُنَّا صَادِقِينَ,"(Saying: O our father! We went racing one with another) and hunting, (and left Joseph by our things) to guard them, (and the wolf devoured him) as you said, (and thou believest not our sayings even when we speak the Truth)."
وَجَآءُوا عَلَىٰ قَمِيصِهِ بِدَمٍ كَذِبٍ قَالَ بَلْ سَوَّلَتْ لَكُمْ أَنفُسُكُمْ أَمْراً فَصَبْرٌ جَمِيلٌ وَٱللَّهُ ٱلْمُسْتَعَانُ عَلَىٰ مَا تَصِفُونَ,"(And they came with false blood on his shirt) they stained his shirt with the blood of a goat. (He said: Nay, but your minds have beguiled you into) they embellished to you to do (something) regarding the peril of Joseph and you did it. ((My course is) comely patience) I have only to be patient without showing any alarm. (And Allah it is whose help is to be sought) I seek the help of Allah (in that (predicament) which ye describe) to be patient for his death, as you say. But he did not believe them because in another occasion they said that Joseph was killed by thieves."
وَجَاءَتْ سَيَّارَةٌ فَأَرْسَلُواْ وَارِدَهُمْ فَأَدْلَىٰ دَلْوَهُ قَالَ يٰبُشْرَىٰ هَـٰذَا غُلاَمٌ وَأَسَرُّوهُ بِضَاعَةً وَٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ بِمَا يَعْمَلُونَ,"(And there came a caravan) of travellers from Midian who were going to Egypt. They lost their way and went round and round until they passed by the land where the pit was. This land is called Dawthan, midway between Midian and Egypt, and there the caravan decided to have a break, (and they sent their water-drawer) each group of people sent their water-drawer. The pit in which Joseph was thrown was the lot of an Arab man from Midian called Malik Ibn Du'ar who was the nephew of the Prophet Shu'ayb, Allah give him peace. (He let down his pail (into the pit)) and Joseph got hold of it such that the water-drawer could not pull it back. When he looked down he saw a boy grabbing the pail of water and so he called his companions. (He said: Good luck!) “This is my good luck, O my companions!” His companions asked him: “what is it, O Malik?” He said: (Here is a youth) the most handsome of youths. They gathered and got Joseph out of the pit. (And they hid him as a treasure) they concealed from their people the fact that they found him in the pit, and instead informed them that the owners of the pit entrusted them to sell him in Egypt for them (and Allah was Aware of what they did) to Joseph, i.e. what the brothers of Joseph did to him; it is also said that this refers to the people of the caravan."
وَشَرَوْهُ بِثَمَنٍ بَخْسٍ دَرَاهِمَ مَعْدُودَةٍ وَكَانُواْ فِيهِ مِنَ ٱلزَّاهِدِينَ,"(And they sold him) the brothers of Malik Ibn Du'ar bought him (for a low price) by cheating in weight; it is also said that he was bought with false money; and it was also said that he was bought with unlawful money, (a number of silver coins) 20 silver coins; it is also said: 32 silver coins; (and they attached no value to him) they were reluctant to buy him because they did not need him; it is also said that the brothers of Joseph attached no importance to Joseph because they did not know his standing and stature with Allah, Exalted is He. It is also said that the people of the caravan attached no value to Joseph."
وَقَالَ ٱلَّذِي ٱشْتَرَاهُ مِن مِّصْرَ لاِمْرَأَتِهِ أَكْرِمِي مَثْوَاهُ عَسَىٰ أَن يَنفَعَنَآ أَوْ نَتَّخِذَهُ وَلَداً وَكَذٰلِكَ مَكَّنَّا لِيُوسُفَ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَلِنُعَلِّمَهُ مِن تَأْوِيلِ ٱلأَحَادِيثِ وَٱللَّهُ غَالِبٌ عَلَىٰ أَمْرِهِ وَلَـٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ ٱلنَّاسِ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ,"(And he of Egypt) the Chief Official, who was the treasurer of the king and the chief of his soldiers. His name was Potiphar (Qitfir) (who purchased him said unto his wife) Zelicha (Zulaykha): Receive him honourably. Perchance he may prove useful to us) in our farm (or we may adopt him as a son). This man bought Joseph for the price of 20 silver coins, a garment and a pair of sandals. (Thus We established Joseph) We gave him authority (in the land) of Egypt (that We might teach him the interpretation of events) the interpretation of dreams. (And Allah was predominant in his career) Allah is dominant in things destined; no one can repel His destined things, (but most of mankind) the people of Egypt (know not) nor believe; it is also said that this means: most do not know that Allah is dominant in the things that He destined."
وَلَمَّا بَلَغَ أَشُدَّهُ آتَيْنَاهُ حُكْماً وَعِلْماً وَكَذٰلِكَ نَجْزِي ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,"(And when he reached his prime) between 18 and 30 years old (We gave him wisdom and knowledge) understanding and prophethood. (Thus We reward the good) in speech and works, in knowledge and wisdom."
وَرَاوَدَتْهُ ٱلَّتِي هُوَ فِي بَيْتِهَا عَن نَّفْسِهِ وَغَلَّقَتِ ٱلأَبْوَابَ وَقَالَتْ هَيْتَ لَكَ قَالَ مَعَاذَ ٱللَّهِ إِنَّهُ رَبِّيۤ أَحْسَنَ مَثْوَايَ إِنَّهُ لاَ يُفْلِحُ ٱلظَّالِمُونَ,"(And she, in whose house he was, asked of him an evil act. She bolted the doors) on her and Joseph (and said) to Joseph: (Come!) I am yours. (He said) Joseph said: (I seek refuge in Allah!) from such a thing. (Lo! he is my lord) The Chief Official, (who hath treated me honourably) in contrast to his own brothers. (Wrong-doers never prosper) adulterers will never be safe from or escape Allah's chastisement."
وَلَقَدْ هَمَّتْ بِهِ وَهَمَّ بِهَا لَوْلاۤ أَن رَّأَى بُرْهَانَ رَبِّهِ كَذَلِكَ لِنَصْرِفَ عَنْهُ ٱلسُّوۤءَ وَٱلْفَحْشَآءَ إِنَّهُ مِنْ عِبَادِنَا ٱلْمُخْلَصِينَ,"(She) the woman (verily desired him, and he) Joseph (would have desired her if it had not been that he saw the argument of his Lord) if he had not seen that the chastisement of his Lord would befall him; it is also said that this means: if he had not seen the figure of his father; and it is also said that this means: if he had not seen the proof of his Lord. (Thus it was, that We might ward off from him evil and lewdness) adultery. (Lo! he was of Our chosen slaves) who are protected from adultery."
وَٱسْتَبَقَا ٱلْبَابَ وَقَدَّتْ قَمِيصَهُ مِن دُبُرٍ وَأَلْفَيَا سَيِّدَهَا لَدَى ٱلْبَابِ قَالَتْ مَا جَزَآءُ مَنْ أَرَادَ بِأَهْلِكَ سُوۤءًا إِلاَّ أَن يُسْجَنَ أَوْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,"(And they raced with one another to the door) Joseph wanting to leave and her wanting to lock the door. The woman got there first (and she tore his shirt) in two (from behind) from the waist to his feet, (and they met her lord and master) the husband of the woman; and it is said: her cousin (at the door. She said) the woman said to her husband: (What shall be his reward, who wisheth evil) adultery (to your folk, save prison or a painful doom) be severely beaten?"
قَالَ هِيَ رَاوَدَتْنِي عَن نَّفْسِي وَشَهِدَ شَاهِدٌ مِّنْ أَهْلِهَآ إِن كَانَ قَمِيصُهُ قُدَّ مِن قُبُلٍ فَصَدَقَتْ وَهُوَ مِنَ الكَاذِبِينَ,"((Joseph) said: She it was who asked of me an evil act) it is her who called me and offered herself to me. (And in witness of her own folk testified) a man taken as judge from her own people, her brother and it is said her cousin, pronounced: (If his shirt) the shirt of Joseph (is torn from before) from the front, (then she speaketh truth) then the woman has spoken the Truth (and he is of the liars)."
وَإِنْ كَانَ قَمِيصُهُ قُدَّ مِن دُبُرٍ فَكَذَبَتْ وَهُوَ مِن الصَّادِقِينَ,"(And if his shirt is torn from behind) from the back, (then she hath lied) then the woman has lied (and he is of the Truthful) that she invited him to her."
فَلَمَّا رَأَى قَمِيصَهُ قُدَّ مِن دُبُرٍ قَالَ إِنَّهُ مِن كَيْدِكُنَّ إِنَّ كَيْدَكُنَّ عَظِيمٌ,"(So when he saw his shirt torn from behind, he said) her brother said: (Lo! this is of the guile) the scheming and devising (of you women. Lo! the guile of you is very great) it touches the innocent and the sick."
يُوسُفُ أَعْرِضْ عَنْ هَـٰذَا وَٱسْتَغْفِرِي لِذَنبِكِ إِنَّكِ كُنتِ مِنَ ٱلْخَاطِئِينَ,"Her brother then said to Joseph: (O Joseph! Turn away from this) and do not inform anyone. And then he turned to the woman and said: (and thou, (O woman), ask forgiveness for thy sin) seek your husband's forgiveness for your act. (Lo! thou art of the sinful) you cheated your husband."
وَقَالَ نِسْوَةٌ فِي ٱلْمَدِينَةِ ٱمْرَأَةُ ٱلْعَزِيزِ تُرَاوِدُ فَتَاهَا عَن نَّفْسِهِ قَدْ شَغَفَهَا حُبّاً إِنَّا لَنَرَاهَا فِي ضَلاَلٍ مُّبِينٍ,"However, the news of this incident spread in the city, (And women in the city) they were four women: the wife of the king's cupbearer, the wife of the king's head of prisons, the wife of the king's cook and the wife of the man in charge of the king's stable (said: The ruler's wife) Zelicha (is asking of her slave boy an ill deed) wants her slave boy to sleep with her. (Indeed he has smitten her to the heart with love. We behold her in plain aberration) she is plainly wrong in her love of her slave boy."
فَلَمَّا سَمِعَتْ بِمَكْرِهِنَّ أَرْسَلَتْ إِلَيْهِنَّ وَأَعْتَدَتْ لَهُنَّ مُتَّكَئاً وَآتَتْ كُلَّ وَاحِدَةٍ مِّنْهُنَّ سِكِّيناً وَقَالَتِ ٱخْرُجْ عَلَيْهِنَّ فَلَمَّا رَأَيْنَهُ أَكْبَرْنَهُ وَقَطَّعْنَ أَيْدِيَهُنَّ وَقُلْنَ حَاشَ لِلَّهِ مَا هَـٰذَا بَشَراً إِنْ هَـٰذَآ إِلاَّ مَلَكٌ كَرِيمٌ,"(And when she heard of their sly talk, she sent to them) an invitation (and prepared for them a cushioned couch) to lie on and then she had meat and bread brought to them (and gave to every one of them a knife) for they did not eat of meat except that which they could cut with their knives (and said) Zelicha said to Joseph: (Come out unto them!) O Joseph! (And when they saw him they exalted him and cut their hands, exclaiming: Allah Blameless!) Allah forbid! (This is not a human being. This is no other than some gracious angel) gracious in the sight of his Lord."
قَالَتْ فَذٰلِكُنَّ ٱلَّذِي لُمْتُنَّنِي فِيهِ وَلَقَدْ رَاوَدتُّهُ عَن نَّفْسِهِ فَٱسَتَعْصَمَ وَلَئِن لَّمْ يَفْعَلْ مَآ آمُرُهُ لَيُسْجَنَنَّ وَلَيَكُوناً مِّن ٱلصَّاغِرِينَ,"(She said) Zelicha said to them: (This is he on whose account you blamed me) and vilified me. (I asked of him an evil act) I wanted him to sleep with me, (but he proved continent) but he refused out of continence, (but if he do not my behest he verily shall be imprisoned, and verily shall him of those brought low) he will be humiliated in prison."
قَالَ رَبِّ ٱلسِّجْنُ أَحَبُّ إِلَيَّ مِمَّا يَدْعُونَنِيۤ إِلَيْهِ وَإِلاَّ تَصْرِفْ عَنِّي كَيْدَهُنَّ أَصْبُ إِلَيْهِنَّ وَأَكُن مِّنَ ٱلْجَاهِلِينَ,"These women said to Joseph. “Obey your mistress!” (He said) Joseph said: (O my Lord! Prison is more dear than that unto which they urge me) of adultery, (and if Thou fend not off their wiles) their scheming (from me I shall incline unto them and become of the foolish) who ignore Your blessing; it is also said that the foolish here refer to adulterers."
فَٱسْتَجَابَ لَهُ رَبُّهُ فَصَرَفَ عَنْهُ كَيْدَهُنَّ إِنَّهُ هُوَ ٱلسَّمِيعُ ٱلْعَلِيمُ,"(So his Lord heard his prayer and fended off their wiles from him. Lo! He is Hearer) of prayers, (Knower) of His answer; it is also said Hearer of the ladies' talk and Knower of their scheming."
ثُمَّ بَدَا لَهُمْ مِّن بَعْدِ مَا رَأَوُاْ ٱلآيَاتِ لَيَسْجُنُنَّهُ حَتَّىٰ حِينٍ,(And it seemed good to them) to the Chief Official (after they had seen the signs (of his innocence)) the torn shirt and the judgement of her brother (to imprison him for a time) a few years; it is also said that (for a time) means: until people stopped talking about it.
وَدَخَلَ مَعَهُ ٱلسِّجْنَ فَتَيَانِ قَالَ أَحَدُهُمَآ إِنِّيۤ أَرَانِيۤ أَعْصِرُ خَمْراً وَقَالَ ٱلآخَرُ إِنِّي أَرَانِيۤ أَحْمِلُ فَوْقَ رَأْسِي خُبْزاً تَأْكُلُ ٱلطَّيْرُ مِنْهُ نَبِّئْنَا بِتَأْوِيلِهِ إِنَّا نَرَاكَ مِنَ ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,"(And two young men) two slaves of the king: his cupbearer and his cook-he got angry with them and put them in prison-(went to prison with him) they stayed together five years. (One of them), the cupbearer, (said: I dreamed that I was pressing wine) pressing grapes to make wine and giving it to the king. This cupbearer saw in a dream that he entered a vineyard and there he saw a pleasant bough with three offshoots and on the offshoots bunches of grapes. He picked the grapes, pressed them and gave it to the King. Joseph said: “As for the vineyard, it is the job you had; the bough represents the expertise you have in your job; its pleasantness represents your position and merit in that job. The three offshoots mean that you will be released in three days and shall return to your job. The pressed grapes you gave to the king means that he will give you your job back, honour you and treat you well”. (The other) the cook, who prepared the king's bread (said I dreamed that I was carrying upon my head bread whereof the birds were eating) he saw in his dream that he was coming out of the king's kitchen carrying on his head three baskets of bread when birds came and ate from the bread on the baskets. Joseph said: “You have seen an evil thing. As for your going out of the King's kitchen, this means that you will lose your job; the three baskets means that you will stay in prison for three days. The birds eating from the baskets means that the king will get you out of prison in three days to crucify you and the birds will eat of your head”. Before Joseph interpreted their dreams for them, the two men said to him: (Announce unto us the interpretation) interpret for us our dreams, (for we see thee of those good) towards the prisoners; it is also said that this means: you are of those who are truthful in their speech."
قَالَ لاَ يَأْتِيكُمَا طَعَامٌ تُرْزَقَانِهِ إِلاَّ نَبَّأْتُكُمَا بِتَأْوِيلِهِ قَبْلَ أَن يَأْتِيكُمَا ذٰلِكُمَا مِمَّا عَلَّمَنِي رَبِّيۤ إِنِّي تَرَكْتُ مِلَّةَ قَوْمٍ لاَّ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱللَّهِ وَهُمْ بِٱلآخِرَةِ هُمْ كَافِرُونَ,"(He said) Joseph said to them, because he wanted to inform them about his knowledge of interpreting dreams: (The food which ye are given (daily) shall not come unto you but I shall tell you the interpretation) i.e. of its colour and type (ere it cometh unto you) so can I fail to interpret your dreams? (This) the interpretation of dreams (is of that which my Lord hath taught me. Lo! I have forsaken the religion of folk) I did not follow the religion of a people (who believe not in Allah and are disbelievers in) they are deniers of (the Hereafter) resurrection after death."
وَٱتَّبَعْتُ مِلَّةَ آبَآئِـيۤ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَإِسْحَاقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ مَا كَانَ لَنَآ أَن نُّشْرِكَ بِٱللَّهِ مِن شَيْءٍ ذٰلِكَ مِن فَضْلِ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْنَا وَعَلَى ٱلنَّاسِ وَلَـٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ ٱلنَّاسِ لاَ يَشْكُرُونَ,"(And I have followed the religion of my fathers) I held firm to the religion of my forefathers, (Abraham and Isaac and Jacob. It never was for us) it was not permissible for us (to attribute aught) any idols (as partner to Allah. This) pure Religion, prophethood and Islam with which Allah has honoured us (is of the bounty of Allah unto us) a blessing that Allah blessed us with (and unto mankind) by sending us to them; it is also said that this means: this is a bounty unto the believers through the blessing of faith; (but most men) the people of Egypt (give not thanks) do not believe in this."
يٰصَاحِبَيِ ٱلسِّجْنِ ءَأَرْبَابٌ مُّتَّفَرِّقُونَ خَيْرٌ أَمِ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْوَاحِدُ ٱلْقَهَّارُ,"(O my two fellow prisoners!) He said this to the prison master as well as to the prisoners (Are diverse lords better) is the worship of numerous gods better, (or Allah the One, the Almighty?) or the worship of Allah, the One Who has no son or partner, the All-Conquering over His created beings."
مَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِهِ إِلاَّ أَسْمَآءً سَمَّيْتُمُوهَآ أَنتُمْ وَآبَآؤُكُمْ مَّآ أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ بِهَا مِن سُلْطَانٍ إِنِ ٱلْحُكْمُ إِلاَّ للَّهِ أَمَرَ أَلاَّ تَعْبُدُوۤاْ إِلاَّ إِيَّاهُ ذٰلِكَ ٱلدِّينُ ٱلْقَيِّمُ وَلَـٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ ٱلنَّاسِ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ,"(Those whom ye worship beside Him) besides Allah (are but names) lifeless idols (which ye have named, ye and your fathers) you and your fathers called them gods. (Allah hath revealed no sanction) no Scripture or proof (for them) for your worship of them. (The decision) the judgement of commands and prohibitions; it is also said that this means: judgement in the life of this world and in the Hereafter (rests with Allah only, Who hath commanded you) in all revealed Scriptures (that ye worship) that you profess the divine Oneness of (none save Him) save Allah. (This) profession of divine Oneness (is the right religion) the established Religion that He is pleased with: i.e. Islam, (but most men) the people of Egypt (know not) this nor believe in it."
يٰصَاحِبَيِ ٱلسِّجْنِ أَمَّآ أَحَدُكُمَا فَيَسْقِي رَبَّهُ خَمْراً وَأَمَّا ٱلآخَرُ فَيُصْلَبُ فَتَأْكُلُ ٱلطَّيْرُ مِن رَّأْسِهِ قُضِيَ ٱلأَمْرُ ٱلَّذِي فِيهِ تَسْتَفْتِيَانِ,"Joseph them proceeded to interpret the dreams of the two prisoners, saying: (O my two fellow prisoners! As for one of you) the cupbearer, he will return to his former position and glory, (he will pour out wine for his lord) his master the king (to drink; and as for the other) the baker, he will leave prison, and (he will be crucified so that the birds will eat from his head) the two prisoner were alarmed upon hearing the interpretation of the baker's dream. Both of them hastened to say: “We have not seen any dreams!” But Joseph said to them: (Thus is the case judged concerning which ye did inquire) it will be just as I have informed you, whether you saw those dreams or not."
وَقَالَ لِلَّذِي ظَنَّ أَنَّهُ نَاجٍ مِّنْهُمَا ٱذْكُرْنِي عِندَ رَبِّكَ فَأَنْسَاهُ ٱلشَّيْطَانُ ذِكْرَ رَبِّهِ فَلَبِثَ فِي ٱلسِّجْنِ بِضْعَ سِنِينَ,"(And he said unto him of the twain who he knew would be released) from prison, i.e. the cupbearer: (Mention me in the presence of thy lord) your master the king; tell him that I have been wronged: my brothers sold me when I being a free man and I was put into prison while being innocent. (But Satan caused him to forget to mention it to his lord) Satan made him so preoccupied that he forgot to mention Joseph to his master, the king. It is also said that this means: Satan whispered to him: if you mention prison to the king, he will put you back in it. This is why he did not mention Joseph to the king; it is also said that the meaning of this is: Satan made Joseph forget the remembrance of his Lord and instead remembered a created being like him, (so he (Joseph) stayed in prison for some years) seven years, as a punishment for not mentioning Allah, when he had already spent five years in jail."
وَقَالَ ٱلْمَلِكُ إِنِّيۤ أَرَىٰ سَبْعَ بَقَرَاتٍ سِمَانٍ يَأْكُلُهُنَّ سَبْعٌ عِجَافٌ وَسَبْعَ سُنْبُلاَتٍ خُضْرٍ وَأُخَرَ يَابِسَاتٍ يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلْمَلأُ أَفْتُونِي فِي رُؤْيَايَ إِن كُنتُمْ لِلرُّءْيَا تَعْبُرُونَ,"(And the king said: Lo! I saw in a dream seven fat kine) coming out of a river (which seven lean were eating) the seven lean kine, that were dying of lack of nourishment swallowed up the fat kine, but even then it was as if they did not eat anything, (and seven green ears of corn and other (seven) dry) the dry ones coiling around the green ones such that they overshadowed their greenery and became unnoticeable. (O notables!) Meaning: the soothsayers, sorcerers and fortune-tellers, (Expound for me my vision) interpret for me my dream, (if ye can interpret dreams) if you know how to interpret dreams."
قَالُوۤاْ أَضْغَاثُ أَحْلاَمٍ وَمَا نَحْنُ بِتَأْوِيلِ ٱلأَحْلاَمِ بِعَالِمِينَ,"(They) i.e. the soothsayers, sorcerers and fortune-tellers (answered: Jumbled dreams!) these are false and unreal dreams. (And we are not knowing in the interpretation of dreams) we do not know how to interpret dreams."
وَقَالَ ٱلَّذِي نَجَا مِنْهُمَا وَٱدَّكَرَ بَعْدَ أُمَّةٍ أَنَاْ أُنَبِّئُكُمْ بِتَأْوِيلِهِ فَأَرْسِلُونِ,"(And he of the two who was released) from prison, i.e. the cupbearer, (and (now) at length) after seven years (remembered) remembered Joseph, (said: I am going to announce unto you the interpretation) he said to the king: I will inform you of the interpretation of your dream, (therefore send me forth) to prison for there is a man there who knows the interpretation of dreams. And he described Joseph's knowledge, clemency and goodness towards the prisoners and his expertise in interpreting dreams. And so he was sent."
يُوسُفُ أَيُّهَا ٱلصِّدِّيقُ أَفْتِنَا فِي سَبْعِ بَقَرَاتٍ سِمَانٍ يَأْكُلُهُنَّ سَبْعٌ عِجَافٌ وَسَبْعِ سُنبُلاَتٍ خُضْرٍ وَأُخَرَ يَابِسَاتٍ لَّعَلِّيۤ أَرْجِعُ إِلَى ٱلنَّاسِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَعْلَمُونَ,"When he went to him, he said: (Joseph! O thou truthful one!) O you who were truthful in interpreting the first dream, (Expound for us the seven fat kine) that came out of the river and (which seven lean) that were dying of lack of nourishment (were eating and the seven green ears of corn and other (seven) dry) coiling around the seven green ears, overshadowing their greenery, (that I may return unto the people) to the king, (so that they may know) the interpretation of the king's dream. Joseph said: “Yes! I will interpret his dream. The seven fat kine are seven years of soil fertility, and the seven green ears represent abundance and low prices during these seven years. The seven dying, lean kine represent years of drought while the seven dry ears represent lack of foodstuff and high prices during these years”."
قَالَ تَزْرَعُونَ سَبْعُ سِنِينَ دَأَباً فَمَا حَصَدتُّمْ فَذَرُوهُ فِي سُنبُلِهِ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً مِّمَّا تَأْكُلُونَ,"Joseph then instructed them what to do. (He said: Ye shall sow seven years as usual) each year continuously, (but that which ye reap) of crops, (leave it in the ear) and do not thresh it, this is better for its preservation, (all save a little which ye eat) all save the quantity which you need for your sustenance."
ثُمَّ يَأْتِي مِن بَعْدِ ذٰلِكَ سَبْعٌ شِدَادٌ يَأْكُلْنَ مَا قَدَّمْتُمْ لَهُنَّ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً مِّمَّا تُحْصِنُونَ,"(Then after that) after the seven years of soil fertility (will come seven hard years) seven years of drought (which will devour all that ye have prepared for them) all that you have saved during the seven years of soil fertility, (save a little of that which ye have stored) kept aside."
ثُمَّ يَأْتِي مِن بَعْدِ ذٰلِكَ عَامٌ فِيهِ يُغَاثُ ٱلنَّاسُ وَفِيهِ يَعْصِرُونَ,"(Then, after that) after the years of drought, (will come a year when the people) of Egypt (will have plenteous crops) foodstuffs and rain (and when they will press) wine and oils."
وَقَالَ ٱلْمَلِكُ ٱئْتُونِي بِهِ فَلَمَّا جَآءَهُ ٱلرَّسُولُ قَالَ ٱرْجِعْ إِلَىٰ رَبِّكَ فَاسْأَلْهُ مَا بَالُ ٱلنِّسْوَةِ ٱللاَّتِي قَطَّعْنَ أَيْدِيَهُنَّ إِنَّ رَبِّي بِكَيْدِهِنَّ عَلِيمٌ,"The Messenger went back and informed the king of it. (And the King said: Bring him unto me) bring Joseph to me. (And when the messenger) the cupbearer (came unto him) to Joseph and informed him that the king wanted to see him, (he said) Joseph said to him: (Return unto thy lord) your master, the king (and ask him what was the case of the women) he said: go and ask the king to enquire about what really happened with those women (who cut their hands) who slashed and grazed their hands. (Lo! my lord) my master (knoweth their guile) their scheming and doing."
قَالَ مَا خَطْبُكُنَّ إِذْ رَاوَدتُّنَّ يُوسُفَ عَن نَّفْسِهِ قُلْنَ حَاشَ لِلَّهِ مَا عَلِمْنَا عَلَيْهِ مِن سُوۤءٍ قَالَتِ ٱمْرَأَتُ ٱلْعَزِيزِ ٱلآنَ حَصْحَصَ ٱلْحَقُّ أَنَاْ رَاوَدْتُّهُ عَن نَّفْسِهِ وَإِنَّهُ لَمِنَ ٱلصَّادِقِينَ,"The messenger went back and informed the king who summoned the four women: the wife of his cupbearer, the wife of his chief cook, the wife of the master of his stable and the wife of the Chief Official. These four women were the most powerful personalities after the king. (He (the king) (then sent for those women and) said: What happened when ye asked an evil act of Joseph? They answered: Allah Blameless!) God forbid! (We know) we saw (no evil of him. Said the wife of the ruler: Now the Truth is out) in favour of Joseph; it is also said that this means: now is the time to tell the truth. (I asked of him an evil act) I offered myself to him, (and he is surely of the Truthful) that he did not ask an evil act of me."
ذٰلِكَ لِيَعْلَمَ أَنِّي لَمْ أَخُنْهُ بِٱلْغَيْبِ وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ لاَ يَهْدِي كَيْدَ ٱلْخَائِنِينَ,"Joseph said: (This, that he) the Chief Official (may know that I betrayed him not) regarding his wife (in secret) when he was away, (and that surely Allah guideth not) neither is He pleased with nor make right (the snare of the betrayers) the work of adulterers."
وَمَآ أُبَرِّىءُ نَفْسِيۤ إِنَّ ٱلنَّفْسَ لأَمَّارَةٌ بِٱلسُّوۤءِ إِلاَّ مَا رَحِمَ رَبِّيۤ إِنَّ رَبِّي غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"At this point Gabriel said to him: “Not even when you nearly went to her, O Joseph?” Joseph said: (I do not exculpate myself) I do not exonerate my heart from nearly going towards her. (Lo! the (human) soul) the heart (enjoineth) the body (unto evil) evil works, (save that whereon my Lord hath mercy) save those whom Allah protects. (My Lord is Forgiving) He pardons, (Merciful) regarding the fact that I nearly went towards her."
وَقَالَ ٱلْمَلِكُ ٱئْتُونِي بِهِ أَسْتَخْلِصْهُ لِنَفْسِي فَلَمَّا كَلَّمَهُ قَالَ إِنَّكَ ٱلْيَوْمَ لَدَيْنَا مَكِينٌ أَمِينٌ,(And the king said: Bring him unto me that I may attach him to my person) bring him so that I give him a privileged position instead of the Chief Official. (And when he had talked with him) and interpreted his dreams (he said) the king said to him: (Lo! thou art today in our presence) with us (established) you have prestige and position (and trusted) with what is entrusted to you; it is also said: you are trusted with the position that we give you.
قَالَ ٱجْعَلْنِي عَلَىٰ خَزَآئِنِ ٱلأَرْضِ إِنِّي حَفِيظٌ عَلِيمٌ,"(He said: Set me over the storehouses of the land) appoint me in charge of the treasury of Egypt (I am a skilled custodian) I am skilled in its estimation and know the time when people go hungry; it is also said that this means: I am trustworthy regarding that with which you have entrusted me, and also know the languages of the strangers who come to you."
وَكَذٰلِكَ مَكَّنَّا لِيُوسُفَ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ يَتَبَوَّأُ مِنْهَا حَيْثُ يَشَآءُ نُصِيبُ بِرَحْمَتِنَا مَن نَشَآءُ وَلاَ نُضِيعُ أَجْرَ ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,(Thus gave We power to Joseph in the land) the land of Egypt. (He was the owner of it) who could go in this land (where be pleased. We reach with our mercy) with prophethood and Islam (whom We will) whoever deserves it. (We lose not) We thwart not (the reward of the good) the reward of the believers who do good in their deeds and speech.
وَلأَجْرُ ٱلآخِرَةِ خَيْرٌ لِّلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَكَانُواْ يَتَّقُونَ,"(And the reward of the Hereafter is better) than the reward of the life of this world, (for those who believe) in Allah and all the Scriptures and messengers (and ward off (evil)) ward off disbelief, idolatry and indecencies."
وَجَآءَ إِخْوَةُ يُوسُفَ فَدَخَلُواْ عَلَيْهِ فَعَرَفَهُمْ وَهُمْ لَهُ مُنكِرُونَ,"(And Joseph's brethren came) to Egypt: there were ten of them (and presented themselves before him) before Joseph, (and he knew them) Joseph knew that they were his brothers (but they knew him not) they did not know he was their brother."
وَلَمَّا جَهَّزَهُم بِجَهَازِهِمْ قَالَ ٱئْتُونِي بِأَخٍ لَّكُمْ مِّنْ أَبِيكُمْ أَلاَ تَرَوْنَ أَنِّيۤ أُوفِي ٱلْكَيْلَ وَأَنَاْ خَيْرُ ٱلْمُنْزِلِينَ,"(And when he provided them with their provision) when he measured for them the measure they were entitled to have (he said: Bring unto me a brother of yours from your father) for you said that you had a half brother, from your father's side, who stayed behind with your father. (See you not that I fill up the measure) it is said that he means: I fill up the measure with my own hands (and I am the best of hosts?)"
فَإِن لَّمْ تَأْتُونِي بِهِ فَلاَ كَيْلَ لَكُمْ عِندِي وَلاَ تَقْرَبُونِ,"(And if ye bring him not unto me) your half brother from your father's side, (then there shall be no measure for you with me) in the future, (nor shall ye draw near) again."
قَالُواْ سَنُرَاوِدُ عَنْهُ أَبَاهُ وَإِنَّا لَفَاعِلُونَ,(They said: We will try to win him from his father) we will ask his father and try to entice his father to let him come with us: (that we will surely do) we surely guarantee that we will bring him with us.
وَقَالَ لِفِتْيَانِهِ ٱجْعَلُواْ بِضَاعَتَهُمْ فِي رِحَالِهِمْ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَعْرِفُونَهَآ إِذَا ٱنْقَلَبُوۤاْ إِلَىٰ أَهْلِهِمْ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ,"(He) Joseph (said unto his young men) his servants: (Place their merchandise) hide their money (in their saddlebags so that they may know it) such that they know the favour I am bestowing upon them; it is also said that this means: such that they realise it is their money and bring it back to me, (when they go back to their folk) when they go back to their father, (and so will come again) a second time."
فَلَمَّا رَجَعُوا إِلَىٰ أَبِيهِمْ قَالُواْ يٰأَبَانَا مُنِعَ مِنَّا ٱلْكَيْلُ فَأَرْسِلْ مَعَنَآ أَخَانَا نَكْتَلْ وَإِنَّا لَهُ لَحَافِظُونَ,"(So when they went back to their father) in the land of Canaan (they said: O our father! The measure is denied us) in the future if you do not send Benjamin with us, (so send with us our brother) Benjamin (that we may obtain the measure) so that he can buy a measure for himself; or: that we may buy a measure for him, according to a different reading, (surely we will guard him well) we guarantee to bring him back to you."
قَالَ هَلْ آمَنُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ إِلاَّ كَمَآ أَمِنتُكُمْ عَلَىٰ أَخِيهِ مِن قَبْلُ فَٱللَّهُ خَيْرٌ حَافِظاً وَهُوَ أَرْحَمُ ٱلرَّاحِمِينَ,"(He said) Jacob said to them: (Can I entrust him) Benjamin (to you save as I entrusted his brother) Joseph (to you aforetime?) He said: can I really make you pledge and promise more than I did in the case of his brother Joseph (Allah is better at guarding) than you are, (and He is the Most Merciful of those who show mercy) and He is more Merciful towards him than his parents or brothers."
وَلَمَّا فَتَحُواْ مَتَاعَهُمْ وَجَدُواْ بِضَاعَتَهُمْ رُدَّتْ إِلَيْهِمْ قَالُواْ يٰأَبَانَا مَا نَبْغِي هَـٰذِهِ بِضَاعَتُنَا رُدَّتْ إِلَيْنَا وَنَمِيرُ أَهْلَنَا وَنَحْفَظُ أَخَانَا وَنَزْدَادُ كَيْلَ بَعِيرٍ ذٰلِكَ كَيْلٌ يَسِيرٌ,"(And when they opened their belongings) their saddlebags (they discovered that their merchandise) the money which was to pay for the merchandise they bought (had been returned to them) along with the foodstuffs. (They said: O our father!) We are not lying about the kindness and generosity of the man towards us; it is also said that this means: we have not requested this from him (What (more) can we ask? Here is our merchandise) the money we gave for the price of the merchandise (returned to us) with the merchandise. This only shows his kindness towards us. Their father said to them: the man is only testing you, you must return the money to him. (We shall get provision for our folk and guard our brother) Benjamin when we go and return, (and we shall have the extra measure of a camel (load)) if he comes with us. (This is a light measure) because of which we shall be given more; it is also said that this means: this is a small thing that we are requesting from you."
قَالَ لَنْ أُرْسِلَهُ مَعَكُمْ حَتَّىٰ تُؤْتُونِ مَوْثِقاً مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ لَتَأْتُنَّنِي بِهِ إِلاَّ أَن يُحَاطَ بِكُمْ فَلَمَّآ آتَوْهُ مَوْثِقَهُمْ قَالَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ مَا نَقُولُ وَكِيلٌ,"(He said) their father said to them: (I will not send him with you) simply because of your mere talk (till ye give me an undertaking) a pledge (in the name of Allah that you will bring him back to me, unless you are surrounded) unless an accident from heaven befalls you; it is also said that this means: unless an accident from heaven or from the earth descends upon you. (And when they gave him their undertaking) when they gave him their pledge in the name of Allah that they will bring him back (he said) Jacob said: (Allah is the Warden over what we say) Allah is a Witness over what we say; it is also said that this means: Allah is Custodian over what we say."
وَقَالَ يٰبَنِيَّ لاَ تَدْخُلُواْ مِن بَابٍ وَاحِدٍ وَٱدْخُلُواْ مِنْ أَبْوَابٍ مُّتَفَرِّقَةٍ وَمَآ أُغْنِي عَنكُمْ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ مِن شَيْءٍ إِنِ ٱلْحُكْمُ إِلاَّ للَّهِ عَلَيْهِ تَوَكَّلْتُ وَعَلَيْهِ فَلْيَتَوَكَّلِ ٱلْمُتَوَكِّلُونَ,"(And he said) to them: (O my sons! Go not in by one gate) do not go in through the same road; (go in by different gates) go in by different roads. (I can naught avail you as against Allah) against Allah's decree concerning you. (Lo! the decision) the judgement regarding what is decreed for you (rests with Allah only. In Him do I put my trust) I delegate my matter and yours to Him, (and in Him let all the trusting put their trust) those who rely should rely on Him; it is also said that this means: the believers should put their trust in Allah. Here, Jacob feared the evil eye against his sons, because they were all seemly and handsome."
وَلَمَّا دَخَلُواْ مِنْ حَيْثُ أَمَرَهُمْ أَبُوهُم مَّا كَانَ يُغْنِي عَنْهُمْ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ مِن شَيْءٍ إِلاَّ حَاجَةً فِي نَفْسِ يَعْقُوبَ قَضَاهَا وَإِنَّهُ لَذُو عِلْمٍ لِّمَا عَلَّمْنَاهُ وَلَـٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ ٱلنَّاسِ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ,"(And when they entered) Egypt (in the manner which their father had enjoined) as their father commanded them, (it would have naught availed them as against Allah) against what Allah had decreed for them; (it was but a need of Jacob's soul) in Jacob's heart (which he thus satisfied) which he expressed; (and lo! He) i.e. Jacob (was a lord of knowledge) of remembrance (because We had taught him) of that which We taught him of legal rulings, punishments, decree and destiny; he knew that nothing happens except what Allah decrees; (but most of mankind) the people of Egypt (know not) this nor believe in it."
وَلَمَّا دَخَلُواْ عَلَىٰ يُوسُفَ آوَىۤ إِلَيْهِ أَخَاهُ قَالَ إِنِّيۤ أَنَاْ أَخُوكَ فَلاَ تَبْتَئِسْ بِمَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ,"(And when they went in before Joseph, he took his brother) from both his father and mother (unto himself) he gave audience to his brother Benjamin and made his other brothers wait, (saying: Lo! I, even I, am your brother) in the position of your deceased brother, (therefore sorrow not) do not be saddened (for what they did) for the alienation, insults and vilification you face from your brothers."
فَلَمَّا جَهَّزَهُمْ بِجَهَازِهِمْ جَعَلَ ٱلسِّقَايَةَ فِي رَحْلِ أَخِيهِ ثُمَّ أَذَّنَ مُؤَذِّنٌ أَيَّتُهَا ٱلْعِيرُ إِنَّكُمْ لَسَارِقُونَ,"(And when he provided them with their provision) when he measured for them their provision, (he put the drinking cup in his brother's saddlebag) he hid his drinking cup which he also used for measurement in the saddlebag of his brother Benjamin. He then ordered them to leave and when they left he sent a youth after them, (and then a crier cried) the youth that Joseph sent cried: (O camel riders!) O people of the caravan (You are surely thieves!)"
قَالُواْ وَأَقْبَلُواْ عَلَيْهِمْ مَّاذَا تَفْقِدُونَ,"(They cried, coming towards them: What is it ye have lost?) what is it that you are looking for?"
قَالُواْ نَفْقِدُ صُوَاعَ ٱلْمَلِكِ وَلِمَن جَآءَ بِهِ حِمْلُ بَعِيرٍ وَأَنَاْ بِهِ زَعِيمٌ,"(They said: We have lost) we are looking for (the king's cup) in which he drinks and also uses for measurement. This cup is made of gold and I am being accused of stealing it, (and he who bringeth it shall have a camel load, and I (said Joseph) am answerable for it) I guarantee a camel load for him. All this was said by the youth whom Joseph had sent after his brothers."
قَالُواْ تَٱللَّهِ لَقَدْ عَلِمْتُمْ مَّا جِئْنَا لِنُفْسِدَ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَمَا كُنَّا سَارِقِينَ,"(They said: By Allah, well ye know) O people of Egypt (we came not to do evil in the land) the land of Egypt by stealing or harming people, (and are no thieves) we have not taken what you are looking for."
قَالُواْ فَمَا جَزَآؤُهُ إِن كُنتُمْ كَاذِبِينَ,(They said) Joseph's servant said: (And what shall be the penalty for it) what would be the penalty of the thief (if ye prove liars?)
قَالُواْ جَزَآؤُهُ مَن وُجِدَ فِي رَحْلِهِ فَهُوَ جَزَاؤُهُ كَذٰلِكَ نَجْزِي ٱلظَّالِمِينَ,"(They said: The penalty for it!) the penalty against (He in whose bag (the cup) is found, he is the penalty for it) is that he is to be taken as a slave. (Thus we requite wrong-doers) thus we punish the thieves in our land."
فَبَدَأَ بِأَوْعِيَتِهِمْ قَبْلَ وِعَآءِ أَخِيهِ ثُمَّ ٱسْتَخْرَجَهَا مِن وِعَآءِ أَخِيهِ كَذٰلِكَ كِدْنَا لِيُوسُفَ مَا كَانَ لِيَأْخُذَ أَخَاهُ فِي دِينِ ٱلْمَلِكِ إِلاَّ أَن يَشَآءَ ٱللَّهُ نَرْفَعُ دَرَجَاتٍ مَّن نَّشَآءُ وَفَوْقَ كُلِّ ذِي عِلْمٍ عَلِيمٌ,"(Then he) Joseph's servant (began the search with their bags before) searching (his brother's bag) where he obviously did not find it, (then he produced it from his brother's bag) from his brother Benjamin's bag. The servant said to him: “May Allah lift your trouble as you have lifted mine”. (Thus did We contrive) We did (for Joseph) We honoured him with knowledge, wisdom, prophethood and sovereignty. (He could not have taken his brother according to the king's law unless Allah willed) and Allah willed that he does take his brother according to the king's law because, according to the latter, the penalty for theft was beating and payment of a fine; it was also said that according to the king's law, the penalty for theft was the amputation of limbs and payment of a fine; it is also said that (unless Allah willed) means: except those laws of the king which Joseph knew to be pleasing to Allah, for he applied those. (We raise by grades (of mercy)) We raise the virtues of (whom We will) as We do in the life of this world, (and over every lord of knowledge there is one more knowing) above every one who knows there someone who knows more, and so on and so forth until one stops at Allah, for there is no one who has more knowledge than Him."
قَالُوۤاْ إِن يَسْرِقْ فَقَدْ سَرَقَ أَخٌ لَّهُ مِن قَبْلُ فَأَسَرَّهَا يُوسُفُ فِي نَفْسِهِ وَلَمْ يُبْدِهَا لَهُمْ قَالَ أَنْتُمْ شَرٌّ مَّكَاناً وَٱللَّهُ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا تَصِفُونَ,"(They said) the brothers of Joseph said: (If he stealeth) if Benjamin has stolen the king's cup, (a brother of his stole before) his full brother (Joseph) has stolen an idol before. (But Joseph kept it secret in his soul) he did not answer this (and revealed it not unto them) his response. (He said) within himself: (Ye are in worse case) your action is worse than that of Joseph (and Allah knoweth best (the Truth of) that which you allege) in relation to the matter of Joseph."
قَالُواْ يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلْعَزِيزُ إِنَّ لَهُ أَباً شَيْخاً كَبِيراً فَخُذْ أَحَدَنَا مَكَانَهُ إِنَّا نَرَاكَ مِنَ ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,"(They said: O ruler of the land! Lo! he hath an aged father) who will be very happy to have him back, (so take one of us instead of him. Lo! we behold thee) if you do so (of those who do kindness) for us."
قَالَ مَعَاذَ ٱللَّهِ أَن نَّأْخُذَ إِلاَّ مَن وَجَدْنَا مَتَاعَنَا عِندَهُ إِنَّـآ إِذاً لَّظَالِمُونَ,(He said) Joseph said to them: (Allah forbid that we should seize) for the crime of theft (save him with whom we found our property; then truly we should be wrong-doers) by arresting someone with whom we did not find our property.
فَلَمَّا ٱسْتَيْأَسُواْ مِنْهُ خَلَصُواْ نَجِيّاً قَالَ كَبِيرُهُمْ أَلَمْ تَعْلَمُوۤاْ أَنَّ أَبَاكُمْ قَدْ أَخَذَ عَلَيْكُمْ مَّوْثِقاً مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَمِن قَبْلُ مَا فَرَّطتُمْ فِي يُوسُفَ فَلَنْ أَبْرَحَ ٱلأَرْضَ حَتَّىٰ يَأْذَنَ لِيۤ أَبِيۤ أَوْ يَحْكُمَ ٱللَّهُ لِي وَهُوَ خَيْرُ ٱلْحَاكِمِينَ,"(So, when they despaired of (moving) him, they conferred together apart. The eldest of them) the best among them in reasoning: Judah (said: Know ye not) my brothers (how your father took an undertaking from you in Allah's name) that you will bring him back (and how you failed) in your pledge and covenant (in the case of Joseph aforetime) before this boy? (Therefore I shall not go forth from the land) of Egypt (until my father giveth leave) gives me leave to return; it is also said that this means: until my father gives me permission to fight them (or Allah judgeth for me) the return of my brother. (He is the Best of Judges) in relation to returning him to me."
ٱرْجِعُوۤاْ إِلَىٰ أَبِيكُمْ فَقُولُواْ يٰأَبَانَا إِنَّ ٱبْنَكَ سَرَقَ وَمَا شَهِدْنَآ إِلاَّ بِمَا عَلِمْنَا وَمَا كُنَّا لِلْغَيْبِ حَافِظِينَ,"Judah then said: (Return) O my brothers (unto your father and say: O our father! Lo! thy son hath stolen) the king's golden cup; it is also said that this means: your son was taken for stealing. (We testify only to that which we know) we saw the stolen cup found in his bag; (we are not guardians of the Unseen) he said: if we knew the unseen, we would not have taken him; it is also said that this means: we could not look after him at night."
وَسْئَلِ ٱلْقَرْيَةَ ٱلَّتِي كُنَّا فِيهَا وَٱلْعِيْرَ ٱلَّتِيۤ أَقْبَلْنَا فِيهَا وَإِنَّا لَصَادِقُونَ,"(Ask the township) the people of the township (where we were) it was one of the villages of Egypt, (and the caravan) and the people of the caravan (with which we travelled hither) they had travelled with a group of people from Canaan. (Lo! we speak the Truth) in that which we are saying to you. And so they told Jacob these words."
قَالَ بَلْ سَوَّلَتْ لَكُمْ أَنفُسُكُمْ أَمْراً فَصَبْرٌ جَمِيلٌ عَسَى ٱللَّهُ أَن يَأْتِيَنِي بِهِمْ جَمِيعاً إِنَّهُ هُوَ ٱلْعَلِيمُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ,"((And when they came unto their father and had spoken thus to him) he said) Jacob said to them: (Nay, but your minds have beguiled you into something) your minds have enticed you to do something, and so you did it. ((My course is) comely patience!) what I have to do is to be patient and show no anxiety. (It may be that Allah will bring them all) Joseph and his full brother as well as Judah (unto me. Lo! He, only He, is the Knower) of their whereabouts, (the Wise) in relation to returning them to me."
وَتَوَلَّىٰ عَنْهُمْ وَقَالَ يَٰأَسَفَىٰ عَلَى يُوسُفَ وَٱبْيَضَّتْ عَيْنَاهُ مِنَ ٱلْحُزْنِ فَهُوَ كَظِيمٌ,"(And he turned away from them) he left them (and said: Alas, my grief for Joseph! And his eyes were whitened with the sorrow) with tears (that he was suppressing) he kept his sorrow and grief within himself."
قَالُواْ تَاللهِ تَفْتَؤُاْ تَذْكُرُ يُوسُفَ حَتَّىٰ تَكُونَ حَرَضاً أَوْ تَكُونَ مِنَ ٱلْهَالِكِينَ,"(They said) i.e. his children and his grandchildren: (By Allah, thou wilt never cease remembering Joseph till your health is ruined or you art of those who perish) through death!"
قَالَ إِنَّمَآ أَشْكُو بَثِّي وَحُزْنِي إِلَى ٱللَّهِ وَأَعْلَمُ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ مَا لاَ تَعْلَمُونَ,"(He said) Jacob said: (I expose my distress and anguish only unto Allah, and I know from Allah that which ye know not) I know that Joseph's vision is true and that we will prostrate to him; it is also said that this means: I know of Allah's mercy and of His good work that which you do not; it is also said that this means: I know that Joseph is alive. That is because the angel of death came to him and he asked him: "" did you take away the soul of Joseph from among those you took their souls away "". And the angel said he did not."
يٰبَنِيَّ ٱذْهَبُواْ فَتَحَسَّسُواْ مِن يُوسُفَ وَأَخِيهِ وَلاَ تَيْأَسُواْ مِن رَّوْحِ ٱللَّهِ إِنَّهُ لاَ يَيْأَسُ مِن رَّوْحِ ٱللَّهِ إِلاَّ ٱلْقَوْمُ ٱلْكَافِرُونَ,"For this reason, he said: (Go, O my sons, and ascertain concerning Joseph and his brother) go and enquire about Joseph and his brother Benjamin, (and despair not of the Spirit of Allah) despair not of the mercy of Allah. (Lo! None despaireth of the Spirit of Allah) of the mercy of Allah (save disbelieving folk) save the people who disbelieve in Allah and His mercy."
فَلَمَّا دَخَلُواْ عَلَيْهِ قَالُواْ يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلْعَزِيزُ مَسَّنَا وَأَهْلَنَا ٱلضُّرُّ وَجِئْنَا بِبِضَاعَةٍ مُّزْجَاةٍ فَأَوْفِ لَنَا ٱلْكَيْلَ وَتَصَدَّقْ عَلَيْنَآ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَجْزِي ٱلْمُتَصَدِّقِينَ,"(And when they came (again) before him (Joseph)) a third time (they said: O ruler! Misfortune) hunger (hath touched us and our folk, and we bring but poor merchandise) merchandise which is not suitable for buying food, but are suitable for spending on people; it is also said that this means: merchandise that one can get in the mountains such as pine nuts and the fruit of the terebinth-tree; it is also said that this means: Arab merchandise such as dried lumps of cheese, wool, cheese and ghee, (so fill for us the measure) give us our measure as you would give if we had good money (and be charitable unto us) in regards to difference in the two prices; it is also said that this means: in regards to difference in the two measures. (Lo! Allah will requite the charitable) in the life of this world and in the Hereafter."
قَالَ هَلْ عَلِمْتُمْ مَّا فَعَلْتُم بِيُوسُفَ وَأَخِيهِ إِذْ أَنتُمْ جَاهِلُونَ,(He said) Joseph said to them: (Know ye what ye did unto Joseph and his brother in your ignorance) when you were ignorant youth?
قَالُوۤاْ أَءِنَّكَ لأَنتَ يُوسُفُ قَالَ أَنَاْ يُوسُفُ وَهَـٰذَا أَخِي قَدْ مَنَّ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْنَآ إِنَّهُ مَن يَتَّقِ وَيَصْبِرْ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لاَ يُضِيعُ أَجْرَ ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,(They said: Is it indeed thou who art Joseph? He said: I am Joseph and this is my brother) my full brother. (Allah hath shown us favour) by bestowing patience upon us. (Lo! he who wardeth off (evil)) in times of blessing (and endureth) in times of hardship finds favour; (for verily Allah loseth not) thwarts not (the wages) the reward (of the kindly) those who ward off evil and are patient.
قَالُواْ تَٱللَّهِ لَقَدْ آثَرَكَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْنَا وَإِن كُنَّا لَخَاطِئِينَ,"(They said) Joseph's brothers said to Joseph: (By Allah, verily Allah hath preferred you above us, and we were indeed sinful) towards you, and disobedient of Allah.."
قَالَ لاَ تَثْرِيبَ عَلَيْكُمُ ٱلْيَوْمَ يَغْفِرُ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمْ وَهُوَ أَرْحَمُ ٱلرَّاحِمِينَ,"(He said) Joseph said to them: (Have no fear this day!) he says: I will not reproach you today. (May Allah forgive you) for what you did, (and He is the Most Merciful of those who show mercy) He is more Merciful than one's own parents."
ٱذْهَبُواْ بِقَمِيصِي هَـٰذَا فَأَلْقُوهُ عَلَىٰ وَجْهِ أَبِي يَأْتِ بَصِيراً وَأْتُونِي بِأَهْلِكُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ,"(Go with this shirt of mine) and his shirt was from Paradise (and lay it on my father's face, he will become (again) a seer) he will regain his sight; (and come to me with all your folk) they were about seventy people."
وَلَمَّا فَصَلَتِ ٱلْعِيرُ قَالَ أَبُوهُمْ إِنِّي لأَجِدُ رِيحَ يُوسُفَ لَوْلاَ أَن تُفَنِّدُونِ,"(When the caravan departed) when the caravan left al-'Arish, a township between Egypt and Canaan, (their father) Jacob (had said: Truly I am conscious of the breath of Joseph, though ye call me dotard) unless you say I am foolish, discredit me or disbelieve in what I say."
قَالُواْ تَٱللَّهِ إِنَّكَ لَفِي ضَلاَلِكَ ٱلْقَدِيمِ,"((Those around him) said) those of his children who stayed with him and his grandchildren said: (By Allah, Lo! thou art in your old aberration) you are still in your old error concerning Joseph."
فَلَمَّآ أَن جَآءَ ٱلْبَشِيرُ أَلْقَاهُ عَلَىٰ وَجْهِهِ فَٱرْتَدَّ بَصِيراً قَالَ أَلَمْ أَقُلْ لَّكُمْ إِنِّيۤ أَعْلَمُ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ مَا لاَ تَعْلَمُونَ,"(Then, when the bearer of glad tidings came) i.e. Judah carrying the shirt, (he laid it on his face and he became a seer once more) he regained his sight. (He said) to his children and grandchildren: (Said I not unto you that I know from Allah that which ye know not?) did I not tell you that Joseph is still alive?"
قَالُواْ يٰأَبَانَا ٱسْتَغْفِرْ لَنَا ذُنُوبَنَآ إِنَّا كُنَّا خَاطِئِينَ,"(They said) his children and grandchildren said: (O our father! Ask forgiveness of our sins for us) ask Allah to forgive our sins, (for lo! we were sinful) we were wrong-doers and disobedient towards Allah."
قَالَ سَوْفَ أَسْتَغْفِرُ لَكُمْ رَبِّيۤ إِنَّهُ هُوَ ٱلْغَفُورُ ٱلرَّحِيمُ,"(He said) to them: (I shall ask forgiveness for you of my Lord) I will pray to Allah for you on the night of Friday, at the end of dawn. (He is the Forgiving, the Merciful) towards those who repent."
فَلَمَّا دَخَلُواْ عَلَىٰ يُوسُفَ آوَىٰ إِلَيْهِ أَبَوَيْهِ وَقَالَ ٱدْخُلُواْ مِصْرَ إِن شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ آمِنِينَ,"(And when they came in before Joseph, he took his parents unto him) he joined to him his father and stepmother, for his own mother was dead by then, (and said: Come into) dwell in (Egypt safe) from the enemies and from hunger, (if Allah will!) if Allah wills, you stay in Egypt safe from your enemies and hunger."
وَرَفَعَ أَبَوَيْهِ عَلَى ٱلْعَرْشِ وَخَرُّواْ لَهُ سُجَّدَاً وَقَالَ يٰأَبَتِ هَـٰذَا تَأْوِيلُ رُؤْيَايَ مِن قَبْلُ قَدْ جَعَلَهَا رَبِّي حَقّاً وَقَدْ أَحْسَنَ بَيۤ إِذْ أَخْرَجَنِي مِنَ ٱلسِّجْنِ وَجَآءَ بِكُمْ مِّنَ ٱلْبَدْوِ مِن بَعْدِ أَن نَّزغَ ٱلشَّيْطَانُ بَيْنِي وَبَيْنَ إِخْوَتِيۤ إِنَّ رَبِّي لَطِيفٌ لِّمَا يَشَآءُ إِنَّهُ هُوَ ٱلْعَلِيمُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ,"(And he placed his parents on the dais) on an elevated platform (and they fell down before him prostrate) i.e. his parents and brothers fell prostrate before him. This prostration was a sign of greeting between them: the person of humble standing prostrated to the person of high standing, the youth to the elderly and the young to the old; it is a slight bowing as is known among non-Arabs, (and he said: O my father! This) prostration (is the interpretation of my dream of old. My Lord hath made it true, and He hath shown me kindness, since He took me out of the prison) and saved me from slavery (and hath brought you from the desert after Satan had made strife between me and my brethren) through resentful envy. (Lo! my Lord is tender unto whom He will) my Lord is tender in that He brought us together. (He is the Knower) of that which has befallen us, (the Wise) in separating and then bringing us together."
رَبِّ قَدْ آتَيْتَنِي مِنَ ٱلْمُلْكِ وَعَلَّمْتَنِي مِن تَأْوِيلِ ٱلأَحَادِيثِ فَاطِرَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ أَنتَ وَلِيِّي فِي ٱلدُّنُيَا وَٱلآخِرَةِ تَوَفَّنِى مُسْلِماً وَأَلْحِقْنِي بِٱلصَّالِحِينَ,"(O my Lord! Thou hast given me (something) of sovereignty) you gave me the sovereignty of Egypt which spreads over an area of forty parasangs by forty parasangs (and hast taught me (something) of the interpretation of events) the interpretation of dreams, (Creator of the heavens and the earth! Thou art my Protecting Friend) You are Lord, Creator, Provider, Protector and Helper (in the world and the Hereafter. Make me to die submissive (unto Thee)) in my worship and confession of monotheism, (and join me to the righteous) join me in Paradise with the messengers among my forefathers."
ذَلِكَ مِنْ أَنْبَآءِ ٱلْغَيْبِ نُوحِيهِ إِلَيْكَ وَمَا كُنتَ لَدَيْهِمْ إِذْ أَجْمَعُوۤاْ أَمْرَهُمْ وَهُمْ يَمْكُرُونَ,"(This) that which I mentioned to you, O Muhammad, of the story of Joseph and his brothers (is of the tidings of the Unseen) of the events which were hidden from you (which We inspire in thee (Muhammad)) with which We send Gabriel to you. (Thou wast not present with them when they bed their plan) when they agreed to throw Joseph in the well (and they were scheming) they were intending by this the peril of Joseph."
وَمَآ أَكْثَرُ ٱلنَّاسِ وَلَوْ حَرَصْتَ بِمُؤْمِنِينَ,"(And though thou try much) no matter how hard you try, (most men) the people of Mecca (will not believe) in the scriptures and messengers."

وَكَأَيِّن مِّن آيَةٍ فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ يَمُرُّونَ عَلَيْهَا وَهُمْ عَنْهَا مُعْرِضُونَ,"(How many a portent) a sign (is there in the heavens) such as the sun, the moon, the stars, etc., (and the earth) and that which is in the earth such as mountains, oceans, trees, beasts, etc., (which they) i.e. the people of Mecca (pass by with face averted!) they denied them and never reflected upon them."

(And verily the abode of the Hereafter) Paradise, (for those who ward off (evil)) ward off disbelief, idolatry and indecencies and instead believe in Allah, Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an, (is best. Have ye then no sense?) do you not have the common sense to realise that the Hereafter is better than the life of this world; it is also said that this means: have you then no sense to realise that the life of this world is evanescent while the Hereafter is everlasting; it is also said that this means: do you not believe in that which befell the people of old as a result of their disbelief in the messengers?"
حَتَّىٰ إِذَا ٱسْتَيْأَسَ ٱلرُّسُلُ وَظَنُّوۤاْ أَنَّهُمْ قَدْ كُذِبُواْ جَآءَهُمْ نَصْرُنَا فَنُجِّيَ مَن نَّشَآءُ وَلاَ يُرَدُّ بَأْسُنَا عَنِ ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلْمُجْرِمِينَ,"(Till, when the messengers despaired) they despaired in the belief of their people (and thought) and knew and were certain, i.e. the messengers (that they) their people (were denied) the promise of the messengers; it is also said that this means: the people denied that which the messengers brought to them from Allah, (then came unto them Our help) i.e. Our chastisement, destroying their people, (and whom We would was saved) i.e. the messengers and those who believed in them.

(It is no invented story) the Qur'an is not an invented story (but a confirmation of the existing (Scripture)) a confirmation of the Torah, the Gospel and all the others scriptures; it confirms the profession of monotheism and other legal rulings as well as the story of Joseph (and a detailed explanation of everything) a detailed explanation of the lawful and the unlawful, (and a guidance) from error (and a mercy) preventing from chastisement (for folk who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an which was revealed to you from your Lord, and Allah knows the secrets of His Book'."

He says: and of that which you cast in the fire of gold and silver contains adulteration just as the foam of the sea does have salt (in order to make ornaments) which you were. Allah says here: the Truth is like gold and silver which benefit people, and falsehood is like the impurities which are derived from the casting of gold and silver, which are of no benefit. Likewise falsehood benefits no one (and tools) ore and copper (riseth a foam like unto it) He says: these also have impurities, i.e. just as the foam of the sea. This is another simile. He says: the Truth is like ore and copper from which people benefit, just as people benefit from the Truth. And falsehood is like the impurities resulting from the casting of ore and copper, which are of no benefit, just as falsehood is of no benefit to anyone, (thus Allah coineth (the similitude of)) thus Allah explains (the true and the false. Then, as for the foam, it passeth away as scum upon the banks) it goes just as it comes: it is of no benefit to its owner, (while, as for that which is of use to mankind) pure water, gold, silver, ore and copper, (it remaineth in the earth) it is useful just as the Truth is.

(Nay, but their contrivance) their speech and deeds (is made seeming fair for those who disbelieve) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an (and they are kept from the right road) they were sent astray from Religion. (He whom Allah sendeth astray) from His religion, (for him there is no guide) no one to give him success."
لَّهُمْ عَذَابٌ فِي ٱلْحَيَاةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَلَعَذَابُ ٱلآخِرَةِ أَشَقُّ وَمَا لَهُم مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ مِن وَاقٍ,"(For them is torment in the life of the world) by being killed in Badr, (and verily the doom of the Hereafter is more painful) than the torment of the life of this world, (and they have no defender) no one to save them from this torment nor any refuge (from Allah) from Allah's torment."

(And of the clans) i.e. the Jews (there are who deny some of it) some of the Qur'an, except the surah of Joseph and the portions of it in which the All-Merciful is mentioned; it is also said that the clans her refers to the Confederates, i.e. the disbelievers of Mecca as well as other disbelievers, who deny some of the Qur'an in which the All-Merciful is mentioned. (Say) O Muhammad: (I am commanded only that I serve Allah) in all sincerity (and ascribe unto Him no partner. Unto Him I cry) I call people unto Him, (and unto Him is my return) my return in the Hereafter."

This verse was revealed about the Jews because they said: Had Muhammad been a prophet, he would have been too preoccupied to get married, (and it was not (given) to any messenger that he should bring a portent) a sign (save by Allah's leave) save by Allah's command. (For everything there is a time prescribed) an appointed time."

((When) Allah doometh) when He decrees the conquest of cities or the death of scholars (there is none that can postpone) there is nothing that can change this. (His doom, and He is swift at reckoning) His torment is severe; it is also said that this means: when He takes people to task, His reckoning is severe."

(He) Allah (knows that which each soul) whether believing or unbelieving (earneth) of good or evil. (The disbelievers) the Jews and all the disbelievers (will come to know for whom will be the sequel of the (heavenly) Home) i.e. Paradise; it is also said that this means: the disbelievers will come to know for whom is the upper hand on the Day of Badr and to whom Mecca will belong."

Allah therefore said: (Say: Allah, and whosoever hath true knowledge of the Scripture) i.e. 'Abdullah Ibn Salam and his companions; it is also said that the reference here is to Asaf Ibn Barkhiyya, due to Allah's saying: (One with whom was knowledge of the Scripture) [27: 40]-and it is also said that this means: the one who has knowledge of the Scripture can explain the Qur'an-(is sufficient witness between me and you) that I am His Messenger and this Qur'an is His speech'."

Lam. Ra.): '(Alif. Lam. Ra.) He says: I am Allah: I see what you say and do; it is also said that it is an oath by which Allah swore. ((This is) a Scripture which We have revealed unto thee (Muhammad)) with which We have sent Gabriel to you (that thereby thou mayst bring forth mankind) that you may call the people of Mecca (from darkness unto light) to leave disbelieve and accept faith, (by the permission of their Lord) you call them by the command of their Lord, (unto the path) to Religion (of the Mighty) in His retribution against those who do not believe, (the Owner of Praise) in the eyes of him who professes His divine Oneness; it is also said that this means: the Praised One in His acts."

(And remind them of the days of Allah) of the days when Allah sent His chastisement; it is also said that this means: remind them of the days of Allah's mercy. (Lo! Therein) in what I have mentioned (are revelations) signs (for each steadfast) in obedience, (thankful (heart)) for the blessings bestowed upon him."

(None save Allah knoweth them) none knows their numbers or their punishment save Allah. (Their messengers came unto them with clear proofs) they came to them with commands, prohibitions and signs, (but they thrust their hands into their mouths) He says: they rejected what the messengers brought to them; it is also said that this means: they thrust their hands into their mouths, as if saying: be quiet or we will silence you, (and said) to the messengers: (Lo! we disbelieve) we reject (in that wherewith ye have been sent) of Scripture and monotheism, (and lo! we are in grave doubt) in manifest doubt (concerning that to which ye call us) of Scripture and monotheism."

(They said) to the messengers: (Ye are but mortals) human beings (like us, who would fain turn us away from what our fathers used to worship) of idols. (Then bring some clear warrant) an edict or proof."

(It is not ours) it behoves us not (to bring you a warrant) a decree or proof (unless by the permission of Allah) by the command of Allah. (In Allah let believers put their trust!) He says: the believers should rely on Allah."

The messengers said: (How should we not put our trust in Allah when He hath shown us our ways) when He favoured us with prophethood and complete surrender to Him? (We surely will endure that hurt ye do us) we will endure your physical harm through obedience of Allah. (In Allah let the trusting put their trust!) let them rely on Allah.

(That is the extreme failure) the error which is far remote from the Truth or guidance."
أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ خَلَقَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضَ بِٱلْحقِّ إِن يَشَأْ يُذْهِبْكُمْ وَيَأْتِ بِخَلْقٍ جَدِيدٍ,"(Hast thou not seen) have you not been informed, O Muhammad; Allah addressed His Prophet, but it is his people who are meant by this address: (that Allah hath created the heavens and the earth with truth) to explain the Truth and falsehood; it is also said that this means: He created them for evanescence and extinction? (If He will, He can remove you) He can destroy you, or make you die, O people of Mecca, (and bring (in) some new creation) and will create other beings who are better than you and more obedient to Allah."
وَمَا ذٰلِكَ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ بِعَزِيزٍ,(And that is no great matter for Allah) that is not very difficult for Allah; He says: it is not very difficult for Allah to destroy you and create different beings.

(I cannot help you) save you from the chastisement of hell, (nor can ye help me) nor can you save me from entering hell. (Lo! I disbelieved in that which ye before) before you associated it with me; it is also said that this means: I disbelieve today in that which you associate with me; he says: I disassociate myself from you and from your religion and from your response to me before this, i.e. in the worldly life (ascribed to me) you associated with me. (Lo! For wrong-doers) for the disbelievers (is a painful doom) a severe torment that will extend to their hearts."

أَلَمْ تَرَ كَيْفَ ضَرَبَ ٱللَّهُ مَثَلاً كَلِمَةً طَيِّبَةً كَشَجَرةٍ طَيِّبَةٍ أَصْلُهَا ثَابِتٌ وَفَرْعُهَا فِي ٱلسَّمَآءِ,"(Seest thou you not) have you not been informed, O Muhammad, (how Allah coineth a similitude: A goodly saying) He says: how Allah has exposited the description of a goodly saying which is "" there is no god save Allah "" , (as a goodly tree) which is the believer, (its root set firm) He says: the heart of the sincere believer is firm by means of "" there is no god save Allah "" , (its branches reaching into heaven) He says: due to it the works of a sincere believer are accepted,"
تُؤْتِيۤ أُكُلَهَا كُلَّ حِينٍ بِإِذْنِ رَبِّهَا وَيَضْرِبُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلأَمْثَالَ لِلنَّاسِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَذَكَّرُونَ,"(Giving its fruit at every season) He says: the sincere believer performs goodness and acts of obedience to Allah at all times (by permission of its Lord?) He says: by command of its Lord; it is also said: the trait of a goodly saying insofar as its benefit and praise are concerned is like a goodly tree-the palm-tree-whose fruits are goodly. And the same goes for the believer. He says: the origin of the tree is firmly grounded in the soil by means of its roots, and so is the believer: he is firm by means of proof and argument. (Its branches reaching into heaven) He says: the branches of the palm-trees are raised towards the sky, and so are the works of the believer raised to heaven. (Giving its fruit at every season) He says: it yields fruits every six months by the will of its Lord, and so is the believer, he performs acts of goodness or obedience at all times. (Allah coineth the similitudes) thus Allah explains His divine Oneness by coining similes (for mankind in order that they may reflect) so that people may take heed and desire to profess His divine Oneness."
وَمَثلُ كَلِمَةٍ خَبِيثَةٍ كَشَجَرَةٍ خَبِيثَةٍ ٱجْتُثَّتْ مِن فَوْقِ ٱلأَرْضِ مَا لَهَا مِن قَرَارٍ,"(And the similitude of a bad saying) associating partners with Allah (is as a bad tree) this refers to the idolater. He says: idolatry is blameworthy and no aspect of it is praiseworthy, just as the idolater is censored and there is nothing praiseworthy about him; it is also said that the bad tree refers to the colocynth which is bitter and useless, and so is the idolater: useless and censored, (uprooted from upon the earth, possessing no stability) it has no firmness on the face of the earth; and so is the idolater: he does not have any proof to cling to, just as the colocynth does not have roots which keep it firmly grounded. Moreover, while a person is an idolater none of his works are accepted."
يُثَبِّتُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ بِٱلْقَوْلِ ٱلثَّابِتِ فِي ٱلْحَيَاةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَفِي ٱلآخِرَةِ وَيُضِلُّ ٱللَّهُ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ وَيَفْعَلُ ٱللَّهُ مَا يَشَآءُ,"(Allah confirmeth those who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an; it is also said that this means: those who believed were on the day of the Covenant with a good disposition of the soul, and these are the felicitous people, (by a firm saying) the testification that there is no god but Allah (in the life of the world) so that they do not go back on it (and in the Hereafter) i.e. in the grave when asked about it, (and Allah sendeth wrong-doers) the idolaters (astray) from the testification of there is no god but Allah in the life of this world, so that they do not say it with a good disposition of the soul, nor in the grave nor when they come out of it. These are the people destined for damnation. (And Allah doeth what He will) whether it is sending astray or holding people firm; it is also said: (And Allah doeth what He will) about turning away Munkar and Nakir."
أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى ٱلَّذِينَ بَدَّلُواْ نِعْمَتَ ٱللَّهِ كُفْراً وَأَحَلُّواْ قَوْمَهُمْ دَارَ ٱلْبَوَارِ,"(Hast thou not seen) have you not been informed, O Muhammad, about (those who gave the grace of Allah in exchange) they changed the gift of Allah who bestowed upon them the Scripture and the messengers and instead opted (for thanklessness) disbelief in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an. These are the Banu Umayyah and the Banu'l-Mughirah who fed the army of the unbelievers on the Day of Badr, (and led their people down to) they let the people of Mecca camp at (the Abode of Loss) the abode of destruction, i.e. the place of Badr; it is also said that the Abode of Loss refers to Gehenna,"
جَهَنَّمَ يَصْلَوْنَهَا وَبِئْسَ ٱلْقَرَارُ,Allah then said: ((Even to) hell? They are exposed thereto) they will enter it on the Day of Judgement. (A hapless end!) their abode and destination is Gehenna.
وَجَعَلُواْ لِلَّهِ أَندَاداً لِّيُضِلُّواْ عَن سَبِيلِهِ قُلْ تَمَتَّعُواْ فَإِنَّ مَصِيرَكُمْ إِلَى ٱلنَّارِ,"(And they set up rivals to Allah) they ascribed to Allah co-equals from among idols which they worshipped (that they may mislead (men) from His way) from His religion and obedience. (Say) O Muhammad, to the people of Mecca: (Enjoy life (while ye may)) in your state of disbelief (for lo! your journey's end will be the Fire) on the Day of Judgement."
قُل لِّعِبَادِيَ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ يُقِيمُواْ ٱلصَّلاَةَ وَيُنْفِقُواْ مِمَّا رَزَقْنَاهُمْ سِرّاً وَعَلانِيَةً مِّن قَبْلِ أَن يَأْتِيَ يَوْمٌ لاَّ بَيْعٌ فِيهِ وَلاَ خِلاَلٌ,"(Tell) O Muhammad (My bondmen who believe) in Me and in My Scripture and messengers (to establish worship) the five daily prayers, complete with their ritual ablution, bowings, prostrations and that which is obligated in them in their prescribed times (and spend of that which We have given them) and give alms, (secretly and publicly) these are the Companions of Muhammad (pbuh) (before a day comes) this is the Day of Judgement (wherein there will be neither traffic) ransom (nor befriending) for the disbeliever, while the believer will benefit from his friendships."
ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِي خَلَقَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضَ وَأَنزَلَ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مَآءً فَأَخْرَجَ بِهِ مِنَ ٱلثَّمَرَاتِ رِزْقاً لَّكُمْ وَسَخَّرَ لَكُمُ ٱلْفُلْكَ لِتَجْرِيَ فِي ٱلْبَحْرِ بِأَمْرِهِ وَسَخَّرَ لَكُمُ ٱلأَنْهَارَ,"Allah then declared His divine Oneness, saying: (Allah is He Who created the heavens and the earth, and causeth water) rain (to descend from the sky, thereby producing) the rain brought forth (fruits) different kinds of fruit (as food for you) and for all other created beings, (and maketh the ships to be of service) subservient (unto you, that they) i.e. the ships (may run upon the sea at His command) by His permission and will, (and hath made of service) subservient (unto you the rivers) they flow wherever you want;"
وَسَخَّر لَكُمُ ٱلشَّمْسَ وَٱلْقَمَرَ دَآئِبَينَ وَسَخَّرَ لَكُمُ ٱلَّيلَ وَٱلنَّهَارَ,"(And maketh the sun and the moon, constant in their courses) until the Day of Judgement, (to be of service unto you) subservient to you, (and hath made of service) and made subservient (unto you the night and the day) which come and go."
وَآتَاكُم مِّن كُلِّ مَا سَأَلْتُمُوهُ وَإِن تَعُدُّواْ نِعْمَتَ ٱللَّهِ لاَ تُحْصُوهَا إِنَّ ٱلإنْسَانَ لَظَلُومٌ كَفَّارٌ,"(And He giveth you of all ye ask of Him) as well as that which you do not know even how to ask for, (and if ye would count the bounty of Allah) the blessings of Allah (ye cannot reckon it) you would not be able to remember them or give thanks for them. (Lo! Man) i.e. the disbeliever (is verily a wrong-doer) he associates others with Allah, (an ingrate) He disbelieves in Allah and in His blessings."
وَإِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ رَبِّ ٱجْعَلْ هَـٰذَا ٱلْبَلَدَ ءَامِناً وَٱجْنُبْنِي وَبَنِيَّ أَن نَّعْبُدَ ٱلأَصْنَامَ,"(And when Abraham said) after the building of the House: (My Lord!) O my Lord! (Make safe) such that no turmoil takes place and whoever is in fear finds safety in (this territory) Mecca, (and preserve me and my sons from serving idols) from worshipping idols or fire."
رَبِّ إِنَّهُنَّ أَضْلَلْنَ كَثِيراً مِّنَ ٱلنَّاسِ فَمَن تَبِعَنِي فَإِنَّهُ مِنِّي وَمَنْ عَصَانِي فَإِنَّكَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"And preserve me (My Lord!) O my Lord! (Lo! they have led many of mankind astray) i.e. they were made to lead many people astray; it is also said that this means: many people went astray because of them. (But whoso followeth me) whoever follows my religion and obeys me, (he verily is of me) he follows my religion. (And whoso disobeyeth me) whoever opposes my religion, (still Thou art Forgiving) of whoever repent of among them, (Merciful) towards whoever dies repentant."

Thou knowest that which we hide) of the love of Ishmael (and that which we proclaim) of the love of Isaac; it is also said that this means: You know that which we hide of the love of Ishmael and what we proclaim of aloofness towards him. (Nothing in the earth or in the heaven is hidden from Allah) whether it is a good or evil work.
ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ ٱلَّذِي وَهَبَ لِي عَلَى ٱلْكِبَرِ إِسْمَاعِيلَ وَإِسْحَاقَ إِنَّ رَبِّي لَسَمِيعُ ٱلدُّعَآءِ,"(Praise be to Allah) Thanks to Allah (Who hath given me, in my old age, Ishmael and Isaac!) he was then 100 years old and his wife Sarah was 99 years old.

(Forgive me) my sins (and my parents) and forgive my believing forefathers (and believers) and forgive all believing men and women (on the day when the account is cast) when there is reckoning and both the good and evil deeds are displayed, such as those whose good deeds outweigh their evil deeds will enter Paradise and those whose evil works outweigh their good deeds will enter hell; while those whose good works equal their evil works will be among the people of the Heights."
وَلاَ تَحْسَبَنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَافِلاً عَمَّا يَعْمَلُ ٱلظَّالِمُونَ إِنَّمَا يُؤَخِّرُهُمْ لِيَوْمٍ تَشْخَصُ فِيهِ ٱلأَبْصَارُ,(Deem not that Allah is unaware of what the wicked do) do not think that Allah will not punish the idolaters for what they do. (He but gives them a respite till a day when eyes will stare (in terror)) the eyes of the disbelievers will stare in terror on the Day of Judgement.
مُهْطِعِينَ مُقْنِعِي رُءُوسِهِمْ لاَ يَرْتَدُّ إِلَيْهِمْ طَرْفُهُمْ وَأَفْئِدَتُهُمْ هَوَآءٌ,"(As they come hurrying on in fear) looking to the caller, (their heads upraised) stretching their necks; it is also said that this means: lowering down their heads, (their gaze returning not to them) out of fear and terror, (and their hearts as air) empty from all goodness; it is also said: neither coming out nor going back in."
وَأَنذِرِ ٱلنَّاسَ يَوْمَ يَأْتِيهِمُ ٱلْعَذَابُ فَيَقُولُ ٱلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوۤاْ رَبَّنَآ أَخِّرْنَآ إِلَىٰ أَجَلٍ قَرِيبٍ نُّجِبْ دَعْوَتَكَ وَنَتَّبِعِ ٱلرُّسُلَ أَوَلَمْ تَكُونُوۤاْ أَقْسَمْتُمْ مِّن قَبْلُ مَا لَكُمْ مِّن زَوَالٍ,"(And warn mankind) warn the people of Mecca by means of the Qur'an (of a day) the Day of Badr; it is also said that this is a reference to the Day of Judgement (when the doom will come upon them, and those who did wrong) the idolaters (will say: Our Lord!) O our Lord! (Reprieve us for a little while) in the life of this world. (We will obey Your call) to monotheism (and will follow the messengers) we will obey the messengers. Allah will then say to them: (Did ye not swear before) before this, when you were in the life of the lower world (that there would be no end for you) in the life of the world and that there is no resurrection?"
وَسَكَنتُمْ فِي مَسَـٰكِنِ ٱلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوۤاْ أَنفُسَهُمْ وَتَبَيَّنَ لَكُمْ كَيْفَ فَعَلْنَا بِهِمْ وَضَرَبْنَا لَكُمُ ٱلأَمْثَالَ,"(And (have ye not) dwelt in the dwellings of those who wronged themselves (of old)) through idolatry and denial without take heed from their destruction (and (hath it not) become plain to you how We dealt with them) in this worldly life, (and made) struck (examples for you) in the Qur'an of all sorts: of promises, of threats, of mercy and of chastisement?"
وَقَدْ مَكَرُواْ مَكْرَهُمْ وَعِندَ ٱللَّهِ مَكْرُهُمْ وَإِن كَانَ مَكْرُهُمْ لِتَزُولَ مِنْهُ ٱلْجِبَالُ,"(Verily they have plotted their plot) they did their deed through their denial of the messengers, (and their plot is with Allah) the punishment of their deed is with Allah, (though their plot were one whereby the mountains should be moved) whereby the mountains should crumble; it is also said that this means: the plotting of Nimrod was such that the mountains would have crumbled, for the sounds of the Ark and eagles were heard."
فَلاَ تَحْسَبَنَّ ٱللَّهَ مُخْلِفَ وَعْدِهِ رُسُلَهُ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ ذُو ٱنْتِقَامٍ,"(So think not that Allah will fail to keep His promise to His messengers) that He will help and destroy their enemies.

يَوْمَ تُبَدَّلُ ٱلأَرْضُ غَيْرَ ٱلأَرْضِ وَٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتُ وَبَرَزُواْ لِلَّهِ ٱلْوَاحِدِ الْقَهَّارِ,"(On the day when the earth will be changed to other than the earth) it will be changed to a state other than the actual state. Its changing will take place by adding to and subtracting from it, and its valleys and mountains will be levelled down; and it is also said that this means: the earth will be changed to other than what it is now, (and the heavens (also will be changed)) they will be folded up in His right Hand (and they will come forth unto Allah) they emerge and become manifest to (the One, the Almighty) Who conquers His created being by means of death."

الۤرَ تِلْكَ آيَاتُ ٱلْكِتَابِ وَقُرْآنٍ مُّبِينٍ,"And from his chain of transmitters on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said in explanation of Allah's saying (Alif. Lam. Ra.): '(Alif. Lam. Ra.) He says: I am Allah, and I see; it is also said that this is an oath, Allah swore by the Alif and by the Lam and by the Ra. (These are verses of the Scripture) this surah consists of verses from the Scripture (and a plain Reading) He says: I swear by the Qur'an which makes plain the lawful and the prohibited, the commands and prohibitions."
رُّبَمَا يَوَدُّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لَوْ كَانُواْ مُسْلِمِينَ,"(It may be that those who disbelieve) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an (wish ardently that they were Muslims) in this worldly life. He says: there may come a day when the disbeliever would wish that he was a Muslim. This is because when Allah takes out of hell whoever was a sincere believer and enters them into Paradise, the disbeliever wishes at that moment he had been a Muslim in this worldly life."
ذَرْهُمْ يَأْكُلُواْ وَيَتَمَتَّعُواْ وَيُلْهِهِمُ ٱلأَمَلُ فَسَوْفَ يَعْلَمُونَ,"(Let them) O Muhammad (eat) without having any proof or resolve for that which lies ahead (and enjoy life) and live a life of disbelief and illicitness, (and let (false) hope beguile them) and let long hope preoccupy them from obeying Allah.

So forgive, O Muhammad, with a gracious forgiveness) turn away from them gently without using foul language nor feel alarmed at their denial. This was, however, abrogated by the verse of fighting."
إِنَّ رَبَّكَ هُوَ ٱلْخَلاَّقُ ٱلْعَلِيمُ,"(Lo! thy Lord! He is the All-Wise Creator) Who will resurrect those who believe in Him and those who do not believe in Him, and He also knows their reward and punishment."

وَقُلْ إِنِّيۤ أَنَا ٱلنَّذِيرُ ٱلْمُبِينُ,"(And say: Lo! I, even I, am a plain warner) I am a messenger warning you against Allah's chastisement, in a language that you all understand,"

ٱلَّذِينَ جَعَلُواْ ٱلْقُرْآنَ عِضِينَ,"(Those who break the Qur'an into parts) they said many different things about the Qur'an; some said it was magic, others said it was poetry, others said it was a form of divination; some said it was fables of the people of old while others said that it was mere lies invented by the Prophet."
فَوَرَبِّكَ لَنَسْأَلَنَّهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ,"(Them, by thy Lord) O Muhammad; Allah here swore by Himself, (We shall question) on the Day of Judgement, (every one),"
عَمَّا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ,(Of what they used to do) and say in this worldly life; it is also said that this means: they will be questioned about their abstention from the profession of “there is no god but Allah”.
فَٱصْدَعْ بِمَا تُؤْمَرُ وَأَعْرِضْ عَنِ ٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ,"(So proclaim that which thou art commanded) He says: reveal your matter in Mecca, (and withdraw from the idolaters)."

(But they will come to know) what will be done with them. Allah destroyed, in the span of one night and one day, each one of them by means of a different torment. These were five in number, among them was al-'As Ibn Wa'il al-Sahmi who was stung by something and died on the spot, may Allah keep him far from His mercy. And among them was al-Harth Ibn Qays al-Sahmi who ate salted fish which made him very thirsty. He drank so much water that his stomach burst open and he died, may Allah ruin him. And among them was al-Aswad Ibn 'Abd al-Muttalib whose head Gabriel banged on a tree and then hit his face with thorns until he died, may Allah curse him. And among them is al-Aswad Ibn 'Abd Yaghuth who left his house in an extremely hot day and was caught by the simoom such that his colour turned black and resembled an Abyssinian. He went back to his house, but they refused to open the door for him. He banged the door with his head so hard that he died, may Allah forsake him. And among them was al-Walid Ibn al-Mughirah al-Makhzumi who died as a result of an arrow which grazed his anklebone, may Allah banish him. All these people used to say before they died: “the Lord of Muhammad (pbuh) has killed me”."
وَلَقَدْ نَعْلَمُ أَنَّكَ يَضِيقُ صَدْرُكَ بِمَا يَقُولُونَ,"(Well know We that thy bosom) O Muhammad (is at times oppressed by what they say) in their denial of you, and that you are a poet, a magician, a liar and a diviner,"
فَسَبِّحْ بِحَمْدِ رَبِّكَ وَكُنْ مِّنَ ٱلسَّاجِدِينَ,"(But hymn the praise of thy Lord) pray by the command of your Lord, (and be of those who make prostration (unto Him)) of those who prostrate to Him; it is also said that this means: of those who are obedient to Him."

أَتَىٰ أَمْرُ ٱللَّهِ فَلاَ تَسْتَعْجِلُوهُ سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَىٰ عَمَّا يُشْرِكُونَ,"And from his chain of transmitters on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said: 'When the words of Allah (The reckoning draws near for mankind…) [21:1] and (The hour drew near…) [54:1], people waited whatever time Allah willed them to wait, but nothing happened. So they said: “O Muhammad! When will the torment which you promised us happen?” As a response, Allah revealed: (The commandment of Allah will come to pass) the chastisement of Allah has come. The Prophet (pbuh) was sitting at that point and he suddenly stood, having no doubt in his mind that the chastisement had come. But immediately after that, Allah said: (so seek not ye to hasten it) i.e. the chastisement, at which the Prophet (pbuh) sat down. (Glorified) Allah exonerated Himself from having a son or partner (and Exalted be He) He is too elevated and absolves Himself (above all that they associate (with Him)) of idols."

(High be He exalted) He exonerates Himself (above all that they associate (with Him)) of idols.

What does Muhammad (pbuh) say to you on behalf of your Lord? (they say: (Mere) fables of the men of old) the mere lies and tales of the people of old.
لِيَحْمِلُواْ أَوْزَارَهُمْ كَامِلَةً يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ وَمِنْ أَوْزَارِ ٱلَّذِينَ يُضِلُّونَهُمْ بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ أَلاَ سَآءَ مَا يَزِرُونَ,"(That they may bear their burdens) their sins (undiminished on the Day of Resurrection, with somewhat of the burdens) as well as the sins (of those whom they mislead) those whom they drove away from Muhammad (pbuh) and from the Qur'an and faith (without knowledge) or proof. (Ah! evil is that which they bear!) evil are the sins which they bear, i.e. those who were slain at the valley of Badr among the leaders of Quraysh."
قَدْ مَكَرَ ٱلَّذِينَ مِنْ قَبْلِهِمْ فَأَتَى ٱللَّهُ بُنْيَانَهُمْ مِّنَ ٱلْقَوَاعِدِ فَخَرَّ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلسَّقْفُ مِن فَوْقِهِمْ وَأَتَاهُمُ ٱلْعَذَابُ مِنْ حَيْثُ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ,"(Those before them plotted) against their prophets, just as the leaders of Quraysh who were slain in the valley of Badr plotted against Muhammad (pbuh); the reference here is to the tyrant Nimrod who built the tower, (so Allah struck at the foundations of their building) Allah extracted their tower from its foundation, (and then the roof fell down upon them) the tower fell upon him (from above them, and the doom came on them) through this destruction (whence they knew not);"

(Those who have been given knowledge) i.e. the angels (will say: Disgrace this day) the chastisement on this Day of Judgement (and evil) the Fire and hardship (are upon the disbelievers),"
ٱلَّذِينَ تَتَوَفَّاهُمُ ٱلْمَلائِكَةُ ظَالِمِي أَنْفُسِهِمْ فَأَلْقَوُاْ ٱلسَّلَمَ مَا كُنَّا نَعْمَلُ مِن سُوۤءٍ بَلَىٰ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلِيمٌ بِمَا كُنْتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ,"(Whom the angels cause to die) on the Day of Badr (while they are wronging themselves) through disbelief. (Then will they make full submission (saying)) they will answer; it is also said that this means: they resign to Allah, saying: (We used not to do any wrong) we did not worship anything beside Allah nor did we associate partners with Him. (Nay!) Allah will say: nay! (Surely Allah is Knower of what ye used to do) and say and worship beside Allah."
فَٱدْخُلُوۤاْ أَبْوَابَ جَهَنَّمَ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا فَلَبِئْسَ مَثْوَى ٱلْمُتَكَبِّرِينَ,"(So enter the gates of hell, to dwell therein for ever) neither to die nor leave it. (Woeful indeed will be the lodging of the arrogant) the abode of the disbelievers is Gehenna."

(Pleasant indeed will be the home of those who ward off (evil)) disbelief, idolatry, and indecencies."
جَنَّاتُ عَدْنٍ يَدْخُلُونَهَا تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلأَنْهَارُ لَهُمْ فِيهَا مَا يَشَآؤونَ كَذَلِكَ يَجْزِي ٱللَّهُ ٱلْمُتَّقِينَ,"(Gardens of Eden) this is the chamber of the All-Merciful (which they enter) on the Day of Judgement, (underneath which) beneath its trees and dwellings (rivers) of wine, water, honey and milk (flow, wherein) in Paradise (they have what they will) whatever they desire and like. (Thus Allah repayeth those who ward off (evil)) disbelief, idolatry, and indecencies."

هَلْ يَنْظُرُونَ إِلاَّ أَن تَأْتِيَهُمُ ٱلْمَلائِكَةُ أَوْ يَأْتِيَ أَمْرُ رَبِّكَ كَذَلِكَ فَعَلَ ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ وَمَا ظَلَمَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ وَلـٰكِن كَانُواْ أَنْفُسَهُمْ يَظْلِمُونَ,"(Await they) what are the people of Mecca waiting for after their disbelief (aught save that the angels should come unto them) to take away their souls (or your Lord's command should come to pass?) or that the chastisement of your Lord should come to destroy them. (Even so) just as your people denied you and vilified you so (did those before them) they denied their prophets and vilified them. (Allah wronged them not) when He destroyed them, (but they did wrong themselves) through their idolatry and denial of the prophets,"

(Even so) just as did your people lie about Allah by forbidding some crops and cattle, so (did those before them) lie about Allah. (Are the messengers charged) the messengers are entrusted (with aught save plain) in a plain language (conveyance (of the message)) from Allah?"
وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِي كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولاً أَنِ ٱعْبُدُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَٱجْتَنِبُواْ ٱلْطَّاغُوتَ فَمِنْهُم مَّنْ هَدَى ٱللَّهُ وَمِنْهُمْ مَّنْ حَقَّتْ عَلَيْهِ ٱلضَّلالَةُ فَسِيرُواْ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ فَٱنظُرُواْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَاقِبَةُ ٱلْمُكَذِّبِينَ,"(And verily We have raised in every nation) We have sent to every people (a messenger) just as We have sent you to your people, ((proclaiming): Serve Allah) believe in Allah's divine Oneness (and shun false gods) and leave the worship of idols; it is also said that this means: leave the worship of Satan; and it is also said that this means: leave the worship of soothsayers. (Then some of them) We sent messengers ((there were) whom Allah guided) to His religion, and so they accepted faith from the messengers, (and some of them (there were) upon whom error had just hold) it was decreed that they would not accept faith from the messengers. (Do but travel in the land and sea) reflect upon (the nature of the consequence for the deniers!) the end result of those who denied the messengers."
إِن تَحْرِصْ عَلَىٰ هُدَاهُمْ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لاَ يَهْدِي مَن يُضِلُّ وَمَا لَهُمْ مِّن نَّاصِرِينَ,"(Even if thou (O Muhammad) desirest their right guidance) their profession of Allah's divine Oneness, (still Allah assuredly will not guide) to His religion (him who misleadeth) His created beings from His religion, because this makes him undeserving of His religion.

وَقَالَ ٱللَّهُ لاَ تَتَّخِذُواْ إِلـٰهَيْنِ ٱثْنَيْنِ إِنَّمَا هُوَ إِلـٰهٌ وَاحِدٌ فَإيَّايَ فَٱرْهَبُونِ,"(Allah hath said: Choose not) worship not (two gods) i.e. Himself as well as the idols. (There is only One God) without a son or partner. (So of Me, Me only, be in awe) fear Me in relation to worshipping idols."
وَلَهُ مَا فِي ٱلْسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَلَهُ ٱلدِّينُ وَاصِباً أَفَغَيْرَ ٱللَّهِ تَتَّقُونَ,"(Unto Him belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth) of created beings and marvels, (and religion is His for ever) it is also said that this means: sincerely unto Him. (Will ye then fear) worshipping (any other than Allah?)"
وَمَا بِكُم مِّن نِّعْمَةٍ فَمِنَ ٱللَّهِ ثُمَّ إِذَا مَسَّكُمُ ٱلضُّرُّ فَإِلَيْهِ تَجْأَرُونَ,"(And whatever of comfort ye enjoy, it is from Allah) not from the idols. (Then, when misfortune) when hardship (reacheth you, unto Him) unto Allah (ye cry for help) and beseech."
ثُمَّ إِذَا كَشَفَ ٱلضُّرَّ عَنْكُمْ إِذَا فَرِيقٌ مِّنْكُم بِرَبِّهِمْ يُشْرِكُونَ,"(And afterward, when He hath rid you of the misfortune) when He removes hardship from you, (behold! a set of you) a group of you (attribute partners to their Lord) i.e. idols,"
لِيَكْفُرُواْ بِمَآ آتَيْنَاهُمْ فَتَمَتَّعُواْ فَسَوْفَ تَعْلَمُونَ,"(So as to deny that which We have given them) of bounty and thus say it was given to us through the intercession of our gods. (Then enjoy life (while you may)) live in disbelief and the forbidden, (for ye will come to know) what will be done to you."
وَيَجْعَلُونَ لِمَا لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ نَصِيباً مِّمّا رَزَقْنَاهُمْ تَٱللَّهِ لَتُسْأَلُنَّ عَمَّا كُنْتُمْ تَفْتَرُونَ,(And they assign a portion) a share for men to the exclusion of women (of that which We have given them) of cattle and crops (unto what they know not) and say: Allah commanded us to do so. (By Allah! but ye will indeed be asked) on the Day of Judgement (concerning (all) that ye used to invent) to lie about Allah.
وَيَجْعَلُونَ لِلَّهِ ٱلْبَنَاتِ سُبْحَانَهُ وَلَهُمْ مَّا يَشْتَهُونَ,(And they assign unto Allah daughters) they say: the angels are Allah's daughters. (Be He glorified!) Allah exonerates Himself from having children or partners (and unto themselves what they desire) of sons;
وَإِذَا بُشِّرَ أَحَدُهُمْ بِٱلأُنْثَىٰ ظَلَّ وَجْهُهُ مُسْوَدّاً وَهُوَ كَظِيمٌ,"(When if one of them receiveth tidings of the birth of a female, his face remaineth darkened) with grief, (and he is wroth inwardly) grief stricken and is inwardly devastated."
يَتَوَارَىٰ مِنَ ٱلْقَوْمِ مِن سُوۤءِ مَا بُشِّرَ بِهِ أَيُمْسِكُهُ عَلَىٰ هُونٍ أَمْ يَدُسُّهُ فِي ٱلتُّرَابِ أَلاَ سَآءَ مَا يَحْكُمُونَ,"(He hideth himself from the folk) he stays away from his folk (because of the evil) because of the dislike (of that whereof he hath bad tidings) because of the baby girl who was born to him, and hates to divulge it, ((asking himself): Shall he keep it) alive (in contempt) despite humiliation and hardship, (or bury it beneath the dust) alive. (Verily evil is their judgement) evil is their choice: they prefer sons for themselves and ascribe daughters to Allah."
لِلَّذِينَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱلآخِرَةِ مَثَلُ ٱلسَّوْءِ وَلِلَّهِ ٱلْمَثَلُ ٱلأَعْلَىٰ وَهُوَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ,"(For those who believe not in the Hereafter) in resurrection after death (is an evil similitude) i.e. the Fire, (and Allah's is the Sublime Similitude) the most sublime attribute: Godhood and Lordship without offspring or partners. (He is the Mighty) in His retribution against those who do not believe in Him, (the Wise) He ordered that none should be worshipped beside Him."
وَلَوْ يُؤَاخِذُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلنَّاسَ بِظُلْمِهِمْ مَّا تَرَكَ عَلَيْهَا مِن دَآبَّةٍ وَلٰكِن يُؤَخِّرُهُمْ إلَىٰ أَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّىٰ فَإِذَا جَآءَ أَجَلُهُمْ لاَ يَسْتَأْخِرُونَ سَاعَةً وَلاَ يَسْتَقْدِمُونَ,"(If Allah were to take mankind to task for their wrong-doing) their idolatry, (he would not leave hereon) on the face of the earth (a living creature) a jinn or human being, (but He reprieveth them to an appointed term) He reprieves them to the time of their destruction, (and when their term cometh) when the time of their destruction comes (they cannot put (it) off an hour nor (yet) advance (it)) nor can they be destroyed before their appointed term."
وَيَجْعَلُونَ لِلَّهِ مَا يَكْرَهُونَ وَتَصِفُ أَلْسِنَتُهُمُ ٱلْكَذِبَ أَنَّ لَهُمُ ٱلْحُسْنَىٰ لاَ جَرَمَ أَنَّ لَهُمُ ٱلْنَّارَ وَأَنَّهُمْ مُّفْرَطُونَ,"(And they assign unto Allah that which they (themselves) dislike) they say that Allah has daughters when they themselves do not like to have daughters, (and their tongues expound the lie) they speak lies (that the better portion will be theirs) i.e. sons will be theirs; it is also said that this means: Paradise will be theirs; and it is also said that this means: how could Paradise be theirs? (Assuredly theirs will be the Fire, and they will be abandoned) it is also said that this means: they are excessive people both in their words and deeds."
تَٱللَّهِ لَقَدْ أَرْسَلْنَآ إِلَىٰ أُمَمٍ مِّن قَبْلِكَ فَزَيَّنَ لَهُمُ ٱلشَّيْطَانُ أَعْمَالَهُمْ فَهُوَ وَلِيُّهُمُ ٱلْيَوْمَ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,"(By Allah, We verily sent messengers unto the nations before thee, but the devil made their deeds fair-seeming unto them) he made their religion fair-seeming to them. (So he is their patron this day) in this worldly life and their companion in hell, (and theirs will be a painful doom) in the Hereafter."
وَمَآ أَنْزَلْنَا عَلَيْكَ ٱلْكِتَابَ إِلاَّ لِتُبَيِّنَ لَهُمُ ٱلَّذِي ٱخْتَلَفُواْ فِيهِ وَهُدًى وَرَحْمَةً لِّقَوْمٍ يُؤْمِنُونَ,"(And we have revealed the Scripture unto thee) We did send Gabriel to you with the Qur'an (only that thou mayst explain unto them that wherein) in Religion (they differ) they opposed, (and (as) a guidance) from error (and a mercy) from chastisement (for a people who believe) in it."
وَٱللَّهُ أَنْزَلَ مِنَ ٱلْسَّمَآءِ مَآءً فَأَحْيَا بِهِ ٱلأَرْضَ بَعْدَ مَوْتِهَآ إِنَّ فِي ذٰلِكَ لآيَةً لِقَوْمٍ يَسْمَعُونَ,(Allah sendeth down water) rain (from the sky and therewith reviveth the earth after her death!) after being dry and affected by drought (Lo! Herein) in the revival of that which I have mentioned (is indeed a portent) a sign (for a folk who hear) who obey and believe.
وَإِنَّ لَكُمْ فِي ٱلأَنْعَامِ لَعِبْرَةً نُّسْقِيكُمْ مِّمَّا فِي بُطُونِهِ مِن بَيْنِ فَرْثٍ وَدَمٍ لَّبَناً خَالِصاً سَآئِغاً لِلشَّارِبِينَ,"(And lo! in the cattle there is a lesson for you. We give you to drink of that which is in their bellies, from betwixt the refuse and the blood), We extract (pure milk palatable to the drinkers) savoury to the drinkers."
وَمِن ثَمَرَاتِ ٱلنَّخِيلِ وَٱلأَعْنَابِ تَتَّخِذُونَ مِنْهُ سَكَراً وَرِزْقاً حَسَناً إِنَّ فِي ذٰلِكَ لآيَةً لِّقَوْمٍ يَعْقِلُونَ,"(And of the fruits of the date-palm, and grapes, whence ye derive strong drink) intoxicants. But this is abrogated; it is also said that this means: you derive food from it (and (also) good nourishment) a lawful nourishment such as vinegar, treacle, raisin and other things. (Lo! Therein) in that which I have mentioned to you, (is indeed a portent) a sign (for people who have sense) for people who believe."
وَأَوْحَىٰ رَبُّكَ إِلَىٰ ٱلنَّحْلِ أَنِ ٱتَّخِذِي مِنَ ٱلْجِبَالِ بُيُوتاً وَمِنَ ٱلشَّجَرِ وَمِمَّا يَعْرِشُونَ,"(And thy Lord inspired the bee, saying: Choose thou habitations in the hills and in the trees and in that which they thatch) and in that which they build;"
ثُمَّ كُلِي مِن كُلِّ ٱلثَّمَرَاتِ فَٱسْلُكِي سُبُلَ رَبِّكِ ذُلُلاً يَخْرُجُ مِن بُطُونِهَا شَرَابٌ مُّخْتَلِفٌ أَلْوَانُهُ فِيهِ شِفَآءٌ لِلنَّاسِ إِنَّ فِي ذٰلِكَ لآيَةً لِّقَوْمٍ يَتَفَكَّرُونَ,"(Then eat of all fruits) from all types of fruits, (and follow the ways of your Lord, made smooth (for thee)) made tractable for you. (There cometh forth from their bellies) from the bellies of bees (a drink diverse of hues) red, yellow and white, (wherein) in honey there (is healing for mankind) from illness; it is also said that this means: there is in the Qur'an healing for mankind. (Lo! Herein) in that which I have mentioned there (is indeed a portent) a sign and lesson (for people who reflect) on what I have created."
وَٱللَّهُ خَلَقَكُمْ ثُمَّ يَتَوَفَّاكُمْ وَمِنكُم مَّن يُرَدُّ إِلَىٰ أَرْذَلِ ٱلْعُمُرِ لِكَيْ لاَ يَعْلَمَ بَعْدَ عِلْمٍ شَيْئاً إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلِيمٌ قَدِيرٌ,"(And Allah createth you, then causeth you to die) He takes away your souls when your lifespan expires, (and among you is he who is brought back to the most abject stage of life, so that he knoweth) he understands (nothing after (having had) knowledge) before this state. (Lo! Allah is Knower) of the transformation of his creation, (Powerful) to turn them from one state to another."
وَٱللَّهُ فَضَّلَ بَعْضَكُمْ عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ فِي ٱلْرِّزْقِ فَمَا ٱلَّذِينَ فُضِّلُواْ بِرَآدِّي رِزْقِهِمْ عَلَىٰ مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُهُمْ فَهُمْ فِيهِ سَوَآءٌ أَفَبِنِعْمَةِ ٱللَّهِ يَجْحَدُونَ,"(And Allah hath favoured some of you above others in provision) this verse was revealed about the delegation of Najran who claimed that Jesus was the son of Allah. So Allah revealed this verse to tell people that He has favoured some people to the exclusion of others in relation to the possession of wealth and servants. (Now those who are more favoured) with wealth and servants (will by no means hand over their provision to those (slaves) whom their right hands possess, so that they) i.e. the master and the slave (may be equal with them in respect thereof) about wealth. They said: “We will not do so nor are we happy about this”, and so Allah said: (Is it then the grace of Allah that they deny?) Do you like for Me what you do not like for yourselves, and thus deny the Oneness of Allah?"
وَٱللَّهُ جَعَلَ لَكُمْ مِّنْ أَنْفُسِكُمْ أَزْوَاجاً وَجَعَلَ لَكُمْ مِّنْ أَزْوَاجِكُم بَنِينَ وَحَفَدَةً وَرَزَقَكُم مِّنَ ٱلطَّيِّبَاتِ أَفَبِٱلْبَاطِلِ يُؤْمِنُونَ وَبِنِعْمَتِ ٱللَّهِ هُمْ يَكْفُرُونَ,"(And Allah hath given you wives of your own kind) a human being like yourselves, (and hath given you, from your wives, sons and grandsons, and hath made provision of good things for you) he made your provision softer and more wholesome that the provision of beasts. (Is it then in vanity that they believe) is it in Satan and idols that they believe (and in the grace of Allah) and in the Oneness of Allah and His religion (that they disbelieve?)"
وَيَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ مَا لاَ يَمْلِكُ لَهُمْ رِزْقاً مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ شَيْئاً وَلاَ يَسْتَطِيعُونَ,"(And they worship beside Allah that which owneth) that which is capable of (no provision whatsoever for them) i.e. idols (from the heavens) by means of rain (or the earth) by means of vegetation, (nor have they (whom they worship) any power) to do so."
فَلاَ تَضْرِبُواْ لِلَّهِ ٱلأَمْثَالَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَعْلَمُ وَأَنْتُمْ لاَ تَعْلَمُونَ,"(So coin not similitudes for Allah) do not ascribe sons and partners and co-equals to Allah. (Lo! Allah knoweth) that He has no son or partner; (ye know not) this, O congregation of disbelievers."
ضَرَبَ ٱللَّهُ مَثَلاً عَبْداً مَّمْلُوكاً لاَّ يَقْدِرُ عَلَىٰ شَيْءٍ وَمَن رَّزَقْنَاهُ مِنَّا رِزْقاً حَسَناً فَهُوَ يُنْفِقُ مِنْهُ سِرّاً وَجَهْراً هَلْ يَسْتَوُونَ ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ بَلْ أَكْثَرُهُمْ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ,"Allah then gave a parable regarding the believer and the disbeliever, saying: (Allah coineth a similitude: (on the one hand) a (mere) chattel slave) Allah explained the traits of this slave, (who hath control of nothing) he has no power to spend or do any good, and in this respect he is just like the disbeliever from whom no good ever comes, (and (on the other hand) one on whom We have bestowed a fair provision) abundant wealth (from Us, and he spendeth thereof secretly) between him and his Lord (and openly) between him and other people for the sake of Allah; this is the simile of the sincere believer. (Are they equal) in their reward and obedience? (Praise be to Allah!) gratitude is due to Allah and divine Oneness is also Allah's. (But most of them know not) the parable of the Qur'an. It is also said that this verse was revealed about 'Uthman Ibn 'Affan and an Arab man called Abu'l-'Is Ibn Umayyah."
وَضَرَبَ ٱللَّهُ مَثَلاً رَّجُلَيْنِ أَحَدُهُمَآ أَبْكَمُ لاَ يَقْدِرُ عَلَىٰ شَيْءٍ وَهُوَ كَلٌّ عَلَىٰ مَوْلاهُ أَيْنَمَا يُوَجِّههُّ لاَ يَأْتِ بِخَيْرٍ هَلْ يَسْتَوِي هُوَ وَمَن يَأْمُرُ بِٱلْعَدْلِ وَهُوَ عَلَىٰ صِرَاطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ,"Then Allah gave a simile regarding Himself and the idols, saying: (And Allah coineth a similitude) Allah explains the traits of (two men, one of them dumb, having control of nothing) he cannot talk, this is the idol, (and he is a burden on his owner) his guardian and relatives; (whithersoever he directeth him) or call him (to go) east or west, (he bringeth no good) he does not respond to his caller with any good; this is the parable of the idol. (Is he equal) in terms of bringing benefit and driving away harm, i.e. the idol (with one who enjoineth justice) the Oneness of Allah (and followeth a straight path) i.e. Allah's divine Oneness, meaning Allah?"
وَلِلَّهِ غَيْبُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَمَآ أَمْرُ ٱلسَّاعَةِ إِلاَّ كَلَمْحِ ٱلْبَصَرِ أَوْ هُوَ أَقْرَبُ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,"(And Unto Allah belongeth the Unseen of the heavens and the earth) that which is hidden from the servants, (and the matter of the Hour (of Doom)) in its swiftness (is but as a twinkling of the eye, or it is nearer still. Lo! Allah is Able to do all things) the Resurrection as well as other things."
وَٱللَّهُ أَخْرَجَكُم مِّن بُطُونِ أُمَّهَاتِكُمْ لاَ تَعْلَمُونَ شَيْئاً وَجَعَلَ لَكُمُ ٱلْسَّمْعَ وَٱلأَبْصَارَ وَٱلأَفْئِدَةَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ,"(And Allah brought you forth from the wombs of your mothers knowing nothing) not knowing different kinds of things; it is also said that this means: not knowing anything, (and gave you hearing) with which you hear goodness (and sight) with which you see goodness (and hearts) with which you perceive goodness (that haply ye might give thanks) so that you give thanks to Allah for his blessings and believe in Him."
أَلَمْ يَرَوْاْ إِلَىٰ ٱلطَّيْرِ مُسَخَّرَٰتٍ فِي جَوِّ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مَا يُمْسِكُهُنَّ إِلاَّ ٱللَّهُ إِنَّ فِي ذٰلِكَ لأَيٰتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يُؤْمِنُونَ,"(Have you not seen) O people of Mecca, so that you realise Allah's power and divine Oneness (the birds obedient) subservient (in mid-air) flying between the sky and earth? (None holdeth them save Allah) after they fly. (Lo! Herein) in holding in mid-air, (verily, are portents) signs for Allah's divine Oneness (for a people who believe) that they are held in mid-air by Allah."
وَٱللَّهُ جَعَلَ لَكُمْ مِّن بُيُوتِكُمْ سَكَناً وَجَعَلَ لَكُمْ مِّن جُلُودِ ٱلأَنْعَامِ بُيُوتاً تَسْتَخِفُّونَهَا يَوْمَ ظَعْنِكُمْ وَيَوْمَ إِقَامَتِكُمْ وَمِنْ أَصْوَافِهَا وَأَوْبَارِهَا وَأَشْعَارِهَآ أَثَاثاً وَمَتَاعاً إِلَىٰ حِينٍ,"Then Allah mentioned his blessings so that they thank Him and believe in Him, saying: (And Allah hath given you in your houses) the houses of mud (an abode) and dwelling, (and hath given you (also), of the hides of cattle) of their wool, fur and hair, (houses) i.e. tents and canopies (which ye find light (to carry) on the day of migration) travel (and on the day of pitching camp; and of their wool) the wool of sheep (and their fur) the fur of camels (and their hair) the hair of goats, (caparison) wealth (and comfort) benefit (for a while) until their extinction or wearing out."
وَٱللَّهُ جَعَلَ لَكُمْ مِّمَّا خَلَقَ ظِلاَلاً وَجَعَلَ لَكُمْ مِّنَ ٱلْجِبَالِ أَكْنَاناً وَجَعَلَ لَكُمْ سَرَابِيلَ تَقِيكُمُ ٱلْحَرَّ وَسَرَابِيلَ تَقِيكُم بَأْسَكُمْ كَذَلِكَ يُتِمُّ نِعْمَتَهُ عَلَيْكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُسْلِمُونَ,"(And Allah hath given you, of that which He hath created) from trees, gardens and mountains, (shelter from the sun) from heat; (and hath given you places of refuge) caves and grottos (in the mountains, and hath given you coats to ward off the heat from you) in the summer and cold in the winter, (and coats (of armour) to save you from your own foolhardiness) from the arms of your own enemies. (Thus doth He perfect His favour unto you, in order that ye may surrender (unto Him)) in order that you believe; it is also said that this means: in order that you be safe from injury, according to another reading."
فَإِن تَوَلَّوْاْ فَإِنَّمَا عَلَيْكَ ٱلْبَلاَغُ ٱلْمُبِينُ,"(Then, if they turn away) from faith, (thy duty (O Muhammad) is but plain conveyance (of the message)) from Allah in a language that you understand."
يَعْرِفُونَ نِعْمَتَ ٱللَّهِ ثُمَّ يُنكِرُونَهَا وَأَكْثَرُهُمُ ٱلْكَافِرُونَ,"When the Prophet (pbuh) mentioned to them all those blessings, they agreed that all those blessings came from Allah, but then they denied this afterward, and said: no, we have all these blessings through the intercession of our gods. Allah said in response: (They know the favour of Allah) they acknowledge that all these blessings are from Allah (and then deny it) saying: we got them through the intercession of our gods. (Most of them are ingrates) all of them are disbelievers in Allah."
وَيَوْمَ نَبْعَثُ مِن كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ شَهِيداً ثُمَّ لاَ يُؤْذَنُ لِلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَلاَ هُمْ يُسْتَعْتَبُونَ,"(And (bethink you of) the day when We raise up of every nation) We take from every people (a witness) a prophet who testifies that he conveyed the message to them, (then there is no leave for disbelievers) to speak, (nor are they allowed to make amends) nor are they allowed to return to this worldly life."
وَإِذَا رَأى ٱلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ ٱلْعَذَابَ فَلاَ يُخَفَّفُ عَنْهُمْ وَلاَ هُمْ يُنظَرُونَ,"(And when those who did wrong) disbelieve (behold the doom, it will not be made light for them) it will not be lifted from them, (nor will they be reprieved) nor will the chastisement of Allah be deferred."
وَإِذَا رَأى ٱلَّذِينَ أَشْرَكُواْ شُرَكَآءَهُمْ قَالُواْ رَبَّنَا هَـٰؤُلآءِ شُرَكَآؤُنَا ٱلَّذِينَ كُنَّا نَدْعُوْا مِن دُونِكَ فَألْقَوْا إِلَيْهِمُ ٱلْقَوْلَ إِنَّكُمْ لَكَاذِبُونَ,"(And when those who ascribed partners to Allah behold those partners of theirs) their gods, (they will say: Our Lord!) O our Lord! (these are our partners) our gods (unto whom we used to cry instead of Thee) they commanded us to worship them. (But they will fling to them the saying) i.e. the idols will answer them and say: (Lo! ye verily are liars!) in what you say: we never commanded you to worship us nor were we aware of your worship."
وَأَلْقَوْاْ إِلَىٰ ٱللَّهِ يَوْمَئِذٍ ٱلسَّلَمَ وَضَلَّ عَنْهُم مَّا كَانُواْ يَفْتَرُونَ,"(And they proffer unto Allah submission on that day) both the worshipper and that which he worshipped in this worldly life will surrender to Allah, Exalted is He, (and all that they used to invent hath failed them) their lies about Allah will go in vain; it is also said that this means: the idols which they falsely worshipped will be occupied with themselves."
ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَصَدُّواْ عَن سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ زِدْنَاهُمْ عَذَاباً فَوْقَ ٱلْعَذَابِ بِمَا كَانُواْ يُفْسِدُونَ,"(For those who disbelieve) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an, (and debar (men) from the way of Allah) from the religion and obedience of Allah, (We add doom) the doom of snakes, scorpions, hunger, thirst, biting cold and other things (to doom) to the doom of hell (because they wrought corruption) because of what they said and did of transgressions and idolatry."

(And We reveal the Scripture unto thee) and We send Gabriel to you with the Qur'an (as an exposition of all things) of the lawful and unlawful, the commands and prohibitions, (and a guidance) from error (and a mercy) preventing from chastisement (and good tidings for those who have surrendered (to Allah)) that they will have Paradise."

(Most of them know not) that Allah commands His servants with that which is good for them."
قُلْ نَزَّلَهُ رُوحُ ٱلْقُدُسِ مِن رَّبِّكَ بِٱلْحَقِّ لِيُثَبِّتَ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَهُدًى وَبُشْرَىٰ لِلْمُسْلِمِينَ,"(Say) to them, O Muhammad: (The holy Spirit) the holy Gabriel (hath revealed it) i.e. the Qur'an (from thy Lord) O Muhammad (with truth) with the abrogating and the abrogated, (that it may confirm (the faith of)) that it may gladden and set at rest the hearts of (those who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an, (and as guidance) from error (and good tidings for those who have surrendered (to Allah)) that they will have Paradise."

Theirs will be an awful doom) the most awful torment in this worldly life. This verse was revealed about 'Abdullah Ibn Sa'd Ibn Abi Sarh."

ثُمَّ رَدَدْنَا لَكُمُ ٱلْكَرَّةَ عَلَيْهِمْ وَأَمْدَدْنَاكُم بِأَمْوَالٍ وَبَنِينَ وَجَعَلْنَاكُمْ أَكْثَرَ نَفِيراً,"(Then we gave you once again your turn against them) through Koresh's defeat of Nebuchadnezzar; it is also said that this means: and We had pity on you and thus gave you once again your turn against them, (and We aided you with wealth and children and made you more in soldiery) We made you more in men and numbers,"
إِنْ أَحْسَنْتُمْ أَحْسَنْتُمْ لأَنْفُسِكُمْ وَإِنْ أَسَأْتُمْ فَلَهَا فَإِذَا جَآءَ وَعْدُ ٱلآخِرَةِ لِيَسُوءُواْ وُجُوهَكُمْ وَلِيَدْخُلُواْ ٱلْمَسْجِدَ كَمَا دَخَلُوهُ أَوَّلَ مَرَّةٍ وَلِيُتَبِّرُواْ مَا عَلَوْاْ تَتْبِيراً,"((Saying): If ye do good) if you confess Allah's Oneness, (ye do good for your own souls) the reward for that is Paradise, (and If ye do evil) and if you associate partners with Allah, (it is for them (in like manner)) the punishment for that is upon them. They remained in comfort, merriness, abundance of men and numbers, and triumph over the enemy for 220 years until Allah roused against them Titus. (So, when the time for the second (of the judgements) came) the second of the two punishment or the second of the two corruptions ((We roused against you others of Our slaves) to ravage you) by killing you and taking you as captives, i.e. Titus the son of Espianos the Roman, (and to enter the Temple) Jerusalem (even as they entered it the first time) even as Nebuchadnezzar and his host entered it the first time, (and to lay waste all that they conquered with an utter wasting)."
عَسَىٰ رَبُّكُمْ أَن يَرْحَمَكُمْ وَإِنْ عُدتُّمْ عُدْنَا وَجَعَلْنَا جَهَنَّمَ لِلْكَافِرِينَ حَصِيراً,"(It may be that your Lord will have mercy on you) after that, (but if ye repeat (the crime) We shall repeat (the punishment)) it is also said that this means: if you return to doing good, We will return to bestowing mercy on you, (and We have appointed hell a dungeon) a prison and jail (for the disbelievers)."
إِنَّ هَـٰذَا ٱلْقُرْآنَ يَهْدِي لِلَّتِي هِيَ أَقْوَمُ وَيُبَشِّرُ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ ٱلَّذِينَ يَعْمَلُونَ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ أَنَّ لَهُمْ أَجْراً كَبِيراً,"(Lo! this Qur'an guideth) leads (unto that which is straightest) unto that which is more correct: the testimony that there is no god except Allah; it is also said that this means: unto that which is more plain, (and giveth tidings unto the believers) who are sincere in their faith (who do good works) solely between themselves and their Lord (that theirs will be a great reward) an abundant reward in Paradise."
وأَنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱلآخِرَةِ أَعْتَدْنَا لَهُمْ عَذَاباً أَلِيماً,"(And that those who believe not in the Hereafter) those who do not believe in resurrection after death, (for them We have prepared a painful doom) in the Hereafter."

(No laden soul can bear another's load) no soul laden with sin shall bear another person's sins with a good disposition of the soul, but rather she will bear them through retaliation; it is also said that this means: no soul will be punished for the sins committed by another soul; and it is also said that this means: no soul shall be chastised for the sins of another. (We never punish) a folk by causing their destruction (until We have sent) to them (a messenger) in order to establish a proof against them."

He says: do not give everything you have to one needy person or to one relative and leave all the rest, (lest thou sit down) lest you remain (rebuked) reproached by the needy and kinsmen, (denuded) cut off from kinsmen and the needy, without any wealth left. It is also said that this verse was revealed about a woman who asked for the shirt of the Prophet (pbuh). The latter took his shirt off, gave it to her and remained with his top bare. So Allah forbade him from doing so, telling him: do not open your hand completely when spending to the extent that you take off your shirt and give it away, and thus remain naked and blamed by people for remaining naked."
إِنَّ رَبَّكَ يَبْسُطُ ٱلرِّزْقَ لِمَن يَشَآءُ وَيَقْدِرُ إِنَّهُ كَانَ بِعِبَادِهِ خَبِيراً بَصِيراً,"(Lo! thy Lord) O Muhammad (enlargeth the provision) He enlarges wealth (for whom He will) of His servants as an act of consideration towards them, (and straiteneth (it for whom He will)) and He makes His provision straitened for some of His servants out of consideration for them.

وَلاَ تَقْتُلُوۤاْ أَوْلادَكُمْ خَشْيَةَ إِمْلاقٍ نَّحْنُ نَرْزُقُهُمْ وَإِيَّاكُم إنَّ قَتْلَهُمْ كَانَ خِطْئاً كَبِيراً,"(Slay not your children). This verse was revealed about the tribe of Khuza'ah who used to bury their new born daughters alive, and so Allah forbade them from doing so, telling them not bury their daughters alive, (fearing a fall to poverty) for fear of humiliation and poverty, (We shall provide for them) i.e. for your daughters (and for you. Lo! the slaying of them) burying them alive (is great sin) is a tremendous sin which deserves a great punishment."

Thus, he should not kill other than the killer himself; it is also said that this means, according to another reading: do not kill ten people to avenge the killing of one person. (Lo! he will be helped) for in that case, he will be killed and cannot be spared."
وَلاَ تَقْرَبُواْ مَالَ ٱلْيَتِيمِ إِلاَّ بِٱلَّتِي هِيَ أَحْسَنُ حَتَّىٰ يَبْلُغَ أَشُدَّهُ وَأَوْفُواْ بِالْعَهْدِ إِنَّ ٱلْعَهْدَ كَانَ مَسْؤُولاً,(Come not near the wealth of the orphan save with that which is better) through generating profit from it and by means of preserving it (till he come to strength) 15 or 18 years old; (and keep the covenant) that you pledged in the name of Allah between you and people.

أَوْ خَلْقاً مِّمَّا يَكْبُرُ فِي صُدُورِكُمْ فَسَيَقُولُونَ مَن يُعِيدُنَا قُلِ ٱلَّذِي فَطَرَكُمْ أَوَّلَ مَرَّةٍ فَسَيُنْغِضُونَ إِلَيْكَ رُؤُوسَهُمْ وَيَقُولُونَ مَتَىٰ هُوَ قُلْ عَسَىٰ أَن يَكُونَ قَرِيباً,"(Or some created thing that is yet greater in your thoughts) i.e. death! You will nonetheless be resurrected after death. (Then they will say: Who shall bring us back (to life)) who will revive us? (Say) to them, O Muhammad: (He who created you at the first) in the wombs of your mothers. (Then will they shake their heads at thee) in amazement at what you say to them, (and say: When will it be) when will be what you are promising us? (Say: It will perhaps) and 'perhaps' from Allah means that it is ordained (be soon);"
يَوْمَ يَدْعُوكُمْ فَتَسْتَجِيبُونَ بِحَمْدِهِ وَتَظُنُّونَ إِن لَّبِثْتُمْ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً,"Then He explained to them further, saying: (A day) on a Day (when He will call you) when Seraphiel will call you upon the blowing of the trumpet (and ye will answer with His praise) you will answer the caller of Allah by His command, (and ye will think that ye have tarried but a little while) you will think that you have stayed in your graves but a short time."
وَقُل لِّعِبَادِي يَقُولُواْ ٱلَّتِي هِيَ أَحْسَنُ إِنَّ ٱلشَّيْطَانَ يَنزَغُ بَيْنَهُمْ إِنَّ ٱلشَّيْطَانَ كَانَ لِلإِنْسَانِ عَدُوّاً مُّبِيناً,(Tell My bondmen) 'Umar and his fellow believers (to speak) to say to the disbelievers (that which is kindlier) i.e. greet them and be kind to them. (Lo! the devil soweth discord among them) when you treat them harshly. (Lo! the devil is for man an open foe) his enmity is quite manifest. This injunction was before they were commanded to fight.
رَّبُّكُمْ أَعْلَمُ بِكُمْ إِن يَشَأْ يَرْحَمْكُمْ أَوْ إِن يَشَأْ يُعَذِّبْكُمْ وَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَاكَ عَلَيْهِمْ وَكِيلاً,"(Your Lord is best aware of you) He knows what is best for you. (If He will, He will have mercy on you) and save you from the people of Mecca, (or if He will, He will punish you) and arouse them against you. (We have not sent thee (O Muhammad) as a warden over them) such that you will be taken to task over them."
وَرَبُّكَ أَعْلَمُ بِمَنْ فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَلَقَدْ فَضَّلْنَا بَعْضَ ٱلنَّبِيِّينَ عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ وَآتَيْنَا دَاوُودَ زَبُوراً,"(And thy Lord is best aware of all who are in the heavens and the earth) of the believers and what is best for them. (And we preferred some of the Prophets above others) through bestowing upon some Our friendship and speaking directly to others, (and unto David We gave the Psalms) and We gave Moses the Torah, Jesus the Gospel and Muhammad (pbuh) the Qur'an."
قُلِ ٱدْعُواْ ٱلَّذِينَ زَعَمْتُم مِّن دُونِهِ فَلاَ يَمْلِكُونَ كَشْفَ ٱلضُّرِّ عَنْكُمْ وَلاَ تَحْوِيلاً,"(Say) O Muhammad, to Khuza'ah who worshipped the jinn, thinking they were angels: (Cry unto those (saints and angels) whom ye assume (to be gods)) you worship (beside Him) apart from Allah in times of hardship, (yet they have no power to rid you of misfortune) they cannot remove hardship from you (nor to change) nor transfer this hardship to someone else."
أُولَـٰئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ يَدْعُونَ يَبْتَغُونَ إِلَىٰ رَبِّهِمُ ٱلْوَسِيلَةَ أَيُّهُمْ أَقْرَبُ وَيَرْجُونَ رَحْمَتَهُ وَيَخَافُونَ عَذَابَهُ إِنَّ عَذَابَ رَبِّكَ كَانَ مَحْذُوراً,"(Those unto whom they cry) worship (seek the way of approach to their Lord) seek nearness and merit with their Lord, (which of them shall be the nearest) to Allah; (they hope for His mercy) His Paradise (and they fear His doom. Lo! the doom of thy Lord is to be shunned) safety has not been granted to them."
وَإِن مِّن قَرْيَةٍ إِلاَّ نَحْنُ مُهْلِكُوهَا قَبْلَ يَوْمِ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ أَوْ مُعَذِّبُوهَا عَذَاباً شَدِيداً كَانَ ذٰلِك فِي ٱلْكِتَابِ مَسْطُوراً,"(There is not a township but We shall destroy it) We shall destroy its people (ere the Day of Resurrection, or punish it with dire punishment) with the sword and diseases. (That) destruction and torment (is set forth in the Book (of Our decrees)) is written in the Guarded Tablet."
وَمَا مَنَعَنَآ أَن نُّرْسِلَ بِٱلآيَاتِ إِلاَّ أَن كَذَّبَ بِهَا ٱلأَوَّلُونَ وَآتَيْنَا ثَمُودَ ٱلنَّاقَةَ مُبْصِرَةً فَظَلَمُواْ بِهَا وَمَا نُرْسِلُ بِٱلآيَاتِ إِلاَّ تَخْوِيفاً,"(Naught hindereth Us from) We were not hindered from (sending portents) the proofs they requested (save that the folk of old denied them) except the denial of the people of old, for upon denial of these proofs, We shall destroy them just as We destroyed those before them. (And We gave Thamud the she-camel) We gave the people of Salih a pregnant she-camel (a clear portent) a clear sign for the prophethood of Salih (but they did wrong about her) they denied the sign and killed her. (We send not portents) signs (save to warn) from torment, for We destroy them if they do not believe in them."
وَإِذْ قُلْنَا لَكَ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ أَحَاطَ بِٱلنَّاسِ وَمَا جَعَلْنَا ٱلرُّءْيَا ٱلَّتِي أَرَيْنَاكَ إِلاَّ فِتْنَةً لِّلنَّاسِ وَٱلشَّجَرَةَ ٱلْمَلْعُونَةَ فِي ٱلقُرْآنِ وَنُخَوِّفُهُمْ فَمَا يَزِيدُهُمْ إِلاَّ طُغْيَاناً كَبِيراً,"(And (it was a warning) when We told thee: Lo! thy Lord encompasseth mankind) He is aware of the people of Mecca: those who will believe and those who will not, (and We appointed the vision) We did not show you the vision (which We showed thee) in your nocturnal ascension (as an ordeal for mankind) as a misfortune for the people of Mecca, (and (likewise) the Accursed Tree in the Qur'an) and the same applies to the mention of the Zaqqum tree in the Qur'an. (We warn them) by the Zaqqum tree, (but it) the warning (increaseth them in naught save gross impiety) save further engagement in transgression."
وَإِذْ قُلْنَا لِلْمَلاۤئِكَةِ ٱسْجُدُواْ لأَدَمَ فَسَجَدُواْ إَلاَّ إِبْلِيسَ قَالَ أَأَسْجُدُ لِمَنْ خَلَقْتَ طِيناً,"(And when We said unto the angels) who were on the earth: (Fall down prostrate before Adam) a prostration of greeting (and they fell prostrate all save Iblis, he said: Shall I fall prostrate before that which Thou hast created of clay?)"
قَالَ أَرَأَيْتَكَ هَـٰذَا ٱلَّذِي كَرَّمْتَ عَلَيَّ لَئِنْ أَخَّرْتَنِ إِلَىٰ يَوْمِ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ لأَحْتَنِكَنَّ ذُرِّيَّتَهُ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً,"(He said: Seet Thou this (creature) whom Thou hast honoured above me) by means of this prostration, (if Thou give me grace) if you reprieve me (until the Day of Resurrection I verily will seize) I will cause to slip, overpower and dominate (his seed, save but a few) who are protected from me."
قَالَ ٱذْهَبْ فَمَن تَبِعَكَ مِنْهُمْ فَإِنَّ جَهَنَّمَ جَزَآؤُكُمْ جَزَاءً مَّوْفُوراً,"(He said: Go, and) Allah said to him: and know that (whosoever of them followeth thee) in your religion (lo! your payment, ample payment) an abundant portion."

(Satan promiseth them only to deceive) he promise them nothing except falsehood."
إِنَّ عِبَادِي لَيْسَ لَكَ عَلَيْهِمْ سُلْطَانٌ وَكَفَىٰ بِرَبِّكَ وَكِيلاً,"(Lo! My (faithful) bondmen) who are protected from you (over them thou hast no power) you have no way to get to them or overcome them, (and your Lord sufficeth as (their) guardian) He guarantees that which He promised; it is also said: He is Protector."

(Lo! He was ever Merciful towards you) by deferring your punishment; it is also said that this means: He is ever merciful towards whoever repents amongst you."
وَإِذَا مَسَّكُمُ ٱلْضُّرُّ فِي ٱلْبَحْرِ ضَلَّ مَن تَدْعُونَ إِلاَّ إِيَّاهُ فَلَمَّا نَجَّاكُمْ إِلَى ٱلْبَرِّ أَعْرَضْتُمْ وَكَانَ ٱلإِنْسَانُ كَفُوراً,"(And when harm) hardship and tribulation (toucheth you upon the sea, all unto whom ye cry (for succour) fail) you leave the idols which you worship, and you do not ask them to save you, (save Him (alone)) you only ask Allah to save you, (but when He bringeth you safe to land, ye turn away) from thanking Him and declaring His divine Oneness, (for man) the disbelieving man (was ever thankless) He denies the bounties of Allah."
أَفَأَمِنْتُمْ أَن يَخْسِفَ بِكُمْ جَانِبَ ٱلْبَرِّ أَوْ يُرْسِلَ عَلَيْكُمْ حَاصِباً ثُمَّ لاَ تَجِدُواْ لَكُمْ وَكِيلاً,"(Feel ye) O people of Mecca (then secure that He will not cause a slope of the land to engulf you) just as Korah was engulfed, (or send) or that He will not send (a sandstorm upon you,) stones upon you as He did send on the people of Lot, (and then ye will find that ye have no protector) no one to help you?"
أَمْ أَمِنْتُمْ أَن يُعِيدَكُمْ فِيهِ تَارَةً أُخْرَىٰ فَيُرْسِلَ عَلَيْكُمْ قَاصِفاً مِّنَ ٱلرِّيحِ فَيُغْرِقَكُم بِمَا كَفَرْتُمْ ثُمَّ لاَ تَجِدُواْ لَكُمْ عَلَيْنَا بِهِ تَبِيعاً,"(Or feel ye) O people of Mecca (secure that He will not return you to that (plight)) to the sea (a second time, and send against you a hurricane of wind and drown you) in the sea (for your thanklessness) for your denial of Allah and your ingratitude towards His bounty, (and then ye will not find therein that ye have any avenger against Us) for drowning you?"
وَلَقَدْ كَرَّمْنَا بَنِي ءَادَمَ وَحَمَلْنَاهُمْ فِي ٱلْبَرِّ وَٱلْبَحْرِ وَرَزَقْنَاهُمْ مِّنَ ٱلطَّيِّبَاتِ وَفَضَّلْنَاهُمْ عَلَىٰ كَثِيرٍ مِّمَّنْ خَلَقْنَا تَفْضِيلاً,"(Verily We have honoured the children of Adam) by giving them hands and feet. (We carry them on the land) on the backs of beasts (and the sea) aboard ships, (and have made provision of good things for them) We made their provision better and finer than the provision of beasts, (and have preferred them above many of those whom We created) of animals (with a marked preferment) in forms, feet and hands."
يَوْمَ نَدْعُواْ كُلَّ أُنَاسٍ بِإِمَامِهِمْ فَمَنْ أُوتِيَ كِتَابَهُ بِيَمِينِهِ فَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ يَقْرَؤونَ كِتَابَهُمْ وَلاَ يُظْلَمُونَ فَتِيلاً,"(On the day) the Day of Judgement (when We shall summon all men with their record) with their prophet; and it is also said that this means: with their register; and it is also said that this means: with their callers to guidance and error, (whoso is given his book in his right hand such will read their book) their good deeds (and they will not be wronged a shred) their good deeds will not be diminished nor will their evil deeds be increased."
وَمَن كَانَ فِي هَـٰذِهِ أَعْمَىٰ فَهُوَ فِي ٱلآخِرَةِ أَعْمَىٰ وَأَضَلُّ سَبِيلاً,"(Whoso is blind) from giving thanks (here) about these bounties (will be blind in the Hereafter) about the bliss of Paradise, (and yet further from the road). It is also said that this means: whoever is in this worldly life blind to seeing the proof and exposition, will be in the Hereafter even more blind and farther away from proof."
وَإِن كَادُواْ لَيَفْتِنُونَكَ عَنِ ٱلَّذِي أَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَيْكَ لِتَفْتَرِيَ عَلَيْنَا غَيْرَهُ وَإِذاً لاَّتَّخَذُوكَ خَلِيلاً,"(And they indeed strove hard) they almost succeeded (to beguile thee (Muhammad) away) to drive you away and make you slip (from that wherewith We have inspired thee) regarding the breaking of their idols, (that thou shouldst invent) that you should say (other than it against Us) other than what We commanded you to do: breaking their idols; (and then would they have accepted thee as a friend) because of following them. This verse was revealed about Thaqif."
وَلَوْلاَ أَن ثَبَّتْنَاكَ لَقَدْ كِدتَّ تَرْكَنُ إِلَيْهِمْ شَيْئاً قَلِيلاً,(And if We had not made thee wholly firm) if We had not protected and preserved you (thou mightest almost have inclined unto them a little) regarding that which they requested from you.
إِذاً لأذَقْنَاكَ ضِعْفَ ٱلْحَيَاةِ وَضِعْفَ ٱلْمَمَاتِ ثُمَّ لاَ تَجِدُ لَكَ عَلَيْنَا نَصِيراً,"(Then) if you had granted to them what they requested (had We made thee taste a double (punishment) of living) the chastisement of this worldly life (and a double (punishment) of dying) the chastisement of the Hereafter, (then hadst thou found no helper against Us) you would not find anyone to save you from Us."
وَإِن كَادُواْ لَيَسْتَفِزُّونَكَ مِنَ ٱلأَرْضِ لِيُخْرِجوكَ مِنْهَا وَإِذاً لاَّ يَلْبَثُونَ خِلافَكَ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً,"(And they indeed wished to scare thee from the land) the land of Medina (that they might drive thee forth from thence) to Historic Syria, (and then) if they succeeded in driving you away from Medina (they would have stayed (there) but a little after thee) before We destroy them."

أَقِمِ ٱلصَّلاَةَ لِدُلُوكِ ٱلشَّمْسِ إِلَىٰ غَسَقِ ٱلَّيلِ وَقُرْآنَ ٱلْفَجْرِ إِنَّ قُرْآنَ ٱلْفَجْرِ كَانَ مَشْهُوداً,"(Establish worship) perform the prayer, O Muhammad, (at the going down of the sun) after noon: the prayers of Zuhr and 'Asr (until the dark of night) and after the advent of the night: the prayers of Maghrib and 'Isha', (and (the recital of) the Qur'an at dawn) the prayer of the morning. (Lo! (the recital of) the Qur'an at dawn) the prayer of the morning (is ever witnessed) is witnessed by the angels of the night and the angels of the day."
وَمِنَ ٱلْلَّيْلِ فَتَهَجَّدْ بِهِ نَافِلَةً لَّكَ عَسَىٰ أَن يَبْعَثَكَ رَبُّكَ مَقَاماً مَّحْمُوداً,"(And some part of the night awake for it) to recite the Qur'an and to pray after sleeping a little, (a largess for thee) a merit for you; it is also said that this means: you alone are enjoined to do so. (It may be) and the expression 'may be' when used in connection with Allah means: it is a requisite (that thy Lord will raise thee to a praised estate) the station of intercession whereof you will be praised by the people of old and the people of new."
وَقُل رَّبِّ أَدْخِلْنِي مُدْخَلَ صِدْقٍ وَأَخْرِجْنِي مُخْرَجَ صِدْقٍ وَٱجْعَل لِّي مِن لَّدُنْكَ سُلْطَاناً نَّصِيراً,"(And say: My Lord!) O my Lord! (Cause me to come in with a firm incoming) he says: cause me to come to Medina with a firm incoming, he said this when he was leaving Medina (and to go out) of Medina (with a firm outgoing) after staying there and cause me to enter Mecca; it is also said that this means: cause me to come in the grave with a firm incoming, and cause me to come out of the grave on the Day of Judgement with a firm outgoing. (And give me from Your presence) from You (a sustaining Power) a help that is free of abasement or rejection."
وَقُلْ جَآءَ ٱلْحَقُّ وَزَهَقَ ٱلْبَاطِلُ إِنَّ ٱلْبَاطِلَ كَانَ زَهُوقاً,"(And say: Truth hath come) Muhammad (pbuh) has come with the Qur'an; it is also said that this means: Islam has become triumphant and Muslims numerous (and falsehood hath vanished away) Satan, idolatry and its people all perished. (Lo! Falsehood) Satan, idolatry and its adherents (is ever bound to vanish) is ever bound to perish."
وَنُنَزِّلُ مِنَ ٱلْقُرْآنِ مَا هُوَ شِفَآءٌ وَرَحْمَةٌ لِّلْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَلاَ يَزِيدُ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ إَلاَّ خَسَاراً,"(And We reveal of the Qur'an) We explain in the Qur'an (that which is a healing) a clarification against blindness; it is also said that this means: a clarification against disbelief, idolatry and hypocrisy (and a mercy) which prevents from chastisement (for believers) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an (though it increase the evil-doers) the idolaters; that which is revealed in the Qur'an increases them (in naught save ruin) loss."
وَإِذَآ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَى ٱلإنْسَانِ أَعْرَضَ وَنَأَى بِجَانِبِهِ وَإِذَا مَسَّهُ ٱلشَّرُّ كَانَ يَئُوساً,"(And when We make life pleasant unto man) i.e. the disbeliever, when We bestow upon him abundant wealth and a comfortable life, (he turneth away) from giving thanks or making supplications to Allah (and is averse) stirs away from faith; (and when ill) hardship and poverty (toucheth him he is in despair) from Allah's mercy. This verse was revealed about 'Utbah Ibn Rabi'ah."
قُلْ كُلٌّ يَعْمَلُ عَلَىٰ شَاكِلَتِهِ فَرَبُّكُمْ أَعْلَمُ بِمَنْ هُوَ أَهْدَىٰ سَبِيلاً,"(Say) O Muhammad: (Each one) of you (doth according to his rule of conduct) according to his intention and the state in which he is in; it is also said that this means: according to his standpoint and natural disposition, (and thy Lord is best aware of him whose way is right) whose religion is correct."
وَيَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ ٱلرُّوحِ قُلِ ٱلرُّوحُ مِنْ أَمْرِ رَبِّي وَمَآ أُوتِيتُم مِّنَ ٱلْعِلْمِ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً,"(They will ask thee) O Muhammad (concerning the Spirit) it was the people of Mecca-Abu Jahl and his host-who asked. (Say: The Spirit is by command of my Lord) the Spirit is of the marvels of my Lord; it is also said that this means: it is the restricted knowledge of my Lord, (and of knowledge) which is with Allah (ye have been vouchsafed) you have been given (but little)."
وَلَئِن شِئْنَا لَنَذْهَبَنَّ بِٱلَّذِي أَوْحَيْنَا إِلَيْكَ ثُمَّ لاَ تَجِدُ لَكَ بِهِ عَلَيْنَا وَكِيلاً,"(And if We willed We could withdraw that which We have revealed unto thee) We could keep away that with which We have sent Gabriel to inspire you, (then wouldst thou find no guardian) and it is said that this means: no helper (for thee against Us in respect thereof)."
إِلاَّ رَحْمَةً مِّن رَّبِّكَ إِنَّ فَضْلَهُ كَانَ عَلَيْكَ كَبِيراً,((It is naught) save mercy) blessing (from thy Lord) He preserved the Qur'an in your heart. (Lo! His kindness unto you) through granting you prophethood and Islam (was ever great) was tremendous indeed.
قُل لَّئِنِ ٱجْتَمَعَتِ ٱلإِنْسُ وَٱلْجِنُّ عَلَىٰ أَن يَأْتُواْ بِمِثْلِ هَـٰذَا ٱلْقُرْآنِ لاَ يَأْتُونَ بِمِثْلِهِ وَلَوْ كَانَ بَعْضُهُمْ لِبَعْضٍ ظَهِيراً,"(Say) O Muhammad to the people of Mecca: (Verily, though mankind and the jinn should assemble to produce the like of this Qur'an) conveying therein commands and prohibitions, promises and threats, abrogating and abrogated verses, clear and ambiguous verses and the events of the past and of the future, (they could not produce the like thereof though they were helpers one of another)."
وَلَقَدْ صَرَّفْنَا لِلنَّاسِ فِي هَـٰذَا ٱلْقُرْآنِ مِن كُلِّ مَثَلٍ فَأَبَىٰ أَكْثَرُ ٱلنَّاسِ إِلاَّ كُفُوراً,"(And verily We have displayed for mankind) We have exposited for the people of Mecca (in this Qur'an all kinds or similitudes) parables of all sorts, such as threats and promises, (but most of mankind refuse aught save disbelief) they refused to submit and remained firm in their disbelief."
وَقَالُواْ لَن نُّؤْمِنَ لَكَ حَتَّىٰ تَفْجُرَ لَنَا مِنَ ٱلأَرْضِ يَنْبُوعاً,(And they say) i.e. 'Abdullah Ibn Umayyah al-Makhzumi and his host: (We will not put faith in thee) we will not believe you (till thou cause a spring to gush forth from the earth for us) from the earth of Mecca for us;
أَوْ تَكُونَ لَكَ جَنَّةٌ مِّن نَّخِيلٍ وَعِنَبٍ فَتُفَجِّرَ ٱلأَنْهَارَ خِلالَهَا تَفْجِيراً,"(Or thou have a garden of date-palms and grapes, and cause rivers to gush forth therein) i.e. in their middle (abundantly);"
أَوْ تُسْقِطَ ٱلسَّمَآءَ كَمَا زَعَمْتَ عَلَيْنَا كِسَفاً أَوْ تَأْتِيَ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلْمَلاۤئِكَةِ قَبِيلاً,"(Or thou cause the heaven to fall upon us piecemeal) as a punishment, (as thou hast pretended, or bring Allah and the angels as a warrant) as witnesses for what you say;"
أَوْ يَكُونَ لَكَ بَيْتٌ مِّن زُخْرُفٍ أَوْ تَرْقَىٰ فِي ٱلسَّمَآءِ وَلَن نُّؤْمِنَ لِرُقِيِّكَ حَتَّى تُنَزِّلَ عَلَيْنَا كِتَاباً نَّقْرَؤُهُ قُلْ سُبْحَانَ رَبِّي هَلْ كُنتُ إِلاَّ بَشَراً رَّسُولاً,"(Or thou have a house of gold) and silver; (or thou ascend up into heaven) and bring with you the angel to testify that you are Allah's messenger to us, (and even then we will put no faith in thine ascension) to heaven (till thou bring down for us a book) from Allah to us (that we can read) in which we find that you are Allah's messenger to us. (Say) to them, O Muhammad: (My Lord be glorified!) I exonerate my Lord from having a son or partner, (Am I naught save a mortal messenger?) he says: I am only a human messenger, like all previous messengers."
وَمَا مَنَعَ ٱلنَّاسَ أَن يُؤْمِنُوۤاْ إِذْ جَآءَهُمُ ٱلْهُدَىٰ إِلاَّ أَن قَالُوۤاْ أَبَعَثَ ٱللَّهُ بَشَراً رَّسُولاً,(And naught prevented mankind) the people of Mecca (from believing) in Allah (when the guidance) Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an (came unto them save that they said) these words: (Hath Allah sent a mortal as (His) messenger) to us?
قُل لَوْ كَانَ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ مَلاۤئِكَةٌ يَمْشُونَ مُطْمَئِنِّينَ لَنَزَّلْنَا عَلَيْهِم مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مَلَكاً رَّسُولاً,"(Say) O Muhammad, to the people of Mecca: (If there were in the earth angels walking secure, We had sent down for them from heaven an angel as messenger) for we send angel messengers only to angels and human messengers to humans."
قُلْ كَفَىٰ بِٱللَّهِ شَهِيداً بَيْنِي وَبَيْنَكُمْ إِنَّهُ كَانَ بِعِبَادِهِ خَبِيراً بَصِيراً,"(Say) O Muhammad, to the people of Mecca: (Allah sufficeth for a witness between me and you) that I am a messenger to you (Lo! He is) in relation to sending messengers to His servants (Knower, Seer of His slaves) those who believe and those who do not."
وَمَن يَهْدِ ٱللَّهُ فَهُوَ ٱلْمُهْتَدِ وَمَن يُضْلِلْ فَلَن تَجِدَ لَهُمْ أَوْلِيَآءَ مِن دُونِهِ وَنَحْشُرُهُمْ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ عَلَىٰ وُجُوهِهِمْ عُمْياً وَبُكْماً وَصُمّاً مَّأْوَاهُمْ جَهَنَّمُ كُلَّمَا خَبَتْ زِدْنَاهُمْ سَعِيراً,"(And he whom Allah guideth) to His religion, (he is led aright) to His religion; (while, as for him whom He sendeth astray) from His religion, (for them) for the people of Mecca (thou wilt find no protecting friends beside Him) to lead them to guidance, (and We shall assemble them) We shall drag them (on the Day of Resurrection on their faces) to the Fire, (blind) seeing nothing, (dumb) saying nothing (and deaf) hearing nothing; (their habitation) their destination (will be hell; whenever it abateth) whenever the Fire abates and its flames subside, (We increase the flame for them) We add more fuel to it."
ذَلِكَ جَزَآؤُهُم بِأَنَّهُمْ كَفَرُواْ بِآيَاتِنَا وَقَالُواْ أَءِذَا كُنَّا عِظَاماً وَرُفَاتاً أَءِنَّا لَمَبْعُوثُونَ خَلْقاً جَدِيداً,"(That) chastisement (is their reward) their lot (because they disbelieved Our revelations) Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an (and said) and the disbelievers of Mecca said: (When we are) rotten (bones and) scattered (fragments shall we, forsooth, be raised up) revived (as a new creation?) the spirit is renewed in us? This can never happen!"
أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْاْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ ٱلَّذِي خَلَقَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضَ قَادِرٌ عَلَىٰ أَن يَخْلُقَ مِثْلَهُمْ وَجَعَلَ لَهُمْ أَجَلاً لاَّ رَيْبَ فِيهِ فَأَبَىٰ ٱلظَّالِمُونَ إِلاَّ كُفُوراً,"(Have they) i.e. the people of Mecca (not seen that Allah Who created the heavens and the earth is Able to create) to revive (the like of them, and has appointed for them an end) a term (whereof there is no doubt) as far as the believers are concerned? (But the wrong-doers) the idolaters (refuse aught save disbelief) they rejected this and stayed firm in their disbelief."
قُل لَّوْ أَنْتُمْ تَمْلِكُونَ خَزَآئِنَ رَحْمَةِ رَبِّي إِذاً لأمْسَكْتُمْ خَشْيَةَ ٱلإِنْفَاقِ وَكَانَ ٱلإنْسَانُ قَتُوراً,"(Say) O Muhammad, to the people of Mecca: (If you possessed the treasures of the mercy of my Lord) if you possessed the keys to the stores of the provision of my Lord, (ye would surely hold them back for fear of spending) for fear of becoming poor, (for man) i.e. the disbelieving man (was ever grudging) parsimonious, stingy and tight-fisted."
وَلَقَدْ آتَيْنَا مُوسَىٰ تِسْعَ آيَاتٍ بَيِّنَاتٍ فَسْئَلْ بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ إِذْ جَآءَهُمْ فَقَالَ لَهُ فِرْعَونُ إِنِّي لأَظُنُّكَ يٰمُوسَىٰ مَسْحُوراً,"(And verily We gave unto Moses nine tokens clear proofs (of Allah's Sovereignty)) nine clear signs: the hand, the staff, the flood, the locusts, the lice, blood, the years of drought and the disappearance of properties. (Do but ask the Children of Israel) 'Abdullah Ibn Salam and his followers (how he) Moses (came unto them, then Pharaoh said unto him: Lo! I deem thee one bewitched, O Moses) I think that you are possessed."
قَالَ لَقَدْ عَلِمْتَ مَآ أَنزَلَ هَـٰؤُلاۤءِ إِلاَّ رَبُّ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ بَصَآئِرَ وَإِنِّي لأَظُنُّكَ يٰفِرْعَونُ مَثْبُوراً,"(He said) Moses said to him: (In truth thou knowest) O Pharaoh (that none sent down these (portents)) these signs (save the Lord of the heavens and the earth as proofs) as an indication and sign of my prophethood, (and lo! (for my part) I deem) I know and believe (thee lost, O Pharaoh) that you are a lost disbeliever."
فَأَرَادَ أَن يَسْتَفِزَّهُم مِّنَ ٱلأَرْضِ فَأَغْرَقْنَاهُ وَمَن مَّعَهُ جَمِيعاً,"(And he wished to scare them from the land) the land of Jordan and Palestine, (but We drowned him) in the sea (and those with him, all together)."
وَقُلْنَا مِن بَعْدِهِ لِبَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ ٱسْكُنُواْ ٱلأَرْضَ فَإِذَا جَآءَ وَعْدُ ٱلآخِرَةِ جِئْنَا بِكُمْ لَفِيفاً,(And We said unto the Children of Israel after him) after his destruction: (Dwell in the land) the land of Jordan and Palestine; (but when the promise of the Hereafter) when resurrection after death; and it is also said that this means: when Jesus son of Mary descends (cometh to pass we shall bring you as a crowd gathered out of various nations.)
وَبِٱلْحَقِّ أَنْزَلْنَاهُ وَبِٱلْحَقِّ نَزَلَ وَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَاكَ إِلاَّ مُبَشِّراً وَنَذِيراً,"(With truth have We sent it down) We have sent Gabriel to Muhammad (pbuh) with the Qur'an, (and with truth hath it descended) he descended with the Qur'an. (And We have sent thee) O Muhammad (as naught else save a bearer of good tidings) of Paradise (and a warner) from hell."
وَقُرْآناً فَرَقْنَاهُ لِتَقْرَأَهُ عَلَى ٱلنَّاسِ عَلَىٰ مُكْثٍ وَنَزَّلْنَاهُ تَنْزِيلاً,"(And (it is) a Qur'an) And We have sent Gabriel with the Qur'an (that We have divided) We explained therein the lawful and unlawful, the commands and prohibitions, (that thou mayst recite it unto mankind at intervals) in a composed manner, deliberately and thoughtfully, (and We have revealed it by (successive) revelation) We have exposited it clearly; it is also said that this means: We have sent Gabriel with the Qur'an in different phases, each time with two or three verses, and so on and so forth."
قُلْ آمِنُواْ بِهِ أَوْ لاَ تُؤْمِنُوۤاْ إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ ٱلْعِلْمَ مِن قَبْلِهِ إِذَا يُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْهِمْ يَخِرُّونَ لِلأَذْقَانِ سُجَّداً,"(Say) O Muhammad, to them: (Believe therein) believe in the Qur'an (or believe not) this is a threat to them, (lo! those who were given knowledge) those who were given knowledge of the Torah and are aware of the description and attributes of Muhammad (pbuh) (before it) before the Qur'an, (when it is read unto them) when the Qur'an is read to them, (fall down prostrate on their faces, adoring) they prostrate to Allah,"
وَيَقُولُونَ سُبْحَانَ رَبِّنَآ إِن كَانَ وَعْدُ رَبِّنَا لَمَفْعُولاً,(Saying: Glory to our Lord!) they exonerate Allah from having a son or partner. (Verily the promise of our Lord) regarding the sending of Muhammad (pbuh) (must be fulfilled) is true and must happen.
وَيَخِرُّونَ لِلأَذْقَانِ يَبْكُونَ وَيَزِيدُهُمْ خُشُوعاً,"(They fall down on their faces) in prostration, (weeping) in their prostration, (and it increaseth humility in them) this was revealed about 'Abdullah Ibn Salam and his companions."
قُلِ ٱدْعُواْ ٱللَّهَ أَوِ ٱدْعُواْ ٱلرَّحْمَـٰنَ أَيّاً مَّا تَدْعُواْ فَلَهُ ٱلأَسْمَآءَ ٱلْحُسْنَىٰ وَلاَ تَجْهَرْ بِصَلاَتِكَ وَلاَ تُخَافِتْ بِهَا وَٱبْتَغِ بَيْنَ ذٰلِكَ سَبِيلاً,"(Say) to them, O Muhammad: (Cry unto Allah, or cry unto the Beneficent, unto whichsoever ye cry (it is the same). His are the most beautiful names) the most sublime attributes such as knowledge, power, hearing, sight; so call Him by using them. (And thou (Muhammad), be not loud voiced in thy worship) do not be too loud in your recitation of the Qur'an during prayer so that the idolaters do not harm you (nor yet silent therein) such that your Companions cannot hear you, (but follow a way between) a middle ground between loud and silent recitation."
وَقُلِ ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ ٱلَّذِي لَمْ يَتَّخِذْ وَلَداً وَلَم يَكُنْ لَّهُ شَرِيكٌ فِي ٱلْمُلْكِ وَلَمْ يَكُنْ لَّهُ وَلِيٌّ مِّنَ ٱلذُّلِّ وَكَبِّرْهُ تَكْبِيراً,"(And say: Praise be to Allah) gratitude and divinity are Allah's, (Who hath not taken unto Himself a son) from amongst the angels or humans such that he inherits His dominion, (and Who hath no partner in the Sovereignty) such that he shows enmity towards Him, (nor hath He any protecting friend) a helper (through dependence) from among the Jews and Christians; it is also said that this means: He has not been humiliated such that He needs a helper from the Jews or Christians. (And magnify Him with all magnificence) deem Him far exalted above what the Jews, Christians and idolaters say about Him; and Allah knows better the secrets of His Book."
ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ ٱلَّذِي أَنْزَلَ عَلَىٰ عَبْدِهِ ٱلْكِتَابَ وَلَمْ يَجْعَل لَّهُ عِوَجَا,"And from his own narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said regarding the meaning of Allah's words (Praise be to Allah): '(Praise be to Allah) He says: gratitude is Allah's and divinity is His (Who hath revealed the Scripture) who has sent Gabriel with the Qur'an (unto His slave) Muhammad (pbuh) (and hath not placed therein any crookedness) He did not reveal it as different from the Torah, the Gospel or other Scriptures, as far as divine Oneness and the attributes and description of Muhammad (pbuh) are concerned. This verse was revealed about the Jews when they claimed that the Qur'an was different from all previous Scriptures,"
قَيِّماً لِّيُنْذِرَ بَأْساً شَدِيداً مِّن لَّدُنْهُ وَيُبَشِّرَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ ٱلَّذِينَ يَعْمَلُونَ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ أَنَّ لَهُمْ أَجْراً حَسَناً,"((But hath made it) straight) and it is also said that this means: custodian over all other Scriptures, (to give warning) so that Muhammad (pbuh) gives warning by means of the Qur'an (of stern punishment from Him, and to bring) and so that Muhammad brings the Qur'an (unto the) sincere (believers who do good works) between them and their Lord (the news that theirs will be a fair reward) they will have a fair reward in Paradise."
مَّاكِثِينَ فِيهِ أَبَداً,(Wherein they will abide for ever) they will abide in this reward forever: never to die or be removed from it;
وَيُنْذِرَ ٱلَّذِينَ قَالُواْ ٱتَّخَذَ ٱللَّهُ وَلَداً,"(And to warn) and so that Muhammad (pbuh) warns by means of the Qur'an (those who say: Allah hath chosen a son) i.e. the Jews, Christians and idolaters,"
مَّا لَهُمْ بِهِ مِنْ عِلْمٍ وَلاَ لآبَائِهِمْ كَبُرَتْ كَلِمَةً تَخْرُجُ مِنْ أَفْوَاهِهِمْ إِن يَقُولُونَ إِلاَّ كَذِباً,"((A thing) whereof they have no knowledge) they have no proof or argument for what they claim, (nor (had) their fathers) nor did their fathers have any knowledge. (Dreadful is the word) dreadful is the word of idolatry (that cometh out of their mouths) that is uttered by their mouth. (They speak naught but a lie) about Allah."
فَلَعَلَّكَ بَاخِعٌ نَّفْسَكَ عَلَىٰ آثَارِهِمْ إِن لَّمْ يُؤْمِنُواْ بِهَـٰذَا ٱلْحَدِيثِ أَسَفاً,"(Yet it may be, if they believe not in this statement) if they do not believe in this Qur'an, (that thou) O Muhammad (wilt torment thy soul) kill yourself (with grief over their footsteps) for them."
إِنَّا جَعَلْنَا مَا عَلَى ٱلأَرْضِ زِينَةً لَّهَا لِنَبْلُوَهُمْ أَيُّهُم أَحْسَنُ عَمَلاً,"(Lo! We have placed all that is in the earth) of male and female (as an ornament thereof) as an embellishment for the earth (that we may try them) that We may test them: (which of them is best in conduct) which of them is more sincere in works. It is also said that this means: We have made all that which is on earth of plants, trees, beasts, and comfort an ornament for the earth so that We test them which of them is more unattached to, and shunning of, this world."
وَإِنَّا لَجَاعِلُونَ مَا عَلَيْهَا صَعِيداً جُرُزاً,(And lo! We shall make) change (all that is therein) of ornament into (a barren mound) a smooth dust with no vegetation.
أَمْ حَسِبْتَ أَنَّ أَصْحَابَ ٱلْكَهْفِ وَٱلرَّقِيمِ كَانُواْ مِنْ آيَاتِنَا عَجَباً,"(Or deemest thou) O Muhammad (that the People of the Cave and the Inscription) whereof the names of these youth and their story were inscribed; it is also said that the inscription refers to the valley where this cave was; and it is also said that it refers to a city (are a wonder among Our portents) such as the sun, the moon, the sky, the earth, the stars, the oceans and even that which is more wonderous than this?"
إِذْ أَوَى ٱلْفِتْيَةُ إِلَى ٱلْكَهْفِ فَقَالُواْ رَبَّنَآ آتِنَا مِن لَّدُنكَ رَحْمَةً وَهَيِّىءْ لَنَا مِنْ أَمْرِنَا رَشَداً,(When the young men fled for refuge to the Cave) when a group of youth entered the Cave (and said) when they entered the cave: (Our Lord!) O our Lord! (Give us mercy from Thy presence) i.e. make us hold firmly to your religion (and shape for us right conduct in our plight) make for us a way out.
فَضَرَبْنَا عَلَىٰ آذَانِهِمْ فِي ٱلْكَهْفِ سِنِينَ عَدَداً,"(Then We sealed up their hearing) We cast sleep over them, such that they slept (in the Cave for a number of years) 309 years."
ثُمَّ بَعَثْنَاهُمْ لِنَعْلَمَ أَيُّ الحِزْبَيْنِ أَحْصَىٰ لِمَا لَبِثُواْ أَمَداً,(And afterward We raised them up) We woke them up just as We sent them to sleep (that We might know) We might see (which of the two parties) the believers or the disbelievers (would best calculate the time) the duration (that they had tarried) in the Cave.
نَحْنُ نَقُصُّ عَلَيْكَ نبَأَهُم بِٱلْحَقِّ إِنَّهُمْ فِتْيَةٌ آمَنُواْ بِرَبِّهِمْ وَزِدْنَاهُمْ هُدًى,"(We narrate unto thee) We exposit to you (their story with truth. Lo! they were young men who believed in their Lord, and We increased them in guidance) in insight into the matter of their religion; it is also said that this means: We made them firm in their faith."
وَرَبَطْنَا عَلَىٰ قُلُوبِهِمْ إِذْ قَامُواْ فَقَالُواْ رَبُّنَا رَبُّ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ لَن نَّدْعُوَاْ مِن دُونِهِ إِلـٰهاً لَّقَدْ قُلْنَا إِذاً شَطَطاً,"(And We made firm their hearts) We preserved their hearts with faith; it is also said that: We inspired them to hold fast to patience (when they stood forth) when they left the disbelieving emperor Decius (Duqyanus) (and said: Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth. We cry unto) we worship (no god beside Him, for then should we utter an enormity) for then we would be telling lies and falsehood about Allah."
هَـٰؤُلاۤءِ قَوْمُنَا ٱتَّخَذُواْ مِن دُونِهِ آلِهَةً لَّوْلاَ يَأْتُونَ عَلَيْهِم بِسُلْطَانٍ بَيِّنٍ فَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّنِ ٱفْتَرَىٰ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ كَذِباً,"(These, our people, have chosen (other) gods) they have worshipped idols (beside Him though they bring no clear warrant) a clear proof ((vouchsafed) to them) that Allah commanded them to worship them. (And who doth greater wrong than he who inventeth a lie concerning Allah) that He has a partner?"
وَإِذِ ٱعْتَزَلْتُمُوهُمْ وَمَا يَعْبُدُونَ إِلاَّ ٱللَّهَ فَأْوُوا إِلَى ٱلْكَهْفِ يَنْشُرْ لَكُمْ رَبُّكُم مِّن رَّحْمَتِهِ وَيُهَيِّئْ لَكُمْ مِّنْ أَمْرِكُمْ مِّرْفَقاً,"(And when ye withdraw from them) and when you leave them and their religion (and that which they worship) of idols beside Allah, therefore worship none (except Allah, then seek refuge in the Cave) enter this Cave; (your Lord will spread for you) He will bestow upon you (of His mercy) of His blessings (and will prepare for you a pillow in your plight) He will prepare for you that which will be kind towards you tomorrow. All this was said by the group of youth."
وَتَرَى ٱلشَّمْسَ إِذَا طَلَعَت تَّزَاوَرُ عَن كَهْفِهِمْ ذَاتَ ٱلْيَمِينِ وَإِذَا غَرَبَت تَّقْرِضُهُمْ ذَاتَ ٱلشِّمَالِ وَهُمْ فِي فَجْوَةٍ مِّنْهُ ذٰلِكَ مِنْ آيَاتِ ٱللَّهِ مَن يَهْدِ ٱللَّهُ فَهُوَ ٱلْمُهْتَدِ وَمَن يُضْلِلْ فَلَن تَجِدَ لَهُ وَلِيّاً مُّرْشِداً,"(And thou mightest have seen the sun when it rose move away) decline (from their cave to the right) the right of the Cave, (and when it set go past them on the left) the left of the Cave, (and they were in the cleft thereof) on a side of the Cave; it is also said that this means: they were in a space which was reached by the light of day. (That) which I have mentioned of their story (was (one) of the portents of Allah) of the marvels of Allah. (He whom Allah guideth) to His religion, (he indeed is led aright) to his religion, (and he whom He sendeth astray, for him thou wilt not find a guiding friend) who might lead him to the guidance."
وَتَحْسَبُهُمْ أَيْقَاظاً وَهُمْ رُقُودٌ وَنُقَلِّبُهُمْ ذَاتَ ٱليَمِينِ وَذَاتَ ٱلشِّمَالِ وَكَلْبُهُمْ بَاسِطٌ ذِرَاعَيْهِ بِٱلوَصِيدِ لَوِ ٱطَّلَعْتَ عَلَيْهِمْ لَوَلَّيْتَ مِنْهُمْ فِرَاراً وَلَمُلِئْتَ مِنْهُمْ رُعْباً,"(And thou wouldst have deemed them) O Muhammad (waking) not sleeping (though they were asleep, and we caused them to turn over to the right and the left) once each year so that the earth does not eat away their flesh, (and their dog) Qatmir (stretching out his paws on the threshold) at the entrance of the Cave. (If thou hadst observed them closely) in that state (thou hadst assuredly turned away from them in flight, and hadst been filled with awe of them) and you would have been sacred of them."
وَكَذٰلِكَ بَعَثْنَاهُمْ لِيَتَسَآءَلُوا بَيْنَهُمْ قَالَ قَائِلٌ مِّنْهُمْ كَم لَبِثْتُمْ قَالُواْ لَبِثْنَا يَوْماً أَوْ بَعْضَ يَوْمٍ قَالُواْ رَبُّكُمْ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا لَبِثْتُمْ فَٱبْعَثُواْ أَحَدَكُمْ بِوَرِقِكُمْ هَـٰذِهِ إِلَىٰ ٱلْمَدِينَةِ فَلْيَنْظُرْ أَيُّهَآ أَزْكَىٰ طَعَاماً فَلْيَأْتِكُمْ بِرِزْقٍ مِّنْهُ وَلْيَتَلَطَّفْ وَلاَ يُشْعِرَنَّ بِكُمْ أَحَداً,"(And in like manner We awakened them), after 309 years, (that they might question one another) so that they might talk to one another. (A speaker from among them) this is their chief and leader: Maxmillian (Maksilmina) (said: How long have ye tarried) in this Cave after you slept? (They said: We have tarried a day) and when they left the cave and saw that the sun did set yet, they said: (or some part of a day. (Others) said) i.e. Maxmillian: (Your Lord best knoweth what ye have tarried) after you slept. (Now send one of you) Yamblichus (Yamlikha) (with this your silver coin unto the city) of Ephesus (Afsus), (and let him see what food is purest there) the largest quantity; it is also said that this means: the best of bread and most lawful slaughtered meat (and bring you a supply thereof. Let him be courteous) when buying (and let no man) let no Magian (know of you) find out about you."
إِنَّهُمْ إِن يَظْهَرُواْ عَلَيْكُمْ يَرْجُمُوكُمْ أَوْ يُعِيدُوكُمْ فِي مِلَّتِهِمْ وَلَن تُفْلِحُوۤاْ إِذاً أَبَداً,"(For they, if they) the Magians (should come to know of you, will stone you) kill you (or turn you back to their religion) Zoroastrianism; (then ye will never prosper) you will never escape from Allah's punishment."

When (the people of the city) disputed of their case among themselves) when their words differed among themselves, (they said) i.e. the disbelievers said: (Build over them a building) a church because they are followers of our religion; (their Lord knoweth best concerning them. Those who won their point said) those whose argument did not prevail, i.e. the believers: (We verily shall build a place of worship over them) because they are followers of our religion; their difference being about this point."

Say) to them, O Muhammad: (My Lord is best aware of their number. None knoweth them save a few) among the believers. Ibn 'Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him and with his father, said: "" I am among those few: they were eight young men, and the dog "". (So contend not concerning them) so do not argue with them concerning the number of the sleepers of the Cave (except with an outward contending) unless you recite the Qur'an to them outwardly, (and ask not any of them to pronounce concerning them) do not ask any one of them about their number; enough is what Allah has clarified to you."

(And remember thy Lord) without exception (when thou forgettest) even if it is after a while, (and say: It may be that my Lord guideth me) and lead me (unto a nearer way of truth than this) a more correct and certain way than this. This verse was revealed about the Prophet (pbuh) for he said to the idolaters of Mecca when they asked him about the spirit: "" tomorrow, I will answer you "" , and he forgot to say "" if Allah wills ""."
وَلَبِثُواْ فِي كَهْفِهِمْ ثَلاثَ مِاْئَةٍ سِنِينَ وَٱزْدَادُواْ تِسْعاً,(And (it is said) they tarried in their Cave three hundred years and add nine) before Allah made them wake up.
قُلِ ٱللَّهُ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا لَبِثُواْ لَهُ غَيْبُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ أَبْصِرْ بِهِ وَأَسْمِعْ مَا لَهُم مِّن دُونِهِ مِن وَلِيٍّ وَلاَ يُشْرِكُ فِي حُكْمِهِ أَحَداً,"(Say) O Muhammad: (Allah is best aware how long they tarried) after that. (His is the Invisible of the heavens and the earth) His is that which is hidden from the servants. (How clear of sight is He and keen of hearing!) so hear and know what I see and know about them and their matter (They have no protecting friend beside Him) they have no one to protect them beside Allah; it is also said that this means: the people of Mecca have no close one to benefit them against Allah's chastisement, (and He maketh none to share in His government) in His dominion of the Unseen."
وَٱتْلُ مَآ أُوْحِيَ إِلَيْكَ مِن كِتَابِ رَبِّكَ لاَ مُبَدِّلَ لِكَلِمَاتِهِ وَلَن تَجِدَ مِن دُونِهِ مُلْتَحَداً,"(And recite that which hath been revealed unto thee of the Scripture of thy Lord) He says: recite to them the Qur'an, neither increasing nor decreasing anything from it. (There is none who can change His words, and thou wilt find no refuge beside Him) beside Allah."
وَٱصْبِرْ نَفْسَكَ مَعَ ٱلَّذِينَ يَدْعُونَ رَبَّهُم بِٱلْغَدَاةِ وَٱلْعَشِيِّ يُرِيدُونَ وَجْهَهُ وَلاَ تَعْدُ عَيْنَاكَ عَنْهُمْ تُرِيدُ زِينَةَ ٱلْحَيَاةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَلاَ تُطِعْ مَنْ أَغْفَلْنَا قَلْبَهُ عَن ذِكْرِنَا وَٱتَّبَعَ هَوَاهُ وَكَانَ أَمْرُهُ فُرُطاً,"(Restrain thyself along with those who cry unto their Lord) who worship their Lord (at morn and evening) the reference here is to Salman al-Farisi and his fellow believers, (seeking His Countenance) by worshipping Him they seek only Allah's Countenance and good pleasure; (and let not your eyes overlook them, desiring the pomp of the life of the world) the embellishment of this worldly life; (and obey not him whose heart We have made heedless of Our remembrance) of Our divine Oneness, (who followeth his own lust) by worshipping the idols (and whose case) and whose words (hath been abandoned) at a loss. This verse was revealed about 'Uyaynah Ibn Hisn al-Fazari."
وَقُلِ ٱلْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّكُمْ فَمَن شَآءَ فَلْيُؤْمِن وَمَن شَآءَ فَلْيَكْفُرْ إِنَّا أَعْتَدْنَا لِلظَّالِمِينَ نَاراً أَحَاطَ بِهِمْ سُرَادِقُهَا وَإِن يَسْتَغِيثُواْ يُغَاثُواْ بِمَآءٍ كَٱلْمُهْلِ يَشْوِي ٱلْوجُوهَ بِئْسَ ٱلشَّرَابُ وَسَآءَتْ مُرْتَفَقاً,"(Say) to 'Uyaynah: ((It is) the Truth) there is no deity except Allah (from the Lord of you (all). Then whosoever will, let him believe, and whosoever will, let him disbelieve) this is a threat from Allah; it is also said that this means: for whomever Allah wants faith, he will believe; and for whomever He does not want faith, he will not believe. (Lo! We have prepared for disbelievers) for 'Uyaynah and his host (Fire. Its tent encloseth them) the extent of the Fire surrounds them. (If they ask for showers) if they ask for water to drink, (they will be showered with water like molten lead) like boiling oil or hot liquid silver (which burneth the faces. Calamitous the drink and ill the resting place!) evil is their dwelling; He says: evil is the abode of their companions: the satans and the disbelievers."
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ إِنَّا لاَ نُضِيعُ أَجْرَ مَنْ أَحْسَنَ عَمَلاً,"(Lo! as for those who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an (and do good works) between them and their Lord, (Lo! We suffer not the reward of one whose work is goodly to be lost) We thwart not the reward of him whose works are sincere."
أُوْلَـٰئِكَ لَهُمْ جَنَّاتُ عَدْنٍ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهِمُ ٱلأَنْهَارُ يُحَلَّوْنَ فِيهَا مِنْ أَسَاوِرَ مِن ذَهَبٍ وَيَلْبَسُونَ ثِيَاباً خُضْراً مِّن سُنْدُسٍ وَإِسْتَبْرَقٍ مُّتَّكِئِينَ فِيهَا عَلَى ٱلأَرَآئِكِ نِعْمَ ٱلثَّوَابُ وَحَسُنَتْ مُرْتَفَقاً,"(As for such, theirs will be Gardens of Eden) the compartment of the All-Merciful, (wherein rivers) rivers of wine, water, honey and milk (flow beneath them) i.e. beneath their trees and habitations; (therein) in Paradise (they will be given armlets of gold and will wear green robes of finest silk and gold embroidery, reclining upon) sitting in Paradise on (thrones therein) on canopies. (Blest the reward) in Paradise, (and fair the resting place!) He says: fair is the abode: the abode of their companions: the prophets and righteous."
وَٱضْرِبْ لهُمْ مَّثَلاً رَّجُلَيْنِ جَعَلْنَا لأَحَدِهِمَا جَنَّتَيْنِ مِنْ أَعْنَابٍ وَحَفَفْنَاهُمَا بِنَخْلٍ وَجَعَلْنَا بَيْنَهُمَا زَرْعاً,"(Coin for them a similitude) explain to the people of Mecca, the description of: (Two men) two brothers from the Children of Israel, one of whom is a believer, Yehuda, and the other a disbeliever, Abufatrus, (unto one of whom) the disbeliever (We had assigned two gardens of grapes, and We had surrounded both with date-palms and had put between them) between the gardens (tillage) a plantation."
كِلْتَا ٱلْجَنَّتَيْنِ آتَتْ أُكُلَهَا وَلَمْ تَظْلِم مِّنْهُ شَيْئاً وَفَجَّرْنَا خِلالَهُمَا نَهَراً,(Each of the gardens gave its fruit) every year (and withheld naught thereof. And We caused a river to gush forth therein) in their middle.
وَكَانَ لَهُ ثَمَرٌ فَقَالَ لِصَاحِبِهِ وَهُوَ يُحَاوِرُهُ أَنَا أَكْثَرُ مِنكَ مَالاً وَأَعَزُّ نَفَراً,"(And he had fruit) the garden had fruits; or according to a different reading: wealth. (And he said unto his comrade) the believer: Yehuda, (when he spake with him) bragging to him about his wealth: (I am more than thee in wealth, and stronger about men) I have more servants."
وَدَخَلَ جَنَّتَهُ وَهُوَ ظَالِمٌ لِّنَفْسِهِ قَالَ مَآ أَظُنُّ أَن تَبِيدَ هَـٰذِهِ أَبَداً,"(And he went into his garden, while he (thus) wronged himself) through his disbelief. (He said: I think not that all this will ever perish)."
وَمَآ أَظُنُّ ٱلسَّاعَةَ قَائِمَةً وَلَئِن رُّدِدتُّ إِلَىٰ رَبِّي لأَجِدَنَّ خَيْراً مِّنْهَا مُنْقَلَباً,"(I think not that the Hour will ever come) will ever take place, (and if indeed I am brought back unto my Lord) as you claim (I surely shall find better than this) garden (as a resort) as a returning place."
قَالَ لَهُ صَاحِبُهُ وَهُوَ يُحَاوِرُهُ أَكَفَرْتَ بِٱلَّذِي خَلَقَكَ مِن تُرَابٍ ثُمَّ مِن نُّطْفَةٍ ثُمَّ سَوَّاكَ رَجُلاً,"(And his comrade) the believer, (while he disputed with him) such that he may renounce his disbelief, (exclaimed: Disbelievest thou in Him Who created thee of dust) He created you from Adam and Adam is from dust, (then of a drop (of seed)) of your father, (and then fashioned you a man) of an upright stature?"
لَّٰكِنَّاْ هُوَ ٱللَّهُ رَبِّي وَلاَ أُشْرِكُ بِرَبِّي أَحَداً,"(But) I say (He is Allah, my Lord) my Creator and Provider, (and I ascribe unto my Lord no partner) among idols."
وَلَوْلاۤ إِذْ دَخَلْتَ جَنَّتَكَ قُلْتَ مَا شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ لاَ قُوَّةَ إِلاَّ بِٱللَّهِ إِن تَرَنِ أَنَاْ أَقَلَّ مِنكَ مَالاً وَوَلَداً,"(If only, when thou enteredst thy garden, thou hadst said: That which Allah willeth (will come to pass)!) this is from Allah and not from me. (There is no strength save in Allah!) this is only through Allah's power, not through my own power. (Though thou seest me as less than you in wealth and children) and servants in the life of this world."
فعسَىٰ رَبِّي أَن يُؤْتِيَنِ خَيْراً مِّن جَنَّتِكَ وَيُرْسِلَ عَلَيْهَا حُسْبَاناً مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ فَتُصْبِحَ صَعِيداً زَلَقاً,"(Yet it may be) 'may be' when used in connection to Allah denotes a requisite (that my Lord will give me) in the Hereafter (better than your garden) in the life of this world, (and will send on it) on your garden (a bolt) of fire (from heaven, and some morning it will be a smooth hillside) smooth dust,"
أَوْ يُصْبِحَ مَآؤُهَا غَوْراً فَلَن تَسْتَطِيعَ لَهُ طَلَباً,"(Or some morning the water thereof) the water of the garden (will be lost in the earth) will sink in the earth, out of reach (so that thou canst not make search for it) so that you cannot access it."

(Then began he to wring his hands) out of regret (for all that he had spent upon it) upon the garden; it is also said that this means: upon all the fruits it contained, (when (now) it was all ruined on its trellises, and to say) on the Day of Judgement: (Would that I had ascribed no partner to my Lord!) would that I had ascribed no idols to my Lord!"
وَلَمْ تَكُن لَّهُ فِئَةٌ يَنصُرُونَهُ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ وَمَا كَانَ مُنْتَصِراً,"(And he had no troop of men to help him as against Allah) i.e. against Allah's punishment, (nor could he save himself) from Allah's punishment."

Likewise, the life of this world will vanish and nothing of its adornment will remain. (Allah is Able to do all things) He is Able to make the life of this world vanish and the Hereafter subsist."
ٱلْمَالُ وَٱلْبَنُونَ زِينَةُ ٱلْحَيَاةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَٱلْبَاقِيَاتُ ٱلصَّالِحَاتُ خَيْرٌ عِندَ رَبِّكَ ثَوَاباً وَخَيْرٌ أَمَلاً,"Allah then mentions the comfort that the life of this world contains, saying: (Wealth and children are an ornament of life of the world) but they do not last just as dry twigs do not. (But the good deeds which endure) the five daily prayers; it is also said that the reference here is to: that which is lasting in reward. Good deeds include the saying of: "" Glory be to Allah, praise be to Allah, there is no deity save Allah and Allah is the greatest "" , (are better in thy Lord's sight for reward) for recompense, (and better about hope) the prayer is the best work by means of which the servants can be helpful."
وَيَوْمَ نُسَيِّرُ ٱلْجِبَالَ وَتَرَى ٱلأَرْضَ بَارِزَةً وَحَشَرْنَاهُمْ فَلَمْ نُغَادِرْ مِنْهُمْ أَحَداً,"(And (bethink you of) the Day when We remove the hills) from the face of the earth (and ye see the earth emerging) from beneath mountains, (and We gather them) for the Resurrection (together so as to leave not one of them behind)."

(But you thought) you said in the life of the world (that We had set no tryst for you) that We had set no appointed term for the Resurrection."

(And they find all that they did) of good or evil (confronting them) written down, (and thy Lord wrongeth no one) He does not decrease the good deeds of anyone nor increase the evil deeds of anyone; it is also said that this means: He does not diminish the good deeds of the believer nor leave the evil deeds of the unbeliever."

(Will ye choose him) will you worship him (and his seed for your protecting friends) as lords (instead of Me) instead of Allah, (when they are an enemy unto you) whose enmity is quite manifest? (Calamitous is the exchange) in worship; it is also said that this means: evil is that which they exchanged: they exchanged the worship of Allah with the worship of Satan; and it is also said: they exchanged the protecting friendship of Allah with the protecting friendship of Satan (for evil-doers) for idolaters!"
مَّآ أَشْهَدتُّهُمْ خَلْقَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَلاَ خَلْقَ أَنْفُسِهِمْ وَمَا كُنتُ مُتَّخِذَ ٱلْمُضِلِّينَ عَضُداً,"(I made them not) i.e. the angels and the satans (to witness the creation of the heavens and the earth) when I created them, (nor their own creation) when I created them; it is also said that this means: I did not seek the help of angels and satans to create the heavens and the earth or to create them; (nor choose I misleaders) the disbelievers, the Jews, Christians and idol worshippers (for (My) helpers)."
وَيَوْمَ يَقُولُ نَادُواْ شُرَكَآئِيَ ٱلَّذِينَ زَعَمْتُمْ فَدَعَوْهُمْ فَلَمْ يَسْتَجِيبُواْ لَهُمْ وَجَعَلْنَا بَيْنَهُم مَّوْبِقاً,"(And (be mindful of) the Day) which is the Day of Judgement (when He will say) to idol worshippers: (Call those partners of Mine) i.e. your deities (whom ye pretended) whom you worshipped and claimed they were My partners so that they defend you against my chastisement. (Then they will cry unto them, but they will not hear their prayer) they did not respond to them, (and We shall set a gulf of doom between them) We shall set a valley of fire between the worshippers and those who were worshipped; it is also said that this means: We set destruction between them in the Hereafter instead of the love and affection which was between them in the life of this world."
وَرَأَى ٱلْمُجْرِمُونَ ٱلنَّارَ فَظَنُّوۤاْ أَنَّهُمْ مُّوَاقِعُوهَا وَلَمْ يَجِدُواْ عَنْهَا مَصْرِفاً,"(And the guilty) and the idolaters (behold the Fire and know) and are ascertained (that they are about to fall therein) that they shall enter the Fire, (and they find no way of escape thence):"

(Those who disbelieve) in the scriptures and messengers (contend with falsehood) with idolatry (in order to refute) to nullify (the Truth) and guidance (thereby. And they take Our revelations) Our scriptures and messengers (and that wherewith they are threatened) of chastisement (as a jest) and mockery.

(Lo! on their hearts We have placed coverings so that they understand not) the Truth and guidance, (and in their ears a deafness) so that they hear not the Truth and guidance. (And though thou) O Muhammad (call them to the guidance) to Allah's divine Oneness, (in that case they can never be led aright) they will not believe."

It so happened that it came to Moses's mind that there is no servant on the face of the earth who is more knowledgeable than him. And so Allah said to Moses: "" I have a servant on earth who is more obedient to Me and more knowledgeable than you, and this servant is Khidr "". Moses said: "" O Lord! Guide me to him "". He said: "" Take with you salted fish and walk along the sea shores until you find a rock in which there is the fountain of life. Sprinkle some of the water on the fish until it comes back to life. There you will meet Khidr "". Allah said: (And when Moses said unto his servant) his servant was Shajardah Joshua ben Nun, an Israelite nobleman. He was his servant in the sense that he kept his company and served him: (I will not give up until I reach the point where the two rivers meet) where sea water meets with river water, i.e. where the Persian Gulf and the Mediterranean Sea meet, (though I march on for ages) or I will continue going on for years."
فَلَمَّا بَلَغَا مَجْمَعَ بَيْنِهِمَا نَسِيَا حُوتَهُمَا فَٱتَّخَذَ سَبِيلَهُ فِي ٱلْبَحْرِ سَرَباً,"(And when they reached the point where the two met) between the two seas, (they forgot their fish) they forgot the matter of their fish, (and it took its way into the waters, being free)."
فَلَمَّا جَاوَزَا قَالَ لِفَتَٰهُ آتِنَا غَدَآءَنَا لَقَدْ لَقِينَا مِن سَفَرِنَا هَـٰذَا نَصَباً,"(And when they had gone further) from the rock, (he said unto his servant) Shajardah: (Bring us our breakfast. Verily we have found fatigue in this our journey)."
قَالَ أَرَأَيْتَ إِذْ أَوَيْنَآ إِلَى ٱلصَّخْرَةِ فَإِنِّي نَسِيتُ ٱلْحُوتَ وَمَآ أَنْسَانِيهُ إِلاَّ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنُ أَنْ أَذْكُرَهُ وَٱتَّخَذَ سَبِيلَهُ فِي ٱلْبَحْرِ عَجَباً,"(He said) Joshua said: (Didst thou see) O Moses, (when we took refuge on the rock, and I forgot the fish) the matter of the fish (and none but Satan caused me to forget to mention it) to you, (it took its way into the waters by a marvel) it was dry land."
قَالَ ذَلِكَ مَا كُنَّا نَبْغِ فَٱرْتَدَّا عَلَىٰ آثَارِهِمَا قَصَصاً,"(He said) Moses said: (This is that which we have been seeking) as an indication from Allah to Khidr (they retraced their steps again) they went back, following their own footsteps."
فَوَجَدَا عَبْداً مِّنْ عِبَادِنَآ آتَيْنَاهُ رَحْمَةً مِّنْ عِندِنَا وَعَلَّمْنَاهُ مِن لَّدُنَّا عِلْماً,"(Then found they) at the rock (one of Our slaves) i.e. Khidr, (unto whom We had given mercy from Us) He says: We favoured him with prophethood, (and had taught him knowledge from Our presence) the knowledge of future events."
قَالَ لَهُ مُوسَىٰ هَلْ أَتَّبِعُكَ عَلَىٰ أَن تُعَلِّمَنِ مِمَّا عُلِّمْتَ رُشْداً,"(Moses said unto him: May I follow thee) may I keep your company, (to the end that thou mayst teach me right conduct of that which thou hast been taught) that you may teach me guidance and that which is right?"
قَالَ إِنَّكَ لَن تَسْتَطِيعَ مَعِيَ صَبْراً,(He said) O Moses: (Lo! thou canst not bear with me) for you may see me doing something that you will not be able to bear.
وَكَيْفَ تَصْبِرُ عَلَىٰ مَا لَمْ تُحِطْ بِهِ خُبْراً,"When Moses said he will be able to bear anything, Khidr said: (How canst thou) O Moses (bear with that whereof thou canst not compass any knowledge) that the explanation of which you have not been given?"
قَالَ سَتَجِدُنِيۤ إِن شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ صَابِراً وَلاَ أَعْصِي لَكَ أمْراً,"(He said: Allah willing, thou shalt find me) O Khidr (patient) in relation to that which I see from you (and I shall not in aught gainsay thee) I will not disobey your command."
قَالَ فَإِنِ ٱتَّبَعْتَنِي فَلاَ تَسْأَلْني عَن شَيءٍ حَتَّىٰ أُحْدِثَ لَكَ مِنْهُ ذِكْراً,"(He said) Khidr said: (Well, if thou go with me) if you keep my company, O Moses, (ask me not concerning aught) about what I do (till I myself mention of it unto you) until I proceed to explain it to you."
فَٱنْطَلَقَا حَتَّىٰ إِذَا رَكِبَا فِي ٱلسَّفِينَةِ خَرَقَهَا قَالَ أَخَرَقْتَهَا لِتُغْرِقَ أَهْلَهَا لَقَدْ جِئْتَ شَيْئاً إِمْراً,"(So the twain set out) so both Khidr and Moses (pbut) set out (till, when they were in the ship) to cross over, (he made a hole therein) Khidr made a hole in the ship. ((Moses) said) to him: (Hast thou made a hole therein to drown the folk thereof? Thou verily hast done a dreadful thing) towards the people of the ship."
قَالَ أَلَمْ أَقُلْ إِنَّكَ لَن تَسْتَطِيعَ مَعِيَ صَبْراً,(He said) Khidr said to him: (Did I not tell thee) O Moses (thou couldst not bear with me?)
قَالَ لاَ تُؤَاخِذْنِي بِمَا نَسِيتُ وَلاَ تُرْهِقْنِي مِنْ أَمْرِي عُسْراً,"((Moses) said: Be not wroth with me that I forgot) your advice, (and be not hard upon me for my fault) do not tax me severely for my fault."
فَٱنْطَلَقَا حَتَّىٰ إِذَا لَقِيَا غُلاَماً فَقَتَلَهُ قَالَ أَقَتَلْتَ نَفْساً زَكِيَّةً بِغَيْرِ نَفْسٍ لَّقَدْ جِئْتَ شَيْئاً نُّكْراً,"(So the twain journeyed on till, when they met a lad) between two townships, (he slew him) Khidr killed him. ((Moses) said: What! Hast thou) O Khidr (slain an innocent soul who hath slain no man? Verily thou hast done a horrid thing) you have committed a horrendous, evil act."
قَالَ أَلَمْ أَقُلْ لَّكَ إِنَّكَ لَن تَسْتَطِيعَ مَعِيَ صَبْراً,(He said) Khidr said: (Did I not tell thee) O Moses (that thou couldst not bear with me? Did I not tell you that you might see me doing something that you will not be able to tolerate?
قَالَ إِن سَأَلْتُكَ عَن شَيْءٍ بَعْدَهَا فَلاَ تُصَٰحِبْنِي قَدْ بَلَغْتَ مِن لَّدُنِّي عُذْراً,"((Moses) said: If I ask thee) O Khidr (after this) after killing this soul (concerning aught, keep not company with me. Thou hast received an excuse from me) you have an excuse to part company with me."
فَٱنطَلَقَا حَتَّىٰ إِذَآ أَتَيَآ أَهْلَ قَرْيَةٍ ٱسْتَطْعَمَآ أَهْلَهَا فَأَبَوْاْ أَن يُضَيِّفُوهُمَا فَوَجَدَا فِيهَا جِدَاراً يُرِيدُ أَن يَنقَضَّ فَأَقَامَهُ قَالَ لَوْ شِئْتَ لَتَّخَذْتَ عَلَيْهِ أَجْراً,"(So they twain journeyed on till, when they came unto the folk of a certain township) Antioch, (they asked its folk for food) they asked its inhabitants for bread, (but they refused to make them guests) they refused to give them food. (And they found therein a wall upon the point of falling into ruin, and he repaired it) Khidr repaired it. ((Moses) said: If thou hadst wished) O Khidr, (thou couldst have taken payment for it) in the form of bread that we could eat."
قَالَ هَـٰذَا فِرَاقُ بَيْنِي وَبَيْنِكَ سَأُنَبِّئُكَ بِتَأْوِيلِ مَا لَمْ تَسْتَطِع عَّلَيْهِ صَبْراً,(He said) Khidr said: (This is the parting between thee and me) O Moses! (I will announce unto thee the interpretation of that thou couldst not bear with patience).
أَمَّا ٱلسَّفِينَةُ فَكَانَتْ لِمَسَاكِينَ يَعْمَلُونَ فِي ٱلْبَحْرِ فَأَرَدتُّ أَنْ أَعِيبَهَا وَكَانَ وَرَآءَهُم مَّلِكٌ يَأْخُذُ كُلَّ سَفِينَةٍ غَصْباً,"(As for the ship) in which I made a hole, (it belonged to poor people working on the river) transporting people across the river, (and I wished to mar it) I wished to damage it, (for there was a king) called Jalandi (behind them) ahead of them (who is taking every ship by force) and this is why I damaged it."
وَأَمَّا ٱلْغُلاَمُ فَكَانَ أَبَوَاهُ مُؤْمِنَيْنِ فَخَشِينَآ أَن يُرْهِقَهُمَا طُغْيَاناً وَكُفْراً,"(And as for the lad) whom I killed, (his parents were believers) and of the greatest people of that township (and We feared lest he should oppress them) and your Lord Knew that he will overburden them (by rebellion and disbelief) by means of his rebellion and disobedience, and by lying in oath and so He killed him."
فَأَرَدْنَآ أَن يُبْدِلَهُمَا رَبُّهُمَا خَيْراً مِّنْهُ زَكَـاةً وَأَقْرَبَ رُحْماً,"(And We intended that their Lord should change him for them for one) another child (better in purity) righteous (and nearer to mercy) who is more keen to keep ties of kinship. Allah gave them instead of him a girl who later married a prophet and from whom she gave birth to a prophet at whose hand a great number of people were guided. The son killed by Khidr, whose name was Jaysur, was, on the other hand, a disbeliever, a thief and a murderer. This is why Khidr killed him."
وَأَمَّا ٱلْجِدَارُ فَكَانَ لِغُلاَمَيْنِ يَتِيمَيْنِ فِي ٱلْمَدِينَةِ وَكَانَ تَحْتَهُ كَنزٌ لَّهُمَا وَكَانَ أَبُوهُمَا صَالِحاً فَأَرَادَ رَبُّكَ أَن يَبْلُغَآ أَشُدَّهُمَا وَيَسْتَخْرِجَا كَنزَهُمَا رَحْمَةً مِّن رَّبِّكَ وَمَا فَعَلْتُهُ عَنْ أَمْرِي ذَلِكَ تَأْوِيلُ مَا لَمْ تَسْطِـع عَّلَيْهِ صَبْراً,"(And as for the wall) which I repaired, (it belonged to two orphan boys) called Asram and Suraym (in the city) of Antioch, (and there was beneath it a treasure belonging to them) it was a tablet of gold containing knowledge and wisdom and written on it: “In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. I am really amazed regarding a person who believes in death: how could he ever be happy; and amazed at a person who believes in the evanescence of this worldly life and the fluctuation of its people: how he can find tranquillity in it; there is no deity except Allah and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah (pbuh)” (and their father had been righteous) he was a trustworthy man called Kashih, (and your Lord intended that they should come to their full strength) that they should reach the age of puberty (and should bring forth their treasure) i.e. their golden tablet (as a mercy from their Lord) as a blessing from your Lord; it is also said that this means: as an inspiration from your Lord; (and I did it not upon my own command) I did not do it from my own initiative. (Such is the interpretation of that wherewith thou couldst not bear)."
وَيَسْأَلُونَكَ عَن ذِي ٱلْقَرْنَيْنِ قُلْ سَأَتْلُواْ عَلَيْكُم مِّنْهُ ذِكْراً,"(They) the people of Mecca (will ask thee) O Muhammad (of Dhu'l-Qarnayn) about the event of Dhu'l-Qarnayn. (Say) to them, O Muhammad: (I shall recite unto you a remembrance of him) I shall recite to you an explanation of his event."
إِنَّا مَكَّنَّا لَهُ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَآتَيْنَاهُ مِن كُلِّ شَيْءٍ سَبَباً,(Lo! We made him strong in the land and gave unto every thing a road) the knowledge of the roads and constellation.
فَأَتْبَعَ سَبَباً,"(And he followed a road) he set out on a road,"
حَتَّىٰ إِذَا بَلَغَ مَغْرِبَ ٱلشَّمْسِ وَجَدَهَا تَغْرُبُ فِي عَيْنٍ حَمِئَةٍ وَوَجَدَ عِندَهَا قَوْماً قُلْنَا يٰذَا ٱلْقَرْنَيْنِ إِمَّآ أَن تُعَذِّبَ وَإِمَّآ أَن تَتَّخِذَ فِيهِمْ حُسْناً,"(Till, when he reached the setting place of the sun) where the sun sets, (he found it setting in a muddy spring) a blackened, muddy and stinking spring; it is also said that this means: a hot spring, (and found a people thereabout) these people were disbelievers: (We said: O Dhu'l-Qarnayn!) We inspired him (Either punish) either kill them until they accept to believe that there is no deity except Allah (or show them kindness) or you pardon them and let them be."
قَالَ أَمَّا مَن ظَلَمَ فَسَوْفَ نُعَذِّبُهُ ثُمَّ يُرَدُّ إِلَىٰ رَبِّهِ فَيُعَذِّبُهُ عَذَاباً نُّكْراً,"(He said: As for him who doth wrong) as for him who disbelieves in Allah, (we shall punish him) in this worldly life by killing him, (and then he will be brought back unto his Lord) in the Hereafter, (who will punish him) by means of the Fire (with awful punishment!) with a severe punishment."
وَأَمَّا مَنْ آمَنَ وَعَمِلَ صَالِحاً فَلَهُ جَزَآءً ٱلْحُسْنَىٰ وَسَنَقُولُ لَهُ مِنْ أَمْرِنَا يُسْراً,"(But as for him who believeth) in Allah (and doeth right) sincerely to Allah, (good will be his reward) Paradise will be his reward in the Hereafter, (and We shall speak unto him a mild command) we shall speak to him in a kind manner."
ثُمَّ أَتْبَعَ سَبَباً,(Then he followed a road) toward the East.
حَتَّىٰ إِذَا بَلَغَ مَطْلِعَ ٱلشَّمْسِ وَجَدَهَا تَطْلُعُ عَلَىٰ قَوْمٍ لَّمْ نَجْعَل لَّهُمْ مِّن دُونِهَا سِتْراً,"(Till, when he reached the rising place of the sun, he found it rising on a people for whom We had appointed no helper therefrom) these people had no shelter to protect them from the sun, they had no mountains, trees or clothes. They were naked creatures who were blind to the Truth."
كَذَلِكَ وَقَدْ أَحَطْنَا بِمَا لَدَيْهِ خُبْراً,"(So (it was)) just as he reached the West, so did he reach the East. (And We knew all concerning him) We knew what he had of information and exposition."
ثُمَّ أَتْبَعَ سَبَباً,"(Then he followed a road) he set out towards the East, to Byzantium."
حَتَّىٰ إِذَا بَلَغَ بَيْنَ السَّدَّيْنِ وَجَدَ مِن دُونِهِمَا قَوْماً لاَّ يَكَادُونَ يَفْقَهُونَ قَوْلاً,"(Till, when he came between the two mountains, he found upon their hither side) between the two mountains (a folk that scarce could understand a saying) from other people."
قَالُواْ يٰذَا ٱلْقَرْنَيْنِ إِنَّ يَأْجُوجَ وَمَأْجُوجَ مُفْسِدُونَ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ فَهَلْ نَجْعَلُ لَكَ خَرْجاً عَلَىٰ أَن تَجْعَلَ بَيْنَنَا وَبَيْنَهُمْ سَدّاً,"(They said) to the interpreter: (O Dhu'l-Qarnayn! Lo! Gog and Magog are spoiling the land) they are destroying our land, they eat our dates, loot our crops and kill our offspring; it is also said that this means: they devour people, for Gog and Magog were two men from the descendent of the children of Yapheth; it is also said that they were called Gog and Magog due to their sheer number. (So may we pay thee tribute) a reward; and it is also said that this means a wage, according to a different reading, (on condition that thou set a barrier between us and them?)"
قَالَ مَا مَكَّنِّي فِيهِ رَبِّي خَيْرٌ فَأَعِينُونِي بِقُوَّةٍ أَجْعَلْ بَيْنَكُمْ وَبَيْنَهُمْ رَدْماً,"(He said: That wherein my Lord hath established me) the dominion that my Lord has given me is (better) than your reward or wage. (Do but help me with strength) they said: “which strength do you want from us” and he said: “the strength of blacksmiths”, (I will set between you and them a bank) a barrier."
آتُونِي زُبَرَ ٱلْحَدِيدِ حَتَّىٰ إِذَا سَاوَىٰ بَيْنَ ٱلصَّدَفَيْنِ قَالَ ٱنفُخُواْ حَتَّىٰ إِذَا جَعَلَهُ نَاراً قَالَ آتُونِيۤ أُفْرِغْ عَلَيْهِ قِطْراً,"(Give me pieces of iron till, when he had levelled up (the gap) between the cliffs, he said: Blow!) and so they blew into the Fire (till, when he had made it a fire) He says: when the iron became as hot as the Fire and thus melted, (he said: Bring me molten copper to pour thereon) to pour on the wall."
فَمَا ٱسْطَاعُوۤاْ أَن يَظْهَرُوهُ وَمَا ٱسْتَطَاعُواْ لَهُ نَقْباً,"(And (Gog and Magog) were not able to surmount) to climb over it, (nor could they pierce (it)) from beneath."
قَالَ هَـٰذَا رَحْمَةٌ مِّن رَّبِّي فَإِذَا جَآءَ وَعْدُ رَبِّي جَعَلَهُ دَكَّآءَ وَكَانَ وَعْدُ رَبِّي حَقّاً,"(He said: This) wall (is a mercy from my Lord) to you; (but when the promise of my Lord cometh to pass) and Gog and Magog break free, (He will lay it low) He will break it, (for the promise of my Lord) that they will break free (is true) and this will surely take place."
وَتَرَكْنَا بَعْضَهُمْ يَوْمَئِذٍ يَمُوجُ فِي بَعْضٍ وَنُفِخَ فِي ٱلصُّورِ فَجَمَعْنَاهُمْ جَمْعاً,"(And on that day) the day when Gog and Magog break free; and it is also said: the day of return from Byzantium in that they were not able to defeat it, (We shall let some of them surge against others, and the Trumpet will be blown. Then We shall gather them together in one gathering)."
وَعَرَضْنَا جَهَنَّمَ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْكَافِرِينَ عَرْضاً,"(On that day) the Day of Judgement (We shall present hell) We shall reveal hell (to the disbelievers) before they enter it, (plain to view) clear for them to see,"
ٱلَّذِينَ كَانَتْ أَعْيُنُهُمْ فِي غِطَآءٍ عَن ذِكْرِي وَكَانُواْ لاَ يَسْتَطِيعُونَ سَمْعاً,"(Those whose eyes were hoodwinked) those whose eyes were blind (from My reminder) to My divine Oneness and Scripture, (and who could not bear to hear) the recitation of the Qur'an due to their hatred of the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh)."
أَفَحَسِبَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوۤاْ أَن يَتَّخِذُواْ عِبَادِي مِن دُونِيۤ أَوْلِيَآءَ إِنَّآ أَعْتَدْنَا جَهَنَّمَ لِلْكَافِرِينَ نُزُلاً,(Do the disbelievers) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an (reckon that they can choose My bondmen) can worship My servants (as protecting friends beside Me?) think that they can choose my servants as deities beside Me; thinking that they will help them in this life and in the Hereafter? It is also said that this means: is it enough that the disbelievers choose to worship My servants as deities? (Lo! We have prepared hell as a welcome for the disbelievers).
قُلْ هَلْ نُنَبِّئُكُم بِٱلأَخْسَرِينَ أَعْمَالاً,(Say) O Muhammad: (Shall We inform you who will be the greatest losers by their works) in the Hereafter?
ٱلَّذِينَ ضَلَّ سَعْيُهُمْ فِي ٱلْحَيَاةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَهُمْ يَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّهُمْ يُحْسِنُونَ صُنْعاً,"(Those whose effort goeth astray) those whose works are thwarted (in the life of the world) these are the Kharijites; and it is also said that this refers to anchorites, (and yet they reckon that they do good work) and yet think that they are doing righteous works."
أُوْلَـٰئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ بِآيَاتِ رَبِّهِمْ وَلِقَائِهِ فَحَبِطَتْ أَعْمَالُهُمْ فَلاَ نُقِيمُ لَهُمْ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ وَزْناً,"(Those are they who disbelieve in the revelations of their Lord) they disbelieve in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an, (and in the meeting with Him) i.e. in resurrection after death. (Therefore their works) their good works (are vain) are thwarted, (and on the Day of Resurrection We assign no weight to them) to their works; it is also said that this means: not an atom weight of their works will be weighed on the Day of Judgement."
ذَلِكَ جَزَآؤُهُمْ جَهَنَّمُ بِمَا كَفَرُواْ وَٱتَّخَذُوۤاْ آيَاتِي وَرُسُلِي هُزُواً,"(That is their reward: hell, because they disbelieved) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an, (and made a jest) and mockery (of Our revelations) Our Scripture (and Our messengers) Muhammad (pbuh) and others."
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ كَانَتْ لَهُمْ جَنَّاتُ ٱلْفِرْدَوْسِ نُزُلاً,"(Lo! those who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an (and do good works) acts of obedience, secretly between themselves and their Lord, (theirs are the Gardens of Paradise) the highest rank therein, (for welcome) as a dwelling for them,"
خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا لاَ يَبْغُونَ عَنْهَا حِوَلاً,"(Wherein they will abide, with no desire to be removed from thence) to another place."
قُل لَّوْ كَانَ ٱلْبَحْرُ مِدَاداً لِّكَلِمَاتِ رَبِّي لَنَفِدَ ٱلْبَحْرُ قَبْلَ أَن تَنفَدَ كَلِمَاتُ رَبِّي وَلَوْ جِئْنَا بِمِثْلِهِ مَدَداً,"(Say) O Muhammad to the Jews: (Though the sea became ink for the Words of my Lord) for the knowledge of my Lord, (verily the sea would be used up before the Words of my Lord were exhausted) it is also said that 'the Words of my Lord' means: the disposition of my Lord, (even though We brought the like thereof to help) as an addition."
قُلْ إِنَّمَآ أَنَاْ بَشَرٌ مِّثْلُكُمْ يُوحَىٰ إِلَيَّ أَنَّمَآ إِلَـٰهُكُمْ إِلَـٰهٌ وَاحِدٌ فَمَن كَانَ يَرْجُواْ لِقَآءَ رَبِّهِ فَلْيَعْمَلْ عَمَلاً صَالِحاً وَلاَ يُشْرِكْ بِعِبَادَةِ رَبِّهِ أَحَدَاً,"(Say) O Muhammad: (I am only a mortal like you) I am a human being like you. (My Lord inspireth in me) through Gabriel (that your God is only One God) and He has no son or partner. (And whoever hopeth for the meeting with his Lord) whoever fears resurrection after death, (let him do righteous work) sincerely, and secretly between him and his Lord, (and make none sharer of the worship due unto his Lord) he should not show off or associate in the worship of his Lord anything or anyone; it is also said that this means: he should not associate in his obedience of his Lord anything or anyone. This verse was revealed about Jundub Ibn Zuhayr al-'Amiri'."
كۤهيعۤصۤ,"And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said regarding the interpretation of (Kaf. Ha. Ya. Ain. Sad): '(Kaf. Ha. Ya. 'Ayn. Sad.) this is an expression of praise with which Allah praised Himself. He says: Kaf means He is Sufficient (Kafi), Ha means He is the guiding One (Hadi), 'Ayn means He is Possessor of knowledge ('Alim), and Sad means He is Possessor of Truth (Sadiq); it is also said that Kaf means He is Sufficient unto His servants, Ha means He guides His servants, Ya means His hand is above His creation, and 'Ayn means He knows the affairs of His servants, and Sad means He is true in His promise. It is also said that Kaf is from the Generous (Karim), Ha is from the One who guides (Hadi), Ya is from Clement (Halim), 'Ayn from the One who possesses knowledge ('Alim), and Sad from the Truthful (Sadiq), or from the Veracious (Sudduq). It is also said that (Kaf. Ha. Ya. Ain. Sad) is an oath by means of which Allah swore."
ذِكْرُ رَحْمَتِ رَبِّكَ عَبْدَهُ زَكَرِيَّآ,(A mention of the mercy of your Lord) He says: this a mention of your Lord (unto His servant Zachariah) His mercy unto him was by giving him a son.
إِذْ نَادَىٰ رَبَّهُ نِدَآءً خَفِيّاً,"(When he cried unto his Lord) Zachariah called his Lord in the sanctuary (a cry in secret) in secret from his people,"
قَالَ رَبِّ إِنَّي وَهَنَ ٱلْعَظْمُ مِنِّي وَٱشْتَعَلَ ٱلرَّأْسُ شَيْباً وَلَمْ أَكُنْ بِدُعَآئِكَ رَبِّ شَقِيّاً,"(Saying: My Lord!) O my Lord! (Lo! the bones of me wax feeble) my body has become weak (and my head is shining with grey hair, and I have never been unblest in prayer to You, my Lord) he said: my prayers were never rejected by You, O my Lord."
وَإِنِّي خِفْتُ ٱلْمَوَالِيَ مِن وَرَآءِى وَكَانَتِ ٱمْرَأَتِي عَاقِراً فَهَبْ لِي مِن لَّدُنْكَ وَلِيّاً,"(Lo! I fear my kinsfolk) i.e. the inheritors (after me) i.e. there is no one after me to inherit my office and position, (since my wife) Hannah the sister of the mother of Mary the daughter of Amran ('Imran) the son of Matthan (Mathan) (is barren) and gives birth to no children. (Oh, give me from Thy presence) from You (a successor) a son,"
يَرِثُنِي وَيَرِثُ مِنْ آلِ يَعْقُوبَ وَٱجْعَلْهُ رَبِّ رَضِيّاً,"(Who shall inherit of me) who shall inherit my office and position (and inherit (also) of the house of Jacob) if they have an office and kingship, for the family of Jacob were John's maternal uncles. (And make him, my Lord, acceptable (unto Thee)) make him well pleasing to you and righteous."
يٰزَكَرِيَّآ إِنَّا نُبَشِّرُكَ بِغُلاَمٍ ٱسْمُهُ يَحْيَىٰ لَمْ نَجْعَل لَّهُ مِن قَبْلُ سَمِيّاً,"And so Gabriel called him, saying: (O Zachariah! Lo! We bring you tidings of a son whose name is John) Yahya in Arabic, because he has breathed life (ahya) into his mother's womb; (We have given the same name to none before (him)) We have not given before a son to Zachariah whose name is John; it is also said that this means: there was no one before him whose name was John."
قَالَ رَبِّ أَنَّىٰ يَكُونُ لِي غُلاَمٌ وَكَانَتِ ٱمْرَأَتِي عَاقِراً وَقَدْ بَلَغْتُ مِنَ ٱلْكِبَرِ عِتِيّاً,"(He said) Zachariah said to Gabriel: (My Lord!) my master, (How can I have a son when my wife is barren and I have reached infirm old age) how can I have a son when my wife is barren and my body has become dry?; it is also said that this means: how can I have a son when my wife is barren and I am seventy two years of age?"
قَالَ كَذٰلِكَ قَالَ رَبُّكَ هُوَ عَلَيَّ هَيِّنٌ وَقَدْ خَلَقْتُكَ مِن قَبْلُ وَلَمْ تَكُ شَيْئاً,"(He said) Gabriel said to him: (So (it will be)) just as I have told you. (Thy Lord saith: It is easy for Me) i.e. his creation is easy for Me, (even as I created thee) O Zachariah (before) before John, (when thou wast naught)."
قَالَ رَبِّ ٱجْعَل لِيۤ آيَةً قَالَ آيَتُكَ أَلاَّ تُكَلِّمَ ٱلنَّاسَ ثَلاَثَ لَيَالٍ سَوِيّاً,"(He said: My Lord!) O my Lord! (Appoint for me some token) some sign when my wife becomes pregnant. (He said: Thy token is that thou, with no bodily defect, shall not speak unto mankind) will not be able to speak to people (three nights) without suffering dumbness or any other illness."
فَخَرَجَ عَلَىٰ قَوْمِهِ مِنَ ٱلْمِحْرَابِ فَأَوْحَىٰ إِلَيْهِمْ أَن سَبِّحُواْ بُكْرَةً وَعَشِيّاً,"(Then he came forth unto his people from the sanctuary) from the prayer hall, (and signified to them) he made gestures to them; and it is also said: he wrote on the ground to them: (Glorify your Lord at break of day and fall of night) pray to Him in the morning and at night."
يٰيَحْيَىٰ خُذِ ٱلْكِتَابَ بِقُوَّةٍ وَآتَيْنَاهُ ٱلْحُكْمَ صَبِيّاً,"(O John!) Allah said to John when he reached the age of puberty and understanding: (Hold the Scripture) act according to that which is in the Torah, seriously and diligently. (And We gave him) and We gave John (wisdom) understanding and knowledge (when a child) when he was still young."
وَحَنَاناً مِّن لَّدُنَّا وَزَكَاةً وَكَانَ تَقِيّاً,"(And compassion from Our presence) and We gave him compassion from Our presence towards his parents, (and purity) as an act of charity to them; it is also said that this means: We gave righteousness with regard to his religion; (and he was devout) he was obedient to his Lord,"
وَبَرّاً بِوَالِدَيْهِ وَلَمْ يَكُن جَبَّاراً عَصِيّاً,"(And dutiful towards his parents) he was kind to his parent. (And he was not arrogant) in his practice of Religion, ready to hurt when angry, (rebellious) disobedient of his Lord."

وَٱذْكُرْ فِي ٱلْكِتَابِ مَرْيَمَ إِذِ ٱنتَبَذَتْ مِنْ أَهْلِهَا مَكَاناً شَرْقِياً,"(And make mention) O Muhammad (of Mary) of the event of Mary (in the Scripture) in the Qur'an, (when she had withdrawn from her people to a chamber looking East) east of their house,"
فَٱتَّخَذَتْ مِن دُونِهِم حِجَاباً فَأَرْسَلْنَآ إِلَيْهَآ رُوحَنَا فَتَمَثَّلَ لَهَا بَشَراً سَوِيّاً,(And had chosen seclusion from them) so that she purifies herself after the end of her menses. (Then We sent unto her Our Spirit) Our Messenger Gabriel when she had finished purifying herself (and it assumed for her the likeness of a perfect man).
قَالَتْ إِنِّيۤ أَعُوذُ بِٱلرَّحْمَـٰنِ مِنكَ إِن كُنتَ تَقِيّاً,"(She said) Mary said: (Lo! I seek refuge in the Beneficent One from thee, if thou art God-fearing [taqiyya]) if you are obedient to the All-Merciful; it is also said that Taqiyy was the name of an evil man and she thought that he was that man, which explains why she sought refuge in Allah from him."
قَالَ إِنَّمَآ أَنَاْ رَسُولُ رَبِّكِ لأَهَبَ لَكِ غُلاَماً زَكِيّاً,"(He said) Gabriel said to her: (I am only a messenger of thy Lord, that I may bestow on thee) that Allah may bestow on you (a faultless son) a righteous son."
قَالَتْ أَنَّىٰ يَكُونُ لِي غُلاَمٌ وَلَمْ يَمْسَسْنِي بَشَرٌ وَلَمْ أَكُ بَغِيّاً,"(She said) Mary said to Gabriel (pbuh): (How can I have a son when no mortal hath touched me) when no husband has come near me, (neither have I been unchaste) neither have I been an adulteress!"
قَالَ كَذٰلِكَ قَالَ رَبُّكِ هُوَ عَلَيَّ هَيِّنٌ وَلِنَجْعَلَهُ آيَةً لِّلْنَّاسِ وَرَحْمَةً مِّنَّا وَكَانَ أَمْراً مَّقْضِيّاً,"(He said) Gabriel said to her: (So (it will be)) just as I have told you. (Thy Lord saith: It is easy for Me) it is easy for Me to create him without a father. (And (it will be) that We may make of him a revelation) a token and admonition (for mankind) for the Children of Israel: a son without a father (and a mercy from Us) to whoever believes in him, (and it is a thing ordained) it is a thing decreed, that he shall be a son without a father."
فَحَمَلَتْهُ فَٱنْتَبَذَتْ بِهِ مَكَاناً قَصِيّاً,"(And she, conceived him) she bore him for nine months; and it is also said: her pregnancy lasted one day, (and she withdrew with him) i.e. to deliver him (to a place) far away from people."
فَأَجَآءَهَا ٱلْمَخَاضُ إِلَىٰ جِذْعِ ٱلنَّخْلَةِ قَالَتْ يٰلَيْتَنِي مِتُّ قَبْلَ هَـٰذَا وَكُنتُ نَسْياً مَّنسِيّاً,"(And the pangs of childbirth drove her unto the trunk of the palm-tree) a dry palm-tree. (She said: Oh, would that I had died ere this) this child; and it is said that this means: before this day (and had become a thing of naught, forgotten) an abandoned thing which is never mentioned! And it is also said that this means: a still born child."
فَنَادَاهَا مِن تَحْتِهَآ أَلاَّ تَحْزَنِي قَدْ جَعَلَ رَبُّكِ تَحْتَكِ سَرِيّاً,"(Then (one) cried unto her from below her) i.e. Gabriel, (saying: Grieve not) O Mary over the birth of Jesus! (Thy Lord hath placed a rivulet beneath thee) a prophet beneath you; it is also said that this means: Jesus cried unto her from beneath her: grieve not your Lord has placed a stream beneath you,"
وَهُزِّىۤ إِلَيْكِ بِجِذْعِ ٱلنَّخْلَةِ تُسَاقِطْ عَلَيْكِ رُطَباً جَنِيّاً,"(And shake the trunk of the palm-tree towards you, thou wilt cause ripe dates to fall upon thee)."
فَكُلِي وَٱشْرَبِي وَقَرِّي عَيْناً فَإِمَّا تَرَيِنَّ مِنَ ٱلبَشَرِ أَحَداً فَقُولِيۤ إِنِّي نَذَرْتُ لِلرَّحْمَـٰنِ صَوْماً فَلَنْ أُكَلِّمَ ٱلْيَوْمَ إِنسِيّاً,"(So eat) the date (and drink) from the stream (and be consoled) by the birth of Jesus (pbuh). (And if thou meetest any mortal) and if you meet any human being, after today (say: Lo! I have vowed a fast unto the Beneficent, and may not speak this day to any mortal) and then be silent until Jesus speaks after you."
فَأَتَتْ بِهِ قَوْمَهَا تَحْمِلُهُ قَالُواْ يٰمَرْيَمُ لَقَدْ جِئْتِ شَيْئاً فَرِيّاً,"(Then she brought him) i.e. Jesus (to her own folk, carrying him) when he was forty days old. (They said: O Mary! thou hast come with an amazing thing) you have come with an abominable act."
يٰأُخْتَ هَارُونَ مَا كَانَ أَبُوكِ ٱمْرَأَ سَوْءٍ وَمَا كَانَتْ أُمُّكِ بَغِيّاً,"(Oh sister of Aaron!) O you who resembles Aaron in worship-Aaron was a righteous man, one of the best among people-; and it is also said that Aaron was an evil man and so they compared her to him; and it is also said that Aaron was her half brother from her father side. (Your father was not a wicked man) your father was not an adulterer (nor was your mother a harlot) nor was your mother a whore."
فَأَشَارَتْ إِلَيْهِ قَالُواْ كَيْفَ نُكَلِّمُ مَن كَانَ فِي ٱلْمَهْدِ صَبِيّاً,"(Then she pointed to him) she pointed to Jesus (pbuh) that they should speak to him. (They said: How can we tale to one who is in the cradle, a young boy) forty days old?"
قَالَ إِنِّي عَبْدُ ٱللَّهِ آتَانِيَ ٱلْكِتَابَ وَجَعَلَنِي نَبِيّاً,"Jesus then spoke to them, (He spake: Lo! I am the slave of Allah. He hath given me the Scripture) He taught me the Torah and the Gospel while still in my mother's womb (and hath appointed me a Prophet) after my mother delivered me,"
وَجَعَلَنِي مُبَارَكاً أَيْنَ مَا كُنتُ وَأَوْصَانِي بِٱلصَّلاَةِ وَٱلزَّكَاةِ مَا دُمْتُ حَيّاً,"(And hath made me blessed) and has made me a teacher of goodness (wheresoever I may be) or stay, (and hath enjoined upon me prayer) and enjoined upon me the perfection of the prayer (and alms giving) acts of charity (so long as I remain alive) as long as I live,"
وَبَرّاً بِوَٰلِدَتِي وَلَمْ يَجْعَلْنِي جَبَّاراً شَقِيّاً,"(And (hath made me) dutiful towards her who bore me) and kind to my mother, (and hath not made me arrogant) in the practice of religion, ready to hurt when angry, (unblest) and has not made me disobedient to Him."
وَٱلسَّلاَمُ عَلَيَّ يَوْمَ وُلِدْتُّ وَيَوْمَ أَمُوتُ وَيَوْمَ أُبْعَثُ حَيّاً,"(Peace on me the day I was born) safety to me from Satan's touch when I was born, (and the day I die) and safety to me from the compression of the grave when I die, (and the day I shall be raised alive) when I am resurrected alive from the grave!"
ذٰلِكَ عِيسَى ٱبْنُ مَرْيَمَ قَوْلَ ٱلْحَقِّ ٱلَّذِي فِيهِ يَمْتُرُونَ,"(Such was Jesus, son of Mary) such was the event of Jesus, son of Mary: ((this is) a statement of the Truth concerning which they doubt) i.e. the Christians, for some of them said he is Allah, and some said he was the son of Allah and some of them claimed he was Allah's partner."
مَا كَانَ للَّهِ أَن يَتَّخِذَ مِن وَلَدٍ سُبْحَانَهُ إِذَا قَضَىٰ أَمْراً فَإِنَّمَا يَقُولُ لَهُ كُن فَيَكُونُ,"(It befitteth not (the Majesty of) Allah that He should take unto Himself a son Glory be to Him!) Allah absolves Himself from taking a son or partner. (When He decreeth a thing) when He wants to create a son without a father, (He saith unto it only: Be! and it is) a son without a father, just like Jesus."
وَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ رَبِّي وَرَبُّكُمْ فَٱعْبُدُوهُ هَـٰذَا صِرَاطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ,"When Jesus brought the Message to his people, he said: I am the servant of Allah and His messiah, (And lo! Allah is my Lord) my Creator and Provider (and your Lord) your Creator and Provider. (So serve Him) profess His divine Oneness. (That) the monotheism with which I am enjoining you (is the right path) an established religion with which Allah is pleased, i.e. Islam."
فَٱخْتَلَفَ ٱلأَحْزَابُ مِن بَيْنِهِمْ فَوَيْلٌ لِّلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِن مَّشْهَدِ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ,"(The sects) the disbelievers (among them differ) some saying He is Allah, some he is the son of Allah and some Allah's partner: (but woe) a river in Gehenna containing puss and blood; it is also said that this means: severe chastisement (unto the disbelievers) who became different sects regarding Jesus (from the meeting of an awful Day) from the chastisement of the Day of Judgement."
أَسْمِعْ بِهِمْ وَأَبْصِرْ يَوْمَ يَأْتُونَنَا لَـٰكِنِ ٱلظَّالِمُونَ ٱلْيَوْمَ فِي ضَلاَلٍ مُّبِينٍ,"(See and hear them) how well they will see and hear (on the Day they come unto Us) this is the Day of Judgement, that Jesus is not Allah, His son or partner! (Yet the evil-doers) the idolaters (are today) in this worldly life (in error manifest) in manifest disbelief because of saying that Jesus is Allah, His son or His partner."
وَأَنْذِرْهُمْ يَوْمَ ٱلْحَسْرَةِ إِذْ قُضِيَ ٱلأَمْرُ وَهُمْ فِي غَفْلَةٍ وَهُمْ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ,"(And warn them) O Muhammad (of the Day of anguish) of the Day of regret (when the case hath been decided) when the reckoning is over and the people of Paradise enter Paradise and the people of hell enter hell and Death is slain.

كُلُواْ وَٱرْعَوْا أَنْعَامَكُمْ إِنَّ فِي ذٰلِكَ لآيَاتٍ لأُوْلِي ٱلنُّهَىٰ,((Saying): Eat ye) that which you eat (and feed your) grazing (cattle) from its vegetation. (Lo! Herein) in their difference and different colours (verily are portents) signs (for men of thought) for those endowed with intellect among people.
مِنْهَا خَلَقْنَاكُمْ وَفِيهَا نُعِيدُكُمْ وَمِنْهَا نُخْرِجُكُمْ تَارَةً أُخْرَىٰ,"(Thereof) from the earth (We created you) He says We created you from Adam and Adam is from dust, and the dust is from the earth, (and thereunto) to the earth (we return you) He says: We bury you (and thence) from the earth (We bring you forth) He says: from the grave We shall bring you forth (a second time) after death, i.e. for the Resurrection."
وَلَقَدْ أَرَيْنَاهُ آيَاتِنَا كُلَّهَا فَكَذَّبَ وَأَبَىٰ,"(And We verily did show him) i.e. Pharaoh (all Our tokens) the hand, the staff, the flood, the locusts, the lice, the frogs, blood, drought and lack of harvest, (but he denied them) i.e. the signs and said that they are not from Allah (and refused) to surrender to Allah, rejecting thus all the signs."
قَالَ أَجِئْتَنَا لِتُخْرِجَنَا مِنْ أَرْضِنَا بِسِحْرِكَ يٰمُوسَىٰ,"(He said) to Moses: (Hast thou come to drive us out from our land) Egypt (by thy magic, O Moses?"
فَلَنَأْتِيَنَّكَ بِسِحْرٍ مِّثْلِهِ فَٱجْعَلْ بَيْنَنَا وَبَيْنَكَ مَوْعِداً لاَّ نُخْلِفُهُ نَحْنُ وَلاَ أَنتَ مَكَاناً سُوًى,"But we surely can produce magic the like thereof) like the magic you produced; (so appoint a tryst) appoint a time of encounter (between us and you, which neither we nor thou shall fail to keep, at a place convenient (to us both)) other than this place; it is also said that this means: a place that is fair to both of us."
قَالَ مَوْعِدُكُمْ يَوْمُ ٱلزِّينَةِ وَأَن يُحْشَرَ ٱلنَّاسُ ضُحًى,"((Moses) said: Your tryst) the appointed time (shall be the day of the feast) the day of the market, it is also said this means the day of celebration; and it is also said this means the new year's day, (and let the people assemble) from all the townships (when the sun hath risen high) at the time of mid-morning."
فَتَوَلَّىٰ فِرْعَوْنُ فَجَمَعَ كَيْدَهُ ثُمَّ أَتَىٰ,(Then Pharaoh went) to his folk (and gathered his strength) he gathered his advisers and magicians who were 72 in number (and came (to the appointed tryst)) to the appointed time of the gathering.
قَالَ لَهُمْ مُّوسَىٰ وَيْلَكُمْ لاَ تَفْتَرُواْ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ كَذِباً فَيُسْحِتَكُم بِعَذَابٍ وَقَدْ خَابَ مَنِ ٱفْتَرَىٰ,"(Moses said unto them) to the magicians: (Woe unto you!) may Allah tighten this worldly life for you (Invent not a lie against Allah, lest He extirpate you) lest He destroys you (by some punishment) from Him. (He who lieth) about Allah (faileth miserably) loses miserably."
فَتَنَازَعُوۤاْ أَمْرَهُمْ بَيْنَهُمْ وَأَسَرُّواْ ٱلنَّجْوَىٰ,"(Then they debated one with another what they must do) they consulted with one another and decided that if Moses defeats them, they will believe in him, (and they kept their counsel secret) from Pharaoh."
قَالُوۤاْ إِنْ هَـٰذَانِ لَسَاحِرَانِ يُرِيدَانِ أَن يُخْرِجَاكُمْ مِّنْ أَرْضِكُمْ بِسِحْرِهِمَا وَيَذْهَبَا بِطَرِيقَتِكُمُ ٱلْمُثْلَىٰ,"Then (They said) openly: (Lo! these are two wizards) i.e. Moses and Aaron are two wizards (who would drive you out from your country) Egypt (by their magic, and destroy your best traditions) your religion and your best men;"
فَأَجْمِعُواْ كَيْدَكُمْ ثُمَّ ٱئْتُواْ صَفّاً وَقَدْ أَفْلَحَ ٱلْيَوْمَ مَنِ ٱسْتَعْلَىٰ,"(So arrange your plan) your scheming, magic and knowledge, (and come in battle line) all together. (Whoso is uppermost) victorious (this day will be indeed successful)."
قَالُواْ يٰمُوسَىٰ إِمَّآ أَن تُلْقِيَ وَإِمَّآ أَن نَّكُونَ أَوَّلَ مَنْ أَلْقَىٰ,"(They said) the magicians said to Moses: (O Moses! Either throw first) either you throw your staff to the ground first, (or let us be the first to throw?)"
قَالَ بَلْ أَلْقُواْ فَإِذَا حِبَالُهُمْ وَعِصِيُّهُمْ يُخَيَّلُ إِلَيْهِ مِن سِحْرِهِمْ أَنَّهَا تَسْعَىٰ,"(He said) Moses said to them: (Nay, do ye throw) you first! And so they threw 72 staffs and 72 ropes. (Then Lo! their cords and their staves, by their magic, appeared to him) to Moses (as though they ran) they moved about."
فَأَوْجَسَ فِي نَفْسِهِ خِيفَةً مُّوسَىٰ,"(And Moses conceived a fear in his mind) Moses concealed his fear of them. He was afraid that they would kill all those who believed in him, if he failed to defeat them."
قُلْنَا لاَ تَخَفْ إِنَّكَ أَنتَ ٱلأَعْلَىٰ,(We said) to Moses: (Fear not! Lo! thou art the higher) you will be victorious over them.
وَأَلْقِ مَا فِي يَمِينِكَ تَلْقَفْ مَا صَنَعُوۤاْ إِنَّمَا صَنَعُواْ كَيْدُ سَاحِرٍ وَلاَ يُفْلِحُ ٱلسَّاحِرُ حَيْثُ أَتَىٰ,"(Throw) to the ground (that which is in thy right hand) O Moses! (It will eat up) it will swallow (that which they have made) that which they have thrown of staffs and ropes. (Lo! that which they have made) that which they have thrown to the ground is (but a wizard's artifice, and a wizard shall not be successful) he shall not be safe nor escape Allah's chastisement or succeed (to whatever point (of skill) he may attain) wherever he is."
فَأُلْقِيَ ٱلسَّحَرَةُ سُجَّداً قَالُوۤاْ آمَنَّا بِرَبِّ هَارُونَ وَمُوسَىٰ,"(Then the wizards were (all) flung down prostrate) their prostration was so quick that one had the impression they were thrown to the ground, (crying) i.e. the magicians: (We believe in the Lord of Aaron and Moses."
قَالَ آمَنتُمْ لَهُ قَبْلَ أَنْ ءَاذَنَ لَكُمْ إِنَّهُ لَكَبِيرُكُمُ ٱلَّذِي عَلَّمَكُمُ ٱلسِّحْرَ فَلأُقَطِّعَنَّ أَيْدِيَكُمْ وَأَرْجُلَكُمْ مِّنْ خِلاَفٍ وَلأُصَلِّبَنَّكُمْ فِي جُذُوعِ ٱلنَّخْلِ وَلَتَعْلَمُنَّ أَيُّنَآ أَشَدُّ عَذَاباً وَأَبْقَىٰ,"(Pharaoh) said) to them: (Ye put faith in him before I give you leave) you believed in him before I commanded you to do so. (Lo! he is) i.e. Moses (your chief) the most erudite of you (who taught you magic. Now surely I shall cut off your hands and your feet alternately) the right hand with the left leg, (and I shall crucify you on the trunks of palm-trees, and ye shall know for certain which of us hath sterner and more lasting punishment) me or the Lord of Moses and Aaron."
قَالُواْ لَن نُّؤْثِرَكَ عَلَىٰ مَا جَآءَنَا مِنَ ٱلْبَيِّنَاتِ وَٱلَّذِي فَطَرَنَا فَٱقْضِ مَآ أَنتَ قَاضٍ إِنَّمَا تَقْضِي هَـٰذِهِ ٱلْحَيَاةَ ٱلدُّنْيَآ,"(They said) the magicians said to Pharaoh: (We choose thee not) we will not choose worshipping and obeying you (above the clear proofs) of commands, prohibitions, the Scripture, the Messenger and all the signs (that have come unto us, and above Him Who created us) we will choose to worship He who created us. (So decree what thou wilt decree) so proceed to do whatever you wish and sentence us with whatever sentence you wish. (Thou wilt end for us only the life of the world) you will sentence us only in this worldly life but you do not have any power over us in the Hereafter."
إِنَّآ آمَنَّا بِرَبِّنَا لِيَغْفِرَ لَنَا خَطَايَانَا وَمَآ أَكْرَهْتَنَا عَلَيْهِ مِنَ ٱلسِّحْرِ وَٱللَّهُ خَيْرٌ وَأَبْقَىٰ,"(Lo! we believe in our Lord, that He may forgive us our sins) our idolatry (and the magic unto which thou didst force us) the magic which you coerced us to learn. (Allah is better and more lasting) that which is with Allah of reward and favour is better and more lasting that the wealth you give us."
إِنَّهُ مَن يَأْتِ رَبَّهُ مُجْرِماً فَإِنَّ لَهُ جَهَنَّمَ لاَ يَمُوتُ فِيهَا وَلاَ يَحْيَىٰ,"(Lo! whoso cometh) on the Day of Judgement (guilty) an idolater (unto his Lord, verily for him is hell. There he will neither die) such that he finds rest (nor live) a beneficial life."
وَمَن يَأْتِهِ مُؤْمِناً قَدْ عَمِلَ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ فَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ لَهُمُ ٱلدَّرَجَاتُ ٱلْعُلَىٰ,"(But whoso cometh unto Him) on the Day of Judgement (a believer) sincere in his faith, (having done good works) secretly between himself and his Lord, (for such are the high stations) in the Gardens;"
جَنَّاتُ عَدْنٍ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلأَنْهَارُ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا وَذٰلِكَ جَزَآءُ مَن تَزَكَّىٰ,"Then He explained, saying: (Gardens of Eden) this is the Abode of the All-Merciful which He created with His own Hand and power in the middle of the Gardens of Paradise (underneath which) beneath its trees and habitations (rivers) rivers of wine, water, honey and milk (flow, wherein they will abide for ever) living in Paradise, neither to die nor leave it. (That) that Garden and eternity (is the reward of him who groweth) is the reward of he who believes in Allah's divine Oneness and then does good works."
وَلَقَدْ أَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَىٰ مُوسَىٰ أَنْ أَسْرِ بِعِبَادِي فَٱضْرِبْ لَهُمْ طَرِيقاً فِي ٱلْبَحْرِ يَبَساً لاَّ تَخَافُ دَرَكاً وَلاَ تَخْشَىٰ,"(And verily We inspired Moses, saying: Take away) lead (My slaves by night) at the beginning of the night (and strike for them) show them (a dry path in the sea, fearing not to be overtaken) by Pharaoh, (neither being afraid (of the sea)) neither being afraid of drowning."
فَأَتْبَعَهُمْ فِرْعَوْنُ بِجُنُودِهِ فَغَشِيَهُمْ مِّنَ ٱلْيَمِّ مَا غَشِيَهُمْ,(Then Pharaoh followed with his hosts and there covered them that which did cover them of the sea) they drowned in the sea.
وَأَضَلَّ فِرْعَوْنُ قَوْمَهُ وَمَا هَدَىٰ,"(And Pharaoh led his folk astray) Pharaoh destroyed his people in the sea, (he did not guide them) he did not save them; it is also said that this means: he misguided them regarding Allah's religion and did not guide them to the Truth."
يٰبَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ قَدْ أَنجَيْنَاكُمْ مِّنْ عَدُوِّكُمْ وَوَاعَدْنَاكُمْ جَانِبَ ٱلطُّورِ ٱلأَيْمَنَ وَنَزَّلْنَا عَلَيْكُمُ ٱلْمَنَّ وَٱلسَّلْوَىٰ,"(O Children of Israel!) O Children of Jacob (We delivered you from your enemy) from Pharaoh, (and We made a covenant with you on the holy mountain's side) the right side of Moses by giving him the Scripture, (and sent down on you the manna and the quails) in the wilderness,"
كُلُواْ مِن طَيِّبَاتِ مَا رَزَقْنَاكُمْ وَلاَ تَطْغَوْاْ فِيهِ فَيَحِلَّ عَلَيْكُمْ غَضَبِي وَمَن يَحْلِلْ عَلَيْهِ غَضَبِي فَقَدْ هَوَىٰ,"((Saying): Eat of the good things) of the lawful things (wherewith We have provided you) of manna and quails, (and transgress not in respect thereof) do not disbelieve in Him; it is also said that this means: do not save for the next day (lest My wrath) and torment (come upon you; and he on whom My wrath cometh) and he on whom my wrath and torment is decreed, (he is lost indeed) he is destroyed."
وَإِنِّي لَغَفَّارٌ لِّمَن تَابَ وَآمَنَ وَعَمِلَ صَالِحَاً ثُمَّ ٱهْتَدَىٰ,"(And lo! verily I am Forgiving towards him who repenteth) from idolatry (and believeth) in Allah (and doeth good) with sincerity, (and afterward walketh aright) then truly sees the reward of his works; it is also said that this means: he is guided to the community of the orthodox faithful (ahl al-sunnah wa'l-jama'ah) and dies in that state."
وَمَآ أَعْجَلَكَ عَن قَومِكَ يٰمُوسَىٰ,"When Moses was about to go with the seventy chosen men to the tryst, he hastened and went ahead of them; (And (it was said)) Allah said to him: (What hath made thee hasten from thy folk, O Moses?"
قَالَ هُمْ أُوْلاۤءِ عَلَىٰ أَثَرِي وَعَجِلْتُ إِلَيْكَ رَبِّ لِتَرْضَىٰ,He said: They are close upon my track) they are following in my track. And (I hastened unto Thee that Thou mightest be well pleased) so that Your good pleasure with me is increased.
قَالَ فَإِنَّا قَدْ فَتَنَّا قَوْمَكَ مِن بَعْدِكَ وَأَضَلَّهُمُ ٱلسَّامِرِيُّ,"(He said) O Moses! (Lo! We have tried thy folk) with the worship of the calf (in thine absence) after you set off for the mountain, (and al-Samiri hath misled them) al-Samiri commanded them to do so."
فَرَجَعَ مُوسَىٰ إِلَىٰ قَوْمِهِ غَضْبَٰنَ أَسِفاً قَالَ يٰقَوْمِ أَلَمْ يَعِدْكُمْ رَبُّكُمْ وَعْداً حَسَناً أَفَطَالَ عَلَيْكُمُ ٱلْعَهْدُ أَمْ أَرَدتُّمْ أَن يَحِلَّ عَلَيْكُمْ غَضَبٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ فَأَخْلَفْتُمْ مَّوْعِدِي,"(Then Moses went back) when Moses went back (unto his folk) with the 70 men and heard the sound of the sedition, he became (angry and sad. He said: O my people! Hath not your Lord promised you a fair promise) a true promise? (Did the time appointed then appear too long for you) did I exceed the appointed time, (or did ye wish that wrath from your Lord should come upon you) should become prescribed upon you, (that ye broke tryst with me) that you went against my promise?"
قَالُواْ مَآ أَخْلَفْنَا مَوْعِدَكَ بِمَلْكِنَا وَلَـٰكِنَّا حُمِّلْنَآ أَوْزَاراً مِّن زِينَةِ ٱلْقَوْمِ فَقَذَفْنَاهَا فَكَذَلِكَ أَلْقَى ٱلسَّامِرِيُّ,"(They said) O Moses: (We broke not tryst with thee) we did not go against your promise (of our own will) intentionally knowing that we were doing so, (but we were laden with burdens) loads (of ornaments of the folk) of the ornament of the people of Pharaoh, and the evil omen of that burden led us to worship the calf, (then cast them) then we cast the ornament ((in the Fire), for thus al-Samiri proposed) just as al-Samiri did."
فَأَخْرَجَ لَهُمْ عِجْلاً جَسَداً لَّهُ خُوَارٌ فَقَالُواْ هَـٰذَآ إِلَـٰهُكُمْ وَإِلَـٰهُ مُوسَىٰ فَنَسِيَ,"(Then he produced for them) from the gold they threw in the Fire, al-Samiri made for them (a calf, of saffron hue) a small form without a spirit, (which gave forth a lowing sound. And they cried) what is this? And al-Samiri said: (This is your God and the God of Moses, but he hath forgotten) al-Samiri abandoned Allah's worship and command; it is also said that this means: Moses left the way and took a wrong turn."
أَفَلاَ يَرَوْنَ أَلاَّ يَرْجِعُ إِلَيْهِمْ قَوْلاً وَلاَ يَمْلِكُ لَهُمْ ضَرّاً وَلاَ نَفْعاً,"Allah then said: (See they not) i.e. al-Samiri and his host, (then, that it) the calf (returneth no saying unto them) does not answer them (and possesseth for them) and has no power (neither hurt) either to drive away harm from them (nor use) or bring benefit to them?"
وَلَقَدْ قَالَ لَهُمْ هَارُونُ مِن قَبْلُ يٰقَوْمِ إِنَّمَا فُتِنتُمْ بِهِ وَإِنَّ رَبَّكُمُ ٱلرَّحْمَـٰنُ فَٱتَّبِعُونِي وَأَطِيعُوۤاْ أَمْرِي,"(And Aaron indeed had told them beforehand) before the return of Moses (pbuh) to them: (O my people! Ye are but being seduced therewith) you have been tried with the lowing sound and the worship of the calf, (for lo! your Lord is the Beneficent, so follow me) regarding His religion (and obey my order) obey my saying and advice."
قَالُواْ لَن نَّبْرَحَ عَلَيْهِ عَاكِفِينَ حَتَّىٰ يَرْجِعَ إِلَيْنَا مُوسَىٰ,(They said: We shall by no means cease to be its votaries) we will continue to worship it (till Moses return unto us).
قَالَ يٰهَرُونُ مَا مَنَعَكَ إِذْ رَأَيْتَهُمْ ضَلُّوۤاْ,"When Moses returned, (He said) to Aaron: (O Aaron! What held thee back when thou didst see them gone astray) from the right way,"
أَلاَّ تَتَّبِعَنِ أَفَعَصَيْتَ أَمْرِي,(That thou followedst me not) that you failed to follow my advice and fight against them? (Hast thou then disobeyed my order) have you then discarded my advice?
قَالَ يَبْنَؤُمَّ لاَ تَأْخُذْ بِلِحْيَتِي وَلاَ بِرَأْسِي إِنِّي خَشِيتُ أَن تَقُولَ فَرَّقْتَ بَيْنَ بَنِيۤ إِسْرَآءِيلَ وَلَمْ تَرْقُبْ قَوْلِي,"(He said) Aaron said to Moses: (O son of my mother) he mentioned their mother so that he be kind and compassionate with him! (Clutch not my beard nor my head) nor my hair! (I feared lest thou shouldst say: Thou hast caused division among the Children of Israel) if I had killed them, (and hast not waited for my word) and did not wait until I come back. This is why I refrained from fighting them."
قَالَ فَمَا خَطْبُكَ يٰسَامِرِيُّ,"Then Moses went to al-Samiri, and he (said: And what hast thou to say, O Samiri?) What drove you to worship the calf, O Samiri?"
قَالَ بَصُرْتُ بِمَا لَمْ يَبْصُرُواْ بِهِ فَقَبَضْتُ قَبْضَةً مِّنْ أَثَرِ ٱلرَّسُولِ فَنَبَذْتُهَا وَكَذٰلِكَ سَوَّلَتْ لِي نَفْسِي,"(He said) al-Samiri said: (I perceived what they perceive not) I saw what the children of Israel did not see. Moses asked him: and what did you see that they did not? He said: I saw Gabriel riding a female horse, Balqa', the beast of life, (so I seized a handful from the footsteps of the messenger) from the dust upon which Gabriel's horse stepped on, (and then threw it in) and threw it in the calf's mouth and behind. (Thus my soul commended to me) thus did my soul entice me to do."
قَالَ فَٱذْهَبْ فَإِنَّ لَكَ فِي ٱلْحَيَاةِ أَن تَقُولَ لاَ مِسَاسَ وَإِنَّ لَكَ مَوْعِداً لَّن تُخْلَفَهُ وَٱنظُرْ إِلَىٰ إِلَـٰهِكَ ٱلَّذِي ظَلْتَ عَلَيْهِ عَاكِفاً لَّنُحَرِّقَنَّهُ ثُمَّ لَنَنسِفَنَّهُ فِي ٱلْيَمِّ نَسْفاً,((Moses) said) to him: (Then go) O Samiri! (And lo! in this life) for as long as you live (it is for thee to say: Touch me not) you do not interact with anyone and no one will interact with you! (and lo! there is for you a tryst) you have an appointed time on the Day of Judgement (thou canst not break) you cannot miss. (Now look upon your god of which thou hast remained a votary) look at the god which you worshipped. (Verily we will burn it and will scatter its dust over the sea)
إِنَّمَآ إِلَـٰهُكُمُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِي لاۤ إِلَـٰهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ وَسِعَ كُلَّ شَيْءٍ عِلْماً,"(Your God is only Allah, than Whom there is no other God) He has no children or partners. (He embraceth all things in His knowledge) He knows all things."
كَذٰلِكَ نَقُصُّ عَلَيْكَ مِنْ أَنْبَآءِ مَا قَدْ سَبَقَ وَقَدْ آتَيْنَاكَ مِن لَّدُنَّا ذِكْراً,"(Thus relate Who unto thee) in this way we sent you, O Muhammad, Gabriel with (some tidings of that which happened of old) with the events of past nations, (and We have given thee from Our presence a Reminder) We have honoured you with the Qur'an which contains the events of past and future generations."
مَّنْ أَعْرَضَ عَنْهُ فَإِنَّهُ يَحْمِلُ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ وِزْراً,"(Whoso turneth away from it) whoever disbelieves in it, (he verily will bear a burden) idolatry (on the Day of Resurrection)"
خَالِدِينَ فِيهِ وَسَآءَ لَهُمْ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ حِمْلاً,"(Abiding under it) abiding in the punishment for committing idolatry, (an evil burden for them on the Day of Resurrection) their sins are an evil burden for them on the Day of Resurrection,"
يَوْمَ يُنفَخُ فِي ٱلصُّورِ وَنَحْشُرُ ٱلْمُجْرِمِينَ يَوْمِئِذٍ زُرْقاً,"(The day when the Trumpet is blown) i.e. on the first blowing of the Trumpet. (On that day we assemble the guilty) the idolaters (white-eyed) blind,"
يَتَخَافَتُونَ بَيْنَهُمْ إِن لَّبِثْتُمْ إِلاَّ عَشْراً,(Murmuring among themselves) saying to each other in murmur: (Ye have tarried) in the grave (but ten (days)).
نَّحْنُ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا يَقُولُونَ إِذْ يَقُولُ أَمْثَلُهُمْ طَرِيقَةً إِن لَّبِثْتُمْ إِلاَّ يَوْماً,"(We are best aware of what they utter) regarding the resurrection (when their best in conduct) the best of them in intellect, the most sound of judgement and the most truthful in words (say: Ye have tarried) in your graves (but a day)."
وَيَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ ٱلْجِبَالِ فَقُلْ يَنسِفُهَا رَبِّي نَسْفاً,"(They will ask thee) O Muhammad, Allah's blessings and peace be upon him. It was the Banu Thaqif who asked him, (of the mountains (on that day)) they will ask you about the state of the mountains on the Day of Judgement. (Say) to them, O Muhammad: (My Lord will break them into scattered dust) Allah will completely uproot them."
فَيَذَرُهَا قَاعاً صَفْصَفاً,"(And leave it) and leave the earth (as an empty plain) without vegetation,"
لاَّ تَرَىٰ فِيهَا عِوَجاً وَلاۤ أَمْتاً,(Wherein thou seest neither curve) valleys or cleaves (nor ruggedness) nor plants or anything sprouting out of the earth.
يَوْمَئِذٍ يَتَّبِعُونَ ٱلدَّاعِيَ لاَ عِوَجَ لَهُ وَخَشَعَتِ ٱلأَصْوَاتُ لِلرَّحْمَـٰنِ فَلاَ تَسْمَعُ إِلاَّ هَمْساً,"(On that day) which is the Day of Judgement (they follow the summoner) they will all rush and go to the summoner (who deceiveth not) they will turn neither to the right nor to the left, (and voices are hushed for the Beneficent) out of awe for the Beneficent, (and thou hearest) O Muhammad (but a faint murmur)."
يَوْمَئِذٍ لاَّ تَنفَعُ ٱلشَّفَاعَةُ إِلاَّ مَنْ أَذِنَ لَهُ ٱلرَّحْمَـٰنُ وَرَضِيَ لَهُ قَوْلاً,(On that Day) the Day of Judgement (no intercession availeth) the angels will not intercede for anyone (save (that of) him unto whom the Beneficent hath given leave) to intercede (and whose He accepteth) He accepts from him his saying: “there is no deity except Allah”:

وَعَنَتِ ٱلْوُجُوهُ لِلْحَيِّ ٱلْقَيُّومِ وَقَدْ خَابَ مَنْ حَمَلَ ظُلْماً,"(And faces humble themselves) faces are lowered in this worldly life through prostration; it is also said that this means: the faces are humbled and submitted on the Day of Judgement (before the Living) Who dies not, (the Eternal) Who has no beginning. (And he who beareth (a burden of) wrong-doing) idolatry (is indeed a failure (on that Day)) he loses on that Day."
وَمَن يَعْمَلْ مِنَ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ وَهُوَ مُؤْمِنٌ فَلاَ يَخَافُ ظُلْماً وَلاَ هَضْماً,"(And he who hath done some good works) between him and his Lord, (being a believer) true in his faith, (he fears not injustice) he does not fear the thwarting of all his works (nor begrudging) nor the decrease of his works."
وَكَذٰلِكَ أَنزَلْنَاهُ قُرْآناً عَرَبِيّاً وَصَرَّفْنَا فِيهِ مِنَ ٱلْوَعِيدِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَّقُونَ أَوْ يُحْدِثُ لَهُمْ ذِكْراً,"(Thus We have revealed it as a Lecture in Arabic) We have sent down Gabriel with the Qur'an to Muhammad (pbuh) in the Arabic usage, (and have displayed therein) and have exposited in the Qur'an (certain threats) i.e. threats and promises, (that peradventure they may keep from evil) that perhaps they may ward off disbelief, idolatry and indecencies (or that it may cause them to take heed) or obtain a reward if they believed; it is also said that this means: or obtain eminence through the profession of Allah's divine Oneness; it is also said that this means: or incur chastisement if they did not believe."
فَتَعَٰلَى ٱللَّهُ ٱلْمَلِكُ ٱلْحَقُّ وَلاَ تَعْجَلْ بِٱلْقُرْءانِ مِن قَبْلِ أَن يُقْضَىٰ إِلَيْكَ وَحْيُهُ وَقُل رَّبِّ زِدْنِي عِلْماً,"(Then exalted be Allah, the True King) He exonerated Himself from having children or partners! (And hasten not with the Qur'an) do not hasten, O Muhammad, to recite the Qur'an (ere its revelation hath been perfected unto thee) before Gabriel finishes reading the Qur'an to you. This is because when Gabriel used to bring new revelations, the Prophet (pbuh) would start to repeat them after Gabriel even before the latter finished his reading, for fear of forgetting what was recited to him. Allah therefore told him to stop doing this, saying: (and say) O Muhammad: (My Lord! Increase me in knowledge) and memorisation and understanding of the Qur'an as well as in judging by the Qur'an."
وَلَقَدْ عَهِدْنَآ إِلَىٰ ءَادَمَ مِن قَبْلُ فَنَسِيَ وَلَمْ نَجِدْ لَهُ عَزْماً,"(And verily We made a covenant of old) before he ate from the tree; it is also said that this means: before the advent of Muhammad (pbuh) (with Adam) We commanded him not to eat from the tree, (but he forgot) he left what he was commanded to do, (and We found no constancy in him) We found in him no firmness or resoluteness."
وَإِذْ قُلْنَا لِلْمَلاَئِكَةِ ٱسْجُدُواْ لأَدَمَ فَسَجَدُوۤاْ إِلاَّ إِبْلِيسَ أَبَىٰ,"(And when We said unto the angels) Who were on the earth: (Fall prostrate before Adam) a prostration of greeting, (they fell prostrate (all) save Iblis) their chief; (he refused) he felt too proud to prostrate before Adam."
فَقُلْنَا يآءَادَمُ إِنَّ هَـٰذَا عَدُوٌّ لَّكَ وَلِزَوْجِكَ فَلاَ يُخْرِجَنَّكُمَا مِنَ ٱلْجَنَّةِ فَتَشْقَىٰ,"(Therefore We said: O Adam! This is an enemy unto thee and unto your wife) Eve, (so let him not drive you both out of the Garden) if you obey him (so that thou come to toil) and toil as a consequence."
إِنَّ لَكَ أَلاَّ تَجُوعَ فِيهَا وَلاَ تَعْرَىٰ,"(It is (vouchsafed) unto thee that thou hungerest not therein) in Paradise (nor are naked,"
وَأَنَّكَ لاَ تَظْمَأُ فِيهَا وَلاَ تَضْحَىٰ,And that thou thirstest not therein nor are exposed to the sun's heat) He says: you are not going to sweat.
فَوَسْوَسَ إِلَيْهِ ٱلشَّيْطَانُ قَالَ يٰآدَمُ هَلْ أَدُلُّكَ عَلَىٰ شَجَرَةِ ٱلْخُلْدِ وَمُلْكٍ لاَّ يَبْلَىٰ,"(But the Devil whispered to him) to eat of the tree, (saying: O Adam! Shall I show thee the tree of immortality) whoever eats from it will live for ever and shall never die (and power that wasteth not away) and will remain holding on to a power that will never cease?"
فَأَكَلاَ مِنْهَا فَبَدَتْ لَهُمَا سَوْءَاتُهُمَا وَطَفِقَا يَخْصِفَانِ عَلَيْهِمَا مِن وَرَقِ ٱلْجَنَّةِ وَعَصَىٰ ءَادَمُ رَبَّهُ فَغَوَىٰ,"(Then they twain ate thereof) Adam and Eve ate from the tree, (so that their shame became apparent unto them) so that their nakedness appeared to them, (and they began) intentionally (to hide by heaping on themselves) by covering their nakedness with (some of the leaves of the Garden) some of the leaves of fig trees; whenever they put some on them, they fell off. (And Adam disobeyed his Lord) by eating from the tree, (so went astray) he left the way of guidance, and did not get what he wanted when he ate from the tree."
ثُمَّ ٱجْتَبَاهُ رَبُّهُ فَتَابَ عَلَيْهِ وَهَدَىٰ,"(Then his Lord chose him) by means of repentance, (and relented towards him) He overlooked his sin, (and guided him) to repentance."
قَالَ ٱهْبِطَا مِنْهَا جَمِيعاً بَعْضُكُمْ لِبَعْضٍ عَدُوٌّ فَإِمَّا يَأْتِيَنَّكُم مِّنِّي هُدًى فَمَنِ ٱتَّبَعَ هُدَايَ فَلاَ يَضِلُّ وَلاَ يَشْقَىٰ,"(He said: Go down hence) from Paradise, (both of you) along with serpent and the peacock, (one of you a foe unto the other) i.e. the children of Adam and the serpent are foes to one another. (But if there come unto you from Me a guidance) when it comes to you, O Children of Adam, guidance from Me: a Scripture and a Messenger, (then whoso followeth My guidance) My Scripture and Messenger, (he will not go astray) by following them in the life of this world (nor come to grief) in the Hereafter."
وَمَنْ أَعْرَضَ عَن ذِكْرِي فَإِنَّ لَهُ مَعِيشَةً ضَنكاً وَنَحْشُرُهُ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيامَةِ أَعْمَىٰ,"(But he who turneth away from remembrance of Me) but he who turns from professing My divine Oneness; it is also said that this means: he who disbelieves in My Scripture and Messenger, (his will be a narrow life) he will be exposed to a severe punishment in the grave; and it is also said: he will be exposed to a severe punishment in hell, (and I shall bring him blind to the assembly on the Day of Resurrection."
قَالَ رَبِّ لِمَ حَشَرْتَنِيۤ أَعْمَىٰ وَقَدْ كُنتُ بَصِيراً,"He will say: My Lord!) O my Lord! (Wherefore hast Thou gathered me (hither) blind, when I was wont to see) in the life of this world?"
قَالَ كَذٰلِكَ أَتَتْكَ آيَاتُنَا فَنَسِيتَهَا وَكَذٰلِكَ ٱلْيَوْمَ تُنْسَىٰ,(He will say: So (it must be)). Because (Our revelations) Our Scripture and Messenger (came unto thee but thou didst forget them) you abstained from believing in them or acting upon them. (In like manner thou art forgotten this Day) you will be left in hell.
وَكَذٰلِكَ نَجْزِي مَنْ أَسْرَفَ وَلَمْ يُؤْمِن بِآيَاتِ رَبِّهِ وَلَعَذَابُ ٱلآخِرَةِ أَشَدُّ وَأَبْقَىٰ,(Thus do We reward him who is prodigal) him who associates partners with Allah (and believeth not the revelations of his Lord) i.e. the Scripture and the Messenger; (and verily the doom of the Hereafter will be sterner and more lasting) than the torment of this worldly life.
أَفَلَمْ يَهْدِ لَهُمْ كَمْ أَهْلَكْنَا قَبْلَهُمْ مِّنَ ٱلْقُرُونِ يَمْشُونَ فِي مَسَاكِنِهِمْ إِنَّ فِي ذَلِكَ لآيَاتٍ لأُوْلِي ٱلنُّهَىٰ,"(Is it not a guidance for them (to know)) has it not been explained to the people of Mecca (how many a generation) past generations (We destroyed before them, amid whose dwellings they walk? Lo! Therein) in that which We did to them (verily are signs for men of thought) for men possessed of sound intellects."
وَلَوْلاَ كَلِمَةٌ سَبَقَتْ مِن رَّبِّكَ لَكَانَ لِزَاماً وَأَجَلٌ مُّسَمًّى,"(And but for a decree that had already gone forth from thy Lord) that their punishment shall be postponed, (and a term already fixed) for this nation, (the judgement would (have) been inevitable (in this world)) their punishment would have been inevitable."
فَٱصْبِرْ عَلَىٰ مَا يَقُولُونَ وَسَبِّحْ بِحَمْدِ رَبِّكَ قَبْلَ طُلُوعِ ٱلشَّمْسِ وَقَبْلَ غُرُوبِهَا وَمِنْ آنَآءِ ٱلْلَّيْلِ فَسَبِّحْ وَأَطْرَافَ ٱلنَّهَارِ لَعَلَّكَ تَرْضَىٰ,"(Therefore, bear with what they say) bear, O Muhammad, all their insults and denial; this verses was however abrogated by the verses of fighting, (and celebrate the praises of thy Lord) pray, O Muhammad, by the command of your Lord (ere the rising of the sun) the morning prayer (and ere the going down thereof. And glorify Him) pray the Maghrib and 'Isha' prayers (some hours of the night) after the advent of the night (and at the two ends of the day) the prayers of Zuhr and 'Asr, (that thou mayst find acceptance) that you may be given the intercession and be pleased thereby."
وَلاَ تَمُدَّنَّ عَيْنَيْكَ إِلَىٰ مَا مَتَّعْنَا بِهِ أَزْوَاجاً مِّنْهُمْ زَهْرَةَ ٱلْحَيَاةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا لِنَفْتِنَهُمْ فِيهِ وَرِزْقُ رَبِّكَ خَيْرٌ وَأَبْقَىٰ,"(And strain not your eyes) do not look out of desire (towards that which We cause some wedded pairs) men (among them) among the people of Banu Qurayzah and Banu'l-Nadir (to enjoy) wealth, (the flower of the life of the world) the adornment of this worldly life, (that We may try them thereby) that We may try them with that adornment which We have given them. (The provision of thy Lord) Paradise (is better and more lasting) than that which they have in this worldly life."
وَأْمُرْ أَهْلَكَ بِٱلصَّلاَةِ وَٱصْطَبِرْ عَلَيْهَا لاَ نَسْأَلُكَ رِزْقاً نَّحْنُ نَرْزُقُكَ وَٱلْعَاقِبَةُ لِلتَّقْوَىٰ,"(And enjoin upon thy people worship) in the time of hardship, (and be constant therein) be steadfast in prayer. (We ask not of thee a provision) We do not ask you to be the provider of yourself or your family: (We provide for thee. And the sequel is for righteousness) Paradise is for the person who wards off disbelief, idolatry and indecencies."
وَقَالُواْ لَوْلاَ يَأْتِينَا بِآيَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّهِ أَوَلَمْ تَأْتِهِمْ بَيِّنَةُ مَا فِي ٱلصُّحُفِ ٱلأُولَىٰ,(And they say) i.e. the people of Mecca: (If only he would bring us) why does not Muhammad bring us (a miracle) a sign (from his Lord! Hath there not come unto them the proof) the exposition (of what is in the former Scriptures) what is in the Torah and the Gospel for they contained the attributes and description of the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh)?
وَلَوْ أَنَّآ أَهْلَكْنَاهُمْ بِعَذَابٍ مِّن قَبْلِهِ لَقَالُواْ رَبَّنَا لَوْلاۤ أَرْسَلْتَ إِلَيْنَا رَسُولاً فَنَتَّبِعَ آيَاتِكَ مِن قَبْلِ أَن نَّذِلَّ وَنَخْزَىٰ,"(And if We had destroyed them) i.e. the people of Mecca (with some punishment before it) before the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) came with the Qur'an, (they would assuredly have said) on the Day of Judgement: (Our Lord!) O our Lord! (If only Thou hadst sent unto us) why did You not send us (a messenger, so that we might have followed Your revelations) so that we you follow your Messenger and believe in Your Book (before we were (thus) humbled) before we were killed at Badr (and disgraced!) and tormented by the torment of the Day of Judgement."
قُلْ كُلٌّ مُّتَرَبِّصٌ فَتَرَبَّصُواْ فَسَتَعْلَمُونَ مَنْ أَصْحَابُ ٱلصِّرَاطِ ٱلسَّوِيِّ وَمَنِ ٱهْتَدَىٰ,"(Say) to them, O Muhammad: (Each) one of us and you (is awaiting) the destruction of his opponent; (so await ye! Ye will come to know) upon the advent of chastisement on the Day of Judgement (who are the owners of the path of equity) the path of justice, (and who is right) and who among us is guided to faith'."
ٱقْتَرَبَ لِلنَّاسِ حِسَابُهُمْ وَهُمْ فِي غَفْلَةٍ مُّعْرِضُونَ,"And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas who said regarding the meaning of Allah, Exalted is He, saying: (Their reckoning draweth nigh for mankind): He says: the chastisement that the people of Mecca were promised in the Book has drawn near, (while they turn away in heedlessness) while they are oblivious to it; they have disbelieved in and discarded it."
مَا يَأْتِيهِمْ مِّن ذِكْرٍ مِّن رَّبِّهِمْ مُّحْدَثٍ إِلاَّ ٱسْتَمَعُوهُ وَهُمْ يَلْعَبُونَ,"(Never cometh there unto them) whenever Gabriel comes to their Prophet with (a new reminder from their Lord) i.e. the Qur'an: verse after verse and surah after surah, as if the coming of Gabriel, time after time, and the recitation of Muhammad (pbuh) and their listening to it are new, not that the Qur'an is new, (but they listen to it while they play) while they mock Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an."
لاَهِيَةً قُلُوبُهُمْ وَأَسَرُّواْ ٱلنَّجْوَى ٱلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ هَلْ هَـٰذَآ إِلاَّ بَشَرٌ مِّثْلُكُمْ أَفَتَأْتُونَ ٱلسِّحْرَ وَأَنتُمْ تُبْصِرُونَ,(With hearts preoccupied) with hearts heedless of the matter of the Hereafter. (And they confer in secret) they hide among themselves their disbelief in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an. (The wrong-doers) these are the idolaters: Abu Jahl and his host; they say to one another: (say: Is this) they mean Muhammad (pbuh) (other than a mortal like you) other than a human being like you? (Will ye then succumb to magic) will you then believe in magic and lies (when ye see (it)) while knowing that it is magic and lies?
قَالَ رَبِّي يَعْلَمُ ٱلْقَوْلَ فِي ٱلسَّمَآءِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَهُوَ ٱلسَّمِيعُ ٱلْعَلِيمُ,"(He saith) Muhammad (s)ays to them: (My Lord knoweth what is spoken in the heaven and the earth) Allah knows the secret words that the dwellers of the heaven and the earth say and the secret works they do. (He is the Hearer) of what Abu Jahl and his host say, (the Knower) of Abu Jahl and his host as well as of their punishment."
بَلْ قَالُوۤاْ أَضْغَاثُ أَحْلاَمٍ بَلِ ٱفْتَرَاهُ بَلْ هُوَ شَاعِرٌ فَلْيَأْتِنَا بِآيَةٍ كَمَآ أُرْسِلَ ٱلأَوَّلُونَ,"(Nay, say they) some of them say, ((these are but) muddled dreams) false dreams, that which Muhammad (pbuh) brought to us is but false dreams; (nay, he hath but invented it) some others say: Muhammad (pbuh) invented the Qur'an; (nay, he is but a poet) some of them said: no, he is a poet. (Let him bring us a portent) a sign (even as those of old (who were God's messengers) were sent (with portents)) just as the messengers of old were sent with signs to their people, as he claims."
مَآ آمَنَتْ قَبْلَهُمْ مِّن قَرْيَةٍ أَهْلَكْنَاهَآ أَفَهُمْ يُؤْمِنُونَ,"Allah then says: (Not a township) not a single population of a township (believed of those which We destroyed) when they disbelieved in the signs (before them) before your people: (would they then believe) would your people then believe in the signs? Nay, they will not."
وَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَا قَبْلَكَ إِلاَّ رِجَالاً نُّوحِيۤ إِلَيْهِمْ فَاسْئَلُوۤاْ أَهْلَ ٱلذِّكْرِ إِن كُنتُمْ لاَ تَعْلَمُونَ,(And We sent not (as Our messengers) before you other than men) human beings like you (whom We inspired) to whom We sent angels just as We have sent to you. (Ask the followers of the Reminder) the people of the Torah and the Gospel (if you know not) that Allah sent only human messengers?
وَمَا جَعَلْنَاهُمْ جَسَداً لاَّ يَأْكُلُونَ ٱلطَّعَامَ وَمَا كَانُواْ خَالِدِينَ,"(We gave them not) i.e. the Prophet (bodies that would not eat food) or drink, (nor were they immortals) in this worldly life. Rather, they ate and drank and died. This verse was revealed about the people of Mecca when they said: how come this Messenger eats food and walks in the marketplace?"
ثُمَّ صَدَقْنَاهُمُ ٱلْوَعْدَ فَأَنجَيْنَاهُمْ وَمَن نَّشَآءُ وَأَهْلَكْنَا ٱلْمُسْرفِينَ,"(Then We fulfilled the promise unto them) We fulfilled the promise given to the prophets that they will be saved. (So We delivered them) i.e. the prophets (and whom We would) and those who believed in the prophets, (and We destroyed the prodigals) and We destroyed the idolaters."
لَقَدْ أَنزَلْنَآ إِلَيْكُمْ كِتَاباً فِيهِ ذِكْرُكُمْ أَفَلاَ تَعْقِلُونَ,(Now We have revealed unto you) unto your Prophet (a Scripture) We sent Gabriel with a Scripture (wherein is your Reminder) wherein lies your eminence and dignity if you believe in it. (Have ye then no sense) do you not believe then in your eminence and dignity?
وَكَمْ قَصَمْنَا مِن قَرْيَةٍ كَانَتْ ظَالِمَةً وَأَنشَأْنَا بَعْدَهَا قَوْماً آخَرِينَ,"(How many a community that dealt unjustly) whose people were disbelievers and idolaters (have We shattered) have We destroyed, (and raised up) and created (after them) after their destruction (another folk) who lived in their habitations!"
فَلَمَّآ أَحَسُّواْ بَأْسَنَآ إِذَا هُمْ مِّنْهَا يَرْكُضُونَ,"(And, when they felt Our might) when they saw Our chastisement which was to destroy them, (behold them fleeing from it) they run away from Our might!"
لاَ تَرْكُضُواْ وَٱرْجِعُوۤاْ إِلَىٰ مَآ أُتْرِفْتُمْ فِيهِ وَمَسَاكِنِكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُسْأَلُونَ,"The angels said to them: (Flee not) do not run away, (but return to that (existence) which emasculated you) return to the comfort which you enjoyed (and to your dwellings) and to your houses, (that ye may be questioned) about faith; it is also said that this means: that you may be asked about the killing of the Prophet (pbuh)."
قَالُواْ يٰوَيْلَنَآ إِنَّا كُنَّا ظَالِمِينَ,(They cried) when they were being killed and tormented: (Alas for us! Lo! we were wrong-doers) when we killed our Prophet.
فَمَا زَالَت تِلْكَ دَعْوَاهُمْ حَتَّىٰ جَعَلْنَاهُمْ حَصِيداً خَامِدِينَ,"(And this their crying) i.e. saying "" Alas for us! "" (ceased not till We made them as reaped corn, extinct) dead, motionless. This is the story of a township near Yemen called "" Hudur "". Allah sent a prophet to them but they killed him. Allah set on them Nebuchadnezzar who exterminated them."
وَمَا خَلَقْنَا ٱلسَّمَآءَ وَٱلأَرْضَ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا لَـٰعِبِينَ,(We created not the heaven and the earth and all that is between them) of created beings (in play) without ordaining commands and prohibitions.
لَوْ أَرَدْنَآ أَن نَّتَّخِذَ لَهْواً لاَّتَّخَذْنَاهُ مِن لَّدُنَّآ إِن كُنَّا فَاعِلِينَ,"Then Allah revealed the following, when they said that the angels are Allah's daughters: (If We had wished to find a pastime) if We wished to have daughters; and it is said that this means: if We wished to have a wife; and it is also said that this means: if We wished to have children, (We could have found it in Our presence) from Us from among the maidens of Paradise (if We ever did) and We will never do this."
بَلْ نَقْذِفُ بِٱلْحَقِّ عَلَى ٱلْبَاطِلِ فَيَدْمَغُهُ فَإِذَا هُوَ زَاهِقٌ وَلَكُمُ ٱلْوَيْلُ مِمَّا تَصِفُونَ,"(Nay, but We hurl the true) We cast the Truth (against the false) upon falsehood; it is also said: We exposit the Truth and falsehood, (and it doth break its head) and it makes it perish (and lo! it vanisheth) i.e. falsehood. (And yours) O group of disbelievers (will be woe) severe punishment (for that which ye ascribe (unto Him)) for your claim that the angels are Allah's daughters."
وَلَهُ مَن فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَمَنْ عِنْدَهُ لاَ يَسْتَكْبِرُونَ عَنْ عِبَادَتِهِ وَلاَ يَسْتَحْسِرُونَ,(Unto Him belongeth whosoever is in the heavens and the earth) all created beings are His slaves. (And those who dwell in His presence) among the angels (are not too proud to worship Him) they are not too proud to obey Him and acknowledge His Lordship (nor do they weary) and they do not tire from worshipping Allah;
يُسَبِّحُونَ ٱلَّيلَ وَٱلنَّهَارَ لاَ يَفْتُرُونَ,(They glorify (Him) night and day) they pray to Him at night and during the day; (they flag not) they do not get bored of worshipping Allah and of acknowledging His Lordship.
أَمِ ٱتَّخَذُوۤاْ آلِهَةً مِّنَ ٱلأَرْضِ هُمْ يُنشِرُونَ,"(Or have they chosen) or have they, i.e. the people of Mecca, worshipped (gods from the earth) on the earth (who raise the dead) or create human beings?"
لَوْ كَانَ فِيهِمَآ آلِهَةٌ إِلاَّ ٱللَّهُ لَفَسَدَتَا فَسُبْحَانَ ٱللَّهِ رَبِّ ٱلْعَرْشِ عَمَّا يَصِفُونَ,"(If there were therein) in the heavens and earth (Gods beside Allah) other than Allah, (then verily both had been disordered) the dwellers of the heavens and the earth would have been destroyed. (Glorified be Allah, the Lord of the Throne, from all that they ascribe (unto Him)) from the children and partners they ascribe to Allah."
لاَ يُسْأَلُ عَمَّا يَفْعَلُ وَهُمْ يُسْأَلُونَ,"(He will not be questioned as to that which He doeth) Allah will not be questioned about what He says, commands or does, (but they will be questioned) and the servants will be asked about what they say and do."
أَمِ ٱتَّخَذُواْ مِن دُونِهِ آلِهَةً قُلْ هَاتُواْ بُرْهَانَكُمْ هَـٰذَا ذِكْرُ مَن مَّعِيَ وَذِكْرُ مَن قَبْلِي بَلْ أَكْثَرُهُمْ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ ٱلْحَقَّ فَهُمْ مُّعْرِضُونَ,"(Or have they chosen) or have they worshipped (other gods) idols (beside Him) beside Allah? (Say) to them, O Muhammad: (Bring your proof (of their godhead)) bring your proofs for the validity of their worship. (This) i.e. the Qur'an (is the Reminder of those with me) is the events of those with me (and those before me) and the events of those who were before among the believers and disbelievers, and it does not contain that Allah has children or partners, (but most of them) all of them (know not the Truth) nor believe in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an (and so they are averse) they disbelieve in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an."
وَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رَّسُولٍ إِلاَّ نُوحِيۤ إِلَيْهِ أَنَّهُ لاۤ إِلَـٰهَ إِلاَّ أَنَاْ فَٱعْبُدُونِ,"(And We sent no messenger before you) O Muhammad (but We inspired him) tell your people that they should say: (There is no God save Me (Allah), so worship Me) so declare My divine Oneness."
وَقَالُواْ ٱتَّخَذَ ٱلرَّحْمَـٰنُ وَلَداً سُبْحَانَهُ بَلْ عِبَادٌ مُّكْرَمُونَ,"(And they say) i.e. the people of Mecca: (The Beneficent hath taken unto Himself a child) angels as daughters. (Be He glorified!) Allah exonerated Himself from having children or partners (Nay, but are honoured slaves) rather they are, i.e. the angels, are servants whom Allah has honoured with obeying Him;"
لاَ يَسْبِقُونَهُ بِٱلْقَوْلِ وَهُمْ بِأَمْرِهِ يَعْمَلُونَ,"(They speak not until He hath spoken) Gabriel does not go ahead of Michael, whether by words or acts, until He commands him, (and they act by His command) and they, i.e. the angels, say and do in accordance with Allah's command."
يَعْلَمُ مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ وَلاَ يَشْفَعُونَ إِلاَّ لِمَنِ ٱرْتَضَىٰ وَهُمْ مِّنْ خَشْيَتِهِ مُشْفِقُونَ,"(He knoweth what is before them) of the matter of the Hereafter (and what is behind them) of the matter of this worldly life, (and they) i.e. the angels (cannot intercede) on the Day of Judgement (except for him whom He accepteth) except for those who profess Allah's divine Oneness and with whose monotheism Allah is pleased, (and they quake for awe of Him) among those who fear Him."
وَمَن يَقُلْ مِنْهُمْ إِنِّيۤ إِلَـٰهٌ مِّن دُونِهِ فَذٰلِكَ نَجْزِيهِ جَهَنَّمَ كَذَلِكَ نَجْزِي ٱلظَّالِمِينَ,"(And one of them) of the angels; and it is said this means: of created beings (who should say: Lo! I am a God beside Him) beside Allah, (that one We should repay with hell) Hell will be his lot because of this. (Thus We repay wrong-doers) thus We repay disbelievers."
أَوَلَمْ يَرَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوۤاْ أَنَّ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضَ كَانَتَا رَتْقاً فَفَتَقْنَاهُمَا وَجَعَلْنَا مِنَ ٱلْمَآءِ كُلَّ شَيْءٍ حَيٍّ أَفَلاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ,"(Have not those who disbelieve) in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an (known that the heavens and the earth were of one piece) We did not send down to it a drop of rain or grow vegetation on the earth which were aligned with each other (then We parted them) and then separated them and singled them out from each other through rain and plants, (and We made every living thing of water) We made of water from the male and female everything that requires water? (Will they) i.e. the people of Mecca (not then believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an?"
وَجَعَلْنَا فِي ٱلأَرْضِ رَوَاسِيَ أَن تَمِيدَ بِهِمْ وَجَعَلْنَا فِيهَا فِجَاجاً سُبُلاً لَّعَلَّهُمْ يَهْتَدُونَ,"(And We have placed in the earth firm hills) the mountains as pillars for it (lest it quake with them) lest the earth trembles with them on it, (and We have placed therein) in the earth (ravines) valleys (as roads) as spacious roads (that haply they may find their way) in their goings and comings."
وَجَعَلْنَا ٱلسَّمَآءَ سَقْفاً مَّحْفُوظاً وَهُمْ عَنْ آيَاتِهَا مُعْرِضُونَ,"(And We have made the sky a roof) for the earth (withheld (from them)) such that it does not fall; it is also said that this means: it is protected from the satans by the stars. (Yet they) i.e. the people of Mecca (turn away from) they do not believe nor reflect upon (its portents) its sun, moon and stars."
وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِي خَلَقَ ٱلْلَّيْلَ وَٱلنَّهَارَ وَٱلشَّمْسَ وَٱلْقَمَرَ كُلٌّ فِي فَلَكٍ يَسْبَحُونَ,"(And He it is Who created the night and the day, and the sun and the moon) He made the sun and the moon subservient. (They float, each in an orbit) each one of them rotate around its orbit."
وَمَا جَعَلْنَا لِبَشَرٍ مِّن قَبْلِكَ ٱلْخُلْدَ أَفَإِنْ مِّتَّ فَهُمُ ٱلْخَالِدُونَ,"(We appointed) We have created (immortality) in this worldly life (for no mortal) among the prophets (before thee. What! if thou diest) O Muhammad, (can they be immortal) in this worldly life? This verse was revealed when they said: we will wait until Muhammad dies and then we will find rest."
كُلُّ نَفْسٍ ذَآئِقَةُ ٱلْمَوْتِ وَنَبْلُوكُم بِٱلشَّرِّ وَٱلْخَيْرِ فِتْنَةً وَإِلَيْنَا تُرْجَعُونَ,"(Every soul) that is possessed of breath (must taste of death, and We try you) We test you (with evil and with good) with hardship and comfort, (for ordeal) both are a test from Allah. (And unto Us ye will be returned) after you die and then He will requite you for your works."
وَإِذَا رَآكَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوۤاْ إِن يَتَّخِذُونَكَ إِلاَّ هُزُواً أَهَـٰذَا ٱلَّذِي يَذْكُرُ آلِهَتَكُمْ وَهُمْ بِذِكْرِ ٱلرَّحْمَـٰنِ هُمْ كَافِرُونَ,"(And when those who disbelieve) Abu Jahl and his host (behold thee) O Muhammad, (they but choose thee) O Muhammad (out for mockery) in what they say to you, ((saying)) to one another: (Is this he who maketh mention of) is this he who ridicules (your gods? And they would deny all mention of the Beneficent) they deny the Beneficent, saying: we do not know anyone by the name of the Beneficent (al-Rahman) except Musaylimah, the liar."
خُلِقَ ٱلإنْسَانُ مِنْ عَجَلٍ سَأُوْرِيكُمْ آيَاتِي فَلاَ تَسْتَعْجِلُونِ,"(Man) i.e. Adam (is made of haste) he is hasty; it is also said that this means: man, al-Nadr Ibn al-Harth, was created hasty, for he wanted chastisement to be hastened for him. (I shall show you My portents) I shall show you the signs of My divine Oneness in the horizons; it is also said that this means: I will show the signs of My punishment of you through the sword on the Day of Badr, (but ask Me not to hasten) My chastisement before its appointed time."
وَيَقُولُونَ مَتَىٰ هَـٰذَا ٱلْوَعْدُ إِن كُنتُمْ صَادِقِينَ,"(And they say) i.e. the disbelievers of Mecca: (When will this promise) that you have promised us, O Muhammad, ((be fulfilled), if ye are truthful?)"
لَوْ يَعْلَمُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ حِينَ لاَ يَكُفُّونَ عَن وُجُوهِهِمُ ٱلنَّارَ وَلاَ عَن ظُهُورِهِمْ وَلاَ هُمْ يُنصَرُونَ,"(If those who disbelieved) if those who disbelieved in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an knew the chastisement awaiting them, they would not ask for it to be hastened, (but knew the time when they will not be able to drive off) when the chastisement comes, they will not be able to push away (the Fire from their faces and from their backs, and they will not be helped) to drive away the chastisement!"
بَلْ تَأْتِيهِم بَغْتَةً فَتَبْهَتُهُمْ فَلاَ يَسْتَطِيعُونَ رَدَّهَا وَلاَ هُمْ يُنظَرُونَ,"(Nay, but it) the Last Hour (will come upon them unawares) suddenly (so that it will stupefy them) so it will take them by surprise, (and they will be unable to repel it) from themselves, (neither will they be reprieved) nor will their chastisement be postponed."
وَلَقَدِ ٱسْتُهْزِىءَ بِرُسُلٍ مِّن قَبْلِكَ فَحَاقَ بِٱلَّذِينَ سَخِرُواْ مِنْهُمْ مَّا كَانُواْ بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِئُونَ,"(Messengers before thee, indeed, were mocked) the messengers who came before you, O Muhammad, were mocked by their people just as your people are mocking you, (but that whereat they mocked) the chastisement they mocked; it is also said that this means: they were chastised because of their mockery, (surrounded) was decreed and came down upon (those who scoffed at them) those who mocked the prophets."
قُلْ مَن يَكْلَؤُكُم بِٱلْلَّيْلِ وَٱلنَّهَارِ مِنَ ٱلرَّحْمَـٰنِ بَلْ هُمْ عَن ذِكْرِ رَبِّهِمْ مُّعْرِضُونَ,"(Say) O Muhammad to the people of Mecca: (Who guardeth you) who protects you (in the night or in the day from the Beneficent) from the chastisement of the Beneficent? It is also said that this means: who protects you from the punishment of other than the Beneficent? (Nay, but they turn away from) but they disbelieve and discard the (the mention of their Lord) from the profession of Allah's divine Oneness and the Scripture of their Lord,"
أَمْ لَهُمْ آلِهَةٌ تَمْنَعُهُمْ مِّن دُونِنَا لاَ يَسْتَطِيعُونَ نَصْرَ أَنْفُسِهِمْ وَلاَ هُمْ مِّنَّا يُصْحَبُونَ,"(Or have they gods) or do they have deities (who can shield them from Us) from Our chastisement? (They cannot help themselves) they, these gods, cannot drive away chastisement from themselves, so how can they drive it away from others? (nor can they be defended from Us) nor are they going to receive immunity from Our chastisement, so how can they give immunity to others?"
بَلْ مَتَّعْنَا هَـٰؤُلاۤءِ وَآبَآءَهُمْ حَتَّىٰ طَالَ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلْعُمُرُ أَفَلاَ يَرَوْنَ أَنَّا نَأْتِي ٱلأَرْضَ نَنقُصُهَا مِنْ أَطْرَافِهَآ أَفَهُمُ ٱلْغَالِبُونَ,"(Nay, but We gave these) the people of Mecca (and their fathers) before them (ease) a reprieve (until life grew long for them) until their lifespan grew long for them. (See they) i.e. the people of Mecca (not how we visit the land) how We seize the land, (reducing it) conquering it, for Muhammad (of its outlying parts) from its sides? (Can they then be the victors) are they then going to be victorious over Muhammad (pbuh)?"
قُلْ إِنَّمَآ أُنذِرُكُم بِٱلْوَحْيِ وَلاَ يَسْمَعُ ٱلصُّمُّ ٱلدُّعَآءَ إِذَا مَا يُنذَرُونَ,"(Say) to them, O Muhammad: (I warn you only by the Inspiration) by that which is revealed of the Qur'an. (But the deaf hear not the call when they are warned) but you cannot make hear he who pretends not to hear Allah's call."
وَلَئِن مَّسَّتْهُمْ نَفْحَةٌ مِّنْ عَذَابِ رَبِّكَ لَيَقُولُنَّ يٰويْلَنَآ إِنَّا كُنَّا ظَالِمِينَ,"(And if a breath of thy Lord's punishment were to touch them, they assuredly would say: Alas for us! Lo! we were wrong-doers) against ourselves, and we were disbelievers in Allah."
وَنَضَعُ ٱلْمَوَازِينَ ٱلْقِسْطَ لِيَوْمِ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ فَلاَ تُظْلَمُ نَفْسٌ شَيْئاً وَإِن كَانَ مِثْقَالَ حَبَّةٍ مِّنْ خَرْدَلٍ أَتَيْنَا بِهَا وَكَفَىٰ بِنَا حَاسِبِينَ,"(And We set a just balance for the Day of Resurrection) on the Day of Judgement, there will be a balance which will weigh only good and bad works (so that no soul is wronged in aught) no one will have his good works diminished nor his evil works increased. (Though it be of the weight of a grain of mustard seed, We bring it) We requite for it. (And We suffice for reckoners) We are enough as Preserver and Knower."
وَلَقَدْ آتَيْنَا مُوسَىٰ وَهَارُونَ ٱلْفُرْقَانَ وَضِيَآءً وَذِكْراً لَّلْمُتَّقِينَ,"(And We verily gave Moses and Aaron the Criterion) the deliverer from dubious matters; it is also said that the Criterion means: victory and the upper hand over Pharaoh (and a light) which shows error (and a Reader) and an admonition (for those who keep from evil) for those who ward off idolatry, disbelief and indecencies."
ٱلَّذِينَ يَخْشَوْنَ رَبَّهُمْ بِٱلْغَيْبِ وَهُمْ مِّنَ ٱلسَّاعَةِ مُشْفِقُونَ,(Those who fear their Lord) those who work for their Lord (in secret) even if He is invisible to them (and who dread the Hour) and who dread the chastisement of the Last Day.

وَلَقَدْ آتَيْنَآ إِبْرَاهِيمَ رُشْدَهُ مِن قَبْلُ وَكُنَّا بِهِ عَالِمِينَ,"(And We verily gave Abraham of old) before he reached the age of puberty; it is also said that this means: We honoured him with prophethood before Moses and Aaron; and it said that this means: before Muhammad (pbuh) (his proper course) i.e. knowledge and understanding, (and We were Aware of him) i.e. that he deserved it,"
إِذْ قَالَ لأَبِيهِ وَقَوْمِهِ مَا هَـٰذِهِ ٱلتَّمَاثِيلُ ٱلَّتِيۤ أَنتُمْ لَهَا عَاكِفُونَ,(When he said unto his father) Azar (and his folk) Nimrod son of Canaan and his host: (What are these images unto which ye pay devotion) which you worship?
قَالُواْ وَجَدْنَآ آبَآءَنَا لَهَا عَابِدِينَ,(They said: We found our fathers worshippers of them) and so we worship them.
قَالَ لَقَدْ كُنتُمْ أَنتُمْ وَآبَآؤُكُمْ فِي ضَلاَلٍ مُّبِينٍ,(He said) Abraham said to them: (Verily ye and your fathers) before you (were in plain error) in disbelief and manifest error.
قَالُوۤاْ أَجِئْتَنَا بِٱلْحَقِّ أَمْ أَنتَ مِنَ ٱللاَّعِبِينَ,"(They said) to Abraham: (Bringest thou unto us the Truth) is what you say serious, O Abraham, (or art thou some jester) or are you mocking us?"
قَالَ بَل رَّبُّكُمْ رَبُّ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ ٱلَّذِي فطَرَهُنَّ وَأَنَاْ عَلَىٰ ذٰلِكُمْ مِّنَ ٱلشَّاهِدِينَ,"(He said) Abraham said: (Nay, but your Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, Who created them; and I am of those who testify unto that) to what I have said."
وَتَٱللَّهِ لأَكِيدَنَّ أَصْنَامَكُمْ بَعْدَ أَن تُوَلُّواْ مُدْبِرِينَ,"(And, by Allah) he said this to himself, (I shall circumvent) I shall demolish (your idols after ye have gone away and turned your backs) to go to the festival."
فَجَعَلَهُمْ جُذَاذاً إِلاَّ كَبِيراً لَّهُمْ لَعَلَّهُمْ إِلَيْهِ يَرْجِعُونَ,"When they went to their festival and they left Abraham behind in their township, he went to the house of their idols. (Then he reduced them to fragments) he destroyed them, (all save the chief of them) he left it intact, (that haply they might have recourse to it) after coming back from their festival and he could say that it was it that did it."
قَالُواْ مَن فَعَلَ هَـٰذَا بِآلِهَتِنَآ إِنَّهُ لَمِنَ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ,They entered the house of their idols. (They said: Who hath done this to our gods? Surely it must be some evil-doer) he committed an evil deed against our deities.
قَالُواْ سَمِعْنَا فَتًى يَذْكُرُهُمْ يُقَالُ لَهُ إِبْرَاهِيمُ,"(They said) a man among them said: (We heard a youth make mention of them) speaking ill of them and mentioning that he will break them, (who is called Abraham)."
قَالُواْ فَأْتُواْ بِهِ عَلَىٰ أَعْيُنِ ٱلنَّاسِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَشْهَدُونَ,(They said) Nimrod said to them: (Then bring him (hither) before the people's eyes) in the presence of people (that they may testify) that he did it; and it is said that this means: that they may testify that he said he will demolish them; and it is also said that this means: that they may witness his punishment.
قَالُوۤاْ أَأَنْتَ فَعَلْتَ هَـٰذَا بِآلِهَتِنَا يٰإِبْرَاهِيمُ,"(They said) Nimrod said to him: (Is it thou who hast done this) i.e. breaking them (to our gods, O Abraham?"
قَالَ بَلْ فَعَلَهُ كَبِيرُهُمْ هَـٰذَا فَاسْأَلُوهُمْ إِن كَانُواْ يِنْطِقُونَ,"He said) Abraham said: (But this, their chief) who has the axe on its shoulder (hath done it. So question them, if they can speak) so that they can inform you who broke them."
فَرَجَعُوۤاْ إِلَىٰ أَنفُسِهِمْ فَقَالُوۤاْ إِنَّكُمْ أَنتُمُ ٱلظَّالِمُونَ,(Then gathered they apart) blaming themselves (and said) and their king Nimrod said: (Lo! ye yourselves are the wrong-doers) towards Abraham.
ثُمَّ نُكِسُواْ عَلَىٰ رُءُوسِهِمْ لَقَدْ عَلِمْتَ مَا هَـٰؤُلاۤءِ يَنطِقُونَ,"(And they were utterly confounded) and went back to their initial statement, (and they said) Nimrod said: (Well thou knowest) O Abraham (that these speak not) that the idols do not speak, and this is why you broke them."
قَالَ أَفَتَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ مَا لاَ يَنفَعُكُمْ شَيْئاً وَلاَ يَضُرُّكُمْ,"(He said) Abraham said: (Worship ye then instead of Allah that which cannot profit you at all) if you worshipped it, (nor harm you) if you did not worship it?"
أُفٍّ لَّكُمْ وَلِمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ أَفَلاَ تَعْقِلُونَ,(Fie on you and all that ye worship instead of Allah! Have ye then no sense) do you not then have the common sense that human beings have? It does not befit one to worship something that does not benefit or harm.
قَالُواْ حَرِّقُوهُ وَٱنصُرُوۤاْ آلِهَتَكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ فَاعِلِينَ,"(They cried) their king Nimrod said to them: (Burn him) in the Fire (and stand by your gods) and avenge your deities, (if ye will be doing) something to him; and they threw him in the Fire."
قُلْنَا يٰنَارُ كُونِي بَرْداً وَسَلَٰماً عَلَىٰ إِبْرَاهِيمَ,"(We said: O fire, be coolness) against your heat (and peace) and safety from your coolness (for Abraham) for if Allah did not say "" peace "" the coolness of the Fire would have harmed him."
وَأَرَادُواْ بِهِ كَيْداً فَجَعَلْنَاهُمُ ٱلأَخْسَرِينَ,"(And they wished to set a snare for him) i.e. to burn him, (but We made them the greater losers) the ones who were humbled."

(Lo! he was of the righteous) in his religion, and was one of the messengers."
وَنُوحاً إِذْ نَادَىٰ مِن قَبْلُ فَٱسْتَجَبْنَا لَهُ فَنَجَّيْنَاهُ وَأَهْلَهُ مِنَ ٱلْكَرْبِ ٱلْعَظِيمِ,"(And Noah) We also honoured him with prophethood, (when he cried) when he prayed to his Lord to destroy his people (of old) before Lot, (We heard his prayer and saved him and his household) as well as those who believed in him (from the great affliction) i.e. from drowning."
وَنَصَرْنَاهُ مِنَ ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلَّذِينَ كَذَّبُواْ بِآيَاتِنَا إِنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ قَوْمَ سَوْءٍ فَأَغْرَقْنَاهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ,"(And delivered him from the people who denied Our revelations) who disbelieved in Our Scripture and Messenger Noah. (Lo! they were folk of evil) in their state of disbelief, (therefore did We drown them all) by the flood."
وَدَاوُودَ وَسُلَيْمَانَ إِذْ يَحْكُمَانِ فِي ٱلْحَرْثِ إِذْ نَفَشَتْ فِيهِ غَنَمُ ٱلْقَوْمِ وَكُنَّا لِحُكْمِهِمْ شَاهِدِينَ,"(And David and Solomon) We also honoured them with prophethood and wisdom, (when they gave judgement concerning the field) the vineyard of the people, (when people's sheep) other people's sheep (had strayed and browsed therein by night; and We were witnesses to) We had knowledge of (their judgement) the judgement of David and Solomon."
فَفَهَّمْنَاهَا سُلَيْمَانَ وَكُلاًّ آتَيْنَا حُكْماً وَعِلْماً وَسَخَّرْنَا مَعَ دَاوُودَ ٱلْجِبَالَ يُسَبِّحْنَ وَٱلطَّيْرَ وَكُنَّا فَاعِلِينَ,(And We made Solomon to understand) gentleness in judgement; (and unto each of them) David and Solomon (We gave judgement) understanding (and knowledge) prophethood. (And We subdued the hills and the birds to hymn (His) praise along with David) when he praised his Lord. (We were the doers (thereof)) We did that to them.
وَعَلَّمْنَاهُ صَنْعَةَ لَبُوسٍ لَّكُمْ لِتُحْصِنَكُمْ مِّن بَأْسِكُمْ فَهَلْ أَنتُمْ شَاكِرُونَ,"(And We taught him the art of making garments (of mail)) the art of making armours (to protect you in your daring) to protect you from the weapons of your enemy.

We have created you from dust) We have created you from Adam and Adam is from dust, (then) We created you after that (from a drop of seed, then from a clot) of blood after the drop of semen, (then from a little lump of flesh) after the clot of blood (shapely) in a perfect shape (and shapeless) when miscarriage takes place, (that We may make (it) clean for you) in the Qur'an after you are created. (And We cause what We will) of unborn children (to remain in the wombs) preventing it from miscarriage; and it is also said that this means: We leave it in the wombs (for an appointed time) for a certain number of months, (and afterward We bring you forth) from the wombs (as infants, then (give you growth) that ye attain your full strength) from the age of 18 to the age of 30 years old.

This was revealed about the Banu'l-Hallaf, the hypocrites of the Banu Asad and Ghatafan, (so that if good) a bounty (befalleth him he is content therewith) he is pleased with the religion of Muhammad (pbuh) but just with his tongue, (but if a trial) hardship (befalleth him, he falleth away utterly) he reverts to his first religion: associating partners with Allah. (He loseth both the world) by missing the life of this world (and the Hereafter) by losing Paradise. (That is the sheer loss) the loss of both this worldly life and the Hereafter."

Lo! Allah doth what He intendeth) whether it is bestowing bliss or inflicting damnation. This was also revealed about them when they said: we are afraid that Muhammad does not triumph in this world and, thus, we would loose the affinity existing between us and the Jews."
مَن كَانَ يَظُنُّ أَن لَّن يَنصُرَهُ ٱللَّهُ فِي ٱلدُّنْيَا وَٱلآخِرَةِ فَلْيَمْدُدْ بِسَبَبٍ إِلَى ٱلسَّمَآءِ ثُمَّ لْيَقْطَعْ فَلْيَنْظُرْ هَلْ يُذْهِبَنَّ كَيْدُهُ مَا يَغِيظُ,"(Whoso is wont to think that Allah will not give him) i.e. Muhammad (pbuh) (victory in the world and the Hereafter) through reason and proof, (let him stretch a rope up to the roof (of his dwelling), and let him hang himself.

It is also said that there is another way of understanding this passage: whoever thinks that Allah will not help him in this worldly life with sustenance and in the Hereafter with reward, then let him tie a rope to the roof of his house, hang himself with it and see whether killing himself will dispel his rage regarding sustenance."

(Then eat thereof) eat from the beasts of cattle you immolated (and feed therewith the poor unfortunate)."

(The cattle) the immolated cattle and the eating of their meat (are lawful unto you save that which has been told you) in Surah al-Ma'idah such as carrion, blood and pork. (So shun the filth of idols) so leave the drinking of intoxicants and the worship of idols, (and shun lying speech) and abstain from uttering falsehood and lies. This is because they used to say during their pilgrimage in the pre-Islamic time: "" here we are, O Lord, here we are, you have no partners except for a partner that you possess and it possesses not "" , and so Allah forbade them from saying this."
حُنَفَآءَ للَّهِ غَيْرَ مُشْرِكِينَ بِهِ وَمَن يُشْرِكْ بِٱللَّهِ فَكَأَنَّمَا خَرَّ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ فَتَخْطَفُهُ ٱلطَّيْرُ أَوْ تَهْوِي بِهِ ٱلرِّيحُ فِي مَكَانٍ سَحِيقٍ,"(Turning unto Allah (only)) be sincere to Allah in your chanting and pilgrimage, (not ascribing partners unto Him) in your chanting or pilgrimage; (for whoso ascribeth partners unto Allah, it is as if he had fallen from the sky and the birds had snatched him) to take him wherever they wish (or the wind had blown him to a far-off place)."

(Therein) in these sacrifices (ye have much good) you have much reward. (So mention the name of Allah over them when they are drawn up in lines) when you immolate them, and let them be free of defects; it is also said that this means: they should have their left foot tied up such that they stand on three. (Then when their flanks fall (dead)) after immolating them, (eat thereof) of the meat of these sacrifices (and feed the beggar) who is content with little (and the supplicant) the one who faces you but does not beg of you.

(Thus have We made them subject unto ye that you may magnify Allah that He hath guided you) as He guided you to His religion and wont. (And give good tidings to the good) to those who are good in their words and deeds; and it is said that the good means: the generous with their sacrifices."

And through the believers He checks the disbelievers, and through the fighters He checks those who do not take part in fighting; if it had not been for this (cloisters) the cloisters of monks (and churches) of the Jews (and oratories) the Magians' houses of fire, because these were safe from Muslims (and mosques) of the Muslims, (wherein the name of Allah is oft mentioned) repeating the formulas: “Allah is the greatest” and “there is no deity except Allah”, (would assuredly have been pulled down.

ذٰلِكَ وَمَنْ عَاقَبَ بِمِثْلِ مَا عُوقِبَ بِهِ ثُمَّ بُغِيَ عَلَيْهِ لَيَنصُرَنَّهُ ٱللَّهُ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَعَفُوٌّ غَفُورٌ,"(That (is so)) that is Allah's judgement between the believers and disbelievers in the Hereafter. (And whoso hath retaliated) against the killer of his relative (with the like of that which he) his relative (was made to suffer and then hath (again) been wronged) and then he transgresses again against him, (Allah will succour him) i.e. Allah will help the wronged person against the transgressor, such that he kills him and no blood money will be taken from him. This is the case of a man whose relative is killed. And so he takes blood money from the killer of his relative. But then this man proceeds to kill the killer of his relative. This man must be killed and no blood money is accepted from him. (Lo! Allah verily is Mild) He pardons whoever repents, (Forgiving) He forgives whoever dies repentant."
ذٰلِكَ بِأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُولِجُ ٱللَّيْلَ فِي ٱلنَّهَارِ وَيُولِجُ ٱلنَّهَارَ فِي ٱللَّيْلِ وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ سَمِيعٌ بَصِيرٌ,"(That) the punishment of whoever transgresses against his brother (is because Allah maketh the night to pass into the day) He makes the night longer than the day (and maketh the day to pass into the night) and makes the day longer than the night, (and because Allah is Hearer) of what His created beings say, (Seer) of their works."
ذٰلِكَ بِأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ هُوَ ٱلْحَقُّ وَأَنَّ مَا يَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِهِ هُوَ ٱلْبَاطِلُ وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ هُوَ ٱلْعَلِيُّ ٱلْكَبِيرُ,"(That) the power that enables you to acknowledge and know (is because Allah, He is the True) is because the worship of Allah is the Truth, and that Allah is the Strong, (and that whereon they call) they worship (instead of Him) instead of Allah, (it is the false) it is flimsy, (and because Allah, He is the High) Higher than everything, (the Great) Greater than everything."
أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ أَنزَلَ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مَآءً فَتُصْبِحُ ٱلأَرْضُ مُخْضَرَّةً إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَطِيفٌ خَبِيرٌ,"(Seest thou not) have you not been informed, O Muhammad, in the Qur'an (how Allah sendeth down water) rain (from the sky and then the earth becometh green) with vegetation (upon the morrow? Lo! Allah is Subtile) in making plants grow, (Aware) of their place."
لَّهُ مَا فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَهُوَ ٱلْغَنِيُّ ٱلْحَمِيدُ,"(Unto Him belongeth all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth) of created beings. (Lo! Allah, He verily is the Absolute) He is free of need for His created beings, (the Owner of Praise) the One Who is praised in His actions; it is also said that this means: the Owner of Praise with regard to he who declares His divine Oneness."
أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ سَخَّرَ لَكُم مَّا فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَٱلْفُلْكَ تَجْرِي فِي ٱلْبَحْرِ بِأَمْرِهِ وَيُمْسِكُ ٱلسَّمَآءَ أَن تَقَعَ عَلَى ٱلأَرْضِ إِلاَّ بِإِذْنِهِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ بِٱلنَّاسِ لَرَءُوفٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"(Hast thou not seen) have you not, O Muhammad, been informed in the Qur'an (how Allah hath made all that is in the earth) of trees and beasts (subservient unto you?

(Lo! Allah is, for mankind) for the believers, (Full of Pity, Merciful)."
وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِيۤ أَحْيَاكُمْ ثُمَّ يُمِيتُكُمْ ثُمَّ يُحْيِيكُمْ إِنَّ ٱلإِنْسَانَ لَكَفُورٌ,"(And He it is Who gave you life) when you were very little in the wombs of your mothers, (then He will cause you to die) in young or old age, (and then will give you life (again)) at resurrection after death.

(Lo! thou indeed follow right guidance) you indeed follow an established religion with which Allah is pleased: the religion of Islam."
وَإِن جَادَلُوكَ فَقُلِ ٱللَّهُ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ,"(And if they wrangle with thee) concerning sacrifices and Allah's divine Oneness, because of their saying: "" that which Allah immolates is more lawful than what you immolate with your own knives "" , (say: Allah is best aware of what ye do) in the practice of your religion, whether it is a question of sacrifices or other things."
ٱللَّهُ يَحْكُمُ بَيْنَكُمْ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ فِيمَا كُنتُمْ فِيهِ تَخْتَلِفُونَ,(Allah will judge between you on the Day of Resurrection concerning that wherein ye used to differ) regarding sacrifices and Allah's divine Oneness.

Say) O Muhammad, to the people of Mecca: (Shall I proclaim unto you worse than that) worse than what you told the Muslims in the life of this world? They said to them: "" We have seen no adherents of any religion who are less fortunate than you "". And so Allah said: Say, O Muhammad… Allah said: what is worse is (The Fire! Allah hath promised it for the ones who disbelieve) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an; and you are indeed disbelievers in Muhammad and the Qur'an.

He means the people of Mecca. (A similitude is coined) He has explained the likeness of your deities, (so pay ye heed to it) and respond: (Lo! those on whom ye call beside Allah) of idols (will never create a fly) they will never be able to create a fly (though they) the worshipped and the worshippers (combine together for the purpose) they will not be able to create a fly. (And if the fly took something) like honey with which are sullied for example (from them) from the deities, (they could not rescue it from it) the deities would not be able to take it back from the fly. (So weak are (both) the seeker) i.e. the deity (and the sought) and the fly! It is also said that this means: so weak are both that which is worshipped and the worshipper."
مَا قَدَرُواْ ٱللَّهَ حَقَّ قَدْرِهِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَقَوِيٌّ عَزِيزٌ,"(They measure not Allah His rightful measure) they do not magnify Allah as He deserves to be magnified. This was revealed about the Jews when they claimed that 'Uzayr was the son of God, and due to their sayings: “Allah is poor while we are rich,”, “Allah's hands are tight because of miserliness” and that Allah rested after He finished creating the heavens and the earth. (Lo! Allah is Strong) against His enemies, (Almighty) He is Mighty in His vengeance against the Jews."

(He hath chosen you) for His religion (and hath not laid upon you in religion) in the matter of religion (any hardship) He says: whoever cannot pray standing, let him pray sitting; and whoever cannot pray sitting, let him pray lying down, just by making gestures; (the faith of your father Abraham) follow the religion of your father Abraham. (He hath named you) Allah named you (Muslims of old time) before this Qur'an, in the Scriptures of past prophets (and in this (Scripture)) i.e. the Qur'an, (that the messenger) Muhammad (pbuh) (may be a witness against you) against the disbelievers and in favour of the believers, (and that ye may be witnesses against mankind) in favour of the prophets. (So establish worship) perform the five daily prayers, by perfecting their ablutions, bowing, prostration and that which is prescribed in their appointed times, (pay the poor-due) from your wealth, (and hold fast to Allah) and hold fast to Allah's religion and Scripture. (He is your Protecting Friend. A blessed Patron) Protector (and a blessed Helper) Who will defend you!'"
قَدْ أَفْلَحَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ,"And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said regarding the meaning of Allah, Exalted is He, (Successful indeed are the believers): '(Successful indeed are the believers) He says: they are successful, safe and felicitous the ones who acknowledge Allah's divine Oneness. The latter are the ones who inherit Paradise, rather than the disbelievers; it is also said that this means: the believers will be safe due to their faith, and felicity is manifested in two ways: success and permanence."
ٱلَّذِينَ هُمْ فِي صَلاَتِهِمْ خَاشِعُونَ,"Then Allah mentioned the traits of the believers, saying: (Who are humble in their prayers) turning neither to the right nor to the left, nor raise their hands while praying,"
وَٱلَّذِينَ هُمْ عَنِ ٱللَّغْوِ مُّعْرِضُونَ,"(And who shun vain conversation) and refrain from falsehood and lying,"
وَٱلَّذِينَ هُمْ لِلزَّكَـاةِ فَاعِلُونَ,(And who are payers of the poor-due) and give the poor-due from their wealth;

وَقَالَ ٱلْمَلأُ مِن قَوْمِهِ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَكَذَّبُواْ بِلِقَآءِ ٱلآخِرَةِ وَأَتْرَفْنَاهُمْ فِي ٱلْحَيـاةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا مَا هَـٰذَا إِلاَّ بَشَرٌ مِّثْلُكُمْ يَأْكُلُ مِمَّا تَأْكُلُونَ مِنْهُ وَيَشْرَبُ مِمَّا تَشْرَبُونَ,"(And the chieftains of his folk) of the folk of the messenger, (who disbelieved and denied the meeting of the Hereafter) and disbelieved in resurrection after death, (and whom We had made soft) whom We blessed with wealth and offspring (in the life of the world, said: This) i.e. this Messenger (is only a mortal) a human being (like you, who eateth of that whereof you eat) who eats as you eat (and drinketh of that ye drink) and drinks as you do."
وَلَئِنْ أَطَعْتُمْ بَشَراً مِّثْلَكُمْ إِنَّكُمْ إِذاً لَّخَاسِرُونَ,"(If ye were to obey a mortal) a human being (like yourselves, ye surely would be losers) you would be ignorant and losers."
أَيَعِدُكُمْ أَنَّكُمْ إِذَا مِتُّمْ وَكُنتُمْ تُرَاباً وَعِظاماً أَنَّكُمْ مُّخْرَجُونَ,"(Doth he) does this Messenger (promise you that you, when ye are dead and have become dust) after death (and bones) and decayed bones, (will (again) be brought forth) will be brought back to life after death?"
هَيْهَاتَ هَيْهَاتَ لِمَا تُوعَدُونَ,"(Be gone, be gone, with that which ye are promised!) how farfetched, how farfetched! This will never be."
إِنْ هِيَ إِلاَّ حَيَاتُنَا ٱلدُّنْيَا نَمُوتُ وَنَحْيَا وَمَا نَحْنُ بِمَبْعُوثِينَ,"(There is naught but our life of the world; we die and we live) the fathers die and their children live, (and we shall not be raised (again)) after we die."
إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ رَجُلٌ ٱفتَرَىٰ عَلَىٰ ٱللَّهِ كَذِباً وَمَا نَحْنُ لَهُ بِمُؤْمِنِينَ,(He is only a man) they mean the Messenger is only a man (who hath invented a lie about Allah) in that which he says. (We are not going to put faith in him) we are not going to believe what he says.
قَالَ رَبِّ ٱنْصُرْنِي بِمَا كَذَّبُونِ,"(He said) the Messenger said: (My Lord! Help me) by sending punishment on them (because they deny me) because they disbelieve in my message,"
قَالَ عَمَّا قَلِيلٍ لَّيُصْبِحُنَّ نَادِمِينَ,(He said) Allah said: (In a little while they surely will become repentant) they will regret their disbelief when the chastisement seizes them.
فَأَخَذَتْهُمُ ٱلصَّيْحَةُ بِٱلْحَقِّ فَجَعَلْنَاهُمْ غُثَآءً فَبُعْداً لِّلْقَوْمِ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ,"(So the (Awful) Cry overtook them rightfully) i.e. the punishment, which is the cry of Gabriel, seized them, (and We made them) when the chastisement stopped (like a wreckage (that a torrent hurls). A far removal) an utter destruction and disappointment for failing to obtain Allah's mercy (for wrong-doing folk!) for the disbelievers."
ثُمَّ أَنشَأْنَا مِن بَعْدِهِمْ قُرُوناً آخَرِينَ,(Then after them) then after their destruction (We brought forth other generations) from generation to generation.
مَا تَسْبِقُ مِنْ أُمَّةٍ أَجَلَهَا وَمَا يَسْتَأْخِرُونَ,"(No nation can outstrip its term) no nation can bring forward the term appointed for its destruction, (nor yet postpone it) to a later date."
ثُمَّ أَرْسَلْنَا رُسُلَنَا تَتْرَا كُلَّ مَا جَآءَ أُمَّةً رَّسُولُهَا كَذَّبُوهُ فَأَتْبَعْنَا بَعْضَهُمْ بَعْضاً وَجَعَلْنَاهُمْ أَحَادِيثَ فَبُعْداً لِّقَوْمٍ لاَّ يُؤْمِنُونَ,(Then We sent our messengers one after another. Whenever its messenger came unto a nation they denied him) they denied that messenger; (so We caused them to follow one another (to disaster)) with chastisement (and We made them bywords) We made them the talk of their time. (A far removal) what a disappointment for failing to obtain Allah's mercy (for folk who believe not!) for people who disbelieve in Muhammad (pbuh).
ثُمَّ أَرْسَلْنَا مُوسَىٰ وَأَخَاهُ هَارُونَ بِآيَاتِنَا وَسُلْطَانٍ مُّبِينٍ,(Then We sent Moses and his brother Aaron with Our) nine (tokens and a clear warrant) and a clear proof.
إِلَىٰ فِرْعَوْنَ وَمَلَئِهِ فَٱسْتَكْبَرُواْ وَكَانُواْ قَوْماً عَالِينَ,"(Unto Pharaoh and his chiefs, but they scorned (them)) they were too proud to believe in Moses and the signs (and they were despotic folk) they opposed Moses and felt too proud to believe."

فَكَذَّبُوهُمَا فَكَانُواْ مِنَ ٱلْمُهْلَكِينَ,"(So they denied them) they denied their message, (and became of those who were destroyed) they were drowned in the sea."
وَلَقَدْ آتَيْنَا مُوسَىٰ ٱلْكِتَابَ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَهْتَدُونَ,"(And we verily gave Moses the Scripture) the Torah, (that haply they might go aright) that haply they might be led to guidance."

يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلرُّسُلُ كُلُواْ مِنَ ٱلطَّيِّبَاتِ وَٱعْمَلُواْ صَالِحاً إِنِّي بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ عَلِيمٌ,"(O ye messengers!) the reference here is to Muhammad (Eat of the good thing) eat of the lawful things, (and do right) do righteous works between yourself and your Lord. (Lo! I am Aware) I am aware of the reward (of what ye do) of what you do, O Muhammad, and also of what they do."

فَتَقَطَّعُوۤاْ أَمْرَهُمْ بَيْنَهُمْ زُبُراً كُلُّ حِزْبٍ بِمَا لَدَيْهِمْ فَرِحُونَ,"(But they (mankind) have broken their religion among them into sects) so they split among themselves with regard to religion into different groups: groups of Jews, Christians, idolaters and Magians, (each sect) the adherents of each religion and sect (rejoicing in its tenets) being impressed with what they have."
فَذَرْهُمْ فِي غَمْرَتِهِمْ حَتَّىٰ حِينٍ,(So leave them) O Muhammad (in their error) in their ignorance (till a time) until the advent of punishment on the Day of Badr.
أَيَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّمَا نُمِدُّهُمْ بِهِ مِن مَّالٍ وَبَنِينَ,"(Think they) do the adherents of these sects think (that in the wealth and sons wherewith We provide them) in the life of this world,"

إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ هُم مِّنْ خَشْيةِ رَبِّهِمْ مُّشْفِقُونَ,"Then Allah clarified to whom He hastens with good things in the life of this world, saying: (Lo! those who go in awe for fear of their Lord) of their Lord's chastisement; for these We hasten with good things;"
وَٱلَّذِينَ هُم بِآيَاتِ رَبَّهِمْ يُؤْمِنُونَ,"(And those who believe in the revelations of their Lord) in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an, for these We hasten with good things;"

Nay, but he bringeth them the Truth) Muhammad (pbuh) brought them the Qur'an, the profession of Allah's divine Oneness and the Message; (and most of them are haters) deniers (of the Truth) of the Qur'an."
وَلَوِ ٱتَّبَعَ ٱلْحَقُّ أَهْوَآءَهُمْ لَفَسَدَتِ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتُ وَٱلأَرْضُ وَمَن فِيهِنَّ بَلْ أَتَيْنَاهُمْ بِذِكْرِهِمْ فَهُمْ عَن ذِكْرِهِمْ مُّعْرِضُونَ,"(And if the Truth had followed their desires) if it was according to their whims such that there is a deity in the heavens and a deity in the earth, (verily the heavens and the earth and whosoever is therein) of created beings (had been corrupted.

وَإِنَّكَ لَتَدْعُوهُمْ إِلَىٰ صِرَاطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ,(And lo! thou) O Muhammad (summonest them indeed unto a right path) to an established religion which Allah is pleased with: Islam.

وَلَوْ رَحِمْنَاهُمْ وَكَشَفْنَا مَا بِهِمْ مِّن ضُرٍّ لَّلَجُّواْ فِي طُغْيَانِهِمْ يَعْمَهُونَ,"(Though We had mercy on them) i.e. the people of Mecca (and relieved them of the harm) and relieved them of the hunger which was (afflicting them, they still would wander blindly on) they still would carry on blind to the Truth and guidance (in their contumacy) in their disbelief and error."
وَلَقَدْ أَخَذْنَاهُمْ بِٱلْعَذَابِ فَمَا ٱسْتَكَانُواْ لِرَبِّهِمْ وَمَا يَتَضَرَّعُونَ,"(Already have We grasped them with punishment) with hunger and drought, (but they humble not themselves unto their Lord) but they did not submit themselves to their Lord by professing Allah's divine Oneness, (nor do they pray) nor do they believe,"

(Have ye then no sense) do you then not believe in resurrection after death?"
بَلْ قَالُواْ مِثْلَ مَا قَالَ ٱلأَوَّلُونَ,"(Nay, but they) i.e. the people of Mecca (say the like of that which) disbelieve in resurrection after death in the same was as (said the men of old) the people of old disbelieved in resurrection after death;"

قَالُواْ رَبَّنَا غَلَبَتْ عَلَيْنَا شِقْوَتُنَا وَكُنَّا قَوْماً ضَآلِّينَ,"(They will say) the disbelievers will say upon entering hell: (Our Lord!) O our Lord! (Our evil fortune) which was decreed upon us in the Guarded Tablet (conquered us) this is why we did not believe, (and we were erring folk) and we were disbelievers."
رَبَّنَآ أَخْرِجْنَا مِنْهَا فَإِنْ عُدْنَا فَإِنَّا ظَالِمُونَ,"(Our Lord!) O our Lord! (Oh, bring us forth from hence) take us out of hell! (If we return) to disbelief (then indeed we shall be wrong-doers) then we will be transgressing against ourselves."
قَالَ ٱخْسَئُواْ فِيهَا وَلاَ تُكَلِّمُونِ,"(He saith) Allah says to them: (Be gone therein) be abased in hell, (and speak not unto Me) and do not ask Me to get you out of hell."
إِنَّهُ كَانَ فَرِيقٌ مِّنْ عِبَادِي يَقُولُونَ رَبَّنَآ آمَنَّا فَٱغْفِرْ لَنَا وَٱرْحَمْنَا وَأَنتَ خَيْرُ ٱلرَّاحِمِينَ,"(Lo! there was a party of My) believing (slaves who said: Our Lord!) O our Lord! (We believe) in You, in Your Messenger and in Your Book, (therefore forgive us) our sins (and have mercy on us) by not punishing us (for Thou art Best of all who show mercy) You are more merciful towards us than our own parents;"
فَٱتَّخَذْتُمُوهُمْ سِخْرِيّاً حَتَّىٰ أَنسَوْكُمْ ذِكْرِي وَكُنْتُمْ مِّنْهُمْ تَضْحَكُونَ,"(But ye chose them from a laughing stock until they caused you to forget remembrance of Me) until they preoccupied you from declaring My divine Oneness and worshipping Me, (while ye laughed at them) and mocked them."
إِنِّي جَزَيْتُهُمُ ٱلْيَوْمَ بِمَا صَبَرُوۤاْ أَنَّهُمْ هُمُ ٱلْفَآئِزُونَ,(Lo! I have rewarded them this day) with Paradise (forasmuch as they were steadfast) in obeying me and withholding your harm; (and they verily are the triumphant) they have gained Paradise and become safe from hell. This verse was revealed about Abu Jahl and his host who mocked Salman [al-Farisi] and his fellow-believers
قَالَ كَمْ لَبِثْتُمْ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ عَدَدَ سِنِينَ,"(He will say) Allah will say to them: (How long tarried you) how long have you remained (in the earth) in your graves, (counting by years) how many days and months?"
قَالُواْ لَبِثْنَا يَوْماً أَوْ بَعْضَ يَوْمٍ فَسْئَلِ ٱلْعَآدِّينَ,"(They will say: We tarried but a day) upon saying this, they will have some doubt, and therefore will say: (or part of a day). Then, they said: we do not know: (Ask of those who keep count!) i.e. the angels who record people's deeds; it is also said that this refers to the angel of death and his helpers."
قَالَ إِن لَّبِثْتُمْ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً لَّوْ أَنَّكُمْ كُنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ,"(He will say) Allah will say to them: (Ye tarried) you remained in your graves (but a little) in comparison to your dwelling in hell (if ye only knew) this; He says: if you only believe what I say; it is also said that this means: if only you did believe in My prophets in the life of the world, you would know now that you remained in your graves but a short time."
أَفَحَسِبْتُمْ أَنَّمَا خَلَقْنَاكُمْ عَبَثاً وَأَنَّكُمْ إِلَيْنَا لاَ تُرْجَعُونَ,"(Deemed ye then) O people of Mecca (that We had created you for naught) in vain, without commands and prohibitions, reward and punishment, (and that ye would not be returned unto Us) after you die?"
فَتَعَالَى ٱللَّهُ ٱلْمَلِكُ ٱلْحَقُّ لاَ إِلَـٰهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ رَبُّ ٱلْعَرْشِ ٱلْكَرِيمِ,"(Now Allah be exalted) Allah is exonerated from and far above having a son or partner, (the True King! There is no God save Him, the Lord of the Throne of Grace."
وَمَن يَدْعُ مَعَ ٱللَّهِ إِلَـهَا آخَرَ لاَ بُرْهَانَ لَهُ بِهِ فَإِنَّمَا حِسَابُهُ عِندَ رَبِّهِ إِنَّهُ لاَ يُفْلِحُ ٱلْكَافِرُونَ,He who crieth unto) worships (any other god) among idols (along with Allah hath no proof thereof) no proof for worshipping other than Allah. (His reckoning) his chastisement (is only with his Lord) in the Hereafter. (Lo! disbelievers will not be successful) disbelievers will not be safe from Allah's chastisement nor escape from it.
وَقُل رَّبِّ ٱغْفِرْ وَٱرْحَمْ وَأنتَ خَيْرُ ٱلرَّاحِمِينَ,"(And say) O Muhammad: (My Lord! Forgive) my nation (and have mercy) on my nation by not punishing them, (for Thou art Best of all who show mercy) the most Merciful of all who show mercy'."
سُورَةٌ أَنزَلْنَاهَا وَفَرَضْنَاهَا وَأَنزَلْنَا فِيهَآ آيَاتٍ بَيِّنَاتٍ لَّعَلَّكُمْ تَذَكَّرُونَ,"And from his own narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said regarding the interpretation of Allah's saying ((Here is) a surah which We have revealed): '((Here is) a surah which We have revealed) He says: We sent Gabriel with it (and enjoined) We exposited in it the lawful and the unlawful, (and wherein We have revealed plain tokens) containing commands and prohibitions, obligations and legal punishments, (that haply ye may take heed) that you may take admonition in the commands and prohibitions, so do not suspend the application of legal punishments."
ٱلزَّانِيَةُ وَٱلزَّانِي فَٱجْلِدُواْ كُلَّ وَاحِدٍ مِّنْهُمَا مِئَةَ جَلْدَةٍ وَلاَ تَأْخُذْكُمْ بِهِمَا رَأْفَةٌ فِي دِينِ ٱللَّهِ إِن كُنتُمْ تُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلآخِرِ وَلْيَشْهَدْ عَذَابَهُمَا طَآئِفَةٌ مِّنَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,"(The adulterer and the adulteress) who are unmarried and have not been married before, (scourge ye each one of them (with) a hundred stripes) flog each one of them a hundred times. (And let not pity for the twain) for applying the legal punishment (withhold you from obedience to Allah) withhold you from executing Allah's legal ruling on them, (if ye believe in Allah and the Last Day) in resurrection after death. (And let a party of believers) one man, two or more so that the punishment is preserved (witness their punishment) witness the execution of the punishment."
ٱلزَّانِي لاَ يَنكِحُ إِلاَّ زَانِيَةً أَوْ مُشْرِكَةً وَٱلزَّانِيَةُ لاَ يَنكِحُهَآ إِلاَّ زَانٍ أَوْ مُشْرِكٌ وَحُرِّمَ ذٰلِكَ عَلَى ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,"(The adulterer) from the people of the Book who admits his crime (shall not marry save an adulteress) from the slaves of the people of the Book (or an idolatress) from the slaves of the Arab idolaters, (and the adulteress none shall marry save an adulterer) from the people of the Book (or an idolater) from the Arab idolaters. (All that) marrying the slaves of the people of the Book and the slaves of Arab idolaters (is forbidden unto believers) this verse was revealed about a group among the Companions of the Prophet (pbuh) who wanted to marry some slaves from the people of the Book and Arab idolaters in Medina. These slaves were known adulteresses but these prophetic Companions wanted to marry them in order to win them over. When this verse was revealed they refrained from marrying them."
وَٱلَّذِينَ يَرْمُونَ ٱلْمُحْصَنَاتِ ثُمَّ لَمْ يَأْتُواْ بِأَرْبَعَةِ شُهَدَآءَ فَٱجْلِدُوهُمْ ثَمَانِينَ جَلْدَةً وَلاَ تَقْبَلُواْ لَهُمْ شَهَادَةً أَبَداً وَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْفَاسِقُونَ,"(And those who accuse honourable women) of committing adultery (but bring not four witnesses) four upright, Muslim persons, (scourge them (with)) flog them (eighty stripes) for their slander (and never (afterward) accept their testimony. They indeed are evil-doers) they are sinners because of their slander."
إِلاَّ ٱلَّذِينَ تَابُواْ مِن بَعْدِ ذٰلِكَ وَأَصْلَحُواْ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"(Save those who afterward repent) after their slander (and make amends) between themselves and their Lord. ((For such) lo! Allah is Forgiving) He forgives whoever repents, (Merciful) He bestows mercy upon whoever dies repentant. This verse was revealed about 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy and his host."
وَٱلَّذِينَ يَرْمُونَ أَزْوَاجَهُمْ وَلَمْ يَكُنْ لَّهُمْ شُهَدَآءُ إِلاَّ أَنفُسُهُمْ فَشَهَادَةُ أَحَدِهِمْ أَرْبَعُ شَهَادَاتٍ بِٱللَّهِ إِنَّهُ لَمِنَ ٱلصَّادِقِينَ,"(As for those who accuse their wives) of committing adultery (but have no witnesses) for their accusation (except themselves; let the testimony of one of them be four testimonies, (swearing) by Allah) other than Whom there is no god (that he is of those who speak the Truth) about his accusation of his wife;"

This verse was revealed about 'Asim Ibn 'Adiyy al-Ansari who was afflicted with this."
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ جَآءُوا بِٱلإِفْكِ عُصْبَةٌ مِّنْكُمْ لاَ تَحْسَبُوهُ شَرّاً لَّكُمْ بَلْ هُوَ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ لِكُلِّ ٱمْرِىءٍ مِّنْهُمْ مَّا ٱكْتَسَبَ مِنَ ٱلإِثْمِ وَٱلَّذِي تَوَلَّىٰ كِبْرَهُ مِنْهُمْ لَهُ عَذَابٌ عَظِيمٌ,"(Lo! they who spread the slander) those who spread the lie (are a gang among you) this was revealed about 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy Ibn Salul, the hypocrite, and Hassan Ibn Thabit al-Ansari, and Mistah Ibn Uthathah, the cousin of Abu Bakr al-Siddiq, and 'Ubadah Ibn 'Abd al-Muttalib and Hamnah Bint Jahsh al-Asadiyyah who slandered 'A'ishah and Safwan Ibn al-Mu'attal. (Deem it not) deem not the slandering of 'A'ishah and Safwan (a bad thing for you) in the Hereafter; (say, it is good for you) in terms of reward. (Unto every man of them) who engaged in slandering 'A'ishah and Safwan Ibn al-Mu'attal (will be paid that which he hath earned of the sin) in accordance to his engagement in the slander; (and as for him among them who had the greater share therein) the one who spread the matter and uttered abominable things concerning this matter, i.e. 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy (his will be an awful doom) in this worldly life by imposing the legal punishment on him and in the Hereafter by being cast in hell."
لَّوْلاۤ إِذْ سَمِعْتُمُوهُ ظَنَّ ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ وَٱلْمُؤْمِنَاتُ بِأَنْفُسِهِمْ خَيْراً وَقَالُواْ هَـٰذَآ إِفْكٌ مُّبِينٌ,"(Why did not the believers, men and women, when you heard it) i.e. the slander of 'A'ishah and Safwan, (think good of their own folk) think good of 'A'ishah as they would think good of their mothers; (and say: It) their slander (is a manifest untruth) is a manifest lie?"
لَّوْلاَ جَآءُوا عَلَيْهِ بِأَرْبَعَةِ شُهَدَآءَ فَإِذْ لَمْ يَأْتُواْ بِالشُّهَدَآءِ فَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ هُمُ ٱلْكَاذِبُونَ,"(Why did they not produce four witnesses) four, upright witnesses to support their claim? (Since they produce not witnesses) four witnesses, (they verily are liars in the sight of Allah)."
وَلَوْلاَ فَضْلُ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ وَرَحْمَتُهُ فِي ٱلدُّنْيَا وَٱلآخِرَةِ لَمَسَّكُمْ فِي مَآ أَفَضْتُمْ فِيهِ عَذَابٌ عَظِيمٌ,Then Allah revealed the following about those who did not slander 'A'ishah but talked about the slander: (Had it not been for the grace of Allah and His mercy unto you in the world and the Hereafter an awful doom had overtaken you) chastisement would have seized you in this worldly life and in the Hereafter (for that whereof you murmured) for the slanderous accusation which you repeated.
إِذْ تَلَقَّوْنَهُ بِأَلْسِنَتِكُمْ وَتَقُولُونَ بِأَفْوَاهِكُمْ مَّا لَّيْسَ لَكُمْ بِهِ عِلْمٌ وَتَحْسَبُونَهُ هَيِّناً وَهُوَ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ عَظِيمٌ,"(When ye welcomed it with your tongues) when you related the slander to each other, (and uttered with your mouths that whereof ye had no knowledge) proof or clarification, (ye counted it) i.e. the slander of 'A'ishah (a trifle) an insignificant sin. (In the sight of Allah it is very great) in terms of punishment."
وَلَوْلاۤ إِذْ سَمِعْتُمُوهُ قُلْتُمْ مَّا يَكُونُ لَنَآ أَن نَّتَكَلَّمَ بِهَـٰذَا سُبْحَانَكَ هَـٰذَا بُهْتَانٌ عَظِيمٌ,"(Wherefore, when ye heard it) i.e. the slander of 'A'ishah and Safwan, (said ye not: It is not for us to speak of this) we are not permitted to speak about this lie. (Glory be to Thee (O Allah); This is awful calumny) this is a great lie."
يَعِظُكُمُ ٱللَّهُ أَن تَعُودُواْ لِمِثْلِهِ أَبَداً إِن كُنتُمْ مُّؤْمِنِينَ,"(Allah admonisheth you) Allah warns and prohibits you (that ye repeat not the like thereof ever) to ever engage in similar things, (if ye are (in truth) believers) if you are true believers."
وَيُبَيِّنُ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمُ ٱلآيَاتِ وَٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ حَكِيمٌ,"(And He expoundeth unto you His revelations) detailing the commands and prohibitions. (Allah is Knower) He knows what you say, (Wise) regarding the legal punishments He imposes on you."
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يُحِبُّونَ أَن تَشِيعَ ٱلْفَاحِشَةُ فِي ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ فِي ٱلدُّنْيَا وَٱلآخِرَةِ وَٱللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ وَأَنْتُمْ لاَ تَعْلَمُونَ,"(Lo! Those) i.e. 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy and his host (who love that slander should be spread) appear (concerning those who believe) 'A'ishah and Safwan, (theirs will be a painful punishment) by being flogged (in the world and the Hereafter) by being thrown in hell, especially 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy. (Allah knoweth) that 'A'ishah and Safwan did not commit adultery. (Ye know not) this."
وَلَوْلاَ فَضْلُ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ وَرَحْمَتُهُ وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ رَءُوفٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"(Had it not been for the grace of Allah and His mercy unto you) unto those who did not slander 'A'ishah and Safwan, (and that Allah is Clement, Merciful, (ye had been undone)) towards the believers."
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ لاَ تَتَّبِعُواْ خُطُوَاتِ ٱلشَّيْطَانِ وَمَن يَتَّبِعْ خُطُوَاتِ ٱلشَّيْطَانِ فَإِنَّهُ يَأْمُرُ بِٱلْفَحْشَآءِ وَٱلْمُنْكَرِ وَلَوْلاَ فَضْلُ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ وَرَحْمَتُهُ مَا زَكَىٰ مِنكُمْ مِّنْ أَحَدٍ أَبَداً وَلَـٰكِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُزَكِّي مَن يَشَآءُ وَٱللَّهُ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ,"Allah then warned the believers from following Satan, saying: (O ye who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an! (Follow not the footsteps of the devil) do not follow Satan's embellishment and whisperings. (Unto whomsoever followeth the footsteps of the devil) whoever follows Satan's embellishment and whisperings, (lo! he commandeth filthiness) evil words and deeds (and wrong) that which is not in the Shari'ah or the Sunnah. (Had it not been for the grace of Allah and His mercy unto you) through preserving you from sins and giving you success, (not one of you would ever have grown pure) no one of you would profess Allah's divine Oneness or become righteous. (But Allah causeth whom He will to grow) but Allah gives success and makes righteous whoever deserves it. (And Allah is Hearer) He hears what you say, (Knower) He knows you and your works."
وَلاَ يَأْتَلِ أُوْلُواْ ٱلْفَضْلِ مِنكُمْ وَٱلسَّعَةِ أَن يُؤْتُوۤاْ أُوْلِي ٱلْقُرْبَىٰ وَٱلْمَسَاكِينَ وَٱلْمُهَاجِرِينَ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ وَلْيَعْفُواْ وَلْيَصْفَحُوۤاْ أَلاَ تُحِبُّونَ أَن يَغْفِرَ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"Allah then revealed the following about Abu Bakr when he swore that he will not spend on his relatives, Mistah and others, because they talked about the slandering of 'A'ishah: (And let not those who possess dignity) through their spending (and ease) due to their wealth (among you swear not to give to the near of kin) Mistah was his maternal cousin (and to the needy) beside being his cousin, Mistah was also poor, (and to fugitives for the cause of Allah) and to the Immigrants for the sake of Allah, for Mistah was also an Immigrant. (Let them forgive and show indulgence. Yearn ye not that Allah may forgive you) do you not want, O Abu Bakr, that Allah forgive you? (Allah is Forgiving, Merciful) towards the person who repents. When he heard this, Abu Bakr said: "" I do indeed, O my Lord! "" and so after the revelation of this verse, he showed kindness to his relatives and helped them financially."
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يَرْمُونَ ٱلْمُحْصَنَاتِ ٱلْغَافِلاَتِ ٱلْمُؤْمِناتِ لُعِنُواْ فِي ٱلدُّنْيَا وَٱلآخِرَةِ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ عَظِيمٌ,"Allah then revealed the following about 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy and his host who slandered 'A'ishah and Safwan: (Lo! as for those who traduce) accusing them of adultery (virtuous) and free, (believing) they believe in Allah's divine Oneness (women) i.e. 'A'ishah ((who are) careless) who are chaste and exonerated from adultery, (cursed are they) they should be punished (in the world) by flogging them (and the Hereafter) by casting them in the Fire. The reference here is to 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy. (Theirs) the reference here is to 'Abdullah ibn Ubayy and his host (will be an awful doom) more severe than the chastisement they will be exposed to in this worldly life."
يَوْمَ تَشْهَدُ عَلَيْهِمْ أَلْسِنَتُهُمْ وَأَيْدِيهِمْ وَأَرْجُلُهُمْ بِمَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ,"(On the day) which is the Day of Judgement (when their tongues and their hands and their feet testify against them) against what 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy and his host said and did (as to what they used to do) in the life of this world,"

(Good women) good women in their speech and deeds (are for good men) they deserve them, (and good men for good women) they deserve one another; it is also said that this means: good women, i.e. 'A'ishah, are for good men, i.e. the Prophet (pbuh); (such) 'A'ishah and Safwan (are innocent of that which people say) they are innocent of people's slander: (For them is pardon) their sins are pardoned in the life of this world (and a bountiful provision) in Paradise. He says: when any man or woman are praised, and they deserve such a praise, then whatever they are praised with is true. And when a vile man or woman are mentioned with ill, and they deserve such an ill mention, then they deserve being mentioned in an ill manner."
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ لاَ تَدْخُلُواْ بُيُوتاً غَيْرَ بُيُوتِكُمْ حَتَّىٰ تَسْتَأْنِسُواْ وَتُسَلِّمُواْ عَلَىٰ أَهْلِهَا ذٰلِكُمْ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَذَكَّرُونَ,"Allah then prohibited them from entering in on one another without first asking permission, saying: (O ye who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an! (Enter not houses other than your own) you are not permitted to enter houses (without first announcing your presence and invoking peace upon the folk thereof. That) announcing your presence and invoking peace (is better for you) and more akin to righteousness, (that ye may be heedful) that you may take admonition and not enter in on each other without permission."
فَإِن لَّمْ تَجِدُواْ فِيهَآ أَحَداً فَلاَ تَدْخُلُوهَا حَتَّىٰ يُؤْذَنَ لَكُمْ وَإِن قِيلَ لَكُمْ ٱرْجِعُواْ فَٱرْجِعُواْ هُوَ أَزْكَىٰ لَكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ عَلِيمٌ,"(And if ye find no one therein) in the houses to give you permission to enter, (still enter not until permission hath been given) to enter. (And if it be said unto you: Go away again) and if you are told not to enter, (then go away) and remain not standing at the door of people's houses, (for it is purer for you) for it is better for you than to remain standing at the doors of people's houses. (Allah knoweth what ye do) of asking permission and other things."
لَّيْسَ عَلَيْكُمْ جُنَاحٌ أَن تَدْخُلُواْ بُيُوتاً غَيْرَ مَسْكُونَةٍ فِيهَا مَتَاعٌ لَّكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ مَا تُبْدُونَ وَمَا تَكْتُمُونَ,"Then Allah gave them leave to enter houses which are not theirs-it is here a question of the inns which are usually found in the roads-saying: ((It is) no sin) there is no constraint (for you to enter uninhabited houses) houses which do not have known inhabitants, such as inns and hostels (wherein is comfort for you) where you can find some benefit, against cold in the winter and heat in the summer (Allah knoweth what ye proclaim) of asking permission and invoking greetings of peace (and what ye hide) of giving a response and permission."
قُلْ لِّلْمُؤْمِنِينَ يَغُضُّواْ مِنْ أَبْصَارِهِمْ وَيَحْفَظُواْ فُرُوجَهُمْ ذٰلِكَ أَزْكَىٰ لَهُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ خَبِيرٌ بِمَا يَصْنَعُونَ,"Allah then commanded them to protect their gaze and chastity, saying: (Tell the believing men) O Muhammad (to lower their gaze) from that which is unlawful (and be modest) and also refrain from unlawful sexual intercourse. (That) protecting their gaze and chastity (is purer for them) is better and more akin to righteousness as far as they are concerned. (Lo! Allah is Aware of what they do) of good and evil."
وَقُل لِّلْمُؤْمِنَاتِ يَغْضُضْنَ مِنْ أَبْصَارِهِنَّ وَيَحْفَظْنَ فُرُوجَهُنَّ وَلاَ يُبْدِينَ زِينَتَهُنَّ إِلاَّ مَا ظَهَرَ مِنْهَا وَلْيَضْرِبْنَ بِخُمُرِهِنَّ عَلَىٰ جُيُوبِهِنَّ وَلاَ يُبْدِينَ زِينَتَهُنَّ إِلاَّ لِبُعُولَتِهِنَّ أَوْ آبَآئِهِنَّ أَوْ آبَآءِ بُعُولَتِهِنَّ أَوْ أَبْنَآئِهِنَّ أَوْ أَبْنَآءِ بُعُولَتِهِنَّ أَوْ إِخْوَانِهِنَّ أَوْ بَنِيۤ إِخْوَانِهِنَّ أَوْ بَنِي أَخَوَاتِهِنَّ أَوْ نِسَآئِهِنَّ أَوْ مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُهُنَّ أَوِ ٱلتَّابِعِينَ غَيْرِ أُوْلِي ٱلإِرْبَةِ مِنَ ٱلرِّجَالِ أَوِ ٱلطِّفْلِ ٱلَّذِينَ لَمْ يَظْهَرُواْ عَلَىٰ عَوْرَاتِ ٱلنِّسَآءِ وَلاَ يَضْرِبْنَ بِأَرْجُلِهِنَّ لِيُعْلَمَ مَا يُخْفِينَ مِن زِينَتِهِنَّ وَتُوبُوۤاْ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ جَمِيعاً أَيُّهَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ,"(And tell the believing women) O Muhammad (to lower their gaze) from men, that which is unlawful as far as men are concerned (and be modest) and be chaste, (and to display of their adornment) their bracelets and ornamented belts (only that which is apparent) of their clothes, (and to draw their veils over their bosoms) and they should tie that; and then Allah mentioned the adornment again, and said: (and not to reveal their adornment) their bracelets and ornamented belts and other things (save to their own husbands or fathers) blood fathers or stepfathers (or husbands fathers, or their sons) real sons or milk sons (or their husbands' sons) from other women, (or their brothers) their milk brothers or blood brothers (or their brothers' sons) their real sons or stepsons (or sisters sons) their real sons or milk sons, (or their women) i.e. Muslim women who belong to their own religion, because it is unlawful for Jewish, Christian or Magian women to see them without their clothes on, (or their slaves) female slaves, not male slaves, (or male attendants who lack vigour) or male attendants who belong to their husbands who have no desire for women: i.e. eunuchs and elderly men, (or children who know naught of women's nakedness) children who are too young to sleep with women and do not understand what goes on between men and women, such as these can see the adornment of women without there being any doubt. (And let them not stamp their feet) their anklets (so as to reveal what they hide of their adornment) so that strange men know what they hide of their adornment. (And turn unto Allah together) and repent of all sins whether great or small, (O believers, in order that ye may succeed) in order that you escape Allah's wrath and chastisement."
وَأَنْكِحُواْ ٱلأَيَامَىٰ مِنْكُمْ وَٱلصَّالِحِينَ مِنْ عِبَادِكُمْ وَإِمائِكُمْ إِن يَكُونُواْ فُقَرَآءَ يُغْنِهِمُ ٱللَّهُ مِن فَضْلِهِ وَٱللَّهُ وَاسِعٌ عَلِيمٌ,"Then Allah guided them to marry their boys and girls, brothers and sisters, who do not have spouses, saying: (And marry such of you as are solitary) your daughters and sisters; and it is said that this means: your children and brothers and sisters who are still unmarried (and the pious of your slaves and maid servants) and also get your pious slave men and women married. (If they) i.e. those who are free (be poor; Allah will enrich them of His bounty) of His provision. (Allah is of ample means) He provides for both those who are free as well as for the slaves, (Aware) and He is Aware of the provision of all of them."
وَلْيَسْتَعْفِفِ ٱلَّذِينَ لاَ يَجِدُونَ نِكَاحاً حَتَّىٰ يُغْنِيَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ مِن فَضْلِهِ وَٱلَّذِينَ يَبْتَغُونَ الْكِتَابَ مِمَّا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُكُمْ فَكَاتِبُوهُمْ إِنْ عَلِمْتُمْ فِيهِمْ خَيْراً وَآتُوهُمْ مِّن مَّالِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلَّذِيۤ آتَاكُمْ وَلاَ تُكْرِهُواْ فَتَيَاتِكُمْ عَلَى ٱلْبِغَآءِ إِنْ أَرَدْنَ تَحَصُّناً لِّتَبْتَغُواْ عَرَضَ ٱلْحَيَاةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَمَن يُكْرِههُنَّ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ مِن بَعْدِ إِكْرَاهِهِنَّ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"(And let those who cannot find a match) those who are unable to marry (keep chaste till Allah give them independence by His grace) until Allah gives them sufficiency from His provision. This was revealed about Huwaytib Ibn 'Abd al-'Uzza who refused to agree to give one of his slaves a chance to buy out his freedom. (And such of your slaves as seek a writing (of emancipation)) to buy out their freedom, (write it for them if ye are aware of aught of good in them) if you know they are righteous and keep their promise, (and bestow upon them) upon all people (of the wealth of Allah which He hath bestowed upon you) so that they can make an agreement for their emancipation; it is also said that here the master is encouraged to forgive a third of what has been agreed upon with his slave who wants to buy out his freedom. Then the following was revealed about 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy and his host because they used to force their female slaves to commit adultery in order to earn money from them and have more slaves as result of the children they bore as a consequence, and so Allah forbade them from doing this and made such an act forbidden: (Force not your slave girls to whoredom that ye may seek enjoyment of the life of the world) from what they earn from working as prostitutes and also from the children they give birth to, (if they would preserve their chastity) if they want to remain chaste. (And if one force them) and if one force these slave girl to commit adultery, (then (unto them), after their compulsion) and repentance, (Lo! Allah will be Forgiving) He forgives them, (Merciful) and He will show mercy towards them after they die."
وَلَقَدْ أَنْزَلْنَآ إِلَيْكُمْ آيَاتٍ مُّبَيِّنَاتٍ وَمَثَلاً مِّنَ ٱلَّذِينَ خَلَوْاْ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ وَمَوْعِظَةً لِّلْمُتَّقِينَ,"(And verily We have sent down for you revelations that make plain) He says: We have sent Gabriel to your prophets with revelations that make plain the lawful and the unlawful, the commands and the prohibitions of adultery and indecencies, (and the example of those who passed away before you) the trait of those who passed away from among the believers and disbelievers. (An admonition) a prohibition (unto those who ward off (evil)) adultery and indecencies."
ٱللَّهُ نُورُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ مَثَلُ نُورِهِ كَمِشْكَاةٍ فِيهَا مِصْبَاحٌ ٱلْمِصْبَاحُ فِي زُجَاجَةٍ ٱلزُّجَاجَةُ كَأَنَّهَا كَوْكَبٌ دُرِّيٌّ يُوقَدُ مِن شَجَرَةٍ مُّبَارَكَةٍ زَيْتُونَةٍ لاَّ شَرْقِيَّةٍ وَلاَ غَرْبِيَّةٍ يَكَادُ زَيْتُهَا يُضِيۤءُ وَلَوْ لَمْ تَمْسَسْهُ نَارٌ نُّورٌ عَلَىٰ نُورٍ يَهْدِي ٱللَّهُ لِنُورِهِ مَن يَشَآءُ وَيَضْرِبُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلأَمْثَالَ لِلنَّاسِ وَٱللَّهُ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عَلَيِمٌ,"Allah then mentioned the honour and blessings that He had bestowed upon the believers, saying: (Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth) He is the guide of the dwellers of the heaves and earth. Guidance from Allah is of two types: clarification and making things known; it is also said that the verse means: Allah is the embellisher of the heavens by means of the stars and the embellisher of the earth by means of plants and water; it is also said that this means: Allah enlightens the hearts of the believers among the dwellers of the heavens and the earth. (The similitude of His light) the light of the believers; it is also said that this means: the light of Allah in the heart of the believer (is as a niche wherein is a lamp. The lamp is in a glass) made of gems. (The glass is as it were a shining star) one of the following five planets: Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Mars and Saturn. All these planets are luminous. ((This lamp is) kindled from a blessed tree) from the oil of a blessed tree, (an olive neither of the East nor of the West) in an open space, not touched by the shade of the East nor by the shade of the West; it is also said that this means: in a location which is untouched by the sun when it rises and when it sets, (whose oil) the oil of the tree (would almost glow forth (of itself)) from behind its rind (though no fire touched it. Light upon light) the lamp emits light and the glass emits light and the oil emits light, (Allah guideth unto His light) Allah honours with knowledge; it is also said that this means: Allah honours with His religion (whom He will) whoever deserves it; it is also said that the verse means: the likeness of the light of Muhammad in the loins of his forefathers is like this, up to Allah's saying (… kindled from a blessed tree). He says: the light of Muhammad in Abraham was an upright religion (olive tree), and Abraham was neither Jew nor Christian (neither of the East nor of the West), the works of Abraham would almost glow forth in the loins of his forefathers like this (would almost glow forth (of itself)), up until Allah's saying (kindled from a blessed tree) He says: as if it is the light of Muhammad (pbuh) and if Abraham was not a prophet, he would still have this light (though no fire touched it); it is also said that the latter passage means: Had Allah not honoured Abraham, he would not have had this light; it is also said: if Allah had not honoured His believing servant with this light, he would not have had it."
فِي بُيُوتٍ أَذِنَ ٱللَّهُ أَن تُرْفَعَ وَيُذْكَرَ فِيهَا ٱسْمُهُ يُسَبِّحُ لَهُ فِيهَا بِٱلْغُدُوِّ وَٱلآصَالِ,"((This lamp is found) in houses) these lamps are hung in houses (which Allah hath allowed) which Allah has commanded (to be exalted) to be built; the reference here is to mosques (and that His Name) His divine Oneness (shall be remembered therein) in the mosques. (Therein) in the mosques (do offer praise to Him) pray to Him (at morn) the Fajr prayer (and evening) the prayers of Zuhr, 'Asr, Maghrib and 'Isha'."
رِجَالٌ لاَّ تُلْهِيهِمْ تِجَارَةٌ وَلاَ بَيْعٌ عَن ذِكْرِ ٱللَّهِ وَإِقَامِ ٱلصَّلاَةِ وَإِيتَآءِ ٱلزَّكَـاةِ يَخَافُونَ يَوْماً تَتَقَلَّبُ فِيهِ ٱلْقُلُوبُ وَٱلأَبْصَارُ,"(Men whom neither merchandise) which may bring them profit (nor) hand to hand (sale beguileth) preoccupies (from remembrance of Allah) from the obedience of Allah; it is also said that this means: from performing the five daily prayers (and constancy in prayer) the performance of the five daily prayers with their required ritual ablution, bowings, prostrations and that which is enjoined in their prescribed times (and paying) from their wealth (to the poor their due; who fear a day) who fear the chastisement of the Day of Judgement (when hearts and eyeballs will be overturned) changing from state to state, such that sometimes they are aware and sometimes they are not;"

(Allah giveth blessings without stint to whom He will) He gives to whom He will without measure, or count or ever reminding them of what He gives them as a favour."
وَٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوۤاْ أَعْمَالُهُمْ كَسَرَابٍ بِقِيعَةٍ يَحْسَبُهُ ٱلظَّمْآنُ مَآءً حَتَّىٰ إِذَا جَآءَهُ لَمْ يَجِدْهُ شَيْئاً وَوَجَدَ ٱللَّهَ عِندَهُ فَوَفَّـٰهُ حِسَابَهُ وَٱللَّهُ سَرِيعُ ٱلْحِسَابِ,"(As for those who disbelieve) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an, (their deeds) the similitude of their works in the Hereafter (are as a mirage in a desert. The thirsty one supposeth it to be water) from far (till he cometh unto it and findeth it naught) he finds that it is not water; similarly, the disbeliever will not find any reward for his works in the Hereafter, (and finds, in the place thereof, Allah) and he finds with Allah the punishment for the sins he committed; it is also said that this means: and finds Allah ready to chastise him, (Who payeth him his due) Who inflict on him his punishment; (and Allah is swift at reckoning) Allah is severe in His punishment; it is also said that this means: when Allah takes people to task His reckoning is swift."
أَوْ كَظُلُمَاتٍ فِي بَحْرٍ لُّجِّيٍّ يَغْشَاهُ مَوْجٌ مِّن فَوْقِهِ مَوْجٌ مِّن فَوْقِهِ سَحَابٌ ظُلُمَاتٌ بَعْضُهَا فَوْقَ بَعْضٍ إِذَآ أَخْرَجَ يَدَهُ لَمْ يَكَدْ يَرَاهَا وَمَن لَّمْ يَجْعَلِ ٱللَّهُ لَهُ نُوراً فَمَا لَهُ مِن نُورٍ,"(Or as darkness on a vast, abysmal sea) He says: the similitude of denial in the heart of the disbeliever is like darkness in the depth of a very deep sea. (There covereth him a wave, above which is a wave) another wave, (above which is a cloud) likewise, the heart of the disbeliever, like the denial in his heart, is similar to the darkness of the bottom of the sea; and his heart is like a deep sea; and his chest is like a huge wave, and his works are like a useless cloud, because Allah sealed the disbelievers hearts and hearings and sights. (Layer upon layer of darkness. When he holdeth out his hand he scarce can see it) from intense darkness; likewise, the disbeliever does not see the Truth and guidance because of the intense darkness of his heart. (And he for whom Allah hath not appointed light) knowledge in this worldly life, (for him there is no light) he has no knowledge in the Hereafter; it is also said that this means: the one whom Allah has not honoured with faith in the life of this world, Allah will not honour with faith in the Hereafter."
أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُسَبِّحُ لَهُ مَن فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَٱلطَّيْرُ صَآفَّاتٍ كُلٌّ قَدْ عَلِمَ صَلاَتَهُ وَتَسْبِيحَهُ وَٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ بِمَا يَفْعَلُونَ,"(Hast thou not seen) have you not been informed, O Muhammad, in the Qur'an (that Allah, He it is Whom all who are in the heavens) of angels (and the earth) of believers (praise) pray to; (and the birds) they praise Him (in their flight) spreading their wings? (Of each) one of them (He knoweth verily the worship) who prays to Him (and the praise) who praises His hymn; it is also said that this means: He knows the prayer of the one who prays to Him and the praises of the one who praises Him; (and Allah is Aware of what they do) of good or evil."

The flashing of His lightning) the light emanating from lightning in the clouds (all but snatcheth away the sight) from the intensity of its light."

(Lo! Herein) in the alternation of day and night which I have mentioned (is indeed a lesson) a sign (for those who see) in relation to matters of religion; it is also said that this means: those who see with their eyes.
وَٱللَّهُ خَلَقَ كُلَّ دَآبَّةٍ مِّن مَّآءٍ فَمِنْهُمْ مَّن يَمْشِي عَلَىٰ بَطْنِهِ وَمِنهُمْ مَّن يَمْشِي عَلَىٰ رِجْلَيْنِ وَمِنْهُمْ مَّن يَمْشِي عَلَىٰ أَرْبَعٍ يَخْلُقُ ٱللَّهُ مَا يَشَآءُ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,(Allah hath created every animal) on the face of the earth (of water) from the water of the male and female. (Of them is (a kind) that goeth upon its belly) like the snake and similar animals (and (a kind) that goeth upon two legs) like human beings and those that are similar to them (and (a kind) that goeth upon four) beasts. (Allah createth what He will) as He wills. (Lo! Allah is Able to do all things) whether this concerns creation or other things.
لَّقَدْ أَنزَلْنَآ آيَاتٍ مُّبَيِّنَاتٍ وَٱللَّهُ يَهْدِي مَن يَشَآءُ إِلَىٰ صِرَاطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ,(Verily We have sent down revelations and explained them) He says: We sent Gabriel with revelations expositing the commands and prohibitions. (Allah guideth) to His religion (whom He will) and honours whoever deserves it (unto a straight path) an established religion with which He is pleased: i.e. Islam.
وَيَقُولُونَ آمَنَّا بِٱللَّهِ وَبِٱلرَّسُولِ وَأَطَعْنَا ثُمَّ يَتَوَلَّىٰ فَرِيقٌ مِّنْهُمْ مِّن بَعْدِ ذٰلِكَ وَمَآ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ بِٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,"Allah then revealed the following about the folk of 'Uthman who told the latter: "" do not go to the Prophet (pbuh) in order to settle your dispute with 'Ali regarding a piece of land, because He will take 'Ali's side "" , and 'Uthman rebuked them for saying this: (And they say) i.e. the people of 'Uthman: (We believe in Allah and the messenger) we are sincere in our belief in Allah and the Messenger, (and we obey) that with which we have been commanded; (then after that) after saying this about obeying Allah (a faction of them) of the people of 'Uthman (turn away. Such are not believers) who are sincere in their faith."

(And such are the successful) such are the ones, i.e. 'Uthman Ibn 'Affan, who will escape Allah's wrath and chastisement."
وَمَن يُطِعِ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ وَيَخْشَ ٱللَّهَ وَيَتَّقْهِ فَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْفَآئِزُون,"And Allah also revealed about 'Uthman Ibn 'Affan when he said: “O Messenger of Allah! If you so wish, I will give up all my wealth” and so Allah said: (He who obeyeth Allah and His messenger) in His judgement, (and feareth Allah) in that which has passed, (and keepeth duty (unto Him)) in the future: (such indeed are the victorious) they have gained Paradise and are saved from the Fire."
وَأَقْسَمُواْ بِٱللَّهِ جَهْدَ أَيْمَانِهِمْ لَئِنْ أَمَرْتَهُمْ لَيَخْرُجُنَّ قُل لاَّ تُقْسِمُواْ طَاعَةٌ مَّعْرُوفَةٌ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ خَبِيرٌ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ,"(They swear by Allah solemnly) 'Uthman swore solemnly by Allah (that, if thou order them, they will go forth) he will give up all his wealth. (Say) to them, O Muhammad: (Swear not; known obedience (is better)) if you do so it is a known obedience, but you should obey Allah in relation to that which you have been commanded. (Lo! Allah is Informed of what ye do) of good or evil."

(But if you turn away) but if they turn away from obeying both, (then (it is) for him (to do) only that wherewith he hath been charged) what he has been commanded to convey, (and for you (to do) only that wherewith you have been charged) what you have been commanded to respond. (If ye obey him) if you obey Allah in that which He commands you, (ye will go aright) and avoid error. (But the messenger hath no other charge than to convey (the message) plainly) from Allah."

(They serve Me) in order that they worship Me in Mecca. (They ascribe no thing) no idol (as partner unto Me.

Fire) in the Hereafter (will be their home) their abode, (a hapless journey's end) to which they will return with the satans! This verse was revealed about Abu Jahl and his host."
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ لِيَسْتَأْذِنكُمُ ٱلَّذِينَ مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَـٰنُكُمْ وَٱلَّذِينَ لَمْ يَبْلُغُواْ ٱلْحُلُمَ مِنكُمْ ثَلاَثَ مَرَّاتٍ مِّن قَبْلِ صَـلَٰوةِ ٱلْفَجْرِ وَحِينَ تَضَعُونَ ثِيَـٰبَكُمْ مِّنَ ٱلظَّهِيرَةِ وَمِن بَعْدِ صَلَٰوةِ ٱلْعِشَآءِ ثَلاَثُ عَوْرَاتٍ لَّكُمْ لَيْسَ عَلَيْكُمْ وَلاَ عَلَيْهِمْ جُنَاحٌ بَعْدَهُنَّ طَوَٰفُونَ عَلَيْكُمْ بَعْضُكُمْ عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ كَذَلِكَ يُبَيِّنُ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمُ ٱلأَيَـٰتِ وَٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ حَكِيمٌ,"Then the following was revealed when 'Umar said: "" I wish that Allah forbids our children and servants from entering in on us except with permission at three times when we are likely to be exposed "": (O ye who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an! (Let your slaves) young slaves, (and those of you who have not come to puberty) among those who are not slaves, (ask leave of you) to enter in on you (at three times: Before the prayer of dawn) from the time of dawn until the beginning of Fajr prayer, (and when ye lay aside your raiment for the heat of noon) for the time of the siesta until the prayer of Zuhr, (and after the prayer of night) and after the 'Isha' prayer to the break of dawn. (Three times of privacy for you). Then Allah gave them dispensation to enter without permission, saying: (It is no sin for them) for the children or young slaves, excepting from this older slaves, (or for you) for the masters of the house (at other times) other than those three times of privacy, (when some of you go round) to serve (attendant upon others) you and them can enter in on each other without permission. As for older children and older slaves they have to ask permission at all times before entering in on their parents or masters. (Thus Allah maketh clear the revelations for you) He explains the commands and prohibitions just as He explained this. (Allah is Knower) He knows what is good for you, (Wise) He decreed that young children and slaves ask permission in those three times of privacy."
وَإِذَا بَلَغَ ٱلأَطْفَالُ مِنكُمُ ٱلْحُلُمَ فَلْيَسْتَأْذِنُواْ كَمَا ٱسْتَأْذَنَ ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ كَذٰلِكَ يُبَيِّنُ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمْ آيَاتِهِ وَٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ حَكِيمٌ,"Allah then mentioned only older children and slaves, saying: (And when the children among you come to puberty) whether they are your own children or your slaves (then let them ask leave) at all times (even as those before them) of their brothers who were mentioned before (used to ask it. Thus Allah maketh clear His revelations) His commands and prohibitions as He explained this (for you. Allah is knower) He knows what is good for you, (Wise) He decreed that older people must ask permission at all times."

(But to refrain) to keep their outer garment on (is better for them) than discarding it. (Allah is Hearer) He hears what they say, (Knower) He knows their deeds."

(No sin shall it be for you whether ye eat together) in moderation (or apart) and in this are included the blind, the lame, the sick and other categories of people. (But when ye enter houses) i.e. your houses or mosques and find no one there, (salute one another) say: “peace be upon us from our Lord” (with a greeting from Allah) as an honour from Allah to you, (blessed) with reward (and sweet) with forgiveness. (Thus Allah maketh clear His revelations) He exposits the commands and prohibitions just as He exposited this (for you, that haply ye may understand) what you have been commanded with."

(So, if they ask thy leave) so if sincere believers ask you, O Muhammad, (for some affair of theirs) for a need of theirs, (give leave to whom thou wilt of them) of the sincere believers, (and ask for them forgiveness of Allah) regarding that for which they have gone.

(It was not for us) we had no right (to choose) to worship (any protecting friends beside Thee) as lords; it is also said that this means: they said, i.e. the angels, glory be to You! We were not permitted to worship any lords besides You, so how could we have command them to worship us? (but Thou didst give them and their fathers) before them (ease) You gave them a reprieve in their state of disbelief (till they forgot the warning) until they shunned professing Your divine Oneness and refrained from worshipping you (and became lost folk) doomed for destruction and whose hearts became evil."

(And We have appointed some of you a test) a trial (for others) We test the pure Arab with the client, and the noble by birth with the lowly and the rich with the poor; Allah said to Abu Jahl and his host: (Will ye be steadfast) with the Companions of the Prophet (pbuh) Salman and his fellow believers, such that you become with them, in relation to Religion and other matters, equal and that you sit together with them? (And thy Lord is ever Seer) that they will not be steadfast regarding this.

(Assuredly they think too highly of themselves) to simply believe; it is also said that this means: they think too highly of themselves when they ask to see Allah, (and are scornful with great pride) refusing to believe; it is also said that they dared to ask for a tremendous thing when they asked for the angels to come to them."
يَوْمَ يَرَوْنَ ٱلْمَلاَئِكَةَ لاَ بُشْرَىٰ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُجْرِمِينَ وَيَقُولُونَ حِجْراً مَّحْجُوراً,"(On the day) which is the Day of Judgement (when they behold the angels) at the moment of death, (on that day there will be no good tidings) the angels will say to them: there is no good tidings, i.e. there is no Paradise (for the guilty) for the idolaters; (and they will cry) i.e. the angels will cry: (A forbidding ban) the glad tiding of Paradise is forbidden for the disbelievers; and it is also said that this means: the disbelievers will say upon seeing the angels: let a great distance be between you and us!"
وَقَدِمْنَآ إِلَىٰ مَا عَمِلُواْ مِنْ عَمَلٍ فَجَعَلْنَاهُ هَبَآءً مَّنثُوراً,"(And We shall turn unto the work they did) the good work they did in the life of this world (and make it) in the Hereafter (scattered motes) like scattered dust in the hooves of beasts; it is also said that this means: like tiny particles of dust which can be seen when, from a hole, light enters into a dark place, but these particles cannot be touched even though one can see them."
أَصْحَابُ ٱلْجَنَّةِ يَوْمَئِذٍ خَيْرٌ مُّسْتَقَرّاً وَأَحْسَنُ مَقِيلاً,(Those who have earned the Garden) Muhammad (pbuh) and his Companions (on that day) the Day of Judgement (will be better in their home) abode (and happier in their place of noonday rest) better and happier than the homes and places of Abu Jahl and their hosts;
وَيَوْمَ تَشَقَّقُ ٱلسَّمَآءُ بِٱلْغَمَامِ وَنُزِّلَ ٱلْمَلاَئِكَةُ تَنزِيلاً,"(A day when the heaven with the clouds will be rent asunder) for the descent of Allah and this descent is without any modality (bi-la kayf) (and the angels will be sent down, a grand descent) one after another."
ٱلْمُلْكُ يَوْمَئِذٍ ٱلْحَقُّ لِلرَّحْمَـٰنِ وَكَانَ يَوْماً عَلَى ٱلْكَافِرِينَ عَسِيراً,"(The Sovereignty) judgement (on that day will be the True (Sovereignty)) justice (belonging to the Beneficent One, and it will be a hard day for disbelievers) the hardship of that Day is very severe on them."
وَيَوْمَ يَعَضُّ ٱلظَّالِمُ عَلَىٰ يَدَيْهِ يَقُولُ يٰلَيْتَنِي ٱتَّخَذْتُ مَعَ ٱلرَّسُولِ سَبِيلاً,"(On the day when the wrong-doer) the disbeliever, i.e. 'Uqbah Ibn Ma'it (gnaweth his hands) his fingers, (he will say: Ah, would that I had chosen a way together with the messenger (of Allah)) would that I had chosen, and were upright in following the religion of the Prophet!"
يَٰوَيْلَتَىٰ لَيْتَنِي لَمْ أَتَّخِذْ فُلاَناً خَلِيلاً,"(Alas for me! Ah, would that I had never taken such an one) Ubayy Ibn Khalaf (for friend) following his religion!"
لَّقَدْ أَضَلَّنِي عَنِ ٱلذِّكْرِ بَعْدَ إِذْ جَآءَنِي وَكَانَ ٱلشَّيْطَانُ لِلإِنْسَانِ خَذُولاً,(He verily led me astray from the Reminder) from Allah's divine Oneness and obedience (after it had reached me) after Muhammad (pbuh) reached me with Allah's divine Oneness. (Satan was ever man's deserter in the hour of need) he lets him down at the time of need.
وَقَالَ ٱلرَّسُولُ يٰرَبِّ إِنَّ قَوْمِي ٱتَّخَذُواْ هَـٰذَا ٱلْقُرْآنَ مَهْجُوراً,"(And the messenger) Muhammad (pbuh) (saith: O my Lord! Lo! mine own folk make this Qur'an of no account) they speak ill of it, they do not believe in it and do not act upon its teachings."
وَكَذَلِكَ جَعَلْنَا لِكُلِّ نَبِيٍّ عَدُوّاً مِّنَ ٱلْمُجْرِمِينَ وَكَفَىٰ بِرَبِّكَ هَادِياً وَنَصِيراً,(Even so) just as We have appointed Abu Jahl as your enemy (have We appointed unto every Prophet) before you (an opponent from among the guilty) from the idolaters of his people; (but Allah sufficeth for a Guide) a Preserver (and Helper) and Defender against what they plot against you.
وَقَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لَوْلاَ نُزِّلَ عَلَيْهِ ٱلْقُرْآنُ جُمْلَةً وَاحِدَةً كَذَلِكَ لِنُثَبِّتَ بِهِ فُؤَادَكَ وَرَتَّلْنَاهُ تَرْتِيلاً,"(And those who disbelieve) Abu Jahl and his host (say: Why is the Qur'an not revealed unto him all at once) just like the Torah was revealed all at once to Moses, and the Gospel to Jesus and the Psalms to David? ((It is revealed) thus) He says: We have sent Gabriel with the Qur'an in instalments (that We may strengthen thy heart therewith) that We may gladden your heart and preserve your heart; (and We have arranged it in right order) We exposited it by detailing the commands and prohibitions; it is also said that this means: We have sent Gabriel with the Qur'an in instalments verse after verse."
وَلاَ يَأْتُونَكَ بِمَثَلٍ إِلاَّ جِئْنَاكَ بِٱلْحَقِّ وَأَحْسَنَ تَفْسِيراً,"(And they bring thee) O Muhammad (no similitude) no description, proof or explanation (but We bring thee the Truth) with a description, exposition and proof that contradict their proof (and better (than their similitude) as argument) and better explanation and proof than their proof."
ٱلَّذِينَ يُحْشَرُونَ عَلَىٰ وُجُوهِهِمْ إِلَىٰ جَهَنَّمَ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ شَرٌّ مَّكَاناً وَأَضَلُّ سَبِيلاً,(Those who will be gathered) will be dragged (on their faces unto hell) i.e. Abu Jahl and his host: (such are worse in plight) they have a worse abode in the Hereafter and worse works in this worldly life (and further from the right road) from the Truth and guidance.
وَلَقَدْ آتَيْنَا مُوسَى ٱلْكِتَابَ وَجَعَلْنَا مَعَهُ أَخَاهُ هَارُونَ وَزِيراً,(We verify gave Moses the Scripture) the Torah (and placed with him his brother Aaron as henchman) as helper.
فَقُلْنَا ٱذْهَبَآ إِلَى ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلَّذِينَ كَذَّبُواْ بِآيَاتِنَا فَدَمَّرْنَاهُمْ تَدْمِيراً,"(Then We said: Go together unto the folk who have denied Our revelations) those who disbelieved in Our nine signs, i.e. Pharaoh and his people, the Copts. (Then We destroyed them, a complete destruction) by drowning them."
وَقَوْمَ نُوحٍ لَّمَّا كَذَّبُواْ ٱلرُّسُلَ أَغْرَقْنَاهُمْ وَجَعَلْنَاهُمْ لِلنَّاسِ آيَةً وَأَعْتَدْنَا لِلظَّالِمِينَ عَذَاباً أَلِيماً,"(And Noah's folk) and We destroyed the people of Noah, (when they denied the messengers) i.e. Noah and the rest of messengers, (We drowned them) by means of the flood (and made of them a portent for mankind) We made them an admonition for other people so that they do not follow their example. (We have prepared a painful doom) in the Fire (for evil-doers) for the idolaters, the idolaters of Mecca."
وَعَاداً وَثَمُودَاْ وَأَصْحَابَ ٱلرَّسِّ وَقُرُوناً بَيْنَ ذَلِكَ كَثِيراً,"(And (the tribes of) 'Aad) and We destroyed the people of Hud (and Thamud) the people of Salih, (and the dwellers in Ar-Rass) the people of Shu'ayb, (and many generations in between) We destroyed them all, even though We have not mentioned them by name."
وَكُلاًّ ضَرَبْنَا لَهُ ٱلأَمْثَالَ وَكُلاًّ تَبَّرْنَا تَتْبِيراً,"(Each (of them) We warned by examples) We explained to each generation the chastisement We inflicted upon the generations before them, but still they did not believe, (and each (of them) We brought to utter ruin) one after the other."
وَلَقَدْ أَتَوْا عَلَى ٱلْقَرْيَةِ ٱلَّتِيۤ أُمْطِرَتْ مَطَرَ ٱلسَّوْءِ أَفَلَمْ يَكُونُواْ يَرَوْنَهَا بَلْ كَانُواْ لاَ يَرْجُونَ نُشُوراً,"(And indeed they) the people of Mecca (have passed by the township) the town of Lot (whereon was rained the fatal rain) a rain of stones. (Can it be that they have not seen it) have they not seen what was done to it and to its people, and thus refrain from disbelieving in you and in what you say? (Nay, but they hope for no resurrection) they do not fear resurrection after death."
وَإِذَا رَأَوْكَ إِن يَتَّخِذُونَكَ إِلاَّ هُزُواً أَهَـٰذَا ٱلَّذِي بَعَثَ ٱللَّهُ رَسُولاً,(And when they) the disbelievers of Mecca (see thee (O Muhammad) they treat thee only as a jest) they only speak to you in jest and derision ((saying): Is this he whom Allah sendeth as a messenger) to us?
إِن كَادَ لَيُضِلُّنَا عَنْ آلِهَتِنَا لَوْلاَ أَن صَبْرَنَا عَلَيْهَا وَسَوْفَ يَعْلَمُونَ حِينَ يَرَوْنَ ٱلْعَذَابَ مَنْ أَضَلُّ سَبِيلاً,"(He would have led us far away from our gods) from the worship of our deities (if we had not been staunch to them) if we had not been staunch in worshipping them. (They will know) this is a threat to them from Allah, (when they behold the doom, who is more astray as to the road) as to Religion and proof."
أَرَأَيْتَ مَنِ ٱتَّخَذَ إِلَـٰهَهُ هَوَاهُ أَفَأَنتَ تَكُونُ عَلَيْهِ وَكِيلاً,"(Hast thou) O Muhammad (seen him who chooseth for his god his own lust) who worshipped his god, i.e. al-Nadr and his host, out of the whim of his ego? (Wouldst thou) O Muhammad (then be guardian over him) a protector against going out for such corruption? But this was abrogated by the verse of jihad; it is also said that this means: would you be their protector from chastisement?"
أَمْ تَحْسَبُ أَنَّ أَكْثَرَهُمْ يَسْمَعُونَ أَوْ يَعْقِلُونَ إِنْ هُمْ إِلاَّ كَٱلأَنْعَامِ بَلْ هُمْ أَضَلُّ سَبِيلاً,"(Or deemest thou) O Muhammad (that most of them hear) the Truth (or understand) such Truth when they listen to your words? (They are) in relation to understanding the Truth (but as the cattle) which know nothing but eating and drinking; they are with regard to the Truth like this, (nay, but they are farther astray) from proof and Religion! Because the cattle have no ability to understand proofs."
أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَىٰ رَبِّكَ كَيْفَ مَدَّ ٱلظِّلَّ وَلَوْ شَآءَ لَجَعَلَهُ سَاكِناً ثُمَّ جَعَلْنَا ٱلشَّمْسَ عَلَيْهِ دَلِيلاً,"(Hast thou not seen how thy Lord hath spread the shade) after sunrise and before sunset, from the East to the West. (And if He willed He could have made it) i.e. the shade (still) with no sun, (then We have made the sun its) the shade's (pilot) wherever one finds the sun one expects to find the shade before that; it is also said that this means: a guide which comes after it;"
ثُمَّ قَبَضْنَاهُ إِلَيْنَا قَبْضاً يَسِيراً,"(Then We withdraw it) i.e. the shade (unto Us, a gradual withdrawal) a slight-or as it is said: hidden-withdrawal?"

وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِي خَلَقَ مِنَ ٱلْمَآءِ بَشَراً فَجَعَلَهُ نَسَباً وَصِهْراً وَكَانَ رَبُّكَ قَدِيراً,"(And He it is Who hath created man from water) from the water of the male and female, (and hath appointed for him kindred by blood) who are unmarriageable (and kindred by marriage) who are marriageable, whether they are relatives or not; (for thy Lord is) in relation to the lawful and the unlawful which He created (ever Powerful."

(The disbeliever) Abu Jahl (was ever a partisan) rebellious (against his Lord) it is also that this means: he is always a helper, through his disbelief, to the disbelievers against his Lord."
وَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَاكَ إِلاَّ مُبَشِّراً وَنَذِيراً,(And We have sent thee) O Muhammad to the people of Mecca (only as a bearer of good tidings) Paradise (and a warner) from the Fire.

The Beneficent! Ask any one informed concerning Him) ask those who possess knowledge about Allah, and they will inform you!"

(they say: And what is the Beneficent) we do not know anyone with this name except Musaylimah the liar? (Are we to adore whatever thou (Muhammad) biddest us) a manifest lie? (And it) i.e. the mention of the Beneficent; and it is said: the mention of the Qur'an; and it is said the call of the Prophet (pbuh) (increaseth aversion in them) from faith.

طسۤمۤ,"And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said about the interpretation of Allah's saying (Ta. Sin. Mim.): '(Ta. Sin. Mim.) He says: Ta stands for His might (tawluh) and power, Sin stands for His majesty (sana'uh), and Mim stands for His dominion (mulkuh); it is also said that (Ta. Sin. Mim.) is an oath by which Allah swore."

فَقَدْ كَذَّبُواْ فَسَيَأْتِيهِمْ أَنبَاءُ مَا كَانُواْ بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِئُونَ,(Now they have denied) Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an; (but there will come unto them tidings) the news (of that whereat they used to scoff) of chastisement; it is also said that this means: there will come to them the news of their derision of Muhammad (pbuh) and of the Qur'an.
أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْاْ إِلَى ٱلأَرْضِ كَمْ أَنبَتْنَا فِيهَا مِن كُلِّ زَوْجٍ كَرِيمٍ,"(Have they) the disbelievers of Mecca (not seen the earth, how much of every fruitful kind We make to grow therein?)"
إِنَّ فِي ذَلِكَ لآيَةً وَمَا كَانَ أَكْثَرُهُمْ مُّؤْمِنِينَ,"(Lo! Herein) in the different kinds of fruit (is indeed a portent) a sign and an admonition; (yet most of them are not believers) they were not believers, and all of them were disbelievers, i.e. those who perished at Badr."
وَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَهُوَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلرَّحِيمُ,"(And lo! thy Lord! He is indeed the Mighty) in retribution against the disbelievers, (the Merciful) towards the believers."
وَإِذْ نَادَىٰ رَبُّكَ مُوسَىٰ أَنِ ٱئْتِ ٱلْقَوْمَ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ,"(And when thy Lord called Moses) it is also said that this means: and when your Lord commanded Moses, (saying: Go unto the wrong-doing folk) the disbelieving folk,"
قَوْمَ فِرْعَوْنَ أَلا يَتَّقُونَ,(The folk of Pharaoh. Will they not ward off (evil)) and tell: will they not ward off the worship of other than Allah?
قَالَ رَبِّ إِنِّيۤ أَخَافُ أَن يُكَذِّبُونِ,"(He said) Moses said: (My Lord! Lo! I fear that they will deny me) I fear that they will disbelieve in the message I bring to them,"
وَيَضِيقُ صَدْرِي وَلاَ يَنطَلِقُ لِسَانِي فَأَرْسِلْ إِلَىٰ هَارُونَ,"(And I shall be embarrassed) because of their denial; it is also said that this means: and my heart will shrink from delivering the message, (and my tongue will not speak plainly) out of awe of him, (therefore send for Aaron (to help me)) send Aaron with me to support me; it is also said that this means: send Gabriel to Aaron so that he helps me."
وَلَهُمْ عَلَيَّ ذَنبٌ فَأَخَافُ أَن يَقْتُلُونِ,"(And they have a crime against me) they may retaliate against me because I killed the Copt, (so I fear that they will kill me) because of this Copt that I killed."
قَالَ كَلاَّ فَٱذْهَبَا بِآيَاتِنَآ إِنَّا مَعَكُمْ مُّسْتَمِعُونَ,"(He said) Allah said: (Nay, verily) I will not set them against you to kill you. (So go ye twain with Our tokens) with Our nine signs: the hand, the staff, the flood, the locusts, the lice, the frogs, blood, the lack of foodstuff and drought. (Lo! We shall be with you) We shall help you, (Hearing) what he says to you."
فَأْتِيَا فِرْعَوْنَ فَقُولاۤ إِنَّا رَسُولُ رَبِّ ٱلْعَالَمِينَ,"(And come together unto Pharaoh and say: Lo! we bear a message of the Lord of the Worlds) to you and to your people,"
أَنْ أَرْسِلْ مَعَنَا بَنِيۤ إِسْرَائِيلَ,((Saying): Let the Children of Israel go with Us) and do not torture them.
قَالَ أَلَمْ نُرَبِّكَ فِينَا وَلِيداً وَلَبِثْتَ فِينَا مِنْ عُمُرِكَ سِنِينَ,"(He said): Pharaoh looked at Moses and said: (Did we not rear thee among us as a child?) O Moses (And thou didst dwell many years of your life among us) and stayed with us for 30 years,"
وَفَعَلْتَ فَعْلَتَكَ ٱلَّتِي فَعَلْتَ وَأَنتَ مِنَ ٱلْكَافِرِينَ,"(And thou didst that thy deed which thou didst) and you killed the person that you killed, (and thou wast one of the ingrates) and you are now ungrateful for my kindness,"
قَالَ فَعَلْتُهَآ إِذاً وَأَنَاْ مِنَ ٱلضَّالِّينَ,"(He said) Moses said: (I did it then, when I was of those who are astray) when I was ungrateful for your kindness."
فَفَرَرْتُ مِنكُمْ لَمَّا خِفْتُكُمْ فَوَهَبَ لِي رَبِّي حُكْماً وَجَعَلَنِي مِنَ ٱلْمُرْسَلِينَ,"(Then I fled from you when I feared you) when I feared that you would kill me, (and my Lord vouchsafed me a command) understanding, knowledge and prophethood (and appointed me (of the number) of those sent (by Him)) He made me a Messenger to you and to your people."
وَتِلْكَ نِعْمَةٌ تَمُنُّهَا عَلَيَّ أَنْ عَبَّدتَّ بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ,"(And this is the past favour wherewith) with which (thou reproachest me) O Pharaoh, but you do not recall your aloofness towards me: (that thou hast enslaved the Children of Israel."
قَالَ فِرْعَوْنُ وَمَا رَبُّ ٱلْعَالَمِينَ,(Pharaoh said) to Moses: (And what is the Lord of the Worlds) who is the Lord of the Worlds? Is it me you are referring to?
قَالَ رَبُّ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَآ إِن كُنتُمْ مُّوقِنِينَ,"((Moses) said: Lord of the heavens and the earth) the Lord of the Worlds is the Lord of the heavens and the earth (and all that is between them) of created beings and marvels, (if ye had but sure belief) that Allah has created them."
قَالَ لِمَنْ حَوْلَهُ أَلاَ تَسْتَمِعُونَ,"((Pharaoh) said unto those around him) of attendants: (Hear ye not) what Moses says? There were around Pharaoh at that time 250 men wearing attires made of silk brocade plaited with gold. These men were Pharaoh's closest courtiers, and they asked Moses: who is this Lord of the heavens and the earth to whom you are calling us?"
قَالَ رَبُّكُمْ وَرَبُّ آبَآئِكُمُ ٱلأَوَّلِينَ,(He said) Moses said: (Your Lord) He is your Lord (and the Lord of your fathers.
قَالَ إِنَّ رَسُولَكُمُ ٱلَّذِيۤ أُرْسِلَ إِلَيْكُمْ لَمَجْنُونٌ,"(Pharaoh) said: Lo! your messenger who hath been sent unto you is indeed a madman!) They said: who is this that you are calling us to? And who is this Lord of ours who is also the Lord of our fathers, O Moses?"
قَالَ رَبُّ ٱلْمَشْرِقِ وَٱلْمَغْرِبِ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَآ إِن كُنتُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ,"(He said) Moses said: (Lord of the East) He is the Lord of the East (and the West) and the Lord of the West (and all that is between them, if ye did but understand) if you did but believe."
قَالَ لَئِنِ ٱتَّخَذْتَ إِلَـٰهَاً غَيْرِي لأَجْعَلَنَّكَ مِنَ ٱلْمَسْجُونِينَ,"((Pharaoh) said: If thou choosest) if you worship (a god other than me) O Moses, (I assuredly shall place thee among the prisoners) his prisons were worse than death, for he used to put people in complete isolation, unable to see or hear anyone."
قَالَ أَوَلَوْ جِئْتُكَ بِشَيءٍ مُّبِينٍ,(He said) Moses said: (Even though I show thee) O Pharaoh (something plain) a sign that serves as proof for what I say?
قَالَ فَأْتِ بِهِ إِن كُنتَ مِنَ ٱلصَّادِقِينَ,"((Pharaoh) said: Produce it then) O Moses, (if thou art of the Truthful) that you are a Messenger to me and to my people!"
فَأَلْقَىٰ عَصَاهُ فَإِذَا هِيَ ثُعْبَانٌ مُّبِينٌ,"(Then he) Moses (flung down his staff and it became a serpent) a yellow, male serpent (manifest) as huge as any serpent can be,"
وَنَزَعَ يَدَهُ فَإِذَا هِيَ بَيْضَآءُ لِلنَّاظِرِينَ,"Pharaoh then said: “this is a manifest sign, do you have any other signs?” (And he drew forth his hand) from his armpit (and lo! it was white to the beholders) his hand had a light like the light of the sun, and whoever looked at it liked it."
قَالَ لِلْمَلإِ حَوْلَهُ إِنَّ هَـٰذَا لَسَاحِرٌ عَلِيمٌ,"((Pharaoh) said unto the chiefs about him: Lo, this) messenger (is verily a knowing wizard) who is very skilful in magic,"
يُرِيدُ أَن يُخْرِجَكُمْ مِّنْ أَرْضِكُمْ بِسِحْرِهِ فَمَاذَا تَأْمُرُونَ,(Who would drive you out of your land) Egypt (by his magic. Now what counsel ye) what do you suggest that I should do?
قَالُوۤاْ أَرْجِهْ وَأَخَاهُ وَٱبْعَثْ فِي ٱلْمَدَآئِنِ حَاشِرِينَ,"(They said: Put him off) retain him, ((him) and his brother) and do not kill them, (and send them) i.e. the police (into the cities) the cities where the wizards are found (summoners) to summon these wizards,"
يَأْتُوكَ بِكُلِّ سَحَّارٍ عَلِيمٍ,(Who shall bring unto thee every knowing wizard) who is skilful in magic so that they can do what Moses did.
فَجُمِعَ ٱلسَّحَرَةُ لِمِيقَاتِ يَوْمٍ مَّعْلُومٍ,"(So the wizards were gathered together) there were 72 of them (at a set time on a day appointed) which was the day of the market, and it also said that it was the day of their festival, and it is also said that it was the day of their new year."
وَقِيلَ لِلنَّاسِ هَلْ أَنتُمْ مُّجْتَمِعُونَ,(And it was said unto the people: Are ye (also) gathering?
لَعَلَّنَا نَتَّبِعُ ٱلسَّحَرَةَ إِن كَانُواْ هُمُ ٱلْغَالِبِينَ,"(They said): Aye, so that we may follow the wizards) that we may follow the religion of the wizards (if they are the winners) against Moses."
فَلَمَّا جَآءَ ٱلسَّحَرَةُ قَالُواْ لِفِرْعَوْنَ أَإِنَّ لَنَا لأَجْراً إِن كُنَّا نَحْنُ ٱلْغَالِبِينَ,(And when the wizards came they said unto Pharaoh: Will there surely be a reward for us if we are the winners) against Moses?
قَالَ نَعَمْ وَإِنَّكُمْ إِذاً لَّمِنَ ٱلْمُقَرَّبِينَ,"(He said) Pharaoh said: (Aye) you will have that, (and ye will then surely be of those brought near) in terms of status, position and attending my assembly."
قَالَ لَهُمْ مُّوسَىٰ أَلْقُواْ مَآ أَنتُمْ مُّلْقُونَ,(Moses said unto them) he said to the wizards: (Throw what ye are going to throw!
فَأَلْقَوْاْ حِبَالَهُمْ وَعِصِيَّهُمْ وَقَالُواْ بِعِزَّةِ فِرْعَونَ إِنَّا لَنَحْنُ ٱلْغَالِبُونَ,"Then they threw down their cords and their staves) 72 ropes and 72 staffs (and said) i.e. the wizards said: (By Pharaoh's might, lo! we verily are the winners) against Moses."
فَأَلْقَىٰ مُوسَىٰ عَصَاهُ فَإِذَا هِيَ تَلْقَفُ مَا يَأْفِكُونَ,(Then Moses threw his staff and lo! it swallowed that which they did falsely show) of wizardry.
فَأُلْقِيَ ٱلسَّحَرَةُ سَاجِدِينَ,"(And the wizards were flung prostrate) they fell prostrate so fast that it looked that they were thrown to the floor, because when they saw their ropes and staffs disappear, they knew that what Moses brought was from Allah,"
قَالُواْ آمَنَّا بِرَبِّ ٱلْعَالَمِينَ,(Crying: We believe in the Lord of the Worlds) upon which Pharaoh said: are you referring to me?
رَبِّ مُوسَىٰ وَهَارُونَ,They said: (The Lord of Moses and Aaron.
قَالَ آمَنتُمْ لَهُ قَبْلَ أَنْ آذَنَ لَكُمْ إِنَّهُ لَكَبِيرُكُمُ ٱلَّذِي عَلَّمَكُمُ ٱلسِّحْرَ فَلَسَوْفَ تَعْلَمُونَ لأُقَطِّعَنَّ أَيْدِيَكُمْ وَأَرْجُلَكُمْ مِّنْ خِلاَفٍ وَلأُصَلِّبَنَّكُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ,"(Pharaoh) said, You put your faith in him) you believed in him (before I give you leave) I commanded you to do so. (Lo! He) i.e. Moses (doubtless is your chief) your master wizard (who taught you magic! But verily ye shall come to know) what I will do to you. (Verily I will cut off your hands and your feet alternately) the right hand with the left leg, (and verily I will crucify you everyone) on the bank of the river of Egypt."
قَالُواْ لاَ ضَيْرَ إِنَّآ إِلَىٰ رَبِّنَا مُنقَلِبُونَ,"(They said: It is no hurt) what you do with us in this worldly life will not harm us in the Hereafter, (for lo! unto our Lord we shall return) we shall return to Allah and His reward."
إِنَّا نَطْمَعُ أَن يَغْفِرَ لَنَا رَبُّنَا خَطَايَانَآ أَن كُنَّآ أَوَّلَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,(Lo! we ardently hope that our Lord will forgive us our sins) our idolatry (because we are the first of the believers) in Moses.
وَأَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَىٰ مُوسَىٰ أَنْ أَسْرِ بِعِبَادِيۤ إِنَّكُم مّتَّبَعُونَ,"(And We inspired Moses, saying: Take away My slaves by night) take by night whoever believes in you from among the Children of Israel, (for ye will be pursued) Pharaoh and his people will catch up with you."
فَأَرْسَلَ فِرْعَونُ فِي ٱلْمَدَآئِنِ حَاشِرِينَ,"(Then Pharaoh sent into the cities summoners) he summoned his police force,"
إِنَّ هَـٰؤُلاۤءِ لَشِرْذِمَةٌ قَلِيلُونَ,"((Who said): Lo! These) the followers of Moses (indeed are but a little troop) a small group,"
وَإِنَّهُمْ لَنَا لَغَآئِظُونَ,(And lo! they are offenders against us) they have caused our fury and anger.
وَإِنَّا لَجَمِيعٌ حَاذِرُونَ,"(And lo! we are a ready host) we are in doubt, and we will supply weapons."
فَأَخْرَجْنَاهُمْ مِّن جَنَّاتٍ وَعُيُونٍ,"(Thus did We take them away from gardens and water springs) pure water,"
وَكُنُوزٍ وَمَقَامٍ كَرِيمٍ,(And treasures) wealth (and a fair estate) beautiful houses.
كَذَلِكَ وَأَوْرَثْنَاهَا بَنِيۤ إِسْرَائِيلَ,"(Thus) I do with the ones who disobey Me, (and We caused the Children of Israel to inherit them) to inherit Egypt after their destruction."
فَأَتْبَعُوهُم مُّشْرِقِينَ,(And they overtook them at sunrise.
فَلَمَّا تَرَاءَى ٱلْجَمْعَانِ قَالَ أَصْحَابُ مُوسَىٰ إِنَّا لَمُدْرَكُونَ,"(And when the two hosts) the group of Moses and that of Pharaoh (saw each other, those with Moses said: Lo! we are indeed caught) O Moses, they have caught up with us."
قَالَ كَلاَّ إِنَّ مَعِيَ رَبِّي سَيَهْدِينِ,"(He said) Moses said: (Nay) they have not, (verily! for lo! my Lord is with me. He will guide me) He will save me from them and guide me to the right way."
فَأَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَىٰ مُوسَىٰ أَنِ ٱضْرِب بِّعَصَاكَ ٱلْبَحْرَ فَٱنفَلَقَ فَكَانَ كُلُّ فِرْقٍ كَٱلطَّوْدِ ٱلْعَظِيمِ,"(Then We inspired Moses, saying: Smite the sea with thy staff. And) when he hit it (it parted) into 12 roads, (and each part) and each road (was as a mountain vast) like a huge mountain."
وَأَزْلَفْنَا ثَمَّ ٱلآخَرِينَ,"(Then brought We near the others to that place) then We kept Pharaoh and his people in the cloud, and it is said in the sea, and all of them were disbelievers."
وَأَنجَيْنَا مُوسَىٰ وَمَن مَّعَهُ أَجْمَعِينَ,"(And We saved Moses and those with him, every one) from drowning;"
ثُمَّ أَغْرَقْنَا ٱلآخَرِينَ,(We drowned the others) Pharaoh and his host in the sea.
إِنَّ فِي ذَلِكَ لآيَةً وَمَا كَانَ أَكْثَرُهُم مُّؤْمِنِينَ,"(Lo! Herein) in that which We did to them (is indeed a portent) a sign and an admonition, (yet most of them are not believers) most of them were not believers."

يُلْقُونَ ٱلسَّمْعَ وَأَكْثَرُهُمْ كَاذِبُونَ,"(They listen eagerly) the devils listen eagerly to the speech of the angels, (but most of them are liars) the devils are liars because they hear one thing and convey instead 100 things to fortune tellers."
وَٱلشُّعَرَآءُ يَتَّبِعُهُمُ ٱلْغَاوُونَ,"(As for poets) 'Abdullah Ibn al-Zib'ari and his host who composed poetry, (the erring follow them) those who transmit poetry relate it from them."
أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّهُمْ فِي كُلِّ وَادٍ يَهِيمُونَ,"(Hast thou not seen how they) the poets (stray) they come and go, sometimes eulogizing and sometimes satirizing (in every valley) in every genre and theme,"
وَأَنَّهُمْ يَقُولُونَ مَا لاَ يَفْعَلُونَ,(And how they say) in their poetry (that which they do not?) they keep mentioning “I” and “I” when things are not as they say; it is also said that this means: they say things which they cannot do; and hence both poet and narrator are in error.
إِلاَّ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ وَذَكَرُواْ ٱللَّهَ كَثِيراً وَٱنتَصَرُواْ مِن بَعْدِ مَا ظُلِمُواْ وَسَيَعْلَمْ ٱلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوۤاْ أَيَّ مُنقَلَبٍ يَنقَلِبُونَ,"(Save those who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an, like Hassan Ibn Thabit and his fellow believing poets (and do good works) between them and their Lord, (and remember Allah much) in their poetry, (and vindicate themselves) through Muhammad (pbuh) and his Companions by answering back the disbelievers (after they have been wronged) after being satirized by the disbelievers. (Those who do wrong) those who satirized the Prophet (pbuh) and his Companions (will come to know by what a (great) reverse they will be overturned!) what kind of destination they will return to in the Hereafter, i.e. the Fire, if they do not believe. And Allah knows best the secrets of His Book'."
طسۤ تِلْكَ آيَاتُ ٱلْقُرْآنِ وَكِتَابٍ مُّبِينٍ,And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said regarding the interpretation of Allah's saying (Ta. Sin.): '(Ta. Sin.) He says: the (Ta) stands for His might (tawluh) and the (Sin) stands for His majesty (sana'uh); it is also said that it is an oath by which Allah swore. (These are revelations of the Qur'an and a Scripture that maketh plain) this surah consists of verses of the Qur'an and it is a Book that makes plain the lawful and the unlawful;
هُدًى وَبُشْرَىٰ لِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,(A guidance) from error (and good tidings) that they will gain Paradise (for believers) who are true in their faith.
ٱلَّذِينَ يُقِيمُونَ ٱلصَّلاَةَ وَيُؤْتُونَ ٱلزَّكَاةَ وَهُم بِٱلآخِرَةِ هُمْ يُوقِنُونَ,"Allah then showed the attributes of these true believers, saying: (Who establish worship) those who complete the five daily prayers along with their necessary ritual ablution, bowing, prostrating and all that which is obligated in their due times (and pay the poor-due) from their wealth (and are sure of) they believe in (the Hereafter) resurrection after death, Paradise and hell."
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱلآخِرَةِ زَيَّنَّا لَهُمْ أَعْمَالَهُمْ فَهُمْ يَعْمَهُونَ,"(Lo! as for those who believe not in the Hereafter) those who do not believe in resurrection after death: Abu Jahl and his host, (We have made their works fair-seeming unto them) in their state of disbelief (so that they are all astray) so they proceed blindly, unable to see."
أُوْلَـٰئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ لَهُمْ سُوۤءُ ٱلْعَذَابِ وَهُمْ فِي ٱلآخِرَةِ هُمُ ٱلأَخْسَرُونَ,"(Those) who have this attribute (are they for whom is the worst of punishment) a severe chastisement in the Fire, (and in the Hereafter) on the Day of Judgement (they will be the greatest losers) they will loose Paradise and enter the Fire."
وَإِنَّكَ لَتُلَقَّى ٱلْقُرْآنَ مِن لَّدُنْ حَكِيمٍ عَلِيمٍ,"(Lo! as for thee) O Muhammad, (thou verily receivest the Qur'an) He says: Gabriel comes down to you with the Qur'an (from the presence of One Wise) in His command and judgement, (Aware) of His created beings."
إِذْ قَالَ مُوسَىٰ لأَهْلِهِ إِنِّيۤ آنَسْتُ نَاراً سَآتِيكُمْ مِّنْهَا بِخَبَرٍ أَوْ آتِيكُمْ بِشِهَابٍ قَبَسٍ لَّعَلَّكُمْ تَصْطَلُونَ,"((Remember) when Moses said unto his household) when he became unsure about the way: (Lo! I spy afar off a fire) on the left side of the road; stay here (I will bring you tidings thence) news about the right way to take, (or bring to you a borrowed flame that ye may warm yourselves) because this happened in a cold winter."
فَلَمَّا جَآءَهَا نُودِيَ أَن بُورِكَ مَن فِي ٱلنَّارِ وَمَنْ حَوْلَهَا وَسُبْحَانَ ٱللَّهِ رَبِّ ٱلْعَالَمِينَ,"(But when he reached it, he was called, saying: Blessed is whosoever is in the Fire) blessed is the Fire (and whosoever is round about it) of angels! This is the reading of Ubayy and 'Abdullah Ibn Mas'ud; it is also said that this means: blessed is He Who lightened this light; and it also said that this means: blessed is he who is seeking, i.e. Moses and whoever is around him of angels, (And glorified be Allah) He exonerated Himself, (the Lord of the Worlds!) the Master of the jinn and human beings."
يٰمُوسَىٰ إِنَّهُ أَنَا ٱللَّهُ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ,"(O Moses! Lo! it is I) Who is calling you, (Allah, the Mighty) in retribution against those who do not believe in Me, (the Wise) in My command and judgement, I command that none should be worshipped besides Me."
وَأَلْقِ عَصَاكَ فَلَمَّا رَآهَا تَهْتَزُّ كَأَنَّهَا جَآنٌّ وَلَّىٰ مُدْبِراً وَلَمْ يُعَقِّبْ يٰمُوسَىٰ لاَ تَخَفْ إِنِّي لاَ يَخَافُ لَدَيَّ ٱلْمُرْسَلُونَ,"(And throw down thy staff) from your hand! And he threw it, (But when he saw it writhing) moving (as it were a demon) like a serpent which is neither big nor small, (he turned to flee headlong) from it and did not look back out of fear; but Allah said to him: (O Moses! Fear not! Lo! the emissaries fear not in My presence,"
إِلاَّ مَن ظَلَمَ ثُمَّ بَدَّلَ حُسْناً بَعْدَ سُوۤءٍ فَإِنِّي غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"Save him who hath done wrong and afterward hath changed evil for good. And lo! I am Forgiving) I forgive the one who repents, (Merciful) I show mercy towards he who dies in a state of repentance."
وَأَدْخِلْ يَدَكَ فِي جَيْبِكَ تَخْرُجْ بَيْضَآءَ مِنْ غَيْرِ سُوۤءٍ فِي تِسْعِ آيَاتٍ إِلَىٰ فِرْعَوْنَ وَقَوْمِهِ إِنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ قَوْماً فَاسِقِينَ,"(And put thy hand into the bosom of thy robe) in your armpit, (it will come forth white but unhurt) without having contracted leprosy. Go! ((This will be one) among nine tokens) go with nine signs (unto Pharaoh and his people) the Copts. (Lo! they were ever evil-living folk) they were disbelievers."
فَلَمَّا جَآءَتْهُمْ آيَاتُنَا مُبْصِرَةً قَالُواْ هَـٰذَا سِحْرٌ مُّبِينٌ,"(But when Our tokens came unto them) when Moses went with our tokens to them, (plain to see) demonstrating, one after the other, (they said: This is mere magic) what you have brought us, O Moses, is a manifest lie,"
وَجَحَدُواْ بِهَا وَٱسْتَيْقَنَتْهَآ أَنفُسُهُمْ ظُلْماً وَعُلُوّاً فَٱنْظُرْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَاقِبَةُ ٱلْمُفْسِدِينَ,"(And they denied them) they denied the tokens, (though their souls acknowledged them) after being accepted by their souls that they were from Allah, (for spite) out of opposition and enmity (and arrogance) and haughtiness and pride. (Then see) O Muhammad (the nature of the consequence for the wrong-doers) how was the end result of the idolaters, Pharaoh and his people, how We destroyed them in the sea!"
وَلَقَدْ آتَيْنَا دَاوُودَ وَسُلَيْمَانَ عِلْماً وَقَالاَ ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ ٱلَّذِي فَضَّلَنَا عَلَىٰ كَثِيرٍ مِّنْ عِبَادِهِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,"(And We verily gave knowledge) and understanding through prophethood and judgeship (unto David) the son of Jesse (and Solomon) the son of David, (and they said) both of them: (Praise be to Allah) thanks and gratitude to Allah, (Who hath preferred us) through knowledge and prophethood (above many of His believing slaves!"
وَوَرِثَ سُلَيْمَانُ دَاوُودَ وَقَالَ يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّاسُ عُلِّمْنَا مَنطِقَ ٱلطَّيْرِ وَأُوتِينَا مِن كُلِّ شَيْءٍ إِنَّ هَـٰذَا لَهُوَ ٱلْفَضْلُ ٱلْمُبِينُ,"And Solomon was David's heir) as king instead of all the other sons of David who were 19 in number. (And he said) Solomon said: (O mankind! Lo! we have been taught) we were given the understanding of (the language of birds, and have been given (abundance) of all things) and we were given the knowledge of everything in my kingdom. (This surely is evident favour) this is surely a great blessing from Allah."
وَحُشِرَ لِسْلَيْمَانَ جُنُودُهُ مِنَ ٱلْجِنِّ وَٱلإِنْس وَٱلطَّيْرِ فَهُمْ يُوزَعُونَ,"(And there were gathered together) and made subservient (unto Solomon his armies of the jinn and humankind, and of the birds, and they were set in battle order) they were all retained from the first to the last until they were gathered together;"
حَتَّىٰ إِذَآ أَتَوْا عَلَىٰ وَادِ ٱلنَّمْلِ قَالَتْ نَمْلَةٌ يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّمْلُ ٱدْخُلُواْ مَسَاكِنَكُمْ لاَ يَحْطِمَنَّكُمْ سُلَيْمَانُ وَجُنُودُهُ وَهُمْ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ,"(Till, when they reached the Valley of the Ants) in Historic Syria, (an ant exclaimed: O ants! Enter your dwellings lest Solomon and his armies crush you) step on you, (unperceiving) unaware of you."
فَتَبَسَّمَ ضَاحِكاً مِّن قَوْلِهَا وَقَالَ رَبِّ أَوْزِعْنِيۤ أَنْ أَشْكُرَ نِعْمَتَكَ ٱلَّتِيۤ أَنْعَمْتَ عَلَيَّ وَعَلَىٰ وَالِدَيَّ وَأَنْ أَعْمَلَ صَالِحاً تَرْضَاهُ وَأَدْخِلْنِي بِرَحْمَتِكَ فِي عِبَادِكَ ٱلصَّالِحِينَ,"(And (Solomon) smiled, laughing) in amazement (at her speech) because he heard her speech while his army did not, (and said: My Lord, arouse me) inspire in me (to be thankful for Thy favour wherewith Thou hast favoured me) you have blessed me with the profession of Allah's divine Oneness (and my parents) whom you also blessed with the profession of Allah's divine Oneness, (and to do good) in all sincerity (that shall be pleasing unto Thee) that you would accept (and include me in (the number of) Thy righteous slaves) and include me with Your righteous slaves in Paradise."
وَتَفَقَّدَ ٱلطَّيْرَ فَقَالَ مَالِيَ لاَ أَرَى ٱلْهُدْهُدَ أَمْ كَانَ مِنَ ٱلْغَآئِبِينَ,"(And he sought among the birds) he inspected the birds (and said) when he could not see the hoopoe among them: (How is it that I see not the hoopoe) in his place, (or is he among the absent?)"
لأُعَذِّبَنَّهُ عَذَاباً شَدِيداً أَوْ لأَاْذبَحَنَّهُ أَوْ لَيَأْتِيَنِّي بِسُلْطَانٍ مُّبِينٍ,"He said: if he is among the absent, then (I verily will punish him with hard punishment) I will pluck out his feathers; such was the punishment of the birds, (or I verily will slay him, or he verily shall bring me a plain excuse) an acceptable excuse."
فَمَكَثَ غَيْرَ بَعِيدٍ فَقَالَ أَحَطتُ بِمَا لَمْ تُحِطْ بِهِ وَجِئْتُكَ مِن سَبَإٍ بِنَبَإٍ يَقِينٍ,"(But he was not long in coming, and he said: I have found out (a thing) that thou apprehendest not) O king! I reached a place that you have not reached and have come to know that which you do not, (and I come unto thee from Sheba) the city of Sheba (with sure tidings) with an amazing, true information."
إِنِّي وَجَدتُّ ٱمْرَأَةً تَمْلِكُهُمْ وَأُوتِيَتْ مِن كُلِّ شَيْءٍ وَلَهَا عَرْشٌ عَظِيمٌ,"(Lo! I found a woman ruling over them) whose name is Balqis, (and she hath been given (abundance) of all things) she has been given the knowledge of all things in her country, (and hers is a mighty throne) adorned with gems, pearls, gold and silver."
وَجَدتُّهَا وَقَوْمَهَا يَسْجُدُونَ لِلشَّمْسِ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ وَزَيَّنَ لَهُمُ ٱلشَّيْطَانُ أَعْمَالَهُمْ فَصَدَّهُمْ عَنِ ٱلسَّبِيلِ فَهُمْ لاَ يَهْتَدُونَ,"(I found her and her people worshipping the sun instead of Allah; and Satan maketh their works) their worship of the sun (fair-seeming unto them, and debarreth them from the way (of Truth)) the devil has barred them from the way of Truth and guidance, (so that they go not aright) to the way of truth and guidance:"
أَلاَّ يَسْجُدُواْ للَّهِ ٱلَّذِي يُخْرِجُ ٱلْخَبْءَ فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا تُخْفُونَ وَمَا تُعْلِنُونَ,"(So that they worship not Allah) and I said to them: “O you, prostrate to Allah” it is also said that it is Solomon who said: “why do they not prostrate to Allah?” (Who bringeth forth the hidden in the heavens) the rain (and the earth) vegetation, (and knoweth what ye hide) of good and evil (and what ye proclaim) of good and evil,"
ٱللَّهُ لاَ إِلَـٰهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ رَبُّ ٱلْعَرْشِ ٱلْعَظِيمِ,"(Allah; there is no God save Him, the Lord of the tremendous Throne."
قَالَ سَنَنظُرُ أَصَدَقْتَ أَمْ كُنتَ مِنَ ٱلْكَاذِبِينَ,(Solomon) said) to the hoopoe: (We shall see whether thou speakest truth or whether thou art of the liars.

قَالَتْ يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلْمَلأُ إِنِّيۤ أُلْقِيَ إِلَيَّ كِتَابٌ كَرِيمٌ,"He did as Solomon commanded, and Balqis took the letter and went to meet her entourage. ((The Queen of Sheba) said: O chieftains! Lo! there hath been thrown unto me a noble letter) a sealed letter."
إِنَّهُ مِن سُلَيْمَانَ وَإِنَّهُ بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَـٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ,"(Lo! it is from Solomon, and lo! it is) the first line of it is: (In the name of Allah the Beneficent, the Merciful;"
أَلاَّ تَعْلُواْ عَلَيَّ وَأْتُونِي مُسْلِمِينَ,"Exalt not yourselves against me) feel not too haughty towards me, (but come unto me as those who surrender) and seek peace; as well as demanding other things which were mentioned in the letter."
قَالَتْ يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلْمَلأُ أَفْتُونِي فِيۤ أَمْرِي مَا كُنتُ قَاطِعَةً أَمْراً حَتَّىٰ تَشْهَدُونِ,(She said: O chieftains! Pronounce for me in my case) inform me about what I should do; it is also said that this means: advise me about what to do. (I decide no case) I will not do anything (till ye are present with me) and advise me.
قَالُواْ نَحْنُ أُوْلُو قُوَّةٍ وَأُولُو بَأْسٍ شَدِيدٍ وَٱلأَمْرُ إِلَيْكِ فَٱنظُرِي مَاذَا تَأْمُرِينَ,"(They said: We are lords of might) we have weapons (and lords of great prowess) in war, (but it is for thee to command) we shall follow your command; (so consider what thou wilt command) and we will do it."
قَالَتْ إِنَّ ٱلْمُلُوكَ إِذَا دَخَلُواْ قَرْيَةً أَفْسَدُوهَا وَجَعَلُوۤاْ أَعِزَّةَ أَهْلِهَآ أَذِلَّةً وَكَذٰلِكَ يَفْعَلُونَ,"Then she pronounced words of wisdom. (She said: Lo! Kings) worldly kings, (when they enter a township) by force in instances of war and fighting, (ruin it) destroy it (and make the honour of its people shame) by beating, killing and exposing them to other things. (Thus will they do) Allah said: this is how worldly kings behave because of arrogance."
وَإِنِّي مُرْسِلَةٌ إِلَيْهِمْ بِهَدِيَّةٍ فَنَاظِرَةٌ بِمَ يَرْجِعُ ٱلْمُرْسَلُونَ,"(But lo! I am going to send a present unto them) to Solomon, (and to see with what (answer) the messengers return."
فَلَمَّا جَآءَ سُلَيْمَانَ قَالَ أَتُمِدُّونَنِ بِمَالٍ فَمَآ آتَانِيَ ٱللَّهُ خَيْرٌ مِّمَّآ آتَاكُمْ بَلْ أَنتُمْ بِهَدِيَّتِكُمْ تَفْرَحُونَ,"So when (the envoy) came unto Solomon) when her envoy went to Solomon, ((the King) said: What! Would ye help me with wealth) with a gift? (But that which Allah hath given me) of prophethood and kingship (is better than that which He hath given you) of wealth. (Nay it is ye (and not I) who exult in your gift) if it were to be returned to you."
ٱرْجِعْ إِلَيْهِمْ فَلَنَأْتِيَنَّهُم بِجُنُودٍ لاَّ قِبَلَ لَهُمْ بِهَا وَلَنُخْرِجَنَّهُم مِّنْهَآ أَذِلَّةً وَهُمْ صَاغِرُونَ,"(Return unto them) with their gift. (We verily shall come unto them with hosts) armies (that they cannot resist) which they have no power to stop, (and we shall drive them out from thence) from Sheba (with shame) with their hands tied to their necks, (and they will be abased) humiliated."
قَالَ يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلْمَلأُ أَيُّكُمْ يَأْتِينِي بِعَرْشِهَا قَبْلَ أَن يَأْتُونِي مُسْلِمِينَ,"(He said) Solomon said: (O chiefs! Which of you will bring me her throne before they come unto me, surrendering) and seeking peace?"
قَالَ عِفْرِيتٌ مِّن ٱلْجِنِّ أَنَاْ آتِيكَ بِهِ قَبْلَ أَن تَقُومَ مِن مَّقَامِكَ وَإِنِّي عَلَيْهِ لَقَوِيٌّ أَمِينٌ,"(A) mighty (stalwart of the jinn) called 'Amr (said: I will bring it thee before thou canst rise from your place) before you leave your seat of judgement, for he used to sit for judgements until noon. (Lo! I verily am strong and trusty for such work) even though it is adorned with gems, pearls, gold and silver."
قَالَ ٱلَّذِي عِندَهُ عِلْمٌ مِّنَ ٱلْكِتَابِ أَنَاْ آتِيكَ بِهِ قَبْلَ أَن يَرْتَدَّ إِلَيْكَ طَرْفُكَ فَلَمَّا رَآهُ مُسْتَقِرّاً عِندَهُ قَالَ هَـٰذَا مِن فَضْلِ رَبِّي لِيَبْلُوَنِيۤ أَأَشْكُرُ أَمْ أَكْفُرُ وَمَن شَكَرَ فَإِنَّمَا يَشْكُرُ لِنَفْسِهِ وَمَن كَفَرَ فَإِنَّ رَبِّي غَنِيٌّ كَرِيمٌ,"Solomon said: I want it even quicker than that. (One with whom was knowledge of the Scripture) one who knew Allah's greatest name, O Living, O Subsistent, who was called Asaf Ibn Barkhiyya (said: I will bring it thee before thy gaze returneth unto thee) before that thing which you see from far reaches you. (And when he saw it set in his presence) i.e. when he saw her throne next to his, (Solomon said) to Asaf: (This is of the bounty of my Lord) this is of the favour of my Lord, (that He may try me whether I give thanks) for his blessings (or am ungrateful) or whether I abstain from being grateful for His blessings. (Whosoever giveth thanks) for Allah's blessings (he only giveth thanks for (the good of) his own soul) for the reward of his Lord: (and whosoever is ungrateful) for the blessing of His Lord, he harms only his soul. (For lo! my Lord is Absolute in independence) of his gratitude, (Bountiful) He forgives whoever repents, and He does not hasten his punishment."
قَالَ نَكِّرُواْ لَهَا عَرْشَهَا نَنظُرْ أَتَهْتَدِيۤ أَمْ تَكُونُ مِنَ ٱلَّذِينَ لاَ يَهْتَدُونَ,(He said: Disguise her throne for her) add to her throne and take away from it (that we may see whether she will go aright) whether she will know (or be of those not rightly guided) or whether she will not know.
فَلَمَّا جَآءَتْ قِيلَ أَهَكَذَا عَرْشُكِ قَالَتْ كَأَنَّهُ هُوَ وَأُوتِينَا ٱلْعِلْمَ مِن قَبْلِهَا وَكُنَّا مُسْلِمِينَ,"(So, when she came, it was said (unto her)) Solomon said to her: (Is thy throne like this? She said: (It is) as though it were the very one. And (Solomon said): We were given the knowledge before her) Allah has given me [knowledge], by changing her throne and bringing to me, even before she arrived, (and we had surrendered (to Allah)) and we were sincere before she arrived."
وَصَدَّهَا مَا كَانَت تَّعْبُدُ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ إِنَّهَا كَانَتْ مِن قَوْمٍ كَافِرِينَ,"(And (all) that she was wont to worship) the sun (instead of Allah hindered her) Solomon stopped her; it is also said that this means: Allah stopped her, (for she came of disbelieving folk) her folk were Zoroastrians."
قِيلَ لَهَا ٱدْخُلِي ٱلصَّرْحَ فَلَمَّا رَأَتْهُ حَسِبَتْهُ لُجَّةً وَكَشَفَتْ عَن سَاقَيْهَا قَالَ إِنَّهُ صَرْحٌ مُّمَرَّدٌ مِّن قَوارِيرَ قَالَتْ رَبِّ إِنِّي ظَلَمْتُ نَفْسِي وَأَسْلَمْتُ مَعَ سُلَيْمَانَ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ ٱلْعَالَمِينَ,"(It was said unto her: Enter the hall) enter the castle. (And when she saw it she deemed it a pool and bared her legs) she lifted her dress above her legs. ((Solomon) said: Lo! it is a hall, made smooth, of glass) beneath which there is water, so do not be afraid of getting wet. (She said: My Lord! Lo! I have wronged myself) by worshipping the sun, (and I surrender with Solomon) at the hand of Solomon (unto Allah, the Lord of the Worlds) the master of the jinn and human beings."
وَلَقَدْ أَرْسَلْنَآ إِلَىٰ ثَمُودَ أَخَاهُمْ صَالِحاً أَنِ ٱعْبُدُواْ ٱللَّهَ فَإِذَا هُمْ فَرِيقَانِ يَخْتَصِمُونَ,"(And We verily sent until Thamud their brother) their Prophet (Salih, saying: Worship Allah) that you should say to them: profess Allah's divine Oneness, and repent to Him from disbelief and idolatry. (And lo! they (then) became two parties) one believing and the other disbelieving, (quarrelling) regarding Religion."
قَالَ يٰقَوْمِ لِمَ تَسْتَعْجِلُونَ بِٱلسَّيِّئَةِ قَبْلَ ٱلْحَسَنَةِ لَوْلاَ تَسْتَغْفِرُونَ ٱللَّهَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُرْحَمُونَ,"(He said) Salih said to the disbelieving party: (O my people! Why will ye hasten on the evil) the torment (rather than the good) rather than well-being and mercy? (Why will ye not ask pardon of Allah) why do you not repent of idolatry and denial and profess Allah's divine Oneness, (that ye may receive mercy) and escape the torment."
قَالُواْ ٱطَّيَّرْنَا بِكَ وَبِمَن مَّعَكَ قَالَ طَائِرُكُمْ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ بَلْ أَنتُمْ قَوْمٌ تُفْتَنُونَ,"(They said: We augur evil of thee and those with thee) they meant: the hardship that we face is due to your evil omen and the evil omen of those who believed in you. (He said) Salih said: (Your evil augury) your hardship as well as your comfort (is with Allah) are from Allah. (Nay, but ye are folk that are being tested) by hardship and comfort; it is also said that this means: you are forsaken rather than being given success."
وَكَانَ فِي ٱلْمَدِينَةِ تِسْعَةُ رَهْطٍ يُفْسِدُونَ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَلاَ يُصْلِحُونَ,"(And there were in the city nine persons) nine sinful people among the sons of their chieftains: Qaddar Ibn Salif, Masda' Ibn Dahw and their host (who made mischief in the land) through their transgressions (and reformed not) they did not enjoy righteousness nor practised it."
قَالُواْ تَقَاسَمُواْ بِٱللَّهِ لَنُبَيِّتَنَّهُ وَأَهْلَهُ ثُمَّ لَنَقُولَنَّ لِوَلِيِّهِ مَا شَهِدْنَا مَهْلِكَ أَهْلِهِ وَإِنَّا لَصَادِقُونَ,"(They said: Swear one to another by Allah that we verily will attack him and his household by night) and kill them all, (and afterward we will surely say unto his friend) to his inheritors and relatives: (We witnessed not the destruction of his household) we did not witness the killing of Salih and his household. (And lo! we are truth tellers) they will believe us and no one will reject what we say."
وَمَكَرُواْ مَكْراً وَمَكَرْنَا مَكْراً وَهُمْ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ,"(So they plotted a plot) they planned to kill Salih and all those who believed with him: (and We plotted a plot) and We wanted to kill them, (while they perceived not) Our plotting; it is also said that this means: the angels killed them in the house of Salih by hailing stones at them without them perceiving it."
فَٱنظُرْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَاقِبَةُ مَكْرِهِمْ أَنَّا دَمَّرْنَاهُمْ وَقَوْمَهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ,"(Then see) O Muhammad (the nature of the consequence of their plotting) the punishment for their plan to kill Salih, (for lo! We destroyed them) through raining stones on them (and their people, every one) and We destroyed every one of their people."
فَتِلْكَ بُيُوتُهُمْ خَاوِيَةً بِمَا ظَلَمُوۤاْ إِنَّ فِي ذٰلِكَ لآيَةً لِّقَوْمٍ يَعْلَمُونَ,"(See, yonder are their dwellings empty and in ruins because they did wrong) because of their idolatry. (Lo! Herein) in that which We did to them (is indeed a portent) a sign and an admonition (for a people who have knowledge) who believe in that which was done to them."
وَأَنجَيْنَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَكَانُواْ يَتَّقُونَ,"(And we saved those who believed) in Salih (and used to ward off (evil)) and used to ward off disbelief, idolatry and indecencies."
وَلُوطاً إِذْ قَالَ لِقَوْمِهِ أَتَأْتُونَ ٱلْفَاحِشَةَ وَأَنتُمْ تُبْصِرُونَ,(And Lot!) We sent him to his people (when he said unto his folk: will you commit abomination) sodomy (knowingly) while knowing it to be an abomination?
أَإِنَّكُمْ لَتَأْتُونَ ٱلرِّجَالَ شَهْوَةً مِّن دُونِ ٱلنِّسَآءِ بَلْ أَنتُمْ قَوْمٌ تَجْهَلُونَ,"(Must ye needs lust after men instead of women? Nay, but ye are folk who act senselessly) you are folk who ignore Allah's command."
فَمَا كَانَ جَوَابَ قَوْمِهِ إِلاَّ أَن قَالُوۤاْ أَخْرِجُوۤاْ آلَ لُوطٍ مِّن قَرْيَتِكُمْ إِنَّهمْ أُنَاسٌ يَتَطَهَّرُونَ,"(But the answer of his folk was naught save that they said: Expel the household of Lot) Lot and his two daughters: Za'ura and Raytha (from your township) Sodom, (for they (forsooth) are folk who would keep clean) they exonerate themselves from sodomy!"
فَأَنجَيْنَاهُ وَأَهْلَهُ إِلاَّ ٱمْرَأَتَهُ قَدَّرْنَاهَا مِنَ ٱلْغَابِرِينَ,(Then we saved him and his household) his daughters (save his wife) the hypocrite; (We destined her to be of those who stayed behind) We decreed that she would stay behind to be destroyed.

(Is there any God beside Allah) who did this? (Little do they reflect!) they derive no admonition at all from this."

(Kill him not. Peradventure he may be of use to us) in our farm, (or we may choose him for a son) or adopt him as a son. (And they perceived not) the Children of Israel did not know that he was not from them; it is also said that this means: and they did not know that their destruction will be at his hands."
وَأَصْبَحَ فُؤَادُ أُمِّ مُوسَىٰ فَارِغاً إِن كَادَتْ لَتُبْدِي بِهِ لَوْلاۤ أَن رَّبَطْنَا عَلَىٰ قَلْبِهَا لِتَكُونَ مِنَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,"(And the heart of the mother of Moses) Jochabed (became void) from the preoccupation or mention of anything other than Moses, (and she would have betrayed him) by admitting that Moses was her son after being adopted by Pharaoh (if We had not fortified her heart) with patience, (that she might be of the believers) in the promise of Allah that he will be one of the messengers."
وَقَالَتْ لأُخْتِهِ قُصِّيهِ فَبَصُرَتْ بِهِ عَن جُنُبٍ وَهُمْ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ,"(And she) the mother of Moses (said unto his sister) the sister of Moses whose name was Mary: (Trace him. So she observed him) the child (from afar, and they perceived not) that she is the sister of Moses."
وَحَرَّمْنَا عَلَيْهِ ٱلْمَرَاضِعَ مِن قَبْلُ فَقَالَتْ هَلْ أَدُلُّكُمْ عَلَىٰ أَهْلِ بَيْتٍ يَكْفُلُونَهُ لَكُمْ وَهُمْ لَهُ نَاصِحُونَ,"(And We had before forbidden foster-mothers) the milk of foster-mothers (for him) for Moses, (so she said) the sister of Moses said to the entourage of Pharaoh: (Shall I show you a household who will rear him) Moses (for you and take care of him) and she directed them to her mother?"
فَرَدَدْنَاهُ إِلَىٰ أُمِّهِ كَيْ تَقَرَّ عَيْنُهَا وَلاَ تَحْزَنَ وَلِتَعْلَمَ أَنَّ وَعْدَ ٱللَّهِ حَقٌّ وَلَـٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَهُمْ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ,"(So We restored him to his mother that she might be comforted) by having Moses (and not grieve) over him, (and that she might know that the promise of Allah) to bring him back to her (is true. But most of them) the people of Egypt (know not) this nor believe in it."
وَلَمَّا بَلَغَ أَشُدَّهُ وَٱسْتَوَىٰ آتَيْنَاهُ حُكْماً وَعِلْماً وَكَذَلِكَ نَجْزِي ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,"(And when he reached his full strength) 18 years of age (and was ripe) he reached his 40th year, (We gave him wisdom) understanding (and knowledge) prophethood. (Thus do We reward the good) i.e. the prophets by bestowing upon them understanding and prophethood; it is also said that this means: thus do We reward the righteous by bestowing upon them knowledge and wisdom."
وَدَخَلَ ٱلْمَدِينَةَ عَلَىٰ حِينِ غَفْلَةٍ مِّنْ أَهْلِهَا فَوَجَدَ فِيهَا رَجُلَيْنِ يَقْتَتِلاَنِ هَـٰذَا مِن شِيعَتِهِ وَهَـٰذَا مِنْ عَدُوِّهِ فَٱسْتَغَاثَهُ ٱلَّذِي مِن شِيعَتِهِ عَلَى ٱلَّذِي مِنْ عَدُوِّهِ فَوَكَزَهُ مُوسَىٰ فَقَضَىٰ عَلَيْهِ قَالَ هَـٰذَا مِنْ عَمَلِ ٱلشَّيْطَانِ إِنَّهُ عَدُوٌّ مُّضِلٌّ مُّبِينٌ,"(And he entered the city at a time of carelessness of its folk) when its folk were preoccupied, at the time of the siesta, and it is said after the Maghrib prayer, (and he found therein) in the city (two men fighting, one of his own caste) of the caste of Moses, i.e. an Israelite, (and the other of his enemies) of the enemies of Moses, i.e. a Copt; (and he who was of his caste) Moses' caste (asked him for help against him who was of his enemies) Moses' enemies. (So Moses struck him with his fist and killed him. He said) Moses said: (This is of the devil's doing) by the devil's command. (Lo! he is an enemy, a mere misleaders) whose enmity is quite manifest. And he felt remorse for killing him."
قَالَ رَبِّ إِنِّي ظَلَمْتُ نَفْسِي فَٱغْفِرْ لِي فَغَفَرَ لَهُ إِنَّهُ هُوَ ٱلْغَفُورُ ٱلرَّحِيمُ,"(He said: My Lord! Lo! I have wronged my soul) by killing a person, (so forgive me) my sin. (Then He forgave him. Lo! He is the Forgiving, the Merciful) towards he who repents."
قَالَ رَبِّ بِمَآ أَنْعَمْتَ عَلَيَّ فَلَنْ أَكُونَ ظَهِيراً لِّلْمُجْرِمِينَ,"(He said: My Lord! Forasmuch as Thou hast favoured me) with knowledge and the profession of Your divine Oneness and forgiveness, (I will nevermore be a supporter of the guilty) do not make me a helper to the idolaters: Pharaoh and his host."
فَأَصْبَحَ فِي ٱلْمَدِينَةِ خَآئِفاً يَتَرَقَّبُ فَإِذَا ٱلَّذِي ٱسْتَنْصَرَهُ بِٱلأَمْسِ يَسْتَصْرِخُهُ قَالَ لَهُ مُوسَىٰ إِنَّكَ لَغَوِيٌّ مُّبِينٌ,"(And morning found him in the city, fearing) because of killing the Copt, (vigilant) anticipating arrest, (when behold! he who had appealed to him the day before) to help against the Copt (cried out to him for help) against another Copt. (Moses said unto him) to the Israelite: (Lo! thou art indeed a mere hothead) you are a quarrelsome person, and proceeded to help him."
فَلَمَّآ أَنْ أَرَادَ أَن يَبْطِشَ بِٱلَّذِي هُوَ عَدُوٌّ لَّهُمَا قَالَ يٰمُوسَىٰ أَتُرِيدُ أَن تَقْتُلَنِي كَمَا قَتَلْتَ نَفْساً بِٱلأَمْسِ إِن تُرِيدُ إِلاَّ أَن تَكُونَ جَبَّاراً فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَمَا تُرِيدُ أَن تَكُونَ مِنَ ٱلْمُصْلِحِينَ,"(And when he would have fallen upon the man who was an enemy unto them both) i.e. the Copt, (he said) i.e. the Israelite said: (O Moses! Wouldst thou kill me) today (as thou didst kill a person) a Copt (yesterday. Thou wouldst be nothing but a tyrant) a murderer (in the land) of Egypt, (thou wouldst not be of the reformers) of the pious who enjoin good and forbid evil."
وَجَآءَ رَجُلٌ مِّنْ أَقْصَا ٱلْمَدِينَةِ يَسْعَىٰ قَالَ يٰمُوسَىٰ إِنَّ ٱلْمَلأَ يَأْتَمِرُونَ بِكَ لِيَقْتُلُوكَ فَٱخْرُجْ إِنِّي لَكَ مِنَ ٱلنَّاصِحِينَ,"(And a man) Ezekiel (came from the uttermost part) and it is said from the centre (of the city, running. He said: O Moses! Lo! the chiefs) the family of the man killed (take counsel against thee) they agreed (to slay thee; therefore escape) from the city. (Lo! I am of those who give thee good advice) I am of those who feel pity for you."
فَخَرَجَ مِنْهَا خَآئِفاً يَتَرَقَّبُ قَالَ رَبِّ نَجِّنِي مِنَ ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ,"(So he escaped from thence) from the city, (fearing, vigilant) waiting and looking behind him expecting to be hunted down and arrested. (He said) at this point: (My Lord! Deliver me from the wrong-doing folk) the people of Egypt."
وَلَمَّا تَوَجَّهَ تِلْقَآءَ مَدْيَنَ قَالَ عَسَىٰ رَبِّيۤ أَن يَهْدِيَنِي سَوَآءَ ٱلسَّبِيلِ,"(And when he turned his face towards Midian) he was afraid to miss the way, (he said: Peradventure my Lord will guide me in the right road) leading to Midian."
وَلَمَّا وَرَدَ مَآءَ مَدْيَنَ وَجَدَ عَلَيْهِ أُمَّةً مِّنَ ٱلنَّاسِ يَسْقُونَ وَوَجَدَ مِن دُونِهِمُ ٱمْرَأَتَينِ تَذُودَانِ قَالَ مَا خَطْبُكُمَا قَالَتَا لاَ نَسْقِي حَتَّىٰ يُصْدِرَ ٱلرِّعَآءُ وَأَبُونَا شَيْخٌ كَبِيرٌ,"(And when he came unto the water of Midian) a well in Midian (he found there a whole tribe of men) a group of 40 men, (watering) their flocks. (And he found apart from them two women keeping, back (their flocks)) until the men finished watering their flocks, due to their weakness. (He said: What aileth you) what holds you back? (The two said: We cannot give (our flocks) to drink till the shepherds return from the water) until they finish watering their flocks; (and our father is a very old man) and does not have anyone to help him except us."
فَسَقَىٰ لَهُمَا ثُمَّ تَوَلَّىٰ إِلَى ٱلظِّلِّ فَقَالَ رَبِّ إِنِّي لِمَآ أَنزَلْتَ إِلَيَّ مِنْ خَيْرٍ فَقِيرٌ,"(So he watered (their flock) for them) and they went back to their father to inform him about Moses. (Then he) Moses (turned aside into the shade) of a tree; and it is said: the shade of a wall; and it is said: the shade of a shelter, (and said) Moses said: (My Lord! I am needy of whatever good) food (Thou sendest down for me) You have decreed for me."
فَجَآءَتْهُ إِحْدَاهُمَا تَمْشِي عَلَى ٱسْتِحْيَآءٍ قَالَتْ إِنَّ أَبِي يَدْعُوكَ لِيَجْزِيَكَ أَجْرَ مَا سَقَيْتَ لَنَا فَلَمَّا جَآءَهُ وَقَصَّ عَلَيْهِ ٱلْقَصَصَ قَالَ لاَ تَخَفْ نَجَوْتَ مِنَ ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ,"(Then there came unto him one of the two women) the youngest of the two, whose name was Zipporah (Saffurah), (walking shyly) with her hand on her face. (She said: Lo! my father biddeth thee, that he may reward thee with a payment for that thou didst water (the flock) for us. Then, when he came unto him) when Moses went to Yathron, the nephew of the Prophet Shu'ayb who had died before (and told him) told Yathron (the (whole) story) of his escape from Pharaoh and the rest of it, (he said) Yathron said to him: (Fear not! thou hast escaped from the wrong-doing folk) the people of Egypt."
قَالَتْ إِحْدَاهُمَا يٰأَبَتِ ٱسْتَئْجِرْهُ إِنَّ خَيْرَ مَنِ ٱسْتَئْجَرْتَ ٱلْقَوِيُّ ٱلأَمِينُ,"(One of the two women said) the youngest of the two women said: (O my father! Hire him! For the best (man) that thou canst hire is the strong) who can bear a heavy load, (the trustworthy) regarding that with which you entrust him."
قَالَ إِنِّيۤ أُرِيدُ أَنْ أُنكِحَكَ إِحْدَى ٱبْنَتَيَّ هَاتَيْنِ عَلَىٰ أَن تَأْجُرَنِي ثَمَانِيَ حِجَجٍ فَإِنْ أَتْمَمْتَ عَشْراً فَمِنْ عِندِكَ وَمَآ أُرِيدُ أَنْ أَشُقَّ عَلَيْكَ سَتَجِدُنِي إِن شَاءَ اللَّهُ مِنَ الصَّالِحِينَ,"(He said) Yathron said to Moses: (Lo! I fain would marry thee) O Moses (to one of these two daughters of mine on condition that thou hirest thyself to me) to look after my flock (for (the term of) eight pilgrimages) eight years. (Then if thou completest ten) ten years (it will be of thine own accord) the increase of term will be of your own accord, (for I would not make it hard for thee) by increasing the term. (Allah willing, thou wilt find me of the righteous) who fulfil their promise."
قَالَ ذَلِكَ بَيْنِي وَبَيْنَكَ أَيَّمَا ٱلأَجَلَيْنِ قَضَيْتُ فَلاَ عُدْوَانَ عَلَيَّ وَٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ مَا نَقُولُ وَكِيلٌ,"(He said) Moses said: (That (is settled) between thee and me) I agree to the conditions. (Whichever of the two terms I fulfil) eight or ten years, (there will be no injustice to me) after that you will have no right over me, (and Allah is Surety) Witness (over what we say) over the conditions agreed between us and their fulfilment."
فَلَمَّا قَضَىٰ مُوسَى ٱلأَجَلَ وَسَارَ بِأَهْلِهِ آنَسَ مِن جَانِبِ ٱلطُّورِ نَاراً قَالَ لأَهْلِهِ ٱمْكُثُوۤاْ إِنِّيۤ آنَسْتُ نَاراً لَّعَلِّيۤ آتِيكُمْ مِّنْهَا بِخَبَرٍ أَوْ جَذْوَةٍ مِّنَ ٱلنَّارِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَصْطَلُونَ,"(Then, when Moses had fulfilled the term) ten years, (and was travelling with his housefolk) towards Egypt, (he saw in the distance a fire) he saw on the left side of the road a fire (and said unto his housefolk: Bide ye (here)) remain her. (Lo! I see in the distance a fire; peradventure I shall bring you tidings thence) from the Fire camp, (or a brand from the Fire that ye may warm yourselves) because they were in the cold winter."
فَلَمَّآ أَتَاهَا نُودِيَ مِن شَاطِىءِ ٱلْوَادِي ٱلأَيْمَنِ فِي ٱلْبُقْعَةِ ٱلْمُبَارَكَةِ مِنَ ٱلشَّجَرَةِ أَن يٰمُوسَىٰ إِنِّيۤ أَنَا ٱللَّهُ رَبُّ ٱلْعَالَمِينَ,"(And when he reached it, he was called from the right side of the valley) from the right side of Moses (in the blessed field) blessed with trees and water, (from the tree) from the direction of the tree: (O Moses! Lo! I, even I, am Allah, the Lord of the Worlds) the Lord of the jinn and human beings;"
وَأَنْ أَلْقِ عَصَاكَ فَلَمَّا رَآهَا تَهْتَزُّ كَأَنَّهَا جَآنٌّ وَلَّىٰ مُدْبِراً وَلَمْ يُعَقِّبْ يٰمُوسَىٰ أَقْبِلْ وَلاَ تَخَفْ إِنَّكَ مِنَ ٱلآمِنِينَ,"(Throw down your staff) from your hand. (And when he saw it) after throwing it down (writhing) moving with its head up (as it had been a demon) a serpent neither big nor small, (he turned to flee headlong) from it, without looking back; but Allah said: (O Moses! Draw nigh) to it (and fear not) from it. (Lo! thou art of those who are secure) from its evil. When Moses picked it up, it was a staff like it was originally."
ٱسْلُكْ يَدَكَ فِي جَيْبِكَ تَخْرُجْ بَيْضَآءَ مِنْ غَيْرِ سُوۤءٍ وَٱضْمُمْ إِلَيْكَ جَنَاحَكَ مِنَ ٱلرَّهْبِ فَذَانِكَ بُرْهَانَانِ مِن رَّبِّكَ إِلَىٰ فِرْعَوْنَ وَمَلَئِهِ إِنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ قَوْماً فَاسِقِينَ,"Allah then said to him: (Thrust thy hand into the bosom of thy robe) in your armpit, O Moses, (it will come forth white) shining like the rays of the sun (without hurt) without being afflicted with leprosy. (And guard thy heart) and put back your hand in your armpit after that (from fear) from the difference, if people get scared. (Then these shall be two proofs from your Lord unto Pharaoh and his chiefs: Lo! they are evil-living folk) disbelievers who caused corruption because of their state of idolatry."
قَالَ رَبِّ إِنِّي قَتَلْتُ مِنْهُمْ نَفْساً فَأَخَافُ أَن يَقْتُلُونِ,(He said) Moses said: (My Lord! Lo! I killed a man among them and I fear that they will kill me) in retaliation.
وَأَخِي هَارُونُ هُوَ أَفْصَحُ مِنِّي لِسَاناً فَأَرْسِلْهُ مَعِيَ رِدْءاً يُصَدِّقُنِي إِنِّيۤ أَخَافُ أَن يُكَذِّبُونِ,(My brother Aaron is more eloquent then me in speech) because Moses had a slight speech impediment. (Therefore send him with me as a helper to confirm me) to speak on my behalf and confirm my words. (Lo! I fear that they will give the lie to me) deny the message I bring to them.
قَالَ سَنَشُدُّ عَضُدَكَ بِأَخِيكَ وَنَجْعَلُ لَكُمَا سُلْطَاناً فَلاَ يَصِلُونَ إِلَيْكُمَا بِآيَاتِنَآ أَنتُمَا وَمَنِ ٱتَّبَعَكُمَا ٱلْغَالِبُونَ,"(He said) Allah said: (We will strengthen thine arm with thy brother) Aaron, (and We will give unto you both power) a proof and argument (so that they cannot reach you for Our portents) in order to kill you. (Ye twain, and those who follow you) by believing in you and the signs you bring, (will be the winners) against Pharaoh and his people."
فَلَمَّا جَآءَهُم مُّوسَىٰ بِآيَاتِنَا بَيِّنَاتٍ قَالُواْ مَا هَـٰذَآ إِلاَّ سِحْرٌ مُّفْتَرًى وَمَا سَمِعْنَا بِهَـٰذَا فِيۤ آبَآئِنَا ٱلأَوَّلِينَ,"(But when Moses came unto them with Our clear tokens) the hand and the staff, (they said) O Moses: (This) which you have brought us (is naught but invented magic) a lie which you have invented. (We never heard of this) which you are saying (among our fathers of old) among our deceased forefathers."
وَقَالَ مُوسَىٰ رَبِّيۤ أَعْلَمُ بِمَن جَآءَ بِٱلْهُدَىٰ مِنْ عِندِهِ وَمَن تَكُونُ لَهُ عَاقِبَةُ ٱلدَّارِ إِنَّهُ لاَ يُفْلِحُ ٱلظَّالِمُونَ,"(And Moses said: My Lord is best aware of him who bringeth guidance) who brings the message and the call for the profession of Allah's divine Oneness (from His presence, and whose will be the sequel of the Home (of bliss)) Paradise in the Hereafter.

وَقَالَ فِرْعَوْنُ يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلْملأُ مَا عَلِمْتُ لَكُمْ مِّنْ إِلَـٰهٍ غَيْرِي فَأَوْقِدْ لِي يٰهَامَانُ عَلَى ٱلطِّينِ فَٱجْعَل لِّي صَرْحاً لَّعَلِّيۤ أَطَّلِعُ إِلَىٰ إِلَـٰهِ مُوسَىٰ وَإِنِّي لأَظُنُّهُ مِنَ ٱلْكَاذِبِينَ,"(And Pharaoh said: O chiefs) O men of Egypt! (I know not that ye have a god other than me) therefore do not obey Moses, (so kindle for me (a fire), O Haman, to bake the mud; and set up for me a lofty tower in order that I may survey) I may climb up to (the God of Moses) whom he claims is in heaven and send him to me; (and lo! I deem him of the liars) there is no god in heaven."

فَأَخَذْنَاهُ وَجُنُودَهُ فَنَبَذْنَاهُمْ فِي ٱلْيَمِّ فَٱنظُرْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَاقِبَةُ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ,"(Therefore We seized him) i.e. Pharaoh, because of what he said initially, “I am your exalted lord”, and his other claim: “I know not that you have a god other than me” (and his hosts) the Coptic people, (and abandoned them unto the sea) and cast them in the sea. (Behold) O Muhammad (the nature of the consequence for evil-doers) how was the end of the idolaters: Pharaoh and his host!"
وَجَعَلْنَاهُمْ أَئِمَّةً يَدْعُونَ إِلَى ٱلنَّارِ وَيَوْمَ ٱلْقِيامَةِ لاَ يُنصَرُونَ,"(And We made them patterns) We forsook them (that invite unto) they were leaders to disbelief and error to (the Fire) to disbelief, idolatry and the worship of idols, (and on the Day of Resurrection they will not be helped) they will not be saved from the Fire."
وَأَتْبَعْنَاهُم فِي هَذِهِ ٱلدُّنْيَا لَعْنَةً وَيَوْمَ القِيَامَةِ هُمْ مِّنَ ٱلْمَقْبُوحِينَ,"(And We made a curse to follow them in this world) We destroyed them in this worldly life by drowning, (and on the Day of Resurrection they will be among the hateful) they will have gloomy faces and bluish eyes."
وَلَقَدْ آتَيْنَا مُوسَى ٱلْكِتَابَ مِن بَعْدِ مَآ أَهْلَكْنَا ٱلْقُرُونَ ٱلأُولَىٰ بَصَآئِرَ لِلنَّاسِ وَهُدًى وَرَحْمَةً لَّعَلَّهُمْ يَتَذَكَّرُونَ,"(And We verily gave the Scripture) i.e. the Torah (unto Moses after We had destroyed the generations of old) before Moses; (clear testimonies) a clarification (for mankind) for the Children of Israel, (and a guidance) from error (and a mercy) for those who believe in it, (that haply they might reflect) in order that they make take admonition and believe in it."
وَمَا كُنتَ بِجَانِبِ ٱلْغَرْبِيِّ إِذْ قَضَيْنَآ إِلَىٰ مُوسَى ٱلأَمْرَ وَمَا كنتَ مِنَ ٱلشَّاهِدِينَ,"(And thou) O Muhammad (wast not on the western side (of the Mount) when We exposited unto Moses the commandment) when We commanded Moses to go to Pharaoh, (and thou wast not among those present) there;"

(Did they not) i.e. the disbelievers of Mecca (disbelieve in that which was given unto Moses of old) i.e. the Torah before the coming of Muhammad (pbuh)? (They say) the disbelievers of Mecca say: (Two magics) i.e. the Qur'an and the Torah (that support each other; and they) the disbelievers of Mecca (say: Lo! in both we are disbelievers) we disbelieve in both the Qur'an and the Torah."
قُلْ فَأْتُواْ بِكِتَابٍ مِّنْ عِندِ ٱللَّهِ هُوَ أَهْدَىٰ مِنْهُمَآ أَتَّبِعْهُ إِن كُنتُمْ صَادِقِينَ,"(Say) to them, O Muhammad: (Then bring a Scripture from the presence of Allah that giveth clearer guidance) more sound (than these two) the Qur'an and the Torah ((that) I may follow it) that I may act according to it, (if ye are truthful) that the Qur'an and Torah are two magics that support each other."
فَإِن لَّمْ يَسْتَجِيبُواْ لَكَ فَٱعْلَمْ أَنَّمَا يَتَّبِعُونَ أَهْوَآءَهُمْ وَمَنْ أَضَلُّ مِمَّنِ ٱتَّبَعَ هَوَاهُ بِغَيْرِ هُدًى مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لاَ يَهْدِي ٱلْقَوْمَ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ,"When they could not bring a Scripture, Allah said: (And if they answer thee not) if the wrong-doers do not produce that which you have asked them, (then know that what they follow is their lusts) through disbelief, idolatry and idol worship. (And who goeth farther astray) from the Truth and guidance (than he who followeth his lust) through disbelief, idolatry, and idol worship (without guidance from Allah) without proof or exposition from Allah. (Lo! Allah guideth not) to His religion (wrong-doing folk) the idolaters: Abu Jahl and his host."
وَلَقَدْ وَصَّلْنَا لَهُمُ ٱلْقَوْلَ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَذَكَّرُونَ,"(And now verily We have caused the Word to reach them) We explained to them the Qur'an and its message of divine Oneness, (that haply they may give heed) so that they may take admonition from the Qur'an and believe in it."

وَإِذَا يُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْهِمْ قَالُوۤاْ آمَنَّا بِهِ إِنَّهُ ٱلْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّنَآ إنَّا كُنَّا مِن قَبْلِهِ مُسْلِمِينَ,(And when it is recited unto them) and when the Qur'an is recited to them expositing the attributes and description of Muhammad (pbuh) (they say: We believe in it) we believe in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an. (Lo! it is the Truth from our Lord. Lo! even before it) before the recitation of the Qur'an to us (we were of those who surrender (unto Him)) we were of those who believe in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an.

(Peace be unto you!) May Allah guide you! (We desire not the ignorant) we do not seek the religion of those who associate partners with Allah."

(Have We not established for them) We made them dwell in (a sure sanctuary) free of turmoil, (whereunto the produce of all things is brought (in trade), a provision from Our presence?) A sustenance for them from Us, so how am I to set the disbelievers on them if they were to believe? (But most of them know not) this nor believe in it."

(And never did We destroy the townships) the inhabitants of any township (unless the folk thereof were evil-doers) idolaters."

(Have ye then no sense?) do you not possess sound thinking to realise that this worldly life is perishing while the Hereafter is lasting?"
أَفَمَن وَعَدْنَاهُ وَعْداً حَسَناً فَهُوَ لاَقِيهِ كَمَن مَّتَّعْنَاهُ مَتَاعَ ٱلْحَيَاةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا ثُمَّ هُوَ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ مِنَ ٱلْمُحْضَرِينَ,"(Is he whom We have promised a fair promise) Paradise; the reference here is to Muhammad (pbuh) and his Companions; it is also said that the reference is to 'Uthman Ibn 'Affan (which he will find (true)) in the Hereafter (like him whom We suffer to enjoy awhile the comfort of the life of the world) like him whom We gave wealth and servants in the life of the world; the reference here is to Abu Jahl, (then on the Day of Resurrection he will be of those arraigned) of those who are tormented in hell?"

الۤـمۤ,"And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said regarding the interpretation of Allah's saying (Alif. Lam. Mim.): '(Alif. Lam. Mim.) He says: I am Allah, I know; it is also said that it is an oath by which Allah swore because of His saying: (Lo! We tested those who were before you)."

(Lo! worship preserveth from lewdness) transgressions (and iniquity) that which is unknown in the Shari'ah or Sunnah; as long as one performs the prayers, they will prevent one from lewdness and iniquity, (but verily remembrance of Allah is more important) He says: Allah's remembrance of you, through His forgiveness and reward, is greater than your remembrance of Him during the prayer. (And Allah knoweth what ye do) whether it is good or evil."

(Lo! Herein) i.e. in the Qur'an (verily is mercy) that saves from chastisement, for those who believe in it, (and a reminder) an admonition (for folk who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an."

(We have now seen) we know now that which we did not (and heard) and become certain about that which we were not certain of, (so send us back) so that we believe in You; (we will do right) sincerely to You, (now we are sure) we believe in You, in Your Book, Messenger and in resurrection after death."
وَلَوْ شِئْنَا لآتَيْنَا كُلَّ نَفْسٍ هُدَاهَا وَلَـٰكِنْ حَقَّ ٱلْقَوْلُ مِنِّي لأَمْلأَنَّ جَهَنَّمَ مِنَ ٱلْجِنَّةِ وَٱلنَّاسِ أَجْمَعِينَ,"(And if We had so willed, We could have given every soul its guidance) its God-fearingness, (but the word from Me concerning evil-doers took effect) My word decreed (that I will fill hell with the jinn and mankind together) with the disbelievers among the jinn and mankind. Had it not been for this, I would have honoured every single soul with knowledge and the confession of Allah's divine Oneness."
فَذُوقُواْ بِمَا نَسِيتُمْ لِقَآءَ يَوْمِكُمْ هَـٰذَآ إِنَّا نَسِينَاكُمْ وَذُوقُـواْ عَذَابَ ٱلْخُلْدِ بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ,"(So taste (the evil of your deeds). Forasmuch as ye forgot) the belief in and work for (the meeting of this your day, lo! We forget you) We leave you in the Fire. (Taste the doom immortality) the eternal torment (because of what ye used to do) in your state of disbelief."
إِنَّمَا يُؤْمِنُ بِآيَاتِنَا ٱلَّذِينَ إِذَا ذُكِّرُواْ بِهَا خَرُّواْ سُجَّداً وَسَبَّحُواْ بِحَمْدِ رَبِّهِمْ وَهُمْ لاَ يَسْتَكْبِرُونَ,"(Only those believe in Our revelations) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an (who, when they are reminded of them) invited through them to perform the five daily prayers with the call to prayer and the call announcing the start of the prayer, (fall down prostrate) they come in all humility (and hymn the praise of their Lord) and pray by the command of their Lord, (and they are not scornful) they are not too proud to believe in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an or too proud to pray in congregation. This verse was revealed about the hypocrites who were sluggish in their coming to the congregational prayer."
تَتَجَافَىٰ جُنُوبُهُمْ عَنِ ٱلْمَضَاجِعِ يَدْعُونَ رَبَّهُمْ خَوْفاً وَطَمَعاً وَمِمَّا رَزَقْنَاهُمْ يُنفِقُونَ,"(Who forsake their beds) after sleeping a little at night (to cry unto their Lord) to worship their Lord by means of the five daily prayers; it is also said that they forsake their beds in order to pray the last night prayer ('Isha'); it is also said that this means: they leave their beds after sleeping a little at night to perform supererogatory prayers (in fear) of Him and His chastisement (and hope) in Him and His mercy, (and spend) in charity (of what we have bestowed on them) of wealth."
فَلاَ تَعْلَمُ نَفْسٌ مَّآ أُخْفِيَ لَهُم مِّن قُرَّةِ أَعْيُنٍ جَزَآءً بِمَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ,"(No soul knoweth what is kept hid for them) what is prepared and stored for them (of joy) of gladness of the soul, reward and honour in Paradise, (as a reward for what they used to do) in the life of this world of good works."
أَفَمَن كَانَ مُؤْمِناً كَمَن كَانَ فَاسِقاً لاَّ يَسْتَوُونَ,"(Is he who is a believer) a sincere believer; the reference here is to 'Ali Ibn Abi Talib (like unto him who is an evil-liver?) I.e. a hypocrite; the reference here is to al-Walid Ibn 'Uqbah Ibn Abi Ma'it. (They are not alike) in the life of this world in relation to their obedience nor are they alike in the Hereafter in relation to the reward and honour bestowed by Allah. This is because these two had an argument and exchanged words until 'Ali Ibn Abi Talib, may Allah be well pleased with him, said to him: "" O sinner! ""."
أَمَّا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ فَلَهُمْ جَنَّاتُ ٱلْمَأْوَىٰ نُزُلاً بِمَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ,"Allah then explained the destination of both of them after they die, saying: (But as for those who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an (and do good works) between them and their Lord, (for them are the Gardens of Retreat) as a reward for them in the Hereafter, (a welcome (in reward) for what they used to do) of good works in the life of this world."
وَأَمَّا ٱلَّذِينَ فَسَقُواْ فَمَأْوَاهُمُ ٱلنَّارُ كُلَّمَآ أَرَادُوۤاْ أَن يَخْرُجُواُ مِنْهَآ أُعِيدُواْ فِيهَا وَقِيلَ لَهُمْ ذُوقُواْ عَذَابَ ٱلنَّارِ ٱلَّذِي كُنتُمْ بِهِ تُكَذِّبُونَ,"(And as for those who do evil) and as for those who were hypocrites in the life of this world, (their retreat is the Fire) as a final destination. (Whenever they desire to issue forth from thence) from the Fire, (they are brought back thither) to the Fire in shackles of iron. (Unto them it is said) the angels of the Fire say to them: (Taste the torment of the Fire which ye used to deny) in the life of the world."
وَلَنُذِيقَنَّهُمْ مِّنَ ٱلْعَذَابِ ٱلأَدْنَىٰ دُونَ ٱلْعَذَابِ ٱلأَكْبَرِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ,"(And verily We make them taste) We will inflict on them, i.e. on the people of Mecca (the lower punishment) the punishment of the life of this world: dryness of the land, drought, hunger, assassination, etc; it is also said that this refers to the torment of the grave (before the greater) before the torment of the Fire; this is a warning to them, (that haply they may return) from their disbelief and accept faith."
وَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّن ذُكِّرَ بِآيَاتِ رَبِّهِ ثُمَّ أَعْرَضَ عَنْهَآ إِنَّا مِنَ ٱلْمُجْرِمِينَ مُنتَقِمُونَ,"(And who doth greater wrong) no one is more insolent and iniquitous (than he who is reminded of) admonished by (the revelations of his Lord) this was revealed about the hypocrites and the deriders of the Qur'an, (then turneth from them) in denial. (Lo! We shall requite) We will chastise (the guilty) the idolaters."
وَلَقَدْ آتَيْنَا مُوسَى ٱلْكِتَابَ فَلاَ تَكُن فِي مِرْيَةٍ مِّن لِّقَآئِهِ وَجَعَلْنَاهُ هُدًى لِّبَنِيۤ إِسْرَائِيلَ,(We verily gave Moses the Scripture) the Torah in one bulk; (so be not ye) O Muhammad (in doubt of his receiving it) of meeting Moses the night you were transported to Jerusalem; (and We appointed it) the Scripture of Moses (a guidance for the Children of Israel) from guidance.
وَجَعَلْنَا مِنْهُمْ أَئِمَّةً يَهْدُونَ بِأَمْرِنَا لَمَّا صَبَرُواْ وَكَانُواْ بِآيَاتِنَا يُوقِنُونَ,"(And when they became steadfast) in their faith in and obedience of Me (and believed firmly) believed from their Scripture (in Our revelations) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an, (We appointed from among them) from among the children of Israel (leaders) of goodness (who guided by Our command) who invite people to Our command."
إِنَّ رَبَّكَ هُوَ يَفْصِلُ بَيْنَهُمْ يَوْمَ ٱلْقَيَامَةِ فِيمَا كَانُواْ فِيهِ يَخْتَلِفُونَ,(Lo! thy Lord) O Muhammad (will judge between them) between the believer and disbeliever; it is also said: between the Children of Israel (on the Day of Resurrection concerning that wherein) in Religion (they used to differ) they used to oppose.
أَوَلَمْ يَهْدِ لَهُمْ كَمْ أَهْلَكْنَا مِن قَبْلِهِمْ مِّنَ ٱلْقُرُونِ يَمْشُونَ فِي مَسَاكِنِهِمْ إِنَّ فِي ذَلِكَ لآيَاتٍ أَفَلاَ يَسْمَعُونَ,"(Is it not a guidance for them (to observe)) has not been explained to the disbelievers of Mecca (how many generations He destroyed before them) through His chastisement, (amid whose dwelling places they do walk) they walk amid the dwellings of the people of Shu'ayb, Salih and Hud? (Lo, therein) in that which We have done to them (verily are portents) signs and lessons for those who came after them! (Will they not then heed) will they not obey He Who did this to them?"
أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْاْ أَنَّا نَسُوقُ ٱلْمَآءَ إِلَى ٱلأَرْضِ ٱلْجُرُزِ فَنُخْرِجُ بِهِ زَرْعاً تَأْكُلُ مِنْهُ أَنْعَامُهُمْ وَأَنفُسُهُمْ أَفَلاَ يُبْصِرُونَ,"(Have they not seen) do the people of Mecca not know (how We lead the water to the barren land) wherein there is no vegetation (and therewith) with the water (bring forth crops whereof) from the grass (their cattle eat, and they themselves) eat from the grains, fruits and legumes? (Will they not then see) do they not know it is from Allah?"
وَيَقُولُونَ مَتَىٰ هَـٰذَا ٱلْفَتْحُ إِن كُنتُمْ صَادِقِينَ,(And they say) i.e. Banu Khuzaymah and Banu Kinanah say: (When cometh this victory (of yours)) the conquest of Mecca (if ye are truthful) that it will be conquered? They asked this question to mock the believers.
قُلْ يَوْمَ ٱلْفَتْحِ لاَ يَنفَعُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوۤاْ إِيَمَانُهُمْ وَلاَ هُمْ يُنظَرُونَ,"(Say) O Muhammad to Banu Khuzaymah and Banu Kinanah: (On the day of the victory) of the conquest of Mecca (the faith of those who disbelieve) i.e. Banu Khuzaymah ((and who then will believe) will not avail them) from being killed, (neither will they be reprieved) from being sentenced to death."
فَأَعْرِضْ عَنْهُمْ وَٱنتَظِرْ إِنَّهُمْ مُّنتَظِرُونَ,"(So withdraw from them (O Muhammad)) from Banu Khuzaymah and do not preoccupy yourself with them, (and await (the event)) await their destruction on the day of the conquest of Mecca. (Lo! they also are awaiting (it)) they are also awaiting their destruction. And Allah did indeed destroy them upon the conquest of Mecca'."
يَٰأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّبِيُّ ٱتَّقِ ٱللَّهَ وَلاَ تُطِعِ ٱلْكَافِرِينَ وَٱلْمُنَافِقِينَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ عَلِيماً حَكِيماً,"And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said regarding the interpretation of Allah's saying (O Prophet! Keep thy duty to Allah): '(O Prophet! Keep thy duty to Allah) He says: fear Allah in relation to breaking your pledge before the time of its expiry (and obey not the disbelievers) from among the people Mecca: Abu Sufyan Ibn Harb, 'Ikrimah Ibn Abi Jahl and Abu'l-A'war al-Aslami (and the hypocrites) of Medina: 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy Ibn Salul, Mu'attib Ibn Qushayr and Jadd Ibn Qays; do not obey them in what they ask you to commit of transgression. (Lo! Allah is Knower) of what they say and of their intent to kill you, (Wise) He enjoined that one should honour one's pledge and forbade breaking pledges."
وَٱتَّبِعْ مَا يُوحَىٰ إِلَـيْكَ مِن رَبِّكَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيراً,(And follow) O Muhammad (that which is inspired in thee from your Lord) act according to what you have been commanded in the Qur'an. (Lo! Allah is Aware of what ye do) whether you honour your pledge or break it.
وَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَىٰ ٱللَّهِ وَكَفَىٰ بِٱللَّهِ وَكِيلاً,"(And put thy trust in Allah, for Allah is Sufficient as Trustee) He is sufficient to fulfil His promise to you: to give you victory and the upper hand; it is also said that this means: He is sufficient to protect you from them."
مَّا جَعَلَ ٱللَّهُ لِرَجُلٍ مِّن قَلْبَيْنِ فِي جَوْفِهِ وَمَا جَعَلَ أَزْوَاجَكُمُ ٱللاَّئِي تُظَاهِرُونَ مِنْهُنَّ أُمَّهَاتِكُمْ وَمَا جَعَلَ أَدْعِيَآءَكُمْ أَبْنَآءَكُمْ ذَٰلِكُمْ قَوْلُكُم بِأَفْوَاهِكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ يَقُولُ ٱلْحَقَّ وَهُوَ يَهْدِي ٱلسَّبِيلَ,"(Allah hath not assigned unto any man two hearts within his body) this was revealed about Abu Ma'mar Jamil Ibn Asad who was called “the one with two hearts” because of his measured speech, (nor hath He made your wives whom ye declare (to be your mothers)) by a simple oath ((to be your mothers) your mothers) as your mother in relation to unmarriageability-this was revealed about Aws Ibn al-Samit the brother of 'Ubadah Ibn al-Samit and his wife Khawlah-, (nor hath he made those whom ye claim (to be your sons)) those whom you adopted in order to help and strengthen you (your sons) like your real sons. (This is but a saying of your mouths) between yourselves. (But Allah saith the Truth) Allah explains the Truth (and He showeth the way) and lead to what is right."

(That will be more equitable) better, more correct and fairer (in the sight of Allah) in relation to lineage. (And if ye know not their fathers) if you do not know the lineage of their fathers, (then (they are) your brethren in the faith) name them with names showing brotherhood in faith: 'Abdullah, 'Abd al-Rahman, 'Abd al-Rahim and 'Abd al-Raziq, (and your clients) and name them as your clients. (And there is no sin for you in the mistakes that ye make unintentionally) regarding the identification of one's parentage, (but what your hearts purpose (that will be a sin for you)) what is a sin for you is to attribute intentionally someone to other than his real father. (Allah is Forgiving) of what was done in the past, (Merciful) in relation to what will happen in the future. This verse was revealed about Zayd Ibn Harithah who was adopted by the Prophet (pbuh). People used to call him Zayd Ibn Muhammad, but Allah forbade them from calling him so and guided them to what is proper."

(And the owners of kinship) those related with ties of kinship (are closer one to another) have more right to one another in relation to inheritance (in the ordinance of Allah) thus it is written in the Guarded Tablet; and it is said: thus it is written in the Torah; and it is said: thus it is written in the Qur'an (than (other) believers and the fugitives (who fled from Mecca) except that ye should do kindness) a bequest not exceeding a third of the whole inheritance (to your friends) your custodians in religion or your friends. (This) inheritance for relatives and bequests for friends or clients (is written in the Book) in the Guarded Tablet; it is also said: it is written in the Torah and the Children of Israel practise it."

(We took from them a solemn covenant) that they should convey the message, the first to the last and that the last should believe in the first, and also command their respective people to believe in it;"

Enter not the dwellings of the Prophet for a meal) this verse was revealed concerning a group of believers who used to enter the rooms of the Prophet (pbuh) in the morning and evening and wait for the food to be served. They used to eat and speak with the wives of the Prophet (pbuh). The Prophet (pbuh) did not like this but felt shy of these believers and could not tell them to stop coming to his rooms without permission, or ask them to leave once they were inside. But Allah forbade them from this, saying: O believers, do not enter the rooms of the Prophet (pbuh) without permission from the Prophet to come and eat (without waiting for the proper time) for the food to be ready, (unless permission be granted you) to come in. (But if ye are invited, enter, and, when, your meal is ended) when you have finished eating, (then disperse) then leave. (Linger not for conversation) with the wives of the Prophet (pbuh). (Lo! That) coming in, sitting down and having conversation with the wives of the Prophet (pbuh) (would cause annoyance to the Prophet) Allah bless him and give him peace, (and he would be shy of (asking) you (to go)) or not to come in the first place; (but Allah is not shy of the Truth) Allah is not shy to command you to leave and not go in his rooms without his permission. (And when ye ask of them (the wives of the Prophet) anything) and when you speak with them, (ask it of them) speak with them (from behind a curtain. That is purer for your hearts and for their hearts) i.e. from doubts. (And it is not for you to cause annoyance to the Messenger of Allah) by entering his rooms without his permission and conversing with his wives, (nor that ye should ever marry his wives after him) after his death. This verse was revealed about Talhah Ibn 'Ubaydullah who had in mind to marry 'A'ishah after the death of the Prophet (pbuh). (Lo! That) your open declaration and intention to marry the Prophet's wives after his death (in Allah's sight would be an enormity) it is an enormous sin which merits severe punishment."

(O women! Keep your duty to Allah) fear Allah about all these in relation to their entering in on you and their conversation with you. (Lo! Allah is Witness over all things) relating to your works."

Allah commanded them to cease their harm and they complied."

فَأَعْرَضُواْ فَأَرْسَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ سَيْلَ ٱلْعَرِمِ وَبَدَّلْنَاهُمْ بِجَنَّتَيْهِمْ جَنَّتَيْنِ ذَوَاتَيْ أُكُلٍ خَمْطٍ وَأَثْلٍ وَشَيْءٍ مِّن سِدْرٍ قَلِيلٍ,"(But they were froward) they turned away from faith and acceptance of the messengers and failed to give thanks, (so We sent on them the flood of 'Iram) the flood of a river which destroyed their gardens, houses and all their bounties. 'Iram was the name of a river in Yemen within which they built a dam. This dam had three superimposed openings, Allah destroyed the dam and destroyed them by means of its water, (and in exchange for their two gardens) which were destroyed (gave them two gardens bearing bitter fruit, the tamarisk and here and there a lote tree."
ذَٰلِكَ جَزَيْنَاهُمْ بِمَا كَفَرُواْ وَهَلْ نُجَٰزِيۤ إِلاَّ ٱلْكَفُورَ,This We awarded them) What befell them was a punishment (because of their ingratitude) for the blessings of Allah. (Punish We ever any save the ingrates) those who are ungrateful towards Allah and towards His blessings?
وَجَعَلْنَا بَيْنَهُمْ وَبَيْنَ ٱلْقُرَى ٱلَّتِي بَارَكْنَا فِيهَا قُرًى ظَاهِرَةً وَقَدَّرْنَا فِيهَا ٱلسَّيْرَ سِيرُواْ فِيهَا لَيَالِيَ وَأَيَّاماً آمِنِينَ,"(And We set, between them) between the people of Sheba (and the towns which We had blessed) with water and trees, i.e. Jordan and Palestine, (towns easy to be seen) and close to each other, (and We made the stage between them) between these towns (easy) the march to them is a few hours or one night march, ((saying): Travel in them safely both by night and day) safe from hunger, thirst and thieves."
فَقَالُواْ رَبَّنَا بَاعِدْ بَيْنَ أَسْفَارِنَا وَظَلَمُوۤاْ أَنفُسَهُمْ فَجَعَلْنَاهُمْ أَحَادِيثَ وَمَزَّقْنَاهُمْ كُلَّ مُمَزَّقٍ إِنَّ فِي ذَلِكَ لآيَاتٍ لِّكُلِّ صَبَّارٍ شَكُورٍ,"After this their prophets said to them: “Give thanks for the blessings of your Lord lest He takes them away as He took away the blessings he gave you before”. (But they said: Our Lord!) O our Lord! (Make the stage between our journeys longer. And they wronged themselves) by means of disbelief and idolatry and failed to give thanks for those bounties, (therefore We made them bywords (in the land)) for people who came after them (and scattered them abroad) in different lands, (a total scattering) and We destroyed them completely. (Lo! Herein) in what We have done to them (verily are portents) signs and lessons (for each steadfast) in obedience, (grateful (heart)) for the bounties of Allah."
وَلَقَدْ صَدَّقَ عَلَيْهِمْ إِبْلِيسُ ظَنَّهُ فَٱتَّبَعُوهُ إِلاَّ فَرِيقاً مِّنَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,"(And Satan indeed found his calculation true concerning them, for they follow him) in their disbelief, (all save a group of true believers) it is also said that this means: they followed him by engaging in transgressions except for a group of believers who will enter Paradise without reckoning or punishment."
وَمَا كَانَ لَهُ عَلَيْهِمْ مِّن سُلْطَانٍ إِلاَّ لِنَعْلَمَ مَن يُؤْمِنُ بِٱلآخِرَةِ مِمَّنْ هُوَ مِنْهَا فِي شَكٍّ وَرَبُّكَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ حَفُيظٌ,"(And he) Satan (had no warrant) no power or the ability to impose his will (whatsoever against them) against the Children of Israel, (save) except to the measure (that We would know him who believeth in the Hereafter) that We know he who, in preeternity, believed in resurrection after death (from him who is in doubt thereof) from him who is in doubt about the coming of the Hour; (and thy Lord) O Muhammad (taketh note of all things) relating to their works."
قُلِ ٱدْعُواْ ٱلَّذِينَ زَعَمْتُمْ مِّن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ لاَ يَمْلِكُونَ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَلاَ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَمَا لَهُمْ فِيهِمَا مِن شِرْكٍ وَمَا لَهُ مِنْهُمْ مِّن ظَهِيرٍ,"(Say) O Muhammad, to the disbelievers of Mecca, the Banu Malih: (Call upon those whom ye set up) you worship (beside Allah) so that they answer you! This is because the Banu Malih worshipped the jinn, thinking they were angels. Allah said to them: (They possess not) they cannot benefit you (an atom's weight either in the heavens or the earth, nor have they) the angels (any share) partnership with Allah (either, nor hath He an auxiliary among them) nor has He a helper among the angels who helped Him to create the heavens and the earth."
وَلاَ تَنفَعُ ٱلشَّفَاعَةُ عِندَهُ إِلاَّ لِمَنْ أَذِنَ لَهُ حَتَّىٰ إِذَا فُزِّعَ عَن قُلُوبِهِمْ قَالُواْ مَاذَا قَالَ رَبُّكُمْ قَالُواْ ٱلْحَقَّ وَهُوَ ٱلْعَلِيُّ ٱلْكَبِيرُ,"(No intercession availeth) the angels will not intercede (with Him) on the Day of Judgement (save for him whom He permitteth) to intercede. Allah then mentions the weakness of the angels, for when the angels heard Allah uttering the revelation to Gabriel in order to take it to Muhammad (pbuh) they passed out due to the awe they sensed from Allah's speech. And they remained in this state. (Yet, when fear is banished from their hearts) and Gabriel came down to them, and they lifted their heads, (they say) the angels said to Gabriel and the angels who were with him: (What was it that your Lord said) O Gabriel? (They say) Gabriel and the angels with him say: (The Truth) the Qur'an. (And He is the Sublime) more sublime than anyone and anything, (the Great) greater than everyone and everything."
قُلْ مَن يَرْزُقُكُمْ مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ قُلِ ٱللَّهُ وَإِنَّآ أَوْ إِيَّاكُمْ لَعَلَىٰ هُدًى أَوْ فِي ضَلاَلٍ مُّبِينٍ,"(Say) O Muhammad, to the disbelievers of Mecca: (Who giveth you provision from the sky) through rain (and the earth) through vegetation? If they answer you that it is Allah, then it is fine; if not, (Say: Allah) gives you provision. (Lo! we or you) O people of Mecca (assuredly are rightly guided or in error manifest) regarding Allah's provision; it is also said that this means: we are, group of believers, following the guidance, while you, O people of Mecca, in manifest disbelief and error."
قُل لاَّ تُسْأَلُونَ عَمَّآ أَجْرَمْنَا وَلاَ نُسْأَلُ عَمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ,"(Say) to them, O Muhammad: (Ye will not be asked of what we committed) of sins, (nor shall we be asked of what ye do) in your state of disbelief. But this was later abrogated by the verse of the sword."
قُلْ يَجْمَعُ بَيْنَنَا رَبُّنَا ثُمَّ يَفْتَحُ بَيْنَنَا بِٱلْحَقِّ وَهُوَ ٱلْفَتَّاحُ ٱلْعَلِيمُ,"(Say: Our Lord will bring us all together) on the Day of Judgement, (then He will judge between us with truth) with justice. (He is the All-Knowing Judge) He is the Judge and He knows the judgement."
قُلْ أَرُونِيَ ٱلَّذيِنَ أَلْحَقْتُمْ بِهِ شُرَكَآءَ كَلاَّ بَلْ هُوَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْحْكِيمُ,"(Say) O Muhammad, to the people of Mecca: (Show me those whom ye have joined) ascribe (unto Him as partners) from among the idols; what have they created? Allah then said to them: (Nay (ye dare not)) because, they truly have not created anything! (For He is Allah) He created all that, (the Mighty) in retribution against the disbelievers, (the Wise) in His command and judgement; He commanded that none should be worshipped save Him."
وَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَاكَ إِلاَّ كَآفَّةً لِّلنَّاسِ بَشِيراً وَنَذِيراً وَلَـٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ ٱلنَّاسِ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ,(And We have not sent thee) O Muhammad (save as a bringer of good tidings) Paradise for those who believe in Allah (and a warner) from the Fire for those who disbelieve in Him (unto all mankind) to the jinn and human beings; (but most of mankind) the people of Mecca (know not) this nor believe in it.
وَيَقُولُونَ مَتَىٰ هَـٰذَا ٱلْوَعْدُ إِن كُنتُمْ صَادِقِينَ,(And they) the disbelievers of Mecca (say: When is this promise) O Muhammad ((to be fulfilled) if ye are truthful) if you are truthful that we will be raised after we die?
قُل لَّكُم مِّيعَادُ يَوْمٍ لاَّ تَسْتَأْخِرُونَ عَنْهُ سَاعَةً وَلاَ تَسْتَقْدِمُونَ,(Say) O Muhammad: (Yours is the promise of a Day which) the tryst of the Day of Judgement (ye cannot postpone nor hasten by an hour) the appointed time.
وَقَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لَن نُّؤْمِنَ بِهَـٰذَا ٱلْقُرْآنِ وَلاَ بِٱلَّذِي بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ وَلَوْ تَرَىٰ إِذِ ٱلظَّالِمُونَ مَوْقُوفُونَ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ يَرْجِعُ بَعْضُهُمْ إِلَىٰ بَعْضٍ ٱلْقَوْلَ يَقُولُ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱسْتُضْعِفُواْ لِلَّذِينَ ٱسْتَكْبَرُواْ لَوْلاَ أَنتُمْ لَكُنَّا مُؤْمِنِينَ,"(And those who disbelieve) the disbelievers of Mecca: Abu Jahl Ibn Hisham and his host (say: We believe not in this Qur'an) which Muhammad (pbuh) recite unto us (nor in that which was before it) nor do we believe in the Scriptures revealed before him: the Torah and the Gospel and all the other Scriptures; (but oh, if thou couldst see) O Muhammad, (when the wrong-doers) the idolaters: Abu Jahl and his host (are brought up before their Lord) restrained on the Day of Judgement, (how they cast the blame one to another) they argue with each other and curse one another; (how those who were despised (in the earth)) how those who were oppressed in the earth, these are the lowly among people (say unto those who were proud) too proud to accept faith: i.e. the leaders: (But for you, we should have been believers) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an."
قَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱسْتَكْبَرُواْ لِلَّذِينَ ٱسْتُضْعِفُوۤاْ أَنَحْنُ صَدَدنَاكُمْ عَنِ ٱلْهُدَىٰ بَعْدَ إِذْ جَآءَكُمْ بَلْ كُنتُمْ مُّجْرِمِينَ,"(And those who were proud) too proud to accept faith, i.e. the leader, (say unto those who were despised) those who were oppressed, i.e. the lowly people: (Did we drive you away) did we bar you (from the guidance) from faith (after it had come unto you) after it came to you from Muhammad (pbuh)? (Nay, but ye were guilty) you were idolaters before the coming of Muhammad to you."
وَقَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱسْتُضْعِفُواْ لِلَّذِينَ ٱسْتَكْبَرُواْ بَلْ مَكْرُ ٱلَّيلِ وَٱلنَّهَارِ إِذْ تَأْمُرُونَنَآ أَن نَّكْفُرَ بِٱللَّهِ وَنَجْعَلَ لَهُ أَندَاداً وَأَسَرُّواْ ٱلنَّدَامَةَ لَمَّا رَأَوُاْ ٱلْعَذَابَ وَجَعَلْنَا ٱلأَغْلاَلَ فِيۤ أَعْنَاقِ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ هَلْ يُجْزَوْنَ إِلاَّ مَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ,"(Those who were despised) those who were oppressed, who are the lowly among people (say unto those who were proud) their leaders: (Nay but (it was your) scheming night and day) it is what you said to us by day and night, (when ye commanded us to disbelieve in Allah) when you told us to disbelieve in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an (and set up rivals) equals and forms (unto Him. And they are filled with remorse) both the leaders and those who obeyed them (when they behold the doom; and We place carcans on the necks of those who disbelieved) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an. He says: their hands were tied to their necks. (Are they requited) on the Day of Judgement (aught save what they did) and said in their state of disbelief?"
وَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَا فِي قَرْيَةٍ مِّن نَّذِيرٍ إِلاَّ قَالَ مُتْرَفُوهَآ إِنَّا بِمَآ أُرْسِلْتُمْ بِهِ كَافِرُونَ,"(And We sent not unto any township) to the inhabitants of any township (a warner) a warning Messenger, (but its pampered ones) its tyrants and despots (declared: Lo! we are disbelievers in that which ye bring unto us) we deny what you brought us."
وَقَالُواْ نَحْنُ أَكْثَـرُ أَمْوَالاً وَأَوْلاَداً وَمَا نَحْنُ بِمُعَذَّبِينَ,(And they say) to the messengers: (We are more (than you) in wealth and children. We are not the punished) because of our religion in spite of all the wealth and children that we have! And this is exactly what the disbelievers of Mecca said to Muhammad (pbuh).
قُلْ إِنَّ رَبِّي يَبْسُطُ ٱلرِّزْقَ لِمَن يَشَآءُ وَيَقْدِرُ وَلَـٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ ٱلنَّاسِ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ,(Say) O Muhammad: (Lo! my Lord enlargeth the provision for whom He will) as a lure to perdition (and narroweth it (for whom He will) out of care for him. (But most of mankind) the people of Mecca (know not) this nor believe it.
وَمَآ أَمْوَالُكُمْ وَلاَ أَوْلاَدُكُمْ بِٱلَّتِي تُقَرِّبُكُمْ عِندَنَا زُلْفَىٰ إِلاَّ مَنْ آمَنَ وَعَمِلَ صَالِحاً فَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ لَهُمْ جَزَآءُ ٱلضِّعْفِ بِمَا عَمِلُواْ وَهُمْ فِي ٱلْغُرُفَاتِ آمِنُونَ,"(And it is not your wealth) the abundance of your wealth, O people of Mecca, (nor your children) nor the abundance of your children (that will bring you near unto Us) that will make your rank closer to Allah, (but he who believeth) in Allah, but it is the faith of he who believes in Allah (and doeth good) between him and his Lord that bring one close to Allah. (As for such, theirs will be twofold reward for what they did) as believers, (and they will dwell secure in lofty halls) secure from death and evanescence."

(And We shall say unto those who did wrong) those who ascribed partners to Allah: (Taste the doom of the Fire which ye used to deny) in the life of the world.
وَإِذَا تُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْهِمْ آيَاتُنَا بَيِّنَاتٍ قَالُواْ مَا هَـٰذَا إِلاَّ رَجُلٌ يُرِيدُ أَن يَصُدَّكُمْ عَمَّا كَانَ يَعْبُدُ آبَآؤُكُمْ وَقَالُواْ مَا هَـٰذَآ إِلاَّ إِفْكٌ مُّفْتَرًى وَقَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لِلْحَقِّ لَمَّا جَآءَهُمْ إِنْ هَـٰذَآ إِلاَّ سِحْرٌ مُّبِينٌ,"(And if Our revelations) the verses of the Qur'an (are recited unto them) unto the disbelievers of Mecca (in plain terms) expositing the lawful and the unlawful, (they say: This) i.e. Muhammad (pbuh) (is naught else than a man who would turn you away) bar you (from what your fathers used to worship) of idols; (and they say: This) what Muhammad (pbuh) say (is naught else than an invented lie.

(Is there any creator) any god (other than Allah who provideth for you from the sky) rain (and the earth) vegetation? (There is no God save Him) who provides you. (Whither then are ye turned) from whence do you lie and claim that your deities provide for you?"
وَإِن يُكَذِّبُوكَ فَقَدْ كُذِّبَتْ رُسُلٌ مِّن قَبْلِكَ وَإِلَى ٱللَّهِ تُرْجَعُ ٱلأُمُورُ,"(And if they) the Quraysh (deny thee, (O Muhammad), messengers (of Allah) were denied before thee) their folks denied them just as your people are denying you. (Unto Allah all things are brought back) the end results of all things are brought back to Allah in the Hereafter."
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّاسُ إِنَّ وَعْدَ ٱللَّهِ حَقٌّ فَلاَ تَغُرَّنَّكُمُ ٱلْحَيَاةُ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَلاَ يَغُرَّنَّكُمْ بِٱللَّهِ ٱلْغَرُورُ,"(O mankind) O people of Mecca! (Lo! the promise of Allah) i.e. resurrection after death (is true) it will surely happen. (So let not the life of the world) let not what is in the life of the world of comfort and adornment (beguile you) with regard to the obedience of Allah, (and let not the (avowed) beguiler) Satan; and it is said: the falsehoods of the life of this world (beguile you with regard to Allah) with regard to the religion of Allah."
إِنَّ ٱلشَّيْطَانَ لَكُمْ عَدُوٌّ فَٱتَّخِذُوهُ عَدُوّاً إِنَّمَا يَدْعُواْ حِزْبَهُ لِيَكُونُواْ مِنْ أَصْحَابِ ٱلسَّعِيرِ,"(Lo! the devil is an enemy for you) as regards religion and obedience, (so treat him as an enemy) so fight him and do not obey him as far as religion and obedience are concerned. (He only summoneth his faction) the adherents of his religion and obedient ones (to be owners of the flaming Fire) to be gathered with the inhabitants of hell in the Fire."
ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ شَدِيدٌ وَٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ لَهُم مَّغْفِرَةٌ وَأَجْرٌ كَبِيرٌ,"(Those who disbelieve) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an, i.e. Abu Jahl and his host, (theirs will be an awful doom; and those who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an (and do good works) and do acts of obedience between them and their Lord, (theirs will be forgiveness) their sins will be forgiven in the life of this world (and a great reward) in Paradise."
أَفَمَن زُيِّنَ لَهُ سُوۤءُ عَمَلِهِ فَرَآهُ حَسَناً فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُضِلُّ مَن يَشَآءُ وَيَهْدِي مَن يَشَآءُ فَلاَ تَذْهَبْ نَفْسُكَ عَلَيْهِمْ حَسَرَاتٍ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلِيمٌ بِمَا يَصْنَعُونَ,"(Is he, the evil of whose deeds is made fair-seeming unto him so that he deemeth it good) right-the reference here is to Abu Jahl-like those whom We honoured with faith and obedience, i.e. Abu Bakr al-Siddiq and his fellow believers? (Allah verily sendeth whom He will astray) He sends away from His religion whoever deserves it, (and guideth) to His religion (whom He will) whoever deserves it, i.e. Abu Bakr and his fellow believers, (so let not thy soul expire) do not kill yourself with grief (in sighings for them) in remorse about their destruction, if they reject faith. (Lo! Allah is Aware of what they do) in their state of disbelief of scheming in Dar al-Nadwah and treachery in order to kill Muhammad (pbuh)!"
وَٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِيۤ أَرْسَلَ ٱلرِّيَاحَ فَتُثِيرُ سَحَاباً فَسُقْنَاهُ إِلَىٰ بَلَدٍ مَّيِّتٍ فَأَحْيَيْنَا بِهِ ٱلأَرْضَ بَعْدَ مَوْتِهَا كَذَلِكَ ٱلنُّشُورُ,(And Allah it is Who sendeth the winds and they raise a cloud; then We lead it) through rain (unto a dead land) wherein there is no plants (and revive therewith) by means of the rain (the earth after its death) after its dryness and exposure to draught. (Such is the Resurrection) in the same way you will be quickened and raised from the graves.
مَن كَانَ يُرِيدُ ٱلْعِزَّةَ فَلِلَّهِ ٱلْعِزَّةُ جَمِيعاً إِلَيْهِ يَصْعَدُ ٱلْكَلِمُ ٱلطَّيِّبُ وَٱلْعَمَلُ ٱلصَّالِحُ يَرْفَعُهُ وَٱلَّذِينَ يَمْكُرُونَ ٱلسَّيِّئَاتِ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ شَدِيدٌ وَمَكْرُ أُوْلَئِكَ هُوَ يَبُورُ,"(Whoso desireth power) i.e. whoever desires to know to whom belongs power, might and invincibility, ((should know that) all power belongeth to Allah) as belongs to Him might and invincibility. (Unto Him good words) the expression “there is no deity save Allah” (ascend, and the pious deed doth He exalt) He accepts pious deeds through the profession of “there is no deity except Allah”; (but those who plot iniquities) those who associate partners with Allah; it is also said this means: those who scheme to expel, imprison or assassinate Muhammad (pbuh) in Dar al-Nadwah, (theirs will be an awful doom) as awful as can be; (and the plotting of such (folk)) i.e. Abu Jahl and his host (will come to naught) will not succeed. It is also said that this verse was revealed about the people who deal with usury."
وَٱللَّهُ خَلَقَكُمْ مِّن تُرَابٍ ثُمَّ مِن نُّطْفَةٍ ثُمَّ جَعَلَكُمْ أَزْوَاجاً وَمَا تَحْمِلُ مِنْ أُنْثَىٰ وَلاَ تَضَعُ إِلاَّ بِعِلْمِهِ وَمَا يُعَمَّرُ مِن مُّعَمَّرٍ وَلاَ يُنقَصُ مِنْ عُمُرِهِ إِلاَّ فِي كِتَابٍ إِنَّ ذَلِكَ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ يَسِيرٌ,"(Allah created you from dust) He created you from Adam and Adam is from dust, (then from a little fluid) the sperm drops of your fathers, (then He made you pairs (the male and female). No female beareth) a child (or bringeth forth) gives birth after the full period of pregnancy or prematurely (save with His knowledge) save with the knowledge and command of Allah. (And no one groweth old who groweth old, nor is aught lessened of his life, but it is recorded in a Book) except that it is recorded in the Guarded Tablet. (Lo! That) recording that (is easy for Allah) even without writing."
وَمَا يَسْتَوِي ٱلْبَحْرَانِ هَـٰذَا عَذْبٌ فُرَاتٌ سَآئِغٌ شَرَابُهُ وَهَـٰذَا مِلْحٌ أُجَاجٌ وَمِن كُلٍّ تَأْكُلُونَ لَحْماً طَرِيّاً وَتَسْتَخْرِجُونَ حِلْيَةً تَلْبَسُونَهَا وَتَرَى ٱلْفُلْكَ فِيهِ مَوَاخِرَ لِتَبْتَغُواْ مِن فَضْلِهِ وَلَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ,"(And the two seas) the sweet and salty (are not alike: this, fresh, sweet, food to drink, this (other) bitter, salt. And from them both) the sweet and salty seas (ye eat fresh meat) fresh fish (and derive) especially from the salty sea (the ornament) gems and pearls (that ye wear. And thou seest the ship cleaving them) i.e. the seas (with its prow) coming and going driven by the same wind (that ye may seek of His bounty) of His provision, (and that haply ye may give thanks) so that you may give thanks for His bounty."
يُولِجُ ٱلْلَّيْلَ فِي ٱلنَّهَارِ وَيُولِجُ ٱلنَّهَارَ فِي ٱلْلَّيْلِ وَسَخَّرَ ٱلشَّمْسَ وَٱلْقَمَرَ كُلٌّ يَجْرِي لأَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّى ذَلِكُمُ ٱللَّهُ رَبُّكُمْ لَهُ ٱلْمُلْكُ وَٱلَّذِينَ تَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِهِ مَا يَمْلِكُونَ مِن قِطْمِيرٍ,"(He maketh the night to pass into the day) such that the night is longer than the day by, for instance, six hours (and He maketh the day to pass into the night) such that the day is longer than the night by, let us say, six hours. (He hath subdued the sun and moon to service) He subdued the light of the sun and the moon to the service of human beings. (Each runneth unto an appointed term) round appointed trajectories. (Such is Allah, your Lord) it is Allah, your Lord, Who does so, not the deities; (His is the Sovereignty) the storehouses of the universe; (and those unto whom you pray) those whom you worship (instead of Him) instead of Allah (own not so much as the white spot on a date stone) they are unable to own of all that even the white spot on a date stone."
إِن تَدْعُوهُمْ لاَ يَسْمَعُواْ دُعَآءَكُمْ وَلَوْ سَمِعُواْ مَا ٱسْتَجَابُواْ لَكُمْ وَيَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ يَكْفُرُونَ بِشِرْكِـكُمْ وَلاَ يُنَبِّئُكَ مِثْلُ خَبِيرٍ,"(If ye pray unto them) i.e. the deities (they hear not your prayer) because they are deaf and dumb, (and if they heard they could not grant it you) because they despise you. (On the Day of Resurrection they will disown association with you) the deities will absolve themselves from you for associating them as partners with Allah and for worshipping them beside Allah. (None can Inform you) of them and their works (like Him Who is Aware) i.e. Allah."
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّاسُ أَنتُمُ ٱلْفُقَرَآءُ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ وَٱللَّهُ هُوَ ٱلْغَنِيُّ ٱلْحَمِيدُ,"(O mankind! Ye are the poor in your relation to Allah) in relation to His forgiveness, mercy, provision and well-being in the life of this world and to His Paradise in the Hereafter. (And Allah! He is the Absolute) He is free of need for what you have of wealth, (the Owner of Praise) He is praiseworthy in His acts."
إِن يَشَأْ يُذْهِبْكُـمْ وَيَأْتِ بِخَلْقٍ جَدِيدٍ,"(If He will, He can be rid of you) He can destroy you, O people of Mecca (and bring (instead of you) some new creation) who are better and more obedient than you."
وَمَا ذَلِكَ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ بِعَزِيزٍ,(That) i.e. destroying you and bringing a new creation (is not a hard thing for Allah.

(Thou warnest only) your warning, O Muhammad, benefits only (those who fear their Lord in secret) those who work for their Lord even though He is invisible to them, but nothing is invisible to Him, (and have established worship) and perform the five daily prayers. (He who groweth (in goodness)) he who believes in Allah's divine Oneness, does good works and spends of his wealth in charity, (groweth only for himself) the reward of all this goes to his own soul. (Unto Allah is the journeying) unto Allah is the return in the Hereafter."
وَمَا يَسْتَوِي ٱلأَعْمَىٰ وَٱلْبَصِيرُ,(The blind man) the disbeliever (is not equal with the seer) the believer;
وَلاَ ٱلظُّلُمَاتُ وَلاَ ٱلنُّورُ,(Nor is darkness (tantamount to) light) i.e. nor is disbelief like faith;
وَلاَ ٱلظِّلُّ وَلاَ ٱلْحَرُورُ,(Nor is the shadow equal with the sun's full heat) nor is Paradise equal to the Fire;
وَمَا يَسْتَوِي ٱلأَحْيَآءُ وَلاَ ٱلأَمْوَاتُ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُسْمِعُ مَن يَشَآءُ وَمَآ أَنتَ بِمُسْمِعٍ مَّن فِي ٱلْقُبُورِ,(Nor are the living equal with the dead) nor are the believers equal with the disbelievers in relation to obedience and honour. (Lo! Allah maketh whom He will) whoever deserves it (to hear) to understand. (Thou canst not reach) you cannot make understand (those who are in the graves) those who are as if dead and buried in the graves.
إِنْ أَنتَ إِلاَّ نَذِيرٌ,(Thou) O Muhammad (art but a warner) a Messenger warning by the Qur'an.
إِنَّآ أَرْسَلْنَاكَ بِٱلْحَقِّ بَشِيراً وَنَذِيراً وَإِن مِّنْ أُمَّةٍ إِلاَّ خَلاَ فِيهَا نَذِيرٌ,"(Lo! We have sent thee) O Muhammad (with the Truth) with the Qur'an, (a bearer of glad tidings) announcing Paradise for whoever believes in Allah (and a warner) from the Fire for whoever disbelieves in Allah; (and there is not a nation but a warner has passed among them) except that they had a warning messenger."
وَإِن يُكَذِّبُوكَ فَقَدْ كَذَّبَ ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ جَآءَتْهُمْ رُسُلُهُم بِٱلْبَيِّنَاتِ وَبِٱلزُّبُرِ وَبِٱلْكِتَابِ ٱلْمُنِيرِ,"(And if they) the Quraysh (deny thee) O Muhammad: (those before them also denied) those before your own folk, the Quraysh, have also denied their messengers. (Their messengers came unto them with clear proofs (of Allah's Sovereignty)) they came to them with commands, prohibitions and signs, (and with the Psalms and the Scripture) and with the events of the Scriptures of the people of old (giving light) expositing the lawful and the unlawful."
ثُمَّ أَخَذْتُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ فَكَيْفَ كَانَ نَكِيرِ,"(Then seized I) then I punished (those who disbelieved) in the Scriptures and messengers, (and how intense was My abhorrence!) see, O Muhammad, how I turned against them with chastisement when they rejected faith."
أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ أنزَلَ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مَآءً فَأَخْرَجْنَا بِهِ ثَمَرَاتٍ مُّخْتَلِفاً أَلْوَانُهَا وَمِنَ ٱلْجِبَالِ جُدَدٌ بِيضٌ وَحُمْرٌ مُّخْتَلِفٌ أَلْوَانُهَا وَغَرَابِيبُ سُودٌ,"(Hast thou not seen) do you not know (that Allah causeth water) the rain (to fall from the sky, and We produce therewith fruit of diverse hues) sweet and sour fruits as well as other kinds; (and among the hills are streaks white and red, of diverse hues) like the diverse fruits, (and (others) raven black) black mountains, very intense in their blackness;"

(The erudite among His bondsmen fear Allah alone) He says: from among all His servants, it is the erudite who fears Allah. (Lo! Allah is Mighty) in His dominion and kingdom, (Forgiving) He forgives whoever believes in Him."
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يَتْلُونَ كِتَابَ ٱللَّهِ وَأَقَامُواْ ٱلصَّلاَةَ وَأَنفَقُواْ مِمَّا رَزَقْنَاهُمْ سِرّاً وَعَلاَنِيَةً يَرْجُونَ تِجَارَةً لَّن تَبُورَ,"(Lo! those who read the Scripture of Allah) those who read the Qur'an, i.e. Abu Bakr and his fellow believers, (and establish worship) and perform the five daily prayers, (and spend) in charity (of that which We have bestowed on them) of wealth (secretly) between them and Allah (and openly) in front of people, (they look forward to imperishable gain) i.e. Paradise,"
لِيُوَفِّيَهُمْ أُجُورَهُمْ وَيَزِيدَهُم مِّن فَضْلِهِ إِنَّهُ غَفُورٌ شَكُورٌ,"(That He) Allah (will pay them their wages) their reward in Paradise (and increase them of His grace) one to tenfolds.

وَٱلَّذِيۤ أَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَيْكَ مِنَ ٱلْكِتَابِ هُوَ ٱلْحَقُّ مُصَدِّقاً لِّمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ بِعِبَادِهِ لَخَبِيرٌ بَصِيرٌ,"(As for that which We inspire in thee) as for that with which We send Gabriel to you (of the Scripture) i.e. the Qur'an, (it is the Truth confirming) Allah's divine Oneness and also agrees with some laws (that which was (revealed) before it) of earlier Scriptures. (Lo! Allah is indeed Observer) He is aware of those who believe and those who do not, (Seer of his slaves) He sees their works."
ثُمَّ أَوْرَثْنَا ٱلْكِتَابَ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱصْطَفَيْنَا مِنْ عِبَادِنَا فَمِنْهُمْ ظَالِمٌ لِّنَفْسِهِ وَمِنْهُمْ مُّقْتَصِدٌ وَمِنْهُمْ سَابِقٌ بِٱلْخَيْرَاتِ بِإِذُنِ ٱللَّهِ ذَلِكَ هُوَ ٱلْفَضْلُ ٱلْكَبِيرُ,"(Then) after We sent Gabriel with the Qur'an to Muhammad (pbuh) (We gave the Scripture as inheritance) We gave the honour of memorising, writing and reciting the Qur'an (unto those whom We elected of our bondmen) by means of faith, i.e. the community of Muhammad (pbuh). (But of them are some who wrong themselves) through committing enormities, and these will not be saved unless there is intercession in their favour, or unless they are forgiven or when Allah's promise is fulfilled (and of them are some who are lukewarm) some of them did good works and evil works in equal measure; these will be slightly taken to task and then be saved, (and of them are some who outstrip (others) through good deeds) in the life of this world and among those brought near to the Garden of Eden in the Hereafter, (by Allah's leave) by Allah's given success and beneficence. (That) selection and outstripping (is the great favour) the greatest grace that Allah can bestow upon them!"

(They enter them wearing armlets of gold and pearl) this is the attire of women while the attire of men will be made of gold (and their raiment therein) in Paradise (is silk)."
وَقَالُواْ ٱلْحَمْدُ للَّهِ ٱلَّذِيۤ أَذْهَبَ عَنَّا ٱلْحَزَنَ إِنَّ رَبَّنَا لَغَفُورٌ شَكُورٌ,"(And they say) the inhabitants of Paradise say in Paradise: (Praise be to Allah) thanks and gratitude belong to Allah (who hath put grief) the grief of death, evanescence and the terrors of the Day of Judgement; it is also said that this means: the grief of the risks involved in the life of this world (away from us.

O our Lord! (Release us) from the Fire and return us to the life of the world, for we will believe in You; and (we will do right) sincerely believing in You, (not (the wrong) that we used to do) in our state of idolatry. Allah will say to them: (Did not We grant you a life) did We not give you, O group of disbelievers, in the life of the world a respite (long enough for who reflected to reflect) long enough for reflection (therein) for anyone who wanted to reflect? (And the warner) Muhammad (pbuh) (came unto you) with the Qur'an and warned you against this day, but you did not believe him. (Now taste (the flavour of your deeds)) taste the torment of the Fire, (for evil-doers) the disbelievers (have no helper) to save them from Allah's chastisement."

Lo! He is ever Clement) despite the claim of the Jews and Christians, (Forgiving) He forgives whoever repents of them."

وَأَنِ ٱعْبُدُونِي هَـٰذَا صِرَاطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ,"(But that ye worship Me) but that you should believe in My divine Oneness? (That) the profession of Allah's divine Oneness (was the right path) a straight, true religion."
وَلَقَدْ أَضَلَّ مِنْكُمْ جِبِلاًّ كَثِيراً أَفَلَمْ تَكُونُواْ تَعْقِلُونَ,"(Yet he) the devil (hath led astray of you) O children of Adam (a great multitude) of people before you. (Had ye then no sense) did you not know what he did to them, and hence avoid following their path?"
هَـٰذِهِ جَهَنَّمُ ٱلَّتِي كُنتُمْ تُوعَدُونَ,(This is hell which you were promised) in the life of the world.
ٱصْلَوْهَا ٱلْيَوْمَ بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَكْفُرُونَ,(Burn therein this day for that you disbelieved) in it and also because of your denial of the Scriptures and the messengers.
ٱلْيَوْمَ نَخْتِمُ عَلَىٰ أَفْوَاهِهِمْ وَتُكَلِّمُنَآ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَتَشْهَدُ أَرْجُلُهُمْ بِمَا كَانُواْ يَكْسِبُونَ,"(This day) which is the Day of Judgement (We seal up mouths) We prevent them from talking because of their denial, (and hands speak out) revealing what they had struck (and feet bear witness) testify about where they went and their limbs testify (as to what they used to earn) of evil."
وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لَطَمَسْنَا عَلَىٰ أَعْيُنِهِمْ فَٱسْتَبَقُواْ ٱلصِّرَاطَ فَأَنَّىٰ يُبْصِرُونَ,"(And had We willed, We verily could have quenched their eyesight) verily, We would have quenched the eyes of their error (so that they should struggle for the way) so that they would see the way. (Then how could they have seen) how could they see the way when their error has not been removed?"
وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لَمَسَخْنَاهُمْ عَلَىٰ مَكَـانَتِهِمْ فَمَا ٱسْتَطَاعُواْ مُضِيّاً وَلاَ يَرْجِعُونَ,"(And had We willed, We verily could have fixed them in their place) We could have turned them into apes and swine in their own homes, (making them powerless to go forward) making them unable to come and go (or turn back) to their initial state."
وَمَن نُّعَمِّرْهُ نُنَكِّـسْهُ فِي ٱلْخَلْقِ أَفَلاَ يَعْقِلُونَ,"(He whom We bring unto old age, We reverse him in creation (making him go back to weakness after strength)) until he becomes like a little child, possessing no teeth or power, he urinates and defecates on himself like a young child. (Have ye then no sense) do you then not believe in this?"
وَمَا عَلَّمْنَاهُ ٱلشِّعْرَ وَمَا يَنبَغِي لَهُ إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ ذِكْرٌ وَقُرْآنٌ مُّبِينٌ,"(And we have not taught him) i.e. Muhammad (pbuh) (poetry, nor is it meet for him) poetry is not appropriate for him. (This is) i.e. the Qur'an (naught else than a Reminder) an admonition (and a Lecture making plain) the lawful and unlawful, the commands and prohibitions,"
لِّيُنذِرَ مَن كَانَ حَيّاً وَيَحِقَّ ٱلْقَوْلُ عَلَى ٱلْكَافِرِينَ,"(To warn) so that Muhammad (pbuh) warns by means of the Qur'an (whosoever liveth) whoever has an intellect, (and that the word) enjoining wrath and punishment (may be fulfilled against the disbelievers) of Mecca such that they do not believe in Muhammad (pbuh) or in the Qur'an."
أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْاْ أَنَّا خَلَقْنَا لَهُم مِمَّا عَمِلَتْ أَيْدِينَآ أَنْعاماً فَهُمْ لَهَا مَالِكُونَ,"(Have they not seen) have they not been informed (how We have created for them) for the people of Mecca (of Our handiwork) by means of Our power (the cattle, so that they are their owners) and controllers,"
وَذَلَّلْنَاهَا لَهُمْ فَمِنْهَا رَكُوبُهُمْ وَمِنْهَا يَأْكُلُونَ,"(And have subdued them unto them) and made the cattle subservient to them, (so that some of them they have for riding, some for food) their meat is food for them?"
وَلَهُمْ فِيهَا مَنَافِعُ وَمَشَارِبُ أَفَلاَ يَشْكُرُونَ,"(Benefits) carrying their loads and trading through them (and (divers) drinks) from their milk (have they) i.e. the people of Mecca (from them) from the cattle. (Will they not then give thanks) to He Who did this for them and, thus, believe in Him?"
وَٱتَّخَذُواْ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ آلِهَةً لَّعَلَّهُمْ يُنصَرُونَ,"(And they have) and the disbelievers of Mecca worshipped ((other) gods) idols (beside Allah, in order that they may be helped) so that they may save them from Allah's punishment."
لاَ يَسْتَطِيعُونَ نَصْرَهُمْ وَهُمْ لَهُمْ جُندٌ مُّحْضَرُونَ,(It is not in their power to help them) the idols are unable to save them from Allah's chastisement; (but they) i.e. the disbelievers of Mecca (are unto them) in falsehood (a host in arms) like slaves standing before the idols.
فَلاَ يَحْزُنكَ قَوْلُهُمْ إِنَّا نَعْلَمُ مَا يُسِرُّونَ وَمَا يُعْلِنُونَ,(So let not their speech) their denial (grieve thee) O Muhammad. (Lo! We know what they conceal) of plotting and treachery (and proclaim) of enmity.
أَوَلَمْ يَرَ ٱلإِنسَانُ أَنَّا خَلَقْنَاهُ مِن نُّطْفَةٍ فَإِذَا هُوَ خَصِيمٌ مُّبِينٌ,(Hath not man seen) does not Ubayy Ibn Khalaf know (that We have created him from a drop of seed) of a weak and stinking sperm drop? (Yet lo! he is an open opponent) he openly argues in falsehood.
وَضَرَبَ لَنَا مَثَلاً وَنَسِيَ خَلْقَهُ قَالَ مَن يُحيِي ٱلْعِظَامَ وَهِيَ رَمِيمٌ,"(And he hath coined for Us a similitude) he gave Us a similitude regarding bones, (and hath forgotten the fact of his creation) he left out the mention of his initial creation, (saying: Who will revive these bones when they have rotted away) who will revive these bones when they become dust?"
قُلْ يُحْيِيهَا ٱلَّذِيۤ أَنشَأَهَآ أَوَّلَ مَرَّةٍ وَهُوَ بِكُلِّ خَلْقٍ عَلِيمٌ,"(Say) to him, O Muhammad: (He will revive them Who produced them) Who created them (at the first) from a sperm drop, (for He is Knower of every creation) He is Knower of the creation of everything,"

فَسُبْحَانَ ٱلَّذِي بِيَدِهِ مَلَكُوتُ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ وَإِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ,(Therefore glory be to Him) Allah glorified Himself (in Whose hand is the dominion over all things) the stores of all things and the creating of all things! (Unto Him you will be brought back) after death and He will requite you each according to his works'.
وَٱلصَّافَّاتِ صَفَّا,"And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said regarding the interpretation of Allah's saying (By those who set the ranks in battle order): '(By those who set the ranks in battle order) Allah swore by the angels who are, in heaven, aligned in rows like the rows of the believers in prayer."
فَٱلزَّاجِرَاتِ زَجْراً,(And those who drive away with reproof) He also swore by the angels who drive away the clouds and bring them together.
فَٱلتَّٰلِيَٰتِ ذِكْراً,"(And those who read (the Word) for a reminder) He swore by the angels who recite the Qur'an; it is also said that He swore by the reciters of the Qur'an,"

صۤ وَٱلْقُرْآنِ ذِي ٱلذِّكْرِ,"And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said upon the interpretation of Allah's saying (Sad.): '(Sad.) He says: Sad by the Qur'an, i.e. repeat the Qur'an until you distinguish between faith and disbelief, the prophetic wont and blameworthy innovation, truthfulness and lying, the lawful and the unlawful, good and evil; it is also said that Sad stands for barring (sadd) from the guidance, i.e. the barring of the people of Mecca from the Truth and guidance; it is also said that it stands for Abu Jahl; and it is also said that it stands for truthful (sadiq) in his speech; and it is also said that Sad is one of Allah's names; and it is also said that it is an oath by which Allah swore (By the renowned Qur'an) by the Qur'an which possesses honour and clarity of exposition; it is an honour to those who believe in it and it is a clear exposition of the people of old as well as of future generations of people. Allah swore by the Qur'an,"
بَلِ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ فِي عِزَّةٍ وَشِقَاقٍ,"(Nay, but those who disbelieve) the disbelievers of Mecca (are in false pride and schism) dispute and enmity, and it is for this that Allah swore."

And they stopped until Allah destroyed all of them. This is because before this, upon fighting an enemy, they used to say: attack all together! (Manas! Manas!). Some would therefore survive and others die. But when they were defeated by the enemy they used to cry: flee! Flee! (Manasa! Manasa!), and so they used to flee all together from the battlefield. These were two different signs whenever they engaged in fighting either to attack or to flee from the enemy. When Allah wished to destroy them, the angels cried out to them: this is no context for attacking or fleeing."

أَءُنزِلَ عَلَيْهِ ٱلذِّكْرُ مِن بَيْنِنَا بَلْ هُمْ فَي شَكٍّ مِّن ذِكْرِي بَل لَّمَّا يَذُوقُواْ عَذَابِ,"(Hath the reminder been revealed unto him (alone) among us) has he been selected from among us to have prophethood and the Scripture? (Nay, but they) the disbelievers of Mecca (are in doubt concerning My reminder) concerning My Scripture and the prophethood of My Prophet; (nay but they have not yet tasted My doom) they have not tasted My chastisement, this is why they lie about Me."
أَمْ عِندَهُمْ خَزَآئِنُ رَحْمَةِ رَبِّكَ ٱلْعَزِيزِ ٱلْوَهَّابِ,"(Or are theirs the treasures of the mercy of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower) He says: or do they have in their hands prophethood and the Scriptures such that they bestow them upon whomever they wish, when He is the Mighty in retribution against whoever does not believe in Him, the Bestower Who has bestowed prophethood and the Scripture upon Muhammad (pbuh)?"
أَمْ لَهُم مُّلْكُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا فَلْيَرْتَقُواْ فِى ٱلأَسْبَابِ,"(Or is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them theirs?)

وَقَالُواْ رَبَّنَا عَجِّل لَّنَا قِطَّنَا قَبْلَ يَوْمِ ٱلْحِسَابِ,"(They say) i.e. the disbelievers of Mecca said upon hearing Allah's saying (Then, as for him who is given his record in his right hand, he will say: Take, read my book! … But as for him who is given his record in his left hand) [al-Haqqah: 69:19-25], they said: (Our Lord!) O our Lord! (Hasten on for us our fate) our records, they mean the registers of their deeds (before the Day of Reckoning) so that we know what is in them."
ٱصْبِر عَلَىٰ مَا يَقُولُونَ وَٱذْكُرْ عَبْدَنَا دَاوُودَ ذَا ٱلأَيْدِ إِنَّهُ أَوَّابٌ,"(Bear) O Muhammad (with what they say) in your rejection, (and remember Our bondman David) He says: mention to them the event of Our slave David, (lord of might) who had strength for our worship. (Lo! he was ever turning in repentance (towards Allah)) he was obedient, always engaged in the worship of Allah."

And the two went out from whence they came. (And David guessed) he knew and was certain (that We had tried him) because of the sin he committed, (and he sought forgiveness of his Lord) from his sin, (and he bowed himself and fell down prostrate and repented) feeling remorse for what he did."

Each one of these three had, on the Day of Badr, a dual with 'Ali, Hamzah and 'Ubaydah, respectively; 'Ali killed al-Walid Ibn 'Utbah, Hamzah killed 'Utbah Ibn Rabi'ah and 'Ubaydah killed Shaybah."

إِذْ قَالَ رَبُّكَ لِلْمَلاَئِكَةِ إِنِّي خَالِقٌ بَشَراً مِّن طِينٍ,"Then Allah explained the argument of the angels, saying: mention to them, O Muhammad (When thy Lord said unto the angels: lo! I am about to create a mortal out of mire) i.e. Adam,"
فَإِذَا سَوَّيْتُهُ وَنَفَخْتُ فِيهِ مِن رُّوحِي فَقَعُواْ لَهُ سَاجِدِينَ,"(And when I have fashioned him) and when I have gathered his creation (and breathed into him of My spirit) and placed in him My spirit, (then fall down before him prostrate) then prostrate before him,"
فَسَجَدَ ٱلْمَلاَئِكَةُ كُـلُّهُمْ أَجْمَعُونَ,"(The angels fell down prostrate, every one) before Adam."
إِلاَّ إِبْلِيسَ ٱسْتَكْبَرَ وَكَانَ مِنَ ٱلْكَافِرِينَ,"(Saving Iblis, he was scornful) he was too proud to prostrate before Adam (and became one of the disbelievers) because of disobeying Allah's command."
قَالَ يٰإِبْلِيسُ مَا مَنَعَكَ أَن تَسْجُدَ لِمَا خَلَقْتُ بِيَدَيَّ أَسْتَكْبَرْتَ أَمْ كُنتَ مِنَ ٱلْعَالِينَ,(He said) Allah said to him: (O Iblis!) O wicked one! (What hindereth thee from falling prostrate before that which I have created with both My hands) what prevented you from prostrating before that which I have shaped with My hands? (Art thou too proud) to prostrate before Adam (or art thou of the high) or are you of those who disobey My command?
قَالَ أَنَاْ خَيْرٌ مِّنْهُ خَلَقْتَنِي مِن نَّارٍ وَخَلَقْتَهُ مِن طِينٍ,"(He said: I am better than him. Thou createdst me of fire, whilst him Thou didst create of clay) and the Fire consumes clay; this is why I did not prostrate before him."
قَالَ فَٱخْرُجْ مِنْهَا فَإِنَّكَ رَجِيمٌ,"(He said) Allah said to him: (Go forth from hence) leave the angelic form; and it is also said this means: leave the earth, (for lo! thou art outcast) you are accursed and banished from My mercy and beneficence,"
وَإِنَّ عَلَيْكَ لَعْنَتِيۤ إِلَىٰ يَوْمِ ٱلدِّينِ,"(And lo! My curse) My wrath and chastisement; it is also said that Allah banished him to the isles of the sea and, hence, he goes to the land only in the form of a thief, wearing tattered clothes, and scaring people (is on you till the Day of Judgement) until the Day of Reckoning."
قَالَ رَبِّ فَأَنظِرْنِيۤ إِلَىٰ يَوْمِ يُبْعَثُونَ,(He said) Iblis said: (My Lord!) O my Lord! (Reprieve me) give me a respite (till the day when they are raised) from the graves. The wicked one wanted to escape the taste of death.
قَالَ فَإِنَّكَ مِنَ ٱلْمُنظَرِينَ,(He said) Allah said: (Lo! thou art of those reprieved) you are given a respite
إِلَىٰ يَوْمِ ٱلْوَقْتِ ٱلْمَعْلُومِ,(Until the day of the time appointed) until the first blow of the Trumpet.
قَالَ فَبِعِزَّتِكَ لأُغْوِيَنَّهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ,"(He said: Then, by Thy might) and favour, (I surely will beguile them every one) I will mislead all of them from Your religion and obedience,"
إِلاَّ عِبَادَكَ مِنْهُمُ ٱلْمُخْلَصِينَ,(Save Thy single minded slaves) save those slaves who are protected from me (among them) among the children of Adam.
قَالَ فَٱلْحَقُّ وَٱلْحَقَّ أَقُولُ,"(He said) Allah said to him: (The Truth is) I am the Truth, (and the Truth I speak,"
لأَمْلأَنَّ جَهَنَّمَ مِنكَ وَمِمَّن تَبِعَكَ مِنْهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ,"That I shall fill hell with thee) and with your offspring (and with such of them as follow thee) of the Children of Adam, (together) all those who obey your way."
قُلْ مَآ أَسْأَلُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ مِنْ أَجْرٍ وَمَآ أَنَآ مِنَ ٱلْمُتَكَلِّفِينَ,"(Say) O Muhammad, to the people of Mecca: (I ask of you no fee) no payment or provision (for this) for belief in Allah's divine Oneness and in the Qur'an, (and I am no impostor) and I am not inventing anything."
إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ ذِكْرٌ لِّلْعَالَمِينَ,(Lo! It) i.e. the Qur'an (is naught else than a reminder) an admonition (for all peoples) for the jinn and human beings.
وَلَتَعْلَمُنَّ نَبَأَهُ بَعْدَ حِينِ,(And ye will come in time to know the Truth thereof) you will know the Truth of the Qur'an and that which it contains of promises and threats after you believe; and it is also said: after death. Some came to know after they accepted faith: these are the believers; and some came to know after death and these are the disbelievers. Both came to know that what Allah said in the Qur'an is the Truth'.
تَنزِيلُ ٱلْكِتَابِ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ ٱلْعَزِيزِ ٱلْحَكِيمِ,"And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said regarding the interpretation of Allah's saying: (The revelation of the Scripture): '(The revelation of the Scripture is) He says: this Scripture is an address (from Allah, the Mighty) in retribution against those who disbelieve in Him, (the Wise) in His command and decree; He commanded that none should be worshipped except Him."
إِنَّآ أَنزَلْنَآ إِلَيْكَ ٱلْكِتَابَ بِٱلْحَقِّ فَٱعْبُدِ ٱللَّهَ مُخْلِصاً لَّهُ ٱلدِّينَ,"(Lo! We have revealed the Scripture unto thee (Muhammad)) We have sent Gabriel to you with the Scripture (with truth) not with falsehood; (so worship Allah, making religion pure for Him (only)) making worship and the profession of Allah's divine Oneness sincere to Him."
أَلاَ لِلَّهِ ٱلدِّينُ ٱلْخَالِصُ وَٱلَّذِينَ ٱتَّخَذُواْ مِن دُونِهِ أَوْلِيَآءَ مَا نَعْبُدُهُمْ إِلاَّ لِيُقَرِّبُونَآ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ زُلْفَىۤ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَحْكُمُ بَيْنَهُمْ فِي مَا هُمْ فِيهِ يَخْتَلِفُونَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لاَ يَهْدِي مَنْ هُوَ كَاذِبٌ كَـفَّارٌ,"(Surely Pure religion is) sincerity in religion is enjoined upon people (for Allah only. And those who choose) and those who worship (protecting friends) deities: al-Lat, al-'Uzza and Manat (beside Him) beside Allah, i.e. the disbelievers of Mecca ((say): We worship them only that they may bring us near unto Allah) near to Allah in rank and intercession. (Lo! Allah will judge between them) and the believers on the Day of Judgement (concerning that wherein) in the matter of religion (they differ) they contravene. (Lo! Allah guideth not) to his religion (him who is a liar) about Allah, (an ingrate) and disbelieves in Allah; the reference here is to the Jews, Christians, the Banu Malih, the Magians and the Arab idolaters."
لَّوْ أَرَادَ ٱللَّهُ أَن يَتَّخِذَ وَلَداً لاَّصْطَفَىٰ مِمَّا يَخْلُقُ مَا يَشَآءُ سُبْحَانَهُ هُوَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْوَاحِدُ ٱلْقَهَّارُ,"(If Allah had willed to choose a son) from among the angels or human beings as claimed the Jews, Christians and the Banu Malih, (He could have chosen what he would of that which He hath created) in Paradise; and it is said: from among the angels. (Be He glorified!) Allah exonerated Himself. (He is Allah, the One) He has no son or partner, (the Absolute) the All-Conquering over His creation."

(He maketh night to succeed day) He reduces the night such that the day is longer than the night, (and He maketh day to succeed night) and prolongs the night such that the night is longer than the day, (and He constraineth the sun and the moon to give service) and He makes the sun and moon subservient to the Children of Adam, (each) i.e. the sun and the moon, the day and night (running on for an appointed term) for an appointed time. (Is not He the Mighty) He Who does this is the Mighty in retribution against those who disbelieve in Him, (the Forgiver) of those who believe in Him?"
خَلَقَكُمْ مِّن نَّفْسٍ وَاحِدَةٍ ثُمَّ جَعَلَ مِنْهَا زَوْجَهَا وَأَنزَلَ لَكُمْ مِّنَ ٱلأَنْعَامِ ثَمَانِيَةَ أَزْوَاجٍ يَخْلُقُكُمْ فِي بُطُونِ أُمَّهَاتِكُـمْ خَلْقاً مِّن بَعْدِ خَلْقٍ فِي ظُلُمَاتٍ ثَلاَثٍ ذَٰلِكُمُ ٱللَّهُ رَبُّكُمْ لَهُ ٱلْمُلْكُ لاۤ إِلَـٰهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ فَأَنَّىٰ تُصْرَفُونَ,"(He created you from one being) from the being of Adam alone, (then from that (being)) i.e. from Adam (He made its mate) Eve, He created her from one of Adam's shorter ribs; (and He hath provided for you of cattle eight kinds) of sheep: a male and a female; of goat: a male and a female; of camel: a male and a female; of bovines: a male and a female. (He created you in the wombs of your mothers, creation after creation) a state after another: a sperm drop then a blood clot then a piece of flesh and then bones, (in a threefold gloom) the darkness of the belly, the darkness of the womb and the darkness of the placenta. (Such is Allah, your Lord) Who does this. (His is the Sovereignty) which is perpetual and never ending. (There is no God save Him) there is no Creator or Fashioner except Him. (How then are ye turned away) How then do you lie against Him and ascribe partners to Him?"

(No laden soul will bear another's load) no soul will bear the sins of another; it is also said that this means: no soul will be taken to task for the sins of another soul, for each soul will be taken to task for its own sins; and it is also said that this means: no soul will be punished for no crime. (Then unto your Lord is your return) after death; (and He will tell you) on the Day of Judgement (what ye used to do) and say in the life of this world. (Lo! He knoweth what is in the breasts (of men)) of good and evil."

(Then, when He grants him) then, when He changes into (a boon from Him he forgeteth that for which he cried unto Him before) before the blessing, (and setteth up rivals) and equals (to Allah that he may beguile (men) from His way) from His religion and obedience. (Say) to Abu Jahl: (Take pleasure in thy disbelief) dwell in your disbelief (a while) a little in the life of this world. (Lo! thou art of the owners of the Fire) you are of the inhabitants of the Fire."

(Say) to them, O Muhammad: (Are those who know) Allah's divine Oneness and Allah's commands and prohibitions, i.e. Abu Bakr and his fellow believers (equal) in reward and acts of obedience (with those who know not) Allah's divine Oneness or Allah's commands and prohibitions, i.e. Abu Jahl and his host? (But only men of understanding) only those possessed of intellect among people (will pay heed) will take admonition from the similitudes of the Qur'an."

(For those who do good) for those who believe in Allah's divine Oneness (in this world there is good) they will have the Garden on the Day of Judgement, (and Allah's earth) the land of Medina (is spacious) is safe from the enemy, so travel to it; this address was before the Hijrah. (Verily the steadfast) in the face of misfortunes (will be paid their wages) their rewards (without stint) without measure or delay."

وَأُمِرْتُ لأَنْ أَكُونَ أَوَّلَ ٱلْمُسْلِمِينَ,(And I am commanded) in the Qur'an (to be the first of those who surrender (unto Him)) the first of those who accept Islam.

ضَرَبَ ٱللَّهُ مَثَلاً رَّجُلاً فِيهِ شُرَكَآءُ مُتَشَاكِسُونَ وَرَجُلاً سَلَماً لِّرَجُلٍ هَلْ يَسْتَوِيَانِ مَثَلاً ٱلْحَمْدُ للَّهِ بَلْ أَكْثَرُهُمْ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ,"(Allah coineth a similitude: A man in relation to whom are several part owners, quarrelling) one ordering him to do something while the other forbidding him from doing the same; such is the similitude of a man who worships several deities, (and a man belonging wholly to one man) this is like the believer who worships only Allah and surrenders his religion and works to Allah alone. (Are the two equal in similitude) are the disbeliever and believer equal? (Praise be to Allah) divine Oneness and praise belong to Allah! (But most of them know not) the similitudes of the Qur'an."
إِنَّكَ مَيِّتٌ وَإِنَّهُمْ مَّيِّتُونَ,"(Lo! thou) O Muhammad (wilt die, and lo! They) i.e. the disbelievers of Mecca (will die;"

فَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّن كَذَبَ علَى ٱللَّهِ وَكَذَّبَ بِٱلصِّدْقِ إِذْ جَآءَهُ أَلَيْسَ فِي جَهَنَّمَ مَثْوًى لِّلْكَافِرِينَ,"(And who doth greater wrong) in his state of disbelief (than he who telleth a lie against Allah) than the one who rejects the Qur'an and claims that Allah has a son or partner; the reference here is to Abu Jahl and his host, (and denieth the Truth) the Qur'an and belief in Allah's divine Oneness (when it reacheth him) when Muhammad brought it to him? (Will not the home) and abode (of disbelievers) Abu Jahl and his host (be in hell?"
وَٱلَّذِي جَآءَ بِٱلصِّدْقِ وَصَدَّقَ بِهِ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْمُتَّقُونَ,"And whoso bringeth the Truth) the Qur'an and the profession of Allah's divine Oneness, i.e. Muhammad (pbuh) (and believeth therein) and those who believe in him, i.e. Abu Bakr and his fellow believers. (Such are the dutiful) such are those who ward off disbelief, idolatry and indecent acts."
لَهُم مَّا يَشَآءُونَ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ ذَلِكَ جَزَآءُ ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,(They shall have what they will) what they desire (of their Lord's bounty) in Paradise. (That) honour (is the reward of the good) of the ones who believes in Allah's divine Oneness:
لِيُكَـفِّرَ ٱللَّهُ عَنْهُمْ أَسْوَأَ ٱلَّذِي عَمِلُواْ وَيَجْزِيَهُمْ أَجْرَهُمْ بِأَحْسَنِ ٱلَّذِي كَـانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ,"(That Allah will remit from them the worst of what they did) the vilest of their works, (and will pay them for reward the best they used to do) of good."
أَلَيْسَ ٱللَّهُ بِكَافٍ عَبْدَهُ وَيُخَوِّفُونَكَ بِٱلَّذِينَ مِن دُونِهِ وَمَن يُضْـلِلِ ٱللَّهُ فَمَا لَهُ مِنْ هَـادٍ,"(Will not Allah defend His slave) i.e. Muhammad (pbuh); it is also said it is Khalid Ibn al-Walid; i.e. Allah will defend him from that which they plot against him? (Yet they would frighten thee) O Muhammad (with those beside Him) i.e. with al-Lat, al-'Uzza and Manat; they say to you: do not vilify them or curse them lets they bewitch you. (He whom Allah sendeth astray) from His religion, (for him there is no guide) to lead him to Allah's religion; the reference here is to Abu Jahl and his host."
وَمَن يَهْدِ ٱللَّهُ فَمَا لَهُ مِن مُّضِلٍّ أَلَيْسَ ٱللَّهُ بِعَزِيزٍ ذِي ٱنتِقَامٍ,"(And he whom Allah guideth) to His religion, (for him there can be no misleader) from His religion; the reference here is to Abu Bakr and his fellow believers; it is also said that the reference is to the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh). (Is not Allah Mighty) in His sovereignty and dominion, (Able to Requite) Able to take revenge on those who disbelieve in Him?"
وَلَئِن سَأَلْتَهُمْ مَّنْ خَلَقَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضَ لَيَقُولُنَّ ٱللَّهُ قُلْ أَفَرَأَيْتُم مَّا تَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ إِنْ أَرَادَنِيَ ٱللَّهُ بِضُرٍّ هَلْ هُنَّ كَاشِفَاتُ ضُرِّهِ أَوْ أَرَادَنِي بِرَحْمَةٍ هَلْ هُنَّ مُمْسِكَاتُ رَحْمَتِهِ قُلْ حَسْبِيَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ يَتَوَكَّـلُ ٱلْمُتَوَكِّلُونَ,"(And verily, if thou shouldst ask them) i.e. the disbelievers of Mecca: (Who created the heavens and the earth? They) the disbelievers of Mecca (will say: Allah) created them. (Say) to them, O Muhammad: (Bethink you then of those ye worship beside Allah) al-Lat, al-'Uzza and Manat, (if Allah willed some hurt) hardship or trial (for me, could they) i.e. al-Lat, al-'Uzza and Manat (remove from me His hurt) His hardship and trial; (or if He willed some mercy) well-being (for me, could they) i.e. al-Lat, al-'Uzza and Manat (restrain His mercy) from me, such that you ask me to worship them? (Say) O Muhammad: (Allah is my all) I trust in Allah. (In Him do (all) the trusting put their trust) it is also said that this means: the believers should put their trust in Allah."

Act in your manner) act according to your religion and plot in your home for my destruction. (I too am acting) to destroy you. (Thus ye will come to know) this is a threat to them from Allah"

(And thou art not a warder) a custodian (over them) over the disbelievers of Mecca such that you are taken to task for their denial."

أَمِ ٱتَّخَذُواْ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ شُفَعَآءَ قُلْ أَوَلَوْ كَـانُواْ لاَ يَمْلِكُونَ شَيْئاً وَلاَ يَعْقِلُونَ,"(Or choose they) or do the disbelievers of Mecca worship (intercessors) deities in order that the latter intercede for them (other than Allah? Say) to them, O Muhammad: (What! Even though they have power over nothing) what! Even though they have no power of intercession (and have no intelligence) nor know what intercession is? And if they do not know what intercession is, how are they going to intercede?"
قُل لِلَّهِ ٱلشَّفَاعَةُ جَمِيعاً لَّهُ مُلْكُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ ثُمَّ إِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ,(Say: Unto Allah belongeth all intercession) intercession is in the Hands of Allah on the Day of Judgement. (His is the Sovereignty) the stores (of the heavens) rain (and the earth) vegetation. (And afterward unto Him ye will be brought back) in the Hereafter and will reward each according to his works.
وَإِذَا ذُكِرَ ٱللَّهُ وَحْدَهُ ٱشْمَأَزَّتْ قُلُوبُ ٱلَّذِينَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱلآخِرَةِ وَإِذَا ذُكِرَ ٱلَّذِينَ مِن دُونِهِ إِذَا هُمْ يَسْتَبْشِرُونَ,"(And when Allah alone is mentioned) when it is said to them say: there is no deity except Allah, (the hearts of those who believe not in the Hereafter) in resurrection after death (are repelled, and when those (whom they worship) beside Him) i.e. al-Lat, al-'Uzza and Manat (are mentioned, behold! they are glad) for the mention of their deities."
قُلِ ٱللَّهُمَّ فَاطِرَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ عَالِمَ ٱلْغَيْبِ وَٱلشَّهَادَةِ أَنتَ تَحْكُمُ بَيْنَ عِبَادِكَ فِي مَا كَانُواْ فِيهِ يَخْتَلِفُونَ,"(Say: O Allah) lead us to that which is good!

وَلَوْ أَنَّ لِلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ مَا فِي ٱلأَرْضِ جَمِيعاً وَمِثْلَهُ مَعَهُ لاَفْتَدَوْاْ بِهِ مِن سُوۤءِ ٱلْعَذَابِ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ وَبَدَا لَهُمْ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ مَا لَمْ يَكُونُواْ يَحْتَسِبُونَ,"(And though those who do wrong) the idolaters (possess all that is in the earth, and therewith as much again) double of that, (they verily will seek to ransom themselves therewith on the Day of Resurrection from the awful doom) from the severe chastisement; (and there will appear unto them, from their Lord) from their Lord's chastisement, (that wherewith they never reckoned) that which they never thought."
وَبَدَا لَهُمْ سَيِّئَاتُ مَا كَـسَبُواْ وَحَاقَ بِهِم مَّا كَانُواْ بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِئُونَ,"(And the evils that they earned) their evil works (will appear unto them, and that whereat they used to scoff) the prophets and Scriptures that they used to mock; and it is said the torment that they used to scoff (will surround them) i.e. the torment will visit them."
فَإِذَا مَسَّ ٱلإِنسَانَ ضُرٌّ دَعَانَا ثُمَّ إِذَا خَوَّلْنَاهُ نِعْمَةً مِّنَّا قَالَ إِنَّمَآ أُوتِيتُهُ عَلَىٰ عِلْمٍ بَلْ هِيَ فِتْنَةٌ وَلَـٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَهُمْ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ,"(Now when hurt) hardship (toucheth a man) the disbelieving man (he crieth unto Us) to remove the hardship from him, (and afterward when We have granted him) then when We have substituted it for him into (a boon from Us, he saith: Only by force of knowledge I obtained it) I obtained this wealth only because Allah knows I am righteous and good. (Nay, but it is a test) it is a trial and plot against them. (But most of them) all of them (know not) this."

فَأَصَابَهُمْ سَيِّئَاتُ مَا كَسَبُواْ وَٱلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ مِنْ هَـٰؤُلاَءِ سَيُصِيبُهُمْ سَيِّئَاتُ مَا كَسَبُواْ وَمَا هُمْ بِمُعْجِزِينَ,"(But the evils that they earned) the chastisement for what they said, did and amassed of wealth in the life of the world (smote them; and such of these) among the disbelievers of Mecca (as do wrong) ascribe partners to Allah, (the evils that they earn will smite them) the punishment for what they did will touch them, just as it touched those before them; (they cannot escape) Allah's torment."
أَوَلَمْ يَعْلَمُوۤاْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَبْسُطُ ٱلرِّزْقَ لِمَن يَشَآءُ وَيَقْدِرُ إِنَّ فِي ذَلِكَ لآيَاتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يُؤْمِنُونَ,"(Know they not) i.e. the disbelievers of Mecca (that Allah enlargeth providence for whom He will) that Allah expands wealth to whomever He will as a lure to perdition, (and straiteneth it (for whom He will)) out of care for them.

وَأَنِـيبُوۤاْ إِلَىٰ رَبِّكُمْ وَأَسْلِمُواْ لَهُ مِن قَبْلِ أَن يَأْتِيَكُمُ ٱلْعَذَابُ ثُمَّ لاَ تُنصَرُونَ,"(Turn unto Him repentant) from disbelief, (and surrender unto Him) and believe in Him and obey Him, (before there come unto you the doom, when ye cannot be helped) you will not be spared from Allah's torment. This verse was revealed about Wahshiyy and his believing brothers."
وَٱتَّبِعُـوۤاْ أَحْسَنَ مَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكُم مِّن رَّبِّكُـمْ مِّن قَبْلِ أَن يَأْتِيَكُـمُ ٱلْعَذَابُ بَغْتَةً وَأَنتُمْ لاَ تَشْعُرُونَ,"Then Allah said: (And follow the better (guidance) of that which is revealed unto you from your Lord) i.e. the Qur'an; make lawful that which it states to be lawful and unlawful that which it states to be unlawful, and act upon its clear verses and believe in its unclear verses, (before the doom cometh on you suddenly when ye know not) its coming,"
أَن تَقُولَ نَفْسٌ يٰحَسْرَتَا عَلَىٰ مَا فَرَّطَتُ فِي جَنبِ ٱللَّهِ وَإِن كُنتُ لَمِنَ ٱلسَّاخِرِينَ,"(Lest any soul should say) so that no soul should say: (Alas, my grief) I am remorseful (that I was unmindful of Allah) that I have left the obedience of Allah, (and I was indeed among the scoffers) and I was indeed among those who mocked the Scripture and Messenger!"
أَوْ تَقُولَ لَوْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ هَدَانِي لَكُـنتُ مِنَ ٱلْمُتَّقِينَ,(Or should say) and that it will not say: (if Allah had but guided me) if Allah had showed me faith (I should have been among the dutiful) I would have been among those who believe in Allah's divine Oneness!
أَوْ تَقُولَ حِينَ تَرَى ٱلْعَذَابَ لَوْ أَنَّ لِي كَـرَّةً فَأَكُونَ مِنَ ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,"(Or should say) and so that it will not say, (when it seeth the doom: Oh, that I had but a second chance) to return to the life of this world (that I might be among the righteous) among those who believe in Allah's divine Oneness!"
بَلَىٰ قَدْ جَآءَتْكَ آيَاتِي فَكَذَّبْتَ بِهَا وَٱسْتَكْبَرْتَ وَكُنتَ مِنَ ٱلْكَافِرِينَ,"Allah will say to them: (Nay, for My revelations) My Scripture and Messenger (came unto thee, but thou didst deny them) you denied the Scripture and Messenger (and were scornful) you were too proud to believe (and were among the disbelievers) you were with the disbelievers, following their religion."
وَيَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ تَرَى ٱلَّذِينَ كَذَبُواْ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ وُجُوهُهُم مُّسْوَدَّةٌ أَلَيْسَ فِي جَهَنَّمَ مَثْوًى لِّلْمُتَكَبِّرِينَ,"(And on the Day of Resurrection thou (Muhammad) seest those who lied concerning Allah) regarding 'Uzayr, Jesus and the angels, when they claimed that the angels were Allah's daughters while 'Uzayr and Jesus were his sons (with their faces blackened) and their eyes turned blue.

Knowing that both Hands of Allah, Exalted is He, are right. (Glorified is He) Allah exonerated Himself from the claim of the Jews (and High Exalted) He is free and far elevated (from all that they ascribe as partner (unto Him)) of partners."

(Then it is blown a second time) which is the blowing of the Resurrection. This will happen 40 years after the first blow of the Trumpet and then the sky will rain something like men's sperm drops, (and behold them standing) from the grave (waiting) for what they will be told!"

وَقَالَ فَرْعَوْنُ يٰهَامَانُ ٱبْنِ لِي صَرْحاً لَّعَـلِّيۤ أَبْلُغُ ٱلأَسْبَابَ,"(And Pharaoh said) to his aid: (O Haman! Build for me a tower that haply I may reach the roads) that I may climb up to the gates,"
أَسْبَابَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ فَأَطَّلِعَ إِلَىٰ إِلَـٰهِ مُوسَىٰ وَإِنِّي لأَظُنُّهُ كَاذِباً وَكَـذَلِكَ زُيِّنَ لِفِرْعَوْنَ سُوۤءُ عَمَلِهِ وَصُدَّ عَنِ ٱلسَّبِيلِ وَمَا كَـيْدُ فِرْعَوْنَ إِلاَّ فِي تَبَابٍ,"(The roads of the heavens) the gates of heaven, (and may look upon) and may see (the God of Moses) whom he claims is in heaven and has sent him to me, (though verily I think him a liar) there is no God in heaven. But he got too busy with Moses and the tower was not built. (Thus was the evil that he did made fair-seeming unto Pharaoh, and he was debarred from the (right) way) and he was prevented from the Truth and guidance. (The plot of Pharaoh ended but in ruin) in disarray."
وَقَالَ ٱلَّذِيۤ آمَنَ يٰقَوْمِ ٱتَّبِعُونِ أَهْدِكُـمْ سَبِيـلَ ٱلرَّشَـادِ,(And he who believed) i.e. Ezekiel (said: O my people! Follow me) follow my religion. (I will show you the way of right conduct) I will invite you to the Truth and guidance.
يٰقَوْمِ إِنَّمَا هَـٰذِهِ ٱلْحَيَاةُ ٱلدُّنْيَا مَتَاعٌ وَإِنَّ ٱلآخِرَةَ هِيَ دَارُ ٱلْقَـرَارِ,"(O my people! Lo! this life of the world is but a passing comfort) like the comfort of your homes; it does not last, (and lo! the Hereafter) i.e. the Garden, (that is the enduring home) that is the everlasting abode which will never perish."
مَنْ عَمِـلَ سَـيِّئَةً فَلاَ يُجْزَىٰ إِلاَّ مِثْلَهَا وَمَنْ عَمِـلَ صَالِحاً مِّن ذَكَـرٍ أَوْ أُنْثَىٰ وَهُوَ مُؤْمِنٌ فَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ يَدْخُلُونَ ٱلْجَنَّةَ يُرْزَقُونَ فِيهَا بِغَيْرِ حِسَابٍ,"(Whoso doeth an ill deed) while being an idolater, (he will be repaid the like thereof) in the Fire, (while whoso doeth right) sincerely, (whether male or female) whether they are men or women, (and is a believer) sincere in his faith, ((all) such will enter the Garden, where they will be nourished without stint) without measure or limit."
وَيٰقَوْمِ مَا لِيۤ أَدْعُوكُـمْ إِلَى ٱلنَّجَاةِ وَتَدْعُونَنِيۤ إِلَى ٱلنَّارِ,"(And, O my people! What aileth me that I call you unto deliverance) unto Allah's divine Oneness-this is also the saying of Ezekiel-(when ye call me unto the Fire) while you are calling me to the deeds of the dwellers of the Fire: i.e. to idolatry?"
تَدْعُونَنِي لأَكْـفُرَ بِٱللَّهِ وَأُشْرِكَ بِهِ مَا لَيْسَ لِي بِهِ عِلْمٌ وَأَنَاْ أَدْعُوكُمْ إِلَى ٱلْعَزِيزِ ٱلْغَفَّارِ,"(Ye call me to disbelieve in Allah and ascribe unto Him as partners that whereof I have no knowledge) they are His partners because I know for certain that He has no partner, (while I call you unto the Mighty) while I call you unto the divine Oneness of the Mighty in retribution against those who disbelieve in Him, (the Forgiver) of those who believe in Him."
لاَ جَرَمَ أَنَّمَا تَدْعُونَنِيۤ إِلَيْهِ لَيْسَ لَهُ دَعْوَةٌ فِي ٱلدُّنْيَا وَلاَ فِي ٱلآخِرَةِ وَأَنَّ مَرَدَّنَآ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ وَأَنَّ ٱلْمُسْرِفِينَ هُمْ أَصْحَابُ ٱلنَّارِ,"(Assuredly that whereunto ye call me hath no claim) no power (in the world or in the Hereafter, and our return will be unto Allah) after we die, (and the prodigals) the idolaters (will be owners of the Fire) the inhabitants of the Fire."

(I confide) I consign (my cause unto Allah) trusting in Him. (Lo! Allah is Seer of (His) slaves) He sees those who believe in Him and those who do not.
فَوقَاهُ ٱللَّهُ سَيِّئَاتِ مَا مَكَـرُواْ وَحَاقَ بِآلِ فِرْعَوْنَ سُوۤءُ ٱلْعَذَابِ,"(So Allah warded off from him the evils which they plotted) Allah drove them away from him when they wanted to kill him, (while a dreadful doom) a severe punishment (encompassed Pharaoh's folk) visited Pharaoh and his folk, i.e. they drowned."
ٱلنَّارُ يُعْرَضُونَ عَلَيْهَا غُدُوّاً وَعَشِيّاً وَيَوْمَ تَقُومُ ٱلسَّاعَةُ أَدْخِلُوۤاْ آلَ فِرْعَوْنَ أَشَدَّ ٱلْعَذَابِ,(The Fire; they are exposed to it) He says: the spirits of the folk of Pharaoh will be exposed to the Fire (morning and evening) until the Day of Judgement; (and on the day when the Hour upriseth) which is the Day of Judgement ((it is said)) Allah will say to the angels: (Cause Pharaoh's folk to enter the most awful doom) the bottom of hell.
وَإِذْ يَتَحَآجُّونَ فِي ٱلنَّـارِ فَيَقُولُ ٱلضُّعَفَاءُ لِلَّذِينَ ٱسْتَكْـبَرُوۤاْ إِنَّا كُنَّا لَكُمْ تَبَعاً فَهَلْ أَنتُم مُّغْنُونَ عَنَّا نَصِيباً مِّنَ ٱلنَّارِ,"(And when they) the leaders and the followers (wrangle in the Fire, the weak) the followers (say unto those who were proud) too proud to accept faith, i.e. the leaders: (Lo! we were a following unto you) we followed your religion in the life of the world: (will ye therefore rid us of a portion of the Fire) will therefore bear for us some of the punishment of the Fire?"
قَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱسْتَكْبَرُوۤاْ إِنَّا كُلٌّ فِيهَآ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ قَدْ حَكَمَ بَيْنَ ٱلْعِبَادِ,"(Those who were proud) to accept faith, i.e. the leaders (say) to their followers: (Lo! we are all (together)) the worshipped and the worshippers, the leaders and the followers (herein) in the Fire. (Lo!

وَقَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ فِي ٱلنَّارِ لِخَزَنَةِ جَهَنَّمَ ٱدْعُواْ رَبَّكُمْ يُخَفِّفْ عَنَّا يَوْماً مِّنَ ٱلْعَذَابِ,"(And those in the Fire say) when the Fire becomes too intense for them, and their patience wanes and they lose hope in their prayers (unto the guards of hell) the angels of hell: (Entreat your Lord that He relieve us of a day of the torment) the equivalent of a day of the life of the world of torment."
قَالُوۤاْ أَوَلَمْ تَكُ تَأْتِيكُمْ رُسُلُكُمْ بِٱلْبَيِّنَاتِ قَالُواْ بَلَىٰ قَالُواْ فَٱدْعُواْ وَمَا دُعَاءُ ٱلْكَافِرِينَ إِلاَّ فِي ضَلاَلٍ,"(They say) i.e. the angels of hell say to the disbelievers: (Came not your messengers unto you with clear proofs) with commands and prohibitions and signs and did they not convey the message entrusted to them by Allah? (They say: Yea, verily) they conveyed the message to us, (They say) the angels of hell will say to them in mockery: (Then do ye pray, although the prayer of disbelievers) in the Fire (is in vain) it is also said that this means: although the worship of the disbelievers in the life of the world is but in error."
إِنَّا لَنَنصُرُ رُسُلَنَا وَٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ فِي ٱلْحَيَاةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَيَوْمَ يَقُومُ ٱلأَشْهَادُ,"(Lo!

(So take thou refuge in Allah) O Muhammad, from the sedition of the anti-Christ. (Lo! He, only He, is the Hearer) of what the Jews say, (the Seer) He sees them and sees their works just as He sees the anti-Christ and his coming."

(Say) to them, O Muhammad: (For those who believe) Abu Bakr and his fellow Muslims (it) i.e. the Qur'an (is a guidance) from error (and a healing) it removes the blindness which is in the hearts of people; (and as for those who disbelieve) in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an, i.e. Abu Jahl and his host, (there is a deafness in their ears, and it) i.e. the Qur'an (is blindness for them) a proof against them.

They) the Jews, Christians and idolaters (are in hopeless doubt concerning it) are in manifest doubt concerning the Qur'an; it is also said: concerning the Scripture of Moses."

وَٱلَّذِينَ يُحَآجُّونَ فِي ٱللَّهِ مِن بَعْدِ مَا ٱسَتُجِيبَ لَهُ حُجَّتُهُمْ دَاحِضَةٌ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ وَعَلَيْهِمْ غَضَبٌ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ شَدِيدٌ,"Allah then commanded fighting, saying: (And those who argue concerning Allah) i.e. the Jews and Christians (after He hath been acknowledged) in the Scripture; it is also said that this refers to the idolaters after they answered on the day of the covenant, (their argument has no weight) their argument is void (with their Lord, and wrath is upon them and theirs will be an awful doom) the most severe torment."
ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِيۤ أَنزَلَ ٱلْكِتَابَ بِٱلْحَقِّ وَٱلْمِيزَانَ وَمَا يُدْرِيكَ لَعَلَّ ٱلسَّاعَةَ قَرِيبٌ,"(Allah it is who hath revealed the Scripture) He sent Gabriel with the Qur'an (with truth) to explain the Truth and falsehood, (and the Balance) and exposited therein justice. (How canst thou know) O Muhammad? (It may be that the Hour is nigh) it may be that the Hour is coming soon."
يَسْتَعْجِلُ بِهَا ٱلَّذِينَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِهَا وَٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ مُشْفِقُونَ مِنْهَا وَيَعْلَمُونَ أَنَّهَا ٱلْحَقُّ أَلاَ إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يُمَارُونَ فَي ٱلسَّاعَةِ لَفِي ضَلاَلٍ بَعِيدٍ,"(Those who believe not therein) in the coming of the Hour, i.e. Abu Jahl and his host (seek to hasten it, while those who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) in the Qur'an and in the coming of the Hour, i.e. Abu Bakr and his fellow believers (are fearful of it) are fearful of the coming of the Hour, its horrors and terrors (and know that it) i.e. the coming of the Hour (is the Truth) it will happen. (Are not they who dispute, in doubt concerning the Hour, far astray) from the Truth and guidance?"
ٱللَّهُ لَطِيفٌ بِعِبَادِهِ يَرْزُقُ مَن يَشَآءُ وَهُوَ ٱلْقَوِيُّ ٱلْعَزِيزُ,"(Allah is gracious unto His slaves) the pious as well as the sinful; it is also said that this means: His knowledge is gracious with His slaves, both the pious and sinful among them. (He provideth for whom He will) He expands the wealth of whomever He will. (And He is the Strong) in providing the sustenance of the slaves, (the Mighty) in retribution against those who do not believe."
مَن كَانَ يُرِيدُ حَرْثَ ٱلآخِرَةِ نَزِدْ لَهُ فِي حَرْثِهِ وَمَن كَانَ يُرِيدُ حَرْثَ ٱلدُّنْيَا نُؤْتِهِ مِنْهَا وَمَا لَهُ فِي ٱلآخِرَةِ مِن نَّصِيبٍ,"(Whoso desireth the harvest of the Hereafter) the reward of the Hereafter through his works for Allah, (We give him increase in its harvest) We give him increase in his reward; it is also said: We give him increase in his strength, activity and reward in the Hereafter. (And Whoso desireth the harvest of the world) and whoever desires the reward of the life of the world through the works that Allah has made obligatory upon him, (We give him thereof) We give him of the life of the world and drive away from him some of its hardship, (and he hath no portion) he has no reward (in the Hereafter) in Paradise because he did not work for Allah."
أَمْ لَهُمْ شُرَكَاءُ شَرَعُواْ لَهُمْ مِّنَ ٱلدِّينِ مَا لَمْ يَأْذَن بِهِ ٱللَّهُ وَلَوْلاَ كَلِمَةُ ٱلْفَصْلِ لَقُضِيَ بَيْنَهُمْ وَإِنَّ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,"(Or have they) i.e. the disbelievers of Mecca (partners (of Allah)) deities (who have made lawful for them in religion that which Allah allowed not) that which Allah did not command the disbelievers: Abu Jahl and his host? (And but for a decisive word (gone forth already)) to delay the punishment of this nation, (it would have been judged between them) they would have been destroyed. (Lo! for wrong-doers) for disbelievers (is a painful doom."

(This) Paradise (is the great preferment) is the great bounty."
ذَلِكَ ٱلَّذِي يُبَشِّرُ ٱللَّهُ عِبَادَهُ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ قُل لاَّ أَسْأَلُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ أَجْراً إِلاَّ ٱلْمَوَدَّةَ فِي ٱلْقُرْبَىٰ وَمَن يَقْتَرِفْ حَسَنَةً نَّزِدْ لَهُ فِيهَا حُسْناً إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ شَكُورٌ,"(This) bounty (it is which Allah announceth unto His bondmen) in the life of the world (who believe) in Muhammad and the Qur'an (and do good works) between them and their Lord. (Say) O Muhammad, to your Companions; and it is said: to the people of Mecca: (I ask of you no fee) no payment (therefore, save loving kindness among kinsfolk) except that you treat kindly my kinsfolk after me; it is also said this means: except that you draw closer to Allah through the profession of Allah's divine Oneness, according to al-Hasan al-Basri; and according to al-Farra' this means: draw closer to Allah by means of repentance. (And whoso scoreth a good deed we add unto its good for him) nine times. (Lo! Allah is Forgiving) He forgives the one who repents, (Responsive) He is thankful for very little and rewards for it abundantly."
أَمْ يَقُولُونَ ٱفْتَرَىٰ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ كَذِباً فَإِن يَشَإِ ٱللَّهُ يَخْتِمْ عَلَىٰ قَلْبِكَ وَيَمْحُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْبَاطِلَ وَيُحِقُّ ٱلْحَقَّ بِكَلِمَاتِهِ إِنَّهُ عَلِيمٌ بِذَاتِ ٱلصُّدُورِ,"(Or say they) in fact they do say: (He hath invented) Muhammad has invented (a lie concerning Allah?) The Prophet (pbuh) was saddened because of this, and so Allah, glorious and Exalted is He, said: (If Allah willed, He could have sealed) tied (thy heart (against them). And Allah will wipe out the lie) Allah will destroy idolatry and all the idolaters (and will vindicate the Truth by His words) and will manifest the religion of Islam through His enhancement. (Lo! He is aware of what is hidden in the breasts (of men)) He knows what is in people's hearts whether it is good or evil."

(And as for disbelievers) Abu Jahl and his host, (theirs will be an awful doom)."
وَلَوْ بَسَطَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلرِّزْقَ لِعِبَادِهِ لَبَغَوْاْ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَلَـٰكِن يُنَزِّلُ بِقَدَرٍ مَّا يَشَآءُ إِنَّهُ بِعِبَادِهِ خَبِيرٌ بَصِيرٌ,"(And if Allah were to enlarge the provision for His slaves) if Allah were to give abundant wealth to His slaves (they would surely rebel) they would surely transgress and become too arrogant (in the earth, but He sendeth down) but He enlarges (by measure as He wills) for whomever He will.

(Lo! Herein) in that which I have mentioned regarding ships (verily are signs) and lessons (for every steadfast) in acts of obedience (grateful (heart)) for Allah's blessings.
أَوْ يُوبِقْهُنَّ بِمَا كَسَبُوا وَيَعْفُ عَن كَثِيرٍ,(Or he causeth them to perish) i.e. the ships (on account of that which they have earned) on account of the sins of their people. (And He forgiveth much) He does not take them to task for it.
وَيَعْلَمَ ٱلَّذِينَ يُجَادِلُونَ فِيۤ آيَاتِنَا مَا لَهُمْ مِّن مَّحِيصٍ,(And that those who argue concerning Our revelations) those who disbelieve in Muhammad (pbuh) (may know they have no refuge) or escape from Allah's chastisement.

That) patience and forgiveness, (verily, is (of) the steadfast heart of things) verily is the best of matters; it is also said this means: of the most resolute of matters. The verses from (And those who shun the worst of sins and indecencies…) to (…lo! that, verily, is (of) the steadfast heart of things) were revealed about Abu Bakr and his fellow believer 'Amr Ibn Ghazyah al-Ansari in relation to a dispute which happened between the two. Al-Ansari had, in this dispute, abused Abu Bakr al-Siddiq."
وَمَن يُضْلِلِ ٱللَّهُ فَمَا لَهُ مِن وَلِيٍّ مِّن بَعْدِهِ وَتَرَى ٱلظَّالِمِينَ لَمَّا رَأَوُاْ ٱلْعَذَابَ يَقُولُونَ هَلْ إِلَىٰ مَرَدٍّ مِّن سَبِيلٍ,"(He whom Allah sendeth astray) from His religion, (for him there is no protecting friend after Him) for him there is none to guard him after Allah.

وَلَئِن سَأَلْتَهُمْ مَّنْ خَلَقَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضَ لَيَقُولُنَّ خَلَقَهُنَّ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْعَلِيمُ,"(And if thou (Muhammad) ask them) i.e. the disbelievers of Mecca: (Who created the heavens and the earth, they) i.e. the disbelievers of Mecca (will surely answer: The Mighty) in His dominion and sovereignty, (the Knower) of His providence and created beings (created them);"
ٱلَّذِي جَعَلَ لَكُمُ ٱلأَرْضَ مَهْداً وَجَعَلَ لَكُمْ فِيهَا سُبُلاً لَّعَلَّكُمْ تَهْتَدُونَ,"Allah says: yes, He created them Him (Who made the earth a resting place for you, and placed roads for you therein, that haply ye may find your way) by means of the roads;"
وَٱلَّذِي نَزَّلَ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مَآءً بِقَدَرٍ فَأَنشَرْنَا بِهِ بَلْدَةً مَّيْتاً كَذَلِكَ تُخْرَجُونَ,"(And who sendeth down water) rain (from the sky in (due) measure) according to the knowledge of the storer, (and We revive a dead land therewith) and We revive through it a barren land that had hitherto no vegetation. (Even so will ye be brought forth) Even so you will be revived and brought forth from the graves as We revive the barren land and bring forth from it vegetation;"
وَٱلَّذِي خَلَقَ ٱلأَزْوَاجَ كُلَّهَا وَجَعَلَ لَكُمْ مِّنَ ٱلْفُلْكِ وَٱلأَنْعَامِ مَا تَرْكَبُونَ,"(He Who created all the pairs) all the different kinds of created beings, (and appointed for you) and created for you (ships and cattle whereupon ye ride."
لِتَسْتَوُواْ عَلَىٰ ظُهُورِهِ ثُمَّ تَذْكُرُواْ نِعْمَةَ رَبِّكُمْ إِذَا ٱسْتَوَيْتُمْ عَلَيْهِ وَتَقُولُواْ سُبْحَانَ ٱلَّذِي سَخَّرَ لَنَا هَـٰذَا وَمَا كُنَّا لَهُ مُقْرِنِينَ,"That ye may mount upon their backs) i.e. the backs of camels, (and may remember your Lord's favour) for making them subdued for you (when ye mount thereon, and may say: Glorified be He Who hath subdued these) camels (unto us, and we were not capable (of subduing them)) and we were not capable of owning them or making them subdued;"
وَإِنَّآ إِلَىٰ رَبِّنَا لَمُنقَلِبُونَ,(And lo! unto our Lord we are returning) after we die.
وَجَعَلُواْ لَهُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ جُزْءًا إِنَّ ٱلإنسَانَ لَكَفُورٌ مُّبِينٌ,"(And they allot to Him) they ascribe to Him (a portion of His bondmen) i.e. the angels! They claimed, i.e. Banu Malih, that the angels were Allah's daughters. (Lo! Man) i.e. the Banu Malih (is verily a mere ingrate) a disbeliever in Allah whose disbelief is quite apparent."
أَمِ ٱتَّخَذَ مِمَّا يَخْلُقُ بَنَاتٍ وَأَصْفَاكُم بِٱلْبَنِينَ,"(Or chooseth He daughters of all that He hath created) i.e. of the angels, (and honours) and choose (He you) i.e. the Banu Malih (with sons?"
وَإِذَا بُشِّرَ أَحَدُهُم بِمَا ضَرَبَ لِلرَّحْمَـٰنِ مَثَلاً ظَلَّ وَجْهُهُ مُسْوَدّاً وَهُوَ كَظِيمٌ,"And if one of them) one of the Banu Malih (hath tidings of that which he likeneth) of that which he ascribes (to the Beneficent One) i.e. daughters, (his countenance becometh black) of grief (and he is full of inward rage) would you then, O Banu Malih, like for Allah that which you do not like for yourselves?"
أَوَمَن يُنَشَّأُ فِي ٱلْحِلْيَةِ وَهُوَ فِي ٱلْخِصَامِ غَيْرُ مُبِينٍ,"((Liken they then to Allah) that which is bred up in outward show) in ornaments of gold and silver, (and in dispute) in speech (cannot make itself plain) whose argument is not strong, i.e. women, how could they be the daughters of Allah?"
وَجَعَلُواْ ٱلْمَلاَئِكَةَ ٱلَّذِينَ هُمْ عِبَادُ ٱلرَّحْمَـٰنِ إِنَاثاً أَشَهِدُواْ خَلْقَهُمْ سَتُكْتَبُ شَهَادَتُهُمْ وَيُسْأَلُونَ,"(And they make the angels, who are the slaves of the Beneficent, females) the daughters of Allah. (Did they witness their creation) when they were created for them to know that they are females? They said: “no, O Muhammad, we did not witness their creation but we heard our fathers saying so”. Allah will say: “O Muhammad!” (Their testimony will be recorded) that they lie against Allah when they claim that the angels are Allah's daughters (and they will be questioned) about this claim on the Day of Judgement. In other words, when they claimed that the angels are Allah's daughters, they were asked: “did you witness their creation?” They said: “No!” “How did you then come to the conclusion that the angels are females and Allah's daughters?” They said: “We heard this from our fathers”. Allah said that their claim about the angels will be recorded and they will be questioned about it on the Day of Judgement."
وَقَالُواْ لَوْ شَآءَ ٱلرَّحْمَـٰنُ مَا عَبَدْنَاهُمْ مَّا لَهُم بِذَلِكَ مِنْ عِلْمٍ إِنْ هُمْ إِلاَّ يَخْرُصُونَ,"(And they) i.e. the Banu Malih (say: If the Beneficent One had (so) willed) if the Beneficent one had repelled and warned us, (we should not have worshipped them) they said this out of mockery, “but He commanded us to worship them and never warned us against such a worship”. (They have no knowledge whatsoever of that) they have no proof or warrant for what they say. (They do but guess) they do but lie against Allah because they were forbidden from worshipping them."
أَمْ آتَيْنَاهُمْ كِتَاباً مِّن قَبْلِهِ فَهُم بِهِ مُسْتَمْسِكُونَ,(Or have We given them any Scripture before) this Qur'an (so that they are holding fast thereto) so that they take such a belief from this Scripture?
بَلْ قَالُوۤاْ إِنَّا وَجَدْنَآ ءَابَآءَنَا عَلَىٰ أُمَّةٍ وَإِنَّا عَلَىٰ ءَاثَارِهِم مُّهْتَدُونَ,"They said: “We do not have, O Muhammad, any other Scripture; but we found our fathers on this belief”. Allah said: (Nay, for they say only: Lo! we found our fathers following a religion, and we are guided by their footprints) and we are following their religion and actions."
وَكَذَلِكَ مَآ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ فِي قَرْيَةٍ مِّن نَّذِيرٍ إِلاَّ قَالَ مُتْرَفُوهَآ إِنَّا وَجَدْنَآ ءَابَآءَنَا عَلَىٰ أُمَّةٍ وَإِنَّا عَلَىٰ ءَاثَارِهِم مُّقْتَدُونَ,"(And even so) just as your own folk said (We sent not a warner) a warning prophet (before thee (Muhammad) into any township) to the inhabitants of any township (but its luxurious ones) the tyrants among them (said: Lo! We found our fathers following a religion) following this religion, (and we are following their footprints) and we are emulating their religion and actions."
قَٰلَ أَوَلَوْ جِئْتُكُمْ بِأَهْدَىٰ مِمَّا وَجَدتُّمْ عَلَيْهِ آبَآءَكُمْ قَالُوۤاْ إِنَّا بِمَآ أُرْسِلْتُمْ بِهِ كَافِرُونَ,"(Say) to them, O Muhammad: (What! Even though I bring you better guidance) a truer religion (than that ye found your fathers following) would you not accept it? (They answered: Lo! in what ye bring) of Scripture (we are disbelievers) we are deniers."
فَٱنتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَٱنظُرْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَاقِبَةُ ٱلْمُكَذِّبِينَ,(So We requited them) by sending punishment upon them when they denied the messengers and Scriptures. (Then see the nature of the consequence for the rejecters) then see the ultimate end of the deniers of Scriptures and messengers!
وَإِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ لأَبِيهِ وَقَوْمِهِ إِنَّنِي بَرَآءٌ مِّمَّا تَعْبُدُونَ,(And when Abraham said unto his father) Azar (and his folk) when He was sent to them: (Lo! I am innocent of what ye worship

وَجَعَلَهَا كَلِمَةً بَاقِيَةً فِي عَقِبِهِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ,"(And he made It) i.e. “there is no deity except Allah” (a word enduring) firm (among his seed) the offspring of Abraham, (that haply they might return) that his folk may return from their disbelief to the belief in Allah's divine Oneness."
بَلْ مَتَّعْتُ هَـٰؤُلاَءِ وَآبَآءَهُمْ حَتَّىٰ جَآءَهُمُ ٱلْحَقُّ وَرَسُولٌ مُّبِينٌ,"(Nay, but I let these) the people of Mecca (and their fathers) before them (enjoy life (only) till there should come unto them the Truth) the Scripture (and a messenger making plain) who explains the Truth to these people in a language they understand."
وَلَمَّا جَآءَهُمُ ٱلْحَقُّ قَالُواْ هَـٰذَا سِحْرٌ وَإِنَّا بِهِ كَافِرُونَ,"(And now that the Truth) the Scripture and Messenger (hath come unto them they say: This) i.e. this Scripture (is mere magic) is a mere lie, (and lo! we are disbelievers therein) in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an."
وَقَالُواْ لَوْلاَ نُزِّلَ هَـٰذَا ٱلْقُرْآنُ عَلَىٰ رَجُلٍ مِّنَ ٱلْقَرْيَتَيْنِ عَظِيمٍ,(And they) i.e. the people of Mecca: al-Walid and his host (say: If only this Qur'an had been revealed to some great man of the two towns) i.e. to al-Walid Ibn al-Mughirah and Abu Mas'ud al-Thaqafi from Mecca and Ta'if respectively?
أَهُمْ يَقْسِمُونَ رَحْمَتَ رَبِّكَ نَحْنُ قَسَمْنَا بَيْنَهُمْ مَّعِيشَتَهُمْ فِي ٱلْحَيَاةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَرَفَعْنَا بَعْضَهُمْ فَوْقَ بَعْضٍ دَرَجَاتٍ لِّيَتَّخِذَ بَعْضُهُم بَعْضاً سُخْرِيّاً وَرَحْمَتُ رَبِّكَ خَيْرٌ مِّمَّا يَجْمَعُونَ,"(Is it they who apportion their Lord's mercy) i.e. your Lord's prophethood and Scriptures, such that they give it to whoever they will? (We have apportioned among them their livelihood) their wealth and children (in the life of the world, and raised some of them above others in rank) and We raised the merits of some above others in relation to wealth and offspring (that some of them may take labour from others) that some may use others in the capacity of servants and slaves; (and the mercy of thy Lord) i.e. prophethood and Scripture; and it is also said that this means: Paradise for the believers (is better than (the wealth) that they amass) is better than what the disbelievers amass of wealth and adornment in the life of the world."
وَلَوْلاَ أَن يَكُونَ ٱلنَّاسُ أُمَّةً وَاحِدَةً لَّجَعَلْنَا لِمَن يَكْفُرُ بِٱلرَّحْمَـٰنِ لِبُيُوتِهِمْ سُقُفاً مِّن فِضَّةٍ وَمَعَارِجَ عَلَيْهَا يَظْهَرُونَ,"(And were it not that mankind would have become one community) i.e. follow one religion, the religion of disbelief, (We might well have appointed, for those who disbelieve in the Beneficent, roofs) the roofs of their houses (of silver for their houses and stairs (of silver) whereby to mount) whereby to climb,"
وَلِبُيُوتِهِمْ أَبْوَاباً وَسُرُراً عَلَيْهَا يَتَّكِئُونَ,"(And for their houses doors (of silver) and couches of silver whereon to recline) to sleep,"
وَزُخْرُفاً وَإِن كُلُّ ذَلِكَ لَمَّا مَتَاعُ ٱلْحَيَاةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَٱلآخِرَةُ عِندَ رَبِّكَ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ,"(And ornaments of gold) and all the gold and silver utensils of their houses. (Yet all that would have been but a provision of the life of the world) yet all that would be but the stuff of the life of the world. (And the Hereafter) i.e. Paradise (with your Lord would have been for those who keep from evil) for those who ward off disbelief, idolatry and indecencies; this is much better than the stuff of the life of the world."
وَمَن يَعْشُ عَن ذِكْرِ ٱلرَّحْمَـٰنِ نُقَيِّضْ لَهُ شَيْطَاناً فَهُوَ لَهُ قَرِينٌ,"(And he whose sight is dim to the remembrance of the Beneficent) and he who is blind to the declaration of the divine Oneness and Scripture of the Beneficent, (We assign unto him a devil who becometh his comrade) in the life of the world and in the Fire;"

حَتَّىٰ إِذَا جَآءَنَا قَالَ يٰلَيْتَ بَيْنِي وَبَيْنَكَ بُعْدَ ٱلْمَشْرِقَيْنِ فَبِئْسَ ٱلْقَرِينُ,"(Till, when he) i.e. the son of Adam along with his comrade the devil, tied to one chain (cometh unto Us, he saith) unto his devil comrade: (Ah, would that between me and thee there were the distance of the two horizons, an evil comrade) and friend!"
وَلَن يَنفَعَكُمُ ٱلْيَوْمَ إِذ ظَّلَمْتُمْ أَنَّكُمْ فِي ٱلْعَذَابِ مُشْتَرِكُونَ,"(And it profiteth you not) Allah says: it profits you not (this day) such talk, (because ye did wrong) because you disbelieved in the life of the world, (that ye will be sharers in the doom) the devils and the children of Adam."
أَفَأَنتَ تُسْمِعُ ٱلصُّمَّ أَوْ تَهْدِي ٱلْعُمْيَ وَمَن كَانَ فِي ضَلاَلٍ مُّبِينٍ,"(Canst thou) O Muhammad (make the deaf to hear) make the one who pretends to be deaf hear the Truth and guidance, (or canst thou guide the blind) or guide the disbeliever to see the Truth and guidance (or him who is in error manifest) whom you cannot guide to the guidance?"
فَإِمَّا نَذْهَبَنَّ بِكَ فَإِنَّا مِنْهُم مُّنتَقِمُونَ,"(And if We take thee away) if We make you die, (We surely shall take vengeance on them) by punishing them,"

فَٱسْتَمْسِكْ بِٱلَّذِيۤ أُوحِيَ إِلَيْكَ إِنَّكَ عَلَىٰ صِرَاطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ,(So hold thou fast to) act upon (that which is inspired in you) i.e. the Qur'an. (Lo! thou) O Muhammad (art on a right path) are on an established religion with which Allah is pleased.
وَإِنَّهُ لَذِكْرٌ لَّكَ وَلِقَوْمِكَ وَسَوْفَ تُسْأَلُونَ,(And lo!) i.e. the Qur'an (is in truth a Reminder for thee) an honour for you (and for thy folk) the Quraysh because it is revealed in their own language; (and ye will be questioned) about the gratitude which is owed to such an honour.
وَسْئَلْ مَنْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رُّسُلِنَآ أَجَعَلْنَا مِن دُونِ ٱلرَّحْمَـٰنِ آلِهَةً يُعْبَدُونَ,"(And ask those of Our messengers) such as Jesus, Moses and Abraham; this was on the night when he was taken up to heaven and he led in prayer 70 prophets, among whom were Abraham, Moses and Jesus. Allah commanded His Prophet, saying: ask them (whom We sent before thee) O Muhammad: (Did We ever appoint gods to be worshipped beside the Beneficent) did We command that any other deity beside the Beneficent be worshipped? It is also said that this means: ask those unto whom We sent the messengers before you, i.e. the people of Book, did We appoint any other deities beside the Beneficent to be worshipped? And it is also said that this means: ask them, did the messengers bring anything other than the profession of Allah's divine Oneness; the Prophet did not have to ask because he was certain that Allah did not appoint any other deities to be worshipped beside Him."
وَلَقَدْ أَرْسَلْنَا مُوسَىٰ بِآيَـٰتِنَآ إِلَىٰ فِرْعَوْنَ وَمَلإِيْهِ فَقَالَ إِنِّي رَسُولُ رَبِّ ٱلْعَـٰلَمِينَ,"(And verily We sent Moses with Our revelations) the hand and the staff (unto Pharaoh and his chiefs) and his folk the Copts, (and he said: I am a messenger of the Lord of the Worlds) to you."
فَلَمَّا جَآءَهُم بِآيَاتِنَآ إِذَا هُم مِّنْهَا يَضْحَكُونَ,"(But when he) Moses (brought them Our tokens) the hand and the staff, (behold! they laughed at them) they were first amazed but then mocked these signs, refusing thus to believe in them."
وَمَا نُرِيِهِم مِّنْ آيَةٍ إِلاَّ هِيَ أَكْبَرُ مِنْ أُخْتِهَا وَأَخَذْنَاهُم بِٱلْعَذَابِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ,"(And every token) sign (that We showed them was greater than its sister (token)) that We sent before it, even so they refused to believe, (and we grasped them with the torment) with the flood, locusts, lice, frogs, blood, shortage of foodstuffs and years of drought, (that haply they might turn again) that haply they might desist from their disbelief."
وَقَالُواْ يَٰأَيُّهَ ٱلسَّاحِرُ ٱدْعُ لَنَا رَبَّكَ بِمَا عَهِدَ عِندَكَ إِنَّنَا لَمُهْتَدُونَ,"(And they said: O wizard) O knowledgeable wizard, as a form of respect, because magicians were venerated amongst them; (Entreat thy Lord for us by the pact that He hath made with thee) ask your Lord by the pact Allah made with you-the pact was that if they believed He will remove His punishment from them-this is why they asked him by the pact that Allah had made. (Lo! we verily will walk aright) we will believe in you and in that which you brought."
فَلَمَّا كَشَفْنَا عَنْهُمُ ٱلْعَذَابَ إِذَا هُمْ يَنكُثُونَ,"(But when We eased them of the torment) when We removed the torment from them, (behold! they broke their word) they broke their undertaking and refused to believe."
وَنَادَىٰ فِرْعَوْنُ فِي قَوْمِهِ قَالَ يٰقَوْمِ أَلَيْسَ لِي مُلْكُ مِصْرَ وَهَـٰذِهِ ٱلأَنْهَارُ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِيۤ أَفَلاَ تُبْصِرُونَ,"(And Pharaoh caused a proclamation to be made among his people) Pharaoh delivered a sermon to his people, the Copts, (saying: O my people! Is not mine the sovereignty of Egypt) which is 40 square parasangs (and these rivers flowing under me) around me; it is also said what he meant here is: and these horses run around me? (Can ye not then discern?"
أَمْ أَنَآ خَيْرٌ مِّنْ هَـٰذَا ٱلَّذِي هُوَ مَهِينٌ وَلاَ يَكَادُ يُبِينُ,"I am surely better than this fellow, who is despicable) physically weak, (and can hardly make (his meaning) plain) his argument plain!"
فَلَوْلاَ أُلْقِيَ عَلَيْهِ أَسْوِرَةٌ مِّن ذَهَبٍ أَوْ جَآءَ مَعَهُ ٱلْمَلاَئِكَةُ مُقْتَرِنِينَ,"(Why, then, have armlets of gold not been set upon him) as you yourselves are wearing, (or angels sent along with him) to help him and affirm the message with which he is sent?"

فَلَمَّآ آسَفُونَا ٱنتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَاهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ,"(So, when they angered Us) when they angered Our Prophet Moses, and tended to anger Us, (We punished them and drowned them every one) in the sea."

For if he is allowed in the Fire with the Christians, we are also allowed therein with our deities. (They raise not the objection) they do not mention Jesus the son of Mary (save for argument) save for wrangling and dispute. (Nay! but they are a contentious folk) they argue in defence of falsehood."
إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ وَجَعَلْنَاهُ مَثَلاً لِّبَنِيۤ إِسْرَائِيلَ,"(He is nothing) i.e. Jesus the son of Mary (but a slave on whom We bestowed favour) by entrusting him with the message and he is nothing like their deities, (and We made him a pattern) a lesson (for the Children of Israel) in that he was born without a father."
وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لَجَعَلْنَا مِنكُمْ مَّلاَئِكَةً فِي ٱلأَرْضِ يَخْلُفُونَ,(And had We willed We could have set among you) in your own places; and it is said this means: had We willed We would have created instead of you (angels to be vicegerents in the earth) angels instead of you; it is also said this means: angels to walk in the earth instead of you.
وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ فَلاَ تَمْتَرُنَّ بِهَا وَٱتَّبِعُونِ هَـٰذَا صِرَاطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ,"(And lo! Verily) in the coming of Jesus the son of Mary (there is knowledge of the Hour) there is an indication of the coming of the Hour; it is also said that this means: his coming is a sign of the advent of the Hour. (So doubt ye not concerning it) so have no doubt in the coming of the Hour, (but follow Me) by professing Allah's divine Oneness. (This) profession of divine Oneness (is the right path) an established religion with which Allah is pleased: i.e. the religion of Islam."
وَلاَ يَصُدَّنَّكُمُ ٱلشَّيْطَانُ إِنَّهُ لَكُمْ عَدُوٌّ مُّبِينٌ,(And let not Satan turn you aside) let not Satan turn you away from the religion of Islam or from belief in the coming of the Hour. (Lo! he is an open enemy for you) whose enmity is quite manifest.

This forgiveness relates to the period before the migration to Medina. They were later commanded to fight the disbelievers."

(And they differed not) regarding Muhammad (pbuh) the Qur'an and Islam (until after the knowledge came unto them) until the explanation in their own Scripture came to them, (through rivalry among themselves) because of resentful envy they refused to believe in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an. (Lo! thy Lord) O Muhammad (will judge between them) between the Jews, Christians and believers (on the Day of Resurrection concerning that wherein) in matter of religion (they used to differ) in the life of the world."

And so Allah said: or do they (suppose that We shall make them) that We shall make the disbelievers in terms of reward in the Hereafter (as those who believe) 'Ali and his two fellow believers (and do good works) and do acts of obedience privately between themselves and their Lord, (the same life and death?) the life of the believer in his state of faith and his death in a state of faith cannot be the same as the life of the disbeliever who lives and dies in transgression and disbelief while Allah is angry with him. (Bad is their judgement) evil is that which they judge for themselves!"

(Then who will lead him) who will guide him to the religion of Allah (after Allah) has sent him astray? (Will ye not then heed) by means of the Qur'an and understand that Allah is one, without partners?"

So the Prophet (pbuh) said: “I do not know what will be done with me or with you; nor whether we should migrate from Mecca or not”. (I do but follow) act upon (that which is inspired in me) that which I am commanded in the Qur'an, (and I am but a plain warner) a warning messenger who addresses you in a language that you understand."

Lo! Allah, guides not) to his religion (wrong-doing folk) a folk that does not deserve it."
وَقَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لِلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ لَوْ كَانَ خَيْراً مَّا سَبَقُونَآ إِلَيْهِ وَإِذْ لَمْ يَهْتَدُواْ بِهِ فَسَيَقُولُونَ هَـٰذَآ إِفْكٌ قَدِيمٌ,"(And those who disbelieve) Asad, Ghatafan and Hanzalah (say of those who believe) Juhaynah, Muzaynah and Aslam: (If it had been (any) good) if what Muhammad (pbuh) says had any good or truth in it, (they would not have been before us in attaining it) Juhaynah, Muzaynah and Aslam would not have been first to accept it. (And since they will not be guided by it) and since Asad and Ghatafan do not believe in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an, (they say: This is an ancient lie) this Qur'an is an ancient lie;"
وَمِن قَبْلِهِ كِتَابُ مُوسَىٰ إِمَاماً وَرَحْمَةً وَهَـٰذَا كِتَابٌ مُّصَدِّقٌ لِّسَاناً عَرَبِيّاً لِّيُنذِرَ ٱلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ وَبُشْرَىٰ لِلْمُحْسِنِينَ,"(When before it) before the Qur'an (there was the Scripture of Moses) the Torah, (an example) to be emulated (and a mercy) shielding from chastisement for those who believe in it. But they did not believe in it nor took it as an example to be emulated; (and this) Qur'an (is a confirming Scripture) it confirms the Torah in the call to belief in Allah's divine Oneness and in the attributes and description of the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) (in the Arabic language) in the Arabic usage, (that it may warn those who do wrong) the idolaters (and bring good tidings for the righteous) bring the good tidings of Paradise for the believers."
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ قَالُواْ رَبُّنَا ٱللَّهُ ثُمَّ ٱسْتَقَامُواْ فَلاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلاَ هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ,"(Lo! those who say: our Lord is Allah) those who declare Allah's divine Oneness, (and thereafter walk aright) and thereafter hold fast to performing the obligations of Allah and to avoiding transgressing against Him and, further, do not play about in matters of religion, (there shall no fear come upon them) in relation to future torment (neither shall they grieve) for what they have left behind; it is also said that this means: there shall be no fear upon them when the people of the Fire are in fear, and they shall not grieve when others do."
أُوْلَـٰئِكَ أَصْحَابُ ٱلْجَنَّةِ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا جَزَآءً بِمَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ,"(Such are rightful owners of the Garden, immortal thereafter) they will dwell therein forever, never to die nor leave it (as a reward for what they used to do) and say in the life of the world."

(His mother beareth him) in her womb (with reluctance) with hardship, (and bringeth him forth with reluctance) and delivers him in hardship, (and the bearing of him) in the womb of his mother (and the weaning of him is thirty months, till, when he attaineth full strength) between the age of 18 to the age of 30 (and reacheth forty years, he saith) Abu Bakr says: (My Lord! Arouse me) inspire in me (that I may give thanks for the favour) of believing in Your divine Oneness (wherewith Thou hast favoured me and my parents) who by then had both accepted Islam, (and that I may do right) sincere righteous works which are (acceptable unto Thee. And be gracious unto me in the matter of my seed) and honour my offspring with repentance and Islam, for 'Abd al-Rahman was not a Muslim by then; he became Muslim later. (Lo! I have turned unto Thee repentant, and lo! I am of those who surrender (unto Thee)) following their religion."

(Do ye threaten me that I shall be brought forth (again)) from the grave for the resurrection (when generations before me have passed away) and I have not seen them resurrected? He was referring to two of his forefathers who died during the pagan era: Jad'an and 'Uthman the sons of 'Amr. (And they twain) his parents (cry unto Allah for help (and say): Woe unto thee) may Allah straiten your livelihood! (Believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an! (Lo! the promise of Allah) about the resurrection (is true) will happen after death. (But he saith) 'Abd al-Rahman says: (This) which Muhammad (s)ays (is naught save fables of the men of old) nothing but the lies of the men of old:

(Lo! they are the losers) and they will not be resurrected in the life of the world until the Day of Judgement. 'Abd al-Rahman later accepted Islam and became a good Muslim."

(Now this day ye are rewarded with the) severe (doom of ignominy because ye were disdainful) because you were too proud to accept faith (in the land without a right and because ye used to transgress) and because you used to disbelieve and transgress on the earth in the life of the world."

(Lo! I fear for you) I know that (the doom of a tremendous Day) a severe torment will befall you if you reject faith."

He riddeth them of their ill deeds) i.e. their sins by means of jihad (and improveth their state) and improves their condition, intention and works in the life of he world; and it is said: He makes their matter manifest in Islam."

(Thus Allah coineth) thus Allah present (their similitudes) the similitudes of those who came before them: how Allah had destroyed them when they denied the messengers (for mankind) for the community of Muhammad (pbuh)."

(That (is the ordinance)) to punish whoever disbelieves in Allah. (And if Allah willed He could have punished them (without you)) if Allah willed He could have punished the disbelievers of Mecca through the angels; it is also said that this means: if Allah willed He could have punished the disbelievers of Mecca without you having to fight them, (but (thus it is ordained) that He may try some of you by means of others) but it is thus that He may test the believers with the disbelievers and the relative with his relative. (And those who are slain in the way of Allah) and those who are killed in obedience of Allah on the Day of Badr, referring here to the prophetic Companions, (He rendereth not their actions vain) Allah will not thwart their good deeds which were performed during jihad."

(Then, when the matter is determined) when the matter is resolved, Islam becomes manifest and the Muslims are numerous, (if they) i.e. the hypocrites (are loyal to Allah) through their faith and jihad (it will be well for them) it will be better for them than transgression."

They did this while completely ignoring the Prophet who was on the pulpit delivering his sermon. And then, in mockery, asked 'Abdullah Ibn Mas'ud about what the Prophet (pbuh) said in his sermon."

By Allah, we are just like them, so what do we get?” Allah said: (And may punish the hypocritical men and the hypocritical women, and the idolatrous men and the idolatrous women, who think an evil thought concerning Allah) that He will not help His Messenger against the hypocrites. (For them is the evil turn of fortune) and an evil consequence, (and Allah is wroth against them and hath cursed them) He banished them from all good, (and hath made ready for them) in the Hereafter (hell, a hapless journey's end) what an evil destination they will head for in the Hereafter."
وَلِلَّهِ جُنُودُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ عَزِيزاً حَكِيماً,"(Allah's are the hosts of the heavens) the angels (and the earth) the believers; He gives help to whomever He will, (and Allah is ever Mighty) in retribution against the disbelievers and hypocrites, (Wise) in bestowing honour on true believers because of their faith; and it is also said that this means: Allah is ever Mighty in His dominion and sovereignty, Wise in His command, decree and help of His Prophet against his enemies."
إِنَّآ أَرْسَلْنَٰكَ شَٰهِداً وَمُبَشِّراً وَنَذِيراً,"(Lo! We have sent thee) O Muhammad (as a witness) over your community that you had delivered the message to them (and a bearer of good tidings) the Garden for the believers (and a warner) to the disbelievers from the Fire,"
لِّتُؤْمِنُواْ بِٱللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ وَتُعَزِّرُوهُ وَتُوَقِّرُوهُ وَتُسَبِّحُوهُ بُكْرَةً وَأَصِيلاً,"(That ye (mankind) may believe in Allah and His messenger) Muhammad (pbuh) (and may honour Him) defend him with the sword against his enemies, (and may revere Him, and may glorify Him) and pray to Allah (at early dawn and at the close of day) in the morning and evening."
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يُبَايِعُونَكَ إِنَّمَا يُبَايِعُونَ ٱللَّهَ يَدُ ٱللَّهِ فَوْقَ أَيْدِيهِمْ فَمَن نَّكَثَ فَإِنَّمَا يَنكُثُ عَلَىٰ نَفْسِهِ وَمَنْ أَوْفَىٰ بِمَا عَاهَدَ عَلَيْهُ ٱللَّهَ فَسَيُؤْتِيهِ أَجْراً عَظِيماً,"Then He mentioned the pact of Ridwan at al-Hudaybiyyah which took place under a tree, the Samurah tree; those present at this pact were about 1500 people, and swore allegiance to the Prophet of Allah which, among others, entailed giving counsel, help and not running away [in war]. Allah said: (Lo! those who swear allegiance unto thee (Muhammad)) on the Day of al-Hudaybiyyah, (swear allegiance only unto Allah) it is as if they swear allegiance to Allah. (The Hand of Allah) in terms of reward and help (is above their hands) in relation to truthfulness, fulfilment and completion. (So whosoever breaketh his oath, breaketh it only to his soul's hurt) the punishment of this breaking is against his soul; (while whosoever keepeth his covenant with Allah) and remain truthful and loyal, (on him will He bestow immense reward) on him Allah bestows abundant reward in Paradise. None of those who swore allegiance broke his oath, because they were all sincere and died honouring the allegiance of Ridwan. That is to say to the exception of one man named Jadd Ibn Qays, a hypocrite, who hid on that day behind his camel and did not join in when the swearing of allegiance took place. Allah made him die in his state of hypocrisy."

(They speak with their tongues) they ask with their tongue-i.e. forgiveness-(that which is not in their hearts) without really feeling the need for it, whether you ask forgiveness for them or not. (Say) to them, O Muhammad: (Who can avail you aught against Allah) who can do anything about Allah's torment, (if he intend you hurt) killing and defeat (or intend you profit) victory, booty and well-being? (Nay, but Allah is ever Aware of what ye do) Allah is aware of your failure to join the conquest of al-Hudaybiyyah."
بَلْ ظَنَنْتُمْ أَن لَّن يَنقَلِبَ ٱلرَّسُولُ وَٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ إِلَىٰ أَهْلِيهِمْ أَبَداً وَزُيِّنَ ذَلِكَ فِي قُلُوبِكُمْ وَظَنَنتُمْ ظَنَّ ٱلسَّوْءِ وَكُنتُمْ قَوْماً بُوراً,"(Nay, but ye deemed) O hypocrites (that the messenger and the believers would never return to their own folk) from al-Hudaybiyyah to Medina, (and that was made fair-seeming in your hearts) and you were so convinced of this that you stayed behind, (and ye did think an evil thought) and you thought that Allah will not help His Prophet, (and ye were worthless folk) and you were ruined folk, with unsound and hardened hearts."
وَمَن لَّمْ يُؤْمِن بِٱللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ فَإِنَّآ أَعْتَدْنَا لِلْكَافِرِينَ سَعِيراً,(And as for him who believeth not in Allah and His messenger) as for him who is not true in his faith in Allah and His Messenger. (Lo! We have prepared a flame for disbelievers) for disbelievers who disbelieve openly or secretly.

(He forgiveth whom He will) of the believers for committing enormities, out of favour, (and punisheth whom He will) for committing minor sins, in justice; it is also said that this means: He honours whom He will with faith and repentance such that He forgives him and makes die whom He will in a state of disbelief and hypocrisy and then punishes him for it; and it is also said that this means: He forgives whoever deserves to be forgiven and punishes whoever deserves to be punished. (And Allah is ever Forgiving) He always forgives whoever repents of enormous and minor sins, (Merciful) towards whoever dies repentant."

(They fain would change the verdict of Allah) when he said to His Prophet not to let them accompany him to any other conquest after failing to join the conquest of al-Hudaybiyyah. (Say) to Banu 'Amir, Dayl, Aslam, Ashja', and a group from Muzaynah and Juhaynah: (Ye shall not go with us) to Khaybar except as volunteers but you will not have a share of the booty. (Thus) just as we told you (hath Allah said beforehand) in surah Repentance (say unto them: Ye shall never more go out with me nor fight with me against a foe…). Upon hearing this, the hypocrites said to the believers: Allah has not commanded you this, it is rather because you are resentfully envious of us for sharing the booty with you. So Allah said: (Then they will say: Ye are envious of us) regarding the booty. (Nay, but they understand not) the command of Allah, (save a little) neither much nor a little."

Allah has threatened to punish whoever stays behind and does not take part in fighting with a painful doom. How can we go out in military expedition when we are physically unable to do so?” And so Allah said: (There is no blame for the blind) if he does not go out in military conquests, (nor is there blame for the lame) if he does not go out in military conquests, (nor is there blame for the sick (that they go not forth to war). And whoso obeyeth Allah and His messenger) openly and privately and answers him by going out to fight the enemy, (He will make him enter Gardens beneath which) beneath whose houses, rooms and trees (rivers) of wine, water, honey, and milk (flow; and whoso turneth back) from the obedience of Allah and His Messenger and refuses to comply, (him will He punish with a painful doom)."

(And those with him) i.e. Abu Bakr, the first who believed in him and called the disbelievers with him to the religion of Allah (are hard against the disbelievers) this refers to 'Umar Ibn al-Khattab who was tough with the enemies of Allah, strong in the religion of Allah and a defender of Allah's Messenger (and merciful among themselves) and dutiful towards each other; this refers to 'Uthman Ibn 'Affan who was very dutiful and merciful towards the Muslims, and spent much of his money on them. (Thou (O Muhammad) seest them bowing) in prayer (and falling prostrate (in worship)) this refers to 'Ali Ibn Abi Talib who abundantly bowed and prostrated in prayer, (seeking bounty) reward (from Allah and (His) acceptance) acceptance of their Lord through jihad; this refers to Talhah and al-Zubayr who were very hard on, and tough with, the disbelievers. (The mark of them is on their foreheads from) the sign of their staying awake is on their faces from (the traces of prostration) from repeated prostration at night; this refers to Salman al-Farisi, Bilal, Suhayb and their fellow believers. (Such is their likeness) their description (in the Torah and their likeness) and their description in (in the Gospel like as sown corn) this is the Prophet (pbuh) (that) Allah (sendeth forth its shoot) i.e. Abu Bakr, the first to believe in him and the first to face the enemies of Allah (and strengtheneth it) and assists him; this is 'Umar who assisted the Prophet (pbuh) with his sword against the enemies of Allah (and riseth firm) He became strong with the wealth of 'Uthman which he used in jihad in the way of Allah (upon its stalk) and spread his message among Quraysh through 'Ali Ibn Abi Talib, (delighting the sowers) the Prophet (pbuh) was pleased with Talhah and al-Zubayr (that He may enrage the disbelievers with (the sight of) them) by means of Talhah and al-Zubayr. It is also said that from Allah's saying (Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah…) up to here was revealed in praise of those who took part in the swearing of allegiance at Ridwan and the sincere, obedient prophetic Companions in general. (Allah hath promised, unto such of them as believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an (and do good works) and do acts of obedience in private between themselves and their Lord, (forgiveness) of their sins in this world and in the Hereafter (and immense reward) and abundant reward in the Garden'."

Be not forward in the presence of Allah): '(O ye who believe! Be not forward in the presence of Allah) do not start with any word or action until the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) commands or prohibits you first; it is also said that this means: do not start immolating your sacrifices on the day of immolation (and His messenger) until you receive Allah's command and the command of His Messenger; it is also said that this means: do not oppose the Messenger; and it is said this means: do not contravene the Book of Allah or the practice of His Messenger, (and keep your duty to Allah) fear Allah in relation to saying or doing anything without the command of Allah or of His Messenger, and do not oppose the Book of Allah or the practice of His Messenger. (Lo! Allah is Hearer) of what you say, (Knower) of your works. This was revealed about three prophetic Companions who killed two men from Banu Salim when the Muslims had a peace treaty with them, without being commanded to do so by Allah or by His Messenger. Allah, glorified and Exalted is He, forbade them from engaging in any matter without a command from Allah or His Messenger."

This was revealed about Thabit Ibn Qays Ibn Shammas who raised his voice in the presence of the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) upon the visit of the delegation of Banu Tamim. And so Allah forbade him from doing so. Allah said: O you who believe in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an; in reference to Thabit, (Lift not up your voices above the voice of the Prophet) Allah bless him and give him peace, nor insist in talking when the Prophet (pbuh) is talking, (nor shout when speaking to him) nor call him by his first name (as ye shout one to another) as you would do with one another; rather you should reverence and honour him and address him by: “O Prophet of Allah” or “O Messenger of Allah” or “O Abu'l-Qasim”, (lest your works be rendered vain while ye perceive not) lest your good works be nullified for failing to observe propriety and reverence towards the Prophet (pbuh) while not knowing that your works are nullified."

(Theirs will be forgiveness) of their sins in the life of the world (and immense reward) and abundant reward in the Garden."
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يُنَادُونَكَ مِن وَرَآءِ ٱلْحُجُرَاتِ أَكْثَرُهُمْ لاَ يَعْقِلُونَ,"(Lo! those who call thee from behind the private apartment) this was revealed about a folk from Banu 'Anbar, from the Khuza'ah tribe to whom the Prophet (pbuh) sent a military expedition under the leadership of 'Uyaynah Ibn Hisn al-Fazari. When they heard of the advance of this expedition towards them, they fled, leaving behind their wives and children and properties. Their wives and children were taken captive and brought to the Prophet (pbuh). The men who fled went to Medina to ransom their wives and children and entered the city at the time of the siesta. They called: “O Muhammad, come out to see us”, while he was sleeping. Allah censured them for doing so, saying: (Lo! those who call you from behind the private apartment most of them) all of them (have no sense) do not understand Allah's command or divine Oneness nor the reverence due to Allah's Messenger."
وَلَوْ أَنَّهُمْ صَبَرُواْ حَتَّىٰ تَخْرُجَ إِلَيْهِمْ لَكَانَ خَيْراً لَّهُمْ وَٱللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"(And if they) the Banu 'Anbar (had patience till thou camest forth unto them) for the prayer, (it had been better for them) he would have freed all their wives and children; instead he freed half of them and agreed the ransom of the remaining half. (And Allah is Forgiving) He forgives whoever repents of them, (Merciful) in that He did not hasten His punishment on them."
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُوۤاْ إِن جَآءَكُمْ فَاسِقٌ بِنَبَإٍ فَتَبَيَّنُوۤاْ أَن تُصِيبُواْ قَوْمًا بِجَهَالَةٍ فَتُصْبِحُواْ عَلَىٰ مَا فَعَلْتُمْ نَادِمِينَ,"(O ye who believe! If an evil-liver) this was revealed about al-Walid Ibn 'Uqbah Ibn Ma'it who was sent by the Prophet (pbuh) to Banu'l-Mustaliq to collect their alms; instead he came back claiming that they wanted to kill him. The Prophet (pbuh) and his Companions were about to set forth to conquer them but Allah forbade them from doing so, saying: O you who believe in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an if a hypocrite, al-Walid Ibn 'Uqbah, (bring you tidings) brings you news about Banu'l-Mustaliq, (verify it) check whether the news are true or false, (lest ye smite some folk in ignorance and afterward repent of what ye did) regret killing them."
وَٱعْلَمُوۤاْ أَنَّ فِيكُمْ رَسُولَ ٱللَّهِ لَوْ يُطِيعُكُمْ فِي كَثِيرٍ مِّنَ ٱلأَمْرِ لَعَنِتُّمْ وَلَـٰكِنَّ ٱللَّهَ حَبَّبَ إِلَيْكُمُ ٱلإِيمَانَ وَزَيَّنَهُ فِي قُلُوبِكُمْ وَكَرَّهَ إِلَيْكُمُ ٱلْكُفْرَ وَٱلْفُسُوقَ وَٱلْعِصْيَانَ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلرَّاشِدُونَ,"(And know) O believers (that the Messenger of Allah is among you) is with you. (If he were to obey you in much of the government) in much of what you request, (ye would surely be in trouble) you would surly sin; (but Allah hath endeared the faith) the belief in Allah and His Messenger (to you and hath beautified it in your hearts) and made it seem good in your hearts, (and hath made disbelief) denial of Allah and His Messenger (and lewdness) hypocrisy (and rebellion) and all transgressions (hateful unto you. Such) those who have such traits (are they who are rightly guided."
فَضْلاً مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَنِعْمَةً وَٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ حَكِيمٌ,"(It is) a bounty and a grace from Allah) that He honoured the believers; (and Allah is Knower) of honouring the believers, (Wise) in placing in their hearts love of faith and hatred of disbelief, lewdness and rebellion."

(And if one party of them) the party of 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy Ibn Salul (doeth wrong to) persists and transgresses against (the other) the party of 'Abdullah Ibn Rawahah al-Ansari, and refuses to make peace by referring the matter to the Qur'an, (fight ye that which doeth wrong till it return unto the ordinance of Allah) until it accepts to make peace by referring to the ordinances of the Qur'an; (then, if it return) if it accepts to make peace by referring the matter to the Book of Allah, (make peace between them justly, and act equitably) towards both parties. (Lo! Allah loveth the equitable) Allah loves those who judge justly by the Book of Allah, and act upon it."
إِنَّمَا ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ إِخْوَةٌ فَأَصْلِحُواْ بَيْنَ أَخَوَيْكُمْ وَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُرْحَمُونَ,(The believers are naught else than brothers) in religion. (Therefore make peace between your brethren) by means of the Book of Allah (and observe your duty to Allah) and fear Allah regarding that which He commands you regarding making peace (that haply ye may obtain mercy) and not be punished.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ لاَ يَسْخَرْ قَوْمٌ مِّن قَوْمٍ عَسَىٰ أَن يَكُونُواْ خَيْراً مِّنْهُمْ وَلاَ نِسَآءٌ مِّن نِّسَآءٍ عَسَىٰ أَن يَكُنَّ خَيْراً مِّنْهُنَّ وَلاَ تَلْمِزُوۤاْ أَنفُسَكُمْ وَلاَ تَنَابَزُواْ بِٱلأَلْقَابِ بِئْسَ ٱلاسْمُ ٱلْفُسُوقُ بَعْدَ ٱلإَيمَانِ وَمَن لَّمْ يَتُبْ فَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلظَّالِمُونَ,"(O ye who believe! Let not a folk deride a folk) this was revealed about Thabit Ibn Qays Ibn Shammas who mentioned a man of the Helpers with something bad; he mentioned the man's mother about whom he used to taunted in the pre-Islamic period, but Allah forbade him from saying ill things about fellow believers, saying: (O ye who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an; referring here specifically to Thabit! (Let not a folk deride a folk who may be better than they (are)) in the sight of Allah and also better in the share they have with Him, (nor let women (deride) women) this was revealed about two of the wives of the Prophet (pbuh) who derided Umm Salamah, the wife of the Prophet, and Allah forbade them from doing so (who may be better than they are) in the sight of Allah and also better in the share they have with Him; (neither defame one another) do not defame your believing brothers nor backbite against each other, (nor insult one another by nicknames) which were used in the pre-Islamic period. (Bad is the name of lewdness) it is bad to call your brother: “O Jew”, “O Christian”, “O Magian” (after faith) after having accepted faith and turned his back on all that. (And whoso turneth not in repentance) from calling his brothers with such names and nicknames after having accepted faith, (such are evil-doers) such are those who harm themselves with punishment. This was revealed about Abu Burdah Ibn Malik al-Ansari and 'Abdullah Ibn Hadrad al-Aslami who had a dispute and Allah forbade them from doing so."

(Shun much suspicion) this was revealed about two Companions of the Prophet (pbuh) who backbit Salman al-Farisi and also thought ill of Usamah, the Servant of Allah's Messenger (pbuh). They spied on him to see whether Usamah did really have what the Prophet (pbuh) asked him to give to them. Allah therefore forbade them from having a bad opinion about others, as well as from suspicion and spying; and so He said: O you who believe in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an, shun much suspicion about your brother's ins and outs (for lo! some suspicion is a crime) for some ill thoughts and what you hide are sins; this is what the two men thought of Usamah. (And spy not) and do not scrutinise the faults of your brother, nor reveal that which Allah has concealed about him; and this is exactly what the two men did, (neither backbite one another) the two backbit Salman. (Would one of you love to eat the flesh of his dead brother) unlawfully without any necessity? (Ye abhor that (so abhor the other)) you deem eating the flesh of a carrion unlawful unless it is out of necessity, consider backbiting your brother likewise! (And keep your duty (to Allah)) fear Allah regarding backbiting anyone. (Lo! Allah is Relenting) Allah forgives whoever repents of backbiting, (Merciful) towards whoever die repentant."
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّاسُ إِنَّا خَلَقْنَاكُم مِّن ذَكَرٍ وَأُنْثَىٰ وَجَعَلْنَاكُمْ شُعُوباً وَقَبَآئِلَ لِتَعَارَفُوۤاْ إِنَّ أَكْرَمَكُمْ عَندَ ٱللَّهِ أَتْقَاكُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلِيمٌ خَبِيرٌ,"(O mankind!) This was revealed about Thabit Ibn Qays Ibn Shammas who said to a man: “You are the son of so-and-so” in reference to his mother; and it is also said that it was revealed about Bilal the muezzin of the Prophet (pbuh). When Bilal gave the call to prayer in Mecca after its conquest, a group of men from Quraysh, among whom were Sahl Ibn 'Amr, al-Harth Ibn Hisham and Abu Sufyan Ibn Harb, said: “Did Allah and His Messenger not find anyone to call to prayer except this raven”. In response, Allah said: (Lo! We have created you male and female) from Adam and Eve, (and have made you nations and tribes that ye may know one another. Lo! the noblest of you) in the Hereafter, (in the sight of Allah) on the Day of Judgement, (is the best in conduct) in the life of the world; which in this case is Bilal. (Lo! Allah is Knower) of your status and lineage, (Aware) of your works and standing in His sight."

But their presence in Medina caused a rise in the price of foodstuffs and the streets of Medina became full of their impurities. In fact, these people were hypocrites who kept reiterating: “O Messenger of Allah! We are true believers, so do feed us and be generous with us”. When Allah mentioned their claim, the wandering Arabs of Banu Asad said: “We are genuine in our faith in Allah and His Messenger”. But Allah said: (Say) to them, O Muhammad: (Ye believe not) you are not genuine in your faith in Allah and His Messenger, (but rather say “We submit”) we submit so that we may be spared from the sword and captivity, (for the faith hath not yet entered into your hearts) for love and sincerity of faith have not entered your hearts. (Yet, if ye obey Allah and His messenger) inwardly as you obey him outwardly and repent of inward disbelief and hypocrisy, (He will not withhold from you aught of (the reward of) your deeds) He will not diminish the reward of your works. (Lo! Allah is Forgiving) He forgives whoever repent of you, (Merciful) towards whoever dies repentant."

(Such are the sincere) who are true in their faith and striving."

(Say) to them, O Muhammad: (Deem not your Surrender a favour unto me; nay, but Allah doth confer a favour on you, inasmuch as He hath led you) that He has called you (to the Faith) to accept the Faith, (if ye are earnest) in your claim that you are true believers; but you are not."

Allah knoweth the Unseen of the heavens and the earth) He knows the future events that will take place in the heavens and the earth. (And Allah is Seer of what ye do) O hypocrites, in your state of hypocrisy and He also knows your punishment if you do not repent'."
قۤ وَٱلْقُرْآنِ ٱلْمَجِيدِ,"And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said in the interpretation of Allah's saying (Qaf.): '(Qaf.) He says: it is an azure mountain overlooking this world, and the colour of the sky takes from it; Allah swore by it, (By the glorious Qur'an) and He swore by the glorious, noble Qur'an,"
بَلْ عَجِبُوۤاْ أَن جَآءَهُمْ مُّنذِرٌ مِّنْهُمْ فَقَالَ ٱلْكَافِرُونَ هَـٰذَا شَيْءٌ عَجِيبٌ,"(Nay, but they marvel) i.e. the Quraysh; and it is because they marvelled that Allah made this oath: they marvelled when they were told they will be resurrected after death; He said: in fact the Quraysh, among whom Ubayy and Umayyah the sons of Khalaf, Munbih and Nabih the son of Hajjaj, marvelled (that a warner) a warning messenger (of their own) from their own lineage (hath come unto them; and the disbelievers) the disbelievers of Mecca: Ubayy, Umayyah, Munbih and Nabih (say: This) which Muhammad (pbuh) says, i.e. that they will be resurrected after death, (is a strange thing) for he says:"
أَءِذَا مِتْنَا وَكُنَّا تُرَاباً ذَلِكَ رَجْعٌ بَعِيدٌ,(When we are dead and have become dust (shall we be brought back again)? That) which Muhammad claims (would be a far return!) will never happen; thus denying resurrection after death.
قَدْ عَلِمْنَا مَا تَنقُصُ ٱلأَرْضُ مِنْهُمْ وَعِندَنَا كِتَابٌ حَفِيظٌ,"Allah, Exalted is He, said: (We know that which the earth taketh of them) We know that which the earth devours of their flesh after they die and that which it leaves, (and with Us is a recording Book) and with Us is a Book preserved from Satan. This is the Guarded Tablet wherein is recorded their death, stay in the grave and resurrection on the Day of Judgement."

أَفَلَمْ يَنظُرُوۤاْ إِلَى ٱلسَّمَآءِ فَوْقَهُمْ كَيْفَ بَنَيْنَاهَا وَزَيَّنَّاهَا وَمَا لَهَا مِن فُرُوجٍ,"(Have they) i.e. the disbelievers of Mecca (not then observed the sky above them) above their heads, (how We have constructed it) without pillars (and beautified it) and beautified it with stars, (and how there are no rifts therein) and how there are no rifts, cracks or defects therein?"

I did not cause him to rebel) “I did not hasten to record his evil deeds nor did I record that which he has never said or done”; this will be said when the disbeliever will claim that the angel hastened to write his evil deeds and recorded that which he never said or did. it is also said that his comrade is his devil who will plead with Allah that he did not cause him to rebel or err (but be was (himself) far gone in error) far from the Truth and guidance.
قَالَ لاَ تَخْتَصِمُواْ لَدَيَّ وَقَدْ قَدَّمْتُ إِلَيْكُم بِٱلْوَعِيدِ,"(He saith) Allah says to them: (Contend not in My presence, when I had already proffered unto you the warning) I have informed you in the Scripture with which the Messenger was sent about this Day."
مَا يُبَدَّلُ ٱلْقَوْلُ لَدَيَّ وَمَآ أَنَاْ بِظَلاَّمٍ لِّلْعَبِيدِ,"(The sentence that cometh from Me cannot be changed) My words cannot be changed through lying; and it is also said that this means: My decree concerning My salves will not be changed this Day; and it is also said that this means: words cannot be twisted in My presence, (and I am in nowise a tyrant unto the slaves) such that I would punish them without them having committed a crime."
يَوْمَ نَقُولُ لِجَهَنَّمَ هَلِ ٱمْتَلأَتِ وَتَقُولُ هَلْ مِن مَّزِيدٍ,"(On the day) this is the Day of Judgement (when We say unto hell: Art thou filled) as I have promised? (and it saith: Can there be more to come?) and it will have more; and it is also said that hell will say: I am quite full, I do not have room even for one extra man."
وَأُزْلِفَتِ ٱلْجَنَّةُ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ غَيْرَ بَعِيدٍ,"(And the Garden is brought nigh for those who kept from evil) those who warded off disbelief, idolatry and indecencies, (no longer distant) from them."
هَـٰذَا مَا تُوعَدُونَ لِكُلِّ أَوَّابٍ حَفِيظٍ,"((And it is said): That) reward and honour (is that which ye were promised) in the life of the world. ((It is) for every penitent) who turns to Allah and His obedience (and heedful one) observant of Allah's command in his private moment; and it is also said: in his prayers,"

ٱدْخُلُوهَا بِسَلاَمٍ ذَلِكَ يَوْمُ ٱلُخُلُودِ,Allah will say to them: (Enter it) i.e. Paradise (in peace) in safety from Allah's chastisement. (This is the day of immortality) the day when the dwellers of Paradise will enter Paradise to abide therein for eternity.
لَهُم مَّا يَشَآءُونَ فِيهَا وَلَدَيْنَا مَزِيدٌ,"(There) in Paradise (they have all that they desire, and there is more with Us) i.e. beholding Allah's Countenance; and it is said that this means: in every hour and in every day, they have with Us an increase in honour and reward."
وَكَمْ أَهْلَكْنَا قَبْلَهُمْ مِّن قَرْنٍ هُمْ أَشَدُّ مِنْهُم بَطْشاً فَنَقَّبُواْ فِي ٱلْبِلاَدِ هَلْ مِن مَّحِيصٍ,"(And how many a generation) past generation (We destroyed before them) before your folk, (who were mightier than these) than your folk (in prowess) in physical strength (so that they overran the lands!) they moved about and travelled for their trade (Had they any place of refuge) or escape from Our chastisement? And it is also said this means: is there anyone of them left?"
إِنَّ فِي ذَلِكَ لَذِكْرَىٰ لِمَن كَانَ لَهُ قَلْبٌ أَوْ أَلْقَى ٱلسَّمْعَ وَهُوَ شَهِيدٌ,"(Lo! Therein) in that which was done with them (verily is a reminder) for your folk (for him who hath a heart) a living heart, (or giveth ear) or listens to the Qur'an (with full intelligence) with focus and not absentmindedly."
وَلَقَدْ خَلَقْنَا ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضَ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا فِي سِتَّةِ أَيَّامٍ وَمَا مَسَّنَا مِن لُّغُوبٍ,"(And verily We created the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them) of created beings and marvels, (in six Days) of the days of the beginning of the life of the world, each day the equivalent of 1,000 years of present days, the first day being Sunday and the last Friday, (and naught of weariness touched Us) We were not tired as claimed by the Jews who said: when Allah finished the creation of the heavens and earth, he put one leg on the other and rested on Saturday. The enemies of Allah have lied against Allah."
فَٱصْبِرْ عَلَىٰ مَا يَقُولُونَ وَسَبِّحْ بِحَمْدِ رَبِّكَ قَبْلَ طُلُوعِ ٱلشَّمْسِ وَقَبْلَ ٱلْغُرُوبِ,(Therefore) O Muhammad (bear with what they say) bear with the lies of the Jews; it is also said this means: bear with what the deriders say; these are five people whom we have already mentioned somewhere else: (and hymn the praise of thy Lord) pray by the command of your Lord (before the rising) this is the morning prayer (and before the setting of the sun) these are the Zuhr and 'Asr prayers;
وَمِنَ ٱللَّيْلِ فَسَبِّحْهُ وَأَدْبَارَ ٱلسُّجُودِ,(And in the night time hymn His praise) pray for Him the prayers of Maghrib and 'Isha' or the prayer of tahajjud: (And after the (prescribed) prostrations) two units of prayer after the Maghrib.
وَٱسْتَمِعْ يَوْمَ يُنَادِ ٱلْمُنَادِ مِن مَّكَانٍ قَرِيبٍ,"(And listen on) O Muhammad, so that you can hear the description of it; it is also said that this means: strive, O Muhammad, for the day when the angel blows the Trumpet (the day when the crier crieth from a near place) close to heaven, from the dome of Jerusalem, which is the closest spot on earth to heaven by about 12 miles; and it is also said this means: from a close distance from which they can hear from beneath their feet."
يَوْمَ يَسْمَعُونَ ٱلصَّيْحَةَ بِٱلْحَقِّ ذَلِكَ يَوْمُ ٱلْخُرُوجِ,(The day when they will hear the (Awful) Cry in truth) coming forth from the graves. (That is the day of coming forth (from the graves)) which is the Day of Judgement.

نَّحْنُ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا يَقُولُونَ وَمَآ أَنتَ عَلَيْهِمْ بِجَبَّارٍ فَذَكِّرْ بِٱلْقُرْآنِ مَن يَخَافُ وَعِيدِ,"We are best aware of what they say) concerning the resurrection; and it is said: of what they say in the life of the world, (and thou) O Muhammad (art in nowise a compeller over them) such that you force them to accept faith; but later on Allah commanded him to fight them. (But warn) admonish (by the Qur'an him who feareth My threat) for only he who fears My chastisement in the Hereafter will accept your admonition'."
وَٱلذَّارِيَاتِ ذَرْواً,"And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said in the interpretation of Allah's saying (By those that winnow with a winnowing): '(By those that winnow with a winnowing) He says: Allah swears by the blowing winds and that which they carry into the homes of people,"
فَٱلْحَامِلاَتِ وِقْراً,"(And those that bear the burden (of the rain)) and He swears by the heavy clouds which carry rain,"

فَٱلْمُقَسِّمَاتِ أَمْراً,"(And those who distribute (blessings) by command) and swears by the angels Gabriel, Michael, Seraphiel and the angel of death who apportion [provisions] for people: Allah swore by all these,"
إِنَّمَا تُوعَدُونَ لَصَادِقٌ,"(Lo! that wherewith ye are threatened) regarding the resurrection (is indeed true) will indeed take place,"
وَإِنَّ ٱلدِّينَ لَوَٱقِعٌ,"(And lo! the judgement) reckoning, judgement and retaliation in it (will indeed befall) and happen."
وَٱلسَّمَآءِ ذَاتِ ٱلْحُبُكِ,"(By the heaven full of paths) this is another oath; Allah swears by the seemly and beautiful heaven that has paths; it is also said that full of paths means: it has stars, the sun, the moon; and it is also said that full of paths means: full of waves like those of water upon being hit by the wind, or like the waves of sand upon being blown by the wind, or like the waves of curly hair or the waves of armour made of iron; and it is also said this refers to the seven heaven by which Allah has sworn."
إِنَّكُمْ لَفِي قَوْلٍ مُّخْتَلِفٍ,"(Lo! Ye) O people of Mecca, (forsooth, are of various opinion (concerning the Truth)) some of you believe in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an and some of you disbelieve in them."
يُؤْفَكُ عَنْهُ مَنْ أُفِكَ,"(He is made to turn away from it) he is made to turn away from Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an (who is (himself) averse) who is barred from the Truth and guidance, i.e. al-Walid Ibn al-Mughirah al-Makhzumi, Abu Jahl Ibn Hisham, Ubayy Ibn Khalaf, Umayyah Ibn Khalaf and Munbih and Nabih the sons of al-Hajjaj. They turned people away from Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an and so Allah cursed them."
قُتِلَ ٱلْخَرَّاصُونَ,Allah said: (Accursed be the conjecturers) accursed are the liars of the Banu Makhzum: al-Walid Ibn al-Mughirah and his host
ٱلَّذِينَ هُمْ فِي غَمْرَةٍ سَاهُونَ,(Who are careless) oblivious to believing in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an (in an abyss!) in ignorance and blindness concerning the Hereafter.
يَسْأَلُونَ أَيَّانَ يَوْمُ ٱلدِّينِ,"(They) the Banu Makhzum (ask) you, O Muhammad: (When is the Day of Judgement) in which we will be chastised?"
يَوْمَ هُمْ عَلَى ٱلنَّارِ يُفْتَنُونَ,"Allah said: ((It is) the day) the Day of Judgement (when they will be tormented at the Fire) they will be burnt in the Fire; it is also said this means: they will be made to roast in the Fire; and it is also said that this means: they will be dragged into the Fire,"

إِنَّ ٱلْمُتَّقِينَ فِي جَنَّاتٍ وَعُيُونٍ,"Then Allah explained the abode of the believers, like Abu Bakr and his fellow believers, saying: (Lo! those who keep from evil) those who ward off disbelief, idolatry and indecencies (will dwell amid Gardens and watersprings) of pure water."
آخِذِينَ مَآ آتَاهُمْ رَبُّهُمْ إِنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ قَبْلَ ذَلِكَ مُحْسِنِينَ,(Taking) content and pleased with (that which their Lord giveth them) in the Garden and it is also said that this means: they act upon that which their Lord commands them in the life of the world; (for lo! aforetime) before they were given this reward and honour (they were doers of good) they were good in their speech and action in the life of the world;
كَانُواْ قَلِيلاً مِّن ٱللَّيْلِ مَا يَهْجَعُونَ,"(They used to sleep but little of the night) He says: they hardly slept at night,"

وَفِيۤ أَمْوَالِهِمْ حَقٌّ لَّلسَّآئِلِ وَٱلْمَحْرُومِ,(And in their wealth the beggar) who asks from people (the outcast) he who does not beg from people nor is he given and nor do people realise he is in need; it is also said that the outcast means: the one whose wage and spoils are denied; and it is said that this means: the one who has a trade but whose life is hard and cannot earn his day's sufficiency (had due share) had an acknowledged right.
وَفِي ٱلأَرْضِ آيَاتٌ لِّلْمُوقِنِينَ,"(And in the earth are portents) signs and lessons, like the trees, beasts, mountains and seas (for those whose faith is sure) for those who have certainty in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an,"
وَفِيۤ أَنفُسِكُمْ أَفَلاَ تُبْصِرُونَ,"(And (also) in yourselves) there are signs and lessons such as pain, sickness and misfortune. A person for example administers his food and drink from one place but they come out from two different places. (Can ye then not see?) Do you then not perceive such that you reflect upon that which Allah has created?"
وَفِي ٱلسَّمَآءِ رِزْقُكُمْ وَمَا تُوعَدُونَ,"(And in the heaven is your providence) and from the heaven comes your provision, i.e. rain (and that which ye are promised) i.e. the Garden; your provision is upon the Lord of heaven just as what you are promised of reward and punishment is upon Allah;"

This is the House that Adam built and was raised to the seventh heaven because of the flood, it is called al-dirah and is opposite of the Ka'bah."
وَٱلسَّقْفِ ٱلْمَرْفُوعِ,"(And the roof exalted) and He swore by the heaven which is raised above everything,"
وَٱلْبَحْرِ ٱلْمَسْجُورِ,"(And the sea kept filled) and He swore by the full sea which is above the seventh heaven under the Throne of the Beneficent and which is called Life (al-Hayawan). Through it Allah will bring to life, on the Day of Judgement, all created beings. It is also said that 'the sea kept filled' is a hot sea which will become fire and will be opened in Gehenna on the Day of Judgement. Allah swore by all these things,"
إِنَّ عَذَابَ رَبِّكَ لَوَاقِعٌ,(Lo! the doom of thy Lord) on the Day of Judgement (will surely come to pass) will surely take place in relation to Quraysh;
مَّا لَهُ مِن دَافِعٍ,(There is none that can ward it off) there is none that can prevent this torment.
يَوْمَ تَمُورُ ٱلسَّمَآءُ مَوْراً,"(On the day when the heaven will heave) will rotate (with (awful) heaving) with its inhabitants on like the rotation of a millstone, and created beings will surge on each other because of the terror they see."
وَتَسِيرُ ٱلْجِبَالُ سَيْراً,"(And the mountains move away) on the surface of the earth (with (awful) movement) like the movement of the clouds in the sky,"
فَوَيْلٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُكَذِّبِينَ,(Then woe) then severe chastisement (that day) which is the Day of Judgement (unto the deniers) of Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an; the reference here is to Abu Jahl and his host
ٱلَّذِينَ هُمْ فِي خَوْضٍ يَلْعَبُونَ,(Who play in talk of grave matters) who engage in falsehood;
يَوْمَ يُدَعُّونَ إِلَىٰ نَارِ جَهَنَّمَ دَعًّا,(The day when they are thrust with a (disdainful) thrust into the Fire of hell) the angels drag them on their faces and thrust them in Gehenna.
هَـٰذِهِ ٱلنَّارُ ٱلَّتِي كُنتُم بِهَا تُكَذِّبُونَ,The angels in-charge of hell will say to them: (This is the Fire which ye were wont to deny) in the life of the world.
أَفَسِحْرٌ هَـٰذَا أَمْ أَنتُمْ لاَ تُبْصِرُونَ,"(Is this magic) is this Day and its torment magic, since you said in the life of the world to the messengers that they were wizards, (or do ye not see) or do you not perceive?"

(Ye are only being paid for what ye used to do) and say in the life of the world."
إِنَّ ٱلْمُتَّقِينَ فِي جَنَّاتٍ وَنَعِيمٍ,"Allah then showed the abode of the believers, Abu Bakr and his fellow believers, saying: (Lo! those who kept their duty) those who ward off disbelief, idolatry and indecencies (dwell in Gardens and delight) eternally,"

We made their fathers follow them. It is also said that this means: We make the offspring attain to the same rank as that of the fathers, if the ranks of the fathers are higher, (and We deprive them of naught of their (life's) work) He says: We do not diminish the reward of the fathers at all upon making their offspring join them. (Every man is a pledge) such that Allah does with him as He will (for that which he hath earned) of sins."
وَأَمْدَدْنَاهُم بِفَاكِهَةٍ وَلَحْمٍ مِّمَّا يَشْتَهُونَ,(And We provide them) i.e. We provided the inhabitants of the Garden in the Garden (with fruit) with different kinds of fruit (and meat) i.e. birds' meat (such as they desire.

أَمْ خَلَقُواْ ٱلسَّمَاوَاتِ وَٱلأَرْضَ بَل لاَّ يُوقِنُونَ,"(Or did they create the heavens and the earth?) It is Allah Who created them. (Nay, but they are sure of nothing!) but they deny Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an."
أَمْ عِندَهُمْ خَزَآئِنُ رَبِّكَ أَمْ هُمُ ٱلْمُصَيْطِرُونَ,"(Or do they own the treasures of thy Lord) or do they possess the stores of your Lord through rain, provision, vegetation and prophethood? (Or have they been given charge (thereof)?"

وَٱصْبِرْ لِحُكْمِ رَبِّكَ فَإِنَّكَ بِأَعْيُنِنَا وَسَبِّحْ بِحَمْدِ رَبِّكَ حِينَ تَقُومُ,"(So wait patiently (O Muhammad) for your Lord's decree) upon conveying the message of your Lord; and it is said this means: be content with the decree of your Lord regarding that which befalls you in the course of obeying your Lord, (for surely thou art in Our sight; and hymn the praise of thy Lord) pray by the command of your Lord (when thou uprisest) from your bed for the Fajr prayer."
وَمِنَ ٱللَّيْلِ فَسَبِّحْهُ وَإِدْبَارَ ٱلنُّجُومِ,"(And in the night time) upon the advent of the night (also hymn His praise) pray for Him the prayer of Zuhr, 'Asr, Maghrib and 'Isha', (and at the setting of the stars) two units of prayers after Fajr, and the setting of the star when it goes down'."
وَٱلنَّجْمِ إِذَا هَوَىٰ,"And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said regarding the interpretation of Allah's saying (By the Najm when it setteth): '(By the Najm when it setteth) He says: Allah swears by the Qur'an when Gabriel takes it down to Muhammad in instalments (nujuman): one, two, three or four verses at a time. There was a 20 years interval between the first and last verses. When this verse was revealed, 'Utbah Ibn Abi Lahab heard that the Prophet (pbuh) swore by the revelation of the Qur'an in instalment and so he said: “Tell Muhammad that I disbelieve in the instalments of the Qur'an”. When the Prophet (pbuh) was informed of this, he prayed: “O Allah! Set on him one of Your wild beasts”. Later, Allah set on him a lion near Harran that snatched him from among his friends and took him to a place nearby. It tore him apart from head to foot but did not eat him because of his impurity, just as the Prophet (pbuh) had prayed against him. It is also said here Allah swore by the stars when they set,"
مَا ضَلَّ صَاحِبُكُمْ وَمَا غَوَىٰ,"(Your comrade erreth not) this is the reason why Allah made the above oath: your Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) did not lie about what he said to you, (nor is deceived) he is not wrong nor did he err in what he said;"
وَمَا يَنطِقُ عَنِ ٱلْهَوَىٰ,(Nor doth he speak of (his own) desire) he did not utter the Qur'an of his own desire.
إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ وَحْيٌ يُوحَىٰ,"(It is) i.e. the Qur'an (naught save an inspiration) from Allah (that is inspired) to him through Gabriel who comes and recites it to him,"
عَلَّمَهُ شَدِيدُ ٱلْقُوَىٰ,"(Which one of mighty powers hath taught him) Gabriel taught him,"
ذُو مِرَّةٍ فَٱسْتَوَىٰ,"(One vigorous) one strong; it is also said this means: one mighty, for his strength was such that he put his hand under the townships of Lot and pulled them out, raised them to the sky and threw them upside down to the ground. His strength was also such that he seized the sides of the gate of Antioch and cried one cry that killed all the living creatures in it. It is also said that his strength was such that he spread one of his feathers on a hill in Jerusalem and struck with it Iblis who was at the farthest corner of India; (and he grew clear to view) Gabriel appeared in the form in which Allah created it him; and it is also said: he appeared in a beautiful form."
وَهُوَ بِٱلأُفُقِ ٱلأَعْلَىٰ,(When he was on the uppermost horizon) at the setting place of the sun; and it is said: at the seventh heaven.
ثُمَّ دَنَا فَتَدَلَّىٰ,"(Then he drew nigh) Gabriel drew near Muhammad (pbuh); and it is said: Muhammad (pbuh) drew near to his Lord (and came down) closer,"
فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَىٰ,"(Till he was (distant) two bows length) of the bows used by the Arabs (or even nearer) nearer by half a bow length,"
فَأَوْحَىٰ إِلَىٰ عَبْدِهِ مَآ أَوْحَىٰ,(And He revealed unto His slave) Gabriel (that which He revealed) to His slave Muhammad (pbuh); and it is said this means: and He revealed to His slave Muhammad (pbuh) that which He revealed.
مَا كَذَبَ ٱلْفُؤَادُ مَا رَأَىٰ,(The heart) of Muhammad (pbuh) (lied not (in seeing) what it saw) when he saw his Lord with his heart; it is also said that he saw his Lord with his eyes. This is why Allah made His oath.
أَفَتُمَارُونَهُ عَلَىٰ مَا يَرَىٰ,"When the Prophet (pbuh) informed them of what he saw, they disbelieved him. And so Allah said: (Will ye then dispute with him concerning) will you then disbelieve (what he seeth) what Muhammad (pbuh) saw?"
وَلَقَدْ رَآهُ نَزْلَةً أُخْرَىٰ,"(And verily he saw him) i.e. Muhammad (pbuh) saw Gabriel; and it is said he saw his Lord with his heart; and it is said he saw his Lord with his eyes, (yet another time) other than the time about which he informed you,"
عِندَ سِدْرَةِ ٱلْمُنتَهَىٰ,"(By the lote tree of the utmost boundary) at which point every close angel and sent prophet stops; it is also said that this means: the knowledge of every close angel and sent prophet and firm-footed scholar stops at this point,"
عِندَهَا جَنَّةُ ٱلْمَأْوَىٰ,(Nigh unto which is the Garden of Abode) wherein the spirits of martyrs abide.
إِذْ يَغْشَىٰ ٱلسِّدْرَةَ مَا يَغْشَىٰ,"(When that which shroudeth did enshroud the lote tree) when the angels enshroud the lote tree; and it is said this means: when the light enshrouds the lote tree; and it is also said that this means: when a canopy of gold enshrouds the lote tree,"
مَا زَاغَ ٱلْبَصَرُ وَمَا طَغَىٰ,(The eye turned not aside) the sight of Muhammad (pbuh) did not turn right or left because of what he saw (nor yet was overbold) due to what he saw; he saw that Gabriel had 600 wings.
لَقَدْ رَأَىٰ مِنْ آيَاتِ رَبِّهِ ٱلْكُبْرَىٰ,(Verily he) i.e. Muhammad (pbuh) (saw one of the greater revelations of his Lord) he saw one of the greatest marvels of his Lord.
أَفَرَأَيْتُمُ ٱللاَّتَ وَٱلْعُزَّىٰ,(Have ye) O people of Mecca (thought upon al-Lat and al-'Uzza
وَمَنَاةَ ٱلثَّالِثَةَ ٱلأُخْرَىٰ,"And Manat, the third, the other) will benefit you in the Hereafter? It will not benefit them. It is also said that the verse means: do you deem that your worship of al-Lat, al-'Uzza and Manat in the life of the world will benefit you in the Hereafter. No, it will surely not benefit you. As for al-Lat it was an idol which was worshipped in Thaqif; al-'Uzza was a tree in Batn al-Nakhlah which Ghatafan worshipped; while Manat was an idol in Mecca which was worshipped beside Allah by Hudhayl and Khuza'ah."
أَلَكُمُ ٱلذَّكَرُ وَلَهُ ٱلأُنْثَىٰ,"(Are yours the males) O people of Mecca, whom you are pleased to have for yourselves (and His the females) despite the fact that you dislike them and will not be pleased to have them for yourselves?"

(They follow) they do not worship al-Lat, al-'Uzza and Manat or that which they call deities (but a guess) except through surmise and have no certainty about their worship (and that which (they) themselves desire) and they also worship them because they follow their own desires. (And now the guidance from their Lord) the explanation in the Qur'an that Allah has no son or partner (hath come unto them) to the people of Mecca."
أَمْ لِلإِنسَانِ مَا تَمَنَّىٰ,(Or shall man) the people of Mecca (have what he coveteth) i.e. that the idols and angels will intercede for them?

وَمَا لَهُم بِهِ مِنْ عِلْمٍ إِن يَتَّبِعُونَ إِلاَّ ٱلظَّنَّ وَإِنَّ ٱلظَّنَّ لاَ يُغْنِي مِنَ ٱلْحَقِّ شَيْئاً,"(And they have no knowledge thereof) they have no proof or elucidation about what they say. (They follow but a guess) they lie out of surmise and do not have any certainty, (and lo! a guess) and worship based on guess and claims based on guess (can never take the place of the Truth) cannot spare one from Allah's chastisement."

(Lo! thy Lord) O Muhammad (is best aware of him who strayeth) from His religion, in reference here to Abu Jahl, (and He is best aware of him who goeth right) to His religion, in reference here to Abu Bakr."
وَلِلَّهِ مَا فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِي ٱلأَرْضِ لِيَجْزِيَ ٱلَّذِينَ أَسَاءُواْ بِمَا عَمِلُواْ وَيَجْزِيَ ٱلَّذِينَ أَحْسَنُواْ بِٱلْحُسْنَى,"(And Unto Allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens) of creation (and whatsoever is in the earth) of created beings; they are all slaves of Allah, (that He may reward those who do evil) those ascribe partners to Allah (with that which they have done) in their state of idolatry, (and reward those who do good) those who believe in Allah's divine Oneness (with goodness) with the Garden."

(He is best aware of you) than your own selves (when He created you from the earth) He created you from Adam and Adam is from dust and dust is from the earth, (and when ye were) small (hidden in the bellies of your mothers) Allah knew in these circumstances what will ensue from you. (Therefore ascribe not purity unto yourselves) do not absolve yourselves from committing sins. (He is best aware of him who wardeth off (evil)) transgression and does good."
أَفَرَأَيْتَ ٱلَّذِي تَوَلَّىٰ,(Didst thou (O Muhammad) observe him who turned away) from spending and giving alms to the poor among the Companions of the Prophet (pbuh)
وَأَعْطَىٰ قَلِيلاً وَأَكْدَىٰ,"(And gave a little) for the sake of Allah, (then was grudging) then stopped his spending and almsgiving in the way of Allah?"
أَعِندَهُ عِلْمُ ٱلْغَيْبِ فَهُوَ يَرَىٰ,"(Hath he knowledge of the Unseen) the Guarded Tablet (so that he seeth) his doing in it that it is indeed as he did? This verse was revealed about 'Uthman Ibn 'Affan who was of the habit of spending a great deal on, and gives alms to, the Companions of the Prophet (pbuh) but then he met 'Abdullah Ibn Sa'd Ibn Abi Sarh. The latter said to him: "" I see that you spend a great deal on these, and I fear that you may be left with nothing "". 'Uthman said to him: "" I have faults and sins which I want to expiate and I also want to obtain Allah's good pleasure "". 'Abdullah said: "" Give me the halter of your camel and I will bear your sins and faults in this life and in the Hereafter "". As a result, he gave him the halter of his camel and confided himself to spending on him. It is because of this that this verse was revealed."
أَمْ لَمْ يُنَبَّأْ بِمَا فِي صُحُفِ مُوسَىٰ,(Or hath he not had news) has he not been informed in the Qur'an (of what is in the books of Moses) He says: in the Torah and the scrolls of Abraham.
وَإِبْرَاهِيمَ ٱلَّذِي وَفَّىٰ,(And Abraham who paid his debt) i.e. he conveyed the message of his Lord and acted upon that which Allah had commanded him; it is also said that this means: he did as he was told in his dream vision:
أَلاَّ تَزِرُ وَازِرَةٌ وِزْرَ أُخْرَىٰ,"(That no laden one shall bear another's load) that no bearer shall bear the sins of another; it is also said that this means: no soul shall be tormented for the sins of another soul,"

هَـٰذَا نَذِيرٌ مِّنَ ٱلنُّذُرِ ٱلأُوْلَىٰ,"(This is a warner) i.e. Muhammad (pbuh) is a warning Messenger (of the warners of old) like the earlier messengers whom We sent to their folks; it is also said that this means: this is a messenger among the messengers of old whom it is written, in the Guarded Tablet, that We would sent to their folks."
أَزِفَتِ ٱلآزِفَةُ,(The threatened Hour is nigh) the advent of the Hour is close.

ٱقْتَرَبَتِ ٱلسَّاعَةُ وَٱنشَقَّ ٱلْقَمَرُ,And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said in the interpretation of Allah's saying (The hour drew nigh): '(The hour drew nigh) He says: the coming of the Hour drew nigh by the advent of Muhammad (pbuh) and the coming down of the smock (and the moon was rent in twain) this is also another sign of the closeness of the Day of Judgement.
وَإِن يَرَوْاْ آيَةً يُعْرِضُواْ وَيَقُولُواْ سِحْرٌ مُّسْتَمِرٌّ,(And if they behold a portent) like the splitting of the moon (they turn away) they deny the sign (and say:) this sign is nothing but (Prolonged illusion) which will vanish.

حِكْمَةٌ بَالِغَةٌ فَمَا تُغْنِ ٱلنُّذُرُ,(Effective) is the (wisdom) of the Qur'an; it is wisdom from Allah which they were conveyed on behalf of Allah; (but warnings) i.e. the messengers (avail not) the people who disbelieve in Allah as it is in His preeternal knowledge.

(it will be said) the believers will say to them; and it is said: the angels will say to them; and it is said Allah will say to them: (Go back) to the life of the world; and it is said this means: go back to the stopping-place where we were given light (and seek for light!) This is said to the hypocrites out of mockery by Allah; and it is also said that this is said by the believers; and so the hypocrites will go back seeking light. (Then there will separate them) i.e. the believers and the hypocrites (a wall wherein is a gate, the inner side whereof containeth mercy) Paradise, (while the outer side thereof is towards the doom) towards hell."

(And in the Hereafter there is grievous punishment) for he who abstains from obeying Allah and withholds the right of Allah, (and (also) forgiveness from Allah and His good pleasure) in the Hereafter, for he who obeys Allah and fulfils Allah's right over his wealth, (whereas the life of the world) i.e. concerning its lastingness and evanescence (is but matter of illusion) like the illusion surrounding the utilities of the house such as plates and bowls."

قَدْ سَمِعَ ٱللَّهُ قَوْلَ ٱلَّتِي تُجَادِلُكَ فِي زَوْجِهَا وَتَشْتَكِيۤ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ وَٱللَّهُ يَسْمَعُ تَحَاوُرَكُمآ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ سَمِيعٌ بَصِيرٌ,"And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said concerning the interpretation of Allah's saying (Allah hath heard): '(Allah hath heard) He says: Allah heard before He informed you, O Muhammad, (the saying of her that disputeth) that speaks to and argues (with thee (Muhammad) concerning her husband, and complaineth unto Allah) and entreats Allah, Exalted is He, to explain her matter. (And Allah heareth your colloquy) and Allah hears your conversation and exchange of words. (Lo! Allah is Hearer) of your conversation, (Knower) of her matter. The story is that Khawlah Bint Tha'labah Ibn Malik Ibn al-Dakhshim al-Ansariyyah was married to Aws Ibn al-Samit al-Ansari and the latter, who was touched by the jinn, wanted to have sexual intercourse with her while in her period. When she refused, he became angry and said: “if you leave the house before I have sexual intercourse with you, you are unlawful to me just as my mother is”."

And lo! Allah is Forgiving) since He did not punish him for declaring unlawful that which Allah made lawful, (Merciful) after he has repented and shown remorse."
وَٱلَّذِينَ يُظَاهِرُونَ مِن نِّسَآئِهِمْ ثُمَّ يَعُودُونَ لِمَا قَالُواْ فَتَحْرِيرُ رَقَبَةٍ مِّن قَبْلِ أَن يَتَمَآسَّا ذَلِكُمْ تُوعَظُونَ بِهِ وَٱللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيرٌ,"Allah explained the expiation for saying to one's wife: “you are unlawful to me just like my mother is” (Zihar), saying: (Those who put away their wives (by saying they are as their mothers)) those who make unlawful for themselves sexual intercourse with their wives (and afterward would go back on that which they have said) then go back on making it lawful; ((the penalty) in that case (is) the freeing of a slave before they touch one another. Unto this) freeing of a slave (ye are exhorted) as an expiation of the Zihar; (and Allah is informed of what ye do) regarding the Zihar, of expiation and other things."
فَمَن لَّمْ يَجِدْ فَصِيَامُ شَهْرَيْنِ مُتَتَابِعَيْنِ مِن قَبْلِ أَن يَتَمَآسَّا فَمَن لَّمْ يَسْتَطِعْ فَإِطْعَامُ سِتِّينَ مِسْكِيناً ذَلِكَ لِتُؤْمِنُواْ بِٱللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ وَتِلْكَ حُدُودُ ٱللَّهِ وَلِلْكَافِرِينَ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,"(And he who findeth not (the wherewithal)) the means to free a slave, (let him fast for two successive months before they touch one another) before they have sexual intercourse with one another; (and for him who is unable to do so) i.e. to fast because he is weak ((the penance is) the feeding of sixty needy ones) giving each needy person half a measure (half a sa') of wheat or one measure (sa') of barley or dates. (This) which I have explained regarding the expiation of the Zihar, (that ye may put trust in Allah and His messenger) in order that you acknowledge the obligations of Allah and the wont of His Messenger. (Such are the limits (imposed by Allah)) such are the legal rulings and obligations of Allah regarding the Zihar; (and for disbelievers) in the limits imposed by Allah (is a painful doom) whose pain will extend to their hearts. From the beginning of the surah to this point was revealed about Khawlah Bint Tha'labah Ibn Malik al-Ansariyyah and her husband Aws Ibn al-Samit, the brother of 'Ubadah Ibn al-Samit, who was angered by his wife for refusing him to sleep with her and, as a result, made sexual intercourse with her forbidden on him. But he regretted doing so, and Allah revealed how he could expiate the sin he committed. The Prophet (pbuh) told him: “You should free a slave”. Aws said: “I have very little money and it costs a great deal to free a slave”. The Prophet (pbuh) said: “Then you should fast two successive months”. Aws said: “I cannot do so! If I do not eat once or twice a day my eyesight becomes dim; and I fear peril if I fast”. The Prophet (pbuh) said: “Then you should feed 60 needy ones”. Aws said: “I can not afford it”. The Prophet (pbuh) ordered for him a measure of dates and commanded him to give it to the needy. Aws said: “I do not know of anyone in Medina who is more in need of it than I”. The Prophet (pbuh) told him to eat it and, with the help of another person, the Prophet (pbuh) fed 60 needy people, and this allowed Aws to go back to his wife whom he had declared unlawful for himself."

يَوْمَ يَبْعَثُهُمُ ٱللَّهُ جَمِيعاً فَيُنَبِّئُهُمْ بِمَا عَمِلُوۤاْ أَحْصَاهُ ٱللَّهُ وَنَسُوهُ وَٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ شَهِيدٌ,(On the day when Allah will raise them all together) will raise the adherents of all religions (and inform them of what they did) in the life of the world. (Allah hath kept account of it) i.e. He has kept account of all their works (while they forgot it) while they left the obedience of Allah with which they were commanded. (And Allah is Witness over all things) over all their works.
أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَعْلَمُ مَا فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِي ٱلأَرْضِ مَا يَكُونُ مِن نَّجْوَىٰ ثَلاَثَةٍ إِلاَّ هُوَ رَابِعُهُمْ وَلاَ خَمْسَةٍ إِلاَّ هُوَ سَادِسُهُمْ وَلاَ أَدْنَىٰ مِن ذَلِكَ وَلاَ أَكْثَرَ إِلاَّ هُوَ مَعَهُمْ أَيْنَ مَا كَانُواْ ثُمَّ يُنَبِّئُهُم بِمَا عَمِلُواْ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عَلِيمٌ,"(Hast thou not seen) have you not been informed, O Muhammad, in the Qur'an (that Allah knoweth all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth) of creation? (There is no secret conference of three but He is their fourth) except that Allah knows about them, their works and secret conference, (nor of five but He is their sixth) He knows them and knows their secret conference, (nor of less than that or more but He is with them) He knows them and knows their secret conference (wheresoever they may be; and afterward, on the Day of Resurrection, He will inform them of what they did) in the life of the world. (Lo! Allah is Knower of all things) of their works and secret conference. This verse was revealed about Safwan Ibn Umayyah and his son-in-law; their story is mentioned in the Surah of Prostration."

What happened is that the hypocrites used to hold secret conferences with the Jews regarding the military expeditions of the believers, in order to aggrieve the believers. (And when they) i.e. the Jews (come unto thee they greet thee with a greeting wherewith Allah greeteth thee not) for they used to say al-sam, i.e. death, be with you [that is instead of saying al-salam, i.e. peace, be with you] and the Prophet (pbuh) used to answer: “and al-sam be with you”, (and say within themselves) to one another: (Why should Allah punish us for what we say) to His Prophet? If he were truly a Prophet, as he claims, his prayer would have been answered when he answers: “and al-sam be with you”. Allah answered them, saying: (Hell will suffice them) i.e. the Jews as a destination in the Hereafter; (they will feel the heat thereof. A hapless journey's end) is hell wherein they will end!"
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُوۤاْ إِذَا تَنَاجَيْتُمْ فَلاَ تَتَنَاجَوْاْ بِٱلإِثْمِ وَٱلْعُدْوَانِ وَمَعْصِيَتِ ٱلرَّسُولِ وَتَنَاجَوْاْ بِٱلْبِرِّ وَٱلتَّقْوَىٰ وَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ ٱلَّذِيۤ إِلَيْهِ تُحْشَرُونَ,"(O ye who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an! (when ye conspire together) among yourselves, (conspire not together for crime) for lying (and wrong-doing) transgression (and disobedience towards the messenger) by opposing the Messenger like the hypocrites did with the Jews, leaving aside the true believers, (but conspire together for righteousness) for performing the obligations of Allah and for being good towards one another (and pity) shunning transgressions and boycott, (and keep your duty) fear Allah for secret conferencing with other than the true believers, (towards Allah, unto whom ye will be gathered) in the Hereafter."
إِنَّمَا ٱلنَّجْوَىٰ مِنَ ٱلشَّيْطَانِ لِيَحْزُنَ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَلَيْسَ بِضَآرِّهِمْ شَيْئاً إِلاَّ بِإِذْنِ ٱللَّهِ وَعَلَى ٱللَّهِ فَلْيَتَوَكَّلِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ,"(Lo! Conspiracy) of the hypocrites with the Jews while leaving the true believers aside (is only of the devil) is of the obedience of Satan and by his command, (that he may vex those who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an; (but he can harm them) secret conference of the hypocrites will not harm the believers (not at all unless by Allah's leave) unless it is by Allah's will. (In Allah let believers put their trust) and let them not put it in other than Him."
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ إِذَا قِيلَ لَكُمْ تَفَسَّحُواْ فِي ٱلْمَجَالِسِ فَٱفْسَحُواْ يَفْسَحِ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمْ وَإِذَا قِيلَ ٱنشُزُواْ فَانشُزُواْ يَرْفَعِ ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ مِنكُمْ وَٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ ٱلْعِلْمَ دَرَجَاتٍ وَٱللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيرٌ,"(O ye who believe! When it is said) when the Prophet (pbuh) says: (Make room in assemblies, then make room; Allah will make way for you (Hereafter)) in the Hereafter. This was revealed about Thabit Ibn Qays Ibn Shammas whose story is mentioned in the Surah of the Private Apartments. It is also said it was revealed about a group of people from Badr, among whom were Thabit Ibn Qays Ibn Shammas. These people went to the Prophet (pbuh) on a Friday when he was staying in the apartment of his wife Safiyyah. When they could not find a place where to sit, they stood at the beginning of the assembly. So the Prophet (pbuh) addressed some people who were not among those who participated in the Battle of Badr: so-and-so and so-and-so and so-and-so let those who took part in the Battle of Badr sit in your places. This is because the Prophet (pbuh) used to honour all those who fought at the battle of Badr. But when he did that, he noticed that those who were made to give up their seats resented it, and so Allah revealed about them this verse. (And when it is said, Come up higher!) in prayer, jihad or remembrance (go up higher; Allah will exalt those who believe) in secret and openly (among you) in ranks, (and those who have knowledge) along with faith, (to high ranks) merits in Paradise, more than the merits given to those who have faith but have no knowledge. This is because a believer who is knowledgeable is better than a believer who is not. (Allah is informed of what ye do) of good or evil."
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ إِذَا نَاجَيْتُمُ ٱلرَّسُولَ فَقَدِّمُواْ بَيْنَ يَدَيْ نَجْوَاكُمْ صَدَقَةً ذَلِكَ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ وَأَطْهَرُ فَإِن لَّمْ تَجِدُواْ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"(O ye who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an! (When ye hold conference) when you speak (with the messenger, offer an alms before your conference). This was revealed about those believers who were well off and used to speak to the Prophet (pbuh) more than the poor believers, so much so that they vexed both the Prophet (pbuh) and the poor believers. Allah, therefore, forbade them from doing so and commanded them to give alms to the poor, one silver coin for each word they would say to him, before they even spoke with the Prophet (pbuh). (That) almsgiving (is better) than holding back money (and purer for you) and purer for your hearts from sins; and it is also said this means: it is purer for the hearts of the poor in that it prevents their hearts from becoming hard. (But if ye cannot find (the wherewithal)) to give alms, O poor believers, then you can speak with the Prophet (pbuh) as much as you wish without being required to give alms (then lo! Allah is Forgiving) He forgives your sins, (Merciful) towards the one among you who dies repentant."
ءَأَشْفَقْتُمْ أَن تُقَدِّمُواْ بَيْنَ يَدَيْ نَجْوَاكُمْ صَدَقَاتٍ فَإِذْ لَمْ تَفْعَلُواْ وَتَابَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْكُمْ فَأَقِيمُواْ ٱلصَّلاَةَ وَآتُواْ ٱلزَّكَاةَ وَأَطِيعُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ وَٱللَّهُ خَبِيرٌ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ,"When they stopped speaking with the Prophet (pbuh) because of the required almsgiving involved, Allah reproached them for doing so, saying: (Fear ye) are you miserly, O well off people, (to offer alms before your conference) to offer alms to the poor before speaking with the Prophet (pbuh)? (Then, when ye do it not) when you do not give alms (and Allah hath forgiven you) the question of giving alms, (establish worship) perform the five daily prayers (and pay the poor-due) from your wealth (and obey Allah) in that which He commands you (and His messenger) in that which he commands you. (And Allah is Aware of what ye do) whether it is good or evil. But no one gave alms for speaking with the Prophet (pbuh) except 'Ali Ibn Abi Talib who gave to alms a golden piece which he sold for ten silver pieces, and then asked the Prophet (pbuh) a question of ten words."
أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى ٱلَّذِينَ تَوَلَّوْاْ قَوْماً غَضِبَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْهِم مَّا هُم مِّنكُمْ وَلاَ مِنْهُمْ وَيَحْلِفُونَ عَلَى ٱلْكَذِبِ وَهُمْ يَعْلَمُونَ,"Allah then said about 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy and his host, because of their alliance with the Jews: (Hast thou not seen) O Muhammad (those who take for friends) for assistance and help (a folk) i.e. the Jews (with whom Allah is wroth? They) i.e. the hypocrites (are neither of you) in private such that what is due to you is due to them (nor of them) i.e. the Jews, openly such that whatever is due to the Jews is due to them, (and they swear a false oath) they falsely swear that they are believers and true in their faith (knowingly) while they know they are lying in their oath."
أَعَدَّ ٱللَّهُ لَهُمْ عَذَاباً شَدِيداً إِنَّهُمْ سَآءَ مَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ,(Allah hath prepared for them) for the hypocrites: 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy and his host (a dreadful doom) in the life of the world and in the Hereafter. (Evil indeed is that which they are wont to do) evil is that which they do in their state of hypocrisy.
ٱتَّخَذْوۤاْ أَيْمَانَهُمْ جُنَّةً فَصَدُّواْ عَن سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ فَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ مُّهِينٌ,(They make a shelter of their oaths) they lie in their oath in order not to be killed (and turn (men) from the way of Allah) they secretly turn people away from Allah's religion and obedience; (so theirs will be a shameful doom) with which they will be humiliated in the Hereafter.
لَّن تُغْنِيَ عَنْهُمْ أَمْوَالُهُمْ وَلاَ أَوْلاَدُهُمْ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ شَيْئاً أُوْلَـٰئِكَ أَصْحَابُ ٱلنَّارِ هُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ,"(Their wealth) the abundance of the wealth of the hypocrites and the Jews (and their children) and the abundance of their children (will avail them naught against Allah) against Allah's chastisement. (Such) the hypocrites and the Jews (are rightful owners of the Fire) the inhabitants of the Fire; (they will abide therein) for eternity, neither to die nor leave it."
يَوْمَ يَبْعَثُهُمُ ٱللَّهُ جَمِيعاً فَيَحْلِفُونَ لَهُ كَمَا يَحْلِفُونَ لَكُمْ وَيَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّهُمْ عَلَىٰ شَيْءٍ أَلاَ إِنَّهُمْ هُمُ ٱلْكَاذِبُونَ,"(On the day) the Day of Judgement (when Allah will raise them all together) the hypocrites and the Jews, (then will they swear unto Him) we were never hypocrites or disbelievers (as they (now) swear unto you) in the life of the world, (and they will fancy that they have some standing) with regard to religion. (Lo! is it not they who are the liars) in their oaths before Allah?"
ٱسْتَحْوَذَ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلشَّيْطَانُ فَأَنسَاهُمْ ذِكْرَ ٱللَّهِ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ حِزْبُ الشَّيْطَانِ أَلاَ إِنَّ حِزْبَ الشَّيْطَانِ هُمُ الخَاسِرُونَ,"(The devil hath engrossed them) Satan has conquered them and commanded them to obey him, and they did, (and so hath caused them to forget remembrance of Allah) until they left obeying Allah in private. (They) i.e. the hypocrites and the Jews (are the devil's party) the army of the devil. (Lo! is it not the devil's party) the devil's army (who will be the losers) of the life of the world and the Hereafter?"
إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يُحَآدُّونَ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ فِي ٱلأَذَلِّينَ,"(Lo! those who oppose) contravene (Allah and His messenger) in the matter of religion, (they will be among the lowest) in the Fire. The reference here is to the Jews and hypocrites."
كَتَبَ ٱللَّهُ لأَغْلِبَنَّ أَنَاْ وَرُسُلِيۤ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ قَوِيٌّ عَزِيزٌ,"(Allah hath decreed: Lo! I verily shall conquer, I and My messengers) i.e. Muhammad (pbuh) they shall conquer Persia, Byzantium, the hypocrites and the Jews. (Lo! Allah is Strong) through giving help to his prophets, (Almighty) in retribution against His enemies. This was revealed about 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy Ibn Salul who said to the true believers: “Do you really think that you shall conquer Persia and Byzantium?”."
لاَّ تَجِدُ قَوْماً يُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلآخِرِ يُوَآدُّونَ مَنْ حَآدَّ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ وَلَوْ كَانُوۤاْ آبَآءَهُمْ أَوْ أَبْنَآءَهُمْ أَوْ إِخْوَانَهُمْ أَوْ عَشِيرَتَهُمْ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ كَتَبَ فِي قُلُوبِهِمُ ٱلإِيمَانَ وَأَيَّدَهُمْ بِرُوحٍ مِّنْهُ وَيُدْخِلُهُمْ جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلأَنْهَارُ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا رَضِيَ ٱللَّهُ عَنْهُمْ وَرَضُواْ عَنْهُ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ حِزْبُ ٱللَّهِ أَلاَ إِنَّ حِزْبَ ٱللَّهِ هُمُ ٱلْمُفْلِحُونَ,"Allah then revealed about Hatib Ibn Abi Balta'ah, a man from the Yemen, who wrote a letter to the people of Mecca in which he divulged one of the secrets of the Prophet (pbuh) saying: (Thou wilt not find) O Muhammad (folk) i.e. Hatib (who believe in Allah and the Last Day) resurrection after death (loving those who oppose) contravene against (Allah and His messenger) in matters of religion, meaning here the people of Mecca: (even though they be their fathers) blood fathers (or, their sons or their brethren or their clan) or their own folk or relatives. (As for such) Hatib and his fellow believers, (He hath written faith upon their hearts) He cast love of faith in their hearts (and hath strengthened them with a Spirit from Him) with a mercy from Him; and it is said this means: He helped them with a help from Him, (and He will bring them into Gardens beneath which) beneath its trees and habitations (rivers flow) rivers of wine, water, honey and milk flow, (wherein they will abide) they will dwell in Paradise for eternity, never to die or leave it. (Allah is well pleased with them) because of their faith, works and repentance, (and they are well pleased with Him) because of the reward and honour they receive from Him. (They are Allah's party) they are Allah's army. (Lo! is it not Allah's party who are the successful?) they are saved from His wrath and chastisement; these are the ones who found and obtained what they were seeking, and were saved from the evil of that which they fled from. Hatib was of those who took part in the Battle of Badr, and his story is found in surah “She that is to be examined (al-Mumtahanah)”."
سَبَّحَ لِلَّهِ مَا فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَهُوَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ,"And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said about the interpretation of Allah's saying (All that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth glorifieth Allah): '(All that is in the heavens) He says: all that is in the heavens of creation (and all that is in the earth) of created beings (glorifieth Allah) pray to Allah; and it is also said this means: remember Allah, (and He is the Mighty) in His kingdom and dominion, (the Wise) in His command and decree; He commanded that none should be worshipped except Him."
هُوَ ٱلَّذِيۤ أَخْرَجَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِنْ أَهْلِ ٱلْكِتَابِ مِن دِيَارِهِمْ لأَوَّلِ ٱلْحَشْرِ مَا ظَنَنتُمْ أَن يَخْرُجُواْ وَظَنُّوۤاْ أَنَّهُمْ مَّانِعَتُهُمْ حُصُونُهُم مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ فَأَتَاهُمُ ٱللَّهُ مِنْ حَيْثُ لَمْ يَحْتَسِبُواْ وَقَذَفَ فِي قُلُوبِهِمُ ٱلرُّعْبَ يُخْرِبُونَ بُيُوتَهُمْ بِأَيْدِيهِمْ وَأَيْدِي ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ فَٱعْتَبِرُواْ يٰأُوْلِي ٱلأَبْصَارِ,"(He it is Who hath caused those of the People of the Scripture who disbelieved) i.e. Banu'l-Nadir (to go forth from their homes) and fortresses (unto the first exile) because they are the first to be gathered and exiled from Medina to Historic Syria, and specifically to Jericho and Adhri'at, as a result of breaking their covenants with the Prophet (pbuh) after the battle of Uhud. (Ye deemed not) you did not have any hope, O group of believers, (that they) i.e. Banu'l-Nadir (would go forth) from Medina to Historic Syria, (while they) the Banu'l-Nadir (deemed that their strongholds) their fortresses (would protect them from Allah) from Allah's chastisement. (But Allah reached them) Allah punished them and humiliated them through the killing of Ka'b Ibn al-Ashraf (from a place whereof they reckoned not) they did not think that Ka'b Ibn al-Ashraf would be killed nor did they have any fear regarding this, (and cast terror in their hearts) fear from Muhammad (pbuh) and his Companions, when they did not fear them at all before this (so that they ruined their houses) some of their houses (with their own hands) and throw its stones on the believers (and the hands of the believers) and they left some of their homes to the believers who destroyed them and threw their stones at them. (So learn a lesson, O ye who have eyes!) learn a lesson, O you who have insight in Religion, from what Allah has done to them concerning their exile."
وَلَوْلاَ أَن كَتَبَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلْجَلاَءَ لَعَذَّبَهُمْ فِي ٱلدُّنْيَا وَلَهُمْ فِي ٱلآخِرَةِ عَذَابُ ٱلنَّارِ,"(And if Allah had not decreed migration) from Medina to Historic Syria (for them) for the Banu'l-Nadir, (He verily would have punished them in this world) by exposing them to killing, (and theirs in the Hereafter is the punishment of the Fire) which is worse than being killed."
ذَلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ شَآقُّواْ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ وَمَن يُشَآقِّ ٱللَّهَ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ شَدِيدُ ٱلْعِقَابِ,"(That) exile and punishment (is because they were opposed to Allah and His messenger) concerning Religion; (and whoso is opposed to Allah) in the matter of religion and shows enmity towards Him, ((for him) verily Allah is stern in reprisal) in the life of the world as well as in the Hereafter."
مَا قَطَعْتُمْ مِّن لِّينَةٍ أَوْ تَرَكْتُمُوهَا قَآئِمَةً عَلَىٰ أُصُولِهَا فَبِإِذْنِ ٱللَّهِ وَلِيُخْزِيَ ٱلْفَاسِقِينَ,"The Prophet (pbuh) then ordered his Companions to cut down their palm-trees except a particular tree called the 'Ajwah, which he asked them not to cut down. When the Banu'l-Nadir reproached the believers for doing so, Allah revealed: (Whatsoever palm-trees you cut down) other than the 'Ajwah palm-tree (or left standing on their roots) and did not cut down, i.e. the 'Ajwah, (it was by Allah's leave) both commands of cutting down and not cutting down are from Allah, (in order that He might confound the evil-livers) in order that He might humiliate the disbelievers, i.e. the Banu'l-Nadir, through that which you have cut down of their palm-trees."
وَمَآ أَفَآءَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ رَسُولِهِ مِنْهُمْ فَمَآ أَوْجَفْتُمْ عَلَيْهِ مِنْ خَيْلٍ وَلاَ رِكَابٍ وَلَـٰكِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُسَلِّطُ رُسُلَهُ عَلَىٰ مَن يَشَآءُ وَٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,"(And that which Allah gave as spoil unto His messenger from them) from Banu'l-Nadir, it is solely for the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) and there is nothing in it for you, (ye urged not) you did not use (any horse or riding-camel for the sake thereof) but you walked to it, for it was very close to Medina, (but Allah giveth His messenger) Muhammad (pbuh) (lordship over whom He will) the Banu'l-Nadir. (Allah is Able to do all things) in terms of giving help and spoils."
مَّآ أَفَآءَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ رَسُولِهِ مِنْ أَهْلِ ٱلْقُرَىٰ فَلِلَّهِ وَلِلرَّسُولِ وَلِذِي ٱلْقُرْبَىٰ وَٱلْيَتَامَىٰ وَٱلْمَسَاكِينِ وَٱبْنِ ٱلسَّبِيلِ كَيْ لاَ يَكُونَ دُولَةً بَيْنَ ٱلأَغْنِيَآءِ مِنكُمْ وَمَآ آتَاكُمُ ٱلرَّسُولُ فَخُذُوهُ وَمَا نَهَاكُمْ عَنْهُ فَٱنتَهُواْ وَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ شَدِيدُ ٱلْعِقَابِ,"(That which Allah giveth as spoil unto His messenger from the people of the townships) of 'Uraynah, Qurayzah, Banu'l-Nadir, Fadak and Khaybar, (it is for Allah) specifically and there is nothing in it for you (and His messenger) the command of the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) regarding this is permissible, and this is why he made the spoils of Fadak and Khaybar an endowment for the needy people; it remained under his control during his lifetime, and after his death it came under the control of Abu Bakr al-Siddiq, and after him under 'Umar, 'Uthman and 'Ali respectively exactly as it was under the control of the Prophet (pbuh) and it remains so to this day. The Prophet (pbuh) also divided the spoils of Banu Qurayzah and Banu'l-Nadir on the poor from among the Emigrants (al-Muhajirun), he gave them according to their need and the need of their dependents (and for the near of kin) and he gave some of it to the needy among the Banu 'Abd al-Muttalib (and the orphans) and he gave some of it to the orphans, other than the orphans of Banu 'Abd al-Muttalib (and the needy) and gave some of it to the needy, other than the needy of the Banu 'Abd al-Muttalib (and the wayfarer) the guest and the passer-by, (that it become not a commodity) a division (between the rich among you) between the strong among you. (And whatsoever the messenger giveth you) of spoils, (take it) accept it; it is also said that this means: whatever the messenger commands you, act upon it. (And whatsoever he forbideth, abstain (from it). And keep your duty to Allah) fear Allah in that which He commanded you. (Lo! Allah is stern in reprisal) when He punishes; this is because they said to the Prophet (pbuh): “Take your share of the spoils and leave us to deal with the rest of it”."
لِلْفُقَرَآءِ الْمُهَاجِرِينَ الَّذِينَ أُخْرِجُواْ مِن دِيَارِهِمْ وَأَمْوَالِهِمْ يَبْتَغُونَ فَضْلاً مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَرِضْوَاناً وَيَنصُرُونَ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلصَّادِقُونَ,"Allah therefore said to them: these spoils-i.e. seven gardens that belonged to the Banu'l-Nadir-(And (it is) for the poor fugitives who have been driven out from their homes) because they were driven out of their homes in Mecca (and their belongings) the disbelievers of Mecca expelled them from Mecca, they were about one hundred men, (who seek bounty) who seek reward (and pleasure from Allah) and the good pleasure of Allah by means of jihad (and help Allah and His messenger) through jihad. (They are the loyal) they are the ones who are true in their faith and jihad."
وَٱلَّذِينَ تَبَوَّءُوا ٱلدَّارَ وَٱلإِيمَانَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ يُحِبُّونَ مَنْ هَاجَرَ إِلَيْهِمْ وَلاَ يَجِدُونَ فِي صُدُورِهِمْ حَاجَةً مِّمَّآ أُوتُواْ وَيُؤْثِرُونَ عَلَىٰ أَنفُسِهِمْ وَلَوْ كَانَ بِهِمْ خَصَاصَةٌ وَمَن يُوقَ شُحَّ نَفْسِهِ فَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْمُفْلِحُونَ,"Then the Prophet (pbuh) to the Helpers (al-Ansar): “These spoils and gardens are solely for the poor among the Emigrants. If you wish, I will divide your wealth and properties on the Emigrants and give you a share of the spoils, or you keep your wealth and properties and I divide the spoils on the poor among the Emigrants”. They said: “O Messenger of Allah, we would like to share our wealth and properties with them and we will also prefer them over ourselves and let them have the spoils”. Allah praised them for this by saying: (Those who entered the city) those who made it possible for the Prophet (pbuh) and his Companions to live in the abode of migration (and the faith before them) and were believers before the Immigrants came to them (love these who flee unto them for refuge) in Medina from among the Companions of the Prophet (pbuh) (and find in their breasts) in their hearts (no need) no resentful envy; and it is said this means: no vexation (for that which hath been given them) of spoils, while they did not get any, (but prefer (the fugitives) above themselves) with their wealth and homes (though poverty become their lot. And whoso is saved from his own avarice) and whoever drives away avarice from his own self (such are they who are successful) such are they who are saved from Allah's wrath and chastisement."
وَٱلَّذِينَ جَآءُوا مِن بَعْدِهِمْ يَقُولُونَ رَبَّنَا ٱغْفِرْ لَنَا وَلإِخْوَانِنَا ٱلَّذِينَ سَبَقُونَا بِٱلإِيمَانِ وَلاَ تَجْعَلْ فِي قُلُوبِنَا غِلاًّ لِّلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ رَبَّنَآ إِنَّكَ رَءُوفٌ رَّحِيمٌ,"(And those who came (into the faith) after them) after the first Emigrants (say: Our Lord Forgive us) our sins (and our brethren who were before us in the faith) and migration, (and place not in our hearts any rancour) or resentful envy (towards those who believe) among the Emigrants. (Our Lord! Thou art Full of Pity, Merciful) they made these supplications because they were afraid of resentful envy, because the Prophet (pbuh) gave the spoils to the first Emigrants and did not give them anything."
أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى ٱلَّذِينَ نَافَقُواْ يَقُولُونَ لإِخْوَانِهِمُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِنْ أَهْلِ ٱلْكِتَابِ لَئِنْ أُخْرِجْتُمْ لَنَخْرُجَنَّ مَعَكُمْ وَلاَ نُطِيعُ فيكُمْ أَحَداً أَبَداً وَإِن قُوتِلْتُمْ لَنَنصُرَنَّكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ يَشْهَدُ إِنَّهُمْ لَكَاذِبُونَ,"(Hast thou not observed) O Muhammad (those who are hypocrites) those who are double-faced in their religion: these were a group of people from the Aws tribe who claimed to be believers in the open but were disbelievers in private, ((how) they tell) in private (their brethren who disbelieve among the People of the Scripture) i.e. Banu Qurayzah; they said to them when they were surrounded by the Prophet (pbuh) “Remain firm in your faith inside your strongholds”: (If ye are driven out) from Medina as were driven out the Banu'l-Nadir, (we surely will go out with you, and we will never obey anyone against you) and we will not help anyone in Medina against you, (and if ye are attacked) by the Prophet (pbuh) and his Companions (we verily will help you) against them. (And Allah beareth witness) and Allah knows (that they) i.e. the hypocrites (verily are liars) they lie in what they say."
لَئِنْ أُخْرِجُواْ لاَ يَخْرُجُونَ مَعَهُمْ وَلَئِن قُوتِلُواْ لاَ يَنصُرُونَهُمْ وَلَئِن نَّصَرُوهُمْ لَيُوَلُّنَّ ٱلأَدْبَارَ ثُمَّ لاَ يُنصَرُونَ,"((For) indeed if they) i.e. the Banu Qurayzah (are driven out) from Medina (they) the hypocrites (go not out with them, and indeed if they are attacked) by the Prophet (pbuh) (they help not) against Muhammad (pbuh) (and indeed if they had helped them) against Muhammad (pbuh) (they would have turned and fled) in defeat, (and then they would not have been victorious) they will not escape what will befall them."
لأَنتُمْ أَشَدُّ رَهْبَةً فِي صُدُورِهِمْ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ ذَلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ قَوْمٌ لاَّ يَفْقَهُونَ,Allah then said to the believers: (Ye are more awful as a fear in their bosoms than Allah) He says: the fear of the Jews and hypocrites of the swords of Muhammad (pbuh) and his Companions is greater than their fear of Allah. (That) fear (is because they are a folk who understand not) the command of Allah or Allah's divine Oneness.
لاَ يُقَاتِلُونَكُمْ جَمِيعاً إِلاَّ فِي قُرًى مُّحَصَّنَةٍ أَوْ مِن وَرَآءِ جُدُرٍ بَأْسُهُمْ بَيْنَهُمْ شَدِيدٌ تَحْسَبُهُمْ جَمِيعاً وَقُلُوبُهُمْ شَتَّىٰ ذَلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ قَوْمٌ لاَّ يَعْقِلُونَ,"(They) i.e. Banu Qurayzah and Banu'l-Nadir (will not fight against you in a body save in fortified villages or from behind walls) or if there is between you and them walls. (Their adversity among themselves is very great) He says: their fighting against each other is great, for they fought against their own folk and not against the Prophet (pbuh) and his Companions. (Ye think of them as a whole) united (whereas their hearts are diverse) whereas they differ a great deal. (That) differing and betrayal (is because they are a folk who have no sense) is because they do not understand Allah's command and divine Oneness."
كَمَثَلِ ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ قَرِيباً ذَاقُواْ وَبَالَ أَمْرِهِمْ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,"(On the likeness of those (who suffered) a short time before them) He says: the similitude of Banu Qurayzah with regard to breaking covenants and the punishment inflicted upon them as a result is like that of the Banu'l-Nadir two years before them, (they taste the ill-effects of their conduct) they, i.e. Banu'l-Nadir, taste the punishment of breaking their covenant, (and theirs is painful punishment) in the Hereafter."
كَمَثَلِ ٱلشَّيْطَانِ إِذْ قَالَ لِلإِنسَانِ ٱكْفُرْ فَلَمَّا كَفَرَ قَالَ إِنِّي بَرِيۤءٌ مِّنكَ إِنِّيۤ أَخَافُ ٱللَّهَ رَبَّ ٱلْعَالَمِينَ,"((And the hypocrites) with the Banu Qurayzah upon failing them ((are) on the likeness of the devil) with the monk (when he telleth man) the monk Barsisa (to disbelieve) in Allah, (then, when he disbelieveth) he lets him down and (says: Lo! I am quit of thee) and of your religion. (Lo! I fear Allah, the Lord of the Worlds."

(And let every soul) whether it is righteous or sinful (look to that which it sendeth on before for the morrow) to what it achieved for the Day of Judgement, for it will only find on the Day of Judgement that which it has performed in the life of the world; if it is good, it is good, and if it is evil, it is evil. (And observe your duty to Allah) and fear Allah! (Lo! Allah is informed of what ye do) of good and evil."

(Such are the evil-doers) such are the disbelievers in Allah in private, i.e. the hypocrites; and if it is taken to mean the Jews, this means: such are the disbelievers in Allah openly and in private."

(Lo! Allah loveth the just dealers) the just ones who honour their pledges. The latter are Khuza'ah, the people of Hilal Ibn 'Uwaymir, and Khuzaymah and the Banu Mudlij who signed a treaty with the Prophet (pbuh) before the year of the al-Hudaybiyyah and which stipulated that they will not fight against him, drive him out of Mecca or help anyone to drive him out of Mecca. It is for this reason that Allah did not forbid him from having relations with them."

When believing women) who truly believe in Allah (come unto you as fugitives) from Mecca to Medina or al-Hudaybiyyah, (examine them) ask them and let them swear as to their intentions from their coming. (Allah is best aware of their faith) Allah is best aware of their hearts' firmness in faith. (Then, if ye know them for true believers) through examination, (send them not back unto the disbelievers) do not send them back to their disbelieving husbands. (They are not) i.e. the believing women, (lawful for the disbelievers) for their disbelieving husbands, (nor are the disbelievers lawful for them) for the believing women. Allah says: a believing woman is not lawful for a disbelieving man nor is a disbelieving woman lawful for a believing man. (And give the disbelievers that which they have spent (upon them)) give their husbands that which they have spent on them as dower. This was revealed about Subay'ah Bint al-Harth al-Aslamiyyah who came to the Prophet (pbuh) in the year of al-Hudaybiyyah, to declare her Islam but her husband Musafir came after her to take her back. The Prophet, Allah bless him and give peace, gave him back the dowry which her husband had given her. In that particular year, and before the revelation of this verse, the people of Mecca had signed a treaty with the Prophet (pbuh) which stipulated that whoever from the people of Mecca embraces Islam can join the Muslims, and whoever of the Muslims embraces the religion of the Meccan pagans is returned to the Muslims; and any woman from the people of Mecca who embraces Islam, the Muslims should pay back the dowry given to her to her husband, and any Muslim woman who joins the religion of the Meccan pagans, the people of Mecca should pay back her dowry to her husband. This is why the Prophet (pbuh) paid back to Musafir the dowry which he had given to Subay'ah. (And it is no sin for you) O believers (to marry such women) those who were disbelievers and then embraced Islam (when ye have given them their dues) when you have given them their dowry. Allah says here: any woman who embraces Islam while her husband remains a disbeliever, the sacred bond that ties her to her husband becomes broken and, therefore, she does not have to observe a waiting period and can marry after making sure she is not pregnant."
وَإِن فَاتَكُمْ شَيْءٌ مِّنْ أَزْوَاجِكُمْ إِلَى ٱلْكُفَّارِ فَعَاقَبْتُمْ فَآتُواْ ٱلَّذِينَ ذَهَبَتْ أَزْوَاجُهُمْ مِّثْلَ مَآ أَنفَقُواْ وَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ ٱلَّذِيۤ أَنتُمْ بِهِ مُؤْمِنُونَ,"(And if any of your wives have gone from you unto the disbelievers) with whom you do not have any treaty or pledge (and afterward ye have your turn (of triumph)) and afterward you obtain booty from the enemy, (then give unto those whose wives have gone) to the disbelievers (the like of that which they have spent) of dowry on their wives; this should be given before the fifth of the booty is taken out from it, (and keep your duty to Allah) fear Allah regarding that which He commands you (in whom ye are believers) true believers. There were just six women who left Islam and joined the disbelievers of Mecca, two of them were wives of 'Umar Ibn al-Khattab, Umm Salamah and Umm Kulthum Bint Jarul, and also Umm al-Hakam the daughter of Abu Sufyan who was the wife of 'Abbad Ibn Shaddad al-Fihri, and Fatimah Bint Abi Umayyah Ibn al-Mughirah and Buru' Bint 'Uqbah who was the wife of Shammas Ibn 'Uthman from the Banu Makhzum, and 'Abdah Bint 'Abd al-'Uzza Ibn Nadlah whose husband was 'Amr Ibn Wudd, and Hind Bint Abu Jahl Ibn Hisham whose husband was Hashim Ibn al-'Ass Ibn Wa'il al-Sahmi. The Prophet (pbuh) gave back to the husbands of these women the dowry they had spend on them."

Meaning Muhammad (If believing women) the woman of the people of Mecca (come unto thee) after the conquest of Mecca, (taking oath of allegiance unto thee that they will ascribe nothing as partner unto Allah) among idols nor deem this to be lawful, (and will neither steal) or deem stealing permitted (nor commit adultery) or deem it lawful (nor kill their children) nor bury their daughters alive or deem this to be lawful, (nor produce any lie) nor bring any child conceived from fornication (that they have devised between their hands and feet) and then tell their husbands it is theirs, (nor disobey you in what is right) nor disobey you in all that which you command and forbid them such as shunning wailing, pulling out their hair, tearing apart their clothes, scratching their faces, rending their outer garments, shaving their heads, being alone with strangers or travelling alone a journey of three days or less without the company of an unmarriageable person, (then accept their allegiance) on this (and ask Allah to forgive them) that which they committed in the pre-Islamic era. (Lo! Allah is Forgiving) after the conquest of Mecca, He forgives them what they committed in the pre-Islamic period, (Merciful) in relation to what they do after they have accepted Islam."

سَبَّحَ لِلَّهِ مَا فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَهُوَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ,"And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said regarding the interpretation of Allah's saying (All that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth glorifieth Allah): '(All that is in the heavens) of created beings (and all that is in the earth) of creatures and living beings (glorifieth Allah) prays to Allah; and it is also said this means: remembers Allah, (and He is the Mighty) in retribution against those who disbelieve in Him, (the Wise) in His command and decree, and He has decreed that none should be worshipped beside Him."
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ لِمَ تَقُولُونَ مَا لاَ تَفْعَلُونَ,"(O ye who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an! (why say ye that which ye do not?) why do you speak about that which you do not act upon? This is because they said: “O Messenger of Allah! If we knew the most beloved deed to Allah, we would certainly do it”. But when he informed them about the works which are dear to Him in His saying (O ye who believe! Shall I show you a commerce that will save you from a painful doom?) whose pain extends to the hearts, they waited for as long as Allah willed, but Allah did not explain further. They then said: “if only we knew what it is so that we give for it our wealth, persons and families”. Allah answered by saying (Ye should believe in Allah and His messenger, and should strive for the cause of Allah with your wealth and your lives…), and so Allah explained to them what to do, saying: you should be firm in your belief in Allah and His Messenger and you should also strive to obey Allah using your wealth and own persons. But when they were tried in the Battle of Uhud and ran away from the battlefield, leaving the Prophet (pbuh) behind, Allah reproached them saying: why do you promise that which you cannot fulfil and why talk about that which you cannot perform?"
كَبُرَ مَقْتاً عِندَ ٱللَّهِ أَن تَقُولُواْ مَا لاَ تَفْعَلُونَ,(It is most hateful in the sight of Allah that ye say that which ye do not) that you promise that which you cannot fulfil or speak of doing that which you cannot do.

Why persecute ye me) why do you hurt me with the things you say about me. They used to accuse him of having swollen testicles, and his story has already been explained in Surah of the Clans, (when ye well know that I am Allah's messenger unto you? So when they went astray) when they deviated from the Truth and guidance (Allah sent their hearts astray) from the Truth and guidance; it is also said that this means: when they lied about Moses, Allah turned away their hearts from the declaration of Allah's divine Oneness; and it is also said that this means: when they deviated from the Truth and guidance, Allah increased the deviance of their hearts. (And Allah guideth not) to His religion (the evil-living folk) the disbelievers, those whom Allah knows in His preeternal knowledge that they will not believe."

Yet when he) i.e. Jesus and it is also said: Muhammad (pbuh) (hath come unto them with clear proofs) with commands, prohibitions and the marvels which he displayed to them, (they say: This is mere magic) this is evident magic and lies."
وَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّنِ ٱفْتَرَىٰ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ ٱلْكَذِبَ وَهُوَ يُدْعَىٰ إِلَى ٱلإِسْلاَمِ وَٱللَّهُ لاَ يَهْدِي ٱلْقَوْمَ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ,(And who doth greater wrong) in his state of disbelief (than he who inventeth a lie against Allah) by ascribing to Him sons and partners (when he is summoned unto al-Islam) when he is summoned to believe in Allah's divine Oneness. The reference here is to the Jews whom the Prophet (pbuh) invited to embrace the profession of Allah's divine Oneness. (And Allah guideth not wrong-doing folk) He guides not to His religion those Jews whom He knew in His preeternal knowledge that they will die as Jews.
يُرِيدُونَ لِيُطْفِئُواْ نُورَ ٱللَّهِ بِأَفْوَٰهِهِمْ وَٱللَّهُ مُتِمُّ نُورِهِ وَلَوْ كَرِهَ ٱلْكَٰفِرُونَ,"(Fain would they) i.e. the Jews and Christians (put out the light of Allah) to abort the religion of Allah; and it is said this means: to abort the Book of Allah: the Qur'an, (with their mouths) with their tongues and lies, (but Allah will perfect His light) but Allah will manifest His religion and Book (however much the disbelievers are averse) even though the Jews, Christians and pagan Arabs dislike its happening."

(That) striving (is better for you) wealth, (if ye did but know) if you believe in the reward of Allah."

(That) which I have mentioned (is the Supreme Triumph) the tremendous triumph: they have gained the Garden and were saved from the Fire."

(Be Allah's helpers) be helpers to Muhammad (pbuh) against his enemies; it is also said this means: be Allah's helpers against His enemies, (even as Jesus son of Mary said unto the disciples: Who are my helpers for Allah) who are my helpers, along with Allah, against His enemies? (They said) his disciples said: (We are Allah's helpers) we are your helpers, along with Allah, against His enemies. They were 12 male disciples, the first to believe in him and help him against his enemies. All of these men were believers. (And a party of the Children of Israel believed) in Jesus the son of Mary, (while a party disbelieved) in Jesus son of Mary. This is the party that was led astray by Paul and did not believe in him. (Then We strengthened) We helped and fortified (those who believed) in Jesus the son of Mary and did not oppose his religion (against their foe) those who opposed the religion of Jesus, (and they became the uppermost) in argument against their foes because of their prayer to Allah, and it is also said because they were among those who glorified Allah'."

There is also another way of understanding this: when the Imam finishes the Friday prayer, disperse in the mosque and seek that which is better for you, i.e. the hidden knowledge, Oneness, non-attachment and reliance on Allah, (and remember Allah) with your tongues and hearts (much) in all circumstances, (that ye may be successful) that you may escape Allah's chastisement and wrath."

(Say) to them, O Muhammad: (That which Allah hath) of reward (is better) for you (than pastime) the sound of the drum (and than merchandise) of Dihyah al-Kalbi; He says: if you had stayed with your Prophet and prayed behind him and then made supplications before leaving the mosque, that would have been better for you in terms of reward and bestowal of honour from Allah, and much better than leaving the mosque without doing this, (and Allah is the Best of providers) Allah is the best of those who give; i.e. say this when the hypocrites come to you'."

(And Allah knoweth) and Allah bears witness (that thou art) O Muhammad (indeed His messenger) without the need for the testimony of the hypocrites, (and Allah beareth witness) and Allah knows (that the Hypocrites are speaking falsely) that the hypocrites lie in their oath, because they do not know it nor are their hearts conscious of it."

((They are)) i.e. their bodies are (as though they were blocks of wood in striped cloaks) aligned against the wall; He says: there is no goodness or light in their hearts just as dry wood has no life or moistness in it.

(So they disbelieved) in the Scriptures, messengers and signs (and turned away) from accepting faith in the Scriptures, messengers and signs, (and Allah was independent (of them)) of their faith. (Allah is Absolute) Allah is free of need for their faith, (Owner of Praise) He is praiseworthy in His acts; it is also said that this means: He is the Owner of Praise as far as those who believe in His divine Oneness are concerned."

(And whoso believeth in Allah) and in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Qur'an (and does right) sincerely between himself and his Lord, (He will remit from him his evil deeds) He will forgive his sins because of his belief in Allah's divine Oneness (and will bring him into Gardens beneath which) beneath its trees and habitations (rivers flow) rivers of wine, water, honey and milk flow, (therein to abide for ever) dwelling in Paradise never to die or leave it. (That is the Supreme Triumph) that is the supreme gain: they gained the Garden and are saved from the Fire."

(And Allah is Knower of all things) that befall you, whether it is a calamity or something else."

(And if ye efface) if you pardon them for barring you (and overlook) and turn away from them, and not punish them (and forgive) their sins after they have migrated from Mecca to Medina, (then lo! Allah is Forgiving) He forgives he who repents, (Merciful) towards he who die repentant."

(And whoso is saved from his own greed) whoever drives away from himself his own greed; and it is also said this means: whoever gives the poor-due entitled in his wealth, (such are the successful) who escape Allah's wrath and torment."
إِن تُقْرِضُواْ ٱللَّهَ قَرْضاً حَسَناً يُضَاعِفْهُ لَكُمْ وَيَغْفِرْ لَكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ شَكُورٌ حَلِيمٌ,"(If ye lend unto Allah) by giving alms (a goodly loan) sincerely from your hearts and intending with it no one but Allah, (He will double it for you) He will accept it and multiply it from seven to 70 and up two millions folds, and up to whatever He wills (and will forgive you) through your alms, (for Allah is Responsive) in that He accepts your alms and multiplies it manifold; it is also said that this means: He is thankful: He accepts very little from His salves and rewards for it abundantly, (Clement) He does not hasten His punishment upon those who boast about their almsgiving and those who refuse to give alms,"

And this includes his community. (When ye (men) put away women) He says: tell your people, when you want to divorce women, (put them away for their (legal) period) divorce them when they become pure from their menses and they have not had sexual intercourse with them (and reckon the period) reckon their periods of purity following three periods of menstruation which are followed by major ritual ablution which, for this denotes the end of the waiting period (and keep your duty to Allah) and fear Allah, (your Lord) and do not divorce them when they are not ritually pure, as this goes against the prophetic practice. (Expel them not from their houses) where the divorce has taken place until the waiting period is over (nor let them go forth) until the elapse of the waiting period (unless they commit open immorality) unless they commit an evident sin, i.e. going out during the waiting period without her husbands' permission. Thus, expelling them from their homes during the waiting period is a sin and their going out in their waiting period is also a sin; it is also said that (unless they commit open immorality) means: unless they commit an act of adultery witnessed by four people, in which case they should be stoned. (Such are the limits (imposed by) Allah) these are the legal rulings and obligations of Allah about women regarding expenditure and lodgement; (and whoso transgresseth Allah's limits) and whoever transgresses Allah's legal rulings and obligations and that which He has commanded regarding expenditure and lodgement, (he verily wrongeth his soul) he harms his own person. (Thou knowest not) i.e. the husband does not know: (it may be that Allah will afterward) after the first pronouncement of divorce and before the end of the waiting period (bring some new thing to pass) i.e. love between the husband and wife and return to each other."
فَإِذَا بَلَغْنَ أَجَلَهُنَّ فَأَمْسِكُوهُنَّ بِمَعْرُوفٍ أَوْ فَارِقُوهُنَّ بِمَعْرُوفٍ وَأَشْهِدُواْ ذَوَىْ عَدْلٍ مِّنكُمْ وَأَقِيمُواْ ٱلشَّهَادَةَ لِلَّهِ ذَلِكُمْ يُوعَظُ بِهِ مَن كَانَ يُؤْمِنُ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلآخِرِ وَمَن يَتَّقِ ٱللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مَخْرَجاً,"(Then, when they have reached their term) when the waiting period is over, before having major ritual ablution, after the end of the third period of menstruation, (take them back in kindness) before they have major ritual ablution after the third period of menstruation, and then they should be treated with kindness (or part from them in kindness) do not prolong their waiting period, and give them all their rights, (and call to witness) both for divorcing them and taking them back (two just men among you) two free, upright, Muslim men, (and keep your testimony upright for Allah) and give your testimony before the judges for Allah's sake. (Whoso believeth in Allah and the Last) resurrection after death (is exhorted) believes (to act thus) i.e. regarding the expenditure, lodgement and delivering testimony. It is said that from the beginning of the surah up to here was revealed about the Prophet (pbuh) when he divorced Hafsah, and also about six prophetic Companions, among whom was Ibn 'Umar, who divorced their wives when they were in their periods, and so Allah forbade them from doing so, because it does not comply with the prophetic practice of divorce, and taught them about the latter. (And whosoever keepeth his duty to Allah) upon committing a transgression and remain steadfast, (Allah will appoint a way out for him) from hardship; it is also said that this means: He will appoint a way out for him from transgression to acts of obedience; it is also said this means: from the Fire into Paradise,"
وَيَرْزُقْهُ مِنْ حَيْثُ لاَ يَحْتَسِبُ وَمَن يَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ فَهُوَ حَسْبُهُ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ بَالِغُ أَمْرِهِ قَدْ جَعَلَ ٱللَّهُ لِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدْراً,"(And will provide for him from (a quarter) whence he hath no expectation) this was revealed about 'Awf Ibn Malik al-Ashja'i whose son was captured by the enemy, and who returned later on to his family bringing with him many camels. (And whosoever putteth his trust in Allah) and whoever relies on Allah regarding provision, (He will suffice him. Lo! Allah bringeth His command to pass) His command and decree will come to pass in times of both comfort and hardship; it is also said this means: His command and providence will come to pass. (Allah hath set a measure) an appointed term (for all things) for both comfort and hardship. When Allah explained the waiting period of women who are divorced, Mu'adh stood up and said: “O Messenger of Allah! What is the waiting period for those women who despair of menstruation?”"
وَٱللاَّئِي يَئِسْنَ مِنَ ٱلْمَحِيضِ مِن نِّسَآئِكُمْ إِنِ ٱرْتَبْتُمْ فَعِدَّتُهُنَّ ثَلاَثَةُ أَشْهُرٍ وَٱللاَّئِي لَمْ يَحِضْنَ وَأُوْلاَتُ ٱلأَحْمَالِ أَجَلُهُنَّ أَن يَضَعْنَ حَمْلَهُنَّ وَمَن يَتَّقِ ٱللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مِنْ أَمْرِهِ يُسْراً,"(And for such of your women as despair of menstruation) because of old age, (if ye doubt) about their waiting period, (their period (of waiting) shall be three months) upon which another man asked: “O Messenger of Allah! What about the waiting period of those who do not have menstruation because they are too young?” (along with those who have it not) because of young age, their waiting period is three months. Another man asked: “what is the waiting period for those women who are pregnant?” (And for those with child) i.e. those who are pregnant, (their period) their waiting period (shall be till they bring forth their burden) their child. (And whosoever keepeth his duty to Allah) and whoever fears Allah regarding what he commands him, (He maketh his course easy for him) He makes his matter easy; and it is also said this means: He will help him to worship Him well."
ذَلِكَ أَمْرُ ٱللَّهِ أَنزَلَهُ إِلَيْكُمْ وَمَن يَتَّقِ ٱللَّهَ يُكَفِّرْ عَنْهُ سَيِّئَاتِهِ وَيُعْظِمْ لَهُ أَجْراً,"(That is the commandment of Allah) these are the legal rulings and obligations of Allah (which He revealeth unto you) which He explains to you in the Qur'an. (And whoso keepeth his duty to Allah) and whoever fears Allah regarding what He commands him, (He will remit from him his evil deeds) He will forgive his sins (and magnify reward for him) in the Garden."
أَسْكِنُوهُنَّ مِنْ حَيْثُ سَكَنتُم مِّن وُجْدِكُمْ وَلاَ تُضَآرُّوهُنَّ لِتُضَيِّقُواْ عَلَيْهِنَّ وَإِن كُنَّ أُوْلاَتِ حَمْلٍ فَأَنفِقُواْ عَلَيْهِنَّ حَتَّىٰ يَضَعْنَ حَمْلَهُنَّ فَإِنْ أَرْضَعْنَ لَكُمْ فَآتُوهُنَّ أُجُورَهُنَّ وَأْتَمِرُواْ بَيْنَكُمْ بِمَعْرُوفٍ وَإِن تَعَاسَرْتُمْ فَسَتُرْضِعُ لَهُ أُخْرَىٰ,"Allah then went back to the subject of divorcees and said: (Lodge them) lodge the women you divorce (where ye dwell) wherever you live, (according to your wealth) you provide expenditure and lodgement, (and harass them not) do not harass the women you divorce regarding expenditure and lodgement (so as to straiten life for them) and thus wrong them. (And if they are with child) and if the women you divorce are pregnant, (then spend for them) i.e. the husbands should spend for them (till they bring forth their burden) until they give birth to their child. (Then, if they give suck for you) if the mother breastfeeds a child of yours, (give them) i.e. the mothers (their due payment) for breastfeeding (and consult together in kindness) the husband should spend on the mother without stinginess or spendthriftness; (but if ye make difficulties for one another) i.e. regarding expenditure and the mother refuses to breastfeed the child, (then let some other woman give suck for him (the father of the child)) then another woman, other than the mother, should be sought to breastfeed the child."
لِيُنفِقْ ذُو سَعَةٍ مِّن سَعَتِهِ وَمَن قُدِرَ عَلَيْهِ رِزْقُهُ فَلْيُنفِقْ مِمَّآ آتَاهُ ٱللَّهُ لاَ يُكَلِّفُ ٱللَّهُ نَفْساً إِلاَّ مَآ آتَاهَا سَيَجْعَلُ ٱللَّهُ بَعْدَ عُسْرٍ يُسْراً,"(Let him) i.e. the father, (who hath abundance) who is well off (spend of his abundance) according to his wealth, (and he whose provision is measured) and he whose livelihood is tight, (let him spend) on breastfeeding (of that which Allah hath given him) according to what Allah has given him. (Allah asketh naught of any soul) regarding payment for breastfeeding (save that which He hath given it) save according to what he has given it of wealth. (Allah will vouchsafe, after hardship) in expenditure, (ease) after poverty there will be richness, for the one who suffers hardship of living awaits provision from Allah."
وَكَأِيِّن مِّن قَرْيَةٍ عَتَتْ عَنْ أَمْرِ رَبِّهَا وَرُسُلِهِ فَحَاسَبْنَاهَا حِسَاباً شَدِيداً وَعَذَّبْنَاهَا عَذَاباً نُّكْراً,"(And how many a community) how many people of a community (revolted against the ordinance of its Lord) transgressed and refused to obey the commands of their Lord (and His messenger) and rejected the messengers and the messages they brought to them, (and we called it to a stern account) in the Hereafter (and punished it) in the life of the world (with dire punishment) with severe punishment,"
فَذَاقَتْ وَبَالَ أَمْرِهَا وَكَانَ عَاقِبَةُ أَمْرِهَا خُسْراً,"(So that it tasted the ill effects of its conduct) it tasted the punishment of its course in the life of the world through being destroyed, (and the consequence of its conduct) in the Hereafter (was loss) will be loss."

(And Allah is Forgiving) He forgives you, (Merciful) about that oath."

(And when he told it her) when the Prophet (pbuh) informed Hafsah about what she said to 'A'ishah (she said) Hafsah said: (Who hath told thee) that I informed 'A'ishah? (He said) the Prophet (pbuh) said: (The Knower, the Aware hath told me) what you divulged to 'A'ishah."

This means feeling regret in one's heart, asking forgiveness with one's tongue and stop engaging in the particular sin one is repenting of with one's body and conscience, intending never to return to it (It may be) “may be” from Allah denotes a necessity (that your Lord will remit from you your evil deeds) forgive your sins through repentance (and bring you) in the Hereafter (into Gardens beneath which) beneath their trees and habitations (rivers flow) rivers of wine, water, honey and milk flow, (on the day) which is the Day of Judgement (when Allah will not abase the Prophet) as He abases the disbelievers; He says: He will not torment the Prophet (pbuh) (and those who believe with him) and will not torment those who believe in him, such as Abu Bakr and his believing brothers. (Their light will run) will shine (before them) on the Bridge over the Fire (and on their right hands: they will say) when the light of the hypocrites is put out: (Our Lord!

Build for me a home with Thee in the Garden) so that Pharaoh's torture becomes bearable for me, (and deliver me from Pharaoh) from the religion of Pharaoh (and his work) and his torture, (and deliver me from evil doing folk) the disbelievers. Thus the disbelief of her husband did not harm her because of her faith and sincerity;"

(And she put faith in the words of her Lord) she believed in what Gabriel told her that he was the Messenger of Allah entrusted with giving her a holy son (and His Scriptures) and she also believed in His Scriptures: the Torah, the Gospel and all other Scriptures; it is also said this means: she believed in the words of her Lord that Jesus the son of Mary will come into being by Allah saying “Be!” and he became a human being, and she also believed in His Scripture: the Gospel, (and was of the obedient) in times of hardship and comfort; and it is also said that this means: and she was obedient to He Who is far transcendent and majestic'."

It is used as a means of travel by the prophets; (and death) resembling a ram whose wool is a mixture of white and black. This ram does not pass by, step on, or is smelled by, any thing except that that thing dies. It is also said that (He created death) means: He created the sperm drop; and (created life) means: He created the living being; (that He may try you) between life and death, (which of you is best in conduct) which of you is more sincere in works; (and He is the Mighty) in retribution against those who disbelieve in Him, (Forgiving) He forgives those who repent and believe in Him,"

نۤ وَٱلْقَلَمِ وَمَا يَسْطُرُونَ,"And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said regarding the interpretation of Allah's saying (Nun): '(Nun) He says: Allah swears by the Nun, which is the whale that carries the earths on its back while in Water, and beneath which is the Bull and under the Bull is the Rock and under the Rock is the Dust and none knows what is under the Dust save Allah. The name of the whale is Liwash, and it is said its name is Lutiaya'; the name of the bull is Bahamut, and some say its name is Talhut or Liyona. The whale is in a sea called 'Adwad, and it is like a small bull in a huge sea. The sea is in a hollowed rock whereby there is 4,000 cracks, and from each crack water springs out to the earth. It is also said that Nun is one of the names of the Lord; it stands for the letter Nun in Allah's name al-Rahman (the Beneficent); and it is also said that a Nun is an inkwell. (By the pen) Allah swore by the pen. This pen is made of light and its height is equal to the distance between Heaven and earth. It is with this pen that the Wise Remembrance, i.e. the Guarded Tablet, was written. It is also said that the pen is one of the angels by whom Allah has sworn, (and that which they write (therewith)) and Allah also swore by what the angels write down of the works of the children of Adam,"
مَآ أَنتَ بِنِعْمَةِ رَبِّكَ بِمَجْنُونٍ,"(Thou art not) O Muhammad, (for your Lord's favour) for the prophethood and Islam bestowed (unto thee, a madman) bewitched. This is the reason why Allah made the above oath."

فَسَتُبْصِرُ وَيُبْصِرُونَ,(And thou wilt see and they will see) you will see and know and they will see and know upon the descent of chastisement on them
بِأَييِّكُمُ ٱلْمَفْتُونُ,(Which of you is the demented) which of you is mad.
إِنَّ رَبَّكَ هُوَ أَعْلَمُ بِمَن ضَلَّ عَن سَبِيلِهِ وَهُوَ أَعْلَمُ بِٱلْمُهْتَدِينَ,"(Lo! thy Lord) O Muhammad (is best aware of him who strayeth from His way) from His religion, i.e. Abu Jahl and his host, (and He is best aware of those who walk aright) and He is best aware of those who are guided to His religion, i.e. Abu Bakr and his fellow believers."

إِنَّا بَلَوْنَاهُمْ كَمَا بَلَوْنَآ أَصْحَابَ ٱلْجَنَّةِ إِذْ أَقْسَمُواْ لَيَصْرِمُنَّهَا مُصْبِحِينَ,"(Lo! we have tried them) We have tried the people of Mecca with death, captivity and defeat on the Day of Badr because they refrained from asking forgiveness and We tried them with hunger and drought for a period of seven years because the Prophet, Allah bless him and give peace, prayed against them on the Day of Badr (as We tried) with hunger and the burning of the gardens (the owners of the garden) the owners of the fields: the Banu Darwan (when they vowed) when they swore by Allah (they would pluck its fruit next morning) at the break of dawn."
وَلاَ يَسْتَثْنُونَ,(And made no exception (for the will of Allah)) they forgot to say: Allah willing;
فَطَافَ عَلَيْهَا طَآئِفٌ مِّن رَّبِّكَ وَهُمْ نَآئِمُونَ,(Then a visitation) a punishment from your Lord (came upon it) upon the garden (while they slept) and was burned.
فَأَصْبَحَتْ كَٱلصَّرِيمِ,(And in the morning it was as if plucked) it was like a dark night.
فَتَنَادَوْاْ مُصْبِحِينَ,"(And they cried out one unto another in the morning) at the break of dawn,"
أَنِ ٱغْدُواْ عَلَىٰ حَرْثِكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ صَارِمِينَ,(Saying: Run unto your field if ye would pluck (the fruit)) before the needy ones come to know about it.
فَٱنطَلَقُواْ وَهُمْ يَتَخَافَتُونَ,"(So they went off) towards the fields, (saying one unto another in low tones:"
أَن لاَّ يَدْخُلَنَّهَا ٱلْيَوْمَ عَلَيْكُمْ مِّسْكِينٌ,No needy man shall enter it) i.e. the garden (today against you.
وَغَدَوْاْ عَلَىٰ حَرْدٍ قَادِرِينَ,"They went betimes) they went to their fields holding rancour, (strong in (this) purpose) to pluck their fruits."
فَلَمَّا رَأَوْهَا قَالُوۤاْ إِنَّا لَضَآلُّونَ,"(But when they saw it) when they saw the fields burned down, (they said: Lo! we are in error!) we have taken a wrong turn; thinking that they were not their fields"
بَلْ نَحْنُ مَحْرُومُونَ,"Then they said: (Nay, but we are desolate!) We have been denied the benefit of the garden because of our ill intentions."

He said this when they made their vow.
قَالُواْ سُبْحَانَ رَبِّنَآ إِنَّا كُنَّا ظَالِمِينَ,(They said: Glorified be our Lord!) We ask forgiveness of our Lord. (Lo! we have been wrong-doers) we harmed ourselves by our transgression and intention to deprive the needy ones and also by failing to say “Allah willing”.
فَأَقْبَلَ بَعْضُهُمْ عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ يَتَلاَوَمُونَ,"(Then some of them drew near unto others, self-reproaching) reproaching one another."
قَالُواْ يٰوَيْلَنَا إِنَّا كُنَّا طَاغِينَ,(They said) in unison: (Alas for us! In truth we were outrageous) we were sinful by depriving the needy ones.
عَسَىٰ رَبُّنَآ أَن يُبْدِلَنَا خَيْراً مِّنْهَآ إِنَّآ إِلَىٰ رَبِّنَا رَاغِبُونَ,(It may be) and “may be” when used in connection with Allah denotes necessity (that our Lord will give us) in the Hereafter in exchange (better than this in place thereof) better than this garden. (Lo! we beseech our Lord) our desire is with Allah.
كَذَلِكَ ٱلْعَذَابُ وَلَعَذَابُ ٱلآخِرَةِ أَكْبَرُ لَوْ كَانُواْ يَعْلَمُونَ,"(Such was the punishment) in the life of the world for the one who refrains from giving Allah's due from his wealth, just as Allah burnt their garden and exposed them to hunger; it is also said that this means: such is the punishment of the life of the world as happened to the people of Mecca who were exposed to hunger and death. (And verily the punishment of the Hereafter) for he who does not repent (is greater) than the punishment of the life of the world (if they did but know) if the people of Mecca did but knew, but they do not know nor do they believe in this."
إِنَّ لِّلْمُتَّقِينَ عِنْدَ رَبِّهِمْ جَنَّاتِ ٱلنَّعِيمِ,"(Lo! for those who keep from evil) for those who ward off disbelief, idolatry and indecencies (are Gardens of Bliss) whose bliss is continuous and eternal (with their Lord) in the Hereafter."
أَفَنَجْعَلُ ٱلْمُسْلِمِينَ كَٱلْمُجْرِمِينَ,"'Utbah Ibn Rabi'ah said: “if what Muhammad (pbuh) says to his Companions about Paradise and its bliss is true, we will surely be better than them in the Hereafter as we are better than them in the life of this world”, and so Allah revealed: (Shall We then treat those who have surrendered) shall We then make the reward of the Muslims in Paradise (as We treat the guilty) as the reward of the idolaters who are the owners of the Fire?"
مَا لَكُمْ كَيْفَ تَحْكُمُونَ,(What aileth you) O people of Mecca? (How foolishly ye judge!) Evil is what you judge for yourselves!
أَمْ لَكُمْ كِتَابٌ فِيهِ تَدْرُسُونَ,(Or have ye a Scripture wherein you learn) wherein you recite
إِنَّ لَكُمْ فِيهِ لَمَا تَخَيَّرُونَ,(That you shall indeed have) in this Scripture (all that ye choose) all you desire in Paradise in the Hereafter?
أَمْ لَكُمْ أَيْمَانٌ عَلَيْنَا بَالِغَةٌ إِلَىٰ يَوْمِ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ إِنَّ لَكُمْ لَمَا تَحْكُمُونَ,"(Or have ye a covenant) pledges (on oath from Us) on firm oaths from Us (that reacheth to the Day of Judgement, that yours shall be all that ye ordain) that you shall have all that you judge for yourselves in Paradise in the Hereafter?"
سَلْهُمْ أَيُّهُم بِذَلِكَ زَعِيمٌ,(Ask them) O Muhammad (which of them will vouch for that) that they say!
أَمْ لَهُمْ شُرَكَآءُ فَلْيَأتُواْ بِشُرَكَآئِهِمْ إِن كَانُواْ صَادِقِينَ,(Or have they other gods? Then let them bring their other gods if they are truthful) that they will have that which they claim.
يَوْمَ يُكْشَفُ عَن سَاقٍ وَيُدْعَوْنَ إِلَى ٱلسُّجُودِ فَلاَ يَسْتَطِيعُونَ,"(On the day when it befalleth in earnest) a matter to which they were blind in the life of the world; it is also said this means: when a severe, horrific matter is revealed; and it is also said that this means: when a sign between them and their Lord is revealed, (and they are ordered to prostrate themselves) this is because they said: By Allah, our Lord, we were not idolaters or hypocrites (but are not able) to prostrate, their bodies remaining erect like solid fortresses,"
خَٰشِعَةً أَبْصَٰرُهُمْ تَرْهَقُهُمْ ذِلَّةٌ وَقَدْ كَانُواْ يُدْعَوْنَ إِلَى ٱلسُّجُودِ وَهُمْ سَٰلِمُونَ,"(With eyes downcast) not able to see any good, (abasement stupefying them) humiliation and darkness appear on their faces. (And they had been summoned) in the life of the world (to prostrate themselves) to submit themselves through the profession of Allah's divine Oneness but did not submit to Allah's divine Oneness (while they were yet unhurt) while they were strong and sound of bodies."
فَذَرْنِي وَمَن يُكَذِّبُ بِهَـٰذَا ٱلْحَدِيثِ سَنَسْتَدْرِجُهُمْ مِّنْ حَيْثُ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ,(Leave Me) O Muhammad ((to deal) with those who give the lie to this pronouncement) to this Scripture. (We shall lead them on) i.e. those who mock the Qur'an (by steps from whence they know not) from whence they perceive not. And Allah did indeed destroy them-they were five people-in one night and one day.
وَأُمْلِي لَهُمْ إِنَّ كَيْدِي مَتِينٌ,"(Yet I bear with them) I give them a reprieve, (for lo! My scheme is firm) My punishment is severe."
أَمْ تَسْأَلُهُمْ أَجْراً فَهُمْ مِّن مَّغْرَمٍ مُّثْقَلُونَ,(Or dost thou (Muhammad) ask a fee) or provision in exchange for faith (from them) from the people of Mecca (so that they are heavily taxed) they are too much indebted by accepting your invitation to accept faith?
أَمْ عِندَهُمُ ٱلْغَيْبُ فَهُمْ يَكْتُبُونَ,(Or is the Unseen) the Guarded Tablet (theirs that they can write (thereof)) that with which they argue against you?
فَٱصْبِرْ لِحُكْمِ رَبِّكَ وَلاَ تَكُن كَصَاحِبِ ٱلْحُوتِ إِذْ نَادَىٰ وَهُوَ مَكْظُومٌ,"(But wait thou for your Lord's decree) be patient in conveying the message of your Lord; it is also said this means: be pleased with the decree of your Lord, (and be not) fed up and heart constricted with regard to Allah's command (like him of the fish) like Jonah the son of Mathew (Matta), (who cried out) to his Lord in the belly of the fish (in despair) tired and aggrieved."
لَّوْلاَ أَن تَدَارَكَهُ نِعْمَةٌ مِّن رَّبِّهِ لَنُبِذَ بِٱلْعَرَآءِ وَهُوَ مَذْمُومٌ,(Had it not been that favour) mercy (from his Lord had reached him he surely had been cast into the wilderness while he was reprobate) and guilty.
فَٱجْتَبَاهُ رَبُّهُ فَجَعَلَهُ مِنَ ٱلصَّالِحِينَ,(But his Lord chose him) to make repentance (and placed him among the righteous) among the messengers.
وَإِن يَكَادُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لَيُزْلِقُونَكَ بِأَبْصَارِهِمْ لَمَّا سَمِعُواْ ٱلذِّكْرَ وَيَقُولُونَ إِنَّهُ لَمَجْنُونٌ,"(And lo! those who disbelieve) the disbelievers of Mecca (would fain disconcert thee) would kill you (with their eyes) and it is said this means: they would give you the evil eye (when they hear the Reminder) when they hear you recite the Qur'an, (and they) i.e. the people of Mecca (say: Lo! he is) i.e. Muhammad (indeed mad) bewitched;"
وَمَا هُوَ إِلاَّ ذِكْرٌ لِّلْعَالَمِينَ,(When it is) i.e. the Qur'an (naught else than a Reminder to creation) to the jinn and humankind'.
ٱلْحَاقَّةُ,And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said regarding the interpretation of Allah's saying (The Reality. What is the Reality): '(The Reality
مَا ٱلْحَآقَّةُ,What is the Reality) He says: the Hour. What is the Hour? He said this in amazement.
وَمَآ أَدْرَاكَ مَا ٱلْحَاقَّةُ,"(Ah, what will convey unto thee) O Muhammad (what the reality is!) it is called the Reality because of the reality of things which will entitle the believer to enter the Garden due to his faith and the disbeliever to enter the Fire because of his disbelief."
كَذَّبَتْ ثَمُودُ وَعَادٌ بِٱلْقَارِعَةِ,((The tribes of) Thamud) the people of Salih (and 'Aad) the people of Hud (disbelieved in the judgement to come) in the coming of the Hour.

It) i.e. the Qur'an (is Absolute Truth) it is truly and certainly My speech which Gabriel took down to an illustrious messenger; it is also said that this means: and that which I have mentioned of the disbelievers' anguish and remorse is true and certain; such anguish and remorse on the Day of Judgement will surely take place.

إِنَّآ أَرْسَلْنَا نُوحاً إِلَىٰ قَوْمِهِ أَنْ أَنذِرْ قَوْمَكَ مِن قَبْلِ أَن يَأْتِيَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said regarding the interpretation of Allah's saying (Lo! We sent): '(Lo! We sent Noah unto his people (saying): Warn your people) from Allah's wrath and punishment (ere the painful doom come unto them) in the form of drowning.
قَالَ يٰقَوْمِ إِنِّي لَكُمْ نَذِيرٌ مُّبِينٌ,"(He said: O my people! Lo! I am a plain warner unto you) I am a warning messenger unto you, addressing you in a language you understand."

Whenever I call unto them) to repentance and belief in Allah's divine Oneness (that Thou mayst pardon them) through their repentance and faith in Allah's divine Oneness (they thrust their fingers in their ears) so as not to hear my words and invitation (and cover themselves with their garments) and cover their heads with their garments so that they do not hear my voice or see me (and persist (in their refusal)) and they remain firm in their disbelief and worship of idols; it is also said that they all shouted in unison: “O Noah! We will not believe in you”, (and magnify themselves in pride) and feel too proud to accept faith or repent, because of their arrogance."
ثُمَّ إِنِّي دَعَوْتُهُمْ جِهَاراً,"(And lo! I have called unto them) to repent and believe in Allah's divine Oneness (aloud) openly, thus avoiding secrecy,"

يُرْسِلِ ٱلسَّمَآءَ عَلَيْكُمْ مِّدْرَاراً,"(He will let loose the sky for you in plenteous rain) whenever you need rain. This is because Allah had withheld rain from them for 40 years,"

This is because Allah had, before this, destroyed their fields and made their rivers dry for 40 years."
مَّا لَكُمْ لاَ تَرْجُونَ لِلَّهِ وَقَاراً,"(What aileth you that ye hope not towards Allah for dignity) what ails you that you do not fear Allah's might and majesty; and it is also said that this means: what ails you that you do not magnify Allah as He deserves to be magnified and, thus, believe in His divine Oneness."

لِّتَسْلُكُواْ مِنْهَا سُبُلاً فِجَاجاً,(That ye may thread the valley ways thereof) that you may follow wide ways thereof.
قَالَ نُوحٌ رَّبِّ إِنَّهُمْ عَصَوْنِي وَٱتَّبَعُواْ مَن لَّمْ يَزِدْهُ مَالُهُ وَوَلَدُهُ إِلاَّ خَسَاراً,(Noah said: My Lord!) O my Lord! (They have disobeyed me) regarding repentance and faith in Allah's divine Oneness (and followed) and obeyed (one whose) abundant (wealth and children increase him in naught save ruin) in the Hereafter; this refers to the chieftains of his folk;
وَمَكَرُواْ مَكْراً كُبَّاراً,"(And they have plotted a mighty plot) and they have uttered a tremendous lie,"
وَقَالُواْ لاَ تَذَرُنَّ آلِهَتَكُمْ وَلاَ تَذَرُنَّ وَدّاً وَلاَ سُوَاعاً وَلاَ يَغُوثَ وَيَعُوقَ وَنَسْراً,"(And they have said) i.e. the chieftains said to the communality of the people: (Forsake not your gods) forsake not the worship of your Lord. (Forsake not Wadd) forsake not the worship of Wadd, (nor Suwa') nor the worship of Suwa', (nor Yaghuth and Ya'uq and Nasr) nor the worship of Yaghuth and Ya'uq and Nasr. These were idols which Noah's folk worshipped."
وَقَدْ أَضَلُّواْ كَثِيراً وَلاَ تَزِدِ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ إِلاَّ ضَلاَلاً,"(And they have led many astray) he says: they have misled through them many people; and it is also said: many people went astray because of them, (and Thou increasest the wrong-doers) the disbelievers and idolaters in their worship of these idols (in naught save error) loss and destruction."
مِّمَّا خَطِيۤئَاتِهِمْ أُغْرِقُواْ فَأُدْخِلُواْ نَاراً فَلَمْ يَجِدُواْ لَهُمْ مِّن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ أَنصَاراً,"(Because of their sins they were drowned) by the flood in the life of the world, (then made to enter) in the Hereafter (a Fire. And they found they had no helpers in place of Allah) they had no helpers to defend them against Allah's chastisement."
وَقَالَ نُوحٌ رَّبِّ لاَ تَذَرْ عَلَى ٱلأَرْضِ مِنَ ٱلْكَافِرِينَ دَيَّاراً,"(And Noah said) after Allah told him that none of his people will believe in him, apart from those who had already believed: (My Lord!) O my Lord! (Leave not one of the disbelievers in the land."
إِنَّكَ إِن تَذَرْهُمْ يُضِلُّواْ عِبَادَكَ وَلاَ يَلِدُوۤاْ إِلاَّ فَاجِراً كَفَّاراً,"If Thou shouldst leave them, they will mislead Thy slaves) they will mislead from Your religion those who believe in You and those who wish to believe in You, (and will beget none save lewd ingrates) and will not beget save offspring who are sinful and disbelievers when they reach the age of reason; and it is also said this means: save those upon whom You have decreed disbelief and lewdness when they reach the age of reason; and it is also said that they did not have among them any children because Allah stopped their women from conceiving, and thus they had only adults amongst them, and the latter were all lewd disbelievers."
رَّبِّ ٱغْفِرْ لِي وَلِوَالِدَيَّ وَلِمَن دَخَلَ بَيْتِيَ مُؤْمِناً وَلِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَٱلْمُؤْمِنَاتِ وَلاَ تَزِدِ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ إِلاَّ تَبَاراً,"(My Lord!) O my Lord!

قُلْ أُوحِيَ إِلَيَّ أَنَّهُ ٱسْتَمَعَ نَفَرٌ مِّنَ ٱلْجِنِّ فَقَالُوۤاْ إِنَّا سَمِعْنَا قُرْآناً عَجَباً,"And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said regarding the interpretation of Allah's saying (Say (O Muhammad): It is revealed unto me): '(Say (O Muhammad): It is revealed unto me) say, O Muhammad, to the disbelievers of Mecca that Gabriel has come down and informed me (that a company of the jinn) nine of the jinn of Nusaybin which is near Yemen (gave ear, and they said) after accepting faith and returning to their folk: O our folk! (Lo! it is a marvellous Qur'an) we have listened to the recitation of a marvellous, illustrious and noble Qur'an which resembles the Scripture of Moses, this is because they were followers of the Torah,"
يَهْدِيۤ إِلَى ٱلرُّشْدِ فَآمَنَّا بِهِ وَلَن نُّشرِكَ بِرَبِّنَآ أَحَداً,"(Which guideth unto righteousness) which guides to the Truth, guidance and right course, i.e. to “there is no deity except Allah”, (so we believe in it) we believe in Muhammad (pbuh) and we believe in the Qur'an (and we ascribe unto our Lord no partner) here meaning the devil."
وَأَنَّهُ تَعَالَىٰ جَدُّ رَبِّنَا مَا ٱتَّخَذَ صَاحِبَةً وَلاَ وَلَداً,"(And (we believe) that He-exalted be the glory of our Lord-) and that the dominion of our Lord is exalted; it is also said this means: the tremendousness, sovereignty, absoluteness and attributes of our Lord are far exalted, and He (hath taken neither wife nor son) as the disbelievers claim,"
وَأَنَّهُ كَانَ يَقُولُ سَفِيهُنَا عَلَى ٱللَّهِ شَطَطاً,(And that the foolish one among us) i.e. the devil (used to speak concerning Allah an atrocious lie.
وَأَنَّا ظَنَنَّآ أَن لَّن تَقُولَ ٱلإِنسُ وَٱلْجِنُّ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ كَذِباً,"And lo! we had supposed that humankind and jinn would not speak a lie concerning Allah) and we thought that what humans and the jinn said about Allah was not a lie, but we know now that it is. From the beginning of the surah up to here, Allah related what the jinn said."
وَأَنَّهُ كَانَ رِجَالٌ مِّنَ ٱلإِنسِ يَعُوذُونَ بِرِجَالٍ مِّنَ ٱلْجِنِّ فَزَادُوهُمْ رَهَقاً,"Allah then said: (And indeed (O Muhammad) individuals of humankind used to invoke the protection of individuals of the jinn so that they increased them) because of that (in revolt (against Allah)) in pride, arrogance, sedition, and corruption. This is because they were afraid of them whenever they travelled, caught a game or camped in a valley. And to avoid their harm they used to say: “we seek refuge in the master of this valley from the foolish ones of his folk” after which they felt safe. As a result, the masters of these places increased in nothing but pride and arrogance towards the communality among their folk. There are three kinds of jinn: one kind flies in the air; another kind ascends and descends wherever they wish; and a third kind resembles dogs and snakes;"
وَأَنَّهُمْ ظَنُّواْ كَمَا ظَنَنتُمْ أَن لَّن يَبْعَثَ ٱللَّهُ أَحَداً,"(And indeed they) the disbelievers of the jinn before they accepted faith (supposed, even as you suppose) O people of Mecca, (that Allah would not raise anyone (from the dead)) and it is also said that this means: and they supposed just as you did that Allah will not send anyone as a messenger."
وَأَنَّا لَمَسْنَا ٱلسَّمَآءَ فَوَجَدْنَاهَا مُلِئَتْ حَرَساً شَدِيداً وَشُهُباً,"Allah then went back to the talk of the jinn, saying: (And (the jinn who had listened to the Qur'an said): We had sought the heaven) before we accepted faith (but had found it filled with strong warders) angels (and meteors) preventing them from listening."
وَأَنَّا كُنَّا نَقْعُدُ مِنْهَا مَقَاعِدَ لِلسَّمْعِ فَمَن يَسْتَمِعِ ٱلآنَ يَجِدْ لَهُ شِهَاباً رَّصَداً,(And we used to sit on places (high) therein) in heaven (to listen) before the advent of Muhammad (pbuh). (But he who listened now) after the advent of Muhammad (pbuh) (findeth a flame) a shining star (in wait for him) from the angels in order to prevent them from listening;
وَأَنَّا لاَ نَدْرِيۤ أَشَرٌّ أُرِيدَ بِمَن فِي ٱلأَرْضِ أَمْ أَرَادَ بِهِمْ رَبُّهُمْ رَشَداً,"(And we know not whether) in preventing us from listening (harm is boded unto all who are in the earth, or whether their Lord intendeth guidance for them) or whether their Lord intends guidance, goodness and the correct course for them; it is also said that this means: we do not know whether evil is intended for the people of the earth by the advent of Muhammad (pbuh) such that if they do not believe in him they will be destroyed or it is good, guidance and the correct course that their Lord intends for them if they believe in him."
وَأَنَّا مِنَّا ٱلصَّالِحُونَ وَمِنَّا دُونَ ذَلِكَ كُنَّا طَرَآئِقَ قِدَداً,"(And among us there are righteous folk) those who believe in Allah's divine Oneness; these are those who believe in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an (and among us there are far from that) and among us there are disbelievers, the disbelieving jinn. (We are sects having different rules) we followed different religions, i.e. Judaism and Christianity, before believing in Allah."
وَأَنَّا ظَنَنَّآ أَن لَّن نُّعْجِزَ ٱللَّهَ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَلَن نُّعْجِزَهُ هَرَباً,"(And we know) and are certain (that we cannot escape from Allah in the earth) for He can reach us wherever we might be, (nor can we escape by flight) nor can we escape from Him by running away."
وَأَنَّا لَمَّا سَمِعْنَا ٱلْهُدَىٰ آمَنَّا بِهِ فَمَن يُؤْمِن بِرَبِّهِ فَلاَ يَخَافُ بَخْساً وَلاَ رَهَقاً,"(And when we heard the guidance) and when we heard the recitation of the Qur'an by Muhammad (pbuh) (we believed therein) we believed in the Qur'an and Muhammad (pbuh) (and whoso believeth in his Lord, he feareth neither loss) of all his works (nor oppression) nor decrease of his works."
وَأَنَّا مِنَّا ٱلْمُسْلِمُونَ وَمِنَّا ٱلْقَاسِطُونَ فَمَنْ أَسْلَمَ فَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ تَحَرَّوْاْ رَشَداً,"(And there are among us some who have surrendered (to Allah)) and there are among us those who are sincere in their belief in Allah's divine Oneness; these are the ones who believed in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an (and there are among us some who are unjust) i.e. disobedient ones who have deviated from the Truth and guidance; and these are the disbelievers among the jinn. (And whoso hath surrendered to Allah) and whoever is sincere in his belief in Allah's divine Oneness, (such have taken the right path purposefully) such have intended goodness and the correct course."
وَأَمَّا ٱلْقَاسِطُونَ فَكَانُواْ لِجَهَنَّمَ حَطَباً,"(And as for those who are unjust) i.e. the disbelievers, (they are firewood for hell."

وَأَنَّهُ لَمَّا قَامَ عَبْدُ ٱللَّهِ يَدْعُوهُ كَادُواْ يَكُونُونَ عَلَيْهِ لِبَداً,"(And when the slave of Allah) Muhammad (pbuh) (stood up) in Batn Nakhl (in prayer to Him) to worship Allah through prayer, (they crowded on him, almost stifling) the jinn almost fell on him because of their love of the Qur'an and Muhammad (pbuh) when they heard him recite the Qur'an in Batn Nakhl."
قُلْ إِنَّمَآ أَدْعُواْ رَبِّي وَلاَ أُشْرِكُ بِهِ أَحَداً,"(Say (unto them, O Muhammad): I pray unto Allah only) I worship Allah only and call people to worship none but Him, (and ascribe unto Him no partner."

إِلاَّ بَلاَغاً مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَرِسَالاَتِهِ وَمَن يَعْصِ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ فَإِنَّ لَهُ نَارَ جَهَنَّمَ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَآ أَبَداً,"((Mine is) but conveyance (of the Truth) from Allah) he says: nothing can save me except conveyance on behalf of Allah, (and His messages; and whoso disobeyeth Allah) regarding Allah's divine Oneness (and His messenger) in his conveyance of the message, (lo! His) in the Hereafter (is fire of hell, wherein such dwell forever) never to die or leave it."
حَتَّىٰ إِذَا رَأَوْاْ مَا يُوعَدُونَ فَسَيَعْلَمُونَ مَنْ أَضْعَفُ نَاصِراً وَأَقَلُّ عَدَداً,(Till (the day)) He says: wait for them until the day (when they shall behold that which they are promised) of chastisement; (but then they will know for certain) this is a threat from Allah to them (who is weaker in allies and less in multitude) who has less helpers.
قُلْ إِنْ أَدْرِيۤ أَقَرِيبٌ مَّا تُوعَدُونَ أَمْ يَجْعَلُ لَهُ رَبِّيۤ أَمَداً,"(Say) to them, O Muhammad: (I know not whether that which ye are promised) of chastisement (is nigh, or if my Lord hath set a distant term for it."

لِّيَعْلَمَ أَن قَدْ أَبْلَغُواْ رِسَالاَتِ رَبِّهِمْ وَأَحَاطَ بِمَا لَدَيْهِمْ وَأَحْصَىٰ كُلَّ شَيْءٍ عَدَداً,"(That He) that Muhammad (pbuh) (may know that they) i.e. the messengers (have indeed conveyed the messages of their Lord) the angels protected them just as they are protecting you; it is also said that this means: so that the messengers, Muhammad and other messengers, know that the angels have conveyed the message from Allah; and it is also said that this means: so that the jinn and human beings know that the messengers have conveyed the messages of their Lord. (He surroundeth all their doings) He has full knowledge of all the angels that surround them, (and He keepeth count of all things) it is also said that He knows their number just as He knows the state of the one who is wrapped up in his raiment'."
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلْمُزَّمِّلُ,And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said concerning Allah's saying (O thou wrapped up in your raiment!): '(O thou wrapped up in your raiment!) He is referring here to Muhammad (pbuh) who wrapped himself up in his raiment in order to pray.
قُمِ ٱلَّيلَ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً,"(Keep vigil the night long) in prayer, then He said (save a little);"
نِّصْفَهُ أَوِ ٱنقُصْ مِنْهُ قَلِيلاً,"He explained further, saying: (A half thereof) i.e. pray during half of the night, (or abate a little thereof) less than half and up to a third of the night,"

إِنَّا سَنُلْقِي عَلَيْكَ قَوْلاً ثَقِيلاً,"(For We shall charge thee) for We shall send you Gabriel (with a word of weight) with mighty words containing commands and prohibitions, promises and threats, the lawful and unlawful; it is also said this means: with a tremendous word; and it is also said this means: a word that is heavy on whoever contravenes it; and it is also said this means: a weighty word in the prayer of the night."
إِنَّ نَاشِئَةَ ٱللَّيْلِ هِيَ أَشَدُّ وَطْأً وَأَقْوَمُ قِيلاً,"(Lo! the vigil of the night) spent in praying (is (a time) when impression is more keen) the vigil of the night and praying at this time give a person more vigour in his prayer, when he seeks by it Allah's sake alone; it is also said this means: it is gentler and milder on the heart (and speech more certain) the recitation of the Qur'an is clearer and firmer."
إِنَّ لَكَ فِي ٱلنَّهَارِ سَبْحَاً طَوِيلاً,(Lo! thou hast by day) O Muhammad (a chain of business) a long period of time to attend to your needs.

إِنَّ لَدَيْنَآ أَنكَالاً وَجَحِيماً,"(Lo! with Us) for them in the Hereafter (are heavy fetters) with which their hands will be tied to their necks and chains will also be put around their necks (and a raging fire) which they will enter,"

فَعَصَىٰ فِرْعَوْنُ ٱلرَّسُولَ فَأَخَذْنَاهُ أَخْذاً وَبِيلاً,"(But Pharaoh rebelled against the messenger) i.e. Moses, and did not accept his call, (whereupon We seized him with no gentle grip) therefore We punished him with a severe punishment, i.e. by drowning."
فَكَيْفَ تَتَّقُونَ إِن كَفَرْتُمْ يَوْماً يَجْعَلُ ٱلْوِلْدَانَ شِيباً,"(Then how) will you ward off disbelief, idolatry and indecencies, O people of Mecca (if ye disbelieve) in the life of the world, (will ye protect yourselves upon the day) the Day of Judgement (which will turn children grey) when they hear Allah say to Adam: “O Adam! Send a group from your progeny to the Fire”. Adam will say: “O Lord! How many?” Allah will say: “From every one thousand, send 999 to the Fire and one person to the Garden”,"
ٱلسَّمَآءُ مُنفَطِرٌ بِهِ كَانَ وَعْدُهُ مَفْعُولاً,(The very heaven being then) when the children turn grey; and it is said: due to the descent of the command of the Lord and the angels (rent asunder. His promise) regarding the resurrection (is to be fulfilled) is to take place.

(Allah measureth the night and the day) Allah knows the hours of the day and night. (He knoweth that ye count it not) i.e. keep track of the hours of the night; it is also said that this means: He knows you will not be able to persevere in that which you are commanded of prayer in the night, (and turneth unto you in mercy) and so He forgives you if you do not pray at night. (Recite, then, of the Qur'an) when you perform the prayers (that which is easy for you) 100 verses and more; and it is also said this means: whatever you wish to recite of the Qur'an.

This is because the Prophet (pbuh) used to repeat whatever revelations of the Qur'an Gabriel brought down to him before the latter finished a sentence of the Qur'an, out of fear of forgetting what was revealed to him. Allah warned him against doing so."
إِنَّ عَلَيْنَا جَمْعَهُ وَقُرْآنَهُ,(Lo! upon Us (resteth) the putting together thereof) preserving the Qur'an in your heart (and the reading thereof) and also preserving the reading of Gabriel to you; it is also said that this means: upon Us rests its composition of the lawful and the unlawful.

عَبَسَ وَتَوَلَّىٰ,And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said regarding the interpretation of Allah's saying (He frowned): '(He frowned) He says: Muhammad (pbuh) showed a stern face (and turned away) his face
أَن جَآءَهُ ٱلأَعْمَىٰ,"(Because the blind man came unto him) when 'Abdullah Ibn Umm Maktum came to him. His real name is 'Abdullah Ibn Shurayh. Umm Maktum was his father's mother. What happened is that the Prophet (pbuh) was sitting with a group of men among the nobles of Quraysh, among whom were his uncle al-'Abbas Ibn 'Abd al-Muttalib, Umayyah Ibn Khalaf al-Jumahi and Safwan Ibn Umayyah, who were at that time disbelievers. The Prophet (pbuh) was admonishing and inviting them to Islam when Ibn Maktum came to him and said: “O Messenger of Allah! Teach me of that which Allah has taught you”. The Prophet (pbuh) turned his face from him because he was busy with these people. When this happened Allah revealed: he frowned and turned away because the blind man came unto him."
وَمَا يُدْرِيكَ لَعَلَّهُ يَزَّكَّىٰ,(What could inform thee) O Muhammad (but that he might) i.e. the blind man (grow (in grace)) became righteous through the admonitions of the Qur'an

وَهُوَ يَخْشَىٰ,"(And hath fear) of Allah, and is also a Muslim; this is because Ibn Umm Maktum had accepted Islam before this incident,"
فَأَنتَ عَنْهُ تَلَهَّىٰ,(From him thou) O Muhammad (art distracted) being busy with those three men.
كَلاَّ إِنَّهَا تَذْكِرَةٌ,"(Nay) do not do this; He says: do not turn to those who think themselves independent of Allah and turn away from he who fears Allah. After this reminder, the Prophet (pbuh) used to honour Ibn Umm Maktum and treat him well, (but verily it) this surah (is an Admonishment) from Allah both for the rich and the poor,"

أَلَمْ نَشْرَحْ لَكَ صَدْرَكَ,"And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said concerning the interpretation of Allah's saying (Have We not caused thy bosom to dilate): '(Have We not caused thy bosom to dilate) this is in conjunction with His saying (Did He not find thee destitute and enrich (thee)?), and so Allah says: did We not open your heart for Islam? i.e. did We not soften your heart on the Day of the Covenant through knowledge, understanding, help, reason and certainty, as well as with other things? It is also said this means: did We not expand your heart through prophethood? And the Prophet (pbuh) said: “Yes, indeed!”"
وَوَضَعْنَا عَنكَ وِزْرَكَ,He said again: (And eased thee of the burden) We lifted your sins from you
ٱلَّذِيۤ أَنقَضَ ظَهْرَكَ,"(Which weighed down thy back?) It is also said: prophethood weighed down your back; And the Prophet (pbuh) said: "" Yes, indeed! """
وَرَفَعْنَا لَكَ ذِكْرَكَ,"(And exalted thy fame) and raised your voice with the call to prayer, supplication and testification of faith, such that you are mentioned just as I am? And the Prophet (pbuh) said: "" Yes, indeed! """
فَإِنَّ مَعَ ٱلْعُسْرِ يُسْراً,"Allah then said to comfort His prophet about his poverty and the hardships he faced, saying: (But lo! with hardship goeth ease,"
إِنَّ مَعَ ٱلْعُسْرِ يُسْراً,Lo! with hardship goeth ease;
فَإِذَا فَرَغْتَ فَٱنصَبْ,"So when thou art relieved) when you finish from military expeditions, jihad and fighting, (still toil) in worship; and it is also said this means: when you finish from the prescribed prayers, make supplications"
وَإِلَىٰ رَبِّكَ فَٱرْغَبْ,(And strive to please thy Lord) and ask your needs from your Lord'.
وَٱلتِّينِ وَٱلزَّيْتُونِ,"And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said regarding the interpretation of Allah's saying (By the fig and the olive): '(By the fig and the olive) He says: Allah swears by the fig, this fig of yours, and the olive, this olive of yours; it is also said the fig and the olive refer to two mountains in Historic Syria; it is also said that the fig refers to the hill upon which Jerusalem is built while the olive refers to the mountain upon which Damascus is built,"
وَطُورِ سِينِينَ,"(By Mount Sinai) and He swears by the mountain of Thubayr which is the mountain of Midian where Allah spoke to Moses (pbuh),"
وَهَـٰذَا ٱلْبَلَدِ ٱلأَمِينِ,(And by this land made safe) and He swears by Mecca which is made safe in that whoever enters it is safe;
لَقَدْ خَلَقْنَا ٱلإِنسَانَ فِيۤ أَحْسَنِ تَقْوِيمٍ,"(Surely We created man) the disbelieving man, referring here to al-Walid Ibn al-Mughirah, and it is also said it refers to Kildah Ibn Usayd (of the best stature) in the best of forms; and this is the reason why the oath was made."
ثُمَّ رَدَدْنَاهُ أَسْفَلَ سَافِلِينَ,"(Then We reduced him) in the Hereafter (to the lowest of the low) i.e. the Fire; it is also said that the above means: We have created the children of Adam in the best of forms when they are in the pick of their youth, then We reduce them to abject old age whereby no good deed is recorded in their favour except that which they used to do in their youth and prime,"
إِلاَّ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ فَلَهُمْ أَجْرٌ غَيْرُ مَمْنُونٍ,"(Save those who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an (and do good works) and do acts of obedience in private between themselves and their Lord, (and theirs is a reward unfailing) their reward is undiminished and unspoilt, good deeds will still be written for them even in old age and after they die."
فَمَا يُكَذِّبُكَ بَعْدُ بِٱلدِّينِ,"(So who henceforth) i.e. after what I have mentioned to you of the transformation of youth and old age, life and death (will give the lie to thee) O Muhammad (about the judgement) about the Day of Reckoning? It is also said this means: what has driven you, O Kildah Ibn Usayd and Walid Ibn al-Mughirah, to deny the Day of Judgement?"
أَلَيْسَ ٱللَّهُ بِأَحْكَمِ ٱلْحَاكِمِينَ,"(Is not Allah the most conclusive of all judges?) Is not Allah the most just of those who are just and the best of those who are best and is, therefore, able to bring you back to life, O Walid!'"
ٱقْرَأْ بِٱسْمِ رَبِّكَ ٱلَّذِي خَلَقَ,"And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said regarding the interpretation of Allah's saying (Read): '(Read) He says: Read, O Muhammad, the Qur'an; this is the first revelation that Gabriel brought down: (In the name of thy Lord) by the command of your Lord (Who createth) the created beings,"
خَلَقَ ٱلإِنسَانَ مِنْ عَلَقٍ,(Createth man) i.e. the son of Adam (from a clot) and the Prophet (pbuh) said: “what shall I read?” And Gabriel read to him the first four verses of this surah.
ٱقْرَأْ وَرَبُّكَ ٱلأَكْرَمُ,"He said to him: (Read) the Qur'an, O Muhammad: (And thy Lord is the Most Bounteous) and your Lord is Clement and forgives the ignorance of the servants,"
ٱلَّذِى عَلَّمَ بِٱلْقَلَمِ,"(Who teacheth by the pen) Who teaches writing by the pen,"
عَلَّمَ ٱلإِنسَانَ مَا لَمْ يَعْلَمْ,(Teacheth man) writing with the pen (that which be knew not) before this; it is also said: He taught man the names of all things which he previously did not know.
كَلاَّ إِنَّ ٱلإِنسَانَ لَيَطْغَىٰ,"(Nay, but verily) O Muhammad (man) i.e. the disbeliever (is rebellious) is a wanton, he moves from one position to another with regard to his food, drink, clothing and mount"
أَن رَّآهُ ٱسْتَغْنَىٰ,(That he thinketh himself independent) of Allah because of his wealth!
إِنَّ إِلَىٰ رَبِّكَ ٱلرُّجْعَىٰ,(Lo! unto thy Lord) O Muhammad (is the return) of all created beings in the Hereafter.
أَرَأَيْتَ ٱلَّذِي يَنْهَىٰ,Then it was revealed about Abu Jahl Ibn Hisham when he wanted to step on the neck of the Prophet (pbuh) while he was in prayer: (Hast thou seen him) O Muhammad (who dissuadeth
عَبْداً إِذَا صَلَّىٰ,A slave) i.e. Muhammad (pbuh) (when he prayeth) to Allah?
أَرَأَيْتَ إِن كَانَ عَلَىٰ ٱلْهُدَىٰ,(Hast thou seen if he (relieth) on the guidance (of Allah)) i.e. Muhammad (pbuh) is following the guidance: prophethood and Islam
أَوْ أَمَرَ بِٱلتَّقْوَىٰ,(Or enjoineth piety) and enjoins belief in Allah's divine Oneness?
أَرَأَيْتَ إِن كَذَّبَ وَتَوَلَّىٰ,(Hast thou seen if he denieth (Allah's guidance)) and Abu Jahl disbelieved in Allah's divine Oneness (and is froward) and turned away from faith?
أَلَمْ يَعْلَم بِأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَرَىٰ,(Is he) Abu Jahl (then unaware that Allah seeth) what he did to the Prophet (pbuh)?
كَلاَّ لَئِن لَّمْ يَنتَهِ لَنَسْفَعاً بِٱلنَّاصِيَةِ,"(Nay) truly, O Muhammad, (but if he cease not) if Abu Jahl does not repent of harming the Prophet (pbuh). (We will seize him by the forelock"
نَاصِيَةٍ كَاذِبَةٍ خَاطِئَةٍ,"The lying) about Allah, (sinful forelock) that ascribes partners to Allah"
فَلْيَدْعُ نَادِيَهُ,(Then let him call upon his henchmen) his folk and companions!
سَنَدْعُ ٱلزَّبَانِيَةَ,(We will call the guards of hell) i.e. the keepers of hell.
كَلاَّ لاَ تُطِعْهُ وَٱسْجُدْ وَٱقْتَرِب,"(Nay) truly, O Muhammad! (Obey not thou him) i.e. obey not Abu Jahl when he wants you not to pray to your Lord. (But prostrate thyself) to your Lord, (and draw near (unto Allah)) through prostration."
إِنَّا أَنزَلْنَاهُ فِي لَيْلَةِ ٱلْقَدْرِ,"And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said regarding the interpretation of Allah's saying (Lo! We revealed it): '(Lo! We revealed it) He says: We sent Gabriel with the entire Qur'an to the scribes of the nether heaven (on the Night of Power) on the night of judgement and decree; it is also said this means: on a night blessed with forgiveness and mercy, and then it was revealed to the Prophet (pbuh) in instalments."
وَمَآ أَدْرَاكَ مَا لَيْلَةُ ٱلْقَدْرِ,"(Ah, what will convey unto thee) O Muhammad-this is said out of glorification of this night-(what the Night of Power is) what the merit of the Night of Power is!"
لَيْلَةُ ٱلْقَدْرِ خَيْرٌ مِّنْ أَلْفِ شَهْرٍ,"He then explained its merit by saying: (The Night of Power is better than a thousand months) He says: works in this night are better than works performed in 1,000 months which do not include such a night."
تَنَزَّلُ ٱلْمَلاَئِكَةُ وَٱلرُّوحُ فِيهَا بِإِذْنِ رَبِّهِم مِّن كُلِّ أَمْرٍ,"(The angels and the Spirit) Gabriel with them (descend therein) at the beginning of the Night of Power, (by the permission of their Lord) by the command of their Lord, (with all decrees."

لَمْ يَكُنِ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِنْ أَهْلِ ٱلْكِتَابِ وَٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ مُنفَكِّينَ حَتَّىٰ تَأْتِيَهُمُ ٱلْبَيِّنَةُ,"And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said regarding the interpretation of Allah's saying (Those who disbelieve among the People of the Scripture): '(Those who disbelieve among the People of the Scripture) i.e. the Jews and Christians (and the idolaters) the Arab idolaters (could not have left off (erring)) could not have remained in their denial of Muhammad (pbuh) the Qur'an and Islam (till the clear proof came unto them) until clarification of what is in their Scriptures, the Scriptures of the Jews and Christians, came to them. There is another way of understanding the above: those who disbelieve among the people of the Scripture, before the advent Muhammad (pbuh) such as 'Abdullah Ibn Salam and his followers, and those who ascribed partners to Allah before the advent of Muhammad (pbuh) such as Abu Bakr and his fellow Arabs, would not have desisted from their disbelief and idolatry until the clear proof came to them, i.e. until Muhammad (pbuh) came to them."
رَسُولٌ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ يَتْلُواْ صُحُفاً مُّطَهَّرَةً,(A messenger from Allah) i.e. Muhammad (pbuh) (reading) to them (purified pages) pages purified from idolatry

وَمَا تَفَرَّقَ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ ٱلْكِتَابَ إِلاَّ مِن بَعْدِ مَا جَآءَتْهُمُ ٱلْبَيِّنَةُ,"(Nor were the People of the Scripture divided) those who were given the Torah, i.e. Ka'b Ibn al-Ashraf and his host, did not differ about Muhammad (pbuh) the Qur'an and Islam (until after the clear proof came unto them) until the clarification of what is in their Scripture regarding the traits and description of Muhammad (pbuh) came to them."
وَمَآ أُمِرُوۤاْ إِلاَّ لِيَعْبُدُواْ ٱللَّهَ مُخْلِصِينَ لَهُ ٱلدِّينَ حُنَفَآءَ وَيُقِيمُواْ ٱلصَّلاَةَ وَيُؤْتُواْ ٱلزَّكَاةَ وَذَلِكَ دِينُ ٱلقَيِّمَةِ,"(And they are ordered) in all the Scriptures (naught else than to serve Allah) nothing else but to profess Allah's divine Oneness, (keeping religion pure for Him) through the profession of Allah's divine Oneness, (as men by nature upright) as ones surrendered unto Him, (and to establish worship) and perform the five daily prayers after declaring their profession in Allah's divine Oneness (and to pay the poor-due) from their wealth after that. Allah then mentioned belief in Allah's divine Oneness, saying: (That) i.e. belief in Allah's divine Oneness (is true religion) the religion of truth, straight without any crookedness; it is also said that this means: that, i.e. belief in Allah's divine Oneness, is the religion of the angels; and it is also said this means: it is the religion of those who are by nature upright; and it is also said this means: the religion of Abraham."
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِنْ أَهْلِ ٱلْكِتَابِ وَٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ فِي نَارِ جَهَنَّمَ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَآ أَوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمْ شَرُّ ٱلْبَرِيَّةِ,"(Lo! those who disbelieve) in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an, (among the People of the Scripture and the idolaters) i.e. the idolaters among the people of Mecca, (will abide in fire of hell) never to die therein or leave it.

جَزَآؤُهُمْ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ جَنَّاتُ عَدْنٍ تَجْرِى مِنْ تَحْتِهَا ٱلأَنْهَارُ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَآ أَبَداً رِّضِىَ ٱللَّهُ عَنْهُمْ وَرَضُواْ عَنْهُ ذَلِكَ لِمَنْ خَشِيَ رَبَّهُ,"Their reward is with their Lord: Gardens of Eden) the chamber of the Beneficent, the source of the prophets and those near to Him (beneath which) beneath whose trees, habitations and rooms (rivers flow) rivers of wine, water, honey and milk, (wherein they dwell forever) they remain in Paradise for ever never to die or leave it. (Allah hath pleasure in them) i.e. in their faith and works (and they have pleasure in Him) in His reward and bestowal of honour upon Him. (This) i.e. the Gardens and good pleasure (is (in store) for him who feareth his Lord) is for him who believes in Allah's divine Oneness such as Abu Bakr al-Siddiq and his companions and 'Abdullah Ibn Salam and his followers'."
إِذَا زُلْزِلَتِ ٱلأَرْضُ زِلْزَالَهَا,"And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said about the interpretation of Allah's saying (When Earth is shaken with her (final) earthquake): '(When Earth is shaken with her (final) earthquake) He says: the earth is shaken and quaking and all that which is on it of trees, mountains and building is crumbling down"
وَأَخْرَجَتِ ٱلأَرْضُ أَثْقَالَهَا,"(And Earth yieldeth up her burdens) and the Earth brings out her dead and treasures,"
وَقَالَ ٱلإِنسَانُ مَا لَهَا,(And man) i.e. the disbeliever (saith: What aileth her?) He says this in astonishment from the horror he sees
يَوْمَئِذٍ تُحَدِّثُ أَخْبَارَهَا,"(That day) when the earth is shaken (she will relate her chronicles) the earth will inform about the good and evil that were done on its surface,"
بِأَنَّ رَبَّكَ أَوْحَىٰ لَهَا,(Because thy Lord inspires her) because your Lord gives her leave to talk.
يَوْمَئِذٍ يَصْدُرُ ٱلنَّاسُ أَشْتَاتاً لِّيُرَوْاْ أَعْمَالَهُمْ,"(That day) when the earth speaks (mankind will issue forth in scattered groups) a group will go to Paradise, these are the believers, and a group will go to hell, and these are the disbelievers (to be shown their deeds) what they have done of good or evil when they were in the life of the world."
فَمَن يَعْمَلْ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ خَيْراً يَرَهُ,"Allah then revealed the following verse about a group of people who thought that they are not rewarded for any small goodness they do nor punished for any small evil they commit, and so Allah urged them to do acts of goodness even if they are small and warned them against acts of evil even if they are small acts: (And whoso doeth good an atom's weight) the weight of the smallest ant (will see it then) in his register and then will be happy with it; it is also said: the believer sees his works in the Hereafter while the disbeliever sees his works in the life of the world,"
وَمَن يَعْـمَلْ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ شَرّاً يَرَهُ,(And whoso doeth ill an atom's weight) the weight of a small atom (will see it then) is written in his register and will displease him; and it is also said: the believer sees it in the life of the world while the disbeliever sees it in the Hereafter'.
وَٱلْعَادِيَاتِ ضَبْحاً,"And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said about the interpretation of Allah's saying (By the snorting courses): '(By the snorting courses) the Prophet (pbuh) had sent a military expedition to Banu Kinanah and was quite aggrieved because he did not hear their news for a while. Allah therefore informed His Prophet about this expedition in the form of an oath, saying (By the snorting courses) He says: Allah swears by the horses of the conquerors, whose breaths are audible because of the enemies,"
فَٱلمُورِيَاتِ قَدْحاً,"(Striking sparks of fire) with their hooves, but this fire is as beneficial as the Fire of Abu Hubahib. The latter was one of the stingiest Arabs in camp. He never lit any fire to make bread for himself or for anyone else until everybody went to sleep, and whenever someone woke up he hurried to put the Fire out so that no one would benefit from it."
فَٱلْمُغِيرَاتِ صُبْحاً,"(And scouring to the raid at dawn,"
فَأَثَرْنَ بِهِ نَقْعاً,"Then, therewith, with their trail of dust,"
فَوَسَطْنَ بِهِ جَمْعاً,"Cleaving, as one, the centre (of the foe)) the above can also be understood as follow: Allah swears by the pilgrims' horses and camels when they return from 'Arafah to Muzdalifah snorting and striking sparks of fire; it is also said the latter means: performing acts which leads them to safety, i.e. the pilgrimage. And He swears by these when they go at dawn from Muzdalifah to Mina in the evening, leaving trails of dust and surrounding their enemies. Allah swore by all these."
إِنَّ ٱلإِنسَانَ لِرَبِّهِ لَكَنُودٌ,"(Lo! Man) i.e. the disbelieving man: Qurt Ibn 'Abdullah Ibn 'Amr; and it is also said it refers to Abu Hubahib (is an ingrate unto his Lord) He says: he is ungrateful for the blessings of his Lord; it is also said this means: He is disobedient of his Lord; and it is also said this means: he is stingy; and it is also said this means: he denies those who are dependent on him, starves his slaves, eats alone and does not give those who are his relatives among his folk."
وَإِنَّهُ عَلَىٰ ذَلِكَ لَشَهِيدٌ,(And lo! he is a witness unto that) and Allah records His doing;
وَإِنَّهُ لِحُبِّ ٱلْخَيْرِ لَشَدِيدٌ,(And lo! in the love of wealth) abundant wealth (he) i.e. Qurt (is violent) is extreme.
أَفَلاَ يَعْلَمُ إِذَا بُعْثِرَ مَا فِي ٱلْقُبُورِ,"(Knoweth he not) i.e. Abu Hubahib; and it is also said: Qurt (that, when the contents of the graves) the dead (are poured forth"
وَحُصِّلَ مَا فِي ٱلصُّدُورِ,"And the secrets of the breasts) what is in the hearts of good and evil, miserliness and generosity (are made known."
إِنَّ رَبَّهُم بِهِمْ يَوْمَئِذٍ لَّخَبِيرٌ,On that day) the Day of Judgement (will their Lord be perfectly informed concerning them) their Lord is perfectly Aware'.
ٱلْقَارِعَةُ,And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said regarding the interpretation of Allah's saying (Calamity! What is the Calamity?): '(Calamity!
مَا ٱلْقَارِعَةُ,What is the Calamity?) He says: the Hour! What is the Hour? He said this to arouse his wonder; the Hour is called Calamity because it shakes people's hearts.
وَمَآ أَدْرَاكَ مَا ٱلْقَارِعَةُ,"(Ah, what will convey unto thee) O Muhammad (what the Calamity is!) he said this to show its tremendousness."
يَوْمَ يَكُونُ ٱلنَّاسُ كَٱلْفَرَاشِ ٱلْمَبْثُوثِ,"Allah then gave more details about it, saying: (A day wherein mankind will be) a day when people will fall on each other (as thickly scattered moths"
وَتَكُونُ ٱلْجِبَالُ كَٱلْعِهْنِ ٱلْمَنفُوشِ,And the mountains will become as carded wool.
فَأَمَّا مَن ثَقُلَتْ مَوَازِينُهُ,"Then, as for him whose scales are heavy (with good works)) as for him whose good works weigh heavy on his scale; this refers to the believer,"
فَهُوَ فِي عِيشَةٍ رَّاضِيَةٍ,"(He will live a pleasant life) He will be in a pleasant Paradise, pleasing to himself."
وَأَمَّا مَنْ خَفَّتْ مَوَازِينُهُ,"(But as for him whose scales are light) i.e. the disbeliever,"
فَأُمُّهُ هَاوِيَةٌ,(The Bereft and Hungry One will be his mother) his abode and destination will be the Fire; it is also said this means: he will be thrown in the Fire.
وَمَآ أَدْرَاكَ مَا هِيَهْ,"(Ah, what will convey unto thee) O Muhammad (what she is!) this is to show how tremendous she is,"
نَارٌ حَامِيَةٌ,(Raging fire) extremely hot'.
أَلْهَاكُمُ ٱلتَّكَّاثُرُ,And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said about the interpretation of Allah's saying (Rivalry in worldly increase distracteth you): '(Rivalry in worldly increase distracteth you) He says: bragging about your status and lineage has distracted you
حَتَّىٰ زُرْتُمُ ٱلْمَقَابِرَ,"(Until ye come to the graves) this is because the Banu Sahm and Banu 'Abd Manaf were bragging to each other about which tribe is larger as concerns the number of its population, and found out that the Banu 'Abd Manaf were more numerous. The Banu Sahm said at that point: “We were rooted out by injustice in the pagan era; go and count the living and the dead of our people and the living and the dead of your people”. When they did so they found out that the Banu Sahm were more numerous. Therefore the above verses were revealed about them: bragging about status and lineage distracted you to the extent that you visited the graveyards to count the dead; it is also said that this means: increase in wealth and children distracts you until you die and be put in the graves."
كَلاَّ سَوْفَ تَعْلَمُونَ,"(Nay) this is a reply and threat to them, (but ye will come to know) what will be done to you in the graves!"
ثُمَّ كَلاَّ سَوْفَ تَعْلَمُونَ,"(Nay, but ye will come to know!) what will be done to you when you die!"
كَلاَّ لَوْ تَعْلَمُونَ عِلْمَ ٱلْيَقِينِ,"(Nay, would that ye knew (now)) what will be done to you on the Day of Judgement (with a sure knowledge!) what you bragged about in the life of the world!"

ثُمَّ لَتَرَوُنَّهَا عَيْنَ ٱلْيَقِينِ,"(Aye, ye will behold it with sure vision) which cannot be missed on the Day of Judgement."
ثُمَّ لَتُسْأَلُنَّ يَوْمَئِذٍ عَنِ ٱلنَّعِيمِ,"(Then, on that day) on the Day of Judgement, (ye will be asked concerning pleasure) you will be asked about whether you gave thanks for all the bounties you enjoyed, of food, drink, clothing, etc'."
وَٱلْعَصْرِ,"And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said about the interpretation of Allah's saying (By the declining day): (By the declining day) Allah swears by the 'Asr prayer; and it is also said by the hardships of time,"

إِلاَّ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ وَتَوَاصَوْاْ بِٱلْحَقِّ وَتَوَاصَوْاْ بِٱلصَّبْرِ,"(Save those who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an (and do good works) and do acts of obedience privately between them and their Lord, (and exhort one another to truth) to belief in Allah's divine Oneness; and it is said to the Qur'an (and exhort one another to endurance) in performing the obligations imposed by Allah and in avoiding transgressions and also in enduring misfortunes and calamities, because the believers are unlike the disbelievers'."
ويْلٌ لِّكُلِّ هُمَزَةٍ لُّمَزَةٍ,"And from his narration on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas that he said about the interpretation of Allah's saying (Woe): '(Woe) severe punishment; and it is also said that this refers to a valley in Gehenna which is full of blood and puss; and it is also said that it refers to a well in the Fire (unto every slandering) who backbites people (traducer) and slanders and abuses them in their face. This verses was revealed about Akhnas Ibn Shurayq, or al-Walid Ibn al-Mughirah al-Makhzumi, who used to backbite the Prophet (pbuh) and also abuse him when in his presence."
ٱلَّذِى جَمَعَ مَالاً وَعَدَّدَهُ,(Who hath gathered wealth (of this world) and arranged it) and counted it; and it is also said: counted his camels.
يَحْسَبُ أَنَّ مَالَهُ أَخْلَدَهُ,(He) the disbeliever (thinketh that his wealth will render him immortal) in the life of the world.
كَلاَّ لَيُنبَذَنَّ فِي ٱلْحُطَمَةِ,"(Nay) this is a reply to him: it will not render him immortal in the life of the world, (but verily he will be flung to the Consuming One."
وَمَآ أَدْرَاكَ مَا ٱلْحُطَمَةُ,"Ah, what will convey unto thee) O Muhammad (what the Consuming One is!) He said this to show its tremendousness."
نَارُ ٱللَّهِ ٱلْمُوقَدَةُ,"Then He explained, saying: ((It is) the Fire of Allah, kindled) for the disbelievers,"
ٱلَّتِي تَطَّلِعُ عَلَى ٱلأَفْئِدَةِ,(Which leapeth up over the hearts (of men)) which consumes everything until it reaches the hearts.
