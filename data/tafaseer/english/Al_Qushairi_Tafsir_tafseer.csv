Arabic,Tafseer
بِسمِ ٱلله الرَّحْمٰنِ الرَّحِيـمِ,In the Name of God the Compassionate the Merciful The bāÌ in bismillāh [“in the name of God”] is a grammatical particle of implication. That is to say “by means of God” bi-Llāh new things become manifest and by means of Him created things exist. There is nothing from any newly created thing ḥādith makhlūq or sequence of events ḥāṣil mansūq; or from any perceived thing ʿayn or trace left by a thing athar etc.; or anything else from rocks or clay grass or trees any impression left on the ground rasm or ruins left standing Ṭalal or any determination ḥukm or causes ʿilal [of things or events] that has existence wujūd except by means of the Real. The Real is its sovereign. Its beginning is from the Real and its return is to the Real. Through Him the one who declares the unity [of God] finds bihi wajada man waḥḥada and through Him the rejecter abandons faith wa-bihi jahada man alḥada. Through Him the one who acknowledges comes to know bihi ʿarafa man iʿtarafa and through Him the one who commits [harmful acts] remains behind wa-bihi takhallafa man iqtarafa. He said “In the name of God” rather than “In God.” According to some people this is a way of seeking blessing through the mention of His name. According to others it is because of the difference between this [wording] and oaths. According to scholars it is because the name ism is the thing that is named musammā. In the view of the people of deep knowledge ahl al-ʿirfān [the wording is such] in order to seek the purification of hearts from attachments li-istiṣfāÌ al-qulūb min al-ʿalāÌiq and the liberation of the innermost selves from obstacles li-istikhlāṣ al-asrār ʿan al-ʿawāÌiq so that the word “God” may enter into a clean heart qalb munaqqā and purified innermost self sirr muṣaffa. Upon the mention of this verse some people are reminded by the [let- ter] bāÌ of His beneficence birr with His friends and by the [letter] sīn of His secret sirr with his chosen ones and by the [letter] mīm of His grace minna to the people of [His] friendship ahl al-walāya. They know that by His beneficence they come to know His secret and by His grace to them they preserve His command and by Him سبحانه وتعالى they recognize His measure.
ٱلْحَمْدُ للَّهِ رَبِّ ٱلْعَالَمِينَ,The real meaning of praise ḥamd is extolling the One who is praiseworthy maḥmūd by mentioning His sublime attributes and beautiful acts. The [letter] lām here [from the particle al in al-ḥamdu li-Llāh] indicates an all- comprehensive category since all praiseworthy acts are God's سبحانه either by attribution waṣf or creation khalq. Praise belongs to Him because of the manifestation of His sovereign power and gratitude belongs to Him because of the abundance of His goodness. Praise belongs to God because of what He is due from His sublimity and His beauty and gratitude belongs to God because of the plentitude of His favors and the preciousness of His gifts. The praise for Him سبحانه which is from Him is from the attributes of His speech and word and the praise of Him which is from His creation is by virtue of His favors and His might. His sublimity and His beauty are His due because of the attributes of grandeur. They are His entitlement because of [His] qualities of exaltedness and loftiness. Eternal existence belongs to Him. Noble generosity belongs to Him. Unique permanence belongs to Him as do everlasting being eternal remaining endless splendor and perpetual praise. Hearing and seeing belong to Him as do divine decree and measure speech might and power mercy and generosity entity ʿayn and existence wujūd the beautiful face al-wajhu dhū l-jamāl and the sublime measure al-qadru dhū l-jalāl. He is the One most high. His grandeur is His garment His loftiness is His brilliance His magnificence is His exaltedness His being is His essence His eternity without beginning is His everlasting eternity His timelessness is His endless eternity His truth is His self and His permanence is His entity. His perpetuity is His remaining His decree is His measure His sublimity is His beauty His prohibition is His command His wrath is His mercy and His desire is His will. He is the King by His invincibility jabarūt and the One in His dominion malakūt. God the blessed and glorified! Glory be to Him how weighty is His affair! The Real سبحانه وتعالى knows the intensity of the spiritual desire irāda of His friends to praise and extol Him and their inability to perform the praise due to Him in accordance with His exaltedness and radiance.
ٱلرَّحْمـٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ,The Compassionate the Merciful Both names are derived from [the word] mercy raḥma. Mercy is an eternal attribute and it is the [divine] desire for blessing irādat al-niʿma. According to the [scholarly] experts ahl al-taḥqīq these are two nouns denoting intensification with no distinction between the two [in terms of the recipients of the mercy]. [Others have] said the Compassionate al-raḥmān is the more emphatic and more complete in expressiveness. Nothing other than the Real سبحانه is called raḥmān without restriction whereas the Merciful al-raḥīm can be used to describe others. By means of His mercy the servant comes to know that He is the Compassionate. If not for His mercy no one would know that He is the Compassionate. Whether mercy is the desire for blessing or the blessing itself as some would have it the blessings themselves are varied and their degrees are different for one blessing is a blessing for bodily forms and outward circumstances al-ashbāḥ wa-l-ẓawāhir and the other blessing is a blessing for spirits and inner secrets of the heart al-arwāḥ wa-l-sarāÌir. In the system of those who distinguish between the two the compassion- ate raḥmān is a specific term with a general meaning while the merciful raḥīm is a general term with a specific meaning. As the Compassionate He provides comfort for all people in the circumstances of their exter- nal lives ẓawāhir whereas the Merciful grants success to the believers for the life found in the inner secrets of their hearts sarāÌir. He is the Compassionate by that which He gives in comfort rawwaḥa and the Merciful by that which He gives in glimmers lawwaḥa. Giving com- fort tarwīḥ is through acts of beneficence mabārr and the giving of glimmers talwīḥ is through lights anwār. [He is] the Compassionate through the unveiling of His manifestation tajallī and the Merciful through the kindness of His being a friend and protector tawallī. [He is] the Compassionate through what He gives in faith īmān and the Merciful through what He confers in deep knowledge ʿirfān. Or [He is] the Compassionate through what He grants in deeper knowledge ʿirfān and the Merciful through what He undertakes in forgiveness ghufrān. Or [He is] the Compassionate through what He gives in blessing in forgive- ness ghufrān and the Merciful through what He bestows in good pleasure riḌwān.
مَـٰلِكِ يَوْمِ ٱلدِّينِ,Master of the Day of Judgment The master mālik is the one who has sovereignty mulk. The sovereignty of the Real سبحانه وتعالى is His power over creating ibdāʿ. King malik is a more intensive form than master mālik-He سبحانه is both King and Master and sovereignty is His. Just as there is no god but He there is none with the power to create except Him. He is alone in His divinity and singular in His sovereignty. He rules the souls of His worshipers nufūs al-ʿābidīn for He has granted agency to them ṣarrafahā in His service. He rules the hearts of those with deeper knowledge qulūb al-ʿārifīn for He hon- ors them sharrafahā with knowledge of Him. He rules the souls of the seekers nufūs al-qāṣidīn for He holds them in his thrall tayyamahā. He rules the hearts of the ecstatics qulūb al-wājidīn for He bewilders them hayyamahā. He rules the bodily forms ashbāḥ of those who worship Him and He is kind to them with his gifts and favors. He rules the spirits arwāḥ of those whom He loves and He unveils the attribute of His majesty to them and the quality of His beauty. He holds the reins of the masters who profess [His] unity: He turns them about wherever He wills as He wills and He grants them success wherever He wills as He wills. He does not entrust them to themselves for even a moment. He does not transfer power to them in their affair for even the shortest period of time. He is for them in place of themselves and He has annihilated them from themselves to Him. His beneficence rules the hearts of the worshipers and they desire His gifts. His authority rules the hearts of those who declare unity and they are content with His abiding. He teaches the masters who profess [His] unity that He is their Master mālik and their own choosing ikhtiyār drops away from them. They come to know that the servant has no ownership. The one who has no ownership has no power of decision ḥukm and the one who has no power of decision has no free choice. For them there is no turning away iʿrāḌ from obedience to Him no resistance iʿtirāḌ to His decision no working against muʿāraḌa His choosing and no move to taʿarruḌ oppose Him.
إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ,You [alone] we worship and You [alone] we ask for help Its meaning is “we worship You and we ask for help through You” but beginning with the mention of the object of worship is better than begin- ning with the mention of the servant's attribute which is his worship and seeking help. This is a more eloquent wording and more pleasing to the ears. Worship is bringing the utmost humility in harmony muwāfaqa with the command standing wherever the law stands and asking for help in seeking the assistance of the Real. Worship ʿibāda refers to the exertion of effort and strength while asking for help istiʿāna indicates the search to attract power and grace. So in worship the honor of the servant becomes manifest and in asking for help kindness comes to the servant. In worship he finds his honor and in asking for help he is granted security from harm. The outward aspect of worship is humbling oneself tadhallul but its inward truth is becoming powerful taʿazzuz and beautiful tajammul: When necks are brought low dhallalat in being brought near between us their glory ʿizz is in their humility dhull. Its meaning is: As soon as you caused me to submit to dhāl and lām you met me in ʿayn and zāÌ. Worship is the promenade of the seekers qāṣidūn the recreation of the aspirants murīdūn the meadow of intimacy for the lovers muḥibbūn and the pasture of delight for those with deeper knowledge ʿārifūn. Their eyes are cooled by [worship] their hearts find joy in it and their spirits have rest from it. [The Prophet] ﷺ alluded to this in saying “Give us rest O Bilāl.” One created being said about another created being: O people my blood revenge belongs to my AsmāÌ. Anyone near and far knows it. Do not call upon me except by “O servant of her” For that is the most truthful of my names. To ask for help is to alight in the environs of His generosity to put your burden down in the courtyard of His munificence and to submit your burden to the hand of His rule. So you seek Him full of hope take long strides toward Him hope in Him with powerful anticipation have faith in His eternal generosity trust in what has already been chosen ikhtiyār sābiq and cling to the strong rope of His liberality.
ٱهْدِنَا ٱلصِّرَاطَ ٱلْمُسْتَقِيمَ,Guide us to the straight path Guidance hidāya is direction irshād and its basic meaning is to influence someone's inclinations. The one who is guided is one who is aware of the Real سبحانه and prefers His good pleasure and has faith in Him. The com- mand in this verse is elided for the meaning is “Say: Guide us.” The believers are already being rightly guided in the present moment so the meaning is to petition for ongoing and ever increasing [guidance]. The straight path is the true path upon which are the people who declare God's oneness. The meaning of guide us is “cause us to incline to You” “take us as Yours” “be our guide dalīl to You” “facilitate our way to You” “arouse our aspira- tion for You” and “bring our concerns together through You.” “Prevent our innermost selves from witnessing all others aghyār. Show in our hearts the rising of lights anwār. Keep our seeking of You from the blemish of traces or effects āthār.65 And cause us to rise from the waystations of studying and reasoning to gather jamʿ [together] on the plains of nearness and communion.” “Take away our comfort with simulacra amthāl and outward appear- ances ashkāl through the intimate kindnesses and secrets you share with us [as we] find communion and witness the sublime and beautiful.” “Direct us to the Real so that we will not put our trust in the intermediar- ies of [our] deeds and so that the dust of vain opinions and suppositions will not fall upon the intent to profess divine unity.” Guide us to the straight path that is “Remove from us the darkness of our states so that we may be illuminated by the lights of Your holiness from the shadows of our own seeking. And lift from us the shadow of our effort so that we may gain insight by the stars of Your liberality and find You through You.” “Guide us to the straight path so that no associate from Satan's insinua- tions and whisperings and no friend from the inclinations and murmurings of the lower selves become our companions. Let not any stay in the familiar territories of blind following taqlīd keep us from the communion [of lovers]. Do not let reliance on routine instruction come between us and insight.
صِرَاطَ ٱلَّذِينَ أَنْعَمْتَ عَلَيْهِمْ غَيْرِ ٱلْمَغْضُوبِ عَلَيْهِم وَلاَ ٱلضَّآلِّينَ,the path of those whom You have favored It means “the way Ṭarīq of those whom You have favored with guid- ance to the straight path”-these are the friends awliyāÌ and chosen ones aṣfiyāÌ. It is said that it is “the way of those whom You have annihilated from themselves and raised up through You for You. They do not stop along the way and the secrets of the divine ruse makr do not keep them from You.” It is said that it is “the path of those whom You have favored with upholding Your rights ḥuqūq without detours seeking to attract their worldly portions ḥuẓūẓ.” It is said that it is “the path of those whom You have purified from their [human] traces āthār so that they reach You through You.” It is said that it is “the path of those whom You have favored to the point that they are wary of66 the tricks of Satan the errors of the lower selves and the imaginings of opinions and conjectures about arriving before the mortal human traces āthār al-bashariyya are extinguished.” It is said that it is “the path of those whom You have favored with reflec- tive thought naẓar [those who] seek help through You declare them- selves free of power and strength witness the felicity that has already been determined for them and have knowledge through the affirmation of Your unity of that which will come to pass [thus] causing happiness and harm.” It is said that it is “the path of those whom You have favored with being mindful of refined behavior adab at the times of service and [with] being filled with the quality of awe hayba.” It is said that it is “the path of those whom You have favored by causing them to be mindful of the refined behaviors ādāb and precepts aḥkām of the law [even while they are] under the sway of the unexpected intu- itions of realities bawādih al-ḥaqāÌiq so that they do not go beyond the limit of knowledge ʿilm and do not violate any of the precepts of the law sharīʿa.” It is said that it is “the path of those whom You have favored so that the suns of what they have come to know will not extinguish the lights of their scrupulousness waraʿ and they will not neglect any one of the precepts of servanthood ʿubūdiyya at the time of the manifestation of the authority of reality sulṬān al-ḥaqīqa.
الۤـمۤ,Alif lām mīm According to some people these isolated letters at the beginning of the sūra are among the ambiguous [verses] the interpretation taÌwīl of which is known only to God. They say every book has a mystery and the mystery of God in the QurÌān is these isolated letters. According to other people they are acronyms for His names: the alif is from the name “Allah” the lām indicates His name al-LaṬīf “the Subtle” and the mīm indicates His names al-Majīd “the Glorious” and al-Malik “the King”. It is said that God made an oath by means of these letters an honor they hold because they are the basic elements of His names and His speech. It is said that they are the names of sūras [of the QurÌān]. It is said that the alif indicates the name Allāh the lām indicates the name Jibrīl Gabriel and the mīm indicates the name Muḥammad ﷺ since this Book descended from God on the tongue of Gabriel to Muḥammad ﷺ. Among the [Arabic] letters alif is independent infaradat in its form because it does not connect to other letters in writing; all but a few of the letters connect. By contemplating this quality the servant becomes aware of the need of all creation for Him and His self-sufficiency from all. It is said that the sincere servant remembers from the status of the alif the absolute freedom of the Real سبحانه وتعالى from being particularized by place. All of the letters have a place in the throat the lip or the tongue etc. for articulation except alif. It is His “He-ness” huwiyyaand is not ascribed to any place. It is said that the allusion in [the alif] is to the servant's standing alone infirād for the sake of God سبحانه وتعالى so that he would be like the alif which is not connected to any letter and [he] would not abandon the state of standing straight and upright before Him. It is said that by His address alif the servant is called in his innermost self to withdraw infirād [his] heart to God most high. At His address lām he is asked to yield līn to Him in considering His due. On hearing the mīm he is asked to conform muwāfaqa to His command regarding that which has been entrusted to him.
ذَلِكَ ٱلْكِتَابُ لاَ رَيْبَ فِيهِ هُدًى لِّلْمُتَّقِينَ,That Book in it there is no doubt It is said that that Book means “this Book.” It is said that [that Book] is an allusion to that which preceded its revela- tion in the [divine] speech. It is said [that it means] “that Book whose revelation I promised to you on the Day of the Covenant.” In it there is no doubt for this is the time of its revelation. It is said “that Book within which I prescribed mercy on Myself for your commu- nity-there is no uncertainty [regarding that] for it has been verified by what I have said.” It is said that “[that Book is] the Book that is My predetermination sābiq ḥukmī and My eternal decree qadīm qaḌāÌī because in it there is no doubt regarding those for whom I have ruled happiness or those whom I have sealed with wretchedness.” It is said that [it means] “My determination ḥukm is what I have said: without doubt My mercy precedes My wrath.” It is said that [it is] an allusion to the faith knowledge love and good- ness that is written in the hearts of His friends. Surely the Book of the lovers is something cherished by the lovers especially when deprived of meeting. In the Book of the lovers [they find] their consolation and intimacy their healing and refreshment. With respect to this they recite: Your writing is all around me it does not leave my bed. There is healing in it for that which I conceal. They also recite: The book brought what is most cooling to our eyes a healing for hearts; thereby the utmost limits of desires are granted. People divided happiness into portions among themselves. The most fortunate of them was I. A guidance for the God-fearing That is [it is] an explanation and proof a light and a highway for those whom the Real سبحانه وتعالى has protected from the darknesses of ignorance and given insight with the lights of the intellect and selected for the realities of connecting waṣl. For the friends awliyāÌ this Book is a healing shifāÌ and for the enemies aʿdāÌ [it is] blindness and affliction balāÌ. The one who is God-fearing muttaqin is one who fears ittaqā looking to his own fear of God taqwā; he does not rely on it nor does he consider that he can be saved except through the grace of his Protector.
ٱلَّذِينَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱلْغَيْبِ وَيُقِيمُونَ ٱلصَّلٰوةَ وَممَّا رَزَقْنَاهُمْ يُنْفِقُونَ,Who believe in the unseen and maintain the prayer The true meaning of belief īmān is affirmation taṣdīq and then actu- alization taḥqīq both of which are brought about by God's granting of success tawfīq. The affirmation is in the pledge ʿaqd and actualization is through the exertion of effort jahd in preserving the pact ʿahd and observing the limit ḥadd. The believers are those who affirm ṣaddaqū their commitment iʿtiqād and then are sincere ṣadaqū in their effort ijtihād. As for the unseen what the servant knows of it is limited to what is necessary. The servant understands each religious matter by a kind of reasoning istidlāl a mode of mental examination fikr and calling forth of evidence istishhād. So the belief is invisible ghaybī within it. The Lord سبحانه وتعالى is unseen ghayb and what the Real speaks about with regard to the gathering and the resurrection the reward and the place of return and the reckoning and punishment is unseen. It is said that only someone who has the lamp of the unseen with him believes. Those who are supported by the demonstrative proof of intellects burhān al-ʿuqūl believe through the corroboration of knowledge dalālat al-ʿilm and what points to certainty ishārat al-yaqīn. The veracity of rea- soning ṣidqu al-istidlāl brings them to the courtyards of seeking insight istibṣār and what is correct in the evidence they call forth istishhād carries them to the elevated observation points of stillness. Their faith in the unseen comes through the types of knowledge ʿulūm they possess crowding out the causes of doubt. [Others] receive deeper instruction taʿrīf through curtains of lights He has lowered down over them. Through the glimmers of clear evidence bayān He has freed them from the need for any reflection fikr and vision ruÌya any seeking of pure intuitions khawāṬir zakiyya or rejection of ignoble urgings dawāʿin radiyya. The suns of their innermost selves rise and they no longer have any need for the lamps of their reasoning istidlāl. Regarding this they have recited: From your face my night has become the sun of the bright morning. The darkness in the air is elsewhere. People are in the twilight of darkness. While we from your face are in the bright morning light. They also recite: The sun of the one who loves you has appeared at night.
وٱلَّذِينَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِمَآ أُنْزِلَ إِلَيْكَ وَمَآ أُنْزِلَ مِن قَبْلِكَ وَبِٱلآخِرَةِ هُمْ يُوقِنُونَ,and who believe in what has been revealed to you; and what was revealed before you; and of the hereafter they are certain. Their belief in the unseen necessarily requires their belief in the QurÌān and in what God has revealed in the books before the QurÌān but He repeats the mention of belief here for the purposes of specification takhṣīṣ and cor- roboration taÌyīd. To affirm taṣdīq [Muḥammad's role as] the intermedi- ary ﷺ in some of what he has communicated obligates the affirmation of him in all that he has communicated since the evidence of his sincerity bears witness generally without any restriction. They have certainty in the hereafter because they have witnessed the unseen: When the Messenger of God ﷺ asked ḥāritha “How is your stateḍ” He said “I have become one who submits to God in truth and it is as if I were with the people of the garden exchanging visits and as if I were with the people of the fire clamoring to one another and as if I were with the throne of my Lord in plain sight. The Messenger of God ﷺ said “You have it right so keep to it.” ʿāmir b. ʿAbd al-Qays said “If the veil were to be lifted it would not increase my certainty.” The real meaning of certainty is to rid oneself of indecisive guessing takhmīn and to avoid loose conjecturing ẓunūn.
أُوْلَـٰئِكَ عَلَىٰ هُدًى مِّن رَّبِّهِمْ وَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْمُفْلِحُونَ,Those are upon guidance from their Lord; those are the ones that will prosper It means “[Those are] in possession of clear evidence certainty unveiling and realization from their Lord.” He discloses Himself to their hearts first by His signs then by His attributes and then by His reality and essence. Some people are upon guidance from their Lord by means of rational proofs dalāÌil al-ʿuqūl. They apply [these proofs] properly and therefore attain truths of different types of knowledge ḥaqāÌiq al-ʿulūm. Other people possess insight baṣīra into the courtesies of drawing near so that through witnessing the mercy and generosity [of God] they attain the per- spicuity bayān of certainty. The truth appears to others in their innermost selves so that they witness the reality of the eternally sought and impen- etrable ṣamadiyya and they attain to the source of the faculty of insight by virtue of deeper knowledge ʿirfān. Those are the ones that will prosper: Prosperity is to succeed in one's objective and to win what is sought. He grants the folk subsistence baqāÌ at the place of meeting and they succeed in subduing the enemies that are the clamor of the false notions hawājis of the lower self. Then the thoughts khawāṬir that come to hearts disappear and they stand by the Real for the Real without the intermediary of an intellect ʿaql or recourse to memory dhikr and reflection fikr.
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ سَوَآءٌ عَلَيْهِمْ ءَأَنذَرْتَهُمْ أَمْ لَمْ تُنْذِرْهُمْ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ,As for the disbelievers alike it is for them whether you have warned them or have not warned them they do not believe. Those who are veiled by the covering of their own qualities are kept from witnessing His truth. The allusion here is that both are the same to them- the words of one who tries to lead them to the Real ḥaqq or the words of one who aids them in seeking to attract worldly fortune ḥaẓẓ. Nay they are more inclined to the calls to heedlessness and prefer to pay attention to them. How could they not when they are marked with the branding of separation locked in the prison of absence and barred from the place of nearness. None of them will attain faith īmān because they have no security amān from the Real. Because they have not been granted secu- rity lam yuÌmanū they do not believe lam yuÌminū. A decision ḥukm God has already made is inalterable and a word from Him is final. [God's] power cannot be opposed. Fearsome attacks will surprise those who con- test what has been decreed by the Real and the decision [of the Real] will catch them unaware. It is said that the disbeliever does not desist from his error because of the misery that is already his. Likewise the one who is bound by the shackles of his lower self is veiled from witnessing the unseen and His reality for he cannot see the right way or pursue the right course. It is said that for the one who remains in the darknesses of his foolishness the advice of sound guides and the fictions of those who speak falsely are equal to him for God has removed from his states the blessings of being able to judge between two things. He does not come with an ear to acceptance and pays little attention to the one who calls to right conduct. As it is said: My sincere advice naṣīḥatī is the concern of the sincere naṣūḥ. The disobedience of the sincere is My concern alone. It is also said that whoever has strayed from bearing witness to the favors that have been allotted to him imagines that the matter comes from what he does and does not do. [Such a person] relies on his own actions and is blind to witnessing [God's] gifts fa-ittakala ʿalā aʿmālihi wa-taʿāmā ʿan shuhūd afḌālihi.
خَتَمَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ قُلُوبِهمْ وَعَلَىٰ سَمْعِهِمْ وَعَلَىٰ أَبْصَٰرِهِمْ غِشَاوَةٌ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ عظِيمٌ,God has set a seal on their hearts and on their hearing; and on their eyes is a covering; and for them will be a mighty chastisement. The seal on something prevents anything from entering it or coming out. Similarly the Real سبحانه has determined that the ignorance and error in the hearts of His enemies will not be removed nor will any insight or guidance enter into them. There is a covering of forsakenness over the hearing of their hearts. The faculties of hearing have been blocked from receiving the speech of the Real with respect to belief so the whisperings of Satan and the murmurings hawājis of their lower selves distract [the heart] from listening to the intuitions khawāṬir that come from the Real. As for the elect the intuitions that come from different kinds of knowledge ʿulūm and preoccupation with the results to questions in their hearts-these distract their hearts from the secrets of the Real coming to them without intermediary. That is only for the elect of the elect. For this reason the Messenger of God ﷺ said “There have been inspired men muḥaddathūn in communities and if there is one in my community it is ʿUmar.”This inspired one is singled out from the elect just as the one who possesses different types of knowledge is singled out from among ordinary people. There is a covering over the eyes of outsiders so they will not see either by the “sight” baṣar of different kinds of knowledge or by the inner sight baṣīra of realities. And for them will be a mighty chastisement because of their supposing that they have something and their heedlessness of what they have been given in tribulation in the present fī l-ḥāl and the end wa-l-maÌāl in their separation in the here and now fī l-ʿājili furqatihi and their burning in what is to come wa-fī l-ājil ḥurqatihi.
وَمِنَ ٱلنَّاسِ مَن يَقُولُ آمَنَّا بِٱللَّهِ وَبِٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلآخِرِ وَمَا هُم بِمُؤْمِنِينَ,And some people there are who say “We believe in God and the last day”; but they are not believers. They stayed firm in their hypocrisy and persisted in deceiving the Muslims so God tore off their veils by His saying “but they are not believers.” Thus it is said: Whoever adorns himself with something other than what is in him the test exposes what he is only pretending. When their words were stripped of their meanings the harm they received from them was greater than the benefit they had imagined in them for God most high said Verily the hypocrites will be in the lowest level of the fire [4:145]. If it were not for their hypocrisy their punishment would not have been increased. It is said that when they lacked true sincerity in their states ṣidq al-aḥwāl the correct words ṣidq al-aqwāl were of no benefit to them. God most high said “God bears witness that the hypocrites truly are liars” [63:1] for they used to say “We bear witness that you are indeed the Messenger of God.” In a similar way the one who outwardly declares what he has not yet realized will immediately be exposed before the masters of realization. It has been said: O you who claim love for Sulaymā You have nothing from her not even nail clippings. You are only like a wāw43 in [your] love for her attached in spelling in the wrong place to ʿAmr.
يُخَادِعُونَ ٱللَّهَ وَٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَمَا يَخْدَعُونَ إِلاَّ أَنْفُسَهُم وَمَا يَشْعُرُونَ,They would deceive God and the believers; and they only deceive them- selves; and they are not aware. The harm of their deception and the punishment for it comes back to themselves so it is as if they have deceived themselves in actuality for they devalue and belittle themselves. No one suffered the harm of their actions but themselves-they cut off their own lifeblood. When there is one who knows the true nature of things the one who desires to deceive him only deceives himself. The allusion in this verse is to the one who has forgotten [God's] prior kindness. He says “mine through me from me and I” slandering in his delusion and conjecture [what should be] “Yours through You from You and You.” This delusion is the most difficult of punishments because he sees a mirage sarāb and thinks it is drink sharāb until he comes to it and finds it to be nothing and he finds God there who pays him his account in full [24:39].
فِي قُلُوبِهِم مَّرَضٌ فَزَادَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ مَرَضاً وَلَهُم عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ بِمَا كَانُوا يَكْذِبُونَ,In their hearts is a sickness; and God has increased their sickness; and there awaits them a painful chastisement because they used to lie. In the hearts of the hypocrites is the sickness of making partners [with God] shirk and God increases their sickness in their imagining that they have been saved by deceiving the Muslims. The pain of their grievous punishment will reach them in the end. The allusion pertains to whoever has confused his ultimate objective qaṣd with his worldly concerns ḥaẓẓ and mixed his spiritual desire irāda with his whims hawā taking one step forward with spiritual desire and one step backward with worldly con- cerns and following the lower self. He is neither a sincere seeker murīd nor permanently neglectful. If the hypocrites had been sincere in their beliefs they would have been safe from the punishment in the hereafter just as they were safe from paying the jizya tax and the like in this world in the manner of polytheists and dhimmīs. Similarly if the seeker murīd had been sincere in his spiritual desire he would have reached out in his heart to the realities of the communion [of lovers] and the blessings of sincerity would have reached him and he [would have] attained what he desired. But his state is as it has been said: We have not been firm but justice will be firm with us without bending. If we had been sincere khalaṣnā we would have been saved takhallaṣnā from tribulation. There is a barrier between one whose worship has become weak and the degrees of the gardens darajāt al-jannāt. There is a barrier between one whose spiritual desire has become weak and the intimate communications of nearness and whispered confidences muwāṣalāt al-qurb wa-l-munājāt. As for those who rely on this world and follow [their] whims their reliance on the abode of illusion is an illness of their hearts. The increase in their disease will increase as their greed increases. The more they find something from [this world] the more their greed multiplies for what they have not found hastening the punishment for them. Among [their] immediate punishments are the dissipation of their aims and then the loss of all pleasure in their lives. They are kept by [these punishments] from their Protector mawlā. There will be no enjoyment for them nor rest in what they have preferred when [they] follow their own whims.
وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمْ لاَ تُفْسِدُواْ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ قَالُوۤاْ إِنَّمَا نَحْنُ مُصْلِحُونَ  *  أَلاۤ إِنَّهُمْ هُمُ ٱلْمُفْسِدُونَ وَلَـٰكِن لاَّ يَشْعُرُونَ,When it is said to them “Do not [foment] corruption in the land” they say “We are only putting things right.” Truly they are the agents of corruption but they perceive not. This alludes to the fact that when thoughts of warning came secretly to their hearts calling them to right conduct they followed self-indulgent interpretations rukhaṣ al-taÌwīl and deceived themselves about that which bore witness to the hardness of their hearts. When they denied the proof of the Real in the thoughts that came to their hearts God took the bless- ing away from their states and in its place gave them a deaf ear to the Real. Their affliction is in their resistance to the path Ṭarīqa and their loss of belief in it. Just as an apostate is a more intense enemy to Muslims so the one who returns from spiritual desire irāda to the world and ordinary customs is the worst of people in rejecting this path and the most distant from its followers. As the proverb goes “Anyone who loses their stored grain to fire wishes the same for others.” According to the sincere among those [on the path] the help of those who have deserted the way of spiritual desire should not be accepted just as the Messenger ﷺ did not accept the almsgiving zakāt of Thaʿlaba. It is said that it is sufficient to expose those who lie by saying to such a person's face “You have lied.” When they said “We are only putting things right” the Real سبحانه showed them to be liars and He said “Truly they are the agents of corruption but they perceive not” meaning “We are aware of them and have exposed them.”

وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمْ آمِنُواْ كَمَآ آمَنَ ٱلنَّاسُ قَالُوۤاْ أَنُؤْمِنُ كَمَآ آمَنَ ٱلسُّفَهَآءُ أَلاۤ إِنَّهُمْ هُمُ ٱلسُّفَهَآءُ وَلَـٰكِن لاَّ يَعْلَمُونَ,When it is said to them “Believe as the people believe” they say “Shall we believe as fools believeḍ” Truly they are the foolish ones but they know not. Here the allusion is to the hypocrites who when they were called to the Real described the Muslims as foolish. Similarly when the wealthy are commanded to renounce this world they describe the people of right conduct as lazy and weak. They say the poor fuqarāÌ have nothing because they have no wealth no status no comfort and no livelihood. In truth they [the wealthy] are the poor and they are those who are tested. They fall into ignominy out of fear of ignominy and struggle with abasement out of fear of abasement. They construct castles quṣūr but live in tombs qubūr. They adorn the cradle mahd but are wrapped in the grave lahd. They gallop in the fields of heedlessness ghafla but stumble in the wadis of grief ḥasra. Soon they will come to know but then their knowledge will not benefit them. Nothing will be of use to them. When the dust clears you will see whether a horse or a donkey is beneath you.
وَإِذَا لَقُواْ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ قَالُوۤا آمَنَّا وَإِذَا خَلَوْاْ إِلَىٰ شَيَاطِينِهِمْ قَالُوۤاْ إِنَّا مَعَكُمْ إِنَّمَا نَحْنُ مُسْتَهْزِءُونَ  *  ٱللَّهُ يَسْتَهْزِئُ بِهِمْ وَيَمُدُّهُمْ فِي طُغْيَانِهِمْ يَعْمَهُونَ,When they meet those who believe they say “We believe”; but when they go apart to their devils they say “We are with you; we were only mocking.” God [Himself] mocks them leaving them in their insolence bewildered. The hypocrites wanted to maintain their relations with disbelievers while associating with Muslims so when they appeared before Muslims they said “We are with you” and when they were alone with those like them among the disbelievers they voiced their loyalty to them. They wanted to have relationships with both sides but they were excluded from both. God most high said “Wavering all the time-not to these neither to those” [4:143]. Similarly anyone who wants to combine the path of spiritual desire irāda with [one's habitual behavior] with ordinary people ahl al-ʿāda [should know that] this cannot be done since the two opposites cannot be combined. “The servant who has contracted with his master to be freed is still a servant until the last dirham [is paid].” When night draws nigh day slips away. Anyone who has a hodgepodge khalīṬ in every corner nāḥiyya and a heart bound rabīṬ in every nook zāwiyya is headed for disaster. First one group and then another take turns dwelling in his heart so that it is forever ruined.53 There is no pleasure for him in life nor does he truly possess any provision from his heart. The one who spoke for them said: I see you as someone left over from the people of Moses for they do not wait patiently for food. When the hypocrites said “we were only mocking” God most high said “God [Himself] mocks them” that is He requites them for their mocking. Similarly when people put the reins in the hands of carnal desires they are lured into the wadis of separation. Their feet are not firmly planted in a place so they wander in the labyrinth of absence. Just as he leaves the hypocrites in their insolence bewildered he prolongs the period [in which they dwell with] their confused hopes. So when the times of their deaths draw nigh their hopes are at their highest while their actions are at their lowest. That is the requital for what they did and the noxious result of what they produced. The beautification of their ugly acts in their eyes is the worst of their punishments and their being content with their listlessness is their greatest misfortune.

أُوْلَـٰئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱشْتَرَوُاْ ٱلضَّلَـٰلَةَ بِٱلْهُدَىٰ فَمَا رَبِحَتْ تِّجَارَتُهُمْ وَمَا كَانُواْ مُهْتَدِينَ,Those are they who have bought error for guidance; so their commerce has not profited them; nor are they guided. This alludes to those who have neglected what is due ḥuqūq by remain- ing in the familiar territories of worldly fortunes ḥuẓūẓ. [They] have lost their bargain so their commerce has not profited them. Those who are content with this world over the next are in manifest loss. Those who prefer this world or the next over the Real have the most intense loss. Although the one who suffers the loss of [the gardens] of bliss will come up short the one who is afflicted with distance from intimate conversation and the disengagement of his heart from his Protector the one who remains in the captivity of carnal desires with no messenger [reaching] his heart the one without attainment for his spirit without intimate conversation with Him without approach to Him without the witnessing [of Him] in his innermost self-this is the one who [truly] suffers and is afflicted. If even a moment slips away his Lord has slipped away. Moments have no substitutes or alternates. Thus someone said: You were the pupil of my eye. [The organ] by which I see wept for you. Anyone who has a will after you let him die for I used to be a guard over you.
مَثَلُهُمْ كَمَثَلِ ٱلَّذِي ٱسْتَوْقَدَ نَاراً فَلَمَّآ أَضَآءَتْ مَا حَوْلَهُ ذَهَبَ ٱللَّهُ بِنُورِهِمْ وَتَرَكَهُمْ فِي ظُلُمَٰتٍ لاَّ يُبْصِرُونَ,Their likeness is as the likeness of one who kindled a fire and when it illumined [the area] all about him God took away their light and left them in darkness unable to see The similitude God سبحانه strikes here for hypocrites is that of someone who kindles a fire in the beginning of the night then the fire is extinguished and he is left in the darkness. Similarly something of the benefits of this world appear to the hypocrites outwardly but then they are afflicted in the hereafter by the pain of the punishment. Or [it may be that] something of their affirmation iqrār flashes but then they remain in the darkness of their denial inkār. The allusion in this verse is to one who has a beautiful beginning trav- eling the path of spiritual desire Ṭarīq al-irāda. He toils for a time and endures one difficulty after another. He then returns to this world before having reached the truth and reverts to the darknesses of human nature within him. His stem sprouted but did not bear fruit. His branch blossomed but did not ripen. He hastened the eclipse of listlessness over the moons of His presence. The hand of subjugation rejected him after the tongue of kindness beckoned him. His heart moved away from closeness and his lower self became full of rancor toward the seekers. He is as it is said: When passion settled in and we said we were happy we thought we were secure from growing apart. Division sent its messengers in secret and destroyed what we had brought together in our union. The allusion in this verse also pertains to one who grasps [only] the lowest level of comprehension but makes claims far above what he [knows]. When the ongoing increase he possesses in his states is cut off he remains in the darkness of his claims. There is also [an allusion to] the one who relies on the rubble and glitter of this world. When [his] states become like a well-trodden road helped along by hope and rising expectation death appears as an ambush of the divine ruse. He leaves everything yatruk al-kull but carries the burden forth yaḥmil al-kall.
صُمٌّ بُكْمٌ عُمْيٌ فَهُمْ لاَ يَرْجِعُونَ,deaf dumb blind they shall not return Deaf to hearing the calls of the Real with the ears of their hearts dumb to whispered conversation with the Real with the tongue of their innermost selves blind to witnessing the flow of decreed events with the eyes of their faculties of insight. They shall not return from their persistent shamelessness nor can they be deterred from their wholehearted embrace of errors. It is said deaf to hearing through the Real dumb to speaking through the Real blind to studying creation through the Real. There was no predetermination for them to desist iqlāʿ and no allotment to help them in being deterred irtidāʿ.
أَوْ كَصَيِّبٍ مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ فِيهِ ظُلُمَٰتٌ وَرَعْدٌ وَبَرْقٌ يَجْعَلُونَ أَصَٰبِعَهُمْ فِيۤ آذَانِهِم مِّنَ ٱلصَّوَٰعِقِ حَذَرَ ٱلْمَوْتِ وٱللَّهُ مُحِيطٌ بِٱلْكَٰفِرِينَ,Or as a cloudburst out of the heaven in which is darkness and thunder and lightning-they put their fingers in their ears against the thunderclaps cautious of death; and God encompasses the disbelievers. The meaning of His saying “Or” is that He gives either one of these two similitudes for [the hypocrites]. He compares the QurÌān to rain descend- ing from the heaven and compares the promises and threats in the QurÌān to the thunder and lightning in the rain. He compares their seeking refuge to [the ways they] flee from hearing the QurÌān distance themselves from attentiveness and neglect to try to gain insight to those who put their fingers in their ears against hearing the sounds of thunder. Similarly the allusion is to the heedless when the admonitions of those who admonish reach their ears or the lights of felicity shine on their hearts. If they would desist from their blind heedlessness they would be happy. But they keep each other distracted by false hopes and have resolved upon their corrupt path. They make weak excuses and swear by God “Had we been able we would have gone forth with you” destroying their souls [9:42] and they bring about their destruction by their own hands. Truly when the noble one gives you his love he veils the ugly and brings the beautiful to light. Similarly when the one who is tired wants to break things off he becomes weary of being together and says “That was that.”
يَكَادُ ٱلْبَرْقُ يَخْطَفُ أَبْصَٰرَهُمْ كُلَّمَا أَضَآءَ لَهُمْ مَّشَوْاْ فِيهِ وَإِذَآ أَظْلَمَ عَلَيْهِمْ قَامُواْ وَلَوْ شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ لَذَهَبَ بِسَمْعِهِمْ وَأَبْصَٰرِهِمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,The lightning well-nigh snatches away their sight; whensoever it gives them light they walk in it; and when the darkness is over them; they stop; had God willed He would have taken away their hearing and sight; Truly God has power over all things. Part of the similitude of the hypocrites-as also the heedless-is that when they are present at public sermons or their hearts incline to gentleness or some terror overwhelms them their states move closer to repentance and their longing to turn [to God] becomes stronger. But when they revert to their own planning and seek counsel from those close to them their fam- ily and offspring urge them to return to their world. They offer their advice frightening them with weakness and dependency so that their resolve becomes weak their spiritual desire irāda declines and they become as it is said: Whenever he repents he returns to his ignorance just as the one who is feeble suffers a relapse. He said “had God willed He would have taken away their hearing and sight” meaning the outward hearing and seeing of the hypocrites as well as their being deaf and blind inwardly. The same [is true] for the heedless and those who are content with the external aspects of Islam-God most high has the power to negate the positive outcome tawfīq of their practice of outward acts of obedience ẓāhir al-Ṭāʿāt just as He has the power to negate the realization taḥqīq of what they have discovered from the most felicitous states ṣafāÌ al-ḥālāt.
يَٰـأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّاسُ ٱعْبُدُواْ رَبَّكُمُ ٱلَّذِي خَلَقَكُمْ وَٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ,O people worship your Lord who created you and those that were before you so that you may be fearful. Worship ʿibāda is becoming harmonious muwāfaqa with the command and it is pouring all energy into requests for realization taḥqīq of the unseen. The declaration of oneness tawḥīd enters one through the heart disengagement tajrīd [enters] through the innermost self becoming single-minded tafrīd [comes] through intention qaṣd and humility [comes] through the self. Surrender istislām is to the decree ḥukm. It is said “worship Him” by renouncing prohibited things persevering in performing acts of obedience welcoming obligatory acts with humility and lowliness and avoiding detours through the waystations of laziness and indifference. His saying “so that you may be fearful” is to bring the command closer to them and to make it easier. By the word “may” He keeps them at the bounds of fear and hope. The real meaning of “fear of God” taqwā is protecting oneself through conformity [to God's command] from the threats of punishment.
ٱلَّذِي جَعَلَ لَكُمُ ٱلأَرْضَ فِرَٰشاً وَٱلسَّمَاءَ بِنَآءً وَأَنزَلَ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مَآءً فَأَخْرَجَ بِهِ مِنَ ٱلثَّمَرَٰتِ رِزْقاً لَّكُمْ فَلاَ تَجْعَلُواْ للَّهِ أَندَاداً وَأَنْتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ,He who assigned to you the earth for a couch and heaven for an edifice; and sent down from the heaven water wherewith He brought forth fruits for your provision; so set not up compeers to God while you know. He is made known to them by the mention of the favors He has granted in the creation of the heaven for them as a roof raised saqf marjūʿ the establishment of the earth for them as a couch laid out farsh mawḌūʿ and the bringing forth of plants by the rain for them as a provision gathered rizq majmūʿ. It is said that He freed them from any obligation to simula- cra amthāl by eliminating for them any necessary cause ʿilla. So the heaven is sufficient for them as a covering the earth as a bed the permis- sible things as provision obedience as a trade worship as an occupation remembrance as an intimate friend and the Lord as a guardian-so set not up compeers with God and do not attach your hearts to others in seeking what you need. The Real سبحانه وتعالى is One alone in creating there is no originator other than Him. When you imagine anything in events beneficial or harm- ful good or bad as originating from a created thing this is in actuality a kind of idolatry shirk. While you know [refers to the fact] that it is not appropriate to raise the matter of your need with someone who has his own need. The attachment of one in need to another one in need and the reliance of the weak on the weak increases poverty and will not stop harm from taking place.
وَإِن كُنْتُمْ فِي رَيْبٍ مِّمَّا نَزَّلْنَا عَلَىٰ عَبْدِنَا فَأْتُواْ بِسُورَةٍ مِّن مِّثْلِهِ وَٱدْعُواْ شُهَدَآءَكُم مِّن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ صَٰدِقِينَ  *  فَإِن لَّمْ تَفْعَلُواْ وَلَن تَفْعَلُواْ فَٱتَّقُواْ ٱلنَّارَ ٱلَّتِي وَقُودُهَا ٱلنَّاسُ وَٱلْحِجَارَةُ أُعِدَّتْ لِلْكَٰفِرِينَ,And if you are in doubt concerning what We have revealed to Our servant then bring a sūra like it; and call your witnesses besides God if you are truthful. And if you do not and you will not then fear the fire whose fuel is men and stones prepared for disbelievers. He covered the eyes of outsiders so that they did not see His beloved ﷺ and they wandered in the wadis of conjecture because they had lost the light of solicitude. When the Messenger brought signs to them and made miracles appear it only increased their doubts and suspicions. This is the way of those who have turned away from the Real سبحانه. The illumination of proofs only increases their blindness to the truth. God most high said But signs and warners do not avail a folk who will not believe [10:101]. In order to bring them to admit the proof He informed them of their inabil- ity to compete with the miracle He gave them in the QurÌān [a miracle] which was triumphant over humankind from the first to the last. He made them acknowledge that even if they were to make common cause among themselves and strengthen themselves with others like them and exert their utmost efforts and stratagems they would not be able to bring a sūra like any sūra of the QurÌān. He said “If you do not” and then stated that they could not and would not do it for He said “and you will not.” It is as if He said “Look to yourselves and be wary of the idolatry that leads to the punishment of the fire whose fuel is men and stones.” If stones with all their hardness cannot withstand this fire how can men with their weakness bear itḍ When the hearts of the believers became terribly concerned from hearing mention of the fire He strengthened them and said “prepared for disbelievers.” In that is good news for the believers. This is the way of the Real سبحانه. When He causes fear in His enemies he brings glad tidings to His friends. Just as the deception of the disbelievers vanishes when it encounters the miracles of the prophets ḍ similarly the claims of the confused disappear when the lights of the truthful appear. The mark of the one who makes false claims is the return of driving cries rujūʿ al-zajr to the heart. The mark of the one with truthful intent is the occurrence of the [divine] subjuga- tion wuqūʿ al-qahr of the heart. It is a rare individual who can separate and distinguish between [these two types of occurrences in the heart].
وَإِن كُنْتُمْ فِي رَيْبٍ مِّمَّا نَزَّلْنَا عَلَىٰ عَبْدِنَا فَأْتُواْ بِسُورَةٍ مِّن مِّثْلِهِ وَٱدْعُواْ شُهَدَآءَكُم مِّن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ صَٰدِقِينَ  *  فَإِن لَّمْ تَفْعَلُواْ وَلَن تَفْعَلُواْ فَٱتَّقُواْ ٱلنَّارَ ٱلَّتِي وَقُودُهَا ٱلنَّاسُ وَٱلْحِجَارَةُ أُعِدَّتْ لِلْكَٰفِرِينَ,And if you are in doubt concerning what We have revealed to Our servant then bring a sūra like it; and call your witnesses besides God if you are truthful.

In addition to these blessings [the verse] alludes to the glad tidings for the elite-immediate blessings that God has granted to them specifically. That which is to come is the gardens of the reward mathwaba while these are the gardens of nearness qurba. Those [for believers] are the meadows of recreation nuzha while these [for the elite] are the meadows of intimacy zulfa. Those are the gardens of favors afḌāl while these are the gardens of communion wiṣāl. Those are the raising of degrees darajāt while these are the refreshment of intimate conversation munājāt. That is the matter of His generosity jūd while this is independence through His existence wujūd. That is the refreshment of mortal beings abshār while this is the promenade of the innermost selves asrār. That is the kindness of giving to the external forms ẓawāhir while this is the unveiling of the covering from the innermost secrets of hearts sarāÌir. That is the kindness of His gifts and favors wa-tilka luṬfu nawālihi wa-afḌalihi while this is the unveiling of His Beauty and Majesty wa-hadhihi kashfu jamālihi wa-jalālihi. whensoever they are provided with fruits therefrom they shall say "" This is what we were provided with before "" ; they shall be given it in perfect sem- blance; and there for them shall be spouses purified; therein they shall abide. The blessings of the people of the garden will be renewed for them in every moment. They will think that the second [blessings] will be like the first but when they taste it they will find it beyond what came first. Similarly the states of the innermost consciousnesses of the people of realities are forever rising. When one of them has risen from one place he imagines that what he will meet in this [new] breath will be like what came previ- ously. When he tastes it he finds it more than that many times over just as the one who spoke for them said: From your love I kept stopping at a waystation. The bewilderment of the deepest hearts does not stop."
إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لاَ يَسْتَحْى أَن يَضْرِبَ مَثَلاً مَّا بَعُوضَةً فَمَا فَوْقَهَا فَأَمَّا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ فَيَعْلَمُونَ أَنَّهُ ٱلْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّهِمْ وَأَمَّا ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ فَيَقُولُونَ مَاذَآ أَرَادَ ٱللَّهُ بِهَـٰذَا مَثَلاً يُضِلُّ بِهِ كَثِيراً وَيَهْدِي بِهِ كَثِيراً وَمَا يُضِلُّ بِهِ إِلاَّ ٱلْفَٰسِقِينَ,God is not ashamed to strike a similitude even of a gnat or anything above it. For God most high being ashamed would mean the relinquishment tark [of His free agency]. When He describes Himself as being ashamed of something it means He does not do that and when it is said “He is not ashamed” it means He does not mind doing that. Creation in relation to the existence of the Real is in actuality less than a speck of dust in the air habāÌ fī hawāÌ because this is the perishing of one limited thing in another. Therefore the two-the throne and the gnat-are the same in His power. The creation of the throne is not too troublesome or difficult for Him and the creation of the gnat is not too insignificant or easy for him. He سبحانه is too holy to be attached to difficulty or ease. Since the matter can be described in this way He is not ashamed to strike a similitude of the gnat just as He is not ashamed to strike a similitude of the throne and what is below it. It is said that one aspect of the similitude of the gnat is the fact that when it is hungry it becomes strong and flies but once it is satiated it splits open and dies. Similarly Surely mankind goes too far for he thinks himself self-sufficient [96:6-7]. It is said that or anything above it means a [larger] flying insect dhubāb. [Here] one aspect of the allusion is the insolence of the fly in that it keeps returning no matter how much it is driven away. If that [quality] were to be in the lion no human being would be safe from him. But when He created power in the lion He created in him an aversion to humankind. When He created insolence in the fly He created weakness in him calling attention through this to the perfection of His wisdom and the effective- ness of His power. as for the believers they know it is the truth from their Lord; but as for the disbelievers they say “What did God desire by this as a similitudeḍ” As for those for whose eyes of inner consciousness have been opened they do not look to others or to traces or effects āthār unless it is to take heed iʿtibār or to increase the effectiveness of the faculty of insight ibtiṣār.
ٱلَّذِينَ يَنقُضُونَ عَهْدَ ٱللَّهِ مِن بَعْدِ مِيثَٰقِهِ وَيَقْطَعُونَ مَآ أَمَرَ ٱللَّهُ بِهِ أَن يُوصَلَ وَيُفْسِدُونَ فِي ٱلأرْضِ أُولَـۤئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْخَٰسِرُونَ,Those who break the covenant with God after its solemn binding and who cut what God has commanded to be joined; and who do corruption in the land-they shall be the losers. In this the allusion is to the state of one who has traveled the way of spiri- tual desire irāda then returned to what ordinary people have. Although he claimed to be willing to abandon his lower self he proved insincere when things became serious. He gave up allusions to reality ishārāt al-ḥaqīqa for concessions to the sharīʿa rukhaṣ al-sharīʿa. Just as the return of one who travels the way with his [outward] self nafs is not praiseworthy so long as a dirham remains in his bag so the return of one who seeks with his heart qalb is not pleasing so long as a breath nafas remains in his spirit rūḥ: Verily those who have died to the religion of whims find the decree of death a sweet watering place. And who cut what God has commanded to be joined: The cords of the Real are joined through the cutting of the cords with creation. The joining of what belongs to Him is not completed without cutting what belongs to you. When the matter is the reverse it is the opposite. Among that which the servant has been commanded to join is the protection of the sacred relationship of the people of this path. One expends sincere concern to achieve [this joining] rather than offering favors. [The servants' outward] efforts of concern are dedicated mawqūfa to connecting the cords of this path and arranging its conditions while their hearts are directed maṣrūfa in expectation of the guardianship of God most high for His people. The corruption of this path in the land [happens] when [elders on the path] do not pay attention to the small details of the affairs [of those less advanced on the path]. They make themselves too busy to guide an aspirant murīd with their words and too busy to sharpen the aim of a seeker qāṣid with their concerned efforts. This is some of what they neglect that displeases the Real سبحانه. Part of breaching the covenant [happens] when your innermost self turns away from witnessing Him for even a moment. Part of the cutting off of what you have been commanded to join [takes place] when even a breath appears of your worldly concerns at any moment [causing you to not] uphold His right. Part of your corruption in the land is any hour which passes you in which you do not see Him. Surely that is the manifest loss the grave trial and the vast calamity.
كَيْفَ تَكْفُرُونَ بِٱللَّهِ وَكُنْتُمْ أَمْوَٰتاً فَأَحْيَٰكُمْ ثُمَّ يُمِيتُكُمْ ثُمَّ يُحْيِيكُمْ ثُمَّ إِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ,How do you disbelieve in God when you were dead and He gave you life; then He shall make you dead then He shall give you life then to Him you shall be returned! These are words to provoke astonishment and gravity in the servant-with the signs that have been made clear his heart should not incline to disbelief. It is said that He makes Himself known to creation by the glimmers of His proofs and the flashes of His signs. He said When you were dead meaning a drop of sperm its parts all the same and He gave you life as a human being with some of the parts of the sperm designated to be bone some parts flesh some parts hair and some parts skin etc. Then He shall make you dead in making you bones and fragments then He shall give you life in raising you up after you were dead then to Him you shall be returned meaning to whatever He previously determined [for you] in happiness or misery. You were dead through your ignorance of Us and He gave you life in your knowledge of Us then He shall make you dead to what you have witnessed then He shall give you life through Him in taking you from yourselves then to Him you shall be returned meaning [returned] to pre- serving the precepts of the law and carrying out what is due. It is said you were dead because your lower selves remained and He gave you life through the annihilation of your lower selves then He shall make you dead from witnessing [this annihilation] so that you will not pay heed to it and corrupt yourselves. Then He shall give you life by taking you from yourselves then to Him you shall be returned by your being turned about in His grasp سبحانه وتعالى. It is said that He holds their states in check so that there is no perpetual life and no complete annihilation. The more they say “this is life”-while they are thus-the more He turns them and annihilates them. Whenever they become annihilated He affirms them and gives them subsistence so they are forever between negation and affirmation between subsistence and annihilation and between wakefulness and erasure. His way is like this with them.
هُوَ ٱلَّذِي خَلَقَ لَكُمْ مَّا فِي ٱلأَرْضِ جَمِيعاً ثُمَّ ٱسْتَوَىٰ إِلَى ٱلسَّمَآءِ فَسَوَّٰهُنَّ سَبْعَ سَمَٰوَٰتٍ وَهُوَ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عَلِيمٌ,He it is who created for you all that is in the earth; He made all created things subject to [human beings] meaning that they obtain benefit from [created things] in everything: [human beings] dwell on the earth live under the sky are guided by the stars and benefit in one way or another from every created thing. Furthermore [if human beings] were to reflect upon any perceived thing or effect ʿayn wa-athar they would recognize the perfection of His power and the appearance of His lordship in [that thing or effect]. It is said that He has paved the way of knowing for them and awakened them to the ways of beautiful behavior. Moreover He taught them the most sublime aspiration inasmuch as He claimed their works and states for Himself alone for He said Do not prostrate to the sun and moon [41:37]. then He turned istawā to heaven and leveled the seven heavens and He has knowledge of all things. The things that have been brought into existence akwān are laid out in a uniform way istawat by His power; it is not that the Real سبحانه in His Essence sat Himself down istawā on any created thing. How could that be! Unicity aḥadiyya and Self-Sufficiency ṣamadiyya are His real- ity. What some have imagined regarding the possibility of Him being in a specific place is absurd since one “sits” in a place but the Real سبحانه in His Essence does not sit in any place.
وَإِذْ قَالَ رَبُّكَ لِلْمَلَٰئِكَةِ إِنِّي جَاعِلٌ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ خَلِيفَةً قَالُواْ أَتَجْعَلُ فِيهَا مَن يُفْسِدُ فِيهَا وَيَسْفِكُ ٱلدِّمَآءَ وَنَحْنُ نُسَبِّحُ بِحَمْدِكَ وَنُقَدِّسُ لَكَ قَالَ إِنِّيۤ أَعْلَمُ مَا لاَ تَعْلَمُونَ,And when your Lord said to the angels “I am appointing on earth a viceregent” they said “What will You appoint therein one who will do cor- ruption therein and shed blood while we glorify You with praise and sanctify Youḍ”; He said “Assuredly I know what you know not.” This is the beginning of the disclosure of His secret regarding Adam and his progeny. He commanded that clay be extracted from every patch of ground and then commanded that it be left to ferment for forty mornings. Every one of the angels was full of amazement: “What is the property ḥukm of this clayḍ” When He assembled [Adam's] form they had never seen anything like it in marvelous craftsmanship and astonishing wisdom. So when He said “I am appointing on earth... ” conjectures were thrown about hearts were scattered and accusations were made. It was just as [the poet] said: How often I have seen someone beautiful but among mortals my choice has fallen upon you. It is said that God سبحانه وتعالى created all the things He created but did not say about any of them what He said about Adam when He said “I am appoint- ing on earth a viceregent.” The external sense of these words resembles mutual consultation if it were to be [part of a conversation] among cre- ated beings. The Real سبحانه وتعالى created the gardens with what is in them and the throne with what it has in well-ordered parts and perfect forms but He did not say “I am creating a throne or a garden or an angel.” Yet He said of Adam “I am appointing on earth a viceregent” as a way of conferring honor and distinction. The words of the angels “What will You appoint therein one who will do corruption thereinḍ” were not an objection to the divine decree but rather a way of seeking to understand it. To interpret the expression in such a way as to absolve the angels of any blame is more fitting since they are sinless. God most high said [in reference to the angels that they are those] Who do not disobey God in what He commands them [66:6]. Others have said that in this speech the Real سبحانه revealed the hidden haughtiness of [the angels'] obedience and the attention they paid to their own acts in their hearts.
وَعَلَّمَ ءَادَمَ ٱلأَسْمَآءَ كُلَّهَا ثُمَّ عَرَضَهُمْ عَلَى ٱلْمَلَٰئِكَةِ فَقَالَ أَنْبِئُونِي بِأَسْمَآءِ هَـٰؤُلاۤءِ إِن كُنْتُمْ صَٰدِقِينَ,And He taught Adam the names all of them; then He presented them to the angels and said “Now tell Me the names of these if you speak truly.” The general expression ʿumūm in His saying names necessarily implies comprehensiveness while the connection of this word to all of them indicates all-inclusiveness and verification [of the meaning of each]. Just as He taught [Adam] the names of created things-all of them according to what is articulated in the tafsīr of Ibn ʿAbbās and others-He also taught him the names of the Real سبحانه. But He only disclosed to [the angels] the locus He chose for knowledge of the names of created things and by that [disclosure] the measure of [Adam's] superiority over them. As for [Adam's] uniqueness in knowing His names سبحانه that was a secret of which no angel who is near malak muqarrab was aware. One who does not have a rank equal to Adam in knowing the names of created things-what hope could there be in his approaching the names of the Real and grasping the secrets of the unseenḍ Since being selected to know the names of created things makes it proper for the angels to prostrate before him what is one to think about being selected to know the names of the Real سبحانهḍ What is owed to one who is honored with thatḍ It is said that the special status of the angels is in [their] glorification and sanctification [of God]. These acts of obedience are appropriate for created beings for surely obedience is the mark of servants and servants alone. [On the other hand] knowledge in general is a kind of commenda- tion madḥ that is absolutely necessary in describing the Real سبحانه one that is not appropriate for anything other than Him. Among the category of created beings there is no one more perfect in honoring Him than the one who honors Him through His own explanation of His attributes. It is said that He honored [Adam] privately with what He taught him and then explained His selection of him and His giving him precedence on the day of the public revealing [of Adam to the angels]. It is said [that in the words] then He presented them the [word] “then” thumma is a particle of extension or delay.
قَالُواْ سُبْحَٰنَكَ لاَ عِلْمَ لَنَآ إِلاَّ مَا عَلَّمْتَنَآ إِنَّكَ أَنْتَ ٱلْعَلِيمُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ,They said “Glory be to You! We know not except what You have taught us. Surely You are the Knower Wise.” [The angels] offered praise before they made their apology and declared the truth of His judgment over any objection they might have. It means “We have no knowledge of that which You have asked us about and there is no blame that can be directed to You for charging those who are incapable with something You know they cannot do. Surely You are the Knower Wise that is what You do is true and sincere there is none who can pass judgment over You and there is no foolishness nor ugliness from You.”
قَالَ يَآءَادَمُ أَنبِئْهُمْ بِأَسْمَآئِهِمْ فَلَمَّآ أَنْبَأَهُمْ بِأَسْمَآئِهِمْ قَالَ أَلَمْ أَقُلْ لَّكُمْ إِنِيۤ أَعْلَمُ غَيْبَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَأَعْلَمُ مَا تُبْدُونَ وَمَا كُنْتُمْ تَكْتُمُونَ,He said “Adam tell them their names”; And when he had told them their names He said “Did I not tell you that I know the unseen in the heav- ens and the earthḍ And I know what you reveal and what you were hiding.” Among the traces of the divine solicitude to Adam عليه السلام is that when He said to the angels Now tell Me [2:31] they were seized with a fear of speaking especially since He asked that they tell Him something that with their type of knowledge [they] did not comprehend. But because of the information Adam عليه السلام had [God] directed him to inform [the angels] saying “tell them their names” and Adam was not overly fearful of speaking to them. When Adam عليه السلام informed them of the names that they did not know [because of the type of knowledge they had] his merit became apparent to them and He said “Did I not tell you that I know the unseen in the heavens and the earthḍ” meaning “[I know] the different types of knowledge of creation which you do not.” “And I know what you reveal regarding [your] acts of obedience and [what you] hide in believing in [your] superiority over Adam عليه السلام.” When the Real سبحانه wanted to choose Adam He protected him taught him and showed him the effects of his care until [Adam] said what he said [about the names]. When He wanted to execute His decree ḥukm regarding him He caused forgetfulness to enter him so that he forgot His covenant in the presence [of God] and transgressed His limit. God most high said And We made a covenant with Adam before but he forgot and We did not find in him any constancy [20:115]. The moment favored by the [divine] solicitude promoted knowledge and goodness completely while the moment in which the [divine] decree took effect returned him to the state of forgetfulness and disobedience. Thus are the decrees of the Real سبحانه in what they make come and go. The worshiper is made lowly by His decree and He is the doer of what He desires [11:107 85:16]. When they imagined [that they could] obtain preference for themselves by their glorification and sanctification He informed them that the carpet of majesty is too holy to be adorned by the obedience of those who obey or to be defiled by the errors of [those who] stubbornly deny. Their returning to prostration before Adam made manifest [God's] lack of need for the agreement wifāq or opposition khilāf [of created beings].
وَإِذْ قُلْنَا لِلْمَلَٰئِكَةِ ٱسْجُدُواْ لأَدَمَ فَسَجَدُواْ إِلاَّ إِبْلِيسَ أَبَىٰ وَٱسْتَكْبَرَ وَكَانَ مِنَ ٱلْكَٰفِرِينَ,And when We said to the angels “Prostrate yourselves to Adam; so they prostrated themselves except Iblīs who refused and disdained; and so he became one of the disbelievers.” The prostration was not a form of worship ʿibāda to [Adam] in and of himself but rather a way of conforming muwāfaqa to [God's] سبحانه command. It was as if their prostration to Adam was worship of God because it was by His command. It was a way of showing respect to Adam because He commanded them to in order to honor his affair. So it is as if that was a kind of submission khuḌūʿ to [Adam] but one that should not be called worship because the true meaning of worship is the utmost submission nihāyat al-khuḌūʿ and that is not appropriate toward anything but [God] سبحانه. It is said that He explained that His سبحانه sanctity is through His own majesty bi-jalālihi not through their acts lā bi-af ʿālihi even though the adoption of the beautifying [acts] of their sanctification and glorification is credited to them. He who is exalted yajillu is the One who has exalted Himself ajallahu by His own exaltation ijlālihi not by their acts lā bi-af ʿālihi and the One who is mighty yaʿizzu is the One whose power has been made mighty aʿazzahu by His own might iʿzāzihi. His power is exalted beyond the exaltation of created beings jalla ʿan ijlāl al-khalq qudruhu and His mention is magnified beyond the magnification of cre- ated beings ʿazza ʿan iʿzāz al-khalq dhikruhu. His words So they prostrated themselves except Iblīs [means Iblīs] refused in his heart qalb and disdained to prostrate with his self nafs. He was among [those who] disbelieved in [God's] prior determination ḥukm and knowledge ʿilm. In the time period in which Iblīs was emboldened by his obedience he used to strut about in the vest of his conformity [to God's command and decree]. [The angels] acknowledged his superior rank and believed in the worthiness of his distinction. His affair became as [the poet] said: The lamp of communion was shining between us. A wind of separation blew on it and it was extinguished. [Iblīs] used to consider himself deserving of the claim to superiority istījāb al-khayriyya and worthy of nearness and special status istiḥqāq al-takhṣīṣ wa-l-khuṣūṣiyya.
وَقُلْنَا يَآءَادَمُ ٱسْكُنْ أَنْتَ وَزَوْجُكَ ٱلْجَنَّةَ وَكُلاَ مِنْهَا رَغَداً حَيْثُ شِئْتُمَا وَلاَ تَقْرَبَا هَـٰذِهِ ٱلشَّجَرَةَ فَتَكُونَا مِنَ ٱلْظَّٰلِمِينَ,And We said “Adam dwell and your wife in the garden and eat thereof with ease where you desire; but do not come near this tree lest you be evildoers.” [God] settled [Adam] in the garden but with his entry established the tree [by which he was] tested. If not for the prior decree this blossoming tree would have been changed to a withered one its greenery dried out its existence forgotten and Adam's hand would not have reached for its leaves to piece them together [to clothe] himself and what happened to him would not have happened. If this tree had kept growing so that his hand could not reach it all that confusion would not have occurred in his affair but what had been predetermined appeared from the decree. There was no place better than the garden no human being more intelligent than Adam no better counselor than the suggestions of the Real to him. There was nothing unusual lā gharība prior to [Adam's] doing what he did and no resolve lā ʿaẓīma more powerful than his resolve. But divine power cannot be contested and the decree cannot be opposed wa-lakinna al-qudrata lā tukābara wa-l-ḥukma lā yuʿāraḌa. It is said that when He said to him “dwell and your wife in the Garden and eat thereof with ease” [He] was alluding to the fact that it is natural for created beings to dwell comfortably with other created beings and to want to seek worldly things. Alone Adam عليه السلام had nothing but good and freedom from trial but when one like him his spouse came the fangs of sedition anyāb al-fitna appeared and the door to tribulation bāb al-miḥna was opened. When [Adam] dwelled together with Eve he followed her in what she suggested to eat and what happened happened. Indeed it is said: There is an ancient disease in the children of Adam which is the youthful passion of one human being for another. Whenever anything is prohibited to the son of Adam his yearning to approach it increases. Everything was permitted to Adam عليه السلام in the gar- den-only one tree was prohibited. In what has been transmitted about this there is no mention of his hand reaching out toward anything that was permitted to him. [Rather] he lost his patience and plunged into what was prohibited to him-this is the attribute of created beings.
فَأَزَلَّهُمَا ٱلشَّيْطَٰنُ عَنْهَا فَأَخْرَجَهُمَا مِمَّا كَانَا فِيهِ وَقُلْنَا ٱهْبِطُواْ بَعْضُكُمْ لِبَعْضٍ عَدُوٌّ وَلَكُمْ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ مُسْتَقَرٌّ وَمَتَٰعٌ إِلَىٰ حِينٍ,Then Satan caused them to slip therefrom and brought them out of what they were in He caused them to slip azallahumā that is “he made them slip” ḥamalahumā ʿalā l-zalla. In actuality nothing gave them free agency except the divine power and nothing turned them about except the divine decree. He brought them out of what they were in publicly with respect to rank and degree but [secretly] their standing only increased in nobility and worth in the determination of the Real سبحانه. and We said “Go down some of you an enemy to the other” Although He sowed enmity between the two of them and Satan [God] سبحانه was with Adam and sided with him in the victory decreed for them. Satan has little weight to assert his enmity because the power of the Real سبحانه is unassailable. God most high said Truly over My servants you shall have no warrant [15:42]. If Satan were to have authority to seduce others he would have had the possibility of guiding himself. How can that beḍ The unique ability to create every thing is one of the characteristics that describe [God] سبحانه. and in the earth a dwelling shall be yours and enjoyment for a while. The place of assembly and familiarity for corporeal forms ashkāl are the regions of the earth. The place of acquaintance and pasture for the spirits arwāḥ is beyond the throne. The expression “beyond” warāÌ though is a metaphor or hyperbole here. How could aspirations have any connec- tion to eventsḍ How could the ascent of intentions toward realities share a location with anything elseḍ
فَتَلَقَّىٰ ءَادَمُ مِن رَّبِّهِ كَلِمَٰتٍ فَتَابَ عَلَيْهِ إِنَّهُ هُوَ ٱلتَّوَّابُ ٱلرَّحِيمُ,Thereafter Adam received certain words from his Lord and He relented to him; truly He is the Relenting the Merciful. Words flowed from the tongue of Adam in the company of the Real سبحانه and words came from the Real سبحانه to the ears of Adam. They have recited: When we are afraid of the eyes of observers the secrets in the hearts speak. The Real سبحانه spoke in general terms about that [conversation] in order to keep the story veiled or to leave open the possibility of equivocal mean- ing iḥtimāl different opinions ẓunūn and a place for interpretation taÌwīl regarding what it might mean. It is possible that the words of Adam عليه السلام may have been an excuse and justification and the words of the Real سبحانه were by way of acceptance and favor. According to the tafsīr traditions the words of God most high to him were “Are you in flight from Us O Adamḍ” Likewise Adam's words عليه السلام to Him were Our Lord we have wronged ourselves [7:23] and he said “Are You the one evicting me from the gardenḍ” He said “Yes.” Adam said “Will You return me to itḍ” and He said “Yes.” It is said that when He commanded his expulsion from the garden He made a provision zād for him as He told him he would in His exalted speech so that it would be a remembrance and preparation [for his jour- ney] ʿatād: I remember the days of protection then my liver goes weak from fear of being cut off. The conversations of lovers cannot be explained and outsiders will not fully understand them. The decree for the unseen was thus by way of allusion ishāra and not by the meaning provided by commentary tafsīr or inter- pretation taÌwīl. The Real سبحانه wanted this to suggest the state of lovers at the time of separation. In times of farewell it is said “When you leave me do not forget me idhā kharajta min ʿindī fa-lā tansa ʿahdī. If some day you hear little news of me khabarī do not choose another in place of me ghayrī!” And it is also possible to say “If your coming wuṣūluka must elude me at least do not let your emissary rusūluka be delayed.”
قُلْنَا ٱهْبِطُواْ مِنْهَا جَمِيعاً فَإِمَّا يَأْتِيَنَّكُم مِّنِّي هُدًى فَمَن تَبِعَ هُدَايَ فَلاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلاَ هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ,We said “Go down from it all together yet there shall come to you from Me guidance and whoever follows My guidance no fear shall befall them neither shall they grieve.” When one displays bad manners on the carpet one is shown the door. When Adam عليه السلام behaved badly at the fountain of nearness God most high said “Go down some of you an enemy to the other; and in the earth a dwelling shall be yours [2:36]-after you had a place of nearness for dwelling and enjoyment for a while.” They were enjoying ease but in the end they returned to want. They have recited: When they became poor they clung to poverty hoping for a reward. Even when things were easy for them they hastened to return to that state. At the same time that [God] expelled [Adam] from the garden and caused him to descend to the earth He gave him the glad tidings that He would return him to his [former] condition if his heart were inclined to return. He said “Yet there shall come to you from Me guidance and who- ever follows My guidance no fear shall befall them neither shall they grieve.”
وَٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرواْ وَكَذَّبُواْ بِآيَٰتِنَآ أُولَـٰئِكَ أَصْحَٰبُ ٱلنَّارِ هُمْ فِيهَا خَٰلِدُونَ,As for the disbelievers who deny Our signs those shall be the inhabit- ants of the fire abiding therein.” Those who receive favors without gratitude and pay no heed to affirming taṣdīq and recognizing taḥqīq [the truth] will have a painful punish- ment in the end muÌajjal and a separation in the here and now muʿajjal.
يَٰبَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ ٱذْكُرُواْ نِعْمَتِيَ ٱلَّتِي أَنْعَمْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ وَأَوْفُواْ بِعَهْدِيۤ أُوفِ بِعَهْدِكُمْ وَإِيَّٰيَ فَٱرْهَبُونِ,O children of Israel remember My favor wherewith I favored you; The real meaning of “favor” niʿma according to the scholars is unadulter- ated pleasure as well as that which causes [the pleasure]. According to the people of reality favor is what causes you to witness remember or brings you to the One who grants the favor or does not veil you from Him. It can be divided into the favor of mortal beings and external things abshār wa-ẓawāhir and the favor of spirits and the innermost secrets of hearts arwāḥ wa-sarāÌir. The first are types of comforts and the second are modes of witnessings and unveilings. Among the inner favors are the knowledge of hearts and the love of spirits and the witnessings of the innermost hearts. It is said that He commanded the children of Israel to remember the favors and He commanded the community of Muḥammad ﷺ to remem- ber the One who grants them. There is a difference between those who are told remember My favor and those who are told So remember Me I will remember you [2:152]. and fulfill My covenant and I shall fulfill your covenant; and have awe of Me. [For the terms of the covenant] He سبحانه asks for the safekeeping of knowl- edge maʿrifa and we ask for the means to forgiveness maghfira. He asks for the safekeeping of His love maḥābb and we ask for the kindness of His reward thawāb. He asks for presence at the door bāb and we ask for the generous place of return maÌāb. “Fulfill My covenant by safeguarding the secret sirr and I shall fulfill your covenant with beautiful kindness birr.” “Fulfill My covenant which you accepted on the Day of the Solemn Binding mīthāq and I shall fulfill your covenant which I insured for you on the Day of the Encounter talāq.” “Fulfill My covenant by not preferring others ghayrī to Me and I shall fulfill your covenant in not barring you from My kindness and goodness khayrī.” “Fulfill My covenant by caring for the things I entrusted to you wadāÌiʿ and I shall fulfill your covenant in what has been made lasting for you in the splendors of the flashes lawāmiʿ and the gleams of the rising Ṭawāliʿ.” “Fulfill My covenant by safeguarding My secrets asrārī and I shall fulfill your covenant in the beauty of My acts of kindness mabārrī.
وَآمِنُواْ بِمَآ أَنزَلْتُ مُصَدِّقاً لِّمَا مَعَكُمْ وَلاَ تَكُونُوۤاْ أَوَّلَ كَافِرٍ بِهِ وَلاَ تَشْتَرُواْ بِآيَٰتِي ثَمَناً قَلِيلاً وَإِيَّٰيَ فَٱتَّقُونِ,And believe in what I have revealed confirming that which is with you; and be not the first to disbelieve in it. And do not sell My signs for a small price; and fear Me. The allusion is to the fact that the belief of [the servant] is a combination of clear evidence bayān and his belief [that he reaches] through demonstra- tive proof burhān. The generality of believers believe through demon- strative proof based on reasoning istidlāl while the elite of the believers believe through clear evidence by virtue of being drawn near. The Real سبحانه has drawn near to them and so they believe in God. The final states of their belief are through eyewitnessing ʿiyān and that is for the elect of the elect. And be not the first to disbelieve in it: “Do not [be the ones to] introduce disbelief kufr as an ongoing practice sunna” for surely the responsi- bility of the initiator in what he practices is greater than the responsibility of the imitator in what he follows. And do not sell My signs for a small price: “Do not prefer your cheap worldly portion ḥaẓẓ over the grandeur of My truth ḥaqq.” And fear Me: Those who fear His punishment are many but those who are in awe of knowing and seeing Him are rare.
وَلاَ تَلْبِسُواْ ٱلْحَقَّ بِٱلْبَٰطِلِ وَتَكْتُمُواْ ٱلْحَقَّ وَأَنْتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ,And do not obscure the truth with falsehood; and do not conceal the truth while you know. “Do not imagine that the two opposites can be joined for you in harmony or that you can be in one state in two places” [for the servant] is either open-hearted in truth mabsūṬ bi-ḥaqq or tied to worldly concerns marbūṬ bi-ḥaẓẓ. The occurrence of the two situations at the same time is impossible. “And do not obscure the truth with falsehood defiling tadnīs and do not conceal the truth deceiving talbīs while you know that sanctification taqdīs is the right of the True ḥaqq al-ḥaqq.” They have recited: O you who are marrying al-Thurayā to Suhayl by your acknowledgment of the everlasting existence of God how can they meetḍ She is of the northern region when she rises while Suhayl is from the south.
وَأَقِيمُواْ ٱلصَّلٰوةَ وَآتُواْ ٱلزَّكَٰوةَ وَٱرْكَعُواْ مَعَ ٱلرَّٰكِعِينَ,= And establish prayer and pay the alms and bow with those that bow. “Keep in mind the good manners of presence ḥaḌra for the preservation of good manners is the most perfect type of service khidma.” The allusion in giving alms zakāt is to the almsgiving of aspirations just as you fulfill the almsgiving of wealth. The one who spoke for them said: Everything has an almsgiving to be paid. The almsgiving of beauty is a mercy like Mine. Through the abundant increases in aspirations and the subtleties of vision He brings about in those who pursue and seek they are lifted up and their states become states of bewilderment. “And bow with those that bow following the traditions of the pious forefathers salaf in what they used to do avoiding the practice of isola- tion for being in a dense congregation ghumār is sounder than being separated from people.”
أَتَأْمُرُونَ ٱلنَّاسَ بِٱلْبِرِّ وَتَنْسَوْنَ أَنْفُسَكُمْ وَأَنْتُمْ تَتْلُونَ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ أَفَلاَ تَعْقِلُونَ,Will you bid others to piety and forget yourselves while you recite the Bookḍ Do you not understandḍ “Will you rouse others to be foremost while you are content to lag behindḍ” It is also said “Will you call created beings to Us while you hang back from Usḍ Will you give drink to the delegations while you yourselves hold back from the waterḍ Will you vie with others arguing with them over particulars content in your bankruptcy with externalsḍ” It is said “Do you look to the weight of a speck or the measure of a grain in people while you tolerate the mounds of sand and mountains in yourselvesḍ” The one who spoke for them said: Do you look to the mote in my eye when you do not see the beam in your ownḍ It is also said “Do you give the choicest drink while you do not drink in turnḍ” “While you recite the Bookḍ Then you persist obstinately with clandes- tine claims denying the shameful thoughts faḌīḥāt al-khawāṬir and the unmistakable driving cries [to blameworthy things] ṣarīḥāt al-zawājir hidden in your hearts. Do you not understand that these are blameworthy qualities dhamīmun min al-khiṣāl and ugly acts qabīḥun min al-fiʿālḍ”
وَٱسْتَعِينُواْ بِٱلصَّبْرِ وَٱلصَّلَٰوةِ وَإِنَّهَا لَكَبِيرَةٌ إِلاَّ عَلَى ٱلْخَٰشِعِينَ,Seek help in patience and prayer. For it is grievous except to the humble While patience ṣabr weans the lower self from familiar things maÌlūfāt prayer turns one's attention to the pursuit of intimate communications muwāṣalāt. Patience indicates fleeing from anything other [than God] and prayer indicates perpetual standing in the presence of the unseen. Seeking help by these means takes a great deal of rigor unless the Real discloses Himself to one's heart for in the transmitted tradition [it says] “Truly when God most high discloses Himself to something it becomes humble to Him.” When the Real discloses Himself He lightens and makes easy what creatures must take on. This is [true] because assuming responsibility for acts of obedience is a religious obligation taklīf that is a burden whereas the disclosure [of God happens] by witnessings and through realization taḥqīq and ends in communion tamām al-wuṣla and perpetual near- ness dawām al-zulfa. It is said “Seek help through Me for patience with Me and seek help from Me to preserve for you your prayer for Me so that the incoming wāridāt unveilings and awe will not overwhelm you so much that you will be unable to serve [Me].” Surely it is a great blessing from the Real that He decreases the onslaughts of ecstatic finding saṬawāt al-wujūd upon the heart at the time of unveiling; [thus] the servant is able to perform the acts of separation. There are several kinds of patience all of them praiseworthy. There is patience in God patience for God patience through God and patience with God. There is only one type of patience which is not praiseworthy and that is the type of patience which keeps one from God. Patience is beautiful in all abodes except in resisting you for then it is blameworthy.
ٱلَّذِينَ يَظُنُّونَ أَنَّهُم مُّلَـٰقُواْ رَبِّهِمْ وَأَنَّهُمْ إِلَيْهِ رَٰجِعُونَ,who reckon yaẓunnūna that they shall meet their Lord and that to Him they are returning. It is said that the word “to think” ẓann is used here to mean “certainty” yaqīn which would be the most obvious [meaning]. What is meant by it is “reckoning” ḥusbān. Those who reckon with the reckoning of certainty ẓanna ẓann al-yaqīn are those who experience the communion [of lovers]. Those who reckon by the reckoning of guessing ẓanna ẓann al-takhmīn are those who experience separation. [The phrase] they shall meet their Lord mulāqū rabbihim is in a gram- matical form appropriate for the past present and future. Because the folk have recognized the truth of what will be according to the decrees of the unseen they have reached the point that it is as if the promise has already been determined for them and the unseen is present for them.
يَٰبَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ ٱذْكُرُواْ نِعْمَتِي ٱلَّتِيۤ أَنْعَمْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ وَأَنِّي فَضَّلْتُكُمْ عَلَى ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ,children of Israel remember My favor wherewith I favored you and that I have preferred you above all the worlds; He called the children of Israel to bear witness to the favor or bounty faḌl granted to them saying “and that I have preferred you faḌḌaltukum above all the worlds.” He called the Muslims from the community of Muḥammad ﷺ to bear witness to the favor or bounty of God Himself saying “Say: 'In the bounty of God and in His mercy in that let them rejoice'” [10:58]. What a difference between those who bear witness to the favor or bounty they receive and those who bear witness to the bounty of their Lord Himself! The servant's acknowledgment of the favor granted him implies gratitude but with the danger of self-conceit iʿjāb. But the servant's acknowledgment of the bounty of the Real-the One whose majesty is in His description and His beauty in the worthiness of His attribute-involves praise which leads to [God's] approval ījāb.
وَٱتَّقُواْ يَوْماً لاَّ تَجْزِي نَفْسٌ عَن نَّفْسٍ شَيْئاً وَلاَ يُقْبَلُ مِنْهَا شَفَٰعَةٌ وَلاَ يُؤْخَذُ مِنْهَا عَدْلٌ وَلاَ هُمْ يُنْصَرُونَ,and fear the day when no soul for another shall give satisfaction and no intercession shall be accepted from it; nor any compensation ʿadl be taken neither shall they be helped. He causes fear in ordinary people by His acts for He said fear the day and fear the fire [2:24 3:131]. But He causes fear in the elect by His attributes for He said And say: “Act for God will surely see your actions and [so will] His Messenger” [9:105] and He said And you are not occupied with any busi- ness... but We are witnesses over you when you are engaged therein [10:61]. He causes fear in the elect of the elect by Himself for He said God warns you of His Self [3:28 3:30]. [The word] “compensation” ʿadl [here] means “ransom” fidāÌ. On the Day of the Resurrection no intercession will be heard except for the one whom the Real has commanded to intercede for Him. He has permitted it and He in actuality is the greatest intercessor even though the term “intercessor” is not applied to Him because it is without [divine] instruction tawqīf.133 It is said about it: Praise be to God in gratitude for everything good is with Him. The lover has become my intercessor to my intercessor to Him. The intercession of intercessors will not benefit those who have been hit by the calamity of fate. There will be no helpers for them nor ransom accepted from them even if they had the fill of the heavens and earths
وَإِذْ نَجَّيْنَٰكُم مِّنْ آلِ فِرْعَوْنَ يَسُومُونَكُمْ سُوۤءَ ٱلْعَذَابِ يُذَبِّحُونَ أَبْنَآءَكُمْ وَيَسْتَحْيُونَ نِسَآءَكُمْ وَفِي ذَٰلِكُمْ بَلاۤءٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ عَظِيمٌ,And when We delivered you from the folk of Pharaoh who were visiting you with evil chastisement slaughtering your sons and sparing your women; and for you therein was a tremendous trial from your Lord. Whoever has patience in God with the affliction of His enemies aʿdāÌihi God will compensate him with the companionship of His friends awliyāÌihi and He will grant him His beautiful gift ʿaṬāÌihi. The children of Israel were patient in enduring injury from Pharaoh and his people so He appointed prophets from among them and made them kings. He gave them what He had not given anyone in all the worlds. And for you therein was a tremendous trial from your Lord: It is said that [it was] a great blessing niʿmatun ʿaẓīma and a severe trial miḥnatun shadīda. In truth what [came] from God was externally a trial miḥna but it was really for the one who recognized it a blessing niʿma and a kindness minna.
وَإِذْ فَرَقْنَا بِكُمُ ٱلْبَحْرَ فَأَنجَيْنَٰكُمْ وَأَغْرَقْنَا آلَ فِرْعَوْنَ وَأَنْتُمْ تَنظُرُونَ,When We divided for you the sea and We delivered you and drowned Pharaoh's folk while you were beholding. The perceptive faculties baṣāÌir of the children of Israel had become diminished so He showed them miracles openly ʿayānan whereas the perceptive faculties of this community [Muslims] were sharp so He unveiled His signs to them secretly sirran. This is His سبحانه way sunna. For those who are sharper in the perceptive faculty the matter will be more subtle for them and the allusions within it more abundant. [The Prophet] ﷺ said “I was given the all-comprehensive words jawāmiʿ al-kalim and then the speech kalām was shortened for me.” When [the children of Israel] saw these manifest signs in the splitting of the sea and the drowning of the people of Pharaoh they were seized with doubt and said “They did not drown even though they were cast into the sea” but the children of Israel did see them drowning. On the other hand in this community because of their being foremost in their belief in the Messenger of God ﷺ and because of the power of their perceptive faculties one youth said “It is as if I was with the people of the garden exchanging visits and as if I was with the people of the fire clamoring to one another and as if I saw the throne of my Lord in plain sight.” What a difference [there is] between one who sees with his own eyes yet doubts and one who only hears [about something] and yet sees it like an eyewitness because of the power of his belief!
وَإِذْ وَٰعَدْنَا مُوسَىٰ أَرْبَعِينَ لَيْلَةً ثُمَّ ٱتَّخَذْتُمُ ٱلْعِجْلَ مِن بَعْدِهِ وَأَنْتُمْ ظَٰلِمُونَ,And when We appointed for Moses forty nights then you took to your- selves the calf after him and you were evildoers. What a difference [there is] between one community and another! When Moses عليه السلام withdrew from the community for forty days they took the calf as their object of worship and were pleased with that. They said This is your God and the God of Moses but he has forgotten [20:88]. [On the other hand] the community of Muḥammad the Chosen ﷺ spent many years with their prophet. If they had heard anyone mention any form of [material] descrip- tion of what they worshiped they would not have spared their last breath and would have given their lives [before agreeing to such a comparison]. It is said that Moses عليه السلام entrusted his community to his brother saying Take my place with my people [7:142]. When he returned he found that they had fallen into temptation fitna. Our Prophet ﷺ relied on God and did not suggest anyone to lead the community. At the end of his life he said “the highest companions.” See how the Real attended to the care of [Muḥammad's] community in preserving their monotheism. By my life they may forfeit their [territorial] borders but they will not compromise their declaration of God's unity tawḥīd.
ثُمَّ عَفَوْنَا عَنكُم مِّن بَعْدِ ذَلِكَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ,Then We pardoned you after that so that you might be thankful. The quickness [with which God] pardoned such a grave sin indicates the lesser weight of those who were pardoned. The words of God most high testify to that [in addressing the wives of the Prophet] Whoever of you commits manifest indecency the chastisement shall be doubled for her [33:30]. The children of Israel worshiped the calf so God most high said “Then We pardoned you after that.” To the community [of Muḥammad ﷺ] He said “and whoever does an atom's weight of evil shall see it” [99:8].
وَإِذْ آتَيْنَا مُوسَى ٱلْكِتَابَ وَٱلْفُرْقَانَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَهْتَدُونَ,And when We gave to Moses the scripture and the criterion so that you might be guided. The criterion with which this community is distinguished is a light in their hearts by which they differentiate between the truth and falsehood. The Prophet ﷺ said to Wābiṣa “Seek a pronouncement fatwā from your heart.” And he said “Fear the inward perception firāsa of the believer for he sees with the light of God.” And God most high said “If you fear God He will grant you a criterion” [8:29] and that criterion is a legacy for what they have put forward in beautiful works.
وَإِذْ قَالَ مُوسَىٰ لِقَوْمِهِ يَٰقَوْمِ إِنَّكُمْ ظَلَمْتُمْ أَنْفُسَكُمْ بِٱتِّخَاذِكُمُ ٱلْعِجْلَ فَتُوبُوۤاْ إِلَىٰ بَارِئِكُمْ فَٱقْتُلُوۤاْ أَنفُسَكُمْ ذَٰلِكُمْ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ عِنْدَ بَارِئِكُمْ فَتَابَ عَلَيْكُمْ إِنَّهُ هُوَ ٱلتَّوَّابُ ٱلرَّحِيمُ,And when Moses said to his people “My people you have done wrong against yourselves by your taking the [golden] calf; That is “you have not caused harm to anyone but yourselves with the sins you perpetrated.” As for the Real سبحانه He is exalted in description. None of the wrong of the wrongdoers can be referred back to His exaltedness. The calf of whoever acts in conformity with his whim and follows his objects of desire is whatever he is intent upon and whatever he singles out as his objective. now turn to your Creator The allusion is to the true sense of repentance in abandoning oneself entirely to khurūj ilā God. and slay one another; Repentance by slaying oneself has not been abrogated but the slaying [done] by the children of Israel was an outward act while this community's repentance consists of slaying themselves inwardly for the first step in seeking God is to abandon khurūj ʿan the lower self. Verily the people imagined that the repentance of the children of Israel was more difficult but it is not as they imagine for that was the suffering of slaying one time. As for the elect in this community there is a slaying in every moment. Because of this: One who has died and found rest is not really dead. The only real dead are those who are dead among the living. Slaying the soul in truth is declaring it free of strength and power or [to be free] of bearing witness to anything from it. It is rejecting its claim confusing its attempts at self-management submitting all of its affairs to the Real سبحانه stripping it of its free choice and will and obliterating the vestiges āthār of the human from it. As for the remaining traces rusūm and skeletal structures hayākil there is no danger or concern in them. That will be better for you in your Creator's sight; He will turn to you [relenting]; truly He is the Relenting the Merciful. His being for you against yourselves is more perfect than your being for yourselves.
وَإِذْ قُلْتُمْ يَٰمُوسَىٰ لَن نُّؤْمِنَ لَكَ حَتَّىٰ نَرَى ٱللَّهَ جَهْرَةً فَأَخَذَتْكُمُ ٱلصَّٰعِقَةُ وَأَنْتُمْ تَنظُرُونَ,And when you said “O Moses we will not believe you till we see God openly”; and the thunderbolt took you while you were beholding. Demanding to see the Essence without divine blessing is an open act of sacrilege which is one of the signs of distance and misery whereas attest- ing to the attribute of [divine] governance in the unveilings of might as linked to the kindnesses of nearness is one of the marks of communion and the tokens of felicity. Surely when they spoke from ignorance without any sense whatsoever of shame the convulsion and the thunderbolt blast overtook them.
ثُمَّ بَعَثْنَٰكُم مِّن بَعْدِ مَوْتِكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ,Then We raised you up after you were dead so that you might be thankful. He returned them to consciousness after the blows of punishment over- whelmed them in order to fulfill the decree for them and to implement [God's] way of pardoning sin. One of the aspects of generosity is to lower the veil over the defects of servants.
وَظَلَّلْنَا عَلَيْكُمُ ٱلْغَمَامَ وَأَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْكُمُ ٱلْمَنَّ وَٱلسَّلْوَىٰ كُلُواْ مِن طَيِّبَٰتِ مَا رَزَقْنَٱكُمْ وَمَا ظَلَمُونَا وَلَـٰكِن كَانُوۤاْ أَنْفُسَهُمْ يَظْلِمُونَ,And We made the cloud overshadow you; and We sent down upon you manna and quails: “Eat of the good things We have provided for you”; And they did not wrong Us but they wronged themselves. When He banished them to the desolate regions of exile He desired only to shade them ẓallalahum and to cover them jallalahum with sufficient clothing. He freed them aghnāhum from the trouble of having to work for themselves favoring them by providing them tawallāhum with what they needed. Their hair and nails did not continue growing their clothes did not become dirty and the rays of the sun did not beat down on them. This is His way with someone when He has come between him and his free choice. What He سبحانه chooses for him will be better for him than what he chooses for himself.
وَإِذْ قُلْنَا ٱدْخُلُواْ هَـٰذِهِ ٱلْقَرْيَةَ فَكُلُواْ مِنْهَا حَيْثُ شِئْتُمْ رَغَداً وَٱدْخُلُواْ ٱلْبَابَ سُجَّداً وَقُولُواْ حِطَّةٌ نَّغْفِرْ لَكُمْ خَطَٰيَٰكُمْ وَسَنَزِيدُ ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,And when We said “Enter this city and eat freely therein wherever you will and enter it at the gate prostrating and say “exoneration” and We shall forgive you your transgressions and We shall give more to those who are virtuous.” The children of Israel persisted in neglecting that which they were com- manded to do to the point that they were entrusted to preserve [their] speech but they altered it and they were commanded [to take] a position of prostration upon entering [the city] but they did not. They exposed themselves to the arrows of the unseen and then were not able to with- stand the injury of their strikes lam yuṬīqū l-iṣābata bi-qarʿihā. They were exposed to unexpected punishments and could not hold up to the blows of their impact fa-lam yathbutū ʿinda ṣadamāt waqʿihā.
فَبَدَّلَ ٱلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ قَوْلاً غَيْرَ ٱلَّذِي قِيلَ لَهُمْ فَأَنزَلْنَا عَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ رِجْزاً مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ بِمَا كَانُواْ يَفْسُقُونَ,Then the evildoers substituted a saying other than that which had been said to them; so We sent down upon the evildoers wrath from the heaven for their wickedness. They could neither ward off the opening of heaven above them with their stratagems nor avert the cords of affliction below them by relying on their usual states. They gnashed the teeth of remorse when the fangs of pain bit them. How could this have benefited them when the situation was hopelessḍ
وَإِذِ ٱسْتَسْقَىٰ مُوسَىٰ لِقَوْمِهِ فَقُلْنَا ٱضْرِب بِّعَصَاكَ ٱلْحَجَرَ فَٱنفَجَرَتْ مِنْهُ ٱثْنَتَا عَشْرَةَ عَيْناً قَدْ عَلِمَ كُلُّ أُنَاسٍ مَّشْرَبَهُمْ كُلُواْ وَٱشْرَبُواْ مِن رِّزْقِ ٱللَّهِ وَلاَ تَعْثَوْاْ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ مُفْسِدِينَ,And when Moses sought water for his people We said “Strike the rock with your staff” and there exploded from it twelve fountains and each people came to know their drinking place “Eat and drink of that which God has provided and do not be degenerate in the earth seeking corruption.” One who is capable of extracting water from solid rock is capable of quenching thirst without water. But He made the trace or effect athar of the miracle manifest in [Moses] and connected him to the locus maḥall of calling for help. This in order for Moses to work with his self nafs in mov- ing the stone and give him responsibility in striking it with his staff. Thus there would be a measure of [human] effort involved in making His decree come to pass when he sought water for his people. Then the Real سبحانه wanted each people to follow a way sunna stick to their boundary ḥadd and not dispute with their companions. He singled out for each tribe a marker by which they would know their drinking place so that they would not go to each others' drinking places. When He had met their needs He bid them to be grateful to preserve the command and to stop choosing sin and so He said “and do not be degenerate in the earth seeking corruption.” The drinking places are different and each comes to their own so one drinking place is sweet and fresh another salty and bitter another clear and pure and another dried up with only a few drops. The water carrier for each people leads them and the scout of each party drives them on so the lower selves come to the watering places of desires and cravings the hearts come to the drinking places of piety and acts of obedience the spirits come to the watering places of unveiling and witnessing and the innermost selves come to the watering places of realities. The latter [innermost selves] are snatched from the being and outward markings al-kawn wa-l-marsūmāt [of humans] then from the sensory awareness and attributes al-iḥsās wa-l-ṣifāt [of humans] then annihilated in the reality of ecstatic finding and essence al-wujūd wa-l-dhāt.
وَإِذْ قُلْتُمْ يَٰمُوسَىٰ لَن نَّصْبِرَ عَلَىٰ طَعَامٍ وَاحِدٍ فَٱدْعُ لَنَا رَبَّكَ يُخْرِجْ لَنَا مِمَّا تُنْبِتُ ٱلأَرْضُ مِن بَقْلِهَا وَقِثَّآئِهَا وَفُومِهَا وَعَدَسِهَا وَبَصَلِهَا قَالَ أَتَسْتَبْدِلُونَ ٱلَّذِي هُوَ أَدْنَىٰ بِٱلَّذِي هُوَ خَيْرٌ ٱهْبِطُواْ مِصْراً فَإِنَّ لَكُمْ مَّا سَأَلْتُمْ وَضُرِبَتْ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلذِّلَّةُ وَٱلْمَسْكَنَةُ وَبَآءُو بِغَضَبٍ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ ذَلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ يَكْفُرُونَ بِآيَاتِ ٱللَّهِ وَيَقْتُلُونَ ٱلنَّبِيِّينَ بِغَيْرِ ٱلْحَقِّ ذٰلِكَ بِمَا عَصَواْ وَّكَانُواْ يَعْتَدُونَ,And when you said “Moses we will not endure one sort of food; pray to your Lord for us that He may bring forth for us of what the earth pro- duces-green herbs cucumbers garlic lentils onions”; He said “Would you exchange what is better with what is lowlierḍ” “Go down to a city you shall have what you demanded”; And abasement and wretchedness were cast upon them and they incurred God's wrath; that was because they used to disbe- lieve the signs of God and slay prophets without right; that was because they disobeyed and they were transgressors. They were not content with the goodness of [God] choosing for them nor were they patient in His managing what He desired for them in basic food and clothing. In their confusion they fell back to their customary behavior of eating impure food and finding contentment in a lower state so He returned them to the suffering of ignominy muqāsāt al-hawān and bound them to perpetual disappointment idāmat al-khidhlān. They went so far as to shed the blood of prophets and violated the sanctity of [God's] command with their lack of shame. They did not repent so He punished them for their ugly acts qabīḥ fiʿālihim and returned them to what He had chosen for their souls in their contemptible states khasāÌis aḥwālihim. When sincere counsel naṣīḥa did not succeed with them retribution and humiliation faḌīḥa overtook them. It is said that the children of Israel were divided in their aspirations and scattered in their objectives. They were not content to have just one food for themselves nor were they satisfied with one object of worship in their religion; [this was true] to the point that they said to Moses عليه السلام when they saw people worshiping idols “O Moses make for us a god just as they have gods” [7:138]. This is the attribute of the masters of separation arbāb al-tafriqa. Patience with the One al-wāḥid is hard. God most high said “And when you mention the Lord alone waḥdahu in the QurÌān they turn their backs in aversion” [17:46].
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَٱلَّذِينَ هَادُواْ وَٱلنَّصَارَىٰ وَٱلصَّابِئِينَ مَنْ آمَنَ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلآخِرِ وَعَمِلَ صَالِحاً فَلَهُمْ أَجْرُهُمْ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ وَلاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلاَ هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ,Surely those who believe and those of the Jews and the Christians and the Sabaeans whoever believes in God and the Last Day and performs righteous deeds-their wage is with their Lord and no fear shall befall them neither shall they grieve. The diversity of [religious] paths in spite of the unity of the source does not prevent a goodly acceptance [for all]. For anyone who affirms the Real سبحانه in His signs and believes in what He has said concerning His truth and attributes the dissimilarity of [religious] laws and diversity that occurs in [the] name[s] [of religion] is not a problem in terms of who merits [God's] good pleasure. Because of that He said “Surely those who believe and those of the Jews.” Then He said “whoever believes” meaning if they fear [God] in [their] different ways of knowing [Him] all of them will have a beautiful place of return and an ample reward. The believer muÌmin is anyone in the protection amān of the Real سبحانه. For anyone who is in His protection it is fitting that no fear shall befall them neither shall they grieve.
وَإِذْ أَخَذْنَا مِيثَاقَكُمْ وَرَفَعْنَا فَوْقَكُمُ ٱلطُّورَ خُذُواْ مَآ ءَاتَيْنَٰكُم بِقُوَّةٍ وَٱذْكُرُواْ مَا فِيهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ  *  ثُمَّ تَوَلَّيْتُمْ مِّن بَعْدِ ذٰلِكَ فَلَوْلاَ فَضْلُ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ وَرَحْمَتُهُ لَكُنْتُم مِّنَ ٱلْخَاسِرِينَ,And when We made a covenant for you and We raised above you the mount “Take forcefully what We have given you and remember what is in it so that you might preserve yourselves.” Then you turned away thereafter and but for God's bounty and His mercy toward you you would have been among the losers. He سبحانه made a covenant with all responsible beings and some responded willingly because He made Himself known to them and they declared His unity fa-waḥḥadūhu. Other people responded unwill- ingly because He veiled them so they did not want to recognize Him fa-jaḥadūhu. There is no proof more powerful than the eyewitnessing of the mount Ṭūr He raised above them which was a mountain jabal but they lacked the light of inner sight baṣīra and so the witnessing of physical vision baṣar did not benefit them. Then you turned away thereafter that is you returned to disobedience after witnessing the signs with your own eyes. If not for His decree in grant- ing respite and His forbearance through acts of grace He would punish you without delay and cause a great misfortune to descend upon you and your deeds would be entirely a loss.

وَلَقَدْ عَلِمْتُمُ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱعْتَدَواْ مِنْكُمْ فِي ٱلسَّبْتِ فَقُلْنَا لَهُمْ كُونُواْ قِرَدَةً خَاسِئِينَ,And verily you know that there were those among you who transgressed the Sabbath and We said to them “Be apes despised!” The metamorphosis maskh of this community occurred in their hearts. When [the children of Israel] abandoned [God's] command and disdained the laws that were imposed on them the punishments came quickly in their disgrace metamorphosis and in the other things which are included in the [QurÌānic text]. Because of their violation of the covenant and rejection of the limit [imposed by God] the community was punished through the metamorphosis of their hearts and the alteration of their states. [God] most high said “And We shall confound their hearts and their eyes; just as they did not believe the first time” [6:110]. The punishments of hearts are far worse than the punishments of the bodily selves. About this they have recited: O you who ask me “How have you been after himḍ” I suffered that which tormented me while it made him happy. I kept strutting about in our togetherness and felt safe from the ruses of time. But the turning away from me went on until not a bit of what I had experienced remained.
فَجَعَلْنَاهَا نَكَالاً لِّمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيْهَا وَمَا خَلْفَهَا وَمَوْعِظَةً لِّلْمُتَّقِينَ,And We made it an exemplary punishment for all the former times and for the latter and an admonition to those who fear. Thus the states of those who were tried by abandonment muniya bi-l- hijrān and branded with disappointment wusima bi-l-khidhlān became a lesson-to look at what happened to them is to choke on grief. The one who is reduced to misery after having had status becomes an object of scorn before every ignoble person. This is what remains for those who have been brought low after [experiencing] the wrath of kings and [being] shunned by chieftains: The youths surrounded and ganged up on me. From behind they called the dogs on me.
وَإِذْ قَالَ مُوسَىٰ لِقَوْمِهِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَأْمُرُكُمْ أَنْ تَذْبَحُواْ بَقَرَةً قَالُوۤاْ أَتَتَّخِذُنَا هُزُواً قَالَ أَعُوذُ بِٱللَّهِ أَنْ أَكُونَ مِنَ ٱلْجَاهِلِينَ  *  قَالُواْ ٱدْعُ لَنَا رَبَّكَ يُبَيِّن لَّنَا مَا هِيَ قَالَ إِنَّهُ يَقُولُ إِنَّهَا بَقَرَةٌ لاَّ فَارِضٌ وَلاَ بِكْرٌ عَوَانٌ بَيْنَ ذٰلِكَ فَٱفْعَلُواْ مَا تُؤْمَرونَ,And when Moses said to his people “God commands you to sacrifice a cow.” It was obligatory for them to execute the command directly but they wasted time with external appearances imagining that they had the leisure to linger in their digression from the obligation of the covenant. So their misery was doubled and the ignominy they had been warned about overtook them. When He said: “She is a cow neither old nor virgin middling between the two... ” [2:68] it meant she would be neither young nor aged but some- where between the two. The allusion is to the fact that one who is suited for this path Ṭarīqa is one who is neither attracted by the impetuosity of youth and its drunkenness nor paralyzed by the weakness and frailty of old age. Rather he is alert; he has regained consciousness from his drunkenness yet retains some of the vigor of his youth.

قَالُواْ ٱدْعُ لَنَا رَبَّكَ يُبَيِّن لَّنَا مَا لَوْنُهَا قَالَ إِنَّهُ يَقُولُ إِنَّهَا بَقَرَةٌ صَفْرَآءُ فَاقِـعٌ لَّوْنُهَا تَسُرُّ ٱلنَّاظِرِينَ  *  قَالُواْ ٱدْعُ لَنَا رَبَّكَ يُبَيِّن لَّنَا مَا هِيَ إِنَّ ٱلبَقَرَ تَشَابَهَ عَلَيْنَا وَإِنَّآ إِن شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ لَمُهْتَدُونَ,“... a golden cow bright in color gladdening to beholders.” They said “Pray to your Lord for us that He make clear to us what she may be; the cows are all alike to us; and if God wills we shall then be guided.” Just as her [bright] color would have been perceived by the eyes the allu- sion here is to those of the people of the story ahl al-qiṣṣa whose witnessing overwhelms the hearts [of others] because of that which is clothed with the garment of invincibility jabarūt and made to rise from the witness of the unseen. One notices that someone like this is oblivious to human states and is overtaken by the remembrance of the Real. Thus in the transmitted tradition: The friends of God are those who when they are seen God is remembered.
قَالُواْ ٱدْعُ لَنَا رَبَّكَ يُبَيِّن لَّنَا مَا لَوْنُهَا قَالَ إِنَّهُ يَقُولُ إِنَّهَا بَقَرَةٌ صَفْرَآءُ فَاقِـعٌ لَّوْنُهَا تَسُرُّ ٱلنَّاظِرِينَ  *  قَالُواْ ٱدْعُ لَنَا رَبَّكَ يُبَيِّن لَّنَا مَا هِيَ إِنَّ ٱلبَقَرَ تَشَابَهَ عَلَيْنَا وَإِنَّآ إِن شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ لَمُهْتَدُونَ,“... a golden cow bright in color gladdening to beholders.” They said “Pray to your Lord for us that He make clear to us what she may be; the cows are all alike to us; and if God wills we shall then be guided.” Just as her [bright] color would have been perceived by the eyes the allu- sion here is to those of the people of the story ahl al-qiṣṣa whose witnessing overwhelms the hearts [of others] because of that which is clothed with the garment of invincibility jabarūt and made to rise from the witness of the unseen. One notices that someone like this is oblivious to human states and is overtaken by the remembrance of the Real.

قَالَ إِنَّهُ يَقُولُ إِنَّهَا بَقَرَةٌ لاَّ ذَلُولٌ تُثِيرُ ٱلأَرْضَ وَلاَ تَسْقِي ٱلْحَرْثَ مُسَلَّمَةٌ لاَّ شِيَةَ فِيهَا قَالُواْ ٱلآنَ جِئْتَ بِٱلْحَقِّ فَذَبَحُوهَا وَمَا كَادُواْ يَفْعَلُونَ,He said “He says she shall be a cow not broken to plow the earth or to water the tillage with no blemish on her.” They said “Now you have brought the truth”; and so they sacrificed her even though they very nearly did not. Just as this cow was not to have been broken in for work nor worn out for the purposes of profits there was to be no color in her inconsistent with the overall grandeur of her color. The allusion in this is to the people of divine friendship walāya who do not exert themselves with anyone or anything other [than God] which is to say that they do not seek to obtain anything through secondary causes and who do not rely in their hearts on external appearances and simulacra. They do not trust in their own choices and contrivance. They are not prey to the claims of desire nor game in the claws of the present world. Carnal desires do not rule them and no human authority controls them. They do not strive at all to obtain what they desire and are not concerned with attaining what they wish for. There is no mark of others upon them nor any sign of [their seeking anything through] secondary causes for they are supported by God annihilated from all else nay effaced as God turns them this way and that. God has conquered their hearts. Just as their object of worship maʿbūd is God so their only aim maqṣūd is God. Just as their aim maqṣūd is God so what they bear witness to mashhūd is God and what they have found mawjūd is God. Nay they are effaced in God and [only] God remains after them. The one who spoke for them recited: If you want me to be pleased and you to be pleased and to take the reins of our life together then look at the world through my eyes and listen with my ears and speak with my tongue. They said “Now you have brought the truth”; and so they sacrificed her even though they very nearly did not. They sought a stratagem for themselves but when their stratagems failed they submitted to the decree and were rid of the difficulties of the demands. If they had done what they were commanded to do [straight away] their misery would not have been doubled.
وَإِذْ قَتَلْتُمْ نَفْساً فَٱدَّارَأْتُمْ فِيهَا وَٱللَّهُ مُخْرِجٌ مَّا كُنْتُمْ تَكْتُمُونَ,And when you killed a living soul and disputed thereon-and God disclosed what you were hiding One who is disloyal is afraid and out of fear that his secret will become manifest relies on concealment deception denial and evasion. His fault ʿawāruhu is inevitably discovered his secrets asrāruhu exposed and the coverings astāruhu fall because of the shame of his action. God most high said “and God disclosed what you were hiding.”
فَقُلْنَا ٱضْرِبُوهُ بِبَعْضِهَا كَذَلِكَ يُحْيِي ٱللَّهُ ٱلْمَوْتَىٰ وَيُرِيكُمْ آيَاتِهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ,so We said “Smite him with part of it”; God brings to life the dead and He shows you His signs so that you might understand. God سبحانه wanted to give life to the dead man so that he could expose his killer through the testimony [of the slain] so He commanded them to kill one of their animals and made it the cause of bringing the slain man to life. The allusion here is to anyone who desires the life of his heart; he will only attain it by sacrificing his lower self since the heart of anyone who sacrifices his lower self through struggle mujāhadāt comes to life by the lights of witnessing mushāhadāt. Likewise when God wants someone's reputation to live forever He causes his reputation in this world to pass into obscurity.
ثُمَّ قَسَتْ قُلُوبُكُمْ مِّن بَعْدِ ذٰلِكَ فَهِيَ كَٱلْحِجَارَةِ أَوْ أَشَدُّ قَسْوَةً وَإِنَّ مِنَ ٱلْحِجَارَةِ لَمَا يَتَفَجَّرُ مِنْهُ ٱلأَنْهَارُ وَإِنَّ مِنْهَا لَمَا يَشَّقَّقُ فَيَخْرُجُ مِنْهُ ٱلْمَآءُ وَإِنَّ مِنْهَا لَمَا يَهْبِطُ مِنْ خَشْيَةِ ٱللَّهِ وَمَا ٱللَّهُ بِغَافِلٍ عَمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ,Then your hearts became hardened thereafter or even yet harder; for there are stones from which rivers come gushing and others split so that water issues from them; and others come down in fear of God; And God is not heedless of what you do. He explained that even though they witnessed weighty signs and had seen clear proofs when [divine] solicitude ʿināya did not help them and God did not decree guidance hidāya for them the many signs only increased their hardness qaswa and brought misery upon misery shaqwa for them from the hiding places of the [divine] preordination. He compared their hearts to stones because [stones] do not grow or thrive and their hearts likewise do not understand and are not aware. Then He explained that [their hearts] are even harder than stones for there are stones from which rivers come gushing and upon which the traces of the fear of God appear. But their hearts are empty of all good. How can it not be so when [their hearts] were made to suffer the turning of the Real from them muniyat bi-iʿrāḌi al-ḥaqqi ʿanhā and were singled out for the removal of all good from them wa-khuṣṣat bi-intizāʿi al-khayrāt minhā.
أَفَتَطْمَعُونَ أَن يُؤْمِنُواْ لَكُمْ وَقَدْ كَانَ فَرِيقٌ مِّنْهُمْ يَسْمَعُونَ كَلاَمَ ٱللَّهِ ثُمَّ يُحَرِّفُونَهُ مِن بَعْدِ مَا عَقَلُوهُ وَهُمْ يَعْلَمُونَ,Are you then so eager that they should believe you seeing there is a party of them that heard God's word and then tampered with it and that after they had comprehended it knowinglyḍ He informed them of [the status] of their belief and related that after hearing the address of God سبحانه they engaged in tampering [with it] and altering [it]: “Why would they believe you when they already heard by means of the messageḍ How can those who do not remain in a state of faith imān after eyewitnessing ʿiyān believe by means of demonstrative proof burhānḍ That which does not hold true for the Real does not hold true for you. How can those who are not ashamed before the Real be ashamed before youḍ”

But they did not know that God was informing His Messenger عليه السلام of their secrets and that a light the Real makes manifest cannot be extinguished by the efforts of anyone other than Him. When the tongue agrees but the mind162 objects it only increases separation.
وَإِذَا لَقُواْ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ قَالُوۤاْ آمَنَّا وَإِذَا خَلاَ بَعْضُهُمْ إِلَىٰ بَعْضٍ قَالُوۤاْ أَتُحَدِّثُونَهُم بِمَا فَتَحَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْكُمْ لِيُحَآجُّوكُم بِهِ عِنْدَ رَبِّكُمْ أَفَلاَ تَعْقِلُونَ  *  أَوَلاَ يَعْلَمُونَ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَعْلَمُ مَا يُسِرُّونَ وَمَا يُعْلِنُونَ,And when they meet those who believe they say “We believe”; but when they go in private one to another they say: “Do you speak to them of what God has disclosed to you so that they may thereby dispute with you before your Lordḍ Have you no understandingḍ” Do they not know that God knows what they keep secret and what they proclaimḍ They encouraged one another among themselves to reject the Real and to hide the situation from the Muslims.

وَمِنْهُمْ أُمِّيُّونَ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ ٱلْكِتَابَ إِلاَّ أَمَانِيَّ وَإِنْ هُمْ إِلاَّ يَظُنُّونَ  *  فَوَيْلٌ لِّلَّذِينَ يَكْتُبُونَ ٱلْكِتَابَ بِأَيْدِيهِمْ ثُمَّ يَقُولُونَ هَـٰذَا مِنْ عِنْدِ ٱللَّهِ لِيَشْتَرُواْ بِهِ ثَمَناً قَلِيلاً فَوَيْلٌ لَّهُمْ مِّمَّا كَتَبَتْ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَوَيْلٌ لَّهُمْ مِّمَّا يَكْسِبُونَ,And there are some of them that are illiterate not knowing the scripture but only desires and mere conjectures. So woe to those who write the scripture with their hands then say “This is from God” that they may sell it for a small price. He related that they differed in the shortcomings of their disbelief. One group is the most contemptible while the majority relied on blind fol- lowing taqlīd out of ignorance. It was not that doubt seized them but rather that they were misled by conjecture and speculation. They have no share in their scriptures other than to recite them without knowledge of their meanings. Among this group are those who are mostly concerned with what they desire for themselves. There is no possibility of their being helped and no definitive way of finding the truth among their conjectures. Then He related the bad outcome for them in His words may His men- tion be exalted: So woe to them for what their hands have written and woe to them for their earnings. It means they have lost in the present and in the end. This verse alludes to those who lack sincerity ikhlāṣ in companionship ṣuḥba165 on the path of the Real. They associate with the friends awliyāÌ [of God] externally but they possess no true spiritual desire irāda so they are companions of the heedless with only a partial view of this path Ṭarīqa. Whenever the clamor of worldly fortunes call they rush to respond will- ingly but when the demands of the Real سبحانه direct them to some endeavor their situation is a bad one since they are not sincere. How intense will be their remorse for what they have hoarded from God! They will not prosper.

وَقَالُواْ لَن تَمَسَّنَا ٱلنَّارُ إِلاَّ أَيَّاماً مَّعْدُودَةً قُلْ أَتَّخَذْتُمْ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ عَهْداً فَلَنْ يُخْلِفَ ٱللَّهُ عَهْدَهُ أَمْ تَقُولُونَ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ مَا لاَ تَعْلَمُونَ,And they say “the fire shall not touch us save a number of days.” Say: “Have you taken a covenant with Godḍ God will not fail in His covenant or say you against God what you do not knowḍ This verse alludes to those whose hearts are filled with false claims. Their conjecture has gotten the better of them for out of extreme foolishness they judge themselves to be among the people of the story ahl al-qiṣṣa. Such a person abides yakhlud with the murmurings of his lower desires. He judges the unseen by what he has himself neglected having forgotten the ugliness of what he has done and remembering [only] the errors of his false thinking. He is a servant of his lower self whose good opinion of himself has gotten the better of him. In reality the results of his neglect and deceit possess him. God most high said “And that supposition of yours which you supposed of your Lord has ruined you. So you have become among the losers” [41:23].
بَلَىٰ مَن كَسَبَ سَيِّئَةً وَأَحَاطَتْ بِهِ خَطِيـۤئَتُهُ فَأُوْلَـۤئِكَ أَصْحَابُ ٱلنَّارِ هُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ,Not so; whoever earns evil and is encompassed by his transgression- those are the inhabitants of the fire therein abiding khālidūn. In the language of scholars168 the one who is encompassed by his trans- gression is the disbeliever. But the allusion in it is to one whose heart has ceased its perpetual calling for help. The possessors of realities are like grain in the frying pan in their moments of wakefulness ṣaḥw. Those [of them] who have become still are thus because of His excessive majesty not because they are listless. Whoever relies on obedience seeks favor from it and thinks that he [can] draw near by means of it but he should keep his distance from this [idea]. Whoever comes to know the truth of God's unity knows that there is no means to Him except through Him.
وَٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ أُولَـٰئِكَ أَصْحَابُ ٱلْجَنَّةِ هُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ,And those who believe and perform righteous deeds-those are the inhabitants of paradise therein abiding. In the here and now there are gardens of communion and in the end [there are] gardens of favor. [... ]

ثُمَّ أَنْتُمْ هَـٰؤُلاۤءِ تَقْتُلُونَ أَنْفُسَكُمْ وَتُخْرِجُونَ فَرِيقاً مِّنْكُمْ مِّن دِيَارِهِمْ تَظَاهَرُونَ عَلَيْهِمْ بِٱلإِثْمِ وَالْعُدْوَانِ وَإِن يَأتُوكُمْ أُسَارَىٰ تُفَادُوهُمْ وَهُوَ مُحَرَّمٌ عَلَيْكُمْ إِخْرَاجُهُمْ أَفَتُؤْمِنُونَ بِبَعْضِ ٱلْكِتَابِ وَتَكْفُرُونَ بِبَعْضٍ فَمَا جَزَآءُ مَن يَفْعَلُ ذٰلِكَ مِنكُمْ إِلاَّ خِزْيٌ فِي ٱلْحَيَاةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَيَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ يُرَدُّونَ إِلَىٰ أَشَدِّ ٱلّعَذَابِ وَمَا ٱللَّهُ بِغَافِلٍ عَمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ,And when We made a covenant with the children of Israel: “You shall not worship any other than God; and be good to parents and the near of kin; and to orphans and to the needy; and speak well to men; and observe the prayer and pay the alms” then you turned away; all but a few of you rejecting. And when We made a covenant with you: “Shed no blood among you nor turn out your own people from your homes.” Then you confirmed it and you bore witness. Then there you are killing one another and expelling a party of you from their habitations conspiring against them in sin and enmity and if they come to you as captives you ransom them; yet their expulsion was forbidden you. What do you believe in part of the Book and disbelieve in partḍ And if they come to you as captives you ransom them that is “Just as you protect their rights by ransoming them so must you restrain your hands from them and forswear expelling them from their homelands. When you uphold some of what has been made obligatory for you what keeps you from doing the rest of what you have been commanded to doḍ Do you not know that whoever picks and chooses in what he has been commanded so that he believes in some parts and disbelieves in others has the reward for his deeds nullified because of what he has neglectedḍ” What shall be the requital of those of you who do that but degrada- tion in the life of this world; and on the Day of Resurrection to be returned to the most terrible of chastisementḍ And God is not heedless of what you do. That is they thought that what they did would benefit them but in the hereafter it will be disclosed to them that everything that they did when it was combined with what was damaging and stripped of sincerity and devotion was not accepted from them. The captives are of different types. The rescue of the captive drowning in the sea of whim hawā is to be directed to guidance. The ransom of the captive who remains in the hands of whisperings wasāwis is to show him the way to certainty by the glimmers of proofs.
أُولَـٰئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱشْتَرَوُاْ ٱلْحَيَاةَ ٱلدُّنْيَا بِٱلآخِرَةِ فَلاَ يُخَفَّفُ عَنْهُمُ ٱلْعَذَابُ وَلاَ هُمْ يُنصَرُونَ,Those are the ones who have purchased the life of this world at the price of the hereafter-for them the punishment shall not be lightened neither shall they be helped. Those who have preferred anything over [God] have lost in this world and the hereafter. As they have said: People turned away from us without cause or sense. If they have no need of us we have even less need of them.
وَلَقَدْ آتَيْنَا مُوسَىٰ ٱلْكِتَابَ وَقَفَّيْنَا مِن بَعْدِهِ بِٱلرُّسُلِ وَآتَيْنَا عِيسَى ٱبْنَ مَرْيَمَ ٱلْبَيِّنَاتِ وَأَيَّدْنَاهُ بِرُوحِ ٱلْقُدُسِ أَفَكُلَّمَا جَآءَكُمْ رَسُولٌ بِمَا لاَ تَهْوَىٰ أَنْفُسُكُمْ ٱسْتَكْبَرْتُمْ فَفَرِيقاً كَذَّبْتُمْ وَفَرِيقاً تَقْتُلُونَ,And We gave Moses the scripture and after him We sent successive mes- sengers and We gave Jesus son of Mary the clear proofs and We confirmed him with the holy spirit and whenever there came to you a messenger with what your souls did not desire you became arrogant; and some you called liars and some you slayḍ The allusion is that “We [God] delivered the address to them and made one messenger follow after another all calling to the same thing. But they listened to the call of the callers with the ear of whim hawā; they accepted what their lower selves found pleasurable and rejected what their whims ahwāÌ found troublesome. They were characterized by this self-serving desire and moreover became servants ʿabadū to it. The [human] attributes of the worshiper ʿābid became the object of worship maʿbūd.” What a terrible affliction is upon them!
وَقَالُواْ قُلُوبُنَا غُلْفٌ بَل لَّعَنَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ بِكُفْرِهِمْ فَقَلِيلاً مَّا يُؤْمِنُونَ,And they say: “Our hearts are encased.” Nay but God has cursed them for their unbelief; and little will they believe. If there had been anything in them free of pretension it would have become easy to find meanings [from God's signs and scripture]. But when [they must] recognize the truth the fangs of pretenders are bared... It is said: When tears flow down cheeks The one who is crying is distinguished from the one who is only pretending.
وَلَمَّا جَآءَهُمْ كِتَابٌ مِّنْ عِندِ ٱللَّهِ مُصَدِّقٌ لِّمَا مَعَهُمْ وَكَانُواْ مِن قَبْلُ يَسْتَفْتِحُونَ عَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ فَلَمَّا جَآءَهُمْ مَّا عَرَفُواْ كَفَرُواْ بِهِ فَلَعْنَةُ ٱللَّهِ عَلَى ٱلْكَافِرِينَ,\ When there came to them a Book from God confirming what was with them-and they formerly prayed for victory over the disbelievers; but when there came to them what they recognized they disbelieved in it; and the curse of God is on the disbelievers. Here the allusion is to one who resolves upon purity and clarity ṣafāÌ and promises his complete loyalty wafāÌ. He raises the banners of his vigor to step out to combat but when the call comes to line up and advance boldly into battle he breaks down at the rallying of the ranks and cuts himself off from the group afraid of dangerous attacks. God most high said “Then when the matter has been resolved upon if they are loyal to God it will be better for them” [47:21].
بِئْسَمَا ٱشْتَرَوْاْ بِهِ أَنْفُسَهُمْ أَن يَكْفُرُواْ بِمَآ أنَزَلَ ٱللَّهُ بَغْياً أَن يُنَزِّلُ ٱللَّهُ مِن فَضْلِهِ عَلَىٰ مَن يَشَآءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ فَبَآءُو بِغَضَبٍ عَلَىٰ غَضَبٍ وَلِلْكَافِرِينَ عَذَابٌ مُّهِينٌ,Evil is that for which they sell their souls; that they disbelieve in that which God has revealed grudging that God should reveal of His bounty to whomever He will of His servants; and they were laden with anger upon anger; and for the disbelievers there shall be a humiliating chastisement. Envy caused them to descend from the abode of nobility to the lowland of ignominy. When they were not satisfied with what the decree brought they were reduced to a state of abasement. They invited upon themselves that which brings wrath upon wrath.
وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمْ آمِنُواْ بِمَا أَنْزَلَ اللَّهُ قَالُواْ نُؤْمِنُ بِمَآ أُنْزِلَ عَلَيْنَا وَيَكْفُرونَ بِمَا وَرَآءَهُ وَهُوَ ٱلْحَقُّ مُصَدِّقاً لِّمَا مَعَهُمْ قُلْ فَلِمَ تَقْتُلُونَ أَنْبِيَآءَ ٱللَّهِ مِن قَبْلُ إِن كُنْتُمْ مُّؤْمِنِينَ,And when it was said to them “Believe in what God has revealed” they said “We believe in what was revealed to us” and they disbelieve in what is beyond that; yet it is the truth confirming what is with them. Say: “Why then were you slaying the prophets of God formerly if you were believersḍ” Here the allusion is that when it is said to them “Recognize the truth of what has been shown to you from the decree of [divine] harmony min ḥukm al-wifāq by recognizing the situation and the establishment of proof” their lower selves permit some of what they find ambiguous insofar as it agrees with their self-serving desires but then they disbelieve in what is beyond their worldly concerns. They are distant from the elite and are not considered to be among the masters who have special claim arbāb al-ikhtiṣāṣ.
وَلَقَدْ جَآءَكُمْ مُّوسَىٰ بِٱلْبَيِّنَاتِ ثُمَّ ٱتَّخَذْتُمُ ٱلْعِجْلَ مِن بَعْدِهِ وَأَنْتُمْ ظَالِمُونَ,And Moses came to you with clear proofs; then you took to yourselves the calf after him and you were evildoers. That is “he called you to declare [God's] unity tawḥīd and separate the [proper] object of worship from any other object of worship maʿbūd and limited thing maḥdūd. But you were not inclined to worship anything except what was attractive to you-the calf you adopted for yourselves and the idol you desired.” [The calf] was taken from them but its traces remained in their hearts and in the hearts of those who came after them. Because of that most Jews believe in anthropomorphism tashbīh.
وَإِذْ أَخَذْنَا مِيثَاقَكُمْ وَرَفَعْنَا فَوْقَكُمُ ٱلطُّورَ خُذُواْ مَآ ءَاتَيْنَٰكُم بِقُوَّةٍ وَٱسْمَعُواْ قَالُواْ سَمِعْنَا وَعَصَيْنَا وَأُشْرِبُواْ فِي قُلُوبِهِمُ ٱلْعِجْلَ بِكُفْرِهِمْ قُلْ بِئْسَمَا يَأْمُرُكُمْ بِهِ إِيمَانُكُمْ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ مُّؤْمِنِينَ,And when We made a covenant with you and raised over you the mount “Take forcefully what We have given you and listen” they said “We hear and disobey”; and they were made to drink the calf in their hearts on account of their unbelief. Say: “Evil is that which your belief enjoins on you if you are believers.” He reiterates the tale of their excessive love for the calf their aversion to accepting the Real and [... ] and their being told of the punishment that would overtake them for the evil they did. No counsel was useful to them and no punishment led them to refrain from their disobediences. They paid no mind to censure lā bi-l-dhamm fīhim iḥtafalū and did not act according to what the situation required wa-lā bi-mūjibi al-amr ʿamilū.
قُلْ إِن كَانَتْ لَكُمُ ٱلدَّارُ ٱلآخِرَةُ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ خَالِصَةً مِّن دُونِ ٱلنَّاسِ فَتَمَنَّوُاْ ٱلْمَوْتَ إِن كُنْتُمْ صَادِقِينَ  *  وَلَنْ يَتَمَنَّوْهُ أَبَداً بِمَا قَدَّمَتْ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ بِٱلظَّالِمينَ,Say: “If the abode of the hereafter with God is purely yours and not for other people then long for death-if you speak truly.” But they will never long for it because of that which their own hands have sent before them. God knows the evildoers. Among the signs of ardent longing ishtiyāq is the desire for death while in the best of health and well-being. Whoever is absolutely and without any doubt confident that the garden is his ardently longs for it. But they did not long for the garden-and God سبحانه said that they will never long for it-and this information was a miracle for the Messenger ﷺ since it was as He had said. In this is good news for the believers who ardently long for death; there is forgiveness for them. He only bestows the ardent longing on them so that it may be actualized [when] they reach the garden. Of old it was said “For the negligent shame will suffice on the Day of the Meeting.” God most high said “But they will never long for it because of that which their own hands have sent before them.”

وَلَتَجِدَنَّهُمْ أَحْرَصَ ٱلنَّاسِ عَلَىٰ حَيَاةٍ وَمِنَ ٱلَّذِينَ أَشْرَكُواْ يَوَدُّ أَحَدُهُمْ لَوْ يُعَمَّرُ أَلْفَ سَنَةٍ وَمَا هُوَ بِمُزَحْزِحِهِ مِنَ ٱلْعَذَابِ أَن يُعَمَّرَ وَٱللَّهُ بَصِيرٌ بِمَا يَعْمَلُونَ,And you shall find them the people most covetous of life and the idola- ters; any one of them would love that he might be given life for a thousand years; yet his being given life shall not budge him from the chastisement. God sees what they do. Love of life in this world is the result of heedlessness ghafla of God. The worst heedlessness is their excessive love to remain in this world. The state of the believer is the opposite of this. Those who are heedless and insolent are eager for life only because they know of their failure to be obedient. The runaway slave does not want to be returned to his master. But for believ- ers the transition [of death] to One from whom only good is expected is better than remaining with those against whose evil they are not secure. The prolonging of life in spite of the certainty of death holds no value for them since [death] comes unexpectedly and life is cut off. What is coming is near. When [one's] life span is completed there is no averting the assaults of the appointed time from the shoulders of hope fa-lā maradda li-hujūmi al-ajal ʿalā aktāfi al-amal.
قُلْ مَن كَانَ عَدُوّاً لِّجِبْرِيلَ فَإِنَّهُ نَزَّلَهُ عَلَىٰ قَلْبِكَ بِإِذْنِ ٱللَّهِ مُصَدِّقاً لِّمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ وَهُدًى وَبُشْرَىٰ لِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ  *  مَن كَانَ عَدُوّاً للَّهِ وَمَلاۤئِكَتِهِ وَرُسُلِهِ وَجِبْرِيلَ وَمِيكَٰلَ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَدُوٌّ لِّلْكَافِرِينَ,Say: “Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel-he it was that brought it down upon your heart by the leave of God confirming what was before it a guid- ance and good tidings for the believers. Whoever is an enemy to God and His angels and His messengers and Gabriel and Michael-then surely God is an enemy to the disbelievers.” The Jews claimed that Gabriel did not come with good that they did not love him and that if it had been Michael they would have believed in him. The Real سبحانه showed them to be liars when He said “Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel [thinking] he did not bring good what good is greater than the QurÌān that descended through himḍ” Then He said that whoever is an enemy to Gabriel and Michael God is his enemy. Surely the messenger of the Beloved to the highly-esteemed beloved [Muḥammad] has a noble status and weighty rank. The enmity of the disbelievers does not harm Gabriel-the Real سبحانه وتعالى is his protector walī. Whoever is an enemy of Gabriel God is his enemy. How mighty and glori- fied is this status! How grand is His exaltedness!

وَلَقَدْ أَنْزَلْنَآ إِلَيْكَ آيَاتٍ بَيِّنَاتٍ وَمَا يَكْفُرُ بِهَآ إِلاَّ ٱلْفَاسِقُونَ  *  أَوَكُلَّمَا عَاهَدُواْ عَهْداً نَّبَذَهُ فَرِيقٌ مِّنْهُم بَلْ أَكْثَرُهُمْ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ,And We have revealed to you clear proofs; and none disbelieves inthem except the wicked. Why whenever they make a covenant does a party of them reject itḍ Nay but most of them are disbelievers. One disbelieves in His clear signs only when one's eyes are blocked from perceiving and one's fate from God has already been determined as unfor- tunate. There is no sense in anyone who denies that day is day. Likewise there is no union for anyone who has not been assisted by lights and insights from the Real. Why whenever they made a covenant...: their predetermined fate sābiq al-taqdīr confounded them and their subsequent contrivances lāḥiq al-tadbīr broke their covenant. God prevails over His affair.

وَلَمَّآ جَآءَهُمْ رَسُولٌ مِّنْ عِندِ ٱللَّهِ مُصَدِّقٌ لِّمَا مَعَهُمْ نَبَذَ فَرِيقٌ مِّنَ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ كِتَٰبَ ٱللَّهِ وَرَآءَ ظُهُورِهِمْ كَأَنَّهُمْ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ,When there came to them a messenger from God confirming what was with them a party of those who had been given the scripture cast away the scripture of God behind their backs as though they did not know. They denied the messengers of the Real that came to their hearts by means of intuitions khawāṬir and [they] belied the messengers who came to them outwardly. O ignorance in which there is not a sliver of deeper knowledge ʿirfān! O deprivation whose companion is disappointment khidhlān!
وَٱتَّبَعُواْ مَا تَتْلُواْ ٱلشَّيَـٰطِينُ عَلَىٰ مُلْكِ سُلَيْمَـٰنَ وَمَا كَفَرَ سُلَيْمَـٰنُ وَلَـٰكِنَّ ٱلشَّيَـٰطِينَ كَفَرُواْ يُعَلِّمُونَ ٱلنَّاسَ ٱلسِّحْرَ وَمَآ أُنْزِلَ عَلَى ٱلْمَلَكَيْنِ بِبَابِلَ هَـٰرُوتَ وَمَـٰرُوتَ وَمَا يُعَلِّمَانِ مِنْ أَحَدٍ حَتَّىٰ يَقُولاَ إِنَّمَا نَحْنُ فِتْنَةٌ فَلاَ تَكْفُرْ فَيَتَعَلَّمُونَ مِنْهُمَا مَا يُفَرِّقُونَ بِهِ بَيْنَ ٱلْمَرْءِ وَزَوْجِهِ وَمَا هُم بِضَآرِّينَ بِهِ مِنْ أَحَدٍ إِلاَّ بِإِذْنِ ٱللَّهِ وَيَتَعَلَّمُونَ مَا يَضُرُّهُمْ وَلاَ يَنفَعُهُمْ وَلَقَدْ عَلِمُواْ لَمَنِ ٱشْتَرَاهُ مَا لَهُ فِي ٱلآخِرَةِ مِنْ خَلَٰـقٍ وَلَبِئْسَ مَا شَرَوْاْ بِهِ أَنْفُسَهُمْ لَوْ كَانُواْ يَعْلَمُونَ,And they follow what the devils used to relate during the reign of Solomon: Solomon disbelieved not but the devils disbelieved and taught the people sorcery; and that which was revealed to the two angels in Babylon- Hārūt and Mārūt. They taught not any man without them saying “We are but a temptation; do not disbelieve.” From them they learned how they might cause division between a man and his wife yet they did not hurt any man thereby save by the leave of God; and they learned what hurt them and did not profit them. And surely they knew well that whoever buys it he shall have no share in the hereafter; Whoever is divided by his whims ahwāÌ falls into one state of heedless- ness ghafla after another so that every kind of ignorant affair welcomes him. Moreover those whose absence [from the Beloved] is prolonged become a warning to others and a temptation for whoever follows their path. Whoever emulates them in their transgression joins their commu- nity and becomes one of them. This is the case in the description of Hārūt and Mārūt and what happened to them-they became a temptation and a warning for men. One who listens to what they say and does not take into account their ignorance will share in their tribulation balāÌuhumā and suffer their distress ʿanāÌuhumā in the hereafter. The allusion in their story is to the one on this path Ṭarīqa who is inclined to affectation deception and pretension. He attracts followers whom he leads to hell by his falsehood and blocks them from the path of right direction by the evil of his darknesses. But those who take heed cross over to safety on its bridges and the one who is disgraced tahattaka by his inclinations to falsehoods-his veils astāruhu are torn tahattakat and his faults ʿawāruhu are exposed to anyone with eyes. When Hārūt and Mārūt were deceived by the disobedience to which they had become accustomed they blamed [their being deceived on] the disobedience of the children of Adam. Because of their tendencies toward carnal desires and the promptings to temptations and harmful things they plunged forward into disobedience. What happened to them is what the storytellers relate: they are hanging upside down until the Day of the Resurrection and if not for [God's] gentleness rifq toward them and their affair their punishment would not end then.
وَلَوْ أَنَّهُمْ آمَنُواْ وٱتَّقَوْا لَمَثُوبَةٌ مِّنْ عِندِ ٱللَّهِ خَيْرٌ لَّوْ كَانُواْ يَعْلَمُونَ,Yet if only they had believed and been fearful verily a reward from God would have been better if they had but known. If they had only preferred drawing near iqbāl to God over being dis- tracted ishtighāl from Him they would have obtained the treasure of the two abodes dhukhra al-dārayn and reached the glory of the two worlds ʿizza al-kawnayn. But the blows of subjugation pressed upon them kasa- bathum saṬawātu al-qahr and kept them in the lands of abandonment fa-athbatathum fī mawāṬini al-hajr.
يَٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ لاَ تَقُولُواْ رَاعِنَا وَقُولُواْ ٱنْظُرْنَا وَٱسْمَعُواْ وَلِلكَافِرِينَ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,O you who believe do not say “Observe us”; but say “Regard us” and listen; and for disbelievers awaits a painful chastisement. The objectives of enemies in all their states fī jamīʿi aḥwālihim including their actions and words min aʿmālihim wa-aqwālihim are malicious for they remain tied to their ways in what they do and do not do. The way of the friends [of God] is to avoid being like them and to adopt a path which is not their path.
مَّا يَوَدُّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِنْ أَهْلِ ٱلْكِتَابِ وَلاَ ٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ أَن يُنَزَّلَ عَلَيْكُمْ مِّنْ خَيْرٍ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ يَخْتَصُّ بِرَحْمَتِهِ مَن يَشَآءُ وَٱللَّهُ ذُو ٱلْفَضْلِ ٱلْعَظِيمِ,Those disbelievers of the people of the scripture and the idolaters do not wish that any good should be revealed to you from your Lord but God singles out for His mercy whom He will; God's grace is most abundant. The antipathy of the enemies toward the unwavering decency of the friends is unceasing and enduring. But the envious [one] shall not prevail lākin al-ḥasūda lā yasūd nor will he obtain what he seeks wa lā yaḥṣul lahu maqṣūd. The special qualities of mercy are sufficient for the friends even if the enemies are abased and the flanks and borders of the lands of their rejoicing are destroyed.
مَا نَنسَخْ مِنْ آيَةٍ أَوْ نُنسِهَا نَأْتِ بِخَيْرٍ مِّنْهَا أَوْ مِثْلِهَا أَلَمْ تَعْلَمْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,And whatever verse We abrogate or postpone We bring [in place] a better or the like of it; do you not know that God has power over all thingsḍ Abrogation naskh is the removal of something; that is [it is] what moves you from one state to that which is above and superior to it for the branch of your communion is forever flourishing and the star of your nobility is forever shining. “We do not abrogate anything of the traces of worship ʿibāda without substituting for it something from the lights of servant- hood ʿubūdiyya. And We do not abrogate anything from the lights of servanthood without putting something in its place from the moons of servitude ʿubūda.Your innermost self is always rising taraqqā and your worth increases [when you take on] the beauty of the [divine] friend- ship tawallā.” It is said “We will not raise you from the place of servanthood ʿubūdiyya without causing you to alight on the plains of freedom ḥurriyya. We have not removed anything of your human attributes ṣifāt al-bashariyya without elevating you in some divine witnessing shawāhid al-ulūhiyya.”
أَلَمْ تَعْلَمْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَهُ مُلْكُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَمَا لَكُمْ مِّن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ مِن وَلِيٍّ وَلاَ نَصِيرٍ,Do you not know that to God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and that you have none besides God neither protector nor helperḍ His سبحانه way sunna is to draw His friends from the witnessing of what He possesses milk to the vision of His kingdom mulk. Then He takes them from the vision of His kingdom to witnessing His truth ḥaqq and then [He] takes them from the vision of His signs ayāt to the vision of His attributes ṣifāt and from the vision of His attributes to the witnessing of His essence dhāt.
أَمْ تُرِيدُونَ أَن تَسْأَلُواْ رَسُولَكُمْ كَمَا سُئِلَ مُوسَىٰ مِن قَبْلُ وَمَن يَتَبَدَّلِ ٱلْكُفْرَ بِٱلإِيمَانِ فَقَدْ ضَلَّ سَوَآءَ ٱلسَّبِيلِ,Or do you desire to question your messenger as Moses was questioned aforetimeḍ Whoever exchanges belief for unbelief has surely strayed from the even way. The children of Israel annoyed Moses عليه السلام and the Muslims were prohibited from following this precedent. They were commanded to be conscious of the bashfulness of the Messenger ﷺ as much as possible so that in his presence they were silent with awe. [God] most high said Support him and revere him [48:9].195 The beauty of refined behavior adab in outward circumstances is a model for the beauty of refined behavior with God inwardly.
وَدَّ كَثِيرٌ مِّنْ أَهْلِ ٱلْكِتَابِ لَوْ يَرُدُّونَكُم مِنْ بَعْدِ إِيمَانِكُمْ كُفَّاراً حَسَداً مِّنْ عِنْدِ أَنْفُسِهِمْ مِّن بَعْدِ مَا تَبَيَّنَ لَهُمُ ٱلْحَقُّ فَٱعْفُواْ وَٱصْفَحُواْ حَتَّىٰ يَأْتِيَ ٱللَّهُ بِأَمْرِهِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,Many of the people of the scripture long to make you disbelievers after you have believed from the envy of their own souls after the truth has become clear to them; yet pardon and be forgiving till God brings His com- mand; truly God has power over all things. Those among the heedless who have lost understanding wish that not even a star would rise over those who are in peace and safety salāma and those who are possessed by envy would like the sun to stop shining over those whom they envy. These are the attributes of disbelievers so God abases and humbles them. The allusion in this is to the state of those who possess spiritual desire irāda in the beginning when they embark on their travels. If they do not find help and success in companionship and they live among people following externals these people will prevent them from traveling and will not stop giving advice to them. They will frighten them with weak- ness and threaten them with poverty until they divert them to the way of heedlessness and cut them off from the path of spiritual desire. These are truly the enemies of God those who have been overtaken by the enmity of the moment. Their punishment is being deprived of smelling any of the fragrances of sincerity ṣidq. Yet pardon and be forgiving... for the way of the aspirant is to protect his innermost self from anyone or anything other [than God]. He tries to employ his best nature with each individual and spares no effort in kindness for soon the Real will open the way for him on his path.
وَأَقِيمُواْ ٱلصَّلَٰوةَ وَآتُواْ ٱلزَّكَٰوةَ وَمَا تُقَدِّمُواْ لأَنْفُسِكُم مِّنْ خَيْرٍ تَجِدُوهُ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ,And perform the prayer and pay the alms; whatever good you shall offer for your own souls you shall find it with God; assuredly God sees what you do. The obligation for the aspirant is to perform the acts of intimate communication muwāṣalāt and to continually seek to gain access with different kinds of acts of drawing near qurubāt trusting that what he offers in sincere difficult efforts mujāhadāt will bear fruit in the final states hālāt.
وَقَالُواْ لَن يَدْخُلَ ٱلْجَنَّةَ إِلاَّ مَن كَانَ هُوداً أَوْ نَصَارَىٰ تِلْكَ أَمَانِيُّهُمْ قُلْ هَاتُواْ بُرْهَانَكُمْ إِن كُنْتُمْ صَادِقِينَ,And they say “None shall enter paradise except those who are Jews or Christians.” Such are their desires. Say “Produce your proof if you speak truly.” Each party ḥizb smooths things out199 for itself thinking salvation belongs to it and claiming access [to paradise] as its share. But mere guessing ḥusbān without the verification of proof burhān does not produce results lā yaÌtī bi-ḥāṣil nor is it of any use wa lā yaḥūz bi-ṬāÌil.
بَلَىٰ مَنْ أَسْلَمَ وَجْهَهُ للَّهِ وَهُوَ مُحْسِنٌ فَلَهُ أَجْرُهُ عِندَ رَبِّهِ وَلاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلاَ هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ,Nay but whoever submits his purpose to God being virtuous his reward is with his Lord and no fear shall befall them neither shall they grieve. He submits his purpose aslama wajhahu means he remains loyal to the quest for God devotes his purpose to God alone and purifies his resolve from any faults. Being virtuous [means] possessing knowledge by the truth of what he does and the truth of what he practices. He is virtuous in the end wa-huwa muḥsin fī l-maÌāl just as he submits in the present kamā annahu muslim fī l-ḥāl. It is said that virtuousness iḥsān is that you worship God as if you see Him so that you will be submitting with your outward form and witnessing with your innermost hearts. Outwardly there is effort and physical prostra- tion fī l-ẓāhir jahd wa-sujūd and inwardly there is unveiling and ecstatic finding fī l-bāṬin kashf wa-wujūd. It is said that one submits his purpose by persisting in obedient actions being virtuous maintaining the good manners of service ādāb al-khidma by the beautiful manners of presence bi-ḥusni ādāb al-ḥuḌūr. No fear of abandonment will befall them khawf al-hajr neither will secret deception khafīy al-makr overcome them. This world will not distract them from wit- nessing and tomorrow the hereafter will not distract them from the vision.
وَقَالَتِ ٱلْيَهُودُ لَيْسَتِ ٱلنَّصَارَىٰ عَلَىٰ شَيْءٍ وَقَالَتِ ٱلنَّصَارَىٰ لَيْسَتِ ٱلْيَهُودُ عَلَىٰ شَيْءٍ وَهُمْ يَتْلُونَ ٱلْكِتَابَ كَذَلِكَ قَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ مِثْلَ قَوْلِهِمْ فَٱللَّهُ يَحْكُمُ بَيْنَهُمْ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ فِيمَا كَانُواْ فِيهِ يَخْتَلِفُونَ,The Jews say “The Christians stand on nothing”; and the Christians say “The Jews stand on nothing”; yet they recite the scripture. Thus the ignorant say the like of what these say; God shall decide between them on the Day of Resurrection regarding their differences. The allusion in this verse is an inversion of its apparent sense. Today the enemies [of God] disclaim one another [as they have done in the past] but the friends [of God] also do something like that. Nonetheless it is said that the Sufis will remain in a good state as long as they quarrel and do not accept one other because if they were to accept one another they would stay with each other [rather than turning to God].
وَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّنْ مَّنَعَ مَسَاجِدَ ٱللَّهِ أَن يُذْكَرَ فِيهَا ٱسْمُهُ وَسَعَىٰ فِي خَرَابِهَآ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ مَا كَانَ لَهُمْ أَن يَدْخُلُوهَآ إِلاَّ خَآئِفِينَ لَّهُمْ فِي ٱلدُّنْيَا خِزْيٌ وَلَهُمْ فِي ٱلآخِرَةِ عَذَابٌ عَظِيمٌ,And who does greater evil than he who bars God's places of worship so that His name be not invoked in them and strives to ruin themḍ; such men might never enter them save in fear; for this world is degradation for them; and in the hereafter a mighty chastisement. [Here] the allusion is to the one who does evil one who ruins the home- lands awṬān of worship with [his] carnal passions shahawāt-and the homelands of worship are the selves of the worshipers nufūs al-ʿābidīn. He ruins the homelands of knowledge with [his] desires and attachments ʿalāqāt-and the homelands of knowledge are the hearts of those with deep knowledge qulūb al-ʿārifīn. He destroys the homelands of love with [his] worldly concerns and familiar comforts musākanāt-and [the home- lands of love] are the spirits of the ecstatics arwāḥ al-wājidīn. He ruins the homelands of witnessing by paying attention to [his own] attempts to draw near qurubāt [rather than turning to God Himself] and [the homelands of witnessing] are the innermost selves of those who declare oneness asrār al-muwaḥḥidīn. For them in this world is degradation; and in the hereafter a mighty chastisement. For the people of allusion the degradation of this world is the ignominy of the veil and the punishment of the hereafter is being held back in degrees.
وَللَّهِ ٱلْمَشْرِقُ وَٱلْمَغْرِبُ فَأَيْنَمَا تُوَلُّواْ فَثَمَّ وَجْهُ ٱللَّهِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ وَاسِعٌ عَلِيمٌ,To God belong the East and the West; whithersoever you turn there is the face of God. Lo! God is Embracing Knowing. Here the allusion is to the eastern and western places of hearts [of the believers]. Hearts have rising lights shawāriq and night visitors Ṭawāriq. The night visitors are the murmurings hawājis of the lower selves that arrive in the darknesses of desire and carnal passions. The rising lights are the stars of different types of knowledge the moons of presence and the suns of gnosis. As long as the lights are rising the qibla of the hearts is clear and visible. Then when the realities take over the authority of the lights becomes hid- den like stars at the rising of the sun. Similarly at the appearance of the Real there is destruction and subjugation so there is no witnessing of any trace no remaining sensation or comprehension no power of intellect or knowledge no illumination of deeper knowledge. For the experiencing of all these qualities lasts only as long as human nature lasts. When those who have attributes become effaced how can any attribute of theirs remainḍ He said “whithersoever you turn there is the face of God.” As long as there is a remnant or even a sliver of sensory perception and the ability to differentiate then the qibla should be aimed for and if it is not known it should be sought. According to scholars when the guideposts in every direction are obscure and there is no knowledge of the qibla all directions are equally permissible for prayer since none of them can be preferred for the intention niyya.
وَقَالُواْ ٱتَّخَذَ ٱللَّهُ وَلَداً سُبْحَـٰنَهُ بَل لَّهُ مَا فِي ٱلسَّمَـٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ كُلٌّ لَّهُ قَانِتُونَ,And they say “God has taken to Himself a son”; Glory be to Him! He deceived them when He did not bring them to naught right away. Instead He made their continued delusion a longer respite. They spoke a grave calumny ʿaẓīm al-firya against God and devised an astonishing argument ʿajīb al-mirya in their description of God and attribution of a son to Him. How can there be a son when He is singular in [His] essence dhātḍ There is no delimitation of His essence and no carnal desire pos- sible in His attributes ṣifāt. Nay to Him belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth; all obey His will. That is nothing-from the traces of things or things themselves- has come into being kawn without the traces of the created constitution khilqa calling out to it and the testimonial witnessings of the original nature fiṬra speaking clearly from it. Every silent thing is [in fact] speak- ing and is a proof and a witness to His سبحانه oneness.
بَدِيعُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَإِذَا قَضَىٰ أَمْراً فَإِنَّمَا يَقُولُ لَهُ كُنْ فَيَكُونُ,Originator of the heavens and the earth; and when He decrees a thing He but says to it “Be” and it is. The Originator al-badīʿ according to the scholars is the One who brings the entity ʿayn into existence without any model lā ʿalā mithāl. According to the people of allusion He is the One and there is nothing like Him laysa lahu shayun mithlihi since this term alludes to both the negation of any likeness mithl to His essence and the negation of any model mithāl for His acts. He is the One al-aḥad without any quantity comprising Him; the Eternal al-ṣamad whom no final point in time cuts off; the Real al-ḥaqq whom no imagination can picture; and the Existent al-mawjūd of whom no understanding is capable. When He decides on an affair nothing preordained maqdūr can oppose it and nothing created mafṬūr can separate itself from His decree.
وَقَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ لَوْلاَ يُكَلِّمُنَا ٱللَّهُ أَوْ تَأْتِينَآ آيَةٌ كَذَلِكَ قَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ مِّثْلَ قَوْلِهِمْ تَشَابَهَتْ قُلُوبُهُمْ قَدْ بَيَّنَّا ٱلآيَاتِ لِقَوْمٍ يُوقِنُونَ,And they who do not know say “Why does God not speak to usḍ; Why does a sign not come to usḍ” So spoke those before them the like of what they say; their hearts are much alike. Yet We have made clear the signs to a people who are certain. The speech kalām of God سبحانه is connected to all created things in their entities aʿyān and their traces āthār by the command to “Be!” amr al-takwīn [and it is also connected to] those who have been charged [with the law] by the prescriptive command amr al-taklīf. But whoever lacks the ear of comprehension is deaf to hearing the Real. He سبحانه addressed some among the people of the Book and they heard His address but they were not able to bear it and after they recognized the enormity of the signs they engaged in distortion and alteration. Included in the signs which He made manifest were that which removes the defect of anything other [than Him] al-ʿilla min al-aghyār and quenches the thirst from things that are better al-ghulla min al-akhyār. But what proofs even if they were plain and clear would suffice those whose due is wretchedness whose [wretch- edness] has already comeḍ
إِنَّا أَرْسَلْنَاكَ بِٱلْحَقِّ بَشِيراً وَنَذِيراً وَلاَ تُسْأَلُ عَنْ أَصْحَابِ ٱلْجَحِيمِ,We have sent you with the truth a bearer of good tidings and warner. You shall not be asked about the inhabitants of hellfire. “We have singled you out [O Muḥammad] with qualities which We did not make appear in anyone else so all people are under your banner. Those who are accepted are in conformity with you while those who are rejected oppose you al-maqbūl man wāfaqaka wa-l-mardūd man khālafaka. You will not be questioned about the states of others and you will not be turned away because of anyone.”
وَلَنْ تَرْضَىٰ عَنكَ ٱلْيَهُودُ وَلاَ ٱلنَّصَارَىٰ حَتَّىٰ تَتَّبِعَ مِلَّتَهُمْ قُلْ إِنَّ هُدَى ٱللَّهِ هُوَ ٱلْهُدَىٰ وَلَئِنِ ٱتَّبَعْتَ أَهْوَآءَهُمْ بَعْدَ ٱلَّذِي جَآءَكَ مِنَ ٱلْعِلْمِ مَا لَكَ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ مِن وَلِيٍّ وَلاَ نَصِيرٍ,Never will the Jews be pleased with you neither the Christians not until you follow their creed Say: “God's guidance is the true guidance.” And if you were to follow their whims after the knowledge that has come to you you shall have against God neither friend nor helper. “Do not concern yourself with pleasing the enemies after you have received Our good pleasure riḌāÌ for they will not be pleased with you unless you follow their religions and that is impossible. So declare yourself free of them make your difference apparent and show enmity toward them. Know that their reliance on what they find pleasing is the cause of endless wretchedness. Do not worry yourself. Call your community to free them- selves from them and their path and be for Us through Us free of anyone other than Us trusting in Our help for you are through Us and from Us.”
ٱلَّذِينَ آتَيْنَاهُمُ ٱلْكِتَـٰبَ يَتْلُونَهُ حَقَّ تِلاَوَتِهِ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِهِ وَمن يَكْفُرْ بِهِ فَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْخَٰسِرُونَ,Those to whom We have given the scripture and who recite it with true recitation they believe in it; and whoever disbelieves in it they shall be the losers. “Those whom We have opened the eyes of their hearts to witnessing Our truth-We have entrusted the ears of their hearts with hearing Our address. We have chosen them by letting the lights of solicitude shine down on them and We have supported them by confirming the instruction in their innermost selves asrār. They practice the true recitation and are characterized by the qualities of faith and deep knowledge. They are the people of special designation takhṣīṣ and those who are not with them are the rejected.”
يَابَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ ٱذْكُرُواْ نِعْمَتِيَ ٱلَّتِيۤ أَنْعَمْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ وَأَنِّي فَضَّلْتُكُمْ عَلَى ٱلْعَالَمِينَ,O children of Israel remember My favor wherewith I favored you and that I have preferred you over all the worlds. His سبحانه way sunna in His address to the people of Moses عليه السلام is to call them by their proper name saying “O children of Israel remember... ” that is “O children of Jacob.” But He addresses this community [of Muḥammad] honorifically saying “O you who believe...”
وَٱتَّقُواْ يَوْماً لاَّ تَجْزِي نَفْسٌ عَن نَّفْسٍ شَيْئاً وَلاَ يُقْبَلُ مِنْهَا عَدْلٌ وَلاَ تَنفَعُهَا شَفَاعَةٌ وَلاَ هُمْ يُنصَرُونَ,And beware of a day when no soul will be requited for another and no compensation will be accepted from it nor will any intercession benefit it neither will they be helped. As for the enemies nothing [that is no payment or compensation] will be accepted from them. As for the friends [the Prophet] ﷺ said “Protect yourself from the fire even if it be by half a date [given in charity].” The intercession of intercessors will not benefit the disbeliever for this is a determination made for each community with their prophet. As for the believers they will benefit in particular from the Prophet's ﷺ intercession. Everyone on that day will be saying “My soul my soul” but our Prophet ﷺ will say “My community my community.”
وَإِذِ ٱبْتَلَىٰ إِبْرَاهِيمَ رَبُّهُ بِكَلِمَاتٍ فَأَتَمَّهُنَّ قَالَ إِنِّي جَاعِلُكَ لِلنَّاسِ إِمَاماً قَالَ وَمِن ذُرِّيَّتِي قَالَ لاَ يَنَالُ عَهْدِي ٱلظَّالِمِينَ,And when his Lord tested Abraham with certain words and he ful- filled them The trial al-balāÌ is the verification of friendship walāÌ and the most sincere in friendship are tested the most. The Real سبحانه tested His friend khalīl عليه السلام by what He imposed on him and prescribed for him and [Abraham] upheld the necessary conditions and fulfilled the requirements decreed. So He سبحانه praised him saying “And Abraham who fulfilled waffā” [53:37] [which is] from tawfiyathat is he did not fall short in any way whatsoever. It is said that [God] imposed the burdens of prophecy on [Abraham] and sought from him the properties of friendship khulla. The most intense trial for him was upholding the conditions of friendship and being singled out to avoid everyone and everything. He performed what was necessary to fulfill this [obligation] withdrawing from everything other than [God] secretly and publicly. Because of that [Abraham] paid no attention to Gabriel عليه السلام when he appeared to [Abraham] as he was being thrown into the depths of destruction. [Gabriel] said “Do you need anythingḍ” [Abraham] said “From youḍ No.” Gabriel عليه السلام appeared to him in this state as part of the perfection of his trial. What [attachments] were left in him that would leave a place for any created being whoever that might beḍ This is a subtle allusion to the difference between the state of our Prophet ﷺ and the state of Abraham عليه السلام because Gabriel appeared to the friend and showed himself to him and [Abraham] said “From youḍ No.” But Gabriel was not capable of companionship with the Prophet ﷺ and thus expressed his weakness saying “If I were to come closer [to you by even] so much as a fingertip I would be consumed by fire.” What a difference between the state in which Gabriel عليه السلام has the power to show himself to the Friend عليه السلام and the state in which he acknowledges his weak- ness before the Beloved ﷺ. He said “I make you a leader imām for the people.” Said he “And of my seedḍ” He said “My covenant shall not reach the evildoers.” The leader imām is the one to be emulated. This was confirmed with regard to [Abraham] in that [God] told all men up to the Day of the Resurrection to emulate him.
وَإِذْ جَعَلْنَا ٱلْبَيْتَ مَثَابَةً لِّلنَّاسِ وَأَمْناً وَٱتَّخِذُواْ مِن مَّقَامِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ مُصَلًّى وَعَهِدْنَآ إِلَىٰ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَإِسْمَاعِيلَ أَن طَهِّرَا بَيْتِيَ لِلطَّائِفِينَ وَٱلْعَاكِفِينَ وَٱلرُّكَّعِ ٱلسُّجُودِ,And when We appointed the House to be a place of visitation for the people and a sanctuary: “Mention O Muḥammad when We appointed the House meaning the Kaʿba to be a place of visitation for people to come to and a sanctuary for them to return to to make their way to it from every direction. It is a House which I created from stone yet attached to eternity. Whoever looks to the House with the eye of creation is cut off while those who look with the eye of far-reaching vision arrive and connect. Everyone who seeks refuge at that House is secure from the punishment of the hereafter if he seeks refuge to show veneration and respect ʿalā jihati al-iʿẓām wa-l-iḥtirām and repent from sins wa-l-tawbati ʿan al-āthām.” It is said that the House was built of stone but it is a stone that attracts hearts just as a magnet attracts iron. [What kind of house is itḍ] A house... Its shade causes whomever comes to it to remain in the courtyard of security amn. A house... Whoever glances upon it receives the good news of forgive- ness attained. A house... Subtleties circumambulate the heart of whoever circum- ambulates it. One circumambulation is by another circumambulation and one circuit is by another circuit. Is the reward of goodness anything but goodnessḍ [55:60]. A house... Whatever one spends of one's wealth to reach it is not lost. A house... Whatever one withholds from it is without profit. Whoever visits it forgets any other place of visitation and abandons his [own] regions. A house... No distance is reckoned too far to it. Visiting it is not to be neglected for fear of unpleasant occurrences or harmful attacks. This is a house which possesses no harm for the lifeblood of the poor fuqarāÌ. A house... Whoever holds back from visiting it lacks noble-heartedness futuwwa or is deficient in love maḥabba. A house... The heart of the one who holds back from it is harder than stones. A house... When the rays of its lights fall upon someone he is made to forget suns and moons. A house... One is not so much amazed by those who stay away from it but rather by how those who come to it can leave! Take to yourselves Abraham's station for a place of prayer; A servant was raised up on his feet for the sake of God سبحانه and his footprints made a qibla for all Muslims to honor him for all time until the resurrection.
وَإِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ رَبِّ ٱجْعَلْ هَـٰذَا بَلَداً آمِناً وَٱرْزُقْ أَهْلَهُ مِنَ ٱلثَّمَرَاتِ مَنْ آمَنَ مِنْهُمْ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلآخِرِ قَالَ وَمَن كَفَرَ فَأُمَتِّعُهُ قَلِيلاً ثُمَّ أَضْطَرُّهُ إِلَىٰ عَذَابِ ٱلنَّارِ وَبِئْسَ ٱلْمَصِيرُ,And when Abraham said “My Lord make this land secure and pro- vide its people with fruits; such of them as believe in God and the Last Day” He said “And whoever disbelieves to him I shall give enjoyment a little then I shall compel him to the chastisement of the fire-how evil a journey's end!” And when Abraham said 'My Lord make this land secure': The request was answered because it was not adulterated by the worldly concern of the servant. Abraham's request was not for his own concern ḥaẓẓ but rather for the right ḥaqq of his Lord may He be exalted and glorified. When Abraham was mindful of the required etiquette in seeking provision for those who believed they were granted that-but so were those who did not believe. [On the other hand] when he spoke about leadership saying “And of my seedḍ” [2:125] without [divine] permission [the request] was denied and it was said to him “My covenant shall not reach the evildoers” [2:125].
وَإِذْ يَرْفَعُ إِبْرَٰهِيمُ ٱلْقَوَاعِدَ مِنَ ٱلْبَيْتِ وَإِسْمَٰعِيلُ رَبَّنَا تَقَبَّلْ مِنَّآ إِنَّكَ أَنتَ ٱلسَّمِيعُ ٱلْعَلِيمُ,And when Abraham raised up the foundations of the House and Ishmael with him: “Our Lord! Receive this from us. Truly You are the Hearing the Knowing. The success of the request is in the sincerity of the supplication nujḥu al-suÌāl fī ṣidqi al-ibtihāl. When the two of them humbly sought aid in prayer He gave them help and fulfilled the request. Truly You are the Hearing of our speech the Knowing of our states.
رَبَّنَا وَٱجْعَلْنَا مُسْلِمَيْنِ لَكَ وَمِن ذُرِّيَّتِنَآ أُمَّةً مُّسْلِمَةً لَّكَ وَأَرِنَا مَنَاسِكَنَا وَتُبْ عَلَيْنَآ إِنَّكَ أَنتَ ٱلتَّوَّابُ ٱلرَّحِيمُ,Our Lord! And make us submissive to You and of our seed a com- munity submissive to You; and show us our holy rites and relent to us. Surely You are the Relenting the Merciful. [That is] “Submissive muslimīn yielding to Your decree so that not one vein of ours throbs without Your good pleasure. Make from our seed a community submissive to You so that after us they will take our place in upholding Your rights.” What a difference between one who seeks someone to inherit his wealth man yaṬlubu wārithan li-mālihi and one who seeks a deputy after him to perform acts of obedience to Him in his states man yaṬlubu nāÌiban... fī aḥwālihi. [That is] “Show us our holy rites since there is no way to know what conforms [to Your will] except by the path that God granted success and communication.” [That is] “And relent to us after we carry out all that You have com- manded us to do so that we do not look to what we do and do not do but turn back to You from witnessing our actions so there is no danger of hidden idolatry al-shirk al-khafī in imagining anything from us or through us.”
رَبَّنَا وَٱبْعَثْ فِيهِمْ رَسُولاً مِّنْهُمْ يَتْلُواْ عَلَيْهِمْ آيَٰتِكَ وَيُعَلِّمُهُمُ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ وَٱلْحِكْمَةَ وَيُزَكِّيهِمْ إِنَّكَ أَنتَ ٱلعَزِيزُ ٱلحَكِيمُ,Our Lord! And send among them a messenger one of them who shall recite to them Your signs and teach them the Book and wisdom and purify them; You are the Mighty the Wise. Because the obligations were received from messengers rather than being understood by reason alone [Abraham] asked that they not be left to themselves without a messenger or law. He requested that the messenger be one of them so that they would feel more at home with him and it would be easier for them. Its meaning rightly understood is that when He سبحانه informed [Abraham] of the state of our Prophet ﷺ [Abraham] asked for the completion of what He had promised by way of the one He commanded.
وَمَن يَرْغَبُ عَن مِّلَّةِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ إِلاَّ مَن سَفِهَ نَفْسَهُ وَلَقَدِ ٱصْطَفَيْنَاهُ فِي ٱلدُّنْيَا وَإِنَّهُ فِي ٱلآخِرَةِ لَمِنَ ٱلصَّالِحِينَ,Who therefore shrinks from the religion of Abraham except he who fools himselfḍ Indeed We chose him in this world and in the hereafter he shall be among the righteous. He related that among created beings He preferred the Friend al-khalīl عليه السلام and therefore made his religion dīn the religion. The distinguishing mark [of the religion] is the declaration of [God's] oneness tawḥīd and its attri- bute is deep knowledge maʿrifa. For whoever shrinks from [Abraham's] religion or deviates from his way fa-man raghiba ʿan dīnihi aw ḥāda ʿan sunnatihi is left with falsehood fa-l-bāṬilu maṬraḥu and falls into disbe- lief wa-l-kufr mahwāhu. For the lights in their entirety are only acquired from [Abraham's] light.
إِذْ قَالَ لَهُ رَبُّهُ أَسْلِمْ قَالَ أَسْلَمْتُ لِرَبِّ ٱلْعَالَمِينَ,When his Lord said to him “Submit” he said “I have submitted to the Lord of the worlds.” Islām is sincerity ikhlāṣ and submission istislām. Its true meaning is to withdraw entirely from the states of mortal humanity bashariyya with respect to the struggles over free choice ikhtiyār and the oppositional tendencies of the lower self muʿāraḌāt al-nafs. [Abraham] said “I have submitted to the Lord of the worlds: I have accepted the command amr hearing and obeying and I have embraced the decree ḥukm as much as I am able.” He did not hold back any of his wealth body or progeny. When he was commanded to sacrifice his son he intended to do it. When [God] said to him “Release him from his bond” he did what he was com- manded to do. There was no free choice in either of the states for him and no contriving tadbīr. It is said that his saying “I have submitted” aslamtu was surely not by way of any claim for himself because the true meaning of islām is rather to absolve oneself of strength and power. So when he said “I have submitted” it was as if he said “Raise me up in what you have charged me with and [help me] carry out that to which you have commanded me.” He turned the affair over to Him without proclaiming any meaning or warrant from himself. It is said that He bid him to take on the demands of the divine power of deliberation muṬālabāt al-qudra. For what dwells in one who takes up his abode in friendship is most certainly what dwells in the other fa-inna man ḥalla fī l-khullati maḥallahu yaḥullu bihi lā maḥālata mā ḥalla bihi. Here one might ask a question: How could Abraham عليه السلام have said “I have submitted” when it was said to our Prophet ﷺ “Know” but he did not say “I have come to knowḍ” [in the manner that Abraham said “I have submitted”]. re are several aspects to the answer one of which is that the Prophet ﷺ said “I am the most knowledgeable of you about God” but since a law did not come after him it used to be said about him that he said “I have come to know” ʿalimtu.
وَوَصَّىٰ بِهَآ إِبْرَاهِيمُ بَنِيهِ وَيَعْقُوبُ يَابَنِيَّ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ ٱصْطَفَىٰ لَكُمُ ٱلدِّينَ فَلاَ تَمُوتُنَّ إِلاَّ وَأَنْتُم مُّسْلِمُونَ,And Abraham enjoined upon his sons this and [so did] Jacob 'My sons God has chosen for you the [true] religion see that you die not save in submission.' He related that Abraham عليه السلام enjoined his sons as did Jacob عليه السلام who said “Do not let death come upon you except in the state of submission islām.” Their laws even if they differed in details were of one origin. The spring of unity tawḥīd is not divided into two. words of God most high “God has chosen for you the [true] religion” were good news. By [these words] their desire to meet the demands of submission islām became strong. For when they realized that God سبحانه had chosen them for that [islām] they knew with certainty that He would help them and make it easy for them to uphold the rightful due of submission islām.
أَمْ كُنتُمْ شُهَدَآءَ إِذْ حَضَرَ يَعْقُوبَ ٱلْمَوْتُ إِذْ قَالَ لِبَنِيهِ مَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن بَعْدِي قَالُواْ نَعْبُدُ إِلَـٰهَكَ وَإِلَـٰهَ آبَائِكَ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَإِسْمَاعِيلَ وَإِسْحَاقَ إِلَـٰهاً وَاحِداً وَنَحْنُ لَهُ مُسْلِمُونَ,Or were you witnesses when death came to Jacobḍ When he said to his sons “What will you worship after meḍ” They said “We will worship your God All of them ḍ followed one way in declaring [God's] oneness tawḥīd and submission islām. They inherited that one after another from their forefathers and [they] were the people of the house of intimacy deserving of nearness and purified in truth by God. and the God of your fathers Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac One God to Him we submit.” [Jacob's sons] did not say “Our God” out of respect for [Jacob's] special status inasmuch as they accepted his superiority and saw themselves as attached to his station maqām. [Rather] they said of themselves that they were followers of [Abraham Ishmael and Isaac] when they said “and to Him we submit.”
تِلْكَ أُمَّةٌ قَدْ خَلَتْ لَهَا مَا كَسَبَتْ وَلَكُمْ مَّا كَسَبْتُمْ وَلاَ تُسْأَلُونَ عَمَّا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ,That is a community that has passed away; theirs is what they have earned and yours is what you have earned; you will not be asked about what they did. The Real سبحانه sent down to each [community] its place and singled out for each one its status according to His decree ḥukm. There is no news about their outward forms and no trace remaining of what distinguished each group from the others. Each is a king in his own region and each has a celestial sphere revolving in felicity.
وَقَالُواْ كُونُواْ هُوداً أَوْ نَصَارَىٰ تَهْتَدُواْ قُلْ بَلْ مِلَّةَ إِبْرَاهِيمَ حَنِيفاً وَمَا كَانَ مِنَ ٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ,And they say “Be Jews or Christians and you will be guided.” Say “Nay rather the creed of Abraham a ḥanīf; and he was not of the idolaters.” [That is] “When the groups contended with you [Muḥammad] they demanded that you agree muwāfaqa with them. Stand firm in opposing that to which they call you and turn your attention increasingly to Us. Follow the way of the Friend al-khalīl in withdrawing from the group whether it be one's own father or anyone else who is not in accord lā yuwāfiqu with his Protector.” Thus he said “And I shall shun you and that which you call upon besides God” [19:48]. The ḥanīf is the “one who leans” toward the straight truth on the path the truth free from any defect of creation. [He is] in agreement wāfiq with the truth by the Truth.
قُولُوۤاْ آمَنَّا بِٱللَّهِ وَمَآ أُنْزِلَ إِلَيْنَا وَمَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَىٰ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَإِسْمَاعِيلَ وَإِسْحَاقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ وَٱلأَسْبَاطِ وَمَآ أُوتِيَ مُوسَىٰ وَعِيسَىٰ وَمَا أُوتِيَ ٱلنَّبِيُّونَ مِن رَّبِّهِمْ لاَ نُفَرِّقُ بَيْنَ أَحَدٍ مِّنْهُمْ وَنَحْنُ لَهُ مُسْلِمُونَ,Say: “We believe in God and in that which has been revealed to us and revealed to Abraham Ishmael Isaac Jacob and the tribes and that which was given to Moses and Jesus and the prophets from their Lord we make no division between any of them and to Him we submit.” Because our Prophet ﷺ believed in everything that was revealed before him he was honored with everything that [God] had conferred in honor to [the prophets] before him. When [God] proclaimed the harmony muwāfaqa of all [the messages of the prophets] He entrusted everything in existence [to fall] under [Muḥammad's] banner. [Muḥammad] said “Adam and all others shall be under my banner on the Day of the Resurrection.” When his community believed in everything that God revealed to His messengers and made no division between any of them they drew the highest share in honor and took precedence over all communities.
فَإِنْ آمَنُواْ بِمِثْلِ مَآ آمَنْتُمْ بِهِ فَقَدِ ٱهْتَدَواْ وَّإِن تَوَلَّوْاْ فَإِنَّمَا هُمْ فِي شِقَاقٍ فَسَيَكْفِيكَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ وَهُوَ ٱلسَّمِيعُ ٱلْعَلِيمُ,And if they believe in the like of what you believe in then they are truly guided; but if they turn away then they are clearly in schism; God will suffice you against them; He is the Hearer the Knower. [That is] “If they travel your path and adopt your way they will be honored with what you have been honored with and they will attain what you have attained. If they insist on making a distinction [between the prophets] We will insist on their abasement. Surely We stand by those who serve you O Muḥammad in unity and We will inevitably turn away from those who differ with you and oppose you. Whoever opposes you is on the side of the enemies and whoever serves you is on the side of the friends.” God will suffice you against them. He is the Hearer the Knower: The suf- ficiency of God is shown to be true kifāyat Allāh mutaḥaqqiqa because the solicitude of God is tied to you li-anna ʿināyat Allāh bi-kum mutaʿalliqa. Whoever acts adversely toward you My helping hands will crush [them] fa-man nābadhakum qaṣamathu ayādī l-nuṣra and whoever opposes you matters of fate will subjugate [them] wa-man khālafakum qaharathu qaḌāyā l-qisma. He is the Hearer of the ongoing conversation whispered between your innermost selves and Us li-munājāti asrārikum maʿnā ʿalā waṣfi al-dawām [He is] the Knower of [the extent to which] you deserve the special favors of kindness and honor from Us bi-stiḥqāqikum minnā khaṣāÌiṣi al-luṬfi wa-l-ikrām.
صِبْغَةَ ٱللَّهِ وَمَنْ أَحْسَنُ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ صِبْغَةً وَنَحْنُ لَهُ عَابِدونَ,The mark of God; and who has a better mark than Godḍ And Him we worship. Its meaning is “They have been attached to the mark ṣibgha of God.” [The word “mark”] is in the accusative because of the implied verb. The allusion [in the verse] is that the lesson [about the true religion] is written by the Real not the servant [such as those who say “Be Jews or Christians and you shall be guided”]. What humankind pretends will pass away in the end while what the Real has firmly established is the primordial nature al-fiṬra [and] His establishment of it is the lesson. The hearts have a mark the spirits have a mark the innermost selves have a mark and the outward selves have a mark. The mark of corporeal and outward selves is in the traces of [God-granted] success ṣibghatu al-ashbāḥi wa-l-ẓawāhiri bi-āthāri al-tawfīq and the mark of the spirits and innermost secrets is in the lights of realization wa-ṣibghatu al-arwāḥi wa-l-sarāÌiri bi-anwāri al-taḥqīq.
قُلْ أَتُحَآجُّونَنَا فِي اللَّهِ وَهُوَ رَبُّنَا وَرَبُّكُمْ وَلَنَآ أَعْمَالُنَا وَلَكُمْ أَعْمَالُكُمْ وَنَحْنُ لَهُ مُخْلِصُونَ,Say: “Would you then dispute with us concerning God and He is our Lord and your Lordḍ Our deeds belong to us and to you belong your deeds and to Him we are sincerely devoted.” How can dispute with strangers be appropriate when they are covered by absence and shaded by concealment while the friends are lit by unveiling and the bright noon of witnessingḍ When is the state of one who is bankrupt by his absence equal to one whose selection and sincere devotion [and] immersion in acts of drawing near to Him has [already been] decreedḍ It is preposterous-there is no equality!
أَمْ تَقُولُونَ إِنَّ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَإِسْمَاعِيلَ وَإِسْحَـاقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ وَالأَسْبَاطَ كَانُواْ هُوداً أَوْ نَصَارَىٰ قُلْ أَأَنْتُمْ أَعْلَمُ أَمِ ٱللَّهُ وَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّنْ كَتَمَ شَهَادَةً عِندَهُ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ وَمَا ٱللَّهُ بِغَافِلٍ عَمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ,Or do you say: “Abraham Ishmael Isaac and Jacob and the tribes- they were Jews or they were Christiansḍ” Say: “Have you then greater knowl- edge or has Godḍ And who does greater injustice than he who conceals a testimony received from Godḍ And God is not heedless of what you do.” Whoever looks from himself to creation forms an image of each thing based on his own character and considers everything to be something like him. When they by virtue of being outsiders [to the Real] judged the prophets [عليه السلام] according to their own state the Real سبحانه threw their conjecture back upon them and left them with their own opinion. Are those who have been drawn away from their own testimony like those who are veiled by itḍ Is the one who is snatched away from all of it equal to the one who is thrown back to what is like himḍ That is the conjecture of those who disbelieve-what misery is theirs!
تِلْكَ أُمَّةٌ قَدْ خَلَتْ لَهَا مَا كَسَبَتْ وَلَكُمْ مَّا كَسَبْتُمْ وَلاَ تُسْأَلُونَ عَمَّا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ,That is a community that has passed away; theirs is what they have earned and yours is what you have earned; you will not be asked about what they did. The barriers of fate came between you and them for they built their struc- tures on separation and heedlessness while you have pitched your tents on closeness and connection. The freedman of Our favor ʿatīq faḌlinā is not like the fugitive of Our force Ṭarīd qahrinā.
سَيَقُولُ ٱلسُّفَهَآءُ مِنَ ٱلنَّاسِ مَا وَلَّٰهُمْ عَن قِبْلَتِهِمُ ٱلَّتِي كَانُواْ عَلَيْهَا قُل للَّهِ ٱلْمَشْرِقُ وَٱلْمَغْرِبُ يَهْدِي مَن يَشَآءُ إِلَىٰ صِرَاطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ,The fools among the people will say “What has turned them from the direction they used to face in their prayersḍ” The eyes of the disbelievers were weak so the correct view about all the circumstances of the believers was not apparent to them. They looked with an eye to finding ugliness and let loose their tongues to oppose everything that was and would be from [the believers]. They did not see anything new without bringing forth a new objection to it. That included the change in the matter of the qibla when it was shifted to the Kaʿba. They said that if their qibla was correct what would turn them from itḍ So [God] said: Say: “To God belong the East and the West. He guides whomever He will to a straight path.” The servants worship toward any region and direction they will. Similarly the companions of absence and those who are veiled from witnessing [the way in which] the Real grants free agency to His friends seek only certain aspects of the affair and bring their own states to bear upon them. If they had seen the whole picture with singular vision they would have been saved from the pain of divisive thinking the distraction of accursed thoughts and the claims of fractured conjecture but God guides whom He wills to His light.
وَكَذَلِكَ جَعَلْنَاكُمْ أُمَّةً وَسَطاً لِّتَكُونُواْ شُهَدَآءَ عَلَى ٱلنَّاسِ وَيَكُونَ ٱلرَّسُولُ عَلَيْكُمْ شَهِيداً وَمَا جَعَلْنَا ٱلْقِبْلَةَ ٱلَّتِي كُنتَ عَلَيْهَآ إِلاَّ لِنَعْلَمَ مَن يَتَّبِعُ ٱلرَّسُولَ مِمَّن يَنقَلِبُ عَلَىٰ عَقِبَيْهِ وَإِن كَانَتْ لَكَبِيرَةً إِلاَّ عَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ هَدَى ٱللَّهُ وَمَا كَانَ ٱللَّهُ لِيُضِيعَ إِيمَانَكُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ بِٱلنَّاسِ لَرَءُوفٌ رَّحِيمٌ,Thus We appointed you a community of the middle way that you might be witnesses to the people; and that the Messenger might be a witness to you The middle way is the best and He appointed this community the best of communities. He appointed this group ṬāÌifa the best of this com- munity for they are the best of the best. Just as this community will be witnesses over the communities at the resurrection so this group are the [foundational] roots uṣūl around which [the community] turns: they are the pole quṬb and through them God protects the entire community. Whomever their hearts accept is accepted and whomever their hearts reject is rejected-the judgment ḥukm is theirs.Their inward perception firāsa is sincere and true their judgment is sound and their reflective thought naẓar is correct; [they are] a protection for the entire community from agreeing on error. The protection of this group from error comes from [their] consideration and judgment [their] acceptance and rejection. Moreover the building of their affair rests upon the way sunna of the Messenger ﷺ. Anything which is not an emulation of the Messenger عليه السلام is a rejection of him and its follower has nothing. We did not appoint the direction you were facing except that We might know who followed the Messenger from him who turned on his heels-though it were a grave thing save for those whom God has guided; but God would never cause your faith to be wasted; truly God is Gentle with people Merciful. [God] explained that the decree in determining the matter of the qibla up to the time of the change and then at the time of the substitution was a test for them from the Real in order to distinguish the sincere ṣādiq from the one who reneges māriq. To those who viewed the matter with the eye of separation ʿayn al-tafriqa the change was intolerable. To those who looked with the eye of reality ʿayn al-ḥaqīqa the true sense appeared to their inner sight baṣīra. Then He said “but God would never cause your faith to be wasted.” That is for those who are with God in all [their] states with one heart the differences in their states are one whether He causes change or stillness makes firm or shifts confirms or changes-they are through Him for Him in all [their] states. The one who spoke for them said: However the glass turns we turn. The ignorant think we have become crazed. Whether they face the east or west whether they turn toward a stone or approach dry earth the goal of their hearts is one and what belongs to the One so the decree of everything in it is one.
قَدْ نَرَىٰ تَقَلُّبَ وَجْهِكَ فِي ٱلسَّمَآءِ فَلَنُوَلِّيَنَّكَ قِبْلَةً تَرْضَاهَا فَوَلِّ وَجْهَكَ شَطْرَ ٱلْمَسْجِدِ ٱلْحَرَامِ وَحَيْثُ مَا كُنْتُمْ فَوَلُّواْ وُجُوِهَكُمْ شَطْرَهُ وَإِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ ٱلْكِتَابَ لَيَعْلَمُونَ أَنَّهُ ٱلْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّهِمْ وَمَا ٱللَّهُ بِغَافِلٍ عَمَّا يَعْمَلُونَ,We have indeed seen you turning your face about in the heaven; now We will surely turn you to a direction qibla that will satisfy you. Turn your face toward the sacred mosque and wherever you are turn your faces toward it. [Muḥammad] ﷺ maintained [his] good manners when he kept his tongue silent from requesting the qibla he wished for in his heart. So he looked to the heaven because it is the path of Gabriel عليه السلام and God سبحانه وتعالى revealed “We have indeed seen you turning your face about in the heaven” that is “We know the wish you have not expressed in prayer and We have already changed the qibla for your sake. This is an extraordinary thing that the Beloved does for the sake of the beloved.” “We shall surely turn you to a direction that will satisfy you: Every servant strives in seeking My pleasure and I am seeking your pleasure [Muḥammad]. Turn your face toward the sacred mosque but do not attach your heart to the stones and leftover traces āthār: devote your heart to Me. Let the qibla be the goal of your [outward] self and [let] the Real [be] the object of your heart's witnessing. Wherever you are O believers turn your faces toward it but dedicate your hearts to Me and let your witnessing be only through Me.” Those who have been given the scripture know that it is the truth from their Lord; God is not heedless of what they do. “But it is not knowledge that will be a proof for them nor is there any comfort for them in it or increase from it. God is not heedless of what you do in bringing fear to the enemies and providing hope for the friends tahwīlan ʿalā l-aʿdāÌi wa taÌmīlan ʿalā l-awliyāÌi.”
وَلَئِنْ أَتَيْتَ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ ٱلْكِتَابَ بِكُلِّ آيَةٍ مَّا تَبِعُواْ قِبْلَتَكَ وَمَآ أَنتَ بِتَابِعٍ قِبْلَتَهُمْ وَمَا بَعْضُهُم بِتَابِعٍ قِبْلَةَ بَعْضٍ وَلَئِنِ ٱتَّبَعْتَ أَهْوَاءَهُم مِّن بَعْدِ مَا جَآءَكَ مِنَ ٱلْعِلْمِ إِنَّكَ إِذَاً لَّمِنَ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ,Yet if you should bring to those who have been given the scripture every sign they will not follow your direction and you are not a follower of their direction; neither are they followers of one another's direction. If you were to follow their whims after the knowledge that has come to you then you will surely be among the evildoers. “Devotion to the path of the Real was already yours from the eternal decree [just as it was decreed] that your enemies would fall to the side. Between the two of you there is a barrier barzakh. They do not overstep [55:19-20]. They will not follow your qibla even if you were to show them evidence that was clearer than suns and moons. And you will not be followers of their qibla even if they bring every stratagem. In that there is a decree from God سبحانه from pre-eternity.”
ٱلَّذِينَ آتَيْنَاهُمُ ٱلْكِتَابَ يَعْرِفُونَهُ كَمَا يَعْرِفُونَ أَبْنَاءَهُمْ وَإِنَّ فَرِيقاً مِّنْهُمْ لَيَكْتُمُونَ ٱلْحَقَّ وَهُمْ يَعْلَمُونَ,Those to whom We have given the Scripture they recognize him as they recognize their sons; even though there is a party of them that conceal the truth while they know. Their hidden envy causes haughtiness in them concerning what they necessarily know. Similarly whoever has been defeated in the darknesses of his lower self throws off the cloak of bashfulness. There is no use censuring him; words will not rein in his abandon.
ٱلْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّكَ فَلاَ تَكُونَنَّ مِنَ ٱلْمُمْتَرِينَ,The truth comes from your Lord; then be not among the doubters. i.e. 'after the suns of certainty have appeared to you do not yield to the results of mere guessing'. The address is to [the Prophet] but what is intended by it is the community.
وَلِكُلٍّ وِجْهَةٌ هُوَ مُوَلِّيهَا فَٱسْتَبِقُواْ ٱلْخَيْرَاتِ أَيْنَ مَا تَكُونُواْ يَأْتِ بِكُمُ ٱللَّهُ جَمِيعاً إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,Every person has his direction to which he turns so vie with one another in good works. Wherever you may be God will bring you all together; surely God has power over all things. 'The allusion in it is to the fact that every people are distracted from Us by something that comes between them and Us. So be you O believers for Us and through Us'. One of them recited: When preoccupation with their concern distracted me from you I made you my preoccupation and you made me forget my concern.
وَمِنْ حَيْثُ خَرَجْتَ فَوَلِّ وَجْهَكَ شَطْرَ ٱلْمَسْجِدِ ٱلْحَرَامِ وَإِنَّهُ لَلْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّكَ وَمَا ٱللَّهُ بِغَافِلٍ عَمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ,From whatever place you issue turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque; it is the truth from your Lord. God is not heedless of what you do. 'Just as you face the qibla from wherever you are whether you are near or far from it likewise draw near to Us in your heart whatever your state whether you are in good fortune from Us or afflicted'.
وَمِنْ حَيْثُ خَرَجْتَ فَوَلِّ وَجْهَكَ شَطْرَ ٱلْمَسْجِدِ ٱلْحَرَامِ وَحَيْثُ مَا كُنْتُمْ فَوَلُّواْ وُجُوهَكُمْ شَطْرَهُ لِئَلاَّ يَكُونَ لِلنَّاسِ عَلَيْكُمْ حُجَّةٌ إِلاَّ ٱلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ مِنْهُمْ فَلاَ تَخْشَوْهُمْ وَٱخْشَوْنِي وَلأُتِمَّ نِعْمَتِي عَلَيْكُمْ وَلَعَلَّكُمْ تَهْتَدُونَ,From whatever place you issue turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque; and wherever you may be turn your faces towards it so that there be not any argument from the people against you; excepting the evildoers among them; 'If you want there to be no pathway for anyone against you no shadow to fall upon you from any created thing and no hand to reach you with evil then from whatever place you issue ḥaythumā kunta whithersoever you are aynamā kunta and whatever state you are in kayfamā kunta be for Us kun lanā and be from Us wa kun minnā for truly whoever occupies themselves exclusively with Us - nothing can get to them'. [2:150 cont'd] and do not fear them but fear Me; 'When they are effaced from their engendered existence kawn as mortal remains rusūm Our decrees aḥkām flow over them so why should there be fear of themḍ' [2:150 cont'd] and that I may perfect My grace upon you and that you may be guided. The perfection of grace is to add unveiling kashf to kindness luṭf. The one whom He suffices through the exigency of His generosity jūd is below the one whom He enriches by the rightful due ḥaqq of His existence wujūd. Concerning the meaning of this they have recited: We are in the most perfect happiness but only through you is the happiness made complete. The [only] imperfection of what we are in O people of my love is that you are absent while we are present.
كَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَا فِيكُمْ رَسُولاً مِّنْكُمْ يَتْلُواْ عَلَيْكُمْ آيَاتِنَا وَيُزَكِّيكُمْ وَيُعَلِّمُكُمُ ٱلْكِتَابَ وَٱلْحِكْمَةَ وَيُعَلِّمُكُم مَّا لَمْ تَكُونُواْ تَعْلَمُونَ,As also We have sent among you of yourselves a messenger to recite Our verses to you and to purify you and to teach you the Book and wisdom and to teach you what you knew not. The sending of the Messenger was to open the gates of attainment for it was in His سبحانه prior knowledge that the hearts of His friends would be thirsty to meet Him. There is no way for anyone to [reach God] except through the intermediary of the messengers. By sending messengers He charged some people with the burdens [of prescriptive law] kulaf and by sending messengers to others He honored them with the arts of drawing near and approaching zulaf. What a difference between one people and another!
فَٱذْكُرُونِيۤ أَذْكُرْكُمْ وَٱشْكُرُواْ لِي وَلاَ تَكْفُرُونِ,So remember Me I will remember you; and be thankful to Me and be not ungrateful toward Me. Remembrance is the immersion of the one who is remembering in the witnessing shuhūd of that which is remembered and then [it is] being consumed in the existence wujūd of that which is being remembered until no trace athar remains of the remembering so that it is said “so and so” once was. So remember me I will remember you that is “be consumed in Our existence wujūd and We will remember you after your annihilation from yourself.” God most high said “For indeed formerly they had been virtu- ous” [51:16]. They were here for a time but they have become perpetually separate bānū dāÌiman: The world is a beautiful [passing] event so be a beautiful event for the one who is aware. The path of the people of literal expression ʿibāra is So remember me by acts of conformity muwāfaqāt [to the divine command] I will remember you with special gifts karāmāt. The path of the people of allu- sion ishāra is “So remember me in abandoning every worldly concern ḥaẓẓ I will remember you by raising you up in My reality ḥaqq after your annihilation from yourselves.” “So remember me by being content with Me instead of with My gifts and favors afḌāl and I will remember you by being pleased with you regard- less of your actions af ʿāl.” “So remember me-and it is by My remembrance of you that you remem- ber for without My prior remembrance your remembrance would not occur.” “So remember me by cutting off attachments ʿalāÌiq and I will remem- ber you by the attributes of realities ḥaqāÌiq.” It is said that “remember Me belongs to everyone you meet and I will remember you belongs to those whom I address.” Whoever remembers Me in a congregation I will remember him in a congregation better than theirs. It is said that “and be thankful to Me for the tremendous blessing to you [refers to when] I said to you 'So remember me I will remember you.'” It is said that gratitude is a kind of remembrance. In His words and be not ungrateful the prohibition against ingratitude kufrān is a com- mand to be grateful. Gratitude is a remembrance so He repeated for you the command to remember.
يَآأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ ٱسْتَعِينُواْ بِٱلصَّبْرِ وَٱلصَّلاَةِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ مَعَ ٱلصَّابِرِينَ,O you who believe seek help through patience and prayer; surely God is with the patient. “Seek the help of [God's] blessing ṣalāt through patience.”That is to say “your being worthy of your Lord's blessing ṣalāt [comes] by your patience at the flow of the decrees of the Real over you.” For that reason God most high said yet give good tidings to the patient [2:155] followed by Upon those rest blessings ṣalawāt and mercy from their Lord [2:157]. It is said that the patient are entitled to the ultimate treasures and the highest ranks inasmuch as they have attained the company maʿiyya of God most high who said “Surely God is with maʿa the patient.”
وَلاَ تَقُولُواْ لِمَنْ يُقْتَلُ فِي سَبيلِ ٱللَّهِ أَمْوَاتٌ بَلْ أَحْيَاءٌ وَلَكِن لاَّ تَشْعُرُونَ,And say not of those slain in God's way: “They are dead”; rather they are living; but you are not aware. Life passed away from them in this world but they have [already] arrived at eternal life in the end. They are in truth living finding all kinds of special gifts karāmāt from God. It is said that they are living because God is the One who takes over khalaf after them and anyone for whom God is the substitute is not dead. The one who spoke for them said about one who was created: Verily through you ʿItāb has departed for the sake of His way but he who remains belongs to Him. Like Khālid he has not died. It is said that they are living by God's remembrance of them. By the beauty of His eternal remembrance one who is the object of the Real's remembrance is not dead. It is said that verily their corporeal forms ashbāḥ are dispersed muta- farriqa but their spirits arwāḥ are proven true mutaḥaqqiqa through the Real سبحانه. If their corporeal forms have been annihilated through God their spirits have remained through God for whoever is annihilated through God his remaining is through God. It is said that they are living in the testimonial witnessings of exaltation the cloak of awe upon them. They are in the shade of intimacy delighted by His beauty in one moment and overwhelmed by His majesty in the next.
وَلَنَبْلُوَنَّكُمْ بِشَيْءٍ مِّنَ ٱلْخَوْفِ وَٱلْجُوعِ وَنَقْصٍ مِّنَ ٱلأَمَوَالِ وَٱلأَنفُسِ وَٱلثَّمَرَاتِ وَبَشِّرِ ٱلصَّابِرِينَ  *  ٱلَّذِينَ إِذَآ أَصَابَتْهُم مُّصِيبَةٌ قَالُواْ إِنَّا للَّهِ وَإِنَّـآ إِلَيْهِ رَاجِعُونَ,Surely We will try you with something of fear and hunger and diminu- tion of goods and lives and fruits; yet give good tidings to the patient; those who when they are struck by an affliction say “Surely we belong to God and to Him we will return.” He tried them with blessings in order to make their gratitude manifest and He tried them by tribulation in order to make their patience manifest. He caused that which was [already] known of their state to enter into exis- tence marked them with the record that He had decreed and established them with the attribute He [already] knew. He tried them with fear which cleared their breasts and by hunger which cleansed their bodies and by diminution of goods which purified their material blessings. Through the afflictions suffered by [their] lower selves their wages were magnified before God and through the blight of [their] fruits their compensation was doubled from God. Yet give good tidings to the patient meaning those who do not oppose His decree through what He brings to pass. It is said He asked them to fear in their seeking to avoid His punish- ment; then to suffer hunger in their desire for His nearness and generosity; then the dimunition of goods through almsgiving renouncing [the goods] in the hopes of something better which is obtaining knowledge of Him; and lives anfus through their submission to worship of Him; and fruits in abandoning their hope for abundant material blessings. Yet give good tidings to those who are patient in seeking the beautiful in His decree and yielding to the flow of His power. The demands of the unseen muṬālabāt al-ghayb will either be through wealth the self or near relations. Whoever devotes wealth to God will have salvation najāt. Whoever exerts [him]self for His decree will [be raised in] degrees darajāt. Whoever is patient with the misfortunes of near relations will have recompense and stations of nearness qurubāt. Whoever does not hoard the spirit from Him will have perpetual intimate communications muwāṣalāt. Those who when they are struck by an affliction face the matter with patience and even gratitude. Nay [they are] even exultant boastful. Whoever views things as property belonging to the Real sees himself as a stranger between Him and His decree for the One who brought forth creation has more right over created beings than they do themselves.

أُولَـٰئِكَ عَلَيْهِمْ صَلَوَاتٌ مِّن رَّبِّهِمْ وَرَحْمَةٌ وَأُولَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْمُهْتَدُونَ,Upon those rest blessings and mercy from their Lord and those-they are the truly guided. They attained their patience and their ability to withstand the demands of the divine decree from His prior blessings to them. It was not because of their patience or their endurance that they arrived at His blessings for if not for His pre-eternal mercy their obedience would not have arisen through the condition of servitude for His prior solicitude is what brought pure guidance to them. They are the truly guided: Because He blessed them in the beginning lammā raḥimahum fī l-bidāya they were guided in the end ihtadaw fī l-nihāya.
إِنَّ ٱلصَّفَا وَٱلْمَرْوَةَ مِن شَعَآئِرِ ٱللَّهِ فَمَنْ حَجَّ ٱلْبَيْتَ أَوِ ٱعْتَمَرَ فَلاَ جُنَاحَ عَلَيْهِ أَن يَطَّوَّفَ بِهِمَا وَمَن تَطَوَّعَ خَيْراً فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ شَاكِرٌ عَلِيمٌ,Truly ṣafā and Marwa are among the symbols of God These sites and relics tilka al-mashāhidu wa-l-rusūm these ruins and remains wa-tilka al-aṬlālu wa-l-ruqūm are extolled and visited. One sets out for them because they are the ruins of the lovers where the vestiges [still] gleam: The passions of houses belong to those who have lived in them. There is no concern or joy in the house itself. Truly the earth of their path even the dust of their footprints has tre- mendous value for the lovers. Even the smallest bit of dust that falls upon the edges of their path is more precious than the most fragrant musk: And that is only because Umayma walked beside it in a group [of women] trailing a garment. so whoever makes the pilgrimage to the House or the visitation he would not be at fault if he circumambulates them; and whoever volunteers good God is Grateful Knowing. ṣafā and Marwa were favored by being close to the House. The running between the two became part of the law just as the circumambulation became part of the law for the House. Just as the circumambulation is one of the main rites of the pilgrimage so is the running. The neighbor is honored for the sake of the neighbor.
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يَكْتُمُونَ مَآ أَنزَلْنَا مِنَ ٱلْبَيِّنَاتِ وَٱلْهُدَىٰ مِن بَعْدِ مَا بَيَّنَّاهُ لِلنَّاسِ فِي ٱلْكِتَابِ أُولَـٰئِكَ يَلعَنُهُمُ ٱللَّهُ وَيَلْعَنُهُمُ ٱللاَّعِنُونَ,Those who conceal the clear proofs and the guidance that We have revealed after We have shown them clearly in the scripture-they shall be cursed by God and by those who curse This verse alludes to those to whom the Real سبحانه has unveiled knowledge of the good manners ādāb of traveling but who have become stingy in revealing [this knowledge] to aspirants [who seek] advice and guidance. In that moment they become worthy of wrath. One fears for them that the blessing will be removed from their knowledge when they fall short in it just as they held back in imparting [that knowledge] to the deserving.
إِلاَّ ٱلَّذِينَ تَابُواْ وَأَصْلَحُواْ وَبَيَّنُواْ فَأُوْلَـئِكَ أَتُوبُ عَلَيْهِمْ وَأَنَا التَّوَّابُ الرَّحِيمُ,Except those that repent and make amends and show clearly-them I shall turn [relenting]; I am the Relenting the Merciful. [Except those who] compensate for their past negligence by graciously turning back taking on the task of giving advice to the aspirants. They show clearly to [the aspirants] the goodness in upholding certain modes of behavior explaining and demonstrating this to them in a beautiful way. Surely the clearest proof of the clarity of your actions and the truest tes- timony of that by which you call people to God is that your behavior does not contradict what you have alluded to in your speech. God most high said “And I do not desire to be inconsistent in what I forbid you” [11:88].
إِن الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا وَمَاتُوا وَهُمْ كُفَّارٌ أُولَئِكَ عَلَيْهِمْ لَعْنَةُ ٱللَّهِ وَٱلْمَلاۤئِكَةِ وَٱلنَّاسِ أَجْمَعِينَ  *  خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا لاَ يُخَفَّفُ عَنْهُمُ ٱلْعَذَابُ وَلاَ هُمْ يُنْظَرُونَ,But those who disbelieve and die disbelieving-upon them shall be the curse of God and the angels and of people altogether. Abiding therein: the chastisement shall not be lightened for them no respite shall be given them. Here the allusion is to those who after they have traveled the path of spiritual desire irāda find it fitting to return to the states of the people of habit ahl al-ʿāda.261 Then while they are in the grip of this estrange- ment [from the path] and in this condition [they] leave the world. Those are the companions of separation aṣḥāb al-furqa. There is no drawing near for their spirits or setting straight their calamity no asking for mercy from anyone. They have lost in this world and the hereafter. They are cursed by gnats in the air and stagnation in [their] water yalʿanuhum al-baqqu fī l-hawāÌi wa-l-naqʿu ʿalā l-māÌi. Abiding: that is they remain forever in their contemptible position insignificant and [find no] lessening of it or relief without kindness or favors.

وَإِلَـٰهُكُمْ إِلَـٰهٌ وَاحِدٌ لاَّ إِلَـٰهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ ٱلرَّحْمَـٰنُ ٱلرَّحِيمُ,Your God is One God; there is no god except Him the Compassionate the Merciful. He honored them with the greatest honor in saying “Your God.” The shaykhs of this group said that the sign of the one whom He has prepared for the elect of the elect is that He says to him “My servant”-and this is more perfect than that. His saying “Your God” connecting His reality to you is better than His connecting you to Himself. This is because His divin- ity for you is without defect while your existence for Him is as a servant with only your defects and harms to give in exchange. When did He say to you “Your God”ḍ Was it at the time of your obedience your movements and states of rest your essence or qualitiesḍ Nay it was before that in the eternity of eternity time without time or season outward marking or event. The One who: there is nothing similar that comes close to Him there is no resemblance that approaches Him there is no partner who is related to Him there is no companion who is on intimate terms with Him there is no associate who works hand in hand with Him there is no helper who assists Him and there is no combatant who opposes Him. [It is] the oneness of the Real the eternalness of the source the per- petuity of the Abiding the endlessness of Might and the sempiternity of the Essence. [He is] One in the might of His radiance singular in the majesty of His splendor alone in the omnipotence of His grandeur eternal in the authority of His might glorious in the beauty of His sovereignty. Whoever tries to speak at length describing Him becomes incapable of expression. If it were not for the fact that He is the Compassionate the Merciful then the servant would be destroyed when exposed to knowledge of Him at the first glimmer of the appearances of His might.
إِنَّ فِي خَلْقِ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَٱخْتِلاَفِ ٱللَّيْلِ وَٱلنَّهَارِ وَٱلْفُلْكِ ٱلَّتِي تَجْرِي فِي ٱلْبَحْرِ بِمَا يَنفَعُ ٱلنَّاسَ وَمَآ أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مِن مَّآءٍ فَأَحْيَا بِهِ ٱلأَرْضَ بَعْدَ مَوْتِهَا وَبَثَّ فِيهَا مِن كُلِّ دَآبَّةٍ وَتَصْرِيفِ ٱلرِّيَاحِ وَٱلسَّحَابِ ٱلْمُسَخَّرِ بَيْنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ وَٱلأَرْضِ لآيَاتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يَعْقِلُونَ,Surely in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alterna- tion of the night and day and the ships that run in the sea with what profits men and the water God sends down from the heaven with which He revives the earth after it is dead and He scatters abroad in it all manner of crawling thing; and the disposition of the winds and the clouds compelled between heaven and the earth-surely there are signs for a people who comprehend. He informed the hearts of the seekers among the rational thinkers aṣḥāb al-istidlāl and those who possess intellects arbāb al-ʿuqūl of the evi- dentiary proofs of His deliberative power the signs of His existence and the marks of His lordship which are the various kinds of His acts. He drew their attention to the different aspects of wisdom and evidentiary proofs of [divine] oneness waḥdāniyya. Along with these He established demonstrative proofs that are subtle in expression and aspects of the evi- dentiary proofs that are precise in allusion. For there is no entity arising out of nonexistence whether a person or ruins trace or vestige heaven or space air or water sun or moon drop or rain sand or stone star or tree that is not evidence of oneness waḥdāniyya and a means of access for those who direct themselves to His existence.
وَمِنَ ٱلنَّاسِ مَن يَتَّخِذُ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ أَندَاداً يُحِبُّونَهُمْ كَحُبِّ ٱللَّهِ وَٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ أَشَدُّ حُبّاً للَّهِ وَلَوْ يَرَى ٱلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوۤاْ إِذْ يَرَوْنَ ٱلْعَذَابَ أَنَّ ٱلْقُوَّةَ للَّهِ جَمِيعاً وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ شَدِيدُ ٱلْعَذَابِ,Yet there be people who take to themselves peers besides God loving them as God is loved These are people whom the Real سبحانه did not appoint as the people of love ahl al-maḥabba. He kept them occupied with the love of other things so that they were satisfied with loving everything that their lower selves desired. They were satisfied with worshiping something that was made for them and satisfied with loving something crafted for them that is other than Him but those who believe love God more ardently; If he were to see those who did evil when they see the chastisement that the might altogether belongs to God and that God is terrible in chastisement. What is intended here is not to recall the idol worshipers' love for other things but rather to praise the believers for their love. It is not necessary for you to increase your love so as to surpass the love of disbelievers for their idols; rather the lover wants to remember his beloved as much as he can and finds everything that comes from the beloved beautiful. It is said that the reason for the superiority of the love of believers for God over the love of the disbelievers for their idols is that the love of the latter is from like to like and it is expected that like will incline to like. But [the love of believers for God] is a love for One who is not like them and that is more precious and more worthy. It is said that [the disbelievers] love what they can see and there is noth- ing amazing about loving that which has been seen with one's own eyes. But the believers love the One who has come in between them and their seeing a cloak of grandeur on their faces. It is said that those who believe love God more ardently because they do not dissociate themselves from God even if He punishes them. The disbeliever dissociates himself from the idol and the idol from the disbe- liever just as God most high said “When those who were followed disown their followers” [2:166]. It is said that the love maḥabba of the believers comes from God's love for them for that is more perfect. God most high said whom He loves and who love Him [5:54] while their love for idols is a matter of whim hawā.
إِذْ تَبَرَّأَ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱتُّبِعُواْ مِنَ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱتَّبَعُواْ وَرَأَوُاْ ٱلْعَذَابَ وَتَقَطَّعَتْ بِهِمُ ٱلأَسْبَابُ,When those who were followed disown their followers and they have seen the chastisement and the cords are cut away before them. When the first parts of the punishment appear to [the disbelievers] it will become clear to them that they have nothing sincere upon which to stand. As for the believers they will have their lives possessions spouses and children taken from them [but their sincerity will remain]. [The disbeliev- ers] will be made to reside in the graves for a few years and then He will try them at the resurrection with lengthy terrors and by questioning [their] actions and then cast them in the fire. [But] He will grant [the believers] long days and lives so their love for Him will continue to increase. Because of that He said “those who believe love God more ardently” [2:165].
وَقَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱتَّبَعُواْ لَوْ أَنَّ لَنَا كَرَّةً فَنَتَبَرَّأَ مِنْهُمْ كَمَا تَبَرَّءُواْ مِنَّا كَذَلِكَ يُرِيهِمُ ٱللَّهُ أَعْمَالَهُمْ حَسَرَاتٍ عَلَيْهِمْ وَمَا هُم بِخَارِجِينَ مِنَ ٱلنَّارِ,And those who followed say “O if only we might return again and disown them as they have disowned us!” So God shall show them their works anguish for them! Never shall they exit from the Fire. At that time they will know the bitter taste of the companionship of created things but they will not be able to attain anything but anguish.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّاسُ كُلُواْ مِمَّا فِي ٱلأَرْضِ حَلاَلاً طَيِّباً وَلاَ تَتَّبِعُواْ خُطُوَاتِ ٱلشَّيْطَانِ إِنَّهُ لَكُمْ عَدُوٌّ مُّبِينٌ,O people eat of what is in the earth lawful and wholesome; and fol- low not the steps of Satan; he is a manifest foe to you; That which is forbidden even if it is pleasing now is contaminated in the end. That which is permitted even if it is hateful now is wholesome in the end. The pure and permitted [can be understood as] that which is acquired without forgetting the Real. It is said that that which is permitted is what the gatherer obtains for His sake and acquires while witnessing the Real in every state. Anything that causes you to forget the Real or disobey the Real is from the steps of Satan.
إِنَّمَا يَأْمُرُكُمْ بِٱلسُّوۤءِ وَٱلْفَحْشَآءِ وَأَن تَقُولُواْ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ مَا لاَ تَعْلَمُونَ,he only commands you to evil and indecency and that you should speak against God what you do not know. Because of his audacity toward God he induces you to speak falsely about God.
وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمُ ٱتَّبِعُوا مَآ أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ قَالُواْ بَلْ نَتَّبِعُ مَآ أَلْفَيْنَا عَلَيْهِ آبَآءَنَآ أَوَلَوْ كَانَ آبَاؤُهُمْ لاَ يَعْقِلُونَ شَيْئاً وَلاَ يَهْتَدُونَ,And when it is said to them “Follow what God has revealed” they say “No; but we follow what we found our fathers doing.” Whatḍ Even if their fathers do not understand anything and they were not guidedḍ There is no raising their eyes beyond that which is like them in form class kind and ancestry for they are set on their way. Without a doubt they have plunged into the fire on their path. Had they known that their ancestors had no intelligence to restrain them nor guidance to unite them they would have withdrawn from them [understanding them to be] hostile and resisted them [understanding them to be] oppositional [to God's com- mand]. But the lights of insight were snatched from them and they were deprived of the proofs of certainty.
وَمَثَلُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ كَمَثَلِ ٱلَّذِي يَنْعِقُ بِمَا لاَ يَسْمَعُ إِلاَّ دُعَآءً وَنِدَآءً صُمٌّ بُكْمٌ عُمْيٌ فَهُمْ لاَ يَعْقِلُونَ,The likeness of those who disbelieve is as the likeness of one who shouts to that which hears nothing save a call and a cry; deaf dumb blind-they do not comprehend. Without the ears of comprehension and acceptance their bodily hearing did not benefit them. They descended to the status of animals incapable of actualization taḥṣīl. Whoever is content to be like an animal man raḌiya an yakūn ka-l-bahīma does not have much worth lam yaqaʿu ʿalayhi kathīr al-qīma.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ كُلُواْ مِن طَيِّبَاتِ مَا رَزَقْنَاكُمْ وَٱشْكُرُواْ للَّهِ إِن كُنْتُمْ إِيَّاهُ تَعْبُدُونَ,O you who believe eat of the good things Ṭayyibāt wherewith We have provided you and give thanks to God if it be Him that you worship. The permitted ḥalāl is that for which there is no [bad] consequence. The good thing Ṭayyib is that thing whose blessing is not attributed to any created thing. When the servant finds something that combines these two qualities it is permitted and good. The true meaning of thankfulness to Him is that you do not take a breath in anything other than the pleasure of the Real so long as the energy given to you by that [permitted and good] food remains.
إِنَّمَا حَرَّمَ عَلَيْكُمُ ٱلْمَيْتَةَ وَٱلدَّمَ وَلَحْمَ ٱلْخِنزِيرِ وَمَآ أُهِلَّ بِهِ لِغَيْرِ ٱللَّهِ فَمَنِ ٱضْطُرَّ غَيْرَ بَاغٍ وَلاَ عَادٍ فَلاۤ إِثْمَ عَلَيْهِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,He has only forbidden you carrion blood the flesh of swine and what has been hallowed to other than God. Yet whoever is constrained not desiring nor transgressing no sin shall be on him. God is Forgiving Merciful. He has forbidden in outward circumstances these specific things which have been hallowed to other than God. He has forbidden to the innermost hearts companionship with other than God and even witnessing anything other than God. Yet whoever is constrained that is anyone who has not found a means to annihilation in the realities of the Real should only travel by way of the law. Either he should be effaced in God or stand by means of God or act for God. Otherwise he is a foolish man of no account.
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يَكْتُمُونَ مَآ أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ مِنَ ٱلْكِتَابِ وَيَشْتَرُونَ بِهِ ثَمَناً قَلِيلاً أُولَـٰئِكَ مَا يَأْكُلُونَ فِي بُطُونِهِمْ إِلاَّ ٱلنَّارَ وَلاَ يُكَلِّمُهُمُ ٱللَّهُ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ وَلاَ يُزَكِّيهِمْ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,Those who conceal what God has revealed of the scripture and sell it for a little price-they shall consume nothing in their bellies but the fire; God shall not speak to them on the Day of Resurrection neither purify them; and theirs is a painful chastisement. The scholars ʿulamāÌ are asked to spread the evidentiary proofs of knowl- edge while the friends awliyāÌ are commanded to preserve the trusts of the secret. If [the scholars] conceal the proofs of the different types of knowledge they will be bridled with a bridle of fire nār. By con- trast if [the friends] divulge even a sliver from the secret they [will be] immediately distanced from the secrets asrār and snatched away from the lights anwār they have been given. To each is a limit ḥadd and to each a command amr.
أُولَـٰئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱشْتَرَوُاْ ٱلضَّلاَلَةَ بِٱلْهُدَىٰ وَٱلْعَذَابَ بِٱلْمَغْفِرَةِ فَمَآ أَصْبَرَهُمْ عَلَى ٱلنَّارِ  *  ذَلِكَ بِأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ نَزَّلَ ٱلْكِتَابَ بِٱلْحَقِّ وَإِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱخْتَلَفُواْ فِي ٱلْكِتَابِ لَفِي شِقَاقٍ بَعِيدٍ,They are those who have bought error at the price of guidance and chastisement at the price of pardon; what makes them so patient for the fireḍ That is because God has revealed the Book with the truth; and those that are at variance regarding the Book are in schism far removed. Truly those that prefer the other ghayr over the unseen ghayb the cre- ation khalq over the Real ḥaqq the lower self nafs over intimacy uns [with God] how hard are their hearts ma aqsā qulūbahum how shameless what they love and seek wa-mā awqaḥa maḥbūbahum wa-maṬlūbahum how cheap their worth and how disgraceful for those who have eyes to see! That is because God has revealed the Book in truth and made its decree and rule come to pass in sincerity and brought them to that for which He prepared them and established them on the way He has fashioned for them.

لَّيْسَ ٱلْبِرَّ أَن تُوَلُّواْ وُجُوهَكُمْ قِبَلَ ٱلْمَشْرِقِ وَٱلْمَغْرِبِ وَلَـٰكِنَّ ٱلْبِرَّ مَنْ آمَنَ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلآخِرِ وَٱلْمَلاۤئِكَةِ وَٱلْكِتَابِ وَٱلنَّبِيِّينَ وَآتَى ٱلْمَالَ عَلَىٰ حُبِّهِ ذَوِي ٱلْقُرْبَىٰ وَٱلْيَتَامَىٰ وَٱلْمَسَاكِينَ وَٱبْنَ ٱلسَّبِيلِ وَٱلسَّآئِلِينَ وَفِي ٱلرِّقَابِ وَأَقَامَ ٱلصَّلاةَ وَآتَى ٱلزَّكَاةَ وَٱلْمُوفُونَ بِعَهْدِهِمْ إِذَا عَاهَدُواْ وَٱلصَّابِرِينَ فِي ٱلْبَأْسَآءِ وٱلضَّرَّآءِ وَحِينَ ٱلْبَأْسِ أُولَـٰئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ صَدَقُواْ وَأُولَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْمُتَّقُونَ,It is not piety that you turn your faces to the East and to the West. True piety is [that of] the one who believes in God and the Last Day and the angels and the Book and the prophets and who gives of his substance however cherished to kinsmen and orphans and the needy and the traveler and beggars and for slaves and who observes prayer and pays the alms and those who fulfill their covenant when they have engaged in a covenant those who endure with fortitude misfortune hardship and peril are the ones who are truthful and these are the ones who are fearful. The allusion is that external circumstances [such as which way one turns for the qibla] are not terribly important whereas information about God is precious. The copious recitation of litanies though greatly esteemed [as a devotional activity] is the business of old and weak people. Devotional acts of obedience even if they are powerful are what ordinary people do. Spending night and day in an abundance of tasks and exertions has great weight in becoming worthy of the reward but deep knowledge of the Real is rare and precious. What is mentioned in this verse about different kinds of goodness iḥsān and aspects of faith īmān-the giving of wealth the purification of works the connection to kin holding to different types of protective arrangements and obligations the fulfillment of contracts and observing the limits-is of momentous effect and great significance. These [acts] are beloved maḥbūb to the Real as a law sharʿan and what He asks for maṬlūb as a command amran. But more perfect and higher in meaning is the standing in of the Real for you after your annihilation being effaced from yourself as a witness shāhid consumed in the existence of eter- nity with your outward characteristics rusūm cut off from the familiar things musākanāt of your sensory awareness iḥsās. [It is more perfect and higher in meaning] because in unity tawḥīd no impression or trace remains and no other thing or remnant is left behind.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ كُتِبَ عَلَيْكُمُ ٱلْقِصَاصُ فِي ٱلْقَتْلَى ٱلْحُرُّ بِالْحُرِّ وَٱلْعَبْدُ بِٱلْعَبْدِ وَٱلأُنثَىٰ بِٱلأُنْثَىٰ فَمَنْ عُفِيَ لَهُ مِنْ أَخِيهِ شَيْءٌ فَٱتِّبَاعٌ بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ وَأَدَآءٌ إِلَيْهِ بِإِحْسَانٍ ذٰلِكَ تَخْفِيفٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَرَحْمَةٌ فَمَنِ ٱعْتَدَىٰ بَعْدَ ذٰلِكَ فَلَهُ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,O you who believe prescribed for you is retaliation regarding the slain; a free man for a free man and a slave for a slave and a female for a female. But if anything is pardoned anyone in relation to his brother let the pursuit be honorable. And let the payment to him be with kindliness; that is an alleviation given by your Lord and a mercy; and for him who commits aggression after that-his is a painful chastisement. The right to retaliate is prescribed in the law but forgiveness is better so he who inclines to receiving his right in full is one who submits muslim while he who renounces seeking his right is one who acts in a beautiful way muḥsin. The first possesses worship and even servanthood ʿubūdiyya. The second possesses noble-heartedness futuwwa and even freedom ḥurriyya. According to the people of knowledge ahl al-ʿilm retaliation entails bloodshed. According to the allusion of the people of the story ahl al-qiṣṣa their blood goes unavenged and their lives are good for nothing. He said: The heart you caused to tremble gives praise to you and the blood you made spill is proud to have been spilled by you. The blood of the lovers shed over the carpet of nearness is the per- fume of the people of communion. The Prophet ﷺ said “The color is the color of blood and the smell is the smell of musk.”
وَلَكُمْ فِي ٱلْقِصَاصِ حَيَٰوةٌ يٰأُولِي ٱلأَلْبَابِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ,In retaliation there is life for you O people of pith so that you might fear. In carrying out the retaliation there is life because when one knows that if he kills he will himself be killed he refrains from killing. In this there is life for the one who kills and the one who is killed. But according to the allusive explanation there is greater life in aban- doning retaliation because when one has been annihilated in Him سبحانه He is the successor for him and his life from Him is more perfect for him than his remaining with himself. When God has inherited from them and succeeded them the remaining of the Successor is dearer than the life of the one who was annihilated.
كُتِبَ عَلَيْكُمْ إِذَا حَضَرَ أَحَدَكُمُ ٱلْمَوْتُ إِن تَرَكَ خَيْراً ٱلْوَصِيَّةُ لِلْوَالِدَيْنِ وَٱلأَقْرَبِينَ بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ حَقّاً عَلَى ٱلْمُتَّقِينَ,Prescribed for you when any of you is approached by death and leaves behind some good is to make testament in favor of his parents and kinsmen honorably-an obligation on those that fear. The testament regarding one's wealth is recommended for anyone who has wealth to leave behind. But if one leaves nothing behind what is the use of a testamentḍ The circumstance of the wealthy is such that they bequeath it in thirds at the end of their lives. The friends depart from their living entirely and therefore leave nothing but an aspiration himma which has become separated from them and detached from anything. Because there is no way for the aspiration to [reach] the Real and [because it no longer has] an attachment to anything [the aspiration] remains alone separate and disconnected.They have recited: As long as I am living I will love you and when I die my decaying bones will keep loving you in the ground. This is their testament. And it is even as another of them said: The traces tell that they left not long ago. They returned to their lands and my tears flowed for them.
فَمَن بَدَّلَهُ بَعْدَ مَا سَمِعَهُ فَإِنَّمَا إِثْمُهُ عَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ يُبَدِّلُونَهُ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ,Then if anyone changes it after hearing it the sin shall rest upon those who change it; surely God is Hearing Knowing. Whoever distorts an utterance the evil and harm of that becomes his. His punishment is that he is denied the smell of the fragrance of sincerity. Whoever aids the religion dīn God aids him and whoever provides aid against the religion God forsakes him.
فَمَنْ خَافَ مِن مُّوصٍ جَنَفاً أَوْ إِثْماً فَأَصْلَحَ بَيْنَهُمْ فَلاَ إِثْمَ عَلَيْهِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,But if anyone fears injustice or sin from one making a testament and so makes things right between them then no sin shall be upon him; surely God is Forgiving Merciful. Here the allusion is to the one who recognizes a weakness in one of the aspirants murīdūn or sees in one of the novices ahl al-bidāya a laxity of purpose qaṣd. Or [it may allude to] someone giving counsel [who] speaks with pure sincerity to someone who does not have the capacity for it. He understands his kindness to the aspirant as a form of indulgence encouragement persuasion and permissiveness toward him. This is not objectionable for urging people to pure sincerity [on the path] and [encour- aging them] in what is not yet firmly established in them has an ample reward. Showing kindness to novices who are not yet firm in their resolve or sincere in their effort is a crucial element in seeking to make things right.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ كُتِبَ عَلَيْكُمُ ٱلصِّيَامُ كَمَا كُتِبَ عَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ,O you who believe prescribed for you is the fast just as it was pre- scribed for those that were before you so that you might guard yourselves. Fasting ṣawm is of two types: the external fast which is abstention from things that break the fast mufṬarāt accompanied by the intention [to fast] and the inner fast which is to protect ṣawn the heart from dif- ferent kinds of harm āfāt then to protect the spirit from familiar com- forts musākanāt and then to protect the inner self from considerations mulāḥaẓāt [of anything but God]. It is said that the requirement of the fasting of worshipers if it is to be complete is to protect the tongue from slander ghība and to protect the glance from viewing [anything] with suspicion rība as it is said in the tradition “Whoever fasts let him fast with his ears his eyes....” As for the fast of those with deep knowledge it is to guard the innermost self from witnessing anything other than Him. For those who abstain from the things that break the fast the end of their fast [comes] when night falls. For those who fast from everything other [than Him] the end of their fast [comes when] they witness the Real. [The Prophet] ﷺ said “Fast to see Him and break your fast to see Him.” According to the people of realization ahl al-taḥqīq [in this ḥadīth the letter] hāÌ in [the Prophet's] words li-ruÌyatihi refers to the Real سبحانه.289 The religious scholars ʿulamāÌ say its meaning is “Fast when you see the new moon of RamaḌān and break your fast when you see the new moon of Shawwāl.” As for the elect their fast is for God because their witnessing is of God their breaking of the fast is through God and their approach is to God. The One who prevails over them is God and the One through whom they are effaced is God.
أَيَّاماً مَّعْدُودَاتٍ فَمَن كَانَ مِنكُم مَّرِيضاً أَوْ عَلَىٰ سَفَرٍ فَعِدَّةٌ مِّنْ أَيَّامٍ أُخَرَ وَعَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ يُطِيقُونَهُ فِدْيَةٌ طَعَامُ مِسْكِينٍ فَمَن تَطَوَّعَ خَيْراً فَهُوَ خَيْرٌ لَّهُ وَأَن تَصُومُواْ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ إِن كُنْتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ,For days numbered; and if any of you be sick or be on a journey then a number of other days; Whoever is present in the month fasts for God and whoever is present with the Creator of the month fasts through God. The fast for God leads to recompense while the fast through God leads to nearness. The fast for God is the fulfillment of worship taḥqīq al-ʿibāda and the fast through God is the healing of spiritual desire taṣḥīḥ al-irāda. The fast for God is an attribute of every worshiper ʿābid and the fast by means of God is the quality of every seeker qāṣid. The fast for God is accomplished by the outward ẓawāhir [selves] and the fast by means of God is accomplished by the innermost ḌamāÌir selves. The fast for God is abstention according to the clear explanations of the law ʿibārāt al-sharīʿa and the fast by means of God is abstention through the allusions of reality ishārāt al-ḥaqīqa. Whoever is present in the month [of RamaḌān] abstains from the things that break the fast while whoever is present with the Real abstains at all times from witnessing created things. Whoever fasts with his lower self will drink from the drink of Salsabīl and Zanjabīl. Whoever fasts in his heart will drink from the drink of that which causes love maḥābb through the blessing of [God's] approval ījāb. Those who fast with their innermost selves are those about whom God has said “He will give them a pure drink to drink” [76:21]. What a drink! [It is] a not a drink that is turned about in the hand but rather one that appears from [God's] kindness. [It is] a drink of becoming intimate not a drink from a cup. God most high said “If any of you be sick or be on a journey then a number of other days” that is for anyone who breaks the fast for these reasons [they should] fast a number of other days equaling those in which the fast was broken. The allusion is to one who is losing the vigor of his spiritual desire irāda so that he returns to other than Him either through a permissive interpretation rukhṣat taÌwīl or because of a lack of strength or endurance or a weakness in taking on the burdens of the decrees of reality aḥkām al-ḥaqīqa.
شَهْرُ رَمَضَانَ ٱلَّذِيۤ أُنْزِلَ فِيهِ ٱلْقُرْآنُ هُدًى لِّلنَّاسِ وَبَيِّنَاتٍ مِّنَ ٱلْهُدَىٰ وَٱلْفُرْقَانِ فَمَن شَهِدَ مِنكُمُ ٱلشَّهْرَ فَلْيَصُمْهُ وَمَن كَانَ مَرِيضاً أَوْ عَلَىٰ سَفَرٍ فَعِدَّةٌ مِّنْ أَيَّامٍ أُخَرَ يُرِيدُ ٱللَّهُ بِكُمُ ٱلْيُسْرَ وَلاَ يُرِيدُ بِكُمُ ٱلْعُسْرَ وَلِتُكْمِلُواْ ٱلْعِدَّةَ وَلِتُكَبِّرُواْ ٱللَّهَ عَلَىٰ مَا هَدَاكُمْ وَلَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ,The month of RamaḌān in which the QurÌān was revealed a guidance for the people and as clear proofs of the guidance and the criterion; So let those of you who are present [at his home] at the month fast it and if any of you be sick or if he be on a journey then a number of other days. RamaḌān burns yurmiḌu the sins dhunūb of some people and burns the outward characteristics rusūm of other people. What a difference between those whose sins are burned by His mercy and those whose out- ward characteristics are burned by His reality! The month of RamaḌān is the month of the opening of the [divine] speech khiṬāb the month of the revelation of the Book kitāb the month of obtaining the reward thawāb the month of drawing near and [gain- ing God's] approval ījāb the month of the lightening of burdens takhfīf al-kulfa the month of achieving intimacy taḥqīq al-zulfa the month of descending mercy nuzūl al-raḥma the month of granting blessing wufūr al-niʿma the month of salvation najāt and the month of intimate conversation munājāt. God desires ease for you and desires not hardship for you Part of His desiring ease for you is knowing that He desires ease for you. Among the signs that He desires ease for His servant is that He has brought about the search for ease for if [God] had not desired ease for [His ser- vant] He would not have placed a desire for it in him. The one who spoke for them said: If You had not wanted me to obtain that for which I hope and seek from Your generosity You would not have taught me to seek. [God] made hope [for ease] appropriate and confirmed the longing [for it]. He enjoined this inasmuch as He said “and He desires not hardship for you.” This was to negate the possibilities of other ways of thinking leaving the true sense clearly spelled out. and that you fulfill the number According to the language of scholars lisān al-ʿilm [it is] that you fulfill the number [of days] of the fast. According to the language of allusion lisān al-ishāra [it is] “that in the happiness of the present moment ṣafāÌ al-ḥāl you should be aware of the fulfillment of the end wafāÌ al-maÌāl.” and magnify God for having guided you and that you might be thankful [Thankful] in the final breath and that you might leave the numbered [days] of your life in the security salāma of your faith. [God's] granting of suc- cess tawfīq in completing the fast of the month is immensely important but it is even greater to have your life sealed with felicity.
وَإِذَا سَأَلَكَ عِبَادِي عَنِّي فَإِنِّي قَرِيبٌ أُجِيبُ دَعْوَةَ ٱلدَّاعِ إِذَا دَعَانِ فَلْيَسْتَجِيبُواْ لِي وَلْيُؤْمِنُواْ بِي لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْشُدُونَ,And when My servants question you concerning Me I am near; I answer the call of the caller when he calls to Me; so let them respond to Me and let them believe in Me that they might go aright. The question of each one indicates his state. They did not ask about any decree created thing this world or what comes next but rather they asked [Muḥammad] about Him so God most high said “And when My servants question you concerning Me...” [These questioners] were not among the group about whom He said “They will question you concerning the mountains” [20:105] nor among the group about whom He said “They will ask you about orphans” [2:220] nor among the group about whom He said “They will ask you about the monthly period” [2:222] nor among the group about whom He said “And they will question you concerning the spirit” [17:85] nor among the group about whom He said “They ask you about wine and divinatory arrows” [2:219] or “They ask you about the sacred month and fighting in it” [2:217]. These were a select group of people. “And when My servants question you concerning Me how could you answer themḍ This answer is not by your tongue O Muḥammad. Even though you are the ambassador between Us and created beings I assume responsibility for this answer: I am near.” In regard to nearness He took away the act of mediating from anyone other than Himself. He did not say “Say to them I am near” but rather He said may His affair be exalted “I am near.” Then He explained what this nearness is. Inasmuch as the Real سبحانه is too holy for drawing near or moving away in terms of direction or speci- fication in any spot buqʿa He said I answer the call of the caller. Verily the Real سبحانه is near wholly and entirely by means of knowledge power hearing and vision. He is near the believers with respect to caretaking help and answering supplications but He is too exalted and holy to be near anyone in essence dhāt or spot buqʿa for He is uniquely without direc- tion in any region aqṬār mighty without being described by substance or measure miqdār. I answer the call of the caller when he calls to Me; so let them respond to Me and let them believe in Me that they might go aright: He did not promise to answer the one who might be considered worthy because of asceticism or [to answer] at the time of worship.
أُحِلَّ لَكُمْ لَيْلَةَ ٱلصِّيَامِ ٱلرَّفَثُ إِلَىٰ نِسَآئِكُمْ هُنَّ لِبَاسٌ لَّكُمْ وَأَنْتُمْ لِبَاسٌ لَّهُنَّ عَلِمَ ٱللَّهُ أَنَّكُمْ كُنتُمْ تَخْتانُونَ أَنْفُسَكُمْ فَتَابَ عَلَيْكُمْ وَعَفَا عَنْكُمْ فَٱلآنَ بَٰشِرُوهُنَّ وَٱبْتَغُواْ مَا كَتَبَ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمْ وَكُلُواْ وَٱشْرَبُواْ حَتَّىٰ يَتَبَيَّنَ لَكُمُ ٱلْخَيْطُ ٱلأَبْيَضُ مِنَ ٱلْخَيْطِ ٱلأَسْوَدِ مِنَ ٱلْفَجْرِ ثُمَّ أَتِمُّواْ ٱلصِّيَامَ إِلَى ٱلَّليْلِ وَلاَ تُبَٰشِرُوهُنَّ وَأَنْتُمْ عَٰكِفُونَ فِي ٱلْمَسَٰجِدِ تِلْكَ حُدُودُ ٱللَّهِ فَلاَ تَقْرَبُوهَا كَذٰلِكَ يُبَيِّنُ ٱللَّهُ ءَايَٰتِهِ لِلنَّاسِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَّقُونَ,Permitted to you upon the night of the fast is to go in to your wives; they are a vestment for you and you are a vestment for them; God knows that you have been betraying yourselves and so He has turned to you [relent- ing] and He has pardoned you. So now lie with them and seek what God has prescribed for you and eat and drink until the white thread is distinct to you from the black thread at daybreak; then complete the fast to the night; [God] informs us that in truth the customs that characterize human beings are not attributable to Him. Whether you are engaged in worship ʿibāda which is the right of the Real or in the customs of companionship with your mate which is the goal sought by your lower self and worldly con- cern-both are the same for your state so long as there is refined behavior adab. The verse was revealed regarding the lapse of al-Fārūq. [God] made that [lapse] an occasion for a dispensation for all Muslims until the resur- rection. Thus are the rulings of the [divine] solicitude. It is said that [God] knew there is no escaping worldly concerns for the servant so He divided the night and day in this month between His right ḥaqq and your worldly portion ḥaẓẓ. He said “As for My right complete the fast to the night and as for your worldly portion eat and drink until the white thread is distinct to you from the black thread at daybreak.” and do not lie with them while you cleave to the mosques in devotion [to God]. Those are God's bounds; do not approach them. So God makes clear His signs to people so that they might fear. [God] states that the place of nearness is sanctified from the seeking of worldly concerns. He said “When you are occupied with your [lower] selves you are veiled through yourselves in yourselves but when your business is with Us do not turn back from Us to yourselves.” It is said that the jealousy ghayra of the Real سبحانه [comes] at the times when serious business is mixed with fun. ʿāÌisha [عليه السلام] said concern- ing it “O Messenger of God I truly love you and love being near to you.” [Muḥammad] replied “Let me be daughter of Abū Bakr I am worshiping my Lord.” He ﷺ said to her “I have a time wherein none but my Lord is allowed me.”
وَلاَ تَأْكُلُوۤاْ أَمْوَالَكُمْ بَيْنَكُمْ بِٱلْبَاطِلِ وَتُدْلُواْ بِهَا إِلَى ٱلْحُكَّامِ لِتَأْكُلُواْ فَرِيقاً مِّنْ أَمْوَالِ ٱلنَّاسِ بِٱلإِثْمِ وَأَنْتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ,Consume not your goods between you in deception and proffer them to the judges that you may consume a portion of other people's goods in sin while you are aware. When you turn to created beings to judge matters know that God is watch- ing over you and His knowledge encompasses you. So situate yourself with shyness before the Real سبحانه. Created beings know externals ẓawāhir but the Real سبحانه وتعالى is the One who governs the innermost secrets of hearts sarāÌir.
يَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ ٱلأَهِلَّةِ قُلْ هِيَ مَوَاقِيتُ لِلنَّاسِ وَٱلْحَجِّ وَلَيْسَ ٱلْبِرُّ بِأَن تَأْتُواْ ٱلْبُيُوتَ مِن ظُهُورِهَا وَلَـٰكِنَّ ٱلْبِرَّ مَنِ ٱتَّقَىٰ وَأْتُواْ ٱلْبُيُوتَ مِنْ أَبْوَابِهَا وَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ,They will ask you about the new moons. Say “They are appointed times for the people and the pilgrimage.” The “moons” ahilla-the plural of a “moon” hilāl-are appointed times for the people for their activities and calculations. For the people of the story ahl al-qiṣṣa they are appointed times for their various states aḥwāl. For the ascetics [they are] appointed times for their litanies awrād. For the elect they are appointed times for their moments ḥālāt. The one who spoke for them said: I count the nights one after another. In the days of old I never really counted them. Another said: Eight days have passed without meeting. I do not have the patience to wait more than eight. Another said: Months pass we have not noticed their midpoints nor their ends. It is not piety to come to the houses from their backs ẓuhūr but piety is to fear; so come to the houses by their doors and fear God that you may prosper. It means that piety is not guarding external affairs al-umūr al-ẓāhira but rather piety is purifying the inner secrets taṣfiyat al-sarāÌir and cleaning the recesses of hearts tanqiyat al-ḌamāÌir.
وَقَاتِلُواْ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلَّذِينَ يُقَاتِلُونَكُمْ وَلاَ تَعْتَدُوۤاْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لاَ يُحِبُّ ٱلْمُعْتَدِينَ,And fight in the way of God with those who fight against you but do not transgress limits; God loves not the transgressors. Let your lower selves be trusts for the Real: when He commands their restraint restrain and protect them. When He commands [you] to commit them to fighting do not hold them back from His command. This is the meaning of His words but do not transgress limits-that you stop wherever you are made to stop and do what you have been commanded.
وَٱقْتُلُوهُمْ حَيْثُ ثَقِفْتُمُوهُم وَأَخْرِجُوهُمْ مِّنْ حَيْثُ أَخْرَجُوكُمْ وَٱلْفِتْنَةُ أَشَدُّ مِنَ ٱلْقَتْلِ وَلاَ تُقَاتِلُوهُمْ عِنْدَ ٱلْمَسْجِدِ ٱلْحَرَامِ حَتَّىٰ يُقَاتِلُوكُمْ فِيهِ فَإِن قَاتَلُوكُمْ فَٱقْتُلُوهُمْ كَذَلِكَ جَزَآءُ ٱلْكَافِرِينَ,And slay them wherever you come upon them It means “It is incumbent on you to show enmity toward My enemies just as it is incumbent on you to establish friendship walāya and assistance muwālā with My friends awliyāÌ. So do not spare them even if there are bonds of kinship or close relation between you.” and expel them from where they expelled you; “First expel [your] love and mutual assistance with them from your hearts and then drive them from the regions of Islam so that they will be diminished.” sedition is more grievous than slaying. Here the allusion is to the ordeal that comes to hearts qulūb from the misfortunes of veiling; this is more grievous than that which comes to the bodily selves nufūs from the exertion of the spirit rūḥ because the pass- ing away of the life of the heart is more grievous than the passing away of the life of the bodily self. The bodily selves live through what is fitting and familiar to them but the heart can only live through God. It is said that sedition is more grievous than slaying means that remain- ing apart from God is much worse than letting go of your spirit ruḥ and your life ḥayāt. But fight them not by the sacred mosque until they should fight you there; then if they fight you slay them-such is the requital of disbelievers. The allusion in it: Do not disturb your time waqt with God [do not] let in the attributes that characterize the bodily and lower self even if these involve supererogatory acts of obedience. If a noisy preoccupation distracts you from God remove that matter from yourself by every means possible so that no attachment remains to block you from God.
فَإِنِ ٱنتَهَوْاْ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,But if they desist surely God is Forgiving Merciful. The allusion in it: When the clamor of your thoughts and the enemies of your self nafs cut you off and they separate you from [God] and jostle you give up the chatter of the lower self nafs and stop its combative motion for surely those who have been asked to guard the innermost selves asrār should not have any business with the exertions of the lower selves nufūs in their various oppositional ways.
وَقَاتِلُوهُمْ حَتَّىٰ لاَ تَكُونَ فِتْنَةٌ وَيَكُونَ ٱلدِّينُ للَّهِ فَإِنِ ٱنْتَهَواْ فَلاَ عُدْوَانَ إِلاَّ عَلَى ٱلظَّالِمِينَ,Fight them till there is no sedition and the religion is for God; then if they desist there shall be no enmity save against evildoers. The allusion in the verse is to combat against the lower selves nufūs for your worst enemy is your lower self nafs within you. That is to say “Hold completely to the precepts of spiritual disciplines riyāḌāt until nothing remains of carnal human traces āthār bashariyya. Submit the self nafs and heart qalb to God so there will be no opponent or combatant from within you [fighting] to protect [yourself] taking instruction [from the lower self] managing [your own affairs] or exercising free choice in any state. The vicissitudes [of life] will flow over you as He wills them and you will be effaced from making any choices aside from what comes with the decree.” When the self nafs surrenders there is no enmity except toward the masters of holding back arbāb al-taqṣīr but those who uphold the right of [God's] command are far removed from any obligation to compel [others to do so].
ٱلشَّهْرُ ٱلْحَرَامُ بِٱلشَّهْرِ ٱلْحَرَامِ وَٱلْحُرُمَاتُ قِصَاصٌ فَمَنِ ٱعْتَدَىٰ عَلَيْكُمْ فَٱعْتَدُواْ عَلَيْهِ بِمِثْلِ مَا ٱعْتَدَىٰ عَلَيْكُمْ وَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَٱعْلَمُواْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ مَعَ ٱلْمُتَّقِينَ,The sacred month for the sacred month; holy things demand retalia- tion; whoever commits aggression against you then commit aggression against him in the manner that he committed against you; and fear God and know that God is with the God-fearing. [Here] the allusion is to: “When two of the rights of God face off submit the moment waqt to the decree of the moment ḥukm al-waqt and turn with the allusions of the moment ishārāt al-waqt. Beware of preferring one over the other in what you possess in your worldly portion ḥaẓẓ- even a little-for you will be veiled from witnessing the Real ḥaqq and the vision of your heart will be blinded. Everything that is closer to what opposes your whims and further from what attracts and pleases you is in itself more appropriate.” And know that God is with the God-fearing those who fear the prefer- ence of their own whims over that with which He is pleased. When they act for God in what they do rather than for themselves God most high is with them through [His] help: He said “If you help God He will help you” [47:7].
وَأَنْفِقُواْ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ وَلاَ تُلْقُواْ بِأَيْدِيكُمْ إِلَى ٱلتَّهْلُكَةِ وَأَحْسِنُوۤاْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُحِبُّ ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,And spend in the way of God; and cast not your own hands into destruction; but be virtuous; God loves the virtuous. The rich spend from their wealth. The worshipers spend through their lower selves by not holding back acts of worship and [religious] tasks. Those who have deep knowledge spend with their hearts by not holding back from His decrees. The lovers spend with their spirits by not holding back from His love. The rich spend from [material] blessings niʿam and the poor fuqarāÌ spend from aspirations himam. The rich spend by taking money from the purse. The poor fuqarāÌ spend by taking [concern for] the rich from the heart. Those who declare God's unity spend by removing [concern for] created things from their innermost selves. His words “and cast not your own hands into destruction” allude to holding back your hands from exertion for the one who holds back his hands and hoards anything for himself his hands throw him into destruction. It is said that it is to prefer your whims over [God's] good pleasure. It is also said and cast not your own hands into destruction means being heedless of Him by [your own] free choice. It is also said [it is] imagining that you can live without His kindness and His favor for even a moment. It is also said [it is] contentment in your state of lassitude and being veiled. It is also said [it is] holding the tongue back from perpetually seeking help in every breath. His words “But be virtuous God loves the virtuous muḥsinūn”: Virtuousness iḥsān is being kind with everyone but yourself. When you are virtuous with regard to your lower self it looks-to those with poor judgment-like you are harming it. But it is through [your lower self] that you bring about every misery and endure every calamity. Virtuousness is also leaving every last bit of your worldly concerns and devoting your- self to fulfilling the right of anyone whose affair is connected to you. Virtuousness is to worship Him without becoming inattentive and to wor- ship Him through the quality of witnessing.
وَأَتِمُّواْ ٱلْحَجَّ وَٱلْعُمْرَةَ للَّهِ فَإِنْ أُحْصِرْتُمْ فَمَا ٱسْتَيْسَرَ مِنَ ٱلْهَدْيِ وَلاَ تَحْلِقُواْ رُؤُوسَكُمْ حَتَّىٰ يَبْلُغَ ٱلْهَدْيُ مَحِلَّهُ فَمَن كَانَ مِنكُم مَّرِيضاً أَوْ بِهِ أَذًى مِّن رَّأْسِهِ فَفِدْيَةٌ مِّن صِيَامٍ أَوْ صَدَقَةٍ أَوْ نُسُكٍ فَإِذَآ أَمِنتُمْ فَمَن تَمَتَّعَ بِٱلْعُمْرَةِ إِلَى ٱلْحَجِّ فَمَا ٱسْتَيْسَرَ مِنَ ٱلْهَدْيِ فَمَن لَّمْ يَجِدْ فَصِيَامُ ثَلاثَةِ أَيَّامٍ فِي ٱلْحَجِّ وَسَبْعَةٍ إِذَا رَجَعْتُمْ تِلْكَ عَشَرَةٌ كَامِلَةٌ ذٰلِكَ لِمَن لَّمْ يَكُنْ أَهْلُهُ حَاضِرِي ٱلْمَسْجِدِ ٱلْحَرَامِ وَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَٱعْلَمُواْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ شَدِيدُ ٱلْعِقَابِ,Fulfill the pilgrimage and the visitation to God; The fulfillment of the pilgrimage according to the language of scholars is the performance of its basic elements its practice its form and the shedding of blood which is required in it without curtailing any of the conditions. It is mentioned in the tafsīr literature that in both [the ḥajj and the ʿumra] you are forbidden from the dwellings of your family [until you have completed all the requirements]. In the language of allusion the pilgrimage is the quest qaṣd. The quest is to the House of the Real and the quest to the Real is first the pilgrim- age of ordinary people and second the pilgrimage of the elect. Just as the one who makes the pilgrimage through his [outward] self enters the consecrated state and stands [at ʿArafāt] circumambulates the House and runs [between ṣafā and Marwa] and then shaves [his head] so it is with the one who makes the pilgrimage through his heart. His state of consecration iḥrām [comes] from [his] sound resolve ʿaqd ṣaḥīḥ to undertake a pure quest qaṣd ṣarīḥ. He removes the clothing of his oppositional ten- dencies and his carnal passions. He then wraps himself in the two robes of patience and poverty. He abstains from pursuing his worldly fortunes [that is] the following of whims and he releases thoughts of desired things etc. Then [just as] as the [outward] pilgrim becomes increasingly unkempt and dusty likewise the traces of humility and submission appear upon [the pilgrim of the heart]. Then the talbiya of the innermost selves occurs in the response of every part of you. “The most excellent of the actions of the pilgrimage ḥajj are the sac- rificial blood-letting thajj and the crying out ʿajj.” The thajj is the pouring of blood [of the animal sacrificed] and the ʿajj is raising the voice in talbiya. Likewise the shedding of the blood of the lower self [comes] with the knives of opposition [to it] and the raising of the voices of the innermost self [comes] by continuously seeking [God's] help and with the beauty of responding [to the call]. Then [one] stands at the plains of nearness seeking perfection in the attributes of awe. The standing place of the [outward] selves is ʿArafāt while the standing place of hearts is the names and attributes ṣifāt belonging to the majesty of the essence dhāt at the time of intimate communications muwāṣalāt.
ٱلْحَجُّ أَشْهُرٌ مَّعْلُومَاتٌ فَمَن فَرَضَ فِيهِنَّ ٱلْحَجَّ فَلاَ رَفَثَ وَلاَ فُسُوقَ وَلاَ جِدَالَ فِي ٱلْحَجِّ وَمَا تَفْعَلُواْ مِنْ خَيْرٍ يَعْلَمْهُ ٱللَّهُ وَتَزَوَّدُواْ فَإِنَّ خَيْرَ ٱلزَّادِ ٱلتَّقْوَىٰ وَٱتَّقُونِ يٰأُوْلِي ٱلأَلْبَابِ,The pilgrimage is in months well-known; The pilgrimage for the bodily selves nufūs is in months well-known. The iḥrām is only binding in it and it is not possible to undertake the pilgrimage during the rest of the year rather [it is] only in a specific time period. One for whom that time has passed the pilgrimage has passed him. Likewise the pilgrimage of the hearts has times [that are] well-known and [it] is only appropriate during them. These are the days of youth for one who has no spiritual desire irāda in his youth has no communion in the state of his old age. Likewise the one for whom the time of his quest qaṣd and spiritual desire irāda has passed only the worship whose outcome is the garden is appropriate not the spiritual desire irāda whose outcome is communion. whoever undertakes the duty of pilgrimage during them then no lewdness nor wickedness or disputing in the pilgrimage. The allusion is also to whoever travels the path of spiritual desire that he should not stop at anything in the path nor mix his spiritual desire with anything. Whoever argues opposes or is rude with him-he yields to them all. He does not dispute with anyone for the sake of this world nor does he compete with anyone for some worldly fortune for the self or honor. God most high said “And when the ignorant address them they say 'peace'” [25:63]. Whatever good you do God knows it. You should be content with His knowledge and His judgment rather than being seen judged or known by His creatures. And take provision. But the best provision is piety; and fear Me O people of pith! The piety of ordinary people is the avoidance of errors while the piety of the elect is the avoidance of anything other [than God] in the inner secrets of their hearts.
لَيْسَ عَلَيْكُمْ جُنَاحٌ أَن تَبْتَغُواْ فَضْلاً مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ فَإِذَآ أَفَضْتُم مِّنْ عَرَفَٰتٍ فَٱذْكُرُواْ ٱللَّهَ عِندَ ٱلْمَشْعَرِ ٱلْحَرَامِ وَٱذْكُرُوهُ كَمَا هَدَٰكُمْ وَإِن كُنْتُمْ مِّن قَبْلِهِ لَمِنَ ٱلضَّآلِّينَ,You would not be at fault if you should seek bounty from your Lord; [Here] the allusion is that whatever you seek from the bounty of God-from what has been determined for you according to His rightful decree-is praiseworthy if it has a portion for the Muslims or the strength of the religion dīn. Whatever you seek solely for your worldly fortune or for what benefits you is flawed. but when you press on from ʿArafāt then remember God at the sacred waymark; and remember Him as He has guided you though previously you were astray. [Here] the allusion is to when you have gone so far as to perform what He has requested [you should] remember His favor with you for if He had not desired you you would not have desired Him. If He had not chosen you you would not have preferred His good pleasure.
ثُمَّ أَفِيضُواْ مِنْ حَيْثُ أَفَاضَ ٱلنَّاسُ وَٱسْتَغْفِرُواْ ٱللَّهَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,Then press on from where the people press on and seek God's forgive- ness; God is Forgiving Merciful. The allusion [in this part of the verse] is that you should not see yourself as different from others because of some manner of dressing patched clothing or some quality that distinguishes you outwardly. Rather you should [consider yourself only as] one among [all] humanity. When the thought comes to you that you have done something or that anything [happens] through you for you or with you seek God's forgiveness and renew your faith for [this kind of thought] is a hidden idolatry shirk that infects your heart.
فَإِذَا قَضَيْتُمْ مَّنَاسِكَكُمْ فَٱذْكُرُواْ ٱللَّهَ كَذِكْرِكُمْ آبَآءَكُمْ أَوْ أَشَدَّ ذِكْراً فَمِنَ ٱلنَّاسِ مَن يَقُولُ رَبَّنَآ آتِنَا فِي ٱلدُّنْيَا وَمَا لَهُ فِي ٱلآخِرَةِ مِنْ خَلاَقٍ,And when you have performed your holy rites remember God as you remember your fathers or yet more intensely. And when you have performed your holy rites is an allusion to carrying out the rightful due ḥaqq of servanthood ʿubūdiyya. Remember God as you remember your fathers is an allusion to carrying out the rightful due ḥaqq of love maḥabba. The performance of the holy rites is an undertaking through the self nafs. Remember God as you remember your fathers is an undertaking for His sake through the heart qalb continuously in the moment and throughout one's life. It is said that “Just as others boast of their fathers and delight in their ancestors let your boasting and delight be in Us.” It is said that “If your fathers have a right to raise and educate you Our right over you is even more binding since Our favors to you are more perfect.” It is said “Your ancestors may have glorious deeds and virtues but Our worthiness from the attributes of sublimity jalāl is far beyond anything due to your ancestors from the best of their states.” It is said that “If you never grow weary of remembering your father and you rarely forget him then remember Us continually and do not let weariness boredom or forgetfulness stop you.” It is said that “If someone speaks ill of your lineage you are not pleased. Similarly do not listen to the words of those who err and contrive but rather defend Us.” It is said that “The father is remembered with respect and deference. Similarly remember Us with awe even as you [also] remember the kind- ness of nearness and the best of caring.” He said “Remember God as you remember your fathers” but did not say “your mothers” because the father is remembered out of respect and the mother is remembered out of com- passion for her. God shows mercy-He is not the recipient of it. Or yet more intensely because the Real ḥaqq is more deserving aḥaqq. You might be much estranged from your father while the Real سبحانه is free from any thought coming to those who have knowledge of Him that they would oppose what has been made obligatory in even the smallest way. As you remember your fathers the father according to his rightful due and the Lord according to His rightful due.
وِمِنْهُمْ مَّن يَقُولُ رَبَّنَآ آتِنَا فِي ٱلدُّنْيَا حَسَنَةً وَفِي ٱلآخِرَةِ حَسَنَةً وَقِنَا عَذَابَ ٱلنَّارِ,And there are others who say “Our Lord give to us in this world good and good in the hereafter and guard us against the chastisement of the Fire.” He means in [this verse] good ḥasana the existence of which is consistent with all good things. The good by which all good things are obtained in this world is the protection of their faith at the end [of their lives] for whoever leaves this world as a believer will not abide in the fire and the passing of this [world] will be of little consequence. The good which is consistent with the good things of the hereafter is forgiveness for when He forgives nothing but good follows. It is said that the good in this world is turning away from it and the good in the hereafter is being protected from becoming comfortable in it. The guarding is from the fire nār and the fires of separation furqa; because the [letter] lām in His saying al-nār is a generic lām so the seeking of refuge applies to both the fires of burning nīrān al-ḥurqa and the fires of separation nīrān al-furqa. It is said that the good in this world is witnessing shuhūd through the innermost selves bi-l-asrār and in the hereafter [it is] seeing ruÌya through the physical eyes bi-l-abṣār. It is said that the good of this world is that He annihilates you from yourself337 while the good of the hereafter is that He returns you to yourself. It is said that the good of this world is the success granted [by God] in service tawfīq al-khidma and the good of the hereafter is the actualization of communion taḥqīq al-wuṣla.
أُولَـٰئِكَ لَهُمْ نَصِيبٌ مِّمَّا كَسَبُواْ وَٱللَّهُ سَرِيعُ ٱلْحِسَابِ,Those-they shall have a portion from what they have earned; If [what they have earned] was good then a good [portion]. If it was something else then something else. and God is swift at reckoning [The reckoning occurs] for ordinary people at [the Day of Judgment] and for the elect at every breath. It is said that He mentioned two groups: those who say “Our Lord give to us in this world” and those who say “Give to us in this world and the next.” The third group which is not mentioned are those who are content with His decree those who submit to His command those who forgo every supplication and request.
وَٱذْكُرُواْ ٱللَّهَ فِيۤ أَيَّامٍ مَّعْدُودَاتٍ فَمَن تَعَجَّلَ فِي يَوْمَيْنِ فَلاَ إِثْمَ عَلَيْهِ وَمَن تَأَخَّرَ فَلاۤ إِثْمَ عَلَيْهِ لِمَنِ ٱتَّقَىٰ وَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَٱعْلَمُوآ أَنَّكُمْ إِلَيْهِ تُحْشَرُونَ,And remember God during certain days numbered. If any man has- tens on in two days that is no sin for him; and if he delays it is not a sin for him; if he fears; and fear God and know that to Him you shall be gathered. This is a description of the last part of the [pilgrimage] ceremonies the throwing [of stones] in the days at Minā. Because of what they have offered in the pillars of the pilgrimage He lightens their load by letting them choose the duration of the stay adding [more time] or hastening to leave. [Here] the allusion is to one whose lower self has been extinguished while his heart lives on in the perpetual realities of witnessing. In his per- petual engagement in the manners of being present ādāb al-ḥuḌūr if something from the branches of devotions falls away there is a replacement for what has passed away.
وَمِنَ ٱلنَّاسِ مَن يُعْجِبُكَ قَوْلُهُ فِي ٱلْحَيَٰوةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَيُشْهِدُ ٱللَّهَ عَلَىٰ مَا فِي قَلْبِهِ وَهُوَ أَلَدُّ ٱلْخِصَامِ,And among people there is he whose speech in the life of this world pleases you; and who calls on God to witness what is in his heart; yet he is most stubborn in dispute. He relates that the Real سبحانه وتعالى has given some people skill in speaking outwardly yet [He] has turned away from their hearts which are bound by the ropes of deprivation and covered by their own ignorance. There is no meaning beyond [their outward selves] and nothing of weight in what they say. One cannot rely on their faithfulness nor trust in them in any way. The allusion is to the people of external appearances ahl al-ẓāhir who have not been helped by the lights of insight and are bound to the precepts of the external world. They have no faith in this kind of talk and no insight into this [path] as a whole. It is necessary to keep secrets from them since they will only receive this discourse with disapproval. Peaceable people among ordinary folk who have respect for this path and faith in the whole of this discourse are far closer to this way than those who count themselves among the elect but are cut off from faith in this affair.
وَإِذَا تَوَلَّىٰ سَعَىٰ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ لِيُفْسِدَ فِيِهَا وَيُهْلِكَ ٱلْحَرْثَ وَٱلنَّسْلَ وَٱللَّهُ لاَ يُحِبُّ ٱلفَسَادَ,And when he turns his back he hastens about the earth to do cor- ruption there and to destroy the tillage and the stock; and God loves not corruption. [Here] the allusion is to those who only hasten to seek worldly fortunes. They are not concerned even though the ties to their religion have become unraveled and their bonds to Islam have been weakened. After that the ropes [tying them to] the world become stronger and the bonds of their desires become more closely woven with the prohibited things they have gathered and the debris they have acquired. When they retire to their whis- perings and ruinous aims they hasten to corruption make decisions based on worldly [aims] and employ people to help them in furthering their affairs-people from whose hearts God has removed inner sight. And God loves not corruption: Outward corruption is whatever brings about the ruin of religious affairs and the proper ordering of worldly matters.
وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُ ٱتَّقِ ٱللَّهَ أَخَذَتْهُ ٱلْعِزَّةُ بِٱلإِثْمِ فَحَسْبُهُ جَهَنَّمُ وَلَبِئْسَ ٱلْمِهَادُ,And when it is said to him “Fear God” he is seized by vainglory in his sin. So Hell shall be enough for him-how evil a cradling! Those are the people who have been seized by arrogance and who have lost the ability to humbly accept fair criticism; they turn up their noses at accepting the truth. When you enjoin someone [like this] to decency he says “How can you say this to someone like me when I am such and suchḍ” Then he turns it around and attacks you saying “You have more need to be enjoined with decency and forbidden indecency because your condi- tion is such and such...” If God had granted success to help him or mercy had reached him he would have been granted the favor shown to those who have been guided to seeing their errors and observing their bad traits. And he would not have harbored enmity toward the one who gave him the advice the traces of which remain in the heart for years. God most high said “So hell shall be enough for him” meaning [hell is] the state of his estrangement the darknesses of the lower self and the constriction of choice such that he does not hasten in anything except his [lower] desire. At every moment over and over he succumbs to [this] chastisement and trial. Then he is transported from this chastisement to the greater chastisement. God most high said “And We shall surely make them taste the nearer chastisement before the greater chastisement” [32:21].
وَمِنَ ٱلنَّاسِ مَن يَشْرِي نَفْسَهُ ٱبْتِغَآءَ مَرْضَاتِ ٱللَّهِ وَٱللَّهُ رَؤُوفٌ بِٱلْعِبَادِ,But there are other men who sell themselves desiring God's pleasure; and God is gentle with His servants. Those who have been touched by the special favors of mercy and raised up by the fate already preordained [for them] prefer the good pleasure of the Real over themselves and submit entirely to their protector mawlā. God is gentle with His servants and because of His gentleness they attain these states-they do not deserve His gentleness because of these states.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ ٱدْخُلُواْ فِي ٱلسِّلْمِ كَآفَّةً وَلاَ تَتَّبِعُواْ خُطُوَاتِ ٱلشَّيْطَانِ إِنَّهُ لَكُمْ عَدُوٌّ مُّبِينٌ,O you who believe come all of you into submission; and follow not the steps of Satan; he is a manifest foe to you. [God] has charged the believer with making peace with everyone except his lower self for it makes no move except to oppose [the believer's] leader sayyid. Anyone who makes peace with himself becomes listless in his spiritual exertions mujāhadāt. This is the reason a seeker falls short and an aspirant loses interest. The steps of Satan are what are whispered to you about your inability to hold to the precepts of moral behavior and [your inability] to abandon unwise inclinations that are best ignored. But it is as God most high said “If you fear for him cast him into the waters” [28:7]. Look what He did with [Moses] when [Moses's mother] cast him [into the water] and how He returned him to her after saving him!
فَإِن زَلَلْتُمْ مِّن بَعْدِ مَا جَآءَتْكُمُ ٱلْبَيِّنَاتُ فَٱعْلَمُوۤاْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ,But if you slip after the clear proofs have come to you know then that God is Mighty Wise. A single slip after the disclosure of clear proofs is uglier by far than the many slips committed before this disclosure. Those who are known to be treacherous cannot be trusted. When the tribulation for the worst sins descends they will be completely uprooted.
هَلْ يَنظُرُونَ إِلاَّ أَن يَأْتِيَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ فِي ظُلَلٍ مِّنَ ٱلْغَمَامِ وَٱلْمَلاۤئِكَةُ وَقُضِيَ ٱلأَمْرُ وَإِلَى ٱللَّهِ تُرْجَعُ ٱلأُمُورُ,What do they wait for that God shall come to them in the shadows of clouds and the angelsḍ The matter is determined and to God all matters are returned. The people thought that the Hour would be long in coming but the details tell them of the severity of the matter. [What are described] are acts af ʿāl [of God] only in the sense of the terrible events ahwāl [of that Hour]. God سبحانه divulges them so as to remove their doubt concerning the gran- deur of His affair and the implementation of His power in what He wills. The matter is determined and to God all matters are returned that is the veil of the unseen is removed exposing the clarity of the [divine] preordination. The hearts of those who declare His oneness are lit by the lights of insights and [therefore] they have no need to seek interpretation taÌwīl of this verse and those like it since [they know] the Real سبحانه is far removed from any change in locality or fading or specificity in place or time. He is sanctified from every movement and appearing [before human beings].
سَلْ بَنِيۤ إِسْرَائِيلَ كَمْ آتَيْنَاهُم مِّنْ آيَةٍ بَيِّنَةٍ وَمَن يُبَدِّلْ نِعْمَةَ ٱللَّهِ مِن بَعْدِ مَا جَآءَتْهُ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ شَدِيدُ ٱلْعِقَابِ,Ask the children of Israel how many a clear proof did We give them; whoever changes God's grace after it has come to him God is severe in retribution. The benefit of questioning [the children of Israel] was to make them acknowledge the issue of proof. Questioning them was not for the pur- poses of resolving any doubt on the part of the Messenger ﷺ concerning what had been plainly established by proof. Whoever changes God's grace after it has come to him God is severe in retribution in taking this grace away. At that moment they will recognize its worth and then they will mourn it since they will never attain it. The one who spoke for them said: You will leave and abandon me.Then you will look for me but you will not find me.
زُيِّنَ لِلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ ٱلْحَيَاةُ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَيَسْخَرُونَ مِنَ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَٱلَّذِينَ ٱتَّقَواْ فَوْقَهُمْ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ وَٱللَّهُ يَرْزُقُ مَن يَشَآءُ بِغَيْرِ حِسَابٍ,Decked out fair to the disbelievers is the life of this world; and they deride the believers; but those who fear shall be above them on the Day of Resurrection; and God sustains whomever He will without reckoning. They were deceived without realizing it. The increasing darkness of their vision caused them to slander and to deride the friends [of God] سبحانه. When people bear witness [on the Day of Resurrection] and when the error of ignorance is dispelled from their hearts they will know those who are in a state of loss and those who have gone far astray.
كَانَ ٱلنَّاسُ أُمَّةً وَٰحِدَةً فَبَعَثَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلنَّبِيِّينَ مُبَشِّرِينَ وَمُنذِرِينَ وَأَنزَلَ مَعَهُمُ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ بِٱلْحَقِّ لِيَحْكُمَ بَيْنَ ٱلنَّاسِ فِيمَا ٱخْتَلَفُواْ فِيهِ وَمَا ٱخْتَلَفَ فِيهِ إِلاَّ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُوهُ مِن بَعْدِ مَا جَآءَتْهُمُ ٱلْبَيِّنَٰتُ بَغْياً بَيْنَهُمْ فَهَدَى ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ لِمَا ٱخْتَلَفُواْ فِيهِ مِنَ ٱلْحَقِّ بِإِذْنِهِ وَٱللَّهُ يَهْدِي مَن يَشَآءُ إِلَىٰ صِرَٰطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ,People were one community; then God sent forth the prophets as bear- ers of good tidings and warners; and He revealed with them the scripture with the truth that He might decide between people regarding their differences; and only those who had been given it differed about it after the clear proofs had come to them out of insolence one to another; then God guided those who believed to the truth regarding which they were at variance by His leave; and God guides whomever He will to a straight path. It means that they were united by what they did not know of the truth. Then when He sent the messengers they were distinguished by what they were given or deprived of from the lights of insight. It is said that they were as they had been previously in the pre-eternal choosing and [they only] became the Jewish people and the Christian people with the coming of the messengers. In the end each one will be returned to what was preordained for him. Verily all mankind was gathered together in His سبحانه knowl- edge and then separated by His decree ḥukm. Some people He guided hadāhum and some He led astray aghwāhum. Some people He veiled ḥajabahum and some He attracted jadhabahum. Some people He bound to disappointment khidhlān and some He opened to beneficence iḥsān. It is not a matter of acquisition for those who are accepted nor is there a cause for the rejection of those rejected. Rather it is a decree ḥukm that has been completed and a [divine] determination qaḌāÌ that has been settled.
أَمْ حَسِبْتُمْ أَن تَدْخُلُواْ ٱلْجَنَّةَ وَلَمَّا يَأْتِكُم مَّثَلُ ٱلَّذِينَ خَلَوْاْ مِن قَبْلِكُم مَّسَّتْهُمُ ٱلْبَأْسَآءُ وَٱلضَّرَّآءُ وَزُلْزِلُواْ حَتَّىٰ يَقُولَ ٱلرَّسُولُ وَٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ مَعَهُ مَتَىٰ نَصْرُ ٱللَّهِ أَلاۤ إِنَّ نَصْرَ ٱللَّهِ قَرِيبٌ,Or did you suppose that you should enter paradise without there hav- ing come upon you the like of those who passed away before youḍ They were afflicted by misery and hardship and were so convulsed that the Messenger and those who believed with him said “When will God's help comeḍ” Ah but surely God's help is nigh. God created paradise and surrounded it with difficulties maṣāʿib. He cre- ated the fire and surrounded it with carnal desires and cravings raghāÌib. Anyone who is too shy to ride the terrors ahwāl will be kept from real- izing [his] hopes āmāl. Verily the Real سبحانه tested the ancients through their endurance of all kinds of hardships. He causes anyone who follows [in the footsteps] of the friends to be included in their path and share in their adversities. Anyone who thinks otherwise thinks a mirage is water. A dream does not transpire the way one thinks it should. The way sunna of God سبحانه has come to pass with the friends such that they only came to rest in the courtyard of victory after commanding the open spaces of des- peration. Although their anticipation is prolonged kindness will come to them all of a sudden and what they strove for will be realized unexpectedly.God most high said “Ah but surely God's help is nigh.”
يَسْأَلُونَكَ مَاذَا يُنْفِقُونَ قُلْ مَآ أَنْفَقْتُمْ مِّنْ خَيْرٍ فَلِلْوَالِدَيْنِ وَٱلأَقْرَبِينَ وَٱلْيَتَامَىٰ وَٱلْمَسَاكِينِ وَٱبْنِ ٱلسَّبِيلِ وَمَا تَفْعَلُواْ مِنْ خَيْرٍ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ بِهِ عَلِيمٌ,They will ask you about what they should expend. Say “Whatever you expend of good it is for parents and kinsmen orphans the needy and the traveler; and whatever good you may do God has knowledge of it.” They know that the servant does not act alone in what he does for surely the servant cannot do anything without the leave of his Protector. So expend in the manner elaborated [in this verse] for servanthood means standing wherever the command would have you stand. It is said that they do not expend according to the suggestions of whim. Rather they study the details of the affair and the suggestions of the law. The [word] “and” wa in this verse in His saying “and kinsmen and orphans” indicates a kind of sequence: first [spend on] your parents according to what is honorable then your kinsmen then those who follow in the stated sequence.
كُتِبَ عَلَيْكُمُ ٱلْقِتَالُ وَهُوَ كُرْهٌ لَّكُمْ وَعَسَىٰ أَن تَكْرَهُواْ شَيْئاً وَهُوَ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ وَعَسَىٰ أَن تُحِبُّواْ شَيْئاً وَهُوَ شَرٌّ لَّكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ وَأَنْتُمْ لاَ تَعْلَمُونَ,Prescribed for you is fighting though it be hateful to you. Yet it may happen that you hate a thing which is good for you; and it may happen that you love a thing which is bad for you; God knows and you know not. The engagement with fighting is difficult for the lower selves. [God] explained that the comforts of the lower selves are deferred muÌajjala because they follow the ordinance of discipline taÌdīb. It is the opposite for the comforts of the hearts which are immediate muʿajjala since they follow the property of drawing near taqrīb. Happiness lies in opposing mukhālafa the lower selves for anyone who conforms wāfaqa to them has abandoned the exemplary path al-maḥajjat al-muthlā. Likewise happiness lies in conforming muwāfaqa to the hearts for anyone who opposes khālafa them deviates from the highest way al-sunnat al-ʿulā. It is better to accept the good news of the Real's guarantee of ease than the anxious thoughts of the lower selves that warn of impending difficulty and harm.
يَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ ٱلشَّهْرِ ٱلْحَرَامِ قِتَالٍ فِيهِ قُلْ قِتَالٌ فِيهِ كَبِيرٌ وَصَدٌّ عَن سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ وَكُفْرٌ بِهِ وَٱلْمَسْجِدِ ٱلْحَرَامِ وَإِخْرَاجُ أَهْلِهِ مِنْهُ أَكْبَرُ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ وَٱلْفِتْنَةُ أَكْبَرُ مِنَ ٱلْقَتْلِ وَلاَ يَزَالُونَ يُقَاتِلُونَكُمْ حَتَّىٰ يَرُدُّوكُمْ عَن دِينِكُمْ إِن اسْتَطَاعُواْ وَمَن يَرْتَدِدْ مِنْكُمْ عَن دِينِهِ فَيَمُتْ وَهُوَ كَافِرٌ فَأُوْلـٰئِكَ حَبِطَتْ أَعْمَالُهُمْ فِي ٱلدُّنْيَا وَٱلآخِرَةِ وَأُوْلـٰئِكَ أَصْحَابُ ٱلنَّارِ هُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ,They ask you about the sacred month and fighting in it. Say “Fighting in it is a grave thing; but to bar from God's way and disbelief in Him and the sacred mosque and to expel its people from it-that is graver in God's sight; and sedition is graver than slaying.” Among the acts of disobedience some are worse than others and more intractable. Bad manners at the door do not have the same consequences as they do on the [more intimate] carpet. When the error occurs through the lower self the effect upon [the lower self] is through the deferrred punishment which is burning iḥtirāq [in the hereafter]. When the heart errs the punishment is immediate through separation firāq. The effect of heedlessness on hearts is more serious than the harm caused to the lower selves by error for surely the lower self is kept from good fortune ḥaẓẓ but the heart is kept from the Real ḥaqq. They will not cease to fight against you until they turn you from your religion if they are able; and whoever of you turns from his religion and dies disbelieving-their works have failed in this world and the hereafter. Those are the inhabitants of the fire abiding therein. The allusion in this is to the people of heedlessness when they seek to lure you away and want to turn you toward their heedlessness. They will only be content when you break the pact of your spiritual desire irāda by returning to your previous state. Anyone who breaks fasakha his pledge to God deforms masakha his heart.
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَٱلَّذِينَ هَاجَرُواْ وَجَٰهَدُواْ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ أُوْلـٰئِكَ يَرْجُونَ رَحْمَتَ ٱللَّهِ وَٱللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,Verily the believers and those who emigrate and struggle in God's way-those have hope of God's compassion; and God is Forgiving Merciful. Verily those who are sincere in their seeking and faithful to their pledge will not let [their] spiritual desire flag. These are the ones who live in the gentle wind of hope; they [hope] that they will reach the perfection of subsisting [in God] baqāÌ and the abode of meeting liqāÌ.
يَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ ٱلْخَمْرِ وَٱلْمَيْسِرِ قُلْ فِيهِمَآ إِثْمٌ كَبِيرٌ وَمَنَٰفِعُ لِلنَّاسِ وَإِثْمُهُمَآ أَكْبَرُ مِن نَّفْعِهِمَا وَيَسْأَلُونَكَ مَاذَا يُنفِقُونَ قُلِ ٱلْعَفْوَ كَذٰلِكَ يُبيِّنُ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمُ ٱلأيَٰتِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَفَكَّرُونَ  *  فِي ٱلدُّنْيَا وَٱلآخِرَةِ وَيَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ ٱلْيَتَامَىٰ قُلْ إِصْلاَحٌ لَّهُمْ خَيْرٌ وَإِنْ تُخَالِطُوهُمْ فَإِخْوَانُكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ ٱلْمُفْسِدَ مِنَ ٱلْمُصْلِحِ وَلَوْ شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ لأَعْنَتَكُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ,They ask you about wine khamr and divinatory arrows. Say: “In both is great sin and profit for men; but the sin in them is greater than the usefulness.” Khamr is whatever intoxicates the mind. Just as khamr is specifically prohib- ited so also drunkenness sukr is prohibited by the words of the Prophet ﷺ “Khamr itself is prohibited and drunkenness from any drink.” From the point of view of the allusions [in the verse] anyone who is drunk from the drink of heedlessness deserves the same as the one who drinks khamr. Just as the one who is drunk is prohibited from praying so the one who is possessed by the drunkenness of heedlessness is veiled from intimate com- munications muwāṣalāt and the clearest testimonial evidence of ecstatic finding wujūd. Anyone who does not think this is true should test it. The notion of gambling can be found in most of the transactions of the people of heedlessness when they follow the way of stratagem and decep- tion and lie in what they say. Wholehearted commitment to truthfulness and equitable dealings is rare and precious. And they will ask you what they should expend. Say: “Comfortably” al-ʿafw. So God makes clear His signs to you that you might reflect on this world and the hereafter. It is said that al-ʿafw is what is in excess of your needs. This is for the elect who take from the surplus of their wealth according to their capacities. As for the elect of the elect their way is “preference” īthār which is to prefer others over themselves even if they are in need of what they give and even though the One they prefer is unseen. They will ask you about orphans. Say: “To set their affairs aright; and if you intermix with them they are your brothers; Setting their state aright in teaching them discipline and manners taÌdīb is more perfect than setting aright their wealth. Patience in bearing with them by giving counsel and abandoning one's weariness in guiding them is better than being permissive to the point that it could be said that one did not uphold one's obligation toward them. God knows well him who works corruption from him who sets aright; and had He willed He would have harassed you. Surely God is Mighty Wise.” He deals with everyone according to the intentions quṣūd that dwell in a person's heart not according to the external things one acquires in vari- ous ways.

وَلاَ تَنْكِحُواْ ٱلْمُشْرِكَاتِ حَتَّىٰ يُؤْمِنَّ وَلأَمَةٌ مُّؤْمِنَةٌ خَيْرٌ مِّن مُّشْرِكَةٍ وَلَوْ أَعْجَبَتْكُمْ وَلاَ تُنْكِحُواْ ٱلْمُشِرِكِينَ حَتَّىٰ يُؤْمِنُواْ وَلَعَبْدٌ مُّؤْمِنٌ خَيْرٌ مِّن مُّشْرِكٍ وَلَوْ أَعْجَبَكُمْ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ يَدْعُونَ إِلَى ٱلنَّارِ وَٱللَّهُ يَدْعُوۤاْ إِلَى ٱلْجَنَّةِ وَٱلْمَغْفِرَةِ بِإِذْنِهِ وَيُبَيِّنُ آيَاتِهِ لِلنَّاسِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَذَكَّرُونَ,Do not marry idolatresses until they believe; a believing slave girl is better than an idolatress though you may admire her. And do not marry idolaters until they believe. A believing slave is better than an idolater though you may admire him. Those call to the fire; and God calls to paradise and pardon by His leave; and He makes clear His signs to the people so that they might remember. It is better to hold to the rope of religion and cling to the protection of Muslims than to be satisfied with someone [outside the faith] on a path that leads to disbelief. A concession in the law exists for this action but the deeper suggestion is to refrain and waive the right to choose it. This concerns the women of the Book with whom it is permissible to have mari- tal relations. As for polytheists it is absolutely prohibited to have marital relations with them. It is obligatory to cut off relations with those in this category-this is an irreversible decree.
وَيَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ ٱلْمَحِيضِ قُلْ هُوَ أَذًى فَٱعْتَزِلُواْ ٱلنِّسَآءَ فِي ٱلْمَحِيضِ وَلاَ تَقْرَبُوهُنَّ حَتَّىٰ يَطْهُرْنَ فَإِذَا تَطَهَّرْنَ فَأْتُوهُنَّ مِنْ حَيْثُ أَمَرَكُمُ ٱللَّهُ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُحِبُّ ٱلتَّوَّابِينَ وَيُحِبُّ ٱلْمُتَطَهِّرِينَ,They will ask you about the monthly period. Say: “It is an ailment; so part with women in the monthly period and do not approach them until they are pure; when they have cleansed themselves then come to them as God has commanded you.” Not everything which is a cause for embarrassment and aversion is some- thing the servant freely chooses for it might be among the imperfections which are not attributed to the servant but rather stem from a decree of the Real. Among these is what God has ordained for the daughters of Adam in [relation to] this condition. Moreover they were commanded to withdraw from the prayer carpet during the times of this condition since the prayer carpet is a place of intimate conversation with one's Lord. So setting a time in which the place of conversation is to be avoided is a decree from God not [because of any] sin of theirs. In this is an allusion for it is said that even if they cannot pray which [requires] being present through the body they are not prevented from perpetual remembrance dhikr in the heart and tongue. That [dhikr] is an address on the carpet of nearness. The Prophet ﷺ said relating from God most high “I sit among those who remember Me.” Truly God loves those who repent and He loves those who cleanse themselves. It is said that He loves those who repent from sins dhunūb and those who cleanse themselves from defects ʿuyūb. It is said that [it refers to] those who repent from error and those who cleanse themselves from imagining that their salvation is through repentance. It is said that [it refers to] those who repent from doing forbidden things and those who cleanse themselves from familiar things and considerations [of anything but God]. It is said that [it refers to] those who repent by seeking the water of for- giveness and those who cleanse themselves by pouring the water of shame [upon themselves] through the [human] attribute of brokenness. It is said that [it refers to] those who repent from error and those who cleanse themselves from heedlessness. It is said that [it refers to] those who repent from witnessing the repen- tance and those who cleanse themselves from imagining that anything is by error rather than by the decree that originates from God most high.
نِسَآؤُكُمْ حَرْثٌ لَّكُمْ فَأْتُواْ حَرْثَكُمْ أَنَّىٰ شِئْتُمْ وَقَدِّمُواْ لأَنْفُسِكُمْ وَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَٱعْلَمُوۤاْ أَنَّكُمْ مُّلاَقُوهُ وَبَشِّرِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,Your women are a tillage for you; so come to your tillage as you wish; and offer for your souls; and fear God; and know that you shall meet Him; and give good tidings to the believers. Because the bodily and lower selves are defined by absence from reality ḥaqīqa they find rest with their mates [and this] is allowable where it has been permitted. But when hearts are in the place of presence maḥall al-ḥuḌūr it is forbidden for them to be with created beings and anything other [than God]. And offer for your souls those righteous deeds that will benefit you on the day of your insolvency and because of this He said “and know that you shall meet Him.” So look to yourselves and offer what can be found that will ease your way before your Lord.
وَلاَ تَجْعَلُواْ ٱللَّهَ عُرْضَةً لأَيْمَانِكُمْ أَن تَبَرُّواْ وَتَتَّقُواْ وَتُصْلِحُواْ بَيْنَ ٱلنَّاسِ وَٱللَّهُ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ,Do not make God a hindrance in your oaths to be pious and God-fearing; and to put things right between people; surely God is All-Hearing Knower. Keep the mention of your Lord free of the banality of any worldly concerns. It is said “Do not make the mention of God into a net to catch the debris of this world.”
لاَّ يُؤَاخِذُكُمُ ٱللَّهُ بِٱلَّلغْوِ فِيۤ أَيْمَانِكُمْ وَلَـٰكِن يُؤَاخِذُكُم بِمَا كَسَبَتْ قُلُوبُكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ غَفُورٌ حَلِيمٌ,God will not take you to task for a slip in your oaths; but He will take you to task for what your hearts have earned; and God is Forgiving Forbearing. What the tongue says inadvertently does not have much importance either for good or bad but what is hidden in the recesses of the heart ḌamāÌir and contained in its inner secrets sarāÌir in [terms of] genuine intentions and strong resolutions-that will be taken into account. If it is good there will be a beautiful recompense jazāÌun jamīl and if it is bad there will be prolonged distress ʿanāÌun Ṭawīl.
لِّلَّذِينَ يُؤْلُونَ مِن نِّسَآئِهِمْ تَرَبُّصُ أَرْبَعَةِ أَشْهُرٍ فَإِنْ فَآءُو فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,For those who forswear their women a wait of four months; if they revert God is Forgiving Merciful. Though the right of companionship with one's mate is upheld for you- unless you relinquish it-you are nonetheless held to His rule for the right of the Real has even more right ḥaqqu al-ḥaqqi aḥaqqu to be observed. If they revert that is they turn back to revive what they have let die and rectify what they have squandered God is Forgiving Forbearing. Because the wife has a lesser voice because she is captive asīr in the hands of her spouse God سبحانه takes charge of the affair and preserves her right and commands the husband to return to her or release her.
وَإِنْ عَزَمُواْ ٱلطَّلاَقَ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ,But if they resolve upon divorce; surely God is Hearing Knowing. If he no longer wants the right of companionship and has confirmed his resolve to separate from her surely God is Hearing Knowing aware of his state and his secret. If any remorse comes to him he should not cover it up by denying356 the divorce for God سبحانه knows that he has divorced her. When separation is difficult [God] provides solace for the woman say- ing [He is] Hearing that is “We hear the one who is desolated by [the words of her husband] and this is a comfort for her from the Real سبحانه.”
وَٱلْمُطَلَّقَاتُ يَتَرَبَّصْنَ بِأَنْفُسِهِنَّ ثَلاَثَةَ قُرُوۤءٍ وَلاَ يَحِلُّ لَهُنَّ أَن يَكْتُمْنَ مَا خَلَقَ ٱللَّهُ فِيۤ أَرْحَامِهِنَّ إِن كُنَّ يُؤْمِنَّ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلآخِرِ وَبُعُولَتُهُنَّ أَحَقُّ بِرَدِّهِنَّ فِي ذَلِكَ إِنْ أَرَادُوۤاْ إِصْلاَحاً وَلَهُنَّ مِثْلُ ٱلَّذِي عَلَيْهِنَّ بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ وَلِلرِّجَالِ عَلَيْهِنَّ دَرَجَةٌ وَٱللَّهُ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ,Divorced women shall wait by themselves for three periods. He commanded divorced women to wait out of respect for spousal rela- tions. This means “If the relationship has been cut off between the two of you observe the condition of fulfilling [the waiting period] for the sake of what occurred in the past in the relationship. Do not put others quickly in place of [the former spouse]. Be patient until the allotted period has passed.” Do you not see that the bride whose marriage was not consum- mated is not commanded to undergo a waiting period since there were no spousal relations between the two of themḍ And it is not lawful for them to hide what God has created in their wombs if they believe in God and the Last Day. This means that even if the tie between the two of you has been severed do not sever what God has established in the parental relationship. Their mates have a better right to restore them This means that the one with the prior relationship [the husband who ini- tiated the divorce] has a better right to restore the breach in the marriage [before the wife's marrying again]. in such time if they desire to set things right; This means that the [husband's] intention to return should be to set things right in the estrangement that has occurred not to prolong the waiting period for her if he has decided to divorce her after he has taken her back. women shall have rights similar to those due from them with justice; This means if he has a right over her for what he has expended in wealth she has a right in the situation for [her] past service. but their men have a degree above them; God is Mighty Wise. [The man has the degree] in merit faḌīla but she has an advantage mazīya in weakness and human vulnerability.
ٱلطَّلَٰقُ مَرَّتَانِ فَإِمْسَاكٌ بِمَعْرُوفٍ أَوْ تَسْرِيحٌ بِإِحْسَٰنٍ وَلاَ يَحِلُّ لَكُمْ أَن تَأْخُذُواْ مِمَّآ آتَيْتُمُوهُنَّ شَيْئاً إِلاَّ أَن يَخَافَآ أَلاَّ يُقِيمَا حُدُودَ ٱللَّهِ فَإِنْ خِفْتُمْ أَلاَّ يُقِيمَا حُدُودَ ٱللَّهِ فَلاَ جُنَاحَ عَلَيْهِمَا فِيمَا ٱفْتَدَتْ بِهِ تِلْكَ حُدُودُ ٱللَّهِ فَلاَ تَعْتَدُوهَا وَمَن يَتَعَدَّ حُدُودَ ٱللَّهِ فَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلظَّٰلِمُونَ,Divorce is twice; [God] calls for the divorce formula to be separate so that you will not rush to complete the separation. Regarding its meaning it is said; If I discover that you have resolved on slaying me then leave me. Little by little I am becoming weaker. then honorable retention; or setting free kindly. That is [there should] either be a gracious relationship or a gracious separa- tion. A bad marital life and the loss of pleasantries because of blameworthy character traits are not acceptable on the path Ṭarīqa nor are they con- sidered praiseworthy in the law sharīʿa. not lawful for you to take of what you have given them For surely the report is “Anyone who asks for his gift back is like some- one asking for his own vomit” and to return what you have ruined is contemptible. unless the couple fear that they may not maintain God's bounds. If you fear they may not maintain God's bounds neither of them would be at fault if she were to ransom herself. This means that if the woman wants to free herself from her husband she is not at fault for giving wealth [in exchange] for truly the self is worth everything to its owner. If the man when he loses the companionship of the woman could receive something from her then at least he would receive some wealth for the loss of comfort in the situation. Those are God's bounds; do not transgress them. Whoever transgresses God's bounds-those are the evildoers. These are the good manners ādāb that God has taught you and made as a way sunna for you so be mindful of his bounds ḥudūd and persist in recognizing His just claims ḥuqūq.
فَإِنْ طَلَّقَهَا فَلاَ تَحِلُّ لَهُ مِن بَعْدُ حَتَّىٰ تَنْكِحَ زَوْجاً غَيْرَهُ فَإِن طَلَّقَهَا فَلاَ جُنَاحَ عَلَيْهِمَآ أَن يَتَرَاجَعَآ إِن ظَنَّآ أَن يُقِيمَا حُدُودَ ٱللَّهِ وَتِلْكَ حُدُودُ ٱللَّهِ يُبَيِّنُهَا لِقَوْمٍ يَعْلَمُونَ,If he divorces her she shall not be lawful to him after that until she marries another husband. If he divorces her then neither of them would be at fault [if they] return to each other A man finds it unbearable for his wife to marry another so [God] prevents him from choosing separation with the intention of keeping her from remarrying. He explains that once he has separated from her she will not be lawful for him until she does what he would find unbearable and that is a second marriage. So [this will make him] cautious as much as he is able in [initiating] divorce. Then He said “If he divorces her” meaning the spouse “then neither of them would be at fault [if they] return to each other” meaning if she remarries the first husband. Here the allusion is that love's hold on the heart makes what would otherwise be hard to endure easy for if after separating the spouses regret their lost union and then feel the greatest remorse there is no fault in their returning to each other. But the woman in this circumstance is protected from her husband by the threat of another husband for the husband would himself be making that possible [if he were to divorce her three times]. if they think that they will maintain God's bounds. Those are God's bounds which He makes clear to a people who have knowledge. This means that after they know how much they need each other as com- panions they will not separate again. The one who spoke for them said: I swore that if I were to meet you one more time I would never separate from you a second time.
وَإِذَا طَلَّقْتُمُ ٱلنِّسَآءَ فَبَلَغْنَ أَجَلَهُنَّ فَأَمْسِكُوهُنَّ بِمَعْرُوفٍ أَوْ سَرِّحُوهُنَّ بِمَعْرُوفٍ وَلاَ تُمْسِكُوهُنَّ ضِرَاراً لِّتَعْتَدُواْ وَمَن يَفْعَلْ ذَلِكَ فَقَدْ ظَلَمَ نَفْسَهُ وَلاَ تَتَّخِذُوۤاْ آيَاتِ ٱللَّهِ هُزُواً وَٱذْكُرُواْ نِعْمَتَ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ وَمَآ أَنزَلَ عَلَيْكُمْ مِّنَ ٱلْكِتَابِ وَٱلْحِكْمَةِ يَعِظُكُمْ بِهِ وَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَٱعْلَمُوۤاْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عَلِيمٌ,When you divorce women and they have reached their term then retain them honorably or set them free honorably; do not retain them in order to hurt [them]; whoever does that has wronged his soul; take not God's verses in mockery and remember God's grace upon you and the Book and the wisdom He has revealed to you to exhort you therewith; and fear God and know that God has knowledge of all things. The verse contains the command to goodly marital relations which means abandoning anger and stubborn bickering with the wife. So either release [her] without being rough min ghayri jafāÌ or practice true companion- ship as it should be carried out ʿalā sharṬi al-wafāÌ.
وَإِذَا طَلَّقْتُمُ ٱلنِّسَآءَ فَبَلَغْنَ أَجَلَهُنَّ فَلاَ تَعْضُلُوهُنَّ أَن يَنكِحْنَ أَزْوَاجَهُنَّ إِذَا تَرَاضَوْاْ بَيْنَهُمْ بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ ذٰلِكَ يُوعَظُ بِهِ مَن كَانَ مِنكُمْ يُؤْمِنُ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلآخِرِ ذٰلِكُمْ أَزْكَىٰ لَكُمْ وَأَطْهَرُ وَٱللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ وَأَنْتُمْ لاَ تَعْلَمُونَ,When you divorce women and they have reached their term do not debar them from marrying their [former] husbands when they have agreed together honorably. That is an admonition for whoever of you believe in God and the Last Day; that is purer for you and cleaner. God knows and you know not. The verse contains a prohibition for guardians against hurting [the women under their protection] abandoning the fierceness of the time of ignorance jāhiliyya and yielding to the decree of God to allow [divorced] women to marry if they wish it without indignation or rage. Rather [the mes- sage is] “since you were sufficiently pleased to betroth her to a mate it is prohibited to [then] oppress her.” Letting go of the [baser] human instincts by subjugating the lower self is a more difficult struggle [than the fierce ways of the time of ignorance] and a more sincere way of behaving for the sake of God.
وَٱلْوَالِدَاتُ يُرْضِعْنَ أَوْلاَدَهُنَّ حَوْلَيْنِ كَامِلَيْنِ لِمَنْ أَرَادَ أَن يُتِمَّ ٱلرَّضَاعَةَ وَعلَى ٱلْمَوْلُودِ لَهُ رِزْقُهُنَّ وَكِسْوَتُهُنَّ بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ لاَ تُكَلَّفُ نَفْسٌ إِلاَّ وُسْعَهَا لاَ تُضَآرَّ وَالِدَةٌ بِوَلَدِهَا وَلاَ مَوْلُودٌ لَّهُ بِوَلَدِهِ وَعَلَى ٱلْوَارِثِ مِثْلُ ذٰلِكَ فَإِنْ أَرَادَا فِصَالاً عَن تَرَاضٍ مِّنْهُمَا وَتَشَاوُرٍ فَلاَ جُنَاحَ عَلَيْهِمَا وَإِنْ أَرَدتُّمْ أَن تَسْتَرْضِعُوۤاْ أَوْلاَدَكُمْ فَلاَ جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ إِذَا سَلَّمْتُم مَّآ آتَيْتُم بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ وَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَٱعْلَمُوۤاْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ,Mothers suckle their children for two full years for such as desire to fulfill the suckling. The ultimate metaphor for mercy is the mercy of mothers. God سبحانه com- manded mothers to fulfill mercy by suckling their children for two complete years. Cutting off the suckling before two years [for those who so desire] is an allusion to the fact that the mercy of God toward his servant is more perfect than the mercy of mothers. It is for the father to provide them and clothe them honorably. This means that the father must provide for nursing women and clothe them honorably. When they are performing an act for you their right is your obligation. Surely the [child] who is entirely yours is entirely your responsibility. No soul is charged save to its capacity; The holding back of one with ability is miserliness-to stop in a moment of weakness is a [poor] excuse. a mother shall not be harmed by her child in the suckling and what is necessary for it. neither a father by his child. The heir has a similar duty. This means that the father [shall not be harmed] by his child that is with regard to the support and tenderness that are obligatory for [the child]. Just as the right of the child is incumbent on the parents the right of the parents is incumbent on the child. َ But if the two desire by mutual consent and consultation to wean [the child] then they would not be at fault. And if you desire to seek [others to] nurse your children you would not be at fault provided you hand over what you have given honorably and fear God and know that God sees what you do. This refers to weaning before two years-if it is done with the right inten- tion there is no fault. The verse includes [that which] smooths the path of companionship and teaches the best moral qualities in the precepts of marital life. Surely those who are not merciful will not themselves be treated with mercy wa-inna man lā yarḥamu lā yurḥamu. The Prophet ﷺ said to someone who mentioned that his children did not kiss him “Surely God does not take away mercy except from a miserable heart.”
وَٱلَّذِينَ يُتَوَفَّوْنَ مِنكُمْ وَيَذَرُونَ أَزْوَاجاً يَتَرَبَّصْنَ بِأَنْفُسِهِنَّ أَرْبَعَةَ أَشْهُرٍ وَعَشْراً فَإِذَا بَلَغْنَ أَجَلَهُنَّ فَلاَ جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ فِيمَا فَعَلْنَ فِيۤ أَنْفُسِهِنَّ بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ وَٱللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيرٌ,And those of you who pass away leaving wives they shall wait by themselves for four months and ten. When they have reached their term then you would not be at fault regarding what they may do with themselves honorably; God is aware of what you do. Because the right of the dead is more important since his separation is not by choice the period [for the widow] to complete used to be longer. In the beginning of Islam the waiting period after death was one year. However it reverted to four months and ten days [the time necessary] to verify that no sperm of the husband is present in the womb. When the waiting period comes to an end [the widow] is permitted to marry another man. No one's fidelity lasts to the end of life as it is said: Just as faces decay in the ground so does the grief of [women].
وَلاَ جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ فِيمَا عَرَّضْتُمْ بِهِ مِنْ خِطْبَةِ ٱلنِّسَآءِ أَوْ أَكْنَنتُمْ فِيۤ أَنْفُسِكُمْ عَلِمَ ٱللَّهُ أَنَّكُمْ سَتَذْكُرُونَهُنَّ وَلَـٰكِن لاَّ تُوَاعِدُوهُنَّ سِرّاً إِلاَّ أَن تَقُولُواْ قَوْلاً مَّعْرُوفاً وَلاَ تَعْزِمُوۤاْ عُقْدَةَ ٱلنِّكَاحِ حَتَّىٰ يَبْلُغَ ٱلْكِتَابُ أَجَلَهُ وَٱعْلَمُوۤاْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَعْلَمُ مَا فِيۤ أَنْفُسِكُمْ فَٱحْذَرُوهُ وَٱعْلَمُوۤاْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ حَلِيمٌ,You would not be at fault regarding the proposal you present or hide in your hearts to women. God knows that you will be mindful of them; but do not make arrangements with them secretly unless you speak honorable words. This permits seeking affection and laying the foundation for [marital] union. It forbids doing prohibited sinful acts or preparing for such acts. And do not resolve on the knot of marriage until that which is written has reached its term; and know that God knows what is in your souls; so be fearful of Him; and know that God is Forgiving Forbearing. That is the waiting period for the first [marriage] is required to avoid any disrespect for the deceased.
لاَّ جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ إِن طَلَّقْتُمُ ٱلنِّسَآءَ مَا لَمْ تَمَسُّوهُنَّ أَوْ تَفْرِضُواْ لَهُنَّ فَرِيضَةً وَمَتِّعُوهُنَّ عَلَى ٱلْمُوسِعِ قَدَرُهُ وَعَلَى ٱلْمُقْتِرِ قَدَرُهُ مَتَاعاً بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ حَقّاً عَلَى ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,You would not be at fault if you divorce women whom you have not touched nor appointed any obligation for them; yet make provision of com- forts for them honorably the one of ample means according to his means and the needy man according to his means-an obligation on the virtuous. If you have initiated366 the union with your mates but then change your mind [before the consummation] there is no fault on you if you choose separation for there is only One from whom it is not permissible to choose to separate. The companionship of human beings with one another is not obligatory but rather is described at most as permissible. But367 because your name and reputation are now part of theirs half of the determined amount [of the dowry] must belong to them since separation-however it comes about-is difficult. So [God] has established the required compensa- tion for [the woman] who is made to drink from the cup of separation. If there was no determined amount the contract still requires the gift mutaʿ because her being made to drink from the cup of separation without [some compensatory] comfort is a terrible thing for her to suffer.
وَإِن طَلَّقْتُمُوهُنَّ مِن قَبْلِ أَن تَمَسُّوهُنَّ وَقَدْ فَرَضْتُمْ لَهُنَّ فَرِيضَةً فَنِصْفُ مَا فَرَضْتُمْ إِلاَّ أَن يَعْفُونَ أَوْ يَعْفُوَاْ ٱلَّذِي بِيَدِهِ عُقْدَةُ ٱلنِّكَاحِ وَأَن تَعْفُوۤاْ أَقْرَبُ لِلتَّقْوَىٰ وَلاَ تَنسَوُاْ ٱلْفَضْلَ بَيْنَكُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ,And if you divorce them before you have touched them but you have already settled a dower on them then one half of what you have appointed unless it be that they make remission or he makes remission the one in whose hand is the knot of marriage; yet that you should remit is nearer to piety. Then [God] mentions that remission is more perfect and more commend- able either on the part of the woman in the half due to her or from the husband in the half returned to him. Forget not kindness between you; surely God sees what you do. It is said that whoever lacks kindness faḌl368 and is content with the obligatory will soon neglect the obligatory [as well]. It is said that to forget kindness is to become ever more niggardly. Part of the way of noble people sunnat al-kirām is that even when there are no obvious occasions for acting with nobility they nonetheless sharpen the eyes of generosity and look for more subtle opportunities to act with kindness-and they are given many such opportunities.
حَافِظُواْ عَلَى ٱلصَّلَوَٰتِ وٱلصَّلَٰوةِ ٱلْوُسْطَىٰ وَقُومُواْ للَّهِ قَٰنِتِينَ,Maintain ḥāfiẓū the prayers and the middle prayer and stand sub- missive to God. Maintaining muḥāfaẓa the prayers means coming to them with awe and leaving with reverence and seeking a state of perpetual witnessing in the proper manner. The middle prayer is mentioned without being clearly defined so that you will observe each of them thinking it is the one [men- tioned] and will not neglect any [of them].
فَإنْ خِفْتُمْ فَرِجَالاً أَوْ رُكْبَاناً فَإِذَآ أَمِنتُمْ فَٱذْكُرُواْ ٱللَّهَ كَمَا عَلَّمَكُم مَّا لَمْ تَكُونُواْ تَعْلَمُونَ,And if you are in fear then standing or mounted. But when you are secure then remember God as He taught you what you knew not. That is “Do not abandon intimate conversations with Me at their [desig- nated] times in the way I have made possible for you for truly I am the One who gives power over you to the enemies you fear. But when you withdraw in your hearts through Me their hands will be unable to reach you since I have appointed victory for you over them. Then when the fear is gone from you and you are secure return to what you have established [in prayers] and exert your utmost in the times of your devotion in My presence in private or in public.”
وَٱلَّذِينَ يُتَوَفَّوْنَ مِنكُمْ وَيَذَرُونَ أَزْوَاجاً وَصِيَّةً لأَزْوَاجِهِمْ مَّتَاعاً إِلَى ٱلْحَوْلِ غَيْرَ إِخْرَاجٍ فَإِنْ خَرَجْنَ فَلاَ جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ فِي مَا فَعَلْنَ فِيۤ أَنْفُسِهِنَّ مِن مَّعْرُوفٍ وَٱللَّهُ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ,And those of you who die leaving wives make testament for their wives provision for a year; but if they go forth you would not be at fault regarding what they may do with themselves honorably; God is Mighty Wise. The waiting period after the death of the husband in the beginning of Islam was an uninterrupted year according to the words and actions of the Arabs. With respect to that the one who spoke for them said: Until the end of the year then “peace be upon both of you.” Whoever weeps for an entire year has absolved themselves of any guilt. Then this was abrogated [and made] four months and ten days since the mourning period inevitably ends. The one who spoke for them said: He said “If you die I cannot live.” I said “You are being hypocritical so be silent. What living thing do you see that dies from love for something which is deadḍ”
وَلِلْمُطَلَّقَاتِ مَتَاعٌ بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ حَقّاً عَلَى ٱلْمُتَّقِينَ,There shall be provision for divorced women honorably-an obliga- tion on those who fear. The allusion is that you [men ]should not combine separation with depriva- tion thereby doubling the difficulty for them [women].
كَذَلِكَ يُبَيِّنُ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمْ آيَاتِهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ,So God makes clear His signs for you so that you might understand. “[These are] guideposts dalāÌil so learn refined behavior through what has been pointed out to you-you will prosper by that which you come to understand from the allusions ishārāt of My decree.”
أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى ٱلَّذِينَ خَرَجُواْ مِن دِيَٰرِهِمْ وَهُمْ أُلُوفٌ حَذَرَ ٱلْمَوْتِ فَقَالَ لَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ مُوتُواْ ثُمَّ أَحْيَٰهُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَذُو فَضْلٍ عَلَى ٱلنَّاسِ وَلَـٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ ٱلنَّاسِ لاَ يَشْكُرُونَ,Have you not seen those thousands who went forth from their habi- tations fearful of deathḍ God said to them “Die!” Then He gave them life. Truly God is bounteous [dhū faḌl] to people but most people are not thankful. When [the children of Israel] deemed God's power to restore [them] unlikely He showed [His power] to them directly in their own selves. The outward disclosure of that however did not benefit those who had not sharpened their insight regarding divine unity tawḥīd. Anyone whose insight has been strengthened will not be harmed by a lack of these direct forms of evidence for they have already realized through their faith in the unseen the truth of what they have been told.
وَقَٰتِلُواْ فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ وَٱعْلَمُوۤاْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ,So fight in God's way and know that God is Hearing Knowing. This means “If pain touches you and a cry rises up from you know that God hears your cry knows your states and sees your affairs.” The verse brings about an easing of the pain they endure. They said: While most people want ease and comfort I wish to complain to you for then you will hear.
مَّن ذَا ٱلَّذِي يُقْرِضُ ٱللَّهَ قَرْضاً حَسَناً فَيُضَٰعِفَهُ لَهُ أَضْعَافاً كَثِيرَةً وَٱللَّهُ يَقْبِضُ وَيَبْسُطُ وَإِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ,Who is he that will lend God a loan that is good and He will multiply it for him manifoldḍ The loan is called qarḌ because one “cuts off ” yaqṬaʿu something from one's wealth in order to give it to a borrower. When the almsgiver “cuts” alms ṣadaqa from his wealth his gift is called a qarḌ. The qarḌ then is the amount cut off. But here the term is being used in a way that preserves the hearts of the lovers inasmuch as [God] uses it to speak directly to you on the subject of almsgiving. It is said that the verse suggests the importance of the wealthy since He questioned them about the loan but the rank of the poor is even more important in this [verse] because He asked about the loan on their behalf. [God] might ask for the loan from anyone but He did not ask it for the sake of just anyone. In the tradition: “The Messenger of God ﷺ died while his coat of mail had been pawned with Abū Shaḥma the Jew for barley which he had taken to feed his family.” Look from whom he borrowed and for the sake of whom he borrowed! It is said that the good loan is one for which you do not look for a reward and do not seek recompense. It is said that the good loan is not given in a heedless way but rather from witnessing [what is needed]. It is said that the good loan according to religious scholars is given only when one has the means. [But] according to the most respected al-akābir [the good loan] is the condition of preferring others [to one's self] in giving without any hesitation. It is said that the good loan according to the religious scholars is 2.5 percent. According to the folk it is giving everything generously including one's spirit. God straitens yaqbiḌ and enlarges yabsuṬ; and to Him you shall be returned. [God] takes hold yaqbiḌ of the alms from the rich with the grasp qabḌ of His acceptance and opens yabsuṬ for them the largesse basṬ of His compensation. It is said that He straitens yaqbiḌ the provision that is “He restricts” yuḌayyiqu; and He enlarges the provision that is “He expands” yuwassiʿu.
أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى ٱلْمَلإِ مِن بَنِيۤ إِسْرَائِيلَ مِن بَعْدِ مُوسَىۤ إِذْ قَالُواْ لِنَبِيٍّ لَّهُمُ ٱبْعَثْ لَنَا مَلِكاً نُّقَاتِلْ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ قَالَ هَلْ عَسَيْتُمْ إِن كُتِبَ عَلَيْكُمُ ٱلْقِتَالُ أَلاَّ تُقَاتِلُواْ قَالُواْ وَمَا لَنَآ أَلاَّ نُقَاتِلَ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ وَقَدْ أُخْرِجْنَا مِن دِيَارِنَا وَأَبْنَآئِنَا فَلَمَّا كُتِبَ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلْقِتَالُ تَوَلَّوْاْ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً مِّنْهُمْ وَٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ بِٱلظَّالِمِينَ,Have you not seen the council of the children of Israel after Moses when they said to a prophet of theirs “Send for us a king and we will fight in God's way.” He said “Might it be that if fighting is prescribed for you you will not fightḍ” They said “Why should we not fight in God's way when we have been expelled from our habitations and our childrenḍ” Yet when fighting was prescribed for them they turned their backs except a few of them; and God has knowledge of the evildoers. They approached the matter as one of free choice ikhtiyār demanding that their prophet ask permission for them to fight. When they were granted that for which they were themselves responsible they stopped short out of laziness takāsul and changed their course toward the homelands of desertion takhādhul and indifference taghāful. It is said that outwardly they spoke with toughness and seriousness about fighting to defend their possessions and their dwellings when they said “Why should we not fight in God's way when we have been expelled from our habitations and our childrenḍ” But they did not achieve their objective because their resolve was not purely for the right of God. If they had said “Why should we not fight in the way of God for He has commanded us and made [this] an obligation on usḍ He is our Chief and Protector and His command is binding on us” then perhaps they would have fully achieved what they had set out to do.
وَقَالَ لَهُمْ نَبِيُّهُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ قَدْ بَعَثَ لَكُمْ طَالُوتَ مَلِكاً قَالُوۤاْ أَنَّىٰ يَكُونُ لَهُ ٱلْمُلْكُ عَلَيْنَا وَنَحْنُ أَحَقُّ بِٱلْمُلْكِ مِنْهُ وَلَمْ يُؤْتَ سَعَةً مِّنَ ٱلْمَالِ قَالَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ ٱصْطَفَاهُ عَلَيْكُمْ وَزَادَهُ بَسْطَةً فِي ٱلْعِلْمِ وَٱلْجِسْمِ وَٱللَّهُ يُؤْتِي مُلْكَهُ مَن يَشَآءُ وَٱللَّهُ وَاسِعٌ عَلِيمٌ,Then their prophet said to them “Verily God has raised up Saul for you as king.” They said “How can he be king over us when we have better right than he to kingship seeing he has not been given amplitude of wealthḍ” He said “God has chosen him over you and has increased him broadly in knowledge and body jism. God gives the kingship to whom He will; and God is Embracing Knowing. They forgot [God's] right of free choice ikhtiyār and viewed the situation instead with the eye of the external world. They deemed it unlikely that Saul could be a king because he was poor and without property. [God] explained to them that merit is by the choice of the Real and that if [Saul] lacked wealth “God has increased him in knowledge and has favored him over you by his knowledge and body jism.” It is said that He meant that [Saul] was praiseworthy in the qualities of the self nafs not large in [his] physical frame binya for as it is said in the adage “So and so is a name without a body fulān ism bi-lā jism” that is a man without substance.
وَقَالَ لَهُمْ نِبِيُّهُمْ إِنَّ آيَةَ مُلْكِهِ أَن يَأْتِيَكُمُ ٱلتَّابُوتُ فِيهِ سَكِينَةٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَبَقِيَّةٌ مِّمَّا تَرَكَ آلُ مُوسَىٰ وَآلُ هَارُونَ تَحْمِلُهُ ٱلْمَلاۤئِكَةُ إِنَّ فِي ذَلِكَ لآيَةً لَّكُمْ إِن كُنْتُم مُّؤْمِنِينَ,And their prophet said to them “The sign of his kingship is that there will come to you the ark. Therein is a spirit of peace from your Lord and a remnant of what the folk of Moses and the folk of Aaron left behind the angels bearing it. Surely in that shall be a sign for you if you are believers.” Verily when God سبحانه makes a light appear He increases [that light] with the aid He provides directly from Himself. When Saul was made king over them the doubt about his qualification was eliminated by the appearance of [God's] signs that proved the veracity of the words of their prophet [declaring God's choice of Saul]. He returned the ark which contained the spirit of peace sakīna to them. Thus the sign of his kingship became clear to them with the fact that their prophet عليه السلام had spoken truly to them in what he told them. It is said that God most high placed the spirit of peace sakīna of the children of Israel in the ark that contained the shards of the tablets and the rod of Moses عليه السلام and [other] relics of their prophets. He placed the spirit of peace of [Muḥammad's] community in their hearts: He it is who sent down the spirit of peace into the hearts of the believers [48:4]. Moreover the ark circulated in the hands of enemies and others. One time it was buried another time it was seized and carried away another time it was returned and another time [and so on... ]. But as for the hearts of the believers-[God] comes between the possessors [of these hearts] and [the spirit of peace]. He did not entrust it to a king or a prophet or to the heavens or air or to a place or person. The Prophet ﷺ said “The heart of the believer is between the two fingers of the Merciful” meaning in the grasp of the Real سبحانه and under His domination taghlīb and disposal taṣrīf. This means it is the divine power of deliberation qudra. What a difference between a community whose spirit of peace is in what enemies can control and a community whose spirit of peace is in that over which no created being has any control!
فَلَمَّا فَصَلَ طَالُوتُ بِٱلْجُنُودِ قَالَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ مُبْتَلِيكُمْ بِنَهَرٍ فَمَن شَرِبَ مِنْهُ فَلَيْسَ مِنِّي وَمَن لَّمْ يَطْعَمْهُ فَإِنَّهُ مِنِّيۤ إِلاَّ مَنِ ٱغْتَرَفَ غُرْفَةً بِيَدِهِ فَشَرِبُواْ مِنْهُ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً مِّنْهُمْ فَلَمَّا جَاوَزَهُ هُوَ وَٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ مَعَهُ قَالُواْ لاَ طَاقَةَ لَنَا ٱلْيَوْمَ بِجَالُوتَ وَجُنودِهِ قَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ يَظُنُّونَ أَنَّهُمْ مُلاَقُواْ ٱللَّهِ كَم مِّن فِئَةٍ قَلِيلَةٍ غَلَبَتْ فِئَةً كَثِيرَةً بِإِذْنِ ٱللَّهِ وَٱللَّهُ مَعَ ٱلصَّابِرِينَ,And when Saul went forth with the hosts he said “God will try you with a river; whoever drinks of it is not of me and whoever tastes it not he is of me except for him who scoops up with his hand. The allusion in this verse is that God سبحانه tests human beings in their association with others with this world and with the lower self. There are some whose association with these things is limited to that which is required for [them to earn a] basic livelihood and what is necessary for their salvation and security. There are others who go beyond the limit of what is required and extend their association with things of the world self and creation for the sake of carnal desire and their own preference. There is nothing from God in that which involves doing a prohibited thing. There is nothing from this path Ṭarīqa in that which involves holding on to more than what is needed. But they drank of it except a few of them; Likewise the elect in every moment are few in their number but sublime in their worth. and when he crossed it with those who believed they said “We have no power today against Goliath and his troops.” They viewed the situation with the eye of the external world and were overcome with mortal fright. God fortified their hearts telling them that the Real سبحانه helps His friends if He wills it. Those who thought they would meet God said “How often a small company has overcome a numerous one by God's leave; and God is with the patient.” [The victory is] not by them but by the permission of God through what He has willed and through His aid and His help. God is with the patient through help support and strength.
وَلَمَّا بَرَزُواْ لِجَالُوتَ وَجُنُودِهِ قَالُواْ رَبَّنَآ أَفْرِغْ عَلَيْنَا صَبْراً وَثَبِّتْ أَقْدَامَنَا وَٱنْصُرْنَا عَلَى ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلْكَافِرِينَ,So when they went forth against Goliath and his troops they said “Our Lord pour out upon us patience and make firm our feet and grant us victory over the disbelieving folk!” So when they went forth against Goliath and his troops [the hosts of Saul] exonerated themselves of all power and strength and turned to God seek- ing His succor asking for His aid and trusting in His help. They said “Our Lord pour out upon us patience and make firm our feet. First they sought firmness and patience for the sake of the sufferings they had previously endured and then they said “and grant us victory over the disbelieving folk!” The most important of their concerns was patience and standing up to the enemy and only after that [were they concerned for] help for themselves. Patience [in enduring sufferings] is the right of the Real ḥaqq al-ḥaqq while help is their portion. They stepped forward to assert His right سبحانه and to succeed for His sake and then to find their worldly portion from [His] help. Moreover [the hosts of Saul] indicated that they were seeking help against [the enemy] not out of revenge for what had been taken from them but because they [the enemy] were disbelievers enemies of God. The [hosts of Saul] stood in every way for God through God. Because of that they were helped and found victory.
فَهَزَمُوهُمْ بِإِذْنِ ٱللَّهِ وَقَتَلَ دَاوُدُ جَالُوتَ وَآتَاهُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْمُلْكَ وَٱلْحِكْمَةَ وَعَلَّمَهُ مِمَّا يَشَآءُ وَلَوْلاَ دَفْعُ ٱللَّهِ ٱلنَّاسَ بَعْضَهُمْ بِبَعْضٍ لَفَسَدَتِ ٱلأَرْضُ وَلَـٰكِنَّ ٱللَّهَ ذُو فَضْلٍ عَلَى ٱلْعَالَمِينَ,And they routed them by the leave of God and David slew Goliath; and God gave him the kingship and wisdom and He taught him such as He willed. God frightened the enemies with Saul whom He had given such a large body. But at the time of the fighting He brought the victory about through the hands of David. As the story goes [David] was of middling stature not large in body a compact person. He had no weapon with him but a slingshot; the victory was his because the help of God سبحانه was with him. And they routed them by the leave of God so that nothing not even a trace remained of them. David killed Goliath. Because of Goliath's bulk and size David's victory over him was unimaginable but as the one who spoke for them said: He met me with his sword drawn and said to me One of us is gone. Had God not repelled people some by means of others the earth would have surely been corrupted; but God is bounteous to all worlds. If mankind were to make common cause and agree with one another alto- gether the weak would be destroyed by the victory of the strong. But He keeps some occupied by others so as to deflect their evil from other people.
تِلْكَ آيَاتُ ٱللَّهِ نَتْلُوهَا عَلَيْكَ بِٱلْحَقِّ وَإِنَّكَ لَمِنَ ٱلْمُرْسَلِينَ,These are the verses of God We recite to you in truth and assuredly you are one of the Messengers [of God]. “You did not have knowledge [O Muḥammad] regarding these long ago beings from the past nor was this something you devised. Rather you came to know of them through information given by God سبحانه.”
تِلْكَ ٱلرُّسُلُ فَضَّلْنَا بَعْضَهُمْ عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ مِّنْهُمْ مَّن كَلَّمَ ٱللَّهُ وَرَفَعَ بَعْضَهُمْ دَرَجَاتٍ وَآتَيْنَا عِيسَى ٱبْنَ مَرْيَمَ ٱلْبَيِّنَاتِ وَأَيَّدْنَاهُ بِرُوحِ ٱلْقُدُسِ وَلَوْ شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ مَا ٱقْتَتَلَ ٱلَّذِينَ مِن بَعْدِهِم مِّن بَعْدِ مَا جَآءَتْهُمُ ٱلْبَيِّنَاتُ وَلَـٰكِنِ ٱخْتَلَفُواْ فَمِنْهُمْ مَّنْ آمَنَ وَمِنْهُمْ مَّن كَفَرَ وَلَوْ شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ مَا ٱقْتَتَلُواْ وَلَـٰكِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَفْعَلُ مَا يُرِيدُ,Those messengers some We have preferred above others; there are some to whom God spoke and some He raised in rank. And We gave Jesus son of Mary the clear proofs and confirmed him with the Holy Spirit. In the message they were united but they differed in the specific details. Each one has lights and their lights have places where they are cast. Among them is one who is the most sublime in terms of light and most perfect in rank and intensity. Their virtues are not entitlements based on their actions and states but rather are a goodly decree that came to them ḥukmun bi-l- ḥusnā adrakahum and a beautiful succession that reached them in turns wa-ʿāqibatun bi-l-jamīli tadārakathum. And had God willed those who came after them would not have fought against one another after the clear proofs had come to them; but they fell into variance and some of them believed and some disbelieved and had God willed they would not have fought against one another but God does whatever He desires. They are made to turn about by the eternal will and have been stripped of free choice; [instead there is the divine choice] around which everything circles madār and by which is the crossing over iʿtibār. Servanthood is the tight- ening of the belt of service khidma and the witnessing of prior fate qisma.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُوۤاْ أَنْفِقُواْ مِمَّا رَزَقْنَٰكُم مِّن قَبْلِ أَن يَأْتِيَ يَوْمٌ لاَّ بَيْعٌ فِيهِ وَلاَ خُلَّةٌ وَلاَ شَفَاعَةٌ وَٱلْكَٰفِرُونَ هُمُ ٱلظَّٰلِمُونَ,O you who believe expend of what We have provided you with before there comes a day in which there shall be neither commerce nor friendship nor intercession. And the disbelievers-they are the evildoers. This means [one should] take advantage of the help [one is] granted-the ability to act virtuously-before [one's] strength flags and one's allotted time passes.
ٱللَّهُ لاَ إِلَـٰهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ ٱلْحَيُّ ٱلْقَيُّومُ لاَ تَأْخُذُهُ سِنَةٌ وَلاَ نَوْمٌ لَّهُ مَا فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِي ٱلأَرْضِ مَن ذَا ٱلَّذِي يَشْفَعُ عِنْدَهُ إِلاَّ بِإِذْنِهِ يَعْلَمُ مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ وَلاَ يُحِيطُونَ بِشَيْءٍ مِّنْ عِلْمِهِ إِلاَّ بِمَا شَآءَ وَسِعَ كُرْسِيُّهُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضَ وَلاَ يَؤُودُهُ حِفْظُهُمَا وَهُوَ ٱلْعَلِيُّ ٱلْعَظِيمُ,God there is no god except Him the Living the Eternal Sustainer. Allāh is a name ism which only the Real سبحانه possesses and no one can be His namesake samī-God most high said “Do you know [of] anyone who could be His namesakeḍ” [19:65] that is “Do you know anyone other than Him that could be called Allāhḍ” Anyone who regards this as a derived term is like someone lost in his own contradictions. This is a term that denotes worthiness of the attributes of majesty not derivation from [other] words. There are no parallels for what has no parallel in words. His words there is no god except Him is a statement that negates any- thing equivalent or similar to that of which He is worthy in [terms of] sanc- tity taqdīs and incomparability tanzīh. Anyone who realizes the truth of this statement will not see so much as a speck to affirm in anything other than Him or from anything other than Him so he will not bring up his need before any other nor bear witness to a speck of anything other than Him. His concentration on Him will be steady and his singular devotion to finding Him will be perpetual. So he does not hear except from God and through God and he does not witness anything except through God and he does not approach anything but God and he does not occupy himself with anything except through God. He is effaced from what is other than God and therefore he has no complaints or requests. Not a drop of blood flows in him for anything other than [God]. When the Real gives to a ser- vant in full measure there is absolutely no room left in him for any worldly concerns. Surely then the truth of this statement [there is no god except Him] must be acknowledged and all other ways of describing things [must] cease. The truth to be realized is that no creature has access to the existence of the Real سبحانه; [there is] no union or parting no nearness or distance for truly those are all accidents which are not worthy of the timeless eternal. The Living ḥayy the Eternal Sustainer qayyūm: The One who takes charge mutawallī of the affairs of His servants the One who con- cerns Himself with every movement and stillness the One who sets in motion396 every entity ʿayn and effect athar.

The arguments are clear and the proofs plain and evident. Rectitude has become clear from error; The night is distinguished by its darkness from the day and its light. The eternal truths ḥuqūq [of the Real] are given facts while the basic limits ḥudūd [of created things] are subject to other causes. [The truths of the Real] are [known] through the property of timeless eternity naʿt al-qidam while [the limits of created things] are [known] through the attribute of privation waṣf al-ʿadam. so whoever disbelieves in the false deity The false deity is anything that distracts one from his Lord. and believes in God Belief is the life of the heart ḥayāt al-qalb through God. has laid hold of the most firm handle Laying hold of the most firm handle is holding to the command and pro- hibition al-amr wa-l-nahy which is traveling the path of al-MuṣṬafā ﷺ. unbreaking; God is Hearing Knowing. Anyone who realizes the truth of it inwardly and holds to it outwardly will win in the two abodes and will be happy in both worlds.
ٱللَّهُ وَلِيُّ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ يُخْرِجُهُمْ مِّنَ ٱلظُّلُمَاتِ إِلَى ٱلنُّورِ وَٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوۤاْ أَوْلِيَآؤُهُمُ ٱلطَّاغُوتُ يُخْرِجُونَهُمْ مِّنَ ٱلنُّورِ إِلَى ٱلظُّلُمَاتِ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ أَصْحَابُ ٱلنَّارِ هُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ,God is the Protector walī of the believers; [He is] the Protector walī in the sense of the One who takes charge of their affairs mutawallī and the One who is unique in settling their concerns. The faʿīl pattern of the word walī can [also] be understood in the passive maf ʿūl399-the believers are charged yatawallawna with obeying Him. Both [usages of the word] are correct. The first [way of understanding the word walī] is a gathering and the second is a separation. Not every gathering will be limited by a separation and not every separation will be supported by a gathering. That is an error and the one who makes it is wrong. The verse bears both of the meanings. He brings them forth from the shadows into the light. This means that by His beginningless decree He protected them from the shadows which are errors and [blameworthy] innovation for they were never in the shadows in His prior knowledge. And the disbelievers-their protectors are false deities [False deities] that entice them with calls to disbelief. that bring them forth from the light into the shadows; those are the inhabitants of the fire therein they shall abide. Through the doubt that overwhelmed their hearts they denied the lordship. They are those who remain forever apart from the Real. It is said He brings them forth from the shadows of their self-direction tadbīr to the spaciousness of witnessing His determination taqdīr of events. It is said that He brings them forth from the shadows of their thinking that they have any independent means or access to Him in anything they do or do not do. It is said that He brings them forth from the shadows by lifting the shade of their lower selves from them and bringing them into the shade of His solicitude. It is said that He delivers them from paying any heed to their own salvation. It is said that He comes between them and their reliance on their actions and dependence on their states.
أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى ٱلَّذِي حَآجَّ إِبْرَاهِيمَ فِي رَبِّهِ أَنْ آتَاهُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْمُلْكَ إِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ رَبِّيَ ٱلَّذِي يُحْيِـي وَيُمِيتُ قَالَ أَنَا أُحْيِـي وَأُمِيتُ قَالَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَأْتِي بِٱلشَّمْسِ مِنَ ٱلْمَشْرِقِ فَأْتِ بِهَا مِنَ ٱلْمَغْرِبِ فَبُهِتَ ٱلَّذِي كَفَرَ وَٱللَّهُ لاَ يَهْدِي ٱلْقَوْمَ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ,Have you not seen him who disputed with Abraham concerning his Lord that God had given him the kingshipḍ When Abraham said “My Lord is He who gives life and makes to die” he said “I give life and make to die.” Abraham said: “God brings the sun from the east; so bring it from the west.” Then the disbeliever was confused; and God guides not the folk who do evil. The Real سبحانه hastened the punishment of separation furqa for His ene- mies before He punished them with burning ḥurqa. This punishment [of separation] was in actuality more powerful in its effect if they had had the eye of insight [to see this]. The Real سبحانه relates that Abraham عليه السلام moved from one sound proof with the accursed enemy to another which was clearer not because there was anything wrong with the [first] proof but because of the shortcomings in the understanding of the disbeliever. The touchstone of one whose sight is blocked from recognizing the truth is the wasting of time without any useful benefit. It is not about the quality of the proof for a matter about which there is no question.
أَوْ كَٱلَّذِي مَرَّ عَلَىٰ قَرْيَةٍ وَهِيَ خَاوِيَةٌ عَلَىٰ عُرُوشِهَا قَالَ أَنَّىٰ يُحْيِـي هَـٰذِهِ ٱللَّهُ بَعْدَ مَوْتِهَا فَأَمَاتَهُ ٱللَّهُ مِئَةَ عَامٍ ثُمَّ بَعَثَهُ قَالَ كَمْ لَبِثْتَ قَالَ لَبِثْتُ يَوْماً أَوْ بَعْضَ يَوْمٍ قَالَ بَل لَّبِثْتَ مِئَةَ عَامٍ فَٱنْظُرْ إِلَىٰ طَعَامِكَ وَشَرَابِكَ لَمْ يَتَسَنَّهْ وَٱنْظُرْ إِلَىٰ حِمَارِكَ وَلِنَجْعَلَكَ آيَةً لِلنَّاسِ وَٱنْظُرْ إِلَى ٱلعِظَامِ كَيْفَ نُنْشِزُهَا ثُمَّ نَكْسُوهَا لَحْماً فَلَمَّا تَبَيَّنَ لَهُ قَالَ أَعْلَمُ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,Or such as he who passed by a city that was all in ruins to its roofs he said “How shall God give life to this now that it is deadḍ” So God made him die for a hundred years then he raised him up; He said “How long have you tarriedḍ”; he said “I have tarried a day or part of a day”; He said “Nay you have tarried a hundred years. Look at your food and drink it has not spoiled; and look at your donkey so that We would make you a sign for the people. And look at the bones how We shall set them up and then clothe them with flesh.” So when it was made clear to him he said “I know that God has power over all things.” This was not a question of denial a matter of ignorance or an indication of doubt in divine power for this report is about Ezra ʿUzayr the prophet عليه السلام and it is not possible for the prophets [عليه السلام] to doubt or be ignorant. Rather it was a question of wondering about something extraordinary. In this conversation [Ezra] wanted to be more certain so God showed him that within his [own body] by making him die and then bringing him to life and then reviving his donkey while he watched and he became more and more certain. Asking for certainty from God and using the tactic of pos- ing difficulties are practices of those who are curious to know. Because of that God excused Ezra in this conversation and the increased certainty he sought was made possible for him. Then he said “I know that God has power over all things” in giving life and causing death that is “My knowl- edge has been increased by what I saw. He showed me weighty signs which increased my certainty.” His food and drink did not change in this long period even as his donkey died and his bones decayed.
وَإِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ رَبِّ أَرِنِي كَيْفَ تُحْيِـي ٱلْمَوْتَىٰ قَالَ أَوَلَمْ تُؤْمِن قَالَ بَلَىٰ وَلَـكِن لِّيَطْمَئِنَّ قَلْبِي قَالَ فَخُذْ أَرْبَعَةً مِّنَ ٱلطَّيْرِ فَصُرْهُنَّ إِلَيْكَ ثُمَّ ٱجْعَلْ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ جَبَلٍ مِّنْهُنَّ جُزْءًا ثُمَّ ٱدْعُهُنَّ يَأْتِينَكَ سَعْياً وَٱعْلَمْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ,And when Abraham said “My Lord show me how You give life to the dead.” He said “Why do you not believeḍ” “Yes” he said “but so that my heart may be re-assured.” Said He “Take four birds and twist them to you then set a part of them on every hill then summon them and they will come to you in haste. And know that God is Mighty Wise.” It is said that he was looking for increased certainty and wanted to compare the truth of certainty ḥaqq al-yaqīn with what he had already obtained from the eye of certainty ʿayn al-yaqīn. It is said that what [Abraham] said here was meant to elicit His words سبحانه Why do you not believeḍ [Abraham] said “Yes I believe but I longed to have You say to me 'Why do you not believeḍ' and Your saying this to me is a reassurance to my heart.” The lover is forever striving to find a way to address his beloved in any way that he can. It is said that [Abraham] was seeking a vision of the Real سبحانه by hint or allusion for he was held back by the allusion in His words “And know that God is Mighty Wise.” When Moses عليه السلام asked for the vision directly saying “My Lord! Show me that I may behold You!” [7:143] [God] replied directly and clearly and it was said to him “You shall not see Me” [7:143]. It is said that he only sought the life of his heart and this was shown to him by the sacrifice of these birds. Among the four birds there was a peacock and the allusion in its sacrifice relates to the ornament and beauty of the present world. There was also a crow because of his greed a rooster because of his [strutting] walk and a duck because of his seeking provision. When Abraham عليه السلام said “Show me how You give life to the dead” it was said to him “Will you show Me how you sacrifice lifeḍ” which meant Ishmael-one demand [was made] for another. When [Abraham] fulfilled what was asked of him the Real fulfilled what he had requested. It is said that part of the promise from the Real سبحانه was that He took [Abraham] as a friend khalīl and the sign of that was [God's] reviving the dead through his hand.
مَّثَلُ ٱلَّذِينَ يُنْفِقُونَ أَمْوَالَهُمْ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ كَمَثَلِ حَبَّةٍ أَنبَتَتْ سَبْعَ سَنَابِلَ فِي كُلِّ سُنبُلَةٍ مِّئَةُ حَبَّةٍ وَٱللَّهُ يُضَاعِفُ لِمَن يَشَآءُ وَٱللَّهُ وَاسِعٌ عَلِيمٌ,The likeness of those who expend their wealth in the way of God is as the likeness of a grain of corn that sprouts seven ears in every ear a hundred grains; so God multiplies for whom He will; God is Embracing Knowing. The compensation for [those who expend their wealth in the way of God] is the garden. The compensation of those who expend their spir- its in the way of God is the Real سبحانه. What a difference between the compensation for one who expends his wealth and finds his reward and the [compensation for] one who expends his state and finds nearness! Expending wealth in His way [happens] by [giving] alms ṣadaqa and expending [one's] states in His way [happens] through constant sincerity ṣidq413 and by negating every worldly concern or portion so that you are pleased with the flowing of His decree over you without any frowning of the heart. The one who spoke for them said: I want to be with him but he wants me to depart. So I leave want I want for what he wants. There are two types of expenditure: the expending of worshipers ʿābidūn and the expending of ecstatics wājidūn. When worshipers give grain it multiplies for them seventy times to what is beyond reckoning. As for the ecstatics it is as it is said: There is nothing good we can bring that they will accept and if we do harm for them there is no erasure.
ٱلَّذِينَ يُنْفِقُونَ أَمْوَالَهُمْ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ ثُمَّ لاَ يُتْبِعُونَ مَآ أَنْفَقُواُ مَنّاً وَلاَ أَذًى لَّهُمْ أَجْرُهُمْ عِنْدَ رَبِّهِمْ وَلاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلاَ هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ,Those who expend their wealth in the way of God then do not follow up their expenditure with a reminder of their generosity and injury their wage is with their Lord and no fear shall befall them neither shall they grieve. The reminder of generosity is proclaiming what you did. The injury is point- ing out your beneficence to the one who receives it. It is said that they expend what they expend but they most assuredly do not say anything about their actions or works. It is said “How can you give something while seeking to maintain your control416 and rights over itḍ” It is said that they do not remind others of what they have done for them but rather bear witness to the favor of God [who] grants them success in that [act of generosity].
قَوْلٌ مَّعْرُوفٌ وَمَغْفِرَةٌ خَيْرٌ مِّن صَدَقَةٍ يَتْبَعُهَآ أَذًى وَٱللَّهُ غَنِيٌّ حَلِيمٌ,Honorable words and forgiveness are better than voluntary almsgiving followed by injury; and God is Independent Forbearing. This means that words spoken to the one who is poor and deprived- responding to his overture without showing censure-are better and more perfect than the alms of one who is proud of what he does and then imposes an obligation for it. It is said that an acknowledgment from you to God of your weakness and sin and God's forgiveness for you in response to these words is better than alms adulterated with reproach and accompanied by injury.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ لاَ تُبْطِلُواْ صَدَقَٰتِكُم بِٱلْمَنِّ وَٱلأَذَىٰ كَٱلَّذِي يُنْفِقُ مَالَهُ رِئَآءَ ٱلنَّاسِ وَلاَ يُؤْمِنُ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلآخِرِ فَمَثَلُهُ كَمَثَلِ صَفْوَانٍ عَلَيْهِ تُرَابٌ فَأَصَابَهُ وَابِلٌ فَتَرَكَهُ صَلْداً لاَّ يَقْدِرُونَ عَلَىٰ شَيْءٍ مِّمَّا كَسَبُواْ وَٱللَّهُ لاَ يَهْدِي ٱلْقَوْمَ ٱلْكَافِرِينَ,O you who believe annul not your voluntary almsgivings with reproach and injury as one who expends of his substance to show off to men and believes not in God and the Last Day. The likeness of him is as the likeness of a smooth rock on which is soil and a torrent smites it and leaves it barren. They have no power over anything that they have earned. God guides not the disbelieving folk. That is the beauty of the gift comes from the Real سبحانه. There is no gift from created beings that can be attributed to anyone other than Him. Indeed gifts that come from created beings are the greatest test miḥna while witnessing the gift from God is the greatest blessing niʿma. The one who spoke for them said: There is no humility in your honoring important people. On the contrary humility is that you honor the lowly. It is said that the poorest of creatures is the one who considers himself lucky [because of his wealth and life of comfort] for his bankruptcy will become clear to him. Likewise the least of creatures in value is the one who thinks that he has something for that with which he did not reckon will appear to him from God.
وَمَثَلُ ٱلَّذِينَ يُنْفِقُونَ أَمْوٰلَهُمُ ٱبْتِغَآءَ مَرْضَاتِ ٱللَّهِ وَتَثْبِيتاً مِّنْ أَنْفُسِهِمْ كَمَثَلِ جَنَّةٍ بِرَبْوَةٍ أَصَابَهَا وَابِلٌ فَآتَتْ أُكُلَهَا ضِعْفَيْنِ فَإِن لَّمْ يُصِبْهَا وَابِلٌ فَطَلٌّ وَٱللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ  *  أَيَوَدُّ أَحَدُكُمْ أَن تَكُونَ لَهُ جَنَّةٌ مِّن نَّخِيلٍ وَأَعْنَابٍ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلأَنْهَارُ لَهُ فِيهَا مِن كُلِّ ٱلثَّمَرَاتِ وَأَصَابَهُ ٱلْكِبَرُ وَلَهُ ذُرِّيَّةٌ ضُعَفَآءُ فَأَصَابَهَآ إِعْصَارٌ فِيهِ نَارٌ فَٱحْتَرَقَتْ كَذَلِكَ يُبَيِّنُ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمُ ٱلأيَٰتِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَفَكَّرُونَ,But the likeness of those who expend their wealth seeking God's good pleasure and to confirm themselves is as the likeness of a garden upon a hill; a torrent smites it and it yields its produce twofold; if no torrent smites it then soft rain [falls upon it] and God sees what you do. Would any of you wish to have a garden of date palms and vines with rivers flowing beneath it for him there is in it all manner of fruit then old age smites him and he has seed but they are weak; then a whirlwind with fire smites it and it is consumed. So God makes clear the signs to you so that you might reflect. These are numerous signs that God mentions by way of striking similitudes for the sincere one and the hypocrite-while the one spends in the way of God the other spends his wealth in vain. While [the sincere] will obtain honor and compensation khalaf for themselves [the hypocrites] will receive only rejection in the present and nothing but ruin talaf in the end. While the effort of these remains worthy of thanks mashkūr those leave behind destruction thubūr and come to a blazing flame. The works of these thrive their wealth grows their states rise high before God and their end will be the communion [of lovers]. The works of those will come to nothing. Their states will be of loss their hopes sealed by misfortune and their curse doubled for them. It is said that the similitude of these is like the one who planted seed; his property thrived and his surplus grew. His branches grew high and his benefit multiplied. The similitude of those is like the one whose bargaining failed; his commodity [was] stolen and his stratagem came to naught in old age. His tribulations continued one after the other in every way and in every time. How can these two be equal as examplesḍ Do they have any resemblance to one anotherḍ

يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُوۤاْ أَنْفِقُواْ مِن طَيِّبَاتِ مَا كَسَبْتُمْ وَمِمَّآ أَخْرَجْنَا لَكُم مِّنَ ٱلأَرْضِ وَلاَ تَيَمَّمُواْ ٱلْخَبِيثَ مِنْهُ تُنْفِقُونَ وَلَسْتُمْ بِآخِذِيهِ إِلاَّ أَن تُغْمِضُواْ فِيهِ وَٱعْلَمُوۤاْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَنِيٌّ حَمِيدٌ,O you who believe expend of the good things you have earned and of what We have produced for you from the earth and seek not the corrupt of it for your expending; for you would never take it yourselves without closing your eyes to it; and know that God is Independent Laudable. Let everyone consider what he expends on his own account and what is produced by the command of his Lord. That which is brought out against you is from your account book dīwān: That which has been designated for your worldly portion are the precious things you possess and that which has been designated for your Lord are the things of little value from your assets. That which is [given by you] for God's sake is but a morsel while that which is [given by God] for your sake is of the utmost value and [is] the most perfect in blessing. Then see how He forgives you and even accepts it from you. Nay look how He compensates you. Nay look how He praises you for it look how he ascribes it to you. Everything from Him is a favor but He ascribes it to you as an act. Therefore His gift is entrusted to you and the gift is called a reward. He expands you by giving you success from [His] kindness. Then [your expansion] spreads out into the world by [His] beneficence.
ٱلشَّيْطَانُ يَعِدُكُمُ ٱلْفَقْرَ وَيَأْمُرُكُم بِٱلْفَحْشَآءِ وَٱللَّهُ يَعِدُكُم مَّغْفِرَةً مِّنْهُ وَفَضْلاً وَٱللَّهُ وَاسِعٌ عَلِيمٌ,Satan promises you poverty and enjoins you to indecency but God promises you His pardon and His bounty; and God is Embracing Knowing. Satan promises poverty because of his poverty. God promises forgiveness because of His generosity. Satan promises you poverty and counsels you to hold on to what is known. It is said that [Satan] counsels you [to yield] and in yielding to him [you yield] to greed and there is no poverty worse than this. He promises you poverty by handing you over to your [own] direction tadbīr and your [own] preferences ikhtiyār. He promises you poverty to forget what you have become accustomed to from [God's] bounty. It is said that he promises you poverty in that he does not let your complaints cease. It is said that he promises you poverty by attaching your heart to what it does not need. It is said that [he promises you poverty] by deceiving you from seeing that [God] suffices. He enjoins you to indecency that is desire for the present world. It is said that [He enjoins you to indecency] through the bonds that strengthen greed. It is said that [He enjoins you to indecency] by multiplying [your] expec- tations and [urging you to] abandon contentment. It is said that [He enjoins you to indecency] by [urging you to] follow carnal desires and prefer worldly fortunes. It is said that [He enjoins you to indecency] by [urging you to] look to something other than Him and allow anything to enter [your] mind except Him. It is said that [He enjoins you to indecency] by going backward to the familiar territories of permissiveness and interpretive license after the truth has been made clear. It is said that [He enjoins you to indecency] by returning [you] to what you had renounced for God. But God promises you His pardon and His bounty: The bounty prom- ised in the here and now is contentment. In the future it is the reward the garden the vision the good pleasure pardon and forgiveness. It is said that it is victory in the here and now over the lower self. It is said that it is the opening of the door of deeper knowledge the spreading of the carpet of forgiveness and receiving the unveilings of intimacy.
يُؤْتِي الْحِكْمَةَ مَن يَشَآءُ وَمَن يُؤْتَ الْحِكْمَةَ فَقَدْ أُوتِيَ خَيْراً كَثِيراً وَمَا يَذَّكَّرُ إِلاَّ أُوْلُواْ ٱلأَلْبَابِ,He gives wisdom to whomever He will and he who is given wisdom has been given much good; yet none remembers but the people of pith. Wisdom ḥikma is the thought khāṬir of the Real ruling yaḥkum you not the caller of the lower self. The overpowering forces qawāhir of the Real rule you not the drivers zawājir of Satan. It is said that wisdom is rightness in affairs ṣawāb al-ʿumūr. It is said that [wisdom] is [not allowing] the frivolities of human nature to rule you. One who has no control ḥukm over his lower self has no control over anyone else. It is said that wisdom is being in conformity muwāfaqa with the command of God most high and foolishness is opposing mukhālafa His command. It is said that wisdom is bearing witness to the Real and foolishness is bearing witness to anything other than Him.
وَمَآ أَنفَقْتُمْ مِّن نَّفَقَةٍ أَوْ نَذَرْتُمْ مِّن نَّذْرٍ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَعْلَمُهُ وَمَا لِلظَّالِمِينَ مِنْ أَنْصَارٍ,And whatever expenditure you expend and whatever vow you make surely God knows it. For the evildoers they have no helpers. He has promised His punishment to some people His reward to others and His knowledge to others. [Those promised punishment or reward] are ordinary people and [those promised knowledge] are the elect. God most high said “And submit patiently to the judgment of your Lord for surely you fare before Our eyes” [52:48]. There is nothing that causes the servant to fall from the eyes of God like opposing the covenants with Him in the heart. So let the aspirant be very wary of letting his soul err in that.
إِن تُبْدُواْ ٱلصَّدَقَاتِ فَنِعِمَّا هِيَ وَإِن تُخْفُوهَا وَتُؤْتُوهَا ٱلْفُقَرَآءَ فَهُوَ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ وَيُكَفِّرُ عَنكُم مِّن سَيِّئَاتِكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيرٌ,If you proclaim your voluntary almsgivings it is a fine thing; but if you conceal them and give them to the poor that is even better for you; and it will absolve you of your evil deeds. God is aware of what you do. “If you reveal your companionship ṣuḥba with Us and make it public you have behaved generously and well. But if you protect Our secret from the intrusion of intermediaries between us you have kept the conditions of love widād and have raised up the lofty edifice of communion wuṣla.”
لَّيْسَ عَلَيْكَ هُدَاهُمْ وَلَـٰكِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَهْدِي مَن يَشَآءُ وَمَا تُنْفِقُواْ مِنْ خَيْرٍ فَلأَنْفُسِكُمْ وَمَا تُنْفِقُونَ إِلاَّ ٱبْتِغَآءَ وَجْهِ ٱللَّهِ وَمَا تُنْفِقُواْ مِنْ خَيْرٍ يُوَفَّ إِلَيْكُمْ وَأَنْتُمْ لاَ تُظْلَمُونَ,You are not responsible for guiding them; but God guides whomever He will. And whatever good you expend is for yourselves; for then you are expending desiring only God's face and whatever good you expend shall be repaid to you in full and you will not be wronged. “[O Muḥammad] yours is the praiseworthy station al-maqām al-maḥmūd the firmly tied banner al-liwāÌ al-maʿqūd the noble degrees al-rutab al-sharīfa the high waystations al-manāzil al-ʿaliyya and the pleasing practices al-sunan al-marḌiyya. You are the leader of those who come first and those who come last. No one comes close to you and certainly [no one] equals you. But you are not responsible for their guidance. Guidance is among the special characteristics of Our right and not a sliver of it is given to another. O Muḥammad you call them but We guide them.”
لِلْفُقَرَآءِ ٱلَّذِينَ أُحصِرُواْ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ لاَ يَسْتَطِيعُونَ ضَرْباً فِي ٱلأَرْضِ يَحْسَبُهُمُ ٱلْجَاهِلُ أَغْنِيَآءَ مِنَ ٱلتَّعَفُّفِ تَعْرِفُهُم بِسِيمَاهُمْ لاَ يَسْأَلُونَ ٱلنَّاسَ إِلْحَافاً وَمَا تُنفِقُواْ مِنْ خَيْرٍ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ بِهِ عَلِيمٌ,For the poor fuqarāÌ who are constrained in the way of God; and are unable to journey in the land; the ignorant man supposes them rich because of their abstinence; but you shall know them by their mark; they do not beg of men importunately. And whatever good you expend surely God has knowledge of it. The authority of reality sulṬān al-ḥaqīqa has obstructed every way for them; there is no way for them to travel to the east and no place to camp to the west. Whichever way they look they see the large tents of God's unity tawḥīd surrounding them: It is as if the wide road of the earth with all its vastness became narrow for me but it neither increased in length nor width. They do not take a single breath with what is created. How could they when nothing [truly] exists [except God]ḍ Thus any affirmation [of what does not truly exist] is a way of ascribing partners to the One God. The sincere poor man faqīr stands with God through God. Outsiders cannot behold him and created beings have no way to him. [God] makes [the poor fuqarāÌ] appear in the eyes of others in clothes like theirs. God most high said “the ignorant man supposes them rich because of their abstinence.” But for those who possess insight there is no ambiguity in anything in their states. “You shall know them O Muḥammad by their mark.” This mark is not one that appears to the physical eye but is a mark that the inner sight perceives. There is no beholding them except by the light of oneness. It is said that you will know them by their mark [which is] the rejoic- ing of their hearts at the breaking of their lower selves and the crying out of their innermost selves to the throne as their outward aspect withers beyond recovery. It is said that the brokenness of the outward form comes with the bro- kenness of the inward-indeed [with these poor] they do not beg of men importunately. If they do beg from created beings without being importune as the [QurÌānic] address suggests that is a protection for them and for the secret of their story because creatures will not view them as begging. In their innermost selves there is not a speck of affirmation for anything other [than God]. It is said [regarding those] who are constrained in the way of God that they hold to the decree of God and constrain their lower selves in obedi- ence to Him aḥṣarū nufūsahum ʿalā Ṭāʿatihi their hearts in knowing Him wa-qulūbahum ʿalā maʿrifatihi their spirits in loving Him wa-arwāḥahum ʿalā maḥabbatihi and their innermost selves in seeing Him wa-asrārahum ʿalā ruÌyatihi.
ٱلَّذِينَ يُنْفِقُونَ أَمْوَالَهُمْ بِٱللَّيْلِ وَٱلنَّهَارِ سِرّاً وَعَلاَنِيَةً فَلَهُمْ أَجْرُهُمْ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ وَلاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلاَ هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ,Those who expend their wealth night and day secretly and openly their wage awaits them with their Lord and no fear shall befall them neither shall they grieve. As long as they have wealth they do not become listless for even an hour in expending it night and day. When the wealth is depleted they do not become listless in bearing witness to Him at every moment night and day.
ٱلَّذِينَ يَأْكُلُونَ ٱلرِّبَٰواْ لاَ يَقُومُونَ إِلاَّ كَمَا يَقُومُ ٱلَّذِي يَتَخَبَّطُهُ ٱلشَّيْطَانُ مِنَ ٱلْمَسِّ ذَلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ قَالُوۤاْ إِنَّمَا ٱلْبَيْعُ مِثْلُ ٱلرِّبَٰواْ وَأَحَلَّ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْبَيْعَ وَحَرَّمَ ٱلرِّبَٰواْ فَمَن جَآءَهُ مَوْعِظَةٌ مِّنْ رَّبِّهِ فَٱنْتَهَىٰ فَلَهُ مَا سَلَفَ وَأَمْرُهُ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ وَمَنْ عَادَ فَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ أَصْحَابُ ٱلنَّارِ هُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ,Those who devour usury shall not rise again except as one whom Satan has made prostrate from touch; that is because they say “Trade is like usury”: God has permitted trade and forbidden usury. Whoever receives an admonition from his Lord and desists he shall have his past gains and his affair is committed to God; but whoever reverts-those are the inhabitants of the fire abiding therein. Those who turn away from the command giving themselves license from their own interpretation taÌwīl have neither secure independence in the present moment lā istiqlālun lahum fī l-ḥāl nor recovery in the end wa- lā intiʿāshun fī l-maÌāl. They lose in their current life khasirū fī ʿājilihim and have no profit in their future wa-lam yarbaḥū fī ājilihim. Those who heed the calls of admonition curb the bridle of their whims and do not give free rein to persist [in prohibited actions] are granted respite for the present. However if they return to these blameworthy states let them wait for the swiftest uprooting and sudden chastisement.
يَمْحَقُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلرِّبَٰواْ وَيُرْبِي ٱلصَّدَقَٰتِ وَٱللَّهُ لاَ يُحِبُّ كُلَّ كَفَّارٍ أَثِيمٍ,God effaces usury but He augments voluntary almsgivings with inter- est. God loves not any guilty ingrate. The behaviors He has permitted are connected to good things fa-maqrūnun bi-l-khayrāt and are accompanied by blessings wa-maṣḥūbun bi-l-barakāt while [behaviors] that arise from [personal] whims come to naught-loss is the end of the affair of one [who follows his own whims].
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ وَأَقَامُواْ ٱلصَّلَٰوةَ وَآتَوُاْ ٱلزَّكَٰوةَ لَهُمْ أَجْرُهُمْ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ وَلاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلاَ هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ,Those who believe and perform righteous deeds and establish the prayer and pay the alms-their wage awaits them with their Lord and no fear shall befall them neither shall they grieve. That is “verily for those who have found what is from Us sufficient-indeed We do not leave the reward of those of good deeds to go to waste” [18:30]
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ ٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَذَرُواْ مَا بَقِيَ مِنَ ٱلرِّبَٰواْ إِن كُنْتُمْ مُّؤْمِنِينَ,O you who believe fear God and give up the usury that is outstand- ing if you are believers. Being content with what is promised mawʿūd by the Lord is better for the one who submits than attaching one's heart to what the lower self seeks maqṣūd. What you seek maqṣūd is from the deceptions of the lower self while what you are promised mawʿūd is guaranteed by the Real.
فَإِن لَّمْ تَفْعَلُواْ فَأْذَنُواْ بِحَرْبٍ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ وَإِنْ تُبْتُمْ فَلَكُمْ رُؤُوسُ أَمْوَٰلِكُمْ لاَ تَظْلِمُونَ وَلاَ تُظْلَمُونَ,But if you do not then be warned of war from God and His Messenger. Yet if you repent you shall have your principal sums not being unjust and no injustice being done to you. Those who willfully persist have no weight or measure miqdār before Us no standing or degree of dignity akhṬār.
وَإِن كَانَ ذُو عُسْرَةٍ فَنَظِرَةٌ إِلَىٰ مَيْسَرَةٍ وَأَن تَصَدَّقُواْ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ إِن كُنْتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ,And if any man should be in difficulty then [let there be] respite till things are easier; but that you should give a voluntary almsgiving is better for you did you but know. When the insolvency of a detained man is determined before the judge it is not permissible to continue his detention. If the proof of the man's insolvency is demonstrated that [proof] is taken in security for what is due his adversary. But he is in a period of respite and delay. In that the Lord does not judge us but with His knowledge of our difficulties and weakness and the sincerity of our need for Him and our dedication to Him He is merciful with us. His words “till things are easier” [relate to] the poor insolvent man [who] has no way to obtain anything for himself except through what God سبحانه appoints for him as the portion of debtors. Income accrues to those who have the goods and the contract. What does the insolvent [per- son] have to do with itḍ What does the insolvent [person] have to do with profit in trade from the transformation of capital and what is done with itḍ What is left for the insolvent [person]ḍ The jurists say he must seek work if he is healthy. If he is weak then this [statement that he must seek work] applies only if he has enough physical strength. As for those who are bankrupt in vigor just as one is bankrupt in wealth what way remains for him except what his Protector appoints for himḍ
وَٱتَّقُواْ يَوْماً تُرْجَعُونَ فِيهِ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ ثُمَّ تُوَفَّىٰ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ مَّا كَسَبَتْ وَهُمْ لاَ يُظْلَمُونَ,And fear a day wherein you shall be returned to God and every soul shall be paid in full what it has earned; and they shall not be wronged. There are two kinds of return: [a return] for the bodily and lower selves in the future at the time of death and [a return] for the innermost selves and hearts at every breath. [The latter is] a reckoning-a payment in ready cash versus a promise [regarding the future]. The payment in ready cash for His claim [at every breath] is more fitting than what will come at the resurrection by His promise. He said to ordinary people “And fear a day” and He said to the elect “and fear Me” [2:41].
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُوۤاْ إِذَا تَدَايَنتُم بِدَيْنٍ إِلَىٰ أَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّى فَٱكْتُبُوهُ وَلْيَكْتُب بَّيْنَكُمْ كَاتِبٌ بِٱلْعَدْلِ وَلاَ يَأْبَ كَاتِبٌ أَنْ يَكْتُبَ كَمَا عَلَّمَهُ ٱللَّهُ فَلْيَكْتُبْ وَلْيُمْلِلِ ٱلَّذِي عَلَيْهِ ٱلْحَقُّ وَلْيَتَّقِ ٱللَّهَ رَبَّهُ وَلاَ يَبْخَسْ مِنْهُ شَيْئاً فَإن كَانَ ٱلَّذِي عَلَيْهِ ٱلْحَقُّ سَفِيهاً أَوْ ضَعِيفاً أَوْ لاَ يَسْتَطِيعُ أَن يُمِلَّ هُوَ فَلْيُمْلِلْ وَلِيُّهُ بِٱلْعَدْلِ وَٱسْتَشْهِدُواْ شَهِيدَيْنِ مِّن رِّجَالِكُمْ فَإِن لَّمْ يَكُونَا رَجُلَيْنِ فَرَجُلٌ وَٱمْرَأَتَانِ مِمَّن تَرْضَوْنَ مِنَ ٱلشُّهَدَآءِ أَن تَضِلَّ إِحْدَاهُمَا فَتُذَكِّرَ إِحْدَاهُمَا ٱلأُخْرَىٰ وَلاَ يَأْبَ ٱلشُّهَدَآءُ إِذَا مَا دُعُواْ وَلاَ تَسْأَمُوۤاْ أَن تَكْتُبُوهُ صَغِيراً أَو كَبِيراً إِلَىٰ أَجَلِهِ ذَلِكُمْ أَقْسَطُ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ وَأَقْومُ لِلشَّهَٰدَةِ وَأَدْنَىٰ أَلاَّ تَرْتَابُوۤاْ إِلاَّ أَن تَكُونَ تِجَٰرَةً حَاضِرَةً تُدِيرُونَهَا بَيْنَكُمْ فَلَيْسَ عَلَيْكُمْ جُنَاحٌ أَلاَّ تَكْتُبُوهَا وَأَشْهِدُوۤاْ إِذَا تَبَايَعْتُمْ وَلاَ يُضَآرَّ كَاتِبٌ وَلاَ شَهِيدٌ وَإِن تَفْعَلُواْ فَإِنَّهُ فُسُوقٌ بِكُمْ وَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَيُعَلِّمُكُمُ ٱللَّهُ وَٱللَّهُ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عَلِيمٌ  *  وَإِن كُنتُمْ عَلَىٰ سَفَرٍ وَلَمْ تَجِدُواْ كَاتِباً فَرِهَٰنٌ مَّقْبُوضَةٌ فَإِنْ أَمِنَ بَعْضُكُم بَعْضاً فَلْيُؤَدِّ ٱلَّذِي ٱؤْتُمِنَ أَمَانَتَهُ وَلْيَتَّقِ ٱللَّهَ رَبَّهُ وَلاَ تَكْتُمُواْ ٱلشَّهَٰدَةَ وَمَن يَكْتُمْهَا فَإِنَّهُ آثِمٌ قَلْبُهُ وَٱللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ عَلِيمٌ,O you who believe when you contract a debt one upon another for a stated term write it down; and let a writer write it down between you justly; and let not any writer refuse to write it down as God has taught him; so let him write and let the debtor dictate; and let him fear God his Lord and not diminish anything of it. And if the debtor be a fool or weak or unable to dictate himself then let his guardian dictate justly. And summon to bear witness two witnesses men; or if the two be not men then one man and two women such witnesses as you approve of so that if one of the two women errs; the other will remind her; and let the witnesses not refuse whenever they are summoned; and be not disdainful to write it down small or great with its term; that is more equitable in God's sight more upright for testimony and nearer that you will not be in doubt unless it be trade carried out there and then that you give and take between you then you will not be at fault if you do not write it down. And take witnesses when you are trading with one another. And let not either writer or witness be pressed; and if you do that is sinfulness in you. And fear God. God teaches you and God knows all things. And if you are upon a journey and you do not find a writer then a pledge in hand. But if one of you trusts another let him who is trusted deliver his trust and let him fear God his Lord. And do not conceal the testimony; whoever conceals it his heart is sinful; and God knows what you do. God سبحانه commands created beings to act with sincerity ṣidq. He teaches them the particulars of their transactions with one another and teaches them to adopt caution and bear witness [as explained in this verse] so that no injury will occur between them. That is in accordance with His mercy toward them and follows from His kindness to them so that they will not be adversaries. He commands that rights be strengthened by writing and tak- ing witnesses and commands [this] witnessing from the outset and through the execution [of the transaction].

للَّهِ ما فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوٰتِ وَمَا فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَإِن تُبْدُواْ مَا فِيۤ أَنْفُسِكُمْ أَوْ تُخْفُوهُ يُحَاسِبْكُمْ بِهِ ٱللَّهُ فَيَغْفِرُ لِمَن يَشَآءُ وَيُعَذِّبُ مَن يَشَآءُ وَٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,To God belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth. Whether you disclose what is in your hearts or hide it God shall take you to account yuḥāsibkum for it. Then He will forgive whom He wishes and chastise whom He wishes. And God has power over all things. [That is] whether you disclose what is in your hearts in deep intuitions maʿānī or pretensions daʿāwā. It is said that whether you disclose what is in your hearts [refers to] intentions and wishes al-quṣūd wa-l-raghāÌib and various needs and requests funūn al-ḥawāÌiḥ wa-l-maṬālib. It is said that what you disclose is worship ʿibāda and what you hide is desire irāda. It is said that what you hide are thoughts khaṬarāt and what you dis- close are your states of rest and movement sakanāt wa-l-ḥarakāt. It is said that the allusion is to perpetual observation istidāmat al-murāqaba and holding fast to the accounting muḥāsaba436 so that you will not be heedless for a moment not even for a breath.
ءَامَنَ ٱلرَّسُولُ بِمَآ أُنْزِلَ إِلَيْهِ مِن رَّبِّهِ وَٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ كُلٌّ آمَنَ بِٱللَّهِ وَمَلاۤئِكَتِهِ وَكُتُبِهِ وَرُسُلِهِ لاَ نُفَرِّقُ بَيْنَ أَحَدٍ مِّن رُّسُلِهِ وَقَالُواْ سَمِعْنَا وَأَطَعْنَا غُفْرَانَكَ رَبَّنَا وَإِلَيْكَ ٱلْمَصِيرُ,The Messenger believes in what was revealed to him from his Lord and the believers; each one believes in God and His angels and in His Books and His messengers “we make no distinction between any of His messengers.” And they say “We hear and obey; Your forgiveness our Lord; to You is the homecoming.” This is the testimony of faith shahāda of the Real سبحانه on behalf of His Prophet ﷺ and that is more perfect for him than his speaking for himself. It is said that all created beings believe through demonstrative proof burhān while the Messenger عليه السلام believes through eyewitnessing ʿiyān. It is said that created beings believe through intermediaries while Muḥammad ﷺ believes without any intermediary. It is said that this was the address of the Real with him on the night of the ascension miʿrāj and indicates respect for [his] rank: He said “The Messenger believes” not “You [Muḥammad] believe” just as one says to an important person “the Shaykh said...” rather than “you said....” It is said that both the Messenger and the believers believe in God His angels His books and His messengers but what a difference between one faith and another! All [believers] believe by being shown the way but you O Muḥammad believe through arrival.
لاَ يُكَلِّفُ ٱللَّهُ نَفْساً إِلاَّ وُسْعَهَا لَهَا مَا كَسَبَتْ وَعَلَيْهَا مَا ٱكْتَسَبَتْ رَبَّنَا لاَ تُؤَاخِذْنَا إِن نَّسِينَآ أَوْ أَخْطَأْنَا رَبَّنَا وَلاَ تَحْمِلْ عَلَيْنَآ إِصْراً كَمَا حَمَلْتَهُ عَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِنَا رَبَّنَا وَلاَ تُحَمِّلْنَا مَا لاَ طَاقَةَ لَنَا بِهِ وَٱعْفُ عَنَّا وَٱغْفِرْ لَنَا وَٱرْحَمْنَآ أَنتَ مَوْلَٰـنَا فَٱنْصُرْنَا عَلَى ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلْكَافِرِينَ,God charges no soul save to its capacity; Because of the perfection of His mercy to [human beings] He takes them to the limit of their capacity and indeed far less than that. All of that is compassion and favor from Him. for it is what it is has merited in good deeds and against it is what it has earned. [That is] what it acquires in repentance saves the one who acquires it. Our Lord take us not to task if we forget or err; our Lord burden us not with a load such as You did lay upon those before us. Our Lord do not burden us beyond what we have the power to bear; When a need arose [the community of Moses] spoke through an inter- mediary saying “O Moses... pray to your lord for us” [2:61]. But [God] said to the community [of Muḥammad] “Call on Me and I will respond to you” [40:60]. When earlier communities sinned time passed before their repentance was accepted while the Prophet ﷺ said about this community [of Muslims] “Remorse is repentance.”Among the earlier communities there were those who said “make for us a god just as they have gods” [7:138] while this community was selected through the illumination of the lights of their declaration of oneness. Their qualities are beyond explanation. and pardon us in the present fī l-ḥāl. and forgive us in the end fī l-maÌāl and have mercy on us; You are our Patron; so grant us assistance against the disbelieving folk. [That is] “in all circumstances for we have no one other than You. You are our Patron so give us assistance against anything that distracts us from You.” When they said “burden us not with a load such as You did lay upon those before us”: God caused their sins to disappear in contrast to those who came before whose disappearance He caused. He transformed their sins into good deeds in contrast to the metamorphosis maskh [of an earlier community] and He rained mercy down on them in contrast to the stones He rained down on those who came before. Praise be to God Lord of the worlds.
الۤمۤ,Alif Lām Mīm His saying “Alif” alludes to His being sufficient for you in all of your states. You are captive to heedlessness and have not found the way to right action and thinking. He is the One who sets in motion what restores you and is solely sufficient for you in what helps you. Without your asking-and even without you knowing your own state-He suffices for you even if you do not perceive it. He gives to you without your seeking. The Lām alludes to His kindness luṬf to you at the most subtle and hidden level so much so that the locus of favor by which He strengthens you is not apparent to you. The Mīm alludes to the harmony muwāfaqa of the stream of the [divine] determination of events taqdīr with the circumstances requested by the friends. Nothing in the world moves no particle appears unless it is an occasion of good pleasure with respect to them. It would not be going too far to say that in His words “Every day He is upon some matter” [55:29] the “matter” is an actualization of what the friends desire. It is said that by listening to these disconnected letters [Alif Lām Mīm] which are contrary to the ordinary customs of human discourse every concept disappears from the hearts whether it be a known written cus- tomary or imagined thing and whether it arises from necessity Ḍarūra sensory perception ḥiss or independent reasoning ijtihād. When the hearts are emptied of imagined and known concepts and the innermost selves are purified of customary and familiar things the name Allāh comes to a heart sanctified from everything other [than Him] and to an innermost self purified of every mode [of inquiry] kayf.
ٱللَّهُ لاۤ إِلَـٰهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ ٱلْحَيُّ ٱلْقَيُّومُ,God! There is no god except Him the Living the Eternal. He is the One who is not diverted so as to be too busy for you nor is He inattentive so that you are left without Him. He is the attentive observer raqībover all of the states of your innermost self. If you are alone He is watchful over you. If you are in the midst of human beings He is watch- ful over you. In sum however your states circle around you He is your Beloved ḥabīb.
نَزَّلَ عَلَيْكَ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ بِٱلْحَقِّ مُصَدِّقاً لِّمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ وَأَنزَلَ ٱلتَّوْرَاةَ وَٱلإِنْجِيلَ  *  مِن قَبْلُ هُدًى لِّلنَّاسِ وَأَنزَلَ ٱلْفُرْقَانَ إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ بِآيَاتِ ٱللَّهِ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ شَدِيدٌ وَٱللَّهُ عَزِيزٌ ذُو ٱنْتِقَامٍ,He has revealed to you the Book by the truth “You did not know O Muḥammad what the Book was nor the story of the lovers. But a matter of pre-eternal choosing came suddenly upon you and cast you into an amazing affair its proof sublime its place of descent and occurrence precious.” confirming what was before it that is verifying His promise to you in the books that came through the prophets [عليه السلام]. and He revealed the Torah and the Gospel before as guidance to people and He revealed the criterion. That is to say “Even though We revealed Our books to the messengers before you We did not omit the remembrance dhikr of you from any book.” The one who spoke for them said: With me from our absent beloveds are pages. The remembrance of you is their title page. “Just as We have extended the lights of the prophets through you We have adorned all that We have revealed in remembrances with your remembrance.” As for those who disbelieve in God's signs for them awaits a terrible chastisement. [The chastisement] is the ignominy of the veil but they do not perceive [this]. God is Precious ʿazīz to His friends Lord of Retribution to His enemies. Everyone seeks what is precious but most do not find it.

إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لاَ يَخْفَىٰ عَلَيْهِ شَيْءٌ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَلاَ فِي ٱلسَّمَآءِ,Nothing whatever is hidden in heaven and earth from God. A servant does not breathe a single breath without God سبحانه وتعالى counting it muḥṣīhi. Not a particle exists in the heaven and earth unless He is its originator and creator mubdiʿ hi. No one has any quality or attribute except He is its governor mutawallīhi. This is the view of ordinary people ʿumūm. As for the elect khuṣūṣ no one presents a need to Him except He satisfies it qāḌīhā and no one has any resource in a calamity except He suffices for it kāfīhā.
هُوَ ٱلَّذِي يُصَوِّرُكُمْ فِي ٱلأَرْحَامِ كَيْفَ يَشَآءُ لاَ إِلَـٰهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ,He it is who forms you in the wombs as He will. [What has been formed] remains as it was created. It is He who determined your states in eternity as He willed-this remains as it was and is from the divine decree and destiny. There is no god except Him the Mighty al-ʿazīz the Wise al-ḥakīm. His decision is not followed by any reversal fa-lā yuʿaqqabu ḥukmuhu11 bi-l-naqḌ nor can His ordaining be avoided by neglect or rejection aw yuʿāraḌu taqdīruhu bi-l-ihmāli wa-l-rafḌ.
هُوَ ٱلَّذِيۤ أَنزَلَ عَلَيْكَ ٱلْكِتَابَ مِنْهُ آيَاتٌ مُّحْكَمَاتٌ هُنَّ أُمُّ ٱلْكِتَابِ وَأُخَرُ مُتَشَابِهَاتٌ فَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ في قُلُوبِهِمْ زَيْغٌ فَيَتَّبِعُونَ مَا تَشَابَهَ مِنْهُ ٱبْتِغَاءَ ٱلْفِتْنَةِ وَٱبْتِغَاءَ تَأْوِيلِهِ وَمَا يَعْلَمُ تَأْوِيلَهُ إِلاَّ ٱللَّهُ وَٱلرَّاسِخُونَ فِي ٱلْعِلْمِ يَقُولُونَ آمَنَّا بِهِ كُلٌّ مِّنْ عِندِ رَبِّنَا وَمَا يَذَّكَّرُ إِلاَّ أُوْلُواْ ٱلأَلْبَابِ,He it is who revealed to you the Book wherein are verses [that are] clear forming the Mother Book and others [that are] allegorical. As for those in whose hearts is deviation they follow the allegorical part desiring sedition and desiring its interpretation and none knows its interpretation save God. And those firmly rooted in knowledge al-rāsikhūn fī l-ʿilm say “We believe in it; all is from our Lord”; yet none remembers but people of pith. He classified the [divine] speech for them: In its exoteric sense its revela- tion is clear fa-min ẓāhirin wāḌiḥu tanzīlihi and in its obscure sense its interpretation is difficult wa-min ghāmiḌin mushkilu taÌwīlihi. The first portion is for explaining the law and to guide the people of the exoteric sense. The second portion is to protect the disclosure of secrets from the view of outsiders. The way of the scholars ʿulamāÌ is firmly rooted rusūkh in seeking its meaning in conformity with the basic foundations uṣūl [of the religion] and what is attained by [this type of] inquiry is accepted. They leave that which cannot be known by mental examination fikr to the world of the unseen. The way of the people of allusion ishāra and understanding fahm is to listen with the presence of the heart ḥuḌūr al-qalb. The glimmers of information that come to their understanding are based on the allusions of unveiling ishārāt al-kashf. If they have been asked to maintain the veil and conceal the secret they feign dumbness. If they have been commanded to reveal and disseminate they give voice to the explanation of the Real and speak of the information of the unseen. Those who have been sup- ported by the lights of insights are illuminated by the rays of the suns of understanding. Those who are clothed in the covering of doubt have been denied the subtleties of realization. Their states are fractured conjectures assail them and they are swept away in torrents of doubt and deception. Their ignorance only increases their denial and their estrangement only increases their uncertainty. And none knows its interpretation save God: The faith of those who find their knowledge from God will not suffer from meandering thoughts that permit [questionable interpretation]. Rather [their faith will be based] upon clear statements of plain meaning and sincere articulations of cer- tainty. Those with clear intellects aṣḥāb al-ʿuqūl al-ṣāḥiyya are among those who remember ṣuḥbat al-tadhakkur because of the appearance of demonstrative proofs and the careful examination of the principles of obtaining [knowledge].
رَبَّنَا لاَ تُزِغْ قُلُوبَنَا بَعْدَ إِذْ هَدَيْتَنَا وَهَبْ لَنَا مِن لَّدُنْكَ رَحْمَةً إِنَّكَ أَنْتَ ٱلْوَهَّابُ,Our Lord do not cause our hearts to deviate after You have guided us; and give us mercy from You; You are the Bestower. They do not increase in nearness unless they increase in refined behavior adab. To take refuge in maintaining distance is the most powerful means for respecting proper behavior adab. It is said that when they sincerely call for help in a beautiful manner they are assisted by the lights of [divine] sufficiency.
رَبَّنَآ إِنَّكَ جَامِعُ ٱلنَّاسِ لِيَوْمٍ لاَّ رَيْبَ فِيهِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لاَ يُخْلِفُ ٱلْمِيعَادَ,Our Lord You shall gather mankind for a day of which there is no doubt; verily God will not fail the tryst. Today is the gathering of the lovers on the carpet of approach iqtirāb and tomorrow will be the gathering of all in the place of reward thawāb and punishment ʿiqāb. Today is the gathering of innermost selves asrār for the unveiling of [divine] Majesty jalāl and Beauty jamāl and tomor- row will be the gathering of human beings abshār to witness the terrors ahwāl and endure what has been told of these states aḥwāl.
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لَن تُغْنِيَ عَنْهُمْ أَمْوَالُهُمْ وَلاَ أَوْلاَدُهُم مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ شَيْئاً وَأُولَـٰئِكَ هُمْ وَقُودُ ٱلنَّارِ,As for the disbelievers neither their riches nor their children will avail them against God; those-they shall be fuel for the fire. No ransom will benefit them fa-lā fidāÌ yanfaʿuhum no riches defend them wa-lā ghanāÌ yadfaʿuhum. No wealth will be accepted from them no veil will be raised from them no statements heard regarding them. With them will blaze hellfire al-jaḥīm and for them is a painful banishment al-Ṭard al-alīm and distance [from God] and boiling water wa-l-buʿd wa-l-ḥamīm.
كَدَأْبِ آلِ فِرْعَوْنَ وَٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ كَذَّبُواْ بِآيَاتِنَا فَأَخَذَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ بِذُنُوبِهِمْ وَٱللَّهُ شَدِيدُ ٱلْعِقَابِ,As the way of Pharoah's folk and the people before them who denied Our signs; God seized them for their sins; God is severe in retribution. “They persisted in insolence according to their way sunna and We brought them retribution according to Our way sunna.” They would not stop their persistent [insolence] fa-lā ʿan al-iṣrār aqlaʿū and did not strive to do anything good wa-lā fī l-mabārri Ṭamiʿū. By my life they are those who suffered regret and distress at what they put forward but by that time they found the door blocked wajadū l-bāba masdūdan and their repentance rejected wa-l-nadama ʿalayhim mardūdan.
قُلْ لِّلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ سَتُغْلَبُونَ وَتُحْشَرُونَ إِلَىٰ جَهَنَّمَ وَبِئْسَ ٱلْمِهَادُ,Say to the disbelievers: “You shall be vanquished and mustered to hell- an evil resting place! He informed them that the speech of the Real will elude them in the future ājil and they will have no delight in living in the present #703;ājil. In the hereafter what they will encounter will be from the severity of the punishment by burning ḥurqa. What [already] afflicts them in this world is absence and separation furqa from God but their faculties of insight have become weak and they do not perceive the pain of [that] punishment.
قَدْ كَانَ لَكُمْ آيَةٌ فِي فِئَتَيْنِ ٱلْتَقَتَا فِئَةٌ تُقَاتِلُ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ وَأُخْرَىٰ كَافِرَةٌ يَرَوْنَهُمْ مِّثْلَيْهِمْ رَأْيَ ٱلْعَيْنِ وَٱللَّهُ يُؤَيِّدُ بِنَصْرِهِ مَن يَشَآءُ إِنَّ فِي ذٰلِكَ لَعِبْرَةً لأُوْلِي ٱلأَبْصَارِ,There has already been a sign for you in two hosts that met; one com- pany fighting in the way of God; and another unbelieving; they saw them twice the like of them; for God confirms with His help whom He will. Surely in that is a lesson for people of vision. When God wants an affair to be accomplished He makes many appear to be few in the eyes of one people and few to appear as many in the eyes of another people. If He covers the inner sight baṣīra of a people the sharpness of their physical eyes abṣār will not benefit them. When He opens the innermost selves of others the obstruction of their faculties of insight baṣāÌir will not harm them.
زُيِّنَ لِلنَّاسِ حُبُّ ٱلشَّهَوَاتِ مِنَ ٱلنِّسَاءِ وَٱلْبَنِينَ وَٱلْقَنَاطِيرِ ٱلْمُقَنْطَرَةِ مِنَ ٱلذَّهَبِ وَٱلْفِضَّةِ وَٱلْخَيْلِ ٱلْمُسَوَّمَةِ وَٱلأَنْعَامِ وَٱلْحَرْثِ ذٰلِكَ مَتَاعُ ٱلْحَيَاةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَٱللَّهُ عِنْدَهُ حُسْنُ ٱلْمَآبِ,Beautified for mankind is love of lusts-of women children stored-up heaps of gold and silver horses of high mark cattle and tillage. That is the comfort of the life of this world; but God-with Him is the more excellent abode. He mentions a few examples of lusts without distinguishing between them; included in the category is whatever veils you from witnessing shuhūd. The most difficult of obstacles on this path is hidden lust. According to them seeking pleasure by performing acts of obedience is counted in the category of hidden lust. Reliance on what comes to you from the various kinds of drawing near is among the problematic places of separation [on the path]. It is like the circumstance of someone confiding in you and flat- tering you. He describes and praises you with every pleasantry but beneath it there is a hidden deception. Felicity comes to you in the unveiling He grants to you through the witnessing shuhūd of His majesty and beauty. It does not come from His affirmation of [your] subtle states or what He chooses to grant [to you] in favors or drawing near..
قُلْ أَؤُنَبِّئُكُمْ بِخَيْرٍ مِّن ذٰلِكُمْ لِلَّذِينَ ٱتَّقَوْا عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ جَنَّاتٌ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلأَنْهَارُ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا وَأَزْوَاجٌ مُّطَهَّرَةٌ وَرِضْوَانٌ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَٱللَّهُ بَصِيرٌ بِٱلْعِبَادِ,Say: 'shall I tell you of something better than thatḍ For those that are fearful with their Lord are gardens underneath which rivers flow abiding therein and spouses purified and beatitude from God; and God is Seer of His servants. He explained the superiority of the people who have fear of God taqwā over the masters of the present world dunyā. He said “For these people are the following of desires munā and conforming to whims hawā and for those people are degrees of elevation ʿulā and God is Seer of His servants.” He has caused each people to alight in their rightful place and delivered each to what He has made most suitable for them.
ٱلَّذِينَ يَقُولُونَ رَبَّنَآ إِنَّنَآ آمَنَّا فَٱغْفِرْ لَنَا ذُنُوبَنَا وَقِنَا عَذَابَ ٱلنَّارِ,Those who say: “O Our Lord we believe; so forgive us our sins and guard us from the chastisement of the fire” that is “they occupy themselves with Us entirely bi-l-kulliya and plead for help before Us at the mention of severe trials and afflictions al-raziyya. Those obtain nearness and intimate friendship al-qurba wa-l-khuṣūṣiyya with Us high degrees wa-l-darajāt al-ʿuliyya and pleasing fates wa-l- qisam al-murḌiyya.”
ٱلصَّابِرِينَ وَٱلصَّادِقِينَ وَٱلْقَانِتِينَ وَٱلْمُنْفِقِينَ وَٱلْمُسْتَغْفِرِينَ بِٱلأَسْحَارِ,
,{ شَهِدَ ٱللَّهُ أَنَّهُ لاَ إِلَـٰهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ وَٱلْمَلاَئِكَةُ وَأُوْلُواْ ٱلْعِلْمِ قَآئِمَاً بِٱلْقِسْطِ لاَ إِلَـٰهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ }
God bears witness that there is no god except Him that is God knows God informs and God rules that there is no god except Him. It is the bearing witness shahāda of the Real to the Real that He is the Real. The first one to bear witness that He is God is God and He bears witness in all His eternity without beginning āzāl by His words His speaking and His eternal address. He has given information about His singular existence His unwavering being His everlasting unseen His continuous essence His infinite majesty and His endless beauty. Then He said God bears witness throughout all His eternity without end ābād. God bears witness that is God makes things clear by what He demonstrates in proofs barāhīn establishes in indicators of certainty dalāÌil al-yaqīn makes manifest with signs āyāt and discloses with indisputable evidence bayyināt. In all that He has created and brought forth and made manifest from [what was previously] concealed in [the realm of] non-existence and produced according to what He wills from independent things that are perceived aʿyān and the vanishing traces [left by things actions or attributes] āthār from the essential qualities of things dhawāt in their potentiality and the attributes ṣifāt which come to be in specific places-each part [of this whole] is a clear expression of His existence and a plain elucidation of His Lordship a witness shāhid to His Eternity and a notifier to the intellects that He is One wāḥid Mighty and Glorious mājid. He سبحانه bore witness to the majesty jalāl of His Measure and the perfection kamāl of His Might at the time when there was no denial no ignorance no knowledge of any created thing no intellect no conformity no disbelief no events no other no deviation no idolatry no understanding no falsehood no heaven no space no darkness no light no principles of what should be rejected wa-lā uṣūl li-l-mardūdāt34 and no judgments on differences in the affairs of time wa-lā fuṣūl bi-ikhtilāfi al-awqāt. and the angels He did not confirm His own bearing witness to His oneness waḥdāniyya by the bearing witness of the angels. Rather He gladdened and strength- ened them when He directed them to the right course of bearing witness to Him and when He guided them to knowledge of His oneness.,{ إِنَّ ٱلدِّينَ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ ٱلإِسْلاَمُ وَمَا ٱخْتَلَفَ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ ٱلْكِتَابَ إِلاَّ مِن بَعْدِ مَا جَآءَهُمُ ٱلْعِلْمُ بَغْياً بَيْنَهُمْ وَمَن يَكْفُرْ بِآيَاتِ ٱللَّهِ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ سَرِيعُ ٱلْحِسَابِ }
Lo the religion dīn with God is submission islām [to the One God]. Religion dīn: The [religion] that He is pleased with and the one whose follower He has determined to reward elevate and favor is submission islām. Submission islām is sincerity ikhlāṣ and the surrender of one- self istislām. Anything else is rejected mardūd and the path to salvation for its follower is blocked masdūd. Those who were given the scripture differed only after the knowledge came to them through transgression among themselves. And whoever disbe- lieves in God's signs God is swift in reckoning. Knowledge ʿilm came to them which was a proof ḥujja incumbent upon them-not [the deeper] knowledge maʿrifa which would be clear evi- dence bayān and a path maḥajja for them. They persisted in denial juḥūd because they were veiled from the place of witnessing shuhūd.,{ فَإنْ حَآجُّوكَ فَقُلْ أَسْلَمْتُ وَجْهِيَ للَّهِ وَمَنِ ٱتَّبَعَنِ وَقُلْ لِّلَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ وَٱلأُمِّيِّينَ أَأَسْلَمْتُمْ فَإِنْ أَسْلَمُواْ فَقَدِ ٱهْتَدَواْ وَّإِن تَوَلَّوْاْ فَإِنَّمَا عَلَيْكَ ٱلْبَلَٰغُ وَٱللَّهُ بَصِيرٌ بِٱلْعِبَادِ }
So if they dispute with you say: “I have surrendered my countenance to God and whoever follows me”: and say to those who have been given the scripture and to the uninstructed: “Have you submittedḍ” And so if they have submitted they have been guided but if they turn their backs your duty is only to deliver; and God sees His servants. “Look at them through the eye of [God's] free disposal taṣrīf so that your state does not become unsettled at the differences and the disparity of their stages. One who looks at created beings through the eye of [God's] delib- erative power qudra knows that the One who determines for all based on what He has chosen for each is One. Call them publicly when in public and bear witness privately to Our free disposal taṣrīf with regard to them when in private.” Occupy your tongue by counseling them but empty your heart of their talk and separate your innermost self from witnessing them for We have not charged you with their affairs [but only] with deliver[ing] [the message]. The One who brings about affairs and originates is Us.”,{ إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يَكْفُرُونَ بِآيَاتِ ٱللَّهِ وَيَقْتُلُونَ ٱلنَّبِيِّينَ بِغَيْرِ حَقٍّ وَيَقْتُلُونَ ٱلَّذِينَ يَأْمُرُونَ بِٱلْقِسْطِ مِنَ ٱلنَّاسِ فَبَشِّرْهُم بِعَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ }
Those who disbelieve in the signs of God and slay the prophets without right and slay those who enjoin to equity. So give them good tidings of a painful chastisement. “Those whom We have bound to disappointment khidhlān and branded with the state of deprivation ḥirmān-tell them that Our turning away from them is perpetual and that We have already determined their transference from one abode of disgrace hawān to another from disap- pointment khidhlān and deprivation ḥirmān to punishment and fires nīrān.”,{ أُولَـٰئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ حَبِطَتْ أَعْمَالُهُمْ فِي ٱلدُّنْيَا وَٱلآخِرَةِ وَمَا لَهُمْ مِّن نَّاصِرِينَ }
Those are the ones whose works have failed in this world and the here- after; they have no helpers. Those are the ones for whom no success is granted in their works tawfīq bi-aʿmāl today nor realization of their hopes taḥqīq li-āmāl tomorrow. That is only because they have lost Our help in both abodes and did not bear witness to Our might and power.,{ أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ نَصِيباً مِّنَ ٱلْكِتَابِ يُدْعَوْنَ إِلَىٰ كِتَابِ ٱللَّهِ لِيَحْكُمَ بَيْنَهُمْ ثُمَّ يَتَوَلَّىٰ فَرِيقٌ مِّنْهُمْ وَهُمْ مُّعْرِضُونَ }
Have you not seen those who were given a portion of the Book being called to the Book of God that it might decide between them and then a party of them turned away yatawallā opposedḍ [This means] “We have tested you with calling those whom We already know will not answer. So be patient with what you have been commanded regarding them. Know the misfortune of their states. They are the people who turn away ahl al-tawallī from answering ijāba because they have been deprived of the beauty of divine self-disclosure ḥusn al-tajallī by Our prior will irāda.”,{ ذٰلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ قَالُواْ لَن تَمَسَّنَا ٱلنَّارُ إِلاَّ أَيَّاماً مَّعْدُودَاتٍ وَغَرَّهُمْ فِي دِينِهِمْ مَّا كَانُواْ يَفْتَرُونَ }
That because they said “the fire shall not touch us except for a number of days”; and the lies they used to invent have deluded them in their religion. We have punished them in this world drawing them on by degrees bi-l- istidrāj until they [presume to] determine salvation and the lessening of punishment for themselves but they will come to know the doubling of affliction upon them. They think they understand something but they tell a lie. Those in error think that [what they have said] is a determination ḥukm.,{ فَكَيْفَ إِذَا جَمَعْنَاهُمْ لِيَوْمٍ لاَّ رَيْبَ فِيهِ وَوُفِّيَتْ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ مَّا كَسَبَتْ وَهُمْ لاَ يُظْلَمُونَ }
But how will it be when We gather them for a day of which there is no doubt and every soul shall be paid in full what it has earned and they shall not be wrongedḍ This address is remarkable because by it He gives information about the imposing grandeur and intensity of the [Day of Gathering] at which point the intellects [of those who turned away] will be perplexed their innermost selves astonished their pretensions cut off their hearts torn from their hidden places and [their souls] will rise to their collar bones. Then there will be what will meet them from the reckoning and censure al-ḥisāb wa-l- ʿitāb the torment and punishment al-ʿadhāb wa-l-ʿiqāb and the lack of honoring and approval ʿadam al-ikrām wa-l-ījāb etc. The resurrection of the disbelievers will take place on the Day of Gathering while the resurrection of the lovers takes place in the present moment; to explain this fully would take a long time.,{ قُلِ ٱللَّهُمَّ مَالِكَ ٱلْمُلْكِ تُؤْتِي ٱلْمُلْكَ مَن تَشَآءُ وَتَنزِعُ ٱلْمُلْكَ مِمَّنْ تَشَآءُ وَتُعِزُّ مَن تَشَآءُ وَتُذِلُّ مَن تَشَآءُ بِيَدِكَ ٱلْخَيْرُ إِنَّكَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ }
Say: “O God Allāhumma Master of the kingdom Allāhumma: Its meaning is “O God yā Allāh.” The letter mīm at the end of the word is a substitute for the vocative particle yā. This is a teaching of the Real on how to praise the Real that is “describe Me as I should be described in exalted measure” by saying: “O Master of the kingdom there is no associate to You no assistant no helper no companion no partner to You in essence no sharer in the kingdom no competitor in creating.” you give the kingdom to whom You will and seize the kingdom from whom You will; “... so that we will know that You are the King.” Among created beings the king is he before whom one is humbled and the kingdom that is seized is the kingdom of those who are haughty toward him. [In a similar manner] created beings are beautified tajammul by abasing themselves tadhallul60 before the Real. Their honor and might ʿizz61 is in their effacement maḥw in Him and their remaining baqāÌ is in their annihilation fanāÌ in Him. You exalt tuʿizzu whom You will by the might ʿizz of Your essence. and You abase tudhillu whom You will; by Your forsaking. You exalt whom you will guiding him to witness You and declare Your oneness and You abase whom You will such that he denies You and is deprived of You. You exalt whom you will with the good fortune of Your drawing near and You abase whom You will by the estrangement of Your turning away. You exalt whom You will by bringing him to intimacy with You and You abase whom You will by estranging him from You. You exalt whom You will by occupying him with You and You abase whom You will by distracting him from You. You exalt whom You will by eliminating the controlling elements of his lower self and You abase whom You will by giving the upper hand to its clamor. You exalt whom You will by the gleams of the rising Ṭawāliʿ of his intimacy [with You] and You abase whom You will by the night visitors Ṭawāriq of his lower self. You exalt whom You will by expanding basṬ him through You and You abase whom You will by constricting qabḌ him from You.,{ تُولِجُ ٱللَّيْلَ فِي ٱلْنَّهَارِ وَتُولِجُ ٱلنَّهَارَ فِي ٱلْلَّيْلِ وَتُخْرِجُ ٱلْحَيَّ مِنَ ٱلْمَيِّتِ وَتُخْرِجُ ٱلَمَيِّتَ مِنَ ٱلْحَيِّ وَتَرْزُقُ مَن تَشَآءُ بِغَيْرِ حِسَابٍ }
You make the night pass into the day and You make the day to pass into the night; You bring forth the living from the dead and You bring forth the dead from the living You provide whom You will without reckoning. You make the night pass into the day such that the authority of the light of unity tawḥīd prevails and nothing remains of the traces of the lower self and its darknesses. You make the day pass into the night so that it is as if the suns of the hearts were eclipsed or as if the night continued and the morning never came. You bring forth the living from the dead such that it is as if listlessness was no more and the pledge of union returned as a youth and the prom- ises of hearts became young and fresh. You bring forth the dead from the living such that it is as if the tree of discontent sprouted and blossomed thorns and as if the hopeless found nothing good and could not smell [the fragrance] and their hearts and eyes were confounded just as they did not believe in it the first time [6:110]. You provide whom You will without reckoning such that there is no labor kadd no exertion jahd no sweat on the brow jabīn and no toil of the right hand yamīn. His night is refreshment and repose rāḥa and His day is joy and delight bahja. His hours are special gifts karāmāt and His moments are ways of drawing near qurubāt. The different kinds of acts of His favoring cannot be enumerated by the tongue lisān and the inquiry into their full depth cannot be given expression or explanation bayān. But in the glimmers we have given here there is some indication of how to speak of this. It is said that when He said “and seize the kingdom from whom You will” [3:26] anyone who thinks that he is a king [experiences] a rude awakening from [his] drunken intoxication because he now sees [that] his kingdom is vulnerable to extinction and [he] knows that abasing himself to [God] in preserving His kingdom is worthier than vainglorious delusion and pomposity. It is said that the king-in the true sense of the word-is someone who is not distracted by anything from witnessing the One who is the real King.,{ لاَّ يَتَّخِذِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ ٱلْكَافِرِينَ أَوْلِيَآءَ مِن دُونِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَمَن يَفْعَلْ ذٰلِكَ فَلَيْسَ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ فِي شَيْءٍ إِلاَّ أَن تَتَّقُواْ مِنْهُمْ تُقَـٰةً وَيُحَذِّرُكُمُ ٱللَّهُ نَفْسَهُ وَإِلَىٰ ٱللَّهِ ٱلْمَصِيرُ }
Let not the believers take the disbelievers as patrons awliyāÌ rather than the believers- Among the realities of faith is friendship muwālāt with God and enmity muʿādāt on behalf of God. From among the disbelievers it would be best for you to renounce and turn away from your lower self. Its nature is Magian in that it says “Mine from me and through me.” God most high said O you who believe fight those of the disbelievers who are near to you [yalūnakum] [9:123]. Verily faith in this path Ṭarīqa is rare and precious. Even if ordinary people who have no faith in this path were to wear themselves out with extreme asceticism and effort they would not be among those people [who are] Your friends. It is more fitting that like be with like. for whoever does that does not belong to God in any way-unless you protect yourselves against them as a safeguard. God warns you of His Self: and to God is the journey's end. Companionship ṣuḥba with the Real سبحانه and nearness to Him can by no means be combined with the companionship of adversaries and being close to them. God warns you of His Self: This is an address to the elect among the people of deeper knowledge ahl al-maʿrifa. As for those whose degree is less than that He said to them “And fear the fire that…” [3:131] and He said “And fear a day wherein you shall be returned...” [2:281] and so on in other verses. It is said that God warns you of His Self [means that while] you may be of the opinion that you have arrived surely the imperceptible affairs of the divine deception makr can happen to the most respected. The one who spoke for them said: I felt safe from him but the safe place granted to me was a ruse. Such it is for those who feel safe from lovers. It is said that God warns you of His Self because anyone who imagines that a created being can reach Him or that the feet of human aspiration can touch the carpet of might-Glory and Might be to the absolute oneness! And anyone who thinks that [God] has brought them near in reality [God] has made them distant from Him.,{ قُلْ إِن تُخْفُواْ مَا فِي صُدُورِكُمْ أَوْ تُبْدُوهُ يَعْلَمْهُ ٱللَّهُ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ }
Say: “Whether you hide what is in your breasts or disclose it God knows it and knows what is in the heavens and what is in the earth; and God is Able to do all things.” There is nothing that escapes His knowledge so do not be grieved by any calamity that afflicts you. Soon He will bring you succor and response and soon the affliction and trial will disappear. He will hasten [His] assistance and protection.,{ يَوْمَ تَجِدُ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ مَّا عَمِلَتْ مِنْ خَيْرٍ مُّحْضَراً وَمَا عَمِلَتْ مِن سُوۤءٍ تَوَدُّ لَوْ أَنَّ بَيْنَهَا وَبَيْنَهُ أَمَدَاً بَعِيداً وَيُحَذِّرُكُمُ ٱللَّهُ نَفْسَهُ وَٱللَّهُ رَؤُوفٌ بِٱلْعِبَادِ }
The day every soul shall find present before it what it has done of good and what it has done of evil it will wish that between it and that there were a great distance. The people [of acts] of obedience ahl al-Ṭāʿāt will wish that they had sought more of them. The people [of acts] of opposition ahl al-mukhālafāt will wish that they had curbed in their reins from galloping in the open fields. The one who spoke for them said: Even if I had been given the object of my desire in my time here on earth not everyone who is granted the object of his desire is pointed in the right direction. Then I would have said to the days gone by: Will you not returnḍ And I would have said to the days to come: Will you not keep your distanceḍ God warns you of His self and God is kind to His servants. The allusion from His words God warns you of His Self is for those with deeper knowledge ʿārifūn and the allusion from His words and God is kind to His servants is for novices. [The first] follow rigor and submit humbly and [the latter] follow [the way of] lightened burdens and ease. And it is said that when He said “God warns you of His Self” those hear- ing the address are understandably frightened so He said in combination with it and God is kind to His servants in order to give them reason to hope. Thus His way sunna is to evoke desire and fear in them at the same time. It is said that He annihilates you in His saying “God warns you of His Self” then brings you back to life and causes you to remain by His saying “and God is kind to His servants.”,{ قُلْ إِن كُنتُمْ تُحِبُّونَ ٱللَّهَ فَٱتَّبِعُونِي يُحْبِبْكُمُ ٱللَّهُ وَيَغْفِرْ لَكُمْ ذُنُوبَكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ }
Say: “If you love God follow me and God will love you and forgive you your sins; God is Forgiving Merciful. You love God is a separation farq and God loves you is a gathering jamʿ. You love God [with a love] mixed with cause ʿilla but God loves you without cause; rather He is the reality of communion. The love of the ser- vant for God is a state of subtle kindness laṬīfa that he finds within himself and this state brings him into conformity muwāfaqa with [God's] com- mand out of [his own] pleasure riḌāÌ without any feeling of aversion. This state necessarily involves his preferring [God] سبحانه over everything and everyone. The precondition of love is that there is no worldly concern ḥaẓẓ in any state. One who has not been entirely annihilated from his worldly concerns possesses not even a sliver of love. The love of the Real for the servant is in His desire irāda His benefi- cence iḥsān and His kindness luṬf to him. It is a desire irāda to bestow favor which may be [seen] in [the servant's] praise and commendation of Him سبحانه or it may be [seen] in [God's] favoring [the servant] which would be [understood as] coming from the attributes of His acts. It is said that the precondition of love is your entire effacement from yourself because you are consumed in your beloved. The one who spoke for them said: What is love until the eye is exhausted by weeping and you lose your ability to talk so that you cannot answer one who calls you. There is a difference between the beloved al-ḥabīb and the friend al-khalīl. The friend [Abraham] said “so whoever follows me verily belongs with me” minnī [14:36] and the beloved [Muḥammad] said “fol- low me and God will love you.” The follower of the friend belongs with him minhu in the favor conferred [on both of them by God] while the follower of the beloved is loved by the Real سبحانه-this suffices as a station of nearness and state. It is said that for those who submit themselves He cuts off their long- ing for anything other than their model and leader of the first and the last-Muḥammad ﷺ. It is said that this verse alludes to the fact that love is not an effect maʿlūl and is not brought about by obedient acts or the avoidance of bad things because He said “God will love you and forgive you your sins.,{ قُلْ أَطِيعُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَٱلرَّسُولَ فإِن تَوَلَّوْاْ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لاَ يُحِبُّ ٱلْكَافِرِينَ }
Say: “Obey God and the Messenger.” But if they turn their backs God loves not the disbelievers. He commanded them to obedience and then He said “But if they turn their backs” that is fall short in obedience by opposing [God's command] then God loves not the disbelievers. He did not say “the disobedient” ʿāṣūn but rather “the disbelievers” kāfirūn so the address indicates that He loves the believers even if they are disobedient.,{ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ ٱصْطَفَىٰ ءَادَمَ وَنُوحاً وَآلَ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَآلَ عِمْرَانَ عَلَى ٱلْعَالَمِينَ } * { ذُرِّيَّةً بَعْضُهَا مِن بَعْضٍ وَٱللَّهُ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ }
Lo! God preferred Adam and Noah and the house of Abraham and the house of ʿImrān above the worlds the seed of one another; God is Hearer Knower. Adam and his seed are made of the same substance but the characteristic of being chosen iṣṬifāÌ is something that comes from [God] not through lineage or relation.,{ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ ٱصْطَفَىٰ ءَادَمَ وَنُوحاً وَآلَ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَآلَ عِمْرَانَ عَلَى ٱلْعَالَمِينَ } * { ذُرِّيَّةً بَعْضُهَا مِن بَعْضٍ وَٱللَّهُ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ }

When the wife of ʿImrān said “Lord I have vowed to You what is within my womb as a consecration muḥarraran. Accept this from me. Lo! It is You who are the Hearer Knower. [3:36] And when she gave birth to her she said “Lord I have given birth to a female”-and God knew very well what she had given birth to-the male is not as the female. “And I have named her Mary and commend her to You with her seed to protect them from the accursed Satan.” The one who is consecrated muḥarrar is someone who is not in bondage to any created being. The Real سبحانه in His prior decree has emancipated such a person from the bondage of preoccupation [with anything other than the Real] in all aspects and states. When the mother of Mary made this vow and gave birth to a female she was ashamed. When she saw her she said “Lord I have given birth to a female who cannot be consecrated.” God most high said “and God knew very well what she had given birth to.” By my life the male is not like the female outwardly but when the Real سبحانه وتعالى accepted her every miracle appeared from her. When she said “I have vowed to You what is within my womb as a consecration” she added “Accept this from me.” He granted her request and the effects of the acceptance appeared in [Mary] and her son. One set of beings was saved by their story and another was destroyed and expe- rienced a trial fitna because of the two of them. She said “And I have named her Mary and commend her to You with her seed to protect them from the accursed Satan.” She sought protection from God from anything in her words that [might] belong to Satan.,{ إِذْ قَالَتِ ٱمْرَأَتُ عِمْرَانَ رَبِّ إِنِّي نَذَرْتُ لَكَ مَا فِي بَطْنِي مُحَرَّراً فَتَقَبَّلْ مِنِّي إِنَّكَ أَنتَ ٱلسَّمِيعُ ٱلْعَلِيمُ } * { فَلَمَّا وَضَعَتْهَا قَالَتْ رَبِّ إِنِّي وَضَعْتُهَآ أُنْثَىٰ وَٱللَّهُ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا وَضَعَتْ وَلَيْسَ ٱلذَّكَرُ كَٱلأُنْثَىٰ وَإِنِّي سَمَّيْتُهَا مَرْيَمَ وِإِنِّي أُعِيذُهَا بِكَ وَذُرِّيَّتَهَا مِنَ ٱلشَّيْطَانِ ٱلرَّجِيمِ }

Her Lord accepted the child with gracious acceptance and made her grow excellently and Zachariah took charge of her. He caused [Mary] to attain more than what her mother had wished for. It is said that [God] accepted her with a gracious acceptance qabūl ḥasan by making her unique in obedience to Him and entrusting her with that which He entrusts His friends awliyāÌ-so much so that every person of her time was astonished by the excellence ḥusn of that which He had entrusted to her even though she was a girl. It is said that the gracious acceptance was the excellence ḥusn of [God's] care for her in spite of His سبحانه knowing what would be said about Him because of her for He is not concerned with the shamefulness of the words of enemies. I find blame in passion for you sweet. Out of love of hearing you mentioned let them blame me. Just as it is said: Let anyone who wishes say what he wishes. I do not care! It is also said that the gracious acceptance was His causing her to grow preserved [from sin and error] ʿiṣma until she said: Lo! I seek refuge in the Compassionate One from you! If you fear God [19:18]. And made her grow excellently until she stood straight in obedience and preferred His سبحانه good pleasure in every moment and until the fruit from her was such a person as Jesus عليه السلام. This was the excellent growth. Zachariah took charge of her and it was part of [God's] gracious acceptance and [His granting her] excellent growth that He made one such as Zachariah عليه السلام among the prophets her guardian and the caretaker and protector of her affairs. God revealed to David عليه السلام “If you see someone seeking me become a servant to him in raÌayta lī Ṭāliban fa-kun lahu khādiman.” Whenever Zachariah went into the sanctuary where she was he found her with provisions. “O Mary” he said”Whence comes this to youḍ” She said “From God. Truly God provides for whomever He will without reckoning.” Among the signs of [God's] gracious acceptance was that she could never be found anywhere except in the sanctuary miḥrāb. Whoever dwells and stays where He is worshiped where the sanctuary is-that is a rare and precious servant.,{ هُنَالِكَ دَعَا زَكَرِيَّا رَبَّهُ قَالَ رَبِّ هَبْ لِي مِن لَّدُنْكَ ذُرِّيَّةً طَيِّبَةً إِنَّكَ سَمِيعُ ٱلدُّعَآءِ }
Then Zachariah prayed to his Lord saying “Lord bestow upon me from You a goodly offspring verily You are the Hearer of supplication.” That is when he saw the special gift karāma of God سبحانه with her he grew increasingly certain and ever more hopeful so he asked for a son in spite of his advanced age. The granting of his request was a rupture of ordinary reality naqḌ al-ʿāda. It is said that Zachariah عليه السلام asked for a son to help him in obedience and an heir from his progeny in prophethood so that he might uphold the right of God ḥaqq Allāh. So it was a request which deserved to be granted. When a request is for the right of the Real ḥaqq al-ḥaqq and not for the worldly concerns of the lower self ḥaẓẓ al-nafs He will not refuse it. Zachariah عليه السلام saw Mary with summer fruits in the winter and winter fruits in the summer so he asked for a son in his old age so that it might be a sign āya and a miracle muʿjiza.,{ فَنَادَتْهُ ٱلْمَلاۤئِكَةُ وَهُوَ قَائِمٌ يُصَلِّي فِي ٱلْمِحْرَابِ أَنَّ اللَّهَ يُبَشِّرُكَ بِيَحْيَـىٰ مُصَدِّقاً بِكَلِمَةٍ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَسَيِّداً وَحَصُوراً وَنَبِيّاً مِّنَ ٱلصَّالِحِينَ }
And the angels called to him as he stood praying in the sanctuary at worship When the petitioner asks and remains at the door the request is granted to him. This alludes to the fact that anyone who needs something from kings should remain at the door until the request is granted. It is said that the ruling of God سبحانه is such that He only responds to the request of those who embrace service khidma to Him and He casts those who turn away from obedience into the lowliness of estrangement. that “God gives you good tidings of John who shall confirm a word from God; a lord and one chaste and a prophet of the righteous.” It is said that he named him John Yaḥyā because of the life ḥayāt of his heart through God. Exegetical writings tell us that the barrenness of his mother was brought to life ḥayy through him. It is said that [the name means] the quickening of life in the heart of one who believes in Him. His saying who shall confirm a word from God Allāh means his con- firmation of the word Allāh by which he worshiped Him or that he was brought into being by the word of God. His saying a lord: The lord is one who is not in bondage to any created thing. He has been freed taḥarrara from captivity to whims and from [captivity to] any created thing. It is said that the lord is someone who has actualized his servanthood ʿubūdiyya to [God] سبحانه. It is said that the lord is the one who is superior to the people of his age and John was such. It is said lord because he did not seek any station for himself nor did he view himself as having any worth. When he dedicated himself in humility to God in every way [God] caused him to rise above the group and made him a lord to all. His saying and one chaste that is liberated from passions and spared from carnal human properties despite being human. It is said that [it means] being protected from the demands of his lower self restrained from that through [his] engagement in exaltation [of God] and seeking to draw near [to Him]. It is said his restraint came from being uprooted by the intuitions of realities coming to him such that he no longer had any preference for worldly things. And a prophet of the righteous that is he was worthy of attaining their rank.,{ قَالَ رَبِّ أَنَّىٰ يَكُونُ لِي غُلاَمٌ وَقَدْ بَلَغَنِي ٱلْكِبَرُ وَٱمْرَأَتِي عَاقِرٌ قَالَ كَذَلِكَ ٱللَّهُ يَفْعَلُ مَا يَشَآءُ }
He said “My Lord! How shall I have a boy when old age has overtaken me and my wife is barrenḍ” He said 'so it will be.” “God does what He will.” It is said that there was a long time between his petition and the reply and because of that he said “How shall I have a boyḍ” It may mean that he said “By what right would I receive a response [to my prayer] if not by Your favorḍ”93 It may mean that he said “How shall this be: by adoption or sexual procreationḍ” It may mean that [he questioned] whether this was to be from a woman other than his wife since she was [also] of advanced age [that is] from taking a slave as a concubine. So it was said to him “No not through these means for both you and your wife have suffered loneliness together so the good news of the son is for both of you.”,{ قَالَ رَبِّ ٱجْعَلْ لِّيۤ آيَةً قَالَ آيَتُكَ أَلاَّ تُكَلِّمَ ٱلنَّاسَ ثَلاَثَةَ أَيَّامٍ إِلاَّ رَمْزاً وَٱذْكُر رَّبَّكَ كَثِيراً وَسَبِّحْ بِٱلْعَشِيِّ وَٱلإِبْكَارِ }
He said “My Lord! Appoint for me a sign.” He said “Your sign is that you shall not speak to men save by tokens for three days. He sought the sign so that he might know when [his prayer] would be answered not because of any doubt regarding the source of this response. [God] made the sign of His proof that [Zachariah's] tongue was held [silenced] with created beings even as he was left free to glorify God. That is to say [God said] “do not refrain from speaking with Me for I do not deprive My friends of My intimate conversations munājāt.” and remember your Lord often...in your heart and your tongue in every moment. and glorify [Him] at evening and dawn”...in persistent prayer ṣalāt.,{ وَإِذْ قَالَتِ ٱلْمَلاَئِكَةُ يٰمَرْيَمُ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ ٱصْطَفَـٰكِ وَطَهَّرَكِ وَٱصْطَفَـٰكِ عَلَىٰ نِسَآءِ ٱلْعَـٰلَمِينَ }
And when the angels said “O Mary God has preferred you and made you pure; He has preferred you above all women of the worlds.” It is possible that this was the beginning of a message from the angels to Mary elevating her state. It is possible that she may have heard their words and seen them or that she did not see them but heard them as a voice call- ing out to her: “God has preferred you by your being favored and singled out from among your kind and peers and made you pure from what is indecent and sinful with a beautiful immunity and [pure] from having physical contact with men. He has preferred you above all women of the worlds in your time.” The point of repeating the mention of her being preferred is first “He has chosen you through special gifts position and an exalted state”; and second “He has chosen you to bear Jesus عليه السلام without a father and no woman can ever be compared to you until the Day of Resurrection.” Because of that He said “above all women of the worlds.”,{ يٰمَرْيَمُ ٱقْنُتِي لِرَبِّكِ وَٱسْجُدِي وَٱرْكَعِي مَعَ ٱلرَّاكِعِينَ }
“O Mary be obedient to your Lord prostrating and bowing with those who bow.” “Persevere on the carpet of worship and practice obedience continually. Do not fall short from continuous service khidma. The Real has singled you out by your station so be without equal in your time in your worship of Him.”,{ ذٰلِكَ مِنْ أَنَبَآءِ ٱلْغَيْبِ نُوحِيهِ إِلَيكَ وَمَا كُنتَ لَدَيْهِمْ إِذْ يُلْقُون أَقْلاَمَهُمْ أَيُّهُمْ يَكْفُلُ مَرْيَمَ وَمَا كُنْتَ لَدَيْهِمْ إِذْ يَخْتَصِمُونَ }
That is of the tidings of the unseen. We reveal it to you for you were not with them when they were casting quills which of them should have charge of Mary; nor were you with them when they were disputing. That is “We have told you [Muḥammad] of these stories and have spoken with you about their meanings. Although We have related these stories to you Our speech is rare and precious-it is more valuable and more perfect than if you yourself had been a witness to [these events].”,{ إِذْ قَالَتِ ٱلْمَلاۤئِكَةُ يٰمَرْيَمُ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُبَشِّرُكِ بِكَلِمَةٍ مِّنْهُ ٱسْمُهُ ٱلْمَسِيحُ عِيسَى ٱبْنُ مَرْيَمَ وَجِيهاً فِي ٱلدُّنْيَا وَٱلآخِرَةِ وَمِنَ ٱلْمُقَرَّبِينَ } * { وَيُكَلِّمُ ٱلنَّاسَ فِي ٱلْمَهْدِ وَكَهْلاً وَمِنَ ٱلصَّالِحِينَ }
When the angels said “O Mary God gives you good tidings of a word from Him whose name is the Messiah Jesus son of Mary honored shall he be in this world and the hereafter and of those brought close. He shall speak to mankind in the cradle and in his manhood and he is of the righteous.” She was not given good tidings about her portion in this world or her fortunes in the hereafter. Rather she was given good tidings verifying that [she was receiving a] tremendous sign in [the birth of Jesus] and [that] he was a prophet of God-it was a confirmation of the miracle. It is said that He informed her that whoever succumbs to the over- whelming force of the divine power qudra and ends up before His ruling ḥukm will encounter miracles of that power the likes of which no one has experienced. Mary had surely lived for a long time with an excellent reputation and was well-known as a chaste [woman] but then [God] caused confusion about her situation [when she] appeared in a state deemed blame- worthy by people. In actuality it was not as the foolish thought. Their eyes were blocked from seeing the flow of the divine decree jaryān al-taqdīr. It is said that He informed her of what would happen to [her son] step by step and in detail. He told her that he would live in such as way that he shall speak to mankind as a young child and in his manhood and that the deception of [his] enemies would not affect him. It is said in manhood [means] after his descent from the heavens. It is said that He fortified her heart by informing her that while she herself would hold her tongue regarding her innocence [after the birth] God would cause Jesus عليه السلام to speak [as a child] as proof of her sincerity and exalted honor.,{ إِذْ قَالَتِ ٱلْمَلاۤئِكَةُ يٰمَرْيَمُ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُبَشِّرُكِ بِكَلِمَةٍ مِّنْهُ ٱسْمُهُ ٱلْمَسِيحُ عِيسَى ٱبْنُ مَرْيَمَ وَجِيهاً فِي ٱلدُّنْيَا وَٱلآخِرَةِ وَمِنَ ٱلْمُقَرَّبِينَ } * { وَيُكَلِّمُ ٱلنَّاسَ فِي ٱلْمَهْدِ وَكَهْلاً وَمِنَ ٱلصَّالِحِينَ }

She said “Lord how shall I have a child when no mortal has touched meḍ” He said “It is such. God creates what He will. Just as you witnessed the appearance of things contrary to ordinary reality in the provision We gave [to you] likewise We will break with ordinary reality by creating a son without a man having touched [you]. When He decrees a thing that is He desires a ruling ḥukm to come to pass He says to it only: 'Be' and it is. Producing [things] from the beginning and bringing [them] forth are not difficult for Him. When they began to blame her God caused Jesus عليه السلام to speak when he was [only] one day old; [he] said “I have come to you with a sign from your Lord” [3:49].,{ وَيُعَلِّمُهُ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ وَٱلْحِكْمَةَ وَٱلتَّوْرَاةَ وَٱلإِنْجِيلَ } * { وَرَسُولاً إِلَىٰ بَنِيۤ إِسْرَائِيلَ أَنِّي قَدْ جِئْتُكُمْ بِآيَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ أَنِيۤ أَخْلُقُ لَكُمْ مِّنَ ٱلطِّينِ كَهَيْئَةِ ٱلطَّيْرِ فَأَنفُخُ فِيهِ فَيَكُونُ طَيْراً بِإِذْنِ ٱللَّهِ وَأُبْرِىءُ ٱلأَكْمَهَ وٱلأَبْرَصَ وَأُحْيِ ٱلْمَوْتَىٰ بِإِذْنِ ٱللَّهِ وَأُنَبِّئُكُمْ بِمَا تَأْكُلُونَ وَمَا تَدَّخِرُونَ فِي بُيُوتِكُمْ إِنَّ فِي ذٰلِكَ لآيَةً لَّكُمْ إِن كُنتُم مُّؤْمِنِينَ }
And He will teach him the Book wisdom and the Torah and the Gospel. To be a messenger to the children of Israel “I have come to you with a sign from your Lord I will create for you out of clay [something] like the shape of a bird then I will breathe into it and it will be a bird by the leave of God. I will also heal the blind and the leper; and I bring the dead to life by the leave of God. I will inform you too of what things you eat and what you treasure up in your houses. Surely in that is a sign for you if you are believers.” These were His outward signs and dazzling overpowering proofs: bring- ing life to the dead healing the blind and the leper telling [them] what they did secretly and other miracles. [God] stated that [Jesus] confirmed what came before him in laws but was chosen to abrogate part of what came before and to establish another part for them according to the details articulated in the QurÌān.,{ وَيُعَلِّمُهُ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ وَٱلْحِكْمَةَ وَٱلتَّوْرَاةَ وَٱلإِنْجِيلَ } * { وَرَسُولاً إِلَىٰ بَنِيۤ إِسْرَائِيلَ أَنِّي قَدْ جِئْتُكُمْ بِآيَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ أَنِيۤ أَخْلُقُ لَكُمْ مِّنَ ٱلطِّينِ كَهَيْئَةِ ٱلطَّيْرِ فَأَنفُخُ فِيهِ فَيَكُونُ طَيْراً بِإِذْنِ ٱللَّهِ وَأُبْرِىءُ ٱلأَكْمَهَ وٱلأَبْرَصَ وَأُحْيِ ٱلْمَوْتَىٰ بِإِذْنِ ٱللَّهِ وَأُنَبِّئُكُمْ بِمَا تَأْكُلُونَ وَمَا تَدَّخِرُونَ فِي بُيُوتِكُمْ إِنَّ فِي ذٰلِكَ لآيَةً لَّكُمْ إِن كُنتُم مُّؤْمِنِينَ }

Likewise confirming that which was before me of the Torah and to make lawful for you some of that which was forbidden to you. I have come to you with a sign from your Lord: so fear God and obey me. Surely God is my Lord and your Lord so worship Him. This is a straight path.” And when Jesus sensed their disbelief he said “Who will be my helpers [in the cause of] Godḍ” The disciples said “We will be helpers of God; we believe in God; witness that we have submitted. When the message reached them and they differed-some of them believed him and some of them called him a liar and they were the majority-he came to know that prophecy does not spare one from affliction and the oppression of enemies. So [Jesus] separated his heart from them and held to his goal qaṣd. He said to his people “Who will be my helpers [in the cause of] God so that they may help me in my exclusive devotion to His true reality and sincere dedication to His goalḍ” Then those who were touched by the effects of [God's] providence āthār al-ʿināya and chosen through the effects of [divine] selection āthār al-takhṣīṣ said “We will be helpers of God; we believe in God; bear witness to us in truth and let nothing come from us that would cast doubt on you.”,{ وَمُصَدِّقاً لِّمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيَّ مِنَ ٱلتَّوْرَاةِ وَلأُحِلَّ لَكُم بَعْضَ ٱلَّذِي حُرِّمَ عَلَيْكُمْ وَجِئْتُكُمْ بِآيَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ فَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَأَطِيعُونِ } * { إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ رَبِّي وَرَبُّكُمْ فَٱعْبُدُوهُ هَـٰذَا صِرَاطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ } * { فَلَمَّآ أَحَسَّ عِيسَىٰ مِنْهُمُ ٱلْكُفْرَ قَالَ مَنْ أَنصَارِيۤ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ قَالَ ٱلْحَوَارِيُّونَ نَحْنُ أَنْصَارُ ٱللَّهِ آمَنَّا بِٱللَّهِ وَٱشْهَدْ بِأَنَّا مُسْلِمُونَ }

When God said “O Jesus I am gathering you and raising you to Me and I am cleansing you of those who disbelieved The allusion in it: “I am gathering you from yourself seizing you from yourself raising you above the mortal human attributes and purifying you from your own desire irāda completely so that you will act as Our agent muṣarrif through Us and for Us. You will have no free choice ikhtiyār in anything. In its place divine governorship tawallī will descend upon you and stand in for you.” By this quality the dead were brought to life through the hands [of Jesus]. These were occurrences that could only happen by the divine deliberative power may it be exalted. It is said that He purified his heart from looking to others aghyār and from seeing simulacra and traces al-amthāl wa-l-āthār in all states and phases al-aḥwāl wa-l-aṬwār. and I am setting those who follow you above those who disbelieved until the Day of Resurrection In help nuṣra force qahr and proof ḥujja. His followers-those who have not changed his religion dīn and those who follow his creed ʿaqīda in the declaration of oneness tawḥīd-are believers muÌminūn. They are in the right until the Day of Resurrection and they will be helped [by God] until the Day of Resurrection. Then God سبحانه will judge between them and their enemies on that day. The disbelievers will be in hellfire ammā l-kuffār fa-fī l-jaḥīm and the believers will be in felicity wa-ammā l-muÌminūn fa-fī l-naʿīm. Then to Me shall be your return and I will decide between you as to what you were at variance about.,{ فَأَمَّا ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ فَأُعَذِّبُهُمْ عَذَاباً شَدِيداً فِي ٱلدُّنْيَا وَٱلآخِرَةِ وَمَا لَهُمْ مِّن نَّاصِرِينَ } * { وَأَمَّا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ فَيُوَفِّيهِمْ أُجُورَهُمْ وَٱللَّهُ لاَ يُحِبُّ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ } * { ذٰلِكَ نَتْلُوهُ عَلَيْكَ مِنَ الآيَاتِ وَٱلذِّكْرِ ٱلْحَكِيمِ }
As for the disbelievers I will chastise them with a terrible chastisement in this world and the hereafter; they shall have no helpers. But as for the believers who do deeds of righteousness He will pay them in full their wages. God loves not the evildoers. This We recite to you of verses and wise remembrance. “This We recite to you O Muḥammad to inform you of the meanings of what We have revealed to you. [These meanings do not reach you] through your exertion to attain knowledge nor by your learning from parables nor by your deduction by any sort of reasoning.”,{ فَأَمَّا ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ فَأُعَذِّبُهُمْ عَذَاباً شَدِيداً فِي ٱلدُّنْيَا وَٱلآخِرَةِ وَمَا لَهُمْ مِّن نَّاصِرِينَ } * { وَأَمَّا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ فَيُوَفِّيهِمْ أُجُورَهُمْ وَٱللَّهُ لاَ يُحِبُّ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ } * { ذٰلِكَ نَتْلُوهُ عَلَيْكَ مِنَ الآيَاتِ وَٱلذِّكْرِ ٱلْحَكِيمِ }

Truly the likeness of Jesus in God's sight is as Adam's likeness. He chose to purify the spirit rūḥ in them from the act of passing from one body to another tanāsukh in the loins but He singled out Adam as the first [of men] while He singled out Jesus عليه السلام for the special distinc- tion of breathing the spirit into him in the most exalted way. But even though these two were weighty beings the imperfection of being in time and being mortal was nonetheless unavoidable for them: He created him of dust then He said to him “Be” and he was [3:59].,{ ٱلْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّكَ فَلاَ تَكُنْ مِّن ٱلْمُمْتَرِينَ }
The truth is from your Lord; be not of those who waver. [That is] “The truth al-ḥaqq is from your Lord O Muḥammad. Have no doubt that there is no one who resembles Him سبحانه in causing existence and no created being has any power over the establishment of His way. The existence wujūd of existents mawjūdāt has been conferred from the concealment of nonexistence katm al-ʿadam-their beginning is from God and to Him is their return.”,{ فَمَنْ حَآجَّكَ فِيهِ مِن بَعْدِ مَا جَآءَكَ مِنَ ٱلْعِلْمِ فَقُلْ تَعَالَوْاْ نَدْعُ أَبْنَآءَنَا وَأَبْنَآءَكُمْ وَنِسَآءَنَا وَنِسَآءَكُمْ وَأَنْفُسَنَا وأَنْفُسَكُمْ ثُمَّ نَبْتَهِلْ فَنَجْعَل لَّعْنَتَ ٱللَّهِ عَلَى ٱلْكَاذِبِينَ }
And whoever disputes with you concerning him after the knowledge that has come to you say: “Come! Let us call our sons and your sons our wives and your wives our selves and your selves then let us humbly pray and invoke God's curse upon those who lie.” And whoever disputes with you concerning him means that “After you have sincerely proclaimed what you were told and have come to know the truth of the knowledge We imparted to you in your heart do not be reticent in challenging them to mutual cursing. Trust that you have the force qahr and help nuṣra and that We are protecting you and have sheltered you in the wing of Our nearness.” If they had sought this mutual cursing the valley would have rained fire down upon them but God سبحانه gave them respite because He knew of the believers [yet to come] of their progeny. This verse alludes to those whose states are no longer those of the sincere ṣiddīqūn. When the lights [of the sincere] appear what remains in [the others] fades away completely.,{ إِنَّ هَـٰذَا لَهُوَ ٱلْقَصَصُ ٱلْحَقُّ وَمَا مِنْ إِلَـٰهٍ إِلاَّ ٱللَّهُ وَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَهُوَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ }
This is the true story. There is no god but God and assuredly God is Mighty Wise. This is the true story: The dust of confusion has no authority over the wit- nessings of divine unity. No delusion of any created being reaches the secret of His ruling ḥukm. Nothing that is known in existence can come close to it and nothing that is imagined can conceive of the divine decree taqdīr.,{ فَإِن تَوَلَّوْاْ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلِيمٌ بِٱلْمُفْسِدِينَ }
And if they turn their backs God knows the agents of corruption. “And if they turn their backs O Muḥammad the confusion of those who talk falsely cannot withstand the rays of your light.” God knows the agents of corruption: either He will sweep them away or He will forbear until their conjectures have become firmly established. Then He will seize them suddenly and [then] they cannot be helped.,{ قُلْ يٰأَهْلَ ٱلْكِتَابِ تَعَالَوْاْ إِلَىٰ كَلِمَةٍ سَوَآءٍ بَيْنَنَا وَبَيْنَكُمْ أَلاَّ نَعْبُدَ إِلاَّ ٱللَّهَ وَلاَ نُشْرِكَ بِهِ شَيْئاً وَلاَ يَتَّخِذَ بَعْضُنَا بَعْضاً أَرْبَاباً مِّن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ فَإِن تَوَلَّوْاْ فَقُولُواْ ٱشْهَدُواْ بِأَنَّا مُسْلِمُونَ }
“O people of the scripture! Come now to a word kalima agreed upon between us and you The word kalima testifies to the divine unity tawḥīd and the singularity ifrād of the Real سبحانه in bringing forth everything. that we worship none but God Do not look in your innermost self to any created thing. There should be no object of worship for you other than Him. You should have no aim maqṣūd or object of witnessing mashhūd other than Him. This is the [best] protection against associating partners [with God] shirk. You yourself are foremost among the “others” that should not be witnessed. and that we do not associate anything with Him and do not take each other for lords beside God”; The truth of this appears in abandoning praise and blame of them remov- ing any complaint or doubt about them and cleansing the innermost self from taking into account even so much as a speck of effacement maḥw or affirmation ithbāt as coming from them. [The Prophet] ﷺ said: The truest verse the Arabs sung was from Labīd: Is not everything other than God unrealḍ Every blessing is inevitably fleeting. and if they turn their backs say “Bear witness that we have submitted.”,{ يٰأَهْلَ ٱلْكِتَابِ لِمَ تُحَآجُّونَ فِيۤ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَمَآ أُنزِلَتِ ٱلتَّورَاةُ وَٱلإنْجِيلُ إِلاَّ مِن بَعْدِهِ أَفَلاَ تَعْقِلُونَ }
“O people of the scripture Why do you argue about Abrahamḍ when the Torah was not revealed neither the Gospel but after him. What do you not comprehendḍ He put a cloak niqāb of possessiveness and a veil ḥijāb of jealousy over His friend عليه السلام and severed his connection to all of them after their accusation about him and [thus he] decisively contradicted their confused arguments. How could Abraham عليه السلام belong to the religion of those who came after himḍ This makes no sense.,{ هٰأَنْتُمْ هَؤُلاۤءِ حَاجَجْتُمْ فِيمَا لَكُم بِهِ عِلمٌ فَلِمَ تُحَآجُّونَ فِيمَا لَيْسَ لَكُمْ بِهِ عِلْمٌ وَٱللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ وَأَنْتُمْ لاَ تَعْلَمُونَ }
Lo! You are those who dispute about what you know; why do you then dispute concerning that of which you have no knowledgeḍ; and God knows and you know not. That is “Your scripture includes clear evidence bayān that should be a proof burhān for you. Regarding that [evidence or proof] you have chosen either truly or falsely. As for that for which you have no defini- tive evidence dalīl or any way of knowing maʿrifa how can you begin to judge it or make claims to have comprehended itḍ”,{ مَا كَانَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ يَهُودِيّاً وَلاَ نَصْرَانِيّاً وَلَكِن كَانَ حَنِيفاً مُّسْلِماً وَمَا كَانَ مِنَ ٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ }
No; Abraham in truth was not a Jew neither a Christian but he was a Muslim and a ḥanīf The ḥanīf is one who stands straight mustaqīm in truth while the aḥnaf stands straight mustaqīm with curved legs-one who leans on a [twisted] foot is called mustaqīm optimistically. Abraham عليه السلام was a ḥanīf not bend- ing from the truth not swerving from the law and not stumbling this way and that with every promise of personal gain. He surrendered his wealth his self his son-everything altogether-to the decree of God and [stood in] a state of readiness for His command. and he was never of the idolators.,{ إِنَّ أَوْلَى ٱلنَّاسِ بِإِبْرَاهِيمَ لَلَّذِينَ ٱتَّبَعُوهُ وَهَـٰذَا ٱلنَّبِيُّ وَٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَٱللَّهُ وَلِيُّ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ }
Surely the people with the best claim Abraham are those who followed him and this Prophet and those who believe; and God is the Protector of the believers. Whereas whims ahwāÌ and blameworthy innovations bidaʿ break up [a group] so that each faction ends up in error the people of truth ahl al-ḥaqq in every era and every time and moment hold to the best proof and will be a single party. They will be those with the best claim [to Abraham] over others. Abraham was a companion of truth ṣāḥib al-ḥaqq. Whoever professes his religion dīn-as in the example of our Messenger ﷺ and his community-belongs to the religion of Abraham عليه السلام which is the declara- tion of the unity tawḥīd of God سبحانه وتعالى. And God is the Protector walī of the believers because they have been entrusted108 with His religion dīn and they act in harmony with the declaration of His unity tawḥīd. The protecting friendship walāya of God comes with aid ʿawn help nuṣra selection takhṣīṣ and nearness qurba.,{ وَدَّت طَّآئِفَةٌ مِّنْ أَهْلِ ٱلْكِتَابِ لَوْ يُضِلُّونَكُمْ وَمَا يُضِلُّونَ إِلاَّ أَنْفُسَهُمْ وَمَا يَشْعُرُونَ }
There is a party of the people of the scripture who yearn to make you go astray; yet they cause none to stray except themselves; but they are not aware. Those who had succumbed to discord who had been afflicted by tribulation and seduced by temptation wished for all people what had befallen them. Although [this party of] the people of the scripture wanted the believers to turn from the truth God refused to do other than perfect His light and sent back upon them the evil consequences of their actions.,{ يٰأَهْلَ ٱلْكِتَابِ لِمَ تَكْفُرُونَ بِآيَاتِ ٱللَّهِ وَأَنْتُمْ تَشْهَدُونَ }
O people of the scripture! Why do you disbelieve in God's verses when you yourselves bear witnessḍ “[You bore witness] before his mission ﷺ to the authenticity of his prophecy. What is it that brings you to error so that you disavow what you knowḍ”,{ يٰأَهْلَ ٱلْكِتَابِ لِمَ تَلْبِسُونَ ٱلْحَقَّ بِٱلْبَاطِلِ وَتَكْتُمُونَ ٱلْحَقَّ وَأَنْتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ }
O people of the scripture! Why do you confound truth with falsehood and conceal the truth while you knowḍ “You conceal the truth regarding the affair of Muḥammad ﷺ while you know that he is the Prophet who speaks truly.” Can this be anything other than the divine ruling to forsake ḥukm al-khidhlān and the decision to deprive qaḌiyyat al-ḥirmān [those who confound and conceal the truth]ḍ Then He informed them that among them there were some hypocrites. They wanted to forestall any trouble with the Muslims while also avoiding conflict with their brothers among the disbelievers. Thus they conspired to pretend to agree publicly with the Messenger ﷺ and the Muslims while secretly to remain true among themselves to their corrupt beliefs.,{ وَقَالَتْ طَّآئِفَةٌ مِّنْ أَهْلِ ٱلْكِتَابِ آمِنُواْ بِٱلَّذِيۤ أُنْزِلَ عَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَجْهَ ٱلنَّهَارِ وَٱكْفُرُوۤاْ آخِرَهُ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ }
A party of the people of scripture say “Believe in what has been revealed to those who believe at the beginning of the day and disbelieve at the end of it so that they might then turn back. [By this verse] God سبحانه showed that their hypocrisy was exposed to the Muslims and that it had not benefited them either in this world because God informed His Prophet عليه السلام and the believers of it or in the hereafter because [their hypocrisy] deprived them of sincere devotion [toward God].,{ وَلاَ تُؤْمِنُوۤاْ إِلاَّ لِمَن تَبِعَ دِينَكُمْ قُلْ إِنَّ ٱلْهُدَىٰ هُدَى ٱللَّهِ أَن يُؤْتَىۤ أَحَدٌ مِّثْلَ مَآ أُوتِيتُمْ أَوْ يُحَآجُّوكُمْ عِندَ رَبِّكُمْ قُلْ إِنَّ ٱلْفَضْلَ بِيَدِ ٱللَّهِ يُؤْتِيهِ مَن يَشَآءُ وَٱللَّهُ وَاسِعٌ عَلِيمٌ }
And do not believe except in one who follows your religion... This may refer to the beginning of a command from God سبحانه to the Muslims. The allusion in it is that you should not associate on intimate terms with opponents nor divulge your secrets to outsiders. Say: “True guidance is God's guidance-that anyone should be given the like of what you have been given or that they should dispute with you before your Lord.” Say: “surely bounty is in God's hand; He is the One who singles out whom He will for the lights of instruction and singles out whom He will for abandonment and deprivation. He gives it to whomever He will; God is Embracing Knowing.,{ يَخْتَصُّ بِرَحْمَتِهِ مَن يَشَآءُ وَاللَّهُ ذُو الْفَضْلِ الْعَظِيمِ }
He singles out for His mercy whom He will; God is of bounty abounding.” He singles out whom He will for different blessings. According to this [way of reading the verse] mercy is a means sabab for the singling out of bless- ing to those He wills to receive it. But the wording is such that it is also possible that it means that He singles out mercy for whom He will-in this case it would mean mercy [itself] not mercy functioning as a means [to something else]. According to this interpretation [His mercy] means prophecy nubuwwa and friendship walāya. Included in His saying “He singles out for His mercy whom He will” that is [included] for His blessing is preservation from error and sin ʿiṣma and all of the allotted good deeds that He singles out for any particular servant. He singles out some people for the blessing of moral qualities akhlāq some for the blessing of riches arzāq some for the blessing of devotional service ʿibāda others for the blessing of spiritual desire irāda others for success in external things others with the gift of an easier life bi-ʿaṬāÌi al-aysār and others for encountering secrets bi-liqāÌi al-asrār. He said “And if you were to count God's blessing you could never reckon it” [14:34 16:18]. It is said that when they heard He singles out for His mercy whom He will they knew that [His mercy] is not related to any means of attain- ment. Rather the command comes by divine origination ibtidāʿ and divine will mashīÌa. It is said that He singles out for His mercy whom He will in [that person's] comprehension of the secrets [God] reveals to him and the different types of information [God] gives to him.,{ وَمِنْ أَهْلِ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ مَنْ إِن تَأْمَنْهُ بِقِنْطَارٍ يُؤَدِّهِ إِلَيْكَ وَمِنْهُمْ مَّنْ إِن تَأْمَنْهُ بِدِينَارٍ لاَّ يُؤَدِّهِ إِلَيْكَ إِلاَّ مَا دُمْتَ عَلَيْهِ قَآئِماً ذٰلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ قَالُواْ لَيْسَ عَلَيْنَا فِي ٱلأُمِّيِّينَ سَبِيلٌ وَيَقُولُونَ عَلَى اللَّهِ ٱلْكَذِبَ وَهُمْ يَعْلَمُونَ }
And of the people of the scriptures is he who if you trust him with a hundredweight he will return it to you; and of them is he who if you trust him with one dinar will not return it to you; unless you keep standing over him. That is because they say “We have no duty toward the Gentiles. They speak falsehood against God while they are aware. He relates that [the people of the scripture] notwithstanding their error and disbelief vary in their moral qualities. All of them have broken the trust amāna of the religion dīn but among them are those who have regard for proper [human] interactions. Even though they interact with sincerity it will not benefit them in receiving reward but it will benefit them in lessening [their] punishment since disbelievers are held accountable in the details of the laws. If in their disbelief they sinned less they will suf- fer less punishment than those who have lost the most even though their punishment will also be in perpetuity. Then He explained that the judgment is not theirs so that when they say “We have no duty toward the Gentiles” the situation is not as they would have it nor will these words benefit them. Rather the judgment belongs to God سبحانه.,{ بَلَىٰ مَنْ أَوْفَىٰ بِعَهْدِهِ وَاتَّقَى فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ يُحِبُّ الْمُتَّقِينَ }
Nay but whoever fulfils his covenant and has fear for truly God loves the God-fearing. Those who hold to the covenant are deserving of being united in friendship honor and the garden. Those who are in error are deserving of aversion ignominy and shame.,{ إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يَشْتَرُونَ بِعَهْدِ ٱللَّهِ وَأَيْمَانِهِمْ ثَمَناً قَلِيلاً أُوْلَـٰئِكَ لاَ خَلاَقَ لَهُمْ فِي ٱلآخِرَةِ وَلاَ يُكَلِّمُهُمُ ٱللَّهُ وَلاَ يَنظُرُ إِلَيْهِمْ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ وَلاَ يُزَكِّيهِمْ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ }
Those that sell God's covenant and their own oaths for a small price there shall be no share for them in the hereafter; and God shall not speak to them nor look upon them on the Day of Resurrection nor will He purify them and theirs will be a painful chastisement. Those who prefer their caprice hawāhum over their final outcome ʿuqbāhum and have given priority to their desires munāhum over har- monious agreement with their Protector mawlāhum will have no share in the hereafter. Because they have chosen to seek pleasure in the present they have lost in the two abodes and they remain apart from the Real. The pleasure they sought in worldly things ḥaẓẓ has brought upon them all kinds of tribulations but they are not aware of what has happened to them: God shall not speak to them nor look upon them on the Day of Resurrection nor will He purify them. Moreover He will cause them to remain in the punishment beyond the count of time.,{ وَإِنَّ مِنْهُمْ لَفَرِيقاً يَلْوُونَ أَلْسِنَتَهُمْ بِٱلْكِتَابِ لِتَحْسَبُوهُ مِنَ ٱلْكِتَابِ وَمَا هُوَ مِنَ الْكِتَابِ وَيَقُولُونَ هُوَ مِنْ عِندِ اللَّهِ وَمَا هُوَ مِنْ عِندِ ٱللَّهِ وَيَقُولُونَ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ ٱلْكَذِبَ وَهُمْ يَعْلَمُونَ }
And there is a group of them who twist their tongues with the Book so that you may suppose it as part of the Book; yet it is not part of the Book; and they say “It is from God” yet it is not from God and they speak falsehood against God while they know. This verse alludes to those who are false in their claims on this path Ṭarīqa. They embellish what they say and let loose their tongues concerning what their hearts have no information or verification about. In this they deceive the foolish ordinary people and novices. They imagine that they have attained realization of what they say. In describing them God most high said so that you might suppose it is as part of the Book; yet it is not part of the Book. In a similar manner the lords of deception and fraud direct their talk to the weak so that the secrets of the people of realities ahl al-ḥaqāÌiq are exposed before them. God most high said and they speak falsehood against God while they know that is they know that they are speaking falsely. Thus the people of falsehood and deception on this way Ṭarīqa speak from hearts qulūb that are ruined and innermost selves asrār that are veiled. We seek refuge in God from deserving wrath.,{ مَا كَانَ لِبَشَرٍ أَن يُؤْتِيهُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ وَٱلْحُكْمَ وَٱلنُّبُوَّةَ ثُمَّ يَقُولَ لِلنَّاسِ كُونُواْ عِبَاداً لِّي مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ وَلَـٰكِن كُونُواْ رَبَّـٰنِيِّينَ بِمَا كُنتُمْ تُعَلِّمُونَ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ وَبِمَا كُنْتُمْ تَدْرُسُونَ }
It belongs not to any mortal that God should give him the Book the judgment prophethood then that he should say to men “Be servants to me instead of God.” Rather “Be masters by virtue of what you know of the Book and in what you study.” That is “It is not a quality of anyone whom We have chosen for prophet- hood or selected for friendship walāya to call created beings to himself or to teach anything affirming himself or his worldly situation because His سبحانه choosing them for prophethood includes protecting them from what is not permissible. To allow that as an attribute of theirs would be incompatible with their state. Rather the messengers and the friends have called created beings to God سبحانه وتعالى and this is the meaning of God most high's words Rather “Be masters” which is to say that He directs them only to be masters rabbāniyyūn to created beings. [The word] rabbānī is related to [the word] “lord” or “master” rabb just as it is said “so and so is bull- necked” raqabānī or “full of life” ḥayyānī and the like. They are those who have knowledge of God who are forbearing for the sake of God and stand firm through God in their annihilation from anything other than God. With their worldly concerns withering away they become immersed in the realities of His existence rather than their sensory percep- tion of their own states. They speak hear and see by means of God and so they are effaced from what is other than God. It is said that the master rabbānī is one who has had the shadow of his lower self nafs lifted from him and he subsists in the shelter of God's سبحانه shadow. It is said the master is one who does not affirm anything other than his Lord as one; he does not acknowledge even in the slightest way any efface- ment or affirmation [in creation] as belonging to anything other than Him or coming from anything other than Him. It is said that the master is he who is obliterated maḥq in His سبحانه existence and effaced maḥw in witnessing Him so the One who stands in for him is other than him and the One who acts on his account is other than him.,{ وَلاَ يَأْمُرَكُمْ أَن تَتَّخِذُواْ ٱلْمَلاَئِكَةَ وَٱلنَّبِيِّيْنَ أَرْبَاباً أَيَأْمُرُكُم بِٱلْكُفْرِ بَعْدَ إِذْ أَنْتُمْ مُّسْلِمُونَ }
He would never order you to take the angels and the prophets as lords. Would He order you to disbelieve after you have submittedḍ That is “do not attribute to them so much as an atom in the establishment of good and evil ithbāt al-khayr wa-l-sharr.” It is said that He is informing you of the boundary of human nature ḥadd al-bashariyya and the truth of lordship ḥaqq al-rubūbiyya. It is said that He orders you to respect tawqīr them with regard to the command and the law sharīʿa but to disdain taḥqīr the worth of cre- ated things in comparison to lordship rubūbiyya. Would He order you to disbelieve after you have submittedḍ “Would He order you to affirm ithbāt created things after bearing witness shuhūd to the Realḍ” It is said: “Would He order you to look to outward appearances ashkāl and to attribute events to simulacra amthāl after the lights of unity tawḥīd have appeared in your innermost selves and after the suns of singular devotion tafrīd have arisen in your heartsḍ”,{ وَإِذْ أَخَذَ ٱللَّهُ مِيثَاقَ ٱلنَّبِيِّيْنَ لَمَآ آتَيْتُكُم مِّن كِتَابٍ وَحِكْمَةٍ ثُمَّ جَآءَكُمْ رَسُولٌ مُّصَدِّقٌ لِّمَا مَعَكُمْ لَتُؤْمِنُنَّ بِهِ وَلَتَنصُرُنَّهُ قَالَ أَأَقْرَرْتُمْ وَأَخَذْتُمْ عَلَىٰ ذٰلِكُمْ إِصْرِي قَالُوۤاْ أَقْرَرْنَا قَالَ فَٱشْهَدُواْ وَأَنَاْ مَعَكُمْ مِّنَ ٱلشَّاهِدِينَ }
And when God made a covenant with the prophets: “What I have given you of the Book and wisdom; then there shall come to you a messenger con- firming what is with you-you shall believe in him and you shall help him.” He said to them “do you affirmḍ And do you take My load on you on that conditionḍ” They said “We affirm.” He said “Then bear witness and I shall be with you among the witnesses.” God made a covenant regarding Muḥammad ﷺ [that was] binding on all the [other] prophets عليه السلام just as He made a covenant with them to agree to His سبحانه lordship. This is the utmost honoring of the Messenger ﷺ since He connected [Muḥammad's] name with His own and affirmed his worth just as He affirmed His own. So [Muḥammad] is singular in rank among all people and [God] has eased the way for all to know His majesty through the miracle that appeared to [Muḥammad].,{ فَمَنْ تَوَلَّىٰ بَعْدَ ذٰلِكَ فَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْفَاسِقُونَ }
Then whoever turns his back after that they are the wicked. This alludes to whoever abandons [the Prophet's] way sunna or wan- ders [away] from following his path Ṭarīqa after the appearance of [the Prophet's] evidence and the clarity of his miracle. They are those whose condition has become corrupted. They have become deserving of wrath because of their denial and the breaking of their attachment to the divine solicitude.,{ أَفَغَيْرَ دِينِ ٱللَّهِ يَبْغُونَ وَلَهُ أَسْلَمَ مَن فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ طَوْعاً وَكَرْهاً وَإِلَيْهِ يُرْجَعُونَ }
What! Do they desire other than God's religion when to Him has sub- mitted whoever is in the heavens and the earth willing or unwillingly and to Him they shall be returnedḍ Anyone who pays attention to what is not real ghayr al-ḥaqīqa or looks to what is other than Him in imagining divinity ilāhiyya is like one who sees a mirage he thinks is water māÌ but when he comes to it he finds only dust habāÌ. The errors of mere suppositions cut one off and confuse; those who descend into them have entered a desolate wadi. To Him has submitted whoever is in the heavens and the earth willingly because of the lights of divine self-disclosure coming down continually to their innermost selves or unwillingly because of the flow of the divine decree overpowering them.,{ قُلْ آمَنَّا بِٱللَّهِ وَمَآ أُنزِلَ عَلَيْنَا وَمَآ أُنزِلَ عَلَىٰ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَإِسْمَاعِيلَ وَإِسْحَاقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ وَٱلأَسْبَاطِ وَمَا أُوتِيَ مُوسَىٰ وَعِيسَىٰ وَٱلنَّبِيُّونَ مِن رَّبِّهِمْ لاَ نُفَرِّقُ بَيْنَ أَحَدٍ مِّنْهُمْ وَنَحْنُ لَهُ مُسْلِمُونَ }
Say: “We believe in God and that which has been revealed to us and that which has been revealed to Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the tribes; and in that which was given to Moses and Jesus and the prophets from their Lord; we make no division between any of them; and to Him we submit.” We believe in God not our lower selves nor our strength or our power. We believe through God in that which has been revealed to us and through God سبحانه we make no division between any of them-not through our own strength choice effort or acquisition. If He had not taught us who He is we would never have known-for otherwise how could we have learned thisḍ,{ وَمَن يَبْتَغِ غَيْرَ ٱلإِسْلاَمِ دِيناً فَلَنْ يُقْبَلَ مِنْهُ وَهُوَ فِي ٱلآخِرَةِ مِنَ ٱلْخَاسِرِينَ }
Whoever desires a religion other than Islam it shall not be accepted from him and in the hereafter he shall be among the losers. Those who make their way without being extinguished under the flow of His decree-their feet will slip in the bottomless ravine of errors. It is said that whoever seeks to gain favor with Him without clinging to [Islam] his loss will be greater than his gain. It is said that whoever is not annihilated from witnessing everything will not reach the One through whom everything is. It is said that whoever does not walk under the banner of MuṣṬafā ﷺ the one who is exalted in his rank sublime in his attributes-nothing not even so much as an atom will be accepted from him.,{ كَيْفَ يَهْدِي ٱللَّهُ قَوْماً كَفَرُواْ بَعْدَ إِيمَانِهِمْ وَشَهِدُوۤاْ أَنَّ ٱلرَّسُولَ حَقٌّ وَجَآءَهُمُ ٱلْبَيِّنَاتُ وَٱللَّهُ لاَ يَهْدِي ٱلْقَوْمَ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ }
How shall God guide a people who have disbelieved after their belief and bore witness that the Messenger is true and after the clear signs had come to themḍ God guides not the evildoing folk. Those whom He made unsuitable for the communion [of lovers] in His prior decree-how shall He draw them near to Him on the carpet of service through His favor nowḍ It is said [with regard to] those whom He made far removed in the pre- eternal decree-when would He bring them nearer to sincerity in [their] actionsḍ God prevails over His affair.,{ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ جَزَآؤُهُمْ أَنَّ عَلَيْهِمْ لَعْنَةَ ٱللَّهِ وَٱلْمَلاۤئِكَةِ وَٱلنَّاسِ أَجْمَعِينَ }
Those-their requital is that there shall rest on them the curse of God and of the angels and of men altogether. Those-their state in the end is the same as it was from His decree in the beginning of their affair. The beginning for them is fate's rejection radd al-qisma [of them] their middle part is being turned away from service al-ṣaddu ʿan al-khidma and then finally [their] outcome is banishment and abasement al-Ṭard wa-l-madhalla.,{ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا لاَ يُخَفَّفُ عَنْهُمُ ٱلْعَذَابُ وَلاَ هُمْ يُنظَرُونَ }
Abiding therein the chastisement shall not be lightened for them and they shall not be reprieved. Abiding in that abasement [their] punishment will not abate for even a moment lā yaftur ʿanhum al-ʿadhāb laḥẓatan nor will the separation be lightened for them for even an hour lā yukhaffafu dūnihim al-firāq sāʿatan.,{ إِلاَّ ٱلَّذِينَ تَابُواْ مِن بَعْدِ ذٰلِكَ وَأَصْلَحُواْ فَإِنَّ الله غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ }
But those who repent thereafter and make amends then truly God is Forgiving Merciful. [Those who repent] are those whom mercy reaches. They were not among the group [distanced by the prior decree] although people imagined them to be part of it.,{ إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ بَعْدَ إِيمَانِهِمْ ثُمَّ ٱزْدَادُواْ كُفْراً لَّن تُقْبَلَ تَوْبَتُهُمْ وَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلضَّآلُّونَ }
Surely those who disbelieve after they have believed and then increase in unbelief their repentance shall not be accepted; those are the ones who go astray. This alludes to those who return to the states of the people of habit ahl al-ʿāda after having traveled the path of spiritual desire Ṭarīq al-irāda. They prefer this world and to submit to their whims over seeking the Real سبحانه وتعالى. Then they renounce the people of the path ahl al-Ṭarīqa and become ever more alone in their [inner] darknesses. Their repentance shall not be accepted; those are the ones who go astray from the path of the Real for trust amāna cannot be regained once treachery khiyāna has been displayed. As the days pass their punishment is the increasing estrange- ment of [their] hearts from the path and they are not distressed by the felicitous state that has slipped away from them. If they had persevered their repentance would have been accepted but the Real سبحانه follows His way sunna with those who are listless on this path when they revert to habitual states aḥwāl al-ʿāda and do not feel regret for the moments that have passed away from them. God most high said “And We shall confound their hearts and eyes; just as they did not believe in it the first time” [6:110]. The apostate from Islam is a more powerful enemy to Muslims than the original disbeliever. Likewise the one who reverts from this path is more powerful in rejecting it and more oppositional to its people than those who were always alien to it.,{ إِنَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَمَاتُواْ وَهُمْ كُفَّارٌ فَلَن يُقْبَلَ مِنْ أَحَدِهِم مِّلْءُ ٱلأَرْضِ ذَهَباً وَلَوِ ٱفْتَدَىٰ بِهِ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ وَمَا لَهُمْ مِّن نَّاصِرِينَ }
Surely those who disbelieve and die disbelieving the whole earth full of gold shall not be accepted from any one of them if he would ransom himself thereby; for them awaits a painful chastisement and they shall have no helpers. This alludes to the one who dies after becoming listless. Even if he had a beautiful beginning he will not be gathered in the hereafter with the people of this story ahl hādhi al-qiṣṣa even if a thousand of those with deeper knowledge were to intercede for him. Indeed the perfection of the ruse with him is that his image will be cast onto someone else in the hereafter so that his acquaintances among the people of deeper knowledge ahl al-maʿrifa will think that it is him but it will not occur to anyone that he should intercede for him.,{ لَن تَنَالُواْ ٱلْبِرَّ حَتَّىٰ تُنْفِقُواْ مِمَّا تُحِبُّونَ وَمَا تُنْفِقُواْ مِن شَيْءٍ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ بِهِ عَلِيمٌ }
You will not attain piety birr until you expend of what mimmā = min mā you love; and whatever thing you expend God knows of it. When the object of seeking is piety and goodness birr [the preposition] min is used which is [the particle of speech] for dividing something into portions. He said “of what mimmā = min mā you love.” Whoever desires piety and goodness birr should expend some portion of what he loves while whoever desires the One who is All-Goodness al-bārr should expend everything he loves. Whoever expends what he loves in this world will find what he seeks from the Real most high. Whoever is attached to the fortunes of the lower self man kāna marbūṬan bi-ḥuẓūẓi nafsihi will not find fortune in nearness to his Lord lam yaḥaẓẓu bi-qurbi rabbihi. It is said that if you can only attain piety and goodness birr by expend- ing what you love how will you ever reach the One who is All-Goodness al-bārr so long as you prefer your worldly fortunes to Himḍ And whatever thing you expend God knows of it. There are those who expend looking for reward and compensation those who expend looking to defend themselves from affliction and tribulations and those who expend content with His knowing. One of them said: He wishes to walk in a weak way so that she might when she hears of his suffering send a message to him. He trembles because of what has become known in seeking the sublime that his qualities might be mentioned one day before Salmā.,{ كُلُّ ٱلطَّعَامِ كَانَ حِـلاًّ لِّبَنِيۤ إِسْرَائِيلَ إِلاَّ مَا حَرَّمَ إِسْرَائِيلُ عَلَىٰ نَفْسِهِ مِن قَبْلِ أَن تُنَزَّلَ ٱلتَّوْرَاةُ قُلْ فَأْتُواْ بِٱلتَّوْرَاةِ فَٱتْلُوهَا إِن كُنتُمْ صَادِقِينَ } * { فَمَنِ ٱفْتَرَىٰ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ ٱلْكَذِبَ مِن بَعْدِ ذَلِكَ فَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلظَّالِمُونَ }
All food was lawful to the children of Israel save what Israel forbade for himself before the Torah was revealed. Say: “Bring the Torah now and recite it if you are truthful.” Whoever invents falsehood against God after that those are the evildoers. [God] does not declare things permissible or prohibited in their original state; in [this state] there is no divine ordinance ḥadd regarding them. That is a liberality and kindness from the Real سبحانه [and this state exists] until such a [time] as a command or a law comes regarding it. God سبحانه has eased the precepts of religious obligation aḥkām al-taklīf for advanced disciples ahl al-nihāya. Their way is to adopt what is easiest in order to perfect what comes to them from the precepts of the hearts aḥkām al-qulūb-surely the difficulties made incumbent on their hearts are harder for them. As for novices ahl al-bidāya the affair is made difficult for them with tasks and litanies-their way is to adopt what is more onerous and difficult [in these areas] so as to empty their hearts of thoughts. Whoever thinks otherwise is in error. This verse also alludes in His saying “Whoever invents falsehood against God” to the states of the people of false claims and errors. They absolve themselves and attribute to God سبحانه their false notions hawājis but God is free of these. It is a rare servant who can distinguish between [true] incoming thoughts khawāṬir and false notions hawājis.,{ كُلُّ ٱلطَّعَامِ كَانَ حِـلاًّ لِّبَنِيۤ إِسْرَائِيلَ إِلاَّ مَا حَرَّمَ إِسْرَائِيلُ عَلَىٰ نَفْسِهِ مِن قَبْلِ أَن تُنَزَّلَ ٱلتَّوْرَاةُ قُلْ فَأْتُواْ بِٱلتَّوْرَاةِ فَٱتْلُوهَا إِن كُنتُمْ صَادِقِينَ } * { فَمَنِ ٱفْتَرَىٰ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ ٱلْكَذِبَ مِن بَعْدِ ذَلِكَ فَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلظَّالِمُونَ }

Say: “God has spoken the truth therefore follow the creed of Abraham a ḥanīf and he was not an idolater.” The creed milla of Abraham was complete abandonment to God al-khurūju ilā Allāh bi-l-kulliya and surrender to His decree without hold- ing back in any way wa-l-taslīmu li-ḥukmihi min ghayri an tabqā baqiyya. In truth to affirm ithbāt anything [other than God] in accounting for what comes into being is idolatry shirk.,{ إِنَّ أَوَّلَ بَيْتٍ وُضِعَ لِلنَّاسِ لَلَّذِي بِبَكَّةَ مُبَارَكاً وَهُدًى لِّلْعَالَمِينَ } * { فِيهِ ءَايَٰتٌ بَيِّنَـٰتٌ مَّقَامُ إِبْرَٰهِيمَ وَمَن دَخَلَهُ كَانَ آمِناً وَللَّهِ عَلَى ٱلنَّاسِ حِجُّ ٱلْبَيْتِ مَنِ ٱسْتَطَاعَ إِلَيْهِ سَبِيلاً وَمَن كَفَرَ فَإِنَّ ٱلله غَنِيٌّ عَنِ ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ }
The first house established for the people was that at Bakka a blessed place and a guidance to all the worlds. Therein are clear signs the station of Abraham; and whoever enters it is secure. It is the duty of people toward God to make the pilgrimage to the House if he is able to make his way there. As for the one who disbelieves God is independent of all the worlds. The House is a bit of stone ḥajara and the servant is a bit of mud madara. The bit of mud is bonded to the bit of stone rabaṬa al-madara bi-l-ḥajara so that mud madar is with stone ḥajar and the One who has always been is magnified and sanctified. It is said that the House is the object of the circumambulation of bodily selves nufūs while the Real سبحانه is the object of the quest of hearts qulūb. The House consists of the remains and traces [of the past]. These are but relics and stones yet These traces of ours point to us. So after we [are gone] look to the traces. It is said that the House is stone but not all stone is alike. [It is] stone but it causes the hearts of the lovers to awaken muzʿij and the souls of the poor fuqarāÌ to leap munfij. Indeed for the hearts of some it is cooling and pleasant muthlij wa-mubhij and for the hearts of others [it is] stimulating and arousing munfij wa-muzʿij. [What people see in the House depends on the] different types [of people]: A House that is a place you go to seek out your loved ones and visit them mazār [or] where you hear news akhbār of them and see the traces āthār [of their having been there]. A House-whoever looks to it with the eye of separation returns with an innermost self laid waste kharāb. Whoever observes it with the eye of connection wins every approach and approval ījāb. As it is said: Truly houses even when they are silent have a pact with Our lovers since they stop at them. A House-whoever visits it with his bodily self finds His kindnesses and whoever visits it with his heart finds His unveilings. It is said that He said “and purify My House” [2:125 and 22:26] attrib- uting it to Himself.,{ إِنَّ أَوَّلَ بَيْتٍ وُضِعَ لِلنَّاسِ لَلَّذِي بِبَكَّةَ مُبَارَكاً وَهُدًى لِّلْعَالَمِينَ } * { فِيهِ ءَايَٰتٌ بَيِّنَـٰتٌ مَّقَامُ إِبْرَٰهِيمَ وَمَن دَخَلَهُ كَانَ آمِناً وَللَّهِ عَلَى ٱلنَّاسِ حِجُّ ٱلْبَيْتِ مَنِ ٱسْتَطَاعَ إِلَيْهِ سَبِيلاً وَمَن كَفَرَ فَإِنَّ ٱلله غَنِيٌّ عَنِ ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ }

It is said that He said “and purify My House” [2:125 and 22:26] attrib- uting it to Himself.,{ قُلْ يٰأَهْلَ ٱلْكِتَابِ لِمَ تَكْفُرُونَ بِآيَاتِ ٱللَّهِ وَٱللَّهُ شَهِيدٌ عَلَى مَا تَعْمَلُونَ }
Say: “O people of the scripture why do you disbelieve in God's verses when God is witness of what you doḍ” The divine address in this verse is meant to confirm the obligation of the pilgrimage [for the people of the scripture]. With respect to the law the pilgrimage is obligatory for them166 but with respect to the true state of affairs ḥaqīqa and [divine] subjugation qahr the pilgrimage is barred to them. They are called by the law and command hum madʿuwūna sharʿan wa-amran but banished by the decree and the subjugation maṬrūdūna ḥukman wa-qahran.,{ قُلْ يٰأَهْلَ ٱلْكِتَابِ لِمَ تَصُدُّونَ عَن سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ مَنْ آمَنَ تَبْغُونَهَا عِوَجاً وَأَنْتُمْ شُهَدَآءُ وَمَا ٱللَّهُ بِغَافِلٍ عَمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ }
Say: “O people of the scripture why do you bar believers from God's way desiring to make it crooked while you yourselves are witnesses. God is not heedless of what you do.” How can one who is barred himself bar anotherḍ Surely in this is a secret belonging to the [divine] Lordship.,{ يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُوۤاْ إِن تُطِيعُواْ فَرِيقاً مِّنَ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ ٱلْكِتَابَ يَرُدُّوكُم بَعْدَ إِيمَانِكُمْ كَافِرِينَ }
O you who believe if you obey a party of those who have been given the scripture they will turn you after you have believed into disbelievers. Estrangement is not restricted to just the estranged but also extends to anyone who becomes part of their circle. Whoever follows the enemy of God into this ruinous companionship will be cast down to the same level.,{ وَكَيْفَ تَكْفُرُونَ وَأَنْتُمْ تُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْكُمْ آيَاتُ ٱللَّهِ وَفِيكُمْ رَسُولُهُ وَمَن يَعْتَصِم بِٱللَّهِ فَقَدْ هُدِيَ إِلَىٰ صِرَاطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ }
How can you disbelieve while you have God's verses recited to you and His Messenger is in your midstḍ Whoever holds fast to God he is guided to a straight path. It is not right that the shade of disbelief should pass over one whose heart [has seen] the rising suns of deeper knowledge ʿirfān. For surely when day comes night slips away. Whoever holds fast to God: The one who holds fast to God has [in truth] only found the holding fast from God. How could those who have not been guided by God hold fast to Godḍ The guidance from Him in the beginning bidāya causes you [to] hold fast in the end nihāya. Your holding fast does not cause the guidance hidāya. The true state of affairs of holding fast is sincerity taking oneself to Him persevering in the flight to Him and continuing to appeal for His help. Whoever has the covering of sepa- ration removed from his innermost self realizes that there is not an atom that belongs to or comes from anything other than God. The people who hold fast to Him are those who are held fast by Him. The leader of those who come first and those who come last ﷺ said “I seek refuge in You from You.” Whoever holds fast to Him through himself -without being effaced from his own strength and power in his holding-his homeland is idolatry shirk but he is unaware.,{ يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ ٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ حَقَّ تُقَاتِهِ وَلاَ تَمُوتُنَّ إِلاَّ وَأَنْتُمْ مُّسْلِمُونَ }
O you who believe fear God as He should be feared ḥaqqa tuqātihi The proper manner ḥaqq of fearing God taqwā is to conform with the command neither more nor less of one's own accord. This is something that has been confirmed by teachings. His command amr has two aspects one of obligation and one of recommendation. Likewise what is said regard- ing prohibition nahy has two parts a forbidding and an abstaining from what is blameworthy. Included in this is the proper manner of fearing Him: [it] is first to avoid error then to avoid negligence then to beware of any omission then to cleanse every defect. When you fear looking to your fear of God taqwā after you have become characterized by it then you will truly fear God as you should fear Him. The proper manner of fearing God is to abandon disobedience ʿiṣyān and to remove forgetfulness nisyān; to uphold contracts ʿuhūd and preserve the limits ḥudūd; to bear witness to the divinity al-ilāhiyya and abandon the precepts of human nature al-bashariyya; to be extinguished under the flow of the decree ḥukm after avoiding every sin and injustice; to feel disdain for seeking to gain access to Him based on anything related to your obedience rather than His pure generosity; and to realize that He does not accept or reject anyone for cause ʿilla. and do not die except as Muslims. Do not let death wafāt overtake you unless you are in a condition of good faith wafāÌ.,{ وَٱعْتَصِمُواْ بِحَبْلِ ٱللَّهِ جَمِيعاً وَلاَ تَفَرَّقُواْ وَٱذْكُرُواْ نِعْمَتَ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ إِذْ كُنْتُمْ أَعْدَآءً فَأَلَّفَ بَيْنَ قُلُوبِكُمْ فَأَصْبَحْتُمْ بِنِعْمَتِهِ إِخْوَاناً وَكُنْتُمْ عَلَىٰ شَفَا حُفْرَةٍ مِّنَ ٱلنَّارِ فَأَنقَذَكُمْ مِّنْهَا كَذٰلِكَ يُبَيِّنُ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمْ آيَاتِهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَهْتَدُونَ }
And hold fast to God's bond together and do not scatter; remember God's grace upon you when you were enemies and He brought your hearts together so that by His grace you became brothers; and you were upon the brink of a pit of fire; but He delivered you from it. So God makes clear to you His signs that you might be guided. Holding fast to His bond سبحانه is clinging to the traces of the intermediary āthār al-wāsiṬa-the noble one ʿazīz ﷺ. This [comes] from confirm- ing what is true and right taḥaqquq and remaining devoted taʿalluq to the Book and the sunna. It is rightly said that [the words] and hold fast to God's bond are spoken to the elite khawāṣṣ while [the words] and hold fast to God [4:146 and 22:78] are spoken to the elect of the elect khāṣṣ al-khāṣṣ. Whoever turns from His auspicious occurrences sawāniḥ back to his own choosing and devising iḥtiyāl his own thinking and reasoning istidlāl his own ways of knowing and behaving ashkāl; and takes refuge in the shade of his own planning tadbīr seeking illumination by the light of his own intel- lect and speculation tafkīr-such a person is denied the shade of divine solicitude and is left with his unfortunate state. And do not scatter: Scattering or separation tafriqa is the most intense punishment. It is the companion to associating others with God shirk. And remember God's grace upon you when you were enemies: They were enemies when they remained with their worldly concerns turning toward the narrowness of human nature and competing with one another as befits the stinginess of [their] lower selves. And He brought your hearts together through deliverance from the cap- tivity of created things. He drove away afflictions from their innermost selves. Then what they sought together became one thing. If a thousand people were to be brought together in one pursuit they would in truth be one. So that by His grace you became brothers: His grace is His safeguard- ing ʿiṣma of you as brothers united in aim and aspiration annihilated from the worldly concerns of the lower self and the furtive impulses of stinginess and avarice. And you were upon the brink of a pit of fire by your being held captive to the objects of your desire munākum and [being] bound by the shackles of your worldly concerns and whims hawākum.,{ وَلْتَكُن مِّنْكُمْ أُمَّةٌ يَدْعُونَ إِلَى ٱلْخَيْرِ وَيَأْمُرُونَ بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ وَيَنْهَوْنَ عَنِ ٱلْمُنْكَرِ وَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْمُفْلِحُونَ }
Let there be one community of you calling to good and enjoining decency and forbidding indecency; those are the successful. This is an allusion to groups of people who have remained with God for God. No blame of any blamer reaches them and no reliance on any cause ʿilla cuts them off from God. All of them have sought awareness of the indicators dalālāt of His command have restrained their lower selves and have devoted their lives to seeking His good pleasure. They have worked for God have been sincere and faithful to the religion dīn of God and have called the created beings of God to God. So their trade is profitable and their dealings produce no loss.,{ وَلاَ تَكُونُواْ كَٱلَّذِينَ تَفَرَّقُواْ وَٱخْتَلَفُواْ مِن بَعْدِ مَا جَآءَهُمُ ٱلْبَيِّنَاتُ وَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ عَظِيمٌ }
Be not as those who scattered and disputed after the clear proofs came to them those will have a mighty chastisement. He showed these groups of people the marks of seeking in the beginning ibtidāʿ but then branded them with the burning of separation in the end intihāÌ. They passed the night with the party of lovers and then awoke with the group of outsiders.,{ يَوْمَ تَبْيَضُّ وُجُوهٌ وَتَسْوَدُّ وُجُوهٌ فَأَمَّا ٱلَّذِينَ ٱسْوَدَّتْ وُجُوهُهُمْ أَكْفَرْتُمْ بَعْدَ إِيمَانِكُمْ فَذُوقُواْ ٱلْعَذَابَ بِمَا كُنْتُمْ تَكْفُرُونَ } * { وَأَمَّا ٱلَّذِينَ ٱبْيَضَّتْ وُجُوهُهُمْ فَفِي رَحْمَةِ ٱللَّهِ هُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ }
The day when some faces are blackened and some faces whitened. As for those whose faces are blackened “did you disbelieve after you had believedḍ Then taste the chastisement for what you disbelieved!” But for those whose faces are whitened they shall be in God's mercy abiding therein. The faces of the lords of pretensions daʿāwā will be blackened while the faces of the companions of meanings maʿānī will be whitened. The faces of the people of unveilings kushūfāt will be whitened through illumina- tion. The faces of the companions of the veil ḥijāb will be blackened with shame covered with dust taʿlūhā ghabara and overcast with gloom wa-tarhaquhā qatara. It is said that whoever's heart is white today his face will be white in the future and the one who is the opposite his situation will be the reverse. It is said that whoever turns away from created beings before His auspi- cious occurrences sawāniḥ his face will become white with the spirit of having committed his affairs [to God] rūḥ al-tafwīḌ. Whoever's heart is attached to what is other [than God] with wants and needs ḥawāÌij his heart will become black [and] his face [will be] in the dust of covetousness. As for those whose faces have become white they will be in intimacy and ease rawḥ. As for those whose faces have become blackened they will [experience] tribulations and lamentation nawḥ.,{ يَوْمَ تَبْيَضُّ وُجُوهٌ وَتَسْوَدُّ وُجُوهٌ فَأَمَّا ٱلَّذِينَ ٱسْوَدَّتْ وُجُوهُهُمْ أَكْفَرْتُمْ بَعْدَ إِيمَانِكُمْ فَذُوقُواْ ٱلْعَذَابَ بِمَا كُنْتُمْ تَكْفُرُونَ } * { وَأَمَّا ٱلَّذِينَ ٱبْيَضَّتْ وُجُوهُهُمْ فَفِي رَحْمَةِ ٱللَّهِ هُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ }

You are the best community khayra ummatin brought forth to men enjoining decency and forbidding indecency and believing in God. Because MuṣṬafā ﷺ is the most honored of the prophets his community is the best of communities. Because they are the best of communities they are the most desiring ashwāq of communities. Because they are the most desiring of communities their lives are the shortest of lives. He created them as the last of created beings so that their stay beneath the earth would not be long [before the resurrection]. Their goodness khayriyya has been obtained not by the abundance of their prayers and devotional acts but by the intensity with which He has drawn them near and selected them. Surely the standing of the earlier ones at the door has been long but when the permission comes to enter the later ones will go first. How many reach out to connect to us [yet] their palms receive no share. Enjoining decency and forbidding indecency: Decency is service to the Real and indecency is keeping company with the lower self. Decency is to prefer what is due to the Real ḥaqq al-ḥaqq and inde- cency is to choose the worldly concerns of the lower self ḥaẓẓ al-nafs. Decency is what brings you close to Him and indecency is what veils you from Him. In the command to decency you are bound to be characterized by decency and in forbidding indecency you are required to turn away from it. Had the people of the scripture believed it would have been better for them; some of them are believers; but most of them are wicked. If everyone had been included under Our command they would have attained true glory in this world and the hereafter but they were kept away from acceptance in the choice already made-most of them were branded with associating partners with God shirk.,{ لَن يَضُرُّوكُمْ إِلاَّ أَذًى وَإِن يُقَاتِلُوكُمْ يُوَلُّوكُمُ ٱلأَدْبَارَ ثُمَّ لاَ يُنصَرُونَ }
They will not harm you except a little hurt; and if they fight against you they will turn their backs to you then they will not be helped. The Real سبحانه وتعالى does not give His enemies power over His friends except as much as will prove the sincerity of the flight [of the friends] to God for the reality of their flight firār is nobler before Him than their staying firm qarār. If [the enemies] imagine themselves to be superior to the friends in truth they suffer lowliness and degradation.,{ ضُرِبَتْ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلذِّلَّةُ أَيْنَ مَا ثُقِفُوۤاْ إِلاَّ بِحَبْلٍ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَحَبْلٍ مِّنَ ٱلنَّاسِ وَبَآءُوا بِغَضَبٍ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَضُرِبَتْ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلْمَسْكَنَةُ ذٰلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ يَكْفُرُونَ بِآيَاتِ ٱللَّهِ وَيَقْتُلُونَ ٱلأَنْبِيَآءَ بِغَيْرِ حَقٍّ ذٰلِكَ بِمَا عَصَوْاْ وَّكَانُواْ يَعْتَدُونَ }
Abasement shall be cast upon them wherever they are found save a rope of God and a rope of the people; they have incurred anger from God and poverty shall be cast upon them; that because they disbelieved in God's signs and slew the prophets without right; that because they disobeyed and used to transgress. The sign of being exiled cannot be hidden the mark of distance cannot be concealed and the evidence of being cut off cannot be veiled. They are in the lowly state of having been banished and abased by rejection. Those who have eyes ulū l-abṣar learn from them while those among the dis- believers and the profligates al-kuffār al-fujjār who are of their kind are deceived by them.,{ لَيْسُواْ سَوَآءً مِّنْ أَهْلِ ٱلْكِتَابِ أُمَّةٌ قَآئِمَةٌ يَتْلُونَ آيَاتِ ٱللَّهِ آنَآءَ ٱللَّيْلِ وَهُمْ يَسْجُدُونَ } * { يُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلآخِرِ وَيَأْمُرُونَ بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ وَيَنْهَوْنَ عَنِ ٱلْمُنْكَرِ وَيُسَارِعُونَ فِي ٱلْخَيْرَاتِ وَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ مِنَ ٱلصَّالِحِينَ }
Yet they are not all alike; some of the people of the scripture are a community upright who recite God's verses in the watches of the night pros- trating themselves. They believe in God and in the Last Day enjoining decency and for- bidding indecency vying with one another in good works; those are of the righteous. Just as the difference between light and darkness is one of contradiction it has likewise been established that the states of the friends and the states of the enemies are mutually exclusive. How can illumination and darkness ẓulma certainty and suspicion tuhma communion and separation furqa distance and intimacy ulfa devotion on the carpet and turning from the door being characterized by friendship walāÌ and departing from fidelity wafāÌ be considered equalḍ How can the two possibly come togetherḍ How can they be compatible or equalḍ,{ لَيْسُواْ سَوَآءً مِّنْ أَهْلِ ٱلْكِتَابِ أُمَّةٌ قَآئِمَةٌ يَتْلُونَ آيَاتِ ٱللَّهِ آنَآءَ ٱللَّيْلِ وَهُمْ يَسْجُدُونَ } * { يُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلآخِرِ وَيَأْمُرُونَ بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ وَيَنْهَوْنَ عَنِ ٱلْمُنْكَرِ وَيُسَارِعُونَ فِي ٱلْخَيْرَاتِ وَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ مِنَ ٱلصَّالِحِينَ }

And whatever good they do they shall not be denied it and God knows the God-fearing. One who is intent shall not be debarred from His door; one who does busi- ness shall not suffer loss on His account; one who desires companionship shall not be lonely with Him; and one who seeks shall not be contemptible before Him.,{ إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لَنْ تُغْنِيَ عَنْهُمْ أَمْوَالُهُمْ وَلاَ أَوْلاَدُهُمْ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ شَيْئاً وَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ أَصْحَابُ ٱلنَّارِ هُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ }
As for the disbelievers their riches shall not avail them neither their children against God; those are the inhabitants of the fire abiding therein. There is no alternate for them in the situation no substitute for them in the final outcome. They are in a state of loss in the here and now and in the future will be in separation and exile affliction and hurt punishment and rejection: She changed and we changed. Alas to anyone who has sought but did not find a replacement to let him forget.,{ مَثَلُ مَا يُنْفِقُونَ فِي هَـٰذِهِ ٱلْحَيَاةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا كَمَثَلِ رِيحٍ فِيهَا صِرٌّ أَصَابَتْ حَرْثَ قَوْمٍ ظَلَمُوۤاْ أَنْفُسَهُمْ فَأَهْلَكَتْهُ وَمَا ظَلَمَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ وَلَـٰكِنْ أَنْفُسَهُمْ يَظْلِمُونَ }
The likeness of what they expend in the life of this world is as the likeness of a wind wherein is a blast that smote the tillage of a people who have wronged themselves and destroyed it. God did not wrong them but they wronged themselves. They found no inheritance for what they spent for other than God except continuous affliction. They obtained nothing from their calculations except one tribulation after another. That is the recompense of those who reject and turn their backs.,{ يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ لاَ تَتَّخِذُواْ بِطَانَةً مِّن دُونِكُمْ لاَ يَأْلُونَكُمْ خَبَالاً وَدُّواْ مَا عَنِتُّمْ قَدْ بَدَتِ ٱلْبَغْضَآءُ مِنْ أَفْوَاهِهِمْ وَمَا تُخْفِي صُدُورُهُمْ أَكْبَرُ قَدْ بَيَّنَّا لَكُمُ الآيَاتِ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ }
O you who believe do not take as intimates anyone apart from your- selves; such men spare nothing to ruin you; they would love for you to suffer. Hatred is revealed by their mouths; and what their breasts conceal is yet greater. Now We have made clear to you the signs; if you understand. To trust the adversary after difficulties have become apparent is to further facilitate the deception of the enemy. The Real سبحانه advised the Muslims to be wary of the opposition to declare themselves free of anyone other [than Him] and to continually persist in their devotion to the Real سبحانه in the heart and innermost self. He stated that from the beginning it was not unexpected that [there would be] opponents of the Messenger ﷺ among the people. How could it not be so when [Muḥammad] ﷺ [was] drawn near and they [were] turned awayḍ How can night be combined with dayḍ,{ هَآأَنْتُمْ أُوْلاۤءِ تُحِبُّونَهُمْ وَلاَ يُحِبُّونَكُمْ وَتُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱلْكِتَابِ كُلِّهِ وَإِذَا لَقُوكُمْ قَالُوۤاْ آمَنَّا وَإِذَا خَلَوْاْ عَضُّواْ عَلَيْكُمُ ٱلأَنَامِلَ مِنَ ٱلْغَيْظِ قُلْ مُوتُواْ بِغَيْظِكُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلِيمٌ بِذَاتِ ٱلصُّدُورِ }
Lo there you are you love them but they love you not; you believe in the Book all of it and when they meet you they say “We believe” but when they are alone they bite their fingertips at you in rage. “Your hearts in the matter of your magnanimity are clear of impurities so sympathy predominates in you for them. But they in their ferocious recal- citrance and antagonism deceive you in what they are capable of doing. Because of their savageness you will not receive a drop of anything from them but their rage so free your heart of them O Muḥammad.” Say: “Perish in your rage. God knows what is in the breasts.” “Leave them alone in suffering the rage that is mixed up inside them and find peace in your hearts [in relation] to what has happened to them for God is nearer to His servants; He bestows what He will on whom He will.”,{ إِن تَمْسَسْكُمْ حَسَنَةٌ تَسُؤْهُمْ وَإِن تُصِبْكُمْ سَيِّئَةٌ يَفْرَحُواْ بِهَا وَإِن تَصْبِرُواْ وَتَتَّقُواْ لاَ يَضُرُّكُمْ كَيْدُهُمْ شَيْئاً إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ بِمَا يَعْمَلُونَ مُحِيطٌ }
If good fortune befalls you it is evil for them; but if evil befalls you they rejoice thereat. Yet if you endure and fear [God] their guile will not hurt you at all; God encompasses what they do. This verse alludes to those who abandon the path of spiritual desire irāda and return to the states of the people of habit ahl al-ʿāda. They are not happy to see an aspirant murīd have a breakthrough nafādh; rather they are glad when they see listlessness in a seeker qāṣid. God in His favor and grace perfects His light for the people of His solicitude and He lets the evildoers stray from His path and their distance is punishment. He is not concerned with what comes to them.,{ وَإِذْ غَدَوْتَ مِنْ أَهْلِكَ تُبَوِّىءُ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ مَقَاعِدَ لِلْقِتَالِ وَٱللَّهُ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ }
you went forth at dawn from your family to assign the believers their places for battle and God hears knows. He put [the Prophet] ﷺ in charge of assigning the places for battle del- egating His command to him. Then He made manifest in this matter the hidden things of His secret. The axis revolves around His determination and decree fa-l-madār ʿalā qaḌāÌihi wa-qadarihi and the crossing over is by means of what He brings about and chooses wa-l-iʿtibār bi-ijrāÌihi wa-ikhtiyārihi.,{ إِذْ هَمَّتْ طَّآئِفَتَانِ مِنكُمْ أَن تَفْشَلاَ وَٱللَّهُ وَلِيُّهُمَا وَعَلَى ٱللَّهِ فَلْيَتَوَكَّلِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ }
parties of you were about to lose heart; and God was their protector and let the believers rely on God. He brings forth everyone in the vest of free choice ikhtiyār as if their negation and affirmation their acts and abstention from acting were at their [own] command. In truth they are only turned about by the agency of His grasp taṣrīf al-qabḌa and the turning of His deliberative power taqlīb al-qudra.,{ وَلَقَدْ نَصَرَكُمُ ٱللَّهُ بِبَدْرٍ وَأَنْتُمْ أَذِلَّةٌ فَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ }
gave you victory at Badr when you were contemptible. So fear God in order that you might be thankful. The reminder of favors granted in the past is an opening to the door of supplication to ask for similar things in the future.,{ إِذْ تَقُولُ لِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ أَلَنْ يَكْفِيكُمْ أَن يُمِدَّكُمْ رَبُّكُمْ بِثَلاَثَةِ ءَالَٰفٍ مِّنَ ٱلْمَلاۤئِكَةِ مُنزَلِينَ } * { بَلَىۤ إِن تَصْبِرُواْ وَتَتَّقُواْ وَيَأْتُوكُمْ مِّن فَوْرِهِمْ هَـٰذَا يُمْدِدْكُمْ رَبُّكُمْ بِخَمْسَةِ ءَالَٰفٍ مِّنَ ٱلْمَلاۤئِكَةِ مُسَوِّمِينَ }
were saying to the believers “Is it not sufficient for you that your Lord should reinforce you with three thousand angels sent downḍ Yea if you are patient and fear and they come against you instantly your Lord will reinforce you with five thousand angels accoutred.” The tranquility sent by the Real سبحانه to the heart of MuṣṬafā ﷺ was from God سبحانه without intermediary while the strengthening of the hearts of the believers was through the intermediary of the Messenger ﷺ. If not for [the doubt that] remained in them he would not have replied to them telling [them] of the help [that would] be sent in the angel malak. Why tell of the angel when the affair is entirely in the hand of the King malikḍ,{ إِذْ تَقُولُ لِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ أَلَنْ يَكْفِيكُمْ أَن يُمِدَّكُمْ رَبُّكُمْ بِثَلاَثَةِ ءَالَٰفٍ مِّنَ ٱلْمَلاۤئِكَةِ مُنزَلِينَ } * { بَلَىۤ إِن تَصْبِرُواْ وَتَتَّقُواْ وَيَأْتُوكُمْ مِّن فَوْرِهِمْ هَـٰذَا يُمْدِدْكُمْ رَبُّكُمْ بِخَمْسَةِ ءَالَٰفٍ مِّنَ ٱلْمَلاۤئِكَةِ مُسَوِّمِينَ }

What God ordained was only as a good tiding to you and that your hearts might be at peace. Victory comes only from God the Mighty the Wise. God سبحانه follows His practice sunna with His friends is such a way that when their intentions niyyāt become weak their spiritual desire irāda low or their hearts are on the verge of listlessness fatra He shows them kindnesses alṬāf and special gifts karāmāt. By these the ties of their deeper knowledge ʿirfān are strengthened and the realities of their cer- tainty yaqīn are confirmed. He sent down this address according to this practice sunna. Then He severed their hearts and innermost selves from anything other than Him entirely saying Victory comes only from God.,{ لِيَقْطَعَ طَرَفاً مِّنَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوۤاْ أَوْ يَكْبِتَهُمْ فَيَنقَلِبُواْ خَآئِبِينَ }
And that He might cut off a party of the disbelievers or suppress them so that they fall back frustrated. God does not let enemies gloat over the misfortunes of His friends. Even if the believer is struck by a catastrophic defeat nakba there is no doubt that God will cause His enemy to suffer trial and punishment.,{ لَيْسَ لَكَ مِنَ ٱلأَمْرِ شَيْءٌ أَوْ يَتُوبَ عَلَيْهِمْ أَوْ يُعَذِّبَهُمْ فَإِنَّهُمْ ظَالِمُونَ } * { وَللَّهِ مَا فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِي ٱلأَرْضِ يَغْفِرُ لِمَن يَشَآءُ وَيُعَذِّبُ مَن يَشَآءُ وَٱللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ }
it is no concern at all of yours whether He relents to them or chastises them; for they are indeed evildoers. To God belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth; He forgives whom He wills and chastises whom He wills. And God is Forgiving Merciful. The deity is the One to whom belongs the command and the prohibition. Because there is no counterpart to Him in divinity [the Prophet] ﷺ has nothing to do with the command and the prohibition. It is said that in what He taught him and told him He divested [the Prophet] of everything else and every share or claim inasmuch as He stated that the command was in no way his. If no part of the command is permit- ted for the leader of the first and the last how can there be any part of the command for the one whose rank is lower in stationḍ It is said that He takes for Himself alone the secret of His servants in His decree ḥukm saying “I am the One who relents to whom I will among My servants and I punish whom I will. What happens in the end is hidden from you O Muḥammad and you are not aware of My secret regarding them.” It is said that He raised [the Prophet] up at one time to a station in which He said “and you threw not when you threw but God threw” [8:17]. [The Prophet] threw a handful of earth and hit all the faces [of the enemy]. But in another time He said to him “No part of the command is yours” [3:128] and then added in explanation “To God belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth” [3:129]. Therefore the right to possess is His right to pos- sess mulk the command is His command amr and the decree is His decree ḥukm. He punishes whom He will fa-man shāÌa ʿadhdhabahu and brings closer [to Him] whom He will wa-man shāÌa qarrabahu. He guides whom He will wa-man shāÌa hadāhu and leads astray whom He will wa-man shāÌa aghwāhu.,{ لَيْسَ لَكَ مِنَ ٱلأَمْرِ شَيْءٌ أَوْ يَتُوبَ عَلَيْهِمْ أَوْ يُعَذِّبَهُمْ فَإِنَّهُمْ ظَالِمُونَ } * { وَللَّهِ مَا فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِي ٱلأَرْضِ يَغْفِرُ لِمَن يَشَآءُ وَيُعَذِّبُ مَن يَشَآءُ وَٱللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ }

O you who believe do not exact usury doubled and redoubled. And fear God so that you may prosper. And fear the fire that has been prepared for the disbelievers. [God] has prohibited usury for His servants; this includes loaning one amount and asking twice as much in return. But He has asked you for a loan which He will repay seven hundredfold even up to an infinite repay- ment.This alludes to the magnanimity karam that is not inherent in humans but rather is an attribute of the Real سبحانه. And fear the fire that has been prepared for the disbelievers: These words indicate that the believer will not be chastised by [the fire]. If he is chastised by it for a time he will not abide in it.,{ يَٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ لاَ تَأْكُلُواْ ٱلرِّبَٰواْ أَضْعَٰفاً مُّضَٰعَفَةً وَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ } * { وَٱتَّقُواْ ٱلنَّارَ ٱلَّتِيۤ أُعِدَّتْ لِلْكَافِرِينَ }

And obey God and the Messenger so that you may find mercy. [God] tied obedience to the Messenger ﷺ to obedience to Himself. This was to elevate [the Prophet's] rank and to make things easier for the com- munity by handing them over to the company of an individual who was one of them. It is more reassuring to be with one's own kind.,{ وَسَارِعُوۤاْ إِلَىٰ مَغْفِرَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَجَنَّةٍ عَرْضُهَا ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتُ وَٱلأَرْضُ أُعِدَّتْ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ } * { ٱلَّذِينَ يُنفِقُونَ فِي السَّرَّآءِ وَٱلضَّرَّآءِ وَٱلْكَاظِمِينَ ٱلْغَيْظَ وَٱلْعَافِينَ عَنِ ٱلنَّاسِ وَٱللَّهُ يُحِبُّ ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ }
And vie with one another hastening to forgiveness from your Lord and to a garden as wide as the heavens and the earth that has been prepared for those who fear. Who expend in prosperity and adversity and restrain their rage and pardon their fellow men; and God loves those who are virtuous. The meaning here is vie with one another hastening to act in ways that will bring about forgiveness for you. The hearts [of the believers] were overwhelmed imagining that this was a difficult matter so [the Prophet] ﷺ said “Remorse is repentance” al-nadmu tawba. Nothing but repentance brings about forgiveness because the one who disobeys is the one who is in need of it. The people who vie with one another are of several types. Those who are worshipers ʿābidūn vie with one another by their feet in acts of obedience bi-qadamihim fī l-Ṭāʿāt. Those who have deeper knowledge ʿārifūn vie with one another with their aspirations in acts of drawing near bi-himam- ihim fī l-qurubāt. Those who are disobedient ʿāṣūn vie with one another with their remorse by swallowing their grief bi-nadamihim bi-tajarruʿi al-ḥasarāt. Whoever vies with others by his feet finds [God's] recompense wajada mathwabatahu. Whoever vies with others with his aspirations finds [God's] nearness wajada qurbatahu. Whoever vies with others with his remorse finds [God's] mercy wajada raḥmatahu. When He mentioned the garden He described it by the vastness of its width and in that there is information about its height because the height is comparable to the width. But when He mentioned forgiveness he did not mention height or width so some people have said that forgiveness is from the [divine] attributes of the essence ṣifāt al-dhāt and is part of the meaning of mercy raḥma. According to this way of thinking His forgiveness is His decree ḥukm in overlooking [the misdeeds of] the servant and His speech kalām. The quality of the essence is too holy for size and width. [On the other hand] those who say His forgiveness belongs with the [divine] attributes of actions ṣifāt al-fiʿl say that because of the abundance of sins He did not describe forgiveness as having any end thus indicating that it encompasses all sins. Who expend in prosperity and adversity: They do not hoard anything from God and prefer Him over everything.,{ وَسَارِعُوۤاْ إِلَىٰ مَغْفِرَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَجَنَّةٍ عَرْضُهَا ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتُ وَٱلأَرْضُ أُعِدَّتْ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ } * { ٱلَّذِينَ يُنفِقُونَ فِي السَّرَّآءِ وَٱلضَّرَّآءِ وَٱلْكَاظِمِينَ ٱلْغَيْظَ وَٱلْعَافِينَ عَنِ ٱلنَّاسِ وَٱللَّهُ يُحِبُّ ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ }

And who when they commit an indecency or wrong themselves remem- ber God and pray forgiveness for their sins-and who shall forgive sins but Godḍ-and who do not persist in what they did knowing. Those-their requital is forgiveness from their Lord and gardens beneath which rivers flow abiding therein; excellent is the wage of those workers!

The transgres- sions mukhālafāt that occur in the minds of the most respected people are like the actions of others. Their speaker said: You are my eye.

It is said that they commit an indecency by relying on their [own] actions or they wrong themselves by regarding their [own] states so they seek forgiveness for their sins by declaring themselves free from what they do and do not do knowing that there are no means to Him except through Him. He has purified them of the wrongdoings of their bodily and lower selves. Looking to states and actions when realities appear is wrongdoing. One whom God has purified by the light of solicitude is protected from entanglement in the delusions of people. Those-their requital is forgiveness from their Lord in returning them to witnessing the Lordship and the best possible outcome and fate that was already theirs. And gardens beneath which rivers flow in the future in paradise and in the here and now in the happiness of whispered conversations and the fullness of intimacy.,{ وَٱلَّذِينَ إِذَا فَعَلُواْ فَاحِشَةً أَوْ ظَلَمُوۤاْ أَنْفُسَهُمْ ذَكَرُواْ ٱللَّهَ فَٱسْتَغْفَرُواْ لِذُنُوبِهِمْ وَمَن يَغْفِرُ ٱلذُّنُوبَ إِلاَّ ٱللَّهُ وَلَمْ يُصِرُّواْ عَلَىٰ مَا فَعَلُواْ وَهُمْ يَعْلَمُونَ } * { أُوْلَـٰئِكَ جَزَآؤُهُمْ مَّغْفِرَةٌ مِّن رَّبِّهِمْ وَجَنَّاتٌ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلأَنْهَارُ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا وَنِعْمَ أَجْرُ ٱلْعَامِلِينَ }

Faint not neither grieve for you shall prevail if you are believers. [This] means when you support or launch an attack by means of [the help of] God you should not be afraid of anything other than God. Nor should you faint or become weak for surely help is from God and the One who prevails is God. Nothing is equal to God. Not even an atom or a particle [originates] from them. His words if you are believers that is it is not right that the believer should be overshadowed by fear of anything other than God.,{ إِن يَمْسَسْكُمْ قَرْحٌ فَقَدْ مَسَّ ٱلْقَوْمَ قَرْحٌ مِّثْلُهُ وَتِلْكَ ٱلأَيَّامُ نُدَاوِلُهَا بَيْنَ ٱلنَّاسِ وَلِيَعْلَمَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَيَتَّخِذَ مِنكُمْ شُهَدَآءَ وَٱللَّهُ لاَ يُحِبُّ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ }
If a wound touches you a like wound already has touched the other people. Such days We deal out in turn among mankind and that God may know those who believe; and that He may take witnesses from among you and God loves not the evildoers. “If a difficulty has come to you for Our sake they have faced something similar before you. They have been given something like what you have been given.” Those who are patient among them will be victorious fa-man ṣabara minhum ẓafira while those who suffer what comes with annoyance and anger will lose wa man Ḍajira min ḥamli ma laqiya khasira. Days come in turns al-ayām nuwabun and circumstances change wa-l-ḥālāt duwalun and nothing is hidden from the Real.,{ وَلِيُمَحِّصَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَيَمْحَقَ ٱلْكَافِرِينَ }
And that God may prove the believers and efface the disbelievers. The tests of the unseen are a kind of smelting for the servant. Through various stages He purifies him from faults so that he becomes like pure gold without any dross. In this way one becomes clear of defects and purified for God. And efface the disbelievers in the wadis of dispersion tafriqa. As for the scum it passes away as dross [13:17].,{ أَمْ حَسِبْتُمْ أَن تَدْخُلُواْ ٱلْجَنَّةَ وَلَمَّا يَعْلَمِ ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِينَ جَاهَدُواْ مِنكُمْ وَيَعْلَمَ ٱلصَّابِرِينَ }
Or did you suppose that you should enter paradise without God know- ing who among you have struggled and who are patient. The wish of those who think they can arrive at a greatly esteemed place without enduring hardships casts them into the abyss of destruction. On the other hand those who recognize the value of [the place] that is sought will have the exertion of their pains made easy for them: Time is not generous with its pleasures for those who are reluctant to throw off restraints. Their speaker said: When youth is on the lookout for the lightning of meanings al-maʿānī the least valuable use of time is the pleasantry of sleep.,{ وَلَقَدْ كُنْتُمْ تَمَنَّوْنَ ٱلْمَوْتَ مِن قَبْلِ أَن تَلْقَوْهُ فَقَدْ رَأَيْتُمُوهُ وَأَنْتُمْ تَنظُرُونَ }
You were longing for death before you met it. Now you have seen it looking on. The pangs of longing come after being patient in enduring difficulties yet When tears flow down cheeks The one who is crying is distinguished from the one who is only pretending.,{ وَمَا مُحَمَّدٌ إِلاَّ رَسُولٌ قَدْ خَلَتْ مِن قَبْلِهِ ٱلرُّسُلُ أَفإِنْ مَّاتَ أَوْ قُتِلَ ٱنْقَلَبْتُمْ عَلَىٰ أَعْقَابِكُمْ وَمَن يَنقَلِبْ عَلَىٰ عَقِبَيْهِ فَلَن يَضُرَّ ٱللَّهَ شَيْئاً وَسَيَجْزِي ٱللَّهُ ٱلشَّاكِرِينَ }
Muḥammad is only a messenger: messengers have passed away before him. Why if he should die or is slain will you turn back on your heels. If any man should turn back on his heels he will not harm God in any way and God will requite those that are thankful. The messengers were stationed wherever they were made to stand and they spoke of what they had been told so far as they knew. When they were aided by the lights of insights they came to know the hidden things of the innermost self to the degree that they were given illumination through the subtleties of allusion. Why if he should die or is slain will you turn back on your heels: When MuṣṬafā ﷺ passed away the eyes of discernment of all became weak except those of [Abū Bakr] al-ṣiddīq رضي الله عنه. God aided him with the power of the spirit of peace sakīna and inspired him with the power of gov- ernorship al-tawallī. [Abū Bakr] said “Whoever worships Muḥammad Muḥammad has died.” Everyone was subdued by the authority of his words because the light of his state spread to them just as the sun by its rising incorporates the light of the stars in its rays. The less intense rays of the stars are concealed by [the sun's rays]. He said Why if he should die or is slain because [the Prophet] ﷺ was slain. [The Prophet] said “The meal of Khaybar comes to me yet again but this time it has cut my aorta.”,{ وَمَا كَانَ لِنَفْسٍ أَنْ تَمُوتَ إِلاَّ بِإِذْنِ ٱللهِ كِتَٰباً مُّؤَجَّلاً وَمَن يُرِدْ ثَوَابَ ٱلدُّنْيَا نُؤْتِهِ مِنْهَا وَمَن يُرِدْ ثَوَابَ ٱلآخِرَةِ نُؤْتِهِ مِنْهَا وَسَنَجْزِي ٱلشَّٰكِرِينَ }
It is not for any soul to die save by the leave of God a prescribed term. And whoever desires the reward of this world We will give him of it; and whoever desires the reward of the hereafter We will give him of it; and We will requite the thankful. The breaths have a set duration for which there is no increase or decrease. And whoever desires the reward of this world We will give him of it: The righteous have what comes in the end ʿāqiba and the others have heedlessness ghafla. And whoever desires the reward of the hereafter We will give him of it: The reward of the hereafter is first of all forgiveness ghufrān then the gardens jinān then beatitude riḌwān. And We will requite the thankful: The requital for thankfulness is thankfulness.,{ وَكَأَيِّن مِّن نَّبِيٍّ قَاتَلَ مَعَهُ رِبِّيُّونَ كَثِيرٌ فَمَا وَهَنُواْ لِمَآ أَصَابَهُمْ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ وَمَا ضَعُفُواْ وَمَا ٱسْتَكَانُواْ وَٱللَّهُ يُحِبُّ ٱلصَّابِرِينَ }
How many a prophet has been killed and with him thousands manifold [fought] but they fainted not in the face of what afflicted them in God's way; they neither weakened nor did they humble themselves. And God loves the patient. Those who followed the course in fidelity who stood fast with regard to purity who did not withdraw from the path ṭarīq and who demanded realization of themselves reproaching themselves by restriction and scrutiny - they found the love of the Real s as a legacy for their patience. The Real was what came after for them at the end of their affair since they did not swerve from the required effort or from the protection of the pact and they submitted themselves utterly abandoning the present world. Every one of them was constant and abiding in holding to the pact and staying true to the condition of service and love.,{ وَمَا كَانَ قَوْلَهُمْ إِلاَّ أَن قَالُواْ ربَّنَا ٱغْفِرْ لَنَا ذُنُوبَنَا وَإِسْرَافَنَا فِيۤ أَمْرِنَا وَثَبِّتْ أَقْدَامَنَا وٱنْصُرْنَا عَلَى ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلْكَافِرِينَ }
All that they said was 'Our Lord forgive us our sins and our excesses in our affairs and make firm our feet and help us against the unbelieving folk'. They recognized the realities of meaning ḥaqāÌiq al-maʿnā and held their tongues from making any claims. Then they spoke seeking forgiveness and holding to an attitude of shyness just as it has been said: He avoided misdeeds and then even became afraid of them. Instead it was as if his good deeds were misdeeds.,{ فَآتَاهُمُ ٱللَّهُ ثَوَابَ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَحُسْنَ ثَوَابِ ٱلآخِرَةِ وَٱللَّهُ يُحِبُّ ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ }
And God gave them the reward of this world The least of that is contentment [with little] qanāʿa then satisfaction [with whatever God wishes] riḌāÌ then living one's life with Him al-ʿaysh maʿahu then intimacy in sitting before Him then the perfection of joy in meeting Him then the independence of the innermost self [from all else] istiqlāl al-sirr through His existence. and the fairest reward of the hereafter and God loves the virtuous. [This refers to] their entering dukhūl the garden. [But] they are emanci- pated from it not entering ghayru dākhilīna into captivity to it. It is said that the reward of this world and the hereafter is absence ghayba from the two abodes looking only to the Creator of them both. When He said “the reward of this world” He said regarding the hereafter “and the fairest reward of the hereafter.” It must be then that the reward of the hereafter is superior to the reward of this world since He gave it the description the fairest. This superiority is [the hereafter's] permanence perfection and fruits; and [the reality] that it cannot be ruined by anything that is incompatible with it nor can any harm occur within it.,{ يَا أَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُوۤاْ إِن تُطِيعُواْ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ يَرُدُّوكُمْ عَلَىٰ أَعْقَابِكُمْ فَتَنقَلِبُواْ خَاسِرِينَ } * { بَلِ ٱللَّهُ مَوْلاَكُمْ وَهُوَ خَيْرُ ٱلنَّاصِرِينَ }
O you who believe if you obey the disbelievers they will make you turn back on your heels and you will revert as losers. Nay but God is your protector and He is the best of helpers. [This] means that if you obey the adversaries they will pull you into their states and cast you into their darknesses. Nay God is your protector your helper the One who aids you Your Master and the One who sets your affairs aright. And He is the best of helpers because He aids you against your lower selves and protects you from their evil. Anyone other than Him adds to your afflictions when they help you because they aid your lower selves against you. And He is the best of helpers because anyone other than Him holds a favor over you in helping you while He rewards you for your asking for His help. It is said that when you ask someone for help you need to give him something of value and then he may or may not help you. But when you ask [God] سبحانه for help He gives you every kindness and takes no pleasure in not helping you.,{ يَا أَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُوۤاْ إِن تُطِيعُواْ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ يَرُدُّوكُمْ عَلَىٰ أَعْقَابِكُمْ فَتَنقَلِبُواْ خَاسِرِينَ } * { بَلِ ٱللَّهُ مَوْلاَكُمْ وَهُوَ خَيْرُ ٱلنَّاصِرِينَ }
O you who believe if you obey the disbelievers they will make you turn back on your heels and you will revert as losers. Nay but God is your protector and He is the best of helpers. [This] means that if you obey the adversaries they will pull you into their states and cast you into their darknesses. Nay God is your protector your helper the One who aids you Your Master and the One who sets your affairs aright.

Anyone other than Him adds to your afflictions when they help you because they aid your lower selves against you. And He is the best of helpers because anyone other than Him holds a favor over you in helping you while He rewards you for your asking for His help. It is said that when you ask someone for help you need to give him something of value and then he may or may not help you. But when you ask [God] سبحانه for help He gives you every kindness and takes no pleasure in not helping you.,{ سَنُلْقِي فِي قُلُوبِ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ ٱلرُّعْبَ بِمَآ أَشْرَكُواْ بِٱللَّهِ مَا لَمْ يُنَزِّلْ بِهِ سُلْطَاناً وَمَأْوَاهُمُ ٱلنَّارُ وَبِئْسَ مَثْوَىٰ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ }
We will cast terror into the hearts of the disbelievers; for that they have associated with God that for which He sent down no authority; their abode shall be the fire; evil is the abode of the evildoers. God سبحانه designated our Prophet ﷺ to cast terror ruʿb from Him into the hearts of His enemies. [The Prophet] عليه السلام said: “I was helped by terror ruʿb.” He also follows this way sunna with His friends. He puts fear hayba of them into hearts. Fear hayba and force qahr would hardly be right in hearts were it not from Him and used with those who follow falsehood make false claims and misrepresent [the truth].,{ وَلَقَدْ صَدَقَكُمُ ٱللَّهُ وَعْدَهُ إِذْ تَحُسُّونَهُمْ بِإِذْنِهِ حَتَّىٰ إِذَا فَشِلْتُمْ وَتَنَازَعْتُمْ فِي ٱلأَمْرِ وَعَصَيْتُمْ مِّن بَعْدِ مَآ أَرَاكُمْ مَّا تُحِبُّونَ مِنكُم مَّن يُرِيدُ الدُّنْيَا وَمِنكُم مَّن يُرِيدُ ٱلآخِرَةَ ثُمَّ صَرَفَكُمْ عَنْهُمْ لِيَبْتَلِيَكُمْ وَلَقَدْ عَفَا عَنْكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ ذُو فَضْلٍ عَلَى ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ }
God has been true to His promise when you slew them by His leave until you lost heart and quarreled over the command; and you disobeyed after he had shown you what you longed for. This verse alludes to the fact that the Real al-ḥaqq raises His friends up aqāma in the right of His right bi-ḥaqqi ḥaqqihi and holds them back from attaining their worldly fortunes ḥuẓūẓ. He سبحانه stands qāma as sufficient for them in every way. Whoever persists in the path of uprightness istiqāma will not deviate from His boundary and [God] will not deviate from His pact for God has been true to His promise to them with beautiful and continuous sufficiency. But whoever falls away from uprightness istiqāma-even if only a step-stumbles in his walking and his state and ability is destabilized to the extent of his offense. Whoever has found increase has been increased from Him and whoever suffers decrease has suffered decrease from Him. Some of you desired this world; and some of you desired the hereafter. Then He turned you away from them so that He might try you; yet now He has pardoned you and God is bounteous to the believers. The value of each person is his desire irāda. Whoever's aspiration himma is for this world his value is base and paltry like this world. Whoever's aspiration is for the hereafter his rank is a noble one. Whoever's aspiration is knowledge of divine lordship rabbāniyya he is the leader sayyid of his time. It is said that whoever is purified of his [lower] desire reaches Him and whoever reaches Him is drawn near to Him by His kindness and is brought close to the place of intimate friendship khuṣūṣiyya in His presence. Then He turned you away from them: This alludes to [the way] He has turned some people away from Him and distracted them from Himself by what is other than Him. Others He turned from any other thing singling them out for Himself. He turned the ascetics zāhidūn away from this world dunyā the worshipers ʿābidūn from following whims hawā the aspirants murīdūn from lower desires munā and those who declare God's oneness muwaḥḥidūn from everything other [than Him] siwā.,{ إِذْ تُصْعِدُونَ وَلاَ تَلْوُونَ عَلَىٰ أحَدٍ وَٱلرَّسُولُ يَدْعُوكُمْ فِيۤ أُخْرَٰكُمْ فَأَثَـٰبَكُمْ غَمّاً بِغَمٍّ لِّكَيْلاَ تَحْزَنُواْ عَلَىٰ مَا فَاتَكُمْ وَلاَ مَآ أَصَـٰبَكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ خَبِيرٌ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ } * { ثُمَّ أَنزَلَ عَلَيْكُمْ مِّن بَعْدِ ٱلْغَمِّ أَمَنَةً نُّعَاساً يَغْشَىٰ طَآئِفَةً مِّنْكُمْ وَطَآئِفَةٌ قَدْ أَهَمَّتْهُمْ أَنْفُسُهُمْ يَظُنُّونَ بِٱللَّهِ غَيْرَ ٱلْحَقِّ ظَنَّ ٱلْجَٰهِلِيَّةِ يَقُولُونَ هَل لَّنَا مِنَ ٱلأَمْرِ مِن شَيْءٍ قُلْ إِنَّ ٱلأَمْرَ كُلَّهُ للَّهِ يُخْفُونَ فِيۤ أَنْفُسِهِم مَّا لاَ يُبْدُونَ لَكَ يَقُولُونَ لَوْ كَانَ لَنَا مِنَ ٱلأَمْرِ شَيْءٌ مَّا قُتِلْنَا هَٰهُنَا قُل لَّوْ كُنتُمْ فِي بُيُوتِكُمْ لَبَرَزَ ٱلَّذِينَ كُتِبَ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلْقَتْلُ إِلَىٰ مَضَاجِعِهِمْ وَلِيَبْتَلِيَ ٱللَّهُ مَا فِي صُدُورِكُمْ وَلِيُمَحِّصَ مَا فِي قُلُوبِكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ بِذَاتِ ٱلصُّدُورِ }
When you were ascending not turning around for anyone and the Messenger was calling you from your rear so he rewarded you with grief for grief so that you might not grieve for what escaped you neither for what befell you; and God is aware of what you do. Then He sent down upon you after grief security-a slumber overcom- ing a party of you and a party whose own souls distressed them thinking wrongly of God thoughts of the age of ignorance saying “Have we any part whatever in the affairḍ” Say: “The affair belongs entirely to God.” They conceal within their hearts what they do not disclose to you saying “Had we had any part in the affair we would not have been slain here.” Say: “Even if you had been in your houses those for whom it had been appointed that they be slain would have sallied forth to the places where they were to lie” that God might try what was in your breasts and that He might prove what was in your hearts; and God knows what is in the breasts. The verse alludes to people for whom a period of slackening fatra occurs. The calls of the Real سبحانه come from within and without so that it is as if the rocks in the streets and the bricks in the walls were crying out to such a one “do not do it O servant of God!” But he is resolved upon his crooked way layy and settled in his error ghayy; [he] refuses to acknowledge what he knows would be more fitting and appropriate for his state. If he were to stay with his [original] aim and follow through with his aspiration by all means he would rein himself in and hold himself back from galloping ahead. [But] he gets nothing but gasping breaths anfās mutaṣāʿida and continuous sorrows ḥasarāt mutawātira-the Real سبحانه has bequeathed him one lonely estrangement after another. Eventually after he has been in this place of distress for a long time the Real سبحانه will relieve him with His beautiful kindness and draw him near with His gracious affection. He will deliver him from the narrowness of his captivity to the spaciousness of His pardon and favor. Many of these [people] will reach the place of the most respected and thereupon become still by God for God when they have been negated from station and honor and they will stand by God for God without waiting to be brought near and without looking to be welcomed.,{ إِذْ تُصْعِدُونَ وَلاَ تَلْوُونَ عَلَىٰ أحَدٍ وَٱلرَّسُولُ يَدْعُوكُمْ فِيۤ أُخْرَٰكُمْ فَأَثَـٰبَكُمْ غَمّاً بِغَمٍّ لِّكَيْلاَ تَحْزَنُواْ عَلَىٰ مَا فَاتَكُمْ وَلاَ مَآ أَصَـٰبَكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ خَبِيرٌ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ } * { ثُمَّ أَنزَلَ عَلَيْكُمْ مِّن بَعْدِ ٱلْغَمِّ أَمَنَةً نُّعَاساً يَغْشَىٰ طَآئِفَةً مِّنْكُمْ وَطَآئِفَةٌ قَدْ أَهَمَّتْهُمْ أَنْفُسُهُمْ يَظُنُّونَ بِٱللَّهِ غَيْرَ ٱلْحَقِّ ظَنَّ ٱلْجَٰهِلِيَّةِ يَقُولُونَ هَل لَّنَا مِنَ ٱلأَمْرِ مِن شَيْءٍ قُلْ إِنَّ ٱلأَمْرَ كُلَّهُ للَّهِ يُخْفُونَ فِيۤ أَنْفُسِهِم مَّا لاَ يُبْدُونَ لَكَ يَقُولُونَ لَوْ كَانَ لَنَا مِنَ ٱلأَمْرِ شَيْءٌ مَّا قُتِلْنَا هَٰهُنَا قُل لَّوْ كُنتُمْ فِي بُيُوتِكُمْ لَبَرَزَ ٱلَّذِينَ كُتِبَ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلْقَتْلُ إِلَىٰ مَضَاجِعِهِمْ وَلِيَبْتَلِيَ ٱللَّهُ مَا فِي صُدُورِكُمْ وَلِيُمَحِّصَ مَا فِي قُلُوبِكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ بِذَاتِ ٱلصُّدُورِ }

Truly those of you who turned away the day the two hosts encountered each other-truly Satan made them slip through some of what they had earned; but God pardoned them; God is Forgiving Forbearing. This verse alludes to the states of those whose spiritual desire irāda has become meager and their intentions niyyāt weak. Their whims hawā control them and listlessness fatra rules them. Face to face with the coun- sel of others the call of desires and the whispers of satans they put their trust in false speech. They have preferred their whims over piety and stayed back. But they do not find happiness in what they have chosen.,{ يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ لاَ تَكُونُواْ كَٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَقَالُواْ لإِخْوَانِهِمْ إِذَا ضَرَبُواْ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ أَوْ كَانُواْ غُزًّى لَّوْ كَانُواْ عِنْدَنَا مَا مَاتُواْ وَمَا قُتِلُواْ لِيَجْعَلَ ٱللَّهُ ذٰلِكَ حَسْرَةً فِي قُلُوبِهِمْ وَٱللَّهُ يُحْيِـي وَيُمِيتُ وَٱللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ }
O you who believe be not as the disbelievers who say of their brothers when they travel in the land or are on raiding campaigns 'Had they been with us they would not have died and would not have been slain' - so that God may make that anguish in their hearts. For God gives life and He gives death and God sees what you do. Whoever makes a habit of worrying about what is past and planning for his future and each new moment - the least of his punishment will be the constriction of his heart through disconcerting worries and the disappearance of the quality of life from his heart because of his forgetfulness and his saying 'if only such and such' or 'maybe such and such'. The result of this kind of thinking is estrangement and grief the constriction of the heart and separation.,{ وَلَئِنْ قُتِلْتُمْ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ أَوْ مُتُّمْ لَمَغْفِرَةٌ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَرَحْمَةٌ خَيْرٌ مِّمَّا يَجْمَعُونَ } * { وَلَئِنْ مُّتُّمْ أَوْ قُتِلْتُمْ لإِلَى ٱلله تُحْشَرُونَ }
And if you are slain in God's way or die forgiveness from God and mercy are better than what they amass. And if you die or are slain it is to God you shall be mustered. To sacrifice the spirit rūḥ in God is better than life with anything other than God. Returning to God is better for one who knows God than staying behind with anything other than God. Whatever the servant prefers over God is not something that is blessed. If you want there is this world and if you want there is the final outcome. And if you die or are slain it is to God you shall be mustered: When the destination is to God the journey is pleasant-surely when a journey to Him comes to an end its hardships seem sweeter than honey!,{ وَلَئِنْ قُتِلْتُمْ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ أَوْ مُتُّمْ لَمَغْفِرَةٌ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَرَحْمَةٌ خَيْرٌ مِّمَّا يَجْمَعُونَ } * { وَلَئِنْ مُّتُّمْ أَوْ قُتِلْتُمْ لإِلَى ٱلله تُحْشَرُونَ }

It was by the mercy of God that you were lenient with them; had you been harsh and fierce of heart they would have dispersed from about you. So pardon them and ask forgiveness for them and consult them in the matter. And when you are resolved rely on God; for God loves those who rely [on Him]. [God] stripped [the Prophet] of his human attributes awṣāf al-bashariyya and singled him out to be clothed from the attribute of lordship naʿt al-rubūbiyya. [God] said that what shone upon him was from the lights of divine governorship tawallī not from the traces of [human states of] agreement and confrontation tabarrī. If not for the fact that He had selected him for what He clothed him in how could he have that qualityḍ! It is said that among the particular properties of [God's] سبحانه mercy to [the Prophet] was that He gave him strength to keep company with them and patience to convey the message to them in spite of what he had to endure from them in their arguing. He was utterly engaged at every moment with an authority from the Real that overwhelmed him-[even while] they were arguing with this authority. If not for the divine strength the Real chose for him alone how could he have been able to keep company with themḍ When Moses عليه السلام had just returned from hearing [God's] word was he not unable to remain patient in speaking with his brotherḍ He grabbed his head pulling [Aaron] toward him. It is said that if it were not for the fact that [the Prophet] ﷺ saw them effaced in what came to them from the decrees of [God's] disposition aḥkām al-taṣrīf and his realization that the originator of these [decrees] was God he would not have been able to keep company with them. Had you been harsh and fierce of heart they would have dispersed from about you: “If you had given them the pure drink of the declaration of unity tawḥīd undiluted with their worldly concerns they would have separated from you and wandered about unable to stand still for even a moment. So pardon them for neglecting the right and respect due to you and the negligence you have seen in them in serving Us and obeying Us-rise up [instead] as an intercessor shafīʿ to Us on their behalf.,{ إِن يَنصُرْكُمُ ٱللَّهُ فَلاَ غَالِبَ لَكُمْ وَإِن يَخْذُلْكُمْ فَمَن ذَا ٱلَّذِي يَنصُرُكُم مِّنْ بَعْدِهِ وَعَلَى ٱللَّهِ فَلْيَتَوَكَّلِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ }
If God helps you then none can overcome you; but if He forsakes you then who is there who can help you after Himḍ Therefore on God let the believers rely. He helps the believers by granting success to the bodily forms bi-l-tawfīqi lil-ashbāḥ and then by granting [spiritual] realization to the spirits thuma bi-l-taḥqīqi lil-arwāḥ. It is said that God helps you by supporting you in your outward cir- cumstances bi-taÌyīdi al-ẓawāhir and by guiding the innermost selves wa-tasdīdi al-sarāÌir. It is said that while [He will] help [you] against the enemy the worst enemy you have is the lower self within you. [His] help against [your] lower self comes when its claims of strength are routed by the guardians of His mercy and the armies of cravings junūd al-shahawāt scatter upon the attacks of the arriving hosts wufūd al-munāzilāt. The protective friend- ship walāya of God will remain purified from the confused clamoring of human qualities and the cravings and desires of the lower selves which are the remaining effects of [what] veils and hinders [people] from nearness. If He forsakes you: The forsaking is the abandonment of those who are disobedient. Those whom He helps He holds back from pursuing what is objectionable and those to whom He gives free rein and leaves to their own bad choices He forsakes. The state [of someone He forsakes] becomes unsettled in the torrents of cravings so he sometimes wanders to the east without shame fa-marratan yusharriqu ghayra muḥtashimin and sometimes to the west without respect wa-tāratan yugharribu ghayra mutaḥrimin. Surely when the Real lets someone go and does not take him by the hand leaving him to himself there is no protector for him. Therefore on God let believers rely in finding security through sincere supplication and laying the robe of pardon over the defects of sin. [This is done] by devoutly seeking refuge and by rejecting any strength or power [other than God]. It is said that when the matter was that of [His] help He said “then none can overcome you.” In the matter of being forsaken He did not say “then there is no helper for you” but rather said more indirectly“then who is there who can help you after Himḍ” Here there is a subtlety regarding the finer properties of the [divine] address.,{ وَمَا كَانَ لِنَبِيٍّ أَنْ يَغُلَّ وَمَن يَغْلُلْ يَأْتِ بِمَا غَلَّ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ ثُمَّ تُوَفَّىٰ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ مَّا كَسَبَتْ وَهُمْ لاَ يُظْلَمُونَ }
It is not for a prophet to be fraudulent; whoever defrauds [others] shall bring what he has defrauded on the Day of Resurrection; then every soul shall be paid in full what it has earned and they shall not be wronged. He has made the states of the prophets free of the stain of treacherous actions. “Those to whom We gave the message to bear to Our servants convey it to those who should receive it. They are not concerned with any affair of a close intimate without Our command and they do not hold back harboring malice in passing on anyone's share when We have commanded it.” Do you not see how [the Prophet] said of Abū Ṭālib “Go and bury him” when the Commander of the Believers ʿAlī رضي الله عنه said to him “Your erring uncle has died”ḍ Do you not see how [Muḥammad] accepted al-Waḥshī the killer of ḥamza when he became a Muslimḍ It is said “It was not for any prophet ﷺ to give Our secrets to any but the people to whom they were meant. Rather to each was revealed what they were meant to hear.” Thus in the tradition “We were commanded to reveal yunzil to the people [what is suitable according to] their stations manāzil.”,{ أَفَمَنِ ٱتَّبَعَ رِضْوَانَ ٱللَّهِ كَمَن بَآءَ بِسَخَطٍ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَمَأْوَاهُ جَهَنَّمُ وَبِئْسَ ٱلْمَصِيرُ } * { هُمْ دَرَجَـٰتٌ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ وٱللَّهُ بَصِيرٌ بِمَا يَعْمَلُونَ }
Is he who follows God's beatitude like him who is laden with God's anger whose abode is hellḍ An evil journey's end! They are of degrees before God; and God sees what they do. The one with whom He is well pleased throughout eternity fī azālihi is not equal to the one with whom He is displeased and has abandoned in his states fī aḥwālihi and left him to rely on his own actions ʿalā aʿmālihi oblivious to the witnessing of His favors li-shuhūdi afḌālihi. To seek God's beatitude [one must] separate oneself mufāraqa from what has been prohibited and embrace muʿānaqa what has been commanded. One who divests himself from the prohibited mazjūr and takes heart in embracing what has been commanded maÌmūr has followed God's beatitude riḌwān and has become deserving of the gardens jinān. They are of degrees before God: that is they possess degrees in the decree ḥukm of God-happy are those who have been brought close and wretched are those who have been kept at a distance.,{ أَفَمَنِ ٱتَّبَعَ رِضْوَانَ ٱللَّهِ كَمَن بَآءَ بِسَخَطٍ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَمَأْوَاهُ جَهَنَّمُ وَبِئْسَ ٱلْمَصِيرُ } * { هُمْ دَرَجَـٰتٌ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ وٱللَّهُ بَصِيرٌ بِمَا يَعْمَلُونَ }

Truly God was gracious to the believers when He sent to them a mes- senger from among their own to recite to them His verses and to purify them and to teach them the Book wisdom though before they were in clear error. [God] gave goodness to them in abundance and favored them with gener- ous blessings for He sent someone like MuṣṬafā the leader of mankind ﷺ to them. [The Prophet] taught them their religion and made their proofs clear to them. He belonged to them in every way but they were not grateful for his blessings did not respect his right and were not able to see what he guided them to nor refrain from straying in error-this is a description of his enemies who denied and were arrogant. As for the believers they were adorned with grace in the [divine] choice ikhtiyār. They received the command to hear and obey to the utmost of their capacity iqtidār so they were happy in this world and the hereafter ʿuqbā and became deserving of generosity and nearness zulfa from God.,{ أَوَلَمَّآ أَصَـٰبَتْكُمْ مُّصِيبَةٌ قَدْ أَصَبْتُمْ مِّثْلَيْهَا قُلْتُمْ أَنَّىٰ هَـٰذَا قُلْ هُوَ مِنْ عِندِ أَنْفُسِكُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ }
And why when distress befell you and you had afflicted twice the like of it did you say “How is thisḍ” Say: “It is from yourselves. Surely God has power over everything.” Human beings usually forget their own error and disobedience ʿiṣyān and turn instead to accuse God of what comes to them in trials loss khusrān and all kinds of unpleasant and difficult things iftitān. It would be better for those who pursue various crimes ṣunūf al-ijrām not to forget the requital to come ḥulūl al-intiqām.,{ وَمَآ أَصَابَكُمْ يَوْمَ ٱلْتَقَى ٱلْجَمْعَانِ فَبِإِذْنِ ٱللَّهِ وَلِيَعْلَمَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ } * { وَلِيَعْلَمَ ٱلَّذِينَ نَافَقُواْ وَقِيلَ لَهُمْ تَعَالَوْاْ قَاتِلُواْ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ أَوِ ٱدْفَعُواْ قَالُواْ لَوْ نَعْلَمُ قِتَالاً لاَّتَّبَعْنَاكُمْ هُمْ لِلْكُفْرِ يَوْمَئِذٍ أَقْرَبُ مِنْهُمْ لِلإِيمَانِ يَقُولُونَ بِأَفْوَاهِهِم مَّا لَيْسَ فِي قُلُوبِهِمْ وَٱللَّهُ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا يَكْتُمُونَ }
And what afflicted you the day the two hosts encountered was by God's leave and that He might know the believers. And that He might also know the hypocrites when it was said to them “Come now fight in the way of God or defend [yourselves]” they said “If we knew how to fight we would follow you.” That day they were nearer to unbelief than to belief saying with their mouths that which was not in their hearts. And God knows best what they hide. He lightened the grave calamity met by the believers and possessors of insight on the Day of Uḥud by saying that the encounter was by God's leave. Surely a trial that afflicts [one] by God's leave is sweeter than honey and more desirable than any blessing. Then He spoke of those who were not sincere comrades how they offered excuses and were lazy. Similarly when the one who is tired wants to break things off he becomes weary of being together and says “That was that.” Saying with their mouths that which was not in their hearts: Verily they gave honey to drink [to their enemies] but He plotted to put poison in it for them. And they schemed; and God schemed; and God is the best of schemers [3:54].,{ وَمَآ أَصَابَكُمْ يَوْمَ ٱلْتَقَى ٱلْجَمْعَانِ فَبِإِذْنِ ٱللَّهِ وَلِيَعْلَمَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ } * { وَلِيَعْلَمَ ٱلَّذِينَ نَافَقُواْ وَقِيلَ لَهُمْ تَعَالَوْاْ قَاتِلُواْ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ أَوِ ٱدْفَعُواْ قَالُواْ لَوْ نَعْلَمُ قِتَالاً لاَّتَّبَعْنَاكُمْ هُمْ لِلْكُفْرِ يَوْمَئِذٍ أَقْرَبُ مِنْهُمْ لِلإِيمَانِ يَقُولُونَ بِأَفْوَاهِهِم مَّا لَيْسَ فِي قُلُوبِهِمْ وَٱللَّهُ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا يَكْتُمُونَ }

Those who said to their brothers while they themselves stayed put “Had they obeyed us they would not have been slain.” Say: “Then avert death from yourselves if you speak the truth.” Those who relied upon their lower selves-having been seduced by them to prefer their own whims-and then opposed those who gave themselves over to the decrees of divine fate said “If only they had heeded the warning about going out to the battle they would have been safe.” These thoughts are blameworthy and these hearts have retreated from witnessing the true nature of things. Say to them O Muḥammad “[Then] extend the life of your souls istadīmū lil-anfusikum al-ḥayāt and defend them from the attacks of death wa-idfaʿū ʿanhā hujūma al-wafāt.” How would they be able to do thatḍ How preposterous!,{ وَلاَ تَحْسَبَنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ قُتِلُواْ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ أَمْوَاتاً بَلْ أَحْيَاءٌ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ يُرْزَقُونَ } * { فَرِحِينَ بِمَآ آتَاهُمُ ٱللَّهُ مِن فَضْلِهِ وَيَسْتَبْشِرُونَ بِٱلَّذِينَ لَمْ يَلْحَقُواْ بِهِم مِّنْ خَلْفِهِمْ أَلاَّ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلاَ هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ }
Count not those who were slain in God's way as dead but rather liv- ing with their Lord provided for [by Him]. Rejoicing in what God has given them of His bounty and rejoicing for the sake of those who have not joined them but are left behind that no fear shall befall them neither shall they grieve. Life in remembrance of the Real-after the lower selves have been anni- hilated in the good pleasure of the Real-is more perfect than remaining with the blessings of created beings and being veiled from the Real. It is said that the one whose heir is the Living is one who does not disappear and cannot die even if he is killed: Surely bodies have been brought into existence for death so the slaying of a human being in God without doubt is best. And rejoicing for the sake of those who have not joined them but are left behind: Those who know that their loved ones are waiting for them while they are in comfort and ease [in the garden] would not take pleasure in living without being with them.,{ وَلاَ تَحْسَبَنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ قُتِلُواْ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ أَمْوَاتاً بَلْ أَحْيَاءٌ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ يُرْزَقُونَ } * { فَرِحِينَ بِمَآ آتَاهُمُ ٱللَّهُ مِن فَضْلِهِ وَيَسْتَبْشِرُونَ بِٱلَّذِينَ لَمْ يَلْحَقُواْ بِهِم مِّنْ خَلْفِهِمْ أَلاَّ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلاَ هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ }

Joyful in grace and bounty from God and [joyful in knowing] that God does not let the wage of believers go to waste. The cause and reason for their being joyful is a bounty and grace from God. That is to say how would they be joyful if not for His grace and bounty to themḍ Their being joyful in grace is only because they are His servants and He is their protector. If not for His grace and favor to them they would not be in this state.,{ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱسْتَجَابُواْ للَّهِ وَٱلرَّسُولِ مِن بَعْدِ مَآ أَصَابَهُمُ ٱلْقَرْحُ لِلَّذِينَ أَحْسَنُواْ مِنْهُمْ وَٱتَّقَواْ أَجْرٌ عَظِيمٌ }
[For] those who responded to God and the Messenger after the wounds had afflicted them those who did good among them and feared shall be a great wage. [The meaning of the tenth form verb] “to respond” istijāba has an element of merit and superiority over [the meaning of the fourth form verb] “to answer” ijāba. This is an allusive distinction rather than [a distinction] required [linguistically] by the Arabic. It [means] that they respond will- ingly not under compulsion. They respond to God without [their response] entailing the bearing of a difficulty. Rather [they respond] by the directive of the heart's core ishārat al-qalb and the love of the heart fuÌād and the choice of the spirit rūḥ and find delight in bearing [God's] decree ḥukm. So the response to the Real [comes] from recognizing the reality of His existence bi-l-taḥaqquq bi-wujūdihi and the response to the Messenger عليه السلام [comes] from taking on character traits as prescribed by [God's] limits bi-takhalluq bi-ḥudūdihi. The response of the Real [comes] from the quintessence of the truth of lordship bi-l-ṣafāÌ fī ḥaqqi al-rubūbiyya and the response of the Messenger عليه السلام [comes] from fidelity in upholding ser- vanthood bi-l-wafāÌ fī iqāmati al-ʿubūdiyya. After the wounds had afflicted them: [This refers to] the beginning of their transactions before the appearance of the lights of disclosure to their hearts and the smiling of the realities in their innermost selves. Those who did good among them: “Doing good is that you worship God as if you see Him”-and this is witnessing mushāhada and fear of God taqwā-”for if you do not see Him He sees you”-and this is awareness [of God watching you] murāqaba in the state of spiritual struggle mujāhada. A great wage for novices later li-ahli al-bidāyati muÌajjalan and for adepts now wa-li-ahli al-nihāyati muʿajjalan.,{ ٱلَّذِينَ قَالَ لَهُمُ ٱلنَّاسُ إِنَّ ٱلنَّاسَ قَدْ جَمَعُواْ لَكُمْ فَٱخْشَوْهُمْ فَزَادَهُمْ إِيمَاناً وَقَالُواْ حَسْبُنَا ٱللَّهُ وَنِعْمَ ٱلْوَكِيلُ }
Those to whom people said “The people have gathered against you therefore fear them”; but that increased them in faith and they said “God is sufficient for us an excellent Guardian is He.” [Whenever] events in the present world confused them outwardly the gleams from unveilings Ṭawāliʿ min al-kushūfāt opened up for them in their innermost selves asrār and they increased in one level of certainty after another. Among the signs of certainty is the reliance of hearts in God alone with the severing of any hope of imagined aid and support from created beings.,{ فَٱنْقَلَبُواْ بِنِعْمَةٍ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَفَضْلٍ لَّمْ يَمْسَسْهُمْ سُوۤءٌ وَٱتَّبَعُواْ رِضْوَانَ ٱللَّهِ وَٱللَّهُ ذُو فَضْلٍ عَظِيمٍ }
So they returned with grace and bounty from God and no evil touched them and they followed the beatitude of God; and God is of bounty abounding. Such is the way sunna of the Real سبحانه with those who are sincere in taking refuge with Him in that He prepares a resting place in the shadow of His sufficiency. No affliction touches them no pains distress them and no hardships overcome them.,{ إِنَّمَا ذٰلِكُمُ ٱلشَّيْطَـٰنُ يُخَوِّفُ أَوْلِيَاءَهُ فَلاَ تَخَافُوهُمْ وَخَافُونِ إِن كُنتُمْ مُّؤْمِنِينَ }
That is only Satan making fear his friends therefore do not fear them; but fear Me if you are believers. The allusion in [God's] granting power to the calls of Satan in the hearts of [His] friends is [to the test] that confirms their flight to God. This is like a child who has been frightened by one of those things that frighten children and when he is afraid he goes only to his mother. When he comes to her she takes him to herself hugs him and presses her cheek to his. Likewise when the servant is sincere in beseeching God and returns to Him from his oppositional tendencies He takes him under the wing of His closeness and overtakes him with His beautiful kindness.,{ وَلاَ يَحْزُنكَ ٱلَّذِينَ يُسَارِعُونَ فِي ٱلْكُفْرِ إِنَّهُمْ لَن يَضُرُّواْ ٱللَّهَ شَيْئاً يُرِيدُ ٱللَّهُ أَلاَّ يَجْعَلَ لَهُمْ حَظّاً فِي ٱلآخِرَةِ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ عَظِيمٌ }
Let them not grieve you those that vie with one another in unbelief; they will not hurt God at all. God desires not to assign them any portion in the hereafter and theirs is a mighty chastisement. He strengthened [Muḥammad's] heart by renewing the firmness of the pact in that He would not allow any enemy to gloat over his misfortune nor allow any evil from them to reach him.,{ إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱشْتَرَوُاْ ٱلْكُفْرَ بِٱلإِيمَانِ لَن يَضُرُّواْ ٱللَّهَ شَيْئاً وَلهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ }
Those who purchase unbelief at the price of faith they will not hurt God at all and there awaits them a painful chastisement. If they cause harm aḌarrū it is only to themselves. If they persist aṣarrū they persist only to their own loss. We did not suffer from the distance to their abodes nor did longings drive us toward them.,{ وَلاَ يَحْسَبَنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ أَنَّمَا نُمْلِي لَهُمْ خَيْرٌ لأَنْفُسِهِمْ إِنَّمَا نُمْلِي لَهُمْ لِيَزْدَادُوۤاْ إِثْمَاً وَلَهْمُ عَذَابٌ مُّهِينٌ }
And let not the disbelievers suppose that what We indulge them in is better for their souls. We grant them indulgence only that they may increase in sinfulness and theirs is a humbling chastisement. “Part of the perfection of the ruse against them and the intensification in their punishment is that We are punishing them even as they do not perceive it: We will draw them on by degrees whence they do not know [7:182]. We indulge them and they think that it is an act of favor inʿām; [they do] not consider that it might be an act of revenge intiqām.” When the underlying forces of the divine preordination are made clear to them [in] their hiding places they will know that they have lost khusrān. It is already clear to anyone possessing insight that that which brings about disobedience ʿiṣyān or causes forgetfulness nisyān cannot be counted among the acts of favor inʿām.,{ مَّا كَانَ ٱللَّهُ لِيَذَرَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ عَلَىٰ مَآ أَنْتُمْ عَلَيْهِ حَتَّىٰ يَمِيزَ ٱلْخَبِيثَ مِنَ ٱلطَّيِّبِ وَمَا كَانَ ٱللَّهُ لِيُطْلِعَكُمْ عَلَى ٱلْغَيْبِ وَلَكِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَجْتَبِي مِن رُّسُلِهِ مَن يَشَآءُ فَآمِنُواْ بِٱللَّهِ وَرُسُلِهِ وَإِن تُؤْمِنُواْ وَتَتَّقُواْ فَلَكُمْ أَجْرٌ عَظِيمٌ }
It is not God's purpose to leave the believers in the state in which you are till He shall distinguish the evil one from the good. And it is not God's purpose to apprise you of the unseen but God chooses of His messengers whom He will. So believe in God and His messengers; and if you believe and guard [against evil] then yours shall be a great wage. He has gathered [humankind] together in the here and now with respect to bodies and forms mabānī but has separated them in the deeper realities and meanings maʿānī. Some of them are good Ṭayyib in their natural disposition and some are evil khabīth. Even if their constitutions are mixed they are differentiated in the inner sight of the elect. And it is not God's purpose to apprise you of the unseen: Surely the secrets of the unseen do not appear to those who are sullied by the pollu- tions of mortal human nature bashariyya. Only the Real سبحانه possesses knowledge of that which is great and small and He selects whomever He will among His prophets for knowledge of some of His secrets.,{ وَلاَ يَحْسَبَنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يَبْخَلُونَ بِمَآ آتَاهُمُ ٱللَّهُ مِن فَضْلِهِ هُوَ خَيْراً لَّهُمْ بَلْ هُوَ شَرٌّ لَّهُمْ سَيُطَوَّقُونَ مَا بَخِلُواْ بِهِ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ وَللَّهِ مِيرَاثُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَٱللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيرٌ }
But as for those who are niggardly with what God has given them of His bounty let them not suppose that it is better for them; nay it is worse for them; what they were niggardly with they shall have hung around their necks on the Day of Resurrection; and to God belongs the inheritance of the heavens and the earth. And God is aware of what you do. Whoever prefers something to God He will not bless him in that. No enjoy- ment istimtāʿ in that will last for him in this world and there will be no defense difāʿ from the punishment for it in the hereafter. In the language of the scholars ʿulamāÌ “niggardliness” is the with- holding of what is obligatory. According to the [people of] allusion ishāra it is holding back anything even if only a particle of wealth or a breath from states.,{ لَّقَدْ سَمِعَ ٱللَّهُ قَوْلَ ٱلَّذِينَ قَالُوۤاْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ فَقِيرٌ وَنَحْنُ أَغْنِيَآءُ سَنَكْتُبُ مَا قَالُواْ وَقَتْلَهُمُ ٱلأَنبِيَاءَ بِغَيْرِ حَقٍّ وَنَقُولُ ذُوقُواْ عَذَابَ ٱلْحَرِيقِ } * { ذٰلِكَ بِمَا قَدَّمَتْ أَيْدِيكُمْ وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَيْسَ بِظَلاَّمٍ لِّلْعَبِيدِ }
Verily God has heard the saying of those who said “Indeed God is poor and we are rich.” We shall write down what they have said and their slaying the prophets without right and We shall say “Taste the chastisement of the burning. That is for what your hands have sent before; for God is never unjust toward His servants.” If this address were between created beings it would be a complaint and the complaint to friends about enemies is the way of lovers sunnat al-aḥbāb. It is said that He knew that there were those among the believers who were slandering people and this was an ugly way to speak but He exposed a greater ugliness. This was to show that the ugly speech of the believers was paltry in comparison to the ugliness of the speech of the disbelievers. It is as if He said “Their speech has been ugly in its defamation but the speech of the disbelievers is even uglier since they have described Us in a way that is not appropriate for Us.” [This verse] also alludes to the call to humankind and the [divine] for- bearance with those who quarrel [with that call] for surely God سبحانه did not deprive them of what He had given them [in this world] in spite of their disregard for His rights. We shall write down what they have said: These words are cause for embarrassment for the neglectful through the most delicate allusion. It means that even if they have forgotten their states and words “We will resurrect for them what We have written against them.” Their speaker said: I have pages in which blame is buried. One day they will be published and the blame will linger. I will be patient until God brings us together and if we meet one day I will speak. That is for what your hands have sent before: for God is never unjust toward His servants: If this were from one created being to another it would be like absolving oneself of blame for what one has done. It is as if He سبحانه is saying “My servant the punishment that will come to you on that day is because of your sin. If you had not done it We would not punish you.”,{ لَّقَدْ سَمِعَ ٱللَّهُ قَوْلَ ٱلَّذِينَ قَالُوۤاْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ فَقِيرٌ وَنَحْنُ أَغْنِيَآءُ سَنَكْتُبُ مَا قَالُواْ وَقَتْلَهُمُ ٱلأَنبِيَاءَ بِغَيْرِ حَقٍّ وَنَقُولُ ذُوقُواْ عَذَابَ ٱلْحَرِيقِ } * { ذٰلِكَ بِمَا قَدَّمَتْ أَيْدِيكُمْ وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَيْسَ بِظَلاَّمٍ لِّلْعَبِيدِ }
Verily God has heard the saying of those who said “Indeed God is poor and we are rich.” We shall write down what they have said and their slaying the prophets without right and We shall say “Taste the chastisement of the burning. That is for what your hands have sent before; for God is never unjust toward His servants.” If this address were between created beings it would be a complaint and the complaint to friends about enemies is the way of lovers sunnat al-aḥbāb. It is said that He knew that there were those among the believers who were slandering people and this was an ugly way to speak but He exposed a greater ugliness. This was to show that the ugly speech of the believers was paltry in comparison to the ugliness of the speech of the disbelievers. It is as if He said “Their speech has been ugly in its defamation but the speech of the disbelievers is even uglier since they have described Us in a way that is not appropriate for Us.” [This verse] also alludes to the call to humankind and the [divine] for- bearance with those who quarrel [with that call] for surely God سبحانه did not deprive them of what He had given them [in this world] in spite of their disregard for His rights. We shall write down what they have said: These words are cause for embarrassment for the neglectful through the most delicate allusion. It means that even if they have forgotten their states and words “We will resurrect for them what We have written against them.” Their speaker said: I have pages in which blame is buried. One day they will be published and the blame will linger. I will be patient until God brings us together and if we meet one day I will speak. That is for what your hands have sent before: for God is never unjust toward His servants: If this were from one created being to another it would be like absolving oneself of blame for what one has done. It is as if He سبحانه is saying “My servant the punishment that will come to you on that day is because of your sin. If you had not done it We would not punish you.”,{ ٱلَّذِينَ قَالُوۤاْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَهِدَ إِلَيْنَا أَلاَّ نُؤْمِنَ لِرَسُولٍ حَتَّىٰ يَأْتِيَنَا بِقُرْبَانٍ تَأْكُلُهُ ٱلنَّارُ قُلْ قَدْ جَآءَكُمْ رُسُلٌ مِّن قَبْلِي بِٱلْبَيِّنَاتِ وَبِٱلَّذِي قُلْتُمْ فَلِمَ قَتَلْتُمُوهُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ صَادِقِينَ }
[They are the] same who said “God has already made a covenant with us that we should not believe in any messenger until he brings us an offering to be devoured by fire.” Say: “Messengers have come to you before me with clear proofs and with that which you said. Why did you slay them then if you are truthfulḍ” They fabricated lies about God سبحانه to excuse their lack of faith saying “Verily we have been commanded not to believe anyone if we do not see him with our own eyes bringing us an offering. He will offer it to the sky and then a fire will come down to take it.” God most high said “say to them that those who have come before me among the prophets [عليه السلام] have brought you what you have demanded of me in offering but you did not believe. If I were to accede to you in this you would once again not believe.” Whoever has been kept at a distance by what has already been decreed-if the sun were to speak to him with a clear tongue or the mountains prostrate before him and he were to see all this in a moment of truth deeper knowledge ʿirfān would still not enter his heart and he would only increase in doubt after doubt.,{ فَإِن كَذَّبُوكَ فَقَدْ كُذِّبَ رُسُلٌ مِّن قَبْلِكَ جَآءُوا بِٱلْبَيِّنَاتِ وَٱلزُّبُرِ وَٱلْكِتَابِ ٱلْمُنِيرِ }
But if they deny you so were denied messengers before you who came bearing clear proofs and the scriptures and the illuminating Book. That is the habitual practice of disbelievers is to deny the messengers. This is what their ancestors used to do ʿalā hadhā l-naḥwi daraja salafuhum and their descendants follow their way wa-bi-hadyihi iqtadā khalafuhum.,{ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ ذَآئِقَةُ ٱلْمَوْتِ وَإِنَّمَا تُوَفَّوْنَ أُجُورَكُمْ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ فَمَن زُحْزِحَ عَنِ ٱلنَّارِ وَأُدْخِلَ ٱلْجَنَّةَ فَقَدْ فَازَ وَما ٱلْحَيَاةُ ٱلدُّنْيَا إِلاَّ مَتَاعُ ٱلْغُرُورِ }
Every soul shall taste of death; you shall surely be paid in full your wages on the Day of Resurrection. Whoever is moved away from the fire and admitted to paradise will have triumphed the life of this world is but the comfort of delusion. That is “The cup of death is placed in the palm of every living being. Whoever's soul nafs finds it sweet and agreeable-I bequeath to him the intoxication of ecstatic finding wajd. Whoever swallows it with a frowning face falls into the abyss of rejection radd and is branded by the burning of obstruction ṣadd. Then [there is the Day] of the Resurrection. Whoever is protected from the fire reaches the greatest repose waṣala ilā l-rāḥati al-kubrā and whoever is made to burn in the blazing fire falls into the greatest tribulation waqaʿa fī l-miḥnati al-kubrā.” The life of this world is but the comfort of delusion because what is coming is nigh.,{ لَتُبْلَوُنَّ فِيۤ أَمْوَالِكُمْ وَأَنْفُسِكُمْ وَلَتَسْمَعُنَّ مِنَ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ ٱلْكِتَابَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ وَمِنَ ٱلَّذِينَ أَشْرَكُوۤاْ أَذًى كَثِيراً وَإِن تَصْبِرُواْ وَتَتَّقُواْ فَإِنَّ ذٰلِكَ مِنْ عَزْمِ ٱلأُمُورِ }
You shall surely be tried in your property; and in your selves and you shall bear from those who were given the scripture before you and from those who are idolaters much hurt but if you are patient and fear-surely that is true resolve. [God] spared [the believers] from what would have been even greater occa- sions of harm by alerting them before the attacks. He taught them two of the best precepts: to prefer patience and to choose to remain still under the streams of the decrees.,{ وَإِذْ أَخَذَ ٱللَّهُ مِيثَاقَ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ ٱلْكِتَابَ لَتُبَيِّنُنَّهُ لِلنَّاسِ وَلاَ تَكْتُمُونَهُ فَنَبَذُوهُ وَرَآءَ ظُهُورِهِمْ وَٱشْتَرَوْاْ بِهِ ثَمَناً قَلِيلاً فَبِئْسَ مَا يَشْتَرُونَ }
And when God made a covenant with those who had been given the scripture “You shall expound it to people and not conceal it.” But they rejected it behind their backs and bought it with a small price; how evil is what they have bought! [God] said that they had vowed to uphold their agreements but broke the ties of the covenant in turning to disbelief. Then it became clear that what they took as cheap substitutes for leaving religion would have no blessings for them.,{ لاَ تَحْسَبَنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يَفْرَحُونَ بِمَآ أَتَوْاْ وَّيُحِبُّونَ أَن يُحْمَدُواْ بِمَا لَمْ يَفْعَلُواْ فَلاَ تَحْسَبَنَّهُمْ بِمَفَازَةٍ مِّنَ ٱلْعَذَابِ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ }
Do not reckon that those who rejoice in what they have brought and who love to be praised for what they have not done-do not reckon them secure from the chastisement; there shall be a painful chastisement for them. Surely those whose hearts look only to created beings and whose innermost secrets regard only [created beings]-do not think that their punishment will be delayed to the Day of Resurrection. No they are not secure from the punishment in the here and now. What punishment is more intense than being thrown back to created beings khalq and veiled from the Real ḥaqqḍ,{ وَللَّهِ مُلْكُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ }
To God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and God has power over all things. This verse alludes to [God's] lack of need for anyone in existence. How could He have any need of themḍ But they [on the other hand] will find no one to stand in for Him and no substitute for Him.,{ إِنَّ فِي خَلْقِ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَٱخْتِلاَفِ ٱلَّيلِ وَٱلنَّهَارِ لآيَاتٍ لأُوْلِي ٱلأَلْبَابِ } * { ٱلَّذِينَ يَذْكُرُونَ ٱللَّهَ قِيَاماً وَقُعُوداً وَعَلَىٰ جُنُوبِهِمْ وَيَتَفَكَّرُونَ فِي خَلْقِ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ رَبَّنَآ مَا خَلَقْتَ هَذا بَاطِلاً سُبْحَانَكَ فَقِنَا عَذَابَ النَّارِ }
Surely in the creation of the heavens and the earth and in the alterna- tion of night and day there are signs for people of pith. Those who remember God standing and sitting and on their sides The signs which the Real سبحانه presents to ordinary people are from the lessons and the vestiges [of people gone by] in the regions [of the heavens and the earth]. The signs which He presents to the elect are within their souls. [God] سبحانه said “We shall show them Our signs in the horizons and in their own souls” [41:53]. The outer signs lead to the knowledge of certainty ʿilm al-yaqīn while the inner signs lead to the eye of certainty ʿayn al-yaqīn. The alternation ikhtilāf of night and day alludes to the different responses ikhtilāf to the night among the servants. The nights of the people of communion are short and the nights of the people of separation are long. [Someone] said: Months pass- we have not noticed their midpoints nor their ends. And he said: For you morning is drunkenness and the night a hangover. You slept even as the days of happiness were short. A second [poet] said: After they departed the nights were long in so many ways- [once short] the night of the lovers is [now] long. A third [poet] had nothing to say about the length or brevity of the night for he said because of what had overwhelmed him: How should I know whether the night was long or notḍ How can one who is on fire know thatḍ If I had paid attention to the length of the night I would have been deprived of watching the stars. For people of pith: The people of pith ulū l-albāb are those whose intellects have been kept sound from the drunkenness of forgetfulness and inattention. The sign of one like this is that his gaze will be through the Real. When he gazes from the Real to the Real his gaze is in the right direction. But when he gazes from created beings and things to the Real his thoughts are thrown into upheaval which causes a state of confusion. Those who remember God standing and sitting: Remembrance dhikr permeates their every moment. If they stand it is in remembrance of Him.,{ إِنَّ فِي خَلْقِ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَٱخْتِلاَفِ ٱلَّيلِ وَٱلنَّهَارِ لآيَاتٍ لأُوْلِي ٱلأَلْبَابِ } * { ٱلَّذِينَ يَذْكُرُونَ ٱللَّهَ قِيَاماً وَقُعُوداً وَعَلَىٰ جُنُوبِهِمْ وَيَتَفَكَّرُونَ فِي خَلْقِ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ رَبَّنَآ مَا خَلَقْتَ هَذا بَاطِلاً سُبْحَانَكَ فَقِنَا عَذَابَ النَّارِ }

Our Lord whomever You admit into the fire You will have abased and the evildoers shall have no helpers. “Whomever You put to the test in the future by burning ḥurqa You will have abased him. And whomever you put to the test by separation furqa in the present you will have made him miserable. Whomever you have entrusted with the good fortune of communion wuṣla You will have sheltered him and brought him close.”,{ رَّبَّنَآ إِنَّنَآ سَمِعْنَا مُنَادِياً يُنَادِي لِلإِيمَانِ أَنْ آمِنُواْ بِرَبِّكُمْ فَآمَنَّا رَبَّنَا فَٱغْفِرْ لَنَا ذُنُوبَنَا وَكَفِّرْ عَنَّا سَيِّئَاتِنَا وَتَوَفَّنَا مَعَ ٱلأَبْرَارِ }
“Our Lord we have heard a caller calling to belief saying 'Believe in your Lord!' And we believed. So our Lord forgive us our sins and absolve us of our evil deeds and take us [in death] with the pious. It means “We have answered the caller dāʿī but You are the guide hādī so do not leave us to ourselves and do not raise the shadow of your care from us.” Faith īmān is entering into that which brings security amān and one only has faith in the Real from the Real granting him security. The security of the Real for the servant which is His granting him protection brings about the faith of the servant in the Real which is his affirmation taṣdīq of Him and his deep recognition maʿrifa of Him. And take us [in death] with the pious: They are those chosen for the proper ways of declaring oneness ḥaqāÌiq al-tawḥīd those who stand for God [according] to the conditions of utter devotion sharāÌiṬ al-tafrīd and stay with God by the special characteristics of disengaging [from anything other than Him] khaṣāÌiṣ al-tajrīd.,{ رَبَّنَا وَآتِنَا مَا وَعَدتَّنَا عَلَىٰ رُسُلِكَ وَلاَ تُخْزِنَا يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ إِنَّكَ لاَ تُخْلِفُ ٱلْمِيعَادَ }
“Our Lord grant us what You have promised us through Your messen- gers and abase us not on the Day of Resurrection. You will not fail the tryst.” “Verify for us what You have promised us through the words of your inter- mediaries in the perfection of blessed happiness nuʿmā and the absolu- tion of [our] evil [deeds] sūÌā and forgiveness for pursuing our own whims hawā in the past.”,{ فَٱسْتَجَابَ لَهُمْ رَبُّهُمْ أَنِّي لاَ أُضِيعُ عَمَلَ عَامِلٍ مِّنْكُمْ مِّن ذَكَرٍ أَوْ أُنْثَىٰ بَعْضُكُم مِّن بَعْضٍ فَٱلَّذِينَ هَاجَرُواْ وَأُخْرِجُواْ مِن دِيَـٰرِهِمْ وَأُوذُواْ فِي سَبِيلِي وَقَـٰتَلُواْ وَقُتِلُواْ لأُكَفِّرَنَّ عَنْهُمْ سَيِّئَاتِهِمْ وَلأُدْخِلَنَّهُمْ جَنَّـٰتٍ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلأَنْهَـٰرُ ثَوَاباً مِّن عِندِ ٱللَّهِ وَٱللَّهُ عِندَهُ حُسْنُ ٱلثَّوَابِ }
And their Lord answers them “I do not let the labor of any laborer among you go to waste be you male or female-the one of you is as the other: and those who emigrated and were expelled from their habitations those who suffered hurt in My way and fought and were slain-them I shall surely absolve of their evil deeds and I shall admit them to gardens underneath which rivers flow.” A reward from God! And God-with Him is the fairest reward. How would He not respond to them when He is the One who urges them to supplicate and He is the One who makes Himself responsible for answering themḍ The beautiful reward He has promised them exceeds what they pray for in their supplications. Those who emigrated [refers] to those [who forsake their] habitations and places of visitation mazār and all others aghyār whether they be in opposition or harmony. And were expelled from their habitations: they were forced to leave their familiar places and things. Those who suffered hurt in My way: they were condemned to poverty and blame malām and subjected to all kinds of trials and pains ālām. And fought and were slain: they tasted different stages the sweet and the bitter. Them I shall surely absolve of their evil deeds means “We will give them more than what they hoped for and more than what their acts and states merit.”,{ لاَ يَغُرَّنَّكَ تَقَلُّبُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ فِي ٱلْبِلاَدِ } * { مَتَاعٌ قَلِيلٌ ثُمَّ مَأْوَاهُمْ جَهَنَّمُ وَبِئْسَ ٱلْمِهَادُ }
Let it not delude you that the disbelievers go to and fro in the land a little enjoyment; then their abode is hell-an evil cradling! “Do not let any doubt seize you thinking that they have any value or worth with Us. Rather the days are few and breaths limited. Afterward there will be grief upon grief ḥasarāt mutarādifa and sorrow upon sorrow aḥzān mutaḌāʿifa.”,{ لاَ يَغُرَّنَّكَ تَقَلُّبُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ فِي ٱلْبِلاَدِ } * { مَتَاعٌ قَلِيلٌ ثُمَّ مَأْوَاهُمْ جَهَنَّمُ وَبِئْسَ ٱلْمِهَادُ }
Let it not delude you that the disbelievers go to and fro in the land a little enjoyment; then their abode is hell-an evil cradling! “Do not let any doubt seize you thinking that they have any value or worth with Us. Rather the days are few and breaths limited. Afterward there will be grief upon grief ḥasarāt mutarādifa and sorrow upon sorrow aḥzān mutaḌāʿifa.”,{ لَكِنِ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱتَّقَوْاْ رَبَّهُمْ لَهُمْ جَنَّاتٌ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلأَنْهَارُ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا نُزُلاً مِّنْ عِندِ ٱللَّهِ وَمَا عِندَ ٱللَّهِ خَيْرٌ لِّلأَبْرَارِ }
But those who fear their Lord-for them shall be gardens underneath which rivers flow abiding therein; a hospitality from God Himself. That which is with God is better for the pious. “The state of those whom we have branded with the ignominy of separation is wretched while the state and intimacy of those whom We have raised in degrees for Our sake is blessed.” They attain the lasting reward waṣalū ilā l-thawābi al-muqīm and remain in communion and felicity wa-baqū fī l-wuṣlati wa-l-naʿīm. What God has stored away for them is better than what they had hoped for by their own choosing.,{ وَإِنَّ مِنْ أَهْلِ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ لَمَن يُؤْمِنُ بِٱللَّهِ وَمَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكُمْ وَمَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْهِمْ خَٰشِعِينَ للَّهِ لاَ يَشْتَرُونَ بِآيَـٰتِ ٱللَّهِ ثَمَناً قَلِيلاً أُوْلـٰئِكَ لَهُمْ أَجْرُهُمْ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ سَرِيعُ ٱلْحِسَابِ }
Verily there are some among the people of the scripture who believe in God and what has been revealed to you and what has been revealed to them humble before God not purchasing with the verses of God a small price. Those-their wage is with their Lord. God is swift at reckoning. He means those who have been favored by a beautiful destiny-they are with the friends of God in being blessed fa-hum maʿa awliyāÌ Allāh niʿmatan just as they are with them in their destiny kamā kānū maʿahum qismatan.,{ يَا أَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ ٱصْبِرُواْ وَصَابِرُواْ وَرَابِطُواْ وَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ }
O you who believe be patient and vie in patience be steadfast; fear God so that you will prosper. Patience ṣabr relates to the servant alone. Vying in patience muṣābara is with the enemy. Being steadfast ribāṬ is a type of patience with a particular objective. It is said that the beginning of patience is acting as if one were patient taṣabbur. Then it is being patient ṣabr then vying in patience muṣābara then [achieving] the utmost patience iṣṬibār. It is said “Be patient by [performing] acts of obedience Ṭāʿāt and refraining from disobedient acts mukhālafāt; vie in patience by leav- ing whims and desires shahawāt and cutting off desire and attachments ʿalāqāt; and be steadfast by holding to the path of companionship in all times awqāt and states ḥālāt.” It is said “Be patient with your lower selves vie in patience with your hearts and be steadfast with your innermost selves.” It is said “Be patient looking to the reward vie in patience by desiring nearness and be steadfast in the place of proximity and nearness upon the witnessing of the [divine] beauty and might.” The taste of patience is bitter when the servant gulps it in [the state of] absence. Its taste is pleasant when it is drunk in witnessing and vision. Fear God so you will prosper: Prosperity is the conquering of desire. Their aspiration today is to gain victory over their lower selves for in that their deliverance will be complete. When they have defeated their lower selves they sacrifice them by the swords of [spiritual] effort mujāhada and crucify them on the trunks of toil mukābada. After their annihilation fanāÌ from their lower selves they will attain their subsistence baqāÌ through God.,{ يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّاسُ ٱتَّقُواْ رَبَّكُمُ ٱلَّذِي خَلَقَكُمْ مِّن نَّفْسٍ وَاحِدَةٍ وَخَلَقَ مِنْهَا زَوْجَهَا وَبَثَّ مِنْهُمَا رِجَالاً كَثِيراً وَنِسَآءً وَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ ٱلَّذِي تَسَآءَلُونَ بِهِ وَٱلأَرْحَامَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ عَلَيْكُمْ رَقِيباً }
O people fear your Lord who created you of a single soul and from it created its mate and from the pair of them scattered many men and women; and fear God by whom you claim [your rights] from one another and kinship ties. Surely God has been watchful over you. “People” al-nās is a generic noun whose etymology is uncertain. It is said that man al-ins is called ins because of his becoming visible ẓuhūr. Following this [etymology] the allusion ishāra is: “O you whom I have made appear from the concealment of nonexistence by the decree of My prescriptive command taklīfī I have chosen whom I will from among you for My honoring tashrīfī and deprived whom I will from among you of My guidance and giving of knowledge taʿrīfī. I have brought you to what- ever I will and have joined you to it by the decree of My free agency taṣrīfī.” It is said: “I did not cause anything else like you to appear from non- existence and [I] did not make appear to anyone else what I have made appear to you in your states.” [Following another etymology of the word “people” al-nās] it is said: “I named you “humankind” insān because of your forgetfulness nisyān. If you forget Me there is nothing of lesser value than you. But if you forget all that is other than me there is none who sees more clearly than you.” It is said that for the one who forgets the Real there is no limit to his tribulation man nasiya al-ḥaqqa fa-lā ghāyata li-miḥnatihi while for the one who forgets creation there is no end to the sublimity of his state wa- man nasiya al-khalqa fa-lā nihāyata li-ʿulūwi ḥālatihi. It is said: He says to the sinners “O you who have forgotten My cov- enant ʿahdī who have rejected My love waddī and ignored My limit ḥaddī now it is time for you to return to My door bābī so that you may lay claim to My kindness and approval ījābī.” He said to those with deeper knowledge “O you who in Us have forgotten your worldly portion ḥaẓẓaka and have kept your glance and expression laḥẓaka wa lafẓaka from any other-your rightful due ḥaqquka is magnified through Us. Helping you is made worthy with Us wajaba ladaynā naṣruka and your measure is exalted before Us wa-jalla ʿindanā qadruka.,{ وَآتُواْ ٱلْيَتَامَىٰ أَمْوَالَهُمْ وَلاَ تَتَبَدَّلُواْ ٱلْخَبِيثَ بِٱلطَّيِّبِ وَلاَ تَأْكُلُوۤاْ أَمْوَالَهُمْ إِلَىٰ أَمْوَالِكُمْ إِنَّهُ كَانَ حُوباً كَبِيراً }
Give the orphans their property and do not exchange the evil for the good and absorb not their property into your property; surely that is a great crime: Whoever has been given charge over others and then acts unjustly toward those under his charge his adversary is his Lord for He سبحانه avenges His servants what He will not avenge for His own sake. If the protector of the orphan acts with justice and beneficence then his right is protected by God and if he behaves badly and aggressively God is his adversary.,{ وَإِنْ خِفْتُمْ أَلاَّ تُقْسِطُواْ فِي ٱلْيَتَامَىٰ فَٱنكِحُواْ مَا طَابَ لَكُمْ مِّنَ ٱلنِّسَآءِ مَثْنَىٰ وَثُلَٰثَ وَرُبَٰعَ فَإِنْ خِفْتُمْ أَلاَّ تَعْدِلُواْ فَوَٰحِدَةً أَوْ مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَٰنُكُمْ ذٰلِكَ أَدْنَىٰ أَلاَّ تَعُولُواْ } * { وَءَاتُواْ ٱلنِّسَآءَ صَدُقَٰتِهِنَّ نِحْلَةً فَإِن طِبْنَ لَكُمْ عَن شَيْءٍ مِّنْهُ نَفْساً فَكُلُوهُ هَنِيئاً مَّرِيئاً }
If you fear that you will not act justly toward the orphans marry such women as seem good to you two or three or four but if you fear you will not be equitable then only one or what your right hands own; thus it is likelier that you will not be unjust. And give women their dowries as a free gift; God granted free men the right to marry four women at the same time. He mandated justice between [these wives] so the servant must respect what is obligatory. If he knows that he can uphold this obligation in a proper manner the choice is a permitted one. But if he knows that he will fall short in meeting this obligation he should not do it for he is accountable for what is obligatory. but if they are pleased to offer you any of it of their own accord consume it with wholesome appetite. This suggests that the food of the chivalrous fityān and generous askhiyāÌ is wholesome because they only feed others from good-hearted- ness. The food of the miserly is rotten because they look only to themselves and feed others out of obligation not good-heartedness. [The Prophet] ﷺ said “The food of the generous is a remedy while the food of the miser is a disease.”,{ وَإِنْ خِفْتُمْ أَلاَّ تُقْسِطُواْ فِي ٱلْيَتَامَىٰ فَٱنكِحُواْ مَا طَابَ لَكُمْ مِّنَ ٱلنِّسَآءِ مَثْنَىٰ وَثُلَٰثَ وَرُبَٰعَ فَإِنْ خِفْتُمْ أَلاَّ تَعْدِلُواْ فَوَٰحِدَةً أَوْ مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَٰنُكُمْ ذٰلِكَ أَدْنَىٰ أَلاَّ تَعُولُواْ } * { وَءَاتُواْ ٱلنِّسَآءَ صَدُقَٰتِهِنَّ نِحْلَةً فَإِن طِبْنَ لَكُمْ عَن شَيْءٍ مِّنْهُ نَفْساً فَكُلُوهُ هَنِيئاً مَّرِيئاً }

But do not give to the foolish your property which God has assigned to you as maintenance; provide for them thereof and clothe them and speak to them decent words. The foolish are those who keep you from the Real and distract you from the Lord. The foolish are those dependents and children who prefer their worldly portions over the rights of God most high. Which God has assigned to you as maintenance: To keep to pleasing actions in the situation is better for you than exposing yourself to disgrace petitioning begging and contriving. For the liberation of the heart it is better to be generous than withholding and [better] to rely on patience. But as for forming the intention to beg or making yourself and your dependents a burden on other people it is more appropriate to hold on to a sufficient amount from what God has assigned to you. Then you can be generous with what is in excess of your needs. Provide for them thereof and clothe them and speak to them decent words: If you have more than enough to help them today do not with- hold that which you know they need out of fear of future poverty. If your hand is constrained from providing support do not let your tongue loose in speaking ill. It is said that when your lower self calls you to spend in a useless way you are the most foolish of the foolish so do not yield to it.,{ وَٱبْتَلُواْ ٱلْيَتَامَىٰ حَتَّىٰ إِذَا بَلَغُواْ النِّكَاحَ فَإِنْ آنَسْتُمْ مِّنْهُمْ رُشْداً فَٱدْفَعُواْ إِلَيْهِمْ أَمْوَالَهُمْ وَلاَ تَأْكُلُوهَآ إِسْرَافاً وَبِدَاراً أَن يَكْبَرُواْ وَمَن كَانَ غَنِيّاً فَلْيَسْتَعْفِفْ وَمَن كَانَ فَقِيراً فَلْيَأْكُلْ بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ فَإِذَا دَفَعْتُمْ إِلَيْهِمْ أَمْوَالَهُمْ فَأَشْهِدُواْ عَلَيْهِمْ وَكَفَىٰ بِٱللَّهِ حَسِيباً }
Try well the orphans until they reach the age of marrying; then if you perceive in them maturity rushd deliver their property to them; consume it not wastefully and in haste lest they should grow up. If any man is rich let him be abstinent; if he is poor let him consume honorably. And when you deliver to them their property take witnesses over them. God suffices as a reckoner. To perceive maturity means [to perceive] decency and integrity. It is gen- erosity and the preservation of honor keeping company with elders and striving to look to the good and to perform acts of devotion as decreed by the command. It is said that the one who is mature rashīd is the one who is guided to his Lord. When a need arises in him he does not rely on his own power or strength his own planning or choosing.,{ لِّلرِّجَالِ نَصيِبٌ مِّمَّا تَرَكَ ٱلْوَالِدَانِ وَٱلأَقْرَبُونَ وَلِلنِّسَآءِ نَصِيبٌ مِّمَّا تَرَكَ ٱلْوَالِدَانِ وَٱلأَقْرَبُونَ مِمَّا قَلَّ مِنْهُ أَوْ كَثُرَ نَصِيباً مَّفْرُوضاً }
To the men belongs a share of what parents and kinsmen leave and to the women belongs a share of what parents and kinsmen leave whether it be little or much-an obligatory share. The determining of inheritance does not vary according to virtue or good qualities nor is it different due to fault defect or sin. If a man dies leav- ing two sons their rights are equivalent even if one of them is pious and God-fearing and the other wicked and disobedient. The God-fearing one does not get more because of his fear of God and the wicked one does not get less because of his wickedness. The deeper meaning in this is that inheritance is a gift from God that comes before [any action or virtue] so it is shared equally by the pious and the wicked. Likewise the determining of faith is a gift that comes before [any action or virtue] for Muslims. God most high said “Then We bequeathed the Book to those of Our servants whom We chose [35:32]. Then He said Yet some of them are those who wrong themselves and some of them are moderate and some are those who take the lead in [performing] good works by the leave of God. That is the greatest favor!” [35:32].,{ وَإِذَا حَضَرَ ٱلْقِسْمَةَ أُوْلُواْ ٱلْقُرْبَىٰ وَٱلْيَتَامَىٰ وَٱلْمَسَاكِينُ فَٱرْزُقُوهُمْ مِّنْهُ وَقُولُواْ لَهُمْ قَوْلاً مَّعْرُوفاً }
And when the division is attended by kinsmen and orphans and the poor grant them out of it; and speak to them honorable words. When the division of the inheritance is attended by those who are [to be] the possessors of its shares and are the legal heirs and others [also] attend who have no [legal] portion and who are poor do not deprive them of that. If the legal heir is a minor make to [the poor] a goodly promise saying to them “When the child grows up we will tell him to give you something.” This is the meaning of His words and speak to them honorable words. In this is a subtle allusion to those who have sinned. When they are present at His court in the future and the Real سبحانه pardons those who were obedient and gives them the rewards for their deeds He will not deprive the poor Muslims18 among you of the pardon if God wills after their having been among the family of faith ahl al-īmān. Similarly you were not present on the day of the division19-you have no prior entitlement. In what you know of [God] He has made you deserving ahhala20 by His favor in spite of His knowledge of the lapses that will occur in your states.,{ وَلْيَخْشَ ٱلَّذِينَ لَوْ تَرَكُواْ مِنْ خَلْفِهِمْ ذُرِّيَّةً ضِعَافاً خَافُواْ عَلَيْهِمْ فَلْيَتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَلْيَقُولُواْ قَوْلاً سَدِيداً }
And let them fear those who if they leave behind them weak offspring would be afraid for them; let them fear God and speak pertinent words. He explained in this verse that what the Muslim should accumulate for his dependents is not wealth but fear of God taqwā and righteousness ṣalāḥ for He did not say “so let them gather their wealth let them multiply real estate for them and let them leave behind household goods.” Rather He said let them fear God for He looks after the righteous.,{ إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يَأْكُلُونَ أَمْوَالَ ٱلْيَتَٰمَىٰ ظُلْماً إِنَّمَا يَأْكُلُونَ فِي بُطُونِهِمْ نَاراً وَسَيَصْلَوْنَ سَعِيراً }
Those who consume the property of orphans unjustly are only consum- ing fire in their bellies and they shall be exposed to a blaze. The Real سبحانه becomes the advocate for the orphan because there is no one other than Him for the orphan. Whoever hands his affair over to [God] and absolves himself of his own strength and power the Real سبحانه avenges him what He does not avenge for His own sake.,{ يُوصِيكُمُ ٱللَّهُ فِيۤ أَوْلَٰدِكُمْ لِلذَّكَرِ مِثْلُ حَظِّ ٱلأُنْثَيَيْنِ فَإِن كُنَّ نِسَآءً فَوْقَ ٱثْنَتَيْنِ فَلَهُنَّ ثُلُثَا مَا تَرَكَ وَإِن كَانَتْ وَاحِدَةً فَلَهَا ٱلنِّصْفُ وَلأَبَوَيْهِ لِكُلِّ وَاحِدٍ مِّنْهُمَا ٱلسُّدُسُ مِمَّا تَرَكَ إِن كَانَ لَهُ وَلَدٌ فَإِن لَّمْ يَكُنْ لَّهُ وَلَدٌ وَوَرِثَهُ أَبَوَاهُ فَلأُمِّهِ ٱلثُّلُثُ فَإِن كَانَ لَهُ إِخْوَةٌ فَلأُمِّهِ ٱلسُّدُسُ مِن بَعْدِ وَصِيَّةٍ يُوصِي بِهَآ أَوْ دَيْنٍ آبَآؤُكُمْ وَأَبناؤُكُمْ لاَ تَدْرُونَ أَيُّهُمْ أَقْرَبُ لَكُمْ نَفْعاً فَرِيضَةً مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ عَلِيماً حَكِيماً }
God charges you concerning your children to the male the equivalent of the portion of two females; and if they be women more than two then for them two-thirds of what he leaves; but if she be one then to her a half; and to his parents to each one of the two the sixth of what he leaves if he has a child; but if he has no child and his heirs are his parents then to his mother a third; or if he has siblings to his mother a sixth after any bequest that he may bequeath or any debt. The word “charge” waṣiyya here means “command” amr. He سبحانه established two principles for what is owed to inheritors from the inheri- tance-the obligatory portions farḌ and the inheritance by the group of relatives taʿṣīb. The inheritance by the group of relatives is stronger than the apportionment because it might include all of the wealth [of the estate] whereas the greater part of the portions cannot exceed two-thirds [of it]. The division [of the estate] begins with those who have claim to the ordained portions-those who have the weaker entitlement. Then [the division proceeds to] the group of relatives ʿaṣaba who have the stronger right. [The Prophet] ﷺ said “Whatever remains of the portions goes to the nearest male relative.” Thus is His way sunna forever. Likewise in the words of [God] most high “Then We bequeathed the Book to those of Our servants whom We chose” [35:32] He gave them the Book as the inheritance. Then He showed preference for the wrongdoer over those who take the lead [by beginning with them]. [The wrongdoer] has a weaker claim to put forth for generosity because he is broken-hearted and unable to withstand the prolonged deferral. To the male the equivalent of the portion of two females: If the matter were to be [determined] by analogy qiyās [with the previous examples where the weak are given preference] it would be more appropriate to favor the female because of her weakness and her inability to move about freely. But His determination سبحانه does not require justification ghayr al-muʿallal. Your parents and children-you know not which of them is nearer in benefit to you a prescription from God; surely God is ever Knowing Wise. Children benefit you with their service khidma and parents with their compassion raḥma-parents in the state of your weakness at the begin- ning of your life and children in your weakness at the end of your life.,{ وَلَكُمْ نِصْفُ مَا تَرَكَ أَزْوَٰجُكُمْ إِنْ لَّمْ يَكُنْ لَّهُنَّ وَلَدٌ فَإِن كَانَ لَهُنَّ وَلَدٌ فَلَكُمُ ٱلرُّبُعُ مِمَّا تَرَكْنَ مِن بَعْدِ وَصِيَّةٍ يُوصِينَ بِهَآ أَوْ دَيْنٍ وَلَهُنَّ ٱلرُّبُعُ مِمَّا تَرَكْتُمْ إِن لَّمْ يَكُنْ لَّكُمْ وَلَدٌ فَإِن كَانَ لَكُمْ وَلَدٌ فَلَهُنَّ ٱلثُّمُنُ مِمَّا تَرَكْتُم مِّن بَعْدِ وَصِيَّةٍ تُوصُونَ بِهَآ أَوْ دَيْنٍ وَإِن كَانَ رَجُلٌ يُورَثُ كَلَٰلَةً أَو ٱمْرَأَةٌ وَلَهُ أَخٌ أَوْ أُخْتٌ فَلِكُلِّ وَاحِدٍ مِّنْهُمَا ٱلسُّدُسُ فَإِن كَانُوۤاْ أَكْثَرَ مِن ذٰلِكَ فَهُمْ شُرَكَآءُ فِي ٱلثُّلُثِ مِن بَعْدِ وَصِيَّةٍ يُوصَىٰ بِهَآ أَوْ دَيْنٍ غَيْرَ مُضَآرٍّ وَصِيَّةً مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ حَلِيمٌ }
And for you a half of what your wives leave if they have no children; but if they have children then for you a fourth of what they leave after any bequest they may bequeath or any debt: a fourth of what you leave if you have no children; but if you have children then for them an eighth of what you leave after any bequest you may bequeath or any debt. If it be a man leaving an inheritance and not having a direct heir or it be a woman but it be that such has a brother or a sister then to each of the two a sixth; but if they be more than that then they share a third after any bequest to be bequeathed or any debt without prejudice; a charge from God. God is Knowing Forbearing. The subtle indication behind establishing inheritance for relatives by blood and marriage relates to the fact that the relative bears his grief when the individual dies. God compensates the heir for what he endures and soothes the ache in his heart with the inherited wealth. It is His way سبحانه to com- pensate for the suffering of the injured a generosity from Him-not an obligation on Him as some people imagine. All who were closest by blood or strongest by marital tie to the deceased are the most entitled to his inheritance. With regard to this meaning they have recited: No one remains possessed with cheerful largesse after the novelty is gone- except a youth still besotted.,{ تِلْكَ حُدُودُ ٱللَّهِ وَمَن يُطِعِ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ يُدْخِلْهُ جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلأَنْهَارُ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا وَذٰلِكَ ٱلْفَوْزُ ٱلْعَظِيمُ }
Those are God's bounds. Whoever obeys God and His Messenger He will admit him to gardens underneath which rivers flow abiding therein; that is the great triumph. His bounds ḥudūd are His commands and prohibitions and that by which His servants ʿibād show their devotion taʿabbada bihi. The root of ser- vanthood ʿubūdiyya is preserving the bounds ḥudūd and maintaining the promises ʿuhūd. Whoever preserves His limit nothing bad or harmful will reach him. The root of every affliction is going beyond the bounds.,{ وَمَن يَعْصِ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ وَيَتَعَدَّ حُدُودَهُ يُدْخِلْهُ نَاراً خَالِداً فِيهَا وَلَهُ عَذَابٌ مُّهِينٌ }
But whoever disobeys God and His Messenger; and transgresses His bounds him He will admit to a fire abiding therein and for him there shall be a humbling chastisement. There are indeed two punishments one immediate and one postponed and ignominy unites the two of them. If created beings were to attempt to debase those who are disobedient with the like of the debasement that has already come to them through their disobedience they would not be able to do it. Because of this their speaker said “Whoever spends the night committing a sin wakes up with his degradation wa-ʿalayhi madhallatuhu. But one says of one who wakes up and passes the day performing pious acts that he has his dignity wa-ʿalayhi mahābatuhu.”,{ وَٱللاَّتِي يَأْتِينَ ٱلْفَٰحِشَةَ مِن نِّسَآئِكُمْ فَٱسْتَشْهِدُواْ عَلَيْهِنَّ أَرْبَعةً مِّنْكُمْ فَإِن شَهِدُواْ فَأَمْسِكُوهُنَّ فِي ٱلْبُيُوتِ حَتَّىٰ يَتَوَفَّاهُنَّ ٱلْمَوْتُ أَوْ يَجْعَلَ ٱللَّهُ لَهُنَّ سَبِيلاً }
As for those of your women who commit lewdness call four of you to witness against them; and if they witness then detain them in their houses until death take them or God appoints for them a way. So as to lower the veil of generosity over the sins of servants [God] made allowances through an excessive number of witnesses [required] to estab- lish proof of lewdness which is fornication. To follow the witnessing pro- cedure in the law makes establishing proof of the circumstances nearly impossible. When Māʿiz [ibn Mālik] told [the Prophet] ﷺ “O Messenger of God may the blessings of God be upon you I have committed fornication” he said “Maybe you [only] kissedḍ” On another occasion [the Prophet] said “smell his breath.” In this there is the strongest proof of what I have mentioned of the lowering of the veil over ugly acts.,{ وَٱللَّذَانِ يَأْتِيَانِهَا مِنكُمْ فَآذُوهُمَا فَإِن تَابَا وَأَصْلَحَا فَأَعْرِضُواْ عَنْهُمَآ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ تَوَّاباً رَّحِيماً }
And when two of you commit it punish them both; but if they repent and make amends then leave them be. God ever turns [relenting] and is Merciful. The command to various modes of punishment for those who do this act is the strongest way to kindly communicate [the advice] to prevent and stay away from it so that the servant might be on his guard and not become deserving of the greater punishment.,{ إِنَّمَا ٱلتَّوْبَةُ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ لِلَّذِينَ يَعْمَلُونَ ٱلسُّوۤءَ بِجَهَالَةٍ ثُمَّ يَتُوبُونَ مِن قَرِيبٍ فَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ يَتُوبُ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْهِمْ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ عَلِيماً حَكِيماً }
The repentance that God accepts is only of those who do evil in igno- rance; then repent shortly thereafter; God will relent to those. And God is ever Knowing Wise. There is no asking for forgiveness while one persists [in doing evil] for surely repentance without desisting is the sign of a liar. Evil in ignorance means doing what the ignorant do. The sin of each person is in accordance with his state. The sins of the elite are their thoughts that they are entitled to a certain place maḥall or special gift karāma because of their acts of obedience. This is a feeble stance to take since there is no way to Him except through Him. Then repent shortly thereafter: According to what the scholars say this means before death. In terms of moral behavior lisān al-muʿāmala it means before your lower self becomes habituated to that [sin] so that it becomes a habit. Their speaker said: I said to the lower self “If you want to return return before the way is blocked.”,{ وَلَيْسَتِ ٱلتَّوْبَةُ لِلَّذِينَ يَعْمَلُونَ ٱلسَّيِّئَاتِ حَتَّىٰ إِذَا حَضَرَ أَحَدَهُمُ ٱلْمَوْتُ قَالَ إِنِّي تُبْتُ ٱلآنَ وَلاَ ٱلَّذِينَ يَمُوتُونَ وَهُمْ كُفَّارٌ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ أَعْتَدْنَا لَهُمْ عَذَاباً أَلِيماً }
Repentance is not for those who do evil deeds until when death approaches one of them he says “Indeed now I repent”; neither for those who die disbelieving. Those-We have prepared for them a painful chastisement. This means that when the covering has been removed and the different kinds of knowledge are self-evident Ḍarūriyya the door to repentance is closed. A condition of the prescriptive command taklīf is that faith be placed in what is unseen. Moreover once one has confessed to being disloyal on this path there is no smelling the truth of sincerity after that. When God most high asked David عليه السلام as his crying was subsiding “Why are you crying Davidḍ I have already forgiven you. I have placated your opponent and have accepted your repentance.” He said “My God give me back the moment which was mine.” [God] said “O David what an idea! That [moment] has passed.” About its meaning they have recited: Let the eyes after you weep for there is no return to the days of joy.,{ يَٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ لاَ يَحِلُّ لَكُمْ أَن تَرِثُواْ ٱلنِّسَآءَ كَرْهاً وَلاَ تَعْضُلُوهُنَّ لِتَذْهَبُواْ بِبَعْضِ مَآ ءَاتَيْتُمُوهُنَّ إِلاَّ أَن يَأْتِينَ بِفَٰحِشَةٍ مُّبَيِّنَةٍ وَعَاشِرُوهُنَّ بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ فَإِن كَرِهْتُمُوهُنَّ فَعَسَىٰ أَن تَكْرَهُواْ شَيْئاً وَيَجْعَلَ ٱللَّهُ فِيهِ خَيْراً كَثِيراً }
O you who believe it is not lawful for you to inherit women against their will; neither debar them so that you may go off with part of what you have given them except when they commit flagrant lewdness. Consort with them in kindness; for if you hate them it may happen that you hate a thing wherein God has set much good. To deceive those who are vulnerable al-talbīs ʿalā l-mustaḌʿafīn and to cheat innocent and peaceable Muslims wa-l-tadlīs ʿalā ahli al-salāmati wa-l-widāʿati min al-muslimīn is not praiseworthy before God who will take revenge on those who engage in this. He will not bless them in what they have taken for themselves through deception and trickery from other people's wealth. Whoever deems the other party insignificant before God- the very least punishment God will enact on him will be to hold him back from reaching what he hopes for and loves. Consort with them in kindness: that is according to the teachings of the religion behaving in the best manner taÌaddub with the noble traits akhlāq of those who submit and keeping good company in spite of any dislikes of the lower self. It [means] that you tolerate any offense on their part that you do not burden them with serving you and that you shut your eyes to the occasions of their embarrassment. For if you hate them it may happen that you hate a thing...: That which is most difficult for the lower self [in the beginning] brings the most joy and is the most pleasant in the end. Knowthatthe Realسبحانهhasnotshownanyonewhatis unseen. Humankind [does not understand] that most of what they feel an aversion to has more good than not in it. God سبحانه has decreed that opposition to the lower self will bring its master to a higher station while the reverse will be the case for those who align themselves with [their lower selves]. Opposition to the heart [that is the higher self] leads to the blindness of the faculty of insight while the reverse will be the case for those who align themselves with [the heart].,{ وَإِنْ أَرَدْتُّمُ ٱسْتِبْدَالَ زَوْجٍ مَّكَانَ زَوْجٍ وَآتَيْتُمْ إِحْدَاهُنَّ قِنْطَاراً فَلاَ تَأْخُذُواْ مِنْهُ شَيْئاً أَتَأْخُذُونَهُ بُهْتَاناً وَإِثْماً مُّبِيناً }
And if you desire to exchange a wife in place of another and you have given to one a hundredweight take of it nothing. Would you take it by way of calumny and manifest sinḍ He taught them how to best keep to the promise and noble behavior in the conjugal relationship saying do not combine the act of separation with the demand for the return of your wealth for surely that is ignoble. If you have given a woman a great deal of wealth and then treat her harshly by separating from her what you have given her is insignificant next to what you have made her experience.,{ وَكَيْفَ تَأْخُذُونَهُ وَقَدْ أَفْضَىٰ بَعْضُكُمْ إِلَىٰ بَعْضٍ وَأَخَذْنَ مِنكُم مِّيثَٰقاً غَلِيظاً }
How shall you take it when each of you has been privily with the other and they have taken from you a solemn covenant. It means that the prior companionship has a firm inviolability so out of respect to its due stop and keep to what the covenant requires.,{ وَلاَ تَنكِحُواْ مَا نَكَحَ ءَابَآؤُكُمْ مِّنَ ٱلنِّسَآءِ إِلاَّ مَا قَدْ سَلَفَ إِنَّهُ كَانَ فَاحِشَةً وَمَقْتاً وَسَآءَ سَبِيلاً }
And do not marry women whom your fathers married unless it be a thing of the past; surely that is obscene and abominable an evil way. This verse alludes to the protection of honor and staying within the limits of respect. If it is natural for a man to hate that another should bed his wife then sons should be forbidden from disregarding the rights of their fathers in seeking to bed their [fathers'] wives.,{ حُرِّمَتْ عَلَيْكُمْ أُمَّهَٰتُكُمْ وَبَنَٰتُكُمْ وَأَخَوَٰتُكُمْ وَعَمَّٰتُكُمْ وَخَالَٰتُكُمْ وَبَنَاتُ ٱلأَخِ وَبَنَاتُ ٱلأُخْتِ وَأُمَّهَٰتُكُمُ الَّٰتِي أَرْضَعْنَكُمْ وَأَخَوَٰتُكُم مِّنَ ٱلرَّضَٰعَةِ وَأُمَّهَٰتُ نِسَآئِكُمْ وَرَبَائِبُكُمُ ٱلَّٰتِي فِي حُجُورِكُمْ مِّن نِّسَآئِكُمُ ٱلَّٰتِي دَخَلْتُمْ بِهِنَّ فَإِن لَّمْ تَكُونُواْ دَخَلْتُمْ بِهِنَّ فَلاَ جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ وَحَلَٰئِلُ أَبْنَائِكُمُ ٱلَّذِينَ مِنْ أَصْلَٰبِكُمْ وَأَن تَجْمَعُواْ بَيْنَ ٱلأُخْتَيْنِ إِلاَّ مَا قَدْ سَلَفَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ غَفُوراً رَّحِيماً }
Forbidden to you are your mothers and daughters your sisters your paternal aunts and maternal aunts your brother's daughters your sister's daughters your foster mothers who have given you milk your foster sisters your mothers-in-law your step-daughters who are in your care being born of your wives you have been in to-but if you have not yet been in to them you are not at fault-and the spouses of your sons who are of your loins and that you should take to you two sisters together unless it be a thing of the past. God is ever Forgiving Merciful. The attempt to find the meanings behind the prohibitions is an impossible matter because the law does not need to be justified ghayr al-muʿallal. Rather the Real سبحانه prohibits what He will for whom He will and likewise gives permission. There is no underlying cause ʿilla for the laws at all: if the prohibited women were to be the permissible ones or the permissible women were to be the prohibited ones then that would be allowed.,{ وَٱلْمُحْصَنَٰتُ مِنَ ٱلنِّسَآءِ إِلاَّ مَا مَلَكْتَ أَيْمَٰنُكُمْ كِتَٰبَ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ وَأُحِلَّ لَكُمْ مَّا وَرَاءَ ذَٰلِكُمْ أَن تَبْتَغُواْ بِأَمْوَٰلِكُمْ مُّحْصِنِينَ غَيْرَ مُسَٰفِحِينَ فَمَا ٱسْتَمْتَعْتُمْ بِهِ مِنْهُنَّ فَآتُوهُنَّ أُجُورَهُنَّ فَرِيضَةً وَلاَ جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ فِيمَا تَرَٰضَيْتُمْ بِهِ مِن بَعْدِ ٱلْفَرِيضَةِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ عَلِيماً حَكِيماً }
And wedded women save what your right hands own this is what God has prescribed for you. Lawful for you beyond all that is that you seek using your wealth in wedlock and not illicitly. Such wives as you enjoy thereby give them their wages as an obligation; you are not at fault in agreeing together after the obligation. God is ever Knowing Wise. When you stay mindful of the limits ḥudūd respect agreements ʿuhūd and obtain mutual consent with women33 according to the law there will be no enmity in it for people and no punishment to follow from it from the Real سبحانه for that is lawful and without further restriction.,{ وَمَن لَّمْ يَسْتَطِعْ مِنكُمْ طَوْلاً أَن يَنكِحَ ٱلْمُحْصَنَٰتِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنَٰتِ فَمِنْ مَّا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَٰنُكُم مِّن فَتَيَٰتِكُمُ ٱلْمُؤْمِنَٰتِ وَٱللَّهُ أَعْلَمُ بِإِيمَٰنِكُمْ بَعْضُكُمْ مِّن بَعْضٍ فَٱنكِحُوهُنَّ بِإِذْنِ أَهْلِهِنَّ وَآتُوهُنَّ أُجُورَهُنَّ بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ مُحْصَنَٰتٍ غَيْرَ مُسَٰفِحَٰتٍ وَلاَ مُتَّخِذَٰتِ أَخْدَانٍ فَإِذَآ أُحْصِنَّ فَإِنْ أَتَيْنَ بِفَٰحِشَةٍ فَعَلَيْهِنَّ نِصْفُ مَا عَلَى ٱلْمُحْصَنَٰتِ مِنَ ٱلْعَذَابِ ذَلِكَ لِمَنْ خَشِيَ ٱلْعَنَتَ مِنْكُمْ وَأَن تَصْبِرُواْ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ }
And whoever has not the means wherewith to be able to marry believing women in wedlock let him take believing maids whom your right hands own. God knows very well your faith; the one of you is as the other. So marry them with the permission of their folk and give them their wages honorably as women in wedlock not illicitly or taking lovers. But when they are given in wedlock if they commit lewdness they shall be liable to half the chastisement of married women. That is for those of you who fear the distress of sin yet it is better for you to be patient. God is Forgiving Merciful. Concessions have been granted for the weak. As for the strong He bids them to serious endeavor and the adoption of what is most comprehen- sive and restrictive in the law since there is no work for them except to uphold the right of the Real ḥaqq al-ḥaqq. When an external matter distracts them from their attention to the heart so that they adopt what is easier and less this takes them farther away from their attention to the innermost self for it is an abandonment of the most important and sublime matters. Whoever descends in degree from adopting that which is strongest and most comprehensive-[this decline] to what is permissible for him [is actually] a decline into the state of indulgence. Then He said at the end of the verse yet it is better for you to be patient. This means [patient] in enduring what is difficult in [your situation]. This is a soothing way [of speaking] to the servant since He did not say “Be patient” but rather yet it is better for you to be patient.,{ يُرِيدُ ٱللَّهُ لِيُبَيِّنَ لَكُمْ وَيَهْدِيَكُمْ سُنَنَ ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ وَيَتُوبَ عَلَيْكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ حَكِيمٌ }
God desires to make clear to you and to guide you in the ways of those before you and to turn [in forgiveness] toward you; God is Knowing Wise. When He told the Prophet ﷺ and his community the stories of those from past communities and what they did and how they were dealt with they looked to what would be done with them since there were among them those who also did the impermissible. So they said “If only we knew in what way [God] will deal with us. Will it be abasement metamorphosis35 punishment or whatḍ” So God most high said and to guide you in the ways of those before you We will inform you of that which we did with them and to turn [in forgiveness] toward you. As for you I turn [in forgiveness] to you and as for those who came before you I have already destroyed them utterly. It is said that God desires to make clear to you by unveiling His secrets to you so that what was hidden from others will be made manifest to you. It is said that God desires to make clear to you His singularity in bring- ing things into existence and originating new things-no one else has any part in this. And to guide you in the ways of those before you: the path of the prophets and the friends. This [guidance] is entrusting [everything to God] being content and surrendering completely to the [divine] decree and judgment. It is said: And to turn [in forgiveness] toward you that is He accepts your repentance after having created it and then repays you according to what He has created for you in your repentance.,{ وَٱللَّهُ يُرِيدُ أَن يَتُوبَ عَلَيْكُمْ وَيُرِيدُ ٱلَّذِينَ يَتَّبِعُونَ ٱلشَّهَوَاتِ أَن تَمِيلُواْ مَيْلاً عَظِيماً } * { يُرِيدُ ٱللَّهُ أَن يُخَفِّفَ عَنْكُمْ وَخُلِقَ ٱلإِنسَانُ ضَعِيفاً }
And God desires to turn [forgivingly] toward you but those who follow their passions desire that you deviate with a terrible deviation. God desires to lighten things for you; for man was created weak. He separates here the story of the former from the story of the latter. Whenever God desires to turn toward someone He will not let an enemy gloat over him and He will not give him anything bad in the two abodes. But those who follow their passions shahawāt desire...: Their desire irāda becomes weak enfeebled and held back before the desire irāda of the Real سبحانه. God desires to lighten things for you. This means [the lightening of] the weight of litanies37 through intermittent incomings wāridāt to your hearts. It is said that God desires to lighten what you endure in struggles mujāhadāt with the lights of witnessings mushāhadāt that enter deeply into your hearts. It is said that God desires to lighten the burdens of service for you with the sweetness of acts of obedience. It is said that He lightens the difficulties of the trust amāna for you by carrying its burden for you. It is said that He lightens the hardships of seeking with the refreshment of arriving. For man was created weak: He describes by this their need and affliction Ḍurr but does not accept40 by this their excuse ʿudhr.,{ وَٱللَّهُ يُرِيدُ أَن يَتُوبَ عَلَيْكُمْ وَيُرِيدُ ٱلَّذِينَ يَتَّبِعُونَ ٱلشَّهَوَاتِ أَن تَمِيلُواْ مَيْلاً عَظِيماً } * { يُرِيدُ ٱللَّهُ أَن يُخَفِّفَ عَنْكُمْ وَخُلِقَ ٱلإِنسَانُ ضَعِيفاً }

O you who believe consume not your goods between you wrongly except it be trading through mutual agreement. And kill not yourselves. Surely God is ever Merciful to you. And whoever does that through aggression and injustice him We shall certainly expose to a fire; and that for God is an easy matter. Every thing spent for something other than God is capital spent for nothing. It is said that [this refers] to withholding in a heedless way and expend- ing from a place other than that of bearing witness to the true reality ḥaqīqa. All of that comes to nothing. And kill not yourselves that is by committing sins. It is said that it is an indirect reference to those things that would incur His wrath سبحانه. It is said [kill not yourselves] by looking to and paying mind to [your lower selves]. It is said [kill not yourselves] by being pleased with [your lower selves] or giving preference to them over the good pleasure of the Real. And whoever does that through aggression and injustice We will not spare him from a fierce punishment. We will entrust [the fire] with its rightful inhabitant nakilahā ilā ṣāḥibihā and give it free rein wa-nalqā ḥablahā ʿalā ghāribihā.,{ يَٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ لاَ تَأْكُلُوۤاْ أَمْوَٰلَكُمْ بَيْنَكُمْ بِٱلْبَٰطِلِ إِلاَّ أَن تَكُونَ تِجَٰرَةً عَن تَرَاضٍ مِّنْكُمْ وَلاَ تَقْتُلُوۤاْ أَنْفُسَكُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ بِكُمْ رَحِيماً } * { وَمَن يَفْعَلْ ذٰلِكَ عُدْوَاناً وَظُلْماً فَسَوْفَ نُصْلِيهِ نَاراً وَكَانَ ذٰلِكَ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ يَسِيراً }

If you avoid the grave sins that are forbidden you We will absolve you of your evil deeds and admit you by an honorable gate. The grave sins here according to scholars are those of associating partners with God shirk. According to the explanation by allusion bayān al-ishāra they [also] include acts of hidden idolatry. Included within this is paying heed to creatures seeking the pleasure of their acceptance courting their affection and shutting one's eyes to the right and reality ḥaqq of God because of them. It is said that once one commits to the covenant one is safe from being charged with disbelief because of transgressions. It is said that the worst of the grave sins is for you to affirm your lower self nafs. When you have experienced its negation you will be delivered from the captivity of tribulations. We will admit you in your affairs and states by an honorable gate [that is] a beautiful admission. You will no longer see your comings and goings as being from yourselves but rather you will see the One who has free disposal muṣarrif over your affairs.,{ وَلاَ تَتَمَنَّوْاْ مَا فَضَّلَ ٱللَّهُ بِهِ بَعْضَكُمْ عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ لِّلرِّجَالِ نَصِيبٌ مِّمَّا ٱكْتَسَبُواْ وَلِلنِّسَآءِ نَصِيبٌ مِّمَّا ٱكْتَسَبْنَ وَٱسْأَلُواْ ٱللَّهَ مِن فَضْلِهِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عَلِيماً }
Do not covet that in which God has preferred some of you above oth- ers. To men a share from what they have earned and to women a share from what they have earned. And ask God of His bounty; God is ever Knower of all things. In terms of one's moral behavior lisān al-muʿālama the command is to toil not covet. In terms of declaring God's unity lisān al-tawḥīd the command is to the [divine] decree and judgment not [human] desire and wants. It is said “Travel the road of those who precede you in upholding the right of God but do not demand to obtain what they have been selected for from the favor of God. Concern yourselves with the right of your Protector mawlākum not with following your personal whims hawākum and preferring what you desire munākum.” It is said “do not covet the station of [spiritual] masters without travel- ing their paths cleaving to their course and doing what they do for this way of thinking [that is coveting] is an outrageous deviation from what is right.” It is said “Be a seeker of [God's] rights not a seeker of your portion or your rights. For if you seek the portion you wish for yourself in this world or the next you have unconsciously added partners to your profes- sion of God's unity.” It is said “do not covet stations of men for each has a station appropriate before God.” There are only so many [men with stations] and until someone has died his place will not be inherited by another. God most high said “He has made you successors” [6:165 35:39] and the successor is the one who succeeds the one who came before him. If you covet the station of one of the friends [of God] it is as if you are seeking to hasten his passing in all or in part of what you covet and this is not a harmless attitude. It is said that your extinction beneath the streams of His decree accord- ing to what has already been established by His choice is more fortunate for you than [your] seeking to obtain your desires since your ruin may lie in the object of your desire. It is said that if one's outward nature has not been refined through the different kinds of moral behavior muʿāmalāt one's inward nature has [likewise] not been refined by the different aspects of the mutual waystations munāzalāt.,{ وَلِكُلٍّ جَعَلْنَا مَوَٰلِيَ مِمَّا تَرَكَ ٱلْوَٰلِدَانِ وَٱلأَقْرَبُونَ وَٱلَّذِينَ عَقَدَتْ أَيْمَٰنُكُمْ فَآتُوهُمْ نَصِيبَهُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ شَهِيداً }
To each We have appointed heirs of that which parents and kinsmen leave and to those to whom your right hands were pledged. So give them their share. God is ever Witness over everything. In the beginning of Islam He made relationships by mutual commitment the equal of relationships of kin in determining inheritance. While this ruling was later abrogated the rule to respect [one another] remained. If this is the manner of relationships by mutual commitment muʿāqada between men what do you think of the mutual covenant muʿāhada with Godḍ God most high said “men who are true to the covenant they made with God” [33:23]. They have recited: Verily those who have died to the religion of whims find the decree of death a sweet watering place.,{ ٱلرِّجَالُ قَوَّٰمُونَ عَلَى ٱلنِّسَآءِ بِمَا فَضَّلَ ٱللَّهُ بَعْضَهُمْ عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ وَبِمَآ أَنْفَقُواْ مِنْ أَمْوَٰلِهِمْ فَٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتُ قَٰنِتَٰتٌ حَٰفِظَٰتٌ لِّلْغَيْبِ بِمَا حَفِظَ ٱللَّهُ وَٱلَّٰتِي تَخَافُونَ نُشُوزَهُنَّ فَعِظُوهُنَّ وَٱهْجُرُوهُنَّ فِي ٱلْمَضَاجِعِ وَٱضْرِبُوهُنَّ فَإِنْ أَطَعْنَكُمْ فَلاَ تَبْغُواْ عَلَيْهِنَّ سَبِيلاً إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ عَلِيّاً كَبِيراً }
Men are in charge of women because of that with which God has preferred the one over the other and because of what they expend of their property. Therefore righteous women are obedient guarding in the unseen because of what God has guarded. And those you fear may be rebellious admonish them and share not beds with them and strike them. If they then obey you do not seek a way against them. God is ever High Great. He distinguished men by their strength and then increased their burden for the burden is in accordance with [one's] strength. The lesson is to be taken through hearts and aspirations not through the lower selves and bodies. And those you fear may be rebellious admonish them and share not beds with them and strike them: that is increase your correction of them gradually and with kindness for if the matter can be reconciled with admonition there is no need to use the rod to strike. The verse contains the good manners ādāb of spousal companionship. Then He said “If they then obey you do not seek a way against them.” [This] means if she stops acting in a way that is injurious to the relation- ship and returns to obedience do not seek revenge on her for what has happened in the past. Do not withhold your acceptance of her excuse and do not be unyielding toward her. It is said do not seek a way against them in going beyond the measure of what you deem necessary out of spite.,{ وَإِنْ خِفْتُمْ شِقَاقَ بَيْنِهِمَا فَٱبْعَثُواْ حَكَماً مِّنْ أَهْلِهِ وَحَكَماً مِّنْ أَهْلِهَآ إِن يُرِيدَآ إِصْلَٰحاً يُوَفِّقِ ٱللَّهُ بَيْنَهُمَآ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ عَلِيماً خَبِيراً }
And if you fear a breach between the two send forth an arbiter from his folk and an arbiter from her folk if they desire to set things right God will grant them success. Surely God is ever Knower Aware. It is said that you have the right to her obedience in terms of the body but as for love and inclination toward you in the heart that is up to God. So do not burden her with what God has not provided for you from her. Hearts are in the power of God and He causes love within them toward whom He will and makes them hate whom He will. It is said that if they then obey you do not seek a way against them that is do not forget her loyalty in the past because of a single incident of antipa- thy in the present for perhaps the situation will become amicable again.,{ وَٱعْبُدُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَلاَ تُشْرِكُواْ بِهِ شَيْئاً وَبِٱلْوَٰلِدَيْنِ إِحْسَاناً وَبِذِي ٱلْقُرْبَىٰ وَٱلْيَتَٰمَىٰ وَٱلْمَسَٰكِينِ وَٱلْجَارِ ذِي ٱلْقُرْبَىٰ وَٱلْجَارِ ٱلْجُنُبِ وَٱلصَّاحِبِ بِٱلجَنْبِ وَٱبْنِ ٱلسَّبِيلِ وَمَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَٰنُكُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لاَ يُحِبُّ مَن كَانَ مُخْتَالاً فَخُوراً } * { ٱلَّذِينَ يَبْخَلُونَ وَيَأْمُرُونَ ٱلنَّاسَ بِٱلْبُخْلِ وَيَكْتُمُونَ مَآ آتَاهُمُ ٱللَّهُ مِن فَضْلِهِ وَأَعْتَدْنَا لِلْكَافِرِينَ عَذَاباً مُّهِيناً }
And worship God and associate nothing with Him. Be kind to parents and near kindred and to orphans and to the needy and to the neighbor who is near and to the neighbor who is a stranger and to the friend at your side and to the wayfarer and to what your right hands own. Surely God loves not the conceited and the boastful. Those who are niggardly and bid other people to be niggardly and conceal what God has bestowed upon them of His bounty. And We have prepared for those that disbelieve a humbling chastisement. And worship God: Servanthood is attaching yourself closely to the com- mand al-ʿubūdiyyatu muʿānaqatu al-amr and separating yourself from the rebuke wa-mufāraqatu al-zajr. And associate nothing with Him: The outward form of associating another with God shirk is to believe in objects of worship other than Him iʿtiqādu maʿbūdin siwāhi while its hidden form is looking to any existing thing other than Him mulāḥaẓatu mawjūdin siwāhi. Declaring His unity is to recognize that all contingent things are brought into being by God and subsist through Him. He is the One who causes things to happen brings things forth and causes them to remain. There is not an atom a splinter a particle or the slightest trace that belongs to anyone [other than Him that has the capacity to] bring things into existence or orginate new things. The subtle forms of showing off the hidden acts of guile the secret places of pride acting to be seen by created beings seeking the pleasure of their praise and wilting at their rejection and censure-all that is hidden idolatry shirk khafī. Be kind to parents: Acting kindly iḥsān follows degrees of association for you have been commanded to observe [your parents'] rights first because they are your kin and you were raised by them and reached your full maturity and knowledge through them. When your association and companionship have become sound and good with your near kindred the poor the needy the orphans and those of their class you will be raised up from that to become worthy of His companionship سبحانه. And to the neighbor who is near and to the neighbor who is a stranger and to the friend at your side: Among your neighbors are your two angels so do not annoy them with your disobedience bi-ʿiṣyānika and observe their right in what you give them to record in your acts of kindness min iḥsānika.,{ وَٱعْبُدُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَلاَ تُشْرِكُواْ بِهِ شَيْئاً وَبِٱلْوَٰلِدَيْنِ إِحْسَاناً وَبِذِي ٱلْقُرْبَىٰ وَٱلْيَتَٰمَىٰ وَٱلْمَسَٰكِينِ وَٱلْجَارِ ذِي ٱلْقُرْبَىٰ وَٱلْجَارِ ٱلْجُنُبِ وَٱلصَّاحِبِ بِٱلجَنْبِ وَٱبْنِ ٱلسَّبِيلِ وَمَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَٰنُكُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لاَ يُحِبُّ مَن كَانَ مُخْتَالاً فَخُوراً } * { ٱلَّذِينَ يَبْخَلُونَ وَيَأْمُرُونَ ٱلنَّاسَ بِٱلْبُخْلِ وَيَكْتُمُونَ مَآ آتَاهُمُ ٱللَّهُ مِن فَضْلِهِ وَأَعْتَدْنَا لِلْكَافِرِينَ عَذَاباً مُّهِيناً }

And those who expend of their substance to show off to people and believe not in God and the Last Day. Whoever has Satan for a comrade then an evil comrade has he. These are also included in His words “surely God loves not the conceited and the boastful fakhūr” [4:36]. Their immediate punishment is that they are not in the group of those whom He loves. That is tribulation enough. The conceited are those who look to themselves while those who show off look to others like them. Both of them are branded by hidden idolatry shirk khafī and God does not love those who associate others with Him. Among camels the fakhūr is a she-camel in the flock whose teats are blocked so that a large amount of milk collects in the udder. The buyer thinks that that is normal for her but it is not so. Likewise anyone who looks only to himself and his standing in the present moment is making false claims-he is fakhūr and God does not love him. This is also the case for the one who expends his substance to show off to people.,{ وَمَاذَا عَلَيْهِمْ لَوْ آمَنُواْ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلآخِرِ وَأَنْفَقُواْ مِمَّا رَزَقَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ بِهِم عَلِيماً }
And what burden is on them if they were to believe in God and the Last Day and expend of what God has provided themḍ God is ever Aware of them. There is no difficulty for them in putting their faith and trust in God. Indeed if they were to have faith they would attain glorious honor in this world and the hereafter. Nothing prompts them to turn away from [God] but their lack of commitment and respect.,{ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لاَ يَظْلِمُ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ وَإِن تَكُ حَسَنَةً يُضَٰعِفْهَا وَيُؤْتِ مِن لَّدُنْهُ أَجْراً عَظِيماً }
Surely God shall not wrong so much as the weight of an atom; and if it be a good deed He will double it and give from Himself a great wage. He does not deprive them of anything in their reward but rather is first with his bounty for them without their having deserved [it] and He doubles the wages for their works. It is impossible to describe what [God] has decreed as wrongdoing because the creation is His creation and the kingdom is His kingdom. The wrongdoer is one who transgresses a limit which has been ordained for him-it is impossible to describe the glory of [God's] sublime measure in this way.,{ فَكَيْفَ إِذَا جِئْنَا مِن كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ بِشَهِيدٍ وَجِئْنَا بِكَ عَلَىٰ هَـٰؤُلاۤءِ شَهِيداً } * { يَوْمَئِذٍ يَوَدُّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَعَصَوُاْ ٱلرَّسُولَ لَوْ تُسَوَّىٰ بِهِمُ ٱلأَرْضُ وَلاَ يَكْتُمُونَ ٱللَّهَ حَدِيثاً }
So how shall it be when We bring forward from every community a witness; and We bring you as witness against theseḍ Upon that day the disbelievers those who have disobeyed the Messenger will wish that the earth might be leveled with them. And they will not hide from God any talk. Since the Messenger ﷺ will be the witness against his community as well as their intercessor he will only bear witness to that which can be the object of [his] intercession. Upon that day the disbelievers... They will become remorseful but it will not benefit them. They will bite their fingertips but their anguish will not subside. They will be wrapped in the veil of ignominy and transferred to the homesteads of tribulation and adversity.,{ فَكَيْفَ إِذَا جِئْنَا مِن كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ بِشَهِيدٍ وَجِئْنَا بِكَ عَلَىٰ هَـٰؤُلاۤءِ شَهِيداً } * { يَوْمَئِذٍ يَوَدُّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَعَصَوُاْ ٱلرَّسُولَ لَوْ تُسَوَّىٰ بِهِمُ ٱلأَرْضُ وَلاَ يَكْتُمُونَ ٱللَّهَ حَدِيثاً }

O you who believe draw not near to prayer whilst you are inebriated until you know what you are saying nor whilst you are defiled unless you are traversing a way until you have washed yourselves. But if you are sick or on a journey or if any of you comes from the privy or you have touched women; and you can find no water wholesome soil and wipe your faces and your hands. God is ever Pardoning Forgiving. The prohibition against drinks which cause intoxication is not [a prohibi- tion] against prayer. Rather it is to say that you should not come to prayer when you are inebriated so you should avoid drinking that which will intoxicate you. Moreover when you come to prayer in that condition the prayer will not be accepted from you. Intoxication is the loss of mental functioning and awareness and with [this loss] intimate conversation with the Real is not appropriate. The one who is praying speaks intimately with his Lord so by way of allusion any- thing which causes the heart to be unmindful of God is included in this and thereby becomes part of this category. Intoxication is of several types: there is intoxication from wine and intoxication from heedlessness because of a preoccupying love for the present world. The most difficult intoxication is your intoxication with your lower self and it is that which throws you into a state of separation from Him. If someone is intoxicated from wine the end of his affair is burning ḥurqa if he is not forgiven. If someone is intoxicated with himself his state is separation furqa in the present moment from reality. As for the [praiseworthy form of] intoxication which the folk allude to its possessor has a time in which he is protected from it so that he may pray with ease. Then when he finishes the prayer [the intoxication] overwhelms him and seizes him [again]. [The intoxication of] those who are not protected in the precepts of the law is [an intoxication] mixed with worldly concern. Nor whilst you are defiled unless you are traversing a way: He gives per- mission to those who are compelled to take liberties when crossing through the place of prayer in the state of ritual impurity but if one deviates more than is necessary then one deserves reproof for there is no excuse.,{ أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ نَصِيباً مِّنَ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ يَشْتَرُونَ ٱلضَّلَٰلَةَ وَيُرِيدُونَ أَن تَضِلُّواْ ٱلسَّبِيلَ } * { وَٱللَّهُ أَعْلَمُ بِأَعْدَائِكُمْ وَكَفَىٰ بِٱللَّهِ وَلِيّاً وَكَفَىٰ بِٱللَّهِ نَصِيراً } * { مِّنَ ٱلَّذِينَ هَادُواْ يُحَرِّفُونَ ٱلْكَلِمَ عَن مَّوَاضِعِهِ وَيَقُولُونَ سَمِعْنَا وَعَصَيْنَا وَٱسْمَعْ غَيْرَ مُسْمَعٍ وَرَٰعِنَا لَيّاً بِأَلْسِنَتِهِمْ وَطَعْناً فِي ٱلدِّينِ وَلَوْ أَنَّهُمْ قَالُواْ سَمِعْنَا وَأَطَعْنَا وَٱسْمَعْ وَٱنْظُرْنَا لَكَانَ خَيْراً لَّهُمْ وَأَقْوَمَ وَلَكِن لَّعَنَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ بِكُفْرِهِمْ فَلاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً }
Have you not seen those who were given a share of the Book purchas- ing error and desiring that you should err from the wayḍ God has better knowledge of your enemies. God suffices as a Protector God suffices as a Helper. Some from among the Jews distort the words from their contexts and they say “We have heard and we disobey and hear as one who does not hear” and “Mind us” twisting with their tongues and slandering religion. If they had said “We have heard and obey” and “Hear” and “Consider us” it would have been better for them and more upright but God has cursed them for their unbelief so they believe not except a few. They practiced a deception but did not realize the way in which He deceived them in that they were given the book and then were deprived of the bless- ing of understanding so that they distorted [the words] and persisted [in their unbelief]. Some from among the Jews distort the words... They acted shamelessly toward the Messenger ﷺ and refused to show him respect so they were punished with doubt concerning his affair. Those who acted shamelessly devised a barrier between themselves and the blessing of [the Prophet's] companionship and the bounties of serving him. If they had hastened [instead] to reject the envy they felt and had accepted his state with venera- tion and honored [him] they would have found blessing in following him and happiness in both abodes. But how could they be otherwise when what had already been determined distanced themḍ They were kept back by fate qisma from the carpet of service khidma. There is no maneuvering that can help those held back by the [divine] decrees.,{ أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ نَصِيباً مِّنَ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ يَشْتَرُونَ ٱلضَّلَٰلَةَ وَيُرِيدُونَ أَن تَضِلُّواْ ٱلسَّبِيلَ } * { وَٱللَّهُ أَعْلَمُ بِأَعْدَائِكُمْ وَكَفَىٰ بِٱللَّهِ وَلِيّاً وَكَفَىٰ بِٱللَّهِ نَصِيراً } * { مِّنَ ٱلَّذِينَ هَادُواْ يُحَرِّفُونَ ٱلْكَلِمَ عَن مَّوَاضِعِهِ وَيَقُولُونَ سَمِعْنَا وَعَصَيْنَا وَٱسْمَعْ غَيْرَ مُسْمَعٍ وَرَٰعِنَا لَيّاً بِأَلْسِنَتِهِمْ وَطَعْناً فِي ٱلدِّينِ وَلَوْ أَنَّهُمْ قَالُواْ سَمِعْنَا وَأَطَعْنَا وَٱسْمَعْ وَٱنْظُرْنَا لَكَانَ خَيْراً لَّهُمْ وَأَقْوَمَ وَلَكِن لَّعَنَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ بِكُفْرِهِمْ فَلاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً }

O you who have been given the scripture believe in what We have revealed confirming what is with you before We obliterate faces and turn them inside out or curse them as We cursed those of the Sabbath and God's command is done. In We obliterate faces and turn them inside out the allusion is to the turn- ing away of hearts from spiritual desire irāda to the states of the people of habit ahl al-ʿāda so that despite the abundance of His calls to reject the present world they no longer pay any attention to them.,{ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لاَ يَغْفِرُ أَن يُشْرَكَ بِهِ وَيَغْفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذَلِكَ لِمَن يَشَآءُ وَمَن يُشْرِكْ بِٱللَّهِ فَقَدِ ٱفْتَرَىٰ إِثْماً عَظِيماً }
God forgives not that anything should be associated with Him. But He forgives other than that to whomever He wills. Whoever associates anything with God then he has indeed invented a tremendous sin. Ordinary people have been asked to abandon the outward association of anything [with God] shirk jalī while the elect have been asked to abandon hidden association shirk khafī. Those who seek access to Him with their actions thinking that it is from them or imagining that His decrees سبحانه are caused by what they do and do not do or pay heed to a created thing or look to themselves then their homeland is shirk according to the people of realities ahl al-ḥaqāÌiq. God forgives not that anything should be associated with Him. Also included among [those who associate partners with God] is anyone who imagines that his opposition has occurred in some way other than [God's] preordination taqdīr.,{ أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى ٱلَّذِينَ يُزَكُّونَ أَنْفُسَهُمْ بَلِ ٱللَّهُ يُزَكِّي مَن يَشَآءُ وَلاَ يُظْلَمُونَ فَتِيلاً } * { ٱنظُرْ كَيفَ يَفْتَرُونَ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ ٱلكَذِبَ وَكَفَىٰ بِهِ إِثْماً مُّبِيناً }
Have you not seen those who praise themselves for purityḍ Nay God purifies whom He will and they shall not be wronged a single date-thread. Consider how they invent falsehood against God and that suffices for a clear sin. Whoever relies on what people say about his purity or seeks the satisfaction of the elite over that of ordinary people is someone who praises himself for purity. Looking to the self is the greatest veil. Whoever imagines that he is purifying himself with litanies or efforts he undertakes by what he does or does not do is veiled by his own ignorance. Consider how they invent... alludes to those who let loose their tongues and claim what they have not actualized. The one who invents in this way does not say anything but that ears reject him and hearts are driven away. Then when he becomes silent he returns to a heart laid waste.,{ أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى ٱلَّذِينَ يُزَكُّونَ أَنْفُسَهُمْ بَلِ ٱللَّهُ يُزَكِّي مَن يَشَآءُ وَلاَ يُظْلَمُونَ فَتِيلاً } * { ٱنظُرْ كَيفَ يَفْتَرُونَ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ ٱلكَذِبَ وَكَفَىٰ بِهِ إِثْماً مُّبِيناً }

Whenever something appears to their hearts from this story their rejection leads them to abandon faith in it and to dismiss its people with contempt so they are punished over and over again.,{ وَٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ سَنُدْخِلُهُمْ جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلأَنْهَارُ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَآ أَبَداً لَّهُمْ فِيهَآ أَزْوَاجٌ مُّطَهَّرَةٌ وَنُدْخِلُهُمْ ظِـلاًّ ظَلِيلاً }
And those that believe and perform righteous deeds We shall admit them to gardens underneath which rivers flow wherein they abide: they shall have therein spouses purified and We shall admit them to plenteous shade. Today they are in the shade of [God's] care riʿāya and tomorrow in the shade of [His] protection ḥimāya and sufficiency kifāya. Indeed they are in the shade of solicitude ʿināya in this world and the next. People in this group are of different types: There are those who are in the shade of His mercy those who are in the shade of His care those who are in the shade of His special generosity those who are in the shade of His solicitude and those who are in the shade of His nearness.,{ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَأْمُرُكُمْ أَن تُؤدُّواْ ٱلأَمَانَاتِ إِلَىۤ أَهْلِهَا وَإِذَا حَكَمْتُمْ بَيْنَ ٱلنَّاسِ أَن تَحْكُمُواْ بِٱلْعَدْلِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ نِعِمَّا يَعِظُكُمْ بِهِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ سَمِيعاً بَصِيراً }
Verily God commands you to restore trusts. And when you judge between people that you judge with justice. Excellent is the admonition God gives you. God is ever Hearer Seer. To return trusts is to surrender intact the states of created beings to them after having watched over them so that you do not act in a corrupt manner with [people]. It is said of God سبحانه وتعالى that He has deposited trusts with you so to return the trust amāna to its rightful owner is to surrender it intact to God سبحانه secure from any breach of faith khiyāna on your part regarding it. To breach faith in the trust of the heart is to make claims with regard to it and to breach faith in the trust of your innermost self is to look to it [rather than to God]. To judge between people with justice is to treat [those] near and distant equally in giving and expending and [also] not to allow pervasive resent- ment to lead you to take revenge on any soul.,{ يَا أَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ أَطِيعُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَأَطِيعُواْ ٱلرَّسُولَ وَأُوْلِي ٱلأَمْرِ مِنْكُمْ فَإِن تَنَازَعْتُمْ فِي شَيْءٍ فَرُدُّوهُ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ وَٱلرَّسُولِ إِن كُنْتُمْ تُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلآخِرِ ذٰلِكَ خَيْرٌ وَأَحْسَنُ تَأْوِيلاً }
O you who believe obey God and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you. If you should quarrel about anything refer it to God and the Messenger if you believe in God and the Last Day; that is better and more excellent in interpretation. He compares obedience to Him with obedience to the Messenger ﷺ hon- oring his affair and elevating his status. Those in authority ulū l-amr: In scholarly terms this means the [worldly] ruler sulṬān. According to the explanation of deeper knowl- edge maʿrifa the one who has deeper knowledge ʿārif has authority dhū l-amr over the one who is just starting out. The shaykh has authority over the aspirant murīd. The leader imām of each group has authority over [the members of the group]. It is said that the friend and guardian walī of the aspirant is better awlā for the aspirant than the aspirant [himself]. If you should quarrel about anything refer it to God: In scholarly lan- guage this means the Book and the sunna. [But] according to the explana- tion of God's unity bayān al-tawḥīd it is to commit and entrust knowledge of [the matter] to God سبحانه. When two conflicting inclinations arise in the heart of a believer and [the believer] has [access to] the reasoning provided by religious scholars he can contemplate what he understands from their understanding. A master of the heart [on the other hand] entrusts [the matter] to the Real سبحانه and pays heed to what is said to him in his inner- most self and what has been cast into his heart without any intermediary.,{ أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى ٱلَّذِينَ يَزْعُمُونَ أَنَّهُمْ ءَامَنُواْ بِمَآ أُنْزِلَ إِلَيْكَ وَمَآ أُنزِلَ مِن قَبْلِكَ يُرِيدُونَ أَن يَتَحَاكَمُوۤاْ إِلَى ٱلطَّاغُوتِ وَقَدْ أُمِرُوۤاْ أَن يَكْفُرُواْ بِهِ وَيُرِيدُ ٱلشَّيْطَانُ أَن يُضِلَّهُمْ ضَلاَلاً بَعِيداً }
Have you not seen those who claim that they believe in what has been revealed to you and what was revealed before you desiring to take their disputes to a false deity when they have been commanded to renounce himḍ But Satan desires to mislead them far astray. Outwardly they proclaimed sincerity while acting hypocritically in secret. He سبحانه exposed them through the tongue of Gabriel عليه السلام saying “desir- ing to take their disputes to a false deity when they have been commanded to renounce him yakfurū bihi” that is reject him. Whoever abandons his path and returns to anyone other than his master ustādh becomes deserving of exclusion and condemnation.,{ وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمْ تَعَالَوْاْ إِلَىٰ مَآ أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ وَإِلَى ٱلرَّسُولِ رَأَيْتَ ٱلْمُنَٰفِقِينَ يَصُدُّونَ عَنكَ صُدُوداً }
And when it is said to them “Come to what God has revealed and the Messenger” you see the hypocrites turn away from you vehemently. Everything other than the word of the Real is easy for hypocrites [to hear]. [On the other hand] the declaration of God's unity is heard only by those who are sincere. Those who are listless and those who are hostile do not hear that which is true since it is difficult for those who are not sincere to oppose personal whims. Just as the eye of the bat is incapable of facing the sun the hypocrites were unable to stand firm before [the Prophet] ﷺ and that was the cause of their vehemently turning away.,{ فَكَيْفَ إِذَآ أَصَٰبَتْهُمْ مُّصِيبَةٌ بِمَا قَدَّمَتْ أَيْدِيهِمْ ثُمَّ جَآءُوكَ يَحْلِفُونَ بِٱللَّهِ إِنْ أَرَدْنَآ إِلاَّ إِحْسَٰناً وَتَوْفِيقاً }
How would it be when an affliction befalls them for what their own hands have sent before them! They then come to you swearing by God that “We sought only virtue and harmony.” The beseeching of the insincere at the attacks of misfortune is without foundation. It deserves no consideration because it only lasts until the tribulation has passed. The greater affliction is being indifferent to the affliction [brought on by what their own hands have sent before them]. It is said that part of the affliction is being deprived [of the blessing] in the present moment by that which is of no use to you.,{ أُولَـٰئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ يَعْلَمُ ٱللَّهُ مَا فِي قُلُوبِهِمْ فَأَعْرِضْ عَنْهُمْ وَعِظْهُمْ وَقُل لَّهُمْ فِيۤ أَنْفُسِهِمْ قَوْلاً بَلِيغاً }
Those-God knows what is in their hearts; so turn away from them and admonish them and say to them regarding their souls penetrating words. “Be generous with them in admonition as sympathy dictates but hold your heart back from being overly concerned for them or putting your trust in them. Know that you will not be able to help those whom We do not sup- port in any way.”,{ وَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن رَّسُولٍ إِلاَّ لِيُطَاعَ بِإِذْنِ ٱللَّهِ وَلَوْ أَنَّهُمْ إِذ ظَّلَمُوۤاْ أَنْفُسَهُمْ جَآءُوكَ فَٱسْتَغْفَرُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَٱسْتَغْفَرَ لَهُمُ ٱلرَّسُولُ لَوَجَدُواْ ٱللَّهَ تَوَّاباً رَّحِيماً }
We never sent any messenger but that he should be obeyed by the leave of God. If when they had wronged themselves they had come to you and asked forgiveness from God and the Messenger had asked forgiveness for them they would have found God Relenting Merciful. “We only commanded the messengers to call created beings to Us.” If when they had wronged themselves they had come to you: “If they had made you their means of access they would have reached Us.” It is said “If they had practiced being humble and poor iftiqār and had jumped on the horse of asking forgiveness istighfār they would have come to rest in the courtyard of kindnesses mabārr.”,{ فَلاَ وَرَبِّكَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ حَتَّىٰ يُحَكِّمُوكَ فِيمَا شَجَرَ بَيْنَهُمْ ثُمَّ لاَ يَجِدُواْ فِيۤ أَنْفُسِهِمْ حَرَجاً مِّمَّا قَضَيْتَ وَيُسَلِّمُواْ تَسْلِيماً }
But no by your Lord! They will not believe until they make you judge over what has broken out between them and find in themselves no inhibition regarding what you decide but submit in full submission. He has blocked the path to Himself for everyone unless there is faith in Muḥammad ﷺ. Those who do not walk under his banner have nothing to speak of before God. Moreover He has made one of the conditions of faith the complete removal of oppositional tendencies in your heart. And find in themselves no inhibition... There is no escape for you but to face even perilous situations laughing just as someone said: If a beloved is unfair to me I am fair to him. I gulp down for him the most bitter and give him what is sweet to drink. If he says to me “It is over” I choose equanimity without making difficulties.,{ وَلَوْ أَنَّا كَتَبْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ أَنِ ٱقْتُلُوۤاْ أَنْفُسَكُمْ أَوِ ٱخْرُجُواْ مِن دِيَارِكُمْ مَّا فَعَلُوهُ إِلاَّ قَلِيلٌ مِّنْهُمْ وَلَوْ أَنَّهُمْ فَعَلُواْ مَا يُوعَظُونَ بِهِ لَكَانَ خَيْراً لَّهُمْ وَأَشَدَّ تَثْبِيتاً } * { وَإِذاً لأَتَيْنَٰهُم مِّن لَّدُنَّـآ أَجْراً عَظِيماً } * { وَلَهَدَيْنَاهُمْ صِرَاطاً مُّسْتَقِيماً }
And had We prescribed for them: “slay yourselves” or “Leave your habitations” they would not have done it save a few of them; yet if they had done what they were admonished to do it would have been better for them and a firmer position. And then We would have surely given them from Us a great wage. And We would have guided them to a straight path. [God] exposed the weakness of their sincerity akhbara ʿan suqmi ikhlāṣihim and the extent of their bankruptcy wa-quwwati iflāsihim and informed [the Prophet and the believers] of their failings by His knowl- edge. Although [God] let [the hypocrites] go their own way in many of the tests He said “If they had been inclined to serve and had put on the belt of obedience it would have been better for them than their persisting in their disbelief and pride. If they had done that We would have given them a great reward thawāb ʿaẓīm from Us and would have guided them on a straight path ṣirāṬ mustaqīm and rendered to them an enduring gift ʿaṬāÌ muqīm. In the explanation by allusion bayān al-ishāra this matter refers to opposing personal whims and sacrificing the lower selves by holding them back from familiar and comfortable things. It is leaving [your] habitations and parting from the familiar territories of desire for the present world.,{ وَلَوْ أَنَّا كَتَبْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ أَنِ ٱقْتُلُوۤاْ أَنْفُسَكُمْ أَوِ ٱخْرُجُواْ مِن دِيَارِكُمْ مَّا فَعَلُوهُ إِلاَّ قَلِيلٌ مِّنْهُمْ وَلَوْ أَنَّهُمْ فَعَلُواْ مَا يُوعَظُونَ بِهِ لَكَانَ خَيْراً لَّهُمْ وَأَشَدَّ تَثْبِيتاً } * { وَإِذاً لأَتَيْنَٰهُم مِّن لَّدُنَّـآ أَجْراً عَظِيماً } * { وَلَهَدَيْنَاهُمْ صِرَاطاً مُّسْتَقِيماً }

Whoever obeys God and the Messenger they are with those whom God has blessed of the prophets and the truthful and the martyrs and the righteous. What fine companions they are! That is bounty from God. God suffices as Knower. He made obedience to the Chosen One al-MuṣṬafā ﷺ72 the key to attain- ing the stations of the prophets the truthful and the martyrs in a manner that is suitable for the community and appropriate for the high rank of [the Prophet] عليه السلام. That is bounty from God: He detached their situation from every cause merit and reason for surely what comes to them and what happens to them is the disbursement of His bounty and originates from His generosity.,{ وَمَن يُطِعِ ٱللَّهَ وَٱلرَّسُولَ فَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ مَعَ ٱلَّذِينَ أَنْعَمَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْهِم مِّنَ ٱلنَّبِيِّينَ وَٱلصِّدِّيقِينَ وَٱلشُّهَدَآءِ وَٱلصَّالِحِينَ وَحَسُنَ أُولَـٰئِكَ رَفِيقاً } * { ذٰلِكَ ٱلْفَضْلُ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ وَكَفَىٰ بِٱللَّهِ عَلِيماً }

O you who believe take your precautions then move forward in com- panies or move forward all together. Verily there are some of you who tarry; then if an affliction befalls you he says “God has been gracious to me for I was not a witness with them.” But if a bounty from God befalls you he will surely cry as if there had never been any affection between you and him: “Oh would that I had been with them so that I might have won a great triumph!” Fleeing toward firār ilā God is among the attributes of those who seek qāṣidūn. Fleeing with firār maʿa God is among the attributes of those who arrive wāṣilūn. Rest qarār with God cannot be found except by those who are sincere in fleeing to God. Fleeing from everything other [than God] is the concern of anyone who declares His unity. Verily there are some of you who tarry... that is their beliefs are not firmly established in one state. They are tied to worldly concerns so when they see something unpleasant approaching the Muslims they are grateful and say “Praise be to God who has protected us from following them and afflicting us with what He has afflicted them.” But if you have a blessing or something good they incline toward you and wish that they had been with you. They have lost in the present world and the hereafter. They are not completely73 disbelievers nor are they loyal believers. As if there had never been any affection between you and him: It means they had already dropped the commitment to protect and defend your lives property and honor.,{ يَٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءامَنُواْ خُذُواْ حِذْرَكُمْ فَٱنفِرُواْ ثُبَاتٍ أَوِ ٱنْفِرُواْ جَمِيعاً } * { وَإِنَّ مِنْكُمْ لَمَن لَّيُبَطِّئَنَّ فَإِنْ أَصَٰبَتْكُمْ مُّصِيبَةٌ قَالَ قَدْ أَنْعَمَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيَّ إِذْ لَمْ أَكُنْ مَّعَهُمْ شَهِيداً } * { وَلَئِنْ أَصَٰبَكُمْ فَضْلٌ مِنَ الله لَيَقُولَنَّ كَأَن لَّمْ تَكُنْ بَيْنَكُمْ وَبَيْنَهُ مَوَدَّةٌ يٰلَيتَنِي كُنتُ مَعَهُمْ فَأَفُوزَ فَوْزاً عَظِيماً }

So let them fight in the way of God those who sell the life of this world for the hereafter; and whoever fights in the way of God and is slain or conquers We shall give him a great wage. The struggle jihād of someone who has not slain the lower self in himself is not sound. The removal of the fear of death from the heart comes first and then the surrender of the lower self to it. We shall give him a great wage means “Our remaining after him is better for him than his life through his lower self.” Their speaker said: Are you not my compensation for myselfḍ That is honor enough. Besides you I have no goal nor anything to request.,{ وَمَا لَكُمْ لاَ تُقَٰتِلُونَ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ وَٱلْمُسْتَضْعَفِينَ مِنَ ٱلرِّجَالِ وَٱلنِّسَآءِ وَٱلْوِلْدَٰنِ ٱلَّذِينَ يَقُولُونَ رَبَّنَآ أَخْرِجْنَا مِنْ هَـٰذِهِ ٱلْقَرْيَةِ ٱلظَّالِمِ أَهْلُهَا وَٱجْعَلْ لَّنَا مِن لَّدُنْكَ وَلِيّاً وَٱجْعَلْ لَّنَا مِن لَّدُنْكَ نَصِيراً }
What is wrong with you that you do not fight in the way of God and for the oppressed men women and children who say “Our Lord bring us forth from this town whose people are evildoers and appoint for us a protector from You and appoint for us a helper from You.” “What is it that prevents you from fighting in the way of Godḍ What holds you back from desiring to give your lifeblood for Godḍ How would it be to your disadvantage to offer up your spirits in God and for Godḍ Are you afraid that you will give less than what is due to Godḍ Or do you not know that you will be gathered to Godḍ Why is it not enough that He remains after you have been annihilated in Godḍ,{ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ يُقَٰتِلُونَ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ وَٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ يُقَٰتِلُونَ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱلطَّٰغُوتِ فَقَٰتِلُوۤاْ أَوْلِيَاءَ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنِ إِنَّ كَيْدَ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنِ كَانَ ضَعِيفاً }
Those who believe fight in the way of God and those who disbelieve fight in the way of a false deity. Fight therefore against the friends of Satan; surely the plotting of Satan is ever feeble. Those who are sincerely devoted to God do not prefer anything to God and they do not hold anything back from God. They are ever against their lower selves for the sake of God. The states of those who disbelieve are the reverse of [those of] the believers. Therefore He strengthened and encouraged [the believers] saying Fight therefore against the friends of Satan that is “do not feel any fear toward them for I am taking care of your affairs and will suffice for you against your enemies.”,{ أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى ٱلَّذِينَ قِيلَ لَهُمْ كُفُّوۤاْ أَيْدِيَكُمْ وَأَقِيمُواْ ٱلصَّلَٰوةَ وَآتُواْ ٱلزَّكَٰوةَ فَلَمَّا كُتِبَ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلْقِتَالُ إِذَا فَرِيقٌ مِّنْهُمْ يَخْشَوْنَ ٱلنَّاسَ كَخَشْيَةِ ٱللَّهِ أَوْ أَشَدَّ خَشْيَةً وَقَالُواْ رَبَّنَا لِمَ كَتَبْتَ عَلَيْنَا ٱلْقِتَالَ لَوْلاۤ أَخَّرْتَنَا إِلَىٰ أَجَلٍ قَرِيبٍ قُلْ مَتَاعُ ٱلدُّنْيَا قَلِيلٌ وَٱلآخِرَةُ خَيْرٌ لِّمَنِ ٱتَّقَىٰ وَلاَ تُظْلَمُونَ فَتِيلاً }
Say “The enjoyment of this world is trifling; and the hereafter is bet- ter for him who fears; and you shall not be wronged a single date thread. He gave you power over this world but then said “The enjoyment of this world is trifling” so it is of no account for you. If you were to give alms from it so much as half a date you would be saved from the fire and reach the garden. This is the most extraordinary generosity. Caring little about what comes to you-because of your beloved-is the strongest indicator of your relationship. It is said that when He wants you to forsake the present world He makes it seem meager in your eyes so that abandoning it will be easy for you. It is said: Say “The enjoyment of this world-the sum total of it-is trifling. Since your portion is less than [this] trifling [amount] why would He quarrel with you over the details of what is permitted taḥlīl so long as your pact remains secure from alteration tabdīlḍ If the value of this world is trifling then the cheapest of the cheap are those who are content with the cheap khasīs in lieu of the precious nafīs. The believer is torn from the worlds of being kawn in degrees. First He said “say 'The enjoyment of this world is trifling; and the hereafter is better'”-He seizes them from the present world by what comes next. Then He robs them of both worlds saying But what is with God is better and more lasting [42:36].,{ أَيْنَمَا تَكُونُواْ يُدْرِككُّمُ ٱلْمَوْتُ وَلَوْ كُنتُمْ فِي بُرُوجٍ مُّشَيَّدَةٍ وَإِن تُصِبْهُمْ حَسَنَةٌ يَقُولُواْ هَـٰذِهِ مِنْ عِندِ ٱللَّهِ وَإِن تُصِبْهُمْ سَيِّئَةٌ يَقُولُواْ هَـٰذِهِ مِنْ عِندِكَ قُلْ كُلٌّ مِّنْ عِندِ ٱللَّهِ فَمَالِ هَـٰؤُلاۤءِ ٱلْقَوْمِ لاَ يَكَادُونَ يَفْقَهُونَ حَدِيثاً }
Wherever you may be death will overtake you though you should be in raised-up towers.” And if a good thing befalls them they say “This is from God”; but if an evil thing befalls them they say “This is from you.” Say “Everything is from God.” What is wrong with this people that they do not understandḍ Death is joy to the believer and the news of its drawing near is good news to him because it is a means of reaching the Real. Whoever loves to meet God God loves to meet him. It is said that since death is inevitable submitting to His decree willingly is better than tolerating it unwillingly. Moreover He told them that because of the weakness of their facul- ties of insight and the infirmity of their beliefs they are joyful and show gratitude when a good thing befalls them. But if an evil thing befalls them they are not guided to God. The Magian disposition flows in them so that they attribute aḌāfū [the evil thing] to something that is created. [God] replied to them saying “say to them O Muḥammad 'Everything is from God through [the acts of] creating and originating producing and invent- ing decreeing and facilitating.'”,{ مَّآ أَصَابَكَ مِنْ حَسَنَةٍ فَمِنَ ٱللَّهِ وَمَآ أَصَابَكَ مِن سَيِّئَةٍ فَمِن نَّفْسِكَ وَأَرْسَلْنَاكَ لِلنَّاسِ رَسُولاً وَكَفَىٰ بِٱللَّهِ شَهِيداً }
Whatever good befalls you it is from God; whatever evil befalls you is from yourself. We have sent you to people as a messenger and God suffices as Witness. Whatever good befalls you is a bounty from God and whatever evil befalls you is from yourself through acquisition kasb. Both of them are created by God سبحانه.,{ مَّنْ يُطِعِ ٱلرَّسُولَ فَقَدْ أَطَاعَ ٱللَّهَ وَمَن تَوَلَّىٰ فَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَاكَ عَلَيْهِمْ حَفِيظاً }
Whoever obeys the Messenger verily obeys God; and whoever turns his back We have not sent you as a watcher over them. This verse alludes to the gathering jamʿ of the state of the Messenger ﷺ for He سبحانه said “Obedience to him is obedience to Us. Whoever draws near to him draws near to Us. Whoever is accepted by him is accepted by Us maqbūluhu maqbūlunā and whoever is rejected by him is rejected by Us wa-mardūduhu mardūdunā.”,{ وَيَقُولُونَ طَاعَةٌ فَإِذَا بَرَزُواْ مِنْ عِندِكَ بَيَّتَ طَآئِفَةٌ مِّنْهُمْ غَيْرَ ٱلَّذِي تَقُولُ وَٱللَّهُ يَكْتُبُ مَا يُبَيِّتُونَ فَأَعْرِضْ عَنْهُمْ وَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ وَكَفَىٰ بِٱللَّهِ وَكِيلاً }
They say obedience; but when they sally forth from you a party of them harbor other than what they say. God writes down what they harbor [in themselves]. So turn away from them rely on God and God suffices as a Guardian. This means that “when they come to you [Muḥammad] they surrender to your witnessing mushāhada but when they leave the light of your approach iqbāl is cut off and they return to darknesses” just as they say: Whenever he repents he returns to his ignorance just as the one who is feeble suffers a relapse.,{ أَفَلاَ يَتَدَبَّرُونَ ٱلْقُرْآنَ وَلَوْ كَانَ مِنْ عِندِ غَيْرِ ٱللَّهِ لَوَجَدُواْ فِيهِ ٱخْتِلاَفاً كَثِيراً } * { وَإِذَا جَآءَهُمْ أَمْرٌ مِّنَ ٱلأَمْنِ أَوِ ٱلْخَوْفِ أَذَاعُواْ بِهِ وَلَوْ رَدُّوهُ إِلَى ٱلرَّسُولِ وَإِلَىٰ أُوْلِي ٱلأَمْرِ مِنْهُمْ لَعَلِمَهُ ٱلَّذِينَ يَسْتَنْبِطُونَهُ مِنْهُمْ وَلَوْلاَ فَضْلُ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ وَرَحْمَتُهُ لاَتَّبَعْتُمُ ٱلشَّيْطَانَ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً }
What do they not ponder yatadabbarūna the QurÌānḍ If it had been from other than God surely they would have found therein much inconsistency. And when there comes to them an issue be it of security or of fear they broadcast it. If they had referred it to the Messenger and to those in authority among them those among them who are able to think it out yastanbiṬūnahu would have known it from them. And but for the bounty of God to you and His mercy you would surely have followed Satan except a few [of you]. “Pondering” tadabbur is an allusion to meanings acquired through immersing [oneself] deeply in contemplation. The mining of the jewels of meanings is through precise “extraction” istinbāṬ. And when there comes to them an issue... Because they are heedless of the Real they have no one to whom they can transmit their secrets so they reveal the secret to each other. As for the believers the Knower of their secrets is their Friend and Protector. They speak with Him about what comes to them and have no need to broadcast the secret to any created being. The Hearer of their whispered confidence is God and the Knower of their hidden affairs is God. If they had referred it to the Messenger and to those in authority among them... that is if they had brought their secrets to those who are respected and those among the people of the story it would have dispelled their doubts and helped them through the light of guidance and spiritual instruction. And but for the bounty of God with His friends they would wander in every wadi of separation of the moment just as those outwardly like them do.,{ أَفَلاَ يَتَدَبَّرُونَ ٱلْقُرْآنَ وَلَوْ كَانَ مِنْ عِندِ غَيْرِ ٱللَّهِ لَوَجَدُواْ فِيهِ ٱخْتِلاَفاً كَثِيراً } * { وَإِذَا جَآءَهُمْ أَمْرٌ مِّنَ ٱلأَمْنِ أَوِ ٱلْخَوْفِ أَذَاعُواْ بِهِ وَلَوْ رَدُّوهُ إِلَى ٱلرَّسُولِ وَإِلَىٰ أُوْلِي ٱلأَمْرِ مِنْهُمْ لَعَلِمَهُ ٱلَّذِينَ يَسْتَنْبِطُونَهُ مِنْهُمْ وَلَوْلاَ فَضْلُ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ وَرَحْمَتُهُ لاَتَّبَعْتُمُ ٱلشَّيْطَانَ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً }

So fight in the way of God; you are charged only with yourself. And urge on the believers; maybe God will restrain the might of the disbelievers; God is mightier and more severe in castigation. “Rise up [Muḥammad] with Us in surrendering everything from you to Our command. Just as there is no one to compare to you in your rank because of your elevated status over all We likewise do not charge anyone but you with the like of what you have been charged and We do not burden anyone but you with what you have been burdened. This is because of your singular worth among those otherwise like you in outward form.”,{ مَّن يَشْفَعْ شَفَٰعَةً حَسَنَةً يَكُنْ لَّهُ نَصِيبٌ مِّنْهَا وَمَن يَشْفَعْ شَفَٰعَةً سَيِّئَةً يَكُنْ لَّهُ كِفْلٌ مِّنْهَا وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ مُّقِيتاً }
Whoever intercedes with a good intercession shall receive a share of it; and whoever intercedes with an evil intercession shall receive the like from it. God conserves all things. “The intercessor liberates the state of the one for whom he intercedes. The intercessor becomes worthy of a weighty rank from God سبحانه by virtue of his intercession while the one who hastens to do corruption with regard to Our command bears the responsibility and carries the weight of the sin.”,{ وَإِذَا حُيِّيتُم بِتَحِيَّةٍ فَحَيُّواْ بِأَحْسَنَ مِنْهَآ أَوْ رُدُّوهَآ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ حَسِيباً }
And when you are greeted with a greeting greet with better than it or return it. Surely God keeps count of all things. [This is] an instruction for them in amicable relations and the good man- ners of companionship. When someone presses some kindness on you it becomes a loan you owe him. Whether you do more than his act or not at least do not do less than what he has done.,{ ٱللَّهُ لاۤ إِلَـٰهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ لَيَجْمَعَنَّكُمْ إِلَىٰ يَوْمِ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ لاَ رَيْبَ فِيهِ وَمَنْ أَصْدَقُ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ حَدِيثاً }
God-there is no god except Him He will surely gather you on the Day of Resurrection whereof there is no doubt. And who is truer in state- ment than Godḍ This address contains both a negation and an affirmation. The negation concerns what is other than God-what is negated is impossible for them. The affirmation belongs to Him through [His] divinity. It is not possible to deny what He has affirmed for Himself.,{ فَمَا لَكُمْ فِي ٱلْمُنَافِقِينَ فِئَتَيْنِ وَٱللَّهُ أَرْكَسَهُمْ بِمَا كَسَبُوۤاْ أَتُرِيدُونَ أَن تَهْدُواْ مَنْ أَضَلَّ ٱللَّهُ وَمَن يُضْلِلِ ٱللَّهُ فَلَن تَجِدَ لَهُ سَبِيلاً }
What is wrong with you that you have become two parties regarding the hypocrites when God has overthrown them for what they earnedḍ What do you desire to guide him whom God has sent astrayḍ And he whom God sends astray you will never find for him a way. “Hold to the covenant regarding them for they are My enemies aʿdāÌī. Neither in this world or the next will they receive My good pleasure riḌāÌī. Your concern for them will not save them from what has been determined by My decree qismatī. The decrees do not revolve around [human] anxieties.”,{ وَدُّواْ لَوْ تَكْفُرُونَ كَمَا كَفَرُواْ فَتَكُونُونَ سَوَآءً فَلاَ تَتَّخِذُواْ مِنْهُمْ أَوْلِيَآءَ حَتَّىٰ يُهَاجِرُواْ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ فَإِنْ تَوَلَّوْاْ فَخُذُوهُمْ وَٱقْتُلُوهُمْ حَيْثُ وَجَدتُّمُوهُمْ وَلاَ تَتَّخِذُواْ مِنْهُمْ وَلِيّاً وَلاَ نَصِيراً } * { إِلاَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يَصِلُونَ إِلَىٰ قَوْمٍ بَيْنَكُمْ وَبَيْنَهُمْ مِّيثَٰقٌ أَوْ جَآءُوكُمْ حَصِرَتْ صُدُورُهُمْ أَن يُقَٰتِلُوكُمْ أَوْ يُقَٰتِلُواْ قَوْمَهُمْ وَلَوْ شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ لَسَلَّطَهُمْ عَلَيْكُمْ فَلَقَٰتَلُوكُمْ فَإِنِ ٱعْتَزَلُوكُمْ فَلَمْ يُقَٰتِلُوكُمْ وَأَلْقَوْاْ إِلَيْكُمُ ٱلسَّلَمَ فَمَا جَعَلَ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمْ عَلَيْهِمْ سَبِيلاً }
They long that you should disbelieve as they disbelieve so then you would be equal; therefore do not take friends from among them until they emigrate in the way of God; then if they turn away take them and slay them wherever you find them; and do not take any of them as a patron or as a helper. Except those who attach themselves to a people between whom and you there is a covenant or come to you with their breasts constricted about the prospect of fighting you or fighting their people. Had God willed He would have given them sway over you so that assuredly they would have fought you. And so if they stay away from you and do not fight you and offer you peace then God does not allow you any way against them. [This] alludes to those in confused and sickly states-they wish that the sincere would be like them. How absurd that their desire should come true! Until your antagonists stop trying to thwart you separate yourselves from them oppose them and do not change your state to suit them. Do not associate with them and do not take any of them as a patron or as a helper. Someone who is in harmony with your goal is better for you than forced association with someone who opposes you. Except those who attach themselves to a people... This verse is an allusion to [the fact] that He gives leave with these exceptions to associate outwardly in a kindly manner with those who are in a weak and oppressed condition. And so if they stay away from you... this alludes to [the case] when someone who is not one of the people of the story associates with you. If they are intent on remaining in their familiar areas of worldly concerns do not call them to your path but leave them be in peace. If [God] gives you the opportunity to look to them with mercy follow your good intentions with them. But if not leave them be in peace.,{ وَدُّواْ لَوْ تَكْفُرُونَ كَمَا كَفَرُواْ فَتَكُونُونَ سَوَآءً فَلاَ تَتَّخِذُواْ مِنْهُمْ أَوْلِيَآءَ حَتَّىٰ يُهَاجِرُواْ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ فَإِنْ تَوَلَّوْاْ فَخُذُوهُمْ وَٱقْتُلُوهُمْ حَيْثُ وَجَدتُّمُوهُمْ وَلاَ تَتَّخِذُواْ مِنْهُمْ وَلِيّاً وَلاَ نَصِيراً } * { إِلاَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يَصِلُونَ إِلَىٰ قَوْمٍ بَيْنَكُمْ وَبَيْنَهُمْ مِّيثَٰقٌ أَوْ جَآءُوكُمْ حَصِرَتْ صُدُورُهُمْ أَن يُقَٰتِلُوكُمْ أَوْ يُقَٰتِلُواْ قَوْمَهُمْ وَلَوْ شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ لَسَلَّطَهُمْ عَلَيْكُمْ فَلَقَٰتَلُوكُمْ فَإِنِ ٱعْتَزَلُوكُمْ فَلَمْ يُقَٰتِلُوكُمْ وَأَلْقَوْاْ إِلَيْكُمُ ٱلسَّلَمَ فَمَا جَعَلَ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمْ عَلَيْهِمْ سَبِيلاً }

You will find others desiring to have security from you and security from their own people; yet whenever they are returned to sedition they are overwhelmed by it. So if they do not stay away from you and offer you peace and restrain their hands then take them and slay them wherever you come upon them; against them We have given you clear warrant. The effort of anyone who desires to combine two opposing things is ruined and his resolve does not grow. Just as an individual cannot be both a hypo- crite and one who wholeheartedly submits muslim no individual can be desirous of the Real and remain with the precepts of the people of habit. Spiritual desire irāda and habit ʿāda are opposites. It is necessary to abandon contradictory stances and to distance yourself from that which has no relation to you.,{ وَمَا كَانَ لِمُؤْمِنٍ أَن يَقْتُلَ مُؤْمِناً إِلاَّ خَطَئاً وَمَن قَتَلَ مُؤْمِناً خَطَئاً فَتَحْرِيرُ رَقَبَةٍ مُّؤْمِنَةٍ وَدِيَةٌ مُّسَلَّمَةٌ إِلَىٰ أَهْلِهِ إِلاَّ أَن يَصَّدَّقُواْ فَإِن كَانَ مِن قَوْمٍ عَدُوٍّ لَّكُمْ وَهُوَ مُؤْمِنٌ فَتَحْرِيرُ رَقَبَةٍ مُّؤْمِنَةٍ وَإِن كَانَ مِن قَوْمٍ بَيْنَكُمْ وَبَيْنَهُمْ مِّيثَٰقٌ فَدِيَةٌ مُّسَلَّمَةٌ إِلَىۤ أَهْلِهِ وَتَحْرِيرُ رَقَبَةٍ مُّؤْمِنَةٍ فَمَن لَّمْ يَجِدْ فَصِيَامُ شَهْرَيْنِ مُتَتَابِعَيْنِ تَوْبَةً مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ عَلِيماً حَكِيماً }
It is not for a believer to slay a believer except by mistake. He who slays a believer by mistake then let him set free a believing slave and blood- money is to be submitted to his family unless they remit it as a charity. If he belongs to a people at war with you and is a believer then the setting free of a believing slave. If he belongs to a people between whom and you there is a covenant then the blood-money must be paid to his family and the setting free of a believing slave. But if he has not the wherewithal then the fasting of two successive months a relenting from God. And God is ever Knowing Wise. [God] mitigated the matter of someone who mistakenly [slays a believer] by giving the burden of restitution to the larger group responsible for the blood-money ʿāqila. The elite are responsible for the blood-money for the weak and oppressed mustaḌʿafūn in the community. The people of deeper knowledge ahl al-maʿrifa are responsible for the blood-money for the aspirants murīdūn. The shaykhs are responsible for the blood-money for the poor fuqarāÌ. Their way is to bear the burdens that afflict the weak and oppressed.,{ وَمَن يَقْتُلْ مُؤْمِناً مُّتَعَمِّداً فَجَزَآؤُهُ جَهَنَّمُ خَٰلِداً فِيهَا وَغَضِبَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَلَعَنَهُ وَأَعَدَّ لَهُ عَذَاباً عَظِيماً }
And whoever slays a believer deliberately his requital is hell abiding therein and God's wrath is with him and has cursed him and has prepared for him a mighty chastisement. Just as the slaying of another [human being] has been prohibited to you so is slaying yourself: whoever follows his whims sets out to shed his own blood. Whoever does not give good counsel and admonition to an aspirant and does not assist him in his resolve is endeavoring to shed [the aspirant's] blood. Such a person is held captive to his own state-it is fitting that the consequence to him should be an unpleasant one for he should not enjoy [the states] from which he has held aspirants back. [God] سبحانه said “O David when you see someone seeking me become a servant to him.”,{ يَٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ إِذَا ضَرَبْتُمْ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ فَتَبَيَّنُواْ وَلاَ تَقُولُواْ لِمَنْ أَلْقَىۤ إِلَيْكُمُ ٱلسَّلاَمَ لَسْتَ مُؤْمِناً تَبْتَغُونَ عَرَضَ ٱلْحَيَٰوةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا فَعِنْدَ ٱللَّهِ مَغَانِمُ كَثِيرَةٌ كَذٰلِكَ كُنْتُمْ مِّن قَبْلُ فَمَنَّ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْكُمْ فَتَبَيَّنُواْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيراً }
O you who believe when you are going forth in the way of God be discriminating and do not say to him who offers you peace: You are not a believer desiring the transient goods of the life of this world. With God are plenteous spoils. So you were formerly but God has been gracious to you. So be discriminating. Surely God is ever Aware of what you do. Associate with people according to what they show outwardly in their states. Do not falsely pretend to have insight into what is inside them for God is the one who is entrusted with secrets. This [pretension] is a corrupt inclina- tion that arises in you from the controlling elements of the lower self. But as for he whose vision [comes] through God nothing is veiled from him so let him protect the secret of God in what was disclosed to him and let him not reveal to his companion what God has shown him95 regarding it.,{ لاَّ يَسْتَوِي ٱلْقَٰعِدُونَ مِنَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ غَيْرُ أُوْلِي ٱلضَّرَرِ وَٱلْمُجَٰهِدُونَ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ بِأَمْوَٰلِهِمْ وَأَنْفُسِهِمْ فَضَّلَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْمُجَٰهِدِينَ بِأَمْوَٰلِهِمْ وَأَنْفُسِهِمْ عَلَى ٱلْقَٰعِدِينَ دَرَجَةً وَكُـلاًّ وَعَدَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْحُسْنَىٰ وَفَضَّلَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْمُجَٰهِدِينَ عَلَى ٱلْقَٰعِدِينَ أَجْراً عَظِيماً } * { دَرَجَاتٍ مِّنْهُ وَمَغْفِرَةً وَرَحْمَةً وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ غَفُوراً رَّحِيماً }
The believers who sit at home other than those who have an injury are not the equals of those who struggle in the way of God with their possessions and their lives. God has preferred those who struggle with their possessions and their lives over the ones who sit at home by a degree; yet to each God has promised the goodly reward and God has preferred those who struggle over the ones who sit at home with a great reward degrees from Him and forgiveness and mercy. Surely God is ever Forgiving Merciful. The Real سبحانه has gathered together all of His friends in His favors but He distinguishes between them in degrees. Whether one is rich or a servant there is one richer than him. With one who is great there is one greater than him. The stars glisten but the moon is above them and when the sun appears it outshines all by its light.,{ لاَّ يَسْتَوِي ٱلْقَٰعِدُونَ مِنَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ غَيْرُ أُوْلِي ٱلضَّرَرِ وَٱلْمُجَٰهِدُونَ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ بِأَمْوَٰلِهِمْ وَأَنْفُسِهِمْ فَضَّلَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْمُجَٰهِدِينَ بِأَمْوَٰلِهِمْ وَأَنْفُسِهِمْ عَلَى ٱلْقَٰعِدِينَ دَرَجَةً وَكُـلاًّ وَعَدَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْحُسْنَىٰ وَفَضَّلَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْمُجَٰهِدِينَ عَلَى ٱلْقَٰعِدِينَ أَجْراً عَظِيماً } * { دَرَجَاتٍ مِّنْهُ وَمَغْفِرَةً وَرَحْمَةً وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ غَفُوراً رَّحِيماً }
The believers who sit at home other than those who have an injury are not the equals of those who struggle in the way of God with their possessions and their lives. God has preferred those who struggle with their possessions and their lives over the ones who sit at home by a degree; yet to each God has promised the goodly reward and God has preferred those who struggle over the ones who sit at home with a great reward degrees from Him and forgiveness and mercy. Surely God is ever Forgiving Merciful. The Real سبحانه has gathered together all of His friends in His favors but He distinguishes between them in degrees. Whether one is rich or a servant there is one richer than him. With one who is great there is one greater than him. The stars glisten but the moon is above them and when the sun appears it outshines all by its light.,{ إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ تَوَفَّاهُمُ ٱلْمَلاۤئِكَةُ ظَالِمِيۤ أَنْفُسِهِمْ قَالُواْ فِيمَ كُنتُمْ قَالُواْ كُنَّا مُسْتَضْعَفِينَ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ قَالْوۤاْ أَلَمْ تَكُنْ أَرْضُ ٱللَّهِ وَاسِعَةً فَتُهَاجِرُواْ فِيهَا فَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ مَأْوَاهُمْ جَهَنَّمُ وَسَآءَتْ مَصِيراً }
And those whom the angels take [in death] while they are wronging their souls the angels will say “What was your predicamentḍ” They will say “We were oppressed in the land.” The angels will say “But was not God's earth spacious that you might have emigrated thereinḍ” As for such their abode shall be hell-an evil journey's end! This alludes to one whose time comes while he is still trapped in his lower self and enslaved to his desires-there is no excuse for him since he did not emigrate to the protection of His nearness so that he could be saved from the contemptible nature of his lower self. There is no veil between you and this talk except your whims.,{ إِلاَّ ٱلْمُسْتَضْعَفِينَ مِنَ ٱلرِّجَالِ وَٱلنِّسَآءِ وَٱلْوِلْدَانِ لاَ يَسْتَطِيعُونَ حِيلَةً وَلاَ يَهْتَدُونَ سَبِيلاً } * { فَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ عَسَى ٱللَّهُ أَن يَعْفُوَ عَنْهُمْ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ عَفُوّاً غَفُوراً }
Except the oppressed among the men women and children who are unable to devise a plan and are not guided to a way. As for such perhaps God will pardon them for God is ever Pardoning Forgiving. This alludes to those who are overwhelmed and annihilated by meanings maʿānī and then continue on as those who act on His behalf.97 They do not have power or strength [of their own] and what appears to them are [the decrees] He سبحانه causes to flow over them. After the return of their selves through the reality of the Real ḥaqq al-ḥaqq they are effaced from themselves and are not guided to anything other than Him as a way and do not take so much as a breath for anything other than Him. In accordance with the outward aspect of the verse it is said that per- haps the Real سبحانه will grant His pardon to those whose excuses held them back from choosing [to emigrate].,{ إِلاَّ ٱلْمُسْتَضْعَفِينَ مِنَ ٱلرِّجَالِ وَٱلنِّسَآءِ وَٱلْوِلْدَانِ لاَ يَسْتَطِيعُونَ حِيلَةً وَلاَ يَهْتَدُونَ سَبِيلاً } * { فَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ عَسَى ٱللَّهُ أَن يَعْفُوَ عَنْهُمْ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ عَفُوّاً غَفُوراً }

Whoever emigrates in the way of God will find in the earth many refuges and abundance; whoever goes forth from his house as an emigrant to God and His Messenger and then death overtakes him his wage is then incumbent upon God; surely God is ever Forgiving Merciful. Whoever emigrates in [the way of] God from what is other than God and sets aright his direction to God finds ample space in the courtyard of generosity a resting place in the shelter of welcome and a spacious life under the wing of nearness. The emigrant in the truest sense is who- ever emigrates from his lower self and personal whim. This can only be accomplished through the abandonment of everything he desires. Whoever directs himself to [God] but does not reach Him before his time comes-he cannot but end up on the plains of communion with Him. There will be no resting place for his spirit other than the homelands of nearness to Him.,{ وَإِذَا ضَرَبْتُمْ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ فَلَيْسَ عَلَيْكُمْ جُنَاحٌ أَن تَقْصُرُواْ مِنَ ٱلصَّلَٰوةِ إِنْ خِفْتُمْ أَن يَفْتِنَكُمُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوۤاْ إِنَّ ٱلْكَافِرِينَ كَانُواْ لَكُمْ عَدُوّاً مُّبِيناً }
And when you are going forth in the land you would not be at fault if you shorten the prayer if you fear that you may be afflicted by those who do not believe; the disbelievers are a manifest foe to you. The shortening of prayers is the recommended practice sunna in travel. Although first legislated in a time of fear it remained even without the fear [as] a kindness to [God's] servants. When the obligatory prayers were permitted to be shortened because of travel they were given leave to sub- stitute supererogatory devotion on their camel mounts. [This could be done] without seeking the qibla in whichever way [the mount] turned and likewise with a person on foot. This was so that it would be known that permission to engage in talk with God is ongoing at any time. If you wish to take part in it you may do so whenever you wish. If you wish the allowance to refrain you may do as you wish. This is the most extraordi- nary kindness. It is a protection of the practice sunna of the fulfillment [of God's commands] wafāÌ and the consummation of the true meaning of friendship walāÌ.,{ وَإِذَا كُنتَ فِيهِمْ فَأَقَمْتَ لَهُمُ ٱلصَّلَٰوةَ فَلْتَقُمْ طَآئِفَةٌ مِّنْهُمْ مَّعَكَ وَلْيَأْخُذُوۤاْ أَسْلِحَتَهُمْ فَإِذَا سَجَدُواْ فَلْيَكُونُواْ مِن وَرَآئِكُمْ وَلْتَأْتِ طَآئِفَةٌ أُخْرَىٰ لَمْ يُصَلُّواْ فَلْيُصَلُّواْ مَعَكَ وَلْيَأْخُذُواْ حِذْرَهُمْ وَأَسْلِحَتَهُمْ وَدَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لَوْ تَغْفُلُونَ عَنْ أَسْلِحَتِكُمْ وَأَمْتِعَتِكُمْ فَيَمِيلُونَ عَلَيْكُمْ مَّيْلَةً وَاحِدَةً وَلاَ جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ إِن كَانَ بِكُمْ أَذًى مِّن مَّطَرٍ أَوْ كُنتُمْ مَّرْضَىۤ أَن تَضَعُوۤاْ أَسْلِحَتَكُمْ وَخُذُواْ حِذْرَكُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ أَعَدَّ لِلْكَافِرِينَ عَذَاباً مُّهِيناً }
When you are among them and you stand to lead them in prayer let a party of them stand with you and let them take their weapons. Then when they have performed their prostrations let them be behind you and let another party who have not prayed come and pray with you taking their precautions and their weapons. The disbelievers wish that you should be heedless of your weapons and your baggage that they may descend upon you all at once. You are not at fault if rain bothers you or if you are sick to lay aside your weapons. But take your precautions; God has prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating chastisement. This verse indicates that [the obligation of] prayer is not lifted from the servant so long as there is a breath remaining in him to choose. Not in fear or in security not when you are in a state of separation where the precepts of the law predominate or when overwhelmed by the authority of reality sulṬān al-ḥaqīqa when you are at the source of gathering together ʿayn al-jamʿ.,{ فَإِذَا قَضَيْتُمُ ٱلصَّلَٰوةَ فَٱذْكُرُواْ ٱللَّهَ قِيَاماً وَقُعُوداً وَعَلَىٰ جُنُوبِكُمْ فَإِذَا ٱطْمَأْنَنتُمْ فَأَقِيمُواْ ٱلصَّلَٰوةَ إِنَّ ٱلصَّلَٰوةَ كَانَتْ عَلَى ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ كِتَٰباً مَّوْقُوتاً }
When you have performed the prayer remember God standing and sitting and on your sides. Then when you are reassured observe the prayer surely the prayer is for believers a prescription at specific times. The external duties are at specific times while the presence of the heart in remembrance is continuous without stopping. In terms of the outward markers [of religion] it is one time and not another. But in terms of hearts beware of being absent from reality for even a moment no matter what state you are in. Remembrance is for however you are just as you are. Prayer is for when you are reassured.,{ وَلاَ تَهِنُواْ فِي ٱبْتِغَآءِ ٱلْقَوْمِ إِن تَكُونُواْ تَأْلَمُونَ فَإِنَّهُمْ يَأْلَمُونَ كَمَا تَأْلَمونَ وَتَرْجُونَ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ مَا لاَ يَرْجُونَ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ عَلِيماً حَكِيماً }
Be not faint in seeking the enemy; if you are suffering they are also suffering as you are suffering; and you hope from God that for which they cannot hope. God is ever Knower Wise. Stand up for God and let your trust be in God in your struggle jihād. If you are suffering they are also suffering: The enemy shares with you the experience of suffering but they are different from you in the witness- ing of the heart for you witness what they do not witness and you find in your hearts what they do not find. So it is unseemly for you to lag behind them in effort and struggle.,{ إِنَّآ أَنْزَلْنَا إِلَيْكَ ٱلْكِتَابَ بِٱلْحَقِّ لِتَحْكُمَ بَيْنَ ٱلنَّاسِ بِمَآ أَرَاكَ ٱللَّهُ وَلاَ تَكُنْ لِّلْخَآئِنِينَ خَصِيماً } * { وَٱسْتَغْفِرِ ٱللَّهَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ غَفُوراً رَّحِيماً }
Surely We have revealed to you the Book with the truth so that you may judge between people by that which God has shown you. And do not be a disputant for traitors. And pray for forgiveness from God; surely God is ever Forgiving Merciful. “We did not command you to judge between them blindly but rather by that which God has shown you that is by that which He unveiled to you from the lights of insight until you understood it by Our teaching you and Our directing you. This is also the case with those from your community who judge with the truth.” And do not be a disputant for traitors: that is do not defend the masters of worldly concerns arbāb al-ḥuẓūẓ but rather be with the children of [God's] rights abnāÌ al-ḥuqūq. Whoever turns to their whim is a trai- tor to the fear of God taqwā entrusted to his soul. Whoever trusts the inclinations of lower desires is a traitor to the shame ḥayāÌ100 required of him before the eyes of the Protector. “And pray for forgiveness from God for your community for surely We suffice for you in Our saying 'that God may forgive you what is past of your sin'” [48:2].,{ إِنَّآ أَنْزَلْنَا إِلَيْكَ ٱلْكِتَابَ بِٱلْحَقِّ لِتَحْكُمَ بَيْنَ ٱلنَّاسِ بِمَآ أَرَاكَ ٱللَّهُ وَلاَ تَكُنْ لِّلْخَآئِنِينَ خَصِيماً } * { وَٱسْتَغْفِرِ ٱللَّهَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ غَفُوراً رَّحِيماً }

And do not dispute on behalf of those who betray themselves; surely God loves not one who is treacherous and sinful. They hide themselves from people but they do not hide themselves from God; for He is with them while they plot at night with discourse displeas- ing to Him. God is ever Encompassing of what they do. Those who prefer their worldly concerns ḥuẓūẓ over His rights ḥuqūq and are content to remain in the familiar territories of their whim without moving to the waystations of the [ultimate] contentment riḌāÌ -God does not love those who are treacherous. He will humble them and most assuredly will not honor them. They hide themselves from people: Their hearts are dominated by what created beings can see [or not see]. Those who have been branded with the mark of separation have no awareness that the Real views their hearts from on high.,{ وَلاَ تُجَادِلْ عَنِ ٱلَّذِينَ يَخْتَانُونَ أَنْفُسَهُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لاَ يُحِبُّ مَن كَانَ خَوَّاناً أَثِيماً } * { يَسْتَخْفُونَ مِنَ ٱلنَّاسِ وَلاَ يَسْتَخْفُونَ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ وَهُوَ مَعَهُمْ إِذْ يُبَيِّتُونَ مَا لاَ يَرْضَىٰ مِنَ ٱلْقَوْلِ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ بِمَا يَعْمَلُونَ مُحِيطاً }

Ah! There you are-you have contested on their behalf in the life of this world; but who will contest against God on their behalf on the Day of Resurrection or who will be a guardian for them. That is “We defend them out of respect for you Muḥammad because you are among them but what will their state be on the Day of Resurrection when your blessing O believers will be withdrawn from themḍ”,{ وَمَن يَعْمَلْ سُوۤءاً أَوْ يَظْلِمْ نَفْسَهُ ثُمَّ يَسْتَغْفِرِ ٱللَّهَ يَجِدِ ٱللَّهَ غَفُوراً رَّحِيماً }
Whoever does evil or wrongs himself and then prays for God's forgive- ness he shall find God Forgiving Merciful. “Then” is a particle indicating extended time. That is to say they pass their lives engaged in useless activities and oppositional behaviors and then at the end of their lives pray for God's forgiveness. He shall find God: Finding wujūd is the ultimate event. The disobedient seek only forgiveness but God سبحانه brings one to the utmost by His grace if He wills. His way sunna is to bring about more than what one hopes for.,{ وَمَن يَكْسِبْ إِثْماً فَإِنَّمَا يَكْسِبُهُ عَلَىٰ نَفْسِهِ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ عَلِيماً حَكِيماً }
And whoever commits a sin commits it against himself only; and God is ever Knower Wise. The Real has no need for the obedience of those who are obedient or the error of the disobedient. So the one who obeys acquires his good for- tune fa-ḥaẓẓuhu ḥaṣṣala and the one who disobeys has abandoned it fa-ḥaẓẓuhu akhalla.,{ وَمَن يَكْسِبْ خَطِيۤئَةً أَوْ إِثْماً ثُمَّ يَرْمِ بِهِ بَرِيئاً فَقَدِ ٱحْتَمَلَ بُهْتَاناً وَإِثْماً مُّبِيناً }
And whoever commits a mistake or a sin and then casts it upon the innocent he has thereby burdened himself with calumny and a manifest sin. Whoever attributes his own disgraceful acts to an innocent person-God turns the tables on him by clothing the innocent one with the robe of the good deeds of his accuser and by pulling the garment of pardon over his bad deeds. And He reverses the situation for the aggressor by exposing his behaviors to his peers.,{ وَلَوْلاَ فَضْلُ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْكَ وَرَحْمَتُهُ لَهَمَّتْ طَّآئِفَةٌ مِّنْهُمْ أَن يُضِلُّوكَ وَمَا يُضِلُّونَ إِلاَّ أَنْفُسَهُمْ وَمَا يَضُرُّونَكَ مِن شَيْءٍ وَأَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْكَ ٱلْكِتَابَ وَٱلْحِكْمَةَ وَعَلَّمَكَ مَا لَمْ تَكُنْ تَعْلَمُ وَكَانَ فَضْلُ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْكَ عَظِيماً }
Were it not for God's bounty to you and His mercy a party of them would have intended to lead you astray; but they lead only themselves astray; they will not hurt you at all. God has revealed to you the Book and wisdom and He has taught you what you did not know; and God's bounty to you is ever great. Bounty faḌl is beneficence iḥsān beyond what is due. “Bounty” alludes to [God's] protection ʿiṣma of [Muḥammad] for the Real سبحانه protected him with a distinctive protection singled out for him. Just as [God] pro- tected [Muḥammad] from abandoning His right ḥaqq He protected him in averting the deception of His creatures khalq from him saying “Were it not for God's bounty to you and His mercy a party of them would have intended to lead you astray. There is no way that anyone can lead you astray for you are in the grip of the divine power and they lead only themselves astray and they will not hurt you at all for what is guarded maḥfūẓ by Us is secure maḥrūs from everything else. Verily God سبحانه conferred distinction upon you with the revelation of the Book and made you a special intimate in the ways He preferred and approved of you.” And He has taught you what you did not know. There is nothing like the knowledge He granted to [Muḥammad] alone. It is possible that what He means by this is [Muḥammad's] ﷺ knowledge of God and His majesty and his knowledge of his own servanthood and the worth of his state in strength and beauty. It is said that “He has taught you what you did not know of the propri- eties of service ādāb al-khidma even as a deep knowledge of reality was unambiguous to you.” It is said that “He made you free of the instruction of any others so that none would have a light except what is borrowed from your light. Those who do not walk under your banner will not reach the entirety of Our beneficence nor will they receive the good fortune of nearness and communion with Us.” “And God's bounty to you is ever great in all eternity without end ābād.” You were recognized by Us in the most exalted degree and honorable rank in all eternity without beginning āzāl. It is said that “He has taught you what you did not know concerning the sublimity of your rank over all others.” It is said that “He taught you what you did not know: that one can only value Our measure to the degree108 that one conforms to Our command.”,{ لاَّ خَيْرَ فِي كَثِيرٍ مِّن نَّجْوَاهُمْ إِلاَّ مَنْ أَمَرَ بِصَدَقَةٍ أَوْ مَعْرُوفٍ أَوْ إِصْلاَحٍ بَيْنَ ٱلنَّاسِ وَمَن يَفْعَلْ ذٰلِكَ ٱبْتِغَآءَ مَرْضَاتِ ٱللَّهِ فَسَوْفَ نُؤْتِيهِ أَجْراً عَظِيماً }
There is no good in much of their secret conversations except for he who enjoins to voluntary almsgiving or kindness or setting things right between people. And whoever does that desiring God's good pleasure We shall surely give him a great wage. The best of deeds is the one whose blessing extends beyond the doer to others-the excellence of almsgiving ṣadaqa is because its benefit extends to the one who receives your gift. Chivalry futuwwa is to exert yourself for others. In the tradition [the Prophet said] “The worst of mankind are those who eat by themselves.” The term “almsgiving” ṣadaqa can be applied to every kind of good action iḥsān. Regarding the shortening of prayers in travel [the Prophet] ﷺ said “This is an almsgiving which God has given you so accept His almsgiving.” Almsgiving is of several types: your almsgiving to your self nafs and your almsgiving to others. Your almsgiving to your self is to prompt it to perform the rights of God most high to restrain it from opposing His com- mand to hold back its hand from harming created things and to defend its thoughts and beliefs from evil. Your almsgiving to others is the almsgiv- ing through wealth the heart and the body. The almsgiving of wealth is the expenditure of riches niʿma the almsgiving of the body is through performing service khidma and the almsgiving of the heart is through good intention and strong aspiration himma. Almsgiving to the poor is an external act about which there are no doubts. Almsgiving to the rich would be that you are generous in your concern for them not expecting anything from them and not harboring covetous feelings regarding them. As for kindness maʿrūf every good thing in the law is a kindness in which there is help for Muslims the granting of felicity for them in near- ness to God and intimacy with Him and their elevation in encouraging one another to willing obedience. Whoever gives the alms of obeying his Lord with his lower self and gives alms of contentment with His decree with his heart seeks no revenge for himself and encourages people to that which will save them and guide [them] to their Lord. By the sincerity of such a person's state he sets things right between people.,{ وَمَن يُشَاقِقِ ٱلرَّسُولَ مِن بَعْدِ مَا تَبَيَّنَ لَهُ ٱلْهُدَىٰ وَيَتَّبِعْ غَيْرَ سَبِيلِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ نُوَلِّهِ مَا تَوَلَّىٰ وَنُصْلِهِ جَهَنَّمَ وَسَآءَتْ مَصِيراً }
But whoever makes a breach with the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him and follows other than the way of the believers We shall turn him over to what he has turned to and We shall expose him in hell-an evil journey's end. Thoughts khawāṬir that come from the Real are His emissaries to the servant. Whoever opposes the subtle directives ishārāt that are demanded by the inner path brings upon himself the punishments of hearts. Included among these is the blinding of his eyes to the perception of what is right rushd. Just as someone who resists consensus ijmāʿ in the [outer] religion leaves the fold so someone who resists what he recognizes as the truth after the path has become clear to him falls away.,{ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لاَ يَغْفِرُ أَن يُشْرَكَ بِهِ وَيَغْفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذٰلِكَ لِمَن يَشَآءُ وَمَن يُشْرِكْ بِٱللَّهِ فَقَدْ ضَلَّ ضَلاَلاً بَعِيداً } * { إِن يَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِهِ إِلاَّ إِنَٰثاً وَإِن يَدْعُونَ إِلاَّ شَيْطَٰناً مَّرِيداً } * { لَّعَنَهُ ٱللَّهُ وَقَالَ لأَتَّخِذَنَّ مِنْ عِبَادِكَ نَصِيباً مَّفْرُوضاً } * { وَلأُضِلَّنَّهُمْ وَلأُمَنِّيَنَّهُمْ وَلأَمُرَنَّهُمْ فَلَيُبَتِّكُنَّ ءَاذَانَ ٱلأَنْعَٰمِ وَلأَمُرَنَّهُمْ فَلَيُغَيِّرُنَّ خَلْقَ ٱللَّهِ وَمَن يَتَّخِذِ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنَ وَلِيّاً مِّن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ فَقَدْ خَسِرَ خُسْرَاناً مُّبِيناً }
God does not forgive that anything should be associated with Him; He forgives all except that to whomever He will. Whoever associates anything with God verily he has strayed far away. What they pray to instead of Him are but females and they only pray to a rebellious satan. God has cursed him. And he said “Assuredly I will take to myself an appointed portion of Your servants. And I will surely lead them astray and surely I will fill them with desires; and surely I will command them and they will cut up the cattle's ears. And surely I will command them and they will change God's creation.” And whoever takes Satan for a patron instead of God has surely suffered a manifest loss. God does not forgive that anything should be associated with Him: The acknowledgment of anything other than Him imagining even an atom to be a cause of origination is the very essence of associating others with God shirk. There is no possibility of pardon for it while there is a pos- sibility for pardon for other things. Those who seek access to [God] سبحانه by means of what they imagine are associating others with Him without realizing it. No He is God the One. What they pray to instead of Him are but females: They set up inanimate things with names and plunged forward in their delusion. They relied on the errors of conjecture and therefore strayed far from the truth. And they only pray to a rebellious satan. God has cursed him: that is what they pray to is none other than Iblīs whom the Real has distanced from His mercy and sent away by His distancing. But Iblīs himself is one who is turned about in the grip [of God] according to what the Creator desires. If there was even an atom of [self-sufficiency] that one could affirm in him [that would mean that] there is an associate to divinity in him. Instead it is only the Real سبحانه who brings about in created beings their states and circumstances aḥwālan and who creates that which follows [satanic] whisperings in being led astray Ḍalālan. For He سبحانه is the Guide and the One who leads astray and the One who has free disposal over all. [God] most high creates the power of expectations āmālan in [human] hearts after [satanic] whisperings and He makes their ugly actions aʿmālan seem beautiful in their eyes.,{ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لاَ يَغْفِرُ أَن يُشْرَكَ بِهِ وَيَغْفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذٰلِكَ لِمَن يَشَآءُ وَمَن يُشْرِكْ بِٱللَّهِ فَقَدْ ضَلَّ ضَلاَلاً بَعِيداً } * { إِن يَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِهِ إِلاَّ إِنَٰثاً وَإِن يَدْعُونَ إِلاَّ شَيْطَٰناً مَّرِيداً } * { لَّعَنَهُ ٱللَّهُ وَقَالَ لأَتَّخِذَنَّ مِنْ عِبَادِكَ نَصِيباً مَّفْرُوضاً } * { وَلأُضِلَّنَّهُمْ وَلأُمَنِّيَنَّهُمْ وَلأَمُرَنَّهُمْ فَلَيُبَتِّكُنَّ ءَاذَانَ ٱلأَنْعَٰمِ وَلأَمُرَنَّهُمْ فَلَيُغَيِّرُنَّ خَلْقَ ٱللَّهِ وَمَن يَتَّخِذِ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنَ وَلِيّاً مِّن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ فَقَدْ خَسِرَ خُسْرَاناً مُّبِيناً }

And who is fairer in religion than he who submits his purpose to God and is virtuous and who follows the creed of Abraham as a ḥanīfḍ And God took Abraham as a close friend. To God belongs all that is in the heavens and in the earth; and God is ever the Encompasser of all things. There is no one fairer in religion than he who submits his purpose to God. It means one who has made seeking God his sole objective and has purified his compact with God from what is other than God. For that reason he submits himself in all of his states to God through God and does not hold back anything from God from his wealth his body his spirit his strength his family and his children. This was the state of Abraham عليه السلام. And is virtuous muḥsin: Being virtuous iḥsān as attested to in the sacred law is to worship God as if you see Him. It is necessary that a rem- nant from the reality of separation ʿayn al-farq remain for the servant so that the performance of [God's] rights سبحانه will be sound for if he were to be completely taken over by the [ultimate] reality his submission and virtue would not be sound. This is following Abraham عليه السلام the ḥanīf. Nothing remained of him which could be described as permanent. And God took Abraham as a close friend khalīl: He separated the event from any effort labor seeking and striving when He said this so that it would be known that friendship khulla is an act of being clothed by the Real not an attribute which the servant acquires. It is said that the friend al-khalīl is entirely in need of the Real at every breath. In every one of his breaths and states there is nothing for him that is not through God and for God. [The word khalīl] is derived from khalla which means poverty khaṣāṣa and need ḥāja. It is [also] said to come from [the word] khulla which means love maḥabba. Friendship khulla is love maḥabba that reaches every part of someone. It permeates takhallala one's innermost self until there is no entry to it for anyone else. When God سبحانه had purified and emptied [Abraham] عليه السلام of [any other] He raised him up in upholding His right after [Abraham's] erasure from everything that is not God سبحانه. Then He said “And announce among the people the [season for] pilgrimage” [22:27]: The pilgrim does not say labayyka except to God and this is an allusion to the gathering of the gathering jamʿ al-jamʿ.,{ وَمَنْ أَحْسَنُ دِيناً مِمَّنْ أَسْلَمَ وَجْهَهُ لله وَهُوَ مُحْسِنٌ واتَّبَعَ مِلَّةَ إِبْرَٰهِيمَ حَنِيفاً وَٱتَّخَذَ ٱللَّهُ إِبْرَاهِيمَ خَلِيلاً } * { وَللَّهِ مَا فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ مُّحِيطاً }

They will ask you for a pronouncement concerning women. Say: “God pronounces to you concerning them and what is recited to you in the Book concerning the orphan women to whom you do not give what is prescribed for them for you desire to marry them and the oppressed children and that you deal justly with orphans. Whatever good you do God is ever Knower of it.” He prohibited [men] from coveting that which would lead them to do harm or wrong to oppressed women and orphans. He explained that God is their avenger and that whoever is heedful of God regarding them will not lose anything on account of God but rather will find a beautiful recompense jamīl al-jazāÌ. But whoever abuses them will suffer because of that a pain- ful tribulation alīm al-balāÌ.,{ وَإِنِ ٱمْرَأَةٌ خَافَتْ مِن بَعْلِهَا نُشُوزاً أَوْ إِعْرَاضاً فَلاَ جُنَاْحَ عَلَيْهِمَآ أَن يُصْلِحَا بَيْنَهُمَا صُلْحاً وَٱلصُّلْحُ خَيْرٌ وَأُحْضِرَتِ ٱلأنْفُسُ ٱلشُّحَّ وَإِن تُحْسِنُواْ وَتَتَّقُواْ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيراً }
And if a woman fears from her husband ill-treatment or rejection iʿrāḌ they are not at fault if they are reconciled through some agreement; reconciliation is better. But greed has been made present in the souls. If you are virtuous and fear surely God is ever aware of what you do. When the companionship of created beings becomes disconnected from the discourse of the Real [there is] a risk of alienation and blame al-waḥsha wa-l-malāma and [it] becoming mixed with aversion and disgust al- nafra wa-l-saÌāma. Whoever rejects ʿarada God in his heart-created beings [will] reject consideration for his right. They all come out against him find his affair pathetic bi-istiṣghāri amrihi and regard his worth as contemptible wa-ishtiḥqāri qadrihi. But whoever returns to God in his heart his affair will be restored to balance as a whole and in its particulars. His chest will expand with the capacity to bear the bad traits he finds in others and he will draw the cloak of pardon over the defects of all of them and prefer reconciliation ṣulḥ by abandoning his own portion in favor of theirs. God most high said “Reconciliation is better.” To ignore your aversion to those who quarrel with you is more appro- priate and more advantageous for you than being arrogant with your foe and wanting revenge and the acknowledgment of your privileges. Most people are in the fetters of this tribulation. But greed has been made present in the souls: The greed of the lower self is the concern of the servant for his worldly portion. Whoever is veiled from witnessing the Real is inevitably brought back to witnessing the lower self. If you are virtuous: [This] means that would be better for you. Being virtuous iḥsān is that you worship God as if you see him. And fear: [This] means [fear] to look at your own status and worth. Rather look to your Lord and in seeing Him be annihilated from any vision of your own worth. Surely God is ever aware of what you do: [This] means that once you have been annihilated from yourselves and your acts God suffices as Knower [4:70] after your annihilation and He suffices as the Giver of existence fol- lowing your effacement.,{ وَلَن تَسْتَطِيعُوۤاْ أَن تَعْدِلُواْ بَيْنَ ٱلنِّسَآءِ وَلَوْ حَرَصْتُمْ فَلاَ تَمِيلُواْ كُلَّ ٱلْمَيْلِ فَتَذَرُوهَا كَٱلْمُعَلَّقَةِ وَإِن تُصْلِحُواْ وَتَتَّقُواْ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ غَفُوراً رَّحِيماً }
You will never be able to be just to your wives even if you are eager; yet do not turn altogether away so that you leave her like one suspended. If you set things right and fear surely God is ever Forgiving Merciful. [This] means when your concern is for yourself in your affairs the state of your union together is overturned and what was sound becomes ruined. But when you have made God your concern in your affairs the balance of your life together will be restored and at that time will be cleared of turmoil. It is said that if God has decreed deficiency in intellect as someone's state it will not be possible for you to set that deficiency right by your competence. Yet do not turn altogether away: [This] means do not deviate from the clear path of the command. Stop where you have been told to stop and do what you have been commanded to do. So that you leave her like one suspended: [This] means that when you prevent them from being with someone other than you even as you cut them off from any share of you you harm [them] in two ways for there is nothing to be had from you and there [is] no way for them to be with someone else. This harm is very grave. The allusion in this [verse] is that when the path to your share in worldly things is blocked He سبحانه enables you to witness His reality to you and find His kindness. Surely whoever's annihilation is in God fa-inna man kāna fī Allāh talafuhu the Real is his substitute fa-l-ḥaqq subḥānahu khalafuhu. If you set things right between you and other created beings wa-in tuṣliḥū mā baynakum wa-bayna al-khalq and put your trust in what is between you and the Real wa-tathiqū fīmā baynakum wa-bayna al-ḥaqq surely God is ever forgiving of your failings fa-inna Allāha ghafūrun li-ʿuyūbikum merciful in pardoning your sins raḥīmun bi-l-ʿafwi ʿan dhunūbikum.,{ وَإِن يَتَفَرَّقَا يُغْنِ ٱللَّهُ كُلاًّ مِّن سَعَتِهِ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ وَاسِعاً حَكِيماً }
But if they separate God will compensate each of them out of His plenty. God is ever Embracing Wise. The essential companionship is the companionship of the heart in per- petual need of God since there is no separating oneself from the Real. As for everything other than the Real [human beings] have no need for one another except in the external sense-this is the thinking of those in a state of separation aṣḥāb al-tafriqa. As for the people of realization ahl al-taḥqīq they have no doubt that the need of created beings is entirely for God سبحانه.,{ وَللَّهِ مَا فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَلَقَدْ وَصَّيْنَا ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ ٱلْكِتَابَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ وَإِيَّاكُمْ أَنِ ٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَإِن تَكْفُرُواْ فَإِنَّ للَّهِ مَا فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ غَنِيّاً حَمِيداً }
To God belongs all that is in the heavens and in the earth. We have charged those who were given the scripture before you and you [to] “Fear God.” “If you disbelieve then to God belongs all that is in the heavens and in the earth”; God is ever Independent Praised. [God] obligated everyone to return to Him and to avoid everything other than Him and to hold to His command but one party has been given suc- cess and another abandoned. Then He taught the people of realization that He is independent of the obedience of every friend ghanīyun ʿan Ṭāʿati kulli walīyin and innocent of the error of every one who strays wa-barīÌun ʿan zallati kulli ghawīyin.,{ وَللَّهِ مَا فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَكَفَىٰ بِٱللَّهِ وَكِيلاً }
To God belongs all that is in the heavens and in the earth; God suf- fices as a Guardian. [God] cuts off the innermost selves from attachment to anything but Him by informing them that He alone possesses what is in the heavens and the earth. Then He evokes desire in them for His superior guardianship and His attending to their needs with beautiful kindness and superior capability by His saying “God suffices as a Guardian. He sets things right by taking hold of your state without taking anything that is yours.”,{ إِن يَشَأْ يُذْهِبْكُمْ أَيُّهَا ٱلنَّاسُ وَيَأْتِ بِآخَرِينَ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ ذٰلِكَ قَدِيراً }
If He will He can remove you O people and bring others surely God is ever able to do that. One who is able to do without others in all eternity without beginning man istaghnā ʿanhu fī āzālihi has no need for them in all eternity without end fa-lā ḥājatin lahu ilayhi fī ābādihi. It is said that He has no need for any- one while the servant is unable to do without Him for even a single breath. It is said that there is no limit to the things which are decreed so that if it were not ʿAmr then it would be Zayd. If it were not a servant it would be servants. The only one for whom there is no substitute or replacement is the One the Unique.,{ مَّن كَانَ يُرِيدُ ثَوَابَ ٱلدُّنْيَا فَعِندَ ٱللَّهِ ثَوَابُ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَٱلآخِرَةِ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ سَمِيعاً بَصِيراً }
Whoever desires the reward of this world then God has the reward of this world and of the hereafter; God is ever Hearing Seeing. When they attached their hearts to what is transitory in this world He reminded them of what happens in the hereafter saying “then God has the reward of this world and of the hereafter.” This was to inform them that the blessing of the hereafter is far above what they aspire to in this paltry place. When the object of their search was elevated to the hereafter He cut them off from any external or created thing [saying] “And God is better and more enduring” [20:73].,{ يَٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ كُونُواْ قَوَّٰمِينَ بِٱلْقِسْطِ شُهَدَآءَ للَّهِ وَلَوْ عَلَىۤ أَنْفُسِكُمْ أَوِ ٱلْوَٰلِدَيْنِ وَٱلأَقْرَبِينَ إِن يَكُنْ غَنِيّاً أَوْ فَقِيراً فَٱللَّهُ أَوْلَىٰ بِهِمَا فَلاَ تَتَّبِعُواْ ٱلْهَوَىٰ أَن تَعْدِلُواْ وَإِن تَلْوُواْ أَوْ تُعْرِضُواْ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيراً }
O you who believe be upright in justice; witnesses for God even though it be against yourselves; or parents and kinsmen whether the person be rich or poor; God is closer to the two. So do not follow any whim lest you swerve for if you twist or refrain surely God is ever aware of what you do. “Justice” qisṬ is being fair and equitable ʿadl. “To be upright” for God in being fair and equitable is to uphold His rights against yourself and to seek the same from everyone over whom you have authority. This can be accomplished either through an exhortation to act kindly or a rebuke concerning something despicable admonitions direction to a legal issue or guidance to something that is the right thing to do ḥaqq. The deepest realization of what is right and true taḥqīq will not touch the innermost self of one who holds back what is rightly due ḥaqq to God. The founda- tion of religion is to prefer the right of the Real ḥaqq al-ḥaqq over the right of created beings ḥaqq al-khalq. Whoever prefers anyone-a father mother child kinsman or relation-to God or holds back any portion due to Him is not upright in justice.,{ يَٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ ءَامِنُواْ بِٱللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ وَٱلْكِتَٰبِ ٱلَّذِي نَزَّلَ عَلَىٰ رَسُولِهِ وَٱلْكِتَٰبِ ٱلَّذِيۤ أَنزَلَ مِن قَبْلُ وَمَن يَكْفُرْ بِٱللَّهِ وَمَلآئِكَتِهِ وَكُتُبِهِ وَرُسُلِهِ وَٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلآخِرِ فَقَدْ ضَلَّ ضَلاَلاً بَعِيداً }
O you who believe believe in God and His Messenger and the Book which has been revealed to His Messenger; and the Book which was revealed before. And whoever disbelieves in God and His angels and His Books and His messengers and the Last Day verily he has strayed far away. “O you who believe from the point of view of demonstrative proof burhān believe from the point of view of clear evidence bayān until you believe from the point of view of unveiling kashf and eyewitnessing ʿiyān.” It is said: “O you who believe through affirmation taṣdīq believe by recognizing the truth taḥqīq that your salvation comes through His favor not through your belief.” It is said: “O you who believe in the present ḥāl believe with unwaver- ing belief up to the end maÌāl.” It is said: “O you who believe believe that He is beyond every union and separation waṣl wa-faṣl finding and losing wajd wa-faqd.” It is said “O you who believe through the use of the proofs of intel- lects adillat al-ʿuqūl: When you alight in the courtyard of arriving and the bewilderment of sudden intuition and the forces of perplexity take possession of you and you then awaken from this state of absence [from creation] believe that that which overwhelmed you was the witness of the Real kāna shāhida al-ḥaqq not the reality Itself lā ḥaqīqata al-dhāt for the Eternal is too sanctified and holy for any nearness and distance union and separation.”,{ إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ ثُمَّ كَفَرُواْ ثُمَّ آمَنُواْ ثُمَّ كَفَرُواْ ثُمَّ ٱزْدَادُواْ كُفْراً لَّمْ يَكُنِ ٱللَّهُ لِيَغْفِرَ لَهُمْ وَلاَ لِيَهْدِيَهُمْ سَبِيلاً } * { بَشِّرِ ٱلْمُنَافِقِينَ بِأَنَّ لَهُمْ عَذَاباً أَلِيماً }
Verily those who believed and then disbelieved and then believed and then disbelieved and then increased in disbelief-it was not for God to forgive them nor to guide them to a way. Give tidings to the hypocrites that for them there is a painful chastisement. Those whose states have alternated so that they rise and fall then rise up again and then stumble -He has sealed their states in their unseemliness. The arrows of divine power have struck them by decree and the misery of fate has caught up with them as their final state. The Real سبحانه will not guide them to a purpose nor lead them to good sense. “Give tidings to them of separation without end fa-bashshirhum bi-l-furqati al-abadiyya and tell them of punishment uninterrupted wa-akhbirhum bi-l-ʿuqūbati al-sarmadiyya.”,{ إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ ثُمَّ كَفَرُواْ ثُمَّ آمَنُواْ ثُمَّ كَفَرُواْ ثُمَّ ٱزْدَادُواْ كُفْراً لَّمْ يَكُنِ ٱللَّهُ لِيَغْفِرَ لَهُمْ وَلاَ لِيَهْدِيَهُمْ سَبِيلاً } * { بَشِّرِ ٱلْمُنَافِقِينَ بِأَنَّ لَهُمْ عَذَاباً أَلِيماً }

Those who take disbelievers for friends instead of believers-do they desire power with themḍ Truly power belongs altogether to God. It has been revealed to you in the Book that: “When you hear God's signs being disbelieved and mocked do not sit with them until they engage in some other talk for otherwise you would surely be like them.” God will gather the hypocrites and disbelievers all together into hell. Whoever clings to a created being has sought refuge with someone other than the One who protects. He relies on a place that will provide no shelter. He has fallen into the abyss of error whose depth is bottomless and ruse calamitous. Do they desire power with those who have themselves been humbled by [the command] to “Be”ḍ How can they have any power to determine the truthḍ How can those who have no power extend power to anyone elseḍ It is said that “We do not know what is more shameless in their condi- tion: seeking power while they are themselves humbled by the [divine] subjugation and held in the [divine] grasp or their thinking and imagining that [power] can be from anything other than God.” It is said that whoever seeks something from any direction other than Him-failure is the ultimate end of his effort fa-l-ikhfāqu ghāyatu jahdihi. Whoever desires wealth in regions of indigence-being reduced to poverty is the outcome of his toil fa-l-imlāqu quṣārā kaddihi. It is said that if they had been rightly guided to finding [the true source of] power their seeking would not have been diverted to those who pos- sess no authority. Truly power belongs altogether to God: The power is of two kinds: an eternal power which is an attribute of God and a contingent power which He سبحانه apportions to whomever He will. [Power] belongs to God most high as something that is His and is [also] a gift from Him [to human beings]. It has been revealed to you in the Book... Do not make neighbors of those alienated in feeling and affection for the darknesses of their souls extend to your hearts as you seek to inhale the fragrances they refuse to take in. One becomes partner to the state of those with whom one sits. The sit- ting companion of those in a state of intimacy becomes an intimate himself while the sitting companion of those in darkness is himself estranged.,{ ٱلَّذِينَ يَتَّخِذُونَ ٱلْكَافِرِينَ أَوْلِيَآءَ مِن دُونِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ أَيَبْتَغُونَ عِندَهُمُ ٱلْعِزَّةَ فَإِنَّ ٱلعِزَّةَ للَّهِ جَمِيعاً } * { وَقَدْ نَزَّلَ عَلَيْكُمْ فِي ٱلْكِتَٰبِ أَنْ إِذَا سَمِعْتُمْ آيَاتِ ٱللَّهِ يُكْفَرُ بِهَا وَيُسْتَهْزَأُ بِهَا فَلاَ تَقْعُدُواْ مَعَهُمْ حَتَّىٰ يَخُوضُواْ فِي حَدِيثٍ غَيْرِهِ إِنَّكُمْ إِذاً مِّثْلُهُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ جَامِعُ ٱلْمُنَٰفِقِينَ وَٱلْكَٰفِرِينَ فِي جَهَنَّمَ جَمِيعاً }

Those who wait in watch for you and if a victory comes to you from God say “Were we not with youḍ”; but if the disbelievers have some luck they say “did we not gain mastery over you and did we not defend you against the believersḍ” God will judge between you on the Day of Resurrection and God will never grant the disbelievers a way over the believers. Because they lacked sincerity ikhlāṣ in the truest sense and had not tasted true conviction ʿaqīda they showed themselves to be of a different char- acter from those who in the [divine] decree submitted. [Those who sub- mitted] and the disbelievers are not the same. It is necessary for the people of the Real to be wary of [the disbelievers] and to stay aloof from them. Then He سبحانه included a beautiful expression of His sufficiency for them by His saying “God will never grant the disbelievers a way over the believers” which is an all-encompassing statement. Surely the evil of their deception is diverted back to them fa-inna wabāla kaydihim ilayhim maṣrūfun and the requital for their plotting is reserved for them wa-jazāÌa makrihim ʿalayhim mawqūfun. The right and true reality-its people are aided from the power of the Real سبحانه wa-l-ḥaqqu min qibali al-ḥaqqi subḥānihi manṣūrun ahluhu. The false-its foundation is uprooted through the help of the Real سبحانه wa-l-bāṬilu bi-naṣri al-ḥaqqi subḥānihi mujtaththun aṣluhu.,{ إِنَّ ٱلْمُنَافِقِينَ يُخَادِعُونَ ٱللَّهَ وَهُوَ خَادِعُهُمْ وَإِذَا قَامُوۤاْ إِلَى ٱلصَّلاَةِ قَامُواْ كُسَالَىٰ يُرَآءُونَ ٱلنَّاسَ وَلاَ يَذْكُرُونَ ٱللَّهَ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً } * { مُّذَبْذَبِينَ بَيْنَ ذٰلِكَ لاَ إِلَىٰ هَـٰؤُلاۤءِ وَلاَ إِلَى هَـٰؤُلاۤءِ وَمَن يُضْلِلِ ٱللَّهُ فَلَن تَجِدَ لَهُ سَبِيلاً }
The hypocrites seek to trick God but He is tricking them. When they stand up to pray they stand up lazily and to be seen by people and they do not remember God save a little. Wavering all the time-not to these neither to those; and he whom God sends astray you will never find for him a way. The trickery of the hypocrites is the outward display of conformity on the path iẓhāru al-wifāqi fī l-Ṭarīqa while inwardly [they] cling to association [of others with God] in [their] creed wa-istishʿāru al-shirki fī l-ʿaqīda. The trickery of the Real toward them is what they imagine regarding salvation [after they] decided they have a special entitlement to it. But when the covering is lifted they will know for certain that what they thought was drink sharāb was a mirage sarāb. God most high said “And there will appear to them from God that which they had never reckoned” [39:47]. When they stand up to pray... The sign of hypocrisy is finding energy when one can be seen by others but then losing resolve when the oppor- tunity to be seen passes. Wavering all the time... Those who are worth the least among created beings are those who remove the vest of servanthood akhassu al-khalqi man yadaʿu ṣidāra al-ʿubūdiyya and have not found a way to true freedom wa-lam yajid sabīlan ilā ḥaqīqati al-ḥurriyya.

O you who believe take not the disbelievers as friends instead of the believers: do you desire to give God over you a clear warrantḍ He repeated the admonition to them and confirmed the command to separate themselves from enemies. This was to emphasize the warning strengthen the prohibition and end the argument by putting a stop to any possible excuses. Do you desire to give God over you a clear warrantḍ He warned them about their friendship with the disbelievers over and above other oppo- sitional acts because it involves a preference for something other than the [appropriate] object of adoration maʿbūd. Preferring another to the beloved maḥbūb is the gravest of sins in the precepts of love aḥkām al-widād. When one's heart becomes engaged with others in the place reserved for believers this necessarily brings about a bad outcome. How should one's heart be engaged with others in the place reserved for the Realḍ The punishment He promised them was to leave them to their own devices and to what they had chosen [when they] sided with the disbeliev- ers. What a wretched substitution! It is the same with those who remain apart from the Real ḥaqq-He leaves them with created beings khalq. He doubles their affliction by their remaining apart from the Real lil-baqāÌi ʿan al-ḥaqq and remaining with created beings wa-l-baqāÌi maʿa al-khalq. Both of these are severe punishments.,{ إِنَّ ٱلْمُنَافِقِينَ فِي ٱلدَّرْكِ ٱلأَسْفَلِ مِنَ ٱلنَّارِ وَلَن تَجِدَ لَهُمْ نَصِيراً }
Verily the hypocrites will be in the lowest level of the fire; and you will never find a helper for them. This verse indicates that the hypocrite is not one who is sincerely seeking the protective trust mustaÌmin for being true to the trust īmān is what brings protection amān. The one who holds true to the trust muÌmin [or “the believer”] is saved by his faith īmān from the fire-that which causes one's falling to the lowest level of the fire cannot be called faith īmān. It is said that this is verified by His words God is the best of schem- ers [3:54 and 8:30] which is to say His scheming makr is superior to all other scheming. When the hypocrites' scheming with the believers was exposed their punishment was more severe than the punishment of those who declared their disbelief openly. Because of what is in the tradition “One meets God in whatever state one is in” it is said that He transfers them from their present state to one like it in the future. Just as today the hypocrites are in the lowest level of being cut off [from the communion of lovers] so will they be transferred to the lowest level of the fire. The lowest level of their being cut off in the present is that they bear the name of “faith” īmān while in fact they do not have even a sliver from God. This is the greatest of afflictions. It is said that they deserve the lowest level of the fire because they kept company here with the greatest name of God without respect ḥurma. It is said that they deserve [the lowest level of the fire] because they were present but lacked any sense of propriety adab in what they said. By this they were driven far away.,{ إِلاَّ ٱلَّذِينَ تَابُواْ وَأَصْلَحُواْ وَٱعْتَصَمُواْ بِٱللَّهِ وَأَخْلَصُواْ دِينَهُمْ للَّهِ فَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ مَعَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَسَوْفَ يُؤْتِ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ أَجْراً عَظِيماً }
Save those who repent and make amends and hold fast to God and make their religion purely God's; those are with the believers; and God will certainly give the believers a great wage. Although not all of these conditions are ordinarily required to repent of one's sin they are necessary for hypocrites to renounce their hypocrisy because of the recalcitrant nature of their disbelief. For those who meet these conditions He said “those are with maʿa the believers.” He did not say “of ” min the believers. In this there is another allusion to the imperfection in their rank even though they have sincerely made amends for the evil they did in the past. Regarding its meaning they have recited: Apologies are easy. What a difference between apologies and thankfulness! [Others] say that the preposition “with” maʿa indicates accompani- ment so that when they were included with the believers they became deserving in the same way as the group of the believers. Here repentance tawba means that they renounce their hypocrisy and make amends in the sincerity ṣidq of their faith and hold fast to God in absolving themselves of their own power and strength and bearing witness to the blessing of God toward them in guiding them and delivering them from their hypocrisy and make their religion purely God's. They regard their deliverance as being by the grace of God not by their newfound faith nor by the renouncement of their past hypocrisy. It is said that they make their religion purely God's means [that they] perpetually seek God's help in strengthening them in faith and protecting them from reverting to their past hypocrisy. It is said that they repent from hypocrisy and make amends through the purification of belief and hold fast to God by asking for His favor and make their religion purely God's in that their deliverance is by the grace and kindness of God not by their having done anything to make it happen.,{ مَّا يَفْعَلُ ٱللَّهُ بِعَذَابِكُمْ إِن شَكَرْتُمْ وَآمَنْتُمْ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ شَاكِراً عَلِيماً }
Why would God chastise you if you are thankful and believeḍ God is ever Thankful Knowing. This verse is among the verses which evoke beautiful hope and powerful optimism because He has appointed two things as tokens of protection from punishment. These are thankfulness shukr and belief īmān which are simple and light-hearted qualities. Thankfulness or praise is an asser- tion qāla and belief or faith is a state ḥāla. When He is pleased with a servant's words and state He makes the way easy for him. Thankfulness or praise shukr is only sound when heard from one who is faithful rather than one who is not because it is an act of willing obedience Ṭāʿa. The obedience of those who have no faith is not genuine. And believe that is [believe or come to believe] in the end. It is as if He is explaining that salvation will only be for those who at the end of the day believe. The meaning of the verse then is that God will not chastise you with the chastisement of abiding [in hell] if you are thankful in your present state and believe in the end. It is said that when you are thankful and believe you attest to the fact that your salvation [comes] through God not through your thankfulness or your belief. It is said that thankfulness is witnessing the blessing from God and belief is seeing God in the blessing. It is as if He said “If you understand the blessing as coming from God then let not the witnessing of this blessing cut you off from witnessing the One who gives the blessing.” Wa kāna Allāh shākiran ʿalīman means God is ever Thankful Knowing Allāh shākirun ʿalīmun. The meaning of His being “thankful” is that He is the One who commends the servant and the One who bears witness to him in what he does. This is because the true sense and definition of thankfulness is praise for the one who acts in a beautiful way muḥsin by mentioning the beautiful action he does iḥsān. “The servant gives thanks to God” means he praises Him for His beautiful action iḥsān toward him which is His blessing to him. “The Lord gives thanks to the servant” means that He praises [the servant] for his beautiful action iḥsān which is his willing obedience Ṭāʿa to Him.,{ لاَّ يُحِبُّ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْجَهْرَ بِٱلسُّوۤءِ مِنَ ٱلْقَوْلِ إِلاَّ مَن ظُلِمَ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ سَمِيعاً عَلِيماً }
God does not like the utterance of evil words out loud unless a person has been wronged. God is ever Hearer Knower. What a person who has been wronged says about the one who has wronged him is not evil in the true sense of the word by the permission of God but it is nonetheless a good thing to let the matter drop. God most high has said “For the requital of an evil is an evil deed like it” [42:40] so requital is not an evil deed. [But whoever pardons and reconciles his reward will be with God. Truly He does not like wrongdoers] [42:40]. It is said that anyone who knows that his Protector hears is ashamed to give free voice to the urgings of his lower self. It is said that evil words out loud are what you hear within yourself [when] you think ill thoughts about others. The elect take responsibility in their inward thoughts for that which if heard [out loud] from ordinary people might be held against them. Unless illā a person has been wronged: Some say [this means] “not even wa-lā the one who has been wronged.” Others say its meaning is this: “But wa-lakinna a person who has been wronged” has the right to mention the one who has intentionally wronged him. It is said that those who do not prefer praise of the Real madḥ al-ḥaqq over defaming one's fellow creatures qadḥ al-khalq have been cheated of the present moment. It is said that those who look to created beings with the eye of connect- ing to the Real [see] that they are servants of God [and] will speak no ill of them. A man says to his companion “Out of respect for you I will bear the lowliest149 service to you even beyond that which I would bear for my son.” When there is commitment like this between human beings how much more worthy is the servant's regard for refined behavior adab between him and His Protector! It is said that God does not like the utterance of evil words out loud among ordinary people nor does He like that in the inward thoughts of the elect. It is said that the utterance of evil words out loud among ordinary people is their description of God in ways [for which they] have no permission or divine sanction.,{ إِن تُبْدُواْ خَيْراً أَوْ تُخْفُوهُ أَوْ تَعْفُواْ عَن سُوۤءٍ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ عَفُوّاً قَدِيراً }
If you show good or conceal it or pardon evil then surely God is ever Pardoning Powerful. If you show good taking on the good manners found in the law takhal- luqan bi-ādābi al-sharīʿa or conceal recognizing the truth in the precepts of the deeper reality taḥaqquqan bi-aḥkāmi al-ḥaqīqa or pardon evil adopting from God what He has entrusted you with in the most beauti- ful ways of behaving then surely God is ever Pardoning of your defects li-ʿuyūbikum Powerful in causing you to attain what you love ʿalā taḥsīli maḥbūbikum and causing you to recognize the true nature of what you seek wa-taḥqīqi maṬlūbikum. It is said that if you show good you will be an example for humankind in what you practice and in what you propose to others who might be guided from the way of your practice. If you conceal it content with only His knowing it and safeguard yourselves from the evils of affectation and trust that those of you who act for Him will be seen and known by Him or pardon evil that is you abandon150 what your lower selves call you to-then God will grant you His pardon for what you do. He [also] has the power to afflict you with that which the oppressor is afflicted with. This then is a warning to them about being heedless in witnessing the favor minna and a way of alerting them to the fact that they should seek refuge from being deprived of protection ʿiṣma and seek refuge from being abandoned so that they fall into discord fitna and trial miḥna. It is said [the verse means] if you show good acting well toward people or conceal it praying for them in secret or pardon evil even if you have been wronged [then surely God is ever Pardoning Powerful]. It is said concerning those who act well toward you show them good outwardly. Those who spare you from their evil be loyal in friendship and pray for them inwardly. Those who act badly toward you pardon them with generosity and graciousness. You will find pardon from God according to what you yourself do for surely your sins are more numerous. He has the power to give you in favor and blessings that which you cannot attain by taking vengeance or revenge.,{ إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يَكْفُرُونَ بِٱللَّهِ وَرُسُلِهِ وَيُرِيدُونَ أَن يُفَرِّقُواْ بَيْنَ ٱللَّهِ وَرُسُلِهِ وَيقُولُونَ نُؤْمِنُ بِبَعْضٍ وَنَكْفُرُ بِبَعْضٍ وَيُرِيدُونَ أَن يَتَّخِذُواْ بَيْنَ ذٰلِكَ سَبِيلاً } * { أُوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْكَافِرُونَ حَقّاً وَأَعْتَدْنَا لِلْكَافِرِينَ عَذَاباً مُّهِيناً }
Those who disbelieve in God and His messengers and seek to divide between God and His messengers and say “We believe in some and disbelieve in some” and seek to adopt a way between them. Those are the disbelievers truly; and We have prepared for the disbe- lievers a humiliating chastisement. [God] relates that they have added the blameworthy actions enumerated here to the shamefulness of their disbelief. He explains that He has doubled their chastisement as requital for their sin so that you will know that He is ever on the watch [89:14] over those who act in corrupt and harmful ways.,{ إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يَكْفُرُونَ بِٱللَّهِ وَرُسُلِهِ وَيُرِيدُونَ أَن يُفَرِّقُواْ بَيْنَ ٱللَّهِ وَرُسُلِهِ وَيقُولُونَ نُؤْمِنُ بِبَعْضٍ وَنَكْفُرُ بِبَعْضٍ وَيُرِيدُونَ أَن يَتَّخِذُواْ بَيْنَ ذٰلِكَ سَبِيلاً } * { أُوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْكَافِرُونَ حَقّاً وَأَعْتَدْنَا لِلْكَافِرِينَ عَذَاباً مُّهِيناً }

And those who believe in God and His messengers and do not seek to divide between any of them those-We shall surely give them their wages. God is ever Forgiving Merciful. When they believed in all of the messengers and confirmed everything to which they were commanded they deserved acceptance and the beautiful recompense. To let go of one's faith in some individuals is to let go of one's faith in [the messages sent in other] time periods. Just as [God] will not accept the faith of a person whose faith does not include all the messages that have come before him likewise He will not accept the faith of a per- son whose faith does not include all that faith demands of him since [God] made that a condition for its actualization taḥqīq and perfection kamāl. This alludes to the fact that anyone who does not wholeheartedly enter into the covenant will not have so much as a sliver of the reality of com- munion [of lovers]. The Prophet ﷺ said “The pilgrimage is [the day of] ʿArafa.” Anyone who traverses the distance even if he comes from a deep ravine but then holds back even a little from ʿArafāt has not experienced the pilgrimage. The Prophet ﷺ said “The servant who has contracted with his master to be freed is still a servant to the last dirham.”,{ يَسْأَلُكَ أَهْلُ ٱلْكِتَابِ أَن تُنَزِّلَ عَلَيْهِمْ كِتَاباً مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ فَقَدْ سَأَلُواْ مُوسَىٰ أَكْبَرَ مِن ذٰلِكَ فَقَالُوۤاْ أَرِنَا ٱللَّهَ جَهْرَةً فَأَخَذَتْهُمُ ٱلصَّاعِقَةُ بِظُلْمِهِمْ ثُمَّ ٱتَّخَذُواْ ٱلْعِجْلَ مِن بَعْدِ مَا جَآءَتْهُمُ ٱلْبَيِّنَاتُ فَعَفَوْنَا عَن ذٰلِكَ وَآتَيْنَا مُوسَىٰ سُلْطَاناً مُّبِيناً }
The people of the scripture will ask of you to cause a Book to be revealed to them from the heaven. They asked Moses for something greater than that for they said “show us God openly”; so the thunderbolt seized them for their evildoing. They then took to themselves the [golden] calf after clear proofs had come to them; yet We pardoned that; and We bestowed upon Moses clear authority. The verse includes two kinds of unseemly acts. The first was their asking to be shown [God] and the second was their worshiping the calf after clear signs had been made manifest to them. Their asking to be shown [God] was blameworthy because they impudently demanded it and there was no excuse for this after miracles had come to them. Therefore they were not seeking the vision for instruction nor as a means to confirm their faith nor were they brought to that [point] by intense longing. This shows a lack of manners sūÌ adab. There is an allusion [in the reference] to those who are content to have the calf as their object of worship. While submitting themselves to it how can they bear witness to the Realḍ It is said that the innermost selves of the people were untouched by deeper knowledge and they therefore clung with their intellects to a lim- ited thing maḥdūd allowing that to be their object of worship maʿbūd. And we bestowed upon Moses clear authority: a manifest proof-indeed a light that preserved him from declaring any likeness [to God] tamthīl or stripping [Him] of His attributes taʿṬīl. The clear authority is actualization taḥṣīl and declaring God incom- parable tanzīh neither stripping God of His attributes taʿṬīl nor compar- ing Him to His creation tashbīh. It is said that the clear authority is the power to hear the [divine] speech al-khiṬāb without intermediary. It is said that the clear authority belongs to this community in the future and it is their abiding in the state of meeting [God]. In the tradition of the vision [the Prophet] ﷺ said “You will not be gathered together [in one group] in seeing Him.”,{ وَرَفَعْنَا فَوْقَهُمُ ٱلطُّورَ بِمِيثَاقِهِمْ وَقُلْنَا لَهُمُ ٱدْخُلُواْ ٱلْبَابَ سُجَّداً وَقُلْنَا لَهُمْ لاَ تَعْدُواْ فِي ٱلسَّبْتِ وَأَخَذْنَا مِنْهُمْ مِّيثَاقاً غَلِيظاً }
And We raised above them the mount by the covenant with them and We said to them “Enter the gate bowing”; and We said to them “Transgress not the Sabbath and We took from them a firm covenant. The more signs were given to them outwardly the more denial and rejec- tion there was in their hearts. Receiving more communications did not benefit them since the eyes of their hearts were not open to witnessing [these communications]. God most high said “But signs and warners do not avail a folk who will not believe” [10:101].,{ فَبِمَا نَقْضِهِم مِّيثَاقَهُمْ وَكُفْرِهِم بَآيَاتِ ٱللَّهِ وَقَتْلِهِمُ ٱلأَنْبِيَآءَ بِغَيْرِ حَقٍّ وَقَوْلِهِمْ قُلُوبُنَا غُلْفٌ بَلْ طَبَعَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْهَا بِكُفْرِهِمْ فَلاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً }
So for their breaking their covenant and disbelieving in the signs of God and slaying the prophets wrongfully and for their saying “Our hearts are covered up”-nay but God sealed them for their disbelief; so they do not believe except for a few. Its meaning is: Because they committed these prohibited acts li-irtikābihim hādhihi al-manāhī and because they were marked by acts that deserve punishment wa-li-ittiṣāfihim bi-hādhihi al-majāzī We caused them to alight at the dwellings of disgrace aḥlalnāhum manāzila al-hawān and sent down upon them punishments of all kinds wa-anzalnā bihim min al-ʿuqūbati funūna al-alwān. It is said that the misfortune of their oppositional acts affected them cumulatively. One of the consequences of acting disobediently is being left to commit even more prohibited acts. By violating the covenant and not repenting they were pulled toward disbelief in [God's] signs. Then because of the misfortune of this disbelief they were left to themselves until they slew the prophets عليه السلام wrongfully. Then because of the misfortune of [these ever more shameful acts] they had the audacity to claim a keen ability to comprehend saying “Our hearts are the vessels for all kinds of knowledge.” God replied to them “but God sealed them for their dis- belief.” He hid the place of deeper knowledge ʿirfān from them and they wandered about in their errors.,{ وَبِكُفْرِهِمْ وَقَوْلِهِمْ عَلَىٰ مَرْيَمَ بُهْتَاناً عَظِيماً }
And for their disbelief and their uttering against Mary a tremendous calumny. To transgress the limit is error just as it is error to diminish or subtract from the truth. Some people slandered Mary and accused her of fornication. Others transgressed the limit in a terrible calumny saying her son was the son of God. Both of these groups fell into error. It is said that Mary [عليه السلام] was a friend waliyya of God through whom two groups become miserable: those who exceed all bounds ahl al-ifrāṬ and those who fall short ahl al-tafrīṬ. This is also how it is with His friends-those who reject [the friends] suffer from their lack of respect for them and those who believe things about [the friends] that cannot be said of them suffer from their excessive adulation of them. This is something that most of the great ones have had to endure.,{ وَقَوْلِهِمْ إِنَّا قَتَلْنَا ٱلْمَسِيحَ عِيسَى ٱبْنَ مَرْيَمَ رَسُولَ ٱللَّهِ وَمَا قَتَلُوهُ وَمَا صَلَبُوهُ وَلَـٰكِن شُبِّهَ لَهُمْ وَإِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱخْتَلَفُواْ فِيهِ لَفِي شَكٍّ مِّنْهُ مَا لَهُمْ بِهِ مِنْ عِلْمٍ إِلاَّ ٱتِّبَاعَ ٱلظَّنِّ وَمَا قَتَلُوهُ يَقِيناً } * { بَل رَّفَعَهُ ٱللَّهُ إِلَيْهِ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ عَزِيزاً حَكِيماً }
And for their saying “We slew the Messiah Jesus son of Mary the Messenger of God.” And yet they did not slay him nor did they crucify him but he was given the resemblance. And those who disagree concerning him are surely in doubt regarding him. They do not have any knowledge of him only the pursuit of conjecture; and they did not slay him for certain. Nay God raised him up to Him. God is ever Mighty Wise. It is said that God caused the one who slandered [Jesus] to resemble him and he was killed and crucified in his place. There is a saying that one who digs a grave for his brother falls into it. It is [also] said that Jesus عليه السلام said “Whoever agrees to have my resem- blance cast upon him so that he is killed in place of me will have the garden” and one of his companions agreed. It is said that because [this companion] patiently bore the injury talaf he was not deprived of the recompense khalaf from God. God most high said “Indeed We do not leave the reward of those of good deeds to go to waste” [18:30]. It is said that because this man who was a companion of Jesus عليه السلام was without any imperfection in his lower self nafs he became [Jesus's] friend in spirit rūḥ. When Jesus عليه السلام was raised up to the place of intimacy maḥall al-zulfa the spirit of this one who ransomed [Jesus] with his lower self was raised up to the place of nearness maḥall al-qurba.,{ وَقَوْلِهِمْ إِنَّا قَتَلْنَا ٱلْمَسِيحَ عِيسَى ٱبْنَ مَرْيَمَ رَسُولَ ٱللَّهِ وَمَا قَتَلُوهُ وَمَا صَلَبُوهُ وَلَـٰكِن شُبِّهَ لَهُمْ وَإِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱخْتَلَفُواْ فِيهِ لَفِي شَكٍّ مِّنْهُ مَا لَهُمْ بِهِ مِنْ عِلْمٍ إِلاَّ ٱتِّبَاعَ ٱلظَّنِّ وَمَا قَتَلُوهُ يَقِيناً } * { بَل رَّفَعَهُ ٱللَّهُ إِلَيْهِ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ عَزِيزاً حَكِيماً }

And there is not one of the people of the scripture but will assuredly believe in him before his death; and on the Day of Resurrection he will be a witness against them. Because He determined that there will be no protection amān granted to them at the time of despair their faith īmān at that time will not benefit them. This tells us that what is taken into consideration [comes from] the protection āmān granted by the Real not from the faith īmān of the servant.,{ فَبِظُلْمٍ مِّنَ ٱلَّذِينَ هَادُواْ حَرَّمْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ طَيِّبَاتٍ أُحِلَّتْ لَهُمْ وَبِصَدِّهِمْ عَن سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ كَثِيراً } * { وَأَخْذِهِمُ ٱلرِّبَا وَقَدْ نُهُواْ عَنْهُ وَأَكْلِهِمْ أَمْوَالَ ٱلنَّاسِ بِٱلْبَاطِلِ وَأَعْتَدْنَا لِلْكَافِرِينَ مِنْهُمْ عَذَاباً أَلِيماً }
And because of the evildoing of some of those of the Jews We have forbidden them certain good things that were lawful for them and because of their barring from God's way many. And because of their taking usury when they had been forbidden it and their consuming people's wealth through falsehood and We have prepared for the disbelievers among them a painful chastisement. It is said that committing prohibited acts leads to the forbidding of what had been permitted. Whoever commits a prohibited act with his outward self is forbidden that which he used to find in his permitted states and the subtle kindnesses received in his innermost self.,{ فَبِظُلْمٍ مِّنَ ٱلَّذِينَ هَادُواْ حَرَّمْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ طَيِّبَاتٍ أُحِلَّتْ لَهُمْ وَبِصَدِّهِمْ عَن سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ كَثِيراً } * { وَأَخْذِهِمُ ٱلرِّبَا وَقَدْ نُهُواْ عَنْهُ وَأَكْلِهِمْ أَمْوَالَ ٱلنَّاسِ بِٱلْبَاطِلِ وَأَعْتَدْنَا لِلْكَافِرِينَ مِنْهُمْ عَذَاباً أَلِيماً }

But those of them who are firmly rooted in knowledge and the believ- ers believing in what has been revealed to you and what was revealed before you and those who observe the prayer; and pay the alms and those who believe in God and the Last Day-to them We shall surely give a great wage. The one who is firmly rooted in knowledge ʿilm is not a blind follower in matters of proof dalīl just as he is not a blind follower in matters of judg- ment ḥukm. Rather he replaces [blind following] with reflective thought naẓar to the point that there is no possibility of doubt in his intellectual understanding ʿaql. It is said that the one who is firmly rooted in knowledge ascends from the limit of the study of demonstrative proof burhān and reaches the realities of clear evidence bayān. It is said that the one who is firmly rooted in knowledge is one whose knowledge is practiced to the degree that he benefits from knowledge that is hidden from others as in the tradition “Whoever practices what he knows-God grants knowledge of what he does not know.” [The phrase] those who observe prayer is in the accusative to indi- cate the laudative. Prayer is given distinction among the other acts of worship because it follows [the mention of] faith in most passages in the QurÌān and because God سبحانه gave the command for prayer directly to the Messenger ﷺ on the night of the miʿrāj without the intermediary of Gabriel عليه السلام and because of other reasons. A great wage: The great wage is that which is over and above what the work deserves,{ إِنَّآ أَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَيْكَ كَمَآ أَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَىٰ نُوحٍ وَٱلنَّبِيِّينَ مِن بَعْدِهِ وَأَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَىٰ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَإِسْمَاعِيلَ وَإسْحَاقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ وَٱلأَسْبَاطِ وَعِيسَىٰ وَأَيُّوبَ وَيُونُسَ وَهَارُونَ وَسُلَيْمَانَ وَآتَيْنَا دَاوُودَ زَبُوراً }
We have revealed to you as We revealed to Noah and the prophets after him and We revealed to Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the tribes and Jesus and Job and Jonah and Aaron and Solomon and We gave to David the inscribed Book. The singularity of the Prophet ﷺ among the prophets is in [the call to] believe in the singularity of [all of them] in distinction and merit. [God] singled out Noah based on what he deserved in station and singled out Our Messenger عليه السلام based on what he deserved. They shared in being singled out because each illustrated [his] merit according to [his] station. One was without parallel among his kind in ten virtues and the other was with- out parallel among his class in a thousand virtues. Both were singled out [by God] but one has ten virtues while the other has a thousand virtues.,{ وَرُسُلاً قَدْ قَصَصْنَاهُمْ عَلَيْكَ مِن قَبْلُ وَرُسُلاً لَّمْ نَقْصُصْهُمْ عَلَيْكَ وَكَلَّمَ ٱللَّهُ مُوسَىٰ تَكْلِيماً }
And messengers We have told you of before and messengers We have not told you of; and God spoke directly to Moses. God's way sunna regarding his friends awliyāÌ is to veil some and to make others known. This is also His way with the prophets [عليه السلام]. He pro- claims the names of some and refers to others in a general way. Belief is obligatory in all the prophets as a whole and individually just as respect is obligatory for all of the friends as a whole and individually. Likewise He veils some of the states of the servants and makes others apparent. He asks for purity and sincerity with regard to what He makes apparent to them. With regard to what He veils from them He jealously protects their hearts from viewing these states as an entitlement that gives them special claim to the meanings of the realities He has singled out for them. [His words] and God spoke directly to Moses tell of His selecting [Moses] to hear His speech without intermediary.,{ رُّسُلاً مُّبَشِّرِينَ وَمُنذِرِينَ لِئَلاَّ يَكُونَ لِلنَّاسِ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ حُجَّةٌ بَعْدَ ٱلرُّسُلِ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ عَزِيزاً حَكِيماً }
messengers bearing good tidings and warning so that people might have no argument against God after the messengers. God is ever Mighty Wise. He informed created beings of the measure of [the messengers'] worth. He explained that He sent the messengers to them and that they should look to them alone for the gathering of their reward and to avoid what would make them deserving of punishment. [He explained] that created beings have no [other] way to the comfort they seek or the hurt they wish to avoid in the present or in the end. So that people might have no argument against God after the mes- sengers. God is ever Mighty Wise: How could one who has need ḥāja of God have an argument ḥujja against Godḍ But God addressed them in accordance with their understandings.,{ لَّـٰكِنِ ٱللَّهُ يَشْهَدُ بِمَآ أَنزَلَ إِلَيْكَ أَنزَلَهُ بِعِلْمِهِ وَٱلْمَلاۤئِكَةُ يَشْهَدُونَ وَكَفَىٰ بِٱللَّهِ شَهِيداً }
But God bears witness with what He has revealed to you; He has revealed it through His knowledge; and the angels also bear witness; and God suffices as a Witness. In mentioning His knowledge of [the Prophet's] sincerity God consoled him for the lies that created beings told about him. For this reason He said “God suffices as a Witness.”,{ إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَصَدُّواْ عَن سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ قَدْ ضَلُّواْ ضَلَٰلاً بَعِيداً } * { إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَظَلَمُواْ لَمْ يَكُنِ ٱللَّهُ لِيَغْفِرَ لَهُمْ وَلاَ لِيَهْدِيَهُمْ طَرِيقاً } * { إِلاَّ طَرِيقَ جَهَنَّمَ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَآ أَبَداً وَكَانَ ذٰلِكَ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ يَسِيراً }
Surely those who disbelieve and bar [people] from the way of God they have indeed gone far astray. Surely those who disbelieve and who have done wrong it is not for God to forgive them neither to guide them to any path except for the path of hell abiding therein forever; and for God that is an easy matter. He made their barring believers from following the truth the equivalent of their disbelief in God. [In equating these two] God most high treats the rights of His friends as seriously as He treats His own right. Then He said surely those who disbelieve and who have done wrong. He made their wrongdoing ẓulm the same as their disbelief kufr and attached to both of these the justly deserved abiding punishment. Even if wrongdoing is not like disbelief in deserving the threat of endless duration the misfortune of it is that God may abandon those who do it until they succumb to disbelief.,{ إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَصَدُّواْ عَن سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ قَدْ ضَلُّواْ ضَلَٰلاً بَعِيداً } * { إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَظَلَمُواْ لَمْ يَكُنِ ٱللَّهُ لِيَغْفِرَ لَهُمْ وَلاَ لِيَهْدِيَهُمْ طَرِيقاً } * { إِلاَّ طَرِيقَ جَهَنَّمَ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَآ أَبَداً وَكَانَ ذٰلِكَ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ يَسِيراً }

O people the Messenger has now come to you with the truth from your Lord; so believe it is better for you. And if you disbelieve then surely to God belongs all that is in the heavens and in the earth; and God is ever Knowing Wise. He states that He سبحانه is not in need of them. If they believe they will have acquired good fortune for themselves fa-ḥuẓūẓu anfusihim iktasabūhā. If they disbelieve they will have drawn their afflictions upon themselves fa-balāyāhum li-anfusihim ijtalabūhā. The Realتعالى is beyond being described by the adornment of anyone's consent li-wifāqi aḥadin or the deficiency of anyone's opposition li-khilāfi aḥadin. And if you disbelieve then surely to God belongs all that is in the heavens and in the earth means that they may abandon the practice of servanthood in their actions but they cannot abandon the reality of their being His ser- vants as created beings. God most high said “There is none in the heavens and the earth but he comes to the Compassionate One as a servant” [19:93].,{ يٰأَهْلَ ٱلْكِتَابِ لاَ تَغْلُواْ فِي دِينِكُمْ وَلاَ تَقُولُواْ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ إِلاَّ ٱلْحَقَّ إِنَّمَا ٱلْمَسِيحُ عِيسَى ٱبْنُ مَرْيَمَ رَسُولُ ٱللَّهِ وَكَلِمَتُهُ أَلْقَاهَا إِلَىٰ مَرْيَمَ وَرُوحٌ مِّنْهُ فَآمِنُواْ بِٱللَّهِ وَرُسُلِهِ وَلاَ تَقُولُواْ ثَلاَثَةٌ ٱنتَهُواْ خَيْراً لَّكُمْ إِنَّمَا ٱللَّهُ إِلَـٰهٌ وَاحِدٌ سُبْحَانَهُ أَن يَكُونَ لَهُ وَلَدٌ لَّهُ مَا فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَكَفَىٰ بِٱللَّهِ وَكِيلاً }
O people of the scripture do not go to extremes in your religion and do not say about God except the truth: the Messiah Jesus the son of Mary was only the Messenger of God and His word which He cast to Mary and a spirit from Him. So believe in God and His messengers and do not say “Three.” Refrain it is better for you. Verily God is but One God. Glory be to Him that He should have a son! To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and in the earth. God suffices as a Guardian. Their going to extremes in their religion [refers to] their following their own opinion since they described what they worshiped in the likeness of created beings. [This] was also contradictory since they said one is three and three is one. To persevere in what is false only increases the falseness.,{ لَّن يَسْتَنكِفَ ٱلْمَسِيحُ أَن يَكُونَ عَبْداً للَّهِ وَلاَ ٱلْمَلاۤئِكَةُ ٱلْمُقَرَّبُونَ وَمَن يَسْتَنْكِفْ عَنْ عِبَادَتِهِ وَيَسْتَكْبِرْ فَسَيَحْشُرُهُمْ إِلَيهِ جَمِيعاً } * { فَأَمَّا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ فَيُوَفِّيهِمْ أُجُورَهُمْ وَيَزيدُهُمْ مِّن فَضْلِهِ وَأَمَّا ٱلَّذِينَ ٱسْتَنكَفُواْ وَٱسْتَكْبَرُواْ فَيُعَذِّبُهُمْ عَذَاباً أَلِيماً وَلاَ يَجِدُونَ لَهُمْ مِّن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ وَلِيّاً وَلاَ نَصِيراً }
The Messiah would never disdain to be a servant of God neither would the angels who are nigh. Whoever disdains to worship Him and waxes proud He will assuredly muster them to Him all of them. As for those who believed who did righteous deeds He will pay them their wages in full and He will give them more of His bounty; How can they disdain the worship of Him when one's honor and dignity sharaf [comes] through worshipḍ How can they be too proud to humble themselves when one's ruin talaf [comes] from being too proudḍ Because of this matter the first words the Messiah spoke were Lo! I am God's servant [19:30]. Servants become beautiful in their humility toward [their] masters. This is something well known and without doubt. [The phrase] neither would the angels who are nigh does not imply that [the angels] are superior to the Messiah. Rather [God] was addressing them in accordance with their beliefs-they believed in the superiority of the angels over human beings.and as for those who disdain and are too proud He will chastise them with a painful chastisement and they shall not find for themselves besides God any friend or helper. The painful chastisement is that they will never attain to the communion [of lovers] after they have come to know His majesty. When what they know becomes indisputable they will know that they have been left behind. Their sorrow on that day for what has slipped away from them will be their most intense punishment.,{ لَّن يَسْتَنكِفَ ٱلْمَسِيحُ أَن يَكُونَ عَبْداً للَّهِ وَلاَ ٱلْمَلاۤئِكَةُ ٱلْمُقَرَّبُونَ وَمَن يَسْتَنْكِفْ عَنْ عِبَادَتِهِ وَيَسْتَكْبِرْ فَسَيَحْشُرُهُمْ إِلَيهِ جَمِيعاً } * { فَأَمَّا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ فَيُوَفِّيهِمْ أُجُورَهُمْ وَيَزيدُهُمْ مِّن فَضْلِهِ وَأَمَّا ٱلَّذِينَ ٱسْتَنكَفُواْ وَٱسْتَكْبَرُواْ فَيُعَذِّبُهُمْ عَذَاباً أَلِيماً وَلاَ يَجِدُونَ لَهُمْ مِّن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ وَلِيّاً وَلاَ نَصِيراً }

O people a proof has now come to you from your Lord The proof burhān is that which appeared in their innermost selves from the testimonial witnessings shawāhid of the Real. and We have revealed to you a manifest light. It is His speech khiṬāb-they obtain insight istibṣār through the ponder- ing of its meanings.,{ فَأَمَّا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱعْتَصَمُواْ بِهِ فَسَيُدْخِلُهُمْ فِي رَحْمَةٍ مِّنْهُ وَفَضْلٍ وَيَهْدِيهِمْ إِلَيْهِ صِرَاطاً مُّسْتَقِيماً }
As for those who believe in God and hold fast to Him He will surely admit them to mercy from Him and bounty and He will guide them to Him by a straight path. He will surely admit them sayudkhiluhum to mercy from Him: the par- ticle indicating the future the letter sīn indicates that He will preserve their faith for them at the time of their deaths just as He has honored them with deeper knowledge and faith in the here and now. and He will guide them to Him by a straight path. This guidance is His honoring them [as they] came to know that this guidance is a bounty from God for them not because they deserve it and not because of their seeking effort toil or pains.,{ يَسْتَفْتُونَكَ قُلِ ٱللَّهُ يُفْتِيكُمْ فِي ٱلْكَلاَلَةِ إِن ٱمْرُؤٌ هَلَكَ لَيْسَ لَهُ وَلَدٌ وَلَهُ أُخْتٌ فَلَهَا نِصْفُ مَا تَرَكَ وَهُوَ يَرِثُهَآ إِن لَّمْ يَكُنْ لَّهَآ وَلَدٌ فَإِن كَانَتَا ٱثْنَتَيْنِ فَلَهُمَا ٱلثُّلُثَانِ مِمَّا تَرَكَ وَإِن كَانُوۤاْ إِخْوَةً رِّجَالاً وَنِسَآءً فَلِلذَّكَرِ مِثْلُ حَظِّ ٱلأُنثَيَيْنِ يُبَيِّنُ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمْ أَن تَضِلُّواْ وَٱللَّهُ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عَلِيمٌ }
They will ask you for a pronouncement. Say: “God pronounces to you concerning indirect heirs. If a man perishes having no children but he has a sister hers is half of what he leaves and he is her heir if she has no children. If there be two sisters theirs are two-thirds of what he leaves; if there be siblings men and women then the male shall receive the equivalent of the portion of two females. God makes clear to you lest you go astray; and God has knowledge of all things.” He cut short their disputes regarding the apportioning of inheritance by proclaiming the formula determined for them for truly wealth is an object of desire for humankind and the lower selves nufūs are prone to greed. If the appropriate amounts were not decisively determined doubts would arise from the use of independent judgment ijtihād and this would lead to contention and mutual attacks. This summation [of the portions of inheritance] definitively establishes the inheritance amounts for the dispu- tants. His designation of inheritance rights for women-even when their closest relatives do not defend them-shows consideration for their weaker position. [On the other hand] the preference given to males over them is because of the burdens [they have been given] in providing and seeking income and in supporting [women].,
