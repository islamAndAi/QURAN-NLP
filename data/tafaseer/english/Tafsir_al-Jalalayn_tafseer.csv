Arabic,Tafseer
بِسمِ ٱلله الرَّحْمٰنِ الرَّحِيـمِ,In the Name of God the Compassionate the Merciful
ٱلْحَمْدُ للَّهِ رَبِّ ٱلْعَالَمِينَ,In the Name of God the name of a thing is that by which it can be known. The Names of God exalted be He are the archetypal forms ṣuwar nawʿiyya whose specificities and ipseities hūwiyya indicate the attributes of God and His essence and which indicate by their very existence His countenance and by their individuation His oneness. For these are the outward manifestations through which He can be known; Allāh is a name for the divine essence qua essence absolutely without taking into consideration that it may be qualified by the attributes or indeed taking into consideration that it may not be so qualified; the Compassionate is the one who causes existence and perfection to flow upon all things in the measure that divine wisdom requires and to the capacity of the receiving entities qawābil from the outset of their creation; the Merciful al-Raḥīm is the one who bestows the spiritual perfection kamāl maʿnawī that has been earmarked for the human species in the end sc. in the Hereafter. It is for this reason that they say O You Who are the Compassionate One of this world and of the Hereafter yā raḥmān al-dunyā wa'l-ākhira but say O Merciful One of the Hereafter raḥīm al-ākhira the meaning then is in the perfect human all-encompassing form general and specific mercy which is the locus of manifestation of the divine essence and the greatest truth with the totality of attributes I commence and I recite. It Allāh is the Greatest Name of God. It is to this meaning that the Prophet's ṣlʿm alluded when he said 'I have been given the sum of all excellent speech sc. The QurÌān and have been sent to complete the noble character traits makārim al-akhlāq. For words constitute the realities ḥaqāÌiq of existents mawjūdāt and their concrete substances aʿyān just as Jesus peace be upon him was called a Word from God cf. 33945. The noble character traits are the perfections of these existents and represent their specifities constituting the sources of their the existents' actions in their entirety contained as they are in the comprehensive human microcosm kawn insānī. Herein lies a subtlety la?īfa namely that the prophets peace be upon them have made the letters of the alphabet analogous to the ranks of existents marātib al-mawjūdāt.
ٱلرَّحْمـٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ,The Compassionate the Merciful that is to say the One who possesses ‘mercy’ which means to want what is good for those who deserve it.
مَـٰلِكِ يَوْمِ ٱلدِّينِ,Master of the Day of Judgement that is the day of requite the Day of Resurrection. The reason for the specific mention of the Day of Judgement is that the mastery of none shall appear on that Day except that of God may He be exalted as is indicated by God’s words ‘Whose is the Kingdom today?’ ‘God’s’ Q. 4016 if one reads it mālik as opposed to malik then this signifies that He has possession of the entire affair on the Day of Resurrection or else that He is ever described by this expression in the same way as He is described as ‘Forgiver of sin’ ghāfir al-dhanb. Thus one can validly take it as an adjective of a definite noun.
إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ,You alone we worship and You alone we ask for help that is to say we reserve worship for You alone by way of acknowledging Your Oneness tawhīd and so on and we ask for Your assistance in worship and in other things.
ٱهْدِنَا ٱلصِّرَاطَ ٱلْمُسْتَقِيمَ,Guide us to the straight path that is ‘show us the way to it’. This is substituted by
صِرَاطَ ٱلَّذِينَ أَنْعَمْتَ عَلَيْهِمْ غَيْرِ ٱلْمَغْضُوبِ عَلَيْهِم وَلاَ ٱلضَّآلِّينَ,the path of those whom You have favoured with guidance from alladhīna together with its relative clause is substituted by ghayri l-maghdūbi ‘alayhim not the path of those against whom there is wrath namely the Jews and nor of those who are astray namely the Christians. The subtle meaning implied by this substitution is that the guided ones are neither the Jews nor the Christians. But God knows best what is right and to Him is the Return and the final Resort. May God bless our master Muhammad (s) his Family and Companions and grant them everlasting peace. Sufficient is God for us; an excellent Guardian is He. There is no power and no strength save in God the High the Tremendous.
الۤـمۤ,Alif lām mīm God knows best what He means by these letters.
ذَلِكَ ٱلْكِتَابُ لاَ رَيْبَ فِيهِ هُدًى لِّلْمُتَّقِينَ,That meaning this Book which Muhammad (s) recites in it there is no doubt no uncertainty that it is from God the negation lĀ rayba fĪhi is the predicate of dhĀlika; the use of the demonstrative here is intended to glorify the Book. A guidance hudĀ is a second predicate meaning that it the Book ‘guides’ for the God-fearing namely those that tend towards piety by adhering to commands and avoiding things prohibited thereby guarding themselves from the Fire;
ٱلَّذِينَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱلْغَيْبِ وَيُقِيمُونَ ٱلصَّلٰوةَ وَممَّا رَزَقْنَاهُمْ يُنْفِقُونَ,who believe in that is who accept the truth of the Unseen what is hidden from them of the Resurrection Paradise and the Fire; and maintain the prayer that is to say who perform it giving it its proper due; and of what We have provided them that is of what we have bestowed upon them expend in obedience to God;
وٱلَّذِينَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِمَآ أُنْزِلَ إِلَيْكَ وَمَآ أُنْزِلَ مِن قَبْلِكَ وَبِٱلآخِرَةِ هُمْ يُوقِنُونَ,and who believe in what has been revealed to you namely the Qur’ān; and what was revealed before you that is the Torah the Gospel and other scriptures; and of the Hereafter they are certain that is they know it is real.
أُوْلَـٰئِكَ عَلَىٰ هُدًى مِّن رَّبِّهِمْ وَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْمُفْلِحُونَ,Those as described in the way mentioned are upon guidance from their Lord those are the ones that will prosper that is who will succeed in entering Paradise and be saved from the Fire.
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ سَوَآءٌ عَلَيْهِمْ ءَأَنذَرْتَهُمْ أَمْ لَمْ تُنْذِرْهُمْ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ,As for the disbelievers the likes of Abū Jahl Abū Lahab and such; alike it is for them whether you have warned them or have not warned them they do not believe as God knows very well so do not hope that they will believe read a-andhartahum pronouncing both hamzas or by not pronouncing the second making it an alif instead and inserting an alif between the one not pronounced and the other one or leaving this insertion; al-indhār ‘warning’ is to give knowledge of something and simultaneously instil an element of fear.
خَتَمَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ قُلُوبِهمْ وَعَلَىٰ سَمْعِهِمْ وَعَلَىٰ أَبْصَٰرِهِمْ غِشَاوَةٌ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ عظِيمٌ,God has set a seal on their hearts impressing on them and making certain that no good enters them; and on their hearing in which He has deposited something so that they cannot profit from the truth they hear; and on their eyes is a covering that is a veil so that they do not see the truth; and for them there will be a mighty chastisement that is intense and everlasting.
وَمِنَ ٱلنَّاسِ مَن يَقُولُ آمَنَّا بِٱللَّهِ وَبِٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلآخِرِ وَمَا هُم بِمُؤْمِنِينَ,The following was revealed concerning the hypocrites and some people there are who say ‘We believe in God and the Last Day’ that is in the Day of Resurrection because it is the very last day; but they are not believers the plural import of man in man yaqūl ‘who says’ is taken into account here as expressed by a pronoun hum that expresses this plural meaning.
يُخَادِعُونَ ٱللَّهَ وَٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَمَا يَخْدَعُونَ إِلاَّ أَنْفُسَهُم وَمَا يَشْعُرُونَ,They would deceive God and the believers by manifesting the opposite of the unbelief they hide so that they can avoid His rulings in this world; and only themselves they deceive yukhādi‘ūn for the evil consequences of their deception will rebound upon them as they are disgraced in this world when God makes known to His Prophet what they are hiding and they will be punished in the Hereafter; and they are not aware and they do not know that they are actually deceiving themselves mukhāda‘a although a third verbal form from khāda‘a actually denotes a one-way action such as when one says ‘āqabtu al-lissa ‘I punished the thief’ using the third verbal form ‘āqaba; the mention of ‘God’ in this statement is for rhetorical effect; a variant reading for wa-mā yukhādi‘ūna has wa-mā yakhda‘ūna.
فِي قُلُوبِهِم مَّرَضٌ فَزَادَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ مَرَضاً وَلَهُم عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ بِمَا كَانُوا يَكْذِبُونَ,In their hearts is a sickness doubt and hypocrisy which ails their hearts debilitating them; and God has increased their sickness with what He has revealed in the Qur’ān since they disbelieve it; and there awaits them a painful chastisement because they used to lie read yukadhdhibūn to imply that they used to call the Prophet of God a liar or yakdhibūn to imply their mendacity when saying ‘we believe’.
وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمْ لاَ تُفْسِدُواْ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ قَالُوۤاْ إِنَّمَا نَحْنُ مُصْلِحُونَ,When it is said to them that is these latter ‘Do not spread corruption in the land’ through unbelief and hindering people from faith They say ‘We are only putting things right’ that is ‘we are not engaging in corruption’. God exalted be He refutes them saying
أَلاۤ إِنَّهُمْ هُمُ ٱلْمُفْسِدُونَ وَلَـٰكِن لاَّ يَشْعُرُونَ,Truly a-lā ‘truly’ is for alerting intended emphatically they are the agents of corruption but they perceive this not.
وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمْ آمِنُواْ كَمَآ آمَنَ ٱلنَّاسُ قَالُوۤاْ أَنُؤْمِنُ كَمَآ آمَنَ ٱلسُّفَهَآءُ أَلاۤ إِنَّهُمْ هُمُ ٱلسُّفَهَآءُ وَلَـٰكِن لاَّ يَعْلَمُونَ,When it is said to them ‘Believe as the people believe’ that is as the Companions of the Prophet s They say ‘Shall we believe as fools believe?’ that is as the ignorant do? No we do not follow their way. The exalted One refutes them saying Truly they are the foolish ones but they know this not.
وَإِذَا لَقُواْ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ قَالُوۤا آمَنَّا وَإِذَا خَلَوْاْ إِلَىٰ شَيَاطِينِهِمْ قَالُوۤاْ إِنَّا مَعَكُمْ إِنَّمَا نَحْنُ مُسْتَهْزِءُونَ,When they meet laqū is actually laquyū but the damma has been omitted being too cumbersome for pronunciation; likewise the yā’ is omitted because it is unvocalised and is followed by a wāw; those who believe they say ‘We believe’; but when they go apart away from them and return to their devils their leaders they say ‘We are with you in religion; we were only mocking them the believers by feigning belief.
ٱللَّهُ يَسْتَهْزِئُ بِهِمْ وَيَمُدُّهُمْ فِي طُغْيَانِهِمْ يَعْمَهُونَ,God Himself mocks them requiting them for their mockery leaving them that is giving them respite in their insolence that is in their transgressing the limits of unbelief; bewildered wavering in perplexity ya‘mahūn is a circumstantial qualifier.
أُوْلَـٰئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱشْتَرَوُاْ ٱلضَّلَـٰلَةَ بِٱلْهُدَىٰ فَمَا رَبِحَتْ تِّجَارَتُهُمْ وَمَا كَانُواْ مُهْتَدِينَ,Those are they who have bought error for guidance that is they have exchanged the latter for the former; so their commerce has not profited them that is to say they have gained nothing from it indeed they have lost because their destination is the Fire made everlasting for them; nor are they guided in what they did.
مَثَلُهُمْ كَمَثَلِ ٱلَّذِي ٱسْتَوْقَدَ نَاراً فَلَمَّآ أَضَآءَتْ مَا حَوْلَهُ ذَهَبَ ٱللَّهُ بِنُورِهِمْ وَتَرَكَهُمْ فِي ظُلُمَٰتٍ لاَّ يُبْصِرُونَ,Their likeness the way they are in their hypocrisy is as the likeness of one who kindled that is one who lit a fire in darkness and when it illumined all about him so that he is able to see and to feel warm and secure from those he feared God took away their light extinguishing it the plural pronoun in nūrihim takes into account the plural import of alladhī; and left them in darkness unable to see what is around them confused as to the way in fear; likewise are those who have found temporary security by professing faith but who will meet with terror and punishment upon death; these last are
صُمٌّ بُكْمٌ عُمْيٌ فَهُمْ لاَ يَرْجِعُونَ,deaf to the truth so that they cannot hear it and accept it; dumb mute as regards goodness unable to speak of it; and blind to the path of guidance so that they cannot perceive it; they shall not return from error.
أَوْ كَصَيِّبٍ مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ فِيهِ ظُلُمَٰتٌ وَرَعْدٌ وَبَرْقٌ يَجْعَلُونَ أَصَٰبِعَهُمْ فِيۤ آذَانِهِم مِّنَ ٱلصَّوَٰعِقِ حَذَرَ ٱلْمَوْتِ وٱللَّهُ مُحِيطٌ بِٱلْكَٰفِرِينَ,Or the likeness of them is as a cloudburst that is the likeness of them is as people are during rain ka-sayyib the term is originally sayyūb from the verb sāba yasūbu meaning ‘it came down’; out of the heaven out of the clouds in which clouds is darkness layer upon layer and thunder the angel in charge of them sc. the clouds; it is also said that this thunder is actually the sound of his voice; and lightning the flash caused by his voice which he uses to drive them — they the people under the rain put their fingers that is their fingertips in their ears against because of the thunderclaps the violent sound of thunder in order not to hear it cautious of fearful of death if they were to hear it. Similar is the case with these when the Qur’ān is revealed in which there is mention of the unbelief that is like darkness the threat of punishment that is like the sound of thunder and the clear arguments that are like the clear lightning they shut their ears in order not to hear it and thereby incline towards true faith and abandon their religion which for them would be death; and God encompasses the disbelievers in both knowledge and power so they cannot escape Him.
يَكَادُ ٱلْبَرْقُ يَخْطَفُ أَبْصَٰرَهُمْ كُلَّمَا أَضَآءَ لَهُمْ مَّشَوْاْ فِيهِ وَإِذَآ أَظْلَمَ عَلَيْهِمْ قَامُواْ وَلَوْ شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ لَذَهَبَ بِسَمْعِهِمْ وَأَبْصَٰرِهِمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,The lightning well-nigh almost snatches away their sight that is takes it away swiftly; whensoever it gives them light they walk in it in its light; and when the darkness is over them they stop that is they stand still a simile of the perturbation that the Qur’ānic arguments cause in their hearts and of their acknowledging the truths of what they love to hear and recoiling from what they detest; had God willed He would have taken away their hearing and their sight that is the exterior faculty in the same way that He took away their inner one; Truly God has power over all things that He wills as for example His taking away of the above-mentioned.
يَٰـأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّاسُ ٱعْبُدُواْ رَبَّكُمُ ٱلَّذِي خَلَقَكُمْ وَٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ,O people of Mecca worship profess the oneness of your Lord Who created you made you when you were nothing and created those that were before you; so that you may be fearful of His punishment by worshipping Him la‘alla ‘so that’ is essentially an optative but when spoken by God it denotes an affirmative
ٱلَّذِي جَعَلَ لَكُمُ ٱلأَرْضَ فِرَٰشاً وَٱلسَّمَاءَ بِنَآءً وَأَنزَلَ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مَآءً فَأَخْرَجَ بِهِ مِنَ ٱلثَّمَرَٰتِ رِزْقاً لَّكُمْ فَلاَ تَجْعَلُواْ للَّهِ أَندَاداً وَأَنْتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ,He Who assigned to you created for you the earth for a couch like a carpet that is laid out neither extremely hard nor extremely soft so as to make it impossible to stand firm upon it; and heaven for an edifice like a roof; and sent down from the heaven water wherewith He brought forth all types of fruits for your provision; so set not up compeers to God that is partners in worship while you know that He is the Creator that you create not and that only One that creates can be God.
وَإِن كُنْتُمْ فِي رَيْبٍ مِّمَّا نَزَّلْنَا عَلَىٰ عَبْدِنَا فَأْتُواْ بِسُورَةٍ مِّن مِّثْلِهِ وَٱدْعُواْ شُهَدَآءَكُم مِّن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ صَٰدِقِينَ,And if you are in doubt in uncertainty concerning what We have revealed to Our servant Muhammad (s) of the Qur’ān that it is from God then bring a sūra like it that is also revealed min mithlihi min is explicative that is a sūra like it in its eloquence fine arrangement and its bestowal of knowledge of the Unseen; a sūra is a passage with a beginning and end made up of a minimum of three verses; and call your witnesses those other gods that you worship besides God that is other than Him so that it can be seen if you are truthful in your claim that Muhammad (s) speaks it from himself. So do this for you are also fluent speakers of Arabic like him. When they could not do this God said
فَإِن لَّمْ تَفْعَلُواْ وَلَن تَفْعَلُواْ فَٱتَّقُواْ ٱلنَّارَ ٱلَّتِي وَقُودُهَا ٱلنَّاسُ وَٱلْحِجَارَةُ أُعِدَّتْ لِلْكَٰفِرِينَ,And if you do not do what was mentioned because you are incapable and you will not a parenthetical statement that is never will you be able to because of its inimitability then fear through belief in God and belief that this is not the words of a human the Fire whose fuel is men disbelievers and stones like their very idols indicating that its heat is extreme since it burns with the stones mentioned unlike the fires of this world that burn with wood and similar materials; prepared and made ready for disbelievers so that they are punished in it this phrase u‘iddat li’l-kāfirīna ‘prepared for disbelievers’ is either a new sentence or a sustained circumstantial qualifier.
وَبَشِّرِ ٱلَّذِين آمَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّـٰلِحَٰتِ أَنَّ لَهُمْ جَنَّٰتٍ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلأَنْهَٰرُ كُلَّمَا رُزِقُواْ مِنْهَا مِن ثَمَرَةٍ رِّزْقاً قَالُواْ هَـٰذَا ٱلَّذِي رُزِقْنَا مِن قَبْلُ وَأُتُواْ بِهِ مُتَشَٰبِهاً وَلَهُمْ فِيهَآ أَزْوَٰجٌ مُّطَهَّرَةٌ وَهُمْ فِيهَا خَٰلِدُونَ,And give good tidings to inform those who believe who have faith in God and perform righteous deeds such as the obligatory and supererogatory rituals that theirs shall be Gardens of trees and habitations underneath which that is underneath these trees and palaces rivers run tajrī min tahtihā’l-anhāru that is there are waters in it al-nahr is the place in which water flows and is so called because the water carves yanhar its way through it; the reference to it as ‘running’ is figurative; whensoever they are provided with fruits therefrom that is whenever they are given to eat from these gardens they shall say ‘This is what that is the like of what we were provided with before’ that is before this in Paradise since its fruits are similar and this is evidenced by the following statement they shall be given it the provision in perfect semblance that is resembling one another in colour but different in taste; and there for them shall be spouses of houris and others purified from menstruation and impurities; therein they shall abide dwelling therein forever neither perishing nor departing therefrom. And when the Jews said ‘Why does God strike a similitude about flies where He says And if a fly should rob them of anything Q. 2273 and about a spider where He says As the likeness of the spider Q. 2941 what does God want with these vile creatures? God then revealed the following
إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لاَ يَسْتَحْى أَن يَضْرِبَ مَثَلاً مَّا بَعُوضَةً فَمَا فَوْقَهَا فَأَمَّا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ فَيَعْلَمُونَ أَنَّهُ ٱلْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّهِمْ وَأَمَّا ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ فَيَقُولُونَ مَاذَآ أَرَادَ ٱللَّهُ بِهَـٰذَا مَثَلاً يُضِلُّ بِهِ كَثِيراً وَيَهْدِي بِهِ كَثِيراً وَمَا يُضِلُّ بِهِ إِلاَّ ٱلْفَٰسِقِينَ,God is not ashamed to strike to make a similitude mathal is the first direct object; mā either represents an indefinite noun described by what comes after it and constitutes a second direct object meaning ‘whatever that similitude may be’; or it the mā is extra to emphasise the vileness involved so that what follows constitutes the second direct object; even of a gnat ba‘ūda is the singular of ba‘ūd that is small flies; or anything above it that is larger than it so that this explanation is not affected by the size of the creature with regard to the judgement God is making; as for the believers they know it the similitude is the truth established and given in this instance from their Lord; but as for disbelievers they say ‘What did God desire by this for a similitude?’ mathalan is a specification meaning ‘by this similitude’; mā is an interrogative of rejection and is the subject; dhā means alladhī whose relative clause contains its predicate in other words ‘what use is there in it?’. God then responds to them saying Thereby that is by this similitude He leads many astray from the truth on account of their disbelieving in it and thereby He guides many believers on account of their belief in it; and thereby He leads none astray except the wicked those that reject obedience to Him.
ٱلَّذِينَ يَنقُضُونَ عَهْدَ ٱللَّهِ مِن بَعْدِ مِيثَٰقِهِ وَيَقْطَعُونَ مَآ أَمَرَ ٱللَّهُ بِهِ أَن يُوصَلَ وَيُفْسِدُونَ فِي ٱلأرْضِ أُولَـۤئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْخَٰسِرُونَ,Those such as He has described break the covenant of God the contract He made with them in the revealed Books to belief in Muhammad (s) after its solemn binding after it has been confirmed with them and such as cut what God has commanded should be joined of belief in the Prophet of kinship and other matters an in the phrase an yūsala ‘that it be joined’ substitutes for the pronoun suffixed in bihi of the preceding words mā amara Llāhu bihi ‘that which God has commanded’; and such as do corruption in the land by way of their transgressing and impeding faith they the ones thus described shall be the losers since they shall end up in the Fire made everlasting for them.
كَيْفَ تَكْفُرُونَ بِٱللَّهِ وَكُنْتُمْ أَمْوَٰتاً فَأَحْيَٰكُمْ ثُمَّ يُمِيتُكُمْ ثُمَّ يُحْيِيكُمْ ثُمَّ إِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ,How do you people of Mecca disbelieve in God when you were dead semen inside loins and He gave you life in the womb and in this world by breathing Spirit into you the interrogative here is either intended to provoke amazement at their persistent unbelief despite the evidence established or intended as a rebuke; then He shall make you dead after your terms of life are completed then He shall give you life at the Resurrection then to Him you shall be returned! after resurrection whereupon He shall requite you according to your deeds; and He states as proof of the Resurrection when they denied it
هُوَ ٱلَّذِي خَلَقَ لَكُمْ مَّا فِي ٱلأَرْضِ جَمِيعاً ثُمَّ ٱسْتَوَىٰ إِلَى ٱلسَّمَآءِ فَسَوَّٰهُنَّ سَبْعَ سَمَٰوَٰتٍ وَهُوَ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عَلِيمٌ,He it is Who created for you all that is in the earth that is the earth and all that is in it so that you may benefit from and learn lessons from it; then after creating the earth He turned to that is He made His object heaven and levelled them fa-sawwāhunna the pronoun -hunna refers to ‘heaven’ since it heaven is implicit in the import of the sentence attributed to it the pronoun that is to say He made them thus as He says in another verse fa-qadāhunna so He determined them Q. 4112 seven heavens and He has knowledge of all things in their totality and in their individual detail so do you not then think that the One who has the power to create this to begin with which is much greater than what you are also has the power to bring you back after death?
وَإِذْ قَالَ رَبُّكَ لِلْمَلَٰئِكَةِ إِنِّي جَاعِلٌ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ خَلِيفَةً قَالُواْ أَتَجْعَلُ فِيهَا مَن يُفْسِدُ فِيهَا وَيَسْفِكُ ٱلدِّمَآءَ وَنَحْنُ نُسَبِّحُ بِحَمْدِكَ وَنُقَدِّسُ لَكَ قَالَ إِنِّيۤ أَعْلَمُ مَا لاَ تَعْلَمُونَ,And mention O Muhammad (s) when your Lord said to the angels ‘I am appointing on earth a vicegerent’ who shall act as My deputy by implementing My rulings therein — and this vicegerent was Adam; They said ‘What will You appoint therein one who will do corruption therein through disobedience and shed blood spilling it through killing just as the progeny of the jinn did for they used to inhabit it but when they became corrupted God sent down the angels against them and they were driven away to islands and into the mountains; while we glorify continuously You with praise that is “We say Glory and Praise be to You” and sanctify You?’ that is ‘We exalt You as transcendent above what does not befit You?; the lām of laka ‘You’ is extra and the sentence wa-nuqaddisu laka ‘We sanctify You’ is a circumstantial qualifier the import being ‘thus we are more entitled to be Your vicegerents’; He exalted be He said ‘Assuredly I know what you know not’ of the benefits of making Adam a vicegerent and of the fact that among his progeny will be the obedient and the transgressor and justice will prevail between them. They said ‘God will never create anything more noble in His eyes than us nor more knowledgeable since we have been created before it and have seen what it has not seen. God then created Adam from the surface of the earth adīm al-ard adīm literally means ‘skin’ taking a handful of all its colours and mixing it with different waters then made him upright and breathed into him the Spirit and he thus became a living being with senses after having been inanimate.
وَعَلَّمَ ءَادَمَ ٱلأَسْمَآءَ كُلَّهَا ثُمَّ عَرَضَهُمْ عَلَى ٱلْمَلَٰئِكَةِ فَقَالَ أَنْبِئُونِي بِأَسْمَآءِ هَـٰؤُلاۤءِ إِن كُنْتُمْ صَٰدِقِينَ,And He taught Adam the names that is the names of things named all of them by placing knowledge of them into his heart; then He presented them these names the majority of which concerned intellectual beings to the angels and said to them in reproach ‘Now tell Me inform Me the names of these things named if you speak truly’ in your claim that I would not create anything more knowledgeable than you or that you are more deserving of this vicegerency; the response to the conditional sentence is intimated by what precedes it.
قَالُواْ سُبْحَٰنَكَ لاَ عِلْمَ لَنَآ إِلاَّ مَا عَلَّمْتَنَآ إِنَّكَ أَنْتَ ٱلْعَلِيمُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ,They said ‘Glory be to You! exalting You above that any should object to You We know not except what You have taught us. Surely You are innaka anta emphasises the preceding suffixed pronoun kāf the Knower Wise’ from whose knowledge and wisdom nothing escapes.
قَالَ يَآءَادَمُ أَنبِئْهُمْ بِأَسْمَآئِهِمْ فَلَمَّآ أَنْبَأَهُمْ بِأَسْمَآئِهِمْ قَالَ أَلَمْ أَقُلْ لَّكُمْ إِنِيۤ أَعْلَمُ غَيْبَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَأَعْلَمُ مَا تُبْدُونَ وَمَا كُنْتُمْ تَكْتُمُونَ,He exalted be He said ‘Adam tell them the angels their names’ all of the things named; so he named each thing by its appellation and mentioned the wisdom behind its creation; And when he had told them their names He exalted said in rebuke ‘Did I not tell you that I know the Unseen in the heavens and the earth? what is unseen in them And I know what you reveal what you manifested when you said ‘What will You appoint therein …’ and what you were hiding what you were keeping secret when you were saying that God would not create anything more knowledgeable or more noble in His eyes than us.
وَإِذْ قُلْنَا لِلْمَلَٰئِكَةِ ٱسْجُدُواْ لأَدَمَ فَسَجَدُواْ إِلاَّ إِبْلِيسَ أَبَىٰ وَٱسْتَكْبَرَ وَكَانَ مِنَ ٱلْكَٰفِرِينَ,And mention when We said to the angels ‘Prostrate yourselves to Adam’ a prostration that is a bow of salutation; so they prostrated themselves except Iblīs the father of the jinn who was among the angels he refused to prostrate and disdained became proud and said I am better than he Q. 712; and so he became one of the disbelievers according to God’s knowledge.
وَقُلْنَا يَآءَادَمُ ٱسْكُنْ أَنْتَ وَزَوْجُكَ ٱلْجَنَّةَ وَكُلاَ مِنْهَا رَغَداً حَيْثُ شِئْتُمَا وَلاَ تَقْرَبَا هَـٰذِهِ ٱلشَّجَرَةَ فَتَكُونَا مِنَ ٱلْظَّٰلِمِينَ,And We said ‘Adam dwell anta ‘you’ of ‘dwell you’ here reiterates the concealed pronoun of the person of the verb uskun so that it wa-zawjuk may be made a supplement to it; and your wife Eve Hawwā’ — who was created from his left rib — in the Garden and eat thereof of its food easefully of anything without restrictions where you desire; but do not come near this tree to eat from it and this was wheat or a vine or something else lest you be become evildoers’ that is transgressors.
فَأَزَلَّهُمَا ٱلشَّيْطَٰنُ عَنْهَا فَأَخْرَجَهُمَا مِمَّا كَانَا فِيهِ وَقُلْنَا ٱهْبِطُواْ بَعْضُكُمْ لِبَعْضٍ عَدُوٌّ وَلَكُمْ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ مُسْتَقَرٌّ وَمَتَٰعٌ إِلَىٰ حِينٍ,Then Satan Iblīs caused them to slip he caused them to be removed fa-azallahumā a variant reading has fa-azālahumā he caused them to be away from it therefrom that is from the Garden when he said to them ‘Shall I point you to the tree of eternity’ cf. Q. 20120 and swore to them by God that he was only giving good advice to them and so they ate of it; and brought them out of what they were in of bliss; and We said ‘Go down to earth both of you and all those comprised by your seed; some of you of your progeny an enemy to the other through your wronging one another; and in the earth a dwelling a place of settlement shall be yours and enjoyment of whatever of its vegetation you may enjoy for a while’ until the time your terms of life are concluded.
فَتَلَقَّىٰ ءَادَمُ مِن رَّبِّهِ كَلِمَٰتٍ فَتَابَ عَلَيْهِ إِنَّهُ هُوَ ٱلتَّوَّابُ ٱلرَّحِيمُ,Thereafter Adam received certain words from his Lord with which He inspired him a variant reading of Ādamu has accusative Ādama and nominative kalimātu meaning they the words came to him and these were those of the verse Lord we have wronged ourselves Q. 723 with which he supplicated and He relented to him that is He accepted his repentance; truly He is the Relenting to His servants the Merciful to them.
قُلْنَا ٱهْبِطُواْ مِنْهَا جَمِيعاً فَإِمَّا يَأْتِيَنَّكُم مِّنِّي هُدًى فَمَن تَبِعَ هُدَايَ فَلاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلاَ هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ,We said ‘Go down from it from the Garden all together He has repeated this phrase qulnā ihbitū in order to supplement it with yet fa-immā the nūn of the conditional particle in ‘if’ has been assimilated with the extra mā there shall come to you from Me guidance a Book and a prophet and whoever follows My guidance believing in me and performing deeds in obedience of Me no fear shall befall them neither shall they grieve in the Hereafter since they will be admitted into Paradise.
وَٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرواْ وَكَذَّبُواْ بِآيَٰتِنَآ أُولَـٰئِكَ أَصْحَٰبُ ٱلنَّارِ هُمْ فِيهَا خَٰلِدُونَ,As for the disbelievers who deny Our signs Our Books those shall be the inhabitants of the Fire abiding therein’ enduring perpetually neither perishing nor exiting therefrom.
يَٰبَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ ٱذْكُرُواْ نِعْمَتِيَ ٱلَّتِي أَنْعَمْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ وَأَوْفُواْ بِعَهْدِيۤ أُوفِ بِعَهْدِكُمْ وَإِيَّٰيَ فَٱرْهَبُونِ,O Children of Israel sons of Jacob remember My favour wherewith I favoured you that is your forefathers saving them from Pharaoh parting the sea sending clouds as shelter and other instances for which you should show gratitude by being obedient to Me; and fulfil My covenant that which I took from you that you believe in Muhammad (s) and I shall fulfil your covenant that which I gave to you that you shall be rewarded for this with Paradise; and be in awe of Me fear Me and not anyone else when you have abandoned belief in him the Prophet.
وَآمِنُواْ بِمَآ أَنزَلْتُ مُصَدِّقاً لِّمَا مَعَكُمْ وَلاَ تَكُونُوۤاْ أَوَّلَ كَافِرٍ بِهِ وَلاَ تَشْتَرُواْ بِآيَٰتِي ثَمَناً قَلِيلاً وَإِيَّٰيَ فَٱتَّقُونِ,And believe in what I have revealed of the Qur’ān confirming that which is with you of the Torah by its agreement with it in respect to affirmation of God’s Oneness and prophethood; and be not the first to disbelieve in it from among the People of the Scripture for those who will come after you will depend on you and so you will bear their sins. And do not sell exchange My signs those that relate to the description of Muhammad (s) in your Book; for a small price for a trivial and temporary affair of this world; that is to say do not suppress this for fear of losing what you hope to earn from lowly individuals among you; and fear Me and none other in this matter.
وَلاَ تَلْبِسُواْ ٱلْحَقَّ بِٱلْبَٰطِلِ وَتَكْتُمُواْ ٱلْحَقَّ وَأَنْتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ,And do not obscure confuse the truth that I have revealed to you with falsehood that you fabricate; and do not conceal the truth the description of Muhammad (s) wittingly that is knowing it to be the truth.
وَأَقِيمُواْ ٱلصَّلٰوةَ وَآتُواْ ٱلزَّكَٰوةَ وَٱرْكَعُواْ مَعَ ٱلرَّٰكِعِينَ,And establish prayer and pay the alms and bow with those that bow that is pray with those who pray Muhammad (s) and his Companions this was revealed concerning their religious scholars who used to say to their kin from among the Muslims ‘Stay firm upon the religion of Muhammad (s) for it is the truth’.
أَتَأْمُرُونَ ٱلنَّاسَ بِٱلْبِرِّ وَتَنْسَوْنَ أَنْفُسَكُمْ وَأَنْتُمْ تَتْلُونَ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ أَفَلاَ تَعْقِلُونَ,Will you bid others to piety to belief in Muhammad (s) and forget yourselves neglecting yourselves and not bidding them to the same while you recite the Book? in which there is the threat of chastisement if what you do contradicts what you say. Do you not understand? the evil nature of your actions that you might then repent? the sentence about ‘forgetting’ constitutes the syntactical locus of the interrogative of disavowal.
وَٱسْتَعِينُواْ بِٱلصَّبْرِ وَٱلصَّلَٰوةِ وَإِنَّهَا لَكَبِيرَةٌ إِلاَّ عَلَى ٱلْخَٰشِعِينَ,Seek help ask for assistance in your affairs in patience by restraining the soul in the face of that which it dislikes; and prayer. The singling out of this for mention is a way of emphasising its great importance; in one hadīth it is stated ‘When something bothered the Prophet s he would immediately resort to prayer’; it is said that the address here is to the Jews when greed and desire for leadership became impediments to their faith they were enjoined to forbearance which constituted fasting and prayer since the former stems from lust and the latter yields humility and negates pride. For it prayer is grievous burdensome except to the humble those that are at peace in obedience
ٱلَّذِينَ يَظُنُّونَ أَنَّهُم مُّلَـٰقُواْ رَبِّهِمْ وَأَنَّهُمْ إِلَيْهِ رَٰجِعُونَ,who reckon who are certain that they shall meet their Lord at the Resurrection and that to Him they are returning in the Hereafter where He will reward them.
يَٰبَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ ٱذْكُرُواْ نِعْمَتِي ٱلَّتِيۤ أَنْعَمْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ وَأَنِّي فَضَّلْتُكُمْ عَلَى ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ,O Children of Israel remember My favour wherewith I favoured you by giving thanks through obedience to Me and that I have preferred you your forefathers above all the worlds of their time;
وَٱتَّقُواْ يَوْماً لاَّ تَجْزِي نَفْسٌ عَن نَّفْسٍ شَيْئاً وَلاَ يُقْبَلُ مِنْهَا شَفَٰعَةٌ وَلاَ يُؤْخَذُ مِنْهَا عَدْلٌ وَلاَ هُمْ يُنْصَرُونَ,and fear be scared of the day when no soul for another shall give satisfaction which is the Day of Resurrection and no intercession shall be accepted read either tuqbal or yuqbal from it that is it is not the case that it has power to intercede for it then to be accepted from it or rejected as God says So now we have no intercessors Q. 26100; nor any compensation ransom be taken neither shall they be helped to avoid God’s chastisement.
وَإِذْ نَجَّيْنَٰكُم مِّنْ آلِ فِرْعَوْنَ يَسُومُونَكُمْ سُوۤءَ ٱلْعَذَابِ يُذَبِّحُونَ أَبْنَآءَكُمْ وَيَسْتَحْيُونَ نِسَآءَكُمْ وَفِي ذَٰلِكُمْ بَلاۤءٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ عَظِيمٌ,And remember when We delivered you your forefathers the address here and henceforth directed to those living at the time of the our Prophet is about how God blessed their forefathers and is intended to remind them of God’s grace so that they might believe; from the folk of Pharaoh who were visiting you with that is making you taste evil chastisement of the worst kind the sentence here is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the person of the pronoun suffixed in najjaynākum ‘We delivered you’; slaughtering your newly-born sons this is explaining what has just been said; and sparing retaining your women doing so because of the saying of some of their priests that a child born among the Israelites shall bring about the end of your rule Pharaoh; and for you therein chastisement or deliverance was a tremendous trial a test or a grace from your Lord.
وَإِذْ فَرَقْنَا بِكُمُ ٱلْبَحْرَ فَأَنجَيْنَٰكُمْ وَأَغْرَقْنَا آلَ فِرْعَوْنَ وَأَنْتُمْ تَنظُرُونَ,And remember when We divided split in two for you on account of you the sea such that you were able to cross it and escape from your enemy; and We delivered you from drowning and drowned Pharaoh’s folk his people with him while you were beholding the sea crashing down on top of them.
وَإِذْ وَٰعَدْنَا مُوسَىٰ أَرْبَعِينَ لَيْلَةً ثُمَّ ٱتَّخَذْتُمُ ٱلْعِجْلَ مِن بَعْدِهِ وَأَنْتُمْ ظَٰلِمُونَ,And when We appointed for wā‘adnā or wa‘adnā Moses forty nights at the end of which We shall give him the Torah for you to implement then you took to yourselves the calf the one which the Samaritan fashioned for you as a god after him that is after he departed for Our appointment and you were evildoers for taking it in worship because you directed your worship to the wrong place.
ثُمَّ عَفَوْنَا عَنكُم مِّن بَعْدِ ذَلِكَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ,Then We pardoned you erasing your sins after that act of worship so that you might be thankful for Our favour upon you.
وَإِذْ آتَيْنَا مُوسَى ٱلْكِتَابَ وَٱلْفُرْقَانَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَهْتَدُونَ,And when We gave to Moses the Scripture the Torah and the Criterion wa’l-furqān is an explicative supplement of Torah that is the one that discriminates faraqa between truth and falsehood and between what is licit and illicit so that you might be guided by it away from error.
وَإِذْ قَالَ مُوسَىٰ لِقَوْمِهِ يَٰقَوْمِ إِنَّكُمْ ظَلَمْتُمْ أَنْفُسَكُمْ بِٱتِّخَاذِكُمُ ٱلْعِجْلَ فَتُوبُوۤاْ إِلَىٰ بَارِئِكُمْ فَٱقْتُلُوۤاْ أَنفُسَكُمْ ذَٰلِكُمْ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ عِنْدَ بَارِئِكُمْ فَتَابَ عَلَيْكُمْ إِنَّهُ هُوَ ٱلتَّوَّابُ ٱلرَّحِيمُ,And when Moses said to his people those who worshipped the calf ‘My people you have done wrong against yourselves by your taking the golden calf for a god; now turn to your Creator away from that worship of the calf and slay one another that is let the innocent of you slay the guilty; That slaughter will be better for you in your Creator’s sight’ who made it easier for you to accomplish this and sent down a dark cloud over you so that none of you was able to see the other and show him mercy such that almost seventy thousand of you were killed; and He will turn to you relenting before your turning in repentance; truly He is the Relenting the Merciful.
وَإِذْ قُلْتُمْ يَٰمُوسَىٰ لَن نُّؤْمِنَ لَكَ حَتَّىٰ نَرَى ٱللَّهَ جَهْرَةً فَأَخَذَتْكُمُ ٱلصَّٰعِقَةُ وَأَنْتُمْ تَنظُرُونَ,And when you said having gone out with Moses to apologise before God for your worship of the calf and having heard what he had said to you; ‘O Moses we will not believe you till we see God openly’ with our own eyes; and the thunderbolt the shout took you and you died while you were beholding what was happening to you.
ثُمَّ بَعَثْنَٰكُم مِّن بَعْدِ مَوْتِكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ,Then We raised you up brought you back to life after you were dead so that you might be thankful for this favour of Ours.
وَظَلَّلْنَا عَلَيْكُمُ ٱلْغَمَامَ وَأَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْكُمُ ٱلْمَنَّ وَٱلسَّلْوَىٰ كُلُواْ مِن طَيِّبَٰتِ مَا رَزَقْنَٱكُمْ وَمَا ظَلَمُونَا وَلَـٰكِن كَانُوۤاْ أَنْفُسَهُمْ يَظْلِمُونَ,And We made the cloud overshadow you that is We sheltered you with fine clouds from the heat of the sun while you were in the wilderness; and We sent down in them the clouds upon you manna and quails — which are respectively a type of citrus known as turunjabīn and the quail — and We said ‘Eat of the good things We have provided for you’ and do not store any of it away but they were not grateful for this favour and stored the food and so they were deprived of it; And they did not wrong Us in this but themselves they wronged since the evil consequences of this befell them.
وَإِذْ قُلْنَا ٱدْخُلُواْ هَـٰذِهِ ٱلْقَرْيَةَ فَكُلُواْ مِنْهَا حَيْثُ شِئْتُمْ رَغَداً وَٱدْخُلُواْ ٱلْبَابَ سُجَّداً وَقُولُواْ حِطَّةٌ نَّغْفِرْ لَكُمْ خَطَٰيَٰكُمْ وَسَنَزِيدُ ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,And when We said to them after they came out of the wilderness ‘Enter this city either the Holy House of Jerusalem Bayt al-Maqdis or Jericho Arīhā and eat freely therein wherever you will plentifully and without any restrictions and enter it at the gate its gate prostrating bowing and say ‘our request is for an exoneration’ that is ‘That we be exonerated from our transgressions’ and We shall forgive naghfir a variant reading has one of the two passive forms yughfar or tughfar ‘they will be forgiven’ you your transgressions and We shall give more to those who are virtuous’ — through obedience — in terms of reward.
فَبَدَّلَ ٱلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ قَوْلاً غَيْرَ ٱلَّذِي قِيلَ لَهُمْ فَأَنزَلْنَا عَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ رِجْزاً مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ بِمَا كَانُواْ يَفْسُقُونَ,Then the evildoers among them substituted a saying other than that which had been said to them and said instead ‘A grain inside a hair’ and entered the town dragging themselves on their rears; so We sent down upon the evildoers the replacement of the second person of the previous verse with the overt identification in the third person alladhīna zalamū ‘the evildoers’ is intended to emphasise the depravity of their action wrath a punishment of plague from the heaven for their wickedness for deviating from obedience and within a very short period of time just under seventy thousand of them were dead.
وَإِذِ ٱسْتَسْقَىٰ مُوسَىٰ لِقَوْمِهِ فَقُلْنَا ٱضْرِب بِّعَصَاكَ ٱلْحَجَرَ فَٱنفَجَرَتْ مِنْهُ ٱثْنَتَا عَشْرَةَ عَيْناً قَدْ عَلِمَ كُلُّ أُنَاسٍ مَّشْرَبَهُمْ كُلُواْ وَٱشْرَبُواْ مِن رِّزْقِ ٱللَّهِ وَلاَ تَعْثَوْاْ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ مُفْسِدِينَ,And mention when Moses sought water for his people for they suffered thirst in the wilderness We said ‘Strike with your staff the rock the one that ran off with his robe a light cube-like rock about the size of a man’s head made of marble and he struck it and there exploded there burst and gushed forth from it twelve fountains equal to the number of tribes each people each tribe among them came to know their drinking-place which they did not share with any of the others. And We said to them ‘Eat and drink of that which God has provided and do not be degenerate in the earth seeking corruption’ mufsidīn is a circumstantial qualifier emphasising its operator the subject of the verb lā ta‘thaw ‘do not be degenerate’ derived from ‘athiya meaning afsada ‘to corrupt’.
وَإِذْ قُلْتُمْ يَٰمُوسَىٰ لَن نَّصْبِرَ عَلَىٰ طَعَامٍ وَاحِدٍ فَٱدْعُ لَنَا رَبَّكَ يُخْرِجْ لَنَا مِمَّا تُنْبِتُ ٱلأَرْضُ مِن بَقْلِهَا وَقِثَّآئِهَا وَفُومِهَا وَعَدَسِهَا وَبَصَلِهَا قَالَ أَتَسْتَبْدِلُونَ ٱلَّذِي هُوَ أَدْنَىٰ بِٱلَّذِي هُوَ خَيْرٌ ٱهْبِطُواْ مِصْراً فَإِنَّ لَكُمْ مَّا سَأَلْتُمْ وَضُرِبَتْ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلذِّلَّةُ وَٱلْمَسْكَنَةُ وَبَآءُو بِغَضَبٍ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ ذَلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ يَكْفُرُونَ بِآيَاتِ ٱللَّهِ وَيَقْتُلُونَ ٱلنَّبِيِّينَ بِغَيْرِ ٱلْحَقِّ ذٰلِكَ بِمَا عَصَواْ وَّكَانُواْ يَعْتَدُونَ,And when you said ‘Moses we will not endure one sort of food that is to say manna and quails; pray to your Lord for us that He may bring forth for us something of min here is explicative what the earth produces — green herbs cucumbers garlic lentils onions’ he Moses said to them ‘Would you exchange what is better more noble that is do you substitute this with what is lowlier?’ the hamza of a-tastabdilūna is for rebuke; they thus refused to change their mind and he Moses supplicated to God and He exalted be He said ‘Go down to a city whichever city it may be; you shall have there what you demanded’ of vegetable produce; And abasement submissiveness and wretchedness that is the signs of poverty on account of their submissiveness and debasement that always accompany them even if they be rich in the same way that a coin never changes its mint; were cast upon them and they incurred ended up with God’s wrath; that that is that affliction and wrath was because they used to disbelieve the signs of God and slay prophets such as Zachariah and John without right that is unjustly; that was because they disobeyed and they were transgressors overstepping the bounds in disobedience here the repetition dhālik bi-mā ‘asaw wa-kānū ya‘tadūn is for emphasis.
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَٱلَّذِينَ هَادُواْ وَٱلنَّصَارَىٰ وَٱلصَّابِئِينَ مَنْ آمَنَ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلآخِرِ وَعَمِلَ صَالِحاً فَلَهُمْ أَجْرُهُمْ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ وَلاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلاَ هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ,Surely those who believe who believed before in the prophets and those of Jewry the Jews and the Christians and the Sabaeans a Christian or Jewish sect whoever from among them believes in God and the Last Day in the time of our Prophet and performs righteous deeds according to the Law given to him — their wage that is the reward for their deeds is with their Lord and no fear shall befall them neither shall they grieve the singular person of the verbs āmana ‘believes’ and ‘amila ‘performs’ takes account of the singular form of man ‘whoever’ but in what comes afterwards of the plural pronouns its plural meaning is taken into account.
وَإِذْ أَخَذْنَا مِيثَاقَكُمْ وَرَفَعْنَا فَوْقَكُمُ ٱلطُّورَ خُذُواْ مَآ ءَاتَيْنَٰكُم بِقُوَّةٍ وَٱذْكُرُواْ مَا فِيهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ,And mention when We made a covenant with you your pledge to act according to what is in the Torah and We had raised above you the Mount which We uprooted from the earth and placed above you when you refused to accept it sc. the Torah and We said ‘Take forcefully seriously and with effort what We have given you and remember what is in it acting in accordance with it so that you might preserve yourselves’ from the Fire or acts of disobedience.
ثُمَّ تَوَلَّيْتُمْ مِّن بَعْدِ ذٰلِكَ فَلَوْلاَ فَضْلُ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ وَرَحْمَتُهُ لَكُنْتُم مِّنَ ٱلْخَاسِرِينَ,Then you turned away thereafter and but for God’s bounty and His mercy towards you you would have been among the losers there is no commentary on this verse.
وَلَقَدْ عَلِمْتُمُ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱعْتَدَواْ مِنْكُمْ فِي ٱلسَّبْتِ فَقُلْنَا لَهُمْ كُونُواْ قِرَدَةً خَاسِئِينَ,And verily wa-la-qad the lām is for oaths you know that there were those among you who transgressed violated the Sabbath by fishing when We had forbidden you to do so — these were the inhabitants of Eilat — and We said to them ‘Be apes despised!’ rejected and they became so they died three days later.
فَجَعَلْنَاهَا نَكَالاً لِّمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيْهَا وَمَا خَلْفَهَا وَمَوْعِظَةً لِّلْمُتَّقِينَ,And We made it this punishment an exemplary punishment a lesson to dissuade others from doing what they did; for all the former times and for the latter that is for the people of that time or those that came later; and an admonition to such as who fear God these are singled out for mention here because they in contrast to others are the ones who benefit thereby.
وَإِذْ قَالَ مُوسَىٰ لِقَوْمِهِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَأْمُرُكُمْ أَنْ تَذْبَحُواْ بَقَرَةً قَالُوۤاْ أَتَتَّخِذُنَا هُزُواً قَالَ أَعُوذُ بِٱللَّهِ أَنْ أَكُونَ مِنَ ٱلْجَاهِلِينَ,And mention when Moses said to his people when one among them was killed and the killer was not known and so they asked Moses to pray to God to reveal the killer which he did; ‘God commands you to sacrifice a cow’. They said ‘Do you take us in mockery?’ that is making fun of us when you answer us like this? He said ‘I take refuge with I seek defence with God lest I should be one of the ignorant’ one of those who indulge in mockery.
قَالُواْ ٱدْعُ لَنَا رَبَّكَ يُبَيِّن لَّنَا مَا هِيَ قَالَ إِنَّهُ يَقُولُ إِنَّهَا بَقَرَةٌ لاَّ فَارِضٌ وَلاَ بِكْرٌ عَوَانٌ بَيْنَ ذٰلِكَ فَٱفْعَلُواْ مَا تُؤْمَرونَ,But when they realised that he was being serious They said ‘Pray to your Lord for us that He may make clear to us what she may be’ its true nature He Moses said ‘He God says she is a cow neither old nor virgin that is young middling between the two in terms of age; so do what you have been commanded’ by way of sacrificing it.
قَالُواْ ٱدْعُ لَنَا رَبَّكَ يُبَيِّن لَّنَا مَا لَوْنُهَا قَالَ إِنَّهُ يَقُولُ إِنَّهَا بَقَرَةٌ صَفْرَآءُ فَاقِـعٌ لَّوْنُهَا تَسُرُّ ٱلنَّاظِرِينَ,They said ‘Pray to your Lord for us that He make clear to us what her colour may be’ He said ‘He says she shall be a golden cow bright in colour that is of a very intense yellow gladdening to beholders its beauty will please those that look at it.
قَالُواْ ٱدْعُ لَنَا رَبَّكَ يُبَيِّن لَّنَا مَا هِيَ إِنَّ ٱلبَقَرَ تَشَابَهَ عَلَيْنَا وَإِنَّآ إِن شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ لَمُهْتَدُونَ,They said ‘Pray to your Lord for us that He make clear to us what she may be does it graze freely or is it used in labour?; the cows that is the species described in the way mentioned are all alike to us because there are many of them and we have not been able to find the one sought after; and if God wills we shall then be guided’ to it. In one hadīth it is reported ‘Had they not uttered the proviso inshā’a Llāh it would never have been made clear to them’.
قَالَ إِنَّهُ يَقُولُ إِنَّهَا بَقَرَةٌ لاَّ ذَلُولٌ تُثِيرُ ٱلأَرْضَ وَلاَ تَسْقِي ٱلْحَرْثَ مُسَلَّمَةٌ لاَّ شِيَةَ فِيهَا قَالُواْ ٱلآنَ جِئْتَ بِٱلْحَقِّ فَذَبَحُوهَا وَمَا كَادُواْ يَفْعَلُونَ,He said ‘He says she shall be a cow not broken not subdued for labour that is to plough the earth churning its soil for sowing tuthīr al-ard the clause describes the word dhalūl and constitutes part of the negation; or to water the tillage that is the land prepared for sowing; one safe from faults and the effects of toil; with no blemish of a colour other than her own on her’. They said ‘Now you have brought the truth’ that is now you have explained it clearly; they thus sought it out and found it with a boy very dutiful towards his mother and they eventually purchased it for the equivalent of its weight in gold; and so they sacrificed her even though they very nearly did not on account of its excessive cost. In a hadīth it is stated that ‘Had they sacrificed any cow it would have sufficed them but they made it difficult for themselves and so God made it difficult for them’.
وَإِذْ قَتَلْتُمْ نَفْساً فَٱدَّارَأْتُمْ فِيهَا وَٱللَّهُ مُخْرِجٌ مَّا كُنْتُمْ تَكْتُمُونَ,And when you killed a living soul and disputed thereon iddāra’tum the tā’ of the root-form itdāra’tum has been assimilated with the dāl — and God disclosed what you were hiding this is a parenthetical statement; the story begins here with wa-idh qataltum nafsan ‘and when you killed a soul’… and continues in the following
فَقُلْنَا ٱضْرِبُوهُ بِبَعْضِهَا كَذَلِكَ يُحْيِي ٱللَّهُ ٱلْمَوْتَىٰ وَيُرِيكُمْ آيَاتِهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ,so We said ‘Smite him the slain man with part of it’ and so when he was struck with its tongue or its tail he came back to life and said ‘So-and-so killed me’ and after pointing out two of his cousins he died; the two killers were denied the inheritance and were later killed. God says even so is the revival for God brings to life the dead and He shows you His signs the proofs of His power so that you might understand that you might reflect and realise that the One capable of reviving a single soul is also capable of reviving a multitude of souls and then believe.
ثُمَّ قَسَتْ قُلُوبُكُمْ مِّن بَعْدِ ذٰلِكَ فَهِيَ كَٱلْحِجَارَةِ أَوْ أَشَدُّ قَسْوَةً وَإِنَّ مِنَ ٱلْحِجَارَةِ لَمَا يَتَفَجَّرُ مِنْهُ ٱلأَنْهَارُ وَإِنَّ مِنْهَا لَمَا يَشَّقَّقُ فَيَخْرُجُ مِنْهُ ٱلْمَآءُ وَإِنَّ مِنْهَا لَمَا يَهْبِطُ مِنْ خَشْيَةِ ٱللَّهِ وَمَا ٱللَّهُ بِغَافِلٍ عَمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ,Then your hearts became hardened O you Jews they your hearts became stiffened against acceptance of the truth thereafter that is after what is mentioned of the bringing back to life of the slain man and the other signs before this; and they are like stones in their hardness or even yet harder than these; for there are stones from which rivers come gushing and others split yashshaqqaq the initial tā’ of the root-form yatashaqqaq has been assimilated with the shīn so that water issues from them; and others come down from on high in fear of God while your hearts are unmoved unstirred and not humbled; And God is not heedless of what you do but instead He gives you respite until your time comes ta‘malūna ‘you do’ a variant reading has ya‘malūna ‘they do’ indicating a shift to the third person address.
أَفَتَطْمَعُونَ أَن يُؤْمِنُواْ لَكُمْ وَقَدْ كَانَ فَرِيقٌ مِّنْهُمْ يَسْمَعُونَ كَلاَمَ ٱللَّهِ ثُمَّ يُحَرِّفُونَهُ مِن بَعْدِ مَا عَقَلُوهُ وَهُمْ يَعْلَمُونَ,Are you then so eager O believers that they the Jews should believe you seeing there is a party of them a group of their rabbis that heard God’s word in the Torah and then tampered with it changing it and that after they had comprehended it after they had understood it knowingly? knowing full well that they were indulging in mendacity the hamza at the beginning of the verb a-fa-tatma‘ūn is an interrogative for rejection in other words ‘Do not be so eager for they have disbelieved before’.
وَإِذَا لَقُواْ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ قَالُوۤاْ آمَنَّا وَإِذَا خَلاَ بَعْضُهُمْ إِلَىٰ بَعْضٍ قَالُوۤاْ أَتُحَدِّثُونَهُم بِمَا فَتَحَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْكُمْ لِيُحَآجُّوكُم بِهِ عِنْدَ رَبِّكُمْ أَفَلاَ تَعْقِلُونَ,And when they the hypocrites from among the Jews meet those who believe they say ‘We believe’ that Muhammad (s) is a prophet and that he is the one of whom we have been given good tidings in our Book; but when they go in private one to another they their leaders the ones not involved in the hypocrisy say to those hypocrites ‘Do you speak to them the believers of what God has disclosed to you that is what He has made known to you of Muhammad’s s description in the Torah so that they may thereby dispute the lām of li-yuhājjūkum ‘that they may dispute with you’ is the lām of ‘becoming’ with you before your Lord? in the Hereafter and hold the proof against you for not following him Muhammad (s) despite your knowledge of his sincerity? Have you no understanding?’ of the fact that they will contend with you if you speak to them in this way? So beware.
أَوَلاَ يَعْلَمُونَ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَعْلَمُ مَا يُسِرُّونَ وَمَا يُعْلِنُونَ,God says Know they not the interrogative is affirmative the inserted wāw of a-wa-lā is to indicate the supplement that God knows what they keep secret and what they proclaim? that is what they hide and what they reveal in this matter and all other matters so that they may desist from these things.
وَمِنْهُمْ أُمِّيُّونَ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ ٱلْكِتَابَ إِلاَّ أَمَانِيَّ وَإِنْ هُمْ إِلاَّ يَظُنُّونَ,And there are some of them the Jews that are illiterate unlettered not knowing the Scripture the Torah but only desires lies which were handed down to them by their leaders and which they relied upon; and in their rejection of the prophethood of the Prophet and fabrications of other matters they have mere conjectures and no firm knowledge.
فَوَيْلٌ لِّلَّذِينَ يَكْتُبُونَ ٱلْكِتَابَ بِأَيْدِيهِمْ ثُمَّ يَقُولُونَ هَـٰذَا مِنْ عِنْدِ ٱللَّهِ لِيَشْتَرُواْ بِهِ ثَمَناً قَلِيلاً فَوَيْلٌ لَّهُمْ مِّمَّا كَتَبَتْ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَوَيْلٌ لَّهُمْ مِّمَّا يَكْسِبُونَ,So woe a severe chastisement to those who write the Scripture with their hands that is fabricating it themselves then say ‘This is from God’ that they may sell it for a small price of this world these are the Jews the ones that altered the description of the Prophet in the Torah as well as the ‘stoning’ verse and other details and rewrote them in a way different from that in which they were revealed. So woe to them for what their hands have written of fabrications and woe to them for their earnings by way of bribery rishan plural of rishwa.
وَقَالُواْ لَن تَمَسَّنَا ٱلنَّارُ إِلاَّ أَيَّاماً مَّعْدُودَةً قُلْ أَتَّخَذْتُمْ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ عَهْداً فَلَنْ يُخْلِفَ ٱللَّهُ عَهْدَهُ أَمْ تَقُولُونَ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ مَا لاَ تَعْلَمُونَ,And they say when the Prophet promised them the Fire ‘the Fire shall not touch us that is afflict us save a number of days’ only a short time of forty days the same length of time their forefathers worshipped the calf after which time it the Fire will cease. Say to them Muhammad (s) ‘Have you taken with God a covenant? a pledge from Him to this? God will not fail in His covenant in this matter or — nay — say you against God what you do not know? a’ttakhadhtum the conjunctive hamza has been omitted on account of the interrogative hamza sufficing.
بَلَىٰ مَن كَسَبَ سَيِّئَةً وَأَحَاطَتْ بِهِ خَطِيـۤئَتُهُ فَأُوْلَـۤئِكَ أَصْحَابُ ٱلنَّارِ هُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ,Not so it will touch you and you will abide therein; whoever earns evil through associating another with God and is encompassed by his transgression in the singular and the plural that is to say it overcomes him and encircles him totally for he has died an idolater — those are the inhabitants of the Fire therein abiding khālidūn this plural noun takes account of the plural import of man ‘whoever’.
وَٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ أُولَـٰئِكَ أَصْحَابُ ٱلْجَنَّةِ هُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ,And those who believe and perform righteous deeds — those are the inhabitants of Paradise therein abiding.
وَإِذْ أَخَذْنَا مِيثَاقَ بَنِيۤ إِسْرَائِيلَ لاَ تَعْبُدُونَ إِلاَّ ٱللَّهَ وَبِٱلْوَالِدَيْنِ إِحْسَاناً وَذِي ٱلْقُرْبَىٰ وَالْيَتَامَىٰ وَٱلْمَسَاكِينِ وَقُولُواْ لِلنَّاسِ حُسْناً وَأَقِيمُواْ ٱلصَّلاَةَ وَآتُواْ ٱلزَّكَاةَ ثُمَّ تَوَلَّيْتُمْ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً مِّنْكُمْ وَأَنْتُمْ مُّعْرِضُونَ,And mention when We made a covenant with the Children of Israel in the Torah where We said ‘You shall not worship a variant reading for lā ta‘budūna has third person plural lā ya‘budūn ‘they shall not worship’ any other than God lā ta‘budūna illā Llāha is a predicate denoting a prohibition; one may also read lā ta‘budū Worship you not; and to be good and righteous to parents and the near of kin here kinship is adjoined to parents; and to orphans and to the needy; and speak well good words to men commanding good and forbidding evil being truthful with regard to the status of Muhammad (s) and being kind to them sc. orphans and the needy a variant reading for hasanan has husnan the verbal noun used as a hyperbolic description; and observe prayer and pay the alms’ which you actually accepted but then you turned away refusing to fulfil these obligations here the second person address is used but their forefathers are still meant; all but a few of you rejecting it like your forefathers.
وَإِذْ أَخَذْنَا مِيثَاقَكُمْ لاَ تَسْفِكُونَ دِمَآءَكُمْ وَلاَ تُخْرِجُونَ أَنْفُسَكُمْ مِّن دِيَارِكُمْ ثُمَّ أَقْرَرْتُمْ وَأَنْتُمْ تَشْهَدُونَ,And when We made a covenant with you and We said ‘You shall not shed your own blood spilling it by slaying one another; neither expel your own from your habitations’ let no one of you expel the other from his house; then you confirmed it that is you accepted this covenant and you bore witness upon your own souls.
ثُمَّ أَنْتُمْ هَـٰؤُلاۤءِ تَقْتُلُونَ أَنْفُسَكُمْ وَتُخْرِجُونَ فَرِيقاً مِّنْكُمْ مِّن دِيَارِهِمْ تَظَاهَرُونَ عَلَيْهِمْ بِٱلإِثْمِ وَالْعُدْوَانِ وَإِن يَأتُوكُمْ أُسَارَىٰ تُفَادُوهُمْ وَهُوَ مُحَرَّمٌ عَلَيْكُمْ إِخْرَاجُهُمْ أَفَتُؤْمِنُونَ بِبَعْضِ ٱلْكِتَابِ وَتَكْفُرُونَ بِبَعْضٍ فَمَا جَزَآءُ مَن يَفْعَلُ ذٰلِكَ مِنكُمْ إِلاَّ خِزْيٌ فِي ٱلْحَيَاةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَيَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ يُرَدُّونَ إِلَىٰ أَشَدِّ ٱلّعَذَابِ وَمَا ٱللَّهُ بِغَافِلٍ عَمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ,Then there you are killing one another and expelling a party of you from their habitations conspiring tazzāharūna the original ta’ has been assimilated with the zā’; a variant reading has it without the assimilation that is tazāharūna assisting one another against them in sin in disobedience and enmity injustice and if they come to you as captives a variant reading for usārā has asrā you ransom them a variant reading for tafdūhum has tufādūhum that is to say you deliver them from captivity with money etc. and this ransoming was one of the things to which they were pledged; yet their expulsion was forbidden you muharramun ‘alaykum ikhrājuhum is semantically connected to wa-tukhrijūna ‘and expelling’ and the statement that comes in between is parenthetical that is expulsion was forbidden you in the same way that non-ransoming was forbidden you. Qurayza had allied themselves with the Aws and the Nadīr with the Khazraj but every member of an alliance would fight against a fellow ally thus destroying each other’s homes and expelling one another taking prisoners and then ransoming them. When they were asked ‘Why do you fight them and then pay their ransom?’ they would reply ‘Because we have been commanded to ransom’; and they would be asked ‘So why do you fight them then?’ to which they would say ‘For fear that our allies be humiliated’; God exalted says What do you believe in part of the Book that is the part about ransom and disbelieve in part? namely the part about renouncing fighting expulsion and assistance against one another; What shall be the requital of those of you who do that but degradation disgrace and ignominy in the life of this world they were disgraced when Qurayza were slewn and the Nadīr were expelled to Syria and ordered to pay the jizya; and on the Day of Resurrection to be returned to the most terrible of chastisement? And God is not heedless of what you do ta‘malūna or read ya‘malūna ‘they do’.
أُولَـٰئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱشْتَرَوُاْ ٱلْحَيَاةَ ٱلدُّنْيَا بِٱلآخِرَةِ فَلاَ يُخَفَّفُ عَنْهُمُ ٱلْعَذَابُ وَلاَ هُمْ يُنصَرُونَ,Those are the ones who have purchased the life of this world at the price of the Hereafter by preferring the former to the latter — for them the punishment shall not be lightened neither shall they be helped neither shall they be protected against it.
وَلَقَدْ آتَيْنَا مُوسَىٰ ٱلْكِتَابَ وَقَفَّيْنَا مِن بَعْدِهِ بِٱلرُّسُلِ وَآتَيْنَا عِيسَى ٱبْنَ مَرْيَمَ ٱلْبَيِّنَاتِ وَأَيَّدْنَاهُ بِرُوحِ ٱلْقُدُسِ أَفَكُلَّمَا جَآءَكُمْ رَسُولٌ بِمَا لاَ تَهْوَىٰ أَنْفُسُكُمْ ٱسْتَكْبَرْتُمْ فَفَرِيقاً كَذَّبْتُمْ وَفَرِيقاً تَقْتُلُونَ,And We gave Moses the Scripture the Torah and after him We sent successive messengers that is We sent them one after another and We gave Jesus son of Mary the clear proofs that is the miracles of bringing the dead back to life and healing the blind and the leper and We confirmed him We strengthened him with the Holy Spirit the expression rūh al-qudus is an example of annexing in a genitive construction the noun described to the adjective qualifying it in other words al-rūh al-muqaddasa that is Gabriel so described on account of his Jesus’s sanctity; he would accompany him Jesus wherever he went; still you refuse to be upright and whenever there came to you a messenger with what your souls did not desire did not like in the way of truth you became arrogant you disdained to follow him istakbartum ‘you became arrogant’ is the response to the particle kullamā ‘whenever’ and constitutes the interrogative and is meant as a rebuke; and some of them you called liars such as Jesus and some you slay? such as Zachariah and John the present tenses of these verbs are used to narrate the past events as though they were events in the present in other words ‘and some you slew’.
وَقَالُواْ قُلُوبُنَا غُلْفٌ بَل لَّعَنَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ بِكُفْرِهِمْ فَقَلِيلاً مَّا يُؤْمِنُونَ,And they say to the Prophet mockingly ‘Our hearts are encased’ ghulf is the plural of aghlaf that is to say wrapped up in covers and cannot comprehend what you say; God exalted be He says Nay bal introduces the rebuttal but God has cursed them removed them far from His mercy and degraded them when they rejected the messengers for their unbelief which is not the result of anything defective in their hearts; and little will they believe fa-qalīlan mā yu’minūn the mā here is extra emphasising the ‘littleness’ involved that is their belief is minimal.
وَلَمَّا جَآءَهُمْ كِتَابٌ مِّنْ عِندِ ٱللَّهِ مُصَدِّقٌ لِّمَا مَعَهُمْ وَكَانُواْ مِن قَبْلُ يَسْتَفْتِحُونَ عَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ فَلَمَّا جَآءَهُمْ مَّا عَرَفُواْ كَفَرُواْ بِهِ فَلَعْنَةُ ٱللَّهِ عَلَى ٱلْكَافِرِينَ,When there came to them a Book from God confirming what was with them in the Torah that is the Qur’ān — and they formerly before it came prayed for victory for assistance over the disbelievers saying ‘God give us assistance against them through the Prophet that shall be sent at the end of time’; but when there came to them what they recognised as the truth that is the mission of the Prophet they disbelieved in it out of envy and for fear of losing leadership the response to the first lammā particle is indicated by the response to the second one; and the curse of God is on the disbelievers.
بِئْسَمَا ٱشْتَرَوْاْ بِهِ أَنْفُسَهُمْ أَن يَكْفُرُواْ بِمَآ أنَزَلَ ٱللَّهُ بَغْياً أَن يُنَزِّلُ ٱللَّهُ مِن فَضْلِهِ عَلَىٰ مَن يَشَآءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ فَبَآءُو بِغَضَبٍ عَلَىٰ غَضَبٍ وَلِلْكَافِرِينَ عَذَابٌ مُّهِينٌ,Evil is that for which they sell their souls that is their share of the reward in the Hereafter bi’samā ‘evil is that for which’ mā here is an indefinite particle representing ‘a thing’ and constitutes a specification qualifying the subject of the verb bi’s ‘evil is’ the very thing being singled out for criticism; that they disbelieve in that Qur’ān which God has revealed grudging baghyan here is an object denoting reason for yakfurū ‘they disbelieve’ that is out of envy that God should reveal read either yunzil or yunazzil of His bounty the Inspiration to whomever He will of His servants to deliver the Message; and they were laden they returned with anger from God for their disbelief in what He has revealed the indefinite form bi-ghadabin ‘with anger’ is used to emphasise the awesomeness of the ‘anger’ upon anger which they deserved formerly when they neglected the Torah and disbelieved in Jesus; and for the disbelievers there shall be a humiliating chastisement.
وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمْ آمِنُواْ بِمَا أَنْزَلَ اللَّهُ قَالُواْ نُؤْمِنُ بِمَآ أُنْزِلَ عَلَيْنَا وَيَكْفُرونَ بِمَا وَرَآءَهُ وَهُوَ ٱلْحَقُّ مُصَدِّقاً لِّمَا مَعَهُمْ قُلْ فَلِمَ تَقْتُلُونَ أَنْبِيَآءَ ٱللَّهِ مِن قَبْلُ إِن كُنْتُمْ مُّؤْمِنِينَ,And when it was said to them ‘Believe in what God has revealed that is the Qur’ān and other Books they said ‘We believe in what was revealed to us’ that is the Torah; and wā here indicates a circumstantial qualifier they disbelieve in what is beyond that what is other than that or what came afterwards such as the Qur’ān; yet it is the truth wa-huwa’l-haqqu is a circumstantial qualifier confirming musaddiqan a second circumstantial qualifier for emphasis what is with them. Say to them ‘Why then were you slaying the prophets of God formerly if you were believers?’ in the Torah and in it you were forbidden to kill them this address concerning what their forefathers did is directed towards those present at the time of our Prophet on account of their approval of it that is of what the forefathers had done.
وَلَقَدْ جَآءَكُمْ مُّوسَىٰ بِٱلْبَيِّنَاتِ ثُمَّ ٱتَّخَذْتُمُ ٱلْعِجْلَ مِن بَعْدِهِ وَأَنْتُمْ ظَالِمُونَ,And Moses came to you with clear proofs miracles such as the staff his hand and the parting of the sea; then you took to yourselves the calf as a god after him after he had gone to the appointment and you were evildoers for taking it in worship.
وَإِذْ أَخَذْنَا مِيثَاقَكُمْ وَرَفَعْنَا فَوْقَكُمُ ٱلطُّورَ خُذُواْ مَآ ءَاتَيْنَٰكُم بِقُوَّةٍ وَٱسْمَعُواْ قَالُواْ سَمِعْنَا وَعَصَيْنَا وَأُشْرِبُواْ فِي قُلُوبِهِمُ ٱلْعِجْلَ بِكُفْرِهِمْ قُلْ بِئْسَمَا يَأْمُرُكُمْ بِهِ إِيمَانُكُمْ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ مُّؤْمِنِينَ,And when We made a covenant with you to act according to what is in the Torah and raised over you the Mount to drop it on you when you had refused to accept it; We said ‘Take forcefully seriously and with effort what We have given you and listen’ to what you have been commanded and be prepared to accept it They said ‘We hear your words and disobey’ your command; and they were made to drink the calf in their hearts that is to say the love of it the golden calf intoxicated their hearts in the way that wine does on account of their unbelief. Say to them ‘Evil is that thing which your belief in the Torah enjoins on you in the way of the worship of the golden calf if you are believers’ in it as you claim; meaning you are not believers for faith does not command that you worship the calf — their forefathers are meant here. Likewise you do not believe in the Torah because you have denied the prophethood of Muhammad (s) whereas faith in it does not command you to reject him.
قُلْ إِن كَانَتْ لَكُمُ ٱلدَّارُ ٱلآخِرَةُ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ خَالِصَةً مِّن دُونِ ٱلنَّاسِ فَتَمَنَّوُاْ ٱلْمَوْتَ إِن كُنْتُمْ صَادِقِينَ,Say to them ‘If the Abode of the Hereafter that is Paradise with God is purely yours that is exclusively and not for other people as you allege then long for death — if you speak truly’ here both conditionals are connected to the verb tamannū ‘long for’ so that the first is dependent upon the second in other words ‘If you speak truly when you claim that it is yours then you will naturally incline to what is yours and since the path to it is death long for it death’.
وَلَنْ يَتَمَنَّوْهُ أَبَداً بِمَا قَدَّمَتْ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ بِٱلظَّالِمينَ,But they will never long for it because of that which their own hands have sent before them as a result of their rejection of the Prophet s the consequence of their mendacity. God knows the evildoers the disbelievers and He will requite them.
وَلَتَجِدَنَّهُمْ أَحْرَصَ ٱلنَّاسِ عَلَىٰ حَيَاةٍ وَمِنَ ٱلَّذِينَ أَشْرَكُواْ يَوَدُّ أَحَدُهُمْ لَوْ يُعَمَّرُ أَلْفَ سَنَةٍ وَمَا هُوَ بِمُزَحْزِحِهِ مِنَ ٱلْعَذَابِ أَن يُعَمَّرَ وَٱللَّهُ بَصِيرٌ بِمَا يَعْمَلُونَ,And you shall find them the lām of la-tajidannahum is for oaths the people most covetous of life and more covetous of it than the idolaters who reject the idea of the Resurrection for the former know that their journey’s end will be the Fire while the idolaters do not believe even in this; any one of them would love wishes that he might be given life for a thousand years law yu‘ammar ‘if only he might be given life’ the particle law ‘if only’ relates to the verbal noun and functions with the sense of an ‘that’ and together with its relative clause explains the implicit verbal noun in the object of the verb yawaddu ‘he would love’; yet any one of them his being given life an yu‘ammara ‘that he should be given life’ constitutes the subject of the verb muzahzihihi ‘that it should budge him’ this verb comes later as though it were ta‘mīruhu ‘the giving of life to him’ shall not budge remove him from the chastisement of the Fire. God sees what they do ya‘malūna may be alternatively read ta‘malūna ‘you do’ and will requite them. ‘Abd Allāh Ibn Sūryā asked the Prophet s or ‘Umar b. al-Khattāb about which angel brings down the revelation and he replied that it was Gabriel; he Ibn Sūryā then said ‘He is our enemy because he brings chastisement with him; had it been Michael we would have believed in him because he brings fertility and security.’ Then the following was revealed
قُلْ مَن كَانَ عَدُوّاً لِّجِبْرِيلَ فَإِنَّهُ نَزَّلَهُ عَلَىٰ قَلْبِكَ بِإِذْنِ ٱللَّهِ مُصَدِّقاً لِّمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ وَهُدًى وَبُشْرَىٰ لِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,Say to them ‘Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel let him die in exasperation — he it was that brought it the Qur’ān down upon your heart by the leave by the command of God confirming what was before it of scriptures a guidance from error and good tidings of Paradise for the believers.
مَن كَانَ عَدُوّاً للَّهِ وَمَلاۤئِكَتِهِ وَرُسُلِهِ وَجِبْرِيلَ وَمِيكَٰلَ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَدُوٌّ لِّلْكَافِرِينَ,Whoever is an enemy to God and His angels and His messengers and Gabriel read Jibrīl or Jabrīl Jibra’il or Jabra’il Jibra’īl or Jabra’īl and Michael Mīkāl also read Mīkā’īl or Mīkā’il; a supplement to malā’ikatihi ‘His angels’ an example of the specific being supplemented to the collective — then surely God is an enemy to the disbelievers’ He says ‘to the disbelievers’ instead of ‘to them’ in order to point out their status.
وَلَقَدْ أَنْزَلْنَآ إِلَيْكَ آيَاتٍ بَيِّنَاتٍ وَمَا يَكْفُرُ بِهَآ إِلاَّ ٱلْفَاسِقُونَ,And We have revealed to you O Muhammad (s) clear proofs lucid ones bayyinātin ‘clear proofs’ is a circumstantial qualifier; this was in response to Ibn Sūryā saying to the Prophet s ‘You have not brought us anything’; and none disbelieves in them except the wicked these have disbelieved in them.
أَوَكُلَّمَا عَاهَدُواْ عَهْداً نَّبَذَهُ فَرِيقٌ مِّنْهُم بَلْ أَكْثَرُهُمْ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ,Why whenever they make a covenant with God that they will believe in the Prophet s when he appears or that they will not give assistance to the idolaters against the Prophet s does a party of them reject it? cast it away repudiating it this is the response to the clause beginning with kullamā the interrogative of rebuke. Nay bal indicates a transition but most of them are disbelievers.
وَلَمَّآ جَآءَهُمْ رَسُولٌ مِّنْ عِندِ ٱللَّهِ مُصَدِّقٌ لِّمَا مَعَهُمْ نَبَذَ فَرِيقٌ مِّنَ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ كِتَٰبَ ٱللَّهِ وَرَآءَ ظُهُورِهِمْ كَأَنَّهُمْ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ,When there came to them a messenger from God namely Muhammad (s) confirming what was with them a party of them who were given the Scripture have cast away the Scripture of God that is the Torah behind their backs that is to say they have not acted according to what it said about belief in the Messenger and otherwise; as though they did not know what is contained in it to the effect that he is a true Prophet or that it is the Book of God.
وَٱتَّبَعُواْ مَا تَتْلُواْ ٱلشَّيَـٰطِينُ عَلَىٰ مُلْكِ سُلَيْمَـٰنَ وَمَا كَفَرَ سُلَيْمَـٰنُ وَلَـٰكِنَّ ٱلشَّيَـٰطِينَ كَفَرُواْ يُعَلِّمُونَ ٱلنَّاسَ ٱلسِّحْرَ وَمَآ أُنْزِلَ عَلَى ٱلْمَلَكَيْنِ بِبَابِلَ هَـٰرُوتَ وَمَـٰرُوتَ وَمَا يُعَلِّمَانِ مِنْ أَحَدٍ حَتَّىٰ يَقُولاَ إِنَّمَا نَحْنُ فِتْنَةٌ فَلاَ تَكْفُرْ فَيَتَعَلَّمُونَ مِنْهُمَا مَا يُفَرِّقُونَ بِهِ بَيْنَ ٱلْمَرْءِ وَزَوْجِهِ وَمَا هُم بِضَآرِّينَ بِهِ مِنْ أَحَدٍ إِلاَّ بِإِذْنِ ٱللَّهِ وَيَتَعَلَّمُونَ مَا يَضُرُّهُمْ وَلاَ يَنفَعُهُمْ وَلَقَدْ عَلِمُواْ لَمَنِ ٱشْتَرَاهُ مَا لَهُ فِي ٱلآخِرَةِ مِنْ خَلَٰـقٍ وَلَبِئْسَ مَا شَرَوْاْ بِهِ أَنْفُسَهُمْ لَوْ كَانُواْ يَعْلَمُونَ,And they follow wa’ttaba‘ū is a supplement to nabadha ‘it cast away’ what the devils used to relate during the time of Solomon’s kingdom in the way of sorcery it is said that they the devils buried these books of sorcery underneath his throne when his kingdom was taken from him; it is also said that they used to listen stealthily and add fabrications to what they heard and then pass it on to the priests who would compile it in books; this would be disseminated and rumours spread that the jinn had knowledge of the Unseen. Solomon gathered these books and buried them. When he died the devils showed people where these books were and the latter brought them out and found that they contained sorcery and said ‘Your kingdom was only thanks to what is in here’; they then took to learning them and rejected the Scriptures of their prophets. In order to demonstrate Solomon’s innocence and in repudiation of the Jews when they said ‘Look at this Muhammad he mentions Solomon as one of the prophets when he was only a sorcerer’ God exalted says Solomon disbelieved not that is he did not work magic because he disbelieved but the devils disbelieved teaching the people sorcery this sentence is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the person governing the verb kafarū; and teaching them that which was revealed to the two angels that is the sorcery that they were inspired to perform al-malakayn ‘the two angels’ a variant reading has al-malikayn ‘the two kings’ who were in Babylon — a town in lower Iraq — Hārūt and Mārūt here the names are standing in for ‘the two angels’ or an explication of the latter. Ibn ‘Abbās said ‘They were two sorcerers who used to teach people magic’; it is also said that they were two angels that had been sent to teach sorcery to people as a trial from God. They taught not any man without them saying by way of counsel ‘We are but a temptation a trial from God for people so that He may test them when they are taught it whoever learns it is a disbeliever but whoever renounces it he is a believer; do not disbelieve’ by learning it; if this person refused and insisted on learning it they would teach him.
وَلَوْ أَنَّهُمْ آمَنُواْ وٱتَّقَوْا لَمَثُوبَةٌ مِّنْ عِندِ ٱللَّهِ خَيْرٌ لَّوْ كَانُواْ يَعْلَمُونَ,Yet if only they the Jews had believed in the Prophet and the Qur’ān and been fearful of God’s chastisement by abandoning acts of disobedience towards Him such as sorcery the response to the conditional clause beginning with law ‘if’ has been omitted but it is intimated to be ‘they would have been rewarded’ and this is indicated by His following words verily a reward from God would have been better than that for which they sold themselves if they had but known that this is better they would not have preferred that over this la-mathūbatun ‘verily the reward’ is the subject; the lām is that of oaths; and min ‘indi’Llāhi khayrun ‘from God would have been better’ is the predicate.
يَٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ لاَ تَقُولُواْ رَاعِنَا وَقُولُواْ ٱنْظُرْنَا وَٱسْمَعُواْ وَلِلكَافِرِينَ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,O you who believe do not say to the Prophet s ‘Observe us’ rā‘inā is an imperative form from murā‘āt which they used to say to him and this was a derogatory term in Hebrew derived from the noun al-ru‘ūna ‘thoughtlessness’. They found this very amusing and used to address the Prophet s in this way and so the believers were forbidden to use it; but say instead ‘Regard us’ that is look at us and give ear to what you are commanded and be prepared to accept it; and for disbelievers awaits a painful chastisement that is the Fire.
مَّا يَوَدُّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِنْ أَهْلِ ٱلْكِتَابِ وَلاَ ٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ أَن يُنَزَّلَ عَلَيْكُمْ مِّنْ خَيْرٍ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ يَخْتَصُّ بِرَحْمَتِهِ مَن يَشَآءُ وَٱللَّهُ ذُو ٱلْفَضْلِ ٱلْعَظِيمِ,Those disbelievers of the People of the Scripture and the idolaters from among the Arabs al-mushrikīna ‘idolaters’ is a supplement to ahl al-kitābi ‘People of the Scripture’ and the min ‘of’ is explicative do not wish that any good any Inspiration should be revealed to you from your Lord out of envy of you but God singles out for His mercy for the office of His Prophet whom He will; God is of bounty abounding.
مَا نَنسَخْ مِنْ آيَةٍ أَوْ نُنسِهَا نَأْتِ بِخَيْرٍ مِّنْهَا أَوْ مِثْلِهَا أَلَمْ تَعْلَمْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,When the disbelievers began to deride the matter of abrogation saying that one day Muhammad enjoins his Companions to one thing and then the next day he forbids it God revealed And whatever verse mā is the conditional particle that has been revealed containing a judgement We abrogate either together with its recital or not that is only its judgement but its recital continues; there is a variant reading nunsikh meaning ‘Whatever verse We command you or Gabriel to abrogate’ or postpone so that We do not reveal the judgement contained in it and We withhold its recital or retain it in the Preserved Tablet; a variant reading of nunsi’hā is nunsihā from ‘to forget’ so ‘Whatever verse We abrogate or We make you forget that is We erase from your heart’; the response to the conditional sentence begun with mā is We bring in place a better one that is more beneficial for Our servants either because it is easier to implement or contains much reward; or the like of it in terms of religious obligation and reward; do you not know that God has power over all things? including abrogating and substituting verses? the interrogative here is meant as an affirmative.
أَلَمْ تَعْلَمْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَهُ مُلْكُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَمَا لَكُمْ مِّن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ مِن وَلِيٍّ وَلاَ نَصِيرٍ,Do you not know that to God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth doing what He pleases and that you have none besides God other than God neither protector to safeguard you nor helper? to keep away His chastisement when it comes.
أَمْ تُرِيدُونَ أَن تَسْأَلُواْ رَسُولَكُمْ كَمَا سُئِلَ مُوسَىٰ مِن قَبْلُ وَمَن يَتَبَدَّلِ ٱلْكُفْرَ بِٱلإِيمَانِ فَقَدْ ضَلَّ سَوَآءَ ٱلسَّبِيلِ,When the Meccans asked the Prophet to enlarge the size of Mecca and make Safā full of gold the following was revealed Or do you desire to question your Messenger as Moses was questioned by his people aforetime? when they asked him to show them God openly among other things; whoever exchanges belief for unbelief taking the latter in place of the former by refraining from contemplating the clear proofs and by requesting others instead has surely strayed from the even way meaning he has mistaken the proper path al-sawā‘ essentially means al-wasat ‘middle way’.
وَدَّ كَثِيرٌ مِّنْ أَهْلِ ٱلْكِتَابِ لَوْ يَرُدُّونَكُم مِنْ بَعْدِ إِيمَانِكُمْ كُفَّاراً حَسَداً مِّنْ عِنْدِ أَنْفُسِهِمْ مِّن بَعْدِ مَا تَبَيَّنَ لَهُمُ ٱلْحَقُّ فَٱعْفُواْ وَٱصْفَحُواْ حَتَّىٰ يَأْتِيَ ٱللَّهُ بِأَمْرِهِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,Many of the People of the Scripture long that law ‘if only that’ represents the import of the verbal noun they might make you disbelievers after you have believed from the envy hasadan is the object denoting reason being of their own souls that is to say their wicked souls have prompted them to this attitude; after the truth with regard to the Prophet s has become clear to them in the Torah; yet pardon leave them be and be forgiving stay away and make no encroachments against them till God brings His command concerning fighting them; truly God has power over all things.
وَأَقِيمُواْ ٱلصَّلَٰوةَ وَآتُواْ ٱلزَّكَٰوةَ وَمَا تُقَدِّمُواْ لأَنْفُسِكُم مِّنْ خَيْرٍ تَجِدُوهُ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ,And perform the prayer and pay the alms; whatever good in the way of obedience such as observing kinship and charity you shall offer for your own souls you shall find it that is its reward with God; assuredly God sees what you do and will requite you for it.
وَقَالُواْ لَن يَدْخُلَ ٱلْجَنَّةَ إِلاَّ مَن كَانَ هُوداً أَوْ نَصَارَىٰ تِلْكَ أَمَانِيُّهُمْ قُلْ هَاتُواْ بُرْهَانَكُمْ إِن كُنْتُمْ صَادِقِينَ,And they say ‘None shall enter Paradise except those who are Jews hūd is the plural of hā’id or Christians’ this is what the Jews of Medina and the Christians of Najrān said when they disputed with the Prophet s each party separately claiming Paradise for its members exclusively. Such sayings are their desires their false passions. Say to them ‘Produce your proof your evidence for this if you speak truly’ in this matter.
بَلَىٰ مَنْ أَسْلَمَ وَجْهَهُ للَّهِ وَهُوَ مُحْسِنٌ فَلَهُ أَجْرُهُ عِندَ رَبِّهِ وَلاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلاَ هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ,Nay but others will also enter Paradise namely whoever submits his purpose to God that is adheres to His commands wajh ‘face’ sc. ‘purpose’ is here mentioned because it is the most noble part of the body so that when it has submitted there is all the more reason for the other parts to follow being virtuous affirming God’s Oneness his reward is with his Lord the reward of his deeds being Paradise and no fear shall befall them neither shall they grieve in the Hereafter.
وَقَالَتِ ٱلْيَهُودُ لَيْسَتِ ٱلنَّصَارَىٰ عَلَىٰ شَيْءٍ وَقَالَتِ ٱلنَّصَارَىٰ لَيْسَتِ ٱلْيَهُودُ عَلَىٰ شَيْءٍ وَهُمْ يَتْلُونَ ٱلْكِتَابَ كَذَلِكَ قَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ مِثْلَ قَوْلِهِمْ فَٱللَّهُ يَحْكُمُ بَيْنَهُمْ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ فِيمَا كَانُواْ فِيهِ يَخْتَلِفُونَ,The Jews say ‘The Christians stand on nothing’ that can be used as support for their claims and they rejected Jesus; and the Christians say ‘The Jews stand on nothing’ that can be used as support for their claims and they rejected Moses; yet they both groups recite the Scripture revealed to them in the Scripture of the Jews there is the confirmation of Jesus and in that of the Christians there is the confirmation of Moses yatlūna’l-kitāba ‘they recite the Scripture’ the sentence is a circumstantial qualifier. Thus in the way that these have said the ignorant from among the Arabs and others say the like of what these say this last phrase mithla qawlihim ‘the like of what they say’ is the explication of dhālika ‘that way’ that is to say to every person of religion they would say ‘You have no basis’; God shall decide between them on the Day of Resurrection regarding their differences in religion and will admit the confirmer into Paradise and the falsifier into the Fire.
وَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّنْ مَّنَعَ مَسَاجِدَ ٱللَّهِ أَن يُذْكَرَ فِيهَا ٱسْمُهُ وَسَعَىٰ فِي خَرَابِهَآ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ مَا كَانَ لَهُمْ أَن يَدْخُلُوهَآ إِلاَّ خَآئِفِينَ لَّهُمْ فِي ٱلدُّنْيَا خِزْيٌ وَلَهُمْ فِي ٱلآخِرَةِ عَذَابٌ عَظِيمٌ,And who does greater evil — that is none does more evil — than he who bars God’s places of worship so that His Name be not invoked in them in prayer and praise and strives to ruin them? through destruction and impeding people from them this was revealed to inform of the Byzantines’ destruction of the Holy House sc. Jerusalem or it was revealed when the idolaters barred the Prophet s from entering Mecca in the year of the battle of Hudaybiyya; such men might never enter them save in fear illā khā’ifīna is a predicate also functioning as a command that is to say ‘Frighten them by threats of waging war against them so that not one of them shall enter it feeling secure’; for them in this world is degradation debasement through being killed taken captive and forced to pay the jizya; and in the Hereafter a mighty chastisement namely the Fire.
وَللَّهِ ٱلْمَشْرِقُ وَٱلْمَغْرِبُ فَأَيْنَمَا تُوَلُّواْ فَثَمَّ وَجْهُ ٱللَّهِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ وَاسِعٌ عَلِيمٌ,The following was revealed either when the Jews criticised the change of the direction of prayer qibla or concerning the supererogatory prayers on animal-back during journeys which one may pray in any direction To God belong the East and the West that is the entire earth because these two directions represent both sides of it the earth; whithersoever you turn your faces in prayer by His command there is the Face of God the direction of prayer with which He is pleased. Lo! God is Embracing His bounty embracing all things Knowing how to manage His creation.
وَقَالُواْ ٱتَّخَذَ ٱللَّهُ وَلَداً سُبْحَـٰنَهُ بَل لَّهُ مَا فِي ٱلسَّمَـٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ كُلٌّ لَّهُ قَانِتُونَ,And they the Jews and the Christians and those that claim that the angels are God’s daughters say read wa-qālū or simply qālū ‘God has taken to Himself a son’; God says Glory be to Him! as a way of exalting Himself above this; Nay to Him belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth as possessions creatures and servants and this sovereignty contradicts having a child and is expressed by the particle mā ‘all that’ in order to include all creation that is not rational; all obey His will submitting to that which is required from each one of them here the emphasis is on rational beings.
بَدِيعُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَإِذَا قَضَىٰ أَمْراً فَإِنَّمَا يَقُولُ لَهُ كُنْ فَيَكُونُ,Creator of the heavens and the earth making them exist without any exemplary precedent; and when He decrees wills a thing to exist He but says to it ‘Be’ and it is that is to say it becomes fa-yakūnu a variant reading has fa-yakūna on account of it being the response in the subjunctive mood to the jussive statement.
وَقَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ لَوْلاَ يُكَلِّمُنَا ٱللَّهُ أَوْ تَأْتِينَآ آيَةٌ كَذَلِكَ قَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ مِّثْلَ قَوْلِهِمْ تَشَابَهَتْ قُلُوبُهُمْ قَدْ بَيَّنَّا ٱلآيَاتِ لِقَوْمٍ يُوقِنُونَ,And they that is the disbelievers of Mecca who do not know say to the Prophet s ‘Why does God not speak to us? to say that you are His Messenger; Why does a sign not come to us?’ of the sort we have requested in order to show your sincerity. So in the same way that these disbelievers have spoken spoke those before them from among past communities to their prophets the like of what they say in their obstinacy and demand for signs; their hearts are much alike in terms of unbelief and stubbornness this is meant as consolation for the Prophet s. Yet We have made clear the signs to a people who are certain a people who know that these are God’s signs and so they believe in them for to request other signs would be obduracy.
إِنَّا أَرْسَلْنَاكَ بِٱلْحَقِّ بَشِيراً وَنَذِيراً وَلاَ تُسْأَلُ عَنْ أَصْحَابِ ٱلْجَحِيمِ,We have sent you Muhammad (s) with the truth the guidance a bearer of good tidings of Paradise for those who respond to this guidance and warner of the Fire to those who do not respond to it. You shall not be asked about the inhabitants of Hell-fire that is about why the disbelievers did not believe for your responsibility is only to deliver the Message a variant reading of lā tus’al is lā tas’al ‘do not ask’ with the final apocopation of the vowel on account of it being an imperative.
وَلَنْ تَرْضَىٰ عَنكَ ٱلْيَهُودُ وَلاَ ٱلنَّصَارَىٰ حَتَّىٰ تَتَّبِعَ مِلَّتَهُمْ قُلْ إِنَّ هُدَى ٱللَّهِ هُوَ ٱلْهُدَىٰ وَلَئِنِ ٱتَّبَعْتَ أَهْوَآءَهُمْ بَعْدَ ٱلَّذِي جَآءَكَ مِنَ ٱلْعِلْمِ مَا لَكَ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ مِن وَلِيٍّ وَلاَ نَصِيرٍ,Never will the Jews be pleased with you neither the Christians not until you follow their creed their religion Say ‘God’s guidance that is Islam is the true guidance’ besides which there is only error. And if you were wa-la-in the lām is for oaths to follow their whims hypothetically speaking whims to which they are calling you after the knowledge the Divine revelation that has come to you you shall have against God neither friend to protect you nor helper to defend you against Him.
ٱلَّذِينَ آتَيْنَاهُمُ ٱلْكِتَـٰبَ يَتْلُونَهُ حَقَّ تِلاَوَتِهِ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِهِ وَمن يَكْفُرْ بِهِ فَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْخَٰسِرُونَ,Those to whom We have given the Scripture this is the subject of the sentence and who recite it with true recitation that is who recite it as it was revealed haqqa tilāwatihi ‘its true recitation’ is a circumstantial qualifier; haqqa is in the accusative because it is the object of the verbal noun they believe in it this is the predicate this was revealed concerning a group of Ethiopians that presented themselves to the Prophet and accepted Islam; and whoever disbelieves in it that is in the revealed Book by distorting it they shall be the losers because they will be destined for the Fire made everlasting for them.
يَابَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ ٱذْكُرُواْ نِعْمَتِيَ ٱلَّتِيۤ أَنْعَمْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ وَأَنِّي فَضَّلْتُكُمْ عَلَى ٱلْعَالَمِينَ,O Children of Israel remember My favour wherewith I favoured you and that I have preferred you over all the worlds a similar verse has already been mentioned.
وَٱتَّقُواْ يَوْماً لاَّ تَجْزِي نَفْسٌ عَن نَّفْسٍ شَيْئاً وَلاَ يُقْبَلُ مِنْهَا عَدْلٌ وَلاَ تَنفَعُهَا شَفَاعَةٌ وَلاَ هُمْ يُنصَرُونَ,And beware of fear a day when no soul shall for another on this Day be requited that is when no soul for another shall be of any avail and no compensation no ransom shall be accepted from it nor any intercession shall benefit it neither shall they be helped against God’s chastisement.
وَإِذِ ٱبْتَلَىٰ إِبْرَاهِيمَ رَبُّهُ بِكَلِمَاتٍ فَأَتَمَّهُنَّ قَالَ إِنِّي جَاعِلُكَ لِلنَّاسِ إِمَاماً قَالَ وَمِن ذُرِّيَّتِي قَالَ لاَ يَنَالُ عَهْدِي ٱلظَّالِمِينَ,And mention when his Lord tested tried Abraham Ibrāhīm also read Ibrāhām with certain words with certain commands and prohibitions with which He charged him it is said that these included the rituals of the Pilgrimage the rinsing of the mouth snuffing up water into the nostrils to clean them cleaning of the teeth trimming facial hair combing of the hair trimming the fingernails shaving armpit and pubic hair circumcision and washing one’s private parts after elimination; and he fulfilled them he performed them thoroughly; He God exalted said to him ‘I make you a leader an exemplar in religion for the people.’ Said he ‘And of my seed?’ my progeny make leaders from among them; He said ‘My covenant of leadership shall not reach the evildoers’ the disbelievers from among them this indicates that the covenant will reach only those who are not evildoers.
وَإِذْ جَعَلْنَا ٱلْبَيْتَ مَثَابَةً لِّلنَّاسِ وَأَمْناً وَٱتَّخِذُواْ مِن مَّقَامِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ مُصَلًّى وَعَهِدْنَآ إِلَىٰ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَإِسْمَاعِيلَ أَن طَهِّرَا بَيْتِيَ لِلطَّائِفِينَ وَٱلْعَاكِفِينَ وَٱلرُّكَّعِ ٱلسُّجُودِ,And when We appointed the House the Ka‘ba to be a place of visitation to which they flock from every direction for the people and a sanctuary of safety for them from the injustice and attacks that befall other places a person could come across his father’s killer there and yet not act violently against him; and ‘Take ittakhidhū is also read ittakhadhū making it a predicate O people to yourselves Abraham’s station the founding stone he used when building the House for a place of prayer’ so that you perform two units of prayer for the circumambulation; And We made a covenant with Abraham and Ishmael We commanded them ‘Purify My House of graven images for those that shall go round it and those that cleave to it in ritual residence to those who bow and prostrate themselves’ that is those who pray al-rukka‘ and al-sujūd are the plurals of rāki‘ ‘one bowing’ and sājid ‘one prostrated’ respectively.
وَإِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ رَبِّ ٱجْعَلْ هَـٰذَا بَلَداً آمِناً وَٱرْزُقْ أَهْلَهُ مِنَ ٱلثَّمَرَاتِ مَنْ آمَنَ مِنْهُمْ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلآخِرِ قَالَ وَمَن كَفَرَ فَأُمَتِّعُهُ قَلِيلاً ثُمَّ أَضْطَرُّهُ إِلَىٰ عَذَابِ ٱلنَّارِ وَبِئْسَ ٱلْمَصِيرُ,And when Abraham said ‘My Lord make this place a land secure in which there is safety God granted him his request making it a sanctuary in which no human blood is shed no injustice is committed towards anyone no prey is hunted and which is never deserted in any of its parts; and provide its people with fruits something which actually happened when there came itinerants from as far as Syria whereas before it had been devoid of any vegetation or water; such of them as believe in God and the Last Day’ this phrase stands in place of its people and they are here singled out for mention in the request in accordance with God’s saying My covenant shall not reach the evildoers; He exalted said ‘And whoever disbelieves I will also provide with fruits to him I shall give enjoyment read either umti‘uhu or umatti‘uhu by granting him sustenance in this life a little the length of his life but then I shall compel him I shall drive him in the Hereafter to the chastisement of the Fire so that he cannot find an escape — how evil a journey’s end!’ a place to which to return.
وَإِذْ يَرْفَعُ إِبْرَٰهِيمُ ٱلْقَوَاعِدَ مِنَ ٱلْبَيْتِ وَإِسْمَٰعِيلُ رَبَّنَا تَقَبَّلْ مِنَّآ إِنَّكَ أَنتَ ٱلسَّمِيعُ ٱلْعَلِيمُ,And mention when Abraham raised up the foundations the supports or the walls of the House building it min al-bayt ‘of the House’ is semantically connected to yarfa‘u ‘raises up’ and Ishmael with him wa-Ismā‘īlu is a supplement to Ibrāhīmu both of them saying ‘Our Lord! Receive this building from us. Truly You are the Hearing of words the Knowing of deeds.
رَبَّنَا وَٱجْعَلْنَا مُسْلِمَيْنِ لَكَ وَمِن ذُرِّيَّتِنَآ أُمَّةً مُّسْلِمَةً لَّكَ وَأَرِنَا مَنَاسِكَنَا وَتُبْ عَلَيْنَآ إِنَّكَ أَنتَ ٱلتَّوَّابُ ٱلرَّحِيمُ,Our Lord! And make us submissive compliant to You and make of our seed our progeny a community a people submissive to You min in the phrase min dhurriyyatinā ‘of our seed’ here is partitive and is used here in accordance with God’s above-mentioned saying My covenant shall not reach the evildoers; and show us teach us our holy rites our ceremonies for worship or for the pilgrimage and relent to us. Surely You are the Relenting the Merciful they asked Him to turn towards them despite their moral impeccability out of humbleness and in order to teach their progeny.
رَبَّنَا وَٱبْعَثْ فِيهِمْ رَسُولاً مِّنْهُمْ يَتْلُواْ عَلَيْهِمْ آيَٰتِكَ وَيُعَلِّمُهُمُ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ وَٱلْحِكْمَةَ وَيُزَكِّيهِمْ إِنَّكَ أَنتَ ٱلعَزِيزُ ٱلحَكِيمُ,Our Lord! And send among them the people of this House a messenger one of them and God granted him this petition with the sending of Muhammad (s) who shall recite to them Your signs the Qur’ān and teach them the Book the Qur’ān and Wisdom that is what the former contains of judgments and purify them cleanse them of idolatry; You are the Mighty the Victor the Wise in His creation.
وَمَن يَرْغَبُ عَن مِّلَّةِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ إِلاَّ مَن سَفِهَ نَفْسَهُ وَلَقَدِ ٱصْطَفَيْنَاهُ فِي ٱلدُّنْيَا وَإِنَّهُ فِي ٱلآخِرَةِ لَمِنَ ٱلصَّالِحِينَ,Who therefore meaning ‘none’ shrinks from the religion of Abraham abandoning it except he who fools himself? that is to say either the one who ignores that his soul has been created for God and that it is obliged to worship Him or the one who treats it with frivolity and degrades it. Indeed We chose him We elected him in this world for prophethood and friendship and in the Hereafter he shall be among the righteous those of the high stations al-darajāt al-‘ulā cf. Q. 2075.
إِذْ قَالَ لَهُ رَبُّهُ أَسْلِمْ قَالَ أَسْلَمْتُ لِرَبِّ ٱلْعَالَمِينَ,And mention When his Lord said to him ‘Submit’ obey God and devote your religion purely to Him he said ‘I have submitted to the Lord of the Worlds’.
وَوَصَّىٰ بِهَآ إِبْرَاهِيمُ بَنِيهِ وَيَعْقُوبُ يَابَنِيَّ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ ٱصْطَفَىٰ لَكُمُ ٱلدِّينَ فَلاَ تَمُوتُنَّ إِلاَّ وَأَنْتُم مُّسْلِمُونَ,And Abraham enjoined wassā; may also be read awsā upon his sons this creed and so did Jacob upon his sons saying ‘My sons God has chosen for you the true religion the religion of submission to God islām see that you die not save in submission he forbade them from abandoning this submission to God and enjoined them to adhere firmly to it until death overtook them.
أَمْ كُنتُمْ شُهَدَآءَ إِذْ حَضَرَ يَعْقُوبَ ٱلْمَوْتُ إِذْ قَالَ لِبَنِيهِ مَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن بَعْدِي قَالُواْ نَعْبُدُ إِلَـٰهَكَ وَإِلَـٰهَ آبَائِكَ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَإِسْمَاعِيلَ وَإِسْحَاقَ إِلَـٰهاً وَاحِداً وَنَحْنُ لَهُ مُسْلِمُونَ,When the Jews said to the Prophet s ‘Do you not know that on the day of his death Jacob charged his sons with Judaism?’ the following was revealed Or were you witnesses present when death came to Jacob? When idh ‘when’ substitutes for the preceding idh he said to his sons ‘What will you worship after me?’ after I die?; They said ‘We will worship your God and the God of your fathers Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac in recognition of the predominant mention of the father figures Ishmael is also counted as a father and also because the status of an uncle is akin to that of a father One God ilāhan wāhidan ‘One God’ substitutes for ilāhaka ‘your God’ to Him we submit’ the initial am of the phrase am kuntum ‘Or were you …’ is similar to the hamza of denial sc. a-kuntum the sense being ‘You were not present at his death so how do you ascribe to him what does not befit him?’.
تِلْكَ أُمَّةٌ قَدْ خَلَتْ لَهَا مَا كَسَبَتْ وَلَكُمْ مَّا كَسَبْتُمْ وَلاَ تُسْأَلُونَ عَمَّا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ,That tilka is the subject of this sentence and denotes Abraham Jacob and his sons and is feminine because it agrees with the gender of its predicate is a community that has passed away has gone before; theirs is what they have earned the reward for their deeds lahā mā kasabat theirs is what they have earned’ constitutes the commencement of a new sentence and yours the Jews are being addressed here is what you have earned; you shall not be asked about what they did in the same way that they will not be asked about what you did this latter statement being an affirmation of the former.
وَقَالُواْ كُونُواْ هُوداً أَوْ نَصَارَىٰ تَهْتَدُواْ قُلْ بَلْ مِلَّةَ إِبْرَاهِيمَ حَنِيفاً وَمَا كَانَ مِنَ ٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ,And they say ‘Be Jews or Christians the particle aw is for detail; the first of these is the saying of the Medinan Jews while the second is that of the Christians of Najrān and you shall be guided’. Say to them ‘Nay we follow rather the creed of Abraham a hanīf hanīfan is a circumstantial qualifier referring to Ibrāhīma that is to say one that inclines away from all other religions to the upright religion; and he was not of the idolaters’.
قُولُوۤاْ آمَنَّا بِٱللَّهِ وَمَآ أُنْزِلَ إِلَيْنَا وَمَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَىٰ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَإِسْمَاعِيلَ وَإِسْحَاقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ وَٱلأَسْبَاطِ وَمَآ أُوتِيَ مُوسَىٰ وَعِيسَىٰ وَمَا أُوتِيَ ٱلنَّبِيُّونَ مِن رَّبِّهِمْ لاَ نُفَرِّقُ بَيْنَ أَحَدٍ مِّنْهُمْ وَنَحْنُ لَهُ مُسْلِمُونَ,Say this address is to the believers ‘We believe in God and in that which has been revealed to us the Qur’ān and revealed to Abraham the ten scrolls Ishmael Isaac Jacob and the Tribes his sons and that which was given to Moses the Torah and Jesus the Gospel and the prophets from their Lord of Books and signs we make no division between any of them believing in some and disbelieving in others in the manner of Jews and Christians and to Him we submit’.
فَإِنْ آمَنُواْ بِمِثْلِ مَآ آمَنْتُمْ بِهِ فَقَدِ ٱهْتَدَواْ وَّإِن تَوَلَّوْاْ فَإِنَّمَا هُمْ فِي شِقَاقٍ فَسَيَكْفِيكَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ وَهُوَ ٱلسَّمِيعُ ٱلْعَلِيمُ,And if they the Jews and the Christians believe in the like mithl ‘the like’ is extra of what you believe in then they are truly guided; but if they turn away from belief in it then they are clearly in schism in opposition to you; God will suffice you O Muhammad (s) against them and their schisms; He is the Hearer of their sayings the Knower of their circumstances God sufficed him with regard to them by killing Qurayza expelling Nadīr and exacting the jizya from them.
صِبْغَةَ ٱللَّهِ وَمَنْ أَحْسَنُ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ صِبْغَةً وَنَحْنُ لَهُ عَابِدونَ,The mark of God sibghata’Llāhi a verbal noun reaffirming the earlier āmannā and it is in the accusative because of the verbal construction implied that is to say sabaghanā’Llāhu ‘God has marked us’ this denotes His religion the one towards which He made human beings naturally inclined as it leaves its mark on a person in the same way that a dye leaves its mark on a garment; and who has that is none has a better mark sibghatan ‘marking’ is for specification than God? And Him we worship the Jews said to the Muslims ‘We are the people of the first Book and our direction of prayer qibla is more ancient and prophets were never sent from among the Arabs; if Muhammad were a prophet he would have been one of us’. Thus the following was revealed
قُلْ أَتُحَآجُّونَنَا فِي اللَّهِ وَهُوَ رَبُّنَا وَرَبُّكُمْ وَلَنَآ أَعْمَالُنَا وَلَكُمْ أَعْمَالُكُمْ وَنَحْنُ لَهُ مُخْلِصُونَ,Say to them ‘Would you then dispute with us concerning God that He chose a prophet from among the Arabs and He is our Lord and your Lord? and so it is for Him to choose whom He will Our deeds belong to us for which we will be requited and to you belong your deeds for which you will be requited so that it is not improbable that among our deeds there will be those for which we will deserve to be honoured; and to Him we are sincerely devoted in religion and in deed unlike you hence we are more worthy to be chosen the hamza of a-tuhājjūnanā ‘would you then dispute’ is for rejection and the three clauses that follow it are all circumstantial qualifiers.
أَمْ تَقُولُونَ إِنَّ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَإِسْمَاعِيلَ وَإِسْحَـاقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ وَالأَسْبَاطَ كَانُواْ هُوداً أَوْ نَصَارَىٰ قُلْ أَأَنْتُمْ أَعْلَمُ أَمِ ٱللَّهُ وَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّنْ كَتَمَ شَهَادَةً عِندَهُ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ وَمَا ٱللَّهُ بِغَافِلٍ عَمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ,Or nay do you say taqūlūna also read yaqūlūna ‘do they say?’ ‘Abraham Ishmael Isaac and Jacob and the Tribes — they were Jews or they were Christians?’ Say to them ‘Have you then greater knowledge or has God? that is God has greater knowledge; He dissociated Abraham from both groups when He said Abraham was not a Jew nor a Christian Q. 367; and those mentioned with him Abraham are his followers in not belonging to either group. And who does greater injustice than he who conceals hides from people a testimony he has received from God? that is there is none more unjust than him these are the Jews for they concealed God’s testimony about Abraham’s pure faith in the Torah; And God is not heedless of what you do’ this is a threat for them.
تِلْكَ أُمَّةٌ قَدْ خَلَتْ لَهَا مَا كَسَبَتْ وَلَكُمْ مَّا كَسَبْتُمْ وَلاَ تُسْأَلُونَ عَمَّا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ,That is a community that has passed away; theirs is what they have earned and yours is what you have earned; you shall not be asked about what they did a similar verse has already been mentioned above.
سَيَقُولُ ٱلسُّفَهَآءُ مِنَ ٱلنَّاسِ مَا وَلَّٰهُمْ عَن قِبْلَتِهِمُ ٱلَّتِي كَانُواْ عَلَيْهَا قُل للَّهِ ٱلْمَشْرِقُ وَٱلْمَغْرِبُ يَهْدِي مَن يَشَآءُ إِلَىٰ صِرَاطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ,The fools the ignorant among the people that is the Jews and the idolaters will say ‘What matter has turned them the Prophet s and the believers from the direction they were facing in their prayers formerly?’ this being the Holy House bayt al-maqdis sc. Jerusalem; the sīn of sa-yaqūlu ‘they will say’ denotes the future tense and informs of the Unseen. Say ‘To God belong the East and the West that is all directions. Thus He commands that they face whichever direction He wills and there can be no objection. He guides whomever He will His guidance being to a straight path’ that is the religion of Islam and you are among these guided ones.
وَكَذَلِكَ جَعَلْنَاكُمْ أُمَّةً وَسَطاً لِّتَكُونُواْ شُهَدَآءَ عَلَى ٱلنَّاسِ وَيَكُونَ ٱلرَّسُولُ عَلَيْكُمْ شَهِيداً وَمَا جَعَلْنَا ٱلْقِبْلَةَ ٱلَّتِي كُنتَ عَلَيْهَآ إِلاَّ لِنَعْلَمَ مَن يَتَّبِعُ ٱلرَّسُولَ مِمَّن يَنقَلِبُ عَلَىٰ عَقِبَيْهِ وَإِن كَانَتْ لَكَبِيرَةً إِلاَّ عَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ هَدَى ٱللَّهُ وَمَا كَانَ ٱللَّهُ لِيُضِيعَ إِيمَانَكُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ بِٱلنَّاسِ لَرَءُوفٌ رَّحِيمٌ,Thus in the same way that We guided you to it We appointed you O community of Muhammad (s) a midmost community excellent and upright that you might be witnesses to the people on the Day of Resurrection that their messengers delivered the Message to them; and that the Messenger might be a witness to you that he delivered the Message to you and We did not appoint make the direction for you now the direction you were facing that is the Ka‘ba the Prophet s used to face it in prayer but when he emigrated he was commanded to face the Holy House of Jerusalem in order to win the hearts of the Jews. He prayed in this direction for sixteen or seventeen months before he changed direction; except that We might know that it become manifest knowledge who followed the Messenger and believed in him from him who turned on his heels and returned to unbelief doubting the religion and thinking that the Prophet s was confused about this issue; and a number of them apostatised as a result of this— though it the change of direction were wa-in ‘though’ is softened and its noun apocopated originally being wa-innahā a grave thing troublesome for people save for those of them whom God has guided; but God would never cause your faith that is your prayers towards the Holy House of Jerusalem to be wasted but He will reward you for them the reason that this verse was revealed was that some had asked about the status of those that had died before the change of direction of prayer; truly God is Gentle with believing people Merciful when He does not let their deeds go to waste al-ra’fa means ‘intensity of mercy’ and is mentioned first to allow for the end rhyme of the verse with the preceding one.
قَدْ نَرَىٰ تَقَلُّبَ وَجْهِكَ فِي ٱلسَّمَآءِ فَلَنُوَلِّيَنَّكَ قِبْلَةً تَرْضَاهَا فَوَلِّ وَجْهَكَ شَطْرَ ٱلْمَسْجِدِ ٱلْحَرَامِ وَحَيْثُ مَا كُنْتُمْ فَوَلُّواْ وُجُوِهَكُمْ شَطْرَهُ وَإِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ ٱلْكِتَابَ لَيَعْلَمُونَ أَنَّهُ ٱلْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّهِمْ وَمَا ٱللَّهُ بِغَافِلٍ عَمَّا يَعْمَلُونَ,We have indeed qad ‘indeed’ is for affirmation seen you turning your face about in the direction of the heaven looking around for the Revelation and longing for the command to face the Ka‘ba he the Prophet wished for this because it was the prayer-direction of Abraham and would be more conducive to the submission of the Arabs to Islam; now We will surely turn you to a direction that shall satisfy you that you will love. Turn your face in prayer towards the Sacred Mosque that is the Ka‘ba and wherever you are addressing the Muslim community turn your faces in prayer towards it. Those who have been given the Scripture know that it the change towards the Ka‘ba is the fixed truth from their Lord on account of the description in their Scripture of how the Prophet s would re-orient himself to it; God is not heedless of what you do O believers when you obey His command alternatively ta‘malūna ‘you do’ can be read ya‘malūna ‘they do’ in other words it would be referring to the Jews’ denial of the matter concerning the direction of prayer.
وَلَئِنْ أَتَيْتَ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ ٱلْكِتَابَ بِكُلِّ آيَةٍ مَّا تَبِعُواْ قِبْلَتَكَ وَمَآ أَنتَ بِتَابِعٍ قِبْلَتَهُمْ وَمَا بَعْضُهُم بِتَابِعٍ قِبْلَةَ بَعْضٍ وَلَئِنِ ٱتَّبَعْتَ أَهْوَاءَهُم مِّن بَعْدِ مَا جَآءَكَ مِنَ ٱلْعِلْمِ إِنَّكَ إِذَاً لَّمِنَ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ,Yet if wa-la-in the lām is for oaths you should bring to those who have been given the Scripture every sign about your truthfulness in the matter of the direction of prayer they will not follow your direction out of obduracy and you are not a follower of their direction this is a categorical negation of his the Prophet’s desire that they become Muslims and of their desire that he return to their direction of prayer; neither are they the Jews and the Christians followers of one another’s direction. If you were to follow their whims the ones to which they summon you after the knowledge the revelation that has come to you then you if hypothetically you were to follow them will surely be among the evildoers.
ٱلَّذِينَ آتَيْنَاهُمُ ٱلْكِتَابَ يَعْرِفُونَهُ كَمَا يَعْرِفُونَ أَبْنَاءَهُمْ وَإِنَّ فَرِيقاً مِّنْهُمْ لَيَكْتُمُونَ ٱلْحَقَّ وَهُمْ يَعْلَمُونَ,Those to whom We have given the Scripture they recognise him Muhammad (s) as they recognise their sons because of the descriptions of him in their Scripture ‘Abd Allāh Ibn Salām said ‘I recognised him the moment I saw him as I would my own son; but my recognition of Muhammad (s) was more intense’; even though there is a party of them that conceal the truth that is his description while they know this truth which you Muhammad (s) follow.
ٱلْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّكَ فَلاَ تَكُونَنَّ مِنَ ٱلْمُمْتَرِينَ,The truth comes from your Lord; then be not among the doubters who doubt it that is to say ‘be not of such a disposition’ which is more eloquent than merely saying ‘do not waver’.
وَلِكُلٍّ وِجْهَةٌ هُوَ مُوَلِّيهَا فَٱسْتَبِقُواْ ٱلْخَيْرَاتِ أَيْنَ مَا تَكُونُواْ يَأْتِ بِكُمُ ٱللَّهُ جَمِيعاً إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,Every person of every community has his direction wijha his qibla to which he turns muwallīhā ‘he turns to it’ is also read as muwallāhā ‘he is made to turn to it’ in his prayers so vie with one another in good works strive with acts of obedience and acceptance of these. Wherever you may be God will bring you all together gathering you on the Day of Resurrection and requiting you for your deeds; surely God has power over all things.
وَمِنْ حَيْثُ خَرَجْتَ فَوَلِّ وَجْهَكَ شَطْرَ ٱلْمَسْجِدِ ٱلْحَرَامِ وَإِنَّهُ لَلْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّكَ وَمَا ٱللَّهُ بِغَافِلٍ عَمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ,From whatever place you issue on a journey turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque; it is the truth from your Lord. God is not heedless of what you do ta‘malūna ‘you do’ may also be read as ya‘malūna ‘they do’ as already appears above sc. 2144; its repetition is intended to point out that the stipulation applies equally to being on a journey or otherwise.
وَمِنْ حَيْثُ خَرَجْتَ فَوَلِّ وَجْهَكَ شَطْرَ ٱلْمَسْجِدِ ٱلْحَرَامِ وَحَيْثُ مَا كُنْتُمْ فَوَلُّواْ وُجُوهَكُمْ شَطْرَهُ لِئَلاَّ يَكُونَ لِلنَّاسِ عَلَيْكُمْ حُجَّةٌ إِلاَّ ٱلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ مِنْهُمْ فَلاَ تَخْشَوْهُمْ وَٱخْشَوْنِي وَلأُتِمَّ نِعْمَتِي عَلَيْكُمْ وَلَعَلَّكُمْ تَهْتَدُونَ,From whatever place you issue turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque; and wherever you may be turn your faces towards it all of which is being repeated for emphasis so that there be not any argument from the people the Jews or the idolaters against you so that there be not any cause for contention regarding the change to a different direction of prayer. In this way their contentions against you will cease to exist both the contentions of the Jews when they say ‘He Muhammad (s) rejects our religion but follows our direction of prayer’ and of the idolaters when they say ‘He Muhammad (s) claims to follow the creed of Abraham but he contravenes his Abraham’s qibla’; excepting the evildoers among them acting in obstinacy who will say ‘He Muhammad (s) only changed to this direction because of his natural inclination towards the idolatrous religion of his forefathers’. The exceptive statement indicated by illā is a continuous one the meaning being ‘No one will have anything to say against you except for what these people say’; and do not fear them do not fear their arguing with you regarding the change to it the Ka‘ba but fear Me by complying with My command; and that I may perfect My grace upon you by guiding you to the principal rituals of your religion and that you may be guided to the truth wa-li-utimma ‘that I may perfect’ is a supplement to li-allā yakūna ‘that there be not’.
كَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَا فِيكُمْ رَسُولاً مِّنْكُمْ يَتْلُواْ عَلَيْكُمْ آيَاتِنَا وَيُزَكِّيكُمْ وَيُعَلِّمُكُمُ ٱلْكِتَابَ وَٱلْحِكْمَةَ وَيُعَلِّمُكُم مَّا لَمْ تَكُونُواْ تَعْلَمُونَ,As also We have sent this verbal clause ka-mā arsalnā ‘as We have sent’ is semantically connected to wa-li-utimma of the previous verse that is to say ‘Also We have sent by way of perfection’; as it My grace has been perfected by Our sending among you of yourselves Muhammad (s) a messenger to recite Our verses the Qur’ān to you and to purify you to cleanse you from idolatry and to teach you the Book the Qur’ān and wisdom the rulings therein and to teach you what you knew not.
فَٱذْكُرُونِيۤ أَذْكُرْكُمْ وَٱشْكُرُواْ لِي وَلاَ تَكْفُرُونِ,So remember Me through prayer glorification and the like I will remember you this is said to mean ‘I will reward you’; in a hadīth about God that He says ‘whoever remembers Me in himself I will remember him in Myself and whoever remembers Me in an assembly I will remember him in an Assembly more excellent than his’; and be thankful to Me for My grace by being obedient and be not ungrateful towards Me through disobedience.
يَآأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ ٱسْتَعِينُواْ بِٱلصَّبْرِ وَٱلصَّلاَةِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ مَعَ ٱلصَّابِرِينَ,O you who believe seek help regarding the Hereafter through patience in obedience and afflictions and prayer He singles it out for mention on account of its frequency and its greatness; surely God is with the patient helping them.
وَلاَ تَقُولُواْ لِمَنْ يُقْتَلُ فِي سَبيلِ ٱللَّهِ أَمْوَاتٌ بَلْ أَحْيَاءٌ وَلَكِن لاَّ تَشْعُرُونَ,And say not of those slain in God’s way that ‘They are dead’; rather they are living their spirits are according to a hadīth contained in green birds that take wing freely wherever they wish in Paradise; but you are not aware but you do not know their condition.
وَلَنَبْلُوَنَّكُمْ بِشَيْءٍ مِّنَ ٱلْخَوْفِ وَٱلْجُوعِ وَنَقْصٍ مِّنَ ٱلأَمَوَالِ وَٱلأَنفُسِ وَٱلثَّمَرَاتِ وَبَشِّرِ ٱلصَّابِرِينَ,Surely We will try you with something of fear of an enemy and hunger by way of drought and diminution of goods as a result of destruction and lives as a result of slaughter death and disease and fruits by way of crop damage that is to say We will try you to see if you practise patience or not; yet give good tidings of Paradise to the patient during calamities;
ٱلَّذِينَ إِذَآ أَصَابَتْهُم مُّصِيبَةٌ قَالُواْ إِنَّا للَّهِ وَإِنَّـآ إِلَيْهِ رَاجِعُونَ,those who when they are struck by an affliction a calamity say ‘Surely we belong to God we are His possession and servants with whom He does as He pleases; and to Him we will return’ in the Hereafter whereupon He will requite us in one hadīth it is said that ‘whoever pronounces the istirjā‘ sc. the formula ‘surely we belong to God and to Him we will return’ when an affliction befalls him God will reward him and compensate him with what is better’. Similarly it is said that on one occasion when his lamp blew out the Prophet s uttered the istirjā‘ whereupon ‘Ā’isha said to him saying ‘But it is just a lamp’ to which he replied ‘Whatever bothers a believer is an affliction of sorts’ this is reported by Abū Dāwūd in his section on mursal reports.
أُولَـٰئِكَ عَلَيْهِمْ صَلَوَاتٌ مِّن رَّبِّهِمْ وَرَحْمَةٌ وَأُولَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْمُهْتَدُونَ,Upon those rest blessings forgiveness and mercy grace from their Lord and those — they are the truly guided to rectitude.
إِنَّ ٱلصَّفَا وَٱلْمَرْوَةَ مِن شَعَآئِرِ ٱللَّهِ فَمَنْ حَجَّ ٱلْبَيْتَ أَوِ ٱعْتَمَرَ فَلاَ جُنَاحَ عَلَيْهِ أَن يَطَّوَّفَ بِهِمَا وَمَن تَطَوَّعَ خَيْراً فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ شَاكِرٌ عَلِيمٌ,Truly Safā and Marwa two mountains near Mecca are among the waymarks sha‘ā’ir plural of sha‘īra of God the ritual ceremonies of His religion so whoever makes the Pilgrimage to the House or the Visitation that is whoever prepares to perform the Pilgrimage hajj or the Visitation ‘umra the original sense of both terms hajja and i‘tamara is ‘to aim for’ and ‘to visit’ respectively; he would not be at fault it would not be a sin if he circumambulates them the original tā’ of yatatawwafa ‘circumambulate’ has been assimilated with the tā’ by pacing quickly sa‘y between them seven times this was revealed when the Muslims were averse to this circumambulation because the pagan Arabs used to circumambulate them and there was an idol atop each mountain which they used to stroke. It is reported from Ibn ‘Abbās that this pacing between the two is not obligatory based on the fact that when no sin can be incurred the context implies free choice. Al-Shāfi‘ī and others however considered it to be a pillar of the Pilgrimage rituals. The Prophet made clear its obligatory aspect when he said that ‘God has prescribed for you the pacing sa‘y’ as reported by al-Bayhaqī and others; and he the Prophet also said ‘Begin with what God has begun’ meaning al-Safā as reported by Muslim; and whoever volunteers tatawwa‘a a variant reading is yattawa‘ the ta’ here being assimilated good that is any good deed such as circumambulation or other that is not obligatory on him; God is Grateful for such a deed and rewards that person for it Knowing it.
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يَكْتُمُونَ مَآ أَنزَلْنَا مِنَ ٱلْبَيِّنَاتِ وَٱلْهُدَىٰ مِن بَعْدِ مَا بَيَّنَّاهُ لِلنَّاسِ فِي ٱلْكِتَابِ أُولَـٰئِكَ يَلعَنُهُمُ ٱللَّهُ وَيَلْعَنُهُمُ ٱللاَّعِنُونَ,The following was revealed concerning the Jews Those who conceal from people the clear proofs and the guidance that We have revealed such as the ‘stoning’ verse and the description of Muhammad (s) after We have shown them clearly in the Scripture the Torah — they shall be cursed by God that is He will move them far away from His mercy and by the cursers the angels believers or by every single thing when they supplicate that they be cursed.
إِلاَّ ٱلَّذِينَ تَابُواْ وَأَصْلَحُواْ وَبَيَّنُواْ فَأُوْلَـئِكَ أَتُوبُ عَلَيْهِمْ وَأَنَا التَّوَّابُ الرَّحِيمُ,Except those that repent turning back from such deeds and make amends in their actions and show clearly what they were concealing — them I shall turn relenting accepting their repentance; I am the Relenting the Merciful to believers.
إِن الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا وَمَاتُوا وَهُمْ كُفَّارٌ أُولَئِكَ عَلَيْهِمْ لَعْنَةُ ٱللَّهِ وَٱلْمَلاۤئِكَةِ وَٱلنَّاسِ أَجْمَعِينَ,But those who disbelieve and die disbelieving wa-hum kuffār ‘they being disbelievers’ is a circumstantial qualifier — upon them shall be the curse of God and the angels and of people altogether that is they deserve such a curse in this life and in the next; ‘people’ here is said to be either people in general or believers.
خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا لاَ يُخَفَّفُ عَنْهُمُ ٱلْعَذَابُ وَلاَ هُمْ يُنْظَرُونَ,Abiding therein that is in the curse and the Fire the latter indicated by the following words the chastisement shall not be lightened for them not even for a blink of an eye no respite shall be given them in which to have time to repent or to excuse themselves.
وَإِلَـٰهُكُمْ إِلَـٰهٌ وَاحِدٌ لاَّ إِلَـٰهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ ٱلرَّحْمَـٰنُ ٱلرَّحِيمُ,When they asked him Muhammad (s) to describe his Lord the following was revealed Your God the One deserving of your worship is One God without any equal in either essence or attribute; there is no god except Him He is the Compassionate the Merciful.
إِنَّ فِي خَلْقِ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَٱخْتِلاَفِ ٱللَّيْلِ وَٱلنَّهَارِ وَٱلْفُلْكِ ٱلَّتِي تَجْرِي فِي ٱلْبَحْرِ بِمَا يَنفَعُ ٱلنَّاسَ وَمَآ أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مِن مَّآءٍ فَأَحْيَا بِهِ ٱلأَرْضَ بَعْدَ مَوْتِهَا وَبَثَّ فِيهَا مِن كُلِّ دَآبَّةٍ وَتَصْرِيفِ ٱلرِّيَاحِ وَٱلسَّحَابِ ٱلْمُسَخَّرِ بَيْنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ وَٱلأَرْضِ لآيَاتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يَعْقِلُونَ,They then asked for a sign to prove this and the following was revealed Surely in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the marvels contained in them and the alternation of the night and day passing and returning increasing and diminishing and the ships that run in the sea and do not become cracked and sink with what profits men of trade and merchandise and the water the rain God sends down from the heaven with which He revives the earth with vegetation after it is dead after it has dried out and He scatters abroad in it all manner of crawling thing by dividing them and spreading them throughout on account of the vegetation for they thrive on the fertile pastures it produces; and the disposition of the winds changing it from south to north from cold to warm and the clouds compelled subjugated by God’s command moving to wherever God wishes between heaven and the earth without being attached to either of the two — surely there are signs indicating His Oneness exalted be He for a people who comprehend a people who contemplate.
وَمِنَ ٱلنَّاسِ مَن يَتَّخِذُ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ أَندَاداً يُحِبُّونَهُمْ كَحُبِّ ٱللَّهِ وَٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ أَشَدُّ حُبّاً للَّهِ وَلَوْ يَرَى ٱلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوۤاْ إِذْ يَرَوْنَ ٱلْعَذَابَ أَنَّ ٱلْقُوَّةَ للَّهِ جَمِيعاً وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ شَدِيدُ ٱلْعَذَابِ,Yet there be people who take to themselves compeers idols besides God that is other than God loving them by magnifying them and being subservient to them as God is loved that is as their love of Him; but those who believe love God more ardently than those who love their compeers because the former never reject God whereas the latter when faced with hardship soon abandon those compeers for God; If he if you O Muhammad (s) were to see those who did evil by taking to themselves compeers when idh here denotes idhā they see read either as active yarawna ‘they see’ or passive yurawna ‘they are made to see’ the chastisement you would see a grave sight that this is because the might the power and the vanquishing altogether a circumstantial qualifier belongs to God and that God is terrible in chastisement according to one reading the person listening to the verse governs the verb yarā ‘he sees’ and constitutes the subject of the clause; according to another reading it is the ‘evildoers’ who constitute the subject of the clause and govern the verb yarā; and so it yarā has the sense of ya‘lam ‘he knows’; the particle an ‘that’ and what comes after it have taken the place of the objects in both cases; the response to the initial conditional law ‘if’ has been omitted. The general meaning of the verse then is ‘If they were aware in this world of the severity of God’s chastisement and of the fact that power is God’s alone the moment they come to see it with their own eyes on the Day of Resurrection they would not take to themselves compeers’.
إِذْ تَبَرَّأَ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱتُّبِعُواْ مِنَ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱتَّبَعُواْ وَرَأَوُاْ ٱلْعَذَابَ وَتَقَطَّعَتْ بِهِمُ ٱلأَسْبَابُ,When idh here substitutes for the previous idh those who were followed that is the leaders disown their followers that is to say when they have denied misleading them the latter and they have seen the chastisement and the cords the bonds of affection and kinship that were between them on earth are cut away before them from them taqatta‘at ‘cut away’ is a supplement to tabarra’a ‘disown’.
وَقَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱتَّبَعُواْ لَوْ أَنَّ لَنَا كَرَّةً فَنَتَبَرَّأَ مِنْهُمْ كَمَا تَبَرَّءُواْ مِنَّا كَذَلِكَ يُرِيهِمُ ٱللَّهُ أَعْمَالَهُمْ حَسَرَاتٍ عَلَيْهِمْ وَمَا هُم بِخَارِجِينَ مِنَ ٱلنَّارِ,And those who followed say ‘O if only we might return again to the world and disown them the ones who had been followed as they have disowned us!’ on this day the particle law ‘if only’ is an optative and its response is natabarra’a ‘we disown’. So just as He showed them the severity of His chastisement and their disowning of one another so too God shall show them their evil works as anguish hasarāt is a circumstantial qualifier regrets for them! Never shall they exit from the Fire once they have entered it.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّاسُ كُلُواْ مِمَّا فِي ٱلأَرْضِ حَلاَلاً طَيِّباً وَلاَ تَتَّبِعُواْ خُطُوَاتِ ٱلشَّيْطَانِ إِنَّهُ لَكُمْ عَدُوٌّ مُّبِينٌ,The following was revealed when some said that it was unlawful to take a camel that has been let loose sawā’ib O people eat of what is in the earth lawful halālan is a circumstantial qualifier and wholesome tayyiban is an adjective for emphasis that is to say what is delicious; and follow not the steps the ways of Satan meaning what he embellishes of temptations; he is a manifest foe to you whose enmity is clear;
إِنَّمَا يَأْمُرُكُمْ بِٱلسُّوۤءِ وَٱلْفَحْشَآءِ وَأَن تَقُولُواْ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ مَا لاَ تَعْلَمُونَ,he only commands you to evil sin and indecency what is abhorred by the Law and that you should speak against God what you do not know such as forbidding what He has not forbidden and otherwise.
وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمُ ٱتَّبِعُوا مَآ أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ قَالُواْ بَلْ نَتَّبِعُ مَآ أَلْفَيْنَا عَلَيْهِ آبَآءَنَآ أَوَلَوْ كَانَ آبَاؤُهُمْ لاَ يَعْقِلُونَ شَيْئاً وَلاَ يَهْتَدُونَ,And when it is said to them the disbelievers ‘Follow what God has revealed’ pertaining to affirmation of God’s Oneness and the good things that He has made lawful they say ‘No; but we follow what we found our fathers doing’ in the way of idol-worship deeming unlawful the camel let loose and practising the slitting of the camel’s ear sc. bahīra. God says What? the hamza of a-wa-law is for repudiation do they follow them Even if their fathers do not understand anything concerning religion and they were not guided? to the truth.
وَمَثَلُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ كَمَثَلِ ٱلَّذِي يَنْعِقُ بِمَا لاَ يَسْمَعُ إِلاَّ دُعَآءً وَنِدَآءً صُمٌّ بُكْمٌ عُمْيٌ فَهُمْ لاَ يَعْقِلُونَ,The likeness the attribute of those who disbelieve and the one who calls them to guidance is as the likeness of one who shouts to that which hears nothing save a call and a cry only a sound not understanding its meaning when they listen to an admonition they are like cattle that hear the cry of their shepherd but do not understand what he is saying; they are deaf dumb blind — they do not comprehend any admonition.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ كُلُواْ مِن طَيِّبَاتِ مَا رَزَقْنَاكُمْ وَٱشْكُرُواْ للَّهِ إِن كُنْتُمْ إِيَّاهُ تَعْبُدُونَ,O you who believe eat of the good things that are lawful wherewith We have provided you and give thanks to God for what He has made lawful for you if it be Him that you worship.
إِنَّمَا حَرَّمَ عَلَيْكُمُ ٱلْمَيْتَةَ وَٱلدَّمَ وَلَحْمَ ٱلْخِنزِيرِ وَمَآ أُهِلَّ بِهِ لِغَيْرِ ٱللَّهِ فَمَنِ ٱضْطُرَّ غَيْرَ بَاغٍ وَلاَ عَادٍ فَلاۤ إِثْمَ عَلَيْهِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,He has only forbidden you carrion that is the consumption of it since this is the subject of the general address here and similarly the consumption of what follows all of which is what has not been slaughtered in accordance with prescriptions of the Law; to this the Sunna adds as also constituting carrion what has been severed from a living creature. A special status is however accorded fish and locusts; blood poured forth as in sūrat al-An‘ām see Q. 6145 the flesh of swine the meat is singled out for mention because that part is what people mostly seek every other part being implied thereby; what has been hallowed to other than God that is to say what has been slaughtered in other than His Name al-ihlāl is the raising of one’s voice which they used to do when sacrificing for their gods. Yet whoever is constrained forced by dire need to eat of the above-mentioned not desiring to rebel against Muslims nor transgressing committing aggression against them by waylaying them no sin shall be on him for eating it. God is Forgiving to His friends Merciful to those who are obedient to Him for He has granted them wide berth in this matter. The aggressor and the transgressor are excluded from this dispensation and to these two categories one should also add every person that sets out on a journey in disobedience such as the fugitive or the excise collector for whom it would be unlawful to eat any of the mentioned unless they repent of their disobedience; this is the opinion of al-Shāfi‘ī.
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يَكْتُمُونَ مَآ أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ مِنَ ٱلْكِتَابِ وَيَشْتَرُونَ بِهِ ثَمَناً قَلِيلاً أُولَـٰئِكَ مَا يَأْكُلُونَ فِي بُطُونِهِمْ إِلاَّ ٱلنَّارَ وَلاَ يُكَلِّمُهُمُ ٱللَّهُ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ وَلاَ يُزَكِّيهِمْ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,Those who conceal what God has revealed of the Scripture comprising all the descriptions of Muhammad (s) meaning the Jews and sell it for a little price in this world taking this little price in its place from the debased ones among them for fear of losing out if they were to manifest it sc. the truth of Muhammad (s) — they shall consume nothing in their bellies but the Fire because that is their journey’s end; God shall not speak to them on the Day of Resurrection out of anger with them neither purify them from the filth of sin; and theirs is a painful chastisement that is the Fire.
أُولَـٰئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱشْتَرَوُاْ ٱلضَّلاَلَةَ بِٱلْهُدَىٰ وَٱلْعَذَابَ بِٱلْمَغْفِرَةِ فَمَآ أَصْبَرَهُمْ عَلَى ٱلنَّارِ,Those are they that have bought error at the price of guidance taking the former in place of the latter in this world and chastisement at the price of pardon the pardon that would have been prepared for them in the Hereafter had they not concealed this matter; what makes them so patient for the Fire? that is how great is the extent of their patience? This statement is intended to provoke amazement in the believers at the way in which they the disbelievers commit sins that necessitate their punishment in the Fire with complete indifference. In reality they would have no patience whatever to endure the Fire.
ذَلِكَ بِأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ نَزَّلَ ٱلْكِتَابَ بِٱلْحَقِّ وَإِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱخْتَلَفُواْ فِي ٱلْكِتَابِ لَفِي شِقَاقٍ بَعِيدٍ,That which has been mentioned of their eating of the Fire and what follows it is because God has revealed the Book with the truth but they are at variance regarding it believing in parts of it while disbelieving in others and concealing them; and those that are at variance regarding the Book concerning this matter namely the Jews — although it is said that these are the idolaters some of whom said with regard to the Qur’ān that it was poetry others that it was sorcery and others still that it was divination — are in schism disagreement far removed from the truth.
لَّيْسَ ٱلْبِرَّ أَن تُوَلُّواْ وُجُوهَكُمْ قِبَلَ ٱلْمَشْرِقِ وَٱلْمَغْرِبِ وَلَـٰكِنَّ ٱلْبِرَّ مَنْ آمَنَ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلآخِرِ وَٱلْمَلاۤئِكَةِ وَٱلْكِتَابِ وَٱلنَّبِيِّينَ وَآتَى ٱلْمَالَ عَلَىٰ حُبِّهِ ذَوِي ٱلْقُرْبَىٰ وَٱلْيَتَامَىٰ وَٱلْمَسَاكِينَ وَٱبْنَ ٱلسَّبِيلِ وَٱلسَّآئِلِينَ وَفِي ٱلرِّقَابِ وَأَقَامَ ٱلصَّلاةَ وَآتَى ٱلزَّكَاةَ وَٱلْمُوفُونَ بِعَهْدِهِمْ إِذَا عَاهَدُواْ وَٱلصَّابِرِينَ فِي ٱلْبَأْسَآءِ وٱلضَّرَّآءِ وَحِينَ ٱلْبَأْسِ أُولَـٰئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ صَدَقُواْ وَأُولَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْمُتَّقُونَ,It is not piety that you turn your faces in prayer to the East and to the West. This was revealed in response to the claim made by the Jews and the Christians to this effect. True piety that is the pious person al-birr is also read al-barr in the sense of al-bārr ‘the dutiful person’ is that of the one who believes in God and the Last Day and the angels and the Book that is the scriptures and the prophets and who gives of his substance however despite it being cherished by him to kinsmen and orphans and the needy and the traveller and beggars and for the setting free of slaves both the captive and the one to be manumitted by contract; and who observes prayer and pays the alms that are obligatory and what was given before alms were made obligatory in the way of charity; and those who fulfil their covenant when they have engaged in a covenant with God or with others those who endure with fortitude al-sābirīna is the accusative of laudation misfortune al-ba’sā’ is abject poverty hardship illness and peril at the height of a battle in the way of God; these described in the way mentioned are the ones who are truthful in their faith and in their claims to piety and these are the ones who are fearful of God.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ كُتِبَ عَلَيْكُمُ ٱلْقِصَاصُ فِي ٱلْقَتْلَى ٱلْحُرُّ بِالْحُرِّ وَٱلْعَبْدُ بِٱلْعَبْدِ وَٱلأُنثَىٰ بِٱلأُنْثَىٰ فَمَنْ عُفِيَ لَهُ مِنْ أَخِيهِ شَيْءٌ فَٱتِّبَاعٌ بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ وَأَدَآءٌ إِلَيْهِ بِإِحْسَانٍ ذٰلِكَ تَخْفِيفٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَرَحْمَةٌ فَمَنِ ٱعْتَدَىٰ بَعْدَ ذٰلِكَ فَلَهُ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,O you who believe prescribed made obligatory for you is retaliation on equal terms regarding the slain both in the attributes of the one slain and in the action involved; a free man is killed for a free man and not for a slave; and a slave for a slave and a female for a female. The Sunna makes it clear that a male may be killed in retaliation for a female and that religious affiliation should be taken into account also so that a Muslim cannot be killed in return for an disbeliever even if the former be a slave and the latter a free man. But if anything of the blood is pardoned any one of those who have slain in relation to his brother the one slain so that the retaliation is waived the use of the indefinite shay’un ‘anything’ here implies the waiving of retaliation through a partial pardon by the inheritors of the slain; the mention of akhīh ‘his brother’ is intended as a conciliatory entreaty to pardon and a declaration that killing should not sever the bonds of religious brotherhood; the particle man ‘any one’ is the subject of a conditional or a relative clause of which the predicate is the following fa’ittibā‘un let the pursuing that is the action of the one who has pardoned in pursuing the killer be honourable demanding the blood money without force. The fact that the ‘pursuing’ results from the ‘pardoning’ implies that one of the two actions is a duty which is one of al-Shāfi‘ī’s two opinions here. The other opinion is that retaliation is the duty whereas the blood money is merely compensation for non-retaliation so that if one were to pardon but not name his blood money then nothing happens; and this latter is the preferred opinion. And let the payment of the blood money by the slayer to him the pardoner that is the one inheriting from the slain be with kindliness without procrastination or fraud; that stipulation mentioned here about the possibility of retaliation and the forgoing of this in return for blood money is an alleviation a facilitation given to you by your Lord and a mercy for you for He has given you latitude in this matter and has not categorically demanded that one of the said options be followed through in the way that He made it obligatory for Jews to retaliate and for Christians to pardon and accept blood money; and for him who commits aggression by being unjust towards the killer and slaying him after that that is after pardoning — his is a painful chastisement of the Fire in the Hereafter or of being killed in this world.
وَلَكُمْ فِي ٱلْقِصَاصِ حَيَٰوةٌ يٰأُولِي ٱلأَلْبَابِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ,In retaliation there is life for you that is great longevity O people of pith possessors of intellect because if the would-be killer knew that he would be killed in retaliation he would refrain from such action and would have thereby given life to himself and to the one whom he had intended to kill; and so it retaliation was stipulated by the Law so that you might fear killing fearing retaliation.
كُتِبَ عَلَيْكُمْ إِذَا حَضَرَ أَحَدَكُمُ ٱلْمَوْتُ إِن تَرَكَ خَيْراً ٱلْوَصِيَّةُ لِلْوَالِدَيْنِ وَٱلأَقْرَبِينَ بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ حَقّاً عَلَى ٱلْمُتَّقِينَ,Prescribed made obligatory for you when any of you is approached by death that is by its causes and leaves behind some good material possessions is to make testament al-wasiyyatu is in the nominative because of kutiba and is semantically connected to the particle idhā ‘when’ if the latter is adverbial; but if this latter is conditional then it al-wasiyyatu indicates the response; the response to the conditional particle in ‘if’ is in other words implied to be fa’l-yūsi ‘let him make testament’; in favour of his parents and kinsmen honourably that is justly not giving more than the allotted share of a third nor preferring the richer person — an obligation haqqan here emphasises the import of what has preceded on those that fear God this verse has been abrogated by the ‘inheritance’ verse āyat al-mīrāth see Q. 411 and by the hadīth ‘Do not make testament for one already inheriting’ as reported by al-Tirmidhī.
فَمَن بَدَّلَهُ بَعْدَ مَا سَمِعَهُ فَإِنَّمَا إِثْمُهُ عَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ يُبَدِّلُونَهُ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ,Then if anyone whether a witness or a trustee changes it that is the testament after hearing it and knowing it the sin resulting from the changed testament shall rest upon those who change it here the explicit subject stands in place of the implicit one; surely God is Hearing of the testator’s words Knowing of the deeds of the trustee requiting each accordingly.
فَمَنْ خَافَ مِن مُّوصٍ جَنَفاً أَوْ إِثْماً فَأَصْلَحَ بَيْنَهُمْ فَلاَ إِثْمَ عَلَيْهِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,But if any one fears injustice an error in straying from what is right or sin because he has purposely increased the share of a third or specified a rich individual from one making testament read mūsī or muwassī and so makes things right between them the testator and the trustee by commanding that justice be done then no sin shall be upon him with regard to this matter; surely God is Forgiving Merciful.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ كُتِبَ عَلَيْكُمُ ٱلصِّيَامُ كَمَا كُتِبَ عَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ,O you who believe prescribed for you obligatory for you is the Fast just as it was prescribed for those communities that were before you so that you might guard yourselves against acts of disobedience for it the fast curbs the desires that prompt these acts.
أَيَّاماً مَّعْدُودَاتٍ فَمَن كَانَ مِنكُم مَّرِيضاً أَوْ عَلَىٰ سَفَرٍ فَعِدَّةٌ مِّنْ أَيَّامٍ أُخَرَ وَعَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ يُطِيقُونَهُ فِدْيَةٌ طَعَامُ مِسْكِينٍ فَمَن تَطَوَّعَ خَيْراً فَهُوَ خَيْرٌ لَّهُ وَأَن تَصُومُواْ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ إِن كُنْتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ,For days ayyāman ‘days’ is in the accusative as the object of al-siyām ‘the fast’ or of an implied yasūmū ‘he fasts’ numbered few or specific in number that is those of Ramadān as will be mentioned below; God has specified a small number as a way of facilitating matters for those under the obligation; and if any of you during the month be sick or be on a journey in which prayers are shortened or if one is strained by the fast in both cases and breaks it then a number of other days equal to the ones during which he broke his fast — let him fast them instead; and for those who are not able to do it to fast on account of old age or chronic illness a redemption which is the feeding of a poor man with about the same amount one consumes in a given day that is one mudd measure of the principal food of that town each day a variant reading has genitive fidyatin as an explicative clause. It is also said that the lā negation of the verb yutīqūnahu is not actually implied because at the very beginning of Islam they could choose between fasting or offering the redemption; but later on this was abrogated by fixing the Fast as an obligation where God says So let those of you who are present at the month fast it Q. 2185 Ibn ‘Abbās said by way of qualification ‘Except for the pregnant one and the one breastfeeding if they break their fast out of concern for the child; in the case of these two the verse remains valid and has not been abrogated’. For him who volunteers good by offering more than the minimum amount mentioned for the redemption; that volunteering is good for him; but that you should fast wa-an tasūmū is the subject is better for you khayrun lakum is its predicate than breaking the fast and paying the redemption if you but knew that this is better for you then do it.
شَهْرُ رَمَضَانَ ٱلَّذِيۤ أُنْزِلَ فِيهِ ٱلْقُرْآنُ هُدًى لِّلنَّاسِ وَبَيِّنَاتٍ مِّنَ ٱلْهُدَىٰ وَٱلْفُرْقَانِ فَمَن شَهِدَ مِنكُمُ ٱلشَّهْرَ فَلْيَصُمْهُ وَمَن كَانَ مَرِيضاً أَوْ عَلَىٰ سَفَرٍ فَعِدَّةٌ مِّنْ أَيَّامٍ أُخَرَ يُرِيدُ ٱللَّهُ بِكُمُ ٱلْيُسْرَ وَلاَ يُرِيدُ بِكُمُ ٱلْعُسْرَ وَلِتُكْمِلُواْ ٱلْعِدَّةَ وَلِتُكَبِّرُواْ ٱللَّهَ عَلَىٰ مَا هَدَاكُمْ وَلَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ,These days of the month of Ramadān wherein the Qur’ān was revealed from the Preserved Tablet to the earthly heaven on the Night of Ordainment laylat al-qadr from Him a guidance hudan ‘a guidance’ is a circumstantial qualifier guiding away from error for the people and as clear proofs lucid verses of the Guidance the rulings that guide to truth and of the Criterion that discriminates between truth and falsehood; So let those of you who are present at the month fast it and if any of you be sick or if he be on a journey then a number of other days this concession has already been mentioned but it is repeated here to avoid the mistaken impression that it has been abrogated by the comprehensive implication of man shahida ‘who are present’. God desires ease for you and desires not hardship for you and for this reason He has permitted you the breaking of the fast during illness or travel this ease being the very reason He has commanded you to fast; He supplements the previous statement with and that you fulfil read tukmilū or tukammilū the number of the fasting days of Ramadān and magnify God when you have completed them for having guided you for having directed you to the principal rites of His religion and that you might be thankful to God for this.
وَإِذَا سَأَلَكَ عِبَادِي عَنِّي فَإِنِّي قَرِيبٌ أُجِيبُ دَعْوَةَ ٱلدَّاعِ إِذَا دَعَانِ فَلْيَسْتَجِيبُواْ لِي وَلْيُؤْمِنُواْ بِي لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْشُدُونَ,A group of followers of the Prophet s asked him ‘Is our Lord nearby so that we should talk to Him secretly or is He far away so that we should call out to him?’ and the following was revealed And when My servants question you concerning Me — I am near to them in My knowledge and he informed them of this; I answer the call of the caller by granting him his request when he calls to Me; so let them respond to Me My call to them to be obedient and let them believe let them persevere in faith in Me that they might go aright that they might become guided.
أُحِلَّ لَكُمْ لَيْلَةَ ٱلصِّيَامِ ٱلرَّفَثُ إِلَىٰ نِسَآئِكُمْ هُنَّ لِبَاسٌ لَّكُمْ وَأَنْتُمْ لِبَاسٌ لَّهُنَّ عَلِمَ ٱللَّهُ أَنَّكُمْ كُنتُمْ تَخْتانُونَ أَنْفُسَكُمْ فَتَابَ عَلَيْكُمْ وَعَفَا عَنْكُمْ فَٱلآنَ بَٰشِرُوهُنَّ وَٱبْتَغُواْ مَا كَتَبَ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمْ وَكُلُواْ وَٱشْرَبُواْ حَتَّىٰ يَتَبَيَّنَ لَكُمُ ٱلْخَيْطُ ٱلأَبْيَضُ مِنَ ٱلْخَيْطِ ٱلأَسْوَدِ مِنَ ٱلْفَجْرِ ثُمَّ أَتِمُّواْ ٱلصِّيَامَ إِلَى ٱلَّليْلِ وَلاَ تُبَٰشِرُوهُنَّ وَأَنْتُمْ عَٰكِفُونَ فِي ٱلْمَسَٰجِدِ تِلْكَ حُدُودُ ٱللَّهِ فَلاَ تَقْرَبُوهَا كَذٰلِكَ يُبَيِّنُ ٱللَّهُ ءَايَٰتِهِ لِلنَّاسِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَّقُونَ,Permitted to you upon the night of the Fast is to go in to your wives in sexual intercourse this was revealed as an abrogation of its unlawfulness during the earliest phase of Islam as well as an abrogation of the unlawfulness of eating and drinking after the night prayer; they are a vestment for you and you are a vestment for them a metaphor for their embraces or their need for one another; God knows that you have been betraying yourselves by having sexual intercourse on the eve of the fast this happened with ‘Umar b. al-Khattāb and others and they apologised to the Prophet s and so He has turned to you relenting before you even turned in repentance and He has pardoned you. So now when it is permitted to you lie with them in sexual intercourse and seek what God has prescribed for you of sexual intercourse or what it produces of offspring; and eat and drink at any time during the night until the white thread is distinct to you from the black thread at daybreak that is the true moment of daybreak which explains the white thread while the explanation of the black thread namely the night has been left out. The whiteness and the darkness of the dawn twilight are likened to two black and white threads in the way they stretch out; then complete the fast from daybreak to the night that is until it arrives after the setting of the sun; and do not lie with them your women while you cleave to the mosques in devotion to God while you are residing therein with the intention of performing i‘tikāf ‘spiritual retreat’. This was a prohibition pertaining to one who used to leave the mosque whilst in a state of i‘tikāf have sexual intercourse with his wife and then return. Those rulings mentioned are God’s bounds delimited by God for His servants so that they do not overstep them; do not approach them lā taqrabūhā is more intense than lā ta‘taddūhā ‘Do not overstep’ used in verses elsewhere. So just as He makes clear to you what has been mentioned God makes clear His signs to people so that they might fear disobeying His prohibitions.
وَلاَ تَأْكُلُوۤاْ أَمْوَالَكُمْ بَيْنَكُمْ بِٱلْبَاطِلِ وَتُدْلُواْ بِهَا إِلَى ٱلْحُكَّامِ لِتَأْكُلُواْ فَرِيقاً مِّنْ أَمْوَالِ ٱلنَّاسِ بِٱلإِثْمِ وَأَنْتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ,Consume not your goods between you that is to say do not let one consume the goods of the other in deception that which is illicit according to the Law such as theft and extortion; and do not proffer them the regulation of these goods or any bribes to the judges that you may consume as a result of any arbitration a portion of other people’s goods embroiled in sin while you are aware that you are in error.
يَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ ٱلأَهِلَّةِ قُلْ هِيَ مَوَاقِيتُ لِلنَّاسِ وَٱلْحَجِّ وَلَيْسَ ٱلْبِرُّ بِأَن تَأْتُواْ ٱلْبُيُوتَ مِن ظُهُورِهَا وَلَـٰكِنَّ ٱلْبِرَّ مَنِ ٱتَّقَىٰ وَأْتُواْ ٱلْبُيُوتَ مِنْ أَبْوَابِهَا وَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ,They will ask you O Muhammad (s) about the new moons ahilla plural of hilāl ‘Why do they seem very thin and then wax until they are full of light and then wane again as at the first and are not always the same in the way that the sun is?’ Say to them ‘They are appointed times mawāqīt is the plural of mīqāt for the people for them to know the times for sowing the land for business for their women’s waiting periods their fast and their breaking it and the Pilgrimage’ wa’l-hajji and the Pilgrimage’ is a supplement to li’l-nāsi ‘for the people’ that is to say appointed times by which its season is known for if they the new moons always looked the same none of these things could be known. It is not piety to come to the houses from their backs in your state of pilgrimage inviolability ihrām when you would bore holes in them to enter them and then exit disregarding their doors; they used to do this and claim that it was out of piety; but piety is to fear God by not contravening His commands; so come to the houses by their doors when in a state of pilgrimage inviolability and fear God that you may prosper that you may triumph.
وَقَاتِلُواْ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلَّذِينَ يُقَاتِلُونَكُمْ وَلاَ تَعْتَدُوۤاْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لاَ يُحِبُّ ٱلْمُعْتَدِينَ,After the Prophet s was prevented from visiting the House in the year of the battle of Hudaybiyya he made a pact with the disbelievers that he would be allowed to return the following year at which time they would vacate Mecca for three days. Having prepared to depart for the Visitation ‘umra he and the believers were concerned that Quraysh would not keep to the agreement and instigate fighting. The Muslims were averse to becoming engaged in fighting while in a state of pilgrimage inviolability in the Sacred Enclosure al-haram and during the sacred months and so the following was revealed And fight in the way of God to elevate His religion with those who fight against you the disbelievers but aggress not against them by initiating the fighting; God loves not the aggressors the ones that overstep the bounds which God has set for them this stipulation was abrogated by the verse of barā’a ‘immunity’ Q. 91 or by His saying below
وَٱقْتُلُوهُمْ حَيْثُ ثَقِفْتُمُوهُم وَأَخْرِجُوهُمْ مِّنْ حَيْثُ أَخْرَجُوكُمْ وَٱلْفِتْنَةُ أَشَدُّ مِنَ ٱلْقَتْلِ وَلاَ تُقَاتِلُوهُمْ عِنْدَ ٱلْمَسْجِدِ ٱلْحَرَامِ حَتَّىٰ يُقَاتِلُوكُمْ فِيهِ فَإِن قَاتَلُوكُمْ فَٱقْتُلُوهُمْ كَذَلِكَ جَزَآءُ ٱلْكَافِرِينَ,And slay them wherever you come upon them and expel them from where they expelled you that is from Mecca and this was done after the Conquest of Mecca; sedition their idolatry is more grievous more serious than slaying them in the Sacred Enclosure or while in a state of pilgrimage inviolability the thing that you greatly feared. But fight them not by the Sacred Mosque that is in the Sacred Enclosure until they should fight you there; then if they fight you there slay them there a variant reading drops the alif in the three verbs sc. wa-lā taqtilūhum hattā yaqtulūkum fa-in qatalūkum so that the sense is ‘slaying’ in all three and not just ‘fighting’ — such killing and expulsion is the requital of disbelievers.
فَإِنِ ٱنتَهَوْاْ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,But if they desist from unbelief and become Muslims surely God is Forgiving Merciful to them.
وَقَاتِلُوهُمْ حَتَّىٰ لاَ تَكُونَ فِتْنَةٌ وَيَكُونَ ٱلدِّينُ للَّهِ فَإِنِ ٱنْتَهَواْ فَلاَ عُدْوَانَ إِلاَّ عَلَى ٱلظَّالِمِينَ,Fight them till there is no sedition no idolatry and the religion all worship is for God alone and none are worshipped apart from Him; then if they desist from idolatry do not aggress against them. This is indicated by the following words there shall be no enmity no aggression through slaying or otherwise save against evildoers. Those that desist however are not evildoers and should not be shown any enmity.
ٱلشَّهْرُ ٱلْحَرَامُ بِٱلشَّهْرِ ٱلْحَرَامِ وَٱلْحُرُمَاتُ قِصَاصٌ فَمَنِ ٱعْتَدَىٰ عَلَيْكُمْ فَٱعْتَدُواْ عَلَيْهِ بِمِثْلِ مَا ٱعْتَدَىٰ عَلَيْكُمْ وَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَٱعْلَمُواْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ مَعَ ٱلْمُتَّقِينَ,The sacred month in return for the sacred month therefore just as they fight you during it kill them during it a response to the Muslims’ consideration of the momentous nature of this matter; holy things hurumāt plural of hurma is what must be treated as sacrosanct demand retaliation in kind if these holy things are violated; whoever commits aggression against you through fighting in the Sacred Enclosure or during a state of ritual purity or in the sacred months then commit aggression against him in the manner that he committed against you the Muslim response is also referred to as ‘aggression’ because that is what it resembles formally; and fear God when avenging yourselves and by renouncing aggression and know that God is with the God-fearing helping and assisting them.
وَأَنْفِقُواْ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ وَلاَ تُلْقُواْ بِأَيْدِيكُمْ إِلَى ٱلتَّهْلُكَةِ وَأَحْسِنُوۤاْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُحِبُّ ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,And spend in the way of God in obedience to Him in holy struggle and the like; and cast not your own hands yourselves the bā’ of bi-aydīkum ‘with your hands’ is extra into destruction by withholding funds needed for the struggle or abandoning it altogether because this will give your enemy the advantage over you; but be virtuous by spending etc.; God loves the virtuous that is He rewards them.
وَأَتِمُّواْ ٱلْحَجَّ وَٱلْعُمْرَةَ للَّهِ فَإِنْ أُحْصِرْتُمْ فَمَا ٱسْتَيْسَرَ مِنَ ٱلْهَدْيِ وَلاَ تَحْلِقُواْ رُؤُوسَكُمْ حَتَّىٰ يَبْلُغَ ٱلْهَدْيُ مَحِلَّهُ فَمَن كَانَ مِنكُم مَّرِيضاً أَوْ بِهِ أَذًى مِّن رَّأْسِهِ فَفِدْيَةٌ مِّن صِيَامٍ أَوْ صَدَقَةٍ أَوْ نُسُكٍ فَإِذَآ أَمِنتُمْ فَمَن تَمَتَّعَ بِٱلْعُمْرَةِ إِلَى ٱلْحَجِّ فَمَا ٱسْتَيْسَرَ مِنَ ٱلْهَدْيِ فَمَن لَّمْ يَجِدْ فَصِيَامُ ثَلاثَةِ أَيَّامٍ فِي ٱلْحَجِّ وَسَبْعَةٍ إِذَا رَجَعْتُمْ تِلْكَ عَشَرَةٌ كَامِلَةٌ ذٰلِكَ لِمَن لَّمْ يَكُنْ أَهْلُهُ حَاضِرِي ٱلْمَسْجِدِ ٱلْحَرَامِ وَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَٱعْلَمُواْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ شَدِيدُ ٱلْعِقَابِ,Fulfil the Pilgrimage and the Visitation to God by completing them according to their due; but if you are prevented from fulfilling them by an enemy then give such offering as may be feasible for you — a sheep — and do not shave your heads that is do not release yourselves from the state of pilgrimage inviolability until the offering mentioned reaches its place its place of sacrifice that is within the enclosure according to al-Shāfi‘ī; the sacrifice is then made with the intention of releasing oneself from the state of pilgrimage inviolability and is divided among the needy after which the head is shaved and the release is effected. If any of you is sick or has an ailment of the head such as lice or severe pains and has thus shaved his head while in a state of pilgrimage inviolability then incumbent upon him is a redemption by fast for three days or a voluntary almsgiving consisting of three cubic measures of the principal food of the town for six needy persons or a ritual sacrifice that is the slaughter of a sheep aw ‘or’ denotes freedom of choice. To this last has been added the case of the one who shaves his head without excuse because the requirement of redemption is most obvious in his case; but also it is required in the case of one that enjoys without shaving such things as scents attire or oils be it with an excuse or without. When you are secure knowing that the enemy has gone or is not present then whoever enjoys the Visitation having completed it and observed its ritual prohibitions until the Pilgrimage until he enters its ritual inviolability in the relevant months; let his offering be such as is feasible for him such as a sheep that he sacrifices after entering into the state of pilgrimage inviolability ideally on the Day of Sacrifice; or if he finds none because there are none available or because he does not have sufficient funds then incumbent upon him is a fast of three days in the Pilgrimage that is to say in a state of pilgrimage inviolability. In such a case he should enter into the state of pilgrimage inviolability before the seventh of Dhū’l-Hijja but ideally before the sixth because one is discouraged from fasting on the Day of ‘Arafa.
ٱلْحَجُّ أَشْهُرٌ مَّعْلُومَاتٌ فَمَن فَرَضَ فِيهِنَّ ٱلْحَجَّ فَلاَ رَفَثَ وَلاَ فُسُوقَ وَلاَ جِدَالَ فِي ٱلْحَجِّ وَمَا تَفْعَلُواْ مِنْ خَيْرٍ يَعْلَمْهُ ٱللَّهُ وَتَزَوَّدُواْ فَإِنَّ خَيْرَ ٱلزَّادِ ٱلتَّقْوَىٰ وَٱتَّقُونِ يٰأُوْلِي ٱلأَلْبَابِ,The Pilgrimage the time for it is in months well-known Shawwāl Dhū’l-Qa’da and ten nights some say all of Dhū’l Hijja; whoever undertakes upon himself the duty of Pilgrimage during them by entering into the state of pilgrimage inviolability then no lewdness no sexual intercourse for them nor wickedness nor acts of disobedience or disputing or quarrelling in the Pilgrimage a variant reading for fa-lā rafathun wa-lā fusūqun wa-lā jidāla has the accusative for all three nouns sc. fa-lā rafatha wa-lā fusūqa wa-lā jidāla; prohibition is meant in all three cases. Whatever good you do by way of voluntary almsgiving God knows it and will reward you for it. And take provision to suffice you your journey this was revealed regarding the people of Yemen who use to make the Pilgrimage and not take any provisions with them thus becoming a burden for others. But the best provision is piety taqwā ‘piety’ literally ‘guarding’ with which you are able to guard against asking others for things; and fear you Me O people of pith! O possessors of intellect.
لَيْسَ عَلَيْكُمْ جُنَاحٌ أَن تَبْتَغُواْ فَضْلاً مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ فَإِذَآ أَفَضْتُم مِّنْ عَرَفَٰتٍ فَٱذْكُرُواْ ٱللَّهَ عِندَ ٱلْمَشْعَرِ ٱلْحَرَامِ وَٱذْكُرُوهُ كَمَا هَدَٰكُمْ وَإِن كُنْتُمْ مِّن قَبْلِهِ لَمِنَ ٱلضَّآلِّينَ,You would not be at fault if you should seek bounty sustenance from your Lord by engaging in commerce at the Pilgrimage this was revealed in response to their aversion to such an idea; but when you press on push on from ‘Arafāt having stood in prayer upon it then remember God after the overnight stay at Muzdalifa by repeating the talbiya sc. labbayka Llāhummā labbayk ‘at thy service O God at thy service’ the tahlīl lā ilāha illā Llāh ‘no god but God’ and making supplications at the Sacred Waymark a mountain at the end of Muzdalifa called Quzah. In one hadīth the Prophet s stood there remembering God and supplicating until his face began to glow brightly according to Muslim; and remember Him as He has guided you to the principal rites of His religion and the rituals of His Pilgrimage the kāf of ka-mā ‘as’ is the particle denoting the reason though previously before His guidance you were astray.
ثُمَّ أَفِيضُواْ مِنْ حَيْثُ أَفَاضَ ٱلنَّاسُ وَٱسْتَغْفِرُواْ ٱللَّهَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,Then thumma denotes the sequence intended press on O Quraysh from where the people press on that is from ‘Arafa by standing there together with them for they used to stand at Muzdalifa disdaining to stand with other people; and seek God’s forgiveness for your sins; God is Forgiving Merciful to the believers.
فَإِذَا قَضَيْتُمْ مَّنَاسِكَكُمْ فَٱذْكُرُواْ ٱللَّهَ كَذِكْرِكُمْ آبَآءَكُمْ أَوْ أَشَدَّ ذِكْراً فَمِنَ ٱلنَّاسِ مَن يَقُولُ رَبَّنَآ آتِنَا فِي ٱلدُّنْيَا وَمَا لَهُ فِي ٱلآخِرَةِ مِنْ خَلاَقٍ,And when you have performed and completed your holy rites that is the devotions pertaining to your pilgrimage having cast stones at the Jamrat al-‘Aqaba performed the circumambulation and stopped at Minā remember God by extolling Him and repeating the takbīr saying Allāhu akbar ‘God is Great’ as you remember your fathers as you used to remember them and boast about them at the end of your pilgrimage or yet more intensely than your remembrance of them ashadda is in the accusative because it is a circumstantial qualifier referring to dhikr ‘remembrance’ which itself is in the accusative as the object of udhkurū ‘remember’ because had it come after it it would have functioned as an adjectival phrase. There are some people who say ‘Our Lord give to us our lot in this world’ and they are given it; such people will have no part no lot in the Hereafter.
وِمِنْهُمْ مَّن يَقُولُ رَبَّنَآ آتِنَا فِي ٱلدُّنْيَا حَسَنَةً وَفِي ٱلآخِرَةِ حَسَنَةً وَقِنَا عَذَابَ ٱلنَّارِ,And there are others who say ‘Our Lord give to us in this world good a grace and good Paradise in the Hereafter and guard us against the chastisement of the Fire’ by not making us enter it. This former statement depicts the manner of the idolaters while the latter the way of the believers and is intended to encourage people to petition for good in both abodes for which one is promised a reward as He says
أُولَـٰئِكَ لَهُمْ نَصِيبٌ مِّمَّا كَسَبُواْ وَٱللَّهُ سَرِيعُ ٱلْحِسَابِ,Those — they shall have a portion a reward from as a result of what they have earned the deeds they have performed such as Pilgrimage and supplication; and God is swift at reckoning reckoning with the whole of creation in half a day of this world as one hadīth states.
وَٱذْكُرُواْ ٱللَّهَ فِيۤ أَيَّامٍ مَّعْدُودَاتٍ فَمَن تَعَجَّلَ فِي يَوْمَيْنِ فَلاَ إِثْمَ عَلَيْهِ وَمَن تَأَخَّرَ فَلاۤ إِثْمَ عَلَيْهِ لِمَنِ ٱتَّقَىٰ وَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَٱعْلَمُوآ أَنَّكُمْ إِلَيْهِ تُحْشَرُونَ,And remember God by making takbīr saying Allāhu akbar ‘God is Great’ while you cast your stones at the Jamarāt during certain days numbered the three days of tashrīq. If any man hastens on his departure from Minā in two days that is on the second day of tashrīq after he has cast his stones that hastening is no sin for him; and if he delays such that he stays until the third night and cast his stones it is not a sin for him that is they have the choice of either for the sin has been precluded in both cases; if he fears God during his pilgrimage — for such a person is truly a pilgrim — and fear God and know that to Him you shall be gathered in the Hereafter that He may requite you for your deeds.
وَمِنَ ٱلنَّاسِ مَن يُعْجِبُكَ قَوْلُهُ فِي ٱلْحَيَٰوةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَيُشْهِدُ ٱللَّهَ عَلَىٰ مَا فِي قَلْبِهِ وَهُوَ أَلَدُّ ٱلْخِصَامِ,And among people there is he whose speech in the life of this world pleases you but it would not please you in the Hereafter because it contradicts what he actually used to believe; and who calls on God to witness what is in his heart as being in accordance with what he says; yet he is most stubborn in dispute with you and your followers on account of his enmity towards you this was al-Akhnas b. Sharīq a hypocrite who spoke kindly in the presence of the Prophet s swearing that he believed in him and that he loved him and frequently sitting with him. God then revealed his mendacity in this matter. On one occasion he passed by some crops and livestock that belonged to the Muslims and later that night he set fire to them the crops and slaughtered them the livestock. God moreover says
وَإِذَا تَوَلَّىٰ سَعَىٰ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ لِيُفْسِدَ فِيِهَا وَيُهْلِكَ ٱلْحَرْثَ وَٱلنَّسْلَ وَٱللَّهُ لاَ يُحِبُّ ٱلفَسَادَ,And when he turns his back leaving you behind he hastens he walks about the earth to do corruption there and to destroy the tillage and the stock these last two actions are included in such ‘corruption’; and God loves not corruption that is to say it does not please Him.
وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُ ٱتَّقِ ٱللَّهَ أَخَذَتْهُ ٱلْعِزَّةُ بِٱلإِثْمِ فَحَسْبُهُ جَهَنَّمُ وَلَبِئْسَ ٱلْمِهَادُ,And when it is said to him ‘Fear God’ in your actions he is seized by vainglory pride and rage in his sin the one he was commanded to avoid committing. So Hell shall be enough it suffices for him — how evil a cradling a resting place it is!
وَمِنَ ٱلنَّاسِ مَن يَشْرِي نَفْسَهُ ٱبْتِغَآءَ مَرْضَاتِ ٱللَّهِ وَٱللَّهُ رَؤُوفٌ بِٱلْعِبَادِ,But there are other men who sell themselves expend themselves in obedience to God desiring God’s pleasure this was Suhayb b. Sinān al-Rūmī who emigrated to Medina when the idolaters began to persecute him leaving them all his property; and God is Gentle with His servants for He guides them to what pleases Him.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ ٱدْخُلُواْ فِي ٱلسِّلْمِ كَآفَّةً وَلاَ تَتَّبِعُواْ خُطُوَاتِ ٱلشَّيْطَانِ إِنَّهُ لَكُمْ عَدُوٌّ مُّبِينٌ,The following verse was revealed regarding ‘Abd Allāh b. Salām and his companions who after converting to Islam still observed the Sabbath with reverence and were averse to the consumption of camels O you who believe come all of you into submission read al-salm or al-silm that is Islam; kāffatan is a circumstantial qualifier referring to al-silm meaning into all of its precepts; and follow not the steps the ways of Satan that is his temptations to you by way of creating divisions; he is a manifest foe to you one whose enmity is obvious.
فَإِن زَلَلْتُمْ مِّن بَعْدِ مَا جَآءَتْكُمُ ٱلْبَيِّنَاتُ فَٱعْلَمُوۤاْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ,But if you slip and incline away from implementing all of its precepts after the clear proofs the lucid arguments have come to you to the effect that this is the truth know then that God is Mighty and nothing can prevent Him from taking His vengeance against you; Wise in His actions.
هَلْ يَنظُرُونَ إِلاَّ أَن يَأْتِيَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ فِي ظُلَلٍ مِّنَ ٱلْغَمَامِ وَٱلْمَلاۤئِكَةُ وَقُضِيَ ٱلأَمْرُ وَإِلَى ٱللَّهِ تُرْجَعُ ٱلأُمُورُ,What do they those that fail to enter into it sc. Islam completely wait for await that God shall come to them that is His Command; this is similar to where God says or that God’s command should come to pass Q. 1633 meaning His chastisement in the shadows zulal plural of zulla of clouds and the angels? The matter is determined the matter of their destruction has been completed and to God all matters are returned in the Hereafter where He will requite each according to his deeds read passive turja‘u al-umūr ‘matters are returned’ or active tarji‘u al-umūr ‘matters return’.
سَلْ بَنِيۤ إِسْرَائِيلَ كَمْ آتَيْنَاهُم مِّنْ آيَةٍ بَيِّنَةٍ وَمَن يُبَدِّلْ نِعْمَةَ ٱللَّهِ مِن بَعْدِ مَا جَآءَتْهُ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ شَدِيدُ ٱلْعِقَابِ,Ask O Muhammad (s) the Children of Israel by way of rebuke how many a clear proof manifest ones such as the parting of the sea and the sending down of manna and quails which they exchanged for unbelief did We give them kam ‘how many’ is the interrogative particle linking the second object of the verb sal ‘ask’ and is also the second object of the verb ātaynā ‘We gave’ and its specifier; whoever changes God’s grace that is what God has blessed him with in the way of signs for these constitute the causes of guidance after it has come to him out of unbelief God is severe in retribution against him.
زُيِّنَ لِلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ ٱلْحَيَاةُ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَيَسْخَرُونَ مِنَ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَٱلَّذِينَ ٱتَّقَواْ فَوْقَهُمْ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ وَٱللَّهُ يَرْزُقُ مَن يَشَآءُ بِغَيْرِ حِسَابٍ,Decked out fair to the disbelievers of Mecca is the life of this world in disguise and they have fallen in love with it; and they deride the believers on account of their poverty the likes of Bilāl al-Habashī ‘Ammār b. Yāsir and Suhayb al-Rūmī mocking them and treating them condescendingly with their wealth; but those who fear idolatry namely those mentioned shall be above them on the Day of Resurrection; and God sustains whomever He will without reckoning with ample sustenance in the Hereafter or in this world when He gives to those that were mocked possession of the property and lives of those that mocked them.
كَانَ ٱلنَّاسُ أُمَّةً وَٰحِدَةً فَبَعَثَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلنَّبِيِّينَ مُبَشِّرِينَ وَمُنذِرِينَ وَأَنزَلَ مَعَهُمُ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ بِٱلْحَقِّ لِيَحْكُمَ بَيْنَ ٱلنَّاسِ فِيمَا ٱخْتَلَفُواْ فِيهِ وَمَا ٱخْتَلَفَ فِيهِ إِلاَّ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُوهُ مِن بَعْدِ مَا جَآءَتْهُمُ ٱلْبَيِّنَٰتُ بَغْياً بَيْنَهُمْ فَهَدَى ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ لِمَا ٱخْتَلَفُواْ فِيهِ مِنَ ٱلْحَقِّ بِإِذْنِهِ وَٱللَّهُ يَهْدِي مَن يَشَآءُ إِلَىٰ صِرَٰطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ,People were one community in faith but they fell into disagreement and some believed while others disbelieved; then God sent forth the prophets to them as bearers of good tidings of Paradise for the believers and warners of the Fire for the disbelievers; and He revealed with them the Scripture meaning the Books with the truth bi’l-haqqi ‘with the truth’ is semantically connected to anzala ‘He revealed’ that He might decide according to it between people regarding their differences in religion; and only those who had been given it the Scripture so that some believed while others disbelieved differed about it about religion after the clear proofs the manifest arguments for God’s Oneness had come to them min of min ba‘di ‘after’ is semantically connected to ikhtalafa ‘they differed’ and together with what follows should be understood as coming before the exception illā lladhīna ‘only those’; out of insolence on the part of the disbelievers one to another; then God guided those who believed to the truth regarding which min of min al-haqqi ‘of the truth’ here is explicative they were at variance by His leave by His will; and God guides with His guidance whomever He will to a straight path the path of truth.
أَمْ حَسِبْتُمْ أَن تَدْخُلُواْ ٱلْجَنَّةَ وَلَمَّا يَأْتِكُم مَّثَلُ ٱلَّذِينَ خَلَوْاْ مِن قَبْلِكُم مَّسَّتْهُمُ ٱلْبَأْسَآءُ وَٱلضَّرَّآءُ وَزُلْزِلُواْ حَتَّىٰ يَقُولَ ٱلرَّسُولُ وَٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ مَعَهُ مَتَىٰ نَصْرُ ٱللَّهِ أَلاۤ إِنَّ نَصْرَ ٱللَّهِ قَرِيبٌ,The following was revealed after the Muslims suffered a trying experience Or did you suppose that you should enter Paradise without there having come upon you the like of what came upon those believers who passed away before you? of trials so that you may endure as they did; a new sentence begins here explaining the previous one They were afflicted by misery extreme poverty and hardship illness and were so convulsed by all types of tribulations that the Messenger and those who believed with him said read yaqūla or yaqūlu not expecting to see any help on account of the extreme hardship afflicting them ‘When will God’s help come?’ the help which we were promised; and God responded to them Ah but surely God’s help is nigh in coming.
يَسْأَلُونَكَ مَاذَا يُنْفِقُونَ قُلْ مَآ أَنْفَقْتُمْ مِّنْ خَيْرٍ فَلِلْوَالِدَيْنِ وَٱلأَقْرَبِينَ وَٱلْيَتَامَىٰ وَٱلْمَسَاكِينِ وَٱبْنِ ٱلسَّبِيلِ وَمَا تَفْعَلُواْ مِنْ خَيْرٍ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ بِهِ عَلِيمٌ,They will ask you O Muhammad (s) about what they should expend. This was the question posed by ‘Amr b. al-Jamūh. He was a wealthy elderly man and went to ask the Prophet s what and for whom he should expend; Say to them ‘Whatever you expend of good min khayrin ‘of good’ is an explication of mā ‘whatever’ covering small and large amounts and denotes one half of the question represented by the expender; God responds with regard to the one receiving the expenditure this pertaining to the other half of the question in the following it is for parents and kinsmen orphans the needy and the traveller that is they are the most deserving of it; and whatever good you may do by way of expending or otherwise God has knowledge of it’ and will requite it accordingly.
كُتِبَ عَلَيْكُمُ ٱلْقِتَالُ وَهُوَ كُرْهٌ لَّكُمْ وَعَسَىٰ أَن تَكْرَهُواْ شَيْئاً وَهُوَ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ وَعَسَىٰ أَن تُحِبُّواْ شَيْئاً وَهُوَ شَرٌّ لَّكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ وَأَنْتُمْ لاَ تَعْلَمُونَ,Prescribed for you obligatory for you is fighting disbelievers though it be hateful to you by nature because of the hardship involved. Yet it may happen that you hate a thing which is good for you; and it may happen that you love a thing which is bad for you because the soul inclines towards those desires which result in its destruction and its rejection of the religious obligations that would bring about its happiness. Perhaps then even if you are averse to it you will find much good in fighting as a result of victory booty martyrdom or reward; while if you were to reject fighting even if you would like to do so you will find much evil because then you may be subjugated impoverished and denied the reward; God knows what is good for you and you know this not so strive in what He commands you.
يَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ ٱلشَّهْرِ ٱلْحَرَامِ قِتَالٍ فِيهِ قُلْ قِتَالٌ فِيهِ كَبِيرٌ وَصَدٌّ عَن سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ وَكُفْرٌ بِهِ وَٱلْمَسْجِدِ ٱلْحَرَامِ وَإِخْرَاجُ أَهْلِهِ مِنْهُ أَكْبَرُ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ وَٱلْفِتْنَةُ أَكْبَرُ مِنَ ٱلْقَتْلِ وَلاَ يَزَالُونَ يُقَاتِلُونَكُمْ حَتَّىٰ يَرُدُّوكُمْ عَن دِينِكُمْ إِن اسْتَطَاعُواْ وَمَن يَرْتَدِدْ مِنْكُمْ عَن دِينِهِ فَيَمُتْ وَهُوَ كَافِرٌ فَأُوْلـٰئِكَ حَبِطَتْ أَعْمَالُهُمْ فِي ٱلدُّنْيَا وَٱلآخِرَةِ وَأُوْلـٰئِكَ أَصْحَابُ ٱلنَّارِ هُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ,Thus the Prophet s sent forth the first of his raiding parties under the command of ‘Abd Allāh b. Jahsh. They fought against the idolaters and killed ‘Amr b. ‘Abd Allāh Ibn al-Hadramī in the sacred month of Rajab thinking that it was the last day of Jumādā II. The disbelievers reviled them for making fighting lawful in a sacred month and so God revealed the following They ask you about the sacred the forbidden month and fighting in it qitālin fīhi ‘fighting in it’ is an inclusive substitution for al-shahri l-harāmi ‘the sacred month’. Say to them ‘Fighting qitālun is the subject in it is a grave thing kabīr ‘grave’ is the predicate that is heinous in terms of sin; but to bar saddun is the subject people from God’s way His religion and disbelief in Him in God and to bar from the Sacred Mosque that is Mecca and to expel its people the Prophet s and the believers from it — that is graver the predicate of the last subject that is more heinous in terms of sin than fighting in it in God’s sight; and sedition your idolatry is graver than your slaying’ in it. They the disbelievers will not cease to fight against you O believers until so that they turn you from your religion to unbelief if they are able; and whoever of you turns from his religion and dies disbelieving — their good works have failed that is they are invalid in this world and the Hereafter. Thus they will not count for anything and will not result in any reward. The specification of death as a condition is because if that person were to return to Islam again his original deeds would not be invalidated and he will be rewarded for them and he would not have to repeat them deeds such as performing the Pilgrimage al-Shāfi‘ī is of this opinion. Those are the inhabitants of the Fire abiding therein.
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَٱلَّذِينَ هَاجَرُواْ وَجَٰهَدُواْ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ أُوْلـٰئِكَ يَرْجُونَ رَحْمَتَ ٱللَّهِ وَٱللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,When those of the raiding party of ‘Abd Allāh b. Jahsh thought that although they had been released from the sin of having slain in the sacred month they would not receive any reward the following was revealed Verily the believers and those who emigrate and depart from their homeland and struggle in God’s way in order to elevate His religion — those have hope of God’s compassion His reward; and God is Forgiving of believers Merciful to them.
يَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ ٱلْخَمْرِ وَٱلْمَيْسِرِ قُلْ فِيهِمَآ إِثْمٌ كَبِيرٌ وَمَنَٰفِعُ لِلنَّاسِ وَإِثْمُهُمَآ أَكْبَرُ مِن نَّفْعِهِمَا وَيَسْأَلُونَكَ مَاذَا يُنفِقُونَ قُلِ ٱلْعَفْوَ كَذٰلِكَ يُبيِّنُ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمُ ٱلأيَٰتِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَفَكَّرُونَ,They ask you about wine and divinatory arrows gambling and what the ruling is regarding them. Say to them ‘In both that is in the partaking of both is great sin a variant reading for kabīr ‘great’ has kathīr ‘much’ because of the fighting cursing and swearing that ensue from it; and profit for men by way of delight and enjoyment in wine and acquiring money effortlessly from gambling; but the sin in them that is the degenerate behaviour in which they result is greater graver than the usefulness’. When this verse was revealed some gave up drinking while others persisted until the verse of sūrat al-Mā’ida Q. 590-91 finally made it illicit. And they will ask you what that is to say how much they should expend. Say expend ‘Comfortably’ al-‘afwa in the accusative is also read in the nominative al-‘afwu implying a preceding huwa that is the surplus of your need and do not expend what you need ruining yourselves. So just as He explained to you what has been mentioned God makes clear His signs to you that you might reflect
فِي ٱلدُّنْيَا وَٱلآخِرَةِ وَيَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ ٱلْيَتَامَىٰ قُلْ إِصْلاَحٌ لَّهُمْ خَيْرٌ وَإِنْ تُخَالِطُوهُمْ فَإِخْوَانُكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ ٱلْمُفْسِدَ مِنَ ٱلْمُصْلِحِ وَلَوْ شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ لأَعْنَتَكُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ,on the matters of this world and the Hereafter and follow what is best for you in both. They will ask you about orphans and the distress their affair caused them for if they became intimate with them they may slip into error but if they put aside the money due to them and prepare their meals for them separately this would distress them. Say ‘To set their affairs aright in terms of their funds by looking after it and your mingling with them is better’ than you not doing this; and if you intermix with them your funds and theirs they are your brothers in religion and it is only natural for one to intermix his affair with his brother so you do too; God knows well him who works corruption in their property when he intermixes with them from him who sets it aright and God will requite both; and had He willed He would have harassed you and made it difficult for you by prohibiting you from intermixing with them. Surely God is Mighty victorious in His affair Wise in His actions.
وَلاَ تَنْكِحُواْ ٱلْمُشْرِكَاتِ حَتَّىٰ يُؤْمِنَّ وَلأَمَةٌ مُّؤْمِنَةٌ خَيْرٌ مِّن مُّشْرِكَةٍ وَلَوْ أَعْجَبَتْكُمْ وَلاَ تُنْكِحُواْ ٱلْمُشِرِكِينَ حَتَّىٰ يُؤْمِنُواْ وَلَعَبْدٌ مُّؤْمِنٌ خَيْرٌ مِّن مُّشْرِكٍ وَلَوْ أَعْجَبَكُمْ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ يَدْعُونَ إِلَى ٱلنَّارِ وَٱللَّهُ يَدْعُوۤاْ إِلَى ٱلْجَنَّةِ وَٱلْمَغْفِرَةِ بِإِذْنِهِ وَيُبَيِّنُ آيَاتِهِ لِلنَّاسِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَذَكَّرُونَ,O Muslims Do not marry idolatresses disbelievers until they believe; a believing slavegirl is better than an idolatress who may be a free woman; this was revealed as a rebuttal of the idea that it was shameful to marry a slavegirl and that it was better to marry an idolatress free woman; though you may admire her because of her beauty and wealth this provision excludes the womenfolk of the People of the Scripture as indicated by the verse Q. 55 lawful to you are the chaste women among those who were given the Scripture. And do not marry off believing women to idolaters until they believe. A believing slave is better than an idolater though you may admire him for his wealth and good looks. Those the people of idolatry call to the Fire because they invite one to perform deeds that merit this and for this reason one should not marry with them; and God calls through the voice of His prophets to Paradise and pardon that is to the deeds that merit these two by His leave by His will so that His call may be heeded by marrying with His friends; and He makes clear His signs to the people so that they might remember that they might be admonished.
وَيَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ ٱلْمَحِيضِ قُلْ هُوَ أَذًى فَٱعْتَزِلُواْ ٱلنِّسَآءَ فِي ٱلْمَحِيضِ وَلاَ تَقْرَبُوهُنَّ حَتَّىٰ يَطْهُرْنَ فَإِذَا تَطَهَّرْنَ فَأْتُوهُنَّ مِنْ حَيْثُ أَمَرَكُمُ ٱللَّهُ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُحِبُّ ٱلتَّوَّابِينَ وَيُحِبُّ ٱلْمُتَطَهِّرِينَ,They will ask you about the monthly period that is menstruation and the spot in which it occurs and how should one treat women during it. Say ‘It is an ailment filth or the place whence it issues is so; so part with women refrain from sexual intercourse with them in the monthly period in this time or in the part affected; and do not approach them for sexual intercourse until they are pure yathurna or yattahharna the original tā’ of yatatahharna has been assimilated with the tā’ that is until they have cleansed themselves after its cessation; when they have cleansed themselves then come to them in sexual intercourse as God has commanded you’ by avoiding it the female organ during menstruation and not resorting to any other part. Truly God loves that is He rewards and honours those who repent of sins and He loves those who cleanse themselves from impurities.
نِسَآؤُكُمْ حَرْثٌ لَّكُمْ فَأْتُواْ حَرْثَكُمْ أَنَّىٰ شِئْتُمْ وَقَدِّمُواْ لأَنْفُسِكُمْ وَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَٱعْلَمُوۤاْ أَنَّكُمْ مُّلاَقُوهُ وَبَشِّرِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,Your women are a tillage for you that is the place where you sow the seeds of your children; so come to your tillage that is the specified place the front part as in whichever way you wish whether standing up sitting down lying down from the front or the back this was revealed in response to the Jews saying that if a person had vaginal intercourse with his wife from behind the child would be born cross-eyed; and offer for your souls righteous deeds such as saying ‘In the Name of God’ bismillāh when you commence intercourse; and fear God in what He commands and prohibits; and know that you shall meet Him at the Resurrection where He will requite you according to your deeds; and give good tidings of Paradise to the believers who feared Him.
وَلاَ تَجْعَلُواْ ٱللَّهَ عُرْضَةً لأَيْمَانِكُمْ أَن تَبَرُّواْ وَتَتَّقُواْ وَتُصْلِحُواْ بَيْنَ ٱلنَّاسِ وَٱللَّهُ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ,Do not make God by swearing in His Name a hindrance a cause of impediment in your oaths that is setting up such impediments by swearing in His Name frequently so as not to be pious and God-fearing; in such instances oaths are hateful and result in perjury which requires a redemption effected by doing the opposite of the oath such as performing righteous deeds and so forth which constitute an act of obedience; and to put things right between people this means do not be prevented from doing righteous deeds as mentioned just because you swore against them; nay do them and make redemption; this understanding of the verse is justified by the reason for its revelation namely their refraining from such deeds; surely God is All-Hearing of what you say Knower of your circumstances.
لاَّ يُؤَاخِذُكُمُ ٱللَّهُ بِٱلَّلغْوِ فِيۤ أَيْمَانِكُمْ وَلَـٰكِن يُؤَاخِذُكُم بِمَا كَسَبَتْ قُلُوبُكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ غَفُورٌ حَلِيمٌ,God will not take you to task for a slip that results in your oaths which is what the tongue utters spontaneously and unintentionally such as ‘By God’ ‘Indeed by God’ in such instances there is no sin and no redemption required; but He will take you to task for what your hearts have earned what their intention is when you commit perjury in your oaths; and God is Forgiving of slips in your oaths Forbearing since He delays the punishment of the one deserving it.
لِّلَّذِينَ يُؤْلُونَ مِن نِّسَآئِهِمْ تَرَبُّصُ أَرْبَعَةِ أَشْهُرٍ فَإِنْ فَآءُو فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,For those who forswear their women by swearing that they will not have sexual intercourse with them a wait of four months; if they revert back from the oath or repeal it and resume sexual relations God is Forgiving of the harm they caused their women by swearing Merciful to them.
وَإِنْ عَزَمُواْ ٱلطَّلاَقَ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ,But if they resolve upon divorce by not repealing it then let them go through with it; surely God is Hearing of what they say; Knowing of their resolve meaning that after the waiting period mentioned they can only revert or divorce.
وَٱلْمُطَلَّقَاتُ يَتَرَبَّصْنَ بِأَنْفُسِهِنَّ ثَلاَثَةَ قُرُوۤءٍ وَلاَ يَحِلُّ لَهُنَّ أَن يَكْتُمْنَ مَا خَلَقَ ٱللَّهُ فِيۤ أَرْحَامِهِنَّ إِن كُنَّ يُؤْمِنَّ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلآخِرِ وَبُعُولَتُهُنَّ أَحَقُّ بِرَدِّهِنَّ فِي ذَلِكَ إِنْ أَرَادُوۤاْ إِصْلاَحاً وَلَهُنَّ مِثْلُ ٱلَّذِي عَلَيْهِنَّ بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ وَلِلرِّجَالِ عَلَيْهِنَّ دَرَجَةٌ وَٱللَّهُ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ,Divorced women shall wait by themselves before remarrying for three periods qurū’in is the plural of qar’ of purity or menstruation — these are two different opinions — which begin from the moment of divorce. This stipulation applies to those who have been sexually penetrated but not to those otherwise on account of His saying there shall be no waiting period for you to reckon against them Q. 3349. The waiting period for immature or menopausal women is three months; pregnant women on the other hand must wait until they give birth as stated in the sūrat al-Talāq Q. 654 while slavegirls must wait two months according to the Sunna. And it is not lawful for them to hide what God has created in their wombs of child or menstruation if they believe in God and the Last Day. Their mates their spouses have a better right to restore them to bring them back even if they refuse in such time that is during the waiting period if they desire to set things right between them and put pressure on the woman to return; the statement is not a condition for the possibility of return but an incitement to set things right in the case of repealed divorce; the term ahaqq ‘better right to’ does not denote any priority since in any case no other person has the right to marry them during their waiting period; women shall have rights due from their spouses similar to those rights due from them with justice as stipulated by the Law in the way of kind conjugality and not being harmed; but their men have a degree above them in rights as in their duty to obey their husbands because of their the husbands’ payment of a dowry and their husbands being the bread-winners; God is Mighty in His Kingdom Wise in what He has ordained for His creatures.
ٱلطَّلَٰقُ مَرَّتَانِ فَإِمْسَاكٌ بِمَعْرُوفٍ أَوْ تَسْرِيحٌ بِإِحْسَٰنٍ وَلاَ يَحِلُّ لَكُمْ أَن تَأْخُذُواْ مِمَّآ آتَيْتُمُوهُنَّ شَيْئاً إِلاَّ أَن يَخَافَآ أَلاَّ يُقِيمَا حُدُودَ ٱللَّهِ فَإِنْ خِفْتُمْ أَلاَّ يُقِيمَا حُدُودَ ٱللَّهِ فَلاَ جُنَاحَ عَلَيْهِمَا فِيمَا ٱفْتَدَتْ بِهِ تِلْكَ حُدُودُ ٱللَّهِ فَلاَ تَعْتَدُوهَا وَمَن يَتَعَدَّ حُدُودَ ٱللَّهِ فَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلظَّٰلِمُونَ,Divorce that is repudiation of the type that may be revoked is twice; then honourable retention that is to say you are then obliged to revert to them to retain them without harming them; or setting them free kindly. It is not lawful for you O male spouses to take of what you have given them of dowry if you divorce them unless the married couple fear that they may not maintain God’s bounds that is to say that they will not honour the rights God has established for them a variant reading for yakhāfā ‘they dual form fear’ has yukhāfā with the direct object taking the accusative ending; allā yuqīmā is an inclusive substitution for the person governing the verb; both verbs are also read in the second person sc. takhāfā ‘you fear’ tuqīmā ‘you maintain’. If you fear they may not maintain God’s bounds neither of them would be at fault if she were to ransom herself of some money so that he should divorce her. In other words in this instance there is no culpability either for the man should he take of the dowry or for the woman should she offer of it. Those prescriptions mentioned are God’s bounds; do not transgress them. Whoever transgresses God’s bounds — those are the evildoers.
فَإِنْ طَلَّقَهَا فَلاَ تَحِلُّ لَهُ مِن بَعْدُ حَتَّىٰ تَنْكِحَ زَوْجاً غَيْرَهُ فَإِن طَلَّقَهَا فَلاَ جُنَاحَ عَلَيْهِمَآ أَن يَتَرَاجَعَآ إِن ظَنَّآ أَن يُقِيمَا حُدُودَ ٱللَّهِ وَتِلْكَ حُدُودُ ٱللَّهِ يُبَيِّنُهَا لِقَوْمٍ يَعْلَمُونَ,If he the husband divorces her after the two utterances of divorce; she shall not be lawful to him after that after the third utterance of divorce until she marries another husband who has sexual intercourse with her as reported by the two Shaykhs Bukhārī and Muslim. If he the second husband divorces her then neither of them would be at fault that is the woman and her first husband to return to each other in wedlock after the completion of the waiting period if they think that they will maintain God’s bounds. Those matters mentioned are God’s bounds which He makes clear to a people who have knowledge a people who reflect.
وَإِذَا طَلَّقْتُمُ ٱلنِّسَآءَ فَبَلَغْنَ أَجَلَهُنَّ فَأَمْسِكُوهُنَّ بِمَعْرُوفٍ أَوْ سَرِّحُوهُنَّ بِمَعْرُوفٍ وَلاَ تُمْسِكُوهُنَّ ضِرَاراً لِّتَعْتَدُواْ وَمَن يَفْعَلْ ذَلِكَ فَقَدْ ظَلَمَ نَفْسَهُ وَلاَ تَتَّخِذُوۤاْ آيَاتِ ٱللَّهِ هُزُواً وَٱذْكُرُواْ نِعْمَتَ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ وَمَآ أَنزَلَ عَلَيْكُمْ مِّنَ ٱلْكِتَابِ وَٱلْحِكْمَةِ يَعِظُكُمْ بِهِ وَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَٱعْلَمُوۤاْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عَلِيمٌ,When you divorce women and they have very nearly reached the end of their term then retain them by returning to them honourably not harming them or set them free honourably or leave them until their term is completed; do not retain them when reverting in harm dirāran is an object denoting reason to transgress that is so as to force them to redemption or to repudiate them or confine them indoors for a long time; whoever does that has wronged his soul by exposing it to God’s chastisement; take not God’s verses in mockery in jest by contravening them and remember God’s grace upon you that is Islam and the Book the Qur’ān and the wisdom the rulings contained therein He has revealed to you to exhort you therewith so that you should give thanks by acting in accordance with it; and fear God and know that God has knowledge of all things and nothing can be hidden from Him.
وَإِذَا طَلَّقْتُمُ ٱلنِّسَآءَ فَبَلَغْنَ أَجَلَهُنَّ فَلاَ تَعْضُلُوهُنَّ أَن يَنكِحْنَ أَزْوَاجَهُنَّ إِذَا تَرَاضَوْاْ بَيْنَهُمْ بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ ذٰلِكَ يُوعَظُ بِهِ مَن كَانَ مِنكُمْ يُؤْمِنُ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلآخِرِ ذٰلِكُمْ أَزْكَىٰ لَكُمْ وَأَطْهَرُ وَٱللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ وَأَنْتُمْ لاَ تَعْلَمُونَ,When you divorce women and they have reached completed their term of waiting do not debar them — addressing the guardians here — from marrying their divorced husbands when they the male spouses and their women have agreed together honourably in accordance with the Law. The occasion for the revelation of this verse was Ma‘qil b. Yasār’s sister was divorced by her husband who then wanted to restore her but Ma‘qil refused as reported by al-Hākim. That the prohibition against debarring is an admonition for whoever of you believe in God and the Last Day because it is for the benefit of such a person; that refraining from debarring is purer for you better and cleaner for you and for them bearing in mind the suspicion that can be aroused by the couple on account of prior intimacy. God knows what is in your interest and you know not any of this so follow His commands.
وَٱلْوَالِدَاتُ يُرْضِعْنَ أَوْلاَدَهُنَّ حَوْلَيْنِ كَامِلَيْنِ لِمَنْ أَرَادَ أَن يُتِمَّ ٱلرَّضَاعَةَ وَعلَى ٱلْمَوْلُودِ لَهُ رِزْقُهُنَّ وَكِسْوَتُهُنَّ بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ لاَ تُكَلَّفُ نَفْسٌ إِلاَّ وُسْعَهَا لاَ تُضَآرَّ وَالِدَةٌ بِوَلَدِهَا وَلاَ مَوْلُودٌ لَّهُ بِوَلَدِهِ وَعَلَى ٱلْوَارِثِ مِثْلُ ذٰلِكَ فَإِنْ أَرَادَا فِصَالاً عَن تَرَاضٍ مِّنْهُمَا وَتَشَاوُرٍ فَلاَ جُنَاحَ عَلَيْهِمَا وَإِنْ أَرَدتُّمْ أَن تَسْتَرْضِعُوۤاْ أَوْلاَدَكُمْ فَلاَ جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ إِذَا سَلَّمْتُم مَّآ آتَيْتُم بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ وَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَٱعْلَمُوۤاْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ,Mothers shall suckle their children for two full years kāmilayn ‘two full ones’ is an adjective for emphasis; this is for such as desire to fulfil the suckling and this is the maximum length of time. It is for the father to provide food for them the mothers and clothe them during the suckling if they be divorced honourably to the best of his ability. No soul is charged save to its capacity its ability; a mother shall not be harmed by her child that is on account of the child by being forced to suckle it if she does not want to; neither should a father be harmed by his child that is on account of it by being charged with more than he is able to bear. The mention of both parents here in relation to the child is intended to show sympathy for both. The heir the one inheriting from his father that is the young man who is the trustee of his father’s property has a similar duty to that of the father in terms of providing sustenance and clothing for the other parent. But if the two parents desire by mutual consent agreement and consultation so that the child’s best interests are clear to wean that is to effect ablactation before the completion of the two-year period then they would not be at fault in this matter. And if you addressing the parents desire to seek nursing from other than the mothers for your children you would not be at fault in this respect provided you hand over to them what you have given what you intend to give them in the way of wages honourably in kindness and good nature; and fear God and know that God sees what you do and that nothing of it can be hidden from Him.
وَٱلَّذِينَ يُتَوَفَّوْنَ مِنكُمْ وَيَذَرُونَ أَزْوَاجاً يَتَرَبَّصْنَ بِأَنْفُسِهِنَّ أَرْبَعَةَ أَشْهُرٍ وَعَشْراً فَإِذَا بَلَغْنَ أَجَلَهُنَّ فَلاَ جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ فِيمَا فَعَلْنَ فِيۤ أَنْفُسِهِنَّ بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ وَٱللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيرٌ,And those of you who pass away die leaving behind wives they shall wait by themselves after their death refraining from marriage for four months and ten nights this applies to women who are not pregnant. The waiting period in the case of pregnant women is for them to give birth — as stated by a verse in sūrat al-Talāq Q. 654. The slavegirl must wait for half this period of four months according to the Sunna; when they have reached completed their term of waiting then you would not be at fault O guardians regarding what they may do with themselves in the way of adorning themselves and offering themselves before suitors honourably in accordance with the Law; God is aware of what you do both secretly and openly.
وَلاَ جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ فِيمَا عَرَّضْتُمْ بِهِ مِنْ خِطْبَةِ ٱلنِّسَآءِ أَوْ أَكْنَنتُمْ فِيۤ أَنْفُسِكُمْ عَلِمَ ٱللَّهُ أَنَّكُمْ سَتَذْكُرُونَهُنَّ وَلَـٰكِن لاَّ تُوَاعِدُوهُنَّ سِرّاً إِلاَّ أَن تَقُولُواْ قَوْلاً مَّعْرُوفاً وَلاَ تَعْزِمُوۤاْ عُقْدَةَ ٱلنِّكَاحِ حَتَّىٰ يَبْلُغَ ٱلْكِتَابُ أَجَلَهُ وَٱعْلَمُوۤاْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَعْلَمُ مَا فِيۤ أَنْفُسِكُمْ فَٱحْذَرُوهُ وَٱعْلَمُوۤاْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ حَلِيمٌ,You would not be at fault regarding the proposal with the intention of marriage you present offer or hide in your hearts during the waiting period to women whose spouses have died such as men saying ‘How beautiful you are!’ or ‘Who could find one like you?’ or ‘How many a man must desire you!’. God knows that you will be mindful of them in proposing to them impatiently and so He has permitted you to make such offers; but do not make arrangements of marriage with them secretly unless you speak honourable words such as are acknowledged by the Law in other words such as proposals that which is permitted to you. And do not resolve on the knot the consummation of marriage until that which is written the period prescribed has reached its term and has been completed; and know that God knows what is in your souls of resolve or otherwise; so be fearful of Him that He should chastise you if you have made such resolve; and know that God is Forgiving toward him who is fearful of Him Forbearing in delaying the chastisement of the one deserving it.
لاَّ جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ إِن طَلَّقْتُمُ ٱلنِّسَآءَ مَا لَمْ تَمَسُّوهُنَّ أَوْ تَفْرِضُواْ لَهُنَّ فَرِيضَةً وَمَتِّعُوهُنَّ عَلَى ٱلْمُوسِعِ قَدَرُهُ وَعَلَى ٱلْمُقْتِرِ قَدَرُهُ مَتَاعاً بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ حَقّاً عَلَى ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,You would not be at fault if you divorce women while you have not touched them tamassūhunna also read tumāssūhunna that is while you have not had sexual intercourse with them nor appointed any obligation dowry for them the particle mā ‘while’ relates to the verbal action and is also adverbial that is to say there are no sinful consequences for divorcing them if you have not copulated with them or assigned them a dowry so divorce them; yet make provision of comforts for them honourably that is in accordance with the Law bi’l-ma‘rūf ‘honourably’ is an adjectival qualification of matā‘an ‘comforts’ giving them what they can enjoy the one of ample means the affluent among you according to his means and the needy man of restricted income according to his means — an obligation haqqan ‘obligation’ is either a second qualifier of matā‘an ‘comforts’ or an emphatic verbal noun on the virtuous the obedient ones.
وَإِن طَلَّقْتُمُوهُنَّ مِن قَبْلِ أَن تَمَسُّوهُنَّ وَقَدْ فَرَضْتُمْ لَهُنَّ فَرِيضَةً فَنِصْفُ مَا فَرَضْتُمْ إِلاَّ أَن يَعْفُونَ أَوْ يَعْفُوَاْ ٱلَّذِي بِيَدِهِ عُقْدَةُ ٱلنِّكَاحِ وَأَن تَعْفُوۤاْ أَقْرَبُ لِلتَّقْوَىٰ وَلاَ تَنسَوُاْ ٱلْفَضْلَ بَيْنَكُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ,And if you divorce them before you have touched them and you have already appointed for them an obligation then one-half of what you have appointed must be given to them and the other half returns to you; unless it be that they the women make remission and forgo it or he makes remission by leaving her the entire amount the one in whose hand is the knot of marriage the husband to be or as Ibn ‘Abbās is reported to have said ‘The legal guardian where the female is a minor’; in which case nobody would be at fault; yet that you should remit wa-an ta‘fū is the subject is nearer to piety aqrabu li’l-taqwā is its predicate. Forget not kindness between you that is to be bountiful towards one another; surely God sees what you do and will requite you accordingly.
حَافِظُواْ عَلَى ٱلصَّلَوَٰتِ وٱلصَّلَٰوةِ ٱلْوُسْطَىٰ وَقُومُواْ للَّهِ قَٰنِتِينَ,Maintain the five prayers by performing them at their appointed times and the middle prayer either that of the afternoon or the morning or the midday or another prayer there are many opinions on this matter; God has singled it out for mention because of its merit; and stand in prayer submissive to God li Lllāhi qānitīn some have said that this means ‘obedience’ on account of the Prophet s saying ‘Wherever the expression qunūt ‘submission’ appears in the Qur’ān it denotes obedience’ as reported by Ahmad b. Hanbal and others; it is also said to mean ‘in silence’ sākitīn on the basis of a hadīth of Zayd b. Arqam in which he said ‘We used to speak to each other sometimes during prayer but when this was revealed we were commanded to be silent and were forbidden to talk’ as reported by the two Shaykhs Bukhārī and Muslim.
فَإنْ خِفْتُمْ فَرِجَالاً أَوْ رُكْبَاناً فَإِذَآ أَمِنتُمْ فَٱذْكُرُواْ ٱللَّهَ كَمَا عَلَّمَكُم مَّا لَمْ تَكُونُواْ تَعْلَمُونَ,And if you are in fear of an enemy or a torrent or a predatory animal then standing rijāl plural of rājil praying while walking or mounted rukbān plural of rākib. In other words in whichever way you can facing the direction of the qibla or otherwise making the gestures of genuflexion and prostration; but when you are secure from any fear then remember God by performing prayer as He taught you what you knew not before He taught you its obligations and its proper ways the particle kāf of ka-mā ‘as’ has the same meaning as mithl ‘like’ while the mā is related to the verbal action or is relative.
وَٱلَّذِينَ يُتَوَفَّوْنَ مِنكُمْ وَيَذَرُونَ أَزْوَاجاً وَصِيَّةً لأَزْوَاجِهِمْ مَّتَاعاً إِلَى ٱلْحَوْلِ غَيْرَ إِخْرَاجٍ فَإِنْ خَرَجْنَ فَلاَ جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ فِي مَا فَعَلْنَ فِيۤ أَنْفُسِهِنَّ مِن مَّعْرُوفٍ وَٱللَّهُ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ,And those of you who die leaving wives let them make testament wasiyyatan or wasiyyatun for their wives as an obligation and give them provision what they can enjoy of property and clothes for until the completion of a year matā‘an ilā l-hawl ‘provision for a year’ is a circumstantial qualifier that is without expelling them from their habitations; but if they go forth of their own accord you would not be at fault you the guardians of the dead one regarding what they may do with themselves honourably in accordance with the Law such as adorning themselves or abandoning the mourning or that you should cut off their expenditure; God is Mighty in His Kingdom Wise in His actions. The testament mentioned here was abrogated by the ‘inheritance’ verse Q. 412 and the waiting of one year without expulsion was abrogated by the previous verse four months and ten Q. 2234 which was revealed later. In the opinion of al-Shāfi‘ī may God have mercy on him the habitation remains hers.
وَلِلْمُطَلَّقَاتِ مَتَاعٌ بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ حَقّاً عَلَى ٱلْمُتَّقِينَ,There shall be provision for divorced women which they are given honourably as is feasible — an obligation haqqan ‘obligation’ is in the accusative because it is governed by an implied verb on those who fear God may He be exalted. He has repeated the phrase in order to include the woman that has been touched sexually since the previous verse addresses a different issue.
كَذَلِكَ يُبَيِّنُ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمْ آيَاتِهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ,So in the same way that He has explained to you what has been mentioned God makes clear His signs for you so that you might understand reflect.
أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى ٱلَّذِينَ خَرَجُواْ مِن دِيَٰرِهِمْ وَهُمْ أُلُوفٌ حَذَرَ ٱلْمَوْتِ فَقَالَ لَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ مُوتُواْ ثُمَّ أَحْيَٰهُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَذُو فَضْلٍ عَلَى ٱلنَّاسِ وَلَـٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ ٱلنَّاسِ لاَ يَشْكُرُونَ,Have you not seen an interrogative to provoke amazement and a longing to hear what will follow that is ‘Has your knowledge not attained’ those thousands four eight ten thirty forty or seventy thousand who went forth from their habitations fearful of death? hadhara’l-mawt an object denoting reason. These were a people from among the Children of Israel who fled their homeland after it was afflicted with plague. God said to them ‘Die!’ and they did. Then He gave them life after eight days or more as a result of the supplication of their prophet Ezekiel Hizqīl and they lived on for a while with the effects of death still upon them such that when they wore garments these turned into shrouds for the deceased; and this phenomenon remained with their descendants. Truly God is bounteous to people such as when He gave life back to those just mentioned but most people that is disbelievers are not thankful. The purpose of mentioning the story of these people is to encourage believers to fight in the way of God which is why the following statement is supplemented to it
وَقَٰتِلُواْ فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ وَٱعْلَمُوۤاْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ,So fight in God’s way in order to elevate His religion and know that God is Hearing of your sayings Knowing of your affairs and He will requite you accordingly.
مَّن ذَا ٱلَّذِي يُقْرِضُ ٱللَّهَ قَرْضاً حَسَناً فَيُضَٰعِفَهُ لَهُ أَضْعَافاً كَثِيرَةً وَٱللَّهُ يَقْبِضُ وَيَبْسُطُ وَإِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ,Who is he that will lend God a loan by expending his property in the way of God that is good by expending it for the sake of God Mighty and Majestic out of pureness of heart and He will multiply yudā‘if also read yuda‘‘if it for him manifold? up to ten or seven hundred times or more as will be mentioned soon. God straitens sustenance for whomever He wills in order to try him and enlarges it in abundance for whomever He wills in order to test him; and to Him you shall be returned in the Hereafter through the Resurrection where He will requite you for your deeds.
أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى ٱلْمَلإِ مِن بَنِيۤ إِسْرَائِيلَ مِن بَعْدِ مُوسَىۤ إِذْ قَالُواْ لِنَبِيٍّ لَّهُمُ ٱبْعَثْ لَنَا مَلِكاً نُّقَاتِلْ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ قَالَ هَلْ عَسَيْتُمْ إِن كُتِبَ عَلَيْكُمُ ٱلْقِتَالُ أَلاَّ تُقَاتِلُواْ قَالُواْ وَمَا لَنَآ أَلاَّ نُقَاتِلَ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ وَقَدْ أُخْرِجْنَا مِن دِيَارِنَا وَأَبْنَآئِنَا فَلَمَّا كُتِبَ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلْقِتَالُ تَوَلَّوْاْ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً مِّنْهُمْ وَٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ بِٱلظَّالِمِينَ,Have you not seen the story and the tale of the council an assembly of the Children of Israel after the death of Moses when they said to a prophet of theirs namely Samuel ‘Send establish for us a king to unite us and to whom we can refer matters and we will fight with him in God’s way’. He the prophet said to them ‘Might it be that ‘asaytum or ‘asītum if fighting is prescribed for you you will not fight? allā tuqātilū is the predicate of ‘asā ‘might it be’; the interrogative is intended to confirm the expectation that follows sc. that they will not fight. They said ‘Why should we not fight in God’s way when we have been expelled from our habitations and our children?’ as a result of these latter being taken captive or killed that which they suffered at the hands of Goliath and his men. The meaning is ‘There is nothing to stop us fighting provided the requirement we demanded is forthcoming’. God exalted be He says Yet when fighting was prescribed for them they turned their backs from fighting in cowardice except a few of them the ones that crossed the river with Saul Tālūt as will be mentioned; and God has knowledge of the evildoers and will requite them accordingly. The prophet then asked his Lord to send forth a king and God responded by sending forth Saul.
وَقَالَ لَهُمْ نَبِيُّهُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ قَدْ بَعَثَ لَكُمْ طَالُوتَ مَلِكاً قَالُوۤاْ أَنَّىٰ يَكُونُ لَهُ ٱلْمُلْكُ عَلَيْنَا وَنَحْنُ أَحَقُّ بِٱلْمُلْكِ مِنْهُ وَلَمْ يُؤْتَ سَعَةً مِّنَ ٱلْمَالِ قَالَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ ٱصْطَفَاهُ عَلَيْكُمْ وَزَادَهُ بَسْطَةً فِي ٱلْعِلْمِ وَٱلْجِسْمِ وَٱللَّهُ يُؤْتِي مُلْكَهُ مَن يَشَآءُ وَٱللَّهُ وَاسِعٌ عَلِيمٌ,Then their prophet said to them ‘Verily God has raised up Saul for you as king’ They said ‘How can he be king over us when we have better right than he to kingship since he is not of the tribe of monarchs or that of prophets; he Saul was a tanner or a shepherd; seeing he has not been given amplitude of wealth?’ which he can use to establish a kingdom. He the prophet said to them ‘God has chosen him over you for kingship and has increased him broadly amply in knowledge and body at that time he was the most knowledgeable and the most handsome of all the Children of Israel and the most perfect of character. God gives the kingship to whom He will in the way He does and there can be no objection; and God is Embracing in His bounty Knowing of those who deserve it.
وَقَالَ لَهُمْ نِبِيُّهُمْ إِنَّ آيَةَ مُلْكِهِ أَن يَأْتِيَكُمُ ٱلتَّابُوتُ فِيهِ سَكِينَةٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَبَقِيَّةٌ مِّمَّا تَرَكَ آلُ مُوسَىٰ وَآلُ هَارُونَ تَحْمِلُهُ ٱلْمَلاۤئِكَةُ إِنَّ فِي ذَلِكَ لآيَةً لَّكُمْ إِن كُنْتُم مُّؤْمِنِينَ,And their prophet said to them after they had demanded a sign of his kingship ‘The sign of his kingship is that there will come to you the Ark a chest containing the images of the prophets which God sent down to Adam and which was handed down to them sc. the Israelites until the Amalekites seized it from them in battle. They used to commence fighting invoking it before their enemy and marching behind it as well as experience peacefulness in its presence as God says therein is a Spirit of Peace reassurance for your hearts from your Lord and a remnant of what the folk of Moses and the folk of Aaron left behind which were Moses’s pair of sandals and his staff Aaron’s turban a measure qafīz of the manna that used to come down on them and the pieces of the broken tablets the angels bearing it tahmiluhu l-malā’ikatu the circumstantial qualifier referring to the subject of the verb ya’tiyakum ‘there will come to’. Surely in that shall be a sign for you of his kingship if you are believers’. The angels bore it between the earth and the sky while they gazed at it until finally they placed it before Saul. They then acknowledged his kingship and hastened to enlist in the holy struggle and he chose seventy thousand of their young men.
فَلَمَّا فَصَلَ طَالُوتُ بِٱلْجُنُودِ قَالَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ مُبْتَلِيكُمْ بِنَهَرٍ فَمَن شَرِبَ مِنْهُ فَلَيْسَ مِنِّي وَمَن لَّمْ يَطْعَمْهُ فَإِنَّهُ مِنِّيۤ إِلاَّ مَنِ ٱغْتَرَفَ غُرْفَةً بِيَدِهِ فَشَرِبُواْ مِنْهُ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً مِّنْهُمْ فَلَمَّا جَاوَزَهُ هُوَ وَٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ مَعَهُ قَالُواْ لاَ طَاقَةَ لَنَا ٱلْيَوْمَ بِجَالُوتَ وَجُنودِهِ قَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ يَظُنُّونَ أَنَّهُمْ مُلاَقُواْ ٱللَّهِ كَم مِّن فِئَةٍ قَلِيلَةٍ غَلَبَتْ فِئَةً كَثِيرَةً بِإِذْنِ ٱللَّهِ وَٱللَّهُ مَعَ ٱلصَّابِرِينَ,And when Saul went forth with the hosts from the Holy House sc. Jerusalem the heat was intense and so they asked him for water; he said ‘God will try test you in order to distinguish the obedient among you from the disobedient with a river between Jordan and Palestine whoever drinks of it of its water is not of me is not of my followers and whoever tastes it not he is of me except for him who scoops up with his hand’ ghurfa or gharfa ‘a scoop’ satisfying himself therewith and not taking more he is also of my followers. But they drank of it when they reached it and saw that it was abundant except a few of them who restricted themselves to a scoop it is reported that one scoop was enough for each man and his horse and they numbered over three hundred; and when he crossed it with those who believed the ones who confined themselves to the one scoop they the ones that drank profusely said ‘We have no power today against Goliath and his troops’ that is no power to fight them and they were cowardly and did not cross it. Those who thought with certainty that they would meet God at the Resurrection and these were the ones that crossed it said ‘How often kam ‘how’ functions as a predicate meaning kathīr ‘many’ a little company group of men has overcome a numerous one by God’s leave by His will; and God is with the patient’ providing them with help and assistance.
وَلَمَّا بَرَزُواْ لِجَالُوتَ وَجُنُودِهِ قَالُواْ رَبَّنَآ أَفْرِغْ عَلَيْنَا صَبْراً وَثَبِّتْ أَقْدَامَنَا وَٱنْصُرْنَا عَلَى ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلْكَافِرِينَ,So when they went forth against Goliath and his troops facing them in military columns they said ‘Our Lord pour out upon us patience and make firm our feet by strengthening our hearts for this struggle and grant us victory over the disbelieving folk!’
فَهَزَمُوهُمْ بِإِذْنِ ٱللَّهِ وَقَتَلَ دَاوُدُ جَالُوتَ وَآتَاهُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْمُلْكَ وَٱلْحِكْمَةَ وَعَلَّمَهُ مِمَّا يَشَآءُ وَلَوْلاَ دَفْعُ ٱللَّهِ ٱلنَّاسَ بَعْضَهُمْ بِبَعْضٍ لَفَسَدَتِ ٱلأَرْضُ وَلَـٰكِنَّ ٱللَّهَ ذُو فَضْلٍ عَلَى ٱلْعَالَمِينَ,And they routed they broke them by the leave of God by His will and David who was among the ranks of Saul’s army slew Goliath; and God gave him David the kingship over the Children of Israel and Wisdom prophethood after the death of Samuel and Saul and the combination of kingship and prophethood had never come to anyone before him; and He taught him such as He willed of the manufacture of mail-coats and the speech of birds. Had God not repelled people some ba‘dahum ‘some’ substitutes for saying ba‘dan min al-nās ‘some people’ by means of others the earth would have surely been corrupted with idolaters defeating and slaying Muslims and mosques being destroyed; but God is bounteous to all worlds by repelling some by means of others.
تِلْكَ آيَاتُ ٱللَّهِ نَتْلُوهَا عَلَيْكَ بِٱلْحَقِّ وَإِنَّكَ لَمِنَ ٱلْمُرْسَلِينَ,These verses are the verses of God We recite to you O Muhammad (s) as narration in truth and assuredly you are one of the Messengers of God the emphasis is made here with the particle inna of innaka ‘surely you are’ with the remainder of the statement being a rebuttal of the disbelievers’ saying ‘You are no Messenger’.
تِلْكَ ٱلرُّسُلُ فَضَّلْنَا بَعْضَهُمْ عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ مِّنْهُمْ مَّن كَلَّمَ ٱللَّهُ وَرَفَعَ بَعْضَهُمْ دَرَجَاتٍ وَآتَيْنَا عِيسَى ٱبْنَ مَرْيَمَ ٱلْبَيِّنَاتِ وَأَيَّدْنَاهُ بِرُوحِ ٱلْقُدُسِ وَلَوْ شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ مَا ٱقْتَتَلَ ٱلَّذِينَ مِن بَعْدِهِم مِّن بَعْدِ مَا جَآءَتْهُمُ ٱلْبَيِّنَاتُ وَلَـٰكِنِ ٱخْتَلَفُواْ فَمِنْهُمْ مَّنْ آمَنَ وَمِنْهُمْ مَّن كَفَرَ وَلَوْ شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ مَا ٱقْتَتَلُواْ وَلَـٰكِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَفْعَلُ مَا يُرِيدُ,Those tilka is the subject messengers al-rusul is either an adjective or the predicate some We have preferred above others by assigning a particular trait to one not found in the other; some there are to whom God spoke such as Moses and some He raised in rank namely Muhammad (s) on account of his call being to all peoples his being the Seal of the Prophets on account of the superiority of his community to all others the sundry miracles and the many special qualities. And We gave Jesus son of Mary the clear proofs and confirmed him strengthened him with the Holy Spirit namely Gabriel who would accompany him wherever he went. And had God willed that all people be guided those who came after them after the messengers that is their communities would not have fought against one another after the clear proofs had come to them because of their disagreement and their leading one another astray; but they fell into variance as He willed and some of them believed and adhered firmly to his faith and some disbelieved as the Christians did after Jesus al-Masīh and had God willed they would not have fought against one another repeated here for emphasis but God does whatever He desires giving success to whomever He will and disappointment to whomever He will.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُوۤاْ أَنْفِقُواْ مِمَّا رَزَقْنَٰكُم مِّن قَبْلِ أَن يَأْتِيَ يَوْمٌ لاَّ بَيْعٌ فِيهِ وَلاَ خُلَّةٌ وَلاَ شَفَاعَةٌ وَٱلْكَٰفِرُونَ هُمُ ٱلظَّٰلِمُونَ,O you who believe expend of what We have provided you with what is due of it as alms before there comes a day in which there shall be neither commerce ransom nor friendship that can be of any benefit nor intercession without His permission a variant reading has all three nouns in nominative inflection bay‘un khullatun shafā‘atun as opposed to lā bay‘a lā khullata lā shafā‘ata this is the Day of Resurrection. And the disbelievers those that disbelieve in God or in the obligations He has imposed on them — they are the evildoers for not respecting God’s command.
ٱللَّهُ لاَ إِلَـٰهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ ٱلْحَيُّ ٱلْقَيُّومُ لاَ تَأْخُذُهُ سِنَةٌ وَلاَ نَوْمٌ لَّهُ مَا فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِي ٱلأَرْضِ مَن ذَا ٱلَّذِي يَشْفَعُ عِنْدَهُ إِلاَّ بِإِذْنِهِ يَعْلَمُ مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ وَلاَ يُحِيطُونَ بِشَيْءٍ مِّنْ عِلْمِهِ إِلاَّ بِمَا شَآءَ وَسِعَ كُرْسِيُّهُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضَ وَلاَ يَؤُودُهُ حِفْظُهُمَا وَهُوَ ٱلْعَلِيُّ ٱلْعَظِيمُ,God there is no god that is there is none worthy of being worshipped in all existence except Him the Living the Everlasting the Eternal Sustainer the One constantly engaged in the management of His creation. Slumber does not seize Him neither sleep; to Him belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth as possessions creatures and servants; who is there that is to say none is there that shall intercede with Him save by His leave? in this for him. He knows what lies before them that is creation and what is after them of the affairs of this world and the Hereafter; and they encompass nothing of His knowledge that is they know nothing of what He knows save such as He wills to inform of it by way of His messengers. His throne subsumes the heavens and the earth it is said that His knowledge encompasses them both; it is also said that the kursī ‘throne’ itself subsumes them on account of its vastness as in the hadīth ‘The seven heavens compared to the kursī are like seven silver coins lying in a metal shield of armour’; the preserving of them the heavens and the earth wearies Him not does not burden Him; He is the Sublime above His creation by virtue of His subjugation of them the Tremendous the Great.
لاَ إِكْرَاهَ فِي ٱلدِّينِ قَد تَّبَيَّنَ ٱلرُّشْدُ مِنَ ٱلْغَيِّ فَمَنْ يَكْفُرْ بِٱلطَّاغُوتِ وَيْؤْمِن بِٱللَّهِ فَقَدِ ٱسْتَمْسَكَ بِٱلْعُرْوَةِ ٱلْوُثْقَىٰ لاَ ٱنفِصَامَ لَهَا وَٱللَّهُ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ,There is no compulsion in entering into religion. Rectitude has become clear from error that is say through clear proofs it has become manifest that faith is rectitude and disbelief is error this was revealed concerning the Ansār of Medina who tried to compel their sons to enter into Islam; so whoever disbelieves in the false deity namely Satan or idols tāghūt ‘false deity’ is used in a singular and plural sense and believes in God has laid hold of the most firm handle the tight knot unbreaking that cannot be severed; God is Hearing of what is said Knowing of what is done.
ٱللَّهُ وَلِيُّ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ يُخْرِجُهُمْ مِّنَ ٱلظُّلُمَاتِ إِلَى ٱلنُّورِ وَٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوۤاْ أَوْلِيَآؤُهُمُ ٱلطَّاغُوتُ يُخْرِجُونَهُمْ مِّنَ ٱلنُّورِ إِلَى ٱلظُّلُمَاتِ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ أَصْحَابُ ٱلنَّارِ هُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ,God is the Protector helper of the believers; He brings them forth from the shadows of unbelief into the light of faith. And the disbelievers — their protectors are false deities that bring them forth from the light into the shadows the repetition of ‘bringing forth from’ here is either to be taken as a reflection of His previous words “He brings them forth from the shadows” or as a reference to all those Jews who believed in the Prophet before he was sent but then rejected him those are the inhabitants of the Fire therein they shall abide.
أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى ٱلَّذِي حَآجَّ إِبْرَاهِيمَ فِي رَبِّهِ أَنْ آتَاهُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْمُلْكَ إِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ رَبِّيَ ٱلَّذِي يُحْيِـي وَيُمِيتُ قَالَ أَنَا أُحْيِـي وَأُمِيتُ قَالَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَأْتِي بِٱلشَّمْسِ مِنَ ٱلْمَشْرِقِ فَأْتِ بِهَا مِنَ ٱلْمَغْرِبِ فَبُهِتَ ٱلَّذِي كَفَرَ وَٱللَّهُ لاَ يَهْدِي ٱلْقَوْمَ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ,Have you not seen him who disputed with Abraham concerning his Lord because of the fact that God had given him the kingship? that is his arrogance towards this very grace of God this was Nimrod Nimrūd. When idh is a substitution for hājja ‘disputed’ Abraham in response to the other’s question ‘Who is this Lord of yours to whom you are calling us?’ said ‘My Lord is He who gives life and makes to die’ the One that creates life and death in bodies; he Nimrod said ‘I give life by sparing and make to die’ by killing. He then had two men brought before him killed one and spared the other. When Abraham realised that this man was a fool Abraham resorting to a more sophisticated argument said ‘God brings the sun from the east; so bring you it from the west.’ Then the disbeliever was confused perplexed and amazed; and God guides not the folk who do evil disbelieving to the art of argument.
أَوْ كَٱلَّذِي مَرَّ عَلَىٰ قَرْيَةٍ وَهِيَ خَاوِيَةٌ عَلَىٰ عُرُوشِهَا قَالَ أَنَّىٰ يُحْيِـي هَـٰذِهِ ٱللَّهُ بَعْدَ مَوْتِهَا فَأَمَاتَهُ ٱللَّهُ مِئَةَ عَامٍ ثُمَّ بَعَثَهُ قَالَ كَمْ لَبِثْتَ قَالَ لَبِثْتُ يَوْماً أَوْ بَعْضَ يَوْمٍ قَالَ بَل لَّبِثْتَ مِئَةَ عَامٍ فَٱنْظُرْ إِلَىٰ طَعَامِكَ وَشَرَابِكَ لَمْ يَتَسَنَّهْ وَٱنْظُرْ إِلَىٰ حِمَارِكَ وَلِنَجْعَلَكَ آيَةً لِلنَّاسِ وَٱنْظُرْ إِلَى ٱلعِظَامِ كَيْفَ نُنْشِزُهَا ثُمَّ نَكْسُوهَا لَحْماً فَلَمَّا تَبَيَّنَ لَهُ قَالَ أَعْلَمُ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,Or did you see such as he Ezra ‘Uzayr who the kāf of ka’lladhī ‘such as he who’ is extra passed by a city namely the Holy House sc. Jerusalem riding on an ass and carrying with him a basket of figs and a cup of juice a city that was fallen down collapsed upon its turrets its roof tops after Nebuchadnezzar had destroyed it; he said ‘How annā means kayfa ‘how’ shall God give life to this now that it is dead?’ challenging the power of the exalted One so God made him die and remain dead for a hundred years then he raised him up brought him back to life to show him how this could be done; He God said ‘How long have you tarried?’ been here?; he said ‘I have tarried a day or part of a day’ because he fell asleep before noon and was made dead and then brought back to life again at sunset and thus he thought it was a day’s sleep; He said ‘Nay; you have tarried a hundred years. Look at your food the figs and drink the cup of juice it has not spoiled despite the length of time the final hā’ of yatasannah ‘to spoil’ is said to belong to the original root s-n-h; but it is also said to be silent in which case the root would be s-n-y; a variant reading omits the final hā’; and look at your ass how it is and he saw that it had died and all that remained were its withered white bones. We did this so that you would know and so that We would make you a sign of the truth of the Resurrection for the people. And look at the bones of the ass how We shall set them up how We shall raise them back to life nunshiruhā or nanshiruhā derived from the two expressions nashara and anshara; a variant reading has nunshizuhā meaning ‘How We shall move it and make it stand’; and then clothe them with flesh’ and when he looked at it he saw that the bones had been reconstituted and clothed with flesh and that the Spirit had been breathed into it making it bray. So when it was made clear to him as a result of witnessing it he said ‘I know a variant reading for a‘lam ‘I know’ has the imperative i‘lam ‘know!’ thus making it a command from God with the knowledge of direct vision that God has power over all things’.
وَإِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ رَبِّ أَرِنِي كَيْفَ تُحْيِـي ٱلْمَوْتَىٰ قَالَ أَوَلَمْ تُؤْمِن قَالَ بَلَىٰ وَلَـكِن لِّيَطْمَئِنَّ قَلْبِي قَالَ فَخُذْ أَرْبَعَةً مِّنَ ٱلطَّيْرِ فَصُرْهُنَّ إِلَيْكَ ثُمَّ ٱجْعَلْ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ جَبَلٍ مِّنْهُنَّ جُزْءًا ثُمَّ ٱدْعُهُنَّ يَأْتِينَكَ سَعْياً وَٱعْلَمْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ,And mention when Abraham said ‘My Lord show me how You give life to the dead’ He God exalted be He said to him ‘Why do you not believe?’ in My power to revive; God asks him this even though He knows of his belief in this power as a response to his request and so that the ones listening will know the purpose of the request; ‘Yes’ I do believe he said ‘but I ask You so that my heart may be re-assured’ so that it may be at peace through direct vision in addition to that certainty which is sought through logical reasoning. Said He ‘Take four birds and twist them to you sirhunna or surhunna turn them towards you cut them up and mix together their flesh and feathers then set a part of them on every hill in the land around you then summon them to you and they will come to you in haste. And know that God is Mighty that nothing is beyond Him Wise’ in His actions. Abraham took a peacock an eagle a raven and a cock and did with them as has been mentioned but kept their heads with him. He called them and all the parts began to fly back together combining until they were whole and returning to their heads.
مَّثَلُ ٱلَّذِينَ يُنْفِقُونَ أَمْوَالَهُمْ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ كَمَثَلِ حَبَّةٍ أَنبَتَتْ سَبْعَ سَنَابِلَ فِي كُلِّ سُنبُلَةٍ مِّئَةُ حَبَّةٍ وَٱللَّهُ يُضَاعِفُ لِمَن يَشَآءُ وَٱللَّهُ وَاسِعٌ عَلِيمٌ,The likeness of the quality of the expenditure of those who expend their wealth in the way of God that is in obedience of Him is as the likeness of a grain of corn that sprouts seven ears in every ear a hundred grains likewise what they expend will be multiplied seven hundred times; so God multiplies even more than this for whom He will; God is Embracing in His bounty Knowing those who deserve such multiplications.
ٱلَّذِينَ يُنْفِقُونَ أَمْوَالَهُمْ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ ثُمَّ لاَ يُتْبِعُونَ مَآ أَنْفَقُواُ مَنّاً وَلاَ أَذًى لَّهُمْ أَجْرُهُمْ عِنْدَ رَبِّهِمْ وَلاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلاَ هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ,Those who expend their wealth in the way of God then do not follow up their expenditure with reminder of their generosity of the one on whom they expended for example by saying ‘I was good to him and restored his affairs’; and injury to that person by mentioning this to people whom he would prefer not to know about it; their wage the reward for their expenditure is with their Lord and no fear shall befall them neither shall they grieve in the Hereafter.
قَوْلٌ مَّعْرُوفٌ وَمَغْفِرَةٌ خَيْرٌ مِّن صَدَقَةٍ يَتْبَعُهَآ أَذًى وَٱللَّهُ غَنِيٌّ حَلِيمٌ,Honourable words kind talk and a generous reply to the beggar and forgiveness towards him for his persistence are better than a voluntary almsgiving followed by injury through reproach and deriding him for his begging; and God is Independent of the voluntary almsgiving of His servants Forbearing in His delaying the punishment of the reproachful and injurious one.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ لاَ تُبْطِلُواْ صَدَقَٰتِكُم بِٱلْمَنِّ وَٱلأَذَىٰ كَٱلَّذِي يُنْفِقُ مَالَهُ رِئَآءَ ٱلنَّاسِ وَلاَ يُؤْمِنُ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلآخِرِ فَمَثَلُهُ كَمَثَلِ صَفْوَانٍ عَلَيْهِ تُرَابٌ فَأَصَابَهُ وَابِلٌ فَتَرَكَهُ صَلْداً لاَّ يَقْدِرُونَ عَلَىٰ شَيْءٍ مِّمَّا كَسَبُواْ وَٱللَّهُ لاَ يَهْدِي ٱلْقَوْمَ ٱلْكَافِرِينَ,O you who believe annul not the rewards of your voluntary almsgivings with reproach and injury as in the manner of the annulment of the expenditure of one who expends of his substance to show off to men and believes not in God and the Last Day this is the hypocrite. The likeness of him is as the likeness of a smooth rock on which is soil and a torrent of intense rain smites it and leaves it barren and smooth with nothing on it. They have no power lā yaqdirūna is a resumption of the statement about the likeness of the one that expends for show; the person becomes plural on account of the potential plural implication of alladhī ‘the one who’ over anything that they have earned that they did in other words they find no reward for it in the Hereafter just as one finds nothing of the dust that was on the surface of the smooth rock after the rain has washed it away. God guides not the disbelieving folk.
وَمَثَلُ ٱلَّذِينَ يُنْفِقُونَ أَمْوٰلَهُمُ ٱبْتِغَآءَ مَرْضَاتِ ٱللَّهِ وَتَثْبِيتاً مِّنْ أَنْفُسِهِمْ كَمَثَلِ جَنَّةٍ بِرَبْوَةٍ أَصَابَهَا وَابِلٌ فَآتَتْ أُكُلَهَا ضِعْفَيْنِ فَإِن لَّمْ يُصِبْهَا وَابِلٌ فَطَلٌّ وَٱللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ,But the likeness of the expenditure of those who expend their wealth seeking God’s good pleasure and to confirm themselves that is to realise the reward thereof in contrast to the hypocrites who do not hope for it since they do not believe in it is as the likeness of a garden an orchard upon a hill read rabwa or rubwa a high ground; a torrent smites it and it yields gives forth its produce read ukulahā or uklahā its fruits twofold twice the fruits of another garden; if no torrent smites it then dew tall a light drizzle which falls on it and suffices it on account of its altitude. In other words it grows and bears fruit regardless of how much rain falls; likewise are the expenditures of those mentioned they will increase with God regardless of how much they were; and God sees what you do and He will requite you for it.
أَيَوَدُّ أَحَدُكُمْ أَن تَكُونَ لَهُ جَنَّةٌ مِّن نَّخِيلٍ وَأَعْنَابٍ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلأَنْهَارُ لَهُ فِيهَا مِن كُلِّ ٱلثَّمَرَاتِ وَأَصَابَهُ ٱلْكِبَرُ وَلَهُ ذُرِّيَّةٌ ضُعَفَآءُ فَأَصَابَهَآ إِعْصَارٌ فِيهِ نَارٌ فَٱحْتَرَقَتْ كَذَلِكَ يُبَيِّنُ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمُ ٱلأيَٰتِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَفَكَّرُونَ,Would any of you wish to have a garden an orchard of date-palms and vines with rivers flowing beneath it for him there is in it all manner of fruit then old age smites him and makes him too weak to profit from it and he has seed but they are weak young children who cannot manage it; then a whirlwind i‘sār are violent winds with fire smites it and it is consumed? so that he loses what he is most in need of and now he and his children have become incapacitated confused without any resources. This is a similitude of how the expenditure of the one expending for show or the one who reproaches after having expended vanishes and how it is of no avail when he will be most in need of it in the Hereafter the interrogative a-yawaddu ‘would any wish’ is intended as a denial. According to Ibn ‘Abbās this is the person who performs deeds of obedience but when Satan comes to him he begins to work disobedience until all his good deeds have been consumed. So in the way that He has explained what has been mentioned God makes clear the signs to you so that you might reflect and take heed.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُوۤاْ أَنْفِقُواْ مِن طَيِّبَاتِ مَا كَسَبْتُمْ وَمِمَّآ أَخْرَجْنَا لَكُم مِّنَ ٱلأَرْضِ وَلاَ تَيَمَّمُواْ ٱلْخَبِيثَ مِنْهُ تُنْفِقُونَ وَلَسْتُمْ بِآخِذِيهِ إِلاَّ أَن تُغْمِضُواْ فِيهِ وَٱعْلَمُوۤاْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَنِيٌّ حَمِيدٌ,O you who believe expend of that is to say purify the good things you have earned of property and the good things of what We have produced for you from the earth of grains and fruits and seek not lā tayammamū means lā taqsudū the corrupt the vile of it the above-mentioned for your expending it as alms tunfiqūna ‘you expend’ is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the person of the verb tayammamū ‘seek’; for you would never take it the vile part yourselves if you were given it as something due to you; without closing your eyes to it by being careless and mindless so how do you expect to give what is due to God from this?; and know that God is Independent of your expenditures Laudable praised in every situation.
ٱلشَّيْطَانُ يَعِدُكُمُ ٱلْفَقْرَ وَيَأْمُرُكُم بِٱلْفَحْشَآءِ وَٱللَّهُ يَعِدُكُم مَّغْفِرَةً مِّنْهُ وَفَضْلاً وَٱللَّهُ وَاسِعٌ عَلِيمٌ,Satan promises you poverty by making you fear loss when you make a voluntary almsgiving and so you withhold it and enjoins you to indecency niggardliness and the impeding of almsgiving; but God promises you in return for your expenditure His pardon for your sins and His bounty as sustenance from Him; and God is Embracing in His bounty Knowing the one who expends.
يُؤْتِي الْحِكْمَةَ مَن يَشَآءُ وَمَن يُؤْتَ الْحِكْمَةَ فَقَدْ أُوتِيَ خَيْراً كَثِيراً وَمَا يَذَّكَّرُ إِلاَّ أُوْلُواْ ٱلأَلْبَابِ,He gives wisdom that is the profitable knowledge that leads to righteous action to whomever He will and he who is given wisdom has been given much good because he will end up in perpetual bliss; yet none remembers the tā’ of yadhdhakkar has been assimilated with the dhāl that is to say none is admonished but the people of pith possessors of intellects.
وَمَآ أَنفَقْتُمْ مِّن نَّفَقَةٍ أَوْ نَذَرْتُمْ مِّن نَّذْرٍ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَعْلَمُهُ وَمَا لِلظَّالِمِينَ مِنْ أَنْصَارٍ,And whatever expenditure you expend be it as alms or a voluntary almsgiving and whatever vow you make and fulfil surely God knows it and will requite you for it. For the evildoers who prevent almsgiving and vows or expend other than the way they should in disobedience to God they have no helpers to protect them from His chastisement.
إِن تُبْدُواْ ٱلصَّدَقَاتِ فَنِعِمَّا هِيَ وَإِن تُخْفُوهَا وَتُؤْتُوهَا ٱلْفُقَرَآءَ فَهُوَ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ وَيُكَفِّرُ عَنكُم مِّن سَيِّئَاتِكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيرٌ,If you proclaim make manifest your voluntary almsgivings that is your supererogatory deeds it is a fine thing to show them; but if you conceal them and give them to the poor that is even better for you than making them manifest or giving it to the rich. As regards the obligatory almsgiving it is better to make it manifest so that it serves as an example and so that one is not accused falsely of not giving; as regards giving it to the poor this is obligatory; and it will absolve you of some of your evil deeds read yukaffir ‘it will absolve’ or nukaffir ‘We will absolve’ either in apocopated form with no final vowel yukaffir nukaffir being a supplement to the locus of fa-huwa ‘that is’ or with nominative inflection yukaffiru nukaffiru indicating the beginning of a new sentence. God is aware of what you do knowing its inner and outer aspects nothing of it being hidden from Him.
لَّيْسَ عَلَيْكَ هُدَاهُمْ وَلَـٰكِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَهْدِي مَن يَشَآءُ وَمَا تُنْفِقُواْ مِنْ خَيْرٍ فَلأَنْفُسِكُمْ وَمَا تُنْفِقُونَ إِلاَّ ٱبْتِغَآءَ وَجْهِ ٱللَّهِ وَمَا تُنْفِقُواْ مِنْ خَيْرٍ يُوَفَّ إِلَيْكُمْ وَأَنْتُمْ لاَ تُظْلَمُونَ,When the Prophet s was prohibited from giving voluntary alms to idolaters as an incentive for them to embrace Islam the following was revealed You are not responsible for guiding them that is to say for people that they should embrace Islam you are responsible only for conveying the Message to them; but God guides with His guidance whomever He will to embrace Islam. And whatever good property you expend is for yourselves since the reward is for you; for then you are expending desiring only God’s Face this clause is the predicate denoting a prohibition that is to say His reward and not any other transient object of this world and whatever good you expend its requital shall be repaid to you in full and you will not be wronged you will not suffer any diminishment of it both of the last two sentences emphasise the first one.
لِلْفُقَرَآءِ ٱلَّذِينَ أُحصِرُواْ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ لاَ يَسْتَطِيعُونَ ضَرْباً فِي ٱلأَرْضِ يَحْسَبُهُمُ ٱلْجَاهِلُ أَغْنِيَآءَ مِنَ ٱلتَّعَفُّفِ تَعْرِفُهُم بِسِيمَاهُمْ لاَ يَسْأَلُونَ ٱلنَّاسَ إِلْحَافاً وَمَا تُنفِقُواْ مِنْ خَيْرٍ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ بِهِ عَلِيمٌ,For the poor this is the predicate of the missing subject al-sadaqāt ‘voluntary almsgiving’ who are constrained in the way of God those who have confined themselves in preparation for the struggle this was revealed concerning the people of Suffa consisting in some four hundred of the Emigrants muhājirūn set apart from the other Muslims for the study of the Qur’ān and to take part in raids; and they are unable to journey darban means safaran in the land to engage in commerce and earn their living since they are fully engaged in the struggle; the ignorant man supposes them on account of the way they behave rich because of their abstinence that is their refraining from asking for things; but you the one being addressed shall know them by their mark by the signs of their humility and exertion; they do not beg of men and make urgent demands importunately that is to say they do not beg in the first place so there is no question of persistence. And whatever good you expend surely God has knowledge of it and will requite it accordingly.
ٱلَّذِينَ يُنْفِقُونَ أَمْوَالَهُمْ بِٱللَّيْلِ وَٱلنَّهَارِ سِرّاً وَعَلاَنِيَةً فَلَهُمْ أَجْرُهُمْ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ وَلاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلاَ هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ,Those who expend their wealth night and day secretly and openly their wage awaits them with their Lord and no fear shall befall them neither shall they grieve.
ٱلَّذِينَ يَأْكُلُونَ ٱلرِّبَٰواْ لاَ يَقُومُونَ إِلاَّ كَمَا يَقُومُ ٱلَّذِي يَتَخَبَّطُهُ ٱلشَّيْطَانُ مِنَ ٱلْمَسِّ ذَلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ قَالُوۤاْ إِنَّمَا ٱلْبَيْعُ مِثْلُ ٱلرِّبَٰواْ وَأَحَلَّ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْبَيْعَ وَحَرَّمَ ٱلرِّبَٰواْ فَمَن جَآءَهُ مَوْعِظَةٌ مِّنْ رَّبِّهِ فَٱنْتَهَىٰ فَلَهُ مَا سَلَفَ وَأَمْرُهُ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ وَمَنْ عَادَ فَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ أَصْحَابُ ٱلنَّارِ هُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ,Those who devour that is those who seize by way of usury which is an excess levied in transactions of money or foodstuffs either on their value or on credit shall not rise again from their graves except rising as one whom Satan has made prostrate demented from touch through madness min al-mass ‘from touch’ is semantically connected to yaqūmūna ‘they rise’; that which befalls them is because of the fact that they say ‘Trade is like usury’ in terms of permissibility this statement is a type of reversed simile used for intensity sc. ‘usury is like trade’ is the expected word order. God responds to them saying that God has permitted trade and forbidden usury. Whoever receives an admonition from his Lord and desists from devouring it he shall have his past gains those made before the prohibition and which cannot be reclaimed from him and his affair with regard to pardoning him is committed to God; but whoever reverts to devouring it treating it like trade in terms of lawfulness — those are the inhabitants of the Fire abiding therein.
يَمْحَقُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلرِّبَٰواْ وَيُرْبِي ٱلصَّدَقَٰتِ وَٱللَّهُ لاَ يُحِبُّ كُلَّ كَفَّارٍ أَثِيمٍ,God effaces usury diminishing it and eliminating any blessing in it but He augments voluntary almsgivings with interest increasing them making them grow and multiplying their reward. God loves not that is to say He will requite any guilty profligate devouring it ingrate who deems usury licit.
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ وَأَقَامُواْ ٱلصَّلَٰوةَ وَآتَوُاْ ٱلزَّكَٰوةَ لَهُمْ أَجْرُهُمْ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ وَلاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلاَ هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ,Those who believe and perform righteous deeds and establish the prayer and pay the alms — their wage awaits them with their Lord and no fear shall befall them neither shall they grieve.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ ٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَذَرُواْ مَا بَقِيَ مِنَ ٱلرِّبَٰواْ إِن كُنْتُمْ مُّؤْمِنِينَ,O you who believe fear God and give up abandon the usury that is outstanding if you are believers true to your faith since it is expected of the believer that he adhere to God’s command this was revealed when some of the Companions after the prohibition wanted to reclaim some of the usury from before.
فَإِن لَّمْ تَفْعَلُواْ فَأْذَنُواْ بِحَرْبٍ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ وَإِنْ تُبْتُمْ فَلَكُمْ رُؤُوسُ أَمْوَٰلِكُمْ لاَ تَظْلِمُونَ وَلاَ تُظْلَمُونَ,But if you do not do what you have been commanded then be warned have knowledge of war from God and His Messenger against you herein is a grave threat for them. When it was revealed they said ‘What power can we have in a war against Him!’ Yet if you repent and forgo it you shall have your principal sums the original amounts not being unjust by charging interest and no injustice being done to you by way of any diminution.
وَإِن كَانَ ذُو عُسْرَةٍ فَنَظِرَةٌ إِلَىٰ مَيْسَرَةٍ وَأَن تَصَدَّقُواْ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ إِن كُنْتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ,And if any man in debt should be in difficulties then let him have respite a postponement till things are easier read maysara or maysura meaning ‘a time of ease’; but that you should give tassaddaqū where the second tā’ of the softened form tatasaddaqū has been assimilated with the sād the one in difficulty a voluntary almsgiving by waiving his debt is better for you did you but know if you know that it is better for you then do it. In a hadīth it is said ‘Whoever gives respite to one in difficulty or waives his debt God will place him under His shade on a day when there shall be no shade except God’s’ as reported by Muslim.
وَٱتَّقُواْ يَوْماً تُرْجَعُونَ فِيهِ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ ثُمَّ تُوَفَّىٰ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ مَّا كَسَبَتْ وَهُمْ لاَ يُظْلَمُونَ,And fear a day wherein you shall be returned to God namely the Day of Resurrection read the passive turja‘ūna meaning ‘you shall be returned’ or the active tarji‘ūna meaning ‘you shall return’ and every soul on that day shall be paid in full the requital of what it has earned what it has done of good or evil; and they shall not be wronged through any loss of a good deed or the incurring of an extra evil deed.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُوۤاْ إِذَا تَدَايَنتُم بِدَيْنٍ إِلَىٰ أَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّى فَٱكْتُبُوهُ وَلْيَكْتُب بَّيْنَكُمْ كَاتِبٌ بِٱلْعَدْلِ وَلاَ يَأْبَ كَاتِبٌ أَنْ يَكْتُبَ كَمَا عَلَّمَهُ ٱللَّهُ فَلْيَكْتُبْ وَلْيُمْلِلِ ٱلَّذِي عَلَيْهِ ٱلْحَقُّ وَلْيَتَّقِ ٱللَّهَ رَبَّهُ وَلاَ يَبْخَسْ مِنْهُ شَيْئاً فَإن كَانَ ٱلَّذِي عَلَيْهِ ٱلْحَقُّ سَفِيهاً أَوْ ضَعِيفاً أَوْ لاَ يَسْتَطِيعُ أَن يُمِلَّ هُوَ فَلْيُمْلِلْ وَلِيُّهُ بِٱلْعَدْلِ وَٱسْتَشْهِدُواْ شَهِيدَيْنِ مِّن رِّجَالِكُمْ فَإِن لَّمْ يَكُونَا رَجُلَيْنِ فَرَجُلٌ وَٱمْرَأَتَانِ مِمَّن تَرْضَوْنَ مِنَ ٱلشُّهَدَآءِ أَن تَضِلَّ إِحْدَاهُمَا فَتُذَكِّرَ إِحْدَاهُمَا ٱلأُخْرَىٰ وَلاَ يَأْبَ ٱلشُّهَدَآءُ إِذَا مَا دُعُواْ وَلاَ تَسْأَمُوۤاْ أَن تَكْتُبُوهُ صَغِيراً أَو كَبِيراً إِلَىٰ أَجَلِهِ ذَلِكُمْ أَقْسَطُ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ وَأَقْومُ لِلشَّهَٰدَةِ وَأَدْنَىٰ أَلاَّ تَرْتَابُوۤاْ إِلاَّ أَن تَكُونَ تِجَٰرَةً حَاضِرَةً تُدِيرُونَهَا بَيْنَكُمْ فَلَيْسَ عَلَيْكُمْ جُنَاحٌ أَلاَّ تَكْتُبُوهَا وَأَشْهِدُوۤاْ إِذَا تَبَايَعْتُمْ وَلاَ يُضَآرَّ كَاتِبٌ وَلاَ شَهِيدٌ وَإِن تَفْعَلُواْ فَإِنَّهُ فُسُوقٌ بِكُمْ وَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَيُعَلِّمُكُمُ ٱللَّهُ وَٱللَّهُ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عَلِيمٌ,O you who believe when you contract when you are dealing with a debt such as in prepayment for future delivery of goods or a loan one upon another for a stated a known term write it down as confirmation and security against any dispute; and let a writer write it the contract of debt down between you justly accurately not increasing or decreasing the amount or the terms; and let not any writer refuse to write it down if he is requested for such a task as God has taught him the kāf of ka-mā ‘as’ is semantically connected to the verb ya’ba ‘refuse’ that is just as He has given him the advantage of knowing how to write he should not be niggardly in this respect; so let him write repeated for emphasis and let the debtor dictate to the one writing the contract for he is the one being witnessed and must be fully aware of his obligations; and let him fear God his Lord when dictating and not diminish anything of it of the debt due. And if the debtor be a fool a squanderer or weak not up to dictating on account of old age or immaturity or unable to dictate himself on account of being dumb or not knowing the language and so forth then let his guardian the one in charge of his affairs be it a parent an executor a custodian or an interpreter dictate justly. And summon to bear witness the debt two witnesses men mature Muslim free men; or if the two witnesses be not men then one man and two women to bear witness such witnesses as you approve of on account of their piety and probity; the number of women is because of the fact so that if one of the two women errs forgets the testimony given their lesser astuteness and accuracy; the other the one remembering will remind her read fa-tudhakkira or fa-tudhkira the one that has forgotten — the ‘reminding’ clause is the reason for the choice of two women that is to say so that she may be reminded if she errs or strays into error because this forgetfulness is the cause of it a variant reading for an ‘that’ has the conditional in ‘if’ with the verb inflected as tudhakkiru ‘she will remind’ making it a new sentence the response to which follows; and let the witnesses not refuse whenever the mā of idhā mā ‘whenever’ is extra they are summoned to bear witness and take responsibility for the testimony; and be not disdainful lazy to write it down that which you have witnessed in truth for this frequently occurred be it small or great a little or much with its term that is the date on which it is due ilā ajlihi is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the pronominal suffix hā’ of taktubū-hu ‘you write it down’; that writing down is more equitable more just in God’s sight more upright for testimony that is to say that is more helpful in summoning witness because it contains the reminder; and nearer closer to attaining the desired state that you will not be in doubt with regard to the amount and the due dates; unless it be that there is trade carried out there and then tijāratun hādiratun a variant reading has tijāratan hādiratan in which case the nominal sentence is missing its subject and must be the pronoun for tijāra ‘trade’ that is hiya ‘it fem.
وَإِن كُنتُمْ عَلَىٰ سَفَرٍ وَلَمْ تَجِدُواْ كَاتِباً فَرِهَٰنٌ مَّقْبُوضَةٌ فَإِنْ أَمِنَ بَعْضُكُم بَعْضاً فَلْيُؤَدِّ ٱلَّذِي ٱؤْتُمِنَ أَمَانَتَهُ وَلْيَتَّقِ ٱللَّهَ رَبَّهُ وَلاَ تَكْتُمُواْ ٱلشَّهَٰدَةَ وَمَن يَكْتُمْهَا فَإِنَّهُ آثِمٌ قَلْبُهُ وَٱللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ عَلِيمٌ,And if you are upon a journey travelling and you contract a debt and you do not find a writer then a pledge ruhun or rihān plural of rahn in hand as a guarantee for you. The Sunna clarifies the permissibility of making pledges in towns where writers may be forthcoming; but the stipulation is made in the event of travel because in this case it is more important to have a guarantee; God’s reference to it being ‘in hand’ maqbūda is a condition for the pledge given to be valid and to satisfy the pledgee or his representative. But if one of you the creditor trusts another the debtor over the debt and does not require a pledge let him who is trusted the debtor deliver his trust the debt; and let him fear God his Lord when delivering it. And do not conceal the testimony if you are summoned to give it; whoever conceals it his heart is sinful the heart is mentioned because it is the locus of the testimony and because if it sins there are other sinful consequences and so the person will be punished as though he were a sinner; and God knows what you do nothing of which can be hidden from Him.
للَّهِ ما فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوٰتِ وَمَا فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَإِن تُبْدُواْ مَا فِيۤ أَنْفُسِكُمْ أَوْ تُخْفُوهُ يُحَاسِبْكُمْ بِهِ ٱللَّهُ فَيَغْفِرُ لِمَن يَشَآءُ وَيُعَذِّبُ مَن يَشَآءُ وَٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,To God belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth. Whether you disclose manifest what is in your hearts or hide it of evil and resolve for it God shall take you to account for it informing you of it on the Day of Resurrection. Then He will forgive whom He will to forgive and chastise whom He will to chastise both verbs are apocopated fa-yaghfir ‘he will forgive’ wa-yu‘adhdhib ‘he will chastise’ if taken as the responses to the conditional in tubdū ‘if you proclaim’; but they may also be read with a final nominative inflection yaghfiru yu‘adhdhibu in which case it would constitute a new clause and follow on from an implicit fa-huwa ‘then He’. And God has power over all things including reckoning with you and requiting you.
ءَامَنَ ٱلرَّسُولُ بِمَآ أُنْزِلَ إِلَيْهِ مِن رَّبِّهِ وَٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ كُلٌّ آمَنَ بِٱللَّهِ وَمَلاۤئِكَتِهِ وَكُتُبِهِ وَرُسُلِهِ لاَ نُفَرِّقُ بَيْنَ أَحَدٍ مِّن رُّسُلِهِ وَقَالُواْ سَمِعْنَا وَأَطَعْنَا غُفْرَانَكَ رَبَّنَا وَإِلَيْكَ ٱلْمَصِيرُ,The Messenger Muhammad (s) believes in affirms the truth of what was revealed to him from his Lord namely the Qur’ān and the believers wa’l-mu’minūna is a supplement to al-rasūlu ‘the Messenger’; each one the tanwīn of kullun stands in place of the second noun in an annexation sc. kullu wāhidin believes in God and His angels and in His Books all of them and each of them and His messengers and they say ‘we make no distinction between any of His messengers’ believing in some and disbelieving in others in the manner of the Jews and the Christians. And they say ‘We hear what we have been enjoined to hear and accept and obey; we ask you Your forgiveness our Lord; to You is the homecoming’ that is the return at the Resurrection. When the previous verse was revealed the believers complained of evil whisperings and it grieved them that they should be taken to account according to the principle expressed in it and so the following was revealed
لاَ يُكَلِّفُ ٱللَّهُ نَفْساً إِلاَّ وُسْعَهَا لَهَا مَا كَسَبَتْ وَعَلَيْهَا مَا ٱكْتَسَبَتْ رَبَّنَا لاَ تُؤَاخِذْنَا إِن نَّسِينَآ أَوْ أَخْطَأْنَا رَبَّنَا وَلاَ تَحْمِلْ عَلَيْنَآ إِصْراً كَمَا حَمَلْتَهُ عَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِنَا رَبَّنَا وَلاَ تُحَمِّلْنَا مَا لاَ طَاقَةَ لَنَا بِهِ وَٱعْفُ عَنَّا وَٱغْفِرْ لَنَا وَٱرْحَمْنَآ أَنتَ مَوْلَٰـنَا فَٱنْصُرْنَا عَلَى ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلْكَافِرِينَ,God charges no soul save to its capacity that is what it is capable of bearing; for it is what it has merited of good and its reward and against it is what it has earned of evil and its burden no person shall be requited for another’s sin or for what he has not earned even if he was tempted to do it. Say Our Lord take us not to task by way of chastisement if we forget or err by straying from the right path unknowingly — as You used to take to task those before us God has lifted this burden from this community as reported in hadīth. The petition here then is a way of acknowledging God’s favour; our Lord burden us not with a load an affair which we cannot bear such as You did lay upon those before us namely upon the Children of Israel as for example the killing of oneself in repentance the paying of a quarter of one’s property for alms and the severing of the impure part. Our Lord do not burden us beyond what we have the power the strength to bear of obligations and trials; and pardon us effacing our sins and forgive us and have mercy on us with mercy added to Your forgiveness; You are our Patron our Master and the Guardian of our affairs; so grant us assistance against the disbelieving folk by establishing definitive proof for us and victory over them in battle for it is expected of a patron that he assist his clients against their enemies. In a hadīth it is stated that when this verse was revealed and the Prophet s was reciting it after each word it was said to him “Granted”.
الۤمۤ,Alif Lām Mīm God knows best what He means by these letters.
ٱللَّهُ لاۤ إِلَـٰهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ ٱلْحَيُّ ٱلْقَيُّومُ,God! There is no god except Him the Living the Eternal.
نَزَّلَ عَلَيْكَ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ بِٱلْحَقِّ مُصَدِّقاً لِّمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ وَأَنزَلَ ٱلتَّوْرَاةَ وَٱلإِنْجِيلَ,He has revealed to you O Muhammad (s) the Book the Qur’ān enveloped by the truth with veracity in what it announces confirming what was before it of Books; and He revealed the Torah and the Gospel
مِن قَبْلُ هُدًى لِّلنَّاسِ وَأَنزَلَ ٱلْفُرْقَانَ إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ بِآيَاتِ ٱللَّهِ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ شَدِيدٌ وَٱللَّهُ عَزِيزٌ ذُو ٱنْتِقَامٍ,before that is to say before revealing it the Qur’ān as guidance hudan a circumstantial qualifier meaning hādiyīn ‘guides from error’ to people to those who followed these two Books He uses the word anzala for the revelation of these two and nazzala for that of the Qur’ān for the latter entails repetition whereas the two Books were revealed in one instance; and He revealed the Criterion al-furqān meaning the Scriptures that discriminate between truth and falsehood. He mentions this Criterion after He has mentioned the three Scriptures so that it encompasses all revealed Scriptures besides these. As for those who disbelieve in God’s signs the Qur’ān or any other revelation for them awaits a terrible chastisement; God is Mighty victorious in His affair so that nothing can prevent Him from effecting His promise and His threat; Lord of Retribution with a severe punishment for those that disobeyed Him the like of which none can do.
إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لاَ يَخْفَىٰ عَلَيْهِ شَيْءٌ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَلاَ فِي ٱلسَّمَآءِ,Nothing no existent thing whatever is hidden in heaven and earth from God on account of His knowledge of universals and particulars. God specifies them heaven and earth because sensory perception does not go beyond these.
هُوَ ٱلَّذِي يُصَوِّرُكُمْ فِي ٱلأَرْحَامِ كَيْفَ يَشَآءُ لاَ إِلَـٰهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ,He it is Who forms you in the wombs as He will as males or females white black or otherwise. There is no god except Him the Mighty in His Kingdom the Wise in His actions.
هُوَ ٱلَّذِيۤ أَنزَلَ عَلَيْكَ ٱلْكِتَابَ مِنْهُ آيَاتٌ مُّحْكَمَاتٌ هُنَّ أُمُّ ٱلْكِتَابِ وَأُخَرُ مُتَشَابِهَاتٌ فَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ في قُلُوبِهِمْ زَيْغٌ فَيَتَّبِعُونَ مَا تَشَابَهَ مِنْهُ ٱبْتِغَاءَ ٱلْفِتْنَةِ وَٱبْتِغَاءَ تَأْوِيلِهِ وَمَا يَعْلَمُ تَأْوِيلَهُ إِلاَّ ٱللَّهُ وَٱلرَّاسِخُونَ فِي ٱلْعِلْمِ يَقُولُونَ آمَنَّا بِهِ كُلٌّ مِّنْ عِندِ رَبِّنَا وَمَا يَذَّكَّرُ إِلاَّ أُوْلُواْ ٱلأَلْبَابِ,He it is Who revealed to you the Book wherein are verses that are clear lucid in proof forming the Mother Book the original basis for rulings and others allegorical whose meanings are not known such as the opening verses of some sūras. He God refers to the whole Qur’ān as 1 ‘clear’ muhkam where He says A Book whose verses have been made clear Q. 111 meaning that it contains no imperfections; and as 2 ‘allegorical’ mutashābih where He says A Book consimilar Q. 3923 meaning that its parts resemble each other in terms of beauty and veracity. As for those in whose hearts is deviation inclination away from truth they follow the allegorical part desiring sedition among the ignorant of them throwing them into specious arguments and confusion and desiring its interpretation its explanation and none knows its interpretation its explanation save God Him alone. And those firmly rooted established and capable in knowledge al-rāsikhūna fī’l-‘ilm is the subject the predicate of which is what follows say ‘We believe in it the allegorical part that it is from God and we do not know its meaning; all of the clear and the allegorical is from our Lord’; yet none remembers yadhdhakkar the initial tā’ of yatadhakkar has been assimilated with the dhāl that is none is admonished but people of pith possessors of intellect who when they see those following that allegorical part only also say
رَبَّنَا لاَ تُزِغْ قُلُوبَنَا بَعْدَ إِذْ هَدَيْتَنَا وَهَبْ لَنَا مِن لَّدُنْكَ رَحْمَةً إِنَّكَ أَنْتَ ٱلْوَهَّابُ,Our Lord do not cause our hearts to deviate do not cause them to incline away from the truth in their desire to interpret it such as is inappropriate for us — as You caused the hearts of those others to deviate — after You have guided us after You have shown us the way to it; and give us mercy from You as a strengthening; You are the Bestower.
رَبَّنَآ إِنَّكَ جَامِعُ ٱلنَّاسِ لِيَوْمٍ لاَّ رَيْبَ فِيهِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لاَ يُخْلِفُ ٱلْمِيعَادَ,Our Lord You shall gather mankind for a day that is on a day of which there is no doubt no uncertainty that is the Day of Resurrection when You will requite them for their deeds as You had promised; verily God will not fail the tryst His promise of the Upraising there is a shift of address here from the second to the third person and these last words could constitute God’s speech. The purpose of their supplication in this way is to show that their concern is with the matter of the Hereafter and for this reason they ask God for adherence to the path of guidance in order to attain its reward. The two Shaykhs Bukhārī and Muslim reported that ‘Ā’isha may God be pleased with her said ‘The Messenger of God s recited this verse It is He Who revealed to you the Book wherein are verses clear to the end of the verse and said “When you see those pursuing the allegorical parts know that these are the ones God refers to in this verse so beware of them” ’. Al-Tabarānī reported in his al-Kabīr that Abū Mūsā al-Ash‘arī heard the Prophet s say ‘I fear nothing for my community except three faults’ and he mentioned that one of these would be when the Book is opened in front of them and the believer will desire to interpret it and yet none knows its interpretation save God; and those firmly rooted in knowledge say ‘We believe in it all is from our Lord; yet none remembers but people of pith’ Q. 37 end of the hadīth.
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لَن تُغْنِيَ عَنْهُمْ أَمْوَالُهُمْ وَلاَ أَوْلاَدُهُم مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ شَيْئاً وَأُولَـٰئِكَ هُمْ وَقُودُ ٱلنَّارِ,As for the disbelievers neither their riches nor their children will avail will protect them against God that is against His chastisement; those — they shall be fuel for the Fire they shall constitute what the Fire will be fuelled by read waqūd as opposed to wuqūd ‘fuel’.
كَدَأْبِ آلِ فِرْعَوْنَ وَٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ كَذَّبُواْ بِآيَاتِنَا فَأَخَذَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ بِذُنُوبِهِمْ وَٱللَّهُ شَدِيدُ ٱلْعِقَابِ,Their way is as the way as the habit of Pharaoh’s folk and the communities of people before them such as ‘Ād and Thamūd who denied Our signs; God seized them He destroyed them for their sins this statement explains the previous one; God is severe in retribution.
قُلْ لِّلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ سَتُغْلَبُونَ وَتُحْشَرُونَ إِلَىٰ جَهَنَّمَ وَبِئْسَ ٱلْمِهَادُ,When the Prophet s enjoined the Jews to enter into Islam after his return from Badr they said ‘Do not fool yourself just because you killed a few men of Quraysh inexperienced and knowing nothing about fighting’ whereupon the following was revealed Say O Muhammad (s) to the disbelievers from among the Jews ‘You shall be vanquished sa-tughlabūn or read sa-yughlabūn ‘they shall be vanquished’ in this world through being killed or taken captive and made to pay the jizya which actually took place and mustered read in both ways wa-tuhsharūna ‘you will be mustered’ or wa-yuhsharūna ‘they will be mustered’ in the Hereafter to Hell which you shall enter — an evil cradling!’ an evil resting place.
قَدْ كَانَ لَكُمْ آيَةٌ فِي فِئَتَيْنِ ٱلْتَقَتَا فِئَةٌ تُقَاتِلُ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ وَأُخْرَىٰ كَافِرَةٌ يَرَوْنَهُمْ مِّثْلَيْهِمْ رَأْيَ ٱلْعَيْنِ وَٱللَّهُ يُؤَيِّدُ بِنَصْرِهِ مَن يَشَآءُ إِنَّ فِي ذٰلِكَ لَعِبْرَةً لأُوْلِي ٱلأَبْصَارِ,There has already been a sign an example the verb qad kāna ‘there has been’ is used to separate the statement to follow from the previous one for you in two hosts two parties that met one another in battle on the day of Badr; one company fighting in the way of God in obedience to Him namely the Prophet and his Companions who numbered three hundred and thirteen men most of them on foot with two horses six plates of armour and eight swords; and another unbelieving; they the disbelievers numbering almost a thousand saw them the Muslims twice the like of them that is more numerous than themselves as the eye sees in manifest vision witnessing; and God granted them victory despite their fewer number; for God confirms He strengthens with His help whom He will granting him victory. Surely in that which is mentioned is a lesson for people of vision those who are discerning so will you not be warned by this and become believers?
زُيِّنَ لِلنَّاسِ حُبُّ ٱلشَّهَوَاتِ مِنَ ٱلنِّسَاءِ وَٱلْبَنِينَ وَٱلْقَنَاطِيرِ ٱلْمُقَنْطَرَةِ مِنَ ٱلذَّهَبِ وَٱلْفِضَّةِ وَٱلْخَيْلِ ٱلْمُسَوَّمَةِ وَٱلأَنْعَامِ وَٱلْحَرْثِ ذٰلِكَ مَتَاعُ ٱلْحَيَاةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَٱللَّهُ عِنْدَهُ حُسْنُ ٱلْمَآبِ,Beautified for mankind is love of lusts that which the self lusts after and calls for beautified by Satan or by God as a test — of women children stored-up heaps of gold and silver horses of mark fine horses cattle namely camels cows and sheep and tillage the cultivation of land. That which is mentioned is the comfort of the life of this world enjoyed while it lasts but then perishes; but God — with Him is the more excellent abode place of return which is Paradise and for this reason one should desire none other than this abode.
قُلْ أَؤُنَبِّئُكُمْ بِخَيْرٍ مِّن ذٰلِكُمْ لِلَّذِينَ ٱتَّقَوْا عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ جَنَّاتٌ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلأَنْهَارُ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا وَأَزْوَاجٌ مُّطَهَّرَةٌ وَرِضْوَانٌ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَٱللَّهُ بَصِيرٌ بِٱلْعِبَادِ,Say O Muhammad (s) to your people ‘Shall I tell you shall I inform you of something better than that? that which has been mentioned of lusts this interrogative is meant as an affirmative. For those that are fearful of idolatry with their Lord ‘inda rabbihim is the predicate the subject being the following jannātun…’ are Gardens underneath which rivers flow abiding therein decreed for them therein is eternal life when they enter it and spouses purified of menstruation and other impurities and beatitude read ridwān or rudwān meaning ‘much pleasure’ from God; and God is Seer knower of His servants requiting each of them according to his deeds.
ٱلَّذِينَ يَقُولُونَ رَبَّنَآ إِنَّنَآ آمَنَّا فَٱغْفِرْ لَنَا ذُنُوبَنَا وَقِنَا عَذَابَ ٱلنَّارِ,Those alladhīna is either an adjectival qualification of or a substitution for the previous alladhīna who say “O Our Lord we believe in You and in Your Prophet; so forgive us our sins and guard us from the chastisement of the Fire”.
ٱلصَّابِرِينَ وَٱلصَّادِقِينَ وَٱلْقَانِتِينَ وَٱلْمُنْفِقِينَ وَٱلْمُسْتَغْفِرِينَ بِٱلأَسْحَارِ,The patient in obedience and against disobedience al-sābirīna ‘the patient’ is an adjectival qualification of alladhīna ‘those’ truthful in their faith obedient compliant before God expenders of charity imploring God’s pardon by saying ‘Lord forgive us’ at daybreak’ in the last part of the night singled out here for mention because it is the time of unawareness and of the joy of sleep.
شَهِدَ ٱللَّهُ أَنَّهُ لاَ إِلَـٰهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ وَٱلْمَلاَئِكَةُ وَأُوْلُواْ ٱلْعِلْمِ قَآئِمَاً بِٱلْقِسْطِ لاَ إِلَـٰهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ,God bears witness that is to say He has made it clear to His creation through proofs and signs that there is no god none that is truly worshipped in existence except Him He has borne witness to this and the angels have also borne witness to this by affirming it and those of knowledge from among the prophets and the believers through their conviction and in words; upholding constantly and uniquely maintaining His creations with justice qā’iman ‘upholding’ is in the accusative because it is a circumstantial qualifier and is governed by the import of the statement implied to be something like tafarrada ‘He alone is upholding…’; there is no god except Him He has repeated it for emphasis; the Mighty in His Kingdom the Wise in His actions.
إِنَّ ٱلدِّينَ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ ٱلإِسْلاَمُ وَمَا ٱخْتَلَفَ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ ٱلْكِتَابَ إِلاَّ مِن بَعْدِ مَا جَآءَهُمُ ٱلْعِلْمُ بَغْياً بَيْنَهُمْ وَمَن يَكْفُرْ بِآيَاتِ ٱللَّهِ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ سَرِيعُ ٱلْحِسَابِ,Lo! the religion with God pleasing to Him is submission to the One God al-islām that is to say the Divine Law with which the messengers were sent founded upon the affirmation of God’s Oneness a variant reading for inna ‘lo!’ has anna ‘that’ as an inclusive substitution for annahu to the end of that verse sc. shahida Llāhu … anna l-dīna ‘inda Llāhi l-islām ‘God bears witness that religion with God is Islām. Those who were given the Scripture the Jews and the Christians differed in religion some affirming God’s Oneness others rejecting it only after the knowledge of Oneness came to them through transgression on the part of the disbelievers among themselves. And whoever disbelieves in God’s signs God is swift at reckoning that is at requiting him.
فَإنْ حَآجُّوكَ فَقُلْ أَسْلَمْتُ وَجْهِيَ للَّهِ وَمَنِ ٱتَّبَعَنِ وَقُلْ لِّلَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ وَٱلأُمِّيِّينَ أَأَسْلَمْتُمْ فَإِنْ أَسْلَمُواْ فَقَدِ ٱهْتَدَواْ وَّإِن تَوَلَّوْاْ فَإِنَّمَا عَلَيْكَ ٱلْبَلَٰغُ وَٱللَّهُ بَصِيرٌ بِٱلْعِبَادِ,So if they the disbelievers dispute with you O Muhammad (s) concerning religion say to them ‘I have surrendered my countenance to God that is to say I have submitted to Him I and whoever follows me’ wajh ‘countenance’ is chosen here because of its noble character for the other parts of the body will just as soon surrender once the countenance has; and say to those who have been given the Scripture the Jews and the Christians and to the uninstructed the Arab idolaters ‘Have you submitted?’ that is to say ‘Submit!’ And so if they have submitted they have been guided from error but if they turn their backs to Islam your duty is only to deliver the Message; and God sees His servants and so requites them for their deeds — this statement was revealed before the command to fight them had been revealed.
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يَكْفُرُونَ بِآيَاتِ ٱللَّهِ وَيَقْتُلُونَ ٱلنَّبِيِّينَ بِغَيْرِ حَقٍّ وَيَقْتُلُونَ ٱلَّذِينَ يَأْمُرُونَ بِٱلْقِسْطِ مِنَ ٱلنَّاسِ فَبَشِّرْهُم بِعَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ,Those who disbelieve in the signs of God and slay yaqtulūna is also read as yuqātilūna ‘they fight against’ the prophets without right and slay those who enjoin to equity to justice and these are the Jews who are reported to have killed forty–three prophets and to have been forbidden this by a hundred and seventy devout worshippers among them each of whom was killed immediately. So give them good tidings let them know of a painful chastisement. The use of ‘good tidings’ here is meant as a sarcastic ridicule of them the fā’ of fa-bashshirhum so give them good tidings is considered part of the predicate of inna because its noun that is its relative clause resembles a conditional sc. in yakfurūna ‘if they disbelieve…’ fa-bashshirhum ‘then give them good tidings…’.
أُولَـٰئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ حَبِطَتْ أَعْمَالُهُمْ فِي ٱلدُّنْيَا وَٱلآخِرَةِ وَمَا لَهُمْ مِّن نَّاصِرِينَ,Those are the ones whose works what good they did in the way of charity and kindness to kin have failed whose works are invalid in this world and the Hereafter and so they have nothing to reckon with since these works are of no consequence; they have no helpers no protectors from the chastisement.
أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ نَصِيباً مِّنَ ٱلْكِتَابِ يُدْعَوْنَ إِلَىٰ كِتَابِ ٱللَّهِ لِيَحْكُمَ بَيْنَهُمْ ثُمَّ يَتَوَلَّىٰ فَرِيقٌ مِّنْهُمْ وَهُمْ مُّعْرِضُونَ,Have you not seen those who were given a portion a share of the Book the Torah being called to the Book of God yud‘awna ‘being called’ is a circumstantial qualifier that it might decide between them and then a party of them turned away opposed? to the acceptance of its rulings. This was revealed concerning the Jews two of them fornicated and they the Jews asked the Prophet s to adjudicate the case. He ruled that they be stoned but they the Jews refused to do so. When the Torah was brought and consulted the same verdict was found and so the two were stoned but they the Jews became wrathful.
ذٰلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ قَالُواْ لَن تَمَسَّنَا ٱلنَّارُ إِلاَّ أَيَّاماً مَّعْدُودَاتٍ وَغَرَّهُمْ فِي دِينِهِمْ مَّا كَانُواْ يَفْتَرُونَ,That turning away and rejection was because they said ‘the Fire shall not touch us except for a number of days’ that is for forty days only the length of time their forefathers worshipped the calf after which it would end; and the lies they used to invent in their saying this have deluded them in their religion wa-gharrahum fī dīnihim ‘it has deluded them in their religion’ is semantically connected to mā kānū yaftarūna ‘the lies which they used to invent’.
فَكَيْفَ إِذَا جَمَعْنَاهُمْ لِيَوْمٍ لاَّ رَيْبَ فِيهِ وَوُفِّيَتْ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ مَّا كَسَبَتْ وَهُمْ لاَ يُظْلَمُونَ,But how will it be their predicament when We gather them for a day that is to say on a day of which there is no doubt no uncertainty that is the Day of Resurrection; and every soul from among the People of the Scripture and others shall be paid in full the requital of what is has earned what it has done of good or evil and they that is people shall not be wronged? in that no good deed shall be diminished and no evil deed shall be increased.
قُلِ ٱللَّهُمَّ مَالِكَ ٱلْمُلْكِ تُؤْتِي ٱلْمُلْكَ مَن تَشَآءُ وَتَنزِعُ ٱلْمُلْكَ مِمَّنْ تَشَآءُ وَتُعِزُّ مَن تَشَآءُ وَتُذِلُّ مَن تَشَآءُ بِيَدِكَ ٱلْخَيْرُ إِنَّكَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,When the Prophet s promised his community sovereignty over the lands of Persia and Byzantium the hypocrites said ‘How preposterous!’ and so the following was revealed Say ‘O God Master of the Kingdom you give the Kingdom to whom You will from among your creatures and seize the Kingdom from whom You will; You exalt whom You will by giving it the kingdom to him and You abase whom You will by seizing it from him; in Your hand in Your power is good that is as well as evil. You are Able to do all things.
تُولِجُ ٱللَّيْلَ فِي ٱلْنَّهَارِ وَتُولِجُ ٱلنَّهَارَ فِي ٱلْلَّيْلِ وَتُخْرِجُ ٱلْحَيَّ مِنَ ٱلْمَيِّتِ وَتُخْرِجُ ٱلَمَيِّتَ مِنَ ٱلْحَيِّ وَتَرْزُقُ مَن تَشَآءُ بِغَيْرِ حِسَابٍ,You make the night to pass to enter into the day and You make the day to pass to enter into the night each of them increasing by the amount by which the other decreases; You bring forth the living from the dead such as humans and birds from sperm-drops and eggs respectively; and You bring forth the dead the sperm-drop and the egg from the living and You provide with abundant provision whom You will without reckoning’.
لاَّ يَتَّخِذِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ ٱلْكَافِرِينَ أَوْلِيَآءَ مِن دُونِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَمَن يَفْعَلْ ذٰلِكَ فَلَيْسَ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ فِي شَيْءٍ إِلاَّ أَن تَتَّقُواْ مِنْهُمْ تُقَـٰةً وَيُحَذِّرُكُمُ ٱللَّهُ نَفْسَهُ وَإِلَىٰ ٱللَّهِ ٱلْمَصِيرُ,Let not the believers take the disbelievers as patrons rather than that is instead of the believers — for whoever does that that is whoever takes them as patrons does not belong to the religion of God in anyway — unless you protect yourselves against them as a safeguard tuqātan ‘as a safeguard’ is the verbal noun from taqiyyatan that is to say unless you fear something in which case you may show patronage to them through words but not in your hearts this was before the hegemony of Islam and the dispensation applies to any individual residing in a land with no say in it. God warns you He instills fear in you of His Self warning that He may be wrathful with you if you take them as patrons; and to God is the journey’s end the return and He will requite you.
قُلْ إِن تُخْفُواْ مَا فِي صُدُورِكُمْ أَوْ تُبْدُوهُ يَعْلَمْهُ ٱللَّهُ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,Say to them ‘Whether you hide what is in your breasts in your hearts of patronage to them or disclose it manifest it God knows it and He knows what is in the heavens and what is in the earth; and God is Able to do all things and this includes punishing those who patronise them.
يَوْمَ تَجِدُ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ مَّا عَمِلَتْ مِنْ خَيْرٍ مُّحْضَراً وَمَا عَمِلَتْ مِن سُوۤءٍ تَوَدُّ لَوْ أَنَّ بَيْنَهَا وَبَيْنَهُ أَمَدَاً بَعِيداً وَيُحَذِّرُكُمُ ٱللَّهُ نَفْسَهُ وَٱللَّهُ رَؤُوفٌ بِٱلْعِبَادِ,And remember the day every soul shall find what it has done of good present before it and what it has done of evil the last statement constitutes the subject the predicate of which is what follows it will wish that between it and that there were a great distance an extremely lengthy distance so that it the evil could never reach it. God warns you of His Self this is repeated for emphasis and God is Kind to His servants.
قُلْ إِن كُنتُمْ تُحِبُّونَ ٱللَّهَ فَٱتَّبِعُونِي يُحْبِبْكُمُ ٱللَّهُ وَيَغْفِرْ لَكُمْ ذُنُوبَكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,When they said ‘We only worship idols out of our love for God that they might bring us close to Him’ the following was revealed Say O Muhammad (s) ‘If you love God follow me and God will love you meaning that He will reward you and forgive you your sins; God is Forgiving as regards the sins committed previously by one who now follows me; Merciful to him.
قُلْ أَطِيعُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَٱلرَّسُولَ فإِن تَوَلَّوْاْ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لاَ يُحِبُّ ٱلْكَافِرِينَ,Say to them ‘Obey God and the Messenger’ as regards the belief in the Oneness of God which he enjoins upon you. But if they turn their backs if they object to obedience God loves not the disbelievers meaning that He will chastise them the third person pronominalisation ‘they’ is replaced by the overt noun ‘the disbelievers’.
إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ ٱصْطَفَىٰ ءَادَمَ وَنُوحاً وَآلَ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَآلَ عِمْرَانَ عَلَى ٱلْعَالَمِينَ,Lo! God preferred He has chosen Adam and Noah and the House of Abraham and the House of ‘Imrān meaning He preferred their selves sc. Abraham and ‘Imrān above the worlds by making prophethood reside in them and their progeny
ذُرِّيَّةً بَعْضُهَا مِن بَعْضٍ وَٱللَّهُ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ,the seed of one offspring from another of them; God is Hearer Knower.
إِذْ قَالَتِ ٱمْرَأَتُ عِمْرَانَ رَبِّ إِنِّي نَذَرْتُ لَكَ مَا فِي بَطْنِي مُحَرَّراً فَتَقَبَّلْ مِنِّي إِنَّكَ أَنتَ ٱلسَّمِيعُ ٱلْعَلِيمُ,Mention when the wife of ‘Imrān Hanna said after she had reached old age and longed for a child and supplicated to God and sensed that she was carrying child ‘O Lord I have vowed to offer You what is within my womb as a consecration one liberated and delivered from the distractions of this world for the service of Your Holy House in Jerusalem. Accept this from me. Lo! It is You Who are the Hearer of petition the Knower of intentions. ‘Imrān died while she was still pregnant.
فَلَمَّا وَضَعَتْهَا قَالَتْ رَبِّ إِنِّي وَضَعْتُهَآ أُنْثَىٰ وَٱللَّهُ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا وَضَعَتْ وَلَيْسَ ٱلذَّكَرُ كَٱلأُنْثَىٰ وَإِنِّي سَمَّيْتُهَا مَرْيَمَ وِإِنِّي أُعِيذُهَا بِكَ وَذُرِّيَّتَهَا مِنَ ٱلشَّيْطَانِ ٱلرَّجِيمِ,And when she gave birth to her a girl and she had been hoping for a boy since only males were consecrated to the service of God she said apologetically ‘O Lord I have given birth to a female’ — and God knew very well what she had given birth to a parenthetical statement constituting God’s speech a variant reading for wada‘at ‘she gave birth’ has wada‘tu ‘I gave birth’ making these Hanna’s words sc. ‘and God knows very well what I have given birth to’; the male that she had asked for is not as the female that was bestowed upon her because he is designed for the service of God while she would not be suitable on account of her lesser physical ability her private parts the effects of menstruation on her and so on. ‘And I have named her Mary and commend her to You with her seed her children to protect them from the accursed the outcast Satan’. In a hadīth it is stated ‘Every new-born is touched by Satan and begins life by crying except for Mary and her son’ as reported by the two Shaykhs Bukhārī and Muslim.
فَتَقَبَّلَهَا رَبُّهَا بِقَبُولٍ حَسَنٍ وَأَنبَتَهَا نَبَاتاً حَسَناً وَكَفَّلَهَا زَكَرِيَّا كُلَّمَا دَخَلَ عَلَيْهَا زَكَرِيَّا ٱلْمِحْرَابَ وَجَدَ عِندَهَا رِزْقاً قَالَ يٰمَرْيَمُ أَنَّىٰ لَكِ هَـٰذَا قَالَتْ هُوَ مِنْ عِندِ ٱللَّهِ إِنَّ ٱللًّهَ يَرْزُقُ مَن يَشَآءُ بِغَيْرِ حِسَابٍ,Her Lord accepted the child that is He received Mary from her mother with gracious acceptance and made her grow excellently He made her grow up with excellent character. She would grow in a day by as much as a new-born grew during a year. Her mother took her to the priests the keepers of the Holy House of Jerusalem and said ‘This here before you is the dedication I offered’. They competed for guardianship of her because she was the daughter of their religious leader at which point Zachariah said ‘I am most worthy of her for her maternal aunt lives with me’. The others said ‘No not until we have cast lots’. Thus all twenty nine of them departed to the River Jordan where they cast their quills agreeing that the one whose quill remained fast and floated to the surface of the water would be most worthy of being guardian over her. Zachariah’s quill remained fast and surfaced. He took charge of her and built for her a gallery-room with a ladder in the temple and none apart from him went up to her. He used to bring her food drink and oil and would find her with summer fruits in winter and winter fruits in summer just as God says and Zachariah took charge of her he took her to him a variant reading of kafalahā ‘he took charge of her’ is kaffalahā ‘He God gave Zachariah charge of her’ with Zakariyyā’ or Zakariyyā in the accusative and ‘God’ as the subject of the verb. Whenever Zachariah went into the sanctuary that is the room the most noble seat in the temple where she was he found her with provisions. ‘O Mary’ he said ‘Whence comes this to you?’ She still very young said ‘From God He sends it to me from Paradise’ ‘Truly God provides abundant provision for whomever He will without reckoning’ without consequence.
هُنَالِكَ دَعَا زَكَرِيَّا رَبَّهُ قَالَ رَبِّ هَبْ لِي مِن لَّدُنْكَ ذُرِّيَّةً طَيِّبَةً إِنَّكَ سَمِيعُ ٱلدُّعَآءِ,Then when Zachariah had seen this and realised that the One with power to bring something about in other than its natural time is able to bring about a child in old age and with those of his family line all deceased Zachariah prayed to his Lord when he entered the sanctuary to pray in the middle of the night saying ‘Lord bestow upon me from You a goodly offspring a righteous son verily You are the Hearer of You are the One Who answers supplication’.
فَنَادَتْهُ ٱلْمَلاۤئِكَةُ وَهُوَ قَائِمٌ يُصَلِّي فِي ٱلْمِحْرَابِ أَنَّ اللَّهَ يُبَشِّرُكَ بِيَحْيَـىٰ مُصَدِّقاً بِكَلِمَةٍ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَسَيِّداً وَحَصُوراً وَنَبِيّاً مِّنَ ٱلصَّالِحِينَ,And the angels namely Gabriel called to him standing in the sanctuary in the temple at worship that anna means bi-anna; a variant reading has inna implying a direct speech statement ‘God gives you good tidings read yubashshiruka or yubshiruka of John who shall confirm a Word being from God namely Jesus that he is God’s Spirit; he is referred to as God’s ‘Word’ because he was created through the word kun ‘Be’; a lord with a following and one chaste forbidden from women and a prophet of the righteous’ it is said that he never sinned and never so intended.
قَالَ رَبِّ أَنَّىٰ يَكُونُ لِي غُلاَمٌ وَقَدْ بَلَغَنِي ٱلْكِبَرُ وَٱمْرَأَتِي عَاقِرٌ قَالَ كَذَلِكَ ٱللَّهُ يَفْعَلُ مَا يَشَآءُ,He said ‘My Lord! How shall I have a boy a son when old age has overtaken me that is after I have reached extreme old age 120 years old; and my wife is barren?’ having reached the age of 98. He said ‘So it the matter will be’ with God creating a boy from both of you. ‘God does what He will’ nothing can prevent Him therefrom and in order to manifest this great power he was inspired with the question so that he would be answered through it this great power. And when his soul longed for the swift fulfilment of that of which good tidings had been given
قَالَ رَبِّ ٱجْعَلْ لِّيۤ آيَةً قَالَ آيَتُكَ أَلاَّ تُكَلِّمَ ٱلنَّاسَ ثَلاَثَةَ أَيَّامٍ إِلاَّ رَمْزاً وَٱذْكُر رَّبَّكَ كَثِيراً وَسَبِّحْ بِٱلْعَشِيِّ وَٱلإِبْكَارِ,He said ‘My Lord! Appoint for me a sign’ that is an indication of my wife’s pregnancy. He said ‘Your sign for this is that you shall not speak to men that is you shall refrain from speaking to them but not from remembrance of God save by tokens gestures for three days and nights. And remember your Lord often and glorify perform prayer at evening and dawn’ at the end of the day and at its beginning.
وَإِذْ قَالَتِ ٱلْمَلاَئِكَةُ يٰمَرْيَمُ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ ٱصْطَفَـٰكِ وَطَهَّرَكِ وَٱصْطَفَـٰكِ عَلَىٰ نِسَآءِ ٱلْعَـٰلَمِينَ,And mention when the angels namely Gabriel said ‘O Mary God has preferred you He has elected you and made you pure of the touch of men; He has preferred you above all women of the worlds that is the inhabitants of your time.
يٰمَرْيَمُ ٱقْنُتِي لِرَبِّكِ وَٱسْجُدِي وَٱرْكَعِي مَعَ ٱلرَّاكِعِينَ,O Mary be obedient to your Lord be compliant before Him prostrating and bowing with those who bow’ that is pray with those who pray.
ذٰلِكَ مِنْ أَنَبَآءِ ٱلْغَيْبِ نُوحِيهِ إِلَيكَ وَمَا كُنتَ لَدَيْهِمْ إِذْ يُلْقُون أَقْلاَمَهُمْ أَيُّهُمْ يَكْفُلُ مَرْيَمَ وَمَا كُنْتَ لَدَيْهِمْ إِذْ يَخْتَصِمُونَ,That which has been mentioned of the matter of Zachariah and Mary is of the tidings of the Unseen of the news of what was unknown to you. We reveal it to you O Muhammad (s) for you were not with them when they were casting quills in the water drawing their lots so that it be manifested to them which of them should have charge of which of them should bring up Mary; nor were you with them when they were disputing about the custodianship of Mary such that you might have known it and related it; but truly you know it only through revelation.
إِذْ قَالَتِ ٱلْمَلاۤئِكَةُ يٰمَرْيَمُ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُبَشِّرُكِ بِكَلِمَةٍ مِّنْهُ ٱسْمُهُ ٱلْمَسِيحُ عِيسَى ٱبْنُ مَرْيَمَ وَجِيهاً فِي ٱلدُّنْيَا وَٱلآخِرَةِ وَمِنَ ٱلْمُقَرَّبِينَ,Mention when the angels namely Gabriel said ‘O Mary God gives you good tidings of a Word from Him that is a boy whose name is the Messiah Jesus son of Mary He addresses her attributing him to her in order to point out that she will give birth to him without a father for the custom is to attribute the child to its father honoured shall he be in this world through prophethood and the Hereafter through his intercession and the high stations al-darajāt al-‘ulā cf. Q. 2075 and of those brought close to God.
وَيُكَلِّمُ ٱلنَّاسَ فِي ٱلْمَهْدِ وَكَهْلاً وَمِنَ ٱلصَّالِحِينَ,He shall speak to mankind in the cradle that is to say as a child before the age of speech and in his manhood and he is of the righteous’.
قَالَتْ رَبِّ أَنَّىٰ يَكُونُ لِي وَلَدٌ وَلَمْ يَمْسَسْنِي بَشَرٌ قَالَ كَذَلِكَ ٱللَّهُ يَخْلُقُ مَا يَشَآءُ إِذَا قَضَىٰ أَمْراً فَإِنَّمَا يَقُولُ لَهُ كُنْ فَيَكُونُ,She said ‘Lord how shall I have a child when no mortal has touched me?’ neither through conjugality or otherwise; He said the command ‘It is such that God will create from you a child without a father. God creates what He will. When He decrees a thing willing its creation He says to it only “Be” and it is that is and ‘he is’.
وَيُعَلِّمُهُ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ وَٱلْحِكْمَةَ وَٱلتَّوْرَاةَ وَٱلإِنْجِيلَ,And We will teach him read nu‘allimuhu or yu‘allimuhu ‘He will teach him’ the Book that is script wisdom and the Torah and the Gospel.
وَرَسُولاً إِلَىٰ بَنِيۤ إِسْرَائِيلَ أَنِّي قَدْ جِئْتُكُمْ بِآيَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ أَنِيۤ أَخْلُقُ لَكُمْ مِّنَ ٱلطِّينِ كَهَيْئَةِ ٱلطَّيْرِ فَأَنفُخُ فِيهِ فَيَكُونُ طَيْراً بِإِذْنِ ٱللَّهِ وَأُبْرِىءُ ٱلأَكْمَهَ وٱلأَبْرَصَ وَأُحْيِ ٱلْمَوْتَىٰ بِإِذْنِ ٱللَّهِ وَأُنَبِّئُكُمْ بِمَا تَأْكُلُونَ وَمَا تَدَّخِرُونَ فِي بُيُوتِكُمْ إِنَّ فِي ذٰلِكَ لآيَةً لَّكُمْ إِن كُنتُم مُّؤْمِنِينَ,And He will make him to be a messenger to the Children of Israel during his tender years or after puberty. Gabriel breathed into the opening of her garment and she became pregnant. What happened to her after this is mentioned later in sūrat Maryam Q. 1921ff. Thus when God sent him to the Children of Israel he said to them ‘I am God’s Messenger to you’ and ‘I have come to you with a sign an indication of my truthfulness from your Lord and it is that I will create a variant reading for the particle introducing the relative clause annī ‘that I’ has innī ‘truly I’ indicating a new independent sentence that I will fashion for you out of clay like the shape of a bird ka-hay’at ‘something like the shape of’ the kāf is the subject of a passive participle then I will breathe into it fīhi the suffixed pronoun -hi refers to the preceding kāf and it will be a bird tayran is also read tā’iran by the leave the will of God. So he created for them a bat being the most perfectly-created of birds and they would watch it flying but when it went out of sight it would fall dead — so that the work of a creature sc. Jesus may be distinguished from the work of the Creator namely God exalted be He and that he might know that perfection belongs to God alone. I will also heal the blind akmah is one that is blind from birth and the leper; these two are singled out for mention because with both afflictions the person is completely helpless. He Jesus was sent in an age of characterised by medicinal science and he cured through supplication fifty thousand in one day on the condition that each person would become a believer; and I bring to life the dead by the leave of God — He repeats this to preclude any false attributions of divinity to him — he brought back to life his friend ‘Āzar the son of an old woman and the daughter of the tithe-collector all of whom lived on and produced offspring and he also brought back to life Shem son of Noah but he died again immediately. I will inform you too of what things you eat and what you treasure up store in your houses and what I have never seen and he would inform people what they had eaten and what they would eat. Surely in that mentioned is a sign for you if you are believers.
وَمُصَدِّقاً لِّمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيَّ مِنَ ٱلتَّوْرَاةِ وَلأُحِلَّ لَكُم بَعْضَ ٱلَّذِي حُرِّمَ عَلَيْكُمْ وَجِئْتُكُمْ بِآيَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ فَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَأَطِيعُونِ,Likewise I have come to you confirming that which was before me of the Torah and to make lawful for you some of that which was forbidden to you in it. Thus he made lawful for them fish and birds which had no spikes; it is also said that he made it all lawful for them so that ba‘d ‘some’ means kull ‘all’. I have come to you with a sign from your Lord He has repeated it for emphasis and to expand upon it so fear God and obey me in what I command you of affirming God’s Oneness and being obedient to Him.
إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ رَبِّي وَرَبُّكُمْ فَٱعْبُدُوهُ هَـٰذَا صِرَاطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ,Surely God is my Lord and your Lord so worship Him. This that which I enjoin upon you is a straight path’. But they rejected him and did not believe in him.
فَلَمَّآ أَحَسَّ عِيسَىٰ مِنْهُمُ ٱلْكُفْرَ قَالَ مَنْ أَنصَارِيۤ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ قَالَ ٱلْحَوَارِيُّونَ نَحْنُ أَنْصَارُ ٱللَّهِ آمَنَّا بِٱللَّهِ وَٱشْهَدْ بِأَنَّا مُسْلِمُونَ,And when Jesus sensed when he became aware of their disbelief and they plotted to kill him he said ‘Who will be my helpers departing unto God?’ to help His religion; The disciples said ‘We will be helpers of God those who assist His religion they were Jesus’s intimates and the first to believe in him. They were twelve men who were of pure white complexion hawar; but some say that they were called hawāriyyūn because they were bleachers of clothes qassārūn; we believe in we accept the truth of God; witness O Jesus that we have submitted.
رَبَّنَآ آمَنَّا بِمَآ أَنزَلَتَ وَٱتَّبَعْنَا ٱلرَّسُولَ فَٱكْتُبْنَا مَعَ ٱلشَّٰهِدِينَ,Lord we believe in what You have revealed of the Gospel and we follow the Messenger Jesus; inscribe us therefore with those who bear witness’ to Your Oneness and to the truthfulness of Your Messenger.
وَمَكَرُواْ وَمَكَرَ ٱللَّهُ وَٱللَّهُ خَيْرُ ٱلْمَاكِرِينَ,God says And they the disbelievers among the Children of Israel schemed against Jesus by assigning someone to assassinate him; and God schemed by casting the likeness of Jesus onto the person who intended to kill him and so they killed him while Jesus was raised up into heaven; and God is the best of schemers most knowledgeable of him Jesus.
إِذْ قَالَ ٱللَّهُ يٰعِيسَىٰ إِنِّي مُتَوَفِّيكَ وَرَافِعُكَ إِلَيَّ وَمُطَهِّرُكَ مِنَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَجَاعِلُ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱتَّبَعُوكَ فَوْقَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ إِلَىٰ يَوْمِ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ ثُمَّ إِلَيَّ مَرْجِعُكُمْ فَأَحْكُمُ بَيْنَكُمْ فِيمَا كُنتُمْ فِيهِ تَخْتَلِفُونَ,And mention when God said ‘O Jesus I am gathering you seizing you and raising you to Me away from the world without death and I am cleansing you of removing you far away from those who disbelieved and I am setting those who follow you those Christians and Muslims who believed in your prophethood above those who disbelieved in you namely the Jews becoming above them through definitive argument and the sword until the Day of Resurrection. Then to Me shall be your return and I will decide between you as to what you were at variance about as regards religion.
فَأَمَّا ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ فَأُعَذِّبُهُمْ عَذَاباً شَدِيداً فِي ٱلدُّنْيَا وَٱلآخِرَةِ وَمَا لَهُمْ مِّن نَّاصِرِينَ,As for the disbelievers I will chastise them with a terrible chastisement in this world through being killed taken captive and made to pay the jizya and the Hereafter in the Fire; they shall have no helpers none to protect them from it.
وَأَمَّا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ فَيُوَفِّيهِمْ أُجُورَهُمْ وَٱللَّهُ لاَ يُحِبُّ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ,But as for the believers who do righteous deeds He will pay them in full yuwaffīhim is also read nuwaffīhim ‘We will pay them in full’ their wages. God loves not the evildoers that is He will chastise them. It is reported that God exalted be He sent him Jesus a cloud which raised him up but his mother clutched to him in tears. He then said to her ‘Verily the Resurrection shall bring us together again’. This took place on the Night of Ordainment laylat al-qadr in the Holy House of Jerusalem when he was thirty three years old. His mother lived on after him for six years. The two Shaykhs Bukhārī and Muslim narrate a hadīth in which it is stated that he Jesus will descend when the Hour is nigh and will rule according to the Law of our Prophet Muhammad and that he will slay the false messiah and the swine break the cross and impose the jizya. In a hadīth recorded by Muslim he will remain for seven years; according to Abū Dāwūd al-Tayālisī he will remain for forty years and he will die and have prayers performed over him. It is possible that what is meant by the forty years is the total time he will have spent on earth before he was raised and afterwards.
ذٰلِكَ نَتْلُوهُ عَلَيْكَ مِنَ الآيَاتِ وَٱلذِّكْرِ ٱلْحَكِيمِ,This what is mentioned of the matter of Jesus We recite to you narrate to you O Muhammad (s) of verses and wise clear remembrance namely the Qur’ān min al-āyāt ‘of verses’ is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the suffixed pronoun hā’ of natlūhu and its operator is the demonstrative import of dhālika ‘this’.
إِنَّ مَثَلَ عِيسَىٰ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ كَمَثَلِ ءَادَمَ خَلَقَهُ مِن تُرَابٍ ثُمَّ قَالَ لَهُ كُن فَيَكُونُ,Truly the likeness of Jesus his remarkable case in God’s sight is as Adam’s likeness as the case of Adam whom God created without father or mother this is a comparison of one remarkable thing with another more remarkable so that it convinces the disputer and establishes itself in one’s mind more effectively. He created him Adam that is his form of dust then said He to him ‘Be’ a human being and he was; similarly He said to Jesus ‘Be’ — without a father — and he was.
ٱلْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّكَ فَلاَ تَكُنْ مِّن ٱلْمُمْتَرِينَ,The truth is from your Lord al-haqqu min rabbik the predicate of a missing subject which is implied to be amr ‘Īsā ‘the matter concerning Jesus’; be not of those who waver those who are uncertain about it.
فَمَنْ حَآجَّكَ فِيهِ مِن بَعْدِ مَا جَآءَكَ مِنَ ٱلْعِلْمِ فَقُلْ تَعَالَوْاْ نَدْعُ أَبْنَآءَنَا وَأَبْنَآءَكُمْ وَنِسَآءَنَا وَنِسَآءَكُمْ وَأَنْفُسَنَا وأَنْفُسَكُمْ ثُمَّ نَبْتَهِلْ فَنَجْعَل لَّعْنَتَ ٱللَّهِ عَلَى ٱلْكَاذِبِينَ,And whoever from among the Christians disputes with you concerning him after the knowledge of his affair that has come to you say to them ‘Come! Let us call our sons and your sons our wives and your wives our selves and your selves and gather them together then let us humbly pray and invoke God’s curse upon those who lie’ by saying ‘Lord curse the one that tells lies concerning the affair of Jesus’. The Prophet s had called upon the Najrān delegation to do this when they disputed with him about Jesus. They said ‘Let us think about it and we will come back to you’. The judicious one among them said ‘You know that he is a prophet and that every people that has ever challenged a prophet to a mutual imprecation has been destroyed’. They left him and departed. When they went to see the Prophet s who had set out with al-Hasan al-Husayn Fātima and ‘Alī he said to them the Najrān delegation ‘When I supplicate you say ‘Amen’; but they refrained from this mutual imprecation and made peace with the Prophet on the condition that they pay the jizya as reported by Abū Nu‘aym. According to Ibn ‘Abbās the Prophet said ‘Had they set out and performed the mutual cursing they would have gone home and found neither possessions nor family’. It is also reported that had they set out with this intention they would have been consumed by fire.
إِنَّ هَـٰذَا لَهُوَ ٱلْقَصَصُ ٱلْحَقُّ وَمَا مِنْ إِلَـٰهٍ إِلاَّ ٱللَّهُ وَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَهُوَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ,This mentioned above is the true story the report free of any doubt. There is no god but God and assuredly God is Mighty in His Kingdom Wise in His actions.
فَإِن تَوَلَّوْاْ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلِيمٌ بِٱلْمُفْسِدِينَ,And if they turn their backs rejecting faith assuredly God knows the agents of corruption and will requite them here the third person pronominalisation has been replaced with the overt noun al-mufsidūn ‘the agents of corruption’.
قُلْ يٰأَهْلَ ٱلْكِتَابِ تَعَالَوْاْ إِلَىٰ كَلِمَةٍ سَوَآءٍ بَيْنَنَا وَبَيْنَكُمْ أَلاَّ نَعْبُدَ إِلاَّ ٱللَّهَ وَلاَ نُشْرِكَ بِهِ شَيْئاً وَلاَ يَتَّخِذَ بَعْضُنَا بَعْضاً أَرْبَاباً مِّن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ فَإِن تَوَلَّوْاْ فَقُولُواْ ٱشْهَدُواْ بِأَنَّا مُسْلِمُونَ,Say ‘O People of the Scripture! Jews and Christians come now to a word agreed upon sawā’ is the verbal noun meaning mustawin amruhā ‘a word regarding which the matter is upright’ between us and you and it is that we worship none but God allā is made up of an-lā ‘that…not’ and that we do not associate anything with Him and do not take each other for lords beside God’ as you have taken rabbis and monks; and if they turn their backs in rejection of God’s Oneness say you to them ‘Bear witness that we have submitted’ that we are of those who affirm the Oneness of God.
يٰأَهْلَ ٱلْكِتَابِ لِمَ تُحَآجُّونَ فِيۤ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَمَآ أُنزِلَتِ ٱلتَّورَاةُ وَٱلإنْجِيلُ إِلاَّ مِن بَعْدِهِ أَفَلاَ تَعْقِلُونَ,When the Jews claimed that Abraham was Jewish and that they were following his religion and the Christians made a similar claim the following was revealed O People of the Scripture! Why do you argue about dispute over Abraham? claiming that he belonged to one of your two religions when the Torah was not revealed neither the Gospel but a very long time after him and it was only after these two were revealed that Jewry and Christianity came into being. What do you not comprehend? the falsehood of what you say?
هٰأَنْتُمْ هَؤُلاۤءِ حَاجَجْتُمْ فِيمَا لَكُم بِهِ عِلمٌ فَلِمَ تُحَآجُّونَ فِيمَا لَيْسَ لَكُمْ بِهِ عِلْمٌ وَٱللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ وَأَنْتُمْ لاَ تَعْلَمُونَ,Lo! hā ‘lo’ is for calling attention to something You antum ‘you’ is the subject are those the predicate is what follows who dispute about what you know concerning the affair of Moses and Jesus and your claim to be adhering to their religions why do you then dispute concerning that of which you have no knowledge? of Abraham’s circumstances; and God knows his circumstances and you know not.
مَا كَانَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ يَهُودِيّاً وَلاَ نَصْرَانِيّاً وَلَكِن كَانَ حَنِيفاً مُّسْلِماً وَمَا كَانَ مِنَ ٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ,God in order to dissociate Abraham from their claims said No; Abraham in truth was not a Jew neither a Christian but he was a Muslim professing the Oneness of God and a hanīf who inclined away from all other religions towards the upright one; and he was never of the idolaters.
إِنَّ أَوْلَى ٱلنَّاسِ بِإِبْرَاهِيمَ لَلَّذِينَ ٱتَّبَعُوهُ وَهَـٰذَا ٱلنَّبِيُّ وَٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَٱللَّهُ وَلِيُّ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,Surely the people with the best claim most worthy of Abraham are those who followed him during his time and this Prophet Muhammad (s) on account of his according with him as regards most of the rulings of his Law and those who believe from among his community they are the ones that ought to say ‘We follow his religion’ and not you; and God is the Protector of the believers their Helper and Preserver.
وَدَّت طَّآئِفَةٌ مِّنْ أَهْلِ ٱلْكِتَابِ لَوْ يُضِلُّونَكُمْ وَمَا يُضِلُّونَ إِلاَّ أَنْفُسَهُمْ وَمَا يَشْعُرُونَ,When the Jews called Mu‘ādh b. Jabal Hudhayfa b. al-Yamān and ‘Ammār b. Yāsir to join their religion the following was revealed There is a party of the People of the Scripture who yearn to make you go astray; yet they cause none to stray except themselves because the sin for their leading others astray falls upon them while the believers do not heed them in this; but they are not aware of this.
يٰأَهْلَ ٱلْكِتَابِ لِمَ تَكْفُرُونَ بِآيَاتِ ٱللَّهِ وَأَنْتُمْ تَشْهَدُونَ,O People of the Scripture! Why do you disbelieve in God’s verses the Qur’ān that includes all the descriptions of Muhammad (s) when you yourselves bear witness? when you know that it is the truth.
يٰأَهْلَ ٱلْكِتَابِ لِمَ تَلْبِسُونَ ٱلْحَقَّ بِٱلْبَاطِلِ وَتَكْتُمُونَ ٱلْحَقَّ وَأَنْتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ,O People of the Scripture! Why do you confound why do you mix truth with falsehood by distorting and falsifying scripture and conceal the truth the descriptions of the Prophet while you know? that it is the truth?
وَقَالَتْ طَّآئِفَةٌ مِّنْ أَهْلِ ٱلْكِتَابِ آمِنُواْ بِٱلَّذِيۤ أُنْزِلَ عَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَجْهَ ٱلنَّهَارِ وَٱكْفُرُوۤاْ آخِرَهُ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ,A party of the People of the Scripture the Jews say to some among them ‘Believe in what has been revealed to those who believe that is the Qur’ān at the beginning of the day and disbelieve in it at the end of it so that they the believers might then turn back from his Muhammad’s religion and that they the believers will then say these Jews are knowledgeable and they could only have turned away from it after accepting it because they know it to be false.
وَلاَ تُؤْمِنُوۤاْ إِلاَّ لِمَن تَبِعَ دِينَكُمْ قُلْ إِنَّ ٱلْهُدَىٰ هُدَى ٱللَّهِ أَن يُؤْتَىۤ أَحَدٌ مِّثْلَ مَآ أُوتِيتُمْ أَوْ يُحَآجُّوكُمْ عِندَ رَبِّكُمْ قُلْ إِنَّ ٱلْفَضْلَ بِيَدِ ٱللَّهِ يُؤْتِيهِ مَن يَشَآءُ وَٱللَّهُ وَاسِعٌ عَلِيمٌ,And they also said And do not believe except in one who the lām of li-man ‘in one who’ is extra follows accords with your religion’. God exalted be He says Say to them O Muhammad (s) ‘True guidance is God’s guidance that is Islam everything else being error this statement is parenthetical — that an and what follows is the direct object of the verb wa-lā tu’minū ‘do not believe’ anyone should be given the like of what you have been given of the Book wisdom and of the virtues the term ahad ‘anyone’ from whom the exclusion is being made precedes that which is being excluded ‘the like of what you have been given’ the meaning being ‘Do not affirm that anyone should be given this unless they follow your religion’; or that they the believers should dispute with you that they should prevail over you before your Lord’ on the Day of Resurrection for you have the sounder religion a variant reading has a-an ‘such that’ the extra hamza denoting rebuke in other words the Jews say do not believe that another has been given the like of it such that you might affirm it. God exalted be He says Say ‘Surely bounty is in God’s Hand; He gives it to whomever He will so how can you say that no one else will be given what you have been given? God is Embracing of ample bounty Knowing those who deserve it.
يَخْتَصُّ بِرَحْمَتِهِ مَن يَشَآءُ وَاللَّهُ ذُو الْفَضْلِ الْعَظِيمِ,He singles out for His mercy whom He will; God is of bounty abounding’.
وَمِنْ أَهْلِ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ مَنْ إِن تَأْمَنْهُ بِقِنْطَارٍ يُؤَدِّهِ إِلَيْكَ وَمِنْهُمْ مَّنْ إِن تَأْمَنْهُ بِدِينَارٍ لاَّ يُؤَدِّهِ إِلَيْكَ إِلاَّ مَا دُمْتَ عَلَيْهِ قَآئِماً ذٰلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ قَالُواْ لَيْسَ عَلَيْنَا فِي ٱلأُمِّيِّينَ سَبِيلٌ وَيَقُولُونَ عَلَى اللَّهِ ٱلْكَذِبَ وَهُمْ يَعْلَمُونَ,And of the People of the Scripture is he who if you trust him with a hundredweight that is with much money he will return it to you on account of his trustworthiness the like of ‘Abd Allāh b. Salām to whom a man entrusted 1200 plates of gold which he then returned to him; and of them is he who if you trust him with one dinar will not return it to you on account of his treachery; unless you keep standing over him not leaving him for one minute for as soon as you leave him he will deny it as was the case with Ka‘b b. al-Ashraf to whom a man from Quraysh entrusted a dinar and later denied it. That refusal to return things is because they say ‘We have no duty towards namely no possibility of acquiring sin because of the Gentiles’ the Arabs; for they considered it lawful to be unjust towards any person of a different religion and they attributed the source of this conviction to God exalted be He. God exalted be He says They speak falsehood against God by attributing such things to Him while they are aware that they are liars.
بَلَىٰ مَنْ أَوْفَىٰ بِعَهْدِهِ وَاتَّقَى فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ يُحِبُّ الْمُتَّقِينَ,Nay there is a duty incumbent over them in this regard; but whoever fulfils his covenant the one he has made or the covenant of God by restoring a trust and other such things and has fear of God by refraining from disobedience and performing deeds of obedience for truly God loves the God-fearing ‘He loves them’ means that He will reward them the overt noun al-muttaqīn ‘the God-fearing’ has replaced the third person pronominalisation.
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يَشْتَرُونَ بِعَهْدِ ٱللَّهِ وَأَيْمَانِهِمْ ثَمَناً قَلِيلاً أُوْلَـٰئِكَ لاَ خَلاَقَ لَهُمْ فِي ٱلآخِرَةِ وَلاَ يُكَلِّمُهُمُ ٱللَّهُ وَلاَ يَنظُرُ إِلَيْهِمْ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ وَلاَ يُزَكِّيهِمْ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,The following was revealed with regard to the Jews when they distorted the descriptions of the Prophet s and God’s covenant with them in the Torah and God’s covenant with them regarding one that swears an oath to a falsehood when bearing witness or when selling merchandise Those that sell exchange God’s covenant with them that they believe in the Prophet and return faithfully what has been entrusted to them and their own oaths their invoking God’s name in mendacity for a small price of this world there shall be no share no lot for them in the Hereafter; and God shall not speak to them out of wrath against them nor look upon them nor have mercy upon them on the Day of Resurrection nor will He purify them cleanse them and theirs will be a painful chastisement.
وَإِنَّ مِنْهُمْ لَفَرِيقاً يَلْوُونَ أَلْسِنَتَهُمْ بِٱلْكِتَابِ لِتَحْسَبُوهُ مِنَ ٱلْكِتَابِ وَمَا هُوَ مِنَ الْكِتَابِ وَيَقُولُونَ هُوَ مِنْ عِندِ اللَّهِ وَمَا هُوَ مِنْ عِندِ ٱللَّهِ وَيَقُولُونَ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ ٱلْكَذِبَ وَهُمْ يَعْلَمُونَ,And there is a group a party of them the People of the Scripture like Ka‘b b. al-Ashraf who twist their tongues with the Book altering it by reciting it not according to the way in which it was revealed but according to the way in which they have distorted it as in the case of the descriptions of the Prophet s and other similar matters; so that you may suppose it such distortion as part of the Book that God revealed; yet it is not part of the Book; and they say ‘It is from God’ yet it is not from God and they speak falsehood against God while they know that they are liars.
مَا كَانَ لِبَشَرٍ أَن يُؤْتِيهُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ وَٱلْحُكْمَ وَٱلنُّبُوَّةَ ثُمَّ يَقُولَ لِلنَّاسِ كُونُواْ عِبَاداً لِّي مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ وَلَـٰكِن كُونُواْ رَبَّـٰنِيِّينَ بِمَا كُنتُمْ تُعَلِّمُونَ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ وَبِمَا كُنْتُمْ تَدْرُسُونَ,When the Christians of Najrān claimed that Jesus had commanded them to take him as a Divinity and some Muslims asked that they should be permitted to prostrate themselves before him the Prophet s the following was revealed It belongs not to any mortal that God should give him the Book the Judgement the understanding of the Divine Law prophethood then that he should say to men ‘Be servants to me instead of God.’ Rather he should say ‘Be masters scholars labouring rabbāniyyūn ‘those of the Lord’ is derived from rabb ‘lord’ with the extra alif and nūn as a superlative of rabbiyyūn by virtue of what you know ta‘lamūn also read as tu‘allimūn ‘you teach’ of the Book and in what you study’ that is on account of the fact that you used to do this for its benefit is that you engage in action.
وَلاَ يَأْمُرَكُمْ أَن تَتَّخِذُواْ ٱلْمَلاَئِكَةَ وَٱلنَّبِيِّيْنَ أَرْبَاباً أَيَأْمُرُكُم بِٱلْكُفْرِ بَعْدَ إِذْ أَنْتُمْ مُّسْلِمُونَ,He would never order you read lā ya’murukum to denote a new clause meaning ‘God would not order you’; or if read lā ya’murakum it would be a supplement to yaqūla ‘he should say’ meaning ‘it belongs not that… a mortal should order you’; to take the angels and the prophets as lords in the way that the Sabaeans have taken the angels the Jews Ezra and the Christians Jesus. Would He order you to disbelieve after you have submitted? He would not do this.
وَإِذْ أَخَذَ ٱللَّهُ مِيثَاقَ ٱلنَّبِيِّيْنَ لَمَآ آتَيْتُكُم مِّن كِتَابٍ وَحِكْمَةٍ ثُمَّ جَآءَكُمْ رَسُولٌ مُّصَدِّقٌ لِّمَا مَعَكُمْ لَتُؤْمِنُنَّ بِهِ وَلَتَنصُرُنَّهُ قَالَ أَأَقْرَرْتُمْ وَأَخَذْتُمْ عَلَىٰ ذٰلِكُمْ إِصْرِي قَالُوۤاْ أَقْرَرْنَا قَالَ فَٱشْهَدُواْ وَأَنَاْ مَعَكُمْ مِّنَ ٱلشَّاهِدِينَ,And mention when God made a covenant with the prophets ‘What if read lamā it would be introducing a subject clause and emphasising the aspect of the oath in this ‘making of the covenant’; if it is read limā it would then be connected to the verb akhadha ‘He took’; the mā ‘what’ is a relative particle in both cases meaning la’lladhī or li’lladhī respectively I have given you ātaytukum or in a variant reading ātaynākum ‘We have given you’ of the Book and wisdom; then there shall come to you a messenger confirming what is with you of the Book and wisdom and that is Muhammad (s) — you shall believe in him and you shall help him’ this constitutes the response to the oath if you reach his time and perceive him and their communities of descendants follow them in what is incumbent upon them. He God exalted be He said to them ‘Do you affirm this? And do you take do you accept My load My covenant on you on that condition?’ They said ‘We affirm’. He said ‘Then bear witness to this before your own souls and those of your followers and I shall be with you among the witnesses’ before you and them.
فَمَنْ تَوَلَّىٰ بَعْدَ ذٰلِكَ فَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْفَاسِقُونَ,Then whoever turns his back in rejection after that covenant they are the wicked.
أَفَغَيْرَ دِينِ ٱللَّهِ يَبْغُونَ وَلَهُ أَسْلَمَ مَن فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ طَوْعاً وَكَرْهاً وَإِلَيْهِ يُرْجَعُونَ,What! Do they the ones who turn away desire yabghūna is also read tabghūna ‘do you desire?’ other than God’s religion when to Him has submitted to Him has yielded whoever is in the heavens and the earth willingly without refusal or unwillingly by the sword and by seeing what it such refusal results in and to Him they shall be returned? yurja‘ūna may also be read turja‘ūna ‘you shall be returned’; the hamza at the beginning of the verse a-fa-ghayra ‘what…other’ denotes a disavowal.
قُلْ آمَنَّا بِٱللَّهِ وَمَآ أُنزِلَ عَلَيْنَا وَمَآ أُنزِلَ عَلَىٰ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَإِسْمَاعِيلَ وَإِسْحَاقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ وَٱلأَسْبَاطِ وَمَا أُوتِيَ مُوسَىٰ وَعِيسَىٰ وَٱلنَّبِيُّونَ مِن رَّبِّهِمْ لاَ نُفَرِّقُ بَيْنَ أَحَدٍ مِّنْهُمْ وَنَحْنُ لَهُ مُسْلِمُونَ,Say to them O Muhammad (s) ‘We believe in God and that which has been revealed to us and that which has been revealed to Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the Tribes the latter’s sons; and in that which was given to Moses and Jesus and the prophets from their Lord; we make no division between any of them by believing in some and disbelieving in others; and to Him we submit’ devoting worship sincerely to Him.
وَمَن يَبْتَغِ غَيْرَ ٱلإِسْلاَمِ دِيناً فَلَنْ يُقْبَلَ مِنْهُ وَهُوَ فِي ٱلآخِرَةِ مِنَ ٱلْخَاسِرِينَ,The following was revealed regarding those who apostatized and became disbelievers Whoever desires a religion other than Islam it shall not be accepted from him and in the Hereafter he shall be among the losers because he will end up in the Fire made everlasting for him.
كَيْفَ يَهْدِي ٱللَّهُ قَوْماً كَفَرُواْ بَعْدَ إِيمَانِهِمْ وَشَهِدُوۤاْ أَنَّ ٱلرَّسُولَ حَقٌّ وَجَآءَهُمُ ٱلْبَيِّنَاتُ وَٱللَّهُ لاَ يَهْدِي ٱلْقَوْمَ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ,How shall God guide that is to say He shall not guide a people who have disbelieved after their belief and bore witness that is and after their bearing witness that the Messenger is true and after the clear signs the manifest proofs of the truth of the Prophet had come to them? God guides not the evildoing that is the disbelieving folk.
أُوْلَـٰئِكَ جَزَآؤُهُمْ أَنَّ عَلَيْهِمْ لَعْنَةَ ٱللَّهِ وَٱلْمَلاۤئِكَةِ وَٱلنَّاسِ أَجْمَعِينَ,Those — their requital is that there shall rest on them the curse of God and of the angels and of men altogether.
خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا لاَ يُخَفَّفُ عَنْهُمُ ٱلْعَذَابُ وَلاَ هُمْ يُنظَرُونَ,Abiding therein that is in the curse or in the Fire implied by it the curse; the chastisement shall not be lightened for them and they shall not be reprieved they shall not be given any respite.
إِلاَّ ٱلَّذِينَ تَابُواْ مِن بَعْدِ ذٰلِكَ وَأَصْلَحُواْ فَإِنَّ الله غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,But those who repent thereafter and make amends in their actions then truly God is Forgiving Merciful to them.
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ بَعْدَ إِيمَانِهِمْ ثُمَّ ٱزْدَادُواْ كُفْراً لَّن تُقْبَلَ تَوْبَتُهُمْ وَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلضَّآلُّونَ,The following was revealed regarding the Jews Surely those who disbelieve in Jesus after they have believed in Moses and then increase in unbelief in Muhammad (s) — their repentance shall not be accepted when they are drawing their last gasps of life or when they have died as disbelievers; those are the ones who go astray.
إِنَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَمَاتُواْ وَهُمْ كُفَّارٌ فَلَن يُقْبَلَ مِنْ أَحَدِهِم مِّلْءُ ٱلأَرْضِ ذَهَباً وَلَوِ ٱفْتَدَىٰ بِهِ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ وَمَا لَهُمْ مِّن نَّاصِرِينَ,Surely those who disbelieve and die disbelieving the whole earth full the amount needed to fill it up of gold shall not be accepted from any one of them the fā’ of fa-lan yuqbala ‘it shall not be accepted’ has been included in the predicate of the inna clause because the statement about alladhīna ‘those who disbelieve’ resembles a conditional statement; and as a declaration of the reason for it repentance not being acceptable in the case of one who dies in unbelief if he would ransom himself thereby; for them awaits a painful chastisement alīm is the same as mu’lim ‘painful’ and they shall have no helpers to protect them from it.
لَن تَنَالُواْ ٱلْبِرَّ حَتَّىٰ تُنْفِقُواْ مِمَّا تُحِبُّونَ وَمَا تُنْفِقُواْ مِن شَيْءٍ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ بِهِ عَلِيمٌ,You will not attain piety that is the reward for it which is Paradise until you expend until you give voluntary alms of what you love of your wealth; and whatever thing you expend God knows of it and He will requite it accordingly.
كُلُّ ٱلطَّعَامِ كَانَ حِـلاًّ لِّبَنِيۤ إِسْرَائِيلَ إِلاَّ مَا حَرَّمَ إِسْرَائِيلُ عَلَىٰ نَفْسِهِ مِن قَبْلِ أَن تُنَزَّلَ ٱلتَّوْرَاةُ قُلْ فَأْتُواْ بِٱلتَّوْرَاةِ فَٱتْلُوهَا إِن كُنتُمْ صَادِقِينَ,When the Jews said to the Prophet ‘You claim that you follow the creed of Abraham but Abraham did not eat camel’s meat nor drink its milk’ the following was revealed All food was lawful to the Children of Israel save what Israel Jacob forbade for himself namely camels when he was afflicted with sciatica ‘irq al-nasā he made a vow that if he were cured he would not eat of it again and so it was forbidden him; before the Torah was revealed which was after the time of Abraham as it was not unlawful in his time as they claimed. Say to them ‘Bring the Torah now and recite it so that the truth of what you say may become clear if you are truthful’ in what you say; they were stupified and did not bring it the Torah. God exalted be He then said
فَمَنِ ٱفْتَرَىٰ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ ٱلْكَذِبَ مِن بَعْدِ ذَلِكَ فَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلظَّالِمُونَ,Whoever invents falsehood against God after that that is after the proof has become manifest that the prohibition was made by Jacob and not during the time of Abraham those are the evildoers that transgress the truth into falsehood.
قُلْ صَدَقَ ٱللَّهُ فَٱتَّبِعُواْ مِلَّةَ إِبْرَاهِيمَ حَنِيفاً وَمَا كَانَ مِنَ ٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ,Say ‘God has spoken the truth in this matter just as He has in all that He has related; therefore follow the creed of Abraham the one which I follow a hanīf inclining away from all religions towards submission islām and he was not an idolater’.
إِنَّ أَوَّلَ بَيْتٍ وُضِعَ لِلنَّاسِ لَلَّذِي بِبَكَّةَ مُبَارَكاً وَهُدًى لِّلْعَالَمِينَ,When they said ‘Our direction of prayer qibla came before yours’ the following was revealed The first house for worship established for the people on earth was that at Bakka a variant of Makka Mecca so called because it ‘crushes’ tabukku the necks of tyrants; it was built by the angels before the creation of Adam and after it the Aqsā in Jerusalem was built a period of forty years separating them as reported in the hadīth of the two Sahīhs sc. of al-Bukhārī and Muslim and in the hadīth that states ‘The first thing to appear on the surface of the water at the creation of the heavens and the earth was a white foam underneath which the earth was unrolled’; a blessed place mubārakan a circumstantial qualifier referring to la’lladhī ‘that’ meaning a place of blessings and a guidance to all worlds because it is their qibla.
فِيهِ ءَايَٰتٌ بَيِّنَـٰتٌ مَّقَامُ إِبْرَٰهِيمَ وَمَن دَخَلَهُ كَانَ آمِناً وَللَّهِ عَلَى ٱلنَّاسِ حِجُّ ٱلْبَيْتِ مَنِ ٱسْتَطَاعَ إِلَيْهِ سَبِيلاً وَمَن كَفَرَ فَإِنَّ ٱلله غَنِيٌّ عَنِ ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ,Therein are clear signs among which is the station of Abraham that is the stone upon which he stood to build the House and on which his footprints remain; and it the House has endured all this length of time and the constant passing of hands over it. Among these signs are the fact that the reward for good deeds is multiplied in it and that birds never fly over it; and whoever enters it is in security not liable therein to be killed or oppressed or otherwise. It is the duty of people towards God to make the pilgrimage to the House read either as hijj al-bayt or hajj al-bayt as two variants of the verbal noun from hajj meaning ‘the intention to journey there’ if he is able to make his way there man istatā‘a ilayhi sabīlan substitutes for al-nās ‘people’. The Prophet s explained this ability as having provisions and a ride as reported by al-Hākim al-Naysābūrī and others. As for the one who disbelieves in God or in what He has made obligatory with regard to the Pilgrimage God is Independent of all worlds the humans the jinn and the angels and is Independent of their devotions.
قُلْ يٰأَهْلَ ٱلْكِتَابِ لِمَ تَكْفُرُونَ بِآيَاتِ ٱللَّهِ وَٱللَّهُ شَهِيدٌ عَلَى مَا تَعْمَلُونَ,Say ‘O People of the Scripture why do you disbelieve in God’s verses that is the Qur’ān when God is Witness of what you do?’ and will requite you for it?
قُلْ يٰأَهْلَ ٱلْكِتَابِ لِمَ تَصُدُّونَ عَن سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ مَنْ آمَنَ تَبْغُونَهَا عِوَجاً وَأَنْتُمْ شُهَدَآءُ وَمَا ٱللَّهُ بِغَافِلٍ عَمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ,Say ‘O People of the Scripture why do you bar believers causing them to turn away from God’s way His religion by denying the truth of the Prophet and concealing His graces desiring to make it crooked ‘iwajan is the verbal noun meaning mu‘awwajatan ‘made crooked’ inclining away from the truth while you yourselves are witnesses while you know that the religion which is upright and pleasing to God is that of Islam as stated in your Book? God is not heedless of what you do’ in the way of unbelief and mendacity; instead He gives you respite until your appointed time and then requites you.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُوۤاْ إِن تُطِيعُواْ فَرِيقاً مِّنَ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ ٱلْكِتَابَ يَرُدُّوكُم بَعْدَ إِيمَانِكُمْ كَافِرِينَ,The following was revealed when the Jews passed by the Aws and the Khazraj and were infuriated by their comradeship and set about reminding them of their mutual hostility in the days before Islam such that they caused them to quarrel and the two tribes were on the verge of fighting one another O you who believe if you obey a party of those who have been given the Scripture they will turn you after you have believed into disbelievers.
وَكَيْفَ تَكْفُرُونَ وَأَنْتُمْ تُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْكُمْ آيَاتُ ٱللَّهِ وَفِيكُمْ رَسُولُهُ وَمَن يَعْتَصِم بِٱللَّهِ فَقَدْ هُدِيَ إِلَىٰ صِرَاطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ,How can you disbelieve this is an interrogative of amazement and rebuke while you have God’s verses recited to you and His Messenger is in your midst? Whoever holds fast to clings to God he is guided to a straight path.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ ٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ حَقَّ تُقَاتِهِ وَلاَ تَمُوتُنَّ إِلاَّ وَأَنْتُمْ مُّسْلِمُونَ,O you who believe fear God as He should be feared so that He is obeyed and not disobeyed thanked and not shown ingratitude remembered and not forgotten. They said ‘Who O Messenger of God is strong enough for this task?’ But it was then abrogated by His statement So fear God as much as you can Q. 6416; and do not die except as Muslims professing the Oneness of God.
وَٱعْتَصِمُواْ بِحَبْلِ ٱللَّهِ جَمِيعاً وَلاَ تَفَرَّقُواْ وَٱذْكُرُواْ نِعْمَتَ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ إِذْ كُنْتُمْ أَعْدَآءً فَأَلَّفَ بَيْنَ قُلُوبِكُمْ فَأَصْبَحْتُمْ بِنِعْمَتِهِ إِخْوَاناً وَكُنْتُمْ عَلَىٰ شَفَا حُفْرَةٍ مِّنَ ٱلنَّارِ فَأَنقَذَكُمْ مِّنْهَا كَذٰلِكَ يُبَيِّنُ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمْ آيَاتِهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَهْتَدُونَ,And hold fast to clutch God’s bond namely His religion together and do not scatter after submitting to Islam; remember God’s grace His bestowing of favours upon you O companies of the Aws and the Khazraj when you were enemies and He brought your hearts together through Islam so that by His grace you became brothers in religion and comradeship; and you were upon the brink the edge of a pit of fire such that to fall into it you only had to die disbelieving; but He delivered you from it through belief. So just as He has made clear for you what has been mentioned God makes clear to you His signs that you might be guided.
وَلْتَكُن مِّنْكُمْ أُمَّةٌ يَدْعُونَ إِلَى ٱلْخَيْرِ وَيَأْمُرُونَ بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ وَيَنْهَوْنَ عَنِ ٱلْمُنْكَرِ وَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْمُفْلِحُونَ,Let there be one community of you calling to good to Islam and enjoining decency and forbidding indecency; those that call bid and forbid are the successful the victorious the particle min ‘of’ in minkum ‘of you’ is partitive since what is mentioned is a collective obligation fard kifāya and is not incumbent upon every individual of the community for not every person such as the ignorant is up to it. However it is also said that this particle is extra and what is meant is ‘so that you are a community calling to good and so on’.
وَلاَ تَكُونُواْ كَٱلَّذِينَ تَفَرَّقُواْ وَٱخْتَلَفُواْ مِن بَعْدِ مَا جَآءَهُمُ ٱلْبَيِّنَاتُ وَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ عَظِيمٌ,Be not as those who scattered in their religion and disputed over it after the clear proofs came to them and these are the Jews and the Christians those there awaits a mighty chastisement.
يَوْمَ تَبْيَضُّ وُجُوهٌ وَتَسْوَدُّ وُجُوهٌ فَأَمَّا ٱلَّذِينَ ٱسْوَدَّتْ وُجُوهُهُمْ أَكْفَرْتُمْ بَعْدَ إِيمَانِكُمْ فَذُوقُواْ ٱلْعَذَابَ بِمَا كُنْتُمْ تَكْفُرُونَ,The day when some faces are blackened and some faces whitened that is the Day of Resurrection. As for those whose faces are blackened these being the disbelievers who are thrown into the Fire and to whom it is said in rebuke ‘Did you disbelieve after you had believed on the day the covenant was made? Then taste the chastisement for what you disbelieved!’
وَأَمَّا ٱلَّذِينَ ٱبْيَضَّتْ وُجُوهُهُمْ فَفِي رَحْمَةِ ٱللَّهِ هُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ,But as for those whose faces are whitened and these are the believers they shall be in God’s mercy that is to say in Paradise abiding therein.
تِلْكَ آيَاتُ ٱللَّهِ نَتْلُوهَا عَلَيْكَ بِٱلْحَقِّ وَمَا ٱللَّهُ يُرِيدُ ظُلْماً لِّلْعَالَمِينَ,Those that is to say these verses are the verses of God which We recite to you O Muhammad (s) in truth and God desires not any injustice for the worlds punishing them for no crime.
وَللَّهِ مَا فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَإِلَىٰ ٱللَّهِ تُرْجَعُ ٱلأُمُورُ,To God belongs all that is in the heavens and in the earth as possessions creatures and servants and to Him all matters are returned.
كُنْتُمْ خَيْرَ أُمَّةٍ أُخْرِجَتْ لِلنَّاسِ تَأْمُرُونَ بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ وَتَنْهَوْنَ عَنِ ٱلْمُنْكَرِ وَتُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱللَّهِ وَلَوْ آمَنَ أَهْلُ ٱلْكِتَابِ لَكَانَ خَيْراً لَّهُمْ مِّنْهُمُ ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ وَأَكْثَرُهُمُ ٱلْفَاسِقُونَ,You O community of Muhammad (s) are the best community brought forth manifested to men according to God’s knowledge enjoining decency and forbidding indecency and believing in God. Had the People of the Scripture believed it their belief would have been better for them; some of them are believers such as ‘Abd Allāh b. Salām may God be pleased with him and his companions; but most of them the disbelievers are wicked.
لَن يَضُرُّوكُمْ إِلاَّ أَذًى وَإِن يُقَاتِلُوكُمْ يُوَلُّوكُمُ ٱلأَدْبَارَ ثُمَّ لاَ يُنصَرُونَ,They the Jews will not harm you O company of Muslims in any way except a little hurt with their tongues such as slander and threats; and if they fight against you they will turn their backs to you in retreat then they will not be helped against you but you will be helped against them.
ضُرِبَتْ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلذِّلَّةُ أَيْنَ مَا ثُقِفُوۤاْ إِلاَّ بِحَبْلٍ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَحَبْلٍ مِّنَ ٱلنَّاسِ وَبَآءُوا بِغَضَبٍ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَضُرِبَتْ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلْمَسْكَنَةُ ذٰلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ يَكْفُرُونَ بِآيَاتِ ٱللَّهِ وَيَقْتُلُونَ ٱلأَنْبِيَآءَ بِغَيْرِ حَقٍّ ذٰلِكَ بِمَا عَصَوْاْ وَّكَانُواْ يَعْتَدُونَ,Abasement shall be cast upon them wherever they are found so that they have no strength and no protection save if they be clinging to a rope of God and a rope of the believing people this being the latter’s covenant of security for them on the condition that they pay the jizya in other words they have no protection other than this; they have incurred they have ended up with anger from God and poverty shall be cast upon them; that is because they disbelieved in God’s signs and slew the prophets without right; that dhālika is repeated for emphasis is because they disobeyed God’s command and used to transgress passing from what is lawful into what is unlawful.
لَيْسُواْ سَوَآءً مِّنْ أَهْلِ ٱلْكِتَابِ أُمَّةٌ قَآئِمَةٌ يَتْلُونَ آيَاتِ ٱللَّهِ آنَآءَ ٱللَّيْلِ وَهُمْ يَسْجُدُونَ,Yet they the People of the Scripture are not all alike equal; some of the People of the Scripture are a community upright with integrity adhering to the truth such as ‘Abd Allāh b. Salām may God be pleased with him and his companions who recite God’s verses in the watches of the night that is during its hours prostrating themselves performing prayer wa-hum yasjudūn ‘prostrating themselves’ is a circumstantial qualifier.
يُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلآخِرِ وَيَأْمُرُونَ بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ وَيَنْهَوْنَ عَنِ ٱلْمُنْكَرِ وَيُسَارِعُونَ فِي ٱلْخَيْرَاتِ وَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ مِنَ ٱلصَّالِحِينَ,They believe in God and in the Last Day enjoining decency and forbidding indecency vying with one another in good works; those described in the way God has mentioned are of the righteous and some of them are not like this and are not righteous.
وَمَا يَفْعَلُواْ مِنْ خَيْرٍ فَلَنْ يُكْفَروهُ وَٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ بِٱلْمُتَّقِينَ,And whatever good you do O community taf‘alū ‘you do’ or if this is read yaf‘alū ‘they do’ then it is referring to them ‘the upright community’ you shall not be denied it read in both ways fa-lan tukfarūhu ‘you shall not be denied it’ or fa-lan yukfarūhu ‘they shall not be denied it’ you shall not be deprived of its reward but you will be rewarded for it and God knows the God-fearing.
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لَنْ تُغْنِيَ عَنْهُمْ أَمْوَالُهُمْ وَلاَ أَوْلاَدُهُمْ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ شَيْئاً وَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ أَصْحَابُ ٱلنَّارِ هُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ,As for the disbelievers their riches shall not avail protect them neither their children against God that is against His chastisement these two are singled out for mention because a person usually avails himself either by paying a ransom or by resorting to the help of his children; those are the inhabitants of the Fire abiding therein.
مَثَلُ مَا يُنْفِقُونَ فِي هَـٰذِهِ ٱلْحَيَاةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا كَمَثَلِ رِيحٍ فِيهَا صِرٌّ أَصَابَتْ حَرْثَ قَوْمٍ ظَلَمُوۤاْ أَنْفُسَهُمْ فَأَهْلَكَتْهُ وَمَا ظَلَمَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ وَلَـٰكِنْ أَنْفُسَهُمْ يَظْلِمُونَ,The likeness the description of what they the disbelievers expend in the life of this world in the way of enmity towards the Prophet or in the way of voluntary almsgiving or the like is as the likeness of a wind wherein is a blast of extreme hot or cold that smote the tillage the crops of a people who have wronged themselves through unbelief and disobedience and destroyed it so that they could not profit from it; so it is with what they expend it perishes and they profit nothing from it. God did not wrong them when they lost what they expended but they wronged themselves through unbelief which necessitated this loss.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ لاَ تَتَّخِذُواْ بِطَانَةً مِّن دُونِكُمْ لاَ يَأْلُونَكُمْ خَبَالاً وَدُّواْ مَا عَنِتُّمْ قَدْ بَدَتِ ٱلْبَغْضَآءُ مِنْ أَفْوَاهِهِمْ وَمَا تُخْفِي صُدُورُهُمْ أَكْبَرُ قَدْ بَيَّنَّا لَكُمُ الآيَاتِ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ,O you who believe do not take as intimates as sincere friends revealing to them your secret thoughts anyone apart from yourselves from among the Jews Christians and the hypocrites; such men spare nothing to ruin you khabālan is in the accusative because the preposition that usually precedes it sc. fī’l-khabāl has been omitted that is to say they would not be remiss about corrupting you; they would love they wish for you to suffer al-‘anat means extreme hardship. Hatred enmity towards you is revealed it is manifested by their mouths by sowing discord among you and informing the idolaters of your secret plans; and what their breasts conceal of enmity is yet greater. Now We have made clear to you the signs of their enmity; if you understand this then do not befriend them.
هَآأَنْتُمْ أُوْلاۤءِ تُحِبُّونَهُمْ وَلاَ يُحِبُّونَكُمْ وَتُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱلْكِتَابِ كُلِّهِ وَإِذَا لَقُوكُمْ قَالُوۤاْ آمَنَّا وَإِذَا خَلَوْاْ عَضُّواْ عَلَيْكُمُ ٱلأَنَامِلَ مِنَ ٱلْغَيْظِ قُلْ مُوتُواْ بِغَيْظِكُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلِيمٌ بِذَاتِ ٱلصُّدُورِ,Lo hā ‘lo!’ is for calling attention to something there you are O believers you love them on account of their kinship and their pretence of friendship towards you but they love you not since they oppose you in religion; you believe in the Book all of it that is to say in the Books all of them but they do not believe in your Book and when they meet you they say ‘We believe’ but when they are alone they bite at you their fingertips in rage in extreme fury at what they see of your mutual affection the biting of the fingertips is used to figuratively express the severity of rage even if there be no biting involved. Say ‘Perish in your rage that is be this way until the end of your lives for you shall not see what will please you; God knows what is in the breasts’ what is in the hearts including that which these conceal.
إِن تَمْسَسْكُمْ حَسَنَةٌ تَسُؤْهُمْ وَإِن تُصِبْكُمْ سَيِّئَةٌ يَفْرَحُواْ بِهَا وَإِن تَصْبِرُواْ وَتَتَّقُواْ لاَ يَضُرُّكُمْ كَيْدُهُمْ شَيْئاً إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ بِمَا يَعْمَلُونَ مُحِيطٌ,If good fortune a favour such as victory or booty befalls you it is evil for them it grieves them; but if evil such as defeat or drought befalls you they rejoice thereat the conditional statement here is semantically connected to the previous conditional and what comes in between is a parenthetical statement the meaning being that their enmity towards you is endless so why do you befriend them? Avoid them! Yet if you endure their harm and fear God by not befriending them and so on their guile will not hurt you read either lā yadirkum or lā yadurrukum at all; God encompasses what they do ya‘malūn or may be read ta‘malūn ‘what you do’ He has knowledge of it and will requite them for it.
وَإِذْ غَدَوْتَ مِنْ أَهْلِكَ تُبَوِّىءُ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ مَقَاعِدَ لِلْقِتَالِ وَٱللَّهُ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ,And mention O Muhammad (s) when you went forth at dawn from your family at Medina to assign the believers to have them occupy their places stations for them to stand at for battle and God hears what you say knows your circumstances this was the day of the battle of Uhud. The Prophet s set out with 1000 or 950 men while the idolaters numbered 3000. The Prophet pitched camp at the ravine on Saturday 7th of Shawwāl in year 3 of the Hijra. He had his back and that of his troops to Uhud. He arranged their lines and placed a group of archers under the command of ‘Abd Allāh b. Jubayr at the foot of the mountain and said to them ‘Defend us with your arrows in case they come up from behind us and remain here whether we are being defeated or on the verge of victory’.
إِذْ هَمَّتْ طَّآئِفَتَانِ مِنكُمْ أَن تَفْشَلاَ وَٱللَّهُ وَلِيُّهُمَا وَعَلَى ٱللَّهِ فَلْيَتَوَكَّلِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ,When idh substitutes for the previous idh two parties of you the Banū Salima and the Banū Hāritha the two flanks of the army were about to lose heart about to shrink from the battle and retreat after ‘Abd Allāh b. Ubayy the hypocrite and his companions began to retreat. He Ibn Ubayy said ‘Why should we get ourselves and our children killed?’ and he also said to Abū Jābir al-Salamī — who had said to him ‘I implore you by God for your Prophet’s sake and yours’ — ‘If we knew how to fight we would follow you!’ But God then made them the Banū Salima and the Banū Hāritha steadfast and they did not abandon the field; and God was their Protector their Helper and let the believers rely on God let them place their trust in Him and none other.
وَلَقَدْ نَصَرَكُمُ ٱللَّهُ بِبَدْرٍ وَأَنْتُمْ أَذِلَّةٌ فَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ,When they were defeated the following was revealed as a way of reminding them of God’s favour God already gave you victory at Badr a location between Mecca and Medina when you were contemptible few in number and weapons. So fear God in order that you might be thankful for His blessings.
إِذْ تَقُولُ لِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ أَلَنْ يَكْفِيكُمْ أَن يُمِدَّكُمْ رَبُّكُمْ بِثَلاَثَةِ ءَالَٰفٍ مِّنَ ٱلْمَلاۤئِكَةِ مُنزَلِينَ,When idh an adverbial qualifier of nasarakum ‘He gave you victory’ in the previous verse you were saying to the believers promising them as reassurance for them ‘Is it not sufficient for you that your Lord should reinforce you that He should succour you with three thousand angels sent down? read munzalīn or munazzalīn ‘sent down’.
بَلَىۤ إِن تَصْبِرُواْ وَتَتَّقُواْ وَيَأْتُوكُمْ مِّن فَوْرِهِمْ هَـٰذَا يُمْدِدْكُمْ رَبُّكُمْ بِخَمْسَةِ ءَالَٰفٍ مِّنَ ٱلْمَلاۤئِكَةِ مُسَوِّمِينَ,Yea it is sufficient for you. In sūrat al-Anfāl it is stated with a thousand Q. 89 because at first He reinforced them with this thousand then it became three thousand then five thousand as God says if you are patient in encountering the enemy and fear God in not contravening His command and they the idolaters come against you instantly your Lord will reinforce you with five thousand angels accoutred’ read musawimmīn or musawammīn that is to say distinctively marked for the battle. Indeed they were patient and God fulfilled His promise to them so that the angels fought together with them riding upon piebald horses wearing yellow or white turbans let loose down to their shoulders.
وَمَا جَعَلَهُ ٱللَّهُ إِلاَّ بُشْرَىٰ لَكُمْ وَلِتَطْمَئِنَّ قُلُوبُكُمْ بِهِ وَمَا ٱلنَّصْرُ إِلاَّ مِنْ عِندِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلْعَزِيزِ ٱلْحَكِيمِ,What God ordained that is of reinforcement was only as a good tiding to you of victory and that your hearts might be at peace that they might be at rest and not be terrified by the large number of the enemy as compared to your small number. Victory comes only from God the Mighty the Wise He gives it to whomever He will and victory comes not because of a large army.
لِيَقْطَعَ طَرَفاً مِّنَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوۤاْ أَوْ يَكْبِتَهُمْ فَيَنقَلِبُواْ خَآئِبِينَ,And that He might cut off li-yaqta‘ is semantically connected to the clause containing nasarakum ‘He gave you victory’ that is to say that He might destroy a party of the disbelievers by slaying them or making them fall captive or suppress them humiliate them through defeat so that they fall back return frustrated not having secured what they desired.
لَيْسَ لَكَ مِنَ ٱلأَمْرِ شَيْءٌ أَوْ يَتُوبَ عَلَيْهِمْ أَوْ يُعَذِّبَهُمْ فَإِنَّهُمْ ظَالِمُونَ,When on the Day of Uhud the Prophet received a head wound and his front tooth was broken and he said ‘How does a people who have drenched the face of their Prophet in blood expect to prosper?’ the following was revealed It is no concern at all of yours nay it is God’s concern so be patient whether meaning until such time as He relents to them through their acceptance of Islam or chastises them; for they are indeed evildoers by virtue of their disbelief.
وَللَّهِ مَا فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِي ٱلأَرْضِ يَغْفِرُ لِمَن يَشَآءُ وَيُعَذِّبُ مَن يَشَآءُ وَٱللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,To God belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth as possessions creatures and servants; He forgives whom He wills forgiveness for and chastises whom He wills chastisement for. And God is Forgiving of His friends Merciful to those who obey Him.
يَٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ لاَ تَأْكُلُواْ ٱلرِّبَٰواْ أَضْعَٰفاً مُّضَٰعَفَةً وَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ,O you who believe do not exact usury twofold and severalfold read mudā‘afatan or mud‘afatan by increasing the amount to be repaid when the loan period comes to an end and delaying the request of the loan. And fear God by abandoning such usury so that you may prosper that you may triumph.
وَٱتَّقُواْ ٱلنَّارَ ٱلَّتِيۤ أُعِدَّتْ لِلْكَافِرِينَ,And fear the Fire that has been prepared for the disbelievers lest you be chastised with it.
وَأَطِيعُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَٱلرَّسُولَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُرْحَمُونَ,And obey God and the Messenger so that you may find mercy.
وَسَارِعُوۤاْ إِلَىٰ مَغْفِرَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَجَنَّةٍ عَرْضُهَا ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتُ وَٱلأَرْضُ أُعِدَّتْ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ,And vie with one another hastening read wa-sāri‘ū or simply sāri‘ū to forgiveness from your Lord and to a garden as wide as the heavens and the earth that is as broad as both of them together if put side by side breadth denotes ampleness that has been prepared for those who fear God in being obedient and abandoning acts of disobedience.
ٱلَّذِينَ يُنفِقُونَ فِي السَّرَّآءِ وَٱلضَّرَّآءِ وَٱلْكَاظِمِينَ ٱلْغَيْظَ وَٱلْعَافِينَ عَنِ ٱلنَّاسِ وَٱللَّهُ يُحِبُّ ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,Who expend in obedience to God in prosperity and adversity in times of ease and difficulty and restrain their rage and desist from following it up even though they are able to and pardon their fellow-men those who wrong them waiving their punishment; and God loves those who are virtuous through such actions that is to say He will reward them.
وَٱلَّذِينَ إِذَا فَعَلُواْ فَاحِشَةً أَوْ ظَلَمُوۤاْ أَنْفُسَهُمْ ذَكَرُواْ ٱللَّهَ فَٱسْتَغْفَرُواْ لِذُنُوبِهِمْ وَمَن يَغْفِرُ ٱلذُّنُوبَ إِلاَّ ٱللَّهُ وَلَمْ يُصِرُّواْ عَلَىٰ مَا فَعَلُواْ وَهُمْ يَعْلَمُونَ,And who when they commit an indecency a despicable sin such as adultery or wrong themselves with less than that such as a kiss remember God that is to say His threat of punishment and pray forgiveness for their sins — and who that is none shall forgive sins but God? — and who do not persist persevere in what they did but have desisted from it knowing that what they did was sinful.
أُوْلَـٰئِكَ جَزَآؤُهُمْ مَّغْفِرَةٌ مِّن رَّبِّهِمْ وَجَنَّاتٌ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلأَنْهَارُ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا وَنِعْمَ أَجْرُ ٱلْعَامِلِينَ,Those — their requital is forgiveness from their Lord and Gardens beneath which rivers flow abiding therein khālidīna fīhā an implied situation that is it is foreordained that they will abide in it once they enter it; excellent is the wage this wage of those workers of obedience!
قَدْ خَلَتْ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ سُنَنٌ فَسِيرُواْ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ فَٱنْظُرُواْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَاقِبَةُ ٱلْمُكَذِّبِينَ,The following was revealed regarding the defeat at Uhud Ways of life have passed away before you all manner of unbelief has preceded where they have been given respite but are then seized with punishment; so travel in the land O believers and behold how was the end of those who denied the messengers that is how their affair ended in destruction. So do not grieve on account of their victory I am only giving them respite until their appointed time.
هَـٰذَا بَيَانٌ لِّلنَّاسِ وَهُدًى وَمَوْعِظَةٌ لِّلْمُتَّقِينَ,This Qur’ān is an exposition for all mankind and a guidance from error and an admonition for such as are God-fearing among them.
وَلاَ تَهِنُوا وَلاَ تَحْزَنُوا وَأَنْتُمُ الأَعْلَوْنَ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ مُّؤْمِنِينَ,Faint not shrink not from fighting the disbelievers neither grieve for what befell you at Uhud for you shall prevail through victory over them if you are truly believers. the response to this last conditional clause is the sum meaning of what has preceded it.
إِن يَمْسَسْكُمْ قَرْحٌ فَقَدْ مَسَّ ٱلْقَوْمَ قَرْحٌ مِّثْلُهُ وَتِلْكَ ٱلأَيَّامُ نُدَاوِلُهَا بَيْنَ ٱلنَّاسِ وَلِيَعْلَمَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَيَتَّخِذَ مِنكُمْ شُهَدَآءَ وَٱللَّهُ لاَ يُحِبُّ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ,If a wound touches you befalls you at Uhud a like wound qarh or qurh which is the exhaustion that results from a wound and the like already at Badr has touched the other people the disbelievers. Such days We deal out in turn We dispense them among mankind one day for one group the next day for another that they might be admonished and that God may know through knowledge manifested outwardly those who believe who are sincere in their faith from others; and that He may take witnesses from among you honouring them with martyrdom and God loves not the evildoers the disbelievers that is He will chastise them and the blessings He bestows upon them are only a means of drawing out their punishment.
وَلِيُمَحِّصَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَيَمْحَقَ ٱلْكَافِرِينَ,And that God may prove the believers purifying them of sins through what befalls them and efface that is destroy the disbelievers.
أَمْ حَسِبْتُمْ أَن تَدْخُلُواْ ٱلْجَنَّةَ وَلَمَّا يَعْلَمِ ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِينَ جَاهَدُواْ مِنكُمْ وَيَعْلَمَ ٱلصَّابِرِينَ,Or nay did you suppose you should enter Paradise without God knowing through knowledge manifested outwardly who among you have struggled and who are patient in times of hardship?
وَلَقَدْ كُنْتُمْ تَمَنَّوْنَ ٱلْمَوْتَ مِن قَبْلِ أَن تَلْقَوْهُ فَقَدْ رَأَيْتُمُوهُ وَأَنْتُمْ تَنظُرُونَ,You were longing for tamannawna one of the two letters tā’ has been omitted from the original tatamannawna death before you met it when you said ‘Would that we had a day like the Day of Badr in order to attain what its martyrs attained.’ Now you have seen it that is the cause of it war looking on that is with your eyes open and contemplating the conditions so why did you retreat?
وَمَا مُحَمَّدٌ إِلاَّ رَسُولٌ قَدْ خَلَتْ مِن قَبْلِهِ ٱلرُّسُلُ أَفإِنْ مَّاتَ أَوْ قُتِلَ ٱنْقَلَبْتُمْ عَلَىٰ أَعْقَابِكُمْ وَمَن يَنقَلِبْ عَلَىٰ عَقِبَيْهِ فَلَن يَضُرَّ ٱللَّهَ شَيْئاً وَسَيَجْزِي ٱللَّهُ ٱلشَّاكِرِينَ,With regard to their being routed when it was rumoured that the Prophet had been killed and the hypocrites had said to the believers ‘If he has been killed go back to your previous religion’ the following was revealed Muhammad is only a messenger; messengers have passed away before him. Why if he should die or is slain like others will you turn back on your heels will you return to unbelief the last statement is the locus of the interrogative of denial in other words ‘he was not a worshipped being so that if he were to die you should turn back to your previous religion’. If any man should turn back on his heels he will not harm God in any way but will be harming himself and God will requite those that are thankful for His graces by staying firm.
وَمَا كَانَ لِنَفْسٍ أَنْ تَمُوتَ إِلاَّ بِإِذْنِ ٱللهِ كِتَٰباً مُّؤَجَّلاً وَمَن يُرِدْ ثَوَابَ ٱلدُّنْيَا نُؤْتِهِ مِنْهَا وَمَن يُرِدْ ثَوَابَ ٱلآخِرَةِ نُؤْتِهِ مِنْهَا وَسَنَجْزِي ٱلشَّٰكِرِينَ,It is not for any soul to die save by the leave of God by His decree a prescribed kitāban here a verbal noun that is God has prescribed this term that is to say a term fixed in time neither brought forward nor deferred so why did you retreat in defeat? Defeat does not ward off death nor does standing one’s ground sever life. And whoever desires by his deeds the reward of this world that is his requital in it We will give him of it what has been alloted to him but he shall have no share in the Hereafter; and whoever desires the reward of the Hereafter We will give him of it that is of its reward; and We will requite the thankful.
وَكَأَيِّن مِّن نَّبِيٍّ قَاتَلَ مَعَهُ رِبِّيُّونَ كَثِيرٌ فَمَا وَهَنُواْ لِمَآ أَصَابَهُمْ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ وَمَا ضَعُفُواْ وَمَا ٱسْتَكَانُواْ وَٱللَّهُ يُحِبُّ ٱلصَّابِرِينَ,How many a prophet has been killed qutila a variant reading has qātala ‘has fought’ the subject of the verb being the person governing it and with him ma‘ahu the predicate the subject of which follows thousands manifold fought but they fainted not they did not shrink in the face of what afflicted them in God’s way of wounds and the slaying of their prophets and companions; they neither weakened in the face of struggle nor did they humble themselves nor did they succumb to their enemy as you did when it was said that the Prophet s had been killed. And God loves the patient during trials meaning that He will reward them.
وَمَا كَانَ قَوْلَهُمْ إِلاَّ أَن قَالُواْ ربَّنَا ٱغْفِرْ لَنَا ذُنُوبَنَا وَإِسْرَافَنَا فِيۤ أَمْرِنَا وَثَبِّتْ أَقْدَامَنَا وٱنْصُرْنَا عَلَى ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلْكَافِرِينَ,All that they said when their prophet had been killed while they stood their ground and were steadfast was ‘Our Lord forgive us our sins and our excesses our overstepping the bounds in our affairs a declaration of the fact that what had befallen them was the result of their evil actions and a humbling of their selves and make firm our feet with strength for the struggle and help us against the unbelieving folk’.
فَآتَاهُمُ ٱللَّهُ ثَوَابَ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَحُسْنَ ثَوَابِ ٱلآخِرَةِ وَٱللَّهُ يُحِبُّ ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,And God gave them the reward of this world victory and booty and the fairest reward of the Hereafter that is Paradise husnuhu ‘the fairest of it’ denotes extra favour in addition to what is deserved; and God loves the virtuous.
يَا أَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُوۤاْ إِن تُطِيعُواْ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ يَرُدُّوكُمْ عَلَىٰ أَعْقَابِكُمْ فَتَنقَلِبُواْ خَاسِرِينَ,O you who believe if you obey the disbelievers in what they command you they will make you turn back on your heels back to unbelief and you will revert as losers.
بَلِ ٱللَّهُ مَوْلاَكُمْ وَهُوَ خَيْرُ ٱلنَّاصِرِينَ,Nay but God is your Protector your Helper and He is the best of helpers so obey only Him and not them.
سَنُلْقِي فِي قُلُوبِ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ ٱلرُّعْبَ بِمَآ أَشْرَكُواْ بِٱللَّهِ مَا لَمْ يُنَزِّلْ بِهِ سُلْطَاناً وَمَأْوَاهُمُ ٱلنَّارُ وَبِئْسَ مَثْوَىٰ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ,We will cast terror read ru‘b or ru‘ub into the hearts of the disbelievers after departing from Uhud they resolved to return in order to exterminate the Muslims but they were terrified and did not return; for what they have associated because of their associating with God that for which He has revealed no warrant that is no argument in support of its worship namely idols; their abode shall be the Fire; evil is the abode the resting place of the evildoers the disbelievers.
وَلَقَدْ صَدَقَكُمُ ٱللَّهُ وَعْدَهُ إِذْ تَحُسُّونَهُمْ بِإِذْنِهِ حَتَّىٰ إِذَا فَشِلْتُمْ وَتَنَازَعْتُمْ فِي ٱلأَمْرِ وَعَصَيْتُمْ مِّن بَعْدِ مَآ أَرَاكُمْ مَّا تُحِبُّونَ مِنكُم مَّن يُرِيدُ الدُّنْيَا وَمِنكُم مَّن يُرِيدُ ٱلآخِرَةَ ثُمَّ صَرَفَكُمْ عَنْهُمْ لِيَبْتَلِيَكُمْ وَلَقَدْ عَفَا عَنْكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ ذُو فَضْلٍ عَلَى ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,God has been true to His promise towards you of giving you victory when you slew them by His leave by His will until you lost heart until you shrank from battle and quarrelled disagreed over the command that is the command of the Prophet s that you remain at the foot of the mountain for the arrow attack some of you saying ‘Let us depart for our comrades have been given victory’ others saying ‘We should not disobey the command of the Prophet s’; and you disobeyed his command and abandoned your station in search of the booty after He God had shown you what you longed for of assistance the response to the clause containing idhā is indicated by what precedes it that is to say ‘when you lost heart He denied you His assistance’. Some of you desired this world abandoning his station for the sake of the booty; and some of you desired the Hereafter holding to it until he was slain such as ‘Abd Allāh b. Jubayr and his companions. Then He turned you away thumma sarafakum is a supplement to the response of the clause containing idhā implied to be raddakum bi’l-hazīma ‘He turned you back in defeat’ from them the disbelievers so that He might try you that He might test you and so make manifest the sincere ones from those otherwise; yet now He has pardoned you what you have done and God is Bounteous to the believers with pardon.
إِذْ تُصْعِدُونَ وَلاَ تَلْوُونَ عَلَىٰ أحَدٍ وَٱلرَّسُولُ يَدْعُوكُمْ فِيۤ أُخْرَٰكُمْ فَأَثَـٰبَكُمْ غَمّاً بِغَمٍّ لِّكَيْلاَ تَحْزَنُواْ عَلَىٰ مَا فَاتَكُمْ وَلاَ مَآ أَصَـٰبَكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ خَبِيرٌ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ,Remember when you were ascending fleeing in the distance not turning around not stopping for anyone and the Messenger was calling you from your rear saying ‘Come to me servants of God this way servants of God!’ so He rewarded you He requited you with grief through defeat for grief ghamman bi-ghamm; the bā’ bi- ‘with’ is said to mean ‘alā ‘for’ because of the grief that you caused the Prophet when you disobeyed his command that is with grief doubled being in addition to the grief of the booty forfeited so that li-kaylā is semantically connected either to ‘afā ‘He has pardoned’ or athābakum ‘He rewarded you’; the lā of kay-lā is thus extra you might not grieve for what escaped you of booty neither for what befell you of being slain and of defeat; and God is aware of what you do.
ثُمَّ أَنزَلَ عَلَيْكُمْ مِّن بَعْدِ ٱلْغَمِّ أَمَنَةً نُّعَاساً يَغْشَىٰ طَآئِفَةً مِّنْكُمْ وَطَآئِفَةٌ قَدْ أَهَمَّتْهُمْ أَنْفُسُهُمْ يَظُنُّونَ بِٱللَّهِ غَيْرَ ٱلْحَقِّ ظَنَّ ٱلْجَٰهِلِيَّةِ يَقُولُونَ هَل لَّنَا مِنَ ٱلأَمْرِ مِن شَيْءٍ قُلْ إِنَّ ٱلأَمْرَ كُلَّهُ للَّهِ يُخْفُونَ فِيۤ أَنْفُسِهِم مَّا لاَ يُبْدُونَ لَكَ يَقُولُونَ لَوْ كَانَ لَنَا مِنَ ٱلأَمْرِ شَيْءٌ مَّا قُتِلْنَا هَٰهُنَا قُل لَّوْ كُنتُمْ فِي بُيُوتِكُمْ لَبَرَزَ ٱلَّذِينَ كُتِبَ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلْقَتْلُ إِلَىٰ مَضَاجِعِهِمْ وَلِيَبْتَلِيَ ٱللَّهُ مَا فِي صُدُورِكُمْ وَلِيُمَحِّصَ مَا فِي قُلُوبِكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ بِذَاتِ ٱلصُّدُورِ,Then He sent down upon you after grief security — a slumber nu‘āsan ‘slumber’ substitutes for amanatan ‘security’ overcoming yaghshā or taghshā a party of you namely the believers. They would become dizzy under their shields and their swords would fall from their hands; and a party whose own souls distressed them that is they caused them grief so that their only wish was their deliverance regardless of the Prophet and his Companions and they were unable to fall asleep these were the hypocrites; thinking wrongly of God thoughts of those thoughts during the age of ignorance the moment they thought that the Prophet had been killed or that he would not be given victory saying ‘Have we any part whatever in the affair?’ read interrogative hal as negative mā that is we have no part in the assistance which we were promised. Say to them ‘The affair belongs entirely read accusative kullahu to denote an emphasis or nominative kulluhu as a subject of a new sentence the predicate of which is what follows to God’ that is to say the decree is His He does what He wills. They conceal within their hearts what they do not disclose what they do not manifest to you saying yaqūlūna ‘saying’ is an explication of the preceding statement ‘Had we had any part in the affair we would not have been slain here’ that is to say ‘Had the choice been ours we would not have set out and thus been slain; but we were forced to set out’. Say to them ‘Even if you had been in your houses with some among you whom God had appointed that they be slain those of you for whom it had been appointed decreed that they be slain would have sallied forth would have gone forth to the places where they were to lie’ the battleground where they were to fall and they would have been slain; and their staying put at home would not have saved them for God’s decree will be inevitably. And He did what He did at Uhud that God might try that He might test what was in your breasts your hearts of sincerity or hypocrisy and that He might prove that He might distinguish what was in your hearts; and God knows what is in the breasts what is in the hearts. Nothing can be hidden from Him and He tries people only to make matters manifest for them.
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ تَوَلَّوْاْ مِنكُمْ يَوْمَ ٱلْتَقَى ٱلْجَمْعَانِ إِنَّمَا ٱسْتَزَلَّهُمُ ٱلشَّيْطَانُ بِبَعْضِ مَا كَسَبُواْ وَلَقَدْ عَفَا ٱللَّهُ عَنْهُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ حَلِيمٌ,Truly those of you who turned away from the battle the day the two hosts the Muslim host and that of the disbelievers encountered each other at Uhud the Muslims with the exception of twelve men — truly Satan made them slip with his evil insinuations through some of what they had earned of sins namely when they disobeyed the Prophet’s command; but God pardoned them; God is Forgiving to believers Forbearing hastening not against the disobedient with punishment.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ لاَ تَكُونُواْ كَٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَقَالُواْ لإِخْوَانِهِمْ إِذَا ضَرَبُواْ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ أَوْ كَانُواْ غُزًّى لَّوْ كَانُواْ عِنْدَنَا مَا مَاتُواْ وَمَا قُتِلُواْ لِيَجْعَلَ ٱللَّهُ ذٰلِكَ حَسْرَةً فِي قُلُوبِهِمْ وَٱللَّهُ يُحْيِـي وَيُمِيتُ وَٱللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ,O you who believe be not as the disbelievers that is as the hypocrites who say of their brothers that is regarding their affair when they travel in the land and then die or are on raiding campaigns ghuzzan ‘a raiding party’ is the plural of ghāzin and are then slain ‘Had they been with us they would not have died and would not have been slain’ in other words do not say as they say — so that God may make that saying of theirs as a conclusion of their affair anguish in their hearts. For God gives life and He gives death and so no staying put can prevent death and God sees what you do ta‘malūna or ya‘malūna ‘they do’ and He will requite you for it.
وَلَئِنْ قُتِلْتُمْ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ أَوْ مُتُّمْ لَمَغْفِرَةٌ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَرَحْمَةٌ خَيْرٌ مِّمَّا يَجْمَعُونَ,And if wa-la-in the lām is for oaths you are slain in God’s way in holy struggle or die read muttum or mittum from singular form māta yamūtu that is if death comes to you thereat forgiveness that is from God for your sins and mercy therefor from Him for you the clause introduced by the lām of la-maghfiratun ‘forgiveness’ is the response to the oath clause of la’in and occupies the place of the verbal action as a subject the predicate of which is what follows are better than what they amass in this world read tajma‘ūn ‘you amass’ or yajma‘ūn ‘they amass’.
وَلَئِنْ مُّتُّمْ أَوْ قُتِلْتُمْ لإِلَى ٱلله تُحْشَرُونَ,And if wa-la-in the lām is for oaths you die read in both ways muttum or mittum or are slain in the holy struggle or otherwise it is to God and to none other than Him that you shall be mustered in the Hereafter and He will requite you.
فَبِمَا رَحْمَةٍ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ لِنتَ لَهُمْ وَلَوْ كُنْتَ فَظّاً غَلِيظَ ٱلْقَلْبِ لاَنْفَضُّواْ مِنْ حَوْلِكَ فَٱعْفُ عَنْهُمْ وَٱسْتَغْفِرْ لَهُمْ وَشَاوِرْهُمْ فِي ٱلأَمْرِ فَإِذَا عَزَمْتَ فَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُحِبُّ ٱلْمُتَوَكِّلِينَ,It was by the mercy of God that you O Muhammad (s) were lenient with them that is that you showed indulgence toward them when they disobeyed you; had you been harsh ill-natured and fierce of heart brutish and coarse towards them they would have dispersed split away from about you. So pardon them pass over what they have done and ask forgiveness for them for their sins until I forgive them and consult them find out their opinions in the matter that is your affair in the battle and otherwise in order to win their hearts over and so that you may be emulated in this respect; and indeed the Prophet s would frequently consult them. And when you are resolved to carry out what you wish after counsel rely on God put your trust in Him and not in any counsel; for God loves those who rely on Him.
إِن يَنصُرْكُمُ ٱللَّهُ فَلاَ غَالِبَ لَكُمْ وَإِن يَخْذُلْكُمْ فَمَن ذَا ٱلَّذِي يَنصُرُكُم مِّنْ بَعْدِهِ وَعَلَى ٱللَّهِ فَلْيَتَوَكَّلِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ,If God helps you if He gives you assistance against your enemy as on the Day of Badr then none can overcome you; but if He forsakes you if He refrains from assisting you as on the Day of Uhud then who is there who can help you after Him? that is after His forsaking you? In other words there is no one to help you. Therefore on God and on no one else let the believers rely.
وَمَا كَانَ لِنَبِيٍّ أَنْ يَغُلَّ وَمَن يَغْلُلْ يَأْتِ بِمَا غَلَّ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ ثُمَّ تُوَفَّىٰ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ مَّا كَسَبَتْ وَهُمْ لاَ يُظْلَمُونَ,When some red velvet cloth went missing on the Day of Badr and some people began to say ‘Perhaps the Prophet took it’ the following was revealed It is not for a prophet to be fraudulent an yaghulla a variant reading has the passive an yughalla meaning to attribute ghulūl ‘fraud’ to him to be treacherous with regard to the spoils so do not presume this of him; whoever defrauds shall bring what he has defrauded on the Day of Resurrection carrying it around his neck; then every soul the fraudulent and the otherwise shall be paid in full the requital of what it has earned what it has done and they shall not be wronged a single thing.
أَفَمَنِ ٱتَّبَعَ رِضْوَانَ ٱللَّهِ كَمَن بَآءَ بِسَخَطٍ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَمَأْوَاهُ جَهَنَّمُ وَبِئْسَ ٱلْمَصِيرُ,Is he who follows God’s beatitude being obedient and not defrauding like him who is laden one who returns with God’s anger because of his disobedience and fraud whose abode is Hell? An evil journey’s end a resort it is!
هُمْ دَرَجَـٰتٌ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ وٱللَّهُ بَصِيرٌ بِمَا يَعْمَلُونَ,No! They are of degrees that is individuals of different degrees before God that is belonging to varying stations for those that follow His beatitude a reward and for those that are laden with God’s anger punishment; and God sees what they do and will requite them for it.
لَقَدْ مَنَّ ٱللَّهُ عَلَى ٱلْمُؤمِنِينَ إِذْ بَعَثَ فِيهِمْ رَسُولاً مِّنْ أَنْفُسِهِمْ يَتْلُواْ عَلَيْهِمْ آيَاتِهِ وَيُزَكِّيهِمْ وَيُعَلِّمُهُمُ ٱلْكِتَابَ وَٱلْحِكْمَةَ وَإِن كَانُواْ مِن قَبْلُ لَفِي ضَلالٍ مُّبِينٍ,Truly God was gracious to the believers when He sent to them a messenger from among their own that is to say an Arab like them not an angel or a non-Arab so that they can understand what he says and feel honoured thereby to recite to them His verses the Qur’ān and to purify them to cleanse them of sins and to teach them the Book the Qur’ān wisdom the Sunna though in is softened in place of inna that is innahum ‘though they…’ before that is before he was sent they were in clear error.
أَوَلَمَّآ أَصَـٰبَتْكُمْ مُّصِيبَةٌ قَدْ أَصَبْتُمْ مِّثْلَيْهَا قُلْتُمْ أَنَّىٰ هَـٰذَا قُلْ هُوَ مِنْ عِندِ أَنْفُسِكُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,And why when distress befell you at Uhud when seventy of you were slain and you had afflicted twice the like of it at Badr slaying seventy of them and taking another seventy captive did you say in amazement ‘How is this?’ that is how did this defeat happen to us when we are Muslims and God’s Messenger is among us the last statement annā hādhā ‘how is this?’ constitutes the locus of the interrogative of denial. Say to them ‘It is from yourselves because you abandoned your battle stations and were thus defeated. Surely God has power over everything’ including the giving of assistance and the withholding of it and He requited you for your disputing the Prophet’s command.
وَمَآ أَصَابَكُمْ يَوْمَ ٱلْتَقَى ٱلْجَمْعَانِ فَبِإِذْنِ ٱللَّهِ وَلِيَعْلَمَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,And what afflicted you the day the two hosts encountered at Uhud was by God’s leave by His will and that He might know through knowledge manifested outwardly the true believers.
وَلِيَعْلَمَ ٱلَّذِينَ نَافَقُواْ وَقِيلَ لَهُمْ تَعَالَوْاْ قَاتِلُواْ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ أَوِ ٱدْفَعُواْ قَالُواْ لَوْ نَعْلَمُ قِتَالاً لاَّتَّبَعْنَاكُمْ هُمْ لِلْكُفْرِ يَوْمَئِذٍ أَقْرَبُ مِنْهُمْ لِلإِيمَانِ يَقُولُونَ بِأَفْوَاهِهِم مَّا لَيْسَ فِي قُلُوبِهِمْ وَٱللَّهُ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا يَكْتُمُونَ,And that He might also know the hypocrites and those who when it was said to them after they had fled the fighting namely ‘Abd Allāh b. Ubayy and his companions ‘Come now fight in the way of God His enemies or defend’ us against the enemy by increasing the multitude of our fighters if you are not going to fight; they said ‘If we knew how if we were skilled enough to fight we would follow you’. God then said showing them to be liars They that day were nearer to unbelief than to belief for what they manifested of their forsaking the believers whereas before they had been outwardly nearer to belief; saying with their mouths that which was not in their hearts for even if they had known how to fight they would not have followed you. And God knows best what they hide of hypocrisy.
ٱلَّذِينَ قَالُواْ لإِخْوَانِهِمْ وَقَعَدُواْ لَوْ أَطَاعُونَا مَا قُتِلُوا قُلْ فَادْرَءُوا عَنْ أَنْفُسِكُمُ الْمَوْتَ إِن كُنْتُمْ صَادِقِينَ,Those who alladhīna substitutes for the previous alladhīna or constitutes an adjectival qualification of it said to their brothers in religion whilst they themselves had stayed put refraining from joining the struggle ‘Had they the martyrs at Uhud or those who stayed put with us obeyed us they would not have been slain’. Say to them ‘Then avert ward off death from yourselves if you speak the truth’ in that staying put delivers one from it sc. from death.
وَلاَ تَحْسَبَنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ قُتِلُواْ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ أَمْوَاتاً بَلْ أَحْيَاءٌ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ يُرْزَقُونَ,The following was revealed regarding martyrs Count not those who were slain read qutilū or quttilū in God’s way that is for the sake of His religion as dead but rather that they are living with their Lord their spirits inside green birds that take wing freely wherever they wish in Paradise as reported in a hadīth; provided for by Him with the fruits of Paradise.
فَرِحِينَ بِمَآ آتَاهُمُ ٱللَّهُ مِن فَضْلِهِ وَيَسْتَبْشِرُونَ بِٱلَّذِينَ لَمْ يَلْحَقُواْ بِهِم مِّنْ خَلْفِهِمْ أَلاَّ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلاَ هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ,Rejoicing farihīna a circumstantial qualifier referring to the person governing yurzaqūn ‘sustained’ in what God has given them of His bounty and they are rejoicing joyful for the sake of those who have not joined them but are left behind from among their believing brothers allādhīna ‘those who’ may be substituted by what follows sc. ‘rejoicing…that no fear’ that no fear shall befall them those that have not yet joined them neither shall they grieve in the Hereafter meaning they rejoice for their brothers’ future security and felicity allā of allā khawfun is an-lā meaning bi-an lā.
يَسْتَبْشِرُونَ بِنِعْمَةٍ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَفَضْلٍ وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ لاَ يُضِيعُ أَجْرَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,Joyful in grace in the reward and bounty in addition to it from God and that read wa-anna as a supplement to ni‘matin or wa-inna to denote a new clause God does not let the wage of believers go to waste but rewards them.
ٱلَّذِينَ ٱسْتَجَابُواْ للَّهِ وَٱلرَّسُولِ مِن بَعْدِ مَآ أَصَابَهُمُ ٱلْقَرْحُ لِلَّذِينَ أَحْسَنُواْ مِنْهُمْ وَٱتَّقَواْ أَجْرٌ عَظِيمٌ,Those who alladhīna is the subject responded to God and the Messenger to his call to set out for battle when Abū Sufyān and his companions wanted to resume hostilities they agreed with the Prophet s that the encounter would be at the annual market-fair of Badr a year from the date of Uhud; after the wounds had afflicted them at Uhud — the predicate of the subject alladhīna is what follows for all those who were virtuous by obeying him and feared to disobey him shall be a great wage namely Paradise.
ٱلَّذِينَ قَالَ لَهُمُ ٱلنَّاسُ إِنَّ ٱلنَّاسَ قَدْ جَمَعُواْ لَكُمْ فَٱخْشَوْهُمْ فَزَادَهُمْ إِيمَاناً وَقَالُواْ حَسْبُنَا ٱللَّهُ وَنِعْمَ ٱلْوَكِيلُ,Those to whom alladhīna substitutes for the previous alladhīna ‘those who’ or an adjectival qualification of it people that is Nu‘aym b. Mas‘ūd al-Ashja‘ī said ‘The people Abū Sufyān and his companions have gathered their multitudes against you in order to exterminate you therefore fear them’ and do not go out to encounter them; but that saying increased them in faith in their belief in God and in certainty and they said ‘God is sufficient for us He will deal fully for us with their affair; an excellent Guardian is He’ the One to whom the matter is entrusted. They thus set out with the Prophet s and arrived at the market-fair of Badr but God had cast terror into the hearts of Abū Sufyān and his followers and so they did not turn up. They the believers had merchandise with them and so they traded and made profits. God exalted be He says
فَٱنْقَلَبُواْ بِنِعْمَةٍ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَفَضْلٍ لَّمْ يَمْسَسْهُمْ سُوۤءٌ وَٱتَّبَعُواْ رِضْوَانَ ٱللَّهِ وَٱللَّهُ ذُو فَضْلٍ عَظِيمٍ,So they returned from Badr with grace and bounty from God safely and with profit and no evil touched them from any slaying or wounds; and they followed the beatitude of God by obeying Him and obeying His Messenger when they agreed to set out for the battle; and God is of bounty abounding for those that obey Him.
إِنَّمَا ذٰلِكُمُ ٱلشَّيْطَـٰنُ يُخَوِّفُ أَوْلِيَاءَهُ فَلاَ تَخَافُوهُمْ وَخَافُونِ إِن كُنتُمْ مُّؤْمِنِينَ,That namely the one saying to you ‘The people have gathered against you’ to the end of the verse is only Satan making you fear his friends the disbelievers therefore do not fear them; but fear Me lest you abandon My command if you are truly believers.
وَلاَ يَحْزُنكَ ٱلَّذِينَ يُسَارِعُونَ فِي ٱلْكُفْرِ إِنَّهُمْ لَن يَضُرُّواْ ٱللَّهَ شَيْئاً يُرِيدُ ٱللَّهُ أَلاَّ يَجْعَلَ لَهُمْ حَظّاً فِي ٱلآخِرَةِ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ عَظِيمٌ,Let them not grieve you read yuhzinka or yahzunka from 1st form hazanahu ‘he made him grieve’ an alternative expression to 4th form ahzanahu ‘he made him grieve’ those that vie with one another in unbelief succumbing to it promptly by supporting it namely the Meccans or the hypocrites in other words do not be concerned for their unbelief; they will not hurt God at all by their actions only hurting themselves. God desires not to assign them any portion any lot in the Hereafter that is in Paradise and that is why God forsook them; and theirs is a mighty chastisement in the Fire.
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱشْتَرَوُاْ ٱلْكُفْرَ بِٱلإِيمَانِ لَن يَضُرُّواْ ٱللَّهَ شَيْئاً وَلهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,Those who purchase unbelief at the price of faith that is taking it in place of it they will not hurt God at all with their unbelief and there awaits them a painful chastisement alīm means mu’lim ‘painful’.
وَلاَ يَحْسَبَنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ أَنَّمَا نُمْلِي لَهُمْ خَيْرٌ لأَنْفُسِهِمْ إِنَّمَا نُمْلِي لَهُمْ لِيَزْدَادُوۤاْ إِثْمَاً وَلَهْمُ عَذَابٌ مُّهِينٌ,And let not the disbelievers suppose read lā yahsabanna ‘let them not suppose’ or lā tahsabanna ‘do not suppose’ that what We indulge them in that is that Our indulging them in extending their terms of life and deferring them their death is better for their souls in the case of the reading yahsabanna ‘let them not suppose’ anna of anna-mā and its two operators stand in place of the two objects but only in place of the second in the case of the other reading tahsabanna ‘do not suppose’. We grant them indulgence We give them respite only that they may increase in sinfulness through frequent disobedience and theirs is a humbling chastisement one of humiliation in the Hereafter.
مَّا كَانَ ٱللَّهُ لِيَذَرَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ عَلَىٰ مَآ أَنْتُمْ عَلَيْهِ حَتَّىٰ يَمِيزَ ٱلْخَبِيثَ مِنَ ٱلطَّيِّبِ وَمَا كَانَ ٱللَّهُ لِيُطْلِعَكُمْ عَلَى ٱلْغَيْبِ وَلَكِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَجْتَبِي مِن رُّسُلِهِ مَن يَشَآءُ فَآمِنُواْ بِٱللَّهِ وَرُسُلِهِ وَإِن تُؤْمِنُواْ وَتَتَّقُواْ فَلَكُمْ أَجْرٌ عَظِيمٌ,It is not God’s purpose to leave to abandon the believers in the state in which you O people are where the sincere are intermingled with those otherwise till He shall distinguish read yamīza or yumayyiza till He separates the evil one the hypocrite from the good the believer through the burdensome obligations that will reveal this distinction — He did this on the Day of Uhud. And it is not God’s purpose to apprise you of the Unseen so that you could recognise the hypocrites from the others before the distinguishing; but God chooses He selects of His messengers whom He will apprising him of some of His Unseen as when He apprised the Prophet s of the position of the hypocrites. So believe in God and His messengers; and if you believe and guard against hypocrisy then yours shall be a great wage.
وَلاَ يَحْسَبَنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يَبْخَلُونَ بِمَآ آتَاهُمُ ٱللَّهُ مِن فَضْلِهِ هُوَ خَيْراً لَّهُمْ بَلْ هُوَ شَرٌّ لَّهُمْ سَيُطَوَّقُونَ مَا بَخِلُواْ بِهِ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ وَللَّهِ مِيرَاثُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَٱللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيرٌ,Let them not suppose read lā yahsabanna ‘let them not suppose’ or lā tahsabanna ‘do not suppose’ those who are niggardly with what God has given them of His bounty that is with His obligatory almsgiving that it their niggardliness is better for them khayrun lahum is the second direct object; the pronoun huwa ‘that it is’ is used to separate the two statements; the first direct object is bukhlahum ‘their niggardliness’ implicit before the relative clause alladhīna in the case of the reading tahsabanna sc. wa-lā tahsabanna bukhlahum ‘do not suppose their niggardliness…’ or before the pronoun huwa ‘it is’ in the case of the reading yahsabanna sc. wa-lā yahsabanna lladhīna…bukhlahum huwa khayran lahum ‘let them not suppose those who…that their niggardliness is better for them’; nay it is worse for them; what they were niggardly with namely the obligatory almsgiving of their wealth they shall have hung around their necks on the Day of Resurrection when he will have a snake around his neck biting viciously at him as reported in a hadīth; and to God belongs the inheritance of the heavens and the earth inheriting them after the annihilation of their inhabitants. And God is aware of what you do ta‘malūna also read ya‘malūna ‘they do’ and will requite you for it.
لَّقَدْ سَمِعَ ٱللَّهُ قَوْلَ ٱلَّذِينَ قَالُوۤاْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ فَقِيرٌ وَنَحْنُ أَغْنِيَآءُ سَنَكْتُبُ مَا قَالُواْ وَقَتْلَهُمُ ٱلأَنبِيَاءَ بِغَيْرِ حَقٍّ وَنَقُولُ ذُوقُواْ عَذَابَ ٱلْحَرِيقِ,Verily God has heard the saying of those namely the Jews who said ‘Indeed God is poor and we are rich’ they said this when the verse who is he that will lend God a good loan Q. 2245 was revealed adding that ‘If God were truly rich He would not be asking us for loans’. We shall write down We shall order that it be written what they have said in the scrolls containing their deeds so that they will be requited for it a variant reading for active naktubu ‘We shall write’ has the passive yuktabu ‘it shall be written’ and We shall write down their slaying read accusative qatlahum or nominative qatluhum the prophets without right and We shall say naqūlu also read yaqūlu meaning God shall say to them by the tongue of the angels in the Hereafter ‘Taste the chastisement of the Burning the Fire.
ذٰلِكَ بِمَا قَدَّمَتْ أَيْدِيكُمْ وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَيْسَ بِظَلاَّمٍ لِّلْعَبِيدِ,When they are thrown into the Fire it will be said to them That punishment is for what your hands have sent before ‘hands’ are used to designate a human being because most actions are performed with them; for God is never unjust towards His servants’ punishing them without them having sinned.
ٱلَّذِينَ قَالُوۤاْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَهِدَ إِلَيْنَا أَلاَّ نُؤْمِنَ لِرَسُولٍ حَتَّىٰ يَأْتِيَنَا بِقُرْبَانٍ تَأْكُلُهُ ٱلنَّارُ قُلْ قَدْ جَآءَكُمْ رُسُلٌ مِّن قَبْلِي بِٱلْبَيِّنَاتِ وَبِٱلَّذِي قُلْتُمْ فَلِمَ قَتَلْتُمُوهُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ صَادِقِينَ,Those alladhīna an adjectival qualification of the previous alladhīna ‘those who’ Q. 3181 same who said to Muhammad (s) ‘God has already made covenant with us in the Torah that we should not believe in any messenger accepting his truthfulness until he bring us an offering to be devoured by fire’ and so we will not believe in you until you bring us this offering namely of grazing livestock or other kind of animal one offers in sacrifice to God. If it is accepted a white fire will come down from the heaven and consume it otherwise it will remain as it is. Such a covenant was made with the Children of Israel but not in the case of Jesus and Muhammad. God exalted be He says Say to them in rebuke ‘messengers have come to you before me with clear proofs with miracles and with that which you said messengers such as Zachariah and John but you slew them the address here is for those living at the time of our Prophet Muhammad (s) even though the deed was their forefathers’ for they their descendants are content with it. Why did you slay them then if you are truthful?’ about the fact that you would believe if it the offering were brought to you.
فَإِن كَذَّبُوكَ فَقَدْ كُذِّبَ رُسُلٌ مِّن قَبْلِكَ جَآءُوا بِٱلْبَيِّنَاتِ وَٱلزُّبُرِ وَٱلْكِتَابِ ٱلْمُنِيرِ,But if they deny you so were denied messengers before you who came bearing clear proofs miracles and the Scriptures such as the scrolls of Abraham and the Illuminating the lucid Book that is the Torah and the Gospel a variant reading establishes the prefixed preposition bā’ in both words sc. bi’l-zubur wa-bi’l-kitāb l-munīr ‘with the Scriptures and with the Illuminating Book’ so be patient as they were.
كُلُّ نَفْسٍ ذَآئِقَةُ ٱلْمَوْتِ وَإِنَّمَا تُوَفَّوْنَ أُجُورَكُمْ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ فَمَن زُحْزِحَ عَنِ ٱلنَّارِ وَأُدْخِلَ ٱلْجَنَّةَ فَقَدْ فَازَ وَما ٱلْحَيَاةُ ٱلدُّنْيَا إِلاَّ مَتَاعُ ٱلْغُرُورِ,Every soul shall taste of death; you shall surely be paid in full your wages the requital of your deeds on the Day of Resurrection. Whoever is moved away distanced from the Fire and admitted to Paradise will have triumphed he will have attained his ultimate wish. Living in the life of this world is but the comfort of delusion; of inanity enjoyed for a little while then perishing.
لَتُبْلَوُنَّ فِيۤ أَمْوَالِكُمْ وَأَنْفُسِكُمْ وَلَتَسْمَعُنَّ مِنَ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ ٱلْكِتَابَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ وَمِنَ ٱلَّذِينَ أَشْرَكُوۤاْ أَذًى كَثِيراً وَإِن تَصْبِرُواْ وَتَتَّقُواْ فَإِنَّ ذٰلِكَ مِنْ عَزْمِ ٱلأُمُورِ,You shall surely be tried la-tublawunna the final nūn nominative indicator has been omitted because two nūn letters would otherwise succeed one another as has been the plural person indicator wāw where two unvocalised consonants have come together in other words you shall surely be tested in your property through the duties imposed thereupon and through the damages that affect them; and in your selves through the obligations of worship and through calamities and you shall hear from those who were given the Scripture before you the Jews and the Christians and from those who are idolaters from among the Arabs much hurt in the way of insult slander and their flirting with your women; but if you are patient through this and fear God — surely that is true resolve that is it is one of those things regarding which one must necessarily have firm resolve.
وَإِذْ أَخَذَ ٱللَّهُ مِيثَاقَ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ ٱلْكِتَابَ لَتُبَيِّنُنَّهُ لِلنَّاسِ وَلاَ تَكْتُمُونَهُ فَنَبَذُوهُ وَرَآءَ ظُهُورِهِمْ وَٱشْتَرَوْاْ بِهِ ثَمَناً قَلِيلاً فَبِئْسَ مَا يَشْتَرُونَ,And mention when God made covenant with those who had been given the Scripture that is the pledge taken from them in the Torah ‘You shall expound it read tubayyinunnahu or yubayyinunnahu ‘they shall expound it’ the Book to people and not conceal it’ read taktumūnahu ‘you shall not conceal it’ or yaktumūnahu ‘they shall not conceal it’. But they rejected it they discarded the covenant behind their backs and so they did not act in accordance with it and bought with it they took in its place a small price of this world from the debased among them enjoying supremacy over them in knowledge and they concealed it lest it the supremacy escape them; how evil is what they have bought how evil is this purchase of theirs!
لاَ تَحْسَبَنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يَفْرَحُونَ بِمَآ أَتَوْاْ وَّيُحِبُّونَ أَن يُحْمَدُواْ بِمَا لَمْ يَفْعَلُواْ فَلاَ تَحْسَبَنَّهُمْ بِمَفَازَةٍ مِّنَ ٱلْعَذَابِ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,Do not reckon that lā tahsabanna or read lā yahsabanna ‘let them not reckon’ those who rejoice in what they have brought that is in what they have done by leading people astray and who love to be praised for what they have not done in the way of adherence to the truth being themselves misguided — do not reckon them fa-lā tahsabannahum is for emphasis in the case of both readings above secure in a place where they can escape from the chastisement in the Hereafter; but instead they shall be in a place of wherein they shall be tortured and that is Hell; there shall be a painful chastisement for them in it alīm means mu’lim ‘painful’. If one reads yahsabanna ‘let them not reckon’ the two direct objects of the first h-s-b verb would be indicated by the two direct objects of the second h-s-b verb; but if one reads tahsabanna ‘do not reckon’ then only second direct object would be omitted.
وَللَّهِ مُلْكُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,To God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth the storehouses of rain sustenance vegetation and so forth and God has power over all things including the punishing of disbelievers and the saving of believers.
إِنَّ فِي خَلْقِ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَٱخْتِلاَفِ ٱلَّيلِ وَٱلنَّهَارِ لآيَاتٍ لأُوْلِي ٱلأَلْبَابِ,Surely in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the marvels contained in them and in the alternation of night and day coming and going increasing and diminishing there are signs indications of God’s power for people of pith for people possessing intellects.
ٱلَّذِينَ يَذْكُرُونَ ٱللَّهَ قِيَاماً وَقُعُوداً وَعَلَىٰ جُنُوبِهِمْ وَيَتَفَكَّرُونَ فِي خَلْقِ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ رَبَّنَآ مَا خَلَقْتَ هَذا بَاطِلاً سُبْحَانَكَ فَقِنَا عَذَابَ النَّارِ,Those who alladhīna an adjectival qualification of the preceding li-ūlī l-albāb ‘for people of pith’ or a substitution for it remember God standing and sitting and on their sides reclining that is to say in all states it is reported from Ibn ‘Abbās that they perform prayer in these ways each according to his own capacity; and reflect upon the creation of the heavens and the earth to deduce therefrom the power of their Creator saying ‘Our Lord You have not created this creation that we see in vain bātilan a circumstantial qualifier frivolously but as a proof of the totality of Your power. Glory be to You! exalted above any frivolity. So guard us against the chastisement of the Fire.
رَبَّنَآ إِنَّكَ مَن تُدْخِلِ ٱلنَّارَ فَقَدْ أَخْزَيْتَهُ وَمَا لِلظَّالِمِينَ مِنْ أَنْصَارٍ,Our Lord whomever You admit into the Fire to abide therein You will have abased You will have humiliated and the evildoers the disbelievers therein shall have no helpers to protect them from God’s chastisement exalted be He the overt noun ‘the evildoers’ has replaced the pronominalisation ‘whomever’ in order to inform that the punishment of abasement is specifically theirs; the min of min ansār ‘helpers’ is extra.
رَّبَّنَآ إِنَّنَآ سَمِعْنَا مُنَادِياً يُنَادِي لِلإِيمَانِ أَنْ آمِنُواْ بِرَبِّكُمْ فَآمَنَّا رَبَّنَا فَٱغْفِرْ لَنَا ذُنُوبَنَا وَكَفِّرْ عَنَّا سَيِّئَاتِنَا وَتَوَفَّنَا مَعَ ٱلأَبْرَارِ,Our Lord we have heard a caller calling summoning people to belief li’l-īmān means ilā l-īmān and this is Muhammad (s) or summoning them to the Qur’ān saying that “Believe in your Lord!” And we believed in Him. So our Lord forgive us our sins and absolve us of conceal our evil deeds and so do not make them manifest by punishing us for them and take us in death receive our spirits together with the pious the prophets and the righteous.
رَبَّنَا وَآتِنَا مَا وَعَدتَّنَا عَلَىٰ رُسُلِكَ وَلاَ تُخْزِنَا يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ إِنَّكَ لاَ تُخْلِفُ ٱلْمِيعَادَ,Our Lord grant us what You have promised us through the tongues of Your messengers in the way of mercy and favour they are asking Him that they be made among those that deserve such a promise for God’s promise is fufilled regardless but they are not certain that they are among those who deserve it. The repetition of the phrase our Lord is out of extreme humility; and abase us not on the Day of Resurrection. You will not fail the tryst’ the promise of Resurrection and Requital.
فَٱسْتَجَابَ لَهُمْ رَبُّهُمْ أَنِّي لاَ أُضِيعُ عَمَلَ عَامِلٍ مِّنْكُمْ مِّن ذَكَرٍ أَوْ أُنْثَىٰ بَعْضُكُم مِّن بَعْضٍ فَٱلَّذِينَ هَاجَرُواْ وَأُخْرِجُواْ مِن دِيَـٰرِهِمْ وَأُوذُواْ فِي سَبِيلِي وَقَـٰتَلُواْ وَقُتِلُواْ لأُكَفِّرَنَّ عَنْهُمْ سَيِّئَاتِهِمْ وَلأُدْخِلَنَّهُمْ جَنَّـٰتٍ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلأَنْهَـٰرُ ثَوَاباً مِّن عِندِ ٱللَّهِ وَٱللَّهُ عِندَهُ حُسْنُ ٱلثَّوَابِ,And their Lord answers them their supplication by saying that ‘I do not let the labour of any labourer among you go to waste be you male or female — the one of you is as the other this statement is a reaffirmation of the previous one that is they are both equal when it comes to recompensing them for their deeds and for not neglecting them. When Umm Salama asked ‘O Messenger of God why is there no mention of women when it comes to the Emigration hijra?’ the following was revealed and those who emigrated from Mecca to Medina and were expelled from their habitations those who suffered hurt in My way for My religion and fought the disbelievers and were slain read qutilū or quttilū — them I shall surely absolve of their evil deeds concealing these with forgiveness and I shall admit them to Gardens underneath which river flow’. A reward thawāban is a verbal noun reaffirming the import of la-ukaffiranna from God! there is a shift of person here. And God — with Him is the fairest reward the fairest requital.
لاَ يَغُرَّنَّكَ تَقَلُّبُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ فِي ٱلْبِلاَدِ,When the Muslims began to say ‘Look at the enemies of God how comfortable they are while we are struggling!’ the following was revealed Let it not delude you that the disbelievers go to and fro in the land engaging in commerce and acquiring profit
مَتَاعٌ قَلِيلٌ ثُمَّ مَأْوَاهُمْ جَهَنَّمُ وَبِئْسَ ٱلْمِهَادُ,That is but a little enjoyment which they enjoy for a short while in this world and then perishes; then their abode is Hell — an evil cradling an evil resting place it is!
لَكِنِ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱتَّقَوْاْ رَبَّهُمْ لَهُمْ جَنَّاتٌ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلأَنْهَارُ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا نُزُلاً مِّنْ عِندِ ٱللَّهِ وَمَا عِندَ ٱللَّهِ خَيْرٌ لِّلأَبْرَارِ,But those who fear their Lord — for them shall be Gardens underneath which rivers flow abiding that is it is decreed for them to abide therein; a hospitality nuzul is what is prepared for a guest; it is in the accusative nuzulan because it is a circumstantial qualifier referring to jannāt ‘gardens’ and its operator is the import of the adverbial phrase from God Himself. That which is with God in the way of reward is better for the pious than the enjoyment of this world.
وَإِنَّ مِنْ أَهْلِ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ لَمَن يُؤْمِنُ بِٱللَّهِ وَمَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكُمْ وَمَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْهِمْ خَٰشِعِينَ للَّهِ لاَ يَشْتَرُونَ بِآيَـٰتِ ٱللَّهِ ثَمَناً قَلِيلاً أُوْلـٰئِكَ لَهُمْ أَجْرُهُمْ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ سَرِيعُ ٱلْحِسَابِ,Verily there are some among the People of the Scripture who believe in God like ‘Abd Allāh b. Salām and his companions and the Negus and what has been revealed to you that is the Qur’ān and what has been revealed to them that is the Torah and the Gospel humble before God khāshi‘īn is a circumstantial qualification of the person of the verb yu’min ‘who believe’ and takes into account the potentially plural sense of man ‘who’ not purchasing with the verses of God which they have before them in the Torah and the Gospel pertaining to the descriptions of the Prophet s a small price of this world by concealing them for fear of losing their supremacy as others like the Jews have done. Those — their wage the reward for their deeds is with their Lord a reward which they will be given twice over as stated in the sūrat al-Qasas Q. 2854. God is swift at reckoning reckoning with the whole of creation in about half a day of the days of this world.
يَا أَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ ٱصْبِرُواْ وَصَابِرُواْ وَرَابِطُواْ وَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ,O you who believe be patient in performing acts of obedience in the face of afflictions and in refraining from acts of disobedience and vie in patience with the disbelievers lest they be more patient than you; be steadfast persist in the struggle; fear God in all of your circumstances so that you will prosper so that you will win admittance to Paradise and be delivered from the Fire.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّاسُ ٱتَّقُواْ رَبَّكُمُ ٱلَّذِي خَلَقَكُمْ مِّن نَّفْسٍ وَاحِدَةٍ وَخَلَقَ مِنْهَا زَوْجَهَا وَبَثَّ مِنْهُمَا رِجَالاً كَثِيراً وَنِسَآءً وَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ ٱلَّذِي تَسَآءَلُونَ بِهِ وَٱلأَرْحَامَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ عَلَيْكُمْ رَقِيباً,O people of Mecca fear your Lord that is His punishment by being obedient to Him Who created you of a single soul Adam and from it created its mate Eve Hawwā’ from one of his left ribs and from the pair of them Adam and Eve scattered separated and spread many men and many women; and fear God by whom you claim your rights from one another tassā’alūna the original tā’ of tatasā’alūna has been assimilated with the sīn; a variant reading has tasā’alūna so that one of you says to the other ‘I ask you by God…’ or ‘For God’s sake…’; and fear kinship ties lest you sever them a variant reading of wa’l-arhāma ‘and kinship ties’ is wa’l-arhāmi as a supplement to the pronoun contained in bihi sc. God. They used to implore one another by ties of kinship. Surely God has been watchful over you heedful of your deeds for which He will requite you that is to say He is ever possessed of such an attribute.
وَآتُواْ ٱلْيَتَامَىٰ أَمْوَالَهُمْ وَلاَ تَتَبَدَّلُواْ ٱلْخَبِيثَ بِٱلطَّيِّبِ وَلاَ تَأْكُلُوۤاْ أَمْوَالَهُمْ إِلَىٰ أَمْوَالِكُمْ إِنَّهُ كَانَ حُوباً كَبِيراً,The following was revealed regarding an orphan who demanded his property from his guardian but was refused it Give the orphans the under-age ones that have no father their property when they have reached maturity and do not exchange the evil the unlawful for the good the lawful that is taking the one in place of the other as you do when you take what is good from the orphan’s property and leave him your faulty property instead; and absorb not their property by adding it into your property; surely that the absorbing of it is a great crime a serious sin. When this was revealed they found it difficult to maintain guardianship over orphans and some of them had ten or eight wives under their care and did not treat them all equally and so the following was revealed
وَإِنْ خِفْتُمْ أَلاَّ تُقْسِطُواْ فِي ٱلْيَتَامَىٰ فَٱنكِحُواْ مَا طَابَ لَكُمْ مِّنَ ٱلنِّسَآءِ مَثْنَىٰ وَثُلَٰثَ وَرُبَٰعَ فَإِنْ خِفْتُمْ أَلاَّ تَعْدِلُواْ فَوَٰحِدَةً أَوْ مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَٰنُكُمْ ذٰلِكَ أَدْنَىٰ أَلاَّ تَعُولُواْ,If you fear that you will not act justly that you will not be equitable towards the orphans and are thus distressed in this matter then also fear lest you be unjust towards women when you marry them; marry such mā means man women as seem good to you two or three or four that is each man may marry two or three or four but do not exceed this; but if you fear you will not be equitable towards them in terms of their expenses and individual share; then marry only one or restrict yourself to what your right hands own of slavegirls since these do not have the same rights as wives; thus by that marrying of only four or only one or resorting to slavegirls it is likelier it is nearer in outcome that you will not be unjust that you will not be inequitable.
وَءَاتُواْ ٱلنِّسَآءَ صَدُقَٰتِهِنَّ نِحْلَةً فَإِن طِبْنَ لَكُمْ عَن شَيْءٍ مِّنْهُ نَفْساً فَكُلُوهُ هَنِيئاً مَّرِيئاً,And give women their dowries saduqāt plural of sudqa their bridal money mahr muhūr as a free gift nihlatan is a verbal noun a present given out of the kindness of one’s heart; but if they are pleased to offer you any of it of their own accord nafsan ‘of their own accord’ is for specification and is taken from the subject of the verb thus it refers back to ‘they’ the women meaning if their own selves are pleased that you should have something of the dowry and they give it to you then consume it with good wholesome appetite a praiseworthy consequence with no harm therein for you with regard to the Hereafter this was revealed in response to those who were opposed to this consumption.
وَلاَ تُؤْتُواْ ٱلسُّفَهَآءَ أَمْوَالَكُمُ ٱلَّتِي جَعَلَ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمْ قِيَٰماً وَٱرْزُقُوهُمْ فِيهَا وَٱكْسُوهُمْ وَقُولُواْ لَهُمْ قَوْلاً مَّعْرُوفاً,But do not O guardians give to the foolish the squanderers from among men women and children your property that is the property that is theirs but held by you which God has assigned to you as maintenance qiyāman ‘maintenance’ is the verbal noun from qāma; a variant reading has qiyaman the plural of qīma ‘value’ that is that with which property is valued meaning that the property which sustains your livelihoods and the well-being of your children lest they expend it improperly; provide for them thereof that is feed them from it and clothe them and speak to them decent words prepare for them a kind reception by giving them their property when they reach maturity.
وَٱبْتَلُواْ ٱلْيَتَامَىٰ حَتَّىٰ إِذَا بَلَغُواْ النِّكَاحَ فَإِنْ آنَسْتُمْ مِّنْهُمْ رُشْداً فَٱدْفَعُواْ إِلَيْهِمْ أَمْوَالَهُمْ وَلاَ تَأْكُلُوهَآ إِسْرَافاً وَبِدَاراً أَن يَكْبَرُواْ وَمَن كَانَ غَنِيّاً فَلْيَسْتَعْفِفْ وَمَن كَانَ فَقِيراً فَلْيَأْكُلْ بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ فَإِذَا دَفَعْتُمْ إِلَيْهِمْ أَمْوَالَهُمْ فَأَشْهِدُواْ عَلَيْهِمْ وَكَفَىٰ بِٱللَّهِ حَسِيباً,Try test well the orphans before reaching maturity with regard the duties of religion and before they can legally manage their own affairs until they reach the age of marrying that is until they have become eligible for it through puberty or legal age which according to al-Shāfi‘ī is the completion of fifteen years; then if you perceive in them maturity that is right judgement in matters of religion and their property deliver their property to them; consume it not O guardians wastefully without due merit and in haste that is hastening to expend it fearing lest they should grow up and become mature at which time you will be obliged to hand it over to them. If any man who is a guardian is rich let him be abstinent that is let him abstain from the orphan’s property and refrain from consuming it; if he is poor let him consume of it honourably that is in line with the wage for his work. And when you deliver to them the orphans their property take witnesses over them that they have received it and that you are absolved of the obligation so that if any dispute occurs you are able to refer to a clear proof this is a command intended for guidance. God suffices as a reckoner as a guardian of His creatures’ deeds and as a reckoner of these deeds the bā’ in bi’Llāhi is extra.
لِّلرِّجَالِ نَصيِبٌ مِّمَّا تَرَكَ ٱلْوَالِدَانِ وَٱلأَقْرَبُونَ وَلِلنِّسَآءِ نَصِيبٌ مِّمَّا تَرَكَ ٱلْوَالِدَانِ وَٱلأَقْرَبُونَ مِمَّا قَلَّ مِنْهُ أَوْ كَثُرَ نَصِيباً مَّفْرُوضاً,The following was revealed as a repudiation of pre-Islamic practices in which women and children were not given any inheritance To the men young ones and kin belongs a share a portion of what deceased parents and kinsmen leave and to the women belongs a share of what parents and kinsmen leave whether it the property be little or much. God has made it an obligatory share apportioned to be given to them.
وَإِذَا حَضَرَ ٱلْقِسْمَةَ أُوْلُواْ ٱلْقُرْبَىٰ وَٱلْيَتَامَىٰ وَٱلْمَسَاكِينُ فَٱرْزُقُوهُمْ مِّنْهُ وَقُولُواْ لَهُمْ قَوْلاً مَّعْرُوفاً,And when the division of the inheritance is attended by kinsmen those of kinship who cannot inherit and orphans and the poor grant them something out of it before the division is effected; and if the inheritors are young speak to them O guardians honourable words kindly by apologising to them that it is not your possession to divide as you wish but that it is for the young inheritors. Some say that this stipulation was abrogated; others say that it was not only that people were all too readily neglecting it since it was encouraged but not prescribed. According to Ibn ‘Abbās however it is a duty.
وَلْيَخْشَ ٱلَّذِينَ لَوْ تَرَكُواْ مِنْ خَلْفِهِمْ ذُرِّيَّةً ضِعَافاً خَافُواْ عَلَيْهِمْ فَلْيَتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَلْيَقُولُواْ قَوْلاً سَدِيداً,And let them fear let them be concerned for the orphans those who if they are about to leave behind them that is after their death weak offspring young children would be afraid for them; that they be ruined; let them fear God in the matter concerning orphans and let them give what they would love for their own offspring after their death; and speak to the one approached by death pertinent words the right words by enjoining him to give as voluntary almsgiving no more than the third of the inheritance and leave the remainder for the ones inheriting so that they do not end up as dependants.
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يَأْكُلُونَ أَمْوَالَ ٱلْيَتَٰمَىٰ ظُلْماً إِنَّمَا يَأْكُلُونَ فِي بُطُونِهِمْ نَاراً وَسَيَصْلَوْنَ سَعِيراً,Those who consume the property of orphans unjustly without any right are only consuming the whole of it as fire in their bellies because that is where such action leads and they shall be exposed to read active yaslawna or passive yuslawna that is they shall enter a blaze an intense fire in which they shall burn.
يُوصِيكُمُ ٱللَّهُ فِيۤ أَوْلَٰدِكُمْ لِلذَّكَرِ مِثْلُ حَظِّ ٱلأُنْثَيَيْنِ فَإِن كُنَّ نِسَآءً فَوْقَ ٱثْنَتَيْنِ فَلَهُنَّ ثُلُثَا مَا تَرَكَ وَإِن كَانَتْ وَاحِدَةً فَلَهَا ٱلنِّصْفُ وَلأَبَوَيْهِ لِكُلِّ وَاحِدٍ مِّنْهُمَا ٱلسُّدُسُ مِمَّا تَرَكَ إِن كَانَ لَهُ وَلَدٌ فَإِن لَّمْ يَكُنْ لَّهُ وَلَدٌ وَوَرِثَهُ أَبَوَاهُ فَلأُمِّهِ ٱلثُّلُثُ فَإِن كَانَ لَهُ إِخْوَةٌ فَلأُمِّهِ ٱلسُّدُسُ مِن بَعْدِ وَصِيَّةٍ يُوصِي بِهَآ أَوْ دَيْنٍ آبَآؤُكُمْ وَأَبناؤُكُمْ لاَ تَدْرُونَ أَيُّهُمْ أَقْرَبُ لَكُمْ نَفْعاً فَرِيضَةً مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ عَلِيماً حَكِيماً,God charges you He commands you concerning the matter of your children with what He will mention to the male of them the equivalent of the portion the lot of two females if there are two women with him so that half the property is his and the other half is theirs; if there is only one female with him then she has a third and he receives two thirds; if he is the only one he takes it all; and if they the offspring be only women more than two then for them two-thirds of what he the deceased leaves; likewise if they be two women since in the case of two sisters more deserving of such a share God says They shall receive two-thirds of what he leaves Q. 4176; and since a female is entitled to a third with a male she is all the more deserving of the same share with a female. It is said that fawq ‘more than’ introduces a relative clause; it is also said to guard against the wrong impression that the greater the number of females the greater the portion they are entitled to since it is mistakenly thought that the entitlement of two females to two-thirds derives from the fact that a female is entitled to one third when with a male; but if she the daughter be one wāhidatan is also read wāhidatun making the kāna construction syntactically complete then to her a half; and to his parents the deceased’s to each one of the two li-kulli wāhidin minhumā substitutes for the previous li-abawayhi ‘to his parents’ the sixth of what he leaves if he has a child male or female the point of the substitution is to show that they do not share the sixth but receive one each. The term ‘child’ walad also applies to a grandchild and likewise ‘parent’ abb to a grandparent; but if he has no child and his heirs are his parents alone or along with a spouse then to his mother read li-ummihi; also read in both places here and further down li-immihi in order to avoid the cumbersome transition from a damma ‘u’ to a kasra ‘I’ a third of the property or what remains after the spouse the rest being for the father; or if he has siblings two or more males or females to his mother a sixth and the rest for the father and nothing for the siblings.
وَلَكُمْ نِصْفُ مَا تَرَكَ أَزْوَٰجُكُمْ إِنْ لَّمْ يَكُنْ لَّهُنَّ وَلَدٌ فَإِن كَانَ لَهُنَّ وَلَدٌ فَلَكُمُ ٱلرُّبُعُ مِمَّا تَرَكْنَ مِن بَعْدِ وَصِيَّةٍ يُوصِينَ بِهَآ أَوْ دَيْنٍ وَلَهُنَّ ٱلرُّبُعُ مِمَّا تَرَكْتُمْ إِن لَّمْ يَكُنْ لَّكُمْ وَلَدٌ فَإِن كَانَ لَكُمْ وَلَدٌ فَلَهُنَّ ٱلثُّمُنُ مِمَّا تَرَكْتُم مِّن بَعْدِ وَصِيَّةٍ تُوصُونَ بِهَآ أَوْ دَيْنٍ وَإِن كَانَ رَجُلٌ يُورَثُ كَلَٰلَةً أَو ٱمْرَأَةٌ وَلَهُ أَخٌ أَوْ أُخْتٌ فَلِكُلِّ وَاحِدٍ مِّنْهُمَا ٱلسُّدُسُ فَإِن كَانُوۤاْ أَكْثَرَ مِن ذٰلِكَ فَهُمْ شُرَكَآءُ فِي ٱلثُّلُثِ مِن بَعْدِ وَصِيَّةٍ يُوصَىٰ بِهَآ أَوْ دَيْنٍ غَيْرَ مُضَآرٍّ وَصِيَّةً مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ حَلِيمٌ,And for you a half of what your wives leave if they have no children from you or from another; but if they have children then for you a fourth of what they leave after any bequest they may bequeath or any debt the consensus is that the grandchild in this case is like the child. And for them the wives whether one or more a fourth of what you leave if you have no children; but if you have children from them or from others then for them an eighth of what you leave after any bequest you may bequeath or any debt; again the consensus is that the grandchild is as the child. If it be a man leaving an inheritance yūrathu ‘being inherited from’ is an adjectival qualification the predicate of which is the following kalālatan ‘without direct heir’ and not having a direct heir that is having neither a parent nor child or it be a woman leaving an inheritance and having no direct heir but it be that such a man leaving an inheritance with no direct heir has a brother or a sister from the same mother as read by Ibn Mas‘ūd and others then to each of the two a sixth of what he leaves; but if they the siblings from the same mother be more than that that is more than one then they share a third the male and female equally after any bequest to be bequeathed or any debt without prejudice ghayra mudārrin is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the person governing the verb yūsā ‘to be bequeathed’ in other words without causing any prejudice to the inheritors by bequeathing more than the third; a charge wasiyyatan a verbal noun reaffirming the import of yūsīkum ‘He charges you’ of the beginning of the previous verse from God. God is Knowing of the obligations which He has ordained for His creatures Forbearing in deferring the punishment of those that disobey Him. The Sunna specifies that the individuals mentioned may receive the relevant inheritance provided that they are not barred from it on account of their having committed murder or their belonging to a different religion or being slaves.
تِلْكَ حُدُودُ ٱللَّهِ وَمَن يُطِعِ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ يُدْخِلْهُ جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلأَنْهَارُ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا وَذٰلِكَ ٱلْفَوْزُ ٱلْعَظِيمُ,Those rulings mentioned with respect to orphans and what followed are God’s bounds His laws which He has delimited for His servants so that they may act in accordance with them and not infringe them. Whoever obeys God and His Messenger in what He has ruled He will admit him yudkhilhu or as a shift to the first person plural read nudkhilhu ‘We will admit him’ to Gardens underneath which rivers flow abiding therein; that is the great triumph.
وَمَن يَعْصِ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ وَيَتَعَدَّ حُدُودَهُ يُدْخِلْهُ نَاراً خَالِداً فِيهَا وَلَهُ عَذَابٌ مُّهِينٌ,But whoever disobeys God and His Messenger; and transgresses His bounds him He will admit read in both ways as above yudkhilhu and nudkhilhu to a Fire abiding therein and for him in it there shall be a humbling chastisement one of humiliation. In both of the last verses the singular person of the suffixed pronouns and the verbs accords with the singular form of the particle man ‘whoever’ while the plural person in khālidīn ‘abiding’ accords with its general plural import.
وَٱللاَّتِي يَأْتِينَ ٱلْفَٰحِشَةَ مِن نِّسَآئِكُمْ فَٱسْتَشْهِدُواْ عَلَيْهِنَّ أَرْبَعةً مِّنْكُمْ فَإِن شَهِدُواْ فَأَمْسِكُوهُنَّ فِي ٱلْبُيُوتِ حَتَّىٰ يَتَوَفَّاهُنَّ ٱلْمَوْتُ أَوْ يَجْعَلَ ٱللَّهُ لَهُنَّ سَبِيلاً,As for those of your women who commit lewdness adultery call four Muslim men of you to witness against them; and if they witness against them such lewdness then detain them in their houses and prevent them from mixing with people until the angels of death take them or until God appoints for them a way out of it. This was stipulated for them at the very beginning of Islam but then a way out was appointed for them through the stipulation that the virgin should receive a hundred lashes and be banished for a year and the married woman be stoned. The prescribed punishment was explained thus in the hadīth ‘Come listen to me! Come listen to me! God has now made a way out for them’ as reported by Muslim.
وَٱللَّذَانِ يَأْتِيَانِهَا مِنكُمْ فَآذُوهُمَا فَإِن تَابَا وَأَصْلَحَا فَأَعْرِضُواْ عَنْهُمَآ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ تَوَّاباً رَّحِيماً,And when two of you read wa’lladhāni or wa’lladhānni men commit it that is a lewd act adultery or homosexual intercourse punish them both with insults and beatings with sandals; but if they repent of this lewd act and make amends through good action then leave them be and do not harm them. God ever turns relenting to those who repent and is Merciful to them. This verse is abrogated by the prescribed punishment if adultery is meant by the lewd act and similarly if homosexual intercourse is meant according to al-Shāfi‘ī; but according to him the person who is the object of the penetrative act is not stoned even if he be married; rather he is flogged and banished. Judging by the dual person pronoun it seems more obvious that homosexual fornication is meant by this verse even though the former sc. al-Shāfi‘ī was of the opinion that it referred to an adulterer and an adulteress; but this opinion of his may be countered by the fact that the reference to the two men becomes clear on account of the particle min being attached to a masculine pronoun minkum ‘of you’ and by the fact that they suffer the same punishment both effect the action of repentance and are both granted that they be left alone thereafter all of which applies specifically to men given that for women detention is stipulated as was stated before.
إِنَّمَا ٱلتَّوْبَةُ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ لِلَّذِينَ يَعْمَلُونَ ٱلسُّوۤءَ بِجَهَالَةٍ ثُمَّ يَتُوبُونَ مِن قَرِيبٍ فَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ يَتُوبُ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْهِمْ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ عَلِيماً حَكِيماً,The repentance that God accepts that is the one which He has prescribed for Himself to accept out of His bounty is only of those who do evil an act of disobedience in ignorance bi-jahālatin a circumstantial qualifier in other words ‘they are ignorant’ while they are disobeying their Lord; then repent shortly thereafter before the last gasps of death; God will relent to those He will accept their repentance. And God is ever Knowing of His creatures Wise in what He does with them.
وَلَيْسَتِ ٱلتَّوْبَةُ لِلَّذِينَ يَعْمَلُونَ ٱلسَّيِّئَاتِ حَتَّىٰ إِذَا حَضَرَ أَحَدَهُمُ ٱلْمَوْتُ قَالَ إِنِّي تُبْتُ ٱلآنَ وَلاَ ٱلَّذِينَ يَمُوتُونَ وَهُمْ كُفَّارٌ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ أَعْتَدْنَا لَهُمْ عَذَاباً أَلِيماً,Repentance is not for those who do evil deeds sins until when death approaches one of them and the pangs of death begin he says upon witnessing his predicament ‘Indeed now I repent’ for this would not avail him and would not be accepted from him; neither for those who die disbelieving if they repent in the Hereafter upon seeing the chastisement it will not be accepted from them. Those — We have prepared for them a painful chastisement.
يَٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ لاَ يَحِلُّ لَكُمْ أَن تَرِثُواْ ٱلنِّسَآءَ كَرْهاً وَلاَ تَعْضُلُوهُنَّ لِتَذْهَبُواْ بِبَعْضِ مَآ ءَاتَيْتُمُوهُنَّ إِلاَّ أَن يَأْتِينَ بِفَٰحِشَةٍ مُّبَيِّنَةٍ وَعَاشِرُوهُنَّ بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ فَإِن كَرِهْتُمُوهُنَّ فَعَسَىٰ أَن تَكْرَهُواْ شَيْئاً وَيَجْعَلَ ٱللَّهُ فِيهِ خَيْراً كَثِيراً,O you who believe it is not lawful for you to inherit women against their will read either karhan or kurhan as alternative forms that is to say coercing them into this. In pre-Islamic times they used to inherit women from their kin and if they so wished they could marry a woman without a dowry or marry her off and take the dowry for themselves or prevent her from marriage until she gave up what she had inherited or until she died and they could inherit from her. They were thus forbidden such practices; neither debar them your former wives from marrying others by retaining them while you have no desire for them yourselves only to harm them; so that you may go off with part of what you have given them of the dowry except when they commit flagrant read mubayyina ‘making it clear’ or mubayyana ‘clear’ lewdness such as adultery or rebellion then you have the right to coerce them until they redeem themselves to you or forfeit their dowries. Consort with them in kindness that is being decent in speaking to them with regard to their expenditure and lodging; for if you hate them then be patient; it may happen that you hate a thing wherein God has set much good that is to say perhaps He does this when He provides you with a righteous child through them.
وَإِنْ أَرَدْتُّمُ ٱسْتِبْدَالَ زَوْجٍ مَّكَانَ زَوْجٍ وَآتَيْتُمْ إِحْدَاهُنَّ قِنْطَاراً فَلاَ تَأْخُذُواْ مِنْهُ شَيْئاً أَتَأْخُذُونَهُ بُهْتَاناً وَإِثْماً مُّبِيناً,And if you desire to exchange a wife in place of another by divorcing the one and you have given to one of the spouses a hundredweight that is a large sum as dowry take of it nothing. Would you take it by way of calumny injustice and manifest sin? buhtānan ‘calumny’ and ithman ‘sin’ end in the accusative because they are circumstantial qualifiers; the interrogative here is meant as a rebuke and as a disavowal where He says
وَكَيْفَ تَأْخُذُونَهُ وَقَدْ أَفْضَىٰ بَعْضُكُمْ إِلَىٰ بَعْضٍ وَأَخَذْنَ مِنكُم مِّيثَٰقاً غَلِيظاً,How shall you take it that is by what right when each of you has been privily with the other through sexual intercourse which validates the dowry and they have taken from you a solemn covenant a binding pledge and that is what God commanded namely that they should be retained honourably or set free virtuously.
وَلاَ تَنكِحُواْ مَا نَكَحَ ءَابَآؤُكُمْ مِّنَ ٱلنِّسَآءِ إِلاَّ مَا قَدْ سَلَفَ إِنَّهُ كَانَ فَاحِشَةً وَمَقْتاً وَسَآءَ سَبِيلاً,And do not marry women whom mā means man your fathers married unless it be a thing of the past which is forgiven you; surely that marrying them is obscene vile and abominable maqtan means it results in maqt ‘severe hate’ from God an evil way an evil path is this.

وَٱلْمُحْصَنَٰتُ مِنَ ٱلنِّسَآءِ إِلاَّ مَا مَلَكْتَ أَيْمَٰنُكُمْ كِتَٰبَ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ وَأُحِلَّ لَكُمْ مَّا وَرَاءَ ذَٰلِكُمْ أَن تَبْتَغُواْ بِأَمْوَٰلِكُمْ مُّحْصِنِينَ غَيْرَ مُسَٰفِحِينَ فَمَا ٱسْتَمْتَعْتُمْ بِهِ مِنْهُنَّ فَآتُوهُنَّ أُجُورَهُنَّ فَرِيضَةً وَلاَ جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ فِيمَا تَرَٰضَيْتُمْ بِهِ مِن بَعْدِ ٱلْفَرِيضَةِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ عَلِيماً حَكِيماً,And forbidden to you are wedded women those with spouses that you should marry them before they have left their spouses be they Muslim free women or not; save what your right hands own of captured slave girls whom you may have sexual intercourse with even if they should have spouses among the enemy camp but only after they have been absolved of the possibility of pregnancy after the completion of one menstrual cycle; this is what God has prescribed for you kitāba is in the accusative because it is the verbal noun. Lawful for you read passive wa-uhilla or active wa-ahalla beyond all that that is except what He has forbidden you of women is that you seek women using your wealth by way of a dowry or a price in wedlock and not fornicating in illicitly. Such wives as you enjoy thereby and have had sexual intercourse with give them their wages the dowries that you have assigned them as an obligation; you are not at fault in agreeing together you and they after the obligation is waived decreased or increased. God is ever Knowing of His creatures Wise in what He has ordained for them.
وَمَن لَّمْ يَسْتَطِعْ مِنكُمْ طَوْلاً أَن يَنكِحَ ٱلْمُحْصَنَٰتِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنَٰتِ فَمِنْ مَّا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَٰنُكُم مِّن فَتَيَٰتِكُمُ ٱلْمُؤْمِنَٰتِ وَٱللَّهُ أَعْلَمُ بِإِيمَٰنِكُمْ بَعْضُكُمْ مِّن بَعْضٍ فَٱنكِحُوهُنَّ بِإِذْنِ أَهْلِهِنَّ وَآتُوهُنَّ أُجُورَهُنَّ بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ مُحْصَنَٰتٍ غَيْرَ مُسَٰفِحَٰتٍ وَلاَ مُتَّخِذَٰتِ أَخْدَانٍ فَإِذَآ أُحْصِنَّ فَإِنْ أَتَيْنَ بِفَٰحِشَةٍ فَعَلَيْهِنَّ نِصْفُ مَا عَلَى ٱلْمُحْصَنَٰتِ مِنَ ٱلْعَذَابِ ذَلِكَ لِمَنْ خَشِيَ ٱلْعَنَتَ مِنْكُمْ وَأَن تَصْبِرُواْ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,And whoever has not the means wherewith whoever is not wealthy enough to be able to marry believing al-mu’mināt ‘believing’ is in accordance with the prevalent practice and does not add to the import free women in wedlock let him take in marriage believing maids whom your right hands own. God knows very well your faith so suffice yourself with its outward manifestation and leave the innermost matters to Him for He is the One to know her true merit many a slavegirl may be more excellent in faith than a free woman and this is meant to encourage marriage with slavegirls; the one of you is as the other being equal in religion so do not disdain to marry with them. So marry them with the permission of their folk their guardians and give them their wages their dowries honourably without procrastination or diminution as women in wedlock muhsanāt a circumstantial qualifier in decency not illicitly openly fornicating or taking lovers companions fornicating in secret. But when they are given in wedlock when they are married off a variant reading for the passive uhsinna ‘they are given in wedlock’ has the active ahsanna ‘they enter into wedlock’ if they commit lewdness such as adultery they shall be liable to half the chastisement the legal punishment of married free virgin women who commit adultery and are thus given fifty lashes and banished for half a year; male slaves by analogy are liable to the same punishment. Here God has not made wedlock the precondition for the prescribed punishment to show that stoning does not apply in their case sc. slavegirls. That marrying of slavegirls on account of insufficient means is for those of you who fear the distress of sin fornication al-‘anat originally means distress but is used to mean zinā ‘fornication’ because of the distress that it causes in the way of the punishment in this world and in the Hereafter as opposed to those of you who might not have such a fear of distress with regard to their free women and for whom it is unlawful to marry her the slavegirl; likewise for one who has sufficient means to marry a free woman it is unlawful for him to marry a slavegirl instead this is the opinion of al-Shāfi‘ī. Moreover God’s words ‘believing maids’ precludes unbelieving women whom it is unlawful to marry even if one should find no believing women and fear the distress of fornication; yet it is better for you to be patient and abstain from marrying slavegirls lest the child should become enslaved also. God is Forgiving Merciful by allowing room for manoeuvre in these matters.
يُرِيدُ ٱللَّهُ لِيُبَيِّنَ لَكُمْ وَيَهْدِيَكُمْ سُنَنَ ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ وَيَتُوبَ عَلَيْكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ حَكِيمٌ,God desires to make clear to you the laws of your religion and what is in your best interests and to guide you in the ways the paths of those prophets before you in the way of what is lawful and what is unlawful so that you might follow them and to turn in forgiveness towards you bringing you back from the disobedience which you practised to obedience to Him; God is Knowing of you Wise in what He has ordained for you.
وَٱللَّهُ يُرِيدُ أَن يَتُوبَ عَلَيْكُمْ وَيُرِيدُ ٱلَّذِينَ يَتَّبِعُونَ ٱلشَّهَوَاتِ أَن تَمِيلُواْ مَيْلاً عَظِيماً,And God desires to turn forgivingly towards you He repeats this in order to expand upon it but those who follow their passions the Jews and Christians or the Magians and adulterers desire that you deviate with a terrible deviation transgressing what is right by committing what has been forbidden you so that you might be like them.
يُرِيدُ ٱللَّهُ أَن يُخَفِّفَ عَنْكُمْ وَخُلِقَ ٱلإِنسَانُ ضَعِيفاً,God desires to lighten things for you and make the rulings of the Law easier for you; for man was created weak unable to abstain from women and passions.
يَٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ لاَ تَأْكُلُوۤاْ أَمْوَٰلَكُمْ بَيْنَكُمْ بِٱلْبَٰطِلِ إِلاَّ أَن تَكُونَ تِجَٰرَةً عَن تَرَاضٍ مِّنْكُمْ وَلاَ تَقْتُلُوۤاْ أَنْفُسَكُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ بِكُمْ رَحِيماً,O you who believe consume not your goods between you wrongly unlawfully according to the Law through usury or usurpation except it be trading tijāratan also read tijāratun so that the goods be from trade effected through mutual agreement through mutual good-will such goods you may consume. And kill not yourselves by committing what leads towards destruction on account of some affiliation be it in this world or the Hereafter. Surely God is ever Merciful to you when He forbids you such things.
وَمَن يَفْعَلْ ذٰلِكَ عُدْوَاناً وَظُلْماً فَسَوْفَ نُصْلِيهِ نَاراً وَكَانَ ذٰلِكَ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ يَسِيراً,And whoever does that which he has been forbidden through aggression ‘udwānan a circumstantial qualifier transgressing what is lawful and injustice zulman reiterated for emphasis him We shall certainly expose admit to a fire wherein he shall burn; and that for God is an easy matter.
إِن تَجْتَنِبُواْ كَبَآئِرَ مَا تُنْهَوْنَ عَنْهُ نُكَفِّرْ عَنْكُمْ سَيِّئَـٰتِكُمْ وَنُدْخِلْكُمْ مُّدْخَلاً كَرِيماً,If you avoid the grave sins that are forbidden you those for which the threat of punishment has been prescribed like murder fornication or theft — according to Ibn ‘Abbās these number as much as seven hundred — We will absolve you of your minor evil deeds on account of your acts of obedience and admit you by an honourable gate read mudkhalan or madkhalan that is by an honourable admittance or location namely Paradise.
وَلاَ تَتَمَنَّوْاْ مَا فَضَّلَ ٱللَّهُ بِهِ بَعْضَكُمْ عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ لِّلرِّجَالِ نَصِيبٌ مِّمَّا ٱكْتَسَبُواْ وَلِلنِّسَآءِ نَصِيبٌ مِّمَّا ٱكْتَسَبْنَ وَٱسْأَلُواْ ٱللَّهَ مِن فَضْلِهِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عَلِيماً,Do not covet that in which God has preferred some of you above others in the way of worldly affairs or religion lest it lead to mutual envy and hatred. To men a share from a reward for what they have earned for their acts in the struggle and so on and to women a share from what they have earned by way of being obedient to their spouses and guarding their private parts this was revealed when Umm Salama said ‘Would that we were men so that we could join the struggle and receive the reward they receive!’ And ask read wa-s’alū or wa-salū God of His bounty what you need and He will give it to you; God is ever Knower of all things including where merit is deserved and that for which you ask.
وَلِكُلٍّ جَعَلْنَا مَوَٰلِيَ مِمَّا تَرَكَ ٱلْوَٰلِدَانِ وَٱلأَقْرَبُونَ وَٱلَّذِينَ عَقَدَتْ أَيْمَٰنُكُمْ فَآتُوهُمْ نَصِيبَهُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ شَهِيداً,To each man and woman We have appointed heirs relations to be given of that property which parents and kinsmen leave for them and to those to whom your right hands aymān plural of yamīn meaning ‘oath’ or ‘hand’ were pledged read ‘āqadat or ‘aqadat that is those allies with whom before the coming of Islam you made covenants of mutual assitance and inheritance. So give them now their share their portions of the inheritance which is a sixth. God is ever Witness over everything ever aware of it including your circumstances this verse was abrogated by His words But those related by blood are nearer to one another Q. 875 and 336.
ٱلرِّجَالُ قَوَّٰمُونَ عَلَى ٱلنِّسَآءِ بِمَا فَضَّلَ ٱللَّهُ بَعْضَهُمْ عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ وَبِمَآ أَنْفَقُواْ مِنْ أَمْوَٰلِهِمْ فَٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتُ قَٰنِتَٰتٌ حَٰفِظَٰتٌ لِّلْغَيْبِ بِمَا حَفِظَ ٱللَّهُ وَٱلَّٰتِي تَخَافُونَ نُشُوزَهُنَّ فَعِظُوهُنَّ وَٱهْجُرُوهُنَّ فِي ٱلْمَضَاجِعِ وَٱضْرِبُوهُنَّ فَإِنْ أَطَعْنَكُمْ فَلاَ تَبْغُواْ عَلَيْهِنَّ سَبِيلاً إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ عَلِيّاً كَبِيراً,Men are in charge of they have authority over women disciplining them and keeping them in check because of that with which God has preferred the one over the other that is because God has given them the advantage over women in knowledge reason authority and otherwise and because of what they expend on them the women of their property. Therefore righteous women among them are obedient to their husbands guarding in the unseen that is guarding their private parts and otherwise during their spouses’ absence because of what God has guarded for them when He enjoined their male spouses to look after them well. And those you fear may be rebellious disobedient to you when such signs appear admonish them make them fear God and share not beds with them retire to other beds if they manifest such disobedience and strike them but not violently if they refuse to desist from their rebellion after leaving them in separate beds. If they then obey you in what is desired from them do not seek a way against them a reason to strike them unjustly. God is ever High Great so beware of Him lest He punish you for treating them unjustly.
وَإِنْ خِفْتُمْ شِقَاقَ بَيْنِهِمَا فَٱبْعَثُواْ حَكَماً مِّنْ أَهْلِهِ وَحَكَماً مِّنْ أَهْلِهَآ إِن يُرِيدَآ إِصْلَٰحاً يُوَفِّقِ ٱللَّهُ بَيْنَهُمَآ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ عَلِيماً خَبِيراً,And if you fear become aware of a breach a dispute between the two the married couple the genitive construction shiqāqa baynihimā ‘any breach between the two’ is for a range of alternatives in other words shiqāqan baynihimā is the normal construction send forth for them with their consent an arbiter a just man from his folk his kinsmen and an arbiter from her folk the husband delegates to his arbiter the matter of divorce or the acceptance of compensation in its place while she delegates to her arbiter the matter of separation. The two arbiters do their best and bid the one guilty of the injustice to desist or they suggest separation if they see fit. God exalted be He says if they the two arbiters desire to set things right God will grant them the married couple success determining for them what constitutes an act of obedience be it reconciliation or separation. Surely God is ever Knower of everything Aware of what is hidden and what is manifested.
وَٱعْبُدُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَلاَ تُشْرِكُواْ بِهِ شَيْئاً وَبِٱلْوَٰلِدَيْنِ إِحْسَاناً وَبِذِي ٱلْقُرْبَىٰ وَٱلْيَتَٰمَىٰ وَٱلْمَسَٰكِينِ وَٱلْجَارِ ذِي ٱلْقُرْبَىٰ وَٱلْجَارِ ٱلْجُنُبِ وَٱلصَّاحِبِ بِٱلجَنْبِ وَٱبْنِ ٱلسَّبِيلِ وَمَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَٰنُكُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لاَ يُحِبُّ مَن كَانَ مُخْتَالاً فَخُوراً,And worship God declare His Oneness and associate nothing with Him. Be kind to parents being dutiful and gentle-mannered and near kindred and to orphans and to the needy and to the neighbour who is near to you in terms of physical vicinity or kinship and to the neighbour who is a stranger the one far from you in terms of physical vicinity or kinship; and to the friend at your side a travelling companion or a colleague at work and it is also said one’s wife; and to the wayfarer the one cut off during a journey and to what your right hands own of bondsmen. Surely God loves not the conceited the arrogant and the boastful the one who boasts before people of what he has been given.
ٱلَّذِينَ يَبْخَلُونَ وَيَأْمُرُونَ ٱلنَّاسَ بِٱلْبُخْلِ وَيَكْتُمُونَ مَآ آتَاهُمُ ٱللَّهُ مِن فَضْلِهِ وَأَعْتَدْنَا لِلْكَافِرِينَ عَذَاباً مُّهِيناً,Those alladhīna the subject who are niggardly in their duty and bid other people to be niggardly in the same and conceal what God has bestowed upon them of His bounty in the way of knowledge and property these are the Jews the predicate of the said subject is an implied lahum wa‘īdun shadīd ‘for them there is a promise of severe punishment’. And We have prepared for those that disbelieve in this and other matters a humbling chastisement one of humiliation.
وَٱلَّذِينَ يُنْفِقُونَ أَمْوَالَهُمْ رِئَـآءَ ٱلنَّاسِ وَلاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱللَّهِ وَلاَ بِٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلآخِرِ وَمَن يَكُنِ ٱلشَّيْطَانُ لَهُ قَرِيناً فَسَآءَ قِرِيناً,And those wa’lladhīna a supplement to the previous alladhīna ‘those’ who expend of their substance to show off to people to be seen of them and believe not in God and the Last Day the likes of the hypocrites and the Meccans. Whoever has Satan for a comrade for a companion whose command he follows as these do then an evil comrade has he.
وَمَاذَا عَلَيْهِمْ لَوْ آمَنُواْ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلآخِرِ وَأَنْفَقُواْ مِمَّا رَزَقَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ بِهِم عَلِيماً,And what burden is on them if they were to believe in God and the Last Day and expend of what God has provided them? that is to say what harm would this cause them? In other words there is no harm therein. Rather harm lies in what they follow the interrogative is meant as a disavowal; the law of law āmanū ‘if they were to believe’ conveys the sense of the verbal noun sc. mādhā ‘alayhim īmānuhum ‘what burden would their belief be upon them?’. God is ever Aware of them and will requite them for what they have done.
إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لاَ يَظْلِمُ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ وَإِن تَكُ حَسَنَةً يُضَٰعِفْهَا وَيُؤْتِ مِن لَّدُنْهُ أَجْراً عَظِيماً,Surely God shall not wrong anyone so much as the weight of an atom the weight of the smallest ant by diminishing thereby a person’s good deeds or increase thereby his evil deeds; and if it the atom be a good deed in taku hasanatan ‘if it be a good deed’ is also read in taku hasanatun in which case the kāna construction is syntactically complete from a believer He will double it yudā‘ifuhā also read yuda‘‘ifuhā from ten times up to more than seven hundred times and give from Himself in addition to the doubling a great wage that no one can estimate.
فَكَيْفَ إِذَا جِئْنَا مِن كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ بِشَهِيدٍ وَجِئْنَا بِكَ عَلَىٰ هَـٰؤُلاۤءِ شَهِيداً,So how shall it be the predicament of the disbelievers when We bring forward from every community a witness to testify against it regarding its deeds and this shall be its prophet; and We bring you O Muhammad (s) as witness against these?
يَوْمَئِذٍ يَوَدُّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَعَصَوُاْ ٱلرَّسُولَ لَوْ تُسَوَّىٰ بِهِمُ ٱلأَرْضُ وَلاَ يَكْتُمُونَ ٱللَّهَ حَدِيثاً,Upon that day the day of bringing forward; the disbelievers those who have disobeyed the Messenger will wish that law ‘if’ means an ‘that’ the earth might be levelled with them read passive tusawwā or active tasawwā or tassawwā so that like it they might also become dust and this is because of the terror of that day as is stated in another verse The disbeliever shall say ‘O would that I were dust!’ Q. 7840. And they will not hide from God any talk of what they did although at another stage they do actually hide it and say ‘By God our Lord we never associated anything with You’ Q. 623.
يَا أَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ لاَ تَقْرَبُواْ ٱلصَّلَٰوةَ وَأَنْتُمْ سُكَٰرَىٰ حَتَّىٰ تَعْلَمُواْ مَا تَقُولُونَ وَلاَ جُنُباً إِلاَّ عَابِرِي سَبِيلٍ حَتَّىٰ تَغْتَسِلُواْ وَإِنْ كُنْتُمْ مَّرْضَىٰ أَوْ عَلَىٰ سَفَرٍ أَوْ جَآءَ أَحَدٌ مِّنْكُمْ مِّن ٱلْغَآئِطِ أَوْ لَٰمَسْتُمُ ٱلنِّسَآءَ فَلَمْ تَجِدُواْ مَآءً فَتَيَمَّمُواْ صَعِيداً طَيِّباً فَٱمْسَحُواْ بِوُجُوهِكُمْ وَأَيْدِيكُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ عَفُوّاً غَفُوراً,O you who believe draw not near to prayer that is do not perform prayer whilst you are inebriated by a drink this was revealed concerning being drunk during the congregational prayer; until you know what you are saying when you have sobered up; nor whilst you are defiled as a result of sexual penetration or ejaculation junuban ‘defiled’ is in the accusative because it is a circumstantial qualifier and may be used to refer to the singular or plural — unless you are traversing crossing a way a route that is unless you are travelling — until you have washed yourselves in which case you may perform prayer a proviso is made for the traveller because a different stipulation applies to him as will follow. It is said that the purpose of this verse is to prohibit the approach to places of prayer that is mosques the exception being if one were merely passing through and not staying. But if you are sick with an illness made worse by contact with water or on a journey that is or travelling whilst you are ritually defiled or impure or if any of you comes from the privy al-ghā’it a place designated for relieving nature that is to say or if any of you have defecated or you have touched women lāmastum a variant reading has lamastum both mean lams that is ‘touching with the hand’ as stated by Ibn ‘Umar; this is also the opinion of al-Shāfi‘ī and it extends to touching with other parts of the skin; according to Ibn ‘Abbās however it is referring to sexual intercourse; and you can find no water with which to purify yourselves for prayer having made the effort to seek it out and search for it — the sick being exempt in this case — then resort to seek when the time for the prayer has commenced wholesome soil clean earth strike it twice and wipe your faces and your hands with it up to the elbows the verb masaha ‘to wipe’ may stand on its own with a direct object or take a particle before the direct object sc. masaha bi-. God is ever Pardoning Forgiving.
أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ نَصِيباً مِّنَ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ يَشْتَرُونَ ٱلضَّلَٰلَةَ وَيُرِيدُونَ أَن تَضِلُّواْ ٱلسَّبِيلَ,Have you not seen those who were given a share a portion of the Book namely the Jews purchasing error with guidance and desiring that you should err from the way? that you should stray from the path of truth and be like them.
وَٱللَّهُ أَعْلَمُ بِأَعْدَائِكُمْ وَكَفَىٰ بِٱللَّهِ وَلِيّاً وَكَفَىٰ بِٱللَّهِ نَصِيراً,God has better knowledge of your enemies than you do and He informs you of them in order that you avoid them. God suffices as a Protector a Preserver of you from them God suffices as a Helper defending you against their plotting.
مِّنَ ٱلَّذِينَ هَادُواْ يُحَرِّفُونَ ٱلْكَلِمَ عَن مَّوَاضِعِهِ وَيَقُولُونَ سَمِعْنَا وَعَصَيْنَا وَٱسْمَعْ غَيْرَ مُسْمَعٍ وَرَٰعِنَا لَيّاً بِأَلْسِنَتِهِمْ وَطَعْناً فِي ٱلدِّينِ وَلَوْ أَنَّهُمْ قَالُواْ سَمِعْنَا وَأَطَعْنَا وَٱسْمَعْ وَٱنْظُرْنَا لَكَانَ خَيْراً لَّهُمْ وَأَقْوَمَ وَلَكِن لَّعَنَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ بِكُفْرِهِمْ فَلاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً,Some group from among the Jews distort alter the words that God revealed in the Torah pertaining to the descriptions of Muhammad (s) from their contexts those contexts in which they were placed and they say to the Prophet s when he commands them something ‘We have heard your words and we disobey your command; and hear as one who does not hear’ wa’sma‘ ghayr musma‘in is a circumstantial qualifier functioning as an invocation in other words ‘And may you not hear!’ and they say to him ‘Mind us’ rā‘inā a term with which it had been forbidden to address him being a curse word in their language; twisting distorting with their tongues and slandering defaming religion Islam. If they had said ‘We have heard and obey’ instead of ‘And we disobey’ and only ‘Hear’ and ‘Consider us’ unzur ilaynā instead of rā‘inā it would have been better for them than what they said and more upright more just than that but God has cursed them removing them from His mercy for their unbelief so they believe not except a few among them such as ‘Abd Allāh b. Salām and his companions.
يَا أَيُّهَآ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ ءَامِنُواْ بِمَا نَزَّلْنَا مُصَدِّقاً لِّمَا مَعَكُمْ مِّن قَبْلِ أَن نَّطْمِسَ وُجُوهاً فَنَرُدَّهَا عَلَىٰ أَدْبَارِهَآ أَوْ نَلْعَنَهُمْ كَمَا لَعَنَّآ أَصْحَٰبَ ٱلسَّبْتِ وَكَانَ أَمْرُ ٱللَّهِ مَفْعُولاً,O you who have been given the Scripture believe in what We have revealed of the Qur’ān confirming what is with you of the Torah before We obliterate faces erasing the eyes noses and eyebrows in them and turn them inside out and make them like the napes of the neck a flat plate or curse them by transforming them into apes as We cursed as We transformed those of the Sabbath among them and God’s command His decree is done after this was revealed ‘Abd Allāh b. Salām converted to Islam and so it was said that this had been a conditional threat of punishment so that when some of them converted to Islam it the threat was lifted. It is also said that obliteration and transformation will take place before the rising of the Hour.
إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لاَ يَغْفِرُ أَن يُشْرَكَ بِهِ وَيَغْفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذَلِكَ لِمَن يَشَآءُ وَمَن يُشْرِكْ بِٱللَّهِ فَقَدِ ٱفْتَرَىٰ إِثْماً عَظِيماً,God forgives not that anything should be associated with Him. But He forgives other than save that of sins to whomever He wills forgiveness for by admitting him into Paradise without punishment. And whomever He wills of the believers He punishes for their sins and then admits them into Paradise. Whoever associates anything with God then he has indeed invented a tremendous a great sin.
أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى ٱلَّذِينَ يُزَكُّونَ أَنْفُسَهُمْ بَلِ ٱللَّهُ يُزَكِّي مَن يَشَآءُ وَلاَ يُظْلَمُونَ فَتِيلاً,Have you not seen those who praise themselves for purity? namely the Jews when they say ‘We are God’s children and His beloved’ in other words it is not a matter of their purifying themselves. Nay God purifies whom He will through faith and they shall not be wronged they shall not be diminished of their deeds a single date-thread as much as the peel on a date-stone.
ٱنظُرْ كَيفَ يَفْتَرُونَ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ ٱلكَذِبَ وَكَفَىٰ بِهِ إِثْماً مُّبِيناً,Consider in amazement how they invent falsehood against God in that way and that suffices for a clear an evident sin.
أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ نَصِيباً مِّنَ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱلْجِبْتِ وَٱلطَّٰغُوتِ وَيَقُولُونَ لِلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ هَٰؤُلاءِ أَهْدَىٰ مِنَ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ سَبِيلاً,The following was revealed regarding Ka‘b b. al-Ashraf and other such scholars from among the Jews when they came to Mecca and saw those killed at Badr and began to incite the idolaters to avenge them their dead by waging war against the Prophet s Have you not seen those who were given a share of the Book how they believe in al-Jibt and al-Tāghūt two idols belonging to Quraysh and say to the disbelievers to Abū Sufyān and his companions when they the latter said to them ‘Are we who are the guardians of the House who give drink to the pilgrim offer hospitality to the guest set free the captive and do such and such … not more rightly guided than Muhammad he who has contravened the religion of his forefathers severed the ties of kinship and abandoned the Sanctuary?’ ‘These in other words you are more rightly guided upon a more upright way than the believers’?
أُوْلَـٰئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ لَعَنَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ وَمَن يَلْعَنِ ٱللَّهُ فَلَن تَجِدَ لَهُ نَصِيراً,Those are the ones whom God has cursed; and he whom God has cursed you will never find for him any helper anyone to protect him from His chastisement.
أَمْ لَهُمْ نَصِيبٌ مِّنَ ٱلْمُلْكِ فَإِذاً لاَّ يُؤْتُونَ ٱلنَّاسَ نَقِيراً,Or have they a share in the Kingdom? that is to say they have no share in it whatever and even if they did then they would not give the people a single date-spot that is not even something as worthless as the tiny spot on the back of a date-pit because of the extent of their niggardliness.
أَمْ يَحْسُدُونَ ٱلنَّاسَ عَلَىٰ مَآ آتَٰهُمُ ٱللَّهُ مِن فَضْلِهِ فَقَدْ آتَيْنَآ آلَ إِبْرَٰهِيمَ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ وَٱلْحِكْمَةَ وَآتَيْنَاهُمْ مُّلْكاً عَظِيماً,Or nay are they jealous of people namely of the Prophet s for the bounty that God has bestowed upon them in the way of prophethood and abundance of women? In other words they wish that he be deprived of such things saying ‘If he were truly a prophet he would not be concerned with women’. For We gave the House of Abraham his forefather the likes of Moses David and Solomon the Book and wisdom and prophethood and We gave them a mighty kingdom David had ninety–nine women and Solomon had a thousand free women and slavegirls.
فَمِنْهُمْ مَّنْ آمَنَ بِهِ وَمِنْهُمْ مَّن صَدَّ عَنْهُ وَكَفَىٰ بِجَهَنَّمَ سَعِيراً,And there are some of them who believe in him in Muhammad (s) and some of them who bar from him who reject him and do not believe. Hell suffices for a blaze as a chastisement for those who do not believe.
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ بِآيَٰتِنَا سَوْفَ نُصْلِيهِمْ نَاراً كُلَّمَا نَضِجَتْ جُلُودُهُمْ بَدَّلْنَٰهُمْ جُلُوداً غَيْرَهَا لِيَذُوقُواْ ٱلْعَذَابَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ عَزِيزاً حَكِيماً,Surely those who disbelieve in Our signs — We shall expose them We shall admit them to a Fire wherein they shall burn; as often as their skins are consumed burnt We shall replace them with other skins restoring them to their initial unburnt state that they may taste the chastisement that they may suffer its severity. Surely God is ever Mighty nothing being beyond His power Wise in His creation.
وَٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ سَنُدْخِلُهُمْ جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلأَنْهَارُ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَآ أَبَداً لَّهُمْ فِيهَآ أَزْوَاجٌ مُّطَهَّرَةٌ وَنُدْخِلُهُمْ ظِـلاًّ ظَلِيلاً,And those that believe and perform righteous deeds We shall admit them to Gardens underneath which rivers flow wherein they abide they shall have therein spouses purified of menstruation and every impurity and We shall admit them to plenteous shade that is everlasting shade never replaced by any sun and this is the shade of Paradise.
إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَأْمُرُكُمْ أَن تُؤدُّواْ ٱلأَمَانَاتِ إِلَىۤ أَهْلِهَا وَإِذَا حَكَمْتُمْ بَيْنَ ٱلنَّاسِ أَن تَحْكُمُواْ بِٱلْعَدْلِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ نِعِمَّا يَعِظُكُمْ بِهِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ سَمِيعاً بَصِيراً,Verily God commands you to restore trusts that is the rights entrusted to you by others back to their owners this was revealed when ‘Alī may God be pleased with him took the key of the Ka‘ba from its keeper ‘Uthmān b. Talha al-Hajabī by force upon the arrival of the Prophet s in Mecca in the year of the Conquest after he ‘Uthmān had tried to prevent him ‘Alī from taking it saying ‘If I had known that he was the Messenger of God I would not have prevented him’. The Messenger of God s then ordered him ‘Alī to give it back to him ‘Uthmān saying to him ‘Here you are it is yours now and always’. He ‘Uthmān was amazed by this whereupon ‘Alī recited to him this verse and he accepted Islam. Upon his death he ‘Uthmān gave it the key to his brother Shayba and thus it remained in the keep of his descendants. Although the verse was revealed regarding a specific occasion it holds true in general on account of the plural person to which it is addressed. And when you judge between people He commands that you judge with justice. Excellent is ni‘immā the mīm of ni‘ima has been assimilated with the indefinite particle mā which is the object described in other words na‘ima shay’an ‘an excellent thing is’ the admonition God gives you to restore a trust and to judge with justice. God is ever Hearer of what is said Seer of what is done.
يَا أَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ أَطِيعُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَأَطِيعُواْ ٱلرَّسُولَ وَأُوْلِي ٱلأَمْرِ مِنْكُمْ فَإِن تَنَازَعْتُمْ فِي شَيْءٍ فَرُدُّوهُ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ وَٱلرَّسُولِ إِن كُنْتُمْ تُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلآخِرِ ذٰلِكَ خَيْرٌ وَأَحْسَنُ تَأْوِيلاً,O you who believe obey God and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you that is rulers when they command you to obey God and His Messenger. If you should quarrel disagree about anything refer it to God that is to His Book and the Messenger while he lives and thereafter refer to his Sunna in other words examine these disputes with reference to these two sources if you believe in God and the Last Day; that reference to the two sources is better for you than quarrelling or adhering to personal opinions and more excellent in interpretation in the end.
أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى ٱلَّذِينَ يَزْعُمُونَ أَنَّهُمْ ءَامَنُواْ بِمَآ أُنْزِلَ إِلَيْكَ وَمَآ أُنزِلَ مِن قَبْلِكَ يُرِيدُونَ أَن يَتَحَاكَمُوۤاْ إِلَى ٱلطَّاغُوتِ وَقَدْ أُمِرُوۤاْ أَن يَكْفُرُواْ بِهِ وَيُرِيدُ ٱلشَّيْطَانُ أَن يُضِلَّهُمْ ضَلاَلاً بَعِيداً,The following verse was revealed when a Jew and a hypocrite fell into a dispute. The hypocrite called on Ka‘b b. al-Ashraf to arbitrate between them while the Jew called on the Prophet s. When they came to him the Prophet ruled in favour of the Jew. But the hypocrite was not satisfied and so they went before ‘Umar. The Jew told him what had happened whereupon he ‘Umar turned to the hypocrite and asked him ‘Is this true?’ and when he replied ‘Yes’ he ‘Umar killed him. Have you not seen those who claim that they believe in what has been revealed to you and what was revealed before you desiring to take their disputes to a false deity tāghūt one excessive in tempting others to falsehood tughyān namely Ka‘b b. al-Ashraf when they have been commanded to renounce him? and not to associate with him. But Satan desires to mislead them far astray from the truth.
وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمْ تَعَالَوْاْ إِلَىٰ مَآ أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ وَإِلَى ٱلرَّسُولِ رَأَيْتَ ٱلْمُنَٰفِقِينَ يَصُدُّونَ عَنكَ صُدُوداً,And when it is said to them ‘Come to what God has revealed as regards rulings in the Qur’ān and the Messenger’ that he may judge between you you see the hypocrites turn away from you vehemently to others.
فَكَيْفَ إِذَآ أَصَٰبَتْهُمْ مُّصِيبَةٌ بِمَا قَدَّمَتْ أَيْدِيهِمْ ثُمَّ جَآءُوكَ يَحْلِفُونَ بِٱللَّهِ إِنْ أَرَدْنَآ إِلاَّ إِحْسَٰناً وَتَوْفِيقاً,How would it be what would they do when an affliction a punishment befalls them for what their own hands have sent before them of unbelief and acts of disobedience that is to say would they then be able to turn away and escape it? No! They then come to you thumma jā’ūka a supplement to yasuddūn ‘they turn away’ of the previous verse swearing by God that in turning to other than you for arbitration ‘We sought only virtue settlement and harmony’ reconciliation between the disputing parties by any approximate judgement without regard for the painful truth.
أُولَـٰئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ يَعْلَمُ ٱللَّهُ مَا فِي قُلُوبِهِمْ فَأَعْرِضْ عَنْهُمْ وَعِظْهُمْ وَقُل لَّهُمْ فِيۤ أَنْفُسِهِمْ قَوْلاً بَلِيغاً,Those — God knows what is in their hearts in the way of hypocrisy and the mendacity of their excuses; so turn away from them with forgiveness and admonish them make them fear God and say to them regarding the issue of their souls penetrating words affecting them in other words reprimand them so that they repent of their unbelief.
وَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن رَّسُولٍ إِلاَّ لِيُطَاعَ بِإِذْنِ ٱللَّهِ وَلَوْ أَنَّهُمْ إِذ ظَّلَمُوۤاْ أَنْفُسَهُمْ جَآءُوكَ فَٱسْتَغْفَرُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَٱسْتَغْفَرَ لَهُمُ ٱلرَّسُولُ لَوَجَدُواْ ٱللَّهَ تَوَّاباً رَّحِيماً,We never sent any Messenger but that he should be obeyed in what he commands and judges by the leave by the command of God and not that he should be disobeyed or opposed. If when they had wronged themselves by seeking the judgement of the false idol they had come to you repentant and asked forgiveness from God and the Messenger had asked forgiveness for them there is a shift from the second to the third person in this address in deference to his the Prophet’s s status; they would have found God Relenting to them Merciful to them.
فَلاَ وَرَبِّكَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ حَتَّىٰ يُحَكِّمُوكَ فِيمَا شَجَرَ بَيْنَهُمْ ثُمَّ لاَ يَجِدُواْ فِيۤ أَنْفُسِهِمْ حَرَجاً مِّمَّا قَضَيْتَ وَيُسَلِّمُواْ تَسْلِيماً,But no fa-lā the lā is extra by your Lord! They will not believe until they make you judge over what has broken out has become mixed up between them and find in themselves no inhibition no constraint or doubt regarding what you decide but submit but comply with your ruling in full submission without objection.
وَلَوْ أَنَّا كَتَبْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ أَنِ ٱقْتُلُوۤاْ أَنْفُسَكُمْ أَوِ ٱخْرُجُواْ مِن دِيَارِكُمْ مَّا فَعَلُوهُ إِلاَّ قَلِيلٌ مِّنْهُمْ وَلَوْ أَنَّهُمْ فَعَلُواْ مَا يُوعَظُونَ بِهِ لَكَانَ خَيْراً لَّهُمْ وَأَشَدَّ تَثْبِيتاً,And had We prescribed for them the particle an ‘that’ is explicative ‘Slay yourselves’ or ‘Leave your habitations’ as We did for the Children of Israel they would not have done it that is what has been prescribed for them save a few read nominative qalīlun as a substitution; or read accusative qalīlan as an exceptive clause of them; yet if they had done what they were admonished to do of obedience to the Messenger s it would have been better for them and stronger in establishing a stronger confirmation of their faith.
وَإِذاً لأَتَيْنَٰهُم مِّن لَّدُنَّـآ أَجْراً عَظِيماً,And then that is had they confirmed themselves We would have surely given them from Us a great wage that is Paradise.
وَلَهَدَيْنَاهُمْ صِرَاطاً مُّسْتَقِيماً,And We would have guided them to a straight path. Some Companions said to the Prophet s ‘How will we be able to see you in Paradise when you will be in the highest stations and we will be lower than you?’ and so the following was revealed
وَمَن يُطِعِ ٱللَّهَ وَٱلرَّسُولَ فَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ مَعَ ٱلَّذِينَ أَنْعَمَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْهِم مِّنَ ٱلنَّبِيِّينَ وَٱلصِّدِّيقِينَ وَٱلشُّهَدَآءِ وَٱلصَّالِحِينَ وَحَسُنَ أُولَـٰئِكَ رَفِيقاً,Whoever obeys God and the Messenger in what he commands they are with those whom God has blessed of the prophets and the truthful that is the most excellent of the Prophet’s Companions because of the fullness of their truthfulness and their affirmation of the truth; and the martyrs those slain in the path of God; and the righteous all those other than the ones mentioned. What fine companions they are! in Paradise since in it one will enjoy seeing them visiting them and being in their presence even though they will be in the highest stations in relation to others.
ذٰلِكَ ٱلْفَضْلُ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ وَكَفَىٰ بِٱللَّهِ عَلِيماً,That namely their being with those mentioned dhālika ‘that’ is the subject the predicate of which is the following is bounty from God with which He has favoured them and not because they have earned it through their obedience. God suffices as Knower of the reward of the Hereafter in other words trust in what He has told you None can tell you like One Who is aware Q. 3514.
يَٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءامَنُواْ خُذُواْ حِذْرَكُمْ فَٱنفِرُواْ ثُبَاتٍ أَوِ ٱنْفِرُواْ جَمِيعاً,O you who believe take your precautions against your enemy that is be wary of him and be vigilant against him; then move forward prepare to fight him in companies in separate groups one raiding party followed by the next; or move forward all together in one assembly.
وَإِنَّ مِنْكُمْ لَمَن لَّيُبَطِّئَنَّ فَإِنْ أَصَٰبَتْكُمْ مُّصِيبَةٌ قَالَ قَدْ أَنْعَمَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيَّ إِذْ لَمْ أَكُنْ مَّعَهُمْ شَهِيداً,Verily there are some of you who tarry who indeed hesitate to join the fighting such as ‘Abd Allāh b. Ubayy the hypocrite and his companions — counting him the one who tarries as one of them the Muslims is from the perspective of outward appearances — the lām in the verb la-yubatti’anna ‘verily … who tarry’ is for oaths; then if an affliction befalls you such as slaughter or defeat he says ‘God has been gracious to me for I was not a witness with them’ present at the fighting lest I should be hurt.
وَلَئِنْ أَصَٰبَكُمْ فَضْلٌ مِنَ الله لَيَقُولَنَّ كَأَن لَّمْ تَكُنْ بَيْنَكُمْ وَبَيْنَهُ مَوَدَّةٌ يٰلَيتَنِي كُنتُ مَعَهُمْ فَأَفُوزَ فَوْزاً عَظِيماً,But if wa-la-in the lām is for oaths a bounty from God befalls you such as a conquest or booty he will surely cry in regret as if ka’an is softened its subject having been omitted in other words it should be ka’annahu there had never been read lam yakun or lam takun any affection any acquaintance or friendship between you and him this statement refers back to the words in the previous verse ‘God has been gracious to me’ and comes as a parenthesis between the statement ‘that he will cry’ and the very words he cries which are ‘Oh yā is for exclamation would that I had been with them so that I might have won a great triumph!’ that is that I might have taken a good share of the booty.
فَلْيُقَاتِلْ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلَّذِينَ يَشْرُونَ ٱلْحَيَاةَ ٱلدُّنْيَا بِٱلآخِرَةِ وَمَن يُقَاتِلْ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ فَيُقْتَلْ أَو يَغْلِبْ فَسَوْفَ نُؤْتِيهِ أَجْراً عَظِيماً,God exalted be He says So let them fight in the way of God to elevate His religion those who sell the life of this world for the Hereafter; and whoever fights in the way of God and is slain dies a martyr or conquers overcomes his enemy We shall give him a great wage a plentiful reward.
وَمَا لَكُمْ لاَ تُقَٰتِلُونَ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ وَٱلْمُسْتَضْعَفِينَ مِنَ ٱلرِّجَالِ وَٱلنِّسَآءِ وَٱلْوِلْدَٰنِ ٱلَّذِينَ يَقُولُونَ رَبَّنَآ أَخْرِجْنَا مِنْ هَـٰذِهِ ٱلْقَرْيَةِ ٱلظَّالِمِ أَهْلُهَا وَٱجْعَلْ لَّنَا مِن لَّدُنْكَ وَلِيّاً وَٱجْعَلْ لَّنَا مِن لَّدُنْكَ نَصِيراً,What is wrong with you that you do not fight this is an interrogative of rebuke in other words there is nothing to prevent you from fighting in the way of God and for the deliverance of the oppressed men women and children whom the disbelievers persecuted and prevented from emigrating. Ibn ‘Abbās may God be pleased with him and his father said ‘My mother and I were among them’; who say supplicating ‘O our Lord bring us forth from this town Mecca whose people are evildoers through unbelief and appoint for us a protector from You to take charge of our affair and appoint for us from You a helper’ to defend us against them. God responded to their supplication and facilitated escape for some of them while others remained behind until Mecca was conquered — in charge of them the Prophet s placed ‘Attāb b. Asīd who proceeded to seek justice for the wronged from those that had wronged them.
ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ يُقَٰتِلُونَ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ وَٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ يُقَٰتِلُونَ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱلطَّٰغُوتِ فَقَٰتِلُوۤاْ أَوْلِيَاءَ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنِ إِنَّ كَيْدَ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنِ كَانَ ضَعِيفاً,Those who believe fight in the way of God and those who disbelieve fight in the way of a false deity Satan. Fight therefore against the friends of Satan the supporters of his religion and you will defeat them with the strength you draw from God; surely the plotting of Satan against believers is ever feeble of no substance and cannot stand up to God’s plotting against the disbelievers.
أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى ٱلَّذِينَ قِيلَ لَهُمْ كُفُّوۤاْ أَيْدِيَكُمْ وَأَقِيمُواْ ٱلصَّلَٰوةَ وَآتُواْ ٱلزَّكَٰوةَ فَلَمَّا كُتِبَ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلْقِتَالُ إِذَا فَرِيقٌ مِّنْهُمْ يَخْشَوْنَ ٱلنَّاسَ كَخَشْيَةِ ٱللَّهِ أَوْ أَشَدَّ خَشْيَةً وَقَالُواْ رَبَّنَا لِمَ كَتَبْتَ عَلَيْنَا ٱلْقِتَالَ لَوْلاۤ أَخَّرْتَنَا إِلَىٰ أَجَلٍ قَرِيبٍ قُلْ مَتَاعُ ٱلدُّنْيَا قَلِيلٌ وَٱلآخِرَةُ خَيْرٌ لِّمَنِ ٱتَّقَىٰ وَلاَ تُظْلَمُونَ فَتِيلاً,Have you not seen those to whom it was said ‘Restrain your hands from fighting the disbelievers when they desired it at Mecca because of the harm the disbelievers had inflicted upon them — and these were a group from among the Companions — and establish the prayer and pay the alms’? Then as soon as fighting was prescribed was made obligatory for them lo a party of them fear people the disbelievers that is they fear punishment at their hands through death as they would fear the punishment of God or with more fear than their fear of Him ashadda ‘more’ is in the accusative because it is a circumstantial qualifier; the response to the lammā ‘as soon as’ is indicated by idhā ‘lo’ and what follows in other words they are taken aback by fear and they said frightened of death ‘Our Lord why have You prescribed fighting for us? Why not lawlā is to be understood as hallā defer us to a near term?’ Say to them ‘The enjoyment of this world that which is enjoyed therein or enjoying it the world is trifling it will end up by perishing; and the Hereafter Paradise is better for him who fears God’s punishment by avoiding disobedience to Him; and you shall not be wronged lā tuzlamūna may also be read lā yuzlamūna ‘they shall not be wronged’ you shall not be diminished of your deeds a single date-thread as much as the peel on a date-stone so struggle in the way of God.
أَيْنَمَا تَكُونُواْ يُدْرِككُّمُ ٱلْمَوْتُ وَلَوْ كُنتُمْ فِي بُرُوجٍ مُّشَيَّدَةٍ وَإِن تُصِبْهُمْ حَسَنَةٌ يَقُولُواْ هَـٰذِهِ مِنْ عِندِ ٱللَّهِ وَإِن تُصِبْهُمْ سَيِّئَةٌ يَقُولُواْ هَـٰذِهِ مِنْ عِندِكَ قُلْ كُلٌّ مِّنْ عِندِ ٱللَّهِ فَمَالِ هَـٰؤُلاۤءِ ٱلْقَوْمِ لاَ يَكَادُونَ يَفْقَهُونَ حَدِيثاً,Wherever you may be death will overtake you though you should be in raised-up lofty towers’ forts so do not shrink from fighting for fear of death. And if a good thing such as fertility and abundance befalls them the Jews they say ‘This is from God’; but if an evil thing such as drought or misfortune befalls them as it did with them when the Prophet s arrived in Medina they say ‘This is from you’ O Muhammad (s) that is from the bad luck you bring. Say to them ‘Everything good and evil is from God.’ What is wrong with this people that they do not understand that is they do not come close to comprehending any words delivered to them the mā ‘what’ of mā li-hā’ūlā’ ‘what is wrong with these’ is an interrogative intended to provoke amazement at their extreme ignorance; to state that one cannot even come close to doing something is rhetorically more intense than saying that he cannot do it.
مَّآ أَصَابَكَ مِنْ حَسَنَةٍ فَمِنَ ٱللَّهِ وَمَآ أَصَابَكَ مِن سَيِّئَةٍ فَمِن نَّفْسِكَ وَأَرْسَلْنَاكَ لِلنَّاسِ رَسُولاً وَكَفَىٰ بِٱللَّهِ شَهِيداً,Whatever good hasana means khayr befalls you O man it is from God it has come to you from His bounty; whatever evil misfortune befalls you is from yourself it has come to you as a necessary consequence of sins you have committed. We have sent you O Muhammad (s) to people as a messenger rasūlan is a circumstantial qualifier for emphasis and God suffices as Witness of your Mission.
مَّنْ يُطِعِ ٱلرَّسُولَ فَقَدْ أَطَاعَ ٱللَّهَ وَمَن تَوَلَّىٰ فَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَاكَ عَلَيْهِمْ حَفِيظاً,Whoever obeys the Messenger verily obeys God; and whoever turns his back whoever avoids obedience to you do not be concerned with them We have not sent you as a watcher over them to keep watch over their deeds but as a warner. Their affair is Ours to deal with and We will requite them. This statement was before the command to fight them was revealed.
وَيَقُولُونَ طَاعَةٌ فَإِذَا بَرَزُواْ مِنْ عِندِكَ بَيَّتَ طَآئِفَةٌ مِّنْهُمْ غَيْرَ ٱلَّذِي تَقُولُ وَٱللَّهُ يَكْتُبُ مَا يُبَيِّتُونَ فَأَعْرِضْ عَنْهُمْ وَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ وَكَفَىٰ بِٱللَّهِ وَكِيلاً,They say that is the hypocrites say when they come to you ‘Our affair is all about Obedience to you’; but when they sally forth when they depart from you a party of them harbour the final tā’ of the feminine-ending in bayyatat ‘harbour’ can either be elided with the following tā’ of tā’ifa ‘a party’ or simply omitted they entertain secretly feelings other than what they say to you in your presence in the way of their obedience in other words they hide disobedience to you. God writes down He commands that it be written what they harbour in their scrolls of deeds so that they will be requited for it. So turn away from them in forgiveness rely on God put your trust in Him for He will suffice you; and God suffices as a Guardian to Whom matters are entrusted.
أَفَلاَ يَتَدَبَّرُونَ ٱلْقُرْآنَ وَلَوْ كَانَ مِنْ عِندِ غَيْرِ ٱللَّهِ لَوَجَدُواْ فِيهِ ٱخْتِلاَفاً كَثِيراً,What do they not ponder do they not contemplate the Qur’ān? and the marvellous truths contained in it. If it had been from other than God surely they would have found therein much inconsistency much contradiction in meaning and irregularity in arrangement.
وَإِذَا جَآءَهُمْ أَمْرٌ مِّنَ ٱلأَمْنِ أَوِ ٱلْخَوْفِ أَذَاعُواْ بِهِ وَلَوْ رَدُّوهُ إِلَى ٱلرَّسُولِ وَإِلَىٰ أُوْلِي ٱلأَمْرِ مِنْهُمْ لَعَلِمَهُ ٱلَّذِينَ يَسْتَنْبِطُونَهُ مِنْهُمْ وَلَوْلاَ فَضْلُ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ وَرَحْمَتُهُ لاَتَّبَعْتُمُ ٱلشَّيْطَانَ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً,And when there comes to them an issue news concerning the raiding parties sent by the Prophet s and what has happened to them be it of security through victory or of fear through defeat they broadcast it they make it widely-known this was revealed regarding a group from among the hypocrites or from among the feeble believers who used to do this and so the hearts of the believers would lose courage and the Prophet s would become distressed. If they had referred it the news to the Messenger and to those in authority among them that is the judicious elders among the Companions in other words if they had kept quiet about it until they were fully informed; those among them who are able to think it out those who follow it up and seek knowledge of it the ones who broadcast it would have known it and whether it is a matter that ought be broadcast or not from them from the Prophet s and those of authority. And but for the bounty of God to you through Islam and His mercy to you through the Qur’ān you would surely have followed Satan in the abominations to which he commands you except a few of you.
فَقَاتِلْ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ لاَ تُكَلَّفُ إِلاَّ نَفْسَكَ وَحَرِّضِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ عَسَى ٱللَّهُ أَن يَكُفَّ بَأْسَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَٱللَّهُ أَشَدُّ بَأْساً وَأَشَدُّ تَنكِيلاً,So fight O Muhammad (s) in the way of God; you are charged only with yourself so do not be concerned with their failing to join you the meaning being fight even if you are on your own for you have been promised victory. And urge on the believers incite them to fight and make them desire it; maybe God will restrain the might the war of the disbelievers; God is mightier than them and more severe in castigation in punishment than them. And so the Messenger of God s said ‘By Him in Whose Hand is my soul I shall sally forth to fight even if I go alone’. Thereupon he sallied forth with seventy cavalrymen to the first battle at Badr where God restrained the might of the disbelievers by casting terror into their hearts and preventing Abū Sufyān from sallying forth as has already been mentioned in sūrat Āl ‘Imrān Q. 3151.
مَّن يَشْفَعْ شَفَٰعَةً حَسَنَةً يَكُنْ لَّهُ نَصِيبٌ مِّنْهَا وَمَن يَشْفَعْ شَفَٰعَةً سَيِّئَةً يَكُنْ لَّهُ كِفْلٌ مِّنْهَا وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ مُّقِيتاً,Whoever intercedes between people with a good intercession one in accordance with the Law shall receive a share of the reward for it because of it; and whoever intercedes with an evil intercession one in contravention of it the Law shall receive the like the share of the sin from it because of it. God conserves He has power over all things and so requites every person according to his deeds.
وَإِذَا حُيِّيتُم بِتَحِيَّةٍ فَحَيُّواْ بِأَحْسَنَ مِنْهَآ أَوْ رُدُّوهَآ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ حَسِيباً,And when you are greeted with a greeting as when it is said to you ‘Peace be upon you’ greet the one that greeted you with better than it by responding to him with ‘Peace be upon you and God’s mercy and blessings’ or return it by saying back to him what he said; in other words it is a duty to greet in one of these two ways the former being the preferred one. Surely God keeps count of He holds you accountable for all things and requites accordingly including things such as returning a greeting. The Sunna specifies that one should not return the greeting of an disbeliever an innovator a wicked person and of the one that greets a person who is in the act of relieving himself or one in the bath or one eating — indeed it is actually disapproved with the exception of the last. To the disbeliever who says ‘peace be upon you’ one should simply say ‘And upon you’.
ٱللَّهُ لاۤ إِلَـٰهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ لَيَجْمَعَنَّكُمْ إِلَىٰ يَوْمِ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ لاَ رَيْبَ فِيهِ وَمَنْ أَصْدَقُ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ حَدِيثاً,God — there is no god except Him and by God He will surely gather you from your graves to on the Day of Resurrection whereof there is no doubt no uncertainty. And who is truer in statement in speech than God? that is no one is.
فَمَا لَكُمْ فِي ٱلْمُنَافِقِينَ فِئَتَيْنِ وَٱللَّهُ أَرْكَسَهُمْ بِمَا كَسَبُوۤاْ أَتُرِيدُونَ أَن تَهْدُواْ مَنْ أَضَلَّ ٱللَّهُ وَمَن يُضْلِلِ ٱللَّهُ فَلَن تَجِدَ لَهُ سَبِيلاً,When a group retreated from Uhud people were at variance over their status. Some said ‘Let us slay them’ while others said ‘No!’ So the following was revealed What is wrong with you what is the matter with you that you have become two parties two groups regarding the hypocrites when God has overthrown them He has turned them back to disbelief for what they earned? in the way of disbelief and acts of disobedience. What do you desire to guide him whom God has sent astray? that is to count them among the guided the interrogative in both places is for disapproval. And he whom God sends astray you will never find for him a way a path to guidance.
وَدُّواْ لَوْ تَكْفُرُونَ كَمَا كَفَرُواْ فَتَكُونُونَ سَوَآءً فَلاَ تَتَّخِذُواْ مِنْهُمْ أَوْلِيَآءَ حَتَّىٰ يُهَاجِرُواْ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ فَإِنْ تَوَلَّوْاْ فَخُذُوهُمْ وَٱقْتُلُوهُمْ حَيْثُ وَجَدتُّمُوهُمْ وَلاَ تَتَّخِذُواْ مِنْهُمْ وَلِيّاً وَلاَ نَصِيراً,They long they wish that you should disbelieve as they disbelieve so then you and they would be equal in unbelief; therefore do not take friends from among them associating with them even if they should outwardly manifest belief until they emigrate in the way of God a proper emigration that would confirm their belief; then if they turn away and remain upon their ways take them as captives and slay them wherever you find them; and do not take any of them as a patron to associate with or as a helper to assist you against your enemy.
إِلاَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يَصِلُونَ إِلَىٰ قَوْمٍ بَيْنَكُمْ وَبَيْنَهُمْ مِّيثَٰقٌ أَوْ جَآءُوكُمْ حَصِرَتْ صُدُورُهُمْ أَن يُقَٰتِلُوكُمْ أَوْ يُقَٰتِلُواْ قَوْمَهُمْ وَلَوْ شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ لَسَلَّطَهُمْ عَلَيْكُمْ فَلَقَٰتَلُوكُمْ فَإِنِ ٱعْتَزَلُوكُمْ فَلَمْ يُقَٰتِلُوكُمْ وَأَلْقَوْاْ إِلَيْكُمُ ٱلسَّلَمَ فَمَا جَعَلَ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمْ عَلَيْهِمْ سَبِيلاً,Except those who attach themselves to who seek refuge with a people between whom and you there is a covenant a pledge of security for them and for whoever attaches himself to them in the manner of the Prophet’s s covenant with Hilāl b. ‘Uwaymir al-Aslamī; or those who come to you with their breasts constricted dejected about the prospect of fighting you being on the side of their people or fighting their people siding with you in other words those who come to you refraining from fighting either you or them then do not interfere with them neither taking them as captives nor slaying them this statement and what follows was abrogated by the ‘sword’ verse. Had God willed to give them sway over you He would have given them sway over you by strengthening their hearts so that assuredly they would have fought you but God did not will it and so He cast terror into their hearts. And so if they stay away from you and do not fight you and offer you peace reconciliation that is if they submit then God does not allow you any way against them He does not allow you a means to take them captive or to slay them.
سَتَجِدُونَ آخَرِينَ يُرِيدُونَ أَن يَأْمَنُوكُمْ وَيَأْمَنُواْ قَوْمَهُمْ كُلَّ مَا رُدُّوۤاْ إِلَى ٱلْفِتْنِةِ أُرْكِسُواْ فِيِهَا فَإِن لَّمْ يَعْتَزِلُوكُمْ وَيُلْقُوۤاْ إِلَيْكُمُ ٱلسَّلَمَ وَيَكُفُّوۤاْ أَيْدِيَهُمْ فَخُذُوهُمْ وَٱقْتُلُوهُمْ حَيْثُ ثَقِفْتُمُوهُمْ وَأُوْلَـٰئِكُمْ جَعَلْنَا لَكُمْ عَلَيْهِمْ سُلْطَاناً مُّبِيناً,You will find others desiring to have security from you by manifesting belief before you and security from their own people through unbelief when they return to them and these were the tribes of Asad and Ghatafān; yet whenever they are returned to sedition whenever they are summoned to idolatry they are overwhelmed by it falling into it in the worst of ways. So if they do not stay away from you by refraining from fighting you and do not offer you peace and do not restrain their hands from you then take them as captives and slay them wherever you come upon them wherever you find them; against them We have given you clear warrant a clear and manifest proof for you to slay them and capture them on account of their treachery.
وَمَا كَانَ لِمُؤْمِنٍ أَن يَقْتُلَ مُؤْمِناً إِلاَّ خَطَئاً وَمَن قَتَلَ مُؤْمِناً خَطَئاً فَتَحْرِيرُ رَقَبَةٍ مُّؤْمِنَةٍ وَدِيَةٌ مُّسَلَّمَةٌ إِلَىٰ أَهْلِهِ إِلاَّ أَن يَصَّدَّقُواْ فَإِن كَانَ مِن قَوْمٍ عَدُوٍّ لَّكُمْ وَهُوَ مُؤْمِنٌ فَتَحْرِيرُ رَقَبَةٍ مُّؤْمِنَةٍ وَإِن كَانَ مِن قَوْمٍ بَيْنَكُمْ وَبَيْنَهُمْ مِّيثَٰقٌ فَدِيَةٌ مُّسَلَّمَةٌ إِلَىۤ أَهْلِهِ وَتَحْرِيرُ رَقَبَةٍ مُّؤْمِنَةٍ فَمَن لَّمْ يَجِدْ فَصِيَامُ شَهْرَيْنِ مُتَتَابِعَيْنِ تَوْبَةً مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ عَلِيماً حَكِيماً,It is not for a believer to slay a believer in other words no such slaying should result at his hands except by mistake killing him by mistake unintentionally. He who slays a believer by mistake when he meant to strike some other thing as in the case of hunting or shooting at trees but then happens to strike him with what in most cases would not kill then let him set free let him emancipate a believing slave raqaba denotes nasama ‘a person’ an obligation on him and blood-money is to be submitted to be paid to his family that is the slain person’s inheritors unless they remit it as a charity to him by waiving their claim to it. In the Sunna this blood-money is explained as being equivalent to one hundred camels twenty pregnant twenty female sucklings twenty male sucklings twenty mature ones and twenty young ones not more than five years old; and the Sunna stipulates that it is incumbent upon the killer’s clan namely his paternal relations and not other relatives. They share this burden of the blood-money over three years; the rich among them pays half a dinar while the one of moderate means pays a quarter of a dinar each year; if they still cannot meet this then it can be taken from the treasury and if this is not possible then from the killer himself. If he the slain belongs to a people at enmity at war with you and is a believer then the setting free of a believing slave is incumbent upon the slayer as a redemption but no bloodmoney is to be paid to his family since they are at war with you. If he the slain belongs to a people between whom and you there is a covenant a treaty as is the case with the Protected People ahl al-dhimma then the blood-money for him must be paid to his family and it constitutes a third of the blood-money for a believer if the slain be a Jew or a Christian and two thirds of a tenth of it if he be a Magian; and the setting free of a believing slave is incumbent upon the slayer. But if he has not the wherewithal for setting free a slave failing to find one or the means to obtain one then the fasting of two successive months is incumbent upon him as a redemption here God does not mention the transition to an alternative to fasting which is giving food to the needy as in the case of repudiating one’s wife by zihār something which al-Shāfi‘ī advocates in the more correct of two opinions of his; a relenting from God tawbatan ‘relenting’ is the verbal noun and is in the accusative because of the implied verb.
وَمَن يَقْتُلْ مُؤْمِناً مُّتَعَمِّداً فَجَزَآؤُهُ جَهَنَّمُ خَٰلِداً فِيهَا وَغَضِبَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَلَعَنَهُ وَأَعَدَّ لَهُ عَذَاباً عَظِيماً,And whoever slays a believer deliberately intending to kill him with something that is lethal aware of the fact that he the slain is a believer his requital is Hell abiding therein and God is wroth with him and has cursed him He has removed him from His mercy and has prepared for him a mighty chastisement in the Fire this may be explained as referring to the person that deems such killing licit or as being his requital if he were to be requited but it would not be anything new if this threat of punishment were to be forgone because of what He says Other than that that is idolatry He forgives whomever He will Q. 448. It is reported from Ibn ‘Abbās that it the verse should be understood as it stands abrogating other verses of ‘forgiveness’. The verse in sūrat al-Baqara Q. 2178 clearly indicates that the one who kills deliberately should be killed in return or if he is pardoned then he has to pay the blood-money the value of which has already been mentioned. It is made clear in the Sunna that between the intentional and the unintentional there is a type of killing that is identified as being with quasi-deliberate intent shibh al-‘amd where the killer has slain with what in most cases is not a lethal implement. In such a case there is no right to retaliation and blood-money is paid instead so that it this type of killing is described as intentional but considered unintentional in that there applies the fixing of the period for payment and the sharing of the burden by the killer’s clan; in this case and that of intentional killing redemption is more urgent than in unintentional killing.
يَٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ إِذَا ضَرَبْتُمْ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ فَتَبَيَّنُواْ وَلاَ تَقُولُواْ لِمَنْ أَلْقَىۤ إِلَيْكُمُ ٱلسَّلاَمَ لَسْتَ مُؤْمِناً تَبْتَغُونَ عَرَضَ ٱلْحَيَٰوةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا فَعِنْدَ ٱللَّهِ مَغَانِمُ كَثِيرَةٌ كَذٰلِكَ كُنْتُمْ مِّن قَبْلُ فَمَنَّ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْكُمْ فَتَبَيَّنُواْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيراً,The following was revealed when a group from among the Companions passed by a man from the Banū Sulaym driving his flock of sheep and he offered them a greeting of peace. But they said ‘He only greeted us dissimulating out of fear’. So they killed him and took away his flock O you who believe when you are going forth travelling in order to struggle in the way of God be discriminating fa-tabayyanū; a variant reading has fa-tathabbatū ‘ascertain’ here and further below; and do not say to him who offers you peace read al-salām or al-salam that is the greeting or offers you submission declaring the profession of faith shahāda which is an indication of being a Muslim ‘You are not a believer you are only saying this to dissimulate for fear of your life and property’ so that you then end up killing him desiring seeking by this the transient goods of the life of this world that is its enjoyment in the way of spoils. With God are plenteous spoils rendering you free of the need to kill such a person for his property. So you were formerly when your lives and property were protected simply upon your professing the faith; but God has been gracious to you making you known for your faith and uprightness. So be discriminating lest you kill a believer and treat those entering the religion as you were treated formerly. Surely God is ever Aware of what you do and will requite you for it.
لاَّ يَسْتَوِي ٱلْقَٰعِدُونَ مِنَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ غَيْرُ أُوْلِي ٱلضَّرَرِ وَٱلْمُجَٰهِدُونَ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ بِأَمْوَٰلِهِمْ وَأَنْفُسِهِمْ فَضَّلَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْمُجَٰهِدِينَ بِأَمْوَٰلِهِمْ وَأَنْفُسِهِمْ عَلَى ٱلْقَٰعِدِينَ دَرَجَةً وَكُـلاًّ وَعَدَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْحُسْنَىٰ وَفَضَّلَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْمُجَٰهِدِينَ عَلَى ٱلْقَٰعِدِينَ أَجْراً عَظِيماً,The believers who sit at home away from the struggle other than those who have an injury such as a chronic illness or blindness or the like read in the nominative ghayru ūlī l-darar ‘other than those who have an injury’ as an adjectival clause; or in the accusative ghayra ūlī l-darar as an exceptive clause are not the equals of those who struggle in the way of God with their possessions and their lives. God has preferred those who struggle with their possessions and their lives over the ones who sit at home on account of some injury by a degree by a degree of merit since both have the same intention but the extra degree is given to those who have carried out the struggle; yet to each of the two groups God has promised the goodly reward Paradise and God has preferred those who struggle over the ones who sit at home without any injury with a great reward ajran ‘azīman is substituted by the following darajātin minhu
دَرَجَاتٍ مِّنْهُ وَمَغْفِرَةً وَرَحْمَةً وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ غَفُوراً رَّحِيماً,degrees that is stations one higher than the other in honour from Him and forgiveness and mercy maghfiratan and rahmatan are in the accusative because they constitute an object of the implied verb faddala ‘He has preferred’. Surely God is ever Forgiving to His friends Merciful to those that obey Him.
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ تَوَفَّاهُمُ ٱلْمَلاۤئِكَةُ ظَالِمِيۤ أَنْفُسِهِمْ قَالُواْ فِيمَ كُنتُمْ قَالُواْ كُنَّا مُسْتَضْعَفِينَ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ قَالْوۤاْ أَلَمْ تَكُنْ أَرْضُ ٱللَّهِ وَاسِعَةً فَتُهَاجِرُواْ فِيهَا فَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ مَأْوَاهُمْ جَهَنَّمُ وَسَآءَتْ مَصِيراً,The following was revealed regarding a group of people who submitted to Islam but did not emigrate and were then slain in the battle of Badr alongside the disbelievers And those whom the angels take in death while they are wronging their souls having remained among the disbelievers and neglected to emigrate the angels will say to them in rebuke ‘What was your predicament?’ in other words ‘in what circumstances were you with regard to your religion’. They will say giving excuses ‘We were oppressed unable to establish religion in the land’ the land of Mecca. The angels will say to them in rebuke ‘But was not God’s earth spacious that you might have emigrated therein?’ from the land of unbelief to another land as others did? God exalted be He says as for such their abode shall be Hell — an evil journey’s end it is!
إِلاَّ ٱلْمُسْتَضْعَفِينَ مِنَ ٱلرِّجَالِ وَٱلنِّسَآءِ وَٱلْوِلْدَانِ لاَ يَسْتَطِيعُونَ حِيلَةً وَلاَ يَهْتَدُونَ سَبِيلاً,Except the oppressed among the men women and children who are unable to devise a plan having no strength to emigrate and no substance and are not guided to a way a means of going to the land of emigration.
فَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ عَسَى ٱللَّهُ أَن يَعْفُوَ عَنْهُمْ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ عَفُوّاً غَفُوراً,As for such perhaps God will pardon them for God is ever Pardoning Forgiving.
وَمَن يُهَاجِرْ فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ يَجِدْ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ مُرَٰغَماً كَثِيراً وَسَعَةً وَمَن يَخْرُجْ مِن بَيْتِهِ مُهَاجِراً إِلَى ٱللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ ثُمَّ يُدْرِكْهُ ٱلْمَوْتُ فَقَدْ وَقَعَ أَجْرُهُ عَلىَ ٱللَّهِ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ غَفُوراً رَّحِيماً,Whoever emigrates in the way of God will find in the earth many refuges places of emigration and abundance of provision; whoever goes forth from his house as an emigrant to God and His Messenger and then death overtakes him along the way as occurred with Junda‘ or Jundab b. Damra al-Laythī his wage is then incumbent upon fixed with God; surely God is ever Forgiving Merciful.
وَإِذَا ضَرَبْتُمْ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ فَلَيْسَ عَلَيْكُمْ جُنَاحٌ أَن تَقْصُرُواْ مِنَ ٱلصَّلَٰوةِ إِنْ خِفْتُمْ أَن يَفْتِنَكُمُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوۤاْ إِنَّ ٱلْكَافِرِينَ كَانُواْ لَكُمْ عَدُوّاً مُّبِيناً,And when you are going forth travelling in the land you would not be at fault if you shorten the prayer by making it two genuflexions instead of four if you fear that you may be afflicted by those who do not believe that is if you fear that you may be harmed by them this fear of affliction at the hands of the disbelievers is just intended as an explication of the reality of the situation at that time and the point no longer applies. In the Sunna it is pointed out that ‘travel’ safar means long-distance travel which is approximately 50 miles. God’s words ‘you would not be at fault’ should be understood as denoting a dispensation and not a requirement and this is the opinion of al-Shāfi‘ī; the disbelievers are a manifest foe to you their enmity being evident.
وَإِذَا كُنتَ فِيهِمْ فَأَقَمْتَ لَهُمُ ٱلصَّلَٰوةَ فَلْتَقُمْ طَآئِفَةٌ مِّنْهُمْ مَّعَكَ وَلْيَأْخُذُوۤاْ أَسْلِحَتَهُمْ فَإِذَا سَجَدُواْ فَلْيَكُونُواْ مِن وَرَآئِكُمْ وَلْتَأْتِ طَآئِفَةٌ أُخْرَىٰ لَمْ يُصَلُّواْ فَلْيُصَلُّواْ مَعَكَ وَلْيَأْخُذُواْ حِذْرَهُمْ وَأَسْلِحَتَهُمْ وَدَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لَوْ تَغْفُلُونَ عَنْ أَسْلِحَتِكُمْ وَأَمْتِعَتِكُمْ فَيَمِيلُونَ عَلَيْكُمْ مَّيْلَةً وَاحِدَةً وَلاَ جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ إِن كَانَ بِكُمْ أَذًى مِّن مَّطَرٍ أَوْ كُنتُمْ مَّرْضَىۤ أَن تَضَعُوۤاْ أَسْلِحَتَكُمْ وَخُذُواْ حِذْرَكُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ أَعَدَّ لِلْكَافِرِينَ عَذَاباً مُّهِيناً,When you O Muhammad (s) are present among them while you all fear an enemy and you stand to lead them in prayer this type of address is customary in the Qur’ān let a party of them stand with you while another party stand back and let them the party standing with you take their weapons with them. Then when they have performed their prostrations that is when they have prayed let them the other party be behind you on guard until you complete the prayers; thereupon let this party go on guard and let another party who have not prayed come and pray with you taking their precautions and their weapons with them until you have completed the prayers. The Prophet s did this once at Batn Nakhla as reported by the two Shaykhs Bukhārī and Muslim. The disbelievers wish when you have stood up to pray that you should be heedless of your weapons and your baggage that they may descend upon you all at once by making an assault against you and capturing you and herein is the reasoning behind keeping weapons on oneself. You are not at fault if rain bothers you or if you are sick to lay aside your weapons and not carry them this implies that when there is no such excuse it is compulsory to carry them and this is one of two opinions held by al-Shāfi‘ī on this matter; the other opinion is that this precaution constitutes a sunna and this is the more preferable opinion. But take your precautions against the enemy and be on your guard as best you can; God has prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating chastisement.
فَإِذَا قَضَيْتُمُ ٱلصَّلَٰوةَ فَٱذْكُرُواْ ٱللَّهَ قِيَاماً وَقُعُوداً وَعَلَىٰ جُنُوبِكُمْ فَإِذَا ٱطْمَأْنَنتُمْ فَأَقِيمُواْ ٱلصَّلَٰوةَ إِنَّ ٱلصَّلَٰوةَ كَانَتْ عَلَى ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ كِتَٰباً مَّوْقُوتاً,When you have performed the prayer when you have completed it remember God by repeating ‘There is no god but God’ tahlīl and ‘Glory be to God’ tasbīh standing and sitting and on your sides lying down in other words in all states. Then when you are reassured when you are secure observe the prayer perform it with its proper due surely the prayer is for believers a prescription enjoined that is an obligation at specific times that is its appointed times are set and so it should not be postponed from these times.
وَلاَ تَهِنُواْ فِي ٱبْتِغَآءِ ٱلْقَوْمِ إِن تَكُونُواْ تَأْلَمُونَ فَإِنَّهُمْ يَأْلَمُونَ كَمَا تَأْلَمونَ وَتَرْجُونَ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ مَا لاَ يَرْجُونَ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ عَلِيماً حَكِيماً,After they returned from Uhud the Prophet s dispatched a group to seek out Abū Sufyān and his companions but they complained about their wounds and the following was revealed Be not faint be not weak in seeking in pursuing the enemy the disbelievers in order to fight them; if you are suffering if you have pains from a wound they are also suffering as you are suffering that is just like you yet they do not shrink from fighting you; and you hope from God in the way of victory and the reward for it that for which they cannot hope and since you have this advantage over them you should be more willing for it than them. God is ever Knower of all things Wise in His actions.
إِنَّآ أَنْزَلْنَا إِلَيْكَ ٱلْكِتَابَ بِٱلْحَقِّ لِتَحْكُمَ بَيْنَ ٱلنَّاسِ بِمَآ أَرَاكَ ٱللَّهُ وَلاَ تَكُنْ لِّلْخَآئِنِينَ خَصِيماً,Tu‘ma b. Ubayriq stole a coat of mail and hid it with a Jew. When it was discovered with the latter Tu‘ma accused him of having stolen it and swore by God that he Tu‘ma had not stolen it and his clan asked the Prophet s to advocate on his behalf and absolve him whereupon the following was revealed Surely We have revealed to you the Book the Qur’ān with the truth bi’l-haqq is semantically connected to anzalnā ‘We have revealed’ so that you may judge between people by that which God has shown you what God has taught you. And do not be a disputant for traitors like Tu‘ma disputing on their behalf.
وَٱسْتَغْفِرِ ٱللَّهَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ غَفُوراً رَّحِيماً,And pray for forgiveness from God for that which you considered doing; surely God is ever Forgiving Merciful.
وَلاَ تُجَادِلْ عَنِ ٱلَّذِينَ يَخْتَانُونَ أَنْفُسَهُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لاَ يُحِبُّ مَن كَانَ خَوَّاناً أَثِيماً,And do not dispute on behalf of those who betray themselves through acts of disobedience for the evil consequences of their betrayal shall fall on them; surely God loves not one who is treacherous frequently betraying and sinful that is to say He will punish him.
يَسْتَخْفُونَ مِنَ ٱلنَّاسِ وَلاَ يَسْتَخْفُونَ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ وَهُوَ مَعَهُمْ إِذْ يُبَيِّتُونَ مَا لاَ يَرْضَىٰ مِنَ ٱلْقَوْلِ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ بِمَا يَعْمَلُونَ مُحِيطاً,They the likes of Tu‘ma and his clan hide themselves in shame from people but they do not hide themselves from God; for He is with them in His knowledge of them while they plot they conspire at night with discourse displeasing to Him in their resolve to swear by God and deny the theft and accuse the Jew of it. God is ever Encompassing in knowledge of what they do.
هَٰأَنْتُمْ هَـٰؤُلاۤءِ جَٰدَلْتُمْ عَنْهُمْ فِي ٱلْحَيَٰوةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا فَمَن يُجَٰدِلُ ٱللَّهَ عَنْهُمْ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ أَمْ مَّن يَكُونُ عَلَيْهِمْ وَكِيلاً,Ah! There you are addressing Tu‘ma’s clan you have contested you have disputed on their behalf that is to say on behalf of Tu‘ma and his men a variant reading has ‘anhu ‘on his behalf’ in the life of this world; but who will contest against God on their behalf on the Day of Resurrection if He were to punish them or who will be a guardian for them and take charge of their affair or defend them? In other words no one will do such a thing.
وَمَن يَعْمَلْ سُوۤءاً أَوْ يَظْلِمْ نَفْسَهُ ثُمَّ يَسْتَغْفِرِ ٱللَّهَ يَجِدِ ٱللَّهَ غَفُوراً رَّحِيماً,Whoever does evil commits a sin by which another is harmed as when Tu‘ma falsely accused the Jew or wrongs himself committing a sin the consequences of which are limited to him and then prays for God’s forgiveness for it that is to say and then he repents he shall find God is Forgiving Merciful to him.
وَمَن يَكْسِبْ إِثْماً فَإِنَّمَا يَكْسِبُهُ عَلَىٰ نَفْسِهِ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ عَلِيماً حَكِيماً,And whoever commits a sin commits it against himself only since the evil consequences fall on him harming no one else; and God is ever Knower Wise in His actions.
وَمَن يَكْسِبْ خَطِيۤئَةً أَوْ إِثْماً ثُمَّ يَرْمِ بِهِ بَرِيئاً فَقَدِ ٱحْتَمَلَ بُهْتَاناً وَإِثْماً مُّبِيناً,And whoever commits a mistake a minor sin or a sin a grave sin and then casts it upon the innocent one who is innocent of it he has thereby burdened himself with calumny by his false accusation and a manifest sin one which is evident on account of what he has committed.
وَلَوْلاَ فَضْلُ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْكَ وَرَحْمَتُهُ لَهَمَّتْ طَّآئِفَةٌ مِّنْهُمْ أَن يُضِلُّوكَ وَمَا يُضِلُّونَ إِلاَّ أَنْفُسَهُمْ وَمَا يَضُرُّونَكَ مِن شَيْءٍ وَأَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْكَ ٱلْكِتَابَ وَٱلْحِكْمَةَ وَعَلَّمَكَ مَا لَمْ تَكُنْ تَعْلَمُ وَكَانَ فَضْلُ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْكَ عَظِيماً,Were it not for God’s bounty to you O Muhammad (s) and His mercy by way of protecting you a party of them of Tu‘ma’s clan would have intended would have conspired to lead you astray from judging with truth by deceiving you; but they lead only themselves astray; they will not hurt you at all since the evil consequence of their leading you astray would have fallen on them. God has revealed to you the Book the Qur’ān and wisdom the rulings contained therein and He has taught you what you did not know of rulings and the Unseen; and God’s bounty to you in this and other respects is ever great.
لاَّ خَيْرَ فِي كَثِيرٍ مِّن نَّجْوَاهُمْ إِلاَّ مَنْ أَمَرَ بِصَدَقَةٍ أَوْ مَعْرُوفٍ أَوْ إِصْلاَحٍ بَيْنَ ٱلنَّاسِ وَمَن يَفْعَلْ ذٰلِكَ ٱبْتِغَآءَ مَرْضَاتِ ٱللَّهِ فَسَوْفَ نُؤْتِيهِ أَجْراً عَظِيماً,There is no good in much of their that is of people’s secret conversations that is what they converse and talk secretly about except for the secret talk of he who enjoins to voluntary almsgiving or kindness a righteous deed or setting things right between people. And whoever does that the aforementioned desiring seeking God’s good pleasure and nothing else of the affairs of this world We shall surely give him read nu’tīhi or yu’tīhi ‘He will give him’ that is ‘God will give him’ a great wage.
وَمَن يُشَاقِقِ ٱلرَّسُولَ مِن بَعْدِ مَا تَبَيَّنَ لَهُ ٱلْهُدَىٰ وَيَتَّبِعْ غَيْرَ سَبِيلِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ نُوَلِّهِ مَا تَوَلَّىٰ وَنُصْلِهِ جَهَنَّمَ وَسَآءَتْ مَصِيراً,But whoever makes a breach with whoever opposes the Messenger in the truth that he brings after guidance has become clear to him after the truth has become manifest to him through miracles and follows a path other than the way of the believers that is to say other than the path they follow in religion by disbelieving We shall turn him over to what he has turned to We shall make him a leader of the misguidance which he has followed by leaving this as it is between them in this world and We shall expose him We shall admit him in the Hereafter in Hell where he will burn — an evil journey’s end an evil return it is.
إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لاَ يَغْفِرُ أَن يُشْرَكَ بِهِ وَيَغْفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذٰلِكَ لِمَن يَشَآءُ وَمَن يُشْرِكْ بِٱللَّهِ فَقَدْ ضَلَّ ضَلاَلاً بَعِيداً,God does not forgive that anything should be associated with Him; He forgives all except that to whomever He will. Whoever associates anything with God verily he has strayed far away from the truth.
إِن يَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِهِ إِلاَّ إِنَٰثاً وَإِن يَدْعُونَ إِلاَّ شَيْطَٰناً مَّرِيداً,What in is to be understand as mā ‘only’ they pray to what the idolaters worship instead of Him God that is other than Him are but females idols with feminine names such as al-Lāt al-‘Uzza and Manāt; and they in is to be understand as mā ‘only’ only pray to they only worship by worshipping these female idols a rebellious satan one who has rebelled against obedience to God for they are obeying him in this worship of female idols.
لَّعَنَهُ ٱللَّهُ وَقَالَ لأَتَّخِذَنَّ مِنْ عِبَادِكَ نَصِيباً مَّفْرُوضاً,God has cursed him He has removed him from His mercy. And he namely Satan said ‘Assuredly I will take to myself I will appoint for myself an appointed portion an apportioned share of Your servants whom I shall call to obey me.
وَلأُضِلَّنَّهُمْ وَلأُمَنِّيَنَّهُمْ وَلأَمُرَنَّهُمْ فَلَيُبَتِّكُنَّ ءَاذَانَ ٱلأَنْعَٰمِ وَلأَمُرَنَّهُمْ فَلَيُغَيِّرُنَّ خَلْقَ ٱللَّهِ وَمَن يَتَّخِذِ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنَ وَلِيّاً مِّن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ فَقَدْ خَسِرَ خُسْرَاناً مُّبِيناً,And I will surely lead them astray from truth with evil whisperings and surely I will fill them with desires I shall cast into their hearts thoughts that life will endure that there will be no resurrection and no reckoning; and surely I will command them and they will cut up the cattle’s ears and this was done to the she-camels they called bahā’ir. And surely I will command them and they will change God’s creation’ substituting His religion with unbelief making lawful what God has made unlawful and making unlawful what God has made lawful. And whoever takes Satan for a patron following him and obeying him instead of God has surely suffered a manifest loss one that is evident since he will end up in the Fire made perpetual for him.
يَعِدُهُمْ وَيُمَنِّيهِمْ وَمَا يَعِدُهُمُ ٱلشَّيْطَانُ إِلاَّ غُرُوراً,He promises them long life and fills them with desires of attaining their hopes in this world and that there will be neither resurrection nor requital; but what Satan promises them therewith is only delusion falsehood.
أُوْلَـٰئِكَ مَأْوَاهُمْ جَهَنَّمُ وَلاَ يَجِدُونَ عَنْهَا مَحِيصاً,For such — their abode shall be Hell and they shall find no refuge from it no alternative to it.
وَٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ سَنُدْخِلُهُمْ جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلأَنْهَارُ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَآ أَبَداً وَعْدَ ٱللَّهِ حَقّاً وَمَنْ أَصْدَقُ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ قِيلاً,But those who believe and perform righteous deeds We shall admit them to Gardens underneath which rivers flow abiding therein for ever; God’s promise in truth that is God promised them this and fulfilled it in truth; and who that is and none is truer in utterance that is in statement than God?
لَّيْسَ بِأَمَـٰنِيِّكُمْ وَلاۤ أَمَانِيِّ أَهْلِ ٱلْكِتَابِ مَن يَعْمَلْ سُوۤءًا يُجْزَ بِهِ وَلاَ يَجِدْ لَهُ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ وَلِيّاً وَلاَ نَصِيراً,When the Muslims and the People of the Scripture began to pride themselves upon God’s promise the following was revealed It this matter is not dependent upon your desires nor the desires of the People of the Scripture but upon righteous deeds. Whoever does evil shall be requited for it either in the Hereafter or in this life through trials and tribulations as is stated in hadīth; and he will not find besides God that is other than Him any friend to protect him or helper to defend him against Him.
وَمَن يَعْمَلْ مِنَ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ مِن ذَكَرٍ أَوْ أُنْثَىٰ وَهُوَ مُؤْمِنٌ فَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ يَدْخُلُونَ ٱلْجَنَّةَ وَلاَ يُظْلَمُونَ نَقِيراً,And whoever does any righteous deeds whether male or female and is a believer — such shall be admitted into read passive yudkhalūna or active yadkhulūna ‘they shall enter’ Paradise and not be wronged by as much as the dint in a date-stone.
وَمَنْ أَحْسَنُ دِيناً مِمَّنْ أَسْلَمَ وَجْهَهُ لله وَهُوَ مُحْسِنٌ واتَّبَعَ مِلَّةَ إِبْرَٰهِيمَ حَنِيفاً وَٱتَّخَذَ ٱللَّهُ إِبْرَاهِيمَ خَلِيلاً,And who that is and none is fairer in religion than he who submits his purpose that is than he who is compliant and offers his deeds sincerely to God and is virtuous and declares God’s Oneness and who follows the creed of Abraham the one that is in accordance with the creed of Islam as a hanīf? hanīfan is a circumstantial qualifier that is to say one inclining away from all religions to the upright religion. And God took Abraham for a close friend as His elect one whose love for Him is pure.
وَللَّهِ مَا فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ مُّحِيطاً,To God belongs all that is in the heavens and in the earth as possessions creatures and servants; and God is ever the Encompasser of all things in knowledge and power that is He is ever possessed of such attributes.
وَيَسْتَفْتُونَكَ فِي ٱلنِّسَآءِ قُلِ ٱللَّهُ يُفْتِيكُمْ فِيهِنَّ وَمَا يُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْكُمْ فِي ٱلْكِتَٰبِ فِي يَتَٰمَى ٱلنِّسَآءِ ٱلَّٰتِي لاَ تُؤْتُونَهُنَّ مَا كُتِبَ لَهُنَّ وَتَرْغَبُونَ أَن تَنكِحُوهُنَّ وَٱلْمُسْتَضْعَفِينَ مِنَ ٱلْوِلْدَٰنِ وَأَن تَقُومُواْ لِلْيَتَٰمَىٰ بِٱلْقِسْطِ وَمَا تَفْعَلُواْ مِنْ خَيْرٍ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ بِهِ عَلِيماً,They will ask you for a pronouncement concerning the matter of women and their inheritance. Say to them ‘God pronounces to you concerning them and what is recited to you in the Book the Qur’ān in the ‘inheritance’ verse Q. 411 and He also pronounces to you concerning the orphan women to whom you do not give what is prescribed what is obligatory for them of inheritance for you O guardians who desire not to marry them because of their ugliness and you prevent them from marrying others coveting their inheritance in other words God pronounces to you not to do this; and concerning the oppressed young children that you give them what is their due and He also commands you that you deal justly equitably with orphans with respect to inheritance and dowry. Whatever good you do God is ever Knower of it’ and He will requite you for it.
وَإِنِ ٱمْرَأَةٌ خَافَتْ مِن بَعْلِهَا نُشُوزاً أَوْ إِعْرَاضاً فَلاَ جُنَاْحَ عَلَيْهِمَآ أَن يُصْلِحَا بَيْنَهُمَا صُلْحاً وَٱلصُّلْحُ خَيْرٌ وَأُحْضِرَتِ ٱلأنْفُسُ ٱلشُّحَّ وَإِن تُحْسِنُواْ وَتَتَّقُواْ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيراً,And if a woman wa-in imra’atun is in the nominative because of it being the subject of the explicative verb that follows fears anticipates from her husband ill-treatment if he looks down on her by refraining to sleep with her or by not maintaining her adequately because he is averse to her and aspires to one more beautiful than her or rejection turning his face away from her they are not at fault if they are reconciled through some agreement in terms of shares and maintenance expenses so that she concedes something to him in return for continuing companionship; if she agrees to this then that is fine but if she does not then the husband must either give her all her due or part with her an yassālahā ‘they reconcile’ the original tā’ of yatasālahā has been assimilated with the sād; a variant reading has an yuslihā from the fourth form aslaha; reconciliation is better than separation ill-treatment or rejection. God exalted be He in explaining the natural disposition of man says But greed has been made present in the souls al-shuhh is extreme niggardliness meaning that they have a natural propensity for this as if they the souls are ever in its presence never absent from it. The meaning is a woman would scarcely allow another to share her husband with her and a man would scarcely allow her to enjoy him if he were to fall in love with another. If you are virtuous in your conjugal life with women and fear being unjust to them surely God is ever aware of what you do and He will requite you for it.
وَلَن تَسْتَطِيعُوۤاْ أَن تَعْدِلُواْ بَيْنَ ٱلنِّسَآءِ وَلَوْ حَرَصْتُمْ فَلاَ تَمِيلُواْ كُلَّ ٱلْمَيْلِ فَتَذَرُوهَا كَٱلْمُعَلَّقَةِ وَإِن تُصْلِحُواْ وَتَتَّقُواْ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ غَفُوراً رَّحِيماً,You will never be able to be just to to treat equally your wives in terms of love even if you be eager for this; yet do not turn altogether away towards the one you love with respect to the shares and maintenance expenses so that you leave her the one from whom you turn away like one suspended one that is neither a slavegirl nor a woman with a husband. If you set things right by being just with the shares and fear injustice surely God is ever Forgiving regarding the inclination in your hearts Merciful to you in this respect.
وَإِن يَتَفَرَّقَا يُغْنِ ٱللَّهُ كُلاًّ مِّن سَعَتِهِ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ وَاسِعاً حَكِيماً,But if they the married couple separate by way of divorce God will compensate each of them from the need of the other out of His plenty that is out of His bounty by giving her another as husband and giving him another as wife. God is ever Embracing of His creatures in bounty Wise in what He has ordained for them.
وَللَّهِ مَا فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَلَقَدْ وَصَّيْنَا ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ ٱلْكِتَابَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ وَإِيَّاكُمْ أَنِ ٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَإِن تَكْفُرُواْ فَإِنَّ للَّهِ مَا فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ غَنِيّاً حَمِيداً,To God belongs all that is in the heavens and in the earth. We have charged those who were given the Scripture meaning the scriptures before you namely the Jews and Christians and you O people of the Qur’ān ‘Fear God’ fear His punishment by being obedient to Him. And We said to them and to you ‘If you disbelieve in what you have been charged with then to God belongs all that is in the heavens and in the earth’ as creatures possessions and servants and He will not be harmed by your disbelief God is ever Independent of the need for His creation or their worship Praised praise-worthy for what He does with them.
وَللَّهِ مَا فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَكَفَىٰ بِٱللَّهِ وَكِيلاً,To God belongs all that is in the heavens and in the earth He has repeated this in order to reaffirm the reason why fear of God is necessary; God suffices as a Guardian witnessing the fact that what is contained in them belongs to Him.
إِن يَشَأْ يُذْهِبْكُمْ أَيُّهَا ٱلنَّاسُ وَيَأْتِ بِآخَرِينَ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ ذٰلِكَ قَدِيراً,If He will He can remove you O people and bring others instead of you surely God is ever able to do that.
مَّن كَانَ يُرِيدُ ثَوَابَ ٱلدُّنْيَا فَعِندَ ٱللَّهِ ثَوَابُ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَٱلآخِرَةِ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ سَمِيعاً بَصِيراً,Whoever desires by his deeds the reward of this world then God has the reward of this world and of the Hereafter for the one who wants it and no one else has it so why do any of you demand the lower reward? Why do you not seek the higher one by devoting yourself sincerely to Him since what reward he seeks can only be found with Him; God is ever Hearer Seer.
يَٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ كُونُواْ قَوَّٰمِينَ بِٱلْقِسْطِ شُهَدَآءَ للَّهِ وَلَوْ عَلَىۤ أَنْفُسِكُمْ أَوِ ٱلْوَٰلِدَيْنِ وَٱلأَقْرَبِينَ إِن يَكُنْ غَنِيّاً أَوْ فَقِيراً فَٱللَّهُ أَوْلَىٰ بِهِمَا فَلاَ تَتَّبِعُواْ ٱلْهَوَىٰ أَن تَعْدِلُواْ وَإِن تَلْوُواْ أَوْ تُعْرِضُواْ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيراً,O you who believe be upright in justice; witnesses of the truth for God even though it the witnessing be against yourselves so be witness against them your selves by affirming the truth and not concealing it; or against parents and kinsmen whether the person witnessed against be rich or poor; God is closer to the two than you and He has better knowledge of what is good for them. So do not follow any whim in your testimonies by being partial to the rich one seeking his pleasure or by being partial to the poor one out of compassion for him lest you swerve so that you do not incline away from the truth for if you twist a variant reading for talwūw has talū if you distort your testimony or refrain from giving it surely God is ever aware of what you do and will requite you accordingly.
يَٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ ءَامِنُواْ بِٱللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ وَٱلْكِتَٰبِ ٱلَّذِي نَزَّلَ عَلَىٰ رَسُولِهِ وَٱلْكِتَٰبِ ٱلَّذِيۤ أَنزَلَ مِن قَبْلُ وَمَن يَكْفُرْ بِٱللَّهِ وَمَلآئِكَتِهِ وَكُتُبِهِ وَرُسُلِهِ وَٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلآخِرِ فَقَدْ ضَلَّ ضَلاَلاً بَعِيداً,O you who believe believe with perseverance in God and His Messenger and the Book which has been revealed to His Messenger Muhammad (s) and that is the Qur’ān; and the Book which was revealed before to the messengers namely the scriptures a variant reading for nuzzila and unzila ‘was revealed’ has the active form for both verbs nazzala and anzala ‘He revealed’. And whoever disbelieves in God and His angels and His Books and His messengers and the Last Day verily he has strayed far away from the truth.
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ ثُمَّ كَفَرُواْ ثُمَّ آمَنُواْ ثُمَّ كَفَرُواْ ثُمَّ ٱزْدَادُواْ كُفْراً لَّمْ يَكُنِ ٱللَّهُ لِيَغْفِرَ لَهُمْ وَلاَ لِيَهْدِيَهُمْ سَبِيلاً,Verily those who believed in Moses namely the Jews and then disbelieved by worshipping the calf and then believed after that and then disbelieved in Jesus and then increased in disbelief in Muhammad — it was not for God to forgive them for what they have persisted in of disbelief nor to guide them to a way to the truth.
بَشِّرِ ٱلْمُنَافِقِينَ بِأَنَّ لَهُمْ عَذَاباً أَلِيماً,Give tidings to inform O Muhammad (s) the hypocrites that for them there is a painful chastisement namely the chastisement of the Fire.
ٱلَّذِينَ يَتَّخِذُونَ ٱلْكَافِرِينَ أَوْلِيَآءَ مِن دُونِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ أَيَبْتَغُونَ عِندَهُمُ ٱلْعِزَّةَ فَإِنَّ ٱلعِزَّةَ للَّهِ جَمِيعاً,Those who alladhīna is either a substitution for or an adjectival qualification of al-munāfiqīna ‘the hypocrites’ take disbelievers for friends instead of believers because they mistakenly believe them to be strong — do they desire do they seek power with them? an interrogative of disavowal that is to say they shall not find such power with them. Truly power belongs altogether to God in this world and the Hereafter and none but His friends shall attain it.
وَقَدْ نَزَّلَ عَلَيْكُمْ فِي ٱلْكِتَٰبِ أَنْ إِذَا سَمِعْتُمْ آيَاتِ ٱللَّهِ يُكْفَرُ بِهَا وَيُسْتَهْزَأُ بِهَا فَلاَ تَقْعُدُواْ مَعَهُمْ حَتَّىٰ يَخُوضُواْ فِي حَدِيثٍ غَيْرِهِ إِنَّكُمْ إِذاً مِّثْلُهُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ جَامِعُ ٱلْمُنَٰفِقِينَ وَٱلْكَٰفِرِينَ فِي جَهَنَّمَ جَمِيعاً,It has been revealed read active nazzala ‘He has revealed’ or passive nuzzila ‘It has been revealed’ to you in the Book in the Qur’ān in sūrat al-An‘ām Q. 668 that an has been softened and its subject omitted in other words read it as annahu ‘When you hear God’s signs the Qur’ān being disbelieved in and mocked do not sit with them that is the disbelievers and the mockers until they engage in some other talk for otherwise you if you were to sit with them would surely be like them’ in sinfulness. God will gather the hypocrites and disbelievers all together into Hell just as they were gathered together in this world in unbelief and mockery.
ٱلَّذِينَ يَتَرَبَّصُونَ بِكُمْ فَإِن كَانَ لَكُمْ فَتْحٌ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ قَالُوۤاْ أَلَمْ نَكُنْ مَّعَكُمْ وَإِن كَانَ لِلْكَافِرِينَ نَصِيبٌ قَالُوۤاْ أَلَمْ نَسْتَحْوِذْ عَلَيْكُمْ وَنَمْنَعْكُمْ مِّنَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ فَٱللَّهُ يَحْكُمُ بَيْنَكُمْ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ وَلَن يَجْعَلَ ٱللَّهُ لِلْكَافِرِينَ عَلَى ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ سَبِيلاً,Those who alladhīna substitutes for the previous alladhīna of verse 139 wait in watch for you hoping for misfortunes to befall you and if a victory such as a conquest or booty comes to you from God say to you ‘Were we not with you?’ in religion and in the struggle? So give us from the booty; but if the disbelievers have some luck by gaining a victory over you they say to them ‘Did we not gain mastery authority over you capable of capturing you and slaying you but we spared you and did we not defend you against the believers?’ lest they be victorious over you by forsaking them and apprising you of their plans and thus have we not done you a favour? God exalted be He says God will judge between you and them on the Day of Resurrection admitting you into Paradise and them into the Fire; and God will never grant the disbelievers a way a means to success over the believers by annihilating them.
إِنَّ ٱلْمُنَافِقِينَ يُخَادِعُونَ ٱللَّهَ وَهُوَ خَادِعُهُمْ وَإِذَا قَامُوۤاْ إِلَى ٱلصَّلاَةِ قَامُواْ كُسَالَىٰ يُرَآءُونَ ٱلنَّاسَ وَلاَ يَذْكُرُونَ ٱللَّهَ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً,The hypocrites seek to trick God by manifesting the opposite of what they hide in themselves of unbelief in order to escape His rulings in this world; but He is tricking them He will requite them for their trickery and so they will be disgraced in this world through God apprising His Prophet of what they hide and punished in the Hereafter. When they stand up to pray with the believers they stand up lazily reluctantly and for their prayers to be seen by people and they do not remember pray to God save a little for ostentation.
مُّذَبْذَبِينَ بَيْنَ ذٰلِكَ لاَ إِلَىٰ هَـٰؤُلاۤءِ وَلاَ إِلَى هَـٰؤُلاۤءِ وَمَن يُضْلِلِ ٱللَّهُ فَلَن تَجِدَ لَهُ سَبِيلاً,Wavering hesitant all the time between that unbelief and belief — not belonging to these disbelievers neither to those believers; and he whom God sends astray you will never find for him a way a path back to guidance.
يَا أَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ لاَ تَتَّخِذُواْ ٱلْكَافِرِينَ أَوْلِيَآءَ مِن دُونِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ أَتُرِيدُونَ أَن تَجْعَلُواْ للَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ سُلْطَاناً مُّبِيناً,O you who believe take not the disbelievers as friends instead of the believers do you desire to give God over you by your taking them as friends a clear warrant? a manifest proof of your hypocrisy?
إِنَّ ٱلْمُنَافِقِينَ فِي ٱلدَّرْكِ ٱلأَسْفَلِ مِنَ ٱلنَّارِ وَلَن تَجِدَ لَهُمْ نَصِيراً,Verily the hypocrites will be in the lowest level place of the Fire that is its bottom; and you will never find a helper for them anyone to guard them from the Fire.
إِلاَّ ٱلَّذِينَ تَابُواْ وَأَصْلَحُواْ وَٱعْتَصَمُواْ بِٱللَّهِ وَأَخْلَصُواْ دِينَهُمْ للَّهِ فَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ مَعَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَسَوْفَ يُؤْتِ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ أَجْراً عَظِيماً,Save those who repent of hypocrisy and make amends in their deeds and hold fast to put their trust in God and make their religion purely God’s free from any pretence; those are with the believers in terms of what they shall be given; and God will certainly give the believers a great wage in the Hereafter and that is Paradise.
مَّا يَفْعَلُ ٱللَّهُ بِعَذَابِكُمْ إِن شَكَرْتُمْ وَآمَنْتُمْ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ شَاكِراً عَلِيماً,Why would God chastise you if you are thankful of His favours and believe in Him? the interrogative is meant as a denial in other words He would not punish you. God is ever Thankful of the deeds of believers rewarding them Knowing of His creation.
لاَّ يُحِبُّ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْجَهْرَ بِٱلسُّوۤءِ مِنَ ٱلْقَوْلِ إِلاَّ مَن ظُلِمَ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ سَمِيعاً عَلِيماً,God does not like the utterance of evil words out loud by any person that is to say He will punish him for it unless a person has been wronged in which case He would not punish him for uttering it out loud when he is informing others of the wrong done to him by the wrong-doer or summoning them against him. God is ever Hearer of what is said Knower of what is done.
إِن تُبْدُواْ خَيْراً أَوْ تُخْفُوهُ أَوْ تَعْفُواْ عَن سُوۤءٍ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ عَفُوّاً قَدِيراً,If you show manifest good in the way of pious deeds or conceal it if you do it in secret or pardon evil injustice then surely God is ever Pardoning Powerful.
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يَكْفُرُونَ بِٱللَّهِ وَرُسُلِهِ وَيُرِيدُونَ أَن يُفَرِّقُواْ بَيْنَ ٱللَّهِ وَرُسُلِهِ وَيقُولُونَ نُؤْمِنُ بِبَعْضٍ وَنَكْفُرُ بِبَعْضٍ وَيُرِيدُونَ أَن يَتَّخِذُواْ بَيْنَ ذٰلِكَ سَبِيلاً,Those who disbelieve in God and His messengers and seek to divide between God and His messengers by believing in Him but not in them and say ‘We believe in some of the messengers and disbelieve in some’ of the others and seek to adopt a way a path to follow between them between unbelief and belief.
أُوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْكَافِرُونَ حَقّاً وَأَعْتَدْنَا لِلْكَافِرِينَ عَذَاباً مُّهِيناً,Those are the disbelievers truly haqqan is the verbal noun emphasising the content of what precedes it in the sentence; and We have prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating chastisement namely the chastisement of the Fire.
وَٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ بِٱللَّهِ وَرُسُلِهِ وَلَمْ يُفَرِّقُواْ بَيْنَ أَحَدٍ مِّنْهُمْ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ سَوْفَ يُؤْتِيهِمْ أُجُورَهُمْ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ غَفُوراً رَّحِيماً,And those who believe in God and all of His messengers and do not seek to divide between any of them those — We shall surely give them nu’tīhim also read yu’tīhim ‘He shall surely give them’ their wages the reward for their deeds. God is ever Forgiving to His friends Merciful to those who obey Him.
يَسْأَلُكَ أَهْلُ ٱلْكِتَابِ أَن تُنَزِّلَ عَلَيْهِمْ كِتَاباً مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ فَقَدْ سَأَلُواْ مُوسَىٰ أَكْبَرَ مِن ذٰلِكَ فَقَالُوۤاْ أَرِنَا ٱللَّهَ جَهْرَةً فَأَخَذَتْهُمُ ٱلصَّاعِقَةُ بِظُلْمِهِمْ ثُمَّ ٱتَّخَذُواْ ٱلْعِجْلَ مِن بَعْدِ مَا جَآءَتْهُمُ ٱلْبَيِّنَاتُ فَعَفَوْنَا عَن ذٰلِكَ وَآتَيْنَا مُوسَىٰ سُلْطَاناً مُّبِيناً,The People of the Scripture the Jews will ask of you O Muhammad (s) to cause a Book to be revealed to them from the heaven all at once as was revealed to Moses merely to harass you. If you consider this shocking then know that they their forefathers asked Moses for something greater than that for they said ‘Show us God openly’ before our eyes; so the thunderbolt death seized them as punishment for them for their evildoing when they harassed him Moses with this demand. They then took to themselves the golden calf for a god after clear proofs the miracles testifying to God’s Oneness had come to them; yet We pardoned that and did not annihilate them; and We bestowed upon Moses clear authority evident and manifest sway over them for when he commanded them to slay themselves in repentance they obeyed him.
وَرَفَعْنَا فَوْقَهُمُ ٱلطُّورَ بِمِيثَاقِهِمْ وَقُلْنَا لَهُمُ ٱدْخُلُواْ ٱلْبَابَ سُجَّداً وَقُلْنَا لَهُمْ لاَ تَعْدُواْ فِي ٱلسَّبْتِ وَأَخَذْنَا مِنْهُمْ مِّيثَاقاً غَلِيظاً,And We raised above them the Mount by the covenant with them that is on account of the covenant made with them that they might fear and so they accepted it; and We said to them while it cast a shadow hovering above them ‘Enter the gate the gate of the town bowing’; and We said to them ‘Transgress not a variant reading of lā ta‘dū is lā ta‘addū where the original tā’ of lā tata‘addū is assimilated with the dāl in other words it is similar in meaning to lā ta‘tadū ‘do not act unjustly in’ the Sabbath’ by fishing during it and We took from them a firm covenant over this but they broke it.
فَبِمَا نَقْضِهِم مِّيثَاقَهُمْ وَكُفْرِهِم بَآيَاتِ ٱللَّهِ وَقَتْلِهِمُ ٱلأَنْبِيَآءَ بِغَيْرِ حَقٍّ وَقَوْلِهِمْ قُلُوبُنَا غُلْفٌ بَلْ طَبَعَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْهَا بِكُفْرِهِمْ فَلاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً,So for their breaking fa-bi-mā naqdihim the mā is extra; the bā’ is causative and connected to a missing element such as sabab ‘reason’ in other words it should be understood as la‘annāhum bi-sabab naqdihim ‘We cursed them for the reason of their breaking’ their covenant and disbelieving in the signs of God and slaying the prophets wrongfully and for their saying to the Prophet s ‘Our hearts are covered up’ and cannot grasp what you say — nay but God sealed them for their disbelief and so they cannot heed any admonition; so they do not believe except for a few among them like ‘Abd Allāh b. Salām and his companions.
وَبِكُفْرِهِمْ وَقَوْلِهِمْ عَلَىٰ مَرْيَمَ بُهْتَاناً عَظِيماً,And for their disbelief a second time in Jesus the bā’ of bi-kufrihim ‘for their disbelief’ is repeated in order to separate it ‘their disbelief’ in Jesus from what is supplemented to it ‘their utterance against Mary’ and their uttering against Mary a tremendous calumny when they accused her of fornication.
وَقَوْلِهِمْ إِنَّا قَتَلْنَا ٱلْمَسِيحَ عِيسَى ٱبْنَ مَرْيَمَ رَسُولَ ٱللَّهِ وَمَا قَتَلُوهُ وَمَا صَلَبُوهُ وَلَـٰكِن شُبِّهَ لَهُمْ وَإِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱخْتَلَفُواْ فِيهِ لَفِي شَكٍّ مِّنْهُ مَا لَهُمْ بِهِ مِنْ عِلْمٍ إِلاَّ ٱتِّبَاعَ ٱلظَّنِّ وَمَا قَتَلُوهُ يَقِيناً,And for their saying boastfully ‘We slew the Messiah Jesus son of Mary the Messenger of God’ as they claim in other words for all of these reasons We have punished them. God exalted be He says in repudiating their claim to have killed him And yet they did not slay him nor did they crucify him but he the one slain and crucified who was an associate of theirs the Jews was given the resemblance of Jesus. In other words God cast his Jesus’s likeness to him and so they thought it was him Jesus. And those who disagree concerning him that is concerning Jesus are surely in doubt regarding the slaying of him for some of them said when they saw the slain man the face is that of Jesus but the body is not his and so it is not he; and others said no it is he. They do not have any knowledge of the slaying of him only the pursuit of conjecture illā ittibā‘a l-zann is a discontinuous exception in other words ‘instead they follow conjecture regarding him that which they imagined they saw’; and they did not slay him for certain yaqīnan a circumstantial qualifier emphasising the denial of the slaying.
بَل رَّفَعَهُ ٱللَّهُ إِلَيْهِ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ عَزِيزاً حَكِيماً,Nay God raised him up to Him. God is ever Mighty in His kingdom Wise in His actions.
وَإِن مِّنْ أَهْلِ ٱلْكِتَابِ إِلاَّ لَيُؤْمِنَنَّ بِهِ قَبْلَ مَوْتِهِ وَيَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ يَكُونُ عَلَيْهِمْ شَهِيداً,And there is not one of the People of the Scripture but will assuredly believe in him in Jesus before his death that is before the death of one belonging to the People of the Scripture upon seeing the angels of death with his very eyes at which point his faith will not profit him; or it means before the death of Jesus after he descends at the approach of the Hour as is stated in hadīth; and on the Day of Resurrection he Jesus will be a witness against them of what they did when he was sent to them.
فَبِظُلْمٍ مِّنَ ٱلَّذِينَ هَادُواْ حَرَّمْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ طَيِّبَاتٍ أُحِلَّتْ لَهُمْ وَبِصَدِّهِمْ عَن سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ كَثِيراً,And because of the evildoing fa-bi-zulmin is to be understood as fa-bi-sababi zulmin ‘and for the reason of the evildoing’ of some of those of Jewry the Jews We have forbidden them certain good things that were lawful for them those things mentioned where God says And to those of Jewry We have forbidden every beast with claws Q. 6146; and because of their barring of people from God’s way from His religion many a time.
وَأَخْذِهِمُ ٱلرِّبَا وَقَدْ نُهُواْ عَنْهُ وَأَكْلِهِمْ أَمْوَالَ ٱلنَّاسِ بِٱلْبَاطِلِ وَأَعْتَدْنَا لِلْكَافِرِينَ مِنْهُمْ عَذَاباً أَلِيماً,And because of their taking usury when they had been forbidden it in the Torah and their consuming people’s wealth through falsehood through bribes in adjudications and We have prepared for the disbelievers among them a painful chastisement.
لَّـٰكِنِ ٱلرَّاسِخُونَ فِي ٱلْعِلْمِ مِنْهُمْ وَٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِمَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيكَ وَمَآ أُنزِلَ مِن قَبْلِكَ وَٱلْمُقِيمِينَ ٱلصَّلاَةَ وَٱلْمُؤْتُونَ ٱلزَّكَاةَ وَٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلآخِرِ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ سَنُؤْتِيهِمْ أَجْراً عَظِيماً,But those of them who are firmly rooted established in knowledge like ‘Abd Allāh b. Salām and the believers the Emigrants and the Helpers believing in what has revealed to you and what was revealed before you of scriptures and those who observe the prayer wa’l-muqīmīna l-salāta is in the accusative because it is a laudative; it is also read in the nominative wa’l-muqīmūna l-salāta; and pay the alms and those who believe in God and the Last Day — to them We shall surely give nu’tīhim is also read yu’tīhim ‘He shall surely give’ a great wage namely Paradise.
إِنَّآ أَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَيْكَ كَمَآ أَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَىٰ نُوحٍ وَٱلنَّبِيِّينَ مِن بَعْدِهِ وَأَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَىٰ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَإِسْمَاعِيلَ وَإسْحَاقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ وَٱلأَسْبَاطِ وَعِيسَىٰ وَأَيُّوبَ وَيُونُسَ وَهَارُونَ وَسُلَيْمَانَ وَآتَيْنَا دَاوُودَ زَبُوراً,We have revealed to you as We revealed to Noah and the prophets after him and as We revealed to Abraham and his two sons Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob the son of Isaac and the Tribes his Jacob’s children and Jesus and Job and Jonah and Aaron and Solomon and We gave to his father David the Inscribed Book read zabūran it would denote the name of the revealed Book cf. the Psalms; read zubūran would make it a verbal noun meaning mazbūran that is to say maktūban ‘inscribed’.
وَرُسُلاً قَدْ قَصَصْنَاهُمْ عَلَيْكَ مِن قَبْلُ وَرُسُلاً لَّمْ نَقْصُصْهُمْ عَلَيْكَ وَكَلَّمَ ٱللَّهُ مُوسَىٰ تَكْلِيماً,And We sent messengers We have told you of before and messengers We have not told you of it is related that God sent eight thousand prophets in total four thousand of them from the Children of Israel and the remaining four thousand from other peoples as stated by the Shaykh Jalāl al-Dīn al-Mahallī in his commentary on sūrat Ghāfir Q. 4078; and God spoke directly without mediation to Moses
رُّسُلاً مُّبَشِّرِينَ وَمُنذِرِينَ لِئَلاَّ يَكُونَ لِلنَّاسِ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ حُجَّةٌ بَعْدَ ٱلرُّسُلِ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ عَزِيزاً حَكِيماً,messengers rusulan substitutes for the previous rusulan ‘messengers’ bearing good tidings of reward for those that believe and warning of punishment for those that disbelieve; We sent them so that people might have no argument to make against God after the sending of the messengers to them and say Our Lord why did you not send a messenger to us so that we might follow Your signs and be among the believers Q. 2847; thus We sent them to pre-empt such excuses. God is ever Mighty in His kingdom Wise in His actions.
لَّـٰكِنِ ٱللَّهُ يَشْهَدُ بِمَآ أَنزَلَ إِلَيْكَ أَنزَلَهُ بِعِلْمِهِ وَٱلْمَلاۤئِكَةُ يَشْهَدُونَ وَكَفَىٰ بِٱللَّهِ شَهِيداً,When the Jews were asked about his Muhammad’s prophethood s and they denied him the following was revealed But God bears witness He makes clear the truth of your prophethood with what He has revealed to you of the miraculous Qur’ān; He has revealed it enveloped through His knowledge that is He has revealed it knowing it fully or He has revealed it with His knowledge therein; and the angels also bear witness to you; and God suffices as a Witness to this.
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَصَدُّواْ عَن سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ قَدْ ضَلُّواْ ضَلَٰلاً بَعِيداً,Surely those who disbelieve in God and bar people from the way of God from the religion of Islam by concealing the descriptions of Muhammad (s) and these are the Jews they have indeed gone far astray from the truth.
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَظَلَمُواْ لَمْ يَكُنِ ٱللَّهُ لِيَغْفِرَ لَهُمْ وَلاَ لِيَهْدِيَهُمْ طَرِيقاً,Surely those who disbelieve in God and who have done wrong to the Prophet by concealing his descriptions it is not for God to forgive them neither to guide them to any path whatever
إِلاَّ طَرِيقَ جَهَنَّمَ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَآ أَبَداً وَكَانَ ذٰلِكَ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ يَسِيراً,except for the path of Hell that is to the path that leads to it abiding it is decreed for them to abide therein once they enter it forever; and for God that is an easy matter.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّاسُ قَدْ جَآءَكُمُ ٱلرَّسُولُ بِٱلْحَقِّ مِن رَّبِّكُمْ فَآمِنُواْ خَيْراً لَّكُمْ وَإِن تَكْفُرُواْ فَإِنَّ للَّهِ مَا فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ عَلِيماً حَكِيماً,O people of Mecca the Messenger Muhammad (s) has now come to you with the truth from your Lord; so believe in him and seek what it is better for you than that which you are presently seeking. And if you disbelieve in him then surely to God belongs all that is in the heavens and in the earth as possessions creatures and servants and your disbelief will not harm Him; and God is ever Knowing of His creation Wise in what He does with them.
يٰأَهْلَ ٱلْكِتَابِ لاَ تَغْلُواْ فِي دِينِكُمْ وَلاَ تَقُولُواْ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ إِلاَّ ٱلْحَقَّ إِنَّمَا ٱلْمَسِيحُ عِيسَى ٱبْنُ مَرْيَمَ رَسُولُ ٱللَّهِ وَكَلِمَتُهُ أَلْقَاهَا إِلَىٰ مَرْيَمَ وَرُوحٌ مِّنْهُ فَآمِنُواْ بِٱللَّهِ وَرُسُلِهِ وَلاَ تَقُولُواْ ثَلاَثَةٌ ٱنتَهُواْ خَيْراً لَّكُمْ إِنَّمَا ٱللَّهُ إِلَـٰهٌ وَاحِدٌ سُبْحَانَهُ أَن يَكُونَ لَهُ وَلَدٌ لَّهُ مَا فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَكَفَىٰ بِٱللَّهِ وَكِيلاً,O People of the Scripture the Gospel do not go to extremes do not go beyond the bounds in your religion and do not say about God except the saying of the truth such as exalting Him above any associations with a partner or a child the Messiah Jesus the son of Mary was only the Messenger of God and His Word which He cast to which He conveyed to Mary and a spirit that is one whose spirit is from Him he Jesus is here attached to God exalted be He as an honouring for him and not as you claim that he is the son of God or a god alongside Him or one of three because one that possesses a spirit is compound while God transcends being compound and the attribution of compounds to Him. So believe in God and His messengers and do not say that the gods are ‘Three’ God Jesus and his mother. Refrain from this and say what it is better for you to say which is the profession of His Oneness. Verily God is but One God. Glory be to Him transcending the possibility that He should have a son! To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and in the earth as possessions creatures and servants and such sovereignty is not compatible with that prophethood of Jesus. God suffices as a Guardian a Witness to this.
لَّن يَسْتَنكِفَ ٱلْمَسِيحُ أَن يَكُونَ عَبْداً للَّهِ وَلاَ ٱلْمَلاۤئِكَةُ ٱلْمُقَرَّبُونَ وَمَن يَسْتَنْكِفْ عَنْ عِبَادَتِهِ وَيَسْتَكْبِرْ فَسَيَحْشُرُهُمْ إِلَيهِ جَمِيعاً,The Messiah whom you claim is a god would never disdain would never scorn or reject haughtily to be a servant of God neither would the angels who are nigh to God disdain to be servants this is a splendid digression to the matter of the angels and it is mentioned as a refutation of those who claim that they the angels are gods or the daughters of God just as He refuted with what was stated before the Christians who claim that which is the subject of the address to them above. Whoever disdains to worship Him and waxes proud He will assuredly muster them to Him all of them in the Hereafter.
فَأَمَّا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ فَيُوَفِّيهِمْ أُجُورَهُمْ وَيَزيدُهُمْ مِّن فَضْلِهِ وَأَمَّا ٱلَّذِينَ ٱسْتَنكَفُواْ وَٱسْتَكْبَرُواْ فَيُعَذِّبُهُمْ عَذَاباً أَلِيماً وَلاَ يَجِدُونَ لَهُمْ مِّن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ وَلِيّاً وَلاَ نَصِيراً,As for those who believed who did righteous deeds He will pay them in full their wages the reward for their deeds and He will give them more of His bounty what no eye has seen no ear has heard and no man’s heart has ever wished for; and as for them who disdain and are too proud to worship Him He will chastise them with a painful chastisement which is the chastisement of the Fire and they shall not find for themselves besides God that is other than Him any friend to ward it off them or helper to protect them from it.
يَا أَيُّهَا ٱلنَّاسُ قَدْ جَآءَكُمْ بُرْهَانٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَأَنْزَلْنَآ إِلَيْكُمْ نُوراً مُّبِيناً,O people a proof a definitive argument has now come to you from your Lord against you namely the Prophet s and We have revealed to you a manifest a clear light namely the Qur’ān.
فَأَمَّا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱعْتَصَمُواْ بِهِ فَسَيُدْخِلُهُمْ فِي رَحْمَةٍ مِّنْهُ وَفَضْلٍ وَيَهْدِيهِمْ إِلَيْهِ صِرَاطاً مُّسْتَقِيماً,As for those who believe in God and hold fast to Him He will surely admit them to mercy from Him and bounty and He will guide them to Him by a straight path namely the religion of Islam.
يَسْتَفْتُونَكَ قُلِ ٱللَّهُ يُفْتِيكُمْ فِي ٱلْكَلاَلَةِ إِن ٱمْرُؤٌ هَلَكَ لَيْسَ لَهُ وَلَدٌ وَلَهُ أُخْتٌ فَلَهَا نِصْفُ مَا تَرَكَ وَهُوَ يَرِثُهَآ إِن لَّمْ يَكُنْ لَّهَآ وَلَدٌ فَإِن كَانَتَا ٱثْنَتَيْنِ فَلَهُمَا ٱلثُّلُثَانِ مِمَّا تَرَكَ وَإِن كَانُوۤاْ إِخْوَةً رِّجَالاً وَنِسَآءً فَلِلذَّكَرِ مِثْلُ حَظِّ ٱلأُنثَيَيْنِ يُبَيِّنُ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمْ أَن تَضِلُّواْ وَٱللَّهُ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عَلِيمٌ,They will ask you for a pronouncement concerning indirect heirs. Say ‘God pronounces to you concerning indirect heirs. If a man in imru’un is in the nominative because of the verb halaka ‘perishes’ that explains it perishes dies having no children and no parent and this is the one referred to as an indirect heir kalāla but he has a sister from both parents or from one hers is half of what he leaves and he a brother similarly is her heir in all that she leaves if she has no children but if she has a son then he the maternal uncle receives nothing and if a daughter then whatever is left after her share; if the brother and sister be from the same mother then the one receives a sixth as was stipulated at the beginning of the sūra Q. 411. If there be two sisters or more — for this was revealed regarding Jābir b. ‘Abd Allāh who died and was survived by sisters — theirs are two-thirds of what he the brother leaves; if there be among the inheritors siblings men and women then the male among them shall receive the equivalent of the portion of two females. God makes clear to you the stipulations of your religion lest you go astray; and God has knowledge of all things’ including matters of inheritance it is reported by the two Shaykhs Bukhārī and Muslim that al-Barā’ b. ‘Āzib said that this was the last of the ‘duty’ verses to be revealed.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ أَوْفُواْ بِٱلْعُقُودِ أُحِلَّتْ لَكُمْ بَهِيمَةُ ٱلأَنْعَامِ إِلاَّ مَا يُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْكُمْ غَيْرَ مُحِلِّي ٱلصَّيْدِ وَأَنْتُمْ حُرُمٌ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَحْكُمُ مَا يُرِيدُ,O you who believe fulfil your bonds the covenants confirmed between you and God and between you and other people. Lawful to you is the beast of the flocks camels cattle and sheep and goats to eat after slaughtering them except that which is now being recited to you as forbidden in the verse below Forbidden to you are carrion…Q. 53; the exceptive clause here is a discontinuous one but may also be continuous; the forbidding concerns that which has succumbed to death and the like; game not being lawful to you when you are on pilgrimage hurum means muhrimūn; ghayra ‘not’ is in the accusative as it introduces a circumstantial qualifier referring to the subject of the pronoun lakum ‘to you’. Verily God decrees whatever He desires in the way of making things lawful or otherwise and there can be no objection thereto.
يَا أَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ لاَ تُحِلُّواْ شَعَآئِرَ ٱللَّهِ وَلاَ ٱلشَّهْرَ ٱلْحَرَامَ وَلاَ ٱلْهَدْيَ وَلاَ ٱلْقَلاۤئِدَ وَلاۤ آمِّينَ ٱلْبَيْتَ ٱلْحَرَامَ يَبْتَغُونَ فَضْلاً مِّن رَّبِّهِمْ وَرِضْوَاناً وَإِذَا حَلَلْتُمْ فَٱصْطَادُواْ وَلاَ يَجْرِمَنَّكُمْ شَنَآنُ قَوْمٍ أَن صَدُّوكُمْ عَنِ ٱلْمَسْجِدِ ٱلْحَرَامِ أَن تَعْتَدُواْ وَتَعَاوَنُواْ عَلَى ٱلْبرِّ وَٱلتَّقْوَىٰ وَلاَ تَعَاوَنُواْ عَلَى ٱلإِثْمِ وَٱلْعُدْوَانِ وَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ شَدِيدُ ٱلْعِقَابِ,O you who believe do not profane God’s sacraments sha‘ā’ir is the plural of sha‘īra that is the ritual ceremonies of the religion by hunting game while you are on pilgrimage nor the sacred month by fighting in it nor the offering that is the boon offered in the Meccan Sanctuary by interfering with it nor the garlands qalā’id is the plural of qilāda and these made from the trees around the Sanctuary were placed around it the offering to protect it in other words do not interfere with these offerings or with those who place them; nor violate the sanctity of those repairing those heading to the Sacred House by fighting them who are seeking bounty provision from their Lord through commerce and His beatitude by resorting to Him as they the Meccans pagans falsely claimed this was abrogated by the barā’a verse of sūrat al-Tawba Q. 94. But when you are discharged from pilgrimage inviolability then hunt for game a command denoting permission. And let not hatred read shana’ānu or shan’ānu of a people that because they barred you from the Sacred Mosque cause you to commit aggression against them by killing them or otherwise. Help one another to righteousness by doing that to which you were enjoined and piety by refraining from what you have been forbidden; do not help one another ta‘āwanū one of the two original tā’ letters in tata‘āwanū has been omitted to sin acts of disobedience and enmity transgression of God’s bounds. And fear God fear His punishment by being obedient to Him; surely God is severe in retribution against those that oppose Him.
حُرِّمَتْ عَلَيْكُمُ ٱلْمَيْتَةُ وَٱلْدَّمُ وَلَحْمُ ٱلْخِنْزِيرِ وَمَآ أُهِلَّ لِغَيْرِ ٱللَّهِ بِهِ وَٱلْمُنْخَنِقَةُ وَٱلْمَوْقُوذَةُ وَٱلْمُتَرَدِّيَةُ وَٱلنَّطِيحَةُ وَمَآ أَكَلَ ٱلسَّبُعُ إِلاَّ مَا ذَكَّيْتُمْ وَمَا ذُبِحَ عَلَى ٱلنُّصُبِ وَأَنْ تَسْتَقْسِمُواْ بِٱلأَزْلاَمِ ذٰلِكُمْ فِسْقٌ ٱلْيَوْمَ يَئِسَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِن دِينِكُمْ فَلاَ تَخْشَوْهُمْ وَٱخْشَوْنِ ٱلْيَوْمَ أَكْمَلْتُ لَكُمْ دِينَكُمْ وَأَتْمَمْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ نِعْمَتِي وَرَضِيتُ لَكُمُ ٱلإِسْلٰمَ دِيناً فَمَنِ ٱضْطُرَّ فِي مَخْمَصَةٍ غَيْرَ مُتَجَانِفٍ لإِثْمٍ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,Forbidden to you is carrion that is the consumption of it and blood that is what has been spilt as mentioned in sūrat al-An‘ām Q. 6145 and the flesh of swine and what has been hallowed to other than God in that it was sacrificed in the name of something other than Him and the beast strangled to death and the beast beaten down to death and the beast fallen from a height to its death and the beast gored to death by another and what beasts of prey have devoured of such animals — except for what you have sacrificed duly catching it while it still breathes life and then sacrificing it — and what has been sacrificed in the name of idols nusub is the plural of nusāb and that you apportion that is that you demand an oath or a ruling through the divining of arrows azlām the plural of zalam or zulam which is a qidh ‘a small arrow’ without feathers or a head. There were seven of these arrows marked with flags and they were retained by the keeper of the Ka‘ba. They would use them for abitrations and when they commanded them they obeyed and if they prohibited them they would desist; that is wickedness a rebellion against obedience. And on the Day of ‘Arafa in the year of the Farewell Pilgrimage the following was revealed Today the disbelievers have despaired of your religion of you apostatising from it having hoped for it earlier for now they perceived its strength; therefore do not fear them but fear Me. Today I have perfected your religion for you that is its rulings and obligations after this verse nothing about what is lawful or unlawful was revealed and I have completed My favour upon you by perfecting it your religion but it is also said by effecting their safe entry into Mecca; and I have approved chosen Islam for you as religion. But whoever is constrained by emptiness by hunger to consume some of what has been forbidden him and consumes it not inclining purposely to sin to an act of disobedience — then God is Forgiving to him for what he has consumed Merciful to him by permitting it to him in contrast to the one who purposely inclines to sin that is the one actively engaged in it such as a waylayer or a criminal for whom such consumption is forbidden.
يَسْأَلُونَكَ مَاذَآ أُحِلَّ لَهُمْ قُلْ أُحِلَّ لَكُمُ ٱلطَّيِّبَاتُ وَمَا عَلَّمْتُمْ مِّنَ ٱلْجَوَارِحِ مُكَلِّبِينَ تُعَلِّمُونَهُنَّ مِمَّا عَلَّمَكُمُ ٱللَّهُ فَكُلُواْ مِمَّآ أَمْسَكْنَ عَلَيْكُمْ وَٱذْكُرُواْ ٱسْمَ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْهِ وَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ سَرِيعُ ٱلْحِسَابِ,They will ask you O Muhammad (s) about what food is made lawful for them. Say ‘The good delicious things are made lawful for you; and the quarry of hunting creatures dogs wildcats or birds that catch food you have taught training them as hounds mukallibīn is a circumstantial qualifier derived from kallabtu al-kalba meaning ‘I released the hound against the quarry’ teaching them tu‘allimūnahunna is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the subject of mukallibīn ‘training them as hounds’ in other words ‘disciplining them’ of what God has taught you of the art of hunting; so eat what they have caught for you even if they have killed it as long as they have not eaten any of it. This is in contrast to the untrained hunting creatures whose catch is not lawful for consumption the mark of these being trained hunting creatures is that they should return after they have been sent out that they can be curbed when cried at and that they can seize the quarry without eating of it; the minimum number of times by which this may be known is three. If they eat any of it then it cannot be counted as ‘what they have caught’ for their trainers and is consequently unlawful for consumption as reported in hadīth in both of the Sahīhs of Bukhārī and Muslim — therein it is also mentioned that a catch made by an arrow over which God’s name is mentioned is equivalent in lawfulness to the catch of trained hunting creatures. And mention God’s name over it when you unleash it. And fear God. Indeed God is swift at the reckoning’.
ٱلْيَوْمَ أُحِلَّ لَكُمُ ٱلطَّيّبَـٰتُ وَطَعَامُ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ ٱلْكِتَـٰبَ حِلٌّ لَّكُمْ وَطَعَامُكُمْ حِلٌّ لَّهُمْ وَٱلْمُحْصَنَـٰتُ مِنَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنَـٰتِ وَٱلْمُحْصَنَـٰتُ مِنَ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ ٱلْكِتَـٰبَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ إِذَا ءاتَيْتُمُوهُنَّ أُجُورَهُنَّ مُحْصِنِينَ غَيْرَ مُسَٰفِحِينَ وَلاَ مُتَّخِذِيۤ أَخْدَانٍ وَمَن يَكْفُرْ بِٱلإِيمَٰنِ فَقَدْ حَبِطَ عَمَلُهُ وَهُوَ فِي ٱلآخِرَةِ مِنَ ٱلْخَٰسِرِينَ,Today the good the delicious things are permitted to you and the food of those who were given the Scripture that is animals slaughtered by the Jews and Christians is permitted to you and permitted to them is your food. Likewise the believing free married women and the married women of those who were given the Scripture before you are permitted to you for marriage if you give them their wages their dowries in wedlock in marriage and not illicitly fornicating overtly with them or taking them as lovers so as to fornicate with them secretly. Whoever disbelieves in faith that is whose apostatises his prior good work has indeed failed and so it counts for nothing and he will not be rewarded for it and in the Hereafter he shall be among the losers if he dies in this state of unbelief.
يَا أَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ إِذَا قُمْتُمْ إِلَى ٱلصَّلاةِ فٱغْسِلُواْ وُجُوهَكُمْ وَأَيْدِيَكُمْ إِلَى ٱلْمَرَافِقِ وَٱمْسَحُواْ بِرُؤُوسِكُمْ وَأَرْجُلَكُمْ إِلَى ٱلْكَعْبَينِ وَإِن كُنتُمْ جُنُباً فَٱطَّهَّرُواْ وَإِن كُنتُم مَّرْضَىۤ أَوْ عَلَىٰ سَفَرٍ أَوْ جَآءَ أَحَدٌ مِّنْكُمْ مِّنَ ٱلْغَائِطِ أَوْ لاَمَسْتُمُ ٱلنِّسَآءَ فَلَمْ تَجِدُواْ مَآءً فَتَيَمَّمُواْ صَعِيداً طَيِّباً فَٱمْسَحُواْ بِوُجُوهِكُمْ وَأَيْدِيكُمْ مِّنْهُ مَا يُرِيدُ ٱللَّهُ لِيَجْعَلَ عَلَيْكُم مِّنْ حَرَجٍ وَلَـٰكِن يُرِيدُ لِيُطَهِّرَكُمْ وَلِيُتِمَّ نِعْمَتَهُ عَلَيْكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ,O you who believe when you stand up that is when you intend to go to pray and you are in a state of ritual impurity wash your faces and your hands up to the elbows that is including them the elbows as is clarified in the Sunna; and wipe your heads the bā’ in bi-ru’ūsikum is for ‘adherence’ that is to say wipe over the head adhering the hand closely without excessive water pouring over; the noun ra’s ‘head’ is generic and so the minimum required to fulfil the stipulation is acceptable which is the wiping of some of the hair as al-Shāfi‘ī asserts; and your feet read wa-arjulakum in the accusative as a supplement to aydīyakum; or wa-arjulikum in the genitive because of its adjacency to the genitive bi-ru’ūsikum up to the ankles that is including them the ankles as is clarified in the Sunna and they are the two protruding bones at the juncture of the legs and the feet. The interposing of the wiping of the head between the mention of the hands and the feet which are washed is intended to show the requirement of a specific order during the purification of these limbs as al-Shāfi‘ī asserts. In addition the requirement of making intention niyya in this ablution as in the other rituals of worship is taken from the Sunna. If you are defiled purify wash yourselves; but if you are sick with an illness made worse by water or on a journey travelling or if any of you comes from the privy that is if he has defecated or you have touched women as mentioned already in the verse in sūrat al-Nisā’ Q. 443 and you cannot find water having made the effort to look for it then head for seek wholesome dust that is clean earth and wipe your faces and your hands including the elbows with it using two strikes the bā’ of bi-wujūhikum ‘your faces’ denotes ‘adherence’; it is explained in the Sunna that the requirement here is for the wiping to encompass the whole of these two parts. God does not desire to make any hardship for you any constraint in the obligations He has imposed on you with regard to ablution washing and purification with dust; but He desires to purify you of filth and sins and that He may perfect His grace upon you through Islam by explaining the laws of the religion; so that you might give thanks for His graces.
وَٱذْكُرُواْ نِعْمَةَ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ وَمِيثَاقَهُ ٱلَّذِي وَاثَقَكُم بِهِ إِذْ قُلْتُمْ سَمِعْنَا وَأَطَعْنَا وَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلِيمٌ بِذَاتِ ٱلصُّدُورِ,And remember God’s grace upon you through Islam and His covenant His pledge which He made He bound with you when you said to the Prophet s upon pledging allegiance to him ‘We hear and we obey’ all that you command and forbid of what we love and what we despise. And fear God in His covenant lest you break it. Surely God knows what is in the breasts that is what is in the hearts of people all the more reason for Him to have knowledge of other things.
يَا أَيُّهَآ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ كُونُواْ قَوَّامِينَ للَّهِ شُهَدَآءَ بِٱلْقِسْطِ وَلاَ يَجْرِمَنَّكُمْ شَنَآنُ قَوْمٍ عَلَىۤ أَلاَّ تَعْدِلُواْ ٱعْدِلُواْ هُوَ أَقْرَبُ لِلتَّقْوَىٰ وَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ خَبِيرٌ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ,O you who believe be upright before God in fulfilling what is His due witnesses in equity in justice. Let not hatred of a people namely the disbelievers cause you not to be just and to harm them on account of their enmity; be just towards both friend and foe that justice is nearer to God-fearing. And fear God; surely God is aware of what you do and will requite you for it.
وَعَدَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ لَهُم مَّغْفِرَةٌ وَأَجْرٌ عَظِيمٌ,God has promised those who believe and perform righteous deeds an excellent promise they shall have forgiveness and a great wage that is Paradise.
وَٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَكَذَّبُواْ بِآيَاتِنَآ أُوْلَـۤئِكَ أَصْحَابُ ٱلْجَحِيمِ,And they who disbelieve and deny Our signs — they shall be the inhabitants of Hell-fire.
يَا أَيُّهَآ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ ٱذْكُرُواْ نِعْمَتَ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ إِذْ هَمَّ قَوْمٌ أَن يَبْسُطُواْ إِلَيْكُمْ أَيْدِيَهُمْ فَكَفَّ أَيْدِيَهُمْ عَنكُمْ وَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَعَلَى ٱللَّهِ فَلْيَتَوَكَّلِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ,O you who believe remember God’s favour upon you when a people namely Quraysh purposed to extend their hands against you in order to attack you but He restrained their hands from you and protected you from what they intended to do to you; and fear God; and in God let the believers put their trust.
وَلَقَدْ أَخَذَ ٱللَّهُ مِيثَاقَ بَنِيۤ إِسْرَآئِيلَ وَبَعَثْنَا مِنهُمُ ٱثْنَيْ عَشَرَ نَقِيباً وَقَالَ ٱللَّهُ إِنِّي مَعَكُمْ لَئِنْ أَقَمْتُمُ ٱلصَّلاَةَ وَآتَيْتُمُ ٱلزَّكَاةَ وَآمَنتُمْ بِرُسُلِي وَعَزَّرْتُمُوهُمْ وَأَقْرَضْتُمُ ٱللَّهَ قَرْضاً حَسَناً لأُكَفِّرَنَّ عَنْكُمْ سَيِّئَاتِكُمْ وَلأُدْخِلَنَّكُمْ جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلأَنْهَارُ فَمَن كَفَرَ بَعْدَ ذٰلِكَ مِنْكُمْ فَقَدْ ضَلَّ سَوَآءَ ٱلسَّبِيلِ,God had made a covenant with the Children of Israel for what will be mentioned shortly and We raised up there is a shift of address away from the third to the first person from among them twelve leaders from each tribe one leader to be responsible for his people’s fulfilment of the covenant as a way of binding them to it. And God said to them ‘I am with you helping and assisting. Surely if la-in the lām is for oaths you establish the prayer and pay the alms and believe in My messengers and succour them help them and lend to God a goodly loan by expending in His way I will absolve you of your evil deeds and I will admit you to gardens underneath which rivers flow. So whoever of you disbelieves after that covenant surely he has strayed from the right way’ he has erred from the path to Paradise al-sawā’ originally means ‘the middle way’. And they broke the covenant.
فَبِمَا نَقْضِهِم مِّيثَاقَهُمْ لَعنَّاهُمْ وَجَعَلْنَا قُلُوبَهُمْ قَاسِيَةً يُحَرِّفُونَ ٱلْكَلِمَ عَن مَّوَاضِعِهِ وَنَسُواْ حَظًّا مِّمَّا ذُكِرُواْ بِهِ وَلاَ تَزَالُ تَطَّلِعُ عَلَىٰ خَآئِنَةٍ مِّنْهُمْ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً مِّنْهُمُ فَٱعْفُ عَنْهُمْ وَٱصْفَحْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُحِبُّ ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,God says So because bi-mā the mā is extra of their breaking their covenant We cursed them We removed them from Our mercy and made their hearts hard unyielding to the acceptance of faith; they pervert words pertaining to the descriptions of Muhammad (s) in the Torah and other things from their contexts those in which God has placed them in other words they substitute them; and they have forgotten they have abandoned a portion a part of what they were reminded of of what they were enjoined to in the Torah in the way of following Muhammad (s); and you — addressing the Prophet s now — will never cease to discover some treachery on their part in the way of breaking a covenant or some other matter except for a few of them who have submitted themselves to Islam. Yet pardon them and forgive; surely God loves the virtuous this was abrogated by the ‘sword’ verse Q. 95.
وَمِنَ ٱلَّذِينَ قَالُواْ إِنَّا نَصَارَىٰ أَخَذْنَا مِيثَاقَهُمْ فَنَسُواْ حَظّاً مِّمَّا ذُكِرُواْ بِهِ فَأَغْرَيْنَا بَيْنَهُمُ ٱلْعَدَاوَةَ وَٱلْبَغْضَآءَ إِلَىٰ يَوْمِ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ وَسَوْفَ يُنَبِّئُهُمُ ٱللَّهُ بِمَا كَانُواْ يَصْنَعُونَ,And with those who say ‘We are Christians’ this is semantically connected to what follows We made a covenant just as We did with the Children of Israel the Jews and they have forgotten a portion of that they were reminded of in the Gospel pertaining to faith and other matters and they too broke the covenant. So We have stirred up We have caused among them enmity and hatred until the Day of Resurrection on account of their schisms and differing whims each sect charging the other with unbelief; and God will assuredly tell them in the Hereafter of what they wrought and requite them for this.
يَا أَهْلَ ٱلْكِتَابِ قَدْ جَآءَكُمْ رَسُولُنَا يُبَيِّنُ لَكُمْ كَثِيراً مِّمَّا كُنْتُمْ تُخْفُونَ مِنَ ٱلْكِتَابِ وَيَعْفُواْ عَن كَثِيرٍ قَدْ جَآءَكُمْ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ نُورٌ وَكِتَابٌ مُّبِينٌ,O People of the Scripture Jews and Christians now there has come to you Our Messenger Muhammad (s) making clear to you much of what you used to conceal of the Scripture the Torah and the Gospel such as the ‘stoning’ verse and the description of the Prophet Muhammad (s) and pardoning much of it which he does not reveal since this would not be of any benefit serving only to disgrace you. There has verily come to you from God a light namely the Prophet s and a Book a Qur’ān lucid plain and manifest
يَهْدِي بِهِ ٱللَّهُ مَنِ ٱتَّبَعَ رِضْوَانَهُ سُبُلَ ٱلسَّلاَمِ وَيُخْرِجُهُمْ مِّنِ ٱلظُّلُمَاتِ إِلَى ٱلنُّورِ بِإِذْنِهِ وَيَهْدِيهِمْ إِلَىٰ صِرَاطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ,whereby that is the Book by which God guides whoever follows His good pleasure by believing to the ways of peace the paths of safety and brings them forth from the shadows from unbelief into the light into belief by His leave by His will and He guides them to a straight path the religion of Islam.
لَّقَدْ كَفَرَ ٱلَّذِينَ قَآلُوۤاْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ هُوَ ٱلْمَسِيحُ ٱبْنُ مَرْيَمَ قُلْ فَمَن يَمْلِكُ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ شَيْئاً إِنْ أَرَادَ أَن يُهْلِكَ ٱلْمَسِيحَ ٱبْنَ مَرْيَمَ وَأُمَّهُ وَمَن فِي ٱلأَرْضِ جَمِيعاً وَللَّهِ مُلْكُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا يَخْلُقُ مَا يَشَآءُ وَٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,They indeed are disbelievers those who say ‘God is the Messiah son of Mary’ insofar as they make him Jesus a god and these were the Jacobites a Christian sect. Say ‘Who then can do anything who then can defend against the chastisement of God if He desires to destroy the Messiah son of Mary and his mother and all those who are on earth?’ that is to say none can do anything of the sort since if Jesus were a god he would be able to do so. And to God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them. He creates what He will. God has power over everything which He wills.
وَقَالَتِ ٱلْيَهُودُ وَٱلنَّصَٰرَىٰ نَحْنُ أَبْنَٰؤُاْ ٱللَّهِ وَأَحِبَّٰؤُهُ قُلْ فَلِمَ يُعَذِّبُكُم بِذُنُوبِكُم بَلْ أَنتُمْ بَشَرٌ مِمَّنْ خَلَقَ يَغْفِرُ لِمَن يَشَآءُ وَيُعَذِّبُ مَن يَشَآءُ وَللَّهِ مُلْكُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا وَإِلَيْهِ ٱلْمَصِيرُ,The Jews and Christians both of them say ‘We are the sons of God that is we are like his sons in terms of closeness and rank and He is like a father to us in terms of compassion and care and His beloved ones’. Say to them O Muhammad (s) ‘Why then does He chastise you for your sins? if what you say is true. For the father does not punish his son nor the loving his beloved; but He has punished you and therefore you are saying lies. Nay; you are mortals from among all those mortals He created you shall be rewarded as they are rewarded and you shall be requited as they are requited. He forgives him for whom He wills forgiveness and He chastises him for whom He wills’ chastisement and there can be no objection thereto. For to God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth and all that is between them; to Him is the journey’s end the final return.
يَا أَهْلَ ٱلْكِتَابِ قَدْ جَآءَكُمْ رَسُولُنَا يُبَيِّنُ لَكُمْ عَلَىٰ فَتْرَةٍ مِّنَ ٱلرُّسُلِ أَن تَقُولُواْ مَا جَآءَنَا مِن بَشِيرٍ وَلاَ نَذِيرٍ فَقَدْ جَاءَكُمْ بَشِيرٌ وَنَذِيرٌ وَٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,O People of the Scripture there has verily come to you Our Messenger Muhammad (s) making clear to you the laws of religion after an interval between the messengers for there was no messenger between him and Jesus an interval of 569 years; lest you should say if you are punished ‘There has not come to us any bearer of good tidings min bashīr the min is extra nor any warner’. Indeed there has come to you a bearer of good tidings and a warner and so you shall have no excuse. God has power over all things including punishing you for not following him the Messenger.
وَإِذْ قَالَ مُوسَىٰ لِقَوْمِهِ يَاقَوْمِ ٱذْكُرُواْ نِعْمَةَ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ إِذْ جَعَلَ فِيكُمْ أَنْبِيَآءَ وَجَعَلَكُمْ مُّلُوكاً وَآتَاكُمْ مَّا لَمْ يُؤْتِ أَحَداً مِّن ٱلْعَٱلَمِينَ,And mention when Moses said to his people ‘O my people remember God’s favour to you when He established among you that is from among you prophets and established you as kings possessing servants and retinues and gave you such as He had not given to any in all the worlds in the way of manna and quails the parting of the sea and other things.
يَٰقَوْمِ ٱدْخُلُوا ٱلأَرْضَ ٱلمُقَدَّسَةَ ٱلَّتِي كَتَبَ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمْ وَلاَ تَرْتَدُّوا عَلَىٰ أَدْبَارِكُمْ فَتَنْقَلِبُوا خَٰسِرِينَ,O my people enter the Holy the purified Land which God has ordained for you which He commanded you to enter and this is Syria al-shām and do not turn back in flight do not retreat in fear of the enemy or you will end up as losers’ in your efforts.
قَالُوا يَامُوسَىٰ إِنَّ فِيهَا قَوْماً جَبَّارِينَ وَإِنَّا لَن نَّدْخُلَهَا حَتَّىٰ يَخْرُجُواْ مِنْهَا فَإِن يَخْرُجُواْ مِنْهَا فَإِنَّا دَاخِلُونَ,They said ‘O Moses there are giants in it those remaining of the people of ‘Ād who were very tall and mighty; we will never enter it until they depart from it; if they depart from it then we will enter’ it.
قَالَ رَجُلاَنِ مِنَ ٱلَّذِينَ يَخَافُونَ أَنْعَمَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْهِمَا ٱدْخُلُواْ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلْبَابَ فَإِذَا دَخَلْتُمُوهُ فَإِنَّكُمْ غَالِبُونَ وَعَلَى ٱللَّهِ فَتَوَكَّلُوۤاْ إِن كُنتُم مُّؤْمِنِينَ,There said to them two men of those who feared contravening God’s command and these were Joshua and Caleb — who were from among the leaders that Moses dispatched to bring back news of those giants — to whom God had been gracious by making them virtuous for they concealed what they had discovered about the giants telling only Moses unlike the other leaders who divulged the news and so the people became cowardly. ‘Enter against them by the gate! the gate of the town and have no fear of them for they are bodies without hearts. For if you enter by it you will be victorious the two Joshua and Caleb said this because they were certain of God’s assistance and the fulfilment of His promise. Put your trust in God if you are believers’.
قَالُواْ يَامُوسَىۤ إِنَّا لَنْ نَّدْخُلَهَآ أَبَداً مَّا دَامُواْ فِيهَا فَٱذْهَبْ أَنتَ وَرَبُّكَ فَقَاتِلاۤ إِنَّا هَاهُنَا قَاعِدُونَ,They said ‘O Moses we will never enter it so long as they are in it. So go forth you and your Lord and fight them we will be sitting here’ away from the fighting.
قَالَ رَبِّ إِنِّي لاۤ أَمْلِكُ إِلاَّ نَفْسِي وَأَخِي فَٱفْرُقْ بَيْنَنَا وَبَيْنَ ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلْفَاسِقِينَ,He Moses thereupon said ‘My Lord I control none but myself and my brother and I control no one else to be able to force them to obedience. So separate distinguish us from the wicked folk’.
قَالَ فَإِنَّهَا مُحَرَّمَةٌ عَلَيْهِمْ أَرْبَعِينَ سَنَةً يَتِيهُونَ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ فَلاَ تَأْسَ عَلَى ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلْفَاسِقِينَ,He God exalted be He said to him ‘Then it the Holy Land shall be forbidden them to enter for forty years; they shall wander lost bewildered in the land — according to Ibn ‘Abbās this land was about nine parasangs sc. 30 miles; so do not grieve for the wicked folk’. It is reported that they would travel throughout the night earnestly but in the morning would find themselves back where they had started. And they would travel all day with the same result until they all perished except those under twenty years of age. It is said that they numbered 600000. Moses and Aaron died in the wilderness and this was a mercy for them and a chastisement for those others. When Moses was on the verge of death he asked his Lord to bring him close to the Holy Land to within a stone’s throw and He did as related in hadīth. Joshua became a prophet sometime after his fortieth year and he was commanded to fight against the giants. So he sallied forth with those that remained by his side and he fought against them; it was a Friday and the sun stopped for him for an hour until he had finished with fighting them. Ahmad b. Hanbal reported in his Musnad the following hadīth ‘The sun was never detained for any human except for Joshua during those days in which he marched towards the Holy House of Jerusalem’.
وَٱتْلُ عَلَيْهِمْ نَبَأَ ٱبْنَيْ ءَادَمَ بِٱلْحَقِّ إِذْ قَرَّبَا قُرْبَاناً فَتُقُبِّلَ مِن أَحَدِهِمَا وَلَمْ يُتَقَبَّلْ مِنَ ٱلآخَرِ قَالَ لأَقْتُلَنَّكَ قَالَ إِنَّمَا يَتَقَبَّلُ ٱللَّهُ مِنَ ٱلْمُتَّقِينَ,And recite O Muhammad (s) to them your people the story the tale of the two sons of Adam Abel and Cain truthfully bi’l-haqq is semantically connected to utlu ‘recite’ how they each offered a sacrifice to God which in Abel’s case was a ram and in Cain’s some green crops and it was accepted from one of them namely from Abel when a fire came down from the heaven and consumed his offering and not accepted from the other that is from Cain and so he became furious and kept secret his envy until Adam left on pilgrimage. He said to him ‘I will surely slay you’ and the other said ‘Why?’ to which the first replied ‘Because only your offering was accepted’. The other said ‘God accepts only from the God-fearing’.
لَئِن بَسَطتَ إِلَيَّ يَدَكَ لِتَقْتُلَنِي مَآ أَنَاْ بِبَاسِطٍ يَدِيَ إِلَيْكَ لأَقْتُلَكَ إِنِّيۤ أَخَافُ ٱللَّهَ رَبَّ ٱلْعَالَمِينَ,‘Yet if la-in the lām is for oaths you extend your hand against me to slay me I will not extend my hand against you to slay you; I fear God the Lord of the Worlds in slaying you.
إِنِّيۤ أُرِيدُ أَن تَبُوءَ بِإِثْمِي وَإِثْمِكَ فَتَكُونَ مِنْ أَصْحَابِ ٱلنَّارِ وَذَلِكَ جَزَآءُ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ,I desire that you should end up with my sin the sin of slaying me and your own sin the one that you had committed before and so become an inhabitant of the Fire whereas I do not want to end up with your sin if I were to slay you and become one of them. God exalted be He says that is the requital of the evildoers’.
فَطَوَّعَتْ لَهُ نَفْسُهُ قَتْلَ أَخِيهِ فَقَتَلَهُ فَأَصْبَحَ مِنَ ٱلْخَاسِرِينَ,Then his soul prompted him it seduced him to slay his brother so he slew him and became one of the losers by slaying him. And he did not know what to do with him because he was the first of the Children of Adam to die on earth and so he carried him on his back.
فَبَعَثَ ٱللَّهُ غُرَاباً يَبْحَثُ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ لِيُرِيَهُ كَيْفَ يُوَارِي سَوْءَةَ أَخِيهِ قَالَ يَاوَيْلَتَا أَعَجَزْتُ أَنْ أَكُونَ مِثْلَ هَـٰذَا ٱلْغُرَابِ فَأُوَارِيَ سَوْءَةَ أَخِي فَأَصْبَحَ مِنَ ٱلنَّادِمِينَ,Then God sent forth a raven scratching into the earth digging up the soil with its beak and with its legs and throwing it up over a dead raven next to it until it completely hid it to show him how he might hide the nakedness the carcass of his brother. He said ‘Woe to me! Am I not able to be as this raven and so hide my brother’s nakedness?’ And he became one of the remorseful for having carried him; he then dug a hole for him and covered him up.
مِنْ أَجْلِ ذٰلِكَ كَتَبْنَا عَلَىٰ بَنِيۤ إِسْرَائِيلَ أَنَّهُ مَن قَتَلَ نَفْساً بِغَيْرِ نَفْسٍ أَوْ فَسَادٍ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ فَكَأَنَّمَا قَتَلَ ٱلنَّاسَ جَمِيعاً وَمَنْ أَحْيَاهَا فَكَأَنَّمَا أَحْيَا النَّاسَ جَمِيعاً وَلَقَدْ جَآءَتْهُمْ رُسُلُنَا بِٱلّبَيِّنَٰتِ ثُمَّ إِنَّ كَثِيراً مِّنْهُمْ بَعْدَ ذٰلِكَ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ لَمُسْرِفُونَ,Because of that which Cain did We decreed for the Children of Israel that whoever slays a soul for other than a soul slain or for other than corruption committed in the land in the way of unbelief fornication or waylaying and the like it shall be as if he had slain mankind altogether; and whoever saves the life of one by refraining from slaying it shall be as if he had saved the life of all mankind — Ibn ‘Abbās said that the above is meant in the sense of violating and protecting its a soul’s sanctity respectively. Our messengers have already come to them that is to the Children of Israel with clear proofs miracles but after that many of them still commit excesses in the land overstepping the bounds through disbelief killing and the like.
إِنَّمَا جَزَآءُ ٱلَّذِينَ يُحَارِبُونَ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ وَيَسْعَوْنَ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ فَسَاداً أَن يُقَتَّلُوۤاْ أَوْ يُصَلَّبُوۤاْ أَوْ تُقَطَّعَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَأَرْجُلُهُم مِّنْ خِلافٍ أَوْ يُنفَوْاْ مِنَ ٱلأَرْضِ ذٰلِكَ لَهُمْ خِزْيٌ فِي ٱلدُّنْيَا وَلَهُمْ فِي ٱلآخِرَةِ عَذَابٌ عَظِيمٌ,The following was revealed when the ‘Arniyyūn came to Medina suffering from some illness and the Prophet s gave them permission to go and drink from the camels’ urine and milk. Once they felt well they slew the Prophet’s shepherd and stole the herd of camels Truly the only requital of those who fight against God and His Messenger by fighting against Muslims and hasten about the earth to do corruption there by waylaying is that they shall be slaughtered or crucified or have their hands and feet cut off on opposite sides that is their right hands and left feet or be banished from the land the aw ‘or’ is used to indicate the separate application of each of the cases listed; thus death is for those that have only killed; crucifixion is for those that have killed and stolen property; the cutting off of limbs on opposite sides is for those that have stolen property but have not killed; while banishment is for those that pose a threat — this was stated by Ibn ‘Abbās and is the opinion of al-Shāfi‘ī; the more sound of his al-Shāfi‘ī’s two opinions is that crucifixion should be for three days after the death of the killer or it is also said shortly before he is killed; with banishment are included similar punishments such as imprisonment and the like. That mentioned requital is a degradation a humiliation for them in this world; and in the Hereafter theirs will be a great chastisement namely the chastisement of the Fire.
إِلاَّ ٱلَّذِينَ تَابُواْ مِن قَبْلِ أَن تَقْدِرُواْ عَلَيْهِمْ فَٱعْلَمُواْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,Except for such warmongers and waylayers as repent before you overpower them; for know that God is Forgiving to them of what they have done Merciful to them. This proviso is expressed without any statement to the effect ‘do not submit them to prescribed legal punishment’ to point out that when such a person repents only God’s prescribed punishments hudūd — and not those deriving from the rights of human beings — are waived. This is how I see it. I do not know of any that have tackled this topic and God knows best. If then a person has killed and stolen property he should be killed and have his limbs cut off on opposite sides but not crucified — this is the more sound of two opinions held by al-Shāfi‘ī. However his repentance is of no avail once he has been overpowered by the authorities — this is also the more sound of two opinions held by him.
يَا أَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ ٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَٱبْتَغُوۤاْ إِلَيهِ ٱلْوَسِيلَةَ وَجَاهِدُواْ فِي سَبِيلِهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ,O you who believe fear God fear His chastisement by being obedient to Him and seek the means to Him that obedience which brings you closer to Him and struggle in His way in order to elevate His religion; so that you might prosper triumph.
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لَوْ أَنَّ لَهُمْ مَّا فِي ٱلأَرْضِ جَمِيعاً وَمِثْلَهُ مَعَهُ لِيَفْتَدُواْ بِهِ مِنْ عَذَابِ يَوْمِ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ مَا تُقُبِّلَ مِنْهُمْ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,Truly as for the disbelievers if they possessed definitely all that is in the earth and the like of it with it by which to ransom themselves from the chastisement of the Day of Resurrection it would not be accepted from them; theirs shall be a painful chastisement.
يُرِيدُونَ أَن يَخْرُجُواْ مِنَ ٱلنَّارِ وَمَا هُم بِخَارِجِينَ مِنْهَا وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ مُّقِيمٌ,They will desire they will wish to exit from the Fire but they will not exit from it; theirs shall be a lasting a perpetual chastisement.
وَٱلسَّارِقُ وَٱلسَّارِقَةُ فَٱقْطَعُوۤاْ أَيْدِيَهُمَا جَزَآءً بِمَا كَسَبَا نَكَالاً مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَٱللَّهُ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ,And the thieving male and the thieving female the definite article in both nouns relates to the subject sc. wa’lladhī saraqa wa’llatī saraqat ‘And the male who thieves and the female who thieves’; because this clause resembles a conditional statement sc. ‘if he thieves if she thieves’ etc. the fā’ has been included in the predicate fa’qta‘ū ‘then cut off’ cut off their hands that is the right hand of each of the two from the wristbone; it is explained in the Sunna that the amputation applies to the stealing of a quarter of a dinar and upwards and if the person were to re-offend the left foot should then be amputated from the ankle and then on subsequent re-offending the left hand is amputated followed by the right foot after which discretionary punishment is applied; as a requital jazā’an is in the accusative because it is a verbal noun for what they have earned and an exemplary punishment for both of them from God; God is Mighty His way will prevail Wise in His creation.
فَمَن تَابَ مِن بَعْدِ ظُلْمِهِ وَأَصْلَحَ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَتُوبُ عَلَيْهِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,But whoever repents after his evildoing refrains from theft and amends his actions God will relent to him. God is indeed Forgiving Merciful in expressing what has been stated. However the rights of the victim to have the penalty of amputation carried out and his property restored are not automatically forgone after repentance. In fact as is clarified in the Sunna only if he is pardoned before being taken to the Imam is the punishment of amputation waived and al-Shāfi‘ī is of this opinion.
أَلَمْ تَعْلَمْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَهُ مُلْكُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ يُعَذِّبُ مَن يَشَآءُ وَيَغْفِرُ لِمَن يَشَآءُ وَٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,Do you not know the interrogative here is meant as an affirmative that to God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth? He chastises him for whom He wills chastisement for and forgives him for whom He wills forgiveness and God has power over all things including chastising and forgiving.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلرَّسُولُ لاَ يَحْزُنكَ ٱلَّذِينَ يُسَارِعُونَ فِي ٱلْكُفْرِ مِنَ ٱلَّذِينَ قَالُوۤاْ آمَنَّا بِأَفْوَاهِهِمْ وَلَمْ تُؤْمِن قُلُوبُهُمْ وَمِنَ ٱلَّذِينَ هَادُواْ سَمَّاعُونَ لِلْكَذِبِ سَمَّاعُونَ لِقَوْمٍ آخَرِينَ لَمْ يَأْتُوكَ يُحَرِّفُونَ ٱلْكَلِمَ مِن بَعْدِ مَوَاضِعِهِ يَقُولُونَ إِنْ أُوتِيتُمْ هَـٰذَا فَخُذُوهُ وَإِن لَّمْ تُؤْتَوْهُ فَٱحْذَرُواْ وَمَن يُرِدِ ٱللَّهُ فِتْنَتَهُ فَلَن تَمْلِكَ لَهُ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ شَيْئاً أُوْلَـٰئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ لَمْ يُرِدِ ٱللَّهُ أَن يُطَهِّرَ قُلُوبَهُمْ لَهُمْ فِي ٱلدُّنْيَا خِزْيٌ وَلَهُمْ فِي ٱلآخِرَةِ عَذَابٌ عَظِيمٌ,O Messenger let them not grieve you the actions of those who vie with one another in disbelief falling headlong into it in other words they who manifest it at every opportunity of min here is explicative such as say with their mouths with their tongues bi-alsinatihim is semantically connected to qālū ‘such as say’ ‘We believe’ but their hearts do not believe and these are the hypocrites; and from among those of Jewry there is a folk who listen to calumny fabricated by their rabbis listening acceptingly listening to you on behalf of some other folk from among the Jews who have not come to you these were the inhabitants of Khaybar among whom two married persons committed adultery but whom they did not want to stone. And so they dispatched men from Qurayza to ask the Prophet s about the ruling concerning the two; perverting words that are in the Torah such as the ‘stoning’ verse from their contexts the contexts in which God had placed them that is to say substituting them saying to the ones they dispatched ‘If you are given this distorted ruling that is flogging which Muhammad (s) has pronounced for you as a ruling then take it accept it; but if you are not given it and he pronounces some other ruling for you then beware!’ of accepting it! Whomever God desires to try to lead astray you cannot avail him anything against God by preventing such a trial. Those are they whose hearts God did not desire to purify of unbelief for had He desired it you would have been able to do something for them; theirs shall be degradation in this world humiliation by being disgraced and subjected to the jizya and in the Hereafter theirs shall be a great chastisement.
سَمَّاعُونَ لِلْكَذِبِ أَكَّالُونَ لِلسُّحْتِ فَإِن جَآءُوكَ فَٱحْكُمْ بَيْنَهُمْ أَوْ أَعْرِضْ عَنْهُمْ وَإِن تُعْرِضْ عَنْهُمْ فَلَن يَضُرُّوكَ شَيْئاً وَإِنْ حَكَمْتَ فَٱحْكُمْ بَيْنَهُمْ بِٱلْقِسْطِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُحِبُّ ٱلْمُقْسِطِينَ,They are listeners to calumny and consumers of unlawful gain read suhut or suht that which is illicit such as bribes. If they come to you to judge between them then judge between them or turn away from them the second option given here was abrogated by His saying So judge between them to the end of the verse Q. 548. Therefore we Muslims are obliged to judge between them if they request arbitration before us — and this is the more sound of al-Shāfi‘ī’s two opinions. If their request for arbitration involves a Muslim however then we are obliged to judge according to the consensus of legal scholars and not just al-Shāfi‘ī; if you turn away from them they cannot harm you at all; and if you judge between them then judge justly between them; God loves the just those that judge fairly meaning that He will reward them.
وَكَيْفَ يُحَكِّمُونَكَ وَعِنْدَهُمُ ٱلتَّوْرَاةُ فِيهَا حُكْمُ ٱللَّهِ ثُمَّ يَتَوَلَّوْنَ مِن بَعْدِ ذٰلِكَ وَمَآ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ بِٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,But how is it that they make you their judge when they have the Torah wherein is God’s judgement of stoning the interrogative here is for provoking amazement in other words they were not seeking thereby by making you their judge to discover the truth but a lighter punishment for them; and then they turn away and then they reject your ruling of stoning which accords with what is in their Scripture after that request to you for arbitration? Such are not believers.
إِنَّآ أَنزَلْنَا ٱلتَّوْرَاةَ فِيهَا هُدًى وَنُورٌ يَحْكُمُ بِهَا ٱلنَّبِيُّونَ ٱلَّذِينَ أَسْلَمُواْ لِلَّذِينَ هَادُواْ وَٱلرَّبَّانِيُّونَ وَٱلأَحْبَارُ بِمَا ٱسْتُحْفِظُواْ مِن كِتَابِ ٱللَّهِ وَكَانُواْ عَلَيْهِ شُهَدَآءَ فَلاَ تَخْشَوُاْ ٱلنَّاسَ وَٱخْشَوْنِ وَلاَ تَشْتَرُواْ بِآيَاتِي ثَمَناً قَلِيلاً وَمَن لَّمْ يَحْكُم بِمَآ أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ فَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْكَافِرُونَ,Surely We revealed the Torah wherein is guidance from error and light that is an exposition of the rulings by which the prophets from the Children of Israel who had submitted who had been compliant before God judged for those of Jewry as did the rabbis the scholars among them and the priests the jurists according to because of that which they were bidden to observe that which was entrusted to them that is to say that which God bid them to observe of God’s Scripture lest they change it and were witnesses to its truth. So do not fear men O Jews in disclosing what you have pertaining to the descriptions of Muhammad (s) the ‘stoning’ verse and otherwise; but fear Me when you conceal it; and do not sell do not exchange My signs for a small price of this world which you take in return for concealing them. Whoever does not judge according to what God has revealed — such are the disbelievers in it.
وَكَتَبْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ فِيهَآ أَنَّ ٱلنَّفْسَ بِٱلنَّفْسِ وَٱلْعَيْنَ بِٱلْعَيْنِ وَٱلأَنْفَ بِٱلأَنْفِ وَٱلأُذُنَ بِٱلأُذُنِ وَٱلسِّنَّ بِٱلسِّنِّ وَٱلْجُرُوحَ قِصَاصٌ فَمَن تَصَدَّقَ بِهِ فَهُوَ كَفَّارَةٌ لَّهُ وَمَن لَّمْ يَحْكُم بِمَآ أنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ فَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلظَّالِمُونَ,And therein in the Torah We prescribed We made obligatory for them that a life be slain in return for a life if it has slain one; and an eye should be gouged out for an eye and a nose is to be cut off for a nose and an ear is to be amputated for an ear and a tooth should be pulled out for a tooth a variant reading has the last four nouns in the nominative; and for wounds read wa’l-jurūhu or wa’l-jurūha retaliation that is the person is entitled to retaliate if this is feasible as in the case of a hand or a leg; but in cases where one is not able to retaliate this is left to arbitration. Although this stipulation was prescribed for them it is established in our Law; but whoever forgoes it that is retaliation out of charity able to restrain himself then that shall be an expiation for him of what he has done of other sins. Whoever does not judge according to what God has revealed in the matter of retaliation and otherwise those are the evildoers.
وَقَفَّيْنَا عَلَىٰ آثَارِهِم بِعَيسَى ٱبْنِ مَرْيَمَ مُصَدِّقاً لِّمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ مِنَ ٱلتَوْرَاةِ وَآتَيْنَاهُ ٱلإِنجِيلَ فِيهِ هُدًى وَنُورٌ وَمُصَدِّقاً لِّمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ مِنَ ٱلتَّوْرَاةِ وَهُدًى وَمَوْعِظَةً لِّلْمُتَّقِينَ,And We caused Jesus son of Mary to follow in their that is the prophets’ footsteps confirming the Torah before him; and We gave to him the Gospel wherein is guidance from error and light an exposition of the rulings confirming musaddiqan is a circumstantial qualifier the Torah before it the rulings contained therein and as a guidance and an admonition to the God-fearing.
وَلْيَحْكُمْ أَهْلُ ٱلإِنْجِيلِ بِمَآ أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ فِيهِ وَمَن لَّمْ يَحْكُم بِمَآ أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ فَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْفَاسِقُونَ,We said So let the People of the Gospel judge according to what God has revealed therein of rulings a variant reading of wa’l-yahkum ‘let them judge’ is wa-li-yahkuma making it a supplement to that which is governed by the previous verb ātaynāhu ‘We gave to him’. Whoever does not judge according to what God has revealed — those are the wicked.
وَأَنزَلْنَآ إِلَيْكَ ٱلْكِتَابَ بِٱلْحَقِّ مُصَدِّقاً لِّمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ مِنَ ٱلْكِتَابِ وَمُهَيْمِناً عَلَيْهِ فَٱحْكُم بَيْنَهُم بِمَآ أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ وَلاَ تَتَّبِعْ أَهْوَآءَهُمْ عَمَّا جَآءَكَ مِنَ ٱلْحَقِّ لِكُلٍّ جَعَلْنَا مِنكُمْ شِرْعَةً وَمِنْهَاجاً وَلَوْ شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ لَجَعَلَكُمْ أُمَّةً وَاحِدَةً وَلَـٰكِن لِّيَبْلُوَكُمْ فِي مَآ آتَاكُم فَاسْتَبِقُوا الخَيْرَاتِ إِلَىٰ الله مَرْجِعُكُمْ جَمِيعاً فَيُنَبِّئُكُم بِمَا كُنتُمْ فِيهِ تَخْتَلِفُونَ,And We have revealed to you O Muhammad (s) the Book the Qur’ān with the truth bi’l-haqq is semantically connected to anzalnā ‘We have revealed’ confirming the Book that was before it and watching over it testifying to it — the ‘Book’ means the Scriptures. So judge between them between the People of the Scripture if they take their cases before you according to what God has revealed to you and do not follow their whims deviating away from the truth that has come to you. To every one of you O communities We have appointed a divine law and a way a clear path in religion for them to proceed along. If God had willed He would have made you one community following one Law but He separated you one from the other that He may try you in what He has given to you of the differing Laws in order to see who among you is obedient and who is disobedient. So vie with one another in good works strive hastily thereunto; to God you shall all return through resurrection and He will then inform you of that in which you differed in the matter of religion and requite each of you according to his deeds.
وَأَنِ ٱحْكُم بَيْنَهُمْ بِمَآ أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ وَلاَ تَتَّبِعْ أَهْوَآءَهُمْ وَٱحْذَرْهُمْ أَن يَفْتِنُوكَ عَن بَعْضِ مَآ أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ إِلَيْكَ فَإِن تَوَلَّوْاْ فَٱعْلَمْ أَنَّمَا يُرِيدُ ٱللَّهُ أَن يُصِيبَهُم بِبَعْضِ ذُنُوبِهِمْ وَإِنَّ كَثِيراً مِّنَ ٱلنَّاسِ لَفَاسِقُونَ,And judge between them according to what God has revealed and do not follow their whims and beware of them lest they seduce you lest they lead you astray from part of what God has revealed to you. But if they turn away from the judgement revealed and desire some other then know that God desires to smite them with punishment in this world for some of their sins those which they have committed among them their turning away and that He desires to requite them for all of their sins in the Hereafter; surely many of mankind are wicked.
أَفَحُكْمَ ٱلْجَاهِلِيَّةِ يَبْغُونَ وَمَنْ أَحْسَنُ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ حُكْماً لِّقَوْمٍ يُوقِنُونَ,Do they desire yabghūn is also read tabghūn ‘do you desire?’ do they seek the judgement of paganism through their deceit and deviation when they turn away? this is an interrogative meant as a disavowal. Yet who that is no one is better in judgement than God for a people knowing Him with certainty? These people are singled out for mention because they are the ones who reflect.
يَـٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ لاَ تَتَّخِذُواْ ٱلْيَهُودَ وَٱلنَّصَارَىٰ أَوْلِيَآءَ بَعْضُهُمْ أَوْلِيَآءُ بَعْضٍ وَمَن يَتَوَلَّهُمْ مِّنكُمْ فَإِنَّهُ مِنْهُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لاَ يَهْدِي ٱلْقَوْمَ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ,O you who believe do not take Jews and Christians as patrons affiliating with them or showing them affection; they are patrons of each other being united in disbelief. Whoever amongst you affiliates with them he is one of them counted with them. God does not guide the folk who do wrong by affiliating with disbelievers.
فَتَرَى ٱلَّذِينَ فِي قُلُوبِهِم مَّرَضٌ يُسَارِعُونَ فِيهِمْ يَقُولُونَ نَخْشَىٰ أَن تُصِيبَنَا دَآئِرَةٌ فَعَسَى ٱللَّهُ أَن يَأْتِيَ بِٱلْفَتْحِ أَوْ أَمْرٍ مِّنْ عِندِهِ فَيُصْبِحُواْ عَلَىٰ مَآ أَسَرُّواْ فِيۤ أَنْفُسِهِمْ نَادِمِينَ,And you see those in whose hearts is sickness weakness of faith the like of ‘Abd Allāh b. Ubayy the hypocrite; vying with one another for them to affiliate with them saying as an excuse for this ‘We fear lest we suffer a turn of fortune’ which time will bring round against us such as drought or defeat and that if Muhammad’s affair should come to nothing they will cease to supply us with provisions. God exalted be He says But it may be that God will bring victory by assisting His Prophet and making His religion prevail; or some commandment from Him that will reveal the secrets of the hypocrites disgracing them; and then they will end up for what they kept secret within themselves in the way of doubt and affiliating with disbelievers remorseful.
وَيَقُولُ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ أَهُـۤؤُلاۤءِ ٱلَّذِينَ أَقْسَمُواْ بِٱللَّهِ جَهْدَ أَيْمَانِهِمْ إِنَّهُمْ لَمَعَكُمْ حَبِطَتْ أَعْمَالُهُمْ فَأَصْبَحُواْ خَاسِرِينَ,And they say read wa-yaqūlu or just yaqūlu to indicate a new independent sentence; or wa-yaqūla as a supplement to what follows those who believe to one another in amazement when their secrets are revealed ‘Are these the ones who swore by God their most earnest oaths making the utmost effort thereby to swear that they were surely with you? in religion. God exalted be He says Their good works have failed are invalid; and they have become they have ended up as the losers’ in this world through ignominy and in the Hereafter through their punishment.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ مَن يَرْتَدَّ مِنكُمْ عَن دِينِهِ فَسَوْفَ يَأْتِي ٱللَّهُ بِقَوْمٍ يُحِبُّهُمْ وَيُحِبُّونَهُ أَذِلَّةٍ عَلَى ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ أَعِزَّةٍ عَلَى ٱلْكَافِرِينَ يُجَاهِدُونَ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ وَلاَ يَخَافُونَ لَوْمَةَ لاۤئِمٍ ذٰلِكَ فَضْلُ ٱللَّهِ يُؤْتِيهِ مَن يَشَآءُ وَٱللَّهُ وَاسِعٌ عَلِيمٌ,O you who believe whoever of you apostatises read either yartadid with separation of the two dāl letters or yartadd with assimilation of one of the dāl letters with the other turns back from his religion to disbelief — this is a notification of what God knew would happen for some of them apostatised upon the death of the Prophet s — God will assuredly bring in their place a people whom He loves and who love Him the Prophet s said ‘They are people like him’ and he pointed to Abū Mūsā al-Ash‘arī as reported by al-Hākim al-Naysābūrī in his Sahīh; humble sympathetic towards believers stern severe towards disbelievers struggling in the way of God and fearing not the reproach of any reproacher therein in the way that the hypocrites fear the reproach of the disbelievers. That description mentioned is God’s bounty; He gives it to whom He will; and God is Embracing of abundant bounty Knowing of those who deserve it.
إِنَّمَا وَلِيُّكُمُ ٱللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُ وَٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ ٱلَّذِينَ يُقِيمُونَ ٱلصَّلاَةَ وَيُؤْتُونَ ٱلزَّكَاةَ وَهُمْ رَاكِعُونَ,When ‘Abd Allāh Ibn Salām said ‘O Messenger of God our people have shunned us’ the following was revealed Your patron is God only and His Messenger and the believers who establish prayer and pay the alms bowing down humble or performing voluntary prayers.
وَمَن يَتَوَلَّ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ وَٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ فَإِنَّ حِزْبَ ٱللَّهِ هُمُ ٱلْغَالِبُونَ,Whoever affiliates to God and His Messenger and the believers He will help them and assist them; for verily the party of God they are the victors because of His assistance to them He has made this hizb Allāh ‘the party of God’ to fall in the place of an implied fa-innahum ‘for verily they’ as an explication since they belong to His party that is they His followers.
يَـٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ لاَ تَتَّخِذُواْ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱتَّخَذُواْ دِينَكُمْ هُزُواً وَلَعِباً مِّنَ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ ٱلْكِتَابَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ وَٱلْكُفَّارَ أَوْلِيَآءَ وَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ إِن كُنتُم مُّؤْمِنِينَ,O you who believe do not take as patrons those who take your religion in mockery as something to be mocked and as a game from among min is explicative those who were given the Scripture before you and from among the disbelievers read al-kuffāri or al-kuffāra the idolaters — and fear God by refraining from affiliating with them if you are believers if you are truthful in your faith.
وَإِذَا نَادَيْتُمْ إِلَى ٱلصَّلاَةِ ٱتَّخَذُوهَا هُزُواً وَلَعِباً ذٰلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ قَوْمٌ لاَّ يَعْقِلُونَ,And those who when you make the call to prayer take it that is the prayer in mockery and as a game mocking it and laughing at it among themselves; that mocking attitude is because they are a people who do not understand.
قُلْ يَـٰأَهْلَ ٱلْكِتَابِ هَلْ تَنقِمُونَ مِنَّآ إِلاَّ أَنْ آمَنَّا بِٱللَّهِ وَمَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْنَا وَمَآ أُنزِلَ مِن قَبْلُ وَأَنَّ أَكْثَرَكُمْ فَاسِقُونَ,The following was revealed when the Jews said to the Prophet s ‘Whom among the messengers do you believe in?’ and he replied in God and in that which has been revealed to us Q. 2136 and when he mentioned Jesus they said ‘We know of no religion worse than yours!’ Say ‘O People of the Scripture do you spite do you repudiate us for any other cause than that we believe in God and what has been revealed to us and what was revealed to the prophets before and that most of you are wicked?’ wa-anna aktharakum fāsiqūn is a supplement to an āmannā ‘that we believe’ that is to say ‘What you repudiate in fact is our faith and your opposition to it in refusing to accept it — a refusal which is described as ‘wickedness’ this wickedness itself being the necessary consequence of such a refusal — but in fact this faith of ours is not something to be repudiated’.
قُلْ هَلْ أُنَبِّئُكُمْ بِشَرٍّ مِّن ذٰلِكَ مَثُوبَةً عِندَ ٱللَّهِ مَن لَّعَنَهُ ٱللَّهُ وَغَضِبَ عَلَيْهِ وَجَعَلَ مِنْهُمُ ٱلْقِرَدَةَ وَٱلْخَنَازِيرَ وَعَبَدَ ٱلطَّاغُوتَ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ شَرٌّ مَّكَاناً وَأَضَلُّ عَن سَوَآءِ ٱلسَّبِيلِ,Say ‘Shall I tell you shall I inform you of what is worse than the followers of that about which you are spiteful by way of reward requital from God? They are those whom God has cursed whom He has removed from His mercy and with whom He is wroth and some of whom He has turned into apes and swine by transformation and those who worship the false deity Satan by obeying him the particle minhum ‘some of whom’ takes into account the potentially plural import of the particle min ‘those whom’ and in what precedes minhum ‘some of whom’ the singular form of min is taken into account; a variant reading has ‘abuda al-tāghūt as the genitive of an annexation ‘abud being a variant plural of ‘abd; the accusative ending of ‘abuda is because the clause is a supplement to al-qirada ‘apes’ and these were the Jews. They are worse situated makānan is for specification for their abode shall be the Fire and further astray from the even way’ from the path of truth al-sawā’ originally means al-wasat ‘middle’; the use of sharrun ‘worse’ and adallu ‘further astray’ is intended to counter their saying ‘We know of no religion worse sharrun than yours’.
وَإِذَا جَآءُوكُمْ قَالُوۤاْ آمَنَّا وَقَدْ دَّخَلُواْ بِٱلْكُفْرِ وَهُمْ قَدْ خَرَجُواْ بِهِ وَٱللَّهُ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا كَانُواْ يَكْتُمُونَ,When they the hypocrites from among the Jews come to you they say ‘We believe’; but they have entered unto you ensconced in disbelief and so they have departed from you ensconced in it and they have not believed. And God knows very well what they were hiding of hypocrisy.
وَتَرَىٰ كَثِيراً مِّنْهُمْ يُسَارِعُونَ فِي ٱلإِثْمِ وَٱلْعُدْوَانِ وَأَكْلِهِمُ ٱلسُّحْتَ لَبِئْسَ مَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ,And you see many of them namely the Jews vying falling headlong in sin in calumny and enmity wrongdoing and their consuming of unlawful gain what is illicit like bribes; evil is that deed of theirs which they have been committing.
لَوْلاَ يَنْهَاهُمُ ٱلرَّبَّانِيُّونَ وَٱلأَحْبَارُ عَن قَوْلِهِمُ ٱلإِثْمَ وَأَكْلِهِمُ ٱلسُّحْتَ لَبِئْسَ مَا كَانُواْ يَصْنَعُونَ,Why do the rabbis and the priests among them not forbid them from uttering sin calumny and consuming unlawful gain? Evil is what they have been doing in refraining from forbidding them.
وَقَالَتِ ٱلْيَهُودُ يَدُ ٱللَّهِ مَغْلُولَةٌ غُلَّتْ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَلُعِنُواْ بِمَا قَالُواْ بَلْ يَدَاهُ مَبْسُوطَتَانِ يُنفِقُ كَيْفَ يَشَآءُ وَلَيَزِيدَنَّ كَثِيراً مِّنْهُم مَّآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ مِن رَّبِّكَ طُغْيَاناً وَكُفْراً وَأَلْقَيْنَا بَيْنَهُمُ ٱلْعَدَاوَةَ وَٱلْبَغْضَآءَ إِلَىٰ يَوْمِ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ كُلَّمَآ أَوْقَدُواْ نَاراً لِّلْحَرْبِ أَطْفَأَهَا ٱللَّهُ وَيَسْعَوْنَ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ فَسَاداً وَٱللَّهُ لاَ يُحِبُّ ٱلْمُفْسِدِينَ,The Jews said when their circumstances became straitened on account of their denial of the Prophet s after having been the wealthiest of people ‘God’s hand is fettered’ withholding the sending forth of provision upon us — this was their metaphor for niggardliness — may God be exalted above this. God exalted be He says Fettered be withheld be their hands from the performance of good deeds as an invocation against them; and they are cursed for what they have said. Nay but His hands are extended out wide — a hyperbole for the attribute of generosity — the use of yadā the dual for yad ‘hand’ is intended to imply abundance since the utmost that an affluent person can give freely of his wealth is when he gives it with both hands. He expends how He will in giving abundantly or straitening and there can be no objection to this. And what has been revealed to you from your Lord of the Qur’ān will surely increase many of them in insolence and disbelief because of their very disbelief in it; and We have cast between them enmity and hatred until the Day of Resurrection and so every sect among them is opposed to the other. Every time they light the fires of war that is for war against the Prophet s God extinguishes them that is every time they desire it war He repels them. And they hasten about the earth in corruption that is they hasten about corrupting through acts of disobedience and God does not love corrupters meaning that He will punish them.
وَلَوْ أَنَّ أَهْلَ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ ءَامَنُواْ وَٱتَّقَوْاْ لَكَفَّرْنَا عَنْهُمْ سَيِّئَاتِهِمْ وَلأَدْخَلْنَٰهُمْ جَنَّٰتِ ٱلنَّعِيمِ,But had the People of the Scripture believed in Muhammad (s) and feared unbelief We would have absolved them of their evil deeds and We would admitted them to Gardens of Bliss.
وَلَوْ أَنَّهُمْ أَقَامُواْ ٱلتَّوْرَاةَ وَٱلإِنْجِيلَ وَمَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيهِمْ مِّن رَّبِّهِمْ لأَكَلُواْ مِن فَوْقِهِمْ وَمِن تَحْتِ أَرْجُلِهِم مِّنْهُمْ أُمَّةٌ مُّقْتَصِدَةٌ وَكَثِيرٌ مِّنْهُمْ سَآءَ مَا يَعْمَلُونَ,And had they observed the Torah and the Gospel by implementing what is in them including believing in the Prophet s and what was revealed to them of scriptures from their Lord they would surely have received nourishment from above them and from beneath their feet by their being given provision in abundance with it pouring forth from every place. Some of them a group among them are a just community implementing it the Torah and they are the ones who believed in the Prophet s the likes of ‘Abd Allāh b. Salām and his companions; but many of them — evil is that thing which they do.
يَـٰأَيُّهَا ٱلرَّسُولُ بَلِّغْ مَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ مِن رَّبِّكَ وَإِن لَّمْ تَفْعَلْ فَمَا بَلَّغْتَ رِسَالَتَهُ وَٱللَّهُ يَعْصِمُكَ مِنَ ٱلنَّاسِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لاَ يَهْدِي ٱلْقَوْمَ ٱلْكَافِرِينَ,O Messenger make known all of that which has been revealed to you from your Lord and do not conceal any of it out of fear that you may suffer some harm; for if you do not that is if you do not make known all of what has been revealed to you you will not have conveyed His Message risālatahu or read plural risālātihi ‘His Messages’ since to conceal some of it is to conceal it all. God will protect you from people who may try to kill you. The Prophet s used to have guards up until the time that this verse was revealed then he said ‘Depart for God protects me now’ as reported by al-Hākim. God does not guide the unbelieving folk.
قُلْ يَـٰأَهْلَ ٱلْكِتَابِ لَسْتُمْ عَلَىٰ شَيْءٍ حَتَّىٰ تُقِيمُواْ ٱلتَّوْرَاةَ وَٱلإِنْجِيلَ وَمَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكُمْ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَلَيَزِيدَنَّ كَثِيراً مِّنْهُمْ مَّآ أُنْزِلَ إِلَيْكَ مِن رَّبِّكَ طُغْيَاناً وَكُفْراً فَلاَ تَأْسَ عَلَى ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلْكَافِرِينَ,Say ‘O People of the Scripture you have no basis in religion on which to rely until you observe the Torah and the Gospel and what was revealed to you from your Lord’ by implementing what is therein including believing in me Muhammad (s). And what has been revealed to you from your Lord of the Qur’ān will surely increase many of them in insolence and disbelief because of their disbelief in it; so do not grieve for the disbelieving folk if they do not believe in you in other words do not be concerned with them.
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَٱلَّذِينَ هَادُواْ وَٱلصَّابِئُونَ وَٱلنَّصَارَىٰ مَنْ آمَنَ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلآخِرِ وعَمِلَ صَالِحاً فَلاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلاَ هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ,Surely those who believe and those of Jewry this constitutes the subject of the clause namely the Jews and the Sabaeans a sect among them and the Christians and what follows substitutes for the above subject whoever of them believes in God and the Last Day and behaves righteously — no fear shall befall them neither shall they grieve in the Hereafter this fa-lā khawfun ‘alayhim wa-lā hum yahzanūn ‘no fear shall befall them neither shall they grieve’ is the predicate of the subject and also indicates the predicate of the clause beginning with inna ‘surely’.
لَقَدْ أَخَذْنَا مِيثَاقَ بَنِيۤ إِسْرَائِيلَ وَأَرْسَلْنَآ إِلَيْهِمْ رُسُلاً كُلَّمَا جَآءَهُمْ رَسُولٌ بِمَا لاَ تَهْوَىٰ أَنْفُسُهُمْ فَرِيقاً كَذَّبُواْ وَفَرِيقاً يَقْتُلُونَ,And We made a covenant with the Children of Israel to believe in God and His messengers and We sent messengers to them. Every time a messenger came to them from among them with what their souls did not desire in the way of truth they denied it; some of them they denied and some of them they slay such as Zachariah and John the use of the present tense yaqtulūn ‘they slay’ instead of the perfect tense qatalū is to narrate past events as if in the present and to conclude in harmony with the end-rhyme of the verses.
وَحَسِبُوۤاْ أَلاَّ تَكُونَ فِتْنَةٌ فَعَمُواْ وَصَمُّواْ ثُمَّ تَابَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْهِمْ ثُمَّ عَمُواْ وَصَمُّواْ كَثِيرٌ مِّنْهُمْ وَٱللَّهُ بَصِيرٌ بِمَا يَعْمَلُونَ,And they thought they presumed that there would be no read as an lā takūnu where an has been softened; or read an lā takūna where it an requires a following subjunctive that is to say ‘that there would not befall them’ trial a punishment against them for their denial of the messengers and their slaying of them; and so they were wilfully blind to the truth and could not see it and deaf unable to hear it. Then God relented to them when they repented then they were wilfully blind and deaf a second time many of them kathīrun minhum substitutes for the third person ‘they’; and God sees what they do and will requite them for it.
لَقَدْ كَفَرَ ٱلَّذِينَ قَالُوۤاْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ هُوَ ٱلْمَسِيحُ ٱبْنُ مَرْيَمَ وَقَالَ ٱلْمَسِيحُ يَابَنِيۤ إِسْرَائِيلَ ٱعْبُدُواْ ٱللَّهَ رَبِّي وَرَبَّكُمْ إِنَّهُ مَن يُشْرِكْ بِٱللَّهِ فَقَدْ حَرَّمَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيهِ ٱلْجَنَّةَ وَمَأْوَاهُ ٱلنَّارُ وَمَا لِلظَّالِمِينَ مِنْ أَنصَارٍ,They indeed are disbelievers those who say ‘Indeed God is the Messiah son of Mary’ a similar verse has preceded Q. 517. For the Messiah said to them ‘O Children of Israel worship God my Lord and your Lord for I am a servant and not a god. Verily he who associates anything with God in worship for him God has made Paradise forbidden He has forbidden him admittance to it and his abode shall be the Fire; and for wrongdoers wa-mā li’l-zālimīna min the min is extra there shall be no helpers’ to guard them against the chastisement of God.
لَّقَدْ كَفَرَ ٱلَّذِينَ قَالُوۤاْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ ثَالِثُ ثَلاَثَةٍ وَمَا مِنْ إِلَـٰهٍ إِلاَّ إِلَـٰهٌ وَاحِدٌ وَإِن لَّمْ يَنتَهُواْ عَمَّا يَقُولُونَ لَيَمَسَّنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِنْهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,They are indeed disbelievers those who say ‘God is the third of three’ gods that is He is one of them the other two being Jesus and his mother and they who claim this are a Christian sect; when there is no god but the One God. If they do not desist from what they say when they declare a trinity and profess His Oneness those of them who disbelieve that is those who are fixed upon unbelief shall suffer a painful chastisement namely the Fire.
أَفَلاَ يَتُوبُونَ إِلَىٰ ٱللَّهِ وَيَسْتَغْفِرُونَهُ وَٱللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,Will they not turn in repentance to God and seek His forgiveness? for what they say the interrogative is intended as a rebuke; God is Forgiving to the one who repents Merciful to him.
مَّا ٱلْمَسِيحُ ٱبْنُ مَرْيَمَ إِلاَّ رَسُولٌ قَدْ خَلَتْ مِن قَبْلِهِ ٱلرُّسُلُ وَأُمُّهُ صِدِّيقَةٌ كَانَا يَأْكُلاَنِ ٱلطَّعَامَ ٱنْظُرْ كَيْفَ نُبَيِّنُ لَهُمُ ٱلآيَاتِ ثُمَّ ٱنْظُرْ أَنَّىٰ يُؤْفَكُونَ,The Messiah son of Mary was only a messenger; messengers passed away before him and so he passed away like them for he is not a god as they claim otherwise he would not have passed away; his mother was a truthful woman siddīqa means extremely truthful; they both used to eat food like all other human beings and one who is such cannot be a god because of his compound being and fallible nature and because of the impurities such as urine and excrement that he produces. Behold in amazement how We make the signs of Our Oneness clear to them then behold how they are turned away! how they are turned away from the truth despite the proof being established.
قُلْ أَتَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ مَا لاَ يَمْلِكُ لَكُمْ ضَرّاً وَلاَ نَفْعاً وَٱللَّهُ هُوَ ٱلسَّمِيعُ ٱلْعَلِيمُ,Say ‘Do you worship besides God that is other than Him what cannot hurt or profit you? God is the Hearer of your sayings the Knower’ of your circumstances the interrogative is meant as a disavowal.
قُلْ يَـٰأَهْلَ ٱلْكِتَابِ لاَ تَغْلُواْ فِي دِينِكُمْ غَيْرَ ٱلْحَقِّ وَلاَ تَتَّبِعُوۤاْ أَهْوَآءَ قَوْمٍ قَدْ ضَلُّواْ مِن قَبْلُ وَأَضَلُّواْ كَثِيراً وَضَلُّواْ عَن سَوَآءِ ٱلسَّبِيلِ,Say ‘O People of the Scripture Jews and Christians do not go to extremes do not overstep the bounds in your religion other than those extremes of truth neither lowering nor elevating Jesus above his proper place and do not follow the whims of a people who went astray formerly on account of their extremism — these were their forefathers — and have led many other people astray and strayed from the even way’ from the path of truth al-sawā’ originally means ‘middle’.
لُعِنَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِن بَنِيۤ إِسْرَائِيلَ عَلَىٰ لِسَانِ دَاوُودَ وَعِيسَى ٱبْنِ مَرْيَمَ ذٰلِكَ بِمَا عَصَوْا وَّكَانُواْ يَعْتَدُونَ,Cursed were the disbelievers of the Children of Israel by the tongue of David when he invoked God against them and they were transformed into apes — these were the people of Eilat — and by Jesus son of Mary when he invoked God against them and they were transformed into pigs — they were the ones who ate at the Table cf. Q. 5115 below — that cursing was because of their disobedience and their transgression.
كَانُواْ لاَ يَتَنَاهَوْنَ عَن مُّنكَرٍ فَعَلُوهُ لَبِئْسَ مَا كَانُواْ يَفْعَلُونَ,They did not prevent one another that is one would not forbid the other from committing again any indecency that they committed; verily evil was what they used to do verily evil was this deed of theirs.
تَرَىٰ كَثِيراً مِّنْهُمْ يَتَوَلَّوْنَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لَبِئْسَ مَا قَدَّمَتْ لَهُمْ أَنفُسُهُمْ أَن سَخِطَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْهِمْ وَفِي ٱلْعَذَابِ هُمْ خَالِدُونَ,You O Muhammad (s) see many of them affiliating with those who disbelieve from among the Meccans out of spite for you. Evil is that in the way of deeds which their souls have offered on their behalf for the day of their inevitable return such that God is wroth with them and in the chastisement they shall abide.
وَلَوْ كَانُوا يُؤْمِنُونَ بِالله والنَّبِيِّ وَمَا أُنْزِلَ إِلَيْهِ مَا اتَّخَذُوهُمْ أَوْلِيَآءَ وَلَـٰكِنَّ كَثِيراً مِّنْهُمْ فَاسِقُونَ,Yet had they believed in God and the Prophet Muhammad (s) and what has been revealed to him they would not have affiliated with them namely with the disbelievers; but many of them are wicked rebellious against faith.
لَتَجِدَنَّ أَشَدَّ ٱلنَّاسِ عَدَاوَةً لِّلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ ٱلْيَهُودَ وَٱلَّذِينَ أَشْرَكُواْ وَلَتَجِدَنَّ أَقْرَبَهُمْ مَّوَدَّةً لِّلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ ٱلَّذِينَ قَالُوۤاْ إِنَّا نَصَارَىٰ ذٰلِكَ بِأَنَّ مِنْهُمْ قِسِّيسِينَ وَرُهْبَاناً وَأَنَّهُمْ لاَ يَسْتَكْبِرُونَ,You O Muhammad (s) will truly find the most hostile of people to those who believe to be the Jews and the idolaters of Mecca because of the intensity of their disbelief ignorance and utter preoccupation with following whims; and you will truly find the nearest of them in love to those who believe to be those who say ‘Verily we are Christians’; that nearness of theirs in love to the believers is because some of them are priests scholars and monks devout worshippers and because they are not disdainful of following the truth as the Jews and the Meccans are.
وَإِذَا سَمِعُواْ مَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَى ٱلرَّسُولِ تَرَىۤ أَعْيُنَهُمْ تَفِيضُ مِنَ ٱلدَّمْعِ مِمَّا عَرَفُواْ مِنَ ٱلْحَقِّ يَقُولُونَ رَبَّنَآ آمَنَّا فَٱكْتُبْنَا مَعَ ٱلشَّاهِدِينَ,This verse was revealed when the Negus’s delegation from Abyssinia came to him s when the Prophet s recited sūrat Yā Sīn they cried and submitted to Islam saying ‘How similar this is to what used to be revealed to Jesus!’ God exalted be He says And when they hear what has been revealed to the Messenger of the Qur’ān you see their eyes overflow with tears because of what they recognise of the truth. They say ‘Our Lord we believe we accept the truth of your Prophet and your Book so inscribe us among the witnesses those who affirm their acceptance of the truth.
وَمَا لَنَا لاَ نُؤْمِنُ بِٱللَّهِ وَمَا جَآءَنَا مِنَ ٱلْحَقِّ وَنَطْمَعُ أَن يُدْخِلَنَا رَبُّنَا مَعَ ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلصَّالِحِينَ,And in response to those Jews who reviled them for their Islam they would say why should we not believe in God and what has come to us of the truth the Qur’ān that is to say there is nothing to prevent us from faith when its prerequisites are present; and hope natma‘u is a supplement to nu’minu ‘we believe’ that our Lord should admit us with the righteous people?’ the believers into Paradise?
فَأَثَابَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ بِمَا قَالُواْ جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلأَنْهَارُ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا وَذٰلِكَ جَزَآءُ ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,God exalted be He says So God has rewarded them for what they have said with Gardens underneath which rivers flow wherein they will abide; that is the requital of those who are virtuous by believing.
وَٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَكَذَّبُواْ بِآيَٰتِنَآ أُوْلَـۤئِكَ أَصْحَٰبُ ٱلْجَحِيمِ,But those who disbelieve and deny Our signs — they are the inhabitants of Hell-fire.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ لاَ تُحَرِّمُواْ طَيِّبَاتِ مَآ أَحَلَّ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمْ وَلاَ تَعْتَدُوۤاْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لاَ يُحِبُّ ٱلْمُعْتَدِينَ,When a number of Companions resolved to practise fasting and night vigil continuously and to abstain from women perfume consumption of meat and sleeping on beds the following was revealed O you who believe do not forbid the good things that God has made lawful for you and do not transgress do not exceed God’s command; God does not love transgressors.
وَكُلُواْ مِمَّا رَزَقَكُمُ ٱللَّهُ حَلَـٰلاً طَيِّباً وَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ ٱلَّذِيۤ أَنتُم بِهِ مُؤْمِنُونَ,And eat of the lawful and good food which God has provided you halālan tayyiban ‘lawful and good food’ is the direct object and the preceding genitive construction mimmā ‘of … which’ is a circumstantial qualifier connected to the former; and fear God in Whom you are believers.
لاَ يُؤَاخِذُكُمُ ٱللَّهُ بِٱللَّغْوِ فِيۤ أَيْمَانِكُمْ وَلَـٰكِن يُؤَاخِذُكُم بِمَا عَقَّدتُّمُ ٱلأَيْمَانَ فَكَفَّارَتُهُ إِطْعَامُ عَشَرَةِ مَسَاكِينَ مِنْ أَوْسَطِ مَا تُطْعِمُونَ أَهْلِيكُمْ أَوْ كِسْوَتُهُمْ أَوْ تَحْرِيرُ رَقَبَةٍ فَمَن لَّمْ يَجِدْ فَصِيَامُ ثَلاَثَةِ أَيَّامٍ ذٰلِكَ كَفَّارَةُ أَيْمَانِكُمْ إِذَا حَلَفْتُمْ وَٱحْفَظُوۤاْ أَيْمَانَكُمْ كَذٰلِكَ يُبَيِّنُ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمْ آيَاتِهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ,God will not take you to task for a slip contained in your oaths which is what the tongue utters spontaneously without intending to swear an oath such as when one says ‘No by God’ or ‘Yes by God’; but He will take you to task for that to which you have pledged read ‘aqadtum ‘aqqadttum or ‘āqadttum oaths where you have sworn an oath intentionally; the expiation thereof of the oath if you break it is the feeding of ten of the needy for each needy person one mudd measure of the midmost food from which you feed your families that is the closest or the principal food you consume neither better nor worse; or the clothing of them with what may be properly called clothes such as a shirt a turban or a loin cloth — it is not sufficient that these items mentioned be given only to one needy person according to al-Shāfi‘ī; or the setting free of a believing slave as applies in the expiation for slaying or repudiation through zihār interpreting the general stipulation in a restricted sense; and whoever does not find the means for any one of the expiations mentioned then the fasting of three days as an expiation for him — as it appears in this verse it is not obligatory to follow the above sequence of alternatives when making an expiation and this is the opinion of al-Shāfi‘ī. That which is mentioned is the expiation of your oaths if you have sworn and have broken them; but keep your oaths do not break them unless it be for a righteous deed or setting right between people as stated in the verse of sūrat al-Baqara Q. 2225. So in the same way that He has explained to you what has been mentioned God makes clear to you His signs so that you might be thankful to Him for this.
يَٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ إِنَّمَا ٱلْخَمْرُ وَٱلْمَيْسِرُ وَٱلأَنصَابُ وَٱلأَزْلاَمُ رِجْسٌ مِّنْ عَمَلِ ٱلشَّيْطَانِ فَٱجْتَنِبُوهُ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ,O you who believe verily wine that intoxicates and overcomes the mind and games of chance gambling and idols and divinatory arrows are an abomination an evil deemed vile of Satan’s work which he adorns; so avoid it this abomination consisting of the things mentioned do not do it; so that you might prosper.
إِنَّمَا يُرِيدُ ٱلشَّيْطَانُ أَن يُوقِعَ بَيْنَكُمُ ٱلْعَدَاوَةَ وَٱلْبَغْضَآءَ فِي ٱلْخَمْرِ وَٱلْمَيْسِرِ وَيَصُدَّكُمْ عَن ذِكْرِ ٱللَّهِ وَعَنِ ٱلصَّلاَةِ فَهَلْ أَنْتُمْ مُّنتَهُونَ,Satan desires only to precipitate enmity and hatred between you through wine and games of chance when you partake of them because of the evil and discord that result therefrom; and to bar you by your being preoccupied with them from the remembrance of God and from prayer — He has specifically mentioned it prayer so as to magnify it. So will you then desist? from partaking of them? In other words Desist!
وَأَطِيعُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَأَطِيعُواْ ٱلرَّسُولَ وَٱحْذَرُواْ فَإِن تَوَلَّيْتُمْ فَٱعْلَمُوۤاْ أَنَّمَا عَلَىٰ رَسُولِنَا ٱلْبَلاَغُ ٱلْمُبِينُ,And obey God and obey the Messenger and beware of disobedient acts; but if you turn away from obedience then know that Our Messenger’s duty is only to proclaim plainly to convey clearly the Message — your requital falls on Us.
لَيْسَ عَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ جُنَاحٌ فِيمَا طَعِمُوۤاْ إِذَا مَا ٱتَّقَواْ وَآمَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّالِحَاتِ ثُمَّ اتَّقَواْ وَآمَنُواْ ثُمَّ اتَّقَواْ وَّأَحْسَنُواْ وَٱللَّهُ يُحِبُّ ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,Those who believe and perform righteous deeds are not at fault in what they may have consumed of wine and indulged in of gambling before the prohibition so long as they fear the forbidden things and believed and performed righteous deeds and then were God-fearing and believed and then adhered to fear of God and belief and then were God-fearing and virtuous in deeds; God loves the virtuous meaning that He will reward them.
يَـٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ لَيَبْلُوَنَّكُمُ ٱللَّهُ بِشَيْءٍ مِّنَ ٱلصَّيْدِ تَنَالُهُ أَيْدِيكُمْ وَرِمَاحُكُمْ لِيَعْلَمَ ٱللَّهُ مَن يَخَافُهُ بِٱلْغَيْبِ فَمَنِ ٱعْتَدَىٰ بَعْدَ ذٰلِكَ فَلَهُ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,O you who believe God will surely try you He will surely test you with some game which He releases to you the smaller of which will be caught by your hands and the larger of which by your lances this was in the plain of al-Hudaybiyya; while they were in the state of pilgrimage inviolability beasts and birds would flock to their caravans; so that God may know through knowledge outwardly manifested who fears Him in the Unseen bi’l-ghayb is a circumstantial qualifier in other words while He is absent to the eyes one who does not see Him but nonetheless avoids hunting game. Whoever transgresses thereafter after that prohibition against it and hunts his shall be a painful chastisement.
يَـٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ لاَ تَقْتُلُواْ ٱلصَّيْدَ وَأَنْتُمْ حُرُمٌ وَمَن قَتَلَهُ مِنكُم مُّتَعَمِّداً فَجَزَآءٌ مِّثْلُ مَا قَتَلَ مِنَ ٱلنَّعَمِ يَحْكُمُ بِهِ ذَوَا عَدْلٍ مِّنْكُمْ هَدْياً بَالِغَ ٱلْكَعْبَةِ أَوْ كَفَّارَةٌ طَعَامُ مَسَاكِينَ أَو عَدْلُ ذٰلِكَ صِيَاماً لِّيَذُوقَ وَبَالَ أَمْرِهِ عَفَا ٱللَّهُ عَمَّا سَلَف وَمَنْ عَادَ فَيَنْتَقِمُ ٱللَّهُ مِنْهُ وَٱللَّهُ عَزِيزٌ ذُو ٱنْتِقَامٍ,O you who believe do not slay game while you are in the state of pilgrimage inviolability for the hajj or the ‘umra; whoever of you slays it wilfully then the compensation shall be read fa-jazā’un ‘then the compensation shall be’ followed by a nominative mithlu ‘the like of’ that is to say a compensation is incumbent on him and that is the equivalent of what he has slain of flocks in other words a similar creature a variant reading has an annexation construction for jazā’ ‘compensation’ sc. fa-jazā’u mithli ‘then the compensation of’ to be judged that is the equivalent is to be judged by two just men among you both possessing astuteness with which they are able to identify the nearest animal in equivalence to it the slain animal. Ibn ‘Abbās ‘Umar and ‘Alī may God be pleased with them all adjudged a beast of sacrifice as redemption for an ostrich slain; Ibn ‘Abbās and Abū ‘Ubayda adjudged a cow as redemption for wildebeest or wild ass; ‘Abd Allāh Ibn ‘Umar and ‘Abd al-Rahmān Ibn ‘Awf a sheep for a gazelle and as Ibn ‘Abbās ‘Umar and others did a sheep also as a redemption for slaying pigeons because they pigeons resemble these sheep in taking scoops of water when drinking; an offering hadyan is a circumstantial qualifier referring to jazā’ ‘compensation’ to reach the Ka‘ba that is to be taken into the Sanctuary sacrificed there and given as a voluntary offering to its needy residents and it cannot be sacrificed wherever else it may be bāligha l-ka‘ba ‘to reach the Ka‘ba’ is in the accusative because it is an adjectival qualification of what precedes even if it stands as an annexation since such an annexation is only morphological and not valid as a grammatical characterisation; if there is no equivalent beast of flock for the game slain as in the case of a small bird or locusts then the person is obliged to compensate with equivalent value. Or it is incumbent on him to make an expiation other than compensation and if he should find the means then this expiation is food for the poor food to be taken from the principal food of the town equivalent to the value of the compensation being one mudd measure for each poor person a variant reading has kaffāra ‘expiation’ in an annexation with the following noun sc.
أُحِلَّ لَكُمْ صَيْدُ ٱلْبَحْرِ وَطَعَامُهُ مَتَاعاً لَّكُمْ وَلِلسَّيَّارَةِ وَحُرِّمَ عَلَيْكُمْ صَيْدُ ٱلْبَرِّ مَا دُمْتُمْ حُرُماً وَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ ٱلَّذِيۤ إِلَيْهِ تُحْشَرُونَ,Permitted to you O people be you in pilgrimage inviolability or not is the game of the sea for consumption and it is what can only live in the sea such as fish but not what is able to live both in the sea and on land such as crabs; and food from it what it casts out that is dead is a provision for you for you to consume and for the wayfarers the travellers among you to take as their provisions; but forbidden to you is the hunting of game on the land and this consists of those edible beasts that live on it; do not hunt them so long as you remain in pilgrimage inviolability if it is caught by one not in pilgrimage inviolability then it is permissible for a person in pilgrimage inviolability to consume it as is clarified in the Sunna; and fear God to whom you shall be gathered.
جَعَلَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْكَعْبَةَ ٱلْبَيْتَ ٱلْحَرَامَ قِيَٰماً لِّلنَّاسِ وَٱلشَّهْرَ ٱلْحَرَامَ وَٱلْهَدْيَ وَٱلْقَلاَئِدَ ذٰلِكَ لِتَعْلَمُوۤاْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَعْلَمُ مَا فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عَلِيمٌ,God has appointed the Ka‘ba the Sacred inviolable House as an enduring institution for mankind an institution by which their religious affair is sustained through pilgrimage to it as is their this-worldly affair on account of the security guaranteed for those who enter it and the fact that they are not interfered with and because all manner of fruits are brought to it a variant reading for qiyāman has qiyaman ‘always standing’ as the verbal noun from 1st form qāma ‘to remain standing’ without defectiveness of the middle radical; and the sacred month meaning the sacred months of Dhū’l-Qa‘da Dhū’l-Hijja Muharram and Rajab instituted for them to be secure from fighting during them; the offering and the garlands instituted for their owner so that he does not suffer any interference; that mentioned appointment is so that you may know that God knows all that is in the heavens and in the earth and that God has knowledge of all things thus that appointing of His in order to secure benefits for you and to ward off harm from you before such things came to pass testifies to His knowledge of all that is in existence and all that will be.
ٱعْلَمُوۤاْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ شَدِيدُ ٱلْعِقَابِ وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,Know that God is severe in punishment of His enemies and that God is Forgiving to His friends Merciful to them.
مَّا عَلَى ٱلرَّسُولِ إِلاَّ ٱلْبَلاَغُ وَٱللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ مَا تُبْدُونَ وَمَا تَكْتُمُونَ,The duty of the Messenger is only to convey the Message to you; and God knows what you reveal what deeds you manifest and what you hide and what of these you conceal and He will requite you for it.
قُل لاَّ يَسْتَوِي ٱلْخَبِيثُ وَٱلطَّيِّبُ وَلَوْ أَعْجَبَكَ كَثْرَةُ ٱلْخَبِيثِ فَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ يٰأُوْلِي ٱلأَلْبَابِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ,Say ‘The evil the unlawful and the good the lawful are not equal even though the abundance of the evil attract you.’ So fear God in avoiding it O people of pith so that you might prosper triumph.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ لاَ تَسْأَلُواْ عَنْ أَشْيَآءَ إِن تُبْدَ لَكُمْ تَسُؤْكُمْ وَإِن تَسْأَلُواْ عَنْهَا حِينَ يُنَزَّلُ ٱلْقُرْآنُ تُبْدَ لَكُمْ عَفَا ٱللَّهُ عَنْهَا وَٱللَّهُ غَفُورٌ حَلِيمٌ,The following was revealed when they began to ask the Prophet s too many questions O you who believe do not ask about things which if disclosed to you if revealed would trouble you because of the hardship that would ensue from them; yet if you ask about them while the Qur’ān is being revealed during the time of the Prophet s they will be disclosed to you meaning that if you ask about certain things during his lifetime the Qur’ān will reveal them but once these things are disclosed it will grieve you. So do not ask about them; indeed God has pardoned those things you asked about so do not ask again; for God is Forgiving Forbearing.
قَدْ سَأَلَهَا قَوْمٌ مِّن قَبْلِكُمْ ثُمَّ أَصْبَحُواْ بِهَا كَافِرِينَ,Verily a people before you asked about them that is they asked their prophets about such things and they received the response in the form of revealed explications of the rules concerning them; and then they disbelieved in them by neglecting to implement them.
مَا جَعَلَ ٱللَّهُ مِن بَحِيرَةٍ وَلاَ سَآئِبَةٍ وَلاَ وَصِيلَةٍ وَلاَ حَامٍ وَلَـٰكِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ يَفْتَرُونَ عَلَىٰ ٱللَّهِ ٱلْكَذِبَ وَأَكْثَرُهُمْ لاَ يَعْقِلُونَ,God has not ordained He has not stipulated in His Law anything such as a Bahīra a Sā’iba a Wasīla or a Hām in the way that people did at the time of paganism. Al-Bukhārī reported in a hadīth from Sa‘īd b. al-Musayyab who said ‘The bahīra is that camel whose milk is consecrated to idols and whom no human may milk; the sā’iba is the one they would leave to roam freely for their gods and was forbidden to bear any load; the wasīla is the young she-camel that would give birth to a young female as its first offspring followed by another female bearing one after the other without a male in between she would then be left to roam freely for their idols; the hām is the mature male camel which after completing a certain number of copulations with a female would then be consigned to their idols and be exempt from bearing any load and they would call it hāmī; but the disbelievers invent lies against God in this matter by attributing the sanctioning of such practices to Him; and most of them do not understand that this is mendacity for in this they have merely followed the example of their forefathers.
وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمْ تَعَالَوْاْ إِلَىٰ مَآ أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ وَإِلَى ٱلرَّسُولِ قَالُواْ حَسْبُنَا مَا وَجَدْنَا عَلَيْهِ آبَاءَنَآ أَوَلَوْ كَانَ آبَاؤُهُمْ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ شَيْئاً وَلاَ يَهْتَدُونَ,And when it is said to them ‘Come to what God has revealed and to the Messenger’ that is to His ruling concerning the permitting of what you have forbidden they say ‘What we have found our fathers following suffices us’ in the way of religion and laws. God exalted be He says What does that suffice them even if their fathers knew nothing and were not guided? to any truth the interrogative is meant as a disavowal.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ عَلَيْكُمْ أَنْفُسَكُمْ لاَ يَضُرُّكُمْ مَّن ضَلَّ إِذَا ٱهْتَدَيْتُمْ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ مَرْجِعُكُمْ جَمِيعاً فَيُنَبِّئُكُمْ بِمَا كُنْتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ,O you who believe you are responsible for your own souls in other words preserve them and do what is in their best interest; he who is astray cannot hurt you if you are rightly guided it is said that this means ‘None of those misguided ones from among the People of the Scripture can hurt you’; it is also said to mean others on the basis of the following hadīth of Abū Tha‘laba al-Khushanī ‘I asked the Messenger of God s about it this verse and he said “Enjoin one other to decency and forbid one another indecency and then if you see niggardliness being obeyed whims being followed this present world being preferred and every intelligent person proud of his own opinions then you are still responsible for looking after your own soul”’ as reported by al-Hākim and others. Unto God you shall return all together and He will inform you of what you used to do and requite you for it.
يَا أَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ شَهَادَةُ بَيْنِكُمْ إِذَا حَضَرَ أَحَدَكُمُ ٱلْمَوْتُ حِينَ ٱلْوَصِيَّةِ ٱثْنَانِ ذَوَا عَدْلٍ مِّنْكُمْ أَوْ آخَرَانِ مِنْ غَيْرِكُمْ إِنْ أَنتُمْ ضَرَبْتُمْ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ فَأَصَابَتْكُم مُّصِيبَةُ ٱلْمَوْتِ تَحْبِسُونَهُمَا مِن بَعْدِ ٱلصَّلاَةِ فَيُقْسِمَانِ بِٱللَّهِ إِنِ ٱرْتَبْتُمْ لاَ نَشْتَرِي بِهِ ثَمَناً وَلَوْ كَانَ ذَا قُرْبَىٰ وَلاَ نَكْتُمُ شَهَادَةَ ٱللَّهِ إِنَّآ إِذَاً لَّمِنَ ٱلآَثِمِينَ,O you who believe let testimony between you when death that is one of its causes draws near to one of you at the time of a bequest be that of two men of justice among you ithnāni dhawā ‘adlin minkum ‘two men of justice among you’ is the predicate expressed with the sense of an imperative in other words ‘let two men bear witness … etc.’; the genitive annexation of shahāda ‘testimony’ and bayn ‘between’ is meant to allow for a range of alternatives; hīn ‘at the time of’ is a substitute for idhā ‘when’ or an adverbial qualifier of time for the verb hadara ‘draws near’; or of two others from another folk that is from other than your own religious community if you are travelling in the land and the affliction of death befalls you. Then you shall empanel them you shall detain them tahbisūnahumā ‘you shall empanel them’ is an adjectival qualification of ākharān ‘two others’ after the mid-afternoon prayer and if you are in doubt if you are uncertain about it their testimony they shall swear by God both of them saying ‘We will not sell it our testimony in swearing by God for any price for any compensation that we might take in exchange for it from this world neither by swearing by Him falsely nor by testifying falsely for the sake of that price; even if he the person before whom it is being sworn or the one for whose sake testimony is being given be a near kinsman a close relative of ours nor will we hide testimony to God which He has commanded us to give for then if we were to hide it we would surely be among the sinful’.
فَإِنْ عُثِرَ عَلَىٰ أَنَّهُمَا ٱسْتَحَقَّآ إِثْماً فَآخَرَانِ يَقُومَانِ مَقَامَهُمَا مِنَ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱسْتَحَقَّ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلأَوْلَيَانِ فَيُقْسِمَانِ بِٱللَّهِ لَشَهَادَتُنَا أَحَقُّ مِن شَهَادَتِهِمَا وَمَا ٱعْتَدَيْنَآ إِنَّا إِذاً لَّمِنَ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ,But if it be discovered if it be ascertained after they have sworn their oaths that both of them have merited the suspicion of sin that is that they have done something to incur it in the way of a breach of faith or perjury in the testimony; for example if what they are accused of is found with them and then they claim that they had bought it from the deceased or that he had bequeathed it to them then two others shall take their place so that the oaths are to be taken from them being the nearest al-awlayān is a substitution for ākharān ‘two others’; a variant reading has al-awwalīn plural of awwal as an adjectival qualification of or a substitution for alladhīna ‘of those’ in kinship to the deceased of those most concerned with the bequest namely the inheritors and they shall swear by God to the breach of faith of the two witnesses and they shall both say ‘Verily our testimony our oath is truer is more faithful than their testimony their oath and we have not transgressed we have not overstepped the bounds of truth in our oaths for then we would assuredly be among the evildoers’ meaning let the one about to die call two men as witnesses to his bequest or let him instruct in his bequest that the two be from among his co-religionists or from among others if he cannot find any from among the former because he is travelling or for some similar reason. If the inheritors have doubts about the two men and claim a breach of faith on the part of the two for having taken something or given it to some other person — alleging that the deceased bequeathed it to him — then let the two men swear in full in the way mentioned above. If then some indication surfaces that the two men have been lying and these two then claim some motivation for this action of theirs the nearest of the inheritors in kinship to the deceased shall swear to the perjury of the two men and to the truth of what they the inheritors suspected. This stipulation holds for the two trustees but is abrogated in the case of the two witnesses. Likewise the testimony of non co-religionists is abrogated.
ذٰلِكَ أَدْنَىٰ أَن يَأْتُواْ بِٱلشَّهَادَةِ عَلَىٰ وَجْهِهَآ أَوْ يَخَافُوۤاْ أَن تُرَدَّ أَيْمَانٌ بَعْدَ أَيْمَانِهِمْ وَٱتَّقُوا ٱللَّهَ وَٱسْمَعُواْ وَٱللَّهُ لاَ يَهْدِي ٱلْقَوْمَ ٱلْفَاسِقِينَ,That ruling mentioned where the oath devolves to the inheritors makes it likelier brings closer the eventuality that they the witnesses or the trustees will bear the testimony in its true form the form in which they have been charged to bear it without distortion or breach of faith or it is likelier that they will be afraid that after their oaths other oaths may be taken from the inheritors the plaintiffs who would swear to the two men’s breach of faith or perjury in which case they would be disgraced and would incur penalties and so because of this they will not lie. Fear God by refraining from betrayal and perjury and listen to what you have been commanded listening in acceptance. God does not guide the wicked people those rebelling against obedience to Him; He does not guide the wicked to the way of goodness.
يَوْمَ يَجْمَعُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلرُّسُلَ فَيَقُولُ مَاذَآ أُجِبْتُمْ قَالُواْ لاَ عِلْمَ لَنَآ إِنَّكَ أَنتَ عَلاَّمُ ٱلْغُيُوبِ,Mention the day when God shall gather the messengers which is the Day of Resurrection and He will say to them as a rebuke for their peoples ‘What answer were you given?’ when you summoned them to proclaim God’s Oneness; they shall say ‘We have no knowledge of this; You only You are the Knower of things unseen’ those things which are hidden from God’s servants and that which they the messengers have forgotten all knowledge of on account of the great terror of the Day of Resurrection and their fright; but when they have calmed down they proceed to bear witness against their communities.
إِذْ قَالَ ٱللَّهُ يٰعِيسَى ٱبْنَ مَرْيَمَ ٱذْكُرْ نِعْمَتِي عَلَيْكَ وَعَلَىٰ وَالِدَتِكَ إِذْ أَيَّدتُّكَ بِرُوحِ ٱلْقُدُسِ تُكَلِّمُ ٱلنَّاسَ فِي ٱلْمَهْدِ وَكَهْلاً وَإِذْ عَلَّمْتُكَ ٱلْكِتَابَ وَٱلْحِكْمَةَ وَٱلتَّوْرَاةَ وَٱلإِنْجِيلَ وَإِذْ تَخْلُقُ مِنَ ٱلطِّينِ كَهَيْئَةِ ٱلطَّيْرِ بِإِذْنِي فَتَنفُخُ فِيهَا فَتَكُونُ طَيْراً بِإِذْنِي وَتُبْرِىءُ ٱلأَكْمَهَ وَٱلأَبْرَصَ بِإِذْنِي وَإِذْ تُخْرِجُ ٱلْمَوتَىٰ بِإِذْنِيِ وَإِذْ كَفَفْتُ بَنِيۤ إِسْرَائِيلَ عَنكَ إِذْ جِئْتَهُمْ بِٱلْبَيِّنَاتِ فَقَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِنْهُمْ إِنْ هَـٰذَا إِلاَّ سِحْرٌ مُّبِينٌ,Mention when God said ‘O Jesus son of Mary remember My favour to you and to your mother be thankful for it; when I strengthened you with the Holy Spirit Gabriel to speak to people tukallimu’l-nāsa is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the suffixed pronoun kāf in ayyadtu-ka in the cradle that is as a child and in maturity — this implies that he will descend before the Hour since he was raised up to God before middle age as has already been mentioned in sūrat Āl ‘Imrān Q. 355 and when I taught you the Scripture and wisdom and the Torah and the Gospel; and how you create out of clay the likeness ka-hay’at the kāf here functions like a noun and is a direct object the image of a bird by My permission and you breathe into it and it becomes a bird by My permission by My will and you heal the blind and the leper by My permission and you raise the dead from their graves back to life by My permission; and how I restrained the Children of Israel from you when they intended to kill you when you brought them clear proofs miracles and the disbelievers among them said “This what you have done is nothing but manifest sorcery” a variant reading for sihrun ‘sorcery’ has sāhirun ‘sorcerer’ in other words he Jesus is nothing but a manifest sorcerer.
وَإِذْ أَوْحَيْتُ إِلَى ٱلْحَوَارِيِّينَ أَنْ آمِنُواْ بِي وَبِرَسُولِي قَالُوۤاْ آمَنَّا وَٱشْهَدْ بِأَنَّنَا مُسْلِمُونَ,And when I revealed to the disciples when I commanded them by the tongue of Jesus “Believe in Me and in My Messenger” Jesus; they said “We believe in both; bear witness that we have submitted”.’
إِذْ قَالَ ٱلْحَوَارِيُّونَ يٰعِيسَى ٱبْنَ مَرْيَمَ هَلْ يَسْتَطِيعُ رَبُّكَ أَن يُنَزِّلَ عَلَيْنَا مَآئِدَةً مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ قَالَ ٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ إِن كُنْتُم مُّؤْمِنِينَ,Mention when the disciples said ‘O Jesus son of Mary is your Lord able that is would He a variant reading has hal tastatī‘a rabbaka ‘Are you able to ask of Him?’ to send down on us a Table from the heaven?’ He Jesus said to them ‘Fear God when you request signs if you are believers’.
قَالُواْ نُرِيدُ أَن نَّأْكُلَ مِنْهَا وَتَطْمَئِنَّ قُلُوبُنَا وَنَعْلَمَ أَن قَدْ صَدَقْتَنَا وَنَكُونَ عَلَيْهَا مِنَ ٱلشَّاهِدِينَ,They said ‘We desire to request this in order to eat of it and that our hearts be reassured through increased certainty and that we may know that we may acquire more awareness of the fact that you annaka is softened to an have spoken truthfully to us in your claim to prophethood and that we may be among the witnesses thereof’.
قَالَ عِيسَى ٱبْنُ مَرْيَمَ ٱللَّهُمَّ رَبَّنَآ أَنزِلْ عَلَيْنَا مَآئِدَةً مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ تَكُونُ لَنَا عِيداً لأَوَّلِنَا وَآخِرِنَا وَآيَةً مِّنْكَ وَٱرْزُقْنَا وَأَنتَ خَيْرُ ٱلرَّازِقِينَ,Jesus son of Mary said ‘O God our Lord send down upon us a Table from the heaven that it shall be that is the day of its sending down shall be a celebration for us which we shall consecrate and honour for the first li-awwalinā is an inclusive substitution for lanā ‘for us’ with the repetition of the oblique preposition li- and the last of us those who will come after us and a sign from You of Your power and my prophethood. And provide it for us; You are the Best of Providers’.
قَالَ ٱللَّهُ إِنِّي مُنَزِّلُهَا عَلَيْكُمْ فَمَن يَكْفُرْ بَعْدُ مِنكُمْ فَإِنِّيۤ أُعَذِّبُهُ عَذَاباً لاَّ أُعَذِّبُهُ أَحَداً مِّنَ ٱلْعَالَمِينَ,God said granting his supplication ‘Verily I shall send it down read munziluhā or munazziluhā to you; but whoever of you disbelieves afterward after it has been sent down I shall surely chastise him with a chastisement wherewith I chastise no other being from among all the worlds’ and so the angels descended with it from heaven on it were seven loaves and seven large fish and so they ate of it until they were full as related by Ibn ‘Abbās. In one hadīth it is said that the Table sent down from heaven consisted of bread and meat and they were commanded not to be treacherous and nor to store anything for the next day but they were and they stored some of it and were consequently transformed into apes and swine.
وَإِذْ قَالَ ٱللَّهُ يٰعِيسَى ٱبْنَ مَرْيَمَ أَأَنتَ قُلتَ لِلنَّاسِ ٱتَّخِذُونِي وَأُمِّيَ إِلَـٰهَيْنِ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ قَالَ سُبْحَانَكَ مَا يَكُونُ لِيۤ أَنْ أَقُولَ مَا لَيْسَ لِي بِحَقٍّ إِن كُنتُ قُلْتُهُ فَقَدْ عَلِمْتَهُ تَعْلَمُ مَا فِي نَفْسِي وَلاَ أَعْلَمُ مَا فِي نَفْسِكَ إِنَّكَ أَنتَ عَلاَّمُ ٱلْغُيُوبِ,And mention when God says that is when God will say to Jesus at the Resurrection in rebuke of his followers ‘O Jesus son of Mary did you say to mankind “Take me and my mother as gods besides God”?’ He Jesus says shuddering ‘Glory be to You! exalted be You above all that does not befit You such as having a partner and so on. It is not mine it is unjustified for me to say what I have no right to bi-haqq ‘right to’ is the predicate of laysa ‘not’; lī ‘mine’ is explicative. If I indeed had said it You would have known it. You know what is hidden by me in my self but I do not know what is within Your Self that is what You keep hidden of Your knowledge You are the Knower of things unseen.
مَا قُلْتُ لَهُمْ إِلاَّ مَآ أَمَرْتَنِي بِهِ أَنِ ٱعْبُدُواْ ٱللَّهَ رَبِّي وَرَبَّكُمْ وَكُنتُ عَلَيْهِمْ شَهِيداً مَّا دُمْتُ فِيهِمْ فَلَمَّا تَوَفَّيْتَنِي كُنتَ أَنتَ الرَّقِيبَ عَلَيْهِمْ وَأَنتَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ شَهِيدٌ,I only said to them that which You commanded me to say and that is “Worship God my Lord and your Lord.” And I was a witness a watcher over them preventing them from saying what they used to say whilst I was amongst them; but when You took me to You when You raised me up to the heaven You were Yourself the Watcher over them the Observer of their deeds and You Yourself are Witness over all things Aware and knowing them including what I said to them and what they said after me and whatever else.
إِن تُعَذِّبْهُمْ فَإِنَّهُمْ عِبَادُكَ وَإِن تَغْفِرْ لَهُمْ فَإِنَّكَ أَنتَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ,If you chastise them that is those among them who are fixed upon disbelief verily they are Your servants and You are their Master disposing of them as You will there can be no objection to what You do; and if You forgive them that is those of them who are believers You only You are the Mighty in His affair the Wise’ in His actions.
قَالَ ٱللَّهُ هَـٰذَا يَوْمُ يَنفَعُ ٱلصَّادِقِينَ صِدْقُهُمْ لَهُمْ جَنَّاتٌ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلأَنْهَارُ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَآ أَبَداً رَّضِيَ ٱللَّهُ عَنْهُمْ وَرَضُواْ عَنْهُ ذٰلِكَ ٱلْفَوْزُ ٱلْعَظِيمُ,God says ‘This namely the Day of Resurrection is the day those who were truthful in the world like Jesus shall profit by their truthfulness because this is the Day of Requital. Theirs will be Gardens underneath which rivers flow wherein they shall abide forever. God is well-pleased with them because of their obedience to Him and they are well-pleased with Him with His reward — that is the great triumph’. The sincerity of those who were liars in this world shall not avail them on that Day just as it shall not avail the disbelievers when they believe upon seeing the chastisement.
للَّهِ مُلْكُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَمَا فِيهِنَّ وَهُوَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,To God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth the storehouses of rain vegetation sustenance and everything else and all that is in them wa-mā fīhinna the use of mā ‘that’ indicates the predominance of all those non-rational creations; and He has power over all things including the rewarding of the truthful and the punishing of the liar — He is specifically addressing rational beings for there is none among them with power over all things.
ٱلْحَمْدُ للَّهِ ٱلَّذِي خَلَقَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضَ وَجَعَلَ ٱلظُّلُمَٰتِ وَٱلنُّورَ ثْمَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ بِرَبِّهِمْ يَعْدِلُونَ,Praise which means to describe in beautiful terms be ever established to God is this meant to be informative so that one believes in it? Or is it meant as a eulogy or both? These are three possibilities the most likely of which is the last as the Shaykh Jalāl al-Dīn al-Mahallī states in his commentary on sūrat al-Kahf Q. 181; Who created the heavens and the earth — He singles out these two for mention because for the observer they constitute the most awesome visible creation; and He appointed He created darknesses and light that is every darkness zulma and every light the use of the plural only in the case of the former is because it darkness has many causes; and this is one of the proofs of His Oneness; then those who disbelieve despite the existence of this proof ascribe equals to their Lord they worship others equally.
هُوَ ٱلَّذِي خَلَقَكُمْ مِّن طِينٍ ثُمَّ قَضَىۤ أَجَلاً وَأَجَلٌ مُّسَمًّى عِندَهُ ثُمَّ أَنتُمْ تَمْتَرُونَ,It is He Who created you from clay by creating your father Adam from it; then He decreed a term for each of you at the conclusion of which you die. A term is stated fixed with Him for your resurrection; yet thereafter you O disbelievers doubt you are uncertain about the Resurrection when you know that it was He Who initiated your creation and One Who has the power to initiate creation is even more capable of bringing you back to life after death.
وَهُوَ ٱللَّهُ فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَفِي ٱلأَرْضِ يَعْلَمُ سِرَّكُمْ وَجَهْرَكُمْ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا تَكْسِبُونَ,He is God the One worthy of being worshipped in the heavens and in the earth. He knows your secrets and your utterance what you keep secret and what you utter openly among yourselves and He knows what you earn what you do of good and evil.
وَمَا تَأْتِيهِم مِّنْ آيَةٍ مِّنْ آيَٰتِ رَبِّهِمْ إِلاَّ كَانُواْ عَنْهَا مُعْرِضِينَ,Not a verse min āya min introduces a relative clause of the verses of their Lord in the Qur’ān comes to them that is to the Meccans but they turn away from it.
فَقَدْ كَذَّبُواْ بِٱلْحَقِّ لَمَّا جَآءَهُمْ فَسَوْفَ يَأْتِيهِمْ أَنْبَاءُ مَا كَانُواْ بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ,They denied the truth the Qur’ān when it came to them but there shall come to them the news the consequences of what they were mocking.
أَلَمْ يَرَوْاْ كَمْ أَهْلَكْنَا مِن قَبْلِهِم مِّن قَرْنٍ مَّكَّنَّٰهُمْ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ مَا لَمْ نُمَكِّن لَّكُمْ وَأَرْسَلْنَا ٱلسَّمَآءَ عَلَيْهِم مِّدْرَاراً وَجَعَلْنَا ٱلأَنْهَارَ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهِمْ فَأَهْلَكْنَٰهُمْ بِذُنُوبِهِمْ وَأَنْشَأْنَا مِن بَعْدِهِمْ قَرْناً آخَرِينَ,Have they not seen in their travels to Syria and to other places how many kam is predicative and not interrogative meaning ‘many’ a generation how many a community of past communities We destroyed before them; We established them We assigned them an established place in the earth through strength and abundance as We have not established as We have not assigned you there is a shift in the address here from third person to second; and how We unleashed the heaven the rain upon them in torrents one torrent after another and made the rivers to flow beneath them? beneath their dwellings. Then We destroyed them because of their sins because of their denial of the prophets; and We raised up after them another generation.
وَلَوْ نَزَّلْنَا عَلَيْكَ كِتَٰباً فِي قِرْطَاسٍ فَلَمَسُوهُ بِأَيْدِيهِمْ لَقَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ إِنْ هَـٰذَآ إِلاَّ سِحْرٌ مُّبِينٌ,And had We revealed to you a Scripture inscribed on parchment as they requested and had they then touched it with their hands — this is more powerful than saying ‘had they seen it with their eyes’ since it touch is more effective in eliminating doubt; the disbelievers would have said in disobedience and obduracy ‘This is nothing but manifest sorcery’.
وَقَالُواْ لَوْلاۤ أُنزِلَ عَلَيْهِ مَلَكٌ وَلَوْ أَنزَلْنَا مَلَكاً لَّقُضِيَ ٱلأَمْرُ ثُمَّ لاَ يُنظَرُونَ,And they say ‘Why has an angel not been sent down to him?’ to Muhammad (s) to confirm his truthfulness; yet had We sent down an angel as they have requested and if they then did not believe the matter that they be destroyed would have been decreed and then they would not be given any respite they would not be given any extra time for repentance or an excuse as is God’s custom in dealing with those before them destroying them when they disbelieve after their request is granted.
وَلَوْ جَعَلْنَٰهُ مَلَكاً لَّجَعَلْنَٰهُ رَجُلاً وَلَلَبَسْنَا عَلَيْهِم مَّا يَلْبِسُونَ,And had We appointed him the one who is sent down to them an angel We would assuredly have made him the angel a man that is We would have sent him in the form of a man so that they would be able to see him since no human being is capable of seeing an angel; and had We sent him down and made him a man We would have assuredly confused obscured for them what they are confusing for themselves when they say ‘This is but a mere mortal like the rest of you’.
وَلَقَدِ ٱسْتُهْزِىءَ بِرُسُلٍ مِّن قَبْلِكَ فَحَاقَ بِٱلَّذِينَ سَخِرُواْ مِنْهُمْ مَّا كَانُواْ بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ,And messengers were indeed mocked before you — this is meant as a consolation for the Prophet s — but those who scoffed at them were encompassed by that which they mocked namely by the punishment sent down on them those who mock you will be encompassed likewise.
قُلْ سِيرُواْ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ ثُمَّ ٱنْظُرُواْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَٰقِبَةُ ٱلْمُكَذِّبِينَ,Say to them ‘Travel in the land and see the nature of the consequence for the deniers’ of the messengers how they were destroyed through chastisement; perhaps they will take heed.
قُل لِّمَن مَّا فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ قُل للَّهِ كَتَبَ عَلَىٰ نَفْسِهِ ٱلرَّحْمَةَ لَيَجْمَعَنَّكُمْ إِلَىٰ يَوْمِ ٱلْقِيَٰمَةِ لاَ رَيْبَ فِيهِ ٱلَّذِينَ خَسِرُوۤاْ أَنْفُسَهُمْ فَهُمْ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ,Say ‘To whom belongs what is in the heavens and in the earth?’ Say ‘To God for even if they do not say this there is no other response. He has prescribed He has decreed for Himself mercy as a bounty from Him — this is a gentle summoning of them to the faith. He will surely gather you together on the Day of Resurrection of which there is no doubt no uncertainty in order to requite you for your deeds. Those who have forfeited their own souls this is the subject — by exposing them to the chastisement — they do not believe this is the predicate.
وَلَهُ مَا سَكَنَ فِي ٱلْلَّيْلِ وَٱلنَّهَارِ وَهُوَ ٱلسَّمِيعُ ٱلْعَلِيمُ,And to Him exalted be He belongs all that inhabits resides in the night and the day that is to say everything — He is its Lord its Creator and its Possessor; and He is the Hearer of what is said the Knower’ of what is done.
قُلْ أَغَيْرَ ٱللَّهِ أَتَّخِذُ وَلِيّاً فَاطِرِ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَهُوَ يُطْعِمُ وَلاَ يُطْعَمُ قُلْ إِنِّيۤ أُمِرْتُ أَنْ أَكُونَ أَوَّلَ مَنْ أَسْلَمَ وَلاَ تَكُونَنَّ مِنَ ٱلْمُشْرِكَينَ,Say to them ‘Shall I take as a protector to worship other than God the Originator of the heavens and the earth the One Who has created them without any precedent He Who feeds Who gives sustenance and is not fed?’ and is not given sustenance. Say ‘I have been commanded to be the first to submit to God from among this community and it was said to me “Do not be among those who associate others” ’ with Him.
قُلْ إِنِّيۤ أَخَافُ إِنْ عَصَيْتُ رَبِّي عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ,Say ‘Indeed I fear if I should rebel against my Lord by worshipping other than Him the chastisement of a dreadful day’ namely the Day of Resurrection.
مَّن يُصْرَفْ عَنْهُ يَوْمَئِذٍ فَقَدْ رَحِمَهُ وَذَلِكَ ٱلْفَوْزُ ٱلْمُبِينُ,He from whom it is averted read passive yusraf ‘it is averted’ namely ‘the chastisement’; or read active yasrif ‘He averts’ namely ‘God’ as the subject; the referential noun has been omitted on that day He the Exalted One will have had mercy on him He will have desired good for him; that is the manifest triumph evident salvation.
وَإِن يَمْسَسْكَ ٱللَّهُ بِضُرٍّ فَلاَ كَاشِفَ لَهُ إِلاَّ هُوَ وَإِن يَمْسَسْكَ بِخَيْرٍ فَهُوَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدُيرٌ,And if God touches you with an affliction a trial such as an illness or impoverishment then none can remove it none can lift it except Him; and if He touches you with good such as health and affluence then He has power over all things including His touching you with this and none other than Him has the power to remove it from you.
وَهُوَ ٱلْقَاهِرُ فَوْقَ عِبَادِهِ وَهُوَ ٱلْحَكِيمُ ٱلْخَبِيرُ,He is the Vanquisher the Omnipotent for Whom nothing is impossible Superior is He over His servants and He is the Wise in His creation the Aware of their innermost thoughts as well as their outward actions.
قُلْ أَيُّ شَيْءٍ أَكْبَرُ شَهَٰدةً قُلِ ٱللَّهُ شَهِيدٌ بِيْنِي وَبَيْنَكُمْ وَأُوحِيَ إِلَيَّ هَـٰذَا ٱلْقُرْآنُ لأُنذِرَكُمْ بِهِ وَمَن بَلَغَ أَئِنَّكُمْ لَتَشْهَدُونَ أَنَّ مَعَ ٱللَّهِ ءَالِهَةً أُخْرَىٰ قُل لاَّ أَشْهَدُ قُلْ إِنَّمَا هُوَ إِلَـٰهٌ وَاحِدٌ وَإِنَّنِي بَرِيءٌ مِّمَّا تُشْرِكُونَ,When they said to the Prophet s ‘Bring us someone to testify to the truth of your prophethood for the People of the Scripture have denied you’ the following was revealed Say to them ‘What thing is greatest in testimony?’ shahādatan this is for specification and is derived from the implied subject of the sentence. Say ‘God — even if they do not say this there is no other response — He is Witness between me and you to my truthfulness; and this Qur’ān has been revealed to me that I may warn you that I may make you fear O people of Mecca thereby and whomever it may reach wa-man balagha this is a supplement to the suffixed pronoun ‘you’ of undhira-kum ‘I may warn you’ that is to say whomever among men and jinn the Qur’ān may reach. Do you indeed bear witness that there are other gods with God?’ this interrogative is meant as a disavowal. Say to them ‘I do not bear witness’ to this. Say ‘He is only One God and I am innocent of what you associate’ with Him of idols.
ٱلَّذِينَ آتَيْنَاهُمُ ٱلْكِتَابَ يَعْرِفُونَهُ كَمَا يَعْرِفُونَ أَبْنَآءَهُمُ ٱلَّذِينَ خَسِرُوۤاْ أَنْفُسَهُمْ فَهُمْ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ,Those to whom We have given the Scripture recognise him that is Muhammad (s) by the descriptions of him in their Scripture as they recognise their sons; those of them who have forfeited their own souls do not believe in him.
وَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّنِ ٱفْتَرَىٰ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ كَذِباً أَوْ كَذَّبَ بِآيَٰتِهِ إِنَّهُ لاَ يُفْلِحُ ٱلظَّٰلِمُونَ,And who that is none does greater evil than he who invents a lie against God by ascribing to Him an associate or denies His signs? the Qur’ān; it is verily the case that they the evildoers shall not prosper on account of this.
وَيَوْمَ نَحْشُرُهُمْ جَمِيعاً ثُمَّ نَقُولُ لِلَّذِينَ أَشْرَكُواْ أَيْنَ شُرَكَآؤُكُمُ ٱلَّذِينَ كُنتُمْ تَزْعُمُونَ,And mention on the day We shall gather them all together then We shall say in rebuke to those who associated other gods with God ‘Where are those associates of yours whom you were claiming?’ to be associates of God?
ثُمَّ لَمْ تَكُنْ فِتْنَتُهُمْ إِلاَّ أَن قَالُواْ وَٱللَّهِ رَبِّنَا مَا كُنَّا مُشْرِكِينَ,Then their dissension read accusative fitnatahum or nominative fitnatuhum their apology was read lam takun or lam yakun only to say in other words was only their saying ‘By God our Lord read rabbinā as an adjective of wa’Llāhi ‘by God’ or rabbanā as a vocative we were never idolaters’.
ٱنظُرْ كَيْفَ كَذَبُواْ عَلَىٰ أَنفُسِهِمْ وَضَلَّ عَنْهُمْ مَّا كَانُواْ يَفْتَرُونَ,God exalted be He says See O Muhammad (s) how they lie against themselves by denying that their idolatry and how that which they were forging against God in the way of associates has failed is absent before them!
وَمِنْهُمْ مَّن يَسْتَمِعُ إِلَيْكَ وَجَعَلْنَا عَلَىٰ قُلُوبِهِمْ أَكِنَّةً أَن يَفْقَهُوهُ وَفِيۤ ءَاذَانِهِمْ وَقْراً وَإِن يَرَوْاْ كُلَّ ءَايَةٍ لاَّ يُؤْمِنُواْ بِهَا حَتَّىٰ إِذَا جَآءُوكَ يُجَٰدِلُونَكَ يَقُولُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوۤاْ إِنْ هَـٰذَآ إِلاَّ أَسَٰطِيرُ ٱلأَوَّلِينَ,And there are some of them who listen to you when you recite and We have placed veils covers upon their hearts so that they do not understand it so that they do not comprehend the Qur’ān; and in their ears a heaviness a deafness so that they do not hear it with a willingness to accept it. And if they were to see every sign they would not believe in it so that when they come to you to argue with you the disbelievers say ‘This Qur’ān is nothing but the fables the lies of the ancients’ similar to their jokes and strange tales asātīr ‘fables’ is the plural of ustūra.
وَهُمْ يَنْهَوْنَ عَنْهُ وَيَنْأَوْنَ عَنْهُ وَإِن يُهْلِكُونَ إِلاَّ أَنفُسَهُمْ وَمَا يَشْعُرُونَ,And to people they forbid it the following of the Prophet s and keep away from it and so they do not believe in him it is said that this was revealed regarding Abū Tālib who used to forbid people from hurting him but did not himself believe in him; and it is only themselves they destroy when they keep away from him because the harm thereof will befall them but they do not perceive this.
وَلَوْ تَرَىٰ إِذْ وُقِفُواْ عَلَى ٱلنَّارِ فَقَالُواْ يٰلَيْتَنَا نُرَدُّ وَلاَ نُكَذِّبَ بِآيَٰتِ رَبِّنَا وَنَكُونَ مِنَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,If you O Muhammad (s) could see when they are made to stand when they are exposed before the Fire and they say ‘Oh yā is for exclamation would that we might be returned to the world; then we would not deny the signs of our Lord but we would be among the believers!’ read nukadhdhibu and nakūnu as a new independent sentence; or read nukadhdhiba and nakūna as the subjunctive response to the optative clause; or read nukadhdhibu and nakūna. The response to the clause ‘if you could see’ would be ‘you would be seeing a terrible thing indeed’.
بَلْ بَدَا لَهُمْ مَّا كَانُواْ يُخْفُونَ مِن قَبْلُ وَلَوْ رُدُّواْ لَعَادُواْ لِمَا نُهُواْ عَنْهُ وَإِنَّهُمْ لَكَاذِبُونَ,God exalted be He says Nay — here used in order to reject the desire to believe implied by the optative exclamation — that which they used to conceal to hide before by their saying By God our Lord we were never idolaters! Q. 623 has now become evident to them as their limbs have borne witness against them and so they now wish for that mentioned in the previous verse; and even if hypothetically they were returned to the world they would return to that which they are forbidden of idolatry; they are truly liars when they promise that they would believe if they were to be returned.
وَقَالُوۤاْ إِنْ هِيَ إِلاَّ حَيَاتُنَا ٱلدُّنْيَا وَمَا نَحْنُ بِمَبْعُوثِينَ,And they those who deny the Resurrection say ‘There is no other life than our present life; we shall not be resurrected’.
وَلَوْ تَرَىٰ إِذْ وُقِفُواْ عَلَىٰ رَبِّهِمْ قَالَ أَلَيْسَ هَـٰذَا بِٱلْحَقِّ قَالُواْ بَلَىٰ وَرَبِّنَا قَالَ فَذُوقُواْ ٱلعَذَابَ بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَكْفُرُونَ,If you could see when they are made to stand when they are presented before their Lord you would certainly see an awesome thing! He will say to them by the tongue of the angels in rebuke ‘Is this resurrection and reckoning not the truth?’ They will say ‘Yes indeed by our Lord’ it is the truth! He will say ‘Then taste the chastisement because you disbelieved’ during life on earth.
قَدْ خَسِرَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَذَّبُواْ بِلِقَآءِ ٱللَّهِ حَتَّىٰ إِذَا جَآءَتْهُمُ ٱلسَّاعَةُ بَغْتَةً قَالُواْ يٰحَسْرَتَنَا عَلَىٰ مَا فَرَّطْنَا فِيهَا وَهُمْ يَحْمِلُونَ أَوْزَارَهُمْ عَلَىٰ ظُهُورِهِمْ أَلاَ سَآءَ مَا يَزِرُونَ,They indeed are losers who deny the encounter with God through resurrection until hattā is purposive to expose the extent of their mendacity when the Hour the Resurrection comes upon them suddenly they shall say ‘Alas for us yā hasratanā ‘O grief of ours’ expresses extreme suffering the vocative call to which is figurative meaning ‘Now is the time for you O grief so come forth!’ that we neglected it!’ the worldly life. On their backs they shall be bearing their burdens so that these come to them at the Resurrection in the vilest of forms and with the most putrid of smells and they ride them. Ah evil is that burden of theirs which they bear!
وَمَا ٱلْحَيَٰوةُ ٱلدُّنْيَآ إِلاَّ لَعِبٌ وَلَهْوٌ وَلَلدَّارُ ٱلآخِرَةُ خَيْرٌ لِّلَّذِينَ يَتَّقُونَ أَفَلاَ تَعْقِلُونَ,The life of this world that is preoccupation with it is nothing but a game and a diversion while obedience and what is conducive to it are of the things of the Hereafter; surely the abode of the Hereafter wa-la’l-dāru is also read wa-la-dāru’l-ākhirati namely Paradise is better for those who fear idolatry. What do they not understand? this and so believe? read a-fa-lā ya‘qilūna ‘do they not understand’ or a-fa-lā ta‘qilūna ‘do you not understand?’.
قَدْ نَعْلَمُ إِنَّهُ لَيَحْزُنُكَ ٱلَّذِي يَقُولُونَ فَإِنَّهُمْ لاَ يُكَذِّبُونَكَ وَلَـٰكِنَّ ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ بِآيَاتِ ٱللَّهِ يَجْحَدُونَ,We know indeed qad is a confirmative particle that it grieves you that matter which they say to you in denial; yet it is not that they deny you in secret for they know that you are truthful a variant reading for lā yukadhdhibūnaka ‘not that they deny you’ has lā yukdhibūnak that is to say ‘they do not associate you with mendacity’ but evildoers al-zālimīn replaces the previous pronominalisation ‘they’ knowingly reject deny the signs of God the Qur’ān.
وَلَقَدْ كُذِّبَتْ رُسُلٌ مِّن قَبْلِكَ فَصَبَرُواْ عَلَىٰ مَا كُذِّبُواْ وَأُوذُواْ حَتَّىٰ أَتَاهُمْ نَصْرُنَا وَلاَ مُبَدِّلَ لِكَلِمَاتِ ٱللَّهِ وَلَقدْ جَآءَكَ مِن نَّبَإِ ٱلْمُرْسَلِينَ,Messengers indeed have been denied before you — herein is a consolation for the Prophet s — yet they endured patiently the denial and the persecution until Our victorious help came to them through the destruction of their peoples so be patient until the victorious help comes to you through the destruction of your people. There is none to change the words of God His promises and there has already come to you tidings of the messengers tidings through which your heart can be at peace.
وَإِن كَانَ كَبُرَ عَلَيْكَ إِعْرَاضُهُمْ فَإِن ٱسْتَطَعْتَ أَن تَبْتَغِيَ نَفَقاً فِي ٱلأَرْضِ أَوْ سُلَّماً فِي ٱلسَّمَآءِ فَتَأْتِيَهُمْ بِآيَةٍ وَلَوْ شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ لَجَمَعَهُمْ عَلَى ٱلْهُدَىٰ فَلاَ تَكُونَنَّ مِنَ ٱلْجَٰهِلِينَ,And if their aversion to Islam is grievous too great for you on account of your concern for them then if you can seek out a hole an underground passage in the earth or a ladder a stairway to heaven that you may bring them a sign from among those they have requested then go ahead the meaning is that you will not be able to do this so be patient until God delivers His judgement — but had God willed to guide them He would have gathered them together in guidance but He did not will this and so they do not believe; so do not be among the ignorant of this matter.
إِنَّمَا يَسْتَجِيبُ ٱلَّذِينَ يَسْمَعُونَ وَٱلْمَوْتَىٰ يَبْعَثُهُمُ ٱللَّهُ ثُمَّ إِلَيْهِ يُرْجَعُونَ,Only those who hear in such a way so as to understand and take heed will answer your call to faith; as for the dead that is the disbelievers — they are likened to them on account of their inability to hear — God will resurrect them in the Hereafter and then to Him they will be returned and He will requite them for their deeds.
وَقَالُواْ لَوْلاَ نُزِّلَ عَلَيْهِ آيَةٌ مِّن رَّبِّهِ قُلْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ قَادِرٌ عَلَىٰ أَن يُنَزِّلٍ آيَةً وَلَـٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَهُمْ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ,And they the disbelievers of Mecca say ‘Why has a sign not been sent down to him from his Lord?’ a sign such as the she-camel of the prophet Sālih or the staff of Moses or the Table of Jesus. Say to them ‘Surely God has the power to send down read yunazzil or yunzil a sign from among those they have requested but most of them do not know’ that its sending down would be a trial for them for if they then still denied it they would necessarily be destroyed.
وَمَا مِن دَآبَّةٍ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَلاَ طَائِرٍ يَطِيرُ بِجَنَاحَيْهِ إِلاَّ أُمَمٌ أَمْثَالُكُمْ مَّا فَرَّطْنَا فِي ٱلكِتَٰبِ مِن شَيْءٍ ثُمَّ إِلَىٰ رَبِّهِمْ يُحْشَرُونَ,There is no mā min min is extra animal that crawls on the earth and no bird that flies through the air with its wings but they are communities like to you in the way that its creation has been ordained together with its sustenance and affairs. We have neglected nothing min shay’ min is extra in the Book in the Preserved Tablet al-lawh al-mahfūz nothing that We have not written; then to their Lord they shall be gathered and judgement shall be passed upon them and the hornless sheep shall retaliate against the horned ram and then it will be said to them the animals ‘Be dust’.
وَٱلَّذِينَ كَذَّبُواْ بِآيَاتِنَا صُمٌّ وَبُكْمٌ فِي ٱلظُّلُمَاتِ مَن يَشَإِ ٱللَّهُ يُضْلِلْهُ وَمَن يَشَأْ يَجْعَلْهُ عَلَىٰ صِرَاطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ,And those who deny Our signs the Qur’ān are deaf to hearing them in such a way so as to accept them and dumb unable to utter truth in darkness in unbelief. He whom God wills to send astray He sends astray and whom He wills to guide He sets him on a straight path a straight road the religion of Islam.
قُلْ أَرَءَيْتَكُمْ إِنْ أَتَـٰكُمْ عَذَابُ ٱللَّهِ أَوْ أَتَتْكُمُ ٱلسَّاعَةُ أَغَيْرَ ٱللَّهِ تَدْعُونَ إِن كُنتُمْ صَـٰدِقِينَ,Say O Muhammad (s) to the Meccans ‘Do you see yourselves that is inform me if God’s chastisement comes upon you in this world or the Hour the Resurrection which includes this chastisement comes upon you suddenly will ye call upon any other than God? No! If you speak truly!’ that the idols can benefit you then call upon them.
بَلْ إِيَّاهُ تَدْعُونَ فَيَكْشِفُ مَا تَدْعُونَ إِلَيْهِ إِنْ شَآءَ وَتَنسَوْنَ مَا تُشْرِكُونَ,Nay; upon Him and upon none other you will call in times of tribulation and He will remove that which you call upon Him to remove from you such things as suffering if He wills to remove it and you will forget you will neglect what you associate with Him of idols and will not call them.
وَلَقَدْ أَرْسَلنَآ إِلَىٰ أُمَمٍ مِّن قَبْلِكَ فَأَخَذْنَٰهُمْ بِٱلْبَأْسَآءِ وَٱلضَّرَّآءِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَضَرَّعُونَ,Indeed We sent to communities before you min qablika min is extra messengers but they denied them and We seized them with misery abject poverty and hardship illness so that they might be humble abased that they might believe.
فَلَوْلاۤ إِذْ جَآءَهُمْ بَأْسُنَا تَضَرَّعُواْ وَلَـٰكِن قَسَتْ قُلُوبُهُمْ وَزَيَّنَ لَهُمُ ٱلشَّيْطَانُ مَا كَانُواّ يَعْمَلُونَ,If only when Our might Our punishment came upon them they had been humble in other words they were not so even though the necessitating factor was there. But their hearts were hard and would not yield to faith and Satan adorned for them what they were doing in the way of disobedient acts and so they persisted in them.
فَلَمَّا نَسُواْ مَا ذُكِّرُواْ بِهِ فَتَحْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ أَبْوَابَ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ حَتَّىٰ إِذَا فَرِحُواْ بِمَآ أُوتُوۤاْ أَخَذْنَاهُمْ بَغْتَةً فَإِذَا هُمْ مُّبْلِسُونَ,So when they forgot when they neglected that whereof they were reminded that with which they were admonished and threatened in the way of misery and hardship; and they did not heed the admonition We opened read fatahnā or fattahnā to them the gates of all things in the way of graces in order to draw them on by degrees until when they rejoiced in what they were given a wanton rejoicing We seized them suddenly with chastisement and lo! they were confounded despairing of anything good.
فَقُطِعَ دَابِرُ ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ وَٱلْحَمْدُ للَّهِ رَبِّ ٱلْعَالَمِينَ,So the last remnant of the people who did evil was cut off by having them annihilated. Praise be to God Lord of the Worlds for giving victory to the messengers and destroying the disbelievers.
قُلْ أَرَأَيْتُمْ إِنْ أَخَذَ ٱللَّهُ سَمْعَكُمْ وَأَبْصَارَكُمْ وَخَتَمَ عَلَىٰ قُلُوبِكُمْ مَّنْ إِلَـٰهٌ غَيْرُ ٱللَّهِ يَأْتِيكُمْ بِهِ ٱنْظُرْ كَيْفَ نُصَرِّفُ ٱلآيَاتِ ثُمَّ هُمْ يَصْدِفُونَ,Say to the people of Mecca ‘Have you considered inform me if God were to seize your hearing if He were to make you deaf and your sight if He were to make you blind and set stamp a seal upon your hearts so that you no longer knew anything who is the god other than God to give it back to you?’ that which He took away from you as you are wont to claim? See how We dispense how We make clear the signs the proofs of Our Oneness! Yet thereafter they are turning away they reject them and do not believe.
قُلْ أَرَءَيْتَكُمْ إِنْ أَتَـٰكُمْ عَذَابُ ٱللَّهِ بَغْتَةً أَوْ جَهْرَةً هَلْ يُهْلَكُ إِلاَّ ٱلْقَوْمُ ٱلظَّٰلِمُونَ,Say to them ‘Have you considered for yourselves if God’s chastisement were to come upon you suddenly or openly? at night or during the day; Would any be destroyed except the evildoing the unbelieving folk?’ That is to say none but these will be destroyed.
وَمَا نُرْسِلُ ٱلْمُرْسَلِينَ إِلاَّ مُبَشِّرِينَ وَمُنذِرِينَ فَمَنْ ءَامَنَ وَأَصْلَحَ فَلاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلاَ هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ,We do not send messengers except as bearers of good tidings to those who believe good tidings of Paradise and as warners to those who disbelieve warning of the Fire. Whoever believes in them and makes amends in his deeds no fear shall befall them neither shall they grieve in the Hereafter.
وَٱلَّذِينَ كَذَّبُواْ بِآيَاتِنَا يَمَسُّهُمُ ٱلْعَذَابُ بِمَا كَانُواْ يَفْسُقُونَ,But those who deny Our signs the chastisement shall afflict them because they were wicked rebelling against obedience.
قُل لاَّ أَقُولُ لَكُمْ عِندِي خَزَآئِنُ ٱللَّهِ وَلاۤ أَعْلَمُ ٱلْغَيْبَ وَلاۤ أَقُولُ لَكُمْ إِنِّي مَلَكٌ إِنْ أَتَّبِعُ إِلاَّ مَا يُوحَىٰ إِلَيَّ قُلْ هَلْ يَسْتَوِي ٱلأَعْمَىٰ وَٱلْبَصِيرُ أَفَلاَ تَتَفَكَّرُونَ,Say to them ‘I do not say to you “I possess the treasure houses of God” from which He provides sustenance; and I do not have knowledge of the Unseen that which is hidden from me and has not been revealed to me. And I do not say to you “I am an angel” from among the angels; I only follow what is revealed to me.’ Say ‘Is the blind man the disbeliever equal to the seeing man the believer? No! Will you not then reflect’ upon this and believe?
وَأَنذِرْ بِهِ ٱلَّذِينَ يَخَافُونَ أَن يُحْشَرُوۤاْ إِلَىٰ رَبِّهِمْ لَيْسَ لَهُمْ مِّن دُونِهِ وَلِيٌّ وَلاَ شَفِيعٌ لَّعَلَّهُمْ يَتَّقُونَ,And warn threaten therewith that is with the Qur’ān those who fear they shall be gathered to their Lord apart from Him other than Him they have no protector to help them and no intercessor to intercede for them the negative sentence stands as a circumstantial qualifier referring to the subject of the verb yuhsharū ‘they shall be gathered’ and constitutes the object of what they fear — the sinning believers are meant here; so that they might be wary of God by desisting from what they engage in and performing deeds of obedience.
وَلاَ تَطْرُدِ ٱلَّذِينَ يَدْعُونَ رَبَّهُمْ بِٱلْغَدَاةِ وَٱلْعَشِيِّ يُرِيدُونَ وَجْهَهُ مَا عَلَيْكَ مِنْ حِسَابِهِم مِّن شَيْءٍ وَمَا مِنْ حِسَابِكَ عَلَيْهِمْ مِّن شَيْءٍ فَتَطْرُدَهُمْ فَتَكُونَ مِنَ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ,And do not drive away those who call upon their Lord at morning and evening desiring through their worship His countenance exalted be He and not desiring any of the transient things of this world — and these are the poor. The idolaters had reviled them and demanded that he the Prophet expel them so that they could sit with him. The Prophet s wanted to do this because of his desire that they become Muslims. You are not accountable for them in anything min shay’in min is extra if what they hide in themselves be displeasing; nor are they accountable for you in anything that you should drive them away this is the response to the negative sentence and be of the evildoers if you do this.
وَكَذٰلِكَ فَتَنَّا بَعْضَهُمْ بِبَعْضٍ لِّيَقُولوۤاْ أَهَـٰؤُلاۤءِ مَنَّ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْهِم مِّن بَيْنِنَآ أَلَيْسَ ٱللَّهُ بِأَعْلَمَ بِٱلشَّٰكِرِينَ,And even so We have tried We have tested some of them by others that is the noble one by the commoner the rich man by the poor man preferring the latter one by giving him precedence in attaining faith so that they the noble ones and the rich may say in disavowal ‘Are these the poor the ones whom God has favoured from among us?’ with guidance? In other words so that they may say if what they follow is true guidance they would not have preceded us in attaining it. God exalted be He says Is God not best aware of those who are thankful? to Him to guide them? Indeed He is.
وَإِذَا جَآءَكَ ٱلَّذِينَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِآيَاتِنَا فَقُلْ سَلَٰمٌ عَلَيْكُمْ كَتَبَ رَبُّكُمْ عَلَىٰ نَفْسِهِ ٱلرَّحْمَةَ أَنَّهُ مَن عَمِلَ مِنكُمْ سُوۤءًا بِجَهَٰلَةٍ ثُمَّ تَابَ مِن بَعْدِهِ وَأَصْلَحَ فَأَنَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,And when those who believe in Our signs come to you say to them ‘Peace be upon you. Your Lord has prescribed He has decreed for Himself mercy to the effect that truly innahu ‘truly’ may also be read as annahu ‘that’ as a substitution for al-rahma ‘mercy’ whoever of you does evil in ignorance of it when he did it and repents thereafter after his evil deed repents of it and makes amends in his actions — truly He God is Forgiving Merciful’ towards him a variant reading for innahu ‘truly He’ has annahu ‘then He’ in other words forgiveness shall be for him.
وَكَذَلِكَ نفَصِّلُ ٱلآيَاتِ وَلِتَسْتَبِينَ سَبِيلُ ٱلْمُجْرِمِينَ,And thus in the same way that We have explained what has been mentioned We distinguish We expound the signs the Qur’ān so that truth becomes manifest and is implemented in people’s deeds and that the way the path of the sinners may be become clear evident and hence avoided wa-li-yastabīna may also be read wa-li-tastabīna ‘that you may discern’ with sabīla ‘the way’ read in the accusative as opposed to the nominative sabīlu implying a direct address to the Prophet s.
قُلْ إِنِّي نُهِيتُ أَنْ أَعْبُدَ ٱلَّذِينَ تَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ قُلْ لاَّ أَتَّبِعُ أَهْوَآءَكُمْ قَدْ ضَلَلْتُ إِذاً وَمَآ أَنَاْ مِنَ ٱلْمُهْتَدِينَ,Say ‘Truly I have been forbidden to worship those whom you call upon those whom you worship besides God.’ Say ‘I shall not follow your whims by worshipping them for then if I did follow them verily I would have gone astray and I would not be of the rightly guided’.
قُلْ إِنِّي عَلَىٰ بَيِّنَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّي وَكَذَّبْتُم بِهِ مَا عِندِي مَا تَسْتَعْجِلُونَ بِهِ إِنِ ٱلْحُكْمُ إِلاَّ للَّهِ يَقُصُّ ٱلْحَقَّ وَهُوَ خَيْرُ ٱلْفَٰصِلِينَ,Say ‘I am upon a clear proof a clear statement from my Lord and you have already denied Him my Lord when you associated others with Him. I do not have that which you seek to hasten of the chastisement; the judgement in this matter and in all others is God’s alone. He decrees the judgement of truth and He is the Best of Deciders’ the Best of Judges a variant reading for yaqdī ‘He decrees’ has yaqussu that is ‘He relates the truth’.
قُل لَّوْ أَنَّ عِندِي مَا تَسْتَعْجِلُونَ بِهِ لَقُضِيَ ٱلأَمْرُ بَيْنِي وَبَيْنَكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ أَعْلَمُ بِٱلظَّالِمِينَ,Say to them ‘If I did have what you seek to hasten the matter between you and me would have been decided by my hastening it for you so that I might find rest; but God has it; and God knows best the evildoers’ and when to punish them.
وَعِندَهُ مَفَاتِحُ ٱلْغَيْبِ لاَ يَعْلَمُهَآ إِلاَّ هُوَ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا فِي ٱلْبَرِّ وَٱلْبَحْرِ وَمَا تَسْقُطُ مِن وَرَقَةٍ إِلاَّ يَعْلَمُهَا وَلاَ حَبَّةٍ فِي ظُلُمَٰتِ ٱلأَرْضِ وَلاَ رَطْبٍ وَلاَ يَابِسٍ إِلاَّ فِي كِتَٰبٍ مُّبِينٍ,And with Him exalted be He are the keys of the Unseen its treasure houses or the paths that lead to knowledge of it; none but He knows them and these are the five things mentioned in His saying Surely God He has knowledge of the Hour and He sends down the rain and He knows what is in the wombs. And no soul knows what it has earned for the morrow; nor does any soul know in what land it will die. Truly God is Knowing Aware Q. 3134 as reported by al-Bukhārī. He knows what is happening on land in the deserts and in the waters in the towns along the rivers; and not a leaf min waraqatin min is extra falls but He knows it. Not a grain in the shadows of the earth nothing of wet or dry this entire clause wa-lā habbatin fī zulumāti l-ardi wa-lā ratbin wa-lā yābisin is a supplement to waraqatin ‘a leaf’ but it is in a clear book namely the Preserved Tablet al-lawh al-mahfūz. The exceptive clause illā fī kitābin mubīn ‘but it is in a clear book’ constitutes an inclusive substitution for the previous exceptive clause illā ya‘lamuhā ‘but He knows it’.
وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِي يَتَوَفَّٰكُم بِٱلَّيلِ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا جَرَحْتُم بِٱلنَّهَارِ ثُمَّ يَبْعَثُكُمْ فِيهِ لِيُقْضَىٰ أَجَلٌ مُّسَمًّى ثُمَّ إِلَيْهِ مَرْجِعُكُمْ ثُمَّ يُنَبِّئُكُم بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ,It is He Who takes you at night seizing your spirits during sleep and He knows what you commit what you earn by day. Then He raises you up therein that is in the daytime by restoring your spirits so that an appointed term namely the term of life may be accomplished; and afterward to Him is your return through resurrection. Then He will inform you of what you used to do and so requite you for it.
وَهُوَ ٱلْقَاهِرُ فَوْقَ عِبَادِهِ وَيُرْسِلُ عَلَيْكُم حَفَظَةً حَتَّىٰ إِذَا جَآءَ أَحَدَكُمُ ٱلْمَوْتُ تَوَفَّتْهُ رُسُلُنَا وَهُمْ لاَ يُفَرِّطُونَ,He is the Vanquisher Superior over His servants. And He sends guardians over you angels to record your deeds until when death approaches one of you Our messengers the angels charged with the seizing of the spirits take him tawaffathu; a variant reading has tawaffāhu and they neglect not they do not fall short of what they have been commanded.
ثُمَّ رُدُّوۤاْ إِلَىٰ ٱللَّهِ مَوْلاَهُمُ ٱلْحَقِّ أَلاَ لَهُ ٱلْحُكْمُ وَهُوَ أَسْرَعُ ٱلْحَاسِبِينَ,Then they creatures are restored to God their Protector their Possessor the True the Eternal the Just so that He might requite them. Surely His is the judgement the decree that will be carried out in their case. He is the swiftest of reckoners reckoning with the whole of creation in half a day of the days of this world on the basis of a hadīth to this effect.
قُلْ مَن يُنَجِّيكُمْ مِّن ظُلُمَاتِ ٱلْبَرِّ وَٱلْبَحْرِ تَدْعُونَهُ تَضَرُّعاً وَخُفْيَةً لَّئِنْ أَنجَانَا مِنْ هَـٰذِهِ لَنَكُونَنَّ مِنَ ٱلشَّاكِرِينَ,Say O Muhammad (s) to the people of Mecca ‘Who delivers you from the darkness of the land and the sea from their terrors during your journeys? When you call upon Him openly and secretly saying “Verily if la-in the lām is for oaths You God deliver us anjaytanā is also read anjānā ‘if He delivers us’ from this darkness and hardship we shall truly be among the thankful”’ the believers.
قُلِ ٱللَّهُ يُنَجِّيكُمْ مِّنْهَا وَمِن كُلِّ كَرْبٍ ثُمَّ أَنتُمْ تُشْرِكُونَ,Say to them ‘God delivers you read yunjīkum or yunajjīkum from that and from every distress from every other anxiety. Yet you associate others with Him’.
قُلْ هُوَ ٱلْقَادِرُ عَلَىٰ أَن يَبْعَثَ عَلَيْكُمْ عَذَاباً مِّن فَوْقِكُمْ أَوْ مِن تَحْتِ أَرْجُلِكُمْ أَوْ يَلْبِسَكُمْ شِيَعاً وَيُذِيقَ بَعْضَكُمْ بَأْسَ بَعْضٍ ٱنْظُرْ كَيْفَ نُصَرِّفُ ٱلآيَاتِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَفْقَهُونَ,Say ‘He has the power to send forth upon you a chastisement from above you from the heaven such as stones cf. Q. 832 or a Cry cf. Q. 1167 or from beneath your feet such as the causing of the earth to cave in cf. Q. 2940 or to confound you to confuse you in parties sects with differing whims and to make you taste the violence of one another’ through fighting. When this verse was revealed the Prophet s said ‘This chastisement etc. is easier and lighter’; but when the last statement was revealed he said ‘I seek refuge with Your Countenance!’ as reported by al-Bukhārī. Muslim reports the following hadīth ‘I requested from my Lord not to make my community violent towards each other but He denied me this request’. In another hadīth when it was revealed he is reported to have said ‘As for this it will surely come to pass even though its proper meaning has not yet come’. See how We dispense how We clarify for them the signs the proofs of Our power that perhaps they might understand that they might realise that what they follow is falsehood.
وَكَذَّبَ بِهِ قَوْمُكَ وَهُوَ ٱلْحَقُّ قُل لَّسْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ بِوَكِيلٍ,Your people have denied it the Qur’ān. Yet it is the truth. Say to them ‘I am not a guardian over you to requite you. I am only a warner and your affair is left to God — this was revealed before the command to fight the idolaters.
لِّكُلِّ نَبَإٍ مُّسْتَقَرٌّ وَسَوْفَ تَعْلَمُونَ,Every tiding every announcement has a conclusion a fixed time in which it will take place and be concluded including the tiding concerning your punishment. And you will come to know’ — this is a threat for them.
وَإِذَا رَأَيْتَ ٱلَّذِينَ يَخُوضُونَ فِيۤ ءَايَاتِنَا فَأَعْرِضْ عَنْهُمْ حَتَّىٰ يَخُوضُواْ فِي حَدِيثٍ غَيْرِهِ وَإِمَّا يُنسِيَنَّكَ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنُ فَلاَ تَقْعُدْ بَعْدَ ٱلذِّكْرَىٰ مَعَ ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ,When you see those who engage in discourse about Our signs the Qur’ān in mockery turn away from them and do not sit with them until they discourse on some other topic. And if immā the letter nūn of the conditional particle in has been assimilated with the extra mā Satan should make you forget read yunsiyannaka or yunassiyannaka and you sit with them then do not sit after the reminder that is after you remember with the evildoing folk the overt noun al-qawm al-zālimīn ‘the evildoing folk’ replaces the third person pronominalisation.
وَمَا عَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ يَتَّقُونَ مِنْ حِسَابِهِم مِّن شَيْءٍ وَلَـٰكِن ذِكْرَىٰ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَّقُونَ,The Muslims then said ‘If we get up and leave every time they delve into the matter of the Qur’ān we would never be able to sit in the Mosque or perform circumambulations. Therefore the following was revealed Those who fear God are not accountable for them for those who discourse in mockery in anything min shay’in min is extra if they should sit with them; but it is the reminder that they are accountable for; a reminder given to make them remember and to admonish them so that perhaps they will be wary of discoursing thus.
وَذَرِ الَّذِينَ ٱتَّخَذُواْ دِينَهُمْ لَعِباً وَلَهْواً وَغَرَّتْهُمُ ٱلْحَيَٰوةُ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَذَكِّرْ بِهِ أَن تُبْسَلَ نَفْسٌ بِمَا كَسَبَتْ لَيْسَ لَهَا مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ وَلِيٌّ وَلاَ شَفِيعٌ وَإِن تَعْدِلْ كُلَّ عَدْلٍ لاَّ يُؤْخَذْ مِنْهَآ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ أُبْسِلُواْ بِمَا كَسَبُواْ لَهُمْ شَرَابٌ مِّنْ حَمِيمٍ وَعَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ بِمَا كَانُواْ يَكْفُرُونَ,And forsake leave alone those who take their religion with which they have been charged as a game and a diversion making a mockery of it and whom the life of this world has deluded and so do not interfere with them — this was revealed before the command to fight them. Remind admonish people thereby by the Qur’ān lest a soul perish lest it be given up for destruction for what it has earned what it has done; it has no protector no helper besides God other than Him and no intercessor to ward off the chastisement from it; and though it offer every compensation though it pay every ransom it shall not be accepted from it that which it offers as ransom. Those are the ones who perish by what they have earned; for them shall be a draught of boiling water and a painful chastisement because they disbelieved that is for their unbelief.
قُلْ أَنَدْعُواْ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ مَا لاَ يَنفَعُنَا وَلاَ يَضُرُّنَا وَنُرَدُّ عَلَىٰ أَعْقَابِنَا بَعْدَ إِذْ هَدَانَا ٱللَّهُ كَٱلَّذِي ٱسْتَهْوَتْهُ ٱلشَّيَاطِينُ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ حَيْرَانَ لَهُ أَصْحَابٌ يَدْعُونَهُ إِلَى ٱلْهُدَى ٱئْتِنَا قُلْ إِنَّ هُدَى ٱللَّهِ هُوَ ٱلْهُدَىٰ وَأُمِرْنَا لِنُسْلِمَ لِرَبِّ ٱلْعَالَمِينَ,Say ‘Shall we call upon shall we worship instead of God that which neither profits us if we worship them nor hurts us if we neglect to worship them — these are the idols; and so be turned back and so return to idolatry after God has guided us to Islam? — Like one whom the devils have lured led astray in the earth bewildered confused not knowing where to go hayrān ‘bewildered’ is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the suffixed pronoun hā’ of istahwat-hu ‘whom they have lured’; he has companions a group who call him to guidance that is to say they are there in order to guide him to the right path saying to him “Come to us!”’ but he does not respond to them and he perishes the interrogative statement is meant as a disavowal; the comparative statement beginning with ka’lladhī ‘like one whom’ is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the subject of the verb nuraddu ‘be turned back’. Say ‘Truly God’s guidance which is Islam is the true guidance everything else being error and we have been commanded to submit to the Lord of the Worlds
وَأَنْ أَقِيمُواْ ٱلصَّلاةَ وَٱتَّقُوهُ وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِيۤ إِلَيْهِ تُحْشَرُونَ,and to that is to submit by establishing prayer and fearing Him exalted be He; He it is to Whom you shall be gathered’ you shall be brought together on the Day of Resurrection for reckoning.
وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِي خَلَقَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضَ بِٱلْحَقِّ وَيَوْمَ يَقُولُ كُن فَيَكُونُ قَوْلُهُ ٱلْحَقُّ وَلَهُ ٱلْمُلْكُ يَوْمَ يُنفَخُ فِي ٱلصُّورِ عَٰلِمُ ٱلْغَيْبِ وَٱلشَّهَٰدَةِ وَهُوَ ٱلْحَكِيمُ ٱلْخَبِيرُ,He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in truth that is to say with the purpose of manifesting truth. And mention the day He says to a thing ‘Be’ and it is — this is the Day of Resurrection when He says to creatures ‘Rise up’ and they do. His words are the truth the truth that will doubtless come to pass; and His is the Kingdom the day when the trumpet the horn is blown the second blast by the angel Isrāfīl when there shall be no kingdom for any other than Him ‘Whose is the Kingdom today? God’s’ Q. 4016. He is the Knower of the Unseen and the visible what is hidden and what may be seen. He is the Wise in His creation the Aware of things inwardly hidden and outwardly manifest.
وَإِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ لأَبِيهِ آزَرَ أَتَتَّخِذُ أَصْنَاماً آلِهَةً إِنِّيۤ أَرَاكَ وَقَوْمَكَ فِي ضَلاَلٍ مُّبِينٍ,And mention when Abraham said to his father Āzar which was his cognomen his first name being Terah Tārikh ‘Do you take idols as gods to worship? an interrogative meant as a rebuke. I see you and your people by this act of taking them as gods in manifest error’ far from the truth.
وَكَذَلِكَ نُرِيۤ إِبْرَاهِيمَ مَلَكُوتَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَلِيَكُونَ مِنَ ٱلْمُوقِنِينَ,And so just as We show him the misguidance of his father and his people We show Abraham the kingdom of the heavens and the earth that he might infer thereby the truth of Our Oneness and that he might be of those knowing it with certainty the sentence beginning with wa-kadhālika ‘and so’ and what follows it is a parenthetical statement and a supplement to the one beginning with qāla ‘he said’.
فَلَمَّا جَنَّ عَلَيْهِ ٱلْلَّيْلُ رَأَى كَوْكَباً قَالَ هَـٰذَا رَبِّي فَلَمَّآ أَفَلَ قَالَ لاۤ أُحِبُّ ٱلآفِلِينَ,When night descended when it darkened upon him he saw a star — said to have been Venus — and said to his people who were astrologers ‘This is my Lord’ as you are wont to claim. But when it set when it disappeared he said ‘I love not those that set’ to take them as lords because it is not possible for a true Lord to be transformed or to change place as such attributes pertain to accidents — but this had no effect on them.
فَلَمَّآ رَأَى ٱلْقَمَرَ بَازِغاً قَالَ هَـٰذَا رَبِّي فَلَمَّآ أَفَلَ قَالَ لَئِن لَّمْ يَهْدِنِي رَبِّي لأَكُونَنَّ مِنَ ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلضَّالِّينَ,And when he saw the moon rising appearing he said to them ‘This is my Lord.’ But when it set he said ‘Unless my Lord guides me unless He establishes me within true guidance I shall surely become one of the folk who are astray’ — an intimation to his people that they are astray but still this had no effect on them.
فَلَماَّ رَأَى ٱلشَّمْسَ بَازِغَةً قَالَ هَـٰذَا رَبِّي هَـٰذَآ أَكْبَرُ فَلَمَّآ أَفَلَتْ قَالَ يٰقَوْمِ إِنِّي بَرِيۤءٌ مِّمَّا تُشْرِكُونَ,And when he saw the sun rising he said ‘This is my Lord; this is greater!’ than the star and the moon the masculine demonstrative pronoun hādhā ‘this’ is used for the feminine shams ‘sun’ because the predicate rabbī ‘my Lord’ is masculine. But when it set and the argument against them had become stronger and they still had not repented he said ‘O my people surely I am innocent of what you associate with God in the way of idols and accidental bodies which require an originator. They then asked him ‘What do you worship?’
إِنِّي وَجَّهْتُ وَجْهِيَ لِلَّذِي فَطَرَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضَ حَنِيفاً وَمَآ أَنَاْ مِنَ ٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ,He said Verily I have turned my face to I am seeking in worship Him Who originated created the heavens and the earth namely God; a hanīf inclining towards the upright religion and I am not of those that associate others’ with Him.
وَحَآجَّهُ قَوْمُهُ قَالَ أَتُحَٰجُّوۤنِّي فِي ٱللَّهِ وَقَدْ هَدَانِ وَلاَ أَخَافُ مَا تُشْرِكُونَ بِهِ إِلاَّ أَن يَشَآءَ رَبِّي شَيْئاً وَسِعَ رَبِّي كُلَّ شَيْءٍ عِلْماً أَفَلاَ تَتَذَكَّرُونَ,But his people disputed with him they argued with him about his religion and threatened him that the idols would strike him with evil if he abandoned them. He said ‘Do you dispute with me read a-tuhājjūnnī or a-tuhājūnī where one of the two letters nūn is omitted the nūn which grammarians refer to as nūn al-raf‘ ‘the nūn of modal independence’ and which the Qur’ānic reciters refer to as nūn al-wiqāya ‘the nūn of preservation’; do you argue with me concerning the Oneness of God when He exalted be He has guided me to it? I have no fear of what you associate with Him in the way of idols that they might strike me with some evil since they have no power to do anything unless my Lord wills something harmful to befall me and it does. My Lord encompasses all things through His knowledge; will you not remember this and believe?
وَكَيْفَ أَخَافُ مَآ أَشْرَكْتُمْ وَلاَ تَخَافُونَ أَنَّكُمْ أَشْرَكْتُم بِٱللَّهِ مَا لَمْ يُنَزِّلْ بِهِ عَلَيْكُمْ سُلْطَٰناً فَأَيُّ ٱلْفَرِيقَيْنِ أَحَقُّ بِٱلأَمْنِ إِن كُنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ,How should I fear what you have associated with God when it can neither profit nor harm and you fear not God in that you have associated with God in worship that for which He has not revealed to you any warrant?’ any argument or proof when He has power over all things. Which of the two parties has more right to security is it us or you if you have any knowledge of who has more right? In other words it is us so follow Him. God exalted be He says
ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَلَمْ يَلْبِسُوۤاْ إِيمَانَهُمْ بِظُلْمٍ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ لَهُمُ ٱلأَمْنُ وَهُمْ مُّهْتَدُونَ,Those who believe and have not confounded mixed their belief with evildoing that is idolatry — explained as such by a hadīth in the two Sahīhs of Bukhārī and Muslim — theirs is security from chastisement; and they are rightly guided.
وَتِلْكَ حُجَّتُنَآ ءَاتَيْنَٰهَآ إِبْرَٰهِيمَ عَلَىٰ قَوْمِهِ نَرْفَعُ دَرَجَٰتٍ مَّن نَّشَآءُ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ حَكِيمٌ عَلِيمٌ,That tilka is the subject of the sentence and is substituted by the following hujjatunā argument of Ours with which Abraham inferred God’s Oneness as in the case of the setting stars and what came afterwards; the predicate is what follows We bestowed upon Abraham We guided him to it as an argument against his people. We raise up in degrees whom We will read this as a genitive annexation darajāti man nashā’ or as accusative nunation darajātin man nashā’ degrees in knowledge and wisdom; surely your Lord is Wise in His actions Knowing of His creation.
وَوَهَبْنَا لَهُ إِسْحَاقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ كُلاًّ هَدَيْنَا وَنُوحاً هَدَيْنَا مِن قَبْلُ وَمِن ذُرِّيَّتِهِ دَاوُودَ وَسُلَيْمَانَ وَأَيُّوبَ وَيُوسُفَ وَمُوسَىٰ وَهَارُونَ وَكَذَلِكَ نَجْزِي ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,And We bestowed upon him Isaac and his son Jacob; each one of the two We guided. And Noah We guided before that is before Abraham and of his seed that is Noah’s seed David and his son Solomon and Job and Joseph son of Jacob and Moses and Aaron; and so in the same way that We have requited them We requite the virtuous.
وَزَكَرِيَّا وَيَحْيَىٰ وَعِيسَىٰ وَإِلْيَاسَ كُلٌّ مِّنَ ٱلصَّالِحِينَ,And Zachariah and his son John and Jesus son of Mary — this shows that the term ‘seed’ dhurriyya can include offspring from the female side — and Elias the paternal nephew of Aaron brother of Moses; all of them were of the righteous.
وَإِسْمَاعِيلَ وَٱلْيَسَعَ وَيُونُسَ وَلُوطاً وَكُلاًّ فَضَّلْنَا عَلَى ٱلْعَالَمِينَ,And Ishmael son of Abraham and Elisha Ilyasa‘ the lām is extra and Jonah and Lot son of Hārān brother of Abraham all of them We preferred above all the worlds through prophethood.
وَمِنْ آبَائِهِمْ وَذُرِّيَّاتِهِمْ وَإِخْوَانِهِمْ وَٱجْتَبَيْنَاهُمْ وَهَدَيْنَاهُمْ إِلَىٰ صِرَاطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ,And of their fathers and of their seed and of their brethren this clause is a supplement either to the previous kullan ‘all of them’ or to Nūhan ‘Noah’; min ‘of’ is partitive because some of them did not have offspring while others had disbelievers among their offspring; and We chose them and We guided them to a straight path.
ذٰلِكَ هُدَى ٱللَّهِ يَهْدِي بِهِ مَن يَشَآءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ وَلَوْ أَشْرَكُواْ لَحَبِطَ عَنْهُمْ مَّا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ,That religion to which they were guided is God’s guidance wherewith He guides whom He will of His servants; had they hypothetically speaking been idolaters all that they did would have been in vain.
أُوْلَـٰئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ آتَيْنَاهُمُ ٱلْكِتَابَ وَٱلْحُكْمَ وَٱلنُّبُوَّةَ فَإِن يَكْفُرْ بِهَا هَـٰؤُلاۤءِ فَقَدْ وَكَّلْنَا بِهَا قَوْماً لَّيْسُواْ بِهَا بِكَافِرِينَ,They are the ones to whom We gave the Scripture meaning the Books of God judgement wisdom and prophethood; so if these people of Mecca disbelieve therein that is in these three then indeed We have entrusted it to We have set aside for it a people who do not disbelieve in it namely the Emigrants Muhājirūn and the Helpers Ansār.
أُوْلَـٰئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ هَدَى ٱللَّهُ فَبِهُدَاهُمُ ٱقْتَدِهْ قُل لاَّ أَسْأَلُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ أَجْراً إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ ذِكْرَىٰ لِلْعَالَمِينَ,They are the ones whom God has guided; so follow their guidance their way of affirming God’s Oneness and of exercising patience read iqtadih ‘follow’ with the silent hā’ whether pausing or continuing the recitation; a variant reading omits it in continuous recitation. Say to the people of Mecca ‘I do not ask of you to give me any wage for it the Qur’ān; it the Qur’ān is only a reminder an admonition to all the worlds’ of mankind and jinn.
وَمَا قَدَرُواْ ٱللَّهَ حَقَّ قَدْرِهِ إِذْ قَالُواْ مَآ أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ بَشَرٍ مِّن شَيْءٍ قُلْ مَنْ أَنزَلَ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ ٱلَّذِي جَآءَ بِهِ مُوسَىٰ نُوراً وَهُدًى لِّلنَّاسِ تَجْعَلُونَهُ قَرَاطِيسَ تُبْدُونَهَا وَتُخْفُونَ كَثِيراً وَعُلِّمْتُمْ مَّا لَمْ تَعْلَمُوۤاْ أَنتُمْ وَلاَ ءَابَآؤُكُمْ قُلِ ٱللَّهُ ثُمَّ ذَرْهُمْ فِي خَوْضِهِمْ يَلْعَبُونَ,They that is the Jews measured not God with His true measure that is they have not extended Him the grandeur that truly befits Him or it means they have not attained the true knowledge of Him when they said to the Prophet s disputing with him about the Qur’ān ‘God has not revealed anything to any mortal.’ Say to them ‘Who revealed the Book which Moses brought a light and guidance for mankind? You put it in all three instances the verbs may be read either in the third person plural yaj‘alūnahu ‘they put it’; yubdūnahā ‘they reveal it’; wa-yukhfūna ‘and they hide’ or in the second person plural taj‘alūnahu ‘you put it’; tubdūnahā ‘you reveal it’; wa-tukhfūna ‘and you hide’ on parchments that is you write it down on fragments of notes which you disclose that is what you choose to disclose thereof but you hide much of what is in them as in the case of the descriptions of Muhammad (s); and you have been taught O Jews in the Qur’ān what you did not know neither you nor your fathers’ in the Torah through the elucidation therein of what you were confused about and in disagreement over. Say ‘God’ revealed it — and if they do not say it there is no other response — then leave them to play in their discourse their falsehood.
وَهَـٰذَا كِتَٰبٌ أَنزَلْنَٰهُ مُبَارَكٌ مُّصَدِّقُ ٱلَّذِي بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ وَلِتُنذِرَ أُمَّ ٱلْقُرَىٰ وَمَنْ حَوْلَهَا وَٱلَّذِينَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱلأَخِرَةِ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِهِ وَهُمْ عَلَىٰ صَلاَتِهِمْ يُحَافِظُونَ,And this Qur’ān is a blessed Book We have revealed confirming that which was before it of scriptures and that you may warn li-tundhira or read li-yundhira ‘that it may warn’ as supplement to the import of the preceding statement sc. ‘to confirm that which was before it and to warn’ in other words We have revealed it for the blessings it gives as a vindication of previous scripture and for you to warn therewith the Mother of Towns and those around it that is the inhabitants of Mecca and all other people; and those who believe in the Hereafter believe in it and they observe their prayers fearing the punishment thereof.
وَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّنِ ٱفْتَرَىٰ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ كَذِباً أَوْ قَالَ أُوْحِيَ إِلَيَّ وَلَمْ يُوحَ إِلَيْهِ شَيْءٌ وَمَن قَالَ سَأُنزِلُ مِثْلَ مَآ أَنَزلَ ٱللَّهُ وَلَوْ تَرَىۤ إِذِ ٱلظَّالِمُونَ فِي غَمَرَاتِ ٱلْمَوْتِ وَٱلْمَلاۤئِكَةُ بَاسِطُوۤاْ أَيْدِيهِمْ أَخْرِجُوۤاْ أَنْفُسَكُمُ ٱلْيَوْمَ تُجْزَوْنَ عَذَابَ ٱلْهُونِ بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَقُولُونَ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ غَيْرَ ٱلْحَقِّ وَكُنْتُمْ عَنْ آيَاتِهِ تَسْتَكْبِرُونَ,And who that is none does greater evil than he who invents lies against God by claiming prophethood when he has not been called to it or who says ‘It is revealed to me’ when nothing has been revealed to him — this was revealed regarding the false prophet Musaylama al-Kadhdhāb — or he who says ‘I will reveal the like of what God has revealed’? — these were the mockers who would say If we wish we can speak the like of this Q. 831; If you could only see O Muhammad (s) when the mentioned evildoers are in the agonies the throes of death and the angels extend their hands against them beating and torturing them saying to them in stern censure ‘Give up your souls! to us that we may seize them. Today you shall be requited with the chastisement of humiliation because you used to say about God other than the truth of claiming prophethood and inspiration falsely and that you used to scorn His signs’ disdaining to believe in them. The response to the conditional statement beginning with law ‘if you could only see’ is ‘you would be seeing a terrifying thing’.
وَلَقَدْ جِئْتُمُونَا فُرَٰدَىٰ كَمَا خَلَقْنَٰكُمْ أَوَّلَ مَرَّةٍ وَتَرَكْتُمْ مَّا خَوَّلْنَٰكُمْ وَرَاءَ ظُهُورِكُمْ وَمَا نَرَىٰ مَعَكُمْ شُفَعَآءَكُمُ ٱلَّذِينَ زَعَمْتُمْ أَنَّهُمْ فِيكُمْ شُرَكَآءُ لَقَد تَّقَطَّعَ بَيْنَكُمْ وَضَلَّ عَنكُم مَّا كُنتُمْ تَزْعُمُونَ,And it is said to them upon their resurrection ‘And now you have come to Us singly each alone without family possessions or children as We created you the first time that is barefoot naked and with foreskins and you have left what We conferred on you of wealth behind your backs in the world without you having any choice; and — it is said to them in rebuke — We do not see with you your intercessors the idols whom you claimed to be associates of God amongst you that is in deserving your worship; it has been severed between you that is to say your bond has been dissolved a variant reading for baynukum ‘your union’ has baynakum ‘between you’ making it an adverbial qualifier that is the bond ‘between you’ has been severed’ and that intercession of theirs which you claimed in the world has failed abandoned you’.
إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ فَالِقُ ٱلْحَبِّ وَٱلنَّوَىٰ يُخْرِجُ ٱلْحَيَّ مِنَ ٱلْمَيِّتِ وَمُخْرِجُ ٱلْمَيِّتِ مِنَ ٱلْحَيِّ ذٰلِكُمُ ٱللَّهُ فَأَنَّىٰ تُؤْفَكُونَ,God it is Who splits the grain from the plants and the date-stone from the palm-trees. He brings forth the living from the dead such as the human being from the sperm and the bird from the egg; and is the Bringer-forth of the dead the sperm and the egg from the living. That Splitter and Bringer-forth is God. How then are you deluded? so how then are you turned away from faith despite the proof being established?
فَالِقُ ٱلإِصْبَاحِ وَجَعَلَ ٱلْلَّيْلَ سَكَناً وَٱلشَّمْسَ وَٱلْقَمَرَ حُسْبَاناً ذٰلِكَ تَقْدِيرُ ٱلْعَزِيزِ ٱلْعَلِيمِ,He is the Cleaver of the daybreak al-isbāh is the verbal noun meaning al-subh ‘dawn’ in other words He splits the morning shaft the first light that appears after the darkness of night and He has appointed the night for stillness in which creatures rest from toil and the sun and the moon read both in the accusative wa’l-shamsa wa’l-qamara as a supplement to the syntactical status of al-layla ‘the night’ for reckoning for the calculation of periods of time or if the prefixed preposition bā’ is considered to have been omitted bi-husbān making it husbān a circumstantial qualifier referring to an implied verb such as yajriyān ‘they follow courses’ that is ‘they follow courses precisely calculated bi-husbān’ as is stated in the verse of sūrat al-Rahmān Q. 555.That mentioned is the ordaining of the Mighty in His kingdom the Knowing of His creation.
وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِي جَعَلَ لَكُمُ ٱلنُّجُومَ لِتَهْتَدُواْ بِهَا فِي ظُلُمَٰتِ ٱلْبَرِّ وَٱلْبَحْرِ قَدْ فَصَّلْنَا ٱلآيَٰتِ لِقَوْمٍ يَعْلَمُونَ,And He it is Who appointed for you the stars that you may guide your course by them amid the darkness of land and sea when travelling. Verily We have distinguished We have elucidated the signs the proofs of Our power for a people who have knowledge a people who reflect.
وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِيۤ أَنشَأَكُم مِّن نَّفْسٍ وَٰحِدَةٍ فَمُسْتَقَرٌّ وَمُسْتَوْدَعٌ قَدْ فَصَّلْنَا ٱلآيَٰتِ لِقَوْمٍ يَفْقَهُونَ,And He it is Who produced you created you from a single soul namely Adam such that some of you are established in the womb and some of you are deposited in the loins a variant reading of mustaqirrun ‘established’ has mustaqarrun that is a resting place for you. Verily We have distinguished the signs for a people who understand what is being said to them.
وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِيۤ أَنزَلَ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مَآءً فَأَخْرَجْنَا بِهِ نَبَاتَ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ فَأَخْرَجْنَا مِنْهُ خَضِراً نُّخْرِجُ مِنْهُ حَبّاً مُّتَرَاكِباً وَمِنَ ٱلنَّخْلِ مِن طَلْعِهَا قِنْوَانٌ دَانِيَةٌ وَجَنَّٰتٍ مِّنْ أَعْنَابٍ وَٱلزَّيْتُونَ وَٱلرُّمَّانَ مُشْتَبِهاً وَغَيْرَ مُتَشَٰبِهٍ ٱنْظُرُوۤاْ إِلِىٰ ثَمَرِهِ إِذَآ أَثْمَرَ وَيَنْعِهِ إِنَّ فِي ذٰلِكُمْ لأَيَٰتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يُؤْمِنُونَ,And He it is Who sent down water from the heaven and therewith with the water We bring forth there is a shift away from the third to the second person in this address plants of every kind that produces shoots and therefrom from the shoots We bring forth some verdure meaning ‘the greens’ in other words vegetation bringing forth from it from the verdure thick-clustered grain in dense clusters — such as the spikes of wheat and the like — and from the palm-tree wa-mina’l-nakhli is the predicate and is substituted by the following min tal‘ihā ‘from its pollen’ from its pollen — that which is the first to be produced by it — spring bunches of dates qinwānun is the subject of the sentence stalks with date clusters bunched up one near the other and We bring forth from it gardens orchards of grapes and olives and pomegranates the leaves of both of these being similar mushtabihan is a circumstantial qualifier but the fruits of which are not alike. Look O you addressed in reflection upon their fruits read thamarihi or thumurihi the plural of thamara like shajara ‘tree’ as plural of shajar and khashaba ‘a piece of wood’ for khashab when they have borne fruit when this first begins how it looks and look upon their ripening after they have reached full growth and the state to which they return. Surely in all that are signs proofs of His power exalted be He to resurrect and to do all other things for a people who believe it is these people that are specifically mentioned because they are the ones to profit from those signs by their believing in them in contrast to the disbelievers.
وَجَعَلُواْ للَّهِ شُرَكَآءَ ٱلْجِنَّ وَخَلَقَهُمْ وَخَرَقُواْ لَهُ بَنِينَ وَبَنَٰتٍ بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ سُبْحَٰنَهُ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ عَمَّا يَصِفُونَ,Yet they ascribe to God li’Llāhi the indirect object as associates shurakā’a the direct object which is substituted by the following al-jinn the jinn since they obey them by worshipping graven images even though He created them so how can they be associates? And they falsely impute to Him read kharaqū or kharraqū that is they invent sons and daughters without any knowledge saying Ezra ‘Uzayr is the son of God and the angels are the daughters of God. Glory be to Him — an affirmation of His transcendence — and exalted be He above what they describe! of Him having a child.
بَدِيعُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ أَنَّىٰ يَكُونُ لَهُ وَلَدٌ وَلَمْ تَكُنْ لَّهُ صَٰحِبَةٌ وَخَلَقَ كُلَّ شَيْءٍ وهُوَ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عَلِيمٌ,He is the Originator of the heavens and the earth which He originated uniquely without precedent; how should He have a son when He has no consort spouse and He created everything that was meant to be created and He has knowledge of all things?
ذٰلِكُمُ ٱللَّهُ رَبُّكُمْ لاۤ إِلَـٰهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ خَٰلِقُ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ فَٱعْبُدُوهُ وَهُوَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ وَكِيلٌ,That then is God your Lord. There is no god but Him the Creator of all things. So worship Him affirm His Oneness. And He is Guardian over He is Keeper of all things.
لاَّ تُدْرِكُهُ ٱلأَبْصَٰرُ وَهُوَ يُدْرِكُ ٱلأَبْصَٰرَ وَهُوَ ٱللَّطِيفُ ٱلْخَبِيرُ,Vision cannot attain Him that is they the eyes cannot see Him — this is a denial that applies in particular circumstances since it is accepted that the believer will see Him in the Hereafter as indicated by God’s words On that Day faces shall be radiant gazing upon their Lord Q. 7522f. and by the hadīth of the two Shaykhs Bukhārī and Muslim ‘Verily you shall see your Lord as clearly as you see the full moon at night’ — and it is also said to mean that it vision cannot encompass Him; but He attains all vision that is to say He perceives them whereas they cannot perceive Him; it is not possible in the case of anyone other than Him to attain all vision while it vision cannot attain Him or encompass Him in knowledge. And He is the Subtle in dealing with His friends the Aware of them.
قَدْ جَآءَكُمْ بَصَآئِرُ مِن رَّبِّكُمْ فَمَنْ أَبْصَرَ فَلِنَفْسِهِ وَمَنْ عَمِيَ فَعَلَيْهَا وَمَآ أَنَاْ عَلَيْكُمْ بِحَفِيظٍ,Say O Muhammad (s) to them Clear proofs have come to you from your Lord; whoever perceives them and believes then it is for his own good that he has perceived them since the reward resulting from his perception will be his; and whoever is blind to them and goes astray then it the evil consequence of his being astray will be to his own hurt. And I am not a keeper a watcher over you of your deeds I am but a warner.
وَكَذٰلِكَ نُصَرِّفُ ٱلآيَاتِ وَلِيَقُولُواْ دَرَسْتَ وَلِنُبَيِّنَهُ لِقَوْمٍ يَعْلَمُونَ,And so in the same way that We have explained what has been mentioned We dispense We elucidate the signs that they might take heed and that they the disbelievers may say at the end of this ‘You have studied with someone’ that you have consulted with dārasta the People of the Scripture or that you have studied darasta variant reading the scriptures of past peoples and brought this Qur’ān therefrom; and that We may make it clear for a people who have knowledge.
ٱتَّبِعْ مَآ أُوحِيَ إِلَيْكَ مِن رَّبِّكَ لاۤ إِلَـٰهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ وَأَعْرِضْ عَنِ ٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ,Follow what has been revealed to you from your Lord namely the Qur’ān. There is no god but Him; and turn away from the idolaters.
وَلَوْ شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ مَآ أَشْرَكُواْ وَمَا جَعَلْنَاكَ عَلَيْهِمْ حَفِيظاً وَمَآ أَنتَ عَلَيْهِم بِوَكِيلٍ,Had God willed they would not have been idolaters; and We have not set you as a keeper over them a watcher so that you might then requite them for their deeds; nor are you a guardian over them so that you might be able to coerce them to faith — this was revealed before the command to fight them.
وَلاَ تَسُبُّواْ ٱلَّذِينَ يَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ فَيَسُبُّواْ ٱللَّهَ عَدْواً بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ كَذَلِكَ زَيَّنَّا لِكُلِّ أُمَّةٍ عَمَلَهُمْ ثُمَّ إِلَىٰ رَبِّهِمْ مَّرْجِعُهُمْ فَيُنَبِّئُهُمْ بِمَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ,Do not revile those whom they call upon besides God namely the idols lest they then revile God out of spite out of aggression and wrongfully through ignorance that is through their ignorance of God. So in the same way that We have adorned for these that which they practise We have adorned for every community their good and evil deeds and they commit them; then to their Lord they shall return in the Hereafter and He will tell them what they used to do and requite them for it.
وَأَقْسَمُواْ بِٱللَّهِ جَهْدَ أَيْمَٰنِهِمْ لَئِن جَآءَتْهُمْ آيَةٌ لَّيُؤْمِنُنَّ بِهَا قُلْ إِنَّمَا ٱلآيَٰتُ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ وَمَا يُشْعِرُكُمْ أَنَّهَآ إِذَا جَآءَتْ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ,They that is the disbelievers of Mecca have sworn by God the most earnest oaths that if there came to them a sign of what they requested they will believe in it. Say to them ‘Signs are only with God’ and He sends them down as and when He wills; I am but a warner. But what will make you realise? how would you know if they have believed if these signs did come to them? In other words you would not know this; truly when they come they will not believe because of what I already know a variant reading for lā yu’minūna ‘they will not believe’ has lā tu’minūna ‘you will not believe’ making the address to the disbelievers; another variant reading has annahā instead of innahā ‘that truly’ as meaning la‘alla ‘that perhaps’ or as governed by the preceding clause la’in jā’athum āyatun ‘if there came to them a sign’.
وَنُقَلِّبُ أَفْئِدَتَهُمْ وَأَبْصَٰرَهُمْ كَمَا لَمْ يُؤْمِنُواْ بِهِ أَوَّلَ مَرَّةٍ وَنَذَرُهُمْ فِي طُغْيَانِهِمْ يَعْمَهُونَ,And We shall confound their hearts We shall turn their hearts away from the truth so that they cannot understand it and their eyes away from it so that they do not see it and thus do not believe; just as they did not believe in it that is in the verses that have been revealed the first time; and We shall leave them in their insolence in their misguidance wandering blindly hesitating perplexed.
وَلَوْ أَنَّنَا نَزَّلْنَآ إِلَيْهِمُ ٱلْمَلاۤئِكَةَ وَكَلَّمَهُمُ ٱلْمَوْتَىٰ وَحَشَرْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ كُلَّ شَيْءٍ قُبُلاً مَّا كَانُواْ لِيُؤْمِنُوۤاْ إِلاَّ أَن يَشَآءَ ٱللَّهُ وَلَـٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَهُمْ يَجْهَلُونَ,And if We had sent down the angels to them and the dead had spoken with them as they have requested and We had gathered against them all things in droves read qubulan plural of qabīl meaning ‘throng upon throng’ or read qibalan meaning ‘before their very eyes’ and they were witness to your truthfulness yet they would not have believed as God already knows unless God willed that they believe and they did; but most of them are ignorant of this.
وَكَذَٰلِكَ جَعَلْنَا لِكُلِّ نِبِيٍّ عَدُوّاً شَيَٰطِينَ ٱلإِنْسِ وَٱلْجِنِّ يُوحِي بَعْضُهُمْ إِلَىٰ بَعْضٍ زُخْرُفَ ٱلْقَوْلِ غُرُوراً وَلَوْ شَآءَ رَبُّكَ مَا فَعَلُوهُ فَذَرْهُمْ وَمَا يَفْتَرُونَ,And so We have appointed to every Prophet an enemy just as We have appointed these your enemies and this ‘adūwwan ‘an enemy’ is substituted by the following shayātīn ‘devils’ devils the rebels of mankind and jinn who inspire whisper fine speech to each other the falsehood that is disguised as such fine speech in delusion that is in order to delude them; yet had your Lord willed they would never have done it that mutual inspiration. So leave them let the disbelievers be with what they fabricate of disbelief and otherwise of what has been adorned for them — this was revealed before the command to fight them.
وَلِتَصْغَىۤ إِلَيْهِ أَفْئِدَةُ ٱلَّذِينَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱلآخِرَةِ وَلِيَرْضَوْهُ وَلِيَقْتَرِفُواْ مَا هُم مُّقْتَرِفُونَ,And that the hearts of those who do not believe in the Hereafter may incline to it wa-li-tasghā is a supplement to the above ghurūran ‘in delusion’ that is to that fine speech and that they may be pleased with it and that they may acquire earn what they are acquiring of sins and be punished for it.
أَفَغَيْرَ ٱللَّهِ أَبْتَغِي حَكَماً وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِيۤ أَنَزَلَ إِلَيْكُمُ ٱلْكِتَابَ مُفَصَّلاً وَٱلَّذِينَ آتَيْنَاهُمُ ٱلْكِتَابَ يَعْلَمُونَ أَنَّهُ مُنَزَّلٌ مِّن رَّبِّكَ بِٱلْحَقِّ فَلاَ تَكُونَنَّ مِنَ ٱلْمُمْتَرِينَ,The following was revealed when they asked the Prophet s to appoint an arbiter between him and themselves. Say Shall I seek demand other than God as a judge an arbiter between you and me when it is He Who revealed to you the Book the Qur’ān clearly explained? wherein truth is distinguished from falsehood. Those to whom We have given the Scripture the Torah the likes of ‘Abd Allāh b. Salām and his companions know that it is revealed read munzal or munazzal from your Lord in truth; so do not be of the waverers the doubters regarding it this is intended to affirm to the disbelievers that it is the truth.
وَتَمَّتْ كَلِمَتُ رَبِّكَ صِدْقاً وَعَدْلاً لاَّ مُبَدِّلِ لِكَلِمَاتِهِ وَهُوَ ٱلسَّمِيعُ ٱلْعَلِيمُ,Perfected is the word of your Lord in the way of rulings and appointed terms in truthfulness and justice sidqan wa-‘adlan is for specification; none can change His words either by contravening His rulings or evading His appointed terms. He is the Hearing of what is said the Knowing of what is done.
وَإِن تُطِعْ أَكْثَرَ مَن فِي ٱلأَرْضِ يُضِلُّوكَ عَن سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ إِن يَتَّبِعُونَ إِلاَّ ٱلظَّنَّ وَإِنْ هُمْ إِلاَّ يَخْرُصُونَ,If you obey most of those on earth that is the disbelievers they will lead you astray from the way of God from His religion; they follow only supposition when they dispute with you concerning the status of carrion saying ‘What God has killed is more worthy of your consumption than what you kill yourselves!’; they are merely guessing speaking falsehood in this matter.
إِنَّ رَبَّكَ هُوَ أَعْلَمُ مَن يَضِلُّ عَن سَبِيلِهِ وَهُوَ أَعْلَمُ بِٱلْمُهْتَدِينَ,Your Lord knows best those who stray from His way and He knows well the rightly guided and will requite both of them.
فَكُلُواْ مِمَّا ذُكِرَ ٱسْمُ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْهِ إِن كُنتُمْ بِآيَاتِهِ مُؤْمِنِينَ,So eat from that over which God’s Name has been invoked that is that which has been sacrificed to His Name if you believe in His signs.
وَمَا لَكُمْ أَلاَّ تَأْكُلُواْ مِمَّا ذُكِرَ ٱسْمُ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْهِ وَقَدْ فَصَّلَ لَكُمْ مَّا حَرَّمَ عَلَيْكُمْ إِلاَّ مَا ٱضْطُرِرْتُمْ إِلَيْهِ وَإِنَّ كَثِيراً لَّيُضِلُّونَ بِأَهْوَائِهِم بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ هُوَ أَعْلَمُ بِٱلْمُعْتَدِينَ,What is wrong with you that you do not eat from that over which God’s Name has been invoked of sacrifices when He has detailed for both verbs read the passive fussila ‘it has been detailed’ and hurrima ‘that which has been forbidden’ or the active fassala ‘He has detailed’ and harrama ‘what He has forbidden’ for you what He has forbidden in the verse Forbidden to you is carrion … Q. 53 except that to which you are compelled? thereof which is also lawful for you. The meaning is there is nothing to prevent you from eating what has been mentioned for He has explained to you what is forbidden for consumption and that over which God’s Name has been invoked is not among these forbidden things. But truly many are led astray read la-yadillūna ‘many are led astray’ or la-yudillūna ‘many lead others astray’ by their whims by what their own selves fancy in the way of permitting the consumption of carrion and otherwise without any knowledge with which to support their claims. Truly your Lord knows the transgressors those who overstep the bounds of what is lawful into what is unlawful.
وَذَرُواْ ظَٰهِرَ ٱلإِثْمِ وَبَاطِنَهُ إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يَكْسِبُونَ ٱلإِثْمَ سَيُجْزَوْنَ بِمَا كَانُواْ يَقْتَرِفُونَ,And forsake leave outward aspect of sin and its inward aspect that is what is overt of it and what is secret — it is said that ‘sin’ here means fornication or it is said any act of disobedience; surely those who earn sin shall be requited in the Hereafter for what they used to perpetrate what they used to earn.
وَلاَ تَأْكُلُواْ مِمَّا لَمْ يُذْكَرِ ٱسْمُ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْهِ وَإِنَّهُ لَفِسْقٌ وَإِنَّ ٱلشَّيَٰطِينَ لَيُوحُونَ إِلَىۤ أَوْلِيَآئِهِمْ لِيُجَٰدِلُوكُمْ وَإِنْ أَطَعْتُمُوهُمْ إِنَّكُمْ لَمُشْرِكُونَ,And do not eat from that over which God’s Name has not been invoked where it has died or been sacrificed to other than His Name — otherwise what a Muslim sacrifices and does not invoke God’s Name over whether intentionally or forgetfully is lawful as was stated by Ibn ‘Abbās and this is the opinion of al-Shāfi‘ī — verily it the eating thereof is wickedness a contravention of what is lawful. And truly the devils inspire whisper to their friends the disbelievers to dispute with you in deeming carrion lawful; and if you obey them in this matter you are truly idolaters.
أَوَ مَن كَانَ مَيْتاً فَأَحْيَيْنَٰهُ وَجَعَلْنَا لَهُ نُوراً يَمْشِي بِهِ فِي ٱلنَّاسِ كَمَن مَّثَلُهُ فِي ٱلظُّلُمَٰتِ لَيْسَ بِخَارِجٍ مِّنْهَا كَذَلِكَ زُيِّنَ لِلْكَٰفِرِينَ مَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ,The following was revealed regarding Abū Jahl and others Why is he who was dead through unbelief and We gave him life through guidance and appointed for him a light by which to walk among people distinguishing thereby the truth from falsehood — this light being faith — as him whose likeness ka-man mathaluhu mathal ‘likeness’ is extra; in other words read ka-man huwa ‘as him who’ is in darkness whence he cannot emerge? — and this is the disbeliever — No! So in the same way that faith has been adorned for believers what the disbelievers have been doing in the way of disbelief and acts of disobedience has been adorned for them.
وَكَذٰلِكَ جَعَلْنَا فِي كُلِّ قَرْيَةٍ أَكَٰبِرَ مُجْرِمِيهَا لِيَمْكُرُواْ فِيهَا وَمَا يَمْكُرُونَ إِلاَّ بِأَنْفُسِهِمْ وَمَا يَشْعُرُونَ,And thus in the same way that We have made the wicked folk of Mecca its leaders We have made in every city its sinners great ones that they may plot therein to impede the faith; but they plot only against themselves because the evil consequences thereof will befall them though they do not perceive this.
وَإِذَا جَآءَتْهُمْ آيَةٌ قَالُواْ لَن نُّؤْمِنَ حَتَّىٰ نُؤْتَىٰ مِثْلَ مَآ أُوتِيَ رُسُلُ ٱللَّهِ ٱللَّهُ أَعْلَمُ حَيْثُ يَجْعَلُ رِسَالَتَهُ سَيُصِيبُ ٱلَّذِينَ أَجْرَمُواْ صَغَارٌ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ وَعَذَابٌ شَدِيدٌ بِمَا كَانُواْ يَمْكُرُونَ,And when a sign of the truth of the Prophet s comes to them the people of Mecca they say ‘We will not believe in him until we are given the like of what God’s messengers were given’ in the way of a message and inspiration to us because we are wealthier and more senior in years. God exalted be He says God knows best where to place His Message read plural risālātihi ‘His Messages’ or singular risālatahu ‘His Message’; hayth ‘where’ constitutes the direct object because of the verb ya‘lam ‘He knows’ implicit in a‘lam ‘the best knower’ that is to say He knows the right place for it to be placed in and He thus places it there — these people however are not worthy of it. Humiliation from God and a terrible chastisement shall smite those who have sinned by saying this for their plotting.
فَمَن يُرِدِ ٱللَّهُ أَن يَهْدِيَهُ يَشْرَحْ صَدْرَهُ لِلإِسْلَٰمِ وَمَن يُرِدْ أَن يُضِلَّهُ يَجْعَلْ صَدْرَهُ ضَيِّقاً حَرَجاً كَأَنَّمَا يَصَّعَّدُ فِي ٱلسَّمَآءِ كَذٰلِكَ يَجْعَلُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلرِّجْسَ عَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ,Whomever God desires to guide He expands his breast to Islam by casting into his heart a light which it the heart expands for and accepts as reported in a hadīth; and whomever He God desires to send astray He makes his breast narrow read dayqan or dayyiqan unable to accept it and constricted extremely tight read harijan ‘constricted’ as an adjective or harajan as a verbal noun by which it the heart of the misguided one is described hyperbolically as if he were engaged in ascent yassa‘‘ad is also read as yassā‘ad in both forms the original tā’ has been assimilated with the sād; a third variant reading has yas‘ad to the heaven when he is charged with the obligations of the faith because of the hardship for him therein. So like this making of the breast narrow God casts ignominy chastisement or He casts Satan that is He gives him authority over those who do not believe.
وَهَـٰذَا صِرَاطُ رَبِّكَ مُسْتَقِيماً قَدْ فَصَّلْنَا ٱلآيَاتِ لِقَوْمٍ يَذَّكَّرُونَ,And this path that you follow O Muhammad (s) is the path of your Lord a straight one with no crookedness therein mustaqīman ‘straight’ is in the accusative because it is a circumstantial qualifier emphasising the previous statement and it is operated by the import of the demonstrative noun hādhā ‘this’. We have detailed We have elucidated the signs for a people who remember yadhdhakkarūn the original tā’ has been assimilated with the dhāl that is to say a people who heed admonition — such people are singled out for mention because they are the ones to profit from the signs.
لَهُمْ دَارُ ٱلسَّلَٰمِ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ وَهُوَ وَلِيُّهُمْ بِمَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ,Theirs will be the abode of peace namely Paradise with their Lord and He will be their Friend because of what they used to do.
وَيَوْمَ يِحْشُرُهُمْ جَمِيعاً يَٰمَعْشَرَ ٱلْجِنِّ قَدِ ٱسْتَكْثَرْتُمْ مِّنَ ٱلإِنْسِ وَقَالَ أَوْلِيَآؤُهُم مِّنَ ٱلإِنْسِ رَبَّنَا ٱسْتَمْتَعَ بَعْضُنَا بِبَعْضٍ وَبَلَغْنَآ أَجَلَنَا ٱلَّذِيۤ أَجَّلْتَ لَنَا قَالَ ٱلنَّارُ مَثْوَٰكُمْ خَٰلِدِينَ فِيهَآ إِلاَّ مَا شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ حَكِيمٌ عَليمٌ,And mention the day when He God shall gather them yahshuruhum may also read nahshuruhum ‘We shall gather them’ that is creatures all together and it will be said to them ‘O assembly of jinn you have garnered much of mankind’ by your misleading them. Then their friends those who obeyed them from among mankind will say ‘Our Lord we enjoyed one another mankind enjoyed what the jinn adorned for them of passions while the jinn enjoyed mankind’s obedience to them; but now we have arrived at the term which You have appointed for us’ that is the Day of Resurrection — this statement expresses extreme regret on their part. He exalted be He will say to them by the tongues of the angels ‘The Fire is your lodging your abode to abide therein’ — except what God wills of those times when they will exit from it in order to drink boiling water which is located outside it as God exalted be He has said Then they shall return to the Hell-fire Q. 3768; according to Ibn ‘Abbās this proviso pertains to those whom God knows will believe mā ‘what’ thus has the sense of man ‘whom’. Surely your Lord is Wise in His actions Knowing of His creatures.
وَكَذٰلِكَ نُوَلِّي بَعْضَ ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ بَعْضاً بِمَا كَانُواْ يَكْسِبُونَ,So just as We let the rebels from among mankind and jinn enjoy one another We let some of the evildoers have power over others because of what they are wont to earn of acts of disobedience.
يَٰمَعْشَرَ ٱلْجِنِّ وَٱلإِنْسِ أَلَمْ يَأْتِكُمْ رُسُلٌ مِّنْكُمْ يَقُصُّونَ عَلَيْكُمْ آيَاتِي وَيُنذِرُونَكُمْ لِقَآءَ يَوْمِكُمْ هَـٰذَا قَالُواْ شَهِدْنَا عَلَىٰ أَنْفُسِنَا وَغَرَّتْهُمُ ٱلْحَيَاةُ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَشَهِدُواْ عَلَىٰ أَنْفُسِهِمْ أَنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ كَافِرِينَ,‘O assembly of jinn and mankind did not messengers come to you from among you that is from among both of your number — which holds true in the case of mankind since messengers came from among them or by ‘messengers’ if the jinn are meant those messengers among the jinn who are their warners the ones who listen to the speech of the human messengers and convey it to their kind — to recount to you My signs and to warn you of the encounter of this Day of yours?’ They shall say ‘We bear witness against ourselves’ that all this was conveyed to us. God exalted be He says And the life of this world deluded them and so they did not believe. And they bear witness against themselves that they were disbelievers.
ذٰلِكَ أَن لَّمْ يَكُنْ رَّبُّكَ مُهْلِكَ ٱلْقُرَىٰ بِظُلْمٍ وَأَهْلُهَا غَٰفِلُونَ,That sending of the messengers is because an phonetically lightened with the lām of li-annahu implied thus read as li-annahu ‘because’ your Lord would never destroy the towns through injustice on their part while their inhabitants were heedless not having had any Messenger to make things clear to them.
وَلِكُلٍّ دَرَجَٰتٌ مِّمَّا عَمِلُواْ وَمَا رَبُّكَ بِغَٰفِلٍ عَمَّا يَعْمَلُونَ,All of those who perform deeds shall have degrees of requital according to what they have done of good or evil. Your Lord is not heedless of what they do ya‘malūna may also be read ta‘malūna ‘you do’.
وَرَبُّكَ ٱلْغَنِيُّ ذُو ٱلرَّحْمَةِ إِن يَشَأْ يُذْهِبْكُمْ وَيَسْتَخْلِفْ مِن بَعْدِكُمْ مَّا يَشَآءُ كَمَآ أَنشَأَكُمْ مِّن ذُرِّيَّةِ قَوْمٍ آخَرِينَ,Your Lord is Independent of His creatures and their worship the Lord of Mercy. If He will He can remove you O people of Mecca by destroying you and leave whom He will of creatures to succeed after you just as He produced you from the seed of another folk whom He removed; but He has spared you as a mercy to you.
إِنَّ مَا تُوعَدُونَ لآتٍ وَمَآ أَنتُم بِمُعْجِزِينَ,Truly that which you are promised of the Hour and chastisement will surely come to pass inevitably and you cannot escape you cannot elude Our chastisement.
قُلْ يَٰقَوْمِ ٱعْمَلُواْ عَلَىٰ مَكَانَتِكُمْ إِنَّي عَامِلٌ فَسَوْفَ تَعْلَمُونَ مَن تَكُونُ لَهُ عَٰقِبَةُ ٱلدَّارِ إِنَّهُ لاَ يُفْلِحُ ٱلظَّٰلِمُونَ,Say to them ‘O my people act according to your state your circumstances; truly I am acting according to my circumstances. And assuredly you will know whose man the relative particle introducing the object of the verb ‘you will know’ sequel shall be the abode that is who shall have the praiseworthy sequel in the abode of the Hereafter will it be us or yourselves? Surely the evildoers the disbelievers will not prosper’ will not find happiness.
وَجَعَلُواْ للَّهِ مِمَّا ذَرَأَ مِنَ ٱلْحَرْثِ وَٱلأَنْعَٰمِ نَصِيباً فَقَالُواْ هَـٰذَا للَّهِ بِزَعْمِهِمْ وَهَـٰذَا لِشُرَكَآئِنَا فَمَا كَانَ لِشُرَكَآئِهِمْ فَلاَ يَصِلُ إِلَىٰ ٱللَّهِ وَمَا كَانَ للَّهِ فَهُوَ يَصِلُ إِلَىٰ شُرَكَآئِهِمْ سَآءَ مَا يَحْكُمُونَ,They the disbelievers of Mecca assign to God of the tillage the crops and the cattle which He multiplied He created a portion which they dispense to visitors and the needy and to their associates belongs a portion which they dispense to such keepers of the tillage and cattle saying ‘This is for God’ — so they assert read bi-za‘mihim or bi-zu‘mihim — ‘and this is for our associates’ and if any of the portion of these associates fell into God’s portion they used to restore it to that of their associates but when something of His portion fell into theirs they would leave it there saying ‘God is Independent and is not in need of this’ as God exalted be He says So that which is intended for their associates does not reach God and that which is intended for God does reach their associates. Evil is that provision of theirs which they decree!
وَكَذٰلِكَ زَيَّنَ لِكَثِيرٍ مِّنَ ٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ قَتْلَ أَوْلَٰدِهِمْ شُرَكَآؤُهُمْ لِيُرْدُوهُمْ وَلِيَلْبِسُواْ عَلَيْهِمْ دِينَهُمْ وَلَوْ شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ مَا فَعَلُوهُ فَذَرْهُمْ وَمَا يَفْتَرُونَ,And thus in the same way that what is mentioned was adorned for them those associates of theirs from among the jinn have adorned for many of the idolaters the slaying of their children by burying them alive shurakā’uhum ‘those associates of theirs’ is read in the nominative as the subject of the verb zayyana ‘adorned’; an alternative reading has the passive zuyyina ‘it has been adorned’ with qatlu ‘the slaying’ in the nominative as the subject of this passive verb awlādahum ‘their children’ in the accusative on account of it being the direct object of qatlu ‘the slaying’ and shurakā’ihim in the genitive as an annexation to qatlu so that the object in this case intervenes between the two elements of the annexation qatlu awlādahum shurakā’ihim ‘their associates killing the children’ — this is acceptable syntactically — and the annexation of qatlu to shurakā’ihim in this latter reading is on account of them the associates commanding the idolaters to do this that they may destroy them and to confuse to make obscure their religion for them. Had God willed they would not have done so; so leave them and that which they fabricate.
وَقَالُواْ هَـٰذِهِ أَنْعَٰمٌ وَحَرْثٌ حِجْرٌ لاَّ يَطْعَمُهَآ إِلاَّ مَن نَّشَآءُ بِزَعْمِهِمْ وَأَنْعَٰمٌ حُرِّمَتْ ظُهُورُهَا وَأَنْعَٰمٌ لاَّ يَذْكُرُونَ ٱسْمَ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْهَا ٱفْتِرَآءً عَلَيْهِ سَيَجْزِيهِم بِمَا كَانُواْ يَفْتَرُونَ,They say ‘These cattle and tillage are sacrosanct forbidden. No one is to eat of them except whom we will’ from among the retainers of the graven images and others — so they assert in other words they have no convincing argument for it — ‘and cattle whose backs have been forbidden and cannot therefore be ridden such as the camels they call Sā’ibas or Hāmīs and cattle over which they do not invoke the Name of God’ when they slaughter them invoking instead the names of their idols ascribing such rules to God; forging lies against Him. He will assuredly requite them for what they used to fabricate against Him.
وَقَالُواْ مَا فِي بُطُونِ هَـٰذِهِ ٱلأَنْعَٰمِ خَالِصَةٌ لِّذُكُورِنَا وَمُحَرَّمٌ عَلَىٰ أَزْوَٰجِنَا وَإِن يَكُن مَّيْتَةً فَهُمْ فِيهِ شُرَكَآءُ سَيَجْزِيهِمْ وَصْفَهُمْ إِنَّهُ حِكِيمٌ عَلِيمٌ,And they say ‘That which is within the bellies of these forbidden cattle namely the camels they call Sā’ibas or Bahīras is reserved permitted for our males and forbidden to our spouses that is the women; but if it be dead read maytatun or maytatan and the verb as either feminine takun or masculine yakun ‘if it be’ then they all may be partakers thereof’. He God will assuredly requite them for their describing this and that as either permitted or forbidden with the appropriate requital thereof. Surely He is Wise in His actions Knowing of His creatures.
قَدْ خَسِرَ ٱلَّذِينَ قَتَلُوۤاْ أَوْلَٰدَهُمْ سَفَهاً بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ وَحَرَّمُواْ مَا رَزَقَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ ٱفْتِرَآءً عَلَى ٱللَّهِ قَدْ ضَلُّواْ وَمَا كَانُواْ مُهْتَدِينَ,They are losers who slay read qatalū or qattalū their children by burying them alive in folly out of ignorance without knowledge and have forbidden what God has provided them of what has been mentioned in calumny against God. Verily they have gone astray and are not guided.
وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِيۤ أَنشَأَ جَنَّٰتٍ مَّعْرُوشَٰتٍ وَغَيْرَ مَعْرُوشَٰتٍ وَٱلنَّخْلَ وَٱلزَّرْعَ مُخْتَلِفاً أُكُلُهُ وَٱلزَّيْتُونَ وَٱلرُّمَّانَ مُتَشَٰبِهاً وَغَيْرَ مُتَشَٰبِهٍ كُلُواْ مِن ثَمَرِهِ إِذَآ أَثْمَرَ وَآتُواْ حَقَّهُ يَوْمَ حَصَادِهِ وَلاَ تُسْرِفُوۤاْ إِنَّهُ لاَ يُحِبُّ ٱلْمُسْرِفِينَ,And He it is Who produces creates gardens orchards trellised extending along the ground as in the case of watermelons and untrellised rising upwards on a stem such as palm-trees; and He produces palm-trees and crops diverse in flavour diverse in the shape and savour of its fruit and seed and olives and pomegranates alike in terms of their leaf mutashābihan ‘alike’ is a circumstantial qualifier and unlike in terms of their savour. Eat of the fruit thereof when it ripens before its maturity passes and pay the due thereof the alms as appropriate on the day of its harvest read yawma hasādahu or yawma hasādihi that is one tenth or half of it and do not be prodigal by giving it all away so that nothing remains for the consumption of your dependants. Truly God does not love the prodigal who overstep the bounds of that which He has delimited for them.
وَمِنَ ٱلأَنْعَٰمِ حَمُولَةً وَفَرْشاً كُلُواْ مِمَّا رَزَقَكُمُ ٱللَّهُ وَلاَ تَتَّبِعُواْ خُطُوَٰتِ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنِ إِنَّهُ لَكُمْ عَدُوٌّ مُّبِينٌ,And He produces of the cattle some for burden fit to bear loads such as the large mature camels and some for light support not fit for these load-bearing tasks such as young camels or sheep such cattle are called farsh because they are like ‘bedding farsh spread on the ground’ on account of their physical closeness to it; eat of that which God has provided you and do not follow the steps of Satan his methods of forbidding things or deeming them lawful. Surely he is a manifest foe to you one whose enmity is evident.
ثَمَٰنِيَةَ أَزْوَٰجٍ مَّنَ ٱلضَّأْنِ ٱثْنَيْنِ وَمِنَ ٱلْمَعْزِ ٱثْنَيْنِ قُلْ ءَآلذَّكَرَيْنِ حَرَّمَ أَمِ ٱلأُنثَيَيْنِ أَمَّا ٱشْتَمَلَتْ عَلَيْهِ أَرْحَامُ ٱلأُنثَيَيْنِ نَبِّئُونِي بِعِلْمٍ إِن كُنتُمْ صَٰدِقِينَ,Eight pairs types thamāniyata azwājin substitutes for hamūlatan wa-farshan ‘some for burdens and some for light support’ two of sheep a male and a female; and of goats read ma‘az or ma‘z two. Say O Muhammad (s) to those who on one occasion deem male cattle forbidden and on another the females thereof and then ascribe such rules to God ‘Is it the two males of the sheep and goats He has forbidden you or the two females of these two types or that which the wombs of the two females contain be they male or female? Inform Me with knowledge of the details of such prohibitions if you speak truly’ in this matter meaning on what basis has the prohibition been made? If it is on the basis of maleness then all males are forbidden; if on the basis of femaleness then all females are so forbidden; if on what the womb may contain then both genders are prohibited. So on what basis are such specifications made? the interrogative is meant as a repudiation.
وَمِنَ ٱلإِبْلِ ٱثْنَيْنِ وَمِنَ ٱلْبَقَرِ ٱثْنَيْنِ قُلْ ءَآلذَّكَرَيْنِ حَرَّمَ أَمِ ٱلأُنْثَيَيْنِ أَمَّا ٱشْتَمَلَتْ عَلَيْهِ أَرْحَامُ ٱلأُنْثَيَيْنِ أَمْ كُنتُمْ شُهَدَآءَ إِذْ وَصَّٰكُمُ ٱللَّهُ بِهَـٰذَا فَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّنِ ٱفْتَرَىٰ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ كَذِباً لِيُضِلَّ ٱلنَّاسَ بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لاَ يَهْدِي ٱلْقَوْمَ ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ,And of the camels two and of the oxen two. Say ‘Is it the two males He has forbidden or the two females? Or what the wombs of the two females contain? Or were you witnesses present when God charged you with this? prohibition such that you use it to support your claims? Nay! You speak lies in this matter. Then who that is none does greater evil than he who invents a lie against God in this matter that he may lead mankind astray without any knowledge? Truly God does not guide evildoing folk’.
قُل لاَّ أَجِدُ فِي مَآ أُوْحِيَ إِلَيَّ مُحَرَّماً عَلَىٰ طَاعِمٍ يَطْعَمُهُ إِلاَّ أَن يَكُونَ مَيْتَةً أَوْ دَماً مَّسْفُوحاً أَوْ لَحْمَ خِنزِيرٍ فَإِنَّهُ رِجْسٌ أَوْ فِسْقاً أُهِلَّ لِغَيْرِ ٱللَّهِ بِهِ فَمَنِ ٱضْطُرَّ غَيْرَ بَاغٍ وَلاَ عَادٍ فَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,Say ‘I do not find in what is revealed to me anything forbidden to him who eats thereof except it be read yakūn or takūn carrion maytatan; or if read maytatun then with the form yakūn ‘it be’ preceding it or blood poured forth flowing as opposed to the case of a liver or a spleen; or the flesh of swine — that indeed is an abomination forbidden or except it be a wicked thing that has been hallowed to other than God that is to say it has been slaughtered in the name of someone else. But whoever is constrained to do any of what has been mentioned and he consumes it neither coveting nor transgressing then surely your Lord is Forgiving to him for what he has consumed Merciful’ towards him. To these prohibited things the Sunna adds all beasts of prey with canine teeth and birds of prey with talons.
وَعَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ هَادُواْ حَرَّمْنَا كُلَّ ذِي ظُفُرٍ وَمِنَ ٱلْبَقَرِ وَٱلْغَنَمِ حَرَّمْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ شُحُومَهُمَآ إِلاَّ مَا حَمَلَتْ ظُهُورُهُمَا أَوِ ٱلْحَوَايَآ أَوْ مَا ٱخْتَلَطَ بِعَظْمٍ ذٰلِكَ جَزَيْنَٰهُم بِبَغْيِهِمْ وِإِنَّا لَصَٰدِقُونَ,And to those of Jewry that is the Jews We forbade every beast with hoof that is every animal which does not have divided toes such as camels and ostriches; and of oxen and sheep We forbade them the fat of them the thin fat lining the stomach and the fat of the kidneys save what their backs carry that is what fat is attached to it or what is carried by their entrails their intestines hawāyā is the plural of hāwiyā’ or hāwiya or what is mingled with bone thereof which is the fat of the rump these were lawful for them; that prohibition We requited them with for their insolence on account of their wrongdoing as already mentioned in sūrat al-Nisā’ Q. 4160; verily We are truthful in recounting Our tidings and Our appointed times.
فَإِن كَذَّبُوكَ فَقُلْ رَّبُّكُمْ ذُو رَحْمَةٍ وَاسِعَةٍ وَلاَ يُرَدُّ بَأْسُهُ عَنِ ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلْمُجْرِمِينَ,So if they deny you with regard to what you have brought then say to them ‘Your Lord has all-embracing mercy for He does not hasten to bring about your punishment — herein is a gentle summoning of them to the faith; and His might His chastisement when it comes will never be driven back from the sinning folk’.
سَيَقُولُ ٱلَّذِينَ أَشْرَكُواْ لَوْ شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ مَآ أَشْرَكْنَا وَلاَ آبَاؤُنَا وَلاَ حَرَّمْنَا مِن شَيْءٍ كَذٰلِكَ كَذَّبَ ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِم حَتَّىٰ ذَاقُواْ بَأْسَنَا قُلْ هَلْ عِندَكُم مِّنْ عِلْمٍ فَتُخْرِجُوهُ لَنَآ إِن تَتَّبِعُونَ إِلاَّ ٱلظَّنَّ وَإِنْ أَنتُمْ إَلاَّ تَخْرُصُونَ,The idolaters will say ‘Had God willed we would not have been idolaters neither we nor our fathers nor would we have forbidden anything’ in other words our idolatry and our forbidding of things are by His will and so He must be satisfied with it. God exalted be He says So in the same way that these have lied those who were before them gave the lie to their prophets until they tasted Our might Our chastisement. Say ‘Have you any knowledge that God is satisfied with this such that you can adduce for us? that is you have no such knowledge. You follow only supposition in this matter merely guessing’ telling lies therein.
قُلْ فَلِلَّهِ ٱلْحُجَّةُ ٱلْبَالِغَةُ فَلَوْ شَآءَ لَهَدَاكُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ,Say if you have no definitive argument then ‘To God belongs the conclusive argument the perfect one for had He willed to guide you He could have guided all of you’.
قُلْ هَلُمَّ شُهَدَآءَكُمُ ٱلَّذِينَ يَشْهَدُونَ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ حَرَّمَ هَـٰذَا فَإِن شَهِدُواْ فَلاَ تَشْهَدْ مَعَهُمْ وَلاَ تَتَّبِعْ أَهْوَآءَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَذَّبُواْ بِآيَاتِنَا وَٱلَّذِينَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱلآخِرَةِ وَهُم بِرَبِّهِمْ يَعْدِلُونَ,Say ‘Come bring forth your witnesses those who can testify that God has forbidden this’ which you have forbidden. Then if they testify do not bear witness with them; and do not follow the whims of those who deny Our signs those who do not believe in the Hereafter and ascribe equals to their Lord associating others with Him.
قُلْ تَعَالَوْاْ أَتْلُ مَا حَرَّمَ رَبُّكُمْ عَلَيْكُمْ أَلاَّ تُشْرِكُواْ بِهِ شَيْئاً وَبِٱلْوَالِدَيْنِ إِحْسَاناً وَلاَ تَقْتُلُوۤاْ أَوْلاَدَكُمْ مِّنْ إمْلاَقٍ نَّحْنُ نَرْزُقُكُمْ وَإِيَّاهُمْ وَلاَ تَقْرَبُواْ ٱلْفَوَاحِشَ مَا ظَهَرَ مِنْهَا وَمَا بَطَنَ وَلاَ تَقْتُلُواْ ٱلنَّفْسَ ٱلَّتِي حَرَّمَ ٱللَّهُ إِلاَّ بِٱلْحَقِّ ذٰلِكُمْ وَصَّاكُمْ بِهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ,Say ‘Come I will recite that which your Lord has made a sacred duty for you that allā consisting of an-lā an being explicative you associate nothing with Him that you be dutiful to parents and that you do not slay your children by burying them alive because of poverty destitution that you may fear — We will provide for you and them — and that you do not draw near any acts of lewdness grave sins such as fornication whether it be manifest or concealed that is acts committed overtly or in secret and that you do not slay the life which God has made sacred except rightfully as in the case of retaliation or as the prescribed punishment for apostasy and the stoning of an adulterer. This which is mentioned is what He has charged you with that perhaps you will understand reflect.
وَلاَ تَقْرَبُواْ مَالَ ٱلْيَتِيمِ إِلاَّ بِٱلَّتِي هِيَ أَحْسَنُ حَتَّىٰ يَبْلُغَ أَشُدَّهُ وَأَوْفُواْ ٱلْكَيْلَ وَٱلْمِيزَانَ بِٱلْقِسْطِ لاَ نُكَلِّفُ نَفْساً إِلاَّ وُسْعَهَا وَإِذَا قُلْتُمْ فَٱعْدِلُواْ وَلَوْ كَانَ ذَا قُرْبَىٰ وَبِعَهْدِ ٱللَّهِ أَوْفُواْ ذٰلِكُمْ وَصَّـٰكُمْ بِهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَذَكَّرُونَ,And that you do not approach the property of the orphan save with that approach which is fairer namely the one wherein lie his best interests until he is of age when he is sexually mature. And give full measure and full weight in justice fairly desisting from any fraud. We do not charge any soul beyond its capacity what it can bear in such matters so that if one makes a mistake in a measure or weight and God knows that his intention had been well-meaning then he suffers no blame as is stated in one hadīth. And if you speak to pass a judgement or otherwise then be just by being truthful even if he the person receiving the statement or the one being accused in it should be a kinsman. And fulfil God’s covenant. This is what He has charged you with that perhaps you will remember read tadhakkarūn or tadhkurūn you will be admonished.
وَأَنَّ هَـٰذَا صِرَاطِي مُسْتَقِيماً فَٱتَّبِعُوهُ وَلاَ تَتَّبِعُواْ ٱلسُّبُلَ فَتَفَرَّقَ بِكُمْ عَن سَبِيلِهِ ذٰلِكُمْ وَصَّاكُمْ بِهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ,And that read anna with lām of li-anna ‘because’ being implied or inna as beginning a new sentence this that I have charged you with is My straight path mustaqīman ‘straight’ is a circumstantial qualifier so follow it; and do not follow other ways paths opposed to it lest it separate you tafarraqa one of the two letters tā’ of the original tatafarraqa has been omitted make you incline away from His way His religion. This is what He has ordained for you that perhaps you will be God-fearing’.
ثُمَّ آتَيْنَا مُوسَى ٱلْكِتَابَ تَمَاماً عَلَى ٱلَّذِيۤ أَحْسَنَ وَتَفْصِيلاً لِّكُلِّ شَيْءٍ وَهُدًى وَرَحْمَةً لَّعَلَّهُمْ بِلِقَآءِ رَبِّهِمْ يُؤْمِنُونَ,Then thumma is for describing events in a sequence We gave Moses the Scripture the Torah complete in grace for him who does good by observing it and a detailing an explanation of all things needed for religion and as a guidance and a mercy that perhaps they that is the Children of Israel might believe in the encounter with their Lord through the Resurrection.
وَهَـٰذَا كِتَٰبٌ أَنزَلْنَـٰهُ مُبَارَكٌ فَٱتَّبِعُوهُ وَٱتَّقُواْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُرْحَمُونَ,And this Qur’ān is a blessed Book which We have revealed; so follow it O people of Mecca by implementing what is in it and be wary of disbelief that perhaps you might find mercy.
أَن تَقُولُوۤاْ إِنَّمَآ أُنزِلَ ٱلْكِتَابُ عَلَىٰ طَآئِفَتَيْنِ مِن قَبْلِنَا وَإِن كُنَّا عَن دِرَاسَتِهِمْ لَغَافِلِينَ,We have revealed it lest you should say ‘The Scripture was revealed only upon two parties — the Jews and the Christians — before us and we in has been softened its noun omitted in other words read as innā indeed have been unacquainted with their study’ their reading of the scripture not knowing any of it since it is not in our own language.
أَوْ تَقُولُواْ لَوْ أَنَّآ أُنزِلَ عَلَيْنَا ٱلْكِتَابُ لَكُنَّآ أَهْدَىٰ مِنْهُمْ فَقَدْ جَآءَكُمْ بَيِّنَةٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَهُدًى وَرَحْمَةٌ فَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّن كَذَّبَ بِآيَاتِ ٱللَّهِ وَصَدَفَ عَنْهَا سَنَجْزِي ٱلَّذِينَ يَصْدِفُونَ عَنْ آيَاتِنَا سُوۤءَ ٱلْعَذَابِ بِمَا كَانُواْ يَصْدِفُونَ,Or lest you should say ‘If the Scripture had been revealed to us we would have surely been more rightly guided than they are’ because of the excellence of our minds. Now indeed a clear proof a clear statement has come to you from your Lord and a guidance and a mercy for him who follows it; and who that is none does greater evil than he who denies God’s signs and turns away from them? We shall surely requite those who turn away from Our signs with dreadful the most severe chastisement for their aversion.
هَلْ يَنظُرُونَ إِلاَّ أَن تَأْتِيهُمُ ٱلْمَلاۤئِكَةُ أَوْ يَأْتِيَ رَبُّكَ أَوْ يَأْتِيَ بَعْضُ ءَايَاتِ رَبِّكَ يَوْمَ يَأْتِي بَعْضُ ءَايَاتِ رَبِّكَ لاَ يَنفَعُ نَفْساً إِيمَٰنُهَا لَمْ تَكُنْ ءَامَنَتْ مِن قَبْلُ أَوْ كَسَبَتْ فِيۤ إِيمَٰنِهَا خَيْراً قُلِ ٱنتَظِرُوۤاْ إِنَّا مُنتَظِرُونَ,Are they waiting — the deniers are indeed waiting — for nothing less than that the angels should come to them read ta’tīyahum or ya’tīyahum to seize their souls or that your Lord that is His command meaning His chastisement should come or that one of your Lord’s signs should come? that is those portents of His that indicate the arrival of the Hour? On the day that one of your Lord’s signs comes — and this is the rising of the sun from the west as reported in the hadīth of the two Sahīhs of Bukhārī and Muslim — it shall not benefit a soul to believe if it had not believed theretofore lam takun āmanat min qabl is an adjectival qualification of nafs ‘a soul’ or a soul which had not until then earned in its belief some good some act of obedience that is to say its repentance shall be of no benefit to it as stated in the hadīth corpus. Say ‘Wait for one of these things We too are waiting’ for it.
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ فَرَّقُواْ دِينَهُمْ وَكَانُواْ شِيَعاً لَّسْتَ مِنْهُمْ فِي شَيْءٍ إِنَّمَآ أَمْرُهُمْ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ ثُمَّ يُنَبِّئُهُم بِمَا كَانُواْ يَفْعَلُونَ,Those who have sundered their religion by being at variance over it accepting some aspects of it and rejecting others and have become differing parties sects with regard to such matters a variant reading for farraqū ‘they have sundered’ has fāraqū meaning that they have abandoned the religion to which they were enjoined and they are the Jews and the Christians you have no concern with them at all in other words do not be concerned with them. Their case will go to God — He will take charge of it — then He will inform them in the Hereafter of what they used to do and requite them for it this was abrogated by the ‘sword’ verse Q. 95.
مَن جَآءَ بِٱلْحَسَنَةِ فَلَهُ عَشْرُ أَمْثَالِهَا وَمَن جَآءَ بِٱلسَّيِّئَةِ فَلاَ يُجْزَىۤ إِلاَّ مِثْلَهَا وَهُمْ لاَ يُظْلَمُونَ,Whoever brings a good deed that is the affirmation of ‘there is no god but God’ shall receive tenfold the like of it that is the reward for ten good deeds and whoever brings an evil deed shall only be requited the like of it that is its appropriate requital; and they shall not be wronged nothing shall be diminished from their just requital.
قُلْ إِنَّنِي هَدَانِي رَبِّيۤ إِلَىٰ صِرَاطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ دِيناً قِيَماً مِّلَّةَ إِبْرَاهِيمَ حَنِيفاً وَمَا كَانَ مِنَ ٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ,Say ‘As for me my Lord has guided me to a straight path ilā sirātin mustaqīm is substituted by the following dīnan qiyaman a right religion an upright one the creed of Abraham a hanīf; and he was not of the idolaters’.
قُلْ إِنَّ صَلاَتِي وَنُسُكِي وَمَحْيَايَ وَمَمَاتِي لِلَّهِ رَبِّ ٱلْعَالَمِينَ,Say ‘My prayer and my rituals my devotions in the way of pilgrimage and otherwise and my living my life and my dying my death are all for God the Lord of the Worlds.
لاَ شَرِيكَ لَهُ وَبِذٰلِكَ أُمِرْتُ وَأَنَاْ أَوَّلُ ٱلْمُسْلِمِينَ,No associate has He in these things. And to this affirmation of the Oneness of God I have been commanded and I am the first of those who submit’ from among this community.
قُلْ أَغَيْرَ ٱللَّهِ أَبْغِي رَبّاً وَهُوَ رَبُّ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ وَلاَ تَكْسِبُ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ إِلاَّ عَلَيْهَا وَلاَ تَزِرُ وَازِرَةٌ وِزْرَ أُخْرَىٰ ثُمَّ إِلَىٰ رَبِّكُمْ مَّرْجِعُكُمْ فَيُنَبِّئُكُمْ بِمَا كُنْتُمْ فِيهِ تَخْتَلِفُونَ,Say ‘Shall I seek any other than God for a lord for a god in other words I shall not seek any other than Him when He is the Lord the Possessor of all things?’ Every soul earns of sin only against itself; and no burdened no sinful soul shall bear the burden of another soul. Then to your Lord shall you return and He will inform you of that over which you differed.
وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِي جَعَلَكُمْ خَلاَئِفَ ٱلأَرْضِ وَرَفَعَ بَعْضَكُمْ فَوْقَ بَعْضٍ دَرَجَاتٍ لِّيَبْلُوَكُمْ فِي مَآ آتَاكُمْ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ سَرِيعُ ٱلْعِقَابِ وَإِنَّهُ لَغَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,And He it is Who has made you successors khalā’if is the plural of khalīfa in other words He has made you to succeed one another therein in the earth and has raised some of you above others in degrees through wealth and status and otherwise so that He may try you that He may test you in what He has given you in order to manifest the obedient among you and the disobedient. Surely your Lord is swift in punishment of those who disobey Him; and surely He is Forgiving to believers Merciful to them.

كِتَابٌ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ فَلاَ يَكُنْ فِي صَدْرِكَ حَرَجٌ مِّنْهُ لِتُنذِرَ بِهِ وَذِكْرَىٰ لِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,This is a Book that is revealed to you — addressing the Prophet s — so let there be no inhibition no constraint in your breast because of it to convey it — for fear that you might be called a liar — that you may warn thereby li-tundhira ‘that you may warn’ is semantically connected to unzila ‘is revealed’ that is to say ‘it is revealed for the purposes of warning’ and as a reminder for those who believe in it.
ٱتَّبِعُواْ مَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكُمْ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَلاَ تَتَّبِعُواْ مِن دُونِهِ أَوْلِيَآءَ قَلِيلاً مَّا تَذَكَّرُونَ,Say to them Follow what has been revealed to you from your Lord namely the Qur’ān and do not follow do not take beside Him namely God in other words other than Him any patrons obeying them in disobedience of Him exalted be He. Little do you remember read tadhakkarūn or yadhakkarūn ‘little are you or they admonished’; the original tā’ of tatadhakkarūn has been assimilated with the dhāl; a variant reading has tadhkurūn; the mā of qalīlan mā ‘little’ is extra merely emphasising the ‘littleness’.
وَكَم مِّن قَرْيَةٍ أَهْلَكْنَاهَا فَجَآءَهَا بَأْسُنَا بَيَاتاً أَوْ هُمْ قَآئِلُونَ,How many kam is predicative and is the direct object of the main verb ahlaknāhā ‘We have destroyed’ a city meaning its inhabitants have We destroyed have We willed its destruction! So Our might Our chastisement came upon it at night or while they slept at noon qā’ilūn al-qaylūla is a rest taken halfway during the day even if it does not involve sleep in other words sometimes it came upon it at night and sometimes it came during the day.
فَمَا كَانَ دَعْوَاهُمْ إِذْ جَآءَهُمْ بَأْسُنَآ إِلاَّ أَن قَالُوۤاْ إِنَّا كُنَّا ظَالِمِينَ,And their only plea their only words when Our might came upon them was to say ‘We were evildoers indeed’.
فَلَنَسْأَلَنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ أُرْسِلَ إِلَيْهِمْ وَلَنَسْأَلَنَّ ٱلْمُرْسَلِينَ,Then verily We shall question those to whom the Message was sent that is We shall question those communities about their response to the messengers and to what extent they implemented that which was conveyed to them; and We shall question the messengers about the conveying of that Message.
فَلَنَقُصَّنَّ عَلَيْهِم بِعِلْمٍ وَمَا كُنَّا غَآئِبِينَ,And We shall narrate to them with knowledge We shall inform them with previous knowledge of what they did; for verily We were not absent when the messengers were conveying the Message nor were We absent during the time of bygone communities and what they did.
وَٱلْوَزْنُ يَوْمَئِذٍ ٱلْحَقُّ فَمَن ثَقُلَتْ مَوَازِينُهُ فَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْمُفْلِحُونَ,The weighing of deeds or of the scrolls of these deeds shall be — in a balance that has a tongue and two palms as scales as reported in a hadīth — on that day that is on the day of the questioning mentioned namely the Day of Resurrection the true weighing the fair weighing al-haqq ‘the true’ is an adjectival qualification of al-wazn ‘the weighing’. As for those whose scales are heavy with good deeds they are the successful the triumphant.
وَمَنْ خَفَّتْ مَوَازِينُهُ فَأُوْلَـۤئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ خَسِرُوۤاْ أَنْفُسَهُم بِمَا كَانُواْ بِآيَاتِنَا يِظْلِمُونَ,And as for those whose scales are light because of evil deeds those are the ones who have lost their souls by causing them to travel towards the Fire because they mistreated they knowingly denied Our signs.
وَلَقَدْ مَكَّنَّاكُمْ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَجَعَلْنَا لَكُمْ فِيهَا مَعَايِشَ قَلِيلاً مَّا تَشْكُرُونَ,And We have given you power O Children of Adam in the earth and have appointed for you therein livelihoods ma‘āyish is the plural of ma‘īsha that is the means by which you are able to subsist; little qalīlan mā mā is to emphasise the ‘littleness’ thanks you show for this.
وَلَقَدْ خَلَقْنَاكُمْ ثُمَّ صَوَّرْنَاكُمْ ثُمَّ قُلْنَا لِلْمَلاۤئِكَةِ ٱسْجُدُواْ لأَدَمَ فَسَجَدُوۤاْ إِلاَّ إِبْلِيسَ لَمْ يَكُنْ مِّنَ ٱلسَّاجِدِينَ,And We created you that is your father Adam then shaped you that is We shaped him with you deposited in his back then said to the angels ‘Prostrate yourselves before Adam!’ a prostration that is a bow of salutation. So they fell prostrate all save Iblīs the father of the jinn who was among the angels — he was not of those who make prostration.
قَالَ مَا مَنَعَكَ أَلاَّ تَسْجُدَ إِذْ أَمَرْتُكَ قَالَ أَنَاْ خَيْرٌ مِّنْهُ خَلَقْتَنِي مِن نَّارٍ وَخَلَقْتَهُ مِن طِينٍ,He exalted be He said ‘What prevented you from falling prostrate allā is made up of an-lā the lā being extra when I commanded you?’ He Iblīs said ‘I am better than him. You created me from fire while him You created from clay’.
قَالَ فَٱهْبِطْ مِنْهَا فَمَا يَكُونُ لَكَ أَن تَتَكَبَّرَ فِيهَا فَٱخْرُجْ إِنَّكَ مِنَ ٱلصَّاغِرِينَ,Said He ‘Then go down from it that is from the Garden — it is also said go down from the heavens — it is not right for you to show pride here so go forth out of it! Surely you are among the abased!’ the contemptible!
قَالَ أَنظِرْنِي إِلَى يَوْمِ يُبْعَثُونَ,Said he ‘Reprieve me postpone my affair until the day when they people are resurrected’.
قَالَ إِنَّكَ مِنَ المُنظَرِينَ,Said He ‘Lo! You are of those reprieved’ — in another verse it is said until the day of an appointed time Q. 3881 that is until the time of the first blast of the Trumpet.
قَالَ فَبِمَآ أَغْوَيْتَنِي لأَقْعُدَنَّ لَهُمْ صِرَاطَكَ ٱلْمُسْتَقِيمَ,Said he ‘Now because You have sent me astray fa-bi-mā aghwaytanī means bi-ighwā’ik ‘for Your sending me astray’ the bā’ is for oaths and the response of the oath is the following verily I shall sit in ambush for them that is for the Children of Adam on Your straight path that is on the path that leads to You.
ثُمَّ لآتِيَنَّهُمْ مِّن بَيْنِ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمِنْ خَلْفِهِمْ وَعَنْ أَيْمَانِهِمْ وَعَن شَمَآئِلِهِمْ وَلاَ تَجِدُ أَكْثَرَهُمْ شَاكِرِينَ,Then I shall come upon them from before them and from behind them and from their right and from their left that is to say from every side and prevent them from following it that path. Ibn ‘Abbās said ‘However he cannot come upon them from above lest he come between the servant and the mercy of God exalted be He’. And You will not find most of them thankful’ believing.
قَالَ ٱخْرُجْ مِنْهَا مَذْءُوماً مَّدْحُوراً لَّمَن تَبِعَكَ مِنْهُمْ لأَمْلأَنَّ جَهَنَّمَ مِنكُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ,Said He ‘Go forth from it degraded read madh’ūman disgraced or despised and banished removed from mercy. As for those of them of people who follow you la-man ‘as for those who’ the lām is for inceptiveness; or it is for introducing the oath which is the following I shall assuredly fill Hell with all of you’ that is with you through your seed and with people — herein in this address those present have predominance over those absent this last sentence of the verse expresses the sense of ‘the requital’ suggested in the conditional man ‘who’ in other words ‘whoever follows you then I shall punish him’.
ويَآءَادَمُ ٱسْكُنْ أَنتَ وَزَوْجُكَ ٱلْجَنَّةَ فَكُلاَ مِنْ حَيْثُ شِئْتُمَا وَلاَ تَقْرَبَا هَـٰذِهِ ٱلشَّجَرَةَ فَتَكُونَا مِنَ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ,And He said ‘O Adam dwell you anta this is reiterated in order to emphasise the subject of the verb uskun ‘dwell’ and to supplement to it what follows and your wife Eve read Hawwā’ in the Garden and eat from whence you will but do not come near this tree to eat of it — and this was wheat — lest you become evildoers’.
فَوَسْوَسَ لَهُمَا ٱلشَّيْطَانُ لِيُبْدِيَ لَهُمَا مَا وُورِيَ عَنْهُمَا مِن سَوْءَاتِهِمَا وَقَالَ مَا نَهَاكُمَا رَبُّكُمَا عَنْ هَـٰذِهِ ٱلشَّجَرَةِ إِلاَّ أَن تَكُونَا مَلَكَيْنِ أَوْ تَكُونَا مِنَ ٱلْخَالِدِينَ,Then Satan Iblīs whispered to them that he might manifest reveal to them that which was hidden wūriya based on the verbal form fū‘ila and derives from the infinitive al-muwārā to them of their shameful parts. And he said ‘Your Lord prohibited you from this tree only in aversion lest you become angels malakayn may also be read malikayn or become immortals’ in other words that is the necessary consequence of eating from it as is stated in another verse Shall I guide you to the Tree of Immortality and a kingdom that does not waste away? Q. 20120.
وَقَاسَمَهُمَآ إِنِّي لَكُمَا لَمِنَ ٱلنَّاصِحِينَ,And he swore to both of them that is he swore to both of them by God ‘Truly I am a sincere adviser to you’ in this matter.
فَدَلاَّهُمَا بِغُرُورٍ فَلَمَّا ذَاقَا ٱلشَّجَرَةَ بَدَتْ لَهُمَا سَوْءَاتُهُمَا وَطَفِقَا يَخْصِفَانِ عَلَيْهِمَا مِن وَرَقِ ٱلْجَنَّةِ وَنَادَاهُمَا رَبُّهُمَآ أَلَمْ أَنْهَكُمَا عَن تِلْكُمَا ٱلشَّجَرَةِ وَأَقُل لَّكُمَآ إِنَّ ٱلشَّيْطَآنَ لَكُمَا عَدُوٌ مُّبِينٌ,Thus did he lead them on thus did he debase them in their status by delusion on his part; and when they tasted of the tree that is when they ate of it their shameful parts were manifested to them that is the front private part of each was revealed to the other as well as their behinds — each of these parts is called saw’a ‘shameful’ because its exposure ‘shames’ yasū’u that person — and they began to piece together they began to stick onto themselves some of the leaves of the Garden to cover themselves up therewith. And their Lord called them ‘Did I not prohibit you from this tree and say to you “Verily Satan is a manifest enemy to you”?’ one whose enmity is evident? the interrogative is meant as an affirmative.
قَالاَ رَبَّنَا ظَلَمْنَآ أَنفُسَنَا وَإِن لَّمْ تَغْفِرْ لَنَا وَتَرْحَمْنَا لَنَكُونَنَّ مِنَ ٱلْخَاسِرِينَ,They said ‘Our Lord we have wronged ourselves by our act of disobedience and if You do not forgive us and have mercy on us we shall surely be among the lost’.
قَالَ ٱهْبِطُواْ بَعْضُكُمْ لِبَعْضٍ عَدُوٌّ وَلَكُمْ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ مُسْتَقَرٌّ وَمَتَاعٌ إِلَىٰ حِينٍ,Said He ‘Go down that is Adam and Eve with all those you comprise of your seed each of you each seed an enemy to the other on account of the wrong each does to the another. There will be for you on earth an abode a place of settlement and enjoyment for a while’ until your terms of life are fulfilled.
قَالَ فِيهَا تَحْيَوْنَ وَفِيهَا تَمُوتُونَ وَمِنْهَا تُخْرَجُونَ,Said He ‘There that is on earth you shall live and there you shall die and from there you shall be brought forth’ through the Resurrection read active takhrujūn ‘you shall come forth’ or passive tukhrajūn ‘you shall be brought forth’.
يَٰبَنِيۤ ءَادَمَ قَدْ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْكُمْ لِبَاساً يُوَارِي سَوْءَاتِكُمْ وَرِيشاً وَلِبَاسُ ٱلتَّقْوَىٰ ذٰلِكَ خَيْرٌ ذٰلِكَ مِنْ آيَاتِ ٱللَّهِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَذَّكَّرُونَ,O Children of Adam! We have sent down on you a garment that is We have created it for you to conceal to cover up your shameful parts and feathers meaning all that one adorns oneself with of garments and the garment of God-fearing righteous deeds and virtuous traits read as libāsa’l-taqwā ‘the garment of God-fearing’ as a supplement to the preceding libāsan ‘a garment’; or read as libāsu’l-tawqā as the subject the predicate of which is the following sentence that is best; that is one of God’s signs the proofs of His power; perhaps they will remember and believe the address shifts from the second to the third person.
يَابَنِيۤ ءَادَمَ لاَ يَفْتِنَنَّكُمُ ٱلشَّيْطَانُ كَمَآ أَخْرَجَ أَبَوَيْكُمْ مِّنَ ٱلْجَنَّةِ يَنزِعُ عَنْهُمَا لِبَاسَهُمَا لِيُرِيَهُمَا سَوْءَاتِهِمَآ إِنَّهُ يَرَاكُمْ هُوَ وَقَبِيلُهُ مِنْ حَيْثُ لاَ تَرَوْنَهُمْ إِنَّا جَعَلْنَا ٱلشَّيَاطِينَ أَوْلِيَآءَ لِلَّذِينَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ,O Children of Adam! Let not Satan tempt you lead you astray that is do not follow him lest you fall into temptation as he caused your parents to go forth from the Garden by tempting them stripping yanzi‘u is a circumstantial qualifier them of their garments to manifest to them their shameful parts. Surely he Satan sees you he and his tribe his army from where you do not see them — because of their ethereal bodies or their being colourless. We have made the devils friends helpers and companions of those who do not believe.
وَإِذَا فَعَلُواْ فَاحِشَةً قَالُواْ وَجَدْنَا عَلَيْهَآ آبَاءَنَا وَٱللَّهُ أَمَرَنَا بِهَا قُلْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لاَ يَأْمُرُ بِٱلْفَحْشَآءِ أَتَقُولُونَ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ مَا لاَ تَعْلَمُونَ,And when they commit any indecency such as idolatry or circumambulating the Sacred House naked saying ‘We cannot perform the circumambulations wearing clothes in which we were disobedient to God’ — and so they forbade this wearing of clothes — they say ‘We found our fathers practising it and so we followed their example and God has also enjoined it on us’. Say to them ‘God does not enjoin indecency. Do you say concerning God that which you do not know?’ that He has said? the interrogative is meant as a repudiation.
قُلْ أَمَرَ رَبِّي بِٱلْقِسْطِ وَأَقِيمُواْ وُجُوهَكُمْ عِندَ كُلِّ مَسْجِدٍ وَٱدْعُوهُ مُخْلِصِينَ لَهُ ٱلدِّينَ كَمَا بَدَأَكُمْ تَعُودُونَ,Say ‘My Lord enjoins justice fairness. And set wa-aqīmū is a supplement to the syntactical significance of bi’l-qist ‘justice’ that is to say it is as if He said ‘Be just and set your faces’ or read wa-aqīmū with an implied fa-aqbilū ‘so turn’ towards it your faces towards God in every place of worship performing your prostrations purely for Him and call upon Him worship Him devoting your religion to Him free of any idolatry. As He brought you into being as He created you when you were nothing so you will return that is so He will bring you back to life on the Day of Resurrection.
فَرِيقاً هَدَىٰ وَفَرِيقاً حَقَّ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلضَّلاَلَةُ إِنَّهُمُ ٱتَّخَذُوا ٱلشَّيَاطِينَ أَوْلِيَآءَ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ وَيَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّهُم مُّهْتَدُونَ,A party of you He has guided while another party has deserved to go astray — they have taken devils as patrons instead of God that is other than Him and think that they are guided’.
يَابَنِيۤ ءَادَمَ خُذُواْ زِينَتَكُمْ عِندَ كُلِّ مَسْجِدٍ وكُلُواْ وَٱشْرَبُواْ وَلاَ تُسْرِفُوۤاْ إِنَّهُ لاَ يُحِبُّ ٱلْمُسْرِفِينَ,O Children of Adam! Don your adornment that which covers your nakedness at every place of worship at prayer and at the circumambulation and eat and drink what you want but do not be excessive; He truly does not love those who are excessive.
قُلْ مَنْ حَرَّمَ زِينَةَ ٱللَّهِ ٱلَّتِيۤ أَخْرَجَ لِعِبَادِهِ وَالْطَّيِّبَاتِ مِنَ ٱلرِّزْقِ قُلْ هِي لِلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ فِي ٱلْحَيَاةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا خَالِصَةً يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ كَذَلِكَ نُفَصِّلُ ٱلآيَاتِ لِقَوْمٍ يَعْلَمُونَ,Say in disavowal of them ‘Who has forbidden the adornment of God which He has brought forth for His servants in the way of garments and the good things the delicious foods of God’s sustenance?’ Say ‘These on the Day of Resurrection shall be exclusively read khālisatun meaning ‘exclusively theirs’ or khālisatan as a circumstantial qualifier for those who believed during the life of this world deservedly even if others should share it with them. Thus We detail the signs We explain them in such detail for a people who know’ who reflect for they are the ones to profit from these signs.
قُلْ إِنَّمَا حَرَّمَ رَبِّيَ ٱلْفَوَاحِشَ مَا ظَهَرَ مِنْهَا وَمَا بَطَنَ وَٱلإِثْمَ وَٱلْبَغْيَ بِغَيْرِ ٱلْحَقِّ وَأَن تُشْرِكُواْ بِٱللَّهِ مَا لَمْ يُنَزِّلْ بِهِ سُلْطَاناً وَأَن تَقُولُواْ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ مَا لاَ تَعْلَمُونَ,Say ‘My Lord forbids only indecencies grave sins such as fornication such of them as are apparent and such as are hidden that is the overt ones and the secret ones and sin the act of disobedience and wrongful insolence against people namely oppression and that you associate with God that for which He never revealed any warrant any definitive proof for such association and that you say concerning God that which you do not know’ in the way of forbidding what He has not forbidden and other things.
وَلِكُلِّ أُمَّةٍ أَجَلٌ فَإِذَا جَآءَ أَجَلُهُمْ لاَ يَسْتَأْخِرُونَ سَاعَةً وَلاَ يَسْتَقْدِمُونَ,Every community has a term a finite period of time. When their term comes they shall not delay it a single hour nor bring it forward.
يَابَنِيۤ ءَادَمَ إِمَّا يَأْتِيَنَّكُمْ رُسُلٌ مِّنكُمْ يَقُصُّونَ عَلَيْكُمْ آيَاتِي فَمَنِ ٱتَّقَىٰ وَأَصْلَحَ فَلاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلاَ هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ,O Children of Adam! If immā the nūn of the conditional particle in has been assimilated with the extra mā there should come to you messengers from among you narrating to you My signs then whoever fears associating others with God and makes amends in his actions — no fear shall befall them neither shall they grieve in the Hereafter.
وَٱلَّذِينَ كَذَّبُواْ بِآيَٰتِنَا وَٱسْتَكْبَرُواْ عَنْهَآ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ أَصْحَٰبُ ٱلنَّارِ هُمْ فِيهَا خَٰلِدُونَ,And those who deny Our signs and scorn them not believing in them — those shall be the inhabitants of the Fire abiding therein.
فَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّنِ ٱفْتَرَىٰ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ كَذِباً أَوْ كَذَّبَ بِآيَاتِهِ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ يَنَالُهُمْ نَصِيبُهُم مِّنَ ٱلْكِتَابِ حَتَّىٰ إِذَا جَآءَتْهُمْ رُسُلُنَا يَتَوَفَّوْنَهُمْ قَالُوۤاْ أَيْنَ مَا كُنتُمْ تَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ قَالُواْ ضَلُّواْ عَنَّا وَشَهِدُواْ عَلَىٰ أَنْفُسِهِمْ أَنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ كَافِرِينَ,And who — that is none — does greater evil than he who invents a lie against God by ascribing to Him a partner or a child or denies His signs? the Qur’ān. Those — their portion their lot of the Scripture of what has been inscribed as theirs in the Preserved Tablet al-lawh al-mahfūz in the way of provision term of life and other matters shall reach them until when Our messengers the angels come to them to take their souls they say to them in reprimand ‘Where is that which you were calling upon worshipping beside God?’ They will say ‘They have gone astray from us’ they are not present before us and so we cannot see them; and they will bear witness against themselves upon death that they were disbelievers.
قَالَ ٱدْخُلُواْ فِيۤ أُمَمٍ قَدْ خَلَتْ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ مِّن ٱلْجِنِّ وَٱلإِنْسِ فِي ٱلنَّارِ كُلَّمَا دَخَلَتْ أُمَّةٌ لَّعَنَتْ أُخْتَهَا حَتَّىٰ إِذَا ٱدَّارَكُواْ فِيهَا جَمِيعاً قَالَتْ أُخْرَاهُمْ لأُولاَهُمْ رَبَّنَا هَـٰؤُلاۤءِ أَضَلُّونَا فَآتِهِمْ عَذَاباً ضِعْفاً مِّنَ ٱلنَّارِ قَالَ لِكُلٍّ ضِعْفٌ وَلَـٰكِن لاَّ تَعْلَمُونَ,He exalted be He will say to them on the Day of Resurrection ‘Enter into the Fire among the number of communities of jinn and mankind who passed away before you’ fī’l-nār ‘into the Fire’ is semantically connected to udkhulū ‘enter’. Every time a community enters the Fire it curses its sister-community the one that came before it because of its having gone astray on account of it until when they have all followed caught up with one another there the last of them those who were the followers shall say to the first of them those whom they revered and followed ‘Our Lord these led us astray; so give them a double chastisement of the Fire.’ He exalted be He will say ‘For each of you and them will be a double chastisement but you do not know’ read ta‘lamūn or ya‘lamūn ‘they do not know’ what will be for each party.
وَقَالَتْ أُولاَهُمْ لأُخْرَاهُمْ فَمَا كَانَ لَكُمْ عَلَيْنَا مِن فَضْلٍ فَذُوقُواْ ٱلْعَذَابَ بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَكْسِبُونَ,And the first of them shall say to the last of them ‘You have no advantage over us since you did not disbelieve because of us you and we are equal in this predicament. God exalted be He says to them So taste the chastisement for what you used to earn’.
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَذَّبُواْ بِآيَٰتِنَا وَٱسْتَكْبَرُواْ عَنْهَا لاَ تُفَتَّحُ لَهُمْ أَبْوَابُ ٱلسَّمَآءِ وَلاَ يَدْخُلُونَ ٱلْجَنَّةَ حَتَّىٰ يَلِجَ ٱلْجَمَلُ فِي سَمِّ ٱلْخِيَاطِ وَكَذٰلِكَ نَجْزِي ٱلْمُجْرِمِينَ,Those who deny Our signs and scorn them not believing in them indeed the gates of heaven shall not be opened for them when their spirits are carried up to it after death for instead they are taken down into Sijjīn cf. Q. 837f. — in contrast to the believer for whom the gates are opened and his spirit is carried up into the seventh heaven as is stated in one hadīth — nor shall they enter Paradise until the camel passes through the eye of the needle which is impossible and so is their entry into Paradise. So with this requital We requite those who are sinful through disbelief.
لَهُمْ مِّن جَهَنَّمَ مِهَادٌ وَمِن فَوْقِهِمْ غَوَاشٍ وَكَذٰلِكَ نَجْزِي ٱلظَّالِمِينَ,Hell shall be their bed and over them coverings of fire ghawāshin is the plural of ghāshiya and its nunation compensates for the omitted yā’. Thus do We requite the evildoers.
وَٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ لاَ نُكَلِّفُ نَفْساً إِلاَّ وُسْعَهَا أُوْلَـٰئِكَ أَصْحَابُ ٱلْجَنَّةِ هُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ,And those who believe and perform righteous deeds wa’lladhīna āmanū wa-‘amilū’l-sālihāti is the subject We do not charge any soul beyond its scope its capacity for action lā nukallifu nafsan illā wus‘ahā ‘We do not charge any soul beyond its scope’ constitutes a parenthetical statement intervening between it the above subject and its predicate which is the following those are the inhabitants of Paradise abiding therein.
وَنَزَعْنَا مَا فِي صُدُورِهِم مِّنْ غِلٍّ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهِمُ ٱلأَنْهَٰرُ وَقَالُواْ ٱلْحَمْدُ للَّهِ ٱلَّذِي هَدَانَا لِهَـٰذَا وَمَا كُنَّا لِنَهْتَدِيَ لَوْلاۤ أَنْ هَدَانَا ٱللَّهُ لَقَدْ جَآءَتْ رُسُلُ رَبِّنَا بِٱلْحَقِّ وَنُودُوۤاْ أَن تِلْكُمُ ٱلْجَنَّةُ أُورِثْتُمُوهَا بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ,We shall strip away all rancour all spite that existed between them in the world that is in their breasts; and beneath them beneath their palaces flow rivers; and they will say once they have settled in their dwellings ‘Praise be to God Who guided us to this action the reward of which is this Paradise; for we would surely never have been guided if God had not guided us the response to the conditional law lā ‘if … not’ is omitted because it is indicated by the preceding clause. Verily the messengers of our Lord did bring the truth.’ And it is cried to them an is read softened that is understand it as annahu; alternatively it is an explicative particle in all five places here and the four to follow ‘This is your Paradise; you have inherited it for what you used to do’.
وَنَادَىۤ أَصْحَابُ ٱلْجَنَّةِ أَصْحَابَ ٱلنَّارِ أَن قَدْ وَجَدْنَا مَا وَعَدَنَا رَبُّنَا حَقّاً فَهَلْ وَجَدتُّم مَّا وَعَدَ رَبُّكُمْ حَقّاً قَالُواْ نَعَمْ فَأَذَّنَ مُؤَذِّنٌ بَيْنَهُمْ أَن لَّعْنَةُ ٱللَّهِ عَلَى ٱلظَّالِمِينَ,And the inhabitants of Paradise will call to the inhabitants of the Fire either in affirmation or in reprimand ‘We have found that which our Lord promised us in the way of reward to be true; have you found that chastisement which your Lord promised you to be true?’ They will say ‘Yes!’ And then a crier a caller shall proclaim between them between both parties making them hear that ‘God’s curse is on the evildoers
ٱلَّذِينَ يَصُدُّونَ عَن سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ وَيَبْغُونَهَا عِوَجاً وَهُمْ بِٱلآخِرَةِ كَافِرُونَ,who bar people from God’s way from His religion desiring it that is they seek the way that is crooked disbelieving in the Hereafter’.
وَبَيْنَهُمَا حِجَابٌ وَعَلَى ٱلأَعْرَافِ رِجَالٌ يَعْرِفُونَ كُلاًّ بِسِيمَاهُمْ وَنَادَوْاْ أَصْحَابَ ٱلْجَنَّةِ أَن سَلاَمٌ عَلَيْكُمْ لَمْ يَدْخُلُوهَا وَهُمْ يَطْمَعُونَ,And between them that is between the inhabitants of Paradise and those of the Fire is a veil a barrier said to be the wall of the Heights and on the Heights which is the wall of Paradise are men whose good deeds and evil deeds are equal as is stated in the hadīth who know each of the inhabitants of Paradise and those of the Fire by their mark — glowing faces in the case of the believers and blackened ones in the case of the disbelievers for they are able to see them their position being high — and they call to the inhabitants of Paradise ‘Peace be upon you!’ God exalted be He says They that is those men of the Heights have not entered it Paradise although they aspire to enter it. Al-Hasan al-Basrī said ‘God causes them to have this aspiration only because He desires to be generous to them’. Al-Hākim reported that Hudhayfa b. al-Yamān said ‘While they are in this situation God appears to them and says “Get up and enter Paradise for I have forgiven you”.’
وَإِذَا صُرِفَتْ أَبْصَارُهُمْ تِلْقَآءَ أَصْحَابِ ٱلنَّارِ قَالُواْ رَبَّنَا لاَ تَجْعَلْنَا مَعَ ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ,And when their eyes those of the men of the Heights are turned towards in the direction of the inhabitants of the Fire they shall say ‘Our Lord do not assign us to the Fire with the evildoing folk’.
وَنَادَىٰ أَصْحَابُ ٱلأَعْرَافِ رِجَالاً يَعْرِفُونَهُمْ بِسِيمَاهُمْ قَالُواْ مَآ أَغْنَىٰ عَنكُمْ جَمْعُكُمْ وَمَا كُنْتُمْ تَسْتَكْبِرُونَ,And those of the Heights call to men from among the inhabitants of the Fire whom they know by their mark saying ‘Your masses of property or your multitude and your haughtiness that is your disdaining of belief have not availed you as protection against the Fire. And they also say to them pointing to those formerly oppressed Muslims
أَهَـۤؤُلاۤءِ ٱلَّذِينَ أَقْسَمْتُمْ لاَ يَنَالُهُمُ ٱللَّهُ بِرَحْمَةٍ ٱدْخُلُواْ ٱلْجَنَّةَ لاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْكُمْ وَلاَ أَنتُمْ تَحْزَنُونَ,Are these the ones of whom you swore that God would never grant them mercy?’ it has already been said to them ‘Enter Paradise; no fear shall come upon you nor shall you grieve’ a variant reading for udkhulū ‘enter’ imperative second person plural has the passive udkhilū ‘they have been admitted’ or dakhalū ‘they entered’; the negation clause ‘no fear shall come upon you nor shall you grieve’ is a circumstantial qualifier in other words they enter Paradise while this is being said to them.
وَنَادَىٰ أَصْحَابُ ٱلنَّارِ أَصْحَابَ ٱلْجَنَّةِ أَنْ أَفِيضُواْ عَلَيْنَا مِنَ ٱلْمَآءِ أَوْ مِمَّا رَزَقَكُمُ ٱللَّهُ قَالُوۤاْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ حَرَّمَهُمَا عَلَى ٱلْكَافِرِينَ,And the inhabitants of the Fire call out to the inhabitants of Paradise saying ‘Pour on us some water or some of that food which God has provided you!’ They say ‘God has forbidden He has prohibited both to the disbelievers
ٱلَّذِينَ ٱتَّخَذُواْ دِينَهُمْ لَهْواً وَلَعِباً وَغَرَّتْهُمُ ٱلْحَيَٰوةُ ٱلدُّنْيَا فَٱلْيَوْمَ نَنسَـٰهُمْ كَمَا نَسُواْ لِقَآءَ يَوْمِهِمْ هَـٰذَا وَمَا كَانُواْ بِآيَٰتِنَا يَجْحَدُونَ,those who took their religion for a diversion and a game and whom the life of this world has deluded.’ Therefore today We have forgotten them We have left them in the Fire just as they forgot the encounter of this day of theirs when they neglected to perform good deeds for it and because they used to deny Our signs.
وَلَقَدْ جِئْنَاهُمْ بِكِتَابٍ فَصَّلْنَاهُ عَلَىٰ عِلْمٍ هُدًى وَرَحْمَةً لِّقَوْمٍ يُؤْمِنُونَ,And indeed We have brought them that is the people of Mecca a Book the Qur’ān which We have detailed which We have made clear through tidings and the Promise of reward and the Threat of punishment with knowledge ‘alā ‘ilmin is a circumstantial qualifier in other words ‘knowing what has been detailed in it’ a guidance hudan is also a circumstantial qualifier referring to the hā’ the suffixed pronoun of fassālnā-hu ‘which We have detailed’ and a mercy for a people who believe in it.
هَلْ يَنظُرُونَ إِلاَّ تَأْوِيلَهُ يَوْمَ يَأْتِي تَأْوِيلُهُ يَقُولُ ٱلَّذِينَ نَسُوهُ مِن قَبْلُ قَدْ جَآءَتْ رُسُلُ رَبِّنَا بِٱلْحَقِّ فَهَل لَّنَا مِن شُفَعَآءَ فَيَشْفَعُواْ لَنَآ أَوْ نُرَدُّ فَنَعْمَلَ غَيْرَ ٱلَّذِي كُنَّا نَعْمَلُ قَدْ خَسِرُوۤاْ أَنْفُسَهُمْ وَضَلَّ عَنْهُمْ مَّا كَانُواْ يَفْتَرُونَ,Are they waiting — they are not waiting — for anything but its fulfilment the consequences of what is in it? On the day when its fulfilment comes which will be on the Day of Resurrection those who were forgetful of it before those who neglected to believe in it shall say ‘Indeed our Lord’s messengers came with the truth. Have we then any intercessors that they may intercede for us or shall we be returned to the world that we may act otherwise than we used to act?’ and instead affirm God’s Oneness and refrain from associating others with Him. It will then be said to them ‘No!’ God exalted be He says Verily they have lost their souls for they have ended up in perdition and that which they used to invent in alleging that God has a partner has failed has abandoned them.
إِنَّ رَبَّكُمُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِي خَلَقَ ٱلسَمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضَ فِي سِتَّةِ أَيَّامٍ ثُمَّ ٱسْتَوَىٰ عَلَى ٱلْعَرْشِ يُغْشِي ٱلَّيلَ ٱلنَّهَارَ يَطْلُبُهُ حَثِيثاً وَٱلشَّمْسَ وَٱلْقَمَرَ وَٱلنُّجُومَ مُسَخَّرَاتٍ بِأَمْرِهِ أَلاَ لَهُ ٱلْخَلْقُ وَٱلأَمْرُ تَبَارَكَ ٱللَّهُ رَبُّ ٱلْعَالَمِينَ,Surely your Lord is God Who created the heavens and the earth in six days of the days of this world that is to say in the equivalent thereof since there was no sun then. Had He willed He could have created them in an instant; but the reason for His not having done so is that He wanted to teach His creatures to be circumspect; then presided upon the Throne a presiding befitting of Him al-‘arsh ‘throne’ in the classical language is the elevated seat on which a king sits. He cloaks read yughshī or yughashshī the night with the day that is He covers each one with the other each following the other in swift pursuit — and the sun and the moon and the stars if all of these are read in the accusative then they constitute a supplement to al-samāwāt ‘the heavens’ and if in the nominative then they constitute the subject of the sentence the predicate of which follows have been made subservient have been subdued by His command by His power. Verily His is all creation and the command in its entirety. Blessed Magnified be God the Lord the Master of the Worlds!
ٱدْعُواْ رَبَّكُمْ تَضَرُّعاً وَخُفْيَةً إِنَّهُ لاَ يُحِبُّ ٱلْمُعْتَدِينَ,Call upon your Lord humbly tadarru‘an is a circumstantial qualifier in subservience and quietly in secret. Truly He loves not the aggressors who are braggarts and loud-mouthed in their supplications.
وَلاَ تُفْسِدُواْ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ بَعْدَ إِصْلاَحِهَا وَٱدْعُوهُ خَوْفاً وَطَمَعاً إِنَّ رَحْمَتَ ٱللَّهِ قَرِيبٌ مِّنَ ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,And work not corruption in the land through idolatry and acts of disobedience after it has been set right as a result of the sending forth of messengers to it and call upon Him in fear of His punishment and in hope of His mercy — surely the mercy of God is near to the virtuous the obedient qarīb ‘near’ as the predicate of the feminine noun rahma ‘mercy’ is in the masculine because it rahma is annexed to Allāh ‘God’.
وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِي يُرْسِلُ ٱلرِّيَاحَ بُشْراً بَيْنَ يَدَيْ رَحْمَتِهِ حَتَّىٰ إِذَآ أَقَلَّتْ سَحَاباً ثِقَالاً سُقْنَاهُ لِبَلَدٍ مَّيِّتٍ فَأَنْزَلْنَا بِهِ ٱلْمَآءَ فَأَخْرَجْنَا بِهِ مِن كُلِّ ٱلثَّمَرَاتِ كَذٰلِكَ نُخْرِجُ ٱلْموْتَىٰ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَذَكَّرُونَ,He it is Who sends the winds unfolding with His mercy that is dispersing before the rains a variant reading for nushuran ‘unfolding’ has nushran; another reading has nashran as the verbal noun; and a third variant has bushran meaning mubashshiran ‘with which He is bearing good tidings of His mercy’; the singular of the first reading is nashūr similar in pattern to rasūl ‘messenger’; the singular of the last is bashīr until when they the winds bear heavy clouds clouds heavy with rain We lead it that is We lead the clouds herein is a shift from the third to the first person to a dead land one devoid of any vegetation in other words We lead it there in order to revive it and then We send down thereon on that land and bring forth thereby by this water fruits of every kind. Like that bringing forth We shall bring forth the dead from their graves through revivification so that you might remember and believe.
وَٱلْبَلَدُ ٱلطَّيِّبُ يَخْرُجُ نَبَاتُهُ بِإِذْنِ رَبِّهِ وَٱلَّذِي خَبُثَ لاَ يَخْرُجُ إِلاَّ نَكِداً كَذٰلِكَ نُصَرِّفُ ٱلآيَاتِ لِقَوْمٍ يَشْكُرُونَ,As for the good land the one of rich soil its vegetation comes forth wholesomely by permission of its Lord — this is a similitude of the believer who when he hears an admonition he heeds it and benefits from it. While as for the one whose soil is bad — the vegetation in it comes forth only miserably laboriously and with difficulty — this is the similitude of the disbeliever. Even as We have made clear what has been mentioned so We dispense We make clear the signs for a people who are thankful to God and so believe.
لَقَدْ أَرْسَلْنَا نُوحاً إِلَىٰ قَوْمِهِ فَقَالَ يَاقَوْمِ ٱعْبُدُواْ ٱللَّهَ مَا لَكُمْ مِّنْ إِلَـٰهٍ غَيْرُهُ إِنِّيۤ أَخَافُ عَلَيْكُمْ عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ,Verily laqad is the response to an oath that has been omitted We sent Noah to his people and he said ‘O my people worship God! You have no god other than Him read ghayrihi as an adjective of ilāh ‘god’ or ghayruhu as a substitution in its place sc. instead of min ilāhin ‘any god’. Truly I fear for you if you worship other than Him the chastisement of an Awful Day’ that is the Day of Resurrection.
قَالَ ٱلْمَلأُ مِن قَوْمِهِ إِنَّا لَنَرَاكَ فِي ضَلاَلٍ مُّبِينٍ,The council of the respected elders of his people said ‘Truly We see you in manifest error’.
قَالَ يَٰقَوْمِ لَيْسَ بِي ضَلَـٰلَةٌ وَلَٰكِنِّي رَسُولٌ مِّن رَّبِّ ٱلْعَـٰلَمِينَ,He said ‘My people there is no error in me dalāla is more general than al-dalāl ‘misguidance’ and so to deny it is more effective than to deny the latter but I am a messenger from the Lord of the Worlds.
أُبَلِّغُكُمْ رِسَالاَتِ رَبِّي وَأَنصَحُ لَكُمْ وَأَعْلَمُ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ مَا لاَ تَعْلَمُونَ,I convey to you read ublighkum or uballighukum the Messages of my Lord and I am advising you I desire good for you for I know from God what you know not.
أَوَ عَجِبْتُمْ أَن جَآءَكُمْ ذِكْرٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ عَلَىٰ رَجُلٍ مِّنْكُمْ لِيُنذِرَكُمْ وَلِتَتَّقُواْ وَلَعَلَّكُمْ تُرْحَمُونَ,Do you then deny marvel that a reminder an admonition from your Lord should come to you through the tongue of a man from among you that he may warn you of chastisement if you do not believe and that you may fear God and that you might be shown mercy’ by it?
فَكَذَّبُوهُ فَأَنجَيْنَاهُ وَٱلَّذِينَ مَعَهُ فِي ٱلْفُلْكِ وَأَغْرَقْنَا ٱلَّذِينَ كَذَّبُواْ بِآيَاتِنَآ إِنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ قَوْماً عَمِينَ,But they denied him and so We delivered him and those with him from drowning in the Ark in the ship and We drowned those who denied Our signs by means of the Flood. Truly they were a people blind to the truth.
وَإِلَىٰ عَادٍ أَخَاهُمْ هُوداً قَالَ يَاقَوْمِ ٱعْبُدُواْ ٱللَّهَ مَا لَكُمْ مِّنْ إِلَـٰهٍ غَيْرُهُ أَفَلاَ تَتَّقُونَ,And We sent to the earlier ‘Ād their brother Hūd. He said ‘O my people worship God affirm His Oneness! You have no god other than Him. Will you not fear?’ will you not fear Him and so believe?
قَالَ ٱلْمَلأُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِن قَوْمِهِ إِنَّا لَنَرَاكَ فِي سَفَاهَةٍ وِإِنَّا لَنَظُنُّكَ مِنَ ٱلْكَاذِبِينَ,The council those of his people who disbelieved said ‘We truly see you in folly ignorance and we truly deem you of the liars’ in your Message.
قَالَ يَٰقَوْمِ لَيْسَ بِي سَفَاهَةٌ وَلَٰكِنِّي رَسُولٌ مِّن رَّبِّ ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ,He said ‘O my people there is no folly in me but I am a messenger from the Lord of the Worlds.
أُبَلِّغُكُمْ رِسَٰلٰتِ رَبِّي وَأَنَاْ لَكُمْ نَاصِحٌ أَمِينٌ,I convey to you the Messages of my Lord and I am your truthful adviser trustworthy in the Message I convey.
أَوَ عَجِبْتُمْ أَن جَآءَكُمْ ذِكْرٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ عَلَىٰ رَجُلٍ مِّنكُمْ لِيُنذِرَكُمْ وَٱذكُرُوۤاْ إِذْ جَعَلَكُمْ خُلَفَآءَ مِن بَعْدِ قَوْمِ نُوحٍ وَزَادَكُمْ فِي ٱلْخَلْقِ بَصْطَةً فَٱذْكُرُوۤاْ ءَالآءَ ٱللَّهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ,Or do you marvel that a reminder from your Lord should come to you through the tongue of a man from among you that he may warn you? And remember when He made you vicegerents on earth after the people of Noah and increased your stature in extension in strength and in height — the tallest of them measured 100 feet the shortest 60. Remember then God’s bounties His graces so that you might prosper’ triumph.
قَالُوۤاْ أَجِئْتَنَا لِنَعْبُدَ ٱللَّهَ وَحْدَهُ وَنَذَرَ مَا كَانَ يَعْبُدُ آبَاؤُنَا فَأْتِنَا بِمَا تَعِدُنَآ إِن كُنتَ مِنَ ٱلصَّادِقِينَ,They said ‘Have you come to us that we should worship God alone and forsake abandon what our fathers worshipped? Then bring upon us what you promised us of chastisement if you are of the truthful’ in what you say.
قَالَ قَدْ وَقَعَ عَلَيْكُمْ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ رِجْسٌ وَغَضَبٌ أَتُجَٰدِلُونَنِي فِيۤ أَسْمَآءٍ سَمَّيْتُمُوهَآ أَنْتُمْ وَآبَآؤكُمُ مَّا نَزَّلَ ٱللَّهُ بِهَا مِن سُلْطَانٍ فَٱنْتَظِرُوۤاْ إِنِّي مَعَكُمْ مِّنَ ٱلْمُنْتَظِرِينَ,He said ‘Already terror chastisement and wrath from your Lord have fallen they must be sent down on you. Do you dispute with me concerning names which you have named that is with which you you and your fathers have named idols that you worship for which that is for the worship of which God has not revealed any warrant? any definitive argument or proof? Then await the chastisement. Truly I shall be with you waiting’ for that on account of your denial of me thus a blighting wind was unleashed against them cf. Q. 514.
فَأَنجَيْنَاهُ وَٱلَّذِينَ مَعَهُ بِرَحْمَةٍ مِّنَّا وَقَطَعْنَا دَابِرَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَذَّبُواْ بِآيَاتِنَا وَمَا كَانُواْ مُؤْمِنِينَ,So We delivered him namely Hūd and those with him from among the believers by a mercy from Us and We cut the root of those people who denied Our signs that is We extirpated them and were not believers wa-mā kānū mu’minīna is a supplement to kadhdhabū ‘those who denied’.
وَإِلَىٰ ثَمُودَ أَخَاهُمْ صَالِحاً قَالَ يَاقَوْمِ ٱعْبُدُواْ ٱللَّهَ مَا لَكُمْ مِّنْ إِلَـٰهٍ غَيْرُهُ قَدْ جَآءَتْكُمْ بَيِّنَةٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ هَـٰذِهِ نَاقَةُ ٱللَّهِ لَكُمْ آيَةً فَذَرُوهَا تَأْكُلْ فِيۤ أَرْضِ ٱللَّهِ وَلاَ تَمَسُّوهَا بِسُوۤءٍ فَيَأْخُذَكُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,And We sent to Thamūd Thamūda read without declining the noun as denoting the tribe of Thamūd itself their brother Sālih. He said ‘O my people worship God! You have no god other than Him. Truly there has come to you a clear proof an illustration from your Lord of my truthfulness this is the she-camel of God a sign for you lakum āyatan is a circumstantial qualifier operated by the import of the demonstrative noun hādhihi ‘this’ they had asked him to make it come out of a specific rock which they had designated. So leave her to feed throughout God’s earth and do not touch her with harm either by hamstringing or beating her lest you be seized by a painful chastisement.
وَٱذْكُرُوۤاْ إِذْ جَعَلَكُمْ خُلَفَآءَ مِن بَعْدِ عَادٍ وَبَوَّأَكُمْ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ تَتَّخِذُونَ مِن سُهُولِهَا قُصُوراً وَتَنْحِتُونَ ٱلْجِبَالَ بُيُوتاً فَٱذْكُرُوۤاْ آلآءَ ٱللَّهِ وَلاَ تَعْثَوْا فِي ٱلأَرْضِ مُفْسِدِينَ,And remember how He made you vicegerents on earth after ‘Ād and gave you habitations in the land making castles in its plains in which you lodge during summer and hewing its mountains into houses in which you lodge during winter buyūtan ‘houses’ is in the accusative because of the implied circumstantial qualifier. So remember God’s bounties and do not be degenerate in the earth seeking corruption’.
قَالَ ٱلْمَلأُ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱسْتَكْبَرُواْ مِن قَوْمِهِ لِلَّذِينَ ٱسْتُضْعِفُواْ لِمَنْ آمَنَ مِنْهُمْ أَتَعْلَمُونَ أَنَّ صَالِحاً مُّرْسَلٌ مِّن رَّبِّهِ قَالُوۤاْ إِنَّا بِمَآ أُرْسِلَ بِهِ مُؤْمِنُونَ,Said the council of those of his people who waxed proud who disdained belief in him to those who were oppressed to such of them as believed that is from among his people li-man āmana minhum ‘to such of them as believed’ is a substitution for the preceding clause li’lladhīna istud‘ifū ‘to those who were oppressed’ repeating the preposition li- ‘to’ ‘Are you aware that Sālih has been sent to you from his Lord?’ They said ‘Yes! Truly we believe in the Message with which he has been sent.’
قَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱسْتَكْبَرُوۤاْ إِنَّا بِٱلَّذِيۤ آمَنتُمْ بِهِ كَافِرُونَ,Said the ones who were proud ‘Truly we are disbelievers of that which you believe!’
فَعَقَرُواْ ٱلنَّاقَةَ وَعَتَوْاْ عَنْ أَمْرِ رَبِّهِمْ وَقَالُواْ يَاصَالِحُ ٱئْتِنَا بِمَا تَعِدُنَآ إِن كُنتَ مِنَ ٱلْمُرْسَلِينَ,The she-camel was given the water one day and then another; but they soon tired of this So they hamstrung the she-camel — Qudār hamstrung her by their command killing her with a sword — and flouted the commandment of their Lord and said ‘O Sālih bring upon us that which you promised us in the way of chastisement for our killing it if you are indeed a messenger’.
فَأَخَذَتْهُمُ ٱلرَّجْفَةُ فَأَصْبَحُواْ فِي دَارِهِمْ جَاثِمِينَ,So the Trembling a violent earthquake and a cry from the heaven seized them and they lay lifeless prostrate in their habitations keeled over their knees dead.
فَتَوَلَّىٰ عَنْهُمْ وَقَالَ يَٰقَوْمِ لَقَدْ أَبْلَغْتُكُمْ رِسَالَةَ رَبِّي وَنَصَحْتُ لَكُمْ وَلَكِن لاَّ تُحِبُّونَ ٱلنَّٰصِحِينَ,So he turned his back on them Sālih left them and said ‘O my people I have conveyed to you the Message of my Lord and gave you sincere advice but you do not love sincere advisers’.
وَلُوطاً إِذْ قَالَ لِقَوْمِهِ أَتَأْتُونَ ٱلْفَاحِشَةَ مَا سَبَقَكُمْ بِهَا مِنْ أَحَدٍ مِّن ٱلْعَالَمِينَ,And mention Lot Lūtan is substituted by the following idh qāla when he said to his people ‘Do you commit abomination that is penetrating the rears of men such as no one in all the worlds ever committed before you humans or jinn?
إِنَّكُمْ لَتَأْتُونَ ٱلرِّجَالَ شَهْوَةً مِّن دُونِ ٱلنِّسَآءِ بَلْ أَنْتُمْ قَوْمٌ مُّسْرِفُونَ,Do you read a-innakum pronouncing both hamzas or by not pronouncing the second one but in both cases inserting an alif between the two; a variant reading has innakum ‘indeed you … ’ come lustfully to men instead of women? Nay you are a wanton folk’ transgressing the bounds going from what is lawful to what is unlawful.
وَمَا كَانَ جَوَابَ قَوْمِهِ إِلاَّ أَن قَالُوۤاْ أَخْرِجُوهُمْ مِّن قَرْيَتِكُمْ إِنَّهُمْ أُنَاسٌ يَتَطَهَّرُونَ,And the response of his people was only that they said ‘Expel them that is Lūt and his followers from your city. Surely they are folk who would be pure!’ from the abomination of penetrating the rears of men.
فَأَنجَيْنَاهُ وَأَهْلَهُ إِلاَّ ٱمْرَأَتَهُ كَانَتْ مِنَ ٱلْغَابِرِينَ,So We delivered him and his family except his wife she was of those who stayed behind who remained in the chastisement.
وَأَمْطَرْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ مَّطَراً فَٱنْظُرْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَاقِبَةُ ٱلْمُجْرِمِينَ,And We rained upon them a rain the stones of baked clay hijārat al-sijjīl and it destroyed them. So behold what was the end of the sinners!
وَإِلَىٰ مَدْيَنَ أَخَاهُمْ شُعَيْباً قَالَ يَاقَوْمِ ٱعْبُدُواْ ٱللَّهَ مَا لَكُمْ مِّنْ إِلَـٰهٍ غَيْرُهُ قَدْ جَآءَتْكُمْ بَيِّنَةٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ فَأَوْفُواْ ٱلْكَيْلَ وَٱلْمِيزَانَ وَلاَ تَبْخَسُواْ ٱلنَّاسَ أَشْيَاءَهُمْ وَلاَ تُفْسِدُواْ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ بَعْدَ إِصْلاَحِهَا ذٰلِكُمْ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ مُّؤْمِنِينَ,And We sent to Midian their brother Shu‘ayb. He said ‘O my people worship God! You have no god other than Him. Verily there has come to you a clear proof a miracle from your Lord to prove my truthfulness. So give full measure and weight and do not defraud diminish the value of people’s goods and do not work corruption in the earth by way of unbelief and acts of disobedience after it has been set right through the sending of messengers thereto. That mentioned is better for you if you are believers if you are seekers of faith so hasten to it.
وَلاَ تَقْعُدُواْ بِكُلِّ صِرَاطٍ تُوعِدُونَ وَتَصُدُّونَ عَن سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ مَنْ آمَنَ بِهِ وَتَبْغُونَهَا عِوَجاً وَٱذْكُرُوۤاْ إِذْ كُنْتُمْ قَلِيلاً فَكَثَّرَكُمْ وَٱنْظُرُواْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَاقِبَةُ ٱلْمُفْسِدِينَ,And do not sit in every path every route threatening terrifying people by seizing their garments or by charging them excise tax and barring driving away from God’s way from His religion those who believe in Him — when you threaten to kill them — and desiring that it seeking that the path be crooked. And remember when you were but few and then He multiplied you. And behold what was the end of the agents of corruption before you for denying their messengers that is behold how destruction was the conclusion of their affair.
وَإِن كَانَ طَآئِفَةٌ مِّنكُمْ آمَنُواْ بِٱلَّذِيۤ أُرْسِلْتُ بِهِ وَطَآئِفَةٌ لَّمْ يْؤْمِنُواْ فَٱصْبِرُواْ حَتَّىٰ يَحْكُمَ ٱللَّهُ بَيْنَنَا وَهُوَ خَيْرُ ٱلْحَاكِمِينَ,And if there is a party of you who believe in that with which I have been sent and a party who do not believe in it then be patient wait until God judges between us and you by delivering the affirmer of this truth and destroying the denier of it. He is the best of judges’ the fairest of them.
قَالَ ٱلْمَلأُ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱسْتَكْبَرُواْ مِن قَوْمِهِ لَنُخْرِجَنَّكَ يٰشُعَيْبُ وَٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ مَعَكَ مِن قَرْيَتِنَآ أَوْ لَتَعُودُنَّ فِي مِلَّتِنَا قَالَ أَوَلَوْ كُنَّا كَارِهِينَ,Said the council of those of his people who were disdainful of believing ‘Surely we will expel you O Shu‘ayb and those who believe with you from our city unless you return to our creed’ our religion the plural person predominates over the singular in their address to Shu‘ayb because Shu‘ayb was never part of their religious community; and so in the same plural way he responded He said ‘What should we return to it even though we are averse to it? the interrogative is meant as a disavowal.
قَدِ ٱفْتَرَيْنَا عَلَى ٱللَّهِ كَذِباً إِنْ عُدْنَا فِي مِلَّتِكُمْ بَعْدَ إِذْ نَجَّانَا ٱللَّهُ مِنْهَا وَمَا يَكُونُ لَنَآ أَن نَّعُودَ فِيهَآ إِلاَّ أَن يَشَآءَ ٱللَّهُ رَبُّنَا وَسِعَ رَبُّنَا كُلَّ شَيْءٍ عِلْماً عَلَى ٱللَّهِ تَوَكَّلْنَا رَبَّنَا ٱفْتَحْ بَيْنَنَا وَبَيْنَ قَوْمِنَا بِٱلْحَقِّ وَأَنتَ خَيْرُ ٱلْفَاتِحِينَ,We would be forging a lie against God if we were to return to your creed after God has delivered us from it. It is not right for us to return to it unless God our Lord wills that it be so and forsakes us. Our Lord embraces all things through His knowledge that is to say His knowledge embraces all things including my situation and yours. In God we have put our trust. Our Lord decide adjudicate between us and our people for You are the best of deciders’ adjudicators.
وَقَالَ ٱلْمَلأُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِن قَوْمِهِ لَئِنِ ٱتَّبَعْتُمْ شُعَيْباً إِنَّكُمْ إِذاً لَّخَاسِرُونَ,Said the council of those of his people who disbelieved that is some said to others ‘Verily if la-in the lām is for oaths you follow Shu‘ayb you shall indeed be losers’.
فَأَخَذَتْهُمُ ٱلرَّجْفَةُ فَأَصْبَحُواْ فِي دَارِهِمْ جَاثِمِينَ,So the Trembling the violent earthquake seized them and they lay lifeless prostrate in their habitations keeled over their knees dead.
ٱلَّذِينَ كَذَّبُواْ شُعَيْباً كَأَن لَّمْ يَغْنَوْاْ فِيهَا ٱلَّذِينَ كَذَّبُواْ شُعَيْباً كَانُواْ هُمُ ٱلْخَاسِرِينَ,Those who denied Shu‘ayb alladhīna kadhdhabū Shu‘ayban this constitutes the subject of the sentence the predicate of which is introduced by the following ka-an ‘as if’ it is as if ka-an has been softened its subject omitted in other words understand it as ka-annahum they had never dwelt never had residence there in those dwelling-places of theirs; those who denied Shu‘ayb they were the losers the emphasis effected by the repetition of the relative clause alladhīna kadhdhabū Shu‘ayban ‘those who denied Shu‘ayb’ and what follows it is intended as a refutation of what they had said previously sc. ‘if you follow Shu‘ayb you shall indeed be losers’.
فَتَوَلَّىٰ عَنْهُمْ وَقَالَ يٰقَوْمِ لَقَدْ أَبْلَغْتُكُمْ رِسَـٰلَـٰتِ رَبِّي وَنَصَحْتُ لَكُمْ فَكَيْفَ ءَاسَىٰ عَلَىٰ قَوْمٍ كَٰفِرِينَ,So he turned back on them and said ‘O my people I have conveyed to you the Messages of my Lord and advised you sincerely but you believe not so why should I grieve for a disbelieving people?’ the interrogative is meant rhetorically as a negation.
وَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَا فِي قَرْيَةٍ مِّن نَّبِيٍّ إِلاَّ أَخَذْنَا أَهْلَهَا بِٱلْبَأْسَآءِ وَٱلضَّرَّآءِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَضَّرَّعُونَ,And We did not send a prophet to any city but that when they denied him We seized We punished its people with misery abject poverty and hardship illness so that they might be humble so that they might be self-effaced and so believe.
ثُمَّ بَدَّلْنَا مَكَانَ ٱلسَّيِّئَةِ ٱلْحَسَنَةَ حَتَّىٰ عَفَوْاْ وَّقَالُواْ قَدْ مَسَّ آبَاءَنَا ٱلضَّرَّآءُ وَٱلسَّرَّآءُ فَأَخَذْنَاهُمْ بَغْتَةً وَهُمْ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ,Then We gave them in place of evil the chastisement good wealth and health until they multiplied and said out of ingratitude towards this grace ‘Hardship and happiness befell our fathers before’ just as it has befallen us and this is nothing but the habit of time and not the consequence of God so remain firm in what you follow. God exalted be He says So We seized them with the chastisement suddenly while they perceived not beforehand the time of its coming.
وَلَوْ أَنَّ أَهْلَ ٱلْقُرَىٰ ءَامَنُواْ وَٱتَّقَواْ لَفَتَحْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ بَرَكَٰتٍ مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَلَـٰكِن كَذَّبُواْ فَأَخَذْنَٰهُمْ بِمَا كَانُواْ يَكْسِبُونَ,Yet had the people of the towns the deniers believed in God and the messengers sent to them and been fearful of unbelief and acts of disobedience We would have indeed opened upon them read la-fatahnā or la-fattahnā blessings from the heaven by way of rain and earth by way of vegetation; but they denied the messengers and so We seized them We punished them on account of what they used to earn.
أَفَأَمِنَ أَهْلُ ٱلْقُرَىٰ أَن يَأْتِيَهُمْ بَأْسُنَا بَيَٰتاً وَهُمْ نَآئِمُونَ,Do the people of the towns the deniers feel secure from the coming of Our might Our chastisement upon them at night while they are sleeping? unaware of it?
أَوَ أَمِنَ أَهْلُ ٱلْقُرَىٰ أَن يَأْتِيَهُمْ بَأْسُنَا ضُحًى وَهُمْ يَلْعَبُونَ,Or do the people of the towns feel secure from the coming of Our might upon them in the daytime while they are playing?
أَفَأَمِنُواْ مَكْرَ ٱللَّهِ فَلاَ يَأْمَنُ مَكْرَ ٱللَّهِ إِلاَّ ٱلْقَوْمُ ٱلْخَاسِرُونَ,And so do they feel secure from God’s plotting? that is His drawing them on by degrees through graces and then seizing them suddenly. None feels secure from God’s plotting but the people who are losers.
أَوَلَمْ يَهْدِ لِلَّذِينَ يَرِثُونَ ٱلأَرْضَ مِن بَعْدِ أَهْلِهَآ أَن لَّوْ نَشَآءُ أَصَبْنَاهُمْ بِذُنُوبِهِمْ وَنَطْبَعُ عَلَىٰ قُلُوبِهِمْ فَهُمْ لاَ يَسْمَعُونَ,Has it not been shown has it not become clear to those who inherit the earth as a place of habitation after the destruction of those who inhabited it that an is the softened form and constitutes the subject of the verb its noun having been omitted in other words understand it as annahu if We will We could smite them with chastisement for their sins? as We smote those before them? the hamza in the four instances are meant to indicate rebuke and the particles fa ‘so’ and wa ‘and’ which have been inserted in two instances each are meant to indicate a supplement; a variant reading for a-wa-amina has aw amina ‘or do they feel secure’ in the second instance as a supplement. And We seal up their hearts so that they do not hear the admonition in a way so as to reflect.
تِلْكَ ٱلْقُرَىٰ نَقُصُّ عَلَيْكَ مِنْ أَنبَآئِهَا وَلَقَدْ جَآءَتْهُمْ رُسُلُهُم بِٱلْبَيِّنَٰتِ فَمَا كَانُواْ لِيُؤْمِنُواْ بِمَا كَذَّبُواْ مِن قَبْلُ كَذَٰلِكَ يَطْبَعُ ٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ قُلُوبِ ٱلْكَٰفِرِينَ,Those towns which have been mentioned We relate to you O Muhammad (s) some of their tidings some of the stories of their peoples. Verily their messengers brought them clear proofs manifest miracles but they would not believe when these signscame to them in what they had denied disbelieved in before before these signs came to them; nay they persisted in disbelief. Thus does God seal up the hearts of the disbelievers.
وَمَا وَجَدْنَا لأَكْثَرِهِم مِّنْ عَهْدٍ وَإِن وَجَدْنَآ أَكْثَرَهُمْ لَفَاسِقِينَ,And We did not find in most of them that is people any covenant that is any loyalty to a covenant from the day the pledge was made. Nay wa-in in is softened We found that most of them were indeed wicked.
ثُمَّ بَعَثْنَا مِن بَعْدِهِم مُّوسَىٰ بِآيَٰتِنَآ إِلَىٰ فِرْعَوْنَ وَمَلإِيْهِ فَظَلَمُواْ بِهَا فَٱنْظُرْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَٰقِبَةُ ٱلْمُفْسِدِينَ,Then We sent after them that is after the messengers mentioned Moses with Our nine signs to Pharaoh and his council his folk but they mistreated they disbelieved in them. So behold what was the end of those who work corruption by way of disbelief when they were destroyed.
وَقَالَ مُوسَىٰ يٰفِرْعَوْنُ إِنِّي رَسُولٌ مِّن رَّبِّ ٱلْعَالَمِينَ,And Moses said ‘O Pharaoh I am a messenger from the Lord of the Worlds to you but he denied him. So he Moses said
حَقِيقٌ عَلَىٰ أَنْ لاَّ أَقُولَ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ إِلاَّ ٱلْحَقَّ قَدْ جِئْتُكُمْ بِبَيِّنَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ فَأَرْسِلْ مَعِيَ بَنِيۤ إِسْرَائِيلَ,I am one for whom it is right for whom it is appropriate to say nothing but the truth about God a variant reading for ‘alā has ‘alayya ‘for me’ in which case haqīqun ‘it is right’ is the subject of the sentence its predicate being an ‘that’ and what follows it sc. ‘I say nothing but the truth about God’. Truly I have come to you with a clear proof from your Lord. So send forth with me to Syria the Children of Israel’ he Pharaoh had enslaved them.
قَالَ إِن كُنتَ جِئْتَ بِآيَةٍ فَأْتِ بِهَآ إِن كُنتَ مِنَ ٱلصَّادِقِينَ,Said he Pharaoh to him ‘If you have come with a sign as you claim then produce it if you are of those who speak the truth’ in this.
فَأَلْقَىٰ عَصَاهُ فَإِذَا هِيَ ثُعْبَانٌ مُّبِينٌ,Then he cast down his staff and lo! it was a serpent manifest for all to see an enormous snake.
وَنَزَعَ يَدَهُ فَإِذَا هِيَ بَيْضَآءُ لِلنَّاظِرِينَ,And he drew forth his hand he took it out from his bosom and lo! it was white radiant for the beholders and not its usual skin colour.
قَالَ ٱلْمَلأُ مِن قَوْمِ فِرْعَوْنَ إِنَّ هَـٰذَا لَسَاحِرٌ عَلِيمٌ,The council of Pharaoh’s folk said ‘Surely this man is a cunning sorcerer outstanding in the art of magic in sūrat al-Shu‘arā’ Q. 2634 these are actually Pharaoh’s words and so it is as if they said it in consultation with him
يُرِيدُ أَن يُخْرِجَكُمْ مِّنْ أَرْضِكُمْ فَمَاذَا تَأْمُرُونَ,who would expel you from your land. So what do you command?’
قَالُوۤاْ أَرْجِهْ وَأَخَاهُ وَأَرْسِلْ فِي ٱلْمَدَآئِنِ حَاشِرِينَ,They said ‘Put him and his brother off a while postpone any decision regarding their affair and send into the towns summoners gatherers
يَأْتُوكَ بِكُلِّ سَاحِرٍ عَلِيمٍ,to bring you every cunning sorcerer’ sāhir a variant reading has sahhār to outdo Moses in the art of magic. And so they summoned them.
وَجَآءَ ٱلسَّحَرَةُ فِرْعَوْنَ قَالْوۤاْ إِنَّ لَنَا لأَجْراً إِن كُنَّا نَحْنُ ٱلْغَالِبِينَ,And the sorcerers came to Pharaoh saying ‘Surely a-inna read pronouncing both hamzas or by not pronouncing the second one but inserting an alif between the two in both cases there will be a wage for us if we are the victors?’
قَالَ نَعَمْ وَإِنَّكُمْ لَمِنَ ٱلْمُقَرَّبِينَ,He said ‘Yes and indeed you shall be of those brought near’.
قَالُواْ يٰمُوسَىٰ إِمَّآ أَن تُلْقِيَ وَإِمَّآ أَن نَّكُونَ نَحْنُ ٱلْمُلْقِينَ,They said ‘O Moses either you cast your staff or we shall be the casters!’ of what we have.
قَالَ أَلْقُوْاْ فَلَمَّآ أَلْقَوْاْ سَحَرُوۤاْ أَعْيُنَ ٱلنَّاسِ وَٱسْتَرْهَبُوهُمْ وَجَآءُوا بِسِحْرٍ عَظِيمٍ,He said ‘Cast!’ this is a command permitting them to cast first as a means to manifesting the truth. And when they cast their ropes and staffs they put a spell upon the people’s eyes misleading them from perceiving the real state of these ropes and staffs and overawed them scared them by making them appear to be slithering snakes and produced a mighty sorcery.
وَأَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَىٰ مُوسَىٰ أَنْ أَلْقِ عَصَاكَ فَإِذَا هِيَ تَلْقَفُ مَا يَأْفِكُونَ,And We revealed to Moses saying ‘Cast your staff.’ And lo! it swallowed up read talaqqafu with one of the original tā’ letters of tatalaqqafu omitted the illusion they were creating that which they were transforming by delusion.
فَوَقَعَ ٱلْحَقُّ وَبَطَلَ مَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ,Thus did the truth come to pass thus was it confirmed and made manifest; and that which they were doing in the way of sorcery was proved false.
فَغُلِبُواْ هُنَالِكَ وَٱنقَلَبُواْ صَاغِرِينَ,Thus were they that is Pharaoh and his folk there defeated becoming humiliated — they ended up abased.
وَأُلْقِيَ ٱلسَّحَرَةُ سَاجِدِينَ,And the sorcerers fell down in prostration.
قَالُوۤاْ آمَنَّا بِرَبِّ ٱلْعَالَمِينَ,They said ‘We believe in the Lord of the Worlds
رَبِّ مُوسَىٰ وَهَارُونَ,the Lord of Moses and Aaron’ for they realised that what they had witnessed of the staff could not be done through sorcery.
قَالَ فِرْعَوْنُ آمَنتُمْ بِهِ قَبْلَ أَن آذَنَ لَكُمْ إِنَّ هَـٰذَا لَمَكْرٌ مَّكَرْتُمُوهُ فِي ٱلْمَدِينَةِ لِتُخْرِجُواْ مِنْهَآ أَهْلَهَا فَسَوْفَ تَعْلَمُونَ,Pharaoh said ‘Have you believed a-āmantum read pronouncing both hamzas and replacing the second one with an alif in him in Moses before I gave you leave? Surely this that you have done is a plot you have plotted in the city that you may expel its people from it. But you shall come to know what I will do to you!
لأُقَطِّعَنَّ أَيْدِيَكُمْ وَأَرْجُلَكُمْ مِّنْ خِلاَفٍ ثُمَّ لأُصَلِّبَنَّكُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ,I shall assuredly have your hands and feet cut off on opposite sides that is the right hand and the left foot of every one then I shall have every one of you crucified’.
قَالُوۤاْ إِنَّآ إِلَىٰ رَبِّنَا مُنقَلِبُونَ,They said ‘Surely to our Lord after our death however it come about we shall be restored we shall return in the Hereafter.
وَمَا تَنقِمُ مِنَّآ إِلاَّ أَنْ آمَنَّا بِآيَاتِ رَبِّنَا لَمَّا جَآءَتْنَا رَبَّنَآ أَفْرِغْ عَلَيْنَا صَبْراً وَتَوَفَّنَا مُسْلِمِينَ,You are vindictive spiteful towards us only because we have believed in the signs of our Lord when they came to us. Our Lord pour out onto us patience and constancy when that with which he has threatened us comes to pass lest we revert to unbelief; and take us to You as men who have submitted’.
وَقَالَ ٱلْمَلأُ مِن قَوْمِ فِرْعَونَ أَتَذَرُ مُوسَىٰ وَقَوْمَهُ لِيُفْسِدُواْ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَيَذَرَكَ وَآلِهَتَكَ قَالَ سَنُقَتِّلُ أَبْنَآءَهُمْ وَنَسْتَحْيِـي نِسَآءَهُمْ وَإِنَّا فَوْقَهُمْ قَاهِرُونَ,Then the council of Pharaoh’s folk said to him to Pharaoh ‘Will you leave Moses and his people to work corruption in the land by calling to disobedience against you and flout you and your gods?’ — he had fashioned small idols for them to worship and had said to them ‘I am your lord and their lord’ which is why he says I am your lord the highest Q. 7924. He said ‘We shall slaughter read nuqattilu or naqtulu their new-born sons and spare their women keeping them alive for us as we did with them before. For surely we have irresistible power over them!’ and they did this to them and so the Children of Israel grieved.
قَالَ مُوسَىٰ لِقَوْمِهِ ٱسْتَعِينُوا بِٱللَّهِ وَٱصْبِرُوۤاْ إِنَّ ٱلأَرْضَ لِلَّهِ يُورِثُهَا مَن يَشَآءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ وَٱلْعَاقِبَةُ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ,Moses said to his people ‘Seek help in God and be patient their persecution. Surely the earth is God’s and He bequeaths it He gives it to whom He will from among His servants. The praiseworthy sequel belongs to those who are wary of God’.
قَالُوۤاْ أُوذِينَا مِن قَبْلِ أَن تَأْتِينَا وَمِن بَعْدِ مَا جِئْتَنَا قَالَ عَسَىٰ رَبُّكُمْ أَن يُهْلِكَ عَدُوَّكُمْ وَيَسْتَخْلِفَكُمْ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ فَيَنظُرَ كَيْفَ تَعْمَلُونَ,They said ‘We suffered harm before you came to us and since you have come to us.’ He said ‘Perhaps your Lord will destroy your enemy and make you successors in the land that He may observe how you shall act’ in it.
وَلَقَدْ أَخَذْنَآ آلَ فِرْعَونَ بِٱلسِّنِينَ وَنَقْصٍ مِّن ٱلثَّمَرَاتِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَذَّكَّرُونَ,And verily We seized Pharaoh’s folk with the years of drought and dearth of fruits so that they might remember that they might heed the admonition and become believers.
فَإِذَا جَآءَتْهُمُ ٱلْحَسَنَةُ قَالُواْ لَنَا هَـٰذِهِ وَإِن تُصِبْهُمْ سَيِّئَةٌ يَطَّيَّرُواْ بِمُوسَىٰ وَمَن مَّعَهُ أَلاۤ إِنَّمَا طَائِرُهُمْ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ وَلَـٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَهُمْ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ,But whenever a good thing such as fertility and abundance befell them they said ‘This belongs to us’ that is we deserve it and they did not give thanks for it; and whenever an evil thing such as drought or hardship smote them they would augur ill of Moses and those believers with him. Surely their ill augury is with God Who brings it upon them but most of them do not know that whatever befalls them is from Him.
وَقَالُواْ مَهْمَا تَأْتِنَا بِهِ مِن آيَةٍ لِّتَسْحَرَنَا بِهَا فَمَا نَحْنُ لَكَ بِمُؤْمِنِينَ,And they said to Moses ‘Whatever sign you bring us to cast a spell upon us therewith we will not believe in you’ and so he Moses invoked God against them.
فَأَرْسَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلطُّوفَانَ وَٱلْجَرَادَ وَٱلْقُمَّلَ وَٱلضَّفَادِعَ وَٱلدَّمَ آيَاتٍ مُّفَصَّلاَتٍ فَٱسْتَكْبَرُواْ وَكَانُواْ قَوْماً مُّجْرِمِينَ,So We unleashed upon them the flood of water which penetrated their houses and which for seven days would come up to people’s necks as they sat; and the locusts which consumed their crops and fruits likewise engulfing them for seven days; and the lice al-qummal is like al-sūs ‘woodworm’ or al-qurād ‘ticks’ which would follow and consume what the locusts left behind; and the frogs such that they infested their houses and food supplies; and the blood flowing in their water distinct clear signs but they were too scornful to believe in them and were a sinful folk.
وَلَمَّا وَقَعَ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلرِّجْزُ قَالُواْ يٰمُوسَىٰ ٱدْعُ لَنَا رَبَّكَ بِمَا عَهِدَ عِندَكَ لَئِن كَشَفْتَ عَنَّا ٱلرِّجْزَ لَنُؤْمِنَنَّ لَكَ وَلَنُرْسِلَنَّ مَعَكَ بَنِيۤ إِسْرَآئِيلَ,And when the terror the chastisement fell upon them they said ‘O Moses pray to your Lord for our sake by the covenant which He has made with you to remove the chastisement from us if we believe. Indeed if la-in the lām is for oaths you remove from us the terror verily we will believe in you and let the Children of Israel go with you’.
فَلَماَّ كَشَفْنَا عَنْهُمُ ٱلرِّجْزَ إِلَىٰ أَجَلٍ هُم بَالِغُوهُ إِذَا هُمْ يَنكُثُونَ,But when We removed through the supplication of Moses the terror from them to a term which they should reach lo! they were already reneging breaking their covenant and persisting in their disbelief.
فَٱنْتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَاهُمْ فِي ٱلْيَمِّ بِأَنَّهُمْ كَذَّبُواْ بِآيَاتِنَا وَكَانُواْ عَنْهَا غَافِلِينَ,So We exacted retribution from them and therefore We drowned them in the sea al-yamm denotes salty waters for the reason that they denied Our signs and were heedless of them not reflecting upon them.
وَأَوْرَثْنَا ٱلْقَوْمَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَانُواْ يُسْتَضْعَفُونَ مَشَارِقَ ٱلأَرْضِ وَمَغَارِبَهَا ٱلَّتِي بَارَكْنَا فِيهَا وَتَمَّتْ كَلِمَةُ رَبِّكَ ٱلْحُسْنَىٰ عَلَىٰ بَنِيۤ إِسْرَآئِيلَ بِمَا صَبَرُواْ وَدَمَّرْنَا مَا كَانَ يَصْنَعُ فِرْعَوْنُ وَقَوْمُهُ وَمَا كَانُواْ يَعْرِشُونَ,And We bequeathed upon the people who were oppressed through bondage namely the Children of Israel the eastern parts of the land and the western parts thereof which We had blessed with water and trees allatī bāraknā fīhā ‘which We had blessed’ is an adjectival qualification of al-ard ‘the land’ and this was Syria and the fair word of your Lord was fulfilled which was His saying exalted be He Yet We desired to be gracious to those who were oppressed in the land... to the end of the verse Q. 285 for the Children of Israel because they endured patiently persecution at the hands of their enemy; and We destroyed utterly what Pharaoh and his folk had been creating by way of architecture and what they had been erecting read ya‘rishūn or ya‘rushūn what they had been raising of edifices.
وَجَاوَزْنَا بِبَنِيۤ إِسْرَآئِيلَ ٱلْبَحْرَ فَأَتَوْاْ عَلَىٰ قَوْمٍ يَعْكُفُونَ عَلَىٰ أَصْنَامٍ لَّهُمْ قَالُواْ يٰمُوسَىٰ ٱجْعَلْ لَّنَآ إِلَـٰهاً كَمَا لَهُمْ آلِهَةٌ قَالَ إِنَّكُمْ قَوْمٌ تَجْهَلُونَ,And We brought the Children of Israel across the sea and they came upon they passed by a people cleaving in devotion read ya‘kufūn or ya‘kifūn to idols they had constantly worshipping them. They said ‘O Moses make for us a god an idol for us to worship just as they have gods.’ He said ‘Truly you are an ignorant folk for repaying God’s grace to you with what you have said.
إِنَّ هَـٰؤُلاۤءِ مُتَبَّرٌ مَّا هُمْ فِيهِ وَبَاطِلٌ مَّا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ,Truly as for these their way will be destroyed and what they have been doing is in vain’.
قَالَ أَغَيْرَ ٱللَّهِ أَبْغِيكُمْ إِلَـٰهاً وَهُوَ فَضَّلَكُمْ عَلَى ٱلْعَالَمِينَ,He said ‘Shall I seek other than God as a god for you to worship abghīkum ‘shall I seek for you’ is originally abghī lakum when He has favoured you above all the worlds?’ of your time in the ways He has mentioned in His sayings?
وَإِذْ أَنْجَيْنَاكُمْ مِّنْ آلِ فِرْعَونَ يَسُومُونَكُمْ سُوۤءَ ٱلْعَذَابِ يُقَتِّلُونَ أَبْنَآءَكُمْ وَيَسْتَحْيُونَ نِسَآءَكُمْ وَفِي ذٰلِكُمْ بَلاۤءٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ عَظِيمٌ,And remember when We delivered you anjaynākum a variant reading has anjākum ‘He delivered you’ from Pharaoh’s folk who were inflicting upon you who were burdening you and making you taste terrible chastisement the worst kind of chastisement namely slaying your sons and sparing retaining your women; and therein in that deliverance or chastisement was a tremendous trial either a grace or a tribulation from your Lord so will you not heed the admonition and desist from what you are saying?
وَوَاعَدْنَا مُوسَىٰ ثَلاَثِينَ لَيْلَةً وَأَتْمَمْنَاهَا بِعَشْرٍ فَتَمَّ مِيقَاتُ رَبِّهِ أَرْبَعِينَ لَيْلَةً وَقَالَ مُوسَىٰ لأَخِيهِ هَارُونَ ٱخْلُفْنِي فِي قَوْمِي وَأَصْلِحْ وَلاَ تَتَّبِعْ سَبِيلَ ٱلْمُفْسِدِينَ,And We appointed read wa-wā‘adnā or wa-wa‘adnā for Moses thirty nights at the end of which We would speak to him after he has fasted during that period; that was the month of Dhū’l-Qa‘da. He completed the fast. But when it came to an end he disliked the bad odour of his mouth and so cleaned his teeth. God then commanded him to fast for another ten nights so that He may speak to him despite the odour in his mouth as God says and completed them with ten nights of Dhū’l-Hijja. Thus was the time appointed by his Lord concluded the time at which God had promised him to speak to him as forty arba‘īna is a circumstantial qualifier nights laylatan is for specification; and Moses said to his brother Aaron when he was departing to the Mount for the communion with his Lord ‘Succeed me be my deputy over my people and be righteous among them with regard to their affair and do not follow the way of the agents of corruption’ by consenting with them to acts of disobedience.
وَلَمَّا جَآءَ مُوسَىٰ لِمِيقَاتِنَا وَكَلَّمَهُ رَبُّهُ قَالَ رَبِّ أَرِنِيۤ أَنظُرْ إِلَيْكَ قَالَ لَن تَرَانِي وَلَـٰكِنِ انْظُرْ إِلَى الْجَبَلِ فَإِنِ اسْتَقَرَّ مَكَانَهُ فَسَوْفَ تَرَانِي فَلَمَّا تَجَلَّىٰ رَبُّهُ لِلْجَبَلِ جَعَلَهُ دَكّاً وَخَرَّ موسَىٰ صَعِقاً فَلَمَّآ أَفَاقَ قَالَ سُبْحَانَكَ تُبْتُ إِلَيْكَ وَأَنَاْ أَوَّلُ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,And when Moses came at Our appointed time that is the time at which We had promised to speak to him and his Lord spoke with him without any intermediary with speech which he heard from all directions he said ‘My Lord! Show me Yourself that I may behold You!’ Said He ‘You shall not see Me that is to say you do not have the power to see me the use of this expression lan tarānī ‘you shall not see Me’ instead of lan urā ‘I shall not be seen’ implies that it is possible to see God exalted be He; but behold the mountain which is stronger than you are and if it remains stays fixed in its place then you shall see Me’ that is then you shall remain fixed able to see Me otherwise you will not have the capacity for it. And when his Lord revealed Himself that is when He manifested of His Light the equivalent of half a nail of a little finger as stated in one hadīth verified by al-Hākim to the mountain He levelled it to the ground read dakkan or dakkā’a meaning madkūkan and Moses fell down senseless having lost consciousness at the awesomeness of what he had seen. And when he recovered his senses he said ‘Glory be to You! in Your transcendence. I repent to You for having asked You what I was not commanded to ask and I am the first of the believers’ of my time.
قَالَ يٰمُوسَىٰ إِنِّي ٱصْطَفَيْتُكَ عَلَى ٱلنَّاسِ بِرِسَالاَتِي وَبِكَلاَمِي فَخُذْ مَآ آتَيْتُكَ وَكُنْ مِّنَ ٱلشَّاكِرِينَ,He God said to him ‘O Moses I have elected you chosen you from among mankind the people of your time for My Messages read plural bi-risālātī or singular bi-risālatī ‘for My Message’ and My Speech that is for My having spoken to you. So take what I have given you of bounty and be of the thankful’ of My favours.
وَكَتَبْنَا لَهُ فِي ٱلأَلْوَاحِ مِن كُلِّ شَيْءٍ مَّوْعِظَةً وَتَفْصِيلاً لِّكُلِّ شَيْءٍ فَخُذْهَا بِقُوَّةٍ وَأْمُرْ قَوْمَكَ يَأْخُذُواْ بِأَحْسَنِهَا سَأُوْرِيكُمْ دَارَ ٱلْفَاسِقِينَ,And We inscribed for him in the Tablets that is the Tablets of the Torah — these were made from the Lote-tree of Paradise or of chrysolite or emerald and they were either seven or ten — about all things one needs in religion as an admonition and a detailing an explanation of all things li-kulli shay’in substitutes for the previous genitive construction min kulli shay’ ‘about all things’. ‘Take it then there is an implicit qulnā ‘We said’ before this fa-kudhhā ‘take it then’ firmly seriously and earnestly and enjoin your people to adhere to the fairest precepts in it. I shall show you the abode of the wicked of Pharaoh and his followers and that is Egypt that you may take an example from them.
سَأَصْرِفُ عَنْ آيَاتِي ٱلَّذِينَ يَتَكَبَّرُونَ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ بِغَيْرِ ٱلْحَقِّ وَإِن يَرَوْاْ كُلَّ آيَةٍ لاَّ يُؤْمِنُواْ بِهَا وَإِن يَرَوْاْ سَبِيلَ ٱلرُّشْدِ لاَ يَتَّخِذُوهُ سَبِيلاً وَإِن يَرَوْاْ سَبِيلَ ٱلْغَيِّ يَتَّخِذُوهُ سَبِيلاً ذٰلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ كَذَّبُواْ بِآيَاتِنَا وَكَانُواْ عَنْهَا غَافِلِينَ,I shall turn away from My signs the proofs of My power in the way of creations and otherwise those who behave arrogantly in the earth without right by humiliating them so that they do not magnify themselves; and if they see every sign do not believe in it and if they see the way the path of rectitude the guidance that has come from God do not adopt it as a way to follow and if they see the way of error misguidance adopt it as a way. That turning of them away is because they have denied Our signs and were heedless of them. A similar statement has been made above.
وَٱلَّذِينَ كَذَّبُواْ بِآيَاتِنَا وَلِقَآءِ ٱلآخِرَةِ حَبِطَتْ أَعْمَالُهُمْ هَلْ يُجْزَوْنَ إِلاَّ مَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ,Those who deny Our signs and the encounter in the Hereafter the Resurrection and so on. their works the good deeds they performed in the world such as the maintenance of kinship ties or voluntary almsgivings have failed are invalid and will not be rewarded since they are not binding in this case. Shall they they shall not be requited anything but the requital for what they used to do?’ in the way of denial and acts of disobedience?
وَٱتَّخَذَ قَوْمُ مُوسَىٰ مِن بَعْدِهِ مِنْ حُلِيِّهِمْ عِجْلاً جَسَداً لَّهُ خُوَارٌ أَلَمْ يَرَوْاْ أَنَّهُ لاَ يُكَلِّمُهُمْ وَلاَ يَهْدِيهِمْ سَبِيلاً ٱتَّخَذُوهُ وَكَانُواْ ظَالِمِينَ,And the people of Moses after him that is after he had departed for the communion with God made of their ornaments which they had borrowed from Pharaoh’s folk on the pretext of a wedding celebration and which remained in their possession a calf which the Samaritan had fashioned for them therefrom; a mere living body jasadan is a substitution for ‘ijlan ‘a calf’ of flesh and blood which lowed that is which made audible sounds like a cow it the calf was transformed in this way when the dust which he the Samaritan had collected from where the hoof of Gabriel’s steed had trodden was placed in its mouth for it has the effect of giving life to that in which it is placed the second direct object of the verb ittakhadha ‘they made’ has been omitted but it would be ilāhan ‘as a god’. Did they not see that it spoke not to them nor guided them to any way? so how can it be taken as a god? Yet they took it as such a god and were evildoers for taking it so.
وَلَمَّا سُقِطَ فِيۤ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَرَأَوْاْ أَنَّهُمْ قَدْ ضَلُّواْ قَالُواْ لَئِن لَّمْ يَرْحَمْنَا رَبُّنَا وَيَغْفِرْ لَنَا لَنَكُونَنَّ مِنَ ٱلْخَاسِرِينَ,And when they became at a loss that is when they became remorseful for having worshipped it and saw and realised that they had gone astray thereby and this was after Moses’s return from the communion they said ‘Unless our Lord is merciful to us and forgives us read both verbs either in the third person singular or in the second person singular verily we shall be among the losers’.
وَلَمَّا رَجَعَ مُوسَىٰ إِلَىٰ قَوْمِهِ غَضْبَٰنَ أَسِفاً قَالَ بِئْسَمَا خَلَفْتُمُونِي مِن بَعْدِيۤ أَعَجِلْتُمْ أَمْرَ رَبِّكُمْ وَأَلْقَى ٱلأَلْوَاحَ وَأَخَذَ بِرَأْسِ أَخِيهِ يَجُرُّهُ إِلَيْهِ قَالَ ٱبْنَ أُمَّ إِنَّ ٱلْقَوْمَ ٱسْتَضْعَفُونِي وَكَادُواْ يَقْتُلُونَنِي فَلاَ تُشْمِتْ بِيَ ٱلأَعْدَآءَ وَلاَ تَجْعَلْنِي مَعَ ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ,And when Moses returned to his people angry because of them and bitterly grieved he said to them ‘Evil is that that is evil is the manner of succession which you have followed in my place after I had gone this idolatry of yours. Would you hasten on the judgement of your Lord?’ And he cast down the Tablets the Tablets of the Torah angry for the sake of his Lord and they were broken into pieces and he seized his brother by the head that is by the hair with his right hand and seized him by the beard with his left hand dragging him toward him in anger. He said ‘O son of my mother! read either ibna ummi or ibna umma by which he meant the standard form of saying ‘my mother’ ummī the mention of her is more affectionate in appealing to his heart Truly the people judged me weak and they were close to killing me. Do not make my enemies gloat over my misfortune to rejoice thereat by your humiliating me and do not count me among the folk who have done evil’ by worshipping the calf in your reproach of them.
قَالَ رَبِّ ٱغْفِرْ لِي وَلأَخِي وَأَدْخِلْنَا فِي رَحْمَتِكَ وَأَنتَ أَرْحَمُ ٱلرَّاحِمِينَ,He said ‘My Lord forgive me what I have done to my brother and my brother he includes him in the supplication in order to reconcile him and to fend off any gloating over his misfortune and admit us into Your mercy for You are the Most Merciful of the merciful’.
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱتَّخَذُواْ ٱلْعِجْلَ سَيَنَالُهُمْ غَضَبٌ مِّن رَّبِّهِمْ وَذِلَّةٌ فِي ٱلْحَياةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَكَذَلِكَ نَجْزِي ٱلْمُفْتَرِينَ,God exalted be He says ‘Surely those who chose the calf as a god. wrath chastisement and abasement shall come upon them from their Lord in the life of this world and so they were punished for this deed by the command to slay themselves and abasement was stamped upon them until the Day of Resurrection. Even as We have requited them so We requite those who invent lies against God by way of idolatry and otherwise.
وَٱلَّذِينَ عَمِلُواْ ٱلسَّيِّئَاتِ ثُمَّ تَابُواْ مِن بَعْدِهَا وَآمَنُوۤاْ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ مِن بَعْدِهَا لَغَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,But those who commit evil deeds and repent desist from them thereafter and believe in God — indeed your Lord thereafter that is after repentance is truly Forgiving Merciful’ towards them.
وَلَماَّ سَكَتَ عَن مُّوسَى ٱلْغَضَبُ أَخَذَ ٱلأَلْوَاحَ وَفِي نُسْخَتِهَا هُدًى وَرَحْمَةٌ لِّلَّذِينَ هُمْ لِرَبِّهِمْ يَرْهَبُونَ,And when Moses’s anger abated subsided he took the Tablets which he had cast down and in their copy that is in what was inscribed upon them — in other words it was written that there was guidance from error and mercy for all those who hold their Lord in awe who have fear of Him the lām in li-rabbihim ‘their Lord’ has been inserted into the direct object because it the direct object has preceded the verb.
وَٱخْتَارَ مُوسَىٰ قَوْمَهُ سَبْعِينَ رَجُلاً لِّمِيقَاتِنَا فَلَمَّا أَخَذَتْهُمُ ٱلرَّجْفَةُ قَالَ رَبِّ لَوْ شِئْتَ أَهْلَكْتَهُمْ مِّن قَبْلُ وَإِيَّايَ أَتُهْلِكُنَا بِمَا فَعَلَ ٱلسُّفَهَآءُ مِنَّآ إِنْ هِيَ إِلاَّ فِتْنَتُكَ تُضِلُّ بِهَا مَن تَشَآءُ وَتَهْدِي مَن تَشَآءُ أَنتَ وَلِيُّنَا فَٱغْفِرْ لَنَا وَٱرْحَمْنَا وَأَنتَ خَيْرُ ٱلْغَافِرِينَ,And Moses chose of his people seventy men from among those who had not worshipped the calf by God’s command for Our appointed time that is for the time at which We promised him that they should come and apologise for their comrades’ worship of the calf. He Moses then departed with them; but when the Trembling a violent earthquake seized them Ibn ‘Abbās said ‘That earthquake was because they did not separate themselves from their people when the latter took to worshipping the calf’; he Ibn ‘Abbās added ‘These people were not the same ones who asked to see God and were struck by the thunderbolt cf. Q. 255’ he Moses said ‘My Lord had You willed You would have destroyed them long before that is before my departure with them so that the Children of Israel might see this and not make false accusations against me and me with them. Will You destroy us for what the foolish ones among us have done? this interrogative is meant as a plea for compassion in other words ‘Do not punish us for the sins of others’. It that is the trial which the ignorant ones underwent is but Your trial Your test whereby You send astray whom You will to lead stray and guide whom You will to guide. You are our Protector looking after our affairs so forgive us and have mercy on us for You are the Best of all who show forgiveness.
وَٱكْتُبْ لَنَا فِي هَـٰذِهِ ٱلدُّنْيَا حَسَنَةً وَفِي ٱلآخِرَةِ إِنَّا هُدْنَـآ إِلَيْكَ قَالَ عَذَابِيۤ أُصِيبُ بِهِ مَنْ أَشَآءُ وَرَحْمَتِي وَسِعَتْ كُلَّ شَيْءٍ فَسَأَكْتُبُهَا لِلَّذِينَ يَتَّقُونَ وَيُؤْتُونَ ٱلزَّكَـاةَ وَٱلَّذِينَ هُم بِآيَاتِنَا يُؤْمِنُونَ,And prescribe for us grant us in this world good and in the Hereafter good. We have turned repented to You’. He God says ‘My chastisement — I smite with it whom I will to chastise and My mercy embraces subsumes all things in this world and so I shall prescribe it in the Hereafter for those who are God-fearing and pay the alms and those who believe in Our signs;
ٱلَّذِينَ يَتَّبِعُونَ ٱلرَّسُولَ ٱلنَّبِيَّ ٱلأُمِّيَّ ٱلَّذِي يَجِدُونَهُ مَكْتُوباً عِندَهُمْ فِي ٱلتَّوْرَاةِ وَٱلإِنْجِيلِ يَأْمُرُهُم بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ وَيَنْهَاهُمْ عَنِ ٱلْمُنْكَرِ وَيُحِلُّ لَهُمُ ٱلطَّيِّبَاتِ وَيُحَرِّمُ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلْخَبَآئِثَ وَيَضَعُ عَنْهُمْ إِصْرَهُمْ وَٱلأَغْلاَلَ ٱلَّتِي كَانَتْ عَلَيْهِمْ فَٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ بِهِ وَعَزَّرُوهُ وَنَصَرُوهُ وَٱتَّبَعُواْ ٱلنُّورَ ٱلَّذِيۤ أُنزِلَ مَعَهُ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْمُفْلِحُونَ,those who follow the Messenger the uninstructed Prophet Muhammad (s) whom they will find inscribed in their Torah and Gospel in name and description enjoining them to decency and forbidding them indecency making lawful for them the good things which were forbidden to them by their Law and making unlawful for them the vile things such as carrion and the like and relieving them of their burden their onus and the shackles the hardships that they used to bear such as the requirement to kill oneself as a repentance and the severing of that part that had come into contact with any impurity. Then those who believe in him from among them and honour revere him and help him and follow the light that has been revealed with him namely the Qur’ān they are the ones who will prosper’.
قُلْ يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّاسُ إِنِّي رَسُولُ ٱللَّهِ إِلَيْكُمْ جَمِيعاً ٱلَّذِي لَهُ مُلْكُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ لاۤ إِلَـٰهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ يُحْيِـي وَيُمِيتُ فَآمِنُواْ بِٱللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ ٱلنَّبِيِّ ٱلأُمِّيِّ ٱلَّذِي يُؤْمِنُ بِٱللَّهِ وَكَلِمَاتِهِ وَٱتَّبِعُوهُ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَهْتَدُونَ,Say addressing the Prophet s here ‘O mankind I am the Messenger of God to you all the Messenger of Him to Whom belongs the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth. There is no god but Him. He gives life and makes to die. Believe then in God and His Messenger the uninstructed Prophet who believes in God and His words the Qur’ān and follow him so that you might be guided led aright.
وَمِن قَوْمِ مُوسَىٰ أُمَّةٌ يَهْدُونَ بِٱلْحَقِّ وَبِهِ يَعْدِلُونَ,And among the people of Moses there is a community a group who guide people by the truth and act justly according to it when passing judgements.
وَقَطَّعْنَاهُمُ ٱثْنَتَيْ عَشْرَةَ أَسْبَاطاً أُمَماً وَأَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَىٰ مُوسَىٰ إِذِ ٱسْتَسْقَاهُ قَوْمُهُ أَنِ ٱضْرِب بِّعَصَاكَ ٱلْحَجَرَ فَٱنبَجَسَتْ مِنْهُ ٱثْنَتَا عَشْرَةَ عَيْناً قَدْ عَلِمَ كُلُّ أُنَاسٍ مَّشْرَبَهُمْ وَظَلَّلْنَا عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلْغَمَامَ وَأَنْزَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلْمَنَّ وَٱلسَّلْوَىٰ كُلُواْ مِن طَيِّبَاتِ مَا رَزَقْنَاكُمْ وَمَا ظَلَمُونَا وَلَـٰكِن كَانُوۤاْ أَنْفُسَهُمْ يَظْلِمُونَ,And We divided them We separated the Children of Israel into twelve ithnatay ‘asharata is a circumstantial qualifier tribes asbātan substitutes for this previous circumstantial qualifier communities umaman substitutes for the preceding asbātan ‘tribes’. And We revealed to Moses when his people asked him for water in the wilderness saying ‘Strike the rock with your staff’ and he struck it and there gushed forth burst forth from it twelve fountains equal to the number of tribes each people each tribe among them now knew their drinking-place. And We made the cloud overshadow them in the wilderness from the heat of the sun and We sent down to them manna and quails — which are respectively a type of citrus turunjabīn and the quail and We said to them ‘Eat of the good things We have provided for you.’ And they did not wrong Us but they wronged themselves.
وَإِذْ قِيلَ لَهُمُ ٱسْكُنُواْ هَـٰذِهِ ٱلْقَرْيَةَ وَكُلُواْ مِنْهَا حَيْثُ شِئْتُمْ وَقُولُواْ حِطَّةٌ وَٱدْخُلُواْ ٱلْبَابَ سُجَّداً نَّغْفِرْ لَكُمْ خَطِيۤئَاتِكُمْ سَنَزِيدُ ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,And mention when it was said to them ‘Dwell in this city the Holy House of Jerusalem and eat therein wherever you will and say ‘our concern is for an Exoneration’ and enter the gate that is the gate of the city prostrating a prostration that is actually a bow. We shall forgive read naghfir or the passive tughfar you your transgressions; We shall give more to those who are virtuous through obedience in terms of reward.
فَبَدَّلَ ٱلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ مِنْهُمْ قَوْلاً غَيْرَ ٱلَّذِي قِيلَ لَهُمْ فَأَرْسَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ رِجْزاً مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ بِمَا كَانُواْ يَظْلِمُونَ,But the evildoers among them substituted a saying other than that which had been said to them they said instead ‘A grain inside a hair’ and entered the gate dragging themselves on their rears. So We sent down upon them terror a chastisement from the heaven for their evildoing.
وَسْئَلْهُمْ عَنِ ٱلْقَرْيَةِ ٱلَّتِي كَانَتْ حَاضِرَةَ ٱلْبَحْرِ إِذْ يَعْدُونَ فِي ٱلسَّبْتِ إِذْ تَأْتِيهِمْ حِيتَانُهُمْ يَوْمَ سَبْتِهِمْ شُرَّعاً وَيَوْمَ لاَ يَسْبِتُونَ لاَ تَأْتِيهِمْ كَذَلِكَ نَبْلُوهُم بِمَا كَانُوا يَفْسُقُونَ,And question them O Muhammad (s) in rebuke about the city that was by the sea bordering the Red Sea bahr al-qulzum and this was Eilat about what befell its inhabitants how they would transgress violate the Sabbath by fishing which they had been commanded not to do on that day; how idh is an adverbial qualifier of ya‘dūn ‘they would transgress’ their fish would come to them on the day of their Sabbath floating at the surface visible at the surface of the water; but on the day they did not observe the Sabbath when they would not consecrate the Sabbath over the other days they would not come to them as a trial from God. Thus were We trying them for their wickedness. And when they went to fish the city split into three one third joined the fishing party another prohibited them while a third abstained from both fishing and prohibiting.
وَإِذْ قَالَتْ أُمَّةٌ مِّنْهُمْ لِمَ تَعِظُونَ قَوْماً ٱللَّهُ مُهْلِكُهُمْ أَوْ مُعَذِّبُهُمْ عَذَاباً شَدِيداً قَالُواْ مَعْذِرَةً إِلَىٰ رَبِّكُمْ وَلَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَّقُونَ,And when wa-idh is a supplement to the preceding idh ‘how’ a community among them who neither fished nor prohibited it said to those who prohibited it ‘Why do you preach admonition to a folk whom God is about to destroy or chastise with a severe chastisement?’ They said our admonishing them is ‘As an exculpation by which we excuse ourselves before your Lord lest we are reproached for failing to prohibit them in any way; and so that they might be wary of fishing’.
فَلَماَّ نَسُواْ مَا ذُكِّرُواْ بِهِ أَنجَيْنَا ٱلَّذِينَ يَنْهَوْنَ عَنِ ٱلسُوۤءِ وَأَخَذْنَا ٱلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ بِعَذَابٍ بَئِيسٍ بِمَا كَانُواْ يَفْسُقُونَ,And when they forgot when they overlooked that whereof they had been reminded that for which they had been admonished and did not desist We delivered those who forbade evil and seized those who did wrong through transgression with a grievous terrible chastisement for their wickedness.
فَلَماَّ عَتَوْاْ عَن مَّا نُهُواْ عَنْهُ قُلْنَا لَهُمْ كُونُواْ قِرَدَةً خَاسِئِينَ,And when they disdained to desist from that which was prohibited to them We said to them ‘Be apes despised!’ abased and they became so this is an explication of what preceded with regard to the details of their ‘grievous chastisement’. Ibn ‘Abbās said ‘I do not know what befell the group that abstained’. ‘Ikrima said ‘That group was not destroyed because they had been averse to what the others did and had said ‘Why do you preach admonition …’ Al-Hākim reported in a hadīth that he ‘Ikrima referred this opinion to Ibn ‘Abbās who was delighted by it.
وَإِذْ تَأَذَّنَ رَبُّكَ لَيَبْعَثَنَّ عَلَيْهِمْ إِلَىٰ يَوْمِ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ مَن يَسُومُهُمْ سُوۤءَ ٱلْعَذَابِ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَسَرِيعُ ٱلْعِقَابِ وَإِنَّهُ لَغَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,And when your Lord proclaimed made it known that He would send against them that is the Jews to the Day of Resurrection those who would inflict on them grievous torment through humiliation and the exacting of the jizya-tax from them. Thus God sent Solomon against them and after him Nebuchadnezzar who slaughtered some of them and took others among them captive and imposed the jizya-tax on them. They continued to pay this tax to the Magians up until the time of the sending of our Prophet s who also imposed it on them. Lo! verily your Lord is swift in requital of those who disobey Him. And lo! verily He is Forgiving to those who obey Him Merciful in dealing with them.
وَقَطَّعْنَاهُمْ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ أُمَماً مِّنْهُمُ ٱلصَّالِحُونَ وَمِنْهُمْ دُونَ ذٰلِكَ وَبَلَوْنَاهُمْ بِٱلْحَسَنَاتِ وَٱلسَّيِّئَاتِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ,And We divided them We separated them into communities sects in the earth. Some of them are righteous and some of them people who are otherwise disbelievers and wicked individuals. And We tried them with good things with graces and evil things with misfortunes so that they might revert from their wickedness.
فَخَلَفَ مِن بَعْدِهِمْ خَلْفٌ وَرِثُواْ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ يَأْخُذُونَ عَرَضَ هَـٰذَا ٱلأَدْنَىٰ وَيَقُولُونَ سَيُغْفَرُ لَنَا وَإِن يَأْتِهِمْ عَرَضٌ مِّثْلُهُ يَأْخُذُوهُ أَلَمْ يُؤْخَذْ عَلَيْهِمْ مِّيثَٰقُ ٱلْكِتَٰبِ أَن لاَّ يِقُولُواْ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ إِلاَّ ٱلْحَقَّ وَدَرَسُواْ مَا فِيهِ وَٱلدَّارُ ٱلآخِرَةُ خَيْرٌ لِّلَّذِينَ يَتَّقُونَ أَفَلاَ تَعْقِلُونَ,And there succeeded after them a generation who inherited the Scripture the Torah from their forefathers choosing the transient things of this inferior life that is the ephemeral aspects of this lowly thing that the world is in the way of what is lawful and what is unlawful and saying ‘It will be forgiven us’ what we have done; and yet if similar transient things were to come to them they would take them wa-in ya’tihim ‘aradun mithluhu ya’khudhūhu this sentence is a circumstantial qualifier in other words they hope for forgiveness whilst committing the same offence again and persisting in it and in the Torah there is no such promise about forgiveness for persistence in sin. Has not the covenant of the Scripture mīthāqu l-kitābi the annexation functions in place of fī ‘in’ sc. ‘the covenant in the Scripture’ been taken a-lam yu’khadh ‘has it not been taken’ is an interrogative meant as an affirmative from them that they should not say about God anything but the truth? And they have studied wa-darasū is a supplement to yu’khadh ‘has it not been taken?’ they have read what is in it so why do they impute lies to it the Scripture by ascribing to it the idea of forgiveness for persistence in sin? And the Abode of the Hereafter is better for those who are wary of what is unlawful. Do they not understand? ya‘qilūn may also be read as ta‘qilūn ‘do you not understand?’ that it is better and so prefer it to the abode of this world?
وَٱلَّذِينَ يُمَسِّكُونَ بِٱلْكِتَابِ وَأَقَامُواْ ٱلصَّلاَةَ إِنَّا لاَ نُضِيعُ أَجْرَ ٱلْمُصْلِحِينَ,And those who adhere read yumassikūn or yumsikūn to the Scripture from among them and have established prayer the likes of ‘Abd Allāh b. Salām and his companions verily We shall not let the wages of reformers go to waste innā lā nudī‘u ajra l-muslihīn the sentence is the predicate of alladhīna ‘those who’; also there is here the replacing of the third person pronominalisation alladhīna ‘those who’ with an overt noun al-muslihīna ‘reformers’ in other words their wages.
وَإِذ نَتَقْنَا ٱلْجَبَلَ فَوْقَهُمْ كَأَنَّهُ ظُلَّةٌ وَظَنُّوۤاْ أَنَّهُ وَاقِعٌ بِهِمْ خُذُواْ مَآ ءَاتَيْنَٰكُم بِقُوَّةٍ وَٱذْكُرُواْ مَا فِيهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ,And mention when We wrenched the mountain above them We lifted it up unearthing it from its root as if it were a canopy and they thought they were certain that it was about to fall upon them because of God’s threat to them that it would fall upon them if they refused to accept the rulings contained in the Torah they had initially refused to accept them because of their being burdensome but then accepted them and We said to them ‘Take firmly seriously and earnestly what We have given you and remember what is in it by acting in accordance with it that you might be God-fearing’.
وَإِذْ أَخَذَ رَبُّكَ مِن بَنِيۤ ءَادَمَ مِن ظُهُورِهِمْ ذُرِّيَّتَهُمْ وَأَشْهَدَهُمْ عَلَىٰ أَنفُسِهِمْ أَلَسْتُ بِرَبِّكُمْ قَالُواْ بَلَىٰ شَهِدْنَآ أَن تَقُولُواْ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ إِنَّا كُنَّا عَنْ هَـٰذَا غَافِلِينَ,And remember when your Lord took from the Children of Adam from their loins min zuhūrihim is an inclusive substitution for the preceding clause min banī Ādama ‘from the Children of Adam’ with the same preposition min ‘from’ their seed by bringing forth one from the loins of the other all from the loins of Adam offspring after offspring in the way that they multiply looking like small ants at the valley of Na‘mān on the Day of ‘Arafa because of their multitude. God set up proofs of His Lordship for them and endowed them with the faculty of reason and made them testify against themselves saying ‘Am I not your Lord?’ They said ‘Yea indeed You are our Lord we testify’ to this and this taking of testimony is lest they should say in both instances read third person yaqūlū ‘they say’ or second person taqūlū ‘you say’ on the Day of Resurrection ‘Truly of this Oneness of God we were unaware’ not knowing it!
أَوْ تَقُولُوۤاْ إِنَّمَآ أَشْرَكَ آبَاؤُنَا مِن قَبْلُ وَكُنَّا ذُرِّيَّةً مِّن بَعْدِهِمْ أَفَتُهْلِكُنَا بِمَا فَعَلَ ٱلْمُبْطِلُونَ,Or lest you should say ‘It is merely that our fathers were idolaters before that is before our time and we were descendants of theirs and so we followed their example. Will You then destroy us chastise us for that which those who follow falsehood did?’ from among our forefathers by their establishing idolatry? The meaning is they cannot use such arguments when they have been made to testify before their very selves to God’s Oneness. To effect this reminder by the tongue of the bearer of the miracle Muhammad (s) equally serves as a reminder for every soul to remember this within itself.
وَكَذٰلِكَ نُفَصِّلُ ٱلآيَاتِ وَلَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ,Thus We detail the signs We explain them even as We have explained the covenant that they might reflect on them and that they might revert from their disbelief.
وَٱتْلُ عَلَيْهِمْ نَبَأَ ٱلَّذِي ۤ ءَاتَيْنَاهُ ءَايَاتِنَا فَٱنْسَلَخَ مِنْهَا فَأَتْبَعَهُ ٱلشَّيْطَانُ فَكَانَ مِنَ ٱلْغَاوِينَ,And recite O Muhammad (s) to them that is the Jews the tidings the tale of him to whom We gave Our signs but he cast them off emerging in his disbelief in the same way that a snake emerges from its shed skin he rebelled in disbelief this was Bal‘am b. Bā‘ūrā’ a scholar from among the Children of Israel who had been given some knowledge of the Scriptures and who was asked by them to invoke God against Moses. And when he did the invocation turned against him and his tongue fell out onto his chest and Satan pursued him catching up with him and so he became his comrade and he became of the perverse.
وَلَوْ شِئْنَا لَرَفَعْنَاهُ بِهَا وَلَـٰكِنَّهُ أَخْلَدَ إِلَى ٱلأَرْضِ وَٱتَّبَعَ هَوَاهُ فَمَثَلُهُ كَمَثَلِ ٱلْكَلْبِ إِن تَحْمِلْ عَلَيْهِ يَلْهَثْ أَوْ تَتْرُكْهُ يَلْهَث ذَّلِكَ مَثَلُ ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلَّذِينَ كَذَّبُواْ بِآيَاتِنَا فَٱقْصُصِ ٱلْقَصَصَ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَفَكَّرُونَ,And had We willed We would have raised him up to the ranks of the scholars thereby by facilitating his way to good deeds; but he was disposed to at peace in the earth — that is this world — and inclined to it and followed his whims by calling others to them and so We abased him. Therefore his likeness his description is as the likeness of a dog if you attack it by driving it away or curbing it it lolls its tongue out and if you leave it it lolls its tongue out and no other animal is like it in this way both conditional sentences constitute a circumstantial qualifier that is to say it has its tongue lolling out despicably in all circumstances. The purpose here is to point out the similarity between the one who follows his whims and a dog in terms of condition and vileness judging by the contextualising fā’ of fa-mathaluhu ‘therefore his likeness’ which relates what comes after it to what came before it in the way of ‘inclining towards this world and following whims’ and judging by God’s saying That likeness is the likeness of those people who deny Our signs. So recount the tale to the Jews that they might reflect upon it and so believe.
سَآءَ مَثَلاً ٱلْقَوْمُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَذَّبُواْ بِآيَاتِنَا وَأَنفُسَهُمْ كَانُواْ يَظْلِمُونَ,Evil as an example are the people evil is the example of the people who denied Our signs and were wont to wrong themselves through denial.
مَن يَهْدِ ٱللَّهُ فَهُوَ ٱلْمُهْتَدِي وَمَن يُضْلِلْ فَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْخَاسِرُونَ,He whom God guides he is guided and he whom He sends astray — truly they are the losers.
وَلَقَدْ ذَرَأْنَا لِجَهَنَّمَ كَثِيراً مِّنَ ٱلْجِنِّ وَٱلإِنْسِ لَهُمْ قُلُوبٌ لاَّ يَفْقَهُونَ بِهَا وَلَهُمْ أَعْيُنٌ لاَّ يُبْصِرُونَ بِهَا وَلَهُمْ آذَانٌ لاَّ يَسْمَعُونَ بِهَآ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ كَٱلأَنْعَامِ بَلْ هُمْ أَضَلُّ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْغَافِلُونَ,And We have indeed urged unto Hell many of the jinn and mankind having hearts wherewith they do not understand the truth and having eyes wherewith they do not perceive the proofs of God’s power with a perception that entails reflection and having ears wherewith they do not hear the signs or the admonitions in a way so as to reflect and take heed. These they are like cattle in their failure to understand perceive or listen — nay rather they are further astray than cattle because at least they cattle seek what is beneficial to them and stay away from what is harmful to them these individuals on the other hand are proceeding towards the Fire out of sheer obstinacy. These — they are the heedless.
وَللَّهِ ٱلأَسْمَآءُ ٱلْحُسْنَىٰ فَٱدْعُوهُ بِهَا وَذَرُواْ ٱلَّذِينَ يُلْحِدُونَ فِيۤ أَسْمَآئِهِ سَيُجْزَوْنَ مَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ,And to God belong the ninety nine Most Beautiful Names — mentioned in hadīth — al-husnā is the feminine for al-ahsan so invoke name Him by them and leave those who blaspheme His Names yulhidūn ‘they blaspheme’ from fourth form alhada or first form lahada meaning ‘those who incline away from the truth’ by deriving from them names for their gods as in the case of al-Lāt from Allāh ‘God’ al-‘Uzzā from al-‘Azīz ‘Mighty’ and Manāt from al-Mannān ‘Lord of Favours’. They will be requited in the Hereafter the requital for what they did — this was revealed before the command to fight them.
وَمِمَّنْ خَلَقْنَآ أُمَّةٌ يَهْدُونَ بِٱلْحَقِّ وَبِهِ يَعْدِلُونَ,And of those whom We created there is a community who guide by the truth and act justly therewith this is the community of Muhammad (s) as stated in a hadīth.
وَٱلَّذِينَ كَذَّبُواْ بِآيَٰتِنَا سَنَسْتَدْرِجُهُمْ مِّنْ حَيْثُ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ,And those who deny Our signs — the Qur’ān — from among the people of Mecca We will draw them on by degrees We will lead them on gradually whence they do not know.
وَأُمْلِي لَهُمْ إِنَّ كَيْدِي مَتِينٌ,And I will respite them — assuredly My scheme is strong powerful and cannot be withstood.
أَوَلَمْ يَتَفَكَّرُواْ مَا بِصَاحِبِهِمْ مِّن جِنَّةٍ إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ نَذِيرٌ مُّبِينٌ,Have they not considered and so realised that that there is no madness in their comrade Muhammad (s)? He is but a clear warner one whose warning is evident.
أَوَلَمْ يَنْظُرُواْ فِي مَلَكُوتِ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَمَا خَلَقَ ٱللَّهُ مِن شَيْءٍ وَأَنْ عَسَىۤ أَن يَكُونَ قَدِ ٱقْتَرَبَ أَجَلُهُمْ فَبِأَيِّ حَدِيثٍ بَعْدَهُ يُؤْمِنُونَ,And have they not reflected upon the dominion the kingdom malakūt is mulk of the heaven and of the earth and upon what things God has created min shay’in is an explication of the preceding mā ‘what’ so that they are able to infer the power of their Creator and His Oneness and upon that upon the fact that it may be that their term is already near so that they might hasten to believe lest they die as disbelievers and move towards the Fire? In what fact then after this that is the Qur’ān will they believe?
مَن يُضْلِلِ ٱللَّهُ فَلاَ هَادِيَ لَهُ وَيَذَرُهُمْ فِي طُغْيَانِهِمْ يَعْمَهُونَ,Whomever God sends astray he has no guide. And He leaves them read in the imperfect indicative wa-yadharuhum or wa-nadharuhum ‘and We leave them’ as the beginning of a new sentence; or the same verbs in the imperfect jussive apocopated form wa-yadharhum or wa-nadharhum as a supplement to what comes after fā’ of fa-lā hādiya lahu ‘so he has no guide’ in their insolence to wander on blindly hesitating out of perplexity.
يَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ ٱلسَّاعَةِ أَيَّانَ مُرْسَٰهَا قُلْ إِنَّمَا عِلْمُهَا عِنْدَ رَبِّي لاَ يُجَلِّيهَا لِوَقْتِهَآ إِلاَّ هُوَ ثَقُلَتْ فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ لاَ تَأْتِيكُمْ إِلاَّ بَغْتَةً يَسْأَلُونَكَ كَأَنَّكَ حَفِيٌّ عَنْهَا قُلْ إِنَّمَا عِلْمُهَا عِندَ ٱللَّهِ وَلَـٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ ٱلنَّاسِ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ,They that is the people of Mecca will question you about the Hour the Resurrection when it shall come to pass. Say to them ‘The knowledge of when it shall be is only with my Lord. He alone shall reveal it manifest it at its proper time li-waqtihā the lām here functions as fī ‘at’. It weighs heavily tremendously in the heavens and the earth upon their inhabitants because of its awesomeness. It will not come on you save all of a sudden’. They will question you as if you were preoccupied with obsessed with inquiring about it such that you have come to acquire knowledge of it. Say ‘Knowledge of it is only with God innamā ‘ilmuhā ‘inda’Llāhi is for emphasis but most people do not know’ that knowledge of it lies with God exalted be He.
قُل لاَّ أَمْلِكُ لِنَفْسِي نَفْعاً وَلاَ ضَرّاً إِلاَّ مَا شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ وَلَوْ كُنتُ أَعْلَمُ ٱلْغَيْبَ لاَسْتَكْثَرْتُ مِنَ ٱلْخَيْرِ وَمَا مَسَّنِيَ ٱلسُّوۤءُ إِنْ أَنَاْ إِلاَّ نَذِيرٌ وَبَشِيرٌ لِّقَوْمٍ يُؤْمِنُونَ,Say ‘I have no power to bring benefit to attract it to myself or hurt to repel it except as God wills. Had I knowledge of the Unseen — that which is hidden from me I would have acquired much good and adversity in the way of impoverishment and otherwise would not touch me since I would take precautions against such adversity by avoiding what is harmful. I am but a warner to disbelievers of the Fire and a bearer of good tidings of Paradise to a people who believe’.
هُوَ ٱلَّذِي خَلَقَكُمْ مِّن نَّفْسٍ وَاحِدَةٍ وَجَعَلَ مِنْهَا زَوْجَهَا لِيَسْكُنَ إِلَيْهَا فَلَماَّ تَغَشَّاهَا حَمَلَتْ حَمْلاً خَفِيفاً فَمَرَّتْ بِهِ فَلَمَّآ أَثْقَلَتْ دَّعَوَا ٱللَّهَ رَبَّهُمَا لَئِنْ آتَيْتَنَا صَالِحاً لَّنَكُونَنَّ مِنَ ٱلشَّاكِرِينَ,He that is God it is Who created you from a single soul namely Adam and made created from him his spouse Eve that he might take rest in her and become intimate with her. Then when he covered her when he had sexual intercourse with her she bore a light burden namely the sperm-drop and moved to and fro with it that is she came and went easily on account of its lightness; but when she became heavy because of the child growing inside her and they became anxious that it should be a dumb child they cried to God their Lord ‘If You give us one a child that is sound unimpaired we indeed shall be of the thankful’ to You for it.
فَلَمَّآ آتَاهُمَا صَالِحاً جَعَلاَ لَهُ شُرَكَآءَ فِيمَآ آتَاهُمَا فَتَعَالَى ٱللَّهُ عَمَّا يُشْرِكُونَ,But when He gave them a sound one a sound child they ascribed to Him associates shurakā’a a variant reading has shirkan meaning sharīkan ‘an associate’ in that which He had given them by naming it ‘Abd al-Hārith ‘servant of al-Hārith’ when it is not right to be a ‘servant’ ‘abd of any one but ‘God’ sc. ‘Abd Allāh but this namesake ‘Abd is not an association of another with God in terms of servitude for Adam was immune from a sin such as associating others in worship with God. Samura b. Jundub reported that the Prophet s said ‘On one occasion when Eve gave birth — all the children she bore had failed to survive — Satan visited her and said to her “Name it the child ‘Abd al-Hārith and it will live.” She named it so and it lived. This affair was the result of Satan’s inspiration and his doings’ reported by al-Hākim who deemed it the report ‘sound’ sahīh and also reported by al-Tirmidhī who considered it ‘fair-uncommon’ hasan gharīb; but exalted is God above what they the people of Mecca associate in the way of idols this sentence is consequent a supplement to the one beginning with khalaqakum ‘He created you’ so that what comes between the two is a parenthetical statement.
أَيُشْرِكُونَ مَا لاَ يَخْلُقُ شَيْئاً وَهُمْ يُخْلَقُونَ,Do they associate with Him in worship those who cannot create anything but are themselves created
وَلاَ يَسْتَطِيعُونَ لَهُمْ نَصْراً وَلآ أَنْفُسَهُمْ يَنصُرُونَ,and who are not able to give them that is those who worship them any help nor can they help themselves? by defending themselves against someone intending to damage them by breaking them or otherwise the interrogative is meant as a rebuke.
وَإِن تَدْعُوهُمْ إِلَى ٱلْهُدَىٰ لاَ يَتَّبِعُوكُمْ سَوَآءٌ عَلَيْكُمْ أَدَعَوْتُمُوهُمْ أَمْ أَنْتُمْ صَٰمِتُونَ,And if you call them that is the idols to guidance they will not follow you read yatba‘ūkum or yattabi‘ūkum. It will be the same response for you whether you call them to it or whether you are silent refraining from calling them they will not follow it because they cannot hear.
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ تَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ عِبَادٌ أَمْثَالُكُمْ فَٱدْعُوهُمْ فَلْيَسْتَجِيبُواْ لَكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ صَادِقِينَ,Truly those on whom you call whom you worship besides God are servants owned like you; call them then and let them answer you your call if you are truthful in claiming that they are gods God then illustrates their utter incapacity and the superiority which their worshippers possess over them saying
أَلَهُمْ أَرْجُلٌ يَمْشُونَ بِهَآ أَمْ لَهُمْ أَيْدٍ يَبْطِشُونَ بِهَآ أَمْ لَهُمْ أَعْيُنٌ يُبْصِرُونَ بِهَآ أَمْ لَهُمْ آذَانٌ يَسْمَعُونَ بِهَا قُلِ ٱدْعُواْ شُرَكَآءَكُمْ ثُمَّ كِيدُونِ فَلاَ تُنظِرُونِ,Have they feet wherewith they walk or indeed have they hands aydin is the plural of yad wherewith they can grasp or indeed have they eyes wherewith they can see or indeed have they ears wherewith they give ear? an interrogative of rejection in other words they have none of these things which you have so why do you worship them when you are more complete in being than they are? Say to them O Muhammad (s) ‘Call upon your associates to destroy me; then scheme against me and waste no time do not give me any respite for I am not concerned with you.
إِنَّ وَلِيِّـيَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِي نَزَّلَ ٱلْكِتَابَ وَهُوَ يَتَوَلَّى ٱلصَّالِحِينَ,Truly my Protector the One in charge of my affairs is God Who reveals the Book the Qur’ān and He takes charge of the righteous by protecting them.
وَٱلَّذِينَ تَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِهِ لاَ يَسْتَطِيعُونَ نَصْرَكُمْ وَلاۤ أَنْفُسَهُمْ يَنْصُرُونَ,And as for those on whom you call besides God they have no power to help you nor can they help themselves’ so why should I be concerned with them?
وَإِن تَدْعُوهُمْ إِلَى ٱلْهُدَىٰ لاَ يَسْمَعُواْ وَتَرَٰهُمْ يَنظُرُونَ إِلَيْكَ وَهُمْ لاَ يُبْصِرُونَ,And if you call upon them that is the idols to guidance they do not hear; and you see them that is the idols O Muhammad (s) staring at you looking toward you as a person looks but they do not perceive.
خُذِ ٱلْعَفْوَ وَأْمُرْ بِٱلْعُرْفِ وَأَعْرِضْ عَنِ ٱلْجَاهِلِينَ,Indulge people with forgiveness accepting what issues spontaneously from people’s manners of behaviour and do not scrutinise them and enjoin kindness decency and turn away from the ignorant and do not counter their stupidity with the like.
وَإِمَّا يَنزَغَنَّكَ مِنَ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنِ نَزْغٌ فَٱسْتَعِذْ بِٱللَّهِ إِنَّهُ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ,And if immā the letter nūn of the conditional particle in ‘if’ has been assimilated with the extra mā ‘any’ any insinuation from Satan should provoke you that is if anything should turn you away from that which you have been commanded to do then seek refuge in God fa’sta‘idh bi’Llāh is the response to the conditional clause with the response to the command being omitted and He will ward it off from you He is Hearing of what is said Seeing of what is done.
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱتَّقَواْ إِذَا مَسَّهُمْ طَائِفٌ مِّنَ ٱلشَّيْطَانِ تَذَكَّرُواْ فَإِذَا هُم مُّبْصِرُونَ,Truly the God-fearing when a visitation from Satan touches them befalls them tayfun a variant reading has tā’ifun that is when something of the sort overcomes them they remember God’s punishment and His reward and then see clearly distinguishing the truth from what is other than it and so they return to God.
وَإِخْوَانُهُمْ يَمُدُّونَهُمْ فِي ٱلْغَيِّ ثُمَّ لاَ يُقْصِرُونَ,And their brothers that is the brothers of devils from among the disbelievers they the devils lead them further into error and they do not stop short do not desist from it by seeing clearly in the way that those who are God-fearing come to see clearly.
وَإِذَا لَمْ تَأْتِهِمْ بِآيَةٍ قَالُواْ لَوْلاَ ٱجْتَبَيْتَهَا قُلْ إِنَّمَآ أَتَّبِعُ مَا يِوحَىٰ إِلَيَّ مِن رَّبِّي هَـٰذَا بَصَآئِرُ مِن رَّبِّكُمْ وَهُدًى وَرَحْمَةً لِّقَوْمٍ يُؤْمِنُونَ,And when you do not bring them that is the people of Mecca a sign from among those which they request they say ‘Why have you not chosen one?’ why have you not produced one all by yourself? Say to them ‘I follow only that which is revealed to me from my Lord and it is not for me to bring anything from myself; this Qur’ān is insight proofs from your Lord and a guidance and a mercy for a people who believe’.
وَإِذَا قُرِىءَ ٱلْقُرْآنُ فَٱسْتَمِعُواْ لَهُ وَأَنصِتُواْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُرْحَمُونَ,And when the Qur’ān is recited listen to it and pay heed refraining from speech so that you might find mercy this was revealed regarding the requirement of refraining from speech during the mosque sermon which here has been expressed by the recital of ‘the Qur’ān’ because it the sermon comprises it; others say that it was revealed regarding the requirement of silence and attention during the recitation of the Qur’ān in general.
وَٱذْكُر رَّبَّكَ فِي نَفْسِكَ تَضَرُّعاً وَخِيفَةً وَدُونَ ٱلْجَهْرِ مِنَ ٱلْقَوْلِ بِٱلْغُدُوِّ وَٱلآصَالِ وَلاَ تَكُنْ مِّنَ ٱلْغَافِلِينَ,And remember your Lord within yourself that is secretly humbly submissively and fearfully in awe of Him and louder than speaking in secret more quietly than speaking out loud that is a middle way between the two at morning and evening at the beginning of the day and at its end. And do not be among the heedless of God’s remembrance.
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ عِندَ رَبِّكَ لاَ يَسْتَكْبِرُونَ عَنْ عِبَادَتِهِ وَيُسَبِّحُونَهُ وَلَهُ يَسْجُدُونَ,Surely those who are with your Lord namely the angels are not too proud they do not disdain to worship Him; they glorify Him exalting Him as being transcendent above what does not befit Him and to Him they prostrate that is they devote their submission and worship exclusively to Him so be like them!
يَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ ٱلأَنْفَالِ قُلِ ٱلأَنفَالُ لِلَّهِ وَٱلرَّسُولِ فَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَأَصْلِحُواْ ذَاتَ بِيْنِكُمْ وَأَطِيعُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ إِن كُنتُم مُّؤْمِنِينَ,‘They question you O Muhammad (s) concerning the spoils of war — the booty — to whom do they belong? Say to them ‘The spoils of war belong to God Who places them where He will and the Messenger who divides them according to God’s command. The Prophet s divided these spoils between them equally as reported by al-Hākim in his al-Mustadrak. So fear God and set things right between you that is set right the reality of that state of affairs which is between you through mutual affection and the refraining from quarrelling; and obey God and His Messenger if you are truly believers’.
إِنَّمَا ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ ٱلَّذِينَ إِذَا ذُكِرَ ٱللَّهُ وَجِلَتْ قُلُوبُهُمْ وَإِذَا تُلِيَتْ عَلَيْهِمْ ءَايَٰتُهُ زَادَتْهُمْ إِيمَٰناً وَعَلَىٰ رَبِّهِمْ يَتَوَكَّلُونَ,The believers those whose faith is complete are only those who when God is mentioned that is when His threat of punishment is mentioned their hearts tremble fear and when His verses are recited to them they increase their faith their acceptance of the truth and who rely upon their Lord who put their trust in Him alone and not in any other.
ٱلَّذِينَ يُقِيمُونَ ٱلصَّلاَةَ وَمِمَّا رَزَقْنَاهُمْ يُنفِقُونَ,Those who observe the prayers performing them as they ought to be performed and who expend in obedience to God from that with which We have provided them.
أُوْلۤـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ حَقّاً لَّهُمْ دَرَجَاتٌ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ وَمَغْفِرَةٌ وَرِزْقٌ كَرِيمٌ,Those described in the way mentioned are the true the real believers without doubt. For them are ranks stations in Paradise with their Lord and forgiveness and generous provision in Paradise.
كَمَآ أَخْرَجَكَ رَبُّكَ مِن بَيْتِكَ بِٱلْحَقِّ وَإِنَّ فَرِيقاً مِّنَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ لَكَارِهُونَ,As your Lord brought you forth from your home with the truth bi’l-haqq is semantically connected to akhraja ‘He brought forth’ and indeed a party of the believers were averse to going forth the last sentence is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the suffixed pronoun kāf in akhrajaka ‘He brought you forth’; kamā ‘as’ is the predicate of an omitted subject in other words their aversion to this state of affairs of the booty being God’s and the Prophet’s is similar to their aversion when you were brought forth to fight which had actually been better for them likewise is this state of affairs better for them. It happened that Abū Sufyān was returning from Syria with a caravan. The Prophet s and his followers went forth to plunder it; but Quraysh became aware of this and so Abū Jahl and some Meccan fighters rode out to defend it — these constituted the ‘band’. Abū Sufyān drove the caravan via the coastal route and it managed to escape. Abū Jahl was then advised to return but he refused and marched on towards Badr. The Prophet s consulted with his followers saying to them ‘God has promised me one of the two parties’. So they agreed with him to attack the Meccan band but some of them were averse to this complaining ‘We have not come prepared for this!’ as God exalted be He says
يُجَادِلُونَكَ فِي ٱلْحَقِّ بَعْدَ مَا تَبَيَّنَ كَأَنَّمَا يُسَاقُونَ إِلَى ٱلْمَوْتِ وَهُمْ يَنظُرُونَ,They dispute with you concerning the truth the order to fight after it had become clear after it had become evident to them as though they were being driven to death while they looked at it death with their very eyes utterly averse to it.
وَإِذْ يَعِدُكُمُ ٱللَّهُ إِحْدَى ٱلطَّآئِفَتِيْنِ أَنَّهَا لَكُمْ وَتَوَدُّونَ أَنَّ غَيْرَ ذَاتِ ٱلشَّوْكَةِ تَكُونُ لَكُمْ وَيُرِيدُ ٱللَّهُ أَن يُحِقَّ الحَقَّ بِكَلِمَاتِهِ وَيَقْطَعَ دَابِرَ ٱلْكَافِرِينَ,And remember when God promised you one of the two parties either the caravan or the band of Meccan fighters that it should be yours and you longed you were wishing that other than the armed one that is other than the fighting one with the weapons in other words you longed that the caravan should be yours because it had fewer men and less reinforcements than the band of Mecca fighters; but God willed that the truth be realised He willed to manifest it by His preceding words that Islam should triumph; and to cut the root of the disbelievers to the very last man by extirpating them and so He commanded you to fight against the band.
لِيُحِقَّ ٱلْحَقَّ وَيُبْطِلَ ٱلْبَاطِلَ وَلَوْ كَرِهَ ٱلْمُجْرِمُونَ,And that He might cause the truth to be realised and annul efface falsehood disbelief however much the sinners the idolaters were averse to that.
إِذْ تَسْتَغِيثُونَ رَبَّكُمْ فَٱسْتَجَابَ لَكُمْ أَنِّي مُمِدُّكُمْ بِأَلْفٍ مِّنَ ٱلْمَلاۤئِكَةِ مُرْدِفِينَ,When you sought help from your Lord asking Him to help you by granting you victory over them and He answered you saying ‘I shall reinforce you I shall assist you with a thousand angels rank upon rank’ one rank following after the next God promised them this number at first but it then became three thousand and then five thousand as stated in sūrat Āl ‘Imrān Q. 3124-125 a variant reading of alf ‘thousand’ has the plural āluf ‘thousands’ similar in pattern to aflus ‘coins’.
وَمَا جَعَلَهُ ٱللَّهُ إِلاَّ بُشْرَىٰ وَلِتَطْمَئِنَّ بِهِ قُلُوبُكُمْ وَمَا ٱلنَّصْرُ إِلاَّ مِنْ عِندِ ٱللَّهِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ,And God appointed it that is the reinforcement only as good tidings and that your hearts might thereby be reassured. Victory comes only from God surely God is Mighty Wise.
إِذْ يُغَشِّيكُمُ ٱلنُّعَاسَ أَمَنَةً مِّنْهُ وَيُنَزِّلُ عَلَيْكُم مِّن ٱلسَّمَآءِ مَآءً لِّيُطَهِّرَكُمْ بِهِ وَيُذْهِبَ عَنكُمْ رِجْزَ ٱلشَّيْطَانِ وَلِيَرْبِطَ عَلَىٰ قُلُوبِكُمْ وَيُثَبِّتَ بِهِ ٱلأَقْدَامَ,Remember when He caused slumber to overcome you as security against the fear that had befallen you from Him from God and sent down upon you water from the heaven to purify you thereby from minor and major ritual impurities; and to remove from you the evil of Satan his whisperings to you that had you been on the right path you would not have been thirsty and impure while the idolaters enjoyed access to water; and to strengthen to seal your hearts with certainty and endurance; and to make firm your feet lest they sink in the sand.
إِذْ يُوحِي رَبُّكَ إِلَى ٱلْمَلاۤئِكَةِ أَنِّي مَعَكُمْ فَثَبِّتُواْ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ سَأُلْقِي فِي قُلُوبِ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ ٱلرُّعْبَ فَٱضْرِبُواْ فَوْقَ ٱلأَعْنَاقِ وَٱضْرِبُواْ مِنْهُمْ كُلَّ بَنَانٍ,When your Lord inspired the angels with whom He reinforced the Muslims saying ‘I am with you with assistance and victorious help so make the believers stand firm by helping them and giving them good tidings. I shall cast terror fear into the hearts of the disbelievers; so smite above the necks that is the heads and smite of them every finger!’ that is smite the extremities of their hands and feet thus when one of them went to strike an disbeliever’s head it would roll off before his sword reached it. The Prophet s threw a handful of pebbles against them and every single idolater was struck in his eye and thus they were defeated.
ذٰلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ شَآقُّواْ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ وَمَن يُشَاقِقِ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ شَدِيدُ ٱلْعِقَابِ,That chastisement befalling them is because they had contended with they had opposed God and His Messenger whoever contends with God and with His Messenger surely God is severe in retribution against him.
ذٰلِكُمْ فَذُوقُوهُ وَأَنَّ لِلْكَافِرِينَ عَذَابَ ٱلنَّارِ,That chastisement is for you so taste it O disbelievers in this world; and know that for the disbelievers in the Hereafter is the chastisement of the Fire.
يَٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُوۤاْ إِذَا لَقِيتُمُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ زَحْفاً فَلاَ تُوَلُّوهُمُ ٱلأَدْبَارَ,O you who believe when you encounter the disbelievers inching forward that is amassed advancing slowly because of their large numbers do not turn your backs to them fleeing.
وَمَن يُوَلِّهِمْ يَوْمَئِذٍ دُبُرَهُ إِلاَّ مُتَحَرِّفاً لِّقِتَالٍ أَوْ مُتَحَيِّزاً إِلَىٰ فِئَةٍ فَقَدْ بَآءَ بِغَضَبٍ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَمَأْوَاهُ جَهَنَّمُ وَبِئْسَ ٱلْمَصِيرُ,Whoever turns his back to them on that day the day of the encounter with them unless manœuvring turning around for battle — by pretending to be in flight as a trick while actually intending to relaunch an attack — or joining another detachment a company of Muslims calling on it for assistance he has truly incurred the wrath of God and his abode will be Hell — an evil journey’s end! an evil return it is. This threat applies so long as the numbers of disbelievers do not surpass twice that of the believers.
فَلَمْ تَقْتُلُوهُمْ وَلَـٰكِنَّ ٱللَّهَ قَتَلَهُمْ وَمَا رَمَيْتَ إِذْ رَمَيْتَ وَلَـٰكِنَّ ٱللَّهَ رَمَىٰ وَلِيُبْلِيَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ مِنْهُ بَلاۤءً حَسَناً إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ,You did not slay them at Badr by your own might but God slew them by giving you assistance and you threw not O Muhammad (s) against the eyes of the unbelieving folk when you threw the pebbles for a handful of pebbles thrown by a human being cannot strike the eyes of every person in a large troop but God threw by making that throw reach them. He did this in order to vanquish the disbelievers and that He might try the believers with a fair test a fair gift namely booty; surely God is Hearing of their sayings Knowing of their conditions.
ذٰلِكُمْ وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ مُوهِنُ كَيْدِ ٱلْكَافِرِينَ,That is the true gift for you and know that God weakens the plan of the disbelievers.
إِن تَسْتَفْتِحُواْ فَقَدْ جَآءَكُمُ ٱلْفَتْحُ وَإِن تَنتَهُواْ فَهُوَ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ وَإِن تَعُودُواْ نَعُدْ وَلَن تُغْنِيَ عَنْكُمْ فِئَتُكُمْ شَيْئاً وَلَوْ كَثُرَتْ وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ مَعَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,If you have sought a judgement O disbelievers if you have sought a decisive conclusion of this battle — Abū Jahl had said ‘O God! Whoever among the two of us is the one who has severed the ties of kinship and brought us what we had never known destroy them today!’ — the judgement the decisive conclusion has now come to you by the fact that the one so described has already perished this was Abū Jahl and those killed with him and not the Prophet s and the believers; and if you desist from unbelief and waging war it will better for you. But if you return to fight against the Prophet s We shall return to assist him against you and your host your troops will not avail will not protect you in any way however numerous it be; and verily God is with the believers read thus inna indicating a new sentence; or read anna with an implicit lām li-anna‘Llāha ma‘a’l-mu’minīn ‘because God is with the believers’.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُوۤاْ أَطِيعُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ وَلاَ تَوَلَّوْا عَنْهُ وَأَنْتُمْ تَسْمَعُونَ,O you who believe obey God and His Messenger and do not turn away from Him by contravening His command while you are listening to the Qur’ān and the admonitions.
وَلاَ تَكُونُواْ كَالَّذِينَ قَالُوا سَمِعْنَا وَهُمْ لاَ يَسْمَعُونَ,And do not be as those who say ‘We hear’ and they hear not in such a way as to reflect and heed admonition — these are either the hypocrites or the idolaters.
إِنَّ شَرَّ ٱلدَّوَابِّ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ ٱلصُّمُّ ٱلْبُكْمُ ٱلَّذِينَ لاَ يَعْقِلُونَ,Surely the worst of beasts in God’s sight are those who are deaf to hearing the truth and dumb unable to utter it those who do not understand.
وَلَوْ عَلِمَ ٱللَّهُ فِيهِمْ خَيْراً لأَسْمَعَهُمْ وَلَوْ أَسْمَعَهُمْ لَتَوَلَّواْ وَّهُمْ مُّعْرِضُونَ,For had God known of any good in them any righteousness were they to listen to the truth He would have made them hear in such a way as to understand; and had He made them hear — hypothetically speaking — already knowing that there is no good in them they would have turned away from it averse to accepting it out of obstinacy and in denial.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ ٱسْتَجِيبُواْ لِلَّهِ وَلِلرَّسُولِ إِذَا دَعَاكُم لِمَا يُحْيِيكُمْ وَاعْلَمُواْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَحُولُ بَيْنَ ٱلْمَرْءِ وَقَلْبِهِ وَأَنَّهُ إِلَيْهِ تُحْشَرُونَ,O you who believe respond to God and the Messenger with obedience when He calls you to that which will give you life in the matter of religion for it will be the source of everlasting life for you; and know that God comes in between a man and his heart so that he cannot believe or disbelieve except by His will; and that it is to Him that you shall be gathered and He will requite you for your deeds.
وَٱتَّقُواْ فِتْنَةً لاَّ تُصِيبَنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ مِنكُمْ خَآصَّةً وَٱعْلَمُوۤاْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ شَدِيدُ ٱلْعِقَابِ,And be afraid of a trial which if it were to fall upon you would certainly not fall exclusively upon the evildoers among you but would encompass them and others and the way to guard against it is to repudiate that evil which necessarily results in precipitating it; and know that God is severe in retribution against those who oppose Him.
وَٱذْكُرُوۤاْ إِذْ أَنتُمْ قَلِيلٌ مُّسْتَضْعَفُونَ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ تَخَافُونَ أَن يَتَخَطَّفَكُمُ ٱلنَّاسُ فَآوَاكُمْ وَأَيَّدَكُم بِنَصْرِهِ وَرَزَقَكُمْ مِّنَ ٱلطَّيِّبَاتِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ,And remember when you were few and oppressed in the land the land of Mecca and were fearful lest men should snatch you away lest the disbelievers should seize you swiftly; how He gave you refuge in Medina and reinforced you strengthened you with His help on the day of Badr with the angels and provided you with the good things the spoils that you might be thankful for His graces.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ لاَ تَخُونُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَٱلرَّسُولَ وَتَخُونُوۤاْ أَمَانَاتِكُمْ وَأَنْتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ,The following was revealed regarding Abū Lubāba Marwān b. ‘Abd al-Mundhir the Prophet s had dispatched him to the Banū Qurayza so that they would submit to his the Prophet’s authority. But they Banū Qurayza consulted with him as to whether they should cede and he pointed out to them that a slaughter would ensue — for members of his family and his property were among them O you who believe do not betray God and the Messenger and do not betray your trusts that which has been entrusted to you in the way of religion or otherwise while you are aware.
وَٱعْلَمُوۤاْ أَنَّمَآ أَمْوَالُكُمْ وَأَوْلاَدُكُمْ فِتْنَةٌ وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ عِندَهُ أَجْرٌ عَظِيمٌ,And know that your wealth and your children are a trial for you impeding you from the concerns of the Hereafter; and that with God is a tremendous wage so do not forfeit it by giving undue attention to wealth and children acting treacherously for the sake of preserving them.
يِٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوۤاْ إِن تَتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّكُمْ فُرْقَاناً وَيُكَفِّرْ عَنكُمْ سَيِّئَاتِكُمْ وَيَغْفِرْ لَكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ ذُو ٱلْفَضْلِ ٱلْعَظِيمِ,The following was revealed regarding his Abū Lubāba’s repentance O you who believe if you fear God by turning in repentance to Him and in other ways He will grant you a means of separation between yourselves and what you fear so that you will be delivered and absolve you of your evil deeds and forgive you your sins; and God is of tremendous bounty.
وَإِذْ يَمْكُرُ بِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لِيُثْبِتُوكَ أَوْ يَقْتُلُوكَ أَوْ يُخْرِجُوكَ وَيَمْكُرُونَ وَيَمْكُرُ ٱللَّهُ وَٱللَّهُ خَيْرُ ٱلْمَاكِرِينَ,And remember O Muhammad (s) when the disbelievers — who had gathered to discuss your affair at the council assembly — were plotting against you to confine you to chain you up and imprison you or slay you — all of them acting as assassins of one man — or to expel you from Mecca and they were plotting against you and God was plotting against them by devising a way out for you when He revealed to you what they had devised and commanded you to leave Mecca; and God is the best of those who plot the most knowledgeable among them about it.
وَإِذَا تُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْهِمْ آيَاتُنَا قَالُواْ قَدْ سَمِعْنَا لَوْ نَشَآءُ لَقُلْنَا مِثْلَ هَـٰذَا إِنْ هَـٰذَآ إِلاَّ أَسَاطِيرُ ٱلأَوَّلِينَ,And when Our verses namely the Qur’ān were being recited to them they said ‘We have already heard! If we wish we can speak the like of this — al-Nadr b. al-Hārith said this for he used to travel on trading business to al-Hīra where he would buy books containing the tales of the Persians and would recount these to the Meccans; this Qur’ān is nothing but the fables the lies of the ancients’.
وَإِذْ قَالُواْ ٱللَّهُمَّ إِن كَانَ هَـٰذَا هُوَ ٱلْحَقَّ مِنْ عِندِكَ فَأَمْطِرْ عَلَيْنَا حِجَارَةً مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ أَوِ ٱئْتِنَا بِعَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ,And when they said ‘O God! If this that Muhammad (s) recites be indeed the truth revealed from You then rain down stones upon us from the heaven or bring on us a painful chastisement’ in return for our denial of it this was said by al-Nadr and others in mockery and in delusion that he had some insight and certainty about it the Qur’ān being false.
وَمَا كَانَ ٱللَّهُ لِيُعَذِّبَهُمْ وَأَنتَ فِيهِمْ وَمَا كَانَ ٱللَّهُ مُعَذِّبَهُمْ وَهُمْ يَسْتَغْفِرُونَ,God then says But God was not about to chastise them for what they requested while you were among them for when chastisement is sent down it is all-encompassing and no community was ever chastised except after its prophet and the believers had departed from it; nor was God about to chastise them while they sought forgiveness crying as they performed the circumambulations ‘Your forgiveness! Your forgiveness!’; it is also said that this last clause refers to those oppressed believers among them similar to where God says Had they been clearly separated verily We would have chastised the disbelievers among them with a painful chastisement Q. 4825.
وَمَا لَهُمْ أَلاَّ يُعَذِّبَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ وَهُمْ يَصُدُّونَ عَنِ ٱلْمَسْجِدِ ٱلْحَرَامِ وَمَا كَانُوۤاْ أَوْلِيَآءَهُ إِنْ أَوْلِيَآؤُهُ إِلاَّ ٱلْمُتَّقُونَ وَلَـٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَهُمْ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ,But what plea have they now that God should not chastise them with the sword after your departure and that of the oppressed believers — if this verse is understood in accordance with the first opinion that it refers to the idolaters asking forgiveness then it abrogates the previous one for God had chastised them at Badr and in other instances — when they bar prevent the Prophet s and the Muslims from the Sacred Mosque from performing circumambulations there though they are not its guardians? as they claim? Its only rightful guardians are the God-fearing but most of them do not know that they have no rightful custodianship over it.
وَمَا كَانَ صَلاَتُهُمْ عِندَ ٱلْبَيْتِ إِلاَّ مُكَآءً وَتَصْدِيَةً فَذُوقُواْ ٱلْعَذَابَ بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَكْفُرُونَ,And their prayer at the Sacred House is nothing but whistling and hand-clapping in other words they do this in place of the prayer which they were ordered to perform — therefore taste now at Badr the chastisement for your unbelief!
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ يُنفِقُونَ أَمْوَالَهُمْ لِيَصُدُّواْ عَن سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ فَسَيُنفِقُونَهَا ثُمَّ تَكُونُ عَلَيْهِمْ حَسْرَةً ثُمَّ يُغْلَبُونَ وَٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوۤاْ إِلَىٰ جَهَنَّمَ يُحْشَرُونَ,The disbelievers expend their wealth in waging war against the Prophet s in order to bar from God’s way and they will expend it until in the end it will be a source of anguish for them a regret for having lost it and lost what they had intended by expending it; then they will be defeated in this world and the disbelievers among them will be gathered driven into Hell in the Hereafter
لِيَمِيزَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْخَبِيثَ مِنَ ٱلطَّيِّبِ وَيَجْعَلَ ٱلْخَبِيثَ بَعْضَهُ عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ فَيَرْكُمَهُ جَمِيعاً فَيَجْعَلَهُ فِي جَهَنَّمَ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْخَاسِرُونَ,that God may distinguish read li-yamīza or li-yumayyiza is semantically connected to takūnu ‘it will be’ from the previous verse the wicked the disbeliever from the good the believer and place the wicked one upon another and heap them up all together and put them in Hell those they are the losers.
قُل لِلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوۤاْ إِن يَنتَهُواْ يُغَفَرْ لَهُمْ مَّا قَدْ سَلَفَ وَإِنْ يَعُودُواْ فَقَدْ مَضَتْ سُنَّتُ الأَوَّلِينَ,Say to the disbelievers such as Abū Sufyān and his companions that if they desist from unbelief and from waging war against the Prophet s that which is past of their deeds will be forgiven them; but if they return to waging war against him the way of dealing with the ancients has already gone before! that is Our way in dealing with them by destroying them We will do the same with these ones.
وَقَاتِلُوهُمْ حَتَّىٰ لاَ تَكُونَ فِتْنَةٌ وَيَكُونَ الدِّينُ كُلُّهُ لله فَإِنِ انْتَهَوْاْ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ بِمَا يَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ,And fight them until sedition idolatry is exists no more and religion is all for God alone none other being worshipped; then if they desist from unbelief surely God sees what they do and will requite them for it.
وَإِن تَوَلَّوْاْ فَٱعْلَمُوۤاْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ مَوْلاَكُمْ نِعْمَ ٱلْمَوْلَىٰ وَنِعْمَ ٱلنَّصِيرُ,But if they turn away from belief know that God is your Protector your Helper and the One Who takes charge of your affairs — an excellent Protector is He and an excellent Helper! He is for you.
وَٱعْلَمُوۤا أَنَّمَا غَنِمْتُمْ مِّن شَيْءٍ فَأَنَّ لِلَّهِ خُمُسَهُ وَلِلرَّسُولِ وَلِذِي ٱلْقُرْبَىٰ وَٱلْيَتَامَىٰ وَٱلْمَسَاكِينِ وَٱبْنِ ٱلسَّبِيلِ إِن كُنتُمْ آمَنْتُمْ بِٱللَّهِ وَمَآ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَىٰ عَبْدِنَا يَوْمَ ٱلْفُرْقَانِ يَوْمَ ٱلْتَقَى ٱلْجَمْعَانِ وَٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,And know that whatever spoils you have taken you have seized from the disbelievers by force the fifth of it is for God to have it dispensed as He will and for the Messenger and for the kinsmen the kinsmen of the Prophet s from among the Banū Hāshim and the Banū ‘Abd al-Muttalib and the orphans children of Muslims those whose fathers have passed away and are in poverty and the needy those Muslims in dire need and the traveller those Muslims cut off during travel — in other words it the fifth is due to the Prophet s and those of these four categories in the way that he used to apportion it a fifth of the fifth for each one and the remaining four fifths for those who had captured the spoils if you believe in God then be aware of that and that which wa-mā is a supplement to bi’Llāhi ‘in God’ We sent down upon Our servant Muhammad (s) in the way of angels and signs on the Day of Discrimination that is the day of the battle of Badr which discriminated between truth and falsehood the day the two armies the Muslims and the believers met. And God has power over all things including giving you victory despite your being few and their being greater in number.
إِذْ أَنتُمْ بِالْعُدْوَةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَهُم بِٱلْعُدْوَةِ ٱلْقُصْوَىٰ وَٱلرَّكْبُ أَسْفَلَ مِنكُمْ وَلَوْ تَوَاعَدتُّمْ لاَخْتَلَفْتُمْ فِي ٱلْمِيعَادِ وَلَـٰكِن لِّيَقْضِيَ ٱللَّهُ أَمْراً كَانَ مَفْعُولاً لِّيَهْلِكَ مَنْ هَلَكَ عَن بَيِّنَةٍ وَيَحْيَىٰ مَنْ حَيَّ عَن بَيِّنَةٍ وَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَسَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ,When idh substitutes for yawma ‘the day’ you were on the nearer bank the one nearer to Medina read ‘udwa or ‘idwa meaning ‘the side of a valley’ and they were on the yonder bank the one further from it and the cavalcade the caravan was in a place below you the coastal side; and had you and the enemy band agreed to meet for battle you would have surely failed to keep meeting; but He brought you together at a different time that God might conclude a matter that was to be done through His knowledge — namely the victory of Islam and the obliteration of unbelief — He did this so that he who perished might perish might be a disbeliever even after a clear proof that is after a manifest proof has been established against him namely the triumph of the believers despite their small number over the larger enemy army; and that he who survived might live might believe after a clear proof; surely God is Hearing Knowing.
إِذْ يُرِيكَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ فِي مَنَامِكَ قَلِيلاً وَلَوْ أَرَاكَهُمْ كَثِيراً لَّفَشِلْتُمْ وَلَتَنَازَعْتُمْ فِي ٱلأَمْرِ وَلَـٰكِنَّ ٱللَّهَ سَلَّمَ إِنَّهُ عَلِيمٌ بِذَاتِ ٱلصُّدُورِ,Remember when God showed them to you in your dream in your sleep as few and so you informed your companions of this and they were delighted and had He shown them to you as many you would have faltered shrunk in cowardice and quarrelled fallen into disagreement over the matter the matter of fighting; but God saved you from faltering and quarrelling. He knows that which is in the breasts that which is in the hearts.
وَإِذْ يُرِيكُمُوهُمْ إِذِ ٱلْتَقَيْتُمْ فِيۤ أَعْيُنِكُمْ قَلِيلاً وَيُقَلِّلُكُمْ فِيۤ أَعْيُنِهِمْ لِيَقْضِيَ ٱللَّهُ أَمْراً كَانَ مَفْعُولاً وَإِلَى ٱللَّهِ تُرْجَعُ ٱلأُمُورُ,And when God made you see them O believers when you met — in your eyes as few as 70 or 100 when they were in fact 1000 so that you would advance against them; and He made you seem as few in their eyes so that they would advance and not turn back from fighting you — this was before close combat had begun but when it began He made them the disbelievers see these believers as twice their number as stated in sūrat Āl ‘Imrān Q. 313 — so that God might conclude a matter that was to be done; and to God all things are returned reverting.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُوۤاْ إِذَا لَقِيتُمْ فِئَةً فَٱثْبُتُواْ وَٱذْكُرُواْ ٱللَّهَ كَثِيراً لَّعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلَحُونَ,O you who believe when you meet a host a group of disbelievers then stand firm to fight them and do not flee in retreat and remember God much call upon Him for victory that you may succeed that you may triumph.
وَأَطِيعُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ وَلاَ تَنَازَعُواْ فَتَفْشَلُواْ وَتَذْهَبَ رِيحُكُمْ وَٱصْبِرُوۤاْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ مَعَ ٱلصَّابِرِينَ,And obey God and His Messenger and do not quarrel with one another do not fall into dispute with one another lest you falter become cowardly and your strength your power and dominion fade; and be patient. Surely God is with the patient giving them victory and assistance.
وَلاَ تَكُونُواْ كَٱلَّذِينَ خَرَجُواْ مِن دِيَارِهِم بَطَراً وَرِئَآءَ ٱلنَّاسِ وَيَصُدُّونَ عَن سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ وَٱللَّهُ بِمَا يَعْمَلُونَ مُحِيطٌ,And do not be like those who went forth from their dwellings to defend their caravan and but did not return after it had passed safely in recklessness and to show off to men — when they said ‘We will not return until we have drunk wine sacrificed the camels and have been entertained by singers at Badr and until people have heard about this — barring people from the way of God while God encompasses in knowledge what they do ya‘malūna also read ta‘malūna ‘you do’ and will requite them for it.
وَإِذْ زَيَّنَ لَهُمُ ٱلشَّيْطَانُ أَعْمَالَهُمْ وَقَالَ لاَ غَالِبَ لَكُمُ ٱلْيَوْمَ مِنَ ٱلنَّاسِ وَإِنِّي جَارٌ لَّكُمْ فَلَمَّا تَرَآءَتِ ٱلْفِئَتَانِ نَكَصَ عَلَىٰ عَقِبَيْهِ وَقَالَ إِنِّي بَرِيۤءٌ مِّنْكُمْ إِنَّيۤ أَرَىٰ مَا لاَ تَرَوْنَ إِنَّيۤ أَخَافُ ٱللَّهَ وَٱللَّهُ شَدِيدُ ٱلْعِقَابِ,And mention that Satan Iblīs adorned their deeds for them by encouraging them to go to meet the Muslims when they had feared to set out on account of their enemy the Banū Bakr and said to them ‘Today no person shall overcome you for I shall be your protector’ from among the Banū Kināna — he appeared to them in the form of Surāqa b. Mālik the chieftain of that region. But when the two armies the Muslims and the disbelievers sighted each other when they met and he Satan saw the angels his hand clasping that of al-Hārith b. Hishām he turned his back he withdrew in flight saying — when they had said to him ‘Are you abandoning us in such a predicament?’ ‘I am quit of you of being your protector for I see what you do not see in the way of angels. I fear God lest He destroy me; and God is severe in retribution’.
إِذْ يَقُولُ ٱلْمُنَافِقُونَ وَٱلَّذِينَ فِي قُلُوبِهِم مَّرَضٌ غَرَّ هَـٰؤُلاۤءِ دِينُهُمْ وَمَن يَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ,When the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is a sickness a weakness of faith said ‘Their religion has deluded them’ that is the Muslims for they had set out to fight a large army despite their small number in the mistaken belief that they will be victorious because of this. God exalted be He says in response to them but whoever relies on God whoever puts his trust in Him he will triumph; for truly God is Mighty His way will prevail Wise in His actions.
وَلَوْ تَرَىٰ إِذْ يَتَوَفَّى ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ ٱلْمَلاۤئِكَةُ يَضْرِبُونَ وُجُوهَهُمْ وَأَدْبَارَهُمْ وَذُوقُواْ عَذَابَ ٱلْحَرِيقِ,And if you could only see O Muhammad (s) when the angels take read either as yatawaffā or tatawaffā the disbelievers beating yadribūna is a circumstantial qualifier their faces and their backs with hooked iron rods and they say to them ‘Taste the chastisement of burning that is the Fire the response to the clause beginning with law ‘if’ would be la-ra’ayta amran ‘azīman ‘you would truly have seen an terrible sight’.
ذٰلِكَ بِمَا قَدَّمَتْ أَيْدِيكُمْ وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَيْسَ بِظَلَّٰمٍ لِّلْعَبِيدِ,That chastisement is for what your hands have sent before you — He refers to this their actions exclusively with these hands because most actions are accomplished with them — and know that God is never unjust to His servants’ such that he would punish them for no sin.
كَدَأْبِ آلِ فِرْعَوْنَ وَٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ كَفَرُواْ بِآيَاتِ ٱللَّهِ فَأَخَذَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ بِذُنُوبِهِمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ قَوِيٌّ شَدِيدُ ٱلْعِقَابِ,The way of these people is like the way of Pharaoh’s folk and those before them they disbelieved in God’s signs and so God seized them with chastisement because of their sins the sentence beginning with kafarū ‘they disbelieved’ explains the previous one. Truly God is strong in what He wills severe in retribution.
ذٰلِكَ بِأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَمْ يَكُ مُغَيِّراً نِّعْمَةً أَنْعَمَهَا عَلَىٰ قَوْمٍ حَتَّىٰ يُغَيِّرُواْ مَا بِأَنْفُسِهِمْ وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ,That chastisement of the disbelievers is because God would never change a grace that He had conferred on a people substituting it with affliction until they have changed that which is in themselves until they have exchanged the grace conferred upon them for unbelief in the way that the Meccan disbelievers exchanged their being ‘fed against hunger’ their being made ‘safe from fear’ cf. Q. 1064 and the sending of the Prophet s to them for unbelief for barring against the way of God and for fighting Muslims; and know that God is Hearing Knowing.
كَدَأْبِ آلِ فِرْعَوْنَ وَٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ كَذَّبُواْ بآيَاتِ رَبِّهِمْ فَأَهْلَكْنَاهُمْ بِذُنُوبِهِمْ وَأَغْرَقْنَآ آلَ فِرْعَونَ وَكُلٌّ كَانُواْ ظَالِمِينَ,Like the way of Pharaoh’s folk and those before them they denied the signs of their Lord so We destroyed them for their sins and We drowned the folk of Pharaoh his people together with him and all disbelieving communities were evildoers.
إِنَّ شَرَّ ٱلدَّوَابِّ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ فَهُمْ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ,The following was revealed regarding Banū Qurayza Surely the worst of beasts in God’s sight are the ungrateful who will not believe
ٱلَّذِينَ عَاهَدْتَّ مِنْهُمْ ثُمَّ يَنقُضُونَ عَهْدَهُمْ فِي كُلِّ مَرَّةٍ وَهُمْ لاَ يَتَّقُونَ,those of them with whom you have made a pact not to support the idolaters and then break their pact every time they conclude one and they are not fearful of God in their treachery.
فَإِمَّا تَثْقَفَنَّهُمْ فِي ٱلْحَرْبِ فَشَرِّدْ بِهِم مَّنْ خَلْفَهُمْ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَذَّكَّرُونَ,So if fa-immā here the letter nūn of the conditional particle in ‘if’ has been assimilated with the extra mā you come upon them if you find them anywhere in the war deal with them so as to cause those fighters behind them to scatter to disperse by making an example of them and punishing them so that they the ones behind them might remember that they might take heed from their example.
وَإِمَّا تَخَافَنَّ مِن قَوْمٍ خِيَانَةً فَٱنْبِذْ إِلَيْهِمْ عَلَىٰ سَوَآءٍ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لاَ يُحِبُّ ٱلخَائِنِينَ,And if you fear from any folk who have concluded a pact with you some treachery in a pact through some indication that comes to you then cast it back to them dissolve their pact with fairness ‘alā sawā’ is a circumstantial qualifier that is to say while you and they have equal knowledge that the pact has been broken by your apprising them thereof lest they accuse you of treachery. Truly God does not love the treacherous.
وَلاَ يَحْسَبَنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ سَبَقُوۤاْ إِنَّهُمْ لاَ يُعْجِزُونَ,The following was revealed regarding those who escaped capture on the day of Badr And do not O Muhammad (s) let those who disbelieve suppose that they have outstripped God that is that they have eluded Him indeed they cannot escape they cannot elude Him a variant reading has wa-lā yahsabanna ‘and do not let them suppose’ so that the first direct object is omitted actually being an implied anfusahum ‘themselves’ sc. ‘and do not let them suppose themselves to have outstripped’; and according to another variant reading anna is read instead of inna with an implicit lām sc. ‘because they cannot escape’.
وَأَعِدُّواْ لَهُمْ مَّا ٱسْتَطَعْتُمْ مِّن قُوَّةٍ وَمِن رِّبَاطِ ٱلْخَيْلِ تُرْهِبُونَ بِهِ عَدْوَّ ٱللَّهِ وَعَدُوَّكُمْ وَآخَرِينَ مِن دُونِهِمْ لاَ تَعْلَمُونَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ يَعْلَمُهُمْ وَمَا تُنفِقُواْ مِن شَيْءٍ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ يُوَفَّ إِلَيْكُمْ وَأَنْتُمْ لاَ تُظْلَمُونَ,Make ready for them for fighting them whatever force you can the Prophet s said that this refers to ‘archers’ as reported by Muslim and of horses tethered ribāt is a verbal noun meaning ‘restraining them for use in the way of God’ that thereby you may dismay terrify the enemy of God and your enemy namely the disbelievers of Mecca and others besides them that is other than those — namely the hypocrites or the Jews whom you know not God knows them. And whatever thing you expend in the way of God its requital shall be repaid to you in full and you will not be wronged you will not be diminished anything thereof.
وَإِن جَنَحُواْ لِلسَّلْمِ فَٱجْنَحْ لَهَا وَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ إِنَّهُ هُوَ ٱلسَّمِيعُ ٱلْعَلِيمُ,And if they incline to peace read silm or salm meaning ‘settlement’ then incline to it and conclude a pact with them Ibn ‘Abbās said ‘This has been abrogated by the “sword verse” Q. 95’; Mujāhid said ‘This stipulation applies exclusively in the context of the People of the Scripture for it was revealed regarding the Banū Qurayza; and rely on God put your trust in Him; truly He is the Hearer of words the Knower of actions.
وَإِن يُرِيدُوۤاْ أَن يَخْدَعُوكَ فَإِنَّ حَسْبَكَ ٱللَّهُ هُوَ ٱلَّذِيۤ أَيَّدَكَ بِنَصْرِهِ وَبِٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,And if they desire to trick you by making a peace settlement in order to make preparations for war against you then God is sufficient for you. He it is Who strengthened you with His help and with the believers;
وَأَلَّفَ بَيْنَ قُلُوبِهِمْ لَوْ أَنفَقْتَ مَا فِي ٱلأَرْضِ جَمِيعاً مَّآ أَلَّفَتْ بَيْنَ قُلُوبِهِمْ وَلَـٰكِنَّ ٱللَّهَ أَلَّفَ بَيْنَهُمْ إِنَّهُ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ,and reconciled brought together their hearts after old feuds had divided them. Had you expended all that is in the earth you could not have reconciled their hearts but God reconciled their hearts through His power. Truly He is Mighty His way prevailing Wise nothing being beyond the scope of His wisdom.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّبِيُّ حَسْبُكَ ٱللَّهُ وَمَنِ ٱتَّبَعَكَ مِنَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,O Prophet God suffices you and the believers who follow you suffice you.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّبِيُّ حَرِّضِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ عَلَى ٱلْقِتَالِ إِن يَكُن مِّنكُمْ عِشْرُونَ صَابِرُونَ يَغْلِبُواْ مِئَتَيْنِ وَإِن يَكُنْ مِّنكُمْ مِّئَةٌ يَغْلِبُوۤاْ أَلْفاً مِّنَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ بِأَنَّهُمْ قَوْمٌ لاَّ يَفْقَهُونَ,O Prophet urge on exhort the believers to fight the disbelievers. If there be twenty of you steadfast they will overcome two hundred of them. If there be read as yakun or takun a hundred of you they will overcome a thousand of those who disbelieve for they are a people who do not understand this sentence is predicative but functions as an imperative in other words let the twenty of you fight the two hundred of them and the hundred of you the thousand of them and let them stand firm against them; but when they became numerous this was abrogated by God’s saying
ٱلآنَ خَفَّفَ ٱللَّهُ عَنكُمْ وَعَلِمَ أَنَّ فِيكُمْ ضَعْفاً فَإِن يَكُنْ مِّنكُمْ مِّئَةٌ صَابِرَةٌ يَغْلِبُواْ مِئَتَيْنِ وَإِن يَكُن مِّنكُمْ أَلْفٌ يَغْلِبُوۤاْ أَلْفَيْنِ بِإِذْنِ ٱللَّهِ وَٱللَّهُ مَعَ ٱلصَّابِرِينَ,Now God has lightened the burden for you for He knows that there is weakness read du‘fan or da‘fan in you making you unable to fight ten times your number. So if there be read as yakun or takun a hundred of you steadfast they will overcome two hundred of them; and if there be a thousand of you they will overcome two thousand by the leave of God by His will this is predicative functioning as an imperative in other words fight twice your number and stand firm against them. And God is with the steadfast by His support of them.
مَا كَانَ لِنَبِيٍّ أَن يَكُونَ لَهُ أَسْرَىٰ حَتَّىٰ يُثْخِنَ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ تُرِيدُونَ عَرَضَ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَٱللَّهُ يُرِيدُ ٱلآخِرَةَ وَٱللَّهُ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ,The following was revealed when they ransomed those taken captive at Badr It is not for any Prophet to have read as an takūna lahu or an yakūna lahu prisoners until he has made slaughter in the land going all the way in fighting disbelievers. You O believers desire the transient things of this world its ephemeral gains by ransoming while God desires for you the Hereafter that is its reward through your killing them; and God is Mighty Wise this was abrogated by His words and set them free afterward either with grace or by ransom Q. 474.
لَّوْلاَ كِتَابٌ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ سَبَقَ لَمَسَّكُمْ فِيمَآ أَخَذْتُمْ عَذَابٌ عَظِيمٌ,Had it not been for an ordinance from God which had preceded making spoils and the taking of captives lawful for you an awful chastisement would have afflicted you for what you took as ransom.
فَكُلُواْ مِمَّا غَنِمْتُمْ حَلاَلاً طَيِّباً وَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,Now eat of what you have plundered as lawful and good and fear God. Truly God is Forgiving Merciful.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّبِيُّ قُل لِّمَن فِيۤ أَيْدِيكُمْ مِّنَ ٱلأَسْرَىٰ إِن يَعْلَمِ ٱللَّهُ فِي قُلُوبِكُمْ خَيْراً يُؤْتِكُمْ خَيْراً مِّمَّآ أُخِذَ مِنكُمْ وَيَغْفِرْ لَكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,O Prophet say to those captives who are in your hands asrā may also be read as asārā ‘If God knows of any good any faith or sincere devotion in your hearts He will give you better than that which has been taken from you by way of ransom by His multiplying it for you in this world and rewarding you in the Hereafter and will forgive you your sins. Truly God is Forgiving Merciful’.
وَإِن يُرِيدُواْ خِيَانَتَكَ فَقَدْ خَانُواْ ٱللَّهَ مِن قَبْلُ فَأَمْكَنَ مِنْهُمْ وَٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ حَكِيمٌ,And if they the captives desire to betray you through words which they speak to you they have betrayed God before before Badr through unbelief; but He has given you power over them at Badr through slaying and capture so let them anticipate the like if they return to betrayal; and God is Knower of His creatures Wise in His actions.
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَهَاجَرُواْ وَجَاهَدُواْ بِأَمْوَالِهِمْ وَأَنْفُسِهِمْ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ وَٱلَّذِينَ ءَاوَواْ وَّنَصَرُوۤاْ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ بَعْضُهُمْ أَوْلِيَآءُ بَعْضٍ وَٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَلَمْ يُهَاجِرُواْ مَا لَكُمْ مِّن وَلاَيَتِهِم مِّن شَيْءٍ حَتَّىٰ يُهَاجِرُواْ وَإِنِ ٱسْتَنصَرُوكُمْ فِي ٱلدِّينِ فَعَلَيْكُمُ ٱلنَّصْرُ إِلاَّ عَلَىٰ قَوْمٍ بَيْنَكُمْ وَبَيْنَهُمْ مِّيثَاقٌ وَٱللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ,Truly those who believed and emigrated and strove with their wealth and their lives in the way of God these being the Emigrants and those who provided refuge for the Prophet s and assisted these being the Helpers those are allies of one another in terms of mutual support and inheritance. And those who believed but did not emigrate — you have no duty to make an alliance read wilāya or walāya with them and so there is no inheriting between you and them and no share of the spoils for them until they emigrate this was abrogated by the end of this sūra; but if they ask you for assistance in the matter of religion then it is your duty to assist them against the disbelievers except against a folk between whom and you there is a covenant a pact in which case do not assist them against these others and so break your pact; and God sees what you do.
وَٱلَّذينَ كَفَرُواْ بَعْضُهُمْ أَوْلِيَآءُ بَعْضٍ إِلاَّ تَفْعَلُوهُ تَكُنْ فِتْنَةٌ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَفَسَادٌ كَبِيرٌ,And those who disbelieve are allies of one another in terms of mutual support and inheritance and so there is no inheriting between you and them. Unless you do this unless you ally yourselves with the believers and sever relations with the disbelievers there will be sedition in the land and great corruption with disbelief gaining power and Islam becoming weak.
وَٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَهَاجَرُواْ وَجَٰهَدُواْ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ وَٱلَّذِينَ ءَاوَواْ وَّنَصَرُوۤاْ أُولَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ حَقّاً لَّهُمْ مَّغْفِرَةٌ وَرِزْقٌ كَرِيمٌ,And those who believed and emigrated and strove for the way of God and those who provided refuge and assisted — those are the true believers and for them is forgiveness and a generous provision in Paradise.
وَٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ مِن بَعْدُ وَهَاجَرُواْ وَجَاهَدُواْ مَعَكُمْ فَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ مِنكُمْ وَأْوْلُواْ ٱلأَرْحَامِ بَعْضُهُمْ أَوْلَىٰ بِبَعْضٍ فِي كِتَابِ ٱللَّهِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عَلِيمٌ,And those who believed afterwards that is after the first believers and emigrants and emigrated and strove with you — they are of you O Muhājirūn and Ansār; and those related by blood kinsmen are nearer to one another in terms of inheritance than those who share inheritance on account of their common faith and emigration mentioned in the previous verse according to the Book of God the Preserved Tablet al-lawh al-mahfūz. Truly God is Knower of all things including the wisdom regarding the rules of inheritance.
بَرَآءَةٌ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ إِلَى ٱلَّذِينَ عَاهَدْتُمْ مِّنَ ٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ,This is A declaration of immunity from God and His Messenger to reach the idolaters with whom you made a pact a pact for an indefinite period of time or one for a period of less than or more than four months; the annulment of the pact shall be as God mentions in His saying
فَسِيحُواْ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ أَرْبَعَةَ أَشْهُرٍ وَٱعْلَمُوۤاْ أَنَّكُمْ غَيْرُ مُعْجِزِي ٱللَّهِ وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ مُخْزِي ٱلْكَافِرِينَ,‘Journey freely travel in security O idolaters in the land for four months — beginning with the month of Shawwāl on the basis of what will come shortly — after which there will be no security for you and know that you cannot escape God that is you shall not elude His punishment and that God degrades the disbelievers’ humiliating them in this world by having them killed and in the Hereafter by sending them to the Fire.
وَأَذَانٌ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ إِلَى ٱلنَّاسِ يَوْمَ ٱلْحَجِّ ٱلأَكْبَرِ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ بَرِيۤءٌ مِّنَ ٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ وَرَسُولُهُ فَإِن تُبْتُمْ فَهُوَ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ وَإِن تَوَلَّيْتُمْ فَٱعْلَمُوۤاْ أَنَّكُمْ غَيْرُ مُعْجِزِي ٱللَّهِ وَبَشِّرِ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ بِعَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ,A proclamation a notification from God and His Messenger to mankind on the day of the Greater Pilgrimage the Day of Sacrifice yawm al-nahr that God is free from obligation to the idolaters and their pacts and so is His Messenger also free from obligation in that same year year 9 of the Hijra the Prophet s sent forth ‘Alī who proclaimed these verses on the Day of Sacrifice at Minā and also he proclaimed that after this year no idolater will be allowed to make pilgrimage or circumambulate the House naked as reported by al-Bukhārī. So if you repent of unbelief it will be better for you; but if you turn away from belief then know that you cannot escape God. And give tidings to — inform — those who disbelieve of a painful chastisement namely of slaughter or capture in this world and of punishment in the Fire in the Hereafter.
إِلاَّ ٱلَّذِينَ عَاهَدتُّم مِّنَ ٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ ثُمَّ لَمْ يَنقُصُوكُمْ شَيْئاً وَلَمْ يُظَاهِرُواْ عَلَيْكُمْ أَحَداً فَأَتِمُّوۤاْ إِلَيْهِمْ عَهْدَهُمْ إِلَىٰ مُدَّتِهِمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُحِبُّ ٱلْمُتَّقِينَ,Excepting those of the idolaters with whom you have made a pact and who have not diminished their commitment to you in anyway with regard to the terms of the pact nor supported assisted anyone from among the disbelievers against you; as for these fulfil your pact with them until the completion of the term to which you have agreed. Truly God loves those who fear Him by fulfilling pacts.
فَإِذَا ٱنسَلَخَ ٱلأَشْهُرُ ٱلْحُرُمُ فَٱقْتُلُواْ ٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ حَيْثُ وَجَدتُّمُوهُمْ وَخُذُوهُمْ وَٱحْصُرُوهُمْ وَٱقْعُدُواْ لَهُمْ كُلَّ مَرْصَدٍ فَإِن تَابُواْ وَأَقَامُواْ ٱلصَّلَٰوةَ وَءَاتَوُاْ ٱلزَّكَٰوةَ فَخَلُّواْ سَبِيلَهُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,Then when the sacred months have passed — that is at the end of the period of deferment — slay the idolaters wherever you find them be it during a lawful period or a sacred one and take them captive and confine them to castles and forts until they have no choice except being put to death or acceptance of Islam; and lie in wait for them at every place of ambush at every route that they use kulla ‘every’ is in the accusative because a preceding genitive-taking preposition has been removed. But if they repent of unbelief and establish prayer and pay the alms then leave their way free and do not interfere with them. God is Forgiving Merciful to those who repent.
وَإِنْ أَحَدٌ مِّنَ ٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ ٱسْتَجَارَكَ فَأَجِرْهُ حَتَّىٰ يَسْمَعَ كَلاَمَ ٱللَّهِ ثُمَّ أَبْلِغْهُ مَأْمَنَهُ ذٰلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ قَوْمٌ لاَّ يَعْلَمُونَ,And if any one of the idolaters ahadun ‘one’ is in the nominative because of the following verb istajāraka ‘seeks your protection’ that validates it seeks your protection requests security from you against being killed then grant him protection provide security for him so that he might hear the words of God — the Qur’ān — and afterward convey him to his place of security that is the dwelling-places of his folk if he does not believe so that he might reflect upon his situation — that which is mentioned is because they are a people who do not know the religion of God and so they must be made to hear the Qur’ān in order to come to know religion.
كَيْفَ يَكُونُ لِلْمُشْرِكِينَ عَهْدٌ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ وَعِندَ رَسُولِهِ إِلاَّ ٱلَّذِينَ عَاهَدْتُمْ عِندَ ٱلْمَسْجِدِ ٱلْحَرَامِ فَمَا ٱسْتَقَامُواْ لَكُمْ فَٱسْتَقِيمُواْ لَهُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُحِبُّ ٱلْمُتَّقِينَ,How can the idolaters have a pact with God and His Messenger — they cannot —while they disbelieve in God and His Messenger acting treacherously; except for those with whom you made a pact at the Sacred Mosque? the day of al-Hudaybiyya — these were Quraysh for whom an exception was made earlier Q. 94. So long as they are true to you keeping to the pact and not breaking it be true to them by fulfilling it fa-mā ‘so long as’ the mā is a conditional particle. Truly God loves the God-fearing the Prophet s had kept to the pact made with them until they broke it by supporting the Banū Bakr against Khuzā‘a.
كَيْفَ وَإِن يَظْهَرُوا عَلَيْكُمْ لاَ يَرْقُبُواْ فِيكُمْ إِلاًّ وَلاَ ذِمَّةً يُرْضُونَكُم بِأَفْوَاهِهِمْ وَتَأْبَىٰ قُلُوبُهُمْ وَأَكْثَرُهُمْ فَاسِقُونَ,How can they have a pact when if they get the better of you if they have the upper hand over you they do not respect they do not take into consideration any bond kinship or treaty pact with regard to you but will instead harm you as much as they can the conditional sentence ‘if they …’ is also a circumstantial qualifier pleasing you with their tongues with charming words while their hearts refuse to be true to these words; and most of them are wicked violators of pacts.
ٱشْتَرَوْاْ بِآيَاتِ ٱللَّهِ ثَمَناً قَلِيلاً فَصَدُّواْ عَن سَبِيلِهِ إِنَّهُمْ سَآءَ مَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ,They have purchased with the signs of God the Qur’ān a small price of this world that is they have refrained from following them in favour of passions and whims and have barred people from His way His religion. Truly evil is that deed of theirs which they are wont to do.
لاَ يَرْقُبُونَ فِي مُؤْمِنٍ إِلاًّ وَلاَ ذِمَّةً وَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْمُعْتَدُونَ,They respect neither bond of kinship nor treaty with regard to a believer; those they are the transgressors.
فَإِن تَابُواْ وَأَقَامُواْ ٱلصَّلَٰوةَ وَءَاتَوُاْ ٱلزَّكَٰوةَ فَإِخْوَٰنُكُمْ فِي ٱلدِّينِ وَنُفَصِّلُ ٱلأيَـٰتِ لِقَوْمٍ يَعْلَمُونَ,Yet if they repent and establish prayer and pay the alms then they are your brothers in religion; and We detail We explain the signs for a people who know who reflect.
وَإِن نَّكَثُوۤاْ أَيْمَانَهُم مِّن بَعْدِ عَهْدِهِمْ وَطَعَنُواْ فِي دِينِكُمْ فَقَاتِلُوۤاْ أَئِمَّةَ ٱلْكُفْرِ إِنَّهُمْ لاَ أَيْمَانَ لَهُمْ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَنتَهُونَ,But if they break if they violate their oaths their covenants after making their pact and assail your religion slander it then fight the leaders of unbelief its heads here an overt noun ‘the leaders of unbelief’ has replaced the third person pronominalisation — verily they have no binding oaths no pacts a variant reading for aymān ‘oaths’ has the kasra inflection for the alif sc. īmān ‘no faith’ — so that they might desist from unbelief.
أَلاَ تُقَاتِلُونَ قَوْماً نَّكَثُوۤاْ أَيْمَانَهُمْ وَهَمُّواْ بِإِخْرَاجِ ٱلرَّسُولِ وَهُم بَدَءُوكُمْ أَوَّلَ مَرَّةٍ أَتَخْشَوْنَهُمْ فَٱللَّهُ أَحَقُّ أَن تَخْشَوْهُ إِن كُنتُمْ مُّؤُمِنِينَ,Will you not a-lā ‘will not’ or ‘is not’ denotes incitement fight a people who broke violated their oaths their pacts and intended to expel the Messenger from Mecca — for they discussed this between them in their council assembly — initiating combat against you first? when they fought alongside Banū Bakr against Khuzā‘a your allies? So what is stopping you from fighting them? Are you afraid of them? God is more worthy of your fear when you fail to fight them if you are believers.
قَاتِلُوهُمْ يُعَذِّبْهُمُ ٱللَّهُ بِأَيْدِيكُمْ وَيُخْزِهِمْ وَيَنْصُرْكُمْ عَلَيْهِمْ وَيَشْفِ صُدُورَ قَوْمٍ مُّؤْمِنِينَ,Fight them and God will chastise them He will have them killed at your hands and degrade them humiliate them through capture and subjugation and He will give you victory against them and He will heal the breasts of a people who believe removing the harm done to them — these are the Banū Khuzā‘a.
وَيُذْهِبْ غَيْظَ قُلُوبِهِمْ وَيَتُوبُ ٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ مَن يَشَآءُ وَٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ حَكِيمٌ,And He will remove the rage the grief in their hearts. God turns in forgiveness to whomever He will when they return to Islam as in the case of Abū Sufyān. And God is Knowing Wise.
أَمْ حَسِبْتُمْ أَن تُتْرَكُواْ وَلَمَّا يَعْلَمِ ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِينَ جَاهَدُواْ مِنكُمْ وَلَمْ يَتَّخِذُواْ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ وَلاَ رَسُولِهِ وَلاَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَلِيجَةً وَٱللَّهُ خَبِيرٌ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ,Or am has the meaning of the initial a- hamza used to express disavowal did you suppose that you would be left in peace when God does not yet know that is through knowledge outwardly manifested those of you who have struggled sincerely and have not taken besides God and His Messenger and the believers an intimate friend? as a confidant or an ally? In other words when it has not yet become manifest who the sincere ones are — those described in the exclusive way mentioned. And God is aware of what you do.
مَا كَانَ لِلْمُشْرِكِينَ أَن يَعْمُرُواْ مَسَٰجِدَ ٱللهِ شَٰهِدِينَ عَلَىٰ أَنْفُسِهِمْ بِالْكُفْرِ أُوْلَئِكَ حَبِطَتْ أَعْمَٰلُهُمْ وَفِي ٱلنَّارِ هُمْ خَٰلِدُونَ,It is not for the idolaters to attend God’s places of worship masājid is also read in the singular masjid entering them or sitting in them bearing witness against themselves to unbelief; those their works have failed their works are invalid and in the Fire they shall abide.
إِنَّمَا يَعْمُرُ مَسَٰجِدَ ٱللَّهِ مَنْ ءَامَنَ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلآخِرِ وَأَقَامَ ٱلصَّلَٰوةَ وَءَاتَىٰ ٱلزَّكَٰوةَ وَلَمْ يَخْشَ إِلاَّ ٱللَّهَ فَعَسَىٰ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ أَن يَكُونُواْ مِنَ ٱلْمُهْتَدِينَ,Only he shall attend God’s places of worship who believes in God and the Last Day and observes prayer and pays the alms and fears none but God alone; it may be that those will be among the rightly guided.
أَجَعَلْتُمْ سِقَايَةَ ٱلْحَاجِّ وَعِمَارَةَ ٱلْمَسْجِدِ ٱلْحَرَامِ كَمَنْ آمَنَ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلآخِرِ وَجَاهَدَ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ لاَ يَسْتَوُونَ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ وَٱللَّهُ لاَ يَهْدِي ٱلْقَوْمَ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ,Do you reckon the giving of water to pilgrims and the attendance of the Sacred Mosque that is do you reckon those who do such things to be the same as he who believes in God and the Last Day and struggles in the way of God? They are not equal in merit in God’s sight; and God guides not the evildoing the disbelieving folk this was revealed to refute those who claimed this such as al-‘Abbās and others.
ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَهَاجَرُواْ وَجَاهَدُواْ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ بِأَمْوَالِهِمْ وَأَنْفُسِهِمْ أَعْظَمُ دَرَجَةً عِندَ ٱللَّهِ وَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْفَائِزُونَ,Those who believe and have emigrated and have struggled in the way of God with their possessions and their lives are greater in degree in rank with God than others; and those they are the triumphant the ones who will attain good.
يُبَشِّرُهُمْ رَبُّهُم بِرَحْمَةٍ مِّنْهُ وَرِضْوَانٍ وَجَنَّاتٍ لَّهُمْ فِيهَا نَعِيمٌ مُّقِيمٌ,Their Lord gives them good tidings of mercy from Him and beatitude; for them shall be gardens wherein is enduring everlasting bliss
خَالِدِينَ فِيهَآ أَبَداً إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عِندَهُ أَجْرٌ عَظِيمٌ,therein they shall abide forever khālidīna is an implied circumstance. Surely with God is a tremendous reward.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ لاَ تَتَّخِذُوۤاْ آبَآءَكُمْ وَإِخْوَانَكُمْ أَوْلِيَآءَ إِنِ ٱسْتَحَبُّواْ ٱلْكُفْرَ عَلَى ٱلإِيمَانِ وَمَن يَتَوَلَّهُمْ مِّنكُمْ فَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلظَّالِمُونَ,The following was revealed regarding those who refrained from emigrating because of their families and trade O you who believe do not take your fathers and brothers for your friends if they prefer if they have chosen disbelief over belief; whoever of you takes them for friends such are the evildoers.
قُلْ إِن كَانَ آبَاؤُكُمْ وَأَبْنَآؤُكُمْ وَإِخْوَانُكُمْ وَأَزْوَاجُكُمْ وَعَشِيرَتُكُمْ وَأَمْوَالٌ ٱقْتَرَفْتُمُوهَا وَتِجَارَةٌ تَخْشَوْنَ كَسَادَهَا وَمَسَاكِنُ تَرْضَوْنَهَآ أَحَبَّ إِلَيْكُمْ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ وَجِهَادٍ فِي سَبِيلِهِ فَتَرَبَّصُواْ حَتَّىٰ يَأْتِيَ ٱللَّهُ بِأَمْرِهِ وَٱللَّهُ لاَ يَهْدِي ٱلْقَوْمَ ٱلْفَاسِقِينَ,Say ‘If your fathers and your sons and your brothers and your wives and your clan your kinsmen ‘ashīratukum a variant reading has ‘ashīrātukum and the possessions which you have acquired and merchandise for which you fear there may be no sale no longer viable and dwellings which you love are dearer to you than God and His Messenger and struggling in His way so that you have refrained from emigrating and struggling for the sake of such things then wait until God brings about His command — this is meant as a threat to them. And God does not guide the wicked folk’.
لَقَدْ نَصَرَكُمُ ٱللَّهُ فِي مَوَاطِنَ كَثِيرَةٍ وَيَوْمَ حُنَيْنٍ إِذْ أَعْجَبَتْكُمْ كَثْرَتُكُمْ فَلَمْ تُغْنِ عَنكُمْ شَيْئاً وَضَاقَتْ عَلَيْكُمُ ٱلأَرْضُ بِمَا رَحُبَتْ ثُمَّ وَلَّيْتُم مُّدْبِرِينَ,God has already helped you on many fields of battle such as Badr and against Qurayza and al-Nadīr and remember on the day of Hunayn — a valley between Mecca and Tā’if; that is remember the day on which you fought Hawāzin — this was in Shawwāl in year 8 of the Hijra when idh substitutes for yawma ‘the day’ your vast numbers were pleasing to you such that you were saying ‘We shall not be defeated today not on account of our being few’ and they numbered 12000 while the disbelievers were 4000; but it availed you nothing and the earth for all its breadth bi-mā rahubat the mā refers to the verbal noun in other words understand it as being ma‘a rahbihā ‘despite its breadth’ it was straitened for you such that you could not find a place in which you felt secure because of the severe fear that afflicted you; then you turned back retreating fleeing the Prophet s however on his white mule remained firm with only al-‘Abbās by his side while Abū Sufyān was charging on his mount.
ثُمَّ أَنَزلَ ٱللَّهُ سَكِينَتَهُ عَلَىٰ رَسُولِهِ وَعَلَى ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَأَنزَلَ جُنُوداً لَّمْ تَرَوْهَا وَعذَّبَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَذٰلِكَ جَزَآءُ ٱلْكَافِرِينَ,Then God sent down His Spirit of Peace His reassurance upon His Messenger and upon the believers and so they turned back towards the Prophet s after al-‘Abbās called them with his the Prophet’s permission and they fought once again; and He sent down legions of angels you did not see and chastised the disbelievers with slaughter and capture and that is the requital of the disbelievers.
ثُمَّ يَتُوبُ ٱللَّهُ مِن بَعْدِ ذٰلِكَ عَلَىٰ مَن يَشَآءُ وَٱللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,Then afterwards God will relent to whom He will from among them by their acceptance of Islam. And God is Forgiving Merciful.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُوۤاْ إِنَّمَا ٱلْمُشْرِكُونَ نَجَسٌ فَلاَ يَقْرَبُواْ ٱلْمَسْجِدَ ٱلْحَرَامَ بَعْدَ عَامِهِمْ هَـٰذَا وَإِنْ خِفْتُمْ عَيْلَةً فَسَوْفَ يُغْنِيكُمُ ٱللَّهُ مِن فَضْلِهِ إِن شَآءَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلِيمٌ حَكِيمٌ,O you who believe the idolaters are indeed unclean they are filth on account of their inner vileness so do not let them come near the Sacred Mosque that is let them not enter the Sanctuary after this year of theirs year 9 of the Hijra. If you fear impoverishment poverty as a result of the cessation of their commerce with you God will surely enrich you from His bounty if He will and He indeed enriched them through conquests and the imposition of the jizya. God is Knowing Wise.
قَاتِلُواْ ٱلَّذِينَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱللَّهِ وَلاَ بِٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلآخِرِ وَلاَ يُحَرِّمُونَ مَا حَرَّمَ ٱللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُ وَلاَ يَدِينُونَ دِينَ ٱلْحَقِّ مِنَ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ ٱلْكِتَابَ حَتَّىٰ يُعْطُواْ ٱلْجِزْيَةَ عَن يَدٍ وَهُمْ صَاغِرُونَ,Fight those who do not believe in God nor in the Last Day for otherwise they would have believed in the Prophet s and who do not forbid what God and His Messenger have forbidden such as wine nor do they practise the religion of truth the firm one the one that abrogated other religions namely the religion of Islam — from among of those who min ‘from’ explains the previous alladhīna ‘those who’ have been given the Scripture namely the Jews and the Christians until they pay the jizya tribute the annual tax imposed them readily ‘an yadin is a circumstantial qualifier meaning ‘compliantly’ or ‘by their own hands’ not delegating it to others to pay being subdued being made submissive and compliant to the authority of Islam.
وَقَالَتِ ٱلْيَهُودُ عُزَيْرٌ ٱبْنُ ٱللَّهِ وَقَالَتْ ٱلنَّصَارَى ٱلْمَسِيحُ ٱبْنُ ٱللَّهِ ذٰلِكَ قَوْلُهُم بِأَفْوَاهِهِمْ يُضَاهِئُونَ قَوْلَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِن قَبْلُ قَاتَلَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ أَنَّىٰ يُؤْفَكُونَ,The Jews say Ezra is the son of God; and the Christians say The Messiah Jesus is the son of God. That is the utterance of their mouths for which they have no support nay imitating the utterances of those who disbelieved before them from among their forefathers mimicking them. God assail curse them! How they are deviated! turned away from the truth despite the proofs having been established.
ٱتَّخَذُوۤاْ أَحْبَارَهُمْ وَرُهْبَانَهُمْ أَرْبَاباً مِّن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ وَٱلْمَسِيحَ ٱبْنَ مَرْيَمَ وَمَآ أُمِرُوۤاْ إِلاَّ لِيَعْبُدُوۤاْ إِلَـٰهاً وَاحِداً لاَّ إِلَـٰهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ سُبْحَانَهُ عَمَّا يُشْرِكُونَ,They have taken their rabbis the scholars among the Jews and their monks the devout among the Christians as lords beside God — following them in making lawful what God has made unlawful and making unlawful what He has made lawful — and the Messiah son of Mary when they were not commanded in the Torah and the Gospel except to worship One God there is no god except Him; glory be to Him as an affirmation of His transcendence high above what they associate with Him.
يُرِيدُونَ أَن يُطْفِئُواْ نُورَ ٱللَّهِ بِأَفْوَٰهِهِمْ وَيَأْبَىٰ ٱللَّهُ إِلاَّ أَن يُتِمَّ نُورَهُ وَلَوْ كَرِهَ ٱلْكَٰفِرُونَ,They desire to extinguish God’s light His Law and His proofs with their tongues with what they say about Him; and God refuses but to perfect to make manifest His light even though the disbelievers be averse to this.
هُوَ ٱلَّذِيۤ أَرْسَلَ رَسُولَهُ بِٱلْهُدَىٰ وَدِينِ ٱلْحَقِّ لِيُظْهِرَهُ عَلَى ٱلدِّينِ كُلِّهِ وَلَوْ كَرِهَ ٱلْمُشْرِكُونَ,He it is Who has sent His Messenger Muhammad (s) with the guidance and the religion of truth that He may manifest it make it prevail over every religion all the religions which oppose it even though the disbelievers be averse to this.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ إِنَّ كَثِيراً مِّنَ ٱلأَحْبَارِ وَٱلرُّهْبَانِ لَيَأْكُلُونَ أَمْوَالَ ٱلنَّاسِ بِٱلْبَاطِلِ وَيَصُدُّونَ عَن سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ وَٱلَّذِينَ يَكْنِزُونَ ٱلذَّهَبَ وَٱلْفِضَّةَ وَلاَ يُنفِقُونَهَا فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ فَبَشِّرْهُمْ بِعَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ,O you who believe many of the rabbis and monks indeed consume take people’s goods by false means as in the case of bribes paid for judgements and bar people from the way of God from His religion. And those who wa’lladhīna is the subject hoard up gold and silver and do not expend them these treasure-hoards in the way of God that is they do not pay from it what is due to Him by way of alms and charity — give them tidings inform them of a painful chastisement.
يَوْمَ يُحْمَىٰ عَلَيْهَا فِي نَارِ جَهَنَّمَ فَتُكْوَىٰ بِهَا جِبَاهُهُمْ وَجُنوبُهُمْ وَظُهُورُهُمْ هَـٰذَا مَا كَنَزْتُمْ لأَنْفُسِكُمْ فَذُوقُواْ مَا كُنتُمْ تَكْنِزُونَ,On the day when it shall be heated in the fire of Hell and therewith their foreheads and their sides and their backs shall be branded burnt — their skins will be stretched until these hoards of gold and silver can be placed on them entirely and it will be said to them ‘This is what you hoarded up for yourselves so taste now what you used to hoard!’ that is taste its requital.
إِنَّ عِدَّةَ ٱلشُّهُورِ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ ٱثْنَا عَشَرَ شَهْراً فِي كِتَابِ ٱللَّهِ يَوْمَ خَلَقَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضَ مِنْهَآ أَرْبَعَةٌ حُرُمٌ ذٰلِكَ ٱلدِّينُ ٱلْقَيِّمُ فَلاَ تَظْلِمُواْ فِيهِنَّ أَنْفُسَكُمْ وَقَاتِلُواْ ٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ كَآفَّةً كَمَا يُقَاتِلُونَكُمْ كَآفَّةً وَٱعْلَمُوۤاْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ مَعَ ٱلْمُتَّقِينَ,Verily the number of months used to reckon the year with God is twelve months in the Book of God the Preserved Tablet al-lawh al-mahfūz from the day that He created the heavens and the earth; four of them that is the months are sacred inviolable Dhū’l-Qa‘da Dhū’l-Hijja Muharram and Rajab. That making of them sacred is the right the upright religion. So do not wrong yourselves during them during these sacred months with acts of disobedience for their burden of sin is greater therein; but it is also said to mean do not wrong yourselves at any time during all the months of the year. And fight the idolaters altogether all of them throughout the months even as they fight you altogether; and know that God is with those who fear Him supporting and assisting them.
إِنَّمَا ٱلنَّسِيۤءُ زِيَادَةٌ فِي ٱلْكُفْرِ يُضَلُّ بِهِ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ يُحِلُّونَهُ عَاماً وَيُحَرِّمُونَهُ عَاماً لِّيُوَاطِئُواْ عِدَّةَ مَا حَرَّمَ ٱللَّهُ فَيُحِلُّواْ مَا حَرَّمَ ٱللَّهُ زُيِّنَ لَهُمْ سُوۤءُ أَعْمَالِهِمْ وَٱللَّهُ لاَ يَهْدِي ٱلْقَوْمَ ٱلْكَافِرِينَ,Postponement of the sacred month — that is the deferment of the sacredness of a given month to another as they used to do during paganism such as postponing the sacredness of Muharram if it arrives while they are at war to Safar — is only an excess of unbelief because of their rejection of God’s ruling thereof whereby those who disbelieve are led astray yudallu may also be read yadillu ‘they go astray’ one year they make it the month postponed profane and hallow it another that they may make up by profaning one month and hallowing another in its place the number of months which God has hallowed such that they do not hallow more or less than the four months but without observing the individual months themselves; and so they profane what God has hallowed. Their evil deeds have been adorned for them such that they deem them to be good deeds; and God does not guide the disbelieving folk.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ مَا لَكُمْ إِذَا قِيلَ لَكُمُ ٱنفِرُواْ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ ٱثَّاقَلْتُمْ إِلَى ٱلأَرْضِ أَرَضِيتُمْ بِٱلْحَيَاةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا مِنَ ٱلآخِرَةِ فَمَا مَتَاعُ ٱلْحَيَاةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا فِي ٱلآخِرَةِ إِلاَّ قَلِيلٌ,When the Prophet s summoned men for the Tabūk campaign and they thought it too burdensome because of the hardship and the extreme heat from which they were suffering the following was revealed O you who believe what is wrong with you that when it is said to you ‘Go forth in the way of God’ you sink down heavily iththāqaltum the original tā’ of tathāqaltum has been assimilated with the thā’ and the conjunctive hamza has been supplied in other words you hesitate and are disinclined to participate in the struggle to the ground to stay sitting upon it? the interrogative is meant as a rebuke. Are you so content with the life of this world and its delights rather than with the Hereafter? that is in place of its bliss? Yet the enjoyment of the life of this world is in comparison with the enjoyment of the Hereafter but little trivial.
إِلاَّ تَنفِرُواْ يُعَذِّبْكُمْ عَذَاباً أَلِيماً وَيَسْتَبْدِلْ قَوْماً غَيْرَكُمْ وَلاَ تَضُرُّوهُ شَيْئاً وَٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,If illā lā has been assimilated with the nūn of the conditional particle in in both instances here and in the next verse you do not go forth if you do not set out with the Prophet s for the struggle He will chastise you with a painful chastisement and He will substitute you with another folk other than you that is He will bring them in your place and you will not hurt Him that is God or ‘him’ as being the Prophet s at all should you neglect to help him to victory for God Himself will indeed bring victory to His religion; for God has power over all things including bringing victory to His religion and His Prophet.
إِلاَّ تَنصُرُوهُ فَقَدْ نَصَرَهُ ٱللَّهُ إِذْ أَخْرَجَهُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ ثَانِيَ ٱثْنَيْنِ إِذْ هُمَا فِي ٱلْغَارِ إِذْ يَقُولُ لِصَاحِبِهِ لاَ تَحْزَنْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ مَعَنَا فَأَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ سَكِينَتَهُ عَلَيْهِ وَأَيَّدَهُ بِجُنُودٍ لَّمْ تَرَوْهَا وَجَعَلَ كَلِمَةَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ ٱلسُّفْلَىٰ وَكَلِمَةُ ٱللَّهِ هِيَ ٱلْعُلْيَا وَٱللَّهُ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ,If you do not help him that is the Prophet s know that God has already helped him when the disbelievers drove him forth from Mecca that is they made him resort to leaving when they desired to kill him or imprison him or banish him at the council assembly — the second of two thāniya ithnayn this is a circumstantial qualifier that is one of two the other being Abū Bakr in other words just as God helped him in such a situation He will not forsake him in another; when idh substitutes for the previous idh the two were in the cave — a breach in the mountain called Thawr — when idh substituting again he said to his companion Abū Bakr — who upon perceiving the sound of the feet of the idolaters nearby had said to him ‘If one of them should merely look below his feet he will definitely see us!’ — ‘Do not despair; verily God is with us’ assisting us. Then God sent down His Spirit of Peace upon him His reassurance — some say this means upon the Prophet others that it means upon Abū Bakr — and supported him that is the Prophet s with legions of angels you did not see both in the cave and in the locations in which he fought battles; and He made the word of those who disbelieved that is the call to idolatry the nethermost the one vanquished and the Word of God that is the profession of His Oneness shahāda was the uppermost the one prevailing and triumphant. And God is Mighty in His Kingdom Wise in His actions.
ٱنْفِرُواْ خِفَافاً وَثِقَالاً وَجَاهِدُواْ بِأَمْوَالِكُمْ وَأَنْفُسِكُمْ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ ذٰلِكُمْ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ,Go forth light and heavy! that is energetically or not; it is also said to mean go forth strong or weak or rich or poor — but this was abrogated by the verse The weak would not be at fault … Q. 991. Struggle in the way of God with your possessions and your lives that is better for you if only you knew that it is better for you; so do not sink down heavily.
لَوْ كَانَ عَرَضاً قَرِيباً وَسَفَراً قَاصِداً لاَّتَّبَعُوكَ وَلَـٰكِن بَعُدَتْ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلشُّقَّةُ وَسَيَحْلِفُونَ بِٱللَّهِ لَوِ ٱسْتَطَعْنَا لَخَرَجْنَا مَعَكُمْ يُهْلِكُونَ أَنْفُسَهُمْ وَٱللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ إِنَّهُمْ لَكَاذِبُونَ,The following was revealed regarding the hypocrites who stayed behind away from the campaign Had it — that to which you summon them — been a near easily acquired gain a transient pleasure of this world and an easy journey of moderate length they would have followed you seeking spoils; but the distance the hardship was too great for them and so they stayed behind. Still they will swear by God when you return to them saying ‘Had we been able to go forth we would have gone forth with you’ destroying their souls by swearing false oaths and God knows that they truly are liars in this saying of theirs.
عَفَا ٱللَّهُ عَنكَ لِمَ أَذِنتَ لَهُمْ حَتَّىٰ يَتَبَيَّنَ لَكَ ٱلَّذِينَ صَدَقُواْ وَتَعْلَمَ ٱلْكَاذِبِينَ,The Prophet s exercising his personal judgement had given leave to a group to stay behind and so the following was revealed as a reprimand for him but with the pardon first in order to reassure his heart May God pardon you! Why do you give them leave to stay behind; why did you not leave them until it was clear to you which of them spoke the truth in their excuse and you knew those who were lying in it?
لاَ يَسْتَأْذِنُكَ ٱلَّذِينَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلآخِرِ أَن يُجَاهِدُواْ بِأَمْوَالِهِمْ وَأَنْفُسِهِمْ وَٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ بِٱلْمُتَّقِينَ,Those who believe in God and the Last Day do not ask leave of you to stay behind that they may struggle with their possessions and their lives; and God knows the pious.
إِنَّمَا يَسْتَأْذِنُكَ ٱلَّذِينَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلآخِرِ وَٱرْتَابَتْ قُلُوبُهُمْ فَهُمْ فِي رَيْبِهِمْ يَتَرَدَّدُونَ,They alone ask leave of you to stay behind who do not believe in God and the Last Day and whose hearts are doubtful uncertain about religion so in their doubt they waver they are confused.
وَلَوْ أَرَادُواْ ٱلْخُرُوجَ لأَعَدُّواْ لَهُ عُدَّةً وَلَـٰكِن كَرِهَ ٱللَّهُ ٱنبِعَاثَهُمْ فَثَبَّطَهُمْ وَقِيلَ ٱقْعُدُواْ مَعَ ٱلْقَاعِدِينَ,If they had desired to go forth with you they would have made some preparation for it some equipment such as tools and provisions but God was averse that they should be sent forth that is He did not want them to go forth so He slowed them down He made them feel lethargic and it was said to them ‘Stay back with those who stay back!’ with the sick the women and the children in other words God decreed this.
لَوْ خَرَجُواْ فِيكُم مَّا زَادُوكُمْ إِلاَّ خَبَالاً ولأَوْضَعُواْ خِلاَلَكُمْ يَبْغُونَكُمُ ٱلْفِتْنَةَ وَفِيكُمْ سَمَّاعُونَ لَهُمْ وَٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ بِٱلظَّالِمِينَ,Had they gone forth among you they would only have caused you more trouble more corruption by abandoning the believers and would have hurried to and fro among you that is they would have hastened to spread slander among you seeking desiring to stir up sedition by casting enmity between you; and among you there are some who would listen to them to what they say listening in readiness to accept it; and God knows the evildoers.
لَقَدِ ٱبْتَغَوُاْ ٱلْفِتْنَةَ مِن قَبْلُ وَقَلَّبُواْ لَكَ ٱلأُمُورَ حَتَّىٰ جَآءَ ٱلْحَقُّ وَظَهَرَ أَمْرُ ٱللَّهِ وَهُمْ كَارِهُونَ,Indeed they sought to stir up sedition against you already before when you first came to Medina and scrutinised your affairs that is they thought long and hard how to plot against you and invalidate your religion until the truth the victorious help came and God’s command His religion prevailed stood mighty they still being averse to it His religion entering it superficially.
وَمِنْهُمْ مَّن يَقُولُ ٱئْذَن لِّي وَلاَ تَفْتِنِّي أَلا فِي ٱلْفِتْنَةِ سَقَطُواْ وَإِنَّ جَهَنَّمَ لَمُحِيطَةٌ بِٱلْكَافِرِينَ,And there are some of them who say ‘Grant me leave to stay behind and do not lead me into temptation’ this was al-Jadd b. Qays to whom the Prophet s said ‘Will you do battle against the Byzantines?’ and to which he replied ‘I am infatuated with women and I fear that if I were to see these Byzantine women I shall not be able to stay away from them and be led into temptation’. God exalted be He says Surely they have already fallen into temptation! by staying behind a variant reading for saqatū ‘they have fallen’ has the singular form saqat ‘he has fallen’. And surely Hell shall encompass the disbelievers for whom there shall be no escape therefrom.
إِن تُصِبْكَ حَسَنَةٌ تَسُؤْهُمْ وَإِن تُصِبْكَ مُصِيبَةٌ يَقُولُواْ قَدْ أَخَذْنَا أَمْرَنَا مِن قَبْلُ وَيَتَوَلَّواْ وَّهُمْ فَرِحُونَ,If good fortune such as a victory or a taking of some spoils befalls you it vexes them; but if an affliction some hardship befalls you they say ‘We took our precaution judiciously — when we stayed behind — before’ before this act of disobedience; and they turn away rejoicing at what has afflicted you.
قُل لَّن يُصِيبَنَآ إِلاَّ مَا كَتَبَ ٱللَّهُ لَنَا هُوَ مَوْلاَنَا وَعَلَى ٱللَّهِ فَلْيَتَوَكَّلِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ,Say to them ‘Nothing shall afflict us but that which God has decreed for us that we be afflicted thereby; He is our Protector our Helper and the One in charge of our affairs; in God let the believers put their trust’.
قُلْ هَلْ تَرَبَّصُونَ بِنَآ إِلاَّ إِحْدَى ٱلْحُسْنَيَيْنِ وَنَحْنُ نَتَرَبَّصُ بِكُمْ أَن يُصِيبَكُمُ ٱللَّهُ بِعَذَابٍ مِّنْ عِندِهِ أَوْ بِأَيْدِينَا فَتَرَبَّصُوۤاْ إِنَّا مَعَكُمْ مُّتَرَبِّصُونَ,Say ‘Are you waiting tarabbasūn one of the two original tā’ letters in tatarabbasūn has been omitted for anything to occur for us but one of the two fair things the two fair outcomes? husnayayn is the dual form of husnā which is the feminine form of ahsan that is victory or martyrdom? We are waiting in your case too for God to afflict you with a chastisement from Him with a calamity from the heaven or at our hands should we be given permission to fight you. So wait for this to befall us we are also waiting with you’ your end.
قُلْ أَنفِقُواْ طَوْعاً أَوْ كَرْهاً لَّن يُتَقَبَّلَ مِنكُمْ إِنَّكُمْ كُنتُمْ قَوْماً فَاسِقِينَ,Say ‘Expend in obedience to God willingly or unwillingly it what you expend shall not be accepted from you; you are surely a wicked folk’ the imperative statement here also functions as a predicate.
وَمَا مَنَعَهُمْ أَن تُقْبَلَ مِنْهُمْ نَفَقَاتُهُمْ إِلاَّ أَنَّهُمْ كَفَرُواْ بِٱللَّهِ وَبِرَسُولِهِ وَلاَ يَأْتُونَ ٱلصَّلاَةَ إِلاَّ وَهُمْ كُسَالَىٰ وَلاَ يُنفِقُونَ إِلاَّ وَهُمْ كَارِهُونَ,And nothing prevents their expenditure from being accepted read as yuqbala or tuqbala from them but that they innahum is the subject of the verb while an tuqbala ‘being accepted’ constitutes the object have disbelieved in God and His Messenger and that they do not come to perform prayer save as idlers sluggishly and that they do not expend without their being reluctant to expend for they consider it a financial penalty.
فَلاَ تُعْجِبْكَ أَمْوَٰلُهُمْ وَلاَ أَوْلَـٰدُهُمْ إِنَّمَا يُرِيدُ ٱللَّهُ لِيُعَذِّبَهُمْ بِهَا فِي ٱلْحَيَٰوةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَتَزْهَقَ أَنفُسُهُمْ وَهُمْ كَٰفِرُونَ,So do not let their wealth or their children please you that is do not deem fair Our graces to them for this is a way of drawing them on by degrees to punish them God only desires thereby to chastise them in the life of this world by way of the hardship that they encounter in amassing such wealth and children and the calamities they suffer as a result thereof; and that their souls should depart while they are disbelievers so He punishes them in the Hereafter with the worst punishment.
وَيَحْلِفُونَ بِٱللَّهِ إِنَّهُمْ لَمِنكُمْ وَمَا هُم مِّنكُمْ وَلَـٰكِنَّهُمْ قَوْمٌ يَفْرَقُونَ,And they swear by God that they truly are of you that is that they are believers; but they are not of you; they are a folk who are afraid that you should deal with them as you have done with the idolaters and so they swear merely in pretence in order to protect themselves.
لَوْ يَجِدُونَ مَلْجَئاً أَوْ مَغَارَاتٍ أَوْ مُدَّخَلاً لَّوَلَّوْاْ إِلَيْهِ وَهُمْ يَجْمَحُونَ,If they could find a shelter in which to seek refuge or some caverns underground chambers or any place to enter they would turn and bolt away to it they would hasten to enter it and get away from you with the undeterred speed of an indomitable steed.
وَمِنْهُمْ مَّن يَلْمِزُكَ فِي ٱلصَّدَقَاتِ فَإِنْ أُعْطُواْ مِنْهَا رَضُواْ وَإِن لَّمْ يُعْطَوْاْ مِنهَا إِذَا هُمْ يَسْخَطُونَ,Some of them defame you concerning the apportioning of voluntary almsgivings; if they are given a share of them they are content but if they are given none then they are enraged.
وَلَوْ أَنَّهُمْ رَضُوْاْ مَآ آتَاهُمُ ٱللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُ وَقَالُواْ حَسْبُنَا ٱللَّهُ سَيُؤْتِينَا ٱللَّهُ مِن فَضْلِهِ وَرَسُولُهُ إِنَّآ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ رَاغِبُونَ,If only they had been content with what God and His Messenger have given them in the way of spoils and the like and had said ‘Sufficient for us is God; God will give us from His bounty and His Messenger will also give us from other spoils what will suffice us; to God we are suppliants’ that He enrich us the response of the conditional law ‘if only’ is la-kāna khayran lahum ‘it would have been better for them’.
إِنَّمَا ٱلصَّدَقَاتُ لِلْفُقَرَآءِ وَٱلْمَسَاكِينِ وَٱلْعَامِلِينَ عَلَيْهَا وَٱلْمُؤَلَّفَةِ قُلُوبُهُمْ وَفِي ٱلرِّقَابِ وَٱلْغَارِمِينَ وَفِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ وَٱبْنِ ٱلسَّبِيلِ فَرِيضَةً مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ حَكِيمٌ,The voluntary almsgivings the alms to be dispensed are only for the poor who cannot find anything to suffice them in the least and the needy who cannot find anything to suffice them and those who work with them that is with these alms in other words the one who collects them the one who takes the oaths from those who claim them the slave to be manumitted by contract as well as the tax-summoner; and those whose hearts are to be reconciled so that they might become Muslims or that Islam might be firmly established or that their peers might become Muslims or that they might defend Muslims all of whom are classed according to different categories. According to al-Shāfi‘ī may God be pleased with him the first and the last of these categories are no longer given of the alms-tax today because of the established power of Islam; in contrast the other two categories are given of the alms-tax according to the sounder opinion; and for the manumission of slaves that is for slaves to be manumitted by contract and for the debtors those in debt if they have taken out a debt without intending thereby an act of disobedience or those who have repented but have nothing with which to fulfil the penalty of expiation or to set things right between people even if they be wealthy; and for the way of God that is for those who are engaged in the struggle of those for whom there is no share of the booty fay’ even if they be wealthy; and for the traveller the one cut off from resources during his journey — a duty imposed by God farīdatan ‘a duty’ is in the accusative because of an implied verb sc. faradahā ‘which He has imposed’. And God is Knower of His creatures Wise in His actions. Thus it is impermissible to dispense these alms-proceeds other than to these categories or to deny these proceeds to any one of these categories if they exist. The Imam must divide these proceeds among them equally but he is permitted to give priority to certain individuals over others within any one category. The lām of li’l-fuqarā’ ‘for the poor’ indicates that it is obligatory to include every individual of these categories in the distribution of the proceeds; it is not however obligatory to do so when the person in charge of the monies has to apportion it but finds that it is insufficient. Indeed in such a situation it suffices to give three individuals from each category but anything less than that is not sufficient as is indicated by the plural form. The Sunna shows that the prerequisite condition for receiving a share of such monies is that the person be a Muslim but not a Hashimī or a Muttālibī.
وَمِنْهُمُ ٱلَّذِينَ يُؤْذُونَ ٱلنَّبِيَّ وَيِقُولُونَ هُوَ أُذُنٌ قُلْ أُذُنُ خَيْرٍ لَّكُمْ يُؤْمِنُ بِٱللَّهِ وَيُؤْمِنُ لِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَرَحْمَةٌ لِّلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ مِنكُمْ وَٱلَّذِينَ يُؤْذُونَ رَسُولَ ٱللَّهِ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,And of them the hypocrites are those who injure the Prophet by casting aspersions on him and communicating to others what he says in confidence saying when they are forbidden from doing this lest it should reach him ‘He is only a listener!’ that is he listens to anything that is said and accepts it so that when we swear to him that we have not communicated to others a particular thing he believes us. Say he is ‘A listener who listens to good for you and not one who listens to evil one who believes in God and has faith he trusts in the believers in what they inform him and not in others the lām of li’l-mu’minīna ‘in the believers’ has been added to distinguish between belief in the sense of ‘submitting to God’ islām and in other senses such as ‘trusting’ and who is a mercy read rahmatun in the nominative as a supplement to udhunun ‘a listener’ or rahmatin in the genitive as a supplement to khayrin ‘to good’ to those of you who believe. Those who injure God’s Messenger for them there is a painful chastisement’.
يَحْلِفُونَ بِٱللَّهِ لَكُمْ لِيُرْضُوكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُ أَحَقُّ أَن يُرْضُوهُ إِن كَانُواْ مُؤْمِنِينَ,They swear by God to you O believers that what has reached you of the Messenger being injured they did not do so that they might please you but God and His Messenger are more deserving that they should please them through obedience if they are true believers the merging of the pronouns into one in yurdūhu ‘their pleasing them’ is because the ‘pleasure’ of both God and His Messenger are mutually dependent; either that or it is because the predicate of Allāhu wa-rasūluhu ‘God and His Messenger’ has been omitted.
أَلَمْ يَعْلَمُوۤاْ أَنَّهُ مَن يُحَادِدِ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ فَأَنَّ لَهُ نَارَ جَهَنَّمَ خَالِداً فِيهَا ذٰلِكَ ٱلْخِزْيُ ٱلْعَظِيمُ,Do they not know that the fact is that whoever opposes God and His Messenger for him shall be the fire of Hell as a requital to abide therein? That is the great abasement.
يَحْذَرُ ٱلْمُنَافِقُونَ أَن تُنَزَّلَ عَلَيْهِمْ سُورَةٌ تُنَبِّئُهُمْ بِمَا فِي قُلُوبِهِم قُلِ ٱسْتَهْزِءُوۤاْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ مُخْرِجٌ مَّا تَحْذَرُونَ,The hypocrites are cautious they fear lest a sūra should be revealed to them that is to the believers informing them of what is in their the hypocrites’ hearts of hypocrisy and yet despite this they persist in mockery. Say ‘Keep mocking! this is an imperative of threat God will bring out He will make manifest that hypocrisy of yours of which you are fearful’ lest it be brought out.
وَلَئِن سَأَلْتَهُمْ لَيَقُولُنَّ إِنَّمَا كُنَّا نَخُوضُ وَنَلْعَبُ قُلْ أَبِٱللَّهِ وَآيَاتِهِ وَرَسُولِهِ كُنتُمْ تَسْتَهْزِءُونَ,And if la-in the lām is for oaths you question them about their mockery of you and of the Qur’ān while they were journeying with you towards Tabūk assuredly they will say making excuses ‘We were only engaging in idle talk and jesting’ in conversation in order to pass the time of the road and we did not mean it. Say to them ‘Were you then mocking God and His signs and His Messenger?
لاَ تَعْتَذِرُواْ قَدْ كَفَرْتُمْ بَعْدَ إِيمَانِكُمْ إِن نَّعْفُ عَن طَآئِفَةٍ مِّنْكُمْ نُعَذِّبْ طَآئِفَةً بِأَنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ مُجْرِمِينَ,Make no excuses for that. You have disbelieved after believing that is your disbelief has become manifest even as you have manifested belief. If We forgive read passive yu‘fa ‘it is forgiven’ or active first person plural na‘fu ‘We forgive’ a party of you because of its sincerity and its repentance as in the case of Jahsh b. Humayyir We will chastise read either passive tu‘adhdhab ‘it shall be chastised’ or nu‘adhdhib another party because they were sinners’ persisting in hypocrisy and mockery.
ٱلْمُنَافِقُونَ وَٱلْمُنَافِقَاتُ بَعْضُهُمْ مِّن بَعْضٍ يَأْمُرُونَ بِٱلْمُنكَرِ وَيَنْهَوْنَ عَنِ ٱلْمَعْرُوفِ وَيَقْبِضُونَ أَيْدِيَهُمْ نَسُواْ ٱللَّهَ فَنَسِيَهُمْ إِنَّ ٱلْمُنَافِقِينَ هُمُ الْفَاسِقُونَ,The hypocrites both men and women are of one another that is they resemble one another in religion as pieces of an individual entity they enjoin indecency unbelief and acts of disobedience and forbid decency faith and obedience; and they withhold their hands shut from expending in obedience of God; they have forgotten God they have abandoned obedience of Him so He has forgotten them He has deprived them of His grace. Truly the hypocrites they are the wicked.
وَعَدَ الله الْمُنَافِقِينَ وَٱلْمُنَافِقَاتِ وَٱلْكُفَّارَ نَارَ جَهَنَّمَ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا هِيَ حَسْبُهُمْ وَلَعَنَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ مُّقِيمٌ,God has promised the hypocrites both men and women and the disbelievers the fire of Hell to abide therein it will suffice them as a requital and a punishment. And God has cursed them He has removed them from His mercy and theirs will be a lasting perpetual chastisement.
كَٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ كَانُواْ أَشَدَّ مِنكُمْ قُوَّةً وَأَكْثَرَ أَمْوَالاً وَأَوْلاَداً فَٱسْتَمْتَعُواْ بِخَلاقِهِمْ فَاسْتَمْتَعْتُمْ بِخَلاَقِكُمْ كَمَا اسْتَمْتَعَ الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ بِخَلاَقِهِمْ وَخُضْتُمْ كَٱلَّذِي خَاضُوۤاْ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ حَبِطَتْ أَعْمَالُهُمْ فِي ٱلدنْيَا وَٱلآخِرَةِ وَأُوْلَئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْخَاسِرُونَ,You O hypocrites are like those before you who were far mightier than you and more abundant in wealth and children. They enjoyed their share their lot in this world. So you enjoy O hypocrites your share just as those before you enjoyed their share and you indulge in vain talk in falsehood and defamation of the Prophet s just as they indulged in vain talk. Those their works have become invalid in this world and in the Hereafter; and those they indeed are the losers.
أَلَمْ يَأْتِهِمْ نَبَأُ ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ قَوْمِ نُوحٍ وَعَادٍ وَثَمُودَ وَقَوْمِ إِبْرَٰهِيمَ وَأَصْحَـٰبِ مَدْيَنَ وَٱلْمُؤْتَفِكَـٰتِ أَتَتْهُمْ رُسُلُهُمْ بِٱلْبَيِّنَـٰتِ فَمَا كَانَ ٱللَّهُ لِيَظْلِمَهُمْ وَلَـٰكِن كَانُوۤاْ أَنْفُسَهُمْ يَظْلِمُونَ,Has not the tidings the tale of those before them reached them — the folk of Noah and ‘Ād the folk of Hūd and Thamūd the folk of Sālih and the folk of Abraham and the dwellers of Midian the folk of Shu‘ayb and the Deviant cities? the cities of the folk of Lot meaning its inhabitants. Their messengers brought them clear proofs with miracles but they denied them and so were destroyed. God would never have wronged them by punishing them for no sin on their part but they wronged themselves by committing sin.
وَٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ وَٱلْمُؤْمِنَاتُ بَعْضُهُمْ أَوْلِيَآءُ بَعْضٍ يَأْمُرُونَ بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ وَيَنْهَوْنَ عَنِ ٱلْمُنْكَرِ وَيُقِيمُونَ ٱلصَّلاَةَ وَيُؤْتُونَ ٱلزَّكَاةَ وَيُطِيعُونَ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ سَيَرْحَمُهُمُ ٱللَّهُ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ,And the believers both men and women are allies of one another; they enjoin decency and forbid indecency; they observe prayer and pay the alms and they obey God and His Messenger. Those God will have mercy on them. Truly God is Mighty nothing can prevent Him from fulfilling His promise and His threat; Wise He puts everything in its proper place.
وَعَدَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَٱلْمُؤْمِنَاتِ جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلأَنْهَارُ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا وَمَسَاكِنَ طَيِّبَةً فِي جَنَّاتِ عَدْنٍ وَرِضْوَانٌ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ أَكْبَرُ ذٰلِكَ هُوَ ٱلْفَوْزُ ٱلْعَظِيمُ,God has promised the believers both men and women Gardens underneath which rivers flow to abide therein and blessed dwellings in the Gardens of Eden for residence and beatitude from God is greater is superior to all of that. That is the supreme triumph.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّبِيُّ جَاهِدِ ٱلْكُفَّارَ وَٱلْمُنَافِقِينَ وَٱغْلُظْ عَلَيْهِمْ وَمَأْوَاهُمْ جَهَنَّمُ وَبِئْسَ ٱلْمَصِيرُ,O Prophet struggle against the disbelievers with the sword and the hypocrites with words and definitive arguments and be harsh with them through rebuke and aversion towards them; for their abode will be Hell an evil journey’s end an evil resort it is!
يَحْلِفُونَ بِٱللَّهِ مَا قَالُواْ وَلَقَدْ قَالُواْ كَلِمَةَ ٱلْكُفْرِ وَكَفَرُواْ بَعْدَ إِسْلاَمِهِمْ وَهَمُّواْ بِمَا لَمْ يَنَالُواْ وَمَا نَقَمُوۤاْ إِلاَّ أَنْ أَغْنَاهُمُ ٱللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُ مِن فَضْلِهِ فَإِن يَتُوبُواْ يَكُ خَيْراً لَّهُمْ وَإِن يَتَوَلَّوْا يُعَذِّبْهُمُ ٱللَّهُ عَذَاباً أَلِيماً فِي ٱلدُّنْيَا وَٱلآخِرَةِ وَمَا لَهُمْ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ مِن وَلِيٍّ وَلاَ نَصِيرٍ,They the hypocrites swear by God that they said nothing of the defamation that has reached you as being from them; but they did indeed say the word of disbelief and did disbelieve after their submission to God they did indeed manifest disbelief after having manifested submission to God. And they purposed that which they never attained in the way of assassinating the Prophet on the night of al-‘Aqaba upon his return from Tabūk — there were about ten to twenty of them and ‘Ammār b. Yāsir struck the faces of their riding camels when they came against him and were thus repulsed; and they were only spiteful they detested that God and His Messenger should have enriched them of His bounty by way of spoils when they had been in dire need the meaning is that this was all that they attained from him which is nothing to be spiteful about. So if they repent of hypocrisy and believe in you it will be better for them; but if they turn away from belief God will chastise them with a painful chastisement in this world by having them killed and in the Hereafter in the Fire and they have none on earth as protector to guard them from Him or helper to defend them.
وَمِنْهُمْ مَّنْ عَاهَدَ ٱللَّهَ لَئِنْ آتَانَا مِن فَضْلِهِ لَنَصَّدَّقَنَّ وَلَنَكُونَنَّ مِنَ ٱلصَّالِحِينَ,And some of them have made a covenant with God saying ‘If He gives us of His bounty we will give voluntary alms la-nassaddaqanna the original tā’ of natasaddaqanna has been assimilated with the sād and become of the righteous’ this was Tha‘laba b. Hātib who asked the Prophet s to supplicate on his behalf so that God would give him wealth of which he would give every needy person his due. He the Prophet thus supplicated for him and he became wealthy but stopped attending the Friday prayer and congregational prayers and refused to pay the alms-tax as God exalted be He says
فَلَمَّآ آتَاهُمْ مِّن فَضْلِهِ بَخِلُواْ بِهِ وَتَوَلَّواْ وَّهُمْ مُّعْرِضُونَ,Yet when He gave them of His bounty they became niggardly with it and turned away from obedience to God in aversion.
فَأَعْقَبَهُمْ نِفَاقاً فِي قُلُوبِهِمْ إِلَىٰ يَوْمِ يَلْقَوْنَهُ بِمَآ أَخْلَفُواْ ٱللَّهَ مَا وَعَدُوهُ وَبِمَا كَانُواْ يَكْذِبُونَ,So He made the consequence in their case hypocrisy fixed in their hearts until the day they meet Him that is God on the Day of Resurrection because they failed God in what they promised Him and because of that concerning which they lied he Tha‘laba then brought the payment of his alms to the Prophet s who said to him ‘God has forbidden me to accept it from you’; so he Tha‘laba began to throw earth on his head in remorse. He then approached Abū Bakr with it who did not accept it. He then went to ‘Umar b. al-Khattāb who also did not accept it. He went to ‘Uthmān b. ‘Affān but he did not accept it; he died during the latter’s reign.
أَلَمْ يَعْلَمُواْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَعْلَمُ سِرَّهُمْ وَنَجْوَاهُمْ وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلاَّمُ ٱلْغُيُوبِ,Did they the hypocrites not know that God knows their secret what they conceal within themselves and their confidential talks what they confide in each other and that God is the Knower of the hidden things? what is concealed from the eyes.
ٱلَّذِينَ يَلْمِزُونَ ٱلْمُطَّوِّعِينَ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ فِي الصَّدَقَاتِ وَالَّذِينَ لاَ يَجِدُونَ إِلاَّ جُهْدَهُمْ فَيَسْخَرُونَ مِنْهُمْ سَخِرَ ٱللَّهُ مِنْهُمْ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,When the verse concerning ‘voluntary alms’ Q. 975 was revealed a man came and gave a large amount as voluntary alms so the hypocrites said ‘He is merely showing off!’ Another man then came and gave a moderate measure of food and so they said ‘God has no need of this man’s charity!’ The following was then revealed Those who alladhīna is the subject find fault with defame the believers who offer alms voluntarily performing supererogation and such as find nothing to offer but their endeavours nothing but what they are capable of and offer it; and deride them and the predicate of the mentioned subject is the following — God Himself derides them He has requited them for their derision and theirs will be a painful chastisement.
ٱسْتَغْفِرْ لَهُمْ أَوْ لاَ تَسْتَغْفِرْ لَهُمْ إِن تَسْتَغْفِرْ لَهُمْ سَبْعِينَ مَرَّةً فَلَن يَغْفِرَ ٱللَّهُ لَهُمْ ذٰلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ كَفَرُواْ بِٱللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ وَٱللَّهُ لاَ يَهْدِي ٱلْقَوْمَ ٱلْفَاسِقِينَ,Ask forgiveness for them O Muhammad (s) or do not ask forgiveness for them this leaves the choice of asking forgiveness or refraining up to him; the Prophet s said ‘I have been given the choice and I made it’ meaning the choice to ask forgiveness as reported by al-Bukhārī. If you ask forgiveness for them seventy times God will not forgive them it is said that the ‘seventy’ is intended to express by hyperbole a great frequency of asking forgiveness. In the Sahīh of al-Bukhārī there is a hadīth which states ‘If I was sure that were I to ask more than seventy times God would forgive them I would have done so’. It is also said however that the very number seventy is actually meant on account of this other hadīth of his ‘I shall ask more than seventy times’ whereupon it was made clear to him the Prophet that the matter regarding forgiveness had been concluded by the verse Q. 636 Alike it will be regarding them whether you ask forgiveness for them or you do not ask forgiveness for them God will not forgive them; that is because they disbelieved in God and His Messenger; and God does not guide the wicked folk.
فَرِحَ ٱلْمُخَلَّفُونَ بِمَقْعَدِهِمْ خِلاَفَ رَسُولِ ٱللَّهِ وَكَرِهُوۤاْ أَن يُجَاهِدُواْ بِأَمْوَالِهِمْ وَأَنْفُسِهِمْ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ وَقَالُواْ لاَ تَنفِرُواْ فِي ٱلْحَرِّ قُلْ نَارُ جَهَنَّمَ أَشَدُّ حَرّاً لَّوْ كَانُوا يَفْقَهُونَ,Those who were left behind from the journey to Tabūk rejoiced at remaining behind the Messenger of God and were averse to striving with their wealth and their lives in the way of God. And they said that is they said to one another ‘Do not go forth do not set off to join the fight in the heat!’ Say ‘The fire of Hell is hotter than Tabūk and more worthy for them to guard against by not staying behind did they but understand’ this they would not have stayed behind.
فَلْيَضْحَكُواْ قَلِيلاً وَلْيَبْكُواْ كَثِيراً جَزَآءً بِمَا كَانُواْ يَكْسِبُونَ,But let them laugh a little in this world and weep much in the Hereafter as a requital for what they used to earn the sentence is predicative of their state expressed in the form of an imperative.
فَإِن رَّجَعَكَ ٱللَّهُ إِلَىٰ طَآئِفَةٍ مِّنْهُمْ فَٱسْتَأْذَنُوكَ لِلْخُرُوجِ فَقُلْ لَّن تَخْرُجُواْ مَعِيَ أَبَداً وَلَن تُقَاتِلُواْ مَعِيَ عَدُوّاً إِنَّكُمْ رَضِيتُمْ بِٱلْقُعُودِ أَوَّلَ مَرَّةٍ فَٱقْعُدُواْ مَعَ ٱلْخَالِفِينَ,So if God brings you back from Tabūk to a party of them of those hypocrites who stayed behind in Medina and they ask leave of you to go forth with you on some other campaign say to them ‘You shall never more go forth with me and you shall never fight with me against an enemy. You were content to stay behind the first time so stay behind with those who stay behind’ away from military campaigns such as women and children and others.
وَلاَ تُصَلِّ عَلَىٰ أَحَدٍ مِّنْهُم مَّاتَ أَبَداً وَلاَ تَقُمْ عَلَىٰ قَبْرِهِ إِنَّهُمْ كَفَرُواْ بِٱللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ وَمَاتُواْ وَهُمْ فَاسِقُونَ,When the Prophet s prayed over the dead body of ‘Abd Allāh Ibn Ubayy the following was revealed And never pray over any one of them when he is dead nor stand over his grave at a burial or as a visit; lo! they disbelieved in God and His Messenger and died while they were wicked they died disbelieving.
وَلاَ تُعْجِبْكَ أَمْوَٰلُهُمْ وَأَوْلَـٰدُهُمْ إِنَّمَا يُرِيدُ ٱللَّهُ أَن يُعَذِّبَهُمْ بِهَا فِي ٱلدُّنْيَا وَتَزْهَقَ أَنفُسُهُمْ وَهُمْ كَٰفِرُونَ,And let not their wealth and their children please you; God desires only to chastise them thereby in this world and that their souls should depart while they are disbelievers.
وَإِذَآ أُنزِلَتْ سُورَةٌ أَنْ آمِنُواْ بِٱللَّهِ وَجَاهِدُواْ مَعَ رَسُولِهِ ٱسْتَأْذَنَكَ أُوْلُواْ ٱلطَّوْلِ مِنْهُمْ وَقَالُواْ ذَرْنَا نَكُنْ مَّعَ ٱلْقَاعِدِينَ,And when a sūra that is a section of the Qur’ān is revealed saying ‘Believe in God and strive with His Messenger’ the affluent among them ask leave of you saying ‘Leave us to be with those who sit at home’.
رَضُواْ بِأَن يَكُونُواْ مَعَ ٱلْخَوَالِفِ وَطُبِعَ عَلَىٰ قُلُوبِهِمْ فَهُمْ لاَ يَفْقَهُونَ,They are content to be with those who stay behind khawālif is the plural of khālifa meaning the women who ‘stay behind’ takhallafna at home and a seal has been set upon their hearts so they do not understand what is good.
لَـٰكِنِ ٱلرَّسُولُ وَٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ مَعَهُ جَاهَدُواْ بِأَمْوَالِهِمْ وَأَنْفُسِهِمْ وَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ لَهُمُ ٱلْخَيْرَاتُ وَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْمُفْلِحُونَ,But the Messenger and those who believe with him strive with their wealth and their lives for them are the good things in this life and in the Hereafter; those they are the successful the triumphant.
أَعَدَّ ٱللَّهُ لَهُمْ جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلأَنْهَارُ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا ذٰلِكَ ٱلْفَوْزُ ٱلْعَظِيمُ,God has prepared for them Gardens underneath which rivers flow to abide therein that is the supreme triumph.
وَجَآءَ ٱلْمُعَذِّرُونَ مِنَ ٱلأَعْرَابِ لِيُؤْذَنَ لَهُمْ وَقَعَدَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَذَبُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ سَيُصِيبُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِنْهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,And those Bedouins who had an excuse al-mu‘adhdhirūn the original tā’ has been assimilated with the dāl in other words it would usually be read as al-mu‘tadhirūn which itself is a variant reading those of them who were excused came to the Prophet s asking for leave to stay behind on account of their excuses and so he gave them leave to do so. And those who lied to God and His Messenger by feigning belief those hypocrites among the Bedouin stayed behind refraining from coming to give their excuses — a painful chastisement shall befall those of them who disbelieve.
لَّيْسَ عَلَى ٱلضُّعَفَآءِ وَلاَ عَلَىٰ ٱلْمَرْضَىٰ وَلاَ عَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ لاَ يَجِدُونَ مَا يُنفِقُونَ حَرَجٌ إِذَا نَصَحُواْ لِلَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ مَا عَلَى ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ مِن سَبِيلٍ وَٱللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,As for the weak such as the old and the sick the blind and the chronically ill and those who find nothing to expend for the struggle no blame no sin falls upon them should they stay away from it if they remain true to God and to His Messenger when they stay behind by not spreading false rumours or impeding others from joining the struggle but by adhering to obedience. There is no way of blame no way of reproach against those who are virtuous through such behaviour. And God is Forgiving Merciful to them by granting them such leeway in this matter.
وَلاَ عَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ إِذَا مَآ أَتَوْكَ لِتَحْمِلَهُمْ قُلْتَ لاَ أَجِدُ مَآ أَحْمِلُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ تَوَلَّوْا وَّأَعْيُنُهُمْ تَفِيضُ مِنَ ٱلدَّمْعِ حَزَناً أَلاَّ يَجِدُواْ مَا يُنْفِقُونَ,Nor against those who when they came to you so that you might give them a mount to ride with you on the raid — these were seven men of the Ansār; but it is also said that they were the Banū Muqrin — you having said to them ‘I cannot find a mount whereon to mount you’ this last sentence is a circumstantial qualifier turned back this is the response to the clause beginning with idhā ‘when’ that is they departed their eyes flowing pouring with tears min al-dam‘i min is explicative for sorrow that they could not find the means to expend for the campaign struggle.
إِنَّمَا ٱلسَّبِيلُ عَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ يَسْتَأْذِنُونَكَ وَهُمْ أَغْنِيَآءُ رَضُواْ بِأَن يَكُونُواْ مَعَ ٱلْخَوَالِفِ وَطَبَعَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ قُلُوبِهِمْ فَهُمْ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ,The way of blame is only against those who ask leave of you to stay behind when they are rich. They are content to be with those who stay behind and God has set a seal on their hearts so that they do not know a similar statement has already been made.
يَعْتَذِرُونَ إِلَيْكُمْ إِذَا رَجَعْتُمْ إِلَيْهِمْ قُل لاَّ تَعْتَذِرُواْ لَن نُّؤْمِنَ لَكُمْ قَدْ نَبَّأَنَا ٱللَّهُ مِنْ أَخْبَارِكُمْ وَسَيَرَى ٱللَّهُ عَمَلَكُمْ وَرَسُولُهُ ثُمَّ تُرَدُّونَ إِلَىٰ عَالِمِ ٱلْغَيْبِ وَٱلشَّهَادَةِ فَيُنَبِّئُكُم بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ,They will make excuses to you for having stayed behind when you return to them from the campaign. Say to them ‘Do not make excuses; we will never believe you! God has already told us tidings of you that is He has already informed us of your true status. And God will see your work and so will His Messenger then you will be returned through resurrection to the Knower of the unseen and the visible meaning to God and He will tell you what you used to do’ and requite you for it.
سَيَحْلِفُونَ بِٱللَّهِ لَكُمْ إِذَا ٱنْقَلَبْتُمْ إِلَيْهِمْ لِتُعْرِضُواْ عَنْهُمْ فَأَعْرِضُواْ عَنْهُمْ إِنَّهُمْ رِجْسٌ وَمَأْوَاهُمْ جَهَنَّمُ جَزَآءً بِمَا كَانُواْ يَكْسِبُونَ,They will swear to you by God when you turn back when you return to them from Tabūk that they had genuine excuses for staying behind so that you may leave them be refraining from reproaching them. So leave them be for they are an abomination filth on account of their inner vileness and their abode shall be Hell as requital for what they used to earn.
يَحْلِفُونَ لَكُمْ لِتَرْضَوْاْ عَنْهُمْ فَإِن تَرْضَوْاْ عَنْهُمْ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لاَ يَرْضَىٰ عَنِ ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلْفَاسِقِينَ,They will swear to you that you may be satisfied with them; but if you are satisfied with them God will surely not be satisfied with the wicked folk that is with them your satisfaction is of no avail in the face of the wrath of God.
ٱلأَعْرَابُ أَشَدُّ كُفْراً وَنِفَاقاً وَأَجْدَرُ أَلاَّ يَعْلَمُواْ حُدُودَ مَآ أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ رَسُولِهِ وَٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ حَكِيمٌ,The Bedouins the Arab nomads are more intense in unbelief and hypocrisy than the city-dwellers on account of their harshness and crude nature and their being too remote to hear the Qur’ān and are more likely not to know the bounds of what God has revealed to His Messenger in the way of rulings and legal prescriptions; and God is Knower of His creatures Wise in what He does with them.
وَمِنَ ٱلأَعْرَابِ مَن يَتَّخِذُ مَا يُنفِقُ مَغْرَماً وَيَتَرَبَّصُ بِكُمُ ٱلدَّوَائِرَ عَلَيْهِمْ دَآئِرَةُ ٱلسَّوْءِ وَٱللَّهُ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ,And of the Bedouins there is he who takes what he expends in the way of God as a penalty as a liability and a financial loss because he does not aspire to be rewarded for it but expends it out of fear these were Banū Asad and Banū Ghatafān; and awaits for you evil turns of fortune the fortunes of time for you that these should turn against you and so be rid of you. Theirs shall be the evil read as al-sū‘ or al-saw‘ turn of fortune that is chastisement and destruction shall turn on them not on you. And God is Hearer of the sayings of His servants Knower of their actions.
وَمِنَ ٱلأَعْرَابِ مَن يُؤْمِنُ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلآخِرِ وَيَتَّخِذُ مَا يُنفِقُ قُرُبَاتٍ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ وَصَلَوَاتِ ٱلرَّسُولِ أَلاۤ إِنَّهَا قُرْبَةٌ لَّهُمْ سَيُدْخِلُهُمُ ٱللَّهُ فِي رَحْمَتِهِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,And of the Bedouins there is he who believes in God and the Last Day such as men from among the tribes of Juhayna and Muzayna and takes what he expends in the way of God as pious offerings to bring him nearer to God and as a means to secure the prayers the supplications of the Messenger for him. Surely these the expenditure of such men will bring them nearer read qurubatun or qurbatun to Him. God will admit them into His mercy His Paradise. Truly God is Forgiving to those who obey Him Merciful to them.
وَٱلسَّابِقُونَ ٱلأَوَّلُونَ مِنَ ٱلْمُهَاجِرِينَ وَٱلأَنْصَارِ وَٱلَّذِينَ ٱتَّبَعُوهُم بِإِحْسَانٍ رَّضِيَ ٱللَّهُ عَنْهُمْ وَرَضُواْ عَنْهُ وَأَعَدَّ لَهُمْ جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي تَحْتَهَا ٱلأَنْهَارُ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَآ أَبَداً ذٰلِكَ ٱلْفَوْزُ ٱلْعَظِيمُ,And the first to lead the way of the Emigrants and the Helpers namely those who were present at the battle of Badr or it means all the Companions and those who follow them up to the Day of Resurrection by being virtuous in deeds God will be pleased with them for their obedience of Him and they will be pleased with Him for His reward to them; and He has prepared for them Gardens — with rivers flowing beneath them a variant reading adds min min tahtihā ‘beneath which’ — to abide therein forever that is the supreme triumph.
وَمِمَّنْ حَوْلَكُمْ مِّنَ ٱلأَعْرَابِ مُنَٰفِقُونَ وَمِنْ أَهْلِ ٱلْمَدِينَةِ مَرَدُواْ عَلَى ٱلنِّفَاقِ لاَ تَعْلَمُهُمْ نَحْنُ نَعْلَمُهُمْ سَنُعَذِّبُهُم مَّرَّتَيْنِ ثُمَّ يُرَدُّونَ إِلَىٰ عَذَابٍ عَظِيمٍ,And among those around you O inhabitants of Medina of the Bedouins there are hypocrites such as the tribes of Aslam Ashja‘ and Ghifār and among the townspeople of Medina there are also hypocrites who are obstinate in hypocrisy engrossed in it and persisting in it. You do not know them — an address to the Prophet s — but We know them and We shall chastise them twice by disgracing them or having them killed in this world and by way of punishment in the grave then they will be returned in the Hereafter to a terrible chastisement namely the Fire.
وَآخَرُونَ ٱعْتَرَفُواْ بِذُنُوبِهِمْ خَلَطُواْ عَمَلاً صَالِحاً وَآخَرَ سَيِّئاً عَسَى ٱللَّهُ أَن يَتُوبَ عَلَيْهِمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,And there are others ākharūn is the subject another folk who have confessed their sins for having stayed behind i‘tarafū bi-dhunūbihim is an adjectival qualification of it the subject and the predicate is the following khalatū ‘amalan sālihan they have mixed a righteous deed that is their former participation in the struggle or the their confession of their sins or otherwise with another that was bad which is their having stayed behind. It may be that God will relent to them. Truly God is Forgiving Merciful this was revealed regarding Abū Lubāba and a group of men who tied themselves to the walls of the mosque after they heard what had been revealed regarding those who stayed behind; they swore that only the Prophet s would untie them which he did when this verse was revealed.
خُذْ مِنْ أَمْوَالِهِمْ صَدَقَةً تُطَهِّرُهُمْ وَتُزَكِّيهِمْ بِهَا وَصَلِّ عَلَيْهِمْ إِنَّ صَلَٰوتَك سَكَنٌ لَّهُمْ وَٱللَّهُ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ,Take of their wealth some alms to purify them and to cleanse them thereby of their sins; he thus took a third of their wealth and gave it away as charity; and pray for them that is supplicate for them; truly your prayers are a comfort a mercy for them it is also said to mean reassurance for them that their repentance has been accepted. And God is Hearer Knower.
أَلَمْ يَعْلَمُوۤاْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ هُوَ يَقْبَلُ ٱلتَّوْبَةَ عَنْ عِبَادِهِ وَيَأْخُذُ ٱلصَّدَقَاتِ وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ هُوَ ٱلتَّوَّابُ ٱلرَّحِيمُ,Do they not know that God is He Who accepts repentance from His servants and takes accepts the voluntary alms and that God is He Who is the Relenting to His servants by accepting their repentance and the Merciful? to them the interrogative is intended as an affirmative statement and is meant to incite them to offer repentance and charity.
وَقُلِ ٱعْمَلُواْ فَسَيَرَى ٱللَّهُ عَمَلَكُمْ وَرَسُولُهُ وَٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ وَسَتُرَدُّونَ إِلَىٰ عَالِمِ ٱلْغَيْبِ وَٱلشَّهَادَةِ فَيُنَبِّئُكُمْ بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ,And say to them or to people in general ‘Act as you will for God will surely see your actions and so will His Messenger and the believers and you will be returned through resurrection to the Knower of the unseen and the visible that is to God and He will tell you what you used to do’ and so requite you for it.
وَآخَرُونَ مُرْجَوْنَ لأَمْرِ ٱللَّهِ إِمَّا يُعَذِّبُهُمْ وَإِمَّا يَتُوبُ عَلَيْهِمْ وَٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ حَكِيمٌ,And there are others from among those who stayed behind who are deferred read murja’ūna or murjawna whose repentance is delayed to God’s command concerning them according to His will whether He chastises them by causing them to die without their having made any repentance or relents to them; and God is Knower of His creatures Wise in what He does with them. These others mentioned are the three who will be mentioned afterwards Murāra b. al-Rabī‘ Ka‘b b. Mālik and Hilāl b. Umayya. They stayed behind out of laziness and their inclination for peace and quiet not out of hypocrisy. Unlike the others however they did not excuse themselves before the Prophet s and so the matter regarding them was suspended for fifty days during which time people avoided them until it was later revealed that God had relented to them.
وَٱلَّذِينَ ٱتَّخَذُواْ مَسْجِداً ضِرَاراً وَكُفْراً وَتَفْرِيقاً بَيْنَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَإِرْصَاداً لِّمَنْ حَارَبَ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ مِن قَبْلُ وَلَيَحْلِفُنَّ إِنْ أَرَدْنَا إِلاَّ ٱلْحُسْنَىٰ وَٱللَّهُ يَشْهَدُ إِنَّهُمْ لَكَاذِبُونَ,And among them those who have chosen a mosque — these were twelve men from among the hypocrites — by way of harm to cause distress for those of the mosque of Qubā’ and disbelief since they built it on the orders of the monk Abū ‘Āmir as a sanctuary for him so that whoever comes from his side may stay there he had gone to the Byzantine Emperor qaysar to bring troops to fight against the Prophet s and to cause division among the believers who pray in the mosque of Qubā’ by having some of these pray in their the hypocrites’ mosque and as an outpost an observation post for those who waged war against God and His Messenger before that is before it was built — meaning the above-mentioned Abū ‘Āmir — they will swear ‘We desired nothing by building it but to do good’ by way of kindness towards the poor in times of heavy rain or extreme heat and in order to provide a place of worship for the Muslims; and God bears witness that they are truly liars in this claim of theirs. They had asked the Prophet s to perform prayers in it and so the following was revealed
لاَ تَقُمْ فِيهِ أَبَداً لَّمَسْجِدٌ أُسِّسَ عَلَى ٱلتَّقْوَىٰ مِنْ أَوَّلِ يَوْمٍ أَحَقُّ أَن تَقُومَ فِيهِ فِيهِ رِجَالٌ يُحِبُّونَ أَن يَتَطَهَّرُواْ وَٱللَّهُ يُحِبُّ ٱلْمُطَّهِّرِينَ,Never stand never perform prayer there and so he sent a group of men to destroy and burn it and in its place they left a refuse pit where decaying cadavers would be dumped. A mosque which was founded one whose foundations were built upon piety from the first day constructed the day you arrived in Medina dār al-hijra — this was the mosque of Qubā’ as mentioned in Bukhārī — is worthier than that other one for you to stand to perform prayer therein; in it are men namely the Ansār who love to purify themselves; and God loves those who purify themselves muttahhirīn the original tā’ of mutatahhirūn has been assimilated with the tā’ that is He will reward them. Ibn Khuzayma reported in his Sahīh by way of an isnād from ‘Uwaym b. Sā‘ida that ‘The Prophet s came to them at the mosque of Qubā’ and said “God exalted be He has praised handsomely the way you purify yourselves in the story about your mosque so what is this purification which you perform?” They said “By God O Messenger of God all that we know is that we used to have Jews in our vicinity and they used to wash their behinds after defecation and so we began to wash in the way they did”’. According to one hadīth reported by al-Bazzār they said ‘We use stones to scrape off remnants and follow this with water’; to which he the Prophet said ‘That is the way for proper purification. Let this be your way’.
أَفَمَنْ أَسَّسَ بُنْيَانَهُ عَلَىٰ تَقْوَىٰ مِنَ اللَّهِ وَرِضْوَانٍ خَيْرٌ أَم مَّنْ أَسَّسَ بُنْيَانَهُ عَلَىٰ شَفَا جُرُفٍ هَارٍ فَٱنْهَارَ بِهِ فِي نَارِ جَهَنَّمَ وَٱللَّهُ لاَ يَهْدِي ٱلْقَوْمَ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ,Is he who founded his building upon fear of God and in hope of beatitude from Him better or he who founded his building upon the brink the edge of a bank an overhang that is crumbling about to collapse read juruf or jurf so that it toppled with him so that it collapsed taking with it the one who built it into the fire of Hell? this is an excellent similitude for building upon that which constitutes the opposite of fear of God and for what it leads to; the interrogative is meant as an affirmative in other words the former is the better which is the likeness of the building of the mosque of Qubā’ while the latter is the likeness of the mosque of ‘harm’ masjid al-dirār. And God guides not the evildoing folk.
لاَ يَزَالُ بُنْيَانُهُمُ ٱلَّذِي بَنَوْاْ رِيبَةً فِي قُلُوبِهِمْ إِلاَّ أَن تَقَطَّعَ قُلُوبُهُمْ وَٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ حَكِيمٌ,The buildings which they have built will never cease to be a misgiving a point of doubt in their hearts unless their hearts are cut torn to pieces such that they die; and God is Knower of His creatures Wise in what He does with them.
إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ ٱشْتَرَىٰ مِنَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ أَنفُسَهُمْ وَأَمْوَالَهُمْ بِأَنَّ لَهُمُ ٱلْجَنَّةَ يُقَاتِلُونَ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ فَيَقْتُلُونَ وَيُقْتَلُونَ وَعْداً عَلَيْهِ حَقّاً فِي ٱلتَّوْرَاةِ وَٱلإِنْجِيلِ وَٱلْقُرْآنِ وَمَنْ أَوْفَىٰ بِعَهْدِهِ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ فَٱسْتَبْشِرُواْ بِبَيْعِكُمُ ٱلَّذِي بَايَعْتُمْ بِهِ وَذَلِكَ هُوَ ٱلْفَوْزُ ٱلْعَظِيمُ,Indeed God has purchased from the believers their lives and their possessions that they expend it in obedience of Him — for example by striving in His way — so that theirs will be the reward of Paradise they shall fight in the way of God and they shall kill and be killed this sentence is independent and constitutes an explication of the above-mentioned ‘purchase’; a variant reading has the passive verb come first sc. fa-yuqtalūna wa-yaqtulūn ‘they shall be killed and shall kill’ meaning that some of them are killed while those who remain fight on; that is a promise which is binding both wa‘dan ‘promise’ and haqqan ‘binding’ are verbal nouns and are in the accusative on account of their omitted implicit verbs upon Him in the Torah and the Gospel and the Qur’ān; and who fulfils his covenant better than God? that is no one is better in fulfilling it. Rejoice then there is a shift from the third to second person here in this bargain of yours which you have made for that bargain is the supreme triumph the one that secures the ultimate goal.
ٱلتَّائِبُونَ ٱلْعَابِدُونَ ٱلْحَامِدُونَ ٱلسَّائِحُونَ ٱلرَّاكِعُونَ ٱلسَّاجِدونَ ٱلآمِرُونَ بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ وَٱلنَّاهُونَ عَنِ ٱلْمُنكَرِ وَٱلْحَافِظُونَ لِحُدُودِ ٱللَّهِ وَبَشِّرِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,Those who repent al-tā’ibūna is in the nominative as a laudative the subject being implicit from idolatry and hypocrisy those who worship who devote their worship sincerely to God those who give praise to Him in every state those who fast those who bow those who prostrate themselves that is those who perform prayers those who enjoin decency and forbid to indecency those who maintain God’s bounds His rulings by implementing them and give good tidings to the believers of Paradise.
مَا كَانَ لِلنَّبِيِّ وَٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُوۤاْ أَن يَسْتَغْفِرُواْ لِلْمُشْرِكِينَ وَلَوْ كَانُوۤاْ أُوْلِي قُرْبَىٰ مِن بَعْدِ مَا تَبَيَّنَ لَهُمْ أَنَّهُمْ أَصْحَابُ ٱلْجَحِيمِ,The following was revealed regarding the Prophet s asking forgiveness for his uncle Abū Tālib and some of the Companions asking forgiveness for their idolatrous parents It is not for the Prophet and those who believe to ask forgiveness for the idolaters even though they be kinsmen relatives after it has become clear to them that they are inhabitants of the Hell-fire for having died as disbelievers.
وَمَا كَانَ ٱسْتِغْفَارُ إِبْرَاهِيمَ لأَبِيهِ إِلاَّ عَن مَّوْعِدَةٍ وَعَدَهَآ إِيَّاهُ فَلَمَّا تَبَيَّنَ لَهُ أَنَّهُ عَدُوٌّ لِلَّهِ تَبَرَّأَ مِنْهُ إِنَّ إِبْرَاهِيمَ لأَوَّاهٌ حَلِيمٌ,Abraham’s prayer for the forgiveness of his father was only because of a promise he had made to him when he said to him I will ask my Lord forgiveness for you Q. 1947 in the hope that he would submit to God; but when it became clear to him that he was an enemy of God upon his death as an disbeliever he declared himself innocent of him and refrained from asking forgiveness for him; truly Abraham was soft of heart making frequent entreaty and supplication to God forbearing enduring harm patiently.
وَمَا كَانَ ٱللَّهُ لِيُضِلَّ قَوْماً بَعْدَ إِذْ هَدَاهُمْ حَتَّىٰ يُبَيِّنَ لَهُم مَّا يَتَّقُونَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عَلِيمٌ,And God would never send a people astray after He had guided them to Islam until He had made clear to them that which they should be wary of in the way of deeds but when they are not wary of it then they deserve to be sent astray. Surely God is Knower of all things including who deserves to be sent astray or to be guided.
إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَهُ مُلْكُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ يُحْيِـي وَيُمِيتُ وَمَا لَكُمْ مِّن دُونِ اللَّهِ مِن وَلِيٍّ وَلاَ نَصِيرٍ,Surely to God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth. He gives life and He makes to die; and you do not have O mankind besides God that is other than Him any protector to preserve you from Him or helper to defend you against His hurt.
لَقَدْ تَابَ الله عَلَىٰ ٱلنَّبِيِّ وَٱلْمُهَاجِرِينَ وَٱلأَنصَارِ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱتَّبَعُوهُ فِي سَاعَةِ ٱلْعُسْرَةِ مِن بَعْدِ مَا كَادَ يَزِيغُ قُلُوبُ فَرِيقٍ مِّنْهُمْ ثُمَّ تَابَ عَلَيْهِمْ إِنَّهُ بِهِمْ رَءُوفٌ رَّحِيمٌ,God has truly relented that is He has truly perpetuated His relenting to the Prophet and the Emigrants and the Helpers who followed him in the hour of hardship that is during the time of this hardship which was their predicament during the raid at Tabūk where two men would share a single date ten men would take turns on one camel and where the heat became so intense that they resorted to drinking filth; after the hearts of a party of them had almost deviated read either as tazīghu or yazīghu had almost inclined away from following him in favour of staying behind due to the hardship that afflicted them then He relented to them by making them steadfast. Truly He is Gentle Merciful to them.
وَعَلَى ٱلثَّلاَثَةِ ٱلَّذِينَ خُلِّفُواْ حَتَّىٰ إِذَا ضَاقَتْ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلأَرْضُ بِمَا رَحُبَتْ وَضَاقَتْ عَلَيْهِمْ أَنفُسُهُمْ وَظَنُّوۤاْ أَن لاَّ مَلْجَأَ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ إِلاَّ إِلَيْهِ ثُمَّ تَابَ عَلَيْهِمْ لِيَتُوبُوۤاْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ هُوَ ٱلتَّوَّابُ ٱلرَّحِيمُ,And He relented to the three who were left behind formerly denied His relenting to them for the same reason as those mentioned above when the earth was straitened for them for all its breadth that is despite its vastness so they could find no place wherein to feel secure and their souls that is their hearts were straitened for them because of the anxiety and their sense of alienation resulting from the delay of God’s relenting to them with mercy such that they their souls could not find happiness or solace; until they thought they were certain that read the softened an there is no refuge from God except in Him. Then He turned relenting to them He made them successful in finding repentance that they might also turn in repentance. Truly God is the Relenting the Merciful.
يَـٰأيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ ٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَكُونُواْ مَعَ ٱلصَّادِقِينَ,O you who believe fear God by refraining from acts of disobedience to Him and be with those who are truthful in their faith and covenants by adhering to sincerity.
مَا كَانَ لأَهْلِ ٱلْمَدِينَةِ وَمَنْ حَوْلَهُمْ مِّنَ ٱلأَعْرَابِ أَن يَتَخَلَّفُواْ عَن رَّسُولِ ٱللَّهِ وَلاَ يَرْغَبُواْ بِأَنْفُسِهِمْ عَن نَّفْسِهِ ذٰلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ لاَ يُصِيبُهُمْ ظَمَأٌ وَلاَ نَصَبٌ وَلاَ مَخْمَصَةٌ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ وَلاَ يَطَأُونَ مَوْطِئاً يَغِيظُ ٱلْكُفَّارَ وَلاَ يَنَالُونَ مِنْ عَدُوٍّ نَّيْلاً إِلاَّ كُتِبَ لَهُمْ بِهِ عَمَلٌ صَالِحٌ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لاَ يُضِيعُ أَجْرَ ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,It is not for the people of Medina and for the Bedouins who dwell around them to stay behind God’s Messenger when he sets out on a campaign and to prefer their lives to his life by guarding them against hardships which he the Prophet is content to suffer himself this statement is a prohibition expressed as a predicate; that prohibition against staying behind is because neither thirst nor toil nor hunger afflicts them in the way of God nor tread they any tread mawti’an is a verbal noun meaning wat’an that enrages the disbelievers nor gain any gain from the enemy of God be it through slaughter capture or plunder but a righteous deed is therefore recorded for them that they may be rewarded for it. Truly God does not leave the wage of the virtuous to go to waste that is the wage of those mentioned rather He rewards them.
وَلاَ يُنفِقُونَ نَفَقَةً صَغِيرَةً وَلاَ كَبِيرَةً وَلاَ يَقْطَعُونَ وَادِياً إِلاَّ كُتِبَ لَهُمْ لِيَجْزِيَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ أَحْسَنَ مَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ,Nor expend they therein in the way of God any sum small even if it be a single date or great nor do they cross a valley during a campaign march but it is recorded for them as a righteous deed that God may reward them the best of what they used to do that is the due reward thereof.
وَمَا كَانَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ لِيَنفِرُواْ كَآفَّةً فَلَوْلاَ نَفَرَ مِن كُلِّ فِرْقَةٍ مِّنْهُمْ طَآئِفَةٌ لِّيَتَفَقَّهُواْ فِي ٱلدِّينِ وَلِيُنذِرُواْ قَوْمَهُمْ إِذَا رَجَعُوۤاْ إِلَيْهِمْ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَحْذَرُونَ,When the Prophet s was about to dispatch a raiding party — after they certain Muslims had been reproached for staying behind — all of them went forth and so the following was revealed It is not for the believers to go forth on a raid altogether why should not a party a group of every section of every tribe of them go forth while the others remain behind so that they those who remain behind may become learned in religion and that they may warn their folk when they return to them from the raid by teaching them some of the rulings which they have come to learn so that they may beware? of God’s punishment by adhering to His commands and prohibitions. Ibn ‘Abbās said that this verse is specifically intended for raiding parties while the previous one is specifically to prohibit any individual staying behind when the Prophet s sets out on a campaign.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ قَاتِلُواْ ٱلَّذِينَ يَلُونَكُمْ مِّنَ ٱلْكُفَّارِ وَلْيَجِدُواْ فِيكُمْ غِلْظَةً وَٱعْلَمُوۤاْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ مَعَ ٱلْمُتَّقِينَ,O you who believe fight those of the disbelievers who are near to you that is the nearest followed by the next nearest of them and let them find harshness in you that is severity in other words be harsh with them and know that God is with the pious helping and granting them victory.
وَإِذَا مَآ أُنزِلَتْ سُورَةٌ فَمِنْهُمْ مَّن يَقُولُ أَيُّكُمْ زَادَتْهُ هَـٰذِهِ إِيمَاناً فَأَمَّا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ فَزَادَتْهُمْ إِيمَاناً وَهُمْ يَسْتَبْشِرُونَ,And whenever a sūra of the Qur’ān is revealed there are some of them that is the hypocrites who say to their companions mockingly ‘Which of you has this increased in faith?’ and God says As for those who believe it has increased them in faith because they accept that it is true and they rejoice because of it.
وَأَمَّا ٱلَّذِينَ فِي قُلُوبِهِم مَّرَضٌ فَزَادَتْهُمْ رِجْساً إِلَىٰ رِجْسِهِمْ وَمَاتُواْ وَهُمْ كَافِرُونَ,But as for those in whose hearts is sickness a weakness of faith it only adds abomination to their abomination that is it only adds disbelief to their disbelief since they disbelieve in it and they die while they were disbelievers.
أَوَلاَ يَرَوْنَ أَنَّهُمْ يُفْتَنُونَ فِي كُلِّ عَامٍ مَّرَّةً أَوْ مَرَّتَيْنِ ثُمَّ لاَ يَتُوبُونَ وَلاَ هُمْ يَذَّكَّرُونَ,Do they not see that is the hypocrites in which case read a-wa-lā yarawna; or if read a-wa-lā tarawna ‘do you O believers not see’ that they are tested afflicted every year once or twice? with drought and diseases. Still they do not repent of their hypocrisy nor do they remember nor do they heed admonition.
وَإِذَا مَآ أُنزِلَتْ سُورَةٌ نَّظَرَ بَعْضُهُمْ إِلَىٰ بَعْضٍ هَلْ يَرَاكُمْ مِّنْ أَحَدٍ ثُمَّ ٱنصَرَفُواْ صَرَفَ ٱللَّهُ قُلُوبَهُم بِأَنَّهُمْ قَوْمٌ لاَّ يَفْقَهُونَ,And whenever a sūra is revealed wherein is mention of them and the Prophet s recites it they look at one another desiring to flee and saying ‘Will anyone see you?’ if you get up and flee? and so if no one can see them they get up and leave otherwise they stay put. Then they turn away persisting in their disbelief. God turns their hearts away from guidance because they are a folk who do not understand the truth for they do not reflect on it.
لَقَدْ جَآءَكُمْ رَسُولٌ مِّنْ أَنفُسِكُمْ عَزِيزٌ عَلَيْهِ مَا عَنِتُّمْ حَرِيصٌ عَلَيْكُمْ بِٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ رَءُوفٌ رَّحِيمٌ,Verily there has come to you a messenger from among yourselves that is one of you — Muhammad (s) — for whom it is grievous hard that you should suffer that is your suffering your experiencing hardship and encountering harm is hard on him; who is full of concern for you that you should be rightly guided; to the believers full of pity profoundly compassionate merciful desiring good for them.
فَإِن تَوَلَّوْاْ فَقُلْ حَسْبِيَ ٱللَّهُ لاۤ إِلَـٰهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ عَلَيْهِ تَوَكَّلْتُ وَهُوَ رَبُّ ٱلْعَرْشِ ٱلْعَظِيمِ,So if they turn away refraining from believing in you say ‘God suffices me. There is no god except Him. Upon Him I rely in Him have I put my trust and in none other and He is the Lord of the Tremendous Throne’ al-‘arsh al-azīm the kursī which is singled out for mention because it is the greatest of all things created. Al-Hākim reported in al-Mustadrak by way of an isnād from Ubayy b. Ka‘b that he Ubayy said ‘The last verse to be revealed was from Verily there has come to you a messenger… to the end of the sūra’ sc. Q. 9128-129.
الۤر تِلْكَ آيَاتُ ٱلْكِتَابِ ٱلْحَكِيمِ,Alif lām rā’ God knows best what He means by these letters. Those namely these signs are the signs of the wise Book that is the Qur’ān the genitive annexation āyāt al-kitāb has the meaning of min sc. min āyāti’l-kitāb ‘from among the verses of the Book’ which has been made clear.
أَكَانَ لِلنَّاسِ عَجَباً أَنْ أَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَىٰ رَجُلٍ مِّنْهُمْ أَنْ أَنذِرِ ٱلنَّاسَ وَبَشِّرِ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُوۤاْ أَنَّ لَهُمْ قَدَمَ صِدْقٍ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ قَالَ ٱلْكَافِرُونَ إِنَّ هَـٰذَا لَسَاحِرٌ مُّبِينٌ,Is it for the people the people of Mecca this interrogative is meant as a disavowal; the preposition li- ‘for’ and its dependent genitive noun al-nās ‘the people’ constitute a circumstantial qualifier of His saying a wonder ‘ajaban read in the accusative as a predicate of kāna; or if read in the nominative ‘ajabun as its subject its predicate which is also its subject if read according to the former accusative reading is the following an awhaynā that We have inspired a man from among them Muhammad (s) saying an ‘that’ is explicative ‘Warn threaten the people the disbelievers with chastisement and give good tidings to those who believe that they have a prior a preceding promise of truth with their Lord’? that is a preceding fair reward in return for the deeds they have sent forward. The disbelievers say ‘Truly this Qur’ān that comprises all of that mentioned is manifest sorcery’ a variant reading for la-sihrun has la-sāhirun ‘a sorcerer’ where it is the Prophet s to whom they are referring as being ‘a manifest sorcerer’.
إِنَّ رَبَّكُمُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِي خَلَقَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضَ فِي سِتَّةِ أَيَّامٍ ثُمَّ ٱسْتَوَىٰ عَلَى ٱلْعَرْشِ يُدَبِّرُ ٱلأَمْرَ مَا مِن شَفِيعٍ إِلاَّ مِن بَعْدِ إِذْنِهِ ذٰلِكُمُ ٱللَّهُ رَبُّكُمْ فَٱعْبُدُوهُ أَفَلاَ تَذَكَّرُونَ,Truly your Lord is God Who created the heavens and the earth in six days of the days of this world that is in the same measure of time since there was no sun or moon then had He willed He could have created them in an instant but the reason for His not having done so is that He wanted to teach His creatures to be circumspect; then He presided upon the Throne a presiding befitting of Him directing affairs among creatures. There is no mā min indicates a relative clause intercessor to intercede for anyone save after His permission a refutation of their saying ‘The idols intercede for us!’; that Creator and Director is God your Lord so worship Him affirm His Oneness. Will you not remember? tadhakkarūna the original tā’ of tatadhakkarūna has been assimilated with the dhāl.
إِلَيْهِ مَرْجِعُكُمْ جَمِيعاً وَعْدَ ٱللَّهِ حَقّاً إِنَّهُ يَبْدَؤُاْ ٱلْخَلْقَ ثُمَّ يُعِيدُهُ لِيَجْزِيَ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ بِٱلْقِسْطِ وَٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لَهُمْ شَرَابٌ مِّنْ حَمِيمٍ وَعَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ بِمَا كَانُواْ يَكْفُرُونَ,To Him exalted be He is the return of all of you God’s promise in truth both wa‘da and haqqan are verbal nouns and in the accusative because of the verbs implicit in them. Truly He read innahu as a new sentence or annahu with an implied lām sc. li-annahu ‘Because He’ originates creation that is He began it by originating it then recreates it through resurrection that He may requite reward those who believe and perform righteous deeds justly. And those who disbelieve for them will be a draught of boiling water and a painful chastisement because they disbelieved.
هُوَ ٱلَّذِي جَعَلَ ٱلشَّمْسَ ضِيَآءً وَٱلْقَمَرَ نُوراً وَقَدَّرَهُ مَنَازِلَ لِتَعْلَمُواْ عَدَدَ ٱلسِّنِينَ وَٱلْحِسَابَ مَا خَلَقَ ٱللَّهُ ذٰلِكَ إِلاَّ بِٱلْحَقِّ يُفَصِّلُ ٱلآيَاتِ لِقَوْمٍ يَعْلَمُونَ,He it is Who made the sun a radiance that is emitting light and the moon a light and determined it with respect to its movement in stations 28 stations in 28 nights every month becoming concealed for two nights when a particular month has 30 days or concealed for one night when it has 29 days so that you might know thereby the number of the years and the reckoning. God did not create that which is mentioned save in truth not in vain exalted be He above such things. He details read yufassilu or nufassilu ‘We detail’ the signs for a people who know who reflect.
إِنَّ فِي ٱخْتِلاَفِ ٱلَّيلِ وَٱلنَّهَارِ وَمَا خَلَقَ ٱللَّهُ فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ لآيَاتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يَتَّقُونَ,Truly in the alternation of night and day in their coming and going increasing and diminishing and in what God has created in the heavens of angels sun moon stars and other things and in the earth of animals mountains seas rivers trees and other things there are signs indications of His power exalted be He for a people who fear Him and so believe He singles these out for mention because they are the ones to benefit from them such signs.
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ لاَ يَرْجُونَ لِقَآءَنَا وَرَضُواْ بِٱلْحَيٰوةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَٱطْمَأَنُّواْ بِهَا وَٱلَّذِينَ هُمْ عَنْ آيَاتِنَا غَافِلُونَ,Truly those who do not expect to encounter Us through resurrection and are content with the life of this world instead of the life the Hereafter since they reject the truth of it and feel reassured feel secure in it and those who are heedless of Our signs of the proofs of Our Oneness neglecting to ponder them
أُوْلَـٰئِكَ مَأْوَاهُمُ ٱلنَّارُ بِمَا كَانُواْ يَكْسِبُونَ,those their abode will be the Fire because of what they used to earn in the way of practising idolatry and performing acts of disobedience.
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ يَهْدِيهِمْ رَبُّهُمْ بِإِيمَانِهِمْ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهِمُ ٱلأَنْهَارُ فِي جَنَّاتِ ٱلنَّعِيمِ,Truly those who believe and perform righteous deeds their Lord will guide them He will lead them through their faith in Him by appointing for them a light with which they will be able to find their way on the Day of Resurrection. Rivers will flow beneath them in the Gardens of Bliss
دَعْوَاهُمْ فِيهَا سُبْحَانَكَ ٱللَّهُمَّ وَتَحِيَّتُهُمْ فِيهَا سَلاَمٌ وَآخِرُ دَعْوَاهُمْ أَنِ ٱلْحَمْدُ للَّهِ رَبِّ ٱلْعَالَمِينَ,their prayer therein their request for what they desire in Paradise will be to say ‘Glory be to You O God!’ so that lo! what they request they find before them; and their greeting between them therein will be ‘Peace.’ And their final prayer will be ‘Praise be to God Lord of the Worlds’.
وَلَوْ يُعَجِّلُ ٱللَّهُ لِلنَّاسِ ٱلشَّرَّ ٱسْتِعْجَالَهُمْ بِٱلْخَيْرِ لَقُضِيَ إِلَيْهِمْ أَجَلُهُمْ فَنَذَرُ ٱلَّذِينَ لاَ يَرْجُونَ لِقَآءَنَا فِي طُغْيَانِهِمْ يَعْمَهُونَ,When the idolaters sought to hasten their chastisement the following was revealed And if God should hasten for mankind evil as they would hasten good their term of life would already have been concluded for them read as the passive with nominative ajaluhum sc. la-qudiya ajaluhum; or read as the active with accusative ajalahum sc. la-qadā ajalahum ‘He would have already concluded their term’ by His destroying them but He gives them respite. But We leave those who do not expect to encounter Us to wander blindly in their insolence hesistant and perplexed.
وَإِذَا مَسَّ ٱلإِنسَانَ ٱلضُّرُّ دَعَانَا لِجَنبِهِ أَوْ قَاعِداً أَوْ قَآئِماً فَلَمَّا كَشَفْنَا عَنْهُ ضُرَّهُ مَرَّ كَأَن لَّمْ يَدْعُنَآ إِلَىٰ ضُرٍّ مَّسَّهُ كَذٰلِكَ زُيِّنَ لِلْمُسْرِفِينَ مَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ,If misfortune illness or poverty should befall a disbelieving man he calls upon Us on his side that is lying down or sitting or standing in other words in every state; but when We have relieved him of his misfortune he passes on in his unbelief as if ka-an is softened its subject omitted in other words read as ka-annahu he had never called upon Us because of a misfortune that befell him. So in the same way that supplication during misfortune and abstention from supplication in times of comfort were adorned for him is adorned for the prodigal the idolaters that which they do.
وَلَقَدْ أَهْلَكْنَا ٱلْقُرُونَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ لَمَّا ظَلَمُواْ وَجَآءَتْهُمْ رُسُلُهُم بِٱلْبَيِّنَاتِ وَمَا كَانُواْ لِيُؤْمِنُواْ كَذٰلِكَ نَجْزِي ٱلْقَوْمَ ٱلْمُجْرِمِينَ,And indeed We have destroyed generations communities before you O people of Mecca when they did evil by way of idolatry and indeed their messengers brought them clear proofs indicating their truthfulness; but they would not believe wa-mā kānū li-yu’minū this is a supplement to zalamū ‘they did evil’. So just as We destroyed those We shall requite the sinning the unbelieving folk.
ثُمَّ جَعَلْنَاكُمْ خَلاَئِفَ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ مِن بَعْدِهِم لِنَنظُرَ كَيْفَ تَعْمَلُونَ,Then We made you O people of Mecca successors khalā’if is the plural of khalīfa in the earth after them that We might behold how you would behave in it and whether you would take heed from their example and believe in Our messengers.
وَإِذَا تُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْهِمْ آيَاتُنَا بَيِّنَاتٍ قَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ لاَ يَرْجُونَ لِقَآءَنَا ٱئْتِ بِقُرْآنٍ غَيْرِ هَـٰذَآ أَوْ بَدِّلْهُ قُلْ مَا يَكُونُ لِيۤ أَنْ أُبَدِّلَهُ مِن تِلْقَآءِ نَفْسِيۤ إِنْ أَتَّبِعُ إِلاَّ مَا يُوحَىۤ إِلَيَّ إِنِّيۤ أَخَافُ إِنْ عَصَيْتُ رَبِّي عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ,And when Our clear manifest bayyināt is a circumstantial qualifier verses from the Qur’ān are recited to them those who do not expect to encounter Us those who do not fear the Resurrection say ‘Bring a Qur’ān other than this one in which our gods are not denigrated or change it’ of your own accord. Say to them ‘It is not for me to change it of my own accord. I only follow that which is revealed to me. Truly I fear if I should disobey my Lord by changing it the chastisement of a dreadful day’ that is the Day of Resurrection.
قُل لَّوْ شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ مَا تَلَوْتُهُ عَلَيْكُمْ وَلاَ أَدْرَاكُمْ بِهِ فَقَدْ لَبِثْتُ فِيكُمْ عُمُراً مِّن قَبْلِهِ أَفَلاَ تَعْقِلُونَ,Say ‘If God had willed I would not have recited it to you nor would He have made it known to you nor would He have made you aware of it the lā of wa-lā adrākum is for negation and is a supplement to what preceded; a variant reading has the lām sc. la-adrākum ‘He would have made it known to you’ as the response to the conditional law ‘if’ in other words He would have made it known to you by the tongue of someone other than myself. For I have already dwelt among you a whole lifetime of forty years before this Qur’ān not relating to you anything of the sort so will you not understand?’ that this Qur’ān is not from myself?
فَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّنِ ٱفْتَرَىٰ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ كَذِباً أَوْ كَذَّبَ بِآيَـٰتِهِ إِنَّهُ لاَ يُفْلِحُ ٱلْمُجْرِمُونَ,And who that is no one does greater evil than he who invents a lie against God by ascribing a partner to Him or denies His signs? denies the Qur’ān. Surely it is that the sinners the idolaters shall not prosper they shall never find happiness.
وَيَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ مَا لاَ يَضُرُّهُمْ وَلاَ يَنفَعُهُمْ وَيَقُولُونَ هَـٰؤُلاۤءِ شُفَعَاؤُنَا عِندَ ٱللَّهِ قُلْ أَتُنَبِّئُونَ ٱللَّهَ بِمَا لاَ يَعْلَمُ فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَلاَ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَىٰ عَمَّا يُشْرِكُونَ,And they worship besides God that is other than Him that which can neither hurt them should they not worship it nor profit them if they do worship it — and these are the idols; and they say of them ‘These are our intercessors with God’. Say to them ‘Would you tell would you inform God of what He does not know in the heavens or in the earth?’ the interrogative is meant as a disavowal for if He had a partner He Himself would know it since nothing can be hidden from Him. Glory be to Him! in affirmation of His transcendence and High be He exalted above what they associate! with Him.
وَمَا كَانَ ٱلنَّاسُ إِلاَّ أُمَّةً وَاحِدَةً فَٱخْتَلَفُواْ وَلَوْلاَ كَلِمَةٌ سَبَقَتْ مِن رَّبِّكَ لَقُضِيَ بَيْنَهُمْ فِيمَا فِيهِ يَخْتَلِفُونَ,Mankind was but one community following one religion that is submission to the One God from the time of Adam to the time of Noah; but it is also said that this was the case from the time of Abraham to that of ‘Amr b. Luhayy; then they differed some of them remaining firmly upon belief in One God while others disbelieved. And had it not been for a word that had already preceded from your Lord to the effect that requital would be deferred until the Day of Resurrection it would have been decided between them that is between mankind in this life regarding that over which they differed in religion by the disbelievers being punished.
وَيَقُولُونَ لَوْلاَ أُنزِلَ عَلَيْهِ آيَةٌ مِّن رَّبِّهِ فَقُلْ إِنَّمَا ٱلْغَيْبُ للَّهِ فَٱنْتَظِرُوۤاْ إِنِّي مَعَكُمْ مِّنَ ٱلْمُنتَظِرِينَ,And they the people of Mecca say ‘Why has a sign not been sent down on him on Muhammad (s) from his Lord?’ as was the case with previous prophets in the way of a she-camel a staff or a glowing hand. Then say to them ‘The Unseen that which is concealed from servants in other words its affair belongs only to God and it is from this Unseen that signs come forth; therefore He alone can bring them forth mine is only to covey the Message. So wait for the chastisement if you do not believe. I am waiting with you’.
وَإِذَآ أَذَقْنَا ٱلنَّاسَ رَحْمَةً مِّن بَعْدِ ضَرَّآءَ مَسَّتْهُمْ إِذَا لَهُمْ مَّكْرٌ فِيۤ آيَاتِنَا قُلِ ٱللَّهُ أَسْرَعُ مَكْراً إِنَّ رُسُلَنَا يَكْتُبُونَ مَا تَمْكُرُونَ,And when We made people that is the disbelievers of Mecca taste of mercy of rain and fertility after adversity misery and drought that had afflicted them behold! they have some plot concerning Our signs in the way of mockery and denial. Say to them ‘God is swifter at plotting at requiting; surely Our guardian messengers are writing down that which you are plotting’ tamkurūn is also read yamkurūn ‘they are plotting’.
هُوَ ٱلَّذِي يُسَيِّرُكُمْ فِي ٱلْبَرِّ وَٱلْبَحْرِ حَتَّىٰ إِذَا كُنتُمْ فِي ٱلْفُلْكِ وَجَرَيْنَ بِهِم بِرِيحٍ طَيِّبَةٍ وَفَرِحُواْ بِهَا جَآءَتْهَا رِيحٌ عَاصِفٌ وَجَآءَهُمُ ٱلْمَوْجُ مِن كُلِّ مَكَانٍ وَظَنُّوۤاْ أَنَّهُمْ أُحِيطَ بِهِمْ دَعَوُاْ ٱللَّهَ مُخْلِصِينَ لَهُ ٱلدِّينَ لَئِنْ أَنْجَيْتَنَا مِنْ هَـٰذِهِ لَنَكُونَنَّ مِنَ ٱلشَّاكِرِينَ,He it is Who conveys you yusayyirukum a variant reading has yanshurukum across the land and the sea until when you are in ships and they sail with them there is a shift of address from second to third person with a fair gentle breeze and they rejoice therein there comes upon them a stormy wind blowing violently destroying everything and waves come on them from every side and they think that they are overwhelmed that is that they shall perish they call upon God secure in their faith their supplication only to Him ‘If la-in the lām is for oaths You deliver us from these terrors we shall verily be of the thankful’ of those who affirm Your Oneness.
فَلَمَّآ أَنجَاهُمْ إِذَا هُمْ يَبْغُونَ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ بِغَيْرِ ٱلْحَقِّ يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّاسُ إِنَّمَا بَغْيُكُمْ عَلَىٰ أَنفُسِكُمْ مَّتَاعَ ٱلْحَيَاةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا ثُمَّ إِلَينَا مَرْجِعُكُمْ فَنُنَبِّئُكُمْ بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ,Yet when He has delivered them behold! they are insolent in the earth wrongfully by associating others with God. O mankind your insolence wrongdoing is only against yourselves since the sin thereof shall fall against them; it is but the enjoyment of the life of this world which you will enjoy for a short while then to Us is your return after death and We shall inform you of what you used to do and then requite you for it a variant reading for nominative matā‘u has accusative matā‘a ‘an enjoyment’ in other words read as with an omitted verb such as tatamatta‘ūna ‘one which you shall enjoy’.
إِنَّمَا مَثَلُ ٱلْحَيَاةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا كَمَآءٍ أَنزَلْنَاهُ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ فَٱخْتَلَطَ بِهِ نَبَاتُ ٱلأَرْضِ مِمَّا يَأْكُلُ ٱلنَّاسُ وَٱلأَنْعَامُ حَتَّىٰ إِذَآ أَخَذَتِ ٱلأَرْضُ زُخْرُفَهَا وَٱزَّيَّنَتْ وَظَنَّ أَهْلُهَآ أَنَّهُمْ قَادِرُونَ عَلَيْهَآ أَتَاهَآ أَمْرُنَا لَيْلاً أَوْ نَهَاراً فَجَعَلْنَاهَا حَصِيداً كَأَن لَّمْ تَغْنَ بِٱلأَمْسِ كَذٰلِكَ نُفَصِّلُ ٱلآيَاتِ لِقَوْمٍ يَتَفَكَّرُونَ,The likeness the description of the life of this world is only as water rain which We send down from the heaven then the plants of the earth mingle with it they mingle because of it attaching themselves one to another whereof mankind eat plants such as wheat and barley and so on and cattle eat of pasture until when the earth has taken on its ornaments its splendour of plants and has adorned itself with flowers izzayyanat ‘adorned itself’ is originally tazayyanat but the tā’ has been substituted with the zāy and assimilated with it and its inhabitants think that they are masters of it fully capable of harvesting its fruits Our command Our decree or Our chastisement comes upon it by night or day and We make it that is its crops as reaped corn like that which has been reaped with sickles as though ka-an is softened in other words read it as ka-annahā the previous day it had not flourished as though it never were. Thus do We detail do We make clear the signs for a people who reflect.
وَٱللَّهُ يَدْعُوۤاْ إِلَىٰ دَارِ ٱلسَّلاَمِ وَيَهْدِي مَن يَشَآءُ إِلَىٰ صِرَاطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ,And God summons to the Abode of Peace that is the Abode of security which is Paradise by summoning people to faith and He guides whomever He wills that he be guided to a straight path the religion of Islam.
لِّلَّذِينَ أَحْسَنُواْ ٱلْحُسْنَىٰ وَزِيَادَةٌ وَلاَ يَرْهَقُ وُجُوهَهُمْ قَتَرٌ وَلاَ ذِلَّةٌ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ أَصْحَابُ ٱلْجَنَّةِ هُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ,For those who do good by having faith is the fairest reward Paradise and more which is to contemplate God exalted be He as reported in a hadīth by Muslim in his Sahīh; neither dust soot nor ignominy grief shall overcome envelop their faces. Those they are the inhabitants of Paradise therein they will abide.
وَٱلَّذِينَ كَسَبُواْ ٱلسَّيِّئَاتِ جَزَآءُ سَيِّئَةٍ بِمِثْلِهَا وَتَرْهَقُهُمْ ذِلَّةٌ مَّا لَهُمْ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ مِنْ عَاصِمٍ كَأَنَّمَا أُغْشِيَتْ وُجُوهُهُمْ قِطَعاً مِّنَ ٱلْلَّيْلِ مُظْلِماً أُوْلَـٰئِكَ أَصْحَابُ ٱلنَّارِ هُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ,And for those wa’lladhīna is a supplement to li’lladhīna ahsanū ‘for those who do good’ so understand it as wa-li’lladhīna ‘and for those’ who earn evil deeds by practising idolatry there shall be the requital of an evil deed by the like thereof; ignominy shall overcome them — they have no protector no defender against God — as if their faces had been covered with cloaked in strips of darkest night read qita‘an as the plural of qit‘a; or qit‘an meaning juz’an ‘a part’. Those they are the inhabitants of the Fire therein they will abide.
وَيَوْمَ نَحْشُرُهُمْ جَمِيعاً ثُمَّ نَقُولُ لِلَّذِينَ أَشْرَكُواْ مَكَانَكُمْ أَنتُمْ وَشُرَكَآؤُكُمْ فَزَيَّلْنَا بَيْنَهُمْ وَقَالَ شُرَكَآؤُهُمْ مَّا كُنتُمْ إِيَّانَا تَعْبُدُونَ,And mention the day on which We shall gather them that is creation all together then We shall say to those who associated others with God ‘In your place! makānakum is in the accusative because ilzamū ‘adhere to’ is implied sc. ilzamū makānakum. You antum this emphasises the second person plural subject concealed in the implied verb ilzamū and allows for the supplement that follows and your associates!’ that is the idols. Then We shall make a separation We shall distinguish between them and the believers as is stated in the verse wa’mtāzū’l-yawma ayyuhā’l-mujrimūn ‘Now be separate you sinners upon this day!’ Q. 3659; and their associates will say to them ‘It was not us that you were worshipping mā of mā-kuntum ‘you were not …’ is for negation; the direct object iyyānā ‘us’ precedes the verb in order to accord with the end-rhyme of the Qur’ānic verse;
فَكَفَىٰ بِٱللَّهِ شَهِيداً بَيْنَنَا وَبَيْنَكُمْ إِن كُنَّا عَنْ عِبَادَتِكُمْ لَغَافِلِينَ,God suffices as a witness between us and you that indeed in is softened so read as innā we were unaware of your worship’.
هُنَالِكَ تَبْلُواْ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ مَّآ أَسْلَفَتْ وَرُدُّوۤاْ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ مَوْلاَهُمُ ٱلْحَقِّ وَضَلَّ عَنْهُمْ مَّا كَانُواْ يَفْتَرُونَ,There that is on that day every soul shall experience tablū derives from balwā ‘a trial’; a variant reading has tatlū ‘it shall recite’ derived from tilāwa ‘recitation’ what it did before what it offered in the way of deeds and they shall be returned to God their rightful their established everlasting Lord and that which they were inventing of lies against Him in the way of associates shall fail them shall be absent before them.
قُلْ مَن يَرْزُقُكُم مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ وَٱلأَرْضِ أَمَّن يَمْلِكُ ٱلسَّمْعَ وٱلأَبْصَارَ وَمَن يُخْرِجُ ٱلْحَيَّ مِنَ ٱلْمَيِّتِ وَيُخْرِجُ ٱلْمَيِّتَ مِنَ ٱلْحَيِّ وَمَن يُدَبِّرُ ٱلأَمْرَ فَسَيَقُولُونَ ٱللَّهُ فَقُلْ أَفَلاَ تَتَّقُونَ,Say to them ‘Who provides for you rain out of the heaven and plants out of the earth or Who owns hearing meaning the ability to make hear that is the creation of this faculty and sight and Who brings forth the living from the dead and brings forth the dead from the living and Who directs affairs?’ between creatures? They will surely say ‘It is He God.’ Then say to them ‘Will you not then fear?’ Him and believe?
فَذَلِكُمُ ٱللَّهُ رَبُّكُمُ ٱلْحَقُّ فَمَاذَا بَعْدَ ٱلْحَقِّ إِلاَّ ٱلضَّلاَلُ فَأَنَّىٰ تُصْرَفُونَ,That Doer of all these things then is God your true established Lord so what is there after truth except error? the interrogative is meant as an affirmative in other words there is nothing after it truth other than that error; thus he who mistakes the truth which is the worship of God has fallen into error. How then are you turned away from faith despite the proofs having been established?
كَذَلِكَ حَقَّتْ كَلِمَتُ رَبِّكَ عَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ فَسَقُوۤاْ أَنَّهُمْ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ,Thus just as those are turned away from faith so the Word of your Lord is justified concerning those who are wicked those who disbelieve and this Word is either the verse Q. 3213‘Verily I shall fill Hell with jinn and mankind together’ or it is the following that they do not believe.
قُلْ هَلْ مِن شُرَكَآئِكُمْ مَّن يَبْدَؤُاْ ٱلْخَلْقَ ثُمَّ يُعِيدُهُ قُلِ ٱللَّهُ يَبْدَؤُاْ ٱلْخَلْقَ ثُمَّ يُعِيدُهُ فَأَنَّىٰ تُؤْفَكُونَ,Say ‘Is there of those whom you associate with God one that originates creation then recreated it?’ Say ‘God originates creation then recreates it. How then are you deviated?’ turned away from worshipping Him despite proof having been established.
قُلْ هَلْ مِن شُرَكَآئِكُمْ مَّن يَهْدِيۤ إِلَى ٱلْحَقِّ قُلِ ٱللَّهُ يَهْدِي لِلْحَقِّ أَفَمَن يَهْدِيۤ إِلَى ٱلْحَقِّ أَحَقُّ أَن يُتَّبَعَ أَمَّن لاَّ يَهِدِّيۤ إِلاَّ أَن يُهْدَىٰ فَمَا لَكُمْ كَيْفَ تَحْكُمُونَ,Say ‘Is there of those whom you associate with God one that guides to the truth?’ by means of setting up definitive arguments and creating guidance. Say ‘God guides to the truth; is One Who guides to the truth — and this is God — more deserving of being followed or one who does not guide one who is not himself guided unless he is guided? more deserving of being followed? the interrogative is meant as an affirmation and a rebuke in other words the former is more deserving. So what is wrong with you how do you judge?’ how do you make this corrupt judgement one where what does not deserve to be followed is followed?
وَمَا يَتَّبِعُ أَكْثَرُهُمْ إِلاَّ ظَنّاً إِنَّ ٱلظَّنَّ لاَ يُغْنِي مِنَ ٱلْحَقِّ شَيْئاً إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلَيمٌ بِمَا يَفْعَلُونَ,And most of them in worshipping idols follow nothing but conjecture since they imitate their fathers therein; truly conjecture avails nothing against truth when what is sought is knowledge. Surely God is Knower of what they do and will requite them for it.
وَمَا كَانَ هَـٰذَا ٱلْقُرْآنُ أَن يُفْتَرَىٰ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ وَلَـٰكِن تَصْدِيقَ ٱلَّذِي بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ وَتَفْصِيلَ ٱلْكِتَابِ لاَ رَيْبَ فِيهِ مِن رَّبِّ ٱلْعَالَمِينَ,And this Qur’ān is not such as could ever be produced that is it could not be a fabrication by anyone besides God; but it is revealed as a confirmation of what is before it of Scriptures and a detailing of the Book a exposition of the rulings and other matters which God has prescribed — wherein is no doubt no uncertainty — from the Lord of the Worlds min rabbi’l-‘ālamīn is semantically connected to tasdīqa ‘a confirmation’ or to an omitted unzila ‘revealed’; a variant reading for accusative tasdīqa has the nominative tasdīqu and nominative tafsīlu ‘a detailing’ for the accusative tafsīla by reading an implied huwa ‘it is’.
أَمْ يَقُولُونَ ٱفْتَرَاهُ قُلْ فَأْتُواْ بِسُورَةٍ مِّثْلِهِ وَٱدْعُواْ مَنِ ٱسْتَطَعْتُمْ مِّن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ إِن كُنتُمْ صَادِقِينَ,Or do they say ‘He has invented it’? Muhammad (s) has invented it. Say ‘Then bring a sūra like it in terms of the clarity and the rhetorical excellence of its language by way of invention for you are eloquent speakers of Arabic like me; and call upon whom you can for help in this matter besides God that is other than Him if you are truthful’ in saying that this is an invention. But they were not able to do this.
بَلْ كَذَّبُواْ بِمَا لَمْ يُحِيطُواْ بِعِلْمِهِ وَلَمَّا يَأْتِهِمْ تَأْوِيلُهُ كَذَلِكَ كَذَّبَ ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ فَٱنْظُرْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَاقِبَةُ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ,God exalted be He says Nay but they denied that the knowledge whereof they did not comprehend that is they denied the Qur’ān and did not reflected upon it; and whereof the interpretation the consequence of the threats made therein has not yet come to them. So in the same manner of denial those who were before them denied their messengers. Behold then what was the consequence for the evildoers! for denying the messengers in other words behold how their affair was concluded by their being destroyed. In a similar manner We shall destroy these people.
وَمِنهُمْ مَّن يُؤْمِنُ بِهِ وَمِنْهُمْ مَّن لاَّ يُؤْمِنُ بِهِ وَرَبُّكَ أَعْلَمُ بِٱلْمُفْسِدِينَ,And of them that is of the people of Mecca are some who believe in it God being aware of this in their case and some who would never believe therein. And your Lord knows very well the corrupters this is a threat for them.
وَإِن كَذَّبُوكَ فَقُل لِّي عَمَلِي وَلَكُمْ عَمَلُكُمْ أَنتُمْ بَرِيۤئُونَ مِمَّآ أَعْمَلُ وَأَنَاْ بَرِيۤءٌ مِّمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ,If they deny you then say to them ‘Unto me is my work and to you your work that is for each there will be a due requital of his deeds; you are innocent of what I do and I am innocent of what you do’ this was abrogated by the ‘sword’ verse Q. 95.
وَمِنْهُمْ مَّن يَسْتَمِعُونَ إِلَيْكَ أَفَأَنتَ تُسْمِعُ ٱلصُّمَّ وَلَوْ كَانُواْ لاَ يَعْقِلُونَ,And of them are some who listen to you when you recite the Qur’ān. But will you make the deaf to hear — He likens them the Meccan disbelievers to these the deaf because they are not able to benefit from what is recited to them — even though with their deafness they do not understand? even though they do not reflect?
وَمِنهُمْ مَّن يَنظُرُ إِلَيْكَ أَفَأَنْتَ تَهْدِي ٱلْعُمْيَ وَلَوْ كَانُواْ لاَ يُبْصِرُونَ,And of them are some who look toward you. But will you guide the blind even though they do not see? — He likens them the Meccan disbelievers to these the blind because they fail to be guided nay they are much worse since God says It is not the eyes that are blind but blind are the hearts within the breasts Q. 2246.
إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لاَ يَظْلِمُ ٱلنَّاسَ شَيْئاً وَلَـٰكِنَّ ٱلنَّاسَ أَنفُسَهُمْ يَظْلِمُونَ,Verily God does not wrong mankind in any way but mankind wrong themselves.
وَيَوْمَ يَحْشُرُهُمْ كَأَن لَّمْ يَلْبَثُوۤاْ إِلاَّ سَاعَةً مِّنَ ٱلنَّهَارِ يَتَعَارَفُونَ بَيْنَهُمْ قَدْ خَسِرَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَذَّبُواْ بِلِقَآءِ ٱللَّهِ وَمَا كَانُواْ مُهْتَدِينَ,And on the day when He shall gather them it is as if they had not tarried in this world or in the grave but an hour of the day because of the terror of what they see the comparative sentence is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the third person pronoun; recognising one another knowing one another upon their being resurrected but thereafter the recognition ceases on account of the severity of the terrors the last sentence is either an implied circumstantial qualifier or one connected to the adverbial qualifier yawma ‘on the day’; those will verily have lost who denied the encounter with God through resurrection for they were not guided.
وَإِمَّا نُرِيَنَّكَ بَعْضَ ٱلَّذِي نَعِدُهُمْ أَوْ نَتَوَفَّيَنَّكَ فَإِلَيْنَا مَرْجِعُهُمْ ثُمَّ ٱللَّهُ شَهِيدٌ عَلَىٰ مَا يَفْعَلُونَ,And whether wa-immā the nūn of the conditional particle in has been assimiliated with the extra mā We show you something of that which We promise them of chastisement during your lifetime the response to the conditional statement has been omitted in other words understand it as being fa-dhāka ‘then so shall it be’ or We take you to Us before punishing them to Us they shall return and God moreover is Witness Aware of what they do in the way of their denials and disbelief and so will chastise them with the severest punishment.
وَلِكُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولٌ فَإِذَا جَآءَ رَسُولُهُمْ قُضِيَ بَيْنَهُمْ بِٱلْقِسْطِ وَهُمْ لاَ يُظْلَمُونَ,And for every community of the communities of this world there is a messenger. And when their messenger comes to them and they deny him judgement is passed between them justly fairly such that they are punished and the messenger and all those who accepted his truthfulness are delivered; and they are not wronged by being punished for no crime similarly We shall deal with these disbelievers of your community.
وَيَقُولُونَ مَتَىٰ هَـٰذَا ٱلْوَعْدُ إِن كُنتُمْ صَادِقِينَ,And they say ‘When will this promise of chastisement come to pass if you are truthful about it?’
قُل لاَّ أَمْلِكُ لِنَفْسِي ضَرّاً وَلاَ نَفْعاً إِلاَّ مَا شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ لِكُلِّ أُمَّةٍ أَجَلٌ إِذَا جَآءَ أَجَلُهُمْ فَلاَ يَسْتَأْخِرُونَ سَاعَةً وَلاَ يَسْتَقْدِمُونَ,Say ‘I have no power to avert hurt from myself or to bring benefit except as God might will to give me power over so how could I possess the power to bring about the chastisement? For every community there is an appointed time a fixed period until they perish. When their time comes they cannot put it off they will not miss it by a single hour nor bring it forward nor overtake it’.
قُلْ أَرَأَيْتُمْ إِنْ أَتَاكُمْ عَذَابُهُ بَيَاتاً أَوْ نَهَاراً مَّاذَا يَسْتَعْجِلُ مِنْهُ ٱلْمُجْرِمُونَ,Say ‘Have you considered? Say inform me If His God’s chastisement comes upon you by night or day what part is there of it that is of the chastisement that the sinners the idolaters seek to hasten? an overt noun al-mujrimūn ‘the sinners’ has replaced the second person ‘you’ pronominalisation. The interrogative sentence is the response to the conditional as in the case where you might say ‘If I come to you what would you give me?’; the intention here is to provoke terror in them in other words how awful is that which they seek to hasten!
أَثُمَّ إِذَا مَا وَقَعَ آمَنْتُمْ بِهِ الآنَ وَقَدْ كُنتُم بِهِ تَسْتَعْجِلُونَ,Is it only then when it has come to pass when it has befallen you that you will believe therein? that is in God or it means in the chastisement when it has come down the use of hamza in a-thumma ‘is it then’ is to deny the possibility of deferrment of chastisement in other words it your belief will not be accepted from you in that instance and it will be said to you Now do you believe when until now you have been hastening it on?’ in mockery of it.
ثُمَّ قِيلَ لِلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ ذُوقُواْ عَذَابَ ٱلْخُلْدِ هَلْ تُجْزَوْنَ إِلاَّ بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَكْسِبُونَ,Then will it be said to those who were evildoers ‘Taste the everlasting chastisement! that is the one in which you shall abide. Are you you are not requited for anything but the requital of what you used to earn?’
وَيَسْتَنْبِئُونَكَ أَحَقٌّ هُوَ قُلْ إِي وَرَبِّيۤ إِنَّهُ لَحَقٌّ وَمَآ أَنتُمْ بِمُعْجِزِينَ,And they ask you to tell to inform them ‘Is it true?’ that which you promise us in the way of chastisement and resurrection? Say ‘Aye indeed by my Lord! Verily it is true and you cannot escape’ you cannot elude the chastisement.
وَلَوْ أَنَّ لِكُلِّ نَفْسٍ ظَلَمَتْ مَا فِي ٱلأَرْضِ لاَفْتَدَتْ بِهِ وَأَسَرُّواْ ٱلنَّدَامَةَ لَمَّا رَأَوُاْ ٱلْعَذَابَ وَقُضِيَ بَيْنَهُمْ بِٱلْقِسْطِ وَهُمْ لاَ يُظْلَمُونَ,And if each soul that has done wrong that has disbelieved had all that is in the earth of riches it would offer it as ransom against chastisement on the Day of Resurrection; and they will feel remorse within them for having neglected faith when they see the chastisement their leaders keep it their remorse secret from the weak ones whom they had led astray fearing reproach but it has been decided justly between them between all creatures and they are not wronged in anything.
أَلاۤ إِنَّ للَّهِ مَا فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ أَلاَ إِنَّ وَعْدَ ٱللَّهِ حَقٌّ وَلَـٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَهُمْ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ,Why surely to God belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth. Why surely God’s promise of resurrection and requital is true is fixed but most of them people do not know this.
هُوَ يُحْيِـي وَيُمِيتُ وَإِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ,He gives life and makes to die and to Him you shall be returned in the Hereafter and He shall requite you for your deeds.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّاسُ قَدْ جَآءَتْكُمْ مَّوْعِظَةٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَشِفَآءٌ لِّمَا فِي ٱلصُّدُورِ وَهُدًى وَرَحْمَةٌ لِّلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,O people that is inhabitants of Mecca there has come to you an admonition from your Lord a Book which contains mention of that which is permissible for you and that which is enjoined on you and this Book is the Qur’ān; and a healing a cure for what is in the breasts of corrupt beliefs and uncertainties and a guidance from error and a mercy for those who believe in it.
قُلْ بِفَضْلِ ٱللَّهِ وَبِرَحْمَتِهِ فَبِذَلِكَ فَلْيَفْرَحُواْ هُوَ خَيْرٌ مِّمَّا يَجْمَعُونَ,Say ‘In the bounty of God that is Islam and in His mercy the Qur’ān in that bounty and mercy let them rejoice it is better than what they hoard’ in this world read yajma‘ūn ‘they hoard’ and tajma‘ūn ‘you hoard’.
قُلْ أَرَأَيْتُمْ مَّآ أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمْ مِّن رِّزْقٍ فَجَعَلْتُمْ مِّنْهُ حَرَاماً وَحَلاَلاً قُلْ ءَآللَّهُ أَذِنَ لَكُمْ أَمْ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ تَفْتَرُونَ,Say ‘Have you considered inform me what provision God has revealed has created for you how you have made some of it unlawful and some lawful?’ as in the case of the camels called al-Bahīra or al-Sā’iba and carrion. Say ‘Has God given you permission to make that lawful or unlawful? No! Or do you nay you invent lies concerning God?’ by attributing that to Him.
وَمَا ظَنُّ ٱلَّذِينَ يَفْتَرُونَ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ ٱلْكَذِبَ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَذُو فَضْلٍ عَلَى ٱلنَّاسِ وَلَـٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَهُمْ لاَ يَشْكُرُونَ,And what do they suppose those who invent lies concerning God will happen to them on the Day of Resurrection? do they reckon that He will not chastise them? No! Truly God is Bountiful to mankind by granting them respite and bestowing graces upon them but most of them do not give thanks.
وَمَا تَكُونُ فِي شَأْنٍ وَمَا تَتْلُواْ مِنْهُ مِن قُرْآنٍ وَلاَ تَعْمَلُونَ مِنْ عَمَلٍ إِلاَّ كُنَّا عَلَيْكُمْ شُهُوداً إِذْ تُفِيضُونَ فِيهِ وَمَا يَعْزُبُ عَن رَّبِّكَ مِن مِّثْقَالِ ذَرَّةٍ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَلاَ فِي ٱلسَّمَآءِ وَلاَ أَصْغَرَ مِن ذٰلِكَ وَلاۤ أَكْبَرَ إِلاَّ فِي كِتَابٍ مُّبِينٍ,And you O Muhammad (s) are not occupied with any business any matter nor do you recite anything regarding it that is regarding such a matter — or it means nor do you recite anything from God by way of the Qur’ān which He has revealed to you nor do you perform any action God is addressing him and his community but We are witnesses watchers over you when you are engaged therein that is in the action. And not so much as the weight of an atom the weight of the smallest ant in the earth or in the heaven escapes is hidden from your Lord nor what is less than that or greater but it is in a clear a manifest Book namely the Preserved Tablet al-lawh al-mahfūz.
أَلاۤ إِنَّ أَوْلِيَآءَ ٱللَّهِ لاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلاَ هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ,Assuredly God’s friends no fear shall befall them neither shall they grieve in the Hereafter.
ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَكَانُواْ يَتَّقُونَ,They are those who believe and fear God by observing His commandments and prohibitions.
لَهُمُ ٱلْبُشْرَىٰ فِي ٱلْحَياةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَفِي ٱلآخِرَةِ لاَ تَبْدِيلَ لِكَلِمَاتِ ٱللَّهِ ذٰلِكَ هُوَ ٱلْفَوْزُ ٱلْعَظِيمُ,Theirs are good tidings in the life of this world in a hadīth verified by al-Hākim this has been explained as referring to a propitious vision which an individual might have or a vision which another might have of that person; and in the Hereafter Paradise and reward. There is no changing the Words of God no failing of His promises; that mentioned is the supreme triumph.
وَلاَ يَحْزُنكَ قَوْلُهُمْ إِنَّ ٱلْعِزَّةَ لِلَّهِ جَمِيعاً هُوَ ٱلسَّمِيعُ ٱلْعَلِيمُ,And let not what they say to you that you have not been sent as a prophet or otherwise grieve you. Truly inna indicates a new sentence power might belongs wholly to God. He is the Hearer of speech the Knower of deeds and will requite them and grant you victory.
أَلاۤ إِنَّ لِلَّهِ مَن فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰت وَمَنْ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَمَا يَتَّبِعُ ٱلَّذِينَ يَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ شُرَكَآءَ إِن يَتَّبِعُونَ إِلاَّ ٱلظَّنَّ وَإِنْ هُمْ إِلاَّ يَخْرُصُونَ,Why surely to God belongs all who are in the heavens and all who are in the earth as servants possessions and creatures. Those who call upon those who worship besides God that is other than Him idols are not following associates of His in reality exalted be He above this they are following nothing but conjecture in this matter that is their supposition that these are gods who intercede for them and they are only telling lies in this matter.
هُوَ ٱلَّذِي جَعَلَ لَكُمُ ٱلَّيلَ لِتَسْكُنُواْ فِيهِ وَٱلنَّهَارَ مُبْصِراً إِنَّ فِي ذٰلِكَ لآيَاتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يَسْمَعُونَ,He it is Who made for you the night that you should rest therein and the day to see the attribution of sight ibsār to ‘the day’ is figurative since one is able to see during it. Surely in that are signs indications of His Oneness exalted be He for a folk who are able to hear hearing in such a way so as to reflect and be admonished.
قَالُواْ ٱتَّخَذَ ٱللَّهُ وَلَداً سُبْحَانَهُ هُوَ ٱلْغَنِيُّ لَهُ مَا فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰت وَمَا فِي ٱلأَرْضِ إِنْ عِندَكُمْ مِّن سُلْطَانٍ بِهَـٰذَآ أَتقُولُونَ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ مَا لاَ تَعْلَمُونَ,They that is the Jews and the Christians and those who claim that the angels are the daughters of God say ‘God has taken to Him a son’. God exalted be He says to them Glory be to Him! in affirmation of His transcending having offspring. He is Independent without need of anyone for only he who has need of a child would desire to have one. To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth as possessions creatures and servants. You have no warrant no proof for this that you say. Do you say about God what you do not know? an interrogative meant as a rebuke.
قُلْ إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يَفْتَرُونَ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ ٱلْكَذِبَ لاَ يُفْلِحُونَ,Say ‘Truly those who invent lies concerning God by attributing offspring to Him shall not prosper’ they shall not find happiness.
مَتَاعٌ فِي ٱلدُّنْيَا ثُمَّ إِلَيْنَا مَرْجِعُهُمْ ثُمَّ نُذِيقُهُمُ ٱلْعَذَابَ ٱلشَّدِيدَ بِمَا كَانُواْ يَكْفُرُونَ,Theirs will be enjoyment only a little in this world which they will enjoy for the duration of their lives then to Us is their return at death then We shall make them taste terrible chastisement after death because they used to disbelieve.
وَٱتْلُ عَلَيْهِمْ نَبَأَ نُوحٍ إِذْ قَالَ لِقَوْمِهِ يٰقَوْمِ إِن كَانَ كَبُرَ عَلَيْكُمْ مَّقَامِي وَتَذْكِيرِي بِآيَاتِ ٱللَّهِ فَعَلَى ٱللَّهِ تَوَكَّلْتُ فَأَجْمِعُوۤاْ أَمْرَكُمْ وَشُرَكَآءَكُمْ ثُمَّ لاَ يَكُنْ أَمْرُكُمْ عَلَيْكُمْ غُمَّةً ثُمَّ ٱقْضُوۤاْ إِلَيَّ وَلاَ تُنظِرُونَ,And recite O Muhammad (s) to them that is to the Meccan disbelievers the story the tale of Noah Nūhin is substituted by the following idh qāla when he said to his people ‘O my people if my sojourn my stay among you is too great to bear is a hardship for you as is my reminding you my admonishing you by the signs of God in God have I put my trust; so decide upon your course of action resolve upon what you will do to me together with your associates wa-shurakā’akum the wāw wa- means here ‘with’ then let not your decision be a secret between you concealed nay manifest it and proclaim it to me; then implement it against me carry out what you desire and do not put it off do not give me respite for I am not concerned by you.
فَإِن تَوَلَّيْتُمْ فَمَا سَأَلْتُكُمْ مِّنْ أَجْرٍ إِنْ أَجْرِيَ إِلاَّ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ وَأُمِرْتُ أَنْ أَكُونَ مِنَ ٱلْمُسْلِمِينَ,But if you turn away from my reminding you I have not asked you for any wage any reward for it so turn and go away my wage my reward falls only on God and I have been commanded to be of those who submit to God’.
فَكَذَّبُوهُ فَنَجَّيْنَاهُ وَمَن مَّعَهُ فِي ٱلْفُلْكِ وَجَعَلْنَاهُمْ خَلاَئِفَ وَأَغْرَقْنَا ٱلَّذِينَ كَذَّبُواْ بِآيَاتِنَا فَٱنْظُرْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَاقِبَةُ ٱلْمُنْذَرِينَ,But they denied him so We saved him and those with him in the Ark and made them that is those with him successors in the earth and We drowned those who denied Our signs by unleashing the Flood. Behold then the nature of the consequence for those who had been warned! in that they were destroyed likewise We deal with those who deny.
ثُمَّ بَعَثْنَا مِن بَعْدِهِ رُسُلاً إِلَىٰ قَوْمِهِمْ فَجَآءُوهُمْ بِٱلْبَيِّنَٰتِ فَمَا كَانُواْ لِيُؤْمِنُواْ بِمَا كَذَّبُواْ بِهِ مِن قَبْلُ كَذَٰلِكَ نَطْبَعُ عَلَىٰ قُلوبِ ٱلْمُعْتَدِينَ,Then after him that is after Noah We sent messengers to their people such as Abraham Hūd and Sālih and they brought them clear proofs miracles but it was not for them to believe in that which they had denied before that is before the sending of messengers to them. Thus do We seal stamp upon the hearts of the transgressors — so that they cannot accept faith — in the same way that We sealed the hearts of those before.
ثُمَّ بَعَثْنَا مِن بَعْدِهِمْ مُّوسَىٰ وَهَـٰرُونَ إِلَىٰ فِرْعَوْنَ وَمَلإِيْهِ بِآيَـٰتِنَا فَٱسْتَكْبَرُواْ وَكَانُواْ قَوْماً مُّجْرِمِينَ,Then after them We sent Moses and Aaron to Pharaoh and his council that is his folk with Our nine signs but they were disdainful to believe in them and were a sinful folk.
فَلَمَّا جَآءَهُمُ ٱلْحَقُّ مِنْ عِندِنَا قَالُوۤاْ إِنَّ هَـٰذَا لَسِحْرٌ مُّبِينٌ,So when the Truth came to them from Us they said ‘Surely this is manifest sorcery’ sorcery that is clear and evident.
قَالَ مُوسَىٰ أَتقُولُونَ لِلْحَقِّ لَمَّا جَآءَكُمْ أَسِحْرٌ هَـٰذَا وَلاَ يُفْلِحُ ٱلسَّاحِرُونَ,Moses said ‘Do you say so of the Truth when it has come to you that it is sorcery? Is this sorcery? when the one who has brought it has indeed prospered and has invalidated the sorcery of the sorcerers? Now sorcerers do not prosper’ the interrogative in both instances is meant as a disavowal.
قَالُوۤاْ أَجِئْتَنَا لِتَلْفِتَنَا عَمَّا وَجَدْنَا عَلَيْهِ آبَاءَنَا وَتَكُونَ لَكُمَا ٱلْكِبْرِيَآءُ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَمَا نَحْنُ لَكُمَا بِمُؤْمِنِينَ,They said ‘Have you come to us to divert us to turn us away from what we found our fathers following and that yours both might be the greatness the kingship in the land the land of Egypt? We will not believe you two’.
وَقَالَ فِرْعَوْنُ ٱئْتُونِي بِكُلِّ سَاحِرٍ عَلِيمٍ,And Pharaoh said ‘Bring me every cunning sorcerer’ every individual excelling in the art of sorcery.
فَلَمَّا جَآءَ ٱلسَّحَرَةُ قَالَ لَهُمْ مُّوسَىٰ أَلْقُواْ مَآ أَنتُمْ مُّلْقُونَ,And when the sorcerers came Moses said to them after they had said to him Either you cast or we shall be the casters! Q. 7115 ‘Cast your cast!’
فَلَمَّآ أَلْقَواْ قَالَ مُوسَىٰ مَا جِئْتُمْ بِهِ ٱلسِّحْرُ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ سَيُبْطِلُهُ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لاَ يُصْلِحُ عَمَلَ ٱلْمُفْسِدِينَ,Then when they had cast their ropes and staffs Moses said ‘What mā is interrogative and the subject its predicate being the following ji’tum bihi have you brought? Sorcery? ā’l-sihru a-al-sihru is a substitute for the predicate ji’tum bihi ‘have you brought’; a variant reading has al-sihru with a single hamza making it predicative in which case mā is the relative particle of the subject Verily God will bring it to nothing He will efface it. Truly God does not make right the work of those who do corruption.
وَيُحِقُّ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْحَقَّ بِكَلِمَاتِهِ وَلَوْ كَرِهَ ٱلْمُجْرِمُونَ,And God will vindicate He will establish and make prevail the Truth by His words by His promises however much the sinners be averse’.
فَمَآ آمَنَ لِمُوسَىٰ إِلاَّ ذُرِّيَّةٌ مِّن قَوْمِهِ عَلَىٰ خَوْفٍ مِّن فِرْعَوْنَ وَمَلَئِهِمْ أَن يَفْتِنَهُمْ وَإِنَّ فِرْعَوْنَ لَعَالٍ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَإِنَّهُ لَمِنَ ٱلْمُسْرِفِينَ,But with Moses none believed save a few descendants a party of the children of his that is Pharaoh’s folk out of fear of Pharaoh and their council that he Pharaoh might persecute them turn them away from his Moses’s religion by torturing them; and truly Pharaoh was despotic arrogant in the land the land of Egypt and truly he was of the prodigal of those who transgress the bounds by claiming to be Lords.
وَقَالَ مُوسَىٰ يٰقَوْمِ إِن كُنتُمْ آمَنتُمْ بِٱللَّهِ فَعَلَيْهِ تَوَكَّلُوۤاْ إِن كُنتُم مُّسْلِمِينَ,And Moses said ‘O my people if you have believed in God then put your trust in Him if you have truly submitted to Him’.
فَقَالُواْ عَلَىٰ ٱللَّهِ تَوَكَّلْنَا رَبَّنَا لاَ تَجْعَلْنَا فِتْنَةً لِّلْقَوْمِ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ,So they said ‘In God we have put our trust. Our Lord make us not a cause of temptation for the evildoing folk that is do not make them prevail over us lest they then think that they are upon the right path and so end up succumbing to the temptation of thinking that they are upon the right path because of us;
وَنَجِّنَا بِرَحْمَتِكَ مِنَ ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلْكَافِرِينَ,and deliver us by Your mercy from the unbelieving folk’.
وَأَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَىٰ مُوسَىٰ وَأَخِيهِ أَن تَبَوَّءَا لِقَوْمِكُمَا بِمِصْرَ بُيُوتاً وَٱجْعَلُواْ بُيُوتَكُمْ قِبْلَةً وَأَقِيمُواْ ٱلصَّلاَةَ وَبَشِّرِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,And We inspired Moses and his brother saying ‘Appoint houses for your people in Egypt and make your houses oratories places in which to perform prayers so that you might be secure from fear — for Pharaoh had prohibited them from performing prayers — and establish fulfil worship; and give good tidings to the believers’ of victory and Paradise.
وَقَالَ مُوسَىٰ رَبَّنَآ إِنَّكَ آتَيْتَ فِرْعَوْنَ وَمَلأَهُ زِينَةً وَأَمْوَالاً فِي ٱلْحَيَاةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا رَبَّنَا لِيُضِلُّواْ عَن سَبِيلِكَ رَبَّنَا ٱطْمِسْ عَلَىٰ أَمْوَالِهِمْ وَٱشْدُدْ عَلَىٰ قُلُوبِهِمْ فَلاَ يُؤْمِنُواْ حَتَّىٰ يَرَوُاْ ٱلْعَذَابَ ٱلأَلِيمَ,And Moses said ‘Our Lord You have indeed given Pharaoh and his council splendour and riches in the life of this world. Our Lord You have given them this that they may lead people astray as a consequence thereof from Your way from Your religion. Our Lord obliterate transform their riches and harden their hearts stamp upon them and shackle them so that they do not believe until they see the painful chastisement’ he Moses invoked God against them and Aaron said ‘Amen’ at the end of his invocation.
قَالَ قَدْ أُجِيبَتْ دَّعْوَتُكُمَا فَٱسْتَقِيمَا وَلاَ تَتَّبِعَآنِّ سَبِيلَ ٱلَّذِينَ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ,He God exalted be He said ‘Your prayer has been answered thus their riches were transformed into stones and Pharaoh did not believe until he was about to drown. So the two of you remain upright with the Message and the Call until such time as chastisement befalls them and do not follow the way of those who have no knowledge’ when they seek to hasten on My judgement — it is reported that he Moses remained alive a further forty years thereafter.
وَجَاوَزْنَا بِبَنِيۤ إِسْرَائِيلَ ٱلْبَحْرَ فَأَتْبَعَهُمْ فِرْعَوْنُ وَجُنُودُهُ بَغْياً وَعَدْواً حَتَّىٰ إِذَآ أَدْرَكَهُ ٱلْغَرَقُ قَالَ آمَنتُ أَنَّهُ لاۤ إِلِـٰهَ إِلاَّ ٱلَّذِي آمَنَتْ بِهِ بَنوۤاْ إِسْرَائِيلَ وَأَنَاْ مِنَ ٱلْمُسْلِمِينَ,And We brought the Children of Israel across the sea; and Pharaoh pursued them he caught up with them together with his hosts in insolence and transgression baghyan wa-‘adwan these constitute the direct object denoting reason until when the fate of drowning overtook him he said ‘I believe that annahu is to be understood as bi-annahu; a variant reading has innahu ‘truly it is …’ indicating a new sentence there is no god save Him in whom the Children of Israel believe and I am of those who submit to Him’ he reiterated this his submission to God so that it might be accepted from him but it was not; and Gabriel thrust mud from the sea into his mouth lest God’s mercy embrace him. And he Gabriel said to him
آلآنَ وَقَدْ عَصَيْتَ قَبْلُ وَكُنتَ مِنَ ٱلْمُفْسِدِينَ,‘Now do you believe when hitherto you have disobeyed and been of those who do corruption? on account of your being astray and your leading others astray away from belief.
فَٱلْيَوْمَ نُنَجِّيكَ بِبَدَنِكَ لِتَكُونَ لِمَنْ خَلْفَكَ آيَةً وَإِنَّ كَثِيراً مِّنَ ٱلنَّاسِ عَنْ آيَاتِنَا لَغَافِلُونَ,But this day We shall save you We shall bring you out of the sea in your body your lifeless corpse that you may be for those after you a sign a lesson that they might come to know your servitude and not venture upon deeds like yours. According to Ibn ‘Abbās some of the Children of Israel doubted his death and so he was brought out of the sea for them to see. And truly most people that is the people of Mecca are heedless of Our signs’ not learning the lesson therefrom.
وَلَقَدْ بَوَّأْنَا بَنِيۤ إِسْرَائِيلَ مُبَوَّأَ صِدْقٍ وَرَزَقْنَاهُمْ مِّنَ ٱلطَّيِّبَاتِ فَمَا ٱخْتَلَفُواْ حَتَّىٰ جَآءَهُمُ ٱلْعِلْمُ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ يَقْضِي بَيْنَهُمْ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ فِيمَا كَانُواْ فِيهِ يَخْتَلِفُونَ,And verily We appointed for the Children of Israel an excellent abode a noble place of residence namely Syria and Egypt and We provided them with good things; and they did not differ such that some believed while others disbelieved until the knowledge came to them. Truly your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that wherein they used to differ.
فَإِن كُنتَ فِي شَكٍّ مِّمَّآ أَنزَلْنَآ إِلَيْكَ فَاسْأَلِ ٱلَّذِينَ يَقْرَءُونَ ٱلْكِتَابَ مِن قَبْلِكَ لَقَدْ جَآءَكَ ٱلْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّكَ فَلاَ تَكُونَنَّ مِنَ ٱلْمُمْتَرِينَ,So if you O Muhammad (s) are in doubt concerning what We have revealed to you of stories — hypothetically speaking — then question those who read the Scripture the Torah before you for it is confirmed therein with them and they can inform you of its truth. The Prophet s said ‘I have no doubt nor will I question’. Verily the Truth from your Lord has come to you; so do not be of the waverers of those who have doubts about it.
وَلاَ تَكُونَنَّ مِنَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَذَّبُواْ بِآيَاتِ ٱللَّهِ فَتَكُونَ مِنَ ٱلْخَاسِرِينَ,And do not be of those who deny God’s signs and so be of the losers.
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ حَقَّتْ عَلَيْهِمْ كَلِمَتُ رَبِّكَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ,Truly those against whom your Lord’s Word of chastisement is justified against whom it is due will not believe
وَلَوْ جَآءَتْهُمْ كُلُّ آيَةٍ حَتَّىٰ يَرَوُاْ ٱلْعَذَابَ ٱلأَلِيمَ,though every sign come to them until they see the painful chastisement at which time it their belief will be of no use to them.
فَلَوْلاَ كَانَتْ قَرْيَةٌ آمَنَتْ فَنَفَعَهَآ إِيمَانُهَا إِلاَّ قَوْمَ يُونُسَ لَمَّآ آمَنُواْ كَشَفْنَا عَنْهُمْ عَذَابَ ٱلخِزْيِ فِي ٱلْحَيَاةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَمَتَّعْنَاهُمْ إِلَىٰ حِينٍ,If only there had been one town — meaning its inhabitants — that believed before chastisement befell it and profited by its belief — except for the people of Jonah when they believed after seeing a portent of the chastisement for they did not wait to believe until it came to pass We removed from upon them the chastisement of degradation in the life of this world and We gave them comfort for a while until the conclusion of their terms of life.
وَلَوْ شَآءَ رَبُّكَ لآمَنَ مَن فِي ٱلأَرْضِ كُلُّهُمْ جَمِيعاً أَفَأَنتَ تُكْرِهُ ٱلنَّاسَ حَتَّىٰ يَكُونُواْ مُؤْمِنِينَ,And if your Lord willed all who are in the earth would have believed together. Would you then compel people to do what God did not will that they do until they are believers? No!
وَمَا كَانَ لِنَفْسٍ أَن تُؤْمِنَ إِلاَّ بِإِذْنِ ٱللَّهِ وَيَجْعَلُ ٱلرِّجْسَ عَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ لاَ يَعْقِلُونَ,And it is not for any soul to believe save by the permission of God by His will and He causes abomination chastisement to fall upon those who have no understanding those who do not reflect upon God’s signs.
قُلِ ٱنظُرُواْ مَاذَا فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَمَا تُغْنِي ٱلآيَاتُ وَٱلنُّذُرُ عَن قَوْمٍ لاَّ يُؤْمِنُونَ,Say to the disbelievers of Mecca ‘Behold what is in the heavens and in the earth!’ of signs indicating God’s Oneness exalted be He. But signs and warners nudhur is the plural of nadhīr that is messengers do not avail a folk who will not believe according to God’s knowledge in other words these signs and warners will not benefit them.
فَهَلْ يَنتَظِرُونَ إِلاَّ مِثْلَ أَيَّامِ ٱلَّذِينَ خَلَوْاْ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ قُلْ فَٱنْتَظِرُوۤاْ إِنِّي مَعَكُمْ مِّنَ ٱلْمُنْتَظِرِينَ,What do they await when they deny you but the like of the days of those who passed away before them? of communities that is the like of chastisements that befell them. Say ‘Then await this I shall indeed be with you among the waiting’.
ثُمَّ نُنَجِّي رُسُلَنَا وَٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ كَذَلِكَ حَقّاً عَلَيْنَا نُنجِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,Then We shall deliver nunajjī the imperfect tense is being used to narrate a past situation Our messengers and the believers from the chastisement. In like manner to that deliverance it is incumbent upon Us to deliver the believers the Prophet s and his Companions when the time comes for chastising the idolaters.
قُلْ يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّاسُ إِن كُنتُمْ فِي شَكٍّ مِّن دِينِي فَلاَ أَعْبُدُ ٱلَّذِينَ تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ وَلَـٰكِنْ أَعْبُدُ ٱللَّهَ ٱلَّذِي يَتَوَفَّاكُمْ وَأُمِرْتُ أَنْ أَكُونَ مِنَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,Say ‘O people that is O people of Mecca if you are in doubt of my religion and whether it is true then know that I do not worship those whom you worship besides God that is worshipping other than Him — namely idols — for you have doubts concerning God; but I worship God Who will take you to Him Who will seize your souls and I have been commanded to be of the believers.
وَأَنْ أَقِمْ وَجْهَكَ لِلدِّينِ حَنِيفاً وَلاَ تَكُونَنَّ مِنَ ٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ,And it has been said to me “Set your purpose for religion as a hanīf inclining towards it and do not be of the idolaters;
وَلاَ تَدْعُ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ مَا لاَ يَنفَعُكَ وَلاَ يَضُرُّكَ فَإِن فَعَلْتَ فَإِنَّكَ إِذاً مِّنَ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ,and do not call upon do not worship besides God that which can neither profit you should you worship it nor hurt you should you not worship it; for if you do this hypothetically speaking then you will surely be of the evildoers.
وَإِن يَمْسَسْكَ ٱللَّهُ بِضُرٍّ فَلاَ كَاشِفَ لَهُ إِلاَّ هُوَ وَإِن يُرِدْكَ بِخَيْرٍ فَلاَ رَآدَّ لِفَضْلِهِ يُصَيبُ بِهِ مَن يَشَآءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ وَهُوَ ٱلْغَفُورُ ٱلرَّحِيمُ,And if God afflicts you smites you with some hurt such as impoverishment or illness there is none who can remove it save Him; and if He desires good for you there is none who can repel His bounty that bounty which He has intended for you. He strikes with it that is with such good whomever He will of His servants.” He is the Forgiving the Merciful’.
قُلْ يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّاسُ قَدْ جَآءَكُمُ ٱلْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّكُمْ فَمَنِ ٱهْتَدَىٰ فَإِنَّمَا يَهْتَدِي لِنَفْسِهِ وَمَن ضَلَّ فَإِنَّمَا يَضِلُّ عَلَيْهَا وَمَآ أَنَاْ عَلَيْكُمْ بِوَكِيلٍ,Say ‘O people that is people of Mecca the Truth has come to you from your Lord. So whoever is guided is guided only for the sake of his own soul since the reward of his being guided will be his and whoever errs errs only against it since the evil consequence of his erring shall befall only it his soul. And I am not a guardian over you’ that I might then compel you to accept guidance.
وَٱتَّبِعْ مَا يُوحَىٰ إِلَيْكَ وَٱصْبِرْ حَتَّىٰ يَحْكُمَ ٱللَّهُ وَهُوَ خَيْرُ ٱلْحَاكِمِينَ,And follow what is revealed to you from your Lord and endure patiently the Call and their hurting you until God give judgement concerning them by giving His command and He is the Best of Judges the fairest of them he the Prophet endured patiently until God judged that the idolaters be fought and that the People of the Scripture pay the jizya-tax.
الۤر كِتَابٌ أُحْكِمَتْ آيَاتُهُ ثُمَّ فُصِّلَتْ مِن لَّدُنْ حَكِيمٍ خَبِيرٍ,Alif lām rā’ God knows best what He means by these letters; this is a Book whose verses have been set clear through marvellous arrangement and wonderful meanings and then detailed expounded through rulings stories and admonitions from One Wise Informed that is from God.
أَلاَّ تَعْبُدُوۤاْ إِلاَّ ٱللَّهَ إِنَّنِي لَكُمْ مِّنْهُ نَذِيرٌ وَبَشِيرٌ,Saying ‘Worship none but God. Truly I am to you a warner from Him of chastisement if you disbelieve and a bearer of good tidings’ of reward if you believe.
وَأَنِ ٱسْتَغْفِرُواْ رَبَّكُمْ ثُمَّ تُوبُوۤاْ إِلَيْهِ يُمَتِّعْكُمْ مَّتَاعاً حَسَناً إِلَىٰ أَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّى وَيُؤْتِ كُلَّ ذِي فَضْلٍ فَضْلَهُ وَإِن تَوَلَّوْاْ فَإِنِّيۤ أَخَافُ عَلَيْكُمْ عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ كَبِيرٍ,And bidding you ‘Ask forgiveness of your Lord for your idolatry then repent return to Him through acts of obedience and He will give you in this world fair enjoyment in the way of pleasant living and abundant provision until a time appointed namely death and He will give in the Hereafter every person of merit in deed the due for his merit his reward. But if you turn away tawallaw one of the two tā’ letters of tatawallaw has been omitted in other words if you object I fear for you the chastisement of an awful day namely the Day of Resurrection.
إِلَى ٱللَّهِ مَرْجِعُكُمْ وَهُوَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,Unto God is your return and He has power over all things’ including reward and chastisement.
أَلا إِنَّهُمْ يَثْنُونَ صُدُورَهُمْ لِيَسْتَخْفُواْ مِنْهُ أَلا حِينَ يَسْتَغْشُونَ ثِيَابَهُمْ يَعْلَمُ مَا يُسِرُّونَ وَمَا يُعْلِنُونَ إِنَّهُ عَلِيمٌ بِذَاتِ ٱلصُّدُورِ,As reported by al-Bukhārī by way of an isnād from Ibn ‘Abbās the following was revealed regarding those who were embarrassed to withdraw to relieve nature or to have sexual intercourse without their clothes and become exposed to the heaven. It is also said that it was revealed regarding the hypocrites Lo! they fold up their breasts that they may hide from Him that is from God; lo! the moment they cover themselves with their garments wrapping themselves up therewith He God exalted be He knows what they keep hidden and what they proclaim and so their hiding is to no avail. Truly He knows what is in the breasts of men that is what is in the hearts.
وَمَا مِن دَآبَّةٍ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ إِلاَّ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ رِزْقُهَا وَيَعْلَمُ مُسْتَقَرَّهَا وَمُسْتَوْدَعَهَا كُلٌّ فِي كِتَابٍ مُّبِينٍ,And there is not wa-mā min min is extra a creature dābba is that creature which treads dabba in the earth but the sustenance thereof rests on God sustenance which He has undertaken to provide out of His bounty exalted be He. And He knows its habitation its dwelling-place in this world — or in the loins — and its repository after death or in the womb. All that which is mentioned is in a manifest a clear Book which is the Preserved Tablet al-lawh al-mahfūz.
وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِي خَلَق ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضَ فِي سِتَّةِ أَيَّامٍ وَكَانَ عَرْشُهُ عَلَى ٱلْمَآءِ لِيَبْلُوَكُمْ أَيُّكُمْ أَحْسَنُ عَمَلاً وَلَئِن قُلْتَ إِنَّكُمْ مَّبْعُوثُونَ مِن بَعْدِ ٱلْمَوْتِ لَيَقُولَنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوۤاْ إِنْ هَـٰذَآ إِلاَّ سِحْرٌ مُّبِينٌ,And He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in six days the first of which was Sunday and the last Friday — and His Throne before creating them was upon the water borne by the winds — that He might try you li-yabluwakum is semantically connected to khalaqa ‘He Who created’ in other words He created them and all that is beneficial and good for you in them in order to test you which of you is best in conduct that is which of you is most obedient to God. And if you were to say O Muhammad (s) to them ‘Truly you shall be raised again after death’ those who disbelieve will say ‘This Qur’ān that speaks of resurrection — or this that you are saying — is nothing but manifest clear sorcery’ sihrun a variant reading has sāhirun ‘sorcerer’ in which case the reference is to the Prophet s.
وَلَئِنْ أَخَّرْنَا عَنْهُمُ ٱلْعَذَابَ إِلَىٰ أُمَّةٍ مَّعْدُودَةٍ لَّيَقُولُنَّ مَا يَحْبِسُهُ أَلاَ يَوْمَ يَأْتِيهِمْ لَيْسَ مَصْرُوفاً عَنْهُمْ وَحَاقَ بِهِم مَّا كَانُواْ بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ,And if we postpone the chastisement for them until the arrival of a reckoned time reckoned moments they will surely say in mockery ‘What is detaining it?’ what is preventing it from being sent down? God exalted be He says Verily on the day when it comes to them it cannot be averted warded off from them and that chastisement which they derided shall surround them it shall come down upon them.
وَلَئِنْ أَذَقْنَا ٱلإِنْسَانَ مِنَّا رَحْمَةً ثُمَّ نَزَعْنَاهَا مِنْهُ إِنَّهُ لَيَئُوسٌ كَفُورٌ,And if We cause the disbelieving man to taste some mercy from Us such as wealth and good health and then wrest it from him lo! he is despairing having lost hope of God’s mercy ungrateful intensely ungrateful to Him.
وَلَئِنْ أَذَقْنَاهُ نَعْمَآءَ بَعْدَ ضَرَّآءَ مَسَّتْهُ لَيَقُولَنَّ ذَهَبَ ٱلسَّيِّئَاتُ عَنِّيۤ إِنَّهُ لَفَرِحٌ فَخُورٌ,But if We cause him to taste prosperity after some misery such as impoverishment and hardship that had befallen him assuredly he will say ‘The ills the afflictions have gone from me’ when he had not anticipated that they would go away; yet still he does not give thanks for this; lo! he is exultant wanton boastful to people of what he has been given;
إِلاَّ ٱلَّذِينَ صَبَرُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ لَهُمْ مَّغْفِرَةٌ وَأَجْرٌ كَبِيرٌ,save but those who endure misery patiently and perform righteous deeds during times of comfort; theirs will be forgiveness and a great reward which is Paradise.
فَلَعَلَّكَ تَارِكٌ بَعْضَ مَا يُوحَىٰ إِلَيْكَ وَضَآئِقٌ بِهِ صَدْرُكَ أَن يَقُولُواْ لَوْلاَ أُنزِلَ عَلَيْهِ كَنزٌ أَوْ جَآءَ مَعَهُ مَلَكٌ إِنَّمَآ أَنتَ نَذِيرٌ وَٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ وَكِيلٌ,Perhaps O Muhammad (s) you might think to leave out some of what is revealed to you such that you do not convey it to them for they do not take it seriously and that your breast should be straitened by it by reciting it to them because they say ‘Why has a treasure not been sent down for him or an angel not come with him?’ to confirm his sincerity as we had requested? You are but a warner and yours is only to convey the Message not to produce what they have requested; and God is Guardian over all things He is Preserver of all things so He will requite them accordingly.
أَمْ يَقُولُونَ ٱفْتَرَاهُ قُلْ فَأْتُواْ بِعَشْرِ سُوَرٍ مِّثْلِهِ مُفْتَرَيَٰتٍ وَٱدْعُواْ مَنِ ٱسْتَطَعْتُمْ مِّن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ إِن كُنتُمْ صَادِقِينَ,Or do they say ‘He has invented it’? that is the Qur’ān. Say ‘Then bring ten sūras the like thereof in terms of clarity and rhetorical excellence invented for you are Arabs who speak Arabic eloquently like myself — he challenged them to these ten sūras first and then to one sūra — and call in order for them to assist you upon whom you can beside God that is on other than Him if you are truthful’ about it the Qur’ān being an invention of lies.
فَإِلَّمْ يَسْتَجِيبُواْ لَكُمْ فَٱعْلَمُوۤاْ أَنَّمَآ أُنزِلَ بِعِلْمِ ٱللَّهِ وَأَن لاَّ إِلَـٰهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ فَهَلْ أَنتُمْ مُّسْلِمُونَ,Then if they that is those on whom you call for assistance do not answer you know this address is to the idolaters that it has been revealed enwrapped only in God’s knowledge not as an invention of lies against Him and that an is softened in other words understand it as annahu there is no god save Him. Will you then submit? after this definitive argument; in other words ‘Submit!’
مَن كَانَ يُرِيدُ ٱلْحَيَاةَ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَزِينَتَهَا نُوَفِّ إِلَيْهِمْ أَعْمَالَهُمْ فِيهَا وَهُمْ فِيهَا لاَ يُبْخَسُونَ,He who desires the life of this world and its adornment by persisting in idolatry — it is said that this was revealed regarding the dissimulators — We shall repay them their deeds that is the requital of any good that they did such as charity or kindness to kin in it by giving them abundant provision and therein that is in this world they shall not be defrauded they shall not be made to suffer diminution in anything.
أُوْلَـٰئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ لَيْسَ لَهُمْ فِي ٱلآخِرَةِ إِلاَّ ٱلنَّارُ وَحَبِطَ مَا صَنَعُواْ فِيهَا وَبَاطِلٌ مَّا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ,Those are they for whom there is nothing in the Hereafter but the Fire; what they contrive will have failed will be invalid therein that is in the Hereafter and will not be rewarded and useless is that which they used to do.
أَفَمَن كَانَ عَلَىٰ بَيِّنَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّهِ وَيَتْلُوهُ شَاهِدٌ مِّنْهُ وَمِن قَبْلِهِ كِتَابُ مُوسَىٰ إِمَاماً وَرَحْمَةً أُوْلَـٰئِكَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِهِ وَمَن يَكْفُرْ بِهِ مِنَ ٱلأَحْزَابِ فَٱلنَّارُ مَوْعِدُهُ فَلاَ تَكُ فِي مِرْيَةٍ مِّنْهُ إِنَّهُ ٱلْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّكَ وَلَـٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ ٱلنَّاسِ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ,Is he who relies on a clear proof a clear statement from his Lord meaning the Prophet s or the believers; it the proof being the Qur’ān a clear proof which is followed by a witness to it of its veracity as being from Him that is from God; he the witness being Gabriel and before it before the Qur’ān was the Book of Moses the Torah also a witness to it as an example and a mercy? imāman wa-rahmatan is a circumstantial qualifier is such a person like one who is not so? No! Those that is the ones who rely on a clear proof they believe in it that is in the Qur’ān and so for them will be Paradise; but he who disbelieves in it of the partisans namely all the disbelievers the Fire shall be his appointed place. So do not be in doubt in uncertainty concerning it concerning the Qur’ān. Truly it is the Truth from your Lord but most of mankind that is the people of Mecca do not believe.
وَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّنِ ٱفْتَرَىٰ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ كَذِباً أُوْلَـٰئِكَ يُعْرَضُونَ عَلَىٰ رَبِّهِمْ وَيَقُولُ ٱلأَشْهَادُ هَـٰؤُلاۤءِ ٱلَّذِينَ كَذَبُواْ عَلَىٰ رَبِّهِمْ أَلاَ لَعْنَةُ ٱللَّهِ عَلَى ٱلظَّالِمِينَ,And who that is none does greater wrong than he who invents a lie concerning God? by ascribing to Him partner and child. Those they shall be brought before their Lord on the Day of Resurrection amid the rest of creation and the witnesses ashhād is the plural of shāhid namely the angels who will bear witness that the messengers conveyed the Message and that the disbelievers denied them will say ‘These are they who lied concerning their Lord’. Surely the curse of God is upon the wrong-doers the idolaters;
ٱلَّذِينَ يَصُدُّونَ عَن سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ وَيَبْغُونَهَا عِوَجاً وَهُمْ بِٱلآخِرَةِ هُمْ كَافِرُونَ,they who bar people from God’s way from the religion of Islam desiring to have it seeking that the way be crooked; and in the Hereafter they hum ‘they’ is reiterated for emphasis are disbelievers.
أُولَـٰئِكَ لَمْ يَكُونُواْ مُعْجِزِينَ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَمَا كَانَ لَهُمْ مِّن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ مِنْ أَوْلِيَآءَ يُضَاعَفُ لَهُمُ ٱلْعَذَابُ مَا كَانُواْ يَسْتَطِيعُونَ ٱلسَّمْعَ وَمَا كَانُواْ يُبْصِرُونَ,Such will not escape God in the earth and beside God other than Him they can have no allies no helpers to protect them against His chastisement. For them the chastisement will be double for their having led others astray. They could not hear the truth nor did they use to see it; that is to say because of their extreme aversion to it it is as though they did not have the physical capacity for it.
أُوْلَـٰئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ خَسِرُوۤاْ أَنْفُسَهُمْ وَضَلَّ عَنْهُمْ مَّا كَانُواْ يَفْتَرُونَ,Such are they who have lost their souls for their journey’s end shall be to the Fire made everlasting for them; and that which they used to invent of lies concerning God in the way of claiming that He has a partner has failed them is absent before them.
لاَ جَرَمَ أَنَّهُمْ فِي ٱلآخِرَةِ هُمُ ٱلأَخْسَرُونَ,Without doubt verily they will be the greatest losers in the Hereafter.
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ وَأَخْبَتُوۤاْ إِلَىٰ رَبِّهِمْ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ أَصْحَابُ ٱلجَنَّةِ هُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ,Truly those who believe and perform righteous deeds and humble themselves who are at peace and feel reassured or who repent before their Lord such will be the inhabitants of Paradise abiding therein.
مَثَلُ ٱلْفَرِيقَيْنِ كَٱلأَعْمَىٰ وَٱلأَصَمِّ وَٱلْبَصِيرِ وَٱلسَّمِيعِ هَلْ يَسْتَوِيَانِ مَثَلاً أَفَلاَ تَذَكَّرُونَ,The likeness the description of the two parties the disbelievers and the believers is as the blind and the deaf this being the likeness of the disbeliever and the one who sees and the one who hears this being the likeness of the believer are they equal in likeness? No! Will you not then remember? tadhakkarūn the original tā’ of tatadhakkarūn has been assimilated with the dhāl will you not then be admonished?
وَلَقَدْ أَرْسَلْنَا نُوحاً إِلَىٰ قَوْمِهِ إِنَّي لَكُمْ نَذِيرٌ مُّبِينٌ,And verily We sent Noah to his people and he said ‘I am annī a variant reading has innī in which case ‘he said’ has been omitted for you a clear warner one whose warning is plain.
أَن لاَّ تَعْبُدُوۤاْ إِلاَّ ٱللَّهَ إِنِّيۤ أَخَافُ عَلَيْكُمْ عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ أَلِيمٍ,That you worship none but God. Lo! I fear for you should you worship other than Him the chastisement of a painful day’ painful in this world and in the Hereafter.
فَقَالَ ٱلْمَلأُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِن قِوْمِهِ مَا نَرَاكَ إِلاَّ بَشَراً مِّثْلَنَا وَمَا نَرَاكَ ٱتَّبَعَكَ إِلاَّ ٱلَّذِينَ هُمْ أَرَاذِلُنَا بَادِيَ ٱلرَّأْيِ وَمَا نَرَىٰ لَكُمْ عَلَيْنَا مِن فَضْلٍ بَلْ نَظُنُّكُمْ كَاذِبِينَ,The council the respected elders of his people who disbelieved said ‘We see you but a mortal like us and you have no merit over us and we see not that any follow you save the vilest among us the riffraff among us such as the weavers and the shoemakers through rash opinion bādiya’l-ra’ya read with hamza or without in both cases in other words impulsively without thinking you over it bādiya’l-ra’ya is in the accusative because it is an adverbial clause that is to say at the time that their opinion first came into being. We do not see that you have any merit over us for which you would deserve our following you; nay we deem you liars’ with regard to your claim to be bringing a Message they the disbelievers included his folk with him in their address to him.
قَالَ يٰقَوْمِ أَرَأَيْتُمْ إِن كُنتُ عَلَىٰ بَيِّنَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّيۤ وَآتَانِي رَحْمَةً مِّنْ عِندِهِ فَعُمِّيَتْ عَلَيْكُمْ أَنُلْزِمُكُمُوهَا وَأَنتُمْ لَهَا كَارِهُونَ,He said ‘O my people have you considered — inform me — if I am acting upon a clear proof a clear statement from my Lord and He has given me mercy — prophethood — from Him and it has been obscured concealed from you ‘amiyat ‘obscured’ a variant reading has the passive ‘ummiyat can we compel you to it are we able to force you to accept it while you are averse to it? We are not able to do that.
وَيٰقَوْمِ لاۤ أَسْأَلُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ مَالاً إِنْ أَجْرِيَ إِلاَّ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ وَمَآ أَنَاْ بِطَارِدِ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُوۤاْ إِنَّهُمْ مُّلاَقُواْ رَبِّهِمْ وَلَـٰكِنِّيۤ أَرَاكُمْ قَوْماً تَجْهَلُونَ,And O my people I do not ask of you any wealth which you should give me for this for conveying the Message. My wage my reward falls only upon God and I will not drive away those who believe as you have commanded me; they shall surely meet their Lord at the Resurrection and He will requite them and exact vengeance for them from those who wronged them and drove them away. But I see you are a people who are ignorant of the consequence of your affair.
وَيٰقَوْمِ مَن يَنصُرُنِي مِنَ ٱللَّهِ إِن طَرَدتُّهُمْ أَفَلاَ تَذَكَّرُونَ,And O my people who would help who would defend me against God that is against His chastisement if I drive them away? in other words there is none to help me. Will you not then remember? tadhakkarūn the original second tā’ in tatadhakkarūn has been assimilated with the dhāl will you not then be admonished?
وَلاَ أَقُولُ لَكُمْ عِندِي خَزَآئِنُ ٱللَّهِ وَلاَ أَعْلَمُ ٱلْغَيْبَ وَلاَ أَقُولُ إِنِّي مَلَكٌ وَلاَ أَقُولُ لِلَّذِينَ تَزْدَرِيۤ أَعْيُنُكُمْ لَن يُؤْتِيَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ خَيْراً ٱللَّهُ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا فِيۤ أَنْفُسِهِمْ إِنِّيۤ إِذاً لَّمِنَ ٱلظَّٰلِمِينَ,And I do not say to you “I possess the treasure houses of God” nor “I have knowledge of the Unseen”; nor do I say “I am an angel” nay I am human like you. Nor do I say to those whom your eyes scorn that God will not give them any good — God knows best what is in their souls in their hearts. Lo! if I were to say this then indeed I would be of the evildoers’.
قَالُواْ يٰنُوحُ قَدْ جَادَلْتَنَا فَأَكْثَرْتَ جِدَالَنَا فَأْتِنَا بِمَا تَعِدُنَآ إِن كُنتَ مِنَ ٱلصَّادِقِينَ,They said ‘O Noah you have disputed with us and disputed with us at length so bring upon us that wherewith you are threatening us in the way of chastisement if you are of the truthful’.
قَالَ إِنَّمَا يَأْتِيكُمْ بِهِ ٱللَّهُ إِن شَآءَ وَمَآ أَنتُمْ بِمُعْجِزِينَ,He said ‘Only God will bring it upon you if He wills to hasten it on for you for the decision is His not mine; and you cannot escape Him elude God.
وَلاَ يَنفَعُكُمْ نُصْحِيۤ إِنْ أَرَدْتُّ أَنْ أَنصَحَ لَكُمْ إِن كَانَ ٱللَّهُ يُرِيدُ أَن يُغْوِيَكُمْ هُوَ رَبُّكُمْ وَإِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ,And my counsel will not benefit you if I desire to counsel you when God desires to keep you astray the response to the conditional is indicated by wa-lā yanfa‘ukum nushī ‘and my counsel will not benefit you’. He is your Lord and to Him you will be brought back’.
أَمْ يَقُولُونَ ٱفْتَرَاهُ قُلْ إِنِ ٱفْتَرَيْتُهُ فَعَلَيَّ إِجْرَامِي وَأَنَاْ بَرِيۤءٌ مِّمَّا تُجْرِمُونَ,God exalted be He says Or do they the disbelievers of Mecca say ‘He has invented it’? Muhammad (s) has invented the Qur’ān? Say ‘If I have invented it then my crime will be upon me my sin will be upon me that is the punishment for it; and I am innocent of what you commit’ of crime when you attribute invention to me.
وَأُوحِيَ إِلَىٰ نُوحٍ أَنَّهُ لَن يُؤْمِنَ مِن قَوْمِكَ إِلاَّ مَن قَدْ آمَنَ فَلاَ تَبْتَئِسْ بِمَا كَانُواْ يَفْعَلُونَ,And it was revealed to Noah that ‘None of your people will believe except he who has already believed. Do not be distressed grieved because of what they do in the way of idolatry. So he Noah invoked God against them with the words My Lord leave not one of the disbelievers upon the earth Q. 7126. God responded to this invocation of his and said
وَٱصْنَعِ ٱلْفُلْكَ بِأَعْيُنِنَا وَوَحْيِنَا وَلاَ تُخَاطِبْنِي فِي ٱلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوۤاْ إِنَّهُمْ مُّغْرَقُونَ,Build the Ark the ship under Our eyes under Our watch and protection and by Our inspiration by Our command and do not address Me concerning those who have done evil those who have disbelieved by asking that I should refrain from destroying them; lo! they shall be drowned’.
وَيَصْنَعُ ٱلْفُلْكَ وَكُلَّمَا مَرَّ عَلَيْهِ مَلأٌ مِّن قَوْمِهِ سَخِرُواْ مِنْهُ قَالَ إِن تَسْخَرُواْ مِنَّا فَإِنَّا نَسْخَرُ مِنكُمْ كَمَا تَسْخَرُونَ,And he was building the Ark yasna‘ is narrating a past state in the present tense and whenever a council a group of his people passed him they scoffed at him mocked him. He said ‘Though you scoff at us yet we scoff at you even as you scoff when we are saved while you drown;
فَسَوْفَ تَعْلَمُونَ مَن يَأْتِيهِ عَذَابٌ يُخْزِيهِ وَيَحِلُّ عَلَيْهِ عَذَابٌ مُّقِيمٌ,and you shall know to whom man introduces the relative clause which constitutes the direct object of the action of ‘knowing’ will come a chastisement degrading him and upon whom an enduring an everlasting chastisement will fall’.
حَتَّىٰ إِذَا جَآءَ أَمْرُنَا وَفَارَ ٱلتَّنُّورُ قُلْنَا ٱحْمِلْ فِيهَا مِن كُلٍّ زَوْجَيْنِ ٱثْنَيْنِ وَأَهْلَكَ إِلاَّ مَن سَبَقَ عَلَيْهِ ٱلْقَوْلُ وَمَنْ آمَنَ وَمَآ آمَنَ مَعَهُ إِلاَّ قَلِيلٌ,Such that when hattā represents the objective for the action of ‘building’ Our command came for their destruction and the baker’s oven gushed forth with water — this was the sign for Noah — We said ‘Load therein in the ship of every kind of every male and female that is of every species of these two two a male and a female ithnayn constitutes the direct object. According to the story God gathered for Noah all the beasts of prey and birds and other animals; he Noah would go through every species to select them with his hands and his right hand would fall upon a male and the left upon a female whereupon he would take them aboard the ship; and your family — that is his wife and children — save those against whom the Word has already gone forth from among them that they be destroyed this was his wife and his son Canaan in contrast with Shem Ham and Japheth whom he took aboard together with their three wives and those who believe’. And none but a few believed with him it is said that these were six men and their wives; it is also said that the number of all those aboard the ship was eighty half of whom were men and the other half women.
وَقَالَ ٱرْكَبُواْ فِيهَا بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ مَجْريٰهَا وَمُرْسَاهَا إِنَّ رَبِّي لَغَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,And he Noah said ‘Embark therein! In the Name of God be its course and its mooring read majrāhā and marsāhā or mujrāhā and mursāhā both being verbal nouns meaning the length of its course and where it docks in other words the entire journey. Truly my Lord is Forgiving Merciful’ for He did not destroy us.
وَهِيَ تَجْرِي بِهِمْ فِي مَوْجٍ كَٱلْجِبَالِ وَنَادَىٰ نُوحٌ ٱبْنَهُ وَكَانَ فِي مَعْزِلٍ يٰبُنَيَّ ٱرْكَبَ مَّعَنَا وَلاَ تَكُن مَّعَ ٱلْكَافِرِينَ,And it sailed with them amid waves like mountains in terms of their height and size and Noah called out to his son Canaan who was standing away from the ship ‘O my son embark with us and do not be with the disbelievers!’
قَالَ سَآوِيۤ إِلَىٰ جَبَلٍ يَعْصِمُنِي مِنَ ٱلْمَآءِ قَالَ لاَ عَاصِمَ ٱلْيَوْمَ مِنْ أَمْرِ ٱللَّهِ إِلاَّ مَن رَّحِمَ وَحَالَ بَيْنَهُمَا ٱلْمَوْجُ فَكَانَ مِنَ ٱلْمُغْرَقِينَ,He said ‘I shall take refuge in a mountain that will protect me preserve me from the water’. Said he ‘This day there is none that can protect from God’s command from His chastisement except — but — him on whom He God has mercy’ he will be protected. God exalted be He says And the waves came between them so he was among the drowned.
وَقِيلَ يٰأَرْضُ ٱبْلَعِي مَآءَكِ وَيٰسَمَآءُ أَقْلِعِي وَغِيضَ ٱلْمَآءُ وَقُضِيَ ٱلأَمْرُ وَٱسْتَوَتْ عَلَى ٱلْجُودِيِّ وَقِيلَ بُعْداً لِّلْقَوْمِ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ,And it was said ‘O earth swallow your waters that have sprung forth from you — and it reabsorbed it all except for what came down from the sky and formed rivers and seas — and O heaven abate!’ withhold the rain and it did. And the waters subsided decreased. And the affair was accomplished the matter of the destruction of Noah’s people was complete and it settled and the ship came to rest upon al-Jūdī a mountain in Mespotamia al-jazīra near Mosul; and it was said ‘Away with — perish — the evildoing the disbelieving folk!’
وَنَادَى نُوحٌ رَّبَّهُ فَقَالَ رَبِّ إِنَّ ٱبْنِي مِنْ أَهْلِي وَإِنَّ وَعْدَكَ ٱلْحَقُّ وَأَنتَ أَحْكَمُ ٱلْحَاكِمِينَ,And Noah called out to his Lord and said ‘My Lord lo! my son Canaan is of my family and You promised me that they would be saved and truly Your promise is the Truth which never fails and You are the Most Just of Judges’ the most knowledgeable and the fairest of them.
قَالَ يٰنُوحُ إِنَّهُ لَيْسَ مِنْ أَهْلِكَ إِنَّهُ عَمَلٌ غَيْرُ صَالِحٍ فَلاَ تَسْئَلْنِ مَا لَيْسَ لَكَ بِهِ عِلْمٌ إِنِّيۤ أَعِظُكَ أَن تَكُونَ مِنَ ٱلْجَاهِلِينَ,He God exalted be He said ‘O Noah lo! he is not of your family of those who will be saved or of the followers of your religion; lo! it that is your asking me to save him is not a righteous deed for he is a disbeliever and there is no deliverance for disbelievers ‘āmalun ghayru sālihin ‘it is not a righteous deed’ a variant reading has ‘āmila the verb with ghayra in the accusative in which case the person governing the verb ‘amila is his son. So do not ask of Me read either fa-lā tas’alanni or fa-lā tas’alni that whereof you have no knowledge in respect to saving your son. I admonish you lest you be among the ignorant’ when you ask about what you do not know.
قَالَ رَبِّ إِنِّيۤ أَعُوذُ بِكَ أَنْ أَسْأَلَكَ مَا لَيْسَ لِي بِهِ عِلْمٌ وَإِلاَّ تَغْفِرْ لِي وَتَرْحَمْنِيۤ أَكُن مِّنَ ٱلْخَاسِرِينَ,He said ‘My Lord I seek refuge in You from the sin that I should ask of You that whereof I have no knowledge. Unless You forgive me my excess and have mercy on me I shall be among the losers’.
قِيلَ يٰنُوحُ ٱهْبِطْ بِسَلاَمٍ مِّنَّا وَبَركَاتٍ عَلَيْكَ وَعَلَىٰ أُمَمٍ مِّمَّن مَّعَكَ وَأُمَمٌ سَنُمَتِّعُهُمْ ثُمَّ يَمَسُّهُمْ مِّنَّا عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,It was said ‘O Noah go down disembark from the ship in peace in safety or with a greeting from Us and blessings good things upon you and upon some communities that will spring from those with you in the ship that is from their children and their seed those who are and those who will be the believers. And there will be other communities read umamun to spring from those with you to whom We shall give enjoyment in this world and then a painful chastisement will befall them’ in the Hereafter and these will be the disbelievers.
تِلْكَ مِنْ أَنْبَآءِ ٱلْغَيْبِ نُوحِيهَآ إِلَيْكَ مَا كُنتَ تَعْلَمُهَآ أَنتَ وَلاَ قَوْمُكَ مِن قَبْلِ هَـٰذَا فَٱصْبِرْ إِنَّ ٱلْعَاقِبَةَ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ,Those that is these verses containing stories such as the story of Noah are of the tidings of the Unseen of the tales of that which was hidden from you which We inspire in you O Muhammad (s). You yourself did not know it nor did your people know it before this Qur’ān. So be patient in conveying the Message and in enduring your people’s hurt as Noah endured. Truly the praiseworthy sequel is for those who are God-fearing.
وَإِلَىٰ عَادٍ أَخَاهُمْ هُوداً قَالَ يٰقَوْمِ ٱعْبُدُواْ ٱللَّهَ مَا لَكُمْ مِّنْ إِلَـٰهٍ غَيْرُهُ إِنْ أَنتُمْ إِلاَّ مُفْتَرُونَ,And We sent to ‘Ād their brother from the tribe Hūd. He said ‘O my people worship God! affirm His Oneness. You have no god min ilāhin min is extra other than He. You in your worship of graven images do but invent you do but invent lies against God.
يٰقَوْمِ لاۤ أَسْأَلُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ أَجْراً إِنْ أَجْرِيَ إِلاَّ عَلَى ٱلَّذِي فَطَرَنِيۤ أَفَلاَ تَعْقِلُونَ,O my people I do not ask of you any wage for it for the affirmation of His Oneness. Lo! my wage falls only upon Him Who originated me created me. Will you not understand?
وَيٰقَوْمِ ٱسْتَغْفِرُواْ رَبَّكُمْ ثُمَّ تُوبُوۤاْ إِلَيْهِ يُرْسِلِ ٱلسَّمَآءَ عَلَيْكُمْ مِّدْرَاراً وَيَزِدْكُمْ قُوَّةً إِلَىٰ قُوَّتِكُمْ وَلاَ تَتَوَلَّوْاْ مُجْرِمِينَ,And O my people ask forgiveness of your Lord for your idolatry then turn return to Him repentant through obedience; He will release the sky He will release the rain — for they had been denied it — upon you in abundance with abundant rainfall and He will add to you strength to your strength through wealth and children. Do not turn away as sinners’ idolaters.
قَالُواْ يٰهُودُ مَا جِئْتَنَا بِبَيِّنَةٍ وَمَا نَحْنُ بِتَارِكِيۤ آلِهَتِنَا عَن قَوْلِكَ وَمَا نَحْنُ لَكَ بِمُؤْمِنِينَ,They said ‘O Hūd you have not brought us any clear proof any evidence for what you say and we are not going to forsake our gods on the basis of your saying that is because of what you say and we are not believers in you.
إِن نَّقُولُ إِلاَّ ٱعْتَرَاكَ بَعْضُ آلِهَتِنَا بِسُوۤءٍ قَالَ إِنِّيۤ أُشْهِدُ ٱللَّهَ وَٱشْهَدُوۤاْ أَنِّي بَرِيۤءٌ مِّمَّا تُشْرِكُونَ,We say nothing concerning you save that one of our gods has possessed you in some evil way’ rendering you insane for your having cursed them and so you are raving. He said ‘Lo! I call God to bear witness for me and you bear witness also that I am innocent of what you associate with Him
مِن دُونِهِ فَكِيدُونِي جَمِيعاً ثُمَّ لاَ تُنظِرُونِ,beside Him; so plot against me devise ways to destroy me all together you and your graven images then give me no respite grant me no reprieve.
إِنِّي تَوَكَّلْتُ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ رَبِّي وَرَبِّكُمْ مَّا مِن دَآبَّةٍ إِلاَّ هُوَ آخِذٌ بِنَاصِيَتِهَآ إِنَّ رَبِّي عَلَىٰ صِرَاطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ,Truly I have put my trust in God my Lord and your Lord; there is no mā min min is extra creature no living thing that treads upon this earth but He takes it by the forelock that is but He is its possessor and subjugator so that no benefit or harm occurs except by His permission — the forelock is specifically used here because he who is taken by his forelock suffers the ultimate humiliation. Surely my Lord is on a straight path that is on the way of truth and justice.
فَإِن تَوَلَّوْاْ فَقَدْ أَبْلَغْتُكُمْ مَّآ أُرْسِلْتُ بِهِ إِلَيْكُمْ وَيَسْتَخْلِفُ رَبِّي قَوْماً غَيْرَكُمْ وَلاَ تَضُرُّونَهُ شَيْئاً إِنَّ رَبِّي عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ حَفِيظٌ,And if you turn away tawallaw one of the two tā’ letters of tatawallaw has been omitted that is if you object still I have conveyed to you that wherewith I was sent to you and my Lord will set in place of you a folk other than you. You cannot injure Him in any way by your idolatry. Truly My Lord is Preserver Watcher over all things’.
وَلَمَّا جَآءَ أَمْرُنَا نَجَّيْنَا هُوداً وَٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ مَعَهُ بِرَحْمَةٍ مِّنَّا وَنَجَّيْنَاهُمْ مِّنْ عَذَابٍ غَلِيظٍ,And when Our command Our chastisement came to pass We delivered Hūd and those who believed with him by a mercy by guidance from Us and We delivered them from a harsh a severe chastisement.
وَتِلْكَ عَادٌ جَحَدُواْ بِآيَاتِ رَبِّهِمْ وَعَصَوْاْ رُسُلَهُ وَٱتَّبَعُوۤاْ أَمْرَ كُلِّ جَبَّارٍ عَنِيدٍ,And that was ‘Ād — this is an allusion to their remains; in other words go forth in the land and look at these remains. God then describes their case saying they knowingly denied the signs of their Lord and disobeyed His messengers rusulahu is in the plural because when a person disobeys a messenger he has effectively disobeyed all of them since they share a common principle in that Message with which they come namely the principle of God’s Oneness; and they that is the riffraff followed the command of every rebellious tyrant every leader of theirs who is obstinate with regard to the truth.
وَأُتْبِعُواْ فِي هَـٰذِهِ ٱلدُّنْيَا لَعْنَةً وَيَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ أَلاۤ إِنَّ عَاداً كَفَرُواْ رَبَّهُمْ أَلاَ بُعْداً لِّعَادٍ قَوْمِ هُودٍ,And a curse was made to follow them in this world from people and on the Day of Resurrection a curse will follow them for all creatures to see. ‘Lo! ‘Ād disbelieved in they knowingly denied their Lord. Lo! away far from God’s mercy with ‘Ād the folk of Hūd!’
وَإِلَىٰ ثَمُودَ أَخَاهُمْ صَالِحاً قَالَ يٰقَوْمِ ٱعْبُدُواْ ٱللَّهَ مَا لَكُمْ مِّنْ إِلَـٰهٍ غَيْرُهُ هُوَ أَنشَأَكُمْ مِّنَ ٱلأَرْضِ وَٱسْتَعْمَرَكُمْ فِيهَا فَٱسْتَغْفِرُوهُ ثُمَّ تُوبُوۤاْ إِلَيْهِ إِنَّ رَبِّي قَرِيبٌ مُّجِيبٌ,And We sent to Thamūd their brother from the tribe Sālih. He said ‘O my people worship God! affirm His Oneness. You have no god other than He. He it is Who produced you Who began your creation from the earth by creating your father Adam from it and has given you to live therein He has made you inhabitants living therein; so ask forgiveness of Him from idolatry then turn return to Him repentant through acts of obedience. Truly my Lord is Near to His creation by virtue of His knowledge Responsive’ to those who ask of Him.
قَالُواْ يٰصَالِحُ قَدْ كُنتَ فِينَا مَرْجُوّاً قَبْلَ هَـٰذَا أَتَنْهَانَآ أَن نَّعْبُدَ مَا يَعْبُدُ آبَاؤُنَا وَإِنَّنَا لَفِي شَكٍّ مِّمَّا تَدْعُونَآ إِلَيْهِ مُرِيبٍ,They said ‘O Sālih you had been one of promise among us that is to say we had hoped that you would become our chief before this that has issued from you. Do you forbid us to worship what our fathers worshipped? in the way of graven images? Truly we are in grave doubt doubt creating great uncertainty concerning that to which you are calling us’ in the way of affirming God’s Oneness.
قَالَ يٰقَوْمِ أَرَأَيْتُمْ إِن كُنتُ عَلَىٰ بَيِّنَةً مِّن رَّبِّي وَآتَانِي مِنْهُ رَحْمَةً فَمَن يَنصُرُنِي مِنَ ٱللَّهِ إِنْ عَصَيْتُهُ فَمَا تَزِيدُونَنِي غَيْرَ تَخْسِيرٍ,He said ‘O my people have you considered if I am acting upon a clear proof a clear statement from my Lord and He has given me from Him mercy prophethood who will help me who will defend me against God against His chastisement if I disobey Him? You would only be adding by commanding me to do that to my loss my misguidance.
وَيٰقَوْمِ هَـٰذِهِ نَاقَةُ ٱللَّهِ لَكُمْ آيَةً فَذَرُوهَا تَأْكُلْ فِيۤ أَرْضِ ٱللَّهِ وَلاَ تَمَسُّوهَا بِسُوۤءٍ فَيَأْخُذَكُمْ عَذَابٌ قَرِيبٌ,And O my people this is the she-camel of God a sign for you āyatan is a circumstantial qualifier operated by the demonstrative noun hādhihi ‘this’. Leave her to eat in God’s earth and do not cause her any harm by hamstringing her lest you be seized by a near chastisement’ if you do hamstring her.
فَعَقَرُوهَا فَقَالَ تَمَتَّعُواْ فِي دَارِكُمْ ثَلاَثَةَ أَيَّامٍ ذٰلِكَ وَعْدٌ غَيْرُ مَكْذُوبٍ,But they hamstrung her Qudār hamstrung her at their command and he Sālih said ‘Enjoy yourselves live in your dwellings for three days whereafter you will be destroyed. That is a promise that will not be belied’.
فَلَمَّا جَآءَ أَمْرُنَا نَجَّيْنَا صَالِحاً وَٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ مَعَهُ بِرَحْمَةٍ مِّنَّا وَمِنْ خِزْيِ يَوْمِئِذٍ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ هُوَ ٱلْقَوِيُّ ٱلْعَزِيزُ,So when Our command came for their destruction We delivered Sālih and those who believed with him they numbered 4000 by a mercy from Us and We delivered them from the ignominy of that day read yawmi’idhin if understood as declinable or read yawma’idhin on the basis of it yawm ‘day’ being annexed to an invariable idhin ‘that’ which is the majority view. Truly your Lord is the Strong the Mighty the Victor.
وَأَخَذَ ٱلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ ٱلصَّيْحَةُ فَأَصْبَحُواْ فِي دِيَارِهِمْ جَاثِمِينَ,And those who did evil were seized by the Cry so that they ended up lying lifeless prostrate in their habitations keeled over their knees dead
كَأَن لَّمْ يَغْنَوْاْ فِيهَآ أَلاَ إِنَّ ثَمُودَ كَفرُواْ رَبَّهُمْ أَلاَ بُعْداً لِّثَمُودَ,as if ka-an had been softened and its subject omitted in other words understand it as ka’annahum they had not dwelt there in their dwelling-place ‘Lo! Thamūd disbelieved in their Lord lo! away with Thamūd!’ this may be read declined li-Thamūdan or left as indeclinable li-Thamūda referring to the district or the tribe.
وَلَقَدْ جَآءَتْ رُسُلُنَآ إِبْرَاهِيمَ بِٱلْبُـشْرَىٰ قَالُواْ سَلاَماً قَالَ سَلاَمٌ فَمَا لَبِثَ أَن جَآءَ بِعِجْلٍ حَنِيذٍ,And verily Our messengers came to Abraham with good tidings of the birth of Isaac and after him Jacob. They said ‘Peace!’ salāman is a verbal noun. He said ‘Peace!’ be upon you and did not delay to bring a roasted calf.
فَلَمَّا رَأَى أَيْدِيَهُمْ لاَ تَصِلُ إِلَيْهِ نَكِرَهُمْ وَأَوْجَسَ مِنْهُمْ خِيفَةً قَالُواْ لاَ تَخَفْ إِنَّا أُرْسِلْنَا إِلَىٰ قَوْمِ لُوطٍ,And when he saw their hands not reaching to it he was suspicious of them and conceived he kept secret in himself a fear of them. They said ‘Fear not. Lo! we have been sent to the people of Lot’ to destroy them.
وَٱمْرَأَتُهُ قَآئِمَةٌ فَضَحِكَتْ فَبَشَّرْنَاهَا بِإِسْحَاقَ وَمِن وَرَآءِ إِسْحَاقَ يَعْقُوبَ,And his wife that is Abraham’s wife Sarah standing by serving them laughed at the good tiding of their destruction; and so We gave her the good tiding of Isaac and after Isaac of Jacob his son whom she would live to see.
قَالَتْ يَٰوَيْلَتَىٰ ءَأَلِدُ وَأَنَاْ عَجُوزٌ وَهَـٰذَا بَعْلِي شَيْخاً إِنَّ هَـٰذَا لَشَيْءٌ عَجِيبٌ,She said ‘Woe to me! yā waylatā is an expression used in reaction to a serious matter; the alif suffixed in waylatā substitutes for the yā’ of the genitive annexation waylatī ‘my woe’. Shall I bear a child when I am an old woman 99 years old and this my husband is an old man? 100 or 120 years old shaykhan is in the accusative because it is a circumstantial qualifier operated by the demonstrative import of dhā ‘this’. Truly this is a strange thing’ that a child should be born to such an aged couple.
قَالُوۤاْ أَتَعْجَبِينَ مِنْ أَمْرِ ٱللَّهِ رَحْمَتُ ٱللَّهِ وَبَرَكَاتُهُ عَلَيْكُمْ أَهْلَ ٱلْبَيْتِ إِنَّهُ حَمِيدٌ مَّجِيدٌ,They said ‘Are you astonished by God’s command? by His power? The mercy of God and His blessings be upon you O people of the House! the House of Abraham. Truly He is Praised Glorious!’ Generous.
فَلَمَّا ذَهَبَ عَنْ إِبْرَاهِيمَ ٱلرَّوْعُ وَجَآءَتْهُ ٱلْبُشْرَىٰ يُجَادِلُنَا فِي قَوْمِ لُوطٍ,And when the awe the fear departed from Abraham and the good tiding came to him of a child he began to plead with Us pleading with Our messengers concerning the matter of the people of Lot.
إِنَّ إِبْرَاهِيمَ لَحَلِيمٌ أَوَّاهٌ مُّنِيبٌ,Assuredly Abraham was forbearing long-suffering imploring penitent always returning to God in repentance thus he said to them ‘Would you destroy a town in which there are 300 believers?’ They said ‘No’. He said ‘Would you destroy a town in which there are 200 believers?’ They said ‘No’. He said ‘Would you destroy a town in which there are 40 believers?’ They said ‘No’. He said ‘Would you destroy a town in which there are 14 believers?’ They said ‘No’. He said ‘What if there were one believer in it?’ They said ‘No’. He said ‘Lot is in it’. They said ‘We know full well who is in it’ … to the end of the narrative.
يَٰإِبْرَٰهِيمُ أَعْرِضْ عَنْ هَـٰذَآ إِنَّهُ قَدْ جَآءَ أَمْرُ رَبِّكَ وَإِنَّهُمْ آتِيهِمْ عَذَابٌ غَيْرُ مَرْدُودٍ,When he had pleaded with them at length they said ‘O Abraham desist from this pleading. Truly your Lord’s command for their destruction has gone forth and truly there will come upon them a chastisement which cannot be repelled’.
وَلَمَّا جَآءَتْ رُسُلُنَا لُوطاً سِيۤءَ بِهِمْ وَضَاقَ بِهِمْ ذَرْعاً وَقَالَ هَـٰذَا يَوْمٌ عَصِيبٌ,And when Our messengers came to Lot he was distressed he was grieved on their account and felt constrained in his power to protect them because they had handsome faces and were dressed as visiting guests and so he feared for them from his people and he said ‘This is a distressful a very difficult day’.
وَجَآءَهُ قَوْمُهُ يُهْرَعُونَ إِلَيْهِ وَمِن قَبْلُ كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ ٱلسَّيِّئَاتِ قَالَ يٰقَوْمِ هَـٰؤُلاۤءِ بَنَاتِي هُنَّ أَطْهَرُ لَكُمْ فَاتَّقُواْ اللًّهَ وَلاَ تُخْزُونِ فِي ضَيْفِي أَلَيْسَ مِنْكُمْ رَجُلٌ رَّشِيدٌ,And his people when they became aware of them came to him running hastening towards him — and previously before they came they had been committing abominations namely penetrative sexual intercourse with men. He Lot said ‘O my people! Here are my daughters marry with them; they are purer for you. So fear God and do not degrade me do not disgrace me before my guests. Is there not among you any upright man?’ to enjoin decency and forbid indecency?
قَالُواْ لَقَدْ عَلِمْتَ مَا لَنَا فِي بَنَاتِكَ مِنْ حَقٍّ وَإِنَّكَ لَتَعْلَمُ مَا نُرِيدُ,They said ‘You know full well that we have no right to no need of your daughters and you know well what we desire’ in the way of sexual intercourse with men.
قَالَ لَوْ أَنَّ لِي بِكُمْ قُوَّةً أَوْ آوِيۤ إِلَىٰ رُكْنٍ شَدِيدٍ,He said ‘Would that I had strength power to resist you or could resort to some strong support!’ to some clan that would help me I would surely fall upon you. So when the angels saw this
قَالُواْ يٰلُوطُ إِنَّا رُسُلُ رَبِّكَ لَن يَصِلُوۤاْ إِلَيْكَ فَأَسْرِ بِأَهْلِكَ بِقِطْعٍ مِّنَ ٱلْلَّيْلِ وَلاَ يَلْتَفِتْ مِنكُمْ أَحَدٌ إِلاَّ ٱمْرَأَتَكَ إِنَّهُ مُصِيبُهَا مَآ أَصَابَهُمْ إِنَّ مَوْعِدَهُمُ ٱلصُّبْحُ أَلَيْسَ ٱلصُّبْحُ بِقَرِيبٍ,they said ‘O Lot truly we are messengers of your Lord. They shall not reach you with any harm so travel with your family during a part of the night and let not one of you turn round lest they see the terrible predicament that will befall them except for your wife read illā imra’atuka in the nominative as a substitute for ahadun; a variant reading has illā imra’ataka in the accusative as her being an exception among his ‘family’ in other words do no take her along when you travel lo! she shall be smitten by that which smites them it is said that he did not take her along with him; it is also said that she did set out with them and turned round and so exclaimed ‘Woe is my people!’ at which point a stone struck her and killed her. When he Lot asked them about the time of their destruction they replied Truly their tryst is for the morning and when he said ‘I want it to be sooner’ they said is the morning not nigh enough?’
فَلَمَّا جَآءَ أَمْرُنَا جَعَلْنَا عَالِيَهَا سَافِلَهَا وَأَمْطَرْنَا عَلَيْهَا حِجَارَةً مِّن سِجِّيلٍ مَّنْضُودٍ,So when Our command for their destruction came to pass We made their uppermost that is their cities the nethermost — when Gabriel raised them to the sky and dropped them upside down to the earth and We rained upon them stones of baked clay clay baked in fire one after another
مُّسَوَّمَةً عِندَ رَبِّكَ وَمَا هِيَ مِنَ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ بِبَعِيدٍ,marked each one of them with the name of the person it would strike with your Lord ‘inda rabbik is an adverbial qualifier for these stones and they the stones — or their lands — are not far from the evildoers that is from the people of Mecca.
وَإِلَىٰ مَدْيَنَ أَخَاهُمْ شُعَيْباً قَالَ يٰقَوْمِ ٱعْبُدُواْ ٱللَّهَ مَا لَكُمْ مِّنْ إِلَـٰهٍ غَيْرُهُ وَلاَ تَنقُصُواْ ٱلْمِكْيَالَ وَٱلْمِيزَانَ إِنِّيۤ أَرَاكُمْ بِخَيْرٍ وَإِنِّيۤ أَخَافُ عَلَيْكُمْ عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ مُّحِيطٍ,And We sent to Midian their brother Shu‘ayb. He said ‘O my people worship God! affirm His Oneness. You have no god other than He. And diminish not the measure or the weight. I see you in prosperity enjoying a grace which precludes any need for stinting people; and I fear for you should you not believe the chastisement of a besetting day besetting you destroying you the attribution of this term ‘besetting’ to ‘a day’ as opposed to ‘the chastisement’ is figurative for it the chastisement will take place thereupon.
وَيٰقَوْمِ أَوْفُواْ ٱلْمِكْيَالَ وَٱلْمِيزَانَ بِٱلْقِسْطِ وَلاَ تَبْخَسُواْ ٱلنَّاسَ أَشْيَآءَهُمْ وَلاَ تَعْثَوْاْ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ مُفْسِدِينَ,O my people give full measure and weight fulfil the due of both of these in justice and do not defraud people in respect of their goods do not diminish anything of their due and do not be degenerate in the land working corruption by killing or otherwise lā ta‘thaū derives from ‘athiya meaning afsada ‘he corrupted’; mufsidīn ‘working corruption’ is a circumstantial qualifier reiterating the import of the term operating it ta‘thaū ‘do not be degenerate’.
بَقِيَّتُ ٱللَّهِ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ إِن كُنتُم مُّؤْمِنِينَ وَمَآ أَنَاْ عَلَيْكُمْ بِحَفِيظٍ,The remainder which is from God that provision of His which remains for you after you have given full measure and weight is better for you than fraud if you are believers; and I am not a guardian over you’ a watcher that I should requite you for your deeds I was sent only as a warner.
قَالُواْ يٰشُعَيْبُ أَصَلَٰوتُكَ تَأْمُرُكَ أَن نَّتْرُكَ مَا يَعْبُدُ ءابَاؤُنَآ أَوْ أَن نَّفْعَلَ فِيۤ أَمْوَالِنَا مَا نَشَاءُ إِنَّكَ لأَنتَ ٱلْحَلِيمُ ٱلرَّشِيدُ,They said to him mockingly ‘O Shu‘ayb does your way of prayer command you with the obligation to make sure that we should leave what our fathers used to worship of idols or that we should cease to do as we will with our goods? meaning that such a command is an absurdity which no person calling to good would commend. You are indeed the forbearing the right-guided’ they said this in mockery.
قَالَ يٰقَوْمِ أَرَأَيْتُمْ إِن كُنتُ عَلَىٰ بَيِّنَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّي وَرَزَقَنِي مِنْهُ رِزْقاً حَسَناً وَمَآ أُرِيدُ أَنْ أُخَالِفَكُمْ إِلَىٰ مَآ أَنْهَاكُمْ عَنْهُ إِنْ أُرِيدُ إِلاَّ ٱلإِصْلاَحَ مَا ٱسْتَطَعْتُ وَمَا تَوْفِيقِيۤ إِلاَّ بِٱللَّهِ عَلَيْهِ تَوَكَّلْتُ وَإِلَيْهِ أُنِيبُ,He said ‘O my people have you considered that I might be acting upon a clear proof from my Lord and that He has provided me with fair wholesome sustenance from Him? should I then blemish it with what is unlawful in the way of fraud or stinting? And I do not desire to be inconsistent and then partake in what I forbid you thus committing the same. I desire only to set things right in your case by way of enjoining justice so far as I am able. My success my ability to do this successfully and to enjoin other acts of obedience is only with God. In Him I trust and to Him I turn I return repentant.
وَيٰقَوْمِ لاَ يَجْرِمَنَّكُمْ شِقَاقِيۤ أَن يُصِيبَكُم مِّثْلُ مَآ أَصَابَ قَوْمَ نُوحٍ أَوْ قَوْمَ هُودٍ أَوْ قَوْمَ صَالِحٍ وَمَا قَوْمُ لُوطٍ مِّنكُم بِبَعِيدٍ,And O my people let not the breach with me the dispute you have with me shiqāqī ‘the breach with me’ is the subject of the verb yajrimannakum ‘make you deserve’ in which the suffixed pronoun -kum ‘you’ constitutes the first direct object the second being what follows make you deserve earn you as punishment that there befall you the like of what befell the people of Noah or the people of Hūd or the people of Sālih in the way of chastisement; and the people of Lot that is their dwelling-places or the era in which they were destroyed are not far away from you so take heed of this.
وَٱسْتَغْفِرُواْ رَبَّكُمْ ثُمَّ تُوبُوۤاْ إِلَيْهِ إِنَّ رَبِّي رَحِيمٌ وَدُودٌ,And ask forgiveness of your Lord then repent to Him. Truly my Lord is Merciful to believers Affectionate’ loving towards them.
قَالُواْ يٰشُعَيْبُ مَا نَفْقَهُ كَثِيراً مِّمَّا تَقُولُ وَإِنَّا لَنَرَاكَ فِينَا ضَعِيفاً وَلَوْلاَ رَهْطُكَ لَرَجَمْنَاكَ وَمَآ أَنتَ عَلَيْنَا بِعَزِيزٍ,They said in proclamation of their lack of concern ‘O Shu‘ayb we do not understand much of what you say. Truly we see you are weak abject among us and were it not for your clan we would have stoned you; for you are not too powerful too venerable for us’ to stone but it is your clan that is powerful.
قَالَ يٰقَوْمِ أَرَهْطِيۤ أَعَزُّ عَلَيْكُم مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَٱتَّخَذْتُمُوهُ وَرَآءَكُمْ ظِهْرِيّاً إِنَّ رَبِّي بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ مُحِيطٌ,He said ‘O my people is my clan more venerable in your sight than God? such that you refrain from killing me because of them instead of your protecting me for being the Messenger of God? And do you put Him God behind you neglected? rejected behind your backs not mindful of Him? Truly my Lord encompasses in knowledge what you do and will requite you.
وَيٰقَوْمِ ٱعْمَلُواْ عَلَىٰ مَكَانَتِكُمْ إِنِّي عَٰمِلٌ سَوْفَ تَعْلَمُونَ مَن يَأْتِيهِ عَذَابٌ يُخْزِيهِ وَمَنْ هُوَ كَٰذِبٌ وَٱرْتَقِبُوۤاْ إِنِّي مَعَكُمْ رَقِيبٌ,And O my people act according to your ability your circumstances lo! I too am acting according to mine. You will soon know upon whom man is the relative particle introducing the direct object of the action of ‘knowing’ will come the chastisement that will abase him and who is a liar. And sit in watch wait for the consequence of your affair I too will be with you watching’ waiting.
وَلَمَّا جَآءَ أَمْرُنَا نَجَّيْنَا شُعَيْباً وَٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ مَعَهُ بِرَحْمَةٍ مِّنَّا وَأَخَذَتِ ٱلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ الصَّيْحَةُ فَأَصْبَحُواْ فِي دِيَارِهِمْ جَاثِمِينَ,And when Our command came for their destruction We delivered Shu‘ayb and those who believed with him by a mercy from Us; and the Cry seized those who were evildoers — Gabriel cried at them — and they ended up lying lifeless prostrate in their habitations keeled over on their knees dead
كَأَن لَّمْ يَغْنَوْاْ فِيهَآ أَلاَ بُعْداً لِّمَدْيَنَ كَمَا بَعِدَتْ ثَمُودُ,as if ka-an is softened in other words understand it as ka-annahum they had never dwelt there ‘Lo! Away with Midian just as Thamūd was done away with!’
وَلَقَدْ أَرْسَلْنَا مُوسَىٰ بِآيَاتِنَا وَسُلْطَانٍ مُّبِينٍ,And verily We sent Moses with Our signs and a clear warrant a manifest and evident proof
إِلَىٰ فِرْعَوْنَ وَمَلَئِهِ فَٱتَّبَعُوۤاْ أَمْرَ فِرْعَوْنَ وَمَآ أَمْرُ فِرْعَوْنَ بِرَشِيدٍ,to Pharaoh and his council; but they followed Pharaoh’s command and Pharaoh’s command was not right-guided appropriate.
يَقْدُمُ قَوْمَهُ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ فَأَوْرَدَهُمُ ٱلنَّارَ وَبِئْسَ ٱلْوِرْدُ ٱلْمَوْرُودُ,He will go before his people on the Day of Resurrection and they will follow him as they did in this world and he will lead them he will admit them to the Fire — an evil place it is for those entering it!
وَأُتْبِعُواْ فِي هَـٰذِهِ لَعْنَةً وَيَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ بِئْسَ ٱلرِّفْدُ ٱلْمَرْفُودُ,And a curse was made to follow them in this world as well as a curse on the Day of Resurrection — evil is the assistance offered! in their case.
ذَلِكَ مِنْ أَنْبَآءِ ٱلْقُرَىٰ نَقُصُّهُ عَلَيْكَ مِنْهَا قَآئِمٌ وَحَصِيدٌ,That which is mentioned dhālika is the subject the predicate of which follows is something of the tidings of the towns which We relate to you O Muhammad (s). Some of them that is of the towns are standing only its inhabitants having been destroyed and some of them have been cut down destroyed together with its inhabitants such that there are no vestiges thereof much like crops harvested with sickles.
وَمَا ظَلَمْنَاهُمْ وَلَـٰكِن ظَلَمُوۤاْ أَنفُسَهُمْ فَمَا أَغْنَتْ عَنْهُمْ آلِهَتُهُمُ ٱلَّتِي يَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ مِن شَيْءٍ لَّمَّا جَآءَ أَمْرُ رَبِّكَ وَمَا زَادُوهُمْ غَيْرَ تَتْبِيبٍ,And We did not wrong them destroying them for not having committed any sins but they wronged themselves through idolatry. Their gods did not avail defend them in any way min shay’in min is extra those gods upon whom they called whom they worshipped besides God that is other than Him when the command of your Lord His chastisement came; and they their gods — through their the disbelievers’ worship of these gods did not increase them in anything but ruin but loss.
وَكَذٰلِكَ أَخْذُ رَبِّكَ إِذَا أَخَذَ ٱلْقُرَىٰ وَهِيَ ظَالِمَةٌ إِنَّ أَخْذَهُ أَلِيمٌ شَدِيدٌ,Such like that seizing is the seizing of your Lord when He seizes the towns meaning its inhabitants while they are doing wrong by way of sins in other words nothing can avail them in any way when He seizes them. Truly His seizing is painful severe. The two Shaykhs Bukhārī and Muslim reported by way of an isnād from Abū Mūsā al-Ash‘arī that he said ‘The Prophet s said “God gives extended respite to the evildoer but when He seizes him there is no escape for him” whereupon the Prophet s recited the verse Such is the seizing of your Lord Q. 11102 above’.
إِنَّ فِي ذٰلِكَ لآيَةً لِّمَنْ خَافَ عَذَابَ ٱلآخِرَةِ ذٰلِكَ يَوْمٌ مَّجْمُوعٌ لَّهُ ٱلنَّاسُ وَذَٰلِكَ يَوْمٌ مَّشْهُودٌ,There is indeed in that which is mentioned of stories a sign a lesson for him who fears the chastisement of the Hereafter that in other words the Day of Resurrection is a day to which on which mankind will be gathered and that is a day witnessed witnessed by all creatures.
وَمَا نُؤَخِّرُهُ إِلاَّ لأَجَلٍ مَّعْدُودٍ,And We do not defer it but to a term already reckoned but to a time predetermined by God.
يَوْمَ يَأْتِ لاَ تَكَلَّمُ نَفْسٌ إِلاَّ بِإِذْنِهِ فَمِنْهُمْ شَقِيٌّ وَسَعِيدٌ,The day it that day comes no soul shall speak takallamu one of the tā’ letters of tatakallamu has been omitted except by His permission exalted be He. Some of them that is some creatures will be wretched and some of them joyous each having been determined to be thus from pre-eternity.
فَأَمَّا ٱلَّذِينَ شَقُواْ فَفِي ٱلنَّارِ لَهُمْ فِيهَا زَفِيرٌ وَشَهِيقٌ,As for those who are damned according to God’s prior knowledge they will be in the Fire; their lot therein will be wailing which is a loud sound and sighing which is a faint sound;
خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا مَا دَامَتِ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتُ وَٱلأَرْضُ إِلاَّ مَا شَآءَ رَبُّكَ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ فَعَّالٌ لِّمَا يُرِيدُ,abiding therein for as long as the heavens and the earth endure that is for the length of the duration of both in this world except other than what your Lord may will in the way of adding to the duration of these two such that it their abiding becomes indefinite meaning that they will abide therein forever. Truly your Lord is Doer of what He desires.
وَأَمَّا ٱلَّذِينَ سُعِدُواْ فَفِي ٱلْجَنَّةِ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا مَا دَامَتِ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتُ وَٱلأَرْضُ إِلاَّ مَا شَآءَ رَبُّكَ عَطَآءً غَيْرَ مَجْذُوذٍ,And as for those who are fortunate read sa‘idū or su‘idū they shall be in Paradise abiding therein for as long as the heavens and the earth endure except other than what your Lord may will — as mentioned already of increasing the duration which in their case is indicated by His words an endless bounty one not to be cut off. The interpretation given above seems to be the clear and obvious one devoid of affectation but God knows best what it means.
فَلاَ تَكُ فِي مِرْيَةٍ مِّمَّا يَعْبُدُ هَـٰؤُلاۤءِ مَا يَعْبُدُونَ إِلاَّ كَمَا يَعْبُدُ آبَاؤُهُم مِّن قَبْلُ وَإِنَّا لَمُوَفُّوهُمْ نَصِيبَهُمْ غَيْرَ مَنقُوصٍ,So do not be O Muhammad (s) in doubt in uncertainty concerning what these folk worship of idols We will indeed chastise them as We did those before them — this is intended as solace for the Prophet s. They worship only as their fathers worshipped — that is in the same way — before and indeed We chastised them; and We shall surely pay them like those fathers of theirs their whole due their portion of the chastisement undiminished that is in full.
وَلَقَدْ آتَيْنَا مُوسَىٰ ٱلْكِتَابَ فَٱخْتُلِفَ فِيهِ وَلَوْلاَ كَلِمَةٌ سَبَقَتْ مِن رَّبِّكَ لَقُضِيَ بَيْنَهُمْ وَإِنَّهُمْ لَفِي شَكٍّ مِّنْهُ مُرِيبٍ,And We verily gave Moses the Scripture the Torah but differences arose concerning it some believing others denying just as is the case with the Qur’ān; and were it not for a word that went forth from your Lord to defer the reckoning and the requital for creatures to the Day of Resurrection the case would have been decided between them in this world regarding that over which they differed; and truly they that is those who deny it are in grave doubt concerning it doubt creating great uncertainty.
وَإِنَّ كُـلاًّ لَّمَّا لَيُوَفِّيَنَّهُمْ رَبُّكَ أَعْمَالَهُمْ إِنَّهُ بِمَا يَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيرٌ,And assuredly read wa-in or wa-inna to each that is to all creatures verily la-mā the mā is extra and the lām is in the place of an implied oath or a separator; a variant reading has lammā with the sense of illā ‘but’ making the preceding in for negation your Lord will pay for his works that is the requital thereof in full. Truly He is Aware of what they do knowing the inner and outer aspects thereof.
فَٱسْتَقِمْ كَمَآ أُمِرْتَ وَمَن تَابَ مَعَكَ وَلاَ تَطْغَوْاْ إِنَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ,So remain upright acting in accordance with the commandment of your Lord and supplicating Him as you have been commanded and let him also remain upright he who repents who believes with you; and do not transgress do not overstep the bounds of God. Truly He sees what you do and will requite you for it.
وَلاَ تَرْكَنُوۤاْ إِلَى ٱلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ فَتَمَسَّكُمُ ٱلنَّارُ وَمَا لَكُمْ مِّن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ مِنْ أَوْلِيَآءَ ثُمَّ لاَ تُنصَرُونَ,And do not incline toward the evildoers through affection or adulation or by showing satisfaction with their actions lest the Fire touch smite you and you have besides God other than Him no protectors min awliyā’ min is extra to guard you from Him; and then you will not be helped you will not be protected from His chastisement.
وَأَقِمِ ٱلصَّلاَةَ طَرَفَيِ ٱلنَّهَارِ وَزُلَفاً مِّنَ ٱلَّيْلِ إِنَّ ٱلْحَسَنَاتِ يُذْهِبْنَ ٱلسَّـيِّئَاتِ ذٰلِكَ ذِكْرَىٰ لِلذَّاكِرِينَ,And establish prayer at the two ends of the day at first light and before sunset that is pray in the morning at noon and in the afternoon and in some watches zulafan is the plural of zulfa a portion of the night that is at sunset and late evening. Indeed good deeds such as the five prayers annul misdeeds minor sins this was revealed regarding one who kissed a female stranger and told the Prophet s about it and then asked him ‘Is this verse true for me?’ and the Prophet said to him ‘It is so for every person of my community’ as reported by the two Shaykhs Bukhārī and Muslim. That is a remembrance for the mindful an admonition for those who heed them.
وَٱصْبِرْ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لاَ يُضِيعُ أَجْرَ ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,And be patient O Muhammad (s) in enduring the harm inflicted upon you by your people or in performing prayer for indeed God does not waste the wage of those who are virtuous by patiently enduring through acts of obedience to God.
فَلَوْلاَ كَانَ مِنَ ٱلْقُرُونِ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ أُوْلُواْ بَقِيَّةٍ يَنْهَوْنَ عَنِ ٱلْفَسَادِ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً مِّمَّنْ أَنجَيْنَا مِنْهُمْ وَٱتَّبَعَ ٱلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ مَآ أُتْرِفُواْ فِيهِ وَكَانُواْ مُجْرِمِينَ,If only there had been among the generations past communities before you men possessing a remnant of good sense men of religion and virtue forbidding corruption in the earth this statement is intended to be a negation in other words ‘there never were such men among them’ except but a few of those whom mimman min is explicative We delivered from among them did forbid corruption and were thus delivered. But those who did wrong through corruption and neglecting to forbid followed that by which they were made profligate and were sinners.
وَمَا كَانَ رَبُّكَ لِيُهْلِكَ ٱلْقُرَىٰ بِظُلْمٍ وَأَهْلُهَا مُصْلِحُونَ,Yet your Lord would never destroy the towns through injustice on His part against them while their inhabitants were righteous that is believers.
وَلَوْ شَآءَ رَبُّكَ لَجَعَلَ ٱلنَّاسَ أُمَّةً وَاحِدَةً وَلاَ يَزَالُونَ مُخْتَلِفِينَ,Had your Lord willed He would have made mankind one community people of one religion but they continue to differ in religion
إِلاَّ مَن رَّحِمَ رَبُّكَ وَلِذٰلِكَ خَلَقَهُمْ وَتَمَّتْ كَلِمَةُ رَبِّكَ لأَمْلأَنَّ جَهَنَّمَ مِنَ ٱلْجِنَّةِ وَٱلنَّاسِ أَجْمَعِينَ,except those on whom your Lord has mercy those for whom He desires good and so they do not differ in it — and that is why He created them that is He created those of difference for that in other words so that they should differ and those deserving mercy for that in other words so that they should receive mercy. And the Word of your Lord has been fulfilled namely ‘I will surely fill Hell with jinn and mankind together’.
وَكُـلاًّ نَّقُصُّ عَلَيْكَ مِنْ أَنْبَاءِ ٱلرُّسُلِ مَا نُثَبِّتُ بِهِ فُؤَادَكَ وَجَآءَكَ فِي هَـٰذِهِ ٱلْحَقُّ وَمَوْعِظَةٌ وَذِكْرَىٰ لِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,And all that kullān is in the accusative because it is the direct object of naqussu ‘We relate’; and the nunation compensates for a missing genitive annexation that is all that is necessary We relate to you of the accounts of the messengers that mā substitutes for kullan ‘all that’ with which We might strengthen reassure your heart. And in these accounts or verses there has come to you the Truth and an admonition and a reminder to the believers they are specifically mentioned here because they are the ones to benefit from them through their belief in them in contrast to the case with the disbelievers.
وَقُل لِّلَّذِينَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ ٱعْمَلُواْ عَلَىٰ مَكَانَتِكُمْ إِنَّا عَامِلُونَ,And say to those who do not believe ‘Act according to your ability according to your status we are acting according to our status — this is a threat for them.
وَٱنْتَظِرُوۤاْ إِنَّا مُنتَظِرُونَ,And wait for the consequence of your affair we are also waiting’ for this.
وَلِلَّهِ غَيْبُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَإِلَيْهِ يُرْجَعُ ٱلأَمْرُ كُلُّهُ فَٱعْبُدْهُ وَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَيْهِ وَمَا رَبُّكَ بِغَافِلٍ عَمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ,And to God belongs the Unseen of the heavens and the earth that is the knowledge of what is concealed within them and to Him all matters are returned read active yarji‘u meaning ‘return’ or passive yurja‘u meaning ‘are returned’ and He will exact retribution from those who were disobedient. So worship Him affirm His Oneness and rely on Him trust in Him for He is sufficient for you and your Lord is not heedless of what they do but He defers dealing with them until their appointed time a variant reading has ta‘malūn ‘what you do’.
الۤر تِلْكَ آيَاتُ ٱلْكِتَابِ ٱلْمُبِينِ,Alif lām rā’ God knows best what He means by these letters. Those verses are the verses of the Book the Qur’ān the genitive annexation carries the meaning of partitive min ‘from’ that makes plain the one that manifests truth distinguishing it from what is falsehood.
إِنَّآ أَنْزَلْنَاهُ قُرْآناً عَرَبِيّاً لَّعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ,We have revealed it as an Arabic Qur’ān in the language of the Arabs so that you O people of Mecca might understand comprehend its meaning.
نَحْنُ نَقُصُّ عَلَيْكَ أَحْسَنَ ٱلْقَصَصِ بِمَآ أَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَيْكَ هَـٰذَا ٱلْقُرْآنَ وَإِن كُنتَ مِن قَبْلِهِ لَمِنَ ٱلْغَافِلِينَ,We will relate to you the best of narratives in what We have revealed in Our revealing to you this Qur’ān though wa-in in is softened in other words understand it as wa-innahu prior to it you were of the heedless.
إِذْ قَالَ يُوسُفُ لأَبِيهِ يٰأَبتِ إِنِّي رَأَيْتُ أَحَدَ عَشَرَ كَوْكَباً وَٱلشَّمْسَ وَٱلْقَمَرَ رَأَيْتُهُمْ لِي سَاجِدِينَ,Mention when Joseph said to his father Jacob ‘O my father read yā abati to indicate the omitted yā’ of genitive annexation sc. of yā abī; or read yā abata to indicate that an alif originally a yā’ has been omitted I saw in my sleep eleven planets and the sun and the moon I saw them repeated for emphasis prostrating themselves before me’ sājidīn this plural form is used to describe the act of ‘prostration’ which is an attribute associated with rational beings.
قَالَ يٰبُنَيَّ لاَ تَقْصُصْ رُؤْيَاكَ عَلَىٰ إِخْوَتِكَ فَيَكِيدُواْ لَكَ كَيْداً إِنَّ ٱلشَّيْطَانَ لِلإِنْسَانِ عَدُوٌّ مُّبِينٌ,He said ‘O my son do not relate your vision to your brothers lest they plot against you some plot lest they scheme to kill you out of envy knowing that the interpretation of the dream is that they represent the eleven planets your mother the sun and your father the moon. Truly Satan is to man a manifest foe one of evident enmity.
وَكَذٰلِكَ يَجْتَبِيكَ رَبُّكَ وَيُعَلِّمُكَ مِن تَأْوِيلِ ٱلأَحَادِيثِ وَيُتِمُّ نِعْمَتَهُ عَلَيْكَ وَعَلَىٰ ءَالِ يَعْقُوبَ كَمَآ أَتَمَّهَآ عَلَىٰ أَبَوَيْكَ مِن قَبْلُ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَإِسْحَاقَ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ عَلِيمٌ حَكِيمٌ,Thus in the way that you have seen will your Lord prefer you choose you and teach you the interpretation of events the interpretation of visions and perfect His grace upon you with prophethood and upon the House of Jacob — upon his sons — as He perfected it with prophethood formerly on your fathers Abraham and Isaac. Truly your Lord is Knower of His creatures Wise’ in what He does with them.
لَّقَدْ كَانَ فِي يُوسُفَ وَإِخْوَتِهِ آيَاتٌ لِّلسَّائِلِينَ,Verily in the tale of Joseph and his brethren — who were eleven — are signs lessons for those who inquire about their tale.
إِذْ قَالُواْ لَيُوسُفُ وَأَخُوهُ أَحَبُّ إِلَىٰ أَبِينَا مِنَّا وَنَحْنُ عُصْبَةٌ إِنَّ أَبَانَا لَفِي ضَلاَلٍ مُّبِينٍ,Mention when they that is when some of Joseph’s brothers said to some of the others ‘Surely Joseph la-Yūsufu is the subject and his brother his full brother Benjamin are dearer ahabbu is the predicate to our father than we are though we be a hardy band a group. Lo! our father is in plain aberration in manifest error for preferring those two to us.
ٱقْتُلُواْ يُوسُفَ أَوِ ٱطْرَحُوهُ أَرْضاً يَخْلُ لَكُمْ وَجْهُ أَبِيكُمْ وَتَكُونُواْ مِن بَعْدِهِ قَوْماً صَالِحِينَ,Kill Joseph or cast him away into some land that is into some distant land so that your father might be solely concerned with you so that he might turn his attention to you and not be distracted by anyone else and that thereafter that is after killing Joseph or casting him away you might be a righteous folk’ by repenting.
قَالَ قَآئِلٌ مِّنْهُمْ لاَ تَقْتُلُواْ يُوسُفَ وَأَلْقُوهُ فِي غَيَٰبَتِ ٱلْجُبِّ يَلْتَقِطْهُ بَعْضُ ٱلسَّيَّارَةِ إِن كُنتُمْ فَاعِلِينَ,One of them namely Judah said ‘Do not kill Joseph but cast him throw him into the bottom of a well ghayābat al-jubb is the darkest recess of a well; a variant reading has the plural ghayābāt so that some caravan might pick him up if you are to do anything’ of what you desire in the way of separating Joseph from us so content yourselves with this solution.
قَالُواْ يَٰأَبَانَا مَا لَكَ لاَ تَأْمَنَّا عَلَىٰ يُوسُفَ وَإِنَّا لَهُ لَنَاصِحُونَ,They said ‘O father what is wrong with you that you do not trust us with Joseph? We are indeed his well-wishers we are indeed only looking out for his best interests.
أَرْسِلْهُ مَعَنَا غَداً يَرْتَعْ وَيَلْعَبْ وَإِنَّا لَهُ لَحَافِظُونَ,Send him forth with us tomorrow to the desert to frolic and play read first person plural narta‘ wa-nal‘ab ‘that we might frolic and play’ or third person plural yarta‘ wa-yal‘ab ‘that he might frolic and play’ in other words so that we might be spirited and roam freely. Surely we shall take good care of him’.
قَالَ إِنِّي لَيَحْزُنُنِيۤ أَن تَذْهَبُواْ بِهِ وَأَخَافُ أَن يَأْكُلَهُ ٱلذِّئْبُ وَأَنْتُمْ عَنْهُ غَافِلُونَ,He said ‘Lo! It grieves me that you should go with him that is your departure with him grieves me because I would be separated from him and I fear lest the wolf devour him al-dhi’b here represents the genus for their land had many wolves in it while you are heedless of him’ distracted by something else.
قَالُواْ لَئِنْ أَكَلَهُ ٱلذِّئْبُ وَنَحْنُ عُصْبَةٌ إِنَّآ إِذَاً لَّخَاسِرُونَ,They said ‘Truly if la-in the lām here is for oaths the wolf were to devour him when we are so hardy a band a group then we indeed are losers!’ incapable of anything. Thus he sent him off with them.
فَلَمَّا ذَهَبُواْ بِهِ وَأَجْمَعُوۤاْ أَن يَجْعَلُوهُ فِي غَيَٰبَتِ ٱلْجُبِّ وَأَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَيْهِ لَتُنَبِّئَنَّهُمْ بِأَمْرِهِمْ هَـٰذَا وَهُمْ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ,So when they went off with him and agreed resolved to put him into the bottom of the well the response of lammā ‘when’ has been omitted in other words understand it as being fa‘alū dhālika ‘they did just that’ by taking off his shirt — after having beaten him humiliated him and desiring to kill him — and lowering him in a bucket into the well. When he reached half-way down the well they flung him from the bucket so that he would fall and die but he fell into the water and took refuge near a rock. They then called to him and he responded thinking that they had decided to have mercy on him. They then wanted to smash his head with a rock but Judah prevented them. And We revealed to him in the well through true revelation wahy haqīqa — he was 17 years of age or just under — in order to reassure his heart ‘Truly you shall inform them after this day of this affair this deed of theirs when they are unaware’ of who you are wa-hum lā yash‘urūna is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the action of ‘informing’.
وَجَآءُوۤا أَبَاهُمْ عِشَآءً يَبْكُونَ,And they came to their father in the evening weeping.
قَالُواْ يَٰأَبَانَآ إِنَّا ذَهَبْنَا نَسْتَبِقُ وَتَرَكْنَا يُوسُفَ عِندَ مَتَاعِنَا فَأَكَلَهُ ٱلذِّئْبُ وَمَآ أَنتَ بِمُؤْمِنٍ لَّنَا وَلَوْ كُنَّا صَادِقِينَ,They said ‘O father we went competing shooting and left Joseph by our things our clothes and the wolf ate him. But you would never believe us even though we speak the truth’ before you you would still have accused us of lying in this story because of your adoration of Joseph so how much more so when you think ill of us?
وَجَآءُوا عَلَىٰ قَمِيصِهِ بِدَمٍ كَذِبٍ قَالَ بَلْ سَوَّلَتْ لَكُمْ أَنفُسُكُمْ أَمْراً فَصَبْرٌ جَمِيلٌ وَٱللَّهُ ٱلْمُسْتَعَانُ عَلَىٰ مَا تَصِفُونَ,And they came with false blood on his shirt ‘alā qamīsihi has the status of an accusative of the verb because it is an adverbial qualifier meaning fawqa qamīsihi they slaughtered a lamb and dabbed it his shirt with its blood — but they forgot to tear it the shirt — and they said that it was his blood. He Jacob said when he saw that it the shirt was undamaged and realised that they were lying ‘Nay but your souls have beguiled you into something and so you did it to him. Yet comely patience! without any anxiety! fa-sabrun jamīlun is the predicate of a missing subject such as amrī ‘my course’. And God is the One Whose succour is sought in that predicament which you describe’ that which you mention of Joseph’s affair.
وَجَاءَتْ سَيَّارَةٌ فَأَرْسَلُواْ وَارِدَهُمْ فَأَدْلَىٰ دَلْوَهُ قَالَ يٰبُشْرَىٰ هَـٰذَا غُلاَمٌ وَأَسَرُّوهُ بِضَاعَةً وَٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ بِمَا يَعْمَلُونَ,And there came a caravan — travellers going from Midian to Egypt who stopped near to Joseph’s well — and they sent their water-drawer the one who goes down to the water source to draw from it and he let down his bucket into the well and Joseph clung to it and he pulled him out and when he saw him he said ‘Good news!’ a variant reading of yā bushrā has yā bushrāya this vocative call is figurative in other words it is to be understood as ‘Come O good news now is your time!’ ‘This is a young boy’. His brothers became aware of this and came to him and they hid him that is they disguised his real status claiming that he was as a piece of merchandise by saying ‘This is a slave of ours he is a runaway’; but Joseph did not say anything fearing that they might kill him. But God knew well what they were doing.
وَشَرَوْهُ بِثَمَنٍ بَخْسٍ دَرَاهِمَ مَعْدُودَةٍ وَكَانُواْ فِيهِ مِنَ ٱلزَّاهِدِينَ,Then they sold him — they the caravan purchased him from them — for a very low a diminished price a handful of dirhams 20 or 22; for they that is his brothers set small store by him. So the caravan brought him to Egypt where the one who had bought him sold him for 20 dinars two pairs of sandals and two robes.
وَقَالَ ٱلَّذِي ٱشْتَرَاهُ مِن مِّصْرَ لاِمْرَأَتِهِ أَكْرِمِي مَثْوَاهُ عَسَىٰ أَن يَنفَعَنَآ أَوْ نَتَّخِذَهُ وَلَداً وَكَذٰلِكَ مَكَّنَّا لِيُوسُفَ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَلِنُعَلِّمَهُ مِن تَأْوِيلِ ٱلأَحَادِيثِ وَٱللَّهُ غَالِبٌ عَلَىٰ أَمْرِهِ وَلَـٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ ٱلنَّاسِ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ,And he of Egypt who purchased him Potifar the Court Officer Qitfīr al-‘azīz said to his wife Zulaikha Zulaykhā ‘Give him an honourable place an honourable residence with us. Maybe he will be useful to us or we may adopt him as a son’ — for he was chaste. Thus just as We delivered him from being killed and from the well and softened the Court Officer’s heart for him We established Joseph in the land the land of Egypt until he attained what status he attained that We might teach him the interpretation of events the interpretation of visions wa-li-nu‘allimahu min ta’wīli’l-ahādīth is a supplement to an implied missing part connected to makkannā ‘We established’ in other words an implied li-numallikahu ‘so that We might give him kingship’; or else the wāw of wa-li-nu‘allimahu ‘that We might teach him’ is to be understood as being extra. God’s way always prevails exalted be He nothing being beyond Him but most people — and they are the disbelievers — do not know this.
وَلَمَّا بَلَغَ أَشُدَّهُ آتَيْنَاهُ حُكْماً وَعِلْماً وَكَذٰلِكَ نَجْزِي ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,And when he reached his prime — which was at 30 or 33 years of age — We gave him power of judgement wisdom and knowledge understanding in matters of religion before his call to prophethood. Thus just as We rewarded him We reward those who are virtuous to the good of their souls.
وَرَاوَدَتْهُ ٱلَّتِي هُوَ فِي بَيْتِهَا عَن نَّفْسِهِ وَغَلَّقَتِ ٱلأَبْوَابَ وَقَالَتْ هَيْتَ لَكَ قَالَ مَعَاذَ ٱللَّهِ إِنَّهُ رَبِّيۤ أَحْسَنَ مَثْوَايَ إِنَّهُ لاَ يُفْلِحُ ٱلظَّالِمُونَ,And she in whose house he was — namely Zulaykhā — attempted to seduce him that is she asked him to lie with her and she closed the doors of the house. And she said to him ‘Come!’ hayta laka the lām of laka is for clarification; a variant reading has hīta laka or haytu laka. ‘God forbid!’ I seek refuge with God from this he said. ‘Truly he who bought me is my lord my master who has given me an honourable place an honourable residence and so I cannot betray him with regard to his family. Truly evildoers fornicators never prosper’.
وَلَقَدْ هَمَّتْ بِهِ وَهَمَّ بِهَا لَوْلاۤ أَن رَّأَى بُرْهَانَ رَبِّهِ كَذَلِكَ لِنَصْرِفَ عَنْهُ ٱلسُّوۤءَ وَٱلْفَحْشَآءَ إِنَّهُ مِنْ عِبَادِنَا ٱلْمُخْلَصِينَ,And she certainly desired him she sought sexual intercourse with him and he would have desired her too he would have sought the same had it not been that he saw the proof of his Lord Ibn ‘Abbās said ‘Jacob was made to appear before him and he struck his Joseph’s breast whereupon his sexual desire withdrew from his body through his fingernails the response to lawlā ‘had it not been’ has been omitted understood to be la-jāma‘ahā ‘he would have lain with her’. So it was that We made him see the proof that We might ward off from him evil betrayal and lewdness the act of fornication. Truly he was of Our devoted servants in terms of obedience mukhlisīn a variant reading has mukhlasīn in other words ‘chosen/purified servants’.
وَٱسْتَبَقَا ٱلْبَابَ وَقَدَّتْ قَمِيصَهُ مِن دُبُرٍ وَأَلْفَيَا سَيِّدَهَا لَدَى ٱلْبَابِ قَالَتْ مَا جَزَآءُ مَنْ أَرَادَ بِأَهْلِكَ سُوۤءًا إِلاَّ أَن يُسْجَنَ أَوْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,And they raced to the door Joseph making for it in order to escape while she in order to grab hold of him caught hold of his garment and pulled him towards her and she tore his shirt from behind whereupon they encountered her master her husband at the door. She composed herself and then said ‘What is to be the requital of him who intends evil who intends fornication against your folk but that he should be imprisoned locked up in a jail or suffer a painful chastisement?’ by having him beaten.
قَالَ هِيَ رَاوَدَتْنِي عَن نَّفْسِي وَشَهِدَ شَاهِدٌ مِّنْ أَهْلِهَآ إِن كَانَ قَمِيصُهُ قُدَّ مِن قُبُلٍ فَصَدَقَتْ وَهُوَ مِنَ الكَاذِبِينَ,He Joseph said declaring himself innocent of the charge ‘It was she who attempted to seduce me’. And a witness of her own folk testified her paternal cousin — it is reported that he was still a child in the cradle — and he said ‘If his shirt has been torn from the front then she speaks the truth and he is of the liars;
وَإِنْ كَانَ قَمِيصُهُ قُدَّ مِن دُبُرٍ فَكَذَبَتْ وَهُوَ مِن الصَّادِقِينَ,but if his shirt has been torn from behind then she has lied and he is of the truthful’.
فَلَمَّا رَأَى قَمِيصَهُ قُدَّ مِن دُبُرٍ قَالَ إِنَّهُ مِن كَيْدِكُنَّ إِنَّ كَيْدَكُنَّ عَظِيمٌ,So when he her husband saw that his shirt was torn from behind he said ‘Indeed this — that is your saying ‘What is to be the requital of him who intends …’ to the end of the verse Q. 1225 — is of the guile of you O women. Verily your guile is great.
يُوسُفُ أَعْرِضْ عَنْ هَـٰذَا وَٱسْتَغْفِرِي لِذَنبِكِ إِنَّكِ كُنتِ مِنَ ٱلْخَاطِئِينَ,Then he said O Joseph ignore this matter and do not mention it to anyone lest it be broadcast; and you O Zulaykhā ask forgiveness for your sin surely you have been of the erring’ the sinful; but the tale was reported and became public.
وَقَالَ نِسْوَةٌ فِي ٱلْمَدِينَةِ ٱمْرَأَةُ ٱلْعَزِيزِ تُرَاوِدُ فَتَاهَا عَن نَّفْسِهِ قَدْ شَغَفَهَا حُبّاً إِنَّا لَنَرَاهَا فِي ضَلاَلٍ مُّبِينٍ,And some of the women in the city the city of Egypt said ‘The Court Officer’s wife has been seducing her boy her servant. Indeed he has smitten her heart with love hubban is for specification in other words ‘her love of him has entered her heart’s pericardium shaghāfa qalbihā that is its inner casing. Lo! we see her to be in plain aberration’ that is in error evident in her love of him.
فَلَمَّا سَمِعَتْ بِمَكْرِهِنَّ أَرْسَلَتْ إِلَيْهِنَّ وَأَعْتَدَتْ لَهُنَّ مُتَّكَئاً وَآتَتْ كُلَّ وَاحِدَةٍ مِّنْهُنَّ سِكِّيناً وَقَالَتِ ٱخْرُجْ عَلَيْهِنَّ فَلَمَّا رَأَيْنَهُ أَكْبَرْنَهُ وَقَطَّعْنَ أَيْدِيَهُنَّ وَقُلْنَ حَاشَ لِلَّهِ مَا هَـٰذَا بَشَراً إِنْ هَـٰذَآ إِلاَّ مَلَكٌ كَرِيمٌ,And when she heard of their machinations their backbiting of her she sent for them and prepared for them a repast muttaka’ is food that requires cutting with a knife since one leans upon it ittikā’ this repast was utruj ‘citron’. She then gave each one of them a knife and said to Joseph ‘Come out before them!’ And when they saw him they were in awe of they exalted him and cut their hands with the knives without feeling any pain because their hearts were so engrossed by Joseph and they exclaimed ‘God preserve us! — in exaltation of him — This namely Joseph is no human being this is but a noble angel!’ on account of his all-encompassing beauty which is a characteristic not usually found among humankind. In the Sahīh of al-Bukhārī it is reported that one half of all beauty was given to him.
قَالَتْ فَذٰلِكُنَّ ٱلَّذِي لُمْتُنَّنِي فِيهِ وَلَقَدْ رَاوَدتُّهُ عَن نَّفْسِهِ فَٱسَتَعْصَمَ وَلَئِن لَّمْ يَفْعَلْ مَآ آمُرُهُ لَيُسْجَنَنَّ وَلَيَكُوناً مِّن ٱلصَّاغِرِينَ,She the wife of the Court Officer said when she saw what happened to them ‘This is he on whose account for the love of whom you blamed me alladhī lumtunnanī fīhi is an explication of her excuse. Indeed I did attempt to seduce him but he withheld himself he refused. Yet if he does not do what I bid him he verily shall be imprisoned and verily shall be of those brought low’ those abased. The women said to him ‘Obey your mistress!’.
قَالَ رَبِّ ٱلسِّجْنُ أَحَبُّ إِلَيَّ مِمَّا يَدْعُونَنِيۤ إِلَيْهِ وَإِلاَّ تَصْرِفْ عَنِّي كَيْدَهُنَّ أَصْبُ إِلَيْهِنَّ وَأَكُن مِّنَ ٱلْجَاهِلِينَ,He said ‘My Lord prison is dearer to me than that to which they are urging me. And if You do not fend off their wiles from me then I shall tend I shall incline towards them and become of the ignorant the sinful this is intended as a supplication which is why God exalted be He then says
فَٱسْتَجَابَ لَهُ رَبُّهُ فَصَرَفَ عَنْهُ كَيْدَهُنَّ إِنَّهُ هُوَ ٱلسَّمِيعُ ٱلْعَلِيمُ,So his Lord answered him his supplication and He fended off their wiles from him. Truly He is the Hearer of words the Knower of deeds.
ثُمَّ بَدَا لَهُمْ مِّن بَعْدِ مَا رَأَوُاْ ٱلآيَاتِ لَيَسْجُنُنَّهُ حَتَّىٰ حِينٍ,Then it seemed it appeared good to them after they had seen the signs indicating Joseph’s innocence that they should imprison him for a while until such time as people ceased to talk of him. He was thus imprisoned.
وَدَخَلَ مَعَهُ ٱلسِّجْنَ فَتَيَانِ قَالَ أَحَدُهُمَآ إِنِّيۤ أَرَانِيۤ أَعْصِرُ خَمْراً وَقَالَ ٱلآخَرُ إِنِّي أَرَانِيۤ أَحْمِلُ فَوْقَ رَأْسِي خُبْزاً تَأْكُلُ ٱلطَّيْرُ مِنْهُ نَبِّئْنَا بِتَأْوِيلِهِ إِنَّا نَرَاكَ مِنَ ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,And there entered the prison with him two youths two young men servants of the king one of whom was his cup-bearer the other his food-taster. They noticed that he interpreted dreams and so they said ‘Let us try him’. One of them the cup-bearer said ‘I dreamed that I was pressing wine’ that is grapes. The other the food-taster said ‘I dreamed that I was carrying on my head bread whereof the birds were eating. Tell us inform us of its interpretation for indeed we see you as being among the virtuous’.
قَالَ لاَ يَأْتِيكُمَا طَعَامٌ تُرْزَقَانِهِ إِلاَّ نَبَّأْتُكُمَا بِتَأْوِيلِهِ قَبْلَ أَن يَأْتِيكُمَا ذٰلِكُمَا مِمَّا عَلَّمَنِي رَبِّيۤ إِنِّي تَرَكْتُ مِلَّةَ قَوْمٍ لاَّ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱللَّهِ وَهُمْ بِٱلآخِرَةِ هُمْ كَافِرُونَ,He said to them both in order to inform them that he knew how to interpret dreams ‘The food with which you are provided shall not come to you while you are asleep but I shall tell you the interpretation thereof while you are conscious before it the interpretation thereof comes to you. This is from that which my Lord has taught me — herein is an incitement for them to believe which he reinforces with the following words Lo! I have forsaken the creed the religion of a folk who do not believe in God and who moreover hum ‘they’ is repeated for emphasis are disbelievers in the Hereafter.
وَٱتَّبَعْتُ مِلَّةَ آبَآئِـيۤ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَإِسْحَاقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ مَا كَانَ لَنَآ أَن نُّشْرِكَ بِٱللَّهِ مِن شَيْءٍ ذٰلِكَ مِن فَضْلِ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْنَا وَعَلَى ٱلنَّاسِ وَلَـٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ ٱلنَّاسِ لاَ يَشْكُرُونَ,And I follow the creed of my fathers Abraham and Isaac and Jacob. It never was right for us to associate anything min shay’in min is extra with God — on account of our God-given immunity from error. That affirmation of God’s Oneness is from God’s bounty to us and to mankind; but most people — and these are the disbelievers — do not give thanks to God and so they associate others with Him.
يٰصَاحِبَيِ ٱلسِّجْنِ ءَأَرْبَابٌ مُّتَّفَرِّقُونَ خَيْرٌ أَمِ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْوَاحِدُ ٱلْقَهَّارُ,He Joseph then explicitly calls them to faith saying O my two fellow-prisoners! inmates of the prison Are several lords better or is God the One the Almighty better? an interrogative meant as an affirmative.
مَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِهِ إِلاَّ أَسْمَآءً سَمَّيْتُمُوهَآ أَنتُمْ وَآبَآؤُكُمْ مَّآ أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ بِهَا مِن سُلْطَانٍ إِنِ ٱلْحُكْمُ إِلاَّ للَّهِ أَمَرَ أَلاَّ تَعْبُدُوۤاْ إِلاَّ إِيَّاهُ ذٰلِكَ ٱلدِّينُ ٱلْقَيِّمُ وَلَـٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ ٱلنَّاسِ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ,You do not worship apart from Him that is other than Him anything but mere names that you have named that you have named for idols you and your fathers. God has not revealed any warrant any definitive argument or proof regarding them regarding worship of them. Judgement decree belongs only to God alone. He has commanded that you worship none but Him. That affirmation of God’s Oneness is the upright the straight religion but most people — and these are the disbelievers — do not know the punishment in which they shall end up and so they ascribe partners to God.
يٰصَاحِبَيِ ٱلسِّجْنِ أَمَّآ أَحَدُكُمَا فَيَسْقِي رَبَّهُ خَمْراً وَأَمَّا ٱلآخَرُ فَيُصْلَبُ فَتَأْكُلُ ٱلطَّيْرُ مِن رَّأْسِهِ قُضِيَ ٱلأَمْرُ ٱلَّذِي فِيهِ تَسْتَفْتِيَانِ,O fellow-prisoners! As for one of you that is the cup-bearer he will depart after three days and he shall serve his lord his master wine to drink as usual; and as for the other he will depart after three days and he will be crucified so that the birds will eat from his head this is the interpretation of both your dreams. They said ‘We never dreamed a thing!’; he said decided concluded is the matter regarding which you sought opinion’ about which you enquired whether you spoke truthfully or were lying.
وَقَالَ لِلَّذِي ظَنَّ أَنَّهُ نَاجٍ مِّنْهُمَا ٱذْكُرْنِي عِندَ رَبِّكَ فَأَنْسَاهُ ٱلشَّيْطَانُ ذِكْرَ رَبِّهِ فَلَبِثَ فِي ٱلسِّجْنِ بِضْعَ سِنِينَ,Then he said to the one whom he deemed whom he was certain would be saved of the two — and this was the cup-bearer ‘Mention me to your lord’ your master and say to him ‘There is a young man in jail who has been wrongly imprisoned’. So he the cup-bearer departed but Satan caused him that is the cup-bearer to forget the mention of Joseph before his master so that he Joseph stayed he remained in prison for some years it is said that he remained for seven years or for twelve.
وَقَالَ ٱلْمَلِكُ إِنِّيۤ أَرَىٰ سَبْعَ بَقَرَاتٍ سِمَانٍ يَأْكُلُهُنَّ سَبْعٌ عِجَافٌ وَسَبْعَ سُنْبُلاَتٍ خُضْرٍ وَأُخَرَ يَابِسَاتٍ يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلْمَلأُ أَفْتُونِي فِي رُؤْيَايَ إِن كُنتُمْ لِلرُّءْيَا تَعْبُرُونَ,And the king the king of Egypt — al-Rayyān b. al-Walīd — said ‘I saw in a dream seven fat kine being devoured being swallowed up by seven lean ones of kine ‘ijāf is the plural of ‘ajfā’ and seven green ears of corn and others that is seven other ears of corn dry that had wound themselves around the green ones and risen above them. O courtiers! Give me your opinion about my vision expound for me its interpretation if you can interpret visions’ then interpret it for me.
قَالُوۤاْ أَضْغَاثُ أَحْلاَمٍ وَمَا نَحْنُ بِتَأْوِيلِ ٱلأَحْلاَمِ بِعَالِمِينَ,They said this is ‘A jumble a mixture of dreams! And we are not knowledgeable in the interpretation of dreams’.
وَقَالَ ٱلَّذِي نَجَا مِنْهُمَا وَٱدَّكَرَ بَعْدَ أُمَّةٍ أَنَاْ أُنَبِّئُكُمْ بِتَأْوِيلِهِ فَأَرْسِلُونِ,And he of the two who was released that is of the two young men namely the cup-bearer remembering iddakara the original tā’ of tadhakkara has been changed to a dāl and assimilated with the dhāl after a time after a period of time the predicament of Joseph said ‘I will inform you of its interpretation; so send me forth’ so they sent him forth and he came to Joseph and said
يُوسُفُ أَيُّهَا ٱلصِّدِّيقُ أَفْتِنَا فِي سَبْعِ بَقَرَاتٍ سِمَانٍ يَأْكُلُهُنَّ سَبْعٌ عِجَافٌ وَسَبْعِ سُنبُلاَتٍ خُضْرٍ وَأُخَرَ يَابِسَاتٍ لَّعَلِّيۤ أَرْجِعُ إِلَى ٱلنَّاسِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَعْلَمُونَ,‘O Joseph O truthful one one given to truth give us your opinion concerning seven fat kine that are devoured by seven lean ones and concerning seven green ears of corn and seven others dry that I may return to the people that is to the king and his courtiers so that they might know’ its interpretation.
قَالَ تَزْرَعُونَ سَبْعُ سِنِينَ دَأَباً فَمَا حَصَدتُّمْ فَذَرُوهُ فِي سُنبُلِهِ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً مِّمَّا تَأْكُلُونَ,He said ‘You shall sow — that is go ahead and sow — seven years consecutively — and this was the interpretation of the seven fat ones — but that which you reap leave it in the ear lest it spoil except for a little which you eat thresh it.
ثُمَّ يَأْتِي مِن بَعْدِ ذٰلِكَ سَبْعٌ شِدَادٌ يَأْكُلْنَ مَا قَدَّمْتُمْ لَهُنَّ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً مِّمَّا تُحْصِنُونَ,Then after that in other words after the seven fertile years there shall come seven hard barren and unyielding years — the interpretation of the seven lean ones — which shall devour what you set aside for them of grain sown during the fertile years in other words you shall eat all this during these seven hard years all except a little which you have preserved stored.
ثُمَّ يَأْتِي مِن بَعْدِ ذٰلِكَ عَامٌ فِيهِ يُغَاثُ ٱلنَّاسُ وَفِيهِ يَعْصِرُونَ,Then after that in other words after the seven barren years there shall come a year in which the people will be granted relief through rain and in which they will press fruit grapes and other seeds because of its that year’s fertility.
وَقَالَ ٱلْمَلِكُ ٱئْتُونِي بِهِ فَلَمَّا جَآءَهُ ٱلرَّسُولُ قَالَ ٱرْجِعْ إِلَىٰ رَبِّكَ فَاسْأَلْهُ مَا بَالُ ٱلنِّسْوَةِ ٱللاَّتِي قَطَّعْنَ أَيْدِيَهُنَّ إِنَّ رَبِّي بِكَيْدِهِنَّ عَلِيمٌ,And the king after the messenger had come to him and informed him of its the dream’s interpretation said ‘Bring him to me!’ that is the one who interpreted it. And when the messenger came to him that is to Joseph and summoned him in order to depart from the prison he said — with the intention of manifesting his innocence — ‘Return to your lord and ask him to inquire “What of what was the case with the women who cut their hands?” Surely my lord my master has knowledge of their guile’; he the messenger thus returned and informed the king who then summoned them the women.
قَالَ مَا خَطْبُكُنَّ إِذْ رَاوَدتُّنَّ يُوسُفَ عَن نَّفْسِهِ قُلْنَ حَاشَ لِلَّهِ مَا عَلِمْنَا عَلَيْهِ مِن سُوۤءٍ قَالَتِ ٱمْرَأَتُ ٱلْعَزِيزِ ٱلآنَ حَصْحَصَ ٱلْحَقُّ أَنَاْ رَاوَدْتُّهُ عَن نَّفْسِهِ وَإِنَّهُ لَمِنَ ٱلصَّادِقِينَ,He said ‘What was your business women when you solicited Joseph?’ did you find on his part any inclination towards you? ‘God preserve us!’ they said. ‘We know of no evil in him.’ The Court Officer’s wife said ‘Now the truth is out now it has become clear; it was I who attempted to seduce him and he is indeed of the truthful’ in his saying It was she who attempted to seduce me Q. 1226. Joseph was then informed of this and he said
ذٰلِكَ لِيَعْلَمَ أَنِّي لَمْ أَخُنْهُ بِٱلْغَيْبِ وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ لاَ يَهْدِي كَيْدَ ٱلْخَائِنِينَ,‘That plea of innocence is so that he the Court officer may know I did not betray him with regard to his family in his absence bi’l-ghayb is a circumstantial qualifier and that truly God does not guide to success the guile of the treacherous; he Joseph then humbled himself before God and said
وَمَآ أُبَرِّىءُ نَفْسِيۤ إِنَّ ٱلنَّفْسَ لأَمَّارَةٌ بِٱلسُّوۤءِ إِلاَّ مَا رَحِمَ رَبِّيۤ إِنَّ رَبِّي غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,Yet I do not exculpate my own soul of slipping into error; verily the soul as such is ever inciting to evil except that whereon meaning the person upon whom my Lord has mercy and so protects from sin. Truly my Lord is Forgiving Merciful’.
وَقَالَ ٱلْمَلِكُ ٱئْتُونِي بِهِ أَسْتَخْلِصْهُ لِنَفْسِي فَلَمَّا كَلَّمَهُ قَالَ إِنَّكَ ٱلْيَوْمَ لَدَيْنَا مَكِينٌ أَمِينٌ,And the king said ‘Bring him to me that I may use him for myself’ that I may make him mine exclusively with none to share him with me. The messenger came to him to Joseph and said ‘Respond to the king!’ and so he got up and bid farewell to his fellow-prisoners and prayed for them. He then washed himself put on some good clothes and entered upon him. And when he had spoken with him he said to him ‘Indeed you are on this day in our presence established and trustworthy’ a person of status entrusted over our affair so what do you think we should do? He said ‘Gather food stocks and sow abundantly in these fertile years then store the corn in its ears. People from far and wide will come to you and ask you to supply them with provisions’. He the king said ‘Whom can I delegate this task to?’
قَالَ ٱجْعَلْنِي عَلَىٰ خَزَآئِنِ ٱلأَرْضِ إِنِّي حَفِيظٌ عَلِيمٌ,He Joseph said ‘Place me in charge of the storehouses of the land the land of Egypt. I am indeed a skilled custodian’ one worthy of custodianship thereof and knowledgeable in such affairs — it is also said that he meant I am indeed a competent scribe and accountant.
وَكَذٰلِكَ مَكَّنَّا لِيُوسُفَ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ يَتَبَوَّأُ مِنْهَا حَيْثُ يَشَآءُ نُصِيبُ بِرَحْمَتِنَا مَن نَشَآءُ وَلاَ نُضِيعُ أَجْرَ ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,Thus in the same way that We were graceful towards Him by delivering him from prison We established Joseph in the land the land of Egypt that he may settle in it wherever he wished after having suffered hardship and imprisonment. According to the story the king crowned him gave him a signet-ring to wear and appointed him in place of the Court officer whom he removed from his position and who later died; and so he the king made him Joseph take the latter’s spouse as a wife. He Joseph discovered that she was still a virgin and she bore him two children. He Joseph established justice in Egypt and people became subject to him. We confer Our mercy on whomever We will and We do not waste the wage of the virtuous.
وَلأَجْرُ ٱلآخِرَةِ خَيْرٌ لِّلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَكَانُواْ يَتَّقُونَ,Yet the wage of the Hereafter is better than the wage of this world for those who believe and are God-fearing. And so the years of drought arrived and afflicted the land of Canaan and Syria.
وَجَآءَ إِخْوَةُ يُوسُفَ فَدَخَلُواْ عَلَيْهِ فَعَرَفَهُمْ وَهُمْ لَهُ مُنكِرُونَ,And Joseph’s brothers came — except for Benjamin — in order to secure provisions when they found out that the new Court officer of Egypt was providing food at its fair price; and they entered to him and he recognised them to be his brothers but they did not recognise him not knowing who he was because it had been a long time since they had seen him and because they supposed that he had died. They spoke to him in Hebrew and he said to them as if reproaching them ‘What brings you to my land?’ They replied ‘We have come for supplies’. He said ‘You might be spies!’ They said ‘God forbid!’ He said ‘So where are you from?’ They said ‘From the land of Canaan our father is Jacob the prophet of God.’ He said ‘Does he have children other than you?’ They said ‘Yes. We used to be twelve but the youngest of us passed away he perished in the wild. He was the most beloved to him our father from among us; only his full brother remains and so he keeps him by his side in order to comfort himself with him in place of the other.’ He Joseph commanded that they be given lodging and treated well.
وَلَمَّا جَهَّزَهُم بِجَهَازِهِمْ قَالَ ٱئْتُونِي بِأَخٍ لَّكُمْ مِّنْ أَبِيكُمْ أَلاَ تَرَوْنَ أَنِّيۤ أُوفِي ٱلْكَيْلَ وَأَنَاْ خَيْرُ ٱلْمُنْزِلِينَ,And when he had equipped them with their provision when he had given them the full measure of food he said ‘Bring me a brother of yours from your father namely Benjamin that I might know that you have been truthful in what you said. Do you not see that I give the full measure that I complete it without any fraud and that I am the best of hosts?
فَإِن لَّمْ تَأْتُونِي بِهِ فَلاَ كَيْلَ لَكُمْ عِندِي وَلاَ تَقْرَبُونِ,But if you do not bring him to me there will be no measure that is no provisions for you with me; and do not come near me’ wa-lā taqrabūn is either a prohibition or a supplement to the syntactical locus of fa-lā kayla in other words ‘and you shall be denied the measure and will not be allowed to come near me’.
قَالُواْ سَنُرَاوِدُ عَنْهُ أَبَاهُ وَإِنَّا لَفَاعِلُونَ,They said ‘We will try to tempt his father away from him that is we will try our hardest to seek him from him. That we will surely do’.
وَقَالَ لِفِتْيَانِهِ ٱجْعَلُواْ بِضَاعَتَهُمْ فِي رِحَالِهِمْ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَعْرِفُونَهَآ إِذَا ٱنْقَلَبُوۤاْ إِلَىٰ أَهْلِهِمْ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ,And he said to his young men li-fityatihi a variant reading has li-fityānihi ‘his servants’ ‘Place their merchandise that money with which they bought the supplies and these were a few dirhams in their saddlebags their supply sacks so that they may recognise it when they return to their folk and empty their sacks and so come back’ to us deeming it unlawful to retain these monies.
فَلَمَّا رَجَعُوا إِلَىٰ أَبِيهِمْ قَالُواْ يٰأَبَانَا مُنِعَ مِنَّا ٱلْكَيْلُ فَأَرْسِلْ مَعَنَآ أَخَانَا نَكْتَلْ وَإِنَّا لَهُ لَحَافِظُونَ,So when they went back to their father they said ‘O father the measure will be denied us unless you send forth our brother to him to the Court officer; so send forth our brother with us that we may obtain the measure read naktal or yaktal ‘that he may obtain the measure for us’. Surely we will guard him well’.
قَالَ هَلْ آمَنُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ إِلاَّ كَمَآ أَمِنتُكُمْ عَلَىٰ أَخِيهِ مِن قَبْلُ فَٱللَّهُ خَيْرٌ حَافِظاً وَهُوَ أَرْحَمُ ٱلرَّاحِمِينَ,He said ‘Should I — I will only — trust you with him like I trusted you with his brother Joseph before? despite the fact that you have done to him what you have done? Yet God is best at guarding hifzan a variant reading has hāfizan ‘a guardian’ as a specification similar to when they say li’Llāhi darruhu fārisan ‘By God how excellent a horseman he is!’; and He is the Most Merciful of merciful ones’ and so I hope that He will show favour to me by guarding him.
وَلَمَّا فَتَحُواْ مَتَاعَهُمْ وَجَدُواْ بِضَاعَتَهُمْ رُدَّتْ إِلَيْهِمْ قَالُواْ يٰأَبَانَا مَا نَبْغِي هَـٰذِهِ بِضَاعَتُنَا رُدَّتْ إِلَيْنَا وَنَمِيرُ أَهْلَنَا وَنَحْفَظُ أَخَانَا وَنَزْدَادُ كَيْلَ بَعِيرٍ ذٰلِكَ كَيْلٌ يَسِيرٌ,And when they opened their belongings they found that their merchandise had been restored to them. They said ‘O father what more should we desire? mā nabghī mā is interrogative that is to say what greater thing than this can we ask for from the king’s generosity?’; a variant reading has mā tabghī ‘what more do you desire?’ as an address to Jacob — for they had mentioned to him his the king’s generosity towards them. Here is our merchandise restored to us. And we shall get provisions for our family we shall obtain supplies for them namely food and guard our brother and we shall receive an extra camel’s load because of our brother; that will be an easy measure’ for the king to grant us given his munificence.
قَالَ لَنْ أُرْسِلَهُ مَعَكُمْ حَتَّىٰ تُؤْتُونِ مَوْثِقاً مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ لَتَأْتُنَّنِي بِهِ إِلاَّ أَن يُحَاطَ بِكُمْ فَلَمَّآ آتَوْهُ مَوْثِقَهُمْ قَالَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ مَا نَقُولُ وَكِيلٌ,He said ‘I will not send him with you until you give me a solemn pledge a covenant in the name of God by your swearing an oath that assuredly you will bring him back to me unless you are besieged’ such that you die or are overwhelmed and thus unable to bring him back. They agreed to this. And when they gave him their solemn pledge to this effect he said ‘God shall be Guardian Witness over what we say’ we and you. Thus he sent him with them.
وَقَالَ يٰبَنِيَّ لاَ تَدْخُلُواْ مِن بَابٍ وَاحِدٍ وَٱدْخُلُواْ مِنْ أَبْوَابٍ مُّتَفَرِّقَةٍ وَمَآ أُغْنِي عَنكُمْ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ مِن شَيْءٍ إِنِ ٱلْحُكْمُ إِلاَّ للَّهِ عَلَيْهِ تَوَكَّلْتُ وَعَلَيْهِ فَلْيَتَوَكَّلِ ٱلْمُتَوَكِّلُونَ,And he said ‘O my sons do not enter Egypt by one gate but enter by separate gates lest the evil eye smite you. Yet I cannot avail protect you by this that I have said against God min Allāhi min is extra anything which He might have decreed against you; this that I have said is only out of affection for you. Judgement belongs to God alone. On Him I rely in Him I trust and on Him let all the trusting rely’.
وَلَمَّا دَخَلُواْ مِنْ حَيْثُ أَمَرَهُمْ أَبُوهُم مَّا كَانَ يُغْنِي عَنْهُمْ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ مِن شَيْءٍ إِلاَّ حَاجَةً فِي نَفْسِ يَعْقُوبَ قَضَاهَا وَإِنَّهُ لَذُو عِلْمٍ لِّمَا عَلَّمْنَاهُ وَلَـٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ ٱلنَّاسِ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ,God exalted be He says And when they entered in the manner which their father had bidden them that is separately it did not avail them anything min shay’in min is extra against God that is against His decree; it was but a need in Jacob’s soul which he thus satisfied and this need was his desire to fend off the evil eye from them out of affection for them. And verily he was possessed of knowledge because We had taught him; but most of mankind — and they are the disbelievers — do not know about God’s inspiring His elect.
وَلَمَّا دَخَلُواْ عَلَىٰ يُوسُفَ آوَىۤ إِلَيْهِ أَخَاهُ قَالَ إِنِّيۤ أَنَاْ أَخُوكَ فَلاَ تَبْتَئِسْ بِمَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ,And when they entered to Joseph he took his brother into his arms saying to him ‘Truly it is me your brother therefore do not despair do not be grieved at what they did’ in the way of envying us. He commanded him not to tell them anything and he Joseph agreed with him that he would devise a trick to keep him Benjamin with him.
فَلَمَّا جَهَّزَهُمْ بِجَهَازِهِمْ جَعَلَ ٱلسِّقَايَةَ فِي رَحْلِ أَخِيهِ ثُمَّ أَذَّنَ مُؤَذِّنٌ أَيَّتُهَا ٱلْعِيرُ إِنَّكُمْ لَسَارِقُونَ,And when he had equipped them with their provision he put the drinking-cup a golden cup studded with jewels into the saddlebag of his brother Benjamin. Then a crier shouted a herald cried after they were dismissed from Joseph’s court ‘O cameleers caravan you are surely thieves!’
قَالُواْ وَأَقْبَلُواْ عَلَيْهِمْ مَّاذَا تَفْقِدُونَ,They said after coming towards them ‘What is it that you are missing?’
قَالُواْ نَفْقِدُ صُوَاعَ ٱلْمَلِكِ وَلِمَن جَآءَ بِهِ حِمْلُ بَعِيرٍ وَأَنَاْ بِهِ زَعِيمٌ,They said ‘We are missing the king’s goblet his cup. And he who brings it shall have a camel’s load of food supplies and I will guarantee that’ the camel’s load.
قَالُواْ تَٱللَّهِ لَقَدْ عَلِمْتُمْ مَّا جِئْنَا لِنُفْسِدَ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَمَا كُنَّا سَارِقِينَ,They said ‘By God’ ta’Llāhi is an oath entailing astonishment ‘You know very well that we did not come to work corruption in the land and we are certainly not thieves’ that is we have never stolen anything.
قَالُواْ فَمَا جَزَآؤُهُ إِن كُنتُمْ كَاذِبِينَ,They the crier and his men said ‘So what shall be his requital that is the thief’s if you prove to have been liars?’ when you said ‘we are certainly not thieves’ and if it is found among your belongings?
قَالُواْ جَزَآؤُهُ مَن وُجِدَ فِي رَحْلِهِ فَهُوَ جَزَاؤُهُ كَذٰلِكَ نَجْزِي ٱلظَّالِمِينَ,They said ‘His requital qālū jazā’uhu the subject the predicate of which is the following man wujida fī rahlihi shall be the requital of him in whose saddlebag it is found that he be enslaved — this is then reiterated by His words He the thief shall be the requital for it that is for the stolen item and nothing else this was the customary practice of the family of Jacob. Thus with such a requital do we requite those who do evil’ through theft. They thus permitted Joseph to have their saddlebags searched.
فَبَدَأَ بِأَوْعِيَتِهِمْ قَبْلَ وِعَآءِ أَخِيهِ ثُمَّ ٱسْتَخْرَجَهَا مِن وِعَآءِ أَخِيهِ كَذٰلِكَ كِدْنَا لِيُوسُفَ مَا كَانَ لِيَأْخُذَ أَخَاهُ فِي دِينِ ٱلْمَلِكِ إِلاَّ أَن يَشَآءَ ٱللَّهُ نَرْفَعُ دَرَجَاتٍ مَّن نَّشَآءُ وَفَوْقَ كُلِّ ذِي عِلْمٍ عَلِيمٌ,And so he began with their sacks and searched them before his brother’s sack lest he be accused of the theft; then he pulled it the drinking-cup out of his brother’s sack. God exalted be He says Thus through such contrivance did We contrive for Joseph thus We taught him how to devise a plot to take his brother; he Joseph could not have taken his brother as a slave on account of theft according to the king’s law according to the laws of the king of Egypt — since his a thief’s requital according to his law would have been a beating and a penalty of twice the value of the stolen item but not enslavement — unless God willed for him to be taken according to the law of his father Jacob; in other words he was only able to take him with God’s will by God’s inspiring him to ask his brothers about the nature of requital and their responding according to what is decreed by their customary practice. We raise by degrees whom We will read with a genitive annexation darajāti man nashā’ or simply with nunation darajātin man nashā’ in terms of knowledge as We did with Joseph; and above every man of knowledge from among creatures is one who knows better better than him and so on until it ends with God exalted be He.
قَالُوۤاْ إِن يَسْرِقْ فَقَدْ سَرَقَ أَخٌ لَّهُ مِن قَبْلُ فَأَسَرَّهَا يُوسُفُ فِي نَفْسِهِ وَلَمْ يُبْدِهَا لَهُمْ قَالَ أَنْتُمْ شَرٌّ مَّكَاناً وَٱللَّهُ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا تَصِفُونَ,They said ‘If he is stealing a brother of his stole before’ that is Joseph — he had stolen a golden idol from his maternal grandfather and smashed it lest he worship it. But Joseph kept it secret in his soul and did not disclose it manifest it to them the suffixed pronoun in yubdi-hā ‘disclose it’ refers to the words in his following saying; he said within himself ‘You are a worse case than Joseph and his brother because of your stealing a brother of yours from your father and your wronging him. And God knows very well what you are describing’ what you are mentioning with regard to him.
قَالُواْ يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلْعَزِيزُ إِنَّ لَهُ أَباً شَيْخاً كَبِيراً فَخُذْ أَحَدَنَا مَكَانَهُ إِنَّا نَرَاكَ مِنَ ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,They said ‘O Court officer lo! he has a father an aged man who loves him more than we do and who finds solace in him from the anguish he feels for his dead son; and it will grieve him to part with him so take one of us enslave him in his place instead of him indeed we see that you are among the virtuous’ in terms of your actions.
قَالَ مَعَاذَ ٱللَّهِ أَن نَّأْخُذَ إِلاَّ مَن وَجَدْنَا مَتَاعَنَا عِندَهُ إِنَّـآ إِذاً لَّظَالِمُونَ,He said ‘God forbid ma‘ādha’Llāhi lit. ‘refuge is with God’ is in the accusative because it is a verbal noun the verb having been omitted and placed in a genitive annexation with its direct object in other words understand it as na‘ūdhu bi’Llāhi ‘we seek refuge with God’ that we should take anyone save him with whom we found our property — he did not say ‘save him who stole our property’ being careful not to lie; for then truly — if we were to take anyone other than him — we would be evildoers’.
فَلَمَّا ٱسْتَيْأَسُواْ مِنْهُ خَلَصُواْ نَجِيّاً قَالَ كَبِيرُهُمْ أَلَمْ تَعْلَمُوۤاْ أَنَّ أَبَاكُمْ قَدْ أَخَذَ عَلَيْكُمْ مَّوْثِقاً مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَمِن قَبْلُ مَا فَرَّطتُمْ فِي يُوسُفَ فَلَنْ أَبْرَحَ ٱلأَرْضَ حَتَّىٰ يَأْذَنَ لِيۤ أَبِيۤ أَوْ يَحْكُمَ ٱللَّهُ لِي وَهُوَ خَيْرُ ٱلْحَاكِمِينَ,So when they despaired of moving him they withdrew to confer privately together najiyyan is a verbal noun that can be used to refer to one person or more in other words understand it as meaning yunājī ba‘duhum ba‘dan ‘one conferring with the other’. The most senior of them in years — Reuben — or the most senior of them in opinion — Judah said ‘Are you not aware that your father has taken a solemn pledge a covenant from you by God concerning your brother and formerly wa-min qablu mā the mā is extra you failed regarding Joseph? but it the mā is also said to be relating to the verbal action in other words it is a subject the predicate of which is min qabl ‘formerly’. So I will never leave part with this land the land of Egypt until my father permits me to return to him or God judges for me through the deliverance of my brother; and He is the best the fairest of judges.
ٱرْجِعُوۤاْ إِلَىٰ أَبِيكُمْ فَقُولُواْ يٰأَبَانَا إِنَّ ٱبْنَكَ سَرَقَ وَمَا شَهِدْنَآ إِلاَّ بِمَا عَلِمْنَا وَمَا كُنَّا لِلْغَيْبِ حَافِظِينَ,Go back to your father and say “O our father your son has indeed stolen and we testified against him only regarding what we knew from the certainty of having seen the king’s cup in his saddlebag; we could not have guarded against the Unseen that which was hidden from us when we gave our pledge had we known that he would steal we would not have taken him with us to Egypt.
وَسْئَلِ ٱلْقَرْيَةَ ٱلَّتِي كُنَّا فِيهَا وَٱلْعِيْرَ ٱلَّتِيۤ أَقْبَلْنَا فِيهَا وَإِنَّا لَصَادِقُونَ,And ask the city in which we were — namely Egypt — in other words send forth someone to ask its people and the caravan the men of the caravan with which we approached — and these were a group of Canaanites. Surely we speak the truth” ’ in what we say. So they went back to him and told him as much.
قَالَ بَلْ سَوَّلَتْ لَكُمْ أَنفُسُكُمْ أَمْراً فَصَبْرٌ جَمِيلٌ عَسَى ٱللَّهُ أَن يَأْتِيَنِي بِهِمْ جَمِيعاً إِنَّهُ هُوَ ٱلْعَلِيمُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ,‘Nay’ he said ‘but your souls have beguiled you into have adorned for you something and you did it he accused them because of what had happened with them before concerning Joseph. Yet comely patience will be my course of patience! It may be that God will bring them Joseph and his two brothers all back to me. Indeed He is the Knower of my predicament the Wise’ in His actions.
وَتَوَلَّىٰ عَنْهُمْ وَقَالَ يَٰأَسَفَىٰ عَلَى يُوسُفَ وَٱبْيَضَّتْ عَيْنَاهُ مِنَ ٱلْحُزْنِ فَهُوَ كَظِيمٌ,And he turned away from them no longer addressing them and said ‘Alas my grief for Joseph!’ yā asafā the final alif of asafā has taken the place of the possessive yā’ of genitive annexation sc. yā asafī in other words it means yā huznī ‘O my sorrow’. And his eyes turned white their dark colour was effaced and became white on account of his tears with grief for him such that he was filled with suppressed agony anguished and grief-stricken but not manifesting his grief.
قَالُواْ تَاللهِ تَفْتَؤُاْ تَذْكُرُ يُوسُفَ حَتَّىٰ تَكُونَ حَرَضاً أَوْ تَكُونَ مِنَ ٱلْهَالِكِينَ,They said ‘By God you will never cease remembering Joseph until you are consumed on the verge of perishing on account of your illness it haradan ‘consumed’ is a verbal noun equally applicable to one person or more or you are of those who perish’ of the dead.
قَالَ إِنَّمَآ أَشْكُو بَثِّي وَحُزْنِي إِلَى ٱللَّهِ وَأَعْلَمُ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ مَا لاَ تَعْلَمُونَ,He said to them ‘I complain of my anguish — bathth is severe grief which cannot be endured unless it is proclaimed yubaththu to others — and grief only to God not to any other than Him for it is worth complaining to Him; and I know from God what you do not know and that is that Joseph’s dream is true and that he is alive. Then he said
يٰبَنِيَّ ٱذْهَبُواْ فَتَحَسَّسُواْ مِن يُوسُفَ وَأَخِيهِ وَلاَ تَيْأَسُواْ مِن رَّوْحِ ٱللَّهِ إِنَّهُ لاَ يَيْأَسُ مِن رَّوْحِ ٱللَّهِ إِلاَّ ٱلْقَوْمُ ٱلْكَافِرُونَ,O my sons go and enquire about Joseph and his brother seek news of them and do not despair of God’s gracious Spirit His mercy. Indeed none despairs of the gracious Spirit of God save the disbelieving folk’ and so they departed to Egypt to look for Joseph.
فَلَمَّا دَخَلُواْ عَلَيْهِ قَالُواْ يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلْعَزِيزُ مَسَّنَا وَأَهْلَنَا ٱلضُّرُّ وَجِئْنَا بِبِضَاعَةٍ مُّزْجَاةٍ فَأَوْفِ لَنَا ٱلْكَيْلَ وَتَصَدَّقْ عَلَيْنَآ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَجْزِي ٱلْمُتَصَدِّقِينَ,And so when they entered to him they said ‘O Court officer misfortune hunger has befallen us and our family; and we have come with reject merchandise refused by any person who sees it because of its worthlessness — it consisted of counterfeit dirhams or something else — so fill up complete for us the measure and be charitable to us by overlooking the worthlessness of our merchandise; truly God requites the charitable’ He rewards them he Joseph thus took pity on them and he was overtaken by compassion for them and removed the partition between them and himself.
قَالَ هَلْ عَلِمْتُمْ مَّا فَعَلْتُم بِيُوسُفَ وَأَخِيهِ إِذْ أَنتُمْ جَاهِلُونَ,Then he said to them in rebuke ‘Do you realise what you did to Joseph in the way of beating him and selling him and otherwise and his brother oppressing him after having separated him from his brother while you were ignorant?’ of where the affair of Joseph will lead?
قَالُوۤاْ أَءِنَّكَ لأَنتَ يُوسُفُ قَالَ أَنَاْ يُوسُفُ وَهَـٰذَا أَخِي قَدْ مَنَّ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْنَآ إِنَّهُ مَن يَتَّقِ وَيَصْبِرْ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لاَ يُضِيعُ أَجْرَ ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,They said — after recognising him by his noble traits — cautiously inquiring ‘Is it really read a-innaka either pronouncing both hamzas or by not pronouncing the second but in both cases inserting an alif you Joseph?’. He said ‘I am indeed Joseph and this is my brother. God has truly shown favour He has been gracious to us by bringing us together. Verily if one fears if one fears God and endures what happens to him God does not waste the wage of those who are virtuous’ in this respect the overt noun al-muhsinīn ‘the virtuous’ has replaced the third person pronominalisation.
قَالُواْ تَٱللَّهِ لَقَدْ آثَرَكَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْنَا وَإِن كُنَّا لَخَاطِئِينَ,They said ‘By God truly God has preferred you over us with kingship and in other ways and indeed we wa-in in is softened in other words it is understood as innā ‘indeed we’ have been erring’ sinful towards you and treated you disgracefully.
قَالَ لاَ تَثْرِيبَ عَلَيْكُمُ ٱلْيَوْمَ يَغْفِرُ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمْ وَهُوَ أَرْحَمُ ٱلرَّاحِمِينَ,He said ‘There shall be no reproach no blame on you this day — he specifically mentions this day because it was the day when they expected to be reproached although any other day would have been more appropriate for them to be reproached on. God will forgive you and He is the Most Merciful of the merciful.
ٱذْهَبُواْ بِقَمِيصِي هَـٰذَا فَأَلْقُوهُ عَلَىٰ وَجْهِ أَبِي يَأْتِ بَصِيراً وَأْتُونِي بِأَهْلِكُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ,He Joseph asked them about his father; and they told him that his eyesight had gone. And so he said Go with this shirt of mine — and this was the shirt of Abraham the one he wore when he was thrown into the fire; he Joseph had it around his neck when he was at the bottom of the well. It the shirt had come from Paradise Gabriel commanded him Joseph to send it off to Jacob saying that the scent of Paradise lingers in it and whenever it is cast upon a sufferer it heals him — and lay it on my father’s face and he will recover his sight; and bring me all your folk’.
وَلَمَّا فَصَلَتِ ٱلْعِيرُ قَالَ أَبُوهُمْ إِنِّي لأَجِدُ رِيحَ يُوسُفَ لَوْلاَ أَن تُفَنِّدُونِ,And as the caravan set forth leaving behind the palm fields of Egypt their father said to those of his sons and their children present ‘Truly I sense the scent of Joseph — which the east wind had brought to him with God’s permission across a distance of three or eight or more days’ journey; if only you did not think me doting’ if only you did not regard me as foolish you would believe me.
قَالُواْ تَٱللَّهِ إِنَّكَ لَفِي ضَلاَلِكَ ٱلْقَدِيمِ,They said to him ‘By God you are certainly in your misguidance your error of old’ in your excessive adoration of him and your enduring hope of encountering him again despite the length of time that has passed.
فَلَمَّآ أَن جَآءَ ٱلْبَشِيرُ أَلْقَاهُ عَلَىٰ وَجْهِهِ فَٱرْتَدَّ بَصِيراً قَالَ أَلَمْ أَقُلْ لَّكُمْ إِنِّيۤ أَعْلَمُ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ مَا لاَ تَعْلَمُونَ,Then when fa-lammā an an is extra the bearer of good tidings Judah came with the shirt — he had been the one who brought the blood-stained shirt and so now he wished to bring him joy after he had previously brought him grief — he laid it he cast the shirt on his face and he regained his sight. He said ‘Did I not say to you “Indeed I know from God what you do not know?” ’
قَالُواْ يٰأَبَانَا ٱسْتَغْفِرْ لَنَا ذُنُوبَنَآ إِنَّا كُنَّا خَاطِئِينَ,They said ‘O our father ask forgiveness for us of our sins; truly we have been sinful’.
قَالَ سَوْفَ أَسْتَغْفِرُ لَكُمْ رَبِّيۤ إِنَّهُ هُوَ ٱلْغَفُورُ ٱلرَّحِيمُ,He said ‘Assuredly I shall ask forgiveness for you of my Lord. Lo! He is the Forgiving the Merciful’ he Jacob put off this plea of forgiveness until the last hour before dawn in order to be closer to the likelihood of it being accepted or he put it off until the eve of Friday. They then departed for Egypt where Joseph and the senior courtiers came out to meet them.
فَلَمَّا دَخَلُواْ عَلَىٰ يُوسُفَ آوَىٰ إِلَيْهِ أَبَوَيْهِ وَقَالَ ٱدْخُلُواْ مِصْرَ إِن شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ آمِنِينَ,And when they entered to Joseph in his tent he took his parents his father and his mother — or and his maternal aunt — into his arms and said to them ‘Enter into Egypt if God will in safety’ and they entered and Joseph sat down on his throne.
وَرَفَعَ أَبَوَيْهِ عَلَى ٱلْعَرْشِ وَخَرُّواْ لَهُ سُجَّدَاً وَقَالَ يٰأَبَتِ هَـٰذَا تَأْوِيلُ رُؤْيَايَ مِن قَبْلُ قَدْ جَعَلَهَا رَبِّي حَقّاً وَقَدْ أَحْسَنَ بَيۤ إِذْ أَخْرَجَنِي مِنَ ٱلسِّجْنِ وَجَآءَ بِكُمْ مِّنَ ٱلْبَدْوِ مِن بَعْدِ أَن نَّزغَ ٱلشَّيْطَانُ بَيْنِي وَبَيْنَ إِخْوَتِيۤ إِنَّ رَبِّي لَطِيفٌ لِّمَا يَشَآءُ إِنَّهُ هُوَ ٱلْعَلِيمُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ,And he raised his parents he seated them next to him upon the throne and they fell down that is his parents and brothers prostrating before him — a prostration that was actually a bowing down not placing their foreheads down on the ground; this was their standard form of greeting at that time. Then he said ‘O father this is the interpretation of my vision of old. Indeed my Lord has made it true. And indeed He has been gracious to me since He brought me out of the prison — he did not say ‘out of the well’ in a show of magnanimity lest his brothers feel ashamed — and has brought you from the desert after Satan had incited ill feeling made trouble between me and my brethren. Truly my Lord is Subtle in bringing about what He will. Truly He is the Knower of His creatures the Wise in His actions. His father Jacob remained with him for 24 years or for 17 years. The duration of his separation from Joseph had been 18 or 40 or 80 years. When death approached him he charged Joseph to take him and bury him by his father Isaac and so he Joseph himself went and buried him there. He Joseph then returned to Egypt and remained alive for another 23 years.
رَبِّ قَدْ آتَيْتَنِي مِنَ ٱلْمُلْكِ وَعَلَّمْتَنِي مِن تَأْوِيلِ ٱلأَحَادِيثِ فَاطِرَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ أَنتَ وَلِيِّي فِي ٱلدُّنُيَا وَٱلآخِرَةِ تَوَفَّنِى مُسْلِماً وَأَلْحِقْنِي بِٱلصَّالِحِينَ,When he was nearing his end realising that he would not remain alive forever he longed for the everlasting kingdom and said My Lord indeed You have given me something of sovereignty and You have taught me the interpretation of events the ability to explain dreams. Originator Creator of the heavens and the earth! You are my Protector Guardian of my best interests in this world and the Hereafter. Take me in death to You in submission to You and join me to the righteous’ from among my fathers. He lived after that for another week or more. He died at the age of 120 years. The Egyptians were very covetous with regard to his grave; eventually they placed him in a marble coffin and buried him at the top of the Nile so that both banks would be blessed by his body — Glory be to the One Whose Kingdom never ends.
ذَلِكَ مِنْ أَنْبَآءِ ٱلْغَيْبِ نُوحِيهِ إِلَيْكَ وَمَا كُنتَ لَدَيْهِمْ إِذْ أَجْمَعُوۤاْ أَمْرَهُمْ وَهُمْ يَمْكُرُونَ,That which is mentioned of the matter of Joseph is of the tidings the tales of the Unseen what has been hidden from you O Muhammad (s) which We reveal to you; for you were not with them with Joseph’s brothers when they agreed upon their plan to plot against him that is when they resolved upon it and schemed against him; in other words you were not present among them to know their story and so tell it to others knowledge of it has come to you through revelation.
وَمَآ أَكْثَرُ ٱلنَّاسِ وَلَوْ حَرَصْتَ بِمُؤْمِنِينَ,Yet most people that is the people of Mecca however eager you might be that they believe will not believe.
وَمَا تَسْأَلُهُمْ عَلَيْهِ مِنْ أَجْرٍ إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ ذِكْرٌ لِّلْعَالَمِينَ,Nor do you ask them any wage that you should take for it that is for the Qur’ān — it namely the Qur’ān is but a reminder an admonition to all the worlds.
وَكَأَيِّن مِّن آيَةٍ فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ يَمُرُّونَ عَلَيْهَا وَهُمْ عَنْهَا مُعْرِضُونَ,And how many a sign indicating the Oneness of God is there in the heavens and the earth which they pass by which they witness but disregard! not reflecting upon it.
وَمَا يُؤْمِنُ أَكْثَرُهُمْ بِٱللَّهِ إِلاَّ وَهُمْ مُّشْرِكُونَ,And most of them do not believe in God such that they might affirm that He is the Creator and the Sustainer without ascribing partners to Him by worshipping idols; which is why when crying their ritual response to God they used to say ‘At Your service no partner have You save a partner that belongs to You; You possess him and all that he possesses’ meaning it when they said it.
أَفَأَمِنُوۤاْ أَن تَأْتِيَهُمْ غَاشِيَةٌ مِّنْ عَذَابِ ٱللَّهِ أَوْ تَأْتِيَهُمُ ٱلسَّاعَةُ بَغْتَةً وَهُمْ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ,Do they deem themselves secure from the coming upon them of a pall a calamity enveloping them of God’s chastisement or the coming of the Hour upon them suddenly while they are unaware? of the time of its arrival beforehand?
قُلْ هَـٰذِهِ سَبِيلِيۤ أَدْعُو إِلَىٰ ٱللَّهِ عَلَىٰ بَصِيرَةٍ أَنَاْ وَمَنِ ٱتَّبَعَنِي وَسُبْحَانَ ٱللَّهِ وَمَآ أَنَاْ مِنَ ٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ,Say to them ‘This is my way — which He explains by saying I call to the religion of God being upon sure knowledge plain proof I and whoever follows me whoever believes in me man ittaba‘anī is a supplement to anā ‘I’ the subject predicated by what preceded sc. ‘being upon sure knowledge’. So Glory be to God! in affirmation of His being exalted high above having partners and I am not of the idolaters’ — this sentence is also subsumed by the explanation of his statement about ‘his way’.
وَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ إِلاَّ رِجَالاً نُّوحِيۤ إِلَيْهِمْ مِّنْ أَهْلِ ٱلْقُرَىٰ أَفَلَمْ يَسِيرُواْ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ فَيَنظُرُواْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَاقِبَةُ ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ وَلَدَارُ ٱلآخِرَةِ خَيْرٌ لِّلَّذِينَ ٱتَّقَواْ أَفَلاَ تَعْقِلُونَ,And We did not send before you any messengers save men inspired by revelation yūhā ilayhim a variant reading has nūhī ilayhim ‘to whom We revealed’ — and not angels — from among the people of the towns the principal towns since they are more knowledgeable and wiser than the people of the desert who are crude and ignorant. Have they the people of Mecca not travelled in the land and seen the nature of the consequence for those who were before them? that is how they ended up when they were destroyed for denying their messengers? And verily the abode of the Hereafter that is Paradise is better for those who are wary of God. Will they not understand? read a-fa-lā ya‘qilūn or a-fa-lā ta‘qilūn. ‘Will you not understand?’ this O people of Mecca and so have faith?
حَتَّىٰ إِذَا ٱسْتَيْأَسَ ٱلرُّسُلُ وَظَنُّوۤاْ أَنَّهُمْ قَدْ كُذِبُواْ جَآءَهُمْ نَصْرُنَا فَنُجِّيَ مَن نَّشَآءُ وَلاَ يُرَدُّ بَأْسُنَا عَنِ ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلْمُجْرِمِينَ,Until hattā indicates the end result indicated by the previous statement wa-mā arsalnā min qablika illā rijālan And We did not send before you any messengers save men above Q. 12109 that is to whom Our support waned until when the messengers despaired and thought when the messengers were certain that they were denied read kudhdhibū to mean that they were denied to such an extent that they believed that there would not be any possible acceptance of faith thereafter; or read kudhibū to mean that the communities thought that their messengers had been lied to concerning the victory which they had been promised Our help came to them and whomever We willed We delivered read fa-nunajjī or fa-nunjī; or fa-nujjiya as past tense ‘whomever We wished was delivered’. And Our wrath Our chastisement cannot be averted from the sinning the idolatrous folk.
لَقَدْ كَانَ فِي قَصَصِهِمْ عِبْرَةٌ لأُوْلِي ٱلأَلْبَابِ مَا كَانَ حَدِيثاً يُفْتَرَىٰ وَلَـٰكِن تَصْدِيقَ ٱلَّذِي بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ وَتَفْصِيلَ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ وَهُدًى وَرَحْمَةً لِّقَوْمٍ يُؤْمِنُونَ,Verily there is in their stories that is the messengers’ stories a lesson for people of pith possessors of intellect. It this Qur’ān is not a fabricated an invented discourse but it is a confirmation of what was revealed before it of scriptures and a detailing an elucidation of everything that one needs for the proper observance of religion and a guidance from error and a mercy for a folk who believe such folk are singled out for mention because they are the ones to benefit from it to the exclusion of others.
الۤمۤر تِلْكَ آيَاتُ ٱلْكِتَابِ وَٱلَّذِيۤ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ مِن رَّبِّكَ ٱلْحَقُّ وَلَـٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ ٱلنَّاسِ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ,Alif lām mīm rā’ God knows best what He means by these letters. Those these verses are the verses of the Book the Qur’ān the genitive annexation carries the meaning of partitive min ‘from’ and that which has been revealed to you from your Lord namely the Qur’ān this preceding sentence constitutes the subject the predicate of which is the following is the Truth wherein is no doubt but most people that is the people of Mecca do not believe that it is from God exalted be He.
ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِي رَفَعَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ بِغَيْرِ عَمَدٍ تَرَوْنَهَا ثُمَّ ٱسْتَوَىٰ عَلَى ٱلْعَرْشِ وَسَخَّرَ ٱلشَّمْسَ وَٱلْقَمَرَ كُلٌّ يَجْرِي لأَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّـى يُدَبِّرُ ٱلأَمْرَ يُفَصِّلُ ٱلآيَاتِ لَعَلَّكُمْ بِلِقَآءِ رَبِّكُمْ تُوقِنُونَ,God is He Who raised up the heavens without visible supports ‘amad is the plural of ‘imād which is the same as an ustuwāna ‘a column’; and this statement is true since there are no actual supports then presided upon the Throne a presiding befitting Him and disposed made subservient the sun and the moon each one of them moving along its course until the conclusion of an appointed time that is until the Day of Resurrection. He directs the command He conducts the affairs of His Kingdom. He details He expounds the signs the indications of His power so that you O people of Mecca might be certain of the encounter with your Lord through resurrection.
وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِي مَدَّ ٱلأَرْضَ وَجَعَلَ فِيهَا رَوَاسِىَ وَأَنْهَاراً وَمِن كُلِّ ٱلثَّمَرَاتِ جَعَلَ فِيهَا زَوْجَيْنِ ٱثْنَيْنِ يُغْشِى ٱلَّيلَ ٱلنَّهَارَ إِنَّ فِي ذٰلِكَ لآيَاتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يَتَفَكَّرُونَ,And He it is Who spread out extended flat the earth and set created therein firm mountains and rivers and of every fruit He has made in it two kinds of every species. He covers He cloaks the night and its darkness with the day. Surely in that which is mentioned are signs indications of His Oneness exalted be He for a people who reflect upon God’s handiwork.
وَفِي ٱلأَرْضِ قِطَعٌ مُّتَجَاوِرَاتٌ وَجَنَّاتٌ مِّنْ أَعْنَابٍ وَزَرْعٌ وَنَخِيلٌ صِنْوَانٌ وَغَيْرُ صِنْوَانٍ يُسْقَىٰ بِمَآءٍ وَاحِدٍ وَنُفَضِّلُ بَعْضَهَا عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ فِي ٱلأُكُلِ إِنَّ فِي ذٰلِكَ لآيَاتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يَعْقِلُونَ,And on the earth are tracts diverse terrains neighbouring each other joined side by side some good some briny some of little yield and some fruitful — and these constitute proofs of His power exalted be He — and gardens orchards of vines and sown fields read zar‘un in the nominative as a supplement to jannātun ‘gardens’ or read zar‘in in the genitive as a supplement to a‘nābin ‘of vines’; similarly constituting proofs of His power are His words and date-palms sharing one root sinwān is the plural of sinw which are date-palms belonging to the same root but with many offshoots and date-palms otherwise each of individual root watered read tusqā as referring to jannāt ‘gardens’ and what is in them or read yusqā as referring to the mentioned date-palms by the same source of water; and We make some of them to excel wa-nufaddil or read wa-yufaddil ‘and He God makes some of them to excel’ others in flavour read fī’l-ukul or fī’l-ukl and so some are sweet others bitter — and these are also proofs of His power exalted be He. Surely in that which is mentioned are signs for a people who understand who reflect.
وَإِن تَعْجَبْ فَعَجَبٌ قَوْلُهُمْ أَإِذَا كُنَّا تُرَاباً أَإِنَّا لَفِي خَلْقٍ جَدِيدٍ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ بِرَبِّهِمْ وَأُوْلَئِكَ ٱلأَغْلاَلُ فِيۤ أَعْنَاقِهِمْ وَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ أَصْحَابُ ٱلنَّارِ هُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدونَ,And if you wonder O Muhammad (s) at the disbelievers denying you then surely wondrous surely deserving wonder is their saying in denial of resurrection ‘When we have become dust shall we indeed then be raised in a new creation?’ it is wondrous because the One Who has the power to originate creation and to originate what has been mentioned above without any precedent has also the power to restore them to life both hamzas in both instances a-idhā and a-innā are pronounced; or one may pronounce the first and not pronounce the second but in both cases inserting an alif or not inserting it; one variant reading has the first a-idhā as the interrogative and the second one a-innā as the predicate while another variant reading has the exact opposite. Those are the ones who disbelieve in their Lord; those — fetters shall be around their necks; and those they shall be the inhabitants of the Fire abiding therein.
وَيَسْتَعْجِلُونَكَ بِٱلسَّيِّئَةِ قَبْلَ ٱلْحَسَنَةِ وَقَدْ خَلَتْ مِن قَبْلِهِمُ ٱلْمَثُلاَتُ وَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَذُو مَغْفِرَةٍ لِّلنَّاسِ عَلَىٰ ظُلْمِهِمْ وَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَشَدِيدُ ٱلْعِقَابِ,The following was revealed regarding their hastening on out of mockery of the chastisement And they would have you hasten on the evil the chastisement rather than the good rather than mercy when there have indeed occurred before them exemplary punishments mathulāt is the plural of mathula similar in pattern to samura pl. samurāt ‘acacia’ that is to say the punishments of disbelievers like them will they not take warning from these? Truly your Lord is forgiving to mankind despite their evil-doing for otherwise He would not have left a single creature on the face of it the earth; and truly your Lord is severe in retribution against those who disobey Him.
وَيَقُولُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لَوْلاۤ أُنزِلَ عَلَيْهِ آيَةٌ مِّن رَّبِّهِ إِنَّمَآ أَنتَ مُنذِرٌ وَلِكُلِّ قَوْمٍ هَادٍ,And those who disbelieve say ‘Why has not some sign been sent down upon him upon Muhammad (s) from his Lord!’ the like of the staff and the glowing hand or the she-camel. God exalted be He says You are only a warner one to threaten the disbelievers for it is not your duty to bring forth signs; and for every folk there is a guide a prophet to guide them to their Lord with the signs that He gives him and not what with they request.
ٱللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ مَا تَحْمِلُ كُلُّ أُنثَىٰ وَمَا تَغِيضُ ٱلأَرْحَامُ وَمَا تَزْدَادُ وَكُلُّ شَيْءٍ عِندَهُ بِمِقْدَارٍ,God knows what every female bears of male or female one or more and otherwise and what the wombs reduce of the time of gestation and what they increase of it. And everything with Him is according to a precise measure a precise amount and limit which it does not exceed;
عَالِمُ ٱلْغَيْبِ وَٱلشَّهَادَةِ ٱلْكَبِيرُ ٱلْمُتَعَالِ,He is the Knower of the unseen and the visible of what is hidden and what is witnessed; the Great the Tremendous the High Exalted above His creation through His overpowering subjugation read al-muta‘ālī or al-muta‘āl ‘the High Exalted’.
سَوَآءٌ مِّنْكُمْ مَّنْ أَسَرَّ ٱلْقَوْلَ وَمَنْ جَهَرَ بِهِ وَمَنْ هُوَ مُسْتَخْفٍ بِٱلَّيلِ وَسَارِبٌ بِٱلنَّهَارِ,They are all the same according to His knowledge exalted be He those of you who speak secretly and those who do so openly and those who lurk who hide themselves in the night in its darkness and those who go forth those who are manifest to view when they make their way by day.
لَهُ مُعَقِّبَاتٌ مِّن بَيْنِ يَدَيْهِ وَمِنْ خَلْفِهِ يَحْفَظُونَهُ مِنْ أَمْرِ ٱللَّهِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لاَ يُغَيِّرُ مَا بِقَوْمٍ حَتَّىٰ يُغَيِّرُواْ مَا بِأَنْفُسِهِمْ وَإِذَا أَرَادَ ٱللَّهُ بِقَوْمٍ سُوۤءًا فَلاَ مَرَدَّ لَهُ وَمَا لَهُمْ مِّن دُونِهِ مِن وَالٍ,For him for man are attendants angels who follow him to his front and to his rear guarding him through God’s command that is by His command from the danger of the jinn and others. Indeed God does not alter the state of a people — He does not deprive them of His grace — unless they have altered the state of their souls from their comely nature through an act of disobedience. And if God wills misfortune chastisement for a people there is none that can repel it either from among the attendant angels or others; and they for whom God wills misfortune have no protector min wālin min is extra to avert it from them apart from Him that is other than God.
هُوَ ٱلَّذِي يُرِيكُمُ ٱلْبَرْقَ خَوْفاً وَطَمَعاً وَيُنْشِىءُ ٱلسَّحَابَ ٱلثِّقَالَ,He it is Who shows you the lightning inspiring fear in travellers of thunderbolts and hope for those who are at home of rain; and He produces He creates the clouds that are heavy with rain.
وَيُسَبِّحُ ٱلرَّعْدُ بِحَمْدِهِ وَٱلْمَلاَئِكَةُ مِنْ خِيفَتِهِ وَيُرْسِلُ ٱلصَّوَاعِقَ فَيُصِيبُ بِهَا مَن يَشَآءُ وَهُمْ يُجَٰدِلُونَ فِي ٱللَّهِ وَهُوَ شَدِيدُ ٱلْمِحَالِ,And the thunder — this is an angel who is in charge of the clouds driving them while he constantly proclaims His praise that is he says ‘Glory be to God through His praise’ subhāna’Llāh wa-bi-hamdihi and so too the angels proclaim His praise in awe of Him that is of God. He unleashes the thunderbolts — these are a fire which issues forth from the clouds — and smites with them whom He will such that it burns that person this was revealed regarding a man to whom the Prophet s had sent someone to invite to Islam and who said ‘Who is the Messenger of God? And what is God? Is He made of gold or of silver or of copper?’ whereupon a thunderbolt came down on him and blew off the top of his head; yet they that is the disbelievers dispute argue with the Prophet s about God though He is great in might in power or in the severity of His retribution.
لَهُ دَعْوَةُ ٱلْحَقِّ وَٱلَّذِينَ يَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِهِ لاَ يَسْتَجِيبُونَ لَهُم بِشَيْءٍ إِلاَّ كَبَاسِطِ كَفَّيْهِ إِلَى ٱلْمَآءِ لِيَبْلُغَ فَاهُ وَمَا هُوَ بِبَالِغِهِ وَمَا دُعَآءُ ٱلْكَافِرِينَ إِلاَّ فِي ضَلاَلٍ,His exalted be He is the call of truth that is the words that constitute it the truth and these are ‘there is no god but God’ lā ilāha illā’Llāh; and those upon whom they call read yad‘ūn or tad‘ūn ‘you call’ those whom they worship apart from Him that is other than Him — namely the idols — do not answer them anything of which they ask; save as is the response to one who stretches forth his hands towards water at the edge of a well calling to it that it may reach his mouth by its rising through the well to reach him but it would never reach it that is reach his mouth ever likewise they the idols will not answer them; and the call of the disbelievers their worship of idols — or their actual supplication — goes only astray it is only in perdition.
وَلِلَّهِ يَسْجُدُ مَن فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ طَوْعاً وَكَرْهاً وَظِلالُهُم بِٱلْغُدُوِّ وَٱلآصَالِ,And to God prostrate whoever is in the heavens and the earth willingly such as believers or unwillingly such as hypocrites and those coerced by the sword and their shadows also prostrate in the mornings and the evenings.
قُلْ مَن رَّبُّ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ قُلِ ٱللَّهُ قُلْ أَفَٱتَّخَذْتُمْ مِّن دُونِهِ أَوْلِيَآءَ لاَ يَمْلِكُونَ لأَنْفُسِهِمْ نَفْعاً وَلاَ ضَرّاً قُلْ هَلْ يَسْتَوِي ٱلأَعْمَىٰ وَٱلْبَصِيرُ أَمْ هَلْ تَسْتَوِي ٱلظُّلُمَاتُ وَٱلنُّورُ أَمْ جَعَلُواْ للَّهِ شُرَكَآءَ خَلَقُواْ كَخَلْقِهِ فَتَشَابَهَ ٱلْخَلْقُ عَلَيْهِمْ قُلِ ٱللَّهُ خَالِقُ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ وَهُوَ ٱلْوَاحِدُ ٱلْقَهَّارُ,Say O Muhammad (s) to your people ‘Who is the Lord of the heavens and the earth?’ Say ‘God’ — and even if they do not say it there can be no other response. Say to them ‘Then have you taken beside Him other than Him protectors idols to worship who have no power to benefit or harm themselves?’ and you abandon the One Who is their Possessor? an interrogative meant as a rebuke. Say ‘Are the blind one and the seer respectively the disbeliever and the believer equal? Or are darkness disbelief and the light faith equal? No! Or have they set up for God associates who have created the like of His creation so that creation seems alike that is is what the associates create and the creation of God alike to them?’ so that they believe them worthy of being worshipped on account of what these associates have created? an interrogative of disavowal; in other words not so! None save the Creator is worthy of being worshipped. Say ‘God is the Creator of all things having no associate therein and so He cannot have an associate in terms of worship; and He is the One the Subjugator’ of His servants.
أَنَزَلَ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مَآءً فَسَالَتْ أَوْدِيَةٌ بِقَدَرِهَا فَٱحْتَمَلَ ٱلسَّيْلُ زَبَداً رَّابِياً وَمِمَّا يُوقِدُونَ عَلَيْهِ فِي ٱلنَّارِ ٱبْتِغَآءَ حِلْيَةٍ أَوْ مَتَاعٍ زَبَدٌ مِّثْلُهُ كَذٰلِكَ يَضْرِبُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْحَقَّ وَٱلْبَاطِلَ فَأَمَّا ٱلزَّبَدُ فَيَذْهَبُ جُفَآءً وَأَمَّا مَا يَنفَعُ ٱلنَّاسَ فَيَمْكُثُ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ كَذٰلِكَ يَضْرِبُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلأَمْثَالَ,He then strikes a similitude of truth and falsehood saying He exalted be He sends down water rain from the sky whereat the valleys flow according to their measure according to their full capacity and the flood carries a scum that swells rising above it and this scum is the filth and the like that lies on the surface of the earth and from that which they smelt read tūqidūn ‘you smelt’ or yūqidūn ‘they smelt’ in the fire of the earth’s minerals such as gold silver or copper desiring seeking to make ornaments adornment or ware which is useful such as utensils when they the minerals are melted; there rises a scum the like of it that is the like of the scum of the flood and this latter scum consists of the impurities expelled by the bellows. Thus in the way mentioned God points out truth and falsehood that is He points out the similitude thereof. As for the scum of the flood and of the minerals smelted it passes away as dross useless refuse while that which is of use to mankind in the way of water and minerals lingers remains in the earth for a time likewise falsehood wanes and is eventually effaced even if it should prevail over the truth at certain times. Truth on the other hand is established and enduring. Thus in the way mentioned God strikes He makes clear similitudes.
لِلَّذِينَ ٱسْتَجَابُواْ لِرَبِّهِمُ ٱلْحُسْنَىٰ وَٱلَّذِينَ لَمْ يَسْتَجِيبُواْ لَهُ لَوْ أَنَّ لَهُمْ مَّا فِي ٱلأَرْضِ جَمِيعاً وَمِثْلَهُ مَعَهُ لاَفْتَدَوْاْ بِهِ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ لَهُمْ سُوۤءُ ٱلْحِسَابِ وَمَأْوَاهُمْ جَهَنَّمُ وَبِئْسَ ٱلْمِهَادُ,For those who respond to their Lord those who answer Him by way of obedience there shall be the goodly reward Paradise and those who do not respond to Him namely the disbelievers — if they possessed all that is in the earth and therewith the like of it they would offer it to redeem themselves therewith against the chastisement. For such there shall be an awful reckoning and that is that they will be requited for every single thing they did none of which will be forgiven and their abode shall be Hell an evil resting place it is!
أَفَمَن يَعْلَمُ أَنَّمَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ مِن رَبِّكَ ٱلْحَقُّ كَمَنْ هُوَ أَعْمَىٰ إِنَّمَا يَتَذَكَّرُ أُوْلُواْ ٱلأَلْبَابِ,The following was revealed regarding Hamza and Abū Jahl Is he who knows that what is revealed to you from your Lord is the truth and so believes in it like him who is blind? and does not know it nor believes in it? No! But only people of pith possessors of intellect remember heed such admonitions;
ٱلَّذِينَ يُوفُونَ بِعَهْدِ ٱللَّهِ وَلاَ يَنقُضُونَ ٱلْمِيثَاقَ,such as fulfil God’s covenant meaning the one that was taken from them while they were still atoms — or meaning any covenant — and do not break the pact by abandoning belief or religious obligations;
وَٱلَّذِينَ يَصِلُونَ مَآ أَمَرَ ٱللَّهُ بِهِ أَن يُوصَلَ وَيَخْشَوْنَ رَبَّهُمْ وَيَخَافُونَ سُوءَ الحِسَابِ,and such as cement what God has commanded should be cemented of faith and kinship ties and so forth and fear their Lord that is His Threat of punishment and dread an awful reckoning — a similar statement has preceded;
وَالَّذِينَ صَبَرُواْ ٱبْتِغَاءَ وَجْهِ رَبِّهِمْ وَأَقَامُواْ ٱلصَّلاَةَ وَأَنْفَقُواْ مِمَّا رَزَقْنَاهُمْ سِرّاً وَعَلاَنِيَةً وَيَدْرَءُونَ بِٱلْحَسَنَةِ ٱلسَّيِّئَةَ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ لَهُمْ عُقْبَىٰ ٱلدَّارِ,such as are patient through obedience and during hardship and staying away from disobedience desiring seeking their Lord’s countenance and nothing else from among the transient things of this world; and maintain the prayer and expend in obedience of that which We have provided them secretly and openly and repel evil with good such as repelling ignorance through forbearance and harm through patience; those theirs shall be the sequel of the heavenly Abode that is the praiseworthy sequel in the Hereafter namely
جَنَّاتُ عَدْنٍ يَدْخُلُونَهَا وَمَنْ صَلَحَ مِنْ آبَائِهِمْ وَأَزْوَاجِهِمْ وَذُرِّيَّاتِهِمْ وَالمَلاَئِكَةُ يَدْخُلُونَ عَلَيْهِمْ مِّن كُلِّ بَابٍ,Gardens of Eden as a place of residence which they shall enter they along with those who were righteous those who believed from among their fathers and their spouses and their descendants even if these latter did not perform deeds of the same merit as theirs they shall share with them their stations of Paradise as an honouring for them; and the angels shall enter to them from every gate of the gates of Paradise or of the gates of the palaces of Paradise when they first enter in order to congratulate them.
سَلاَمٌ عَلَيْكُم بِمَا صَبَرْتُمْ فَنِعْمَ عُقْبَىٰ ٱلدَّارِ,They will say to them ‘Peace be upon you this is the reward for your patience’ during life on earth. How excellent is your sequel the sequel of the heavenly Abode!
وَٱلَّذِينَ يَنقُضُونَ عَهْدَ ٱللَّهِ مِن بَعْدِ مِيثَاقِهِ وَيَقْطَعُونَ مَآ أَمَرَ ٱللَّهُ بِهِ أَن يُوصَلَ وَيُفْسِدُونَ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ لَهُمُ ٱللَّعْنَةُ وَلَهُمْ سُوۤءُ ٱلدَّارِ,And those who break God’s covenant after pledging it and sever what God has commanded should be cemented and work corruption in the earth through unbelief and acts of disobedience theirs shall be the curse banishment from God’s mercy and theirs shall be the awful abode the awful sequel in the abode of the Hereafter namely Hell.
ٱللَّهُ يَبْسُطُ ٱلرِّزْقَ لِمَنْ يَشَآءُ وَيَقَدِرُ وَفَرِحُواْ بِٱلْحَيَاةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَمَا ٱلْحَيَاةُ ٱلدُّنْيَا فِي ٱلآخِرَةِ إِلاَّ مَتَاعٌ,God expands provision He makes it abundant for whom He will and straitens restricts it for whomever He will; and they the people of Mecca rejoice a wanton rejoicing in the life of this world that is in what they acquire therein yet the life of this world in comparison with the life of the Hereafter is but a brief enjoyment a trifling thing enjoyed and then lost.
وَيَقُولُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لَوْلاَ أُنزِلَ عَلَيْهِ آيَةٌ مِّن رَّبِّهِ قُلْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُضِلُّ مَن يَشَآءُ وَيَهْدِيۤ إِلَيْهِ مَنْ أَنَابَ,And those who disbelieve from among the people of Mecca say ‘Why has not some sign like the staff and the glowing hand or the she-camel been sent down upon him upon Muhammad (s) from his Lord?’ Say to them ‘Indeed God sends astray whomever He will to send astray — such that signs cannot avail him in any way — and He guides He directs to Him to His religion those who turn in repentance’ those who return to Him man ‘those who’ is substituted by the following alladhīna ‘those who …’;
ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَتَطْمَئِنُّ قُلُوبُهُمْ بِذِكْرِ ٱللَّهِ أَلاَ بِذِكْرِ ٱللَّهِ تَطْمَئِنُّ ٱلْقُلُوبُ,those who believe and whose hearts are reassured find rest by God’s remembrance that is by His promise of reward. Verily by God’s remembrance are hearts reassured that is the hearts of the believers;
ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ طُوبَىٰ لَهُمْ وَحُسْنُ مَآبٍ,those who believe and perform righteous deeds alladhīna āmanū wa-‘amilū’l-sālihāt is the subject the predicate of which is the following theirs shall be blessedness tūbā is a verbal noun derived from tīb ‘goodness’ or the name of a tree in Paradise whose shade a mounted traveller travelling for 100 years would still not traverse and a fair resort a fair place to return to.
كَذَلِكَ أَرْسَلْنَاكَ فِيۤ أُمَّةٍ قَدْ خَلَتْ مِن قَبْلِهَآ أُمَمٌ لِّتَتْلُوَاْ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلَّذِيۤ أَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَيْكَ وَهُمْ يَكْفُرُونَ بِٱلرَّحْمَـٰنِ قُلْ هُوَ رَبِّي لاۤ إِلَـٰهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ عَلَيْهِ تَوَكَّلْتُ وَإِلَيْهِ مَتَابِ,Thus just as We sent prophets before you We have sent you to a community before whom other communities have passed away that you may recite to them that which We have revealed to you that is the Qur’ān; yet they disbelieve in the Compassionate One for when they were commanded to prostrate themselves to Him they said ‘And what is the Compassionate One?’ Say to them O Muhammad (s) ‘He is my Lord; there is no god save Him. In Him I trust and to Him is my recourse’.
وَلَوْ أَنَّ قُرْآناً سُيِّرَتْ بِهِ ٱلْجِبَالُ أَوْ قُطِّعَتْ بِهِ ٱلأَرْضُ أَوْ كُلِّمَ بِهِ ٱلْمَوْتَىٰ بَل للَّهِ ٱلأَمْرُ جَمِيعاً أَفَلَمْ يَيْأَسِ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُوۤاْ أَن لَّوْ يَشَآءُ ٱللَّهُ لَهَدَى ٱلنَّاسَ جَمِيعاً وَلاَ يَزَالُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ تُصِيبُهُم بِمَا صَنَعُواْ قَارِعَةٌ أَوْ تَحُلُّ قَرِيباً مِّن دَارِهِمْ حَتَّىٰ يَأْتِيَ وَعْدُ ٱللَّهِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لاَ يُخْلِفُ ٱلْمِيعَادَ,The following was revealed when they said to him ‘If you are truly a prophet then make these mountains of Mecca drift away before us and make for us rivers and springs in it that we may plant and sow seeds and resurrect for us our dead fathers to speak to us and tell us that you are a prophet’ Even if it were a Qur’ān whereby the mountains were set in motion moved from their places or the earth were cleft torn or the dead were spoken to such that they would respond they still would not believe. Nay but the affair belongs entirely to God and none other so that none believes except he whom He wills that he believes and no other; even if they were given what they request of signs. The following was revealed when the Companions were keen that what was requested of signs should be manifested hoping that they the ones requesting them might believe Have they not realised those who believe that an is softened in other words understand it as annahu had God willed He could have guided all mankind? to faith without the need for any sign? And the disbelievers from among the people of Mecca continue to be struck by devastation a catastrophe that devastates them through all manner of hardship such as being killed taken captive and suffering war or drought because of what they wrought because of their actions that is their disbelief; or you alight O Muhammad (s) together with your army near their home — Mecca — until God’s promise of victory against them comes to pass; truly God does not break His promise and indeed he alighted at Hudaybiyya until the conquest of Mecca took place;
وَلَقَدِ ٱسْتُهْزِئَ بِرُسُلٍ مِّن قَبْلِكَ فَأَمْلَيْتُ لِلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ ثُمَّ أَخَذْتُهُمْ فَكَيْفَ كَانَ عِقَابِ,messengers were certainly mocked before you in the same way that you have been mocked — this is meant as solace for the Prophet s — but I gave respite to those who disbelieved; then I seized them with retribution and how was My retribution? that is to say it My retribution will come to pass; and I shall deal with those who have mocked you in the same way.
أَفَمَنْ هُوَ قَآئِمٌ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ نَفْسٍ بِمَا كَسَبَتْ وَجَعَلُواْ لِلَّهِ شُرَكَآءَ قُلْ سَمُّوهُمْ أَمْ تُنَبِّئُونَهُ بِمَا لاَ يَعْلَمُ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ أَم بِظَاهِرٍ مِّنَ ٱلْقَوْلِ بَلْ زُيِّنَ لِلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مَكْرُهُمْ وَصُدُّواْ عَنِ ٱلسَّبِيلِ وَمَن يُضْلِلِ ٱللَّهُ فَمَا لَهُ مِنْ هَادٍ,Is He Who stands watches over every soul what it has earned? what it has done of good or evil — and this is God — like the idols who are not so? No! This response is suggested by the following words Yet they ascribe to God associates. Say ‘Name them! for Him who are they? Or will you inform Him will you inform God of something that is of an associate which He does not know in the earth? an interrogative of disavowal; in other words He has no associate for if He did He would know him — exalted be He above such a thing. Or is it — nay — you call them associates merely a manner of speaking?’ that is it is merely on the basis of false conjecture without any truth in it. Nay but their scheming their unbelief has been adorned for those who disbelieve and they have been barred from the way from the path of guidance; and whomever God sends astray for him there is no guide.
لَّهُمْ عَذَابٌ فِي ٱلْحَيَاةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَلَعَذَابُ ٱلآخِرَةِ أَشَقُّ وَمَا لَهُم مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ مِن وَاقٍ,For them there is chastisement in the life of this world through being killed or taken captive; and verily the chastisement of the Hereafter is more grievous is more severe; and they have no defender protector from God that is from His chastisement.
مَّثَلُ ٱلْجَنَّةِ ٱلَّتِي وُعِدَ ٱلْمُتَّقُونَ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلأَنْهَارُ أُكُلُهَا دَآئِمٌ وِظِلُّهَا تِلْكَ عُقْبَىٰ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱتَّقَواْ وَّعُقْبَى ٱلْكَافِرِينَ ٱلنَّارُ,The likeness the description of Paradise which has been promised to the God-fearing this is a subject the predicate of which has been omitted in other words according to what We recount to you is as follows beneath it rivers flow its food what is consumed in it is everlasting never perishing and its shade is everlasting never replaced by any sun because it does not exist therein. That namely Paradise is the reward the sequel of those who were wary of idolatry and the requital of the disbelievers is the Fire!
وَٱلَّذِينَ آتَيْنَاهُمُ ٱلْكِتَابَ يَفْرَحُونَ بِمَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ وَمِنَ ٱلأَحْزَابِ مَن يُنكِرُ بَعْضَهُ قُلْ إِنَّمَآ أُمِرْتُ أَنْ أَعْبُدَ ٱللَّهَ وَلاۤ أُشْرِكَ بِهِ إِلَيْهِ أَدْعُو وَإِلَيْهِ مَآبِ,And those to whom We have given the Scripture such as ‘Abd Allāh b. Salām and others from among the believing Jews rejoice in that which has been revealed to you because of its according with what they have with them of revelation; and among the factions that aligned themselves against you in enmity from among the idolaters and the Jews are those who reject some of it such as the mention of the ‘Compassionate One’ al-Rahmān and all that is other than the stories related therein. Say ‘I have been commanded — in that which has been revealed to me — only to worship God and not to associate anything with Him. To Him I call and to Him shall be my return’.
وَكَذٰلِكَ أَنزَلْنَاهُ حُكْماً عَرَبِيّاً وَلَئِنِ ٱتَّبَعْتَ أَهْوَاءَهُم بَعْدَ مَا جَآءَكَ مِنَ ٱلْعِلْمِ مَا لَكَ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ مِن وَلِيٍّ وَلاَ وَاقٍ,And so just like that manner of revelation We have revealed it that is the Qur’ān as a decisive judgement in Arabic in the language of the Arabs for you to judge thereby between people. And if you should follow their whims that is those of the disbelievers in that to which they summon you of their creed hypothetically speaking after what has come to you of knowledge of God’s Oneness you shall have no protector to assist you against God mina’Llāhi min the second min is extra and no defender to ward off His chastisement.
وَلَقَدْ أَرْسَلْنَا رُسُلاً مِّن قَبْلِكَ وَجَعَلْنَا لَهُمْ أَزْوَاجاً وَذُرِّيَّةً وَمَا كَانَ لِرَسُولٍ أَن يَأْتِيَ بِآيَةٍ إِلاَّ بِإِذْنِ ٱللَّهِ لِكُلِّ أَجَلٍ كِتَابٌ,And when they derided him for having many wives the following was revealed And indeed We sent messengers before you and We assigned to them wives and seed children — and you are like them; and it was not for any Messenger from among them that he should bring a sign save by God’s leave because they are servants enthralled by Him. For every term period there is a Book wherein is inscribed its delimitation.
يَمْحُواْ ٱللَّهُ مَا يَشَآءُ وَيُثْبِتُ وَعِندَهُ أُمُّ ٱلْكِتَابِ,God effaces of it the Book whatever He will and He fixes read yuthbit or yuthabbit therein whatever He will of rulings or other matters and with Him is the Mother of the Book its source of origin of which nothing is ever changed and which consists of what He inscribed in pre-eternity azal.
وَإِن مَّا نُرِيَنَّكَ بَعْضَ ٱلَّذِي نَعِدُهُمْ أَوْ نَتَوَفَّيَنَّكَ فَإِنَّمَا عَلَيْكَ ٱلْبَلاَغُ وَعَلَيْنَا ٱلْحِسَابُ,And whether read as immā the nūn of the conditional particle in ‘whether’ has been assimiliated with the extra mā We show you a part of that which We promise them of chastisement during your lifetime the response of the conditional statement has been omitted in other words understand it as being fa-dhāk ‘then so shall it be’; or We take you to Us before chastising them; it is for you only to convey the Message your duty is only to deliver the Message and it is for Us to do the reckoning when they finally come to Us whereupon We shall requite them.
أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْاْ أَنَّا نَأْتِي ٱلأَرْضَ نَنقُصُهَا مِنْ أَطْرَافِهَا وَٱللَّهُ يَحْكُمُ لاَ مُعَقِّبَ لِحُكْمِهِ وَهُوَ سَرِيعُ ٱلْحِسَابِ,Or is it that they the people of Mecca have not seen how We visit the land how We target their land diminishing it at its outlying regions? by giving victory to the Prophet s. And God judges among His creatures as He will; there is none that can repel His judgement and He is swift at reckoning.
وَقَدْ مَكَرَ ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ فَلِلَّهِ ٱلْمَكْرُ جَمِيعاً يَعْلَمُ مَا تَكْسِبُ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ وَسَيَعْلَمُ ٱلْكُفَّارُ لِمَنْ عُقْبَى ٱلدَّارِ,And indeed those that were before them of communities plotted against their prophets just as they plot against you; but to God belongs all plotting. And nor is their plotting like the plotting of God for exalted be He He knows what every soul earns and so its requital is prepared for it and this is the ultimate plotting since He brings it to them whence they are not aware. The disbeliever the genus is meant here; a variant reading has kuffār ‘the disbelievers’ shall assuredly know for whom shall be the sequel of the heavenly Abode that is the praiseworthy sequel in the abode of the Hereafter will it be theirs or that of the Prophet s and his Companions?
وَيَقُولُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لَسْتَ مُرْسَلاً قُلْ كَفَىٰ بِٱللَّهِ شَهِيداً بَيْنِي وَبَيْنَكُمْ وَمَنْ عِندَهُ عِلْمُ ٱلْكِتَابِ,And those who disbelieve say to you ‘You have not been sent by God!’ Say to them ‘God suffices as a witness between me and you to my truthfulness as a messenger and he who possesses knowledge of the Book’ from among the Christian and Jewish believers.
الۤر كِتَابٌ أَنزَلْنَاهُ إِلَيْكَ لِتُخْرِجَ ٱلنَّاسَ مِنَ ٱلظُّلُمَاتِ إِلَى ٱلنُّورِ بِإِذْنِ رَبِّهِمْ إِلَىٰ صِرَاطِ ٱلْعَزِيزِ ٱلْحَمِيدِ,Alif lām rā’ God knows best what He means by these letters. This Qur’ān is a Book We have revealed to you O Muhammad (s) that you may bring forth mankind from darkness from unbelief into light into faith by the leave by the command of their Lord ilā’l-nūr ‘into light’ may be substituted by the following ilā sirāt to the path the way of the Mighty the Victor the Praised the One who is constantly praised.
ٱللَّهِ ٱلَّذِي لَهُ مَا فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَوَيْلٌ لِّلْكَافِرِينَ مِنْ عَذَابٍ شَدِيدٍ,God Allāhi read in the genitive as a substitution or an explicative supplement with what follows being an adjectival qualification; or read as Allāhu in the nominative as a subject the predicate of which is what follows to Whom belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth as possessions creatures and servants. And woe to the disbelievers from a terrible chastisement
ٱلَّذِينَ يَسْتَحِبُّونَ ٱلْحَيَاةَ ٱلدُّنْيَا عَلَى ٱلآخِرَةِ وَيَصُدُّونَ عَن سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ وَيَبْغُونَهَا عِوَجاً أُوْلَـٰئِكَ فِي ضَلاَلٍ بَعِيدٍ,those who alladhīna is a description prefer choose the life of this world over the Hereafter and bar people from God’s way from the religion of Islam and seek to make it that is the path crooked — those they are far astray from the truth.
وَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن رَّسُولٍ إِلاَّ بِلِسَانِ قَوْمِهِ لِيُبَيِّنَ لَهُمْ فَيُضِلُّ ٱللَّهُ مَن يَشَآءُ وَيَهْدِي مَن يَشَآءُ وَهُوَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ,And We have not sent any Messenger except with the tongue with the language of his people that he might make the Message clear to them that he might make them understand what he brings to them; God then sends astray whomever He will and He guides whomever He will; and He is the Mighty in His kingdom the Wise in His actions.
وَلَقَدْ أَرْسَلْنَا مُوسَىٰ بِآيَاتِنَآ أَنْ أَخْرِجْ قَوْمَكَ مِنَ ٱلظُّلُمَاتِ إِلَى ٱلنُّورِ وَذَكِّرْهُمْ بِأَيَّامِ ٱللَّهِ إِنَّ فِي ذٰلِكَ لآيَاتٍ لِّكُلِّ صَبَّارٍ شَكُورٍ,And verily We sent Moses with Our signs the nine signs and We said to him ‘Bring forth your people the Children of Israel out of darkness out of unbelief into light into faith and remind them of the Days of God’ of His graces. Surely in that reminder are signs for every man enduring in obedience to God thankful for His graces.
وَإِذْ قَالَ مُوسَىٰ لِقَوْمِهِ ٱذْكُرُواْ نِعْمَةَ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ إِذْ أَنجَاكُمْ مِّنْ آلِ فِرْعَوْنَ يَسُومُونَكُمْ سُوۤءَ ٱلْعَذَابِ وَيُذَبِّحُونَ أَبْنَآءَكُمْ وَيَسْتَحْيُونَ نِسَآءَكُمْ وَفِي ذٰلِكُمْ بَلاۤءٌ مِّن رَّبَّكُمْ عَظِيمٌ,And mention when Moses said to his people ‘Remember God’s grace to you when He delivered you from the folk of Pharaoh who were inflicting upon you a dreadful chastisement and were slaughtering your sons the new-born and sparing keeping alive your women — this was because some of the priests of Egypt had stated that a child born among the Israelites shall be the cause of the destruction of Pharaoh’s kingdom; and in that deliverance — or in that chastisement — was a tremendous trial grace — or a tremendous test — from your Lord.
وَإِذْ تَأَذَّنَ رَبُّكُمْ لَئِن شَكَرْتُمْ لأَزِيدَنَّكُمْ وَلَئِن كَفَرْتُمْ إِنَّ عَذَابِي لَشَدِيدٌ,And when your Lord proclaimed when He made it known that “If you are thankful for My graces through affirmation of My Oneness and obedience to Me then assuredly I shall give you more; but if you are thankless if you deny the truth of the grace through disbelief and disobedience then assuredly I shall chastise you — as is indicated by His following words — My chastisement is indeed severe” ’.
وَقَالَ مُوسَىۤ إِن تَكْفُرُوۤاْ أَنتُمْ وَمَن فِي ٱلأَرْضِ جَمِيعاً فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَغَنِيٌّ حَمِيدٌ,And Moses said to his people ‘If you are thankless you and all who are on earth lo! assuredly God is Independent without need of His creatures Praised’ praiseworthy in what He does with them.
أَلَمْ يَأْتِكُمْ نَبَأُ ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ قَوْمِ نُوحٍ وَعَادٍ وَثَمُودَ وَٱلَّذِينَ مِن بَعْدِهِمْ لاَ يَعْلَمُهُمْ إِلاَّ ٱللَّهُ جَآءَتْهُمْ رُسُلُهُمْ بِٱلْبَيِّنَـٰتِ فَرَدُّوۤاْ أَيْدِيَهُمْ فِيۤ أَفْوَٰهِهِمْ وَقَالُوۤاْ إِنَّا كَفَرْنَا بِمَآ أُرْسِلْتُمْ بِهِ وَإِنَّا لَفِي شَكٍّ مِّمَّا تَدْعُونَنَآ إِلَيْهِ مُرِيبٍ,Has there not come to you an interrogative meant as an affirmative the tidings the news of those who were before you — the people of Noah and ‘Ād — the people of Hūd — and Thamūd — the people of Sālih — and those after them? None knows them save God. This is on account of their multitude. Their messengers brought them clear signs with lucid arguments demonstrating their truthfulness; but they that is the communities thrust their hands into their mouths to bite on them out of extreme spite and said ‘Lo! we disbelieve in that wherewith you have been sent according to what you claim and lo! we are in grave doubt concerning that to which you call us’ doubt creating great uncertainty.
قَالَتْ رُسُلُهُمْ أَفِي ٱللَّهِ شَكٌّ فَاطِرِ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ يَدْعُوكُمْ لِيَغْفِرَ لَكُمْ مِّن ذُنُوبِكُمْ وَيُؤَخِّرَكُمْ إِلَىۤ أَجَلٍ مُّسَـمًّـى قَالُوۤاْ إِنْ أَنتُمْ إِلاَّ بَشَرٌ مِّثْلُنَا تُرِيدُونَ أَن تَصُدُّونَا عَمَّا كَانَ يَعْبُدُ آبَآؤُنَا فَأْتُونَا بِسُلْطَانٍ مُّبِينٍ,Their messengers said ‘Can there be doubt concerning God an interrogative meant as a denial in other words there can be no doubt concerning His Oneness given the manifest proofs of it the Originator the Creator of the heavens and the earth? He calls you to obedience of Him so that He might forgive you your sins min dhunūbikum min is extra since through submission to the One God all that may have been committed previously is forgiven or else it min ‘some of’ is partitive intended to state that forgiveness which is due to God’s servants and defer you without chastisement to an appointed term’ the term of death. They said ‘You are but mortals like us desiring to bar us from that which our fathers used to worship in the way of idols. So bring us a clear warrant’ a manifest argument demonstrating your truthfulness.
قَالَتْ لَهُمْ رُسُلُهُمْ إِن نَّحْنُ إِلاَّ بَشَرٌ مِّثْلُكُمْ وَلَـٰكِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَمُنُّ عَلَىٰ مَن يَشَآءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ وَمَا كَانَ لَنَآ أَن نَّأْتِيَكُمْ بِسُلْطَانٍ إِلاَّ بِإِذْنِ ٱللَّهِ وَعلَى ٱللَّهِ فَلْيَتَوَكَّلِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ,Their messengers said to them ‘We are but mortals like you as you have said; but God is gracious to whomever He will of His servants by way of assigning prophethood. And it is not ours to bring you any warrant save by the leave of God by His command for we are servants enthralled; and in God let believers put their trust let them have confidence in Him.
وَمَا لَنَآ أَلاَّ نَتَوَكَّلَ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ وَقَدْ هَدَانَا سُبُلَنَا وَلَنَصْبِرَنَّ عَلَىٰ مَآ آذَيْتُمُونَا وَعَلَى ٱللَّهِ فَلْيَتَوَكَّلِ ٱلْمُتَوَكِّلُونَ,And why indeed should we not put our trust in God in other words there is nothing to prevent us from doing this when He has guided us our ways? And we shall surely endure the hurt you do us. And in God let the trusting put their trust’.
وَقَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لِرُسُلِهِمْ لَنُخْرِجَنَّـكُمْ مِّنْ أَرْضِنَآ أَوْ لَتَعُودُنَّ فِي مِلَّتِنَا فَأَوْحَىٰ إِلَيْهِمْ رَبُّهُمْ لَنُهْلِكَنَّ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ,And those who disbelieved said to their messengers ‘We will assuredly expel you from our land or you will surely return you will surely end up returning to our creed’ our religion. Then their Lord inspired them saying ‘We shall surely destroy the evildoers the disbelievers
وَلَنُسْكِنَنَّـكُمُ ٱلأَرْضَ مِن بَعْدِهِمْ ذٰلِكَ لِمَنْ خَافَ مَقَامِي وَخَافَ وَعِيدِ,and We shall surely make you dwell in the land their land after them after they have been destroyed — that victory over them and bequest of the land to you is for whoever fears the standing before Me that is whoever fears when he comes to stand before Me and fears My threat’ of chastisement.
وَٱسْتَفْتَحُواْ وَخَابَ كُلُّ جَبَّارٍ عَنِيدٍ,And they sought victory the messengers sought assistance from God against their people; and every tyrant disdaining obedience to God rebellious obstinate to the truth was brought to nothing;
مِّن وَرَآئِهِ جَهَنَّمُ وَيُسْقَىٰ مِن مَّآءٍ صَدِيدٍ,beyond him that is in front of him is Hell which he will enter and he is given to drink in it of festering fluid — which is what issues out of the insides of the people of the Fire mixed with pus and blood —
يَتَجَرَّعُهُ وَلاَ يَكَادُ يُسِيغُهُ وَيَأْتِيهِ ٱلْمَوْتُ مِن كُلِّ مَكَانٍ وَمَا هُوَ بِمَيِّتٍ وَمِن وَرَآئِهِ عَذَابٌ غَلِيظٌ,which he sips gulping it repeatedly because of its acridity but can scarcely swallow scarcely ingest because it is so foul and disgusting; and death that is those causes of it that necessarily bring it about in the way of different types of chastisement comes to him from every side yet he cannot die; and still beyond him after that chastisement there is a harsh chastisement a severe one following on from the previous one.
مَّثَلُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ بِرَبِّهِمْ أَعْمَالُهُمْ كَرَمَادٍ ٱشْتَدَّتْ بِهِ ٱلرِّيحُ فِي يَوْمٍ عَاصِفٍ لاَّ يَقْدِرُونَ مِمَّا كَسَبُواْ عَلَىٰ شَيْءٍ ذٰلِكَ هُوَ ٱلضَّلاَلُ ٱلْبَعِيدُ,The likeness the description of those who disbelieve in their Lord alladhīna kafarū bi-rabbihim the subject substituted by the following a‘māluhum their works the righteous ones such as kindness to kin or an act of charity — in the way that no benefit can be derived from them it is because these works — are as ashes over which the wind blows hard on a tempestuous day one in which the winds blow violently making them as scattered dust over which none can have power the genitive clause beginning with ka-ramādin ‘as ashes’ constitutes the predicate of the above-mentioned subject; they that is the disbelievers have no power over anything that they have earned anything that they had done in their life on earth in other words they shall find no reward for it since this was never a precondition. That is extreme error extreme perdition!
أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ خَلَقَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضَ بِٱلْحقِّ إِن يَشَأْ يُذْهِبْكُمْ وَيَأْتِ بِخَلْقٍ جَدِيدٍ,Have you not seen have you not observed O you being addressed this is an interrogative meant as an affirmative that God created the heavens and the earth in truth? bi’l-haqq is semantically connected to the action of the verb khalaqa ‘created’. If He will He can take you away O mankind and bring about a new creation in your place.
وَمَا ذٰلِكَ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ بِعَزِيزٍ,And that for God is surely no great no difficult matter.
وَبَرَزُواْ لِلَّهِ جَمِيعاً فَقَالَ ٱلضُّعَفَاءُ لِلَّذِينَ ٱسْتَكْبَرُوۤاْ إِنَّا كُنَّا لَكُمْ تَبَعًا فَهَلْ أَنتُمْ مُّغْنُونَ عَنَّا مِنْ عَذَابِ ٱللَّهِ مِن شَيْءٍ قَالُواْ لَوْ هَدَانَا ٱللَّهُ لَهَدَيْنَاكُمْ سَوَآءٌ عَلَيْنَآ أَجَزِعْنَآ أَمْ صَبَرْنَا مَا لَنَا مِن مَّحِيصٍ,And they that is all creatures sally forth to God wa-barazū this and what follows is expressed in the past tense because it will come to pass all together; then the weak the followers say to those who were arrogant those who were followed ‘Indeed we were your followers taba‘an is the plural of tābi‘. Will you then avail defend us against the chastisement of God in any way?’ min ‘adhābi’Llāhi min shay’in the first min is explicative while the second one is partitive. They the ones followed say ‘If God had guided us we would have guided you we would have called you to right guidance. It is the same for us whether we rage impatiently or patiently endure; we do not have any asylum’ any refuge min mahīs ‘any asylum’ min is extra.
وَقَالَ ٱلشَّيْطَانُ لَمَّا قُضِيَ ٱلأَمْرُ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ وَعَدَكُمْ وَعْدَ ٱلْحَقِّ وَوَعَدتُّكُمْ فَأَخْلَفْتُكُمْ وَمَا كَانَ لِيَ عَلَيْكُمْ مِّن سُلْطَانٍ إِلاَّ أَن دَعَوْتُكُمْ فَٱسْتَجَبْتُمْ لِي فَلاَ تَلُومُونِي وَلُومُوۤاْ أَنفُسَكُمْ مَّآ أَنَاْ بِمُصْرِخِكُمْ وَمَآ أَنتُمْ بِمُصْرِخِيَّ إِنِّي كَفَرْتُ بِمَآ أَشْرَكْتُمُونِ مِن قَبْلُ إِنَّ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,And Satan Iblīs says when the issue has been decided and the people of Paradise are in Paradise and those of the Fire are in the Fire and they the people of the Fire have gathered round him ‘Truly God promised you a promise of truth regarding resurrection and requital fulfilling it to you; whereas I promised you that this would not be then failed you for over you I had no warrant min sultān min is extra no power or capacity to compel you to follow me except that I called you and you responded to me. So do not blame me but blame yourselves for having responded to me. I cannot heed your distress call I cannot bring aid to you nor can you heed mine read bi-musrikhiyya or bi-musrikhī. Lo! I disbelieved in your making me an associate of God formerly’ during life on earth. God exalted be He says Truly for the evildoers the disbelievers there shall be a painful chastisement.
وَأُدْخِلَ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلأَنْهَارُ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا بِإِذْنِ رَبِّهِمْ تَحِيَّتُهُمْ فِيهَا سَلاَمٌ,And those who believed and performed righteous deeds they are admitted to gardens underneath which rivers flow abiding khālidīna is a circumstantial qualifier of an implied situation therein by the leave of their Lord their greeting therein from God and from the angels and between themselves ‘Peace!’.
أَلَمْ تَرَ كَيْفَ ضَرَبَ ٱللَّهُ مَثَلاً كَلِمَةً طَيِّبَةً كَشَجَرةٍ طَيِّبَةٍ أَصْلُهَا ثَابِتٌ وَفَرْعُهَا فِي ٱلسَّمَآءِ,Have you not seen observed how God has struck a similitude? mathalan is substituted by the following words kalimatan tayyibatan a goodly saying which is ‘there is no god but God’ is as a goodly tree a palm tree its root set firm in the ground and its shoots its branches are in heaven;
تُؤْتِيۤ أُكُلَهَا كُلَّ حِينٍ بِإِذْنِ رَبِّهَا وَيَضْرِبُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلأَمْثَالَ لِلنَّاسِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَذَكَّرُونَ,it gives its produce its fruit every season by the leave of its Lord by His will. Similarly the words of faith are set firm in the heart of the believer; his works are raised up to heaven and he receives the blessings and reward therefrom all the time. And God strikes He makes clear similitudes for mankind so that they might remember be admonished and therefore believe.
وَمَثلُ كَلِمَةٍ خَبِيثَةٍ كَشَجَرَةٍ خَبِيثَةٍ ٱجْتُثَّتْ مِن فَوْقِ ٱلأَرْضِ مَا لَهَا مِن قَرَارٍ,And the similitude of a bad saying that is the word of unbelief is as a bad tree a colocynth uprooted from upon the earth having no stability no fixing or foundation. Similarly the word of unbelief has no foundation and no shoot or blessing.
يُثَبِّتُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ بِٱلْقَوْلِ ٱلثَّابِتِ فِي ٱلْحَيَاةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَفِي ٱلآخِرَةِ وَيُضِلُّ ٱللَّهُ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ وَيَفْعَلُ ٱللَّهُ مَا يَشَآءُ,God confirms those who believe by a firm saying namely the profession of His Oneness in the life of this world and in the Hereafter that is in the grave when the two angels question them about their Lord their religion and their Prophet and they respond correctly as reported in the hadīth of the two Shaykhs al-Bukhārī and Muslim; and God sends astray the evildoers the disbelievers and therefore they are not guided to the correct response saying instead ‘We do not know’ as reported in the hadīth; and God does what He will.
أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى ٱلَّذِينَ بَدَّلُواْ نِعْمَتَ ٱللَّهِ كُفْراً وَأَحَلُّواْ قَوْمَهُمْ دَارَ ٱلْبَوَارِ,Have you not seen observed those who exchanged God’s grace that is the thanks due for it for unthankfulness — these were the disbelievers of Quraysh — and who by leading them astray caused their people to take up residence in the Abode of Ruin?
جَهَنَّمَ يَصْلَوْنَهَا وَبِئْسَ ٱلْقَرَارُ,Hell jahannama a supplement functioning as an explicative to which they shall be exposed admitted — an evil place to settle!
وَجَعَلُواْ لِلَّهِ أَندَاداً لِّيُضِلُّواْ عَن سَبِيلِهِ قُلْ تَمَتَّعُواْ فَإِنَّ مَصِيرَكُمْ إِلَى ٱلنَّارِ,And they have set up rivals to associates with God that they might lead others astray read li-yadillū or li-yudillū from His way the religion of Islam. Say to them ‘Enjoy! this world of yours for a short time. For lo! your journey’s end your return shall be to the Fire!’.
قُل لِّعِبَادِيَ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ يُقِيمُواْ ٱلصَّلاَةَ وَيُنْفِقُواْ مِمَّا رَزَقْنَاهُمْ سِرّاً وَعَلانِيَةً مِّن قَبْلِ أَن يَأْتِيَ يَوْمٌ لاَّ بَيْعٌ فِيهِ وَلاَ خِلاَلٌ,Tell My servants who believe that they establish prayers and expend of that which We have provided them secretly and openly before a day comes wherein there will be neither bargaining ransoming nor befriending that is when there will not be any friendship of any benefit this is the Day of Resurrection.
ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِي خَلَقَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضَ وَأَنزَلَ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مَآءً فَأَخْرَجَ بِهِ مِنَ ٱلثَّمَرَاتِ رِزْقاً لَّكُمْ وَسَخَّرَ لَكُمُ ٱلْفُلْكَ لِتَجْرِيَ فِي ٱلْبَحْرِ بِأَمْرِهِ وَسَخَّرَ لَكُمُ ٱلأَنْهَارَ,God it is Who created the heavens and the earth and He sends down water from the heaven and with it He brings forth fruits as sustenance for you. And He has disposed for you the ships that they may run upon the sea laden with passengers and cargo at His commandment by His leave and He has disposed for you the rivers.
وَسَخَّر لَكُمُ ٱلشَّمْسَ وَٱلْقَمَرَ دَآئِبَينَ وَسَخَّرَ لَكُمُ ٱلَّيلَ وَٱلنَّهَارَ,And He has disposed for you the sun and the moon constant moving in their courses without pause; and He has disposed for you the night that you may rest therein and the day that you may seek of His bounty therein.
وَآتَاكُم مِّن كُلِّ مَا سَأَلْتُمُوهُ وَإِن تَعُدُّواْ نِعْمَتَ ٱللَّهِ لاَ تُحْصُوهَا إِنَّ ٱلإنْسَانَ لَظَلُومٌ كَفَّارٌ,And He gives you of all that you ask of Him according to your individual best interests. And if you were to enumerate God’s graces meaning His bestowal of graces you could never number it you would not be able to count it. Lo! man the disbelieving man is verily a wrong-doer and unthankful! ever wronging his own soul through acts of disobedience and ungratefulness towards God’s grace.
وَإِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ رَبِّ ٱجْعَلْ هَـٰذَا ٱلْبَلَدَ ءَامِناً وَٱجْنُبْنِي وَبَنِيَّ أَن نَّعْبُدَ ٱلأَصْنَامَ,And mention when Abraham said ‘My Lord make this land Mecca secure — God granted him this petition and thus made it Mecca a sanctuary in which no human blood is shed no person is wronged prey is not hunted and one which is never deserted in any of its parts — and turn me and my sons away from serving idols.
رَبِّ إِنَّهُنَّ أَضْلَلْنَ كَثِيراً مِّنَ ٱلنَّاسِ فَمَن تَبِعَنِي فَإِنَّهُ مِنِّي وَمَنْ عَصَانِي فَإِنَّكَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,My Lord truly they idols have led many of mankind astray because of their mankind’s worship of them. So whoever follows me believing in the Oneness of God verily belongs with me belongs with those who follow my religion; and whoever disobeys me truly You are Forgiving Merciful this was before he was aware of the fact that God does not forgive idolatry.
رَّبَّنَآ إِنَّيۤ أَسْكَنتُ مِن ذُرِّيَّتِي بِوَادٍ غَيْرِ ذِي زَرْعٍ عِندَ بَيْتِكَ ٱلْمُحَرَّمِ رَبَّنَا لِيُقِيمُواْ ٱلصَّلاَةَ فَٱجْعَلْ أَفْئِدَةً مِّنَ ٱلنَّاسِ تَهْوِىۤ إِلَيْهِمْ وَٱرْزُقْهُمْ مِّنَ ٱلثَّمَرَاتِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَشْكُرُونَ,Our Lord indeed I have made some of my seed that is Ishmael and his mother Hagar to dwell in a valley where there is no sown land namely Mecca by Your Sacred House which had been there since before the Flood our Lord that they may establish prayer. So make some of the hearts of men yearn incline and long towards them — Ibn ‘Abbās said ‘Had He said “Make all the hearts of men …” assuredly the Persians the Byzantines and all of mankind would have yearned towards them’. And provide them with fruits that they might be thankful and this petition was granted for the town of al-Tā’if was transferred to that land.
رَبَّنَآ إِنَّكَ تَعْلَمُ مَا نُخْفِي وَمَا نُعْلِنُ وَمَا يَخْفَىٰ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ مِن شَيْءٍ فَي ٱلأَرْضِ وَلاَ فِي ٱلسَّمَآءِ,Our Lord You know what we hide keep secret and what we proclaim. And nothing min shay’in min is extra is hidden from God in the earth or in the heaven these may constitute God’s words or the words of Abraham.
ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ ٱلَّذِي وَهَبَ لِي عَلَى ٱلْكِبَرِ إِسْمَاعِيلَ وَإِسْحَاقَ إِنَّ رَبِّي لَسَمِيعُ ٱلدُّعَآءِ,Praise be to God Who has given me despite my old age Ishmael — born to him when he Abraham was 99 years old — and Isaac — born to him when he was 112 years old.

Our Lord! And accept my supplication the supplication mentioned.
رَبَّنَا ٱغْفِرْ لِي وَلِوَالِدَيَّ وَلِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ يَوْمَ يَقُومُ ٱلْحِسَابُ,Our Lord forgive me and my parents — this was before their enmity towards God Mighty and Majestic became clear; but it is also said that his mother submitted to God the alternative reading here being the singular wālidī ‘my father’; or yet another variant reading being waladī ‘my son’ and forgive believers on the day when the reckoning shall come to pass’ the day it shall be effected. God exalted be He says
وَلاَ تَحْسَبَنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَافِلاً عَمَّا يَعْمَلُ ٱلظَّالِمُونَ إِنَّمَا يُؤَخِّرُهُمْ لِيَوْمٍ تَشْخَصُ فِيهِ ٱلأَبْصَارُ,And do not suppose that God is heedless of what the evildoers the disbelievers from among the people of Mecca do. He but gives them respite without chastisement until a day when eyes shall stare wide-open because of the terror of what they see one says shakhasa basaru fulān to mean ‘he opened them his eyes and did not shut them’;
مُهْطِعِينَ مُقْنِعِي رُءُوسِهِمْ لاَ يَرْتَدُّ إِلَيْهِمْ طَرْفُهُمْ وَأَفْئِدَتُهُمْ هَوَآءٌ,as they come hastening muhti‘īna is a circumstantial qualifier with their heads turned upwards to the heaven their gaze their sight returning not to them and their hearts as air devoid of any sense because of their being terror-stricken.
وَأَنذِرِ ٱلنَّاسَ يَوْمَ يَأْتِيهِمُ ٱلْعَذَابُ فَيَقُولُ ٱلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوۤاْ رَبَّنَآ أَخِّرْنَآ إِلَىٰ أَجَلٍ قَرِيبٍ نُّجِبْ دَعْوَتَكَ وَنَتَّبِعِ ٱلرُّسُلَ أَوَلَمْ تَكُونُوۤاْ أَقْسَمْتُمْ مِّن قَبْلُ مَا لَكُمْ مِّن زَوَالٍ,And warn make them have fear O Muhammad (s) mankind the disbelievers of the day when chastisement will come upon them namely the Day of Resurrection and those who did evil who disbelieved will say ‘Our Lord give us respite by returning us to the world for a brief while that we might respond to Your call by affirming Your Oneness and follow the messengers’. It is then said to them in rebuke ‘But did you not use to swear formerly in the world that for you there would be no passing away? min zawālin min is extra from this world to the Hereafter?
وَسَكَنتُمْ فِي مَسَـٰكِنِ ٱلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوۤاْ أَنفُسَهُمْ وَتَبَيَّنَ لَكُمْ كَيْفَ فَعَلْنَا بِهِمْ وَضَرَبْنَا لَكُمُ ٱلأَمْثَالَ,And you dwelt in it in the dwelling-places of those who wronged themselves through unbelief those from among communities of old and it became clear to you how We dealt with them by way of punishment — but you were not restrained thereby — and We struck made clear similitudes for you in the Qur’ān but you did not take heed.
وَقَدْ مَكَرُواْ مَكْرَهُمْ وَعِندَ ٱللَّهِ مَكْرُهُمْ وَإِن كَانَ مَكْرُهُمْ لِتَزُولَ مِنْهُ ٱلْجِبَالُ,And verily they plotted against the Prophet s their plot — when they desired to kill him or detain him in his house or banish him — but their plotting is with God that is to say knowledge or the requital thereof is with God and their plotting even though it be great was not such whereby mountains should be moved meaning that it is not of any importance but that they are only harming themselves thereby. It is said that the use of ‘mountains’ here is meant to be literal; alternatively it is also said to be a reference to the laws of Islam which are likened to these mountains in the way that they are established and fixed a variant reading has la-tazūlu instead of li-tazūla with in softened from inna ‘verily’ in which case the intended meaning is that the extent of their plotting is great. It is said that ‘plotting’ here is actually a reference to their unbelief. This second reading is consonant with God’s saying Whereby the heavens are almost torn and the earth split asunder and the mountains fall crashing Q. 1990; according to the former reading however one should read it as if it were wa-mā kāna and their plotting was not such ….
فَلاَ تَحْسَبَنَّ ٱللَّهَ مُخْلِفَ وَعْدِهِ رُسُلَهُ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ ذُو ٱنْتِقَامٍ,So do not suppose that God will fail to keep His promise of victory to His messengers. Truly God is Mighty Victor nothing able to escape Him Lord of Retribution against those who disobey Him.

Muslim relates the following hadīth ‘The Prophet s was asked “Where will people be on that day?” He said “On the Bridge sirāt” ’; and they shall come forth they shall exit from their graves to God the One the Almighty.
وَتَرَى ٱلْمُجْرِمِينَ يَوْمَئِذٍ مُّقَرَّنِينَ فِي ٱلأَصْفَادِ,And you shall see O Muhammad (s) the sinners the disbelievers on that day coupled chained together with their individual devils in chains manacles or collars

لِيَجْزِىَ ٱللَّهُ كُلَّ نَفْسٍ مَّا كَسَبَتْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ سَرِيعُ ٱلْحِسَابِ,that God may requite li-yajziya is semantically connected to the verb barazū ‘they shall come forth’ every soul for what it has earned of good and evil. Truly God is swift at reckoning — He shall reckon with all creatures in about half a day of the days of this world as one hadīth states to that effect.
هَـٰذَا بَلاَغٌ لِّلنَّاسِ وَلِيُنذَرُواْ بِهِ وَلِيَعْلَمُوۤاْ أَنَّمَا هُوَ إِلَـٰهٌ وَاحِدٌ وَلِيَذَّكَّرَ أُوْلُواْ ٱلأَلْبَابِ,This Qur’ān is a Proclamation for mankind in other words it was revealed in order to proclaim to them and so that they may be warned thereby and that they may know by way of the arguments contained in it that He namely God is One God and that people of pith possessors of intellect may remember yadhdhakkara the original tā’ of yatadhakkara has been assimilated with the dhāl that they may be admonished.

كَذَلِكَ نَسْلُكُهُ فِي قُلُوبِ ٱلْمُجْرِمِينَ,Thus We cause it to find its way in other words in the same way that We have caused denial to enter the hearts of those individuals We cause it to enter into the hearts of the sinners that is the disbelievers of Mecca.

وَعَلَىٰ ٱللَّهِ قَصْدُ ٱلسَّبِيلِ وَمِنْهَا جَآئِرٌ وَلَوْ شَآءَ لَهَدَاكُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ,And God’s is the direction of the way that is to point out the straight path and some of them that is the paths are deviant swerving away from straightness.

وَإِن تَعُدُّواْ نِعْمَةَ ٱللَّهِ لاَ تُحْصُوهَآ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَغَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,And if you were to count God’s grace you could never reckon it number it precisely let alone be able to give thanks for it.

وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمْ مَّاذَآ أَنْزَلَ رَبُّكُمْ قَالُواْ أَسَاطِيرُ ٱلأَوَّلِينَ,The following was revealed regarding al-Nadr b. al-Hārith And when it is said to them ‘What is it mā is an interrogative particle; dhā is a relative particle that your Lord has revealed?’ to Muhammad (s) they say that these revelations are ‘fables lies of the ancients’ in order to lead people astray.
لِيَحْمِلُواْ أَوْزَارَهُمْ كَامِلَةً يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ وَمِنْ أَوْزَارِ ٱلَّذِينَ يُضِلُّونَهُمْ بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ أَلاَ سَآءَ مَا يَزِرُونَ,That they may bear at the conclusion of the matter their burdens their sins complete none of them expunged on the Day of Resurrection and also bear some of the burdens of those whom they lead astray without any knowledge because they summoned them to error and they the latter followed them and thus both share in the sin.

قَدْ مَكَرَ ٱلَّذِينَ مِنْ قَبْلِهِمْ فَأَتَى ٱللَّهُ بُنْيَانَهُمْ مِّنَ ٱلْقَوَاعِدِ فَخَرَّ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلسَّقْفُ مِن فَوْقِهِمْ وَأَتَاهُمُ ٱلْعَذَابُ مِنْ حَيْثُ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ,Those before them had indeed plotted those such as Nimrod — he built a lofty tower that he might ascend through it to the heavens and wage war against its inhabitants; then God came at He aimed at their edifice from the foundations from the base unleashing against it winds and earthquake which demolished it; and so the roof collapsed upon them from above them that is while they were beneath it and the chastisement came upon them whence they were not aware from a direction which would not have occurred to them alternatively it is said that this description is a simile for demonstrating the thwarting of that which they had settled on in the way of plots against God’s messengers.
ثُمَّ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ يُخْزِيهِمْ وَيَقُولُ أَيْنَ شُرَكَآئِيَ ٱلَّذِينَ كُنْتُمْ تُشَاقُّونَ فِيهِمْ قَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ ٱلْعِلْمَ إِنَّ ٱلْخِزْيَ ٱلْيَوْمَ وَٱلْسُّوۤءَ عَلَى ٱلْكَافِرِينَ,Then on the Day of Resurrection He will disgrace them humiliate them and He God will say to them by the tongues of the angels in rebuke ‘Where are those associates of Mine as you were wont to claim concerning whom for whose sake you used to make breaches?’ you used to opposed the believers. Those who were given knowledge from among the prophets and believers will say ‘Truly disgrace on this day as well as misfortune are for the disbelievers — they say this rejoicing at their the disbelievers’ misfortune —
ٱلَّذِينَ تَتَوَفَّاهُمُ ٱلْمَلائِكَةُ ظَالِمِي أَنْفُسِهِمْ فَأَلْقَوُاْ ٱلسَّلَمَ مَا كُنَّا نَعْمَلُ مِن سُوۤءٍ بَلَىٰ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلِيمٌ بِمَا كُنْتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ,those whom the angels take in death read feminine person tatawaffāhum or masculine yatawaffāhum while they are wronging themselves’ through disbelief. Then they will offer submission becoming compliant and submitting themselves to belief in God upon death saying ‘We were not doing any evil’ any associating others with God whereat the angels say ‘Nay! Surely God is Knower of what you used to do’ and will requite you for it.
فَٱدْخُلُوۤاْ أَبْوَابَ جَهَنَّمَ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا فَلَبِئْسَ مَثْوَى ٱلْمُتَكَبِّرِينَ,And it will also be said to them So enter the gates of Hell to abide therein! Evil indeed is the lodging the abode of the arrogant.
وَقِيلَ لِلَّذِينَ ٱتَّقَوْاْ مَاذَا أَنْزَلَ رَبُّكُمْ قَالُواْ خَيْراً لِّلَّذِينَ أَحْسَنُواْ فِي هٰذِهِ ٱلْدُّنْيَا حَسَنَةٌ وَلَدَارُ ٱلآخِرَةِ خَيْرٌ وَلَنِعْمَ دَارُ ٱلْمُتَّقِينَ,And it is said to those who fear idolatry ‘What has your Lord revealed?’ They will say ‘Good! For those who were virtuous by embracing faith in this world there will be a virtuous reward namely a goodly life; and truly the abode of the Hereafter that is Paradise is better than the world and all that is in it. God says the following regarding it And truly excellent is the abode of the God-fearing it the Hereafter is.
جَنَّاتُ عَدْنٍ يَدْخُلُونَهَا تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلأَنْهَارُ لَهُمْ فِيهَا مَا يَشَآؤونَ كَذَلِكَ يَجْزِي ٱللَّهُ ٱلْمُتَّقِينَ,Gardens of Eden as a place of residence jannātu ‘Adnin is a subject the predicate of which is what follows which they will enter Gardens underneath which rivers flow wherein they shall have whatever they wish. So with such a reward God rewards the God-fearing
ٱلَّذِينَ تَتَوَفَّاهُمُ ٱلْمَلاۤئِكَةُ طَيِّبِينَ يَقُولُونَ سَلامٌ عَلَيْكُمُ ٱدْخُلُواْ ٱلْجَنَّةَ بِمَا كُنْتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ,those whom alladhīna is a description the angels take away in death while they are goodly pure of any unbelief saying to them upon death ‘Peace be on you! and it is said to them in the Hereafter Enter Paradise because of what you used to do’.
هَلْ يَنْظُرُونَ إِلاَّ أَن تَأْتِيَهُمُ ٱلْمَلائِكَةُ أَوْ يَأْتِيَ أَمْرُ رَبِّكَ كَذَلِكَ فَعَلَ ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ وَمَا ظَلَمَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ وَلـٰكِن كَانُواْ أَنْفُسَهُمْ يَظْلِمُونَ,Do they the disbelievers await anything but that the angels should come to them read feminine person ta’tīhim or masculine ya’tīhim to seize their spirits or that there should come your Lord’s command? chastisement or the resurrection that entails it. So just as these have done did those before them from among the former communities they denied their messengers and were therefore destroyed. And God did not wrong them destroying them for no sin but they used to wrong themselves through disbelief.
فَأَصَابَهُمْ سَيِّئَاتُ مَا عَمِلُواْ وَحَاقَ بِهِم مَّا كَانُواْ بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِئُونَ,So that the evils of what they did smote them that is the requital of these evil things smote them and there besieged it was sent down against them that which they used to mock namely the chastisement.
وَقَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ أَشْرَكُواْ لَوْ شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ مَا عَبَدْنَا مِن دُونِهِ مِن شَيْءٍ نَّحْنُ وَلاۤ آبَاؤُنَا وَلاَ حَرَّمْنَا مِن دُونِهِ مِن شَيْءٍ كَذٰلِكَ فَعَلَ ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ فَهَلْ عَلَى ٱلرُّسُلِ إِلاَّ ٱلْبَلاغُ ٱلْمُبِينُ,And the idolaters from among the Meccans say ‘Had God willed we would not have worshipped anything besides Him — neither we nor our fathers — nor would we have deemed anything sacred besides Him’ in the way of those camels called bahīras and sā’iba. In other words our idolatry and our deeming these animals sacred are effected by His will; therefore He must be satisfied with this. God exalted He be says So did those before them that is they denied their messengers regarding that which they the messengers brought them. Yet are messengers charged with anything save plain conveyance of the Message? It is not their duty to guide.
وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِي كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولاً أَنِ ٱعْبُدُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَٱجْتَنِبُواْ ٱلْطَّاغُوتَ فَمِنْهُم مَّنْ هَدَى ٱللَّهُ وَمِنْهُمْ مَّنْ حَقَّتْ عَلَيْهِ ٱلضَّلالَةُ فَسِيرُواْ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ فَٱنظُرُواْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَاقِبَةُ ٱلْمُكَذِّبِينَ,And verily We sent forth among every community a messenger just as We have sent you forth among these Meccans to say ‘Worship God profess belief in His Oneness and shun false deities’ graven images and do not worship them. Then among them were some whom God guided and they believed and among them were some who deserved to be in error according to God’s knowledge and so they did not believe. So travel O disbelievers of Mecca in the land and observe the nature of the consequence of those who denied their messengers in that they were destroyed.
إِن تَحْرِصْ عَلَىٰ هُدَاهُمْ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لاَ يَهْدِي مَن يُضِلُّ وَمَا لَهُمْ مِّن نَّاصِرِينَ,If you O Muhammad (s) are eager for them to be guided when God has already made them go astray you will not be able to achieve this For God does not guide read passive lā yuhdā ? or active lā yahdī he whom He has already sent astray he whom He desires to send astray and they will have no helpers no protectors from God’s chastisement.
وَأَقْسَمُواْ بِٱللَّهِ جَهْدَ أَيْمَانِهِمْ لاَ يَبْعَثُ ٱللَّهُ مَن يَمُوتُ بَلَىٰ وَعْداً عَلَيْهِ حَقّاً وَلـٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ ٱلْنَّاسِ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ,And they swear by God their most earnest oaths in other words with their utmost earnestness therein that God will not resurrect the dead. God exalted be He says Nay He will resurrect them it is a promise binding upon Him both wa‘dan and haqqan are verbal nouns used for emphasis and are in the accusative because of the verbal actions implicit in them; in other words He promised that and made it a binding truth but most people that is the people of Mecca do not know that.
لِيُبَيِّنَ لَهُمُ ٱلَّذِي يَخْتَلِفُونَ فِيهِ وَلِيَعْلَمَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ أَنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ كَاذِبِينَ,That He may make clear to them li-yubayyina is semantically connected to an implied yab‘athuhum ‘He will resurrect them’ what they differ with believers in of matters of religion by punishing them and rewarding the believers and that the disbelievers may know that they were liars when they denied the Resurrection.
إِنَّمَا قَوْلُنَا لِشَيْءٍ إِذَآ أَرَدْنَاهُ أَن نَّقُولَ لَهُ كُنْ فَيَكُونُ,All that We say to a thing when We will it that is when We will that it come into existence qawlunā is a subject the predicate of which is what follows is to say to it ‘Be’ and it is in other words and that thing is a variant reading for fa-yakūnu has fa-yakūna as a supplement to naqūla. The verse is intended as an affirmation of the power of God to resurrect.
وَٱلَّذِينَ هَاجَرُواْ فِي ٱللَّهِ مِنْ بَعْدِ مَا ظُلِمُواْ لَنُبَوِّئَنَّهُمْ فِي ٱلدُّنْيَا حَسَنَةً وَلأَجْرُ ٱلآخِرَةِ أَكْبَرُ لَوْ كَانُواْ يَعْلَمُونَ,And those who emigrated for God’s cause to establish His religion after they had been wronged through harm those from among the people of Mecca — these were the Prophet s and his Companions — truly We shall lodge them in this world in a goodly lodging namely Medina and the reward of the Hereafter that is Paradise is surely greater grander did they but know that is the disbelievers — or those who stayed behind and did not emigrate — did they but know the honour that belongs to emigrants they would have followed them.
ٱلَّذِينَ صَبَرُواْ وَعَلَىٰ رَبِّهِمْ يَتَوَكَّلُونَ,They are those who endure the harm inflicted by the idolaters and endure the emigration in order to make manifest the religion and put their trust in their Lord so that He provides for them whence they do not reckon.
وَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ إِلاَّ رِجَالاً نُّوحِيۤ إِلَيْهِمْ فَٱسْأَلُواْ أَهْلَ ٱلذِّكْرِ إِن كُنْتُم لاَ تَعْلَمُونَ,And We did not send before you anything other than men to whom We revealed and sent not angels ‘So ask the followers of the Remembrance those knowledgeable in the Torah and the Gospels; if you do not know’ that then they know it and you are more likely to believe them than the believers are to believe Muhammad (s)
بِٱلْبَيِّنَاتِ وَٱلزُّبُرِ وَأَنْزَلْنَا إِلَيْكَ ٱلذِّكْرَ لِتُبَيِّنَ لِلنَّاسِ مَا نُزِّلَ إِلَيْهِمْ وَلَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَفَكَّرُونَ,We sent them with clear signs bi’l-bayyināt is semantically connected to an omitted verb namely We sent them with clear arguments and the Books and We have revealed to you the Remembrance the Qur’ān that you may make clear to mankind what has been revealed to them therein in the way of what is lawful and unlawful and that perhaps they might reflect upon this and take heed.
أَفَأَمِنَ ٱلَّذِينَ مَكَرُواْ ٱلسَّيِّئَاتِ أَن يَخْسِفَ ٱللَّهُ بِهِمُ ٱلأَرْضَ أَوْ يَأْتِيَهُمُ ٱلْعَذَابُ مِنْ حَيْثُ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ,Do they feel secure those who have schemed evil schemes against the Prophet s at the Council Assembly schemes such as detaining him killing him or banishing him as mentioned in sūrat al-Anfāl Q. 830 that God will not cause the earth to swallow them as God did with Qārūn Q. 2881 or that the chastisement will not come upon them whence they are not aware of? that is in a way which would not occur to them. Indeed they were destroyed at Badr even though they had never anticipated it.
أَوْ يَأْخُذَهُمْ فِي تَقَلُّبِهِمْ فَمَا هُم بِمُعْجِزِينَ,Or that He will not seize them in their going to and fro during their travels for commerce whereupon they will not be able to escape? whereupon they will not be able to elude the chastisement.
أَوْ يَأْخُذَهُمْ عَلَىٰ تَخَوُّفٍ فَإِنَّ رَبَّكُمْ لَرَؤُوفٌ رَّحِيمٌ,Or that He will not seize them amid growing fear? amid a gradual diminishing of their numbers little by little until all are destroyed ‘alā takhawwufin is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the subject of the verb God or the object. Indeed then your Lord is Gentle Merciful insofar as He does not hasten for them their punishment.
أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْاْ إِلَىٰ مَا خَلَقَ ٱللَّهُ مِن شَيْءٍ يَتَفَيَّؤُاْ ظِلاَلُهُ عَنِ ٱلْيَمِينِ وَٱلْشَّمَآئِلِ سُجَّداً لِلَّهِ وَهُمْ دَاخِرُونَ,Or have they not observed the things which God has created which cast a shadow such as trees or a mountain how their shadows incline to the right and to the left shamā’il is the plural of shimāl in other words towards both sides at the beginning of the day and at its end prostrating to God sujjadan is a circumstantial qualifier that is to say subservient to Him with respect to what is required of them and how they the shadows are subject? humbled they the shadows are likened to rational beings in this description.
وَلِلَّهِ يَسْجُدُ مَا فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِي ٱلأَرْضِ مِن دَآبَّةٍ وَٱلْمَلاۤئِكَةُ وَهُمْ لاَ يَسْتَكْبِرُونَ,And to God prostrates whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth of living creatures that is of every single thing that moves thereupon; in other words to Him it everything is subservient in terms of what is required of it — most of what is given by way of example is non-rational since these are the more numerous — and the angels also prostrate — these are singled out for mention because of their merit — and they are not arrogant they do not disdain to worship Him.
يَخَافُونَ رَبَّهُمْ مِّن فَوْقِهِمْ وَيَفْعَلُونَ مَا يُؤْمَرُونَ,They that is the angels fear yakhāfūna is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the person governing the verb yastakbirūna ‘they are not arrogant’ their Lord from above them min fawqihim is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the suffixed pronoun -hum of fawqihim in other words they fear their Lord being High above them with the power to subjugate and they do what they are commanded to do.
وَقَالَ ٱللَّهُ لاَ تَتَّخِذُواْ إِلـٰهَيْنِ ٱثْنَيْنِ إِنَّمَا هُوَ إِلـٰهٌ وَاحِدٌ فَإيَّايَ فَٱرْهَبُونِ,And God has said ‘Do not choose two gods ithnayn is for emphasis. Truly there is only One God — He has added this statement to affirm His Divinity and Oneness — so be in awe of Me alone’ fear Me to the exclusion of anyone else — herein is a shift from the third person to the first.
وَلَهُ مَا فِي ٱلْسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَلَهُ ٱلدِّينُ وَاصِباً أَفَغَيْرَ ٱللَّهِ تَتَّقُونَ,And to Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth as possessions creatures and servants. And to Him belongs the religion the obedience that endures the one everlasting wāsiban is a circumstantial qualifier referring to al-dīn ‘the religion’ and is operated by the sense of the adverbial clause. Will you then fear any other than God? when He is the True God other than Whom there is no god the interrogative is a statement of rejection and rebuke.
وَمَا بِكُم مِّن نِّعْمَةٍ فَمِنَ ٱللَّهِ ثُمَّ إِذَا مَسَّكُمُ ٱلضُّرُّ فَإِلَيْهِ تَجْأَرُونَ,Whatever grace you have it is from God none but He brings it mā ‘whatever’ is either a conditional or relative particle. Then when misfortune poverty or illness befalls you to Him you cry for help to Him you raise your voices with pleas for help and supplications and you do not call upon any other than Him.
ثُمَّ إِذَا كَشَفَ ٱلضُّرَّ عَنْكُمْ إِذَا فَرِيقٌ مِّنْكُم بِرَبِّهِمْ يُشْرِكُونَ,Then when He has rid you of the misfortune behold a group of you attribute partners to their Lord
لِيَكْفُرُواْ بِمَآ آتَيْنَاهُمْ فَتَمَتَّعُواْ فَسَوْفَ تَعْلَمُونَ,in order to deny that grace which We have given them. So enjoy that consent of yours to worship idols an imperative meant as a threat for soon you shall know the consequence of this.
وَيَجْعَلُونَ لِمَا لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ نَصِيباً مِّمّا رَزَقْنَاهُمْ تَٱللَّهِ لَتُسْأَلُنَّ عَمَّا كُنْتُمْ تَفْتَرُونَ,And they that is the idolaters assign to what they do not know that they cause harm and cannot benefit them — namely the idols — a portion of that which We have provided them with of crops and cattle saying that ‘this is for God and this is for our partners’. By God you will indeed be questioned a questioning of rebuke; there is a shift herein from the third to the second person about what you used to fabricate against God such as claiming that He commanded you to do this.
وَيَجْعَلُونَ لِلَّهِ ٱلْبَنَاتِ سُبْحَانَهُ وَلَهُمْ مَّا يَشْتَهُونَ,And they assign to God daughters by claiming that the angels are the daughters of God — Be He glorified! — a declaration that He is exalted above that which they claim — while they will have what they desire namely sons the status of this sentence is either independent nominative or that of an accusative object of the verb yaj‘alūna ‘they assign’. The meaning is that to Him they assign daughters to whom they are averse when in any case He is exalted beyond having offspring while to themselves they assign sons of their own choosing so that the best is theirs exclusively — like where God says Now ask them are daughters to be for your Lord while sons are to be for them? Q. 37149.
وَإِذَا بُشِّرَ أَحَدُهُمْ بِٱلأُنْثَىٰ ظَلَّ وَجْهُهُ مُسْوَدّاً وَهُوَ كَظِيمٌ,And when one of them is given the tidings of a girl that will be born to him his face becomes darkened transformed like that of one suddenly struck by grief and he chokes inwardly filled with anguish so how is it that daughters are attributed to Him exalted be He?
يَتَوَارَىٰ مِنَ ٱلْقَوْمِ مِن سُوۤءِ مَا بُشِّرَ بِهِ أَيُمْسِكُهُ عَلَىٰ هُونٍ أَمْ يَدُسُّهُ فِي ٱلتُّرَابِ أَلاَ سَآءَ مَا يَحْكُمُونَ,He hides disappearing from people that is from his people out of distress at the tidings given to him fearing mockery unsure what to do with it the newborn shall he retain it — refrain from killing it — in humiliation enduring shame and disgrace or trample into the dust by burying it alive. Verily wretched is what they judge evil is this judgement of theirs in which they ascribe to their Creator that His are the daughters who have such a lowly status in their eyes.
لِلَّذِينَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱلآخِرَةِ مَثَلُ ٱلسَّوْءِ وَلِلَّهِ ٱلْمَثَلُ ٱلأَعْلَىٰ وَهُوَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ,For those who do not believe in the Hereafter namely for the disbelievers there is an evil description in other words theirs is the most evil attribute meaning the most vile which is their burying alive of newborn girls despite the fact that they are needed for the purposes of marriage; and the loftiest description belongs to God His is the attribute most sublime namely that there is no god except Him. And He is the Mighty in His kingdom the Wise in His creation.
وَلَوْ يُؤَاخِذُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلنَّاسَ بِظُلْمِهِمْ مَّا تَرَكَ عَلَيْهَا مِن دَآبَّةٍ وَلٰكِن يُؤَخِّرُهُمْ إلَىٰ أَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّىٰ فَإِذَا جَآءَ أَجَلُهُمْ لاَ يَسْتَأْخِرُونَ سَاعَةً وَلاَ يَسْتَقْدِمُونَ,And if God were to take mankind to task for their wrongdoing wrongdoing through acts of disobedience He would not leave upon it that is upon the earth any living being any single living thing moving upon it; but He gives them respite until an appointed term; and when their term comes they will not defer from it by a single hour nor advance it.
وَيَجْعَلُونَ لِلَّهِ مَا يَكْرَهُونَ وَتَصِفُ أَلْسِنَتُهُمُ ٱلْكَذِبَ أَنَّ لَهُمُ ٱلْحُسْنَىٰ لاَ جَرَمَ أَنَّ لَهُمُ ٱلْنَّارَ وَأَنَّهُمْ مُّفْرَطُونَ,Still they assign to God what they dislike for themselves — such as daughters partners in power and the mistreatment of messengers. And their tongues despite this relate tell the lie which is that theirs will be the best reward with God namely Paradise as He God states in their words elsewhere ‘And in case I am returned to my Lord I will indeed have the best reward with Him’ Q. 4150. But God exalted be He says Without any doubt — verily — theirs shall be the Fire and they shall be abandoned therein or it mufratūn means that they shall be foremost in entering it a variant reading for mufratūn has mufritūn meaning that ‘they transgress the bounds’.
تَٱللَّهِ لَقَدْ أَرْسَلْنَآ إِلَىٰ أُمَمٍ مِّن قَبْلِكَ فَزَيَّنَ لَهُمُ ٱلشَّيْطَانُ أَعْمَالَهُمْ فَهُوَ وَلِيُّهُمُ ٱلْيَوْمَ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,By God We verily sent to communities before you messengers. But Satan adorned for them their deeds their evil deeds so that they considered them to be good deeds and therefore they denied the messengers. So he is their patron the guardian of their affairs today that is now in this world and for them there will be a painful chastisement in the Hereafter. It is also said that by al-yawm ‘today’ is meant the Day of Resurrection narrating the events as though they are taking place now. In other words they have no guardian other than him in other words Satan and as he is incapable of helping himself how could he possibly help them?
وَمَآ أَنْزَلْنَا عَلَيْكَ ٱلْكِتَابَ إِلاَّ لِتُبَيِّنَ لَهُمُ ٱلَّذِي ٱخْتَلَفُواْ فِيهِ وَهُدًى وَرَحْمَةً لِّقَوْمٍ يُؤْمِنُونَ,And We have not revealed to you O Muhammad (s) the Book the Qur’ān except for the purpose that you may make clear to them to mankind that wherein they differ in the matter of religion and as a guidance wa-hudan is a supplement to wa-li-tubayyina ‘and that you may make clear’ and as a mercy for a people who believe in it.
وَٱللَّهُ أَنْزَلَ مِنَ ٱلْسَّمَآءِ مَآءً فَأَحْيَا بِهِ ٱلأَرْضَ بَعْدَ مَوْتِهَآ إِنَّ فِي ذٰلِكَ لآيَةً لِقَوْمٍ يَسْمَعُونَ,And God sends down water from the heaven and therewith revives the earth with plants after its death after its drying up. Surely in that which is mentioned there is a sign indicating the truth of the Resurrection for a people who listen listening and then reflecting.
وَإِنَّ لَكُمْ فِي ٱلأَنْعَامِ لَعِبْرَةً نُّسْقِيكُمْ مِّمَّا فِي بُطُونِهِ مِن بَيْنِ فَرْثٍ وَدَمٍ لَّبَناً خَالِصاً سَآئِغاً لِلشَّارِبِينَ,And truly for you there is in the cattle a lesson an example to learn from. We give you to drink — this introduces the explanation of the ‘lesson’ — of that which is in their bellies the cattle’s bellies from min indicates a new subject and is semantically connected to nusqīkum ‘We give you to drink’ between the refuse the intestinal waste and the blood pure milk uncontaminated by either the refuse or the blood neither in its taste odour or colour even though it the milk is situated between the two palatable to drinkers easily passing down their throats not causing any choking.
وَمِن ثَمَرَاتِ ٱلنَّخِيلِ وَٱلأَعْنَابِ تَتَّخِذُونَ مِنْهُ سَكَراً وَرِزْقاً حَسَناً إِنَّ فِي ذٰلِكَ لآيَةً لِّقَوْمٍ يَعْقِلُونَ,And of the fruits of date-palms and vines comes forth a fruit from which you draw an intoxicant a wine that intoxicates — it the wine is referred to by the verbal noun sakaran ‘intoxicant’ and this verse came before it was prohibited — and goodly provision such as dates raisins vinegar and molasses. Surely in that which is mentioned there is a sign indicating His power exalted be He for a people who understand a people who reflect.
وَأَوْحَىٰ رَبُّكَ إِلَىٰ ٱلنَّحْلِ أَنِ ٱتَّخِذِي مِنَ ٱلْجِبَالِ بُيُوتاً وَمِنَ ٱلشَّجَرِ وَمِمَّا يَعْرِشُونَ,And your Lord revealed to the bee a revealing effected through inspiration saying an ‘that’ is either explicative or relates to the verbal noun ‘Choose among the hills habitations to which you can resort and among the trees also habitations and among the trellises which they raise that is the places which humans build for you — for otherwise it the bee would not resort to these places.
ثُمَّ كُلِي مِن كُلِّ ٱلثَّمَرَاتِ فَٱسْلُكِي سُبُلَ رَبِّكِ ذُلُلاً يَخْرُجُ مِن بُطُونِهَا شَرَابٌ مُّخْتَلِفٌ أَلْوَانُهُ فِيهِ شِفَآءٌ لِلنَّاسِ إِنَّ فِي ذٰلِكَ لآيَةً لِّقَوْمٍ يَتَفَكَّرُونَ,Then eat from every kind of fruit and follow enter the ways of your Lord follow His paths in seeking pastures ways made easily accessible’ dhululan is the plural of dhalūl and is a circumstantial qualifier referring to al-subul ‘the ways’ in other words those paths disposed for you such that they pose no difficulty for you even if it should be rough terrain and such that you would not lose your way when returning therefrom even if it be far away; it dhululan is also said to be a circumstantial qualifier referring to the person of the pronominal suffix of fa’slukī ‘you follow’ meaning in this case follow those paths in compliance with what is required of you. There comes forth from their bellies a drink namely honey of diverse hues wherein is a cure for mankind from all ailments; it is also said that it means that it is a cure only for some ailments as indicated by the indefinite noun shifā’un ‘a cure’; or that it is a cure for all ailments when supplemented with some other remedy; or without these other remedies but with the resolve niyya to get better. The Prophet s used to prescribe it for anyone suffering from stomach pains as reported by the two Shaykhs Bukhārī and Muslim. Surely in that there is a sign for a people who reflect upon God’s handiwork exalted be He.
وَٱللَّهُ خَلَقَكُمْ ثُمَّ يَتَوَفَّاكُمْ وَمِنكُم مَّن يُرَدُّ إِلَىٰ أَرْذَلِ ٱلْعُمُرِ لِكَيْ لاَ يَعْلَمَ بَعْدَ عِلْمٍ شَيْئاً إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلِيمٌ قَدِيرٌ,And God has created you when you were nothing then He takes you in death when your terms of life are concluded; and there are some among you who are relegated to the most abject stage of life that is the most diminished because of old-age and senility so that he knows nothing after having possessed some knowledge. ‘Ikrima said ‘Whoever recites the Qur’ān will not come to such a predicament’. God is Knowing of how to manage the affairs of His creation Powerful in doing what He will.
وَٱللَّهُ فَضَّلَ بَعْضَكُمْ عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ فِي ٱلْرِّزْقِ فَمَا ٱلَّذِينَ فُضِّلُواْ بِرَآدِّي رِزْقِهِمْ عَلَىٰ مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُهُمْ فَهُمْ فِيهِ سَوَآءٌ أَفَبِنِعْمَةِ ٱللَّهِ يَجْحَدُونَ,And God has favoured some of you above others in respect of provision thus some of you are poor some are rich some owners others are owned. Now those who have been more favoured namely the masters would not hand over their provision to those slaves whom their right hands possess that is they would not assign that wealth and other things which We have given them as something to be shared equally between them and their slaves so that they that is the slaves and their masters become equal partners in respect thereof. The meaning is they do not have partners from among their slaves in respect of their wealth so how can they make certain of God’s servants partners of His? Is it then the grace of God that they deny? that they reject when they ascribe partners to Him?
وَٱللَّهُ جَعَلَ لَكُمْ مِّنْ أَنْفُسِكُمْ أَزْوَاجاً وَجَعَلَ لَكُمْ مِّنْ أَزْوَاجِكُم بَنِينَ وَحَفَدَةً وَرَزَقَكُم مِّنَ ٱلطَّيِّبَاتِ أَفَبِٱلْبَاطِلِ يُؤْمِنُونَ وَبِنِعْمَتِ ٱللَّهِ هُمْ يَكْفُرُونَ,And God made for you mates from your own selves thus He created Eve from Adam’s rib and created all mankind from the seminal fluids of men and women and made for you from your mates children and grandchildren and He provided you with the good things of all kinds of fruits seeds and animals. Is it then in falsehood in the idol that they believe and in the grace of God that they disbelieve? when they associate others with God?
وَيَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ مَا لاَ يَمْلِكُ لَهُمْ رِزْقاً مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ شَيْئاً وَلاَ يَسْتَطِيعُونَ,And they worship besides God that is other than Him what has no power to give them any sort of provision from the heavens such as water and the earth such as plants shay’an ‘anything’ is a substitute for rizqan ‘provision’ nor do they have the capacity nor are they able to do anything — and these are the idols.
فَلاَ تَضْرِبُواْ لِلَّهِ ٱلأَمْثَالَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَعْلَمُ وَأَنْتُمْ لاَ تَعْلَمُونَ,So do not strike any similitude for God do not ascribe to God likenesses and then associate them with Him in power. Truly God knows that there is nothing like Him and you do not know this.
ضَرَبَ ٱللَّهُ مَثَلاً عَبْداً مَّمْلُوكاً لاَّ يَقْدِرُ عَلَىٰ شَيْءٍ وَمَن رَّزَقْنَاهُ مِنَّا رِزْقاً حَسَناً فَهُوَ يُنْفِقُ مِنْهُ سِرّاً وَجَهْراً هَلْ يَسْتَوُونَ ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ بَلْ أَكْثَرُهُمْ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ,God strikes a similitude mathalan this is substituted by the following ‘abdan mamlūkan a slave who is a chattel mamlūkan an adjective to distinguish him this type of slave from a free man who is the servant of God alone having no power over anything since he has no mastery and one on whom man is an indefinite noun adjectivally qualified in other words a free man We have bestowed a fair provision from Us such that he spends thereof secretly and openly that is disposing of it as he wishes the first similitude is for the idols while the second is His exalted be He. Are they equal? the powerless slaves and the dispensing free men? No. Praise belongs to God alone. But most of them that is the people of Mecca do not know the chastisement they will come to and so they associate others with God.
وَضَرَبَ ٱللَّهُ مَثَلاً رَّجُلَيْنِ أَحَدُهُمَآ أَبْكَمُ لاَ يَقْدِرُ عَلَىٰ شَيْءٍ وَهُوَ كَلٌّ عَلَىٰ مَوْلاهُ أَيْنَمَا يُوَجِّههُّ لاَ يَأْتِ بِخَيْرٍ هَلْ يَسْتَوِي هُوَ وَمَن يَأْمُرُ بِٱلْعَدْلِ وَهُوَ عَلَىٰ صِرَاطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ,And God strikes a similitude mathalan this is substituted by the following rajulayn two men one of whom is dumb from birth having no power over anything as he cannot understand nor be understood and who is a liability burdensome to his master — the legal guardian of his affairs — wherever he directs him he does not bring therefrom any good he does not succeed and this is the similitude of the disbeliever. Is he that is the dumb one mentioned equal to one who enjoins justice that is to one who is able to speak of benefit to people since he enjoins it justice and encourages others to it and follows a path a way that is straight? — this being the second man the believer — No he is not equal to him. It is also said that this last similitude is a similitude of God while the similitude of the dumb one is of the idols so that the preceding verse contains the similitude of the disbeliever and the believer.
وَلِلَّهِ غَيْبُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَمَآ أَمْرُ ٱلسَّاعَةِ إِلاَّ كَلَمْحِ ٱلْبَصَرِ أَوْ هُوَ أَقْرَبُ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,And to God belongs the Unseen of the heavens and the earth in other words the knowledge of what is hidden in them. And the matter of the Hour is but as the twinkling of an eye or it is even nearer since it takes place as a result of the words ‘Be’ and it is kun fa-yakūn. Truly God has power over all things.
وَٱللَّهُ أَخْرَجَكُم مِّن بُطُونِ أُمَّهَاتِكُمْ لاَ تَعْلَمُونَ شَيْئاً وَجَعَلَ لَكُمُ ٱلْسَّمْعَ وَٱلأَبْصَارَ وَٱلأَفْئِدَةَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ,And God brought you forth from the bellies of your mothers while you did not know anything the statement lā ta‘lamūna shay’an ‘while you did not know anything’ is a circumstantial qualifier and He gave you hearing and sight and hearts that perhaps you might give thanks to Him for this gift and become believers.
أَلَمْ يَرَوْاْ إِلَىٰ ٱلطَّيْرِ مُسَخَّرَٰتٍ فِي جَوِّ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مَا يُمْسِكُهُنَّ إِلاَّ ٱللَّهُ إِنَّ فِي ذٰلِكَ لأَيٰتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يُؤْمِنُونَ,Have they not observed the birds how they are made subservient disposed to be able to fly in the air of heaven? that is in the air between the heaven and the earth. Nothing holds them when they draw in their wings or open them lest they fall except God by His power. Indeed in that there are signs for a people who believe the signs which are that they have been created in a way that enables them to fly as well as the creation of the air in such a way that it allows for flight and the holding of them up in the air so that they do not fall.
وَٱللَّهُ جَعَلَ لَكُمْ مِّن بُيُوتِكُمْ سَكَناً وَجَعَلَ لَكُمْ مِّن جُلُودِ ٱلأَنْعَامِ بُيُوتاً تَسْتَخِفُّونَهَا يَوْمَ ظَعْنِكُمْ وَيَوْمَ إِقَامَتِكُمْ وَمِنْ أَصْوَافِهَا وَأَوْبَارِهَا وَأَشْعَارِهَآ أَثَاثاً وَمَتَاعاً إِلَىٰ حِينٍ,And it is God Who has made for you your homes as a place of rest a place that you can inhabit and He has made for you out of the skins of the cattle homes such as tents and pavilions which you find light to carry on the day of your migration your travel and on the day of your halting; and of their wool that is the sheep’s and their fur that is the camels’ and their hair that is the goats’ He has made for you furniture chattels such as rugs and blankets and wares for you to use for a while until they perish.
وَٱللَّهُ جَعَلَ لَكُمْ مِّمَّا خَلَقَ ظِلاَلاً وَجَعَلَ لَكُمْ مِّنَ ٱلْجِبَالِ أَكْنَاناً وَجَعَلَ لَكُمْ سَرَابِيلَ تَقِيكُمُ ٱلْحَرَّ وَسَرَابِيلَ تَقِيكُم بَأْسَكُمْ كَذَلِكَ يُتِمُّ نِعْمَتَهُ عَلَيْكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُسْلِمُونَ,And it is God Who has made for you from what He created of houses trees and clouds shade zilāl is the plural of zill to protect you from the heat of the sun; and He has made for you in the mountains places of refuge aknān is the plural of kinn which is a places where one can seek shelter istakanna such as a cave or a tunnel; and He has made for you garments shirts that protect you from the heat that is and also from the cold and garments that protect you from your mutual violence your warring in other words to protect you from stabbed or struck during these instances garments such as coats of mail and armour plates. So in the same way that He has created these things He perfects His favour — in this world — to you by creating that of which you have need so that you O people of Mecca might submit that you might affirm His Oneness.
فَإِن تَوَلَّوْاْ فَإِنَّمَا عَلَيْكَ ٱلْبَلاَغُ ٱلْمُبِينُ,But if they turn away if they reject Islam your duty O Muhammad (s) is only to convey the Message plainly — this was revealed before the command to fight the disbelievers.
يَعْرِفُونَ نِعْمَتَ ٱللَّهِ ثُمَّ يُنكِرُونَهَا وَأَكْثَرُهُمُ ٱلْكَافِرُونَ,They recognise God’s grace that is they affirm that it comes from Him and then deny it by associating others with Him and most of them are ungrateful.
وَيَوْمَ نَبْعَثُ مِن كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ شَهِيداً ثُمَّ لاَ يُؤْذَنُ لِلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَلاَ هُمْ يُسْتَعْتَبُونَ,And mention the day We shall raise up from every community a witness and this will be it that community’s prophet to bear witness for it and against it and this day is the Day of Resurrection; then the disbelievers will not be given permission to make excuses nor will they be asked to make amends that is nor will they be asked to repent and return to that which pleases God.
وَإِذَا رَأى ٱلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ ٱلْعَذَابَ فَلاَ يُخَفَّفُ عَنْهُمْ وَلاَ هُمْ يُنظَرُونَ,And when those who did wrong those who disbelieved behold the chastisement the Fire it shall not be lightened for them the chastisement nor will they be granted any respite any deferment from it when they see it.
وَإِذَا رَأى ٱلَّذِينَ أَشْرَكُواْ شُرَكَآءَهُمْ قَالُواْ رَبَّنَا هَـٰؤُلآءِ شُرَكَآؤُنَا ٱلَّذِينَ كُنَّا نَدْعُوْا مِن دُونِكَ فَألْقَوْا إِلَيْهِمُ ٱلْقَوْلَ إِنَّكُمْ لَكَاذِبُونَ,And when the idolaters behold their associates of devils and others they will say ‘Our Lord these are our associates whom we used to invoke whom we used to worship besides You’. But they will fling to them the saying that is they will say to them ‘You are indeed liars!’ when you say that you used to worship us — as is stated by them in another verse ‘It was not us that they worshipped’ Q. 2863; and also in the verse They will deny their worship of them Q. 1982.
وَأَلْقَوْاْ إِلَىٰ ٱللَّهِ يَوْمَئِذٍ ٱلسَّلَمَ وَضَلَّ عَنْهُم مَّا كَانُواْ يَفْتَرُونَ,And they will offer submission to God on that day that is they will have surrendered to His judgement and that which they used to invent in the way of claiming that their gods intercede for them will fail forsake them.
ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَصَدُّواْ عَن سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ زِدْنَاهُمْ عَذَاباً فَوْقَ ٱلْعَذَابِ بِمَا كَانُواْ يُفْسِدُونَ,Those who disbelieve and bar people from the way of God from His religion them We shall add chastisement to their chastisement that chastisement which they have merited for their disbelief — Ibn Mas‘ūd said ‘Their chastisment will consist of scorpions whose fangs are as long as the tallest palm trees’ — because of the corruption they used to cause by their barring people from belief.
وَيَوْمَ نَبْعَثُ فِي كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ شَهِيداً عَلَيْهِمْ مِّنْ أَنْفُسِهِمْ وَجِئْنَا بِكَ شَهِيداً عَلَىٰ هَـٰؤُلآءِ وَنَزَّلْنَا عَلَيْكَ ٱلْكِتَابَ تِبْيَاناً لِّكُلِّ شَيْءٍ وَهُدًى وَرَحْمَةً وَبُشْرَىٰ لِلْمُسْلِمِينَ,And mention the day We shall raise up from every community a witness against them from among themselves and this will be their that community’s prophet and We shall bring you O Muhammad (s) as a witness against these namely your people. And We have revealed to you the Book the Qur’ān as a clarification of all things that people might need concerning the Law and as a guidance from error and a mercy and good tidings of Paradise to those who submit those who affirm the Oneness of God.
إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَأْمُرُ بِٱلْعَدْلِ وَٱلإحْسَانِ وَإِيتَآءِ ذِي ٱلْقُرْبَىٰ وَيَنْهَىٰ عَنِ ٱلْفَحْشَاءِ وَٱلْمُنْكَرِ وَٱلْبَغْيِ يَعِظُكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَذَكَّرُونَ,Indeed God enjoins justice — that is affirmation of His Oneness or actually being fair and virtue performance of the religious obligations or that you should worship God as if you were able to see Him as reported in the hadīth; and giving to kinsfolk — He has singled it kinship out for mention by way of highlighting its importance — and He forbids lewdness fornication and abomination with regard to the stipulations of the Law abomination such as disbelief and acts of disobedience and aggression wrongdoing against people — He also singles this out for mention by way of showing its importance; just as He began with the mention of ‘lewdness’ in this way He admonishes you through commands and prohibitions so that you might remember that you might be admonished tadhakkarūna ‘you might remember’ the original tā’ of tatadhakkarūna has been assimilated with the dhāl. In the Mustadrak of al-Hākim al-Naysābūrī it is reported from Ibn Mas‘ūd that he said ‘This verse is the most comprehensive verse in the Qur’ān in terms of what is good and what is evil’.
وَأَوْفُواْ بِعَهْدِ ٱللَّهِ إِذَا عَاهَدتُّمْ وَلاَ تَنقُضُواْ ٱلأَيْمَانَ بَعْدَ تَوْكِيدِهَا وَقَدْ جَعَلْتُمُ ٱللَّهَ عَلَيْكُمْ كَفِيلاً إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَعْلَمُ مَا تَفْعَلُونَ,And fulfil God’s covenant effected by way of pledges of allegiance and oaths and in other ways when you made a covenant and do not break your oaths after pledging them and having made God surety over you that you will fulfill the covenant for you have sworn the oath by Him the sentence wa-qad ja‘altumu’Llāha ‘alaykum kafīlan ‘and having made God surety over you’ is a circumstantial qualifier. Truly God knows what you do — this is a threat for them.
وَلاَ تَكُونُواْ كَٱلَّتِي نَقَضَتْ غَزْلَهَا مِن بَعْدِ قُوَّةٍ أَنكَاثاً تَتَّخِذُونَ أَيْمَانَكُمْ دَخَلاً بَيْنَكُمْ أَن تَكُونَ أُمَّةٌ هِيَ أَرْبَىٰ مِنْ أُمَّةٍ إِنَّمَا يَبْلُوكُمُ ٱللَّهُ بِهِ وَلَيُبَيِّنَنَّ لَكُمْ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ مَا كُنْتُمْ فِيهِ تَخْتَلِفُونَ,And do not be like her who undoes spoils her yarn that which she has spun after having made it strong having set and spun it breaking it up into fibres ankāthan is a circumstantial qualifier ankāth is the plural of nikth and means that which is undone yunkathu — this was an imbecile Meccan woman who used to spin all day and then undo it — by making tattakhidhūna is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the person of the verb takūnū ‘do not be like’ in other words what is meant is ‘do not be like her by making’ your oaths a means of deceit dakhal is what enters yadkhulu into something but does not belong to it in other words as a means of causing mischief or as trickery between you by breaking these oaths so that one group may become more numerous than another group. They used to enter into an alliance with a given group but if they encountered another more numerous and more powerful group they would renege on their alliance with the former and forge a new alliance with these latter. God only tries tests you thereby in other words by that which He enjoins in the way of fulfilling the covenant so that He may observe the obedient and the disobedient among you or when it is the case that one group is more numerous than another that He may observe whether you fulfil your obligation to them or not; and certainly He will make clear to you on the Day of Resurrection that wherein you used to differ during the life of this world with regard to covenants and otherwise by punishing he who reneged and rewarding he who was faithful to his covenant.
وَلَوْ شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ لَجَعَلَكُمْ أُمَّةً وَاحِدَةً وَلـٰكِن يُضِلُّ مَن يَشَآءُ وَيَهْدِي مَن يَشَآءُ وَلَتُسْأَلُنَّ عَمَّا كُنْتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ,For if God had willed He could have made you one community people of a single religion but He leads astray whom He will and guides whom He will and you will surely be questioned on the Day of Resurrection a questioning of rebuke about what you used to do so that you might be requited for it.
وَلاَ تَتَّخِذُوۤاْ أَيْمَانَكُمْ دَخَلاً بَيْنَكُمْ فَتَزِلَّ قَدَمٌ بَعْدَ ثُبُوتِهَا وَتَذُوقُواْ ٱلْسُّوۤءَ بِمَا صَدَدتُّمْ عَن سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ وَلَكُمْ عَذَابٌ عَظِيمٌ,And do not make your oaths a means of deceit between you — He repeats this here for emphasis — lest a foot should slip that is lest your feet should slip off the path of Islam after being steady having been set upon it and lest you should taste evil that is chastisement forasmuch as you barred people from the way of God in other words for your refraining to fulfil covenants or barring others from doing this since your custom once established will be followed by others and there be a tremendous chastisement for you in the Hereafter.
وَلاَ تَشْتَرُواْ بِعَهْدِ ٱللَّهِ ثَمَناً قَلِيلاً إِنَّمَا عِنْدَ ٱللَّهِ هُوَ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ إِن كُنْتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ,And do not sell God’s covenant for a small price of this world so that you break it in return for this small price. For truly what is with God of reward is better for you than all that is in this world — if you should know this then do not break it.
مَا عِندَكُمْ يَنفَدُ وَمَا عِندَ ٱللَّهِ بَاقٍ وَلَنَجْزِيَنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ صَبَرُوۤاْ أَجْرَهُمْ بِأَحْسَنِ مَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ,That which is with you of the things of this world will come to an end will perish but that which is with God remains it is everlasting. And He shall surely pay read la-yajziyanna or la-najziyanna ‘We shall surely pay’ those who were patient in fulfilling their covenants their reward according to the best of what they used to do ‘the best’ here means ‘the good’.
مَنْ عَمِلَ صَالِحاً مِّن ذَكَرٍ أَوْ أُنْثَىٰ وَهُوَ مُؤْمِنٌ فَلَنُحْيِيَنَّهُ حَيَاةً طَيِّبَةً وَلَنَجْزِيَنَّهُمْ أَجْرَهُم بِأَحْسَنِ مَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ,Whoever acts righteously whether male or female and is a believer him verily We shall revive with a goodly life. This is said to be life in Paradise; or it is life on earth when it is one of contentedness or one of wholesome halāl provision. And We shall surely pay them their reward according to the best of what they used to do.
فَإِذَا قَرَأْتَ ٱلْقُرْآنَ فَٱسْتَعِذْ بِٱللَّهِ مِنَ ٱلشَّيْطَانِ ٱلرَّجِيمِ,And when you recite the Qur’ān that is when you intend to recite it seek refuge in God from Satan the outcast in other words say a‘ūdhu bi’Lllāhi min al-shaytān al-rajīm ‘I seek refuge in God from the accursed Satan’.
إِنَّهُ لَيْسَ لَهُ سُلْطَانٌ عَلَىٰ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَعَلَىٰ رَبِّهِمْ يَتَوَكَّلُونَ,Indeed he has no power sway over those who believe and put their trust in their Lord.
إِنَّمَا سُلْطَانُهُ عَلَىٰ ٱلَّذِينَ يَتَوَلَّوْنَهُ وَٱلَّذِينَ هُم بِهِ مُشْرِكُونَ,His Satan’s power is only over those who choose him as their patron by obeying him and those who ascribe partners to Him that is to God.
وَإِذَا بَدَّلْنَآ آيَةً مَّكَانَ آيَةٍ وَٱللَّهُ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا يُنَزِّلُ قَالُوۤاْ إِنَّمَآ أَنتَ مُفْتَرٍ بَلْ أَكْثَرُهُمْ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ,And when We exchange a verse in place of a different verse by abrogating it and revealing another for the welfare of God’s servants — and God knows best what He reveals — they say that is the disbelievers say to the Prophet s ‘You are just a fabricator’ a liar making it up yourself. Nay most of them do not know the true nature of the Qur’ān and the benefit to God’s servants of abrogation.
قُلْ نَزَّلَهُ رُوحُ ٱلْقُدُسِ مِن رَّبِّكَ بِٱلْحَقِّ لِيُثَبِّتَ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَهُدًى وَبُشْرَىٰ لِلْمُسْلِمِينَ,Say to them ‘The Holy Spirit Gabriel has revealed it from your Lord with truth bi’l-haqq this is semantically connected to nazzala ‘he Gabriel has revealed it’ to confirm the faith of those who believe by their believing in it when it is revealed and as guidance and good tidings for those who have submitted to God’.
وَلَقَدْ نَعْلَمُ أَنَّهُمْ يَقُولُونَ إِنَّمَا يُعَلِّمُهُ بَشَرٌ لِّسَانُ ٱلَّذِي يُلْحِدُونَ إِلَيْهِ أَعْجَمِيٌّ وَهَـٰذَا لِسَانٌ عَرَبِيٌّ مُّبِينٌ,And verily wa-laqad is for confirmation We know that they say ‘It is only a human that is teaching him the Qur’ān’ — this was a Christian blacksmith whom the Prophet s used to frequent. God exalted be He says The tongue the language of him to whom they refer to whom they incline with the accusation that he is the one teaching him is foreign’; while this Qur’ān is in a clear Arabic tongue one of lucidity and clarity so how can a foreigner be teaching him?
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِآيَاتِ ٱللَّهِ لاَ يَهْدِيهِمُ ٱللَّهُ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,Indeed those who do not believe in God’s signs — God shall not guide them and there is a painful chastisement for them.
إِنَّمَا يَفْتَرِي ٱلْكَذِبَ ٱلَّذِينَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِآيَاتِ ٱللَّهِ وَأُوْلـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْكَاذِبُونَ,Only those invent falsehood who do not believe in God’s signs the Qur’an by saying that these are the words of a human and it is they who are the liars the emphasis is effected by way of repetition; wa-inna ‘and indeed’ and other combinations of inna are used in refutation of their saying ‘You are just a fabricator’ above Q. 16101.
مَن كَفَرَ بِٱللَّهِ مِن بَعْدِ إيمَانِهِ إِلاَّ مَنْ أُكْرِهَ وَقَلْبُهُ مُطْمَئِنٌّ بِٱلإِيمَانِ وَلَـٰكِن مَّن شَرَحَ بِالْكُفْرِ صَدْراً فَعَلَيْهِمْ غَضَبٌ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ عَظِيمٌ,Whoever disbelieves in God after having affirmed his faith — except for him who is compelled to pronounce a statement of unbelief and so pronounces it while his heart is at rest in faith man ‘whoever’ is either a subject or a conditional and so the predicate of this subject or the response to this conditional is an implied lahum wa‘īdun shadīd ‘there is for them a severe threat of chastisement’; this is indicated by the statement that follows — but he who opens up his breast to unbelief that is he who opens it up and expands it with unbelief meaning that his soul is content with it upon such shall be wrath from God and there is a great chastisement for them.
ذٰلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمُ ٱسْتَحَبُّواْ ٱلْحَيَاةَ ٱلْدُّنْيَا عَلَىٰ ٱلآخِرَةِ وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ لاَ يَهْدِي ٱلْقَوْمَ ٱلْكَافِرِينَ,That threat of chastisement for them is because they have preferred the life of this world they have chosen it in preference to the Hereafter and because God does not guide the disbelieving folk.
أُولَـٰئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ طَبَعَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ قُلُوبِهِمْ وَسَمْعِهِمْ وَأَبْصَارِهِمْ وَأُولَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْغَافِلُونَ,They are the ones on whose hearts God has set a seal and on their hearing and their sight as well and it is they who are heedless of what punishment is being prepared for them.
لاَ جَرَمَ أَنَّهُمْ فِي ٱلآخِرَةِ هُمُ ٱلْخَاسِرونَ,Without a doubt — verily — in the Hereafter they are the ones who will be the losers because their journey’s end shall be the Fire in which they shall be perpetually.
ثُمَّ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ لِلَّذِينَ هَاجَرُواْ مِن بَعْدِ مَا فُتِنُواْ ثُمَّ جَاهَدُواْ وَصَبَرُواْ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ مِن بَعْدِهَا لَغَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,Then indeed your Lord — as for those who emigrated to Medina after they were persecuted after they were tortured and compelled to pronounce words of unbelief a variant reading for futinū ‘they were persecuted’ has fatanū in other words ‘after they disbelieved’ or ‘after they turned people away from belief’ and then struggled and were patient in obedience — indeed your Lord after that that is after such a trial is Forgiving of them Merciful to them the predicate of the first inna ‘indeed’ is indicated by the predicate of the second one.
يَوْمَ تَأْتِي كُلُّ نَفْسٍ تُجَادِلُ عَن نَّفْسِهَا وَتُوَفَّىٰ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ مَّا عَمِلَتْ وَهُمْ لاَ يُظْلَمُونَ,Mention the day when every soul will come pleading arguing for itself not concerned for any other soul — this is the Day of Resurrection — and every soul will be repaid the requital of what it has done and they will not be wronged at all.
وَضَرَبَ ٱللَّهُ مَثَلاً قَرْيَةً كَانَتْ آمِنَةً مُّطْمَئِنَّةً يَأْتِيهَا رِزْقُهَا رَغَداً مِّن كُلِّ مَكَانٍ فَكَفَرَتْ بِأَنْعُمِ ٱللَّهِ فَأَذَاقَهَا ٱللَّهُ لِبَاسَ ٱلْجُوعِ وَٱلْخَوْفِ بِمَا كَانُواْ يَصْنَعُونَ,And God strikes a similitude mathalan is substituted by the following qaryatan a town Mecca — meaning its inhabitants — secure from any raids never becoming agitated and peaceful without anyone ever needing to emigrate from it on account of anxiety or fear its provision coming to it plenteously abundantly from every place. But it rejected God’s graces by denying the Prophet s so God made it taste the garb of hunger and so they suffered seven years of drought and fear as a result of the raiding parties of the Prophet s all because of what they used to do.
وَلَقَدْ جَآءَهُمْ رَسُولٌ مِّنْهُمْ فَكَذَّبُوهُ فَأَخَذَهُمُ ٱلْعَذَابُ وَهُمْ ظَالِمُونَ,And verily there came to them a messenger from among them Muhammad (s) but they denied him and so the chastisement of hunger and fear seized them while they were evildoers.
فَكُلُواْ مِمَّا رَزَقَكُمُ ٱللَّهُ حَلَـٰلاً طَيِّباً وَٱشْكُرُواْ نِعْمَتَ ٱللَّهِ إِن كُنْتُمْ إِيَّاهُ تَعْبُدُونَ,So eat O believers of the lawful and good food which God has provided you and be thankful for God’s grace if it is Him that you worship.
إِنَّمَا حَرَّمَ عَلَيْكُمُ ٱلْمَيْتَةَ وَٱلْدَّمَ وَلَحْمَ ٱلْخَنْزِيرِ وَمَآ أُهِلَّ لِغَيْرِ ٱللَّهِ بِهِ فَمَنِ ٱضْطُرَّ غَيْرَ بَاغٍ وَلاَ عَادٍ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,He has forbidden you only carrion blood the flesh of swine and that which has been hallowed to other than God. Yet whoever is compelled neither craving nor transgressing then truly God is Forgiving Merciful.
وَلاَ تَقُولُواْ لِمَا تَصِفُ أَلْسِنَتُكُمُ ٱلْكَذِبَ هَـٰذَا حَلاَلٌ وَهَـٰذَا حَرَامٌ لِّتَفْتَرُواْ عَلَىٰ ٱللَّهِ ٱلْكَذِبَ إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يَفْتَرُونَ عَلَىٰ ٱللَّهِ ٱلْكَذِبَ لاَ يُفْلِحُونَ,And do not say concerning that which your own tongues qualify falsehood such as ‘This is lawful and this is unlawful’ for what God respectively has not made lawful and what He has not made unlawful in order to invent lies against God by attributing such claims to Him. Truly those who invent lies against God will not prosper.
مَتَاعٌ قَلِيلٌ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,For them there will be a brief enjoyment in this world and for them in the Hereafter there will be a painful chastisement.
وَعَلَىٰ ٱلَّذِينَ هَادُواْ حَرَّمْنَا مَا قَصَصْنَا عَلَيْكَ مِن قَبْلُ وَمَا ظَلَمْنَاهُمْ وَلَـٰكِن كَانُوۤاْ أَنْفُسَهُمْ يَظْلِمُونَ,And to those of Jewry that is the Jews We forbade that which We have related to you already in the verse And to those of Jewry We forbade every beast with hoof … to the end Q. 6146; and We did not wrong them by forbidding them that but they used to wrong themselves by committing acts of disobedience which necessarily bring about such consequences.
ثُمَّ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ لِلَّذِينَ عَمِلُواْ ٱلسُّوۤءَ بِجَهَالَةٍ ثُمَّ تَابُواْ مِن بَعْدِ ذَلِكَ وَأَصْلَحُوۤاْ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ مِن بَعْدِهَا لَغَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,Then indeed your Lord — to those who did evil associating others with God out of ignorance and then repented returned to God’s way after that and made amends in their actions — indeed your Lord after that that is after that ignorance or that repentance is Forgiving of them Merciful to them.
إِنَّ إِبْرَاهِيمَ كَانَ أُمَّةً قَانِتاً لِلَّهِ حَنِيفاً وَلَمْ يَكُ مِنَ ٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ,Truly Abraham was a community a leader imām a good example comprising in his character all the good traits obedient to God a hanīf inclining towards the upright religion and he was not of the idolaters;
شَاكِراً لأَنْعُمِهِ ٱجْتَبَاهُ وَهَدَاهُ إِلَىٰ صِرَاطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ,grateful as he was for His graces He chose him elected him and guided him to a straight path.
وَآتَيْنَاهُ فِي ٱلْدُّنْيَا حَسَنَةً وَإِنَّهُ فِي ٱلآخِرَةِ لَمِنَ ٱلصَّالِحِينَ,And We gave him herein is a shift to the first person plural from the third person in this world good which is handsome praise of him by members of all three religions and in the Hereafter he will indeed be among the righteous for whom there will be the highest degrees of reward.
ثُمَّ أَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَيْكَ أَنِ ٱتَّبِعْ مِلَّةَ إِبْرَاهِيمَ حَنِيفاً وَمَا كَانَ مِنَ ٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ,Then We revealed to you O Muhammad (s) saying ‘Follow the creed the religion of Abraham a hanīf and he was not of the idolaters’ this remark is repeated in order to refute to the claim of the Jews and Christians that they follow his religion.
إِنَّمَا جُعِلَ ٱلسَّبْتُ عَلَىٰ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱخْتَلَفُواْ فِيهِ وَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَيَحْكُمُ بَيْنَهُمْ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ فِيمَا كَانُواْ فِيهِ يَخْتَلِفُونَ,The Sabbath was only prescribed in other words its consecration was made obligatory only for those who differed concerning it with their prophet — these were the Jews. They were commanded to devote themselves solely to worship on Friday but they said ‘We do not want it’ and chose Saturday; consequently thereon the observance of it was enforced strictly on them; and lo! your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that wherein they used to differ with regard this matter of the Sabbath by rewarding the obedient and chastising the one who disobeyed by his violating its sanctity.
ٱدْعُ إِلَىٰ سَبِيلِ رَبِّكَ بِٱلْحِكْمَةِ وَٱلْمَوْعِظَةِ ٱلْحَسَنَةِ وَجَٰدِلْهُم بِٱلَّتِي هِيَ أَحْسَنُ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ هُوَ أَعْلَمُ بِمَن ضَلَّ عَن سَبِيلِهِ وَهُوَ أَعْلَمُ بِٱلْمُهْتَدِينَ,Call mankind O Muhammad (s) to the way of your Lord to His religion with wisdom with the Qur’ān and fair exhortation its the Qur’ān’s fair exhortations or with gentle words and dispute with them by way of that which that is by way of that manner of disputation which is best such as calling them to God by way of His signs and calling them to His definitive arguments. Truly your Lord knows best that is He is fully knowledgeable of those who stray from His way and He knows best those who are guided and will requite them — this was revealed before the command to fight them.
وَإِنْ عَاقَبْتُمْ فَعَاقِبُواْ بِمِثْلِ مَا عُوقِبْتُمْ بِهِ وَلَئِن صَبَرْتُمْ لَهُوَ خَيْرٌ لِّلصَّابِرينَ,After Hamza b. ‘Abd al-Muttalib had been killed and mutilated and the Prophet s had seen him and said ‘Verily I will mutilate 70 of them for you’ the following was revealed And if you retaliate retaliate with the like of what you have been made to suffer; and yet if you endure patiently refraining from revenge verily that namely that enduring is better for the patient. Thus the Prophet s refrained from taking revenge and made atonement for his oath as reported by al-Bazzār.
وَٱصْبِرْ وَمَا صَبْرُكَ إِلاَّ بِٱللَّهِ وَلاَ تَحْزَنْ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلاَ تَكُ فِي ضَيْقٍ مِّمَّا يَمْكُرُونَ,So be patient and your patience is only by the help of God only by His assistance. And do not grieve for them that is for the disbelievers if they do not believe despite your eagerness that they believe nor be in distress because of that which they scheme in other words do not be concerned with their scheming for I God will make victorious over them.
إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ مَعَ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱتَّقَواْ وَّٱلَّذِينَ هُم مُّحْسِنُونَ,Truly God is with those who fear falling into unbelief and committing acts of disobedience and those who are virtuous by way of obedience and patience granting them assistance and victory.
سُبْحَانَ ٱلَّذِى أَسْرَىٰ بِعَبْدِهِ لَيْلاً مِّنَ ٱلْمَسْجِدِ ٱلْحَرَامِ إِلَىٰ ٱلْمَسْجِدِ ٱلأَقْصَا ٱلَّذِي بَارَكْنَا حَوْلَهُ لِنُرِيَهُ مِنْ آيَاتِنَآ إِنَّهُ هُوَ ٱلسَّمِيعُ ٱلبَصِيرُ,Glory be to Him — an affirmation of God’s transcendence — Who carried His servant Muhammad (s) by night laylan is in the accusative as an adverbial qualification; isrā’ means ‘to travel by night’; what is instructive about this mention of laylan ‘by night’ is that through its being indefinite there is an indication of the brevity of its duration from the Sacred Mosque that is Mecca to the Farthest Mosque the Holy House of Jerusalem so called because of its distance from the former; the environs of which We have blessed with fruits and rivers that We might show him some of Our signs the marvels of Our power. Indeed He is the Hearing the Seeing that is to say the Knower of the Prophet’s s sayings and deeds. Thus He God was gracious to him by way of carrying him on the night journey which comprised his encountering the other prophets his ascension to heaven and the sight of the marvels of the Divine Realm and His communion exalted be He with him. For he the Prophet s said ‘I was brought al-Burāq a white animal larger than a donkey but smaller than a mule; it was able to place its hoof back towards its extremity and so I mounted it. It set off carrying me until I reached the Holy House of Jerusalem. There I fastened the animal to the ring where the prophets fasten their animals. I then went in and prayed two units inside it. As I came out Gabriel came to me with a jug of wine and a jug of milk and so I chose the milk. Gabriel said to me “You have made the right choice by choosing the primordial nature fitra”.’ He the Prophet continued the narration ‘We then ascended to the heaven of this world whereat Gabriel asked to be let in. Someone asked “Who are you?”. He replied “Gabriel” “And who is with you?” “Muhammad (s)” he said. “Has he been sent for?”. “Yes he has been sent for”. Then it was opened for us and lo! Adam stood before me; he greeted me and prayed for well-being for me. We then ascended to the second heaven and Gabriel asked to be let in. Someone asked “Who are you?”. He replied “Gabriel” “And who is with you?” “Muhammad (s)” he said.
وَآتَيْنَآ مُوسَى ٱلْكِتَابَ وَجَعَلْنَاهُ هُدًى لِّبَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ أَلاَّ تَتَّخِذُواْ مِن دُونِي وَكِيلاً,God exalted be He says And We gave Moses the Scripture the Torah and made it a guidance for the Children of Israel saying that they should not choose beside Me any guardian to whom they delegate their affairs a variant reading for yattakhidhū ‘they should not choose’ is tattakhidhū ‘you should not choose’ thus turning away from the third person address in which case the particle an ‘that’ is extra and the ‘saying’ is implicit.
ذُرِّيَّةَ مَنْ حَمَلْنَا مَعَ نُوحٍ إِنَّهُ كَانَ عَبْداً شَكُوراً,descendants of those whom We carried with Noah in the Ark. Indeed he was a grateful servant giving thanks to Us frequently and offering praise in whichever state he found himself.
وَقَضَيْنَآ إِلَىٰ بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ فِي ٱلْكِتَابِ لَتُفْسِدُنَّ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ مَرَّتَيْنِ وَلَتَعْلُنَّ عُلُوّاً كَبِيراً,And We decreed We revealed to the Children of Israel in the Scripture the Torah ‘You shall indeed work corruption in the land the land of Syria through acts of disobedience twice and you shall indeed become great tyrants’ you shall perpetrate grave injustice.
فَإِذَا جَآءَ وَعْدُ أُولاهُمَا بَعَثْنَا عَلَيْكُمْ عِبَاداً لَّنَآ أُوْلِي بَأْسٍ شَدِيدٍ فَجَاسُواْ خِلاَلَ ٱلدِّيَارِ وَكَانَ وَعْداً مَّفْعُولاً,So when the time for the first of the two prophecies the first of the two occasions for corruption came We roused against you servants of Ours of great might men who are strong in war and assault who ransacked who came and went seeking you out through your habitations in the very midst of your homes in order to slay you and take others among you captive and it was a promise fulfilled. Their first act of corruption was their slaying of the prophet Zachariah. So Goliath and his army were roused against them and they slew them and took their children captive and destroyed the Holy House of Jerusalem.
ثُمَّ رَدَدْنَا لَكُمُ ٱلْكَرَّةَ عَلَيْهِمْ وَأَمْدَدْنَاكُم بِأَمْوَالٍ وَبَنِينَ وَجَعَلْنَاكُمْ أَكْثَرَ نَفِيراً,Then We gave you back the turn the rule of the state and victory to prevail over them one hundred years later by having Goliath slain and We aided you with children and wealth and made you greater in number in clan.
إِنْ أَحْسَنْتُمْ أَحْسَنْتُمْ لأَنْفُسِكُمْ وَإِنْ أَسَأْتُمْ فَلَهَا فَإِذَا جَآءَ وَعْدُ ٱلآخِرَةِ لِيَسُوءُواْ وُجُوهَكُمْ وَلِيَدْخُلُواْ ٱلْمَسْجِدَ كَمَا دَخَلُوهُ أَوَّلَ مَرَّةٍ وَلِيُتَبِّرُواْ مَا عَلَوْاْ تَتْبِيراً,And We said ‘If you are virtuous through acts of obedience you are being virtuous to your own souls since the reward thereof is for them your souls; and if you do evil by way of working corruption it is for them’ your evildoing. So when the time the occasion for the other prophecy comes We will raise them forth that they might ravage you make you grieve through their slaying and taking captive of you a grief that will be manifest on your faces and that they might enter the Temple the Holy House of Jerusalem and destroy it just as they entered it and destroyed it the first time and that they might destroy lay waste all that they conquered all that they gained ascendancy over utterly with an utter wasting. They indeed wrought corruption a second time when they slew the prophet John. Thus Nebuchadnezzar was roused against them and so he slew thousands of them and took their children captive and destroyed the Holy House of Jerusalem.
عَسَىٰ رَبُّكُمْ أَن يَرْحَمَكُمْ وَإِنْ عُدتُّمْ عُدْنَا وَجَعَلْنَا جَهَنَّمَ لِلْكَافِرِينَ حَصِيراً,And We said in the Scripture It may be that your Lord will have mercy upon you after the second time if you were to repent; but if you revert to working corruption We too will revert to punishment. And assuredly they did revert by denying the Prophet s and so he was given power over them through the slaying of the Banū Qurayza the expulsion of the Banū Nadīr and the exacting of the jizya-tax from them; and We have made Hell a dungeon for the disbelievers a place of detention and a prison for them.
إِنَّ هَـٰذَا ٱلْقُرْآنَ يَهْدِي لِلَّتِي هِيَ أَقْوَمُ وَيُبَشِّرُ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ ٱلَّذِينَ يَعْمَلُونَ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ أَنَّ لَهُمْ أَجْراً كَبِيراً,Truly this Qur’ān guides to that to that way which is straightest most upright and correct and gives tidings to the believers who perform righteous deeds that there is a great reward for them.
وأَنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱلآخِرَةِ أَعْتَدْنَا لَهُمْ عَذَاباً أَلِيماً,And it this Qur’ān informs that those who do not believe in the Hereafter We have prepared for them a painful chastisement namely the Fire.
وَيَدْعُ ٱلإِنْسَانُ بِٱلشَّرِّ دُعَآءَهُ بِٱلْخَيْرِ وَكَانَ ٱلإِنْسَانُ عَجُولاً,And man prays for ill against himself and his family when he is frustrated as avidly as he prays for good. And mankind is ever hasty to pray against himself without contemplating the consequence thereof.
وَجَعَلْنَا ٱلَّيلَ وَٱلنَّهَارَ آيَتَيْنِ فَمَحَوْنَآ آيَةَ ٱلَّيلِ وَجَعَلْنَآ آيَةَ ٱلنَّهَارِ مُبْصِرَةً لِتَبْتَغُواْ فَضْلاً مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَلِتَعْلَمُواْ عَدَدَ ٱلسِّنِينَ وَٱلْحِسَابَ وَكُلَّ شَيْءٍ فَصَّلْنَاهُ تَفْصِيلاً,And We made the night and the day two signs both indicators of Our power. Then We effaced the sign of the night extinguishing its light with darkness so that you might repose therein the annexation āyata’layli ‘the sign of the night’ is explicative and made the sign of the day sight-giving in other words one in which it is possible to see because of the light; that you may seek therein bounty from your Lord by earning your livelihood and that you may know by both day and night the number of years and the reckoning of the times of the day and everything that might be needed We have detailed very distinctly We have explained clearly.
وَكُلَّ إِنْسَانٍ أَلْزَمْنَاهُ طَآئِرَهُ فِي عُنُقِهِ وَنُخْرِجُ لَهُ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ كِتَاباً يَلْقَاهُ مَنْشُوراً,And We have attached every person’s omen — his deeds — for him to carry upon his neck — this site is singled out for mention because fastening something to it is much more severe; Mujāhid b. Jabr al-Makkī said ‘There is not a child born but it has a leaf around its neck in which it is decreed that the child will be either fortunate or damned’ — and We shall bring forth for him on the Day of Resurrection a book in which his deeds are recorded and which he will find wide open yalqāhu manshūran both are adjectival qualifications of kitāban ‘a book’.
ٱقْرَأْ كِتَٰبَكَ كَفَىٰ بِنَفْسِكَ ٱلْيَوْمَ عَلَيْكَ حَسِيباً,And it will be said to him ‘Read your book! This day your soul suffices as your own reckoner’.
مَّنِ ٱهْتَدَىٰ فَإِنَّمَا يَهْتَدي لِنَفْسِهِ وَمَن ضَلَّ فَإِنَّمَا يَضِلُّ عَلَيْهَا وَلاَ تَزِرُ وَازِرَةٌ وِزْرَ أُخْرَىٰ وَمَا كُنَّا مُعَذِّبِينَ حَتَّىٰ نَبْعَثَ رَسُولاً,Whoever is guided is guided only to the good of his own soul because the reward of his guidance will be for him; and whoever goes astray goes astray only to its his soul’s detriment because the sin thereof will be held against it. No burdened no sinful soul shall bear the burden of another soul. And We never chastise anyone until We have sent a messenger to make clear to him that which is his obligation.
وَإِذَآ أَرَدْنَآ أَن نُّهْلِكَ قَرْيَةً أَمَرْنَا مُتْرَفِيهَا فَفَسَقُواْ فِيهَا فَحَقَّ عَلَيْهَا ٱلْقَوْلُ فَدَمَّرْنَاهَا تَدْمِيراً,And when We desire to destroy a town We command its affluent ones those inhabitants of its who enjoy the graces of God meaning its leaders We command them to obedience by the tongue of Our messengers; but they fall into immorality therein rebelling against Our command and so the Word is justified concerning it that it should be chastised and We destroy it utterly We annihilate it by annihilating its inhabitants and leaving it in ruins.
وَكَمْ أَهْلَكْنَا مِنَ ٱلْقُرُونِ مِن بَعْدِ نُوحٍ وَكَفَىٰ بِرَبِّكَ بِذُنُوبِ عِبَادِهِ خَبِيرَاً بَصِيراً,How many — in other words many — generations communities We have destroyed since Noah! And your Lord suffices as One Informed and Beholder of the sins of His servants Knower of the hidden and manifest aspects of these sins bi-rabbika ‘your Lord’ is semantically connected to bi-dhunūb ‘of the sins’.
مَّن كَانَ يُرِيدُ ٱلْعَاجِلَةَ عَجَّلْنَا لَهُ فِيهَا مَا نَشَآءُ لِمَن نُّرِيدُ ثُمَّ جَعَلْنَا لَهُ جَهَنَّمَ يَصْلاهَا مَذْمُوماً مَّدْحُوراً,Whoever desires through his deeds the hasty world that is the life of this world We hasten for him therein whatever We will for whom We please such a hastening li-man nurīd ‘for whom We please’ is a substitute for lahu ‘for him’ with the repetition of the genitive particle li-. Then We appoint for him in the Hereafter Hell to which he will be exposed to which he will be admitted condemned blameful and rejected banished from God’s mercy.
وَمَنْ أَرَادَ ٱلآخِرَةَ وَسَعَىٰ لَهَا سَعْيَهَا وَهُوَ مُؤْمِنٌ فَأُولَئِكَ كَانَ سَعْيُهُم مَّشْكُوراً,And whoever desires the Hereafter and strives for it with the necessary effort that is he performs the deeds worthy of it being a believer wa-huwa mu’minun is a circumstantial qualifier — for such their effort will find favour with God that is their effort will be accepted and rewarded.
كُلاًّ نُّمِدُّ هَـٰؤُلاۤءِ وَهَـٰؤُلاۤءِ مِنْ عَطَآءِ رَبِّكَ وَمَا كَانَ عَطَآءُ رَبِّكَ مَحْظُوراً,Each of the two parties We supply We give to these and to those hā’ūlā’ wa-hā’ūlā’ is a substitute for kullan ‘each’ from min is semantically connected to numiddu ‘We supply’ from your Lord’s bounty in this world. And your Lord’s bounty therein is not confined it is not forbidden to anyone.
ٱنظُرْ كَيْفَ فَضَّلْنَا بَعْضَهُمْ عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ وَلَلآخِرَةُ أَكْبَرُ دَرَجَاتٍ وَأَكْبَرُ تَفْضِيلاً,See how We have given preference to some of them over others in provision and renown. And truly the Hereafter is greater grander in degrees and greater in preferment to this world and so one ought to devote one’s attention to it the Hereafter to the exclusion of the other.
لاَّ تَجْعَل مَعَ ٱللَّهِ إِلَـٰهاً آخَرَ فَتَقْعُدَ مَذْمُوماً مَّخْذُولاً,Do not set up another god besides God or you will sit blameworthy forsaken with no one to assist you.
وَقَضَىٰ رَبُّكَ أَلاَّ تَعْبُدُوۤاْ إِلاَّ إِيَّاهُ وَبِٱلْوَالِدَيْنِ إِحْسَاناً إِمَّا يَبْلُغَنَّ عِندَكَ ٱلْكِبَرَ أَحَدُهُمَا أَوْ كِلاَهُمَا فَلاَ تَقُل لَّهُمَآ أُفٍّ وَلاَ تَنْهَرْهُمَا وَقُل لَّهُمَا قَوْلاً كَرِيماً,And your Lord has decreed He has commanded that you worship none save Him and that you show kindness to parents by being dutiful to them. If they should reach old age with you one of them ahaduhumā is the subject of the verb or both a variant reading for yablughanna has yablughān ‘both should reach’ in which case ahaduhumā would be substituting for the dual indicator alif of yablughān then do not say to them ‘Fie’ read uffan or uffin uffa or uffi a verbal noun meaning tabban ‘perish!’ or qubhan ‘evil!’ nor repulse them but speak to them gracious words fair and gentle words.
وَٱخْفِضْ لَهُمَا جَنَاحَ ٱلذُّلِّ مِنَ ٱلرَّحْمَةِ وَقُل رَّبِّ ٱرْحَمْهُمَا كَمَا رَبَّيَانِي صَغِيراً,And lower to them the wing of humility show them your submissive side out of mercy that is on account of your affection for them and say ‘My Lord have mercy on them just as they had mercy on me when they reared me when I was little’.
رَّبُّكُمْ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا فِي نُفُوسِكُمْ إِن تَكُونُواْ صَالِحِينَ فَإِنَّهُ كَانَ لِلأَوَّابِينَ غَفُوراً,Your Lord knows best what is in your hearts in the way of what may be concealed of dutifulness or disobedience to parents. If you are righteous obedient to God then truly to those who are penitent those who return to obedience of Him He is Forgiving of any slip that might have issued on their part regarding their duty to the parents so long as they do not conceal within themselves any disrespect towards them.
وَآتِ ذَا ٱلْقُرْبَىٰ حَقَّهُ وَٱلْمِسْكِينَ وَٱبْنَ ٱلسَّبِيلِ وَلاَ تُبَذِّرْ تَبْذِيراً,And give the kinsman his due of dutifulness and kindness and the needy and the traveller as well; and do not squander by expending for any purpose other than in obedience to God.
إِنَّ ٱلْمُبَذِّرِينَ كَانُوۤاْ إِخْوَانَ ٱلشَّيَاطِينِ وَكَانَ ٱلشَّيْطَانُ لِرَبِّهِ كَفُوراً,Indeed squanderers are brothers of devils that is they follow their way and the Devil was ever ungrateful to his Lord extremely rejective of His graces likewise his brother the squanderer.
وَإِمَّا تُعْرِضَنَّ عَنْهُمُ ٱبْتِغَآءَ رَحْمَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّكَ تَرْجُوهَا فَقُل لَّهُمْ قَوْلاً مَّيْسُوراً,But if you have to overlook them that is the kinsmen and the others mentioned and do not give to them seeking mercy from your Lord a mercy which you expect in the future that is you do not give to them because of a request for provision which you are waiting to come to you from your Lord before you give to them then speak to them gentle words pleasant and reasonable words promising them that you will give to them when the provision from God arrives.
وَلاَ تَجْعَلْ يَدَكَ مَغْلُولَةً إِلَىٰ عُنُقِكَ وَلاَ تَبْسُطْهَا كُلَّ ٱلْبَسْطِ فَتَقْعُدَ مَلُوماً مَّحْسُوراً,And do not keep your hand chained to your neck in other words do not withhold it completely from expending nor open it in order to expend completely or you will sit blameworthy — this refers to the first case — and denuded cut off having nothing — this refers to the latter case.
إِنَّ رَبَّكَ يَبْسُطُ ٱلرِّزْقَ لِمَن يَشَآءُ وَيَقْدِرُ إِنَّهُ كَانَ بِعِبَادِهِ خَبِيراً بَصِيراً,Truly your Lord expands provision He makes it abundant for whomever He will and He straitens He restricts it for whomever He will. Indeed He is ever Aware and Seer of His servants Knower of what they hide and what they manifest giving them provision in accordance with their welfare.
وَلاَ تَقْتُلُوۤاْ أَوْلادَكُمْ خَشْيَةَ إِمْلاقٍ نَّحْنُ نَرْزُقُهُمْ وَإِيَّاكُم إنَّ قَتْلَهُمْ كَانَ خِطْئاً كَبِيراً,And do not slay your children by burying them alive fearing penury poverty. We shall provide for them and for you. Slaying them is truly a great sin.
وَلاَ تَقْرَبُواْ ٱلزِّنَىٰ إِنَّهُ كَانَ فَاحِشَةً وَسَآءَ سَبِيلاً,And do not come anywhere near fornication — this form of expressing it is more effective than saying ‘Do not commit it’. It is indeed an indecency an abomination and it is an evil way.
وَلاَ تَقْتُلُواْ ٱلنَّفْسَ ٱلَّتِي حَرَّمَ ٱللَّهُ إِلاَّ بِٱلحَقِّ وَمَن قُتِلَ مَظْلُوماً فَقَدْ جَعَلْنَا لِوَلِيِّهِ سُلْطَاناً فَلاَ يُسْرِف فِّي ٱلْقَتْلِ إِنَّهُ كَانَ مَنْصُوراً,And do not slay the soul whose life God has made inviolable except with due cause. Whoever is slain wrongfully We have certainly given his heir the one inheriting from him a warrant a sanction to retaliate against the slayer; but let him not commit excess let him not overstep the bounds in slaying by slaying other than the killer of the one slain or by other than that instrument with which he the slain was killed; for he is supported by the Law.
وَلاَ تَقْرَبُواْ مَالَ ٱلْيَتِيمِ إِلاَّ بِٱلَّتِي هِيَ أَحْسَنُ حَتَّىٰ يَبْلُغَ أَشُدَّهُ وَأَوْفُواْ بِالْعَهْدِ إِنَّ ٱلْعَهْدَ كَانَ مَسْؤُولاً,And do not come anywhere near an orphan’s property except in the fairest manner until he comes of age. And fulfil the covenant should you make a covenant with God or with people in general. Indeed the covenant will be enquired into.
وَأَوْفُوا ٱلْكَيْلَ إِذا كِلْتُمْ وَزِنُواْ بِٱلقِسْطَاسِ ٱلْمُسْتَقِيمِ ذٰلِكَ خَيْرٌ وَأَحْسَنُ تَأْوِيلاً,And give full measure complete it when you measure and weigh with a right balance with an even balance that is better and fairer in return.
وَلاَ تَقْفُ مَا لَيْسَ لَكَ بِهِ عِلْمٌ إِنَّ ٱلسَّمْعَ وَٱلْبَصَرَ وَٱلْفُؤَادَ كُلُّ أُولـٰئِكَ كَانَ عَنْهُ مَسْؤُولاً,And do not pursue that of which you have no knowledge. Indeed the hearing and the sight and the heart — of each of these it will be asked of that person what he did with them.
وَلاَ تَمْشِ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ مَرَحاً إِنَّكَ لَن تَخْرِقَ ٱلأَرْضَ وَلَن تَبْلُغَ ٱلْجِبَالَ طُولاً,And do not walk in the earth exultantly that is exultant with pride and conceit. Indeed you will not rend the earth you will not pierce it and reach its depths with your pride nor attain the mountains in height the meaning is that you shall never attain such ends so how can you be so arrogant?
كُلُّ ذٰلِكَ كَانَ سَيِّئُهُ عِنْدَ رَبِّكَ مَكْرُوهاً,All of that which has been mentioned — the evil of it is hateful in the sight of your Lord.
ذَلِكَ مِمَّآ أَوْحَىٰ إِلَيْكَ رَبُّكَ مِنَ ٱلْحِكْمَةِ وَلاَ تَجْعَلْ مَعَ ٱللَّهِ إِلَـٰهاً آخَرَ فَتُلْقَىٰ فِي جَهَنَّمَ مَلُوماً مَّدْحُوراً,This is part of the wisdom the admonition which your Lord has revealed to you O Muhammad (s). And do not set up with God any other god or you will be cast into Hell blameworthy abandoned banished from God’s mercy.
أَفَأَصْفَاكُمْ رَبُّكُم بِٱلْبَنِينَ وَٱتَّخَذَ مِنَ ٱلْمَلاۤئِكَةِ إِنَاثاً إِنَّكُمْ لَتَقُولُونَ قَوْلاً عَظِيماً,Has your Lord then preferred you has He distinguished you exclusively O Meccans with sons and chosen for Himself females from among the angels? as daughters for Himself in the way that you are wont to claim. Truly by saying this you are speaking a monstrous word!
وَلَقَدْ صَرَّفْنَا فِي هَـٰذَا ٱلْقُرْآنِ لِيَذَّكَّرُواْ وَمَا يَزِيدُهُمْ إِلاَّ نُفُوراً,And verily We have dispensed We have elucidated in this Qur’ān similitudes promises of reward and threats of retribution so that they may remember that they may be admonished but it that elucidation only increases them in aversion to the Truth.
قُلْ لَّوْ كَانَ مَعَهُ آلِهَةٌ كَمَا يَقُولُونَ إِذاً لاَّبْتَغَوْاْ إِلَىٰ ذِي ٱلْعَرْشِ سَبِيلاً,Say to them ‘If there were with Him that is with God other gods as they say they would in that case have sought against the Lord of the Throne that is against God some path some way in order to fight Him off.
سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَىٰ عَمَّا يَقُولُونَ عُلُوّاً كَبِيراً,Glory be to Him — an affirmation of His transcendence — and exalted be He above what they say in the way of His having associates greatly!
تُسَبِّحُ لَهُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتُ ٱلسَّبْعُ وَٱلأَرْضُ وَمَن فِيهِنَّ وَإِن مِّن شَيْءٍ إِلاَّ يُسَبِّحُ بِحَمْدِهِ وَلَـٰكِن لاَّ تَفْقَهُونَ تَسْبِيحَهُمْ إِنَّهُ كَانَ حَلِيماً غَفُوراً,The seven heavens and the earth and all that is therein proclaim His praise they affirm His transcendence. And there is not a thing among things created but proclaims enwrapped in His praise in other words everything says subhāna’Llāh wa-bi-hamdihi ‘Glory and praise be to God’; but you do not understand their glorification because it is not proclaimed in your language. Lo! He is Forbearing Forgiving for He does not hasten to bring about your punishment.
وَإِذَا قَرَأْتَ ٱلْقُرآنَ جَعَلْنَا بَيْنَكَ وَبَيْنَ ٱلَّذِينَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱلآخِرَةِ حِجَاباً مَّسْتُوراً,And when you recite the Qur’ān We place between you and those who do not believe in the Hereafter a hidden barrier that is one that hides you from them so that they cannot see you — this was revealed regarding those who wanted to assassinate him s the Prophet.
وَجَعَلْنَا عَلَىٰ قُلُوبِهِمْ أَكِنَّةً أَن يَفْقَهُوهُ وَفِيۤ ءَاذَانِهِمْ وَقْراً وَإِذَا ذَكَرْتَ رَبَّكَ فِي ٱلْقُرْءَانِ وَحْدَهُ وَلَّوْاْ عَلَىٰ أَدْبَٰرِهِمْ نُفُوراً,And We place upon their hearts veils covers lest they should understand it lest they should understand the Qur’ān in other words and so in this way they do not understand it and in their ears a deafness a heaviness thus they cannot hear it. And when you mention your Lord alone in the Qur’ān they turn their backs in aversion to it.
نَّحْنُ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا يَسْتَمِعُونَ بِهِ إِذْ يَسْتَمِعُونَ إِلَيْكَ وَإِذْ هُمْ نَجْوَىٰ إِذْ يَقُولُ ٱلظَّالِمُونَ إِن تَتَّبِعُونَ إِلاَّ رَجُلاً مَّسْحُوراً,We know best what they listen to the reason for which they listen to it in order to mock it when they listen to you to your recital and when they are in secret counsel holding secret talks among themselves in other words when they talk when idh substitutes for the preceding idh ‘when’ the evildoers say in their secret conversation ‘You are only following a man bewitched one duped his mind overcome’.
ٱنْظُرْ كَيْفَ ضَرَبُواْ لَكَ ٱلأَمْثَالَ فَضَلُّواْ فَلاَ يَسْتَطِيعْونَ سَبِيلاً,God exalted be He says Look how they strike similitudes for you such as your being bewitched a soothsayer or a poet and they go astray thereby from the path of guidance and cannot find a way a path to it!
وَقَالُوۤاْ أَءِذَا كُنَّا عِظَاماً وَرُفَاتاً أَءِنَّا لَمَبْعُوثُونَ خَلْقاً جَدِيداً,And they say in denial of the Resurrection ‘What when we are bones and fragments shall we really be raised up in a new creation?’
قُلْ كُونُواْ حِجَارَةً أَوْ حَدِيداً,Say to them ‘Be stones or iron
أَوْ خَلْقاً مِّمَّا يَكْبُرُ فِي صُدُورِكُمْ فَسَيَقُولُونَ مَن يُعِيدُنَا قُلِ ٱلَّذِي فَطَرَكُمْ أَوَّلَ مَرَّةٍ فَسَيُنْغِضُونَ إِلَيْكَ رُؤُوسَهُمْ وَيَقُولُونَ مَتَىٰ هُوَ قُلْ عَسَىٰ أَن يَكُونَ قَرِيباً,or some creation yet greater in your breasts something yet far less able to accept life aside from bones and fragments a spirit will undoubtedly be made to exist in you to bring you back to life. They will then say ‘Who shall bring us back?’ to life. Say ‘He Who originated you created you the first time when you had not been anything in existence because the One Who is able to initiate creation is also able to repeat it indeed this repetition is easier than the initiation. Then they will shake their heads at you stupefied and they will say mockingly ‘When will it be?’ that is the Resurrection. Say ‘Maybe it is near!’
يَوْمَ يَدْعُوكُمْ فَتَسْتَجِيبُونَ بِحَمْدِهِ وَتَظُنُّونَ إِن لَّبِثْتُمْ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً,The day He calls you the day He calls out to you from your graves by the tongue of the archangel Isrāfīl you will respond you will answer His call from your graves with His praise by His command — it is also said to mean that you will respond ‘and praise be to Him’ — and you will think that you have remained in this world only a little because of the terror of what you will see on that day.
وَقُل لِّعِبَادِي يَقُولُواْ ٱلَّتِي هِيَ أَحْسَنُ إِنَّ ٱلشَّيْطَانَ يَنزَغُ بَيْنَهُمْ إِنَّ ٱلشَّيْطَانَ كَانَ لِلإِنْسَانِ عَدُوّاً مُّبِيناً,And tell My servants the believers to speak to disbelievers that word which is finer. For Satan indeed incites ill feeling he makes trouble between them and Satan is indeed man’s manifest enemy his enmity is evident. The ‘finer word’ is to say this
رَّبُّكُمْ أَعْلَمُ بِكُمْ إِن يَشَأْ يَرْحَمْكُمْ أَوْ إِن يَشَأْ يُعَذِّبْكُمْ وَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَاكَ عَلَيْهِمْ وَكِيلاً,Your Lord knows you best. If He will He will have mercy on you by way of granting you repentance and faith or if He will for you to be chastised He will chastise you by having you die in disbelief. And We did not send you to be a guardian over them and so compel them to embrace faith — this was revealed before the command to fight them.
وَرَبُّكَ أَعْلَمُ بِمَنْ فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَلَقَدْ فَضَّلْنَا بَعْضَ ٱلنَّبِيِّينَ عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ وَآتَيْنَا دَاوُودَ زَبُوراً,And your Lord knows best all who are in the heavens and the earth thus endowing them each one with what He will according to the measure of their states. And verily We have preferred some of the prophets above others endowing each of them with a particular merit Moses with being spoken to; Abraham with Friendship; and Muhammad (s) with the Night Journey; and We gave David the Psalms.
قُلِ ٱدْعُواْ ٱلَّذِينَ زَعَمْتُم مِّن دُونِهِ فَلاَ يَمْلِكُونَ كَشْفَ ٱلضُّرِّ عَنْكُمْ وَلاَ تَحْوِيلاً,Say to them ‘Call on those whom you assumed to be gods besides Him such as the angels Jesus and Ezra ‘Uzayr; yet they have no power to rid you of misfortune nor to transfer it to persons other than you.
أُولَـٰئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ يَدْعُونَ يَبْتَغُونَ إِلَىٰ رَبِّهِمُ ٱلْوَسِيلَةَ أَيُّهُمْ أَقْرَبُ وَيَرْجُونَ رَحْمَتَهُ وَيَخَافُونَ عَذَابَهُ إِنَّ عَذَابَ رَبِّكَ كَانَ مَحْذُوراً,Those whom they call gods they themselves seek a means to their Lord they seek nearness by way of obedience which of them ayyuhum substitutes for the third person indicator wāw of the verb yabtaghūna ‘they seek’ in other words even he seeks it this nearness the one who is nearer to Him so how much more is it sought in the case of others?; and they hope for His mercy and fear His chastisement just like others so how can you call them gods? Truly your Lord’s chastisement is a thing to beware of.
وَإِن مِّن قَرْيَةٍ إِلاَّ نَحْنُ مُهْلِكُوهَا قَبْلَ يَوْمِ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ أَوْ مُعَذِّبُوهَا عَذَاباً شَدِيداً كَانَ ذٰلِك فِي ٱلْكِتَابِ مَسْطُوراً,There is not a town — its inhabitants are the ones meant — but We shall destroy it before the Day of Resurrection through death or chastise it with terrible chastisement by killing its inhabitants or otherwise. That has been inscribed in the Book the Preserved Tablet al-lawh al-mahfūz.
وَمَا مَنَعَنَآ أَن نُّرْسِلَ بِٱلآيَاتِ إِلاَّ أَن كَذَّبَ بِهَا ٱلأَوَّلُونَ وَآتَيْنَا ثَمُودَ ٱلنَّاقَةَ مُبْصِرَةً فَظَلَمُواْ بِهَا وَمَا نُرْسِلُ بِٱلآيَاتِ إِلاَّ تَخْوِيفاً,Nothing prevented Us from sending the signs requested by the people of Mecca except that the ancients denied them when We sent such signs and so We destroyed them if We were to send them to these people of Mecca they would deny them and would thus deserve destruction. However We have judged that they be given respite so that the mission of Muhammad (s) be completed. And We gave Thamūd the she-camel as a sign that was apparent one that was clear and evident but they wronged they disbelieved it and were therefore destroyed. And We do not send signs miracles except for deterrence to servants so that they might believe.
وَإِذْ قُلْنَا لَكَ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ أَحَاطَ بِٱلنَّاسِ وَمَا جَعَلْنَا ٱلرُّءْيَا ٱلَّتِي أَرَيْنَاكَ إِلاَّ فِتْنَةً لِّلنَّاسِ وَٱلشَّجَرَةَ ٱلْمَلْعُونَةَ فِي ٱلقُرْآنِ وَنُخَوِّفُهُمْ فَمَا يَزِيدُهُمْ إِلاَّ طُغْيَاناً كَبِيراً,And remember when We said to you ‘Truly your Lord encompasses mankind’ in knowledge and power over them such that they are within His grasp so deliver the Message to them and do not fear anyone because God will protect you from them. And We did not appoint the vision that We showed you before your very eyes during the Night Journey except as a test for people for the people of Mecca — since they denied it and some of them even apostatised when he the Prophet informed them of it — and likewise the tree cursed in the Qur’ān namely the tree called Zaqqūm Q.3762ff that issues from the very root of the Blazing Fire of Hell; We made it a test for them because they said ‘Fire consumes trees so how can it cause it the Zaqqūm tree to issue forth?’. And We seek to deter them with it but it Our deterrence only increases them in gross insolence.
وَإِذْ قُلْنَا لِلْمَلاۤئِكَةِ ٱسْجُدُواْ لأَدَمَ فَسَجَدُواْ إَلاَّ إِبْلِيسَ قَالَ أَأَسْجُدُ لِمَنْ خَلَقْتَ طِيناً,And mention when We said to the angels ‘Prostrate yourselves before Adam’ a prostration of salutation by inclining oneself and so they all prostrated themselves except Iblīs he said ‘Shall I prostrate myself before one whom You have created from clay?’ tīnan is in the accusative because the operator of the oblique min ‘of’ has been omitted in other words it would normally be min tīnin.
قَالَ أَرَأَيْتَكَ هَـٰذَا ٱلَّذِي كَرَّمْتَ عَلَيَّ لَئِنْ أَخَّرْتَنِ إِلَىٰ يَوْمِ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ لأَحْتَنِكَنَّ ذُرِّيَّتَهُ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً,Said he ‘Do You see — in other words inform me this one whom You have honoured whom You have preferred above me? by commanding that prostration should be made before him when ‘I am better than him. You created me from fire while him You created from clay’ Q. 712. If la-in the lām is for oaths You defer me to the Day of Resurrection I shall verily eradicate his seed by leading them astray all save a few’ of them of those whom You have given divine protection.
قَالَ ٱذْهَبْ فَمَن تَبِعَكَ مِنْهُمْ فَإِنَّ جَهَنَّمَ جَزَآؤُكُمْ جَزَاءً مَّوْفُوراً,Said He exalted be He to him Iblīs ‘Begone deferred to the time of the First Blast of the Trumpet. Whoever of them follows you — indeed Hell shall be your requital both yours and theirs a requital that is indeed ample sufficient and complete.
وَٱسْتَفْزِزْ مَنِ ٱسْتَطَعْتَ مِنْهُمْ بِصَوْتِكَ وَأَجْلِبْ عَلَيْهِم بِخَيْلِكَ وَرَجِلِكَ وَشَارِكْهُمْ فِي ٱلأَمْوَالِ وَٱلأَوْلادِ وَعِدْهُمْ وَمَا يَعِدُهُمُ ٱلشَّيْطَانُ إِلاَّ غُرُوراً,And tempt dupe whomever of them you can with your voice by your calling them with songs and pipes and with every invitation to acts of disobedience; and rally incite against them your cavalry and your infantry namely those who ride and walk in acts of disobedience and share with them in wealth that is illicit such as usury and extortion and children from acts of adultery and make promises to them’ to the effect that there will not be any resurrection or requital. And Satan promises them thereby nothing but delusion falsehood.
إِنَّ عِبَادِي لَيْسَ لَكَ عَلَيْهِمْ سُلْطَانٌ وَكَفَىٰ بِرَبِّكَ وَكِيلاً,‘Truly as for My servants the believers you shall have no warrant’ no sway or ability. And Your Lord suffices as a guardian as a protector for them against you.
رَّبُّكُمُ ٱلَّذِي يُزْجِي لَكُمُ ٱلْفُلْكَ فِي ٱلْبَحْرِ لِتَبْتَغُواْ مِن فَضْلِهِ إِنَّهُ كَانَ بِكُمْ رَحِيماً,Your Lord is He Who drives for you the ships upon the sea that you may seek of His bounty exalted be He through engaging in commerce. Truly He is ever Merciful towards you by disposing these ships for you.
وَإِذَا مَسَّكُمُ ٱلْضُّرُّ فِي ٱلْبَحْرِ ضَلَّ مَن تَدْعُونَ إِلاَّ إِيَّاهُ فَلَمَّا نَجَّاكُمْ إِلَى ٱلْبَرِّ أَعْرَضْتُمْ وَكَانَ ٱلإِنْسَانُ كَفُوراً,And when distress difficulty befalls you at sea such as fear of drowning those whom you are wont to invoke are no longer present those whom you are wont to worship of gods are no longer present and so you do not call on them — except Him exalted be He for on Him alone you do call because you are suffering a distress which only He can remove. But when He delivers you from drowning and brings you to land you are rejective of God’s Oneness for man is ever ungrateful ever denying God’s graces.
أَفَأَمِنْتُمْ أَن يَخْسِفَ بِكُمْ جَانِبَ ٱلْبَرِّ أَوْ يُرْسِلَ عَلَيْكُمْ حَاصِباً ثُمَّ لاَ تَجِدُواْ لَكُمْ وَكِيلاً,Do you feel secure that He will not cause a side of the earth in other words the land to swallow you up as He did with Korah Qārūn or unleash upon you a squall of pebbles? that is hurl a shower of stones upon you as He did with the people of Lot. Then you will not find for yourselves any guardian any protector from Him.
أَمْ أَمِنْتُمْ أَن يُعِيدَكُمْ فِيهِ تَارَةً أُخْرَىٰ فَيُرْسِلَ عَلَيْكُمْ قَاصِفاً مِّنَ ٱلرِّيحِ فَيُغْرِقَكُم بِمَا كَفَرْتُمْ ثُمَّ لاَ تَجِدُواْ لَكُمْ عَلَيْنَا بِهِ تَبِيعاً,Or do you feel secure that He will not return you to it that is to the sea a second time and unleash upon you a shattering gale that is a violent wind that shatters everything in its path to destroy your ship and drown you for your ungratefulness? And then you will not find for yourselves any redresser of this against Us any helper or advocate to demand restitution from Us for what We will have done to you.
وَلَقَدْ كَرَّمْنَا بَنِي ءَادَمَ وَحَمَلْنَاهُمْ فِي ٱلْبَرِّ وَٱلْبَحْرِ وَرَزَقْنَاهُمْ مِّنَ ٱلطَّيِّبَاتِ وَفَضَّلْنَاهُمْ عَلَىٰ كَثِيرٍ مِّمَّنْ خَلَقْنَا تَفْضِيلاً,And verily We have honoured We have preferred the Children of Adam above other creation by giving them knowledge speech and their being a creation of even proportions amongst other things including their means of purification after death and carried them over land on animal-back and sea in ships and provided them with good things and We have preferred them above many of those whom We created such as livestock and wild animals with a marked preferment the min of mimman ‘of those whom’ has the sense of mā ‘of what’ or something close to it and includes the angels the purpose being to give preference to the angelic genus; there is no requirement to give explicit preference to the individuals of this category of being since they angels are superior to mankind excepting the prophets.
يَوْمَ نَدْعُواْ كُلَّ أُنَاسٍ بِإِمَامِهِمْ فَمَنْ أُوتِيَ كِتَابَهُ بِيَمِينِهِ فَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ يَقْرَؤونَ كِتَابَهُمْ وَلاَ يُظْلَمُونَ فَتِيلاً,Mention the day when We shall summon all men with their leader their prophet and it will be said ‘O community of so-and-so’; or it bi-imāmihim means ‘with the record of their deeds’ in which case it will be said ‘O one of good deeds O one of evil deeds!’ this is on the Day of Resurrection. And whoever from among them is given his book in his right hand these being the fortunate those possessors of understanding in this world — those will read their book and they will not be wronged they will not be diminished of their deeds so much as a single date-thread.
وَمَن كَانَ فِي هَـٰذِهِ أَعْمَىٰ فَهُوَ فِي ٱلآخِرَةِ أَعْمَىٰ وَأَضَلُّ سَبِيلاً,And whoever has been in this that is in this world blind to the truth will be blind in the Hereafter to the path of salvation and the reciting of the Qur’ān and even further astray from the right way more removed from the road that leads to it.
وَإِن كَادُواْ لَيَفْتِنُونَكَ عَنِ ٱلَّذِي أَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَيْكَ لِتَفْتَرِيَ عَلَيْنَا غَيْرَهُ وَإِذاً لاَّتَّخَذُوكَ خَلِيلاً,The following was revealed regarding the tribe of Thaqīf for they had asked him the Prophet s to declare their valley inviolable and implored him to grant them this request And indeed wa-in the particle in is softened they were about to they nearly did beguile you away from that which We revealed to you so that you might invent against Us something other than that; and then had you done that they would have taken you as a friend.
وَلَوْلاَ أَن ثَبَّتْنَاكَ لَقَدْ كِدتَّ تَرْكَنُ إِلَيْهِمْ شَيْئاً قَلِيلاً,And if We had not made you stand firm upon the Truth by way of divine protection ‘isma certainly you might have you nearly inclined to them a little because of the extent of their deception and their persistence. This statement is explicit about the fact that the Prophet s neither inclined nor came close to doing so.
إِذاً لأذَقْنَاكَ ضِعْفَ ٱلْحَيَاةِ وَضِعْفَ ٱلْمَمَاتِ ثُمَّ لاَ تَجِدُ لَكَ عَلَيْنَا نَصِيراً,Then had you inclined We would have surely made you taste a double chastisement in life and a double chastisement upon death in other words twice the chastisement that any other person would receive in this world and the Hereafter. Then you would not have found for yourself any helper against Us anyone to shield you from it.
وَإِن كَادُواْ لَيَسْتَفِزُّونَكَ مِنَ ٱلأَرْضِ لِيُخْرِجوكَ مِنْهَا وَإِذاً لاَّ يَلْبَثُونَ خِلافَكَ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً,When the Jews said to him ‘If you are a prophet then make your way to Syria for it is the land of prophets’ the following was revealed And indeed wa-in the particle in is softened they were about to provoke you out of the land the land of Medina to expel you from it but then had they expelled you they would not have remained after you in it except a little while after which they would have been destroyed.
سُنَّةَ مَن قَدْ أَرْسَلْنَا قَبْلَكَ مِن رُّسُلِنَا وَلاَ تَجِدُ لِسُنَّتِنَا تَحْوِيلاً,That is the way in the case of those whom We have sent from among Our messengers before you that is to say that is Our way of dealing with them their enemies destroying those who expel them Our messengers. And as regards Our established way you will not find any change any alternative manner.
أَقِمِ ٱلصَّلاَةَ لِدُلُوكِ ٱلشَّمْسِ إِلَىٰ غَسَقِ ٱلَّيلِ وَقُرْآنَ ٱلْفَجْرِ إِنَّ قُرْآنَ ٱلْفَجْرِ كَانَ مَشْهُوداً,Establish prayer from the sun’s decline that is from after midday until the dark of night until its darkness has fallen in other words perform prayers at noon in the afternoon at sunset and at night and the recital of the Qur’ān at dawn the morning prayer. Verily the dawn recital is ever witnessed it is witnessed by the angels of the night and the angels of the day.
وَمِنَ ٱلْلَّيْلِ فَتَهَجَّدْ بِهِ نَافِلَةً لَّكَ عَسَىٰ أَن يَبْعَثَكَ رَبُّكَ مَقَاماً مَّحْمُوداً,And for a part of the night keep vigil perform prayer therewith with the Qur’ān as a supererogatory devotion for you as an extra obligation for you to the exclusion of your community or it means as extra merit for you on top of the other obligatory prayers. It may be that your Lord will raise you to establish you in the Hereafter in a praiseworthy station one for which the first and last of mankind will praise you — and this is the station of intercession which will take place during the passing of the Final Judgement.
وَقُل رَّبِّ أَدْخِلْنِي مُدْخَلَ صِدْقٍ وَأَخْرِجْنِي مُخْرَجَ صِدْقٍ وَٱجْعَل لِّي مِن لَّدُنْكَ سُلْطَاناً نَّصِيراً,And say ‘My Lord make me enter Medina with a veritable entrance an entrance that is satisfying one in which I do not see what I dislike and bring me out of Mecca with a veritable departure a departure such that my heart will not care to turn back to look at it yearningly. And grant me from Yourself a favourable authority’ grant me strength with which You render me victorious over Your enemies.
وَقُلْ جَآءَ ٱلْحَقُّ وَزَهَقَ ٱلْبَاطِلُ إِنَّ ٱلْبَاطِلَ كَانَ زَهُوقاً,And say upon your entry into Mecca ‘The Truth Islam has come and falsehood has vanished away disbelief has come to nothing. Truly falsehood is ever bound to vanish’ ever bound to fade away and disappear. Indeed the Prophet s entered it Mecca and there were 360 idols which had been placed around the Sacred House sc. the Ka‘ba. He the Prophet then set about thrusting at them with a stick he was carrying saying those words until they had all been toppled as reported by the two Shaykhs Bukhārī and Muslim.
وَنُنَزِّلُ مِنَ ٱلْقُرْآنِ مَا هُوَ شِفَآءٌ وَرَحْمَةٌ لِّلْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَلاَ يَزِيدُ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ إَلاَّ خَسَاراً,And We reveal of min here is explicative the Qur’ān that which is a cure from error and a mercy for believers thereby; though it only increases the evildoers the disbelievers in loss because of their disbelief in it.
وَإِذَآ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَى ٱلإنْسَانِ أَعْرَضَ وَنَأَى بِجَانِبِهِ وَإِذَا مَسَّهُ ٱلشَّرُّ كَانَ يَئُوساً,And when We are gracious to man the disbelieving man he is disregardful of giving thanks and turns aside turning his face away in arrogance; but when an ill such as poverty or hardship befalls him he is in despair despondent of God’s mercy.
قُلْ كُلٌّ يَعْمَلُ عَلَىٰ شَاكِلَتِهِ فَرَبُّكُمْ أَعْلَمُ بِمَنْ هُوَ أَهْدَىٰ سَبِيلاً,Say ‘Everyone including us and you acts according to his own character his own manner of conduct and your Lord knows best who is better guided as to the way’ as to the path he follows and He will reward him accordingly.
وَيَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ ٱلرُّوحِ قُلِ ٱلرُّوحُ مِنْ أَمْرِ رَبِّي وَمَآ أُوتِيتُم مِّنَ ٱلْعِلْمِ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً,And they will question you that is the Jews concerning the Spirit from which the body receives life. Say to them ‘The Spirit is of the command of my Lord that is it belongs to His knowledge about which you know not. And of knowledge you have not been given except a little’ relative to His knowledge exalted be He.
وَلَئِن شِئْنَا لَنَذْهَبَنَّ بِٱلَّذِي أَوْحَيْنَا إِلَيْكَ ثُمَّ لاَ تَجِدُ لَكَ بِهِ عَلَيْنَا وَكِيلاً,And if la-in the lām is for oaths We willed We could take away what We have revealed to you in other words take away the Qur’ān by erasing it from the hearts of men and from the written copies. Then you would not find in respect thereof any guardian for yourself against Us;
إِلاَّ رَحْمَةً مِّن رَّبِّكَ إِنَّ فَضْلَهُ كَانَ عَلَيْكَ كَبِيراً,it is only — but We have let it remain — as a mercy from your Lord. Truly His favour to you is ever great tremendous for He has revealed to you and granted you the praiseworthy station as well as other kinds of merit.
قُل لَّئِنِ ٱجْتَمَعَتِ ٱلإِنْسُ وَٱلْجِنُّ عَلَىٰ أَن يَأْتُواْ بِمِثْلِ هَـٰذَا ٱلْقُرْآنِ لاَ يَأْتُونَ بِمِثْلِهِ وَلَوْ كَانَ بَعْضُهُمْ لِبَعْضٍ ظَهِيراً,Say ‘Verily should mankind and jinn come together to produce the like of this Qur’ān the like thereof in terms of clarity and rhetorical excellence they could not produce the like thereof even if they backed one another’ even if one was an assistant of the other. This verse was revealed as a refutation of their statement ‘If we wish we can speak the like of this’ Q. 831.
وَلَقَدْ صَرَّفْنَا لِلنَّاسِ فِي هَـٰذَا ٱلْقُرْآنِ مِن كُلِّ مَثَلٍ فَأَبَىٰ أَكْثَرُ ٱلنَّاسِ إِلاَّ كُفُوراً,And verily We have dispensed explained for people in this Qur’ān every kind of similitude min kulli mathalin this is an adjectival qualification of an omitted clause in other words ‘We have dispensed a similitude from every kind of similitude’ that they might be admonished; but most people that is the people of Mecca insist on disbelieving on denying the truth.
وَقَالُواْ لَن نُّؤْمِنَ لَكَ حَتَّىٰ تَفْجُرَ لَنَا مِنَ ٱلأَرْضِ يَنْبُوعاً,And they say wa-qālū is a supplement to abā illā ‘insist on’ ‘We will not believe you until you make gush forth for us from the ground a spring from which water issues forth;
أَوْ تَكُونَ لَكَ جَنَّةٌ مِّن نَّخِيلٍ وَعِنَبٍ فَتُفَجِّرَ ٱلأَنْهَارَ خِلالَهَا تَفْجِيراً,or until you come to have a garden an orchard of date-palms and vines and cause streams to gush forth therein in the midst of these abundantly;
أَوْ تُسْقِطَ ٱلسَّمَآءَ كَمَا زَعَمْتَ عَلَيْنَا كِسَفاً أَوْ تَأْتِيَ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلْمَلاۤئِكَةِ قَبِيلاً,or until you cause the heaven to fall upon us as you assert in pieces or bring God and the angels right in front of us face to face with us before our very eyes so that we might see them;
أَوْ يَكُونَ لَكَ بَيْتٌ مِّن زُخْرُفٍ أَوْ تَرْقَىٰ فِي ٱلسَّمَآءِ وَلَن نُّؤْمِنَ لِرُقِيِّكَ حَتَّى تُنَزِّلَ عَلَيْنَا كِتَاباً نَّقْرَؤُهُ قُلْ سُبْحَانَ رَبِّي هَلْ كُنتُ إِلاَّ بَشَراً رَّسُولاً,or until you come to have a house adorned with gold or ascend into the heaven upon a ladder and even then we will not believe your ascension if you were to ascend into it until you bring down for us therefrom a book in which is confirmed your truthfulness that we may read’. Say to them ‘Glory be to my Lord — this is a statement of amazement — Am I anything but a human a messenger from God?’ in other words I am like all other messengers for they never brought any signs except by God’s leave.
وَمَا مَنَعَ ٱلنَّاسَ أَن يُؤْمِنُوۤاْ إِذْ جَآءَهُمُ ٱلْهُدَىٰ إِلاَّ أَن قَالُوۤاْ أَبَعَثَ ٱللَّهُ بَشَراً رَّسُولاً,And nothing prevented mankind from believing when guidance came to them but that they said that is except their saying in denial ‘Has God sent a human as a messenger from Him?’ instead of sending an angel.
قُل لَوْ كَانَ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ مَلاۤئِكَةٌ يَمْشُونَ مُطْمَئِنِّينَ لَنَزَّلْنَا عَلَيْهِم مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مَلَكاً رَّسُولاً,Say to them ‘Had there been in the earth instead of humans angels walking and living secure We would have sent down to them from the heaven an angel as Messenger’ for when a messenger is sent to a people he is always of their kind so that they are able to speak to him and understand from him his message.
قُلْ كَفَىٰ بِٱللَّهِ شَهِيداً بَيْنِي وَبَيْنَكُمْ إِنَّهُ كَانَ بِعِبَادِهِ خَبِيراً بَصِيراً,Say ‘God suffices as a witness between me and you of my sincerity. Truly He is Aware Seer of His servants’ Knower of what they hide and what they manifest.
وَمَن يَهْدِ ٱللَّهُ فَهُوَ ٱلْمُهْتَدِ وَمَن يُضْلِلْ فَلَن تَجِدَ لَهُمْ أَوْلِيَآءَ مِن دُونِهِ وَنَحْشُرُهُمْ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ عَلَىٰ وُجُوهِهِمْ عُمْياً وَبُكْماً وَصُمّاً مَّأْوَاهُمْ جَهَنَّمُ كُلَّمَا خَبَتْ زِدْنَاهُمْ سَعِيراً,And he whom God guides is rightly guided and he whom He sends astray — you will not find for them any guardians to guide them besides Him. And We shall assemble them on the Day of Resurrection walking on their faces blind dumb and deaf; their abode shall be Hell — whenever it abates whenever its flames subside We shall intensify for them the blaze the flame and its burning.
ذَلِكَ جَزَآؤُهُم بِأَنَّهُمْ كَفَرُواْ بِآيَاتِنَا وَقَالُواْ أَءِذَا كُنَّا عِظَاماً وَرُفَاتاً أَءِنَّا لَمَبْعُوثُونَ خَلْقاً جَدِيداً,That is their requital because they disbelieved Our signs and said in denial of the Resurrection ‘What when we are bones and fragments shall we really be raised in a new creation?’
أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْاْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ ٱلَّذِي خَلَقَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضَ قَادِرٌ عَلَىٰ أَن يَخْلُقَ مِثْلَهُمْ وَجَعَلَ لَهُمْ أَجَلاً لاَّ رَيْبَ فِيهِ فَأَبَىٰ ٱلظَّالِمُونَ إِلاَّ كُفُوراً,Have they not seen realised that God He Who created the heavens and the earth with all their immensity has the power to create the like of them? that is the like of these human beings especially given their smallness? He has appointed for them a term until the time for their death and resurrection whereof is no doubt; yet the wrongdoers insist on disbelief on denial of such a term.
قُل لَّوْ أَنْتُمْ تَمْلِكُونَ خَزَآئِنَ رَحْمَةِ رَبِّي إِذاً لأمْسَكْتُمْ خَشْيَةَ ٱلإِنْفَاقِ وَكَانَ ٱلإنْسَانُ قَتُوراً,Say to them ‘If you possessed the treasuries of my Lord’s mercy those treasuries of provision and rain you would surely withhold them you would stint for fear of spending fearing that they would be depleted if one spent from them and that you would then become impoverished; and man is ever niggardly’.
وَلَقَدْ آتَيْنَا مُوسَىٰ تِسْعَ آيَاتٍ بَيِّنَاتٍ فَسْئَلْ بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ إِذْ جَآءَهُمْ فَقَالَ لَهُ فِرْعَونُ إِنِّي لأَظُنُّكَ يٰمُوسَىٰ مَسْحُوراً,And verily We gave Moses nine manifest signs clear signs namely those of the hand the staff the flood the locusts the lice the frogs the blood and the obliteration of their possessions cf. Q. 1088 the years of dearth and scarcity of fruits cf. Q. 7130. Ask O Muhammad (s) the Children of Israel about this a rhetorical question meant as an affirmation for the idolaters of your sincerity; or it means that We said to him Muhammad (s) ‘Ask’; a variant reading has the past tense fa-sā’ala ‘and he asked’ when he came to them Pharaoh said to him ‘O Moses I truly think that you are bewitched’ duped your mind deceived.
قَالَ لَقَدْ عَلِمْتَ مَآ أَنزَلَ هَـٰؤُلاۤءِ إِلاَّ رَبُّ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ بَصَآئِرَ وَإِنِّي لأَظُنُّكَ يٰفِرْعَونُ مَثْبُوراً,He Moses said ‘Indeed you know that none revealed these signs except the Lord of the heavens and the earth as proofs lessons; however you are being stubborn a variant reading for ‘alimta ‘you know’ has ‘alimtu ‘I know’; and I truly think that you O Pharaoh are doomed’ that you will be destroyed — or it mathbūran means that Pharaoh has been turned away from all deeds that are good.
فَأَرَادَ أَن يَسْتَفِزَّهُم مِّنَ ٱلأَرْضِ فَأَغْرَقْنَاهُ وَمَن مَّعَهُ جَمِيعاً,And he Pharaoh desired to scare them to expel Moses and his people from the land the land of Egypt; so We drowned him and those with him all together.
وَقُلْنَا مِن بَعْدِهِ لِبَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ ٱسْكُنُواْ ٱلأَرْضَ فَإِذَا جَآءَ وَعْدُ ٱلآخِرَةِ جِئْنَا بِكُمْ لَفِيفاً,And after him We said to the Children of Israel ‘Dwell in the land; but when the promise of the Hereafter namely the Hour comes to pass We shall bring you gathered in mixed company’ all together you and them.
وَبِٱلْحَقِّ أَنْزَلْنَاهُ وَبِٱلْحَقِّ نَزَلَ وَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَاكَ إِلاَّ مُبَشِّراً وَنَذِيراً,With the truth have We revealed it that is the Qur’ān and with the truth it comprises has it been revealed in the way it has unaffected by any alterations; and We have not sent you O Muhammad (s) except as a bearer of good tidings of Paradise for those who believe and as a warner of the Fire for those who disbelieve.
وَقُرْآناً فَرَقْنَاهُ لِتَقْرَأَهُ عَلَى ٱلنَّاسِ عَلَىٰ مُكْثٍ وَنَزَّلْنَاهُ تَنْزِيلاً,And it is a Qur’ān qur’ānan is in the accusative because of the verb governing it which is the following that We have divided that We have revealed in portions over 20 or 23 years that you may recite it to mankind at intervals gradually and with deliberateness so that they are able to comprehend it and We have revealed it by successive revelation one part after another according to what is best for mankind.
قُلْ آمِنُواْ بِهِ أَوْ لاَ تُؤْمِنُوۤاْ إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ ٱلْعِلْمَ مِن قَبْلِهِ إِذَا يُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْهِمْ يَخِرُّونَ لِلأَذْقَانِ سُجَّداً,Say to the disbelievers of Mecca ‘Believe in it or do not believe as a threat to them; indeed those who were given knowledge before it before its revelation namely the believers from among the People of the Scripture when it is recited to them fall down in prostration on their faces
وَيَقُولُونَ سُبْحَانَ رَبِّنَآ إِن كَانَ وَعْدُ رَبِّنَا لَمَفْعُولاً,and say “Glory be to our Lord exalting Him above the claim that His promise of sending a prophet had not been fulfilled. Indeed in softened Our Lord’s promise of its the Qur’ān’s revelation and the sending of the Prophet s is bound to be fulfilled”.
وَيَخِرُّونَ لِلأَذْقَانِ يَبْكُونَ وَيَزِيدُهُمْ خُشُوعاً,And they fall down on their faces weeping yabkūna is a supplement to yakhirrūna ‘they fall down’ also containing an adjectival qualification of those falling down; and it the Qur’ān increases them in humility’ in humbleness before God.
قُلِ ٱدْعُواْ ٱللَّهَ أَوِ ٱدْعُواْ ٱلرَّحْمَـٰنَ أَيّاً مَّا تَدْعُواْ فَلَهُ ٱلأَسْمَآءَ ٱلْحُسْنَىٰ وَلاَ تَجْهَرْ بِصَلاَتِكَ وَلاَ تُخَافِتْ بِهَا وَٱبْتَغِ بَيْنَ ذٰلِكَ سَبِيلاً,The Prophet s would often say ‘O God O Compassionate One’. So they said ‘He Muhammad (s) forbids us to worship more than one god and yet he calls upon another god together with Him God’. The following was then revealed Say to them ‘Invoke God or invoke the Compassionate One that is to say invoke Him by either of these Names or call upon Him by saying ‘O God! O Compassionate One!’ whichever ayyan is conditional; mā is extra in other words whichever of these two Names you invoke is beautiful — this predicate ‘beautiful’ is indicated by the following statement to Him to the One called by these two Names belong the Most Beautiful Names’ these two Names being from among them; and they the other Names are the following as mentioned in hadīth God there is no god except Him the Compassionate the Merciful the King the Holy the Peace the Securer the Controller the Mighty the Compeller the Sublime the Creator the Maker out of nothing the Fashioner the ever Forgiving the Almighty the Bestower the Provider the Deliverer the Knower the Seizer the Extender the Lowerer the Raiser the Glorifier the Abaser the Hearer the Seer the Arbiter the Just the Subtle the Aware the Forbearing the Tremendous the Forgiver the Thankful the High the Great the Preserver the Conserver the Reckoner the Majestic the Generous the Watcher the Responsive the Embracing the Wise the Loving the Glorious the Resurrector the Witnessing the Truth the Guardian the Strong the Firm the Patron the Praiseworthy the Numberer the Initiator the Restorer the Life-giver the Death-maker the Living the Eternal Sustainer the Originator the Magnificent the One the Single the Everlasting Refuge the Powerful the Omnipotent the Advancer the Deferrer the First the Last the Outward the Inward the Ruler Exalted the Benign the Relenting the Avenger the Pardoning the Gentle Master of the Kingdom One of Majesty and Munificence the Equitable the Gatherer the Independent the Availing the Restrainer the Harming the Benefactor the Light the Guiding the Innovator the Enduring the Inheritor the Reasonable the Patient as reported by al-Tirmidhī. God exalted be He says And do not be loud in your prayer when you recite the Qur’ān therein lest the idolaters hear you and curse you as well as the Qur’ān and the One Who has revealed it; nor be silent do not murmur therein so that your companions might be able to hear it and benefit therefrom; but seek between that loudness and silence a middle way.
وَقُلِ ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ ٱلَّذِي لَمْ يَتَّخِذْ وَلَداً وَلَم يَكُنْ لَّهُ شَرِيكٌ فِي ٱلْمُلْكِ وَلَمْ يَكُنْ لَّهُ وَلِيٌّ مِّنَ ٱلذُّلِّ وَكَبِّرْهُ تَكْبِيراً,And say ‘Praise be to God Who has neither taken a son nor has He any partner in sovereignty in divineness nor has He taken any ally to assist Him out of because of any weakness’ that is to say He would never become weak and thus need an assistant. And magnify Him with magnifications worthy of Him extol Him with a perfect extolling above that He should have taken a son or a partner and above any weakness and above all that does not befit Him. The arrangement whereby ‘praise’ is invoked together with this statement is meant to indicate that He is the One worthy of all praise because of the perfection of His Essence and the fact that He alones possesses those attributes of His. Imam Ahmad b. Hanbal relates in his Musnad by way of a report from Mu‘ādh al-Juhanī who heard it from the Messenger of God s who used to say ‘The “glory” verse in the Qur’ān is Praise be to God Who has neither taken a son nor has He any partner in sovereignty … to the end of the above-mentioned sūra 17111’ and God exalted be He knows best. The author of this commentary says ‘This last commentary constitutes the end of my complement to the commentary on the Noble Qur’ān composed by the inquisitive scholar the shaykh Imam Jalāl al-Dīn al-Mahallī al-Shāfi‘ī may God be pleased with him. I have expended every effort in it and reflected throughout it exhaustively especially in those precious things that I have deemed God willing to be profitable. I composed it this commentary in the same length of time appointed for the one spoken to by God sc. Moses and I have made it a means to attaining the Gardens of Bliss. It this commentary actually draws on the work which it complements relying and depending on it for an understanding of those allegorical verses. May God have mercy on one who examines it with impartiality chances upon an error and informs me of it. As I have said “I praise God my Lord for He guided me in what I have expressed despite my incapacity and weakness; for who other than God is there to avert me from error and who is there to accept from me even a single letter”.
ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ ٱلَّذِي أَنْزَلَ عَلَىٰ عَبْدِهِ ٱلْكِتَابَ وَلَمْ يَجْعَل لَّهُ عِوَجَا,Praise — which is the attribution to a person of that which is beautiful — is established as something that belongs to God alone exalted be He. Now is the intention here to point this out for the purpose of believing in it or to praise God thereby or both? All are possibilities the most profitable of which is to understand the third as being the intention behind this statement; Who has revealed to His servant Muhammad (s) the Book the Qur’ān and has not allowed for it that is He has not allowed that there be in it any crookedness any variance or contradiction the last sentence wa-lam yaj‘al lahu ‘iwajan is a circumstantial qualifier referring to al-kitāb ‘the Book’;
قَيِّماً لِّيُنْذِرَ بَأْساً شَدِيداً مِّن لَّدُنْهُ وَيُبَشِّرَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ ٱلَّذِينَ يَعْمَلُونَ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ أَنَّ لَهُمْ أَجْراً حَسَناً,a Book upright qayyiman is a second circumstantial qualifier for added emphasis to warn of to make by this Book the disbelievers fear severe chastisement from Him from God and to bring to the believers who perform righteous deeds the good tidings that theirs will be a fair reward
مَّاكِثِينَ فِيهِ أَبَداً,wherein they will abide forever and this reward is Paradise;
وَيُنْذِرَ ٱلَّذِينَ قَالُواْ ٱتَّخَذَ ٱللَّهُ وَلَداً,and to warn those from among the disbelievers who say ‘God has taken a son’.
مَّا لَهُمْ بِهِ مِنْ عِلْمٍ وَلاَ لآبَائِهِمْ كَبُرَتْ كَلِمَةً تَخْرُجُ مِنْ أَفْوَاهِهِمْ إِن يَقُولُونَ إِلاَّ كَذِباً,They do not have in this in this saying any knowledge nor did their fathers before them who also used to say this. Dreadful grave is the word that comes out of their mouths kalimatan ‘word’ is for specification and it explains the unidentified feminine person of the verb kaburat ‘dreadful’; and that which is the object of censure has been omitted and that is their above-mentioned saying that God has taken a son. They speak nothing thereby but an utterance of lies.
فَلَعَلَّكَ بَاخِعٌ نَّفْسَكَ عَلَىٰ آثَارِهِمْ إِن لَّمْ يُؤْمِنُواْ بِهَـٰذَا ٱلْحَدِيثِ أَسَفاً,Yet it may be that you will consume destroy yourself in their wake — following your being with them that is after they have left you — if they should not believe in this discourse in this Qur’ān out of grief out of rage and anguish on your part because of your eagerness that they believe asafan ‘out of grief’ is in the accusative because it functions as an object denoting reason.
إِنَّا جَعَلْنَا مَا عَلَى ٱلأَرْضِ زِينَةً لَّهَا لِنَبْلُوَهُمْ أَيُّهُم أَحْسَنُ عَمَلاً,Truly We have made all that is on the earth in the way of animals plants trees rivers and so on as an adornment for it that We may try them that We may test mankind observing thereby which of them is best in conduct therein that is to see which of them is the most abstemious of it.
وَإِنَّا لَجَاعِلُونَ مَا عَلَيْهَا صَعِيداً جُرُزاً,And indeed We shall turn all that is therein into barren shreds that produce no plants.
أَمْ حَسِبْتَ أَنَّ أَصْحَابَ ٱلْكَهْفِ وَٱلرَّقِيمِ كَانُواْ مِنْ آيَاتِنَا عَجَباً,Or did you think did you suppose that the Companions of the Cave the cavern in the mountain and the Inscription the tablet wherein their names and lineages had been inscribed — the Prophet s had been asked about their tale — were with regard to their tale a unique marvel from among the entirety of Our signs? ‘ajaban ‘a marvel’ is the predicate of the defective verb kāna sc. kānū the preceding min āyātinā ‘from among Our signs’ being a circumstantial qualifier. In other words did you suppose that they were a marvel exclusively from among all Our other signs or that they were the most marvellous among them? Not so.
إِذْ أَوَى ٱلْفِتْيَةُ إِلَى ٱلْكَهْفِ فَقَالُواْ رَبَّنَآ آتِنَا مِن لَّدُنكَ رَحْمَةً وَهَيِّىءْ لَنَا مِنْ أَمْرِنَا رَشَداً,Mention when the youths took refuge in the Cave fitya ‘youths’ is the plural of fatā and denotes a mature young man fearing for their faith from their disbelieving people they said ‘Our Lord! Give us mercy from Yourself and remedy for us our affair through rectitude’ through Your guidance.
فَضَرَبْنَا عَلَىٰ آذَانِهِمْ فِي ٱلْكَهْفِ سِنِينَ عَدَداً,So We smote their ears that is We made them sleep in the Cave for several years for a fixed number of years.
ثُمَّ بَعَثْنَاهُمْ لِنَعْلَمَ أَيُّ الحِزْبَيْنِ أَحْصَىٰ لِمَا لَبِثُواْ أَمَداً,Then We aroused them We awakened them that We might know a knowledge of direct vision which of the two parties the two groups in disagreement over the length of their stay in the cave was better in calculating ahsā is of the pattern of af‘al meaning ‘more precise’ what they had tarried li-mā labithū is semantically connected to the following in terms of the length of time amadan in the accusative denotes purpose.
نَحْنُ نَقُصُّ عَلَيْكَ نبَأَهُم بِٱلْحَقِّ إِنَّهُمْ فِتْيَةٌ آمَنُواْ بِرَبِّهِمْ وَزِدْنَاهُمْ هُدًى,We relate recite to you their story with truth that is truthfully. They were indeed youths who believed in their Lord and We increased them in guidance.
وَرَبَطْنَا عَلَىٰ قُلُوبِهِمْ إِذْ قَامُواْ فَقَالُواْ رَبُّنَا رَبُّ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ لَن نَّدْعُوَاْ مِن دُونِهِ إِلـٰهاً لَّقَدْ قُلْنَا إِذاً شَطَطاً,And We strengthened their hearts to enable them to speak the truth when they stood up before their king who had commanded them to prostrate to idols and said ‘Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth. We will not call on any god besides Him that is other than Him for then we shall certainly have uttered an outrage in other words we shall have spoken a statement that contains shatat meaning one of extreme disbelief were we hypothetically to call on any god other than God.
هَـٰؤُلاۤءِ قَوْمُنَا ٱتَّخَذُواْ مِن دُونِهِ آلِهَةً لَّوْلاَ يَأْتُونَ عَلَيْهِم بِسُلْطَانٍ بَيِّنٍ فَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّنِ ٱفْتَرَىٰ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ كَذِباً,These hā’ūlā’ is the subject of the sentence our people qawmunā is an explicative supplement to the subject have taken gods besides Him. Why if what they claim is true do they not bring some clear warrant some manifest argument regarding them? regarding worship of these idols. And who does greater wrong — in other words no one does greater wrong — than he who invents a lie against God? by ascribing partners to Him exalted be He. Some among the youths said to the others
وَإِذِ ٱعْتَزَلْتُمُوهُمْ وَمَا يَعْبُدُونَ إِلاَّ ٱللَّهَ فَأْوُوا إِلَى ٱلْكَهْفِ يَنْشُرْ لَكُمْ رَبُّكُم مِّن رَّحْمَتِهِ وَيُهَيِّئْ لَكُمْ مِّنْ أَمْرِكُمْ مِّرْفَقاً,And when you withdraw from them and from that which they worship except God then take refuge in the Cave. Your Lord will reveal for you something of His mercy and prepare for you in your affair some comfort’ read mirfaqan or marfiqan that is to say something for you to find comfort in in the way of lunch or supper.
وَتَرَى ٱلشَّمْسَ إِذَا طَلَعَت تَّزَاوَرُ عَن كَهْفِهِمْ ذَاتَ ٱلْيَمِينِ وَإِذَا غَرَبَت تَّقْرِضُهُمْ ذَاتَ ٱلشِّمَالِ وَهُمْ فِي فَجْوَةٍ مِّنْهُ ذٰلِكَ مِنْ آيَاتِ ٱللَّهِ مَن يَهْدِ ٱللَّهُ فَهُوَ ٱلْمُهْتَدِ وَمَن يُضْلِلْ فَلَن تَجِدَ لَهُ وَلِيّاً مُّرْشِداً,And you might have seen the sun when it rose inclining read tazzāwaru or tazāwaru away from their Cave towards the right side of it and when it set go past them on the left avoid them and pass over them so that it does not fall on them at all while they were in a cavern therein in an ample space inside the Cave where the coolness and the gentle breeze of the winds reached them. That which is mentioned was one of God’s signs one of the proofs of His power. Whomever God guides he indeed is rightly guided and whomever He leads astray you will not find for him a guiding friend.
وَتَحْسَبُهُمْ أَيْقَاظاً وَهُمْ رُقُودٌ وَنُقَلِّبُهُمْ ذَاتَ ٱليَمِينِ وَذَاتَ ٱلشِّمَالِ وَكَلْبُهُمْ بَاسِطٌ ذِرَاعَيْهِ بِٱلوَصِيدِ لَوِ ٱطَّلَعْتَ عَلَيْهِمْ لَوَلَّيْتَ مِنْهُمْ فِرَاراً وَلَمُلِئْتَ مِنْهُمْ رُعْباً,And you would have supposed them — had you seen them — awake that is conscious because their eyes were open ayqāz ‘awake’ is the plural of yaqiz though they were asleep ruqūd is the plural of rāqid. And We caused them to turn over to the right and to the left lest the earth consume their flesh and their dog lay stretching its forelegs his paws on the threshold at the opening of the cave whenever they turned over it would turn over just like them both during sleep and consciousness. If you had observed them you would have turned away from them in flight and you would have been filled read la-mulli’ta or la-muli’ta with awe because of them read ru‘ban or ru‘uban ‘awe’ it was through this awe that God protected them from anyone entering upon them.
وَكَذٰلِكَ بَعَثْنَاهُمْ لِيَتَسَآءَلُوا بَيْنَهُمْ قَالَ قَائِلٌ مِّنْهُمْ كَم لَبِثْتُمْ قَالُواْ لَبِثْنَا يَوْماً أَوْ بَعْضَ يَوْمٍ قَالُواْ رَبُّكُمْ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا لَبِثْتُمْ فَٱبْعَثُواْ أَحَدَكُمْ بِوَرِقِكُمْ هَـٰذِهِ إِلَىٰ ٱلْمَدِينَةِ فَلْيَنْظُرْ أَيُّهَآ أَزْكَىٰ طَعَاماً فَلْيَأْتِكُمْ بِرِزْقٍ مِّنْهُ وَلْيَتَلَطَّفْ وَلاَ يُشْعِرَنَّ بِكُمْ أَحَداً,And so just as We did with them that which We have mentioned it was that We aroused them We awakened them that they might question one another concerning their state and the length of their stay in the cave. One of them said ‘How long have you tarried?’ They said ‘We have tarried a day or part of a day’ he said this because they had entered the cave at sunrise and were awakened at sunset and so they thought that it was the time of sunset on the day of their entry. Then they said unsure about this fact ‘Your Lord knows best how long you have tarried. Now send one of you with this silver coin of yours read bi-warqikum or bi-wariqikum to the city — which is said to be the one now called Tarsus Tarasūs — and let him see which is the purest food that is which of the foods of the city is the purest and let him bring you a supply thereof. Let him be careful and not make anyone aware of you.
إِنَّهُمْ إِن يَظْهَرُواْ عَلَيْكُمْ يَرْجُمُوكُمْ أَوْ يُعِيدُوكُمْ فِي مِلَّتِهِمْ وَلَن تُفْلِحُوۤاْ إِذاً أَبَداً,For indeed if they should come to know of you they will either stone you kill you by stoning or make you return to their creed and then if you do return to their creed you will never prosper’.
وَكَذٰلِكَ أَعْثَرْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ لِيَعْلَمُوۤاْ أَنَّ وَعْدَ ٱللَّهِ حَقٌّ وَأَنَّ ٱلسَّاعَةَ لاَ رَيْبَ فِيهَا إِذْ يَتَنَازَعُونَ بَيْنَهُمْ أَمْرَهُمْ فَقَالُواْ ٱبْنُواْ عَلَيْهِمْ بُنْيَاناً رَّبُّهُمْ أَعْلَمُ بِهِمْ قَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ غَلَبُواْ عَلَىٰ أَمْرِهِمْ لَنَتَّخِذَنَّ عَلَيْهِمْ مَّسْجِداً,And so just as We aroused them it was that We disclosed them to their people and the believers that they that is their people might know that God’s promise of resurrection is true by virtue of the fact that One Who has the power to make them sleep for such a long period of time or sustain them in that state without nourishment also has the power to resurrect the dead; and that as for the Hour there is no doubt no uncertainty concerning it. Behold idh adverbially qualifies a‘tharnā ‘We disclosed’ they were disputing that is the believers and the disbelievers among themselves their affair the affair of the youths with regard to building something around them as a monument; so they the disbelievers said ‘Build over them that is around them a building to cover them up; their Lord knows them best.’ Those who prevailed regarding their affair the affair of the youths namely the believers ‘We will verily set up over them around them a place of worship’ for prayers to be performed therein. And this indeed took place at the entrance of the cave.
سَيَقُولُونَ ثَلاثَةٌ رَّابِعُهُمْ كَلْبُهُمْ وَيَقُولُونَ خَمْسَةٌ سَادِسُهُمْ كَلْبُهُمْ رَجْماً بِٱلْغَيْبِ وَيَقُولُونَ سَبْعَةٌ وَثَامِنُهُمْ كَلْبُهُمْ قُل رَّبِّي أَعْلَمُ بِعِدَّتِهِم مَّا يَعْلَمُهُمْ إِلاَّ قَلِيلٌ فَلاَ تُمَارِ فِيهِمْ إِلاَّ مِرَآءً ظَاهِراً وَلاَ تَسْتَفْتِ فِيهِمْ مِّنْهُمْ أَحَداً,They will say that is some of those disputing the number of the youths of the cave at the time of the Prophet s in other words some of these will say that they the youths were ‘Three; their dog the fourth of them’; and they some others among them will say ‘Five; their dog the sixth of them’ — both of these sayings were those of the Christians of Najrān — guessing at random in other words out of supposition not having been present with them at the time and this statement ‘guessing at random’ refers back to both sayings and is in the accusative because it is an object denoting reason in other words they said this for the reason that they were merely supposing it. And they that is the believers will say ‘Seven; and their dog the eighth of them’ the sentence is part of the subject clause the predicate of which is the adjectival qualification of sab‘a ‘seven’ namely thāminuhum ‘the eighth of them’ with the additional wāw wa-thāminuhum which is said to be for emphasis or an indication that the adjective is semantically attached to that which it is qualifying. The qualification of the first two sayings as being ‘random’ but not the third is proof that the latter is the satisfactory and correct number. Say ‘My Lord knows best their number and none knows them except a few’ Ibn ‘Abbās said ‘I am one of these “few” described’ and he mentioned that they were seven. So do not contend concerning them except with an outward manner of contention except with that which has been revealed to you and do not question concerning them do not ask for opinions from any of them from the People of the Scripture the Jews. The people of Mecca asked him the Prophet about the story of the People of the Cave and so he said to them ‘I will tell you about it tomorrow’ but without adding the words ‘If God wills’ inshā’a’ Llāhu and so the following was revealed
وَلاَ تَقُولَنَّ لِشَاْىءٍ إِنِّي فَاعِلٌ ذٰلِكَ غَداً,And never say regarding something that is for the purpose of doing something ‘I will indeed do that tomorrow’ in other words I will do something at some future point in time
إِلاَّ أَن يَشَآءَ ٱللَّهُ وَٱذْكُر رَّبَّكَ إِذَا نَسِيتَ وَقُلْ عَسَىٰ أَن يَهْدِيَنِ رَبِّي لأَقْرَبَ مِنْ هَـٰذَا رَشَداً,without adding ‘If God will’ in other words unless firmly adhering to the will of God exalted be He by saying ‘If God will’ inshā’a’Llāh. And remember your Lord that is remember His will making things conditional on it if you forget to make things conditional on it mentioning it after forgetting it is the equal in validity to mentioning it at the time of the statement — as al-Hasan al-Basrī and others have said — as long as the person is still in the same place in which he made the statement. And say ‘May be my Lord will guide me to something closer in time than this closer than the story of the People of the Cave as an indication of the truth of my prophethood by way of guidance and God indeed did so.
وَلَبِثُواْ فِي كَهْفِهِمْ ثَلاثَ مِاْئَةٍ سِنِينَ وَٱزْدَادُواْ تِسْعاً,And they tarried in the Cave three hundred read with tanwīn thalāthami’atin years sinīn is an explicative supplement to thalāthami’atin ‘three hundred’ these three hundred years in the case of the People of the Cave were solar years; but for the number of lunar ones the Arabs add nine years thereto and this is mentioned in His saying and add nine that is nine years; in other words three hundred solar years while three hundred and nine lunar ones.
قُلِ ٱللَّهُ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا لَبِثُواْ لَهُ غَيْبُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ أَبْصِرْ بِهِ وَأَسْمِعْ مَا لَهُم مِّن دُونِهِ مِن وَلِيٍّ وَلاَ يُشْرِكُ فِي حُكْمِهِ أَحَداً,Say ‘God is more knowledgeable of how long they tarried more knowledgeable than those contending over this issue — and this fact has already been mentioned above verse 19. To Him belongs the Unseen of the heavens and the earth that is to Him belongs the knowledge thereof. How well He sees! namely God — this form is for expressing amazement at something. How well He hears! likewise for expressing amazement. These two expressions are being used metaphorically. What is meant is that nothing can escape God’s sight or hearing. They the inhabitants of the heavens and the earth have no guardian someone to assist them besides Him and He makes none to share in His rule’ for He is Independent without need of a partner.
وَٱتْلُ مَآ أُوْحِيَ إِلَيْكَ مِن كِتَابِ رَبِّكَ لاَ مُبَدِّلَ لِكَلِمَاتِهِ وَلَن تَجِدَ مِن دُونِهِ مُلْتَحَداً,And recite that which has been revealed to you of the Book of your Lord. There is none who can change His words. And you will not find besides Him any refuge.
وَٱصْبِرْ نَفْسَكَ مَعَ ٱلَّذِينَ يَدْعُونَ رَبَّهُم بِٱلْغَدَاةِ وَٱلْعَشِيِّ يُرِيدُونَ وَجْهَهُ وَلاَ تَعْدُ عَيْنَاكَ عَنْهُمْ تُرِيدُ زِينَةَ ٱلْحَيَاةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَلاَ تُطِعْ مَنْ أَغْفَلْنَا قَلْبَهُ عَن ذِكْرِنَا وَٱتَّبَعَ هَوَاهُ وَكَانَ أَمْرُهُ فُرُطاً,And restrain yourself detain yourself along with those who call upon their Lord at morning and evening desiring through their worship His Countenance exalted be He and not any of the transient things of this world — and these are the poor; and do not let your eyes overlook turn away from them — these the eyes are being used to refer to the person addressed — desiring the glitter of the life of this world. And do not obey him whose heart We have made oblivious to Our remembrance that is to the Qur’ān — this was ‘Uyayna b. Hisn and his companions — and who follows his own whim by attributing partners to God and whose conduct is mere prodigality excess.
وَقُلِ ٱلْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّكُمْ فَمَن شَآءَ فَلْيُؤْمِن وَمَن شَآءَ فَلْيَكْفُرْ إِنَّا أَعْتَدْنَا لِلظَّالِمِينَ نَاراً أَحَاطَ بِهِمْ سُرَادِقُهَا وَإِن يَسْتَغِيثُواْ يُغَاثُواْ بِمَآءٍ كَٱلْمُهْلِ يَشْوِي ٱلْوجُوهَ بِئْسَ ٱلشَّرَابُ وَسَآءَتْ مُرْتَفَقاً,And say to him and to his companions that this Qur’ān is ‘The truth that comes from your Lord; so whoever will let him believe and whoever will let him disbelieve’ — this is meant as a threat to them. Indeed We have prepared for the wrongdoers that is the disbelievers a Fire and they will be surrounded by its pavilion by that which encloses the Fire itself. If they cry out for help they will be succoured with water like molten copper like thick burning oil which scalds faces because of the intensity of its heat if it is brought near them. What an evil drink that is and how ill is the Fire as a resting-place! murtafaqan is a specification derived from the agent of the verb in other words vile is the person choosing to rest thereon; and this is in contrast to what He will say next about Paradise How fair a resting-place below verse 31. For indeed what resting-place can there be in the Fire?
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ إِنَّا لاَ نُضِيعُ أَجْرَ مَنْ أَحْسَنَ عَمَلاً,Truly those who believe and perform righteous deeds — indeed We do not leave the reward of those of good deeds to go to waste this last sentence is the predicate of the previous inna’lladhīna ‘truly those who’ and in it an overt identification of the recipients of the reward has replaced the would-be pronominalisation in other words it is ‘their reward’ which shall not be left to go to waste and We will reward them with what it the reward of good-doers comprises.
أُوْلَـٰئِكَ لَهُمْ جَنَّاتُ عَدْنٍ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهِمُ ٱلأَنْهَارُ يُحَلَّوْنَ فِيهَا مِنْ أَسَاوِرَ مِن ذَهَبٍ وَيَلْبَسُونَ ثِيَاباً خُضْراً مِّن سُنْدُسٍ وَإِسْتَبْرَقٍ مُّتَّكِئِينَ فِيهَا عَلَى ٱلأَرَآئِكِ نِعْمَ ٱلثَّوَابُ وَحَسُنَتْ مُرْتَفَقاً,Those for them there shall be Gardens of Eden as a place of residence underneath which rivers flow; therein they shall be adorned with bracelets of gold min asāwir it is said that min here is either extra or partitive; it asāwir is the plural of aswira — similar in pattern to ahmira for himār — which is the plural of siwār and they shall wear green garments of fine silk sundus and heavy silk brocade istabraq is that silk which is coarse God says in the verse of sūrat al-Rahmān Q. 5554 lined with heavy silk brocade; reclining therein on couches arā’ik is the plural of arīka which is a bed inside a curtained canopy and is also a tent adorned with garments and curtains for a bride. How excellent a reward a requital is Paradise and how fair a resting-place!
وَٱضْرِبْ لهُمْ مَّثَلاً رَّجُلَيْنِ جَعَلْنَا لأَحَدِهِمَا جَنَّتَيْنِ مِنْ أَعْنَابٍ وَحَفَفْنَاهُمَا بِنَخْلٍ وَجَعَلْنَا بَيْنَهُمَا زَرْعاً,And strike coin for them for the disbelievers together with the believers a similitude two men rajulayn is a substitute for mathalan ‘a similitude’ and constitutes together with what follows an explanation of the similitude to one of whom the disbeliever We had assigned two gardens orchards of vines and We had surrounded them with date-palms and had set between them a field of crops from which he acquired his food supplies.
كِلْتَا ٱلْجَنَّتَيْنِ آتَتْ أُكُلَهَا وَلَمْ تَظْلِم مِّنْهُ شَيْئاً وَفَجَّرْنَا خِلالَهُمَا نَهَراً,Each of the two gardens kiltā ‘each of the two’ is a singular noun that indicates a dual number; and the entire clause is the subject yielded ātat is the predicate thereof its produce its fruit without stinting diminishing anything thereof. And We caused a stream to gush forth therein to run through them.
وَكَانَ لَهُ ثَمَرٌ فَقَالَ لِصَاحِبِهِ وَهُوَ يُحَاوِرُهُ أَنَا أَكْثَرُ مِنكَ مَالاً وَأَعَزُّ نَفَراً,And he had together with his two gardens fruit read thamar thumur or thumr all of which constitute the plural of thamra sing. ‘a fruit’ similar in pattern to shajara pl. shajar khashaba pl. khushb or badana pl. budn and he said to his companion the believer as he conversed with him boasting before him ‘I have more wealth than you and am stronger in respect of men’ in respect of clansmen.
وَدَخَلَ جَنَّتَهُ وَهُوَ ظَالِمٌ لِّنَفْسِهِ قَالَ مَآ أَظُنُّ أَن تَبِيدَ هَـٰذِهِ أَبَداً,And he entered his garden taking with him his companion accompanying him all around it showing him its fruits — God does not say here his ‘two gardens’ because what is meant is the beautiful part of the garden rawda; or because to mention just one suffices — having wronged himself through his disbelief. He said ‘I do not think that all this will ever perish become non-existent.
وَمَآ أَظُنُّ ٱلسَّاعَةَ قَائِمَةً وَلَئِن رُّدِدتُّ إِلَىٰ رَبِّي لأَجِدَنَّ خَيْراً مِّنْهَا مُنْقَلَباً,Moreover I do not think that the Hour will ever come; and even if I am indeed returned to my Lord in the Hereafter according to your claim I shall surely find better than this as a resort’ as a place of return.
قَالَ لَهُ صَاحِبُهُ وَهُوَ يُحَاوِرُهُ أَكَفَرْتَ بِٱلَّذِي خَلَقَكَ مِن تُرَابٍ ثُمَّ مِن نُّطْفَةٍ ثُمَّ سَوَّاكَ رَجُلاً,His companion said to him as he conversed with him responding to him ‘Do you disbelieve in Him Who created you of dust — as Adam was created of it — then of a drop of fluid of semen then fashioned you made you upright and gave you the form of a man?
لَّٰكِنَّاْ هُوَ ٱللَّهُ رَبِّي وَلاَ أُشْرِكُ بِرَبِّي أَحَداً,But lo lākinnā is actually made up of lākin anā ‘but I … ’ where the hamza vowel has either been transferred onto the nūn of lākin or omitted altogether with the nūn assimilated with the like of it He is huwa this is the pronoun of the subject matter to be stated and is clarified by the sentence that follows it the meaning in other words is ‘But it is that I say that He is’ God my Lord and I do not ascribe any partner to my Lord.
وَلَوْلاۤ إِذْ دَخَلْتَ جَنَّتَكَ قُلْتَ مَا شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ لاَ قُوَّةَ إِلاَّ بِٱللَّهِ إِن تَرَنِ أَنَاْ أَقَلَّ مِنكَ مَالاً وَوَلَداً,And if only when you entered your garden you had said upon admiring it ‘This is “What God has willed. There is no power except in God”. In a hadīth it is stated that ‘Whoever is given something good in the way of family or wealth and upon receiving it says “What God wills comes to pass; there is no power except in God” mā shā’a’Llāh lā quwwata illā bi’Llāh he will never experience any ill therefrom’. If you see me anā is a pronoun separating two direct objects as less than you in wealth and children
فعسَىٰ رَبِّي أَن يُؤْتِيَنِ خَيْراً مِّن جَنَّتِكَ وَيُرْسِلَ عَلَيْهَا حُسْبَاناً مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ فَتُصْبِحَ صَعِيداً زَلَقاً,maybe my Lord will give me something better than your garden this is the response to the conditional clause beginning with lawlā ‘and if only’ and unleash upon it bolts husbān is the plural of husbāna that is to say thunderbolts from the heaven so that it becomes a bare plain a piece of smooth ground upon which no foot can stand firm;
أَوْ يُصْبِحَ مَآؤُهَا غَوْراً فَلَن تَسْتَطِيعَ لَهُ طَلَباً,or maybe its water will sink deep down ghawran functions in meaning like ghā’iran and it constitutes a supplement to yursila ‘He will unleash’ but not a supplement to tusbiha ‘it becomes’ because the sinking of water deep into the earth does not necessarily result from thunderbolts so that you have no means of acquiring it’ no possible way of reaching it.
وَأُحِيطَ بِثَمَرِهِ فَأَصْبَحَ يُقَلِّبُ كَفَّيْهِ عَلَى مَآ أَنْفَقَ فِيهَا وَهِيَ خَاوِيَةٌ عَلَىٰ عُرُوشِهَا وَيَقُولُ يٰلَيْتَنِي لَمْ أُشْرِكْ بِرَبِّي أَحَداً,And his fruit was beset through the curbing measures mentioned above it was beset together with his garden by destruction and were thus ruined and so he began to wring his hands out of regret and anguish because of what he had spent on it on the cultivation of his garden as it lay fallen having collapsed on its trellises those supporting the vines so that first these collapsed and then the vine-grapes collapsed after them saying ‘O yā is for exclamation I wish I had not ascribed any partner to my Lord!’
وَلَمْ تَكُن لَّهُ فِئَةٌ يَنصُرُونَهُ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ وَمَا كَانَ مُنْتَصِراً,But there was no read takun or yakun party no persons to help him besides God at the moment of its destruction nor could he help himself at the moment of its destruction all by himself.
هُنَالِكَ ٱلْوَلاَيَةُ لِلَّهِ ٱلْحَقِّ هُوَ خَيْرٌ ثَوَاباً وَخَيْرٌ عُقْباً,There that is on the Day of Resurrection all protection walāya; if read wilāya then it means ‘sovereignty’ belongs to God the True if read as al-haqqu then it is as an adjective qualifying walāya or wilāya or if read as al-haqqi then it is an attribute of God’s Majesty. He is better at rewarding than the rewarding of any person other than Him if such a person were in a position to reward; and best in consequence read ‘uquban or ‘uqban He is best in terms of the consequence for believers both thawāban ‘rewarding’ and ‘uqban ‘consequence’ are in the accusative for the purpose of specification.
وَٱضْرِبْ لَهُم مَّثَلَ ٱلْحَيَاةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا كَمَآءٍ أَنْزَلْنَاهُ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَاءِ فَٱخْتَلَطَ بِهِ نَبَاتُ ٱلأَرْضِ فَأَصْبَحَ هَشِيماً تَذْرُوهُ ٱلرِّياحُ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ مُّقْتَدِراً,And strike draw for them your people the similitude of the life of this world mathala’l-hayāti’l-dunyā constitutes the first direct object as water ka-mā’in the second direct object which We send down out from the heaven and the vegetation of the earth mingles with it the vegetation multiplies by the sending down of the water; or it is that the water mixes with the vegetation such that it is nourished and flourishes; and it then becomes the vegetation becomes chaff dried up its various parts broken up in fragments scattered strewn and dispersed by the winds which then blow it away. The import is the life of this world is likened to flourishing vegetation which then becomes dry is broken up and scattered by the winds a variant reading for riyāh ‘winds’ has rīh. And God is Omnipotent Powerful over all things.
ٱلْمَالُ وَٱلْبَنُونَ زِينَةُ ٱلْحَيَاةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَٱلْبَاقِيَاتُ ٱلصَّالِحَاتُ خَيْرٌ عِندَ رَبِّكَ ثَوَاباً وَخَيْرٌ أَمَلاً,Wealth and children are an adornment of the life of this world adornment with which one arrays oneself therein. But the enduring things the righteous deeds — and these are ‘Glory be to God’ subhāna’Llāh ‘Praise be to God’ al-hāmdu li’Llāh ‘There is no god but God lā ilāha illā’Llāh ‘God is Great’ Allāhu akbar; some add the following ‘There is no power or strength except in God’ lā hawla wa-lā quwwata illā bi’Llāh — these are better with your Lord for reward and better in respect of hope in other words they are better in terms of what a person hopes for and desires from God exalted be He.
وَيَوْمَ نُسَيِّرُ ٱلْجِبَالَ وَتَرَى ٱلأَرْضَ بَارِزَةً وَحَشَرْنَاهُمْ فَلَمْ نُغَادِرْ مِنْهُمْ أَحَداً,And mention the day when the mountains shall be set in motion — they shall be removed from the face of the earth and become ‘as scattered dust’ Q. 566 a variant reading for tusayyaru’l-jibālu has nusayyiru’l-jibāla ‘We shall set the mountains in motion’ and you will see the earth exposed manifest in full view with no mountain or anything else on top of it. And We shall gather them believers and disbelievers such that We will not leave out anyone of them.
وَعُرِضُواْ عَلَىٰ رَبِّكَ صَفَّاً لَّقَدْ جِئْتُمُونَا كَمَا خَلَقْنَاكُمْ أَوَّلَ مَرَّةٍ بَلْ زَعَمْتُمْ أَلَّن نَّجْعَلَ لَكُمْ مَّوْعِداً,And they shall be presented before your Lord in ranks saffan is a circumstantial qualifier in other words ranged so that every community is in a row on its own and it shall be said to them ‘Verily you have come to Us just as We created you the first time that is to say individually barefoot naked and uncircumcised; and it shall be said to the deniers of the Resurrection rather you claimed that a of allan is an softened in place of the hardened one in other words it is to be understood as annahu We would not appoint for you a tryst’ for resurrection.
وَوُضِعَ ٱلْكِتَابُ فَتَرَى ٱلْمُجْرِمِينَ مُشْفِقِينَ مِمَّا فِيهِ وَيَقُولُونَ يٰوَيْلَتَنَا مَالِ هَـٰذَا ٱلْكِتَابِ لاَ يُغَادِرُ صَغِيرَةً وَلاَ كَبِيرَةً إِلاَّ أَحْصَاهَا وَوَجَدُواْ مَا عَمِلُواْ حَاضِراً وَلاَ يَظْلِمُ رَبُّكَ أَحَداً,And the Book shall be set in place the Book of every man — in his right hand if he is from among the believers and in his left hand if he is from among the disbelievers. And you will see the guilty the disbelievers apprehensive fearful of what is in it and they will say when they observe the evil deeds recorded in it ‘O yā is for exclamation woe to us! O this is our destruction! this form waylatanā is a verbal noun but in this form it cannot be conjugated as a verb What is it with this Book that it leaves out neither small nor great from among our sins but instead it has counted it?’ enumerated it and fixed it in the record — they are stupefied by it in this respect. And they shall find all that they did present fixed in writing in their individual Book. And your Lord does not wrong anyone He does not punish him if he is without guilt nor does He diminish anything of the reward of a believer.
وَإِذْ قُلْنَا لِلْمَلاۤئِكَةِ ٱسْجُدُواْ لأَدَمَ فَسَجَدُوۤاْ إِلاَّ إِبْلِيسَ كَانَ مِنَ ٱلْجِنِّ فَفَسَقَ عَنْ أَمْرِ رَبِّهِ أَفَتَتَّخِذُونَهُ وَذُرِّيَّتَهُ أَوْلِيَآءَ مِن دُونِي وَهُمْ لَكُمْ عَدُوٌّ بِئْسَ لِلظَّالِمِينَ بَدَلاً,And when idh is dependent because it is governed by an implicit udhkur ‘mention when’ We said to the angels ‘Prostrate before Adam’ a prostration involving a bow not placing one’s forehead down to the ground as a greeting to him; and so they prostrated all except Iblīs. He was one of the jinn — some say that these creatures are a species of angels in which case the exceptive clause illā Iblīs ‘except Iblīs’ is a continuous one; but it is also said to be discontinuous since Iblīs is considered the progenitor of all the jinn having offspring who are mentioned alongside him further below; angels on the other hand do not have offspring; and he transgressed against his Lord’s command that is to say he rebelled against obedience to Him by refraining from performing the prostration. Will you then take him and his offspring — this address is to Adam and his progeny the final pronominal suffix hā’ in both words refers to Iblīs for your patrons instead of Me obeying them when they are an enemy to you? in other words when they are your enemies wa-hum lakum ‘aduwwun is a circumstantial qualifier. How evil for the evildoers is that substitute! of Iblīs and his offspring in obeying them instead of obeying God.
مَّآ أَشْهَدتُّهُمْ خَلْقَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَلاَ خَلْقَ أَنْفُسِهِمْ وَمَا كُنتُ مُتَّخِذَ ٱلْمُضِلِّينَ عَضُداً,I did not make them a witness that is Iblīs and his offspring to the creation of the heavens and the earth nor to their own creation that is to say I did not make any of them present at the moment of the creation of the other. Nor do I take misleaders devils as My support as assistants in the process of creation so why do you obey them?
وَيَوْمَ يَقُولُ نَادُواْ شُرَكَآئِيَ ٱلَّذِينَ زَعَمْتُمْ فَدَعَوْهُمْ فَلَمْ يَسْتَجِيبُواْ لَهُمْ وَجَعَلْنَا بَيْنَهُم مَّوْبِقاً,And the day yawma is in the accusative because it is governed by the implicit udhkur ‘mention’ when He will say yaqūl or it may be read as naqūl ‘We will say’ ‘Call those partners of Mine those graven images as you used to claim’ let them intercede for you in the way you used to claim; and then they will call them but they will not respond to their call they will not answer them and We shall set between them between the graven images and those who worship them a gulf of doom — a valley from among the valleys of Hell in which they shall all be destroyed the term mawbiq derives from the verb wabaqa meaning halaka ‘he was destroyed’.
وَرَأَى ٱلْمُجْرِمُونَ ٱلنَّارَ فَظَنُّوۤاْ أَنَّهُمْ مُّوَاقِعُوهَا وَلَمْ يَجِدُواْ عَنْهَا مَصْرِفاً,And the criminals will behold the Fire and realise that are certain that they are about to fall into it. And they will find no means of avoiding it of circumventing it.
وَلَقَدْ صَرَّفْنَا فِي هَـٰذَا ٱلْقُرْآنِ لِلنَّاسِ مِن كُلِّ مَثَلٍ وَكَانَ ٱلإِنْسَانُ أَكْثَرَ شَيْءٍ جَدَلاً,And verily We have dispensed We have explained for mankind in this Qur’ān an example of every kind of similitude min kulli mathalin is an adjective qualifying an omitted clause in other words ‘We have dispensed therein a similitude from every kind of similitude that they may be admonished. But man is most disputatious he is most contentious in matters of falsehood jadalan is a specification derived from al-insān ‘man’ the subject of kāna in other words the meaning is that the disputatiousness of man is what can be found in him most.
وَمَا مَنَعَ ٱلنَّاسَ أَن يُؤْمِنُوۤاْ إِذْ جَآءَهُمُ ٱلْهُدَىٰ وَيَسْتَغْفِرُواْ رَبَّهُمْ إِلاَّ أَن تَأْتِيَهُمْ سُنَّةُ ٱلأَوَّلِينَ أَوْ يَأْتِيَهُمُ ٱلْعَذَابُ قُبُلاً,And nothing prevented people that is the disbelievers of Mecca from believing an yu’minū is after al-nāsa ‘people’ constitutes the second direct object clause when the guidance the Qur’ān came to them and from asking forgiveness of their Lord without that there should come upon them the precedent of the ancients sunnatu’l-awwalīn constitutes the subject of the verb that is to say Our precedent of dealing with them which is the destruction decreed for them or that the chastisement should come upon them before their very eyes in front of them and for them to see — which was their being killed on the day of Badr a variant reading for qibalan has qubulan which in the accusative is the plural of qabīlin meaning ‘of various kinds’.
وَمَا نُرْسِلُ ٱلْمُرْسَلِينَ إِلاَّ مُبَشِّرِينَ وَمُنذِرِينَ وَيُجَٰدِلُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ بِٱلْبَٰطِلِ لِيُدْحِضُواْ بِهِ ٱلْحَقَّ وَٱتَّخَذُوۤاْ ءَايَٰتِي وَمَآ أُنْذِرُواْ هُزُواً,And We do not send messengers except as bearers of good tidings to believers and as warners as threateners to disbelievers. But those who disbelieve dispute with falsehood when they say that ‘Has God sent a human as a messenger from Him?’ Q. 1794 and the like of such statements that they may refute thereby that by way of their disputing they may invalidate the truth the Qur’ān. And they have taken My signs namely the Qur’ān and that whereof they have been warned in the way of the Fire derisively in mockery.
وَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّن ذُكِّرَ بِآيَٰتِ رَبِّهِ فَأَعْرَضَ عَنْهَا وَنَسِيَ مَا قَدَّمَتْ يَدَاهُ إِنَّا جَعَلْنَا عَلَىٰ قُلُوبِهِمْ أَكِنَّةً أَن يَفْقَهُوهُ وَفِي ءَاذَانِهِمْ وَقْراً وَإِن تَدْعُهُمْ إِلَىٰ ٱلْهُدَىٰ فَلَنْ يَهْتَدُوۤاْ إِذاً أَبَداً,And who does greater wrong than he who has been reminded of the signs of his Lord yet turns away from them and forgets what his hands have sent ahead? what he has committed in the way of disbelief and acts of disobedience. Indeed on their hearts We have cast veils coverings lest they should understand it that is lest they should comprehend the Qur’ān in other words and so as a result they do not comprehend it; and in their ears a deafness a heaviness and so they do not hear it; and though you call them to guidance they will not be guided in that case that is given the casting of veils mentioned ever.
وَرَبُّكَ ٱلْغَفُورُ ذُو ٱلرَّحْمَةِ لَوْ يُؤَاخِذُهُم بِمَا كَسَبُواْ لَعَجَّلَ لَهُمُ ٱلْعَذَابَ بَل لَّهُم مَّوْعِدٌ لَّن يَجِدُواْ مِن دُونِهِ مَوْئِلاً,And your Lord is the Forgiver Full of Mercy. Were He to take them to task in this world for what they have earned He would have hastened for them the chastisement therein; but they have a tryst which is the Day of Resurrection from which they will not find any escape any refuge.
وَتِلْكَ ٱلْقُرَىٰ أَهْلَكْنَاهُمْ لَمَّا ظَلَمُواْ وَجَعَلْنَا لِمَهْلِكِهِم مَّوْعِداً,And those towns that is to say the inhabitants of those towns such as ‘Ād and Thamūd as well as others We destroyed them when they did evil when they disbelieved and We appointed for their destruction a variant reading for mahlikihim has muhlakihim a tryst.
وَإِذْ قَالَ مُوسَىٰ لِفَتَٰهُ لاۤ أَبْرَحُ حَتَّىٰ أَبْلُغَ مَجْمَعَ ٱلْبَحْرَيْنِ أَوْ أَمْضِيَ حُقُباً,And mention when Moses son of Amram ‘Imrān said to his lad Joshua son of Nun Yūsha‘ bin Nūn who used to follow him around serve him and acquire knowledge from him ‘I will not give up I will not stop journeying until I have reached the juncture of the two seas — the point where the Byzantine sea and the Persian sea meet beyond the east — though I march on for ages’ for a very long time before reaching it if it be far.
فَلَمَّا بَلَغَا مَجْمَعَ بَيْنِهِمَا نَسِيَا حُوتَهُمَا فَٱتَّخَذَ سَبِيلَهُ فِي ٱلْبَحْرِ سَرَباً,So when they reached a juncture between the two between the two seas they forgot their fish — Joshua forgot his luggage leaving it behind at the moment of departure and Moses forgot to remind him — and so it the fish made its way into the sea that is it formed it — through God’s forming it — by burrowing that is like through a burrow which is a passage that is long and enclosed; this was so because God exalted be He held back the flow of the water preventing it from engulfing the fish and it the water withdrew from around it the fish and remained thus like a cleft without closing and what was beneath it the cleft stood still.
فَلَمَّا جَاوَزَا قَالَ لِفَتَٰهُ آتِنَا غَدَآءَنَا لَقَدْ لَقِينَا مِن سَفَرِنَا هَـٰذَا نَصَباً,And when they had made the traverse of that location having journeyed until the morning of the following day he Moses said to his lad ‘Bring us our breakfast ghadā’ that meal which is consumed at the beginning of the day. We have certainly encountered on this journey of ours much fatigue’ exhaustion which took its effect on them after the traverse.
قَالَ أَرَأَيْتَ إِذْ أَوَيْنَآ إِلَى ٱلصَّخْرَةِ فَإِنِّي نَسِيتُ ٱلْحُوتَ وَمَآ أَنْسَانِيهُ إِلاَّ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنُ أَنْ أَذْكُرَهُ وَٱتَّخَذَ سَبِيلَهُ فِي ٱلْبَحْرِ عَجَباً,He said ‘Do you see? — in other words remember when we sheltered at the rock in that location indeed I forgot the fish — and none but Satan made me forget al-shaytān ‘Satan’ substitutes for the suffixed pronoun hā’ of ansānī-hu to mention it an adhkurahu an inclusive substitution in other words it should be understood as ansānī dhikrahu ‘he Satan made me forget the mentioning of it’ — and it the fish made its way into the sea in an amazing manner’ ‘ajaban constitutes the second direct object that is to say Moses and his lad were amazed by it because of what has already been explained concerning it.
قَالَ ذَلِكَ مَا كُنَّا نَبْغِ فَٱرْتَدَّا عَلَىٰ آثَارِهِمَا قَصَصاً,Said he Moses ‘That namely our losing the fish is what we have been seeking!’ what we have been after for it is a sign for us of the presence of the one whom we seek. So they turned back retracing their footsteps until they reached the rock.
فَوَجَدَا عَبْداً مِّنْ عِبَادِنَآ آتَيْنَاهُ رَحْمَةً مِّنْ عِندِنَا وَعَلَّمْنَاهُ مِن لَّدُنَّا عِلْماً,So there they found one of Our servants namely al-Khidr to whom We had given mercy from Us — according to one opinion this mercy was prophethood; according to another it was authority and this latter is the opinion of the majority of scholars — and We had taught him knowledge from Us ‘ilman is the second direct object in other words some knowledge of unseen things; al-Bukhārī reports the following hadīth ‘Moses was delivering a sermon among the Children of Israel and was asked “Who is the most knowledgeable of people?” to which he Moses said “Myself”. God then reproached him for not having attributed his knowledge as coming from Him. God then revealed to him the following “Truly there is a servant of Mine at the juncture of the two seas; he is more knowledgeable than you”. Moses then asked “My Lord how do I reach him?” He God said ‘Take a fish with you and place it in a basket and the place where you lose the fish will be the place where he is.” He Moses took a fish and placed it in a basket and departed together with his lad Joshua son of Nun until they reached the rock. There they placed their heads back and fell asleep. The fish began to move about in the basket until it escaped from it and fell into the sea and it made its way into the sea in an amazing manner. God then held back the flow of the water preventing it from engulfing the fish forming a kind of arch over it. When he awoke his companion Joshua forgot to inform him of what had happened to the fish and so they journeyed on for the remainder of that day and night until on the morning of the second day Moses said to his lad ‘Bring us our breakfast’ to where he says and it made its way into the sea in an amazing manner’. He Bukhārī said ‘For the fish it the way into the sea was by ‘burrowing’ saraban and for Moses and his lad it this way was ‘amazing’ ‘ajaban …’ and so on to the end of Bukhārī’s report.
قَالَ لَهُ مُوسَىٰ هَلْ أَتَّبِعُكَ عَلَىٰ أَن تُعَلِّمَنِ مِمَّا عُلِّمْتَ رُشْداً,Moses said to him ‘May I follow you for the purpose that you teach me of what you have been taught in the way of probity?’ namely something of right conduct through which I might be rightly-guided a variant reading for rashadan has rushdan ‘probity’; he asked him this because to increase one’s knowledge is something which is always sought.
قَالَ إِنَّكَ لَن تَسْتَطِيعَ مَعِيَ صَبْراً,Said he ‘Truly you will not be able to bear with me.
وَكَيْفَ تَصْبِرُ عَلَىٰ مَا لَمْ تُحِطْ بِهِ خُبْراً,And how can you bear with that whereof you have never been informed?’ in the above-mentioned hadīth of Bukhārī after this verse there is the following statement ‘O Moses I possess knowledge which God has taught me and which you do not have and equally you possess knowledge which God has taught you and which I do not have’. His saying khubran ‘informed’ is a verbal noun meaning that which you have never encompassed in other words the truth of which you have never been informed of.
قَالَ سَتَجِدُنِيۤ إِن شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ صَابِراً وَلاَ أَعْصِي لَكَ أمْراً,He said ‘You will find me God willing patient and I will not disobey in other words and you will also find me non-disobedient towards you in any matter’ with which you charge me. He Moses made this statement conditional upon the Will of God because he was not confident of himself in what he had committed himself to. Indeed this is the custom of prophets and saints namely that they do not put their trust in themselves for a single moment.
قَالَ فَإِنِ ٱتَّبَعْتَنِي فَلاَ تَسْأَلْني عَن شَيءٍ حَتَّىٰ أُحْدِثَ لَكَ مِنْهُ ذِكْراً,He said ‘If you follow me then do not question me lā tas’alnī a variant reading has lā tas’alannī concerning anything that you might find objectionable in what I do according to your limited knowledge and be patient until I myself make mention of it to you’ in other words until I mention it to you with an explication of the reason for it. Moses accepted his precondition bearing in mind the respect which a student should exercise in the presence of a teacher.
فَٱنْطَلَقَا حَتَّىٰ إِذَا رَكِبَا فِي ٱلسَّفِينَةِ خَرَقَهَا قَالَ أَخَرَقْتَهَا لِتُغْرِقَ أَهْلَهَا لَقَدْ جِئْتَ شَيْئاً إِمْراً,So they set off making their way on foot along the coast of the sea until when they embarked on the ship which was carrying them he al-Khidr made a hole in it by destroying a plank or two on the starboard side with an axe after they had sailed into deep waters. Said he Moses to him ‘Did you make a hole in it to drown its people? li-tughriqa ahlahā ‘for you to drown its people’; a variant reading has li-yaghraqa ahluhā ‘so that its people might drown’. You have certainly done a dreadful thing’ that is a grave and reprehensible thing — it is reported that the water did not actually penetrate it.
قَالَ أَلَمْ أَقُلْ إِنَّكَ لَن تَسْتَطِيعَ مَعِيَ صَبْراً,He said ‘Did I not say that you would not be able to bear with me?’
قَالَ لاَ تُؤَاخِذْنِي بِمَا نَسِيتُ وَلاَ تُرْهِقْنِي مِنْ أَمْرِي عُسْراً,He said ‘Do not take me to task on account of that which I forgot that is on account of the fact that I was not mindful of submitting to you in the matter and of refraining from showing disapproval of your actions and do not exhaust me do not charge me in this affair of mine with difficulty’ with hardship during my companionship of you in other words treat me throughout it with forgiveness and indulgence.
فَٱنْطَلَقَا حَتَّىٰ إِذَا لَقِيَا غُلاَماً فَقَتَلَهُ قَالَ أَقَتَلْتَ نَفْساً زَكِيَّةً بِغَيْرِ نَفْسٍ لَّقَدْ جِئْتَ شَيْئاً نُّكْراً,So they set off after leaving the ship making their way on foot until when they met a boy who had not yet reached puberty playing with other boys among whom his face was the fairest — and he al-Khidr slew him by slitting his throat with a knife while he lay down or by tearing his head off with his hand or by smashing his head against a wall all of which are different opinions the coordinating fā’ of fa-qatalahu ‘and he slew him’ is used here because it indicates that the slaying took place after the encounter; the response to idhā ‘when’ is the following statement qāla … — he Moses said to him ‘Have you slain an innocent soul that is a pure one that had not reached the age of legal responsibility a variant reading for zākiya has zakiyya one slain not in retaliation for another soul? in other words one that has not slain any soul. Verily you have committed an dreadful thing’ read nukran or nukuran that is to say an abomination.
قَالَ أَلَمْ أَقُلْ لَّكَ إِنَّكَ لَن تَسْتَطِيعَ مَعِيَ صَبْراً,He said ‘Did I not say to you that you would never be able to bear with me?’ laka ‘to you’ has been added to that same statement which was made before because this time there could not be any excuse for Moses’s impatience.
قَالَ إِن سَأَلْتُكَ عَن شَيْءٍ بَعْدَهَا فَلاَ تُصَٰحِبْنِي قَدْ بَلَغْتَ مِن لَّدُنِّي عُذْراً,And for this reason he said ‘If I ask you about anything after this after this instance then do not keep me in your company do not allow me to follow you for truly you will have found from me read ladunnī or ladunī on my part sufficient enough excuse’ for you to part company with me.
فَٱنطَلَقَا حَتَّىٰ إِذَآ أَتَيَآ أَهْلَ قَرْيَةٍ ٱسْتَطْعَمَآ أَهْلَهَا فَأَبَوْاْ أَن يُضَيِّفُوهُمَا فَوَجَدَا فِيهَا جِدَاراً يُرِيدُ أَن يَنقَضَّ فَأَقَامَهُ قَالَ لَوْ شِئْتَ لَتَّخَذْتَ عَلَيْهِ أَجْراً,So they set off until when they came to the folk of a certain town namely Antioch Antākya they asked its folk for food they asked them for food by way of hospitality but they refused to extend them any hospitality. They then found in it a wall one hundred cubits high about to collapse that is it was close to falling down because of its tilt; so he al-Khidr straightened it with his own hands. He Moses said to him ‘Had you wished you could have taken a variant reading for la-ttakhadhta has la-takhidhta a wage for it’ some sort of payment since they did not extend us any hospitality despite our need for food.
قَالَ هَـٰذَا فِرَاقُ بَيْنِي وَبَيْنِكَ سَأُنَبِّئُكَ بِتَأْوِيلِ مَا لَمْ تَسْتَطِع عَّلَيْهِ صَبْراً,Said he al-Khidr to him ‘This is the parting that is the moment for parting between me and you baynī wa-baynika here the preposition bayna has been annexed to a non-multiple noun but this is allowed grammatically because it is then repeated with its other noun together with the coordinating wāw. I will inform you before I part company with you the interpretation of that over which you were not able to maintain patience.
أَمَّا ٱلسَّفِينَةُ فَكَانَتْ لِمَسَاكِينَ يَعْمَلُونَ فِي ٱلْبَحْرِ فَأَرَدتُّ أَنْ أَعِيبَهَا وَكَانَ وَرَآءَهُم مَّلِكٌ يَأْخُذُ كُلَّ سَفِينَةٍ غَصْباً,As for the ship it belonged to poor people ten in number who earned a living on the sea with it leasing it to others as a way of gaining a living; and I wanted to make it defective for behind them whenever they returned — or meaning before them now — was a king a disbeliever seizing every ship that was usable by force ghasban is in the accusative as a verbal noun containing an explanation of the nature of such ‘seizure’.
وَأَمَّا ٱلْغُلاَمُ فَكَانَ أَبَوَاهُ مُؤْمِنَيْنِ فَخَشِينَآ أَن يُرْهِقَهُمَا طُغْيَاناً وَكُفْراً,And as for the boy his parents were believers and We feared lest he should overwhelm them with insolence and disbelief — for he is as described by the hadīth of Muslim ‘He was incorrigibly disposed to disbelief and had he lived longer this disposition of his would have oppressed them because of their love for him they would have followed him in such a path of disbelief’.
فَأَرَدْنَآ أَن يُبْدِلَهُمَا رَبُّهُمَا خَيْراً مِّنْهُ زَكَـاةً وَأَقْرَبَ رُحْماً,So We desired that their Lord should give them in exchange read yubaddilahumā or yubdilahumā one better than him in purity that is in righteousness and God-fearing and closer than him to mercy read ruhman or ruhuman in other words it is to be understood as rahmatan ‘by way of mercy’ namely closer to dutifulness towards his parents. Thus God exalted be He gave them in exchange a girl who afterwards married a prophet and gave birth to a prophet through whom God guided an entire community.
وَأَمَّا ٱلْجِدَارُ فَكَانَ لِغُلاَمَيْنِ يَتِيمَيْنِ فِي ٱلْمَدِينَةِ وَكَانَ تَحْتَهُ كَنزٌ لَّهُمَا وَكَانَ أَبُوهُمَا صَالِحاً فَأَرَادَ رَبُّكَ أَن يَبْلُغَآ أَشُدَّهُمَا وَيَسْتَخْرِجَا كَنزَهُمَا رَحْمَةً مِّن رَّبِّكَ وَمَا فَعَلْتُهُ عَنْ أَمْرِي ذَلِكَ تَأْوِيلُ مَا لَمْ تَسْطِـع عَّلَيْهِ صَبْراً,And as for the wall it belonged to two orphan boys who lived in the city and beneath it there was a treasure a buried trove of gold and silver belonging to them. Their father had been a righteous man and so because of his righteousness they were protected both in terms of their souls and their possessions and your Lord desired that they should come of age that is He desired for them the attainment of maturity and extract their treasure as a mercy from your Lord rahmatan min rabbik is a direct object denoting reason operated by the verb arāda ‘He desired’. And I did not do it namely what has been mentioned of his making a hole in the ship the slaying of the boy and the repair of the wall of my own accord that is out of my own choosing; nay it was because of a command in the form of an inspiration from God. This is the interpretation of that over which you could not maintain patience’ one may say istā‘a or istatā‘a to mean ‘he had the capacity for something’; in this instance and the previous one both forms of the verb have been used. Moreover there is a variety of expression in the use of fa-aradtu ‘I desired’ fa-aradnā ‘We desired’ and fa-arāda rabbuk ‘Your Lord desired’.
وَيَسْأَلُونَكَ عَن ذِي ٱلْقَرْنَيْنِ قُلْ سَأَتْلُواْ عَلَيْكُم مِّنْهُ ذِكْراً,And they the Jews question you concerning Dhū’l-Qarnayn whose name was Alexander; he was not a prophet. Say ‘I shall recite relate to you a mention an account of him’ of his affair.
إِنَّا مَكَّنَّا لَهُ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَآتَيْنَاهُ مِن كُلِّ شَيْءٍ سَبَباً,Indeed We empowered him throughout the land by facilitating for him the journeying therein and We gave him to everything of which one might have need a way a route to lead him to that which he sought.
فَأَتْبَعَ سَبَباً,And he followed a way he took a route towards the west
حَتَّىٰ إِذَا بَلَغَ مَغْرِبَ ٱلشَّمْسِ وَجَدَهَا تَغْرُبُ فِي عَيْنٍ حَمِئَةٍ وَوَجَدَ عِندَهَا قَوْماً قُلْنَا يٰذَا ٱلْقَرْنَيْنِ إِمَّآ أَن تُعَذِّبَ وَإِمَّآ أَن تَتَّخِذَ فِيهِمْ حُسْناً,until when he reached the setting of the sun the place where it sets he found it setting in a muddy spring ‘ayn hami’a a spring containing ham’a which is black clay its setting in a spring is described as seen from the perspective of the eye for otherwise it is far larger in size than this world; and he found by it that is by the spring a folk of disbelievers. We said ‘O Dhū’l-Qarnayn — by means of inspiration — either chastise the folk by slaying them or treat them kindly’ by merely taking them captive.
قَالَ أَمَّا مَن ظَلَمَ فَسَوْفَ نُعَذِّبُهُ ثُمَّ يُرَدُّ إِلَىٰ رَبِّهِ فَيُعَذِّبُهُ عَذَاباً نُّكْراً,He said ‘As for him who does wrong by way of practising idolatry we shall chastise him We shall slay him. Then he shall be returned to his Lord and He shall chastise him with an awful chastisement read nukran or nukuran that is a severe one in the Fire.
وَأَمَّا مَنْ آمَنَ وَعَمِلَ صَالِحاً فَلَهُ جَزَآءً ٱلْحُسْنَىٰ وَسَنَقُولُ لَهُ مِنْ أَمْرِنَا يُسْراً,But as for him who believes and acts righteously he shall have the fairest reward namely Paradise the annexation construction jazā’u l-husnā ‘the fairest reward’ is explicative; a variant reading has jazā’an al-husnā ‘he shall have as a requital that which is fairest’; al-Farrā’ said that this accusative reading of jazā’an is intended as an explanation of the nature of the requital by way of attribution to ‘that which is fairest’; and we shall speak to him mildly in our command’ that is to say we shall command him with what he will find easy to bear.
ثُمَّ أَتْبَعَ سَبَباً,Then he followed a way towards the east
حَتَّىٰ إِذَا بَلَغَ مَطْلِعَ ٱلشَّمْسِ وَجَدَهَا تَطْلُعُ عَلَىٰ قَوْمٍ لَّمْ نَجْعَل لَّهُمْ مِّن دُونِهَا سِتْراً,until when he reached the rising of the sun the place where it rises he found it rising on a folk namely Negroes zanj for whom We had not provided against it that is against the sun any form of cover in the way of clothing or roofing as their land could not support any structures; they had underground tunnels into which they would disappear at the rising of the sun and out of which they would emerge when it was at its highest point in the sky.
كَذَلِكَ وَقَدْ أَحَطْنَا بِمَا لَدَيْهِ خُبْراً,So it was in other words the situation was as We have stated; and We encompassed whatever pertained to him that is what Dhū’l-Qarnayn possessed in the way of machinery men and otherwise in knowledge.
ثُمَّ أَتْبَعَ سَبَباً,Then he followed a way
حَتَّىٰ إِذَا بَلَغَ بَيْنَ السَّدَّيْنِ وَجَدَ مِن دُونِهِمَا قَوْماً لاَّ يَكَادُونَ يَفْقَهُونَ قَوْلاً,until when he reached between the two barriers read al-saddayn or al-suddayn here and likewise further below at verse 94 saddan or suddan — these were two mountains lying in the remote regions beyond the land of the Turks; Alexander sealed the breach between the two as will be described below — he found on this side of them that is in front of them a folk that could scarcely comprehend speech in other words they could only understand it after much agonising a variant reading for yafqahūna ‘comprehend’ has yufqihūna ‘be understood’.
قَالُواْ يٰذَا ٱلْقَرْنَيْنِ إِنَّ يَأْجُوجَ وَمَأْجُوجَ مُفْسِدُونَ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ فَهَلْ نَجْعَلُ لَكَ خَرْجاً عَلَىٰ أَن تَجْعَلَ بَيْنَنَا وَبَيْنَهُمْ سَدّاً,They said ‘O Dhū’l-Qarnayn truly Gog and Magog read Ya’jūj wa-Ma’jūj or Yājūj wa-Mājūj these two are non-Arabic names of two tribes and are therefore indeclinable are causing corruption in the land plundering and oppressing us when they come forth to attack us. So shall we pay you a tribute some form of payment a variant reading for kharjan is kharājan on condition that you build between us and them a barrier? an obstruction so that they will not be able to reach us.
قَالَ مَا مَكَّنِّي فِيهِ رَبِّي خَيْرٌ فَأَعِينُونِي بِقُوَّةٍ أَجْعَلْ بَيْنَكُمْ وَبَيْنَهُمْ رَدْماً,He said ‘That wealth and so on wherewith my Lord has empowered me makkannī a variant reading has makkananī is better than the tribute that you offer me and so I have no need for it. I shall build for you the barrier without demanding a fee; so help me with strength in that which I will demand from you and I will build between you and them a rampart a fortified barricade.
آتُونِي زُبَرَ ٱلْحَدِيدِ حَتَّىٰ إِذَا سَاوَىٰ بَيْنَ ٱلصَّدَفَيْنِ قَالَ ٱنفُخُواْ حَتَّىٰ إِذَا جَعَلَهُ نَاراً قَالَ آتُونِيۤ أُفْرِغْ عَلَيْهِ قِطْراً,Bring me ingots of iron!’ namely pieces thereof as large as the blocks of stone to be used in the construction; he used these ingots in his construction placing between them firewood and coal. Until when he had levelled up the gap between the two flanks read al-sudufayn or al-sadafayn or al-sudfayn meaning the two flanks of the two mountains he set up bellows and lit a fire around this construction — he said ‘Blow!’ and they blew until when he had made it namely the iron a fire that is like a fire he said ‘Bring me molten copper to pour over it’ the two verbs ātūnī ‘bring me’ and ufrigh ‘pour’ are in contention over this direct object qitran ‘molten copper’; it this direct object has been omitted before the first verb because it is being governed by the second verb. Thus he poured the molten copper over the hot iron so that it penetrated between the individual ingots making a solid single whole.
فَمَا ٱسْطَاعُوۤاْ أَن يَظْهَرُوهُ وَمَا ٱسْتَطَاعُواْ لَهُ نَقْباً,And so they Gog and Magog were not able to scale it to climb up its length because of its great height and smoothness nor could they pierce it because of its firmness and thickness.
قَالَ هَـٰذَا رَحْمَةٌ مِّن رَّبِّي فَإِذَا جَآءَ وَعْدُ رَبِّي جَعَلَهُ دَكَّآءَ وَكَانَ وَعْدُ رَبِّي حَقّاً,Said he Dhū’l-Qarnayn ‘This namely the barrier the ability to make it is a mercy from my Lord a grace from Him because it prevents them from coming forth. But when the promise of my Lord comes to pass the promise of their coming forth which will be near the time of the Resurrection He will level it pulverised and flattened for my Lord’s promise of their coming forth and of other things is always true’ it will be. God exalted be He says
وَتَرَكْنَا بَعْضَهُمْ يَوْمَئِذٍ يَمُوجُ فِي بَعْضٍ وَنُفِخَ فِي ٱلصُّورِ فَجَمَعْنَاهُمْ جَمْعاً,And on that day the day of their coming forth We shall let some of them surge against others mixing with one another on account of their multitude and the Trumpet namely the Horn signalling the Resurrection shall be blown and We shall gather them namely creatures in one place on the Day of Resurrection a single gathering.
وَعَرَضْنَا جَهَنَّمَ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْكَافِرِينَ عَرْضاً,And on that day We shall present We shall bring close Hell to the disbelievers plain to view
ٱلَّذِينَ كَانَتْ أَعْيُنُهُمْ فِي غِطَآءٍ عَن ذِكْرِي وَكَانُواْ لاَ يَسْتَطِيعُونَ سَمْعاً,those disbelievers whose eyes alladhīna kānat a‘yunuhum substitutes for al-kāfirīna ‘the disbelievers’ were masked from My remembrance namely the Qur’ān such that they were blind unable to be guided thereby and who could not bear to hear that is to say they were unable to listen to what the Prophet used to recite to them out of spite for him and so they did not believe therein.
أَفَحَسِبَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوۤاْ أَن يَتَّخِذُواْ عِبَادِي مِن دُونِيۤ أَوْلِيَآءَ إِنَّآ أَعْتَدْنَا جَهَنَّمَ لِلْكَافِرِينَ نُزُلاً,Do the disbelievers reckon that they can take My servants namely My angels as well as Jesus and Ezra as patrons as lords beside Me? awliyā’a ‘as patrons’ constitutes the second direct object of the verb yattakhidhū ‘that they can take’; the second direct object of the verb hasiba ‘reckon’ has been omitted. The meaning is do they suppose that the mentioned ‘taking as patrons’ will not incur My wrath and that I will not punish them for this? No! Truly We have prepared Hell for the disbelievers these the ones mentioned above and others as a place of hospitality in other words it has been prepared for them just as a house is prepared for a guest.
قُلْ هَلْ نُنَبِّئُكُم بِٱلأَخْسَرِينَ أَعْمَالاً,Say ‘Shall We inform you who will be the greatest losers in regard to their works? al-akhsarīna a‘mālan a specification that happens to correspond to that which is specifically meant; and these losers are described in His words as being
ٱلَّذِينَ ضَلَّ سَعْيُهُمْ فِي ٱلْحَيَاةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَهُمْ يَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّهُمْ يُحْسِنُونَ صُنْعاً,Those whose effort goes astray in the life of this world those whose deeds are invalid while they reckon they think that they are doing good work good deeds for which they will be rewarded.
أُوْلَـٰئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ بِآيَاتِ رَبِّهِمْ وَلِقَائِهِ فَحَبِطَتْ أَعْمَالُهُمْ فَلاَ نُقِيمُ لَهُمْ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ وَزْناً,Those are they who disbelieve in the signs of their Lord in the proofs of His Oneness proofs such as the Qur’ān and otherwise and the encounter with Him’ that is and who disbelieve in resurrection reckoning reward and punishment. So their works have failed they are invalid and on the Day of Resurrection We shall not assign any weight to them in other words We shall not accord them any value.
ذَلِكَ جَزَآؤُهُمْ جَهَنَّمُ بِمَا كَفَرُواْ وَٱتَّخَذُوۤاْ آيَاتِي وَرُسُلِي هُزُواً,That namely the matter which I God have mentioned concerning the failure of their deeds and so on dhālika ‘that’ constitutes the subject is their requital — Hell — because they disbelieved and took My signs and My messengers in mockery that is to say taking both of them as something to be derided.
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ كَانَتْ لَهُمْ جَنَّاتُ ٱلْفِرْدَوْسِ نُزُلاً,Truly those who believe and perform righteous deeds — theirs will be according to God’s prescience the gardens of Firdaws which are at the centre of Paradise and at its highest part the annexation thereto of firdaws to jannāt ‘gardens’ is explicative as a place of hospitality as an abode;
خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا لاَ يَبْغُونَ عَنْهَا حِوَلاً,wherein they will abide with no desire demand to be removed from them to be transferred to some other gardens.
قُل لَّوْ كَانَ ٱلْبَحْرُ مِدَاداً لِّكَلِمَاتِ رَبِّي لَنَفِدَ ٱلْبَحْرُ قَبْلَ أَن تَنفَدَ كَلِمَاتُ رَبِّي وَلَوْ جِئْنَا بِمِثْلِهِ مَدَداً,Say ‘If the sea in other words if its waters were ink midād is what one writes with for the Words of my Lord Words that testify to His laws and His marvels such that these Words are written with it the sea would be spent in recording them before the Words of my Lord were spent read as tanfada or yanfada even though We brought the like of it namely the like of the sea as replenishment’ in order to add it to the other sea it would also be spent while they God’s Words would not be exhausted madadan ‘as replenishment’ in the accusative because it is a specification.
قُلْ إِنَّمَآ أَنَاْ بَشَرٌ مِّثْلُكُمْ يُوحَىٰ إِلَيَّ أَنَّمَآ إِلَـٰهُكُمْ إِلَـٰهٌ وَاحِدٌ فَمَن كَانَ يَرْجُواْ لِقَآءَ رَبِّهِ فَلْيَعْمَلْ عَمَلاً صَالِحاً وَلاَ يُشْرِكْ بِعِبَادَةِ رَبِّهِ أَحَدَاً,Say ‘I am only a human being a son of Adam like you; it has been revealed to me that your God is only One God annamā the anna assimilated with the mā retains its function of referring to the verbal noun in other words the Oneness of the Divine is what is being revealed to me. So whoever hopes to encounter his Lord through the Resurrection and the Requital let him do righteous work and not associate with the worship of his Lord that is to say let him not commit idolatry in performing it by feigning faith before anyone’.
كۤهيعۤصۤ,Kāf hā yā ‘ayn sād God knows best what He means by these letters.
ذِكْرُ رَحْمَتِ رَبِّكَ عَبْدَهُ زَكَرِيَّآ,This is a mention of your Lord’s mercy to His servant ‘abdahu a direct object of rahma ‘mercy’ Zachariah an explication of it the direct object
إِذْ نَادَىٰ رَبَّهُ نِدَآءً خَفِيّاً,when idh is semantically connected to rahma ‘mercy’ he called out to his Lord a call entailing a supplication in secret in the middle of the night because this time of the night invites a faster response to one’s supplication.
قَالَ رَبِّ إِنَّي وَهَنَ ٱلْعَظْمُ مِنِّي وَٱشْتَعَلَ ٱلرَّأْسُ شَيْباً وَلَمْ أَكُنْ بِدُعَآئِكَ رَبِّ شَقِيّاً,He said ‘My Lord truly the bones all the bones within me have become feeble weak and my head is alight with grey hair shayban a specification derived from the subject of the verb in other words hoariness has spread throughout his hairs just as a spark of fire spreads through firewood and I wish to supplicate to you and I have never been in my supplications to You my Lord unsuccessful that is I have never been disappointed in the past so do not disappoint me in what follows.
وَإِنِّي خِفْتُ ٱلْمَوَالِيَ مِن وَرَآءِى وَكَانَتِ ٱمْرَأَتِي عَاقِراً فَهَبْ لِي مِن لَّدُنْكَ وَلِيّاً,And truly I fear my kinsfolk namely those who will succeed me as closest after me in kinship such as my paternal cousins after me that is after my death I fear for the religion lest they forsake it as You have witnessed in the case of the Children of Israel in the way that they changed their religion and my wife is barren she does not conceive. So grant me from Yourself a successor a son
يَرِثُنِي وَيَرِثُ مِنْ آلِ يَعْقُوبَ وَٱجْعَلْهُ رَبِّ رَضِيّاً,who may inherit from me read yarithnī in apocopated form as a response to the imperative statement fa-hab lī ‘grant me’ or read yarithunī as an adjectival qualification of waliyyan ‘a successor’ and inherit also read in both ways mentioned from the House of Jacob my forefather inherit knowledge and prophethood and make him my Lord acceptable’ that is pleasing to you.
يٰزَكَرِيَّآ إِنَّا نُبَشِّرُكَ بِغُلاَمٍ ٱسْمُهُ يَحْيَىٰ لَمْ نَجْعَل لَّهُ مِن قَبْلُ سَمِيّاً,God exalted be He in responding to his request for a son that will be the incarnation of His mercy says ‘O Zachariah! Indeed We give you good tidings of a boy who will inherit in the way that you have requested — whose name is John. Never before have We made anyone his namesake’ that is never has there been anyone with the name ‘John’.
قَالَ رَبِّ أَنَّىٰ يَكُونُ لِي غُلاَمٌ وَكَانَتِ ٱمْرَأَتِي عَاقِراً وَقَدْ بَلَغْتُ مِنَ ٱلْكِبَرِ عِتِيّاً,He said ‘My Lord how shall I have a son when my wife is barren and I have reached infirm old age?’ ‘itiyyan derives from the verb ‘atā ‘it became withered’ in other words he had reached extreme old age 120 years; and his wife had reached the age of 98 ‘atiya in terms of its root derives from ‘utuwwun but the tā’ is vowelled as -ti- to soften it the first wāw vowel is changed into a yā’ to be in harmony with the –ti- vowelling while the second wāw letter is changed into a yā’ so that the previous yā’ can be assimilated with it.
قَالَ كَذٰلِكَ قَالَ رَبُّكَ هُوَ عَلَيَّ هَيِّنٌ وَقَدْ خَلَقْتُكَ مِن قَبْلُ وَلَمْ تَكُ شَيْئاً,He said ‘It the matter in question of creating a boy from both of you shall be so! Your Lord says “It is easy for Me namely to restore your sexual potency and tear open your wife’s womb in preparation for conception for I certainly created you before when you were nothing”’ you were nothing before your created form became manifest. As God wished to manifest this great power He inspired him the form of the question in order for him to receive the response that will indicate it this power. And when his soul yearned for the prompt arrival of that whereof he had been given good tidings
قَالَ رَبِّ ٱجْعَل لِيۤ آيَةً قَالَ آيَتُكَ أَلاَّ تُكَلِّمَ ٱلنَّاسَ ثَلاَثَ لَيَالٍ سَوِيّاً,He said ‘Lord appoint for me some sign’ namely some indication of my wife’s becoming pregnant. Said He ‘Your sign for this is that you shall not speak to people that is that you should refrain from speaking to them but not from speaking the remembrance of God exalted be He for three nights that is together with the days thereof as stated in sūrat Āl ‘Imrān ‘for three days’ Q. 341 while you are in sound health’ sawiyyan a circumstantial qualifier referring to the subject of the verb tukallima ‘you shall not speak’ in other words despite there being no defect in you.
فَخَرَجَ عَلَىٰ قَوْمِهِ مِنَ ٱلْمِحْرَابِ فَأَوْحَىٰ إِلَيْهِمْ أَن سَبِّحُواْ بُكْرَةً وَعَشِيّاً,So he emerged before his people from the sanctuary that is from the temple — they had been waiting for him to open it in order to perform their prayers therein after his command as was the custom — and signalled indicated to them ‘Make glorifications perform prayers at morning and evening’ at the beginning of the day and at its end as per usual. He then realised upon his being prevented from speaking to them that she was pregnant with John.
يٰيَحْيَىٰ خُذِ ٱلْكِتَابَ بِقُوَّةٍ وَآتَيْنَاهُ ٱلْحُكْمَ صَبِيّاً,And two years after his birth God exalted be He said to him ‘O John! Hold on to the Scripture namely the Torah firmly’ earnestly. And We gave him judgement prophethood while still a child a three-year old;
وَحَنَاناً مِّن لَّدُنَّا وَزَكَاةً وَكَانَ تَقِيّاً,and compassion a mercy for mankind from Us from Our presence and purity a charity for them and he was God-fearing — it is related that he never committed a sin nor contemplated committing one;
وَبَرّاً بِوَالِدَيْهِ وَلَمْ يَكُن جَبَّاراً عَصِيّاً,and dutiful to his parents that is virtuous towards them. And he was not arrogant or rebellious disobedient to his Lord.
وَسَلاَمٌ عَلَيْهِ يَوْمَ وُلِدَ وَيَوْمَ يَمُوتُ وَيَوْمَ يُبْعَثُ حَياً,‘And peace from Us be upon him the day he was born and the day he dies and the day he shall be raised alive!’ that is on those fearful days in which he sees what he will never have seen before — in these he will be given security from fear.
وَٱذْكُرْ فِي ٱلْكِتَابِ مَرْيَمَ إِذِ ٱنتَبَذَتْ مِنْ أَهْلِهَا مَكَاناً شَرْقِياً,And mention in the Book in the Qur’ān Mary that is mention her tale when she withdrew from her family to an easterly place that is when she secluded herself in a place on the east side of her home.
فَٱتَّخَذَتْ مِن دُونِهِم حِجَاباً فَأَرْسَلْنَآ إِلَيْهَآ رُوحَنَا فَتَمَثَّلَ لَهَا بَشَراً سَوِيّاً,Thus she veiled herself from them she draped herself in a veil to conceal herself while she washed her hair from lice or washed her clothes or cleansed herself from her menses; whereupon We sent to her Our Spirit Gabriel and he assumed before her after she donned her clothes the likeness of a well-proportioned human perfect in physical form.
قَالَتْ إِنِّيۤ أَعُوذُ بِٱلرَّحْمَـٰنِ مِنكَ إِن كُنتَ تَقِيّاً,She said ‘Lo! I seek refuge in the Compassionate One from you! If you fear God’ and leave me alone on account of my invocation of refuge in God.
قَالَ إِنَّمَآ أَنَاْ رَسُولُ رَبِّكِ لأَهَبَ لَكِ غُلاَماً زَكِيّاً,He said ‘I am only a messenger of your Lord that I may give you a boy who shall be pure’ in his prophethood.
قَالَتْ أَنَّىٰ يَكُونُ لِي غُلاَمٌ وَلَمْ يَمْسَسْنِي بَشَرٌ وَلَمْ أَكُ بَغِيّاً,She said ‘How shall I have a boy when no human being has ever touched me by way of conjugality neither have I been unchaste?’ neither have I been a fornicator.
قَالَ كَذٰلِكَ قَالَ رَبُّكِ هُوَ عَلَيَّ هَيِّنٌ وَلِنَجْعَلَهُ آيَةً لِّلْنَّاسِ وَرَحْمَةً مِّنَّا وَكَانَ أَمْراً مَّقْضِيّاً,He said ‘It the matter in question of creating a boy from you without a father shall be so! Your Lord has said “It is easy for Me in other words by Gabriel’s breathing into you by My command so that you become pregnant with him — since what has been mentioned is meant as a reason the following statement is added as a supplement thereto and so that We may make him a sign for mankind of Our power and a mercy from Us to whoever believes in him. And it the creation of him is a thing already decreed”’ according to My knowledge. So Gabriel breathed into the opening of her shirt whereupon she sensed the formed foetus in her womb.
فَحَمَلَتْهُ فَٱنْتَبَذَتْ بِهِ مَكَاناً قَصِيّاً,Thus she conceived him and then withdrew retreated with him to a distant place far from her family.
فَأَجَآءَهَا ٱلْمَخَاضُ إِلَىٰ جِذْعِ ٱلنَّخْلَةِ قَالَتْ يٰلَيْتَنِي مِتُّ قَبْلَ هَـٰذَا وَكُنتُ نَسْياً مَّنسِيّاً,And the birth pangs the pains of childbirth brought her to the trunk of the palm-tree that she may support herself against it and then she gave birth the conception formation of the foetus and delivery all took place within one hour. She said ‘O yā is used to call attention to something would that I had died before this affair and become a forgotten thing beyond recall!’ a thing abandoned which no one knows or mentions.
فَنَادَاهَا مِن تَحْتِهَآ أَلاَّ تَحْزَنِي قَدْ جَعَلَ رَبُّكِ تَحْتَكِ سَرِيّاً,Then he called her from below her namely Gabriel — for he was lower than her ‘Do not grieve. Your Lord has made below you a rivulet a river of water which had dried up.
وَهُزِّىۤ إِلَيْكِ بِجِذْعِ ٱلنَّخْلَةِ تُسَاقِطْ عَلَيْكِ رُطَباً جَنِيّاً,And shake the trunk of the palm-tree towards you a palm-tree which had withered the bi- in bi-jidh‘i’l-nakhlati ‘the trunk of the palm-tree is extra — there will drop tusāqit originally this is tatasāqat but the second tā’ is changed into a sīn and is assimilated with the second sīn; a variant reading omits it the second tā’ altogether on you dates rutaban a specification fresh and ripe janiyyan an adjectival qualification of it of rutaban ‘dates’.
فَكُلِي وَٱشْرَبِي وَقَرِّي عَيْناً فَإِمَّا تَرَيِنَّ مِنَ ٱلبَشَرِ أَحَداً فَقُولِيۤ إِنِّي نَذَرْتُ لِلرَّحْمَـٰنِ صَوْماً فَلَنْ أُكَلِّمَ ٱلْيَوْمَ إِنسِيّاً,So eat of the dates and drink from the rivulet and let your eye be comforted by the child ‘aynan ‘your eye’ a specification derived from the subject of the verb in other words what is meant is li-taqarra ‘aynuki bihi ‘that your eye may be comforted by him’ that is let it your eye be at peace and not covet any other than him; and if immā the nūn of the conditional particle in is here assimilated with the extra mā you happen to see tarayinna the third consonantal root the yā’ and the second the hamza have been omitted with the fatha vowel therein transferred to the first consonant the letter rā’ and a kasra vowel applied to the yā’ of the feminine person because of two unvowelled consonants coming together any human being and should he ask you about your child then say “I have vowed to the Compassionate One a fast that is to say an abstention from speaking of his affair and from speaking to any other humans — which is indicated by the following statement so I will not speak to any human today”’ that is after saying this.
فَأَتَتْ بِهِ قَوْمَهَا تَحْمِلُهُ قَالُواْ يٰمَرْيَمُ لَقَدْ جِئْتِ شَيْئاً فَرِيّاً,Then carrying him she brought him to her folk tahmiluhu ‘carrying him’ a circumstantial qualifier and they saw him and they said ‘O Mary truly you have done a curious thing! an astounding thing for you have begotten a son without his having a father.
يٰأُخْتَ هَارُونَ مَا كَانَ أَبُوكِ ٱمْرَأَ سَوْءٍ وَمَا كَانَتْ أُمُّكِ بَغِيّاً,O sister of Aaron — he was a righteous man in other words what is meant is O you who are like him in terms of chastity — your father was not a wicked man that is a fornicator nor was your mother unchaste’ that is a fornicatress so how is it that you have this child?
فَأَشَارَتْ إِلَيْهِ قَالُواْ كَيْفَ نُكَلِّمُ مَن كَانَ فِي ٱلْمَهْدِ صَبِيّاً,Thereat she pointed them to him intimating to them that they ‘talk to him’. They said ‘How can we talk to one who is who happens to be in the cradle still a little child?’
قَالَ إِنِّي عَبْدُ ٱللَّهِ آتَانِيَ ٱلْكِتَابَ وَجَعَلَنِي نَبِيّاً,He said ‘Lo! I am God’s servant. He has given me the Scripture namely the Gospel and made me a prophet.
وَجَعَلَنِي مُبَارَكاً أَيْنَ مَا كُنتُ وَأَوْصَانِي بِٱلصَّلاَةِ وَٱلزَّكَاةِ مَا دُمْتُ حَيّاً,And He has made me blessed wherever I may be that is He has made me of great benefit to mankind — this is a foretelling of what had been preordained for him — and He has enjoined upon me prayer and alms-giving He has commanded me to do both of these as long as I remain alive;
وَبَرّاً بِوَٰلِدَتِي وَلَمْ يَجْعَلْنِي جَبَّاراً شَقِيّاً,and He has made me dutiful towards my mother barran in the accusative because of the implicit verb ja‘alanī ‘He has made me’. And He has not made me arrogant haughty wretched disobedient to his Lord.
وَٱلسَّلاَمُ عَلَيَّ يَوْمَ وُلِدْتُّ وَيَوْمَ أَمُوتُ وَيَوْمَ أُبْعَثُ حَيّاً,And peace from God be upon me the day I was born and the day I die and the day I shall be raised alive!’ — the same is being said about him as was said above regarding the lord John. God exalted be He says
ذٰلِكَ عِيسَى ٱبْنُ مَرْيَمَ قَوْلَ ٱلْحَقِّ ٱلَّذِي فِيهِ يَمْتُرُونَ,That is Jesus son of Mary a statement of truth read qawlu’l-haqqi as the predicate of an implied subject in other words ‘the statement of the son of Mary is a statement of truth’; or read qawla’l-haqqi because of it being the object of an implied verb qultu ‘I say’ meaning ‘I say a statement of truth’ concerning which they are in doubt yamtarūna derives from the infinitive al-mirya — they are the Christians who say ‘Indeed Jesus is the son of God’; but they lie.
مَا كَانَ للَّهِ أَن يَتَّخِذَ مِن وَلَدٍ سُبْحَانَهُ إِذَا قَضَىٰ أَمْراً فَإِنَّمَا يَقُولُ لَهُ كُن فَيَكُونُ,It is not befitting for God to take to Himself a son. Glory be to Him — in affirmation of His being transcendent above doing such a thing. When He decrees a thing that is when He will for it to happen He only says to it ‘Be!’ and it is read fa-yakūnu because of an implied pronoun huwa sc. fa-huwa yakūnu; or read fa-yakūna because of an implied an sc. an yakūna. An example of this is His creating Jesus without his having had a father.
وَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ رَبِّي وَرَبُّكُمْ فَٱعْبُدُوهُ هَـٰذَا صِرَاطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ,And indeed God is my Lord and your Lord. So worship Him read the introductory particle as anna with an implicit preceding udhkur ‘mention’; or read it as inna with an implicit preceding qul ‘say’ a reading indicated by the fact that God says elsewhere ‘I only said to them that which You commanded me “Worship God my Lord and your Lord” ’ Q. 5117. This that has been mentioned is a straight path a route leading to Paradise.
فَٱخْتَلَفَ ٱلأَحْزَابُ مِن بَيْنِهِمْ فَوَيْلٌ لِّلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِن مَّشْهَدِ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ,But the factions differed among themselves that is to say the Christians they differed regarding Jesus was he the son of God? A god alongside Him? Or was he the third of three gods? So woe — meaning severe punishment will be meted out — to those who disbelieve those who disbelieve in the way mentioned and in other ways at the scene of an awful Day that is to say woe to them when they are present at the Day of Resurrection and witnessing its terrors.
أَسْمِعْ بِهِمْ وَأَبْصِرْ يَوْمَ يَأْتُونَنَا لَـٰكِنِ ٱلظَّالِمُونَ ٱلْيَوْمَ فِي ضَلاَلٍ مُّبِينٍ,How hearing they are and seeing they are these two constructions are used to express ‘amazement’ meaning ‘how well they will hear and how well they will see’ on the Day when they come to Us in the Hereafter. Yet the evildoers an example of a proper noun ‘evildoers’ replacing a third person pronominalisation today that is in this world are in manifest error that is error that is evident therein having been deaf unable to listen to the truth and blind unable to see it. In other words the meaning is O you the one being addressed marvel at how well they will be able to hear and see in the Hereafter after they had been deaf and blind in this world.
وَأَنْذِرْهُمْ يَوْمَ ٱلْحَسْرَةِ إِذْ قُضِيَ ٱلأَمْرُ وَهُمْ فِي غَفْلَةٍ وَهُمْ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ,And warn them threaten O Muhammad (s) the disbelievers of Mecca of the Day of Regret namely the Day of Resurrection on which the sinner will regret not having been virtuous in the life of this world when the matter will be decided for them thereupon that they be chastised while they in this world are yet heedless of it and do not believe in it the Day of Resurrection.
إِنَّا نَحْنُ نَرِثُ ٱلأَرْضَ وَمَنْ عَلَيْهَا وَإِلَيْنَا يُرْجَعُونَ,Indeed We innā nahnu a repetition of the first person for emphasis shall inherit the earth and all who are on it of rational beings and others by destroying them and to Us they shall be returned thereon on the Day of Resurrection for requital.
وَٱذْكُرْ فِي ٱلْكِتَابِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ إِنَّهُ كَانَ صِدِّيقاً نَّبِيّاً,And mention to them in the Book Abraham that is mention his tale. Indeed he was a truthful one the intensive form siddīq means ‘extremely truthful’ a prophet the following statement substitutes for the preceding predicate.
إِذْ قَالَ لأَبِيهِ يٰأَبَتِ لِمَ تَعْبُدُ مَا لاَ يَسْمَعُ وَلاَ يُبْصِرُ وَلاَ يُغْنِي عَنكَ شَيْئاً,When he said to his father Āzar ‘O my father! the final tā’ here of abati has replaced the possessive yā’ of genitive annexation sc. of yā abī; the two however are never used together — he Abraham’s father used to worship idols. Why do you worship that which neither hears nor sees and is of no avail to you suffices you not in any way? whether in terms of benefit or harm.
يٰأَبَتِ إِنِّي قَدْ جَآءَنِي مِنَ ٱلْعِلْمِ مَا لَمْ يَأْتِكَ فَٱتَّبِعْنِيۤ أَهْدِكَ صِرَاطاً سَوِيّاً,O my father! Indeed there has come to me of knowledge that which has not come to you. So follow me that I may guide you to a path a route that is right that is straight.
يٰأَبَتِ لاَ تَعْبُدِ ٱلشَّيْطَانَ إِنَّ ٱلشَّيْطَانَ كَانَ لِلرَّحْمَـٰنِ عَصِيّاً,O my father! Do not worship Satan by obeying him through your worship of idols. Truly Satan is disobedient the intensive form‘asiyyan means ‘one given to disobedience’ to the Compassionate One.
يٰأَبَتِ إِنِّيۤ أَخَافُ أَن يَمَسَّكَ عَذَابٌ مِّنَ ٱلرَّحْمَـٰنِ فَتَكُونَ لِلشَّيْطَانِ وَلِيّاً,O my father! I do fear lest a chastisement from the Compassionate One should befall you if you do not repent and then you become an ally of Satan an assistant and a comrade of his in the Fire.
قَالَ أَرَاغِبٌ أَنتَ عَنْ آلِهَتِي يٰإِبْرَاهِيمُ لَئِن لَّمْ تَنتَهِ لأَرْجُمَنَّكَ وَٱهْجُرْنِي مَلِيّاً,He said ‘Are you renouncing my gods O Abraham? so that you are denouncing them in this way? If you do not desist from criticising them I shall surely assail you with stones or with evil words so beware of me; and stay away from me for a long time’.
قَالَ سَلاَمٌ عَلَيْكَ سَأَسْتَغْفِرُ لَكَ رَبِّيۤ إِنَّهُ كَانَ بِي حَفِيّاً,He said ‘Peace be to you from me — in other words I shall not cause you any harm. I shall ask forgiveness of my Lord for you. Truly He is ever gracious to me hafiyyan from hafiyyun meaning bārrun ‘kind’ answering my prayers. And indeed he Abraham fulfilled his above-mentioned promise as described in sūrat al-Shu‘arā’ And forgive my father Q. 2686; but this was before it became clear to him that he Abraham’s father was an enemy of God as mentioned in sūrat Barā’a Q. 9114.
وَأَعْتَزِلُكُمْ وَمَا تَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ وَأَدْعُو رَبِّي عَسَىۤ أَلاَّ أَكُونَ بِدُعَآءِ رَبِّي شَقِيّاً,And I shall shun you and that which you call upon that which you worship besides God. I will supplicate I will worship my Lord — hopefully in calling upon in worshipping my Lord I shall not be wretched’ as you have become wretched by your worship of idols.
فَلَمَّا ٱعْتَزَلَهُمْ وَمَا يَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ وَهَبْنَا لَهُ إِسْحَاقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ وَكُلاًّ جَعَلْنَا نَبِيّاً,And so after he had shunned them and that which they worshipped besides God by having set off to the Holy Land We gave him two sons for him to find solace in Isaac and Jacob and each of the two We made a prophet.
وَوَهَبْنَا لَهْم مِّن رَّحْمَتِنَا وَجَعَلْنَا لَهُمْ لِسَانَ صِدْقٍ عَلِيّاً,And We gave them all three of them out of Our mercy wealth and offspring and We assigned for them a worthy repute one that is lofty sublime namely We assigned fair praise of them among all the members of the Abrahamic religions.
وَٱذْكُرْ فِي ٱلْكِتَابِ مُوسَىٰ إِنَّهُ كَانَ مُخْلِصاً وَكَانَ رَسُولاً نَّبِيّاً,And mention in the Book Moses. Indeed he was devoted to God read either as mukhlisan to mean ‘one sincerely devoted to worship of God’; or read mukhlasan to mean ‘he was delivered’ as in God had delivered him from defilement and he was a messenger a prophet.
وَنَادَيْنَاهُ مِن جَانِبِ ٱلطُّورِ ٱلأَيْمَنِ وَقَرَّبْنَاهُ نَجِيّاً,And We called him — with the words ‘O Moses! Verily I am God’ Q. 279 — from the right side of the Mount al-Tūr is actually the name of a mountain that is from the side to the right of Moses as he was approaching the Mount from Midian; and We brought him near in communion as God exalted be He made him hear His speech.
وَوَهَبْنَا لَهُ مِن رَّحْمَتِنَآ أَخَاهُ هَارُونَ نَبِيّاً,And We gave him out of Our mercy Our grace his brother Aaron Hārūn either a substitution for akhāhu ‘his brother’ or an explicative supplement thereof likewise a prophet nabiyyan a circumstantial qualifier constituting the import of the ‘gift’ to Moses which was in response to his Moses’s request that He God send forth his brother with him; he Aaron was older in years than him.
وَٱذْكُرْ فِي ٱلْكِتَابِ إِسْمَاعِيلَ إِنَّهُ كَانَ صَادِقَ ٱلْوَعْدِ وَكَانَ رَسُولاً نَّبِيّاً,And mention in the Book Ishmael. Indeed he was true to his promise — he never promised anything which he did not fulfil; he once waited for three days for someone whom he had promised to meet; or it is said that he waited an entire year until that person finally returned to the place in which he Ishamel was supposed to have met the former; and he was a messenger to the tribe of Jurhum a prophet likewise.
وَكَانَ يَأْمُرُ أَهْلَهُ بِٱلصَّـلاَةِ وَٱلزَّكَـاةِ وَكَانَ عِندَ رَبِّهِ مَرْضِيّاً,He used to enjoin upon his kinsfolk that is his people prayer and the payment of alms and he was pleasing to his Lord mardiyyan ‘pleasing’ is actually marduwwun but both wāw letters have been changed to two yā’ letters while the kasra vowel has also been changed to a damma vowel.
وَٱذْكُرْ فِي ٱلْكِتَابِ إِدْرِيسَ إِنَّهُ كَانَ صِدِّيقاً نَّبِيَّاً,And mention in the Book Idrīs who was Noah’s great-grandfather. Indeed he was a truthful one a prophet.
وَرَفَعْنَاهُ مَكَاناً عَلِيّاً,And We raised him to a high station — he is alive in the fourth or sixth or seventh heaven or he is in Paradise into which he was admitted after he was made to experience death and brought back to life and he has not exited therefrom.
أُولَـٰئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ أَنْعَمَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْهِم مِّنَ ٱلنَّبِيِّيْنَ مِن ذُرِّيَّةِ ءَادَمَ وَمِمَّنْ حَمَلْنَا مَعَ نُوحٍ وَمِن ذُرِّيَّةِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَإِسْرَائِيلَ وَمِمَّنْ هَدَيْنَا وَٱجْتَبَيْنَآ إِذَا تُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْهِمْ آيَاتُ ٱلرَّحْمَـٰنِ خَرُّواْ سُجَّداً وَبُكِيّاً,Those ūlā’ika is the subject to whom God has been gracious alladhīna an‘ama’Llāhu ‘alayhim is an adjectival qualification of it of the subject from among the prophets mina’l-nabīyyīna an explication of it of the subject functioning like an adjectival qualification in terms of import. That which follows it mina’l-nabīyyīna ‘from among the prophets’ up to where the conditional sentence begins constitutes an adjectival qualification of al-nabīyyīna ‘the prophets’; and so His saying … of the seed of Adam namely Idrīs and of those whom We carried with Noah in the Ark namely Abraham — who is the son of his Noah’s son Shem Sām — and of the seed of Abraham namely Ishmael Isaac and Jacob and of the seed of Israel — who is Jacob — namely Moses Aaron Zachariah John and Jesus and from among those whom We guided and chose that is to say from among their number the predicate of ūlā’ika ‘those’ is the following idhā tutlā … when the signs of the Compassionate One were recited to them they would fall down prostrating and weeping these sujjadan and bukīyyan constitute the plural forms of sājid ‘prostrate’ and bākin ‘weeping’ respectively in other words what is meant is be you like them bukiyyun is originally formed from bakūyyin but the wāw is changed into a yā’ and the damma vowel into a kasra.
فَخَلَفَ مِن بَعْدِهِمْ خَلْفٌ أَضَاعُواْ ٱلصَّلَٰوةَ وَٱتَّبَعُواْ ٱلشَّهَوَٰتِ فَسَوْفَ يَلْقَونَ غَيّاً,But there succeeded after them a posterity who neglected the prayer by abandoning performance of it a posterity such as the Jews and the Christians and followed their lusts in the way of acts of disobedience. So they shall soon encounter Ghayy — a valley in Hell — that is they shall fall into it;
إِلاَّ مَن تَابَ وَآمَنَ وَعَمِلَ صَالِحاً فَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ يَدْخُلُونَ ٱلْجَنَّةَ وَلاَ يُظْلَمُونَ شَيْئاً,whereas those who repent and believe and act righteously — such shall enter Paradise and shall not be wronged they shall not be diminished in any way in their reward;
جَنَّاتِ عَدْنٍ ٱلَّتِي وَعَدَ ٱلرَّحْمَـٰنُ عِبَادَهُ بِٱلْغَيْبِ إِنَّهُ كَانَ وَعْدُهُ مَأْتِيّاً,they shall enter Gardens of Eden as a place of residence jannāti ‘Adnin substitutes for al-janna ‘Paradise’ which the Compassionate One has promised to His servants a promise in the Unseen bi’l-ghaybi a circumstantial qualifier in other words a promise made while they do not see it. Indeed His promise that is to say that which He promises is ever fulfilled meaning that it always arrives the original form of ma’tiyyan is ma’tūyun; or what is meant by His promise here is Paradise to which those deserving of it shall arrive.
لاَّ يَسْمَعُونَ فِيهَا لَغْواً إِلاَّ سَلاَماً وَلَهُمْ رِزْقُهُمْ فِيهَا بُكْرَةً وَعَشِيّاً,Therein they shall not hear anything that is trifling of talk but they shall hear only a greeting of ‘Peace!’ from the angels to them or from some among them to others. And therein they will have their provision morning and evening in other words according to the equivalent measure of these two in the life of this world since there is no day or night in Paradise only everlasting light and illumination.
تِلْكَ ٱلْجَنَّةُ ٱلَّتِي نُورِثُ مِنْ عِبَادِنَا مَن كَانَ تَقِيّاً,That is the Paradise which We shall give as inheritance which We shall grant and in which We shall lodge those of Our servants who are God-fearing through their obedience of Him.
وَمَا نَتَنَزَّلُ إِلاَّ بِأَمْرِ رَبِّكَ لَهُ مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِينَا وَمَا خَلْفَنَا وَمَا بَيْنَ ذٰلِكَ وَمَا كَانَ رَبُّكَ نَسِيّاً,When the Revelation did not come for a number of days the Prophet s said to Gabriel ‘What prevents you from visiting us more often than you do?’ and so the following was revealed And We do not descend except by the commandment of your Lord. To Him belongs all that is before us namely ahead of us of the affairs of the Hereafter and all that is behind us of the affairs of this world and all that is between those two namely all that takes place from this point in time until the coming of the Hour in other words to Him belongs knowledge of all of those things. And your Lord is never forgetful meaning that He is never neglectful of you even when the Revelation is postponed from being sent to you.
رَّبُّ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا فَٱعْبُدْهُ وَٱصْطَبِرْ لِعِبَادَتِهِ هَلْ تَعْلَمُ لَهُ سَمِيّاً,He is the Lord the Owner of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them. So worship Him and be steadfast in His worship in other words continue to perform it patiently. Do you know of anyone who could be His namesake? anyone named with that same title? No!
وَيَقُولُ ٱلإِنسَانُ أَءِذَا مَا مِتُّ لَسَوْفَ أُخْرَجُ حَيّاً,And man the denier of the Resurrection — namely Ubayy b. Khalaf or al-Walīd b. al-Mughīra concerning whom the verse was revealed — says ‘When read a-idha either pronouncing the second hamza or not but inserting an alif between the two hamzas in both readings I am dead shall I then be brought forth alive?’ from the grave as Muhammad (s) says? the interrogative here statement is meant as a denial in other words he means to say I shall not be brought forth alive after death; mā of mā mittu ‘I am dead’ is extra for emphasis likewise extra is the lām of la-sawfa ‘shall I then’. He God then responds to him with the following saying of His exalted be He
أَوَلاَ يَذْكُرُ ٱلإِنسَٰنُ أَنَّا خَلَقْنَاهُ مِن قَبْلُ وَلَمْ يَكُ شَيْئاً,Does not man then remember yadhdhakaru is actually yatadhakkaru but the tā’ has been changed to a dhāl and assimilated with the other dhāl; a variant reading leaves it as yadhkuru that We created him before when he was nothing? and thus infer from the first act of creation the possibility of resurrection.
فَوَرَبِّكَ لَنَحْشُرَنَّهُمْ وَٱلشَّيَاطِينَ ثُمَّ لَنُحْضِرَنَّهُمْ حَوْلَ جَهَنَّمَ جِثِيّاً,For by your Lord We will surely gather them namely the deniers of the Resurrection and the devils that is to say We shall gather every one of them with his devil bound together in a chain; then We shall bring them around Hell around the outside of it crouching on their knees jithiyyan is the plural of jāthin and is originally formed as jathawuwwin or jathawiyyun deriving from the verb jathā imperfect tense yajthu or yajthī two variant forms.
ثُمَّ لَنَنزِعَنَّ مِن كُلِّ شِيعَةٍ أَيُّهُمْ أَشَدُّ عَلَى ٱلرَّحْمَـٰنِ عِتِيّاً,Then We shall pluck out from every party every sect whichever of them was most hardened in disdain in insolence of the Compassionate One.
ثُمَّ لَنَحْنُ أَعْلَمُ بِٱلَّذِينَ هُمْ أَوْلَىٰ بِهَا صِلِيّاً,Then indeed We shall know best those most deserving of it most worthy of being in Hell the most hardened of them and others like them for the burning for the admission into it and the scorching therein and We shall start with them siliyyan is originally formed as salawiyyun from the verb saliya or salaya.
وَإِن مِّنكُمْ إِلاَّ وَارِدُهَا كَانَ عَلَىٰ رَبِّكَ حَتْماً مَّقْضِيّاً,There is not one of you but shall come to it that is but shall enter Hell. That is an inevitability already decreed by your Lord something which He made inevitable and which He decreed; He will not waive it.
ثُمَّ نُنَجِّي ٱلَّذِينَ ٱتَّقَواْ وَّنَذَرُ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ فِيهَا جِثِيّاً,Then We will deliver read nunajjī or nunjī those who were wary of committing idolatry or disbelief We will deliver them from it and leave those who did wrong by way of idolatry and disbelief crouching therein on their knees.
وَإِذَا تُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْهِمْ آيَاتُنَا بَيِّنَٰتٍ قَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لِلَّذِينَ آمَنُوۤاْ أَيُّ ٱلْفَرِيقَيْنِ خَيْرٌ مَّقَاماً وَأَحْسَنُ نَدِيّاً,And when Our manifest evident bayyinātin ‘manifest’ is a circumstantial qualifier signs in the Qur’ān are recited to them namely to the believers and the disbelievers those who disbelieve say to those who believe ‘Which of the two parties — us or you — is better in station in lodging and abode read as maqāman it is derived from the first form qāma ‘he stood’; read as muqāman it is derived from the fourth form aqāma ‘he took up residence’ and more excellent in assembly?’ nadiyyan meaning the place in which a folk assemble and converse. They the disbelievers mean ‘we are the better of the two parties’ and so we will fare better than you. God exalted be He says
وَكَمْ أَهْلَكْنَا قَبْلَهُمْ مِّن قَرْنٍ هُمْ أَحْسَنُ أَثَاثاً وَرِءْياً,And how many — in other words many — a generation that is a community from among the communities of the past have We destroyed before them who were superior in their possession of gear in wealth and chattel and in appearance superior as a sight ri’yan derives from the infinitive al-ru’ya. Thus in the same way that We destroyed those ones because of their disbelief We will destroy these ones also.
قُلْ مَن كَانَ فِي ٱلضَّلَـٰلَةِ فَلْيَمْدُدْ لَهُ ٱلرَّحْمَـٰنُ مَدّاً حَتَّىٰ إِذَا رَأَوْاْ مَا يُوعَدُونَ إِمَّا ٱلعَذَابَ وَإِمَّا ٱلسَّاعَةَ فَسَيَعْلَمُونَ مَنْ هُوَ شَرٌّ مَّكَاناً وَأَضْعَفُ جُنداً,Say ‘As for him who is in error man kāna fī’l-dalālati a conditional clause the response to which is fa’l-yamdud ‘He shall prolong’ and what follows it the Compassionate One shall defer fa’l-yamdud functions in the sense of a predicate him from chastisement by granting him some respite in this world drawing him on to his eventual chastisement gradually until when they catch sight of that which they were promised whether it be chastisement in this world by being killed or taken captive or the Hour the Resurrection that comprises Hell they will enter it. Then they will surely know who is worse in respect of position and weaker in respect of the number of hosts’ in respect of the number of supporters themselves or the believers? Their hosts will be the devils while the hosts of the believers against them will be the angels.
وَيَزِيدُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱهْتَدَواْ هُدًى وَٱلْبَاقِيَاتُ ٱلصَّالِحَاتُ خَيْرٌ عِندَ رَبِّكَ ثَوَاباً وَخَيْرٌ مَّرَدّاً,And God increases in guidance those who found right guidance through faith increasing them by way of the signs He reveals to them; and the enduring things the righteous deeds — namely obedience the reward of which endures for that person — are better in your Lord’s sight in terms of reward and better in terms of the return that is as something which will be repaid and returned to him the believer in contrast to the deeds of the disbelievers. The use of the qualification khayr ‘better’ here is meant to counter the use of the same in their statement ‘Which of the two parties is better in station?’ above Q. 1973.
أَفَرَأَيْتَ ٱلَّذِي كَفَرَ بِآيَاتِنَا وَقَالَ لأُوتَيَنَّ مَالاً وَوَلَداً,Have you seen him who disbelieves in Our signs namely al-‘Ās b. Wā’il and says to Khabbāb b. al-Aratt — who had said to him ‘You will be resurrected after death!’ and who had requested from him repayment of money — ‘I shall assuredly be given on the supposition that there is such a thing as resurrection wealth and children?’ and so I will repay you then. God exalted be He says
أَطَّلَعَ ٱلْغَيْبَ أَمِ ٱتَّخَذَ عِندَ ٱلرَّحْمَـٰنِ عَهْداً,Has he come to learn something of the Unseen that is has he been given some knowledge of it and of the fact that he will be given what he has mentioned here the interrogative hamza of a-ittala‘a ‘has he come to learn?’ suffices in place of the conjunctive hamza which has therefore been omitted or has he made a covenant with the Compassionate One? to the effect that he be given what he claims?
كَلاَّ سَنَكْتُبُ مَا يَقُولُ وَنَمُدُّ لَهُ مِنَ ٱلْعَذَابِ مَدّاً,Nay he shall not be given any of that but We will assuredly write down We shall command that it be written down that which he says and prolong for him the chastisement endlessly We shall give him because of that claim an extra chastisement in addition to the chastisement for his disbelief;
وَنَرِثُهُ مَا يَقُولُ وَيَأْتِينَا فَرْداً,and We shall take over from him that which he talks about of wealth and children and he shall come to Us on the Day of Resurrection alone with neither wealth nor children.
وَٱتَّخَذُواْ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ آلِهَةً لِّيَكُونُواْ لَهُمْ عِزّاً,And they namely the disbelievers of Mecca have taken besides God graven images as other gods for them to worship that they may be for them a source of might that they may be intercessors before God so that they will not be chastised.
كَلاَّ سَيَكْفُرُونَ بِعِبَادَتِهِمْ وَيَكُونُونَ عَلَيْهِمْ ضِدّاً,Nay that is to say there is none to prevent their being chastised but they namely the idol gods shall reject their worship that is they will deny it — as is stated in another verse It was not us that they used to worship Q. 2863 — and they shall be pitted against them as opponents enemies supporting one another against them.
أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّآ أَرْسَلْنَا ٱلشَّيَاطِينَ عَلَى ٱلْكَافِرِينَ تَؤُزُّهُمْ أَزّاً,Have you not regarded that We unleash the devils against We have set them upon the disbelievers to urge them to incite them to commit acts of disobedience impetuously?
فَلاَ تَعْجَلْ عَلَيْهِمْ إِنَّمَا نَعُدُّ لَهُمْ عَدّاً,So do not make haste against them to demand that they receive chastisement. Indeed We are only counting for them the days and the nights or their every breath carefully until the time arrives for their chastisement.
يَوْمَ نَحْشُرُ ٱلْمُتَّقِينَ إِلَى ٱلرَّحْمَـٰنِ وَفْداً,Mention the day on which We shall gather those who fear God by their adherence to faith to the Compassionate One honoured on mounts wafdan the accusative plural of wāfid meaning ‘mounted’;
وَنَسُوقُ ٱلْمُجْرِمِينَ إِلَىٰ جَهَنَّمَ وِرْداً,and drive the guilty guilty on account of their disbelief into Hell a thirsty herd wirdan the accusative plural of wārid meaning ‘one who is thirsty and on foot.
لاَّ يَمْلِكُونَ ٱلشَّفَاعَةَ إِلاَّ مَنِ ٱتَّخَذَ عِندَ ٱلرَّحْمَـٰنِ عَهْداً,They namely mankind will not have the power to intercede save him who has made a covenant with the Compassionate One the covenant being the profession of lā ilāha illā’Llāh wa-lā hawla wa-lā quwwata illā bi’Llāh ‘there is no god but God and there is no power or strength except in God’.
وَقَالُواْ ٱتَّخَذَ ٱلرَّحْمَـٰنُ وَلَداً,And they say that is the Jews and the Christians and those who claim that the angels are God’s daughters ‘The Compassionate One has taken a son’. But God exalted be He says to them
لَّقَدْ جِئْتُمْ شَيْئاً إِدّاً,Truly you have uttered something hideous that is a great abomination.
تَكَادُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتُ يَتَفَطَّرْنَ مِنْهُ وَتَنشَقُّ ٱلأَرْضُ وَتَخِرُّ ٱلْجِبَالُ هَدّاً,The heavens are almost read takādu or yakādu rent read takādu tatafattarna by being torn apart a variant reading has yanfatirna because of it and the earth is almost split asunder and the mountains almost fall down crashing collapsing on top of them because of the fact
أَن دَعَوْا لِلرَّحْمَـٰنِ وَلَداً,that they have ascribed a son to the Compassionate One. God exalted be He says
وَمَا يَنبَغِي لِلرَّحْمَـٰنِ أَن يَتَّخِذَ وَلَداً,when it is not meet for the Majesty of the Compassionate One to take a son that is to say such a thing does not befit Him.
إِن كُلُّ مَن فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ إِلاَّ آتِي ٱلرَّحْمَـٰنِ عَبْداً,There is none in the heavens and the earth but he comes to the Compassionate One as a servant servile submissive on the Day of Resurrection including individuals such as Ezra and Jesus.
لَّقَدْ أَحْصَاهُمْ وَعَدَّهُمْ عَدّاً,Verily He knows their number and has counted them precisely and therefore the knowledge of their total number does not elude Him not even the knowledge of one of them.
وَكُلُّهُمْ آتِيهِ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ فَرْداً,And each one of them will come to Him on the Day of Resurrection each one alone without wealth or any helper to protect him.
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ سَيَجْعَلُ لَهُمُ ٱلرَّحْمَـٰنُ وُدّاً,Truly those who believe and perform righteous deeds — for them the Compassionate One shall appoint love between them so that they have mutual love and affection and God exalted be He will love them.
فَإِنَّمَا يَسَّرْنَاهُ بِلِسَانِكَ لِتُبَشِّرَ بِهِ ٱلْمُتَّقِينَ وَتُنْذِرَ بِهِ قَوْماً لُّدّاً,Indeed We have made it easy namely the Qur’ān in your tongue only that you may bear good tidings therewith to the God-fearing those who will be prosperous because of their faith and warn threaten therewith a folk who are contumacious luddan the accusative plural of aladd in other words extremely disputatious using false arguments — and they are the disbelievers of Mecca.
وَكَمْ أَهْلَكْنَا قَبْلَهُمْ مِّن قَرْنٍ هَلْ تُحِسُّ مِنْهُمْ مِّنْ أَحَدٍ أَوْ تَسْمَعُ لَهُمْ رِكْزاً,And how many — in other words many — a generation namely how many a community from among the communities of the past We have destroyed before them for their denial of Our messengers. Can you see can you find so much as one of them or hear from them so much as the faintest sound? No indeed! So just as We destroyed those folk We shall destroy these Meccans.
طه,Tā hā God knows best what He means by these letters.
مَآ أَنَزَلْنَا عَلَيْكَ ٱلْقُرْآنَ لِتَشْقَىٰ,We have not revealed the Qur’ān to you O Muhammad (s) that you should be miserable that you should toil because of what you used to do after it was revealed to you in the way of long vigils performing night prayers; in other words so unburden your soul;
إِلاَّ تَذْكِرَةً لِّمَن يَخْشَىٰ,but We have revealed it only to remind therewith him who fears God;
تَنزِيلاً مِّمَّنْ خَلَقَ ٱلأَرْضَ وَٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ ٱلْعُلَى,a revelation tanzīlan a substitution standing in place of the conjugated verb derived therefrom which renders it tanzīlan accusative from Him Who created the earth and the high heavens ‘ulā the plural of ‘ulyā similar in pattern to kubrā kubar ‘large’;

وَهَلْ أَتَاكَ حَدِيثُ مُوسَىٰ,Has the story of Moses — indeed it has — come to you?
إِذْ رَأَى نَاراً فَقَالَ لأَهْلِهِ ٱمْكُثُوۤاْ إِنِّيۤ آنَسْتُ نَاراً لَّعَلِّيۤ آتِيكُمْ مِّنْهَا بِقَبَسٍ أَوْ أَجِدُ عَلَى ٱلنَّارِ هُدًى,When he caught sight of a fire and said to his family namely to his wife ‘Wait here! — this was when he was leaving Midian heading for Egypt — Indeed I see a fire in the distance. Perhaps I can bring you a brand from it bring you a burning wick or a torch or find at the fire some guidance’ that is someone to guide me by showing me the proper route — for he had lost it in the darkness of the night. He Moses said ‘perhaps’ la‘alla because he could not be certain of fulfilling his promise.
فَلَمَّآ أَتَاهَا نُودِيَ يٰمُوسَىٰ,And when he reached it — it was a boxthorn — he was called by name ‘O Moses!
إِنِّيۤ أَنَاْ رَبُّكَ فَٱخْلَعْ نَعْلَيْكَ إِنَّكَ بِٱلْوَادِ ٱلْمُقَدَّسِ طُوًى,Indeed read as innī if one understands nūdiya ‘he was called’ as meaning qīla ‘it was said’; or read it as annī because of an implied prefixed bā’ I am anā reiterates the first person indicator yā’ of innī used by the direct speaker your Lord. So take off your sandals for lo! you are in the holy meaning either the pure or the blessed valley of Tuwā this is either a substitution or an explicative supplement; read Tuwan with nunation or Tuwā without it is considered declinable on account of it being a location; but alternatively considered indeclinable if taken as considered a feminine proper noun denoting a place name.
وَأَنَا ٱخْتَرْتُكَ فَٱسْتَمِعْ لِمَا يُوحَىۤ,And I Myself have chosen you from among all of your people so listen to what is being revealed to you from Me.
إِنَّنِيۤ أَنَا ٱللَّهُ لاۤ إِلَـٰهَ إِلاۤ أَنَاْ فَٱعْبُدْنِي وَأَقِمِ ٱلصَّلاَةَ لِذِكْرِيۤ,Verily I am God — there is no god except Me. So worship Me and establish prayer for to make remembrance of Me in it.

But I will to keep it hidden from mankind — and its nearness in time will manifest itself to them through its signs — so that every soul may be requited thereupon for what it strives for of good or evil.

وَمَا تِلْكَ بِيَمِينِكَ يٰمُوسَىٰ,And what is that that happens to be in your right hand O Moses?’ the interrogative is meant as an affirmative but it is expressed as an interrogative in order that the miracle to be manifested in it be shown as consequent upon it.
قَالَ هِيَ عَصَايَ أَتَوَكَّأُ عَلَيْهَا وَأَهُشُّ بِهَا عَلَىٰ غَنَمِي وَلِيَ فِيهَا مَآرِبُ أُخْرَىٰ,He said ‘It is my staff. I lean I support myself upon it when I leap across something or walk and I beat down leaves I strike the leaves on trees with it so that they fall for my sheep which then consume them; and I have uses for it ma’ārib ‘uses’ is the plural of ma’ruba with the rā’ taking any one of the three vowels sc. ma’ruba ma’raba or ma’riba meaning ‘needs’ in other ways such as using it to carry food supplies and waterskins as well as to drive away undesirable animals. He Moses gives an extensive response to indicate his many needs for it.
قَالَ أَلْقِهَا يٰمُوسَىٰ,He said ‘Cast it down O Moses!’
فَأَلْقَاهَا فَإِذَا هِيَ حَيَّةٌ تَسْعَىٰ,And he cast it down and lo! it was a serpent a giant snake moving swiftly moving about on its belly swiftly with the speed of a small snake — which is called al-jānn and which is also used to refer to this serpent in another verse Q. 2710; Q. 2831.
قَالَ خُذْهَا وَلاَ تَخَفْ سَنُعِيدُهَا سِيرَتَهَا ٱلأُولَىٰ,He said ‘Take hold of it and do not fear it. We will restore it to its former state sīratahā in the accusative because the genitive-operating preposition has been removed. And so he placed his hand in its mouth and it became a staff once again; and it became clear that the place into which he put his hand was the place where it the staff is held between its two prongs. Moses was shown this miracle lest he be terrified when it turns into a snake in the presence of Pharaoh.
وَٱضْمُمْ يَدَكَ إِلَىٰ جَنَاحِكَ تَخْرُجْ بَيْضَآءَ مِنْ غَيْرِ سُوۤءٍ آيَةً أُخْرَىٰ,And thrust your hand the right one meaning the palm into your flank — that is your left side below the arm into the armpit and then take it out — it will emerge white in contrast to the skin-colour that it was without any fault that is without any sign of leprosy radiating like the rays of the sun blinding to the eyes of onlookers. That is yet another sign āyatan ukhrā this together with baydā’a ‘white’ constitute two circumstantial qualifiers referring to the subject of the verb takhruj ‘it will emerge’.
لِنُرِيَكَ مِنْ آيَاتِنَا ٱلْكُبْرَىٰ,That We may show you thereby when you do this as described above in order to manifest it of Our greatest signs the sign that is the greatest proof of the truth of your Mission from God and should he want it to be restored to its former state he would thrust it into his armpit as has been mentioned and then bring it out.
ٱذْهَبْ إِلَىٰ فِرْعَوْنَ إِنَّهُ طَغَىٰ,Go as a messenger from God to Pharaoh and to those with him. He has indeed transgressed’ he has exceeded the usual limits in his disbelief by claiming to be a god.
قَالَ رَبِّ ٱشْرَحْ لِي صَدْرِي,He said ‘My Lord expand my breast for me expand it so that it may accommodate the weight of the Divine Message.
وَيَسِّرْ لِيۤ أَمْرِي,And make easy facilitate for me my affair that I may deliver it.
وَٱحْلُلْ عُقْدَةً مِّن لِّسَانِي,And undo the knot upon my tongue — the result of his having been burnt by a live coal which he had placed accidentally in his mouth as a child;
يَفْقَهُواْ قَوْلِي,so that they may understand what I shall say when I am delivering the Message.
وَٱجْعَل لِّي وَزِيراً مِّنْ أَهْلِي,And appoint for me a minister an assistant for that task from my family
هَارُونَ أَخِي,Aaron Hārūna constitutes the second object my brother akhī an explicative supplement.
ٱشْدُدْ بِهِ أَزْرِي,Confirm through him my strength my courage;
وَأَشْرِكْهُ فِيۤ أَمْرِي,and let him share in my affair namely in the delivery of the Message both verbs ushdud ‘confirm’ and ashrikhu ‘let him share’ are in the imperative and in the apocopated imperfect tense constituting the response to the request of Moses.
كَيْ نُسَبِّحَكَ كَثِيراً,So that we may glorify You by making glorifications over and over again
وَنَذْكُرَكَ كَثِيراً,and remember You by making remembrance over and over again.
إِنَّكَ كُنتَ بِنَا بَصِيراً,Indeed You are ever Seeing of us’ ever Knowing having been gracious to us by way of appointing us to deliver the Message.
قَالَ قَدْ أُوتِيتَ سُؤْلَكَ يٰمُوسَىٰ,He said ‘You have been granted your request O Moses! as a favour from Us to you.
وَلَقَدْ مَنَنَّا عَلَيْكَ مَرَّةً أُخْرَىٰ,And certainly We have done you a favour already another time
إِذْ أَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَىٰ أُمِّكَ مَا يُوحَىٰ,when idh for explanation of that favour We revealed to your mother either in her sleep or by way of inspiration — when she gave birth to you and feared that Pharaoh would have you slain for being one of the newborn of the Children of Israel — that which was revealed regarding your affair this mā yūhā ‘that which was revealed’ is substituted by what follows an iqdhifīhi …
أَنِ ٱقْذِفِيهِ فِي ٱلتَّابُوتِ فَٱقْذِفِيهِ فِي ٱلْيَمِّ فَلْيُلْقِهِ ٱلْيَمُّ بِٱلسَّاحِلِ يَأْخُذْهُ عَدُوٌّ لِّي وَعَدُوٌّ لَّهُ وَأَلْقَيْتُ عَلَيْكَ مَحَبَّةً مِّنِّي وَلِتُصْنَعَ عَلَىٰ عَيْنِيۤ,“Cast him place him in the ark then cast him while in the ark into the river into the flow of the Nile and then the river shall throw him up onto the shore that is its bank the imperative here fa’l-yulqihi ‘let it throw him’ functions as a predicate; there an enemy of Mine and an enemy of his namely Pharaoh shall take him”. And after he took you I cast upon you love from Me that you may be loved by people; and indeed Pharaoh and all who saw you loved you; and that you might be reared under My eyes be nurtured under My guardianship and My protection of you.
إِذْ تَمْشِيۤ أُخْتُكَ فَتَقُولُ هَلْ أَدُلُّكُمْ عَلَىٰ مَن يَكْفُلُهُ فَرَجَعْنَاكَ إِلَىٰ أُمِّكَ كَيْ تَقَرَّ عَيْنُها وَلاَ تَحْزَنَ وَقَتَلْتَ نَفْساً فَنَجَّيْنَاكَ مِنَ ٱلْغَمِّ وَفَتَنَّاكَ فُتُوناً فَلَبِثْتَ سِنِينَ فِيۤ أَهْلِ مَدْيَنَ ثُمَّ جِئْتَ عَلَىٰ قَدَرٍ يٰمُوسَىٰ,When idh for explanation your sister Maryam walked up to obtain news of you for they had brought wet nurses for you but you would not take to the breast of any of them and she then said “Shall I show you someone who will take care of him?”. Her offer was accepted and so she brought them his mother and he took to her breasts. Thus We restored you to your mother that her eyes might rejoice in seeing you again and not grieve at that point anymore. Then you slew a soul namely the Copt in Egypt — and you became distressed for having slain him because of how Pharaoh would react; whereupon We delivered you from great distress and We tried you with various ordeals We tested you by landing you in some other ordeal and again delivered you from it. Then you stayed for several years ten years among the people of Midian after you had reached it having left Egypt staying with the prophet Shu‘ayb and marrying his daughter. Then you came hither as ordained in My knowledge with the Message that you will deliver — and this was when you were forty years old O Moses!
وَٱصْطَنَعْتُكَ لِنَفْسِي,And I chose you for Myself to deliver the Message.
ٱذْهَبْ أَنتَ وَأَخُوكَ بِآيَاتِي وَلاَ تَنِيَا فِي ذِكْرِي,Go you and your brother to the people with My nine signs and do not flag be remiss in remembrance of Me by uttering glorifications and otherwise.
ٱذْهَبَآ إِلَىٰ فِرْعَوْنَ إِنَّهُ طَغَىٰ,Go the two of you to Pharaoh. Truly he has transgressed the bounds in claiming to be the Lord.
فَقُولاَ لَهُ قَوْلاً لَّيِّناً لَّعَلَّهُ يَتَذَكَّرُ أَوْ يَخْشَىٰ,And speak to him gentle words for him to renounce such claims that perhaps he may be mindful be admonished or fear’ God and so repent — the ‘hope’ for Pharaoh’s repentance is expressed from their perspective for God knows that he was not going to repent.
قَالاَ رَبَّنَآ إِنَّنَا نَخَافُ أَن يَفْرُطَ عَلَيْنَآ أَوْ أَن يَطْغَىٰ,The two of them said ‘Our Lord We truly fear that he may forestall us that is by hastening to punish us or become tyrannical’ against us that is be high-handed with us.
قَالَ لاَ تَخَافَآ إِنَّنِي مَعَكُمَآ أَسْمَعُ وَأَرَىٰ,He said ‘Do not fear for I shall be with the two of you by providing you with My assistance hearing what he says and seeing what he does.
فَأْتِيَاهُ فَقُولاۤ إِنَّا رَسُولاَ رَبِّكَ فَأَرْسِلْ مَعَنَا بَنِيۤ إِسْرَائِيلَ وَلاَ تُعَذِّبْهُمْ قَدْ جِئْنَاكَ بِآيَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّكَ وَٱلسَّلاَمُ عَلَىٰ مَنِ ٱتَّبَعَ ٱلْهُدَىٰ,So go to him and say “Truly we are two messengers of your Lord so let the Children of Israel go with us to Syria and do not continue to chastise them in other words release them from your exploitation of them in those oppressive works of yours such as digging construction and the lifting of heavy objects. We have verily brought you a sign a definitive argument from your Lord as proof of our truthfulness in delivering the Message; and may peace be upon him who follows right guidance that is to say may he be secure from God’s chastisement.
إِنَّا قَدْ أُوحِيَ إِلَيْنَآ أَنَّ ٱلْعَذَابَ عَلَىٰ مَن كَذَّبَ وَتَوَلَّىٰ,Indeed it has been revealed to us that the chastisement shall befall him who denies the truth of what we have brought and turns away” ’ and who rejects it. And so they came to him and said to him all of what has been mentioned.
قَالَ فَمَن رَّبُّكُمَا يٰمُوسَىٰ,He said ‘So who is your Lord O Moses?’ — he Pharaoh restricted this question to him Moses because between him and Aaron he is the principal bearer of God’s Message and also because of his Pharaoh’s having pampered him while he was being reared as a child.
قَالَ رَبُّنَا ٱلَّذِيۤ أَعْطَىٰ كُلَّ شَيءٍ خَلْقَهُ ثُمَّ هَدَىٰ,He said ‘Our Lord is He Who gave to everything in creation its peculiar nature through which it is distinguished from another thing and then guided it’ the animal among them to its source of food drink and procreation and in other ways.
قَالَ فَمَا بَالُ ٱلْقُرُونِ ٱلأُولَىٰ,He Pharaoh said ‘So what of the status of the generations the communities of old?’ such as the people of Noah Hūd Lot and Sālih with regard to their having worshipped graven images.
قَالَ عِلْمُهَا عِندَ رَبِّي فِي كِتَابٍ لاَّ يَضِلُّ رَبِّي وَلاَ يَنسَى,Said he Moses ‘The knowledge thereof that is the knowledge of their otherworldly status is preserved with my Lord in a Book namely the Preserved Tablet al-lawh al-mahfūz and He shall requite them in accordance with it on the Day of Resurrection. My Lord does not err He is never absent from anything nor does He my Lord forget anything.
ٱلَّذِي جَعَلَ لَكُمُ ٱلأَرْضَ مَهْداً وَسَلَكَ لَكُمْ فِيهَا سُبُلاً وَأَنزَلَ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مَآءً فَأَخْرَجْنَا بِهِ أَزْوَاجاً مِّن نَّبَاتٍ شَتَّىٰ,He is the One Who made for you as well as for all creatures the earth a cradle a bed and threaded facilitated for you therein ways roads and sent down from the heaven water rain. God exalted be He says as a complement to Moses’s description of Him and as an address to the people of Mecca and therewith We brought forth various kinds species of plants shattā ‘various’ adjectivally qualifies azwājan ‘kinds’ in other words plants of different colours flavours and different in other ways shattā is the plural of shatīt similar in pattern to marīd plural mardā as may be used in a phrase like shatta al-amr ‘the affair has become divided’.
كُلُواْ وَٱرْعَوْا أَنْعَامَكُمْ إِنَّ فِي ذٰلِكَ لآيَاتٍ لأُوْلِي ٱلنُّهَىٰ,Eat thereof and pasture your cattle therein an‘ām ‘cattle’ is the plural of na‘am which are camels cows and sheep; one says ra‘atu’l-an‘āmu ‘the cattle grazed’ or ra‘aytuhā ‘I grazed them’; the imperative here is meant as a permissive and a reminder of God’s grace the sentence being a circumstantial qualifier referring to the subject of the verb akhrajnā ‘We brought forth’ in other words what is meant is ‘We brought forth the plants permitting you to eat thereof and to graze your cattle thereon’. In that which is mentioned here there are indeed signs indeed lessons for people of sense possessors of intellect al-nuhā the plural of nuhya similar in pattern to ghurfa plural ghuraf. The intellect is called by this term nuhya because it shows a person the sense to refrain from committing vile deeds.
مِنْهَا خَلَقْنَاكُمْ وَفِيهَا نُعِيدُكُمْ وَمِنْهَا نُخْرِجُكُمْ تَارَةً أُخْرَىٰ,From it that is from the earth We created you by creating your father Adam from it and into it We shall restore you when you are interred after death and from it We shall bring you forth at the Resurrection a second time’ in the same way that We brought you forth from it when We initiated your creation.
وَلَقَدْ أَرَيْنَاهُ آيَاتِنَا كُلَّهَا فَكَذَّبَ وَأَبَىٰ,And verily We showed him that is We made Pharaoh see all Our signs all nine but he denied them and claimed that they were the result of sorcery and refused to affirm the Oneness of God exalted be He.
قَالَ أَجِئْتَنَا لِتُخْرِجَنَا مِنْ أَرْضِنَا بِسِحْرِكَ يٰمُوسَىٰ,He said ‘Have you come to us so that you may expel us from our land Egypt and so that kingship over it may be yours by your sorcery O Moses?
فَلَنَأْتِيَنَّكَ بِسِحْرٍ مِّثْلِهِ فَٱجْعَلْ بَيْنَنَا وَبَيْنَكَ مَوْعِداً لاَّ نُخْلِفُهُ نَحْنُ وَلاَ أَنتَ مَكَاناً سُوًى,Yet We too shall produce for you a sorcery like it one which will counter it. So fix a tryst between us and you for that purpose a tryst which neither we nor you shall fail to keep at a place makānan is in the accusative because the genitive-operator preposition fī ‘at’ has been removed of equal distance read siwān or suwān in other words in the middle equidistant for a person coming from either side.
قَالَ مَوْعِدُكُمْ يَوْمُ ٱلزِّينَةِ وَأَن يُحْشَرَ ٱلنَّاسُ ضُحًى,Said he Moses ‘Your tryst shall be the Day of Adornment — a festive day of theirs on which they adorn themselves and the public assemble — and let the people assemble let the inhabitants of Egypt gather at forenoon’ the time for this tryst to observe what will transpire.
فَتَوَلَّىٰ فِرْعَوْنُ فَجَمَعَ كَيْدَهُ ثُمَّ أَتَىٰ,Then Pharaoh withdrew retreated and summoned up his guile that is to say those human elements of his guile from among the sorcerers and then came with them to the tryst.
قَالَ لَهُمْ مُّوسَىٰ وَيْلَكُمْ لاَ تَفْتَرُواْ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ كَذِباً فَيُسْحِتَكُم بِعَذَابٍ وَقَدْ خَابَ مَنِ ٱفْتَرَىٰ,Moses said to them — and there were 72 of them each with a rope and a staff in his hand — ‘Woe to you! meaning may God make you liable to woe. Do not invent a lie against God by ascribing partners to Him lest He annihilate you read fa-yushitakum or fa-yashatakum by some chastisement from Him. For verily he who invents lies against God fails’ he is the loser.
فَتَنَازَعُوۤاْ أَمْرَهُمْ بَيْنَهُمْ وَأَسَرُّواْ ٱلنَّجْوَىٰ,So they disputed their matter among themselves regarding Moses and his brother and kept secret their private counsel that is their conversation regarding the two
قَالُوۤاْ إِنْ هَـٰذَانِ لَسَاحِرَانِ يُرِيدَانِ أَن يُخْرِجَاكُمْ مِّنْ أَرْضِكُمْ بِسِحْرِهِمَا وَيَذْهَبَا بِطَرِيقَتِكُمُ ٱلْمُثْلَىٰ,They said to each other ‘These two men hādhān this form concords with the forms used by those grammarians who use the alif ending for all three cases of the dual person; Abū ‘Amr has the variant reading hādhayn are indeed sorcerers who intend to expel you from your land by their sorcery and do away with your excellent traditions muthlā the feminine form of amthal meaning ‘the noblest’ in other words they will do away with the loyalty of the noblemen among you because these latter will prefer the two of them Moses and Aaron on account of their triumph.
فَأَجْمِعُواْ كَيْدَكُمْ ثُمَّ ٱئْتُواْ صَفّاً وَقَدْ أَفْلَحَ ٱلْيَوْمَ مَنِ ٱسْتَعْلَىٰ,So summon up your guile in the way of sorcery read fa’jma‘ū from the first form jama‘a meaning ‘he gathered’ or read fa-ajmi‘ū from the fourth form ajma‘a meaning ‘he resolved to do something’ and come in battle-line saffan a circumstantial qualifier meaning ‘standing in rows’. For truly he who is uppermost he who triumphs this day shall be the victor!’
قَالُواْ يٰمُوسَىٰ إِمَّآ أَن تُلْقِيَ وَإِمَّآ أَن نَّكُونَ أَوَّلَ مَنْ أَلْقَىٰ,They said ‘O Moses you choose either cast your staff first or we shall be the first to cast’ their staff.
قَالَ بَلْ أَلْقُواْ فَإِذَا حِبَالُهُمْ وَعِصِيُّهُمْ يُخَيَّلُ إِلَيْهِ مِن سِحْرِهِمْ أَنَّهَا تَسْعَىٰ,He said ‘Nay you cast!’ and so they cast and lo! their ropes and their staffs ‘isiyyihim derives from ‘isūwwun but the two wāw letters have been changed into two yā’ letters with the kasra vowelling applied to both the ‘ayn and the sād appeared to him by the effect of their sorcery as though they were snakes gliding swiftly on their bellies.
فَأَوْجَسَ فِي نَفْسِهِ خِيفَةً مُّوسَىٰ,And Moses sensed fear within himself that is to say he feared that if the effect of their sorcery was of the same kind as his miracle he would become suspect in people’s minds and they would not believe in him.
قُلْنَا لاَ تَخَفْ إِنَّكَ أَنتَ ٱلأَعْلَىٰ,We said to him ‘Do not be afraid! Indeed you shall have the upper hand over them by triumphing.
وَأَلْقِ مَا فِي يَمِينِكَ تَلْقَفْ مَا صَنَعُوۤاْ إِنَّمَا صَنَعُواْ كَيْدُ سَاحِرٍ وَلاَ يُفْلِحُ ٱلسَّاحِرُ حَيْثُ أَتَىٰ,And cast that which is in your right hand — and this was his staff. It shall swallow up that which they have produced. For what they have produced is only a sorcerer’s trick that is to say a kind thereof and the sorcerer does not succeed wherever he may go’ in his sorcery. So Moses cast his staff and it swallowed up all of that which they had produced.
فَأُلْقِيَ ٱلسَّحَرَةُ سُجَّداً قَالُوۤاْ آمَنَّا بِرَبِّ هَارُونَ وَمُوسَىٰ,Thereat the sorcerers cast their heads down prostrating they fell down prostrating to God exalted be He They said ‘We now believe in the Lord of Aaron and Moses’.
قَالَ آمَنتُمْ لَهُ قَبْلَ أَنْ ءَاذَنَ لَكُمْ إِنَّهُ لَكَبِيرُكُمُ ٱلَّذِي عَلَّمَكُمُ ٱلسِّحْرَ فَلأُقَطِّعَنَّ أَيْدِيَكُمْ وَأَرْجُلَكُمْ مِّنْ خِلاَفٍ وَلأُصَلِّبَنَّكُمْ فِي جُذُوعِ ٱلنَّخْلِ وَلَتَعْلَمُنَّ أَيُّنَآ أَشَدُّ عَذَاباً وَأَبْقَىٰ,Said he Pharaoh ‘Do you profess belief read a-āmantum pronouncing both hamzas or with the second changed to an alif in him before I myself give you permission? He is indeed your chief your teacher who taught you sorcery. I shall assuredly cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides min khilāfin a circumstantial qualifier meaning ‘alternate hands and feet’ in other words the right hands and the left feet and I shall assuredly crucify you on the trunks of palm trees. And you shall then know which of us — meaning himself and the Lord of Moses — is harsher in inflicting chastisement and which of us is more lasting’ more enduring in sustaining opposition to him Moses.
قَالُواْ لَن نُّؤْثِرَكَ عَلَىٰ مَا جَآءَنَا مِنَ ٱلْبَيِّنَاتِ وَٱلَّذِي فَطَرَنَا فَٱقْضِ مَآ أَنتَ قَاضٍ إِنَّمَا تَقْضِي هَـٰذِهِ ٱلْحَيَاةَ ٱلدُّنْيَآ,They said ‘We will not choose you over what has come to us of clear signs proving the truthfulness of Moses and over Him Who originated us created us wa’lladhī fatarana either an oath or a supplement to the preceding mā ‘what’. Decree what you will decree that is do what you say. What you decree is only relevant in the life of this world al-hayāta’l-dunyā is in the accusative because the scope of his decree is being indicated in other words ‘you can only decree in it’; yet you will be requited for it in the Hereafter.
إِنَّآ آمَنَّا بِرَبِّنَا لِيَغْفِرَ لَنَا خَطَايَانَا وَمَآ أَكْرَهْتَنَا عَلَيْهِ مِنَ ٱلسِّحْرِ وَٱللَّهُ خَيْرٌ وَأَبْقَىٰ,Indeed We profess belief in our Lord that He may forgive us our sins in the way of ascribing partners to God and otherwise and the sorcery to which you forced us to learn and to perform in order to oppose Moses. And God is better than you in rewarding if he is obeyed and more enduring’ than you in chastisement if he is disobeyed.
إِنَّهُ مَن يَأْتِ رَبَّهُ مُجْرِماً فَإِنَّ لَهُ جَهَنَّمَ لاَ يَمُوتُ فِيهَا وَلاَ يَحْيَىٰ,God exalted be He says Truly whoever comes to his Lord a criminal a disbeliever like Pharaoh for him there shall be Hell wherein he shall neither die and thus find rest nor live a life of any benefit to him.
وَمَن يَأْتِهِ مُؤْمِناً قَدْ عَمِلَ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ فَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ لَهُمُ ٱلدَّرَجَاتُ ٱلْعُلَىٰ,And whoever comes to Him a believer having performed righteous deeds — the obligatory and supererogatory deeds for such shall be the highest degrees al-‘ulā the plural of ‘ulyā the feminine form of a‘lā —
جَنَّاتُ عَدْنٍ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلأَنْهَارُ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا وَذٰلِكَ جَزَآءُ مَن تَزَكَّىٰ,the Gardens of Eden that is to say as a place of residence this jannātu ‘Adnin ‘Gardens of Eden’ is an explication thereof of al-darajātu’l-‘ulā ‘the highest degrees’ underneath which rivers flow abiding therein and that is the reward of him who keeps pure of sins.
وَلَقَدْ أَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَىٰ مُوسَىٰ أَنْ أَسْرِ بِعِبَادِي فَٱضْرِبْ لَهُمْ طَرِيقاً فِي ٱلْبَحْرِ يَبَساً لاَّ تَخَافُ دَرَكاً وَلاَ تَخْشَىٰ,And verily We revealed to Moses saying ‘Lead My servants on a journey by night read as an asri ‘that lead on a journey by night’ from fourth form asrā ‘he travelled by night’; or read as an’isri from first form sarā ‘he travelled by night’ both being alternative forms in other words travel with them by night from the land of Egypt and strike for them make for them by striking your staff a dry path in the sea. So he fulfilled what he had been commanded and God made the ground dry so that they were able to pass through it. Do not fear to be overtaken that is fearing that Pharaoh might catch you and do not be afraid’ of drowning.
فَأَتْبَعَهُمْ فِرْعَوْنُ بِجُنُودِهِ فَغَشِيَهُمْ مِّنَ ٱلْيَمِّ مَا غَشِيَهُمْ,Then Pharaoh pursued them with his hosts with him Pharaoh alongside them and there engulfed them what did engulf them of the sea and it drowned them.
وَأَضَلَّ فِرْعَوْنُ قَوْمَهُ وَمَا هَدَىٰ,And Pharaoh led his people astray by calling them to worship him and he did not guide them nay he led them to destruction in contrast to what he said to them and I guide you only to the path of rectitude Q. 4029.
يٰبَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ قَدْ أَنجَيْنَاكُمْ مِّنْ عَدُوِّكُمْ وَوَاعَدْنَاكُمْ جَانِبَ ٱلطُّورِ ٱلأَيْمَنَ وَنَزَّلْنَا عَلَيْكُمُ ٱلْمَنَّ وَٱلسَّلْوَىٰ,O Children of Israel truly We delivered you from your enemy Pharaoh by drowning him and We made a tryst with you on the right side of the Tūr Mount in order to give Moses the Torah that it may be implemented it by you and We sent down to you manna and quails namely turunjabīn citrus fruit and the quail. The ones being addressed in the vocative by ‘O Children of Israel’ are those Jews living at the time of the Prophet s and they are addressed with reference to the graces which God bestowed on their forefathers at the time of the prophet Moses as a preface to what God now says to them
كُلُواْ مِن طَيِّبَاتِ مَا رَزَقْنَاكُمْ وَلاَ تَطْغَوْاْ فِيهِ فَيَحِلَّ عَلَيْكُمْ غَضَبِي وَمَن يَحْلِلْ عَلَيْهِ غَضَبِي فَقَدْ هَوَىٰ,‘Eat of the good things We have provided you that is to say of that which has been bestowed on you as a grace from God but do not transgress regarding it by being ungrateful for the grace thereof lest My wrath descend on you if read fa-yahilla it means ‘lest it My wrath become incumbent upon you’; or if read fa-yuhilla it means ‘lest it descend on you’. And he on whom My wrath descends read yahlil ‘becomes incumbent’ or yahlul ‘descends’ certainly perishes falls into the Fire.
وَإِنِّي لَغَفَّارٌ لِّمَن تَابَ وَآمَنَ وَعَمِلَ صَالِحَاً ثُمَّ ٱهْتَدَىٰ,And indeed I am Forgiving toward him who repents from ascribing partners to God and believes affirms God’s Oneness and acts righteously is sincere in performing the obligatory and the supererogatory deeds and then follows guidance’ by adhering to what has been mentioned up to his death.
وَمَآ أَعْجَلَكَ عَن قَومِكَ يٰمُوسَىٰ,‘And what has hurried you to depart from your people in order to come to the appointed time to receive the Torah O Moses?’
قَالَ هُمْ أُوْلاۤءِ عَلَىٰ أَثَرِي وَعَجِلْتُ إِلَيْكَ رَبِّ لِتَرْضَىٰ,He said ‘They are close behind me coming upon my track and I hastened to You my Lord that You may be pleased’ with me in other words to please you even more — before giving the response he gives an excuse according to what he supposed was the situation with his people
قَالَ فَإِنَّا قَدْ فَتَنَّا قَوْمَكَ مِن بَعْدِكَ وَأَضَلَّهُمُ ٱلسَّامِرِيُّ,But those he supposed to be following him had remained behind for He exalted be He said ‘Indeed We tried your people after you that is after your departure from them and the Samaritan led them astray’ so they took to worshipping the golden calf.
فَرَجَعَ مُوسَىٰ إِلَىٰ قَوْمِهِ غَضْبَٰنَ أَسِفاً قَالَ يٰقَوْمِ أَلَمْ يَعِدْكُمْ رَبُّكُمْ وَعْداً حَسَناً أَفَطَالَ عَلَيْكُمُ ٱلْعَهْدُ أَمْ أَرَدتُّمْ أَن يَحِلَّ عَلَيْكُمْ غَضَبٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ فَأَخْلَفْتُمْ مَّوْعِدِي,Thereupon Moses returned to his people angry with them and sad extremely grieved. He said ‘O my people did not your Lord promise you a fair promise? that is a true promise that He will give you the Torah? Did the period the length of my absence from you seem too long for you or did you desire that wrath should become incumbent against you from your Lord by your worship of the golden calf and so you broke your tryst with me?’ and failed to follow after me?
قَالُواْ مَآ أَخْلَفْنَا مَوْعِدَكَ بِمَلْكِنَا وَلَـٰكِنَّا حُمِّلْنَآ أَوْزَاراً مِّن زِينَةِ ٱلْقَوْمِ فَقَذَفْنَاهَا فَكَذَلِكَ أَلْقَى ٱلسَّامِرِيُّ,They said ‘We did not break our tryst with you of our own accord read the mīm with any of the three vowellings meaning ‘by our own power’ or ‘of our own will’ but we were laden with read hamalnā ‘we carried’ or hummilnā ‘we were made to carry’ the burdens the weight of the people’s ornaments of the trinkets of Pharaoh’s folk — which the Children of Israel had borrowed from them on the pretext of using them for a wedding but which had remained with them — and we cast them we threw them into the fire at the command of the Samaritan and so just as We cast did the Samaritan cast what he had on him of their trinkets together with the dust that he took from the track left by the hoof of Gabriel’s steed as follows
فَأَخْرَجَ لَهُمْ عِجْلاً جَسَداً لَّهُ خُوَارٌ فَقَالُواْ هَـٰذَآ إِلَـٰهُكُمْ وَإِلَـٰهُ مُوسَىٰ فَنَسِيَ,Then he produced for them a calf which he fashioned from the melted trinkets — a mere body of flesh and blood with a low in other words it made a sound that was audible; it was transformed into such a state because of the dust from Gabriel’s steed the effect of which is to create life in whatever thing it is placed. After he had fashioned it he placed it the dust in its mouth. And they namely the Samaritan and his followers said ‘This is your God and the God of Moses so he Moses forgot’ his Lord here and set off in search of him. God exalted be He says
أَفَلاَ يَرَوْنَ أَلاَّ يَرْجِعُ إِلَيْهِمْ قَوْلاً وَلاَ يَمْلِكُ لَهُمْ ضَرّاً وَلاَ نَفْعاً,Did they not see that in allā an has been softened in place of the hardened form with its subject omitted in other words it should be annahu it the Calf did not reciprocate their words that is that it did not give them any response in return nor did it have any power over hurt for them that is any power to prevent it or any benefit? that is any power to procure it for them in other words how can such a thing be taken as a god?
وَلَقَدْ قَالَ لَهُمْ هَارُونُ مِن قَبْلُ يٰقَوْمِ إِنَّمَا فُتِنتُمْ بِهِ وَإِنَّ رَبَّكُمُ ٱلرَّحْمَـٰنُ فَٱتَّبِعُونِي وَأَطِيعُوۤاْ أَمْرِي,And Aaron had certainly said to them beforehand that is before the return of Moses ‘O my people you are only being tested thereby! But truly your Lord is the Compassionate One so follow me in worship of Him and obey my command’ therein.
قَالُواْ لَن نَّبْرَحَ عَلَيْهِ عَاكِفِينَ حَتَّىٰ يَرْجِعَ إِلَيْنَا مُوسَىٰ,They said ‘We will not cease to cling to it persisting in worship of it until Moses returns to us’.
قَالَ يٰهَرُونُ مَا مَنَعَكَ إِذْ رَأَيْتَهُمْ ضَلُّوۤاْ,He Moses said upon his return ‘O Aaron what held you back when you saw them going astray by worshipping it
أَلاَّ تَتَّبِعَنِ أَفَعَصَيْتَ أَمْرِي,that allā read an instead the lā being extra you did not follow me? Did you then disobey my command?’ by remaining among those who worship something other than God exalted be He?
قَالَ يَبْنَؤُمَّ لاَ تَأْخُذْ بِلِحْيَتِي وَلاَ بِرَأْسِي إِنِّي خَشِيتُ أَن تَقُولَ فَرَّقْتَ بَيْنَ بَنِيۤ إِسْرَآءِيلَ وَلَمْ تَرْقُبْ قَوْلِي,He Aaron said ‘O son of my mother read ya’bna’ummi or ya’bna’umma meaning ummī ‘my mother’ the mention of her is more effective in provoking the affection of his heart — do not clutch my beard which he had seized with his left hand or my head! for he had seized his hair with his right hand in anger. Indeed I feared that if I followed you for inevitably a group of those who did not worship the calf would have followed me you would have said “You have caused division among the Children of Israel — and have been furious with me — and you did not wait for my word”’ concerning what my opinion would have been in this matter.
قَالَ فَمَا خَطْبُكَ يٰسَامِرِيُّ,He said ‘And what have you to say what was the motive for doing what you did O Samaritan?’
قَالَ بَصُرْتُ بِمَا لَمْ يَبْصُرُواْ بِهِ فَقَبَضْتُ قَبْضَةً مِّنْ أَثَرِ ٱلرَّسُولِ فَنَبَذْتُهَا وَكَذٰلِكَ سَوَّلَتْ لِي نَفْسِي,He said ‘I perceived what they did not perceive read either as third person plural yabsurū or as second person plural tabsurū ‘what you did not perceive’ in other words I realised what they did not realise so I seized a handful of dust from the track of from the hoof of the steed of the messenger Gabriel and threw it in I cast it onto the figure of the calf that had been fashioned. Thus my soul prompted thus it adorned for me’ and it was cast into me the idea that I seize a handful of the dust from that mentioned hoof and cast it onto what possessed no spirit so that it might thus acquire a spirit. I had seen that your people had asked that you make for them a god and so my soul suggested to me the idea that this calf should be their god.
قَالَ فَٱذْهَبْ فَإِنَّ لَكَ فِي ٱلْحَيَاةِ أَن تَقُولَ لاَ مِسَاسَ وَإِنَّ لَكَ مَوْعِداً لَّن تُخْلَفَهُ وَٱنظُرْ إِلَىٰ إِلَـٰهِكَ ٱلَّذِي ظَلْتَ عَلَيْهِ عَاكِفاً لَّنُحَرِّقَنَّهُ ثُمَّ لَنَنسِفَنَّهُ فِي ٱلْيَمِّ نَسْفاً,Said he Moses to him ‘Begone! It shall be yours as your lot throughout life that is for the duration of your life to say to whomever you may see “Do not touch me!” that is do not come near me — he used to wander about aimlessly throughout the land and whenever he touched a person or a person touched him both would succumb to a fever. And indeed there will be a tryst for you for you to be chastised which you will not fail to keep read lan tukhlifahu meaning ‘a tryst which you shall not miss’; or lan tukhlafahu ‘for which you will not be forgotten’ meaning ‘nay you will be sent forth to keep it’. Now look at your god to whom you remained clinging! zalta is actually zalilta but the first lām has been omitted in order to soften it that is to say you remained by his your god’s side worshipping him. We will surely burn it in fire and then scatter the ashes of it into the waters we will disperse it into the winds of the sea; and after having slaughtered it Moses did exactly that which he has mentioned.
إِنَّمَآ إِلَـٰهُكُمُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِي لاۤ إِلَـٰهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ وَسِعَ كُلَّ شَيْءٍ عِلْماً,Indeed your God is the One God than whom there is no other god. He embraces all things in His knowledge’ ‘ilman a specification derived from the subject of the verb in other words it means ‘His knowledge embraces all things’.
كَذٰلِكَ نَقُصُّ عَلَيْكَ مِنْ أَنْبَآءِ مَا قَدْ سَبَقَ وَقَدْ آتَيْنَاكَ مِن لَّدُنَّا ذِكْراً,Thus just as We have related to you O Muhammad (s) this story We relate to you some stories some accounts of what is past of communities and We have given you from Ourselves a Reminder a Qur’ān.
مَّنْ أَعْرَضَ عَنْهُ فَإِنَّهُ يَحْمِلُ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ وِزْراً,Whoever turns away from it and does not believe in it he shall indeed on the Day of Resurrection bear a burden a heavy load of sin;
خَالِدِينَ فِيهِ وَسَآءَ لَهُمْ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ حِمْلاً,therein that is in the chastisement for such sin abiding. And evil for them on the Day of Resurrection is that burden! himlan a specification qualifying the person of the verb sā’a ‘evil’; the subject of derision the implied wizruhum ‘their sin’ has been omitted; the lām of lahum is explicative and substitutes for yawma’l-qiyāma ‘the Day of Resurrection.
يَوْمَ يُنفَخُ فِي ٱلصُّورِ وَنَحْشُرُ ٱلْمُجْرِمِينَ يَوْمِئِذٍ زُرْقاً,The day the Trumpet is blown the Horn the Second Blast and We shall assemble the criminals the disbelievers on that day bruised in the eye along with their faces blackened.
يَتَخَافَتُونَ بَيْنَهُمْ إِن لَّبِثْتُمْ إِلاَّ عَشْراً,They will whisper to one another speaking secretly amongst themselves ‘You have tarried in this world only ten nights’ with the full ten days.
نَّحْنُ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا يَقُولُونَ إِذْ يَقُولُ أَمْثَلُهُمْ طَرِيقَةً إِن لَّبِثْتُمْ إِلاَّ يَوْماً,We know very well what they will say regarding this matter — that is it is not as they say — when the justest the most upright of them in the way in this will say ‘You have tarried only a day’ they will deem their stay in this world as having been very brief on account of the terrors they will witness in the Hereafter.
وَيَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ ٱلْجِبَالِ فَقُلْ يَنسِفُهَا رَبِّي نَسْفاً,They will question you concerning the mountains how will they be on the Day of Resurrection? Say to them ‘My Lord will scatter them as ashes by pulverising them into moving sand and dispersing them with the wind;
فَيَذَرُهَا قَاعاً صَفْصَفاً,then He will leave them a level hollow a flattened level surface
لاَّ تَرَىٰ فِيهَا عِوَجاً وَلاۤ أَمْتاً,wherein you will see neither crookedness neither slope nor any curving’ nor any rise.
يَوْمَئِذٍ يَتَّبِعُونَ ٱلدَّاعِيَ لاَ عِوَجَ لَهُ وَخَشَعَتِ ٱلأَصْوَاتُ لِلرَّحْمَـٰنِ فَلاَ تَسْمَعُ إِلاَّ هَمْساً,On that day that is on the day the mountains are scattered as ashes they will follow that is mankind will follow after rising from their graves the Summoner to the Gathering by the call of his voice — this Summoner will be the archangel Isrāfīl and he will say ‘Forward to the parade before God!’ — there will be no deviation therein that is in the manner in which they follow him in other words they cannot but follow him. Voices will be hushed will become silent before the Compassionate One so that you hear nothing but a faint shuffle the light tread of feet walking towards the Gathering similar to the sound of the hoofs of camels as they pass.
يَوْمَئِذٍ لاَّ تَنفَعُ ٱلشَّفَاعَةُ إِلاَّ مَنْ أَذِنَ لَهُ ٱلرَّحْمَـٰنُ وَرَضِيَ لَهُ قَوْلاً,On that day intercession will not profit anyone except intercession from him whom the Compassionate One permits that he intercede for such a person and whose word He approves that is to say because such an intercessor will say ‘there is no god but God’ lā ilāha illā’Llāh.
يَعْلَمُ مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ وَلاَ يُحِيطُونَ بِهِ عِلْماً,He knows what is before them of the affairs of the Hereafter and behind them of the affairs of this world and they do not comprehend such things in knowledge they have no knowledge of such things.
وَعَنَتِ ٱلْوُجُوهُ لِلْحَيِّ ٱلْقَيُّومِ وَقَدْ خَابَ مَنْ حَمَلَ ظُلْماً,And faces shall be humbled they shall be submissive before the Living the Eternal Sustainer namely God; and he will certainly have failed he will have lost he who carries the burden of evildoing that is of idolatry.
وَمَن يَعْمَلْ مِنَ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ وَهُوَ مُؤْمِنٌ فَلاَ يَخَافُ ظُلْماً وَلاَ هَضْماً,But whoever does righteous deeds acts of obedience being a believer shall fear neither wrong by having his evil deeds increased nor injustice by having his good deeds diminished.
وَكَذٰلِكَ أَنزَلْنَاهُ قُرْآناً عَرَبِيّاً وَصَرَّفْنَا فِيهِ مِنَ ٱلْوَعِيدِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَّقُونَ أَوْ يُحْدِثُ لَهُمْ ذِكْراً,Thus kadhālika a supplement to the previous kadhālika naqussu ‘thus We relate’ Q. 2099 just as We have revealed what has been mentioned We have revealed it that is the Qur’ān as an Arabic Qur’ān and We have distributed We have repeated in it statements of threats so that they may fear associating others with God or it the Qur’ān may arouse in them a remembrance of the destruction of those communities before and may thus be admonished.
فَتَعَٰلَى ٱللَّهُ ٱلْمَلِكُ ٱلْحَقُّ وَلاَ تَعْجَلْ بِٱلْقُرْءانِ مِن قَبْلِ أَن يُقْضَىٰ إِلَيْكَ وَحْيُهُ وَقُل رَّبِّ زِدْنِي عِلْماً,So exalted be God the King the Truth above what the idolaters say. And do not hasten with the Qur’ān that is to recite it before its revelation is completed for you before Gabriel is through delivering it and say ‘My Lord increase me in knowledge’ that is knowledge of the Qur’ān thus every time something of it was revealed to him his knowledge increased because of it.
وَلَقَدْ عَهِدْنَآ إِلَىٰ ءَادَمَ مِن قَبْلُ فَنَسِيَ وَلَمْ نَجِدْ لَهُ عَزْماً,And We made a covenant with Adam We enjoined him not to eat of the tree before that is before he ate of it but he forgot he disregarded Our covenant and We did not find in him any constancy any resoluteness or patience in abiding by what We forbade him from.
وَإِذْ قُلْنَا لِلْمَلاَئِكَةِ ٱسْجُدُواْ لأَدَمَ فَسَجَدُوۤاْ إِلاَّ إِبْلِيسَ أَبَىٰ,And mention when We said to the angels ‘Prostrate before Adam’; so they prostrated except Iblīs who was the father of the jinn — he used to keep company with the angels and worship God alongside them he refused to prostrate before Adam he said ‘I am better than him’ Q. 712.
فَقُلْنَا يآءَادَمُ إِنَّ هَـٰذَا عَدُوٌّ لَّكَ وَلِزَوْجِكَ فَلاَ يُخْرِجَنَّكُمَا مِنَ ٱلْجَنَّةِ فَتَشْقَىٰ,Then We said ‘Adam indeed this is an enemy of yours and of your wife Eve read Hawwā’. So do not let him cause you both to be expelled from the Garden so that you then toil so that you then become fatigued by the toil of tillage sowing harvesting milling baking and otherwise — the statement is restricted to the mention of his Adam’s ‘toil’ because it is the man who has to strive to provide for his wife.
إِنَّ لَكَ أَلاَّ تَجُوعَ فِيهَا وَلاَ تَعْرَىٰ,It is indeed assured for you that you will neither be hungry therein nor go naked
وَأَنَّكَ لاَ تَظْمَأُ فِيهَا وَلاَ تَضْحَىٰ,And it is indeed assured for you read wa-annaka or wa-innaka as a supplement to the subject of inna sc. laka that is ‘you’ and its clause neither to be thirsty therein nor to suffer the sun’ you will not be exposed to any heat of a midday sun for there is no sun in Paradise.
فَوَسْوَسَ إِلَيْهِ ٱلشَّيْطَانُ قَالَ يٰآدَمُ هَلْ أَدُلُّكَ عَلَىٰ شَجَرَةِ ٱلْخُلْدِ وَمُلْكٍ لاَّ يَبْلَىٰ,Then Satan whispered to him saying ‘O Adam shall I guide you to the Tree of Immortality which gives everlasting life to the one who eats thereof and a kingdom that does not waste away?’ that does not perish while he remains immortal.
فَأَكَلاَ مِنْهَا فَبَدَتْ لَهُمَا سَوْءَاتُهُمَا وَطَفِقَا يَخْصِفَانِ عَلَيْهِمَا مِن وَرَقِ ٱلْجَنَّةِ وَعَصَىٰ ءَادَمُ رَبَّهُ فَغَوَىٰ,So both of them Adam and Eve ate of it and their shameful parts were exposed to them that is the front private part of each became visible to the other as well as the other’s behind — both of these parts are called saw’a ‘shame’ because its exposure ‘shames’ yasū’u that person; and they began to piece together they took to sticking onto themselves leaves of the Garden to cover themselves up therewith. And Adam disobeyed his Lord and so he erred by his eating from the tree.
ثُمَّ ٱجْتَبَاهُ رَبُّهُ فَتَابَ عَلَيْهِ وَهَدَىٰ,Thereafter his Lord chose him He brought him close to Him and relented to him He accepted his repentance and guided him that is He guided him to seek repentance regularly.
قَالَ ٱهْبِطَا مِنْهَا جَمِيعاً بَعْضُكُمْ لِبَعْضٍ عَدُوٌّ فَإِمَّا يَأْتِيَنَّكُم مِّنِّي هُدًى فَمَنِ ٱتَّبَعَ هُدَايَ فَلاَ يَضِلُّ وَلاَ يَشْقَىٰ,He said ‘Go down both of you that is Adam and Eve including all of your progeny from it from the Garden all together some of you some of the progeny being enemies of others because of some wronging others. Yet if the nūn of the conditional particle in has been assimilated with the mā which is extra there should come to you guidance from Me then whoever follows My guidance the Qur’ān shall not go astray in this world neither shall he be miserable in the Hereafter.
وَمَنْ أَعْرَضَ عَن ذِكْرِي فَإِنَّ لَهُ مَعِيشَةً ضَنكاً وَنَحْشُرُهُ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيامَةِ أَعْمَىٰ,But whoever disregards My remembrance disregards the Qur’ān and does not believe in it his shall be a straitened life read dankan with nunation a verbal noun meaning ‘straitened circumstances’. This statement has been interpreted in one hadīth to mean the punishment of the grave for the disbeliever. And on the Day of Resurrection We shall bring him to the assembly namely the one who disregards the Qur’ān blind’ blind in eyesight.
قَالَ رَبِّ لِمَ حَشَرْتَنِيۤ أَعْمَىٰ وَقَدْ كُنتُ بَصِيراً,He shall say ‘My Lord why have you brought be to the assembly blind though I used to see?’ in the world and at the raising from the grave?
قَالَ كَذٰلِكَ أَتَتْكَ آيَاتُنَا فَنَسِيتَهَا وَكَذٰلِكَ ٱلْيَوْمَ تُنْسَىٰ,He will say ‘So it the affair is. Our signs came to you but you forgot them you neglected them and did not believe in them; and so just as you forgot Our signs today you will be forgotten’ abandoned in the Fire.
وَكَذٰلِكَ نَجْزِي مَنْ أَسْرَفَ وَلَمْ يُؤْمِن بِآيَاتِ رَبِّهِ وَلَعَذَابُ ٱلآخِرَةِ أَشَدُّ وَأَبْقَىٰ,And so just as We requite him who disregards the Qur’ān We requite him who is prodigal him who associates others with God and believes not in the signs of his Lord. And the chastisement of the Hereafter is more terrible than the chastisement of the life of this world and the punishment of the grave and more enduring longer lasting.
أَفَلَمْ يَهْدِ لَهُمْ كَمْ أَهْلَكْنَا قَبْلَهُمْ مِّنَ ٱلْقُرُونِ يَمْشُونَ فِي مَسَاكِنِهِمْ إِنَّ فِي ذَلِكَ لآيَاتٍ لأُوْلِي ٱلنُّهَىٰ,Is it not a guidance has it not become clear to them to the disbelievers of Mecca how many kam is predicative and the object of the following ahlaknā We destroyed in other words Our frequent destruction before them of generations that is of past communities for denying messengers amid the ruins of whose dwelling-places they walk? yamshūna is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the person of the pronoun lahum ‘to them’ during their journeys to Syria and other places that they might thus be admonished? what has been mentioned by grammarians regarding the derivation of the verb ihlāk to be that verb that does not contain a particle referring to the object of the action of the verb as a way of preserving the original sense of the statement is acceptable. Surely in that there are signs lessons for people of sense for possessors of intellect.
وَلَوْلاَ كَلِمَةٌ سَبَقَتْ مِن رَّبِّكَ لَكَانَ لِزَاماً وَأَجَلٌ مُّسَمًّى,And but for a decree that had already preceded from your Lord that their chastisement be deferred to the Hereafter it destruction would have been an inevitability their destruction would have been necessary in this world and a specified term fixed for them ajalun musamman a supplement to the pronoun concealed in kāna ‘it would have been’ the separation of both subjects by the predicate of both serves as an emphasis.
فَٱصْبِرْ عَلَىٰ مَا يَقُولُونَ وَسَبِّحْ بِحَمْدِ رَبِّكَ قَبْلَ طُلُوعِ ٱلشَّمْسِ وَقَبْلَ غُرُوبِهَا وَمِنْ آنَآءِ ٱلْلَّيْلِ فَسَبِّحْ وَأَطْرَافَ ٱلنَّهَارِ لَعَلَّكَ تَرْضَىٰ,So be patient with what they say — this is abrogated by the ‘fighting’ verse cf. Q. 2190ff — and make glorifications pray by praising your Lord bi-hamdi rabbika is a circumstantial qualifier in other words ‘ensconced in such praise’ before the rising of the sun the morning prayer and before its setting — the afternoon prayer — and in the watches of the night during the hours thereof and make glorifications perform the sunset and the evening prayer and at either side of the day wa-atrāfa’l-nahāri a supplement to the syntactical locus of the accusative clause wa-min ānā’i ‘and in the watches’ in other words perform the noon prayer because the time for it begins at the point where the sun starts to go down which is the end side of the first half of the day and the start side of the second half of the day; that perhaps you may be pleased with the reward that you will be given.
وَلاَ تَمُدَّنَّ عَيْنَيْكَ إِلَىٰ مَا مَتَّعْنَا بِهِ أَزْوَاجاً مِّنْهُمْ زَهْرَةَ ٱلْحَيَاةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا لِنَفْتِنَهُمْ فِيهِ وَرِزْقُ رَبِّكَ خَيْرٌ وَأَبْقَىٰ,And do not extend your glance toward what We have given to some pairs certain categories among them to enjoy as the flower of the life of this world its adornment and delight that We may try them thereby to see if they transgress the bounds. And your Lord’s provision in Paradise is better than what they have been given in this world and more enduring longer lasting.
وَأْمُرْ أَهْلَكَ بِٱلصَّلاَةِ وَٱصْطَبِرْ عَلَيْهَا لاَ نَسْأَلُكَ رِزْقاً نَّحْنُ نَرْزُقُكَ وَٱلْعَاقِبَةُ لِلتَّقْوَىٰ,And bid your family to prayer and be steadfast in the maintenance of it. We do not ask of you We do not charge you with the procurement of any provision either for yourself or for anyone else. We it is Who provide you and the best sequel Paradise will be in favour of God-fearing for such people.
وَقَالُواْ لَوْلاَ يَأْتِينَا بِآيَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّهِ أَوَلَمْ تَأْتِهِمْ بَيِّنَةُ مَا فِي ٱلصُّحُفِ ٱلأُولَىٰ,And they the idolaters say ‘Why does he Muhammad (s) not bring us a sign from his Lord?’ of the sort which they request. Has there not come to them read ta’tihim or ya’tihim the clear proof the statements of what is in the former scriptures? the tales contained in the Qur’ān relating to past communities and the details of their destruction for denying the messengers?
وَلَوْ أَنَّآ أَهْلَكْنَاهُمْ بِعَذَابٍ مِّن قَبْلِهِ لَقَالُواْ رَبَّنَا لَوْلاۤ أَرْسَلْتَ إِلَيْنَا رَسُولاً فَنَتَّبِعَ آيَاتِكَ مِن قَبْلِ أَن نَّذِلَّ وَنَخْزَىٰ,Had We destroyed them with a chastisement before him before the coming of Muhammad (s) the Messenger they would have said on the Day of Resurrection ‘Our Lord if only You had sent us a messenger so that we might have followed those signs of Yours given to the messengers to convey before we were thus abased at the Resurrection and disgraced?’ in Hell.
قُلْ كُلٌّ مُّتَرَبِّصٌ فَتَرَبَّصُواْ فَسَتَعْلَمُونَ مَنْ أَصْحَابُ ٱلصِّرَاطِ ٱلسَّوِيِّ وَمَنِ ٱهْتَدَىٰ,Say to them ‘Each one of us and you is waiting to see what this affair will lead to. So wait! For you shall indeed know at the Resurrection who are the followers of the even path the straight way and who is rightly guided’ away from error us or you.
ٱقْتَرَبَ لِلنَّاسِ حِسَابُهُمْ وَهُمْ فِي غَفْلَةٍ مُّعْرِضُونَ,Nigh has drawn for mankind the people of Mecca the deniers of the Resurrection their reckoning on the Day of Resurrection yet they are heedless of it disregardful of the preparation required for it by way of embracing faith.
مَا يَأْتِيهِمْ مِّن ذِكْرٍ مِّن رَّبِّهِمْ مُّحْدَثٍ إِلاَّ ٱسْتَمَعُوهُ وَهُمْ يَلْعَبُونَ,There does not come to them any new reminder from their Lord revealed gradually in other words new words of the Qur’ān but they listen to it as they play as they engage in mockery
لاَهِيَةً قُلُوبُهُمْ وَأَسَرُّواْ ٱلنَّجْوَى ٱلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ هَلْ هَـٰذَآ إِلاَّ بَشَرٌ مِّثْلُكُمْ أَفَتَأْتُونَ ٱلسِّحْرَ وَأَنتُمْ تُبْصِرُونَ,with their hearts preoccupied heedless of its meanings. And they are secret in their conference their speech they the evildoers alladhīna zalamū a substitution for the third person plural indicator wāw of wa-asarrū’l-najwā ‘and they are secret in conference’ ‘Is this namely Muhammad (s) other than a mortal human being like yourselves? and so what he produces is mere sorcery. Will you then take to sorcery will you succumb and follow it even though you are able to see?’ even though you know that it is sorcery?
قَالَ رَبِّي يَعْلَمُ ٱلْقَوْلَ فِي ٱلسَّمَآءِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَهُوَ ٱلسَّمِيعُ ٱلْعَلِيمُ,He said to them ‘My Lord knows the words that are spoken in the heavens and the earth and He is the Hearer of what they keep secret the Knower’ of it.
بَلْ قَالُوۤاْ أَضْغَاثُ أَحْلاَمٍ بَلِ ٱفْتَرَاهُ بَلْ هُوَ شَاعِرٌ فَلْيَأْتِنَا بِآيَةٍ كَمَآ أُرْسِلَ ٱلأَوَّلُونَ,Nay bal in the three instances below effects a transition from one subject to another but they say regarding those parts of the Qur’ān he the Prophet has brought to them are ‘A muddle of nightmares a confusion of things he has seen in his sleep. Nay he has fabricated it he has invented it; nay he is a poet and what he has brought is merely poetry! So let him bring us a sign such as was sent to the ancients’ like the she-camel Sālih the staff and the glowing hand of Moses. God exalted be He says
مَآ آمَنَتْ قَبْلَهُمْ مِّن قَرْيَةٍ أَهْلَكْنَاهَآ أَفَهُمْ يُؤْمِنُونَ,No town before them ever believed — meaning none of its inhabitants — of those that We destroyed for the denial of the signs brought to them. Would they then believe? No.
وَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَا قَبْلَكَ إِلاَّ رِجَالاً نُّوحِيۤ إِلَيْهِمْ فَاسْئَلُوۤاْ أَهْلَ ٱلذِّكْرِ إِن كُنتُمْ لاَ تَعْلَمُونَ,And We sent none before you other than men to whom We revealed read nūhī or yūhā ‘to whom it is revealed’ and We sent not any angels. Ask the People of the Remembrance those with knowledge of the Torah and the Gospel if you do not know this; for they will know it. Since you are more likely to believe them than the believers are to believing Muhammad (s).
وَمَا جَعَلْنَاهُمْ جَسَداً لاَّ يَأْكُلُونَ ٱلطَّعَامَ وَمَا كَانُواْ خَالِدِينَ,And We did not make them namely the messengers bodies that did not eat food nay they eat it; and they were not immortal in this world.
ثُمَّ صَدَقْنَاهُمُ ٱلْوَعْدَ فَأَنجَيْنَاهُمْ وَمَن نَّشَآءُ وَأَهْلَكْنَا ٱلْمُسْرفِينَ,Then We fulfilled to them the promise to deliver them. So We delivered them and whomever We would of those who believed in them and We destroyed the prodigal those who denied them.
لَقَدْ أَنزَلْنَآ إِلَيْكُمْ كِتَاباً فِيهِ ذِكْرُكُمْ أَفَلاَ تَعْقِلُونَ,Now We have sent down as revelation to you O clan of Quraysh a Book in which there is the remembrance that is yours for it is in your language. Will you not understand? and so believe in it?
وَكَمْ قَصَمْنَا مِن قَرْيَةٍ كَانَتْ ظَالِمَةً وَأَنشَأْنَا بَعْدَهَا قَوْماً آخَرِينَ,And how many did We destroy of towns — meaning its inhabitants — that had been wrongdoing disbelieving and brought forth another people after it!
فَلَمَّآ أَحَسُّواْ بَأْسَنَآ إِذَا هُمْ مِّنْهَا يَرْكُضُونَ,And when they felt Our might when the inhabitants of the town sensed destruction to be near behold they ran away from it they flee hastily therefrom.
لاَ تَرْكُضُواْ وَٱرْجِعُوۤاْ إِلَىٰ مَآ أُتْرِفْتُمْ فِيهِ وَمَسَاكِنِكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُسْأَلُونَ,But the angels said to them scornfully ‘Do not run away! Return to the opulence the comforts which you were given to enjoy and your dwelling-places that perhaps you might be asked’ for something of your worldly possessions as usual.
قَالُواْ يٰوَيْلَنَآ إِنَّا كُنَّا ظَالِمِينَ,They said ‘O yā is for calling attention to something woe to us! this is our destruction! We have indeed been doing wrong’ through our disbelief.
فَمَا زَالَت تِلْكَ دَعْوَاهُمْ حَتَّىٰ جَعَلْنَاهُمْ حَصِيداً خَامِدِينَ,So that saying remained their cry which they would make and repeat until We made them as reaped crops as crops harvested with sickles when they were killed with the sword stilled dead like the stillness of fire when it is extinguished.
وَمَا خَلَقْنَا ٱلسَّمَآءَ وَٱلأَرْضَ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا لَـٰعِبِينَ,And We did not create the heaven and the earth and all that is between them playing being frivolous but to indicate Our power and to benefit Our servants.
لَوْ أَرَدْنَآ أَن نَّتَّخِذَ لَهْواً لاَّتَّخَذْنَاهُ مِن لَّدُنَّآ إِن كُنَّا فَاعِلِينَ,Had We desired to find some diversion that which provides diversion in the way of a partner or a child We would have found it with Ourselves from among the beautiful-eyed houris or angels were We to do so. But We did not do so thus We never desired it.
بَلْ نَقْذِفُ بِٱلْحَقِّ عَلَى ٱلْبَاطِلِ فَيَدْمَغُهُ فَإِذَا هُوَ زَاهِقٌ وَلَكُمُ ٱلْوَيْلُ مِمَّا تَصِفُونَ,Nay but We hurl We cast the truth faith against falsehood disbelief and it obliterates it and behold it vanishes disappears damaghahu ‘it obliterates it’ actually means ‘it struck the brain with a blow’ a blow which is fatal. And for you O disbelievers of Mecca there shall be woe severe chastisement for what you ascribe to God of mate or child.
وَلَهُ مَن فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَمَنْ عِنْدَهُ لاَ يَسْتَكْبِرُونَ عَنْ عِبَادَتِهِ وَلاَ يَسْتَحْسِرُونَ,And to Him exalted be He belongs whoever is in the heavens and the earth as possessions and those who are near Him namely the angels wa-man ‘indahu the subject the predicate of which is the following clause do not disdain to worship Him nor do they weary.
يُسَبِّحُونَ ٱلَّيلَ وَٱلنَّهَارَ لاَ يَفْتُرُونَ,They glorify Him night and day and they do not falter in it for it comes to them as naturally as breathing comes to us something which we can never be distracted from.
أَمِ ٱتَّخَذُوۤاْ آلِهَةً مِّنَ ٱلأَرْضِ هُمْ يُنشِرُونَ,Or am functions with the meaning of bal ‘nay’ to effect a transition in subject-matter; the hamza is for rhetorical denial have they chosen gods that are from the earth such as stones gold or silver who that is gods who resurrect? who bring the dead back to life? No! Indeed only one who brings the dead back to life can be God.
لَوْ كَانَ فِيهِمَآ آلِهَةٌ إِلاَّ ٱللَّهُ لَفَسَدَتَا فَسُبْحَانَ ٱللَّهِ رَبِّ ٱلْعَرْشِ عَمَّا يَصِفُونَ,Had there been in either of them that is in the heavens and the earth gods other than God that is other than Him the two would have surely deteriorated they the heavens and the earth would have deviated from their observed order because counteractive forces would exist among such gods as is usually the case when there is more than one ruler that there is counteraction and a lack of consensus regarding something. So glory be to God — an exaltation — the Lord the Creator of the Throne al-kursī above what they ascribe the disbelievers to God of His having a partner and otherwise.
لاَ يُسْأَلُ عَمَّا يَفْعَلُ وَهُمْ يُسْأَلُونَ,He shall not be questioned about what He does but they shall be questioned about their actions.
أَمِ ٱتَّخَذُواْ مِن دُونِهِ آلِهَةً قُلْ هَاتُواْ بُرْهَانَكُمْ هَـٰذَا ذِكْرُ مَن مَّعِيَ وَذِكْرُ مَن قَبْلِي بَلْ أَكْثَرُهُمْ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ ٱلْحَقَّ فَهُمْ مُّعْرِضُونَ,Or have they chosen besides Him exalted be He other than Him gods? herein is an interrogative meant as a rebuke. Say ‘Bring your proof for this — but such a thing is impossible. This is the Remembrance of those with me namely my community and that Remembrance is the Qur’ān and the Remembrance of those before me of communities namely the Torah and the Gospel and other Books of God not a single one of which contains the statement that with God there exists another god in the way that they claim — exalted be He above such a thing. Nay but most of them do not know the truth the affirmation of God’s Oneness and so they are disregardful’ of that discernment that leads to knowledge of it.
وَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رَّسُولٍ إِلاَّ نُوحِيۤ إِلَيْهِ أَنَّهُ لاۤ إِلَـٰهَ إِلاَّ أَنَاْ فَٱعْبُدُونِ,And We did not send any Messenger before you but We revealed to him read nūhī or yūhā ‘but it was revealed to him’ that ‘There is no god except Me so worship Me’ that is affirm My Oneness.
وَقَالُواْ ٱتَّخَذَ ٱلرَّحْمَـٰنُ وَلَداً سُبْحَانَهُ بَلْ عِبَادٌ مُّكْرَمُونَ,And they say ‘The Compassionate One has taken a son’ from the angels. Glory be to Him! Nay but they are merely servants who are honoured in His presence; for the very servitude of all creatures to Him is inconsistent with the attribution of any of them as progeny of His.
لاَ يَسْبِقُونَهُ بِٱلْقَوْلِ وَهُمْ بِأَمْرِهِ يَعْمَلُونَ,They do not venture to speak before Him — they only speak after He has spoken and they act according to His command that is following His issuing of it.
يَعْلَمُ مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ وَلاَ يَشْفَعُونَ إِلاَّ لِمَنِ ٱرْتَضَىٰ وَهُمْ مِّنْ خَشْيَتِهِ مُشْفِقُونَ,He knows what is before them and what is behind them that is what they have done and what they will do and they do not intercede except for him with whom He is satisfied that he be interceded for and they for awe of Him exalted be He are apprehensive fearful.
وَمَن يَقُلْ مِنْهُمْ إِنِّيۤ إِلَـٰهٌ مِّن دُونِهِ فَذٰلِكَ نَجْزِيهِ جَهَنَّمَ كَذَلِكَ نَجْزِي ٱلظَّالِمِينَ,And should any of them say ‘I am a god besides Him’ that is besides God in other words a god other than Him — and this is Iblīs who summoned others to worship his soul and commanded that it be obeyed — such a one We will requite with Hell. Thus in the same way that We requite him We requite wrong-doers idolaters.
أَوَلَمْ يَرَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوۤاْ أَنَّ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضَ كَانَتَا رَتْقاً فَفَتَقْنَاهُمَا وَجَعَلْنَا مِنَ ٱلْمَآءِ كُلَّ شَيْءٍ حَيٍّ أَفَلاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ,Have they not one may read a-wa-lam or a-lam realised have they not come to know those who disbelieve that the heavens and the earth were closed together and then We parted them We made seven heavens and seven earths — or it is meant that the heaven was parted and began to rain when it did not use to do so and that the earth was parted and began to produce plants when it did not use to do so; and We made of water the water that falls from the heaven and that springs from the earth every living thing? in the way of plants and otherwise in other words water is the cause of such things having life. Will they not then believe? by affirming My Oneness?
وَجَعَلْنَا فِي ٱلأَرْضِ رَوَاسِيَ أَن تَمِيدَ بِهِمْ وَجَعَلْنَا فِيهَا فِجَاجاً سُبُلاً لَّعَلَّهُمْ يَهْتَدُونَ,And We set in the earth firm mountains lest it should shake with them and We set in them in the firm mountains ravines as roads subulan substitutes for fijājan ‘ravines’ which are wide through-routes that perhaps they may be guided to their destinations during travel.
وَجَعَلْنَا ٱلسَّمَآءَ سَقْفاً مَّحْفُوظاً وَهُمْ عَنْ آيَاتِهَا مُعْرِضُونَ,And We made the heaven a roof for the earth functioning like the roof of a house preserved from collapsing; and yet of the signs thereof namely the signs of this heaven such as the sun the moon and the stars they are disregardful failing to reflect on them and thus realise that the Creator of such things can have no partner.
وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِي خَلَقَ ٱلْلَّيْلَ وَٱلنَّهَارَ وَٱلشَّمْسَ وَٱلْقَمَرَ كُلٌّ فِي فَلَكٍ يَسْبَحُونَ,And He it is Who created the night and the day and the sun and the moon each kullun the nunation of this particle stands in place of the second noun of the genitive construction that would have been al-shams ‘the sun’ or al-qamar ‘the moon’ or their subsidiaries namely al-nujūm ‘the stars’ in an orbit a circular one like a mill in the sky swimming moving with speed like a swimmer in water. In order to effect the analogy with the latter the plural person of the verb employed for rational beings is used.
وَمَا جَعَلْنَا لِبَشَرٍ مِّن قَبْلِكَ ٱلْخُلْدَ أَفَإِنْ مِّتَّ فَهُمُ ٱلْخَالِدُونَ,When the disbelievers said that Muhammad (s) would die the following was revealed And We did not assign to any human being before you immortality permanence of life in this world. What if you are fated to die will they be immortal? in it? No! The last sentence constitutes the syntactical locus of the interrogative of denial.
كُلُّ نَفْسٍ ذَآئِقَةُ ٱلْمَوْتِ وَنَبْلُوكُم بِٱلشَّرِّ وَٱلْخَيْرِ فِتْنَةً وَإِلَيْنَا تُرْجَعُونَ,Every soul shall taste death in this world and We will try you We will test you with ill and good such as poverty and wealth sickness and health as an ordeal fitnatan an object denoting reason in other words for the purpose of seeing whether you will be patient and give thanks or not. And then unto Us you shall be brought back that We may requite you.
وَإِذَا رَآكَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوۤاْ إِن يَتَّخِذُونَكَ إِلاَّ هُزُواً أَهَـٰذَا ٱلَّذِي يَذْكُرُ آلِهَتَكُمْ وَهُمْ بِذِكْرِ ٱلرَّحْمَـٰنِ هُمْ كَافِرُونَ,And whenever the disbelievers see you they only take you in derision that is as one to be derided saying ‘Is this the one who mentions your gods?’ that is the one who derides them? And yet when it comes to the mention of the Compassionate One to them they hum repeated for emphasis are disbelieving of it saying ‘We do not know of any such individual’.
خُلِقَ ٱلإنْسَانُ مِنْ عَجَلٍ سَأُوْرِيكُمْ آيَاتِي فَلاَ تَسْتَعْجِلُونِ,The following was revealed regarding their demand that chastisement be hastened Man was created of haste that is to say because he is so hasty in his affairs it is as if he had been created out of it. Assuredly I shall show you My signs My promises of chastisement so do not demand that I hasten in sending it. And so He God made them suffer death at the battle of Badr.
وَيَقُولُونَ مَتَىٰ هَـٰذَا ٱلْوَعْدُ إِن كُنتُمْ صَادِقِينَ,And they say ‘When will this promise of resurrection be fulfilled if you are truthful?’ about it.
لَوْ يَعْلَمُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ حِينَ لاَ يَكُفُّونَ عَن وُجُوهِهِمُ ٱلنَّارَ وَلاَ عَن ظُهُورِهِمْ وَلاَ هُمْ يُنصَرُونَ,God exalted be He says If those who disbelieved only knew of the time when they shall not be able to ward off repel the Fire from their faces nor from their backs nor shall they be helped nor shall they be protected from it at the Resurrection the response to the conditional particle law ‘if only’ is something along the lines of ‘they would not have said that’.
بَلْ تَأْتِيهِم بَغْتَةً فَتَبْهَتُهُمْ فَلاَ يَسْتَطِيعُونَ رَدَّهَا وَلاَ هُمْ يُنظَرُونَ,Nay but it the Resurrection shall come upon them suddenly dumbfounding them confusing them and they shall not be able to ward it off nor shall they be granted any respite nor shall they be given any extra time to make a repentance or offer an excuse.
وَلَقَدِ ٱسْتُهْزِىءَ بِرُسُلٍ مِّن قَبْلِكَ فَحَاقَ بِٱلَّذِينَ سَخِرُواْ مِنْهُمْ مَّا كَانُواْ بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِئُونَ,And verily messengers before you were derided — herein is a statement to comfort the Prophet s — but those who mocked them were encircled by it was sent down against them that which they used to deride namely chastisement — likewise it shall befall those who have derided you.
قُلْ مَن يَكْلَؤُكُم بِٱلْلَّيْلِ وَٱلنَّهَارِ مِنَ ٱلرَّحْمَـٰنِ بَلْ هُمْ عَن ذِكْرِ رَبِّهِمْ مُّعْرِضُونَ,Say to them ‘Who can guard you preserve you by night and day from the Compassionate One?’ from His chastisement if it should befall you? In other words no one can do such a thing. Those being addressed here do not fear God’s chastisement because they deny the truth of it. Nay but of the Remembrance of their Lord that is the Qur’ān they are disregardful failing to reflect on it.
أَمْ لَهُمْ آلِهَةٌ تَمْنَعُهُمْ مِّن دُونِنَا لاَ يَسْتَطِيعُونَ نَصْرَ أَنْفُسِهِمْ وَلاَ هُمْ مِّنَّا يُصْحَبُونَ,Or is it that they have am ‘or’ functions with the sense of a hamza used to indicate denial that is read it as a-lahum ‘do they have’ gods to defend them against that which might cause them harm besides Us? In other words do they have anyone other than Us to defend them against such things? No! They namely the gods cannot help themselves and so they will not be able to help them; nor shall they the disbelievers be protected from Us from Our chastisement one may say sahibaka’Llāhu to mean ‘May God preserve and protect you’.
بَلْ مَتَّعْنَا هَـٰؤُلاۤءِ وَآبَآءَهُمْ حَتَّىٰ طَالَ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلْعُمُرُ أَفَلاَ يَرَوْنَ أَنَّا نَأْتِي ٱلأَرْضَ نَنقُصُهَا مِنْ أَطْرَافِهَآ أَفَهُمُ ٱلْغَالِبُونَ,Nay but We provided comforts for these and their fathers in the way of the graces which We bestowed on them until life lasted long for them so that they were deluded by such longevity. Do they not see how We visit the land how We target their land diminishing it at its edges? by granting the Prophet victory through conquest. Are they the ones who will prevail? No it is rather the Prophet and his Companions who will do so.
قُلْ إِنَّمَآ أُنذِرُكُم بِٱلْوَحْيِ وَلاَ يَسْمَعُ ٱلصُّمُّ ٱلدُّعَآءَ إِذَا مَا يُنذَرُونَ,Say to them ‘I warn you only by the Revelation’ that comes from God and not by my own prompting. But the deaf do not hear the call when idhā read pronouncing both hamzas fully or omitting the second hamza between it and the yā’ they are warned. They are like those who are deaf when they fail to act in accordance with the warnings they hear.
وَلَئِن مَّسَّتْهُمْ نَفْحَةٌ مِّنْ عَذَابِ رَبِّكَ لَيَقُولُنَّ يٰويْلَنَآ إِنَّا كُنَّا ظَالِمِينَ,And if a whiff a slight instance of your Lord’s chastisement were to touch them they would indeed say ‘O yā used for drawing attention to something woe for us! O this is our destruction! Truly we were doing evil’ in ascribing partners to God and denying the Mission of Muhammad (s).
وَنَضَعُ ٱلْمَوَازِينَ ٱلْقِسْطَ لِيَوْمِ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ فَلاَ تُظْلَمُ نَفْسٌ شَيْئاً وَإِن كَانَ مِثْقَالَ حَبَّةٍ مِّنْ خَرْدَلٍ أَتَيْنَا بِهَا وَكَفَىٰ بِنَا حَاسِبِينَ,And We shall set up the just balances the equitable ones for the Day of Resurrection that is on it and no soul shall be wronged in any way neither by deducting a good deed from its record nor by adding to it an evil one; and even if it the action be the weight of a single mustard seed We shall produce it with its full weight and We suffice as reckoners to count all things.
وَلَقَدْ آتَيْنَا مُوسَىٰ وَهَارُونَ ٱلْفُرْقَانَ وَضِيَآءً وَذِكْراً لَّلْمُتَّقِينَ,And verily We gave Moses and Aaron the Criterion the Torah that discriminates between truth and falsehood and between what is lawful and unlawful and an illumination by it and remembrance an admonition therein for those who are wary of God
ٱلَّذِينَ يَخْشَوْنَ رَبَّهُمْ بِٱلْغَيْبِ وَهُمْ مِّنَ ٱلسَّاعَةِ مُشْفِقُونَ,those who fear their Lord in concealment from people that is when they are in seclusion from them and who on account of the Hour that is on account of its terrors are apprehensive fearful.
وَهَـٰذَا ذِكْرٌ مُّبَارَكٌ أَنزَلْنَاهُ أَفَأَنْتُمْ لَهُ مُنكِرُونَ,And this namely the Qur’ān is a blessed Remembrance which We have revealed. Will you then deny it? the interrogative here is intended as a rebuke.
وَلَقَدْ آتَيْنَآ إِبْرَاهِيمَ رُشْدَهُ مِن قَبْلُ وَكُنَّا بِهِ عَالِمِينَ,And verily We had given Abraham his rectitude before that is his right guidance before he came of age — and We were Aware of him in that he was deserving of such guidance
إِذْ قَالَ لأَبِيهِ وَقَوْمِهِ مَا هَـٰذِهِ ٱلتَّمَاثِيلُ ٱلَّتِيۤ أَنتُمْ لَهَا عَاكِفُونَ,when he said to his father and his people ‘What are these images these idols to which you constantly cleave?’ that is which you are constantly worshipping.
قَالُواْ وَجَدْنَآ آبَآءَنَا لَهَا عَابِدِينَ,They said ‘We found our fathers worshipping them’ and so we followed their example.
قَالَ لَقَدْ كُنتُمْ أَنتُمْ وَآبَآؤُكُمْ فِي ضَلاَلٍ مُّبِينٍ,He said to them ‘Truly you and your fathers by worshipping them have been in manifest error’.
قَالُوۤاْ أَجِئْتَنَا بِٱلْحَقِّ أَمْ أَنتَ مِنَ ٱللاَّعِبِينَ,They said ‘Do you bring us the truth in that which you are saying or are you being frivolous?’ in this regard.
قَالَ بَل رَّبُّكُمْ رَبُّ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ ٱلَّذِي فطَرَهُنَّ وَأَنَاْ عَلَىٰ ذٰلِكُمْ مِّنَ ٱلشَّاهِدِينَ,He said ‘Nay but your Lord the only One worthy of being worshipped is the Lord the Owner of the heavens and the earth the One Who originated them Who created them without any precedent and to that which I have said I am a witness.
وَتَٱللَّهِ لأَكِيدَنَّ أَصْنَامَكُمْ بَعْدَ أَن تُوَلُّواْ مُدْبِرِينَ,And by God I shall devise a stratagem against your idols after you have gone away with your backs turned’.
فَجَعَلَهُمْ جُذَاذاً إِلاَّ كَبِيراً لَّهُمْ لَعَلَّهُمْ إِلَيْهِ يَرْجِعُونَ,And so after they had set off to a gathering of theirs on one of their festival days he reduced them to fragments read judhādhan or jidhādhan meaning ‘pieces’ smashing them with a hatchet all except the principal one among them around whose neck he hung the hatchet that they might return to it that is to the principal one and see what he had done to the others.
قَالُواْ مَن فَعَلَ هَـٰذَا بِآلِهَتِنَآ إِنَّهُ لَمِنَ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ,They said upon returning and seeing what had been done ‘Who has done this to our gods? Truly he is an evildoer’ in this regard.
قَالُواْ سَمِعْنَا فَتًى يَذْكُرُهُمْ يُقَالُ لَهُ إِبْرَاهِيمُ,They said one to the other ‘We heard a young man making ill mention of them deriding them — he is called Abraham’.
قَالُواْ فَأْتُواْ بِهِ عَلَىٰ أَعْيُنِ ٱلنَّاسِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَشْهَدُونَ,They said ‘Then bring him before the people’s eyes that is openly that they may testify’ against him as being the perpetrator.
قَالُوۤاْ أَأَنْتَ فَعَلْتَ هَـٰذَا بِآلِهَتِنَا يٰإِبْرَاهِيمُ,They said to him after he had been brought before them ‘So is it you read a-anta either pronouncing fully the two hamzas; or substituting an alif for the second one or not pronouncing it the second one and inserting an alif between the one not pronounced and the other one or without this insertion who has done this to our gods O Abraham?’
قَالَ بَلْ فَعَلَهُ كَبِيرُهُمْ هَـٰذَا فَاسْأَلُوهُمْ إِن كَانُواْ يِنْطِقُونَ,He said concealing his deed ‘Rather it was this principal one among them did it. So question them about the perpetrator of this if they can speak!’ here the response to the conditional statement precedes the conditional clause; in the preceding clause there is an intimation for them that an idol acknowledged as being incapable of action cannot be a god.
فَرَجَعُوۤاْ إِلَىٰ أَنفُسِهِمْ فَقَالُوۤاْ إِنَّكُمْ أَنتُمُ ٱلظَّالِمُونَ,So they turned thinking to themselves in reflection and they said to themselves ‘Truly it is you who are the evildoers’ for worshipping that which cannot speak.
ثُمَّ نُكِسُواْ عَلَىٰ رُءُوسِهِمْ لَقَدْ عَلِمْتَ مَا هَـٰؤُلاۤءِ يَنطِقُونَ,Then they were turned by God on their heads that is to say they were made to return to their disbelief and said ‘By God you are certainly aware that these idols cannot speak’ in other words how can you thus command us to question them?
قَالَ أَفَتَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ مَا لاَ يَنفَعُكُمْ شَيْئاً وَلاَ يَضُرُّكُمْ,He said ‘Do you then worship besides God that is in His place that which cannot benefit you in any way with regard to granting you provision and otherwise nor harm you? in any way if you were not to worship it?
أُفٍّ لَّكُمْ وَلِمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ أَفَلاَ تَعْقِلُونَ,Fie read uffin or uffan with the sense of a verbal noun meaning ‘a putrid thing or a vile thing be’ on you and what you worship besides God that is other than Him. Do you not comprehend?’ that these idols are not worthy of being worshipped and are not fit for such a purpose — only God exalted be He is worthy of it.
قَالُواْ حَرِّقُوهُ وَٱنصُرُوۤاْ آلِهَتَكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ فَاعِلِينَ,They said ‘Burn him that is burn Abraham and stand by your gods by having him burnt if you are to do anything’ in the way of standing by them. Thus they gathered lots of firewood and lit a fire throughout it. They then tied up Abraham placed him in a ballista and had him hurled into the fire. God exalted be He says
قُلْنَا يٰنَارُ كُونِي بَرْداً وَسَلَٰماً عَلَىٰ إِبْرَاهِيمَ,We said ‘O fire! Be coolness and safety for Abraham!’ and so it only consumed the bonds with which he had been tied. Its heat departed but its luminosity remained. And by His words wa-salāman ‘and safety’ Abraham was safe from salima death because of its coolness.
وَأَرَادُواْ بِهِ كَيْداً فَجَعَلْنَاهُمُ ٱلأَخْسَرِينَ,And they sought to outwit him namely by having him burnt but We made them the greater losers in what they sought.
وَنَجَّيْنَاهُ وَلُوطاً إِلَى ٱلأَرْضِ ٱلَّتِي بَارَكْنَا فِيهَا لِلْعَالَمِينَ,And We delivered him as well as Lot — son of his Abraham’s brother Hārān — from Iraq and brought them to the land which We have blessed for all peoples blessed it with an abundance of rivers and trees and this is Syria. Abraham settled in Palestine and Lot in the Sinful City al-mu’tafika cf. Q. 5353; and between the two is the distance of a day’s journey.
وَوَهَبْنَا لَهُ إِسْحَاقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ نَافِلَةً وَكُلاًّ جَعَلْنَا صَالِحِينَ,And We gave him namely Abraham — for he had asked for a child as mentioned in sūrat al-Sāffāt Q. 37100 — Isaac and Jacob as a gift that is as something in addition to what was requested; or it means ‘a grandson’; and each of them that is himself and the two born of him We made righteous We made them prophets.
وَجَعَلْنَاهُمْ أَئِمَّةً يَهْدُونَ بِأَمْرِنَا وَأَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَيْهِمْ فِعْلَ ٱلْخَيْرَاتِ وَإِقَامَ ٱلصَّلاَة وَإِيتَآءَ ٱلزَّكَـاةِ وَكَانُواْ لَنَا عَابِدِينَ,And We made them leaders read a-immatan pronouncing both hamzas or substituting the second one with a yā’ whose example of good conduct is followed guiding people by Our command to Our religion and We inspired in them the performance of good deeds and the maintenance of prayers and the payment of alms that is We inspired that these good deeds be performed prayers be maintained and alms be payed by them and by their followers the final hā’ of iqāma has been omitted to soften the reading and they used to worship Us.
وَلُوطاً آتَيْنَاهُ حُكْماً وَعِلْماً وَنَجَّيْنَاهُ مِنَ ٱلْقَرْيَةِ ٱلَّتِي كَانَت تَّعْمَلُ ٱلْخَبَائِثَ إِنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ قَوْمَ سَوْءٍ فَاسِقِينَ,And to Lot We gave judgement the ability to judge decisively between opposing parties and knowledge; and We delivered him from the town which had been committing that is whose inhabitants had been committing deeds of vileness by way of homosexual intercourse hazelnut-hurling and bird-games and other things. Truly they were a folk of evil people saw’ is the verbal noun of sā’ahu ‘he harmed him’ the opposite of sarrahu ‘he delighted him’ immoral.
وَأَدْخَلْنَاهُ فِي رَحْمَتِنَآ إِنَّهُ مِنَ ٱلصَّالِحِينَ,And We admitted him into Our mercy by Our saving him from his people. He was indeed one of the righteous.
وَنُوحاً إِذْ نَادَىٰ مِن قَبْلُ فَٱسْتَجَبْنَا لَهُ فَنَجَّيْنَاهُ وَأَهْلَهُ مِنَ ٱلْكَرْبِ ٱلْعَظِيمِ,And mention Noah what follows Nūhan substitutes for it when he called when he supplicated to God against his people — with the words My Lord do not leave upon the earth any inhabitant from among the disbelievers … to the end of the verse Q. 7126 before that is before the time of Abraham and Lot. And We responded to him and delivered him and his people who were in the Ark with him from the great agony namely from drowning and his people’s denial of him.
وَنَصَرْنَاهُ مِنَ ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلَّذِينَ كَذَّبُواْ بِآيَاتِنَا إِنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ قَوْمَ سَوْءٍ فَأَغْرَقْنَاهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ,And We helped him We defended him against the people who denied Our signs the ones indicating his Mission lest they cause him any harm. They were indeed an evil people so We drowned them all.
وَدَاوُودَ وَسُلَيْمَانَ إِذْ يَحْكُمَانِ فِي ٱلْحَرْثِ إِذْ نَفَشَتْ فِيهِ غَنَمُ ٱلْقَوْمِ وَكُنَّا لِحُكْمِهِمْ شَاهِدِينَ,And mention David and Solomon that is mention their story Dāwūda wa-Sulaymāna is substituted by the following idh yahkumāni … when they gave judgement concerning the tillage a field of crops or a vineyard when the sheep of a certain people strayed into it that is when these sheep grazed there at night but without a shepherd because they had escaped; and We were witnesses to their judgement li-hukmihim shāhidīna here the plural person is being used in the case of a dual. David decreed to the owner of the tillage belong the head of the sheep. Solomon decreed he shall benefit from the use of their milk offspring and wool until such time as the tillage is restored to its original state at the hands of the owner of the sheep after which he the owner of the tillage should return them the sheep to him their owner.
فَفَهَّمْنَاهَا سُلَيْمَانَ وَكُلاًّ آتَيْنَا حُكْماً وَعِلْماً وَسَخَّرْنَا مَعَ دَاوُودَ ٱلْجِبَالَ يُسَبِّحْنَ وَٱلطَّيْرَ وَكُنَّا فَاعِلِينَ,And We gave understanding of this that is the judgement to Solomon. It is said that both of their decisions were the result of independent judgement exercised by both and that David consulted Solomon; but it is also said that their decisions were by way of inspiration from God — the second decision abrogated the first. And to each of the twain We gave judgement prophethood and knowledge in matters of religion. And We disposed the mountains to glorify God with David and the birds also were disposed to glorify God with him for he David had commanded such glorification on their part so that whenever there was a lapse on his part he would be reminded to apply himself to the task of glorifying God promptly. And We were certainly doers of this disposing of them to glorify God along with him even if it should amaze you that they should be able to respond to the lord David.
وَعَلَّمْنَاهُ صَنْعَةَ لَبُوسٍ لَّكُمْ لِتُحْصِنَكُمْ مِّن بَأْسِكُمْ فَهَلْ أَنتُمْ شَاكِرُونَ,And We taught him the art of making garments namely coats of mail — which are called labūs because they are worn tulbas. He was the first human being to make them; hitherto there were only plates of armour — for you as well as all mankind to protect you read nuhsinakum the subject being ‘God’; or yuhsinakum the subject being ‘David’; or tuhsinakum the subject being ‘garments’ against your mutual violence your wars against your enemies. Will you then O people of Mecca be thankful? for My favours by believing in the Messenger — in other words be thankful to Me by doing this.
وَلِسُلَيْمَانَ ٱلرِّيحَ عَاصِفَةً تَجْرِي بِأَمْرِهِ إِلَى ٱلأَرْضِ ٱلَّتِي بَارَكْنَا فِيهَا وَكُنَّا بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عَالِمِينَ,And We disposed for Solomon the wind to blow strongly — in another verse it is described as being rukhā’an ‘to blow softly’ Q. 3836; in other words it is either blowing violently or gently respectively according to what he Solomon wanted — making its way at his command to the land which We have blessed namely Syria; and We have knowledge of all things among them the fact that God exalted be He knew that what He gave to Solomon would prompt him to be subservient to his Lord and so God did this in accordance with His knowledge.
وَمِنَ ٱلشَّيَاطِينِ مَن يَغُوصُونَ لَهُ وَيَعْمَلُونَ عَمَلاً دُونَ ذٰلِكَ وَكُنَّا لَهُمْ حَافِظِينَ,And We disposed of the devils some that dived for him plunging into the sea and bringing out of it jewels for Solomon and performed tasks other than that that is other than diving such as building and otherwise. And We were watchful over them lest they should spoil what they had made for whenever they completed a task before nightfall they would invariably spoil it unless they were occupied with some other task.
وَأَيُّوبَ إِذْ نَادَىٰ رَبَّهُ أَنِّي مَسَّنِيَ ٱلضُّرُّ وَأَنتَ أَرْحَمُ ٱلرَّاحِمِينَ,And mention Job Ayyūba is substituted by the following idh nādā rabbahu … when he called out to his Lord — after he had been afflicted with the loss of all of his possessions and children the laceration of his body his being shunned by all except his wife for a period of thirteen seventeen or eighteen years as well as the affliction of enduring a straitened means of livelihood — ‘Indeed read annī because of the implicit yā’ of the first person pronoun harm adversity has befallen me and You are the Most Merciful of the merciful’.
فَٱسْتَجَبْنَا لَهُ فَكَشَفْنَا مَا بِهِ مِن ضُرٍّ وَآتَيْنَاهُ أَهْلَهُ وَمِثْلَهُمْ مَّعَهُمْ رَحْمَةً مِّنْ عِندِنَا وَذِكْرَىٰ لِلْعَابِدِينَ,So We responded to him in his call and removed the harm that had befallen him and We gave him back his family his male and female children by bringing them back to life — of each sex there were three or seven along with them other children the like of them from his wife for she was made younger. He had also possessed a threshing floor for wheat and another for barley so God sent two clouds and one of them poured forth gold onto the wheat threshing floor and the other poured forth silver onto the barley threshing floor until they overflowed; as a mercy rahmatan a direct object denoting reason from Us min ‘indinā an adjectival phrase and a reminder to worshippers that they be patient and thus be rewarded by God.
وَإِسْمَاعِيلَ وَإِدْرِيسَ وَذَا ٱلْكِفْلِ كُلٌّ مِّنَ ٱلصَّابِرِينَ,And mention Ishmael and Idrīs and Dhū’l-Kifl — all were of the patient in maintaining obedience to God and staying away from acts of disobedience to Him.
وَأَدْخَلْنَاهُمْ فِي رَحْمَتِنَا إِنَّهُمْ مِّنَ ٱلصَّالِحِينَ,And We admitted them into Our mercy through granting them prophethood. Indeed they were among the worthy of it. Dhū’l-Kifl was so called because he undertook takaffala to fast every day and stay up every night in prayer and to pass judgement between people without succumbing to anger and fulfilled this undertaking. It is also said however that he was not a prophet.
وَذَا ٱلنُّونِ إِذ ذَّهَبَ مُغَاضِباً فَظَنَّ أَن لَّن نَّقْدِرَ عَلَيْهِ فَنَادَىٰ فِي ٱلظُّلُمَاتِ أَن لاَّ إِلَـٰهَ إِلاَّ أَنتَ سُبْحَانَكَ إِنِّي كُنتُ مِنَ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ,And mention Dhū’l-Nūn the one of the whale namely Jonah son of Amittai Yūnus bin Mattā when he went off enraged Dhā’l-Nūn is substituted by the clause idh dhahaba mughādiban by his people that is furious with them because of what he had suffered at their hands — even though he had not been granted permission by God to go off as he did — thinking that We had no power over him that is that We could not compel him to submit to Our decree in the way that We did by imprisoning him inside the stomach of the whale; or that We could not make circumstances difficult for him. Then he cried out in the darknesses through the darkness of the night the darkness of the sea and the darkness of the whale’s stomach that ‘There is no god except You! Glory be to You! I have indeed been one of the wrongdoers’ for leaving my people without Your permission.
فَٱسْتَجَبْنَا لَهُ وَنَجَّيْنَاهُ مِنَ ٱلْغَمِّ وَكَذٰلِكَ نُنجِـي ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,So We responded to him and delivered him from the distress by means of those words and thus in the same way that We delivered him We deliver the believers from their anguish when they call out to Us seeking succour.
وَزَكَرِيَّآ إِذْ نَادَىٰ رَبَّهُ رَبِّ لاَ تَذَرْنِي فَرْداً وَأَنتَ خَيْرُ ٱلْوَارِثِينَ,And mention Zachariah Zakariyyā is substituted by the following idh nādā rabbahu … when he cried out to his Lord saying ‘My Lord do not leave me without an heir without a son to inherit from me and You are the best of inheritors’ the One that endures after all of your creation has perished.
فَٱسْتَجَبْنَا لَهُ وَوَهَبْنَا لَهُ يَحْيَىٰ وَأَصْلَحْنَا لَهُ زَوْجَهُ إِنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ يُسَارِعُونَ فِي ٱلْخَيْرَاتِ وَيَدْعُونَنَا رَغَباً وَرَهَباً وَكَانُواْ لَنَا خاشِعِينَ,So We responded to him in his call and gave him John as a son and We restored fertility to his wife for him and so she bore a child having been barren. Truly they those prophets that have been mentioned would hasten to they would hurry to perform good works namely acts of obedience and supplicate Us out of desire for Our mercy and in awe of Our chastisement and they were submissive before Us humble in their worship.
وَٱلَّتِيۤ أَحْصَنَتْ فَرْجَهَا فَنَفَخْنَا فِيهَا مِن رُّوحِنَا وَجَعَلْنَاهَا وَٱبْنَهَآ آيَةً لِّلْعَالَمِينَ,And mention Mary the one who guarded her virginity the one who preserved it from being taken so We breathed into her of Our spirit namely Gabriel when he breathed into the opening of her garment and she conceived Jesus. And We made her and her son a sign for all the worlds that is for mankind jinn and angels because she bore him without having a male partner.
إِنَّ هَـٰذِهِ أُمَّتُكُمْ أُمَّةً وَاحِدَةً وَأَنَاْ رَبُّكُمْ فَٱعْبُدُونِ,‘Truly this creed of Islam is your community your religion O you who are being addressed — in other words you must adhere to it as one community this being a necessary state of affairs and I am your Lord so worship Me’ affirm My Oneness.
وَتَقَطَّعُوۤاْ أَمْرَهُمْ بَيْنَهُمْ كُلٌّ إِلَيْنَا رَاجِعُونَ,But they that is to say some of those being addressed fragmented their affair among themselves that is they became divided in the matter of their religion and at variance over it — these are the different sects of the Jews and the Christians. God exalted be He says All shall return to Us and We will requite each according to his deeds.
فَمَن يَعْمَلْ مِنَ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ وَهُوَ مُؤْمِنٌ فَلاَ كُفْرَانَ لِسَعْيِهِ وَإِنَّا لَهُ كَاتِبُونَ,And whoever performs righteous deeds being a believer — no rejection that is no denial will there be of his endeavour and We will indeed write it down for him by commanding the guardian angels to record it and then We requite him for it.
وَحَرَامٌ عَلَىٰ قَرْيَةٍ أَهْلَكْنَاهَآ أَنَّهُمْ لاَ يَرْجِعُونَ,It is forbidden for any town meaning it is forbidden for its people which We have destroyed that they should lā yarji‘ūna the lā is extra return that is their return to this world is prohibited.
حَتَّىٰ إِذَا فُتِحَتْ يَأْجُوجُ وَمَأْجُوجُ وَهُمْ مِّن كُلِّ حَدَبٍ يَنسِلُونَ,Until hattā a particle expressing the end of the prohibition of their return when Gog and Magog read Ya’jūju wa-Ma’jūju or Yājūju wa-Mājūju these are non-Arabic names of two tribes; there is an implicit genitive annexation before this clause namely the gates of the sadd ‘the barrier’ built against them are let loose read futihat or futtihat — and this will happen near the time of the Resurrection — and they slide down they hasten from every slope every highland.
وَٱقْتَرَبَ ٱلْوَعْدُ ٱلْحَقُّ فَإِذَا هِيَ شَاخِصَةٌ أَبْصَارُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ يٰوَيْلَنَا قَدْ كُنَّا فِي غَفْلَةٍ مِّنْ هَـٰذَا بَلْ كُنَّا ظَالِمِينَ,And the true promise that is the Day of Resurrection draws near and behold when the gaze of the disbelievers will be fixed on that Day because of its severity saying ‘O yā is for exclamation woe to us! this is our destruction! Verily in the life of the world we were oblivious to this Day. Nay but we were doing wrong’ to our souls by our denial of the messengers.
إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ,‘Truly you O people of Mecca and what you worship besides God that is other than Him in the way of graven images shall be fuel for Hell you shall be its fodder; and you shall come to it’ you shall enter it.
لَوْ كَانَ هَـٰؤُلاۤءِ آلِهَةً مَّا وَرَدُوهَا وَكُلٌّ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ,Had these graven images been gods as you claim they would never have come to it they would never have entered it and they will all both the worshippers and the worshipped abide therein.
لَهُمْ فِيهَا زَفِيرٌ وَهُمْ فِيهَا لاَ يَسْمَعُونَ,For them for the worshippers there will be groaning therein and they will not hear in it anything because of the ferocity with which it boils. When ‘Abd Allāh Ibn al-Ziba‘rī said ‘Ezra Jesus and the angels were worshipped they must also be in the Fire then according to what has just been stated’ the following was revealed
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ سَبَقَتْ لَهُمْ مِّنَّا ٱلْحُسْنَىٰ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ عَنْهَا مُبْعَدُونَ,Indeed those to whom the promise of the best reward the best status went beforehand from Us and among such are those who have just been mentioned they will be kept away from it.
لاَ يَسْمَعُونَ حَسِيسَهَا وَهُمْ فِي مَا ٱشْتَهَتْ أَنفُسُهُمْ خَالِدُونَ,They will not hear the faintest sound from it and they will abide in what their souls desired of bliss.
لاَ يَحْزُنُهُمُ ٱلْفَزَعُ ٱلأَكْبَرُ وَتَتَلَقَّاهُمُ ٱلْمَلاَئِكَةُ هَـٰذَا يَوْمُكُمُ ٱلَّذِي كُنتُمْ تُوعَدُونَ,The Supreme Terror — which is that a servant be ordered off to the Fire shall not grieve them and the angels shall receive them upon their exiting from their graves saying to them ‘This is your day the one which you were promised’ during the life of the world.
يَوْمَ نَطْوِي ٱلسَّمَآءَ كَطَيِّ ٱلسِّجِلِّ لِلْكُتُبِ كَمَا بَدَأْنَآ أَوَّلَ خَلْقٍ نُّعِيدُهُ وَعْداً عَلَيْنَآ إِنَّا كُنَّا فَاعِلِينَ,The day yawma is in the accusative because of an implied preceding udhkur ‘mention’ when We shall roll up the heaven as the Scribe al-sijill being the name of an angel rolls up the written scroll that is the scroll of the son of Adam when he dies the lām of li’l-kitāb is extra; alternatively one may read the verse so that al-sijill is ‘the scroll’ and al-kitāb means al-maktūb ‘what is written’ in which case the lām of li’l-kitāb has the sense of the particle ‘alā ‘over’; a variant reading for li’l-kitāb has the plural li’l-kutub ‘the books’. As We began the first creation from non-existence We shall repeat it after making it non-existent the kāf of ka-mā ‘as’ is semantically connected to nu‘īdu ‘We shall repeat it’ and its suffixed pronoun -hu ‘it’ refers back to awwala ‘the first’; the mā relates to the verbal noun — a promise binding on Us wa‘dan is in the accusative because it is the direct object of an implied preceding wa‘adnā ‘We promised’ and the clause constitutes a confirmation of the import of the preceding verse 103. Truly We shall do that which We have promised.
وَلَقَدْ كَتَبْنَا فِي ٱلزَّبُورِ مِن بَعْدِ ٱلذِّكْرِ أَنَّ ٱلأَرْضَ يَرِثُهَا عِبَادِيَ ٱلصَّالِحُونَ,Certainly We wrote in the Scripture al-zabūr means ‘the Book’ that is the revealed Books of God after the Remembrance meaning the Mother of the Book umm al-kitāb which is kept with God ‘Indeed the land the land of Paradise shall be inherited by My righteous servants’ — this promise applies to all righteous ones.
إِنَّ فِي هَـٰذَا لَبَلاَغاً لِّقَوْمٍ عَابِدِينَ,Indeed there is in this Qur’ān a proclamation sufficient means for securing entry into Paradise for a people who are devout acting in accordance with what is stipulated in it.
وَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَاكَ إِلاَّ رَحْمَةً لِّلْعَالَمِينَ,We did not send you O Muhammad (s) except as a mercy that is to give mercy to all the worlds the worlds of mankind and jinn through you.
قُلْ إِنَّمَآ يُوحَىٰ إِلَيَّ أَنَّمَآ إِلَـٰهُكُمْ إِلَـٰهٌ وَاحِدٌ فَهَلْ أَنتُمْ مُّسْلِمُونَ,Say ‘All that is being revealed to me is that your God is One God that is the only thing that is being revealed to me with respect to the Divine is His Oneness. So will you submit?’ will you accede to affirming the Oneness of the Divine that is being revealed to me? the interrogative is meant as an imperative.
فَإِن تَوَلَّوْاْ فَقُلْ ءَاذَنتُكُمْ عَلَىٰ سَوَآءٍ وَإِنْ أَدْرِيۤ أَقَرِيبٌ أَم بَعِيدٌ مَّا تُوعَدُونَ,But if they turn away from this say ‘I have proclaimed to you I have notified you of my declaration of war on you all alike ‘alā sawā’ is a circumstantial qualifier referring to both the subject of the verb and the object that is to say you are all equal in having knowledge of this I shall not proceed independently without having first informed you in order for you to make preparations although I do not know whether near or far is that which you have been promised’ with respect to chastisement or to the Day of Resurrection that comprises this chastisement; only God knows it.
إِنَّهُ يَعْلَمُ ٱلْجَهْرَ مِنَ ٱلْقَوْلِ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا تَكْتُمُونَ,Indeed He exalted be He knows whatever is spoken aloud and what you and others do and He knows what you conceal both you and others of secrets.
وَإِنْ أَدْرِي لَعَلَّهُ فِتْنَةٌ لَّكُمْ وَمَتَاعٌ إِلَىٰ حِينٍ,I do not know; perhaps that which I have notified you of but whose time is not known may be a trial a test for you to see how you will act and an enjoyment for a while that is until your terms of life are concluded this second clause wa-matā‘un ‘and an enjoyment’ counters the former which is the object of the optative expressed by the particle la‘alla ‘perhaps’; the second clause cannot be an optative.
قَالَ رَبِّ ٱحْكُم بِٱلْحَقِّ وَرَبُّنَا ٱلرَّحْمَـٰنُ ٱلْمُسْتَعَانُ عَلَىٰ مَا تَصِفُونَ,Say qul a variant reading has qāla ‘He said’ ‘My Lord! Judge between me and my deniers with truth by assigning chastisement for them or victory for me over them. And so they were chastised at the battles of Badr Uhud Hunayn al-Ahzāb and al-Khandaq and he the Prophet was given victory over them. And our Lord is the Compassionate One Whose help is to be sought against what you allege’ when you invent lies against God saying that ‘God has taken a son’ cf. Q. 2116; and against me when you say ‘he is a sorcerer’ cf. Q. 384 or against the Qur’ān when you say ‘it is poetry’ cf. Q. 5230.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّاسُ ٱتَّقُواْ رَبَّكُمْ إِنَّ زَلْزَلَةَ ٱلسَّاعَةِ شَيْءٌ عَظِيمٌ,O mankind that is the inhabitants of Mecca and others fear your Lord that is of His punishment by being obedient to Him. Surely the earthquake of the Hour of Doom that is the violent quaking of the earth after which the sun will rise from the west something which will be near the time of the Hour is a tremendous thing in the way it will distress people — this itself being a sort of punishment.
يَوْمَ تَرَوْنَهَا تَذْهَلُ كُلُّ مُرْضِعَةٍ عَمَّآ أَرْضَعَتْ وَتَضَعُ كُلُّ ذَاتِ حَمْلٍ حَمْلَهَا وَتَرَى ٱلنَّاسَ سُكَارَىٰ وَمَا هُم بِسُكَارَىٰ وَلَـٰكِنَّ عَذَابَ ٱللَّهِ شَدِيدٌ,On the day when you behold it every actually nursing female on account of this tremendous day will neglect her suckling that is she will forget it; and every pregnant female will deliver her burden and you will see mankind as though drunk because of the severity of their fear yet they will not be drunk because of any drink; but God’s chastisement is severe and so they will be terrified of it.
وَمِنَ ٱلنَّاسِ مَن يُجَادِلُ فِي ٱللَّهِ بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ وَيَتَّبِعُ كُلَّ شَيْطَانٍ مَّرِيدٍ,The following was revealed regarding al-Nadr b. al-Hārith and his companions And among mankind are those who dispute about God without any knowledge — they would say ‘The angels are God’s daughters and the Qur’ān a collection of the fables of the ancients’. In addition they would deny resurrection and the bringing back to life of those who had become dust — and those who follow in their manner of disputing every rebellious devil
كُتِبَ عَلَيْهِ أَنَّهُ مَن تَوَلاَّهُ فَأَنَّهُ يُضِلُّهُ وَيَهْدِيهِ إِلَىٰ عَذَابِ ٱلسَّعِيرِ,about whom it has been decreed in other words it has been decreed with regards to a devil that whoever takes him for a friend that is whoever follows him he will make him go astray and will lead him summon him to the chastisement of the Blaze namely to the Fire.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّاسُ إِن كُنتُمْ فِي رَيْبٍ مِّنَ ٱلْبَعْثِ فَإِنَّا خَلَقْنَاكُمْ مِّن تُرَابٍ ثُمَّ مِن نُّطْفَةٍ ثُمَّ مِنْ عَلَقَةٍ ثُمَّ مِن مُّضْغَةٍ مُّخَلَّقَةٍ وَغَيْرِ مُخَلَّقَةٍ لِّنُبَيِّنَ لَكُمْ وَنُقِرُّ فِي ٱلأَرْحَامِ مَا نَشَآءُ إِلَىٰ أَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّى ثُمَّ نُخْرِجُكُمْ طِفْلاً ثُمَّ لِتَبْلُغُوۤاْ أَشُدَّكُمْ وَمِنكُمْ مَّن يُتَوَفَّىٰ وَمِنكُمْ مَّن يُرَدُّ إِلَىٰ أَرْذَلِ ٱلْعُمُرِ لِكَيْلاَ يَعْلَمَ مِن بَعْدِ عِلْمٍ شَيْئاً وَتَرَى ٱلأَرْضَ هَامِدَةً فَإِذَآ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْهَا ٱلْمَآءَ ٱهْتَزَّتْ وَرَبَتْ وَأَنبَتَتْ مِن كُلِّ زَوْجٍ بَهِيجٍ,O mankind in other words O people of Mecca if you are in doubt about the Resurrection then lo! consider that We have created you that is We have created your origin — Adam — from dust then We created his progeny from a drop a sperm-drop then from a clot congealed blood then from a little lump of flesh mudgha a piece of flesh the size of what one would be able to chew mā yumdagh partly formed shaped complete in form and partly unformed that is uncomplete in form that We may make clear to you the perfect nature of Our power that you might then infer from this initial act of creation the reality of its future restoration. And We establish nuqirru marks a new grammatically independent sentence in the wombs whatever We will for a specified time that is until the time for it to come out then We bring you forth from the bellies of your mothers as infants and then We extend your life that you may come of age ashuddakum that is to say your prime and strength which is that age between thirty and forty years. And there are some of you who are taken away by death before coming of age and there are some of you who are relegated to the most abject time of life its most despicable state of decrepitude and senility so that after having had some knowledge he no longer knows anything — ‘Ikrima said ‘Whoever recites the Qur’ān such a state will not befall him’. And you see the earth torpid barren yet when We send down water upon it it stirs it moves and swells it rises and grows and grows plants of anbatat min min is extra every delightful fair kind species.
ذٰلِكَ بِأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ هُوَ ٱلْحَقُّ وَأَنَّهُ يُحْيِـي ٱلْمَوْتَىٰ وَأَنَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,That which is mentioned from the commencement of man’s creation to the end of the description of the earth being revived is because God He is the Truth the Constant the Permanent and because He revives the dead and has power over all things;
وَأَنَّ ٱلسَّاعَةَ آتِيَةٌ لاَّ رَيْبَ فِيهَا وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَبْعَثُ مَن فِي ٱلْقُبُورِ,and because the Hour will come whereof there is no doubt uncertainty; and because God will resurrect those who are in the graves.
ومِنَ ٱلنَّاسِ مَن يُجَادِلُ فِي ٱللَّهِ بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ وَلاَ هُدًى وَلاَ كِتَابٍ مُّنِيرٍ,The following was revealed regarding Abū Jahl And among mankind there are some who dispute about God without any knowledge or guidance being with him or an enlightening Scripture one containing light being with him
ثَانِيَ عِطْفِهِ لِيُضِلَّ عَن سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ لَهُ فِي ٱلدُّنْيَا خِزْيٌ وَنُذِيقُهُ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ عَذَابَ ٱلْحَرِيقِ,turning aside thāniya ‘itfihi a circumstantial qualifier meaning ‘turning his neck aside in disdain of belief; al-ītf means ‘a side’ and can be either the left or the right to go astray read li-yadilla; or li-yudilla ‘to lead others astray’ from the way of God that is from His religion. For him there will be ignominy chastisement in this world — thus he Abū Jahl was slain on the day of Badr — and on the Day of Resurrection We shall make him taste the chastisement of the burning that is the chastisement of being burnt in the Fire and it shall be said to him
ذٰلِكَ بِمَا قَدَّمَتْ يَدَاكَ وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَيْسَ بِظَلَّٰمٍ لِّلعَبِيدِ,‘That is the chastisement for what your hands have sent ahead in other words what you have offered in the way of deeds — He refers to him with reference to the two hands as opposed to other parts because most actions are effected through them — and because God is not unjust to His servants’ chastising them without their having committed any sin.
وَمِنَ ٱلنَّاسِ مَن يَعْبُدُ ٱللَّهَ عَلَىٰ حَرْفٍ فَإِنْ أَصَابَهُ خَيْرٌ ٱطْمَأَنَّ بِهِ وَإِنْ أَصَابَتْهُ فِتْنَةٌ ٱنْقَلَبَ عَلَىٰ وَجْهِهِ خَسِرَ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَٱلأَخِرَةَ ذٰلِكَ هُوَ ٱلْخُسْرَانُ ٱلْمُبِينُ,And among mankind there are those who worship God on a knife-edge that is with uncertainty in his worship — such a person has been likened the knife- edge of a mountain in his precariousness — if good fortune befalls him so that he enjoys health and security with respect to his own self and his property he is reassured by it; but if an ordeal befalls him a trial or ill-health with regard to himself or his property he makes a turnabout that is he reverts to disbelief losing both this world when what he had hoped for in it has eluded him and the Hereafter by his disbelief. That is the manifest loss.
يَدْعُواْ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ مَا لاَ يَضُرُّهُ وَمَا لاَ يَنفَعُهُ ذٰلِكَ هُوَ ٱلضَّلاَلُ ٱلْبَعِيدُ,He calls on he worships besides God in the way of idols that which could not hurt him should he refrain from worshipping it and that which could not profit him if were to worship it. Such a call is extreme error from the truth.
يَدْعُو لَمَنْ ضَرُّهُ أَقْرَبُ مِن نَّفْعِهِ لَبِئْسَ ٱلْمَوْلَىٰ وَلَبِئْسَ ٱلْعَشِيرُ,He calls on him the lām of la-man is extra whose harm when worshipped is likelier than his benefit even if he were to have any benefit as he imagines him to have. Truly an evil patron is he that is an evil helper and an evil friend an evil companion is he. After the mention of ‘the doubter’ and his being in manifest ‘loss’ above verse 11 there follows the mention of the believers and their reward as follows
إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُدْخِلُ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ جَنَاتٍ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلأَنْهَارُ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَفْعَلُ مَا يُرِيدُ,Truly God shall admit those who believe and perform righteous deeds in the way of obligatory and supererogatory acts of worship into gardens underneath which rivers flow. Indeed God does whatever He desires in the way of showing beneficence to those who obey Him and degrading those who disobey Him.
مَن كَانَ يَظُنُّ أَن لَّن يَنصُرَهُ ٱللَّهُ فِي ٱلدُّنْيَا وَٱلآخِرَةِ فَلْيَمْدُدْ بِسَبَبٍ إِلَى ٱلسَّمَآءِ ثُمَّ لْيَقْطَعْ فَلْيَنْظُرْ هَلْ يُذْهِبَنَّ كَيْدُهُ مَا يَغِيظُ,Whoever supposes that God will not help him namely Muhammad (s) His Prophet in this world and the Hereafter let him extend a rope to the ceiling to the roof of his house fixing it there and tying it to his neck and let him hang himself that is let him choke to death because of it by severing his soul from any existence on the earth as reported in the various Sahīh compilations. Then let him see whether his strategy against the Prophet being helped dispels that which enrages him about it. In other words let him choke to death with rage because of it for it is inevitable.
وَكَذٰلِكَ أَنزَلْنَاهُ آيَاتٍ بَيِّنَاتٍ وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَهْدِي مَن يُرِيدُ,So just as We revealed the previous verse We revealed it that is the remainder of the Qur’ān as clear signs manifest signs bayyināt ‘clear signs’ is a circumstantial qualifier and indeed God guides whomever He desires that he be guided wa-anna’Llāha yahdī man yurīdu a supplement to the suffixed pronoun hā’ ‘it’ of anzalnāhu ‘We revealed it’.
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَٱلَّذِينَ هَادُواْ وَٱلصَّابِئِينَ وَٱلنَّصَارَىٰ وَٱلْمَجُوسَ وَٱلَّذِينَ أَشْرَكُوۤاْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَفْصِلُ بَيْنَهُمْ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيامَةِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ شَهِيدٌ,Truly those who believe and those of Jewry namely the Jews and the Sabaeans a sect from among them and the Christians and the Magians and the polytheists — God will indeed judge between them on the Day of Resurrection by admitting the believers into Paradise and all others into the Fire. Assuredly God over all things the things which they do is Witness Knowing them a knowledge of direct vision ‘ilm mushāhada.
أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَسْجُدُ لَهُ مَن فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَن فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَٱلشَّمْسُ وَٱلْقَمَرُ وَٱلنُّجُومُ وَٱلْجِبَالُ وَٱلشَّجَرُ وَٱلدَّوَآبُّ وَكَثِيرٌ مِّنَ ٱلنَّاسِ وَكَثِيرٌ حَقَّ عَلَيْهِ ٱلْعَذَابُ وَمَن يُهِنِ ٱللَّهُ فَمَا لَهُ مِن مُّكْرِمٍ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَفْعَلُ مَا يَشَآءُ,Have you not seen have you not realised that to God prostrate whoever is in the heavens and whoever is in the earth together with the sun and the moon and the stars and the mountains and the trees and the animals that is how they are submissive to Him in what He wills of them as well as many of mankind? namely the believers who prostrate to Him in addition to their submissiveness to Him when prostrating in prayer. And for many the chastisement has become due and these are the disbelievers for they refuse to prostrate an action which is contingent on belief. And he whom God abases he whom He makes unprosperous there is none to give him honour none to make him fortunate. Indeed God does whatever He will in the way of abasing or giving honour.
هَـٰذَانِ خَصْمَانِ ٱخْتَصَمُواْ فِي رَبِّهِمْ فَٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ قُطِّعَتْ لَهُمْ ثِيَابٌ مِّن نَّارٍ يُصَبُّ مِن فَوْقِ رُءُوسِهِمُ ٱلْحَمِيمُ,These twain are two contenders that is the believers constitute one contending party and the five categories of disbelievers constitute the other contending party the term khasm ‘contender’ may be used to refer to one or many who contend concerning their Lord that is to say concerning His religion. As for those who disbelieve garments of fire will be cut out for them garments which they will wear — meaning that the Fire will encompass them — and boiling water will be poured over their heads hamīm is water that has reached an extreme temperature
يُصْهَرُ بِهِ مَا فِي بُطُونِهِمْ وَٱلْجُلُودُ,whereby will be melted that which is in their bellies of fats and otherwise and whereby will be grilled their skins.
وَلَهُمْ مَّقَامِعُ مِنْ حَدِيدٍ,And there will be hooked rods of iron for them for their heads to be beaten with.
كُلَّمَآ أَرَادُوۤاْ أَن يَخْرُجُواْ مِنْهَا مِنْ غَمٍّ أُعِيدُواْ فِيهَا وَذُوقُواْ عَذَابَ ٱلْحَرِيقِ,Whenever they desire to exit from it that is from the Fire on account of their anguish they are made to return into it they are driven back into it with the hooked rods and it shall be said to them ‘Taste the chastisement of the burning!’ namely the one that has reached ultimate degree of combustion.
إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُدْخِلُ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلأَنْهَارُ يُحَلَّوْنَ فِيهَا مِنْ أَسَاوِرَ مِن ذَهَبٍ وَلُؤْلُؤاً وَلِبَاسُهُمْ فِيهَا حَرِيرٌ,And He God says of the believers Indeed God shall admit those who believe and perform righteous deeds into gardens underneath which rivers flow; adorned therein with bracelets of gold and pearl read wa-lu’lu’in genitive to mean bracelets made of both elements so that the pearls are set in gold; or read wa-lu’lu’an accusative as a supplement to the syntactical locus of min asāwira ‘bracelets’; and their raiment therein will be silk namely the one forbidden for men to wear in this world.
وَهُدُوۤاْ إِلَى ٱلطَّيِّبِ مِنَ ٱلْقَوْلِ وَهُدُوۤاْ إِلَىٰ صِرَاطِ ٱلْحَمِيدِ,And they shall be guided in this world to wholesome words namely ‘There is no god except God’ and they shall be guided to the path of the Praised that is to the praiseworthy way of God and His religion.
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَيَصُدُّونَ عَن سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ وَٱلْمَسْجِدِ ٱلْحَرَامِ ٱلَّذِي جَعَلْنَاهُ لِلنَّاسِ سَوَآءً ٱلْعَاكِفُ فِيهِ وَٱلْبَادِ وَمَن يُرِدْ فِيهِ بِإِلْحَادٍ بِظُلْمٍ نُّذِقْهُ مِنْ عَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ,Truly those who disbelieve and who bar from the way of God from obedience to Him and from the Sacred Mosque which We have assigned as a holy rite and a place of devotion for mankind equally for the dweller the one who resides therein and the visitor the passer-by; and whoever seeks to commit sacrilege therein the bā’ of bi-ilhādin ‘sacrilege’ is extra by doing wrong in other words for such a reason committing what is forbidden even if he should curse the Mosque’s attendant We shall make him taste a painful chastisement that is some such chastisement from this last clause one may derive the predicate of the introductory particle inna ‘truly’ and it is this ‘We shall make them taste a painful chastisement’.
وَإِذْ بَوَّأْنَا لإِبْرَاهِيمَ مَكَانَ ٱلْبَيْتِ أَن لاَّ تُشْرِكْ بِي شَيْئاً وَطَهِّرْ بَيْتِيَ لِلطَّآئِفِينَ وَٱلْقَآئِمِينَ وَٱلرُّكَّعِ ٱلسُّجُودِ,And mention when We settled when We pointed out for Abraham the site of the House that he may build it — for it the House had been raised to heaven at the time of the Flood — and We commanded him saying ‘Do not ascribe any partner to Me and purify My House of graven images for those who circumambulate it and those who are resident staying therein and those who bow and prostrate al-rukka‘ and al-sujūd are the plural forms of rāki‘ and sājid respectively those praying.
وَأَذِّن فِي ٱلنَّاسِ بِٱلْحَجِّ يَأْتُوكَ رِجَالاً وَعَلَىٰ كُلِّ ضَامِرٍ يَأْتِينَ مِن كُلِّ فَجٍّ عَميِقٍ,And announce call out among the people the season for Pilgrimage. Thus he cried out from the top of the mountain of Abū Qubays ‘O people your Lord has built a House and has made pilgrimage to it an obligation upon you so respond to the call of your Lord’ turning his face to the right and to the left to the east and to the west; and every one of those for whom the performance of the pilgrimage had been preordained by God from among the loins of men and the wombs of women responded to him thus ‘At Your service our Lord we are at Your service’ labbayka’Llāhumma labbayk. The response to the command clause is the following and they shall come to you on foot walking rijāl plural of rājil similar in pattern to qā’im ‘standing’ and its plural qiyām and riding on every lean camel that is on every emaciated camel dāmir this term may be used to refer to both male and female camels. They shall come that is the lean camels by grammatical agreement with the feminine verb form from every deep ravine from every distant route
لِّيَشْهَدُواْ مَنَافِعَ لَهُمْ وَيَذْكُرُواْ ٱسْمَ ٱللَّهِ فِيۤ أَيَّامٍ مَّعْلُومَاتٍ عَلَىٰ مَا رَزَقَهُمْ مِّن بَهِيمَةِ ٱلأَنْعَامِ فَكُلُواْ مِنْهَا وَأَطْعِمُواْ ٱلْبَآئِسَ ٱلْفَقِيرَ,that they may witness that they may be present before things that are of benefit to them in this world such as commerce or of benefit in the Hereafter or in both — all of which are valid alternative opinions — and mention God’s Name on appointed days namely the ten days of Dhū’l-Hijja or the Day of ‘Arafa or from the Day of Immolation up to the last days of tashrīq — all of which are valid alternative opinions — over the livestock which He has provided them such as the camels cows and sheep immolated on the Day of the ‘Īd and any subsequent offerings or sacrifices. “So eat thereof if it be recommended and feed the wretched poor” that is the one in dire poverty.
ثُمَّ لْيَقْضُواْ تَفَثَهُمْ وَلْيُوفُواْ نُذُورَهُمْ وَلْيَطَّوَّفُواْ بِٱلْبَيْتِ ٱلْعَتِيقِ,Then let them do away with their self-neglect that is to say let them remove any dirt or unkemptness such as any long fingernails and let them fulfil read wa’l-yūfū or wa’l-yuwaffū their vows in the way of offerings and sacrifices and perform the circumambulation the circumambulation following the egress from ‘Arafa of the Ancient House’ that is the Old one because it was the first House founded for mankind.
ذٰلِكَ وَمَن يُعَظِّمْ حُرُمَاتِ ٱللَّهِ فَهُوَ خَيْرٌ لَّهُ عِندَ رَبِّهِ وَأُحِلَّتْ لَكُمُ ٱلأَنْعَامُ إِلاَّ مَا يُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْكُمْ فَٱجْتَنِبُواْ ٱلرِّجْسَ مِنَ ٱلأَوْثَانِ وَٱجْتَنِبُواْ قَوْلَ ٱلزُّورِ,That is that dhālika the predicate of an implied subject in other words ‘the matter’ or ‘the affair’ is ‘that which has been mentioned’. And whoever venerates the sacraments of God namely those things whose violation is forbidden that veneration of them shall be better for him with his Lord in the Hereafter. And cattle are lawful for you to consume after their slaughter except for that which has been recited to you as being unlawful in the verse Forbidden to you is carrion … Q. 53. The exceptive clause above is a discontinuous one; but it could also be taken as continuous so that the prohibition is of that which has died and so on. So avoid the abomination of idols mina’l-awthān min here is explicative as opposed to partitive in other words ‘avoid abomination namely idols’ and avoid false speech that is to say ascribing partners to God in your uttering of the talbiya or avoid bearing false witness;
حُنَفَآءَ للَّهِ غَيْرَ مُشْرِكِينَ بِهِ وَمَن يُشْرِكْ بِٱللَّهِ فَكَأَنَّمَا خَرَّ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ فَتَخْطَفُهُ ٱلطَّيْرُ أَوْ تَهْوِي بِهِ ٱلرِّيحُ فِي مَكَانٍ سَحِيقٍ,being hanīfs to God being of those who have submitted to God inclining away from every religion except His religion not ascribing partners to Him this clause emphasises the preceding one both clauses being circumstantial qualifiers referring to the third person plural indicator wāw of ijtanibū ‘avoid’. For whoever ascribes partners to God it is as though he had fallen from the heaven and been snatched away by vulture birds that is as though they had seized him swiftly or as though the wind had blown him dropped him into a far-off place so that there is no hope of his being saved.
ذٰلِكَ وَمَن يُعَظِّمْ شَعَائِرَ ٱللَّهِ فَإِنَّهَا مِن تَقْوَى ٱلْقُلُوبِ,That dhālika an implied subject al-amru ‘the matter is’ is taken to precede this predicate. And whoever venerates the sacraments of God then that in other words then that veneration of them — namely of the beasts of sacrifice offered in the Sanctuary after the best of them have been selected and fattened — derives from the piety of the hearts of those individuals. These sacraments are called sha‘ā’ir because they are marked out ish‘ār with something to indicate that they are offerings such as having a hump pierced with a piece of metal.
لَكُمْ فِيهَا مَنَافِعُ إِلَىٰ أَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّى ثُمَّ مَحِلُّهَآ إِلَىٰ ٱلْبَيْتِ ٱلْعَتِيقِ,You may benefit from them such as riding on them and carrying your loads on them in a way that does not harm them until a specified time the time for its immolation. Thereafter its lawful sacrifice that is the site where its immolation becomes due is by the Ancient House meaning the entire Meccan Sanctuary.
وَلِكُلِّ أُمَّةٍ جَعَلْنَا مَنسَكاً لِّيَذْكُرُواْ ٱسْمَ ٱللَّهِ عَلَىٰ مَا رَزَقَهُمْ مِّن بَهِيمَةِ ٱلأَنْعَامِ فَإِلَـٰهُكُمْ إِلَـٰهٌ وَاحِدٌ فَلَهُ أَسْلِمُواْ وَبَشِّرِ ٱلْمُخْبِتِينَ,And for every community that is for every believing group that came before you We have appointed a holy rite read mansakan as the verbal noun ‘ritual’ or mansikan as a noun denoting the site for a rite in other words for every community We have appointed a sacrificial slaughter or the site for such a ritual that they might mention God’s Name over the livestock that He has provided them at the point of slaughtering them. For your God is One God so submit yield to Him. And give good tidings to the humbly obedient
ٱلَّذِينَ إِذَا ذُكِرَ ٱللَّهُ وَجِلَتْ قُلُوبُهُمْ وَٱلصَّٰبِرِينَ عَلَىٰ مَآ أَصَابَهُمْ وَٱلْمُقِيمِي ٱلصَّلَٰوةِ وَمِمَّا رَزَقْنَٰهُمْ يُنفِقُونَ,who when God is mentioned their hearts tremble fear and who endure patiently whatever may befall them of ordeals and who observe prayer at its appointed times and who from that which We have provided them expend from it give voluntary alms.
وَٱلْبُدْنَ جَعَلْنَاهَا لَكُمْ مِّن شَعَائِرِ ٱللَّهِ لَكُمْ فِيهَا خَيْرٌ فَٱذْكُرُواْ ٱسْمَ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْهَا صَوَآفَّ فَإِذَا وَجَبَتْ جُنُوبُهَا فَكُلُواْ مِنْهَا وَأَطْعِمُواْ ٱلْقَانِعَ وَٱلْمُعْتَرَّ كَذٰلِكَ سَخَّرْنَاهَا لَكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ,And as for the sacrificial camels al-budn plural of badana which are ‘camels’ — We have appointed them for you as one of God’s sacraments the ritual ceremonies of His religion. There is good for you in them benefit for you in this world as already mentioned and a reward in the Hereafter. So mention God’s Name over them at the point of immolating them when they are lined up standing on three legs with the left foreleg hobbled. Then when their flanks have collapsed fallen to the ground after immolation — which is the time when one may eat of them — eat of them if you wish and feed the self-contained beggar al-qāni‘ a beggar who is content with what he is given neither asking nor approaching people and the suppliant al-mu‘tarr a beggar who asks for charity or approaches people for that purpose. So that is similar to such a disposal We have disposed them for you that it may be immolated or ridden — for otherwise it would not have been possible — that perhaps you might be thankful for My graces to you.
لَن يَنَالَ ٱللَّهَ لُحُومُهَا وَلاَ دِمَآؤُهَا وَلَـٰكِن يَنَالُهُ ٱلتَّقْوَىٰ مِنكُمْ كَذٰلِكَ سَخَّرَهَا لَكُمْ لِتُكَبِّرُواْ ٱللَّهَ عَلَىٰ مَا هَدَاكُمْ وَبَشِّرِ ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,Neither their flesh nor their blood shall reach God that is neither of these shall be raised up to Him; rather it is your piety that shall reach Him that is it is your righteous action performed purely for Him together with your faith that shall be raised up to Him. Thus has He disposed them for you that you may magnify God for His guiding you for His pointing out to you the ritual ceremonies of His religion and the rites of His pilgrimage. And give good tidings to the virtuous namely those who affirm the Oneness of God.
إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُدَافِعُ عَنِ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُوۤاْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لاَ يُحِبُّ كُلَّ خَوَّانٍ كَفُورٍ,Indeed God protects those who believe against the ruinous misguidance of idolaters. Indeed God does not love the treacherous with regard to what is entrusted to him the ungrateful for His grace — these are the idolaters —in other words He will punish them.
أُذِنَ لِلَّذِينَ يُقَاتَلُونَ بِأَنَّهُمْ ظُلِمُواْ وَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلَىٰ نَصْرِهِمْ لَقَدِيرٌ,Permission is granted to those who fight namely to the believers to fight back — this was the first verse to be revealed regarding the struggle in the way of God jihād because they have been wronged as a result of the wrong done to them by the disbelievers. And God is truly able to help them;
ٱلَّذِينَ أُخْرِجُواْ مِن دِيَارِهِم بِغَيْرِ حَقٍّ إِلاَّ أَن يَقُولُواْ رَبُّنَا ٱللَّهُ وَلَوْلاَ دَفْعُ ٱللَّهِ ٱلنَّاسَ بَعْضَهُمْ بِبَعْضٍ لَّهُدِّمَتْ صَوَامِعُ وَبِيَعٌ وَصَلَوَاتٌ وَمَسَاجِدُ يُذْكَرُ فِيهَا ٱسمُ ٱللَّهِ كَثِيراً وَلَيَنصُرَنَّ ٱللَّهُ مَن يَنصُرُهُ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَقَوِيٌّ عَزِيزٌ,they are those who were expelled from their homes without right for their expulsion; they were expelled only because they said that is because of their saying ‘Our Lord is God’ alone such a saying is ‘right’ and so then to be expelled for saying it is to be expelled without right. Were it not for God’s causing some people ba‘dahum ‘some’ substitutes for al-nāsa ‘people’ to drive back others destruction would have befallen read la-huddimat to emphasise a great number of destructions; or read la-hudimat the monasteries sawāmi‘ is for monks and churches kanā’is are for Christians and synagogues salawāt is the Hebrew term for Jewish houses of worship kanā’is and mosques masājid are for Muslims in which that is in which mentioned places God’s Name is mentioned greatly and with such destruction acts of worship cease. Assuredly God will help those who help Him that is who help His religion. God is truly Strong overpowering His creation Mighty Invincible in terms of His dominion and power;
ٱلَّذِينَ إِنْ مَّكَّنَّاهُمْ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ أَقَامُواْ ٱلصَّلاَةَ وَآتَوُاْ ٱلزَّكَـاةَ وَأَمَرُواْ بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ وَنَهَوْاْ عَنِ ٱلْمُنْكَرِ وَلِلَّهِ عَاقِبَةُ ٱلأُمُورِ,those who if We empower them in the land by granting them victory over their enemies maintain the prayer and pay the alms and enjoin decency and forbid indecency this last is the response to the conditional clause which together with the response constitute a relative clause of the relative noun ‘those who’; hum ‘they are’ may be taken as the implied subject before this. And with God rests the outcome of all matters in other words to Him these matters return in the Hereafter.
وَإِن يُكَذِّبُوكَ فَقَدْ كَذَّبَتْ قَبْلَهُمْ قَوْمُ نُوحٍ وَعَادٌ وَثَمُودُ,And if they deny you — these words to the end of the statement are meant to comfort the Prophet s — the people of Noah denied before them kadhdhabat in the feminine person on the basis of the overall import and ‘Ād the people of Hūd and Thamūd the people of Sālih
وَقَوْمُ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَقَوْمُ لُوطٍ,as well as the people of Abraham and the people of Lot
وَأَصْحَابُ مَدْيَنَ وَكُذِّبَ مُوسَىٰ فَأمْلَيْتُ لِلْكَافِرِينَ ثُمَّ أَخَذْتُهُمْ فَكَيْفَ كَانَ نَكِيرِ,and the inhabitants of Midian the people of Shu‘ayb and Moses was also denied he was denied by the native Egyptians al-qibt and not by his people the Children of Israel. In other words all of those people denied their messengers so take them these messengers as a good example of constancy. And I granted the disbelievers respite I postponed dealing with them by deferring their requital then I seized them with chastisement and how terrible was My abhorrence! nakīr that is to say My rebuke inkār of them for their denial by My destroying them the interrogative is meant as an affirmative in other words it My chastisement was well-placed.
فَكَأَيِّن مِّن قَرْيَةٍ أَهْلَكْنَاهَا وَهِيَ ظَالِمَةٌ فَهِيَ خَاوِيَةٌ عَلَىٰ عُرُوشِهَا وَبِئْرٍ مُّعَطَّلَةٍ وَقَصْرٍ مَّشِيدٍ,How many a town I have destroyed ahlaktuhā a variant reading has ahlaknāhā ‘We have destroyed’ while it was doing wrong that is while its inhabitants were doing wrong by being disbelievers but now it lies fallen down collapsed on its roofs and how many a neglected well abandoned because of the death of its owners and a lofty palace stands empty because of the death of its residents.
أَفَلَمْ يَسِيرُواْ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ فَتَكُونَ لَهُمْ قُلُوبٌ يَعْقِلُونَ بِهَآ أَوْ آذَانٌ يَسْمَعُونَ بِهَا فَإِنَّهَا لاَ تَعْمَى ٱلأَبْصَارُ وَلَـٰكِن تَعْمَىٰ ٱلْقُلُوبُ ٱلَّتِي فِي ٱلصُّدُورِ,Have they namely the disbelievers of Mecca not travelled in the land so that they may have hearts with which to comprehend what befell deniers before them or ears with which to hear? the stories of how they were destroyed and their dwelling-places were ruined and so take heed? Indeed it is not the eyes that turn blind but it is the hearts that turn blind within the breasts allatī fī’l-sudūr for emphasis.
وَيَسْتَعْجِلُونَكَ بِٱلْعَذَابِ وَلَن يُخْلِفَ ٱللَّهُ وَعْدَهُ وَإِنَّ يَوْماً عِندَ رَبِّكَ كَأَلْفِ سَنَةٍ مِّمَّا تَعُدُّونَ,And they ask you to hasten the chastisement even though God would never break His promise of sending down the chastisement upon them — and so He sent it down on the day of Badr. And truly a day with your Lord of the days of the Hereafter on account of the severity of the chastisement is like a thousand years of your counting read ta‘uddūna or ya‘uddūna ‘their counting’ in this world.
وَكَأَيِّن مِّن قَرْيَةٍ أَمْلَيْتُ لَهَا وَهِيَ ظَالِمَةٌ ثُمَّ أَخَذْتُهَا وَإِلَيَّ ٱلْمَصِيرُ,To how many a town did I give respite while it was doing wrong; but then I seized it meaning I seized its inhabitants and with Me lies the journey’s end the final return.
قُلْ يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّاسُ إِنَّمَآ أَنَاْ لَكُمْ نَذِيرٌ مُّبِينٌ,Say ‘O mankind that is O people of Mecca I am only a manifest warner to you’ one whose warning is plain; but also I am a giver of good tidings to the believers.
فَٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ لَهُمْ مَّغْفِرَةٌ وَرِزْقٌ كَرِيمٌ,And so those who believe and perform righteous deeds — for them there shall be forgiveness of their sins and a glorious provision namely Paradise.
وَٱلَّذِينَ سَعَوْاْ فِيۤ آيَاتِنَا مُعَاجِزِينَ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ أَصْحَابُ ٱلْجَحِيمِ,But those who strive against Our signs namely the Qur’ān in order to invalidate them seeking to incapacitate mu‘ajjizīna those who follow the Prophet this meaning of mu‘ajjizīna being derived from their assumption that these followers are incapable individuals and impeding them from practising their faith; or mu‘ajjizīna means supposing Us to be incapable against them a variant reading of mu‘ajjizīna has mu‘ājizīna meaning ‘contending with Us’ that is to say they suppose that they will be able to elude Us by denying resurrection and requital — those they shall be the inhabitants of hell-fire.
وَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رَّسُولٍ وَلاَ نَبِيٍّ إِلاَّ إِذَا تَمَنَّىٰ أَلْقَى ٱلشَّيْطَانُ فِيۤ أُمْنِيَّتِهِ فَيَنسَخُ ٱللَّهُ مَا يُلْقِي ٱلشَّيْطَانُ ثُمَّ يُحْكِمُ ٱللَّهُ آيَاتِهِ وَٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ حَكِيمٌ,And We did not send before you any messenger rasūl — this is a prophet who has been commanded to deliver a Message — or prophet nabī — one who has not been commanded to deliver anything — but that when he recited the scripture Satan cast into his recitation what is not from the Qur’ān but which those to whom he the prophet had been sent would find pleasing. The Prophet s had during an assembly of the men of Quraysh after reciting the following verses from sūrat al-Najm Have you considered Lāt and ‘Uzzā? And Manāt the third one? 5319-20 added as a result of Satan casting them onto his tongue without his the Prophet’s being aware of it the following words ‘those are the high-flying cranes al-gharānīq al-‘ulā and indeed their intercession is to be hoped for’ and so they the men of Quraysh were thereby delighted. Gabriel however later informed him the Prophet of this that Satan had cast onto his tongue and he was grieved by it; but was subsequently comforted with this following verse that he might be reassured of God’s pleasure thereat God abrogates nullifies whatever Satan had cast then God confirms His revelations. And God is Knower of Satan’s casting of that which has been mentioned Wise in His enabling him Satan to do such things for He does whatever He will.
لِّيَجْعَلَ مَا يُلْقِي ٱلشَّيْطَانُ فِتْنَةً لِّلَّذِينَ فِي قُلُوبِهِم مَّرَضٌ وَٱلْقَاسِيَةِ قُلُوبُهُمْ وَإِنَّ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ لَفِي شِقَاقٍ بَعِيدٍ,That He may make what Satan has cast a trial a test for those in whose hearts is a sickness dissension and hypocrisy and those whose hearts are hardened namely the idolaters hardened against acceptance of the truth. For truly the evildoers the disbelievers are steeped in extreme defiance in a protracted feud with the Prophet s and the believers for his tongue uttered mention of their gods in a way that pleased them and yet this was later nullified.
وَلِيَعْلَمَ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ ٱلْعِلْمَ أَنَّهُ ٱلْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّكَ فَيُؤْمِنُواْ بِهِ فَتُخْبِتَ لَهُ قُلُوبُهُمْ وَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَهَادِ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُوۤاْ إِلَىٰ صِرَاطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ,And that those who have been given knowledge of God’s Oneness and the Qur’ān may know that it the Qur’ān is the truth from your Lord so that they may believe therein and their hearts may find reassurance in it. And assuredly God guides those who believe to a straight path a straight route namely the religion of Islam.
وَلاَ يَزَالُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ فِي مِرْيَةٍ مِّنْهُ حَتَّىٰ تَأْتِيَهُمُ ٱلسَّاعَةُ بَغْتَةً أَوْ يَأْتِيَهُمْ عَذَابُ يَوْمٍ عَقِيمٍ,And those who disbelieve will not cease to be in doubt of it that is the Qur’ān — because of what Satan had cast onto the tongue of the Prophet s and what had thereafter been nullified — until the Hour comes upon them unawares that is the Hour of their death or of resurrection comes upon them suddenly or there come upon them the chastisement of a day of desolation ‘aqīm namely the day of Badr which held nothing of good for disbelievers much like a sterile wind rīh ‘aqīm that bears no good; or it means the Day of Resurrection referred to as ‘desolate’ because thereafter there will be no more night.
ٱلْمُلْكُ يَوْمَئِذٍ للَّهِ يَحْكُمُ بَيْنَهُمْ فَٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ فِي جَنَّاتِ ٱلنَّعِيمِ,Sovereignty on that day namely on the Day of Resurrection will be God’s alone the sense of God’s ‘consolidation’ of sovereignty on that Day suggested by the clause renders the adverbial qualifier yawma’idhin ‘on that day’ into accusative dependent status. He will judge between them between believers and disbelievers in the way that He explains next Then those who believed and performed righteous deeds will be in Gardens of Bliss as a bounty from God
وَٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَكَذَّبُواْ بِآيٰتِنَا فَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ مُّهِينٌ,while those who disbelieved and denied Our signs for them will be a humiliating chastisement a severe one because of their disbelief.
وَٱلَّذِينَ هَاجَرُواْ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ ثُمَّ قُتِلُوۤاْ أَوْ مَاتُواْ لَيَرْزُقَنَّهُمُ ٱللَّهُ رِزْقاً حَسَناً وَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَهُوَ خَيْرُ ٱلرَّازِقِينَ,And those who emigrated in the way of God that is in obedience to Him from emigrating from Mecca to Medina and then were slain or died God shall provide them with a good provision namely the provision of Paradise. Truly God is the best of providers the most excellent of givers.
لَيُدْخِلَنَّهُمْ مُّدْخَلاً يَرْضَوْنَهُ وَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَعَلِيمٌ حَلِيمٌ,Assuredly He will admit them into a place read mudkhalan or madkhalan respectively signifying the means of entry or the place entered that is pleasing to them and that is Paradise. And truly God is Knowing of their intentions Forbearing in refraining from punishing them.
ذٰلِكَ وَمَنْ عَاقَبَ بِمِثْلِ مَا عُوقِبَ بِهِ ثُمَّ بُغِيَ عَلَيْهِ لَيَنصُرَنَّهُ ٱللَّهُ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَعَفُوٌّ غَفُورٌ,That which We have related to you is so. And whoever retaliates whoever from among the believers requites with the like of what he was made to suffer at the hands of the idolaters wrongfully that is whoever fights against them if they fight against him during the sacred month and then is again made to suffer aggression by them that is to say he is again wronged by being expelled from his house God will surely help him. Indeed God is Pardoning to believers Forgiving them their engaging in combat during the sacred month.
ذٰلِكَ بِأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُولِجُ ٱللَّيْلَ فِي ٱلنَّهَارِ وَيُولِجُ ٱلنَّهَارَ فِي ٱللَّيْلِ وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ سَمِيعٌ بَصِيرٌ,That help is because God makes the night pass into the day and makes the day pass into the night that is to say He makes each enter into the other by increasing the one and decreasing the other which is a sign of His power exalted be He the same power that produces His help and because God is Hearer of the supplications of believers Seer of them giving them faith and responding to their supplications.
ذٰلِكَ بِأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ هُوَ ٱلْحَقُّ وَأَنَّ مَا يَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِهِ هُوَ ٱلْبَاطِلُ وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ هُوَ ٱلْعَلِيُّ ٱلْكَبِيرُ,That help also is because God He is the Truth the Established Truth and what they call on yad‘ūna; also read tad‘ūna ‘you call on’ what they worship besides Him namely idols that is the False the transient and because God He is the High the One supreme above all things in His power the Great besides Whom all things are insignificant.
أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ أَنزَلَ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مَآءً فَتُصْبِحُ ٱلأَرْضُ مُخْضَرَّةً إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَطِيفٌ خَبِيرٌ,Have you not seen realised that God sends down water rain from the heaven whereupon the earth turns green with plants — and this too is a sign of His power. Indeed God is Subtle in dealing with His servants when He brings forth plants through water Aware of what is in their hearts when the rain is delayed.
لَّهُ مَا فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَهُوَ ٱلْغَنِيُّ ٱلْحَمِيدُ,To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth in terms of ownership. Surely God He is Independent of His servants Praiseworthy to His friends.
أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ سَخَّرَ لَكُم مَّا فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَٱلْفُلْكَ تَجْرِي فِي ٱلْبَحْرِ بِأَمْرِهِ وَيُمْسِكُ ٱلسَّمَآءَ أَن تَقَعَ عَلَى ٱلأَرْضِ إِلاَّ بِإِذْنِهِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ بِٱلنَّاسِ لَرَءُوفٌ رَّحِيمٌ,Have you not seen realised that God has disposed for you all that is in the earth of beasts and that the ships run upon the sea for transport and to carry loads by His command by His leave and He holds back the heaven lest it should fall on the earth save when it may do so by His leave and you are destroyed. Surely God is with mankind Gentle Merciful in disposing things for them and holding others back from them.
وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِيۤ أَحْيَاكُمْ ثُمَّ يُمِيتُكُمْ ثُمَّ يُحْيِيكُمْ إِنَّ ٱلإِنْسَانَ لَكَفُورٌ,And He it is Who gave you life by originating you then He will cause you to die upon the conclusion of your terms of life then He will give you life again at the Resurrection. Truly man that is truly the idolater is very ungrateful for God’s graces by neglecting to affirm His Oneness.
لِّكُلِّ أُمَّةٍ جَعَلْنَا مَنسَكاً هُمْ نَاسِكُوهُ فَلاَ يُنَازِعُنَّكَ فِي ٱلأَمْرِ وَٱدْعُ إِلَىٰ رَبِّكَ إِنَّكَ لَعَلَىٰ هُدًى مُّسْتَقِيمٍ,For every community We have appointed a holy rite read mansakan or mansikan a Holy Law which they are to observe which they are to implement. So do not let them dispute with you the intended meaning is ‘do not dispute with them’ about the matter namely the matter of the slaughter animal when they said ‘What God has killed is worthier for you to eat than what you killed’; but summon people to your Lord to His religion. Indeed you follow a straight guidance a straight religion.
وَإِن جَادَلُوكَ فَقُلِ ٱللَّهُ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ,And if they dispute with you in the matter of religion say ‘God knows best what you do and will requite you for it — this was revealed before the command to fight them.
ٱللَّهُ يَحْكُمُ بَيْنَكُمْ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ فِيمَا كُنتُمْ فِيهِ تَخْتَلِفُونَ,God will judge between you O believers and disbelievers on the Day of Resurrection concerning that wherein you used to differ’ when each of the two parties would say the opposite of what the other said.
أَلَمْ تَعْلَمْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَعْلَمُ مَا فِي ٱلسَّمَآءِ وَٱلأَرْضِ إِنَّ ذٰلِكَ فِي كِتَابٍ إِنَّ ذٰلِكَ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ يَسِيرٌ,Do you not know the interrogative here is meant as an affirmative that God knows all that is in the heaven and the earth? Truly that which has been mentioned is recorded in a Book namely the Preserved Tablet al-lawh al-mahfūz. Indeed that namely the knowledge of what has been mentioned is easy for God.
وَيَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ مَا لَمْ يُنَزِّلْ بِهِ سُلْطَاناً وَمَا لَيْسَ لَهُمْ بِهِ عِلْمٌ وَمَا لِلظَّالِمِينَ مِن نَّصِيرٍ,And they the idolaters worship besides God that namely idols for which He has never revealed any warrant any definitive proof and that of which they have no knowledge when they claim that these are gods. And those who do evil by way of practising idolatry shall have no helper to protect them against God’s chastisement.
وَإِذَا تُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْهِمْ آيَاتُنَا بَيِّنَاتٍ تَعْرِفُ فِي وُجُوهِ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ ٱلْمُنْكَرَ يَكَادُونَ يَسْطُونَ بِٱلَّذِينَ يَتْلُونَ عَلَيْهِمْ آيَٰتِنَا قُلْ أَفَأُنَبِّئُكُم بِشَرٍّ مِّن ذٰلِكُمُ ٱلنَّارُ وَعَدَهَا ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَبِئْسَ ٱلْمَصِيرُ,And when Our signs in the Qur’ān are recited to them though they are clear manifest signs bayyinātin a circumstantial qualifier you perceive on the faces of those who disbelieve denial that is to say denial of these signs in other words you perceive the effect of such denial in the way of aversion and frowning. They would almost pounce upon those who recite Our signs to them that is they would almost fall upon them in assault. Say ‘Shall I inform you about something worse than that? something more repulsive to you than the Qur’ān that is being recited to you? It is The Fire! God has promised it to the disbelievers in that their journey’s end shall be to it. And it is an evil journey’s end!’
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّاسُ ضُرِبَ مَثَلٌ فَٱسْتَمِعُواْ لَهُ إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ تَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ لَن يَخْلُقُواْ ذُبَاباً وَلَوِ ٱجْتَمَعُواْ لَهُ وَإِن يَسْلُبْهُمُ ٱلذُّبَابُ شَيْئاً لاَّ يَسْتَنقِذُوهُ مِنْهُ ضَعُفَ ٱلطَّالِبُ وَٱلْمَطْلُوبُ,O mankind that is to say O people of Mecca a similitude is being struck so listen to it and it is that truly those on whom you call whom you worship besides God that is other than Him and these are the idols will never create a fly dhubāb is a generic noun the singular of which is dhubāba for both the masculine and the feminine even if they rallied together to do so to create it. And if a fly should take away something from them such as a drop of the scents or the saffron in which they drench themselves they would not be able to recover that from it because of their complete incapacity so how can they worship those whom they suppose to be partners of God exalted be He? An odd thing — which He has expressed by striking a similitude. Feeble is the seeker the worshipper and the thing sought the thing worshipped!
مَا قَدَرُواْ ٱللَّهَ حَقَّ قَدْرِهِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَقَوِيٌّ عَزِيزٌ,They do not esteem God exalt Him with the esteem He deserves with the exaltedness He deserves for they ascribe to Him partners who can neither protect themselves from a fly nor retaliate against it. Truly God is Strong Mighty Victor.
ٱللَّهُ يَصْطَفِي مِنَ ٱلْمَلاَئِكَةِ رُسُلاً وَمِنَ ٱلنَّاسِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ سَمِيعٌ بَصِيرٌ,God chooses from the angels messengers and also chooses from mankind messengers — this was revealed after the idolaters said Has the Remembrance been revealed to him out of all of us? Q. 388. Truly God is Hearer of what they say Seer of those whom He chooses as messengers such as Gabriel Michael Abraham Muhammad (s) and others may God bless them and grant them peace.
يَعْلَمُ مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ وَإِلَى ٱللَّهِ تُرْجَعُ ٱلأُمُورُ,He knows that which is before them and that which is behind them in other words what they have offered in the way of deeds and what they have left behind and what they have done and what they will do next; and to God all matters are returned.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ ٱرْكَعُواْ وَٱسْجُدُواْ وَاعْبُدُواْ رَبَّكُمْ وَٱفْعَلُواْ ٱلْخَيْرَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ,O you who believe bow down and prostrate yourselves in other words perform prayer and worship your Lord affirm His Oneness and do good such as showing kindness to kin and the adoption of noble traits that perhaps you may be prosperous that perhaps you may secure everlasting life in Paradise.
وَجَاهِدُوا فِي ٱللَّهِ حَقَّ جِهَادِهِ هُوَ ٱجْتَبَاكُمْ وَمَا جَعَلَ عَلَيْكُمْ فِي ٱلدِّينِ مِنْ حَرَجٍ مِّلَّةَ أَبِيكُمْ إِبْرَاهِيمَ هُوَ سَمَّاكُمُ ٱلْمُسْلِمِينَ مِن قَبْلُ وَفِي هَـٰذَا لِيَكُونَ ٱلرَّسُولُ شَهِيداً عَلَيْكُمْ وَتَكُونُواْ شُهَدَآءَ عَلَى ٱلنَّاسِ فَأَقِيمُواْ ٱلصَّلاَةَ وَآتُواْ ٱلزَّكَـاةَ وَٱعْتَصِمُواْ بِٱللَّهِ هُوَ مَوْلاَكُمْ فَنِعْمَ ٱلْمَوْلَىٰ وَنِعْمَ ٱلنَّصِيرُ,And struggle in the way of God in order to establish His religion a struggle worthy of Him by expending all effort therein haqqa is in the accusative because it is a verbal noun. He has elected you He has chosen you for His religion and has not laid upon you in your religion any hardship that is any constraint for He has facilitated adherence to it during times of difficulty such as His permitting you to shorten prayers to seek ritual purification from earth to eat of carrion and to break the fast during illness or travel — the creed of your father millata is in the accusative because the genitive preposition kāf sc. ka-millati ‘like the creed of’ has been omitted Abraham Ibrāhīma an explicative supplement. He that is God named you Muslims before that is before the revelation of this Book and in this that is in the Qur’ān so that the Messenger might be a witness against you on the Day of Resurrection that he delivered the Message to you and that you might be witnesses against mankind that their messengers delivered the Message to them. So maintain prayer observe it regularly and pay the alms and hold fast to God trust in Him. He is your Patron your Helper and the Guardian of your affairs. An excellent Patron is He and an excellent Helper for you.
قَدْ أَفْلَحَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ,Indeed qad is for confirmation prosperous victorious are the believers
ٱلَّذِينَ هُمْ فِي صَلاَتِهِمْ خَاشِعُونَ,those who in their prayers are humble
وَٱلَّذِينَ هُمْ عَنِ ٱللَّغْوِ مُّعْرِضُونَ,and who shun vain talk and other nonsense
وَٱلَّذِينَ هُمْ لِلزَّكَـاةِ فَاعِلُونَ,and who fulfil payment of alms
وَٱلَّذِينَ هُمْ لِفُرُوجِهِمْ حَافِظُونَ,and who guard their private parts against what is unlawful
إِلاَّ عَلَىٰ أَزْوَاجِهِمْ أَوْ مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُهُمْ فَإِنَّهُمْ غَيْرُ مَلُومِينَ,except from their spouses that is to their spouses and what slaves their right hands possess that is concubines for then they are not blameworthy in having sexual intercourse with them.
فَمَنِ ٱبْتَغَىٰ وَرَآءَ ذٰلِكَ فَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْعَادُونَ,But whoever seeks anything beyond that intercourse with wives and concubines such as masturbation those they are transgressors who have overstepped the bounds into what is not lawful for them.
وَٱلَّذِينَ هُمْ لأَمَانَاتِهِمْ وَعَهْدِهِمْ رَاعُونَ,And who are keepers of their trusts may be read as plural amānātihim ‘their trusts’ or singular amānatihim ‘their trust’ and covenants made between them or between them and God such as the observance of prayer and so on.
وَٱلَّذِينَ هُمْ عَلَىٰ صَلَوَاتِهِمْ يُحَافِظُونَ,And who are watchful of their prayers may be read as plural salawātihim ‘their prayers’ or singular salātihim ‘their prayer’ observing them at their appointed times.
أُوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْوَارِثُونَ,Those they are the inheritors and none other than them
ٱلَّذِينَ يَرِثُونَ ٱلْفِرْدَوْسَ هُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ,who shall inherit Paradise al-firdaws the name of a garden the highest of the gardens of Heaven — wherein they will abide; herein is an allusion to the Return in the Hereafter and so it is fitting that the Beginning of creation should be mentioned next
وَلَقَدْ خَلَقْنَا ٱلإِنْسَانَ مِن سُلاَلَةٍ مِّن طِينٍ,And by God We certainly created man Adam from an extraction min sulālatin derives from the verbal expression salaltu’l-shay’a mina’l-shay’ ‘I drew one thing out of another’ meaning ‘I extracted it therefrom’ his Adam’s substance being of clay min tīnin is semantically connected to sulālatin ‘an extraction’.
ثُمَّ جَعَلْنَاهُ نُطْفَةً فِي قَرَارٍ مَّكِينٍ,Then We made him namely man the progeny of Adam a drop a sperm-drop in a secure lodging which is the womb.
ثُمَّ خَلَقْنَا ٱلنُّطْفَةَ عَلَقَةً فَخَلَقْنَا ٱلْعَلَقَةَ مُضْغَةً فَخَلَقْنَا ٱلْمُضْغَةَ عِظَاماً فَكَسَوْنَا ٱلْعِظَامَ لَحْماً ثُمَّ أَنشَأْنَاهُ خَلْقاً آخَرَ فَتَبَارَكَ ٱللَّهُ أَحْسَنُ ٱلْخَالِقِينَ,Then We transformed the drop of semen into a clot congealed blood. Then We transformed the clot into a little lump of flesh mudgha a piece of flesh about the size of what one would be able to chew mā yumdagh. Then We transformed the lump of flesh into bones. Then We clothed the bones with flesh a variant reading in both instances instead of the plurals ‘izāman and al-‘izāma ‘the bones’ is singular ‘azman and ‘al-‘azma ‘the bone’; and in all three instances above khalaqnā means ‘We made it become’ as opposed to ‘We created’. Then We produced him as yet another creature by breathing into him Our Spirit. So blessed be God the best of creators! that is the best of determiners the specificier noun for ahsana ‘the best’ has been omitted because it is obvious khalqan ‘in terms of creation’.
ثُمَّ إِنَّكُمْ بَعْدَ ذٰلِكَ لَمَيِّتُونَ,Then indeed after that you die.
ثُمَّ إِنَّكُمْ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ تُبْعَثُونَ,Then on the Day of Resurrection you shall surely be raised for reckoning and requital.
وَلَقَدْ خَلَقْنَا فَوْقَكُمْ سَبْعَ طَرَآئِقَ وَمَا كُنَّا عَنِ ٱلْخَلْقِ غَافِلِينَ,And verily We created above you seven paths that is seven heavens tarā’iq is the plural of tarīqa so called because they are the paths used by the angels and of creation that lies beneath these paths We are never unmindful lest these should fall upon them and destroy them. Nay but We hold them back as stated in the verse And He holds back the heaven lest it should fall upon the earth Q. 2265.
وَأَنزَلْنَا مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مَآءً بِقَدَرٍ فَأَسْكَنَّٰهُ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَإِنَّا عَلَىٰ ذَهَابٍ بِهِ لَقَٰدِرُونَ,And We sent down water out of the heaven in measure that suffices them and We lodged it within the earth; and We are indeed able to take it away so that they die of thirst together with their livestock.
فَأَنشَأْنَا لَكُمْ بِهِ جَنَّاتٍ مِّن نَّخِيلٍ وَأَعْنَابٍ لَّكُمْ فِيهَا فَوَاكِهُ كَثِيرَةٌ وَمِنْهَا تَأْكُلُونَ,Then We produced for you therewith gardens of date palms and vines — these being the most common fruits of the Arabs — wherein is abundant fruit for you and whereof you eat in summer and winter.
وَشَجَرَةً تَخْرُجُ مِن طُورِ سَيْنَآءَ تَنبُتُ بِٱلدُّهْنِ وَصِبْغٍ لِّلآكِلِيِنَ,And We produced a tree that grows on Mount of Sinai read Sīnā’ or Saynā’ indeclinable as it is a proper noun with the feminine ending denoting a location that produces read either as tunbitu from the fourth form anbata or as tanbutu from the trilateral form nabata oil bi’l-duhni in the case of the former reading of tunbitu the bā’ bi- here would be extra whereas in the case of the second reading of tanbutu it would be a preposition needed for the transitive — and this tree is the olive tree and seasoning for those who eat wa-sibghin li’l-ākilīna a supplement to bi’l-duhni ‘oil’ that is to say it is like a dye that colours a morsel dipped in it — and this seasoning is the olive oil.
وَإِنَّ لَكُمْ فِي ٱلأَنْعَامِ لَعِبْرَةً نُّسْقِيكُمْ مِّمَّا فِي بُطُونِهَا وَلَكُمْ فيِهَا مَنَافِعُ كَثِيرَةٌ وَمِنْهَا تَأْكُلُونَ,And surely in the cattle that is in camels cows and sheep there is for you a lesson an admonition for you to heed. We give you to drink read nasqīkum or nusqīkum of what is in their bellies of milk and you have many uses in them such as the extraction of wool fur and hairs and other uses and you eat of them.
وَعَلَيْهَا وَعَلَى ٱلْفُلْكِ تُحْمَلُونَ,And on them the camels and on ships you are carried.
وَلَقَدْ أَرْسَلْنَا نُوحاً إِلَىٰ قَوْمِهِ فَقَالَ يٰقَوْمِ ٱعْبُدُواْ ٱللَّهَ مَا لَكُمْ مِّنْ إِلَـٰهٍ غَيْرُهُ أَفَلاَ تَتَّقُونَ,And verily We sent Noah to his people and he said ‘O my people worship God obey God and affirm His Oneness. You have no other god besides Him ghayruhu is the subject of mā ‘no’; the preceding min ilāhin ‘god’ is the predicate the min being extra. Will you not then fear?’ His punishment in worshipping gods other than Him?
فَقَالَ ٱلْمَلأُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِن قَوْمِهِ مَا هَـٰذَا إِلاَّ بَشَرٌ مِّثْلُكُمْ يُرِيدُ أَن يَتَفَضَّلَ عَلَيْكُمْ وَلَوْ شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ لأَنزَلَ مَلاَئِكَةً مَّا سَمِعْنَا بِهَـٰذَا فِيۤ آبَآئِنَا ٱلأَوَّلِينَ,But the council of his people who disbelieved said to their followers ‘This is just a human being like you who desires to gain superiority to have the honour over you by acquiring followers you being his followers. And had God willed that none other than Him be worshipped He would have sent down angels with that Message and not assigned a human being for it. We never heard of such an affirmation of God’s Oneness as that which Noah summons us among our forefathers among past communities.
إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ رَجُلٌ بِهِ جِنَّةٌ فَتَرَبَّصُواْ بِهِ حَتَّىٰ حِينٍ,He Noah is just a man possessed by madness a case of dementia. So bear with him for a while’ until he dies.
قَالَ رَبِّ ٱنصُرْنِي بِمَا كَذَّبُونِ,He Noah said ‘My Lord help me against them because they deny me’ because of their denial of me by destroying them. God exalted be He says responding to his supplication
فَأَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَيْهِ أَنِ ٱصْنَعِ ٱلْفُلْكَ بِأَعْيُنِنَا وَوَحْيِنَا فَإِذَا جَآءَ أَمْرُنَا وَفَارَ ٱلتَّنُّورُ فَٱسْلُكْ فِيهَا مِن كُلٍّ زَوْجَيْنِ ٱثْنَيْنِ وَأَهْلَكَ إِلاَّ مَن سَبَقَ عَلَيْهِ ٱلْقَوْلُ مِنْهُمْ وَلاَ تُخَاطِبْنِي فِي ٱلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوۤاْ إِنَّهُمْ مُّغْرَقُونَ,So We revealed to him saying ‘Build the Ark the ship under Our watch under Our observation and protection and by Our revelation Our command. Then when Our command comes that they be destroyed and the oven of the baker gushes with water — and this was Noah’s sign — bring into it admit into the ship of every kind of animal two mates a male and a female that is two of every species thereof ithnayn is an object; min ‘of’ is semantically connected to usluk ‘bring into it’. According to the story God exalted be He gathered all the beasts of prey and the birds and other animals for Noah. As he Noah pushed forth his hands into each species his right hand would fall upon a male and the left upon a female whereafter he would take them on board the ship a variant reading for min kuli ‘of every’ is min kullin ‘of every kind’ in which case zawjayni ‘two mates’ becomes a direct object with ithnayn ‘two’ being repeated for emphasis thereof; together with your family — his wife ? and children — except for those against whom the Word has already gone forth that they be destroyed namely his wife and his son Canaan Kan‘ān unlike Shem Sām Ham Hām and Japheth Yāfith whom together with their three wives he carried on board. In sūrat Hūd the following is mentioned where Noah is told who he should carry in the ship ‘… and those who believe.’ And none believed with him except a few Q. 1140. It is said that these were six men and their wives. Moreover it is said that all those who were on the ship numbered seventy eight half of them were men and half were women. And do not plead with Me concerning those who have done wrong those who have disbelieved that I should refrain from destroying them. They shall indeed be drowned.
فَإِذَا ٱسْتَوَيْتَ أَنتَ وَمَن مَّعَكَ عَلَى ٱلْفُلْكِ فَقُلِ ٱلْحَمْدُ للَّهِ ٱلَّذِي نَجَّانَا مِنَ ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ,And when you have settled when you are balanced in the Ark together with those with you say “Praise be to God Who has delivered us from the wrongdoing folk” from the disbelievers and the destruction that came upon them.
وَقُل رَّبِّ أَنزِلْنِي مُنزَلاً مُّبَارَكاً وَأَنتَ خَيْرُ ٱلْمُنزِلِينَ,And say upon disembarking from the ship “My Lord cause me to land with a landing read munzalan as the verbal noun as well as the noun of place for ‘landing’; or manzilan as meaning the site of the landing blessed being that landing or place for You are the best of all who bring to land” ’ that which has been mentioned.
إِنَّ فِي ذٰلِكَ لآيَاتٍ وَإِن كُنَّا لَمُبْتَلِينَ,Surely in that mentioned matter of Noah the ship and the destruction of the disbelievers there are signs indicators of God’s power exalted be He and indeed wa-in in has been softened in place of the hardened form its subject being the pronoun of the matter We were putting to the test indeed We were trying the people of Noah by sending him as God’s messenger to them and by his admonitions to them.
ثُمَّ أَنشَأْنَا مِن بَعْدِهِمْ قَرْناً آخَرِينَ,Then after them We brought forth another generation another people namely and these were the people of ‘Ād.
فَأَرْسَلْنَا فِيهِمْ رَسُولاً مِّنْهُمْ أَنِ ٱعْبُدُواْ ٱللَّهَ مَا لَكُمْ مِّنْ إِلَـٰهٍ غَيْرُهُ أَفَلاَ تَتَّقُونَ,And We sent among them a messenger of their own namely Hūd saying ‘Worship God! You have no other god besides Him. Will you not then be wary?’ of His punishment and become believers?
وَقَالَ ٱلْمَلأُ مِن قَوْمِهِ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَكَذَّبُواْ بِلِقَآءِ ٱلآخِرَةِ وَأَتْرَفْنَاهُمْ فِي ٱلْحَيـاةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا مَا هَـٰذَا إِلاَّ بَشَرٌ مِّثْلُكُمْ يَأْكُلُ مِمَّا تَأْكُلُونَ مِنْهُ وَيَشْرَبُ مِمَّا تَشْرَبُونَ,The council of his people who disbelieved and denied the encounter of the Hereafter they denied that they will end up thereat and whom We had given affluence whom We had provided with comforts in the life of this world said ‘This is only a human being like you he eats what you eat and drinks what you drink.
وَلَئِنْ أَطَعْتُمْ بَشَراً مِّثْلَكُمْ إِنَّكُمْ إِذاً لَّخَاسِرُونَ,And by God if you obey a human being like yourselves this clause contains both an oath and a conditional; the response belongs to the former the oath which at the same time suffices in place of a response for the latter the conditional you will surely then that is should you obey them be losers you will have been duped.
أَيَعِدُكُمْ أَنَّكُمْ إِذَا مِتُّمْ وَكُنتُمْ تُرَاباً وَعِظاماً أَنَّكُمْ مُّخْرَجُونَ,Does he promise you that when you have died and become dust and bones you shall be brought forth? mukhrajūna this is the predicate of the first annakum ‘that … you’; the second annakum simply reiterates it because of the long separation between the subject and its predicate.
هَيْهَاتَ هَيْهَاتَ لِمَا تُوعَدُونَ,Far-fetched far-fetched hayhāt is a noun of action in the past tense functioning as a verbal noun meaning ba‘uda ba‘uda ‘far from it far from it!’ is what you are promised! in the way of being brought forth from the graves li-mā the lām is extra for explication.
إِنْ هِيَ إِلاَّ حَيَاتُنَا ٱلدُّنْيَا نَمُوتُ وَنَحْيَا وَمَا نَحْنُ بِمَبْعُوثِينَ,There is nothing that is there is no life but our life in this world we die and we live again only through the lives of our offspring and we shall not be raised again.
إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ رَجُلٌ ٱفتَرَىٰ عَلَىٰ ٱللَّهِ كَذِباً وَمَا نَحْنُ لَهُ بِمُؤْمِنِينَ,He is the Messenger is just a man who has invented a lie against God and we will not believe in him’ we will not accept the truth of resurrection after death.
قَالَ رَبِّ ٱنْصُرْنِي بِمَا كَذَّبُونِ,He said ‘My Lord help me because they have denied me’.
قَالَ عَمَّا قَلِيلٍ لَّيُصْبِحُنَّ نَادِمِينَ,He said ‘In a little while of time ‘ammā the mā is extra they will become remorseful’ about their disbelief and their denial.
فَأَخَذَتْهُمُ ٱلصَّيْحَةُ بِٱلْحَقِّ فَجَعَلْنَاهُمْ غُثَآءً فَبُعْداً لِّلْقَوْمِ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ,So the Cry the Cry of chastisement and destruction seized them rightfully and they died and We made them as husks ghuthā’ is desiccated vegetation in other words We transformed them into similarly desiccated worthless things. So a far removal from mercy for the evildoing folk the denying folk.
ثُمَّ أَنشَأْنَا مِن بَعْدِهِمْ قُرُوناً آخَرِينَ,Then after them We brought forth other generations other peoples.
مَا تَسْبِقُ مِنْ أُمَّةٍ أَجَلَهَا وَمَا يَسْتَأْخِرُونَ,No community can precede its term by dying before it nor be deferred beyond it the person in the second verb yasta’khirūna ‘be deferred’ is masculine having been feminine in the first verb tasbiqu ‘precede’ because this masculine plural takes into account the plural masculine content of the term ‘community’.
ثُمَّ أَرْسَلْنَا رُسُلَنَا تَتْرَا كُلَّ مَا جَآءَ أُمَّةً رَّسُولُهَا كَذَّبُوهُ فَأَتْبَعْنَا بَعْضَهُمْ بَعْضاً وَجَعَلْنَاهُمْ أَحَادِيثَ فَبُعْداً لِّقَوْمٍ لاَّ يُؤْمِنُونَ,Then sent We Our messengers successively read tatran or tatrā one following the other with a long interval between every two. Whenever there came to a community jā’a ummatan read pronouncing both hamzas or without pronouncing the second one between it and the wāw vowel its messenger they denied him; so We made them follow one another to destruction and We turned them into folktales. So away with a people who do not believe!
ثُمَّ أَرْسَلْنَا مُوسَىٰ وَأَخَاهُ هَارُونَ بِآيَاتِنَا وَسُلْطَانٍ مُّبِينٍ,Then We sent Moses and his brother Aaron with Our signs and a manifest warrant a clear proof namely the hand the staff and other signs
إِلَىٰ فِرْعَوْنَ وَمَلَئِهِ فَٱسْتَكْبَرُواْ وَكَانُواْ قَوْماً عَالِينَ,to Pharaoh and his council; but they disdained to believing in them and in God and they were a tyrannical folk subjugating the Children of Israel through oppression.
فَقَالُوۤاْ أَنُؤْمِنُ لِبَشَرَيْنِ مِثْلِنَا وَقَوْمُهُمَا لَنَا عَابِدُونَ,And they said ‘Shall we believe two humans like ourselves while their people are servile to us?’ obedient and submissive.
فَكَذَّبُوهُمَا فَكَانُواْ مِنَ ٱلْمُهْلَكِينَ,So they denied them both and became of those who were destroyed.
وَلَقَدْ آتَيْنَا مُوسَىٰ ٱلْكِتَابَ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَهْتَدُونَ,And verily We gave Moses the Scripture the Torah that perhaps they his people the Children of Israel might be guided thereby from error — he Moses was given it the Scripture after the destruction of Pharaoh and his folk all at once.
وَجَعَلْنَا ٱبْنَ مَرْيَمَ وَأُمَّهُ آيَةً وَآوَيْنَاهُمَآ إِلَىٰ رَبْوَةٍ ذَاتِ قَرَارٍ وَمَعِينٍ,And We made the son of Mary Jesus and his mother a sign — He did not say ‘two signs’ because the same sign is in both of them his being born without his mother’s having a male spouse. And We gave them refuge on a height rabwa a highland — in this case either the Holy House of Jerusalem Damascus or Palestine all of which are alternative opinions — level dhāt qarār an flat high- land on which its inhabitants are able to settle yastaqirru and watered by springs running water over ground which the eyes can see.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلرُّسُلُ كُلُواْ مِنَ ٱلطَّيِّبَاتِ وَٱعْمَلُواْ صَالِحاً إِنِّي بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ عَلِيمٌ,‘O messengers eat of the good things the lawful things and perform righteous acts such as obligatory and supererogatory rituals. Surely I know what you do and will requite you for it.
وَإِنَّ هَـٰذِهِ أُمَّتُكُمْ أُمَّةً وَاحِدَةً وَأَنَاْ رَبُّكُمْ فَٱتَّقُونِ,And know that this creed of Islam is your community your religion O you being addressed that is you must adhere to it as one community — a necessary state of affairs a variant reading for anna ‘that’ has the softened form in; a variant has inna ‘truly’ indicating the beginning of an independent new sentence and I am your Lord so fear Me’ so be fearful of Me.
فَتَقَطَّعُوۤاْ أَمْرَهُمْ بَيْنَهُمْ زُبُراً كُلُّ حِزْبٍ بِمَا لَدَيْهِمْ فَرِحُونَ,But they the followers split into sects regarding their affair their religion zuburan ‘sects’ is a circumstantial qualifier of the subject of the verb taqatta‘ū ‘they split’ in other words they became opposing parties the likes of the Jews and the Christians and others each party rejoicing in exultant with what they had that is with the religion they had.
فَذَرْهُمْ فِي غَمْرَتِهِمْ حَتَّىٰ حِينٍ,So leave them the disbelievers of Mecca in their error their misguidance for a while until they die.
أَيَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّمَا نُمِدُّهُمْ بِهِ مِن مَّالٍ وَبَنِينَ,Do they suppose that in the wealth and children with which We provide them in the life of this world
نُسَارِعُ لَهُمْ فِي ٱلْخَيْرَاتِ بَل لاَّ يَشْعُرُونَ,We are hastening to provide them with good things? No. Rather they are not aware that this is a way of gradually drawing them into their punishment.
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ هُم مِّنْ خَشْيةِ رَبِّهِمْ مُّشْفِقُونَ,Surely those who for fear of their Lord are apprehensive are fearful of His chastisement
وَٱلَّذِينَ هُم بِآيَاتِ رَبَّهِمْ يُؤْمِنُونَ,and who believe in who accept the truth of the signs of their Lord — the Qur’ān;
وَٱلَّذِينَ هُم بِرَبِّهِمْ لاَ يُشْرِكُونَ,and who do not associate others with their Lord
وَٱلَّذِينَ يُؤْتُونَ مَآ آتَواْ وَّقُلُوبُهُمْ وَجِلَةٌ أَنَّهُمْ إِلَىٰ رَبِّهِمْ رَاجِعُونَ,and who give what they give of voluntary alms and righteous deeds while their hearts tremble with awe fearful lest it not be accepted from them because the particle lām ‘for’ is taken as implied before annahum ‘that they’ they are going to return to their Lord —
أُوْلَـٰئِكَ يُسَارِعُونَ فِي ٱلْخَيْرَاتِ وَهُمْ لَهَا سَابِقُونَ,those are the ones who hasten to perform good works and they are the ones who shall come out ahead in them according to God’s knowledge.
وَلاَ نُكَلِّفُ نَفْساً إِلاَّ وُسْعَهَا وَلَدَيْنَا كِتَابٌ يَنطِقُ بِٱلْحَقِّ وَهُمْ لاَ يُظْلَمُونَ,And We do not task any soul beyond its capacity what it can bear — thus he who is not able to pray standing let him pray sitting down and he who is not able to fast let him eat; and with Us is a Record that speaks the truth regarding what it a soul has done — and this Record is the Preserved Tablet al-lawh al-mahfūz wherein deeds are written down; and they namely the souls in their acts will not be wronged in a single thing thereof and so nothing is diminished of the reward for good deeds nor is anything extra added to the evil deeds.
بَلْ قُلُوبُهُمْ فِي غَمْرَةٍ مِّنْ هَـٰذَا وَلَهُمْ أَعْمَالٌ مِّن دُونِ ذٰلِكَ هُمْ لَهَا عَامِلُونَ,Nay but their hearts that is the hearts of the disbelievers are in ignorance of this Qur’ān and they have other deeds which they will perpetrate besides the ones mentioned against the believers and they will therefore be chastised for them.
حَتَّىٰ إِذَآ أَخَذْنَا مُتْرَفِيهِمْ بِٱلْعَذَابِ إِذَا هُمْ يَجْأَرُونَ,Indeed hattā is for inceptiveness when We seize their affluent ones their wealthy and their leaders with chastisement with the sword on the day of Badr behold! they are supplicating loudly clamouring in supplication. It is then said to them
لاَ تَجْأَرُواْ ٱلْيَوْمَ إِنَّكُمْ مِّنَّا لاَ تُنصَرُونَ,‘Do not supplicate out loud on this day! Truly you will not receive help you will not be protected against Us.
قَدْ كَانَتْ آيَاتِي تُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْكُمْ فَكُنتُمْ عَلَىٰ أَعْقَابِكُمْ تَنكِصُونَ,Verily My signs in the Qur’ān used to be recited to you but you used to take to your heels falling back in retreat
مُسْتَكْبِرِينَ بِهِ سَامِراً تَهْجُرُونَ,disdainful of embracing faith because of it that is because of the Sacred House or the Meccan Sanctuary and their being inhabitants thereof secure in contrast to the situation with all other peoples in their hometowns while in your night sessions sāmiran is a circumstantial qualifier in other words they come together to converse at night around the Sacred House you talked nonsense’ if read as tahjurūna the third form from hajara means while ‘you disregarded’ the Qur’ān; but if read as the fourth form tuhjirūna from ahjara it means while ‘you speak falsehood’ about the Prophet and the Qur’ān.
أَفَلَمْ يَدَّبَّرُواْ ٱلْقَوْلَ أَمْ جَآءَهُمْ مَّا لَمْ يَأْتِ آبَآءَهُمُ ٱلأَوَّلِينَ,God exalted be He says Have they not contemplated yaddabbarū should actually be yatadabbarū but the tā’ has been assimilated with the dāl the discourse namely the Qur’ān that is proof of the Prophet’s sincerity or has there come upon them that which has not come upon their forefathers?
أَمْ لَمْ يَعْرِفُواْ رَسُولَهُمْ فَهُمْ لَهُ مُنكِرُونَ,Or is it that they do not recognise their own Messenger and so they reject him?
أَمْ يَقُولُونَ بِهِ جِنَّةٌ بَلْ جَآءَهُمْ بِٱلْحَقِّ وَأَكْثَرُهُمْ لِلْحَقِّ كَارِهُونَ,Or do they say ‘There is a madness in him’? — this interrogative is meant as an affirmation of the truth of the Prophet’s sincerity and of the fact that messengers did come to past communities and of the fact that they do indeed recognise their Messenger to be truthful and trustworthy and of the fact that there is no madness in him. Nay bal is for transition he has brought them the truth namely the Qur’ān that comprises affirmations of the Oneness of God and the Laws of Islam; but most of them are averse to the truth.
وَلَوِ ٱتَّبَعَ ٱلْحَقُّ أَهْوَآءَهُمْ لَفَسَدَتِ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتُ وَٱلأَرْضُ وَمَن فِيهِنَّ بَلْ أَتَيْنَاهُمْ بِذِكْرِهِمْ فَهُمْ عَن ذِكْرِهِمْ مُّعْرِضُونَ,And if the truth namely the Qur’ān had followed their desires and come to them with mention of what they fancied in the way of God having a partner and a child may God be exalted above such associations indeed the heavens and the earth and whoever is in them would have been corrupted they the heavens and the earth would have deviated from their observed order because contradictions would ensue as is usually the case when there is more than one ruler. Nay We have brought them their Remembrance namely the Qur’ān in which they are remembered and honoured but they are disregardful of their own Remembrance.
أَمْ تَسْأَلُهُمْ خَرْجاً فَخَرَاجُ رَبِّكَ خَيْرٌ وَهُوَ خَيْرُ ٱلرَّازِقِينَ,Or do you ask them for any recompense? any remuneration in return for the faith that you have brought them? Yet the recompense of your Lord is His remuneration His reward and His provision are better one reading has kharjan ‘recompense’ in both instances sc. kharjan fa-kharju; another has kharājan in both sc. kharājan fa-kharāju and He is the best of providers the best of givers and remunerators.
وَإِنَّكَ لَتَدْعُوهُمْ إِلَىٰ صِرَاطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ,And truly you summon them to a straight path a straight route that is the religion of Islam.
وَإِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱلآخِرَةِ عَنِ ٱلصِّرَاطِ لَنَاكِبُونَ,And truly those who do not believe in the Hereafter in resurrection reward and punishment deviate swerve away from the path that is the route to salvation.
وَلَوْ رَحِمْنَاهُمْ وَكَشَفْنَا مَا بِهِمْ مِّن ضُرٍّ لَّلَجُّواْ فِي طُغْيَانِهِمْ يَعْمَهُونَ,And had We shown them mercy and relieved them of the harm afflicting them — the famine that befell them in Mecca for seven years — they would surely persist in their insolence in their error bewildered hesitating.
وَلَقَدْ أَخَذْنَاهُمْ بِٱلْعَذَابِ فَمَا ٱسْتَكَانُواْ لِرَبِّهِمْ وَمَا يَتَضَرَّعُونَ,And We have already seized them with chastisement with hunger yet they did not humble themselves to their Lord nor did they devote themselves to prayer nor did they seek the pleasure of God through supplication.
حَتَّىٰ إِذَا فَتَحْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ بَاباً ذَا عَذَابٍ شَدِيدٍ إِذَا هُمْ فِيهِ مُبْلِسُونَ,Until hattā is for inceptiveness when We opened on them the gate of a severe chastisement namely the day of Badr slaying them behold! they are aghast thereat despairing of anything good.
وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِيۤ أَنْشَأَ لَكُمُ ٱلسَّمْعَ وَٱلأَبْصَارَ وَٱلأَفْئِدَةَ قَلِيلاً مَّا تَشْكُرُونَ,And He it is Who made created for you hearing meaning ears and eyes and hearts. Little thanks do you show qalīlan mā mā emphasises the paucity of the thanks.
وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِي ذَرَأَكُمْ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَإِلَيْهِ تُحْشَرُونَ,And He it is Who dispersed created you on earth and to Him you shall be gathered resurrected.
وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِي يُحْيِي وَيُمِيتُ وَلَهُ ٱخْتِلاَفُ ٱللَّيْلِ وَٱلنَّهَارِ أَفَلاَ تَعْقِلُونَ,And He it is Who gives life by breathing the Spirit into the embryo mudgha and brings death and due to Him is the alternation of night and day in darkness and brightness and through increase and diminution. Will you not then comprehend? His handiwork exalted be He and so reflect?
بَلْ قَالُواْ مِثْلَ مَا قَالَ ٱلأَوَّلُونَ,Nay but they say the like of what the ancients said.
قَالُوۤاْ أَإِذَا مِتْنَا وَكُنَّا تُرَاباً وَعِظَاماً أَإِنَّا لَمَبْعُوثُونَ,They the ancients said ‘What when we are dead and have become dust and bones shall we then be raised? No! the two hamzas in each of the two instances are either pronounced fully or with the second one not pronounced but with an alif inserted between the two hamzas in both readings.
لَقَدْ وُعِدْنَا نَحْنُ وَآبَآؤُنَا هَـٰذَا مِن قَبْلُ إِنْ هَـٰذَآ إِلاَّ أَسَاطِيرُ ٱلأَوَّلِينَ,Already We and our fathers have been promised this resurrection after death before these are nothing but the fables the lies of the ancients’ mere jokes and strange tales asātīr the plural of ustūra.
قُل لِّمَنِ ٱلأَرْضُ وَمَن فِيهَآ إِن كُنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ,Say to them ‘To whom does the earth and whoever is in it of creatures belong if you truly knew?’ their Creator and Owner.
سَيَقُولُونَ لِلَّهِ قُلْ أَفَلاَ تَذَكَّرُونَ,They will say ‘To God’. Say to them ‘Will you not then remember?’ tadhakkarūna the second tā’ of tatadhakkarūna has been assimilated with the dhāl will you not then be admonished and so realise that the One Who has the power to originate creation also has the power to resurrect after death?
قُلْ مَن رَّبُّ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ ٱلسَّبْعِ وَرَبُّ ٱلْعَرْشِ ٱلْعَظِيمِ,Say ‘Who is the Lord of the seven heavens and the Lord of the Great Throne?’ that is the throne kursī.
سَيَقُولُونَ لِلَّهِ قُلْ أَفَلاَ تَتَّقُونَ,They will say ‘God’. Say ‘Will you not then be God-fearing?’ will you then not be wary of worshipping things other than Him?
قُلْ مَن بِيَدِهِ مَلَكُوتُ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ وَهُوَ يُجْيِرُ وَلاَ يُجَارُ عَلَيْهِ إِن كُنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ,Say ‘In whose hand is the dominion the possession of all things the final tā’ in malakūt is hyperbolic and who protects while from Him there is no protection if you know?’
سَيَقُولُونَ لِلَّهِ قُلْ فَأَنَّىٰ تُسْحَرُونَ,They will say ‘God.’ a variant reading for Allāh ‘God’ in both instances verses 87 and 89 has li’Llāh ‘to God’ which is in keeping with the sense of ‘to whom belongs what has been mentioned?’. Say ‘How then are you bewitched?’ how then are you duped and turned away from the truth the worship of God alone in other words ‘How do you envisage all this to be invalid?’.
بَلْ أَتَيْنَاهُمْ بِٱلْحَقِّ وَإِنَّهُمْ لَكَاذِبُونَ,Nay but We have brought them the truth veracity and they are indeed liars in rejecting it namely the truth of the following
مَا ٱتَّخَذَ ٱللَّهُ مِن وَلَدٍ وَمَا كَانَ مَعَهُ مِنْ إِلَـهٍ إِذاً لَّذَهَبَ كُلُّ إِلَـٰهٍ بِمَا خَلَقَ وَلَعَلاَ بَعْضُهُمْ عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ سُبْحَانَ ٱللَّهِ عَمَّا يَصِفُونَ,God has not taken any son nor is there any god along with Him; for then that is if there were a god along with Him each god would have taken away what he created he would have made it exclusively his and prevented the other god from having any mastery over it; and some of them would surely rise up against others in challenge just as the kings of this world are wont to do. Glorified be God — an exaltation of Him — above what they ascribe to Him of what has been mentioned.
عَالِمِ ٱلْغَيْبِ وَٱلشَّهَادَةِ فَتَعَالَىٰ عَمَّا يُشْرِكُونَ,Knower of the Unseen and the visible what is hidden and what is observed if read in the genitive ‘ālimi’l-ghaybi ‘Knower of the Unseen’ this is an adjectival qualification; if in the nominative ‘ālimu’l-ghaybi ‘the Knower of the Unseen this would be the predicate of an implied preceding huwa ‘He is’ and exalted magnified be He above what they associate! with Him of partners.
قُل رَّبِّ إِمَّا تُرِيَنِّي مَا يُوعَدُونَ,Say ‘My Lord! If immā this contains an assimilation of the conditional particle in with the extra mā You should show me what they are promised in the way of chastisement that it is true by their being slain at Badr
رَبِّ فَلاَ تَجْعَلْنِي فِي ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ,my Lord then do no put me among the evildoing folk’ lest I be destroyed when they are destroyed.
وَإِنَّا عَلَىٰ أَن نُّرِيَكَ مَا نَعِدُهُمْ لَقَادِرُونَ,And truly We are able to show you what We promise them.
ٱدْفَعْ بِٱلَّتِي هِيَ أَحْسَنُ ٱلسَّيِّئَةَ نَحْنُ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا يَصِفُونَ,Ward off with that which is better that is to say with the better trait of pardoning and shunning them the evil act the hurt they cause you — this was revealed before the command to fight them. We know best what they allege what they invent of lies and what they say and so We will requite them for it.
وَقُلْ رَّبِّ أَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنْ هَمَزَاتِ ٱلشَّياطِينِ,And say ‘My Lord I seek protection in You from the promptings of devils from their evil suggestions which they whisper.
وَأَعُوذُ بِكَ رَبِّ أَن يَحْضُرُونِ,And I seek protection in You my Lord lest they visit me’ in any of my affairs for they only visit to bring ill.
حَتَّىٰ إِذَا جَآءَ أَحَدَهُمُ ٱلْمَوْتُ قَالَ رَبِّ ٱرْجِعُونِ,Until hattā is for inceptiveness when death comes to one of them and he sees his place in the Fire and his would-be place in Paradise had he been a believer he says ‘My Lord! Send me back arji‘ūn the plural person is used to indicate the gravity of the plea
لَعَلِّيۤ أَعْمَلُ صَالِحاً فِيمَا تَرَكْتُ كَلاَّ إِنَّهَا كَلِمَةٌ هُوَ قَآئِلُهَا وَمِن وَرَآئِهِمْ بَرْزَخٌ إِلَىٰ يَوْمِ يُبْعَثُونَ,that I might act righteously by witnessing that ‘there is no god but God’ that this might be in that which I have left behind’ in what I have wasted of my life in other words that this affirmation might be in its place. God exalted be He says By no means! that is there shall be no return. It namely the statement ‘My Lord! Send me back’ is merely a word that he speaks but a word in which there is no benefit for him; and behind them ahead of them there is a barrier which prevents them from going back to this world until the day when they are raised after which day there will be no more return.
فَإِذَا نُفِخَ فِي ٱلصُّورِ فَلاَ أَنسَابَ بَيْنَهُمْ يَوْمَئِذٍ وَلاَ يَتَسَآءَلُونَ,And when the Trumpet is blown the Horn at the first or second blast there will be no more ties of kinship between them on that day for them to boast of among themselves nor will they question one another about such ties in contrast to their state in the life of this world because of the gravity of the situation that will distract them from such questioning at certain points during the Day of Resurrection. At other points they are awake and as is stated in one verse Some of them will turn to others questioning each other Q. 3750.
فَمَن ثَقُلَتْ مَوَازِينُهُ فَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْمُفْلِحُونَ,Then those whose scales are heavy with good deeds they are the successful the winners;
وَمَنْ خَفَّتْ مَوَازِينُهُ فأُوْلَـٰئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ خَسِرُوۤاْ أَنفُسَهُمْ فِي جَهَنَّمَ خَالِدُونَ,and those whose scales are light because of evil deeds they are the ones who have lost their souls and so they will be abiding in Hell.
تَلْفَحُ وُجُوهَهُمُ ٱلنَّارُ وَهُمْ فِيهَا كَالِحُونَ,The Fire will scorch their faces it will burn them while they glower therein their upper and lower lips having receded from their teeth and it will be said to them
أَلَمْ تَكُنْ آيَاتِي تُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْكُمْ فَكُنْتُمْ بِهَا تُكَذِّبُونَ,‘Were not My signs in the Qur’ān recited to you were you not threatened therewith and you used to deny them?’
قَالُواْ رَبَّنَا غَلَبَتْ عَلَيْنَا شِقْوَتُنَا وَكُنَّا قَوْماً ضَآلِّينَ,They will say ‘Our Lord our wretchedness shiqwatunā a variant reading has shaqāwatunā both of which are verbal nouns with the same meaning overcame us and we were an erring folk astray from guidance.
رَبَّنَآ أَخْرِجْنَا مِنْهَا فَإِنْ عُدْنَا فَإِنَّا ظَالِمُونَ,Our Lord bring us out of it! Then if we revert to disobedience we will indeed be evildoers’.
قَالَ ٱخْسَئُواْ فِيهَا وَلاَ تُكَلِّمُونِ,He will say to them by the tongue of a Keeper of Hell whose proportion is twice the size of this world ‘Begone in it away with you in the Fire despicable as you are and do not speak to Me about relieving you from the chastisement — so that all their hope is extinguished.
إِنَّهُ كَانَ فَرِيقٌ مِّنْ عِبَادِي يَقُولُونَ رَبَّنَآ آمَنَّا فَٱغْفِرْ لَنَا وَٱرْحَمْنَا وَأَنتَ خَيْرُ ٱلرَّاحِمِينَ,Indeed there was a party of My servants — namely the Emigrants — who would say “Our Lord we believe; therefore forgive us and have mercy on us for You are the best of the merciful”.
فَٱتَّخَذْتُمُوهُمْ سِخْرِيّاً حَتَّىٰ أَنسَوْكُمْ ذِكْرِي وَكُنْتُمْ مِّنْهُمْ تَضْحَكُونَ,But then you took them as an object of ridicule read sukhriyyan or sikhriyyan a verbal noun meaning ‘mockery’. Among those ridiculed were Bilāl al-Habashī Suhayb al-Rūmī ‘Ammār b. Yāsir and Salmān al-Fārisī; until they made you forget My remembrance which you disregarded as you were engaged in deriding them. Thus these men were the cause of the forgetting which is why this act has been attributed to them and you used to laugh at them.
إِنِّي جَزَيْتُهُمُ ٱلْيَوْمَ بِمَا صَبَرُوۤاْ أَنَّهُمْ هُمُ ٱلْفَآئِزُونَ,Indeed I have rewarded them this day abiding bliss for the endurance they showed while you mocked them and caused them hurt. They are indeed the winners’ of what they sought read innahum as indicating a new sentence or annahum as indicating a second direct object of the verb jazaytuhum ‘I have rewarded them’.
قَالَ كَمْ لَبِثْتُمْ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ عَدَدَ سِنِينَ,He exalted be He will say to them by the tongue of a Keeper of Hell a variant reading for qāla ‘He will say’ has qul ‘say’ ‘How long did you tarry in the earth in this world and in your graves in years?’ ‘adada sinīna is a specification.
قَالُواْ لَبِثْنَا يَوْماً أَوْ بَعْضَ يَوْمٍ فَسْئَلِ ٱلْعَآدِّينَ,They will say ‘We tarried a day or part of a day — they are uncertain thereof deeming it shorter than what it was because of the gravity of the chastisement they are suffering. Yet ask those who keep count!’ namely ask the angels who number the deeds of all creatures.
قَالَ إِن لَّبِثْتُمْ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً لَّوْ أَنَّكُمْ كُنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ,He exalted will say to them also by the tongue of Keeper of Hell a variant reading for qāla ‘He will say’ has qul ‘say’ ‘You tarried but a little if only you knew the length of time you tarried you would have realised that it is trivial relative to how long you will tarry in the Fire.
أَفَحَسِبْتُمْ أَنَّمَا خَلَقْنَاكُمْ عَبَثاً وَأَنَّكُمْ إِلَيْنَا لاَ تُرْجَعُونَ,Did you suppose that We created you aimlessly and not for an underlying reason and that you would not be returned to Us?’ read active tarji‘ūna ‘you would not return’ or passive turja‘ūna ‘you would not be returned’ Nay! But it was so that We might enthral you with commands and prohibitions where after you would be returned to Us for Us to requite you accordingly And I did not create the jinn and mankind except that they may worship Me Q. 5156.
فَتَعَالَى ٱللَّهُ ٱلْمَلِكُ ٱلْحَقُّ لاَ إِلَـٰهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ رَبُّ ٱلْعَرْشِ ٱلْكَرِيمِ,So exalted be God above aimless action and other such things that do not befit Him the King the Truth! There is no god except Him the Lord of the Noble Throne ‘arsh the throne kursī which is a seat similar to a king’s that is exquisite.
وَمَن يَدْعُ مَعَ ٱللَّهِ إِلَـهَا آخَرَ لاَ بُرْهَانَ لَهُ بِهِ فَإِنَّمَا حِسَابُهُ عِندَ رَبِّهِ إِنَّهُ لاَ يُفْلِحُ ٱلْكَافِرُونَ,And he who calls on another god along with God has no proof thereof lā burhāna lahu bihi an extra explicative adjectival qualification that has no other syntactical signification his reckoning his requital will indeed be with his Lord. Truly the disbelievers will not be successful they will not be felicitous.
وَقُل رَّبِّ ٱغْفِرْ وَٱرْحَمْ وَأنتَ خَيْرُ ٱلرَّاحِمِينَ,And say ‘My Lord forgive and have mercy on believers — this ‘mercy’ adds to the ‘forgiveness’ in terms of God’s grace — and You are the best of the merciful’ the most excellent of those who have mercy.
سُورَةٌ أَنزَلْنَاهَا وَفَرَضْنَاهَا وَأَنزَلْنَا فِيهَآ آيَاتٍ بَيِّنَاتٍ لَّعَلَّكُمْ تَذَكَّرُونَ,This is a sūra which We have revealed and prescribed read faradnāhā or the intensive form farradnāhā on account of the large number of prescriptions contained in it and wherein We have revealed manifest signs signs containing clear indications that perhaps you might remember tadhakkarūna the second tā’ of tatadhakkarūna has been assimilated with the dhāl that you might be admonished.
ٱلزَّانِيَةُ وَٱلزَّانِي فَٱجْلِدُواْ كُلَّ وَاحِدٍ مِّنْهُمَا مِئَةَ جَلْدَةٍ وَلاَ تَأْخُذْكُمْ بِهِمَا رَأْفَةٌ فِي دِينِ ٱللَّهِ إِن كُنتُمْ تُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلآخِرِ وَلْيَشْهَدْ عَذَابَهُمَا طَآئِفَةٌ مِّنَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,As for the fornicatress and the fornicator that is of those not in wedlock — because those in wedlock are stoned according to the Sunna the al in al-zāniya ‘the fornicatress’ and al-zānī ‘the fornicator’ according to some mentioned opinions is a relative particle; the clause al-zāniyatu wa’l-zānī is a subject and because of its similarity to a conditional the fā’ has been inserted into the predicate which is the following fa’jlidū strike each of them a hundred lashes a hundred strikes one says jaladahu to mean daraba jildahu ‘he struck him on the skin’. According to the Sunna in addition to this punishment there is also banishment for a whole year. The slave however receives half of the mentioned punishment. And do not let any pity for them overcome you in God’s religion that is to say in the fulfilment of His rulings by disregarding any part of their prescribed punishment if you believe in God and the Last Day namely the Day of Resurrection in this statement there is an incitement to abide by what was mentioned before the conditional above and it also constitutes the response to the latter or at least is an indication of the response to it. And let their punishment the flogging be witnessed by a group of the believers — some say that this should be a group of three; some say four as in the number of witnesses testifying to an act of fornication.
ٱلزَّانِي لاَ يَنكِحُ إِلاَّ زَانِيَةً أَوْ مُشْرِكَةً وَٱلزَّانِيَةُ لاَ يَنكِحُهَآ إِلاَّ زَانٍ أَوْ مُشْرِكٌ وَحُرِّمَ ذٰلِكَ عَلَى ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,The fornicator shall not marry anyone but a fornicatress or an idolatress and the fornicatress shall be married by none except a fornicator or an idolator in other words what is suitable for each of the two for the purposes of marriage is the above-mentioned; and that namely marrying of fornicators is forbidden to believers who are better than those. This was revealed when the poor among the Emigrants resolved to marry the wealthy whores of the idolaters so that they the women would provide for them. Thus it is said that the prohibition applies specifically to them; but it is also said to apply in general; but it was abrogated by God’s words Marry off the spouseless among you Q. 2432.
وَٱلَّذِينَ يَرْمُونَ ٱلْمُحْصَنَاتِ ثُمَّ لَمْ يَأْتُواْ بِأَرْبَعَةِ شُهَدَآءَ فَٱجْلِدُوهُمْ ثَمَانِينَ جَلْدَةً وَلاَ تَقْبَلُواْ لَهُمْ شَهَادَةً أَبَداً وَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْفَاسِقُونَ,And those who accuse honourable women in wedlock who are chaste of fornication and then do not bring four witnesses to testify as eyewitnesses to their fornication strike them eighty lashes that is each one of them and do not accept any testimony from them ever in anything; and those they are the immoral for committing a grave sin kabīra;
إِلاَّ ٱلَّذِينَ تَابُواْ مِن بَعْدِ ذٰلِكَ وَأَصْلَحُواْ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,except those who repent thereafter and make amends in their deeds for God is indeed Forgiving of their unsubstantiated accusations Merciful to them in inspiring them to make repentance whereby their immorality is curbed and their testimony becomes once again acceptable — some say however that it can never be accepted thereafter if the proviso is taken to refer to the last clause.
وَٱلَّذِينَ يَرْمُونَ أَزْوَاجَهُمْ وَلَمْ يَكُنْ لَّهُمْ شُهَدَآءُ إِلاَّ أَنفُسُهُمْ فَشَهَادَةُ أَحَدِهِمْ أَرْبَعُ شَهَادَاتٍ بِٱللَّهِ إِنَّهُ لَمِنَ ٱلصَّادِقِينَ,And those who accuse their wives of fornication but have no witnesses to substantiate this except themselves — which happened with some Companions — then the testimony of one of them fa-shahādatu ahadihim the subject shall be to testify swearing by God four times araba‘a shahādātin is in the accusative as a verbal noun that he is indeed being truthful in accusing his wife of committing fornication
وَٱلْخَامِسَةُ أَنَّ لَعْنَتَ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْهِ إِن كَانَ مِنَ ٱلْكَاذِبِينَ,and a fifth time that God’s wrath shall be upon him if he were lying in this the predicate of the subject fa-shahādatu ahadihim ‘then the testimony of one of them’ is the implicit ‘will spare him the prescribed legal punishment for false accusation’.
وَيَدْرَؤُاْ عَنْهَا ٱلْعَذَابَ أَن تَشْهَدَ أَرْبَعَ شَهَادَاتٍ بِٱللَّهِ إِنَّهُ لَمِنَ ٱلْكَاذِبِينَ,And the punishment namely the prescribed legal punishment for fornication that is established upon his testimony shall be averted from her if she testify swearing by God four times that he is indeed lying in accusing her of having fornicated;
وَٱلْخَامِسَةَ أَنَّ غَضَبَ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْهَآ إِن كَانَ مِنَ ٱلصَّادِقِينَ,and a fifth time that God’s wrath shall be upon her if he were being truthful therein.
وَلَوْلاَ فَضْلُ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ وَرَحْمَتُهُ وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ تَوَّابٌ حَكِيمٌ,And were it not for God’s bounty to you and His mercy in shielding you from being exposed in such situations and that God is the Relenting in His acceptance of repentance in such situations and otherwise Wise in the rulings He has given for this and other matters that He might make clear the truth therein and hasten punishment for those deserving it.
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ جَآءُوا بِٱلإِفْكِ عُصْبَةٌ مِّنْكُمْ لاَ تَحْسَبُوهُ شَرّاً لَّكُمْ بَلْ هُوَ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ لِكُلِّ ٱمْرِىءٍ مِّنْهُمْ مَّا ٱكْتَسَبَ مِنَ ٱلإِثْمِ وَٱلَّذِي تَوَلَّىٰ كِبْرَهُ مِنْهُمْ لَهُ عَذَابٌ عَظِيمٌ,Truly those who initiated the slander the worst calumny against ‘Ā’isha — mother of the believers may God be pleased with her — accusing her of fornication are a band from among yourselves a group from among the believers. She said that these were Hassān b. Thābit ‘Abd Allāh b. Ubayy Mistah b. Uthātha and Hamna bt. Jahsh. Do not suppose O you believers other than the mentioned band that it is bad for you; rather it is good for you for God will reward you for it and reveal ‘Ā’isha’s innocence and the innocence of the one who is supposed to have committed it with her namely Safwān b. al-Mu‘attal. She ‘Ā’isha related ‘I accompanied the Prophet s during a raid and this was after the requirement to wear the veil had been revealed. When he was through with it the raid he headed back to the campsite and one night having drawn close to Medina he announced that all should march off home. So I walked a distance away from the campsite and relieved myself. But when I came back to the campsite I realised that my necklace ‘iqd meaning qilāda had snapped. So I went back to look for it. In the meantime they had strapped my litter’ — in which one rides — ‘thinking that I was inside for in those days women were slight and ate very small portions ‘ulqa. Finally I found my necklace but when I went back to where I had been staying overnight they had already departed. I sat in the place where I had camped; I assumed that the group would notice my absence and come back for me. But my eyes were overcome by drowsiness and I fell asleep. Safwān had pitched camp behind the army to rest for some of the night ‘arrasa then set off while it was still night until he reached the site of the camp. He saw what looked like a person sleeping and recognised me when he eventually saw me having seen me on numerous occasions before the requirement of the veil. I woke up to the sound of him saying ‘To God we belong and to Him we shall surely return’ innā li’Llāhi wa-innā ilayhi rāji‘ūn for he had recognised me. So I concealed my face with my gown jilbāb — in other words I covered it up with my wrap mulā’a.
لَّوْلاۤ إِذْ سَمِعْتُمُوهُ ظَنَّ ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ وَٱلْمُؤْمِنَاتُ بِأَنْفُسِهِمْ خَيْراً وَقَالُواْ هَـٰذَآ إِفْكٌ مُّبِينٌ,Why when you first heard about it did the believing men and women not think good of themselves that is why did some not think good of others and say ‘This is a manifest calumny?’ this is a patent lie? there is a shift here in the address from the second to the third person in other words why did you not assume good of them O band of believers and say
لَّوْلاَ جَآءُوا عَلَيْهِ بِأَرْبَعَةِ شُهَدَآءَ فَإِذْ لَمْ يَأْتُواْ بِالشُّهَدَآءِ فَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ هُمُ ٱلْكَاذِبُونَ,Why did they that is this band of accusers not produce four witnesses to it? who had witnessed it. And since they did not produce the witnesses those in God’s sight in His judgement they are liars in this matter.
وَلَوْلاَ فَضْلُ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ وَرَحْمَتُهُ فِي ٱلدُّنْيَا وَٱلآخِرَةِ لَمَسَّكُمْ فِي مَآ أَفَضْتُمْ فِيهِ عَذَابٌ عَظِيمٌ,And were it not for God’s bounty to you and His mercy in the life of this world and the Hereafter there would have befallen you for what you O band of accusers engaged in for what you indulged in an awful chastisement in the Hereafter;
إِذْ تَلَقَّوْنَهُ بِأَلْسِنَتِكُمْ وَتَقُولُونَ بِأَفْوَاهِكُمْ مَّا لَّيْسَ لَكُمْ بِهِ عِلْمٌ وَتَحْسَبُونَهُ هَيِّناً وَهُوَ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ عَظِيمٌ,when you were receiving it welcomingly with your tongues that is to say when you were reporting it one from the other one of the two letters tā’ has been omitted from the verb tatalaqqawnahu ‘you were receiving it’; idh ‘when’ is dependent because of massakum ‘befallen you’ or afadtum ‘engaged in’ and were uttering with your mouths that whereof you had no knowledge supposing it to be a light matter a sinless act while with God it was grave in sinfulness.
وَلَوْلاۤ إِذْ سَمِعْتُمُوهُ قُلْتُمْ مَّا يَكُونُ لَنَآ أَن نَّتَكَلَّمَ بِهَـٰذَا سُبْحَانَكَ هَـٰذَا بُهْتَانٌ عَظِيمٌ,And why when you heard it did you not say ‘It is not for us to speak about this. Glory be to You! — this exclamation here is meant to indicate amazement — This is an awful calumny?’ an awful lie?
يَعِظُكُمُ ٱللَّهُ أَن تَعُودُواْ لِمِثْلِهِ أَبَداً إِن كُنتُمْ مُّؤْمِنِينَ,God admonishes you He forbids you lest you should ever repeat the like of it if you are in truth believers then you will be admonished by this.
وَيُبَيِّنُ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمُ ٱلآيَاتِ وَٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ حَكِيمٌ,And God clarifies for you the signs through commands and prohibitions and God is Knower of what He enjoins and what He prohibits Wise therein.
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يُحِبُّونَ أَن تَشِيعَ ٱلْفَاحِشَةُ فِي ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ فِي ٱلدُّنْيَا وَٱلآخِرَةِ وَٱللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ وَأَنْتُمْ لاَ تَعْلَمُونَ,Truly those who love that indecency should be spread by the tongue concerning those who believe by its being associated with them — and the ones meant are the band — theirs will be a painful chastisement in the life of this world by way of the prescribed legal punishment for false accusation and the Hereafter by way of the Fire as is God’s due and God knows that such indecency does not apply in their case and you O band of accusers as regards the calumny of which you spoke do not know whether such indecency took place among them.
وَلَوْلاَ فَضْلُ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ وَرَحْمَتُهُ وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ رَءُوفٌ رَّحِيمٌ,And were it not for God’s bounty to you O band of accusers and His mercy and that God is Gentle Merciful to you He would have surely hastened to bring about your punishment.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ لاَ تَتَّبِعُواْ خُطُوَاتِ ٱلشَّيْطَانِ وَمَن يَتَّبِعْ خُطُوَاتِ ٱلشَّيْطَانِ فَإِنَّهُ يَأْمُرُ بِٱلْفَحْشَآءِ وَٱلْمُنْكَرِ وَلَوْلاَ فَضْلُ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ وَرَحْمَتُهُ مَا زَكَىٰ مِنكُمْ مِّنْ أَحَدٍ أَبَداً وَلَـٰكِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُزَكِّي مَن يَشَآءُ وَٱللَّهُ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ,O you who believe do not follow in the steps of Satan that is his ways of making things seem attractive. For whoever follows in the steps of Satan assuredly he the one being followed enjoins indecency that is he enjoins vile acts and what is reprehensible if followed according to the Law. And were it not for God’s bounty to you and His mercy not one of you O band of accusers would ever have grown pure after the calumny of which you spoke that is to say not one of you would have ever been reformed or purified from this sin by repenting of it. But God purifies whom He will from sin by accepting his repentance from him and God is Hearer of what you have said Knower of your intentions.
وَلاَ يَأْتَلِ أُوْلُواْ ٱلْفَضْلِ مِنكُمْ وَٱلسَّعَةِ أَن يُؤْتُوۤاْ أُوْلِي ٱلْقُرْبَىٰ وَٱلْمَسَاكِينَ وَٱلْمُهَاجِرِينَ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ وَلْيَعْفُواْ وَلْيَصْفَحُوۤاْ أَلاَ تُحِبُّونَ أَن يَغْفِرَ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,And do not let those of you who possess bounty the wealthy and the affluent swear not to give to the near of kin and the poor and those who emigrate in the way of God — this was revealed regarding Abū Bakr who swore to provide no more for Mistah his maternal cousin a destitute Emigrant who had fought at the battle of Badr because of his involvement in the calumny when thitherto he had provided for him. And it was revealed also regarding certain Companions who swore not to give voluntary alms to those who had participated in spreading the calumny in any way. Let them forgive and excuse them in this matter. Do you not love that God should forgive you? And God is Forgiving Merciful to believers. Abū Bakr said ‘Indeed. I would love that God forgive me’ and he restored thereafter to Mistah what he used to expend on him.
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يَرْمُونَ ٱلْمُحْصَنَاتِ ٱلْغَافِلاَتِ ٱلْمُؤْمِناتِ لُعِنُواْ فِي ٱلدُّنْيَا وَٱلآخِرَةِ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ عَظِيمٌ,Truly those who make accusations of fornication against honourably married chaste women who are unaware of indecent acts — since it would never occur to them to commit such acts — who believe in God and His Messenger shall be cursed in this world and the Hereafter; and there will be an awful chastisement for them
يَوْمَ تَشْهَدُ عَلَيْهِمْ أَلْسِنَتُهُمْ وَأَيْدِيهِمْ وَأَرْجُلُهُمْ بِمَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ,on the day yawma is in the accusative because of the implicit sense of ‘permanence’ to which lahum ‘for them’ is semantically connected when their tongues and their hands and their feet shall testify against them read feminine person tashhadu or masculine person yashhadu ‘testify’ concerning what they used to do in terms of speech and action — this day is the Day of Resurrection.
يَوْمَئِذٍ يُوَفِّيهِمُ ٱللَّهُ دِينَهُمُ ٱلْحَقَّ وَيَعْلَمُونَ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ هُوَ ٱلْحَقُّ ٱلْمُبِينُ,On that day God will pay them in full their just due He will requite them with the requital they deserve and they shall know that God is the Manifest Truth since He will have realised for them that requital of His whereof they had been in doubt. Among such people is ‘Abd Allāh b. Ubayy. The ‘honourable women’ mentioned above are the Prophet’s s wives regarding whom no repentance has been mentioned as being possible in the case of their being falsely accused; those women regarding whom repentance has been mentioned however at the beginning of the sūra verses 4-5 in the case of their being falsely accused are women other these wives of the Prophet.
ٱلْخَبِيثَاتُ لِلْخَبِيثِينَ وَٱلْخَبِيثُونَ لِلْخَبِيثَاتِ وَٱلطَّيِّبَاتُ لِلطَّيِّبِينَ وَٱلطَّيِّبُونَ لِلْطَّيِّبَاتِ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ مُبَرَّءُونَ مِمَّا يَقُولُونَ لَهُم مَّغْفِرَةٌ وَرِزْقٌ كَرِيمٌ,Vile women and vile words are for vile men and vile men for vile women and the mentioned vile words. Good women and as mentioned good words are for good men and good men for good women and the mentioned good words that is to say what suits something vile is its like and what suits something good is its like — such good men and women the like of ‘Ā’isha and Safwān are absolved of what they say what the corrupt men and women say about them. For them for good men and women will be forgiveness and a glorious provision in Paradise. ‘Ā’isha felt honoured by some of the things mentioned in this verse namely that she was created ‘a good woman’ and was promised ‘forgiveness and a glorious provision’.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ لاَ تَدْخُلُواْ بُيُوتاً غَيْرَ بُيُوتِكُمْ حَتَّىٰ تَسْتَأْنِسُواْ وَتُسَلِّمُواْ عَلَىٰ أَهْلِهَا ذٰلِكُمْ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَذَكَّرُونَ,O you who believe do not enter houses other than your houses until you have first asked permission and greeted their occupants. So a person must say ‘Peace be upon you may I enter?’ as is stated in one hadīth. That is better for you than entering without permission that perhaps you might remember tadhakkarūna the second tā’ of tatadhakkarūna has been assimilated with the dhāl the superiority of such conduct and so follow it.
فَإِن لَّمْ تَجِدُواْ فِيهَآ أَحَداً فَلاَ تَدْخُلُوهَا حَتَّىٰ يُؤْذَنَ لَكُمْ وَإِن قِيلَ لَكُمْ ٱرْجِعُواْ فَٱرْجِعُواْ هُوَ أَزْكَىٰ لَكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ عَلِيمٌ,And if you do not find anyone in them to give you permission still do not enter them until permission has been given to you. And if it is said to you when you are seeking permission ‘Go away’ then go away for this going away is purer that is better for you than sitting and waiting at the doorstep. And God knows what you do whether you enter with permission or without it and He will requite you for it.
لَّيْسَ عَلَيْكُمْ جُنَاحٌ أَن تَدْخُلُواْ بُيُوتاً غَيْرَ مَسْكُونَةٍ فِيهَا مَتَاعٌ لَّكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ مَا تُبْدُونَ وَمَا تَكْتُمُونَ,You would not be at fault if you enter without permission uninhabited houses wherein is comfort some benefit for you in the way of finding shelter and so on as in the case of travellers inns and charitable hostels. And God knows what you disclose what you do openly and what you hide what you do secretly when entering houses other than your own be it for a righteous purpose or otherwise. It will be mentioned shortly that they should bid themselves peace when entering their own houses.
قُلْ لِّلْمُؤْمِنِينَ يَغُضُّواْ مِنْ أَبْصَارِهِمْ وَيَحْفَظُواْ فُرُوجَهُمْ ذٰلِكَ أَزْكَىٰ لَهُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ خَبِيرٌ بِمَا يَصْنَعُونَ,Tell believing men to lower their gaze from what is unlawful for them to look at min of min absārihim ‘their gaze’ is extra and to guard their private parts from doing with them what is unlawful for them to do. That is purer in other words better for them. Truly God is Aware of what they do with their gazes and private parts and He will requite them for it.
وَقُل لِّلْمُؤْمِنَاتِ يَغْضُضْنَ مِنْ أَبْصَارِهِنَّ وَيَحْفَظْنَ فُرُوجَهُنَّ وَلاَ يُبْدِينَ زِينَتَهُنَّ إِلاَّ مَا ظَهَرَ مِنْهَا وَلْيَضْرِبْنَ بِخُمُرِهِنَّ عَلَىٰ جُيُوبِهِنَّ وَلاَ يُبْدِينَ زِينَتَهُنَّ إِلاَّ لِبُعُولَتِهِنَّ أَوْ آبَآئِهِنَّ أَوْ آبَآءِ بُعُولَتِهِنَّ أَوْ أَبْنَآئِهِنَّ أَوْ أَبْنَآءِ بُعُولَتِهِنَّ أَوْ إِخْوَانِهِنَّ أَوْ بَنِيۤ إِخْوَانِهِنَّ أَوْ بَنِي أَخَوَاتِهِنَّ أَوْ نِسَآئِهِنَّ أَوْ مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُهُنَّ أَوِ ٱلتَّابِعِينَ غَيْرِ أُوْلِي ٱلإِرْبَةِ مِنَ ٱلرِّجَالِ أَوِ ٱلطِّفْلِ ٱلَّذِينَ لَمْ يَظْهَرُواْ عَلَىٰ عَوْرَاتِ ٱلنِّسَآءِ وَلاَ يَضْرِبْنَ بِأَرْجُلِهِنَّ لِيُعْلَمَ مَا يُخْفِينَ مِن زِينَتِهِنَّ وَتُوبُوۤاْ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ جَمِيعاً أَيُّهَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ,And tell believing women to lower their gaze away from what is not lawful for them to look at and to guard their private parts from what is not lawful for them to do with them and not to display their adornment except for what is apparent namely the face and the hands which may be seen by a stranger when there is no danger of either or both falling into temptation — this being one of two opinions. The second of these is that even this is forbidden because there is a presumption that these parts will cause temptation — and this is the preferred opinion if one must settle this topic with a definitive opinion; and let them draw their veils over their bosoms that is let them cover up their heads necks and chests with veils and not reveal their hidden adornment namely all that is other than the face and the hands except to their husbands bu‘ūl is the plural form of ba‘l ‘male spouse’ or their fathers or their husbands’ fathers or their sons or their husbands’ sons or their brothers or their brothers’ sons or their sisters’ sons or their women or what their right hands own all of whom are permitted to look thereat except for the part from the navel down to the knees which is unlawful for any other than their husbands to see; ‘their women’ however excludes disbelieving women for it is not permitted for Muslim women to reveal themselves to these; ‘what their right hands own’ comprises slaves; or such men who are dependant on what food may be left over not ghayri read as an adjective or read ghayra as an exceptive possessing any sexual desire not those men who are in sexual need of women so for example those whose male member cannot become erect; or children who are not yet aware of women’s private parts in the context of sexual intercourse and so to these they may reveal themselves except for that part from the navel to the knees. And do not let them thump with their feet to make known their hidden ornaments as in a rattling anklet and the like. And rally to God in repentance O believers repenting of the occasions on which you may have looked at what is forbidden to look at of such parts and otherwise so that you might be prosperous so that you might be saved from such sinful acts when your repentance thereof is accepted — in this verse the prevalent address is to males over females.
وَأَنْكِحُواْ ٱلأَيَامَىٰ مِنْكُمْ وَٱلصَّالِحِينَ مِنْ عِبَادِكُمْ وَإِمائِكُمْ إِن يَكُونُواْ فُقَرَآءَ يُغْنِهِمُ ٱللَّهُ مِن فَضْلِهِ وَٱللَّهُ وَاسِعٌ عَلِيمٌ,And marry off the spouseless among you ayāmā is the plural form of ayyim namely a spouseless female whether she be a virgin or one previously married or a spouseless male this stipulation relates to free men and free women and the righteous ones the believers among your male slaves and your female slaves ‘ibād is one plural form of ‘abd. If they the free men are poor God will enrich them through marriage out of His bounty. God is Embracing of the needs of His creatures Knowing of them.
وَلْيَسْتَعْفِفِ ٱلَّذِينَ لاَ يَجِدُونَ نِكَاحاً حَتَّىٰ يُغْنِيَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ مِن فَضْلِهِ وَٱلَّذِينَ يَبْتَغُونَ الْكِتَابَ مِمَّا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُكُمْ فَكَاتِبُوهُمْ إِنْ عَلِمْتُمْ فِيهِمْ خَيْراً وَآتُوهُمْ مِّن مَّالِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلَّذِيۤ آتَاكُمْ وَلاَ تُكْرِهُواْ فَتَيَاتِكُمْ عَلَى ٱلْبِغَآءِ إِنْ أَرَدْنَ تَحَصُّناً لِّتَبْتَغُواْ عَرَضَ ٱلْحَيَاةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَمَن يُكْرِههُنَّ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ مِن بَعْدِ إِكْرَاهِهِنَّ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,And let those who cannot find the means to marry be continent those who do not have the bridal money or the means for financial support needed for marriage let them restrain themselves from fornication until God enriches them until He improves their means out of His bounty and they marry. And those who seek a written contract of emancipation from among those whom your right hand owns of male slaves and female slaves contract with them accordingly if you know in them any good such as trustworthiness and the ability to earn income in order to fulfil the amount stated in the written contract which might be worded for example thus ‘I contract you for the amount of two thousand to be paid over a period of two months at one thousand a month and if you fulfill this you are a free man’ and the other would say ‘I accept’; and give them — this is a command for the slaves’ owners — out of the wealth of God which He has given you in the measure that will help them to fulfill their commitment to you the action of ītā’ ‘giving’ here suggests that some of the amount to which they have committed themselves should be waived. And do not compel your slave-girls your handmaidens to prostitution fornication when they desire to be chaste to abstain therefrom this ‘desire’ is the cause of the act of ‘compulsion’ so that the statement is not properly a conditional that you may seek through such compulsion the transient things of the life of this world — this was revealed regarding ‘Abd Allāh b. Ubayy who used to force his slave-girls to earn money through fornication. And should anyone compel them then surely God after their compulsion will be Forgiving to these slave-girls Merciful to them.
وَلَقَدْ أَنْزَلْنَآ إِلَيْكُمْ آيَاتٍ مُّبَيِّنَاتٍ وَمَثَلاً مِّنَ ٱلَّذِينَ خَلَوْاْ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ وَمَوْعِظَةً لِّلْمُتَّقِينَ,And verily We have revealed to you clear verses read mubayyanāt or mubayyināt in this sūra verses in which if read mubayyanāt what is mentioned is already clear or which if read mubayyināt are clarificatory of that which is mentioned and an example a curious tale namely that of ‘Ā’isha of those who passed away before you that is to say of their kind of example that is an example of their curious tales such as the tales of Joseph and Mary and an admonition for those who fear God in what He exalted be He has said And do not let any pity for them overcome you in God’s religion verse 2 above; and Why when you first heard about it did the believing men and women not think good of themselves… to the end of verse 12 above; and And why when you heard it did you not say … to the end of verse 16 above; and God admonishes you lest you should ever repeat the like of it … to the end of verse 17 above. This admonition is specifically for ‘those who fear God’ because they are the ones to benefit from such an admonition.
ٱللَّهُ نُورُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ مَثَلُ نُورِهِ كَمِشْكَاةٍ فِيهَا مِصْبَاحٌ ٱلْمِصْبَاحُ فِي زُجَاجَةٍ ٱلزُّجَاجَةُ كَأَنَّهَا كَوْكَبٌ دُرِّيٌّ يُوقَدُ مِن شَجَرَةٍ مُّبَارَكَةٍ زَيْتُونَةٍ لاَّ شَرْقِيَّةٍ وَلاَ غَرْبِيَّةٍ يَكَادُ زَيْتُهَا يُضِيۤءُ وَلَوْ لَمْ تَمْسَسْهُ نَارٌ نُّورٌ عَلَىٰ نُورٍ يَهْدِي ٱللَّهُ لِنُورِهِ مَن يَشَآءُ وَيَضْرِبُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلأَمْثَالَ لِلنَّاسِ وَٱللَّهُ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عَلَيِمٌ,God is the Light of the heavens and the earth in other words He illumines both of them with the sun and the moon. The likeness of His Light that is the description of it as it resides in the heart of a believer is as a niche wherein is a lamp. The lamp is in a glass — this glass is the case for the lantern and the misbāh is the torch that is the wick that is lit; al-mishkāt is a recess that does not penetrate to the other side in other words the tube inside the lantern the glass with the light inside it is as it were a glittering star that is a light-giving star read dirrī’un or durrī’un derived from al-dar‘ ‘to repel’ because it repels darkness; or read durriyyun derived from al-durr ‘pearls’ kindled is this lamp read past tense tawaqqada; a variant reading has the imperfect tense of awqada in the passive voice yūqadu; another reading has tūqadu in which case the reference is to al-zujāja ‘the glass’ from the oil of a Blessed Tree an olive neither of the east nor of the west but in between the two so that no harmful cold or heat affects it; whose oil would almost glow forth of itself though no fire touched it because of the extent of its purity. Light by Him upon light by fire; the light of God is His guidance of the believer light upon the light of faith. God guides to His Light that is to the religion of Islam whom He will. And God strikes He illustrates similitudes for men by approximating such similitudes to their comprehension so that they might take heed and believe; and God is Knower of all things including knowledge of how to strike similitudes.
فِي بُيُوتٍ أَذِنَ ٱللَّهُ أَن تُرْفَعَ وَيُذْكَرَ فِيهَا ٱسْمُهُ يُسَبِّحُ لَهُ فِيهَا بِٱلْغُدُوِّ وَٱلآصَالِ,In houses fī buyūtin is semantically connected to yusabbihu ‘glorify’ that will follow whose status God has allowed to be raised houses He has allowed to be venerated and wherein His Name is remembered through the affirmation of His Oneness therein they make glorifications read yusabbahu ‘glorifications are made’ or yusabbihu meaning ‘therein pray’ to Him in the mornings al-ghuduww is a verbal noun meaning al-ghadawāt ‘the early mornings’ and the evenings the darkness after sunset
رِجَالٌ لاَّ تُلْهِيهِمْ تِجَارَةٌ وَلاَ بَيْعٌ عَن ذِكْرِ ٱللَّهِ وَإِقَامِ ٱلصَّلاَةِ وَإِيتَآءِ ٱلزَّكَـاةِ يَخَافُونَ يَوْماً تَتَقَلَّبُ فِيهِ ٱلْقُلُوبُ وَٱلأَبْصَارُ,men rijālun the subject of the verb yusabbihu ‘make glorifications’; if the passive is read yusabbahu ‘glorifications are made’ it rijālun ‘men’ substitutes for the impersonal subject of lahu ‘to Him’ so that rijālun ‘men’ is the subject of an implied verb in response to an implied question as if one had asked who makes glorifications to Him? whom neither trading purchase nor sale distracts from the remembrance of God and the observance of prayer the final hā’ of iqāmat ‘the observance’ has been omitted to facilitate the reading and payment of the alms. They fear a day when hearts and eyes will be tossed about in fear the hearts tossed about between the hope of deliverance and the fear of destruction and the eyes to the right and to the left out of anxiety — this is the Day of Resurrection;
لِيَجْزِيَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ أَحْسَنَ مَا عَمِلُواْ وَيَزِيدَهُمْ مِّن فَضْلِهِ وَٱللَّهُ يَرْزُقُ مَن يَشَآءُ بِغَيْرِ حِسَابٍ,so that God may reward them for the best of what they did that is reward them the reward for it ahsana means husna and give them more out of His bounty; and God provides whomever He will without any reckoning one says of someone yunfiqu bi-ghayri hisābin to mean that such a person is so generous that it is as though he does not need to reckon what he spends.
وَٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوۤاْ أَعْمَالُهُمْ كَسَرَابٍ بِقِيعَةٍ يَحْسَبُهُ ٱلظَّمْآنُ مَآءً حَتَّىٰ إِذَا جَآءَهُ لَمْ يَجِدْهُ شَيْئاً وَوَجَدَ ٱللَّهَ عِندَهُ فَوَفَّـٰهُ حِسَابَهُ وَٱللَّهُ سَرِيعُ ٱلْحِسَابِ,And as for those who disbelieve their works are like a mirage in a plain qī‘a is the plural of qā‘ that is to say fulāt ‘an open space’. A mirage is a kind of radiation which one might observe therein at midday during extreme heat resembling running water — which the thirsty man supposes to be water until he comes to it and finds it to be nothing like what he had supposed. Likewise is the case of the disbeliever who supposes that his deeds such as some voluntary alms will benefit him; but when he dies and comes before his Lord he will not find his deed in other words it will be of no benefit to him; and he finds God there namely in the place of his deeds Who pays him his account in full that is He requites him for it in this world; and God is swift at reckoning that is at requiting.
أَوْ كَظُلُمَاتٍ فِي بَحْرٍ لُّجِّيٍّ يَغْشَاهُ مَوْجٌ مِّن فَوْقِهِ مَوْجٌ مِّن فَوْقِهِ سَحَابٌ ظُلُمَاتٌ بَعْضُهَا فَوْقَ بَعْضٍ إِذَآ أَخْرَجَ يَدَهُ لَمْ يَكَدْ يَرَاهَا وَمَن لَّمْ يَجْعَلِ ٱللَّهُ لَهُ نُوراً فَمَا لَهُ مِن نُورٍ,Or it is that those who disbelieve their evil deeds are as the manifold darkness on a deep sea covered by a billow above which that is above which billow there is another billow above which second billow there are clouds these being the manifold layers of darkness one on top of another the darkness of the sea the darkness of the first billow the darkness of the second together with the darkness of the clouds. When he an observer holds out his hand in such layers of darkness he can scarcely see it in other words he would not even come close to seeing it. And he whom God has not granted any light has no light that is to say he whom God does not guide cannot be guided.
أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُسَبِّحُ لَهُ مَن فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَٱلطَّيْرُ صَآفَّاتٍ كُلٌّ قَدْ عَلِمَ صَلاَتَهُ وَتَسْبِيحَهُ وَٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ بِمَا يَفْعَلُونَ,Have you not seen that God is glorified by all who are in the heavens and the earth prayer being one form of glorification and the birds tayr is the plural of tā’ir between the heaven and the earth spreading their wings? sāffātin is a circumstantial qualifier. Of each one of them He God verily knows its prayer and its glorification; and God knows what they do — the statement is predominantly directed to rational beings.
وَللَّهِ مُلْكُ ٱلسَّمَاوَاتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَإِلَىٰ ٱللَّهِ ٱلْمَصِيرُ,And to God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth the treasuries of rain provision and vegetation and with God is the journey’s end the final return.
أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُزْجِي سَحَاباً ثُمَّ يُؤَلِّفُ بَيْنَهُ ثُمَّ يَجْعَلُهُ رُكَاماً فَتَرَى ٱلْوَدْقَ يَخْرُجُ مِنْ خِلاَلِهِ وَيُنَزِّلُ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مِن جِبَالٍ فِيهَا مِن بَرَدٍ فَيُصِيبُ بِهِ مَن يَشَآءُ وَيَصْرِفُهُ عَن مَّن يَشَآءُ يَكَادُ سَنَا بَرْقِهِ يَذْهَبُ بِٱلأَبْصَارِ,Have you not seen how God drives the clouds moves them along gently then composes them joining some with others and making scattered pieces as one then piles them up some on top of others whereat you see the rain issuing from the midst of them from specific outlets in them? And He sends down from the heaven out of the mountains min jibālin min is extra that are therein in the heaven fīhā substitutes for mina’l-samā’i ‘from the heaven’ with the repetition of a genitive preposition hail that is He sends down some hail and smites with it whom He will and turns it away from whom He will. The brilliance of its lightning its flashing would almost take away the eyes that look at it in other words it would almost snatching them away.
يُقَلِّبُ ٱللَّهُ ٱللَّيْلَ وَٱلنَّهَارَ إِنَّ فِي ذٰلِكَ لَعِبْرَةً لأُوْلِي ٱلأَبْصَارِ,God alternates the night and the day that is He brings one in place of the other. Surely in that alternation there is a lesson an indication for those who see those possessing insight an indication of God’s power exalted be He.
وَٱللَّهُ خَلَقَ كُلَّ دَآبَّةٍ مِّن مَّآءٍ فَمِنْهُمْ مَّن يَمْشِي عَلَىٰ بَطْنِهِ وَمِنهُمْ مَّن يَمْشِي عَلَىٰ رِجْلَيْنِ وَمِنْهُمْ مَّن يَمْشِي عَلَىٰ أَرْبَعٍ يَخْلُقُ ٱللَّهُ مَا يَشَآءُ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,And God has created every beast that is every animal from fluid from a sperm-drop. Among them are some that creep upon their bellies such as snakes and reptiles and among them are some that walk on two feet such as human beings and birds and among them are some that walk on four such as four-legged beasts and cattle. God creates whatever He will. Truly God has power over all things.
لَّقَدْ أَنزَلْنَآ آيَاتٍ مُّبَيِّنَاتٍ وَٱللَّهُ يَهْدِي مَن يَشَآءُ إِلَىٰ صِرَاطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ,And verily We have revealed manifest signs namely the Qur’ān; and God guides whomever He will to a straight path a straight route and that is the religion of Islam.
وَيَقُولُونَ آمَنَّا بِٱللَّهِ وَبِٱلرَّسُولِ وَأَطَعْنَا ثُمَّ يَتَوَلَّىٰ فَرِيقٌ مِّنْهُمْ مِّن بَعْدِ ذٰلِكَ وَمَآ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ بِٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,And they the hypocrites say ‘We believe in we affirm the truth of God of His Oneness and the Messenger Muhammad (s) and we obey’ them in what rulings they God and Muhammad give. Then after that a party of them turn away they are averse to it and those those who are averse they are not believers as believers should be believers whose hearts agree with the words of their tongues.
وَإِذَا دُعُوۤاْ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ لِيَحْكُمَ بَيْنَهُمْ إِذَا فَرِيقٌ مِّنْهُمْ مُّعْرِضُونَ,And when they are summoned to God and His Messenger who conveys His words that he may judge between them behold a party of them are averse to come to him.
وَإِن يَكُنْ لَّهُمُ ٱلْحَقُّ يَأْتُوۤاْ إِلَيْهِ مُذْعِنِينَ,But if right be on their side they would come to him willingly hastening compliantly.
أَفِي قُلُوبِهِمْ مَّرَضٌ أَمِ ٱرْتَابُوۤاْ أَمْ يَخَافُونَ أَن يَحِيفَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْهِمْ وَرَسُولُهُ بَلْ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلظَّالِمُونَ,Is there a sickness disbelief in their hearts? Or are they in doubt are they uncertain of his prophethood or do they fear that God and His Messenger will be unjust to them? in judgement in other words that they will be wronged therein? No! Rather those they are the wrongdoers for shunning him.
إِنَّمَا كَانَ قَوْلَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ إِذَا دُعُوۤاْ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ لِيَحْكُمَ بَيْنَهُمْ أَن يَقُولُواْ سَمِعْنَا وَأَطَعْنَا وَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْمُفْلِحُونَ,All that the believers say when they are summoned to God and His Messenger that he may judge between them is that they say in other words the saying that befits them is to say ‘We hear and we obey’ by responding to the summons. And those then are the successful the ones who will be saved.
وَمَن يُطِعِ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ وَيَخْشَ ٱللَّهَ وَيَتَّقْهِ فَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْفَآئِزُون,And he who obeys God and His Messenger and fears God and fears Him read yattaqh or yattaqhi by being obedient to Him those they are the winners of Paradise.
وَأَقْسَمُواْ بِٱللَّهِ جَهْدَ أَيْمَانِهِمْ لَئِنْ أَمَرْتَهُمْ لَيَخْرُجُنَّ قُل لاَّ تُقْسِمُواْ طَاعَةٌ مَّعْرُوفَةٌ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ خَبِيرٌ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ,And they swear by God solemn oaths that if you order them to participate in the struggle they will surely go forth. Say to them ‘Do not swear! Acknowledged obedience to the Prophet is better than the oaths to which you are not true. Surely God is Aware of what you do’ when you say you will obey but act otherwise.
قُلْ أَطِيعُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَأَطِيعُواْ ٱلرَّسُولَ فَإِن تَوَلَّوْاْ فَإِنَّمَا عَلَيْهِ مَا حُمِّلَ وَعَلَيْكُمْ مَّا حُمِّلْتُمْ وَإِن تُطِيعُوهُ تَهْتَدُواْ وَمَا عَلَى ٱلرَّسُولِ إِلاَّ ٱلْبَلاَغُ ٱلْمُبِينُ,Say ‘Obey God and obey the Messenger.’ But if you turn away from obedience to him tawallaw ‘you turn away’ one of the two tā’ letters in tatawallaw has been omitted; an address to them know that he is only responsible for that with which he has been charged of conveying the Message and you are responsible for that with which you have been charged of obedience to him. And if you obey him you will be rightly guided. And the Messenger’s duty is only to convey the Message clearly’.
وَعَدَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ مِنْكُمْ وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ لَيَسْتَخْلِفَنَّهُمْ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ كَمَا ٱسْتَخْلَفَ ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ وَلَيُمَكِّنَنَّ لَهُمْ دِينَهُمُ ٱلَّذِي ٱرْتَضَىٰ لَهُمْ وَلَيُبَدِّلَنَّهُمْ مِّن بَعْدِ خَوْفِهِمْ أَمْناً يَعْبُدُونَنِي لاَ يُشْرِكُونَ بِي شَيْئاً وَمَن كَفَرَ بَعْدَ ذٰلِكَ فَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْفَاسِقُونَ,God has promised those of you who believe and perform righteous deeds that He will surely make them successors in the earth in place of the disbelievers just as He made those Children of Israel who were before them successors in place of the ruling tyrants the verb may be read as active istakhlafa ‘He made them successors’ or as passive istukhlifa ‘were made successors’ and He will surely establish for them their religion which He has approved for them namely the religion of Islam by making it prevail over all religions and enrich them throughout the land so that they become masters thereof and that He will give them in exchange read wa-la-yubdilannahum or wa-la-yubaddilannahum after their fear of disbelievers security. And God fulfilled His promise to them in the way mentioned and He praises them with His words ‘They worship Me without associating anything with Me’ ya‘budūnanī lā yushrikūna bī shay’an is an independent new sentence standing as a justification for His promise. And whoever is ungrateful after that bestowal of grace from among them whoever is ungrateful for it those they are the immoral. The first to show ingratitude for that grace of God were the murderers of ‘Uthmān b. ‘Affān may God be pleased with him and they began to kill one another henceforth after having been brothers.
وَأَقِيمُواْ ٱلصَّـلاَةَ وَآتُواْ ٱلزَّكَـاةَ وَأَطِيعُواْ ٱلرَّسُولَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُرْحَمُونَ,And establish prayer and pay the alms and obey the Messenger that perhaps you may find mercy that is to say do so hoping for mercy.
لاَ تَحْسَبَنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مُعْجِزِينَ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَمَأْوَٰهُمُ ٱلنَّارُ وَلَبِئْسَ ٱلْمَصِيرُ,And do not suppose read tahsabanna or yahsabanna the subject of the verb being the Messenger that those who disbelieve can escape Us in the land by eluding us. For their abode will be their return will be to the Fire and it is surely an evil destination it is an evil place of return.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ لِيَسْتَأْذِنكُمُ ٱلَّذِينَ مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَـٰنُكُمْ وَٱلَّذِينَ لَمْ يَبْلُغُواْ ٱلْحُلُمَ مِنكُمْ ثَلاَثَ مَرَّاتٍ مِّن قَبْلِ صَـلَٰوةِ ٱلْفَجْرِ وَحِينَ تَضَعُونَ ثِيَـٰبَكُمْ مِّنَ ٱلظَّهِيرَةِ وَمِن بَعْدِ صَلَٰوةِ ٱلْعِشَآءِ ثَلاَثُ عَوْرَاتٍ لَّكُمْ لَيْسَ عَلَيْكُمْ وَلاَ عَلَيْهِمْ جُنَاحٌ بَعْدَهُنَّ طَوَٰفُونَ عَلَيْكُمْ بَعْضُكُمْ عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ كَذَلِكَ يُبَيِّنُ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمُ ٱلأَيَـٰتِ وَٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ حَكِيمٌ,O you who believe let those whom your right hands own of male slaves and female slaves and those of you who have not reached puberty from among the free men and who have not become sexually aware of women ask leave of you three times at three times of the day before the dawn prayer and when you put off your garments at noon and after the night prayer. These are three periods of privacy for you read thalāthu ‘awrātin lakum with nominative inflection as the predicate of an implied subject followed by a genitive annexation with the annexed term standing in place thereof of the predicate in other words the implied predicate followed by the annexation is hiya awqāt ‘these are times of …’; or read thalātha ‘awrātin lakum in the accusative the implication being that awqāta is itself in the accusative as a substitute for the syntactical status of what precedes it in place of which stands the annexed term. It is because clothes are taken off that private parts are revealed during such periods. Neither you nor they namely slaves and young boys would be at fault in entering upon you without asking leave at other times that is after the three times of day specified; they frequent you to provide service as some of you do with others this sentence corroborates the preceding one. So just as He has clarified what has been mentioned God clarifies for you the signs the rulings; and God is Knower of the affairs of His creatures Wise in what He has ordained for them. It is said that the ‘permission’ verse āyat al-isti’idhān was abrogated; but it is also said that it was not abrogated but that people thought little of neglecting to seek permission in such situations.
وَإِذَا بَلَغَ ٱلأَطْفَالُ مِنكُمُ ٱلْحُلُمَ فَلْيَسْتَأْذِنُواْ كَمَا ٱسْتَأْذَنَ ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ كَذٰلِكَ يُبَيِّنُ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمْ آيَاتِهِ وَٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ حَكِيمٌ,And when the children among you O free men reach puberty let them seek permission at all times just as those now older free men sought permission before them. So God clarifies His signs for you and God is Knower Wise.
وَٱلْقَوَاعِدُ مِنَ ٱلنِّسَآءِ ٱلَّلاَتِي لاَ يَرْجُونَ نِكَاحاً فَلَيْسَ عَلَيْهِنَّ جُنَاحٌ أَن يَضَعْنَ ثِيَابَهُنَّ غَيْرَ مُتَبَرِّجَاتٍ بِزِينَةٍ وَأَن يَسْتَعْفِفْنَ خَيْرٌ لَّهُنَّ وَٱللَّهُ سَمِيعٌ عِلِيمٌ,And as for menopausal women who have ceased to menstruate or to bear children because of old age who do not expect to marry for that reason they would not be at fault if they put off their clothes such a robe a cloak or the facial mask over a head veil in such a way as not to display adornment that is hidden such as a necklace a bracelet or an anklet; but to refrain from doing so by not putting them off is better for them; and God is Hearer of what you say Knower of what is in your hearts.
لَّيْسَ عَلَى ٱلأَعْمَىٰ حَرَجٌ وَلاَ عَلَى ٱلأَعْرَجِ حَرَجٌ وَلاَ عَلَى ٱلْمَرِيضِ حَرَجٌ وَلاَ عَلَىٰ أَنفُسِكُمْ أَن تَأْكُلُواْ مِن بُيُوتِكُمْ أَوْ بُيُوتِ ءَابَآئِكُمْ أَوْ بُيُوتِ أُمَّهَٰتِكُمْ أَوْ بُيُوتِ إِخْوَٰنِكُمْ أَوْ بُيُوتِ أَخَوَٰتِكُمْ أَوْ بُيُوتِ أَعْمَٰمِكُمْ أَوْ بُيُوتِ عَمَّٰتِكُمْ أَوْ بُيُوتِ أَخْوَٰلِكُمْ أَوْ بُيُوتِ خَٰلَٰتِكُمْ أَوْ مَا مَلَكْتُمْ مَّفَاتِحهُ أَوْ صَدِيقِكُمْ لَيْسَ عَلَيْكُمْ جُنَاحٌ أَن تَأْكُلُواْ جَمِيعاً أَوْ أَشْتَاتاً فَإِذَا دَخَلْتُمْ بُيُوتاً فَسَلِّمُواْ عَلَىٰ أَنفُسِكُمْ تَحِيَّةً مِّنْ عِندِ ٱللَّهِ مُبَٰرَكَةً طَيِّبَةً كَذَٰلِكَ يُبَيِّنُ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمُ ٱلأيَٰتِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ,There is no blame upon the blind nor any blame upon the lame nor any blame upon the sick that they be one’s table companions nor any blame upon yourselves if you eat from your own houses that is from the houses of your offspring or your fathers’ houses or your mothers’ houses or your brothers’ houses or your sisters’ houses or the houses of your paternal uncles or the houses of your paternal aunts or the houses of your maternal uncles or the houses of your maternal aunts or from that whereof you hold the keys from that which you safeguard on behalf of others or from those of your faithful friends sadīq is so called because he is ‘faithful’ sadaqa to you in his affection. In other words one is permitted to eat from the houses of those mentioned even if they are not present provided that they consent to it. You would not be at fault whether you eat together in a group or separately individually ashtāt is the plural of shatt. This was revealed concerning those who felt inhibited about eating alone and who when they could not find a table companion they would refrain from eating. But when you enter houses that are yours houses wherein there is no one bid peace to yourselves say ‘Peace be upon us and upon God’s righteous servants’ for the angels will return your greeting; and if there is family therein bid peace to them with a salutation tahiyyatan is the verbal noun from hayyā ‘he saluted’ from God blessed and good and for which one is rewarded. So God clarifies the signs for you that is to say He sets out for you in detail the ritual ceremonies of your religion that perhaps you might comprehend in order for you to understand this.
إِنَّمَا ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ بِٱللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ وَإِذَا كَانُواْ مَعَهُ عَلَىٰ أَمْرٍ جَامِعٍ لَّمْ يَذْهَبُواْ حَتَّىٰ يَسْتَأْذِنُوهُ إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يَسْتَأْذِنُونَكَ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ فَإِذَا ٱسْتَأْذَنُوكَ لِبَعْضِ شَأْنِهِمْ فَأْذَن لِّمَن شِئْتَ مِنْهُمْ وَٱسْتَغْفِرْ لَهُمُ ٱللَّهَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,Only they are believers who believe in God and His Messenger and who when they are with him namely the Messenger in a collective affair such as during the Friday sermon do not leave when they have an excuse until they have asked leave of him. Truly those who ask leave of you — it is they who believe in God and His Messenger. So when they ask leave of you for some affair some matter of theirs give permission to whom you will of them to leave and ask God to forgive them. Truly God is Forgiving Merciful.
لاَّ تَجْعَلُواْ دُعَآءَ ٱلرَّسُولِ بَيْنَكُمْ كَدُعَآءِ بَعْضِكُمْ بَعْضاً قَدْ يَعْلَمُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِينَ يَتَسَلَّلُونَ مِنكُمْ لِوَاذاً فَلْيَحْذَرِ ٱلَّذِينَ يُخَالِفُونَ عَنْ أَمْرِهِ أَن تُصِيبَهُمْ فِتْنَةٌ أَوْ يُصِيبَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,Do not among yourselves consider the calling of the Messenger to be like your calling of one another by saying ‘O Muhammad!’ s but say ‘O Prophet of God’ or ‘O Messenger of God!’ gently respectfully and in a low voice. Verily God knows those of you who slip away surreptitiously that is those who leave the mosque secretly during the sermon without asking leave hiding behind something qad ‘verily’ is for confirmation. So let those who contravene His command that is God’s command or that of His Messenger beware lest an ordeal a trial befall them or there befall them a painful chastisement in the Hereafter.
أَلاۤ إِنَّ للَّهِ مَا فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ قَدْ يَعْلَمُ مَآ أَنتُمْ عَلَيْهِ وَيَوْمَ يُرْجَعُونَ إِلَيْهِ فَيُنَبِّئُهُمْ بِمَا عَمِلُواْ وَٱللَّهُ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عَلِيمُ,Lo! surely to God belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth by way of possession creation and servitude. He is ever aware of how you O you who are obligated to the prescriptions of the Law are behaving with regard to faith or hypocrisy and He knows the day when they shall be returned to Him there is a shift here from the second person address to that of the third person in other words He knows when this day will be — He will inform them thereupon of what they did of good and evil and God is Knower of all things which they do and otherwise.
تَبَارَكَ ٱلَّذِي نَزَّلَ ٱلْفُرْقَانَ عَلَىٰ عَبْدِهِ لِيَكُونَ لِلْعَالَمِينَ نَذِيراً,Blessed exalted is He Who revealed the Criterion al-furqān the Qur’ān — called thus al-furqān because it has discriminated faraqa between truth and falsehood — to His servant Muhammad (s) that he may be to all the worlds to mankind and the jinn but not the angels a warner a threatening of God’s chastisement.
ٱلَّذِي لَهُ مُلْكُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَلَمْ يَتَّخِذْ وَلَداً وَلَمْ يَكُن لَّهُ شَرِيكٌ فِي المُلْكِ وَخَلَقَ كُلَّ شَيْءٍ فَقَدَّرَهُ تَقْدِيراً,He to Whom belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and Who has not taken a son nor has He any partner in sovereignty; and He created everything which was meant to be created and then determined it in a precise measure He fashioned it in a balanced form.
وَٱتَّخَذُواْ مِن دُونِهِ آلِهَةً لاَّ يَخْلُقُونَ شَيْئاً وَهُمْ يُخْلَقُونَ وَلاَ يَمْلِكُونَ لأَنْفُسِهِمْ ضَرّاً وَلاَ نَفْعاً وَلاَ يَمْلِكُونَ مَوْتاً وَلاَ حَيَـاةً وَلاَ نُشُوراً,Yet they the disbelievers have taken besides Him that is besides God in other words other than Him gods from among the idols who create nothing but have themselves been created and who possess no harm for themselves that is the power to repel it nor any benefit that is the power to attract it nor do they possess any power over death or life that is nor do they have the power to make a person die or to give him life or resurrection that is nor do they have power to raise the dead.
وَقَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوۤاْ إِنْ هَـٰذَا إِلاَّ إِفْكٌ ٱفْتَرَاهُ وَأَعَانَهُ عَلَيْهِ قَوْمٌ آخَرُونَ فَقَدْ جَآءُوا ظُلْماً وَزُوراً,And those who disbelieve say ‘This Qur’ān is nothing but a calumny a lie that he Muhammad (s) has invented and other folk have helped him with it’ who according to the disbelievers were from among the People of the Scripture. God exalted be He says Verily thus they have committed wrong and spoken falsehood they have come with disbelief and mendacity.
وَقَالُوۤاْ أَسَاطِيرُ ٱلأَوَّلِينَ ٱكْتَتَبَهَا فَهِيَ تُمْلَىٰ عَلَيْهِ بُكْرَةً وَأَصِيلاً,And they say that it the Qur’ān is also ‘Fables their lies asātir is the plural of ustūra of the ancients which he has had written down that he has had someone from among those people copy it down for him so that they are read to him for him to memorise morning and evening’. God exalted be He responds to them saying
قُلْ أَنزَلَهُ ٱلَّذِي يَعْلَمُ ٱلسِّرَّ فِي ٱلسَّمَاوَاتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ إِنَّهُ كَانَ غَفُوراً رَّحِيماً,Say ‘It has been revealed by Him Who knows the secret the Unseen of the heavens and the earth. Truly He is ever Forgiving of believers Merciful’ to them.
وَقَالُواْ مَالِ هَـٰذَا ٱلرَّسُولِ يَأْكُلُ ٱلطَّعَامَ وَيَمْشِي فِي ٱلأَسْوَاقِ لَوْلاۤ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْهِ مَلَكٌ فَيَكُونَ مَعَهُ نَذِيراً,And they also say ‘What is it with this Messenger that he eats food and walks about in the marketplaces? Why has an angel not been sent down to him so as to be a warner along with him? and confirm his truthfulness.
أَوْ يُلْقَىٰ إِلَيْهِ كَنْزٌ أَوْ تَكُونُ لَهُ جَنَّةٌ يَأْكُلُ مِنْهَا وَقَالَ ٱلظَّالِمُونَ إِن تَتَّبِعُونَ إِلاَّ رَجُلاً مَّسْحُوراً,Or a treasure thrown down to him from the heaven for him to spend from so as not to be in need of walking through the marketplaces in order to earn his livelihood. Or he has a garden an orchard for him to eat from?’ that is to eat from its fruits and satisfy himself therewith a variant reading for ya’kulu ‘for him to eat’ has na’kulu ‘for us to eat’ and thus possess because of that garden an advantage over us. The wrongdoers namely the disbelievers say to the believers ‘You are just following a man bewitched!’ one duped his mind overcome. God exalted be He says
ٱنظُرْ كَيْفَ ضَرَبُواْ لَكَ ٱلأَمْثَالَ فَضَلُّواْ فَلاَ يَسْتَطِيعُونَ سَبِيلاً,See how they strike similitudes for you of the fact that the Prophet is a person bewitched and one in need of something to expend from and of an angel to help him carry out the task of delivering the Message so that they go astray thereby from guidance and are unable to find a way a means thereto to guidance.
تَبَارَكَ ٱلَّذِيۤ إِن شَآءَ جَعَلَ لَكَ خَيْراً مِّن ذٰلِكَ جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلأَنْهَارُ وَيَجْعَل لَّكَ قُصُوراً,Blessed is He abundant is the good of God Who if He will will give you better than that treasure or orchard which they mentioned — gardens underneath which rivers flow in this world for He has already willed to give him such things in the Hereafter and will give read apocopated form wa-yaj‘al you palaces as well a variant reading of the apocopated yaj‘al is yaj‘alu ‘He will give’ beginning a new sentence.
بَلْ كَذَّبُواْ بِٱلسَّاعَةِ وَأَعْتَدْنَا لِمَن كَذَّبَ بِٱلسَّاعَةِ سَعِيراً,Nay but they deny the coming of the Hour the Resurrection and We have prepared for those who deny the Hour a blaze sa‘īr a fire that has been set ablaze musa‘‘ara in other words an intense fire.
إِذَا رَأَتْهُمْ مِّن مَّكَانٍ بَعِيدٍ سَمِعُواْ لَهَا تَغَيُّظاً وَزَفِيراً,When it sees them from a distant place they will hear it raging boiling like an enraged person when his heart boils with anger and roaring producing a powerful noise. Alternatively what is meant by their ‘hearing it raging’ is their vision of it and awareness of it.
وَإَذَآ أُلْقُواْ مِنْهَا مَكَاناً ضَيِّقاً مُّقَرَّنِينَ دَعَوْاْ هُنَالِكَ ثُبُوراً,And when they are flung into a narrow place thereof read dayyiqan or dayqan ‘narrow’ such that it constricts them; minhā ‘thereof’ is a circumstantial qualifier referring to makānan ‘place’ because it is actually an adjectival qualification of it bound together shackled with their hands bound to their necks in chains the use of the intensive form muqarranīna as opposed to muqranīna is meant to indicate a large number they will at that point pray for their own annihilation and it will be said to them
لاَّ تَدْعُواْ ٱلْيَوْمَ ثُبُوراً وَاحِداً وَٱدْعُواْ ثُبُوراً كَثِيراً,‘Do not pray for a single annihilation on this day but pray for many annihilations!’ which will be the nature of your chastisement.
قُلْ أَذٰلِكَ خَيْرٌ أَمْ جَنَّةُ ٱلْخُلْدِ ٱلَّتِي وُعِدَ ٱلْمُتَّقُونَ كَانَتْ لَهُمْ جَزَآءً وَمَصِيراً,Say ‘Is that which is mentioned of the threat of chastisement and the description of the Fire better or the Garden of Immortality which has been promised to the God-fearing which will be in God’s knowledge exalted be He their requital their reward and journey’s end?’ their place of return.
لَّهُمْ فِيهَا مَا يَشَآءُونَ خَالِدِينَ كَانَ عَلَىٰ رَبِّكَ وَعْداً مَّسْئُولاً,In it they shall have what they wish abiding therein — an irrevocable state — it the promise to them of what is mentioned is a promise binding on your Lord a promise much besought requested by those who have been promised it as is clear from the following Our Lord grant us what You have promised us through Your messengers Q. 3194 or requested on their behalf by the angels who say Our Lord and admit them into the Gardens of Eden which You have promised them Q. 408.
وَيَوْمَ يَحْشُرُهُمْ وَمَا يَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ فَيَقُولُ أَأَنتُمْ أَضْلَلْتُمْ عِبَادِي هَؤُلاَءِ أَمْ هُمْ ضَلُّوا ٱلسَّبِيلَ,And on the day when He will assemble them yahshuruhum; a variant reading has nahshuruhum ‘We assemble them’ and that which they worship besides God that is other than Him such as the angels Jesus Ezra and the jinn and will say exalted be He fa-yaqūlu; a variant has fa-naqūlu and We shall say’ to those who were worshipped as a way of establishing the argument against the worshippers of the former ‘Was it you read a-antum pronouncing both hamzas or by substituting the second one with an alif or not pronouncing this last and inserting an alif between the one not pronounced and the former or without such an insertion who misled these servants of Mine causing them to fall into error by commanding them to worship you or did they go astray from the way? the path of truth by themselves?
قَالُواْ سُبْحَانَكَ مَا كَانَ يَنبَغِي لَنَآ أَن نَّتَّخِذَ مِن دُونِكَ مِنْ أَوْلِيَآءَ وَلَـٰكِن مَّتَّعْتَهُمْ وَآبَآءَهُمْ حَتَّىٰ نَسُواْ ٱلذِّكْرَ وَكَانُواْ قَوْماً بُوراً,They will say ‘Glory be to You — exalted be You above what does not befit You! It was not it would not have been right for us to take any guardians besides You that is other than You min awliyā’a the first direct object the min being extra added to emphasise the negation; the preceding min dūnika ‘besides You’ is the second direct object. So how can we command that we be worshipped? But You gave them and their fathers before them ease of living by granting them long life and abundant provision until they forgot the Remembrance until they became remiss about admonitions and belief in the Qur’ān and became a lost folk’ a folk destroyed. God exalted be He says
فَقَدْ كَذَّبُوكُمْ بِمَا تَقُولُونَ فَمَا تَسْتَطِيعُونَ صَرْفاً وَلاَ نَصْراً وَمَن يَظْلِم مِّنكُمْ نُذِقْهُ عَذَاباً كَبِيراً,Thus they will deny you that is the ones who were worshipped denied those who worshipped them in what you allege namely that they are gods and they will neither be able to read yastatī‘ūna or second person plural tastatī‘ūna in other words neither they nor you will be able to circumvent ward off the chastisement from you nor help nor protect you from it. And whoever of you does evil whoever ascribes partners to God We shall make him taste an awful a severe chastisement in the Hereafter.
وَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَا قَبْلَكَ مِنَ ٱلْمُرْسَلِينَ إِلاَّ إِنَّهُمْ لَيَأْكُلُونَ ٱلطَّعَامَ وَيَمْشُونَ فِي ٱلأَسْوَاقِ وَجَعَلْنَا بَعْضَكُمْ لِبَعْضٍ فِتْنَةً أَتَصْبِرُونَ وَكَانَ رَبُّكَ بَصِيراً,And We did not send before you any messengers but that they ate food and walked in the marketplaces and so you are like them in this respect and truly what was said to them is being said to you. And We have made some of you a trial for others a test trying the rich with the poor the healthy with the sick the honourable with the vulgar in each case the latter would say ‘Why can I not be like the other person?’ Will you be steadfast? and endure what you hear from those with whom you are tried? the interrogative is meant as an imperative in other words ‘Be steadfast!’. And your Lord is ever Watchful of those who remain steadfast and those who become miserable.
وَقَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ لاَ يَرْجُونَ لِقَآءَنَا لَوْلاَ أُنْزِلَ عَلَيْنَا ٱلْمَلاَئِكَةُ أَوْ نَرَىٰ رَبَّنَا لَقَدِ ٱسْتَكْبَرُواْ فِيۤ أَنفُسِهِمْ وَعَتَوْا عُتُوّاً كَبِيراً,And those who do not expect to encounter Us those who have no fear of the Resurrection say ‘Why have the angels not been sent down to us to act as messengers to us or why do we not see our Lord?’ so that we might be informed by Him that Muhammad (s) is truly His Messenger? God exalted be He says Assuredly they are full of arrogance within their souls and have become terribly insolent in demanding to see God exalted be He in this world read ‘utuwwan ‘insolence’ with the wāw according to the original root form as opposed to ‘itiyyan with the yā’ substitution as in sūrat Maryam Q. 198.
يَوْمَ يَرَوْنَ ٱلْمَلاَئِكَةَ لاَ بُشْرَىٰ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُجْرِمِينَ وَيَقُولُونَ حِجْراً مَّحْجُوراً,The day when they see the angels while they stand together with the rest of creation namely on the Day of Resurrection yawma is in the accusative because of an implied preceding udhkur ‘mention’ there will be no good tidings on that day for the guilty that is the disbelievers in contrast to the believers for whom there shall be the good tidings of Paradise and they will say ‘A forbidding ban!’ as was their the pagan custom in this world whenever a misfortune befell them; in other words they mean ‘awdhan ma‘ādhan seeking refuge from the angels who will chastise them. God exalted be He says
وَقَدِمْنَآ إِلَىٰ مَا عَمِلُواْ مِنْ عَمَلٍ فَجَعَلْنَاهُ هَبَآءً مَّنثُوراً,And We shall attend to We shall turn to the works they did that were good such as voluntary alms or kindness to kin a hospitable reception of a guest or the succour of a troubled person in this world and turn them into scattered dust habā’an manthūran namely as those individual particles of dust which one might observe near a window when the sun is shining through. In other words We shall make their good works like those particles of dust in their uselessness there being no reward for such works for lack of any binding obligation to reward them therefor; but they are rewarded for it in the life of this world.
أَصْحَابُ ٱلْجَنَّةِ يَوْمَئِذٍ خَيْرٌ مُّسْتَقَرّاً وَأَحْسَنُ مَقِيلاً,Those who will be the inhabitants of Paradise on that day the Day of Resurrection will be in a far better abode than are the disbelievers in this world and a far better resting place than theirs the latter’s; in other words a better place for qā’ila which is a rest taken during midday during hot days. From this last interpretation of maqīlan it has been inferred that the Reckoning will be concluded in half a day as is stated in one hadīth.
وَيَوْمَ تَشَقَّقُ ٱلسَّمَآءُ بِٱلْغَمَامِ وَنُزِّلَ ٱلْمَلاَئِكَةُ تَنزِيلاً,And on the day when the heaven each of the seven heavens will be split asunder with the clouds in other words split asunder together with them the clouds al-ghamām is white cloud and the angels will be sent down from every heaven in a majestic descent and this is the Day of Resurrection it yawma ‘on the day’ is in the accusative because of an implied preceding udhkur ‘mention’; a variant reading for tashaqqaqu is tashshaqqaqu ‘will be split asunder’ where the second tā’ of the original form tatashaqqaqu has been assimilated with it the the shīn; another variant reading instead of nuzzila al-malā’ikatu ‘the angels will be sent down’ has nunzilu al-malā’ikata ‘We will send down the angels’;
ٱلْمُلْكُ يَوْمَئِذٍ ٱلْحَقُّ لِلرَّحْمَـٰنِ وَكَانَ يَوْماً عَلَى ٱلْكَافِرِينَ عَسِيراً,true Sovereignty on that day will belong to the Compassionate One with no one else sharing it with Him and it that day will be a hard day for the disbelievers in contrast to the believers.
وَيَوْمَ يَعَضُّ ٱلظَّالِمُ عَلَىٰ يَدَيْهِ يَقُولُ يٰلَيْتَنِي ٱتَّخَذْتُ مَعَ ٱلرَّسُولِ سَبِيلاً,And it will be a day when the wrongdoer the idolater ‘Uqba b. Abī Mu‘ayt — who had uttered the two-part profession ‘there is no god but God Muhammad (s) is His Messenger’ but retracted it in order to please Ubayy b. Khalaf — will bite his hands in regret and anguish on the Day of Resurrection saying ‘O yā is for drawing attention would that I had followed a way with the Messenger! Muhammad (s) a route to guidance.
يَٰوَيْلَتَىٰ لَيْتَنِي لَمْ أَتَّخِذْ فُلاَناً خَلِيلاً,O woe to me! yā waylatā the final alif stands in place of the first person singular possessive yā’ yā waylatī meaning ‘alas for my destruction!’ Would that I had not taken so and so in other words that Ubayy as friend!
لَّقَدْ أَضَلَّنِي عَنِ ٱلذِّكْرِ بَعْدَ إِذْ جَآءَنِي وَكَانَ ٱلشَّيْطَانُ لِلإِنْسَانِ خَذُولاً,Verily he has led me astray from the Remembrance namely the Qur’ān after it had come to me by causing me to recant my belief in it. God exalted be He says And Satan is ever a deserter of the disbelieving man’ abandoning him and dissociating from him in times of tribulation.
وَقَالَ ٱلرَّسُولُ يٰرَبِّ إِنَّ قَوْمِي ٱتَّخَذُواْ هَـٰذَا ٱلْقُرْآنَ مَهْجُوراً,And the Messenger Muhammad (s) says ‘O my Lord lo! my people the tribe of Quraysh consider this Qur’ān as something to be shunned’ to be disregarded.
وَكَذَلِكَ جَعَلْنَا لِكُلِّ نَبِيٍّ عَدُوّاً مِّنَ ٱلْمُجْرِمِينَ وَكَفَىٰ بِرَبِّكَ هَادِياً وَنَصِيراً,God exalted be He says So just as We have appointed for you enemies from among the idolaters of your people We have appointed to every prophet before you an enemy from among the guilty the idolaters — so be steadfast as they were; but your Lord suffices as a Guide for you and a Helper to bring you victory over your enemies.
وَقَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لَوْلاَ نُزِّلَ عَلَيْهِ ٱلْقُرْآنُ جُمْلَةً وَاحِدَةً كَذَلِكَ لِنُثَبِّتَ بِهِ فُؤَادَكَ وَرَتَّلْنَاهُ تَرْتِيلاً,And those who disbelieve say ‘Why has the Qur’ān not been revealed to him all at once?’ as the Torah the Gospel and the Book of Psalms were. God exalted be He says We have revealed it thus in parts it is that We may strengthen your inner-heart with it and We have arranged it in a specific order that is to say We produce it in stages one part after another gradually and deliberately in order to facilitate its comprehension and its memorisation.
وَلاَ يَأْتُونَكَ بِمَثَلٍ إِلاَّ جِئْنَاكَ بِٱلْحَقِّ وَأَحْسَنَ تَفْسِيراً,And they do not bring you any similitude to invalidate your mission but that We bring you the truth that refutes it and what is better as exposition explanation.
ٱلَّذِينَ يُحْشَرُونَ عَلَىٰ وُجُوهِهِمْ إِلَىٰ جَهَنَّمَ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ شَرٌّ مَّكَاناً وَأَضَلُّ سَبِيلاً,They are those who will be gathered on their faces that is those who will be driven as cattle toward Hell they will be in the worst place namely Hell and furthest astray from the way they will be on a path of error worse than that of others; and this path is their disbelief.
وَلَقَدْ آتَيْنَا مُوسَى ٱلْكِتَابَ وَجَعَلْنَا مَعَهُ أَخَاهُ هَارُونَ وَزِيراً,And verily We gave Moses the Scripture the Torah and made Aaron his brother go with him as a minister an assistant.
فَقُلْنَا ٱذْهَبَآ إِلَى ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلَّذِينَ كَذَّبُواْ بِآيَاتِنَا فَدَمَّرْنَاهُمْ تَدْمِيراً,Then We said ‘Go both of you to the people who have denied Our signs’ that is to the Egyptians — Pharaoh and his folk. So they went to them with the Message but they the Egyptians denied both of them. Then We destroyed them utterly.
وَقَوْمَ نُوحٍ لَّمَّا كَذَّبُواْ ٱلرُّسُلَ أَغْرَقْنَاهُمْ وَجَعَلْنَاهُمْ لِلنَّاسِ آيَةً وَأَعْتَدْنَا لِلظَّالِمِينَ عَذَاباً أَلِيماً,And mention the people of Noah when they denied the messengers in denying Noah — it is as though he were many messengers given the length of time he remained among them; or it is thus expressed in the plural because to deny him is equivalent to denying all the other messengers for they all came with the same Message concerning affirmation of God’s Oneness — We drowned them this is the response to lammā ‘when’ and made them a sign a lesson for mankind thereafter and We have prepared in the Hereafter for the evildoers the disbelievers a painful chastisement in addition to what chastisement may befall them in this world.
وَعَاداً وَثَمُودَاْ وَأَصْحَابَ ٱلرَّسِّ وَقُرُوناً بَيْنَ ذَلِكَ كَثِيراً,And mention ‘Ād the people of Hūd and Thamūd the people of Sālih and the dwellers at al-Rass al-rass — the name of a ‘well’; their prophet is said to have been Shu‘ayb; although some say it was someone else. The story is that they had been sitting around it on one occasion when it collapsed beneath them burying them together with their dwellings. And many generations peoples in between that is between the people of ‘Ād and the dwellers at al-Rass.
وَكُلاًّ ضَرَبْنَا لَهُ ٱلأَمْثَالَ وَكُلاًّ تَبَّرْنَا تَتْبِيراً,For each of them We struck similitudes when establishing arguments against them and We destroyed them only after warning them and each of them We ruined utterly We destroyed utterly because of their denial of the prophets sent to them.
وَلَقَدْ أَتَوْا عَلَى ٱلْقَرْيَةِ ٱلَّتِيۤ أُمْطِرَتْ مَطَرَ ٱلسَّوْءِ أَفَلَمْ يَكُونُواْ يَرَوْنَهَا بَلْ كَانُواْ لاَ يَرْجُونَ نُشُوراً,And verily they namely the disbelievers of Mecca will have passed by the town on which an evil shower was rained al-saw’ ‘evil’ is the verbal noun from sā’a ‘was evil’ that is it was showered with stones. This was the principal town of the towns inhabited by the people of Lot; God destroyed its inhabitants for their committing acts of lewdness. Can it be that they have not seen it? on their journeys to Syria and so take heed thereof? the interrogative is affirmative. Nay but it is that they do not expect they have no fear of any resurrection and so they do not believe.
وَإِذَا رَأَوْكَ إِن يَتَّخِذُونَكَ إِلاَّ هُزُواً أَهَـٰذَا ٱلَّذِي بَعَثَ ٱللَّهُ رَسُولاً,And when they see you they take you in mockery only as an object of derision saying ‘Is this the one whom God has sent as a messenger? as he is wont to claim? — contemptuously of him as one not worthy of being a messenger.
إِن كَادَ لَيُضِلُّنَا عَنْ آلِهَتِنَا لَوْلاَ أَن صَبْرَنَا عَلَيْهَا وَسَوْفَ يَعْلَمُونَ حِينَ يَرَوْنَ ٱلْعَذَابَ مَنْ أَضَلُّ سَبِيلاً,Indeed in softened in place of the hardened form with its subject omitted namely innahu he was about to lead us astray turn us away from our gods had we not stood by them’ he would have turned us away from them. God exalted be He says And soon they will know when they behold the chastisement with their own eyes in the Hereafter who is further astray from the way who is further upon the path of error they or the believers?
أَرَأَيْتَ مَنِ ٱتَّخَذَ إِلَـٰهَهُ هَوَاهُ أَفَأَنتَ تَكُونُ عَلَيْهِ وَكِيلاً,Have you seen — inform Me about — him who has taken as his god his own desire? that is as something that will be bring about his ruin the indirect object ilāhahu ‘as his god’ precedes the direct object because it is more important; the clause beginning man ittakhadha ‘him who has taken’ constitutes the first direct object of a-ra’ayta ‘have you seen’ the second being the following a-fa-anta … Will you be a guardian over him? a protector to preserve him from following his desires? No.
أَمْ تَحْسَبُ أَنَّ أَكْثَرَهُمْ يَسْمَعُونَ أَوْ يَعْقِلُونَ إِنْ هُمْ إِلاَّ كَٱلأَنْعَامِ بَلْ هُمْ أَضَلُّ سَبِيلاً,Or do you suppose that most of them listen listening so as to understand or comprehend? what you say to them? They are but as the cattle — nay but they are further astray from the way further from these cattle upon the path of misguidance for at least they cattle yield to the person who looks after them whereas these disbelievers do not obey their Master Who is gracious to them.
أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَىٰ رَبِّكَ كَيْفَ مَدَّ ٱلظِّلَّ وَلَوْ شَآءَ لَجَعَلَهُ سَاكِناً ثُمَّ جَعَلْنَا ٱلشَّمْسَ عَلَيْهِ دَلِيلاً,Have you not seen contemplated the work of your Lord how He extends the twilight shadow? from the point of daybreak to the point of sunrise. For had He your Lord willed He would have made it still ever-present so that it does not disappear with the rising of the sun. Then We made the sun an indicator of it of the shadow; were it not for the sun the shadow would not have been known.
ثُمَّ قَبَضْنَاهُ إِلَيْنَا قَبْضاً يَسِيراً,Then We retract it the extended shadow to Us by gentle retraction subtle retraction through the rising of the sun.
وَهُوَ الَّذِي جَعَلَ لَكُمُ ٱلَّيلَ لِبَاساً وَٱلنَّوْمَ سُبَاتاً وَجَعَلَ ٱلنَّهَارَ نُشُوراً,And He it is Who made for you the night as a garment veiling you like a garment and sleep for repose rest for bodies through the temporary cessation of labour and He made the day for rising a time in which all rise to seek their livelihood and so on.
وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِيۤ أَرْسَلَ ٱلرِّيَاحَ بُشْرَاً بَيْنَ يَدَيْ رَحْمَتِهِ وَأَنزَلْنَا مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مَآءً طَهُوراً,And He it is Who sends forth the winds al-riyāha; a variant has al-rīha ‘the wind’ dispersing before His mercy nushuran ‘dispersing’ scattered before the coming of the rain a variant reading has nushran the singular of which is nashūr similar in pattern to rasūl ‘messenger’ plural rusul; another reading has nashran as a verbal noun; and a third variant has bushran in other words the winds function as mubashshirāt ‘bearers of good tidings’ the singular of which is bashīr; and We send down from the heaven purifying water
لِّنُحْيِـيَ بِهِ بَلْدَةً مَّيْتاً وَنُسْقِيَهُ مِمَّا خَلَقْنَآ أَنْعَاماً وَأَنَاسِيَّ كَثِيراً,with which We revive a dead land read maytan in the softened form equally valid for the masculine and the feminine but in the masculine here because of the masculine noun indicating ‘place’ implicit therein and We give it the water as drink to the many cattle camels cows and sheep and humans We have created anāsiyy is the plural of insān properly it the plural should be anāsīn but the final nūn has been replaced with a yā’ with which the other yā’ has been assimilated; or it anāsiyy is simply the plural of insiyy.
وَلَقَدْ صَرَّفْنَاهُ بَيْنَهُمْ لِيَذَّكَّرُواْ فَأَبَىٰ أَكْثَرُ ٱلنَّاسِ إِلاَّ كُفُوراً,And verily We have distributed it the water among them so that they may remember li-yadhdhakkarū should actually be li-yatadhakkarū but the tā’ has been assimilated with the dhāl; a variant reading has li-yadhkurū that is to say so that they may remember therewith the grace of God. But most people are only intent on ingratitude on denial of the grace saying ‘We have received this rain because of such-and-such a storm’.
وَلَوْ شِئْنَا لَبَعَثْنَا فِي كُلِّ قَرْيَةٍ نَّذِيراً,And had We willed We could have sent forth in every town a warner to threaten its inhabitants with God’s chastisement; instead We have sent you to the inhabitants of all towns as a warner for your reward to be a great one.
فَلاَ تُطِعِ ٱلْكَافِرِينَ وَجَاهِدْهُمْ بِهِ جِهَاداً كَبيراً,So do not obey the disbelievers in their desires but struggle against them therewith that is through adherence to the Qur’ān with a great endeavour.
وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِي مَرَجَ ٱلْبَحْرَيْنِ هَـٰذَا عَذْبٌ فُرَاتٌ وَهَـٰذَا مِلْحٌ أُجَاجٌ وَجَعَلَ بَيْنَهُمَا بَرْزَخاً وَحِجْراً مَّحْجُوراً,And He it is Who merged the two seas letting them flow one adjacent to the other this one palatable sweet and the other saltish bitter; and He set between the two an isthmus so that the one does not mix with the other and a forbidding ban a shield that prevents the two from becoming mixed.
وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِي خَلَقَ مِنَ ٱلْمَآءِ بَشَراً فَجَعَلَهُ نَسَباً وَصِهْراً وَكَانَ رَبُّكَ قَدِيراً,And He it is Who created man from water He created from a sperm-drop a human being and made for him ties of blood and ties of marriage whether it be a male or a female they marry for the purposes of procreation. For your Lord is ever Powerful with the power to do whatever He will.
وَيَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ مَا لاَ يَنفَعُهُمْ وَلاَ يَضُرُّهُمْ وَكَانَ ٱلْكَافِرُ عَلَىٰ رَبِّهِ ظَهِيراً,And they the disbelievers worship besides God that which neither benefits them when they worship it nor harms them should they refrain therefrom — and these are idols; and the disbeliever is ever a partisan against his Lord an assistant to Satan through his obedience to him.
وَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَاكَ إِلاَّ مُبَشِّراً وَنَذِيراً,And We have not sent you except as a bearer of good tidings of Paradise and as a warner a threatener of people with the chastisement of the Fire.
قُلْ مَآ أَسْأَلُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ مِنْ أَجْرٍ إِلاَّ مَن شَآءَ أَن يَتَّخِذَ إِلَىٰ رَبِّهِ سَبِيلاً,Say ‘I do not ask of you in return for this that is for delivering that Message with which I have been sent any reward except that whoever wishes to follow a way to his Lord should do so’ by expending his wealth for the sake of attaining God’s pleasure exalted be He; then whoever wishes to do so I will not prevent him from doing so.
وَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى ٱلْحَيِّ ٱلَّذِي لاَ يَمُوتُ وَسَبِّحْ بِحَمْدِهِ وَكَفَىٰ بِهِ بِذُنُوبِ عِبَادِهِ خَبِيراً,And put your trust in the Living One Who does not die and make glorifications ensconced in His praise in other words say subhāna’Llāhi wa’l-hamdu li’Llāh ‘Glory be to God and praise be to God’. And He suffices as One Aware as Knower of the sins of His servants khabīran ‘One Aware’ is semantically connected to bi-dhunūbi ‘of the sins’.
ٱلَّذِي خَلَقَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضَ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا فِي سِتَّةِ أَيَّامٍ ثُمَّ ٱسْتَوَىٰ عَلَى ٱلْعَرْشِ ٱلرَّحْمَـٰنُ فَسْئَلْ بِهِ خَبِيراً,He it is Who created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in six days of the length of the days of this world since there was no sun at that point — had He willed He could have created them in an instant but His not having done so is because He will to teach His creatures to be circumspect — then presided upon the Throne al-‘arsh in the classical language is the seat on which a king sits the Compassionate One al-rahmānu substitutes for the subject of the verb istawā ‘presided’ a presiding befitting of Him; so ask O man about Him about the Compassionate One anyone who is well aware to inform you about His attributes!
وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمُ ٱسْجُدُواْ لِلرَّحْمَـٰنِ قَالُواْ وَمَا ٱلرَّحْمَـٰنُ أَنَسْجُدُ لِمَا تَأْمُرُنَا وَزَادَهُمْ نُفُوراً,And when it is said to them to the disbelievers of Mecca ‘Prostrate yourselves before the Compassionate One’ they say ‘And what is the Compassionate One? Should we prostrate ourselves to whatever you bid us’ ta’murunā; or read ya’murunā ‘whatever he bids us’ — in both cases the one bidding is Muhammad (s) — when we do not know who He is? No! And it this that is said to them increases their aversion to faith.

قَالَ رَبِّ إِنِّيۤ أَخَافُ أَن يُكَذِّبُونِ,He Moses said ‘My Lord I fear they will deny me
وَيَضِيقُ صَدْرِي وَلاَ يَنطَلِقُ لِسَانِي فَأَرْسِلْ إِلَىٰ هَارُونَ,and that anguish will constrain my breast because of their denial of me and that my tongue will not utter clearly to deliver the Message because of the knot in it. So give the Mission to my brother Aaron alongside me.
وَلَهُمْ عَلَيَّ ذَنبٌ فَأَخَافُ أَن يَقْتُلُونِ,And I have sinned against them by my slaying of the Egyptian man and I fear they will slay me’ for this.
قَالَ كَلاَّ فَٱذْهَبَا بِآيَاتِنَآ إِنَّا مَعَكُمْ مُّسْتَمِعُونَ,Said He exalted be He ‘Certainly not! they shall not slay you. Go both of you you and your brother — this address although in the dual form is predominantly for the person present as opposed to the absent one — with Our signs. We will indeed be with you hearing what you say and what is said to you ma‘akum the two Moses and Aaron are referred to here with the plural pronoun.
فَأْتِيَا فِرْعَوْنَ فَقُولاۤ إِنَّا رَسُولُ رَبِّ ٱلْعَالَمِينَ,So the two of you approach Pharaoh and say “Indeed We are — indeed each of the two of us is the Messenger of the Lord of the Worlds to you
أَنْ أَرْسِلْ مَعَنَا بَنِيۤ إِسْرَائِيلَ,that you should let go forth with us to Syria the Children of Israel” ’. So they approached him and said to him that which has been mentioned.
قَالَ أَلَمْ نُرَبِّكَ فِينَا وَلِيداً وَلَبِثْتَ فِينَا مِنْ عُمُرِكَ سِنِينَ,He Pharaoh said to Moses ‘Did we not rear you among us in our homes as a child? as an infant only recently born but weaned and did you not stay with us for years of your life? for thirty years — he would dress from Pharaoh’s clothes and ride chariots of his and was referred to as Pharaoh’s son.
وَفَعَلْتَ فَعْلَتَكَ ٱلَّتِي فَعَلْتَ وَأَنتَ مِنَ ٱلْكَافِرِينَ,And you committed that deed of yours — namely his slaying of the Egyptian — being an ingrate’ a denier of my favours to you in having reared you among us and not enslaved you.
قَالَ فَعَلْتُهَآ إِذاً وَأَنَاْ مِنَ ٱلضَّالِّينَ,He Moses said ‘I did that then when I was astray from the knowledge and the Message which God would later give me.
فَفَرَرْتُ مِنكُمْ لَمَّا خِفْتُكُمْ فَوَهَبَ لِي رَبِّي حُكْماً وَجَعَلَنِي مِنَ ٱلْمُرْسَلِينَ,So I fled from you as I was afraid of you. Then my Lord gave me judgement knowledge and made me one of the messengers.
وَتِلْكَ نِعْمَةٌ تَمُنُّهَا عَلَيَّ أَنْ عَبَّدتَّ بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ,That is a favour with which you now reproach me that you have enslaved the Children of Israel’ an ‘abbadta banī Isrā’īl is explicative of tilka ‘that’ in other words you have enslaved them but not me there is no favour in that for your enslavement of them is wrong some scholars have reckoned there to be an interrogative hamza of denial at the beginning of this verse a-tilka ni‘matun ‘is that a favour?’.
قَالَ فِرْعَوْنُ وَمَا رَبُّ ٱلْعَالَمِينَ,Pharaoh said to Moses ‘And what is “the Lord of the Worlds” ’ the One Whose Messenger you say you indeed are? In other words what exactly is He? And since there is no way for creation to know the true nature of God but only to know Him through an articulation of His attributes Moses blessings and peace be upon him responds to him with mention of some of these attributes
قَالَ رَبُّ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَآ إِن كُنتُمْ مُّوقِنِينَ,He said ‘The Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in other words the Creator of all that — should you have conviction’ that He exalted be He is their Creator then believe in Him alone.
قَالَ لِمَنْ حَوْلَهُ أَلاَ تَسْتَمِعُونَ,He Pharaoh said to those noblemen among his folk who were around him ‘Did you not hear?!’ his response how it does not correspond to the question I asked?
قَالَ رَبُّكُمْ وَرَبُّ آبَآئِكُمُ ٱلأَوَّلِينَ,He Moses said ‘Your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers’. Now even though this fact is comprised by what was said before it enrages Pharaoh and therefore
قَالَ إِنَّ رَسُولَكُمُ ٱلَّذِيۤ أُرْسِلَ إِلَيْكُمْ لَمَجْنُونٌ,He said ‘Verily this messenger of yours sent to you is a madman!’
قَالَ رَبُّ ٱلْمَشْرِقِ وَٱلْمَغْرِبِ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَآ إِن كُنتُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ,He Moses said ‘The Lord of the east and the west and all that is between them — should you comprehend’ that He is such a Lord then believe in Him alone.
قَالَ لَئِنِ ٱتَّخَذْتَ إِلَـٰهَاً غَيْرِي لأَجْعَلَنَّكَ مِنَ ٱلْمَسْجُونِينَ,He Pharaoh said to Moses ‘If you choose any god other than me I will surely make you a prisoner!’. His Pharaoh’s prison was very harsh for a person would be shut up in a dungeon underground alone where he could neither see nor hear anyone else.
قَالَ أَوَلَوْ جِئْتُكَ بِشَيءٍ مُّبِينٍ,He Moses said to him ‘What would you do this even if I bring you something manifest?’ patent proof of my Mission?
قَالَ فَأْتِ بِهِ إِن كُنتَ مِنَ ٱلصَّادِقِينَ,He Pharaoh said to him ‘Then bring it if you are truthful’ in this.
فَأَلْقَىٰ عَصَاهُ فَإِذَا هِيَ ثُعْبَانٌ مُّبِينٌ,So he threw down his staff and lo! it was a manifest serpent a great snake.
وَنَزَعَ يَدَهُ فَإِذَا هِيَ بَيْضَآءُ لِلنَّاظِرِينَ,Then he drew out his hand he brought it out of his pocket and lo! it was white glowing before the onlookers and not its usual skin colour.
قَالَ لِلْمَلإِ حَوْلَهُ إِنَّ هَـٰذَا لَسَاحِرٌ عَلِيمٌ,He Pharaoh said to the council around him ‘Surely this man is a cunning sorcerer an expert in the art of magic
يُرِيدُ أَن يُخْرِجَكُمْ مِّنْ أَرْضِكُمْ بِسِحْرِهِ فَمَاذَا تَأْمُرُونَ,who seeks to expel you from your land by his sorcery. So what do you advise?’
قَالُوۤاْ أَرْجِهْ وَأَخَاهُ وَٱبْعَثْ فِي ٱلْمَدَآئِنِ حَاشِرِينَ,They said ‘Put him and his brother off for a while postpone judgement of their affair and send musterers into the cities
يَأْتُوكَ بِكُلِّ سَحَّارٍ عَلِيمٍ,to bring you every cunning sorcerer’ to surpass Moses in the art of magic.
فَجُمِعَ ٱلسَّحَرَةُ لِمِيقَاتِ يَوْمٍ مَّعْلُومٍ,So the sorcerers were assembled at a fixed time of a known day which was the morning of the Festival Day.
وَقِيلَ لِلنَّاسِ هَلْ أَنتُمْ مُّجْتَمِعُونَ,And it was said to the people ‘Will you assemble!’
لَعَلَّنَا نَتَّبِعُ ٱلسَّحَرَةَ إِن كَانُواْ هُمُ ٱلْغَالِبِينَ,Maybe we will follow the sorcerers should they be the victors’ the interrogative of the previous verse is an incitement to assemble and the optative sense implicit in la‘alla is due to their anticipation of victory and hence their continued adherence to their religion and rejection of Moses.
فَلَمَّا جَآءَ ٱلسَّحَرَةُ قَالُواْ لِفِرْعَوْنَ أَإِنَّ لَنَا لأَجْراً إِن كُنَّا نَحْنُ ٱلْغَالِبِينَ,So when the sorcerers came they said to Pharaoh ‘Shall we indeed read a-inna either by pronouncing both hamzas or by not pronouncing the second but in both cases inserting an alif have a reward if we were to be the victors?’
قَالَ نَعَمْ وَإِنَّكُمْ إِذاً لَّمِنَ ٱلْمُقَرَّبِينَ,He said ‘Yes of course! And you shall then be among those closest to me’.
قَالَ لَهُمْ مُّوسَىٰ أَلْقُواْ مَآ أَنتُمْ مُّلْقُونَ,Moses said to them after they had said to him Either you cast or we shall be the casters Q. 7115 ‘Cast what you have to cast’ — the command to do this signifies an authorisation for them to cast and a means whereby the truth will be made to prevail.
فَأَلْقَوْاْ حِبَالَهُمْ وَعِصِيَّهُمْ وَقَالُواْ بِعِزَّةِ فِرْعَونَ إِنَّا لَنَحْنُ ٱلْغَالِبُونَ,So they cast their ropes and their staffs and said ‘By the power of Pharaoh we shall surely be the victors!’
فَأَلْقَىٰ مُوسَىٰ عَصَاهُ فَإِذَا هِيَ تَلْقَفُ مَا يَأْفِكُونَ,Thereat Moses cast his staff and lo! it was swallowing talqafu one of the original two tā’ letters of taltaqifu has been assimilated what they had faked what they had transformed through illusion making their ropes and staffs appear to be moving serpents.
فَأُلْقِيَ ٱلسَّحَرَةُ سَاجِدِينَ,So the sorcerers fell down prostrating.
قَالُواْ آمَنَّا بِرَبِّ ٱلْعَالَمِينَ,They said ‘We believe in the Lord of the Worlds
رَبِّ مُوسَىٰ وَهَارُونَ,the Lord of Moses and Aaron’ for they realised that what they had witnessed in the case of the staff could not have been the result of mere sorcery.
قَالَ آمَنتُمْ لَهُ قَبْلَ أَنْ آذَنَ لَكُمْ إِنَّهُ لَكَبِيرُكُمُ ٱلَّذِي عَلَّمَكُمُ ٱلسِّحْرَ فَلَسَوْفَ تَعْلَمُونَ لأُقَطِّعَنَّ أَيْدِيَكُمْ وَأَرْجُلَكُمْ مِّنْ خِلاَفٍ وَلأُصَلِّبَنَّكُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ,Pharaoh said ‘Do you believe a-āmantum read pronouncing both hamzas or replacing the second one with an alif him Moses though I have not given you leave? He is indeed your chief the one who has taught you sorcery — so that he only taught you some tricks and then surpassed you with others. Soon you will know what I will do with you! I will assuredly cut off your hands and legs on opposite sides — in other words the right hand of each one together with his left leg — then I shall surely crucify you all.’
قَالُواْ لاَ ضَيْرَ إِنَّآ إِلَىٰ رَبِّنَا مُنقَلِبُونَ,They said ‘There is no harm in that no damage will be done to us thereby. Surely to our Lord after we die whichever way that may be we shall return in the Hereafter.
إِنَّا نَطْمَعُ أَن يَغْفِرَ لَنَا رَبُّنَا خَطَايَانَآ أَن كُنَّآ أَوَّلَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,Indeed We hope our Lord will forgive us our iniquities for being the first to believe’ in our time.
وَأَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَىٰ مُوسَىٰ أَنْ أَسْرِ بِعِبَادِيۤ إِنَّكُم مّتَّبَعُونَ,And We revealed to Moses after many years which he spent among them calling them to the truth with God’s signs but all of which only increased them in insolence saying ‘Journey with My servants the Children of Israel by night a variant reading for an asri is an isr from the verb sarā one form of asrā go with them by night in the direction of the sea for indeed you will be pursued’. Pharaoh and his armies will pursue you but when they enter the sea in pursuit of you I will deliver you and drown them.
فَأَرْسَلَ فِرْعَونُ فِي ٱلْمَدَآئِنِ حَاشِرِينَ,Then Pharaoh having been informed of their night departure sent to the cities — it is said that he ruled a thousand cities and twelve thousand villages — musterers to assemble the army saying
إِنَّ هَـٰؤُلاۤءِ لَشِرْذِمَةٌ قَلِيلُونَ,‘Lo! these are but a small gang. It is said that they the Children of Israel numbered 670000 while his Pharaoh’s vanguard alone numbered 700000 and so he deemed their number insignificant in comparison to his huge army.
وَإِنَّهُمْ لَنَا لَغَآئِظُونَ,And indeed they have enraged us their actions infuriate us
وَإِنَّا لَجَمِيعٌ حَاذِرُونَ,and indeed we are all on our guard’ ready a variant reading for hadhirūna has hādhirūn meaning ‘alert’.
فَأَخْرَجْنَاهُمْ مِّن جَنَّاتٍ وَعُيُونٍ,God exalted be He says So We made them Pharaoh and his folk go forth out of Egypt in order to pursue Moses and his people from gardens orchards on either side of the Nile and springs streams running from the Nile through their dwellings
وَكُنُوزٍ وَمَقَامٍ كَرِيمٍ,and treasures visible riches of gold and silver — these riches are called kunūz as opposed to amwāl ‘riches’ because that portion which is always due to God exalted be He from them had not been paid — and splendid places exquisite residences for princes and ministers surrounded by their retinues.
كَذَلِكَ وَأَوْرَثْنَاهَا بَنِيۤ إِسْرَائِيلَ,So it was that is Our expulsion of them was as We have described and We made the Children of Israel to inherit these after drowning Pharaoh and his folk.
فَأَتْبَعُوهُم مُّشْرِقِينَ,Then they pursued them they caught them up at sunrise.
فَلَمَّا تَرَاءَى ٱلْجَمْعَانِ قَالَ أَصْحَابُ مُوسَىٰ إِنَّا لَمُدْرَكُونَ,And when the two hosts sighted each other the companions of Moses said ‘We have been caught!’ Pharaoh’s hosts have caught us up and we have no power against them.
قَالَ كَلاَّ إِنَّ مَعِيَ رَبِّي سَيَهْدِينِ,He Moses said ‘Certainly not! they shall not catch us up; indeed I have my Lord with me to provide assistance. He will guide me’ to the route of deliverance.
فَأَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَىٰ مُوسَىٰ أَنِ ٱضْرِب بِّعَصَاكَ ٱلْبَحْرَ فَٱنفَلَقَ فَكَانَ كُلُّ فِرْقٍ كَٱلطَّوْدِ ٱلْعَظِيمِ,God exalted be He says Thereupon We revealed to Moses ‘Strike the sea with your staff’ and he struck it whereupon it parted it split into twelve parts and each part was as a mighty mountain between each of these parts were paths which they followed such that not even the saddles or the felts of the riders were touched by water.
وَأَزْلَفْنَا ثَمَّ ٱلآخَرِينَ,And there We brought near the others Pharaoh and his folk until they followed them across the same paths.
وَأَنجَيْنَا مُوسَىٰ وَمَن مَّعَهُ أَجْمَعِينَ,And We delivered Moses and all those who were with him by bringing them out of the sea while it was in the state mentioned above.
ثُمَّ أَغْرَقْنَا ٱلآخَرِينَ,Then We drowned the others Pharaoh and his folk by closing the sea on them after they had entered the sea and the Children of Israel had exited therefrom.
إِنَّ فِي ذَلِكَ لآيَةً وَمَا كَانَ أَكْثَرُهُم مُّؤْمِنِينَ,Surely in that drowning of Pharaoh and his folk there is a sign a lesson for those generations who would come after them; but most of them are not believers in God. The only ones to believe were Āsiya — Pharaoh’s wife — Hizqīl the believing man of Pharaoh’s family and Maryam daughter of Nāmūsī she who pointed out the bone remains of the prophet Joseph peace be upon him.
وَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَهُوَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلرَّحِيمُ,And surely your Lord He is the Mighty for He wrought vengeance upon the disbelievers by drowning them the Merciful to believers delivering them from drowning.

أَوْ يَنفَعُونَكُمْ أَوْ يَضُرُّونَ,Or do they bring you benefit when you worship them or harm? to you if you do not?

إِلاَّ مَنْ أَتَى ٱللَّهَ بِقَلْبٍ سَلِيمٍ,except him who comes to God with a heart that is sound free from idolatry and hypocrisy — and this is the heart of the believer whom such things will avail.
وَأُزْلِفَتِ ٱلْجَنَّةُ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ,And Paradise will be brought near for the God-fearing and they will be able to see it
وَبُرِّزَتِ ٱلْجَحِيمُ لِلْغَاوِينَ,and Hell will be revealed plainly for the perverse the disbelievers.

وَإِنَّهُ لَتَنزِيلُ رَبِّ ٱلْعَالَمِينَ,Truly it the Qur’ān is the revelation of the Lord of the Worlds
نَزَلَ بِهِ ٱلرُّوحُ ٱلأَمِينُ,brought down by the Trustworthy Spirit Gabriel
عَلَىٰ قَلْبِكَ لِتَكُونَ مِنَ ٱلْمُنْذِرِينَ,upon your heart that you may be one of the warners
بِلِسَانٍ عَرَبِيٍّ مُّبِينٍ,in a clear Arabic tongue a variant reading for nazala ‘he brought down’ verse 193 has nuzzila ‘was sent down’ and al-rūha ‘the Spirit’ in the accusative the subject of the verb being God.
وَإِنَّهُ لَفِي زُبُرِ ٱلأَوَّلِينَ,And truly it the allusion to the Qur’ān that would be revealed to Muhammad (s) is in the Scriptures the Books of the ancients such as the Torah and the Gospel.
أَوَ لَمْ يَكُن لَّهُمْ آيَةً أَن يَعْلَمَهُ عُلَمَاءُ بَنِيۤ إِسْرَائِيلَ,Is it not a sign of this fact for them for the disbelievers of Mecca that the learned of the Children of Israel recognise it? those such as ‘Abd Allāh b. Salām and his companions from among those who became Muslim believers they are able inform you of this read yakun with āyatan in the accusative or takun with āyatun in the nominative.
وَلَوْ نَزَّلْنَاهُ عَلَىٰ بَعْضِ ٱلأَعْجَمِينَ,For had We revealed it to some non-Arabs a‘jamūn is the plural of a‘jam
فَقَرَأَهُ عَلَيْهِم مَّا كَانُوا بِهِ مُؤْمِنِينَ,and had he recited it to them that is to the disbelievers of Mecca they would not have believed in it disdaining to follow it.
كَذَلِكَ سَلَكْنَاهُ فِي قُلُوبِ ٱلْمُجْرِمِينَ,So in the same way in which We would have caused denial of it to penetrate the hearts of disbelievers had it been recited by a non-Arab We have caused denial of it to penetrate the hearts of the criminals the Meccan disbelievers when Muhammad (s) recites it.
لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِهِ حَتَّىٰ يَرَوُاْ ٱلْعَذَابَ ٱلأَلِيمَ,They will not believe in it until they behold the painful chastisement
فَيَأْتِيَهُم بَغْتَةً وَهُمْ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ,so that it will come upon them suddenly while they are not aware.
فَيَقُولُواْ هَلْ نَحْنُ مُنظَرُونَ,Thereupon they will say ‘Shall we be granted any respite?’ that we might become believers?; and it shall be said to them ‘No!’ and they will say ‘When will this chastisement be?’ God exalted be He says
أَفَبِعَذَابِنَا يَسْتَعْجِلُونَ,So do they seek to hasten Our chastisement?
أَفَرَأَيْتَ إِن مَّتَّعْنَاهُمْ سِنِينَ,Consider this then — inform Me If We were to let them enjoy life for many years
ثُمَّ جَآءَهُم مَّا كَانُواْ يُوعَدُونَ,then there were to come on them that which they have been promised of chastisement
مَآ أَغْنَىٰ عَنْهُمْ مَّا كَانُواْ يُمَتَّعُونَ,in what way mā here is interrogative would that enjoyment which they were given avail them? in averting the chastisement or mitigating it? It would be of no avail!
وَمَآ أَهْلَكْنَا مِن قَرْيَةٍ إِلاَّ لَهَا مُنذِرُونَ,And We have not destroyed any town but it had warners messengers to warn its inhabitants;
ذِكْرَىٰ وَمَا كُنَّا ظَالِمِينَ,as a reminder an admonition for them; for We were never unjust for We destroy them only after they have been warned. The following was revealed to refute what the idolaters were saying
وَمَا تَنَزَّلَتْ بِهِ ٱلشَّيَاطِينُ,It the Qur’ān has not been brought down by the devils.
وَمَا يَنبَغِي لَهُمْ وَمَا يَسْتَطِيعُونَ,Neither would it behove befit them to bring it down nor are they capable of doing that.
إِنَّهُمْ عَنِ ٱلسَّمْعِ لَمَعْزُولُونَ,Truly they are barred restrained with blazing stars from the hearing of the sayings of the angels.
فَلاَ تَدْعُ مَعَ ٱللَّهِ إِلَـٰهاً آخَرَ فَتَكُونَ مِنَ ٱلْمُعَذَّبِينَ,So do not invoke any other god with God lest you be among the chastised — if you were to do what they call you to.
وَأَنذِرْ عَشِيرَتَكَ ٱلأَقْرَبِينَ,And warn the nearest of your kinsfolk namely the Banū Hāshim and the Banū al-Muttalib ‘He the Prophet warned them publicly …’ as reported by al-Bukhārī and Muslim.
وَٱخْفِضْ جَنَاحَكَ لِمَنِ ٱتَّبَعَكَ مِنَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,And lower your wing show your gentle side to the believers the affirmers of God’s Oneness who follow you.
فَإِنْ عَصَوْكَ فَقُلْ إِنِّي بَرِيۤءٌ مِّمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ,But if they your kinsfolk disobey you say to them ‘I am absolved of what you do’ in worshipping gods other than God.
وَتَوكَّلْ عَلَى ٱلْعَزِيزِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ,And put your trust wa-tawakkal or read fa-tawakkal ‘then put your trust’ in the Mighty the Merciful God in other words entrust Him with all your affairs
ٱلَّذِي يَرَاكَ حِينَ تَقُومُ,Who sees you when you stand for prayer
وَتَقَلُّبَكَ فِي ٱلسَّاجِدِينَ,and your movements — in performing the various parts of prayer standing sitting bowing and prostrating — among those who prostrate those who perform the prayers.
إِنَّهُ هُوَ ٱلسَّمِيعُ ٱلْعَلِيمُ,Truly He is the Hearing the Knowing.
هَلْ أُنَبِّئُكُمْ عَلَىٰ مَن تَنَزَّلُ ٱلشَّيَاطِينُ,Shall I inform you O disbelievers of Mecca upon whom the devils descend? tanazzalu one of the tā’ letters in the original tatanazzalu has been omitted.
تَنَزَّلُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ أَفَّاكٍ أَثِيمٍ,They descend upon every sinful profligate liar such as Musaylama and other soothsayers.
يُلْقُونَ ٱلسَّمْعَ وَأَكْثَرُهُمْ كَاذِبُونَ,They the devils report the heard sayings what they hear from the angels they report to the soothsayers but most of them are liars adding much that is false to what they hear — this was revealed before the devils were barred from the heaven.
وَٱلشُّعَرَآءُ يَتَّبِعُهُمُ ٱلْغَاوُونَ,As for the poets only the perverse follow them in their poetry propounding it and reciting it on their behalf to others; they are thus reprehensible.
أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّهُمْ فِي كُلِّ وَادٍ يَهِيمُونَ,Have you not noticed that — are you not aware that — in every valley of the valleys of rhetoric and the art thereof they rove overstepping the bounds of decency in their eulogies and diatribes
وَأَنَّهُمْ يَقُولُونَ مَا لاَ يَفْعَلُونَ,and that they say we do what they do not do? in other words that they lie.
إِلاَّ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ وَذَكَرُواْ ٱللَّهَ كَثِيراً وَٱنتَصَرُواْ مِن بَعْدِ مَا ظُلِمُواْ وَسَيَعْلَمْ ٱلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوۤاْ أَيَّ مُنقَلَبٍ يَنقَلِبُونَ,Save those poets who believe and perform righteous deeds and remember God frequently in other words those whom poetry does not distract from the remembrance of God and vindicate themselves by lampooning the disbelievers after they have been wronged by the disbelievers’ reviling of them as belonging together with all believers — such individuals are not reprehensible. God exalted be He says God does not like the utterance of evil words out loud unless a person has been wronged Q. 4148; He exalted be He also says so whoever commits aggression against you commit aggression against him in the manner that he committed against you Q. 2194; and those poets and others who are wrongdoers will soon know the reversal the return with which they will meet by which they will return after death.
طسۤ تِلْكَ آيَاتُ ٱلْقُرْآنِ وَكِتَابٍ مُّبِينٍ,Tā sīn God knows best what He means by these letters. Those namely these signs are the signs of the Qur’ān signs from it and a Manifest Book manifesting what is truth from what is falsehood wa-kitābin ‘Book’ is a supplement to al-qur’ān with the addition of an adjective mubīn ‘manifest’.
هُدًى وَبُشْرَىٰ لِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,It is a guidance guiding from error and good tidings for the believers who believe in it of Paradise;
ٱلَّذِينَ يُقِيمُونَ ٱلصَّلاَةَ وَيُؤْتُونَ ٱلزَّكَاةَ وَهُم بِٱلآخِرَةِ هُمْ يُوقِنُونَ,those who observe prayer performing it in the way that it should be performed and give alms and who are certain of the Hereafter knowing it to be true through the many proofs thereof hum ‘they’ is repeated because a separation has taken place between it the first hum and the predicate yūqinūna.
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱلآخِرَةِ زَيَّنَّا لَهُمْ أَعْمَالَهُمْ فَهُمْ يَعْمَهُونَ,Truly those who do not believe in the Hereafter We have adorned their vile deeds for them by making such deeds seem sensuous so that they then deem them wholesome and so they are bewildered confused about why We deem these deeds to be vile.
أُوْلَـٰئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ لَهُمْ سُوۤءُ ٱلْعَذَابِ وَهُمْ فِي ٱلآخِرَةِ هُمُ ٱلأَخْسَرُونَ,Those are they for whom there is an awful chastisement the worst chastisement in this world being killed or being taken captive; and in the Hereafter they will be the greatest losers because they will end up in the Fire which has been made everlasting for them.
وَإِنَّكَ لَتُلَقَّى ٱلْقُرْآنَ مِن لَّدُنْ حَكِيمٍ عَلِيمٍ,And truly you — this is an address to the Prophet s — are receiving the Qur’ān it is being transmitted to you intensely from One Wise Knowing in such transmission.
إِذْ قَالَ مُوسَىٰ لأَهْلِهِ إِنِّيۤ آنَسْتُ نَاراً سَآتِيكُمْ مِّنْهَا بِخَبَرٍ أَوْ آتِيكُمْ بِشِهَابٍ قَبَسٍ لَّعَلَّكُمْ تَصْطَلُونَ,Mention when Moses said to his family to his wife during his journey from Midian back to Egypt ‘Assuredly I notice I see in the distance a fire. I will bring you news from there about the journey’s route — for he had lost his way — or bring you a firebrand read as a genitive annexation bi-shihābi qabasin as an explication of shihāb ‘flame’; or read without annexation bi-shihābin qabasin meaning a flame of fire at the end of a wick or a wooden stick that perhaps you might warm yourselves’ tastalūn the tā’ replaces the tā’ of the 8th verbal form ifta‘ala sc. istalā; it derives from salaya or saliya ‘to be exposed to the blaze of fire’ that perhaps you might warm yourselves from the cold.
فَلَمَّا جَآءَهَا نُودِيَ أَن بُورِكَ مَن فِي ٱلنَّارِ وَمَنْ حَوْلَهَا وَسُبْحَانَ ٱللَّهِ رَبِّ ٱلْعَالَمِينَ,But when he reached it he was called with the following words ‘Blessed is he that is to say God bless him who is in the fire namely Moses and who is around it namely the angels — or vice-versa the verb bāraka may be followed immediately by the direct object or by a preposition and then the direct object; a noun such as makān ‘location’ is implied after fī ‘in’ sc. man fī makāni’l-nār ‘who is in the area of the fire’; and Glory be to God the Lord of the Worlds — this is included in the call and is meant to declare that God is above all evil associations.
يٰمُوسَىٰ إِنَّهُ أَنَا ٱللَّهُ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ,O Moses lo! in other words the fact is that it is I God the Mighty the Wise.
وَأَلْقِ عَصَاكَ فَلَمَّا رَآهَا تَهْتَزُّ كَأَنَّهَا جَآنٌّ وَلَّىٰ مُدْبِراً وَلَمْ يُعَقِّبْ يٰمُوسَىٰ لاَ تَخَفْ إِنِّي لاَ يَخَافُ لَدَيَّ ٱلْمُرْسَلُونَ,Throw down your staff’ and he threw it down. And when he saw it wriggling moving like a serpent a slender snake he turned his back in flight and did not come back. God exalted be He says ‘O Moses do not fear it. Surely in My presence before Me the messengers do not fear any snake or otherwise
إِلاَّ مَن ظَلَمَ ثُمَّ بَدَّلَ حُسْناً بَعْدَ سُوۤءٍ فَإِنِّي غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,except him who has wronged his soul but then changed his wrong for good — he then performs good deeds — after having done evil in other words he has repented then truly I am Forgiving Merciful I will accept his repentance and forgive him.
وَأَدْخِلْ يَدَكَ فِي جَيْبِكَ تَخْرُجْ بَيْضَآءَ مِنْ غَيْرِ سُوۤءٍ فِي تِسْعِ آيَاتٍ إِلَىٰ فِرْعَوْنَ وَقَوْمِهِ إِنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ قَوْماً فَاسِقِينَ,And insert your hand into your bosom into the collar of your shirt and it will emerge not in its usual skin colour but white without any blemish any vestige of leprosy with a glare that dazzles the eyes as one sign among nine signs with which you shall be sent as God’s messenger to Pharaoh and his folk; indeed they are an immoral lot’.
فَلَمَّا جَآءَتْهُمْ آيَاتُنَا مُبْصِرَةً قَالُواْ هَـٰذَا سِحْرٌ مُّبِينٌ,But when Our signs came to them plain to see illuminating and clear they said ‘This is manifest sorcery’ clear and evident sorcery.
وَجَحَدُواْ بِهَا وَٱسْتَيْقَنَتْهَآ أَنفُسُهُمْ ظُلْماً وَعُلُوّاً فَٱنْظُرْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَاقِبَةُ ٱلْمُفْسِدِينَ,And they denied them they did not affirm them though in reality their souls had been convinced in other words though they were certain that these signs were from God wrongfully and arrogantly in defiance of believing in what Moses had brought these two adverbs refer back to the cause of their denial. So behold O Muhammad (s) how was the sequel for the agents of corruption a sequel which you know they were destroyed.
وَلَقَدْ آتَيْنَا دَاوُودَ وَسُلَيْمَانَ عِلْماً وَقَالاَ ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ ٱلَّذِي فَضَّلَنَا عَلَىٰ كَثِيرٍ مِّنْ عِبَادِهِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,And verily We gave David and Solomon his son knowledge of rendering decisive judgement between people and knowledge of the speech of birds and of other things and they said giving thanks to God ‘Praise be to God Who has favoured us with prophethood and the disposal of jinn humans and devils to our service over many of His believing servants’.
وَوَرِثَ سُلَيْمَانُ دَاوُودَ وَقَالَ يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّاسُ عُلِّمْنَا مَنطِقَ ٱلطَّيْرِ وَأُوتِينَا مِن كُلِّ شَيْءٍ إِنَّ هَـٰذَا لَهُوَ ٱلْفَضْلُ ٱلْمُبِينُ,And Solomon inherited from David prophethood and knowledge exclusively from among all his other children; and he said ‘O people we have been taught the speech of the birds that is the ability to understand their sounds and we have been given of all things given to prophets and kings. Indeed this gift is the manifest the evident favour’.
وَحُشِرَ لِسْلَيْمَانَ جُنُودُهُ مِنَ ٱلْجِنِّ وَٱلإِنْس وَٱلطَّيْرِ فَهُمْ يُوزَعُونَ,And on one journey Solomon’s hosts of jinn and humans and birds stood assembled for him as they were being arrayed brought together in groups and marshalled.
حَتَّىٰ إِذَآ أَتَوْا عَلَىٰ وَادِ ٱلنَّمْلِ قَالَتْ نَمْلَةٌ يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّمْلُ ٱدْخُلُواْ مَسَاكِنَكُمْ لاَ يَحْطِمَنَّكُمْ سُلَيْمَانُ وَجُنُودُهُ وَهُمْ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ,When they came to the Valley of the Ants — which is located either in Tā’if or in Syria and whose ants are either small or large — an ant the queen ant who had seen Solomon’s hosts said ‘O ants enter your dwellings lest Solomon and his hosts crush you while they are unaware!’ — the ants are likened to rational beings in their use of the latter’s speech.
فَتَبَسَّمَ ضَاحِكاً مِّن قَوْلِهَا وَقَالَ رَبِّ أَوْزِعْنِيۤ أَنْ أَشْكُرَ نِعْمَتَكَ ٱلَّتِيۤ أَنْعَمْتَ عَلَيَّ وَعَلَىٰ وَالِدَيَّ وَأَنْ أَعْمَلَ صَالِحاً تَرْضَاهُ وَأَدْخِلْنِي بِرَحْمَتِكَ فِي عِبَادِكَ ٱلصَّالِحِينَ,Whereat he Solomon smiled fa-tabassama the beginning of the sentence amused dāhikan the end of the sentence at its words which he had heard from three miles away and which was carried to him by the winds. When he was on the verge of entering their valley he Solomon made his hosts halt until they the ants had entered their dwellings — on this journey his hosts consisted of cavalry and infantry. And he said ‘My Lord inspire me to be thankful for Your grace with which You have favoured me and my parents and to do good that will please You and include me by Your mercy among Your righteous servants’ the prophets and saints.
وَتَفَقَّدَ ٱلطَّيْرَ فَقَالَ مَالِيَ لاَ أَرَى ٱلْهُدْهُدَ أَمْ كَانَ مِنَ ٱلْغَآئِبِينَ,And he reviewed the birds to see the hoopoe — which would locate water beneath the ground and indicate its location by pecking at it whereupon the devils would extract it for Solomon required it for when he prayed; but he could not see him — then he said ‘Why is it that I do not see the hoopoe? in other words is there something preventing me from seeing him? Or is he among the absent? and so I cannot see him because he is absent?’ And when he became certain of the hoopoe’s absence
لأُعَذِّبَنَّهُ عَذَاباً شَدِيداً أَوْ لأَاْذبَحَنَّهُ أَوْ لَيَأْتِيَنِّي بِسُلْطَانٍ مُّبِينٍ,He said ‘Assuredly I will chastise him with a severe chastisement by having all his feathers as well as his tail plucked and leaving him out in the sun where he would not be able to escape from reptiles or I will slaughter him by slitting his throat unless he brings me read la-ya’tiyannī or la-ya’tinannī a clear warrant’ plain manifest proof for his having a valid excuse.
فَمَكَثَ غَيْرَ بَعِيدٍ فَقَالَ أَحَطتُ بِمَا لَمْ تُحِطْ بِهِ وَجِئْتُكَ مِن سَبَإٍ بِنَبَإٍ يَقِينٍ,But he did not remain read fa-makutha or fa-makatha long in absence in other words he was away only for a short while and came to Solomon humbly with his head up and his wings and tail lowered. Solomon pardoned him and asked him about what he had encountered during his absence and he said ‘I have discovered something of which you have no knowledge and I have brought you from Sheba this may be read in declined form min Saba’in or left as indeclinable min Saba’a — a tribe in Yemen whose name is taken from the name of one of their ancestors which is also the reason why it may be declined — a verified report.
إِنِّي وَجَدتُّ ٱمْرَأَةً تَمْلِكُهُمْ وَأُوتِيَتْ مِن كُلِّ شَيْءٍ وَلَهَا عَرْشٌ عَظِيمٌ,I found a woman ruling over them in other words she was their queen her name Bilqīs; and she has been given an abundance of all things that kings might require in the way of machines and instruments and she possesses a great throne — its length was 80 cubits its width 40 cubits its height 30 cubits and was made of gold and silver encrusted with pearls rubies chrysolite and emeralds with its legs made of rubies chrysolite and emeralds containing seven inner doors the door of each chamber shut.
وَجَدتُّهَا وَقَوْمَهَا يَسْجُدُونَ لِلشَّمْسِ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ وَزَيَّنَ لَهُمُ ٱلشَّيْطَانُ أَعْمَالَهُمْ فَصَدَّهُمْ عَنِ ٱلسَّبِيلِ فَهُمْ لاَ يَهْتَدُونَ,I found her and her people prostrating to the sun instead of God and Satan has adorned for them their deeds and he has barred them from the Way from the path of truth so that they are not guided
أَلاَّ يَسْجُدُواْ للَّهِ ٱلَّذِي يُخْرِجُ ٱلْخَبْءَ فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا تُخْفُونَ وَمَا تُعْلِنُونَ,to prostrate themselves to God allā yasjudū should be read as an yasjudū the lā is extra and with it has been assimilated the nūn of an similar to the construction where God says li-allā ya‘lama ahlu’l-kitābi so that the People of the Scripture may know Q. 5729; the sentence functions as the direct object of yahtadūna ‘guided’ whose ilā ‘to’ has been omitted; He Who brings forth the hidden al-khab’ is a verbal noun with the same meaning as al-makhbū’ ‘that which is hidden’ of rain and plants in the heavens and the earth and He knows what they conceal within their hearts and what they proclaim with their tongues.
ٱللَّهُ لاَ إِلَـٰهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ رَبُّ ٱلْعَرْشِ ٱلْعَظِيمِ,God — there is no god except Him the Lord of the Mighty Throne’ this clause constitutes an independent new sentence which is a eulogy comprising praise of the Throne of the Compassionate One to counter the description of the throne of Bilqīs between the two however is an unfathomable difference.
قَالَ سَنَنظُرُ أَصَدَقْتَ أَمْ كُنتَ مِنَ ٱلْكَاذِبِينَ,He Solomon said to the hoopoe ‘We shall see whether you have spoken the truth in what you have informed us or whether you are of the liars that is of their ilk — for to say that is rhetorically more powerful than simply saying ‘or whether you have lied’. He the hoopoe indicated to them the place of the water and it was extracted. They thus drank performed their ablutions and prayed. Solomon then composed a letter in the following form ‘From the servant of God Solomon son of David to Bilqīs Queen of Sheba. In the Name of God the Compassionate the Merciful Peace be upon those who follow Guidance. To wit do not rise up against me in defiance but come to me in submission’. He then stamped it with musk and sealed it with his ring and said to the hoopoe
ٱذْهَب بِّكِتَابِي هَـٰذَا فَأَلْقِهْ إِلَيْهِمْ ثُمَّ تَوَلَّ عَنْهُمْ فَٱنْظُرْ مَاذَا يَرْجِعُونَ,Take this letter of mine and deliver it to them that is to Bilqīs and her people then turn away withdraw from them but remain close by them and see what response they shall return’ and see what kind of response they shall give. Thus he took it and approached her Bilqīs. But as her soldiers were all around her he cast it into her private chamber. When she saw it she shuddered and was consumed by fear. She read what it said.
قَالَتْ يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلْمَلأُ إِنِّيۤ أُلْقِيَ إِلَيَّ كِتَابٌ كَرِيمٌ,Then she said to the noblemen of her people ‘O members of the council lo! read yā ayyuhā’l-mala’u innī pronouncing in the last two words both hamzas; or by not pronouncing the second one and changing it into a wāw with kasra vowelling a noble a sealed letter has been delivered to me.
إِنَّهُ مِن سُلَيْمَانَ وَإِنَّهُ بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَـٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ,It is from Solomon and lo! it is in other words its text says “In the Name of God the Compassionate the Merciful.
أَلاَّ تَعْلُواْ عَلَيَّ وَأْتُونِي مُسْلِمِينَ,Do not rise up against me in defiance but come to me in submission”’.
قَالَتْ يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلْمَلأُ أَفْتُونِي فِيۤ أَمْرِي مَا كُنتُ قَاطِعَةً أَمْراً حَتَّىٰ تَشْهَدُونِ,She said ‘O members of the council give me an opinion read yā ayyuhā’l-mala’u aftūnī pronouncing both hamzas or by not pronouncing the second and changing it into a wāw in other words guide me in this matter of mine. I never decide on a matter I never conclude it until you are present’.
قَالُواْ نَحْنُ أُوْلُو قُوَّةٍ وَأُولُو بَأْسٍ شَدِيدٍ وَٱلأَمْرُ إِلَيْكِ فَٱنظُرِي مَاذَا تَأْمُرِينَ,They said ‘We possess force and we possess great might in other words we are hardy in war. The matter is for you to decide. So see what you will command’ us and we will obey you.
قَالَتْ إِنَّ ٱلْمُلُوكَ إِذَا دَخَلُواْ قَرْيَةً أَفْسَدُوهَا وَجَعَلُوۤاْ أَعِزَّةَ أَهْلِهَآ أَذِلَّةً وَكَذٰلِكَ يَفْعَلُونَ,She said ‘Indeed kings when they enter a town ruin it with destruction and reduce the mightiest of its inhabitants to the most abased. That is what they too will do namely the senders of this letter.
وَإِنِّي مُرْسِلَةٌ إِلَيْهِمْ بِهَدِيَّةٍ فَنَاظِرَةٌ بِمَ يَرْجِعُ ٱلْمُرْسَلُونَ,Now I will send them a gift and wait to see with what response the envoys return’ in the way of accepting the gift or rejecting it. If it be a king to whom we have sent it he will accept it; but if it be a prophet he will reject it. Thus she sent male and female servants one thousand in total together with five hundred bricks of gold a crown studded with jewels and musk ambergris and other things with an envoy carrying a letter. The hoopoe thus hurried back to bring the news to Solomon who ordered bricks of gold and silver to be made and laid out across a vast square the distance of nine parasangs from his seat and for a towering wall of gold and silver to be constructed around it and for the most splendid creatures of the land and the sea together with the children of the jinn to be brought to line the right and left sides of the square.
فَلَمَّا جَآءَ سُلَيْمَانَ قَالَ أَتُمِدُّونَنِ بِمَالٍ فَمَآ آتَانِيَ ٱللَّهُ خَيْرٌ مِّمَّآ آتَاكُمْ بَلْ أَنتُمْ بِهَدِيَّتِكُمْ تَفْرَحُونَ,But when he the envoy came to Solomon with the gift and the servants he said ‘Are you supplying me with wealth? What God has given me of prophethood and kingship is better than what He has given you of the things of this world. Nay but it is you and not I who exult in your gift for you pride yourselves upon the possession of the ornaments of this world!
ٱرْجِعْ إِلَيْهِمْ فَلَنَأْتِيَنَّهُم بِجُنُودٍ لاَّ قِبَلَ لَهُمْ بِهَا وَلَنُخْرِجَنَّهُم مِّنْهَآ أَذِلَّةً وَهُمْ صَاغِرُونَ,Go back to them with the gifts that you have brought for We shall assuredly come to them with hosts which they will not be able to face and we shall expel them from there from the land of Sheba Saba’ — named thus after their tribal ancestor — humiliated and they shall be utterly abased’ unless they come to me in submission. When the envoy returned to her with the gift she had her throne placed inside seven doors inside her palace with her palace inside seven palaces and had all the doors locked with guards at them. She then prepared to make the journey to Solomon to see what he would command her. She departed with twelve thousand chieftains qayl each accompanied by thousands of men until when she came to within a parasang of him he sensed her arrival.
قَالَ يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلْمَلأُ أَيُّكُمْ يَأْتِينِي بِعَرْشِهَا قَبْلَ أَن يَأْتُونِي مُسْلِمِينَ,He said ‘O members of the council which of you regarding the two hamzas read them in the way mentioned above verse 32 will bring me her throne before they come to me in submission?’ compliant and obedient? For I may only rightfully seize it before this submission and not afterwards.
قَالَ عِفْرِيتٌ مِّن ٱلْجِنِّ أَنَاْ آتِيكَ بِهِ قَبْلَ أَن تَقُومَ مِن مَّقَامِكَ وَإِنِّي عَلَيْهِ لَقَوِيٌّ أَمِينٌ,An afreet from among the jinn — a jinn who is powerful and stalwart — said ‘I will bring it to you before you rise from your place the one in which you sit when adjudicating — the period from morning to midday. Indeed I have the strength for it that is for carrying it and I am trustworthy’ over what it may contain of jewels and other precious things. Solomon said ‘I want something faster than that!’
قَالَ ٱلَّذِي عِندَهُ عِلْمٌ مِّنَ ٱلْكِتَابِ أَنَاْ آتِيكَ بِهِ قَبْلَ أَن يَرْتَدَّ إِلَيْكَ طَرْفُكَ فَلَمَّا رَآهُ مُسْتَقِرّاً عِندَهُ قَالَ هَـٰذَا مِن فَضْلِ رَبِّي لِيَبْلُوَنِيۤ أَأَشْكُرُ أَمْ أَكْفُرُ وَمَن شَكَرَ فَإِنَّمَا يَشْكُرُ لِنَفْسِهِ وَمَن كَفَرَ فَإِنَّ رَبِّي غَنِيٌّ كَرِيمٌ,The one who had knowledge of the revealed Scripture — and this was one Āsif b. Barkhiyā a righteous individual with knowledge of God’s Greatest Name which when invoked in supplication for something it is immediately granted — said ‘I will bring it to you before your glance returns to you after you look at something. So he the afreet said to him ‘Look up towards the heaven’ which he did and when his glance returned in front of him he found it Bilqīs’ throne placed before him — for in the instance in which Solomon looked up to the heaven Āsif supplicated by invoking the Greatest Name that God bring it thereto; and this was done by having it travel under the earth until it sprung up below Solomon’s seat kursī. Then when he saw it standing still before him he said ‘This bringing it to me is of my Lord’s bounty that He may try me test me whether I give thanks read a-ashkur pronouncing both hamzas; or by replacing the second one with an alif; or by not pronouncing the second one but inserting an alif between the one not pronounced and the other one or without the insertion or am ungrateful for the favour. And whoever gives thanks gives thanks only for his own sake because the reward for his thanks shall be his and whoever is ungrateful for the favour should know then my Lord is surely Independent with no need of his thanks Generous’ by being bounteous to those who are ungrateful for it.
قَالَ نَكِّرُواْ لَهَا عَرْشَهَا نَنظُرْ أَتَهْتَدِيۤ أَمْ تَكُونُ مِنَ ٱلَّذِينَ لاَ يَهْتَدُونَ,He said ‘Disguise her throne for her — in other words transform it such that when she sees it it will be in an unrecognisable form — that we may see whether she will be guided to recognising it or be of those who cannot be guided’ to recognise when things are transformed around them. He Solomon sought thereby to test her mind for it was said to have something wrong with it. Thus they transformed it by adding or taking away certain things and in other ways.
فَلَمَّا جَآءَتْ قِيلَ أَهَكَذَا عَرْشُكِ قَالَتْ كَأَنَّهُ هُوَ وَأُوتِينَا ٱلْعِلْمَ مِن قَبْلِهَا وَكُنَّا مُسْلِمِينَ,So when she came it was said to her ‘Is your throne like this?’ She said ‘It as though it is the one’. She had in fact recognised it; but she made a pretence to them just as they made a pretence to her given that when she was asked about the throne it was not said ‘Is this your throne?’ for had it been so she would have replied ‘Yes it is’. When Solomon realised that she was perceptive and knowledgeable he said ‘And we were given the knowledge before her and we had submitted to God.
وَصَدَّهَا مَا كَانَت تَّعْبُدُ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ إِنَّهَا كَانَتْ مِن قَوْمٍ كَافِرِينَ,And what she worshipped besides God that is other than Him barred her from the worship of God for she belonged to disbelieving folk’.
قِيلَ لَهَا ٱدْخُلِي ٱلصَّرْحَ فَلَمَّا رَأَتْهُ حَسِبَتْهُ لُجَّةً وَكَشَفَتْ عَن سَاقَيْهَا قَالَ إِنَّهُ صَرْحٌ مُّمَرَّدٌ مِّن قَوارِيرَ قَالَتْ رَبِّ إِنِّي ظَلَمْتُ نَفْسِي وَأَسْلَمْتُ مَعَ سُلَيْمَانَ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ ٱلْعَالَمِينَ,It was also said to her ‘Enter the palace hallway’ — this was a transparent white glass floor underneath which flowed sweet water that contained fish. Solomon had it made when he was told that her legs and feet resembled the shanks of a mule. And when she saw it she supposed it to be a pool of water and so she bared her legs to wade through it. Meanwhile Solomon was seated on his throne at the front part of the palace hallway and he saw that her legs and feet were in fact fair. He said to her ‘It is a hallway paved smooth with crystal’ and thereafter he called her to submit to God. She said ‘My Lord indeed I have wronged myself by worshipping other than You and I submit with Solomon to God the Lord of the Worlds’. He wanted to marry her but disliked the hair on her legs. So the devils made a depilatory lime mixture nūra and she removed it therewith. He married her and had great love for her. And he let her remain as ruler of her kingdom and would visit her once a month staying for three days every time. Her reign came to an end at the same time as that of Solomon. It is reported that he became king at the age of 13 and died at the age of 53 — Glory be to the One whose enduring sovereignty will never end!
وَلَقَدْ أَرْسَلْنَآ إِلَىٰ ثَمُودَ أَخَاهُمْ صَالِحاً أَنِ ٱعْبُدُواْ ٱللَّهَ فَإِذَا هُمْ فَرِيقَانِ يَخْتَصِمُونَ,And verily We sent to Thamūd their brother in terms of his belonging to the same tribe Sālih with the following decree ‘Worship God!’ affirm His Oneness. And lo! they then became two parties quarrelling with one another over religion one party having become believers upon his arrival as messenger to them and the other party disbelievers.
قَالَ يٰقَوْمِ لِمَ تَسْتَعْجِلُونَ بِٱلسَّيِّئَةِ قَبْلَ ٱلْحَسَنَةِ لَوْلاَ تَسْتَغْفِرُونَ ٱللَّهَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُرْحَمُونَ,He said to the deniers ‘O my people why do you seek to hasten on evil before seeking good? in other words why do you seek to hasten on chastisement instead of mercy when you say ‘If what you bring us is true then bring us the chastisement!’ Why do you not ask God to forgive you your idolatry so that you might be shown mercy?’ and not be chastised.
قَالُواْ ٱطَّيَّرْنَا بِكَ وَبِمَن مَّعَكَ قَالَ طَائِرُكُمْ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ بَلْ أَنتُمْ قَوْمٌ تُفْتَنُونَ,They said ‘We augur evil ittayyarnā is actually tatayyarnā but the tā’ has been assimilated with the tā’ and a conjunctive hamza added of you and of those who are with you’ namely the believers — when they the tribe of Thamūd were deprived of rain and suffered hunger. He said ‘Your evil augury is with God — He has given it to you; nay but you are a people being tried’ being tested with good and evil turns of fortune.
وَكَانَ فِي ٱلْمَدِينَةِ تِسْعَةُ رَهْطٍ يُفْسِدُونَ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَلاَ يُصْلِحُونَ,And there were in the city the city of Thamūd a band of nine men that is nine men who were causing corruption in the land with acts of disobedience which included their corroding of dinar and dirham coins rendering them worthless and did not reform their ways through obedience to God.
قَالُواْ تَقَاسَمُواْ بِٱللَّهِ لَنُبَيِّتَنَّهُ وَأَهْلَهُ ثُمَّ لَنَقُولَنَّ لِوَلِيِّهِ مَا شَهِدْنَا مَهْلِكَ أَهْلِهِ وَإِنَّا لَصَادِقُونَ,They said that is some said to others ‘Swear to one another by God that we will attack him by night la-nubayyitannahu; or read la-tubayyitunnahu ‘that you will attack him by night’ together with his folk that is those who believed in him in other words swear that we will kill them at night; then we will surely say la-naqūlanna; or read la-taqūlunna ‘you surely will say’ to his heir the avenger of his blood that we did not witness we were not present at the destruction of his folk read muhlika or mahlika meaning ‘the destroying of them’ or ‘their death’ respectively and so we do not know who killed them and that indeed we are being truthful’.
وَمَكَرُواْ مَكْراً وَمَكَرْنَا مَكْراً وَهُمْ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ,So they plotted thereby a plot but We also plotted a plot in other words We requited them by hastening on their punishment while they were not aware.
فَٱنظُرْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَاقِبَةُ مَكْرِهِمْ أَنَّا دَمَّرْنَاهُمْ وَقَوْمَهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ,So behold how was the consequence of their plot! For lo! We destroyed them and all their people with Gabriel’s cry or by the angels’ pelting them with stones which they could see even though they could not see them the angels.
فَتِلْكَ بُيُوتُهُمْ خَاوِيَةً بِمَا ظَلَمُوۤاْ إِنَّ فِي ذٰلِكَ لآيَةً لِّقَوْمٍ يَعْلَمُونَ,So those then are their houses lying deserted khāwiyatan is in the accusative because it is a circumstantial qualifier the operator of which is the import of the demonstrative pronoun tilka ‘those’ because of the evil which they did that is their disbelief. Surely in that there is a sign a lesson for a people who have knowledge of Our power and are thus admonished.
وَأَنجَيْنَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَكَانُواْ يَتَّقُونَ,And We delivered those who believed in Sālih — and they numbered 4000 — and were fearful of idolatry.
وَلُوطاً إِذْ قَالَ لِقَوْمِهِ أَتَأْتُونَ ٱلْفَاحِشَةَ وَأَنتُمْ تُبْصِرُونَ,And Lot Lūtan is in the accusative because of an implied udhkur ‘mention’ before it and it Lūtan is substituted by the following idh qāla … when he said to his people ‘What! Do you commit such abomination namely homosexual intercourse while you watch? that is to say while you watch one another so engrossed are you in the sinful act?
أَإِنَّكُمْ لَتَأْتُونَ ٱلرِّجَالَ شَهْوَةً مِّن دُونِ ٱلنِّسَآءِ بَلْ أَنتُمْ قَوْمٌ تَجْهَلُونَ,What! Do you read a-innakum pronouncing both hamzas or by not pronouncing the second and inserting an alif between the two in both cases come unto men in lust instead of women? Nay but you are truly a people in ignorance’ of the consequence of your action.
فَمَا كَانَ جَوَابَ قَوْمِهِ إِلاَّ أَن قَالُوۤاْ أَخْرِجُوۤاْ آلَ لُوطٍ مِّن قَرْيَتِكُمْ إِنَّهمْ أُنَاسٌ يَتَطَهَّرُونَ,But the only response of his people was that they said ‘Expel Lot’s family from your town. They are indeed a folk who prefer to remain pure!’ from coming unto the rears of men.
فَأَنجَيْنَاهُ وَأَهْلَهُ إِلاَّ ٱمْرَأَتَهُ قَدَّرْنَاهَا مِنَ ٱلْغَابِرِينَ,So We delivered him and his family except his wife — We decreed for her We made her by Our decree to be of those who remained behind in the chastisement.
وَأَمْطَرْنَا عَلَيْهِم مَّطَراً فَسَآءَ مَطَرُ ٱلْمُنذَرِينَ,Then We rained on them a rain — these were the stones of baked mud cf. Q. 1574 — which destroyed them. And evil indeed was their rain the rain of those who were warned against chastisement.
قُلِ ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ وَسَلاَمٌ عَلَىٰ عِبَادِهِ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱصْطَفَىٰ ءَآللَّهُ خَيْرٌ أَمَّا يُشْرِكُونَ,Say O Muhammad (s) ‘Praise be to God for the destruction of the disbelievers of past communities and peace be on His servants whom He has chosen’. Is God read a-Allāhu pronouncing both hamzas; or by substituting an alif for the second one; or by not pronouncing the second one but inserting an alif between the one not pronounced and the other one or without such an insertion better for those who worship Him or the partners which they ascribe? read either tushrikūna ‘you ascribe’ or yushrikūna ‘they ascribe’ they being the people of Mecca the partners they ascribe to Him in other words are such gods better for those who worship them?
أَمَّنْ خَلَقَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضَ وَأَنزَلَ لَكُمْ مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مَآءً فَأَنبَتْنَا بِهِ حَدَآئِقَ ذَاتَ بَهْجَةٍ مَّا كَانَ لَكُمْ أَن تُنبِتُواْ شَجَرَهَا أَإِلَـٰهٌ مَّعَ ٱللَّهِ بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ يَعْدِلُونَ,Or He Who created the heavens and the earth and sends down for you water from the heaven whereby We cause to grow there is a shift here from third person to that of the first person plural splendid gardens hadā’iq is the plural of hadīqa which is an enclosed garden whose trees you could never cause to grow? because of you do not have the ability for it. Is there a god a-ilāhun here and in the seven instances in which it occurs read by pronouncing both hamzas or by not pronouncing the second inserting an alif between the two in both cases with God? who has helped Him in all of this? In other words there is no god with Him. Nay but they are a people who ascribe equals to Him who associate with God others.
أَمَّن جَعَلَ ٱلأَرْضَ قَرَاراً وَجَعَلَ خِلاَلَهَآ أَنْهَاراً وَجَعَلَ لَهَا رَوَاسِيَ وَجَعَلَ بَيْنَ ٱلْبَحْرَيْنِ حَاجِزاً أَإِلَـٰهٌ مَّعَ ٱلله بَلْ أَكْثَرُهُمْ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ,Or He Who made the earth an abode of stability that does not constantly shake beneath the feet of its inhabitants and made rivers to flow throughout it and set firm mountains for it with which He fixed the earth in place and set an isthmus between the two seas between the sweet one and the salty one the one not mixing with the other. Is there a god with God? Nay but most of them have no knowledge of His Oneness.
أَمَّن يُجِيبُ ٱلْمُضْطَرَّ إِذَا دَعَاهُ وَيَكْشِفُ ٱلسُّوۤءَ وَيَجْعَلُكُمْ خُلَفَآءَ ٱلأَرْضِ أَإِلَـٰهٌ مَّعَ ٱللَّهِ قَلِيلاً مَّا تَذَكَّرُونَ,Or He Who answers the desperate one the anguished person suffering harm when he calls to Him and Who removes his distress from him and from others and makes you successors in the earth the annexation khulafā’a l-ardi ‘successors of the earth’ has the same meaning as fī ‘in’ khulafā’a fī’l-ardi ‘successors in the earth’ in other words each generation succeeding the one before it. Is there a god with God? Little do you remember little are you admonished read mā tadhakkarūna ‘do you remember’; or read yadhdhakkarūna ‘do they remember’ where in both cases the tā’ has been assimilated with the dhāl; the mā is extra used to make less what is already ‘little’.
أَمَّن يَهْدِيكُمْ فِي ظُلُمَاتِ ٱلْبَرِّ وَٱلْبَحْرِ وَمَن يُرْسِلُ ٱلرِّيَاحَ بُشْرَاً بَيْنَ يَدَيْ رَحْمَتِهِ أَإِلَـٰهٌ مَّعَ ٱللَّهِ تَعَالَى ٱللَّهُ عَمَّا يُشْرِكُونَ,Or He Who guides you shows you the way to your destinations in the darkness of the land and the sea by the stars at night and by the various landmarks during the day and Who sends forth the winds as harbingers of His mercy ahead of the rain. Is there a god with God? Exalted be God high above what others they associate with Him!
أَمَّن يَبْدَؤُاْ ٱلْخَلْقَ ثُمَّ يُعيدُهُ وَمَن يَرْزُقُكُم مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ وٱلأَرْضِ أَإِلَـٰهٌ مَّعَ ٱللَّهِ قُلْ هَاتُواْ بُرْهَانَكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ صَادِقِينَ,Or He Who originates creation in the wombs from a sperm-drop then brings it back again after death as established by the proofs for this resurrection even if you do not acknowledge it; and Who provides for you from the heaven rain and from the earth vegetation. Is there a god with God? In other words none of the things mentioned is done by anyone other than God and there is no god with Him. Say O Muhammad (s) ‘Produce your proof your definitive argument if you are truthful’ about their being a god with Me who has done any of the things mentioned.
قُل لاَّ يَعْلَمُ مَن فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوٰتِ وٱلأَرْضِ ٱلْغَيْبَ إِلاَّ ٱللَّهُ وَمَا يَشْعُرُونَ أَيَّانَ يُبْعَثُونَ,They the disbelievers also asked him when the Hour will come to pass and the following was revealed Say ‘No one in the heavens or the earth knows be it angels or human beings the Unseen namely what is hidden from them except God He knows it and they are not aware the disbelievers of Mecca like others when is the time in which they will be resurrected.
بَلِ ٱدَّارَكَ عِلْمُهُمْ فِي ٱلآخِرَةِ بَلْ هُمْ فِي شَكٍّ مِّنْهَا بَلْ هُم مِّنْهَا عَمُونَ,Nay has their knowledge come to comprise read adraka similar to the 4th verbal form akrama ‘he was kind to’; a variant reading has iddāraka which is actually tadāraka with the tā’ changed into a dāl and assimilated with the other dāl and a conjunctive hamza added meaning ‘attained’ or ‘caught up with’ the Hereafter? such that they have reason to ask about the time of its coming — not so Nay for they are in doubt of it. Rather they are blind to it ‘amūna ‘blind’ as in blindness of the heart; this statement is rhetorically more powerful than the preceding one; the origin of the term is ‘amiyūn but the damma vowel is deemed too heavy for the yā’ and has been moved to the mīm after dropping its kasra vowel.
وَقَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوۤاْ أَإِذَا كُنَّا تُرَاباً وَآبَآؤُنَآ أَإِنَّا لَمُخْرَجُونَ,And the disbelievers say also in rejecting the idea of resurrection ‘What! When we and our fathers are dust shall we indeed be brought forth again? from the graves.
لَقَدْ وُعِدْنَا هَـٰذَا نَحْنُ وَآبَآؤُنَا مِن قَبْلُ إِنْ هَـٰذَآ إِلاَّ أَسَاطِيرُ ٱلأَوَّلِينَ,Already we and our fathers have been promised this before. But these are just the legendary fables of the ancients’ asātīr is the plural of ustūra meaning ‘what has been written down mā sutira of lies’.
قُلْ سِيرُواْ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ فَٱنظُرُواْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَٰقِبَةُ ٱلْمُجْرِمِينَ,Say ‘Travel in the land and see how was the sequel for the criminals’ because of their denials — and this sequel is that they were destroyed with punishment.
وَلاَ تَحْزَنْ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلاَ تَكُن فِي ضَيْقٍ مِّمَّا يَمْكُرُونَ,And do not grieve for them and do not be distressed by their schemes — this is meant to comfort the Prophet s in other words do not be concerned with their plotting against you for We will grant you victory over them.
وَيَقُولُونَ مَتَىٰ هَـٰذَا ٱلْوَعْدُ إِن كُنتُمْ صَادِقِينَ,And they say ‘When will this promise of chastisement be if you are truthful?’ regarding it.
قُلْ عَسَىٰ أَن يَكُونَ رَدِفَ لَكُم بَعْضُ ٱلَّذِي تَسْتَعْجِلُونَ,Say ‘It may be that part of what you seek to hasten on is close behind you’ — so they were slain at Badr and the remaining chastisement will come to them after death.
وَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَذُو فَضْلٍ عَلَى ٱلنَّاسِ وَلَـٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَهُمْ لاَ يَشْكُرُونَ,And surely your Lord is bountiful to mankind an example of which is His deferring chastisement for the disbelievers but most of them are not thankful — disbelievers are not grateful for the deferring of chastisement since they reject the fact that it will ever come to pass.
وَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَيَعْلَمُ مَا تُكِنُّ صُدُورُهُمْ وَمَا يُعْلِنُونَ,And surely your Lord knows what their hearts conceal what these hide and what they proclaim by their tongues.
وَمَا مِنْ غَآئِبَةٍ فِي ٱلسَّمَآءِ وَٱلأَرْضِ إِلاَّ فِي كِتَابٍ مُّبِينٍ,And there is not a thing hidden in the heaven and the earth the hā’ tā’ marbūta of ghā’ibatun is hyperbole in other words anything that is completely hidden from people but it is in a manifest Book namely in the Preserved Tablet al-lawh al-mahfūz and in God’s concealed knowledge an example of which is the time of the chastising of the disbelievers.
إِنَّ هَـٰذَا ٱلْقُرْآنَ يَقُصُّ عَلَىٰ بَنِيۤ إِسْرَائِيلَ أَكْثَرَ ٱلَّذِي هُمْ فِيهِ يَخْتَلِفُونَ,Truly this Qur’ān recounts to the Children of Israel — those living at the time of our Prophet — the means to resolve most of that concerning which they differ that is by virtue of the fact that it expounds the said differences as they should be eliminating any disagreements between them if only they were to implement it and submit to its prescriptions.
وَإِنَّهُ لَهُدًى وَرَحْمَةٌ لِّلْمُؤمِنِينَ,And truly it is a guidance from error and a mercy for believers from chastisement.
إِن رَبَّكَ يَقْضِي بَيْنَهُم بِحُكْمِهِ وَهُوَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْعَلِيمُ,Surely your Lord will decide between them as He will with others on the Day of Resurrection of His judgement that is His justice. And He is the Mighty the Victor the Knower of what He judges so that none will be able to oppose Him in the way that the disbelievers have opposed His prophets in this world.
فَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ إِنَّكَ عَلَى ٱلْحَقِّ ٱلْمُبِينِ,So rely on God trust in Him for you are indeed upon the manifest truth upon the manifest religion the sequel shall be in your favour with victory over the disbelievers. God then draws comparisons between them and the dead the deaf and the blind saying
إِنَّكَ لاَ تُسْمِعُ ٱلْمَوْتَىٰ وَلاَ تُسْمِعُ ٱلصُّمَّ ٱلدُّعَآءَ إِذَا وَلَّوْاْ مُدْبِرِينَ,Indeed you cannot make the dead hear nor can you make the deaf hear the call when al-du‘ā’a idhā read by pronouncing both hamzas or by not pronouncing the second one eliding it with the yā’ they have turned their backs upon you;
وَمَآ أَنتَ بِهَادِي ٱلْعُمْيِ عَن ضَلالَتِهِمْ إِن تُسْمِعُ إِلاَّ مَن يُؤْمِنُ بِآيَاتِنَا فَهُم مُّسْلِمُونَ,nor can you lead the blind out of their error. You can only make those hear — hear so as to comprehend and accept — who believe in Our signs — the Qur’ān — and have therefore submitted are therefore sincere in their affirmation of God’s Oneness.
وَإِذَا وَقَعَ ٱلْقَوْلُ عَلَيْهِم أَخْرَجْنَا لَهُمْ دَآبَّةً مِّنَ ٱلأَرْضِ تُكَلِّمُهُمْ أَنَّ ٱلنَّاسَ كَانُوا بِآيَاتِنَا لاَ يُوقِنُونَ,And when the word of judgement falls upon them when they deserve that chastisement befalls them as well as all other disbelievers We shall bring forth for them a beast from the earth which shall speak to them saying that is which shall speak in Arabic to those who are alive at the time when it appears among its other statements it will say to them on Our behalf ‘Indeed mankind read tukallimuhum inna’l-nāsa; a variant has tukallimuhum bi-anna’l-nāsa ‘to tell them that mankind’ had no faith in Our signs’ in other words they did not believe in the Qur’ān and what it comprises of the mention of resurrection reckoning and requital. With its the beast’s appearance the enjoining of decency and forbidding of indecency will cease and thereafter no disbeliever will believe — just as God revealed to Noah when He said to him None of your people will believe except he who has already believed Q. 1136.
وَيَوْمَ نَحْشُرُ مِن كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ فَوْجاً مِّمَّن يُكَذِّبُ بِآيَاتِنَا فَهُمْ يُوزَعُونَ,And mention the day when We shall gather from every community a group of those who denied Our signs namely their leaders the ones whom they followed and they will be set in array assembled with the last of them brought together with the first and then led away
حَتَّىٰ إِذَا جَآءُو قَالَ أَكَذَّبْتُم بِآيَاتِي وَلَمْ تُحِيطُواْ بِهَا عِلْماً أَمَّا ذَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ,until when they arrive at the site of the Reckoning He exalted be He shall say to them ‘Did you deny My prophets by denying My signs without comprehending them from the perspective of your denial in knowledge or what ammā the interrogative mā has been assimilated with am ‘or’ was it dhā is a relative pronoun in other words it is in fact mā alladhī that you did? with the commands given to you.
وَوَقَعَ ٱلْقَوْلُ عَلَيهِم بِمَا ظَلَمُواْ فَهُمْ لاَ يَنطِقُونَ,And the word of judgement shall fall the chastisement will be due upon them because of the evil they committed that is because of what they associated with God and they will not speak since they will have no valid argument.
أَلَمْ يَرَوْاْ أَنَّا جَعَلْنَا ٱلْلَّيْلَ لِيَسْكُنُواْ فِيهِ وَٱلنَّهَارَ مُبْصِراً إِنَّ فِي ذَلِكَ لآيَاتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يُؤْمِنُونَ,Do they not see that We made We created the night that they like others may rest in it and the day for sight? meaning for people to see in it so that they may go about their business therein. Surely in that there are signs indications of His power exalted be He for a people who believe — they the believers are singled out for mention because they benefit from such signs in their faith in contrast to the disbelievers.
وَيَوْمَ يُنفَخُ فِي ٱلصُّورِ فَفَزِعَ مَن فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَن فِي ٱلأَرْضِ إِلاَّ مَن شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ وَكُلٌّ أَتَوْهُ دَاخِرِينَ,And the day when the Trumpet will be blown the Horn will be blown the First Blast by the archangel Isrāfīl and whoever is in the heavens and the earth will be terrified that is a fright that brings about death — as is stated in another verse and whoever is in the heavens and whoever is in the earth will swoon Q. 3968 the past tense fazi‘a is used to express the fact that such events will have occurred; except whom God will namely Gabriel Michael Isrāfīl and the Angel of Death. According to Ibn ‘Abbās however these excepted individuals are the martyrs who are described as living with their Lord provided for by Him’ Q. 3169. And all kullun the nunation compensates for the missing genitive annexation in other words and every one of them after being brought back to life on the Day of Resurrection will come to Him read in the form of the verb atawhu or the active participle ātūhu in utter humility humbled the past tense atawhu is used to express the fact that this will have happened.
وَتَرَى ٱلْجِبَالَ تَحْسَبُهَا جَامِدَةً وَهِيَ تَمُرُّ مَرَّ ٱلسَّحَابِ صُنْعَ ٱللَّهِ ٱلَّذِيۤ أَتْقَنَ كُلَّ شَيْءٍ إِنَّهُ خَبِيرٌ بِمَا تَفْعَلُونَ,And you see the mountains you notice them at the moment of the Blast supposing them to be still stationary in their place because of their tremendous size while they drift like passing clouds like the drifting of the rain when it is blown around by the wind in other words they the mountains will be drifting in like manner until they eventually fall to the ground whereby they are flattened before becoming like tufts of ‘wool’ cf. Q. 1015 and then ‘scattered dust’ cf. Q. 566. God’s handiwork sun‘a a verbal noun emphasising the import of the preceding sentence and which has been annexed in a genitive construction to its agent Allāhi ‘God’ after the omission of its operator Who has perfected everything that He has made. Truly He is aware of what you do taf‘alūna; or read yaf‘alūna ‘what they do’ namely His enemies what they do in the way of disobedience and His friends in the way of obedience.
مَن جَآءَ بِٱلْحَسَنَةِ فَلَهُ خَيْرٌ مِّنْهَا وَهُمْ مِّن فَزَعٍ يَوْمَئِذٍ آمِنُونَ,Whoever brings a good deed namely the profession of ‘there is no god but God’ on the Day of Resurrection shall have good shall have a reward for it because of it this khayrun is not the comparative ‘better’ since there is no deed better than a good deed. In another verse it is stated that he shall have tenfold the like of it Q. 6160; and they namely those who bring such good deeds shall be secure from the terror of that day min faza‘i yawmi’idhin if read as a genitive annexation; or min faza‘in yawma’idhin ‘from terror on that day’.
وَمَن جَآءَ بِٱلسَّيِّئَةِ فَكُبَّتْ وُجُوهُهُمْ فِي ٱلنَّارِ هَلْ تُجْزَوْنَ إِلاَّ مَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ,And whoever brings an evil deed namely the ascribing of partners to God their faces shall be thrust into the Fire having been oriented towards it — ‘faces’ are specifically mentioned here because of all the sensory organs it is where a person’s dignity resides and so other parts of the body are more deserving of punishment. It shall be said to them in reproach ‘Are you requited except the requital for what you used to do?’ in the way of idolatry and acts of disobedience.
إِنَّمَآ أُمِرْتُ أَنْ أَعْبُدَ رَبَّ هَذِهِ ٱلْبَلْدَةِ ٱلَّذِي حَرَّمَهَا وَلَهُ كُلُّ شَيءٍ وَأُمِرْتُ أَنْ أَكُونَ مِنَ ٱلْمُسْلِمِينَ,Say to them I have been commanded only to worship the Lord of this land namely Mecca which He has made inviolable which He has made a secure Sanctuary one in which no human blood may be shed no person may be wronged none of its prey may be hunted and a sanctuary which is never deserted. Such were the graces bestowed by God upon its inhabitants the tribe of Quraysh graces whereby God has spared their land the suffering and civil strife common to all the other lands of the Arabs; and to Whom exalted be He all things belong for He is their Lord Creator and Possessor. And I have been commanded to be of those who submit to God by affirming His Oneness;
وَأَنْ أَتْلُوَاْ ٱلْقُرْآنَ فَمَنِ ٱهْتَدَىٰ فَإِنَّمَا يَهْتَدِي لِنَفْسِهِ وَمَن ضَلَّ فَقُلْ إِنَّمَآ أَنَاْ مِنَ ٱلْمُنذِرِينَ,and to recite the Qur’ān to you as a call to faith. So whoever is guided to it is guided only for his own sake since the reward for his being guided will be his; and whoever goes astray from faith and errs from the path of guidance say to him ‘I am just one of the warners’ the threateners and therefore my duty is only to deliver the Message — this was revealed before the command to fight against the disbelievers.
وَقُلِ ٱلْحَمْدُ للَّهِ سَيُرِيكُمْ آيَاتِهِ فَتَعْرِفُونَهَا وَمَا رَبُّكَ بِغَافِلٍ عَمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ,And say ‘Praise be to God. He will show you His signs and you will recognise them. Thus on the day of Badr God showed them how it was to be killed to be taken prisoner and to be beaten by the angels on their faces and backs; and God hastened on for them the punishment of the Fire. And your Lord is not oblivious of what they do’ ya‘malūna; or read ta‘malūna ‘what you do’ but grants them respite until their appointed time of requital.
طسۤمۤ,Tā sīn mīm God knows best what He means by these letters.
تِلْكَ آيَاتُ ٱلْكِتَابِ ٱلْمُبِينِ,Those namely these signs are the signs of the Manifest Book the genitive annexation conveys the partitive sense of min ‘of’ ‘verses from the Manifest Book’ the Manifest Book which reveals truth from falsehood.
نَتْلُواْ عَلَيْكَ مِن نَّبَإِ مُوسَىٰ وَفِرْعَوْنَ بِٱلْحَقِّ لِقَوْمٍ يُؤْمِنُونَ,We will recount narrate to you something of the tale of Moses and Pharaoh truthfully for a people who believe for their sake since they are the ones to benefit from such an account.
إِنَّ فِرْعَوْنَ عَلاَ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَجَعَلَ أَهْلَهَا شِيَعاً يَسْتَضْعِفُ طَآئِفَةً مِّنْهُمْ يُذَبِّحُ أَبْنَآءَهُمْ وَيَسْتَحْيِي نِسَاءَهُمْ إِنَّهُ كَانَ مِنَ ٱلْمُفْسِدِينَ,Truly Pharaoh had exalted himself in the land the land of Egypt and reduced its people into sects groups to serve him oppressing a group of them namely the Children of Israel slaughtering their sons the new-born and sparing their women keeping them alive — for some of the Egyptian priests had told him ‘A new-born of the Children of Israel shall bring about the end of your kingdom’. Indeed he was of those who cause corruption through the use of slaughter and otherwise.
وَنُرِيدُ أَن نَّمُنَّ عَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ ٱسْتُضْعِفُواْ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَنَجْعَلَهُمْ أَئِمَّةً وَنَجْعَلَهُمُ ٱلْوَارِثِينَ,And We desired to show favour to those who were oppressed in the land and to make them exemplars read a’immatan pronouncing both hamzas or by replacing the second one with a yā’ whose good example would be followed and to make them the inheritors of Pharaoh’s kingdom;
وَنُمَكِّنَ لَهُمْ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَنُرِيَ فِرْعَوْنَ وَهَامَانَ وَجُنُودَهُمَا مِنْهُمْ مَّا كَانُواْ يَحْذَرُونَ,and to establish them in the land the land of Egypt and Syria and to show Pharaoh and Hāmān and their hosts a variant reading has wa-yarā Fir‘awnu wa-Hāmānu wa-junūduhumā ‘so that Pharaoh and Hāmān and their hosts might see’ with all three nouns in the nominative from them that of which they were apprehensive that which they feared of the new-born Israelite who would bring about the end of their kingdom.
وَأَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَىٰ أُمِّ مُوسَىٰ أَنْ أَرْضِعِيهِ فَإِذَا خِفْتِ عَلَيْهِ فَأَلْقِيهِ فِي ٱليَمِّ وَلاَ تَخَافِي وَلاَ تَحْزَنِيۤ إِنَّا رَآدُّوهُ إِلَيْكِ وَجَاعِلُوهُ مِنَ ٱلْمُرْسَلِينَ,And We revealed by inspiration or in a dream to the mother of Moses — who was the said new-born; his sister was the only other person aware of his birth — ‘Suckle him then when you fear for him cast him into the waters namely the Nile and do not fear that he should drown or grieve for being separated from him for We will restore him to you and make him one of the messengers’. She suckled him for three months during which he never cried. She then began to fear for him and so she placed him in a basket coated with pitch and made as a cradle for him on the inside. She then closed it and cast it into the waters of the Nile at night.
فَٱلْتَقَطَهُ آلُ فِرْعَوْنَ لِيَكُونَ لَهُمْ عَدُوّاً وَحَزَناً إِنَّ فِرْعَوْنَ وَهَامَانَ وَجُنُودَهُمَا كَانُواْ خَاطِئِينَ,Then Pharaoh’s folk aids picked him up with him still in the basket the morning following that night — it was placed him in front of him Pharaoh and then opened and Moses was brought out of it sucking milk from his thumb — to be at the end of the affair an enemy slaying their menfolk and a cause of grief to them enslaving their womenfolk a variant reading for hazanan is huznan both of which are alternative forms of the verbal noun and it functions as an active participle derived from hazanahu which is like ahzanahu ‘he caused him grief’. Truly Pharaoh and his minister Hāmān and their hosts were sinners that is disobedient and so they were punished at his Moses’s hands.
وَقَالَتِ ٱمْرَأَةُ فِرْعَوْنَ قُرَّتُ عَيْنٍ لِّي وَلَكَ لاَ تَقْتُلُوهُ عَسَىٰ أَن يَنْفَعَنَا أَوْ نَتَّخِذَهُ وَلَداً وَهُمْ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ,And Pharaoh’s wife said after he and his aids had resolved to slay him he is ‘A joyous sight for me and you. Do not slay him. Perhaps he will be of benefit to us or we will adopt him as a son’ and so they obeyed her wish. And they were not aware of the sequel to their affair with him.
وَأَصْبَحَ فُؤَادُ أُمِّ مُوسَىٰ فَارِغاً إِن كَادَتْ لَتُبْدِي بِهِ لَوْلاۤ أَن رَّبَطْنَا عَلَىٰ قَلْبِهَا لِتَكُونَ مِنَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,And the heart of Moses’s mother when she found out that they had picked him up became empty of everything other than him. Indeed in softened from the hardened form its subject omitted in other words understand it as innaha she was about to expose him that is as being her son had We not fortified her heart with patience that is We made it at peace that she might be of the believers of those who have faith in God’s promise the response to the conditional lawlā ‘had … not’ is given by the preceding statement.
وَقَالَتْ لأُخْتِهِ قُصِّيهِ فَبَصُرَتْ بِهِ عَن جُنُبٍ وَهُمْ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ,And she said to his sister Mary ‘Follow him’ in other words follow where he goes in order to find out his news. So she watched him from afar from a distance secretly while they were not aware that she was his sister or that she was even watching him.
وَحَرَّمْنَا عَلَيْهِ ٱلْمَرَاضِعَ مِن قَبْلُ فَقَالَتْ هَلْ أَدُلُّكُمْ عَلَىٰ أَهْلِ بَيْتٍ يَكْفُلُونَهُ لَكُمْ وَهُمْ لَهُ نَاصِحُونَ,And We had forbidden him to take to the breasts of fostermothers from before that is to say we prevented him from taking to the breasts of any suckling mother other than his own mother. Therefore he would not accept the breasts of any of the foster-mothers brought for him. So she his sister said ‘Shall I show you a household — having seen their affection for him — who will take care of him for you by having him suckled and so on and who will act in good faith towards him?’ the suffixed pronoun in lahu has been interpreted as referring to the king as a response to them when they asked Mary how she could be sure. Her suggestion was accepted. So she brought his mother and he took to her breast. She explained to them that he had taken to her breast because of her pleasant scent and the wholesome taste of her milk. Permission was given to her to breast-feed him in her own house and so she returned with him just as God exalted be He says
فَرَدَدْنَاهُ إِلَىٰ أُمِّهِ كَيْ تَقَرَّ عَيْنُهَا وَلاَ تَحْزَنَ وَلِتَعْلَمَ أَنَّ وَعْدَ ٱللَّهِ حَقٌّ وَلَـٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَهُمْ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ,Thus We restored him to his mother so that her eyes might delight in seeing him again and not grieve thereat and that she might know that God’s promise to restore him to her is true; but most of them that is the people do not know about this promise or of the fact that this was his sister and the other was his mother. He Moses remained with her until he was weaned during which time she was paid wages at one dinar per day. She took this because it was money from enemy territory harbī. She then brought him back to Pharaoh in whose household he was raised as God recounts of him in sūrat al-Shu‘arā’ Q. 2618 Did we not rear you among us as a child and did you not stay with us for years of your life?
وَلَمَّا بَلَغَ أَشُدَّهُ وَٱسْتَوَىٰ آتَيْنَاهُ حُكْماً وَعِلْماً وَكَذَلِكَ نَجْزِي ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,And when he came of age namely at 30 or 33 and then was fully mature that is when he reached the age of 40 We gave him judgement wisdom and knowledge comprehension of religious matters before he was sent as a prophet. And so just as We rewarded him do We reward those are virtuous to their own souls.
وَدَخَلَ ٱلْمَدِينَةَ عَلَىٰ حِينِ غَفْلَةٍ مِّنْ أَهْلِهَا فَوَجَدَ فِيهَا رَجُلَيْنِ يَقْتَتِلاَنِ هَـٰذَا مِن شِيعَتِهِ وَهَـٰذَا مِنْ عَدُوِّهِ فَٱسْتَغَاثَهُ ٱلَّذِي مِن شِيعَتِهِ عَلَى ٱلَّذِي مِنْ عَدُوِّهِ فَوَكَزَهُ مُوسَىٰ فَقَضَىٰ عَلَيْهِ قَالَ هَـٰذَا مِنْ عَمَلِ ٱلشَّيْطَانِ إِنَّهُ عَدُوٌّ مُّضِلٌّ مُّبِينٌ,And he Moses entered the city Pharaoh’s city Memphis having been absent from it for a while at a time when its people were oblivious the time of the afternoon nap and found therein two men fighting one of his own faction namely an Israelite and the other of his enemies in other words an Egyptian who was exploiting an Israelite to carry firewood to Pharaoh’s kitchen. So the one who was of his faction called to him for help against the one who was of his enemies and so Moses said to him ‘Leave him be!’ and it is said that he replied to Moses thus ‘I am truly considering making you carry this firewood!’. So Moses punched him that is he hit him with his fist clenched — he Moses was a strong man with a powerful strike and did away with him that is he killed him but he had not intended to kill him. He buried him in the sand. He said ‘This killing of him is of Satan’s doing inciting my anger. Indeed he is an enemy to the son of Adam a manifest misleader’ of him.
قَالَ رَبِّ إِنِّي ظَلَمْتُ نَفْسِي فَٱغْفِرْ لِي فَغَفَرَ لَهُ إِنَّهُ هُوَ ٱلْغَفُورُ ٱلرَّحِيمُ,He said remorsefully ‘My Lord I have indeed wronged myself by killing him so forgive me!’ So He forgave him. Truly He is the Forgiving the Merciful that is to say the One Who has always possessed and will always possess these two attributes.
قَالَ رَبِّ بِمَآ أَنْعَمْتَ عَلَيَّ فَلَنْ أَكُونَ ظَهِيراً لِّلْمُجْرِمِينَ,He said ‘My Lord forasmuch as You have been gracious to me with forgiveness protect me so I will never be a partisan a supporter of the criminals’ the disbelievers henceforth if you were to protect me.
فَأَصْبَحَ فِي ٱلْمَدِينَةِ خَآئِفاً يَتَرَقَّبُ فَإِذَا ٱلَّذِي ٱسْتَنْصَرَهُ بِٱلأَمْسِ يَسْتَصْرِخُهُ قَالَ لَهُ مُوسَىٰ إِنَّكَ لَغَوِيٌّ مُّبِينٌ,In the morning he was in the city fearful vigilant waiting to see what would happen to him in reaction from the side of the slain man; — when behold the one who had sought his help the day before cried out to him for help again asking for his help against another Egyptian. Moses said to him ‘Clearly you are a trouble-maker!’ whose trouble-making is evident judging by what you did yesterday and today.
فَلَمَّآ أَنْ أَرَادَ أَن يَبْطِشَ بِٱلَّذِي هُوَ عَدُوٌّ لَّهُمَا قَالَ يٰمُوسَىٰ أَتُرِيدُ أَن تَقْتُلَنِي كَمَا قَتَلْتَ نَفْساً بِٱلأَمْسِ إِن تُرِيدُ إِلاَّ أَن تَكُونَ جَبَّاراً فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَمَا تُرِيدُ أَن تَكُونَ مِنَ ٱلْمُصْلِحِينَ,But when fa-lammā an an is extra he was about to strike the man who was an enemy to both of them to Moses and the one seeking his help he the one seeking help supposing that Moses was about to strike him because of what he Moses had said to him said ‘O Moses do you want to slay me just as you slew a soul yesterday? You merely want to be a tyrant in the land and you do not want to be of the reformers’. The Egyptian heard this and realised that the slayer had been Moses. Thus he hurried off to Pharaoh to inform him of this. Pharaoh then ordered slaughterers to slay Moses and they set off in his direction.
وَجَآءَ رَجُلٌ مِّنْ أَقْصَا ٱلْمَدِينَةِ يَسْعَىٰ قَالَ يٰمُوسَىٰ إِنَّ ٱلْمَلأَ يَأْتَمِرُونَ بِكَ لِيَقْتُلُوكَ فَٱخْرُجْ إِنِّي لَكَ مِنَ ٱلنَّاصِحِينَ,And a man who was the only believer among Pharaoh’s kinsfolk came from the outskirts of the city hastening walking fast via a route quicker than theirs. He said ‘O Moses lo! the council of Pharaoh’s folk are conspiring discussing the means to slay you. So leave the city. Truly I am speaking to you in good faith’ in bidding you to leave.
فَخَرَجَ مِنْهَا خَآئِفاً يَتَرَقَّبُ قَالَ رَبِّ نَجِّنِي مِنَ ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ,So he departed from it fearful vigilant lest any of the pursuers catch up with him or in the hope that God might rescue him. He said ‘My Lord deliver me from the evildoing people’ Pharaoh’s people.
وَلَمَّا تَوَجَّهَ تِلْقَآءَ مَدْيَنَ قَالَ عَسَىٰ رَبِّيۤ أَن يَهْدِيَنِي سَوَآءَ ٱلسَّبِيلِ,And when he turned his face towards Midian in the direction thereof — and this Midian was the town of the prophet Shu‘ayb eight day’s journeying from Egypt so named after Midian son of Abraham; he Moses did not know the route to it — he said ‘Perhaps my Lord will show me the right way’ that is to say which route to follow in other words the simplest route to it. God thus sent forth to him an angel with a goat which he Moses set off following towards it the town.
وَلَمَّا وَرَدَ مَآءَ مَدْيَنَ وَجَدَ عَلَيْهِ أُمَّةً مِّنَ ٱلنَّاسِ يَسْقُونَ وَوَجَدَ مِن دُونِهِمُ ٱمْرَأَتَينِ تَذُودَانِ قَالَ مَا خَطْبُكُمَا قَالَتَا لاَ نَسْقِي حَتَّىٰ يُصْدِرَ ٱلرِّعَآءُ وَأَبُونَا شَيْخٌ كَبِيرٌ,And when he arrived at the Water of Midian the name of a well therein he found a group of people there watering their flocks and he found besides them two women holding back their flock from the water. He Moses said to the two ‘What is your business?’ that is ‘What is the matter with you that you are not watering?’ They said ‘We do not water our flock until the shepherds have moved on ri‘ā’u ‘shepherds’ the plural of rā‘in that is to say until they have returned from the watering for fear of being crushed by the throng after which we go to water a variant reading for yasdiru ‘move on’ is the 4th form subjunctive yusdira ‘to drive away’ meaning until they the shepherds have driven their flocks away from the water’ and our father is a very old man’ unable to come and water.
فَسَقَىٰ لَهُمَا ثُمَّ تَوَلَّىٰ إِلَى ٱلظِّلِّ فَقَالَ رَبِّ إِنِّي لِمَآ أَنزَلْتَ إِلَيَّ مِنْ خَيْرٍ فَقِيرٌ,So he watered their flock for them from another well nearby by lifting a rock from on top of it which only ten men could have lifted; then he retreated to the shade of an acacia tree samura because of the extreme heat of the sun and he was hungry and said ‘My Lord indeed I am in utter need of whatever good whatever food You send down to me’. The two women returned to their father quicker than usual and so he asked them why it was so. They told him about the man who had watered their flock for them. So he said to one of them ‘Summon him to come to me’.
فَجَآءَتْهُ إِحْدَاهُمَا تَمْشِي عَلَى ٱسْتِحْيَآءٍ قَالَتْ إِنَّ أَبِي يَدْعُوكَ لِيَجْزِيَكَ أَجْرَ مَا سَقَيْتَ لَنَا فَلَمَّا جَآءَهُ وَقَصَّ عَلَيْهِ ٱلْقَصَصَ قَالَ لاَ تَخَفْ نَجَوْتَ مِنَ ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ,God exalted be He says Then one of the two women came to him walking bashfully — in other words covering her face with the sleeve of her shirt being shy of him — and said ‘My father invites you that he may pay you a wage for watering our flock for us’. He accepted her invitation while inwardly he disapproved of accepting any wage for it was as though she sought to remunerate him and as though he were of those who would want it which he was not. She walked in front of him but when the wind began to blow off her dress and reveal her legs he said to her ‘Walk behind me and show me the way’ which she did. Finally he came to her father Shu‘ayb peace be upon him who was sitting with some supper in front of him. He said to him ‘Sit and have some supper’. He Moses said ‘I hope that this is not some sort of compensation for having watered their flock for them? For we are People of a House and do not demand compensation for good deeds’. He Shu‘ayb said ‘No. It is simply a custom of mine and of my forefathers to be hospitable to guests and to offer them food’. Thus he Moses ate and informed him of his predicament. God exalted be He says So when he came to him and recounted to him the story al-qasas is a verbal noun with the sense of al-maqsūs ‘that which is recounted’ of his slaying of the Egyptian and their intention to slay him and his fear of Pharaoh he their father said ‘Do not be afraid. You have escaped from the evildoing people’ as Pharaoh had no authority over Midian.
قَالَتْ إِحْدَاهُمَا يٰأَبَتِ ٱسْتَئْجِرْهُ إِنَّ خَيْرَ مَنِ ٱسْتَئْجَرْتَ ٱلْقَوِيُّ ٱلأَمِينُ,One of the two women the one that had been sent by her father either the elder or the younger said ‘O my father hire him employ him in return for a wage that he may tend our flock instead of us. Surely the best man you can hire is the strong the trustworthy man’ in other words hire him on account of his strength and trustworthiness. He Shu‘ayb asked her about him and she told him as mentioned above how he had lifted the rock off the well and that he had said to her ‘Walk behind me’ in addition to his lowering his head when he realised that she was coming towards him refusing to lift it until she left. He Shu‘ayb therefore was keen to have him marry one of his daughters.
قَالَ إِنِّيۤ أُرِيدُ أَنْ أُنكِحَكَ إِحْدَى ٱبْنَتَيَّ هَاتَيْنِ عَلَىٰ أَن تَأْجُرَنِي ثَمَانِيَ حِجَجٍ فَإِنْ أَتْمَمْتَ عَشْراً فَمِنْ عِندِكَ وَمَآ أُرِيدُ أَنْ أَشُقَّ عَلَيْكَ سَتَجِدُنِي إِن شَاءَ اللَّهُ مِنَ الصَّالِحِينَ,He said ‘I desire to marry you to one of these two daughters of mine either the elder or the younger one on condition that you hire yourself to me that you are employed by me to tend my flock for eight years. And if you complete ten that is the tending of ten years that completion shall be of your own accord. I do not want to be hard on you by making it the marriage conditional on ten years service. God willing — expressed to seek God’s blessing — you shall find me to be one of the righteous’ of those who fulfil their covenants.
قَالَ ذَلِكَ بَيْنِي وَبَيْنَكَ أَيَّمَا ٱلأَجَلَيْنِ قَضَيْتُ فَلاَ عُدْوَانَ عَلَيَّ وَٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ مَا نَقُولُ وَكِيلٌ,He Moses said ‘That which you have said is settled then between me and you. Whichever of the two terms the eight or the ten the mā in ayyamā ‘whichever of the two’ is extra in other words the tending thereof I complete there shall be no injustice done to me by demanding of me to do more tending. And God is Guardian Keeper or Witness over what we you and I say’. The contract was agreed in this way. Shu‘ayb bid his daughter to give Moses a staff with which to beat off predatory beasts from his sheep — the staffs of the prophets were in his keeping. It was Adam’s staff made from the myrtle of Paradise that fell into her hands and so Moses took it with Shu‘ayb’s knowledge.
فَلَمَّا قَضَىٰ مُوسَى ٱلأَجَلَ وَسَارَ بِأَهْلِهِ آنَسَ مِن جَانِبِ ٱلطُّورِ نَاراً قَالَ لأَهْلِهِ ٱمْكُثُوۤاْ إِنِّيۤ آنَسْتُ نَاراً لَّعَلِّيۤ آتِيكُمْ مِّنْهَا بِخَبَرٍ أَوْ جَذْوَةٍ مِّنَ ٱلنَّارِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَصْطَلُونَ,So when Moses had completed the term of his tending — of eight years or of ten years which is what is generally assumed — and was travelling with his family his wife with the permission of her father in the direction of Egypt he saw in the distance on the side of the Mount Tūr a fire al-Tūr is the name of a mountain. He said to his family ‘Wait here; I see a fire in the distance. Maybe I will bring you from it news about how to rejoin the route to Egypt — for he had strayed from it along the way — or a brand read with any of the three vowels jadhwa jidhwa or judhwa which either means ‘a bundle’ or ‘a flame’ from the fire that you may warm yourselves’ tastalūna the tā’ replaces the tā’ of the 8th verbal paradigm ifta‘ala of the verb saliya or salaya.
فَلَمَّآ أَتَاهَا نُودِيَ مِن شَاطِىءِ ٱلْوَادِي ٱلأَيْمَنِ فِي ٱلْبُقْعَةِ ٱلْمُبَارَكَةِ مِنَ ٱلشَّجَرَةِ أَن يٰمُوسَىٰ إِنِّيۤ أَنَا ٱللَّهُ رَبُّ ٱلْعَالَمِينَ,And when he reached it a call came from the right bank the right side of the valley to Moses at the blessed spot blessed for Moses because of his hearing God’s speech therein from the tree mina’l-shajarati substitutes for min shāti’i ‘from the right bank’ and the preposition min ‘from’ has been repeated because it the tree grows there — the tree was a jujube a bramble or a boxthorn — saying that an here is explicative and not in its softened form ‘O Moses! Indeed I am God the Lord of the Worlds’.
وَأَنْ أَلْقِ عَصَاكَ فَلَمَّا رَآهَا تَهْتَزُّ كَأَنَّهَا جَآنٌّ وَلَّىٰ مُدْبِراً وَلَمْ يُعَقِّبْ يٰمُوسَىٰ أَقْبِلْ وَلاَ تَخَفْ إِنَّكَ مِنَ ٱلآمِنِينَ,And ‘Throw down your staff’ and he threw it down. And when he saw it quivering moving as if it were a serpent jānn is a small snake so called because of the speed of its movement he turned his back to flee from it and did not look back in other words he did not return and so there called out the voice ‘O Moses! Come forward and do not be afraid. Indeed you are safe.
ٱسْلُكْ يَدَكَ فِي جَيْبِكَ تَخْرُجْ بَيْضَآءَ مِنْ غَيْرِ سُوۤءٍ وَٱضْمُمْ إِلَيْكَ جَنَاحَكَ مِنَ ٱلرَّهْبِ فَذَانِكَ بُرْهَانَانِ مِن رَّبِّكَ إِلَىٰ فِرْعَوْنَ وَمَلَئِهِ إِنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ قَوْماً فَاسِقِينَ,Insert your right hand meaning the palm into your bosom jayb is the neck area of the shirt and then take it out and it will emerge not in its usual skin colour but white without any blemish any vestige of leprosy. So he inserted it and took it out and it shone as bright as the sun blinding the eyes; and draw your arm back to your side as a precaution against fear read rahab rahb or ruhb in other words against the fear produced by the glow of the hand so that you insert it back into your bosom and it is restored to its former state; it the arm is referred to as jināh ‘wing’ because they are for humans what wings are for birds. These then read fa-dhānika or fa-dhānnika namely the staff and the hand both of which ‘asā and yad are feminine nouns but the demonstrative pronoun dhānika used for them being the subject is in the masculine because its predicate is masculine shall be two proofs to be sent from your Lord to Pharaoh and his council; for surely they are an immoral people’.
قَالَ رَبِّ إِنِّي قَتَلْتُ مِنْهُمْ نَفْساً فَأَخَافُ أَن يَقْتُلُونِ,He said ‘My Lord I have indeed slain a soul among them — the mentioned Egyptian — and so I fear that they will slay me because of him.
وَأَخِي هَارُونُ هُوَ أَفْصَحُ مِنِّي لِسَاناً فَأَرْسِلْهُ مَعِيَ رِدْءاً يُصَدِّقُنِي إِنِّيۤ أَخَافُ أَن يُكَذِّبُونِ,And my brother Aaron is more eloquent more intelligible than me in speech. So send him with me as a helper as an aid a variant reading for rid’an ‘helper’ is ridan to confirm me read either in apocopated form yusadiqnī as a response to the request or as an indicative with damma inflection yusadiqunī as an adjectival qualification of rid’an ‘helper’ for I truly fear that they will deny me’.
قَالَ سَنَشُدُّ عَضُدَكَ بِأَخِيكَ وَنَجْعَلُ لَكُمَا سُلْطَاناً فَلاَ يَصِلُونَ إِلَيْكُمَا بِآيَاتِنَآ أَنتُمَا وَمَنِ ٱتَّبَعَكُمَا ٱلْغَالِبُونَ,He said ‘We will strengthen your arm We will make you strong by means of your brother and We will give authority victory so that they will not be able to touch either of you with any evil; go both of you with Our signs the two of you and those who follow you two will be the victors’ over them.
فَلَمَّا جَآءَهُم مُّوسَىٰ بِآيَاتِنَا بَيِّنَاتٍ قَالُواْ مَا هَـٰذَآ إِلاَّ سِحْرٌ مُّفْتَرًى وَمَا سَمِعْنَا بِهَـٰذَا فِيۤ آبَآئِنَا ٱلأَوَّلِينَ,But when Moses brought them Our clear signs bayyinātin a circumstantial qualifier they said ‘This is nothing but concocted invented sorcery. And we never heard of such a thing to have ever existed in the days of our forefathers’.
وَقَالَ مُوسَىٰ رَبِّيۤ أَعْلَمُ بِمَن جَآءَ بِٱلْهُدَىٰ مِنْ عِندِهِ وَمَن تَكُونُ لَهُ عَاقِبَةُ ٱلدَّارِ إِنَّهُ لاَ يُفْلِحُ ٱلظَّالِمُونَ,And Moses said wa-qāla or qāla without the ‘and’ ‘My Lord knows best who brings guidance from Him the suffixed pronoun in ‘indihi refers to the Lord and whose man here is a supplement to the previous man will be read takūna or yakūna the sequel of the Blissful Abode that is to say the praiseworthy sequel in the Abode of the Hereafter in other words it is I Moses in both cases and I speak truthfully in what I have brought you. Truly the evildoers the disbelievers will not be successful’.
وَقَالَ فِرْعَوْنُ يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلْملأُ مَا عَلِمْتُ لَكُمْ مِّنْ إِلَـٰهٍ غَيْرِي فَأَوْقِدْ لِي يٰهَامَانُ عَلَى ٱلطِّينِ فَٱجْعَل لِّي صَرْحاً لَّعَلِّيۤ أَطَّلِعُ إِلَىٰ إِلَـٰهِ مُوسَىٰ وَإِنِّي لأَظُنُّهُ مِنَ ٱلْكَاذِبِينَ,And Pharaoh said ‘O members of the council I do not know of any god for you other than me. So kindle for me O Hāmān a fire over the clay and bake for me bricks of clay and make me a tower a lofty palace that I may take a look at the god of Moses to observe him and inspect him; for truly I consider him to be a liar’ in his claim of the existence of some other god and that he is his messenger.
وَٱسْتَكْبَرَ هُوَ وَجُنُودُهُ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ بِغَيْرِ ٱلْحَقِّ وَظَنُّوۤاْ أَنَّهُمْ إِلَيْنَا لاَ يُرْجَعُونَ,And he and his hosts acted arrogantly in the land the land of Egypt without right and thought they would not return to Us read active yarji‘ūna or passive yurja‘ūna ‘they would not be brought back’.
فَأَخَذْنَاهُ وَجُنُودَهُ فَنَبَذْنَاهُمْ فِي ٱلْيَمِّ فَٱنظُرْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَاقِبَةُ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ,So We seized him and his hosts and flung them into the waters the sea and they drowned. So behold how was the sequel for the evildoers when they ended up being destroyed.
وَجَعَلْنَاهُمْ أَئِمَّةً يَدْعُونَ إِلَى ٱلنَّارِ وَيَوْمَ ٱلْقِيامَةِ لاَ يُنصَرُونَ,And We made them in this world leaders read a-imma pronouncing both hamzas or by changing the second one into a yā’ chieftains of idolatry who invite to the Fire by inviting to idolatry and on the Day of Resurrection they will not be helped by having the chastisement averted from them.
وَأَتْبَعْنَاهُم فِي هَذِهِ ٱلدُّنْيَا لَعْنَةً وَيَوْمَ القِيَامَةِ هُمْ مِّنَ ٱلْمَقْبُوحِينَ,And We made a curse ignominy pursue them in this world and on the Day of Resurrection they will be among the spurned those banished from God’s mercy.
وَلَقَدْ آتَيْنَا مُوسَى ٱلْكِتَابَ مِن بَعْدِ مَآ أَهْلَكْنَا ٱلْقُرُونَ ٱلأُولَىٰ بَصَآئِرَ لِلنَّاسِ وَهُدًى وَرَحْمَةً لَّعَلَّهُمْ يَتَذَكَّرُونَ,And verily We gave Moses the Scripture the Torah after We had destroyed the former generations the people of Noah ‘Ād Thamūd and others containing eye-openers for mankind basā’ira is a circumstantial qualifier referring to al-kitāb ‘the Scripture’ the plural of basīra which is the perceptive light of the heart in other words illumination for the hearts of mankind and as guidance from error for those who implement it and mercy for those who believe therein that perhaps they might remember that they might be admonished by the admonitions it the Scripture contains.
وَمَا كُنتَ بِجَانِبِ ٱلْغَرْبِيِّ إِذْ قَضَيْنَآ إِلَىٰ مُوسَى ٱلأَمْرَ وَمَا كنتَ مِنَ ٱلشَّاهِدِينَ,And you were not O Muhammad (s) on the western side of the mountain the valley or the spot to the west of Moses at the time of the communion when We decreed revealed to Moses the commandment to deliver the Message to Pharaoh and his people nor were you among the witnesses to this to know it and inform of it;
وَلَكِنَّآ أَنشَأْنَا قُرُوناً فَتَطَاوَلَ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلْعُمُرُ وَمَا كُنتَ ثَاوِياً فِيۤ أَهْلِ مَدْيَنَ تَتْلُواْ عَلَيْهِمْ آيَاتِنَا وَلَكِنَّا كُنَّا مُرْسِلِينَ,but We brought forth generations communities after Moses and life was prolonged in their case in other words they lived long lives and so they forgot the covenants made with God knowledge disappeared and revelation ceased. Then We brought you as Messenger and revealed to you the story of Moses and others. And you were not a dweller a resident among the people of Midian reciting to them Our revelations tatlū ‘alayhim āyātinā a second predicate after thāwiyan ‘dweller’ to know their story and inform of it; but truly We are the senders of you as Messenger and the senders to you of the stories of former generations.
وَمَا كُنْتَ بِجَانِبِ ٱلطُّورِ إِذْ نَادَيْنَا وَلَـٰكِن رَّحْمَةً مِّن رَّبِّكَ لِتُنذِرَ قَوْماً مَّآ أَتَاهُم مِّن نَّذِيرٍ مِّن قَبْلِكَ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَذَكَّرُونَ,And you were not on the side of the Mount when We called out to Moses to take the Scripture earnestly; but We have sent you as a mercy from your Lord that you may warn a people to whom no warner came before you — these are the people of Mecca — and that perhaps they may remember they may be admonished.
وَلَوْلاۤ أَن تُصِيبَهُم مُّصِيبَةٌ بِمَا قَدَّمَتْ أَيْدِيهِمْ فَيَقُولُواْ رَبَّنَا لَوْلاۤ أَرْسَلْتَ إِلَيْنَا رَسُولاً فَنَتَّبِعَ آيَاتِكَ وَنَكُونَ مِنَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,Otherwise if an affliction a punishment should befall them because of what their own hands have sent before them in the way of disbelief and otherwise they might say ‘Our Lord why did You not send a messenger to us that we might have followed Your signs the ones sent with the messengers and been of the believers?’ the response to the conditional particle lawlā ‘if’ has been omitted and what follows it is a new subject; the meaning is ‘were it not for the affliction that is the cause of their saying’ or ‘were it not for their saying that is the cause of their affliction We would have hastened on for them their punishment and We would not have sent you as a messenger to them’.
فَلَمَّا جَآءَهُمُ ٱلْحَقُّ مِنْ عِندِنَا قَالُواْ لَوْلاۤ أُوتِيَ مِثْلَ مَآ أُوتِيَ مُوسَىٰ أَوَلَمْ يَكْفُرُواْ بِمَآ أُوتِيَ مُوسَىٰ مِن قَبْلُ قَالُواْ سِحْرَانِ تَظَاهَرَا وَقَالُواْ إِنَّا بِكُلٍّ كَافِرُونَ,But when the truth namely Muhammad (s) came to them from Us they said ‘Why has he not been given the like of what Moses was given?’ in the way of signs such as the glowing hand the staff and others or by having the Book revealed all at once. God exalted be He says And did they not disbelieve in what was given to Moses before?; before when they said regarding him and Muhammad (s) ‘Two sorcerers sāhirān; a variant reading has sihrān ‘two sorceries’ namely what they said regarding the Qur’ān and the Torah abetting each other.’ And they said ‘We indeed disbelieve in both’ the two prophets and the two Scriptures of Moses and Muhammad.
قُلْ فَأْتُواْ بِكِتَابٍ مِّنْ عِندِ ٱللَّهِ هُوَ أَهْدَىٰ مِنْهُمَآ أَتَّبِعْهُ إِن كُنتُمْ صَادِقِينَ,Say to them ‘Then bring some Scripture from God that is better in guidance than these two Scriptures that I may follow it if you are truthful’ in what you say.
فَإِن لَّمْ يَسْتَجِيبُواْ لَكَ فَٱعْلَمْ أَنَّمَا يَتَّبِعُونَ أَهْوَآءَهُمْ وَمَنْ أَضَلُّ مِمَّنِ ٱتَّبَعَ هَوَاهُ بِغَيْرِ هُدًى مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لاَ يَهْدِي ٱلْقَوْمَ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ,Then if they do not respond to you regarding your invitation to them to bring a Scripture know that they are only following their desires in persisting in their disbelief. And who is more astray than he who follows his desire without any guidance from God? in other words there is no one more astray than such a person. Truly God does not guide the evildoing the disbelieving folk.
وَلَقَدْ وَصَّلْنَا لَهُمُ ٱلْقَوْلَ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَذَكَّرُونَ,And now verily We have brought We have explained to them the Word the Qur’ān that perhaps they might remember they might be admonished and believe.
ٱلَّذِينَ آتَيْنَاهُمُ ٱلْكِتَابَ مِن قَبْلِهِ هُم بِهِ يُؤْمِنُونَ,Those to whom We gave the Scripture before this that is before the Qur’ān they believe in it too. This was revealed regarding certain Jews who became Muslims such as ‘Abd Allāh b. Salām and others and certain Christians who had come from Abyssinia and Syria who also became Muslims.
وَإِذَا يُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْهِمْ قَالُوۤاْ آمَنَّا بِهِ إِنَّهُ ٱلْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّنَآ إنَّا كُنَّا مِن قَبْلِهِ مُسْلِمِينَ,And when it is recited to them the Qur’ān they say ‘We believe in it. It is indeed the Truth from our Lord. Lo! even before it we had submitted’ we affirmed God’s Oneness.
أُوْلَـٰئِكَ يُؤْتُونَ أَجْرَهُم مَّرَّتَيْنِ بِمَا صَبَرُواْ وَيَدْرَؤُنَ بِٱلْحَسَنَةِ ٱلسَّيِّئَةَ وَمِمَّا رَزَقْنَاهُمْ يُنفِقُونَ,Those will be given their reward twice over for believing in both Scriptures for the patience they showed for having been steadfast in implementing the prescriptions in them; and they ward off from themselves evil with good and expend give as voluntary alms of that which We have provided them.
وَإِذَا سَمِعُواْ ٱللَّغْوَ أَعْرَضُواْ عَنْهُ وَقَالُواْ لَنَآ أَعْمَالُنَا وَلَكُمْ أَعْمَالُكُمْ سَلاَمٌ عَلَيْكُمْ لاَ نَبْتَغِي ٱلْجَاهِلِينَ,And when they hear vanity vile words and hurtful intent from the disbelievers they disregard it and say ‘To us belong our deeds and to you belong your deeds. Peace to you — a parting truce salām mutāraka in other words you are secure from any abuse or the like on our part. We do not desire friendship with the ignorant’ we do not seek companionship with them.
إِنَّكَ لاَ تَهْدِي مَنْ أَحْبَبْتَ وَلَـٰكِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَهْدِي مَن يَشَآءُ وَهُوَ أَعْلَمُ بِٱلْمُهْتَدِينَ,The following was revealed regarding the Prophet’s longing for his uncle Abū Tālib to embrace faith You cannot guide whom you like to be guided but it is God Who guides whomever He will and He knows best those who will be guided.
وَقَالُوۤاْ إِن نَّتَّبِعِ ٱلْهُدَىٰ مَعَكَ نُتَخَطَّفْ مِنْ أَرْضِنَآ أَوَلَمْ نُمَكِّن لَّهُمْ حَرَماً آمِناً يُجْبَىٰ إِلَيْهِ ثَمَرَاتُ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ رِّزْقاً مِّن لَّدُنَّا وَلَـٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَهُمْ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ,And they his people say ‘If we were to follow the Guidance with you we will be deprived from our land’ torn out of it swiftly. God exalted be He says Have We not established for them a secure Sanctuary one in which they are secure from the raids and killings that occur among the Arab tribes to which are brought read tujbā or yujbā fruits of all kinds fruits from every direction as a provision for them from Us? But most of them do not know that what We say is the truth.
وَكَمْ أَهْلَكْنَا مِن قَرْيَةٍ بَطِرَتْ مَعِيشَتَهَا فَتِلْكَ مَسَاكِنُهُمْ لَمْ تُسْكَن مِّن بَعْدِهِمْ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً وَكُنَّا نَحْنُ ٱلْوَارِثِينَ,And how many a town We have destroyed whose lifestyle was one of arrogant ungratefulness — by ‘town’ is meant the inhabitants thereof. Those are their dwellings which have not been dwelt in after them except a little by passers-by for a day or part of it. And it was We Who were the sole inheritors after them.
وَمَا كَانَ رَبُّكَ مُهْلِكَ ٱلْقُرَىٰ حَتَّىٰ يَبْعَثَ فِيۤ أُمِّهَا رَسُولاً يَتْلُو عَلَيْهِمْ آيَاتِنَا وَمَا كُنَّا مُهْلِكِي ٱلْقُرَىٰ إِلاَّ وَأَهْلُهَا ظَالِمُونَ,And your Lord never destroyed the towns because of evildoing on their part until He had raised up in their mother-town that is the major town among them a messenger to recite Our signs to them. And We never destroyed the towns unless their inhabitants were committing evil by denying the messengers.
وَمَآ أُوتِيتُم مِّن شَيْءٍ فَمَتَاعُ ٱلْحَيَاةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَزِينَتُهَا وَمَا عِندَ ٱللَّهِ خَيْرٌ وَأَبْقَىٰ أَفَلاَ تَعْقِلُونَ,And whatever things you have been given are only the short-lived enjoyment of the life of this world and an ornament thereof in other words things which you enjoy and adorn yourselves with for the days of your lives after which they perish; and what is with God in other words His reward is better and more lasting. Will you not understand? ta‘qilūna; or read ya‘qilūna ‘will they not understand’ that what lasts is better than what perishes.
أَفَمَن وَعَدْنَاهُ وَعْداً حَسَناً فَهُوَ لاَقِيهِ كَمَن مَّتَّعْنَاهُ مَتَاعَ ٱلْحَيَاةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا ثُمَّ هُوَ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ مِنَ ٱلْمُحْضَرِينَ,Is he to whom We have given a fair promise which he will receive which he will attain and that promise is Paradise like him to whom We have given the enjoyment of the life of this world enjoyment which will disappear soon then on the Day of Resurrection he will be of those arraigned? before the Fire. The former is the believer the latter the disbeliever in other words the two are not equal.
وَيَوْمَ يُنَادِيهِمْ فَيَقُولُ أَيْنَ شُرَكَآئِيَ ٱلَّذِينَ كُنتُمْ تَزْعُمُونَ,And mention the day when He God will call to them and say ‘Where then are My partners those whom you used to claim?’ were partners of Mine.
قَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ حَقَّ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلْقَوْلُ رَبَّنَا هَـٰؤُلاۤءِ ٱلَّذِينَ أَغْوَيْنَآ أَغْوَيْنَاهُمْ كَمَا غَوَيْنَا تَبَرَّأْنَآ إِلَيْكَ مَا كَانُوۤاْ إِيَّانَا يَعْبُدُونَ,Those against whom the Word of punishment will have become due the justified Word that they be admitted into the Fire — and these are the leaders of misguidance — they shall say ‘Our Lord! These are the ones whom we led astray hā’ūlā’i’lladhīna aghwaynā is both a subject and an adjectival qualification. We led them astray aghwaynāhum the predicate thereof and they went astray even as we went astray — we did not compel them to follow error. We declare our innocence of them before You; it was not us that they worshipped’ mā ‘not’ is for negation; the direct object iyyānā ‘us’ precedes the verb ya‘budūna ‘they worshipped’ in order to concord with the end-rhyme of the verses.
وَقِيلَ ٱدْعُواْ شُرَكَآءَكُمْ فَدَعَوْهُمْ فَلَمْ يَسْتَجِيبُواْ لَهُمْ وَرَأَوُاْ ٱلْعَذَابَ لَوْ أَنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ يَهْتَدُونَ,And it shall be said ‘Call now to your associates!’ namely the idols you alleged to be partners of God. So they will call to them but they will not answer them their call and they the former will see they will sight the chastisement they will wish if only they had been guided! in this world they would not have seen it in the Hereafter.
وَيَوْمَ يُنَادِيهِمْ فَيَقُولُ مَاذَآ أَجَبْتُمُ ٱلْمُرْسَلِينَ,And mention the day when He will call to them and say ‘What response did you give to those messengers who were sent?’ to you.
فَعَمِيَتْ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلأَنبَـآءُ يَوْمَئِذٍ فَهُمْ لاَ يَتَسَآءَلُونَ,The tidings the news of deliverance contained in the response will be obscured to them on that day in other words they will not find any statement that might contain hope of deliverance for them; so they will not question one other about this and will fall silent.
فَأَمَّا مَن تَابَ وَآمَنَ وَعَمِلَ صَالِحاً فَعَسَىٰ أَن يَكُونَ مِنَ ٱلْمُفْلِحِينَ,But as for him who repents of idolatry and believes in the affirmation of God’s Oneness and acts righteously he observes the duties of religion maybe he will be among the successful those delivered according to God’s promise.
وَرَبُّكَ يَخْلُقُ مَا يَشَآءُ وَيَخْتَارُ مَا كَانَ لَهُمُ ٱلْخِيَرَةُ سُبْحَانَ ٱللَّهِ وَتَعَالَىٰ عَمَّا يُشْرِكُونَ,And your Lord creates whatever He will and chooses whatever He will. They the idolaters do not have the choice the right to choose anything. Glory be to God and exalted be He above what they associate above their idolatry.
وَرَبُّكَ يَعْلَمُ مَا تُكِنُّ صُدُورُهُمْ وَمَا يُعْلِنُونَ,And your Lord knows what their breasts conceal what their hearts keep secret of disbelief and otherwise and what they proclaim by their tongues of such things.
وَهُوَ ٱللَّهُ لاۤ إِلَـٰهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ لَهُ ٱلْحَمْدُ فِي ٱلأُولَىٰ وَٱلآخِرَةِ وَلَهُ ٱلْحُكْمُ وَإِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ,And He is God; there is no god except Him. To Him belongs all praise in the former namely the life of this world and in the latter Paradise. And to Him belongs the judgement the decree effective in the case of all things and to Him you will be returned through resurrection.
قُلْ أَرَأَيْتُمْ إِن جَعَلَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْكُمُ ٱلْلَّيْلَ سَرْمَداً إِلَىٰ يَوْمِ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ مَنْ إِلَـٰهٌ غَيْرُ ٱللَّهِ يَأْتِيكُمْ بِضِيَآءٍ أَفَلاَ تَسْمَعُونَ,Say to the people of Mecca ‘Have you considered in other words inform Me if God were to make the night everlasting over you until the Day of Resurrection what god other than God as you are wont to claim could bring you light? daylight hours during which you could earn a living. Will you not then listen?’ to this in a way so as to understand it and so repent of your idolatry.
قُلْ أَرَأَيْتُمْ إِن جَعَلَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْكُمُ ٱلنَّهَارَ سَرْمَداً إِلَىٰ يَوْمِ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ مَنْ إِلَـٰهٌ غَيْرُ ٱللَّهِ يَأْتِيكُمْ بِلَيْلٍ تَسْكُنُونَ فِيهِ أَفلاَ تُبْصِرُونَ,Say to them ‘Have you considered if God were to make the day everlasting over you until the Day of Resurrection what god other than God as you are wont to claim could bring you night wherein you rest? from any weariness. Will you not then see? the error you are upon when you ascribe partners to God and so repent of it.
وَمِن رَّحْمَتِهِ جَعَلَ لَكُمُ ٱلَّيلَ وَٱلنَّهَارَ لِتَسْكُنُواْ فِيهِ وَلِتَبتَغُواْ مِن فَضْلِهِ وَلَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ,And of His mercy exalted be He He has made for you night and day that you may rest therein in the night and that you may seek in the day of His bounty to earn your livelihood that perhaps you might give thanks’ for the grace of God during both of these times.
وَيَوْمَ يُنَادِيهِمْ فَيَقُولُ أَيْنَ شُرَكَآئِيَ ٱلَّذِينَ كُنتُمْ تَزْعُمُونَ,And mention the day when He will call to them and say ‘Where now are My associates those whom you used to claim?’ — this is mentioned again in order to expound upon it
وَنَزَعْنَا مِن كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ شَهِيداً فَقُلْنَا هَاتُواْ بُرْهَانَكُمْ فَعَلِمُوۤاْ أَنَّ ٱلْحَقَّ لِلَّهِ وَضَلَّ عَنْهُمْ مَّا كَانُواْ يَفْتَرُونَ,And We shall draw bring forth from every community a witness and this will be their prophet who will bear witness against what they say and We shall say to them ‘Produce your evidence’ for the justification of the idolatry which you asserted. Then they will know that the right to divineness is God’s — none share it with Him. And that which they used to invent in this world of His having an associate exalted be He high above such associations will fail them.
إِنَّ قَارُونَ كَانَ مِن قَوْمِ مُوسَىٰ فَبَغَىٰ عَلَيْهِمْ وَآتَيْنَاهُ مِنَ ٱلْكُنُوزِ مَآ إِنَّ مَفَاتِحَهُ لَتَنُوءُ بِٱلْعُصْبَةِ أُوْلِي ٱلْقُوَّةِ إِذْ قَالَ لَهُ قَوْمُهُ لاَ تَفْرَحْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لاَ يُحِبُّ ٱلْفَرِحِينَ,Indeed Korah belonged to the people of Moses — being his paternal and maternal cousin and he had believed in him in Moses — but he became insolent towards them through his disdain haughtiness and great wealth. For We had given him so many treasures that the number of their keys would verily have burdened a group of strong men in other words they would have been too heavy for such men the bā’ of bi’l-‘usbati ‘a group’ is to render transitive the intransitive verb; the number of such men required is estimated to be 70 40 or 10; other estimates are also given. Mention when his people the believers among the Children of Israel said to him ‘Do not be exultant in your great wealth an exultation of insolence; truly God does not love the exultant in such things;
وَٱبْتَغِ فِيمَآ آتَاكَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلدَّارَ ٱلآخِرَةَ وَلاَ تَنسَ نَصِيبَكَ مِنَ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَأَحْسِن كَمَآ أَحْسَنَ ٱللَّهُ إِلَيْكَ وَلاَ تَبْغِ ٱلْفَسَادَ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لاَ يُحِبُّ ٱلْمُفْسِدِينَ,but seek in that which God has given you of wealth the Abode of the Hereafter by expending it in obedience to God and do not forget your share of this world that is do not forget to strive in it for the sake of the Hereafter; and be good to people by giving voluntary alms just as God has been good to you. And do not seek to cause corruption in the earth by committing acts of disobedience. Surely God does not love the agents of corruption’ meaning that He will punish them.
قَالَ إِنَّمَآ أُوتِيتُهُ عَلَىٰ عِلْمٍ عِندِيۤ أَوَلَمْ يَعْلَمْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ قَدْ أَهْلَكَ مِن قَبْلِهِ مِنَ ٱلْقُرُونِ مَنْ هُوَ أَشَدُّ مِنْهُ قُوَّةً وَأَكْثَرُ جَمْعاً وَلاَ يُسْأَلُ عَن ذُنُوبِهِمُ ٱلْمُجْرِمُونَ,He said ‘In fact I have been given it that is this wealth because of knowledge I possess’ in other words in return for it — he was the most knowledgeable of the Children of Israel in the Torah after Moses and Aaron. God exalted be He says Does he not know that God had already destroyed before him generations communities of men stronger than him in might and greater in the amassing? of wealth; in other words he does know this. And God destroys them and the guilty will not be questioned about their sins because of God’s knowledge of these sins and so they will be admitted into the Fire without a reckoning.
فَخَرَجَ عَلَىٰ قَوْمِهِ فِي زِينَتِهِ قَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ يُرِيدُونَ ٱلْحَيَاةَ ٱلدُّنْيَا يٰلَيْتَ لَنَا مِثْلَ مَآ أُوتِيَ قَارُونُ إِنَّهُ لَذُو حَظٍّ عَظِيمٍ,So he Korah emerged before his people in his finery with his large retinue all of them in procession dressed in gold and silk garments and mounted on adorned horses and mules. Those who desired the life of this world said ‘O yā is for drawing attention would that we had the like of what Korah has been given this world. Truly he enjoys great fortune’ abundant fortune in it.
وَقَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ ٱلْعِلْمَ وَيْلَكُمْ ثَوَابُ ٱللَّهِ خَيْرٌ لِّمَنْ آمَنَ وَعَمِلَ صَالِحاً وَلاَ يُلَقَّاهَآ إِلاَّ ٱلصَّابِرُونَ,But those to whom knowledge had been given knowledge of what God had promised in the Hereafter said to them ‘Woe to you! waylakum is an expression of reprimand God’s reward of Paradise in the Hereafter is better for him who believes and acts righteously than what Korah has been given in this world; and none will obtain it namely the Paradise that is given as a reward except those who are steadfast’ in their adherence to obedience and refrain from disobedience.
فَخَسَفْنَا بِهِ وَبِدَارِهِ ٱلأَرْضَ فَمَا كَانَ لَهُ مِن فِئَةٍ يَنصُرُونَهُ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ وَمَا كَانَ مِنَ ٱلْمُنتَصِرِينَ,So We caused the earth to swallow him Korah and his dwelling and he had no host to help him besides God that is other than Him to protect him from destruction nor was he of those who can rescue themselves from it.
وَأَصْبَحَ ٱلَّذِينَ تَمَنَّوْاْ مَكَانَهُ بِٱلأَمْسِ يَقُولُونَ وَيْكَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَبْسُطُ ٱلرِّزْقَ لِمَن يَشَآءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ وَيَقْدِرُ لَوْلاۤ أَن مَّنَّ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْنَا لَخَسَفَ بِنَا وَيْكَأَنَّهُ لاَ يُفْلِحُ ٱلْكَافِرُونَ,And those who had longed to be in his place the day before that is only recently were saying ‘Alas! God expands provision for whomever He will of His servants and straitens it He restricts it for whomever He will way-ka’anna way is a noun of action with the sense of ‘How astonished I am’ while the kāf functions as a causative lām ‘because’. Had God not been gracious to us He would have made us to be swallowed too’ read active la-khasafa or passive la-khusifa. Lo! indeed those who are ungrateful for God’s grace such as Korah never prosper.
تِلْكَ ٱلدَّارُ ٱلآخِرَةُ نَجْعَلُهَا لِلَّذِينَ لاَ يُرِيدُونَ عُلُوّاً فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَلاَ فَسَاداً وَٱلْعَاقِبَةُ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ,That is the Abode of the Hereafter namely Paradise which We shall grant to those who do not desire to be haughty in the earth through insolence nor to cause corruption by committing acts of disobedience. And the praiseworthy sequel will be for those who fear God’s punishment by performing deeds of obedience.
مَن جَآءَ بِٱلْحَسَنَةِ فَلَهُ خَيْرٌ مِّنْهَا وَمَن جَآءَ بِٱلسَّيِّئَةِ فَلاَ يُجْزَى ٱلَّذِينَ عَمِلُواْ ٱلسَّيِّئَاتِ إِلاَّ مَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ,Whoever brings a good deed shall have better than it as a reward because of it and this will be the like of it tenfold; while whoever brings an evil deed those who commit evil deeds shall only be requited the requital for what they used to do in other words only the like of it.
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِي فَرَضَ عَلَيْكَ ٱلْقُرْآنَ لَرَآدُّكَ إِلَىٰ مَعَادٍ قُل رَّبِّيۤ أَعْلَمُ مَن جَآءَ بِٱلْهُدَىٰ وَمَنْ هُوَ فِي ضَلاَلٍ مُّبِينٍ,Indeed He Who has prescribed for you the Qur’ān He Who has revealed it will surely restore you to a place of return to Mecca — he had yearned for it. Say ‘My Lord knows best him who brings guidance and him who is in manifest error’ — this was revealed in order to refute what the Meccan disbelievers had said to him ‘Indeed you are error’. In other words God is saying that he the Prophet is the one who has brought guidance while they are the ones in error.
وَمَا كُنتَ تَرْجُوۤ أَن يُلْقَىٰ إِلَيْكَ ٱلْكِتَابُ إِلاَّ رَحْمَةً مِّن رَّبِّكَ فَلاَ تَكُونَنَّ ظَهيراً لِّلْكَافِرِينَ,And you never expected that the Scripture the Qur’ān would be conferred on you; but it was conferred on you as a mercy from your Lord. So never be a supporter of the disbelievers in that religion of theirs to which they summon you.
وَلاَ يَصُدُّنَّكَ عَنْ آيَاتِ ٱللَّهِ بَعْدَ إِذْ أُنزِلَتْ إِلَيْكَ وَٱدْعُ إِلَىٰ رَبِّكَ وَلاَ تَكُونَنَّ مِنَ ٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ,And never let them bar you yasuddunnaka is actually yasuddūnannaka but the nūn of the indicative ending has been omitted because of the apocopating particle lā as has the wāw of the third person plural subject of the verb because of its coming together with an unvocalised nūn from God’s signs after they have been revealed to you in other words do not consult with them in such matters and summon people to your Lord by affirming His Oneness and worshipping Him and never be of the idolaters by supporting them lā takūnanna the apocopating particle does not affect the ending of the verb here because of its invariability.
وَلاَ تَدْعُ مَعَ ٱللَّهِ إِلَـٰهاً آخَرَ لاَ إِلَـٰهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ كُلُّ شَيْءٍ هَالِكٌ إِلاَّ وَجْهَهُ لَهُ ٱلْحُكْمُ وَإِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ,And do not call on do not worship another god with God; there is no god except Him. Everything will perish except His Countenance except Him. His is the judgement the effective decree and to Him you will be brought back by being raised from the grave.
الۤـمۤ,Alif lām mīm God knows best what He means by these letters.
أَحَسِبَ ٱلنَّاسُ أَن يُتْرَكُوۤاْ أَن يَقُولُوۤاْ آمَنَّا وَهُمْ لاَ يُفْتَنُونَ,Do people suppose that they will be left to say that is that they will be left alone because of their saying ‘We believe’ and they will not be tried? tested with that which will reveal the sincerity of their belief. This verse was revealed regarding a group of individuals who when they became believers endured suffering at the hands of the idolaters.
وَلَقَدْ فَتَنَّا ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ فَلَيَعْلَمَنَّ ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِينَ صَدَقُواْ وَلَيَعْلَمَنَّ ٱلْكَاذِبِينَ,And certainly We tried those who were before them. So God shall surely know those who are sincere in their faith — a knowledge of direct vision — and He shall surely know those who are liars regarding it.
أَمْ حَسِبَ ٱلَّذِينَ يَعْمَلُونَ ٱلسَّيِّئَاتِ أَن يَسْبِقُونَا سَآءَ مَا يَحْكُمُونَ,Or do those who commit evil deeds idolatry and acts of disobedience suppose that they can elude Us? so that We will not be able to requite them. Evil is that judgement of theirs which they judge!
مَن كَانَ يَرْجُواْ لِقَآءَ ٱللَّهِ فَإِنَّ أَجَلَ ٱللَّهِ لآتٍ وَهُوَ ٱلسَّمِيعُ ٱلْعَلِيمُ,Whoever expects to encounter God should know that God’s appointed term for this encounter will indeed come; so let him prepare for it. And He is the Hearer of the sayings of His servants the Knower of their actions.
وَمَن جَاهَدَ فَإِنَّمَا يُجَاهِدُ لِنَفْسِهِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَغَنِيٌّ عَنِ ٱلْعَالَمِينَ,And whoever struggles in war or against the temptations of his own soul struggles only for his own sake because the benefits to be reaped from his struggle will be for his sake and not for God’s. For truly God is Independent of the creatures of all the Worlds mankind jinn and angels and He is also without need of their worship.
وَٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ لَنُكَفِّرَنَّ عَنْهُمْ سَيِّئَاتِهِمْ وَلَنَجْزِيَنَّهُمْ أَحْسَنَ ٱلَّذِي كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ,And those who believe and perform righteous deeds We will surely absolve them of their misdeeds by their performance of righteous deeds and We will indeed requite them with the best of what they used to do namely their righteous deeds it ahsana is in the accusative because the operator of the oblique bi has been omitted.
وَوَصَّيْنَا ٱلإِنْسَانَ بِوَالِدَيْهِ حُسْناً وَإِن جَاهَدَاكَ لِتُشْرِكَ بِي مَا لَيْسَ لَكَ بِهِ عِلْمٌ فَلاَ تُطِعْهُمَآ إِلَيَّ مَرْجِعُكُمْ فَأُنَبِّئُكُم بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ,And We have enjoined on man kindness to his parents that he should be dutiful towards them; but if they urge you to ascribe to Me as partner that of which you do not have any knowledge any knowledge that accords with reality and so is meaningless then do not obey them in such incitements to idolatry. To Me will be your return whereat I will inform you of what you used to do and I will requite you for it.
وَٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ لَنُدْخِلَنَّهُمْ فِي ٱلصَّالِحِينَ,And those who believe and perform righteous deeds assuredly We shall admit them among the righteous among the prophets and the saints by gathering in the company of one another at the Resurrection.
وَمِنَ ٱلنَّاسِ مَن يِقُولُ ءَامَنَّا بِٱللَّهِ فَإِذَآ أُوذِيَ فِي ٱللَّهِ جَعَلَ فِتْنَةَ ٱلنَّاسِ كَعَذَابِ ٱللَّهِ وَلَئِنْ جَآءَ نَصْرٌ مِّن رَّبِّكَ لَيَقُولُنَّ إِنَّا كُنَّا مَعَكُمْ أَوَ لَيْسَ ٱللَّهُ بِأَعْلَمَ بِمَا فِي صُدُورِ ٱلْعَالَمِينَ,And among people there are those who say ‘We believe in God’ but if such a person suffers hurt in God’s cause he takes people’s persecution that is their harming of him to be the same as God’s chastisement in terms of his fear of it and so he obeys them and behaves hypocritically. Yet if la-in the lām is for oaths there comes help to believers from your Lord and they take spoils they will assuredly say la-yaqūlunna the final nūn of the indicative has been omitted because of the other nūn coming after it and likewise the wāw indicating the plural person has been replaced by a damma because of two unvocalised consonants coming together ‘We were indeed with you’ in faith so give us a share of the booty. God exalted be He says Does God not know best what is in the breasts of all creatures? what is in their hearts of faith or hypocrisy? Indeed He does.
وَلَيَعْلَمَنَّ ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَلَيَعْلَمَنَّ ٱلْمُنَافِقِينَ,And God shall surely ascertain those who believe in their hearts and He shall surely ascertain the hypocrites and He will requite each group accordingly the lām in both verbs la-ya‘lamanna ‘He shall ascertain’ is for oaths.
وَقَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لِلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ ٱتَّبِعُواْ سَبِيلَنَا وَلْنَحْمِلْ خَطَايَاكُمْ وَمَا هُمْ بِحَامِلِينَ مِنْ خَطَايَاهُمْ مِّن شَيْءٍ إِنَّهُمْ لَكَاذِبُونَ,And those who disbelieve say to those who believe ‘Follow our path our religion and we will bear responsibility for your sins’ when you follow us should there be any such sins the imperative here functions as a predicate. God exalted be He says But they will not be able to bear anything of their sins. Truly they are liars in saying this.
وَلَيَحْمِلُنَّ أَثْقَالَهُمْ وَأَثْقَالاً مَّعَ أَثْقَالِهِمْ وَلَيُسْأَلُنَّ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ عَمَّا كَانُواْ يَفْتَرُونَ,And they shall certainly bear their own burdens their sins and other burdens along with their own burdens as punishment for saying to believers Follow our path previous verse and for their leading astray those who follow them blindly; and on the Day of Resurrection they shall surely be questioned concerning what they used to invent what they used to fabricate of lies against God a questioning of rebuke the lām in both verbs la-yahmilunna and la-yus’alunna is for oaths; in both verbs the plural indicators of the subject wāw and nūn -ūna have been omitted.
وَلَقَدْ أَرْسَلْنَا نُوحاً إِلَىٰ قَوْمِهِ فَلَبِثَ فِيهِمْ أَلْفَ سَنَةٍ إِلاَّ خَمْسِينَ عَاماً فَأَخَذَهُمُ ٱلطُّوفَانُ وَهُمْ ظَالِمُونَ,And verily We sent Noah to his people when he was forty years of age or older and he remained among them a thousand-less-fifty years calling them to affirm God’s Oneness but they denied him; so the Flood engulfed them a deluge of water drifted against them rising above them and drowning them for they were wrongdoers idolaters.
فأَنْجَيْناهُ وأَصْحَابَ ٱلسَّفِينَةِ وَجَعَلْنَاهَآ آيَةً لِّلْعَالَمِينَ,Then We delivered him namely Noah and the occupants of the ship those who were with him in it and We made this a sign a lesson for all peoples for all peoples that would come after them should they disobey the messengers sent to them. Noah lived for a further sixty years or more after the Flood until mankind multiplied again.
وَإِبْرَاهِيمَ إِذْ قَالَ لِقَوْمِهِ ٱعْبُدُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَٱتَّقُوهُ ذٰلِكُمْ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ,And mention Abraham when he said to his people ‘Worship God and fear Him fear His punishment; that is better for you than the worship of idols which you practice if you only knew what is good from what is otherwise.
إِنَّمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ أَوْثَاناً وَتَخْلُقُونَ إِفْكاً إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ لاَ يَمْلِكُونَ لَكُمْ رِزْقاً فَٱبْتَغُواْ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرِّزْقَ وَٱعْبُدُوهُ وَٱشْكُرُواْ لَهُ إِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ,What you worship besides God that is other than Him are only graven images and you fabricate a calumny you speak lies such as ‘These graven images are God’s partners’. Truly those whom you worship besides God have no power to provide for you. So seek your provision from God request it from Him and worship Him and be thankful to Him; to Him you shall be returned.
وَإِن تُكَذِّبُواْ فَقَدْ كَذَّبَ أُمَمٌ مِّن قَبْلِكُمْ وَمَا عَلَى ٱلرَّسُولِ إِلاَّ ٱلْبَلاَغُ ٱلْمُبِينُ,But if you deny that is if you deny me O people of Mecca then many communities have denied before you that is before my time; and the messenger’s duty is only to communicate the Message clearly’. Both stories are meant to comfort the Prophet s. And regarding his people God exalted be He says
أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْاْ كَيْفَ يُبْدِئُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْخَلْقَ ثُمَّ يُعِيدُهُ إِنَّ ذٰلِكَ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ يَسِيرٌ,Have they not seen yaraw or taraw ‘have you not seen?’ observed how God originates creation yubdi’u from 4th form abda’a; a variant reading has yabda‘u from 1st form bada’a both with the same meaning ‘He creates them originally’ then He restores it namely creation just as He originated them? Surely that which is mentioned of the first and the second acts of creation is easy for God so how can they deny the second one?
قُلْ سِيرُواْ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ فَٱنظُرُواْ كَيْفَ بَدَأَ ٱلْخَلْقَ ثُمَّ ٱللَّهُ يُنشِىءُ ٱلنَّشْأَةَ ٱلآخِرَةَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,Say ‘Travel in the land and observe how He originated creation of those before you and how He made them die. Then God shall bring about the other genesis al-nashā’a or al-nash’a. Truly God has power over all things among them the origination of creation and the restoration thereof.
يُعَذِّبُ مَن يَشَآءُ وَيَرْحَمُ مَن يَشَآءُ وَإِلَيْهِ تُقْلَبُونَ,He chastises whomever He will to chastise and has mercy on whomever He will to have mercy and to Him you shall be returned.
وَمَآ أَنتُمْ بِمُعْجِزِينَ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَلاَ فِي ٱلسَّمَآءِ وَمَا لَكُمْ مِّن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ مِن وَلِيٍّ وَلاَ نَصِيرٍ,And you will never be able to thwart Him your Lord and prevent Him from catching up with you on earth or in the heaven were you to be in it in other words you cannot elude Him; and you do not have besides God that is other than Him any guardian to defend you against Him or any helper to help you escape from His chastisement.
وَٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ بِآيَاتِ ٱللَّهِ وَلِقَآئِهِ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ يَئِسُواْ مِن رَّحْمَتِي وَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,And those who disbelieve in God’s signs and the encounter with Him namely the Qur’ān and the Resurrection respectively they have despaired of My mercy that is of attaining My Paradise and for those there shall be a painful chastisement.
فَمَا كَانَ جَوَابَ قَوْمِهِ إِلاَّ أَن قَالُواْ ٱقْتُلُوهُ أَوْ حَرِّقُوهُ فَأَنْجَاهُ ٱللَّهُ مِنَ ٱلنَّارِ إِنَّ فِي ذٰلِكَ لآيَاتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يُؤْمِنُونَ,God exalted be He says with regard to the tale of Abraham peace be upon him But the only answer of his people was that they said ‘Slay him or burn him!’ Then God delivered him from the fire into which they threw him by making it cool and harmless for him. Surely in that namely in that deliverance of him from it there are signs — namely the fact that it did not have any affect on him despite its greatness and the fact that it was extinguished and that within a brief period meadows sprung up in its place — for a people who believe a people who affirm the truth of God’s Oneness and His power for they are the ones to benefit from these signs.
وَقَالَ إِنَّمَا ٱتَّخَذْتُمْ مِّن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ أَوْثَاناً مَّوَدَّةَ بَيْنِكُمْ فِي ٱلْحَيَاةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا ثُمَّ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ يَكْفُرُ بَعْضُكُمْ بِبَعْضٍ وَيَلْعَنُ بَعْضُكُمْ بَعْضاً وَمَأْوَاكُمُ ٱلنَّارُ وَمَا لَكُمْ مِّن نَّاصِرِينَ,And he Abraham said ‘You have adopted mere idols besides God which you worship mā of innamā relates to the verbal noun for the sake of mutual affection between you mawaddatu baynikum this is the predicate of inna of innamā; the accusative reading mawaddata baynikum would denote a direct object denoting reason so that the mā would denote ‘entirety’ — in other words you are friends of one another in your worship of them in the life of this world. Then on the Day of Resurrection you will disown one another the leaders will dissociate from those who followed them; and you will curse one another those who followed will curse their leaders; and your abode your destination all together will be the Fire and you will have no helpers’ to protect you against it.
فَآمَنَ لَهُ لُوطٌ وَقَالَ إِنِّي مُهَاجِرٌ إِلَىٰ رَبِّيۤ إِنَّهُ هُوَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ,And Lot believed in him he affirmed the sincerity of Abraham and he was his paternal nephew from his brother Hārān and he Abraham said ‘Indeed I am migrating away from my people toward my Lord to where my Lord commands. So he shunned his people and emigrated from the rural lands of Iraq to Syria. Indeed He is the Mighty in His kingdom the Wise’ in what He does.
وَوَهَبْنَا لَهُ إِسْحَاقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ وَجَعَلْنَا فِي ذُرِّيَّتِهِ ٱلنُّبُوَّةَ وَٱلْكِتَابَ وَآتَيْنَاهُ أَجْرَهُ فِي ٱلدُّنْيَا وَإِنَّهُ فِي ٱلآخِرَةِ لَمِنَ ٱلصَّالِحِينَ,And We gave him after Ishmael Isaac and Jacob after Isaac; and We ordained among his descendants prophethood thus all prophets after Abraham are descended from him and the Scripture meaning the Holy Books the Torah the Gospels the Psalms and the Criterion al-furqān. And We gave him his reward in this world which is fair praise of him by members of all the Abrahamic religions. And in the Hereafter he shall truly be among the righteous for whom there shall be the highest degrees of reward.
وَلُوطاً إِذْ قَالَ لِقَوْمِهِ إِنَّكُمْ لَتَأْتُونَ ٱلْفَاحِشَةَ مَا سَبَقَكُمْ بِهَا مِنْ أَحَدٍ مِّنَ ٱلْعَالَمِينَ,And mention Lot when he said to his people ‘Truly you read a-innakum pronouncing both hamzas or not pronouncing the second and inserting an alif between the two in either case and in both instances commit lewdness namely coming in unto the rears of men such as none in all the worlds of jinn or men has committed before you.
أَئِنَّكُمْ لَتَأْتُونَ ٱلرِّجَالَ وَتَقْطَعُونَ ٱلسَّبِيلَ وَتَأْتُونَ فِي نَادِيكُمُ ٱلْمُنْكَرَ فَمَا كَانَ جَوَابَ قَوْمِهِ إِلاَّ أَن قَالُواْ ٱئْتِنَا بِعَذَابِ ٱللَّهِ إِن كُنتَ مِنَ ٱلصَّادِقِينَ,What! Do you come unto men and cut off the way the travel roads of passers-by committing lewd acts with whoever passes your way such that people ceased to pass by where you live and you discuss in your gatherings in your conversations indecency?’ you discuss committing lewd acts with one another. But the only answer of his people was that they said ‘Bring us the chastisement of God if you are truthful’ in your deeming such acts vile and that chastisement will befall those who do such things.
قَالَ رَبِّ ٱنصُرْنِي عَلَى ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلْمُفْسِدِينَ,He said ‘My Lord help me by making that of which I spoke come true regarding the sending down of chastisement against the people who work corruption’ those who are disobedient by coming unto men. So God answered his call.
وَلَمَّا جَآءَتْ رُسُلُنَآ إِبْرَاهِيمَ بِٱلْبُشْرَىٰ قَالُوۤاْ إِنَّا مُهْلِكُوۤ أَهْلِ هَـٰذِهِ ٱلْقَرْيَةِ إِنَّ أَهْلَهَا كَانُواْ ظَالِمِينَ,And when Our messengers came to Abraham with the good tidings of Isaac and Jacob after him they said ‘We shall assuredly destroy the people of this town namely the town of Lot for truly its people are evildoers’ disbelievers.
قَالَ إِنَّ فِيهَا لُوطاً قَالُواْ نَحْنُ أَعْلَمُ بِمَن فِيهَا لَنُنَجِّيَنَّهُ وَأَهْلَهُ إِلاَّ ٱمْرَأَتَهُ كَانَتْ مِنَ ٱلْغَابِرِينَ,He Abraham said ‘Lo! Lot is in it.’ They namely the messengers said ‘We know very well who is in it. Assuredly We shall deliver him read la-nunjiyannahu or la-nunajjiyannahu and his family except his wife she is of those who will stay behind’ of those who will remain behind in the chastisement.
وَلَمَّآ أَن جَآءَتْ رُسُلُنَا لُوطاً سِيءَ بِهِمْ وَضَاقَ بِهِمْ ذَرْعاً وَقَالُواْ لاَ تَخَفْ وَلاَ تَحْزَنْ إِنَّا مُنَجُّوكَ وَأَهْلَكَ إِلاَّ ٱمْرَأَتَكَ كَانَتْ مِنَ ٱلْغَابِرينَ,And when Our messengers came to Lot he was distressed on their account he was grieved because of them and he was constrained unable to help them because they had handsome faces dressed as guests and thus he feared for them from his people. So they informed him that they were the messengers of his Lord. But they said ‘Do not be afraid nor grieve. We shall surely deliver you read munajjūka or munjūka and your family except your wife she is of those who will remain behind ahlaka ‘your family’ is in the accusative as a supplement to the suffixed direct object pronoun kāf of munajjūka ‘We shall surely deliver you’.
إِنَّا مُنزِلُونَ عَلَىٰ أَهْلِ هَـٰذِهِ ٱلْقَرْيَةِ رِجْزاً مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ بِمَا كَانُواْ يَفْسُقُونَ,We are indeed going to bring down read munzilūna or munazzilūna upon the people of this town a scourge a chastisement from the heaven because of on account of the acts of their immorality’.
وَلَقَد تَّرَكْنَا مِنْهَآ آيَةً بَيِّنَةً لِّقَوْمٍ يَعْقِلُونَ,And verily We have left of that a clear sign a manifest one — namely the remains of its the town’s ruins — for a people who understand a people who reflect.
وَإِلَىٰ مَدْيَنَ أَخَاهُمْ شُعَيْباً فَقَالَ يٰقَوْمِ ٱعْبُدُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَٱرْجُواْ ٱلْيَوْمَ ٱلأَخِرَ وَلاَ تَعْثَوْاْ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ مُفْسِدِينَ,And We sent to Midian their brother Shu‘ayb. He said ‘O my people! Worship God and anticipate the Last Day fear it namely the Day of Resurrection; and do not be degenerate in the earth working corruption’ mufsidīna is a circumstantial qualifier emphasising its operator wa-lā ta‘thaw ‘do not be degenerate’; it the verb derives from ‘athiya meaning afsada ‘he corrupted’.
فَكَذَّبُوهُ فَأَخَذَتْهُمُ ٱلرَّجْفَةُ فَأَصْبَحُواْ فِي دَارِهِمْ جَاثِمِينَ,But they denied him and so the earthquake the violent tremor seized them and they ended up lying lifeless prostrate in their habitations keeled over their knees dead.
وَعَاداً وَثَمُودَاْ وَقَد تَّبَيَّنَ لَكُم مِّن مَّسَاكِنِهِمْ وَزَيَّنَ لَهُمُ ٱلشَّيْطَانُ أَعْمَالَهُمْ فَصَدَّهُمْ عَنِ ٱلسَّبِيلِ وَكَانُواْ مُسْتَبْصِرِينَ,And We destroyed ‘Ād and Thamūd may be fully declined or not as diptotes denoting both the district or the tribe respectively— it is indeed evident to you their destruction from their former dwellings in al-Hijr and in Yemen. For Satan adorned for them their deeds of disbelief and disobedience and thus barred them from the Way the way of truth though they had been discerning perceptive people.
وَقَارُونَ وَفِرْعَوْنَ وَهَامَانَ وَلَقَدْ جَآءَهُمْ مُّوسَىٰ بِٱلْبَيِّنَاتِ فَٱسْتَكْبَرُواْ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَمَا كَانُواْ سَابِقِينَ,And We destroyed Korah and Pharaoh and Hāmān! And verily Moses brought them beforehand clear signs manifest proofs but they acted arrogantly in the land; and they could not thwart Us they could not elude Our chastisement.
فَكُلاًّ أَخَذْنَا بِذَنبِهِ فَمِنْهُم مَّن أَرْسَلْنَا عَلَيْهِ حَاصِباً وَمِنْهُمْ مَّنْ أَخَذَتْهُ ٱلصَّيْحَةُ وَمِنْهُمْ مَّنْ خَسَفْنَا بِهِ ٱلأَرْضَ وَمِنْهُمْ مَّنْ أَغْرَقْنَا وَمَا كَانَ ٱللَّهُ لِيَظْلِمَهُمْ وَلَـٰكِن كَانُوۤاْ أَنفُسَهُمْ يَظْلِمُونَ,So each of those mentioned We seized for his sin; and among them were some upon whom We unleashed a squall of stones as in the case of the people of Lot and among them were some who were seized by the Cry such as Thamūd and among them were some whom We made the earth swallow such as Korah and among them were some whom We drowned like the people of Noah Pharaoh and his people. And God never wronged them by chastising them for having committed no sin but they wronged themselves by committing sins.
مَثَلُ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱتَّخَذُواْ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ أَوْلِيَآءَ كَمَثَلِ ٱلْعَنكَبُوتِ ٱتَّخَذَتْ بَيْتاً وَإِنَّ أَوْهَنَ ٱلْبُيُوتِ لَبَيْتُ ٱلْعَنكَبُوتِ لَوْ كَانُواْ يَعْلَمُونَ,The likeness of those who choose besides God other patrons namely idols from whom they hope to profit is as the likeness of the spider that makes a home for itself in which to shelter. And truly the frailest the weakest of homes is the home of the spider for it neither protects it from heat nor cold — likewise idols cannot benefit those who worship them — if they only knew this they would not worship them.
إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَعْلَمُ مَا يَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِهِ مِن شَيْءٍ وَهُوَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ,Truly God knows whatever thing mā functions like alladhī they call on what they worship read yad‘ūna ‘they call on’ or tad‘ūna ‘you call on’ besides Him other than Him. And He is the Mighty in His kingdom the Wise in what He does.
وَتِلْكَ ٱلأَمْثَالُ نَضْرِبُهَا لِلنَّاسِ وَمَا يَعْقِلُهَآ إِلاَّ ٱلْعَالِمُونَ,And such similitudes in the Qur’ān We strike them We coin them for the sake of mankind; but none understands them none grasp them except those who know those who reflect.
خَلَقَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضَ بِٱلْحَقِّ إِنَّ فِي ذٰلِكَ لآيَةً لِّلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,God created the heavens and the earth with truth that is rightly. Surely in that there is a sign indicating His power exalted be He for believers — they are specifically mentioned because they are the ones to benefit thereby in their faith in contrast to disbelievers.
ٱتْلُ مَا أُوْحِيَ إِلَيْكَ مِنَ ٱلْكِتَابِ وَأَقِمِ ٱلصَّلاَةَ إِنَّ ٱلصَّلاَةَ تَنْهَىٰ عَنِ ٱلْفَحْشَآءِ وَٱلْمُنْكَرِ وَلَذِكْرُ ٱللَّهِ أَكْبَرُ وَٱللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ مَا تَصْنَعُونَ,Recite what has been revealed to you of the Book the Qur’ān and maintain prayer; truly prayer prohibits lewd acts and indecency defined as such according to the Law. In other words that is its purpose provided that the person adheres to observance of it. And the remembrance of God is surely greater than other acts of obedience and God knows what you do and He will requite you for them.
وَلاَ تُجَادِلُوۤاْ أَهْلَ ٱلْكِتَابِ إِلاَّ بِٱلَّتِي هِيَ أَحْسَنُ إِلاَّ ٱلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ مِنْهُمْ وَقُولُوۤاْ آمَنَّا بِٱلَّذِيۤ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْنَا وَأُنزِلَ إِلَيْكُمْ وَإِلَـٰهُنَا وَإِلَـٰهُكُمْ وَاحِدٌ وَنَحْنُ لَهُ مُسْلِمُونَ,And do not dispute with the People of the Scripture unless it be with that — in that manner of disputation bettering the most virtuous way such as calling them to God by reference to His signs and pointing out His arguments; except in the case of those of them who have done wrong by waging war and refusing to accept to pay the jizya-tax dispute with these using the sword until such time as they submit or pay the jizya-tax; and say to those who have accepted the imposition upon them of the jizya-tax should they inform you of something stated in their Scriptures ‘We believe in that which has been revealed to us and revealed to you — and neither believe nor disbelieve them in that which they tell you — our God and your God is one and the same and to Him we submit’ to Him we are obedient.
وَكَذَلِكَ أَنزَلْنَآ إِلَيْكَ ٱلْكِتَابَ فَٱلَّذِينَ آتَيْنَاهُمُ ٱلْكِتَابَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِهِ وَمِنْ هَـٰؤُلاۤءِ مَن يُؤْمِنُ بِهِ وَمَا يَجْحَدُ بِآيَاتِنَآ إِلاَّ ٱلْكَافِرونَ,Thus have We revealed to you the Book the Qur’ān in the same way that We have revealed to them the Torah and other scripture. And so those to whom We have given the Scripture the Torah such as ‘Abd Allāh b. Salām and others believe in it in the Qur’ān and of these people of Mecca there are some who believe in it; and none denies Our signs after they have been manifested except disbelievers namely the Jews and those for whom it was apparent that the Qur’ān was the truth and that the one who brought it was truthful but still denied it.
وَمَا كُنتَ تَتْلُواْ مِن قَبْلِهِ مِن كِتَابٍ وَلاَ تَخُطُّهُ بِيَمِينِكَ إِذاً لاَّرْتَابَ ٱلْمُبْطِلُونَ,And you did not use to recite before this namely before the Qur’ān any other Book nor did you write it with your right hand for had you been reciting something and writing then those who follow falsehood the Jews would have had doubts about you and would have said ‘What the Torah states is that he will be unlettered ummī unable to read or write’.
بَلْ هُوَ آيَاتٌ بَيِّنَاتٌ فِي صُدُورِ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ ٱلْعِلْمَ وَمَا يَجْحَدُ بِآيَاتِنَآ إِلاَّ ٱلظَّالِمُونَ,Nay but it that is the Qur’ān which you have brought is clear signs in the breasts of those who have been given knowledge namely the believers who preserve it in their hearts and none denies Our signs except wrongdoers namely the Jews — they denied them after they were manifested to them.
وَقَالُواْ لَوْلاَ أُنزِلَ عَلَيْهِ آيَاتٌ مِّن رَّبِّهِ قُلْ إِنَّمَا ٱلآيَاتُ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ وَإِنَّمَآ أَنَاْ نَذِيرٌ مُّبِينٌ,And they namely the disbelievers of Mecca say ‘Why has not some sign been sent down to him to Muhammad (s) from his Lord?’ āyatun ‘sign’ a variant reading has āyātun ‘signs’ such as the she-camel of Sālih or the staff of Moses or the Table of Jesus. Say to them ‘Signs are only with God and He sends them down as He will and I am only a plain warner’ making manifest my warning of the punishment of the Fire for disobedient people.
أَوَلَمْ يَكْفِهِمْ أَنَّآ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْكَ ٱلْكِتَابَ يُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْهِمْ إِنَّ فِي ذٰلِكَ لَرَحْمَةً وَذِكْرَىٰ لِقَوْمٍ يُؤْمِنُونَ,Is it not sufficient for them regarding what they have demanded that We have revealed to you the Book the Qur’ān which is recited to them? — as it constitutes a ongoing sign that will never terminate in contrast to the signs mentioned. Surely in that Book is mercy and a reminder an admonition for a people who believe.
قُلْ كَفَىٰ بِٱللَّهِ بَيْنِي وَبَيْنَكُمْ شَهِيداً يَعْلَمُ مَا فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ بِٱلْبَاطِلِ وَكَفَرُواْ بِٱللَّهِ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْخَاسِرُونَ,Say ‘God suffices as a witness between me and you’ of my sincerity. He knows whatever is in the heavens and the earth including my circumstances and yours. And those who believe in falsehood namely all that is worshipped besides God and who disbelieve in God from among you — those they are the losers in their bargain for they have purchased disbelief in return for faith.
وَيَسْتَعْجِلُونَكَ بِٱلْعَذَابِ وَلَوْلاَ أَجَلٌ مُّسَمًّى لَّجَآءَهُمُ ٱلْعَذَابُ وَلَيَأْتِيَنَّهُمْ بَغْتَةً وَهُمْ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ,And they ask you to hasten the chastisement. Yet were it not for an appointed term for this chastisement the chastisement would have come upon them before long but it shall assuredly come upon them suddenly while they are unaware of the time of its coming.
يَسْتَعْجِلُونَكَ بِٱلْعَذَابِ وَإِنَّ جَهَنَّمَ لَمُحِيطَةٌ بِٱلْكَافِرِينَ,And they ask you to hasten the chastisement in this world. And lo! Hell shall encompass the disbelievers
يَوْمَ يَغْشَاهُمُ ٱلْعَذَابُ مِن فَوْقِهِمْ وَمِن تَحْتِ أَرْجُلِهِمْ وَيِقُولُ ذُوقُواْ مَا كُنْتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ,on the Day when the chastisement shall envelop them from above them and from under their feet and We shall say thereat read the verb as naqūlu in other words ‘We shall command that it be said; or if read yaqūlu ‘he shall say’ namely the one in charge of meting out chastisement ‘Taste now what you used to do!’ that is taste the requital for it as you will not be able to elude Us.
يٰعِبَادِيَ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُوۤاْ إِنَّ أَرْضِي وَاسِعَةٌ فَإِيَّايَ فَٱعْبُدُونِ,O My servants who believe! My earth is indeed vast. So worship only Me in whichever land worship is possible by emigrating to it from a land in which worship is not possible — this verse was revealed regarding the oppressed Muslims living in Mecca who were constrained to manifest their Islam in it.
كُلُّ نَفْسٍ ذَآئِقَةُ ٱلْمَوْتِ ثُمَّ إِلَيْنَا تُرْجَعُونَ,Every soul shall taste death. Then to Us you shall be returned turja‘ūna; or yurja‘ūna ‘they shall be returned’ after resurrection.
وَٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ لَنُبَوِّئَنَّهُمْ مِّنَ ٱلْجَنَّةِ غُرَفَاً تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلأَنْهَارُ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا نِعْمَ أَجْرُ ٱلْعَامِلِينَ,And those who believe and perform righteous deeds We shall surely lodge them We shall give them residence a variant reading has nuthwiyannahum derived from thawā’ ‘residence’; the transitive link to the indirect object ghurafan is made without the preposition fī ‘in’ in lofty abodes of Paradise underneath which rivers flow to abide decreed for them to live forever in them — excellent is this reward as the reward of the toilers;
ٱلَّذِينَ صَبَرُواْ وَعَلَىٰ رَبِّهِمْ يَتَوَكَّلُونَ,they are those who are steadfast in enduring the harm inflicted upon them by the idolaters and in enduring the Emigration in order to make manifest the religion of Islam and who put their trust in their Lord so that He provides for them whence they do not expect.
وَكَأَيِّن مِّن دَآبَّةٍ لاَّ تَحْمِلُ رِزْقَهَا ٱللَّهُ يَرْزُقُهَا وَإِيَّاكُمْ وَهُوَ ٱلسَّمِيعُ ٱلْعَلِيمُ,And how many ka-ayyin means kam an animal there is that does not bear its own provision on account of its inability to do so. Yet God provides for it and for you O Emigrants al-muhājirūn even when you carry with you neither supplies nor substance. And He is the Hearer of your sayings the Knower of your consciences.
وَلَئِن سَأَلْتَهُمْ مَّنْ خَلَقَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضَ وَسَخَّرَ ٱلشَّمْسَ وَٱلْقَمَرَ لَيَقُولُنَّ ٱللَّهُ فَأَنَّىٰ يُؤْفَكُونَ,And if wa-la-in the lām is for oaths you were to ask them namely the disbelievers ‘Who created the heavens and the earth and disposed the sun and the moon?’ They would assuredly say ‘God.’ So how then are they turned away? from affirming His Oneness after affirming that God created them.
ٱللَّهُ يَبْسُطُ ٱلرِّزْقَ لِمَن يَشَآءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ وَيَقْدِرُ لَهُ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عَلِيمٌ,God extends provision He makes it abundant for whomever He will of His servants by way of a test and He straitens He restricts it for him after having extended it that is for whomever He will to try. Truly God has knowledge of all things among them the occasion in which it is appropriate for Him to extend or to straiten.
وَلَئِن سَأَلْتَهُمْ مَّن نَّزَّلَ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مَآءً فَأَحْيَا بِهِ ٱلأَرْضَ مِن بَعْدِ مَوْتِهَا لَيَقُولُنَّ ٱللَّهُ قُلِ ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ بَلْ أَكْثَرُهُمْ لاَ يَعْقِلُونَ,And if wa-la-in the lām is for oaths you were to ask them ‘Who sends down water from the heaven and therewith revives the earth after its death?’ They would assuredly say ‘God’ so how can they ascribe partners to Him?! Say to them ‘Praise be to God!’ that the proof has been established against you. Nay but most of them do not realise their contradictiousness in this respect.
وَمَا هَـٰذِهِ ٱلْحَيَاةُ ٱلدُّنْيَآ إِلاَّ لَهْوٌ وَلَعِبٌ وَإِنَّ ٱلدَّارَ ٱلآخِرَةَ لَهِيَ ٱلْحَيَوَانُ لَوْ كَانُواْ يَعْلَمُونَ,And the life of this world is nothing but diversion and play whereas closeness to God pertains to concern for the Hereafter since the fruits thereof will be revealed in it. But surely the Abode of the Hereafter is indeed the true Life if they only knew this then they would not prefer this world to it.
فَإِذَا رَكِبُواْ فِي ٱلْفُلْكِ دَعَوُاْ ٱللَّهَ مُخْلِصِينَ لَهُ ٱلدِّينَ فَلَمَّا نَجَّاهُمْ إِلَى ٱلْبَرِّ إِذَا هُمْ يُشْرِكُونَ,And when they board the ship they call on God making their supplications purely to Him in other words they do not call on any other besides Him suffering distress which only He is able to remove; but when He delivers them to land behold! they ascribe partners to Him
لِيَكْفُرُواْ بِمَآ آتَيْنَاهُمْ وَلِيَتَمَتَّعُواْ فَسَوْفَ يَعلَمُونَ,that they may be ungrateful for what We have bestowed on them of graces and that they may seek enjoyment in consenting to worship idols together a variant reading for the purposive wa-li-yatamatta‘ū has wa’l-yatamatta‘ū ‘and let them seek their enjoyment’ as an imperative denoting a threat for they will soon know! the consequences of this.
أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْاْ أَنَّا جَعَلْنَا حَرَماً آمِناً وَيُتَخَطَّفُ ٱلنَّاسُ مِنْ حَوْلِهِمْ أَفَبِٱلْبَاطِلِ يُؤْمِنُونَ وَبِنِعْمَةِ ٱللَّهِ يَكْفُرُونَ,Or is it that they have not seen have not realised that We have appointed their town of Mecca to be a secure Sanctuary while people are snatched away all around them? by being killed or taken captive except for them? Is it that they believe in falsehood in the idol and are wont to be ungrateful for God’s grace? when they ascribe partners to Him?
وَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّنْ ٱفْتَرَىٰ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ كَذِباً أَوْ كَذَّبَ بِٱلْحَقِّ لَمَّا جَآءَهُ أَلَيْسَ فِي جَهَنَّمَ مَثْوًى لِّلْكَافِرِينَ,And who — in other words there is none who — does greater wrong than he who invents a lie against God by ascribing partners to Him or denies truth be it the Prophet or the Book when it comes to him? Is there not in Hell a lodging an abode for the disbelievers? in other words there is such an abode therein and such a person belongs with them.
وَٱلَّذِينَ جَاهَدُواْ فِينَا لَنَهْدِيَنَّهُمْ سُبُلَنَا وَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَمَعَ ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,But as for those who struggle for Our sake for Our truth We shall assuredly guide them in Our ways that is the means to come to Us and truly God is with the virtuous the believers assisting and helping.
الۤـمۤ,Alif lām mīm God knows best what He means by these letters.
غُلِبَتِ ٱلرُّومُ,The Byzantines — who are among the People of the Scripture — have been vanquished; the Persians vanquished them and they are not people of a scripture but worship graven images. The Meccan disbelievers rejoiced in this defeat of the Byzantines and said to the Muslims ‘We shall vanquish you as the Persians vanquished the Byzantines’;
فِيۤ أَدْنَى ٱلأَرْضِ وَهُم مِّن بَعْدِ غَلَبِهِمْ سَيَغْلِبُونَ,in the nearer part of the land that is in the Byzantine land that lies nearest to Persia in Mesopotamia al-Jazīra. There the two armies met and the Persians were the ones who had begun the invasion. But they that is the Byzantines after their vanquishing ghalabihim the verbal noun ghalab has been annexed to the direct object hum in other words ghalabatu fāris iyyāhum ‘the Persians’ vanquishing of them’ shall be the victors over the Persians
فِي بِضْعِ سِنِينَ لِلَّهِ ٱلأَمْرُ مِن قَبْلُ وَمِن بَعْدُ وَيَوْمَئِذٍ يَفْرَحُ ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ,in a few years bid‘ usually means between three and nine or ten years. So the two armies met again seven years after this former encounter and the Byzantines defeated the Persians. To God belongs the command before and after that is before the defeat of the Byzantines and thereafter that is to say the Persian victory at first and the Byzantine victory later were the result of God’s command in other words His will and on that day the day when the Byzantines will be victorious the believers shall rejoice
بِنَصْرِ ٱللَّهِ يَنصُرُ مَن يَشَآءُ وَهُوَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلرَّحِيمُ,in God’s help to them against the Persians. They the believers indeed rejoiced in this as they came to know of it on the day that it took place on the day of the battle of Badr when Gabriel came down with this news thereon in addition to their rejoicing in their victory over the idolaters on that same day. He helps whomever He will; and He is the Mighty the Victor the Merciful to believers.
وَعْدَ ٱللَّهِ لاَ يُخْلِفُ ٱللَّهُ وَعْدَهُ وَلَـٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ ٱلنَّاسِ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ,The promise of God wa‘da’Llāhi is the verbal noun substituting for the full verbal construction; it is actually wa‘adahumu’Llāhu al-nasr ‘God promised them victory’. God does not fail His promise of such help but most people namely the disbelievers of Mecca are not aware of His promise to help them to victory.
يَعْلَمُونَ ظَاهِراً مِّنَ ٱلْحَيَاةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَهُمْ عَنِ ٱلآخِرَةِ هُمْ غَافِلُونَ,They know merely an outward aspect of the life of this world that is to say its various means of securing livelihood such as commerce agriculture construction and cultivation and so on; but they of the Hereafter they are oblivious this repetition of hum ‘they’ is for emphasis.
أَوَلَمْ يَتَفَكَّرُواْ فِيۤ أَنفُسِهِمْ مَّا خَلَقَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضَ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَآ إِلاَّ بِٱلْحَقِّ وَأَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّى وَإِنَّ كَثِيراً مِّنَ ٱلنَّاسِ بِلِقَآءِ رَبِّهِمْ لَكَافِرُونَ,Have they not contemplated themselves? so that they might emerge from their oblivion. God did not create the heavens and the earth and what is between them except with the truth and an appointed term for that creation at the conclusion of which this creation will perish and after which will be the Resurrection. But indeed many people that is to say such as the Meccan disbelievers disbelieve in the encounter with their Lord that is they do not believe in resurrection after death.
أَوَلَمْ يَسيرُواْ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ فَيَنظُرُواْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَاقِبَةُ ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ كَانُوۤاْ أَشَدَّ مِنْهُمْ قُوَّةً وَأَثَارُواْ ٱلأَرْضَ وَعَمَرُوهَآ أَكْثَرَ مِمَّا عَمَرُوهَا وَجَآءَتْهُمْ رُسُلُهُم بِٱلْبَيِّنَاتِ فَمَا كَانَ ٱللَّهُ لِيَظْلِمَهُمْ وَلَـٰكِن كَانُوۤاْ أَنفُسَهُمْ يَظْلِمُونَ,Have they not travelled in the land and beheld how was the consequence for those before them? of past communities which was that they were destroyed for denying their messengers. They were more powerful than them — such were ‘Ād and Thamūd — and they effected the land they tilled it and churned it up to sow crops and cultivate trees and developed it more than these the Meccan disbelievers have developed it; and their messengers brought them clear signs manifest proofs for God would never wrong them by destroying them without being guilty but they used to wrong themselves by denying their messengers.
ثُمَّ كَانَ عَاقِبَةَ ٱلَّذِينَ أَسَاءُواْ ٱلسُّوۤأَىٰ أَن كَذَّبُواْ بِآيَاتِ ٱللَّهِ وَكَانُواْ بِهَا يَسْتَهْزِئُونَ,Then the consequence for those who committed evil was evil al-sū’ā is the feminine form of al-aswa’ ‘the worst’; it may be read as the predicate of kāna if one reads ‘āqibatu in the nominative; or it is the subject of kāna if read as ‘āqibata in the accusative; and so what is meant is Hell in the former reading or according to the latter reading simply their evil actions because they denied the signs of God the Qur’ān and made a mock of them.
ٱللَّهُ يَبْدَؤُاْ ٱلْخَلْقَ ثُمَّ يُعِيدُهُ ثُمَّ إِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ,God originates creation in other words He produces the creation of mankind then He will reproduce it that is the creation of them after their death then to Him you shall be returned read turja‘ūna; or yurja‘ūna ‘they shall be returned’.
وَيَوْمَ تَقُومُ ٱلسَّاعَةُ يُبْلِسُ ٱلْمُجْرِمُونَ,And on the Day when the Hour comes the sinners will be dumbfounded the idolaters will be fall into silence as their line of argument can no longer be continued.
وَلَمْ يَكُن لَّهُمْ مِّن شُرَكَآئِهِمْ شُفَعَاءُ وَكَانُواْ بِشُرَكَآئِهِمْ كَافِرِينَ,And none from among those partners of theirs those whom they ascribed as partners of God namely the idols to intercede for them shall be intercessors for them and they shall disavow these partners of theirs in other words they shall dissociate from them.
وَيَوْمَ تَقُومُ ٱلسَّاعَةُ يَوْمَئِذٍ يَتَفَرَّقُونَ,And on the Day when the Hour comes that day yawma’idhin is repeated for emphasis they believers and disbelievers shall be separated.
فَأَمَّا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ فَهُمْ فِي رَوْضَةٍ يُحْبَرُونَ,As for those who believed and performed righteous deeds they shall be made happy in a garden of Paradise.
وَأَمَّا ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَكَذَّبُواْ بِآيَاتِنَا وَلِقَآءِ ٱلآخِرَةِ فَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ فِي ٱلْعَذَابِ مُحْضَرُونَ,But as for those who disbelieved and denied Our signs namely the Qur’ān and the encounter of the Hereafter the Resurrection and other matters those they shall be arraigned into the chastisement.
فَسُبْحَانَ ٱللَّهِ حِينَ تُمْسُونَ وَحِينَ تُصْبِحُونَ,So glory be to God — in other words so glorify God meaning perform prayer — when you enter the time of the night in which there are two prayers the sunset one maghrib and the later night one ‘ishā’ and when you rise in the morning in which there is the morning prayer subh.
وَلَهُ ٱلْحَمْدُ فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَعَشِيّاً وَحِينَ تُظْهِرُونَ,And to Him belongs all praise in the heavens and the earth — a parenthetical statement in other words the inhabitants in both of these realms praise Him — and as the sun declines wa-‘ashiyyan is a supplement to hīna ‘when’ of the previous verse in which comes the afternoon prayer ‘asr and when you enter noontime in which comes the midday prayer zuhr.
يُخْرِجُ ٱلْحَيَّ مِنَ ٱلْمَيِّتِ وَيُخْرِجُ ٱلْمَيِّتَ مِنَ ٱلْحَيِّ وَيُحْي ٱلأَرْضَ بَعْدَ مَوْتِهَا وَكَذَلِكَ تُخْرَجُونَ,He brings forth the living from the dead as in the case of the human being who is produced from a sperm-drop and a bird from an egg and He brings forth the dead a sperm-drop or an egg from the living and He revives the earth with vegetation after it has died dried out. And in such a manner of being brought forth you shall be brought forth from the graves read either as the active takhrujūna ‘you shall come forth’ or the passive tukhrajūna ‘you shall be brought forth’.
وَمِنْ آيَاتِهِ أَنْ خَلَقَكُمْ مِّن تُرَابٍ ثُمَّ إِذَآ أَنتُمْ بَشَرٌ تَنتَشِرُونَ,And of His signs exalted be He indicating His power is that He created you in other words your origin Adam of dust then lo! you are human beings of flesh and blood spreading across the earth.
وَمِنْ آيَاتِهِ أَنْ خَلَقَ لَكُم مِّنْ أَنفُسِكُمْ أَزْوَاجاً لِّتَسْكُنُوۤاْ إِلَيْهَا وَجَعَلَ بَيْنَكُم مَّوَدَّةً وَرَحْمَةً إِنَّ فِي ذَلِكَ لآيَاتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يَتَفَكَّرُونَ,And of His signs is that He created for you from yourselves mates — Eve was created from Adam’s rib and the remainder of mankind from the reproductive fluids of men and women — that you might find peace by their side and become intimate with them and He ordained between you all affection and mercy. Surely in that mentioned there are signs for a people who reflect upon God’s handiwork exalted be He.
وَمِنْ آيَاتِهِ خَلْقُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَٱخْتِلاَفُ أَلْسِنَتِكُمْ وَأَلْوَانِكُمْ إِنَّ فِي ذٰلِكَ لآيَاتٍ لِّلْعَالِمِينَ,And of His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and the differences of your tongues that is your languages such as Arabic non-Arabic and so on and your colours such as white or black or otherwise even though all of you are originally the offspring of the same man and woman. Surely in that there are signs indications of His power exalted be He for all peoples this may be vocalised either as li’l-‘ālamīna or li’l-‘ālimīna so it means either rational creatures or people of knowledge respectively.
وَمِنْ آيَاتِهِ مَنَامُكُم بِٱلَّيلِ وَٱلنَّهَارِ وَٱبْتِغَآؤُكُمْ مِّن فَضْلِهِ إِنَّ فِي ذَلِكَ لآيَاتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يَسْمَعُونَ,And of His signs is your sleep by night and day by His will as a repose for you and your seeking during the day of His bounty in other words your going about freely in order to seek a living is by His will. Surely in that there are signs for people who listen listening in a way so as to be prompted to reflect and take heed.
وَمِنْ آيَاتِهِ يُرِيكُمُ ٱلْبَرْقَ خَوْفاً وَطَمَعاً وَيُنَزِّلُ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مَآءً فَيُحْيِي بِهِ ٱلأَرْضَ بَعْدَ مَوْتِهَا إِنَّ فِي ذَلِكَ لآيَاتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يَعْقِلُونَ,And of His signs is His showing you lightning to arouse fear in the traveller of storms and hope in the one not travelling of the coming of the rain; and He sends down water from the heaven and with it He revives the earth after it has died that is after it has dried out so that it produces vegetation once again. Surely in that mentioned there are signs for people who understand a people who reflect.
وَمِنْ آيَاتِهِ أَن تَقُومَ ٱلسَّمَآءُ وَٱلأَرْضُ بِأَمْرِهِ ثُمَّ إِذَا دَعَاكُمْ دَعْوَةً مِّنَ ٱلأَرْضِ إِذَآ أَنتُمْ تَخْرُجُونَ,And of His signs is that the heaven and the earth remain standing by His command by His will without any supports; then when He calls you to come out of the earth when Isrāfīl blows the Horn for the raising from the graves to commence lo! you shall come forth from it alive. Thus your coming forth out of it by a call constitutes one of His many signs exalted be He.
وَلَهُ مَن فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ كُلٌّ لَّهُ قَانِتُونَ,And to Him belongs whoever is in the heavens and the earth as possessions creatures and servants. All are obedient to Him.
وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِي يَبْدَؤُاْ ٱلْخَلْقَ ثُمَّ يُعِيدُهُ وَهُوَ أَهْوَنُ عَلَيْهِ وَلَهُ ٱلْمَثَلُ ٱلأَعْلَىٰ فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَهُوَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ,And He it is Who initiates the creation of mankind then brings it back after their destruction and that is even easier for Him than the initiation — from the perspective of those addressed for whom to repeat something is easier than doing it for the first time — otherwise in God’s case exalted be He both are just as easy. His is the loftiest description in the heavens and the earth the most sublime attribute namely that ‘there is no god except God’. And He is the Mighty in His kingdom the Wise in His creation.
ضَرَبَ لَكُمْ مَّثَلاً مِّنْ أَنفُسِكُمْ هَلْ لَّكُمْ مِّن مَّا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُكُمْ مِّن شُرَكَآءَ فِي مَا رَزَقْنَاكُمْ فَأَنتُمْ فِيهِ سَوَآءٌ تَخَافُونَهُمْ كَخِيفَتِكُمْ أَنفُسَكُمْ كَذَلِكَ نُفَصِّلُ ٱلآيَاتِ لِقَوْمٍ يَعْقِلُونَ,He has struck He has coined for you O idolaters a similitude that is actually drawn from yourselves and it is as follows do you have among those whom your right hands own that is to say among your servants any partners of yourselves who may share in what We have provided for you of property and so on so that you and they are equal therein fearing them as you fear your own folk just as you fear those free men like you? the interrogative is meant as a negation in other words ‘your servants are not partners of yours in what you own so how can you make some of God’s servants partners of His. So We detail the signs so We explain them in such detail for people who understand a people who reflect.
بَلِ ٱتَّبَعَ ٱلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوۤاْ أَهْوَآءَهُمْ بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ فَمَن يَهْدِي مَنْ أَضَلَّ ٱللَّهُ وَمَا لَهُمْ مِّن نَّاصِرِينَ,Nay but those who do evil through idolatry follow their own desires without any knowledge. So who will guide he whom God has led astray? that is to say he will have none to guide him. And they have no helpers no protectors against God’s chastisement.
فَأَقِمْ وَجْهَكَ لِلدِّينِ حَنِيفاً فِطْرَتَ ٱللَّهِ ٱلَّتِي فَطَرَ ٱلنَّاسَ عَلَيْهَا لاَ تَبْدِيلَ لِخَلْقِ ٱللَّهِ ذَلِكَ ٱلدِّينُ ٱلْقَيِّمُ وَلَـٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ ٱلنَّاسِ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ,So set your purpose O Muhammad (s) for religion as a hanīf as one inclining to it — in other words devote your religion you and whoever follows you purely to God — a nature given by God upon which He originated mankind and this nature is His religion in other words adhere to it. There is no changing God’s creation His religion that is to say do not change it by becoming idolaters. That is the upright religion the belief in God’s Oneness but most people namely the Meccan disbelievers do not know anything of God’s Oneness —
مُنِيبِينَ إِلَيْهِ وَٱتَّقُوهُ وَأَقِيمُواْ ٱلصَّلاَةَ وَلاَ تَكُونُواْ مِنَ ٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ,turning referring to Him exalted be He concerning what He has commanded and what He has forbidden munībīna ‘turning’ is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the subject of the verb aqim ‘set up’ in other words addressing the third plural person aqīmū ‘set up’ and fear Him and establish prayer and do not be among the idolaters
مِنَ ٱلَّذِينَ فَرَّقُواْ دِينَهُمْ وَكَانُواْ شِيَعاً كُلُّ حِزْبٍ بِمَا لَدَيْهِمْ فَرِحُونَ,of those mina’lladhīna is a substitution for al-mushrikīna ‘idolaters’ using the same operator of the oblique min who have divided up their religion by being at variance over what they worship and have become dissenting factions sects divided over this matter each party among them rejoicing delighting in what they have a variant reading for farraqū is fāraqū in other words ‘of those who have parted with the religion to which they have been commanded’.
وَإِذَا مَسَّ ٱلنَّاسَ ضُرٌّ دَعَوْاْ رَبَّهُمْ مُّنِيبِينَ إِلَيْهِ ثُمَّ إِذَآ أَذَاقَهُمْ مِّنْهُ رَحْمَةً إِذَا فَرِيقٌ مِّنْهُمْ بِرَبِّهِمْ يُشْرِكُونَ,And when some distress some hardship befalls people that is people such as the Meccan disbelievers they call on their Lord turning returning in penitence to Him alone. Then when He lets them taste mercy from Him by way of rain lo! a party of them ascribe partners to their Lord.
لِيَكْفُرُواْ بِمَآ آتَيْنَاهُمْ فَتَمَتَّعُواْ فَسَوْفَ تَعْلَمُونَ,Let them be ungrateful for what We have given them this is an imperative meant as a threat. ‘So take your enjoyment. Soon you will know’ the consequences of your enjoyment there is a shift away from the third person address to the second.
أَمْ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ سُلْطَاناً فَهُوَ يَتَكَلَّمُ بِمَا كَانُواْ بِهِ يُشْرِكُونَ,Or am the hamza here is meant for denial have We revealed any warrant any argument or scripture to them which might speak a token speech of what they associate with Him? in other words commanding them to associate others with God? No!
وَإِذَآ أَذَقْنَا ٱلنَّاسَ رَحْمَةً فَرِحُواْ بِهَا وَإِن تُصِبْهُمْ سَيِّئَةٌ بِمَا قَدَّمَتْ أَيْدِيهِمْ إِذَا هُمْ يَقْنَطُونَ,And when We let people that is people such as the disbelievers of Mecca and others taste some mercy some grace they exult in it an exultation of arrogance. But if some evil some hardship befalls them for what their own hands have sent ahead behold! they despair of mercy. It is in the nature of a believer to give thanks in times of grace and to hope for mercy from his Lord in times of hardship.
أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْاْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَبْسُطُ ٱلرِّزْقَ لِمَن يَشَآءُ وَيَقْدِرُ إِنَّ فِي ذَلِكَ لآيَاتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يُؤْمِنُونَ,Have they not seen have they not realised that God extends He makes abundant His provision to whomever He will as a test and straitens? and He restricts it for whomever He will as a trial? Surely in that there are signs for people who believe in them.
فَآتِ ذَا ٱلْقُرْبَىٰ حَقَّهُ وَٱلْمِسْكِينَ وَٱبْنَ ٱلسَّبِيلِ ذَلِكَ خَيْرٌ لِّلَّذِينَ يُرِيدُونَ وَجْهَ ٱللَّهِ وَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْمُفْلِحُونَ,And give the relative what is his due in the way of dutifulness and kindness and the needy and the wayfarer the traveller give voluntary alms — the Prophet’s community must emulate him in this respect. That is better for those who desire God’s Countenance who desire His reward in exchange for what they do; those they are the successful the winners.
وَمَآ آتَيْتُمْ مِّن رِّباً لِّيَرْبُوَاْ فِي أَمْوَالِ ٱلنَّاسِ فَلاَ يَرْبُواْ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ وَمَآ آتَيْتُمْ مِّن زَكَاةٍ تُرِيدُونَ وَجْهَ ٱللَّهِ فَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْمُضْعِفُونَ,And what you give in usury — such as when something is given as a gift or a present for the purpose of demanding more in return; it the practice of usury ribā is referred to by the same noun denoting that illicit ‘extra’ ziyāda requested in the financial transaction — that it may increase the wealth of the people giving it does not increase with God — there is no reward in it for those who give it. But what you give as alms zakāt as voluntary alms sadaqa seeking thereby God’s Countenance such of you who do so — they are the receivers of manifold increase in their reward for what they sought there is here a shift of address away from the second person.
ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِي خَلَقَكُمْ ثُمَّ رَزَقَكُمْ ثُمَّ يُمِيتُكُمْ ثُمَّ يُحْيِيكُمْ هَلْ مِن شُرَكَآئِكُمْ مَّن يَفْعَلُ مِن ذَٰلِكُمْ مِّن شَيْءٍ سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَىٰ عَمَّا يُشْرِكُونَ,God is the One Who created you then provided for you then makes you die then gives you life is there anyone among your associates of those whom you have associated with God who does anything of the kind? No! Glory be to Him and exalted be He above what they associate with Him.
ظَهَرَ ٱلْفَسَادُ فِي ٱلْبَرِّ وَٱلْبَحْرِ بِمَا كَسَبَتْ أَيْدِي ٱلنَّاسِ لِيُذِيقَهُمْ بَعْضَ ٱلَّذِي عَمِلُواْ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ,Corruption has appeared on land in the wastelands because of the rain being withheld and the vegetation diminishing and on sea in lands near rivers because of their waters diminishing because of what people’s hands have perpetrated of acts of disobedience that He may make them taste li-yudhīqahum; or may be read li-nudhīqahum ‘that We may make them taste’ something of what they have done that is the punishment for it that perhaps they may repent.
قُلْ سِيرُواْ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ فَٱنْظُرُواْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَاقِبَةُ ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلُ كَانَ أَكْثَرُهُمْ مُّشْرِكِينَ,Say to the Meccan disbelievers ‘Travel in the land and behold how was the consequence for those who were before; most of them were idolaters’ and so they were destroyed because of their idolatry and their dwellings and habitations lie desolate in ruin.
فَأَقِمْ وَجْهَكَ لِلدِّينِ ٱلْقِيِّمِ مِن قَبْلِ أَن يَأْتِيَ يَوْمٌ لاَّ مَرَدَّ لَهُ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ يَوْمَئِذٍ يَصَّدَّعُونَ,So set your purpose for the upright religion the religion of Islam before there comes the inevitable day from God namely the Day of Resurrection. On that day they shall be sundered yassadda‘ūna the original tā’ yatasadda‘ūna has been assimilated with the sād that is they will be split into separate groups after the Reckoning destined for Paradise or the Fire.
مَن كَفَرَ فَعَلَيْهِ كُفْرُهُ وَمَنْ عَمِلَ صَالِحاً فَلأَنفُسِهِمْ يَمْهَدُونَ,Whoever disbelieves the consequence of his disbelief shall upon him that is the evil consequences of his disbelief which will be his being punished in the Fire and those who act righteously they will be paving the way for the salvation of their own souls preparing their places in Paradise
لِيَجْزِيَ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ مِن فَضْلِهِ إِنَّهُ لاَ يُحِبُّ ٱلْكَافِرِينَ,that He may requite li-yajziya is semantically connected to yassadda‘ūna ‘they shall be sundered’ those who believe and perform righteous deeds out of His bounty that He may reward them. Indeed He does not like the disbelievers in other words He will punish them.
وَمِنْ آيَاتِهِ أَن يُرْسِلَ ٱلرِّيَاحَ مُبَشِّرَاتٍ وَلِيُذِيقَكُمْ مِّن رَّحْمَتِهِ وَلِتَجْرِيَ ٱلْفُلْكُ بِأَمْرِهِ وَلِتَبْتَغُواْ مِن فَضْلِهِ وَلَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ,And of His signs exalted be He is that He unleashes the winds as bearers of good tidings meaning so that they may bring you good tidings of rain and that He may let you taste thereby of His mercy namely in the way of rain and fertile soil and that the ships may run thereby by His command by His will and that you may seek that you may request of His bounty provision by way of commerce at sea and that perhaps you might then give thanks for these graces O people of Mecca and so affirm His Oneness.
وَلَقَدْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ رُسُلاً إِلَىٰ قَوْمِهِمْ فَجَآءُوهُم بِٱلْبَيِّنَاتِ فَٱنتَقَمْنَا مِنَ ٱلَّذِينَ أَجْرَمُواْ وَكَانَ حَقّاً عَلَيْنَا نَصْرُ ٱلْمُؤْمِنينَ,And verily We sent before you messengers to their people and they brought them clear signs plain proofs of their sincerity concerning their Message to them but they denied them. Then We took vengeance upon those who were guilty We destroyed those who denied them and it was ever incumbent upon Us to give victory to the believers over the disbelievers by destroying these and delivering the believers.
ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِي يُرْسِلُ ٱلرِّيَاحَ فَتُثِيرُ سَحَاباً فَيَبْسُطُهُ فِي ٱلسَّمَآءِ كَيْفَ يَشَآءُ وَيَجْعَلُهُ كِسَفاً فَتَرَى ٱلْوَدْقَ يَخْرُجُ مِنْ خِلاَلِهِ فَإِذَآ أَصَابَ بِهِ مَن يَشَآءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ إِذَا هُمْ يَسْتَبْشِرُونَ,God is the One Who unleashes the winds which then raise stir up clouds and He then spreads them across the heaven as He will in small or large quantities and He forms them into fragments read kisafan or kisfan ‘scattered pieces’ then you see the rain issuing out of them that is out of the midst of them. Then when He drops it the rain upon whomever of His servants He will lo! they rejoice they are happy because of the rain.
وَإِن كَانُواْ مِن قَبْلِ أَن يُنَزَّلَ عَلَيْهِمْ مِّن قَبْلِهِ لَمُبْلِسِينَ,Though indeed before it was sent down upon them before that min qablihi is repeated for emphasis they had been despondent despairing of its sending down.
فَٱنظُرْ إِلَىٰ آثَارِ رَحْمَتِ ٱللَّهِ كَيْفَ يُحْيِ ٱلأَرْضَ بَعْدَ مَوْتِهَآ إِنَّ ذَلِكَ لَمُحْيِ ٱلْمَوْتَىٰ وَهُوَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,So behold the effects a variant reading has singular athar ‘the effect’ of God's mercy that is His grace in giving them rain how He revives the earth after it has died after it has dried out so that it produces vegetation again. Surely He is the Reviver of the dead and He has power over all things.
وَلَئِنْ أَرْسَلْنَا رِيحاً فَرَأَوْهُ مُصْفَرّاً لَّظَلُّواْ مِن بَعْدِهِ يَكْفُرُونَ,But if wa-la-in the lām is for oaths We unleash a different wind that damages vegetation and they see it turn yellow they would begin la-zallū is the response to the conditional oath after that that is after its turning yellow to disbelieve to deny the grace of having been given rain.
فَإِنَّكَ لاَ تُسْمِعُ ٱلْمَوْتَىٰ وَلاَ تُسْمِعُ ٱلصُّمَّ ٱلدُّعَآءَ إِذَا وَلَّوْاْ مُدْبِرِينَ,And so you cannot make the dead hear nor can you make the deaf hear the call when read al-du‘ā’a idhā pronouncing both hamzas or by not pronouncing the second one that comes between it and the yā’ they go away with their backs turned.
وَمَآ أَنتَ بِهَادِ ٱلْعُمْيِ عَن ضَلاَلَتِهِمْ إِن تُسْمِعُ إِلاَّ مَن يُؤْمِنُ بِآيَاتِنَا فَهُمْ مُّسْلِمُونَ,Nor can you guide the blind out of their error. You can only make hear in a way so as to understand and accept those who believe in Our signs in the Qur’ān and have thus submitted sincere in their affirmation of God’s Oneness.
ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِي خَلَقَكُمْ مِّن ضَعْفٍ ثُمَّ جَعَلَ مِن بَعْدِ ضَعْفٍ قُوَّةً ثُمَّ جَعَلَ مِن بَعْدِ قُوَّةٍ ضَعْفاً وَشَيْبَةً يَخْلُقُ مَا يَشَآءُ وَهُوَ ٱلْعَلِيمُ ٱلْقَدِيرُ,God is the One Who created you from a state of weakness from a ‘base fluid’ cf. Q. 328 then He ordained after a second weakness which is the weakness of the period of childhood strength that is the strength of youth then after strength He appointed weakness again and grey hair the weakness of old age and the grey hairs of decrepitude read vocalised as du‘f ‘weakness’ in all three places. He creates what He will of weakness and strength youth and grey hairs and He is the Knower of how to manage His creatures the Omnipotent.
وَيَوْمَ تَقُومُ ٱلسَّاعَةُ يُقْسِمُ ٱلْمُجْرِمُونَ مَا لَبِثُواْ غَيْرَ سَاعَةٍ كَذَلِكَ كَانُواْ يُؤْفَكُونَ,And on the Day when the Hour comes the guilty the disbelievers shall swear that they had not remained more than an hour in the grave. God exalted be He says That is how they use to be deceived how they used to be turned away from the truth — the Resurrection — similar to the way in which they have now been turned away from the real truth about how long they had remained.
وَقَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ ٱلْعِلْمَ وَٱلإِيمَانَ لَقَدْ لَبِثْتُمْ فِي كِتَابِ ٱللَّهِ إِلَىٰ يَوْمِ ٱلْبَعْثِ فَهَـٰذَا يَوْمُ ٱلْبَعْثِ وَلَـٰكِنَّكُمْ كُنتمْ لاَ تَعْلَمُونَ,But those who have been given knowledge and faith of angels and others shall say ‘You have remained according to God’s decree in accordance with what He had decreed for you in His prior knowledge until the Day of Resurrection. This is the Day of Resurrection which you rejected but you did not know’ that it would come to pass.
فَيَوْمَئِذٍ لاَّ ينفَعُ ٱلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ مَعْذِرَتُهُمْ وَلاَ هُمْ يُسْتَعْتَبُونَ,So on that day their excuses for denying it will not profit read lā yanfa‘u or lā tanfa‘u the evildoers nor will they be asked to make amends yusta‘tabūna means ‘they will not be asked for al-‘utbā’ which denotes ‘a return to that which pleases God’.
وَلَقَدْ ضَرَبْنَا لِلنَّاسِ فِي هَـٰذَا ٱلْقُرْآنِ مِن كُلِّ مَثَلٍ وَلَئِن جِئْتَهُمْ بِآيَةٍ لَّيَقُولَنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوۤاْ إِنْ أَنتُمْ إِلاَّ مُبْطِلُونَ,And verily We have struck We have coined for mankind in this Qur’ān every kind of similitude as a way of cautioning them. And if wa-la-in the lām is for oaths you O Muhammad (s) were to bring them a miraculous sign such as the staff or the hand in the case of Moses those who disbelieve from among them will certainly say la-yaqūlanna the indicative nūn has been omitted because of the other nūn coming after it and likewise the wāw replaced by the damma in lu because of two unvocalised consonants coming together and it indicates the plural person ‘You — in other words Muhammad (s) and his Companions — are nothing but followers of falsehood’.
كَذَلِكَ يَطْبَعُ ٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ قُلُوبِ ٱلَّذِينَ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ,Thus does God seal the hearts of those who do not know anything of God’s Oneness in the same way that He has sealed the hearts of these aforementioned individuals.
فَٱصْبِرْ إِنَّ وَعْدَ ٱللَّهِ حَقٌّ وَلاَ يَسْتَخِفَّنَّكَ ٱلَّذِينَ لاَ يُوقِنُونَ,So be patient. Surely God’s promise to give you victory over them is true. And do not let them cause you to be inconstant those who are uncertain of the Resurrection in other words do not let them cause you to succumb to inconstancy and frivolity by abandoning patience that is to say do not abandon it.
الۤـمۤ,Alif lām mīm God knows best what He means by these letters.
تِلْكَ آيَاتُ ٱلْكِتَابِ ٱلْحَكِيمِ,Those namely these signs are the signs of the wise Book the Qur’ān the one containing wisdom the genitive annexation āyātu’l-kitābi’l-hakīm has the partitive meaning of min ‘from’;
هُدًى وَرَحْمَةً لِّلْمُحْسِنِينَ,it is a guidance and a mercy read nominative rahmatun; the popular accusative reading rahmatan would make it a circumstantial qualifier referring to āyāt ‘signs’ the operator of which being the implicit demonstrative import of tilka ‘those’ for the virtuous
ٱلَّذِينَ يُقِيمُونَ ٱلصَّلاَةَ وَيُؤْتُونَ ٱلزَّكَاةَ وَهُمْ بِٱلآخِرَةِ هُمْ يُوقِنُونَ,who maintain the prayer alladhīna yuqīmūna’l-salāta an explication of al-muhsinīna ‘the virtuous’ and pay the alms and who are certain of the Hereafter the repetition of hum ‘they’ here translated ‘who’ is for emphasis.
أُوْلَـٰئِكَ عَلَىٰ هُدًى مِّن رَّبِّهِمْ وَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْمُفْلِحُونَ,Such follow guidance from their Lord and it is they who are the successful the winners.
وَمِنَ ٱلنَّاسِ مَن يَشْتَرِي لَهْوَ ٱلْحَدِيثِ لِيُضِلَّ عَن سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ وَيَتَّخِذَهَا هُزُواً أُوْلَـٰئِكَ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ مُّهِينٌ,And among people there is he who purchases idle talk in other words that part of it which diverts people from its true significance that he may lead people astray read li-yadilla; or li-yudilla from the way of God the religion of Islam without knowledge and take it read subjunctive wa-yattakhidhahā as a supplement to yudilla ‘that he may lead astray’; or indicative wa-yattakhidhuhā as a supplement to yashtarī ‘who buys’ in mockery as something to be mocked. For such there will be a humiliating chastisement one of abasement.
وَإِذَا تُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْهِ ءَايَاتُنَا وَلَّىٰ مُسْتَكْبِراً كَأَن لَّمْ يَسْمَعْهَا كَأَنَّ فِيۤ أُذُنَيْهِ وَقْراً فَبَشِّرْهُ بِعَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ,And when Our signs in other words in the Qur’ān are recited to such a one he turns away disdainfully as though he never heard them as though there were a deafness in his ears both comparisons constitute two circumstantial qualifiers referring to the subject of the verb wallā ‘turns away’; or it is that the second comparison is an explication of the first. So give him tidings of inform him of a painful chastisement. The use of the expression ‘good tidings’ meant derisively against such a person — this was al-Nadr b. al-Hārith. He used to visit al-Hīra for commerce and purchase books containing the stories of the non-Arab peoples and then recount these to the people of Mecca. He would say ‘Muhammad recounts to you the stories of ‘Ād and Thamūd whereas I relate to you the stories of the Persians and the Byzantines!’ They would thus go to enjoy his stories and neglect to listen to the Qur’ān.
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ لَهُمْ جَنَّاتُ ٱلنَّعِيمِ,Surely those who believe and perform righteous deeds for them there shall be Gardens of Bliss
خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا وَعْدَ ٱللَّهِ حَقّاً وَهُوَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ,abiding therein khālidīna fīhā is a circumstantial qualification of a future status in other words their abiding therein will have been ordained once they enter it — a promise of God in truth that is to say God promised them this and realised it in truth; and He is the Mighty Whom nothing can overwhelm and so prevent Him from fulfilling His promise and His threat of chastisement the Wise the One Who assigns all things to their rightful places.
خَلَقَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ بِغَيْرِ عَمَدٍ تَرَوْنَهَا وَأَلْقَىٰ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ رَوَاسِيَ أَن تَمِيدَ بِكُمْ وَبَثَّ فِيهَا مِن كُلِّ دَآبَّةٍ وَأَنزَلْنَا مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مَآءً فَأَنْبَتْنَا فِيهَا مِن كُلِّ زَوْجٍ كَرِيمٍ,He created the heavens without any pillars that you can see ‘amad is the plural of ‘imād which is an ustuwāna ‘a column’ — this is the truth since there are no actual pillars — and cast high mountains into the earth lest it shake with you and He dispersed therein all kinds beasts. And We sent down there is a shift from the third to the second person water from the heaven and We caused to grow in it of every splendid kind every fair specimen.
هَـٰذَا خَلْقُ ٱللَّهِ فَأَرُونِي مَاذَا خَلَقَ ٱلَّذِينَ مِن دُونِهِ بَلِ ٱلظَّالِمُونَ فِي ضَلاَلٍ مُّبِينٍ,This is God’s creation in other words what is created by Him. Now show me inform me O people of Mecca what those you worship besides Him those other than Him have created namely your gods so that you have associated them with Him exalted be He mā is an interrogative of denial and a subject; dhā has the significance of alladhī and what follows it of the relative clause is the predicate of the subject mā; arūnī glosses ‘the action’ and what follows it stands in place of two direct objects. Nay bal is for transition but the evildoers are in manifest error error that is evident because of their ascribing partners to God and you are like them.
وَلَقَدْ آتَيْنَا لُقْمَانَ ٱلْحِكْمَةَ أَنِ ٱشْكُرْ للَّهِ وَمَن يَشْكُرْ فَإِنَّمَا يَشْكُرُ لِنَفْسِهِ وَمَن كَفَرَ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَنِيٌّ حَمِيدٌ,And verily We gave Luqmān wisdom comprising knowledge religiousness and right-mindedness in speech; his many wisdoms are well-known. He used to give legal opinions in matters of religion before David was summoned to prophethood but lived on into the latter’s summoning. He then took to acquiring knowledge from him David and refrained from giving any more legal opinions explaining this thus ‘Should I not be content if someone like the prophet David has spared me the trouble?’ He was once asked ‘What is the worst kind of person?’ He said ‘The one who does not care that people should see him doing evil’. In other words We gave him wisdom and We said to him ‘Give thanks to God for the wisdom that He has given you. Whoever gives thanks only for his own sake because the reward for his gratitude shall be his and whoever is ungrateful for a grace then surely God is Independent without need of His creation Praised’ in what He does.
وَإِذْ قَالَ لُقْمَانُ لابْنِهِ وَهُوَ يَعِظُهُ يٰبُنَيَّ لاَ تُشْرِكْ بِٱللَّهِ إِنَّ ٱلشِّرْكَ لَظُلْمٌ عَظِيمٌ,And mention when Luqmān said to his son when he was admonishing him ‘O my son yā bunayya is an affectionate diminutive of yā ibnī do not ascribe partners to God idolatry is truly a tremendous wrong’ so return to him in repentance and submit to Him.
وَوَصَّيْنَا ٱلإِنْسَانَ بِوَالِدَيْهِ حَمَلَتْهُ أُمُّهُ وَهْناً عَلَىٰ وَهْنٍ وَفِصَالُهُ فِي عَامَيْنِ أَنِ ٱشْكُرْ لِي وَلِوَالِدَيْكَ إِلَيَّ ٱلْمَصِيرُ,And We have enjoined man concerning his parents We commanded him to be dutiful towards them — his mother bears him and weakens in weakness after weakness that is to say she is weakened by the pregnancy the pains of labour and the delivery; and his weaning is in two years and We said to him to man ‘Give thanks to Me and to your parents. To Me is the journey’s end the return.
وَإِن جَاهَدَاكَ عَلَىٰ أَن تُشْرِكَ بِي مَا لَيْسَ لَكَ بِهِ عِلْمٌ فَلاَ تُطِعْهُمَا وَصَاحِبْهُمَا فِي ٱلدُّنْيَا مَعْرُوفاً وَٱتَّبِعْ سَبِيلَ مَنْ أَنَابَ إِلَيَّ ثُمَّ إِلَيَّ مَرْجِعُكُمْ فَأُنَبِّئُكُمْ بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ,But if they urge you to ascribe to Me as partner that whereof you have no knowledge that accords with any reality then do not obey them. And keep them company in this world honourably in other words with decency dutifulness and kindness — and follow the way of him who returns to Me in penitence with acts of obedience. Then to Me will be your return and I will inform you of what you used to do and requite you for it the entire sentence containing the ‘enjoinder’ verse 14 and what comes after it constitutes a parenthetical statement.
يٰبُنَيَّ إِنَّهَآ إِن تَكُ مِثْقَالَ حَبَّةٍ مِّنْ خَرْدَلٍ فَتَكُنْ فِي صَخْرَةٍ أَوْ فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ أَوْ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ يَأْتِ بِهَا ٱللَّهُ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَطِيفٌ خَبِيرٌ,‘O my son! Even if it namely the evil trait should be the weight of a grain of mustard-seed and even if it be in a rock or in the heavens or in the earth in other words in the most concealed place therein God will bring it forth and He will call that person to account for it. Truly God is Subtle in bringing it forth Aware of its location.
يٰبُنَيَّ أَقِمِ ٱلصَّلاَةَ وَأْمُرْ بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ وَٱنْهَ عَنِ ٱلْمُنْكَرِ وَٱصْبِرْ عَلَىٰ مَآ أَصَابَكَ إِنَّ ذَلِكَ مِنْ عَزْمِ ٱلأُمُورِ,O my son! Establish prayer and enjoin decency and forbid indecency. And be patient through whatever may befall you as a result of such enjoining and forbidding. Truly that which is mentioned is true constancy in other words that is one of those necessary things regarding which one must have firm resolve.
وَلاَ تُصَعِّرْ خَدَّكَ لِلنَّاسِ وَلاَ تَمْشِ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ مَرَحاً إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لاَ يُحِبُّ كُلَّ مُخْتَالٍ فَخُورٍ,And do not turn your cheek disdainfully from people tusa‘‘ir a variant reading has tusā‘ir do not turn your face away in disdain and do not walk upon the earth exultantly in other words with haughtiness. Truly God does not like any swaggering braggart strutting in his step boasting in front of people.
وَٱقْصِدْ فِي مَشْيِكَ وَٱغْضُضْ مِن صَوْتِكَ إِنَّ أَنكَرَ ٱلأَصْوَاتِ لَصَوْتُ ٱلْحَمِيرِ,And be modest in your bearing being moderate in it neither dragging slowly nor rushing but peaceful and dignified and lower your voice; indeed the most hideous of voices is the donkey’s voice’ beginning its hideous bray with an exhalation and ending with an inhalation.
أَلَمْ تَرَوْاْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ سَخَّرَ لَكُمْ مَّا فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَأَسْبَغَ عَلَيْكُمْ نِعَمَهُ ظَاهِرَةً وَبَاطِنَةً وَمِنَ ٱلنَّاسِ مَن يُجَادِلُ فِي ٱللَّهِ بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ وَلاَ هُدًى وَلاَ كِتَابٍ مُّنِيرٍ,Do you not see do you not realise O you who are being addressed that God has disposed for you whatever is in the heavens such as the sun the moon and the stars that you may benefit from them and whatever is in the earth of fruits rivers and animals and He has showered He has made abundant and made complete His favours upon you both outwardly namely by giving you your wholesome form even limbs and otherwise and inwardly? that is by giving you knowledge and so on. Yet among people that is people such as the Meccan disbelievers there are those who dispute concerning God without any knowledge or guidance from a messenger or an illuminating scripture revealed by God rather they dispute by blindly imitating others.
وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمُ ٱتَّبِعُواْ مَآ أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ قَالُواْ بَلْ نَتَّبِعُ مَا وَجَدْنَا عَلَيْهِ آبَآءَنَا أَوَلَوْ كَانَ ٱلشَّيْطَانُ يَدْعُوهُمْ إِلَىٰ عَذَابِ ٱلسَّعِيرِ,And if it is said to them ‘Follow what God has revealed’ they say ‘We will rather follow what we found our fathers following’. He exalted be He says What! Would they follow such things even though Satan were calling them to the chastisement of the Blaze? that is to what will bring it about necessarily? No!
وَمَن يُسْلِمْ وَجْهَهُ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ وَهُوَ مُحْسِنٌ فَقَدِ ٱسْتَمْسَكَ بِٱلْعُرْوَةِ ٱلْوُثْقَىٰ وَإِلَىٰ ٱللَّهِ عَاقِبَةُ ٱلأَمُورِ,And whoever surrenders his purpose to God that is whoever takes to obeying Him and is virtuous a believer in His Oneness has certainly grasped the firmest handle the stronger end which is not in danger of being severed and to God belongs the sequel of all matters their ultimate return.
وَمَن كَفَرَ فَلاَ يَحْزُنكَ كُفْرُهُ إِلَيْنَا مَرْجِعُهُمْ فَنُنَبِّئُهُم بِمَا عَمِلُوۤاْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلِيمٌ بِذَاتِ ٱلصُّدُورِ,And whoever disbelieves then do not let his disbelief grieve you O Muhammad (s) do not be concerned with his disbelief. To Us shall be their return and We shall inform them of what they did. Truly God knows best what is in the breasts just as He knows other things and so He will requite them accordingly.
نُمَتِّعُهُمْ قَلِيلاً ثُمَّ نَضْطَرُّهُمْ إِلَىٰ عَذَابٍ غَلِيظٍ,We will give them comfort in this world for a little while for the duration of the days of their lives then We will drive them in the Hereafter to a harsh chastisement namely the chastisement of the Fire from which they will find no escape.
وَلَئِن سَأَلْتَهُمْ مَّنْ خَلَقَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضَ لَيَقُولُنَّ ٱللَّهُ قُلِ ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ بَلْ أَكْثَرُهُمْ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ,And if wa-la-in the lām is for oaths you were to ask them ‘Who created the heavens and the earth?’ they will surely say ‘God’ la-yaqūlunna ‘they will surely say’ the indicative nūn has been omitted because of the like sc. the nūn coming after it and likewise the wāw of the plural person because of two unvocalised consonants coming together. Say ‘Praise be to God’ for the manifestation of the definitive argument against them by the affirmation of the Oneness of God. Nay but most of them do not realise that this affirmation is an obligation upon them.
لِلَّهِ مَا فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ هُوَ ٱلْغَنِيُّ ٱلْحَمِيدُ,To God belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth as possessions creatures and servants and so none other than Him deserves to be worshipped in them. Indeed God He is the Independent without need of His creatures the Praised in His actions.
وَلَوْ أَنَّمَا فِي ٱلأَرْضِ مِن شَجَرَةٍ أَقْلاَمٌ وَٱلْبَحْرُ يَمُدُّهُ مِن بَعْدِهِ سَبْعَةُ أَبْحُرٍ مَّا نَفِدَتْ كَلِمَاتُ ٱللَّهِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ,And if all the trees on earth were pens and the sea wa’l-bahru is a supplement to mā the subject of anna replenished with seven more seas were ink the Words of God would not be spent those words expressing all the things He knows written in those pens with that amount of ink or with even more ink than that would not be spent for His knowledge exalted be He is infinite. Truly God is Mighty nothing being beyond Him Wise from Whose knowledge and wisdom nothing escapes.
مَّا خَلْقُكُمْ وَلاَ بَعْثُكُمْ إِلاَّ كَنَفْسٍ وَاحِدَةٍ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ سَمِيعٌ بَصِيرٌ,Your creation and your resurrection are only as that of a single soul in terms of creation and resurrection because it is the result of the words kun fa-yakūn ‘“Be!” and it is!’ Truly God is Hearer hearing everything that may be heard Seer seeing everything that may be seen nothing able to distract Him from anything else.
أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُولِجُ ٱلْلَّيْلَ فِي ٱلنَّهَارِ وَيُولِجُ ٱلنَّهَارَ فِي ٱلْلَّيْلِ وَسَخَّرَ ٱلشَّمْسَ وَٱلْقَمَرَ كُلٌّ يَجْرِيۤ إِلَىٰ أَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّى وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيرٌ,Have you not seen have you not realised O you being addressed that God makes the night pass into the day and makes the day pass into the night such that the increase of the one is relative to the decrease of the other and He has disposed the sun and the moon each of the two running in its course to an appointed term namely to the Day of Resurrection and that God is Aware of what you do?
ذَلِكَ بِأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ هُوَ ٱلْحَقُّ وَأَنَّ مَا يَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِهِ ٱلْبَاطِلُ وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ هُوَ ٱلْعَلِيُّ ٱلْكَبِيرُ,That which is mentioned is so because God He is the Truth the established truth and whatever they call on read yad‘ūna; or tad‘ūna ‘you call on’ whatever they worship besides Him is evanescent falsehood and because God is the High Exalted above His creation by virtue of His subjugation of them the Great the Mighty.
أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّ ٱلْفُلْكَ تَجْرِي فِي ٱلْبَحْرِ بِنِعْمَتِ ٱللَّهِ لِيُرِيَكُمْ مِّنْ آيَاتِهِ إِنَّ فِي ذَلِكَ لآيَاتٍ لِّكُلِّ صَبَّارٍ شَكُورٍ,Have you not seen that the ships run upon the sea by the grace of God that He may show you O you who are being addressed in this statement some of His signs? Surely in that there are signs lessons for every servant who is steadfast in abstaining from acts of disobedience to God grateful for His grace.
وَإِذَا غَشِيَهُمْ مَّوْجٌ كَٱلظُّلَلِ دَعَوُاْ ٱللَّهَ مُخْلِصِينَ لَهُ ٱلدِّينَ فَلَمَّا نَجَّاهُمْ إِلَى ٱلْبَرِّ فَمِنْهُمْ مُّقْتَصِدٌ وَمَا يَجْحَدُ بِآيَاتِنَآ إِلاَّ كُلُّ خَتَّارٍ كَفُورٍ,And if waves cover them that is if these rise above the disbelievers like awnings like mountains that act as awnings over those below them they call on God sincere before Him in their faith that is in their supplication that He may deliver them in other words they do not call on any other god with Him; but when He delivers them to land some of them compromise middling between belief and disbelief while others persist in their disbelief. And none denies Our signs an example of which is Our delivering them from such treacherous waves except every perfidious ingrate ungrateful for God’s graces exalted be He.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّاسُ ٱتَّقُواْ رَبَّكُمْ وَٱخْشَوْاْ يَوْماً لاَّ يَجْزِي وَالِدٌ عَن وَلَدِهِ وَلاَ مَوْلُودٌ هُوَ جَازٍ عَن وَالِدِهِ شَيْئاً إِنَّ وَعْدَ ٱللَّهِ حَقٌّ فَلاَ تَغُرَّنَّكُمُ ٱلْحَيَاةُ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَلاَ يَغُرَّنَّكُم بِٱللَّهِ ٱلْغَرُورُ,O people namely such as the people of Mecca fear your Lord and fear a day when no parent shall avail a child thereon in any way; and no child thereon shall avail its parent in any way. Surely God’s promise of resurrection is true. So do not let the life of this world deceive you and divert you from Islam and do not let the Deceiver Satan deceive you concerning God because of His forbearance and granting people respite.
إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عِندَهُ عِلْمُ ٱلسَّاعَةِ وَيُنَزِّلُ ٱلْغَيْثَ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا فِي ٱلأَرْحَامِ وَمَا تَدْرِي نَفْسٌ مَّاذَا تَكْسِبُ غَداً وَمَا تَدْرِي نَفْسٌ بِأَيِّ أَرْضٍ تَمُوتُ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلَيمٌ خَبِيرٌ,Lo! God with Him lies knowledge of the Hour when it will come to pass; and He sends down read yunzilu or yunazzilu the rain at times which only He knows; and He knows what is in the wombs whether it is a male or a female; and not one of the three things is known by anyone other than God exalted be He. And no soul knows what it will earn tomorrow of good or evil but God exalted be He knows this; and no soul knows in what land it will die but God exalted be He knows this. Truly God is Knower of all things Aware of the inward and outward aspects thereof. Al-Bukhārī reported by way of an isnād from ‘Abd Allāh Ibn ‘Umar the following hadīth ‘The Keys of the Unseen are five Lo! God with Him lies knowledge of the Hour … to the end of the sūra’ above.
الۤـمۤ,Alif lām mīm God knows best what He means by these letters.
تَنزِيلُ ٱلْكِتَابِ لاَ رَيْبَ فِيهِ مِن رَّبِّ ٱلْعَالَمِينَ,The revelation of the Book the Qur’ān tanzīlu’l-kitābi the subject whereof there is no doubt lā rayba fīh the first predicate from the Lord of the Worlds min rabbi’l-‘ālamīna the second predicate.
أَمْ يَقُولُونَ ٱفْتَرَاهُ بَلْ هُوَ ٱلْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّكَ لِتُنذِرَ قَوْماً مَّآ أَتَاهُم مِّن نَّذِيرٍ مِّن قَبْلِكَ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَهْتَدُونَ,Or do they say ‘He Muhammad (s) has invented it’? Nay but it is the truth from your Lord that you may warn thereby a people to whom no warner came before you mā is for negation that perhaps they may find right guidance by your warning.
ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِي خَلَقَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضَ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا فِي سِتَّةِ أَيَّامٍ ثُمَّ ٱسْتَوَىٰ عَلَى ٱلْعَرْشِ مَا لَكُمْ مِّن دُونِهِ مِن وَلِيٍّ وَلاَ شَفِيعٍ أَفَلاَ تَتَذَكَّرُونَ,God is He Who created the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them in six days the first of which was Sunday and the last of which was Friday then He presided upon the Throne al-‘arsh in the classical Arabic idiom denotes the seat of a king a presiding worthy of Him. You do not have O disbelievers of Mecca besides Him in other words other than Him any protector min waliyyin is the subject of the particle mā with the min added extra in other words any helper or intercessor to ward off His chastisement from you. Will you not then remember? this and become believers.
يُدَبِّرُ ٱلأَمْرَ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ إِلَى ٱلأَرْضِ ثُمَّ يَعْرُجُ إِلَيْهِ فِي يَوْمٍ كَانَ مِقْدَارُهُ أَلْفَ سَنَةٍ مِّمَّا تَعُدُّونَ,He directs the command from the heaven to the earth for the duration of this world then it ascends then the command and the direction thereof returns to Him in a day whose measure is a thousand years by your reckoning in this world. In sūrat sa’ala An asker asked the measure is said to be ‘fifty thousand years’ Q. 704 — and this day is the Day of Resurrection reckoned so because of the severity of its terrors for the disbeliever. As for the believer however for him it will be easier than performing any one of his obligatory prayers in this world — as is stated in hadīth.
ذٰلِكَ عَالِمُ ٱلْغَيْبِ وَٱلشَّهَادَةِ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلرَّحِيمُ,That Creator and Director is the Knower of the Unseen and the visible that is what is hidden from creatures and what is present before them the Mighty the Invincible in His kingdom the Merciful to those who are obedient to Him
ٱلَّذِيۤ أَحْسَنَ كُلَّ شَيْءٍ خَلَقَهُ وَبَدَأَ خَلْقَ ٱلإِنْسَانِ مِن طِينٍ,Who perfected everything that He created read khalaqahu as a past tense functioning as an adjectival qualification of what He perfected; or khalqahu ‘its creation’ as an inclusive substitution for kulla shay’in ‘everything’. And He began the creation of man Adam from clay
ثُمَّ جَعَلَ نَسْلَهُ مِن سُلاَلَةٍ مِّن مَّآءٍ مَّهِينٍ,then He made his progeny his offspring from an extract a blood clot of a base delicate fluid namely the sperm-drop;
ثُمَّ سَوَّاهُ وَنَفَخَ فِيهِ مِن رُّوحِهِ وَجَعَلَ لَكُمُ ٱلسَّمْعَ وَٱلأَبْصَارَ وَٱلأَفْئِدَةَ قَلِيلاً مَّا تَشْكُرُونَ,then He proportioned him that is to say He created Adam and breathed into him of His spirit in other words He made him a living sensory being after having been an inanimate thing. And He made for you in other words for you his descendants hearing meaning ears and sight and hearts. Little thanks do you give mā here is extra emphasising the ‘littleness’ of the thanks.
وَقَالُوۤاْ أَءِذَا ضَلَلْنَا فِي ٱلأَرْضِ أَءِنَّا لَفِي خَلْقٍ جَدِيدٍ بَلْ هُم بِلَقَآءِ رَبِّهِمْ كَافِرُونَ,And they namely the deniers of resurrection say ‘When we are lost beneath the earth when we have gone thereunder having become dust mixed with its dust shall we be indeed created anew?’ an interrogative of denial; read a-innā by pronouncing both hamzas or by not pronouncing the second one and inserting an alif between them either way in both places. God exalted be He says Nay but they disbelieve in the encounter with their Lord through resurrection.
قُلْ يَتَوَفَّاكُم مَّلَكُ ٱلْمَوْتِ ٱلَّذِي وُكِّلَ بِكُمْ ثُمَّ إِلَىٰ رَبِّكُمْ تُرْجَعُونَ,Say to them ‘The Angel of death who has been charged with you shall receive you in death in other words he shall seize your spirits then to your Lord you shall be returned’ alive whereat He will requite you for your deeds.
وَلَوْ تَرَىٰ إِذِ ٱلْمُجْرِمُونَ نَاكِسُواْ رُءُوسِهِمْ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ رَبَّنَآ أَبْصَرْنَا وَسَمِعْنَا فَٱرْجِعْنَا نَعْمَلْ صَالِحاً إِنَّا مُوقِنُونَ,And if could you but see the guilty the disbelievers hanging their heads low before their Lord lowering them in shame saying ‘Our Lord! We have seen the resurrection that we denied and heard from You the confirmation of the truth of the messengers concerning that in which we used to call them liars. So send us back to the world so that we may act righteously therein for indeed we are convinced’ now. But none of this is of any use to them and they will not be sent back the response to the conditional clause beginning with law ‘if’ is an implicit ‘you would see a terrible thing’.
وَلَوْ شِئْنَا لآتَيْنَا كُلَّ نَفْسٍ هُدَاهَا وَلَـٰكِنْ حَقَّ ٱلْقَوْلُ مِنِّي لأَمْلأَنَّ جَهَنَّمَ مِنَ ٱلْجِنَّةِ وَٱلنَّاسِ أَجْمَعِينَ,God exalted be He says ‘And had We so willed We could have given every soul its means to guidance so that it may be guided through faith and obedience through its own choice but My Word became due and it is that “Verily I shall fill Hell with jinn and mankind together”.
فَذُوقُواْ بِمَا نَسِيتُمْ لِقَآءَ يَوْمِكُمْ هَـٰذَآ إِنَّا نَسِينَاكُمْ وَذُوقُـواْ عَذَابَ ٱلْخُلْدِ بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ,When they enter Hell its Keepers shall say to them So taste now the chastisement for your having forgotten the encounter of this day of yours in other words for your having neglected to believe in it. We too shall forget you we shall abandon you in the chastisement. And taste now the everlasting chastisement for what you used to practise’ of disbelief and denial.
إِنَّمَا يُؤْمِنُ بِآيَاتِنَا ٱلَّذِينَ إِذَا ذُكِّرُواْ بِهَا خَرُّواْ سُجَّداً وَسَبَّحُواْ بِحَمْدِ رَبِّهِمْ وَهُمْ لاَ يَسْتَكْبِرُونَ,Only those believe in Our signs such as the Qur’ān who when they are reminded of them admonished with them fall down in prostration and make glorifications ensconced in praise of their Lord in other words they say ‘Glory be to God through His praise’ subhāna’Llāh wa-bi-hāmdihi and they do not disdain to believe and to obey.
تَتَجَافَىٰ جُنُوبُهُمْ عَنِ ٱلْمَضَاجِعِ يَدْعُونَ رَبَّهُمْ خَوْفاً وَطَمَعاً وَمِمَّا رَزَقْنَاهُمْ يُنفِقُونَ,Their sides withdraw they rise from their lying places the places for lying down to sleep together with the bedding in order to spend the night in prayer tahajjud to supplicate to their Lord in fear of His punishment and in hope of His mercy and they expend of what We have provided them they give voluntary alms.
فَلاَ تَعْلَمُ نَفْسٌ مَّآ أُخْفِيَ لَهُم مِّن قُرَّةِ أَعْيُنٍ جَزَآءً بِمَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ,For no soul knows what has been kept hidden for them in the way of joyous sights a variant reading for ukhfiya has the imperfect tense ukhfī as a reward for what they used to do.
أَفَمَن كَانَ مُؤْمِناً كَمَن كَانَ فَاسِقاً لاَّ يَسْتَوُونَ,Is he who is a believer like him who is a transgressor? They are not equal namely the believers and the transgressors.
أَمَّا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ فَلَهُمْ جَنَّاتُ ٱلْمَأْوَىٰ نُزُلاً بِمَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ,As for those who believe and perform righteous deeds for them shall be the Gardens of the Abode — a hospitality nuzul is what is prepared for a guest for what they used to do.
وَأَمَّا ٱلَّذِينَ فَسَقُواْ فَمَأْوَاهُمُ ٱلنَّارُ كُلَّمَآ أَرَادُوۤاْ أَن يَخْرُجُواُ مِنْهَآ أُعِيدُواْ فِيهَا وَقِيلَ لَهُمْ ذُوقُواْ عَذَابَ ٱلنَّارِ ٱلَّذِي كُنتُمْ بِهِ تُكَذِّبُونَ,But as for those who transgressed by disbelieving and denying their abode shall be the Fire. Whenever they seek to exit from it they shall be brought back into it and it shall be said to them ‘Taste the chastisement of the Fire which you used to deny’.
وَلَنُذِيقَنَّهُمْ مِّنَ ٱلْعَذَابِ ٱلأَدْنَىٰ دُونَ ٱلْعَذَابِ ٱلأَكْبَرِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ,And We shall surely make them taste the nearer chastisement that is the chastisement of this world — in their being killed or taken captive or through years of drought and disease — before the greater chastisement the chastisement of the Hereafter that perhaps they namely those remaining of them may return to belief.
وَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّن ذُكِّرَ بِآيَاتِ رَبِّهِ ثُمَّ أَعْرَضَ عَنْهَآ إِنَّا مِنَ ٱلْمُجْرِمِينَ مُنتَقِمُونَ,And who does greater wrong than he who is reminded of the signs of his Lord such as the Qur’ān but then turns away from them? in other words none does greater wrong than such a person. Assuredly We shall take vengeance upon the criminals the idolaters.
وَلَقَدْ آتَيْنَا مُوسَى ٱلْكِتَابَ فَلاَ تَكُن فِي مِرْيَةٍ مِّن لِّقَآئِهِ وَجَعَلْنَاهُ هُدًى لِّبَنِيۤ إِسْرَائِيلَ,And verily We gave Moses the Scripture the Torah; so do not be in doubt concerning the encounter with Him and indeed he and He met on the Night of the Journey; and We appointed him namely Moses — or read ‘We appointed it’ the Scripture a guidance for the Children of Israel.
وَجَعَلْنَا مِنْهُمْ أَئِمَّةً يَهْدُونَ بِأَمْرِنَا لَمَّا صَبَرُواْ وَكَانُواْ بِآيَاتِنَا يُوقِنُونَ,And We appointed among them leaders read a-immatan by pronouncing both hamzas or by substituting the second one with a yā who guided people by Our command when they had endured patiently in observing their religion and against the hardships they suffered because of their enemies lammā ‘when’ a variant reading has limā ‘because’ and had conviction in Our signs the ones indicating Our power and Our Oneness.
إِنَّ رَبَّكَ هُوَ يَفْصِلُ بَيْنَهُمْ يَوْمَ ٱلْقَيَامَةِ فِيمَا كَانُواْ فِيهِ يَخْتَلِفُونَ,Surely your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that wherein they used to differ in matters of religion.
أَوَلَمْ يَهْدِ لَهُمْ كَمْ أَهْلَكْنَا مِن قَبْلِهِمْ مِّنَ ٱلْقُرُونِ يَمْشُونَ فِي مَسَاكِنِهِمْ إِنَّ فِي ذَلِكَ لآيَاتٍ أَفَلاَ يَسْمَعُونَ,Or is it not an indication for them how many generations communities on account of their disbelief We destroyed before them that is to say has not Our destruction of many generations become clear to the disbelievers of Mecca amid whose dwellings they walk yamshūna is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the person of the pronoun lahum ‘for them’ during their travels to Syria and other places so that they might take heed? Surely in that there are signs indications of Our power. Are they not able to hear? in a way so as to reflect and be admonished.
أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْاْ أَنَّا نَسُوقُ ٱلْمَآءَ إِلَى ٱلأَرْضِ ٱلْجُرُزِ فَنُخْرِجُ بِهِ زَرْعاً تَأْكُلُ مِنْهُ أَنْعَامُهُمْ وَأَنفُسُهُمْ أَفَلاَ يُبْصِرُونَ,Or have they not seen how We drive the water to barren land juruz this is arid land that contains no vegetation and therewith bring forth crops whereof their cattle and they themselves eat? Can they not see? this and so realise that We have the power to bring them back to life after death.
وَيَقُولُونَ مَتَىٰ هَـٰذَا ٱلْفَتْحُ إِن كُنتُمْ صَادِقِينَ,And they say to the believers ‘When will this decisive Judgement between us and yourselves be if you are truthful?’
قُلْ يَوْمَ ٱلْفَتْحِ لاَ يَنفَعُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوۤاْ إِيَمَانُهُمْ وَلاَ هُمْ يُنظَرُونَ,Say ‘On the day of this Judgement which will be effected by sending the chastisement on them their newly found faith then shall not benefit those who had been disbelievers nor shall they be given respite to make repentance or offer excuses.
فَأَعْرِضْ عَنْهُمْ وَٱنتَظِرْ إِنَّهُمْ مُّنتَظِرُونَ,So turn away from them and wait for the chastisement to be sent down on them. They too are waiting for your death to take place or for you to be killed and so be rid of you — this was revealed before the command to fight them.
يَٰأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّبِيُّ ٱتَّقِ ٱللَّهَ وَلاَ تُطِعِ ٱلْكَافِرِينَ وَٱلْمُنَافِقِينَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ عَلِيماً حَكِيماً,O Prophet! Fear God remain in fear of Him and do not obey the disbelievers and the hypocrites and so follow them in what contravenes your Law. Truly God is Knower of what will happens before it happens Wise in what He creates.
وَٱتَّبِعْ مَا يُوحَىٰ إِلَـيْكَ مِن رَبِّكَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيراً,And follow what is revealed to you from your Lord namely the Qur’ān. Truly God is Aware of what you do ta‘malūna; a variant reading has ya‘malūna ‘what they do’.
وَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَىٰ ٱللَّهِ وَكَفَىٰ بِٱللَّهِ وَكِيلاً,And put your trust in God regarding this affair of yours; and God suffices as Guardian to preserve you. And the members of his the Prophet’s community are subject to the same admonitions in all of the above.
مَّا جَعَلَ ٱللَّهُ لِرَجُلٍ مِّن قَلْبَيْنِ فِي جَوْفِهِ وَمَا جَعَلَ أَزْوَاجَكُمُ ٱللاَّئِي تُظَاهِرُونَ مِنْهُنَّ أُمَّهَاتِكُمْ وَمَا جَعَلَ أَدْعِيَآءَكُمْ أَبْنَآءَكُمْ ذَٰلِكُمْ قَوْلُكُم بِأَفْوَاهِكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ يَقُولُ ٱلْحَقَّ وَهُوَ يَهْدِي ٱلسَّبِيلَ,God has not placed two hearts inside any man this was revealed in order to refute those disbelievers who said that they each had two hearts with which they could reason better than Muhammad’s single mind; nor has He made your wives whom read as allā’ī or allā’ you repudiate by zihār read tazzahharūna or tuzāhirūna; the original tā’ of tatazāharūna has been assimilated with the zā’ — a man would say to his wife for example ‘You are for me as untouchable as my mother’s back’ — your mothers in other words He has not made you wives like your mothers so that they are illicit for conjugality in that respect a practice which in pre-Islamic times was considered a valid form of divorce. An atonement with necessary conditions is necessary in such a case as mentioned in sūrat al-Mujādila Q. 582-3. Nor has He made those whom you claim as adopted sons ad‘iyā’ the plural of da‘iyy which is one claimed as the son of one who is not his biological father your sons in reality. That is a mere utterance of your mouths namely of the Jews and the hypocrites. When the Prophet s married Zaynab bt. Jahsh who had been Zayd b. Hāritha’s wife the adopted son of the Prophet s they said ‘Muhammad married his son’s wife!’ and so God proved them liars in this. But God speaks the truth in this matter and He guides to the way the way of truth.
ٱدْعُوهُمْ لآبَآئِهِمْ هُوَ أَقْسَطُ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ فَإِن لَّمْ تَعْلَمُوۤاْ آبَاءَهُمْ فَإِخوَانُكُمْ فِي ٱلدِّينِ وَمَوَالِيكُمْ وَلَيْسَ عَلَيْكُمْ جُنَاحٌ فِيمَآ أَخْطَأْتُمْ بِهِ وَلَـٰكِن مَّا تَعَمَّدَتْ قُلُوبُكُمْ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ غَفُوراً رَّحِيماً,Instead attribute them to their true fathers. That is more equitable that is more just in the sight of God. If you do not know their true fathers then they are your brethren in religion and as your associates. And you would not be at fault for any mistake you make in this respect except in what your hearts may premeditate after the prohibition has been issued. And God is Forgiving of whatever you said before the prohibition was issued Merciful to you in this respect.
ٱلنَّبِيُّ أَوْلَىٰ بِٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ مِنْ أَنْفُسِهِمْ وَأَزْوَاجُهُ أُمَّهَاتُهُمْ وَأُوْلُواْ ٱلأَرْحَامِ بَعْضُهُمْ أَوْلَىٰ بِبَعْضٍ فِي كِتَابِ ٱللَّهِ مِنَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَٱلْمُهَاجِرِينَ إِلاَّ أَن تَفْعَلُوۤاْ إِلَىٰ أَوْلِيَآئِكُمْ مَّعْرُوفاً كَانَ ذَلِكَ فِي ٱلْكِتَابِ مَسْطُوراً,The Prophet is closer to the believers than their own souls in terms of what he calls them to and what their own souls have called them to contravene and his wives are their mothers insofar as they the believers are forbidden to marry them. And those related by blood kinsmen are more entitled to inherit from one another in the Book of God than the other believers and the Emigrants in other words than inheriting on account of their sharing faith and the Emigration which had been the case at the beginning of Islam but was then abrogated; barring any favour you may do your friends by making a bequest which is permissible. This namely the abrogation of inheritance on account of shared faith and Emigration by the inheritance on account of kinship is written in the Book — in both instances al-kitāb ‘the Book’ denotes the Preserved Tablet al-lawh al-mahfūz.
وَإِذْ أَخَذْنَا مِنَ ٱلنَّبِيِّيْنَ مِيثَاقَهُمْ وَمِنْكَ وَمِن نُّوحٍ وَإِبْرَاهِيمَ وَمُوسَىٰ وَعِيسَى ٱبْنِ مَرْيَمَ وَأَخَذْنَا مِنْهُمْ مِّيثَاقاً غَلِيظاً,And mention when We took a pledge from the prophets at the point when they were brought forth from the loins of Adam the size of atoms and from you and from Noah and Abraham and Moses and Jesus son of Mary that they worship only God and call others to worship Him the mention of the five names is an instance of supplementing the specific to the general. And We took from them a solemn pledge a solid one that they fulfil what they have been charged with and this was effected by swearing an oath to God after which the pledge was consummated;
لِّيَسْأَلَ ٱلصَّادِقِينَ عَن صِدْقِهِمْ وَأَعَدَّ لِلْكَافِرِينَ عَذَاباً أَلِيماً,that He God may question the truthful about their truthfulness in delivering the Message as a way thereby to justifiably reproach the disbelievers; and He exalted be He has prepared for those who disbelieve in them a painful chastisement ‘adhāban alīman is a supplement to akhadhnā ‘We took’.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ ٱذْكُرُواْ نِعْمَةَ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ إِذْ جَآءَتْكُمْ جُنُودٌ فَأَرْسَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ رِيحاً وَجُنُوداً لَّمْ تَرَوْهَا وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيراً,O you who believe! Remember God’s favour to you when hosts of disbelievers came against you as confederates at the time the Ditch al-khandaq was being dug and We unleashed against them a great wind and hosts of angels you did not see. And God is ever Seer of what you do read ta‘malūna to imply ‘in the way of your digging of the ditch’; or read ya‘malūna ‘of what they do’ to imply ‘the idolaters’ forming of a confederation’.
إِذْ جَآءُوكُمْ مِّن فَوْقِكُمْ وَمِنْ أَسْفَلَ مِنكُمْ وَإِذْ زَاغَتِ ٱلأَبْصَارُ وَبَلَغَتِ ٱلْقُلُوبُ ٱلْحَنَاجِرَ وَتَظُنُّونَ بِٱللَّهِ ٱلظُّنُونَاْ,When they came at you from above you and from below you in other words from the higher side of the valley and from its lower side from the east and from the west and when the eyes turned away in fear from everything to gaze at their enemies approaching from every side and the hearts lept to the throats hanājir the plural of hunjura which lies at the bottom of the gullet out of intense fear while you entertained all sorts of different thoughts concerning God some of assistance some of despair;
هُنَالِكَ ٱبْتُلِيَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ وَزُلْزِلُواْ زِلْزَالاً شَدِيداً,it was there that the believers were sorely tried there they were tested to distinguish the sincere individual from the one otherwise and were shaken with a mighty shock because of the severity of the terror.
وَإِذْ يَقُولُ ٱلْمُنَافِقُونَ وَٱلَّذِينَ فِي قُلُوبِهِم مَّرَضٌ مَّا وَعَدَنَا ٱللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُ إِلاَّ غُرُوراً,And mention when the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is sickness namely weakness of conviction were saying ‘What God and His Messenger promised us of assistance to victory was nothing but delusion’ falsehood.
وَإِذْ قَالَت طَّآئِفَةٌ مِّنْهُمْ يٰأَهْلَ يَثْرِبَ لاَ مُقَامَ لَكُمْ فَٱرْجِعُواْ وَيَسْتَئْذِنُ فَرِيقٌ مِّنْهُمُ ٱلنَّبِيَّ يَقُولُونَ إِنَّ بُيُوتَنَا عَوْرَةٌ وَمَا هِيَ بِعَوْرَةٍ إِن يُرِيدُونَ إِلاَّ فِرَاراً,And when a party of them namely the hypocrites said ‘O people of Yathrib! namely the region of Medina it Yathriba is a diptote because of its being a proper noun and because of the morphological similarity it bears to a verbal form there is not a stand possible read muqām or maqām for you here in other words no place to stay and no strategic position so turn back to your dwellings in Medina — they had set out with the Prophet s towards the foot of a mountain outside Medina for battle. And a group of them even sought the permission of the Prophet to turn back saying ‘Our homes are exposed unprotected and we fear for them’. God exalted be He says although they were not exposed. They only sought to flee from battle.
وَلَوْ دُخِلَتْ عَلَيْهِمْ مِّنْ أَقْطَارِهَا ثُمَّ سُئِلُواْ ٱلْفِتْنَةَ لآتَوْهَا وَمَا تَلَبَّثُواْ بِهَآ إِلاَّ يَسِيراً,And had they been invaded in it namely Medina from all sides and had they been exhorted in other words had the invaders exhorted them to treachery a return to idolatrous ways they would have committed it read la-ātawhā or la-atawhā meaning ‘they would have offered it’ or ‘they would have committed it’ respectively and would have hesitated thereupon but a little.
وَلَقَدْ كَانُواْ عَاهَدُواْ ٱللَّهَ مِن قَبْلُ لاَ يُوَلُّونَ ٱلأَدْبَارَ وَكَانَ عَهْدُ ٱللَّهِ مَسْئُولاً,Though they had assuredly pledged to God before that that they would not turn their backs to flee; and a pledge given to God must be answered for regarding whether it was fulfilled or not.
قُل لَّن يَنفَعَكُمُ ٱلْفِرَارُ إِن فَرَرْتُمْ مِّنَ ٱلْمَوْتِ أَوِ ٱلْقَتْلِ وَإِذاً لاَّ تُمَتَّعُونَ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً,Say ‘Flight will not avail you should you flee from death or from being slain and then if you were to flee you would not be extended comfort in this world after you have fled except a little’ except for the remainder of your terms of life.
قُلْ مَن ذَا ٱلَّذِي يَعْصِمُكُمْ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ إِنْ أَرَادَ بِكُمْ سُوۤءاً أَوْ أَرَادَ بِكُمْ رَحْمَةً وَلاَ يَجِدُونَ لَهُمْ مِّن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ وَلِيّاً وَلاَ نَصِيراً,Say ‘Who is it that can protect you grant you sanctuary from God should He desire to cause you ill whether it be destruction or defeat or who is it that can cause you ill should He God desire for you mercy?’ good. And they shall not find for themselves besides God in other words other than God any protector to avail them or helper to ward off harm from them.
قَدْ يَعْلَمُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْمُعَوِّقِينَ مِنكُمْ وَٱلْقَآئِلِينَ لإِخْوَانِهِمْ هَلُمَّ إِلَيْنَا وَلاَ يَأْتُونَ ٱلْبَأْسَ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً,Indeed God already knows the hinderers among you and those who say to their brethren ‘Come to us’ and they do not engage in the battle except a little for show and for the sake of their reputation
أَشِحَّةً عَلَيْكُمْ فَإِذَا جَآءَ ٱلْخَوْفُ رَأَيْتَهُمْ يَنظُرُونَ إِلَيْكَ تَدُورُ أَعْيُنُهُمْ كَٱلَّذِي يُغْشَىٰ عَلَيْهِ مِنَ ٱلْمَوْتِ فَإِذَا ذَهَبَ ٱلْخَوْفُ سَلَقُوكُمْ بِأَلْسِنَةٍ حِدَادٍ أَشِحَّةً عَلَى ٱلْخَيْرِ أوْلَـٰئِكَ لَمْ يُؤْمِنُواْ فَأَحْبَطَ ٱللَّهُ أَعْمَالَهُمْ وَكَانَ ذَلِكَ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ يَسِيراً,grudging to you in their help ashihha ‘grudging’ is the plural of shahīh and is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the subject of the verb ya’tūna ‘they engage’. And when there is a panic you see them looking at you their eyes rolling like one that is like the look of one or the rolling of one fainting at death in other words one in the throes thereof; but when the panic subsides and the spoils have been secured they scald you they hurt you or they smite you with their sharp tongues in their greed for the riches in other words for the spoils which they demand greedily. Those they never believed really. Therefore God has invalidated their works and that invalidation is easy for God by His will.
يَحْسَبُونَ ٱلأَحْزَابَ لَمْ يَذْهَبُواْ وَإِن يَأْتِ ٱلأَحْزَابُ يَوَدُّواْ لَوْ أَنَّهُمْ بَادُونَ فِي ٱلأَعْرَابِ يَسْأَلُونَ عَنْ أَنبَآئِكُمْ وَلَوْ كَانُواْ فِيكُمْ مَّا قَاتَلُوۤاْ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً,They suppose that the confederates of disbelievers have not yet departed to Mecca because of their fear of them and were the confederates to come a second time they would wish that they were in the desert with the Bedouins asking about your news your encounters with the disbelievers. And if they were among you this second time they would fight but a little for show and for fear of being reviled.
لَّقَدْ كَانَ لَكُمْ فِي رَسُولِ ٱللَّهِ أُسْوَةٌ حَسَنَةٌ لِّمَن كَانَ يَرْجُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَٱلْيَوْمَ ٱلآخِرَ وَذَكَرَ ٱللَّهَ كَثِيراً,Verily there is for you a good example read iswa or uswa in the Messenger of God to emulate in combat and in holding one’s ground therein for whoever li-man substitutes for lakum ‘for you’ hopes for the encounter with God fears Him and the Last Day and remembers God often in contrast to those who do not.
وَلَمَّا رَأَى ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ ٱلأَحْزَابَ قَالُواْ هَـٰذَا مَا وَعَدَنَا ٱللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُ وَصَدَقَ ٱللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُ وَمَا زَادَهُمْ إِلاَّ إِيمَاناً وَتَسْلِيماً,And when the believers saw the confederates of disbelievers they said ‘This is what God and His Messenger promised us in the way of trial and assistance to victory and God and His Messenger were truthful’ about the promise. And that only increased them in faith in belief in God’s promise and submission to His command.
مِّنَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ رِجَالٌ صَدَقُواْ مَا عَاهَدُواْ ٱللَّهَ عَلَيْهِ فَمِنْهُمْ مَّن قَضَىٰ نَحْبَهُ وَمِنْهُمْ مَّن يَنتَظِرُ وَمَا بَدَّلُواْ تَبْدِيلاً,Among the believers are men who are true to the covenant they made with God in steadfastly remaining alongside the Prophet s. Some of them have fulfilled their vow having died or been killed fighting for God’s cause and some are still awaiting for this fate and they have not changed their commitment to the covenant in the least and they stand in contrast to the situation with the hypocrites;
لِّيَجْزِيَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلصَّادِقِينَ بِصِدْقِهِمْ وَيُعَذِّبَ ٱلْمُنَافِقِينَ إِن شَآءَ أَوْ يَتُوبَ عَلَيْهِمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ غَفُوراً رَّحِيماً,that God may reward the truthful for their truthfulness and chastise the hypocrites if He will by causing them to die in a state of hypocrisy or relent to them. Surely God is Forgiving to he who repents Merciful to him.
وَرَدَّ ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ بِغَيْظِهِمْ لَمْ يَنَالُواْ خَيْراً وَكَفَى ٱللَّهُ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ ٱلْقِتَالَ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ قَوِيّاً عَزِيزاً,And God repulsed those who were disbelievers namely the confederates in their rage without their attaining any good without achieving their desire in any way to triumph over the believers. And God spared the believers from fighting by unleashing the wind and the angels. And truly God is Strong in bringing about what He wants Mighty prevailing with His way.
وَأَنزَلَ ٱلَّذِينَ ظَاهَرُوهُم مِّنْ أَهْلِ ٱلْكِتَابِ مِن صَيَاصِيهِمْ وَقَذَفَ فِي قُلُوبِهِمُ ٱلرُّعْبَ فَرِيقاً تَقْتُلُونَ وَتَأْسِرُونَ فَرِيقاً,And He brought down those of the People of the Scripture namely the Banū Qurayza who had supported them from their strongholds sayāsī is the plural of sīsa and is that in which one fortifies himself against an enemy and He cast terror into their hearts so that some of them you slew and these were the combatants and some of them you took captive namely their children.
وَأَوْرَثَكُمْ أَرْضَهُمْ وَدِيَارَهُمْ وَأَمْوَالَهُمْ وَأَرْضاً لَّمْ تَطَئُوهَا وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيراً,And He made you inherit their land and their homes and their possessions and a land you had not trodden thitherto and this was the territory of Khaybar which was captured after that of Qurayza. And God has power over all things.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّبِيُّ قُل لأَزْوَاجِكَ إِن كُنتُنَّ تُرِدْنَ ٱلْحَيَاةَ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَزِينَتَهَا فَتَعَالَيْنَ أُمَتِّعْكُنَّ وَأُسَرِّحْكُنَّ سَرَاحاً جَمِيلاً,O Prophet! Say to your wives — who were nine and they had asked him for some of the adornments of this world which he did not possess — ‘If you desire the life of this world and its adornment come now I will provide for you in other words the compensation to be provided for divorce and release you in a gracious manner I will divorce you and will not coerce you to stay.
وَإِن كُنتُنَّ تُرِدْنَ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ وَٱلدَّارَ ٱلآخِرَةَ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ أَعَدَّ لِلْمُحْسِنَاتِ مِنكُنَّ أَجْراً عَظِيماً,But if you desire God and His Messenger and the Abode of the Hereafter namely Paradise then God has indeed prepared for the virtuous among you virtuous for desiring the Hereafter a great reward’ namely Paradise so choose the Hereafter over the life of this world.
يٰنِسَآءَ ٱلنَّبِيِّ مَن يَأْتِ مِنكُنَّ بِفَاحِشَةٍ مُّبَيِّنَةٍ يُضَاعَفْ لَهَا ٱلْعَذَابُ ضِعْفَيْنِ وَكَانَ ذَلِكَ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ يَسِيراً,O wives of the Prophet! Whoever of you commits manifest indecency read mubayyana or mubayyina meaning respectively ‘it has become evident’ meaning ‘one that is evident’ the chastisement shall be doubled yudā‘af a variant reading has 2nd form yuda‘‘af and still another has nuda‘‘if ‘We shall double’ in which case read al-‘adhāba as accusative for her in other words twice the chastisement for other women; and that is easy for God.
وَمَن يَقْنُتْ مِنكُنَّ للَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ وَتَعْمَلْ صَالِحاً نُؤْتِهَـآ أَجْرَهَا مَرَّتَيْنِ وَأَعْتَدْنَا لَهَا رِزْقاً كَرِيماً,But whoever of you is obedient to God and His Messenger and acts righteously We shall give her a twofold reward in other words twice the reward for other women variant readings for ta‘mal and nu’tihā are impersonal ya‘mal ‘whoever acts’ and yu’tihā ‘He will give her’. And We have prepared a noble provision for her in Paradise in addition to the twofold reward.
يٰنِسَآءَ ٱلنَّبِيِّ لَسْتُنَّ كَأَحَدٍ مِّنَ ٱلنِّسَآءِ إِنِ ٱتَّقَيْتُنَّ فَلاَ تَخْضَعْنَ بِٱلْقَوْلِ فَيَطْمَعَ ٱلَّذِي فِي قَلْبِهِ مَرَضٌ وَقُلْنَ قَوْلاً مَّعْرُوفاً,O wives of the Prophet! You are not like any other group of women. If you fear God for you are more exalted in status then do not be complaisant in your speech with men lest he in whose heart is a sickness hypocrisy aspire to you but speak honourable words without any complaisance.
وَقَرْنَ فِي بُيُوتِكُنَّ وَلاَ تَبَرَّجْنَ تَبَرُّجَ ٱلْجَاهِلِيَّةِ ٱلأُولَىٰ وَأَقِمْنَ ٱلصَّلاَةَ وَآتِينَ ٱلزَّكَـاةَ وَأَطِعْنَ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ إِنَّمَا يُرِيدُ ٱللَّهُ لِيُذْهِبَ عَنكُـمُ ٱلرِّجْسَ أَهْلَ ٱلْبَيْتِ وَيُطَهِّرَكُمْ تَطْهِيـراً,And stay in your houses read qirna or qarna derived from al-qarār and is actually aqrirna or aqrarna from qarirtu or qarartu the vowelling of the rā’ is moved to the qāf and the rā’ is omitted together with the conjunctive hamza and do not flaunt your finery tabarrajna with one of the two original tā’ of tatabarrajna letters omitted in the flaunting manner of the former Time of Ignorance in other words before Islam when they used to display their beauty to men — the stipulation regarding such ‘displays’ after the coming of Islam is mentioned in the verse and not to display their adornment except what is apparent Q. 2431. And maintain prayer and pay the alms and obey God and His Messenger. Indeed God will but to rid you of sin O People of the House in other words O women of the Prophet s and to purify you of it with a thorough purification.
وَٱذْكُـرْنَ مَا يُتْـلَىٰ فِي بُيُوتِكُـنَّ مِنْ آيَاتِ ٱللَّهِ وَٱلْحِكْـمَةِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ لَطِيفاً خَبِيراً,And remember that which is recited in your houses of the revelations of God of the Qur’ān and wisdom the Sunna. Truly God is Kind to His friends Aware of all His creatures.
إِنَّ ٱلْمُسْلِمِينَ وَٱلْمُسْلِمَاتِ وَٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَٱلْمُؤْمِنَاتِ وَٱلْقَانِتِينَ وَٱلْقَانِتَاتِ وَٱلصَّادِقِينَ وَٱلصَّادِقَاتِ وَٱلصَّابِرِينَ وَٱلصَّابِرَاتِ وَٱلْخَاشِعِينَ وَٱلْخَاشِعَاتِ وَٱلْمُتَصَدِّقِينَ وَٱلْمُتَصَدِّقَاتِ وٱلصَّائِمِينَ وٱلصَّائِمَاتِ وَٱلْحَافِظِينَ فُرُوجَهُمْ وَٱلْحَافِـظَاتِ وَٱلذَّاكِـرِينَ ٱللَّهَ كَثِيراً وَٱلذَّاكِرَاتِ أَعَدَّ ٱللَّهُ لَهُم مَّغْفِرَةً وَأَجْراً عَظِيماً,Indeed the men who have submitted to God and the women who have submitted to God and the believing men and the believing women and the obedient men and the obedient women and the men who are truthful and the women who are truthful in their faith and the patient men and the patient women steadfast in performing acts of obedience and the humble men and the humble women and the charitable men and the charitable women and the men who fast and the women who fast and the men who guard their private parts and the women who guard their private parts from what is unlawful and the men who remember God often and the women who remember God often — for them God has prepared forgiveness of their acts of disobedience and a great reward for their acts of obedience.
وَمَا كَانَ لِمُؤْمِنٍ وَلاَ مُؤْمِنَةٍ إِذَا قَضَى ٱللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُ أَمْراً أَن يَكُونَ لَهُمُ ٱلْخِيَرَةُ مِنْ أَمْرِهِمْ وَمَن يَعْصِ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ فَقَدْ ضَلَّ ضَلاَلاً مُّبِيناً,And it is not fitting for any believing man or believing woman when God and His Messenger have decided on a matter to have read takūna or yakūna a choice in their matter in contravention of the decision of God and His Messenger. This verse was revealed regarding ‘Abd Allāh b. Jahsh and his sister Zaynab whose hand the Prophet had asked for in marriage but meaning on behalf of Zayd b. Hāritha. They were loathe to this proposal when they found out that it was on the latter’s behalf for they had thought that the Prophet s wanted to marry her himself. But afterwards they consented because of the following part of the verse And whoever disobeys God and His Messenger has certainly strayed into manifest error. Thus the Prophet s gave her in marriage to Zayd. Then on one occasion he the Prophet caught sight of her and felt love for her whereafter when he realised that Zayd lost his affection for her and so said to the Prophet s ‘I want to part with her’. But the Prophet said to him ‘Retain your wife for yourself’ as God exalted be He says
وَإِذْ تَقُولُ لِلَّذِيۤ أَنعَمَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَأَنْعَمْتَ عَلَيْهِ أَمْسِكْ عَلَيْكَ زَوْجَكَ وَٱتَّقِ ٱللَّهَ وَتُخْفِي فِي نَفْسِكَ مَا ٱللَّهُ مُبْدِيهِ وَتَخْشَى ٱلنَّاسَ وَٱللَّهُ أَحَقُّ أَن تَخْشَاهُ فَلَمَّا قَضَىٰ زَيْدٌ مِّنْهَا وَطَراً زَوَّجْنَاكَهَا لِكَيْ لاَ يَكُونَ عَلَى ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ حَرَجٌ فِيۤ أَزْوَاجِ أَدْعِيَآئِهِمْ إِذَا قَضَوْاْ مِنْهُنَّ وَطَراً وَكَانَ أَمْرُ ٱللَّهِ مَفْعُولاً,And when idh is dependent because of an implied preceding udhkur ‘mention when’ you said to him to whom God had shown favour by guiding him to Islam and to whom you too had shown favour by manumitting him — this was Zayd b. Hāritha who had been a prisoner of war before the coming of Islam in the period of al-jāhiliyya. The Messenger of God s purchased him before his call to prophethood and then manumitted him and adopted him as his son — ‘Retain your wife for yourself and fear God’ before divorcing her. But you had hidden in your heart what God was to disclose what He was to manifest of your love for her and of the fact that should Zayd part with her you would marry her and you feared people would say ‘He has married his son’s wife!’ though God is worthier that you should fear Him in all things so take her in marriage and do not be concerned with what people say. Zayd subsequently divorced her and her obligatory waiting period was completed. God exalted be He says So when Zayd had fulfilled whatever need he had of her We joined her in marriage to you — the Prophet consummated his marriage with her without the customary permission from her legal guardian and gratified the Muslims with a feast of bread and meat — so that there may not be any restriction for the believers in respect of the wives of their adopted sons when the latter have fulfilled whatever wish they have of them. And God’s commandment that which He has decreed is bound to be realised.
مَّا كَانَ عَلَى ٱلنَّبِيِّ مِنْ حَرَجٍ فِيمَا فَرَضَ ٱللَّهُ لَهُ سُنَّةَ ٱللَّهِ فِي ٱلَّذِينَ خَلَوْاْ مِن قَبْلُ وَكَانَ أَمْرُ ٱللَّهِ قَدَراً مَّقْدُوراً,There is no restriction for the Prophet in what God has ordained in what He has made lawful for him that is God’s precedent sunnata’Llāhi is in the accusative because the operator of the oblique has been removed from the oblique construction ka-sunnati’Llāhi ‘as is God’s precedent’ with those who passed away before of prophets which is that there is no restriction for them in this respect a special dispensation for them regarding marriage — and God’s commandment what He does is inexorable destiny
ٱلَّذِينَ يُبَلِّغُونَ رِسَالاَتِ ٱللَّهِ وَيَخْشَوْنَهُ وَلاَ يَخْشَوْنَ أَحَداً إِلاَّ ٱللَّهَ وَكَفَىٰ بِٱللَّهِ حَسِيباً,— those who alladhīna qualifies the previous alladhīna deliver the Messages of God and fear Him and fear no one except Him and therefore they do not fear what people might say about that which God has made lawful for them. And God suffices as Reckoner as keeper of the deeds of His creatures and as One to reckon with them.
مَّا كَانَ مُحَمَّدٌ أَبَآ أَحَدٍ مِّن رِّجَالِكُمْ وَلَـٰكِن رَّسُولَ ٱللَّهِ وَخَاتَمَ ٱلنَّبِيِّينَ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عَلِيماً,Muhammad is not the father of any man among you he is not Zayd’s biological father and so it is not unlawful for him to marry his former wife Zaynab after him; but he is the Messenger of God and the Seal of the Prophets and so he will not have a son that is a fully grown man to be a prophet after him a variant reading for khātim al-nabiyyīna has khātam al-nabiyyīn as in the instrument known as a ‘seal’ in other words their prophethood has been sealed by him. And God has knowledge of all things among these is the fact that there will be no prophet after him and even when the lord Jesus descends at the end of days he will rule according to his Muhammad’s Law.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ ٱذْكُرُواْ ٱللَّهَ ذِكْراً كَثِيراً,O you who believe! Remember God with much remembrance.
وَسَبِّحُوهُ بُكْرَةً وَأَصِيلاً,And glorify Him morning and evening in other words at the beginning of the day and at the end of it.
هُوَ ٱلَّذِي يُصَلِّي عَلَيْكُمْ وَمَلاَئِكَتُهُ لِيُخْرِجَكُمْ مِّنَ ٱلظُّلُمَاتِ إِلَى ٱلنُّورِ وَكَانَ بِٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ رَحِيماً,It is He Who blesses you that is to say Who shows mercy to you and His angels ask forgiveness for you that He may bring you forth that He may always bring you forth from darkness namely from disbelief into light namely faith. And He is Merciful to the believers.
تَحِيَّتُهُمْ يَوْمَ يَلْقَوْنَهُ سَلاَمٌ وَأَعَدَّ لَهُمْ أَجْراً كَرِيماً,Their greeting from Him exalted be He on the day they encounter Him will be ‘Peace’ extended to them by the tongues of the angels. And He has prepared for them a noble reward namely Paradise.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّبِيُّ إِنَّآ أَرْسَلْنَٰكَ شَٰهِداً وَمُبَشِّراً وَنَذِيراً,O Prophet! Indeed We have sent you as a witness against those to whom you have were sent and as a bearer of good tidings for those who affirm your sincerity of Paradise and as a warner for those who deny you of the punishment of the Fire
وَدَاعِياً إِلَى ٱللَّهِ بِإِذْنِهِ وَسِرَاجاً مُّنِيراً,and as a summoner to God to obedience to Him by His leave by His command and as a illuminating lamp in other words the equivalent of it in terms of one’s being able to find guidance therewith.
وَبَشِّرِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ بِأَنَّ لَهُمْ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ فَضْلاً كَبِيراً,And give good tidings to the believers that there will be for them a great bounty from God namely Paradise.
وَلاَ تُطِعِ ٱلْكَافِرِينَ وَٱلْمُنَافِقِينَ وَدَعْ أَذَاهُمْ وَتَوَكَّـلْ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ وَكَفَىٰ بِٱللَّهِ وَكِـيلاً,And do not obey the disbelievers and the hypocrites in assenting to do what contravenes your Law; and disregard leave aside their injuriousness — do not retaliate against them for it until you receive a command from God regarding how to deal with them. And put your trust in God for He will suffice you and God suffices as Guardian One to Whom matters are entrusted.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُوۤاْ إِذَا نَكَحْتُمُ ٱلْمُؤْمِنَاتِ ثُمَّ طَلَّقْتُمُوهُنَّ مِن قَبْلِ أَن تَمَسُّوهُنَّ فَمَا لَكُمْ عَلَيْهِنَّ مِنْ عِدَّةٍ تَعْتَدُّونَهَا فَمَتِّعُوهُنَّ وَسَرِّحُوهُنَّ سَرَاحاً جَمِيلاً,O you who believe if you marry believing women and then divorce them before you have touched them read tamassūhunna or tumāsūhunna that is before you have copulated with them there shall be no waiting period for you to reckon against them no waiting period needed to preclude pregnancy or otherwise. But provide for them give them what they can use for securing comforts in cases where no dowry has been fixed for them; otherwise theirs is to retain half of what was fixed but no more — this is what Ibn ‘Abbās said and it is the opinion followed by al-Shāfi‘ī’; and release them in a gracious manner leave them be without the intention to cause them any harm.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّبِيُّ إِنَّآ أَحْلَلْنَا لَكَ أَزْوَاجَكَ ٱللاَّتِيۤ آتَيْتَ أُجُورَهُنَّ وَمَا مَلَكَتْ يَمِينُكَ مِمَّآ أَفَآءَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْكَ وَبَنَاتِ عَمِّكَ وَبَنَاتِ عَمَّاتِكَ وَبَنَاتِ خَالِكَ وَبَنَاتِ خَالاَتِكَ ٱللاَّتِي هَاجَرْنَ مَعَكَ وَٱمْرَأَةً مُّؤْمِنَةً إِن وَهَبَتْ نَفْسَهَا لِلنَّبِيِّ إِنْ أَرَادَ ٱلنَّبِيُّ أَن يَسْتَنكِحَهَا خَالِصَةً لَّكَ مِن دُونِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ قَدْ عَلِمْنَا مَا فَرَضْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ فِيۤ أَزْوَاجِهِـمْ وَمَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُهُمْ لِكَيْلاَ يَكُونَ عَلَيْكَ حَرَجٌ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ غَفُوراً رَّحِيماً,O Prophet! Indeed We have made lawful for you your wives whom you have given their dowries and what your right hand owns of those whom God has given you as spoils of war from the disbelievers whom you have taken captive such as Safiyya and Juwayriyya and the daughters of your paternal uncles and the daughters of your paternal aunts and the daughters of your maternal uncles and the daughters of your maternal aunts who emigrated with you as opposed to those who did not emigrate and any believing woman if she gift herself in marriage to the Prophet and if the Prophet desire to take her in marriage and ask for her hand in marriage without paying her a dowry — a privilege for you exclusively not for the rest of the believers nikāh ‘marriage’ when expressed by the term hiba ‘gift’ denotes marriage without dowry. Indeed We know what We have imposed upon them namely the believers with respect to their wives in the way of rulings to the effect that they should not take more than four wives and should only marry with the consent of a legal guardian the presence of witnesses and the payment of a dowry and with respect to what their right hands own of slavegirls in the way of purchase or otherwise so that the handmaiden be one lawful for her master such as a slavegirl belonging to the People of the Scripture kitābiyya and not a Magian or an idolater and that she should be ascertained as not carrying child with the necessary waiting period istibrā’ before copulation; so that li-kaylā is semantically connected to what came before this last statement there may be no unnecessary restriction for you no constraint in marriage for you. And God is Forgiving of what is difficult to guard against Merciful in giving dispensations allowing for latitude in this respect.
تُرْجِي مَن تَشَآءُ مِنْهُنَّ وَتُؤْوِيۤ إِلَيْكَ مَن تَشَآءُ وَمَنِ ٱبْتَغَيْتَ مِمَّنْ عَزَلْتَ فَلاَ جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكَ ذَلِكَ أَدْنَىٰ أَن تَقَرَّ أَعْيُنُهُنَّ وَلاَ يَحْزَنَّ وَيَرْضَيْنَ بِمَآ آتَيْتَهُنَّ كُلُّهُنَّ وَٱللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ مَا فِي قلُوبِكُمْ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ عَلِيماً حَلِيماً,You may put off read turji’ or turjī you may postpone consorting with whomever of them you wish namely of your wives from their turn for intimacy and consort embrace in conjugality whomever you wish of them and come unto her and as for whomever you may desire of those whom you have set aside from their share you would not be at fault to desire her and consort with her again. He was given the choice in this respect after it had been obligatory for him to give each wife her equal share of conjugality. That freedom of choice makes it likelier that they will be comforted and not grieve and that they will be satisfied with what you give them of what has been mentioned of your freedom to choose whom to consort with every one of them kulluhunna emphasises the subject of the verb yardayna ‘they will be satisfied’ will be well-pleased with what you give her. And God knows what is in your hearts with respect to your women and your preferring some to others. We have given you the freedom to choose from among them in order to make it easier for you to have what you desire. And God is Knower of His creatures Forbearing in refraining from punishing them.
لاَّ يَحِلُّ لَكَ ٱلنِّسَآءُ مِن بَعْدُ وَلاَ أَن تَبَدَّلَ بِهِنَّ مِنْ أَزْوَاجٍ وَلَوْ أَعْجَبَكَ حُسْنُهُنَّ إِلاَّ مَا مَلَكَتْ يَمِينُكَ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ رَّقِيباً,Women are not lawful for you read lā tahillu or lā yahillu beyond that beyond the nine that have chosen you as their husband nor is it lawful for you to change tabaddala one of the two original tā’ letters of tatabaddala has been omitted them for other wives by divorcing them or some of them and marry in place of those whom you divorce even though their beauty impress you except those whom your right hand owns of slavegirls which is in contrast lawful for you. In addition to these slavegirls the Prophet s came to own Māriya the Copt. She bore for him Ibrāhīm who died during his lifetime. And God is Watcher over Preserver of all things.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ لاَ تَدْخُلُواْ بُيُوتَ ٱلنَّبِيِّ إِلاَّ أَن يُؤْذَنَ لَكُمْ إِلَىٰ طَعَامٍ غَيْرَ نَاظِرِينَ إِنَاهُ وَلَـكِنْ إِذَا دُعِيتُمْ فَٱدْخُلُواْ فَإِذَا طَعِمْتُمْ فَٱنْتَشِرُواْ وَلاَ مُسْتَأْنِسِينَ لِحَدِيثٍ إِنَّ ذَٰلِكُمْ كَانَ يُؤْذِي ٱلنَّبِيَّ فَيَسْتَحْيِي مِنكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ لاَ يَسْتَحْيِي مِنَ ٱلْحَقِّ وَإِذَا سَأَلْتُمُوهُنَّ مَتَاعاً فَٱسْأَلُوهُنَّ مِن وَرَآءِ حِجَابٍ ذٰلِكُمْ أَطْهَرُ لِقُلُوبِكُمْ وَقُلُوبِهِنَّ وَمَا كَانَ لَكُمْ أَن تؤْذُواْ رَسُولَ ٱللَّهِ وَلاَ أَن تَنكِحُوۤاْ أَزْوَاجَهُ مِن بَعْدِهِ أَبَداً إِنَّ ذٰلِكُمْ كَانَ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ عَظِيماً,O you who believe do not enter the Prophet’s houses unless permission is granted you to enter by invitation to share a meal and so you enter without waiting for the right moment for when it is ready ināhu a verbal noun from anā ya’nī. But when you are invited enter and when you have had your meal disperse without lingering for any leisurely conversation amongst yourselves. Indeed that lingering is upsetting for the Prophet and he is too shy of you to make you leave but God is not shy of the truth that you should leave — in other words He would never refrain from declaring it a variant reading for yastahyī has yastahī. And when you ask anything of his womenfolk in other words the wives of the Prophet s ask them from behind a screen a curtain. That is purer for your hearts and their hearts than entertaining sinful thoughts. And you should never cause the Messenger of God hurt in any way; nor ever marry his wives after him. Assuredly that in God’s sight would be very grave as a sin.
إِن تُبْدُواْ شَيْئاً أَوْ تُخْفُوهُ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عَلِيماً,Whether you disclose anything or keep it hidden regarding marrying them after him truly God has knowledge of all things and will requite you for it.
لاَّ جُنَاحَ عَلَيْهِنَّ فِيۤ آبَآئِهِنَّ وَلاَ أَبْنَآئِهِنَّ وَلاَ إِخْوَانِهِنَّ وَلاَ أَبْنَآءِ إِخْوَانِهِنَّ وَلاَ أَبْنَآءِ أَخَوَاتِهِنَّ وَلاَ نِسَآئِهِنَّ وَلاَ مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُهُنَّ وَٱتَّقِينَ ٱللَّهَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ شَهِيداً,They the Prophet’s wives would not be at fault with regard to socialising with their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their brothers’ sons or their sisters’ sons or their own believing women or what their right hands own of slavegirls or male servants in seeing them or conversing with them without a screen. And fear O women God in what you have been commanded. Surely God is Witness to all things with nothing being hidden from Him.
إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ وَمَلاَئِكَـتَهُ يُصَلُّونَ عَلَى ٱلنَّبِيِّ يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ صَلُّواْ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلِّمُواْ تَسْلِيماً,Indeed God and His angels bless the Prophet Muhammad (s). O you who believe invoke blessings on him and invoke peace upon him in a worthy manner in other words say ‘O God bless our master Muhammad and grant him peace’ Allāhumma sallī ‘alā sayyidinā Muhammad wa-sallim.
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يُؤْذُونَ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ لَعَنَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ فِي ٱلدُّنْيَا وَٱلآخِرَةِ وَأَعَدَّ لَهُمْ عَذَاباً مُّهِيناً,Indeed those who are injurious to God and His Messenger — and they are the disbelievers who attribute to God what He is exalted above of such things as His having a son or a partner and they deny His Messenger — God has cursed them in this world and the Hereafter He has banished them from His mercy and has prepared for them a humiliating chastisement and that is the Fire.
وَٱلَّذِينَ يُؤْذُونَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَٱلْمُؤْمِنَاتِ بِغَيْرِ مَا ٱكْتَسَبُواْ فَقَدِ ٱحْتَمَلُواْ بُهْتَاناً وَإِثْماً مُّبِيناً,And those who cause hurt to believing men and believing women without the latter’s having done anything those who accuse them of what they have not done have verily borne the guilt of calumny they have borne lies and the burden of manifest sin.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّبِيُّ قُل لأَزْوَاجِكَ وَبَنَاتِكَ وَنِسَآءِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ يُدْنِينَ عَلَيْهِنَّ مِن جَلاَبِيبِهِنَّ ذٰلِكَ أَدْنَىٰ أَن يُعْرَفْنَ فَلاَ يُؤْذَيْنَ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ غَفُوراً رَّحِيماً,O Prophet! Tell your wives and daughters and the women of the believers to draw their cloaks closely over themselves jalābīb is the plural of jilbāb which is a wrap that covers a woman totally — in other words let them pull part of it also over their faces leaving one eye visible when they need to leave the house for something. That makes it likelier that they will be known to be free women and not be molested by being approached. In contrast slavegirls did not use to cover their faces and so the disbelievers used to pester them. And God is Forgiving of any occasion in the past when they may have neglected to cover themselves Merciful to them in His veiling them.
لَّئِن لَّمْ يَنتَهِ ٱلْمُنَافِقُونَ وَٱلَّذِينَ فِي قُلُوبِهِمْ مَّرَضٌ وَٱلْمُرْجِفُونَ فِي ٱلْمَدِينَةِ لَنُغْرِيَنَّكَ بِهِمْ ثُمَّ لاَ يُجَاوِرُونَكَ فِيهَآ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً,If la-in the lām is for oaths the hypocrites do not desist from their hypocrisy and likewise those in whose hearts is a sickness in their urge to fornicate as well as the scaremongers in the city who alarm the believers by saying to them things like ‘Your enemy is here and your raiding parties have been massacred!’ or they say to them ‘They have been defeated!’. Assuredly We will urge you to take action against them We will give you sway over them then they will not be your neighbours they will not dwell near you in it except for a little while after which they will depart.
مَّلْعُونِينَ أَيْنَمَا ثُقِفُوۤاْ أُخِذُواْ وَقُتِّلُواْ تَقْتِيلاً,Accursed banished from mercy shall they be wherever they are found they shall be seized and slain violently that is to say that is the ruling concerning them — meant as a command for the Prophet.
سُنَّةَ ٱللَّهِ فِي ٱلَّذِينَ خَلَوْاْ مِن قَبْلُ وَلَن تَجِدَ لِسُنَّةِ ٱللَّهِ تَبْدِيلاً,God’s precedent in other words God has made this His precedent in dealing with those who passed away before with regard to the hypocrites of past communities who used to alarm believers with their scaremongery and you will find that there is no changing God’s precedent no changing of it from Him.
يَسْأَلُكَ ٱلنَّاسُ عَنِ ٱلسَّاعَةِ قُلْ إِنَّمَا عِلْمُهَا عِندَ ٱللَّهِ وَمَا يُدْرِيكَ لَعَلَّ ٱلسَّاعَةَ تَكُونُ قَرِيباً,People such as the people of Mecca question you concerning the Hour when will it be? Say ‘Knowledge thereof lies only with God — and what do you know what would provide you with knowledge thereof? In other words you do not know it perhaps the Hour is near’.
إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَعَنَ ٱلْكَافِرِينَ وَأَعَدَّ لَهُمْ سَعِيراً,God has indeed cursed the disbelievers He has banished them from His mercy and prepared for them a blaze a violent fire into which they shall be admitted
خَالِدِينَ فِيهَآ أَبَداً لاَّ يَجِدُونَ وَلِيّاً وَلاَ نَصِيراً,to abide their abiding having been foreordained therein forever. They shall not find any protector to preserve them from it or helper to ward it off from them.
يَوْمَ تُقَلَّبُ وُجُوهُهُمْ فِي ٱلنَّارِ يَقُولُونَ يٰلَيْتَنَآ أَطَعْنَا ٱللَّهَ وَأَطَعْنَا ٱلرَّسُولاَ,On the day when their faces are turned about in the Fire they shall say ‘O yā is for alerting would that we had obeyed God and obeyed the Messenger!’
وَقَالُواْ رَبَّنَآ إِنَّآ أَطَعْنَا سَادَتَنَا وَكُبَرَآءَنَا فَأَضَلُّونَا ٱلسَّبِيلاْ,And they namely those who had been the followers of the leaders of error shall say ‘Our Lord we obeyed our leaders read plural sādatanā or sādātanā which is the plural of the plural and elders and they led us astray from the way the path of guidance.
رَبَّنَآ آتِهِمْ ضِعْفَيْنِ مِنَ ٱلْعَذَابِ وَٱلْعَنْهُمْ لَعْناً كَبِيراً,Our Lord give them a double chastisement in other words twice the like of our chastisement and curse them chastise them with numerous curses!’ with the equivalent number of chastisements la‘nan kathīran ‘numerous curses’ is also read la‘nan kabīran which means ‘with a mighty curse’.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ لاَ تَكُونُواْ كَٱلَّذِينَ آذَوْاْ مُوسَىٰ فَبرَّأَهُ ٱللَّهُ مِمَّا قَالُواْ وَكَانَ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ وَجِيهاً,O you who believe do not behave towards your Prophet as did those who harmed Moses — when they would say for example ‘The only reason he does not wash with us is that he has an inflammation in his testicles’ — whereat God absolved him of what they alleged when Moses placed his robe on a rock to go to wash the rock hurtled away with it until it came to a halt amid a group of men from the Children of Israel. As Moses chased it and took his robe to cover himself they saw that he had no such inflammation udra is an inflammation of the testicle. And he was distinguished in God’s sight. An instance of our Prophet s being subjected to hurt was when on one occasion while dividing up the spoils a man said to him ‘This is a division that I do not want to please God!’ whereat the Prophet s became angered and said ‘May God have mercy upon Moses for truly he was hurt with worse than this but endured’ — reported by al-Bukhārī.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ ٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَقُولُواْ قَوْلاً سَدِيداً,O you who believe fear God and speak words of integrity what is proper.
يُصْلِحْ لَكُمْ أَعْمَالَكُمْ وَيَغْفِرْ لَكُمْ ذُنُوبَكُمْ وَمَن يُطِعِ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ فَقَدْ فَازَ فَوْزاً عَظِيماً,He will rectify your deeds for you He will accept them and will forgive you your sins. And whoever obeys God and His Messenger has verily achieved a great success he has attained his ultimate goal.
إِنَّا عَرَضْنَا ٱلأَمَانَةَ عَلَى ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَٱلْجِبَالِ فَأبَيْنَ أَن يَحْمِلْنَهَا وَأَشْفَقْنَ مِنْهَا وَحَمَلَهَا ٱلإِنْسَانُ إِنَّهُ كَانَ ظَلُوماً جَهُولاً,Indeed We offered the Trust — the obligation to prayer and other matters which when performed result in reward and when neglected result in punishment — to the heavens and the earth and the mountains and created in them the power of comprehension and speech at the time of that offer but they refused to bear it and were apprehensive of it; but man Adam undertook it when it was offered to him. Truly he is a wrongdoer to his own soul because of what he undertook ignorant of the responsibility that comes with it —
لِّيُعَذِّبَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْمُنَافِقِينَ وَٱلْمُنَافِقَاتِ وَٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ وَٱلْمُشْرِكَاتِ وَيَتُوبَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَى ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَٱلْمُؤْمِنَاتِ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ غَفُوراً رَّحِيماً,so that God may chastise li-yu‘adhdhiba the lām therein is semantically connected to ‘aradnā ‘We offered’ which resulted in ‘Adam’s undertaking’ the hypocrites men and women and the idolaters men and women those who forsake the Trust and that God may relent to the believing men and believing women who fulfil the Trust. And God is Forgiving to believers Merciful to them.
ٱلْحَمْدُ للَّهِ ٱلَّذِي لَهُ مَا فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَلَهُ ٱلْحَمْدُ فِي ٱلآخِرَةِ وَهُوَ ٱلْحَكِيمُ ٱلْخَبِيرُ,Praise be to God — God exalted be He praises Himself with these words; the import constitutes the eulogy that ‘praise’ is ever-established for God and it entails the attribution to Him of all that is beautiful exalted be He — to Whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth as possessions and creation. And to Him belongs all praise in the Hereafter as in this world for His friends praise Him as they enter Paradise. And He is the Wise in what He does the Aware of His creatures.
يَعْلَمُ مَا يَلِجُ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَمَا يَخْرُجُ مِنْهَا وَمَا يَنزِلُ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ وَمَا يَعْرُجُ فِيهَا وَهُوَ ٱلرَّحِيمُ ٱلْغَفُورُ,He knows what penetrates the earth of water and so forth and what issues out of it of vegetation and so on and what comes down from the heaven of provision and so on and what ascends into it of deeds and so on and He is the Merciful to His friends the Forgiving to them.
وَقَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لاَ تَأْتِينَا ٱلسَّاعَةُ قُلْ بَلَىٰ وَرَبِّي لَتَأْتِيَنَّكُمْ عَالِمِ ٱلْغَيْبِ لاَ يَعْزُبُ عَنْهُ مِثْقَالُ ذَرَّةٍ فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَلاَ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَلاَ أَصْغَرُ مِن ذَلِكَ وَلاَ أَكْبَرُ إِلاَّ فِي كِتَابٍ مُّبِينٍ,And those who disbelieve say ‘The Hour the Resurrection will never come to us’. Say to them ‘Yes indeed by my Lord it shall come to you — by the Knower of the Unseen read ‘ālimi’l-ghaybi as an adjectival qualification of wa-rabbī ‘by my Lord’ or read ‘ālimu’l-ghaybi as the predicate of a missing subject such as huwa ‘He is’; or read ‘allāmi’l-ghaybi. Not even the weight of an atom escapes is hidden from Him in the heavens or in the earth nor is there anything smaller than that or greater but it is in a Manifest Book namely the Preserved Tablet al-lawh al-mahfūz
لِّيَجْزِيَ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ لَهُمْ مَّغْفِرَةٌ وَرِزْقٌ كَرِيمٌ,that He may requite thereat those who believe and perform righteous deeds — for such there will be forgiveness and a fair provision in Paradise.
وَٱلَّذِينَ سَعَوْا فِيۤ آيَاتِنَا مُعَاجِزِينَ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ مِّن رِّجْزٍ أَلِيمٌ,And those who strive against who strive to invalidate Our signs namely the Qur’ān deeming Us inomnipotent mu‘ajjizīna a variant reading of this here and later on in verse 38 below is mu‘ājizīna so that respectively these mean ‘deeming that We are incapable’ mu‘ajjizīna or if read mu‘ājizīna ‘vying with Us in order to elude Us’ for they suppose that there is no such thing as resurrection or punishment — for such there will be a chastisement of an awful punishment’ read either alīmin or alīmun respectively as an adjectival qualification of rijzin ‘punishment’ or ‘adhābun ‘chastisement’.
وَيَرَى ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ ٱلْعِلْمَ ٱلَّذِيۤ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ مِن رَّبِّكَ هُوَ ٱلْحَقَّ وَيَهْدِيۤ إِلَىٰ صِرَاطِ ٱلْعَزِيزِ ٱلْحَمِيدِ,And those who have been given knowledge — the believers from among the People of the Scripture such as ‘Abd Allāh b. Salām and his companions — see they know that what has been revealed to you from your Lord that is the Qur’ān is the decisive truth and that it guides to the path the way of the Mighty the Praised in other words of God the Lord of Might Who is ever-praised.
وَقَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ هَلْ نَدُلُّكُمْ عَلَىٰ رَجُلٍ يُنَبِّئُكُمْ إِذَا مُزِّقْتُمْ كُلَّ مُمَزَّقٍ إِنَّكُمْ لَفِي خَلْقٍ جَدِيدٍ,And those who disbelieve say that is some of them say to others in order to provoke disbelief in them ‘Shall we show you a man — namely Muhammad (s) — who will inform you that when you have been utterly torn to pieces you shall indeed be created anew?’
أَفْتَرَىٰ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ كَذِباً أَم بِهِ جِنَّةٌ بَلِ ٱلَّذِينَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱلآخِرَةِ فِي ٱلْعَذَابِ وَٱلضَّلاَلِ ٱلْبَعِيدِ,Has he invented read a’ftarā; the hamza read with a fatha vowelling is for the interrogative and suffices in place of the conjunctive hamza a lie against God in this respect or is there a madness in him does he suffer a dementia on account of which he has imagined that? God exalted be He says Nay but those who do not believe in the Hereafter that comprises resurrection and chastisement will be in the chastisement thereat and in error that is far from the truth in this world.
أَفَلَمْ يَرَوْاْ إِلَىٰ مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ وَٱلأَرْضِ إِن نَّشَأْ نَخْسِفْ بِهِمُ ٱلأَرْضَ أَوْ نُسْقِطْ عَلَيْهِمْ كِسَفاً مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ إِنَّ فِي ذَلِكَ لآيَةً لِّكُلِّ عَبْدٍ مُّنِيبٍ,Have they not observed what is before them and what is behind them in other words what is above them and what is beneath them of heaven and earth? If We will it We can make the earth swallow them or let fall on them fragments read kisfan or kisafan ‘large pieces’ from the heaven a variant reading has the third person singular for all three verbs sc. yashā’ ‘He will’ yakhsif ‘He makes to swallow’ yusqit ‘He lets fall’. Surely in that which is observed there is a sign for every penitent servant turning back to his Lord signs indicating God’s power to resurrect and to do what He will.
وَلَقَدْ آتَيْنَا دَاوُودَ مِنَّا فَضْلاً يٰجِبَالُ أَوِّبِي مَعَهُ وَٱلطَّيْرَ وَأَلَنَّا لَهُ ٱلْحَدِيدَ,And verily We bestowed on David a great favour from Us — prophethood and scripture — and We said ‘O mountains repeat with him in praise by making glorifications and the birds too!’ read wa’l-tayra in the accusative as a supplement to the syntactical locus of jibāl ‘mountains’ in other words and We also called on them to glorify God with him. And We made iron malleable for him so that it was as dough in his hands.
أَنِ ٱعْمَلْ سَابِغَاتٍ وَقَدِّرْ فِي ٱلسَّرْدِ وَٱعْمَلُواْ صَالِحاً إِنِّي بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ,And We said ‘Fashion from it long coats of mail — complete suits of armour which the person wearing it drags behind him along the ground — and measure well the links’ that is in the weaving of the coats the maker of these is called sarrād. In other words make them so that the rings thereof are arranged properly. And act O family of David together with him righteously. Indeed I am Seer of what you do and will requite you for it accordingly.
وَلِسُلَيْمَانَ ٱلرِّيحَ غُدُوُّهَا شَهْرٌ وَرَوَاحُهَا شَهْرٌ وَأَسَلْنَا لَهُ عَيْنَ ٱلْقِطْرِ وَمِنَ ٱلْجِنِّ مَن يَعْمَلُ بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ بِإِذْنِ رَبِّهِ وَمَن يَزِغْ مِنْهُمْ عَنْ أَمْرِنَا نُذِقْهُ مِنْ عَذَابِ ٱلسَّعِيرِ,And We disposed for Solomon the wind the nominative reading of al-rīhu would be based on an implicit missing verb sakhkharnā ‘We disposed’ its morning course meaning its journey from the morning to the noon was a month’s journey and its evening course that is its journey from the noon to sunset was a month’s journey. And We caused a fount of molten copper to flow for him in other words We caused the copper to melt for him and so the fount flowed for three days and nights like water and to this day people have been using of that copper which was given to Solomon at that time. And of the jinn there were those who worked before him by the leave by the command of his Lord. And such of them as deviated from Our command to him to obey him Solomon We would make them taste the chastisement of the Blaze the Fire in the Hereafter — but it is also said that their chastisement was in this world in which case an angel would smite one of them with a lash thereof that would scorch him.
يَعْمَلُونَ لَهُ مَا يَشَآءُ مِن مَّحَارِيبَ وَتَمَاثِيلَ وَجِفَانٍ كَٱلْجَوَابِ وَقُدُورٍ رَّاسِيَاتٍ ٱعْمَلُوۤاْ آلَ دَاوُودَ شُكْراً وَقَلِيلٌ مِّنْ عِبَادِيَ ٱلشَّكُورُ,They fashioned for him whatever he wished lofty shrines mahārīb are high edifices which are ascended by stairs and statues tamāthīl is the plural of timthāl which is any thing which you fashion as a likeness of another in other words brass crystal or marble figures — the use of figures was not prohibited according to his Law; and basins jifān is the plural of jafna like cisterns jawābin is the plural of jābiya which is a large basin — around each ‘basin’ a thousand men would gather to eat — and cauldrons built into the ground fixed with foundations and cannot be moved from their places these were made from the rocks of the mountains of Yemen and to which one ascended by climbing up a ladder. And We said ‘Work O House of David in obedience to God in thankfulness to Him for what He has given you. And few indeed of My servants are thankful’ labouring in obedience to Me in thanks for My favours.
فَلَمَّا قَضَيْنَا عَلَيْهِ ٱلْمَوْتَ مَا دَلَّهُمْ عَلَىٰ مَوْتِهِ إِلاَّ دَابَّةُ الأَرْضِ تَأْكُلُ مِنسَأَتَهُ فَلَمَّا خَرَّ تَبَيَّنَتِ ٱلْجِنُّ أَن لَّوْ كَانُواْ يَعْلَمُونَ ٱلْغَيْبَ مَا لَبِثُواْ فِي ٱلْعَذَابِ ٱلْمُهِينِ,And when We decreed for him for Solomon death in other words when he died — he remained supported against his staff an entire year while the jinn continued to toil in hard labour as was customary unaware of his death until finally when a termite ate through his staff he fell to the ground and was seen to be dead — nothing indicated to them that he had died except a termite al-ard is the verbal noun from uridat al-khashaba passive verbal form in other words ‘it the piece of wood was eaten away by a termite al-arada’ that gnawed away at his staff read minsa’atahu or minsātahu replacing the hamza with an alif meaning a ‘staff’ so called because when describing it one would say yunsa’u bihā to mean it is used to repel or drive away creatures’. And when he fell down dead the jinn realised it became apparent to them that an is softened in other words annahum had they known the Unseen — comprising what was hidden from them in the way of Solomon being dead — they would not have continued in the humiliating chastisement in that hard labour of theirs in which they continued as they supposed him to be alive which is in contrast to what they would have supposed had they known the Unseen and the fact that he had been there an entire year judging by how much of the staff the termite had eaten through after his death; in other words they would not have continued in the humiliating chastisement for a single day or even a single night longer.
لَقَدْ كَانَ لِسَبَإٍ فِي مَسْكَنِهِمْ آيَةٌ جَنَّتَانِ عَن يَمِينٍ وَشِمَالٍ كُلُواْ مِن رِّزْقِ رَبِّكُمْ وَٱشْكُرُواْ لَهُ بَلْدَةٌ طَيِّبَةٌ وَرَبٌّ غَفُورٌ,Verily there was for Sheba Saba’ declined as li-Saba’in or left as indeclinable li-Saba’a is the name of a tribe that took its name from one of their Arab ancestors in their dwelling-place in Yemen a sign indicating God’s power exalted be He two gardens jannatān a substitution for āyatun ‘a sign’ to the right and to the left in other words on the right side of their valley and on its left side. And it was said to them ‘Eat of your Lord’s provision and give thanks to Him for the graces He has bestowed on you in the land of Sheba. A good land — in which there was no dung gnats flies fleas scorpions or snakes and in which when a stranger passed through with his clothes lice-infected these lice would be killed off because of the purity of its air — and God is a forgiving Lord.’
فَأَعْرَضُواْ فَأَرْسَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ سَيْلَ ٱلْعَرِمِ وَبَدَّلْنَاهُمْ بِجَنَّتَيْهِمْ جَنَّتَيْنِ ذَوَاتَيْ أُكُلٍ خَمْطٍ وَأَثْلٍ وَشَيْءٍ مِّن سِدْرٍ قَلِيلٍ,But they were disregardful of giving thanks to Him and became disbelievers so We unleashed upon them the flood of the Dam al-‘arim is the plural of ‘arima which is a structure or something similar that holds water back to be stored for when it is needed in other words We unleashed upon them the flood-waters of their valley which had been held back by the mentioned structure so that they engulfed their two gardens together with all their property. And We gave them in place of their two gardens two gardens bearing dhawātay a dual form of feminine plural dhawāt; usually the form dhātay from the singular would have been used bitter fruit bitter and vile ukul may be read as a genitive annexation ukulin khamtin in the sense of ‘that which is eaten thereof being bitter; or it may be read without as ukuli khamtin; and this phrase is supplemented by the following wa-athlin wa-shay’in min sidrin qalīl and tamarisk and sparse lote trees.
ذَٰلِكَ جَزَيْنَاهُمْ بِمَا كَفَرُواْ وَهَلْ نُجَٰزِيۤ إِلاَّ ٱلْكَفُورَ,That replacement of what they had is what We requited them with for their ingratitude and is anyone but the ingrate ever so requited? read hal yujāzā illā’l-kafūru; or read as hal nujāzī illā’l-kafūra ‘Would We requite anyone but the ingrate?’ in other words it is only the like of such who is called to account.
وَجَعَلْنَا بَيْنَهُمْ وَبَيْنَ ٱلْقُرَى ٱلَّتِي بَارَكْنَا فِيهَا قُرًى ظَاهِرَةً وَقَدَّرْنَا فِيهَا ٱلسَّيْرَ سِيرُواْ فِيهَا لَيَالِيَ وَأَيَّاماً آمِنِينَ,And We set between them between Sheba who were in Yemen and the towns which We had blessed with abundance of water and trees — these being the towns of Syria to which they used to travel for commerce — prominent towns continuous along the route from Yemen to Syria and We facilitated for travellers the journeying through them such that they would rest for the afternoon in one and spend the night in the next and so on until the end of their travel having no need of any supplies or water along the way; and We said ‘Travel through them night and day safely’ having no fear by night or by day.
فَقَالُواْ رَبَّنَا بَاعِدْ بَيْنَ أَسْفَارِنَا وَظَلَمُوۤاْ أَنفُسَهُمْ فَجَعَلْنَاهُمْ أَحَادِيثَ وَمَزَّقْنَاهُمْ كُلَّ مُمَزَّقٍ إِنَّ فِي ذَلِكَ لآيَاتٍ لِّكُلِّ صَبَّارٍ شَكُورٍ,But they said ‘Our Lord make far apart ba‘‘id a variant reading has bā‘id the stages of our travel’ to Syria make these stages through deserts so that they could glory before the poor in riding their camels and bearing their supplies and water and so they behaved wantonly with the graces bestowed on them by God and they wronged their souls through disbelief and so We made them bywords of wrongdoing in this respect for those who came after them and We caused them to disintegrate totally We scattered them all over the lands. Surely in that which is mentioned there are signs lessons for every servant who is steadfast in refraining from acts of disobedience grateful for God’s graces.
وَلَقَدْ صَدَّقَ عَلَيْهِمْ إِبْلِيسُ ظَنَّهُ فَٱتَّبَعُوهُ إِلاَّ فَرِيقاً مِّنَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,And verily Iblīs proved true read sadaqa or saddaqa his opinion of them that is of the disbelievers among them — the folk of Sheba — which was that by his tempting them to go astray they would follow him. So they followed him if the verb above is read sadaqa this would mean that ‘he was right in his opinion’ and if read saddaqa it would mean that ‘he found this opinion of his to be true’ — all except a group of the believers mina’l-mu’minīna the min ‘of’ is explicative not partitive in other words all except that group who were the believers they did not follow him.
وَمَا كَانَ لَهُ عَلَيْهِمْ مِّن سُلْطَانٍ إِلاَّ لِنَعْلَمَ مَن يُؤْمِنُ بِٱلآخِرَةِ مِمَّنْ هُوَ مِنْهَا فِي شَكٍّ وَرَبُّكَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ حَفُيظٌ,And he did not have any warrant over them any power to sway them from Us but that We might know by this knowledge being made manifest him who believed in the Hereafter from him who was in doubt thereof and so requite each of the two accordingly. And your Lord is Preserver Watcher of all things.
قُلِ ٱدْعُواْ ٱلَّذِينَ زَعَمْتُمْ مِّن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ لاَ يَمْلِكُونَ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَلاَ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَمَا لَهُمْ فِيهِمَا مِن شِرْكٍ وَمَا لَهُ مِنْهُمْ مِّن ظَهِيرٍ,Say O Muhammad (s) to the disbelievers of Mecca ‘Call on those whom you have asserted those whom you have asserted to be gods besides God in other words other than Him so that they might benefit you as you are wont to assert. God exalted be He says of them They do not possess even so much as the weight of an atom of good or evil in the heavens or in the earth and they do not have any share in either of them nor has He exalted be He among them the gods any auxiliary’ anyone required as His helper.
وَلاَ تَنفَعُ ٱلشَّفَاعَةُ عِندَهُ إِلاَّ لِمَنْ أَذِنَ لَهُ حَتَّىٰ إِذَا فُزِّعَ عَن قُلُوبِهِمْ قَالُواْ مَاذَا قَالَ رَبُّكُمْ قَالُواْ ٱلْحَقَّ وَهُوَ ٱلْعَلِيُّ ٱلْكَبِيرُ,And intercession will not avail with Him exalted be He — this was in response to their saying that their gods would intercede for them with Him — except for him to whom leave is given in this respect read adhina ‘to whom He gives leave’; or udhina ‘to whom leave is given’. Yet when fear is banished from their hearts read active fazza‘a or passive fuzzi‘a when fear is removed from them upon leave being given for this intercession they will say — some will say to others in anticipation of a favourable outcome — ‘What has your Lord said?’ concerning this. They will say He has said the saying that is ‘The truth’ in other words leave has been given for it. And He is the Exalted above His creation by His subjugation of them the Great the Tremendous.
قُلْ مَن يَرْزُقُكُمْ مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ قُلِ ٱللَّهُ وَإِنَّآ أَوْ إِيَّاكُمْ لَعَلَىٰ هُدًى أَوْ فِي ضَلاَلٍ مُّبِينٍ,Say ‘Who provides for you from the heavens rain and from the earth?’ vegetation. Say ‘God!’ — even if they do not say it there is no other valid answer. And indeed either we or you are — in other words either one of the two parties is — rightly guided or in manifest error. The ambiguity here concerning which of the two is rightly guided is intended as a gentle invitation for them to embrace faith if their way to it is facilitated by God.
قُل لاَّ تُسْأَلُونَ عَمَّآ أَجْرَمْنَا وَلاَ نُسْأَلُ عَمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ,Say ‘You will not be questioned about the sins we committed nor shall we be questioned about what you do’ for we are quit of you.
قُلْ يَجْمَعُ بَيْنَنَا رَبُّنَا ثُمَّ يَفْتَحُ بَيْنَنَا بِٱلْحَقِّ وَهُوَ ٱلْفَتَّاحُ ٱلْعَلِيمُ,Say ‘Our Lord will bring us together on the Day of Resurrection then He will judge between us with truth and He will admit the truthful into Paradise and the liars into the Fire. And He is the Judge the Knowing’ in what He judges.
قُلْ أَرُونِيَ ٱلَّذيِنَ أَلْحَقْتُمْ بِهِ شُرَكَآءَ كَلاَّ بَلْ هُوَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْحْكِيمُ,Say ‘Show me apprise me of those whom you have joined to Him as associates in worship. No indeed! — this is meant to deter them from even supposing that He has an associate. Rather He is God the Mighty Whose way will prevail the Wise’ in the way in which He manages the affairs of His creation and so He could not have any associate in His kingdom.
وَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَاكَ إِلاَّ كَآفَّةً لِّلنَّاسِ بَشِيراً وَنَذِيراً وَلَـٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ ٱلنَّاسِ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ,And We did not send you except to all kāffatan is a circumstantial qualifier referring to al-nās ‘mankind’ and is made to precede li’l-nās because of the importance attached to it of mankind both as a bearer of good tidings to believers of Paradise and a warner to the disbelievers of chastisement but most people such as the disbelievers of Mecca do not know this.
وَيَقُولُونَ مَتَىٰ هَـٰذَا ٱلْوَعْدُ إِن كُنتُمْ صَادِقِينَ,And they say ‘When shall this promise of chastisement be fulfilled if you are being truthful?’ concerning it.
قُل لَّكُم مِّيعَادُ يَوْمٍ لاَّ تَسْتَأْخِرُونَ عَنْهُ سَاعَةً وَلاَ تَسْتَقْدِمُونَ,Say ‘Yours is the tryst of a Day which you can neither defer nor advance by a single hour’ and this is the Day of Resurrection.
وَقَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لَن نُّؤْمِنَ بِهَـٰذَا ٱلْقُرْآنِ وَلاَ بِٱلَّذِي بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ وَلَوْ تَرَىٰ إِذِ ٱلظَّالِمُونَ مَوْقُوفُونَ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ يَرْجِعُ بَعْضُهُمْ إِلَىٰ بَعْضٍ ٱلْقَوْلَ يَقُولُ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱسْتُضْعِفُواْ لِلَّذِينَ ٱسْتَكْبَرُواْ لَوْلاَ أَنتُمْ لَكُنَّا مُؤْمِنِينَ,And those who disbelieve from among the people of Mecca say ‘We will not believe in this Qur’ān nor in that which was revealed before it’ — in other words what preceded it such as the Torah and the Gospel both of which contain proofs of the Resurrection — because they reject the truth of this last. God exalted be He says of them But if you were to see O Muhammad (s) when the evildoers the disbelievers are brought to stand before their Lord bandying arguments against one another. Those who were oppressed — the followers — will say to those who were arrogant — the leaders ‘Had it not been for you barring us from faith we would have been believers’ in the Prophet.
قَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱسْتَكْبَرُواْ لِلَّذِينَ ٱسْتُضْعِفُوۤاْ أَنَحْنُ صَدَدنَاكُمْ عَنِ ٱلْهُدَىٰ بَعْدَ إِذْ جَآءَكُمْ بَلْ كُنتُمْ مُّجْرِمِينَ,Those who were arrogant will say to those who were oppressed ‘Was it us who barred you from guidance after it had come to you? Nay! Rather you were guilty’ of your own accord.
وَقَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱسْتُضْعِفُواْ لِلَّذِينَ ٱسْتَكْبَرُواْ بَلْ مَكْرُ ٱلَّيلِ وَٱلنَّهَارِ إِذْ تَأْمُرُونَنَآ أَن نَّكْفُرَ بِٱللَّهِ وَنَجْعَلَ لَهُ أَندَاداً وَأَسَرُّواْ ٱلنَّدَامَةَ لَمَّا رَأَوُاْ ٱلْعَذَابَ وَجَعَلْنَا ٱلأَغْلاَلَ فِيۤ أَعْنَاقِ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ هَلْ يُجْزَوْنَ إِلاَّ مَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ,And those who were oppressed will say to those who were arrogant ‘Nay but it was your scheming night and day in other words such were your schemes against us during both of these times when you used to command us to disbelieve in God and set up partners with Him’. And they that is the two parties will conceal their remorse for not having believed in Him when they see the chastisement in other words each person will hide it his remorse from the next for fear of being reviled; and We will place fetters around the necks of the disbelievers while they are in the Fire. Shall they be requited except the requital for what they used to do? in the world.
وَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَا فِي قَرْيَةٍ مِّن نَّذِيرٍ إِلاَّ قَالَ مُتْرَفُوهَآ إِنَّا بِمَآ أُرْسِلْتُمْ بِهِ كَافِرُونَ,And We did not send a warner to any town without its affluent ones its leaders those enjoying life’s comforts saying ‘Indeed we disbelieve in that Message with which you have been sent’.
وَقَالُواْ نَحْنُ أَكْثَـرُ أَمْوَالاً وَأَوْلاَداً وَمَا نَحْنُ بِمُعَذَّبِينَ,And they say ‘We possess more wealth and children than those who are believers and we shall not be chastised’.
قُلْ إِنَّ رَبِّي يَبْسُطُ ٱلرِّزْقَ لِمَن يَشَآءُ وَيَقْدِرُ وَلَـٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ ٱلنَّاسِ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ,Say ‘Truly my Lord extends provision He makes it abundant for whomever He will as a test and restricts it for whomever He will to try them but most people such as the disbelievers of Mecca do not know’ this truth.
وَمَآ أَمْوَالُكُمْ وَلاَ أَوْلاَدُكُمْ بِٱلَّتِي تُقَرِّبُكُمْ عِندَنَا زُلْفَىٰ إِلاَّ مَنْ آمَنَ وَعَمِلَ صَالِحاً فَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ لَهُمْ جَزَآءُ ٱلضِّعْفِ بِمَا عَمِلُواْ وَهُمْ فِي ٱلْغُرُفَاتِ آمِنُونَ,Nor is it your wealth or your children that will bring you near to Us in closeness except for but it is those who believe and act righteously those they shall have a twofold reward for what they did in other words they shall have it as the reward of their action — as a good deed for example is rewarded tenfold or more — and they shall be in the lofty abodes of Paradise secure from death and otherwise a variant reading for al-ghurufāt is al-ghurfa the generic noun implying a plural.
وَٱلَّذِينَ يَسْعَوْنَ فِيۤ آيَاتِنَا مُعَاجِزِينَ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ فِي ٱلْعَذَابِ مُحْضَرُونَ,And those who strive against Our signs namely the Qur’ān seeking to invalidate it supposing Us to be inomnipotent — or supposing that they can elude Us — those they will be arraigned into the chastisement.
قُلْ إِنَّ رَبِّي يَبْسُطُ ٱلرِّزْقَ لِمَن يَشَآءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ وَيَقْدِرُ لَهُ وَمَآ أَنفَقْتُمْ مِّن شَيْءٍ فَهُوَ يُخْلِفُهُ وَهُوَ خَيْرُ ٱلرَّازِقِينَ,Say ‘My Lord extends provision He makes it abundant for whomever He will of His servants as a test and restricts it for him after having extended it — or He restricts it for him whom He will to try and whatever thing you may expend for the cause of good He will replace it. And He is the best of providers’. It is said that every man ‘provides for’ his dependants yarzuqu ‘ā’ilatahu meaning that he does so from the provision given to him by God.
وَيَوْمَ يَحْشُرُهُمْ جَمِيعاً ثُمَّ يَقُولُ لِلْمَلاَئِكَةِ أَهَـٰؤُلاَءِ إِيَّاكُمْ كَانُواْ يَعْبُدُونَ,And mention on the Day when He will gather them all together namely all the idolaters He will say to the angels ‘Was it these who used to worship you?’ read a-hā’ūlā’i iyyākum pronouncing both hamzas or by replacing the first with a yā’ or dropping it altogether.
قَالُواْ سُبْحَانَكَ أَنتَ وَلِيُّنَا مِن دُونِهِمْ بَلْ كَانُواْ يَعْبُدُونَ ٱلْجِنَّ أَكْـثَرُهُم بِهِم مُّؤْمِنُونَ,They will say ‘Glory be to You exalted above that You should have an associate! You are our Supporter not they in other words as far as we are concerned there are no bonds of association between us and them. Nay bal is to indicate transition rather they used to worship the jinn the devils in other words they used to obey them and agree to worship us; most of them were believers in them’ accepting as truth what these jinn used to say to them.
فَٱلْيَوْمَ لاَ يَمْلِكُ بَعْضُكُمْ لِبَعْضٍ نَّفْعاً وَلاَ ضَرّاً وَنَقُولُ لِلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ ذُوقُواْ عَذَابَ ٱلنَّارِ ٱلَّتِي كُنتُم بِهَا تُكَذِّبُونَ,God exalted be He says ‘So today none among you has any power over another in other words none of those worshipped have any power over any of those who worshipped either to benefit through intercession or to hurt’ through chastisement. And We shall say to those who did wrong who disbelieved ‘Taste the chastisement of the Fire which you used to deny!’
وَإِذَا تُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْهِمْ آيَاتُنَا بَيِّنَاتٍ قَالُواْ مَا هَـٰذَا إِلاَّ رَجُلٌ يُرِيدُ أَن يَصُدَّكُمْ عَمَّا كَانَ يَعْبُدُ آبَآؤُكُمْ وَقَالُواْ مَا هَـٰذَآ إِلاَّ إِفْكٌ مُّفْتَرًى وَقَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لِلْحَقِّ لَمَّا جَآءَهُمْ إِنْ هَـٰذَآ إِلاَّ سِحْرٌ مُّبِينٌ,And when Our signs from the Qur’ān are recited to them being clear signs evident ones by the tongue of our Prophet Muhammad (s) they say ‘This is just a man who desires to bar you from worshipping what your fathers used to worship’ of idols. And they say ‘This Qur’ān is nothing but a calumny a lie that has been invented against God. And those who disbelieve say to the truth the Qur’ān when it comes to them ‘This is nothing but plain sorcery’. God exalted be He says
وَمَآ آتَيْنَاهُمْ مِّنْ كُتُبٍ يَدْرُسُونَهَا وَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَا إِلَيْهِمْ قَبْلَكَ مِّن نَّذِيرٍ,And We did not give them any scriptures for them to study nor did We send them any warner before you so on what grounds do they deny you?
وَكَذَّبَ الَّذِينَ مِن قَبلِهِمْ وَمَا بَلَغُواْ مِعْشَارَ مَآ ءَاتَيْنَاهُمْ فَكَذَّبُواْ رُسُلِي فَكَيْفَ كَانَ نَكِيرِ,And those who were before them also denied and they these ones the Meccans have not received even a tenth of what We gave those others in the way of might long life and abundance of wealth. Yet they denied My messengers who were sent to them so how was My abhorrence! so how was My rebuttal against them through punishment and destruction in other words it was appropriate.
قُلْ إِنَّمَآ أَعِظُكُمْ بِوَاحِدَةٍ أَن تَقُومُواْ لِلَّهِ مَثْنَىٰ وَفُرَادَىٰ ثُمَّ تَتَفَكَّرُواْ مَا بِصَاحِبِكُمْ مِّن جِنَّةٍ إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ نَذِيرٌ لَّكُمْ بَيْنَ يَدَيْ عَذَابٍ شَدِيدٍ,Say ‘I will give you just one piece of admonition namely that you rise up for God in other words for His sake in twos and individually and then reflect and realise that there is no madness in your companion Muhammad (s). He is just a warner to you before the befalling of a severe chastisement’ in the Hereafter if you disobey him.
قُلْ مَا سَأَلْتُكُم مِّن أَجْرٍ فَهُوَ لَكُمْ إِنْ أَجْرِيَ إِلاَّ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ وَهُوَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ شَهِيدٌ,Say to them ‘I have not asked you in return for my warning and delivering the Message to you any reward since it is for the benefit of you in other words I do not ask you for any reward in return for this. Indeed my reward lies only with God and He is Witness over all things’ observing them all knowing my truthfulness.
قُلْ إِنَّ رَبِّي يَقْذِفُ بِٱلْحَقِّ عَلاَّمُ ٱلْغُيُوبِ,Say ‘Indeed my Lord hurls the truth He casts it onto His prophets — He is the Knower of the Unseen’ of all that is hidden from His creatures throughout the heavens and the earth.
قُلْ جَآءَ ٱلْحَقُّ وَمَا يُبْدِىءُ ٱلْبَاطِلُ وَمَا يُعِيدُ,Say ‘The truth Islam has come. And falsehood disbelief neither originates nor restores anything’ in other words it leaves no trace of itself behind.
قُلْ إِن ضَلَلْتُ فَإِنَّمَآ أَضِلُّ عَلَىٰ نَفْسِي وَإِنِ ٱهْتَدَيْتُ فَبِمَا يُوحِي إِلَيَّ رَبِّي إِنَّهُ سَمِيعٌ قَرِيبٌ,Say ‘If I go astray from the truth I will be going astray only to my own loss that is to say the sin of my going astray shall be held against me; and if I am rightly guided it will have been by what my Lord reveals to me of the Qur’ān and wisdom. Truly He is Hearer of supplications Nigh’.
وَلَوْ تَرَىٰ إِذْ فَزِعُواْ فَلاَ فَوْتَ وَأُخِذُواْ مِن مَّكَانٍ قَرِيبٍ,If you could but see O Muhammad (s) when they are stricken with terror at the Resurrection you would see a dreadful thing and so there is no escape for them from Us that is to say they will not be able to elude Us and they are seized from a close quarter namely from the graves.
وَقَالُوۤاْ آمَنَّا بِهِ وَأَنَّىٰ لَهُمُ ٱلتَّنَاوُشُ مِن مَّكَانٍ بَعِيدٍ,And they will say ‘We believe in him now’ in other words in Muhammad (s) — or if read ‘We believe in it’ then in the Qur’ān. But how can they attain it read tanāwush or tanā’ush that is attain faith from a place that is far away from the place for attaining it — as they are now in the Hereafter and the proper place for attaining it was in this world —
وَقَدْ كَـفَرُواْ بِهِ مِن قَـبْلُ وَيَقْذِفُونَ بِٱلْغَيْبِ مِن مَّكَانٍ بَعِيدٍ,when they disbelieved in it before? in this world. And they throw guesses at the Unseen from a far-off place in other words they make guesses about something the knowledge of which was hidden far away from them as when they would say that the Prophet was a sorcerer or a poet or a soothsayer or that the Qur’ān was sorcery poetry or soothsaying.
وَحِيلَ بَيْنَهُمْ وَبَيْنَ مَا يَشْتَهُونَ كَمَا فُعِلَ بِأَشْيَاعِهِم مِّن قَبْلُ إِنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ فِي شَكٍّ مُّرِيبٍ,And a barrier is set between them and what they crave in the way of faith — in other words their craving to embrace it — just as was done with their counterparts in respect to disbelief formerly in other words before them. Indeed they used to be in grave doubt doubt causing them to have misgivings about that in which they now believe but the proofs for which they never considered in this world.
ٱلْحَمْدُ للَّهِ فَاطِرِ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ جَاعِلِ ٱلْمَلاَئِكَةِ رُسُلاً أُوْلِيۤ أَجْنِحَةٍ مَّثْنَىٰ وَثُلاَثَ وَرُبَاعَ يَزِيدُ فِي ٱلْخَلْقِ مَا يَشَآءُ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,Praise be to God God praises Himself with in these terms as explained at the beginning of the preceding sūrat Saba’ Originator of the heavens and the earth the One Who created them without any precedent Appointer of the angels as messengers to His prophets having wings in sets of two or three or four. He multiplies in creation in angels and other creatures what He will. Surely God has power over all things.
مَّا يَفْتَحِ ٱللَّهُ لِلنَّاسِ مِن رَّحْمَةٍ فَلاَ مُمْسِكَ لَهَا وَمَا يُمْسِكْ فَلاَ مُرْسِلَ لَهُ مِن بَعْدِهِ وَهُوَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ,Whatever mercy God unfolds for mankind in the way of provision or rain none can withhold it; and whatever He withholds thereof none can release it after Him that is after His withholding it. And He is the Mighty Whose way prevails the Wise in what He does.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّاسُ ٱذْكُرُواْ نِعْمَتَ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ هَلْ مِنْ خَالِقٍ غَيْرُ ٱللَّهِ يَرْزُقُكُمْ مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ وَٱلأَرْضِ لاَ إِلَـٰهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ فَأَنَّىٰ تُؤْفَكُونَ,O people that is the people of Mecca remember God’s grace to you in His making you dwell within the Meccan Sanctuary and preventing raids against you. Is there any creator min khāliqin min is extra; khāliq is the subject other than God read ghayru’Llāhi or gharyri’Llāhi as an adjectival qualification of khāliq ‘creator’ either concording with the oblique form of min khāliqin or concording with the syntactical status thereof; the predicate of the subject is the following who provides for you from the heaven rain and from the earth? vegetation the interrogative is actually an affirmative that is to say ‘there is no creator or provider other than Him. There is no god except Him. So how then do you deviate? how are you turned away from affirming His Oneness when you already affirm that He is the Creator and the Provider?
وَإِن يُكَذِّبُوكَ فَقَدْ كُذِّبَتْ رُسُلٌ مِّن قَبْلِكَ وَإِلَى ٱللَّهِ تُرْجَعُ ٱلأُمُورُ,And if they deny you O Muhammad (s) with regard to your coming with the message of God’s Oneness resurrection reckoning and punishment verily other messengers before you were denied in this respect so be steadfast as they were steadfast; and to God all matters are returned in the Hereafter when He will requite the deniers and grant victory to the messengers.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّاسُ إِنَّ وَعْدَ ٱللَّهِ حَقٌّ فَلاَ تَغُرَّنَّكُمُ ٱلْحَيَاةُ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَلاَ يَغُرَّنَّكُمْ بِٱللَّهِ ٱلْغَرُورُ,O mankind! Indeed God’s promise of resurrection and of other issues is true. So do not let the life of this world deceive you from believing in all of that and do not let the Deceiver Satan deceive you concerning God on account of His forbearance and respiting of sinners in this life.
إِنَّ ٱلشَّيْطَانَ لَكُمْ عَدُوٌّ فَٱتَّخِذُوهُ عَدُوّاً إِنَّمَا يَدْعُواْ حِزْبَهُ لِيَكُونُواْ مِنْ أَصْحَابِ ٱلسَّعِيرِ,Truly Satan is an enemy to you. So treat him as an enemy by being obedient to God and do not obey him; he only summons his faction his followers in disbelief so that they may be among the inhabitants of the Blaze the fierce Fire.
ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ شَدِيدٌ وَٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ لَهُم مَّغْفِرَةٌ وَأَجْرٌ كَبِيرٌ,Those who disbelieve theirs will be a severe chastisement; but those who believe and perform righteous deeds theirs will be forgiveness and a great reward — this is a declaration of what fate will be for the adherents of Satan and what will be for his opponents respectively.
أَفَمَن زُيِّنَ لَهُ سُوۤءُ عَمَلِهِ فَرَآهُ حَسَناً فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُضِلُّ مَن يَشَآءُ وَيَهْدِي مَن يَشَآءُ فَلاَ تَذْهَبْ نَفْسُكَ عَلَيْهِمْ حَسَرَاتٍ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلِيمٌ بِمَا يَصْنَعُونَ,The following was revealed regarding Abū Jahl and others Is he the evil of whose deeds is made to seem fair to him by distortion so that he deems it good …? a-fa-man ‘is he whose’ constitutes the subject the predicate of which is an omitted ‘like one whom God has guided?’ No! And this predicate is indicated by what follows. Indeed God leads astray whomever He will and guides whomever He will. So do not let your soul expire for their sake for those to whom it has made to seem fair out of sighings by becoming anguished lest they do not believe. Indeed God is Knower of what they do and He will requite them for it.
وَٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِيۤ أَرْسَلَ ٱلرِّيَاحَ فَتُثِيرُ سَحَاباً فَسُقْنَاهُ إِلَىٰ بَلَدٍ مَّيِّتٍ فَأَحْيَيْنَا بِهِ ٱلأَرْضَ بَعْدَ مَوْتِهَا كَذَلِكَ ٱلنُّشُورُ,And it is God Who unleashes the winds al-riyāha a variant reading has al-rīha and they raise clouds fa-tuthīru’l-sahāba the imperfect tense here is used to narrate the past that is they stir them up then We drive them there is a shift here from the third person to the first person address to a dead land read mayyitin or maytin wherein is no plant life and therewith revive the earth of that land after it has been dead after its having been dried-out. In other words We made seeds and grass grow in it Such will be the Raising that is the Resurrection and the bringing of the dead back to life.
مَن كَانَ يُرِيدُ ٱلْعِزَّةَ فَلِلَّهِ ٱلْعِزَّةُ جَمِيعاً إِلَيْهِ يَصْعَدُ ٱلْكَلِمُ ٱلطَّيِّبُ وَٱلْعَمَلُ ٱلصَّالِحُ يَرْفَعُهُ وَٱلَّذِينَ يَمْكُرُونَ ٱلسَّيِّئَاتِ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ شَدِيدٌ وَمَكْرُ أُوْلَئِكَ هُوَ يَبُورُ,Whoever desires glory should know that all glory belongs to God in this world and in the Hereafter and it cannot be obtained from Him except through obedience to Him so let such a one be obedient to Him. To Him ascends good words that is to say He is aware of such good words and these are statements such as ‘there is no god except God’ and the like; and as for righteous action He exalts it He accepts it; but those who plot evil schemes against the Prophet — as was the case at the council assembly in the way of imprisoning him killing him or expelling him as mentioned in sūrat al-Anfāl Q. 830 — theirs shall be a severe chastisement and their plotting shall come to nothing it shall be ruined.
وَٱللَّهُ خَلَقَكُمْ مِّن تُرَابٍ ثُمَّ مِن نُّطْفَةٍ ثُمَّ جَعَلَكُمْ أَزْوَاجاً وَمَا تَحْمِلُ مِنْ أُنْثَىٰ وَلاَ تَضَعُ إِلاَّ بِعِلْمِهِ وَمَا يُعَمَّرُ مِن مُّعَمَّرٍ وَلاَ يُنقَصُ مِنْ عُمُرِهِ إِلاَّ فِي كِتَابٍ إِنَّ ذَلِكَ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ يَسِيرٌ,And God created you from dust by having created your father Adam from it then from a drop of seminal fluid in other words from sperm by creating his seed from it; then He made you pairs males and females. And no female bears or brings forth except with His knowledge illā bi-‘ilmihi is a circumstantial qualifier in other words ‘except that it is known by Him’ and no long-living person is given long life in other words the life of none is increased for one who has a long life nor is anything diminished of his life in other words of the life of that same long-living person or some other long-living person but it is recorded in a Book namely the Preserved Tablet. Surely that is easy for God.
وَمَا يَسْتَوِي ٱلْبَحْرَانِ هَـٰذَا عَذْبٌ فُرَاتٌ سَآئِغٌ شَرَابُهُ وَهَـٰذَا مِلْحٌ أُجَاجٌ وَمِن كُلٍّ تَأْكُلُونَ لَحْماً طَرِيّاً وَتَسْتَخْرِجُونَ حِلْيَةً تَلْبَسُونَهَا وَتَرَى ٱلْفُلْكَ فِيهِ مَوَاخِرَ لِتَبْتَغُواْ مِن فَضْلِهِ وَلَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ,Nor are the two kinds of seas alike this one is extremely sweet pleasant to drink and that one is salty extremely bitter. Yet from each of the two you eat fresh meat namely fish and obtain from the salt — and it is also said from both of them — ornaments which you wear namely pearls and coral. And you see you sight the ships therein in each of the two seas ploughing through mawākhira in other words tamkhuru’l-mā’a meaning ‘it cleaves it as it makes its way through it coming and going by the same wind that you may seek of His bounty exalted be He through commerce and that perhaps you may give thanks to God for this bounty.
يُولِجُ ٱلْلَّيْلَ فِي ٱلنَّهَارِ وَيُولِجُ ٱلنَّهَارَ فِي ٱلْلَّيْلِ وَسَخَّرَ ٱلشَّمْسَ وَٱلْقَمَرَ كُلٌّ يَجْرِي لأَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّى ذَلِكُمُ ٱللَّهُ رَبُّكُمْ لَهُ ٱلْمُلْكُ وَٱلَّذِينَ تَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِهِ مَا يَمْلِكُونَ مِن قِطْمِيرٍ,He God makes the night pass enter into the day so that it becomes longer and He makes the day pass into the night so that it becomes longer and He has disposed the sun and the moon each of them moving in its course to an appointed term — to the Day of Resurrection. That is God your Lord; to Him belongs all sovereignty. As for those on whom you call whom you worship besides Him in other words other than Him — and they are the idols — they do not possess even so much as the husk of a date-stone.
إِن تَدْعُوهُمْ لاَ يَسْمَعُواْ دُعَآءَكُمْ وَلَوْ سَمِعُواْ مَا ٱسْتَجَابُواْ لَكُمْ وَيَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ يَكْفُرُونَ بِشِرْكِـكُمْ وَلاَ يُنَبِّئُكَ مِثْلُ خَبِيرٍ,If you call on them they will not hear your call and even if they heard —hypothetically speaking — they would not be able to respond to you; and on the Day of Resurrection they will disown your idolatrous associations in other words your associating them with God in power that is to say they will declare themselves innocent of you and of your worship of them. And none can inform you about the state in the two abodes like One Who is Aware Knower and this is God exalted be He.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّاسُ أَنتُمُ ٱلْفُقَرَآءُ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ وَٱللَّهُ هُوَ ٱلْغَنِيُّ ٱلْحَمِيدُ,O mankind! You are the ones who are in need of God in every state. And God He is the Independent without any need of His creatures the Praised the One Who is praised in whatever He does with them.
إِن يَشَأْ يُذْهِبْكُـمْ وَيَأْتِ بِخَلْقٍ جَدِيدٍ,If He will He can take you away and bring about a new creation instead of you.
وَمَا ذَلِكَ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ بِعَزِيزٍ,And that is not an arduous thing for God.
وَلاَ تَزِرُ وَازِرَةٌ وِزْرَ أُخْرَىٰ وَإِن تَدْعُ مُثْقَلَةٌ إِلَىٰ حِمْلِهَا لاَ يُحْمَلْ مِنْهُ شَيْءٌ وَلَوْ كَانَ ذَا قُرْبَىٰ إِنَّمَا تُنذِرُ ٱلَّذِينَ يَخْشَوْنَ رَبَّهُمْ بِٱلْغَيْبِ وَأَقَامُواْ ٱلصَّلاَةَ وَمَن تَزَكَّىٰ فَإِنَّمَا يَتَزَكَّىٰ لِنَفْسِهِ وَإِلَى ٱللَّهِ ٱلْمَصِيرُ,And no burdened soul shall bear the burden of another sinful soul. And should one soul burdened heavily with sin call for some of its burden to be borne by another nothing of it will be borne even if the one called be a relative kin such as a father or a son — the impossibility of ‘having something borne by another’ in both instances is something ordained by God. You can only warn those who fear their Lord in secret in other words those who fear Him despite not having seen Him for they are the ones to benefit from the warning and observe the prayer maintain performance of it. For whoever purifies himself cleansing himself of idolatry and other similar abominations is purifying himself only for the sake of his own soul because the reforming of his self pertains to him. And to God is the end of the journeying the return in the Hereafter when He will requite according to deeds.
وَمَا يَسْتَوِي ٱلأَعْمَىٰ وَٱلْبَصِيرُ,Nor are the blind and the seer equal that is the disbeliever and the believer are not equal
وَلاَ ٱلظُّلُمَاتُ وَلاَ ٱلنُّورُ,nor darkness — disbelief — and light — faith;
وَلاَ ٱلظِّلُّ وَلاَ ٱلْحَرُورُ,nor shade and torrid heat namely Paradise and the Fire;
وَمَا يَسْتَوِي ٱلأَحْيَآءُ وَلاَ ٱلأَمْوَاتُ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُسْمِعُ مَن يَشَآءُ وَمَآ أَنتَ بِمُسْمِعٍ مَّن فِي ٱلْقُبُورِ,nor are the living equal to the dead the believers and the disbelievers respectively the addition of the particle lā ‘nor’ in all three instances is for emphasis. Indeed God makes to hear whomever He will to be guided so that such a person then responds to Him by embracing faith. But you cannot make those who are in the graves to hear namely the disbelievers — whom He has likened to the dead — to hear and so respond.
إِنْ أَنتَ إِلاَّ نَذِيرٌ,You are but a warner to them.
إِنَّآ أَرْسَلْنَاكَ بِٱلْحَقِّ بَشِيراً وَنَذِيراً وَإِن مِّنْ أُمَّةٍ إِلاَّ خَلاَ فِيهَا نَذِيرٌ,Truly We have sent you with the truth with right guidance as a bearer of good tidings to him who responds to it and a warner to him who does not respond to it. And there is not a community but there has passed there has been in it a warner a prophet to warn it.
وَإِن يُكَذِّبُوكَ فَقَدْ كَذَّبَ ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ جَآءَتْهُمْ رُسُلُهُم بِٱلْبَيِّنَاتِ وَبِٱلزُّبُرِ وَبِٱلْكِتَابِ ٱلْمُنِيرِ,And if they that is the people of Meccans deny you those before them also denied their messengers brought them manifest signs miracles and with scriptures such as the scrolls of Abraham and with the illuminating Book namely the Torah and the Gospel so endure patiently as they endured.
ثُمَّ أَخَذْتُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ فَكَيْفَ كَانَ نَكِيرِ,Then I seized those who disbelieved for their denial and how was My abhorrence! how was My rebuttal against them by way of punishment and destruction in other words it was appropriate.
أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ أنزَلَ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مَآءً فَأَخْرَجْنَا بِهِ ثَمَرَاتٍ مُّخْتَلِفاً أَلْوَانُهَا وَمِنَ ٱلْجِبَالِ جُدَدٌ بِيضٌ وَحُمْرٌ مُّخْتَلِفٌ أَلْوَانُهَا وَغَرَابِيبُ سُودٌ,Have you not seen have you not realised that God sends down water from the heaven wherewith We bring forth there is here a shift from the third person to the first person address fruits of diverse hues such as green red and yellow fruits and so on? And in the mountains are streaks judad is the plural of judda which is a mountain trail or the like white and red and yellow of diverse hues some intense and some pale and others pitch-black? gharābību sūd is a supplement to judadun ‘streaks’ meaning dark-black rocks one commonly says aswad ghirbīb but rarely ghirbīb aswad.
وَمِنَ ٱلنَّاسِ وَٱلدَّوَآبِّ وَٱلأَنْعَامِ مُخْتَلِفٌ أَلْوَانُهُ كَذَلِكَ إِنَّمَا يَخْشَى ٱللَّهَ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ ٱلْعُلَمَاءُ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ غَفُورٌ,And of humans and beasts and cattle there are diverse hues likewise like the diversity of the hues of fruits and mountains. Indeed only those of God’s servants who have knowledge fear Him in contrast to the ignorant such as the disbelievers of Mecca. Truly God is Mighty in His kingdom Forgiving of the sins of His faithful servants.
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يَتْلُونَ كِتَابَ ٱللَّهِ وَأَقَامُواْ ٱلصَّلاَةَ وَأَنفَقُواْ مِمَّا رَزَقْنَاهُمْ سِرّاً وَعَلاَنِيَةً يَرْجُونَ تِجَارَةً لَّن تَبُورَ,Indeed those who recite the Book of God and observe prayer they maintain performance of it and expend of what We have provided them secretly and openly to give as alms and otherwise anticipate a commerce that will never be ruined
لِيُوَفِّيَهُمْ أُجُورَهُمْ وَيَزِيدَهُم مِّن فَضْلِهِ إِنَّهُ غَفُورٌ شَكُورٌ,that He may pay them in full their rewards the reward for their mentioned deeds and enrich them out of His bounty. Truly He is Forgiving of their sins Appreciative of their obedience.
وَٱلَّذِيۤ أَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَيْكَ مِنَ ٱلْكِتَابِ هُوَ ٱلْحَقُّ مُصَدِّقاً لِّمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ بِعِبَادِهِ لَخَبِيرٌ بَصِيرٌ,And that which We have revealed to you of the Book the Qur’ān is the truth confirming what was revealed before it in other words confirming the Books that came before it. Indeed with regard to His servants God is truly Aware and Seeing knowing both their inward and outward aspects.
ثُمَّ أَوْرَثْنَا ٱلْكِتَابَ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱصْطَفَيْنَا مِنْ عِبَادِنَا فَمِنْهُمْ ظَالِمٌ لِّنَفْسِهِ وَمِنْهُمْ مُّقْتَصِدٌ وَمِنْهُمْ سَابِقٌ بِٱلْخَيْرَاتِ بِإِذُنِ ٱللَّهِ ذَلِكَ هُوَ ٱلْفَضْلُ ٱلْكَبِيرُ,Then We gave the Book the Qur’ān to those of Our servants whom We chose namely your community. Yet some of them are those who wrong themselves by failing to act fully in accordance with it and some of them are moderate acting in accordance with it most of the time and some are those who take the lead in performing good works so that in addition to his acquiring knowledge he disseminates it and shows others the way to proper conduct as well as acting in accordance with the Qur’ān by the leave of God by His will. That bequest to them of the Book is the greatest favour!
جَنَّاتُ عَدْنٍ يَدْخُلُونَهَا يُحَلَّوْنَ فِيهَا مِنْ أَسَاوِرَ مِن ذَهَبٍ وَلُؤْلُؤاً وَلِبَاسُهُمْ فِيهَا حَرِيرٌ,Gardens of Eden as a permanent residence into which they will be admitted the three types of servants mentioned read active yadkhulūnahā ‘they will enter it’ or passive yudkhalūnahā ‘into which they will be admitted’ as the predicate of the subject jannāt ‘gardens’ — therein they will be adorned yuhallawna is a second predicate with some bracelets of gold and pearls studded with gold and their garments therein will be of silk.
وَقَالُواْ ٱلْحَمْدُ للَّهِ ٱلَّذِيۤ أَذْهَبَ عَنَّا ٱلْحَزَنَ إِنَّ رَبَّنَا لَغَفُورٌ شَكُورٌ,And they will say ‘Praise be to God Who has removed all grief from us. Truly our Lord is Forgiving of sins Appreciative of obedience
ٱلَّذِيۤ أَحَلَّنَا دَارَ ٱلْمُقَامَةِ مِن فَضْلِهِ لاَ يَمَسُّنَا فِيهَا نَصَبٌ وَلاَ يَمَسُّنَا فِيهَا لُغُوبٌ,Who out of His favour has made us to dwell in the Abode of everlasting Stay wherein no toil shall touch us nor shall we be touched by any fatigue’ lack of strength caused by exhaustion and this is because religious obligations no longer apply therein the second of these ‘fatigue’ which is consequent upon the first ‘toil’ is mentioned in order to make explicit the non-existence of any toil in Paradise.
وَٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لَهُمْ نَارُ جَهَنَّمَ لاَ يُقْضَىٰ عَلَيْهِمْ فَيَمُوتُواْ وَلاَ يُخَفَّفُ عَنْهُمْ مِّنْ عَذَابِهَا كَذَلِكَ نَجْزِي كُلَّ كَفُورٍ,And as for those who disbelieve there will be for them the fire of Hell they will neither be done away with through death so that they may die and find rest nor will any aspect of its chastisement be lightened for them not even for a single moment. In this way in the way that We requite these We requite every ingrate every disbeliever read yujzā kullu kafūrin ‘every ingrate is so requited’; or najzī kulla kafūrin ‘so We requite every ingrate’.
وَهُمْ يَصْطَرِخُونَ فِيهَا رَبَّنَآ أَخْرِجْنَا نَعْمَلْ صَالِحاً غَيْرَ ٱلَّذِي كُـنَّا نَعْمَلُ أَوَلَمْ نُعَمِّرْكُمْ مَّا يَتَذَكَّرُ فِيهِ مَن تَذَكَّرَ وَجَآءَكُمُ ٱلنَّذِيرُ فَذُوقُواْ فَمَا لِلظَّالِمِينَ مِن نَّصِيرٍ,While therein they will be crying out calling for help in distress howling and saying ‘Our Lord! Bring us forth from it and we will act righteously other than how we used to act’. But it will be said to them ‘Did We not give you long life enough time in which to take heed for him who would take heed? And moreover the warner the Messenger came to you but you did not respond to his call so taste now this chastisement! For the evildoers the disbelievers have no helper’ to ward off from them the chastisement.
إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَالِمُ غَيْبِ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ إِنَّهُ عَلِيمٌ بِذَاتِ ٱلصُّدُورِ,Truly God is Knower of the Unseen of the heavens and the earth; truly He knows well what is in the breasts what is in the hearts — thus there is all the more reason that He should also have knowledge of other things given the way people are.
هُوَ ٱلَّذِي جَعَلَكُمْ خَلاَئِفَ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ فَمَن كَفَرَ فَعَلَيْهِ كُفْرُهُ وَلاَ يَزِيدُ ٱلْكَافِرِينَ كُفْرُهُمْ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ إِلاَّ مَقْتاً وَلاَ يَزِيدُ ٱلْكَافِرِينَ كُفْرُهُمْ إِلاَّ خَسَاراً,It is He Who made you successors in the earth khalā’if ‘successors’ is the plural of khalīfa in other words one succeeding the other. So whoever disbelieves of you his disbelief will be to his own detriment that is the evil consequences of his disbelief will be so. And their disbelief does not increase the disbelievers with their Lord in anything except disfavour wrath. And their disbelief does not increase the disbelievers in anything except loss of the reward of the Hereafter.
قُلْ أَرَأَيْتُمْ شُرَكَآءَكُمُ ٱلَّذِينَ تَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ أَرُونِي مَاذَا خَلَقُواْ مِنَ ٱلأَرْضِ أَمْ لَهُمْ شِرْكٌ فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ أَمْ آتَيْنَاهُمْ كِتَاباً فَهُمْ عَلَىٰ بَيِّنَةٍ مِّنْهُ بَلْ إِن يَعِدُ ٱلظَّالِمُونَ بَعْضُهُم بَعْضاً إِلاَّ غُرُوراً,Say ‘Have you considered your associates on whom you call those whom you worship besides God? in other words other than God — and they are the idols whom you asserted to be partners of God exalted be He. Show me apprise me of what part of the earth they have created. Or do they have some partnership some share alongside God in the creation of the heavens?’ Or have We given them a scripture so that they are acting upon a clear proof a definitive argument therefrom? to the effect that they have some partnership with Me? Nothing of the sort! Nay but the evildoers the disbelievers promise one another nothing but delusion falsehood when they say that the idols will intercede for them.
إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُمْسِكُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضَ أَن تَزُولاَ وَلَئِن زَالَتَآ إِنْ أَمْسَكَهُمَا مِنْ أَحَدٍ مِّن بَعْدِهِ إِنَّهُ كَانَ حَلِيماً غَفُوراً,Truly God sustains the heavens and the earth lest they disappear in other words He prevents them from disappearing. And if wa-la-in the lām is for oaths they were to disappear there is none that can sustain them after Him in other words other than Him. Truly He is ever Forbearing Forgiving in deferring the punishment of the disbelievers.
وَأَقْسَمُواْ بِٱللَّهِ جَهْدَ أَيْمَانِهِمْ لَئِن جَآءَهُمْ نَذِيرٌ لَّيَكُونُنَّ أَهْدَىٰ مِنْ إِحْدَى ٱلأُمَمِ فَلَمَّا جَآءَهُمْ نَذِيرٌ مَّا زَادَهُمْ إِلاَّ نُفُوراً,And they that is the disbelievers of Mecca swore by God their most solemn oaths they swore with utmost effort to be sincere in them that if a warner a messenger were to come to them they would be more readily guided than any one of the communities than the Jews the Christians or others in other words more readily guided than any one of these — having themselves seen the extent to which these groups called each other liars given that The Jews say ‘The Christians stand on nothing’ and the Christians say ‘The Jews stand on nothing’ Q. 2113. But when a warner namely Muhammad (s) did come to them this coming of his only increased them in aversion further away from right guidance
ٱسْتِكْبَاراً فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَمَكْرَ ٱلسَّيِّىءِ وَلاَ يَحِيقُ ٱلْمَكْرُ ٱلسَّيِّىءُ إِلاَّ بِأَهْلِهِ فَهَلْ يَنظُرُونَ إِلاَّ سُنَّتَ ٱلأَوَّلِينَ فَلَن تَجِدَ لِسُنَّتِ ٱللَّهِ تَبْدِيلاً وَلَن تَجِدَ لِسُنَّتِ ٱللَّهِ تَحْوِيلاً,acting with disdain in the land against faith istikbāran fī’l-ardi an object denoting reason and devising acts of evil in the way of idolatry and otherwise; and evil schemes will beset surround only their authors namely the one who devises such evil the qualifying of makr ‘scheme’ with the noun al-sayyi’ ‘evil’ is intrinsic to the fact that it is a scheme and so the annexation of the former to the latter is said to be alternative usage in which the annexed term is implied as a precaution against annexing a noun to an adjective. So do they expect do they await anything but the precedent of the ancients? God’s way of dealing with them such as chastising them for their denial of the messengers? Yet you will never find any change in God’s precedent and you will never find any revision in God’s precedent that is to say chastisement is never replaced by anything else nor is it ever meted out other than to the one who deserves it.
أَوَلَمْ يَسِيرُواْ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ فَيَنظُرُواْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَاقِبَةُ ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ وَكَانُوۤاْ أَشَدَّ مِنْهُمْ قُوَّةً وَمَا كَانَ ٱللَّهُ لِيُعْجِزَهُ مِن شَيْءٍ فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَلاَ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ إِنَّهُ كَانَ عَلِيماً قَدِيراً,Have they not travelled in the land and seen the nature of the consequence for those who were before them — and they were mightier than these in power? but still God destroyed them for their denial of the messengers. And God is not such that anything in the heavens or in the earth can escape Him pre-empt Him or elude Him. Truly He is ever Knower of all things Omnipotent.
وَلَوْ يُؤَاخِذُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلنَّاسَ بِمَا كَسَبُواْ مَا تَرَكَ عَلَىٰ ظَهْرِهَا مِن دَآبَّةٍ وَلَـٰكِن يُؤَخِّرُهُمْ إِلَىٰ أَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّى فَإِذَا جَآءَ أَجَلُهُمْ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ بِعِبَادِهِ بَصِيراً,Were God to take mankind to task for what they have acquired of acts of disobedience He would not leave on its surface that is the earth’s a single creature a single living thing moving thereon. But He reprieves them to an appointed term namely to the Day of Resurrection. And when their term comes — then truly they will know that God is ever Seer of His servants and so He will requite them according to the nature of their deeds rewarding the believers and punishing the disbelievers.
يسۤ,Yā sīn God knows best what He means by these letters.
وَٱلْقُرْآنِ ٱلْحَكِيمِ,By the Definitive Qur’ān made definitive by its marvellous arrangement and unique meanings
إِنَّكَ لَمِنَ ٱلْمُرْسَلِينَ,you O Muhammad (s) are indeed of those sent by God
عَلَىٰ صِرَاطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ,on a ‘alā is semantically connected to the preceding statement straight path that is you follow the way of the prophets before you enjoining the affirmation of God’s Oneness and guidance the emphasis expressed by the oath in ‘by the definitive Qur’ān’ and the remainder of the statement is a response to the disbelievers’ saying to him ‘You have not been sent by God!’ Q. 1343.
تَنزِيلَ ٱلْعَزِيزِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ,A revelation from the Mighty in His kingdom the Merciful to His creatures tanzīla’l-‘azīzi’l-rahīm is the predicate of an implicit subject namely al-qur’ān
لِتُنذِرَ قَوْماً مَّآ أُنذِرَ آبَآؤُهُمْ فَهُمْ غَافِلُونَ,that you may warn therewith a people qawman connected to tanzīla ‘a revelation’ whose fathers were not warned in the period of the interval al-fatra so they this people are oblivious to faith and right guidance.
لَقَدْ حَقَّ ٱلْقَوْلُ عَلَىٰ أَكْثَرِهِمْ فَهُمْ لاَ يُؤمِنُونَ,The word for chastisement has already proved true it has become due for most of them for they in other words most of them will not believe.
إِنَّا جَعَلْنَا فِيۤ أَعْناقِهِمْ أَغْلاَلاً فَهِىَ إِلَى ٱلأَذْقَانِ فَهُم مُّقْمَحُونَ,Indeed We have put fetters around their necks to bind to them their hands because ghull is a fetter that shackles the hands to the neck such that they the hands are bound up to the chins adhqān is the plural of dhaqan which is where the two sides of the beard meet so that their heads are upturned they are unable to lower them this statement is figurative and is meant to indicate their inability to yield to faith or to lower their heads to it.
وَجَعَلْنَا مِن بَيْنِ أَيْدِيهِمْ سَدّاً ومِنْ خَلْفِهِمْ سَدّاً فَأغْشَيْنَاهُمْ فَهُمْ لاَ يُبْصِرُونَ,And We have set before them a barrier read saddan or suddan in both instances and behind them a barrier; so We have covered them so they do not see — this is also figurative depicting the way in which the paths of faith are closed to them.
وَسَوَآءُ عَلَيْهِمْ أَأَنذَرْتَهُمْ أَمْ لَمْ تُنذِرْهُمْ لاَ يُؤمِنُونَ,And it is the same to them whether you warn them read a-andhartuhum pronouncing both hamzas; or by substituting an alif for the second one; or by not pronouncing the second one but inserting an alif between the one not pronounced and the other one or without the insertion or do not warn them they will not believe.
إِنَّمَا تُنذِرُ مَنِ ٱتَّبَعَ ٱلذِّكْرَ وَخشِيَ ٱلرَّحْمـٰنَ بِٱلْغَيْبِ فَبَشِّرْهُ بِمَغْفِرَةٍ وَأَجْرٍ كَرِيمٍ,You can only warn in other words your warning will only benefit him who follows the Remembrance the Qur’ān and fears the Compassionate One in secret who fears Him despite not having seen Him; so give him the good tidings of forgiveness and a noble reward namely Paradise.
إِنَّا نَحْنُ نُحْيِي ٱلْمَوْتَىٰ وَنَكْتُبُ مَا قَدَّمُواْ وَآثَارَهُمْ وَكُلَّ شيْءٍ أَحْصَيْنَاهُ فِيۤ إِمَامٍ مُّبِينٍ,Truly it is We Who bring the dead to life for the resurrection and record in the Preserved Tablet what they have sent ahead during their lives of good or evil that they may be requited for it and their vestiges what conduct was followed after them as good practice. And everything kulla shay’in is in the accusative because of the verb that governs it and is the following We have numbered We have recorded precisely in a clear register a clear Book namely the Preserved Tablet.
وَٱضْرِبْ لَهُمْ مَّثَلاً أَصْحَابَ ٱلقَرْيَةِ إِذْ جَآءَهَا ٱلْمُرْسَلُونَ,And strike for them as a similitude mathalan is the first direct object the inhabitants ashāba is the second direct object of the town of Antioch Antākya when the messengers namely Jesus’s disciples came to it idh jā’ahā’l-mursalūna is an inclusive substitution for ashāba’l-qaryati ‘the inhabitants of the town’.
إِذْ أَرْسَلْنَآ إِلَيْهِمُ ٱثْنَيْنِ فَكَذَّبُوهُمَا فَعَزَّزْنَا بِثَالِثٍ فَقَالُوۤاْ إِنَّآ إِلَيْكُمْ مُّرْسَلُونَ,When We sent to them two men and they denied them both from idh arsalnā ilayhim ithnayni fa-kadhdhabūhumā to the end is a substitution for the previous idh ‘when’ so We reinforced them read fa-‘azaznā or fa-‘azzaznā in other words We reinforced the two men with a third and they said ‘We have indeed been sent to you by God’.
قَالُواْ مَآ أَنتُمْ إِلاَّ بَشَرٌ مِّثْلُنَا وَمَآ أَنَزلَ ٱلرَّحْمَـٰنُ مِن شَيْءٍ إِنْ أَنتُمْ إِلاَّ تَكْذِبُونَ,They said ‘You are nothing but humans like us and the Compassionate One has revealed nothing. You are only lying!’
قَالُواْ رَبُّنَا يَعْلَمُ إِنَّآ إِلَيْكُمْ لَمُرْسَلُونَ,They said ‘Our Lord knows qālū rabbunā ya‘lamu functions like an oath. Emphasis is intensified by this oath and also by the addition of the lām to what was before simply mursalūna ‘we have been sent’ to counter their intensified denial that we have indeed been sent to you by Him!
وَمَا عَلَيْنَآ إِلاَّ ٱلْبَلاَغُ ٱلْمُبِينُ,And our duty is only to communicate in clear terms’ to deliver the Message clearly and manifestly with plain proofs such as the curing of the blind the leper and the diseased and the bringing of the dead back to life.
قَالُوۤاْ إِنَّا تَطَيَّرْنَا بِكُمْ لَئِن لَّمْ تَنتَهُواْ لَنَرْجُمَنَّكُمْ وَلَيَمَسَّنَّكُمْ مِّنَّا عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,They said ‘We augur ill of you for we have been deprived of rain because of you. If la-in the lām is for oaths you do not desist we will surely stone you and there shall befall you at our hands a painful chastisement’.
قَالُواْ طَائِرُكُم مَّعَكُمْ أَئِن ذُكِّرْتُم بَلْ أَنتُمْ قَوْمٌ مُّسْرِفُونَ,They said ‘May your augury of ill be with you! as punishment for your disbelief. What! Even if a-in the interrogative hamza has been added to the conditional in ‘if’ the hamza may be pronounced or elided but in both cases add an alif between it and the other one it be that you are being reminded? even if you are being admonished and made to fear God’s chastisement? the response to the conditional has been omitted that is to say ‘do you augur ill and disbelieve even if it be that you are being admonished?’ and this response constitutes the object of the interrogative which is meant rhetorically as a rebuke. Nay but you are a profligate people!’ who transgressing the bounds set by God with your practice of idolatry.
وَجَآءَ مِنْ أَقْصَا ٱلْمَدِينَةِ رَجُلٌ يَسْعَىٰ قَالَ يٰقَوْمِ ٱتَّبِعُواْ ٱلْمُرْسَلِينَ,And there came a man from the furthest part of the city — this was Habīb the carpenter who had believed in these messengers and whose house lay at the far end of the city — hastening with a hurried pace after he had heard that the people had denied the messengers. He said ‘O my people follow the messengers!
ٱتَّبِعُواْ مَن لاَّ يَسْأَلُكُمْ أَجْراً وَهُمْ مُّهْتَدُونَ,Follow ittabi‘ū this reiterates the preceding ittabi‘ū them who do not ask you for any reward in return for delivering to you the message and who are rightly guided. And so he was asked ‘Do you follow their religion?’ So he replied
وَمَا لِيَ لاَ أَعْبُدُ ٱلَّذِي فَطَرَنِي وَإِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ,And why should I not worship Him Who originated me Him Who created me — in other words there is nothing to prevent me from worshipping Him when the necessitating factors for this exist and the same applies to you — and to Whom you shall be returned? after death whereupon He will requite you for your disbelief.
أَأَتَّخِذُ مِن دُونِهِ آلِهَةً إِن يُرِدْنِ ٱلرَّحْمَـٰنُ بِضُرٍّ لاَّ تُغْنِ عَنِّي شَفَاعَتُهُمْ شَيْئاً وَلاَ يُنقِذُونَ,Shall I take a-attakhidu regarding the two hamzas here the same applies as mentioned with regard to a-andhartuhum above; this is an interrogative meant as a denial besides Him in other words other than Him other gods idols whose intercession that intercession of theirs which you assert if the Compassionate One should wish me any harm will not avail me in any way nor will they be able to save me? wa-lā yunqidhūn is an adjectival qualification of ālihatan ‘gods’.
إِنِّيۤ إِذاً لَّفِي ضَلاَلٍ مُّبِينٍ,Truly then in other words in the case of me worshipping gods other than God I would be in manifest error.
إِنِّيۤ آمَنتُ بِرَبِّكُمْ فَٱسْمَعُونِ,Lo! I believe in your Lord. So listen to me!’ in other words hear what I have to say; but they stoned him and he died.
قِيلَ ٱدْخُلِ ٱلْجَنَّةَ قَالَ يٰلَيْتَ قَوْمِي يَعْلَمُونَ,It was said to him upon his death ‘Enter Paradise!’ — but it is also said that he entered it while he was still alive. He said ‘O yā is for calling attention to something would that my people knew
بِمَا غَفَرَ لِي رَبِّي وَجَعَلَنِي مِنَ ٱلْمُكْرَمِينَ,with what munificence my Lord has forgiven me would that they knew of His great forgiveness and made me of the honoured ones!’
وَمَآ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَىٰ قَوْمِهِ مِن بَعْدِهِ مِن جُندٍ مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ وَمَا كُنَّا مُنزِلِينَ,And We did not send mā here is for negation down on his people namely Habīb’s after him after his death any host from the heaven that is any angels to destroy them nor do We ever send down any angels to destroy anyone.
إِن كَانَتْ إِلاَّ صَيْحَةً وَاحِدَةً فَإِذَا هُمْ خَامِدُونَ,It their punishment was but one Cry — Gabriel gave a cry to them — and lo! they were extinguished silent dead.
يٰحَسْرَةً عَلَى ٱلْعِبَادِ مَا يَأْتِيهِمْ مِّن رَّسُولٍ إِلاَّ كَانُواْ بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِئُونَ,Ah the anguish for servants such as these and their like from among those who denied the messengers and were destroyed this word hasra denotes ‘extreme agony’; the vocative here is being used metaphorically in other words ‘It is time for you O anguish so come now!’. Never did a messenger come to them but that they mocked him this statement is given as an explanation of the cause thereof of the ‘agony’ since it the statement entails their mockery which itself results in their being destroyed and which in turn is the cause of the ‘anguish’.
أَلَمْ يَرَوْاْ كَمْ أَهْلَكْنَا قَبْلَهُمْ مِّنَ ٱلْقُرُونِ أَنَّهُمْ إِلَيْهِمْ لاَ يَرْجِعُونَ,Have they — that is those inhabitants of Mecca who said to the Prophet ‘You have not been sent by God!’ Q. 1343 — not seen not come to know the interrogative is meant rhetorically as an affirmative how many kam here is predicative as opposed to interrogative in other words it is to be understood as kathīran ‘many’; it is operated by the statement that comes next below and it comments on the operative clause for the statement that preceded it; the meaning then is as follows indeed many generations communities We have destroyed before them how that they the ones destroyed never return? to those deniers who are now alive? So will they not learn from their example? from annahum ‘how that they’ to the end of the verse is a substitution for the preceding clause kam ahlaknā qablahum mina’l-qurūni bearing in mind the aforementioned general meaning.
وَإِن كُلٌّ لَّمَّا جَمِيعٌ لَّدَيْنَا مُحْضَرُونَ,And indeed in is either for negation or is in its softened form every one of them that is every single creature kullun is the subject will be gathered jamī‘un is the predicate of the subject before Us at the Scene following their resurrection arraigned muhdarūna is a second predicate for the Reckoning read lammā with the sense of illā or lamā with the lām functioning as a separator and the mā being extra.
وَآيَةٌ لَّهُمُ ٱلأَرْضُ ٱلْمَيْتَةُ أَحْيَيْنَاهَا وَأَخْرَجْنَا مِنْهَا حَبّاً فَمِنْهُ يَأْكُلُونَ,And a sign for them of the truth of resurrection wa-āyatun lahum is a preceding predicate is the dead earth read maytatu or mayyitatu which We revive with water ahyaynāhā is the subject and out of which We bring forth grain such as wheat so that they eat thereof;
وَجَعَلْنَا فِيهَا جَنَّاتٍ مِّن نَّخِيلٍ وَأَعْنَابٍ وَفَجَّرْنَا فِيهَا مِنَ ٱلْعُيُونِ,and We have placed therein gardens orchards of date-palms and vines and We have caused a number of springs to gush forth therein
لِيَأْكُلُواْ مِن ثَمَرِهِ وَمَا عَمِلَتْهُ أَيْدِيهِمْ أَفَلاَ يَشْكُرُونَ,that they might eat of its fruits read thamarihi or thumurihi in other words of the fruits of the mentioned date-palms and otherwise; but it was not their hands that made it namely they did not cultivate the fruits. Will they not then give thanks? for His favours to them exalted be He?
سُبْحَانَ ٱلَّذِي خَلَق ٱلأَزْوَاجَ كُلَّهَا مِمَّا تُنبِتُ ٱلأَرْضُ وَمِنْ أَنفُسِهِمْ وَمِمَّا لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ,Glory be to Him Who created all the pairs the specimens of what the earth produces of seeds and other things and of themselves of males and females and of what they do not know of marvellous and strange creatures.
وَآيَةٌ لَّهُمُ ٱلَّيلُ نَسْلَخُ مِنْهُ ٱلنَّهَارَ فَإِذَا هُم مُّظْلِمُونَ,And a sign for them of the tremendous power of God is the night from which We strip We separate the day and behold they find themselves in darkness passing into the darkness of the night.
وَٱلشَّمْسُ تَجْرِي لِمُسْتَقَرٍّ لَّهَـا ذَلِكَ تَقْدِيرُ ٱلْعَزِيزِ ٱلْعَلِيمِ,And the sun which runs from wa’l-shamsu tajrī to the end of the statement is subsumed by the introductory wa-āyatun lahum ‘and a sign for them’; alternatively it constitutes another sign for them; similar is the case with wa’l-qamara ‘and the moon’ further below to its resting-place in other words it does not overstep it. That namely its running is the ordaining of the Mighty in His kingdom the Knower of His creation.
وَٱلْقَمَرَ قَدَّرْنَاهُ مَنَازِلَ حَتَّىٰ عَادَ كَٱلعُرجُونِ ٱلْقَدِيمِ,And the moon — read wa’l-qamaru in the nominative or wa’l-qamara in the accusative; and it may be in the accusative because of a following verb that governs it We have determined it with respect to its course to run in phases — twenty eight phases in twenty eight nights of every month; it becomes concealed for two nights when the month has thirty days and for one night when it has twenty nine days — until it returns during its final phase seeming to the human eye like an aged palm-bough in other words like the stalk with a date cluster when it ages becoming delicate arched and yellowish.
لاَ ٱلشَّمْسُ يَنبَغِي لَهَآ أَن تدْرِكَ ٱلقَمَرَ وَلاَ ٱلَّيلُ سَابِقُ ٱلنَّهَارِ وَكُلٌّ فِي فَلَكٍ يَسْبَحُونَ,It does not behove — it is neither facilitated nor is it right for — the sun to catch up with the moon and so appear together with it at night nor may the night outrun the day and thus it the night never arrives before the latter ends and each kullun the nunation compensates for the missing genitive annexation that would have been constructed with al-shams ‘the sun’ al-qamar ‘the moon’ and al-nujūm ‘the stars’ of these is in an orbit swimming moving — these celestial bodies are being treated as though they were rational beings.
وَآيَةٌ لَّهُمْ أَنَّا حَمَلْنَا ذُرِّيَّتَهُمْ فِي ٱلْفُلْكِ ٱلْمَشْحُونِ,And a sign for them of Our power is that We carried their seed dhurriyatahum a variant reading has dhurriyyātihim that is to say their original ancestors in the laden Ark that is Noah’s fully-loaded ship
وَخَلَقْنَا لَهُمْ مِّن مِّثْلِهِ مَا يَرْكَبُونَ,and We have created for them the like of it that is the like of Noah’s Ark namely the small and large ships resembling it which they have made by the instruction of God exalted be He in which they ride.
وَإِن نَّشَأْ نُغْرِقْهُمْ فَلاَ صَرِيخَ لَهُمْ وَلاَ هُمْ يُنقَذُونَ,And if We will We drown them despite the existence of ships for them to ride safely in whereat they have no one to call to none to succour them nor are they rescued delivered —
إِلاَّ رَحْمَةً مِّنَّا وَمَتَاعاً إِلَىٰ حِينٍ,except by a mercy from Us and for an enjoyment until some time in other words they can only be saved by Our showing them mercy and Our permitting them to enjoy those pleasures of theirs until their terms of life are concluded.
وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمُ ٱتَّقُواْ مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيكُمْ وَمَا خَلْفَكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُرْحَمُونَ,And when it is said to them ‘Beware of that which is before you of the chastisement of this world as it is said to others and that which is behind you of the chastisement of the Hereafter that perhaps you might find mercy’ they turn away in aversion.
وَمَا تَأْتِيهِم مِّنْ آيَةٍ مِّنْ آيَاتِ رَبِّهِمْ إِلاَّ كَانُواْ عَنْهَا مُعْرِضِينَ,And never did a sign of the signs of their Lord come to them but that they turned away from it.
وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمْ أَنفِقُواْ مِمَّا رَزَقَكُمُ ٱلله قَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لِلَّذِينَ آمَنُوۤاْ أَنُطْعِمُ مَن لَّوْ يَشَآءُ ٱللَّهُ أَطْعَمَهُ إِنْ أَنتُمْ إِلاَّ فِي ضَلاَلٍ مُّبِينٍ,And when it is said that is when the poor ones from among the Companions of the Prophet say to them ‘Expend on us of what God has provided you’ of wealth those who disbelieve say to those who believe in mockery of them ‘Are we to feed those whom if God willed He would feed? as you are wont to believe? You in saying this to us together with this believe of yours are only in manifest error!’ — as an explicit declaration of their disbelief this statement is very effective in the way that it has been expressed.
وَيَقُولُونَ مَتَىٰ هَذَا ٱلْوَعْدُ إِن كُنتُمْ صَادِقِينَ,And they say ‘When will this promise of resurrection be fulfilled if you are being truthful?’ therein.
مَا يَنظُرُونَ إِلاَّ صَيْحَةً وَاحِدَةً تَأْخُذُهُمْ وَهُمْ يَخِصِّمُونَ,God exalted be He says They await but a single Cry namely the cry of Isrāfīl’s First Blast that will seize them while they are disputing read yakhassimūna which is actually yakhtasimūna where the vowel of the tā’ has been moved to the khā’ and it the tā’ has been assimilated with the sād in other words while they are oblivious to it busily engaged in disputes concluding bargains eating and drinking and so on; a variant reading has yakhsimūna similar in pattern to yadribūna in which case the meaning is while they dispute with one another.
فَلاَ يَسْتَطِيعُونَ تَوْصِيَةً وَلاَ إِلَىٰ أَهْلِهِمْ يَرْجِعُونَ,Then they will not be able to make any testament that is to make a bequest nor will they return to their folk from their markets and their businesses rather they will die then and there.
وَنُفِخَ فِي ٱلصُّورِ فَإِذَا هُم مِّنَ ٱلأَجْدَاثِ إِلَىٰ رَبِّهِمْ يَنسِلُونَ,And the Trumpet is blown — this is the Horn — at the second Blast for the Resurrection to take place; between the two Blasts is an interval of forty years; and lo! they those interred will be scrambling out of their graves towards their Lord emerging therefrom hurriedly.
قَالُواْ يٰوَيْلَنَا مَن بَعَثَنَا مِن مَّرْقَدِنَا هَذَا مَا وَعَدَ ٱلرَّحْمـٰنُ وَصَدَقَ ٱلْمُرْسَلُونَ,They the disbelievers among them will say ‘O yā is for calling attention to something woe to us! waylanā means halākanā ‘O our destruction!’ and it is a verbal noun which has no regular verbal conjugation Who has raised us from our place of sleep? they say this because they will have been asleep in the interval between the two blasts and will not have been punished yet. This that is this raising is that which the Compassionate One had promised and regarding which the messengers had spoken the truth’ they affirm this truth when such affirmation is no longer of any benefit to them — but it is also said that this is said to them.
إِن كَانَتْ إِلاَّ صَيْحَةً وَاحِدَةً فَإِذَا هُمْ جَمِيعٌ لَّدَيْنَا مُحْضَرُونَ,It is but a single Cry and behold they will all be arraigned before Us!
فَٱلْيَوْمَ لاَ تُظْلَمُ نَفْسٌ شَيْئاً وَلاَ تُجْزَوْنَ إِلاَّ مَا كُنْتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ,So today no soul shall be wronged in any way and you shall not be requited except the requital of what you used to do.
إِنَّ أَصْحَابَ ٱلْجَنَّةِ ٱليَوْمَ فِي شُغُلٍ فَاكِهُونَ,Indeed today the inhabitants of Paradise are busy read fī shughlin or fī shughulin oblivious to what the inhabitants of the Fire are suffering busy delighting in pleasures such as deflowering virgins — not busy with anything wearisome as there is no toil in Paradise — rejoicing blissful fākihūna is a second predicate of inna the first being fī shugulin ‘busy’;
هُمْ وَأَزْوَاجُهُمْ فِي ظِلاَلٍ عَلَى ٱلأَرَآئِكِ مُتَّكِئُونَ,they hum the subject and their spouses beneath the shade zilāl is the plural of zulla or zill and is the predicate in other words no blinding sunlight affects them reclining upon muttaki’ūna is a second predicate connected to ‘alā ‘upon’ couches arā’ik is the plural of arīka which is a bed inside a curtained canopy or the bedding therein.
لَهُمْ فِيهَا فَاكِهَةٌ وَلَهُمْ مَّا يَدَّعُونَ,They have fruits therein and therein they have whatever they call for whatever they wish for.
سَلاَمٌ قَوْلاً مِّن رَّبٍّ رَّحِيمٍ,“Peace!” salāmun is a subject — the word qawlan is its predicate that is peace by way of a word from a Lord Who is Merciful to them in other words He says to them ‘Peace be on you!’
وَٱمْتَازُواْ ٱلْيَوْمَ أَيُّهَا ٱلْمُجْرِمُونَ,And He says ‘Stand apart O you sinners on this day! in other words separate yourselves from the believers — said to them upon their mingling with the latter.
أَلَمْ أَعْهَدْ إِلَيْكُمْ يٰبَنِيۤ ءَادَمَ أَن لاَّ تَعْبُدُواْ ٱلشَّيطَانَ إِنَّهُ لَكُمْ عَدُوٌّ مُّبِينٌ,Did I not charge you command you O children of Adam by the tongues of My messengers that you should not worship Satan that you should not obey him; truly he is a manifest enemy to you one whose enmity is evident
وَأَنِ ٱعْبُدُونِي هَـٰذَا صِرَاطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ,and that you should worship Me and that you should affirm My Oneness and obey Me — that is the straight path?
وَلَقَدْ أَضَلَّ مِنْكُمْ جِبِلاًّ كَثِيراً أَفَلَمْ تَكُونُواْ تَعْقِلُونَ,For verily he has led astray from among you many a creature jibillan is the plural of jabīl similar in pattern to qadīm ‘old’; a variant reading has jubulan. Did you not use to comprehend? his enmity and his misguidance or the chastisements that befell them and so believe? And it will be said to them in the Hereafter
هَـٰذِهِ جَهَنَّمُ ٱلَّتِي كُنتُمْ تُوعَدُونَ,This is Hell which you were promised!
ٱصْلَوْهَا ٱلْيَوْمَ بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَكْفُرُونَ,Burn therein today as chastisement for that which you used to reject!’
ٱلْيَوْمَ نَخْتِمُ عَلَىٰ أَفْوَاهِهِمْ وَتُكَلِّمُنَآ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَتَشْهَدُ أَرْجُلُهُمْ بِمَا كَانُواْ يَكْسِبُونَ,Today We shall seal up their mouths namely the mouths of the disbelievers for their saying By God our Lord we were never idolaters!’ Q. 623; and their hands shall speak to Us and their feet shall bear witness as will other parts of their bodies concerning what they used to earn and so each limb will speak of that sinful action which issued from it.
وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لَطَمَسْنَا عَلَىٰ أَعْيُنِهِمْ فَٱسْتَبَقُواْ ٱلصِّرَاطَ فَأَنَّىٰ يُبْصِرُونَ,And had We willed We would have obliterated their eyesight We would have rendered them blind by obliterating them then they would have tried to advance towards the path to be on their way as usual but how would they have seen? then. In other words they would not have been to see.
وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لَمَسَخْنَاهُمْ عَلَىٰ مَكَـانَتِهِمْ فَمَا ٱسْتَطَاعُواْ مُضِيّاً وَلاَ يَرْجِعُونَ,And had We willed We would have transformed them into apes or swine or stones in their place makānatihim variant reading has makānātihim the plural of makāna meaning makān in other words ‘in their dwellings’; then they would have neither been able to go ahead nor to return in other words they would not then be able to come and go.
وَمَن نُّعَمِّرْهُ نُنَكِّـسْهُ فِي ٱلْخَلْقِ أَفَلاَ يَعْقِلُونَ,And whomever We give long life by prolonging his term of life We cause him to regress nankushu; a variant reading has 2nd verbal form nunakkishu derived from al-tankīs in creation that is in terms of his physical form so that after having enjoyed strength and youth he becomes feeble and decrepit. Will they then not understand? that One Who is able to effect such a state — with which they are familiar — is also able to resurrect that they might then become believers? a variant reading for ya‘qilūna ‘they understand’ has the second person plural ta‘qilūna ‘you understand’.
وَمَا عَلَّمْنَاهُ ٱلشِّعْرَ وَمَا يَنبَغِي لَهُ إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ ذِكْرٌ وَقُرْآنٌ مُّبِينٌ,And We did not teach him that is the Prophet poetry — this was revealed to refute their saying ‘This Qur’ān that he has brought is but poetry!’ — nor is it poetry seemly nor is it facilitated for him. It — that which he has brought — is just Remembrance an admonition and a Qur’ān that clarifies that manifests God’s rulings and other matters;
لِّيُنذِرَ مَن كَانَ حَيّاً وَيَحِقَّ ٱلْقَوْلُ عَلَى ٱلْكَافِرِينَ,that he may warn li-yundhira; or read li-tundhira ‘that you may warn’ therewith whoever is alive able to comprehend what is being said to him — and such are the believers — and that the Word of chastisement from God may be fulfilled against the disbelievers who are like the dead unable to comprehend what is said to them.
أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْاْ أَنَّا خَلَقْنَا لَهُم مِمَّا عَمِلَتْ أَيْدِينَآ أَنْعاماً فَهُمْ لَهَا مَالِكُونَ,Or have they not seen have they not realised the interrogative is meant as an affirmative and the wāw inserted therein in a-wa-lam is for supplementation that We have created for them and for all human beings of what Our hands worked of what We have made without any partner or helper cattle namely camels cows and sheep so that they are their owners? masters controlling them.
وَذَلَّلْنَاهَا لَهُمْ فَمِنْهَا رَكُوبُهُمْ وَمِنْهَا يَأْكُلُونَ,And We have subdued We have disposed these cattle for them so that some of them provide rides for them and some of them they eat.
وَلَهُمْ فِيهَا مَنَافِعُ وَمَشَارِبُ أَفَلاَ يَشْكُرُونَ,And there are other benefits for them therein such as their wool fur and hairs and drinks made from their milk mashārib is the plural of mashrab meaning shurb ‘a drink’; or what is meant is the place from which the drink issues. Will they not then give thanks? to the One Who has bestowed these graces upon them and so become believers? In other words they do not do any of this.
وَٱتَّخَذُواْ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ آلِهَةً لَّعَلَّهُمْ يُنصَرُونَ,And they have taken besides God in other words other than Him other gods idols which they worship that perhaps they might be helped protected against God’s chastisement by their gods’ interceding for them as they are wont to claim.
لاَ يَسْتَطِيعُونَ نَصْرَهُمْ وَهُمْ لَهُمْ جُندٌ مُّحْضَرُونَ,They their gods cannot help them — they are being treated as though they were rational beings — and they their idol gods are their host as they claim their supporters ever-present but in the Fire together with them.
فَلاَ يَحْزُنكَ قَوْلُهُمْ إِنَّا نَعْلَمُ مَا يُسِرُّونَ وَمَا يُعْلِنُونَ,So do not be grieved by their remarks to you that you have not been sent by God and otherwise. Assuredly We know what they conceal and what they proclaim in this respect and otherwise and We will requite them accordingly.
أَوَلَمْ يَرَ ٱلإِنسَانُ أَنَّا خَلَقْنَاهُ مِن نُّطْفَةٍ فَإِذَا هُوَ خَصِيمٌ مُّبِينٌ,Or has man — namely the like of al-‘Āsī b. Wā’il — not seen has he not realised that We created him from a drop of sperm and so on in stages until We made him powerful and strong. Then lo! he is an open adversary severely antagonistic towards Us openly making this manifest by his denial of resurrection.

It is reported that he al-‘Āsī took some withered bones and crushed them into pieces and said to the Prophet s ‘Do you think that God can revive these bones after they have decayed and become rot?’ And so the Prophet s said ‘Yes indeed! And He will also throw you into the Fire’.

فَٱنظُرْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَاقِبَةُ ٱلْمُنذَرِينَ,So behold how was the consequence for them who were warned namely the disbelievers in other words the sequel for them was that they ended up in the chastisement;

وَجَعَلْنَا ذُرِّيَّتَهُ هُمُ ٱلْبَاقِينَ,and made his descendants the survivors thus all human beings are descended from him peace be upon him. He had three sons Shem Sām the ancestor of the Arabs the Persians and the Byzantines; Ham Hām the ancestor of the Negroes; and Japheth Yāfith the ancestor of the Turks the Khazar and the peoples of Gog and Magog and the inhabitants of such regions.
وَتَرَكْنَا عَلَيْهِ فِي ٱلآخِرِينَ,And We left We preserved for him fair praise among posterity among the prophets and communities after him until the Day of Resurrection which is

In other words do you worship any other than God?
فَمَا ظَنُّكُم بِرَبِّ ٱلْعَالَمِينَ,What then is your supposition regarding the Lord of the Worlds?’ having worshipped other than Him do you think that He will leave you without punishment? No! They were a people of astrologers. On one occasion they went out to celebrate a festival of theirs and left their food behind with their idols claiming that they were securing thereby blessings for it and that they would eat it upon their return. They had said to the lord Abraham ‘Come out with us’.
فَنَظَرَ نَظْرَةً فِي ٱلنُّجُومِ,And he cast a glance at the stars — to delude them into thinking that he relies on them so that they would then trust him —
فَقَالَ إِنِّي سَقِيمٌ,and said ‘Indeed I feel I will be sick’ that is I will fall ill.
فَتَوَلَّوْاْ عَنْهُ مُدْبِرِينَ,So they went away to their festival leaving him behind.
فَرَاغَ إِلَىٰ آلِهَتِهِمْ فَقَالَ أَلا تَأْكُلُونَ,Then he turned he stole away to their gods the idols in front of which the food had been placed and said mockingly ‘Will you not eat? — but they failed to utter a word.
مَا لَكُمْ لاَ تَنطِقُونَ,He then said What is wrong with you that you do not speak?’ — but still he received no response.
فَرَاغَ عَلَيْهِمْ ضَرْباً بِٱلْيَمِينِ,He then turned on them striking them with his right hand with might smashing them. Those who saw him reported this to the rest of his people.
فَأَقْبَلُوۤاْ إِلَيْهِ يَزِفُّونَ,So they came running towards him walking hurriedly and they said to him ‘We worship them while you smash them?!’
قَالَ أَتَعْبُدُونَ مَا تَنْحِتُونَ,He said to them in reproach ‘Do you worship what you yourselves have carved out of stone and other materials idols
وَٱللَّهُ خَلَقَكُمْ وَمَا تَعْمَلُونَ,when God created you and whatever you make?’ whether it be your act of carving and that which you have carved? So worship Him alone! the mā in wa-mā ta‘malūna ‘and whatever you make’ is that of the verbal noun; but it is also said to introduce a relative clause or it is adjectivally qualified.
قَالُواْ ٱبْنُواْ لَهُ بُنْيَاناً فَأَلْقُوهُ فِي ٱلْجَحِيمِ,They said amongst themselves ‘Build for him a structure then fill it with firewood and set it on fire and when it is ablaze then cast him into the fierce fire’.
فَأَرَادُواْ بِهِ كَيْداً فَجَعَلْنَاهُمُ ٱلأَسْفَلِينَ,So they sought to outwit him by flinging him into the fire so that it may destroy him but We made them the lowermost the vanquished as he came out of the fire unharmed.
وَقَالَ إِنِّي ذَاهِبٌ إِلَىٰ رَبِّي سَيَهْدِينِ,And he said ‘I shall indeed depart to my Lord I shall emigrating to Him from the abode of disbelief — He will guide me to the place to which My Lord has commanded that I end up in and this was Syria. When he reached the Holy Land he said
رَبِّ هَبْ لِي مِنَ ٱلصَّالِحِينَ,My Lord! Grant me a child of the righteous’.
فَبَشَّرْنَاهُ بِغُلاَمٍ حَلِيمٍ,So We gave him the good tidings of a forbearing son.
فَلَمَّا بَلَغَ مَعَهُ ٱلسَّعْيَ قَالَ يٰبُنَيَّ إِنِّيۤ أَرَىٰ فِي ٱلْمَنَامِ أَنِّي أَذْبَحُكَ فَٱنظُرْ مَاذَا تَرَىٰ قَالَ يٰأَبَتِ ٱفْعَلْ مَا تُؤمَرُ سَتَجِدُنِيۤ إِن شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ مِنَ ٱلصَّابِرِينَ,And when he was old enough to walk with him that is to go about with him and help him out — this is said to have been either at the age of seven or at the age of thirteen — he said ‘O my dear son I see that is I have seen in a dream that I shall sacrifice you — and the visions of prophets are always true and their actions are inspired by the command of God exalted be He. So see what you think’ of this dream. He consulted him so that he his son might accept the idea of being sacrificed and comply with the command for it. He said ‘O my father the final tā’ in abati replaces the yā’ of the genitive possessive annexation yā abī do whatever you have been commanded to do. You shall find me God willing of the steadfast’ in this affair.
فَلَمَّا أَسْلَمَا وَتَلَّهُ لِلْجَبِينِ,And when they had both submitted when they had submitted to and were prepared to comply with God’s command exalted be He and he had laid him down on his forehead when he had pushed him down to the ground thereon — every human being has two brows jabīn between which is the forehead jabha; this was at Minā. Abraham passed the knife across his son’s throat but it did not do anything by some impediment of the Divine Power
وَنَادَيْنَاهُ أَن يٰإِبْرَاهِيمُ,We called to him ‘O Abraham!
قَدْ صَدَّقْتَ ٱلرُّؤْيَآ إِنَّا كَذَلِكَ نَجْزِي ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,Verily you have fulfilled the vision’ by what you have done in that you were able to go through with the act of sacrifice. In other words that which you have done suffices for you as redemption the statement nādaynāhu ‘We called to him’ is the response to the lammā ‘when’ so that the wāw in wa-nādaynāhu ‘We called to him’ is extra. So in the same way that We have rewarded you do We reward those who are virtuous to their own souls in obeying the Command of God by removing from them their distress.
إِنَّ هَـٰذَا لَهُوَ ٱلْبَلاَءُ ٱلْمُبِينُ,Truly this sacrifice to which he was commanded was indeed a clear test’ that is to say the ultimate test of faith.
وَفَدَيْنَاهُ بِذِبْحٍ عَظِيمٍ,Then We ransomed him the one whom he had been commanded to sacrifice namely Ishmael or Isaac — two different opinions — with a mighty sacrifice a mighty ram from Paradise the same one that Abel had offered as as sacrifice Gabriel peace be upon him brought it and the lord Abraham sacrificed it as he cried Allāhu akbar ‘God is Great’.
وَتَرَكْنَا عَلَيْهِ فِي ٱلآخِرِينَ,And We left We preserved for him among posterity fair praise namely
سَلاَمٌ عَلَىٰ إِبْرَاهِيمَ,‘Peace from Us be to Abraham!’
كَذَلِكَ نَجْزِي ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,So in way that We rewarded him do We reward those who are virtuous to their own souls.
إِنَّهُ مِنْ عِبَادِنَا ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,Indeed he is one of Our faithful servants.
وَبَشَّرْنَاهُ بِإِسْحَاقَ نَبِيّاً مِّنَ ٱلصَّالِحِينَ,And We gave him the good tidings of the birth of Isaac — some have argued that this proves that the one who was sacrificed was not him Isaac — a prophet nabiyyan is a future circumstantial qualifier that is to say ‘he will come to be with his prophethood decreed one of the righteous.
وَبَارَكْنَا عَلَيْهِ وَعَلَىٰ إِسْحَاقَ وَمِن ذُرِّيَّتِهِمَا مُحْسِنٌ وَظَالِمٌ لِّنَفْسِهِ مُبِينٌ,And We blessed him by multiplying his descendants and Isaac his son We also blessed by appointing the majority of prophets from among his progeny. And among their descendants is he who is virtuous he who is a believer and he who plainly wrongs his soul he who is a disbeliever whose disbelief is manifest.
وَلَقَدْ مَنَنَّا عَلَىٰ مُوسَىٰ وَهَارُونَ,And verily We favoured Moses and Aaron with prophethood
وَنَجَّيْنَاهُمَا وَقَوْمَهُمَا مِنَ ٱلْكَرْبِ ٱلْعَظِيمِ,and We delivered them and their people the Children of Israel from the great distress namely Pharaoh’s enslavement of them.
وَنَصَرْنَاهُمْ فَكَانُواْ هُمُ ٱلْغَٰلِبِينَ,And We helped them against the Egyptians so that they became the victors.
وَآتَيْنَاهُمَا ٱلْكِتَابَ ٱلْمُسْتَبِينَ,And We gave them the enlightening scripture the one whose statements concerning prescribed punishments and rulings and otherwise are excellently expressed — this is the Torah.
وَهَدَيْنَاهُمَا ٱلصِّرَاطَ ٱلْمُسْتَقِيمَ,And We guided them to the straight path the straight way
وَتَرَكْنَا عَلَيْهِمَا فِي ٱلآخِرِينَ,and We left We preserved for them among posterity fair praise namely
سَلاَمٌ عَلَىٰ مُوسَىٰ وَهَارُونَ,‘Peace from Us be to Moses and Aaron!’
إِنَّا كَذَلِكَ نَجْزِي ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,So just as We rewarded them both do We reward the virtuous.
إِنَّهُمَا مِنْ عِبَادِنَا ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,Indeed both were among Our faithful servants.
وَإِنَّ إِلْيَاسَ لَمِنَ ٱلْمُرْسَلِينَ,And truly Elias read wa-inna Ilyās with the initial hamza or without wa-inna’l-yāsa was also one of the messengers. Some think that this Elias was the son of Aaron’s brother — Aaron the brother of Moses; but some say that this Elias was some other person who was sent to the people living in and around Baalbak.
إِذْ قَالَ لِقَوْمِهِ أَلاَ تَتَّقُونَ,When idh is dependent because of an implicit verb udhkur ‘mention’ he said to his people ‘Will you not fear God?
أَتَدْعُونَ بَعْلاً وَتَذَرُونَ أَحْسَنَ ٱلْخَالِقِينَ,Do you call on Baal — this was the name of an idol of theirs which was made of gold from which the name of their city derives with the addition of the suffix bak — that is to say do you worship him and abandon the Best of Creators and not worship Him
ٱللَّهَ رَبَّكُمْ وَرَبَّ آبَآئِكُمُ ٱلأَوَّلِينَ,God your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers?’ read as predicates allāhu rabbukum and rabbu in the nominative because of the implicit omitted huwa being the subject; or read allāha rabbakum and rabba in the accusative as supplements to ahsana ‘the best of’.
فَكَذَّبُوهُ فَإِنَّهُمْ لَمُحْضَرُونَ,But they denied him. So they will indeed be arraigned in the Fire
إِلاَّ عِبَادَ ٱللَّهِ ٱلْمُخْلَصِينَ,— all except God’s delivered servants namely the believers who will be saved from it
وَتَرَكْنَا عَلَيْهِ فِي ٱلآخِرِينَ,and We left for him among posterity fair praise namely
سَلاَمٌ عَلَىٰ إِلْ يَاسِينَ,‘Peace from Us be to Elias!’. It is said that this ilyāsīn is the same Elias mentioned above; but it is also said that this denotes him together with all those who were believers with him and so they have been coupled under the same term with him being the predominant as when one might say al-Muhallabūn ‘the Muhallabids’ to mean al-Muhallab and his folk; a variant reading has āl yāsīn by which is meant his family as well as Elias himself.
إِنَّا كَذَلِكَ نَجْزِي ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,Indeed so — just as We rewarded him — do We reward the virtuous.
إِنَّهُ مِنْ عِبَادِنَا ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,Truly he is one of Our faithful servants.
وَإِنَّ لُوطاً لَّمِنَ ٱلْمُرْسَلِينَ,And indeed Lot was one of the messengers;
إِذْ نَجَّيْنَاهُ وَأَهْلَهُ أَجْمَعِينَ,mention when We delivered him together with all his family
إِلاَّ عَجُوزاً فِي ٱلْغَابِرِينَ,except an old woman who was among those who stayed behind in other words those who stayed behind in the chastisement.
ثُمَّ دَمَّرْنَا ٱلآخَرِينَ,Then We destroyed all the others the disbelievers from among his people.
وَإِنَّكُمْ لَّتَمُرُّونَ عَلَيْهِمْ مُّصْبِحِينَ,And indeed you pass by them by their remains and the remains of their dwellings during your travels both in the morning that is during the daytime
وَبِٱلَّيلِ أَفَلاَ تَعْقِلُونَ,and at night will you O people of Mecca not then understand? what befell them and so take heed therefrom?
وَإِنَّ يُونُسَ لَمِنَ ٱلْمُرْسَلِينَ,And indeed Jonah was one of the messengers;
إِذْ أَبَقَ إِلَى ٱلْفُلْكِ ٱلْمَشْحُونِ,when he fled to the laden ship — after he became furious with his people as the chastisement which he had promised them did not come down on them; so he boarded the ship which then stopped out in the deep sea. The seamen said ‘There is a runaway slave here upon this ship who has fled from his master a casting of lots should expose him!’
فَسَاهَمَ فَكَانَ مِنَ ٱلْمُدْحَضِينَ,Then he drew lots with the passengers on the ship and was of those rejected of the losers in the draw and so they threw him into the sea.
فَٱلْتَقَمَهُ ٱلْحُوتُ وَهُوَ مُلِيمٌ,Then the whale swallowed him while he was blameworthy that is while he was guilty of a blameworthy thing having gone to sea and embarked the ship without his Lord’s permission.
فَلَوْلاَ أَنَّهُ كَانَ مِنَ ٱلْمُسَبِّحِينَ,And had he not been one of those who glorify God that is to say those who make remembrance of God for inside the whale’s belly he was repeatedly saying the words ‘There is no god except You. Glory be to You! I have indeed been one of the wrongdoers’ Q. 2187
لَلَبِثَ فِي بَطْنِهِ إِلَىٰ يَوْمِ يُبْعَثُونَ,he would have tarried in its belly until the day when they are raised in other words the whale’s belly would have been his tomb until the Day of Resurrection.
فَنَبَذْنَاهُ بِٱلْعَرَآءِ وَهُوَ سَقِيمٌ,Then We cast him We flung him out of the belly of the whale onto the barren land onto the face of the earth that is onto the shore on that same day — or three or seven or twenty or forty days later — and he was sick ailing like a newly-born featherless chick.
وَأَنبَتْنَا عَلَيْهِ شَجَرَةً مِّن يَقْطِينٍ,And We made a gourd plant to grow above him to provide shade for him with its stem which is not the case usually with gourds as a miracle for him; a mountain goat would come to him in the morning and in the evening and he would drink its milk until he finally regained his strength.
وَأَرْسَلْنَاهُ إِلَىٰ مِئَةِ أَلْفٍ أَوْ يَزِيدُونَ,And We sent him afterwards — as We had done before to a people in Nineveh in the region of Mosul — to a community of a hundred thousand or in fact more — a community of twenty thirty or seventy thousand.
فَآمَنُواْ فَمَتَّعْنَاهُمْ إِلَىٰ حِينٍ,And they believed after they saw with their own eyes the chastisement which they had been promised. So We gave them comfort We kept them alive to enjoy their wealth for a while until their terms of life would be concluded while they took comfort therein.
فَٱسْتَفْتِهِمْ أَلِرَبِّكَ ٱلْبَنَاتُ وَلَهُمُ ٱلْبَنُونَ,So ask them inquire of the Meccan disbelievers by way of reproach are daughters to be for your Lord after their claim that the angels were God’s daughters while sons are to be for them? so that the best becomes exclusively theirs?
أَمْ خَلَقْنَا ٱلْمَلاَئِكَةَ إِنَاثاً وَهُمْ شَاهِدُونَ,Or did We create the angels females while they were witnesses? to Our act of creation that they might then say such a thing?
أَلاَ إِنَّهُم مِّنْ إِفْكِهِمْ لَيَقُولُونَ,Lo! it is indeed out of their own mendacity their own lies that they say
وَلَدَ ٱللَّهُ وَإِنَّهُمْ لَكَاذِبُونَ,‘God has begotten’ when they say that the angels are God’s daughters. And verily they are liars in this respect.
أَصْطَفَى ٱلْبَنَاتِ عَلَىٰ ٱلْبَنِينَ,Has He preferred daughters to sons? read a’stafā ‘has He preferred’ indicating an interrogative hamza which stands in place of the omitted conjunctive hamza.
مَا لَكُمْ كَيْفَ تَحْكُمُونَ,What is wrong with you? How do you judge? how do you make such a depraved judgement?
أَفَلاَ تَذَكَّرُونَ,Will you not then remember? tadhakkarūna the tā’ of tatadhakkarūna has been assimilated with the dhāl that He glory be to Him is exalted above having a child?
أَمْ لَكُمْ سُلْطَانٌ مُّبِينٌ,Or do you have a clear warrant? plain definitive proof that God has a child?
فَأْتُواْ بِكِتَابِكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ صَادِقِينَ,Then produce your scripture the Torah and show Me this as it is mentioned in it if you are being truthful about this statement of yours.
وَجَعَلُواْ بَيْنَهُ وَبَيْنَ ٱلْجِنَّةِ نَسَباً وَلَقَدْ عَلِمَتِ ٱلجِنَّةُ إِنَّهُمْ لَمُحْضَرُونَ,And they namely the idolaters have set up between Him exalted be He and the jinn namely the angels jinna they are so called because they are hidden ijtinān from vision a kinship by saying that they are God’s daughters while the jinn certainly know that they that is those who say this shall indeed be arraigned into the Fire to be chastised therein.
سُبْحَانَ ٱللَّهِ عَمَّا يَصِفُونَ,Glory be to God affirming that He is exalted above what they attribute to Him in the way of His having a child
إِلاَّ عِبَادَ ٱللَّهِ ٱلْمُخْلَصِينَ,— all except God’s devoted servants namely believers the exceptive clause here is discontinuous in other words that is because they declare that God transcends what such individuals attribute to Him.
فَإِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ,For indeed you and what you worship of idols
مَآ أَنتُمْ عَلَيْهِ بِفَاتِنِينَ,— you cannot tempt anyone thereto that is to incline to your worshipped idols ‘alayhi ‘thereto’ is semantically connected to His saying bi-fātinīna ‘you cannot tempt’
إِلاَّ مَنْ هُوَ صَالِ ٱلْجَحِيمِ,except him who will burn in Hell in God’s knowledge exalted be He.
وَمَا مِنَّآ إِلاَّ لَهُ مَقَامٌ مَّعْلُومٌ,Gabriel said to the Prophet s And there is not one of us us the company of angels but has a known station in the heavens in which he worships God and which he does not transgress.
وَإِنَّا لَنَحْنُ ٱلصَّآفُّونَ,And indeed it is we who are the rangers of our feet in prayer.
وَإِنَّا لَنَحْنُ ٱلْمُسَبِّحُونَ,And indeed it is we who give glory it is we who declare that God transcends what does not befit Him.
وَإِن كَانُواْ لَيَقُولُونَ,And indeed in is softened in place of the hardened one they the Meccan disbelievers used to say
لَوْ أَنَّ عِندَنَا ذِكْراً مِّنَ ٱلأَوَّلِينَ,‘If we had but a reminder a scripture from the ancients that is from among the scriptures of past communities
لَكُنَّا عِبَادَ ٱللَّهِ ٱلْمُخْلَصِينَ,we would have surely been God’s devoted servants’ devoting worship purely to Him.
فَكَفَرُواْ بِهِ فَسَوْفَ يَعْلَمُونَ,God exalted be He says Yet they disbelieved in it in other words in the Book that came to them namely the Qur’ān more glorious than all those other scriptures; but they will come to know the consequences of their disbelief.
وَلَقَدْ سَبَقَتْ كَلِمَتُنَا لِعِبَادِنَا ٱلْمُرْسَلِينَ,And verily Our Word containing the promise of victory has gone beforehand in favour of Our servants the messengers and that Word is I shall assuredly prevail I and My messengers Q. 5821 —
إِنَّهُمْ لَهُمُ ٱلْمَنصُورُونَ,or it is His following saying — assuredly they shall be helped
وَإِنَّ جُندَنَا لَهُمُ ٱلْغَالِبُونَ,and assuredly Our hosts namely the believers they will indeed be the victors over the disbelievers by their being given the definitive proofs and assistance against them in this world. And if some of these believers are not victorious over them in this world then assuredly in the Hereafter they will be so.
فَتَوَلَّ عَنْهُمْ حَتَّىٰ حِينٍ,So leave them in other words shun the Meccan disbelievers for a while until such time as you are commanded to fight them;
وَأَبْصِرْهُمْ فَسَوْفَ يُبْصِرُونَ,and watch them when the chastisement is sent down on them; for they will soon see the consequences of their disbelief.
أَفَبِعَذَابِنَا يَسْتَعْجِلُونَ,They then said in mockery ‘When will this chastisement be sent down?’ God exalted be He threatens them by saying Do they seek to hasten Our chastisement?
فَإِذَا نَزَلَ بِسَاحَتِهِمْ فَسَآءَ صَبَاحُ ٱلْمُنْذَرِينَ,But when it descends in their courtyard — al-Farrā’ said that the Arabs find it sufficient to refer to a people by referring to ‘their courtyard’ — how awful how terrible a morning will be the morning for those who were warned the overt noun al-mundharīn has replaced the third person pronominalisation in sāhatihim.
وَتَوَلَّ عَنْهُمْ حَتَّىٰ حِينٍ,So leave them for a while
وَأَبْصِرْ فَسَوْفَ يُبْصِرُونَ,and watch; for they will soon see — this statement is repeated in order to emphasise the threat made to them and to reassure the Prophet s.
سُبْحَانَ رَبِّكَ رَبِّ ٱلْعِزَّةِ عَمَّا يَصِفُونَ,Glory be to your Lord the Lord of Might of Triumph exalted is He above what they allege! in the way of His having a child.
وَسَلاَمٌ عَلَىٰ ٱلْمُرْسَلِينَ,And peace be to the messengers who convey from God the Message of the Oneness of God and His Laws.
وَٱلْحَمْدُ للَّهِ رَبِّ ٱلْعَالَمِينَ,And praise be to God Lord of the Worlds for granting these messengers victory and destroying the disbelievers.
صۤ وَٱلْقُرْآنِ ذِي ٱلذِّكْرِ,Sād God knows best what He means by this letter. By the Qur’ān bearing the Remembrance that is bearing the Pronouncement; or what is meant is that the Qur’ān is a Book of renown the response to this oath has been omitted in other words ‘It is not as the Meccan disbelievers say that there are many gods’.
بَلِ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ فِي عِزَّةٍ وَشِقَاقٍ,Nay but those who disbelieve from among the people of Mecca dwell in conceit in self-glory and in disdain of faith and defiance disagreement with and enmity towards the Prophet s.
كَمْ أَهْلَكْنَا مِن قَبْلِهِم مِّن قَرْنٍ فَنَادَواْ وَّلاَتَ حِينَ مَنَاصٍ,How many — in other words many — a generation a community of past communities We have destroyed before them and they cried out when the chastisement was sent down on them when it was no longer the time for escape that is to say the time was not one for fleeing the suffixed tā’ of wa-lāta is extra; the sentence is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the subject of the verb nādaw ‘they cried out’ in other words they called for help but the situation was such that there could be no escape or deliverance; but still the Meccan disbelievers have not taken heed from their example.
وَعَجِبُوۤاْ أَن جَآءَهُم مٌّنذِرٌ مِّنْهُمْ وَقَالَ ٱلْكَافِرُونَ هَـٰذَا سَاحِرٌ كَذَّابٌ,And they marvel that a warner has come to them from among themselves a messenger from among their number to warn them and to threaten them with the punishment of the Fire after resurrection — and this warner is the Prophet s. And those who disbelieve the overt noun al-kāfirūnā has replaced the third person pronominalisation say ‘This is a sorcerer a liar.
أَجَعَلَ ٱلآلِهَةَ إِلَـٰهاً وَاحِداً إِنَّ هَـٰذَا لَشَيْءٌ عُجَابٌ,Has he made the gods One God? — for he had said to them ‘Say there is no god except God’ — in other words they objected how could one god suffice for all of creation? Lo! that is indeed a curious thing’.
وَٱنطَلَقَ ٱلْمَلأُ مِنْهُمْ أَنِ ٱمْشُواْ وَاْصْبِرُواْ عَلَىٰ آلِهَتِكُمْ إِنَّ هَـٰذَا لَشَيْءٌ يُرَادُ,And the council from among them go about from the place of their assembly at the house of Abū Tālib and the place where they heard the Prophet s say ‘Say there is no god except God’ saying ‘Go! they say to one another go and stand by your gods adhere firmly to worship of them; lo! this that has been mentioned concerning the Oneness of God is indeed a thing sought from us.
مَا سَمِعْنَا بِهَـٰذَا فِى ٱلْمِلَّةِ ٱلآخِرَةِ إِنْ هَـٰذَا إِلاَّ ٱخْتِلاَقٌ,We never heard of this in the latter-day creed namely the creed of Jesus. This is surely nothing but an invention mere lies.
أَءُنزِلَ عَلَيْهِ ٱلذِّكْرُ مِن بَيْنِنَا بَلْ هُمْ فَي شَكٍّ مِّن ذِكْرِي بَل لَّمَّا يَذُوقُواْ عَذَابِ,Has the Remembrance the Qur’ān been revealed to him Muhammad (s) out of all of us’ when he is neither the elder nor the noblest among us? In other words it could not have been revealed to him read a-unzila pronouncing both hamzas or not pronouncing the second one but in both cases inserting an intervening alif or without this insertion. God exalted be He says Nay but they are in doubt concerning My Remembrance My revelation that is the Qur’ān for they deny the one who has brought it. Nay but they have not yet tasted My chastisement and if they were to taste it they would certainly believe the Prophet s in what he has brought — but then in such a case their belief in the Prophet would be of no benefit to them.
أَمْ عِندَهُمْ خَزَآئِنُ رَحْمَةِ رَبِّكَ ٱلْعَزِيزِ ٱلْوَهَّابِ,Or do they possess the treasuries of your Lord’s mercy the Mighty the Victor the Bestower? treasuries such as prophethood and otherwise so that they might give it to whomever they want?
أَمْ لَهُم مُّلْكُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا فَلْيَرْتَقُواْ فِى ٱلأَسْبَابِ,Or do they possess the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them? If this is what they claim Then let them ascend by the means of ascension that lead to the heaven and bring down some revelation wahy and then assign it exclusively to whomever they wish am in both verses represents the rhetorical hamza of denial.
جُندٌ مَّا هُنَالِكَ مَهْزُومٌ مِّن ٱلأَحَزَابِ,A routed mahzūmun is an adjectival qualification of jundun ‘host’ host is all that they are in other words they are nothing but a despicable host nothing more — in their denial of you — from among the factions mina’l-ahzābi also an adjectival qualification of jundun in other words they are like those hosts of factions who were in confederation against prophets before you these were defeated and destroyed and likewise We shall destroy these people.
كَذَّبَتْ قَبْلَهُمْ قَوْمُ نُوحٍ وَعَادٌ وفِرْعَوْنُ ذُو ٱلأَوْتَادِ,Before them the people of Noah denied the inflection of the verb kadhdabat ‘denied’ that is governed by qawmu ‘people’ is in the feminine person because of the implicit sense and so did those of ‘Ād and Pharaoh he of the stakes — he used to fix four stakes for the person who incurred his wrath and tie to these stakes that person’s hands and feet and then torture him —
وَثَمُودُ وَقَوْمُ لُوطٍ وَأَصْحَابُ لْئَيْكَةِ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ ٱلأَحْزَابُ,and Thamūd and the people of Lot and the dwellers in the wood a small forest namely the people of Shu‘ayb peace be upon him — those were the factions.
إِن كُلٌّ إِلاَّ كَذَّبَ ٱلرُّسُلَ فَحَقَّ عِقَابِ,Each one of the factions did not but deny the messengers for when they deny one they have in effect denied them all since their call to God is the same one namely the call to affirmation of His Oneness. So My retribution was justified it was necessary.
وَمَا يَنظُرُ هَـٰؤُلآءِ إِلاَّ صَيْحَةً واحِدَةً مَّا لَهَا مِن فَوَاقٍ,And these that is the disbelievers of Mecca do not await but a single Cry namely the Blast of the Resurrection that will herald chastisement for them for which there will be no revoking read fawāq or fuwāq.
وَقَالُواْ رَبَّنَا عَجِّل لَّنَا قِطَّنَا قَبْلَ يَوْمِ ٱلْحِسَابِ,And they said — after the following verse was revealed As for him who is given his book in his right hand … to the end of the verse Q. 6919 — ‘Our Lord hasten on for us the record of our deeds before the Day of Reckoning’ — they said this mockingly.
ٱصْبِر عَلَىٰ مَا يَقُولُونَ وَٱذْكُرْ عَبْدَنَا دَاوُودَ ذَا ٱلأَيْدِ إِنَّهُ أَوَّابٌ,God exalted be He says Bear patiently what they say and remember Our servant David the one of fortitude that is to say the one of fortitude in worship he used to fast every other day and keep vigil for half the night sleep for a third and then keep vigil for the last sixth. Indeed he was a penitent soul always returning to what pleases God.
إِنَّا سَخَّرْنَا ٱلجِبَالَ مَعَهُ يُسَبِّحْنَ بِٱلْعَشِيِّ وَٱلإِشْرَاقِ,Truly We disposed the mountains to glorify God with him with the same glorification at evening at the time of the night prayer and at sunrise at the time of the morning prayer which is when the sun has fully risen with its light extending everywhere.
وَٱلطَّيْرَ مَحْشُورَةً كُلٌّ لَّهُ أَوَّابٌ,And We disposed the birds mustered in flocks gathered before him glorifying with him; each of the mountains and birds turning to him reverting to obedience of him by glorifying God with him.
وَشَدَدْنَا مُلْكَهُ وَآتَيْنَاهُ ٱلْحِكْمَةَ وَفَصْلَ ٱلْخِطَابِ,And We strengthened his Kingdom We reinforced it with guards and hosts every night there thirty thousand men would be standing guard at his sanctuary; and gave him wisdom prophethood and sound judgement in all matters and decisive speech the ability to formulate a satisfactory statement for a decision in any endeavour.
وَهَلْ أَتَاكَ نَبَؤُاْ ٱلْخَصْمِ إِذْ تَسَوَّرُواْ ٱلْمِحْرَابَ,And has there come to you O Muhammad (s) the purpose of the interrogative indicated by hal here is to provoke curiosity and a desire to listen to what will follow the tale of the disputants when they scaled the sanctuary? David’s sanctuary that is his place of prayer for they had been prohibited from entering by the front gates because of his being engaged in worship in other words has it come to you their tale and their account?
إِذْ دَخَلُواْ عَلَىٰ دَاوُودَ فَفَزِعَ مِنْهُمْ قَالُواْ لاَ تَخَفْ خَصْمَانِ بَغَىٰ بَعْضُنَا عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ فَٱحْكُمْ بَيْنَنَا بِٱلْحَقِّ وَلاَ تُشْطِطْ وَٱهْدِنَآ إِلَىٰ سَوَآءِ ٱلصِّرَاطِ,When they entered upon David and he was frightened by them. And they said ‘Do not fear; we are two disputants some say that this means ‘two groups’ in order to agree with the plural person of the verb dakhalū ‘they entered’; others say ‘two individuals’ with the plural person actually denoting these two; al-khasm may refer to a one or more individuals. These two were angels who had come in the form of two disputants between whom there was supposed to have occurred the situation mentioned — but only hypothetically — in order to alert David peace be upon him to what he had done he had ninety nine women but desired the woman of a man who had only her and no other. He David had married her and consummated the marriage. One of us has infringed upon the rights of the other so judge justly between us and do not transgress do not be unjust and guide us direct us to the right path’ the correct way.
إِنَّ هَذَآ أَخِي لَهُ تِسْعٌ وَتِسْعُونَ نَعْجَةً وَلِي نَعْجَةٌ وَاحِدَةٌ فَقَالَ أَكْفِلْنِيهَا وَعَزَّنِي فِي ٱلْخِطَابِ,‘Behold this brother of mine in other words my fellow co-religionist has ninety-nine ewes — here used to represent the women — while I have a single ewe; yet he said “Entrust it to me” in other words make me in charge of it and he overcame me in speech’ in other words in the argument; so the latter conceded charge of it to him.
قَالَ لَقَدْ ظَلَمَكَ بِسُؤَالِ نَعْجَتِكَ إِلَىٰ نِعَاجِهِ وَإِنَّ كَثِيراً مِّنَ ٱلْخُلَطَآءِ لَيَبْغِيۤ بَعْضُهُمْ عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ إِلاَّ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ وَقَلِيلٌ مَّا هُمْ وَظَنَّ دَاوُودُ أَنَّمَا فَتَنَّاهُ فَٱسْتَغْفَرَ رَبَّهُ وَخَرَّ رَاكِعاً وَأَنَابَ,He said ‘He has certainly wronged you by asking for your ewe that he may add it to his sheep. And indeed many associates infringe upon the rights of one another except such as believe and perform righteous deeds but few are they!’ mā emphasises the ‘fewness’. As the two angels were ascending to the heaven one said to the other ‘He has certainly passed judgement on himself!’ David was thus alerted to his deed. God exalted be He says And David thought in other words he became certain that We had indeed tried him that We had caused him to fall into a trial that is a test through his love for that woman. So he sought forgiveness of his Lord and fell down bowing in other words prostrate and repented.
فَغَفَرْنَا لَهُ ذَلِكَ وَإِنَّ لَهُ عِندَنَا لَزُلْفَىٰ وَحُسْنَ مَـآبٍ,So We forgave him that and indeed he has a station of nearness with Us that is even more good things in this world and a fair return in the Hereafter.
يٰدَاوُودُ إِنَّا جَعَلْنَاكَ خَلِيفَةً فِي ٱلأَرْضِ فَٱحْكُمْ بَيْنَ ٱلنَّاسِ بِٱلْحَقِّ وَلاَ تَتَّبِعِ ٱلْهَوَىٰ فَيُضِلَّكَ عَن سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يَضِلُّونَ عَن سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ شَدِيدُ بِمَا نَسُواْ يَوْمَ ٱلْحِسَابِ,‘O David! We have indeed made you a vicegerent on the earth managing the affairs of people; so judge justly between people and do not follow desire that is the desires of the soul that it then lead you astray from the way of God that is to say from the proofs that indicate the truth of His Oneness. Truly those who go astray from the way of God in other words from belief in God — for them there will be a severe chastisement because of their forgetting the Day of Reckoning’ as a result of their having neglected faith. For had they been certain of the truth of the Day of Reckoning they would have first been believers in this world.
وَمَا خَلَقْنَا ٱلسَّمَآءَ وَٱلأَرْضَ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا بَاطِلاً ذَلِكَ ظَنُّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ فَوَيْلٌ لِّلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِنَ ٱلنَّارِ,And We did not create the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in vain frivolously. That namely the creation of what has been mentioned as being for no particular purpose is the supposition of those who disbelieve from among the people of Mecca. So woe — a valley in hell-fire — to the disbelievers from the Fire!
أَمْ نَجْعَلُ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ كَٱلْمُفْسِدِينَ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ أَمْ نَجْعَلُ ٱلْمُتَّقِينَ كَٱلْفُجَّارِ,Or shall We treat those who believe and perform righteous deeds like those who cause corruption in the earth; or shall We treat the God-fearing like the profligate? This was revealed when the Meccan disbelievers said to the believers ‘In the Hereafter we will receive the same reward as that which you will receive’ am ‘or’ contains the rhetorical hamza of denial.
كِتَابٌ أَنزَلْنَاهُ إِلَيْكَ مُبَارَكٌ لِّيَدَّبَّرُوۤاْ آيَاتِهِ وَلِيَتَذَكَّرَ أُوْلُواْ ٱلأَلْبَابِ,A Book kitābun the predicate of a missing subject namely hādhā ‘this is’ that We have revealed to you full of blessing that they may contemplate yaddabbarū is actually yatadabbarū but the tā’ has been assimilated with the dāl its signs that they may reflect upon its meanings and become believers and that they may remember that they may be admonished — those people of pith those possessors of intellect.
وَوَهَبْنَا لِدَاوُودَ سُلَيْمَانَ نِعْمَ ٱلْعَبْدُ إِنَّهُ أَوَّابٌ,And We bestowed on David Solomon his son — what an excellent servant! that is Solomon. Truly he was a penitent soul always returning to God with glorification and remembrance at all times.
إِذْ عُرِضَ عَلَيْهِ بِٱلْعَشِيِّ ٱلصَّافِنَاتُ ٱلْجِيَادُ,When one evening — which is the period after midday — there were displayed before him the prancing steeds al-sāfināt ‘horses’ is the plural of sāfina which denotes a horse standing on three legs with the fourth supported on the edge of the hoof and derives from the verb safana yasfinu sufūnan; al-jiyād is the plural of jawād which is a ‘racer’; the meaning is that these horses are such that when they are halted they stand still and when they run they surpass others in speed. One thousand horses were displayed before him after he had performed the midday prayer for he had wanted to use them in a holy struggle jihād against an enemy. But when the display reached the nine-hundredth horse the sun set and he had not performed the afternoon prayer. So he was greatly distressed.
فَقَالَ إِنِّيۤ أَحْبَبْتُ حُبَّ ٱلْخَيْرِ عَن ذِكْرِ رَبِّي حَتَّىٰ تَوَارَتْ بِٱلْحِجَابِ,He said ‘Lo! I have loved I have desired the love of worldly good things that is of horses over the remembrance of my Lord’ that is over the afternoon prayer until it that is the sun disappeared behind the night’s veil until it was concealed by that which veils it from sight.
رُدُّوهَا عَلَيَّ فَطَفِقَ مَسْحاً بِٱلسُّوقِ وَٱلأَعْنَاقِ,Bring them back to me! that is the horses that were displayed; and they so brought them back. Then he set about slashing with his sword their legs al-sūq is the plural of sāq and necks in other words he slaughtered them and cut off their legs as an offering of atonement to God exalted be He for having been distracted by them from the prayer. He gave all the meat thereof as voluntary alms and so God compensated him what was better and faster that these horses and this was the wind which blew at his command as he wished.
وَلَقَدْ فَتَنَّا سُلَيْمَانَ وَأَلْقَيْنَا عَلَىٰ كُرْسِيِّهِ جَسَداً ثُمَّ أَنَابَ,And We certainly tried Solomon We tested him by wresting his kingdom from him because he had married a woman solely out of his desire for her. She used to worship idols in his own home without his knowledge. Now control of his kingdom lay in his ring. On one occasion needing to withdraw to relieve himself he took it off and left it with this woman of his whose name was al-Amīna as was his custom; but a jinn disguised in the form of Solomon came to her and seized it from her. And We cast upon his throne a lifeless body which was that very jinn and he was the one known as Sakhr — or it was some other jinn; he sat upon Solomon’s throne and so as was the case with Solomon the birds and other creatures devoted themselves to him in service. When Solomon came out of his palace having seen him the jinn upon his throne he said to the people ‘I am Solomon not him!’ But they did not recognise him. Then he repented — Solomon returned to his kingdom many days later after he had managed to acquire the ring. He wore it and sat upon his throne again.
قَالَ رَبِّ ٱغْفِرْ لِي وَهَبْ لِي مُلْكاً لاَّ يَنبَغِي لأَحَدٍ مِّن بَعْدِيۤ إِنَّكَ أَنتَ ٱلْوَهَّابُ,He said ‘My Lord! Forgive me and grant me a kingdom that shall not belong to anyone after me in other words other than me this use of min ba‘dī to mean ‘other than me’ is similar to Q. 4523 fa-man yahdīh min ba‘di’Llāh ‘who will guide him other than God?’. Truly You are the Bestower’.
فَسَخَّرْنَا لَهُ ٱلرِّيحَ تَجْرِي بِأَمْرِهِ رُخَآءً حَيْثُ أَصَابَ,So We disposed for him the wind which blew softly gently at his command wherever he intended.
وَٱلشَّيَاطِينَ كُلَّ بَنَّآءٍ وَغَوَّاصٍ,And the devils also We disposed every builder building marvellous edifices and diver in the sea bringing up pearls
وَآخَرِينَ مُقَرَّنِينَ فِي ٱلأَصْفَادِ,and others too from among them bounded together in fetters in shackles with their hands tied to their necks.
هَـٰذَا عَطَآؤُنَا فَٱمْنُنْ أَوْ أَمْسِكْ بِغَيْرِ حِسَابٍ,And We said to him ‘This is Our gift. So bestow grant thereof to whomever you wish or withhold from giving without any reckoning’ in other words without your being called to account for any of this.
وَإِنَّ لَهُ عِندَنَا لَزُلْفَىٰ وَحُسْنَ مَآبٍ,And indeed he has a station of nearness with Us and a fair resort — a similar statement has already appeared in another verse above.
وَٱذْكُرْ عَبْدَنَآ أَيُّوبَ إِذْ نَادَىٰ رَبَّهُ أَنِّي مَسَّنِيَ ٱلشَّيْطَانُ بِنُصْبٍ وَعَذَابٍ,And mention also Our servant Job when he called out to his Lord saying ‘Lo! Satan has afflicted me with hardship harm and suffering’ pain he attributes all this to Satan even though all things are from God to show reverence in his call to Him exalted be He.
ٱرْكُضْ بِرِجْلِكَ هَـٰذَا مُغْتَسَلٌ بَارِدٌ وَشَرَابٌ,And it was said to him ‘Stamp your foot on the ground — and he stamped it and a spring of water gushed forth and it was said This is a cool bath cool water for you to wash with and a drink’ for you to drink of. So he washed himself and drank from it whereat every ailment that had affected him internally and externally disappeared.
وَوَهَبْنَا لَهُ أَهْلَهُ وَمِثْلَهُمْ مَّعَهُمْ رَحْمَةً مِّنَّا وَذِكْرَىٰ لأُوْلِي ٱلأَلْبَابِ,And We gave him back his family along with others like them that is God brought back to life all the children of his that had died and provided him with as many in addition to them as a mercy a grace from us and a reminder an admonition to people of pith possessors of intellect.
وَخُذْ بِيَدِكَ ضِغْثاً فَٱضْرِب بِّهِ وَلاَ تَحْنَثْ إِنَّا وَجَدْنَاهُ صَابِراً نِّعْمَ ٱلْعَبْدُ إِنَّهُ أَوَّابٌ,And We said to him ‘Take in your hand a bunch of twigs or some blades of grass and smite therewith your wife — for he had sworn to smite her a hundred times on one occasion when she was late in coming to him — and do not break your oath’ by not smiting her so he took a hundred rushes and smote her with them once and that sufficed to fulfil his oath. Truly We found him to be steadfast. What an excellent servant! was Job. Indeed he was a penitent soul always returning to God exalted be He.
وَٱذْكُرْ عِبَادَنَآ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَإِسْحَاقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ أُوْلِي ٱلأَيْدِي وَٱلأَبْصَارِ,And mention also Our servants Abraham and Isaac and Jacob — men of fortitude vigorous in their worship and insight deep understanding of religion a variant reading for ‘ibādanā ‘Our servants’ has singular ‘abdanā ‘Our servant’ with Ibrāhīma as the explication thereof and what follows as being a supplement to ‘abdanā ‘Our servant’.
إِنَّآ أَخْلَصْنَاهُمْ بِخَالِصَةٍ ذِكْرَى ٱلدَّارِ,Assuredly We purified them with an exclusive thought namely the remembrance of the Abode of the Hereafter in other words to always remember it and to work for it a variant reading for bi-khālisatin dhikrā’l-dār has the genitive construction bi-khālisati dhikrā’l-dār making this dhikrā al-dār ‘remembrance of the Abode’ the explicative thereof.
وَإِنَّهُمْ عِندَنَا لَمِنَ ٱلْمُصْطَفَيْنَ ٱلأَخْيَارِ,And indeed in Our sight they are of the elect the excellent akhyār is the plural of khayyir.
وَٱذْكُرْ إِسْمَاعِيلَ وَٱلْيَسَعَ وَذَا ٱلْكِفْلِ وَكُلٌّ مِّنَ ٱلأَخْيَارِ,And mention also Our servants Ishmael and Elisha who was a prophet the lām here in al-Yasa‘ is extra and Dhū’l-Kifl — there is disagreement over whether he was a prophet; it is said that he was so called because he looked after kafala a hundred prophets who had sought refuge with him from being killed. Each that is every one of them was among the excellent akhyār is the plural of khayyir.
هَـٰذَا ذِكْرٌ وَإِنَّ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ لَحُسْنَ مَآبٍ,This is a remembrance of them made by the mention of fair praise of them here; and indeed for the God-fearing who comprise them there will truly be a fair return in the Hereafter —
جَنَّاتِ عَدْنٍ مُّفَتَّحَةً لَّهُمُ ٱلأَبْوَابُ,Gardens of Eden jannāti ‘Adnin is either a substitution for or an explicative supplement to husna ma’ābin ‘a fair return’ whose gates are flung open for them;
مُتَّكِئِينَ فِيهَا يَدْعُونَ فِيهَا بِفَاكِهَةٍ كَثِيرَةٍ وَشَرَابٍ,reclining therein on couches; therein they call for plenteous fruit and drink.
وَعِندَهُمْ قَاصِرَاتُ ٱلطَّرْفِ أَتْرَابٌ,And with them there will be maidens of restrained glances restricting their eyes to their spouses of a like age of the same age girls who are thirty three years of age atrāb is the plural of tirb.
هَـٰذَا مَا تُوعَدُونَ لِيَوْمِ ٱلْحِسَابِ,‘This that is mentioned is what you are promised by way of the unseen there is a shift in the address away from the third to the second person for the Day of Reckoning.
إِنَّ هَـٰذَا لَرِزْقُنَا مَا لَهُ مِن نَّفَادٍ,This is indeed Our provision which will never be exhausted’ in other words one which will never cease this last sentence mā lahu min nafādin is a circumstantial qualifier referring to rizqunā ‘Our provision’; or it is a second predicate of inna ‘indeed’ meaning that it will be ‘everlasting’.
هَـٰذَا وَإِنَّ لِلطَّاغِينَ لَشَرَّ مَآبٍ,That which is mentioned will be the reward for the believers is so; but for the insolent this is a new sentence there will surely be an evil place of return —
جَهَنَّمَ يَصْلَوْنَهَا فَبِئْسَ ٱلْمِهَادُ,Hell which they will enter — an evil resting place!
هَـٰذَا فَلْيَذُوقُوهُ حَمِيمٌ وَغَسَّاقٌ,This chastisement — inferred as so by what follows — let them then taste it burning hot water and pus read ghasāq or ghassāq the festering matter excreted by the inhabitants of the Fire;
وَآخَرُ مِن شَكْلِهِ أَزْوَاجٌ,and other ākhar may be plural or singular kinds of torment resembling it in other words like the boiling water and pus mentioned in pairs of all sorts in other words their chastisement will consist of various kinds.
هَـٰذَا فَوْجٌ مُّقْتَحِمٌ مَّعَكُمْ لاَ مَرْحَباً بِهِمْ إِنَّهُمْ صَالُواْ ٱلنَّارِ,And it will be said to them as they enter the Fire with their followers ‘This is a horde about to plunge to enter with you into the Fire violently — at which point those who used to be followed say no welcome is there for them here! in other words they will find no comfort for them here. They will indeed roast in the Fire’.
قَالُواْ بَلْ أَنتُمْ لاَ مَرْحَباً بِكُمْ أَنتُمْ قَدَّمْتُمُوهُ لَنَا فَبِئْسَ ٱلْقَرَارُ,They the followers say ‘Nay but for you there is no welcome! You prepared this that is disbelief for us. So what an evil abode!’ for us and for you is the Fire.
قَالُواْ رَبَّنَا مَن قَدَّمَ لَنَا هَـٰذَا فَزِدْهُ عَذَاباً ضِعْفاً فِي ٱلنَّارِ,They also say ‘Our Lord whoever prepared this for us give him double his chastisement that is give him in addition the like of his chastisement for his disbelief in the Fire!’
وَقَالُواْ مَا لَنَا لاَ نَرَىٰ رِجَالاً كُنَّا نَعُدُّهُمْ مِّنَ ٱلأَشْرَارِ,And they the disbelievers of Mecca say while they are in the Fire ‘What is the matter with us that we do not see here men whom we used to count in the world among the wicked?
أَتَّخَذْنَاهُمْ سِخْرِيّاً أَمْ زَاغَتْ عَنْهُمُ ٱلأَبْصَار,Did we treat them mockingly? read sukhriyyan or sikhriyyan did we use to deride them in the life of the world the final yā’ in sikhriyyā is attributive. In other words are they missing? Or have our eyes missed them here?’ so that we have not caught sight of them. Such men were the poor among the Muslims like ‘Ammār b. Yāsir Bilāl al-Habashī Suhayb al-Rūmī and Salmān al-Fārisī.
إِنَّ ذَلِكَ لَحَقٌّ تَخَاصُمُ أَهْلِ ٱلنَّارِ,Assuredly that is true such a scene will necessarily take place which is the wrangling of the inhabitants of the Fire — as shown above.
قُلْ إِنَّمَآ أَنَاْ مُنذِرٌ وَمَا مِنْ إِلَـٰهٍ إِلاَّ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْوَاحِدُ ٱلْقَهَّارُ,Say O Muhammad (s) to the disbelievers of Mecca ‘I am only a warner to threaten disbelievers with punishment in the Fire. And there is no god except God the One the All-Compelling of all His creatures;
رَبُّ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْغَفَّارُ,Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them the Mighty Whose way always prevails the ever Forgiving’ of His friends.
قُلْ هُوَ نَبَأٌ عَظِيمٌ,Say to them ‘It is a tremendous tiding
أَنتُمْ عَنْهُ مُعْرِضُونَ,from which you are turning away namely the Qur’ān of which I have informed you and in which I have brought you what can only be known by revelation and that is God’s saying
مَا كَانَ لِيَ مِنْ عِلْمٍ بِٱلْمَلإِ ٱلأَعْلَىٰ إِذْ يَخْتَصِمُونَ,I had no knowledge of the High Council that is to say of the angels when they disputed in the matter of Adam when God exalted be He said to them ‘I am appointing on earth a vicegerent’ to the end of the verse Q. 230.
إِن يُوحَىٰ إِلَيَّ إِلاَّ أَنَّمَآ أَنَاْ نَذِيرٌ مُّبِينٌ,All that is revealed to me is that I am just a plain warner’ one whose warning is clear.
إِذْ قَالَ رَبُّكَ لِلْمَلاَئِكَةِ إِنِّي خَالِقٌ بَشَراً مِّن طِينٍ,Mention when your Lord said to the angels ‘Indeed I am about to create a human being out of clay and this was Adam.
فَإِذَا سَوَّيْتُهُ وَنَفَخْتُ فِيهِ مِن رُّوحِي فَقَعُواْ لَهُ سَاجِدِينَ,So when I have proportioned him completed him and breathed in him when I have caused to flow therein My spirit so that he becomes a living being — the addition of ‘the spirit’ to Adam is an honour for him; the ‘spirit’ is a subtle body that gives life to a human being by permeating him — then fall down in prostration before him!’ — a prostration of salutation that is actually a bow.
فَسَجَدَ ٱلْمَلاَئِكَةُ كُـلُّهُمْ أَجْمَعُونَ,Thereat the angels prostrated all of them together there are two emphases here kulluhum and ajma‘ūn;
إِلاَّ إِبْلِيسَ ٱسْتَكْبَرَ وَكَانَ مِنَ ٱلْكَافِرِينَ,except Iblīs the father of the jinn who was among the audience of angels; he was disdainful and he was one of the disbelievers according to God’s knowledge exalted be He.
قَالَ يٰإِبْلِيسُ مَا مَنَعَكَ أَن تَسْجُدَ لِمَا خَلَقْتُ بِيَدَيَّ أَسْتَكْبَرْتَ أَمْ كُنتَ مِنَ ٱلْعَالِينَ,He said ‘O Iblīs! What prevents you from prostrating before that which I have created with My own hands? in other words whose creation I Myself have undertaken. This in itself is an honour for Adam as God has Himself undertaken the unmediated creation of all creatures. Are you being arrogant now in refraining from prostrating an interrogative meant as a rebuke; or are you of the exalted?’ of the proud and have therefore disdained to prostrate yourself because you are one of them?
قَالَ أَنَاْ خَيْرٌ مِّنْهُ خَلَقْتَنِي مِن نَّارٍ وَخَلَقْتَهُ مِن طِينٍ,He said ‘I am better than him. You created me from fire and You created him from clay’.
قَالَ فَٱخْرُجْ مِنْهَا فَإِنَّكَ رَجِيمٌ,He said ‘Then begone hence that is from Paradise — or it is said begone from the heavens — for you are indeed accursed outcast.
وَإِنَّ عَلَيْكَ لَعْنَتِيۤ إِلَىٰ يَوْمِ ٱلدِّينِ,And indeed My curse shall be on you until the Day of Judgement’ the Day of Requital.
قَالَ رَبِّ فَأَنظِرْنِيۤ إِلَىٰ يَوْمِ يُبْعَثُونَ,He said ‘My Lord then reprieve me until the day when they mankind will be raised’.
قَالَ فَإِنَّكَ مِنَ ٱلْمُنظَرِينَ,He said ‘Then you will indeed be among the reprieved
إِلَىٰ يَوْمِ ٱلْوَقْتِ ٱلْمَعْلُومِ,until the day of the known time’ the time of the First Blast.
قَالَ فَبِعِزَّتِكَ لأُغْوِيَنَّهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ,He said ‘Now by Your might I shall surely pervert them all
إِلاَّ عِبَادَكَ مِنْهُمُ ٱلْمُخْلَصِينَ,except those servants of Yours among them who will be saved’ namely the believers.
قَالَ فَٱلْحَقُّ وَٱلْحَقَّ أَقُولُ,He said ‘So the truth is — and the truth I always speak read both words in the accusative fa’l-haqqa wa’l-haqqa; or with the first in the nominative and the second in the accusative because of the verb aqūlu ‘I speak’ that follows. As for reading the first one in the accusative this would be on account of the mentioned verb qāla ‘he said’; but it is also said to be on account of its being a verbal noun the sense being uhiqqu l-haqqa ‘I establish the truth’; or it is in the accusative by implication if the particle for the oath fa is removed. It the first haqq could also be in the nominative because of its being the subject of a missing predicate as in fa’l-haqqu minnī ‘truth comes from Me’. It is also said that the sentence means fa’l-haqqu qasamī ‘the truth is this oath from Me’ the response to which is the following la-amla’anna … —
لأَمْلأَنَّ جَهَنَّمَ مِنكَ وَمِمَّن تَبِعَكَ مِنْهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ,I shall assuredly fill Hell with you by way of filling it with your progeny and with whoever of them follows you that is of mankind all together’.
قُلْ مَآ أَسْأَلُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ مِنْ أَجْرٍ وَمَآ أَنَآ مِنَ ٱلْمُتَكَلِّفِينَ,Say ‘I do not ask of you in return for this for delivering the Message to you any reward any fee; nor am I an impostor so as to make up the Qur’ān myself.
إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ ذِكْرٌ لِّلْعَالَمِينَ,It is only in other words the Qur’ān is only a reminder an admonition for all worlds those of humans jinn and other rational beings but excluding the angels.
وَلَتَعْلَمُنَّ نَبَأَهُ بَعْدَ حِينِ,And you will assuredly come to know O disbelievers of Mecca its tiding the news of its truth in due time’ that is to say on the Day of Resurrection ‘ilm ‘knowing’ is here being used in the sense of ‘urf ‘experience’; the prefixed lām in la-ta‘lamunna ‘you will assuredly know’ is for an implicit oath in other words what is meant is wa’Llāhi la-ta‘lamunna ‘By God you will assuredly know’.
تَنزِيلُ ٱلْكِتَابِ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ ٱلْعَزِيزِ ٱلْحَكِيمِ,The revelation of the Book the Qur’ān tanzīlu’l-kitābi the subject is from God mina’Llāhi its predicate the Mighty in His kingdom the Wise in His handiwork.
إِنَّآ أَنزَلْنَآ إِلَيْكَ ٱلْكِتَابَ بِٱلْحَقِّ فَٱعْبُدِ ٱللَّهَ مُخْلِصاً لَّهُ ٱلدِّينَ,Indeed We have revealed to you O Muhammad (s) the Book with the truth bi’l-haqqi is semantically connected to anzalnā ‘We have revealed’; so worship God devoting your religion purely to Him pure of any idolatry in other words affirming His Oneness.
أَلاَ لِلَّهِ ٱلدِّينُ ٱلْخَالِصُ وَٱلَّذِينَ ٱتَّخَذُواْ مِن دُونِهِ أَوْلِيَآءَ مَا نَعْبُدُهُمْ إِلاَّ لِيُقَرِّبُونَآ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ زُلْفَىۤ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَحْكُمُ بَيْنَهُمْ فِي مَا هُمْ فِيهِ يَخْتَلِفُونَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لاَ يَهْدِي مَنْ هُوَ كَاذِبٌ كَـفَّارٌ,Surely to God belongs pure religion none other than Him being deserving of it. And those who take besides Him the idols as patrons and they are the disbelievers of Mecca — they say ‘We only worship them so that they may bring us near to God’ zulfā a verbal noun with the sense of taqrīban ‘for the sake of nearness’. God will indeed judge between them and the Muslims concerning that about which they differ of religion and so admit the believers into Paradise and the disbelievers into the Fire. Truly God does not guide one who is a liar attributing a child to Him a disbeliever worshipping other than God.
لَّوْ أَرَادَ ٱللَّهُ أَن يَتَّخِذَ وَلَداً لاَّصْطَفَىٰ مِمَّا يَخْلُقُ مَا يَشَآءُ سُبْحَانَهُ هُوَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْوَاحِدُ ٱلْقَهَّارُ,Had God wanted to take a son — as they allege that He has ‘The Compassionate One has taken to Himself a son’ Q. 1988 He could have chosen from what He has created whatever He willed and taken it as a child instead of the angels whom they claim to be God’s daughters or their claim that ‘Ezra is the son of God’ or that ‘Jesus is the son of God’ cf. Q. 930. Glory be to Him in exaltation of Him as being above that He should take a child. He is God the One the All-Compelling over all His creatures.
خَلَقَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضَ بِٱلْحَقِّ يُكَوِّرُ ٱللَّيْـلَ عَلَى ٱلنَّهَـارِ وَيُكَوِّرُ ٱلنَّـهَارَ عَلَى ٱللَّيْلِ وَسَخَّـرَ ٱلشَّمْسَ وَٱلْقَمَرَ كُـلٌّ يَجْرِي لأَجَـلٍ مُّسَـمًّى أَلا هُوَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْغَفَّارُ,He created the heavens and the earth with the truth bi’l-haqqi is semantically connected to khalaqa ‘He created’. He turns the night into day so that it grows and turns the day into night so that it grows and He has disposed the sun and the moon each running in its course for an appointed term until the Day of Resurrection. Verily it is He Who is the Mighty Whose way always prevails Requiter of His enemies the ever Forgiving of His friends.
خَلَقَكُمْ مِّن نَّفْسٍ وَاحِدَةٍ ثُمَّ جَعَلَ مِنْهَا زَوْجَهَا وَأَنزَلَ لَكُمْ مِّنَ ٱلأَنْعَامِ ثَمَانِيَةَ أَزْوَاجٍ يَخْلُقُكُمْ فِي بُطُونِ أُمَّهَاتِكُـمْ خَلْقاً مِّن بَعْدِ خَلْقٍ فِي ظُلُمَاتٍ ثَلاَثٍ ذَٰلِكُمُ ٱللَّهُ رَبُّكُمْ لَهُ ٱلْمُلْكُ لاۤ إِلَـٰهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ فَأَنَّىٰ تُصْرَفُونَ,He created you from a single soul namely Adam then made from it its mate Eve; and He sent down for you of the cattle of camels cows small cattle sheep and goats eight kinds of each kind a male and a female — as He makes clear in sūrat al-An‘ām Q. 6143f.. He creates you in your mothers’ wombs creation after creation that is to say as a sperm-drop then a blood clot then a foetus in a threefold darkness that is the darkness of the belly that of the womb and that of the placenta. That is God your Lord. To Him belongs all sovereignty. There is no god except Him. Why then are you being turned away? from worshipping Him to worshipping things other than Him?
إِن تَكْفُرُواْ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَنِيٌّ عَنكُمْ وَلاَ يَرْضَىٰ لِعِبَادِهِ ٱلْكُفْرَ وَإِن تَشْكُرُواْ يَرْضَهُ لَكُمْ وَلاَ تَزِرُ وَازِرَةٌ وِزْرَ أُخْرَىٰ ثُمَّ إِلَىٰ رَبِّكُمْ مَّرْجِعُكُـمْ فَيُنَبِّئُكُـمْ بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ إِنَّهُ عَلِيمٌ بِذَاتِ ٱلصُّدُورِ,If you are ungrateful indeed God is Independent of you though He does not approve of ingratitude for His servants even if He should will it to manifest itself in some of them. And if you give thanks to God and thus become believers He will approve of it read yardah or yardahu either lengthening the vowel or not that is of such thankfulness for you. And no burdened soul shall bear the burden of another soul in other words it will not bear the responsibility for it. Then to your Lord will be your return whereat He will inform you of what you used to do. Indeed He is Knower of what is in the breasts of what is in the hearts of men.
وَإِذَا مَسَّ ٱلإِنسَانَ ضُرٌّ دَعَا رَبَّهُ مُنِيباً إِلَيْهِ ثُمَّ إِذَا خَوَّلَهُ نِعْمَةً مِّنْهُ نَسِيَ مَا كَانَ يَدْعُوۤ إِلَيْهِ مِن قَبْلُ وَجَعَلَ لِلَّهِ أَندَاداً لِّيُضِلَّ عَن سَبِيلِهِ قُلْ تَمَتَّعْ بِكُفْرِكَ قَلِيلاً إِنَّكَ مِنْ أَصْحَابِ ٱلنَّارِ,And when distress befalls a person that is the disbeliever he supplicates his Lord he implores turning returning to Him penitently. Then when He bestows on him a grace from Himself he forgets he neglects Him Whom he had supplicated implored before namely God in other words mā functions as min ‘whom’ and sets up equals associates with God that he may lead others astray read li-yadilla or li-yudilla from His way — from the religion of Islam. Say ‘Revel in your ingratitude for a while — for the remainder of your term of life. You shall indeed be among the inhabitants of the Fire’.
أَمَّنْ هُوَ قَانِتٌ آنَآءَ ٱلَّيلِ سَاجِداً وَقَآئِماً يَحْذَرُ ٱلآخِرَةَ وَيَرْجُواْ رَحْمَةَ رَبِّهِ قُلْ هَلْ يَسْتَوِي ٱلَّذِينَ يَعْلَمُونَ وَٱلَّذِينَ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ إِنَّمَا يَتَذَكَّرُ أُوْلُواْ ٱلأَلْبَابِ,Or is he who read softened a-man devotes himself in worship observing duties of obedience in the watches of the night during its hours prostrating and standing in prayer apprehensive of the eventuality of the Hereafter in other words fearing its chastisement and hoping for the mercy the Paradise of his Lord … ? like one who is disobedient through disbelief or otherwise? a variant reading has am-man pronouncing the hamza so that am has the sense of bal ‘rather’. Say ‘Are those who know equal with those who do not know?’ in other words they are not equal just as the person of knowledge is not equal to the ignorant one. Only people of pith possessors of intellect remember only they are admonished.
قُلْ يٰعِبَادِ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ ٱتَّقُواْ رَبَّكُمْ لِلَّذِينَ أَحْسَنُواْ فِي هَـٰذِهِ ٱلدُّنْيَا حَسَنَةٌ وَأَرْضُ ٱللَّهِ وَاسِعَةٌ إِنَّمَا يُوَفَّى ٱلصَّابِرُونَ أَجْرَهُمْ بِغَيْرِ حِسَابٍ,Say ‘O servants of Mine who believe! Fear your Lord that is to say fear His chastisement by being obedient to Him. For those who are virtuous in this world through obedience there will be good and that is Paradise and God’s earth is vast so emigrate throughout it away from the company of disbelievers and the sight of indecencies. Truly the steadfast in their obedience of God and in enduring whatever hardship they may be tested with will be paid their reward in full without any reckoning’ without any measure or any scales to work it out.
قُلْ إِنِّيۤ أُمِرْتُ أَنْ أَعْبُدَ ٱللَّهَ مُخْلِصاً لَّهُ ٱلدِّينَ,Say ‘Indeed I have been commanded to worship God devoting my religion purely to Him pure of any idolatry
وَأُمِرْتُ لأَنْ أَكُونَ أَوَّلَ ٱلْمُسْلِمِينَ,and I have been commanded to be the first of those who submit’ from this community.
قُلْ إِنِّيۤ أَخَافُ إِنْ عَصَيْتُ رَبِّي عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ,Say ‘Indeed should I disobey my Lord I fear the chastisement of a tremendous day’.
قُلِ ٱللَّهَ أَعْبُدُ مُخْلِصاً لَّهُ دِينِي,Say ‘God alone I worship devoting my religion purely to Him pure of any idolatry.
فَٱعْبُدُواْ مَا شِئْتُمْ مِّن دُونِهِ قُلْ إِنَّ ٱلْخَاسِرِينَ ٱلَّذِينَ خَسِرُوۤاْ أَنفُسَهُمْ وَأَهْلِيهِمْ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ أَلاَ ذَلِكَ هُوَ ٱلْخُسْرَانُ ٱلْمُبِينُ,So worship whatever you wish besides Him’ other than Him — herein is a threat for them as well as a declaration of the fact that they do not worship God exalted be He. Say ‘Indeed the losers are those who will have lost their souls and their families on the Day of Resurrection by condemning their souls to abide forever in the Fire and their failure to attaining the bliss promised among the black-eyed virgins who would have been prepared for them in Paradise had they been believers. Truly that is the manifest loss!’
لَهُمْ مِّن فَوْقِهِمْ ظُلَلٌ مِّنَ ٱلنَّارِ وَمِن تَحْتِهِمْ ظُلَلٌ ذَلِكَ يُخَوِّفُ ٱللَّهُ بِهِ عِبَادَهُ يٰعِبَادِ فَٱتَّقُونِ,Above them they will have canopies layers of fire and beneath them they will have similar canopies of fire. That is what God frightens His servants with that is the believing ones that they may have fear of Him — this sense of the verse is suggested by what follows “So O servants of Mine fear Me!”’
وَٱلَّذِينَ ٱجْتَنَبُواْ ٱلطَّاغُوتَ أَن يَعْبُدُوهَا وَأَنَابُوۤاْ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ لَهُمُ ٱلْبُشْرَىٰ فَبَشِّرْ عِبَادِ,As for those who steer clear of the worship of false deities graven images and turn penitently apply themselves to God there are good tidings for them of Paradise. So give such good tidings to My servants
ٱلَّذِينَ يَسْتَمِعُونَ ٱلْقَوْلَ فَيَـتَّبِعُونَ أَحْسَنَهُ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ هَدَاهُمُ ٱللَّهُ وَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمْ أُوْلُواْ ٱلأَلْبَابِ,who listen to the words of God and follow the best sense of it which is that which contains the means to righteousness for them. Those they are the ones whom God has guided; and those they are the people of pith the possessors of intellect.
أَفَمَنْ حَقَّ عَلَيْهِ كَلِمَةُ ٱلْعَذَابِ أَفَأَنتَ تُنقِذُ مَن فِي ٱلنَّارِ,Can he against whom the word of chastisement has been fulfilled …? namely the words I will surely fill Hell with jinn and mankind together Q. 11119; Will you deliver bring out one who is in the Fire? this is the response to the conditional clause in which the overt qualification man fī’l-nār ‘one who is in the Fire’ replaces the pronominalisation a-fa-man ‘he … whom’; the hamza in a-fa-anta ‘will you’ is for rejection in other words the sense is that you will not be able to guide him and therefore deliver him from the Fire.
لَـٰكِنِ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱتَّقَواْ رَبَّهُمْ لَهُمْ غُرَفٌ مِّن فَوْقِهَا غُرَفٌ مَّبْنِيَّةٌ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلأَنْهَارُ وَعْدَ ٱللَّهِ لاَ يُخْلِفُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْمِيعَادَ,But as for those who fear their Lord and therefore obey Him — for them there will be lofty abodes with other lofty abodes built above them with rivers flowing beneath them that is beneath both the upper and the lower abodes — a promise of God wa‘da’Llāhi in the accusative because of an implied verb governing it. God does not fail the tryst He does not break His promise.
أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ أَنزَلَ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مَآءً فَسَلَكَهُ يَنَابِيعَ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ ثُمَّ يُخْرِجُ بِهِ زَرْعاً مُّخْتَلِفاً أَلْوَانُهُ ثُمَّ يَهِـيجُ فَـتَرَاهُ مُصْفَـرّاً ثُمَّ يَجْعَلُهُ حُطَاماً إِنَّ فِي ذَلِكَ لَذِكْرَىٰ لأُوْلِي ٱلأَلْبَابِ,Have you not seen realised that God sends down water from the heaven then conducts it as springs making it enter points of springs in the ground? Then with it He brings forth crops of diverse hues. Then they wither they become dried-out and you see them for example after having been green turning yellow. Then He turns them into chaff. Truly in that there is a reminder for people of pith possessors of intellect by which they may be reminded for it is an indication of God’s Oneness and His power.
أَفَمَن شَرَحَ ٱللَّهُ صَدْرَهُ لِلإِسْلاَمِ فَهُوَ عَلَىٰ نُورٍ مِّن رَّبِّهِ فَوَيْلٌ لِّلْقَاسِيَةِ قُلُوبُهُمْ مِّن ذِكْرِ ٱللَّهِ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ فِي ضَلاَلٍ مُّبِينٍ,Is he whose breast God has opened to Islam and becomes guided so that he follows a light from his Lord …? like he whose heart He has sealed with disbelief? — this understanding of the ellipsis is indicated by what follows. So woe — an expression indicating ‘chastisement’ — to those whose hearts have been hardened against the remembrance of God that is hardened against the acceptance of the Qur’ān. Such are in manifest error.
ٱللَّهُ نَزَّلَ أَحْسَنَ ٱلْحَدِيثِ كِتَاباً مُّتَشَابِهاً مَّثَانِيَ تَقْشَعِرُّ مِنْهُ جُلُودُ ٱلَّذِينَ يَخْشَوْنَ رَبَّهُمْ ثُمَّ تَلِينُ جُلُودُهُمْ وَقُلُوبُهُمْ إِلَىٰ ذِكْرِ ٱللَّهِ ذَلِكَ هُدَى ٱللَّهِ يَهْدِي بِهِ مَن يَشَآءُ وَمَن يُضْلِلِ ٱللَّهُ فَمَا لَهُ مِنْ هَادٍ,God has revealed the best of discourses a Book kitāban substitutes for ahsana ‘the best’ namely a Qur’ān consimilar in other words some of its parts are similar to others in terms of their arrangement and otherwise in coupled phrases — a Book in which the Promise of reward is coupled with the Threat of punishment together with other such couplings — whereat quiver at the mention of whose Threat shiver the skins of those who fear their Lord; then their skins and their hearts soften to they are reassured by the remembrance of God that is at the mention of His Promise. That Book is God’s guidance by which He guides whomever He will of His servants; and whomever God leads astray for him there is no guide.
أَفَمَن يَتَّقِي بِوَجْهِهِ سُوۤءَ ٱلْعَذَابِ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ وَقِيلَ لِلظَّالِمِينَ ذُوقُواْ مَا كُنتُمْ تَكْسِبُونَ,Is he who will be fending off is he who will encounter with his face the awful chastisement on the Day of Resurrection …? that is the most severe chastisement when he is flung into the Fire with his hands bound to his neck in fetters is he like one who will be secure from it by entering Paradise? And it will be said to the wrongdoers namely the disbelievers of Mecca ‘Taste now what you used to earn’ that is taste the requital for it.
كَذَّبَ ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ فَأَتَاهُمُ ٱلْعَـذَابُ مِنْ حَيْثُ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ,Those who were before them denied their messengers with regard to the coming of the chastisement; and so the chastisement came on them whence they were not aware in a way that would never have occurred to them.
فَأَذَاقَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْخِزْيَ فِي ٱلْحَيَاةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَلَعَذَابُ ٱلآخِرَةِ أَكْبَرُ لَوْ كَانُواْ يَعْلَمُونَ,So God made them taste disgrace abasement and humiliation in the way of being transformed into swine and being killed and otherwise in the life of this world. And the chastisement of the Hereafter will surely be greater had they that is the deniers known the nature of the chastisement thereof they would not have denied.
وَلَقَدْ ضَرَبْنَا لِلنَّاسِ فِي هَـٰذَا ٱلْقُرْآنِ مِن كُلِّ مَثَلٍ لَّعَلَّهُمْ يَتَذَكَّرُونَ,And verily We have struck coined for mankind in this Qur’ān every kind of similitude that perhaps they may remember that perhaps they may be admonished —
قُرْآناً عَرَبِيّاً غَيْرَ ذِي عِوَجٍ لَّعَلَّهُمْ يَتَّقُونَ,an Arabic Qur’ān qur’ānan ‘arabiyyan a circumstantial qualifier for emphasis without any deviation that is without any contradiction or variance that perhaps they may guard themselves against disbelief.
ضَرَبَ ٱللَّهُ مَثَلاً رَّجُلاً فِيهِ شُرَكَآءُ مُتَشَاكِسُونَ وَرَجُلاً سَلَماً لِّرَجُلٍ هَلْ يَسْتَوِيَانِ مَثَلاً ٱلْحَمْدُ للَّهِ بَلْ أَكْثَرُهُمْ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ,God strikes for the idolater and the believer in God’s Oneness a similitude a man rajulan substitutes for mathalan ‘a similitude’ shared by several masters quarrelling disputing ill-mannered and a man belonging exclusively to one man. Are the two equal in comparison? mathalan for specification in other words the slave of many masters is not the same as the slave of a single person. For in the case of the former if all of his masters were to demand his service simultaneously he would be confused as to whom of them he should serve — which is the similitude of the idolater; the latter the slave of one is the similitude of the one who believes in the One God. Praise be to God! alone. Nay but most of them that is the people of Mecca do not know the chastisement in which they will end up and so they associate others with God.
إِنَّكَ مَيِّتٌ وَإِنَّهُمْ مَّيِّتُونَ,You — an address to the Prophet s — will indeed die and they too will indeed die and so there is no satisfaction to be gained from another’s death this was revealed because they kept waiting for the Prophet s to die.
ثُمَّ إِنَّكُمْ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ عِندَ رَبِّكُمْ تَخْتَصِمُونَ,Then you will indeed O mankind concerning the injustices you committed towards one another be contending before your Lord on the Day of Resurrection.
فَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّن كَذَبَ علَى ٱللَّهِ وَكَذَّبَ بِٱلصِّدْقِ إِذْ جَآءَهُ أَلَيْسَ فِي جَهَنَّمَ مَثْوًى لِّلْكَافِرِينَ,So who is — in other words none is — a greater wrongdoer than he who imputes falsehood to God by ascribing partners and child to Him and who denies the truth namely the Qur’ān when it reaches him? Is there not a fitting abode in Hell for the disbelievers? Indeed there is.
وَٱلَّذِي جَآءَ بِٱلصِّدْقِ وَصَدَّقَ بِهِ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْمُتَّقُونَ,And he who brings the truth — and that is the Prophet s — and those who confirm it namely the believers here alladhī ‘he who’ has the significance of alladhīna ‘those who’ those they are the ones who guard themselves against idolatry.
لَهُم مَّا يَشَآءُونَ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ ذَلِكَ جَزَآءُ ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,They shall have whatever they wish with their Lord. That is the reward of those who are virtuous to their own souls through their acceptance of faith;
لِيُكَـفِّرَ ٱللَّهُ عَنْهُمْ أَسْوَأَ ٱلَّذِي عَمِلُواْ وَيَجْزِيَهُمْ أَجْرَهُمْ بِأَحْسَنِ ٱلَّذِي كَـانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ,so that God may absolve them of the worst of what they did and pay them their reward by the best of what they used to do aswa’a and ahsana mean simply al-sayyi’ ‘bad’ and al-hasan ‘good’.
أَلَيْسَ ٱللَّهُ بِكَافٍ عَبْدَهُ وَيُخَوِّفُونَكَ بِٱلَّذِينَ مِن دُونِهِ وَمَن يُضْـلِلِ ٱللَّهُ فَمَا لَهُ مِنْ هَـادٍ,Does God not suffice as defender of His servant? the Prophet? Indeed He does. Yet they would frighten you — the address is for him s — of those besides Him namely the idols by telling him that these idols might kill him or render him insane. And whomever God leads astray for him there is no guide.
وَمَن يَهْدِ ٱللَّهُ فَمَا لَهُ مِن مُّضِلٍّ أَلَيْسَ ٱللَّهُ بِعَزِيزٍ ذِي ٱنتِقَامٍ,But whomever God guides there is no one able to lead him astray. Is not God Mighty One Whose way always prevails a Lord of Retribution? against His enemies? Indeed He is.
وَلَئِن سَأَلْتَهُمْ مَّنْ خَلَقَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضَ لَيَقُولُنَّ ٱللَّهُ قُلْ أَفَرَأَيْتُم مَّا تَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ إِنْ أَرَادَنِيَ ٱللَّهُ بِضُرٍّ هَلْ هُنَّ كَاشِفَاتُ ضُرِّهِ أَوْ أَرَادَنِي بِرَحْمَةٍ هَلْ هُنَّ مُمْسِكَاتُ رَحْمَتِهِ قُلْ حَسْبِيَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ يَتَوَكَّـلُ ٱلْمُتَوَكِّلُونَ,And if wa-la-in the lām is for oaths you ask them ‘Who created the heavens and the earth?’ they will surely say ‘God.’ Say ‘Have you considered then those on whom you call those whom you worship besides God namely the idols if God should desire some harm to befall me would they be able to remove the harm imposed by Him? No! Or if He should desire some mercy for me would they be able to withhold His mercy?’ No! a variant reading for the two clauses kāshifātun durrahu and mumsikātun rahmatahu has the genitive construction kāshifātu durrihi and mumsikātu rahmatihi. Say ‘God is sufficient for me. In Him do all the trusting put their trust’.
قُلْ يٰقَوْمِ ٱعْمَلُواْ عَلَىٰ مَكَانَتِكُـمْ إِنِّي عَامِلٌ فَسَوْفَ تَعْلَمُونَ,Say ‘O my people! Act according to your situation according to your circumstances I too am acting according to my circumstances. For you will come to know
مَن يَأْتِيهِ عَذَابٌ يُخْزِيهِ وَيَحِلُّ عَلَيْهِ عَذَابٌ مُّقِيمٌ,to whom man introduces the relative clause that is the direct object of the action of ‘knowing’ will come a chastisement that will disgrace him and on whom there will descend a lasting chastisement’ an everlasting one namely the chastisement of the Fire. Indeed God then disgraced them at Badr.
إِنَّآ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْكَ ٱلْكِتَابَ لِلنَّـاسِ بِٱلْحَقِّ فَـمَنِ ٱهْتَـدَىٰ فَلِنَفْسِهِ وَمَن ضَـلَّ فَإنَّمَا يَضِلُّ عَلَيْهَا وَمَآ أَنتَ عَلَيْهِم بِوَكِـيلٍ,Truly We have revealed the Book to you for the sake of mankind with the truth bi’l-haqqi is semantically connected to anzalnā ‘We have revealed’. So whoever is guided then it his being guided is for the sake of his own soul and whoever goes astray goes astray only to the detriment thereof. And you are not meant to be a guardian over them and so compel them to embrace guidance.
ٱللَّهُ يَتَوَفَّى ٱلأَنفُسَ حِينَ مَوْتِـهَا وَٱلَّتِي لَمْ تَمُتْ فِي مَنَامِـهَا فَيُمْسِكُ ٱلَّتِي قَضَىٰ عَلَيْهَا ٱلْمَوْتَ وَيُرْسِلُ ٱلأُخْرَىٰ إِلَىٰ أَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّى إِنَّ فِي ذَلِكَ لآيَاتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يَتَفَكَّرُونَ,God takes the souls at the time of their death and He takes those that have not died in their sleep in other words He takes them during sleep. Then He retains those for whom He has ordained death and releases the others until an appointed term that is until the time of their death. The one that is released is the soul that possesses the faculty of discernment without which the soul containing the force of life is able to remain temporarily — but this cannot be the other way round. Truly in that mentioned there are signs indications for a people who reflect and then realise that the One with the power to do this also has the power to resurrect — Quraysh however never reflected on this fact.
أَمِ ٱتَّخَذُواْ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ شُفَعَآءَ قُلْ أَوَلَوْ كَـانُواْ لاَ يَمْلِكُونَ شَيْئاً وَلاَ يَعْقِلُونَ,Or have they — nay but they have — taken besides God idols as gods to act as intercessors? with God as they are wont to allege. Say to them ‘What! will they intercede even though they have no power whatever of intercession or otherwise and are unable to comprehend?’ that you worship them or to comprehend anything else for that matter? Nay.
قُل لِلَّهِ ٱلشَّفَاعَةُ جَمِيعاً لَّهُ مُلْكُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ ثُمَّ إِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ,Say ‘All intercession belongs solely to God that is to say He has exclusive control over it and so none can intercede except with His permission. To Him belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth; then to Him you will be brought back’.
وَإِذَا ذُكِرَ ٱللَّهُ وَحْدَهُ ٱشْمَأَزَّتْ قُلُوبُ ٱلَّذِينَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱلآخِرَةِ وَإِذَا ذُكِرَ ٱلَّذِينَ مِن دُونِهِ إِذَا هُمْ يَسْتَبْشِرُونَ,And when God is mentioned alone that is without the mention of their gods thereat shrink they are repelled and they become constricted the hearts of those who do not believe in the Hereafter; but when those others besides Him namely the idols are mentioned behold they rejoice!
قُلِ ٱللَّهُمَّ فَاطِرَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ عَالِمَ ٱلْغَيْبِ وَٱلشَّهَادَةِ أَنتَ تَحْكُمُ بَيْنَ عِبَادِكَ فِي مَا كَانُواْ فِيهِ يَخْتَلِفُونَ,Say ‘O God! Allāhumma means yā Allāh Originator of the heavens and the earth! the Creator of them without precedent Knower of the Unseen and the visible Knower of what is hidden and what is witnessed You will judge between Your servants concerning that wherein they used to differ’ in the matter of religion guide me to the truth over which they are at variance.
وَلَوْ أَنَّ لِلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ مَا فِي ٱلأَرْضِ جَمِيعاً وَمِثْلَهُ مَعَهُ لاَفْتَدَوْاْ بِهِ مِن سُوۤءِ ٱلْعَذَابِ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ وَبَدَا لَهُمْ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ مَا لَمْ يَكُونُواْ يَحْتَسِبُونَ,And even if the evildoers possessed all that is in the earth and as much of it besides they would surely offer it to ransom themselves from the terrible chastisement on the Day of Resurrection. And there will appear there will become manifest to them from God that which they had never reckoned what they never supposed they would see.
وَبَدَا لَهُمْ سَيِّئَاتُ مَا كَـسَبُواْ وَحَاقَ بِهِم مَّا كَانُواْ بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِئُونَ,And there will appear to them the evils of what they had earned and they will be besieged by there will descend on them that which they used to deride in other words the chastisement.
فَإِذَا مَسَّ ٱلإِنسَانَ ضُرٌّ دَعَانَا ثُمَّ إِذَا خَوَّلْنَاهُ نِعْمَةً مِّنَّا قَالَ إِنَّمَآ أُوتِيتُهُ عَلَىٰ عِلْمٍ بَلْ هِيَ فِتْنَةٌ وَلَـٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَهُمْ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ,So when some distress befalls man al-insān here a generic he supplicates Us. Then when We bestow on him a grace from Us he says ‘I was given it merely by force of knowledge’ from God that I was deserving of it. Nay but it this saying is a trial a test by which servants are tested. But most of them do not know that such bestowal of grace is a way of drawing them on and a test of their faith.
قَدْ قَالَهَا ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ فَمَآ أَغْنَىٰ عَنْهُمْ مَّا كَانُواْ يَكْسِبُونَ,Already the same was said by those who were before them of communities such as Korah and those of his people who were content with such a saying. But what they used to earn did not avail them.
فَأَصَابَهُمْ سَيِّئَاتُ مَا كَسَبُواْ وَٱلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ مِنْ هَـٰؤُلاَءِ سَيُصِيبُهُمْ سَيِّئَاتُ مَا كَسَبُواْ وَمَا هُمْ بِمُعْجِزِينَ,So the evils of what they earned smote them that is the requital thereof smote them. And the evildoers among these namely among Quraysh shall also be smitten by the evils of what they earned and they will not be able to thwart it they will not elude Our chastisement — thus they were made to suffer seven years of drought and only afterwards were they enriched with provision from God.
أَوَلَمْ يَعْلَمُوۤاْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَبْسُطُ ٱلرِّزْقَ لِمَن يَشَآءُ وَيَقْدِرُ إِنَّ فِي ذَلِكَ لآيَاتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يُؤْمِنُونَ,Do they not know that God extends His provision that He makes it abundant for whomever He will as a test and restricts it? for whomever He will as a trial? Truly in that there are signs for a people who believe in Him.
قُلْ يٰعِبَادِيَ ٱلَّذِينَ أَسْرَفُواْ عَلَىٰ أَنفُسِهِمْ لاَ تَقْنَطُواْ مِن رَّحْمَةِ ٱللَّهِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَغْفِرُ ٱلذُّنُوبَ جَمِيعاً إِنَّهُ هُوَ ٱلْغَفُورُ ٱلرَّحِيمُ,Say that God declares ‘O My servants who have been prodigal against their own souls do not despair read taqnitū taqnatū or taqnutū do not give up hope of God’s mercy. Truly God forgives all sins for those who repent from idolatry. Truly He is the Forgiving the Merciful.
وَأَنِـيبُوۤاْ إِلَىٰ رَبِّكُمْ وَأَسْلِمُواْ لَهُ مِن قَبْلِ أَن يَأْتِيَكُمُ ٱلْعَذَابُ ثُمَّ لاَ تُنصَرُونَ,And turn return penitently to your Lord and submit perform deeds sincerely to Him before the chastisement comes on you whereupon you will not be helped to ward it off if you have not repented.
وَٱتَّبِعُـوۤاْ أَحْسَنَ مَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكُم مِّن رَّبِّكُـمْ مِّن قَبْلِ أَن يَأْتِيَكُـمُ ٱلْعَذَابُ بَغْتَةً وَأَنتُمْ لاَ تَشْعُرُونَ,And follow the best of what has been revealed to you from your Lord — namely the Qur’ān — before the chastisement comes on you suddenly while you are unaware’ of the time of its arrival until it has actually come;
أَن تَقُولَ نَفْسٌ يٰحَسْرَتَا عَلَىٰ مَا فَرَّطَتُ فِي جَنبِ ٱللَّهِ وَإِن كُنتُ لَمِنَ ٱلسَّاخِرِينَ,so apply yourselves to this before any soul should say ‘Alas for me yā hasratā is actually yā hasratī meaning ‘O regret of mine’ for what I have neglected of my duty to God in other words of obedience to Him. Indeed wa-in in is softened in place of the hardened form in other words understand it as wa-innī I was among those who ridiculed’ His religion and His Book;
أَوْ تَقُولَ لَوْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ هَدَانِي لَكُـنتُ مِنَ ٱلْمُتَّقِينَ,or before that it should say ‘If only God had guided me to obedience and I had become guided I would have been among those who have feared’ His chastisement;
أَوْ تَقُولَ حِينَ تَرَى ٱلْعَذَابَ لَوْ أَنَّ لِي كَـرَّةً فَأَكُونَ مِنَ ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ,or before that it should say when it sees the chastisement ‘If only there had been a second chance a return to this world I would be among the virtuous’ the believers. It is then said to him by God
بَلَىٰ قَدْ جَآءَتْكَ آيَاتِي فَكَذَّبْتَ بِهَا وَٱسْتَكْبَرْتَ وَكُنتَ مِنَ ٱلْكَافِرِينَ,‘Yes indeed! My signs came to you the Qur’ān — which is the means to guidance — but you denied them and were arrogant you disdained to believe in them and you were among the disbelievers’.
وَيَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ تَرَى ٱلَّذِينَ كَذَبُواْ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ وُجُوهُهُم مُّسْوَدَّةٌ أَلَيْسَ فِي جَهَنَّمَ مَثْوًى لِّلْمُتَكَبِّرِينَ,And on the Day of Resurrection you will see those who imputed lies to God by ascribing partner and child to Him with their faces blackened. Is there not in Hell a fitting abode for those who are too arrogant? to believe? Indeed there is.
وَيُنَجِّي ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱتَّقَوْاْ بِمَفَازَتِهِمْ لاَ يَمَسُّهُمُ ٱلسُّوۤءُ وَلاَ هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ,And God will deliver from Hell those who fear idolatry because of their triumph that is on account of the place they have won in Paradise by placing them in it. No evil will touch them nor will they grieve.
ٱللَّهُ خَالِقُ كُـلِّ شَيْءٍ وَهُوَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ وَكِيلٌ,God is the Creator of all things and He is Guardian over all things disposing of them as He will.
لَّهُ مَقَالِيدُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ بِـآيَاتِ ٱللَّهِ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْخَاسِرُونَ,To Him belong the keys of the heavens and the earth in other words the keys to their storehouses of rain and vegetation and other things. And those who disbelieve in the signs of God such as the Qur’ān — those they are the losers ūlā’ika humu’l-khāsirūna is semantically connected to His words wa-yunajjī’Llāhu’lladhīna ittaqaw ‘and God will deliver those who guarded themselves …’ to the end of that statement; the intervening statements are parentheticals.
قُلْ أَفَغَيْرَ ٱللَّهِ تَأْمُرُونِّيۤ أَعْبُدُ أَيُّهَا ٱلْجَاهِلُونَ,Say ‘Is it something other than God that you bid me to worship O you who are ignorant?’ ghayra is in the accusative because of the verb a‘budu ‘I worship’ which itself is operated by ta’murūnī ‘you bid me’ read with one nūn on the basis of an implicit an; it ta’murūnī may also be read with two nūns assimilated ta’murūnnī or separated ta’murūnanī.
وَلَقَدْ أُوْحِيَ إِلَيْكَ وَإِلَى ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكَ لَئِنْ أَشْرَكْتَ لَيَحْبَطَنَّ عَمَلُكَ وَلَتَكُونَنَّ مِنَ ٱلْخَاسِرِينَ,And certainly it has been revealed to you and to those before you that by God! if you associate others with God O Muhammad (s) — hypothetically — your work shall surely fail and you shall surely be among the losers’.
بَلِ ٱللَّهَ فَٱعْبُدْ وَكُن مِّنَ ٱلشَّاكِرِينَ,Rather worship God alone and be among the thankful of His bestowal of graces on you.
وَمَا قَدَرُواْ ٱللَّهَ حَقَّ قَدْرِهِ وَٱلأَرْضُ جَمِيعـاً قَبْضَـتُهُ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَـٰمَةِ وَٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتُ مَطْوِيَّاتٌ بِيَمِينِهِ سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَىٰ عَمَّا يُشْرِكُونَ,And they do not esteem God as He should be esteemed they do not understand His true nature or it means that they do not exalt Him with the exaltation truly worthy of Him when they associate others with Him. And the entire earth jamī‘an is a circumstantial qualifier in other words the seven earths will be in His grasp in other words it shall be grasped by Him meaning that it will be in His possession and at His disposal on the Day of Resurrection and the heavens will be rolled up brought together in His Right Hand by His power. Glory be to Him! And exalted be He above what they associate! with Him of partners.
وَنُفِخَ فِي ٱلصُّورِ فَصَعِقَ مَن فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَن فِي ٱلأَرْضِ إِلاَّ مَن شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ ثُمَّ نُفِخَ فِيهِ أُخْرَىٰ فَإِذَا هُمْ قِيَامٌ يَنظُرُونَ,And the Trumpet will be blown for the First Blast and whoever is in the heavens and whoever is in the earth will swoon will die except whomever God wills such as the houris the beautiful youths of Paradise and others. Then it will be blown again and behold they that is all creatures who are dead will rise up looking on waiting to see what will be done with them.
وَأَشْرَقَتِ ٱلأَرْضُ بِنُورِ رَبِّهَا وَوُضِعَ ٱلْكِتَابُ وَجِـيءَ بِٱلنَّبِيِّيْنَ وَٱلشُّهَدَآءِ وَقُضِيَ بَيْنَهُم بِٱلْحَقِّ وَهُمْ لاَ يُظْلَمُونَ,And the earth will shine with the light of its Lord when God reveals Himself for the passing of judgement and the Book of deeds shall be set in place for the Reckoning and the prophets and witnesses namely Muhammad (s) and his community will be brought to bear witness that the messengers delivered the Message to their respective communities. And judgement will be made between them with truth in other words justly and they will not be wronged in a single thing.
وَوُفِّيَتْ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ مَّا عَمِلَتْ وَهُوَ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا يَفْعَلُونَ,And every soul will be paid in full for what it did that is it will be paid the requital thereof and He is best aware of what they do and has no need for any witnesses.
وَسِيقَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَـفَرُوۤاْ إِلَىٰ جَهَنَّمَ زُمَراً حَتَّىٰ إِذَا جَآءُوهَا فُتِحَتْ أَبْوَابُهَا وَقَالَ لَهُمْ خَزَنَتُهَآ أَلَمْ يَأْتِكُمْ رُسُلٌ مِّنكُمْ يَتْلُونَ عَلَيْكُمْ آيَاتِ رَبِّكُمْ وَيُنذِرُونَكُمْ لِقَـآءَ يَوْمِكُمْ هَـٰذَا قَالُواْ بَلَىٰ وَلَـٰكِنْ حَقَّتْ كَلِمَةُ ٱلْعَذَابِ عَلَى ٱلْكَافِرِينَ,And those who disbelieve will be driven violently to Hell in troops in separate groups until when they reach it its gates are opened futihat abwābuhā is the response to idhā ‘when’ and its keepers will say to them ‘Did there not come to you any messengers from among yourselves reciting to you the signs of your Lord the Qur’ān and otherwise and warning you of the encounter of this day of yours?’ They will say ‘Yes indeed; but the word of chastisement — namely the verse Assuredly I will fill Hell … Q. 11119 — against the disbelievers has been fulfilled’.
قِيلَ ٱدْخُلُوۤاْ أَبْوَابَ جَهَنَّمَ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا فَبِئْسَ مَثْوَى ٱلْمُتَكَـبِّرِينَ,It will be said ‘Enter the gates of Hell to abide therein’ — decreed for you to abide therein. For evil indeed is the abode of the arrogant!’
وَسِيقَ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱتَّقَوْاْ رَبَّهُمْ إِلَى ٱلّجَنَّةِ زُمَراً حَتَّىٰ إِذَا جَآءُوهَا وَفُتِحَتْ أَبْوَابُهَا وَقَالَ لَهُمْ خَزَنَتُهَا سَلاَمٌ عَلَيْكُـمْ طِبْتُمْ فَٱدْخُلُوهَا خَالِدِينَ,And those who feared their Lord will be driven gently to Paradise in troops until when they reach it and its gates are opened wa-futihat the wāw here indicates a circumstantial qualifier implying qad ‘already’ and its keepers will say to them ‘Peace be to you! You are good! tibtum a circumstantial qualifier So enter it to abide therein’ — enter it with the decree that you are to abide in it forever the response to idhā ‘when’ is implicit and is in other words dakhalūhā ‘they enter it’. The manner of their being driven as well as the opening of the gates before their arrival is a way of honouring them; the driving of the disbelievers however and the opening of the gates only upon their arrival so that all of its heat is retained for them is a means of humiliating them.
وَقَـالُواْ ٱلْحَـمْدُ للَّهِ ٱلَّذِي صَدَقَنَا وَعْدَهُ وَأَوْرَثَنَا ٱلأَرْضَ نَتَبَوَّأُ مِنَ ٱلْجَنَّةِ حَيْثُ نَشَآءُ فَنِعْمَ أَجْرُ ٱلْعَامِلِينَ,And they will say this is a supplement to the implicit response dakhalūhā ‘they enter it’ ‘Praise be to God Who has fulfilled His promise to us of Paradise and has made us inherit the land the land of Paradise that we may settle in Paradise wherever we wish’ for it is all Paradise and there is no spot that can be preferred to another. So how excellent is Paradise as the reward of those who worked hard!
وَتَرَى ٱلْمَلاَئِكَةَ حَآفِّينَ مِنْ حَوْلِ ٱلْعَرْشِ يُسَبِّحُونَ بِحَمْدِ رَبِّهِمْ وَقُضِيَ بَيْنَهُمْ بِٱلْحَقِّ وَقِيلَ ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ ٱلْعَالَمِينَ,And you will see the angels encircling hāffīna a circumstantial qualifier all round the Throne from its every side glorifying yusabbihūn is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the person of the participle hāffīn with praise of their Lord continuously proclaiming His praise — in other words saying subhāna’Llāhi wa-bi-hamdih ‘Glory and praise be to God!’ — and judgement will be made between them that is between all creatures with truth in other words with justice so that believers enter Paradise while the disbelievers enter the Fire and it will be said ‘Praise be to God the Lord of the Worlds!’ — the final establishing of both groups in their respective abodes is concluded with this angelic praise.
حـمۤ,Hā mīm God knows best what He means by these letters.
تَنزِيلُ ٱلْكِتَابِ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ ٱلْعَزِيزِ ٱلْعَلِيمِ,The revelation of the Book the Qur’ān tanzīlu’l-kitābi is the subject is from God mina’Llāhi is its predicate the Mighty in His kingdom the Knower of His creatures.
غَافِرِ ٱلذَّنبِ وَقَابِلِ ٱلتَّوْبِ شَدِيدِ ٱلْعِقَابِ ذِي ٱلطَّوْلِ لاَ إِلَـٰهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ إِلَيْهِ ٱلْمَصِيرُ,Forgiver of sins for believers and Accepter of repentance from them al-tawb is the verbal noun Severe in punishment of disbelievers — in other words One Who makes it severe for them — One of abundant bounty bestower of abundant grace — God is eternally possessed of all of these attributes and so the annexation construction using the derivatives of these attributes is for the purposes of characterisation as in the case of the last. There is no god except Him; to Him is the journeying the ultimate return.
مَا يُجَادِلُ فِيۤ آيَاتِ ٱللَّهِ إِلاَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ فَلاَ يَغْرُرْكَ تَقَلُّبُهُمْ فِي ٱلْبِلاَدِ,None dispute the signs of God — the Qur’ān — except those who disbelieve from among the people of Mecca so do not be deceived by their bustle in the towns going about seeking their livelihood in security for the sequel for them will be the Fire.
كَـذَّبَتْ قَبْلَهُمْ قَوْمُ نُوحٍ وَٱلأَحْزَابُ مِن بَعْدِهِمْ وَهَمَّتْ كُـلُّ أُمَّةٍ بِرَسُولِهِمْ لِيَأْخُذُوهُ وَجَادَلُوا بِٱلْبَاطِلِ لِيُدْحِضُواْ بِهِ ٱلْحَقَّ فَأَخَذْتُهُمْ فَكَيْفَ كَانَ عِقَابِ,The people of Noah denied before them and also the factions such as ‘Ād Thamūd and others who came after them. And every community sought to seize their messenger to slay him and they argued falsely thinking to rebut to eliminate thereby the truth. Then I seized them with punishment; so how fitting was My punishment! of them — in other words it was appropriate.
وَكَذَلِكَ حَقَّتْ كَلِمَةُ رَبِّكَ عَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوۤاْ أَنَّهُمْ أَصْحَابُ ٱلنَّارِ,And thus was the word of your Lord — namely the verse Assuredly I will fill Hell … Q. 11119 — fulfilled against those who disbelieve that they shall be the inhabitants of the Fire annahum ashābu’l-nāri substitutes for kalimatu ‘the word’.
ٱلَّذِينَ يَحْمِلُونَ ٱلْعَرْشَ وَمَنْ حَوْلَهُ يُسَبِّحُونَ بِحَمْدِ رَبِّهِمْ وَيُؤْمِنُونَ بِهِ وَيَسْتَغْفِرُونَ لِلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ رَبَّنَا وَسِعْتَ كُـلَّ شَيْءٍ رَّحْمَةً وَعِلْماً فَٱغْفِرْ لِلَّذِينَ تَابُواْ وَٱتَّبَعُواْ سَبِيلَكَ وَقِهِمْ عَذَابَ ٱلْجَحِيمِ,Those who bear the Throne alladhīna yahmilūna’l-‘arsha is the subject and those around it wa-man hawlahu is a supplement to that subject glorify yusabbihūna is the predicate thereof with praise of their Lord continuously proclaiming praise in other words continuously saying subhāna’Llāhi wa-bi-hamdihi ‘Glory and praise be to God’; and they believe in Him exalted be He through their power of discernment in other words they affirm the truth of His Oneness and they ask forgiveness for those who believe saying ‘Our Lord You embrace all things in Your mercy and knowledge that is to say Your mercy embraces all things and Your knowledge also embraces all things. So forgive those who repent of idolatry and follow Your way — the religion of Islam — and shield them from the chastisement of Hell-fire that is the Fire.
رَبَّنَا وَأَدْخِلْهُمْ جَنَّاتِ عَدْنٍ ٱلَّتِي وَعَدْتَّهُمْ وَمَن صَـلَحَ مِنْ آبَآئِهِمْ وَأَزْوَاجِهِمْ وَذُرِّيَّاتِهِمْ إِنَّكَ أَنتَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ,Our Lord and admit them into the Gardens of Eden as a place of residence for them that which You have promised them along with whoever were righteous wa-man salaha is a supplement either to the pronominal third person plural suffix hum ‘them’ in wa-adkhilhum ‘and admit them’ or in wa‘adttahum ‘You have promised them’ among their fathers and their wives and their descendants. Surely You are the One Who is the Mighty the Wise in what He does.
وَقِهِمُ ٱلسَّيِّئَاتِ وَمَن تَقِ ٱلسَّيِّئَاتِ يَوْمَئِذٍ فَقَدْ رَحِمْتَهُ وَذَلِكَ هُوَ ٱلْفَوْزُ ٱلْعَظِيمُ,And shield them from evil deeds that is from the chastisement thereof; for whomever You shield from evil deeds that day the Day of Resurrection verily him You will have had been merciful to; and that is indeed the supreme triumph’.
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ يُنَادَوْنَ لَمَقْتُ ٱللَّهِ أَكْبَرُ مِن مَّقْتِكُمْ أَنفُسَكُـمْ إِذْ تُدْعَوْنَ إِلَى ٱلإِيمَانِ فَتَكْفُرُونَ,Indeed to those who disbelieve it will be proclaimed to them from the part of the angels as they disbelievers enter the Fire in utter loathing of themselves ‘Surely God’s loathing of you is greater than your loathing of yourselves as you were called during life in this world to faith but you used to disbelieve’.
قَالُواْ رَبَّنَآ أَمَتَّنَا ٱثْنَتَيْنِ وَأَحْيَيْتَنَا ٱثْنَتَيْنِ فَٱعْتَرَفْنَا بِذُنُوبِنَا فَهَلْ إِلَىٰ خُرُوجٍ مِّن سَبِيلٍ,They will say ‘Our Lord You have caused us to die twice two deaths and You have given us life twice — for they were lifeless drops of semen then they were given life then made to die then brought back to life for the Resurrection. We now confess our sins in having disbelieved in the Resurrection. Is there then any way to go out?’ out of the Fire and return to the world to be obedient to our Lord? The answer given to them will be No!
ذَلِكُم بِأَنَّهُ إِذَا دُعِيَ ٱللَّهُ وَحْدَهُ كَـفَرْتُمْ وَإِن يُشْرَكْ بِهِ تُؤْمِنُواْ فَٱلْحُكْمُ للَّهِ ٱلْعَلِـيِّ ٱلْكَبِيرِ,That namely the chastisement which you find yourselves in is because during the life of this world when God was invoked alone you would disbelieve in His Oneness; but if partners were ascribed to Him you would believe you would accept such idolatry. So the judgement to chastise you belongs to God the Exalted above His creation the Great the Tremendous.
هُوَ ٱلَّذِي يُرِيكُمْ آيَاتِهِ وَيُنَزِّلُ لَكُم مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ رِزْقاً وَمَا يَتَذَكَّرُ إِلاَّ مَن يُنِيبُ,He it is Who shows you His signs the proofs of His Oneness and sends down from the heaven for you provision by way of rain. Yet no one remembers no one is admonished except him who returns penitently who recants idolatry.
فَٱدْعُواْ ٱللَّهَ مُخْلِصِينَ لَهُ ٱلدِّينَ وَلَوْ كَرِهَ ٱلْكَافِرُونَ,So supplicate God worship Him devoting your religion purely to Him free from any idolatry however much the disbelievers be averse to its being free of such idolatry.
رَفِيعُ ٱلدَّرَجَاتِ ذُو ٱلْعَرْشِ يُلْقِي ٱلرُّوحَ مِنْ أَمْرِهِ عَلَىٰ مَن يَشَآءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ لِيُنذِرَ يَوْمَ ٱلتَّلاَقِ,Exalter of ranks either means that God is One Whose attributes are majestic — or it means the raiser of the ranks of believers in Paradise — Lord of the Throne in other words the Creator thereof He casts the Spirit the Revelation of His command that is of His words upon whomever He will of His servants that he the one upon whom it is cast may warn them of that he may make people fear the Day of Encounter read yawma’l-talāqi omitting the final long yā’ or yawma’l-talāqī that is to say the Day of Resurrection so called because thereat the inhabitants of the heavens will encounter those of the earth and the worshipper will encounter the one whom he worshipped and the wrongdoer will encounter the person whom he wronged;
يَوْمَ هُم بَارِزُونَ لاَ يَخْفَىٰ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ مِنْهُمْ شَيْءٌ لِّمَنِ ٱلْمُلْكُ ٱلْيَوْمَ لِلَّهِ ٱلْوَاحِدِ ٱلْقَهَّارِ,the day when they will emerge the day they will exit from their graves; nothing about them will be hidden from God. ‘To whom does Sovereignty belong today?’ — God exalted be He asks this and Himself responds — ‘To God the One the All-compelling!’ over His creatures.
ٱلْيَوْمَ تُجْزَىٰ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ بِمَا كَـسَبَتْ لاَ ظُلْمَ ٱلْيَوْمَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ سَرِيعُ ٱلْحِسَابِ,Today every soul shall be requited for what it has earned; there will be no injustice today. Indeed God is swift at reckoning’ reckoning with all of creation in the space of half a day of the days of this world — a hadīth states this.
وَأَنذِرْهُمْ يَوْمَ ٱلأَزِفَةِ إِذِ ٱلْقُلُوبُ لَدَى ٱلْحَنَاجِرِ كَاظِمِينَ مَا لِلظَّالِمِينَ مِنْ حَمِيمٍ وَلاَ شَفِيعٍ يُطَاعُ,And warn them of the Impending Day namely the Day of Resurrection al-azifa as in azifa al-rahīlu ‘departure is very near’ when the hearts will rising up in fear reach the throats choking with anguish filled with suppressed anxiety kāzimīna is a circumstantial qualifier referring to al-qulūbu ‘the hearts’ which is qualified by the active animate participle plural kāzimīna and referred to as though they were the very individuals themselves. The evildoers will not have any intimate friend any sympathiser nor any intercessor who might be heeded — the adjectival qualification ‘who might be heeded’ has no literal significance for they do not have intercessors in the first place So now we have no intercessors … Q. 26100. The first part however may be said to have significance if understand on the basis of their claim to have intercessors and so in other words even if — hypothetically speaking — they their intercessors did intercede for them they would not be heeded.
يَعْلَمُ خَآئِنَةَ ٱلأَعْيُنِ وَمَا تُخْفِي ٱلصُّدُورُ,He namely God knows the treachery of the eyes when it steals a glance at what is prohibited for it to look at and what the breasts hide — what the hearts hide.
وَٱللَّهُ يَقْضِي بِٱلْحَقِّ وَٱلَّذِينَ يَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِهِ لاَ يَقْضُونَ بِشَيْءٍ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ هُوَ ٱلسَّمِيعُ ٱلْبَصِيرُ,And God decrees with truth while those on whom they call whom they worship that is the disbelievers of Mecca read yad‘ūna ‘they call’ or tad‘ūna ‘you call’ besides Him — and these are the idols — do not decree by any means at all so how can they be God’s associates? Truly God is the Hearer of their sayings the Seer of their actions.
أَوَلَمْ يَسِيروُاْ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ فَيَنظُرُواْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَاقِبَةُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَانُواْ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ كَانُواْ هُمْ أَشَدَّ مِنْهُمْ قُوَّةً وَآثَاراً فِي ٱلأَرْضِ فَأَخَذَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ بِذُنُوبِهِمْ وَمَا كَانَ لَهُم مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ مِن وَاقٍ,Have they not travelled in the land and beheld the nature of the consequence for those who were before them? They were more powerful than them a variant reading has minkum ‘than yourselves’ in strength and in their vestiges on earth in the way of large structures and palaces. Yet God seized them He destroyed them for their sins and they had none to shield them from God from His chastisement.
ذَلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ كَانَت تَّأْتِيهِمْ رُسُلُهُم بِٱلْبَيِّنَاتِ فَكَفَرُواْ فَأَخَذَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ إِنَّهُ قَوِيٌّ شَدِيدُ ٱلْعِقَابِ,That was because their messengers used to bring them clear signs manifest miracles but they disbelieved. So God seized them. Indeed He is Strong Severe in punishment.
وَلَقَدْ أَرْسَلْنَا مُوسَىٰ بِآيَاتِنَا وَسُلْطَانٍ مُّبِينٍ,And verily We sent Moses with Our signs and a clear warrant an evident and manifest proof
إِلَىٰ فِرْعَوْنَ وَهَامَانَ وَقَارُونَ فَقَالُواْ سَاحِرٌ كَـذَّابٌ,to Pharaoh and Hāmān and Korah but they said — that he was — ‘A sorcerer a mere liar!’
فَلَمَّا جَآءَهُمْ بِٱلْحَقِّ مِنْ عِندِنَا قَالُواْ ٱقْتُلُوۤاْ أَبْنَآءَ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ مَعَهُ وَٱسْتَحْيُواْ نِسَآءَهُمْ وَمَا كَـيْدُ ٱلْكَافِرِينَ إِلاَّ فِي ضَلاَلٍ,So when he brought them the truth from Us they said ‘Slay the sons of those who believe with him and spare keep alive their women’. But the guile of the disbelievers is ever in error in perdition.
وَقَالَ فِرْعَوْنُ ذَرُونِيۤ أَقْتُلْ مُوسَىٰ وَلْيَدْعُ رَبَّهُ إِنِّيۤ أَخَافُ أَن يُبَدِّلَ دِينَكُـمْ أَوْ أَن يُظْهِرَ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ ٱلْفَسَادَ,And Pharaoh said ‘Let me slay Moses — for they used to restrain him from slaying him — and let him call to his Lord to defend him against me. Indeed I fear that he may change your religion involving your worship of me so that you will then follow him in his religion or that he may cause corruption to appear in the land’ by initiating killing and otherwise a variant reading for wa-an ‘and that’ is aw-an ‘or that’; a variant reading for an yuzhira fī’l-ardi’l-fasāda is the impersonal construction an yazhara fī’l-ardi’l-fasādu ‘that corruption may appear in the land’.
وَقَالَ مُوسَىٰ إِنِّي عُذْتُ بِرَبِّي وَرَبِّكُـمْ مِّن كُلِّ مُتَكَبِّرٍ لاَّ يُؤْمِنُ بِيَوْمِ ٱلْحِسَابِ,And Moses said to his people after he had heard that saying of Pharaoh ‘Indeed I seek refuge in my Lord and your Lord from every arrogant one who does not believe in the Day of Reckoning’.
وَقَالَ رَجُلٌ مُّؤْمِنٌ مِّنْ آلِ فِرْعَوْنَ يَكْتُمُ إِيمَانَهُ أَتَقْتُلُونَ رَجُلاً أَن يَقُولَ رَبِّيَ ٱللَّهُ وَقَدْ جَآءَكُمْ بِٱلْبَيِّنَاتِ مِن رَّبِّكُمْ وَإِن يَكُ كَاذِباً فَعَلَيْهِ كَذِبُهُ وَإِن يَكُ صَادِقاً يُصِبْكُمْ بَعْضُ ٱلَّذِي يَعِدُكُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لاَ يَهْدِي مَنْ هُوَ مُسْرِفٌ كَذَّابٌ,Then said a believing man from among Pharaoh’s folk — this is said to have been his paternal cousin — who had concealed his faith ‘Will you slay a man for saying “My Lord is God” even though he has also brought you clear signs manifest miracles from your Lord? If he is lying then his mendacity will be to his own detriment that is the harm resulting from his mendacity will be to his own detriment; but if he is truthful then there will befall you some of that with which he is threatening you in the way of chastisement soon. Truly God does not guide one who is a prodigal an idolater a liar.
يٰقَومِ لَكُمُ ٱلْمُلْكُ ٱلْيَوْمَ ظَاهِرِينَ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ فَمَن يَنصُرُنَا مِن بَأْسِ ٱللَّهِ إِن جَآءَنَا قَالَ فِرْعَوْنُ مَآ أُرِيكُمْ إِلاَّ مَآ أَرَىٰ وَمَآ أَهْدِيكُمْ إِلاَّ سَبِيلَ ٱلرَّشَادِ,O my people! Today the kingdom is yours you are dominant prevailing zāhirīna a circumstantial qualifier in the land the land of Egypt. But who will help us against the might of God against His chastisement if you resolve to slay His friends should it reach us?’ In other words we would have no helper. Pharaoh said ‘I only point out to you what I see to be best that is to say I only suggest to you what I suggest to myself and that is to kill Moses would be best; and I am only guiding you to the path of rectitude’ to the correct way.
وَقَالَ ٱلَّذِيۤ آمَنَ يٰقَوْمِ إِنِّيۤ أَخَافُ عَلَيْكُمْ مِّثْلَ يَوْمِ ٱلأَحْزَابِ,Then said he who believed ‘O my people! Truly I fear for you a day like the day of the factions in other words the day of one faction being destroyed after another;
مِثْلَ دَأْبِ قَوْمِ نُوحٍ وَعَادٍ وَثَمُودَ وَٱلَّذِينَ مِن بَعْدِهِمْ وَمَا ٱللَّهُ يُرِيدُ ظُلْماً لِّلْعِبَادِ,like the case of the people of Noah and ‘Ād and Thamūd and those who came after them mithla ‘like’ substitutes for the previous mithla ‘like’ in other words the same requital as was customarily dealt to those who disbelieved before you of their being chastised in this world and God does not desire to wrong any of His servants.
وَيٰقَوْمِ إِنِّيۤ أَخَافُ عَلَيْكُمْ يَوْمَ ٱلتَّنَادِ,And O my people! Truly I fear for you a day of mutual calling read yawma’l-tanādi omitting the final long yā’ or retaining it thus yawma’l-tanādī that is to say the Day of Resurrection in which repeated calls are made by those meriting Paradise to those meriting the Fire and vice versa as well as calls proclaiming good fortune for those who merit the former and misery for those who merit the latter and many other such calls
يَوْمَ تُوَلُّونَ مُدْبِرِينَ مَا لَكُمْ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ مِنْ عَاصِمٍ وَمَن يُضْلِلِ ٱللَّهُ فَمَا لَهُ مِنْ هَادٍ,a day when you will turn back to flee from the site of the Reckoning leading to the Fire not having anyone to defend you to protect you from God in other words from His chastisement and whomever God leads astray for him there is no guide.
وَلَقَدْ جَآءَكُـمْ يُوسُفُ مِن قَبْلُ بِٱلْبَيِّنَاتِ فَمَا زِلْتُمْ فِي شَكٍّ مِّمَّا جَآءَكُـمْ بِهِ حَتَّىٰ إِذَا هَلَكَ قُلْتُمْ لَن يَبْعَثَ ٱللَّهُ مِن بَعْدِهِ رَسُولاً كَذَلِكَ يُضِلُّ ٱللَّهُ مَنْ هُوَ مُسْرِفٌ مُّرْتَابٌ,And verily Joseph brought you before in other words before Moses — according to one opinion this Joseph is the son of Jacob having been given life until the time of Moses; according to another opinion this is Joseph son of Abraham son of Joseph son of Jacob — clear signs manifest miracles but you continued to be in doubt concerning what he had brought you until when he died you said without any evidence to support such a claim “God will never send any messenger after him” — in other words you will never cease to disbelieve in Joseph and others that may come after him. So that is just as you have been led astray God leads astray one who is a prodigal an idolater a skeptic’ a doubter of that which the clear signs have certified.
ٱلَّذِينَ يُجَادِلُونَ فِيۤ آيَاتِ ٱللَّهِ بِغَيْرِ سُلْطَانٍ أَتَاهُمْ كَبُرَ مَقْتاً عِندَ ٱللَّهِ وَعِندَ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ كَذَلِكَ يَطْبَعُ ٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُـلِّ قَلْبِ مُتَكَبِّرٍ جَبَّارٍ,Those who dispute the signs of God His miracles alladhīna yujādilūna fī āyāti’Llāhi the subject without any warrant any evidence that has come to them — greatly hateful is that disputing of theirs kabura the predicate of the subject in the sight of God and in the sight of those who believe. So just as they have been led astray God sets a seal of misguidance on the heart of every arrogant tyrant read qalbin ‘the heart of’ with nunation or without qalbi. As the heart grows arrogant so does the individual and vice versa kulli in both readings is meant to indicate the totality of the misguidance of such hearts not the totality of the hearts.
وَقَالَ فَرْعَوْنُ يٰهَامَانُ ٱبْنِ لِي صَرْحاً لَّعَـلِّيۤ أَبْلُغُ ٱلأَسْبَابَ,And Pharaoh said ‘O Hāmān! Build for me a tower a lofty edifice that perhaps I may reach the routes —
أَسْبَابَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ فَأَطَّلِعَ إِلَىٰ إِلَـٰهِ مُوسَىٰ وَإِنِّي لأَظُنُّهُ كَاذِباً وَكَـذَلِكَ زُيِّنَ لِفِرْعَوْنَ سُوۤءُ عَمَلِهِ وَصُدَّ عَنِ ٱلسَّبِيلِ وَمَا كَـيْدُ فِرْعَوْنَ إِلاَّ فِي تَبَابٍ,the routes of the heavens — the paths that lead to it and look upon read indicative fa-attali‘u as a supplement to ablughu ‘I may reach’; or read subjunctive fa-attali‘a as the response to ibni lī ‘build for me’ the God of Moses; for I truly think that he that is Moses is lying’ about his having a god other than me — Pharaoh said this in order to disguise the truth. And that is how the evil nature of his conduct was made to seem fair to Pharaoh and that is how he was barred from the right way the path to guidance read sadda ‘that is how he barred others’ or sudda ‘that is how he was barred’. And Pharaoh’s guile ended only in ruin loss.
وَقَالَ ٱلَّذِيۤ آمَنَ يٰقَوْمِ ٱتَّبِعُونِ أَهْدِكُـمْ سَبِيـلَ ٱلرَّشَـادِ,And he who believed ‘O my people! Follow me read ittabi‘ūnī with the final long yā’ or ittabi‘ūni without; I will guide you to the way of rectitude a similar statement has already been mentioned verse 29 above.
يٰقَوْمِ إِنَّمَا هَـٰذِهِ ٱلْحَيَاةُ ٱلدُّنْيَا مَتَاعٌ وَإِنَّ ٱلآخِرَةَ هِيَ دَارُ ٱلْقَـرَارِ,O my people! Truly this life of the world is only an ephemeral enjoyment containing comforts which will eventually disappear whereas the Hereafter truly is the enduring abode.
مَنْ عَمِـلَ سَـيِّئَةً فَلاَ يُجْزَىٰ إِلاَّ مِثْلَهَا وَمَنْ عَمِـلَ صَالِحاً مِّن ذَكَـرٍ أَوْ أُنْثَىٰ وَهُوَ مُؤْمِنٌ فَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ يَدْخُلُونَ ٱلْجَنَّةَ يُرْزَقُونَ فِيهَا بِغَيْرِ حِسَابٍ,Whoever commits an evil deed shall not be requited except with the like of it; but whoever acts righteously whether male or female and is a believer — such shall be admitted into Paradise read passive yudkhalūna or the opposite active yadkhulūna ‘they shall enter’ wherein they will be provided without any reckoning an abundant provision given to them unconditionally.
وَيٰقَوْمِ مَا لِيۤ أَدْعُوكُـمْ إِلَى ٱلنَّجَاةِ وَتَدْعُونَنِيۤ إِلَى ٱلنَّارِ,And O my people! Think what makes me call you to deliverance when you call me to the Fire?
تَدْعُونَنِي لأَكْـفُرَ بِٱللَّهِ وَأُشْرِكَ بِهِ مَا لَيْسَ لِي بِهِ عِلْمٌ وَأَنَاْ أَدْعُوكُمْ إِلَى ٱلْعَزِيزِ ٱلْغَفَّارِ,You call me to disbelieve in God and to associate with Him that whereof I have no knowledge whereas I call you to the Mighty Whose way always prevails the Forgiver to those who repent.
لاَ جَرَمَ أَنَّمَا تَدْعُونَنِيۤ إِلَيْهِ لَيْسَ لَهُ دَعْوَةٌ فِي ٱلدُّنْيَا وَلاَ فِي ٱلآخِرَةِ وَأَنَّ مَرَدَّنَآ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ وَأَنَّ ٱلْمُسْرِفِينَ هُمْ أَصْحَابُ ٱلنَّارِ,No doubt verily that to which you call me to worship has no call that is heard in other words has no call answered in this world or in the Hereafter and indeed our return will be to God and indeed the prodigal the disbelievers it is they who will be the inhabitants of the Fire.
فَسَتَذْكُرُونَ مَآ أَقُولُ لَكُـمْ وَأُفَوِّضُ أَمْرِيۤ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ بَصِيرٌ بِٱلْعِبَادِ,For you will soon remember what I have said to you when you see the chastisement with your own eyes. And I entrust my affair to God. Truly God is Seer of His servants’ — he said this after they threatened him with retribution for opposing their religion.
فَوقَاهُ ٱللَّهُ سَيِّئَاتِ مَا مَكَـرُواْ وَحَاقَ بِآلِ فِرْعَوْنَ سُوۤءُ ٱلْعَذَابِ,So God shielded him from the evils of what they had plotted against him in the way of killing him and there besieged befell the folk of Pharaoh his people as well as him a dreadful chastisement drowning
ٱلنَّارُ يُعْرَضُونَ عَلَيْهَا غُدُوّاً وَعَشِيّاً وَيَوْمَ تَقُومُ ٱلسَّاعَةُ أَدْخِلُوۤاْ آلَ فِرْعَوْنَ أَشَدَّ ٱلْعَذَابِ,then the Fire to which they are exposed in which they are burnt morning and evening. And on the day when the Hour comes it will be said ‘Enter O folk of Pharaoh a variant reading for udkhulū ‘enter’ has adkhilū ‘admit’ being a command to the angels the most awful chastisement!’ the chastisement of Hell.
وَإِذْ يَتَحَآجُّونَ فِي ٱلنَّـارِ فَيَقُولُ ٱلضُّعَفَاءُ لِلَّذِينَ ٱسْتَكْـبَرُوۤاْ إِنَّا كُنَّا لَكُمْ تَبَعاً فَهَلْ أَنتُم مُّغْنُونَ عَنَّا نَصِيباً مِّنَ ٱلنَّارِ,And mention when they will be arguing when they the disbelievers will be disputing with one another in the Fire and the weak will say to those who were arrogant ‘Indeed we were your followers taba‘an is the plural of tābi‘; so will you now avail will you defend us against any portion of the Fire?’
قَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱسْتَكْبَرُوۤاْ إِنَّا كُلٌّ فِيهَآ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ قَدْ حَكَمَ بَيْنَ ٱلْعِبَادِ,Those who were arrogant will say ‘Indeed we are all together in it. God has indeed judged fairly between His servants’ admitting believers into Paradise and disbelievers into the Fire.
وَقَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ فِي ٱلنَّارِ لِخَزَنَةِ جَهَنَّمَ ٱدْعُواْ رَبَّكُمْ يُخَفِّفْ عَنَّا يَوْماً مِّنَ ٱلْعَذَابِ,And those who are in the Fire will say to the keepers of Hell ‘Call on your Lord that He relieve us of at least a day in other words the equivalent of one day of the chastisement!’
قَالُوۤاْ أَوَلَمْ تَكُ تَأْتِيكُمْ رُسُلُكُمْ بِٱلْبَيِّنَاتِ قَالُواْ بَلَىٰ قَالُواْ فَٱدْعُواْ وَمَا دُعَاءُ ٱلْكَافِرِينَ إِلاَّ فِي ضَلاَلٍ,They that is the keepers will say mockingly ‘Did not your messengers bring you clear signs?’ manifest miracles? They will say ‘Yes indeed’ — in other words they disbelieved them. They will say ‘Then supplicate God!’ yourselves for we do not intercede for disbelievers. God exalted be He says but the supplications of the disbelievers can only be misguided void.
إِنَّا لَنَنصُرُ رُسُلَنَا وَٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ فِي ٱلْحَيَاةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَيَوْمَ يَقُومُ ٱلأَشْهَادُ,Truly We shall help Our messengers and those who believe in the life of this world and on the day when the witnesses rise up ashhād is the plural of shāhid — these are the angels who will testify in support of the messengers that they indeed delivered their Messages and against the disbelievers that they denied them;
يَوْمَ لاَ يَنفَعُ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ مَعْذِرَتُهُمْ وَلَهُمُ ٱلْلَّعْنَةُ وَلَهُمْ سُوۤءُ ٱلدَّارِ,the day when their excuses will not benefit read lā yanfa‘u or lā tanfa‘u the evildoers even if they were to offer them and theirs will be the curse in other words the banishment from God’s Mercy and theirs will be the ills of the ultimate abode in the Hereafter meaning the most severe of its chastisements.
وَلَقَدْ آتَيْنَا مُوسَى ٱلْهُدَىٰ وَأَوْرَثْنَا بَنِيۤ إِسْرَائِيلَ ٱلْكِتَابَ,And verily We gave Moses the guidance the Torah and miracles and We made the Children of Israel after Moses heirs to the scripture the Torah
هُدًى وَذِكْرَىٰ لأُوْلِي ٱلأَلْبَابِ,as a guidance to guide and as a remembrance for people of pith a reminder for possessors of intellect.
فَٱصْبِرْ إِنَّ وَعْدَ ٱللَّهِ حَقٌّ وَٱسْتَغْفِـرْ لِذَنبِكَ وَسَبِّحْ بِحَمْدِ رَبِّكَ بِٱلْعَشِيِّ وَٱلإِبْكَارِ,So be patient O Muhammad (s). Surely God’s promise to grant victory to His friends is true — for you and whoever follows you are among such friends. And ask forgiveness for your sin so that you will be emulated in this by your community and glorify perform prayer continuously with praise of your Lord at night — which means after sunset — and in the early hours the five prayers.
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يُجَادِلُونَ فِيۤ آيَاتِ ٱللَّهِ بِغَيْرِ سُلْطَانٍ أَتَاهُمْ إِن فِي صُدُورِهِمْ إِلاَّ كِبْرٌ مَّـا هُم بِبَالِغِيهِ فَٱسْتَعِذْ بِٱللَّهِ إِنَّـهُ هُوَ ٱلسَّمِيعُ ٱلْبَصِيرُ,Truly those who dispute the signs of God the Qur’ān without any warrant any evidence that has come to them — there is only vanity in their breasts only arrogance and an evil desire to get the better of you which they will never attain and satisfy. So seek refuge with God from their evil. Surely He is the Hearer of their sayings the Seer of their state.
لَخَلْقُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ أَكْـبَرُ مِنْ خَلْقِ ٱلنَّاسِ وَلَـٰكِنَّ أَكْـثَرَ ٱلنَّاسِ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ,The following was revealed regarding the deniers of resurrection Assuredly the creation of the heavens and the earth as an unprecedented first act is greater than the creation of mankind a second time — which is the restoration of them after death; but most people namely the disbelievers of Mecca do not know this and so they are like the blind whereas those who know it are like those who have sight.
وَمَا يَسْتَوِي ٱلأَعْـمَىٰ وَٱلْبَصِيرُ وَٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ وَلاَ ٱلْمُسِيۤءُ قَلِيـلاً مَّا تَتَذَكَّرُونَ,And the blind one and the seer are not equal; nor are they equal those who believe and perform righteous deeds — such a person being the virtuous one — and the evildoer wa-lā’l-musī’u lā here is extra. Little do they reflect little are they admonished read yatadhakkarūna or second person plural tatadhakkarūna ‘do you reflect’ in other words their reflections are very few.
إِنَّ ٱلسَّاعَةَ لآتِيَـةٌ لاَّ رَيْبَ فِيهَا وَلَـٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ ٱلنَّاسِ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ,Truly the Hour is coming; there is no doubt in it. But most people do not believe in it.
وَقَالَ رَبُّكُـمُ ٱدْعُونِيۤ أَسْتَجِبْ لَكُمْ إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يَسْتَكْبِرُونَ عَنْ عِبَادَتِي سَيَدْخُلُونَ جَهَنَّمَ دَاخِرِينَ,And your Lord has said ‘Call on Me and I will respond to you in other words worship Me and I will reward you — judging this to be the meaning by what follows. Surely those who disdain to worship Me shall enter sa-yadkhulūna or passive sa-yudkhalūna ‘they shall be admitted into’ Hell utterly humiliated’ abased.
ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِي جَعَلَ لَكُمُ ٱللَّيْلَ لِتَسْكُنُواْ فِيهِ وَٱلنَّهَـارَ مُبْصِـراً إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَذُو فَضْلٍ عَلَى ٱلنَّاسِ وَلَـٰكِنَّ أَكْـثَرَ ٱلنَّاسِ لاَ يَشْكُرُونَ,God it is Who made for you night that you may rest in it and day for seeing — the attribution of sight ibsār to ‘day’ is figurative and it is so attributed because one is able to see in it. Surely God is a Lord of bounty to mankind but most people are not thankful to God and so they do not believe.
ذَٰلِكُمُ ٱللَّهُ رَبُّكُمْ خَـٰلِقُ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ لاَّ إِلَـٰهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ فَأَنَّىٰ تُؤْفَكُونَ,That then is God your Lord the Creator of all things; there is no god except Him. How then are you made to deviate? how then are you turned away from faith despite the evidence having been established for it?
كَذَلِكَ يُؤْفَكُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَانُواْ بِآيَاتِ ٱللَّهِ يَجْحَدُونَ,So deviate that is in the same way that these Meccans deviate deviate those who used to deny the signs of God His miracles.
ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِي جَعَـلَ لَكُـمُ ٱلأَرْضَ قَـرَاراً وَٱلسَّمَآءَ بِنَـآءً وَصَوَّرَكُـمْ فَأَحْسَنَ صُوَرَكُـمْ وَرَزَقَكُـمْ مِّنَ ٱلطَّيِّبَاتِ ذَلِكُمُ ٱللَّهُ رَبُّكُـمْ فَتَـبَارَكَ ٱللَّهُ رَبُّ ٱلْعَالَمِينَ,God it is Who made for you the earth as a stable abode and the heaven as a canopy a ceiling. And He formed you and perfected your forms and provided you with all the wholesome things. That then is God your Lord so blessed be God the Lord of the Worlds.
هُوَ ٱلْحَيُّ لاَ إِلَـٰهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ فَـٱدْعُوهُ مُخْلِصِينَ لَهُ ٱلدِّينَ ٱلْحَـمْدُ للَّهِ رَبِّ ٱلْعَالَمِينَ,He is the Living; there is no god except Him. So supplicate Him worship Him devoting your religion purely to Him free from any idolatry. Praise be to God the Lord of the Worlds.
قُلْ إِنِّي نُهِيتُ أَنْ أَعْبُدَ ٱلَّذِينَ تَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ لَمَّا جَآءَنِيَ ٱلْبَيِّنَـٰتُ مِن رَّبِّي وَأُمِرْتُ أَنْ أُسْلِمَ لِرَبِّ ٱلْعَـٰلَمِينَ,Say ‘I have been forbidden to worship those on whom you call those whom you worship besides God since there have come to me clear signs proofs of His Oneness from my Lord; and I have been commanded to submit to the Lord of the Worlds’.
هُوَ ٱلَّذِي خَلَقَكُمْ مِّن تُرَابٍ ثُمَّ مِن نُّطْفَةٍ ثُمَّ مِنْ عَلَقَةٍ ثُمَّ يُخْرِجُكُمْ طِفْلاً ثُمَّ لِتَـبْلُغُوۤاْ أَشُدَّكُـمْ ثُمَّ لِتَكُـونُواْ شُيُوخاً وَمِنكُمْ مَّن يُتَوَفَّىٰ مِن قَبْلُ وَلِتَبْلُغُوۤاْ أَجَلاً مُّسَمًّى وَلَعَلَّـكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ,He it is Who created you from dust by having created your father Adam from it then from a drop of sperm then from a blood-clot congealed blood then He brings you forth as infants then He sustains you that you may come of age until you have attained your full strength — this being from the age of thirty to forty — then that you may become aged read shuyūkhan or shiyūkhan— though there are some of you who die earlier that is before coming of age or becoming aged. He does this to you so that you may live on and that you may complete an appointed term a defined length of time that perhaps you might understand the proofs of His Oneness and thus become believers.
هُوَ ٱلَّذِي يُحْيِـي وَيُمِيتُ فَإِذَا قَضَىٰ أَمْراً فَإِنَّمَا يَقُولُ لَهُ كُن فيَكُونُ,He it is Who gives life and brings death. So when He decides upon a matter when He wants to bring something into existence He only says to it ‘Be!’ and it is read fa-yakūnu or fa-yakūna in the subjunctive on account of an implied preceding an. In other words it comes into existence after He has willed it that which is signified by the said words.
أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى ٱلَّذِينَ يُجَادِلُونَ فِيۤ آيَاتِ ٱللَّهِ أَنَّىٰ يُصْرَفُونَ,Have you not regarded those who dispute the signs of God the Qur’ān how they are turned away? from faith —
ٱلَّذِينَ كَذَّبُواْ بِٱلْكِـتَابِ وَبِمَآ أَرْسَلْنَا بِهِ رُسُلَنَا فَسَوْفَ يَعْلَمُونَ,those who deny the Book the Qur’ān and that wherewith We have sent Our messengers in the way of the affirmation of God’s Oneness and belief in the Resurrection — and these deniers are the Meccan disbelievers. But they will come to know the punishment for their denials;
إِذِ ٱلأَغْلاَلُ فِيۤ أَعْنَاقِهِمْ وٱلسَّلاَسِلُ يُسْحَبُونَ,when idh has the meaning of idhā with fetters around their necks and chains wa’l-salāsilu a supplement to al-aghlālu ‘fetters’ so that the meaning is that these chains are also around their necks; or it al-salāsilu ‘chains’ is the subject the predicate of which has been omitted in other words the meaning being around their feet will be these chains — or alternatively its predicate is the following yushabūna they are dragged in other words they are dragged away by these chains.
فِي ٱلْحَمِيمِ ثُمَّ فِي ٱلنَّارِ يُسْجَرُونَ,into the boiling water that is into Hell then in the Fire they are set aflame.
ثُمَّ قِيلَ لَهُمْ أَيْنَ مَا كُنتُمْ تُشْرِكُونَ,Then it will be said to them in reproach ‘Where are those whom you used to make partners
مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ قَـالُواْ ضَـلُّواْ عَنَّا بَل لَّمْ نَكُنْ نَّدْعُواْ مِن قَبْلُ شَيْئاً كَذَلِكَ يُضِلُّ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْكَافِرِينَ,besides God?’ alongside Him and these are the idols. They will say ‘They have forsaken abandoned us and so we cannot see them. Nay but actually we were not invoking anything before’. They deny that they used to worship these idols; but then these idols are brought before them — which is where God exalted be He says ‘Truly you and what you worship besides God shall be fuel for Hell’ Q. 2198. So in the same way that these disbelievers have been led astray God leads astray the disbelievers.
ذَلِكُمْ بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَفْرَحُونَ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ بِغَيْرِ ٱلْحَقِّ وَبِمَا كُنتُمْ تَمْرَحُونَ,And it will also be said to them ‘That chastisement is because you used to exult in the earth without right by your idolatry and denial of resurrection and because you were insolent committing acts of disobedience in abundance.
ٱدْخُلُوۤاْ أَبْوَابَ جَهَنَّمَ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا فَبِئْسَ مَثْوَى ٱلْمُتَكَبِّرِينَ,Enter the gates of Hell to abide therein’. Evil then is the ultimate abode of the arrogant!
فَٱصْبِرْ إِنَّ وَعْدَ ٱللَّهِ حَقٌّ فَـإِمَّا نُرِيَنَّكَ بَعْضَ ٱلَّذِي نَعِدُهُمْ أَوْ نَتَوَفَّيَنَّكَ فَإِلَيْنَا يُرْجَعُونَ,So be patient. Assuredly God’s promise to chastise them is true. And if We show you fa-immā contains an assimilated conditional particle in; the mā is extra and emphasises the conditional import at the beginning of the verb while the nūn emphasises it at the end a part of what We promise them of chastisement in your lifetime the response to the conditional has been omitted in other words it is something like ‘then so be it!’ … or We take you unto Us in death before their chastisement then in any case to Us they will be returned whereupon We shall chastise them with the most severe punishment this last mentioned response is that of the supplement only.
وَلَقَدْ أَرْسَلْنَا رُسُلاً مِّن قَبْلِكَ مِنْهُم مَّن قَصَصْنَا عَلَيْكَ وَمِنْهُمْ مَّن لَّمْ نَقْصُصْ عَلَيْكَ وَمَا كَانَ لِرَسُولٍ أَن يَأْتِيَ بِآيَةٍ إِلاَّ بِإِذْنِ ٱللَّهِ فَإِذَا جَـآءَ أَمْرُ ٱللَّهِ قُضِيَ بِٱلْحَقِّ وَخَسِرَ هُنَالِكَ ٱلْمُبْطِلُونَ,And verily We sent messengers before you. Of them are those whom We have recounted to you and of them are those whom We have not recounted to you it is reported that God exalted be He sent 8000 prophets 4000 prophets sent from among the Children of Israel and the other 4000 from among the remainder of mankind. And it was never permitted for any messenger from among them to bring a sign except with God’s permission for they are also servants enthralled by Him. Hence when God’s command comes for the chastisement to be sent down on the disbelievers judgement between the messengers and their deniers is passed justly; and it is thence that the advocates of falsehood become losers that is to say it is thence that the judgement and the loss become manifest for mankind although such advocates of falsehood will have always been losers always before that.
ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِي جَعَلَ لَكُمُ ٱلأَنْعَامَ لِتَرْكَـبُواْ مِنْهَا وَمِنْهَا تَأْكُلُونَ,God it is Who made for you cattle — it is said that ‘camels’ are specifically meant here even though it seems to signify cows and sheep also — that you may ride some of them and eat of some.
وَلَكُمْ فِيهَا مَنَافِعُ وَلِتَـبْلُغُواْ عَلَيْهَا حَاجَةً فِي صُدُورِكُمْ وَعَلَيْهَا وَعَلَى ٱلْفُلْكِ تُحْمَلُونَ,And there are other uses for you in them such as their milk offspring fur and wool and that by them you may satisfy any need that is in your breasts namely to transport heavy loads to other lands and on them on land and on the ships in the sea you are carried.
وَيُرِيكُمْ آيَاتِهِ فَأَيَّ آيَاتِ ٱللَّهِ تُنكِرُونَ,And He shows you His signs. So which of God’s signs that is the signs that prove His Oneness do you reject? the interrogative here is meant as a rebuke; ayya ‘which of’ is more commonly made masculine than feminine.
أَفَلَمْ يَسِيرُواْ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ فَيَنظُرُواْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَاقِبَةُ ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ كَانُوۤاْ أَكْـثَرَ مِنْهُمْ وَأَشَدَّ قُوَّةً وَآثَاراً فِي ٱلأَرْضِ فَمَآ أَغْنَىٰ عَنْهُم مَّا كَانُواْ يَكْسِبُونَ,Have they not travelled across the land to see the nature of the consequence for those before them? They were more powerful than them in might and in their vestiges on earth in the way of large structures and palaces. But what they used to earn did not avail them.
فَلَمَّا جَآءَتْهُمْ رُسُلُهُم بِٱلْبَيِّنَاتِ فَرِحُواْ بِمَا عِندَهُمْ مِّنَ ٱلْعِلْمِ وَحَاقَ بِهِم مَّا كَانُواْ بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِئُونَ,And when their messengers brought them clear signs manifest miracles they the disbelievers exulted in the knowledge they the messengers possessed an exultation that entailed mockery and amusement as they rejected such knowledge and there besieged befell them that which they used to deride namely the chastisement.
فَلَمَّا رَأَوْاْ بَأْسَنَا قَالُوۤاْ آمَنَّا بِٱللَّهِ وَحْدَهُ وَكَـفَرْنَا بِمَا كُنَّا بِهِ مُشْرِكِينَ,Then when they saw Our doom that is the severity of Our chastisement they said ‘We believe in God alone and we disavow what we used to associate with Him’.
فَلَمْ يَكُ يَنفَعُهُمْ إِيمَانُهُمْ لَمَّا رَأَوْاْ بَأْسَنَا سُنَّتَ ٱللَّهِ ٱلَّتِي قَدْ خَلَتْ فِي عِبَادِهِ وَخَسِرَ هُنَالِكَ ٱلْكَافِرُونَ,But their faith was of no benefit to them when they saw Our doom — This is God’s way sunnata’Llāhi is in the accusative because it functions as a verbal noun from an implicit verb of the same expression with the believers among all communities which is that faith is of no benefit to them once the chastisement has been sent down which has its precdent; and it is thence that the disbelievers will be losers — it is thence that their status as losers will become apparent to all of mankind even though they will have always been losers before that.
حـمۤ,Hā mīm God knows best what He means by these letters.
تَنزِيلٌ مِّنَ ٱلرَّحْمَـٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ,A revelation from the Compassionate the Merciful tanzīlun mina’l-rahmāni’l-rahīm the subject.
كِتَابٌ فُصِّلَتْ آيَاتُهُ قُرْآناً عَرَبِيّاً لِّقَوْمٍ يَعْلَمُونَ,A Book kitābun the predicate thereof whose signs have been set out in detail whose signs have been expounded through various rulings stories and admonitions as an Arabic Qur’ān qur’ānan ‘arabiyyan a circumstantial qualifier referring to kitābun ‘a Book’ by qualifying it adjectivally for a people li-qawmin is semantically connected to fussilat ‘set out in detail’ who have knowledge who understand this fact — and they are the Arabs;
بَشِيراً وَنَذِيراً فَأَعْرَضَ أَكْثَرُهُمْ فَهُمْ لاَ يَسْمَعُونَ,containing good tidings bashīran is an adjective describing qur’ānan ‘a Qur’ān’ and a warning. But most of them turn away so that they do not hear in a way so as to accept its message.
وَقَالُواْ قُلُوبُنَا فِيۤ أَكِنَّةٍ مِمَّا تَدْعُونَا إِلَيْهِ وَفِي آذانِنَا وَقْرٌ وَمِن بَيْنِنَا وَبَيْنِكَ حِجَابٌ فَٱعْمَلْ إِنَّنَا عَامِلُونَ,And they say to the Prophet ‘Our hearts are veiled they are masked from that to which you call us and in our ears there is a deafness and between us and you there is a partition a variance over religion so act according to your religion; indeed we shall be acting!’ according to our religion.
قُلْ إِنَّمَآ أَنَاْ بَشَرٌ مِّثْلُكُمْ يُوحَىٰ إِلَيَّ أَنَّمَآ إِلَـٰهُكُمْ إِلَـٰهٌ وَاحِدٌ فَٱسْتَقِيمُوۤاْ إِلَيْهِ وَٱسْتَغْفِرُوهُ وَوَيْلٌ لِّلْمُشْرِكِينَ,Say ‘I am only a human being like you. It has been revealed to me simply that your God is One God. So be upright in your conduct before Him through faith and obedience and seek forgiveness from Him. And woe waylun is an expression implying ‘chastisement’ to the idolaters
ٱلَّذِينَ لاَ يُؤْتُونَ ٱلزَّكَاةَ وَهُمْ بِٱلآخِرَةِ هُمْ كَافِرُونَ,who do not pay the alms and who are disbelievers in the Hereafter the repetition of hum ‘they’ is for emphasis.
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ لَهُمْ أَجْرٌ غَيْرُ مَمْنُونٍ,Indeed those who believe and perform righteous deeds shall have an enduring reward’ one that is unceasing.
قُلْ أَإِنَّكُمْ لَتَكْفُرُونَ بِٱلَّذِي خَلَقَ ٱلأَرْضَ فِي يَوْمَيْنِ وَتَجْعَلُونَ لَهُ أَندَاداً ذَلِكَ رَبُّ ٱلْعَالَمِينَ,Say ‘Do you really read a-innakum pronouncing both hamzas or by not pronouncing the second one but inserting an alif between the two in both cases disbelieve in Him Who created the earth in two days Sunday and Monday and ascribe to Him associates? That is the Lord in other words the Possesser of all the Worlds al-‘ālamīn the plural of ‘ālam which denotes everything apart from God. On account of the variety of beings that it subsumes it has been expressed in the plural form ending with –īn as a way of giving prevalence in the address to rational beings.
وَجَعَلَ فِيهَا رَوَاسِيَ مِن فَوْقِهَا وَبَارَكَ فِيهَا وَقَدَّرَ فِيهَآ أَقْوَاتَهَا فِيۤ أَرْبَعَةِ أَيَّامٍ سَوَآءً لِّلسَّآئِلِينَ,And He set wa-ja‘ala the beginning of a new independent sentence and cannot be a supplement to the preceding relative clause containing alladhī ‘Who’ because of the intervening clause that is syntactically unrelated therein firm mountains rising above it and blessed it with an abundance of water crops and stock and ordained divided therein its various means of sustenance for human beings and beasts in four complete days — in other words the ‘setting therein of mountains’ together with what has been mentioned in addition all took place on Tuesday and Wednesday — evenly sawā’an in the accusative because it is a verbal noun in other words the four days were exactly four neither less nor more for all enquirers about the creation of the earth and all that is in it.
ثُمَّ ٱسْتَوَىٰ إِلَى ٱلسَّمَآءِ وَهِيَ دُخَانٌ فَقَالَ لَهَا وَلِلأَرْضِ ٱئْتِيَا طَوْعاً أَوْ كَرْهاً قَالَتَآ أَتَيْنَا طَآئِعِينَ,Then He turned to the heaven when it was smoke consisting of rising vapours and He said to it and to the earth “Come both of you to what I desire from you willingly or unwillingly!” taw‘an aw karhan their syntactical locus is that of a circumstantial qualifier in other words ‘Come being obedient or coerced’. They said “We come together with all those inhabiting us willingly!” tā’i‘īna mainly indicates masculine rational beings; it may also be that they are referred to in this way because they are being addressed thus.
فَقَضَٰهُنَّ سَبْعَ سَمَٰوَٰتٍ فِي يَوْمَيْنِ وَأَوْحَىٰ فِي كُلِّ سَمَآءٍ أَمْرَهَا وَزَيَّنَّا ٱلسَّمَآءَ ٱلدُّنْيَا بِمَصَٰبِيحَ وَحِفْظاً ذَلِكَ تَقْدِيرُ ٱلْعَزِيزِ ٱلْعَلِيمِ,Then He ordained them the suffixed pronoun refers back to al-samā’ ‘the heaven’ because it al-samā’ actually denotes that plural sense to which it will lead in the following clause in other words He made them to be seven heavens in two days — Thursday and Friday. He completed them in the last hour thereof in which He created Adam — which is why He does not say sawā’an ‘evenly’ here as He did earlier; what is said here concords with those verse in which it is stated that the heavens and the earth were created in six days; and in each heaven He revealed its commandment’ that to which He commanded those in it to follow in the way of obedience and worship. And We adorned the lowest heaven with lamps with stars and this was also to guard them hifzan is in the accusative because of its implicit verbal sense in other words ‘We guarded it against the devils lest they try to listen therein to the angels by stealth with meteors’. That is the ordaining of the Mighty in His kingdom the Knower of His creatures.
فَإِنْ أَعْرَضُواْ فَقُلْ أَنذَرْتُكُمْ صَاعِقَةً مِّثْلَ صَاعِقَةِ عَادٍ وَثَمُودَ,But if they that is the Meccan disbelievers turn away from belief after this clear statement then say ‘I warn you of I threaten you with a thunderbolt like the thunderbolt of ‘Ād and Thamūd’ in other words a chastisement that will destroy you like the one that destroyed them.
إِذْ جَآءَتْهُمُ ٱلرُّسُلُ مِن بَيْنِ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمِنْ خَلْفِهِمْ أَلاَّ تَعْبُدُوۤاْ إِلاَّ ٱللَّهَ قَالُواْ لَوْ شَآءَ رَبُّنَا لأَنزَلَ مَلاَئِكَةً فَإِنَّا بِمَآ أُرْسِلْتُمْ بِهِ كَافِرُونَ,When the messengers came to them from in front of them and from behind them that is coming to them to warn them and leaving them behind as they departed but they disbelieved as will be stated shortly — the destruction of them meant would only take place in his time — saying ‘Worship none but God’ they said ‘Had our Lord willed He would have surely sent down to us angels; therefore we indeed disbelieve in what you according to your claim have been sent with!’
فَأَمَّا عَادٌ فَٱسْتَكْبَرُواْ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ بِغَيْرِ ٱلْحَقِّ وَقَالُواْ مَنْ أَشَدُّ مِنَّا قُوَّةً أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْاْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ ٱلَّذِي خَلَقَهُمْ هُوَ أَشَدُّ مِنْهُمْ قُوَّةً وَكَانُواْ بِآيَاتِنَا يَجْحَدُونَ,As for ‘Ād they acted arrogantly in the earth without right and they said upon their being threatened with the chastisement ‘Who is more powerful than us in might?’ in other words they believed no one to be so — a single man among them could pull out a huge rock from a mountainside and have the strength to place it wherever he wished. Did they not see did they not realise that God He Who created them was more powerful than them in might? And they used to deny Our signs the miracles We sent down.
فَأَرْسَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ رِيحاً صَرْصَراً فِيۤ أَيَّامٍ نَّحِسَاتٍ لِّنُذِيقَهُمْ عَذَابَ ٱلْخِزْيِ فِي ٱلْحَيَاةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَلَعَذَابُ ٱلآخِرَةِ أَخْزَىٰ وَهُمْ لاَ يُنصَرُونَ,So We unleashed upon them a raging wind cold and violent but without rain during some ill-fated days read nahisātin or nahsātin days that were calamitous for them that We might make them taste the chastisement of disgrace humiliation in the life of this world; yet the chastisement of the Hereafter is indeed more disgraceful more severe and they will not be helped to have it warded off from them.
وَأَمَّا ثَمُودُ فَهَدَيْنَاهُمْ فَٱسْتَحَبُّواْ ٱلْعَمَىٰ عَلَى ٱلْهُدَىٰ فَأَخَذَتْهُمْ صَاعِقَةُ ٱلْعَذَابِ ٱلْهُونِ بِمَا كَانُواْ يَكْسِبُونَ,And as for Thamūd We offered them guidance We pointed out to them the path of guidance but they preferred blindness they chose disbelief as opposed to guidance. So the thunderbolt of the humiliating chastisement seized them on account of what they used to earn.
وَنَجَّيْنَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَكَانُواْ يتَّقُونَ,And We delivered from it those who believed and feared God.
وَيَوْمَ يُحْشَرُ أَعْدَآءُ ٱللَّهِ إِلَى ٱلنَّارِ فَهُمْ يُوزَعُونَ,And mention the day when God’s enemies are gathered read either yuhsharu a‘dā’u’Llāhi or nahshuru a‘dā’a’Llāhi ‘when We gather God’s enemies’ to the Fire for they will be driven thereto
حَتَّىٰ إِذَا مَا جَآءُوهَا شَهِدَ عَلَيْهِمْ سَمْعُهُمْ وَأَبْصَارُهُمْ وَجُلُودُهُم بِمَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ,until when they reach it idhā mā the mā is extra their hearing and their eyes and their skins will bear witness against them concerning what they used to do.
وَقَالُواْ لِجُلُودِهِمْ لِمَ شَهِدتُّمْ عَلَيْنَا قَالُوۤاْ أَنطَقَنَا ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِي أَنطَقَ كُلَّ شَيْءٍ وَهُوَ خَلَقَكُمْ أَوَّلَ مَرَّةٍ وَإِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ,And they will say to their skins ‘Why did you bear witness against us?’ They will say ‘God made us speak Who gave speech to all things in other words all things which He wanted to be able to speak. And He created you the first time and to Him you will be returned it is said that this statement is made by their skins; but it is also said to be God’s words as is the case with what follows for it is similar in context to what preceded namely that the One with the power to originate you without any precedent and restore you to life after death also has the power to make your skins and your limbs speak.
وَمَا كُنتُمْ تَسْتَتِرُونَ أَن يَشْهَدَ عَلَيْكُمْ سَمْعُكُمْ وَلاَ أَبْصَارُكُمْ وَلاَ جُلُودُكُمْ وَلَـٰكِن ظَنَنتُمْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ لاَ يَعْلَمُ كَثِيراً مِّمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ,And you did not use to conceal yourselves when you used to commit lewd acts lest your hearing or your eyes or your skins should bear witness against you because you were never certain about the truth of resurrection; but you thought when you used to conceal yourselves that God did not know most of what you did.
وَذَلِكُمْ ظَنُّكُمُ ٱلَّذِي ظَنَنتُم بِرَبِّكُمْ أَرْدَاكُمْ فَأَصْبَحْتُمْ مِّنَ ٱلُخَاسِرِينَ,And that wa-dhālikum the subject supposition of yours zannukum substitutes for it which you supposed of your Lord alladhī zanantum bi-rabbikum a descriptive clause; the predicate is the following ardākum has ruined you that is it has brought about your destruction. So you have become among the losers’.
فَإِن يَصْبِرُواْ فَٱلنَّارُ مَثْوًى لَّهُمْ وَإِن يَسْتَعْتِبُواْ فَمَا هُم مِّنَ ٱلْمُعْتَبِينَ,So if they endure the chastisement the Fire will still be their abode; and if they seek reconciliation if they seek the satisfaction of God then they will not be among the reconciled those deemed satisfactory by God.
وَقَيَّضْنَا لَهُمْ قُرَنَآءَ فَزَيَّنُواْ لَهُم مَّا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ وَحَقَّ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلْقَوْلُ فِيۤ أُمَمٍ قَدْ خَلَتْ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ مِّنَ ٱلْجِنِّ وَٱلإِنْسِ إِنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ خَاسِرِينَ,And We have assigned We have occasioned for them companions from among the devils who have adorned for them that which is before them of what concerns this world and the following after lusts and that which is behind them of what concerns the Hereafter when they make them say that there will be neither resurrection nor reckoning. And the word of chastisement — namely the verse Assuredly I will fill Hell … Q. 11119 — became due against them being among all those communities that passed away that were destroyed before them of jinn and mankind. Truly they were losers.
وَقَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لاَ تَسْمَعُواْ لِهَـٰذَا ٱلْقُرْآنِ وَٱلْغَوْاْ فِيهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَغْلِبُونَ,And those who disbelieve say during the Prophet’s s recitation of the Qur’ān ‘Do not listen to this Qur’ān and hoot it down make a din and so forth and clamour whenever he is reciting that perhaps you might prevail’ so that he will then desist from recitation.
فَلَنُذِيقَنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ عَذَاباً شَدِيداً وَلَنَجْزِيَنَّهُمْ أَسْوَأَ ٱلَّذِي كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ,God exalted be He says regarding them But verily We will make those who disbelieve taste a severe chastisement and We will verily requite them the worst of what they used to do in other words with the worst requital for their deeds.
ذَلِكَ جَزَآءُ أَعْدَآءِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلنَّارُ لَهُمْ فِيهَا دَارُ الخُلْدِ جَزَآءً بِمَا كَانُوا بِآياتِنَا يَجْحَدُونَ,That severe chastisement and worst requital is the requital of God’s enemies jazā’u a‘dā’i the second hamza may be pronounced fully or replaced with a wāw — the Fire! al-nāru an explicative supplement to jazā’u ‘the requital’ alluded to by the demonstrative dhālika ‘that’. Therein will be their everlasting abode that is as a place of permanent residence from which there will be no removal as a requital jazā’an is in the accusative as a verbal noun from the implicit verbal action for their denial of Our signs for their denial of the Qur’ān.
وَقَال الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ رَبَّنَآ أَرِنَا ٱلَّذَيْنِ أَضَلاَّنَا مِنَ ٱلْجِنِّ وَٱلإِنسِ نَجْعَلْهُمَا تَحْتَ أَقْدَامِنَا لِيَكُونَا مِنَ ٱلأَسْفَلِينَ,And those who disbelieve will say while in the Fire ‘Our Lord show us those who led us astray from among the jinn and mankind — namely Iblīs and Cain respectively both of whom established disbelief and slaying as something to be emulated — so that we may have them underneath our feet to trample them in the Fire that they may be among the lowermost’ in other words in a chastisement more severe than ours.
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ قَالُواْ رَبُّنَا ٱللَّهُ ثُمَّ ٱسْتَقَامُواْ تَتَنَزَّلُ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلْمَلاَئِكَةُ أَلاَّ تَخَافُواْ وَلاَ تَحْزَنُواْ وَأَبْشِرُواْ بِٱلْجَنَّةِ ٱلَّتِي كُنتُمْ تُوعَدُونَ,Truly those who say ‘Our Lord is God!’ and then remain upright adhering to the affirmation of God’s Oneness and to whatever else has been enjoined on them the angels descend upon them at the point of death saying to them ‘Do not fear death and what will come after it nor grieve for any family or children that you have left behind for we will look after them after you and rejoice in the good tidings of the paradise which you were promised.
نَحْنُ أَوْلِيَآؤُكُمْ فِي ٱلْحَيَاةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَفِي ٱلآخِرَةِ وَلَكُمْ فِيهَا مَا تَشْتَهِيۤ أَنفُسُكُمْ وَلَكُمْ فِيهَا مَا تَدَّعُونَ,We are your friends in the life of this world that is we will look after you in it and in the Hereafter in other words we will be alongside you thereat until you enter Paradise; and therein you will have whatever your souls desire and therein you will have whatever you request
نُزُلاً مِّنْ غَفُورٍ رَّحِيمٍ,as a hospitality a pre-prepared provision nuzulan is in the accusative because of an implied preceding verb ‘appointed for you’ from One Forgiving Merciful’ namely God.
وَمَنْ أَحْسَنُ قَوْلاً مِّمَّن دَعَآ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ وَعَمِلَ صَالِحاً وَقَالَ إِنَّنِي مِنَ ٱلْمُسْلِمِينَ,And who speaks better words — in other words no one speaks better words — than him who summons others to God by affirming His Oneness and acts righteously and says ‘Indeed I am one of those who submit to God’?
وَلاَ تَسْتَوِي ٱلْحَسَنَةُ وَلاَ ٱلسَّيِّئَةُ ٱدْفَعْ بِٱلَّتِي هِيَ أَحْسَنُ فَإِذَا ٱلَّذِي بَيْنَكَ وَبَيْنَهُ عَدَاوَةٌ كَأَنَّهُ وَلِيٌّ حَمِيمٌ,And they are not equal the good deed and the evil deed even with respect to their subdivisions because any number of such good deeds are always above any number of the latter. Repel the evil deed with that in other words with that trait which is better such as repelling anger with endurance ignorance with forbearance and the intention to inflict harm with pardon then behold he between whom and you there was enmity will be as though he were a dear friend in other words then your enemy will become like a close friend in terms of his affection for you if you act in such a way alladhī ‘he … whom’ is the subject; ka-annahu ‘as though’ is the predicate; idhā is an adverbial particle for expressing the comparative import.
وَمَا يُلَقَّاهَا إِلاَّ ٱلَّذِينَ صَبَرُواْ وَمَا يُلَقَّاهَآ إِلاَّ ذُو حَظٍّ عَظِيمٍ,But none is granted it in other words none is given that better trait except those who are steadfast; and none is granted it except one deserving of a great reward.
وَإِمَّا يَنزَغَنَّكَ مِنَ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنِ نَزْغٌ فَٱسْتَعِذْ بِٱللَّهِ إِنَّهُ هُوَ ٱلسَّمِيعُ ٱلْعَلِيمُ,And if wa-immā here the nūn of the conditional particle in has been assimilated with the mā which is extra some temptation from Satan should provoke you in other words if some diversion should turn you away from that better trait and other good acts then seek refuge in God this is the response to the conditional ‘and if’; the response to the command clause is omitted being ‘and He will ward it off from you’. Truly He is the Hearer of what is said the Knower of what is done.
وَمِنْ آيَاتِهِ ٱلَّيلُ وَٱلنَّهَارُ وَٱلشَّمْسُ وَٱلْقَمَرُ لاَ تَسْجُدُواْ لِلشَّمْسِ وَلاَ لِلْقَمَرِ وَٱسْجُدُواْ لِلَّهِ ٱلَّذِي خَلَقَهُنَّ إِن كُنتُمْ إِيَّاهُ تَعْبُدُونَ,And among His signs are the night and the day and the sun and the moon. Do not prostrate to the sun and moon but prostrate to God Who created them namely these fours signs if it is Him Whom you worship.
فَإِنِ ٱسْتَكْبَرُواْ فَٱلَّذِينَ عِندَ رَبِّكَ يُسَبِّحُونَ لَهُ بِٱلَّيْلِ وَٱلنَّهَارِ وَهُمْ لاَ يَسْئَمُونَ,But if they disdain to prostrate to God alone still those who are with your Lord that is to say still the angels glorify perform prayers to Him night and day and they tire not they never weary thereof.
وَمِنْ آيَاتِهِ أَنَّكَ تَرَى ٱلأَرْضَ خَاشِعَةً فَإِذَآ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْهَا ٱلْمَآءَ ٱهْتَزَّتْ وَرَبَتْ إِنَّ ٱلَّذِيۤ أَحْيَاهَا لَمُحْىِ ٱلْمَوْتَىٰ إِنَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,And among His signs is that you see the earth desolate dried out without any vegetation but when We send down water upon it it stirs it moves and swells swells and rises. Truly He Who revives it is indeed the Reviver of the dead. Surely He has power over all things.
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يُلْحِدُونَ فِيۤ آيَاتِنَا لاَ يَخْفَوْنَ عَلَيْنَآ أَفَمَن يُلْقَىٰ فِي ٱلنَّارِ خَيْرٌ أَم مَّن يَأْتِيۤ آمِناً يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ ٱعْمَلُواْ مَا شِئْتُمْ إِنَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ,Indeed those who blaspheme yulhidūna derives from the verb alhada or lahada ‘he blasphemed’ Our signs — the Qur’ān by denying its truth — are not hidden from Us and We will requite them. Is one who is cast into the Fire better off or one who arrives secure on the Day of Resurrection? Act as you wish; indeed He is Seer of what you do — this is meant as a threat for them.
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ بِٱلذِّكْرِ لَمَّا جَآءَهُمْ وَإِنَّهُ لَكِتَابٌ عَزِيزٌ,Truly those who disbelieve in the Remembrance — the Qur’ān — when it comes to them … We will requite them — and truly it is an unassailable Book
لاَّ يَأْتِيهِ ٱلْبَاطِلُ مِن بَيْنِ يَدَيْهِ وَلاَ مِنْ خَلْفِهِ تَنزِيلٌ مِّنْ حَكِيمٍ حَمِيدٍ,falsehood cannot approach it from before it or from behind it in other words there is no scripture before it or after it that contradicts it; it is a revelation from One Wise Praised that is to say from God the One Who is praised in His affair.
مَّا يُقَالُ لَكَ إِلاَّ مَا قَدْ قِيلَ لِلرُّسُلِ مِن قَبْلِكَ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَذُو مَغْفِرَةٍ وَذُو عِقَابٍ أَلِيمٍ,Nothing is said to you in terms of denial of you except the like of what has already been said to the messengers before you. Surely your Lord is One of forgiveness to believers and also One of painful punishment for disbelievers.
وَلَوْ جَعَلْنَاهُ قُرْآناً أعْجَمِيّاً لَّقَالُواْ لَوْلاَ فُصِّلَتْ آيَاتُهُ ءَاعْجَمِيٌّ وَعَرَبِيٌّ قُلْ هُوَ لِلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ هُدًى وَشِفَآءٌ وَٱلَّذِينَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ فِيۤ آذَانِهِمْ وَقْرٌ وَهُوَ عَلَيْهِمْ عَمًى أُوْلَـٰئِكَ يُنَادَوْنَ مِن مَّكَانٍ بَعِيدٍ,And had We made it namely the Remembrance a non-Arabic Qur’ān they would have said ‘Why have its signs not been explained clearly? so that we might understand them? What! a Qur’ān that is non-Arabic and an Arab prophet?’ this is an interrogative of denial spoken by them; read a-a‘jamiyyun pronouncing both the first and the second hamza or by changing it into an alif and either writing it out in full or not. Say ‘For those who believe it is guidance from error and a healing from the disease of ignorance; but as for those who do not believe there is a deafness in their ears a heaviness and so they are unable to hear it and they are blind to it so they are unable to comprehend it. Those they are as if they were being called from a distant place’ that is to say they are like one who is called from far away unable to hear or comprehend what is being called out to him.
وَلَقَدْ آتَيْنَا مُوسَى ٱلْكِتَابَ فَٱخْتُلِفَ فِيهِ وَلَوْلاَ كَلِمَةٌ سَبَقَتْ مِن رَّبِّكَ لَقُضِيَ بَيْنَهُمْ وَإِنَّهُمْ لَفِي شَكٍّ مِّنْهُ مُرِيبٍ,And verily We gave Moses the Scripture the Torah but differences arose concerning it in terms of some affirming the truth of it and others denying it as with the Qur’ān; and were it not for a Word that had already preceded from your Lord to defer the reckoning and requital of creatures until the Day of Resurrection judgement would have been made between them in this world concerning that over which they differed; for indeed they the deniers of it are in grave doubt concerning it doubt which leads to utter uncertainty.
مَّنْ عَمِلَ صَـٰلِحاً فَلِنَفْسِهِ وَمَنْ أَسَآءَ فَعَلَيْهَا وَمَا رَبُّكَ بِظَلَّـٰمٍ لِّلْعَبِيدِ,Whoever acts righteously it is for the good of his own soul that he acts thus and whoever does evil it is to the detriment thereof in other words the harm consequent from his evildoing will only be to him. And your Lord is not at all a tyrant to His servants that is He is not One of injustice as He exalted be He says Surely God shall not wrong so much as the weight of an atom Q. 440.
إِلَيْهِ يُرَدُّ عِلْمُ ٱلسَّاعَةِ وَمَا تَخْرُجُ مِن ثَمَرَاتٍ مِّنْ أَكْمَامِهَا وَمَا تَحْمِلُ مِنْ أُنْثَىٰ وَلاَ تَضَعُ إِلاَّ بِعِلْمِهِ وَيَوْمَ يُنَادِيهِمْ أَيْنَ شُرَكَآئِي قَالُوۤاْ آذَنَّاكَ مَا مِنَّا مِن شَهِيدٍ,To Him devolves all knowledge of the Hour — when it shall come to pass none other than Him knows this. And no fruit thamaratin a variant reading has the plural thamarātin ‘fruits’ emerges from its sheath its receptacle akmām the plural of kimm except with His knowledge and no female bears child or delivers except with His knowledge. And on the day when He will call out to them ‘Where then are My associates?’ they will say ‘We proclaim to You we now apprise You that there is no witness amongst us’ that is a witness who can testify to the allegation that You have an associate.
وَضَلَّ عَنْهُم مَّا كَانُواْ يَدْعُونَ مِن قَبْلُ وَظَنُّواْ مَا لَهُمْ مِّن مَّحِيصٍ,And what they used to call on what they used to worship before in this world of idols has forsaken them and they suppose they will be certain that there is no refuge for them no escape from the chastisement the negation in both instances comments on the operation implied in the nouns of actions; also the negation stands in place of the direct objects in both instances.
لاَّ يَسْأَمُ ٱلإِنْسَانُ مِن دُعَآءِ ٱلْخَيْرِ وَإِن مَّسَّهُ ٱلشَّرُّ فَيَئُوسٌ قَنُوطٌ,Man never wearies of supplicating for good in other words he never ceases to ask his Lord for wealth and good health and other good things but should any ill befall him such as impoverishment or hardship then he becomes despondent despairing of God’s mercy — this and what follows relates to the attitude of disbelievers.
وَلَئِنْ أَذَقْنَاهُ رَحْمَةً مِّنَّا مِن بَعْدِ ضَرَّآءَ مَسَّتْهُ لَيَقُولَنَّ هَـٰذَا لِي وَمَآ أَظُنُّ ٱلسَّاعَةَ قَآئِمَةً وَلَئِن رُّجِعْتُ إِلَىٰ رَبِّيۤ إِنَّ لِي عِندَهُ لَلْحُسْنَىٰ فَلَنُنَبِّئَنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ بِمَا عَمِلُواْ وَلَنُذِيقَنَّهُمْ مِّنْ عَذَابٍ غَلِيظٍ,And if wa-la-in the lām is for oaths We let him taste if We bestow on him mercy such as riches or good health from Us after the harm the hardship or tribulation that had befallen him he will surely say ‘This is my due! in other words it is on account of what I do. I do not think that the Hour will ever set in and even if wa-la-in the lām is for oaths I am returned to my Lord I will indeed have the best reward with Him’ namely Paradise. But We will assuredly inform those who disbelieve of what they did and assuredly We will make them taste a harsh chastisement the lām prefixed in both verbs is that for oaths.
وَإِذَآ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَى ٱلإِنسَانِ أَعْرَضَ وَنَأَى بِجَانِبِهِ وَإِذَا مَسَّهُ ٱلشَّرُّ فَذُو دُعَآءٍ عَرِيضٍ,And when We bestow graces upon man insān the generic noun is meant he shows disregard of giving thanks and turns aside turns his head in arrogance a variant reading for nā’a has na’ā; but when ill befalls him he makes prolonged supplications.
قُلْ أَرَأَيْتُمْ إِن كَانَ مِنْ عِندِ ٱللَّهِ ثُمَّ كَفَرْتُمْ بِهِ مَنْ أَضَلُّ مِمَّنْ هُوَ فِي شِقَاقٍ بَعِيدٍ,Say ‘Consider this if it the Qur’ān is from God as the Prophet says and you disbelieve in it who — in other words none — will be further astray than one who is in extreme defiance?’ of the truth this third person singular address is used instead of ‘who will be further astray than you’ in order to point out their status as disbelievers.
سَنُرِيهِمْ آيَاتِنَا فِي ٱلآفَاقِ وَفِيۤ أَنفُسِهِمْ حَتَّىٰ يَتَبَيَّنَ لَهُمْ أَنَّهُ ٱلْحَقُّ أَوَلَمْ يَكْفِ بِرَبِّكَ أَنَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ شَهِيدٌ,We shall show them Our signs in the horizons in all the regions of the heavens and the earth in the way of the luminous celestial bodies the varieties of vegetation and trees and in their own souls in the way of the exquisite craftsmanship and unique wisdom inherent in their creation until it becomes clear to them that it namely the Qur’ān is the truth revealed by God informing of the Resurrection the Reckoning and the Punishment so that they realise that they will be punished for their disbelief in it and in the one who has come with it. Is it not sufficient that your Lord bi-rabbika governs the verb yakfi ‘sufficient’ is witness to all things? annahu ‘alā kulli shay’in shahīd substitutes for bi-rabbika. In other words is not sufficient proof of your truthfulness that nothing whatsoever can be hidden from God?
أَلاَ إِنَّهُمْ فِي مِرْيَةٍ مِّن لِّقَآءِ رَبِّهِمْ أَلاَ إِنَّهُ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ مُّحِيطٌ,Nay verily they are in doubt about the encounter with their Lord because they deny the Resurrection. Nay verily He exalted be He encompasses all things in knowledge and in power and so He will requite them for their disbelief.
حـمۤ,Hā mīm
عۤسۤقۤ,‘ayn sīn qāf God knows best what He means by these letters.
كَذَلِكَ يُوحِيۤ إِلَيْكَ وَإِلَى ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ,Thus — in other words in the same manner of revelation — does He reveal to you and did He reveal to those who were before you God Allāhu is the agent of the action of revelation the Mighty in His kingdom the Wise in His actions.
لَهُ مَا فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَهُوَ ٱلْعَلِيُّ ٱلعَظِيمُ,To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth as possession creation and servants and He is the Exalted above His creatures the Tremendous the Great.
تَكَادُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتُ يَتَفَطَّرْنَ مِن فَوْقِهِنَّ وَٱلْمَلاَئِكَةُ يُسَبِّحُونَ بِحَمْدِ رَبِّهِمْ وَيَسْتَغْفِرُونَ لِمَن فِي ٱلأَرْضِ أَلاَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ هُوَ ٱلْغَفُورُ ٱلرَّحِيمُ,The heavens are well-nigh read yakādu or takādu rent asunder yanfatirna a variant reading has yatafattarna from above one another in other words well-nigh is each one torn away from above the one below it because of the magnitude of God exalted be He and the angels glorify with praise of their Lord in other words they are continuously engaged in praise of Him and ask forgiveness for those believers on earth. Verily God is the Forgiving to His friends the Merciful to them.
وَٱلَّذِينَ ٱتَّخَذُواْ مِن دُونِهِ أَوْلِيَآءَ ٱللَّهُ حَفِيظٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَمَآ أَنتَ عَلَيْهِم بِوَكِيلٍ,And those who have taken besides Him namely idols as guardians God is watchful over them He keeps count of their deeds that He may requite them; and you are not a guardian over them in order to secure what is demanded of them your duty is only to deliver the Message.
وَكَذَلِكَ أَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَيْكَ قُرْآناً عَرَبِيّاً لِّتُنذِرَ أُمَّ ٱلْقُرَىٰ وَمَنْ حَوْلَهَا وَتُنذِرَ يَوْمَ ٱلْجَمْعِ لاَ رَيْبَ فِيهِ فَرِيقٌ فِي ٱلْجَنَّةِ وَفَرِيقٌ فِي ٱلسَّعِيرِ,And thus — in the same manner of revelation — have We revealed to you an Arabic Qur’ān that you may warn that you may threaten the mother-town and those around it namely the inhabitants of Mecca and all other people and that you may warn all people of the Day of Gathering the Day of Resurrection whereat all creatures will be gathered of which there is no doubt. A part of them will be in Paradise and a part will be in the Blaze the Fire.
وَلَوْ شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ لَجَعَلَهُمْ أُمَّةً وَاحِدَةً وَلَـٰكِن يُدْخِلُ مَن يَشَآءُ فِي رَحْمَتِهِ وَٱلظَّالِمُونَ مَا لَهُمْ مِّن وَلِيٍّ وَلاَ نَصِيرٍ,And had God willed He would have made them one community in other words following one religion and that is Islam; but He admits whomever He will into His mercy and the evildoers the disbelievers have neither guardian nor helper to ward off the chastisement from them.
أَمِ ٱتَّخَذُواْ مِن دُونِهِ أَوْلِيَآءَ فَٱللَّهُ هُوَ ٱلْوَلِيُّ وَهُوَ يُحْيِـي ٱلْمَوْتَىٰ وَهُوَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,Or have they taken idols as guardians besides Him? am ‘or’ is disjunctive functioning with the sense of bal ‘nay but’ the one used to denote a shift in the subject matter; the hamza is for denial in other words ‘those who are taken’ as guardians are not in fact guardians of anything. But God He alone is the Guardian in other words then One who helps believers the fā’ of fa’Llāhu is merely for coordination and He revives the dead and He has power over all things.
وَمَا ٱخْتَلَفْتُمْ فِيهِ مِن شَيْءٍ فَحُكْمُهُ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ ذَلِكُمُ ٱللَّهُ رَبِّي عَلَيْهِ تَوَكَّلْتُ وَإِلَيْهِ أُنِيبُ,And whatever you may differ with disbelievers in of religion or otherwise the verdict therein belongs it will return to God on the Day of Resurrection; He will judge between you. Say to them That then is God my Lord; in Him I have put my trust and to Him I turn penitently.
فَاطِرُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ جَعَلَ لَكُم مِّنْ أَنفُسِكُمْ أَزْوَاجاً وَمِنَ ٱلأَنْعَامِ أَزْواجاً يَذْرَؤُكُمْ فِيهِ لَيْسَ كَمِثْلِهِ شَيْءٌ وَهُوَ ٱلسَّمِيعُ ٱلْبَصِيرُ,The Originator of the heavens and the earth the One Who created them without precedent. He has made for you from your own selves pairs when He created Eve from Adam’s rib and also pairs males and females of the cattle He multiplies you read yadhra’ukum by such means by the mentioned ‘making’ that is to say He multiplies you through this means by way of propagation the suffixed pronoun -kum in yadhra’ukum ‘He multiplies you’ refers to both human beings and cattle but predominantly to humans. There is nothing like Him ka-mithlihi the kāf is extra as there is no likeness of Him exalted be He. He is the Hearer of what is said the Seer of what is done.
لَهُ مَقَالِيدُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ يَبْسُطُ ٱلرِّزْقَ لِمَن يَشَآءُ وَيَقْدِرُ إِنَّهُ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عَلِيمٌ,To Him belong the keys of the heavens and the earth the keys to their storehouses of rain and vegetation and other things. He extends provision He makes it abundant for whomever He will as a test of their gratitude and He restricts it He straitens it for whomever He will as a trial. Truly He has knowledge of all things.
شَرَعَ لَكُم مِّنَ ٱلدِّينِ مَا وَصَّىٰ بِهِ نُوحاً وَٱلَّذِيۤ أَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَيْكَ وَمَا وَصَّيْنَا بِهِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَمُوسَىٰ وَعِيسَىٰ أَنْ أَقِيمُواْ ٱلدِّينَ وَلاَ تَتَفَرَّقُواْ فِيهِ كَبُرَ عَلَى ٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ مَا تَدْعُوهُمْ إِلَيْهِ ٱللَّهُ يَجْتَبِيۤ إِلَيْهِ مَن يَشَآءُ وَيَهْدِيۤ إِلَيْهِ مَن يُنِيبُ,He has prescribed for you as a religion that which He enjoined upon Noah — for he was the first of the prophets sent with a Divine Law — and that which We have revealed to you and that which We enjoined upon Abraham and Moses and Jesus declaring ‘Establish religion and do not be divided in it’ this is what has been prescribed and enjoined upon those mentioned above and what has been revealed to Muhammad (s) and it is the affirmation of God’s Oneness. Dreadful is for the idolaters that to which you summon them in the way of affirming the Oneness of God. God chooses for it for the task of affirming His Oneness whomever He will and He guides to it whomever turns penitently whomever applies himself to obedience of Him.
وَمَا تَفَرَّقُوۤاْ إِلاَّ مِن بَعْدِ مَا جَآءَهُمُ ٱلْعِلْمُ بَغْياً بَيْنَهُمْ وَلَوْلاَ كَلِمَةٌ سَبَقَتْ مِن رَّبِّكَ إِلَىٰ أَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّى لَّقُضِيَ بِيْنَهُمْ وَإِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ أُورِثُواْ ٱلْكِتَابَ مِن بَعْدِهِمْ لَفِي شَكٍّ مِّنْهُ مُرِيبٍ,And they did not become divided that is the adherents of the monotheistic religions did not become divided in religion — so that some affirmed the Oneness of God while others rejected it — except after the knowledge of His Oneness had come to them out of jealous rivalry on the part of the disbelievers among themselves. And were it not for a Word that preceded from your Lord to defer requital of them until an appointed term until the Day of Resurrection it would have already been judged between them to chastise the disbelievers in this world. And indeed those who were made heirs to the Scripture after them namely the Jews and the Christians are truly in grave doubt concerning him Muhammad (s).
فَلِذَلِكَ فَٱدْعُ وَٱسْتَقِمْ كَمَآ أُمِرْتَ وَلاَ تَتَّبِعْ أَهْوَآءَهُمْ وَقُلْ آمَنتُ بِمَآ أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ مِن كِتَابٍ وَأُمِرْتُ لأَعْدِلَ بَيْنَكُمُ ٱللَّهُ رَبُّنَا وَرَبُّكُمْ لَنَآ أَعْمَالُنَا وَلَكُمْ أَعْمَالُكُمْ لاَ حُجَّةَ بَيْنَنَا وَبَيْنَكُمُ ٱللَّهُ يَجْمَعُ بَيْنَنَا وَإِلَيْهِ ٱلْمَصِيرُ,So to that then to that affirmation of God’s Oneness summon O Muhammad (s) people and be upright in summoning them to this just as you have been commanded and do not follow them in their desires to abandon it. And say ‘I believe in whatever Book God has revealed. And I have been commanded to be just between you in passing judgement. God is our Lord and your Lord. Our deeds concern us and your deeds concern you and so each one of us will be requited according to his own deeds. There is no argument no dispute between us and you — this was revealed before the command to struggle against them. God will bring us together at the time of the Return to decide definitively between us and to Him is the final destination’ the ultimate return.
وَٱلَّذِينَ يُحَآجُّونَ فِي ٱللَّهِ مِن بَعْدِ مَا ٱسَتُجِيبَ لَهُ حُجَّتُهُمْ دَاحِضَةٌ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ وَعَلَيْهِمْ غَضَبٌ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ شَدِيدٌ,And those who argue with the Prophet concerning the religion of God after His call has been answered through faith on account of His miracle having been manifested — and they are the Jews — their argument stands refuted is invalid with their Lord and His wrath shall be upon them and there will be a severe chastisement for them.
ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِيۤ أَنزَلَ ٱلْكِتَابَ بِٱلْحَقِّ وَٱلْمِيزَانَ وَمَا يُدْرِيكَ لَعَلَّ ٱلسَّاعَةَ قَرِيبٌ,God it is Who has revealed the Book the Qur’ān with the truth bi’l-haqqi is semantically connected to anzala ‘revealed’ as well as the Balance Justice. And what do you know — perhaps the Hour that is its arrival is near! la‘alla ‘perhaps’ comments on the verb describing the action with what follows it functioning as two direct objects.
يَسْتَعْجِلُ بِهَا ٱلَّذِينَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِهَا وَٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ مُشْفِقُونَ مِنْهَا وَيَعْلَمُونَ أَنَّهَا ٱلْحَقُّ أَلاَ إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يُمَارُونَ فَي ٱلسَّاعَةِ لَفِي ضَلاَلٍ بَعِيدٍ,Those who do not believe in it seek to hasten it they say ‘When will it come?’ as a presumption on their part that it will never come; but those who believe are apprehensive of it and know that it is the truth. Nay but verily those who are in doubt those who argue concerning the Hour are indeed in extreme error!
ٱللَّهُ لَطِيفٌ بِعِبَادِهِ يَرْزُقُ مَن يَشَآءُ وَهُوَ ٱلْقَوِيُّ ٱلْعَزِيزُ,God is Gracious to His servants both the pious and the profligate for He does not destroy them through hunger despite their acts of disobedience. He provides for whomever He will from among each of the two classes of individuals whatever He will. And He is the Strong in effecting what He wants the Mighty Whose way always prevails.
مَن كَانَ يُرِيدُ حَرْثَ ٱلآخِرَةِ نَزِدْ لَهُ فِي حَرْثِهِ وَمَن كَانَ يُرِيدُ حَرْثَ ٱلدُّنْيَا نُؤْتِهِ مِنْهَا وَمَا لَهُ فِي ٱلآخِرَةِ مِن نَّصِيبٍ,And whoever desires in return for his actions the harvest of the Hereafter in other words its gains and that is reward We will enhance for him his harvest by multiplying in it the good deed up tenfold or more; and whoever desires the harvest of this world We will give him of it without multiplying any of it giving him only what is his preordained share; but in the Hereafter he will have no share.
أَمْ لَهُمْ شُرَكَاءُ شَرَعُواْ لَهُمْ مِّنَ ٱلدِّينِ مَا لَمْ يَأْذَن بِهِ ٱللَّهُ وَلَوْلاَ كَلِمَةُ ٱلْفَصْلِ لَقُضِيَ بَيْنَهُمْ وَإِنَّ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,Or have they the Meccan disbelievers associates — these being their devils — who have prescribed for them for the disbelievers a religion a corrupt religion which God has not given permission for? such as idolatry and denial of resurrection? And were it not for a prior decisive word in other words a prior decree to the effect that requital will take place on the Day of Resurrection it would have been judged between them and the believers by chastising the former in this world. Truly the wrongdoers the disbelievers will have a painful chastisement.
تَرَى ٱلظَّالِمِينَ مُشْفِقِينَ مِمَّا كَسَبُواْ وَهُوَ وَاقِعٌ بِهِمْ وَٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ فِي رَوْضَاتِ ٱلْجَنَّاتِ لَهُمْ مَّا يَشَآءُونَ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ ذَلِكَ هُوَ ٱلْفَضْلُ ٱلْكَبِيرُ,You will see the wrongdoers on the Day of Resurrection apprehensive because of what they had earned in this world in the way of evil deeds lest they be requited for these; and it that is the requital for these deeds will surely befall them on the Day of Resurrection inevitably; but those who believe and perform righteous deeds will be in the lushest Gardens in other words in the best of these Gardens in comparison with the other ones. They will have whatever they wish near their Lord; that is the great favour.
ذَلِكَ ٱلَّذِي يُبَشِّرُ ٱللَّهُ عِبَادَهُ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ قُل لاَّ أَسْأَلُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ أَجْراً إِلاَّ ٱلْمَوَدَّةَ فِي ٱلْقُرْبَىٰ وَمَن يَقْتَرِفْ حَسَنَةً نَّزِدْ لَهُ فِيهَا حُسْناً إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ شَكُورٌ,That is the good tidings read yubshiru or yubashshiru from bishāra ‘good news’ which God gives to His servants who believe and perform righteous deeds. Say ‘I do not ask of you any reward for it for delivering the Message except the affection for my kinsfolk illā ‘except’ this represents a discontinuous exception in other words ‘but I do ask of you that you show affection for my kinship with you which at the same time is your kinship’; for he the Prophet had kinship ties with all the subdivisions of the tribe of Quraysh. And whoever acquires a good deed an act of obedience We shall enhance for him its goodness by multiplying the reward for it. Surely God is Forgiving of sins Appreciative even of little good and so He multiplies it manifold.
أَمْ يَقُولُونَ ٱفْتَرَىٰ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ كَذِباً فَإِن يَشَإِ ٱللَّهُ يَخْتِمْ عَلَىٰ قَلْبِكَ وَيَمْحُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْبَاطِلَ وَيُحِقُّ ٱلْحَقَّ بِكَلِمَاتِهِ إِنَّهُ عَلِيمٌ بِذَاتِ ٱلصُّدُورِ,Or am here is like bal do they say ‘He has invented a lie against God?’ in ascribing the Qur’ān to God exalted be He. For if God will He can seal He can fortify your heart with patience to endure the hurt they cause you by such sayings and otherwise — and God did this. And God will efface the falsehood which they speak and vindicate confirm the truth with His words the ones revealed to His Prophet. Truly He is Knower of what is in the breasts of what is in the hearts of people.
وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِي يَقْبَلُ ٱلتَّوْبَةَ عَنْ عِبَادِهِ وَيَعْفُواْ عَنِ ٱلسَّيِّئَاتِ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا تَفْعَلُونَ,And He it is Who accepts repentance from His servants and pardons evil deeds those from which repentance has been made and knows what they do yaf‘alūna may also be read taf‘alūna ‘you do’.
وَيَسْتَجِيبُ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ وَيَزِيدُهُم مِّن فَضْلِهِ وَٱلْكَافِرُونَ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ شَدِيدٌ,And He answers those who believe and perform righteous deeds He grants them what they ask for and He enhances them of His bounty. And as for the disbelievers for them there will be a severe chastisement.
وَلَوْ بَسَطَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلرِّزْقَ لِعِبَادِهِ لَبَغَوْاْ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَلَـٰكِن يُنَزِّلُ بِقَدَرٍ مَّا يَشَآءُ إِنَّهُ بِعِبَادِهِ خَبِيرٌ بَصِيرٌ,For were God to extend His provision to His servants to all of them they would all of them surely become covetous in other words they would become tyrants in the earth; but He sends down read yunzilu or yunazzilu of provisions in the measure that He will thus extending it for some of His servants to the exclusion of others — and from such extending of provision to some emerges tyranny. Surely He is Aware Seer of His servants.
وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِي يُنَزِّلُ ٱلْغَيْثَ مِن بَعْدِ مَا قَنَطُواْ وَيَنشُرُ رَحْمَتَهُ وَهُوَ ٱلْوَلِيُّ ٱلْحَمِيدُ,And He it is Who sends down the saving rain after they have despaired after they have given up hope of its being sent down and unfolds His mercy He extends His rain and He is the true Patron the Benevolent towards believers the Praised by them.
وَمِنْ آيَاتِهِ خَلْقُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَمَا بَثَّ فِيهِمَا مِن دَآبَّةٍ وَهُوَ عَلَىٰ جَمْعِهِمْ إِذَا يَشَآءُ قَدِيرٌ,And of His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and the creation of whatever He has scattered whatever He has divided and spread in them in the way of creatures dābba this denotes all those creatures which tread yadubbu upon the earth whether human beings or otherwise. And He is able to bring them together for the Gathering whenever He will rational beings as opposed to others predominate in the suffixed pronoun -him of jam‘ihim ‘to bring them together’.
وَمَآ أَصَـٰبَكُمْ مِّن مُّصِيبَةٍ فَبِمَا كَسَبَتْ أَيْدِيكُمْ وَيَعْفُواْ عَن كَثِيرٍ,And whatever affliction whatever misfortune or hardship may befall you — this is an address to the believers — is on account of what your own hands have earned that is to say for the sins that you have committed — the use of ‘hands’ to express this is because most actions are effected by them. And He pardons much of these sins and does not requite them for God’s kindness is greater than that He should for example double the requital in the Hereafter; as for those who do not commit grave sins then what befalls them in this world of hardship raises their degree in the reward of the Hereafter.
وَمَآ أَنتُمْ بِمُعْجِزِينَ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَمَا لَكُمْ مِّن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ مِن وَلِيٍّ وَلاَ نَصِيرٍ,And you O idolaters cannot escape from God by fleeing on earth and thus elude Him and besides God that is to say other than Him you have neither protector nor helper to ward off His chastisement from you.
وَمِنْ آيَاتِهِ ٱلْجَوَارِ فِي ٱلْبَحْرِ كَٱلأَعْلاَمِ,And of His signs are the ships that run on the sea appearing like landmarks like mountains in terms of their magnitude.
إِن يَشَأْ يُسْكِنِ ٱلرِّيحَ فَيَظْلَلْنَ رَوَاكِدَ عَلَىٰ ظَهْرِهِ إِنَّ فِي ذَلِكَ لآيَاتٍ لِّكُلِّ صَبَّارٍ شَكُورٍ,If He will He stills the wind whereat they remain they become motionless fixed not moving on its surface. Surely in that there are signs for every steadfast grateful servant — this is the believer who is steadfast during hardship and grateful in times of comfort.
أَوْ يُوبِقْهُنَّ بِمَا كَسَبُوا وَيَعْفُ عَن كَثِيرٍ,Or He wrecks them yūbiqhunna a supplement to yuskin ‘He stills’ that is to say or He sinks them including their passengers by sending violent winds upon them because of what they that is the passengers of these ships have earned of sins. And He pardons much of such sin and does not cause those who have sinned to drown.
وَيَعْلَمَ ٱلَّذِينَ يُجَادِلُونَ فِيۤ آيَاتِنَا مَا لَهُمْ مِّن مَّحِيصٍ,And that those who dispute concerning Our signs may know read indicative wa-ya‘lamu ‘and they know’ beginning a new sentence; or subjunctive wa-ya‘lama ‘and that they may know’ as a supplement to an implicit reason in other words ‘He drowns them in order to exact vengeance against them and so that they may know that …’ they have no refuge no escape from the chastisement the negation represents two direct objects of the verb ya‘lamu or ya‘lama ‘they know’; the negation is also a comment on the implied action of ‘escaping’.
فَمَآ أُوتِيتُمْ مِّن شَيْءٍ فَمَتَاعُ ٱلْحَيَاةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَمَا عِندَ ٱللَّهِ خَيْرٌ وَأَبْقَىٰ لِلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَعَلَىٰ رَبِّهِمْ يَتَوَكَّلُونَ,So whatever you — this is an address is to believers and others — have been given of the luxuries of this world is but the enjoyment of the life of this world enjoyed for the duration of it but then perishes. But what is with God of reward is better and more lasting for those who believe and put their trust in their Lord li’lladhīna āmanū wa-‘alā rabbihim yatawakkalūna is supplemented by the following clause
وَٱلَّذِينَ يَجْتَنِبُونَ كَبَائِرَ ٱلإِثْمِ وَٱلْفَوَاحِشَ وَإِذَا مَا غَضِبُواْ هُمْ يَغْفِرُونَ,and those who avoid grave sins and indecencies those acts that require the implementing of the prescribed legal punishments hudūd the supplement above is an example of supplementing the part to the whole and who when they are angry forgive they let it pass;
وَٱلَّذِينَ ٱسْتَجَابُواْ لِرَبِّهِمْ وَأَقَامُواْ ٱلصَّلاَةَ وَأَمْرُهُمْ شُورَىٰ بَيْنَهُمْ وَمِمَّا رَزَقْنَاهُمْ يُنفِقُونَ,and those who answer their Lord those who respond to what He has summoned them in the way of affirming His Oneness and worship of Him and observe prayer maintaining it regularly and whose courses of action those courses of action that seem good to them are a matter of counsel between them in which they consult one another and do not act hastily and who of what We have bestowed on them expend in obedience to God — such mentioned individuals constitute one category;
وَٱلَّذِينَ إِذَآ أَصَابَهُمُ ٱلْبَغْيُ هُمْ يَنتَصِرُونَ,and those who when they suffer aggression injustice defend themselves — these are another category — that is to say they retaliate against those who wrong them in the same manner in which the latter wronged them as God exalted be He says
وَجَزَآءُ سَيِّئَةٍ سَيِّئَةٌ مِّثْلُهَا فَمَنْ عَفَا وَأَصْلَحَ فَأَجْرُهُ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ إِنَّهُ لاَ يُحِبُّ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ,For the requital of an evil deed is an evil deed like it the latter is also referred to as ‘an evil deed’ because in outward form it resembles the former; this is evident in what concerns retaliation for wounds. Some scholars say that even if another were to say ‘May God disgrace you!’ then one should respond equally with ‘May God disgrace you!’. But whoever pardons his wrongdoer and reconciles the amity between himself and the one pardoned his reward will be with God that is to say God will give him his reward without doubt. Truly He does not like wrongdoers that is those who initiate acts of wrongdoing and so merit His punishment.
وَلَمَنِ ٱنتَصَرَ بَعْدَ ظُلْمِهِ فَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ مَا عَلَيْهِمْ مِّن سَبِيلٍ,And whoever defends himself after he has been wronged that is to say after the wrongdoer has wronged him — for such there will be no course of action against them no blame on them.
إِنَّمَا ٱلسَّبِيلُ عَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ يَظْلِمُونَ ٱلنَّاسَ وَيَبْغُونَ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ بِغَيْرِ ٱلْحَقِّ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,A course of action is only open against those who wrong people and seek to commit who commit in the earth what is not right what are acts of disobedience. For such there will be a painful chastisement.
وَلَمَن صَبَرَ وَغَفَرَ إِنَّ ذَلِكَ لَمِنْ عَزْمِ ٱلأُمُورِ,But verily he who is patient and defend himself by retaliating and forgives excuses the wrong done to him — surely that patience and excusing is true constancy in such affairs that is to say it is one of those courses of action for which one must have firm resolve meaning those which are required of the believer by God’s Law.
وَمَن يُضْلِلِ ٱللَّهُ فَمَا لَهُ مِن وَلِيٍّ مِّن بَعْدِهِ وَتَرَى ٱلظَّالِمِينَ لَمَّا رَأَوُاْ ٱلْعَذَابَ يَقُولُونَ هَلْ إِلَىٰ مَرَدٍّ مِّن سَبِيلٍ,And whomever God leads astray has no protector after Him that is to say none to take charge of guiding him after God has led him astray. And you will see the wrongdoers when they sight the chastisement saying ‘Is there any way any route by which to return?’ to this world.
وَتَرَاهُمْ يُعْرَضُونَ عَلَيْهَا خَاشِعِينَ مِنَ ٱلذُّلِّ يَنظُرُونَ مِن طَرْفٍ خَفِيٍّ وَقَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُوۤاْ إِنَّ ٱلْخَاسِرِينَ ٱلَّذِينَ خَسِرُوۤاْ أَنفُسَهُمْ وَأَهْلِيهِمْ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ أَلاَ إِنَّ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ فِي عَذَابٍ مُّقِيمٍ,And you will see them being exposed to it namely the Fire submissive fearful and humbled by abasement looking at it with a furtive glance a slight look stealthily min of min tarfin khafiyyin ‘with a furtive glance’ is to indicate inceptiveness or it functions with the sense of a bā’ ‘with’ sc. bi-tarfin khafiyyin. And those who believe will say ‘Verily the true losers are those who have lost themselves and their families on the Day of Resurrection for being condemned to abide forever in the Fire and for not being able to attain the blissful company of the houris prepared for them in Paradise had they been believers the relative clause alladhīna khasirū... ‘those who have lost …’ constitutes the predicate of the particle inna ‘verily’. Truly the wrongdoers the disbelievers will be in lasting everlasting chastisement — these words constitute God’s speech exalted be He.
وَمَا كَانَ لَهُم مِّنْ أَوْلِيَآءَ يَنصُرُونَهُم مِّن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ وَمَن يُضْلِلِ ٱللَّهُ فَمَا لَهُ مِن سَبِيلٍ,And they have no guardians to help them besides God that is to say other than Him to ward off His chastisement from them and whomever God leads astray has no course of action’ no route to the truth in this world or to Paradise in the Hereafter.
ٱسْتَجِيبُواْ لِرَبِّكُمْ مِّن قَبْلِ أَن يَأْتِيَ يَوْمٌ لاَّ مَرَدَّ لَهُ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ مَا لَكُمْ مِّن مَّلْجَأٍ يَوْمَئِذٍ وَمَا لَكُمْ مِّن نَّكِيرٍ,Answer your Lord respond to Him by affirming His Oneness and worshipping Him before there comes a day namely the Day of Resurrection for which there is no revoking from God in other words one which when He brings about He will not revoke. On that day you will have no refuge in which to seek refuge in and for you there will be no way of denying your sins.
فَإِنْ أَعْرَضُواْ فَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَاكَ عَلَيْهِمْ حَفِيظاً إِنْ عَلَيْكَ إِلاَّ ٱلْبَلاَغُ وَإِنَّآ إِذَآ أَذَقْنَا ٱلإِنسَانَ مِنَّا رَحْمَةً فَرِحَ بِهَا وَإِن تُصِبْهُمْ سَيِّئَةٌ بِمَا قَدَّمَتْ أَيْدِيهِمْ فَإِنَّ ٱلإِنسَانَ كَفُورٌ,But if they are disregardful of answering God We have not sent you as a keeper over them to keep track of their deeds by securing what is demanded of them. Your duty is only to deliver the Message — this was revealed before the command to struggle against them. And indeed when We let man taste from Us some mercy some grace such as wealth and good health he exults in it; but if some ill some calamity befalls them the pronoun here refers to ‘man’ on the basis of the plural import of the generic noun because of what their own hands have sent ahead because of what they have offered of deeds — the expression refers to ‘the hands’ because most actions are effected by them then lo! man is ungrateful for the grace.
لِلَّهِ مُلْكُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ يَخْلُقُ مَا يَشَآءُ يَهَبُ لِمَن يَشَآءُ إِنَاثاً وَيَهَبُ لِمَن يَشَآءُ ٱلذُّكُورَ,To God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. He creates whatever He will; He gives to whomever He will in the way of children females and He gives to whomever He will males.
أَوْ يُزَوِّجُهُمْ ذُكْرَاناً وَإِنَاثاً وَيَجْعَلُ مَن يَشَآءُ عَقِيماً إِنَّهُ عَلِيمٌ قَدِيرٌ,Or He combines them that is to say or He makes them males and females; and He makes whomever He will infertile such that she is unable to conceive or he cannot have a child. Surely He is Knower of what He creates Powerful in bringing about whatever He will.
وَمَا كَانَ لِبَشَرٍ أَن يُكَلِّمَهُ ٱللَّهُ إِلاَّ وَحْياً أَوْ مِن وَرَآءِ حِجَابٍ أَوْ يُرْسِلَ رَسُولاً فَيُوحِيَ بِإِذْنِهِ مَا يَشَآءُ إِنَّهُ عَلِيٌّ حَكِيمٌ,And it is not possible for any human that God should speak to him except that He should reveal to him by revelation in sleep or by inspiration or except from behind a veil where He makes the person able to hear His speech but without seeing Him — as was the case with Moses peace be upon him; or except that He should send a messenger an angel such as Gabriel and he the messenger then reveals to the person to whom he has been sent that is to say and then he speaks to him with His permission that is God’s whatever He God will. Truly He is Exalted above the attributes of created beings Wise in His actions.
وَكَذَلِكَ أَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَيْكَ رُوحاً مِّنْ أَمْرِنَا مَا كُنتَ تَدْرِي مَا ٱلْكِتَابُ وَلاَ ٱلإِيمَانُ وَلَـٰكِن جَعَلْنَاهُ نُوراً نَّهْدِي بِهِ مَن نَّشَآءُ مِنْ عِبَادِنَا وَإِنَّكَ لَتَهْدِيۤ إِلَىٰ صِرَاطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ,And thus in the same way that We have revealed to messengers other than you have We revealed to you O Muhammad (s) a Spirit namely the Qur’ān by which hearts are revived from Our command that command which We reveal to you. You did not know before revelation came to you what the Book was what the Qur’ān was nor faith that is its ordinances and ritual ceremonies the negation comments in place of the verb on the action and what has come after it constitutes two direct objects; but We have made it namely the Spirit — or the Qur’ān — a light by which We guide whomever We will of Our servants. And verily you guide you are summoning people by means of what is revealed to you to a straight path a straight way the religion of Islam
صِرَاطِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلَّذِي لَهُ مَا فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِي ٱلأَرْضِ أَلاَ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ تَصِيرُ ٱلأُمُورُ,the path of God to Whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth as possessions creatures and servants. Surely with God all matters end their journey all matters return.
حـمۤ,Hā mīm God knows best what He means by these letters.
وَٱلْكِتَابِ ٱلْمُبِينِ,By the Book the Qur’ān that clarifies the one that manifests the path of guidance and what one needs of the prescriptions of the Law.
إِنَّا جَعَلْنَاهُ قُرْآناً عَرَبِيّاً لَّعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ,Lo! We have made it We have brought the Book into existence as an Arabic Qur’ān in the language of the Arabs that perhaps you O people of Mecca may understand that you may comprehend its meanings.
وَإِنَّهُ فِيۤ أُمِّ ٱلْكِتَابِ لَدَيْنَا لَعَلِيٌّ حَكِيمٌ,And it is indeed fixed in the Mother Book the source of all the scriptures namely the Preserved Tablet which is with Us ladaynā substitutes for fī ummi’l-kitābi ‘in the Mother Book’ and it is indeed exalted above all the scriptures that came before it wise containing excellent wisdoms.
أَفَنَضْرِبُ عَنكُمُ ٱلذِّكْرَ صَفْحاً أَن كُنتُمْ قَوْماً مُّسْرِفِينَ,Shall We turn away shall We withhold from you the Remembrance the Qur’ān utterly an utter withholding so that you are then neither commanded nor forbidden because you are a profligate an idolatrous folk? No!
وَكَمْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن نَّبِيٍّ فِي ٱلأَوَّلِينَ,And how many a prophet did We send among the ancients!
وَمَا يَأْتِيهِم مِّنْ نَّبِيٍّ إِلاَّ كَانُواْ بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِئُونَ,And never did a prophet come to them but that they used to deride him in the same way that your people deride you — this statement is intended to comfort the Prophet s.
فَأَهْلَكْنَآ أَشَدَّ مِنْهُم بَطْشاً وَمَضَىٰ مَثَلُ ٱلأَوَّلِينَ,So We destroyed those who were mightier than them — than your people — in prowess strength and already there passed there has been mentioned in previous verses the example of the ancients the description of how they were destroyed and thus the sequel for your people will be the same.
وَلَئِن سَأَلْتَهُمْ مَّنْ خَلَقَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضَ لَيَقُولُنَّ خَلَقَهُنَّ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْعَلِيمُ,And if wa-la-in the lām is for oaths you ask them ‘Who created the heavens and the earth?’ they will surely say the indicative nūn has been omitted because of the other nūn coming after it and likewise the wāw replaced by the damma in -lunna because of two unvowelled consonants coming together ‘The Mighty the Knower created them’ — this would have to be their eventual response that is to say God created them Lord of Might and Knowledge. God exalted be He adds
ٱلَّذِي جَعَلَ لَكُمُ ٱلأَرْضَ مَهْداً وَجَعَلَ لَكُمْ فِيهَا سُبُلاً لَّعَلَّكُمْ تَهْتَدُونَ,He Who made the earth a cradle for you a flat resting-place like a child’s cradle and placed for you therein ways routes that perhaps you may be guided to your destinations during your travels;
وَٱلَّذِي نَزَّلَ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مَآءً بِقَدَرٍ فَأَنشَرْنَا بِهِ بَلْدَةً مَّيْتاً كَذَلِكَ تُخْرَجُونَ,and Who sent down water from the heaven in measure that is to say in the measure that you require thereof and did not send it down in a deluge and We revived with it a dead land. Thus — like this revivification — will you be brought forth from your graves alive;
وَٱلَّذِي خَلَقَ ٱلأَزْوَاجَ كُلَّهَا وَجَعَلَ لَكُمْ مِّنَ ٱلْفُلْكِ وَٱلأَنْعَامِ مَا تَرْكَبُونَ,and Who created the pairs the species all of them and made for you ships and cattle such as camels on which you ride the referential pronoun has been omitted here for brevity; it is genitive in the case of the first that is fīhi sc. tarkabūna fīhi ‘you ride in them’ and accusative in the case of the second sc. tarkabūnahā ‘you ride them’
لِتَسْتَوُواْ عَلَىٰ ظُهُورِهِ ثُمَّ تَذْكُرُواْ نِعْمَةَ رَبِّكُمْ إِذَا ٱسْتَوَيْتُمْ عَلَيْهِ وَتَقُولُواْ سُبْحَانَ ٱلَّذِي سَخَّرَ لَنَا هَـٰذَا وَمَا كُنَّا لَهُ مُقْرِنِينَ,that you may sit that you may find a firm position upon their backs He has made the suffixed pronoun a masculine plural and rendered zahr ‘back’ plural because of the particle mā and its plural import; and then remember your Lord’s grace when you are settled on them and say ‘Glory be to Him Who has disposed this for us and we by ourselves were no match for it not capable of it.
وَإِنَّآ إِلَىٰ رَبِّنَا لَمُنقَلِبُونَ,And indeed it is to our Lord that we shall return’ to Him that we shall depart.
وَجَعَلُواْ لَهُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ جُزْءًا إِنَّ ٱلإنسَانَ لَكَفُورٌ مُّبِينٌ,And they assign to Him from among His own servants a part when they say that the angels are God’s daughters — for a child is a part of its parent — even though the angels are like them servants of His exalted be He. Man such as the one who says the above-mentioned words is verily a manifest ingrate one whose ungratefulness is manifest and clear.
أَمِ ٱتَّخَذَ مِمَّا يَخْلُقُ بَنَاتٍ وَأَصْفَاكُم بِٱلْبَنِينَ,Or am has the significance of the hamza of denial; the ‘saying’ is implied in other words a-taqūlūna ‘or do you say that …’ He has adopted from all that He has created daughters for Himself and preferred you privileged you with sons? — that which is the necessary inference from what you claim and which by itself is an abomination.
وَإِذَا بُشِّرَ أَحَدُهُم بِمَا ضَرَبَ لِلرَّحْمَـٰنِ مَثَلاً ظَلَّ وَجْهُهُ مُسْوَدّاً وَهُوَ كَظِيمٌ,And when one of them is given the good tidings of that which he has attributed to the Compassionate One of that which he has likened to Him by the ascription to Him of daughters — for a child is likened to its parent; in other words when one of them is informed that a daughter has been born to him his face becomes darkened transformed into one laden with anguish and he chokes inwardly filled with anguish so how can such a person then attribute daughters to Him? Exalted be He high above such claims.
أَوَمَن يُنَشَّأُ فِي ٱلْحِلْيَةِ وَهُوَ فِي ٱلْخِصَامِ غَيْرُ مُبِينٍ,What! a-wa contains both the hamza of denial and the conjunctive waw ‘and’ in other words ‘do they ascribe to God …’ one that is brought up amid trinkets ornaments and is incoherent in a dispute? unable to argue clearly because of an inherent inability in this respect as a result of that person belonging to the female sex.
وَجَعَلُواْ ٱلْمَلاَئِكَةَ ٱلَّذِينَ هُمْ عِبَادُ ٱلرَّحْمَـٰنِ إِنَاثاً أَشَهِدُواْ خَلْقَهُمْ سَتُكْتَبُ شَهَادَتُهُمْ وَيُسْأَلُونَ,And they have made the angels who are themselves servants of the Compassionate One females. Did they witness were they present at their creation? Their testimony to the effect that they are females will be written down and they will be questioned about it in the Hereafter wherefore punishment will ensue for them.
وَقَالُواْ لَوْ شَآءَ ٱلرَّحْمَـٰنُ مَا عَبَدْنَاهُمْ مَّا لَهُم بِذَلِكَ مِنْ عِلْمٍ إِنْ هُمْ إِلاَّ يَخْرُصُونَ,And they say ‘Had the Compassionate One so willed we would not have worshipped them’ the angels therefore our worship of them happens by His will and so He must be satisfied with it. God exalted be He says They do not have any knowledge of that which is said of His being satisfied with the worship of these angels; and they are only surmising inventing lies in this respect and so punishment will befall them as a result thereof.
أَمْ آتَيْنَاهُمْ كِتَاباً مِّن قَبْلِهِ فَهُم بِهِ مُسْتَمْسِكُونَ,Or have We brought them a scripture before that is before the Qur’ān that they should worship other than God so that they are holding fast to it? In other words this never happened.
بَلْ قَالُوۤاْ إِنَّا وَجَدْنَآ ءَابَآءَنَا عَلَىٰ أُمَّةٍ وَإِنَّا عَلَىٰ ءَاثَارِهِم مُّهْتَدُونَ,Nay but they say ‘Lo! we found our fathers following a certain creed and we are indeed proceeding in their footsteps to be guided’ by them for they used to worship other than God.
وَكَذَلِكَ مَآ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ فِي قَرْيَةٍ مِّن نَّذِيرٍ إِلاَّ قَالَ مُتْرَفُوهَآ إِنَّا وَجَدْنَآ ءَابَآءَنَا عَلَىٰ أُمَّةٍ وَإِنَّا عَلَىٰ ءَاثَارِهِم مُّقْتَدُونَ,And thus We never sent a warner before you into any city without that its affluent folk those of comfortable means said the like of what your people say ‘Lo! we found our fathers following a certain creed and so we are indeed following in their footsteps’.
قَٰلَ أَوَلَوْ جِئْتُكُمْ بِأَهْدَىٰ مِمَّا وَجَدتُّمْ عَلَيْهِ آبَآءَكُمْ قَالُوۤاْ إِنَّا بِمَآ أُرْسِلْتُمْ بِهِ كَافِرُونَ,Say to them ‘What! Will you follow them even if I bring you a better means to guidance than what you found your fathers following?’ They say ‘Lo! we disbelieve in what you and those before you are sent with’. God exalted be He says to them as a threat to them
فَٱنتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَٱنظُرْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَاقِبَةُ ٱلْمُكَذِّبِينَ,So We took vengeance on them that is to say on those who denied the messengers before you; behold then how was the sequel for the deniers.
وَإِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ لأَبِيهِ وَقَوْمِهِ إِنَّنِي بَرَآءٌ مِّمَّا تَعْبُدُونَ,And mention when Abraham said to his father and his people ‘Surely I am innocent of that which you worship
إِلاَّ ٱلَّذِي فَطَرَنِي فَإِنَّهُ سَيَهْدِينِ,except Him Who originated created me; for He will indeed guide me’ He will show me the way to His religion.
وَجَعَلَهَا كَلِمَةً بَاقِيَةً فِي عَقِبِهِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ,And he made it namely the statement of the affirmation of God’s Oneness understood from his words I shall indeed depart to my Lord; He will guide me Q. 3799 a word enduring among his posterity his descendants and thus there still remains among them those who affirm the Oneness of God; that perhaps they that is the people of Mecca might recant what they follow and return to the religion of their forefather Abraham.
بَلْ مَتَّعْتُ هَـٰؤُلاَءِ وَآبَآءَهُمْ حَتَّىٰ جَآءَهُمُ ٱلْحَقُّ وَرَسُولٌ مُّبِينٌ,Nay but I have let these idolaters and their fathers enjoy life without hastening to punish them until there came to them the truth the Qur’ān and a messenger who makes things clear one who manifests to them the stipulations of the Law — and this messenger is Muhammad (s).
وَلَمَّا جَآءَهُمُ ٱلْحَقُّ قَالُواْ هَـٰذَا سِحْرٌ وَإِنَّا بِهِ كَافِرُونَ,But when the truth the Qur’ān came to them they said ‘This is sorcery and we are indeed disbelievers in it’.
وَقَالُواْ لَوْلاَ نُزِّلَ هَـٰذَا ٱلْقُرْآنُ عَلَىٰ رَجُلٍ مِّنَ ٱلْقَرْيَتَيْنِ عَظِيمٍ,And they said ‘If only this Qur’ān had been revealed to some great man from the inhabitants of the two towns!’ in other words from either of the two; such as al-Walīd b. al-Mughīra at Mecca or ‘Urwa b. Mas‘ūd al-Thaqafī at Tā’if.
أَهُمْ يَقْسِمُونَ رَحْمَتَ رَبِّكَ نَحْنُ قَسَمْنَا بَيْنَهُمْ مَّعِيشَتَهُمْ فِي ٱلْحَيَاةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَرَفَعْنَا بَعْضَهُمْ فَوْقَ بَعْضٍ دَرَجَاتٍ لِّيَتَّخِذَ بَعْضُهُم بَعْضاً سُخْرِيّاً وَرَحْمَتُ رَبِّكَ خَيْرٌ مِّمَّا يَجْمَعُونَ,Is it they who apportion the mercy of your Lord? the mercy being prophethood. We have apportioned among them their livelihood in the life of this world making some of them wealthy and others poor and raised some of them in wealth above others by degrees so that some of them who are wealthy may take others who are poor in service disposed to work for them in return for a wage the final yā’ in sukhriyyā is attributive; a variant reading has sikhriyyan; and the mercy of your Lord that is Paradise is better than what they amass in this world.
وَلَوْلاَ أَن يَكُونَ ٱلنَّاسُ أُمَّةً وَاحِدَةً لَّجَعَلْنَا لِمَن يَكْفُرُ بِٱلرَّحْمَـٰنِ لِبُيُوتِهِمْ سُقُفاً مِّن فِضَّةٍ وَمَعَارِجَ عَلَيْهَا يَظْهَرُونَ,And were it not for the danger that mankind would be one community following disbelief We would have made for those who disbelieve in the Compassionate One roofs read saqfan or plural suqufan of silver for their houses li-buyūtihim substitutes for li-man ‘for those who’ and stairs such as steps also of silver by which they ascend by which they go up to the roof;
وَلِبُيُوتِهِمْ أَبْوَاباً وَسُرُراً عَلَيْهَا يَتَّكِئُونَ,and doors of silver for their houses and We would have made for them couches of silver surur ‘couches’ is the plural of sarīr on which they recline
وَزُخْرُفاً وَإِن كُلُّ ذَلِكَ لَمَّا مَتَاعُ ٱلْحَيَاةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَٱلآخِرَةُ عِندَ رَبِّكَ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ,and ornaments gold in other words were it not for fear that a believer might disbelieve as a result of Our giving the disbeliever what has been mentioned We would have given him such luxuries since the affairs of this world represent no danger to Us and he the disbeliever would then have no share in the Bliss of the Hereafter. Yet surely wa-in in is softened from the hardened form inna all that would be nothing read lamā with the mā as extra; or read lammā to mean ‘but’ making the particle in for negation but the transient enjoyment of the life of this world enjoyed during it but then perishes and the Hereafter Paradise with your Lord is for the God-fearing.
وَمَن يَعْشُ عَن ذِكْرِ ٱلرَّحْمَـٰنِ نُقَيِّضْ لَهُ شَيْطَاناً فَهُوَ لَهُ قَرِينٌ,And whoever withdraws from whoever is oblivious to the Remembrance of the Compassionate One namely the Qur’ān We assign We produce for him a devil and he becomes his companion never leaving his side.
وَإِنَّهُمْ لَيَصُدُّونَهُمْ عَنِ ٱلسَّبِيلِ وَيَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّهُم مُّهْتَدُونَ,And indeed they that is the devils bar them the blind from the way from the path of guidance while they suppose that they are rightly guided the plural muhtadūna takes into account the potentially plural sense of man ‘whoever’ of the previous verse
حَتَّىٰ إِذَا جَآءَنَا قَالَ يٰلَيْتَ بَيْنِي وَبَيْنَكَ بُعْدَ ٱلْمَشْرِقَيْنِ فَبِئْسَ ٱلْقَرِينُ,until when he comes to Us such a blind one together with his companion on the Day of Resurrection he says to him ‘O yā is for calling attention would that there were between me and you the distance of the two easts!’ that is to say like the distance between the east and the west What an evil companion then! you are for me. God exalted be He says
وَلَن يَنفَعَكُمُ ٱلْيَوْمَ إِذ ظَّلَمْتُمْ أَنَّكُمْ فِي ٱلْعَذَابِ مُشْتَرِكُونَ,And it your wishes or your remorse will not benefit you blind ones this day given that you did wrong that is to say given that it has become clear to you that you were wrongdoers through your idolatry in this world that you together with your companions will be sharing in the chastisement this constitutes the justification on the basis of an implied lām sc. li-annakum … for the ‘lack of benefit’; idh substitutes for al-yawma ‘this day’.
أَفَأَنتَ تُسْمِعُ ٱلصُّمَّ أَوْ تَهْدِي ٱلْعُمْيَ وَمَن كَانَ فِي ضَلاَلٍ مُّبِينٍ,Can you then make the deaf hear or can you guide the blind and one who is in manifest error? in other words such individuals will not believe.
فَإِمَّا نَذْهَبَنَّ بِكَ فَإِنَّا مِنْهُم مُّنتَقِمُونَ,So if fa-immā the conditional particle in has been assimilated herein with an extra mā We take you away by making you die before chastising them then We will take vengeance on them in the Hereafter;
أَوْ نُرِيَنَّكَ ٱلَّذِي وَعَدْنَاهُمْ فَإِنَّا عَلَيْهِمْ مُّقْتَدِرُونَ,or We show you during your lifetime that which We have promised them in the way of chastisement for surely We have power over surely We are able to chastise them.
فَٱسْتَمْسِكْ بِٱلَّذِيۤ أُوحِيَ إِلَيْكَ إِنَّكَ عَلَىٰ صِرَاطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ,So hold fast to that which has been revealed to you namely the Qur’ān; surely you are on a straight path a straight way.
وَإِنَّهُ لَذِكْرٌ لَّكَ وَلِقَوْمِكَ وَسَوْفَ تُسْأَلُونَ,And it is indeed a Reminder an honour for you and for your people as it has been revealed in their language. And you will eventually be questioned about the extent of your fulfilling your duty towards it.
وَسْئَلْ مَنْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رُّسُلِنَآ أَجَعَلْنَا مِن دُونِ ٱلرَّحْمَـٰنِ آلِهَةً يُعْبَدُونَ,And ask those of Our messengers whom We sent before you Did We ever appoint besides the Compassionate One that is to say any other than Him gods to be worshipped? It is said that this is to be understood literally in other words that God gathered for him all the messengers on the Night of the Journey; but it is also said that this meant that he should ask any communities belonging to either of the two Peoples of the Scripture. According to one of the two opinions he never asked anyone since the point of this command to ask is to affirm to the idolaters of Quraysh that no messenger or scripture ever came from God with the command to worship any other than God.
وَلَقَدْ أَرْسَلْنَا مُوسَىٰ بِآيَـٰتِنَآ إِلَىٰ فِرْعَوْنَ وَمَلإِيْهِ فَقَالَ إِنِّي رَسُولُ رَبِّ ٱلْعَـٰلَمِينَ,And verily We sent Moses with Our signs to Pharaoh and his council namely the Egyptians al-Qibt and he said ‘I am indeed the messenger of the Lord of the Worlds’.
فَلَمَّا جَآءَهُم بِآيَاتِنَآ إِذَا هُم مِّنْهَا يَضْحَكُونَ,But when he brought them Our signs those proving his mission from God behold! they laughed at them.
وَمَا نُرِيِهِم مِّنْ آيَةٍ إِلاَّ هِيَ أَكْبَرُ مِنْ أُخْتِهَا وَأَخَذْنَاهُم بِٱلْعَذَابِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ,And We never showed them a sign from among the signs of chastisement such as the flood which was when the waters of the Nile penetrated their dwellings and for seven days rose as high as their throats as they sat or the chastisement of the locusts but it was greater than the one before it the one immediately preceding it. And We seized them with chastisement that perhaps they might recant their disbelief.
وَقَالُواْ يَٰأَيُّهَ ٱلسَّاحِرُ ٱدْعُ لَنَا رَبَّكَ بِمَا عَهِدَ عِندَكَ إِنَّنَا لَمُهْتَدُونَ,And they said to Moses upon seeing the chastisement ‘O sorcerer! — that is to say ‘O knowledgeable perfect one’ since for them sorcery was an awesome form of knowledge — supplicate your Lord for us by the covenant that He has made with you to the effect that He would relieve us from chastisement if we believe. Assuredly we will be guided’ that is to say we will become believers.
فَلَمَّا كَشَفْنَا عَنْهُمُ ٱلْعَذَابَ إِذَا هُمْ يَنكُثُونَ,But as soon as We relieved them by the supplication of Moses from the chastisement behold! they had broken their pledge reneging on their covenant and persisting in their disbelief.
وَنَادَىٰ فِرْعَوْنُ فِي قَوْمِهِ قَالَ يٰقَوْمِ أَلَيْسَ لِي مُلْكُ مِصْرَ وَهَـٰذِهِ ٱلأَنْهَارُ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِيۤ أَفَلاَ تُبْصِرُونَ,And Pharaoh proclaimed boastfully among his people ‘O my people does not the kingdom of Egypt belong to me and these rivers of the Nile flowing beneath me? that is to say beneath my palaces. Do you not perceive? my magnificence.
أَمْ أَنَآ خَيْرٌ مِّنْ هَـٰذَا ٱلَّذِي هُوَ مَهِينٌ وَلاَ يَكَادُ يُبِينُ,Or do you perceive in which case am I not better than this one namely Moses who is contemptible feeble and lowly and who can scarcely speak clearly? who can scarcely articulate his speech because of his lisp — which was the result of his accidentally placing a hot coal in his mouth when he was a child.
فَلَوْلاَ أُلْقِيَ عَلَيْهِ أَسْوِرَةٌ مِّن ذَهَبٍ أَوْ جَآءَ مَعَهُ ٱلْمَلاَئِكَةُ مُقْتَرِنِينَ,Why then if he were being truthful have bracelets of gold asāwira is the plural of aswira which is the plural of siwār similar in pattern to ghurāb aghriba not been cast on him — as according to their custom with those whom they made their leaders dressing them with gold bracelets and gold necklaces — or the angels not come with him one after the other?’ in succession to testify to his truthfulness.
فَٱسْتَخَفَّ قَوْمَهُ فَأَطَاعُوهُ إِنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ قَوْماً فَاسِقِينَ,Thus did he Pharaoh persuade incite his people and they obeyed him in his wish that Moses be denied. They were truly an immoral folk.
فَلَمَّآ آسَفُونَا ٱنتَقَمْنَا مِنْهُمْ فَأَغْرَقْنَاهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ,So when they had angered Us We took vengeance on them and drowned them all.
فَجَعَلْنَاهُمْ سَلَفاً وَمَثَلاً لِّلآخِرِينَ,And We made them a thing past salaf is the plural of sālif similar in pattern to khādim khadam that is to say a precedent as a lesson and an example for others after them that they posterity might take their predicament as a lesson and so not engage in actions similar to theirs.
وَلَمَّا ضُرِبَ ٱبْنُ مَرْيَمَ مَثَلاً إِذَا قَوْمُكَ مِنْهُ يَصِدُّونَ,And when the son of Mary is cited as an example — after God’s following words were revealed ‘Truly you and what you worship besides God shall be fuel for Hell’ Q. 2198 and the idolaters said ‘We are satisfied that our gods be together with Jesus in Hell for he too was worshipped besides God’ — behold! your people that is the idolaters laugh at it at this example — they clamour with joy at what they hear.
وَقَالُوۤاْ ءَأَ ٰلِهَتُنَا خَيْرٌ أَمْ هُوَ مَا ضَرَبُوهُ لَكَ إِلاَّ جَدَلاً بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ خَصِمُونَ,And they say ‘Are our gods better or he?’ Jesus. We are satisfied that our gods be in the same predicament with him. They only cite this that is the example to you for the sake of contention merely arguing with falsehood for they know that the particle mā of wa-mā ta‘budūna ‘and what you worship’ refers only to non-rational beings and cannot therefore include Jesus peace be upon him. Nay but they are a contentious lot an extremely disputatious folk.
إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ وَجَعَلْنَاهُ مَثَلاً لِّبَنِيۤ إِسْرَائِيلَ,He Jesus is only a servant of Ours on whom We bestowed favour through prophethood and We made him by his coming into being without a father an exemplar for the Children of Israel that is to say like an example because of the wondrousness of his case one from which one is able to infer God’s power exalted be He to do whatever He will.
وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لَجَعَلْنَا مِنكُمْ مَّلاَئِكَةً فِي ٱلأَرْضِ يَخْلُفُونَ,And had We willed We would have appointed among you instead of you angels to be your successors in the earth by Our destroying you.
وَإِنَّهُ لَعِلْمٌ لِّلسَّاعَةِ فَلاَ تَمْتَرُنَّ بِهَا وَٱتَّبِعُونِ هَـٰذَا صِرَاطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ,And indeed he that is Jesus is a portent of the Hour — the arrival of it is known by the sending down of him — so do not doubt it tamtarunna the indicative nūn has been omitted for apocopation together with the wāw of the third person plural on account of two unvowelled consonants coming together but say to them ‘Follow me in the affirmation of God’s Oneness. This to which I command you is a straight path’.
وَلاَ يَصُدَّنَّكُمُ ٱلشَّيْطَانُ إِنَّهُ لَكُمْ عَدُوٌّ مُّبِينٌ,And do not let Satan bar you do not let him turn you away from God’s religion. Indeed he is a manifest enemy of yours one whose enmity is manifest.
وَلَمَّا جَآءَ عِيسَىٰ بِٱلْبَيِّنَاتِ قَالَ قَدْ جِئْتُكُم بِٱلْحِكْمَةِ وَلأُبَيِّنَ لَكُم بَعْضَ ٱلَّذِي تَخْتَلِفُونَ فِيهِ فَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَأَطِيعُونِ,And when Jesus came with the clear signs the miracles and the prescriptions of the Law he said ‘Verily I have brought you wisdom prophethood and the prescriptions of the Gospel and I have come to make clear to you some of what you are at variance over in the way of the rulings of the Torah for what concerns religion and otherwise — and he indeed made clear to them the matters of religion. So fear God and obey me.
إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ هُوَ رَبِّي وَرَبُّكُمْ فَٱعْبُدُوهُ هَـٰذَا صِرَاطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ,Assuredly God is my Lord and your Lord; so worship Him — that is a straight path’.
فَٱخْتَلَفَ ٱلأَحْزَابُ مِن بَيْنِهِمْ فَوَيْلٌ لِّلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ مِنْ عَذَابِ يَوْمٍ أَلِيمٍ,But the factions differed among themselves regarding the status of Jesus was he God or the son of God or the third of Three deities? So woe waylun is a term implying chastisement to those who do wrong those who blaspheme in what they say about Jesus from the chastisement of a painful day.
هَلْ يَنظُرُونَ إِلاَّ ٱلسَّاعَةَ أَن تَأْتِيَهُمْ بَغْتَةً وَهُمْ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ,Are they that is the Meccan disbelievers awaiting anything that is to say — they are in fact awaiting nothing — but that Hour should come upon them an ta’tiyahum substitutes for al-sā‘ata ‘the Hour’ suddenly unexpectedly while they are unaware? of the time of its coming beforehand.
ٱلأَخِلاَّءُ يَوْمَئِذٍ بَعْضُهُمْ لِبَعْضٍ عَدُوٌّ إِلاَّ ٱلْمُتَّقِينَ,Friends who shared in acts of disobedience in this world will on that day the Day of Resurrection yawma’idhin is semantically connected to His following words be foes of one another except for the God-fearing those who have love for one another through their commitment to obedience of God — such will be friends on that day and it will be said to them
يٰعِبَادِ لاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْكُمُ ٱلْيَوْمَ وَلاَ أَنتُمْ تَحْزَنُونَ,‘O My servants there is no fear for you this day nor will you grieve
ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ بِآيَاتِنَا وَكَانُواْ مُسْلِمِينَ,those who believed alladhīna āmanū adjectivally qualifies ‘ibādī ‘My servants’ in Our signs — the Qur’ān — and had submitted themselves to Me.
ٱدْخُلُواْ ٱلْجَنَّةَ أَنتُمْ وَأَزْوَاجُكُمْ تُحْبَرُونَ,Enter Paradise you antum the subject and your spouses your wives to be made joyful to be made happy and to be honoured tuhbarūna ‘to be made joyful’ is the predicate of the above subject.
يُطَافُ عَلَيْهِمْ بِصِحَافٍ مِّن ذَهَبٍ وَأَكْوَابٍ وَفِيهَا مَا تَشْتَهِيهِ ٱلأَنْفُسُ وَتَلَذُّ ٱلأَعْيُنُ وَأَنتُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ,They will be served from all around with large dishes of gold and goblets akwāb is the plural of kūb which is a drinking vessel without a handle so that the person can drink from whichever side he wants and therein will be whatever souls desire to relish and eyes delight in contemplating and you will abide in it forever.
وَتِلْكَ ٱلْجَنَّةُ ٱلَّتِيۤ أُورِثْتُمُوهَا بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ,And that is the Paradise which you have been given to inherit as the reward for what you used to do.
لَكُمْ فِيهَا فَاكِهَةٌ كَثِيرَةٌ مِّنْهَا تَأْكُلُونَ,Therein are abundant fruits for you from which that is parts of which you will eat’ for whatever is eaten is immediately replaced with more of the same.
إِنَّ ٱلْمُجْرِمِينَ فِي عَذَابِ جَهَنَّمَ خَالِدُونَ,Indeed the guilty will abide forever in the chastisement of Hell —
لاَ يُفَتَّرُ عَنْهُمْ وَهُمْ فِيهِ مُبْلِسُونَ,it will not be lightened for them and they will be utterly despondent in it silent in despair.
وَمَا ظَلَمْنَاهُمْ وَلَـٰكِن كَانُواْ هُمُ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ,And We never wronged them but they themselves were the wrongdoers.
وَنَادَوْاْ يٰمَالِكُ لِيَقْضِ عَلَيْنَا رَبُّكَ قَالَ إِنَّكُمْ مَّاكِثُونَ,And they will call out ‘O Mālik — the name of the Keeper of the Fire — let your Lord finish us off!’ let Him make us die. He will say after the passing of a thousand years ‘You will surely remain!’ you will remain in the chastisement forever.

وَتَبَارَكَ ٱلَّذِي لَهُ مُلْكُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا وَعِندَهُ عِلْمُ ٱلسَّاعَةِ وَإِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ,And Blessed Magnificent be He to Whom belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them; and with Him is the knowledge of the Hour of when it shall come to pass and to Him they will all be returned yurja‘ūna may also be read second person plural turja‘ūna ‘you will be returned’.

How can they then deviate? how can they be turned away from worshipping God?
وَقِيلِهِ يٰرَبِّ إِنَّ هَـٰؤُلاَءِ قَوْمٌ لاَّ يُؤْمِنُونَ,And as for his saying that is the saying of the Prophet Muhammad (s) wa-qīlihi is accusative dependent because it is a verbal noun followed by an implicit verb in other words wa-qāla qīlihi ‘and he said his saying’ ‘O my Lord! These are indeed a people who have no faith’.

مَنْ عَمِلَ صَـٰلِحاً فَلِنَفْسِهِ وَمَنْ أَسَآءَ فَعَلَيْهَا ثُمَّ إِلَىٰ رَبِّكُمْ تُرْجَعُونَ,Whoever acts righteously it is for the benefit of his own soul that he acts so and whoever does evil it is to the detriment thereof that he has done evil; then to your Lord you will be returned with your Lord you shall end up whereupon He will requite the one of righteous deeds and the evildoer.
وَلَقَدْ آتَيْنَا بَنِيۤ إِسْرَائِيلَ ٱلْكِتَابَ وَٱلْحُكْمَ وَٱلنُّبُوَّةَ وَرَزَقْنَاهُمْ مِّنَ ٱلطَّيِّبَاتِ وَفَضَّلْنَاهُمْ عَلَى ٱلْعَالَمينَ,And verily We gave the Children of Israel the Scripture the Torah and the means of judgement therewith between people and prophethood for Moses and Aaron among them and We provided them with the good things the lawful things such as manna and quails and We favoured them above all worlds the worlds of their time that is above all other rational beings.
وَآتَيْنَاهُم بَيِّنَاتٍ مِّنَ ٱلأَمْرِ فَمَا ٱخْتَلَفُوۤاْ إِلاَّ مِن بَعْدِ مَا جَآءَهُمُ ٱلْعِلْمُ بَغْياً بَيْنَهُمْ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ يَقْضِي بَيْنَهُمْ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ فِيمَا كَانُواْ فِيهِ يَخْتَلِفُونَ,And We gave them clear illustrations of the commandment the commandment of religion in the way of what is lawful or unlawful and the Mission of Muhammad (s) upon whom be the most excellent blessings and peace. And they did not differ regarding his Mission except after the knowledge had come to them out of rivalry among themselves that is to say because of some rivalry that came about among them out of envy of him. Surely your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that in which they used to differ.
ثُمَّ جَعَلْنَاكَ عَلَىٰ شَرِيعَةٍ مِّنَ ٱلأَمْرِ فَٱتَّبِعْهَا وَلاَ تَتَّبِعْ أَهْوَآءَ ٱلَّذِينَ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ,Then We set you O Muhammad (s) upon a clear course a clear way of the commandment the commandment of religion; so follow it and do not follow the desires of those who do not know in worshipping other than God.
إِنَّهُمْ لَن يُغْنُواْ عَنكَ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ شَيْئاً وَإِنَّ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ بَعْضُهُمْ أَوْلِيَآءُ بَعْضٍ وَٱللَّهُ وَلِيُّ ٱلْمُتَّقِينَ,Assuredly they will not avail they will not protect you in any way against God against His chastisement. And assuredly the wrongdoers the disbelievers are allies of one another; but God is the ally only of the God-fearing.
هَـٰذَا بَصَائِرُ لِلنَّاسِ وَهُدًى وَرَحْمَةٌ لِّقَوْمٍ يُوقِنُونَ,This Qur’ān is a set of insights for mankind guideposts with which they can discern God’s rulings and legal proscriptions and guidance and mercy for a people who have certainty with regard to the truth of the Resurrection.
أَمْ حَسِبَ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱجْتَرَحُواْ ٱلسَّيِّئَاتِ أَن نَّجْعَلَهُمْ كَٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ سَوَآءً مَّحْيَاهُمْ وَمَمَاتُهُمْ سَآءَ مَا يَحْكُمُونَ,Or am has the significance of the rhetorical hamza of denial do those who have perpetrated evil acts such as disbelief and disobedience suppose that We shall treat them as those who believe and perform righteous deeds equally sawā’an is the predicate in their life and in their death? mahyāhum wa-mamātuhum this clause constitutes the subject and a supplement; the sentence itself is a substitution for the kāf of ka’lladhīna ‘as those’ and both suffixed pronouns -hum refer to the disbelievers. The meaning is do they suppose that in the Hereafter We will assign them a good fate like believers that they will enjoy a life of plenty one equal to their life in this world as when they said to the believers ‘Surely if we were to be resurrected we will be given the same good things that you will be given!’ God exalted be He says in accordance with His denial implicit in the rhetorical interrogative hamza How evil is that judgement which they make! In other words it will not be so for in the Hereafter they will be suffering in the chastisement in contrast to their lives in this world; the believers on the other hand will be delighting in the Reward in the Hereafter because of their righteous deeds in this world such as their observance of prayers their alms-giving fasting and otherwise the mā ‘that … which’ relates to the verbal action that is to say ba’isa hukman hukmuhum hādhā ‘awful as a judgement is this judgement of theirs’.
وَخَلَقَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضَ بِٱلْحَقِّ وَلِتُجْزَىٰ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ بِمَا كَسَبَتْ وَهُمْ لاَ يُظْلَمُونَ,And God created the heavens and He created the earth with the truth bi’l-haqqi is semantically connected to khalaqa ‘He created’ so that He may indicate His power and His Oneness and so that every soul may be requited for what it has earned in the way of acts of disobedience or obedience and therefore the disbeliever cannot be equal to the believer and they will not be wronged.
أَفَرَأَيْتَ مَنِ ٱتَّخَذَ إِلَـٰهَهُ هَوَاهُ وَأَضَلَّهُ ٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ عِلْمٍ وَخَتَمَ عَلَىٰ سَمْعِهِ وَقَلْبِهِ وَجَعَلَ عَلَىٰ بَصَرِهِ غِشَاوَةً فَمَن يَهْدِيهِ مِن بَعْدِ ٱللَّهِ أَفَلاَ تَذَكَّرُونَ,Have you then seen inform Me about him who has taken as his god his own desire that is whatever new stone he may desire after having desired some other stone considering this new one to be better and whom God has led astray knowingly on His part exalted be He that is to say knowing him to be of those who follow misguidance before he was created and set a seal upon his hearing and his heart so that he cannot hear guidance or understand it and laid a covering a darkness over his sight? so that he cannot perceive guidance here one should understand as implied the second direct object of the verb a-ra’ayta ‘have you seen’ namely a-yahtadī ‘can he find guidance?. So who will guide him after God? that is to say after His leading him astray? In other words he will not find guidance. Will you not then remember? will you not then be admonished? tadhakkarūna one of the two tā’ letters of the original form tatadhakkarūna has been assimilated with the dhāl.
وَقَالُواْ مَا هِيَ إِلاَّ حَيَاتُنَا ٱلدُّنْيَا نَمُوتُ وَنَحْيَا وَمَا يُهْلِكُنَآ إِلاَّ ٱلدَّهْرُ وَمَا لَهُمْ بِذَلِكَ مِنْ عِلْمٍ إِنْ هُمْ إِلاَّ يَظُنُّونَ,And they those who deny the Resurrection say ‘There is only that is to say the only life is our life the one that is in this world. We die and we live that is to say some die while others are given life by virtue of being born and nothing but time that is nothing but the passage of time destroys us’. God exalted be He says Of that saying they have no knowledge; they are only making conjectures.
وَإِذَا تُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْهِمْ ءَايَٰتُنَا بَيِّنَاتٍ مَّا كَانَ حُجَّتَهُمْ إِلاَّ أَن قَالُواْ ٱئْتُواْ بِآبَآئِنَآ إِن كُنتُمْ صَادِقِينَ,And when Our signs of the Qur’ān indicating Our power to resurrect are recited to them being clear signs evident signs bayyinātin ‘clear signs’ is a circumstantial qualifier their only argument is to say ‘Bring us our fathers alive if you are being truthful’ when you say that we will be resurrected.
قُلِ ٱللَّهُ يُحْيِيكُمْ ثُمَّ يُمِيتُكُمْ ثُمَّ يَجْمَعُكُمْ إِلَىٰ يَوْمِ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ لاَ رَيْبَ فِيهِ وَلَـٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ ٱلنَّاسِ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ,Say ‘God is the One Who gives you life when you are sperm-drops then makes you die then gathers you alive to the Day of Resurrection in which there is no doubt; but most people and these are the one who say the above-mentioned do not know’.
وَلِلَّهِ مُلْكُ ٱلسَّمَاوَاتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَيَوْمَ تَقُومُ ٱلسَّاَعةُ يَوْمَئِذٍ يَخْسَرُ ٱلْمُبْطِلُونَ,And to God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. And on the day when the Hour sets in yawma taqūmu’l-sā‘atu is substituted by the following yawma’idhin on that day the followers of falsehood the disbelievers will be losers that is to say their loss will become manifest by their ending up in the Fire.
وَتَرَىٰ كُلَّ أُمَّةٍ جَاثِيَةً كُلُّ أمَّةٍ تُدْعَىٰ إِلَىٰ كِتَابِهَا ٱلْيَوْمَ تُجْزَوْنَ مَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ,And you will see every community that is all members of a religion crouching on their knees — or jāthiya means ‘gathered together’. Every community will be summoned to its record the record of its deeds and it will be said to them ‘Today you will be requited for what you used to do that is you will be given the desert thereof.
هَـٰذَا كِتَابُنَا يَنطِقُ عَلَيْكُم بِٱلْحَقِّ إِنَّا كُنَّا نَسْتَنسِخُ مَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ,This is Our book the register of deeds recorded by the guardian angels which pronounces against you with truth. Indeed We used to write down record and preserve what you used to do’.
فَأَمَّا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ فَيُدْخِلُهُمْ رَبُّهُمْ فِي رَحْمَتِهِ ذَلِكَ هُوَ ٱلْفَوْزُ ٱلْمُبِينُ,So as for those who believed and performed righteous deeds their Lord will admit them into His mercy His Paradise. That is the manifest triumph the clear and evident triumph.
وَأَمَّا ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوۤاْ أَفَلَمْ تَكُنْ ءَايَٰتِى تُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْكُمْ فَٱسْتَكْبَرْتُمْ وَكُنتُمْ قَوْماً مُّجْرِمِينَ,But as for those who disbelieved it will be said to them ‘Were not My signs was not the Qur’ān recited to you but you were disdainful you were arrogant and were a guilty a disbelieving lot?
وَإِذَا قِيلَ إِنَّ وعْدَ ٱللَّهِ حَقٌّ وَٱلسَّاعَةُ لاَ رَيْبَ فِيهَا قُلْتُم مَّا نَدْرِي مَا ٱلسَّاعَةُ إِن نَّظُنُّ إِلاَّ ظَنّاً وَمَا نَحْنُ بِمُسْتَيْقِنِينَ,And when it was said to you O disbelievers “God’s promise of resurrection is indeed true and there is no doubt about the Hour” read al-sā‘atu or al-sā‘ata you said “We do not know what the Hour is. We only make conjectures al-Mubarrad said that this actually means in nahnu illā nazunnu zannan and we are by no means certain” ’ that it will come to pass.
وَبَدَا لَهُمْ سَيِّئَاتُ مَا عَمِلُواْ وَحَاقَ بِهِم مَّا كَانُواْ بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِئُونَ,And there will appear before them in the Hereafter the evils of what they did in this world that is to say the requital thereof and they will be besieged by there shall befall them what they used to deride namely the chastisement of the Hereafter.
وَقِيلَ ٱلْيَوْمَ نَنسَاكُمْ كَمَا نَسِيتُمْ لِقَآءَ يَوْمِكُمْ هَـٰذَا وَمَأْوَاكُمُ ٱلنَّارُ وَمَا لَكُمْ مِّن نَّاصِرِينَ,And it will be said ‘Today We will forget you We will abandon you in the Fire just as you forgot the encounter of this day of yours that is to say just as you neglected to perform those good deeds in preparation for the encounter with it and your abode will be the Fire and you will not have any helpers any protectors therefrom.
ذَلِكُم بِأَنَّكُمُ ٱتَّخَذْتُمْ ءَايَٰتِ ٱللَّهِ هُزُواً وَغَرَّتْكُمُ ٱلْحَيَاةُ ٱلدُّنْيَا فَٱلْيَوْمَ لاَ يُخْرَجُونَ مِنْهَا وَلاَ هُمْ يُسْتَعَتَبُونَ,That is because you took God’s signs the Qur’ān in mockery and the life of this world deceived you’ to the extent that you said ‘There is neither Resurrection nor Reckoning’. So today they will not be brought out read either active yakhrujūna ‘they will not come out’ or passive yukhrajūna ‘they will not be brought out’ of it of the Fire nor will they asked to make amends they will not be asked to try to attain the pleasure of their Lord by repenting or being obedient for such action will be of no use then.
فَلِلَّهِ ٱلْحَمْدُ رَبِّ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَرَبِّ ٱلأَرْضِ رَبِّ ٱلْعَالَمِينَ,So to God belongs all praise the attribution to Him of what is beautiful in words for fulfilling His promise regarding the deniers; Lord of the heavens and Lord of the earth the Lord of the Worlds the Creator of all that has been mentioned ‘ālam ‘world’ denotes everything other than God; it is in the plural ‘ālamīn because of the different types of beings in them; rabbi ‘Lord’ in the last clause is a substitution for the previous ones.
وَلَهُ ٱلْكِبْرِيَآءُ فِي ٱلسَّمَاوَاتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَهُوَ ٱلْعِزِيزُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ,And to Him belongs all grandeur all majesty in the heavens and the earth fī’l-samāwāti wa’l-ardi is a circumstantial qualifier and He is the Mighty the Wise — as explained in a similar statement above.
حـمۤ,Hā mīm God knows best what He means by these letters.
تَنزِيلُ ٱلْكِتَابِ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ ٱلْعَزِيزِ ٱلْحَكِيمِ,The revelation of the Book the Qur’ān tanzīlu’l-kitābi the subject is from God mina’Llāhi the predicate thereof the Mighty in His kingdom the Wise in His actions.
مَا خَلَقْنَا ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضَ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَآ إِلاَّ بِٱلْحَقِّ وَأَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّى وَٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ عَمَّآ أُنذِرُواْ مُعْرِضُونَ,We have not created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them except as a creation in truth so that it may be an indication of Our power and Our Oneness and for an appointed term until the point of their annihilation on the Day of Resurrection. Yet those who disbelieve are disregardful of what they are warned of what they are threatened with in the way of impending chastisement.
قُلْ أَرَأَيْتُمْ مَّا تَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ أَرُونِي مَاذَا خَلَقُواْ مِنَ ٱلأَرْضِ أَمْ لَهُمْ شِرْكٌ فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ ٱئْتُونِي بِكِتَابٍ مِّن قَبْلِ هَـٰذَآ أَوْ أَثَارَةٍ مِّنْ عِلْمٍ إِن كُنتُمْ صَادِقِينَ,Say ‘Have you considered say Inform me about what you invoke what you worship besides God? namely the idols min dūni’Llāhi constitutes the first object of the verb. Show me — inform me — arūnī repeated for emphasis what they have created mādhā khalaqū the second object of the earth mina’l-ardi the explication of mā ‘what part’. Or do they have any share any partnership in the creation of the heavens? with God? am ‘or’ has the significance of the rhetorical interrogative hamza of denial. Bring me a scripture that has been revealed before this Qur’ān or some vestige some remnant of knowledge transmitted from the ancients confirming the soundness of your claim that your worship of the idols brings you closer to God if you are truthful’ in your claim.
وَمَنْ أَضَلُّ مِمَّن يَدْعُواْ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ مَن لاَّ يَسْتَجِيبُ لَهُ إِلَىٰ يَوْمِ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ وَهُمْ عَن دُعَآئِهِمْ غَافِلُونَ,And who is man here is interrogative but meant rhetorically as a negation in other words ‘no one is’ further astray than him who invokes him who worships besides God that is to say other than Him such as would not respond to him even until the Day of Resurrection — these are the idols who never answer those who worship them in anything that they ask for — and who are heedless of their supplication? their worship because they are inanimates that possess no faculty of comprehension.
وَإِذَا حُشِرَ ٱلنَّاسُ كَانُواْ لَهُمْ أَعْدَآءً وَكَانُواْ بِعِبَادَتِهِمْ كَافِرِينَ,And when mankind are gathered they the idols will be enemies to them to those who had worshipped them and they will deny they will disavow their worship the worship of those who had worshipped them.
وَإِذَا تُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْهِمْ آيَاتُنَا بَيِّنَاتٍ قَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لِلْحَقِّ لَمَّا جَآءَهُمْ هَـٰذَا سِحْرٌ مُّبِينٌ,And when Our signs the Qur’ān are recited to them namely to the people of Mecca being clear signs manifest signs bayyinātin is a circumstantial qualifier those who disbelieve from among them say of the truth that is the Qur’ān when it comes to them ‘This is plain sorcery!’ clear and evident sorcery.
أَمْ يَقُولُونَ ٱفْتَرَاهُ قُلْ إِنِ ٱفْتَرَيْتُهُ فَلاَ تَمْلِكُونَ لِي مِنَ ٱللَّهِ شَيْئاً هُوَ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا تُفِيضُونَ فِيهِ كَفَىٰ بِهِ شَهِيداً بَيْنِي وَبَيْنَكُمْ وَهُوَ ٱلْغَفُورُ ٱلرَّحِيمُ,Or am has the significance of bal ‘nay but …’ and the rhetorical interrogative hamza of denial do they say ‘He has invented it?’ that is the Qur’ān. Say ‘If I have invented it hypothetically speaking still you would have no power to avail me against God that is to say against His chastisement in any way in other words you would not be able to ward it off from me if God chooses to chastise me. He knows best what you delve into of gossip concerning it what you say about the Qur’ān. He exalted be He suffices as a witness between me and you. And He is the Forgiving to the one who repents the Merciful’ to him and so He does not hasten to punish you.
قُلْ مَا كُنتُ بِدْعاً مِّنَ ٱلرُّسُلِ وَمَآ أَدْرِي مَا يُفْعَلُ بِي وَلاَ بِكُمْ إِنْ أَتَّبِعُ إِلاَّ مَا يُوحَىٰ إِلَيَّ وَمَآ أَنَاْ إِلاَّ نَذِيرٌ مُّبِينٌ,Say ‘I am not a novelty unprecedented among the messengers that is to say I am not the first to be sent by God as His Messenger. Already many of them have come before me so how can you deny me? Nor do I know what will be done with me or with you in this world will I be made to leave my native land or will I be slain as was done with some prophets before me or will you stone me to death or will the earth be made to swallow you as it did deniers before you? I only follow what is revealed to me that is the Qur’ān and I do not invent anything myself. And I am only a plain warner’ one whose warning is plain.
قُلْ أَرَأَيْتُمْ إِن كَانَ مِنْ عِندِ ٱللَّهِ وَكَفَرْتُمْ بِهِ وَشَهِدَ شَاهِدٌ مِّن بَنِيۤ إِسْرَائِيلَ عَلَىٰ مِثْلِهِ فَآمَنَ وَٱسْتَكْبَرْتُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لاَ يَهْدِي ٱلْقَوْمَ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ,Say ‘Have you considered? say inform me what will be your predicament if it the Qur’ān is from God and you disbelieve in it wa-kafartum bihi the sentence is a circumstantial qualifier and a witness from the Children of Israel has already testified this was ‘Abd Allāh b. Salām to the like of it that is to say to it the Qur’ān that it is from God and he the witness has believed in it while you act with arrogance …’ you are disdainful of faith the response to the conditional ‘if …’ is given by implication in what has been supplemented to it in other words ‘Would you not then be considered wrongdoers?’; this understanding of the response is indicated by what follows. Truly God does not guide wrongdoing folk’.
وَقَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لِلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ لَوْ كَانَ خَيْراً مَّا سَبَقُونَآ إِلَيْهِ وَإِذْ لَمْ يَهْتَدُواْ بِهِ فَسَيَقُولُونَ هَـٰذَآ إِفْكٌ قَدِيمٌ,And those who disbelieve say of those who believe that is they say with regards to them ‘Had it faith been anything good they would not have attained it before us’. And since they the ones now speaking will not be guided by it that is by the Qur’ān they say ‘This that is the Qur’ān is an ancient lie!’
وَمِن قَبْلِهِ كِتَابُ مُوسَىٰ إِمَاماً وَرَحْمَةً وَهَـٰذَا كِتَابٌ مُّصَدِّقٌ لِّسَاناً عَرَبِيّاً لِّيُنذِرَ ٱلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ وَبُشْرَىٰ لِلْمُحْسِنِينَ,Yet before it that is before the Qur’ān there was the Book of Moses that is the Torah as a guidepost and a mercy for those who believed in it imāman wa-rahmatan are two circumstantial qualifiers and this Qur’ān is a Book that confirms scriptures before it in the Arabic tongue lisānan ‘arabiyyan is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the subject of musaddiqun ‘that confirms’ to warn those who do wrong the idolaters of Mecca and it is good tidings for the virtuous the believers.
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ قَالُواْ رَبُّنَا ٱللَّهُ ثُمَّ ٱسْتَقَامُواْ فَلاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلاَ هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ,Assuredly those who say ‘Our Lord is God’ and then remain upright in their adherence to obedience no fear will befall them nor will they grieve.
أُوْلَـٰئِكَ أَصْحَابُ ٱلْجَنَّةِ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا جَزَآءً بِمَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ,Those will be the inhabitants of Paradise abiding therein khālidīna fīhā is a circumstantial qualifier as a reward jazā’an is in the accusative as a verbal noun because of the implied verbal action that is to say yujzawna ‘they will be rewarded’ for what they used to do.
وَوَصَّيْنَا ٱلإِنسَانَ بِوَٰلِدَيْهِ إِحْسَاناً حَمَلَتْهُ أُمُّهُ كُرْهاً وَوَضَعَتْهُ كُرْهاً وَحَمْلُهُ وَفِصَٰلُهُ ثَلٰثُونَ شَهْراً حَتَّىٰ إِذَا بَلَغَ أَشُدَّهُ وَبَلَغَ أَرْبَعِينَ سَنَةً قَالَ رَبِّ أَوْزِعْنِيۤ أَنْ أَشكُرَ نِعْمَتَكَ ٱلَّتِيۤ أَنْعَمْتَ عَلَيَّ وَعَلَىٰ وَالِدَيَّ وَأَنْ أَعْمَلَ صَٰلِحاً تَرْضَٰهُ وَأَصْلِحْ لِي فِي ذُرِّيَّتِيۤ إِنِّي تُبْتُ إِلَيْكَ وَإِنِّي مِنَ ٱلْمُسْلِمِينَ,And We have enjoined man to be kind husnan a variant reading has ihsānan that is to say We have commanded him to act kindly towards both of them thus ihsānan is in the accusative as a verbal noun because of the implied verbal action; the same applies to husnan to his parents. His mother carries him in travail and gives birth to him in travail that is to say with suffering; and his gestation and his weaning from suckling take thirty months six months being the minimum period for gestation the remainder being the maximum period of suckling; it is also said that regardless of whether she bore him for six or nine months she should suckle him for the remainder. So that hattā is a particle of purpose for an implied sentence that is to say wa-‘āsha hattā ‘and he lived on so that …’ when he is mature namely at his prime in terms of his strength intellect and reasoning the minimum age for which is thirty or thirty three years and reaches forty years that is exactly forty years which is the maximum for attaining maturity he says ‘My Lord! this to the end of this verse was revealed regarding Abū Bakr al-Siddīq when he had reached forty years of age two years after the beginning of the Prophet’s Mission s. He Abū Bakr believed in him whereafter his parents believed in the Prophet followed by his son ‘Abd al-Rahmān then ‘Abd al-Rahmān’s son Abū ‘Atīq Muhammad b. ‘Abd al-Rahmān. Inspire me to give thanks for Your favour with which You have favoured me and my parents namely the grace of affirming God’s Oneness and that I may act righteously in a way that will please You thus he Abū Bakr emancipated nine believers who had been enduring torture at the hands of the idolaters for their belief in God and invest my seed with righteousness all of them were believers. Indeed I repent to You and I am truly of those who submit to You’.
أُوْلَـٰئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ نَتَقَبَّلُ عَنْهُمْ أَحْسَنَ مَا عَمِلُواْ وَنَتَجَاوَزُ عَن سَيِّئَاتِهِمْ فِيۤ أَصْحَابِ ٱلْجَنَّةِ وَعْدَ ٱلصِّدْقِ ٱلَّذِي كَانُواْ يُوعَدُونَ,Those that is those who say such words Abū Bakr and others are they from whom We accept the best of what they do and overlook their misdeeds as they stand among the inhabitants of Paradise fī ashābi’ll-jannati a circumstantial qualifier in other words ‘being among them’ — this is the true promise which they were promised by His words God has promised the believers both men and women Gardens … Q. 972.
وَٱلَّذِي قَالَ لِوَالِدَيْهِ أُفٍّ لَّكُمَآ أَتَعِدَانِنِيۤ أَنْ أُخْرَجَ وَقَدْ خَلَتِ ٱلْقُرُونُ مِن قَبْلِي وَهُمَا يَسْتَغِيثَانِ ٱللَّهَ وَيْلَكَ آمِنْ إِنَّ وَعْدَ ٱللَّهِ حَقٌّ فَيَقُولُ مَا هَـٰذَآ إِلاَّ أَسَاطِيرُ ٱلأَوَّلِينَ,As for him who says to his parents li-wālidayhi a variant reading has li-wālidihi ‘his parent’ denoting the generic noun ‘Fie read uffin or uffan as a verbal noun meaning ‘something putrid and disgusting’ on you both I am exasperated at both of you. Do you threaten me a-ta‘idāninī a variant reading has a-ta‘idānnī that I shall be raised from the grave when already generations communities have passed away before me?’ and they have not been raised from their graves. And they call on God for succour that he their child repent saying to him if you do not repent ‘Woe to you waylaka that is to say halākaka ‘you are ruined!’. Believe! in resurrection. Surely God’s promise is true’. But he says ‘This belief in resurrection is nothing but the fables of the ancients’ lies of theirs.
أُوْلَـٰئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ حَقَّ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلْقَوْلُ فِيۤ أُمَمٍ قَدْ خَلَتْ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ مِّنَ ٱلْجِنِّ وَٱلإِنسِ إِنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ خَاسِرِينَ,Such are the ones against whom the Word of chastisement is due is necessary concerning communities of jinn and humans that have passed away before them. Truly they are losers.
وَلِكُلٍّ دَرَجَٰتٌ مِّمَّا عَمِلُواْ وَلِيُوَفِّيَهُمْ أَعْمَٰلَهُمْ وَهُمْ لاَ يُظْلَمُونَ,And for each one of both categories believer and disbeliever there will be degrees of status thus the degrees of the believers in Paradise are high while the degrees of disbelievers in the Fire are despicable according to what they have done that is to say according to what believers have done in the way of acts of obedience and disbelievers in the way of acts of disobedience and that He may recompense them fully namely God li-yuwaffiyahum a variant reading has li-nuwaffiyahum ‘that We may recompense them fully’ for their deeds that is pay them their deserts and they will not be wronged not even in a single thing that may be diminished for believers or increased for disbelievers.
وَيَوْمَ يُعْرَضُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ عَلَى ٱلنَّارِ أَذْهَبْتُمْ طَيِّبَـٰتِكُمْ فِي حَيَاتِكُمُ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَٱسْتَمْتَعْتُمْ بِهَا فَٱلْيَوْمَ تُجْزَوْنَ عَذَابَ ٱلْهُونِ بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَسْتَكْبِرُونَ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ بِغَيْرِ ٱلْحَقِّ وَبِمَا كُنتُمْ تَفْسُقُونَ,And on the day when those who disbelieve are exposed to the Fire by its being revealed for them it will be said to them ‘You squandered read with one hamza adhhabtum or with two hamzas as an interrogative a-adhhabtum ‘have you sqaundered …?’; or with one hamza adhhabtum or with an initial long ‘a’ ādhhabtum with both of these pronounced fully or without pronouncing the second hamza your good things during your life of the world by preoccupying yourselves with sensual delights and enjoyed them. So today you will be requited with the chastisement of humiliation in return for acting arrogantly in the earth without right and in return for that regarding which you used to act immorally’ and for the torture you used to inflict upon others therein.
وَٱذْكُرْ أَخَا عَادٍ إِذْ أَنذَرَ قَوْمَهُ بِٱلأَحْقَافِ وَقَدْ خَلَتِ ٱلنُّذُرُ مِن بَيْنِ يَدَيْهِ وَمِنْ خَلْفِهِ أَلاَّ تَعْبُدُوۤاْ إِلاَّ ٱللَّهَ إِنَّيۤ أَخَافُ عَلَيْكُمْ عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ,And mention the brother of ‘Ād namely Hūd peace be upon him when idh … from here to the end of the verse constitutes an inclusive substitution he warned his people he threatened them at Ahqāf ‘the Sand dunes’ is the name of a valley in Yemen where their dwellings were located — and already warners messengers had passed away before him and after him that is to say before Hūd came to them and after him to their peoples — saying ‘Do not worship anyone but God the statement beginning with wa-qad khalat ‘and already warners had passed away’ is a parenthetical one. Truly I fear for you — should you worship other than God — the chastisement of a dreadful day’.
قَالُوۤاْ أَجِئْتَنَا لِتَأْفِكَنَا عَنْ آلِهَتِنَا فَأْتِنَا بِمَا تَعِدُنَآ إِن كُنتَ مِنَ ٱلصَّادِقِينَ,They said ‘Have you come to divert us from our gods? to turn us away from worship of them. Then bring us what you threaten us with of chastisement for worshipping them if you are of the truthful’ in saying that it will befall us.
قَالَ إِنَّمَا ٱلْعِلْمُ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ وَأُبَلِّغُكُمْ مَّآ أُرْسِلْتُ بِهِ وَلَـٰكِنِّيۤ أَرَاكُمْ قَوْماً تَجْهَلُونَ,He Hūd said ‘The knowledge is with God only He is the One Who knows when chastisement will befall you and I am merely conveying to you what I have been sent with to you. But I see that you are an ignorant lot’ given your hastening on of the chastisement.
فَلَمَّا رَأَوْهُ عَارِضاً مُّسْتَقْبِلَ أَوْدِيَتِهِمْ قَالُواْ هَـٰذَا عَارِضٌ مُّمْطِرُنَا بَلْ هُوَ مَا ٱسْتَعْجَلْتُم بِهِ رِيحٌ فِيهَا عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,Then when they saw it that is when they saw what chastisement really was as a sudden cloud a cloud that appeared out of nowhere on the horizon heading towards their valleys they said ‘This is a cloud that will bring us rain!’. God exalted be He says Nay but it is what you sought to hasten of the chastisement — a hurricane rīhun substitutes for mā ‘what’ containing a painful chastisement
تُدَمِّرُ كُلَّ شَيْءٍ بِأَمْرِ رَبِّهَا فَأْصْبَحُواْ لاَ يُرَىٰ إِلاَّ مَسَاكِنُهُمْ كَذَلِكَ نَجْزِي ٱلْقَوْمَ ٱلْمُجْرِمِينَ,destroying ruining everything it passes through by the command of its Lord by His will that is to say destroying everything that He wants to destroy with it. And so it destroyed their men women children and properties by flinging them up into the air high above the ground and tearing them to pieces. Only Hūd and those who believed with him remained unscathed. So they became such that nothing could be seen except their dwellings. Thus in the way that We requited them do We requite guilty folk besides them.
وَلَقَدْ مَكَّنَاهُمْ فِيمَآ إِن مَّكَّنَّاكُمْ فِيهِ وَجَعَلْنَا لَهُمْ سَمْعاً وَأَبْصَاراً وَأَفْئِدَةً فَمَآ أَغْنَىٰ عَنْهُمْ سَمْعُهُمْ وَلاَ أَبْصَارُهُمْ وَلاَ أَفْئِدَتُهُمْ مِّن شَيْءٍ إِذْ كَانُواْ يَجْحَدُونَ بِآيَاتِ ٱللَّهِ وَحَاقَ بِهم مَّا كَانُواْ بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِئُونَ,And verily We had empowered them in ways in which We have not in is either for negation or extra empowered you O people of Mecca in the way of strength and means and We had vested them with ears and eyes and hearts. But their ears and their eyes and their hearts did not avail them in any way min shay’in min is extra since idh is operated by aghnā ‘avail’ and imbued with the sense of a particle introducing a reason they used to deny the signs of God His clear proofs and they were besieged by there befell them what they used to deride of chastisement.
وَلَقَدْ أَهْلَكْنَا مَا حَوْلَكُمْ مِّنَ ٱلْقُرَىٰ وَصَرَّفْنَا ٱلآيَاتِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ,And We certainly destroyed the towns that were around you that is We destroyed their inhabitants the likes of Thamūd ‘Ād and the people of Lot and We dispensed the signs We repeated the clear proofs so that perhaps they might return.
فَلَوْلاَ نَصَرَهُمُ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱتَّخَذُواْ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ قُرْبَاناً آلِهَةَ بَلْ ضَلُّواْ عَنْهُمْ وَذَلِكَ إِفْكُهُمْ وَمَا كَانُواْ يَفْتَرُونَ,So why did they not help them by averting from them the chastisement those whom they had chosen besides God that is to say other than Him as a means of nearness through whom they may secure nearness to God to be gods? alongside Him and these are the idols the first object of ittakhadhū ‘they had chosen’ is the omitted pronoun referred to by the relative clause alladhīna ‘those who …’ and it is hum ‘they’; qurbānan ‘nearness’ is the second object with ālihatan ‘gods’ as its substitution. Nay but they forsook them when the chastisement came down on them and that that is to say that choosing of theirs of idols as gods as a means of nearness to God was their lie and what they used to invent — the lies they used to speak mā ‘what’ either relates to the verbal action ‘their lying’ or it indicates a relative clause with the referential pronoun omitted this being fīhi ‘about’.
وَإِذْ صَرَفْنَآ إِلَيْكَ نَفَراً مِّنَ ٱلْجِنِّ يَسْتَمِعُونَ ٱلْقُرْآنَ فَلَمَّا حَضَرُوهُ قَالُوۤاْ أَنصِتُواْ فَلَمَّا قُضِيَ وَلَّوْاْ إِلَىٰ قَوْمِهِم مُّنذِرِينَ,And mention when We sent a company of jinn your way — the jinn of Nasībīn in Yemen or the jinn of Nineveh who were seven or nine and this was while the Prophet s was leading the dawn prayer with some of his Companions at Batn Nakhla as reported by the two Shaykhs al-Bukhārī and Muslim — to listen to the Qur’ān and when they were in its presence they said that is they said to one another ‘Listen carefully!’ concentrate in order to hear it carefully. Then when it was finished when he was finished reciting it they went back to their people to warn them to threaten their people with the chastisement from God if they do not believe — they had been Jews but then become Muslims.
قَالُواْ يٰقَوْمَنَآ إِنَّا سَمِعْنَا كِتَاباً أُنزِلَ مِن بَعْدِ مُوسَىٰ مُصَدِّقاً لِّمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ يَهْدِيۤ إِلَى ٱلْحَقِّ وَإِلَىٰ طَرِيقٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ,They said ‘O our people! Indeed we have heard a Book namely the Qur’ān which has been revealed after Moses confirming what was before it what preceded it such as the Torah. It guides to the truth submission to God islām and to a straight way that is the way thereto to Islam.
يٰقَوْمَنَآ أَجِيبُواْ دَاعِيَ ٱللَّهِ وَآمِنُواْ بِهِ يَغْفِرْ لَكُمْ مِّن ذُنُوبِكُمْ وَيُجِرْكُمْ مِّنْ عَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ,O our people! Respond to God’s summoner Muhammad (s) by embracing faith and believe in him and He God will forgive you some of your sins because some of these sins are wrongs done to others and which therefore can only be forgiven after those wronged are reconciled — and shelter you from a painful chastisement.
وَمَن لاَّ يُجِبْ دَاعِيَ ٱللَّهِ فَلَيْسَ بِمُعْجِزٍ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَلَيْسَ لَهُ مِن دُونِهِ أَوْلِيَآءُ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ فِي ضَلاَلٍ مُّبِينٍ,And whoever does not respond to God’s summoner cannot thwart God on earth that is to say he will not be able to thwart God by escaping from Him and eluding Him and he the one who does not respond will not have besides Him that is besides God any protectors any helpers to ward off the chastisement from him — those who do not respond are in manifest error’ plain and evident error.
أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْاْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ ٱلَّذِي خَلَقَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضَ وَلَمْ يَعْيَ بِخَلْقِهِنَّ بِقَادِرٍ عَلَىٰ أَن يُحْيِـيَ ٱلْمَوْتَىٰ بَلَىٰ إِنَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,Have they not seen have they not realised that is the deniers of resurrection that God Who created the heavens and the earth and Who was not wearied by their creation Who did not fail therein is able to give life to the dead? bi-qādirin is the predicate of anna ‘that’ the bi- having been added to it because the statement has the same force as the construction a-laysa’Llāhu bi-qādirin ‘Is God not able …?’. Yes indeed He is able to give life to the dead. Indeed He has is able to do all things.
وَيَوْمَ يُعْرَضُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ عَلَىٰ ٱلنَّارِ أَلَيْسَ هَـٰذَا بِٱلْحَقِّ قَالُواْ بَلَىٰ وَرَبِّنَا قَالَ فَذُوقُواْ ٱلْعَذَابَ بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَكْفُرُونَ,And on the day when those who disbelieve are exposed to the Fire when they are being chastised in it it will be said to them ‘Is not this chastisement the truth?’ They will say ‘Yes by our Lord!’ He will say ‘Then taste the chastisement for what you used to disbelieve in’.
فَٱصْبِرْ كَمَا صَبَرَ أُوْلُواْ ٱلْعَزْمِ مِنَ ٱلرُّسُلِ وَلاَ تَسْتَعْجِل لَّهُمْ كَأَنَّهُمْ يَوْمَ يَرَوْنَ مَا يُوعَدُونَ لَمْ يَلْبَثُوۤاْ إِلاَّ سَاعَةً مِّن نَّهَارٍ بَلاَغٌ فَهَلْ يُهْلَكُ إِلاَّ ٱلْقَوْمُ ٱلْفَاسِقُونَ,So endure with patience the harm done to you by your people just as the resolute those of constancy and power of endurance during hardships from among the messengers endured with patience before you so that you may be one of resolve like them min of mina’l-rusuli is explicative as all of them were men of resolve; but some say that this particle min is actually meant to be partitive since excluded from their number are Adam on the basis of God’s saying exalted be He And We did not find in him any constancy Q. 20115; and Jonah on the basis of His words And do not be like the One of the fish Q. 6848. And do not seek to hasten it for them for your people the sending down of the chastisement on them. Some say that he the Prophet seemed by this stage to have become exasperated because of them and desired that chastisement be sent down on them which is why he was enjoined to exercise patience and to refrain from hastening the chastisement for them — for it would befall them eventually without doubt. It shall seem for them on the day when they see what they are promised of chastisement in the Hereafter given its long duration as though they had tarried in this world by their reckoning only an hour of a day. This Qur’ān is a communication a proclamation from God to you. So shall any be destroyed that is to say none shall be destroyed upon seeing the chastisement but the immoral folk? that is to say the disbelieving folk.
ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَصَدُّواْ عَن سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ أَضَلَّ أَعْمَٰلَهُمْ,Those who disbelieve from among the people of Mecca and bar others from the way of God that is to say from faith He will leave their works to waste such as giving food to the poor or being kind to kin and so they will find no reward for these works of theirs in the Hereafter; but they are requited for them in this world purely out of His bounty exalted be He.
وَٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ وَآمَنُواْ بِمَا نُزِّلَ عَلَىٰ مُحَمَّدٍ وَهُوَ ٱلْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّهِمْ كَفَّرَ عَنْهُمْ سَيِّئَاتِهِمْ وَأَصْلَحَ بَالَهُمْ,But those who believe namely the Helpers al-Ansār and others like them and perform righteous deeds and believe in what has been revealed to Muhammad namely the Qur’ān — and it is the truth from their Lord — He will absolve them of He will forgive them their misdeeds and rightly dispose their mind their state so that they do not disobey Him.
ذَلِكَ بِأَنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ ٱتَّبَعُواْ ٱلْبَاطِلَ وَأَنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ ٱتَّبَعُواْ ٱلْحَقَّ مِن رَّبِّهِمْ كَذَلِكَ يَضْرِبُ ٱللَّهُ لِلنَّاسِ أَمْثَالَهُمْ,That rendering void of their works and the absolution of evil deeds is because those who disbelieve follow falsehood Satan and because those who believe follow the truth the Qur’ān from their Lord. Thus in the same manner of clarification does God strike for mankind similitudes of themselves that is how He clarifies for them their states in other words the disbeliever has his work rendered void while the believer is forgiven.
فَإِذَا لَقِيتُمُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ فَضَرْبَ ٱلرِّقَابِ حَتَّىٰ إِذَآ أَثْخَنتُمُوهُمْ فَشُدُّواْ ٱلْوَثَاقَ فَإِمَّا مَنًّا بَعْدُ وَإِمَّا فِدَآءً حَتَّىٰ تَضَعَ ٱلْحَرْبُ أَوْزَارَهَا ذَلِكَ وَلَوْ يَشَآءُ اللَّهُ لاَنْتَصَرَ مِنْهُمْ وَلَـٰكِن لِّيَبْلُوَاْ بَعْضَكُمْ بِبَعْضٍ وَٱلَّذِينَ قُتِلُواْ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ فَلَن يُضِلَّ أَعْمَالَهُمْ,So when you encounter in battle those who disbelieve then attack them with a striking of the necks fa-darba’l-riqābi is a verbal noun in place of the full verbal construction that is to say fa’dribū riqābahum ‘then strike their necks’ in other words slay them — reference is made to the ‘striking of the necks’ because the predominant cause of being slayed is to be struck in the neck. Then when you have made thoroughly decimated them bind spare them take them captive and bind firmly the bonds al-wathāq is what is used to bind yūthaqu a captive. Thereafter either set them free by grace mannan is a verbal noun in place of the full verbal construction that is to say either show them grace by setting them free unconditionally; or by ransom ransoming them with payment or with Muslim captives until the war that is to say its participants lay down its burdens its heavy loads of weaponry and other things so that either the disbelievers surrender or enter into a treaty. This last clause constitutes the ‘purpose’ of enjoining the Muslims to slaying and taking captive. So shall it be dhālika is the predicate of an implied subject such as al-amr ‘the ordinance’ in other words ‘the ordinance of God regarding them is as mentioned’. And had God willed He could have Himself taken vengeance on them without any fighting but He has commanded you to do it that He may test some of you by means of others from among them by way of battle so that the slain among you will end up in Paradise while those slain among them will end up in the Fire. And those who are slain qutilū a variant reading has qātalū ‘those who fight’ — this verse was revealed on the day of the battle of Uhud after the dead and the wounded had become numerous among the Muslims — in the way of God He will not let their works go to waste He will not render them void.
سَيَهْدِيهِمْ وَيُصْلِحُ بَالَهُمْ,He will guide them in this world and in the Hereafter to what benefits them and rightly dispose their minds their condition in both with that guidance and disposal in this world being for those who were not slain but who have been included in the statement ‘and those who were slain’ qutilū because of the predominance therein of those who were slain.
وَيُدْخِلُهُمُ ٱلْجَنَّةَ عَرَّفَهَا لَهُمْ,And He will admit them into Paradise which He has made known which He has pointed out to them so that they are guided to their dwellings in it and to their spouses and servants without asking to be shown the way.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُوۤاْ إِن تَنصُرُواْ ٱللَّهَ يَنصُرْكُمْ وَيُثَبِّتْ أَقْدَامَكُمْ,O you who believe! If you help God that is to say His religion and His Messenger He will help you against your enemy and make your foothold firm He will make you stand firm while you fight on the battleground.
وَٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ فَتَعْساً لَّهُمْ وَأَضَلَّ أَعْمَالَهُمْ,And as for those who disbelieve from among the people of Mecca wa’lladhīna kafarū is the subject the predicate of which is an implicit ta‘isū ‘they shall be wretched’ as indicated by what follows wretchedness shall be their lot that is destruction and defeat from God. And He will make their works go to waste wa-adalla a‘mālahum is a supplement to the implied ta‘isū ‘they shall be wretched’.
ذَلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ كَرِهُواْ مَآ أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ فَأَحْبَطَ أَعْمَٰلَهُمْ,That wretchedness and wasting of their works is because they are averse to what God has revealed of the Qur’ān with all that it includes of religious obligations takālīf so He has made their works fail.
أَفَلَمْ يَسِيرُواْ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ فَيَنظُرُواْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَاقِبَةُ ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ دَمَّرَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلِلْكَافِرِينَ أَمْثَالُهَا,Have they not travelled in the land to see the nature of the consequence for those who were before them? God destroyed them — He destroyed them their children and their possessions; and a fate the like thereof will be for the disbelievers that is to say the like of the fate of those before them.
ذَلِكَ بِأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ مَوْلَى ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَأَنَّ ٱلْكَافِرِينَ لاَ مَوْلَىٰ لَهُمْ,That granting of victory to the believers and the vanquishing of the disbelievers is because God is Patron Ally and Helper of those who believe and because the disbelievers have no patron.
إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُدْخِلُ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلأَنْهَارُ وَٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ يَتَمَتَّعُونَ وَيَأْكُلُونَ كَمَا تَأْكُلُ ٱلأَنْعَامُ وَٱلنَّارُ مَثْوًى لَّهُمْ,God will surely admit those who believe and perform righteous deeds into gardens underneath which rivers flow. As for those who disbelieve they take their enjoyment in this world and eat as the cattle eat that is to say they are only concerned with filling their bellies and satisfying their private parts without giving any thought to the Hereafter; and the Fire will be their habitation their home their station and their final destination.
وَكَأَيِّن مِّن قَرْيَةٍ هِيَ أَشَدُّ قُوَّةً مِّن قَرْيَتِكَ ٱلَّتِيۤ أَخْرَجَتْكَ أَهْلَكْنَاهُمْ فَلاَ نَاصِرَ لَهُمْ,And how many ka-ayyin means kam a town by which is meant the inhabitants thereof mightier in power than your town Mecca that is to say its inhabitants which expelled you akhrajatka is feminine despite the plural sense of inhabitants meant is because it takes into account the feminine form of qarya ‘town’ have We destroyed ahlaknāhum takes into account the former plural import of qarya ‘town’ and they had none to help them against Our destruction of them.
أَفَمَن كَانَ عَلَىٰ بَيِّنَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّهِ كَمَن زُيِّنَ لَهُ سُوۤءُ عَمَلِهِ وَٱتَّبَعُوۤاْ أَهْوَاءَهُمْ,Is he who follows a clear sign a definitive argument and proof from his Lord and these are the believers like those whose evil deeds have been adorned for them so that they see them as fair deeds and these are the disbelievers of Mecca and who follow their desires? by worshipping graven images. In other words there is no similarity between the two.
مَّثَلُ ٱلْجَنَّةِ ٱلَّتِي وُعِدَ ٱلْمُتَّقُونَ فِيهَآ أَنْهَارٌ مِّن مَّآءٍ غَيْرِ ءَاسِنٍ وَأَنْهَارٌ مِّن لَّبَنٍ لَّمْ يَتَغَيَّرْ طَعْمُهُ وَأَنْهَارٌ مِّنْ خَمْرٍ لَّذَّةٍ لِّلشَّارِبِينَ وَأَنْهَارٌ مِّنْ عَسَلٍ مُّصَفًّى وَلَهُمْ فِيهَا مِن كُلِّ ٱلثَّمَرَاتِ وَمَغْفِرَةٌ مِّن رَّبِّهِمْ كَمَنْ هُوَ خَالِدٌ فِي ٱلنَّارِ وَسُقُواْ مَآءً حَمِيماً فَقَطَّعَ أَمْعَآءَهُمْ,A similitude a description of the Garden promised to the God-fearing the Garden that is shared equally by all those who enter it this first clause is the subject of which the predicate follows therein are rivers of unstaling water read āsin or asin similar in form to dārib ‘striker’ and hadhir ‘cautious’ that is to say one that does not change in contrast to the water of this world which may change due to some factor; and rivers of milk unchanging in flavour in contrast to the milk of this world on account of its issuing from udders and rivers of wine delicious to the drinkers in contrast to the wine of this world which is distasteful to drink; and also rivers of purified honey in contrast to the honey of this world which when it issues out of the bellies of bees becomes mixed with wax and other elements; and there will be for them therein varieties of every fruit and forgiveness from their Lord for He is pleased with them in addition to His beneficence towards them in the way mentioned in contrast to one who is a master of servants in this world who while being kind to them may at the same time be wrathful with them. Is such a one like him who abides in the Fire? ka-man huwa khālidun fī’l-nāri the predicate of an implied subject which is a-man huwa fī hādha’l-na‘īm ‘Is one who is amidst such bliss as him who abides in the Fire?’. And they will be given to drink boiling water which rips apart their bowels that is their entrails so that these will be excreted from their rears. Am‘ā’ ‘bowels’ is the plural of mi‘an its alif being derived from the yā’ of their saying mi‘yān as an alternative singular to mi‘an.
وَمِنْهُمْ مَّن يَسْتَمِعُ إِلَيْكَ حَتَّىٰ إِذَا خَرَجُواْ مِنْ عِندِكَ قَالُواْ لِلَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ ٱلْعِلْمَ مَاذَا قَالَ آنِفاً أُوْلَـٰئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ طَبَعَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ قُلُوبِهِمْ وَٱتَّبَعُوۤاْ أَهْوَآءَهُمْ,And there are some among them namely the disbelievers who listen to you during the Friday sermon — and these are the hypocrites; until when they go forth from you they say to those who have been given knowledge that is to say to the knowledgeable ones among the Companions of the Prophet such as ‘Abd Allāh Ibn Mas‘ūd and ‘Abd Allāh Ibn ‘Abbās in derision and mockery ‘What was he saying just now?’ read ānifan or anifan meaning al-sā‘a ‘just now’. In other words they mean to say ‘we will not go back to listen to him again’. Those are the ones on whose hearts God has set a seal of disbelief and who follow their own desires in acting with hypocrisy.
وَٱلَّذِينَ ٱهْتَدَوْاْ زَادَهُمْ هُدًى وَآتَاهُمْ تَقْوَاهُمْ,But those who are rightly guided namely the believers He God enhances their guidance and invests them with fear of Him He inspires them to do that by which they can be wary of ending up in the Fire.
فَهَلْ يَنظُرُونَ إِلاَّ ٱلسَّاعَةَ أَن تَأْتِيَهُمْ بَغْتَةً فَقَدْ جَآءَ أَشْرَاطُهَا فَأَنَّىٰ لَهُمْ إِذَا جَآءَتْهُمْ ذِكْرَٰهُمْ,Do they then await they do not await namely the disbelievers of Mecca anything except that the Hour should come upon them an ta’tiyahum is an inclusive substitution for al-sā‘ata ‘the Hour’; in other words it cannot be other than that it will come upon them … suddenly? For already its portents the signs thereof have come among which are the sending of the Prophet s the splitting of the Moon Q. 541 and the Smoke Q. 4410. So when it the Hour has come upon them for what benefit will their reminder be? their remembering; in other words it will be of no benefit to them.
فَٱعْلَمْ أَنَّهُ لاَ إِلَـٰهَ إِلاَّ ٱللَّهُ وَٱسْتَغْفِرْ لِذَنبِكَ وَلِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَٱلْمُؤْمِنَاتِ وَٱللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ مُتَقَلَّبَكُمْ وَمَثْوَاكُمْ,Know then that there is no god except God that is to say adhere O Muhammad (s) to knowledge of this fact that will benefit you at the Resurrection and ask forgiveness for your sin — this was said to him despite his infallibility ‘isma so that his community might emulate him in this respect. Indeed he did do this. The Prophet s said ‘Verily I do ask God for forgiveness a hundred times every day’ — and for the believing men and believing women — herein is an honouring for them by having their Prophet enjoined to ask forgiveness for them. And God knows your going to and fro your bustle during the day in pursuit of your business and your place of rest when you retire to where you sleep at night. In other words He has knowledge of all your states nothing of which can be hidden from Him so be mindful of Him — the address in this verse is meant for believers as well as others.
وَيَقُولُ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ لَوْلاَ نُزِّلَتْ سُورَةٌ فَإِذَآ أُنزِلَتْ سُورَةٌ مُّحْكَمَةٌ وَذُكِرَ فِيهَا ٱلْقِتَالُ رَأَيْتَ ٱلَّذِينَ فِي قُلُوبِهِمْ مَّرَضٌ يَنظُرُونَ إِلَيْكَ نَظَرَ ٱلْمَغْشِيِّ عَلَيْهِ مِنَ ٱلْمَوْتِ فَأَوْلَىٰ لَهُمْ,And those who believe say seeking to take part in the struggle ‘Why has a sūra not been revealed?’ one in which there is mention of the command to participate in the struggle. But when a definitive sūra is revealed one in which nothing is abrogated naskh and fighting that is to say requirement for it is mentioned in it you see those in whose hearts is a sickness that is doubt — and they are the hypocrites — looking at you with the look of someone fainting at the point of death because of their fear of it and their aversion to it; in other words they fear fighting and are averse to it. Yet more fitting for them fa-awlā lahum is a subject the predicate of which is the following tā‘atun wa-qawlun ma‘rūfun
طَاعَةٌ وَقَوْلٌ مَّعْرُوفٌ فَإِذَا عَزَمَ ٱلأَمْرُ فَلَوْ صَدَقُواْ ٱللَّهَ لَكَانَ خَيْراً لَّهُمْ,would be to offer obedience and honourable words that is words that are kind to you. Then when the matter has been resolved upon that is to say when fighting has been prescribed if they are loyal to God in faith and obedience it will be better for them the sentence beginning with law ‘if’ constitutes the response to idhā ‘when’.
فَهَلْ عَسَيْتُمْ إِن تَوَلَّيْتُمْ أَن تُفْسِدُواْ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَتُقَطِّعُوۤاْ أَرْحَامَكُمْ,May it not be the case with you read ‘asītum or ‘asaytum; there is a shift here from the third person to the second person address that if you were to turn away if you were to shun faith you would then cause corruption in the land and sever your kinship ties? in other words that you would then return to the ways of pagandom such as belligerence and fighting.
أَوْلَـٰئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ لَعَنَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ فَأَصَمَّهُمْ وَأَعْمَىٰ أَبْصَارَهُمْ,Those that is the agents of corruption are the ones whom God has cursed so made them deaf to hearing the truth and blinded their eyes to the path of guidance.
أَفَلاَ يَتَدَبَّرُونَ ٱلْقُرْآنَ أَمْ عَلَىٰ قُلُوبٍ أَقْفَالُهَآ,Do they not contemplate the Qur’ān? and so recognise the truth. Or am here is like bal ‘nay but’ is it that there are locks on their hearts? so they are unable to comprehend it.
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱرْتَدُّواْ عَلَىٰ أَدْبَارِهِمْ مِّن بَعْدِ مَا تَبَيَّنَ لَهُمُ ٱلْهُدَى ٱلشَّيْطَانُ سَوَّلَ لَهُمْ وَأَمْلَىٰ لَهُمْ,Truly those who have turned by way of hypocrisy their backs after the guidance has become clear to them Satan has seduced he has adorned disbelief for them and has given them false hopes read wa-umliya lahum ‘false hopes have been given to them’ or wa-amlā lahum where the one who gives the false hopes is Satan but only by God’s will exalted be He for he Satan is the one who leads them astray.
ذَلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ قَالُواْ لِلَّذِينَ كَرِهُواْ مَا نَزَّلَ ٱللَّهُ سَنُطِيعُكُمْ فِي بَعْضِ ٱلأَمْرِ وَٱللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ إِسْرَارَهُمْ,That leading of them astray is because they said to those who were averse to what God revealed namely to the idolaters ‘We will obey you in some matters’ that is to say by cooperating to maintain enmity against the Prophet s and preventing people from participating in the struggle alongside him they had said as much secretly but God exalted be He exposed it; and God knows their secrets read asrārahum as the plural of sirr ‘a secret’ or isrārahum ‘their keeping of things secret’ as the verbal noun.
فَكَيْفَ إِذَا تَوَفَّتْهُمُ ٱلْمَلاَئِكَةُ يَضْرِبُونَ وُجُوهَهُمْ وَأَدْبَارَهُمْ,Then how will it be their predicament when the angels take them away beating yadribūna is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the angels their faces and their backs? with hooked iron rods.
ذَلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمُ ٱتَّبَعُواْ مَآ أَسْخَطَ ٱللَّهَ وَكَرِهُواْ رِضْوَٰنَهُ فَأَحْبَطَ أَعْمَٰلَهُمْ,That taking of them away in the state mentioned is because they followed what angers God and because they were averse to what pleases Him that is to say they were averse to doing what pleases Him. Therefore He has made their works fail.
أَمْ حَسِبَ ٱلَّذِينَ فِي قُلُوبِهِمْ مَّرَضٌ أَن لَّن يُخْرِجَ ٱللَّهُ أَضْغَانَهُمْ,Or did those in whose hearts is a sickness suppose that God would not expose their rancour? that He would not bring to light their spite against the Prophet s and the believers.
وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لأَرَيْنَاكَهُمْ فَلَعَرَفْتَهُم بِسِيمَاهُمْ وَلَتَعْرِفَنَّهُمْ فِي لَحْنِ ٱلْقَوْلِ وَٱللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ أَعْمَالَكُمْ,And if We will We could show them to you We could have pointed them out to you the lām is repeated in the following fa-la-‘araftahum then you would recognise them by their mark. And you will certainly recognise them wa-la-ta‘rifannahum the wāw is for an omitted oath and what follows it fī lahni’l-qawl is its response by their tone of speech that is to say by the meaning thereof when they speak in your presence alluding as they do to what amounts to a scathing attack upon the Muslims; and God knows your deeds.
وَلَنَبْلُوَنَّكُمْ حَتَّىٰ نَعْلَمَ ٱلْمُجَاهِدِينَ مِنكُمْ وَٱلصَّابِرِينَ وَنَبْلُوَاْ أَخْبَارَكُمْ,And We will assuredly try you We will assuredly test you by way of commanding you to participate in the struggle and in other ways until We know with knowledge outwardly manifested those of you who struggle for God’s cause and those who are steadfast in adhering to the struggle and in other ways and We will appraise We will reveal your record in terms of whether you acted with obedience or disobedience in what concerns the struggle all three verbs may be read with the third person singular yā’ or with the first person plural nūn.
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَصَدُّواْ عَن سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ وَشَآقُّواْ ٱلرَّسُولَ مِن بَعْدِ مَا تَبَيَّنَ لَهُمُ ٱلْهُدَىٰ لَن يَضُرُّواْ ٱللَّهَ شَيْئاً وَسَيُحْبِطُ أَعْمَالَهُمْ,Indeed those who disbelieve and bar from the way of God the path of truth and defy the Messenger opposing him after the guidance this is the meaning of ‘the way of God’ has become clear to them they will not hurt God in any way and He will make their works fail He will invalidate them good works such as voluntary alms and the like and so they will not find any reward for it in the Hereafter — this was revealed either regarding those Meccan participants at the battle of Badr who provided food for the needy or regarding the Jewish tribes of Qurayza and al-Nadīr.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُوۤاْ أَطِيعُواْ اللَّهَ وَأَطِيعُواْ ٱلرَّسُولَ وَلاَ تُبْطِلُوۤاْ أَعْمَالَكُمْ,O you who believe! Obey God and obey the Messenger and do not render your own works void by engaging in acts of disobedience for example.
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَصَدُّواْ عَن سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ ثُمَّ مَاتُواْ وَهُمْ كُفَّارٌ فَلَن يَغْفِرَ ٱللَّهُ لَهُمْ,Indeed those who disbelieve and bar from the way of God His path namely guidance and then die as disbelievers God will never forgive them — this was revealed regarding the men of the Well al-qalīb.
فَلاَ تَهِنُواْ وَتَدْعُوۤاْ إِلَى ٱلسَّلْمِ وَأَنتُمُ ٱلأَعْلَوْنَ وَٱللَّهُ مَعَكُمْ وَلَن يَتِرَكُمْ أَعْمَالَكُمْ,So do not falter do not be weak and do not call for peace read salm or silm that is to say a truce with the disbelievers should you encounter them when you have the upper hand al-a‘lawna the third letter of the triliteral root wāw has been omitted when you are the victors the vanquishers and God is with you helping and assisting and He will not stint you diminish you in the reward for your works that is to say of the reward for them.
إِنَّمَا ٱلْحَيَٰوةُ ٱلدُّنْيَا لَعِبٌ وَلَهْوٌ وَإِن تُؤْمِنُواْ وَتَتَّقُواْ يُؤْتِكُمْ أُجُورَكُمْ وَلاَ يَسْأَلْكُمْ أَمْوَٰلَكُمْ,The life of this world that is to say preoccupation solely with it is merely play and diversion; but if you believe and are wary of God both of which pertain to the goal of the Hereafter He will give you your rewards and will not ask you your wealth in return all of it rather only the alms that are required from it.
إِن يَسْأَلْكُمُوهَا فَيُحْفِكُمْ تَبْخَلُواْ وَيُخْرِجْ أَضْغَانَكُمْ,If He were to ask you for it and press you demand it persistently you would be niggardly and this niggardliness would expose your rancour towards the religion of Islam.
هَا أَنتُمْ هَـٰؤُلاَءِ تُدْعَوْنَ لِتُنفِقُواْ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ فَمِنكُم مَّن يَبْخَلُ وَمَن يَبْخَلْ فَإِنَّمَا يَبْخَلُ عَن نَّفْسِهِ وَٱللَّهُ ٱلْغَنِيُّ وَأَنتُمُ ٱلْفُقَرَآءُ وَإِن تَتَوَلَّوْاْ يَسْتَبْدِلْ قَوْماً غَيْرَكُمْ ثُمَّ لاَ يَكُونُوۤاْ أَمْثَالَكُم,Lo! there you are O those who are being called to expend in the way of God that which has been prescribed for you; yet among you there are those who are niggardly; and whoever is niggardly is niggardly only to his own soul one may say bakhila ‘alayhi or bakhila ‘anhu to mean ‘he was niggardly to someone’. For God is the Independent One without need of your expending; while you are the needy of Him. And if you turn away from obedience to Him He will replace you with another people that is to say He will bring them in your place and they will not be the likes of you in turning away from obedience to Him but they will be obedient to Him Mighty and Majestic is He.
إِنَّا فَتَحْنَا لَكَ فَتْحاً مُّبِيناً,Verily We have given you We have ordained for you the conquest fath of Mecca and other places in the future by force as a result of your struggle a clear victory one that is plain and manifest;
لِّيَغْفِرَ لَكَ ٱللَّهُ مَا تَقَدَّمَ مِن ذَنبِكَ وَمَا تَأَخَّرَ وَيُتِمَّ نِعْمَتَهُ عَلَيْكَ وَيَهْدِيَكَ صِرَاطاً مُّسْتَقِيماً,that God may forgive you by virtue of your struggle what is past of your sin and what is to come of it so that your community might then desire to struggle like you — this verse also constitutes a justification of the concept of the infallibility ‘isma of prophets peace be upon them against sin by way of a definitive rational proof the lām in li-yaghfira ‘that He may forgive’ is for indicating the ultimate reason for the conquest so that the content of this latter statement constitutes an effect and not the cause and that He may perfect by way of the mentioned victory His favour to you and guide you thereby to a straight path upon which He will confirm you — and this straight path is the religion of Islam;
وَيَنصُرَكَ ٱللَّهُ نَصْراً عَزِيزاً,and that God may grant you therein a mighty victory one of glory involving no humiliation.
هُوَ ٱلَّذِيۤ أَنزَلَ ٱلسَّكِينَةَ فِي قُلُوبِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ لِيَزْدَادُوۤاْ إِيمَٰناً مَّعَ إِيمَٰنِهِمْ وَلِلَّهِ جُنُودُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ عَلِيماً حَكِيماً,He it is Who sent down the spirit of Peace Divine reassurance into the hearts of the believers that they might add faith to their faith by way of their embracing of the legal stipulations of religion for every time He revealed one of these they would believe in it — including the command to struggle. And to God belong the hosts of the heavens and the earth and so if He wanted to bring victory to His religion by means of others He would have done so. And God is ever Knower of His creatures Wise in His actions in other words He is ever possessed of such attributes;
لِّيُدْخِلَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَٱلْمُؤْمِنَاتِ جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلأَنْهَارُ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا وَيُكَفِّرَ عَنْهُمْ سَيِّئَاتِهِمْ وَكَانَ ذَلِكَ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ فَوْزاً عَظِيماً,so that He may admit li-yudkhila is semantically connected to an omitted clause that is to say amara bi’l-jihād ‘He has enjoined the struggle so that He may admit’ the believing men and believing women into gardens underneath which rivers flow wherein they will abide and that He may absolve them of their misdeeds; for that in God’s sight is a supreme triumph;
وَيُعَذِّبَ ٱلْمُنَافِقِينَ وَٱلْمُنَافِقَاتِ وَٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ وَٱلْمُشْرِكَاتِ ٱلظَّآنِّينَ بِٱللَّهِ ظَنَّ ٱلسَّوْءِ عَلَيْهِمْ دَآئِرَةُ ٱلسَّوْءِ وَغَضِبَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَعَنَهُمْ وَأَعَدَّ لَهُمْ جَهَنَّمَ وَسَآءَتْ مَصِيراً,and so that He may chastise the hypocrites men and women and the idolaters men and women and those who make evil assumptions about God read al-saw’ or al-sū’ ‘evil’ in all three places; they assumed that He will not assist Muhammad (s) and the believers. For them will be an evil turn of fortune by way of abasement and chastisement; and God is wroth with them and He has cursed them He has banished them far from His mercy and has prepared for them Hell — and it is an evil destination! an evil place to return to.
وَلِلَّهِ جُنُودُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ عَزِيزاً حَكِيماً,And to God belong the hosts of the heavens and the earth; and God is ever Mighty in His kingdom Wise in His actions in other words He is ever possessed of such attributes.
إِنَّآ أَرْسَلْنَٰكَ شَٰهِداً وَمُبَشِّراً وَنَذِيراً,Indeed We have sent you as a witness against your community at the Resurrection and a bearer of good tidings to them in this world and a warner to threaten those in it who do evil with the punishment of the Fire;
لِّتُؤْمِنُواْ بِٱللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ وَتُعَزِّرُوهُ وَتُوَقِّرُوهُ وَتُسَبِّحُوهُ بُكْرَةً وَأَصِيلاً,that you may believe li-tu’minū may also here be read li-yu’minū ‘that they may believe’; and similarly read either the second person plural or the third person plural in the next three instances in God and His Messenger and that you may support Him tu‘azzirūhu a variant reading has tu‘azzizūhu and revere Him the third person suffixed pronoun -hu ‘him’ may refer either to God or to His Messenger and glorify Him that is God morning and evening.
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يُبَايِعُونَكَ إِنَّمَا يُبَايِعُونَ ٱللَّهَ يَدُ ٱللَّهِ فَوْقَ أَيْدِيهِمْ فَمَن نَّكَثَ فَإِنَّمَا يَنكُثُ عَلَىٰ نَفْسِهِ وَمَنْ أَوْفَىٰ بِمَا عَاهَدَ عَلَيْهُ ٱللَّهَ فَسَيُؤْتِيهِ أَجْراً عَظِيماً,Truly those who pledge allegiance to you the ‘Pledge of Beatitude’ bay‘at al-ridwān given at al-Hudaybiyya in fact pledge allegiance to God — this statement is akin to Whoever obeys the Messenger verily obeys God Q. 480. The Hand of God is above their hands the hands with which they pledged allegiance to the Prophet in other words God exalted be He has observed their pledge of allegiance and will requite them in accordance with their adherence to it. So whoever reneges whoever breaches the pledge reneges — that is the evil consequences of his breach will eventually be — against his own soul; and whoever fulfils the covenant which he has made with God He will give him fa-sa-yu’tīhi; or read fa-sa-nu’tīhi ‘We will give him’ a great reward.
سَيَقُولُ لَكَ ٱلْمُخَلَّفُونَ مِنَ ٱلأَعْرَابِ شَغَلَتْنَآ أَمْوَالُنَا وَأَهْلُونَا فَٱسْتَغْفِرْ لَنَا يَقُولُونَ بِأَلْسِنَتِهِمْ مَّا لَيْسَ فِي قُلُوبِهِمْ قُلْ فَمَن يَمْلِكُ لَكُمْ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ شَيْئاً إِنْ أَرَادَ بِكُمْ ضَرّاً أَوْ أَرَادَ بِكُمْ نَفْعاً بَلْ كَانَ ٱللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيراً,Those of the Bedouins who were left behind around Medina — that is to say those whom God made to stay behind and not to accompany you when you had asked them to set out with you for Mecca fearing that Quraysh would attack you upon your return in the year of al-Hudaybiyya — will say to you ‘Our possessions and our families kept us occupied preventing us from going forth with you. So ask forgiveness for us!’ of God for our failure to go forth with you. God exalted be He exposes their mendacity by saying They say with their tongues that is to say in asking forgiveness and in the preceding statement of theirs what is not in their hearts and so they are lying in the excuse which they give. Say ‘Who can an interrogative meant rhetorically as a negation that is to say ‘none can’ avail you anything against God should He desire to cause you harm read darran or durran or desire to bring you benefit? Nay but God is ever Aware of what you do in other words He is ever possessed of such an attribute.
بَلْ ظَنَنْتُمْ أَن لَّن يَنقَلِبَ ٱلرَّسُولُ وَٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ إِلَىٰ أَهْلِيهِمْ أَبَداً وَزُيِّنَ ذَلِكَ فِي قُلُوبِكُمْ وَظَنَنتُمْ ظَنَّ ٱلسَّوْءِ وَكُنتُمْ قَوْماً بُوراً,Nay bal in both instances marks a transition from one subject to another but you thought that the Messenger and the believers would never return to their families and that thought was adorned in your hearts that is to say you thought that they would be annihilated by being slain and would not return and you thought evil thoughts that just mentioned and other things and you were a ruined lot’ būr is the plural of bā’ir in other words a lot to be destroyed according to God for having entertained such evil thoughts.
وَمَن لَّمْ يُؤْمِن بِٱللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ فَإِنَّآ أَعْتَدْنَا لِلْكَافِرِينَ سَعِيراً,And whoever does not believe in God and His Messenger We have prepared for the disbelievers a blaze a severe fire.
وَلِلَّهِ مُلْكُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ يَغْفِرُ لِمَن يَشَآءُ وَيُعَذِّبُ مَن يَشَآءُ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ غَفُوراً رَّحِيماً,And to God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth He forgives whomever He will and chastises whomever He will; and God is ever Forgiving Merciful that is to say He is ever possessed of the attributes mentioned.
سَيَقُولُ ٱلْمُخَلَّفُونَ إِذَا ٱنطَلَقْتُمْ إِلَىٰ مَغَانِمَ لِتَأْخُذُوهَا ذَرُونَا نَتَّبِعْكُمْ يُرِيدُونَ أَن يُبَدِّلُواْ كَلاَمَ ٱللَّهِ قُل لَّن تَتَّبِعُونَا كَذَٰلِكُمْ قَالَ ٱللَّهُ مِن قَبْلُ فَسَيَقُولُونَ بَلْ تَحْسُدُونَنَا بَلْ كَانُواْ لاَ يَفْقَهُونَ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً,Those mentioned who were left behind will say when you set forth after spoils namely the spoils of Khaybar in order to capture them ‘Let us follow you’ that we might also take a share of it. They desire thereby to change the words of God kalāma’Llāhi a variant reading has kalima’Llāhi in other words His promising of the spoils of Khaybar exclusively for those who were at al-Hudaybiyya. Say ‘You shall never follow us! Thus has God said beforehand’ that is prior to our return. Then they will say ‘Nay but you are envious of us’ lest we might acquire a share of the spoils and therefore you say this that you say. Nay but they never understood anything of religion all except a few of them.
قُل لِّلْمُخَلَّفِينَ مِنَ ٱلأَعْرَابِ سَتُدْعَوْنَ إِلَىٰ قَوْمٍ أُوْلِي بَأْسٍ شَدِيدٍ تُقَاتِلُونَهُمْ أَوْ يُسْلِمُونَ فَإِن تُطِيعُواْ يُؤْتِكُمُ ٱللَّهُ أَجْراً حَسَناً وَإِن تَتَوَلَّوْاْ كَمَا تَوَلَّيْتُمْ مِّن قَبْلُ يُعَذِّبْكُمْ عَذَاباً أَلِيماً,Say to those of the Bedouins mentioned who were left behind to test them ‘You shall be called against a people possessed of great might — these are said to have been the tribe of Banū Hanīfa the inhabitants of the region of al-Yamāma; but it is also said that these were the Persians and the Byzantines — you shall fight them tuqātilūnahum is a circumstancial qualifier referring to an implied future situation which constitutes that to which the ‘call’ will be made; or they will submit so that you will not have to fight. So if you obey the command to fight them God will give you a good reward; but if you turn away like you turned away before He will chastise you with a painful chastisement’.
لَّيْسَ عَلَى ٱلأَعْمَىٰ حَرَجٌ وَلاَ عَلَى ٱلأَعْرَجِ حَرَجٌ وَلاَ عَلَى ٱلْمَرِيضِ حَرَجٌ وَمَن يُطِعِ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ يُدْخِلْهُ جَنَّٰتٍ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلأَنْهَٰرُ وَمَن يَتَوَلَّ يُعَذِّبْهُ عَذَاباً أَلِيماً,There is no blame on the blind nor is there blame on the lame nor is there blame on the sick to refrain from participating in the struggle. And whoever obeys God and His Messenger He will admit him read yudkhilhu or nudkhilhu ‘We will admit him’ into gardens underneath which rivers flow; and whoever turns away him He will chastise read yu‘adhdhibhu or nu‘adhdhibhu ‘him We will chastise’ with a painful chastisement.
لَّقَدْ رَضِيَ ٱللَّهُ عَنِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ إِذْ يُبَايِعُونَكَ تَحْتَ ٱلشَّجَرَةِ فَعَلِمَ مَا فِي قُلُوبِهِمْ فَأنزَلَ ٱلسَّكِينَةَ عَلَيْهِمْ وَأَثَابَهُمْ فَتْحاً قَرِيباً,Verily God was pleased with the believers when they pledged allegiance to you at al-Hudaybiyya under the tree this was an acacia — they these believers numbered 1300 or more; he took an oath of allegiance from them that they would fight against Quraysh and not attempt to flee from death. And He God knew what was in their hearts of sincerity and loyalty so He sent down the spirit of Peace upon them and rewarded them with a near victory which was the conquest of Khaybar following their departure from al-Hudaybiyya
وَمَغَانِمَ كَثِيرَةً يَأْخُذُونَهَا وَكَان ٱللَّهُ عَزِيزاً حَكِيماً,and abundant spoils which they will capture from Khaybar and God is ever Mighty Wise that is to say He is ever possessed of such attributes.
وَعَدَكُمُ ٱللَّهُ مَغَانِمَ كَثِيرَةً تَأْخُذُونَهَا فَعَجَّلَ لَكُمْ هَـٰذِهِ وَكَفَّ أَيْدِيَ ٱلنَّاسِ عَنْكُمْ وَلِتَكُونَ آيَةً لِّلْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَيَهْدِيَكُمْ صِرَاطاً مُّسْتَقِيماً,God has promised you abundant spoils which you will capture through the various conquests. So He has expedited this one the spoils of Khaybar for you and withheld men’s hands from you with regard to your families after you had set off on the campaign as the Jews had intended to plot against them; but God cast terror into their hearts; so that it the expedited one wa-li-takūna is a supplement to an implied verb that is to say li-tashkurūhu ‘that you may give thanks to Him’ may be a sign for the believers of their being assisted by God and that He may guide you on a straight path that is to say the way in which you should rely on Him and entrust any affair to Him exalted be He;
وَأُخْرَىٰ لَمْ تَقْدِرُواْ عَلَيْهَا قَدْ أَحَاطَ ٱللَّهُ بِهَا وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيراً,and others wa-ukhrā is an adjectival qualification of the implied subject maghānima ‘spoils’ which you were not able to capture — namely spoils from the Persians and the Byzantines; God has verily encompassed these already that is to say He knows that they will be yours. And God has power over all things that is to say He is ever possessed of such an attribute.
وَلَوْ قَـٰتَلَكُمُ ٱلَّذِينَ كفَرُواْ لَوَلَّوُاْ ٱلأَدْبَارَ ثُمَّ لاَ يَجِدُونَ وَلِيّاً وَلاَ نَصِيراً,And if those who disbelieve had fought you at al-Hudaybiyya they would have turned their backs to flee — then they would not have found any protector to guard them or helper.
سُنَّةَ ٱللَّهِ ٱلَّتِي قَدْ خَلَتْ مِن قَبْلُ وَلَن تَجِدَ لِسُنَّةِ ٱللَّهِ تَبْدِيلاً,That is the way of God sunnata’Llāhi is a verbal noun emphasising the import of the preceding sentence about the defeat of the disbelievers and the victory of the believers that is to say sanna’Llāhu dhālika sunnatan ‘God has established this as His way of dealing with believers and disbelievers’ which has taken its course before and you will never find in God’s way any change by Him.
وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِي كَفَّ أَيْدِيَهُمْ عَنكُمْ وَأَيْدِيَكُمْ عَنْهُم بِبَطْنِ مَكَّةَ مِن بَعْدِ أَنْ أَظْفَرَكُمْ عَلَيْهِمْ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيراً,And it is He Who withheld their hands from you and your hands from them in the valley of Mecca at al-Hudaybiyya after He had made you victors over them for eighty of them surrounded your camp in order to inflict losses upon you but they were captured and taken to the Prophet s who pardoned them and set them free and this resulted in the truce. And God is ever Seer of what you do read ta‘malūna or ya‘malūna ‘they do’ that is to say He is ever possessed of this attribute.
هُمُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَصَدُّوكُمْ عَنِ ٱلْمَسْجِدِ ٱلْحَرَامِ وَٱلْهَدْيَ مَعْكُوفاً أَن يَبْلُغَ مَحِلَّهُ وَلَوْلاَ رِجَالٌ مُّؤْمِنُونَ وَنِسَآءٌ مُّؤْمِنَاتٌ لَّمْ تَعْلَمُوهُمْ أَن تَطَئُوهُمْ فَتُصِيبَكُمْ مِّنْهُمْ مَّعَرَّةٌ بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ لِّيُدْخِلَ ٱللَّهُ فِي رَحْمَتِهِ مَن يَشَآءُ لَوْ تَزَيَّلُواْ لَعَذَّبْنَا ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِنْهُمْ عَذَاباً أَلِيماً,They are the ones who disbelieved and barred you from the Sacred Mosque that is barred you from reaching it and prevented the offering wa’l-hadya is a supplement to the suffixed pronoun –kum ‘you’ of saddūkum ‘they barred you’ which was detained ma‘kūfan is a circumstantial qualifier from reaching its destination that is from the place at which it is customarily sacrificed namely the Sanctuary itself an yablugha mahillahu is an inclusive substitution. And were it not for some of the believing men and believing women being present at Mecca alongside the disbelievers whom you did not know to be believers — lest you should trample them that is to say lest you should slay them together with the disbelievers had you been given permission to embark on the conquest an tata’ūhum is an inclusive substitution for –hum ‘them’ of lam ta‘lamūhum ‘whom you did not know’ and thus incur sin on account of them without your knowing it … the third person pronouns in both groups of people predominantly imply males; the response to lawlā ‘were it not’ has been omitted through ellipsis being something along the lines of la-udhina lakum fī’l-fathi ‘you would have been permitted to embark on the conquest’ but permission for this was not given at the time so that God may admit into His mercy whom He will such as those believers mentioned. Had they been clearly separated had they the believers been distinguishable from the disbelievers We would have surely chastised the disbelievers among them of the people of Mecca immediately thereat by permitting you to go ahead with the conquest thereof with a painful chastisement.
إِذْ جَعَلَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ فِي قُلُوبِهِمُ ٱلْحَمِيَّةَ حَمِيَّةَ ٱلْجَاهِلِيَّةِ فَأَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ سَكِينَتَهُ عَلَىٰ رَسُولِهِ وَعَلَى ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَأَلْزَمَهُمْ كَلِمَةَ ٱلتَّقْوَىٰ وَكَانُوۤاْ أَحَقَّ بِهَا وَأَهْلَهَا وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عَلِيماً,When those who disbelieve alladhīna kafarū is the subject of the following verb ja‘ala nourished idh ja‘ala is semantically connected to ‘adhdhabnā in their hearts zealotry al-hamiyya means ‘disdain of something’ the zealotry of pagandom hamiyyata’l-jāhiliyyati substitutes for al-hamiyyata ‘zealotry’ namely their barring of the Prophet and his Companions from visiting the Sacred Mosque but then God sent down His spirit of Peace upon His Messenger and the believers and so they the disbelievers made a truce with them on the condition that they the believers would be allowed to return the following year and such zealotry would not overcome them the believers as it did the disbelievers then until they would come to fight them later and He made them the believers abide by the word of God-fearing kalimata’l-taqwā ‘there is no god except God and Muhammad is His Messenger’ it kalima ‘word’ is annexed to al-taqwā because it is the cause of it for they were worthier of it of the word than the disbelievers and deserving of it wa-ahlahā is an explanatory supplement. And God is ever Knower of all things that is to say He is ever possessed of such an attribute and among the things He knows is that they are worthy of it.
لَّقَدْ صَدَقَ ٱللَّهُ رَسُولَهُ ٱلرُّءْيَا بِٱلْحَقِّ لَتَدْخُلُنَّ ٱلْمَسْجِدَ ٱلْحَرَامَ إِن شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ آمِنِينَ مُحَلِّقِينَ رُءُوسَكُمْ وَمُقَصِّرِينَ لاَ تَخَافُونَ فَعَلِمَ مَا لَمْ تَعْلَمُواْ فَجَعَلَ مِن دُونِ ذَلِكَ فَتْحاً قَرِيباً,Verily God has fulfilled the vision for His Messenger in all truth The Messenger of God s saw in his sleep in the year of al-Hudaybiyya before his departure from Medina that he would enter Mecca together with his Companions safely whereafter they would shave completely or shorten their hair. He informed his Companions of this and they rejoiced. But when they set off with him from Medina and the disbelievers impeded them at al-Hudaybiyya such that they had to retreat which was distressing for them for some of the hypocrites began to have doubts about the Prophet’s sincerity this verse was revealed bi’l-haqqi ‘in all truth’ is semantically connected to sadaqa ‘fulfilled’ or it is a circumstantial qualifier referring to al-ru’yā ‘the vision’ and what comes after it is the explanation thereof ‘You will assuredly enter the Sacred Mosque God willing — this is said to secure blessings — in safety to shave your heads that is all the hair or to shorten it to shorten some of the hair both muhalliqīna and muqassirīna are implied circumstantial qualifiers without any fear’ ever. So He knew there to be in the truce what you did not know in the way of reconciliation between the believers and the Meccans and assigned you before that entry a near victory namely the conquest of Khaybar — the vision was fulfilled in the following year.
هُوَ ٱلَّذِيۤ أَرْسَلَ رَسُولَهُ بِٱلْهُدَىٰ وَدِينِ ٱلْحَقِّ لِيُظْهِرَهُ عَلَى ٱلدِّينِ كُلِّهِ وَكَفَىٰ بِٱللَّهِ شَهِيداً,It is He Who has sent His Messenger with guidance and the religion of truth that He may make it that is the religion of truth prevail over all religion over all the other religions. And God suffices as witness to the fact that you have been sent with what has been mentioned as God exalted be He says
مُّحَمَّدٌ رَّسُولُ ٱللَّهِ وَٱلَّذِينَ مَعَهُ أَشِدَّآءُ عَلَى ٱلْكُفَّارِ رُحَمَآءُ بَيْنَهُمْ تَرَاهُمْ رُكَّعاً سُجَّداً يَبْتَغُونَ فَضْلاً مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَرِضْوَاناً سِيمَاهُمْ فِي وُجُوهِهِمْ مِّنْ أَثَرِ ٱلسُّجُودِ ذَلِكَ مَثَلُهُمْ فِي ٱلتَّوْرَاةِ وَمَثَلُهُمْ فِي ٱلإِنجِيلِ كَزَرْعٍ أَخْرَجَ شَطْأَهُ فَآزَرَهُ فَٱسْتَغْلَظَ فَٱسْتَوَىٰ عَلَىٰ سُوقِهِ يُعْجِبُ ٱلزُّرَّاعَ لِيَغِيظَ بِهِمُ ٱلْكُفَّارَ وَعَدَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ مِنْهُم مَّغْفِرَةً وَأَجْراً عَظِيماً,Muhammad the subject is the Messenger of God its predicate and those who are with him that is his Companions from among the believers wa’lladhīna ma‘ahu another subject the predicate of which is the following ashiddā’u are hard tough against the disbelievers showing them no mercy but merciful among themselves ruhamā’u is a second predicate of wa’lladhīna ma‘ahu ‘and those who are with him’ that is to say they show mutual sympathy and affection for one another much like a father and a son. You see you observe them bowing prostrating in worship both rukka‘an and sujjadan are circumstantial qualifiers. They seek yabtaghūna is the beginning of a new sentence bounty from God and beatitude. Their mark sīmāhum is a subject their distinguishing feature is on their faces fī wujūhihim is its predicate this is a light and a radiance by which in the Hereafter they will be recognised as having been those who used to prostrate in this world from the effect of prostration min athari’l-sujūdi is semantically connected to the same thing to which the predicate is semantically connected that is to say kā’inatan ‘this being from the effect of prostration’; syntactically it is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the subject of kā’inatan which is also the subject of the predicate sc. wujūhihim ‘their faces’. That mentioned description is their description mathaluhum is the subject in the Torah fī’l-tawrāti is the predicate thereof; and their description in the Gospel wa-mathaluhum fī’l-injīli is a subject the predicate of which is what follows is as a seed that sends forth its shoot read shat’ahu or shata’ahu and strengthens it read āzarahu or azarahu nourishing it and assisting it and it grows stout and rises firmly becoming strong and upright upon its stalk its roots sūq is the plural of sāq delighting the sowers that is to say those who planted it on account of its fairness. The Companions may God be pleased with them are being described in this way for at the outset they were weak and very few in number; but then their number grew and they acquired strength in the most wholesome way so that He may enrage the disbelievers by them li-yaghīza bihimu’l-kuffāra is semantically connected to an omitted clause which is suggested by what preceded that is to say ‘they are likened to this so that God may enrage the disbelievers’. God has promised those of them who believe and perform righteous deeds the Companions minhum ‘of them’ min ‘of’ is an indicator of the genus and not partitive for they are all possessed of the mentioned attributes forgiveness and a great reward — Paradise. Both of these rewards will also be given to those who will come after them as is stated in other verses.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ لاَ تُقَدِّمُواْ بَيْنَ يَدَيِ ٱللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ وَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ,O you who believe do not venture ahead of tuqaddimū derives from qaddama with the sense of the 5th form taqaddama that is to say do not come forward with any unwarranted saying or deed ahead of God and His Messenger the one communicating the Message from Him that is to say without their permission and fear God. Surely God is Hearer of your sayings Knower of your deeds this was revealed regarding the dispute between Abū Bakr and ‘Umar may God be pleased with them both in the presence of the Prophet s over the appointment of al-Aqra‘ b. Hābis or al-Qa‘qā‘ b. Ma‘bad as commander of his tribe.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ لاَ تَرْفَعُوۤاْ أَصْوَاتَكُمْ فَوْقَ صَوْتِ ٱلنَّبِيِّ وَلاَ تَجْهَرُواْ لَهُ بِٱلْقَوْلِ كَجَهْرِ بَعْضِكُمْ لِبَعْضٍ أَن تَحْبَطَ أَعْمَالُكُمْ وَأَنتُمْ لاَ تَشْعُرُونَ,The following was revealed regarding those who raised their voices in the presence of the Prophet s O you who believe do not raise your voices — when you want to speak — above the voice of the Prophet when he is speaking and do not shout words at him when you wish to confide in him as you shout to one another but speak lower than that out of reverence for him lest your works should be invalidated without your being aware that is to say for fear of this happening as a result of the raising of voices and the shouting mentioned.
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يَغُضُّونَ أَصْوَاتَهُمْ عِندَ رَسُولِ ٱللَّهِ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱمْتَحَنَ ٱللَّهُ قُلُوبَهُمْ لِلتَّقْوَىٰ لَهُم مَّغْفِرَةٌ وَأَجْرٌ عَظِيمٌ,The following was revealed regarding those who used to lower their voices in the presence of the Prophet s such as Abū Bakr ‘Umar and others may God be pleased with all of them Truly those who lower their voices in the presence of God’s Messenger — they are the ones whose hearts God has tested for God-fearing that is to say He has tested them so that this fear of God may manifest itself in them. For them will be forgiveness and a great reward Paradise.
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يُنَادُونَكَ مِن وَرَآءِ ٱلْحُجُرَاتِ أَكْثَرُهُمْ لاَ يَعْقِلُونَ,The following was revealed regarding a group of people who came to see the Prophet s during the midday resting period while he was in his house and called out to him Truly those who call you from behind the apartments the private chambers of his womenfolk hujurāt is the plural of hujra which is an area of ground on which stones are laid yuhjaru ‘alayhi to form a wall or the like and it happened that each one of them called out in that rough and crude Bedouin manner from behind one of the apartments as they did not know in which apartment he was most of them do not understand given the way in which they acted your exalted status and the reverence that befits it.
وَلَوْ أَنَّهُمْ صَبَرُواْ حَتَّىٰ تَخْرُجَ إِلَيْهِمْ لَكَانَ خَيْراً لَّهُمْ وَٱللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,And had they been patient annahum ‘they’ has independent status on account of inceptiveness; alternatively it is said to govern an implied verb such as thabata ‘had their patience been maintained’ until you came out to them it would have been better for them; and God is Forgiving Merciful to those of them who repent.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُوۤاْ إِن جَآءَكُمْ فَاسِقٌ بِنَبَإٍ فَتَبَيَّنُوۤاْ أَن تُصِيبُواْ قَوْمًا بِجَهَالَةٍ فَتُصْبِحُواْ عَلَىٰ مَا فَعَلْتُمْ نَادِمِينَ,The following was revealed regarding al-Walīd b. ‘Uqba whom the Prophet had sent to the Banū al-Mustaliq in order to ascertain their loyalty to Islam. He already feared them on account of an old feud between him and them from the time of pagandom before Islam and so upon seeing them come out to him he returned and claimed that they had refused to give the voluntary alms and intended to kill him. And just as the Prophet s was making plans to raid them they came to him to disavow what he al-Walīd had said about them O you who believe if a reprobate should come to you with some tiding some piece of information verify it ascertain his truthfulness from his mendacity fa-tabayyanū a variant reading has fa-tathabbatū from al-thabāt ‘to ascertain’ lest you injure a folk an tusībū qawman an object denoting reason that is to say for fear of this happening out of ignorance bi-jahālatin is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the subject of the verb that is to say while you are ignorant; and then become remorseful of what you have perpetrated erroneously against that folk. After they had returned to their homelands the Prophet s sent Khālid b. al-Walīd to them who observed only obedience and goodness in them and later informed the Prophet of this.
وَٱعْلَمُوۤاْ أَنَّ فِيكُمْ رَسُولَ ٱللَّهِ لَوْ يُطِيعُكُمْ فِي كَثِيرٍ مِّنَ ٱلأَمْرِ لَعَنِتُّمْ وَلَـٰكِنَّ ٱللَّهَ حَبَّبَ إِلَيْكُمُ ٱلإِيمَانَ وَزَيَّنَهُ فِي قُلُوبِكُمْ وَكَرَّهَ إِلَيْكُمُ ٱلْكُفْرَ وَٱلْفُسُوقَ وَٱلْعِصْيَانَ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلرَّاشِدُونَ,And know that the Messenger of God is among you so do not speak falsehood for God will inform him of the real state of affairs. If he were to obey you in many matters which you communicate contrary to reality so that the necessary evil consequences ensue you would surely be in trouble you would earn in addition to that sin the sin for the consequences that ensue from your error. But God has endeared faith to you adorning your hearts with it and He has made odious to you disbelief and immorality and disobedience an instance of suppletion with respect to import as opposed to lexical form; for the one to whom ‘faith has been endeared …’ and so forth will naturally be dissimilar in character to the mentioned reprobate. Those there is here a shift from the second to the third person address — they are the right-minded the ones firmly established upon the way of their religion;
فَضْلاً مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَنِعْمَةً وَٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ حَكِيمٌ,that is a favour from God fadlan is a verbal noun in the accusative because of the implied verbal action that is afdala ‘He gives a favour’ and a grace from Him and God is Knower of them Wise in His bestowal of graces on them.
وَإِن طَآئِفَتَانِ مِنَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ ٱقْتَتَلُواْ فَأَصْلِحُواْ بَيْنَهُمَا فَإِن بَغَتْ إِحْدَاهُمَا عَلَىٰ ٱلأُخْرَىٰ فَقَاتِلُواْ ٱلَّتِي تَبْغِي حَتَّىٰ تَفِيۤءَ إِلَىٰ أَمْرِ ٱللَّهِ فَإِن فَآءَتْ فَأَصْلِحُواْ بَيْنَهُمَا بِٱلْعَدْلِ وَأَقْسِطُوۤاْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُحِبُّ ٱلْمُقْسِطِينَ,And if two parties of believers in tā’ifatāni mina’l-mu’minīna... to the end of the verse was revealed regarding a particular incident where the Prophet s was riding a donkey and happened to pass by Ibn Ubayy; the donkey urinated and so Ibn Ubayy held his nose whereupon ‘Abd Allāh Ibn Rawāhā said ‘By God the smell of the donkey’s urine is sweeter-smelling than your musk. Fighting then ensued between the two clans with fists sandals and palm branches being thrown about fall to fighting iqtatalū the plural is used on account of the plural import for each party is made up of several individuals; a variant reading has the dual form iqtatalatā make peace between them baynahumā the dual here takes into account the actual dual form of tā’ifatān ‘two parties’. And if one of them aggresses against the other fight the one which aggresses until it returns to God’s ordinance to the truth. Then if it returns reconcile them fairly and act justly. Surely God loves the just.
إِنَّمَا ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ إِخْوَةٌ فَأَصْلِحُواْ بَيْنَ أَخَوَيْكُمْ وَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُرْحَمُونَ,The believers are indeed brothers in religion. Therefore always make peace between your brethren when they fall into dispute with one another a variant reading for the dual form akhawaykum ‘your two brethren’ has ikhwatakum ‘your brothers’ and fear God so that perhaps you might receive mercy.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ لاَ يَسْخَرْ قَوْمٌ مِّن قَوْمٍ عَسَىٰ أَن يَكُونُواْ خَيْراً مِّنْهُمْ وَلاَ نِسَآءٌ مِّن نِّسَآءٍ عَسَىٰ أَن يَكُنَّ خَيْراً مِّنْهُنَّ وَلاَ تَلْمِزُوۤاْ أَنفُسَكُمْ وَلاَ تَنَابَزُواْ بِٱلأَلْقَابِ بِئْسَ ٱلاسْمُ ٱلْفُسُوقُ بَعْدَ ٱلإَيمَانِ وَمَن لَّمْ يَتُبْ فَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلظَّالِمُونَ,O you who believe do not let any people that is any men among you deride yā ayyuhā’lladhīna āmanū lā yaskhar … to the end of the verse was revealed regarding the Banū Tamīm delegation when they derided the poor among the Muslims like ‘Ammār b. Yāsir and Suhayb al-Rūmī; al-sukhriya means ‘scorn’ and ‘disdain’ another people who may be better than they are in God’s sight; nor let any women from among you deride other women who may be better than they are. And do not defame one another do not cast aspersions on others and hence have aspersions cast on you that is let none among you denigrate another; nor insult one another by nicknames do not call another by a nickname which he detests such as ‘O degenerate one!’ or ‘O disbeliever!’. Evil is the name mentioned out of mockery derision and mutual reviling of immorality after faith! al-fusūqu ba‘da’l-īmāni substitutes for al-ismu ‘the name’ to indicate that it such naming of others is ‘immorality’ as it is an action which is usually repeated. And whoever does not repent of such immorality those — they are the evildoers.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ ٱجْتَنِبُواْ كَثِيراً مِّنَ ٱلظَّنِّ إِنَّ بَعْضَ ٱلظَّنِّ إِثْمٌ وَلاَ تَجَسَّسُواْ وَلاَ يَغْتَب بَّعْضُكُم بَعْضاً أَيُحِبُّ أَحَدُكُمْ أَن يَأْكُلَ لَحْمَ أَخِيهِ مَيْتاً فَكَرِهْتُمُوهُ وَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ تَوَّابٌ رَّحِيمٌ,O you who believe shun much suspicion. Indeed some suspicions are sins that is to say it causes one to fall into sin. This suspicion may have many forms such as thinking ill of the good folk from among the believers — and such good folk are many — in contrast to the immoral individuals among them in whose case there is no sin so long as it the suspicion is in accordance with their outward behaviour. And do not spy tajassasū one of the two tā’ letters of tatajassasū has been omitted do not pursue the imperfections and faults of Muslims by searching them out; nor backbite one another do not speak of him by mentioning something which he is averse to having mentioned of himself even if it be true. Would any of you love to eat the flesh of his brother dead? read maytan or mayyitan. That is to say it would not be right for him to do so. You would abhor it. Thus to backbite him in life would be like eating his flesh when he is dead. This latter form of behaviour has been suggested to you and you were averse to it so be averse to the former too. And fear God that is His punishment for backbiting by repenting of it; assuredly God is Relenting accepting of the penitence of those who repent Merciful to them.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّاسُ إِنَّا خَلَقْنَاكُم مِّن ذَكَرٍ وَأُنْثَىٰ وَجَعَلْنَاكُمْ شُعُوباً وَقَبَآئِلَ لِتَعَارَفُوۤاْ إِنَّ أَكْرَمَكُمْ عَندَ ٱللَّهِ أَتْقَاكُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلِيمٌ خَبِيرٌ,O mankind! We have indeed created you from a male and a female from Adam and Eve and made you nations shu‘ūb is the plural of sha‘b which is the broadest category of lineage and tribes qabā’il which are smaller than nations and are followed by ‘amā’ir ‘tribal districts’ then butūn ‘tribal sub-districts’ then afkhādh ‘sub-tribes’ and finally fasā’il ‘clans’; for example Khuzayma is the sha‘b while Kināna is the qabīla Quraysh is the ‘imāra Qusayy is the batn Hāshim is the fakhdh and ‘Abbās is the fasīla that you may come to know one another ta‘ārafū one of the two tā’ letters of tata‘ārafū has been omitted that you may acquire knowledge of the customs of one another and not to boast to one another of whose is the more noble lineage for pride lies only in the extent to which you have fear of God. Truly the noblest of you in the sight of God is the most God-fearing among you. Truly God is Knower of you Aware of your inner thoughts.
قَالَتِ ٱلأَعْرَابُ آمَنَّا قُل لَّمْ تُؤْمِنُواْ وَلَـٰكِن قُولُوۤاْ أَسْلَمْنَا وَلَمَّا يَدْخُلِ ٱلإِيمَانُ فِي قُلُوبِكُمْ وَإِن تُطِيعُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ لاَ يَلِتْكُمْ مِّنْ أَعْمَالِكُمْ شَيْئاً إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,The Bedouins — a group of men from among the Banū Asad — say ‘We believe’ we affirm the truth in our hearts. Say to them ‘You do not believe; but rather say “We have submitted” we are outwardly compliant; for faith has not yet entered into your hearts’ hitherto; however it is expected of you. Yet if you obey God and His Messenger by embracing faith and in other ways He will not diminish for you read ya’litkum or yalitkum by making the hamza an alif anything of your deeds that is of the reward for them. God is indeed Forgiving to believers Merciful to them.
إِنَّمَا ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ بِٱللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ ثُمَّ لَمْ يَرْتَابُواْ وَجَاهَدُواْ بِأَمْوَالِهِمْ وَأَنفُسِهِمْ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلصَّادِقُونَ,The true believers that is those who are true in their affirmation of faith — as He makes explicit in what follows — are only those who believe in God and His Messenger and then have not doubted they have not been uncertain of their faith and who strive with their wealth and their souls for the cause of God hence their striving manifests the sincerity of their faith. It is they who are sincere in their faith not those who say ‘We believe’ and from whom all that has been forthcoming is their submission to the religion.
قُلْ أَتُعَلِّمُونَ ٱللَّهَ بِدِينِكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ مَا فِي ٱلسَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَٱللَّهُ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عَلِيمٌ,Say to them ‘Do you pretend to inform God about your religion read the doubled 2nd verbal form a-tu‘allimūna ‘do you inform’ in other words are you intimating to Him your religious status when you say ‘We believe’ when God knows all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth and even though God is Knower of all things?’
يَمُنُّونَ عَلَيْكَ أَنْ أَسْلَمُواْ قُل لاَّ تَمُنُّواْ عَلَيَّ إِسْلاَمَكُمْ بَلِ ٱللَّهُ يَمُنُّ عَلَيْكُمْ أَنْ هَداكُمْ لِلإِيمَانِ إِن كُنْتُمْ صَادِقِينَ,They deem it to be a favour to you that they have submitted without the need for any fighting unlike those others who submitted only after being fought. Say ‘Do not deem your submission to be a favour to me islāmakum ‘your submission’ has dependent accusative status because of the omission of the genitive preposition bi-which is also read as implicit before the an in both instances. Rather it is God Who has done you a favour in that He has guided you to faith if you are being sincere when you say ‘We believe’.
إِنَّ اللَّهَ يَعْلَمُ غَيْبَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَٱللَّهُ بَصِيرٌ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ,Truly God knows the Unseen of the heavens and the earth that is He knows all that is hidden in both and God is Seer of what you do’ may be read either as ya‘malūna ‘they do’ or ta‘malūna ‘you do’ nothing of which can be concealed from Him.
قۤ وَٱلْقُرْآنِ ٱلْمَجِيدِ,Qāf God knows best what He means by this letter. By the glorious Qur’ān by the noble Qur’ān the disbelievers of Mecca have certainly not believed in Muhammad (s).
بَلْ عَجِبُوۤاْ أَن جَآءَهُمْ مُّنذِرٌ مِّنْهُمْ فَقَالَ ٱلْكَافِرُونَ هَـٰذَا شَيْءٌ عَجِيبٌ,Nay but they consider it odd that there should have come to them a warner from among themselves a messenger who is one of them to threaten them with the punishment of the Fire after resurrection. So the disbelievers say ‘This warning is an odd thing!
أَءِذَا مِتْنَا وَكُنَّا تُرَاباً ذَلِكَ رَجْعٌ بَعِيدٌ,What! read a-idhā pronouncing both hamzas or not pronouncing the second but inserting an alif between the two in both cases When we are dead and have become dust? shall we return to life? That is a far-fetched return!’ an event that is extremely remote.
قَدْ عَلِمْنَا مَا تَنقُصُ ٱلأَرْضُ مِنْهُمْ وَعِندَنَا كِتَابٌ حَفِيظٌ,We know what the earth diminishes consumes of them and with Us is a preserving Book namely the Preserved Tablet al-lawh al-mahfūz which contains everything that has been ordained by God.
بَلْ كَذَّبُواْ بِٱلْحَقِّ لَمَّا جَآءَهُمْ فَهُمْ فِيۤ أَمْرٍ مَّرِيجٍ,Nay but they denied the truth the Qur’ān when it came to them and so they with regard to the Prophet s and the Qur’ān are now in a confounded situation a troubled one. For on one occasion they said that he was ‘A sorcerer!’ cf. Q. 384 and that his statements were ‘Nothing but manifest sorcery!’ cf. Q. 3715 on another ‘A poet!’ cf. Q. 215 and ‘Poetry!’ cf. Q. 3669 and still on another ‘A soothsayer!’ cf. Q. 5229 and that his statements were nothing more than soothsaying cf. Q. 6942.
أَفَلَمْ يَنظُرُوۤاْ إِلَى ٱلسَّمَآءِ فَوْقَهُمْ كَيْفَ بَنَيْنَاهَا وَزَيَّنَّاهَا وَمَا لَهَا مِن فُرُوجٍ,Have they not then looked with their own eyes at the heaven being above them in order to take heed by their own minds of the consequences for them when they deny the Resurrection how We have built it without supports and adorned it with planets and how there are no cracks in it? no fissures blemishing it.

So like that manner of reviving shall be the rising from the graves so how can you deny it? the interrogative is meant as an affirmative; the meaning then is that they have indeed observed all of these things and are aware of what has been mentioned yet they disbelieve.

Safwān; but some say that he was some other person — and Thamūd the people of Sālih

So let them not ask Me to hasten on the chastisement should I give them respite until the Day of Resurrection.

فَمَنَّ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْنَا وَوَقَانَا عَذَابَ ٱلسَّمُومِ,but God showed us favour through His forgiveness and shielded us from the piercing chastisement al-samūm the Fire so called because it penetrates the pores al-masāmm; and they say also by way of intimation
إِنَّا كُنَّا مِن قَبْلُ نَدْعُوهُ إِنَّهُ هُوَ ٱلْبَرُّ ٱلرَّحِيمُ,indeed before that is in the world we used to call on Him worship Him affirming His Oneness. Verily He is read innahu as the beginning of a new independent sentence even if it introduces the reason in terms of its import; or read annahu as a reason in terms of the syntactical order of the words the Benign the Beneficent the True to His promise the Merciful One of tremendous mercy.

It makes no sense for a created thing to have no creator nor can a thing that will cease to existent have the power to create.

أَمْ لَهُمْ سُلَّمٌ يَسْتَمِعُونَ فِيهِ فَلْيَأْتِ مُسْتَمِعُهُم بِسُلْطَانٍ مُّبِينٍ,Or do they have a ladder a means of ascension into the heaven whereby they eavesdrop? that is at the top of which they listen in on the conversations of the angels so that they are then able to dispute with the Prophet as they claim. If that is what they assert Then let their eavesdropper let the one claiming to be able to listen in on their conversations on top of this ladder produce a manifest warrant a plain and evident proof.

وَإِن يَرَوْاْ كِسْفاً مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ سَاقِطاً يَقُولُواْ سَحَابٌ مَّرْكُومٌ,And if they were to see a fragment a portion of the heaven falling on them — as they say Then make fragments of the heaven fall upon us Q. 26187 as a chastisement for them — they would say this is ‘A heap of clouds!’ piled on top of one another that will bring us water; and so they do not believe.
فَذَرْهُمْ حَتَّىٰ يُلَـٰقُواْ يَوْمَهُمُ ٱلَّذِي فِيهِ يُصْعَقُونَ,So leave them until they encounter that day of theirs in which they will be thunderstruck in which they will die;

وَإِنَّ لِلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ عَذَاباً دُونَ ذَلِكَ وَلَـٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَهُمْ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ,And assuredly for those who do wrong by their persistence in disbelief there is a chastisement beyond that in this world before their death — thus they were punished with famine and drought for seven years and with being killed on the day of Badr; but most of them do not know that the chastisement will befall them.
وَٱصْبِرْ لِحُكْمِ رَبِّكَ فَإِنَّكَ بِأَعْيُنِنَا وَسَبِّحْ بِحَمْدِ رَبِّكَ حِينَ تَقُومُ,And submit patiently to the judgement of your Lord that they be reprieved and do not be grieved for surely you fare before Our eyes you are in Our sight We see you and preserve you.

وَهُوَ بِٱلأُفُقِ ٱلأَعْلَىٰ,when he was on the highest horizon the horizon of the sun that is to say at the place from which it rises in the form in which he Gabriel was created so that the Prophet s saw him; he the Prophet had been at Mount Hirā’ where Gabriel had obscured the entire horizon to the west. The Prophet fell down swooning after he had asked him Gabriel to show himself to him in the form in which he was created. Thus Gabriel had made a tryst with him at Hirā’ where he came down to him in human form.
ثُمَّ دَنَا فَتَدَلَّىٰ,Then he drew near he came close to him and drew closer still
فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَىٰ,until he was from him the Prophet within the length of two bows away or even nearer than that until he the Prophet had regained consciousness and his fright had subsided
فَأَوْحَىٰ إِلَىٰ عَبْدِهِ مَآ أَوْحَىٰ,whereat He God exalted be He revealed to His servant Gabriel what he Gabriel revealed to the Prophet s; the thing being revealed is not mentioned explicitly in exaltation of its great status.
مَا كَذَبَ ٱلْفُؤَادُ مَا رَأَىٰ,The heart the heart of the Prophet did not deny read khadhaba or kadhdhaba what he saw with his own eyes of the image of Gabriel.
أَفَتُمَارُونَهُ عَلَىٰ مَا يَرَىٰ,Will you then dispute with him will you then argue with him and hope to overwhelm him concerning what he saw? — an address to the idolaters who denied the Prophet’s s vision of Gabriel.
وَلَقَدْ رَآهُ نَزْلَةً أُخْرَىٰ,And verily he saw him in his true image another time
عِندَ سِدْرَةِ ٱلْمُنتَهَىٰ,by the Lote-tree of the Ultimate Boundary when he was carried on the night journey up through the heavens — this lote-tree is a nabk thorn-tree that lies to the right of the Throne ‘arsh the tree beyond which no angel or any other being pass;
عِندَهَا جَنَّةُ ٱلْمَأْوَىٰ,near which is the Garden of the Retreat to which the angels the spirits of martyrs and the pious retreat;
إِذْ يَغْشَىٰ ٱلسِّدْرَةَ مَا يَغْشَىٰ,when there shrouded the Lote-tree that which shrouded it of flying creatures and other beings idh ‘when’ is operated by ra’āhu ‘he saw him’
مَا زَاغَ ٱلْبَصَرُ وَمَا طَغَىٰ,The eye did not swerve on the part of the Prophet s nor did it go beyond the bounds that is to say his gaze did not turn away from the object of vision designated for it nor did it go beyond that object on that night.
لَقَدْ رَأَىٰ مِنْ آيَاتِ رَبِّهِ ٱلْكُبْرَىٰ,Verily he saw in it some of the greatest signs of his Lord some of the most awesome of these signs. He thus saw from among the marvels of the Realm malakūt a green drape rafraf that obscured the entire horizon of the heaven and Gabriel with his six hundred wings.
أَفَرَأَيْتُمُ ٱللاَّتَ وَٱلْعُزَّىٰ,Have you considered al-Lāt and al-‘Uzzā
وَمَنَاةَ ٱلثَّالِثَةَ ٱلأُخْرَىٰ,and Manāt the third of the preceding two the other? al-ukhrā a derogatory qualification of the third one. These were stone idols which the idolaters worshipped and which they claimed interceded for them with God the first direct object of a-fa-ra’aytum ‘have you seen’ is al-Lāt and what has been supplemented thereto; the second direct object has been omitted. The meaning then is ‘Inform Me do these idols have the power over anything such that you worship them besides God Who has the power over all that has been mentioned?’ And because of their assertion also that the angels were God’s daughters despite their aversion to daughters the following was revealed
أَلَكُمُ ٱلذَّكَرُ وَلَهُ ٱلأُنْثَىٰ,Are you to have males and He females?
تِلْكَ إِذاً قِسْمَةٌ ضِيزَىٰ,That then would indeed be an unfair division! dīzān ‘unfair’ derives from dāzahu yadīzuhu to mean ‘he wronged him’ ‘he was unjust to him’.
إِنْ هِيَ إِلاَّ أَسْمَآءٌ سَمَّيْتُمُوهَآ أَنتُمْ وَآبَآؤُكُم مَّآ أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ بِهَا مِن سُلْطَانٍ إِن يَتَّبِعُونَ إِلاَّ ٱلظَّنَّ وَمَا تَهْوَى ٱلأَنفُسُ وَلَقَدْ جَآءَهُم مِّن رَّبِّهِمُ ٱلْهُدَىٰ,These that is the mentioned deities are nothing but names which you have named by which you have named you and your fathers idols that you worship. God has not revealed any warrant any proof or evidence for them that is to say for the worship of them. They follow nothing but conjecture in their worship of them and that which ignoble souls desire of that which Satan adorned for them that they may intercede for them before God exalted be He even though guidance has already come to them from their Lord by the tongue of the Prophet s with definitive proof; yet they do not desist from their ways.
أَمْ لِلإِنسَانِ مَا تَمَنَّىٰ,Or shall man that is shall every human being among them have whatever he wishes for? such as their wish that the idols intercede for them. No! It is not so.
فَلِلَّهِ ٱلآخِرَةُ وٱلأُولَىٰ,Yet to God belong the Hereafter and the former life that is to say the life of the world and so nothing comes to pass in them except what He exalted wills.
وَكَمْ مِّن مَّلَكٍ فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ لاَ تُغْنِي شَفَاعَتُهُمْ شَيْئاً إِلاَّ مِن بَعْدِ أَن يَأْذَنَ ٱللَّهُ لِمَن يَشَآءُ وَيَرْضَىٰ,And how many an angel that is to say many an angel there is in the heavens and how honoured they are in God’s sight but whose intercession cannot avail in any way except after God gives permission to them for this intercession for whomever He wills of His servants and with whom He is satisfied because of His saying and they do not intercede except for him with whom He is satisfied Q. 2128. It is also well-known that it intercession cannot be forthcoming from them except after permission for it has been granted who is there that shall intercede with Him save with His leave Q. 2255.
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱلآخِرَةِ لَيُسَمُّونَ ٱلْمَلاَئِكَةَ تَسْمِيَةَ ٱلأُنْثَىٰ,Truly those who do not believe in the Hereafter give the angels the names of females for they say ‘They are God’s daughters’.
وَمَا لَهُم بِهِ مِنْ عِلْمٍ إِن يَتَّبِعُونَ إِلاَّ ٱلظَّنَّ وَإِنَّ ٱلظَّنَّ لاَ يُغْنِي مِنَ ٱلْحَقِّ شَيْئاً,But they do not have any knowledge thereof of this claim. They follow in this respect nothing but conjecture which they have conjured up and indeed conjecture can never substitute for the truth that is to say when it comes to acquiring knowledge of that which one is required to have knowledge of.
فَأَعْرِضْ عَن مَّن تَوَلَّىٰ عَن ذِكْرِنَا وَلَمْ يُرِدْ إِلاَّ ٱلْحَيَاةَ ٱلدُّنْيَا,So shun him who turns away from Our Remembrance that is from the Qur’ān and desires nothing but the life of this world — this was revealed before the command to struggle against the disbelievers.
ذَلِكَ مَبْلَغُهُمْ مِّنَ ٱلْعِلْمِ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ هُوَ أَعْلَمُ بِمَن ضَلَّ عَن سَبِيلِهِ وَهُوَ أَعْلَمُ بِمَنِ ٱهْتَدَىٰ,That namely the desire of this world is the full extent of their knowledge that is the limit of their knowledge namely that they have preferred this life to that of the Hereafter. Truly your Lord knows best those who have strayed from His way and He knows best those who are rightly guided He has knowledge of both and will requite both.
وَلِلَّهِ مَا فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِي ٱلأَرْضِ لِيَجْزِيَ ٱلَّذِينَ أَسَاءُواْ بِمَا عَمِلُواْ وَيَجْزِيَ ٱلَّذِينَ أَحْسَنُواْ بِٱلْحُسْنَى,And to God belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth that is He owns all of that among which also are the misguided one and the rightly guided one leading astray whomever He will and guiding whomever He will that He may requite those who do evil for what they have done by way of idolatry and otherwise and reward those who are virtuous by their affirmation of God’s Oneness and other acts of obedience with the best reward namely Paradise. He points out ‘the virtuous’ as being
ٱلَّذِينَ يَجْتَنِبُونَ كَبَائِرَ ٱلإِثْمِ وَٱلْفَوَاحِشَ إِلاَّ ٱللَّمَمَ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ وَاسِعُ ٱلْمَغْفِرَةِ هُوَ أَعْلَمُ بِكُمْ إِذْ أَنشَأَكُمْ مِّنَ ٱلأَرْضِ وَإِذْ أَنتُمْ أَجِنَّةٌ فِي بُطُونِ أُمَّهَاتِكُمْ فَلاَ تُزَكُّوۤاْ أَنفُسَكُمْ هُوَ أَعْلَمُ بِمَنِ ٱتَّقَىٰ,Those who avoid grave sins and abominations excepting lesser offences that is minor sins such as a look a kiss or a touch this constitutes a discontinuous exception in other words the meaning is but lesser offences are forgiven by the avoidance of grave sins. Truly your Lord is of vast forgiveness for such lesser sins and for accepting repentance. The following was revealed regarding those who used to say ‘What of our prayers our fasting and our pilgrimage!’. He knows you best from the time when He produced you from the earth that is to say when He created your father Adam from dust and when you were hidden fetuses ajinna is the plural of janīn in the bellies of your mothers. So do not claim purity for yourselves do not praise yourselves that is in admiration; but if it is done in recognition of God’s grace then that is fine. He knows best those who are God-fearing.
أَفَرَأَيْتَ ٱلَّذِي تَوَلَّىٰ,Did you see him who turned away from faith — that is the one who recanted when he was derided for it. He said ‘But I fear the punishment of God!’. But when the one deriding him guaranteed him that he would bear God’s chastisement for him provided that he reverted to his former idolatry and he then gave him a stated sum money he reverted —
وَأَعْطَىٰ قَلِيلاً وَأَكْدَىٰ,and gave a little of the stated sum of money and was then grudging? refrained from giving the remainder akdā derives from al-kudya earth that is hard as rock and which prevents the well-digger from digging through when he hits it.
أَعِندَهُ عِلْمُ ٱلْغَيْبِ فَهُوَ يَرَىٰ,Does he possess knowledge of the Unseen so that he sees? and therefore from among such knowledge he is able to know that another person may bear the chastisement of the Hereafter for him? No! This was al-Walīd b. al-Mughīra or someone else the sentence beginning with a-‘indahu ‘does he possess’ is the second object of the a-ra’ayta ‘have you seen’ which has the significance of ‘inform Me!’.
أَمْ لَمْ يُنَبَّأْ بِمَا فِي صُحُفِ مُوسَىٰ,Or am means bal has he not been informed of what is in the scrolls of Moses the books of the Torah or scrolls before it
وَإِبْرَاهِيمَ ٱلَّذِي وَفَّىٰ,and the scrolls of Abraham who fulfilled his summons he who completed what he had been charged with as in And when his Lord tested Abraham with certain words and he fulfilled them Q. 2124 the explication of mā ‘what’ is the following
أَلاَّ تَزِرُ وَازِرَةٌ وِزْرَ أُخْرَىٰ,that no burdened soul shall bear the burden of another an ‘that’ has been softened in place of the hardened form in other words no soul shall bear responsibility for the sins of another;
وَأَن لَّيْسَ لِلإِنسَانِ إِلاَّ مَا سَعَىٰ,and that wa-an to be understood as wa-annahu man shall have only what he himself strives for of good deeds and so he shall not have anything of the reward for good deeds striven for by another;
وَأَنَّ سَعْيَهُ سَوْفَ يُرَىٰ,and that his endeavour will be seen it will be inspected in the Hereafter
ثُمَّ يُجْزَاهُ ٱلْجَزَآءَ ٱلأَوْفَىٰ,then he will be rewarded for it with the fullest reward the most perfect reward one may say jazaytuhu sa‘yahu or jazaytuhu bi-sa‘yihi to mean the same thing
وَأَنَّ إِلَىٰ رَبِّكَ ٱلْمُنتَهَىٰ,and that read wa-anna as a supplement; it is also read wa-inna as the beginning of a new sentence; and the same applies to what comes after it in which case according to this second reading these inna statements no longer form part of the content of all that is ‘in the scrolls’ the ultimate end the return and the destination after death is toward your Lord whereat He will requite them;
وَأَنَّهُ هُوَ أَضْحَكَ وَأَبْكَىٰ,and that it is He Who makes to laugh whomever He will He makes joyous and makes to weep whomever He will He makes him sorrowful
وَأَنَّهُ هُوَ أَمَاتَ وَأَحْيَا,and that it is He Who brings death in this world and gives life for resurrection
وَأَنَّهُ خَلَقَ ٱلزَّوْجَيْنِ ٱلذَّكَرَ وَٱلأُنثَىٰ,and that He Himself creates the two spouses the two kinds the male and the female
مِن نُّطْفَةٍ إِذَا تُمْنَىٰ,from a drop of semen once it is emitted once it is poured forth into the womb
وَأَنَّ عَلَيْهِ ٱلنَّشْأَةَ ٱلأُخْرَىٰ,and that with Him rests the second genesis read al-nashā’ata or al-nash’ata the other creation for the Resurrection after the first creation
وَأَنَّهُ هُوَ أَغْنَىٰ وَأَقْنَىٰ,and that it is He Who enriches people by granting them sufficient wealth and grants possessions He Who gives that wealth that is enjoyed as property
وَأَنَّهُ هُوَ رَبُّ ٱلشِّعْرَىٰ,and that it is He Who is the Lord of Sirius — this is a star lying beyond the constellation of Gemini which was worshipped in the time of pagandom jāhiliyya;
وَأَنَّهُ أَهْلَكَ عَاداً ٱلأُولَىٰ,and that He destroyed former ‘Ād ‘Ādan al-ūlā a variant reading elides the nunation with the following lām sc. ‘Āda’l-ūlā; this former one refers to the people of ‘Ād while the second ‘Ād is that of the people of Sālih
وَثَمُودَ فَمَآ أَبْقَىٰ,and Thamūd wa-Thamūda may be declined as the name of their forefather or left as a diptote being the name of the tribe; it is a supplement to ‘Ādan sparing not a single one of them;
وَقَوْمَ نُوحٍ مِّن قَبْلُ إِنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ هُمْ أَظْلَمَ وَأَطْغَىٰ,and the people of Noah before that that is to say before ‘Ād and Thamūd We also destroyed them; indeed they were more unjust and more insolent than ‘Ād and Thamūd because of the long time that Noah remained among them and he remained among them a thousand-less-fifty years Q. 2914 for they despite their disbelief in him would still harm him and assault him;
وَٱلْمُؤْتَفِكَةَ أَهْوَىٰ,and the Deviant cities namely the cities of the people of Lot He overturned He hurled them down to the earth after lifting them up to the heaven upside down by commanding Gabriel to do this;
فَغَشَّاهَا مَا غَشَّىٰ,so that there covered them of rocks afterwards that which covered them this is purposely left vague in order to inspire terror; in sūrat Hūd it is stated We made their uppermost the nethermost and We rained upon them stones of baked clay Q. 1182.
فَبِأَيِّ آلاۤءِ رَبِّكَ تَتَمَارَىٰ,Then which of the bounties of your Lord which of His graces graces which indicate His Oneness and power do you dispute? do you have doubt about O man or deny?
هَـٰذَا نَذِيرٌ مِّنَ ٱلنُّذُرِ ٱلأُوْلَىٰ,This Muhammad (s) is a warner in the tradition of the warners of old of their kind that is to say he is a messenger like messengers before him sent to you just as they were sent to their peoples.
أَزِفَتِ ٱلآزِفَةُ,The Impending Hour is imminent the Resurrection is near at hand.
لَيْسَ لَهَا مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ كَاشِفَةٌ,None no soul besides God can disclose it that is to say only He can disclose it and manifest it as where He says He alone shall reveal it at its proper time Q. 7187.
أَفَمِنْ هَـٰذَا ٱلْحَدِيثِ تَعْجَبُونَ,Do you then marvel in denial at this discourse the Qur’ān
وَتَضْحَكُونَ وَلاَ تَبْكُونَ,and laugh mockingly and not weep when you hear its Promise and Threat

فَٱسْجُدُواْ لِلَّهِ وَٱعْبُدُواْ,So prostrate to God Who created you and worship Him! and do not prostrate to idols nor worship them.
ٱقْتَرَبَتِ ٱلسَّاعَةُ وَٱنشَقَّ ٱلْقَمَرُ,The Hour has drawn near the Resurrection is close at hand and the moon has split it broke in two at Mount Abū Qubays and Qu‘ayqa‘ān as a sign for the Prophet s for it had been demanded of him and when it took place he said ‘Bear witness now!’ — as reported by the two Shaykhs al-Bukhārī and Muslim.
وَإِن يَرَوْاْ آيَةً يُعْرِضُواْ وَيَقُولُواْ سِحْرٌ مُّسْتَمِرٌّ,And if they the disbelievers among Quraysh see a sign a miracle of the Prophet s they turn away and say this is ‘A powerful sorcery!’ mustamirr ‘powerful’ derives from al-mirra meaning ‘strength’; or it mustamirr means ‘incessant’.
وَكَذَّبُواْ وَٱتَّبَعُوۤاْ أَهْوَآءَهُمْ وَكُلُّ أَمْرٍ مُّسْتَقِرٌّ,And they denied the Prophet s and followed their own desires as regards their falsehood; and every matter that is good or evil will be settled with that person who is responsible for it either by his ending up in Paradise or in the Fire.
وَلَقَدْ جَآءَهُم مِّنَ ٱلأَنبَآءِ مَا فِيهِ مُزْدَجَرٌ,And verily there has come to them such tidings stories about the destruction of communities which denied their messengers as contain a deterrent to them muzdajar is a verbal noun or a noun of place; the dāl of muzdajar replaces the tā’ of the 8th form ifta‘ala; one may say izdajartuhu or zajartuhu to mean ‘I forbade him sternly’; mā ‘such as’ either indicates a relative clause or it is qualified by an adjective;
حِكْمَةٌ بَالِغَةٌ فَمَا تُغْنِ ٱلنُّذُرُ,wisdom hikmatun is the predicate of an omitted subject or a substitution for mā ‘such as’ or for muzdajar ‘deterrent’ that is far-reaching complete; but warnings nudhur is the plural of nadhīr functioning in the agent sense of mundhir ‘a warner’ that is to say ‘those matters which warn them’; mā is either for negation or it is an interrogative of denial in which case it stands as a preceding direct object are of no avail warnings are of no use with them.
فَتَوَلَّ عَنْهُمْ يَوْمَ يَدْعُ ٱلدَّاعِ إِلَىٰ شَيْءٍ نُّكُرٍ,So turn away from them! this is the import of the preceding statement and it completes what is being said. On the day when the Summoner namely Isrāfīl yawma ‘the day’ is rendered accusative by yakhrujūna ‘they will emerge’ next verse summons to an awful thing read nukur or nukr in the sense of munkar ‘disagreeable’ a thing which the souls will find awful and this is the Reckoning;
خُشَّعاً أَبْصَٰرُهُمْ يَخْرُجُونَ مِنَ ٱلأَجْدَاثِ كَأَنَّهُمْ جَرَادٌ مُّنتَشِرٌ,with their downcast khāshi‘an a variant reading has khushsha‘an humiliated looks absāruhum is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the subject of the verb yakhrujūna ‘they will emerge’ they that is mankind will emerge from the graves as though they were scattered locusts not knowing where to go out of fear and perplexity this sentence ka’annahum jarādun muntashirun is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the subject of the verb yakhrujūna ‘they will emerge’ and so is His saying muhti‘īna
مُّهْطِعِينَ إِلَى ٱلدَّاعِ يَقُولُ ٱلْكَافِرُونَ هَـٰذَا يَوْمٌ عَسِرٌ,scrambling hastening with their necks stretched out toward the Summoner. The disbelievers among them will say ‘This is a hard day!’ a difficult one for disbelievers — as is stated in sūrat al-Muddaththir a day of hardship for the disbelievers Q. 749-10.
كَذَّبَتْ قَبْلَهُمْ قَوْمُ نُوحٍ فَكَذَّبُواْ عَبْدَنَا وَقَالُواْ مَجْنُونٌ وَٱزْدُجِرَ,The people of Noah denied kadhdhabat has feminine inflection on account of the import referring to a feminine noun qawm ‘tribe’ before them before Quraysh. Thus they denied Our servant Noah and said ‘A madman!’ and he was reviled they repulsed him with insults and in other ways.
فَدَعَا رَبَّهُ أَنِّي مَغْلُوبٌ فَٱنتَصِرْ,And so he invoked his Lord saying ‘I have been annī to be understood as bi-annī overcome so help me!’
فَفَتَحْنَآ أَبْوَابَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ بِمَاءٍ مُّنْهَمِرٍ,Then We opened read fa-fatahnā or fa-fattahnā the gates of the heaven with torrential waters waters pouring down intensely
وَفَجَّرْنَا ٱلأَرْضَ عُيُوناً فَالْتَقَى ٱلمَآءُ عَلَىٰ أَمْرٍ قَدْ قُدِرَ,and We made the earth burst forth with springs that flowed forth and the waters the waters of the heaven and the earth met for a purpose a circumstance that was preordained a matter which had been decreed since pre-eternity namely their destruction by drowning.
وَحَمَلْنَاهُ عَلَىٰ ذَاتِ أَلْوَاحٍ وَدُسُرٍ,And We bore him that is Noah on one a ship made of planks and nails dusur is what boards are fastened down with of nails and the like; the singular is disār similar in pattern to kutub kitāb ‘book’
تَجْرِي بِأَعْيُنِنَا جَزَآءً لِّمَن كَانَ كُفِرَ,sailing before Our eyes that is in Our sights in other words it was being protected as retaliation jazā’an is in the accusative because of the implied verbal clause that is to say ‘they were drowned by way of revenge’ for the sake of him who was rejected namely Noah peace be upon him a variant reading for passive kufira has kafara ‘him who disbelieved’ in other words they were drowned as a punishment for them.
وَلَقَدْ تَّرَكْنَاهَا آيَةً فَهَلْ مِن مُّدَّكِرٍ,And verily We left it We preserved this deed as a sign for whomever might be admonished by it in other words the news of this deed became widely-known and endured. So is there anyone who will remember? anyone who will take heed from or be admonished by it? muddakir is actually mudhtakir but the tā’ has been replaced with a dāl likewise the dhāl and it the dāl has been assimilated with it the other dāl.
فَكَيْفَ كَانَ عَذَابِي وَنُذُرِ,How dreadful then were My chastisement and My warnings? this is an interrogative meant as an affirmative; kayfa ‘how’ is the predicate of kāna ‘was’ and it is here being used to inquire about a ‘state’; the intention is to prompt those who are being addressed to affirm the fact that God’s chastisement of those who denied Noah was fully deserved.
وَلَقَدْ يَسَّرْنَا ٱلْقُرْآنَ لِلذِّكْرِ فَهَلْ مِن مُّدَّكِرٍ,And verily We have made the Qur’ān easy to remember We have facilitated its memorisation and disposed it to serve as a source of remembrance. So is there anyone who remember? anyone who will be admonished by it and memorise it? the interrogative here is intended as an imperative in other words memorise it and be admonished by it; none of God’s scriptures is memorised by heart other than it the Qur’ān.
كَذَّبَتْ عَادٌ فَكَيْفَ كَانَ عَذَابِي وَنُذُرِ,‘Ād denied their prophet Hūd and so they were chastised. How then were My chastisement and My warnings? how then was My warning them of the chastisement before it was sent down? In other words it was justified and He explains this chastisement by saying
إِنَّآ أَرْسَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ رِيحاً صَرْصَراً فِي يَوْمِ نَحْسٍ مُّسْتَمِرٍّ,Indeed We unleashed upon them a clamorous wind intensely noisy on a day of prolonged ill fortune nahsin mustamirr means either one of continuous ill fortune or one of severe ill fortune — and this was the last Wednesday of the month —
تَنزِعُ ٱلنَّاسَ كَأَنَّهُمْ أَعْجَازُ نَخْلٍ مُّنقَعِرٍ,tearing people away wrenching them from the holes in the ground in which they had been embedded and flinging them down to the ground head first thereby crushing their necks and severing their heads from their bodies as if they were while lying in this mentioned state trunks of uprooted palm-trees severed and thrown on the ground — they are likened to palm-trees because of their tallness nakhlun ‘palm-trees’ is masculine here but feminine in sūrat al-Hāqqa nakhlun khāwiya ‘fallen down or hollow palm-trees’ Q. 697 in order to harmonise with the end-rhyme of the verses in both instances.
فَكَيْفَ كَانَ عَذَابِي وَنُذُرِ,How then were My chastisement and My warnings?
وَلَقَدْ يَسَّرْنَا ٱلْقُرْآنَ لِلذِّكْرِ فَهَلْ مِن مُّدَّكِرٍ,And verily We have made the Qur’ān easy to remember. So is there anyone who will remember?
كَذَّبَتْ ثَمُودُ بِٱلنُّذُرِ,Thamūd denied the warnings nudhur is the plural of nadhīr with the sense of mundhir that is to say they denied those matters which their prophet Sālih warned them of if they refused to believe in him and to follow him
فَقَالُوۤاْ أَبَشَراً مِّنَّا وَاحِداً نَّتَّبِعُهُ إِنَّآ إِذاً لَّفِي ضَلاَلٍ وَسُعُرٍ,and they said ‘Is it a mortal basharan is in the accusative because it is governed by a succeeding verb alone among us minnā wāhidan are both adjectives of basharan that we are to follow? nattabi‘uhu this explains the verb which renders it basharan ‘mortal’ accusative; the interrogative is meant as a negative in other words why should we follow him when there are many of us and he is only one among us and not a king? That is to say we will not follow him. Then indeed if we were to follow him we would be in error a parting with reason and insanity!
أَءُلْقِيَ الذِّكْرُ عَلَيْهِ مِن بَيْنِنَا بَلْ هُوَ كَذَّابٌ أَشِرٌ,Has the Reminder the revelation been cast read a-ulqiya pronouncing both hamzas or by not pronouncing the second one but in both cases inserting an intervening alif or leaving this insertion out upon him alone from among us? in other words nothing has been revealed to him. Nay but he is a conceited an arrogant and insolent liar in his saying that the mentioned has been revealed to him. God exalted be He says
سَيَعْلَمُونَ غَداً مَّنِ ٱلْكَذَّابُ ٱلأَشِرُ,‘They will know tomorrow in the Hereafter who is the conceited liar and it is them for they will be chastised for having denied their prophet Sālih.
إِنَّا مُرْسِلُواْ ٱلنَّاقَةِ فِتْنَةً لَّهُمْ فَٱرْتَقِبْهُمْ وَٱصْطَبِرْ,Lo! We are sending the She-camel We will bring it forth out of the mountain the rock as they demanded as a trial a test for them that We may try them. So watch them O Sālih await to see what they will do and what will be done with them and remain patient istabir the tā’ here has replaced the tā’ of the 8th form ifta‘ala in other words endure their harm.
وَنَبِّئْهُمْ أَنَّ ٱلْمَآءَ قِسْمَةٌ بَيْنَهُمْ كُلُّ شِرْبٍ مُّحْتَضَرٌ,And inform them that the water is to be divided between them and the She-camel one day for them and the next for it every drinking every portion of water will be attended’ by the people drawing water on their designated day and by the She-camel on its day. They adhered to this regime but eventually became impatient with it and decided to slaughter the She-camel.
فَنَادَوْاْ صَاحِبَهُمْ فَتَعَاطَىٰ فَعَقَرَ,But they called their companion Qudār to slay it so he took he drew his sword and he hamstrung with it the She-camel in other words he slew her in compliance with their wish.
فَكَيْفَ كَانَ عَذَابِي وَنُذُرِ,How then were My chastisement and My warnings? My warning them of chastisement before it was sent down? In other words it was justified. He explains it their chastisement by saying
إِنَّآ أَرْسَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ صَيْحَةً وَاحِدَةً فَكَانُواْ كَهَشِيمِ ٱلْمُحْتَظِرِ,Indeed We unleashed upon them a single Cry and they became like the chaff of a corral builder al-muhtazir is one who makes a pen from dried tree-branches and thorns for his sheep to protect them from wolves and beasts of prey; the fallen parts which they tread are called hashīm.
وَلَقَد يَسَّرْنَا ٱلْقُرْآنَ لِلذِّكْرِ فَهَلْ مِن مُّدَّكِرٍ,And verily We have made the Qur’ān easy to remember. So is there anyone who will remember?
كَذَّبَتْ قَوْمُ لُوطٍ بِٱلنُّذُرِ,The people of Lot denied the warnings they denied those issues of which they were warned by his Lot’s tongue.
إِنَّآ أَرْسَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ حَاصِباً إِلاَّ آلَ لُوطٍ نَّجَّيْنَاهُم بِسَحَرٍ,Indeed We unleashed upon them a squall of pebbles a wind hurling at them pebbles namely small stones a single one of these being no larger than the palm of the hand and they were destroyed; all except the family of Lot namely his two daughters together with him whom We delivered at dawn from among the dawns the morning time of an unspecified day had a specific day been meant for that mentioned dawn it sahar would have been treated as a diptote instead of the declined form saharin being a definite noun derived from al-sahar for with definite nouns one ought to use the preceding definite article al. So was the squall unleashed at first with the family of Lot still there? There are two opinions regarding this in the case of the former that it was unleashed upon them including the family of Lot the exception is understood as a continuous one while in the case of the latter opinion that they were delivered before the squall the exception is understood as a discontinuous one even if it ‘the family of Lot’ is actually subsumed by the collective noun ‘the people of Lot’ and so they were delivered as a kindness from God;
نِّعْمَةً مِّنْ عِندِنَا كَذَلِكَ نَجْزِي مَن شَكَرَ,as a grace ni‘matan is a verbal noun that is to say in‘āman ‘an act of grace’ from Us. So like that requital do We requite him who gives thanks for Our graces and is a believer or it means him who is a believer in God and His messenger and is obedient to both.
وَلَقَدْ أَنذَرَهُمْ بَطْشَتَنَا فَتَمَارَوْاْ بِٱلنُّذُرِ,And verily he had warned them Lot had threatened them of Our strike Our seizing them with chastisement but they disputed they contested and denied the warnings his warning.
وَلَقَدْ رَاوَدُوهُ عَن ضَيْفِهِ فَطَمَسْنَآ أَعْيُنَهُمْ فَذُوقُواْ عَذَابِي وَنُذُرِ,And they had even solicited of him his guests that he should let them have their own way with those who had come to him as guests that they may do wicked things with them — and these guests were angels. So We blotted out their eyes We blinded them and made them without slits so that they were continuous folds of skin like the rest of the face by having Gabriel smack them with his wing. ‘So taste now so We said to them taste My chastisement and My warnings’ that is to say taste the effects and the substance of My warning and My threat.
وَلَقَدْ صَبَّحَهُم بُكْرَةً عَذَابٌ مُّسْتَقِرٌّ,And verily there greeted them in the early morning the morning time of an unspecified day an abiding chastisement a permanent chastisement continuous with the chastisement of the Hereafter.
فَذُوقُواْ عَذَابِي وَنُذُرِ,‘So taste now My chastisement and My warnings!’

Or have you O disbelievers of Quraysh been granted some immunity from chastisement in the Scriptures? the Books? the interrogative in both instances is meant as a denial in other words it is not so.
أَمْ يَقُولُونَ نَحْنُ جَمِيعٌ مُّنتَصِرٌ,Or do they the disbelievers of Quraysh say ‘We are a host that will be helped to victory’? against Muhammad (s)? When Abū Jahl on the day of Badr said ‘We are a host that will be helped to victory’ the following was revealed
سَيُهْزَمُ ٱلْجَمْعُ وَيُوَلُّونَ ٱلدُّبُرَ,The host will truly be routed and turn its back to flee and so they were defeated at Badr and God’s Messenger s was granted victory over them.
بَلِ ٱلسَّاعَةُ مَوْعِدُهُمْ وَٱلسَّاعَةُ أَدْهَىٰ وَأَمَرُّ,Nay but the Hour is their tryst for chastisement and the Hour that is the chastisement thereat will be more calamitous greater in affliction and more bitter than the chastisement of this world.

إِنَّا كُلَّ شَيْءٍ خَلَقْنَاهُ بِقَدَرٍ,Truly everything read inna kulla shay’in is in the accusative as a dependent clause because of a verb governing it have We created in a measure by ordainment bi-qadarin ‘in a measure’ is a circumstantial qualifier referring to kulla ‘every’ in other words ‘already predetermined’; a variant reading for kulla has nominative kullu as the subject the predicate of which is khalaqnāhu ‘We have created’.
وَمَآ أَمْرُنَآ إِلاَّ وَاحِدَةٌ كَلَمْحٍ بِٱلْبَصَرِ,And Our command for a thing which We want to bring into existence is but a single word like the twinkling of an eye in terms of speed and this is the saying of kun ‘Be’ whereat it comes into existence.

They will say ‘Yes indeed! But you caused your souls to fall into temptation by engaging in hypocrisy and you awaited reversals of fortune for the believers and you doubted you were uncertain about the religion of Islam and false hopes greedy desires deceived you until God’s ordinance death came; and the Deceiver Satan deceived you concerning God.
فَٱلْيَوْمَ لاَ يُؤْخَذُ مِنكُمْ فِدْيَةٌ وَلاَ مِنَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مَأْوَاكُمُ ٱلنَّارُ هِيَ مَوْلاَكُمْ وَبِئْسَ ٱلْمَصِيرُ,So on this day no ransom will be taken from you read tu’khadhu or yu’khadhu nor from those who disbelieved. Your abode will be the Fire it will be your guardian it is the place truly deserving of you and an evil destination!’ it is.
أَلَمْ يَأْنِ لِلَّذِينَ آمَنُوۤاْ أَن تَخْشَعَ قُلُوبُهُمْ لِذِكْرِ ٱللَّهِ وَمَا نَزَلَ مِنَ ٱلْحَقِّ وَلاَ يَكُونُواْ كَٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ ٱلْكِتَابَ مِن قَبْلُ فَطَالَ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلأَمَدُ فَقَسَتْ قُلُوبُهُمْ وَكَثِيرٌ مِّنْهُمْ فَاسِقُونَ,Is it not time for those who believe — this was revealed concerning the matter of the Companions of the Prophet who had been overindulging in jest that their hearts should be humbled to the remembrance of God and to what has been revealed read as nuzzila; or read nazala ‘what has come down’ of the truth the Qur’ān and that they should not be lā yakūnū is a supplement to takhsha‘a ‘be humbled’ like those who were given the Scripture before? namely the Jews and the Christians. For the stretch of time the interval extending from them back to the time of the sending of the last of their prophets was too long for them and so their hearts became hardened unyielding to the remembrance of God and many of them are immoral.
ٱعْلَمُوۤاْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُحْيِـي ٱلأَرْضَ بَعْدَ مَوْتِهَا قَدْ بَيَّنَّا لَكُمُ ٱلآيَاتِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ,Know — an address to the believers just mentioned — that God revives the earth after its death by bringing forth vegetation and likewise He is able to do with your hearts restoring them to humbleness. We have certainly made clear for you the signs that testify to Our power with this mentioned example and others that perhaps you may understand.
إِنَّ ٱلْمُصَّدِّقِينَ وَٱلْمُصَّدِّقَاتِ وَأَقْرَضُواْ ٱللَّهَ قَرْضاً حَسَناً يُضَاعَفُ لَهُمْ وَلَهُمْ أَجْرٌ كَرِيمٌ,Indeed men who give voluntary alms al-mussaddiqīna derives from the infinitive al-tasadduq ‘to give voluntary alms’; the tā’ of the original mutasaddiqīna has been assimilated with the sād and women who give voluntary alms a variant reading for both has the softened form with a single sād musaddiqīna and musaddiqāti which derives from al-tasdīq ‘to affirm the truth of’ ‘to believe in’ and those of them who have lent God a goodly loan this refers back to both the men and women with the masculine plural of predominance; the supplementing of a verb aqradū ‘who lent’ to a noun of action al-mussaddiqāt at the point of the relative clause of the al- is because in that position it the noun functions as a verb; the mention of the ‘loan’ together with its qualification ‘goodly’ after the mention of ‘the giving of voluntary alms’ is intended to define it it will be multiplied yudā‘afu is also read as yuda‘‘afu namely their loan will multiplied for them and they will have a generous reward.
وَٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ بِٱللَّهِ وَرُسُلِهِ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلصِّدِّيقُونَ وَٱلشُّهَدَآءُ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ لَهُمْ أَجْرُهُمْ وَنُورُهُمْ وَٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَكَذَّبُواْ بِآيَاتِنَآ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ أَصْحَابُ ٱلْجَحِيمِ,And those who believe in God and His messengers — they are the truthful al-siddīqūna those who go to the greatest lengths to be truthful and the witnesses with their Lord against the deniers of all communities; they will have their reward and their light. But those who disbelieve and deny Our signs those signs that testify to the truth of Our Oneness — they will be the inhabitants of Hell-fire.
ٱعْلَمُوۤاْ أَنَّمَا ٱلْحَيَٰوةُ ٱلدُّنْيَا لَعِبٌ وَلَهْوٌ وَزِينَةٌ وَتَفَاخُرٌ بَيْنَكُمْ وَتَكَاثُرٌ فِي ٱلأَمْوَٰلِ وَٱلأَوْلَٰدِ كَمَثَلِ غَيْثٍ أَعْجَبَ ٱلْكُفَّارَ نَبَاتُهُ ثُمَّ يَهِيجُ فَتَرَٰهُ مُصْفَرّاً ثُمَّ يَكُونُ حُطَٰماً وَفِي ٱلآخِرَةِ عَذَابٌ شَدِيدٌ وَمَغْفِرَةٌ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَرِضْوَٰنٌ وَمَا ٱلْحَيَٰوةُ ٱلدُّنْيَآ إِلاَّ مَتَٰعُ ٱلْغُرُورِ,Know that the life of this world is merely play and diversion and glitter the frequent adornment of oneself and mutual vainglory in respect of wealth and children that is preoccupation with such things — but as for acts of obedience and incentives thereto these are the concerns of the Hereafter; as the likeness of that is to say it in the manner in which you admire it and in the manner in which it will disappear is as the likeness of rain whose vegetation which results from this rain the disbelievers the sowers admire; but then it withers it becomes dried-up and you see it turn yellow then it becomes chaff scatters vanishing with the winds. And in the Hereafter there is a severe chastisement for those who prefer this world to it and forgiveness from God and beatitude for those who have not preferred this world to it; and the life of this world that is to say the comfort enjoyed in it is but the comfort of delusion.
سَابِقُوۤاْ إِلَىٰ مَغْفِرَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَجَنَّةٍ عَرْضُهَا كَعَرْضِ ٱلسَّمَآءِ وَٱلأَرْضِ أُعِدَّتْ لِلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ بِٱللَّهِ وَرُسُلِهِ ذَلِكَ فَضْلُ ٱللَّهِ يُؤْتِيهِ مَن يَشَآءُ وَٱللَّهُ ذُو ٱلْفَضْلِ ٱلْعَظِيمِ,Vie with one another for forgiveness from your Lord and a garden the breadth of which is as the breadth of the heaven and the earth if one were placed at the end of the other prepared for those who believe in God and His messengers. That is the bounty of God which He gives to whomever He will and God is dispenser of tremendous bounty.
مَآ أَصَابَ مِن مُّصِيبَةٍ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَلاَ فِيۤ أَنفُسِكُمْ إِلاَّ فِي كِتَٰبٍ مِّن قَبْلِ أَن نَّبْرَأَهَآ إِنَّ ذَٰلِكَ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ يَسِيرٌ,No affliction befalls in the earth by way of drought for example or in yourselves such as illness or the loss of a child but it is in a Book meaning the Preserved Tablet al-lawh al-mahfūz before We bring it about before We create it — the same is said to be true of God’s graces — that is indeed easy for God
لِّكَيْلاَ تَأْسَوْاْ عَلَىٰ مَا فَاتَكُمْ وَلاَ تَفْرَحُواْ بِمَآ آتَاكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ لاَ يُحِبُّ كُلَّ مُخْتَالٍ فَخُورٍ,so that you may not kay-lā kay makes a verb subjunctive with the same sense as an as in an-lā ‘so that … not’ that is to say God informs you of this so that you may not grieve for what escapes you nor exult with a wanton exultation rather an exultation that is followed by a thanksgiving for the grace at what He has given you read thus as ātākum; or read as atākum meaning ‘at what has come to you from Him’. For God does not like any swaggering braggart swaggering in arrogance because of what he has been given boastful of it to people;
ٱلَّذِينَ يَبْخَلُونَ وَيَأْمُرُونَ ٱلنَّاسَ بِٱلْبُخْلِ وَمَن يَتَوَلَّ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ هُوَ ٱلْغَنِيُّ ٱلْحَمِيدُ,such as are niggardly in their duties and bid people to be niggardly in these too against such there is a severe threat of chastisement. And whoever turns away from what is his duty still God He is indeed huwa ‘He’ is a separating pronoun; a variant reading drops it the Independent without need of anyone other than Him the Praiser of His friends.
لَقَدْ أَرْسَلْنَا رُسُلَنَا بِٱلْبَيِّنَاتِ وَأَنزَلْنَا مَعَهُمُ ٱلْكِتَابَ وَٱلْمِيزَانَ لِيَقُومَ ٱلنَّاسُ بِٱلْقِسْطِ وَأَنزَلْنَا ٱلْحَدِيدَ فِيهِ بَأْسٌ شَدِيدٌ وَمَنَافِعُ لِلنَّاسِ وَلِيَعْلَمَ ٱللَّهُ مَن يَنصُرُهُ وَرُسُلَهُ بِٱلْغَيْبِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ قَوِيٌّ عَزِيزٌ,We have verily sent Our messengers the angels to prophets with clear signs with the definitive proofs and We revealed with them the Scripture and the Balance justice so that mankind may uphold justice. And We sent down iron We caused it to be extracted from mineral ores wherein is great might with which one may wage battle and many uses for mankind and so that God may know a knowledge of direct vision li-ya‘lama’Llāhu is a supplement to li-yaqūma’l-nāsu ‘so that mankind may uphold’ those who help Him by helping to uphold His religion through the use of instruments of war made of metal and otherwise and His messengers through the Unseen bi’l-ghaybi a circumstantial qualifier referring to the suffixed pronoun hā’ ‘Him’ of yansuruhu ‘who aid Him’ that is to say while He God is not seen by them in this world. Ibn ‘Abbās said ‘They help Him even though they do not see Him’ yansurūnahu wa-lā yubsirūnahu. Assuredly God is Strong Mighty without any need of being helped but such help benefits those who proffer it.
وَلَقَدْ أَرْسَلْنَا نُوحاً وَإِبْرَاهِيمَ وَجَعَلْنَا فِي ذُرِّيَّتِهِمَا ٱلنُّبُوَّةَ وَٱلْكِتَابَ فَمِنْهُمْ مُّهْتَدٍ وَكَثِيرٌ مِّنْهُمْ فَاسِقُونَ,And verily We sent Noah and Abraham and We ordained among their seed prophethood and the Scripture meaning the four Books the Torah the Gospel the Psalms and the Furqān all of which have been revealed among the seed of Abraham; and some of them are rightly guided and many of them are immoral.
ثُمَّ قَفَّيْنَا عَلَىٰ آثَارِهِم بِرُسُلِنَا وَقَفَّيْنَا بِعِيسَى ٱبْنِ مَرْيَمَ وَآتَيْنَاهُ ٱلإِنجِيلَ وَجَعَلْنَا فِي قُلُوبِ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱتَّبَعُوهُ رَأْفَةً وَرَحْمَةً وَرَهْبَانِيَّةً ٱبتَدَعُوهَا مَا كَتَبْنَاهَا عَلَيْهِمْ إِلاَّ ٱبْتِغَآءَ رِضْوَانِ ٱللَّهِ فَمَا رَعَوْهَا حَقَّ رِعَايَتِهَا فَآتَيْنَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ مِنْهُمْ أَجْرَهُمْ وَكَثِيرٌ مِّنْهُمْ فَاسِقُونَ,Then We sent to follow in their footsteps Our messengers and We sent to follow Jesus son of Mary and We gave him the Gospel and We placed in the hearts of those who followed him kindness and mercy. But as for monasticism namely abstention from women and seclusion in monasteries they invented it an innovation on their part — We had not prescribed it for them We did not enjoin them to it; but they took it on — only seeking God’s beatitude. Yet they did not observe it with due observance for many of them abandoned it and rejected the religion of Jesus and embraced the religion of their then king. However many of them did remain upon the religion of Jesus and they believed in our Prophet when he came. So We gave those of them who believed in him their reward; but many of them are immoral.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ ٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَءَامِنُواْ بِرَسُولِهِ يُؤْتِكُمْ كِفْلَيْنِ مِن رَّحْمَتِهِ وَيَجْعَل لَّكُمْ نُوراً تَمْشُونَ بِهِ وَيَغْفِرْ لَكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,O you who believe in Jesus fear God and believe in His Messenger Muhammad (s) and Jesus and He will give you a twofold portion share of His mercy for your belief in both prophets; and He will assign for you a light by which you will walk across the Path over Hell and into Paradise and forgive you; for God is Forgiving Merciful;
لِّئَلاَّ يَعْلَمَ أَهْلُ ٱلْكِتَابِ أَلاَّ يَقْدِرُونَ عَلَىٰ شَيْءٍ مِّن فَضْلِ ٱللَّهِ وَأَنَّ ٱلْفَضْلَ بِيَدِ ٱللَّهِ يُؤْتِيهِ مَن يَشَآءُ وَٱللَّهُ ذُو ٱلْفَضْلِ ٱلْعَظِيمِ,So that the People of the Scripture the Torah — those who did not believe in Muhammad (s) — may know in other words I inform you of this so that they the People of the Scripture may know that a of a-llā is softened in place of the hardened form an-lā its subject being the pronoun of the matter that is to say understand it as being annahum they have no power over anything of God’s bounty contrary to their claims that they are God’s beloved and those who deserve His beatitude and that all bounty is in God’s hand; He gives it to whomever He will and hence He has given the believers in the Prophet among them their reward twofold as stated above; and God is dispenser of tremendous bounty.
قَدْ سَمِعَ ٱللَّهُ قَوْلَ ٱلَّتِي تُجَادِلُكَ فِي زَوْجِهَا وَتَشْتَكِيۤ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ وَٱللَّهُ يَسْمَعُ تَحَاوُرَكُمآ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ سَمِيعٌ بَصِيرٌ,God has certainly heard the words of her who disputes with you her who consults you O Prophet concerning her husband who has repudiated her by zihār — he had said to her ‘You are to me as untouchable as the back of my mother’. She asked the Prophet s about this and he told her that she was thenceforth forbidden to him as was customary among them at the time of Jāhiliyya namely that repudiation by zihār results in permanent separation. She was Khawla bt. Tha‘laba and he was Aws b. al-Sāmit — and complains to God of her being alone and of her impoverishment while having young children whom if she were to leave with him they would go astray but whom if they remained with her would go hungry. And God hears your conversation your consulting. Assuredly God is Hearer Seer He is Knower.
ٱلَّذِينَ يُظَاهِرُونَ مِنكُمْ مِّن نِّسَآئِهِمْ مَّا هُنَّ أُمَّهَاتِهِمْ إِنْ أُمَّهَاتُهُمْ إِلاَّ ٱللاَّئِي وَلَدْنَهُمْ وَإِنَّهُمْ لَيَقُولُونَ مُنكَراً مِّنَ ٱلْقَوْلِ وَزُوراً وَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَعَفُوٌّ غَفُورٌ,Those of you who repudiate their wives by zihār yazzahharūna is actually yatazahharūna in which the tā’ has been assimilated with the zā’; a variant reading has yazzāharūna and still another has yuzāhirūna similar in form to yuqātilūna; the same applies for the second instance of this verb below they are not their mothers; their mothers are only those who read allā’ī or without the final long yā’ allā’i gave birth to them and indeed they in repudiating them by zihār utter indecent words and a calumny a lie. Yet assuredly God is Pardoning Forgiving to the one who repudiates by zihār through an atonement which he must offer.
وَٱلَّذِينَ يُظَاهِرُونَ مِن نِّسَآئِهِمْ ثُمَّ يَعُودُونَ لِمَا قَالُواْ فَتَحْرِيرُ رَقَبَةٍ مِّن قَبْلِ أَن يَتَمَآسَّا ذَلِكُمْ تُوعَظُونَ بِهِ وَٱللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيرٌ,And those who repudiate their wives by zihār and then go back on what they have said instead doing the opposite of this and retaining the woman divorced by zihār that which is contrary to the purpose of zihār in which a woman is characterised as being forbidden — then the penalty for them is the setting free of a slave an obligation upon him before they touch one another in sexual intercourse. By this you are being admonished; and God is Aware of what you do.
فَمَن لَّمْ يَجِدْ فَصِيَامُ شَهْرَيْنِ مُتَتَابِعَيْنِ مِن قَبْلِ أَن يَتَمَآسَّا فَمَن لَّمْ يَسْتَطِعْ فَإِطْعَامُ سِتِّينَ مِسْكِيناً ذَلِكَ لِتُؤْمِنُواْ بِٱللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ وَتِلْكَ حُدُودُ ٱللَّهِ وَلِلْكَافِرِينَ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,And he who cannot find the wherewithal to set free a slave then his redemption shall be the fasting of two successive months before they touch one another. And if he is unable to fast then the redemption shall be the feeding of sixty needy persons as an obligation upon him that is before they touch one another understanding the unrestricted prescription as having the same restriction as the restricted one. For every needy person he should give one mudd measure of the principal food of the town. This namely lightening of the atonement is so that you may believe in God and His Messenger. And these namely the rulings mentioned are God’s bounds; and for the rejecters of them there is a painful chastisement.
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يُحَآدُّونَ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ كُبِتُواْ كَمَا كُبِتَ ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ وَقَدْ أَنزَلْنَآ آيَاتٍ بَيِّنَاتٍ وَلِلْكَافِرِينَ عَذَابٌ مُّهِينٌ,Indeed those who oppose God and His Messenger will be abased humiliated just as those before them were abased for opposing their messengers. And verily We have revealed clear signs indicating the truthfulness of the Messenger and for those who disbelieve in the signs there is a humiliating chastisement.
يَوْمَ يَبْعَثُهُمُ ٱللَّهُ جَمِيعاً فَيُنَبِّئُهُمْ بِمَا عَمِلُوۤاْ أَحْصَاهُ ٱللَّهُ وَنَسُوهُ وَٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ شَهِيدٌ,The day when God will raise them all together He will then inform them of what they did. God has kept count of it while they forgot it. And God is Witness to all things.
أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَعْلَمُ مَا فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِي ٱلأَرْضِ مَا يَكُونُ مِن نَّجْوَىٰ ثَلاَثَةٍ إِلاَّ هُوَ رَابِعُهُمْ وَلاَ خَمْسَةٍ إِلاَّ هُوَ سَادِسُهُمْ وَلاَ أَدْنَىٰ مِن ذَلِكَ وَلاَ أَكْثَرَ إِلاَّ هُوَ مَعَهُمْ أَيْنَ مَا كَانُواْ ثُمَّ يُنَبِّئُهُم بِمَا عَمِلُواْ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عَلِيمٌ,Have you not seen have you not realised that God knows all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth? Not secret conversation of three takes place but He is their fourth companion by virtue of His omniscience nor of five but He is their sixth nor of fewer than that or more but He is with them wherever they may be. Then He will inform them of what they did on the Day of Resurrection. Assuredly God has knowledge of all things.
أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى ٱلَّذِينَ نُهُواْ عَنِ ٱلنَّجْوَىٰ ثُمَّ يَعُودُونَ لِمَا نُهُواْ عَنْهُ وَيَتَنَاجَوْنَ بِٱلإِثْمِ وَٱلْعُدْوَانِ وَمَعْصِيَتِ ٱلرَّسُولِ وَإِذَا جَآءُوكَ حَيَّوْكَ بِمَا لَمْ يُحَيِّكَ بِهِ ٱللَّهُ وَيَقُولُونَ فِيۤ أَنفُسِهِمْ لَوْلاَ يُعَذِّبُنَا ٱللَّهُ بِمَا نَقُولُ حَسْبُهُمْ جَهَنَّمُ يَصْلَوْنَهَا فَبِئْسَ ٱلْمَصِيرُ,Have you not seen have you not observed those who were forbidden from conversing in secret but then returned to that they had been forbidden and all the while hold secret conversations tainted with sin and plans for enmity and disobedience to the Messenger? These were the Jews whom the Prophet s had forbidden them what they used to do in their secret talks that is their habit of conversing secretly with one another and giving the believers looks in order to cast doubt into their hearts about the faith. And who when they come to you they greet you O Prophet with that with which God never greeted you — namely their saying to the Prophet al-sāmu ‘alayka meaning ‘Death be upon you’ and they say within themselves ‘Why does God not chastise us for what we say?’ in the way of such a greeting and our saying that he is not a prophet if he truly were a prophet. Hell will suffice them! In it they will be made to burn — and what an evil journey’s end! it is.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُوۤاْ إِذَا تَنَاجَيْتُمْ فَلاَ تَتَنَاجَوْاْ بِٱلإِثْمِ وَٱلْعُدْوَانِ وَمَعْصِيَتِ ٱلرَّسُولِ وَتَنَاجَوْاْ بِٱلْبِرِّ وَٱلتَّقْوَىٰ وَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ ٱلَّذِيۤ إِلَيْهِ تُحْشَرُونَ,O you who believe if you do talk in secret then do not talk in secret sinfully and in enmity and disobedience to the Messenger but talk secretly in piety and fear of God. And fear God to Whom you will be gathered.
إِنَّمَا ٱلنَّجْوَىٰ مِنَ ٱلشَّيْطَانِ لِيَحْزُنَ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَلَيْسَ بِضَآرِّهِمْ شَيْئاً إِلاَّ بِإِذْنِ ٱللَّهِ وَعَلَى ٱللَّهِ فَلْيَتَوَكَّلِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ,Secret conversations tainted with sin and the like are of the work of Satan a result of his deception that those who believe may end up grieving; but he cannot harm them in any way except God’s leave that is except by His will. And in God let the believers put all their trust.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ إِذَا قِيلَ لَكُمْ تَفَسَّحُواْ فِي ٱلْمَجَالِسِ فَٱفْسَحُواْ يَفْسَحِ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمْ وَإِذَا قِيلَ ٱنشُزُواْ فَانشُزُواْ يَرْفَعِ ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ مِنكُمْ وَٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ ٱلْعِلْمَ دَرَجَاتٍ وَٱللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيرٌ,O you who believe when it is said to you ‘Make room’ during the assembly during the assembly convened with the Prophet s or for remembrance so that those arriving to join you may find room to sit al-majlis ‘assembly’ may also be read in the plural al-majālis then make room; God will make room for you in Paradise. And when it is said ‘Rise up’ stand up for prayer or for other good deeds do rise up a variant reading for unshuzū fa’nshuzū has anshizū in both instances sc. anshizū fa’nshizū; God will raise those of you who have faith thereby obeying this command and He will raise those who have been given knowledge by degrees in Paradise. And God is Aware of what you do.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ إِذَا نَاجَيْتُمُ ٱلرَّسُولَ فَقَدِّمُواْ بَيْنَ يَدَيْ نَجْوَاكُمْ صَدَقَةً ذَلِكَ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ وَأَطْهَرُ فَإِن لَّمْ تَجِدُواْ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,O you who believe when you converse in secret with the Messenger when you wish to converse with him privately offer some voluntary alms before your secret talk. That is better for you and purer for your sins. But if you find nothing to offer as alms then God is indeed Forgiving of your secret conversation Merciful to you. In other words nothing will be held against you for holding a secret conversation without having offered some voluntary alms beforehand. However He God abrogated this later by saying
ءَأَشْفَقْتُمْ أَن تُقَدِّمُواْ بَيْنَ يَدَيْ نَجْوَاكُمْ صَدَقَاتٍ فَإِذْ لَمْ تَفْعَلُواْ وَتَابَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْكُمْ فَأَقِيمُواْ ٱلصَّلاَةَ وَآتُواْ ٱلزَّكَاةَ وَأَطِيعُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ وَٱللَّهُ خَبِيرٌ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ,Do you fear read a-ashfaqtum either pronouncing both hamzas fully or by replacing the second one with an alif or not pronouncing it but inserting an alif between the one not unpronounced and the other one or without this insertion poverty when you fear to offer voluntary alms before your secret talks. So as you did not do this giving of voluntary alms and God relented to you waiving this requirement for you maintain prayer and pay the alms and obey God and His Messenger that is to say observe these duties regularly. For God is Aware of what you do.
أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى ٱلَّذِينَ تَوَلَّوْاْ قَوْماً غَضِبَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْهِم مَّا هُم مِّنكُمْ وَلاَ مِنْهُمْ وَيَحْلِفُونَ عَلَى ٱلْكَذِبِ وَهُمْ يَعْلَمُونَ,Have you not regarded have you not seen those who — these being the hypocrites — fraternise with a folk — these being the Jews — at whom God is wrathful? They the hypocrites neither belong with you the believers nor with them the Jews but are suspended in between and they swear falsely in other words saying that they are believers while they know that they are lying in this.
أَعَدَّ ٱللَّهُ لَهُمْ عَذَاباً شَدِيداً إِنَّهُمْ سَآءَ مَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ,God has prepared for them a severe chastisement. Evil indeed is that which they are wont to do in the way of acts of disobedience.
ٱتَّخَذْوۤاْ أَيْمَانَهُمْ جُنَّةً فَصَدُّواْ عَن سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ فَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ مُّهِينٌ,They have taken their oaths as a shield a means of protection for themselves and their possessions and so they bar thereby the believers from the way of God that is from engaging in a struggle against them thereby slaying them and seizing their possessions. So for them there will be a humiliating chastisement.
لَّن تُغْنِيَ عَنْهُمْ أَمْوَالُهُمْ وَلاَ أَوْلاَدُهُمْ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ شَيْئاً أُوْلَـٰئِكَ أَصْحَابُ ٱلنَّارِ هُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ,Neither their possessions nor their children will avail them in any way against God against His chastisement. Those — they are the inhabitants of the Fire wherein they will abide.
يَوْمَ يَبْعَثُهُمُ ٱللَّهُ جَمِيعاً فَيَحْلِفُونَ لَهُ كَمَا يَحْلِفُونَ لَكُمْ وَيَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّهُمْ عَلَىٰ شَيْءٍ أَلاَ إِنَّهُمْ هُمُ ٱلْكَاذِبُونَ,Mention the day when God will raise them all together whereupon they will swear to Him that they are believers just as they swear to you now and suppose that they are standing on something beneficial by swearing in Hereafter just as they supposed it to have been beneficial for them in this world. Yet assuredly it is they who are the liars!
ٱسْتَحْوَذَ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلشَّيْطَانُ فَأَنسَاهُمْ ذِكْرَ ٱللَّهِ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ حِزْبُ الشَّيْطَانِ أَلاَ إِنَّ حِزْبَ الشَّيْطَانِ هُمُ الخَاسِرُونَ,Satan has prevailed upon them by their obedience of him and so he has caused them to forget the remembrance of God. Those are Satan’s confederates his followers. Yet it is indeed Satan’s confederates who are the losers!
إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يُحَآدُّونَ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ فِي ٱلأَذَلِّينَ,Indeed those who oppose God and His Messenger — they will be among the most abased the vanquished.
كَتَبَ ٱللَّهُ لأَغْلِبَنَّ أَنَاْ وَرُسُلِيۤ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ قَوِيٌّ عَزِيزٌ,God has inscribed in the Preserved Tablet or it means He has decreed ‘I shall assuredly prevail I and My messengers’ by means of definitive proof or the sword. Truly God is Strong Mighty.
لاَّ تَجِدُ قَوْماً يُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلآخِرِ يُوَآدُّونَ مَنْ حَآدَّ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ وَلَوْ كَانُوۤاْ آبَآءَهُمْ أَوْ أَبْنَآءَهُمْ أَوْ إِخْوَانَهُمْ أَوْ عَشِيرَتَهُمْ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ كَتَبَ فِي قُلُوبِهِمُ ٱلإِيمَانَ وَأَيَّدَهُمْ بِرُوحٍ مِّنْهُ وَيُدْخِلُهُمْ جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلأَنْهَارُ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا رَضِيَ ٱللَّهُ عَنْهُمْ وَرَضُواْ عَنْهُ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ حِزْبُ ٱللَّهِ أَلاَ إِنَّ حِزْبَ ٱللَّهِ هُمُ ٱلْمُفْلِحُونَ,You will not find a people who believe in God and the Last Day loving befriending those who oppose God and His Messenger even though they the opposers were their fathers that is to say the believers’ fathers or their sons or their brothers or their clan rather you will find that they intend to do them harm and they fight them over the question of faith as occurred on one occasion with some Companions may God be pleased with them. For those the ones who are not loving of them He has inscribed He has established faith upon their hearts and reinforced them with a spirit a light from Him exalted be He and He will admit them into gardens underneath which rivers flow wherein they will abide God being pleased with them for their obedience of Him and they being pleased with Him because of His reward. Those they are God’s confederates following His command and refraining from what He has forbidden. Assuredly it is God’s confederates who are the successful the winners.
سَبَّحَ لِلَّهِ مَا فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَهُوَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ,All that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth glorifies God that is to say all that is in them exalts Him as being transcendent the lām of li’Llāhi ‘God’ is extra; the use of mā instead of the personal min is meant to indicate a predominance of non-rational beings in the heavens and the earth. And He is the Mighty the Wise in His kingdom and in His actions respectively.
هُوَ ٱلَّذِيۤ أَخْرَجَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِنْ أَهْلِ ٱلْكِتَابِ مِن دِيَارِهِمْ لأَوَّلِ ٱلْحَشْرِ مَا ظَنَنتُمْ أَن يَخْرُجُواْ وَظَنُّوۤاْ أَنَّهُمْ مَّانِعَتُهُمْ حُصُونُهُم مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ فَأَتَاهُمُ ٱللَّهُ مِنْ حَيْثُ لَمْ يَحْتَسِبُواْ وَقَذَفَ فِي قُلُوبِهِمُ ٱلرُّعْبَ يُخْرِبُونَ بُيُوتَهُمْ بِأَيْدِيهِمْ وَأَيْدِي ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ فَٱعْتَبِرُواْ يٰأُوْلِي ٱلأَبْصَارِ,It is He Who expelled those who disbelieved of the People of the Scripture namely the Jews of the Banū al-Nadīr from their homelands from their dwellings at Medina at the first exile that is their exile to Syria the last exile being their banishment to Khaybar by ‘Umar during his caliphate. You did not think O believers that they would go forth and they thought that they would be protected māni‘atuhum is the predicate of an ‘that’ by their fortresses husūnuhum the agent of the verb māni‘atuhum with which the predication is completed from God from His chastisement. But God His command and His chastisement came at them from whence they had not reckoned from whence had never occurred to them from the part of the believers and He cast terror ru‘b or ru‘ub into their hearts by having their chief Ka‘b b. al-Ashraf slain destroying as they did read yukharribūna; or yukhribūna derived from 4th form akhraba their houses in order to take away with them what they valued of wood and so on with their own hands and the hands of the believers. So take heed O you who have eyes!
وَلَوْلاَ أَن كَتَبَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلْجَلاَءَ لَعَذَّبَهُمْ فِي ٱلدُّنْيَا وَلَهُمْ فِي ٱلآخِرَةِ عَذَابُ ٱلنَّارِ,And had God not prescribed had He not decreed banishment for them departure from their homeland He would have chastised them in this world by having them killed or taken captive as He did with the Jews of Banū Qurayza and in the Hereafter there is for them the chastisement of the Fire.
ذَلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ شَآقُّواْ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ وَمَن يُشَآقِّ ٱللَّهَ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ شَدِيدُ ٱلْعِقَابِ,That is because they defied they opposed God and His Messenger; and whoever defies God indeed God is severe in retribution against him.
مَا قَطَعْتُمْ مِّن لِّينَةٍ أَوْ تَرَكْتُمُوهَا قَآئِمَةً عَلَىٰ أُصُولِهَا فَبِإِذْنِ ٱللَّهِ وَلِيُخْزِيَ ٱلْفَاسِقِينَ,Whatever palm-trees you cut down O Muslims or left standing on their roots it was by God’s leave He gave you the choice in this matter and in order that by giving you leave to cut them down He might disgrace those who are immoral the Jews in return for their objection that the cutting down of productive trees was deliberate spoiling of the land.
وَمَآ أَفَآءَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ رَسُولِهِ مِنْهُمْ فَمَآ أَوْجَفْتُمْ عَلَيْهِ مِنْ خَيْلٍ وَلاَ رِكَابٍ وَلَـٰكِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُسَلِّطُ رُسُلَهُ عَلَىٰ مَن يَشَآءُ وَٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,And whatever spoils God has given to His Messenger from these you did not O Muslims spur for it any min is extra horses or camels that is to say you did not suffer any hardship in securing it but God gives His messengers sway over whomever He will and God has power over all things hence you have no right to any of this booty rather it is exclusively for the Prophet s and those of the four categories mentioned with him in the next verse to be dispensed in accordance with the way in which he used to divide it up such that each would receive a fifth of the fifth and the rest being the Prophet’s s for him to do with as he pleases — thus he gave of it to the Emigrants and three from among the Helpers on account of their poverty.
مَّآ أَفَآءَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ رَسُولِهِ مِنْ أَهْلِ ٱلْقُرَىٰ فَلِلَّهِ وَلِلرَّسُولِ وَلِذِي ٱلْقُرْبَىٰ وَٱلْيَتَامَىٰ وَٱلْمَسَاكِينِ وَٱبْنِ ٱلسَّبِيلِ كَيْ لاَ يَكُونَ دُولَةً بَيْنَ ٱلأَغْنِيَآءِ مِنكُمْ وَمَآ آتَاكُمُ ٱلرَّسُولُ فَخُذُوهُ وَمَا نَهَاكُمْ عَنْهُ فَٱنتَهُواْ وَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ شَدِيدُ ٱلْعِقَابِ,Whatever spoils God has given to His Messenger from the people of the towns such as al-Safrā’ Wādī al-Qurā and Yanbu‘ belong to God dispensing with it as He will and to the Messenger and to the near of kin the Prophet’s kin from among the Banū Hāshim and the Banū al-Muttālib and the orphans the orphaned children of Muslims those whose parents have died and who are impoverished and the needy those Muslims in need and the traveller the Muslim who may be cut off from all resources on a remote journey in other words they these spoils are the due of the Prophet s and those of the four categories divided up in the way that he used to where each category received a fifth of the fifth with the rest being his the Prophet’s so that these the spoils — this being the justification for the division of these spoils in this way do not kay-lā kay functions like lā with a following implied an sc. an-lā become a thing circulating handed round between the rich among you. And whatever the Messenger gives you of spoils or otherwise take it; and whatever he forbids you abstain from it. And fear God. Surely God is severe in retribution.
لِلْفُقَرَآءِ الْمُهَاجِرِينَ الَّذِينَ أُخْرِجُواْ مِن دِيَارِهِمْ وَأَمْوَالِهِمْ يَبْتَغُونَ فَضْلاً مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَرِضْوَاناً وَيَنصُرُونَ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلصَّادِقُونَ,At the poor Emigrants li’l-fuqarā’i is semantically connected to an omitted verb that is to say a-‘ajibū ‘What! Do they marvel at the poor Emigrants’ who have been driven away from their homes and their possessions that they should seek bounty from God and beatitude and help God and His Messenger? Those — they are the sincere in their faith.
وَٱلَّذِينَ تَبَوَّءُوا ٱلدَّارَ وَٱلإِيمَانَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ يُحِبُّونَ مَنْ هَاجَرَ إِلَيْهِمْ وَلاَ يَجِدُونَ فِي صُدُورِهِمْ حَاجَةً مِّمَّآ أُوتُواْ وَيُؤْثِرُونَ عَلَىٰ أَنفُسِهِمْ وَلَوْ كَانَ بِهِمْ خَصَاصَةٌ وَمَن يُوقَ شُحَّ نَفْسِهِ فَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْمُفْلِحُونَ,And those who had settled in the hometown that is Medina and had abided in faith that is to say those who had embraced it with enthusiasm — these being the Helpers before them love those who have emigrated to them and do not find in their breasts any need any envy of that which those others have been given that is to say of what the Prophet s had given the Emigrants from the seized possessions of the Banū al-Nadīr a share which was exclusively theirs; but prefer others to themselves though they be in poverty in need of that which they prefer for those others to have. And whoever is saved from the avarice of his own soul its covetousness for acquiring possessions those — they are the successful.
وَٱلَّذِينَ جَآءُوا مِن بَعْدِهِمْ يَقُولُونَ رَبَّنَا ٱغْفِرْ لَنَا وَلإِخْوَانِنَا ٱلَّذِينَ سَبَقُونَا بِٱلإِيمَانِ وَلاَ تَجْعَلْ فِي قُلُوبِنَا غِلاًّ لِّلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ رَبَّنَآ إِنَّكَ رَءُوفٌ رَّحِيمٌ,And those who will come after them after the Emigrants and the Helpers up to the Day of Resurrection say ‘Our Lord forgive us and our brethren who preceded us in embracing the faith and do not place any rancour any spite in our hearts toward those who believe. Our Lord You are indeed Kind Merciful!’.
أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى ٱلَّذِينَ نَافَقُواْ يَقُولُونَ لإِخْوَانِهِمُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِنْ أَهْلِ ٱلْكِتَابِ لَئِنْ أُخْرِجْتُمْ لَنَخْرُجَنَّ مَعَكُمْ وَلاَ نُطِيعُ فيكُمْ أَحَداً أَبَداً وَإِن قُوتِلْتُمْ لَنَنصُرَنَّكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ يَشْهَدُ إِنَّهُمْ لَكَاذِبُونَ,Have you not considered have you not seen the hypocrites who say to their brethren who disbelieve from among the People of the Scripture namely the Banū al-Nadīr their brethren in disbelief ‘If la-in the lām is for oaths in all four instances you are expelled from Medina we will assuredly go forth with you and we will never obey anyone against you to forsake you. And if you are fought against wa-in qūtiltum the prefatory lām of la-in has been omitted we will certainly help you’. And God bears witness that they are truly liars.
لَئِنْ أُخْرِجُواْ لاَ يَخْرُجُونَ مَعَهُمْ وَلَئِن قُوتِلُواْ لاَ يَنصُرُونَهُمْ وَلَئِن نَّصَرُوهُمْ لَيُوَلُّنَّ ٱلأَدْبَارَ ثُمَّ لاَ يُنصَرُونَ,For indeed if they are expelled they would not go forth with them and if they are fought against they would not help them. And even if they were to help them that is to say even if they came to help them they would surely turn their backs to flee the implied response to the oath suffices in place of the response to the conditional in all five instances — then they the Jews would not be helped.
لأَنتُمْ أَشَدُّ رَهْبَةً فِي صُدُورِهِمْ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ ذَلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ قَوْمٌ لاَّ يَفْقَهُونَ,You indeed arouse greater awe fear in their hearts that is the hearts of the hypocrites than God — but only because He has deferred His chastisement to the Hereafter. That is because they are a people who do not comprehend.
لاَ يُقَاتِلُونَكُمْ جَمِيعاً إِلاَّ فِي قُرًى مُّحَصَّنَةٍ أَوْ مِن وَرَآءِ جُدُرٍ بَأْسُهُمْ بَيْنَهُمْ شَدِيدٌ تَحْسَبُهُمْ جَمِيعاً وَقُلُوبُهُمْ شَتَّىٰ ذَلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ قَوْمٌ لاَّ يَعْقِلُونَ,They that is the Jews will not fight against you together all in a single body except in fortified towns or from behind some wall jidār a variant reading has plural judur ‘walls’ some kind of protective fence. Their might their belligerence is great among themselves. You would suppose them to be all together united as a single body but their hearts are disunited scattered contrary to supposition. That is because they are a people who have no sense;
كَمَثَلِ ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ قَرِيباً ذَاقُواْ وَبَالَ أَمْرِهِمْ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,their likeness in relinquishing faith is as the likeness of those who recently before them a short time before — these being the idolaters from among those who fought at Badr — tasted the evil consequences of their conduct the punishment for it in this world by being killed or otherwise. And for them there will be a painful chastisement in the Hereafter.
كَمَثَلِ ٱلشَّيْطَانِ إِذْ قَالَ لِلإِنسَانِ ٱكْفُرْ فَلَمَّا كَفَرَ قَالَ إِنِّي بَرِيۤءٌ مِّنكَ إِنِّيۤ أَخَافُ ٱللَّهَ رَبَّ ٱلْعَالَمِينَ,In addition their likeness in heeding the words of the hypocrites and their forsaking of them is like Satan when he says to man ‘Disbelieve!’; so that when he man disbelieves he says ‘Lo! I am absolved of you. Indeed I fear God the Lord of the Worlds’ out of mendacity and dissimulation on his part.
فَكَانَ عَاقِبَتَهُمَآ أَنَّهُمَا فِي ٱلنَّارِ خَالِدَيْنِ فِيهَا وَذَلِكَ جَزَآءُ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ,So the sequel for both will be that is the sequel for both the one who leads astray and the one led astray a variant reading for ‘āqibatahumā has the nominative ‘āqibatuhumā as the subject of kāna ‘will be’ that they are in the Fire therein abiding. And that is the requital of the evildoers that is the disbelievers.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ ٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَلْتَنظُرْ نَفْسٌ مَّا قَدَّمَتْ لِغَدٍ وَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ خَبِيرٌ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ,O you who believe fear God and let every soul consider what it has sent ahead for tomorrow for the Day of Resurrection. And fear God. God is indeed Aware of what you do.
وَلاَ تَكُونُواْ كَٱلَّذِينَ نَسُواْ ٱللَّهَ فَأَنسَاهُمْ أَنفُسَهُمْ أُولَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْفَاسِقُونَ,And do not be like those who forget God those who neglect obedience to Him so that He makes them forget their own souls to forget to send ahead good deeds for its sake. Those — they are the immoral.
لاَ يَسْتَوِيۤ أَصْحَابُ ٱلنَّارِ وَأَصْحَابُ ٱلْجَنَّةِ أَصْحَابُ ٱلْجَنَّةِ هُمُ ٱلْفَآئِزُونَ,Not equal are the inhabitants of the Fire and the inhabitants of Paradise. It is the inhabitants of Paradise who are the winners.
لَوْ أَنزَلْنَا هَـٰذَا ٱلْقُرْآنَ عَلَىٰ جَبَلٍ لَّرَأَيْتَهُ خَاشِعاً مُّتَصَدِّعاً مِّنْ خَشْيَةِ ٱللَّهِ وَتِلْكَ ٱلأَمْثَالُ نَضْرِبُهَا لِلنَّاسِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَفَكَّرُونَ,Had We sent down this Qur’ān upon a mountain and had it the mountain been endowed with a faculty of discernment like man you would have surely seen it humbled rent asunder by the fear of God. And such similitudes as those mentioned — do We strike for mankind that perhaps they may reflect and so become believers.
هُوَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِي لاَ إِلَـٰهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ عَالِمُ ٱلْغَيْبِ وَٱلشَّهَادَةِ هُوَ ٱلرَّحْمَـٰنُ ٱلرَّحِيمُ,He is God than Whom there is no other god Knower of the unseen and the visible what is secret and what is proclaimed — He is the Compassionate the Merciful.
هُوَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِي لاَ إِلَـٰهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ ٱلْمَلِكُ ٱلْقُدُّوسُ ٱلسَّلاَمُ ٱلْمُؤْمِنُ ٱلْمُهَيْمِنُ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْجَبَّارُ ٱلْمُتَكَبِّرُ سُبْحَانَ ٱللَّهِ عَمَّا يُشْرِكُونَ,He is God than Whom there is no other god the King the Holy the One sanctified from what does not befit Him the Peace unblemished by any defects the Securer the One Who confirms the sincerity of His messengers by creating miracles for them the Guardian al-muhaymin derives from haymana yuhayminu meaning that one is watcher over something in other words the One Who is Witness to the deeds of His servants the Mighty the Strong the Compeller compelling His creatures to what He will the Exalted above what does not befit Him. Glorified be God — He is declaring His transcendence — above what partners they ascribe! to Him.
هُوَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْخَالِقُ ٱلْبَارِىءُ ٱلْمُصَوِّرُ لَهُ ٱلأَسْمَآءُ ٱلْحُسْنَىٰ يُسَبِّحُ لَهُ مَا فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَهُوَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ,He is God the Creator the Maker the Originator from nothing the Shaper. To Him belong the ninety nine Most Beautiful Names cited in hadīth al-husnā is the feminine of al-ahsan. All that is in the heavens and the earth glorify Him and He is the Mighty the Wise — already explained at the beginning of this sūra.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ لاَ تَتَّخِذُواْ عَدُوِّي وَعَدُوَّكُمْ أَوْلِيَآءَ تُلْقُونَ إِلَيْهِمْ بِٱلْمَوَدَّةِ وَقَدْ كَفَرُواْ بِمَا جَآءَكُمْ مِّنَ ٱلْحَقِّ يُخْرِجُونَ ٱلرَّسُولَ وَإِيَّاكُمْ أَن تُؤْمِنُواْ بِٱللَّهِ رَبِّكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ خَرَجْتُمْ جِهَاداً فِي سَبِيلِي وَٱبْتِغَآءَ مَرْضَاتِي تُسِرُّونَ إِلَيْهِمْ بِٱلْمَوَدَّةِ وَأَنَاْ أَعْلَمُ بِمَآ أَخْفَيْتُمْ وَمَآ أَعْلَنتُمْ وَمَن يَفْعَلْهُ مِنكُمْ فَقَدْ ضَلَّ سَوَآءَ ٱلسَّبِيلِ,O you who believe do not take My enemy and your enemy namely the disbelievers of Mecca for friends. You offer you communicate to them the Prophet’s plan s to attack them which he had confided to you and had kept secret at Hunayn communicating this to them out of affection between you and them. Hātib b. Abī Balta‘a sent them a letter to that effect on account of his having children and close relatives idolaters among them. The Prophet s intercepted it from the person to whom he Hātib had given it to deliver after God apprised him of this. Hātib’s excuse for this conduct of his was accepted by the Prophet; when verily they have disbelieved in the truth that has come to you that is in the religion of Islam and the Qur’ān expelling the Messenger and you from Mecca by oppressing you because you believe in God your Lord. If you have gone forth to struggle in My way and to seek My pleasure … the response to the conditional is indicated by what preceded that is to say understand it as being ‘then do not take them as friends’. You secretly harbour affection for them when I know well what you hide and what you proclaim. And whoever among you does that that is to secretly communicate the Prophet’s news to them has verily strayed from the right way he has missed the path of guidance originally al-sawā’ means ‘the middle way’.
إِن يَثْقَفُوكُمْ يَكُونُواْ لَكُمْ أَعْدَآءً وَيَبْسُطُوۤاْ إِلَيْكُمْ أَيْدِيَهُمْ وَأَلْسِنَتَهُمْ بِٱلسُّوۤءِ وَوَدُّواْ لَوْ تَكْفُرُونَ,If they were to prevail over you they would be your enemies and would stretch out against you their hands to kill and assault you and their tongues with evil intent with insults and reviling; and they long for you to disbelieve.
لَن تَنفَعَكُمْ أَرْحَامُكُمْ وَلاَ أَوْلاَدُكُمْ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ يَفْصِلُ بَيْنَكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ,Your relatives and your children the idolatrous ones for whose sake you secretly communicated the news will not avail you against the chastisement in the Hereafter. On the Day of Resurrection you will be separated passive yufsalu; or read active yafsilu ‘He will separate you’ from them so that you will be in Paradise while they will be alongside the disbelievers in the Fire. And God is Seer of what you do.
قَدْ كَانَتْ لَكُمْ أُسْوَةٌ حَسَنَةٌ فِيۤ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَٱلَّذِينَ مَعَهُ إِذْ قَالُواْ لِقَوْمِهِمْ إِنَّا بُرَءآؤُاْ مِّنْكُمْ وَمِمَّا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ كَفَرْنَا بِكُمْ وَبَدَا بَيْنَنَا وَبَيْنَكُمُ ٱلْعَدَاوَةُ وَٱلْبَغْضَآءُ أَبَداً حَتَّىٰ تُؤْمِنُواْ بِٱللَّهِ وَحْدَهُ إِلاَّ قَوْلَ إِبْرَاهِيمَ لأَبِيهِ لأَسْتَغْفِرَنَّ لَكَ وَمَآ أَمْلِكُ لَكَ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ مِن شَيْءٍ رَّبَّنَا عَلَيْكَ تَوَكَّلْنَا وَإِلَيْكَ أَنَبْنَا وَإِلَيْكَ ٱلْمَصِيرُ,Verily there is for you a good example read iswa or uswa in both instances meaning qudwa in the person of Abraham in terms of his sayings and deeds and those who were with him of believers when they said to their people ‘We are indeed innocent of you bura’ā’ is the plural of barī’ similar in form to zarīf ‘charming’ and of what you worship besides God. We repudiate you we disavow you and between us and you there has arisen enmity and hate forever wa’l-baghdā’u abadan pronounce both hamzas fully or replace the second one with a wāw until you come to believe in God alone’ except for Abraham’s saying to his father ‘I shall ask forgiveness for you — this statement is excepted from ‘a good example’ so it is not right for you to follow his example in this respect by asking forgiveness for disbelievers. As for his saying but I cannot avail you anything against God’ — that is either against His chastisement or to secure for you of His reward — he Abraham is using it to intimate to his father that he can do nothing for him other than to ask forgiveness for him which saying is itself based on that former statement albeit excepted from it in terms of what is meant by it even if on the face of it it would seem to be semantically part of the good example to be followed Say ‘Who can avail you anything against God’ Q. 4811; his Abraham’s plea of forgiveness for him was before it became evident to him that he his father was an enemy of God as mentioned in sūrat Barā’a Q. 9114. ‘Our Lord in You we put our trust and to You we turn penitently and to You is the journeying these are the words of the Friend of God Abraham and those who were with him in other words they were saying
رَبَّنَا لاَ تَجْعَلْنَا فِتْنَةً لِّلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَٱغْفِرْ لَنَا رَبَّنَآ إِنَّكَ أَنتَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ,Our Lord do not make us a cause of beguilement for those who disbelieve that is to say do not make them prevail over us lest they think that they are following the truth and are beguiled as a result in other words lest they lose their reason because of us; and forgive us. Our Lord You are indeed the Mighty the Wise’ in Your kingdom and Your actions.
لَقَدْ كَانَ لَكُمْ فِيهِمْ أُسْوَةٌ حَسَنَةٌ لِّمَن كَانَ يَرْجُو ٱللَّهَ وَٱلْيَوْمَ ٱلآخِرَ وَمَن يَتَوَلَّ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ هُوَ ٱلْغَنِيُّ ٱلْحَمِيدُ,Verily there is for you O community of Muhammad (s) laqad kāna lakum is the response to an implied oath in them a good example for those of you who li-man kāna is an inclusive substitution for –kum of lakum ‘for you’ with the same preposition li- repeated anticipate God and the Last Day that is for those who fear these two or who expect reward or punishment. And whoever turns away by befriending the disbelievers should know that God is the Independent without need of His creatures the Worthy of Praise to those who obey Him.
عَسَى ٱللَّهُ أَن يَجْعَلَ بَيْنَكُمْ وَبَيْنَ ٱلَّذِينَ عَادَيْتُم مِّنْهُم مَّوَدَّةً وَٱللَّهُ قَدِيرٌ وَٱللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,It may be that God will bring about between you and those of them with whom you are at enmity from among the disbelievers of Mecca out of your obedience to God exalted be He affection by His guiding them to faith so that they then become your friends. For God is Powerful able to do that — and He did do this after the conquest of Mecca — and God is Forgiving to them of their past deeds Merciful to them also.
لاَّ يَنْهَاكُمُ ٱللَّهُ عَنِ ٱلَّذِينَ لَمْ يُقَاتِلُوكُمْ فِي ٱلدِّينِ وَلَمْ يُخْرِجُوكُمْ مِّن دِيَارِكُمْ أَن تَبَرُّوهُمْ وَتُقْسِطُوۤاْ إِلَيْهِمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُحِبُّ ٱلْمُقْسِطِينَ,God does not forbid you in regard to those who did not wage war against you from among the disbelievers on account of religion and did not expel you from your homes that you should treat them kindly an tabarrūhum is an inclusive substitution for alladhīna ‘those who’ and deal with them justly this was revealed before the command to struggle against them. Assuredly God loves the just.
إِنَّمَا يَنْهَاكُمُ ٱللَّهُ عَنِ ٱلَّذِينَ قَاتَلُوكُمْ فِي ٱلدِّينِ وَأَخْرَجُوكُم مِّن دِيَارِكُمْ وَظَاهَرُواْ عَلَىٰ إِخْرَاجِكُمْ أَن تَوَلَّوْهُمْ وَمَن يَتَوَلَّهُمْ فَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلظَّالِمُونَ,God only forbids you in regard to those who waged war against you on account of religion and expelled you from your homes and supported others in your expulsion that you should make friends with them an tawallawhum is an inclusive substitution for alladhīna ‘those who’. And whoever makes friends with them those — they are the wrongdoers.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ إِذَا جَآءَكُمُ ٱلْمُؤْمِنَاتُ مُهَاجِرَاتٍ فَٱمْتَحِنُوهُنَّ ٱللَّهُ أَعْلَمُ بِإِيمَانِهِنَّ فَإِنْ عَلِمْتُمُوهُنَّ مُؤْمِنَاتٍ فَلاَ تَرْجِعُوهُنَّ إِلَى ٱلْكُفَّارِ لاَ هُنَّ حِلٌّ لَّهُمْ وَلاَ هُمْ يَحِلُّونَ لَهُنَّ وَآتُوهُم مَّآ أَنفَقُواْ وَلاَ جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ أَن تَنكِحُوهُنَّ إِذَآ آتَيْتُمُوهُنَّ أُجُورَهُنَّ وَلاَ تُمْسِكُواْ بِعِصَمِ ٱلْكَوَافِرِ وَاسْأَلُواْ مَآ أَنفَقْتُمْ وَلْيَسْأَلُواْ مَآ أَنفَقُواْ ذَلِكُمْ حُكْمُ ٱللَّهِ يَحْكُمُ بَيْنَكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ حَكِيمٌ,O you who believe when believing women come to you saying with their tongues that they are emigrating from the company of disbelievers — this was following the truce concluded with them the disbelievers at al-Hudaybiyya to the effect that if any of their number should go to join the believers that person should be sent back — test them by making them swear that they had only gone forth from Mecca because of their sincere wish to embrace Islam and not out of some hatred for their disbelieving husbands nor because they might be enamoured by some Muslim man that was how the Prophet s used to take from them their oaths. God knows best the state of their faith. Then if you know them if you suppose them on the basis of their oaths to be believers do not send them back to the disbelievers. They the women are not lawful for them nor are they the disbelievers lawful for them. And give them that is to say their disbelieving husbands what they have expended on them on such women in the way of dowries. And you would not be at fault if you marry them on that previous condition when you have given them their dowries. And do not hold on read tumassikū or tumsikū to the conjugal ties of disbelieving women your wives for your Islam automatically prohibits you from this or to the ties of those apostatising women who return to the idolaters for likewise their apostatising automatically prohibits you from marrying them and ask for demand the return of what you have expended on these women of dowries in the event of apostasy from those disbelievers to whom they are married. And let them ask for what they have expended on those women who have emigrated as explained above that it may be repaid to them. That is God’s judgement. He judges between you therewith and God is Knower Wise.
وَإِن فَاتَكُمْ شَيْءٌ مِّنْ أَزْوَاجِكُمْ إِلَى ٱلْكُفَّارِ فَعَاقَبْتُمْ فَآتُواْ ٱلَّذِينَ ذَهَبَتْ أَزْوَاجُهُمْ مِّثْلَ مَآ أَنفَقُواْ وَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ ٱلَّذِيۤ أَنتُمْ بِهِ مُؤْمِنُونَ,And if you lose any of your wives that is to say if you lose one or more of them — or it means if you lose anything of their dowries — by their going to the disbelievers as apostates and so you retaliate you embark upon a raid and capture spoils from them then give those whose wives have gone from the spoils the like of what they have expended for their having lost it to the disbelievers. And fear God in Whom you believe. And indeed the believers did what they had been commanded to do in the way of paying back the disbelievers the dowries of their former wives and the believers the dowries of the women who had apostatised. Afterwards however this stipulation was annulled.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّبِيُّ إِذَا جَآءَكَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنَاتُ يُبَايِعْنَكَ عَلَىٰ أَن لاَّ يُشْرِكْنَ بِٱللَّهِ شَيْئاً وَلاَ يَسْرِقْنَ وَلاَ يَزْنِينَ وَلاَ يَقْتُلْنَ أَوْلاَدَهُنَّ وَلاَ يَأْتِينَ بِبُهْتَٰنٍ يَفْتَرِينَهُ بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِنَّ وَأَرْجُلِهِنَّ وَلاَ يَعْصِينَكَ فِي مَعْرُوفٍ فَبَايِعْهُنَّ وَٱسْتَغْفِرْ لَهُنَّ ٱللَّهَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,O Prophet if believing women come to you pledging allegiance to you that they will not ascribe anything as partner to God and that they will not steal nor commit adultery nor slay their children as used to be done during the time of pagandom jāhiliyya when they would bury new-born girls alive fearing ignominy and impoverishment nor bring any lie that they have invented originating between their hands and their legs that is by bringing a foundling which they then falsely ascribe to the husband — it the lie is described in terms of a real child because when a woman gives birth to a child it falls between her hands and legs; nor disobey you in doing what is decent which is that which concords with obedience to God such as refraining from wailing ripping apart their clothes in grief pulling out their hair tearing open the front of their garments or scratching their faces then accept their allegiance — the Prophet s did this but in words and he did not shake hands with any of them — and ask God to forgive them; surely God is Forgiving Merciful.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ لاَ تَتَوَلَّوْاْ قوْماً غَضِبَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْهِمْ قَدْ يَئِسُواْ مِنَ ٱلآخِرَةِ كَمَا يَئِسَ ٱلْكُفَّارُ مِنْ أَصْحَابِ ٱلْقُبُورِ,O you who believe do not befriend a people against whom God is wrathful namely the Jews. They have truly despaired of the Hereafter of attaining its reward — despite their being certain of its truth out of obstinacy towards the Prophet even though they know him to be sincere — just as the disbelievers have despaired — they themselves being — of those who are in the tombs that is to say those who are entombed and barred from the good of the Hereafter for they are shown both their would-have-been places in Paradise had they believed and the Fire for which they are destined.
سَبَّحَ لِلَّهِ مَا فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَهُوَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ,All that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth glorifies God that is to say everything proclaims His transcendence the lām of li’Llāhi is extra and mā has been used instead of min in order to indicate the predominance of non-rational creatures and He is the Mighty in His kingdom the Wise in His actions.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ لِمَ تَقُولُونَ مَا لاَ تَفْعَلُونَ,O you who believe why do you say in demanding to participate in the struggle what you do not do? for you retreated at Uhud.
كَبُرَ مَقْتاً عِندَ ٱللَّهِ أَن تَقُولُواْ مَا لاَ تَفْعَلُونَ,It is greatly loathsome maqtan is for specification to God that you say an taqūlū constitutes the agent of the verb kabura ‘it is greatly’ what you do not do.
إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُحِبُّ ٱلَّذِينَ يُقَاتِلُونَ فِي سَبِيلِهِ صَفّاً كَأَنَّهُم بُنْيَانٌ مَّرْصُوصٌ,Indeed God loves He assists and honours those who fight for His cause in ranks saffan is a circumstantial qualifier in other words understand it as sāffīna as if they were a solid structure with all of its parts compacted together firm.
وَإِذْ قَالَ مُوسَىٰ لِقَوْمِهِ يٰقَوْمِ لِمَ تُؤْذُونَنِي وَقَد تَّعْلَمُونَ أَنِّي رَسُولُ ٱللَّهِ إِلَيْكُمْ فَلَمَّا زَاغُوۤاْ أَزَاغَ ٱللَّهُ قُلُوبَهُمْ وَٱللَّهُ لاَ يَهْدِي ٱلْقَوْمَ ٱلْفَاسِقِينَ,And mention when Moses said to his people ‘O my people why do you harm me — for they had said that he had a hernia in his testicles which he did not have and they denied him — when certainly qad is for confirmation you know that I am the messenger of God to you?’ annī rasūlu’Llāhi ilaykum this sentence is a circumstantial qualifier and when you know that messengers ought to be respected. So when they deviated when they swerved away from the truth by harming him God caused their hearts to deviate He turned them away from guidance in accordance to what He had preordained since pre-eternity and God does not guide the immoral folk those who in His knowledge are disbelievers.
وَإِذْ قَالَ عِيسَى ٱبْنُ مَرْيَمَ يٰبَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ إِنِّي رَسُولُ ٱللَّهِ إِلَيْكُم مُّصَدِّقاً لِّمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيَّ مِنَ ٱلتَّوْرَاةِ وَمُبَشِّراً بِرَسُولٍ يَأْتِي مِن بَعْدِي ٱسْمُهُ أَحْمَدُ فَلَمَّا جَاءَهُم بِٱلْبَيِّنَاتِ قَالُواْ هَـٰذَا سِحْرٌ مُّبِينٌ,And mention when Jesus son of Mary said ‘O Children of Israel — he did not say ‘O my people’ as did Moses because he was not related to them in any way — I am indeed God’s messenger to you confirming what is before me of the Torah and bringing good tidings of a messenger who will come after me whose name is Ahmad.’ God exalted be He says Yet when he brought them when Ahmad brought the disbelievers the clear signs the revelations and the indications they said ‘This namely what has been brought is manifest sorcery!’ sihrun a variant reading has sāhirun ‘a sorcerer’ meaning the one who has brought them is a manifest sorcerer.
وَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّنِ ٱفْتَرَىٰ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ ٱلْكَذِبَ وَهُوَ يُدْعَىٰ إِلَى ٱلإِسْلاَمِ وَٱللَّهُ لاَ يَهْدِي ٱلْقَوْمَ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ,And who does — that is to say none does — greater wrong than he who invents lies against God by ascribing a partner and a child to Him and describing His signs as being sorcery when he is actually being summoned to submission to God? And God does not guide the wrongdoing folk the disbelieving folk.
يُرِيدُونَ لِيُطْفِئُواْ نُورَ ٱللَّهِ بِأَفْوَٰهِهِمْ وَٱللَّهُ مُتِمُّ نُورِهِ وَلَوْ كَرِهَ ٱلْكَٰفِرُونَ,They desire to extinguish li-yutfi’ū is in the subjunctive form because of an implicit an sc. an yutfi’ū the lām being extra the light of God His Law and His proofs with their mouths with their sayings that this is sorcery or poetry or soothsaying; but God will perfect He will manifest His light mutimmun nūrahu some have read this in the form of a genitive annextation mutimmu nūrihi though the disbelievers be averse to this.
هُوَ ٱلَّذِيۤ أَرْسَلَ رَسُولَهُ بِٱلْهُدَىٰ وَدِينِ ٱلْحَقِّ لِيُظْهِرَهُ عَلَى ٱلدِّينِ كُلِّهِ وَلَوْ كَرِهَ ٱلْمُشْرِكُونَ,It is He Who has sent His Messenger with the guidance and the religion of truth that He may make it prevail that He may raise it over all other religions over all the religions which oppose it though the disbelievers be averse to this.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ هَلْ أَدُلُّكمْ عَلَىٰ تِجَارَةٍ تُنجِيكُم مِّنْ عَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ,O you who believe shall I show you a commerce that will deliver you read tunjīkum or tunajjīkum from a painful chastisement? It is as if they had replied ‘Yes’ so that He then says
تُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ وَتُجَاهِدُونَ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ بِأَمْوَالِكُمْ وَأَنفُسِكُمْ ذَلِكُمْ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ,You should believe you should maintain faith in God and His Messenger and struggle for the cause of God with your possessions and your lives. That is better for you should you know that it is better for you then do it.
يَغْفِرْ لَكُمْ ذُنُوبَكُمْ وَيُدْخِلْكُمْ جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلأَنْهَارُ وَمَسَاكِنَ طَيِّبَةً فِي جَنَّاتِ عَدْنٍ ذَلِكَ ٱلْفَوْزُ ٱلْعَظِيمُ,He will then forgive you yaghfir is the response to an implied conditional that is to say ‘if you do this He will then forgive you’ your sins and admit you into gardens underneath which rivers flow and pleasant dwellings in the Gardens of Eden as a residence. That is the supreme triumph.
وَأُخْرَىٰ تُحِبُّونَهَا نَصْرٌ مِّن ٱللَّهِ وَفَتْحٌ قَرِيبٌ وَبَشِّرِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ,And He will give you another grace which you love help from God and a victory near at hand. And give good tidings to the believers of assistance and victory.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ كُونُوۤاْ أَنصَارَ ٱللَّهِ كَمَا قَالَ عِيسَى ٱبْنُ مَرْيَمَ لِلْحَوَارِيِّينَ مَنْ أَنَّصَارِيۤ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ قَالَ ٱلْحَوَارِيُّونَ نَحْنُ أَنصَارُ ٱللَّهِ فَآمَنَت طَّآئِفَةٌ مِّن بَنِيۤ إِسْرَائِيلَ وَكَفَرَت طَّآئِفَةٌ فَأَيَّدْنَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ عَلَىٰ عَدُوِّهِمْ فَأَصْبَحُواْ ظَاهِرِينَ,O you who believe be helpers of God of His religion a variant reading of ansāran li’Llāhi has the genitive annexation ansāra’Llāhi just as said kamā qāla to the end of the statement means ‘just as the disciples were so’ as is indicated by what follows Jesus son of Mary to the disciples ‘Who will be my helpers unto God?’ that is to say who of you will be helpers alongside me turning to help God? The disciples said ‘We will be God’s helpers!’ These al-hawāriyyūn were the intimates of Jesus for they were the first to believe in him. They were twelve men of pure white complexion hawar; but it is also said that their epithet derives from the fact that they were bleachers qassārūn who bleached yuhawwirūna clothes. So a group of the Children of Israel believed in Jesus saying ‘He is indeed the servant of God who has been raised to heaven’ while a group disbelieved because they said that he was the son of God whom He had raised unto Himself. Thus the two groups waged war against one another. Then We strengthened those who believed of the two groups against their enemy the disbelieving groups and so they became the triumphant the victors.
يُسَبِّحُ لِلَّهِ مَا فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِي ٱلأَرْضِ ٱلْمَلِكِ ٱلْقُدُّوسِ ٱلْعَزِيزِ ٱلْحَكِيمِ,All that is the heavens and all that is in the earth glorifies God all proclaims His transcendence the lām of li’Llāhi is extra; mā is used instead of min in order to indicate the predominance of non-rational beings the King the Holy the One Who transcends what does not befit Him the Mighty the Wise in His kingdom and in His actions.
هُوَ ٱلَّذِي بَعَثَ فِي ٱلأُمِّيِّينَ رَسُولاً مِّنْهُمْ يَتْلُواْ عَلَيْهِمْ آيَاتِهِ وَيُزَكِّيهِمْ وَيُعَلِّمُهُمُ ٱلْكِتَابَ وَٱلْحِكْمَةَ وَإِن كَانُواْ مِن قَبْلُ لَفِي ضَلاَلٍ مُّبِينٍ,It is He Who sent to the unlettered folk among the Arabs ummī means ‘one who cannot write or read a book’ a messenger from among them namely Muhammad (s) to recite to them His signs the Qur’ān and to purify them to cleanse them from idolatry and to teach them the Book the Qur’ān and wisdom in the rulings that it contains though indeed wa-in in has been softened from the hardened form with its subject having been omitted that is to say understand it as wa-innahum before that before his coming they had been in manifest error.
وَآخَرِينَ مِنْهُمْ لَمَّا يَلْحَقُواْ بِهِمْ وَهُوَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ,And to others wa-ākharīna is a supplement to al-ummiyyīna ‘the unlettered’ that is to say those who are alive from among them and to those of them who will come after them who have not yet joined them with regard to precedence and merit; and He is the Mighty the Wise in His kingdom and in His actions those mentioned as coming afterwards are the Successors al-tābi‘ūna; and it suffices to mention these Successors in order to illustrate the greater merit of the Companions among whom the Prophet s was sent over all those others of humans and jinn to whom he was also sent and who believed and will believe in him up until the Day of Resurrection for every generation is better than the succeeding one.
ذَلِكَ فَضْلُ ٱللَّهِ يُؤْتِيهِ مَن يَشَآءُ وَٱللَّهُ ذُو ٱلْفَضْلِ ٱلْعَظِيمِ,That is the bounty of God which He gives to whom He will — such as the Prophet and those mentioned with him — and God is dispenser of tremendous bounty.
مَثَلُ ٱلَّذِينَ حُمِّلُواْ ٱلتَّوْرَاةَ ثُمَّ لَمْ يَحْمِلُوهَا كَمَثَلِ ٱلْحِمَارِ يَحْمِلُ أَسْفَاراً بِئْسَ مَثَلُ ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلَّذِينَ كَذَّبُواْ بِآيَاتِ ٱللَّهِ وَٱللَّهُ لاَ يَهْدِي ٱلْقَوْمَ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ,The likeness of those who were entrusted with the Torah those who were charged with implementing it then failed to uphold it then failed to act in accordance with it in what pertains to the descriptions of the Prophet s and so did not believe in him is as the likeness of an ass carrying books in that it does not benefit from them. Evil is the likeness of the people who deny God’s signs those confirming the truth of the Prophet s — the object of rebuke is omitted but is implied to be hādhā’l-mathalu ‘this likeness’. And God does not guide the evildoing folk the disbelievers.
قُلْ يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ هَادُوۤاْ إِن زَعمْتُمْ أَنَّكُمْ أَوْلِيَآءُ لِلَّهِ مِن دُونِ ٱلنَّاسِ فَتَمَنَّوُاْ ٱلْمَوْتَ إِن كُنتُمْ صَادِقِينَ,Say ‘O you of Jewry if you claim that you are the favoured friends of God to the exclusion of other people then long for death if you are truthful’ in kuntum sādiqīna is semantically connected to tamannū ‘long for’; as for the two conditions the first is dependent on the second that is to say if you are truthful in your claim that you are the favoured friends of God and given that such a friend would prefer the Hereafter to this world and that it the Hereafter begins at death then long for it.
وَلاَ يَتَمَنَّونَهُ أَبَداً بِمَا قَدَّمَتْ أَيْديهِمْ وَٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ بِٱلظَّالِمِينَ,But they will never long for it because of what their hands have sent ahead in the way of their disbelief of the Prophet which itself is a necessary consequence of their denial; and God is Knower of the evildoers the disbelievers.
قُلْ إِنَّ ٱلْمَوْتَ ٱلَّذِي تَفِرُّونَ مِنْهُ فَإِنَّهُ مُلاَقِيكُمْ ثُمَّ تُرَدُّونَ إِلَىٰ عَالِمِ ٱلْغَيْبِ وَٱلشَّهَادَةِ فَيُنَبِّئُكُم بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ,Say ‘Assuredly the death from which you flee fa-innahu the fā’ is extra will indeed encounter you; then you will be returned to the Knower of the Unseen and the visible the Knower of what is kept secret and what is in the open and He will inform you of what you used to do’ whereat He will requite you for it.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُوۤاْ إِذَا نُودِيَ لِلصَّلاَةِ مِن يَوْمِ ٱلْجُمُعَةِ فَٱسْعَوْاْ إِلَىٰ ذِكْرِ ٱللَّهِ وَذَرُواْ ٱلْبَيْعَ ذَلِكُمْ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ,O you who believe when the call for prayer is made on Friday hasten set off to the remembrance of God to the prayer and leave aside all commerce suspend all such contracts. That is better for you should you know that it is better for you then do it.
فَإِذَا قُضِيَتِ ٱلصَّلاَةُ فَٱنتَشِرُواْ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَٱبْتَغُواْ مِن فَضْلِ ٱللَّهِ وَٱذْكُرُواْ ٱللَّهَ كَثِيراً لَّعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ,And when the prayer is finished disperse in the land this is an imperative denoting permissibility and seek provision through God’s bounty and remember God with remembrance frequently that perhaps you may be successful that perhaps you may be the winners.
وَإِذَا رَأَوْاْ تِجَارَةً أَوْ لَهْواً ٱنفَضُّوۤاْ إِلَيْهَا وَتَرَكُوكَ قَآئِماً قُلْ مَا عِندَ ٱللَّهِ خَيْرٌ مِّنَ ٱللَّهْوِ وَمِنَ ٱلتِّجَارَةِ وَٱللَّهُ خَيْرُ ٱلرَّازِقِينَ,On one occasion the Prophet s was delivering the Friday sermon when a caravan arrived and so as was the custom drums were beaten to announce its arrival whereat the people began to leave the mosque to go to it all except for twelve men. The following verse was then revealed But when they sight some opportunity for business or a diversion they scatter off towards it that is towards the business since it is what they seek more than diversion and leave you during the sermon standing. Say ‘That which is with God in the way of reward is better for those who believe than diversion and commerce. And God is the best of providers’. They say that every person ‘provides for’ yarzuqu his dependants by which they mean that such a person does so by means of the provision given by God min rizqi’Llāhi exalted be He.
إِذَا جَآءَكَ ٱلْمُنَافِقُونَ قَالُواْ نَشْهَدُ إِنَّكَ لَرَسُولُ ٱللَّهِ وَٱللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ إِنَّكَ لَرَسُولُهُ وَٱللَّهُ يَشْهَدُ إِنَّ ٱلْمُنَافِقِينَ لَكَاذِبُونَ,When the hypocrites come to you they say with their tongues in contradiction of what is in their hearts ‘We bear witness that you are indeed the Messenger of God.’ And God knows that you are indeed His Messenger and God bears witness He knows that the hypocrites truly are liars in what they conceal that which is contrary to what they say.
ٱتَّخَذُوۤاْ أَيْمَانَهُمْ جُنَّةً فَصَدُّواْ عَن سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ إِنَّهُمْ سَآءَ مَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ,They have taken their oaths as a shield as a means of protection for their possessions and their lives and so they have barred thereby from the way of God that is from using them for the struggle. Evil indeed is that which they are wont to do.
ذَلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ آمَنُواّ ثُمَّ كَفَرُوا فَطُبِعَ عَلَىٰ قُلُوبِهِمْ فَهُمْ لاَ يَفْقَهُونَ,That namely their evil deed is because they believed by affirming faith only with the tongue then disbelieved in their hearts that is to say they persist in harbouring disbelief in it; therefore their hearts have been stamped sealed with disbelief. Hence they do not understand faith.
وَإِذَا رَأَيْتَهُمْ تُعْجِبُكَ أَجْسَامُهُمْ وَإِن يَقُولُواْ تَسْمَعْ لِقَوْلِهِمْ كَأَنَّهُمْ خُشُبٌ مُّسَنَّدَةٌ يَحْسَبُونَ كُلَّ صَيْحَةٍ عَلَيْهِمْ هُمُ ٱلْعَدُوُّ فَٱحْذَرْهُمْ قَاتَلَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ أَنَّى يُؤْفَكُونَ,And when you see them their figures please you on account of their fairness; and if they speak you listen to their speech because of its eloquence. Yet they are by virtue of the enormous size of their figures yet in their lack of comprehension like blocks of timber read khushbun or khushubun that have been propped-up set reclining against a wall. They assume that every cry made like a battle-cry or one made to retrieve a lost camel is directed against them because of the extent of terror in their hearts lest something should be revealed deeming their blood licit. They are the enemy so beware of them for they communicate your secrets to the disbelievers. May God assail them! destroy them! How can they deviate? how can they be turned away from faith after the proofs for it have been established?
وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمْ تَعَالَوْاْ يَسْتَغْفِرْ لَكُمْ رَسُولُ ٱللَّهِ لَوَّوْاْ رُءُوسَهُمْ وَرَأَيْتَهُمْ يَصُدُّونَ وَهُم مُّسْتَكْبِرُونَ,And when it is said to them ‘Come offer apologies and God’s Messenger will ask forgiveness for you’ they twist read lawwaw or lawū they turn their heads and you see them turning away rejecting this offer disdainful.
سَوَآءٌ عَلَيْهِمْ أَسْتَغْفَرْتَ لَهُمْ أَمْ لَمْ تَسْتَغْفِرْ لَهُمْ لَن يَغْفِرَ ٱللَّهُ لَهُمْ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لاَ يَهْدِي ٱلْقَوْمَ ٱلْفَـٰسِقِينَ,It will be the same for them whether you ask forgiveness for them a’staghfarta the interrogative hamza here has taken the place of the conjunctive hamza or do not ask forgiveness for them God will never forgive them. Indeed God does not guide the immoral folk.
هُمُ ٱلَّذِينَ يَقُولُونَ لاَ تُنفِقُواْ عَلَىٰ مَنْ عِندَ رَسُولِ ٱللَّهِ حَتَّىٰ يَنفَضُّواْ وَلِلَّهِ خَزَآئِنُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَلَـٰكِنَّ ٱلْمُنَافِقِينَ لاَ يَفْقَهُونَ,They are the ones who say to their companions from among the Helpers ‘Do not expend on those who are with the Messenger of God from among the Emigrants until they scatter off’ until they part with him. Yet to God belong the treasuries of the heavens and the earth with what they contain of provision and so He is the provider for the Emigrants and others but the hypocrites do not understand.
يَقُولُونَ لَئِن رَّجَعْنَآ إِلَى ٱلْمَدِينَةِ لَيُخْرِجَنَّ ٱلأَعَزُّ مِنْهَا ٱلأَذَلَّ وَلِلَّهِ ٱلْعِزَّةُ وَلِرَسُولِهِ وَلِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَلَـٰكِنَّ ٱلْمُنَافِقِينَ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ,They say ‘Surely if we return from the raid against the Banū al-Mustaliq to Medina the powerful by which they meant themselves will soon expel from it the weaker’ by which they meant the believers. Yet the real might victory belongs to God and to His Messenger and to the believers but the hypocrites do not know that.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ لاَ تُلْهِكُمْ أَمْوَالُكُمْ وَلاَ أَوْلاَدُكُمْ عَن ذِكْرِ ٱللَّهِ وَمَن يَفْعَلْ ذَلِكَ فَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْخَاسِرُونَ,O you who believe do not let your possessions and your children divert you distract you from the remembrance of God from the five prayers; for whoever does that — it is they who are the losers.
وَأَنفِقُواْ مِن مَّا رَزَقْنَاكُمْ مِّن قَبْلِ أَن يَأْتِيَ أَحَدَكُمُ ٱلْمَوْتُ فَيَقُولَ رَبِّ لَوْلاۤ أَخَّرْتَنِيۤ إِلَىٰ أَجَلٍ قَرِيبٍ فَأَصَّدَّقَ وَأَكُن مِّنَ ٱلصَّالِحِينَ,And expend in alms of that with which We have provided you before death comes to any of you whereat he will say ‘My Lord if only law-lā means hal-lā ‘why do You not’; or the lā is extra and the law is optative You would reprieve me for a short time so that I might give charity assaddaq the original tā’ of atasaddaqa has been assimilated with the sād that I might offer alms and become one of the righteous!’ by making the Pilgrimage. Ibn ‘Abbās may God be pleased with both him and his father said ‘Every person who has fallen short of his duty regarding alms and the Pilgrimage will ask to be returned to this world at the moment of death’.
وَلَن يُؤَخِّرَ ٱللَّهُ نَفْساً إِذَا جَآءَ أَجَلُهَآ وَٱللَّهُ خَبِيرٌ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ,But God will never reprieve a soul when its term has come. And God is Aware of what you do ta‘malūna; also read as the third person plural ya‘malūna ‘they do’.
يُسَبِّحُ لِلَّهِ مَا فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِي ٱلأَرْضِ لَهُ ٱلْمُلْكُ وَلَهُ ٱلْحَمْدُ وَهُوَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,All that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth glorifies God everything proclaims His transcendence the lām of li’Llāhi is extra; mā is used instead of min in order to indicate the predominance of non-rational beings. To Him belongs the Kingdom and to Him belongs all praise and He has power over all things.
هُوَ ٱلَّذِي خَلَقَكُمْ فَمِنكُمْ كَافِرٌ وَمِنكُمْ مُّؤْمِنٌ وَٱللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ,It is He Who created you. Then some of you are disbelievers and some of you are believers in terms of your original disposition; then He makes you die and brings you back to life in that same disposition; and God is Seer of what you do.
خَلَقَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضَ بِٱلْحَقِّ وَصَوَّرَكُمْ فَأَحْسَنَ صُوَرَكُمْ وَإِلَيْهِ ٱلْمَصِيرُ,He created the heavens and the earth with the truth and He shaped you and made your shapes excellent for He made the human form to be the best of forms; and to Him is the journey’s end.
يَعْلَمُ مَا فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلأَرْضِ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا تُسِرُّونَ وَمَا تُعْلِنُونَ وَٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ بِذَاتِ ٱلصُّدُورِ,He knows all that is in the heavens and the earth and He knows what you hide and what you disclose and God is Knower of what is in the breasts in terms of the secrets and convictions they contain.
أَلَمْ يَأْتِكُمْ نَبَأُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِن قَبْلُ فَذَاقُواْ وَبَالَ أَمْرِهِمْ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ,Has there not come to you O disbelievers of Mecca the tidings the story of those who disbelieved before and thus tasted the evil consequences of their conduct? they tasted the punishment for disbelief in this world. And there will be for them in the Hereafter a painful chastisement?
ذَلِكَ بِأَنَّهُ كَانَت تَّأْتِيهِمْ رُسُلُهُم بِٱلْبَيِّنَاتِ فَقَالُوۤاْ أَبَشَرٌ يَهْدُونَنَا فَكَفَرُواْ وَتَوَلَّواْ وَّٱسْتَغْنَىٰ ٱللَّهُ وَٱللَّهُ غَنِيٌّ حَمِيدٌ,That chastisement in this world is because bi-annahu contains the pronoun of the matter their messengers used to bring them clear signs manifest proofs for the validity of faith but they said ‘Shall mere humans basharan is meant as generic be our guides?’ So they disbelieved and turned away from faith and God was independent without need of their faith. And God is Independent without need of His creatures Praised praiseworthy in His actions.
زَعَمَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوۤاْ أَن لَّن يُبْعَثُواْ قُلْ بَلَىٰ وَرَبِّي لَتُبْعَثُنَّ ثُمَّ لَتُنَبَّؤُنَّ بِمَا عَمِلْتُمْ وَذَلِكَ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ يَسِيرٌ,Those who disbelieve claim that an is softened its subject having been omitted that is to say annahum they will never be resurrected. Say ‘Yes indeed by my Lord! You will be resurrected; then you will be informed of what you did. And that is easy for God’.
فَآمِنُواْ بِٱللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ وَٱلنّورِ ٱلَّذِيۤ أَنزَلْنَا وَٱللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيرٌ,So believe in God and His Messenger and the Light the Qur’ān which We have revealed. And God is Aware of what you do.
يَوْمَ يَجْمَعُكُمْ لِيَوْمِ ٱلْجَمْعِ ذَلِكَ يَوْمُ ٱلتَّغَابُنِ وَمَن يُؤْمِن بِٱللَّهِ وَيَعْمَلْ صَالِحاً يُكَفِّرْ عَنْهُ سَيِّئَاتِهِ وَيُدْخِلْهُ جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلأَنْهَارُ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَآ أَبَداً ذَلِكَ ٱلْفَوْزُ ٱلْعَظِيمُ,Mention the day when He will gather you for the Day of Gathering the Day of Resurrection that will be the Day of Dispossession on which the believers will dupe the disbelievers by occupying what would have been their places in Paradise had they believed as well as appropriating their believing spouses. And as for those who believe in God and act righteously He will absolve them of their misdeeds and admit them into gardens underneath which rivers flow a variant reading for both verbs has the first person plural wherein they will abide. That is the supreme triumph.
وَٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَكَذَّبُواْ بِآيَٰتِنَآ أُوْلَـٰئِكَ أَصْحَٰبُ ٱلنَّارِ خَٰلِدِينَ فِيهَا وَبِئْسَ ٱلْمَصِيرُ,And as for those who disbelieved and denied Our signs — the Qur’ān — those they will be the inhabitants of the Fire wherein they will abide. And what an evil journey’s end! it is.
مَآ أَصَابَ مِن مُّصِيبَةٍ إِلاَّ بِإِذْنِ ٱللَّهِ وَمَن يُؤْمِن بِٱللَّهِ يَهْدِ قَلْبَهُ وَٱللَّهُ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عَلِيمٌ,No affliction strikes except by the leave of God by His decree. And whoever believes in God in His saying that every affliction is by His decreeing it He will guide his heart to endure it patiently. And God is Knower of all things.
وَأَطِيعُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَأَطِيعُواْ ٱلرَّسُولَ فَإِن تَولَّيْتُمْ فَإِنَّمَا عَلَىٰ رَسُولِنَا ٱلْبَلاَغُ ٱلْمُبِينُ,And obey God and obey the Messenger; but if you turn away then the Messenger’s duty is only to communicate the Message clearly.
ٱللَّهُ لاَ إِلَـٰهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ وَعَلَى ٱللَّهِ فَلْيَتَوَكَّلِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ,God — there is no god except Him. And in God let all believers put their trust.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُوۤاْ إِنَّ مِنْ أَزْوَاجِكُمْ وَأَوْلاَدِكُمْ عَدُوّاً لَّكُمْ فَٱحْذَرُوهُمْ وَإِن تَعْفُواْ وَتَصْفَحُواْ وَتَغْفِرُواْ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,O you who believe! Indeed among your wives and children there are enemies for you so beware of them of obeying them in neglecting the performance of good deeds such as struggling or emigrating — because the reason why this verse was revealed was precisely their obedience of them in such matters. And if you pardon them for their impeding you from such good deeds justifying it on account of the distress that parting with you causes them and overlook such enmity and forgive then assuredly God is Forgiving Merciful.
إِنَّمَآ أَمْوَالُكُمْ وَأَوْلاَدُكُمْ فِتْنَةٌ وَٱللَّهُ عِنْدَهُ أَجْرٌ عَظِيمٌ,Your possessions and your children are only a trial for you distracting you from the concerns of the Hereafter and God — with Him is a great reward so do not forfeit it by preoccupying yourselves with possessions and children.
فَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ مَا ٱسْتَطَعْتُمْ وَٱسْمَعُواْ وَأَطِيعُواْ وَأَنْفِقُواْ خَيْراً لأَنفُسِكُمْ وَمَن يُوقَ شُحَّ نَفْسِهِ فَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْمُفْلِحُونَ,So fear God as far as you can — this abrogates His saying Fear God as He should be feared Q. 3102 — and listen to what you have been enjoined to listening disposed to accept and obey and expend in obedience to Him; that is better for your souls khayran li-anfusikum is the predicate of an implied yakun ‘that is’ and the response to the imperative. And whoever is shielded from the avarice of his own soul such are the successful the winners.
إِن تُقْرِضُواْ ٱللَّهَ قَرْضاً حَسَناً يُضَاعِفْهُ لَكُمْ وَيَغْفِرْ لَكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ شَكُورٌ حَلِيمٌ,If you lend God a good loan by giving voluntary alms out of the goodness of your hearts He will multiply it for you yudā‘ifhu a variant reading has yuda‘‘ifhu from tenfold up to seven hundredfold or more for each one — this loan being the giving of voluntary alms out of the goodness of the heart — and He will forgive you whatever He will and God is Appreciative rewarding of obedience Forbearing in refraining from always punishing disobedience;
عَالِمُ ٱلْغَيْبِ وَٱلشَّهَادَةِ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ,Knower of the Unseen the hidden and the visible the disclosed the Mighty in His kingdom the Wise in His actions.
يٰأيُّهَا ٱلنَّبِيُّ إِذَا طَلَّقْتُمُ ٱلنِّسَآءَ فَطَلِّقُوهُنَّ لِعِدَّتِهِنَّ وَأَحْصُواْ ٱلْعِدَّةَ وَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ رَبَّكُمْ لاَ تُخْرِجُوهُنَّ مِن بُيُوتِهِنَّ وَلاَ يَخْرُجْنَ إِلاَّ أَن يَأْتِينَ بِفَاحِشَةٍ مُّبَيِّنَةٍ وَتِلْكَ حُدُودُ ٱللَّهِ وَمَن يَتَعَدَّ حُدُودَ ٱللَّهِ فَقَدْ ظَلَمَ نَفْسَهُ لاَ تَدْرِى لَعَلَّ ٱللَّهَ يُحْدِثُ بَعْدَ ذَلِكَ أَمْراً,O Prophet meaning to address his community on account of what follows; or it means say to them when you men divorce women when you intend to effect a divorce divorce them by their prescribed period at the beginning of it such that the divorce is effected while she is pure and has not been touched sexually based on the Prophet’s s explaining it in this way as reported by the two Shaykhs al-Bukhārī and Muslim. And count the prescribed period keep record of it so that you may repeal your decision before it is concluded; and fear God your Lord obey Him in His commands and prohibitions. Do not expel them from their houses nor let them go forth from them until their prescribed period is concluded unless they commit a blatant act of indecency such as adultery read mubayyana or mubayyina corresponding respectively to buyyinat ‘one that has been proven’ and bayyina ‘blatant’ in which case they are brought out in order to carry out the prescribed legal punishment against them. And those mentioned stipulations are God’s bounds; and whoever transgresses the bounds of God has verily wronged his soul. You never know it may be that God will bring something new to pass afterwards after the divorce such as a retraction in the event that it was the first or second declaration of divorce.
فَإِذَا بَلَغْنَ أَجَلَهُنَّ فَأَمْسِكُوهُنَّ بِمَعْرُوفٍ أَوْ فَارِقُوهُنَّ بِمَعْرُوفٍ وَأَشْهِدُواْ ذَوَىْ عَدْلٍ مِّنكُمْ وَأَقِيمُواْ ٱلشَّهَادَةَ لِلَّهِ ذَلِكُمْ يُوعَظُ بِهِ مَن كَانَ يُؤْمِنُ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلآخِرِ وَمَن يَتَّقِ ٱللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مَخْرَجاً,Then when they have reached their term when they are near the end of their prescribed period retain them by taking them back honourably without coercion or separate from them honourably leave them to conclude their waiting period and do not compel them to go back to you. And call to witness two just men from among yourselves to witness the retraction or the separation and bear witness for the sake of God and not merely for the sake of what is being witnessed or for the sake of the man. By this is exhorted whoever believes in God and the Last Day. And whoever fears God He will make a way out for him from the distress of this world and the Hereafter;
وَيَرْزُقْهُ مِنْ حَيْثُ لاَ يَحْتَسِبُ وَمَن يَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ فَهُوَ حَسْبُهُ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ بَالِغُ أَمْرِهِ قَدْ جَعَلَ ٱللَّهُ لِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدْراً,and He will provide for him from whence he never expected from whence it never occurred to him. And whoever puts his trust in God regarding his affairs He will suffice him. Indeed God fulfils His command His will a variant reading for bālighun amrahu has the genitive construction bālighu amrihi. Verily God has ordained for everything even things such as comfort and hardship a measure a fixed time.
وَٱللاَّئِي يَئِسْنَ مِنَ ٱلْمَحِيضِ مِن نِّسَآئِكُمْ إِنِ ٱرْتَبْتُمْ فَعِدَّتُهُنَّ ثَلاَثَةُ أَشْهُرٍ وَٱللاَّئِي لَمْ يَحِضْنَ وَأُوْلاَتُ ٱلأَحْمَالِ أَجَلُهُنَّ أَن يَضَعْنَ حَمْلَهُنَّ وَمَن يَتَّقِ ٱللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مِنْ أَمْرِهِ يُسْراً,And as for those of your women who read allā’ī or allā’i in both instances no longer expect to menstruate if you have any doubts about their waiting period their prescribed waiting period shall be three months and also for those who have not yet menstruated because of their young age their period shall also be three months — both cases apply to other than those whose spouses have died; for these latter their period is prescribed in the verse they shall wait by themselves for four months and ten days Q. 2234. And those who are pregnant their term the conclusion of their prescribed waiting period if divorced or if their spouses be dead shall be when they deliver. And whoever fears God He will make matters ease for him in this world and in the Hereafter.
ذَلِكَ أَمْرُ ٱللَّهِ أَنزَلَهُ إِلَيْكُمْ وَمَن يَتَّقِ ٱللَّهَ يُكَفِّرْ عَنْهُ سَيِّئَاتِهِ وَيُعْظِمْ لَهُ أَجْراً,That which is mentioned regarding the prescribed waiting period is God’s command His ruling which He has revealed to you. And whoever fears God He will absolve him of his misdeeds and magnify the reward for him.
أَسْكِنُوهُنَّ مِنْ حَيْثُ سَكَنتُم مِّن وُجْدِكُمْ وَلاَ تُضَآرُّوهُنَّ لِتُضَيِّقُواْ عَلَيْهِنَّ وَإِن كُنَّ أُوْلاَتِ حَمْلٍ فَأَنفِقُواْ عَلَيْهِنَّ حَتَّىٰ يَضَعْنَ حَمْلَهُنَّ فَإِنْ أَرْضَعْنَ لَكُمْ فَآتُوهُنَّ أُجُورَهُنَّ وَأْتَمِرُواْ بَيْنَكُمْ بِمَعْرُوفٍ وَإِن تَعَاسَرْتُمْ فَسَتُرْضِعُ لَهُ أُخْرَىٰ,Lodge them that is the divorced women where you dwell that is to say in some part of your dwellings in accordance with your means min wujdikum is an explicative supplement or a substitution of what precedes it with the repetition of the same preposition min and with an implied genitive annexation in other words something like amkinat sa‘atikum ‘house them in the places of your means and not otherwise’ and do not harass them so as to put them in straits with regard to accommodation such that they would then need to go elsewhere or be in need of maintenance to provide for themselves so that they are forced to ransom themselves from you. And if they are pregnant then maintain them until they deliver. Then if they suckle for you your children whom you have from them give them their wages for the suckling and consult together with them honourably with kindness for the sake of the children by mutual agreement on a fixed wage for the suckling. But if you both make difficulties regarding the suckling with either the father withholding payment of the wage or the mother refraining from performing it then another woman will suckle the child for him for the father and the mother should not be compelled to suckle it.
لِيُنفِقْ ذُو سَعَةٍ مِّن سَعَتِهِ وَمَن قُدِرَ عَلَيْهِ رِزْقُهُ فَلْيُنفِقْ مِمَّآ آتَاهُ ٱللَّهُ لاَ يُكَلِّفُ ٱللَّهُ نَفْساً إِلاَّ مَآ آتَاهَا سَيَجْعَلُ ٱللَّهُ بَعْدَ عُسْرٍ يُسْراً,Let the affluent man expend on the divorced or the suckling woman out of his affluence. And let he whose provision has been straitened restricted for him expend of what God has given him in accordance with his means. God does not charge any soul save except with what He has given it. God will assuredly bring about ease after hardship — which He indeed did by way of the Muslim conquests.
وَكَأِيِّن مِّن قَرْيَةٍ عَتَتْ عَنْ أَمْرِ رَبِّهَا وَرُسُلِهِ فَحَاسَبْنَاهَا حِسَاباً شَدِيداً وَعَذَّبْنَاهَا عَذَاباً نُّكْراً,And how many ka’ayyin the kāf is the genitive prepositional particle which has been added to ayy ‘which’ to give the meaning of kam ‘how many’ a town — that is to say many a town meaning its inhabitants disobeyed the command of its Lord and His messengers then We called it in the Hereafter — even if it has not yet arrived God says so because of the fact that it will surely come to pass — to a severe reckoning and chastised it with a dire chastisement read nukran or nukuran namely the chastisement of the Fire.
فَذَاقَتْ وَبَالَ أَمْرِهَا وَكَانَ عَاقِبَةُ أَمْرِهَا خُسْراً,So it tasted the evil consequences of its conduct the punishment for it and the consequence of its conduct was utter loss failure and destruction.
أَعَدَّ ٱللَّهُ لَهُمْ عَذَاباً شَدِيداً فَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ يٰأُوْلِي ٱلأَلْبَابِ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ قَدْ أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ إِلَيْكُمْ ذِكْراً,God has prepared for them a severe chastisement the reiteration of the threat is for emphasis. So fear God O people of pith O possessors of intellect you who believe! this is a description of the vocative or an explication of it God has certainly revealed to you a source of remembrance that is the Qur’ān;
رَّسُولاً يَتْلُواْ عَلَيْكُمْ آيَاتِ ٱللَّهِ مُبَيِّنَاتٍ لِّيُخْرِجَ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّالِحَاتِ مِنَ ٱلظُّلُمَاتِ إِلَى ٱلنُّورِ وَمَن يُؤْمِن بِٱللَّهِ وَيَعْمَلْ صَالِحاً يُدْخِلْهُ جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلأَنْهَارُ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَآ أَبَداً قَدْ أَحْسَنَ ٱللَّهُ لَهُ رِزْقاً,a messenger that is Muhammad (s) rasūlan is in the accusative because of an implied verb that is to say wa-arsala ‘and He sent you a messenger’ reciting to you the clear signs of God read mubayyanāt or mubayyināt as explained above that He may bring forth those who believe and perform righteous deeds after the arrival of the remembrance and the Messenger from darkness the disbelief to which they adhered to light the faith that was established in them after a life of disbelief. And those who believe in God and act righteously He will admit them a variant reading has the first person plural nudkhilhu ‘We will admit them’ into gardens underneath which rivers flow wherein they will abide forever. God has verily made a good provision for him namely the provision of Paradise the bliss of which never ends.
ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِي خَلَقَ سَبْعَ سَمَٰوَٰتٍ وَمِنَ ٱلأَرْضِ مِثْلَهُنَّ يَتَنَزَّلُ ٱلأَمْرُ بَيْنَهُنَّ لِّتَعْلَمُوۤاْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ قَدْ أَحَاطَ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عِلْماً,God it is Who created seven heavens and of earth the like thereof that is to say seven earths. The command the revelation descends between them between the heavens and the earth Gabriel descends with it from the seventh heaven to the seventh earth that you may know li-ta‘lamū is semantically connected to an omitted clause that is to say ‘He apprises you of this creation and this sending down that you may know’ that God has power over all things and that God encompasses all things in knowledge.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّبِيُّ لِمَ تُحَرِّمُ مَآ أَحَلَّ ٱللَّهُ لَكَ تَبْتَغِي مَرْضَاتَ أَزْوَاجِكَ وَٱللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,O Prophet! Why do you prohibit what God has made lawful for you in terms of your Coptic handmaiden Māriya — when he lay with her in the house of Hafsa who had been away but who upon returning and finding out became upset by the fact that this had taken place in her own house and on her own bed — by saying ‘She is unlawful for me!’ seeking by making her unlawful for you to please your wives? And God is Forgiving Merciful having forgiven you this prohibition.
قَدْ فَرَضَ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمْ تَحِلَّةَ أَيْمَانِكُمْ وَٱللَّهُ مَوْلاَكُمْ وَهُوَ ٱلْعَلِيمُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ,Verily God has prescribed He has made lawful for you when necessary the absolution of your oaths to absolve them by expiation as mentioned in the sūrat al-Mā’ida Q. 589 and the forbidding of sexual relations with a handmaiden counts as an oath so did the Prophet s expiate? Muqātil b. Sulaymān said ‘He set free a slave in expiation for his prohibition of Māriya’; whereas al-Hasan al-Basrī said ‘He never expiated because the Prophet s has been forgiven all errors’. And God is your Protector your Helper and He is the Knower the Wise.
وَإِذْ أَسَرَّ ٱلنَّبِيُّ إِلَىٰ بَعْضِ أَزْوَاجِهِ حَدِيثاً فَلَمَّا نَبَّأَتْ بِهِ وَأَظْهَرَهُ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ عَرَّفَ بَعْضَهُ وَأَعْرَضَ عَن بَعْضٍ فَلَمَّا نَبَّأَهَا بِهِ قَالَتْ مَنْ أَنبَأَكَ هَـٰذَا قَالَ نَبَّأَنِيَ ٱلْعَلِيمُ ٱلْخَبِيرُ,And mention when the Prophet confided to one of his wives namely Hafsa a certain matter which was his prohibition of Māriya telling her ‘Do not reveal it!’; but when she divulged it to ‘Ā’isha reckoning there to be no blame in doing such a thing and God apprised him He informed him of it of what had been divulged he announced part of it to Hafsa and passed over part out of graciousness on his part. So when he told her about it she said ‘Who told you this?’ He said ‘I was told by the Knower the Aware’ namely God.
إِن تَتُوبَآ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ فَقَدْ صَغَتْ قُلُوبُكُمَا وَإِن تَظَاهَرَا عَلَيْهِ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ مَوْلاَهُ وَجِبْرِيلُ وَصَالِحُ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَالْمَلاَئِكَةُ بَعْدَ ذَلِكَ ظَهِيرٌ,If the two of you namely Hafsa and ‘Ā’isha repent to God … for your hearts were certainly inclined towards the prohibition of Māriya that is to say your keeping this secret despite knowing the Prophet’s s dislike of it which is itself a sin the response to the conditional ‘if the two of you repent to God’ has been omitted to be understood as ‘it will be accepted of both of you’; the use of the plural qulūb ‘hearts’ instead of the dual qalbayn ‘both your hearts’ is on account of the cumbersomeness of putting two duals together in what is effectively the same word; and if you support one another tazzāharā the original second tā’ of tatazāharā has been assimilated with the zā’; a variant reading has it without this assimilation tazāharā against him that is the Prophet in what he is averse to then know that God He huwa a pronoun for separation is indeed his Protector His supporter and Gabriel and the righteous among the believers Abū Bakr and ‘Umar may God be pleased with both of them wa-Jibrīlu wa-sālihu’l-mu’minīna is a supplement to the syntactical locus of the subject of inna sc. ‘God’ who will also be his supporters and the angels furthermore further to the support of God and those mentioned are his supporters assistants of his in supporting him to prevail over both of you.
عَسَىٰ رَبُّهُ إِن طَلَّقَكُنَّ أَن يُبْدِلَهُ أَزْوَاجاً خَيْراً مِّنكُنَّ مُسْلِمَاتٍ مُّؤْمِنَاتٍ قَانِتَاتٍ تَائِبَاتٍ عَابِدَاتٍ سَائِحَاتٍ ثَيِّبَاتٍ وَأَبْكَاراً,It may be that if he divorces you that is if the Prophet divorces his wives his Lord will give him in your stead read yubaddilahu or yubdilahu wives better than you azwājan khayran minkunna is the predicate of ‘asā ‘it may be’ the sentence being the response to the conditional — the replacement of his wives by God never took place because the condition of his divorcing them never arose — women submissive to God affirming Islam believing faithful obedient penitent devout given to fasting — or given to emigrating in God’s way — previously married and virgins.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ قُوۤاْ أَنفُسَكُمْ وَأَهْلِيكُمْ نَاراً وَقُودُهَا ٱلنَّاسُ وَٱلْحِجَارَةُ عَلَيْهَا مَلاَئِكَةٌ غِلاَظٌ شِدَادٌ لاَّ يَعْصُونَ ٱللَّهَ مَآ أَمَرَهُمْ وَيَفْعَلُونَ مَا يُؤْمَرُونَ,O you who believe! Guard yourselves and your families by enjoining obedience to God against a Fire whose fuel is disbelieving people and stones such as those idols of theirs made of that stone — the meaning is that it is extremely hot fuelled by the above-mentioned unlike the fire of this world which is fuelled by wood and the like — over which stand angels its keepers — numbering nineteen as will be stated in sūrat al-Muddaththir Q. 7430 — stern a sternness of the heart mighty in their power of assault who do not disobey God in what He commands them mā amarahum is a substitution for His Majesty ‘God’ in other words they do not disobey the command of God but do what they are commanded — this is reiterated for emphasis; the verse is meant as a threat to deter believers from apostatising and for hypocrites who believe only with their tongues and not with their hearts.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لاَ تَعْتَذِرُواْ ٱلْيَوْمَ إِنَّمَا تُجْزَوْنَ مَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ,‘O you who disbelieve! Do not make any excuses today — this is said to them upon their entering the Fire — in other words because this excusing will be of no use to you. You are only being requited for what you used to do’ that is only the due requital thereof.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ تُوبُوۤاْ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ تَوْبَةً نَّصُوحاً عَسَىٰ رَبُّكُمْ أَن يُكَفِّرَ عَنكُمْ سَيِّئَاتِكُمْ وَيُدْخِلَكُمْ جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلأَنْهَارُ يَوْمَ لاَ يُخْزِى ٱللَّهُ ٱلنَّبِيَّ وَٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ مَعَهُ نُورُهُمْ يَسْعَىٰ بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَبِأَيْمَانِهِمْ يَقُولُونَ رَبَّنَآ أَتْمِمْ لَنَا نُورَنَا وَٱغْفِرْ لَنَآ إِنَّكَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,O you who believe! Repent to God with sincere repentance read nasūhan or nusūhan a truthful repentance so that one does not return to committing that sin again nor have the desire to return to it. It may be that your Lord ‘asā an expression denoting ‘a hope’ that will be realised will absolve you of your misdeeds and admit you into gardens orchards underneath which rivers flow on the day when God will not let down by admitting into the Fire the Prophet and those who believe with him. Their light will be running before them in front of them and it will be on their right. They will say yaqūlūna this denotes the beginning of a new syntactically independent sentence ‘Our Lord! Perfect our light for us towards Paradise — whereas the hypocrites their light will be extinguished — and forgive us Our Lord. Assuredly You have power over all things’.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّبِيُّ جَاهِدِ ٱلْكُفَّارَ وَٱلْمُنَافِقِينَ وَٱغْلُظْ عَلَيْهِمْ وَمَأْوَاهُمْ جَهَنَّمُ وَبِئْسَ ٱلْمَصِيرُ,O Prophet! Struggle against the disbelievers with the sword and the hypocrites by the tongue and with argument and be stern with them in rebuke and hatred. For their abode will be Hell — and what an evil journey’s end! it is.
ضَرَبَ ٱللَّهُ مَثَلاً لِّلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ ٱمْرَأَتَ نُوحٍ وَٱمْرَأَتَ لُوطٍ كَانَتَا تَحْتَ عَبْدَيْنِ مِنْ عِبَادِنَا صَالِحَيْنِ فَخَانَتَاهُمَا فَلَمْ يُغْنِيَا عَنْهُمَا مِنَ ٱللَّهِ شَيْئاً وَقِيلَ ٱدْخُلاَ ٱلنَّارَ مَعَ ٱلدَّاخِلِينَ,God has struck a similitude for those who disbelieve the wife of Noah and the wife of Lot. They were under two of Our righteous servants yet they betrayed them in their religion for they both disbelieved — Noah’s wife called Wāhila used to say to his people that he was a madman while Lot’s wife called Wā‘ila used to tell his people the whereabouts of his guests when they stayed with him at night by lighting a fire and during the day by making smoke. So they that is Noah and Lot did not avail the two women in any way against God against His chastisement and it was said to the two women ‘Enter both of you the Fire along with the incomers’ from among the disbelievers of the peoples of Noah and Lot.
وَضَرَبَ ٱللَّهُ مَثَلاً لِّلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ ٱمْرَأَتَ فِرْعَوْنَ إِذْ قَالَتْ رَبِّ ٱبْنِ لِي عِندَكَ بَيْتاً فِي ٱلْجَنَّةِ وَنَجِّنِي مِن فِرْعَوْنَ وَعَمَلِهِ وَنَجِّنِي مِنَ ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ,And God has struck a similitude for those who believe the wife of Pharaoh — she believed in Moses her name was Āsiya; Pharaoh chastised her by tying her hands and feet to pegs and placing a huge millstone on her chest and having her laid out in the sun; but when those in charge of her would leave her the angels would come to shade her — when she said during her torture ‘My Lord build for me a home near You in Paradise — so He disclosed for her a veil of the Unseen and she saw it which in turn alleviated for her the torture — and deliver me from Pharaoh and his work his torture and deliver me from the evildoing folk’ the followers of his Pharaoh’s religion whereat God took unto Himself her spirit in death. Ibn Kaysān said ‘She was raised to Paradise alive where she eats and drinks’.
وَمَرْيَمَ ٱبْنَتَ عِمْرَانَ ٱلَّتِيۤ أَحْصَنَتْ فَرْجَهَا فَنَفَخْنَا فِيهِ مِن رُّوحِنَا وَصَدَّقَتْ بِكَلِمَاتِ رَبِّهَا وَكُتُبِهِ وَكَانَتْ مِنَ ٱلْقَانِتِينَ,And Mary wa-Maryama is a supplement to imra’ata Fir‘awna daughter of ‘Imrān who preserved the chastity of her womb so We breathed into it of Our Spirit namely Gabriel — when he breathed into the opening of her shirt by God’s creation of this action of his which reached her womb thus conceiving Jesus — and she confirmed the words of her Lord His prescriptions and His revealed Scriptures and she was of the obedient one of the obedient folk.
تَبَارَكَ ٱلَّذِي بِيَدِهِ ٱلْمُلْكُ وَهُوَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ,Blessed exalted above the attributes of created beings is He in Whose hand at Whose disposal is all sovereignty all authority and power and He has power over all things.
ٱلَّذِي خَلَقَ ٱلْمَوْتَ وَٱلْحَيَاةَ لِيَبْلُوَكُمْ أَيُّكُمْ أَحْسَنُ عَمَلاً وَهُوَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْغَفُورُ,He Who created death in this world and life in the Hereafter — or both of them in this world since the sperm-drop is imbued with life life being that power by which sensation becomes possible death being the opposite of this or the non-existence of it — these being two alternative opinions; in the case of the latter life in the Hereafter ‘creation’ implies ‘ordainment’ — that He may try you that He may test you in this life to see which of you is best in conduct which of you is most obedient to God and He is the Mighty in His vengeance against those who disobey Him the Forgiving to those who repent to Him;
ٱلَّذِي خَلَقَ سَبْعَ سَمَٰوَٰتٍ طِبَاقاً مَّا تَرَىٰ فِي خَلْقِ ٱلرَّحْمَـٰنِ مِن تَفَاوُتٍ فَٱرْجِعِ ٱلْبَصَرَ هَلْ تَرَىٰ مِن فُطُورٍ,Who created seven heavens in layers one above the other without any contact between them. You do not see in the Compassionate One’s creation of these or of other things any irregularity any disparity or discordance. Then cast your eyes again turn them toward the heaven Do you see in it any fissure? any cracks or ruptures?
ثُمَّ ٱرجِعِ ٱلبَصَرَ كَرَّتَيْنِ يَنْقَلِبْ إِلَيْكَ ٱلبَصَرُ خَاسِئاً وَهُوَ حَسِيرٌ,Then cast your eyes yet again once and then twice and your sight will return to you humbled abject on account of it not perceiving any fissure and wearied unable to see any fissure.
وَلَقَدْ زَيَّنَّا ٱلسَّمَآءَ ٱلدُّنْيَا بِمَصَٰبِيحَ وَجَعَلْنَٰهَا رُجُوماً لِّلشَّيَٰطِينِ وَأَعْتَدْنَا لَهُمْ عَذَابَ ٱلسَّعِيرِ,And verily We have adorned the lowest heaven the one closest to the earth with lamps with stars and made them missiles against the devils should they attempt to listen by stealth in which case a meteor of fire detaches itself from the star just like a brand is taken from a fire and either kills that jinn or deprives him of his senses it is not that the star itself is displaced from its position; and We have prepared for them the chastisement of the Blaze the ignited Fire.
وَلِلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ بِرَبِّهِمْ عَذَابُ جَهَنَّمَ وَبِئْسَ ٱلْمَصِيرُ,And for those who disbelieve in their Lord there is the chastisement of Hell and what an evil journey’s end! it is.
إِذَآ أُلْقُواْ فِيهَا سَمِعُواْ لَهَا شَهِيقاً وَهِيَ تَفُورُ,When they are flung into it they hear it blaring producing a horrid sound like that of an ass as it seethes
تَكَادُ تَمَيَّزُ مِنَ الغَيْظِ كُلَّمَا أُلْقِيَ فِيهَا فَوْجٌ سَأَلَهُمْ خَزَنَتُهَآ أَلَمْ يَأْتِكُمْ نَذِيرٌ,almost exploding tamayyazu a variant reading has the original form tatamayyazu ripped apart with rage in wrath against the disbelievers. Whenever a host a group of them is flung into it its keepers ask them an interrogation of rebuke ‘Did there not come to you a warner?’ a messenger to warn you of God’s chastisement.
قَالُواْ بَلَىٰ قَدْ جَآءَنَا نَذِيرٌ فَكَذَّبْنَا وَقُلْنَا مَا نَزَّلَ ٱللَّهُ مِن شَيْءٍ إِنْ أَنتُمْ إِلاَّ فِي ضَلاَلٍ كَبِيرٍ,They will say ‘Yes a warner did indeed come to us but we denied and said “God has not revealed anything; you are assuredly in great error”’ this last words may be the words of the angels spoken to the disbelievers when they are told of the denial or they may belong to the words of the disbelievers spoken to the warners.
وَقَالُواْ لَوْ كُنَّا نَسْمَعُ أَوْ نَعْقِلُ مَا كُنَّا فِيۤ أَصْحَابِ ٱلسَّعِيرِ,And they will say ‘Had we listened that is listening so as to understand or comprehended that is comprehension entailing reflection upon the truth we would not have been among the inhabitants of the Blaze’.
فَٱعْتَرَفُواْ بِذَنبِهِمْ فَسُحْقاً لأَصْحَابِ ٱلسَّعِيرِ,Thus they will confess when confession is of no avail their sin which was their denial of the warners. So away suhqan or suhuqan with the inhabitants of the Blaze! so far away may they be from God’s mercy.
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يَخْشَوْنَ رَبَّهُم بِٱلْغَيْبِ لَهُم مَّغْفِرَةٌ وَأَجْرٌ كَبِيرٌ,Assuredly those who fear their Lord in secret while they are absent from people’s eyes being obedient to Him in secret such that openly before people it is all the more likely that they fear their Lord — there will be for them forgiveness and a great reward namely Paradise.
وَأَسِرُّواْ قَوْلَكُمْ أَوِ ٱجْهَرُواْ بِهِ إِنَّهُ عَلِيمٌ بِذَاتِ ٱلصُّدُورِ,And whether you keep secret O people your speech or proclaim it He indeed exalted be He is Knower of what is in the breasts of what they contain so how much more so is He Knower in the case of what you utter openly — the reason for the revelation of this verse was that the idolaters said to one another ‘Speak secretly and Muhammad’s god will not hear you’.
أَلاَ يَعْلَمُ مَنْ خَلَقَ وَهُوَ ٱللَّطِيفُ ٱلْخَبِيرُ,Will He Who has created not know? what you keep secret in other words will His knowledge of things be precluded by such secret speech? And He is the Subtle in His knowledge the Aware therein.
هُوَ ٱلَّذِي جَعَلَ لَكُمُ ٱلأَرْضَ ذَلُولاً فَٱمْشُواْ فِي مَنَاكِبِهَا وَكُلُواْ مِن رِّزْقِهِ وَإِلَيْهِ ٱلنُّشُورُ,It is He Who made the earth tractable for you easy for you to walk on; so walk in its flanks and eat of His provision that has been created for you; and to Him is the resurrection from the graves for the Requital.
ءَأَمِنتُمْ مَّن فِي ٱلسَّمَآءِ أَن يَخْسِفَ بِكُمُ ٱلأَرْضَ فَإِذَا هِيَ تَمُورُ,Are you secure read a-amintum pronouncing both hamzas fully or by not pronouncing the second one inserting an alif between it and the other one or without the insertion but replacing it with an alif instead in thinking that He Who is in the heaven that He Whose authority and power is in the heaven will not cause the earth to swallow you an yakhsifa substitutes for man ‘He Who’ while it quakes? while it moves underneath you and rises above you?
أَمْ أَمِنتُمْ مِّن فِي ٱلسَّمَآءِ أَن يُرْسِلَ عَلَيْكُمْ حَاصِباً فَسَتَعْلَمُونَ كَيْفَ نَذِيرِ,Are you secure in thinking that He Who is in the heaven will not unleash an yursila substitutes for man ‘He Who’ upon you a squall of pebbles? a wind hurling pebbles at you. But you will soon come to know upon seeing the chastisement with your own eyes the nature of My warning My warning of chastisement in other words you will soon see that it was true.
وَلَقَدْ كَذَّبَ ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ فَكَيْفَ كَانَ نكِيرِ,And verily those communities who were before them denied then see how was My rebuttal! how was My rebuttal of them in destroying them when they denied in other words how it was true.
أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْا إِلَى ٱلطَّيْرِ فَوْقَهُمْ صَـٰفَّـٰتٍ وَيَقْبِضْنَ مَا يُمْسِكُهُنَّ إِلاَّ ٱلرَّحْمَـٰنُ إِنَّهُ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ بَصِيرٌ,Or have they not seen the birds above them in the air spreading their wings and closing? their wings after spreading them? in other words read wa-yaqbidna as wa-qābidātin similar to sāffātin ‘spreading’. Nothing sustains them from falling either when they are spreading them or closing them except the Compassionate One by His power. Indeed He is Seer of all things. The meaning is have they not inferred from the fact that the birds are able to remain in the air that We have the power to do with them what has been mentioned above as well as inflicting upon them other kinds of chastisement?
أَمَّنْ هَـٰذَا ٱلَّذِي هُوَ جُندٌ لَّكُمْ يَنصُرُكُمْ مِّن دُونِ ٱلرَّحْمَـٰنِ إِنِ ٱلْكَافِرُونَ إِلاَّ فِي غُرُورٍ,Or who am-man the subject is it hādhā its predicate that alladhī a substitution for hādhā ‘is it’ will be an army supporters for you lakum belongs to the relative clause of alladhī ‘that’ to help you yansurukum is an adjectival qualification of jundun ‘an army’ besides the Compassionate One? that is to say other than Him who is there that will be able to avert His chastisement from you in other words you have no helper. The disbelievers are in nothing but delusion Satan has deluded them into believing that the chastisement will not befall them.
أَمَّنْ هَـٰذَا ٱلَّذِي يَرْزُقُكُمْ إِنْ أَمْسَكَ رِزْقَهُ بَل لَّجُّواْ فِي عُتُوٍّ وَنُفُورٍ,Or who is it that will provide for you if He the Compassionate One withholds His provision? that is to say if He withholds the rain from you the response to the conditional has been omitted but is indicated by what preceded it namely the statement to the effect ‘who will provide for you?’ and so the response would be you have no provider other than Him. Nay but they persist in disdain and aversion moving away further from the truth.
أَفَمَن يَمْشِي مُكِبّاً عَلَىٰ وَجْهِهِ أَهْدَىٰ أَمَّن يَمْشِي سَوِيّاً عَلَى صِرَاطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ,Is he who walks cast down fallen on his face more rightly guided or he who walks upright on a straight path? the predicate of the second man ‘who’ has been omitted but is indicated by the predicate of the first namely ahdā ‘more rightly guided’; the similitude refers to the believer and the disbeliever and to which of the two is more rightly guided.
قُلْ هُوَ ٱلَّذِيۤ أَنشَأَكُمْ وَجَعَلَ لَكُمُ ٱلسَّمْعَ وَٱلأَبْصَارَ وَٱلأَفْئِدَةَ قَلِيلاً مَّا تَشْكُرُونَ,Say ‘It is He Who created you and endowed you with hearing and sight and hearts. Little do you thank!’ mā tashkurūna mā is extra; the sentence itself is a new independent one informing of how extremely little they give thanks for these graces.
قُلْ هُوَ ٱلَّذِي ذَرَأَكُمْ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَإِلَيْهِ تُحْشَرُونَ,Say ‘It is He Who multiplied you created you on earth and to Him you will be gathered’ for the Reckoning.
وَيَقُولُونَ مَتَىٰ هَـٰذَا ٱلْوَعْدُ إِن كُنتُمْ صَادِقِينَ,And they say to the believers ‘When will this promise be fulfilled the promise of the gathering if you are truthful?’ about it.
قُلْ إِنَّمَا ٱلْعِلْمُ عِنْدَ ٱللَّهِ وَإِنَّمَآ أَنَاْ نَذِيرٌ مُّبِينٌ,Say ‘The knowledge of its coming is only with God and I am but a plain warner’ one whose warning is plain.
فَلَمَّا رَأَوْهُ زُلْفَةً سِيئَتْ وُجُوهُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَقِيلَ هَـٰذَا ٱلَّذِي كُنتُم بِهِ تَدَّعُونَ,But when they see it that is the chastisement after the gathering near at hand the faces of those who disbelieved will be awry blackened and it will be said that is the keepers of Hell will say to them ‘This is that chastisement which the warning of which you used to make claims about’ claims to the effect that you would not be resurrected — this is the narration of a situation that will take place in the future and which has been expressed using the past tense in order to confirm that it will actually take place.
قُلْ أَرَأَيْتُمْ إِنْ أَهْلَكَنِيَ ٱللَّهُ وَمَن مَّعِيَ أَوْ رَحِمَنَا فَمَن يُجِيرُ ٱلْكَافِرِينَ مِنْ عَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ,Say ‘Have you considered If God destroys me and those with me of believers by His chastisement as you would have it or has mercy on us and does not chastise us who then will protect the disbelievers from a painful chastisement?’ in other words they will have no protector from it.
قُلْ هُوَ ٱلرَّحْمَـٰنُ آمَنَّا بِهِ وَعَلَيْهِ تَوَكَّلْنَا فَسَتَعْلَمُونَ مَنْ هُوَ فِي ضَلاَلٍ مُّبِينٍ,Say ‘He is the Compassionate One; we believe in Him and in Him we put our trust. And assuredly you will soon know sa-ta‘lamūna is also read sa-ya‘lamūna ‘they will know’ upon seeing the chastisement with your own eyes who is in manifest error’ is it us or yourselves or them?

It is commendable for one to say Allāhu rabbu’l-‘ālamīna ‘God Lord of the Worlds!’ after ma‘īn ‘running water’ as is stated in a hadīth. This verse was recited before a certain tyrant who then replied ‘Hatchets and pickaxes will bring it!’ whereupon the water of his eyes dried up and he became blind.

وَإِنِّي كُلَّمَا دَعَوْتُهُمْ لِتَغْفِرَ لَهُمْ جَعَلُوۤاْ أَصَابِعَهُمْ فِيۤ آذَانِهِمْ وَٱسْتَغْشَوْاْ ثِيَابَهُمْ وَأَصَرُّواْ وَٱسْتَكْبَرُواْ ٱسْتِكْبَاراً,And indeed whenever I summoned them so that You might forgive them they put their fingers in their ears in order not to hear what I say and draw their cloaks over themselves they cover their heads with them in order not to catch sight of me and they persist in their disbelief and act in great arrogance disdaining faith.
ثُمَّ إِنِّي دَعَوْتُهُمْ جِهَاراً,Then indeed I summoned them aloud that is to say at the top of my voice;
ثُمَّ إِنِّيۤ أَعْلَنْتُ لَهُمْ وَأَسْرَرْتُ لَهُمْ إِسْرَاراً,then assuredly I proclaimed to them with my voice and I confided my words to them secretly
فَقُلْتُ ٱسْتَغْفِرُواْ رَبَّكُمْ إِنَّهُ كَانَ غَفَّاراً,saying “Ask your Lord for forgiveness from idolatry. Assuredly He is ever Forgiving.

مَّا لَكُمْ لاَ تَرْجُونَ لِلَّهِ وَقَاراً,What is wrong with you that you do not hope for dignity from God that is to say that you do not hope that God will dignify you by becoming believers
وَقَدْ خَلَقَكُمْ أَطْوَاراً,when verily He created you in stages? atwār is the plural of tūr which means a state.

ثُمَّ يُعِيدُكُمْ فِيهَا وَيُخْرِجُكُمْ إِخْرَاجاً,Then He will make you return into it entombed in your graves and bring you forth for the resurrection with a veritable bringing forth.
وَٱللَّهُ جَعَلَ لَكُمُ ٱلأَرْضَ بِسَاطاً,And God has made the earth a flat open expanse for you
لِّتَسْلُكُواْ مِنْهَا سُبُلاً فِجَاجاً,so that you may follow throughout it spacious routes.” ’
قَالَ نُوحٌ رَّبِّ إِنَّهُمْ عَصَوْنِي وَٱتَّبَعُواْ مَن لَّمْ يَزِدْهُ مَالُهُ وَوَلَدُهُ إِلاَّ خَسَاراً,Noah said ‘My Lord they have disobeyed me and followed that is the riffraff and the paupers among them have followed those whose wealth and children namely their leaders who have been blessed with such things read wulduhu or waladuhu ‘whose children’ the first of which is said to be the plural of walad similar in pattern to khasab khushb or in fact it is said to be of the same meaning as walad but an alternative form as in the case of bukhl or bakhal ‘niggardliness’ only add to their loss to their insolence and disbelief.
وَمَكَرُواْ مَكْراً كُبَّاراً,And they have devised namely the leaders a mighty plot extremely outrageous by denying Noah and harming him as well as his followers
وَقَالُواْ لاَ تَذَرُنَّ آلِهَتَكُمْ وَلاَ تَذَرُنَّ وَدّاً وَلاَ سُوَاعاً وَلاَ يَغُوثَ وَيَعُوقَ وَنَسْراً,and have said to the riffraff “Do not abandon your gods and do not abandon Wadd read Wadd or Wudd nor Suwā‘ nor Yaghūth and Ya‘ūq and Nasr” — these being the names of their idols.
وَقَدْ أَضَلُّواْ كَثِيراً وَلاَ تَزِدِ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ إِلاَّ ضَلاَلاً,And they have certainly led astray by these gods many people by commanding them to worship them. And do not O God increase the evildoers except in error!’ wa-lā tazidi’l-zālimīna illā dalālan is a supplement to qad adallū ‘they have certainly led astray’ He Noah invoked God against them when it was revealed to him that ‘None of your people will believe except he who has already believed’ Q. 1136.
مِّمَّا خَطِيۤئَاتِهِمْ أُغْرِقُواْ فَأُدْخِلُواْ نَاراً فَلَمْ يَجِدُواْ لَهُمْ مِّن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ أَنصَاراً,Because of mimmā mā indicates a relative clause their iniquities khatāyāhum a variant reading has khatī’ātihim they were drowned by the Flood then made to enter the Fire with which they were punished underwater after drowning. And they did not find for themselves besides that is to say other than God any helpers to protect them against the chastisement.
وَقَالَ نُوحٌ رَّبِّ لاَ تَذَرْ عَلَى ٱلأَرْضِ مِنَ ٱلْكَافِرِينَ دَيَّاراً,And Noah said ‘My Lord do not leave from among the disbelievers a single dweller upon the earth dayyār means ‘one who inhabits a dwelling dār’ in other words not one.
إِنَّكَ إِن تَذَرْهُمْ يُضِلُّواْ عِبَادَكَ وَلاَ يَلِدُوۤاْ إِلاَّ فَاجِراً كَفَّاراً,Assuredly if You leave them they will lead Your servants astray and will beget only disbelieving profligates fājir and kaffār derive respectively from yafjuru and yakfuru he said this on account of the mentioned revelation that had been given to him.
رَّبِّ ٱغْفِرْ لِي وَلِوَالِدَيَّ وَلِمَن دَخَلَ بَيْتِيَ مُؤْمِناً وَلِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَٱلْمُؤْمِنَاتِ وَلاَ تَزِدِ ٱلظَّالِمِينَ إِلاَّ تَبَاراً,My Lord forgive me and my parents — both of whom were believers — and whoever enters my house my dwelling or my place of worship as a believer and believing men and believing women to the Day of Resurrection and do not increase the evildoers except in ruin’ in destruction — and thus they were destroyed.
قُلْ أُوحِيَ إِلَيَّ أَنَّهُ ٱسْتَمَعَ نَفَرٌ مِّنَ ٱلْجِنِّ فَقَالُوۤاْ إِنَّا سَمِعْنَا قُرْآناً عَجَباً,Say O Muhammad (s) to people ‘It has been revealed to me that is to say I have been informed by way of revelation from God exalted be He that annahu the suffixed pronoun is that of the matter a company of the jinn the jinn of Nasībīn. This was at the time of the morning prayer at Batn Nakhla a location between Mecca and Tā’if — these jinn being those mentioned in God’s saying And when We sent a company of jinn your way…’ Q. 4629 — listened to my recitation then said to their people upon returning to them “We have indeed heard a marvellous Qur’ān whose clarity the richness of its meanings and other aspects one marvels at
يَهْدِيۤ إِلَى ٱلرُّشْدِ فَآمَنَّا بِهِ وَلَن نُّشرِكَ بِرَبِّنَآ أَحَداً,which guides to rectitude to faith and propriety. Therefore we believe in it and we will never after this day associate anyone with our Lord.
وَأَنَّهُ تَعَالَىٰ جَدُّ رَبِّنَا مَا ٱتَّخَذَ صَاحِبَةً وَلاَ وَلَداً,And we believe that annahu the pronoun in this and in the next two instances is that of the matter — exalted be the majesty of our Lord transcendent is His majesty and magnificence above what is ascribed to Him — He has taken neither spouse nor son.
وَأَنَّهُ كَانَ يَقُولُ سَفِيهُنَا عَلَى ٱللَّهِ شَطَطاً,And that the fool among us the ignorant one among us used to utter atrocious lies against God extreme calumny by attributing to Him a spouse and a son.
وَأَنَّا ظَنَنَّآ أَن لَّن تَقُولَ ٱلإِنسُ وَٱلْجِنُّ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ كَذِباً,And we thought that an softened that is to say annahu humans and jinn would never utter a lie against God by attributing such things to Him until we discovered their mendacity thereby. God exalted be He says
وَأَنَّهُ كَانَ رِجَالٌ مِّنَ ٱلإِنسِ يَعُوذُونَ بِرِجَالٍ مِّنَ ٱلْجِنِّ فَزَادُوهُمْ رَهَقاً,And that certain individuals of mankind used to seek the protection of certain individuals of the jinn when they stopped over in dangerous places during their journeys — whereat every man would say ‘I seek the protection of the lord of this place against the evil of the insolent ones in it’ — so that they increased them by their seeking their protection in oppressiveness such that they would say ‘We are now lords of jinn and humans!’.
وَأَنَّهُمْ ظَنُّواْ كَمَا ظَنَنتُمْ أَن لَّن يَبْعَثَ ٱللَّهُ أَحَداً,And they namely the jinn thought just as you O humans thought that an softened in place of the hardened form that is to say annahu God would never raise anyone after his death.
وَأَنَّا لَمَسْنَا ٱلسَّمَآءَ فَوَجَدْنَاهَا مُلِئَتْ حَرَساً شَدِيداً وَشُهُباً,The jinn say And we made for the heaven we desired to listen by stealth but we found it filled with mighty guards from among the angels and meteors scorching stars this was at the time of the sending of the Prophet s.
وَأَنَّا كُنَّا نَقْعُدُ مِنْهَا مَقَاعِدَ لِلسَّمْعِ فَمَن يَسْتَمِعِ ٱلآنَ يَجِدْ لَهُ شِهَاباً رَّصَداً,And we used to that is to say before his Mission sit in certain places therein to listen in; but anyone listening now will find a meteor lying in wait for him aimed at him ready to strike him.
وَأَنَّا لاَ نَدْرِيۤ أَشَرٌّ أُرِيدَ بِمَن فِي ٱلأَرْضِ أَمْ أَرَادَ بِهِمْ رَبُّهُمْ رَشَداً,And we do not know by not being able to eavesdrop by stealth whether ill is intended for those who are in the earth or whether their Lord intends for them good.
وَأَنَّا مِنَّا ٱلصَّالِحُونَ وَمِنَّا دُونَ ذَلِكَ كُنَّا طَرَآئِقَ قِدَداً,And that among us some have become righteous after having listened to the Qur’ān and some of us are otherwise that is to say a folk who are unrighteous; we are made up of different sects opposing groups some submitters to God and others disbelievers.
وَأَنَّا ظَنَنَّآ أَن لَّن نُّعْجِزَ ٱللَّهَ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ وَلَن نُّعْجِزَهُ هَرَباً,And we assume that an softened in place of the hardened form that is to say annahu we will never be able to elude God in the earth nor will we be able to elude Him by fleeing — we will not be able to escape Him whether we are on earth or fleeing from it in the heavens.
وَأَنَّا لَمَّا سَمِعْنَا ٱلْهُدَىٰ آمَنَّا بِهِ فَمَن يُؤْمِن بِرَبِّهِ فَلاَ يَخَافُ بَخْساً وَلاَ رَهَقاً,And that when we heard the guidance the Qur’ān we believed in it. For whoever believes in his Lord read an implied huwa ‘he’ before fa-lā yakhāfu shall fear neither loss a diminishing of his good deeds nor oppression nor injustice by having his evil deeds increased.
وَأَنَّا مِنَّا ٱلْمُسْلِمُونَ وَمِنَّا ٱلْقَاسِطُونَ فَمَنْ أَسْلَمَ فَأُوْلَـٰئِكَ تَحَرَّوْاْ رَشَداً,And that among us some have submitted to God while some of us are unjust tyrants — on account of their disbelief. So whoever has submitted to God those are the ones who seek right guidance.
وَأَمَّا ٱلْقَاسِطُونَ فَكَانُواْ لِجَهَنَّمَ حَطَباً,And as for those are unjust they will be firewood fuel for Hell!” ’ annā annahum and annahu totalling all twelve instances above including innahu ta‘ālā and annā minnā’l-muslimūna and what comes in between them may be read with a kasra sc. innā innahum etc. indicating a new sentence every time or with a fatha sc. annā annahum etc. indicating the statement that will follow as a relative clause.
وَأَلَّوِ ٱسْتَقَامُواْ عَلَى ٱلطَّرِيقَةِ لأَسْقَيْنَاهُم مَّآءً غَدَقاً,God exalted be He says the following about the Meccan disbelievers And it has been revealed to me that if they allaw softened in place of the hardened form its subject having been omitted that is to say annahum law which is a supplement to annahu istama‘a ‘that a company of jinn listened’ adopt the right path the path of submission to God We will give them abundant water to drink plenteous water from the heaven — this was after rain had been withheld from them for seven years —
لِّنَفْتِنَهُمْ فِيهِ وَمَن يُعْرِضْ عَن ذِكْرِ رَبِّهِ يَسْلُكْهُ عَذَاباً صَعَداً,so that We may try them test them therein and so know through knowledge outwardly manifested the nature of their gratitude. And whoever turns away from the remembrance of his Lord from the Qur’ān We will admit him naslukhu or read first person yaslukhu ‘He will admit him’ into a tortuous chastisement.
وَأَنَّ ٱلْمَسَاجِدَ لِلَّهِ فَلاَ تَدْعُواْ مَعَ ٱللَّهِ أَحَداً,And it has been revealed to me that the places of prayer belong to God so do not invoke in them anyone along with God by associating others with Him like the Jews and Christians do who when they enter their churches and temples they ascribe partners to God.
وَأَنَّهُ لَمَّا قَامَ عَبْدُ ٱللَّهِ يَدْعُوهُ كَادُواْ يَكُونُونَ عَلَيْهِ لِبَداً,And that annahu; or innahu as a new sentence the pronoun being that of the matter when the servant of God the Prophet Muhammad (s) rose to invoke Him to worship Him at Batn Nakhla they that is the jinn listening to his recitation were almost upon him in heaps libadan or lubadan the plural of libda or lubda like felt in the way they were heaped on top of one another crowding in their eagerness to listen to the Qur’ān.
قُلْ إِنَّمَآ أَدْعُواْ رَبِّي وَلاَ أُشْرِكُ بِهِ أَحَداً,He said in response to the disbelievers saying ‘Abandon this affair of yours!’ a variant reading for qāla ‘he said’ has qul ‘Say’ ‘I invoke only my Lord as God and I do not associate anyone with Him’.
قُلْ إِنِّي لاَ أَمْلِكُ لَكُمْ ضَرّاً وَلاَ رَشَداً,Say ‘I truly have no power to bring you any harm to lead you astray or any guidance’ any good.
قُلْ إِنِّي لَن يُجِيرَنِي مِنَ ٱللَّهِ أَحَدٌ وَلَنْ أَجِدَ مِن دُونِهِ مُلْتَحَداً,Say ‘Indeed none shall protect me from God from His chastisement were I to disobey Him and I shall never find besides Him that is other than Him any refuge.
إِلاَّ بَلاَغاً مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَرِسَالاَتِهِ وَمَن يَعْصِ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ فَإِنَّ لَهُ نَارَ جَهَنَّمَ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَآ أَبَداً,I have power to bring you only a communication illā balāghan is excepted from the direct object clause of amliku ‘I have power to bring’ that is to say I have power only to communicate the Message to you from God that is on His behalf and His Messages wa-risālātihi is a supplement to balāghan ‘a communication’; what comes between the excepted clause and the clause from which it is excepted is a parenthetical statement intended to emphasise the preclusion of the Prophet’s ‘ability to bring them anything else’. And whoever disobeys God and His Messenger concerning the affirmation of His Oneness and hence does not believe — indeed there will be for him the fire of Hell abiding khālidīna is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the person indicated by man ‘whoever’ in lahu ‘for him’ taking into account its plural import; it khālidīna is also an implied circumstantial qualifier in other words they shall enter it with their abiding having been preordained therein forever’.
حَتَّىٰ إِذَا رَأَوْاْ مَا يُوعَدُونَ فَسَيَعْلَمُونَ مَنْ أَضْعَفُ نَاصِراً وَأَقَلُّ عَدَداً,Such that when they see hattā is for inceptiveness but also entailing a purposive sense to an implied preceding clause that is to say they persist in their disbelief until they come to see … what they are promised of chastisement they will then know at the moment that it befalls them either on the day of Badr or on the Day of Resurrection who is weaker in supporters and fewer in numbers in assistants is it them or the believers — according to the former reading? Or is it Me or them according to the latter. Some of them said ‘When will this promise be fulfilled?’ whereupon the following was revealed
قُلْ إِنْ أَدْرِيۤ أَقَرِيبٌ مَّا تُوعَدُونَ أَمْ يَجْعَلُ لَهُ رَبِّيۤ أَمَداً,Say ‘I do not know if what you are promised of chastisement is near or if my Lord has set a distant length for it an extent and a term which only He knows.
عَٰلِمُ ٱلْغَيْبِ فَلاَ يُظْهِرُ عَلَىٰ غَيْبِهِ أَحَداً,Knower He is of the Unseen what is hidden from servants and He does not disclose He does not reveal His Unseen to anyone from mankind
إِلاَّ مَنِ ٱرْتَضَىٰ مِن رَّسُولٍ فَإِنَّهُ يَسْلُكُ مِن بَيْنِ يَدَيْهِ وَمِنْ خَلْفِهِ رَصَداً,except to a messenger of whom He approves. Then in addition to disclosing to him what He will to disclose of it by way of making it a miracle for him He despatches He appoints and sends forth before him namely the Messenger and behind him watchers angels to preserve him until He has conveyed it to him as part of the entire revelation
لِّيَعْلَمَ أَن قَدْ أَبْلَغُواْ رِسَالاَتِ رَبِّهِمْ وَأَحَاطَ بِمَا لَدَيْهِمْ وَأَحْصَىٰ كُلَّ شَيْءٍ عَدَداً,so that He God may know by knowledge outwardly manifested that an softened in place of the hardened form that is to say annahu they that is the messengers have conveyed the Messages of their Lord the plural person of the verb ablaghū ‘they have conveyed’ takes into account the plural implication of man ‘whom’ and He encompasses all that is with them wa-ahāta bimā ladayhim is a supplement to an implied clause that is to say so He has knowledge of that and keeps count of all things’ ‘adadan ‘count’ is for specification; it is transformed from a direct object sc. ‘adada originally ahsā ‘adada kulli shay’in ‘He keeps count of all things’.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلْمُزَّمِّلُ,O you enwrapped in your garment! the Prophet al-muzzammil is actually al-mutazammil but the tā’ has been assimilated with the zāy that is to say the one who wraps himself up in his clothes when the Revelation Gabriel comes to him in fear of him because of his awe-inspiring presence.
قُمِ ٱلَّيلَ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً,Stand vigil perform prayer through the night except a little
نِّصْفَهُ أَوِ ٱنقُصْ مِنْهُ قَلِيلاً,a half of it nisfahu substitutes for qalīlan with ‘little’ being little by taking into account the whole night or reduce of it of the half a little up to a third
أَوْ زِدْ عَلَيْهِ وَرَتِّلِ ٱلْقُرْآنَ تَرْتِيلاً,or add to it up to two thirds aw implies free choice and recite the Qur’ān recite it carefully in a measured tone.
إِنَّا سَنُلْقِي عَلَيْكَ قَوْلاً ثَقِيلاً,Verily soon We shall cast on you a weighty an awe-inspiring or stern word a weighty Qur’ān because of the prescriptions imposed in it.
إِنَّ نَاشِئَةَ ٱللَّيْلِ هِيَ أَشَدُّ وَطْأً وَأَقْوَمُ قِيلاً,Assuredly rising in the night to wake up after having been in sleep is firmer in tread more conducive to establishing harmony between the hearing and the heart for the purpose of comprehending the Qur’ān and more upright in respect to speech clearer for utterance of devotions.
إِنَّ لَكَ فِي ٱلنَّهَارِ سَبْحَاً طَوِيلاً,For assuredly during the day you have extended engagements administering your affairs and you do not have the time to recite Qur’ān.
وَٱذْكُرِ ٱسْمَ رَبِّكَ وَتَبَتَّلْ إِلَيْهِ تَبْتِيلاً,And mention the Name of your Lord that is say bi’smi’Llāhi’l-rahmāni’l-rahīm ‘In the Name of God the Compassionate the Merciful’ to begin your recitation and devote yourself exclusively to Him with complete devotion tabtīlan is the verbal noun from batala used here instead of tabattulan in order to concord with the end-rhyme of the verses for he the Prophet is obliged to devote himself to God.
رَّبُّ ٱلْمَشْرِقِ وَٱلْمَغْرِبِ لاَ إِلَـٰهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ فَٱتَّخِذْهُ وَكِيلاً,He is Lord of the east and the west; there is no god except Him so take Him for a Guardian entrusting your affairs to Him
وَٱصْبِرْ عَلَىٰ مَا يَقُولُونَ وَٱهْجُرْهُمْ هَجْراً جَمِيلاً,and bear patiently what they say that is the disbelievers of Mecca in the way of their maltreatment of you and part with them in a gracious manner without any anguish — this was revealed before the command to fight them.
وَذَرْنِي وَٱلْمُكَذِّبِينَ أُوْلِي ٱلنَّعْمَةِ وَمَهِّلْهُمْ قَلِيلاً,And leave Me to deal with the deniers wa’l-mukadhdhibīna is a supplement to the direct object or it is an object of accompaniment; the meaning is ‘I will avail you of them’ they being the doughty leaders of Quraysh those enjoying affluence and respite them a little while — they were killed soon afterwards at Badr.
إِنَّ لَدَيْنَآ أَنكَالاً وَجَحِيماً,For indeed with Us are heavy fetters ankāl is the plural of nikl heavy shackles and a hell-fire a scorching Fire
وَطَعَاماً ذَا غُصَّةٍ وَعَذَاباً أَلِيماً,and a food that chokes one that causes the throat to choke and this is either zaqqūm cf. Q. 4443 darī‘ cf. Q. 886 ghislīn cf. Q. 6936 or thorns of fire which can neither be vomited nor ingested and a painful chastisement in addition to the punishment mentioned for those who deny the Prophet s
يَوْمَ تَرْجُفُ ٱلأَرْضُ وَٱلْجِبَالُ وَكَانَتِ ٱلْجِبَالُ كَثِيباً مَّهِيلاً,on the day when the earth and the mountains will quake and the mountains will be like heaps of shifting sand mahīl derives from hāla yahīlu; it is actually mahyūl but the damma sound is considered too heavy for the yā’ and is therefore transposed onto the hā’ while the wāw the second of two unvocalised consonants is omitted on account of it being extra and the damma is replaced by a kasra because of its phonetic affinity the letter yā’.
إِنَّآ أَرْسَلْنَآ إِلَيْكُمْ رَسُولاً شَاهِداً عَلَيْكُمْ كَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَآ إِلَىٰ فِرْعَوْنَ رَسُولاً,We have indeed sent to you O people of Mecca a Messenger namely Muhammad (s) to be a witness against you on the Day of Resurrection to any disobedience that you engage in just as We sent to Pharaoh a messenger namely Moses peace be upon him.
فَعَصَىٰ فِرْعَوْنُ ٱلرَّسُولَ فَأَخَذْنَاهُ أَخْذاً وَبِيلاً,But Pharaoh disobeyed the messenger so We seized him with a severe seizing.
فَكَيْفَ تَتَّقُونَ إِن كَفَرْتُمْ يَوْماً يَجْعَلُ ٱلْوِلْدَانَ شِيباً,So if you disbelieve in this world how will you guard against a day yawman is the direct object of tattaqūna ‘you guard against’ that is against the chastisement thereof by what defence will you defend yourselves against the chastisement of a day that will make the children grey-haired shīb is the plural of ashyab by the severity of its terrors this being the Day of Resurrection the shīn of shīb should actually have a damma but it is given a kasra because of its phonetic affinity with the yā’ — a distressing day is described as being ‘a day that makes the forelocks of children turn grey’ which is usually understood figuratively; but it may be that in the case of this verse it is meant literally —
ٱلسَّمَآءُ مُنفَطِرٌ بِهِ كَانَ وَعْدُهُ مَفْعُولاً,with the heaven being rent asunder thereon on that Day because of its severity. His promise exalted be He of the coming of that Day shall be fulfilled that is to say it will come to pass without doubt.
إِنَّ هَـٰذِهِ تَذْكِرَةٌ فَمَن شَآءَ ٱتَّخَذَ إِلَىٰ رَبِّهِ سَبِيلاً,Indeed these threatening verses are a reminder an admonition for all creatures. Let him who will then choose a way to his Lord a path to Him through faith and obedience.
إِنَّ رَبَّكَ يَعْلَمُ أَنَّكَ تَقُومُ أَدْنَىٰ مِن ثُلُثَيِ ٱلَّيْلِ وَنِصْفَهُ وَثُلُثَهُ وَطَآئِفَةٌ مِّنَ ٱلَّذِينَ مَعَكَ وَٱللَّهُ يُقَدِّرُ ٱلَّيْلَ وَٱلنَّهَارَ عَلِمَ أَن لَّن تُحْصُوهُ فَتَابَ عَلَيْكُمْ فَٱقْرَءُواْ مَا تَيَسَّرَ مِنَ ٱلْقُرْآنِ عَلِمَ أَن سَيَكُونُ مِنكُمْ مَّرْضَىٰ وَآخَرُونَ يَضْرِبُونَ فِي ٱلأَرْضِ يَبْتَغُونَ مِن فَضْلِ ٱللَّهِ وَآخَرُونَ يُقَٰتِلُونَ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ فَٱقْرَءُواْ مَا تَيَسَّرَ مِنْهُ وَأَقِيمُواْ ٱلصَّلَٰوةَ وَآتُواْ ٱلزَّكَٰوةَ وَأَقْرِضُواْ ٱللَّهَ قَرْضاً حَسَناً وَمَا تُقَدِّمُواْ لأَنفُسِكُمْ مِّنْ خَيْرٍ تَجِدُوهُ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ هُوَ خَيْراً وَأَعْظَمَ أَجْراً وَٱسْتَغْفِرُواْ ٱللَّهَ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ,Assuredly your Lord knows that you stand vigil less than two thirds of the night or at times a half of it or a third of it if read wa-nisfihi wa-thuluthihi then these constitute a supplement to thuluthay ‘two thirds’; if read wa-nisfahu wa-thuluthahu then a supplement to adnā ‘less than’ — his keeping vigil in the way mentioned is in accordance with what was enjoined on him at the beginning of this sūra — along with a group of those with you wa-tā’ifatun mina’lladhīna ma‘aka constitutes a supplement to the subject of the verb taqūmu ‘you stand vigil’ but it may also constitute although it is not certain a separating clause. The keeping vigil by some of his companions in this way indicates their emulation of him. Some of them could not tell how much of the night they had spent in prayer and how much of it had remained and would therefore keep vigil all night as a precaution; and so they used to keep vigil in this way for a whole year or more with their feet swollen until God alleviated matters for them. He exalted be He says and God keeps measures He keeps count of the night and the day. He knows that an softened in place of the hardened form its subject having been omitted that is to say annahu you will not be able to keep count of it that is the length of the night so that you may perform the vigil at the time in which it is required unless you stay up all night which is hard on you and so He has relented to you making you revert to what is easier. So recite as much as is feasible of the Qur’ān during prayer by performing as much prayer as is feasible. He knows that an softened in place of the hardened form that is to say annahu some of you will be sick while others will be travelling in the land seeking the bounty of God seeking of His provision through commerce and otherwise and others will be fighting in the way of God for each of the three groups mentioned the keeping of nightly vigil is hard and so God has alleviated things for them by enjoining on them what is feasible.
يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلْمُدَّثِّرُ,O you enveloped in your mantle the Prophet s al-muddaththir is actually al-mutadaththir but the tā’ has been assimilated with the dāl that is to say the one who is enwrapped in his clothes when the Revelation Gabriel comes down on him
قُمْ فَأَنذِرْ,arise and warn threaten the people of Mecca with punishment in the Fire should they refuse to believe;
وَرَبَّكَ فَكَبِّرْ,and magnify your Lord exalt Him above what is ascribed to Him by the idolaters;
وَثِيَابَكَ فَطَهِّرْ,and purify your clothes from impurity or it means shorten them instead of imitating the way in which the Arabs are wont to let their robes drag behind them out of vanity for perhaps they will be sullied by some impurity;
وَٱلرُّجْزَ فَٱهْجُرْ,and shun all defilement this rijz was explained by the Prophet s to be the graven images; in other words persist in shunning them.
وَلاَ تَمْنُن تَسْتَكْثِرُ,And do not grant a favour seeking greater gain read tastakthiru as a circumstantial qualifier in other words do not give something in order to demand more in return this stipulation is specific to the Prophet s since he is enjoined to adopt the fairest traits and the noblest of manners;
وَلِرَبِّكَ فَٱصْبِرْ,and endure patiently for the sake of your Lord all His commands and prohibitions.
فَإِذَا نُقِرَ فِي ٱلنَّاقُورِ,For when the trumpet is sounded when the trumpet is blown that is the Horn qarn at the second blast
فَذَلِكَ يَوْمَئِذٍ يَوْمٌ عَسِيرٌ,that day that is to say the time of the sounding yawma’idhin is a substitution for the preceding subject and is not declined because it is annexed to something that cannot be declined; the predicate of the subject is the following will be a harsh day idhā is operated by what is indicated by the statement ishtadda’l-amru ‘for when the trumpet is sounded the situation will be terrible’
عَلَى ٱلْكَافِرِينَ غَيْرُ يَسِيرٍ,for the disbelievers not at all easy herein is an indication that it will be easy for believers despite its harshness.
ذَرْنِي وَمَنْ خَلَقْتُ وَحِيداً,Leave Me to deal with him whom I created wa-man khalaqtu is a supplement to the direct object or it is an object of accompaniment lonely wahīdan is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the man ‘whom’ or to the pronoun referring to it but omitted from khalaqtu sc. khalaqtuhu alone without family or wealth — this was al-Walīd b. al-Mughīra al-Makhzūmī —
وَجَعَلْتُ لَهُ مَالاً مَّمْدُوداً,and then assigned him ample means abundant and continuous generated from his crops livestock and commerce
وَبَنِينَ شُهُوداً,and sons ten or more present by his side present at social gatherings and whose testimonies are listened to
وَمَهَّدتُّ لَهُ تَمْهِيداً,and facilitated extended for him greatly his livelihood duration of life and children.
ثُمَّ يَطْمَعُ أَنْ أَزِيدَ,Still he is eager that I should give him more.
كَلاَّ إِنَّهُ كان لآيَاتِنَا عَنِيداً,Nay! I shall not give him more than that. He is indeed stubborn to Our signs to the Qur’ān.
سَأُرْهِقُهُ صَعُوداً,Soon I shall burden him with a trying chastisement; alternatively sa‘ūdan means a mountain of fire which he will be made to ascend and then fall down from forever.
إِنَّهُ فَكَّرَ وَقَدَّرَ,Indeed he pondered what to say about the Qur’ān which he heard from the Prophet s and decided this in his mind.
فَقُتِلَ كَيْفَ قَدَّرَ,Perish he may he be cursed and chastised how he decided! perish he whatever the nature of his decision may have been.
ثُمَّ قُتِلَ كَيْفَ قَدَّرَ,Again perish he how he decided!
ثُمَّ نَظَرَ,Then he contemplated the faces of his people; or he contemplated with what words he might cast aspersions upon it.
ثُمَّ عَبَسَ وَبَسَرَ,Then he frowned he contracted his face and glowered anguished by what he wanted to say and scowled increasing the contracting and the glowering in his face.
ثُمَّ أَدْبَرَ وَٱسْتَكْبَرَ,Then he turned his back to faith in disdain scornful of following the Prophet s
فَقَالَ إِنْ هَـٰذَآ إِلاَّ سِحْرٌ يُؤْثَرُ,and said of what he the Prophet had brought ‘This is nothing but handed-down sorcery learnt from sorcerers;
إِنْ هَـٰذَآ إِلاَّ قَوْلُ ٱلْبَشَرِ,this is nothing but the speech of humans’ similar to what they the idolaters had said ‘It is only a human that is teaching him’ Q. 16103.
سَأُصْلِيهِ سَقَرَ,I shall soon admit him into Saqar! — Hell.
وَمَآ أَدْرَاكَ مَا سَقَرُ,And how would you know what is Saqar? — this interrogative is intended to emphasise its enormity.
لاَ تُبْقِي وَلاَ تَذَرُ,It neither spares nor leaves behind anything of flesh or nerve but destroys it all after which he is restored to his former state.
لَوَّاحَةٌ لِّلْبَشَرِ,It burns away the flesh scorching the surface of skin.
عَلَيْهَا تِسْعَةَ عَشَرَ,There are nineteen keepers standing over it angels its keepers; a certain disbeliever who was a mighty stalwart said ‘I will avail you seventeen of them if you avail me just two’. God exalted be He says
وَمَا جَعَلْنَآ أَصْحَٰبَ ٱلنَّارِ إِلاَّ مَلَٰئِكَةً وَمَا جَعَلْنَا عِدَّتَهُمْ إِلاَّ فِتْنَةً لِّلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لِيَسْتَيْقِنَ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ وَيَزْدَادَ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوۤاْ إِيمَٰناً وَلاَ يَرْتَابَ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ وَٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ وَلِيَقُولَ ٱلَّذِينَ فِي قُلُوبِهِم مَّرَضٌ وَٱلْكَٰفِرُونَ مَاذَآ أَرَادَ ٱللَّهُ بِهَـٰذَا مَثَلاً كَذَلِكَ يُضِلُّ ٱللَّهُ مَن يَشَآءُ وَيَهْدِي مَن يَشَآءُ وَمَا يَعْلَمُ جُنُودَ رَبِّكَ إِلاَّ هُوَ وَمَا هِيَ إِلاَّ ذِكْرَىٰ لِلْبَشَرِ,And We have appointed only angels as wardens of the Fire in other words and so they cannot be withstood as these disbelievers are wont to imagine; and We have made their number so only as a stumbling-block a cause for error for those who disbelieve when they then say ‘Why are there nineteen of them?’ so that those who were given the Scripture namely the Jews may be certain of the sincerity of the Prophet s in saying that they are nineteen for this concords with what is in their Scripture; and that those who believe from among the People of the Scripture may increase in faith in affirmation of the truth given that what the Prophet s has said concords with what is in their Scripture and that those given the Scripture and the believers those other than these Jews may not be in doubt concerning the number of these angels and that those in whose hearts there is a sickness an uncertainty those in Medina and the disbelievers in Mecca may say ‘What did God mean by this number as a similitude?’ mathalan they referred to it thus as a mathal on account of it being a curious matter; in terms of syntax it mathalan is a circumstantial qualifier. Thus that is just as the one who rejects this number is led astray and the one who affirms the truth of it is guided God leads astray whom He will and guides whom He will. And none knows the hosts of your Lord namely the angels none knows them in terms of their strength and their assistants except Him. And it that is Saqar is nothing but a reminder for humans.
كَلاَّ وَٱلْقَمَرِ,Nay kallā denoting a commencement of a new sentence to be understood as alā by the moon!
وَٱللَّيْلِ إِذْ أَدْبَرَ,And by the night when it returns! if read as idhā dabara when it comes back after day a variant reading has idh adbara meaning ‘when it has receded’.
وَٱلصُّبْحِ إِذَآ أَسْفَرَ,And by the dawn when it appears!
إِنَّهَا لإِحْدَى ٱلْكُبَرِ,Verily it that is Saqar is one of the enormities one of the greatest calamities —
نَذِيراً لِّلْبَشَرِ,a warning nadhīran is a circumstantial qualifier referring to ihdā ‘one of’ and it is masculine because it denotes masculine ‘adhāb ‘chastisement’ to all humans;
لِمَن شَآءَ مِنكُمْ أَن يَتَقَدَّمَ أَوْ يَتَأَخَّرَ,alike to those of you who wish li-man shā’a minkum is a substitution for li’l-bashar ‘to all humans’ to advance towards good or towards Paradise by means of faith or linger behind in evil or in Hell because of their disbelief.
كُلُّ نَفْسٍ بِمَا كَسَبَتْ رَهِينَةٌ,Every soul is held to ransom by what it earns it is ransomed and requited for its deeds with the Fire
إِلاَّ أَصْحَابَ ٱلْيَمِينِ,except those of the right hand namely the believers who will be saved from it and who will be
فِي جَنَّاتٍ يَتَسَآءَلُونَ,in gardens questioning one another
عَنِ ٱلْمُجْرِمِينَ,about the guilty and their predicament; and they will say to them after all those who believed in the One God muwahhidūn are brought out of the Fire
مَا سَلَكَكُمْ فِي سَقَرَ,‘What has landed you in what has made you enter Saqar?’
قَالُواْ لَمْ نَكُ مِنَ ٱلْمُصَلِّينَ,They will say ‘We were not of those who prayed.
وَلَمْ نَكُ نُطْعِمُ ٱلْمِسْكِينَ,Nor did we ever feed the needy.
وَكُنَّا نَخُوضُ مَعَ ٱلُخَآئِضِينَ,And we used to delve into falsehood along with those who delved
وَكُنَّا نُكَذِّبُ بِيَوْمِ ٱلدِّينِ,and we used to deny the Day of Judgement the Day of Resurrection and Requital
حَتَّىٰ أَتَانَا ٱلْيَقِينُ,until finally the inevitable came to us’ — death.
فَمَا تَنفَعُهُمْ شَفَاعَةُ ٱلشَّافِعِينَ,Thus the intercession of the intercessors from among the angels the prophets and the righteous will not avail them in other words there will be no intercession for them.
فَمَا لَهُمْ عَنِ ٱلتَّذْكِرَةِ مُعْرِضِينَ,So what fa-mā the subject is wrong with them lahum the predicate thereof semantically connected to an omitted clause the person of which has been transposed onto it that they turn away mu‘ridīna is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the suffixed pronoun in lahum ‘them’ from the Reminder — in other words ‘what has happened to them that they have turned away from admonition’ —
كَأَنَّهُمْ حُمُرٌ مُّسْتَنفِرَةٌ,as if they were wild asses
فَرَّتْ مِن قَسْوَرَةٍ,fleeing from a lion? that is to say fleeing from it with absolute fright.
بَلْ يُرِيدُ كُلُّ ٱمْرِىءٍ مِّنْهُمْ أَن يُؤْتَىٰ صُحُفاً مُّنَشَّرَةً,Nay but everyone of them desires to be given unrolled scrolls from God exalted be He enjoining them to follow the Prophet s as they said before ‘And even then we will not believe your ascension until you bring down for us a book that we may read’ Q. 1793.
كَلاَّ بَل لاَّ يَخَافُونَ ٱلآخِرَةَ,No indeed! kallā a deterrent of what they desire. Rather they do not fear the Hereafter that is the chastisement thereof.
كَلاَّ إِنَّهُ تَذْكِرَةٌ,No indeed! kallā a commencement of a new sentence Assuredly it that is the Qur’ān is a Reminder an admonition.
فَمَن شَآءَ ذَكَرَهُ,So whoever wills shall remember it he shall read it and be admonished by it.
وَمَا يَذْكُرُونَ إِلاَّ أَن يَشَآءَ ٱللَّهُ هُوَ أَهْلُ ٱلتَّقْوَىٰ وَأَهْلُ ٱلْمَغْفِرَةِ,And they will not remember yadhkurūna or read second person plural tadhkurūna unless God wills it. He is the One worthy of your fear and the One worthy to forgive by forgiving those who fear Him.
لاَ أُقْسِمُ بِيَوْمِ ٱلْقِيَامَةِ,Nay! the lā is extra in both instances I swear by the Day of Resurrection.
وَلاَ أُقْسِمُ بِٱلنَّفْسِ ٱللَّوَّامَةِ,And nay I swear by the self-reproaching soul the one that reproaches itself even if it should expend great effort in being virtuous the response to the oath has been omitted that is to say la-tub‘athunna ‘you shall indeed be resurrected!’ as indicated by what follows

بَلَىٰ قَادِرِينَ عَلَىٰ أَن نُّسَوِّيَ بَنَانَهُ,Yes indeed! We shall assemble them. We are able in addition to assembling them to reshape even his fingers that is to say to restore their bones just as they had been despite their smallness so how much more so are We able to restore the larger ones!

Surely enough God exalted be He seized them at Badr and abrogated the dispensation of ‘granting respite’ by the ‘sword’ verse in other words by the command to fight and struggle.

وَإِلَى ٱلأَرْضِ كَيْفَ سُطِحَتْ,And the earth how it was laid out flat? and thus infer from this the power of God exalted be He and His Oneness? The commencing with the mention of camels is because they are closer in contact with it the earth than any other animal. As for His words sutihat ‘laid out flat’ this on a literal reading suggests that the earth is flat which is the opinion of most of the scholars of the revealed Law and not a sphere as astronomers ahl al-hay’a have it even if this latter does not contradict any of the pillars of the Law.

أَلَمْ تَرَ كَيْفَ فَعَلَ رَبُّكَ بِعَادٍ,Have you not seen do you not know O Muhammad (s) how your Lord dealt with ‘Ād
إِرَمَ ذَاتِ ٱلْعِمَادِ,Iram — these were the former people of ‘Ād Irama is an explicative supplement or a substitution and it is treated as a diptote because it is a proper noun and feminine — of the towering ones that is to say the tall ones — the tallest one among them would reach four hundred cubits —
ٱلَّتِي لَمْ يُخْلَقْ مِثْلُهَا فِي ٱلْبِلاَدِ,the like of which was not created in the land in terms of their power of assault and strength

فَأَكْثَرُواْ فِيهَا ٱلْفَسَادَ,and caused much corruption therein? by way of slaying and otherwise.

وَأَمَّآ إِذَا مَا ٱبْتَلاَهُ فَقَدَرَ عَلَيْهِ رِزْقَهُ فَيَقُولُ رَبِّيۤ أَهَانَنِ,But when he tests him and restricts his provision for him he says ‘My Lord has humiliated me’.
كَلاَّ بَل لاَّ تُكْرِمُونَ ٱلْيَتِيمَ,No indeed! — a disavowal of this notion in other words honour is not about wealth nor is there any humiliation in poverty rather it has to do with obedience and disobedience respectively; but the disbelievers of Mecca unmindful of this. Rather they do not honour the orphan they do not treat him with kindness despite their wealth or it means that they do not give him what is his due from an inheritance
وَلاَ تَحَآضُّونَ عَلَىٰ طَعَامِ ٱلْمِسْكِينِ,and they do not urge neither themselves nor others the feeding of the needy;

يَقُولُ يٰلَيْتَنِي قَدَّمْتُ لِحَيَاتِي,He will say as he remembers ‘O yā is for calling attention to something would that I had sent ahead good deeds and faith for my life!’ for a good life in the Hereafter or it means ‘during my life’ in the world.

وَلاَ يُوثِقُ وَثَاقَهُ أَحَدٌ,and likewise none shall bind read yūthiqu His bind a variant reading has yu‘adhdhabu ‘none shall be chastised’ and yūthaqu ‘none shall be bound’ so that the suffixed pronoun of ‘adhābahu and wathāqahu refers to the chastisement and the binds of the disbeliever the meaning then being ‘none shall be chastised as he shall and none shall be bound as he shall be bound’.
يٰأَيَّتُهَا ٱلنَّفْسُ ٱلْمُطْمَئِنَّةُ,‘O soul at peace! the one secure namely the believing one.
ٱرْجِعِي إِلَىٰ رَبِّكِ رَاضِيَةً مَّرْضِيَّةً,Return — this is said to it upon death — to your Lord that is to say return to His command and to His will pleased with the reward pleasing in God’s sight with your deeds; in other words return O soul combining both descriptions both of which are circumstantial qualifiers.

وَأَنتَ حِلٌّ بِهَـٰذَا ٱلْبَلَدِ,and you O Muhammad (s) have free disposal of sanction for this land in that you will be given permission to fight in it — and indeed God fulfilled this promise to him on the day of the Conquest of Mecca thus this is a parenthetical statement intervening between that by which the oath has been sworn and that which is a supplement thereto.
وَوَالِدٍ وَمَا وَلَدَ,And by the begetter that is Adam and that which he begat that is his descendants mā ‘that which’ actually means man ‘whom’.

Kalada presume on account of his strength that an softened in place of the hardened form its subject omitted that is to say annahu no one will have power over him? Yet God has power over him.

أَيَحْسَبُ أَن لَّمْ يَرَهُ أَحَدٌ,Does he suppose that an in other words annahu no one has seen him? with regard to what he has expended to know the quantity thereof; God knows the quantity thereof; but it is not in reality that much so as to be considered a great amount and in any case He will requite him for his evil conduct.
أَلَمْ نَجْعَل لَّهُ عَيْنَيْنِ,Have We not given an interrogative meant as an affirmative in other words ‘We have certainly given’ him two eyes
وَلِسَاناً وَشَفَتَيْنِ,and a tongue and two lips

أَوْ مِسْكِيناً ذَا مَتْرَبَةٍ,or a needy person in misery matraba literally means ‘clinging to the dust turāb’ because of his poverty; a variant reading has two verbal nouns in place of the two verbs fakka ‘he freed’ and at‘ama ‘he fed’ the first being in a genitive construction fakku raqabatin ‘the freeing of a slave’ and the second with nunation it‘āmun ‘to give food’ in which case there is an implied iqtihāmu before al-‘aqaba of which the said reading becomes the explication;
ثُمَّ كَانَ مِنَ ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ وَتَوَاصَوْاْ بِٱلصَّبْرِ وَتَوَاصَوْاْ بِٱلْمَرْحَمَةِ,while being thumma kāna is a supplement to iqtahama ‘he assaulted’; thumma is for the ordering of things to be mentioned in other words what is meant is that at the point of the assault he was one of those who believe and enjoin one another to steadfastness in pursuing obedience and in refraining from disobedience and enjoin one another to compassion marhama means rahma towards creatures.

وَٱللَّيْلِ إِذَا يَغْشَاهَا,and by the night when it enshrouds her covering her up with its darkness idhā ‘when’ in all three instances is an absolute adverbial operated by the verbal action of the oath.
وَٱلسَّمَآءِ وَمَا بَنَاهَا,By the heaven and the One Who built it
وَٱلأَرْضِ وَمَا طَحَاهَا,and by the earth and the One Who spread it laid out flat.

قَدْ أَفْلَحَ مَن زَكَّاهَا,Successful indeed qad the lām of laqad ‘indeed’ has been omitted from it for the sake of brevity will be the one who purifies it purges it of sins
وَقَدْ خَابَ مَن دَسَّاهَا,and he will indeed have failed he who eclipses it he who obscures it with acts of disobedience dassāhā is actually dassasahā but the second sīn has been replaced with an alif for phonetic ease.
كَذَّبَتْ ثَمُودُ بِطَغْوَاهَآ,Thamūd denied their messenger Sālih because of their rebellious nature
إِذِ ٱنبَعَثَ أَشْقَاهَا,when the most wretched of them whose name was Qudār was dispatched when he hastened in order to hamstring the she-camel with their approval.
فَقَالَ لَهُمْ رَسُولُ ٱللَّهِ نَاقَةَ ٱللَّهِ وَسُقْيَاهَا,But then the messenger of God Sālih said to them ‘This is the she-camel of God so let her have her drink!’ her drink on her day — one day was hers the next theirs.
فَكَذَّبُوهُ فَعَقَرُوهَا فَدَمْدَمَ عَلَيْهِمْ رَبُّهُمْ بِذَنبِهِمْ فَسَوَّاهَا,But they denied him with regard to his saying this as being a command from God — which if they contravened would immediately result in chastisement being sent down on them — then hamstrung her they slew it in order to appropriate her share of the drinking water. So their Lord closed in on them the chastisement because of their sin and meted it equally among them that is the closing in on them in other words He subsumed them all by it so that not one of them escaped.
وَلاَ يَخَافُ عُقْبَاهَا,And He does not read wa-lā or fa-lā fear the consequence of it.
وَٱلْلَّيْلِ إِذَا يَغْشَىٰ,By the night as it enshrouds with its darkness all that is between the heaven and the earth
وَٱلنَّهَارِ إِذَا تَجَلَّىٰ,and by the day as it unveils as it is revealed and becomes manifest idhā ‘as’ in both instances is an absolute adverbial operated by the verbal action of the oath

إِنَّ سَعْيَكُمْ لَشَتَّىٰ,Assuredly your efforts your deeds are dissimilar with some working towards Paradise by means of obedience while others in effect are working towards the Fire through acts of disobedience.

وَصَدَّقَ بِٱلْحُسْنَىٰ,and affirms the truth of the best word that is the truth of ‘there is no god but God’ in both places here and below verse 9
فَسَنُيَسِّرُهُ لِلْيُسْرَىٰ,We shall surely ease his way to the abode of ease to Paradise.

فَأَنذَرْتُكُمْ نَاراً تَلَظَّىٰ,So I have warned you of I have threatened you O people of Mecca with a raging fire talazzā ‘raging’ one of the two original tā’ letters of tatalazzā has been omitted; a variant reading retains it tatalazzā that is ‘one that is flaming’
لاَ يَصْلَٰهَآ إِلاَّ ٱلأَشْقَى,which none shall enter but the wretched one al-ashqā means al-shaqī
ٱلَّذِي كَذَّبَ وَتَوَلَّىٰ,he who denies the Prophet and turns away from faith — this delimiting of those who deserve to enter this fire constitutes an interpretation of His saying But He forgives other than that to whomever He will Q. 448 which in turn suggests that what is meant is that entry into the Fire which will be everlasting.
وَسَيُجَنَّبُهَا ٱلأَتْقَى,The God-fearing one al-atqā means al-taqī shall be spared it he will be removed far away from it
ٱلَّذِى يُؤْتِي مَالَهُ يَتَزَكَّىٰ,he who gives his wealth to purify himself offering it as a means of self purification before God exalted be He by making this payment for the sake of God exalted be He and not for show or the sake of reputation so that he or the offering stands purified in the sight of God. This verse was revealed regarding the truthful one al-siddīq Abū Bakr may God be pleased with him when he purchased Bilāl the Ethiopian who was being tortured on account of his faith and then freed him whereat the disbelievers said ‘He only did this in return for a favour which he must have owed him’ and so the following was revealed
وَمَا لأَحَدٍ عِندَهُ مِن نِّعْمَةٍ تُجْزَىٰ,and no one has any favour outstanding with him that must be requited;
إِلاَّ ٱبْتِغَآءَ وَجْهِ رَبِّهِ ٱلأَعْلَىٰ,but he did this only seeking the pleasure of his Lord the Most High that is to say only seeking to secure God’s reward;
وَلَسَوْفَ يَرْضَىٰ,and verily soon he shall himself be pleased with the reward he will be given in Paradise. The verse applies equally to anyone who may do as he Abū Bakr did may God be pleased with him and such a person will thereby be removed far from the Fire and rewarded.
وَٱلضُّحَىٰ,By the forenoon that is to say the first part of the day or all of it
وَٱللَّيْلِ إِذَا سَجَىٰ,and by the night when it is still — or sajā can mean ‘when it envelops all in its darkness’.
مَا وَدَّعَكَ رَبُّكَ وَمَا قَلَىٰ,Your Lord has neither forsaken you He has not abandoned you O Muhammad (s) nor does He hate you this was revealed when after the revelation had not come to him for fifteen days the disbelievers said ‘His Lord has parted with him and hates him’.
وَلَلآخِرَةُ خَيْرٌ لَّكَ مِنَ ٱلأُولَىٰ,And verily the Hereafter shall be better for you by virtue of the honours awaiting you thereat than the first life this world.
وَلَسَوْفَ يُعْطِيكَ رَبُّكَ فَتَرْضَىٰ,And verily your Lord shall give you in the Hereafter of good things a bounteous gift and you shall be satisfied with it — and so the Prophet s said ‘In that case I shall not be satisfied if a single person from among my community remains in the Fire’ the response to the oath terminates here with two affirmations and two negations.
أَلَمْ يَجِدْكَ يَتِيماً فَآوَىٰ,Did He not find you an orphan an interrogative meant as an affirmative in other words He did indeed find you an orphan having lost your father before you were born or shortly thereafter and shelter you? by having your uncle Abū Tālib embrace you as part of his household.
وَوَجَدَكَ ضَآلاًّ فَهَدَىٰ,And did He not find you erring from the revealed Law which you now follow and guided you? that is and then guided you to it.
وَوَجَدَكَ عَآئِلاً فَأَغْنَىٰ,And did He not find you needy poor and enrich you? and made you content with the spoils and other things which He gave you — in a hadīth it is stated ‘Wealth comes not from the proliferation of transient worldly goods but wealth comes from the contentedness of the soul’.
فَأَمَّا ٱلْيَتِيمَ فَلاَ تَقْهَرْ,So as for the orphan do not oppress him by appropriating his wealth or otherwise
وَأَمَّا ٱلسَّآئِلَ فَلاَ تَنْهَرْ,and as for the beggar do not drive him away do not repel him on account of his poverty
وَأَمَّا بِنِعْمَةِ رَبِّكَ فَحَدِّثْ,and as for your Lord’s grace to you by way of prophethood and otherwise proclaim it make it known. The omission in certain instances of the suffixed pronoun referring to the Prophet s from the end of the verbs is intended to sustain the end-rhyme of the verses.
أَلَمْ نَشْرَحْ لَكَ صَدْرَكَ,Did We not expand an interrogative meant as an affirmative in other words ‘We did indeed expand’ your breast for you O Muhammad (s) by means of prophethood and otherwise
وَوَضَعْنَا عَنكَ وِزْرَكَ,and relieve you of your burden
ٱلَّذِيۤ أَنقَضَ ظَهْرَكَ,that which weighed down your back? — this is similar to where God says that God may forgive you what is past of your sin Q. 482.
وَرَفَعْنَا لَكَ ذِكْرَكَ,Did We not exalt your mention? For you are mentioned where I God am mentioned in the call announcing the time for prayer adhān in the second call to perform the prayer iqāma in the witnessing ‘there is no god but God Muhammad is His Messenger’ tashahhud in the Friday sermon and in other instances.

إِنَّ مَعَ ٱلْعُسْرِ يُسْراً,Truly with hardship comes ease the Prophet s suffered much hardship at the hands of the disbelievers but then he enjoyed ease when he was assisted to victory by God over them.
فَإِذَا فَرَغْتَ فَٱنصَبْ,So when you are finished from performing prayer toil exert yourself in supplication to God
وَإِلَىٰ رَبِّكَ فَٱرْغَبْ,and seek devote yourself humbly to your Lord.
وَٱلتِّينِ وَٱلزَّيْتُونِ,By the fig and the olive that is the two edible foods — or these denote the names of two mountains in Syria on which these two foods grow —

لَقَدْ خَلَقْنَا ٱلإِنسَانَ فِيۤ أَحْسَنِ تَقْوِيمٍ,Verily We created man al-insān the generic in the best of forms in the best proportioning of his shape.
ثُمَّ رَدَدْنَاهُ أَسْفَلَ سَافِلِينَ,Then in the case of certain individuals of his species We reduced him to the lowest of the low — a metaphor for old age and weakness at which point a believer’s deeds are fewer than when he was young; but he will still have his reward as God exalted be He says

فَمَا يُكَذِّبُكَ بَعْدُ بِٱلدِّينِ,So what makes you deny O disbeliever thereafter — after the mention of man being created in the best of forms and his being reduced to the vilest of age all of which indicates the power of God to resurrect — the Judgement? the Requital that will be preceded by the Resurrection and the Reckoning. In other words what makes you disbelieve in all this? Nothing does!
أَلَيْسَ ٱللَّهُ بِأَحْكَمِ ٱلْحَاكِمِينَ,Is not God the fairest of all judges? the most just of all judges. His passing judgement by means of the process of requital is one such example. In a hadīth it is stated ‘Whoever recites sūrat wa’l-tīni ‘By the fig’ to the end of it let him then say “Yes Indeed! And I am of those who bear witness to this!” ’
ٱقْرَأْ بِٱسْمِ رَبِّكَ ٱلَّذِي خَلَقَ,Recite bring recitation into existence beginning with In the Name of your Lord Who created all creatures;

إِنَّهَا عَلَيْهِم مُّؤْصَدَةٌ,Lo! it will be closed in mu’sada or mūsada on them ‘alayhim ‘on them’ the plural pronoun takes into account the plural import of kull ‘every’

أَلَمْ تَرَ كَيْفَ فَعَلَ رَبُّكَ بِأَصْحَابِ ٱلْفِيلِ,Have you not considered an interrogative meant to provoke marvel in other words ‘marvel at’ the way in which your Lord dealt with the Men of the Elephant? who was named Mahmūd and the men were Abraha King of Yemen and his troops. He had built a church in San‘ā’ in order to divert pilgrims away from Mecca to it. A man from among the Banū Kināna defecated in it and stained its prayer niche with a deflowered virgin’s blood in contempt of it. Abraha then swore that he would knock down the Ka‘ba. So he approached Mecca with his troops riding Yemeni elephants with Mahmūd at the vanguard. But when they turned to destroy the Ka‘ba God unleashed upon them what He relates in His words
أَلَمْ يَجْعَلْ كَيْدَهُمْ فِي تَضْلِيلٍ,Did He not make — that is to say He did indeed make — their stratagem to destroy the Ka‘ba go astray ending up in failure and destruction

تَرْمِيهِم بِحِجَارَةٍ مِّن سِجِّيلٍ,pelting them with stones of baked clay
فَجَعَلَهُمْ كَعَصْفٍ مَّأْكُولٍ,thus making them like devoured blades? like the leaves of crops which have been consumed trampled and destroyed by animals. God destroyed each one of them with his own stone inscribed with his name larger than a lentil in size but smaller than a chick-pea able to pierce through an egg a man or an elephant and go through the ground. This took place in the year of the Prophet’s birth s.

إِيلاَفِهِمْ رِحْلَةَ ٱلشِّتَآءِ وَٱلصَّيْفِ,their security īlāfihim repeated for emphasis; it is a verbal noun from the verb ālafa for the journey of winter to Yemen and the journey of summer to Syria every year they made use of these two journeys to provide for their trade at the station of Abraham in Mecca in order to attend to the House of God which was their source of pride; they Quraysh were the descendants of al-Nadr b. Kināna;
فَلْيَعْبُدُواْ رَبَّ هَـٰذَا ٱلْبَيْتِ,let them worship fa’l-ya‘budū is semantically connected to li-ilāfi ‘for the security’ the fā’ being extra the Lord of this House

لَكُمْ دِينُكُمْ وَلِيَ دِينِ,You have your religion idolatry and I have a religion’ Islam this was revealed before he was commanded to wage war against the idolaters all seven Qur’ānic readers omit the yā’ of the genitive possessive construction in wa-liya dīni whether with a pause or without; Ya‘qūb however retains it in both cases.
إِذَا جَآءَ نَصْرُ ٱللَّهِ وَٱلْفَتْحُ,When the help of God for His Prophet s against his enemies comes together with victory the victory over Mecca
وَرَأَيْتَ ٱلنَّاسَ يَدْخُلُونَ فِي دِينِ ٱللَّهِ أَفْوَاجاً,and you see people entering God’s religion that is to say Islam in throngs in large droves after they had been entering one by one — this was after the conquest of Mecca when the Arabs from all corners of the land came to him willingly in obedience to his command —
فَسَبِّحْ بِحَمْدِ رَبِّكَ وَٱسْتَغْفِرْهُ إِنَّهُ كَانَ تَوَّاباً,then glorify with praise of your Lord that is continuously praising Him and seek forgiveness from Him; for verily He is ever ready to relent. The Prophet s after this sūra had been revealed would frequently repeat the words subhāna’Llāhi wa bi-hamdihi ‘Glory and praise be to God’ and astaghfiru’Llāha wa-atūbu ilayhi ‘I seek forgiveness from God and I repent to Him’; with the revelation of this final sūra he realised that his end was near. The victory over Mecca was in Ramadān of year 8; the Prophet s passed away in Rabī‘ I of the year 10.
تَبَّتْ يَدَآ أَبِي لَهَبٍ وَتَبَّ,Perish ruined be the hands of Abū Lahab in other words all of him — the use of ‘hands’ here to denote all of him is figurative and is because most actions are performed by them; the statement is an invocation — and perish he! may he be ruined! this tabba is a predicate as where one says ahlakahu’Llāhu wa-qad halak ‘God destroyed him and he indeed is destroyed’. When the Prophet threatened him with the chastisement he said ‘If what my brother’s son says is true then I shall ransom myself from it with my wealth and sons!’; so the following was revealed
مَآ أَغْنَىٰ عَنْهُ مَالُهُ وَمَا كَسَبَ,His wealth will not avail him nor what he has earned wa-kasab means wa-kasbihi that is to say his sons; mā aghnā means mā yughnī.
سَيَصْلَىٰ نَاراً ذَاتَ لَهَبٍ,He will soon enter a Fire of flames that is to say a fire that is flaming and ignited this statement is the source of his nickname which was given to him on account of his flaming reddish fair face
وَٱمْرَأَتُهُ حَمَّالَةَ ٱلْحَطَبِ,and his wife wa’mra’atuhu is a supplement to the person of the verb yaslā ‘he will enter’ separated by the clause of the direct object and its qualification — and this was Umm Jamīl — the carrier read hammālatu or hammālata of firewood cactus and thorns which she used to fling into the path of the Prophet s.
فِي جِيدِهَا حَبْلٌ مِّن مَّسَدٍ,with a rope of palm-fibre around her neck fī jīdihā hablun min masadin is a circumstantial qualifier referring to hammālata’l-hatab which in turn is either a description of imra’atahu ‘his wife’ or the predicate of an implied subject.
قُلْ هُوَ ٱللَّهُ أَحَدٌ,Say ‘He is God One Allāhu is the predicate of huwa ‘He is’ and ahadun is its substitution or a second predicate.
ٱللَّهُ ٱلصَّمَدُ,God the Self-Sufficient Besought of all Allāhu’l-samad constitute a subject and a predicate al-samad means the One Who is always sought at times of need

وَلَمْ يَكُنْ لَّهُ كُفُواً أَحَدٌ,Nor is there anyone equal to Him’ neither match nor comparison lahu ‘to Him’ is semantically connected to kufuwan ‘equal’ but precedes it because it is the object of the intended negation; ahadun ‘anyone’ which is the subject of yakun ‘is there’ has been placed after the predicate of the latter kufuwan ‘equal’ in order to retain the harmony of the end-rhyme of the verses.
قُلْ أَعُوذُ بِرَبِّ ٱلْفَلَقِ,Say ‘I seek refuge in the Lord of the Daybreak the morning
مِن شَرِّ مَا خَلَقَ,from the evil of what He has created of obligated animate beings and non-obligated ones and from all inanimates such as poison and so on;
وَمِن شَرِّ غَاسِقٍ إِذَا وَقَبَ,and from the evil of darkness when it gathers that is from night when it becomes dark and the moon when it is absent
وَمِن شَرِّ ٱلنَّفَّاثَاتِ فِي ٱلْعُقَدِ,and from the evil of the women-blowers sorceresses who blow on knots which they knot into strings blowing into them certain words but without spittle; however al-Zamakhsharī says ‘with this spittle’ — sorceresses such as the daughters of the said Labīd —
وَمِن شَرِّ حَاسِدٍ إِذَا حَسَدَ,and from the evil of an envier when he envies’ when he manifests his envy and behaves in accordance with it — such as the mentioned Labīd from among the Jews who were envious of the Prophet s; the mention of these three elements of evil which are already subsumed by the statement ‘of what He has created’ is because of the severity of their evil.
قُلْ أَعُوذُ بِرَبِّ ٱلنَّاسِ,Say ‘I seek refuge in the Lord of mankind their Creator and their Possessor they mankind have been singled out for mention here in order to honour them and a preface to seeking refuge from the evil of the one who whispers in their hearts;
مَلِكِ ٱلنَّاسِ,the King of mankind
إِلَـٰهِ ٱلنَّاسِ,the God of mankind both maliki’l-nās and ilāhi’l-nās are either substitutions or adjectival qualifications or explicative supplements; the repetition of the annexed word al-nās is meant as an additional explication
مِن شَرِّ ٱلْوَسْوَاسِ ٱلْخَنَّاسِ,from the evil of the slinking whisperer Satan — he is referred to by the name of the action waswasa on account of his repeated engaging in it — who slinks away and recoils from the heart whenever God is mentioned
ٱلَّذِى يُوَسْوِسُ فِي صُدُورِ ٱلنَّاسِ,who whispers in the breasts of mankind in their hearts — whenever they neglect to remember God
مِنَ ٱلْجِنَّةِ وَٱلنَّاسِ,of the jinn and mankind’ mina’l-jinnati wa’l-nāsi an explication for the whispering Satan being of the jinn and also of the humans similar to God’s saying the devils of humans and jinn Q. 6112; or mina’l-jinnati ‘of the jinn’ is an explication for him Satan wa’l-nāsi ‘and of mankind’ being a supplement to al-waswās ‘the whisperer’. Both explanations apply to the evil of the mentioned Labīd and his daughters; the objection to the first opinion is that humans do not ‘whisper’ in the hearts of other humans but that it is the jinn who whisper in their hearts I would respond by saying that human beings also ‘whisper’ in a manner appropriate to them beginning externally whereafter their whispers reach the heart and establish themselves in it in the way in which this customarily happens. But God knows best what is correct and to Him shall be the return and the final destination and may God bless our Master Muhammad and his family and Companions and grant them all much peace forever and always. God suffices for us and what an excellent guardian is He! And there is no power or might except in God the Sublime the Tremendous.
