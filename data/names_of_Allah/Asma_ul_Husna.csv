الرَّحْمَنُ,AR-RAHMAAN ,The Beneficent,He who wills goodness and mercy for all His creatures,"Allah is Ar-Rahmaan (in arabic: ٱلْرَّحْمَـانُ). He is the One who blesses all His creation with prosperity and devoid from disparity. He is most merciful, kind, and loving towards all creation. His Rahma is all inclusive and embraces all.","From the root ra-ha-mim (ر ح م), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to have tenderness, gentleness, kindness, to love, to have mercy, to have pity, to show favor and goodness, to have all that is required for beneficence.","Arabic Root:From the root ra-ha-mim (ر ح م), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to have tenderness, gentleness, kindness, to love, to have mercy, to have pity, to show favor and goodness, to have all that is required for beneficence.We begin the journey to understanding who Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ with the name Ar-Rahman and Ar-Raheem. As a way of developing His relationship with us, He tells us more about Him. The names most frequently used in the Qur'an are the names of Rahmah (i.e., His mercy). We begin every surah with the exception of Surah Taubah with the recitation of the Basmala (i.e., the bismillah), in which we proclaim His mercy. The Qur'an is a gift from Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ, a sign of His mercy. It gives the impression He would like all of mankind to know that He is the most gracious and the most merciful.There are 57 mentions of the name Ar-Rahman spanning across 16 different chapters of the Qur'an. قُلِ ٱدۡعُواْ ٱللَّهَ أَوِ ٱدۡعُواْ ٱلرَّحۡمَٰنَۖ أَيّٗا مَّا تَدۡعُواْ فَلَهُ ٱلۡأَسۡمَآءُ ٱلۡحُسۡنَىٰۚ وَلَا تَجۡهَرۡ بِصَلَاتِكَ وَلَا تُخَافِتۡ بِهَا وَٱبۡتَغِ بَيۡنَ ذَٰلِكَ سَبِيلٗاQulid'ul laaha awid'ur Rahmaana ayyam maa tad'oo falahul asmaaa'ul Husnaa; wa laa tajhar bi Salaatika wa laa tukhaafit bihaa wabtaghi baina zaalika sabeelaEnglish Translation:""Say, “Call upon Allah or call upon the Most Merciful. Whichever [name] you call - to Him belong the best names.” And do not recite [too] loudly in your prayer or [too] quietly but seek between that an [intermediate] way."" — (Qur'an 17:110)In the Qur'an ""My mercy encompasses all things"" (Qur'an 7:156) and Shaykh Tosun Bayrak writes of this name ""He is the one who wills mercy and good for all creation, at all times, without any distinction between the good and the bad, the faithful and the rebel, the beloved and the hated."" It is clear from this verse there is no discrimination as to whose worthy of His mercy and compassion.The Names of Mercy:There are eight names that refer to His mercy and kindness: Ar-Rahman, Ar-Raheem, Ar-Ra'uf, Al-Barr, Al-Wahhab, Al-Ghaffar, Al-Afuww, and At-Tawwab. Each name, although related under the umbrella of mercy, is unique. We'll explore each in detail and see the various ways in which Allah's mercy manifests. As for the name Ar-Rahman it is reserved for Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ alone. It's a quality that can't be ascribed to anybody else. A person can be referred to as Raheem, meaning being merciful. But Ar-Rahman is understood to be all-encompassing mercy, so far-reaching that it touches everything and everyone. A kind of mercy that knows no bounds. As a name, it is understood this kind of mercy is reserved only for Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. A person named Rahman must therefore have the prefix Abdur, meaning servant of the merciful.From the hadith, it comments on Allah's Rahmat (mercy), “Verily, Allah has one hundred portions of mercy. From one portion the creation has been given mercy by virtue of which there is mutual love between the people and ninety nine portions are reserved for the Day of Resurrection.”  [1]Abdullah ibn Amr reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said, “Those who are merciful will be shown mercy by the Most Merciful. Be merciful to those on the earth and the One in the heavens will have mercy upon you.” [2]Reflection:The belief in Allah's mercy is beneficial to a believer because it causes an individual to reflect on their ability to be merciful themselves. Narrated Jarir bin `Abdullah: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, ""Allah will not be merciful to those who are not merciful to mankind."" [3] It also encourages a believer to do good, to act with virtue so that they can receive the mercy of their Lord, ""As for those who believe and do good, the Most Compassionate will certainly bless them with genuine love"" (Surah Maryam ayah 96) 'Umar b. Khattab reported that there were brought some prisoners to Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) amongst whom there was also a woman, who was searching (for someone) and when she found a child amongst the prisoners, she took hold of it, pressed it against her chest and provided it suck. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Do you think this woman would ever afford to throw her child in the Fire? We said: By Allah, so far as it lies in her power, she would never throw the child in Fire.' Thereupon Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Allah is more kind to His servants than this woman is to her child. [4]Allah's mercy is vast and is described by Prophet ﷺ to be greater than a mother's love for her child. In Imam Zarruq's book, The loftiest goal in elucidating Allah's most beautiful names he recommends attaching oneself to this name through ""fellowship, hope, behaving with extreme affection because of firm trust in His affection."" Know Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is all-wise and all-knowing, you're forgiveness towards others, and their imperfections will be rewarded on the day of judgment. Lead with hope and compassion and seek to assist those who are misguided as they are in need. And on a concluding note for this name, begin every task by calling upon Ar-Rahman through the phrase, ""Bismillah Hir-Rahman Nir-Rahim,"" which means ""In the name of God, The Most Gracious, The Most Merciful."" All things are only made possible with Allah's blessing. We, too, require His mercy and grace in all matters.Hadith References:[1] Sahih Muslim 2753[2] Sunan al-Tirmidhi 1924[3] Sahih al-Bukhari 7376[4] Sahih al-Bukhari 5999 & Sahih Muslim 2754"
الرَّحِيمُ,AR RAHEEM ,The Merciful,He who acts with extreme kindness,"The name Ar-Raheem (in Arabic: ٱلْرَّحِيْمُ) comes from the same root as Ar-Rahman which refers to Allah's attribute of being Merciful. Although similarly related the meanings are different. Ar-Rahman can be understood to refer to Allah as the origination/source of all mercy, whereas Ar-Raheem refers to its sustaining/infiniteness. Some view the name of Ar-Raheem as being merciful to His creation deserving of mercy (primarily the mercy reserved for the believers).","From the root ra-ha-mim (ر ح م), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to have tenderness, gentleness, kindness to love to have mercy, to have pity to show favor and goodness to have all that is required for beneficence.","Arabic Root:From the root ra-ha-mim (ر ح م), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to have tenderness, gentleness, kindness to love to have mercy, to have pity to show favor and goodness to have all that is required for beneficence.This name of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is mentioned in the Qur'an for a total 114 times. Twice as much as the name Ar-Rahman.Is Ar-Raheem for the believers? هُوَ ٱلَّذِي يُصَلِّي عَلَيۡكُمۡ وَمَلَـٰٓئِكَتُهُۥ لِيُخۡرِجَكُم مِّنَ ٱلظُّلُمَٰتِ إِلَى ٱلنُّورِۚ وَكَانَ بِٱلۡمُؤۡمِنِينَ رَحِيمٗاHuwal lazee yusallee ‘alaikum wa malaaa'ikatuhoo liyukhrijakum minazzulumaati ilan-noor wa kaana bilmu'mineena RaheemaaEnglish Translation:""It is He who confers blessing upon you, and His angels [ask Him to do so] that He may bring you out from darknesses into the light. And ever is He, to the believers, Merciful."" — (Qur'an 33:43)This ayah is often referenced to support the idea that Ar-Rahman is a universal mercy that applies to all His creation and that 'Ar-Raheem' is a specific kind of mercy reserved only for ""al-mumin,"" the believers. Ibn Arabi in unveiling the secret of the most beautiful names mentions, ""God indicated that this Mercy was limited and restrained, after having manifested unconditional, absolute, and universal general mercy. Also, its relation to the servant depends on his limitations."" But here lies some disagreement among scholars. The counter-argument given that opposes this view is in Surah Baqarah, which directly challenges this notion: وَكَذَٰلِكَ  جَعَلۡنَٰكُمۡ  أُمَّةٗ  وَسَطٗا  لِّتَكُونُواْ  شُهَدَآءَ  عَلَى  ٱلنَّاسِ  وَيَكُونَ  ٱلرَّسُولُ  عَلَيۡكُمۡ  شَهِيدٗاۗ  وَمَا  جَعَلۡنَا  ٱلۡقِبۡلَةَ  ٱلَّتِي  كُنتَ  عَلَيۡهَآ  إِلَّا  لِنَعۡلَمَ  مَن  يَتَّبِعُ  ٱلرَّسُولَ  مِمَّن  يَنقَلِبُ  عَلَىٰ  عَقِبَيۡهِۚ  وَإِن  كَانَتۡ  لَكَبِيرَةً  إِلَّا  عَلَى  ٱلَّذِينَ  هَدَى  ٱللَّهُۗ  وَمَا  كَانَ  ٱللَّهُ  لِيُضِيعَ  إِيمَٰنَكُمۡۚ  إِنَّ  ٱللَّهَ  بِٱلنَّاسِ  لَرَءُوفٞ رَّحِيمٌۭWa kazaalika ja'alnaakum ummatanw wasatal litakoonoo shuhadaaa'a ‘alan naasi wa yakoonar Rasoolu ‘alaikum shaheedaa; wa maa ja'alnal qiblatal latee kunta ‘alaihaaa illaa lina'lama mai yattabi'ur Rasoola mimmai yanqalibu ‘alaa ‘aqibayh; wa in kaanat lakabeeratan illaa ‘alal lazeena hadal laah; wa maa kaanal laahu liyudee'a eemaanakum; innal laaha binnaasi la Ra'oofur RaheemEnglish Translation:""And thus we have made you a just community that you will be witnesses over the people and the Messenger will be a witness over you. And We did not make the qiblah which you used to face except that We might make evident who would follow the Messenger from who would turn back on his heels. And indeed, it is difficult except for those whom Allah has guided. And never would Allah have caused you to lose your faith. Indeed Allah is, to the people, Kind and Merciful."" — (Qur'an 2:143)Here it mentions Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ as ""Ra'oofur Raheem"" meaning kind and merciful. But for who? In this ayah, it says for all mankind, for all people. This gives the impression that the mercy that encompasses Raheem is not just reserved for Muslims but ""to the people."" ۞قُلۡ يَٰعِبَادِيَ ٱلَّذِينَ أَسۡرَفُواْ عَلَىٰٓ أَنفُسِهِمۡ لَا تَقۡنَطُواْ مِن رَّحۡمَةِ ٱللَّهِۚ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَغۡفِرُ ٱلذُّنُوبَ جَمِيعًاۚ إِنَّهُۥ هُوَ ٱلۡغَفُورُ ٱلرَّحِيمُQul yaa'ibaadiyal lazeena asrafoo ‘alaaa anfusihim laa taqnatoo mirrahmatil laah; innal laaha yaghfiruz zunooba jamee'aa; innahoo Huwal Ghafoorur RaheemEnglish Translation:""Say, 'O My servants who have transgressed against themselves [by sinning], do not despair of the mercy of Allah. Indeed, Allah forgives all sins. Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiving, the Merciful.'"" — (Qur'an 39:53)Hadith which illustrates Allah's mercy: Allah's mercy is vast, we can not begin to fathom the many ways in which He's shown us mercy. As we mentioned in the name Ar-Rahman, The Prophet ﷺ said to us, ""Do you think this woman could throw her child in the fire?"" We said, ""No, not if she is able to stop it."" The Prophet said, ""Allah is more merciful to His servants than a mother is to her child."" [1]On the authority of Ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him), from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ): ""Verily Allah has written down the good deeds and the evil deeds, and then explained it: ""Whosoever intended to perform a good deed, but did not do it, then Allah writes it down as a completed good deed. And if he intended to perform it and then did perform it, then Allah writes it down as from ten good deeds up to seven hundred times, up to many times multiplied. And if he intended to perform an evil deed, but did not do it, then Allah writes it down as a complete good deed. And if he intended it [i.e., the evil deed] and then performed it, then Allah writes it down as one evil deed. [2]Abu Huraira reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: When Allah created the creation as He was upon the Throne, He put down in His Book: Verily, My mercy predominates My wrath. [3]The belief in Allah's mercy is beneficial to a believer because it causes an individual to reflect on their ability to be merciful themselves. Narrated Jarir bin Abdullah: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, ""Allah will not be merciful to those who are not merciful to mankind."" [4] It also encourages a believer to do good, to act with virtue so that they can receive the mercy of their Lord, ""As for those who believe and do good, the Most Compassionate will certainly bless them with genuine love"" (Surah Maryam ayah 96) Hadith References:[1] Sahih Bukhari 5653 Grade: Sahih (authentic) according to Al-Bukhari[2] Sahih al-Bukhari 6491 & Sahih Muslim 131a[3] Sahih Muslim 2751a[4]Sahih al-Bukhari 7376"
الْمَلِكُ,AL MALIK ,The King,"The Sovereign Lord, The One with the complete Dominion, the One Whose Dominion is clear from imperfection","Allah is Al-Malik (in arabic: ٱلْمَلِكُ), the literal meaning in Arabic is ""The King."" He is the one who reigns dominion over the heavens and the earth and everything that resides within them. There is nothing above Him, and He is alone.","From the root mim-lam-kaf (م ل ك), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to possess, to own exclusively to exercise authority to command to have power over, command, reign to have dominion over, to have ruling power to have kingship.","Arabic Root:From the root mim-lam-kaf (م ل ك), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to possess, to own exclusively to exercise authority to command to have power over, command, reign to have dominion over, to have ruling power to have kingship.This name of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ tells us He is the absolute ruler, without any objection or partnership. Ibn Arabi says Al-Malik is the one ""for whom nothing He wants to do in His Sovereign kingdom is difficult."" All things in existence come from Him, and He presides as a sovereign ruler over them.The Ruler or The King:There is a difference in ٱلْمَـٰلِكُ (Al-Malik) and ٱلْمَـالِكُ (Al-Mālik), phonetically the difference is the second is said with a stress on the letter ""a"". Al-Malik is a king, a ruler over his subject whereas Al-Mālik is the master and owner. Al-Malik is the king, whose limits are not confined to a boundary, He is ever-lasting in time and space. He can never be abdicated from His throne and doesn't need the support of His subjects. Our perception of a king is that he leads the people, but he requires buy-in from his subjects. Without the support of the people, he has no power, no dominion. Abu Dharr reported Allah's messenger ﷺ as stating that God most high says, ""if the first and last of you, the living and the dead among you, those of you who are fresh and those of you who are withered, had all hearts as wretched as the heart of the most wretched of my servants, that would not diminish as much as a gnat's wing from my dominion.""  [1]This emphasizes how He has no need of any existing thing, He is independent. If all people were wretched in their hearts, i.e., they did not believe, He would still be the king. His dominion would not diminish even by a ""gnat's wing."" In his book, The Name & the Named Shayk Tosun Bayrak writes, ""He does not need His kingdom, His kingdom needs Him. He rules by Himself; He does not need any help to rule. He has created the universe as a workplace for His creation, and He has created the day of judgment as a great court of justice."" فَتَعَٰلَى ٱللَّهُ ٱلۡمَلِكُ ٱلۡحَقُّۗ وَلَا تَعۡجَلۡ بِٱلۡقُرۡءَانِ مِن قَبۡلِ أَن يُقۡضَىٰٓ إِلَيۡكَ وَحۡيُهُۥۖ وَقُل رَّبِّ زِدۡنِي عِلۡمٗاFata'aalal laahul Malikul Haqq; wa laa ta'jal bil Quraani min qabli ai yuqdaaa ilaika wahyuhoo wa qur Rabbi zidnee ilmaaEnglish Translation:""So high [above all] is Allah, the Sovereign, the Truth. And, [O Muhammad], do not hasten with [recitation of] the Qur'an before its revelation is completed to you, and say, ""My Lord, increase me in knowledge."" — (Qur'an 20:114) قُلِ ٱللَّهُمَّ مَٰلِكَ ٱلۡمُلۡكِ تُؤۡتِي ٱلۡمُلۡكَ مَن تَشَآءُ وَتَنزِعُ ٱلۡمُلۡكَ مِمَّن تَشَآءُ وَتُعِزُّ مَن تَشَآءُ وَتُذِلُّ مَن تَشَآءُۖ بِيَدِكَ ٱلۡخَيۡرُۖ إِنَّكَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيۡءٖ قَدِيرٞQulil laahumma Maalikal Mulki tu'til mulka man tashaaa'u wa tanzi'ul mulka mimman tashhaaa'u wa tu'izzu man tashaaa'u wa tuzillu man tashaaa'u biyadikal khairu innaka ‘alaa kulli shai'in QadeerEnglish Translation:""Say (O Muhammad SAW): “O Allah!

Verily, You are Able to do all things."" — (Qur'an 3:26) فَتَعَٰلَى ٱللَّهُ ٱلۡمَلِكُ ٱلۡحَقُّۖ لَآ إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ رَبُّ ٱلۡعَرۡشِ ٱلۡكَرِيمِFata'aalal laahul Malikul Haqq; laaa ilaaha illaa Huwa Rabbul Arshil KareemEnglish Translation:""So exalted is Allah, the Sovereign, the Truth; there is no deity except Him, Lord of the Noble Throne."" — (Qur'an 23:116) هُوَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِي لَآ إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ ٱلۡمَلِكُ ٱلۡقُدُّوسُ ٱلسَّلَٰمُ ٱلۡمُؤۡمِنُ ٱلۡمُهَيۡمِنُ ٱلۡعَزِيزُ ٱلۡجَبَّارُ ٱلۡمُتَكَبِّرُۚ سُبۡحَٰنَ ٱللَّهِ عَمَّا يُشۡرِكُونَHuwal-laahul-lazee laaa Ilaaha illaa Huwal-Malikul Quddoosus-Salaamul Muminul Muhaiminul-aAzeezul Jabbaarul-Mutakabbir; Subhaanal laahi Ammaa yushrikoonEnglish Translation:""He is Allah, other than whom there is no deity, the Sovereign, the Pure, the Perfection, the Bestower of Faith, the Overseer, the Exalted in Might, the Compeller, the Superior. Exalted is Allah above whatever they associate with Him."" — (Qur'an 59:23)From the hadith, it mentions Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying, ""The most awful name in Allah's sight on the Day of Resurrection, will be (that of) a man calling himself Malik Al-Amlak (the King of kings). [2] There can be no King of kings, as Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is the King of kings. To say otherwise would be blasphemous.Reflection:Our belief and understanding that Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Malik (The King) enables us to realize all matters we seek belong with Him. We see how this name encompasses an aura of grandness and majesty. He has complete knowledge, power, and rule over all His creation. So if we seek refuge, we should confide in Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ because only He can help provide relief. If we seek the bounty, we should ask from the King of kings because He is the only true provider with no limits.This belief also frees us from the shackles of dependence on wealthy leaders that may cause us to compromise our morals and integrity so that we may be in their favor. People will continually try to use fame, money, and power to control and influence our behavior for their benefit. But for the person who knows Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ as Al-Malik, they can break hold from the power others may hold over us. They see the illusion and don't fall for their tricks.A person who has Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ only needs Allah; they are free from worldly desires and can find happiness within. They can then focus on how to fulfill their duties and obligations as Muslims so that they may live like a King in the akhirah.There are other verses in the Qur'an that make mention of this name with it's variations. If you'd like further reading you can see Surah Fatiha ayah 4, Surah Burooj ayah 9, Surah al-A'raf ayah 158.Hadith References:[1] Mishkat al-Masabih 2350[2] Sahih al-Bukhari 6205"
الْقُدُّوسُ,AL-QUDDUS ,The Most Sacred / The Most Holy,"The one who is clear of any imperfection, weakness, or shortcoming.","Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Quddus (in Arabic: ٱلْقُدُّوسُ), meaning the most pure or the most holy. He is so far removed from any imperfection and does not suffer from any shortcomings. The mere mention of being free from defects borders on insult as it implies the possibility of imperfection. He transcends all that we perceive as perfection, and all sublime attributes belong to Him.","From the root qaf-dal-sin (ق د س), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be pure, clean, spotless be far removed from impurity or imperfection to be holy, sacred, and hallowed.","Arabic Root:From the root qaf-dal-sin (ق د س), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be pure, clean, spotless be far removed from impurity or imperfection to be holy, sacred, and hallowed.The name Al-Quddus is derived from the word quds meaning sanctify, purify, or to be holy. Al-Quddus is the superlative which captures His essence of perfection. He is far removed from resembling anything. Imam al-Ghazali writes in his treatise of the 99 names, ""the Holy is the one who transcends every one of the attributes of perfection which the majority of creatures thinks of as perfection.""The Holy Spirit:The Qur'an mentions the concept of the Holy Spirit (Ruh Al-Quddus) four times. It is understood that He purifies and makes holy through this spirit. This is the concept of the divine force and influence Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ has over His creatures. Whenever you see either Ruh al-Quddus or Ruh al-Amin (the faithful or trustworthy spirit, see 26:193 for example) the commentators of the Qur'an interpret it as being interchangeable with the Angel Jibrel. In the tafsir of Ibn Kathir for Surah Maidah ayah 110, ""O Isa, son of Maryam! Remember My favor to you and to your mother when I supported you with Ruh il-Qudus (Jibril) so that you spoke to the people in the cradle and in maturity [...] and you healed those born blind, and the lepers by My permission, and when you brought forth the dead by My permission;"" When Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ mentions the passing of this spirit it's understood as to cast a reflection of His divine characteristics on His creation. It makes a thing pure, and wholesome and removes any imperfections. Isa (as) was gifted with this quality making him infallible and enabled him to perform these miracles. ۞تِلۡكَ  ٱلرُّسُلُ  فَضَّلۡنَا  بَعۡضَهُمۡ  عَلَىٰ  بَعۡضٖۘ  مِّنۡهُم  مَّن  كَلَّمَ  ٱللَّهُۖ  وَرَفَعَ  بَعۡضَهُمۡ  دَرَجَٰتٖۚ  وَءَاتَيۡنَا  عِيسَى  ٱبۡنَ  مَرۡيَمَ  ٱلۡبَيِّنَٰتِ  وَأَيَّدۡنَٰهُ  بِرُوحِ  ٱلۡقُدُسِۗ  وَلَوۡ  شَآءَ  ٱللَّهُ  مَا  ٱقۡتَتَلَ  ٱلَّذِينَ  مِنۢ  بَعۡدِهِم  مِّنۢ  بَعۡدِ  مَا  جَآءَتۡهُمُ  ٱلۡبَيِّنَٰتُ  وَلَٰكِنِ  ٱخۡتَلَفُواْ  فَمِنۡهُم  مَّنۡ  ءَامَنَ  وَمِنۡهُم  مَّن  كَفَرَۚ  وَلَوۡ  شَآءَ  ٱللَّهُ  مَا  ٱقۡتَتَلُواْ  وَلَٰكِنَّ  ٱللَّهَ  يَفۡعَلُ  مَا  يُرِيدُTilkar Rusulu faddalnaa ba'dahum ‘alaa ba'd; minhum man kallamal laahu wa rafa'a ba'dahum darajaat; wa aatainaa ‘Eesab na Maryamal baiyinaati wa ayyadnaahu bi Roohil Qudus; wa law shaaa'al laahu maqtatalal lazeena mimba'dihim mim ba'di maa jaaa'athumul baiyinaatu wa laakinikh talafoo faminhum man aamana wa minhum man kafar; wa law shaaa'al laahu maq tataloo wa laakinnallaaha yaf'alu maa yureed (section 33)English Translation:""Those messengers - some of them We caused to exceed others.

And if Allah had willed, they would not have fought each other, but Allah does what He intends."" — (Qur'an 2:253) إِذۡ قَالَ ٱللَّهُ يَٰعِيسَى ٱبۡنَ مَرۡيَمَ ٱذۡكُرۡ نِعۡمَتِي عَلَيۡكَ وَعَلَىٰ وَٰلِدَتِكَ إِذۡ أَيَّدتُّكَ بِرُوحِ ٱلۡقُدُسِ تُكَلِّمُ ٱلنَّاسَ فِي ٱلۡمَهۡدِ وَكَهۡلٗاۖ وَإِذۡ عَلَّمۡتُكَ ٱلۡكِتَٰبَ وَٱلۡحِكۡمَةَ وَٱلتَّوۡرَىٰةَ وَٱلۡإِنجِيلَۖ وَإِذۡ تَخۡلُقُ مِنَ ٱلطِّينِ كَهَيۡـَٔةِ ٱلطَّيۡرِ بِإِذۡنِي فَتَنفُخُ فِيهَا فَتَكُونُ طَيۡرَۢا بِإِذۡنِيۖ وَتُبۡرِئُ ٱلۡأَكۡمَهَ وَٱلۡأَبۡرَصَ بِإِذۡنِيۖ وَإِذۡ تُخۡرِجُ ٱلۡمَوۡتَىٰ بِإِذۡنِيۖ وَإِذۡ كَفَفۡتُ بَنِيٓ إِسۡرَـٰٓءِيلَ عَنكَ إِذۡ جِئۡتَهُم بِٱلۡبَيِّنَٰتِ فَقَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِنۡهُمۡ إِنۡ هَٰذَآ إِلَّا سِحۡرٞ مُّبِينٞIz qaalal laahu yaa ‘Eesab-na-Maryamaz kur ni'matee ‘alaika wa ‘alaa waalidatika; iz aiyattuka bi Roohil Qudusi tukallimun naasa fil mahdi wa kahlanw wa iz ‘allamtukal kitaaba wal Hikmata wa Tawraata wal Injeela wa iz Takhluqu minat teeni kahai ‘atit tairi bi iznee fatanfukhu feeha fatakoonu tairam bi iznee wa tubri'ul akmaha wal abrasa bi iznee wa iz tukhrijul mawtaa bi iznee wa iz kafaftu Baneee Israaa'eela ‘anka iz ji'tahum bil baiyinaati fa qaalal lazeena kafaroo minhum in haazaaa illaa sihrum mubeenEnglish Translation:[The Day] when Allah will say, “O Jesus, Son of Mary, remember My favor upon you and upon your mother when I supported you with the Pure Spirit and you spoke to the people in the cradle and in maturity; and [remember] when I taught you writing and wisdom and the Torah and the Gospel; and when you designed from clay [what was] like the form of a bird with My permission, then you breathed into it, and it became a bird with My permission; and you healed the blind and the leper with My permission; and when you brought forth the dead with My permission; and when I restrained the Children of Israel from [killing] you when you came to them with clear proofs and those who disbelieved among them said, 'This is not but obvious magic.'"" — (Qur'an 5:110) قُلۡ نَزَّلَهُۥ رُوحُ ٱلۡقُدُسِ مِن رَّبِّكَ بِٱلۡحَقِّ لِيُثَبِّتَ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَهُدٗى وَبُشۡرَىٰ لِلۡمُسۡلِمِينَQul nazzalahoo Roohul Qudusi mir Rabbika bilhaqqi liyusabbital lazeena aamanoo wa hudanw wa bushraa lilmuslimeenEnglish Translation:""Say, [O Muhammad], 'The Pure Spirit has brought it down from your Lord in truth to make firm those who believe and as guidance and good tidings to the Muslims.'"" — (Qur'an 16:102) هُوَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِي لَآ إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ ٱلۡمَلِكُ ٱلۡقُدُّوسُ ٱلسَّلَٰمُ ٱلۡمُؤۡمِنُ ٱلۡمُهَيۡمِنُ ٱلۡعَزِيزُ ٱلۡجَبَّارُ ٱلۡمُتَكَبِّرُۚ سُبۡحَٰنَ ٱللَّهِ عَمَّا يُشۡرِكُونَHuwal-laahul-lazee laaa Ilaaha illaa Huwal-Malikul Quddoosus-Salaamul Muminul Muhaiminul-aAzeezul Jabbaarul-Mutakabbir; Subhaanal laahi Ammaa yushrikoonEnglish Translation:""He is Allah, other than whom there is no deity, the Sovereign, the Pure, the Perfection, the Bestower of Faith, the Overseer, the Exalted in Might, the Compeller, the Superior.

[2]It was narrated from Ubayy bin Ka'b that: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to pray witr with three rak'ahs. In the first he would recite: ""Glorify the Name of Your Lord, the Most High"" in the second: ""Say: O you disbelievers!"", and in the third: ""Say: He is Allah, (the) One"". And he would say the Qunut before bowing, and when he finished he would say: Subhanal-Malikil-Quddus (Glory be to the Sovereign, the Most Holy) three times, elongating the words the last time. [3]Reflection:We can benefit from knowing Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Quddus by trying to be pure and sanctified. We need to cleanse ourselves where Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ looks, which is in our hearts and our actions. This is a lifelong journey of freeing ourselves from desires and avoiding anger, lust, and addictions to food or clothing. Instead, be engaged in tawbah, i.e., seek Allah's forgiveness, for He can cleanse you of any mistakes or wrongdoings. He can guide the one who is lost. As we'll explore in later sections, the name Al-Afuww, the effacer of sins - He pardons any sin and leaves no trace of any fault. Remember, Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Quddus, the pure and the Holy, and He created you. There's a purpose and wisdom for your existence. We may not understand it or seem lost at times. But when we turn back to Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ we become reoriented and start to feel whole.References:[1] Sahih Muslim 487a[2] Sahih (Al-Albani) Sunan Abi Dawud 1430[3] Sahih (Darussalam) Sunan an-Nasa'i 1699 & Sunan an-Nasa'i 1732"
السَّلاَمُ,As-Salam ,The Giver of Peace,"The Most Perfect, The Source of Peace, The Giver of Blessings.",Allah is As-Salam (in Arabic: ٱلْسَّلَامُ); He is the One who grants peace and security to all His creation. Allah is above and beyond all weaknesses and inflictions. The source of peace and security for mankind. Breaking away from As-Salam brings disturbance and destruction to oneself. It is because He is free of any defect that the one who is with Him experiences tranquility.,"From the root sin-lam-mim (س ل م), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be peaceful, quiet, tranquil, content, friendly, reconciled, to be free from imperfections, free of faults, complete, whole, sound, to be safe, secure, well, healthy, and prosperous.","From the root sin-lam-mim (س ل م), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be peaceful, quiet, tranquil, content, friendly, reconciled, to be free from imperfections, free of faults, complete, whole, sound, to be safe, secure, well, healthy, and prosperous.The Salam:We know from our greeting one another with assalamualaikum, that we are sending peace upon the receiver. As-Salam refers to the attribute of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ as the source of this peace. The word Islam also shares the same root of s-l-m which encompasses the concept of peace which is one of core principles of the religion. This name also implies the idea of ""soundness"" or ""wholesomeness,"" i.e., being flawless, free from blemishes. He is complete and whole. Nothing depletes Him as He is self-sufficient. It is because of this nature of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ the one who is with him can feel safety and security.In the scripture genesis 2:2, it states, ""By the seventh day God had finished the work he had been doing; so on the seventh day he rested from all his work."" But this view is inconsistent with the Islamic attributes of God. In Surah Qaf verse 38, ""And We did certainly create the heavens and earth and what is between them in six days, and there touched Us no weariness."" In this way As-Salam is similar to the meaning of Al-Quddus which both negate any kind of imperfection in His qualities.Mentions of As-Salam in the Qur'an: هُوَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِي لَآ إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ ٱلۡمَلِكُ ٱلۡقُدُّوسُ ٱلسَّلَٰمُ ٱلۡمُؤۡمِنُ ٱلۡمُهَيۡمِنُ ٱلۡعَزِيزُ ٱلۡجَبَّارُ ٱلۡمُتَكَبِّرُۚ سُبۡحَٰنَ ٱللَّهِ عَمَّا يُشۡرِكُونَHuwal-laahul-lazee laaa Ilaaha illaa Huwal-Malikul Quddoosus-Salaamul Muminul Muhaiminul-aAzeezul Jabbaarul-Mutakabbir; Subhaanal laahi Ammaa yushrikoonEnglish Translation:""Allah is He, than Whom there is no other god;- the Sovereign, the Holy One, the Source of Peace (and Perfection), the Guardian of Faith, the Preserver of Safety, the Exalted in Might, the Irresistible, the Supreme: Glory to Allah! (High is He) above the partners they attribute to Him."" — (Qur'an 59:23)The usage of the word Salam is used repeatedly throughout the Qur'an but referring to the attribute of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ as the giver of peace only once. For example, in Surah as-Saffat verse 181: وَسَلَٰمٌ عَلَى ٱلۡمُرۡسَلِينَWa salaamun ‘alalmursaleenEnglish Translation:""And peace upon the messengers."" — (Qur'an 37:181)But remember the originator of such peace is Allah. By turning to Him by this name As-Salam, seeking His guidance, we hope to attain the final destination in paradise (home of salam, peace).From Surah Yaseen: سَلَٰمٞ قَوۡلٗا مِّن رَّبّٖ رَّحِيمٖSalaamun qawlam mir Rabbir RaheemEnglish Translation:""[And] “Peace,” a word from a Merciful Lord."" — (Qur'an 36:58)We provide a little more context here with the previous three ayat leading up to verse 58, ""55. Verily, the dwellers of the Paradise, that Day, will be busy with joyful things. 56. They and their wives will be in pleasant shade, reclining on thrones. 57. They will have therein fruits and all that they ask for. 58. (It will be said to them): “Salam (Peace!)” — a Word from the Lord, Most Merciful.""In the hadith, the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) affirmed this name when he heard the companions (may Allah be pleased with them) say, ""salam upon Allah."" He corrected them saying, ""Allah Himself is As-Salam (Peace), and if anyone of you prays then he should say, 'All the compliments, prayers and good things are due to Allah; peace be on you, O Prophet, and Allah's mercy and blessings [be on you]. Peace be on us an on the pious subjects of Allah.'"" [1]Supplicate with this name:In another narration, it was reported that the Prophet (ﷺ) recited this name in his supplication after prayer. Thauban reported: When the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) finished his prayer. He begged forgiveness three times and said: (Allahumma Antas-Salam wa minkas-salam. Tabarakta ya Dhal-jalali wal-Ikram.) O Allah! Thou art Peace, and peace comes from Thee; Blessed art Thou, O Possessor of Glory and Honour. Walid reported: I said to Auza'i: How is the seeking of forgiveness? He replied: You should say: I beg forgiveness from Allah, I beg forgiveness from Allah."" [2]Reflection:We can benefit from knowing As-Salam by working daily to attain peace. This process involves freeing the heart and mind from silly games with no upside, like jealousy, envy, and revenge. As the saying goes, ""resentment is like drinking poison and then hoping it will kill your enemies."" This is not the way to achieve peace. Be forgiving of yourself and others. Focus your effort to try and become as close to flawless as you can get. Work to minimize all your imperfections. When a person can love himself and love others, he will naturally bring peace to the earth.The Prophet ﷺ also characterized the believer as a being safe. It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: ""The Muslim is the one from whose tongue and hand the people are safe, and the believer is the one from whom the people's lives and wealth are safe."" [3]Anas reported that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, ""As-Salam (peace) is one of the Names of Allah Almighty which Allah has placed in the earth. Therefore give the greeting among yourselves"" [4] and ""Abu Huraira reported: The Messenger of Allah (may peace and blessing be upon him) observed: You shall not enter Paradise so long as you do not affirm belief (in all those things which are the articles of faith) and you will not believe as long as you do not love one another. Should I not direct you to a thing which, if you do, will foster love amongst you: (i.e.) give currency to (the practice of paying salutation to one another by saying) as-salamu alaikum.""

الْمُؤْمِنُ,Al-Mu'min ,The Infuser of Faith,"The Affirmer of Truth, The Guarantor, The Giver of Faith.",The name of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ as Al-Mu'min (in Arabic: ٱلْمُؤْمِنُ) means The One who witnessed for Himself that no one is God but Him. And He is the one who sent down Messengers and revealed His Books as clear proofs.,":From the root hamza-mim-nun (أ م ن), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be secure, safe, free from fear to be quiet, tranquil to grant protection, safeguard to be trusted, trustworthy to believe in.","Arabic Roots:From the root hamza-mim-nun (أ م ن), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be secure, safe, free from fear to be quiet, tranquil to grant protection, safeguard to be trusted, trustworthy to believe in.Meanings of Al-Mu'min: Each name we explore and study unlocks a door to further our relationship with Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. As we grow more acquainted with His essence, we can feel our relationship with Him transform and become more secure. The sixth name of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Mu'min which is the quality that has enabled the hearts to experience this feeling and brought us together. Al-Mu'min is the inspirer of faith and the giver of security. He's the one who's sent down His book and Messengers with signs of clear proof for all who'd listen. Some of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ names can have many meanings or interpretations. Al-Mu'min is one of those names.He is the one who provides justice and security to His creations. He fulfills all His promises and will never punish any creature unfairly. He is as His servant expects Him to be, ""Indeed, Allah does not do injustice, [even] as much as an atom's weight; while if there is a good deed, He multiplies it and gives from Himself a great reward."" (Qur'an 4:40) This sentiment is repeated in Surah Ghafir verse 17, ""This Day every soul will be recompensed for what it earned. No injustice today! Indeed, Allah is swift in account.""The Qur'an repeatedly mentions the believer as mu'min, so how do we then ascribe this name as an attribute of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ? First, the context is completely different; what's true for one does not mean it's true for the other. In reality, there is no comparison with Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ with anything. Mumin is derived from amana or imaan, meaning security, surety, and/or peace. When it refers to the believer, it means the one who attests to what is true (i.e., the six articles of faith - (1) Belief in God, (2) Angels, (3) Books, (4) Messengers, (5) Day of Judgment, and (6) His Divine Decree). When it applies to Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ, it is the one who confirms Himself as being true. So the one who believes is said to have security, safety, and protection from potential danger. هُوَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِي لَآ إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ ٱلۡمَلِكُ ٱلۡقُدُّوسُ ٱلسَّلَٰمُ ٱلۡمُؤۡمِنُ ٱلۡمُهَيۡمِنُ ٱلۡعَزِيزُ ٱلۡجَبَّارُ ٱلۡمُتَكَبِّرُۚ سُبۡحَٰنَ ٱللَّهِ عَمَّا يُشۡرِكُونَHuwal-laahul-lazee laaa Ilaaha illaa Huwal-Malikul Quddoosus-Salaamul Muminul Muhaiminul-aAzeezul Jabbaarul-Mutakabbir; Subhaanal laahi Ammaa yushrikoonEnglish Translation:""He is Allah, other than whom there is no deity, the Sovereign, the Pure, the Perfection, the Bestower of Faith, the Overseer, the Exalted in Might, the Compeller, the Superior. Exalted is Allah above whatever they associate with Him."" — (Qur'an 59:23)We are weak without Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ:Imam al-Ghazali writes an analogy of a man left alone in a state of ruin where he could not move his limbs and was pursued by enemies. Even if he could move, he still had no weapons or soldiers to fight with. Even if he had weapons or an able army he could not guarantee victory. Then someone comes to his rescue, attends to him in his weakness, provides him a big sturdy fortress, soldiers, and weapons, and grants him complete security and safety. The only befitting name for such a person would be ""the faithful"".Imam Ghazali continues, ""Man is basically weak by nature."" Our being compared to other creations seems like we are strong in the hierarchy of the animal kingdom, but in many ways, we are also fragile. The Qur'an even mentions this fact: يُرِيدُ ٱللَّهُ أَن يُخَفِّفَ عَنكُمۡۚ وَخُلِقَ ٱلۡإِنسَٰنُ ضَعِيفٗاYureedul laahu ai yukhaffifa ‘ankum; wa khuliqal insaanu da'eefaaEnglish Translation:""And Allah wants to lighten for you [your difficulties]; and mankind was created weak."" — (Qur'an 4:28)There exists many threats to our well-being. We have deadly diseases and infections, suffering from thirst and hunger, fear of fatal accidents, wars, and riots. It's a never-ending anxiety-inducing list. This is just phsyical realm of weakness. Then there's a spiritual aspect of being weak in regards to controlling one's desires, impulses, emotions, etc. Shaykh Tosun Bayrak said regarding this, ""the worst of these enemies are our own egos and the accursed Devil. The tyrants, the maligners, the envious, come after them.""Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is the only one who can protect us from all forms of harm and adversity. The Qur'an mentions how the people of Quraysh had their fears removed and prospered after the du'a Prophet Ibrahim (as) made. He asked for their safety, security, and prosperity, and to this day, the request of his du'a is fulfilled. From this, we understand that true security is only found with Allah Azzawajal. ٱلَّذِيٓ أَطۡعَمَهُم مِّن جُوعٖ وَءَامَنَهُم مِّنۡ خَوۡفِۭAllazeee at'amahum min joo'inw-wa-aamanahum min khawfEnglish Translation:""Who has fed them, [saving them] from hunger and made them safe, [saving them] from fear."" — (Qur'an 106:4)Reflection:We can benefit from knowing Al-Mu'min by having faith and trusting in Allah. Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ tells us in the Qur'an His rewards and promises for those who believe. We should feel special, immense gratitude, and honor that Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ put belief in our hearts.Just as Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is the source for safety and security, we should live this attribute by being a beacon for safety and security for others. ""It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) observed: He will not enter Paradise whose neighbor is not secure from his wrongful conduct."" [1] The people should feel a blanket of comfort, warmth, and love that radiates from you.Al-Mumin also protects us from injustice and oppression, so we must also stand up for what is right. If we see injustice, we should not remain silent. In whatever capacity we can help and try to make a difference, we should. This name, Al-Mu'min, can be invoked in any prayer. Still, it should be kept in mind by anyone experiencing fear or insecurity as a reminder to call upon Allah for protection, ""Oh Allah! You are Al-Mu'min, protect us from this evil / enemy / oppressor. Give us the strength to be strong in our faith and let it not waver.""References:[1] Sahih Muslim 46"
الْمُهَيْمِنُ,Al-Muhaymin,The Guardian,The Preserver of Safety & Overseeing Protector.,"Allah is Al Muhaymin (ٱلْمُهَيْمِنُ), meaning the one who ensures well being and protection over His creation. He is also the ever watchful. Nothing that can be hidden from Him, He is the knower of all the secrets we conceal.","From the root ha-mim-nun (ه م ن), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to watch over, oversee, protect, guard to be a witness to offer security and peace to determine what is true, to extend a wing. Similar to the Arabic expression, 'haymana al-ta'ir alafirdkhih' meaning that the bird took its young ones under the protection of its wings.","Arabic Root:From the root ha-mim-nun (ه م ن), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to watch over, oversee, protect, guard to be a witness to offer security and peace to determine what is true, to extend a wing. Similar to the Arabic expression, 'haymana al-ta'ir alafirdkhih' meaning that the bird took its young ones under the protection of its wings.The Absolute Authority of Al-Muhaymin:The name Al-Muhaymin refers to His supreme nature as being the guardian or the absolute authority. He is the superseder, nothing will overtake or usurp Him. He is the ever-watchful, not just limited to the superficial, He can see all which is concealed in the hearts. Nothing can be kept a secret from Him. ""He knows what is in the heavens and earth; He knows what you conceal and what you reveal; God knows very well the secrets of every heart."" (64:4)You can find variations of the word muhaymin, like muhaiminan in Surah Maidah verse 48 where Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ declares the Qur'an as being the book that will be well-guarded over the other books:Muhsin Khan Translation:""And We have sent down to you (O Muhammad ﷺ) the Book (this Quran) in truth, confirming the Scripture that came before it and Mohayminan (trustworthy in highness and a witness) over it (old Scriptures).""But as a name and attribute of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ, Al-Muhaymin is only ever mentioned once in the Qur'an. هُوَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِي لَآ إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ ٱلۡمَلِكُ ٱلۡقُدُّوسُ ٱلسَّلَٰمُ ٱلۡمُؤۡمِنُ ٱلۡمُهَيۡمِنُ ٱلۡعَزِيزُ ٱلۡجَبَّارُ ٱلۡمُتَكَبِّرُۚ سُبۡحَٰنَ ٱللَّهِ عَمَّا يُشۡرِكُونَHuwal-laahul-lazee laaa Ilaaha illaa Huwal-Malikul Quddoosus-Salaamul Muminul Muhaiminul-aAzeezul Jabbaarul-Mutakabbir; Subhaanal laahi Ammaa yushrikoonEnglish Translation:""He is Allah, other than whom there is no deity, the Sovereign, the Pure, the Perfection, the Bestower of Faith, the Overseer, the Exalted in Might, the Compeller, the Superior. Exalted is Allah above whatever they associate with Him."" — (Qur'an 59:23)A sense of ownership/authority:The word هيمنة (transliteration: haymana) in modern Arabic means dominance. One country can seize another, being in control or showing authority over that state. But this is often transitory, exchanging hands from one ""owner"" to another. Only Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Muhaymin, the one who has complete guardianship, a quality of being in control, supremely that lasts for eternity. It is not limited by any means.But this is one form of dominance. Muhaymin also refers to an authoritative figure who reigns supreme, one that you can trust. This is analogous to a parent who out of love for their child will set rules and boundaries to protect and care for the child. It's often done in the best interest despite the kid thinking otherwise. Imam Al-Ghazali says, ""Everyone who has complete command of a situation, who takes possession of it and protects it, will be its 'Guardian.' taking command comes down to knowledge, possession to the perfection of power, and protection to action. The one who unites these meanings is named Guardian. But only God - great and glorious - joins them absolutely and perfectly.""Reflection:How do we benefit from knowing that Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Muhaymin? Just as Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is the overseer of all His creation, we need to be watchful over ourselves. Many people do not know themselves - they think they are their thoughts. We can let horrible or negative thoughts come to mind, but we don't have to identify with them. We can let it come and pass, just like how a river flows. Identification, thinking you are your thoughts, is like a beaver building a dam in the river. This only ends up damaging the surrounding environment.Similarly, identification can be destructive, leading to either a depressive state or causing one to become arrogant or narcissistic. Instead, it is better to try and be indifferent. Take time to observe and watch your thoughts come and go. Ask where and why they may have arisen. Analyze their depths, and you may uncover secrets about yourself hiding in your psyche. Imam Ghazali recognizes this watching as a crucial step in reforming oneself, allowing one to become a guardian over his or her heart. Only selectively choosing thoughts that are constructive and letting everything else go.Another way in which one can try to characterize themselves by this name is to be observant of those around you. People in passing will reveal certain pains and troubles. If you are watchful, you can exhibit a Prophetic tradition of the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ which was to care for the needs of those around him. In this sense, you are a guardian, being watchful and showing care and compassion to those around you."
الْعَزِيزُ,Al-Aziz,The Mighty One,"The Strong, The Most Esteemed, The Exalted in Might.","Al-Aziz (in Arabic: ٱلْعَزِيزُ) is the one who is most powerful and strong. He is the conqueror that is never conquered and never harmed. This is because His strength, glory, and power are overwhelming, and cannot be overcome or resisted. He is the only one with complete mastery over all creation.","From the root ayn-zay-zay (ع ز ز), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be mighty, potent, strong, powerful to be high, elevated, noble, exalted to be honorable, noble, glorious, illustrious to be indomitable, invincible to be respected, cherished, dear to be scarce, rare, precious, and unattainable.","Arabic Root:From the root ayn-zay-zay (ع ز ز), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be mighty, potent, strong, powerful to be high, elevated, noble, exalted to be honorable, noble, glorious, illustrious to be indomitable, invincible to be respected, cherished, dear to be scarce, rare, precious, and unattainable.There are several meanings to the name of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ as Al-Aziz (Al-Azeez). Common translations include The Almighty, The Mighty One, or The Eminent One. The word Azeez comes from izzat meaning honor and nobility.The divine pairing of names:This great name of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ appears approximately 90 times in the Qur'an. It's often paired with another name, for example, Al-Aziz Al-Rahim, Al-Aziz Al-Hakeem, Al-Aziz Al-Ghaffar, or Al-Aziz Al-Wahhab. The pairing of names oftens conveys an additional layer, we learn something new about Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ that would often be overlooked if we just studied these names independently.For example, what does it mean to be Al-Aziz Al-Rahim? Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is in a position of power, He can subdue anyone who opposes Him. Yet to those who deny and to those who disbelieve, He is always merciful first. ""My mercy predominates My wrath"" [1] He does not hasten to punish the one who errs but gives them time to repent. And even when He punishes the transgressors, He can be most severe, but He punishes with mercy. These meanings are said to be divinely designed, whose perfection in meaning is understood best through the pairing of names. أَمۡ عِندَهُمۡ خَزَآئِنُ رَحۡمَةِ رَبِّكَ ٱلۡعَزِيزِ ٱلۡوَهَّابِAm'indahum khazaaa ‘inu rahmati Rabbikal Azeezil WahhabEnglish Translation:""Or do they have the depositories of the mercy of your Lord, the Exalted in Might, the Bestower?"" — (Qur'an 38:9)The Pairing Al-Azeez and Al-Hakeem: وَلِلَّهِ جُنُودُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلۡأَرۡضِۚ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ عَزِيزًا حَكِيمًاWa lillaahi junoodus samaawaati wal ard; wa kaanal laahu azeezan hakeemaEnglish Translation:""And to Allah belong the soldiers of the heavens and the earth. And ever is Allah Exalted in Might and Wise."" — (Qur'an 48:7)The juxtaposition of Al-Aziz and Al-Hakeem is also an interesting pairing. The saying ""absolute power corrupts absolutely"" does not apply to Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ as He is the all-wise. Humans are fallible. We see it repeatedly happen when a person gains absolute power in their small domain. It's often met with cronyism, nepotism, and corruption. A person you perceive as wise or humble can become blinded by power. They are not all-wise and all-knowing. Only Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is the rare exception capable of combining all these attributes perfectly. فَالِقُ ٱلۡإِصۡبَاحِ وَجَعَلَ ٱلَّيۡلَ سَكَنٗا وَٱلشَّمۡسَ وَٱلۡقَمَرَ حُسۡبَانٗاۚ ذَٰلِكَ تَقۡدِيرُ ٱلۡعَزِيزِ ٱلۡعَلِيمِFaaliqul isbaahi wa ja'alal laila sakananw wash shamsa walqamara husbaanaa; zaalika taqdeerul Azeezil AleemEnglish Translation:""[He is] the cleaver of daybreak and has made the night for rest and the sun and moon for calculation. That is the determination of the Exalted in Might, the Knowing."" — (Qur'an 6:96) وَمِنَ ٱلنَّاسِ وَٱلدَّوَآبِّ وَٱلۡأَنۡعَٰمِ مُخۡتَلِفٌ أَلۡوَٰنُهُۥ كَذَٰلِكَۗ إِنَّمَا يَخۡشَى ٱللَّهَ مِنۡ عِبَادِهِ ٱلۡعُلَمَـٰٓؤُاْۗ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ غَفُورٌWa minan naasi wadda waaabbi wal an'aami mukhtalifun alwaanuhoo kazalik; innamaa yakhshal laaha min ‘ibaadihil ‘ulamaaa'; innal laaha Azeezun GhafoorEnglish Translation:""And among people and moving creatures and grazing livestock are various colors similarly.

We can supplicate using this name if we wish to be mighty. It's natural to aspire for wealth, success, or prestige. It's a noble cause, especially if the goal of attainment is using that wealth to further Islam and/or to help others. To be blinded in the pursuit of these things that you forget all your other duties is not virtuous and should be avoided. It's a fine line that requires careful examination, honesty with oneself, and awareness.If you have hunger or burning desire for success, health, wealth, and prestige you should seek it from the true possessor of might, honor and rank. In Surah Imran ayah 26: قُلِ ٱللَّهُمَّ مَٰلِكَ ٱلۡمُلۡكِ تُؤۡتِي ٱلۡمُلۡكَ مَن تَشَآءُ وَتَنزِعُ ٱلۡمُلۡكَ مِمَّن تَشَآءُ وَتُعِزُّ مَن تَشَآءُ وَتُذِلُّ مَن تَشَآءُۖ بِيَدِكَ ٱلۡخَيۡرُۖ إِنَّكَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيۡءٖ قَدِيرٞQulil laahumma Maalikal Mulki tu'til mulka man tashaaa'u wa tanzi'ul mulka mimman tashhaaa'u wa tu'izzu man tashaaa'u wa tuzillu man tashaaa'u biyadikal khairu innaka ‘alaa kulli shai'in QadeerEnglish Translation:""Say, “O Allah, Owner of Sovereignty, You give sovereignty to whom You will and You take sovereignty away from whom You will.

الْجَبَّارُ,Al-Jabbar,The All Compelling,"The Irresistible, The Restorer, The Repairer.","Al-Jabbar (in Arabic: ٱلْجَبَّارُ), there are several accepted meanings to this name. The most often quoted is The Compeller. He implements His decree without any opposition. There is no one that prevails over Him. The other interpretation is the repairer. He restores all of creation. He heals the broken-hearted, binds their wounds, and brings comfort to the weak. He compels each and everything to His divine will but is never Himself compelled.","From the root jim-ba-ra (ج ب ر), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to restore something to sound, right or good state to bring back to normal, reform to benefit, to confer a benefit to be supreme, high, above all of creation to be compelling, irresistible.","Arabic Root:From the root jim-ba-ra (ج ب ر), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to restore something to sound, right or good state to bring back to normal, reform to benefit, to confer a benefit to be supreme, high, above all of creation to be compelling, irresistible.As a name of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ Al-Jabbar is only mentioned once in the Qur'an. هُوَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِي لَآ إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ ٱلۡمَلِكُ ٱلۡقُدُّوسُ ٱلسَّلَٰمُ ٱلۡمُؤۡمِنُ ٱلۡمُهَيۡمِنُ ٱلۡعَزِيزُ ٱلۡجَبَّارُ ٱلۡمُتَكَبِّرُۚ سُبۡحَٰنَ ٱللَّهِ عَمَّا يُشۡرِكُونَHuwal-laahul-lazee laaa Ilaaha illaa Huwal-Malikul Quddoosus-Salaamul Muminul Muhaiminul-aAzeezul Jabbaarul-Mutakabbir; Subhaanal laahi Ammaa yushrikoonEnglish Translation:""He is Allah, other than whom there is no deity, the Sovereign, the Pure, the Perfection, the Bestower of Faith, the Overseer, the Exalted in Might, the Compeller, the Superior. Exalted is Allah above whatever they associate with Him."" — (Qur'an 59:23)Verses that describe Allah (سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ) decree:There are other verses that we can examine which helps us understand what it means to be Al-Jabbar. For example, in Surah Insan verse 30, ""And you do not will except that Allah wills. Indeed, Allah is ever Knowing and Wise."" Allah is the one who compels us. We don't get to choose where we're born, who our parents are, our physical traits, or the quirks that make us uniquely us. We don't fully understand the intricacies of our anatomy, the beating of the heart, the firing of our nerves, and the conception of a new baby. All these details of perfection which we're unaware of are because Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ has compelled it to be that way. In Surah Yaseen, ""His command is only when He intends a thing that He says to it, 'Be,' and it is."" (Qur'an 36:82)A second meaning:There is a second meaning to Al-Jabbar: the one who restores, resets, or fixes our brokenness. He fixes by force and changes the state of something that is disordered and sets it right. Therefore, we can make du'a with this name when you want something in your life restored or fixed. Just as he compels a thing, He can put our lives in order. He is the only one who can mend what is broken, and restore what is lost.Reflection:When we come to know Al-Jabbar, we realize Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ as having extreme power, supremacy, strength over all His creation. Imam Al-Ghazali says, ""praised and exalted - for He compels each thing and nothing compels Him, and He has no competitor on either score."" In coming to realize this, we are subdued. We can no longer believe in our superiority. We understand that He is the one who elevated our rank. He benefits His creation but needs no benefitting Himself. This name can be a reminder not to inflate your ego and to avoid self-aggrandizement, ""Thus does Allah seal over every heart [belonging to] an arrogant tyrant."" (Qur'an 40:35)Supplications from Hadith:We should call upon this name for help in desperation. A cry to Al-Jabbar to remedy a broken heart, marriage, or confidence. In a weak hadith narration, ""Ibn Abbas narrated: 'Between the two prostrations, the Prophet would say: (Allahummaghfir li, warhamni, wajburni, wahdini, warzuqni). 'O Allah! Pardon me, have mercy on me, help me, guide me, and grant me sustenance.' [1] Here wajaburni means to help or rectify me - which aligns with the meaning of Al-Jabbar being the restorer/repairer. Although this narration is da'if (weak), the supplication is still very much relevant. A word of caution, repeating this in your prostration would be ritualizing something unsound, and it's not the way to reach definitive practices taught by rasulullah. If you do so because, at the moment, your heart desires to supplicate in prostration, and you recite this particular du'a because it comes to your mind, then that's fine. It's still a beneficial act that praises Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. The words of dhikr are still applicable, but ritually doing something off of a weak hadith is generally not advisable.In another narration from Hudhaifah: He prayed with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) one night, and he heard him say when he said the Takbir: ""Allahu Akbara dhal-jabaruti wal-malakuti wal-kibriya'i wal-'azamah (Allah is Most Great, the One Who has all power, sovereignty, magnificence and might)."" When bowing, he would say: ""Subhana Rabbiyal-'Azim (Glory be to my Lord Almighty)."" When he raised his head from bowing, he would say: ""Lirabbil-hamd, Lirabbil-hamd (To my Lord be praise, to my Lord be praise)."" And when he prostrated (he said): ""Subhana Rabbiyal-A'la (Glory be to my Lord Most High)."" And between the two prostrations (he said): ""Rabbighfirli, Rabbighfirli (Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me)."" His standing, his bowing, when he raised his head from bowing, his prostration, and the time between the two prostrations were almost the same.

الْمُتَكَبِّر,Al-Mutakabbir,The Dominant One,"The Tremendous, The Great, The Proud.","Al-Mutakabbir (in Arabic: ٱلْمُتَكَبِّرُ) means the supremely great one. He is exalted far above all creation, The One who is clear from the attributes of the creatures and from resembling them. He has rights, privileges, and qualities that others do not have. He is tremendous and manifests this greatness in all things and many ways.","From the root kaf-ba-ra (ك ب ر), which in Classical Arabic means: to be great in size, rank or dignity to be great in size, to be vast, formidable to be great in age, oldest to be great in dignity, noble, majestic to be great in learning, most known to have rights above all others.","Arabic Root:From the root kaf-ba-ra (ك ب ر), which in Classical Arabic means: to be great in size, rank or dignity to be great in size, to be vast, formidable to be great in age, oldest to be great in dignity, noble, majestic to be great in learning, most known to have rights above all others.What it means for Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ to be proud:The word Mutakabbir is derived from kabara meaning great, exalted, noble. Common translations of Al-Mutakabbir include ""The All Supreme,"" ""The Proud,"" ""The Dominant One,"" and ""The Great."" These are all valid and acceptable interpretations of the name. This name shows there is a vast distinction between Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ and all His creation. Everything pales in comparison. Thus, He is the supreme, the proud, the dominant one. He is the king of kings, and we are His servants unworthy of consideration in relation to Him. هُوَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِي لَآ إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ ٱلۡمَلِكُ ٱلۡقُدُّوسُ ٱلسَّلَٰمُ ٱلۡمُؤۡمِنُ ٱلۡمُهَيۡمِنُ ٱلۡعَزِيزُ ٱلۡجَبَّارُ ٱلۡمُتَكَبِّرُۚ سُبۡحَٰنَ ٱللَّهِ عَمَّا يُشۡرِكُونَHuwal-laahul-lazee laaa Ilaaha illaa Huwal-Malikul Quddoosus-Salaamul Muminul Muhaiminul-aAzeezul Jabbaarul-Mutakabbir; Subhaanal laahi Ammaa yushrikoonEnglish Translation:""He is Allah, other than whom there is no deity, the Sovereign, the Pure, the Perfection, the Bestower of Faith, the Overseer, the Exalted in Might, the Compeller, the Superior. Exalted is Allah above whatever they associate with Him."" — (Qur'an 59:23)The idea behind the name of Al-Mutakabbir, meaning ""The Proud,"" is that Allah alone possesses greatness; no one can compete with Him. Abu Sa'id Khudri and Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying: Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, said: Glory is His lower garment and Majesty is His cloak and (Allah says,) He who contends with Me in regard to them I shall torment him. [1]Now, if you were the best in a particular field or sport, we're talking complete domination; no one comes close to winning. Wouldn't you feel proud of your ability and achievements? In this regard, Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is said to be proud. Imam Ghazali explains Al-Mutakabbir as the one ""Who sees greatness and Majesty only in regard to himself, and looks upon others as a king looks upon his servants. And if his assessment be correct, he will be truly proud.""Avoid Arrogance:Note the emphasis on ""...if his assessment be correct"" imagine if the presumptions of greatness were false, then that person is due for a rude awakening. This is the story of Iblis. He was the first to claim arrogance. He believed he was great in exclusion of all else, and he was humiliated by Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. This danger looms true for all. Don't become arrogant, and believe in your superiority. Those who do fail to realize it was from Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ and not their own doing.Even Firawn, the king of Egypt, likened himself to a God. But where are all the caesars and dictators now? What empires still stand that honor, worship, and praise them daily? Their pride became arrogance which was based on faulty presumptions. They believed they had no one to answer to, ""Thus does Allah seal over every heart [belonging to] an (mutakabbirin jabbaar) arrogant tyrant."" (Qur'an 40:35) In the tafsir of Abul-Maududi it says of this verse, ""the seal is not set on the heart of anybody without a reason. This seal of curse is set only on the heart of the one who is filled with arrogance and spirit of violence and tyranny."" In another ayah, ""But Moses said, 'Indeed, I have sought refuge in my Lord and your Lord from every arrogant one who does not believe in the Day of Account."" (Qur'an 40:27)Reflection:A lesson to be learned is as you grow skilled in a field, it's natural that you'd get more confident. But when you start to think of yourself as an expert, you make yourself vulnerable, hence the saying, ""it's the strong swimmers who drown."" It's the strong swimmers who take more risks and, as a result, face fatal accidents. It's too late for them, and their fate is sealed. Similarly, what's better for the believer is to focus on finding truth. To avoid arrogance in thinking that they already know.The human condition is a desire to know, expand, and have power. It's hard to renounce all things - which, if you could, would be better. But that's the road less traveled. It's difficult and discomforting to assume you don't know or to admit you are uncertain. It feels reassuring to think you know something. But in this facade, you deprive yourself of going further. The tricky part of having poor judgment is you don't know when you have it. It's far better to find evidence in reality to support your view - and even then, not to draw conclusions. The moment you feel you know something, you allow yourself to stop searching. We all likely share a similar experience in studying for a test. You may have gone over a homework problem, looked at the answer, and thought, ""yeah that make sense"" or ""that's easy,"" and moved on. But when a similar question appeared on the test, we ""blanked out"" and couldn't answer it. Really we just fooled ourselves into thinking we knew and never got evidence to support that we really did. It would've been wise to test and practice, space out some time, and do it again. This way, we would not fool ourselves into thinking we knew something when we really didn't.To try and characterize oneself as being great and as feeling proud of their achievements in a non-conceited way, we can simplify it to the basic philosophy of doing your best. Be clear and deliberate in understanding what's important to you, and then try your best to live up to that standard. If you could go to bed every day knowing you've done your best, how can you not say you succeeded in what you set out to do? As a result of doing this over an extended period, you will surely get recognition from those closest to you, and perhaps it will shine through for others to see as well. But that part is something that will happen as a by-product, not as the goal for attainment. More important to ask how to be deserving of greatness rather than a desire for greatness.In another light, Al-Mutakabbir is also the one we can lean on when we are faced with an obstacle that seems insurmountable. It's a name that should inspire hope and optimism. As the Qur'an mentions: إِن يَنصُرۡكُمُ ٱللَّهُ فَلَا غَالِبَ لَكُمۡۖ وَإِن يَخۡذُلۡكُمۡ فَمَن ذَا ٱلَّذِي يَنصُرُكُم مِّنۢ بَعۡدِهِۦۗ وَعَلَى ٱللَّهِ فَلۡيَتَوَكَّلِ ٱلۡمُؤۡمِنُونَIny-yansurkumul laahu falaa ghaaliba lakum wa iny-yakhzulkum faman zal lazee yansurukum min ba'dih; wa ‘alal laahi falyatawakkalil mu'minoonEnglish Translation:""If Allah should aid you, no one can overcome you; but if He should forsake you, who is there that can aid you after Him? And upon Allah let the believers rely."" — (Qur'an 3:160)References:[1] Sahih (Al-Albani) Sunan Abi Dawud 4090 & Sahih Muslim 2620"
الْخَالِقُ,Al-Khaliq,The Creator,The One who brings everything from non-existence to existence.,"Al Khaaliq (in Arabic: ٱلْخَالِقُ) He is the one who creates things from nothing with no precedents. He creates what He pleases and in a perfect manner. He is the only one who determines when, how, and what to create and does so from nothing.","From the Arabic root kha-lam-qaf (خ ل ق), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to measure accurately, to determine the proper measure or proportion for something, to proportion one thing according to another, to create something based on a pattern or model which one has devised, to bring a thing into existence from non-existence.","Arabic Root:From the Arabic root kha-lam-qaf (خ ل ق), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to measure accurately, to determine the proper measure or proportion for something, to proportion one thing according to another, to create something based on a pattern or model which one has devised, to bring a thing into existence from non-existence.The names of creation:The name Al-Khaliq is mentioned in the Qur'an 8 times. The three names of creation, Al-Khaliq (The Creator), Al-Bari (The Producer), and Al-Musawwir (The Fashioner). These names may seem synonymous with Allah's ability to invent or create. But they are distinct names offering unique shades of meaning, bringing out different aspects to Allah's creating of creation. For example, these three names are often said to represent an order to His creation. First, you have Al-Khaliq, The Creator. He who produces something from nothing, i.e., He plans and creates. Secondly, He is Al-Bari, The Producer - the one who initiates and brings into existence. Lastly, He is Al-Musawwir, The Fashioner - He organizes and shapes the arrangement of the creation.What's amazing is these names are followed in this exact sequence based on their meaning in in the following ayah: هُوَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلۡخَٰلِقُ ٱلۡبَارِئُ ٱلۡمُصَوِّرُۖ لَهُ ٱلۡأَسۡمَآءُ ٱلۡحُسۡنَىٰۚ يُسَبِّحُ لَهُۥ مَا فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلۡأَرۡضِۖ وَهُوَ ٱلۡعَزِيزُ ٱلۡحَكِيمُHuwal Laahul Khaaliqul Baari ul Musawwir; lahul Asmaaa'ul Husnaa; yusabbihu lahoo maa fis samaawaati wal ardi wa Huwal Azeezul HakeemEnglish Translation:""He is Allah, the Creator, the Inventor, the Fashioner; to Him belong the best names. Whatever is in the heavens and earth is exalting Him. And He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise."" — (Qur'an 59:24)A useful analogy:Imam al-Ghazali compares these three names to the process of constructing a house. You have the planner, the builder, and the designer who gives it its final shape. Similarly, Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ takes on the three roles - the creator, producer, and the fashioner. However, the difference is we are not really inventing. Only Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ creates and He does so on an unimaginable scale. He creates from nothingness, whereas we are merely finding ways to transform material from one form to another. We are limited in what we can make, whereas Allah's creation is unbounded.No single creation exists without His willingness for it to be. Every one of Allah's creations has its origination with Him, and He gave it its form according to His divine knowledge and wisdom. ثُمَّ خَلَقۡنَا ٱلنُّطۡفَةَ عَلَقَةٗ فَخَلَقۡنَا ٱلۡعَلَقَةَ مُضۡغَةٗ فَخَلَقۡنَا ٱلۡمُضۡغَةَ عِظَٰمٗا فَكَسَوۡنَا ٱلۡعِظَٰمَ لَحۡمٗا ثُمَّ أَنشَأۡنَٰهُ خَلۡقًا ءَاخَرَۚ فَتَبَارَكَ ٱللَّهُ أَحۡسَنُ ٱلۡخَٰلِقِينَSumma khalaqnan nutfata alaqatan fakhalaqnal alaqata mudghatan fakhalaq nal mudghata izaaman fakasawnal izaama lahman summa anshaanaahu khalqan aakhar; fatabaarakal laahu ahsanul khaaliqeenEnglish Translation:""Then We made the sperm-drop into a clinging clot, and We made the clot into a lump [of flesh], and We made [from] the lump, bones, and We covered the bones with flesh; then We developed him into another creation. So blessed is Allah, the best of creators."" — (Qur'an 23:14)Note, in this verse it refers to Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ as ahsan al khaliqeen, meaning ""the best of creators"". It's also mentioned another time in Surah as-Saffat ayat 125.Note how, in the following ayah, it pairs these two attributes of His, i.e., He is Al-Khaliq, and Al-Alim (the knower). It signifies his ability to create in abundance and in accordance with His master plan. He creates perpetually and with a purpose. ""Did you imagine that We created you without any purpose, and that you will not be brought back to Us?"" (Qur'an 23:115) إِنَّ رَبَّكَ هُوَ ٱلۡخَلَّـٰقُ ٱلۡعَلِيمُInna Rabbaka Huwal khallaaqul ‘aleemEnglish Translation:""For verily it is thy Lord who is the Master-Creator, knowing all things."" — (Qur'an 15:86)Reflection:If we take a second to reflect on all of Allah's creations. How can a person be created from a small drop of fluid and have it manifest into 30 trillion cells that all work in unison, giving us life? If you gaze at the night sky, look at each tiny speck of light, each one of those is a giant star existing far away in some galaxy Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ has created. Yet here we are on this relatively small rock, floating through space, and it's the only one we know that is habitable. All the beauty in the world, and you get to experience it; Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ has allowed us to play a part in it. How can you not feel humble and appreciative of this very moment? The pessimist says, 'but think of all the fitnahs (i.e., trials or tests) of the world'. A person can look through a window and appreciate the beauty outside, but it is possible to fixate only on the specks that dirty the glass. Whatever you focus on, you will see.Further Reading: we did not include all the verses which mentions the name, Al-khaliq. If you'd like to read further, see 6:102, 13:16, 15:86, 36:81, 39:62, 40:62."

And He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise."" — (Qur'an 59:24)A useful analogy:Imam al-Ghazali compares these three names to the process of constructing a house. You have the planner, the builder, and the designer who gives it its final shape. Similarly, Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ takes on the three roles - the creator, producer, and the fashioner. However, the difference is we are not really inventing. Only Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ creates and He does so on an unimaginable scale. He creates from nothingness, whereas we are merely finding ways to transform material from one form to another. We are limited in what we can make, whereas Allah's creation is unbounded.Here you can read other verses which do not contain the name Al-Bari but furthr describe Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ as being the best of creators. ٱلَّذِي خَلَقَكَ فَسَوَّىٰكَ فَعَدَلَكَAllazee khalaqaka fasaw waaka fa'adalakEnglish Translation:""Who created you, proportioned you, and balanced you?"" — (Qur'an 82:7)Reflection:At times, we may feel insecure with our physical traits, but Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ tells us in the Qur'an that we've been created in the best moulds. لَقَدۡ خَلَقۡنَا ٱلۡإِنسَٰنَ فِيٓ أَحۡسَنِ تَقۡوِيمٖLaqad khalaqnal insaana fee ahsani taqweemEnglish Translation:""Verily, We created man of the best stature (mould),"" — (Qur'an 95:4)Start with Acceptance:This is a reminder that we should be thankful to Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ for the vessel He has granted us. We can not change it, nor should there be a desire to. Instead, we should learn to love it, look after it, and accept it for what it is. This process doesn't happen overnight; there's no guilt in not feeling great immediately. But, through studying deen, we understand Allah's attributes of how He is all-Knowing, doesn't make mistakes, and that He is the best of creators. We must then examine our insecurities and put them under a microscope. Here we will find that we are all perfectly imperfect. As a physical creation of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ we are designed perfectly; He created us how He intended. The suffering we experience in our self-image is of the mind, and this differs from reality. The ways we are imperfect are through our actions and the way we treat ourselves. These actions can erode self-respect and dignity - perhaps on a subconscious level. But, if we are honest, we can figure out what may be causing our unhappiness/uneasiness and seek to better ourselves. We don't have to deny our weaknesses; instead, we should embrace them. The Qur'an even tells us, ""man was created weak."" (Qur'an 4:28). وَتَرَى ٱلۡجِبَالَ تَحۡسَبُهَا جَامِدَةٗ وَهِيَ تَمُرُّ مَرَّ ٱلسَّحَابِۚ صُنۡعَ ٱللَّهِ ٱلَّذِيٓ أَتۡقَنَ كُلَّ شَيۡءٍۚ إِنَّهُۥ خَبِيرُۢ بِمَا تَفۡعَلُونَWa taral jibaala tahsabuhaa jaamidatanw wa hiya tamurru marras sahaab; sun'al laahil lazeee atqana kulla shai'; innahoo khabeerun bimaa taf'aloonEnglish Translation:""And you see the mountains, thinking them rigid, while they will pass as the passing of clouds. [It is] the work of Allah, who perfected all things. Indeed, He is Acquainted with that which you do."" — (Qur'an 27:88)Changing the goal:The journey starts with love. There will be less of an internal conflict to do the things you already know you should be doing the day you revitalize the love of self. It's hard to detach or untangle our current aspirations from what society has been telling us is important as it becomes indoctrinated. But this does not always align with what Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ loves to see in His servant. This is what it means to be fooled by the worldly life - the cars, the money, beauty standards, fame, or popularity. All these are superficial. You don't need to define yourself by these values. Instead, you can rewrite your story for confidence to be defined by your loving nature, piousness, devotion to Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ, your compassion, your mercy, your wisdom, your family values, and/or your hard-working and resourceful nature. Notice how all these are internal values that occur at the individual level. It doesn't involve other people or require an outwardly show of something. There is no competition with others. This makes it less glamorized and promoted in culture, as there's nothing for them to sell you and to make a profit on. If anything, perfecting oneself can make others feel inferior, so it's looked down on.Narrated Ibn Abbas: that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: ""Love Allah for what He nourishes you with of His Blessings, love me due to the love of Allah, and love the people of my house due to the love of me.""

الْمُصَوِّرُ,Al-Musawwir,The Flawless Shaper,"The Fashioner, The Bestower of Form, The Shaper of Unique Beauty","Allah is Al-Musawwir (in arabic: ٱلْمُصَوِّرُ), meaning He brings into existence whatever He wills and in whatever manner He wills it. He says, kun faya kun, “Be! and it is"". He is the fashioner of every creation and has given it a special form whereby it is distinguished.","From the root sad-waw-ra (ص و ر), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to make something incline, lean or bend towards, to form, fashion, sculpt, imagine or picture something, to have an inclination or desire towards something.","Arabic Root:From the root sad-waw-ra (ص و ر), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to make something incline, lean or bend towards, to form, fashion, sculpt, imagine or picture something, to have an inclination or desire towards something.The names of creation:The three names of creation, Al-Khaliq (The Creator), Al-Bari (The Producer), and Al-Musawwir (The Fashioner). These names may seem synonymous with Allah's ability to invent or create. But they are distinct names offering unique shades of meaning, bringing out different aspects to Allah's creating of creation. For example, these three names are often said to represent an order to His creation. First, you have Al-Khaliq, The Creator. He who produces something from nothing, i.e., He plans and creates. Secondly, He is Al-Bari, The Producer - the one who initiates and brings into existence. Lastly, He is Al-Musawwir, The Fashioner - He organizes and shapes the arrangement of the creation.What's amazing is these names are followed in this exact sequence based on their meaning in in the following ayah: هُوَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلۡخَٰلِقُ ٱلۡبَارِئُ ٱلۡمُصَوِّرُۖ لَهُ ٱلۡأَسۡمَآءُ ٱلۡحُسۡنَىٰۚ يُسَبِّحُ لَهُۥ مَا فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلۡأَرۡضِۖ وَهُوَ ٱلۡعَزِيزُ ٱلۡحَكِيمُHuwal Laahul Khaaliqul Baari ul Musawwir; lahul Asmaaa'ul Husnaa; yusabbihu lahoo maa fis samaawaati wal ardi wa Huwal Azeezul HakeemEnglish Translation:""He is Allah, the Creator, the Inventor, the Fashioner; to Him belong the best names.

He creates from nothingness, whereas we are merely finding ways to transform material from one form to another. We are limited in what we can make, whereas Allah's creation is unbounded.We've covered the only verse which explicitly mentions the name Al-Musawwir which establishes it as a name of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. The following verses further exemplify the quality of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ as being the fashioner: يَـٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلۡإِنسَٰنُ مَا غَرَّكَ بِرَبِّكَ ٱلۡكَرِيمِ ٱلَّذِي خَلَقَكَ فَسَوَّىٰكَ فَعَدَلَكَ فِيٓ أَيِّ صُورَةٖ مَّا شَآءَ رَكَّبَكَYaaa ayyuhal insaaanu maa gharraka bi Rabbikal kareem Allazee khalaqaka fasaw waaka fa'adalak Feee ayye sooratim maa shaaa'a rakkabakEnglish Translation:""O mankind, what has deceived you concerning your Lord, the Generous, Who created you, proportioned you, and balanced you?

You can read the benefits of knowing these names, as we already discussed in al-Khaliq and al-Bari. We can take with us a lesson from the life of Prophet Suleiman (as). Remember this as you read this next section, Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is the fashioner; he forms us unique and however, He pleases.Prophet Suleiman (as) was a wealthy King, ruling over the Israelites, loved by the people, and endowed with many unique abilities. The Qur'an says that he gifted ""the language of the birds."" We also learn that he could hear the ants when they spoke and that he could command the Jinn. Moreover, he was wise, ""And We had certainly given to David and Solomon knowledge"" (27:15). Do you think he cultivated this ability on his own? No, of course not. These are the gifts that only the creator can bestow. Prophet Suleiman (as) knew this himself, which is why he made the following du'a which we are told in Surah Naml: فَتَبَسَّمَ ضَاحِكٗا مِّن قَوۡلِهَا وَقَالَ  رَبِّ أَوۡزِعۡنِيٓ أَنۡ أَشۡكُرَ نِعۡمَتَكَ ٱلَّتِيٓ أَنۡعَمۡتَ عَلَيَّ وَعَلَىٰ وَٰلِدَيَّ وَأَنۡ أَعۡمَلَ صَٰلِحٗا تَرۡضَىٰهُ وَأَدۡخِلۡنِي بِرَحۡمَتِكَ فِي عِبَادِكَ ٱلصَّـٰلِحِينَFatabassama daahikam min qawlihaa wa qaala Rabbi awzi'nee an ashkura ni'mata kal lateee an'amta alaiya wa alaa waalidaiya wa an a'mala saalihan tardaahu wa adkhilnee birahmatika fee ibaadikas saaliheenEnglish Translation:""So [Solomon] smiled, amused at her speech, and said, 'My Lord, enable me to be grateful for Your favor which You have bestowed upon me and upon my parents and to do righteousness of which You approve. And admit me by Your mercy into [the ranks of] Your righteous servants.'"" — (Qur'an 27:19)The complete du'a of Prophet Suleiman (as) starts with the word Rabbi, meaning ""My Lord."" This du'a has been highlighted for your reference. In concluding on these three names of creation we accept, whether we deem a thing good or bad, it is all perfect because it is how Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ intended it to be, ""Such is Allah; He creates what He wills. When He decrees a matter, He only says to it, 'Be,' and it is."" (3:47)"
الْغَفَّارُ,al-Ghaffar,The Great-Forgiver,"The Forgiver, The Ever-Forgiving, The Most-Forgiving.","Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Ghaffar (in Arabic: ٱلْغَفَّارُ), He sees our sins and disobedience, yet He still forgives and accepts the repentance of the sincere. He shows never-ending compassion and forgiveness, no matter how big or small the sin. He is the most forgiving and loves to forgive.","From the root ghayn-fa-ra (غ ف ر), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to cover, veil, conceal, hide to pardon, to forgive, to set aright, to cover a thing, to protect it from dirt.","Arabic Root:From the root ghayn-fa-ra (غ ف ر), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to cover, veil, conceal, hide to pardon, to forgive, to set aright, to cover a thing, to protect it from dirt.The names Al-Ghaffar, Al-Ghaffur, and Al-Ghafir all refer to Allah's attribute of being forgiving. Together they have been mentioned a total of 97 times in the Qur'an. Of those 97 instances, the Qur'an mentions Al-Ghaffur 91 times, Al-Ghaffar 5 times, and Al-Ghafir just once.Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ loves to forgive:These names refer to Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ nature of being forgiving. He wants to forgive those who seek istighfar (forgiveness). Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, ""Allah, the Exalted, has said: 'O son of adam, I forgive you as long as you pray to Me and hope for My forgiveness, whatever sins you have committed. O son of 'Adam, I do not care if your sins reach the height of the heaven, then you ask for my forgiveness, I would forgive you. O son of 'Adam, if you come to Me with an earth load of sins, and meet Me associating nothing to Me, I would match it with an earthload of forgiveness.""' [1]From this hadith, we learn that it's never too late for someone who seeks the forgiveness of their Lord, even if their sins ""reach the height of the heaven."" Do not ever feel you are overburdening, asking for too much, or it's too late. This would be insulting to Allah's mercy, who is Al-Ghaffar, The Oft-Forgiving, the one who forgives perpetually. A person who has sinned should not despair of Allah's mercy. We are told in the following verse the one who sins has only wronged themselves when they disobey Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. They have not wronged Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ but cheated themselves out of some goodness. Like a person who cheats on a test. They may get a good grade in the class but will miss the benefit of having that knowledge and will pay the price in the real world. ۞قُلۡ يَٰعِبَادِيَ ٱلَّذِينَ أَسۡرَفُواْ عَلَىٰٓ أَنفُسِهِمۡ لَا تَقۡنَطُواْ مِن رَّحۡمَةِ ٱللَّهِۚ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَغۡفِرُ ٱلذُّنُوبَ جَمِيعًاۚ إِنَّهُۥ هُوَ ٱلۡغَفُورُ ٱلرَّحِيمُQul yaa'ibaadiyal lazeena asrafoo ‘alaaa anfusihim laa taqnatoo mirrahmatil laah; innal laaha yaghfiruz zunooba jamee'aa; innahoo Huwal Ghafoorur RaheemEnglish Translation:""Say, 'O My servants who have transgressed against themselves [by sinning], do not despair of the mercy of Allah. Indeed, Allah forgives all sins. Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiving, the Merciful.'"" — (Qur'an 39:53) فَقُلۡتُ ٱسۡتَغۡفِرُواْ رَبَّكُمۡ إِنَّهُۥ كَانَ غَفَّارٗاFaqultus taghfiroo Rabakum innahoo kaana GhaffaaraaEnglish Translation:""And said, ‘Ask forgiveness of your Lord. Indeed, He is ever a Perpetual Forgiver."" — (Qur'an 71:10)Even what's regarded as the unpardonable sin shirk (i.e., associating partners with Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ) can be forgiven. In the Qur'an, it says, ""Indeed, Allah does not forgive association with Him, but He forgives what is less than that for whom He wills. And he who associates others with Allah has certainly fabricated a tremendous sin"" (Qur'an 4:48) and in another verse, ""Indeed, Allah does not forgive association with Him, but He forgives what is less than that for whom He wills. And he who associates others with Allah has certainly gone far astray."" (Qur'an 4:116) But as other commentators have pointed out in Surah Az-Zumar, ""Indeed, Allah forgives all sins."" All the sahabah before the Prophet's time were considered mushrikeen, but they changed, they sought forgiveness, and Allah forgave them. The Qur'an only speaks of the person not being forgiven if they died having committed shirk (e.g., Prophet Ibrahim AS father who died a pagan) and chose to reject or deny Islam.The remaining Quranic verses that include the name Al-Ghaffar. وَإِنِّي لَغَفَّارٞ لِّمَن تَابَ وَءَامَنَ وَعَمِلَ صَٰلِحٗا ثُمَّ ٱهۡتَدَىٰWa innee la Ghaffaarul liman taaba wa aamana wa ‘amila saalihan summah tadaaEnglish Translation:""But indeed, I am the Perpetual Forgiver of whoever repents and believes and does righteousness and then continues in guidance."" — (Qur'an 20:82) رَبُّ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلۡأَرۡضِ وَمَا بَيۡنَهُمَا ٱلۡعَزِيزُ ٱلۡغَفَّـٰرُRabbus samaawaati wal ardi wa maa bainahumal Azeezul GhaffaarEnglish Translation:""Lord of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them, the Exalted in Might, the Perpetual Forgiver."" — (Qur'an 38:66) خَلَقَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلۡأَرۡضَ بِٱلۡحَقِّۖ يُكَوِّرُ ٱلَّيۡلَ عَلَى ٱلنَّهَارِ وَيُكَوِّرُ ٱلنَّهَارَ عَلَى ٱلَّيۡلِۖ وَسَخَّرَ ٱلشَّمۡسَ وَٱلۡقَمَرَۖ كُلّٞ يَجۡرِي لِأَجَلٖ مُّسَمًّىۗ أَلَا هُوَ ٱلۡعَزِيزُ ٱلۡغَفَّـٰرُKhalaqas samaawaati wal arda bilhaqq; yukawwirul laila ‘alan nahaari wa yukawwirun nahaara ‘alaal laili wa sakhkharash shamsa walqamara kulluny yajree li ajalim musammaa; alaa Huwal ‘Azeezul GhaffaarEnglish Translation:""He created the heavens and earth in truth. He wraps the night over the day and wraps the day over the night and has subjected the sun and the moon, each running [its course] for a specified term.

They have an inherent distrust in people, and so when their suspicion is confirmed - they are pleased. Others may find pleasure in seeing the fault in others as a way to avoid dealing with their deficiencies.What is better for the believer is to look for the good, just as Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ wants to forgive His servants. He wants those who make mistakes to rise above them, i.e., to seek His forgiveness and to be better because of it. We should give people the same opportunity. It does take being vulnerable to some extent, but that is not a weakness. Lead with love, trust, and compassion. Only once your kindness is taken advantage of should you review your terms of interaction with that particular individual. Be oft-forgiving and avoid growing bitter towards humanity at large.References:[1] Riyad as-Salihin 442[2] Sahih Muslim 2590b & Sahih (Al-Albani) Sunan Abi Dawud 4893"
الْقَهَّارُ,Al-Qahhar,The All-Prevailing One,"The Dominantor, The Irrestible, The Subduer","Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Qahhar (in Arabic: ٱلْقَهَّارُ), meaning the one who prevails over all creation. The universe runs according to the laws laid down by Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. He is dominant, the master of all, and is victorious over all opposition. He has the perfect Power and is not unable over anything.","From the root qaf-ha-ra (ق ه ر), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to overcome, conquer to overpower, master to dominate over, prevail to subdue, subjugate, to compel against one’s wishes.","Arabic Root:From the root qaf-ha-ra (ق ه ر), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to overcome, conquer to overpower, master to dominate over, prevail to subdue, subjugate, to compel against one's wishes.The names Al-Qahhar and Al-Qahir:There are two names, Al-Qahir, and Al-Qahhar. The name Al-Qahir is the base form meaning ""the irresistible."" On the other hand, Al-Qahhar is more emphatic, the one who is all over-powering, all-prevailing. Al-Qahir is mentioned twice in the Qur'an in Surah al-An'am verse 18 and verse 61. while Al-Qahhar is used more intensively, mentioned a total of 6 times.This name informs us that Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ strength is unmatched. He has absolute sovereignty over all His creation. He is the dominator. Whoever is an enemy or challenges Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ stands no chance. He can humiliate them with ease. Things are measured on the scale of eternity, so if a person opposes Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ they will lose inevitably. There isn't a single creation that isn't subjected to Allah's will or could escape it.The pairing of Al-Qahhar with Al-Wahid:In the Qur'an, this name is also always coupled with the name Al-Wahid, meaning ""The One."" A king in this world can be powerful, but it's not because he possesses intrinsic power. It often comes with the buy-in of the state citizens or having a large army. If they were to turn on him, he would have no power. So this pairing of names shows the difference, He is one with complete dominion over all. We again see how the holistic approach of studying the names in their pairs brings light to a new meaning that we otherwise might've missed. قُلۡ إِنَّمَآ أَنَا۠ مُنذِرٞۖ وَمَا مِنۡ إِلَٰهٍ إِلَّا ٱللَّهُ ٱلۡوَٰحِدُ ٱلۡقَهَّارُQul innamaaa ana munzirunw wa maa min laahin illal laahul Waahidul QahhaarEnglish Translation:""Say, [O Muhammad], 'I am only a warner, and there is not any deity except Allah, the One, the Prevailing.'"" — (Qur'an 38:65) يَٰصَٰحِبَيِ ٱلسِّجۡنِ ءَأَرۡبَابٞ مُّتَفَرِّقُونَ خَيۡرٌ أَمِ ٱللَّهُ ٱلۡوَٰحِدُ ٱلۡقَهَّارُYaa saahibayis sijni ‘a-arbaabum mutafarriqoona khayrun amil laahul waahidul qahhaarEnglish Translation:""O [my] two companions of prison, are separate lords better or Allah, the One, the Prevailing?"" — (Qur'an 12:39) قُلۡ مَن رَّبُّ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلۡأَرۡضِ قُلِ ٱللَّهُۚ قُلۡ أَفَٱتَّخَذۡتُم مِّن دُونِهِۦٓ أَوۡلِيَآءَ لَا يَمۡلِكُونَ لِأَنفُسِهِمۡ نَفۡعٗا وَلَا ضَرّٗاۚ قُلۡ هَلۡ يَسۡتَوِي ٱلۡأَعۡمَىٰ وَٱلۡبَصِيرُ أَمۡ هَلۡ تَسۡتَوِي ٱلظُّلُمَٰتُ وَٱلنُّورُۗ أَمۡ جَعَلُواْ لِلَّهِ شُرَكَآءَ خَلَقُواْ كَخَلۡقِهِۦ فَتَشَٰبَهَ ٱلۡخَلۡقُ عَلَيۡهِمۡۚ قُلِ ٱللَّهُ خَٰلِقُ كُلِّ شَيۡءٖ وَهُوَ ٱلۡوَٰحِدُ ٱلۡقَهَّـٰرُQul mar Rabbus samaawaati wal ard; qulillaah; qul afattakhaztum min dooniheee awliyaaa'a laa yamlikoona li anfusihim naf'anw wa laa darraa; qul hal yastawil a'maa wal baseeru am hal tastawiz zulumaatu wannoor; am ja'aloo lillaahi shurakaaa'a khalaqoo kakhalqihee fatashaa bahal khalqu ‘alaihim; qulil laahu Khaaliqu kulli shai'inw wa Huwal Waahidul QahharEnglish Translation:Say, “Who is Lord of the heavens and earth?” Say, “Allah.” Say, “Have you then taken besides Him allies not possessing [even] for themselves any benefit or any harm?” Say, “Is the blind equivalent to the seeing?

الْوَهَّابُ,Al-Wahhab,The Supreme Bestower,The One who is abundantly generous in giving without ever needing to calculate.,"Allah is Al Wahhab (in Arabic: ٱلْوَهَّابُ), which means the great giver whose blessings are freely and perpetually given. He gives with no purpose and expects nothing in return. Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is truly the most liberal giver, He gives to the deserving and undeserving, to the good and the evil.","From the root waw-ha-ba (و ه ب), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to give for no compensation, to give as a gift, to donate, to offer as a present, to bestow, or to give liberally and freely.","Arabic Root:From the root waw-ha-ba (و ه ب), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to give for no compensation, to give as a gift, to donate, to offer as a present, to bestow, or to give liberally and freely.The gift of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ:The name Al-Wahhab is mentioned three times in the Qur'an and comes from al-hibah, which is a gift detached without conditions or prior cause. This name speaks to Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ nature of being the all endowering, all bestowing, or the perpetual giver of gifts. Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ loves His creation intimately, He gives without recompense or interests. In Surah Ibrahim verse 34, ""And if you should count the favor of Allah, you could not enumerate them. Indeed, mankind is [generally] most unjust and ungrateful.""Give yourself a moment to reflect, look all around you, look at the complexity of your body. We can not show enough appreciation to Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ for all of His blessings. The gift of life, how each cell everyday is at war, it wards off viruses and bacteria that want to destroy it. Yet here you are. Every moment we are living and its because Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ has written it to be that way. He sustains us in every moment and we are unaware and unknowing. أَمۡ عِندَهُمۡ خَزَآئِنُ رَحۡمَةِ رَبِّكَ ٱلۡعَزِيزِ ٱلۡوَهَّابِAm'indahum khazaaa inu rahmati Rabbikal Azeezil WahhabEnglish Translation:""Do they possess the treasures of your Lord, the Most Mighty, the Great Bestower?"" — (Qur'an 38:9)The pairing with the name Al-Wahhab:When the names of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ are paired it often conveys a greater message. In this case, the names Al-Azeez (The Exalted / The Mighty) is paired with Al-Wahhab. This signals the purity of the gift. Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is The All Mighty, He does not need anything, so when He gives, He gives freely. There is no ulterior motive, no looking to get in someone's favor. Unlike humans, we understand there's an unspoken social contract to reciprocate the giving. If someone invites you to their wedding, you feel almost compelled or obligated to invite them to yours. Allah is greater. He just gives and gives without any limits.The pairing of these two names also shows how nothing can come in the way of His giving. We live in a world where politics, leadership, and logistics all come in the way, preventing good people from helping one another. The wealthiest countries in the world still have some degree of the population suffering from poverty and hunger, and it's not because of a lack of resources. Even if they wanted to help, they could not. Allah's bounties have no limits, and no one can prevent Him from Giving to whom He wills.Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ does not need anything from His servants. We know His gifts are purely out of His generosity and kindness. They serve as a reminder of His love for all His creation. He even gives to those who might not be deserving; perhaps they would realize that their Lord is showering them with many blessings and that they return to Him. This would be a gift within a gift - He gives so you can get to know Him, leading us to seek His approval and mercy.Prophetic supplication with this name:If you wish to call upon this beautiful name of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ we can learn the du'a Prophet Suleiman (as) recited asking for forgivness and wealth. قَالَ رَبِّ ٱغۡفِرۡ لِي وَهَبۡ لِي مُلۡكٗا لَّا يَنۢبَغِي لِأَحَدٖ مِّنۢ بَعۡدِيٓۖ إِنَّكَ أَنتَ ٱلۡوَهَّابُQaala Rabbigh fir lee wa hab lee mulkal laa yambaghee li ahadin min ba'dee innaka Antal WahhaabEnglish Translation:""He said, 'My Lord, forgive me and grant me a kingdom such as will not belong to anyone after me. Indeed, You are the Bestower.'"" — (Qur'an 38:35)Reflection:This name should also make us realize that our success is only through Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. Whatever good you do, who inspired that impulse within you? Who records and rewards the good one does? It's all from Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. He is not obliged in any way, and He does whatever He wishes. But through learning about Allah's divine names, we learn about His justice, generosity, and abundance, as well as His care, love, and forgiveness. These are all gifts of Al-Wahhab.Upon further reflection on this name, we may also realize that any inherent skills/qualities we have are also a gift from Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. Don't let your nafs (i.e., ego) intrude and take control over your heart. We do that in part by remaining thankful to Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ because we did nothing to be deserving of His gifts. He just gives, period. No questions asked, no ""please sign here on the dotted line."" He then leaves us with the choice to take it for granted or to be grateful. It's on us to see His kindness and His mercy.Narrated Uqba: I offered the Asr prayer behind the Prophet (ﷺ) at Medina. When he had finished the prayer with Taslim, he got up hurriedly and went out by crossing the rows of the people to one of the dwellings of his wives. The people got scared at his speed. The Prophet (ﷺ) came back and found the people surprised at his haste and said to them, ""I remembered a piece of gold Lying in my house and I did not like it to divert my attention from Allah's worship, so I have ordered it to be distributed (in charity). [1]The gift in you:Let's say you gave a gift to a friend, and you see it wasn't appreciated, used, or had the opposite effect you intended - how would you feel? The truth is it hurts. Imagine a recent kidney donor seeing their friend revert back to being an alcoholic. It would be a big slap in the face. Similarly, Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ has given certain people gifts that get abused. We have knowledgeable people, but they use their knowledge to manipulate and cheat others. In the act of omission, Allah's given us the faculty to achieve great things, but we don't live up to our potential. Instead, we get caught up and waste time playing meaningless games. We must try our best to use the gifts Allah's given us in a way that would not insult the giver. We should use our gifts to spread goodness to try and uplift and benefit others.Just as Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ gives gifts out of love we should learn to do the same. ""Aishah narrated: 'The Prophet would accept gifts and he would give something in return.'"" [2]Abu Huraira reported that the Prophet ﷺ said, ""Give gifts and you will love one another."" [3] And just as a reminder, no gift is too small. Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, ""O Muslim women! No one of you should consider insignificant (a gift) to give to her neighbour even if it is (a gift of) the trotters of a sheep"".

الرَّزَّاقُ,Ar-Razzaq,The Total Provider,"The Provider, The Sustainer. The one who creates sustenance for all His creations.","Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Ar-Razzaq (in Arabic: ٱلْرَّزَّاقُ) The Provider, The Sustainer for all His creatures. He is The One who creates all means of nourishment and gives them their livelihood. He is the provider of growth for all things good for the body, the soul, and the mind.",":From the root ra-zay-qaf (ر ز ق), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to receive something beneficial, especially as a gift to be provided with the necessities of life, to receive a portion, share or lot, to be supplied with a means of subsistence.","Arabic Roots:From the root ra-zay-qaf (ر ز ق), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to receive something beneficial, especially as a gift to be provided with the necessities of life, to receive a portion, share or lot, to be supplied with a means of subsistence.The difference between Ar-Razzaq and Al-Wahhab:There is often confusion between the names Al-Wahhab (The Bestower) and Ar-Razzaq (The Provider). Al-Wahhab contains the same root as the name Hiba, which means a gift. So, Al-Wahhab refers to Allah's attribute of being the perpetual giver of gifts. It knows no bounds and requires no action from the receiver. Now, rizq has multiple meanings; the first is of general sustenance. This refers to any physical or material wealth. It's what has been allocated by the creator for you. However, unlike a gift, effort must be applied to receive it. This encompasses the outward definition of rizq. Rizq can also apply to inward sustenance - one that benefits your soul, your heart (emotional sustenance), your faith, and your health. When you count on Allah's سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ blessings, seek the rizq that will purify your soul, guide you, and increase your imaan for it is nobler. The inward sustenance is ever-lasting, whereas material provision, although necessary, is only temporary.A lesson from Prophet Ibrahim (as):In the Qur'an, Surah Ash-Shu'ara, Prophet Ibrahim (as) addresses Polytheists giving reasons why Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ should be the only one worthy of worship. He argues how it is Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ, ""Who created me and Who guides me; Who gives me food and drink, and Who, when I am ill, heals me; Who will cause me to die and then will again restore me to life."" (Qur'an 26:78-81) What's interesting to note here is the order of things mentioned. Prophet Ibrahim (as) first shows appreciation for his existence and to be among those Allah guided. He only then shifts to the outward rizq of worldly provisions such as food, drink, and health.The name mentioned in the Qur'an:There are countless ayat which discuss Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ as being The Provider. For example, ""Allah is the one who created you, then provided for you, then will cause you to die, and then will give you life. Are there any of your 'partners' who does anything of that? Exalted is He and high above what they associate with Him"" (Qur'an 30:40) and also, ""O mankind, remember the favor of Allah upon you. Is there any creator other than Allah who provides for you from the heaven and earth? There is no deity except Him, so how are you deluded?"" (Qur'an 35:3) But as a reference to the name Ar-Razzaq there is only one instance: وَمَا خَلَقْتُ ٱلْجِنَّ وَٱلْإِنسَ إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُونِ مَآ أُرِيدُ مِنْهُم مِّن رِّزْقٍۢ وَمَآ أُرِيدُ أَن يُطْعِمُونِ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ هُوَ ٱلرَّزَّاقُ ذُو ٱلْقُوَّةِ ٱلْمَتِينُWa maa khalaqtul jinna wal insa illaa liya'budoon Maaa ureedu minhum mir rizqinw wa maaa ureedu anyyut'imoon Innal laaha Huwar Razzaaqu Zul Quwwatil MateenEnglish Translation:""And I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me. I do not want from them any provision, nor do I want them to feed Me. Indeed, it is Allah who is the [continual] Provider, the firm possessor of strength."" — (Qur'an 51:56-58)The pairing of Ar-Razzaq and Al-Mateen:The pairing here is with the two names Ar-Razzaq and Al-Mateen, the perpetual provider and the firm possessor of strength. We can always depend on Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ for provision because He is the firm one. What does it mean to be firm? It means being solid, unwavering, or unbreakable. You can forever rely on Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ because of His strength. All other sources that claim to be strong providers really are not. The greatest countries or empires all rise and fall, and the biggest companies of the past are now bankrupt. Nothing is ever-lasting except Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. He is unshakable. قُلْ مَن يَرْزُقُكُم مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَـٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ ۖ قُلِ ٱللَّهُ ۖ وَإِنَّآ أَوْ إِيَّاكُمْ لَعَلَىٰ هُدًى أَوْ فِى ضَلَـٰلٍۢ مُّبِينٍۢQul mai yarzuqukum minas samaawaati wal ardi qulil laahu wa innaaa aw iyyaakum la'alaa hudan aw fee dalaalim mubeenEnglish Translation:""Say, 'Who provides for you from the heavens and the earth?' Say, 'Allah. And indeed, we or you are either upon guidance or in clear error.'"" — (Qur'an 34:24)Is your Rizq decreed?It was Narrated Abdullah who recorded Allah's Messenger ﷺ as saying, ""...then Allah sends an angel and orders him to write four things, i.e., his provision, his age, and whether he will be of the wretched or the blessed (in the Hereafter). Then the soul is breathed into him."" [1]If your rizq is decreed, why make du'a? This question is often asked, and it's rather a moot point. Allah's qadr (divine decree) is known only by Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. We don't know what was written, and as mentioned previously, to receive worldly rizq still requires genuine effort. We simply don't know; it could be after reading this, you make du'a asking from Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ, and He increases what has been portioned for you. Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ had already known this as it was in your qadr. It was written, but you did not know. So we proceed just as we would before, doing good deeds, making du'a, and putting our best foot forward. The rest is with Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. أَمَّنۡ هَٰذَا ٱلَّذِي يَرۡزُقُكُمۡ إِنۡ أَمۡسَكَ رِزۡقَهُۥۚ بَل لَّجُّواْ فِي عُتُوّٖ وَنُفُورٍAmman haazal lazee yarzuqukum in amsaka rizqah; bal lajjoo fee utuwwinw wa nufoorEnglish Translation:""Or who is it that could provide for you if He withheld His provision? But they have persisted in insolence and aversion."" — (Qur'an 67:21)Reflection:At some biological level, we have this looming anxiety of not having enough. We're afraid of losing our job, being unable to pay our bills, or not having enough to eat. We live with this constant angst and worry.The release can come from knowing Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Ar-Razzaq. He is the best provider for all; there is not a single creature that Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ does not provide for. Since He is the only one who can give sustenance, we should seek it from Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. Understanding this frees a person from the shackles of the influence of an unjust employer, dictator, or any kind of authority. People may be coerced to compromise their morals and resort to cheating and stealing to secure sustenance. But the one who knows Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ as Ar-Razzaq will avoid acting in this way as he knows the absolute authority is with Allah, The Almighty.Narrated Warrad: (the clerk of Al-Mughira bin Shu`ba) Once Al-Mughira dictated to me in a letter addressed to Muawiya that the Prophet ﷺ used to say after every compulsory prayer, ""La ilaha illa l-lahu wahdahu la sharika lahu, lahu l-mulku wa lahu l-hamdu, wa huwa `ala kulli shay'in qadir. Allahumma la mani`a lima a`taita, wa la mu`tiya lima mana`ta, wa la yanfa`u dhal-jaddi minka l-jadd. [There is no Deity but Allah, Alone, no Partner to Him. His is the Kingdom and all praise, and Omnipotent is he. O Allah! Nobody can hold back what you gave, nobody can give what You held back, and no struggler's effort can benefit against You]."" And Al-Hasan said, ""Al-jadd' means prosperity [??]."" [2]The attitude which is best for a believer to adopt was mentioned in the hadith of Sahih Muslim. Abu Hurairah narrated that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: ""Look at those who are beneath you and do not look at those who are above you, for it is more suitable that you should not consider as less the blessing of Allah."" [3] This problem has multiplied a thousandfold in the age of social media. We see the highlight reel of everyone's best life. It then leads to shaitan planting his seeds of doubt in the garden of your mind. These weeds - if not dealt with immediately - take form and spread, soon overtaking the entire garden. This manifests in a variety of ways into doubt, resentment, or belittling the favors which Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ has given us (nauzubillah). For those seeking tranquility, it is better to find contentment with that which Allah has already provided you. This sentiment is perfectly captured in Surah Ta-ha verse 131, ""And do not extend your eyes toward that by which We have given enjoyment to [some] categories of them, [its being but] the splendor of worldly life by which We test them. And the provision of your Lord is better and more enduring.""It was narrated from Salamah bin ‘Ubaidullah bin Mihsan Al-Ansari that his father said: ""The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'Whoever among you wakes up physically healthy, feeling safe and secure within himself, with food for the day, it is as if he acquired the whole world.'"" [4]References:[1] Sahih al-Bukhari 6594[2] Sahih al-Bukhari 844[3] Sahih (Darussalam) Sunan Ibn Majah 4142[4] Hasan (Darussalam) Sunan Ibn Majah 4141"
الْفَتَّاحُ,Al-Fattah,The Opener / The Judge,"The Opener, The Solver, The Victory Giver.","Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Fattah (in Arabic: ٱلْفَتَّاحُ), meaning the opener, the revealer, and the granter of success. He opens or locks His doors of mercy to whom He pleases. Through His guidance, whatever is unclear becomes clear. Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ has the best judgment and holds the keys to victory and success.","From the root fa-ta-ha (ف ت ح), which means to open. It has the following classical Arabic connotations: to open, unlock, unfold, to make victorious, to reveal, inform, explain, make clear, to judge, to decide, to grant, and to permit.","Arabic Root:From the root fa-ta-ha (ف ت ح), which means to open. It has the following classical Arabic connotations: to open, unlock, unfold, to make victorious, to reveal, inform, explain, make clear, to judge, to decide, to grant, and to permit.The Opener:There are multiple meanings associated with this name. In Arabic, fath (فتح) means to open, and Al-Fattah (ٱلْفَتَّاحُ) is The Opener. This name takes on a perpetual form that is ever-lasting. He is the one that is always doing this again and again. Now, what is implied by the opening? What is that He opens? As we covered in the last name, Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ holds the key to our sustenance (Ar-Razzaq), so naturally, He is considered the opener to provisions.He is also the one who opens the door of mercy. Narrated by Abu Huraira, who reported Allah's Messenger ﷺ as saying: When it is the month of Ramadan, the gates of mercy are opened, and the gates of Hell are locked and the devils are chained. [1]It can also mean providing guidance to one who is lost, revealing the unseen, a path untrodden. Sometimes we see things as impossible. Our minds were unable to see it in a different light. But that is until Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ, in all His glory, clears our minds and opens the possibility for us. We are blinded and unable to see, i.e., until He reveals. So, we learn that Al-Fattah is the one who makes what seemed once impossible possible.Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ also opens the doors to His tests for both the believers and those who don't believe. He may open access to fame, wealth, or power just to see how we respond. For others, He may take it away. In the Qur'an, it mentions, ""So when they forgot that by which they had been reminded, We opened to them the doors of every [good] thing until, when they rejoiced in that which they were given, We seized them suddenly, and they were [then] in despair."" (Qur'an 6:44)Al-Fattah in the Qur'an:Moving onto the instances of the name Al-Fattah as mentioned in the Qur'an. It appears only once; however, many verses exemplify this attribute of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. Below is the ayah in which this name was revealed. قُلْ يَجْمَعُ بَيْنَنَا رَبُّنَا ثُمَّ يَفْتَحُ بَيْنَنَا بِٱلْحَقِّ وَهُوَ ٱلْفَتَّاحُ ٱلْعَلِيمُQul yajma'u bainanaa Rabbunaa summa yaftahu bainanaa bilhaqq; wa Huwal Fattaahul AleemEnglish Translation:Say, ""Our Lord will bring us together; then He will judge between us in truth. And He is the Knowing Judge."" — (Qur'an 34:26)Reflection:By being vulnerable to oneself, by opening up towards Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ you give yourself the opportunity for Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ to open His doors of mercy for you. Abu Hurairah narrated that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: ""Indeed Allah Most High says: 'I am as My slave thinks of Me, and I am with him when He calls upon Me.'""  [2]From this name, we further recognize that Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is the only one we need to rely upon. Whatever it is we need access to, Al-Fattah is the one who can open it for us. If you're feeling stuck or struggling to make a decision, pray salat al-istikhara. Ask Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ to open your heart to make the right choice. He is the best judge who knows whether a thing will benefit you in your deen, relationship, or livelihood.The Prophet ﷺ recommended that when we enter the masjid, we should make this du'a, اللَّهُمَّ افْتَحْ لِي أَبْوَابَ رَحْمَتِكَ Allahumma-iftah li abwaba rahmatik which means, ""O Allah! Open for me the gates of Your mercy!"" [3] This beautiful du'a keeps in mind that when we enter a masjid, we seek to experience Allah's mercy. This dhikr is an active remembrance of this fact. It asks Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ directly to open His gates of mercy for us.The hadith then continues, ""And when he leaves (the masjid), let him say: اللَّهُمَّ إِنِّي أَسْأَلُكَ مِنْ فَضْلِكَ Allahumma inni as'aluka min fadlika, meaning 'O Allah, I ask of you from Your bounty.'"" The lesson is, when you enter a masjid, seek His mercy and look towards your afterlife, but when you leave, seek His grace and bounty so you can succeed in this Dunya. مَّا يَفْتَحِ ٱللَّهُ لِلنَّاسِ مِن رَّحْمَةٍۢ فَلَا مُمْسِكَ لَهَا ۖ وَمَا يُمْسِكْ فَلَا مُرْسِلَ لَهُۥ مِنۢ بَعْدِهِۦ ۚ وَهُوَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْحَكِيمُMaa yaftahil laahu linnaaasi mir rahmatin falaa mumsika lahaa wa maa yumsik falaa mursila lahoo mimba'dihi; wa Huwal Azeezul HakeemEnglish Translation:""Whatever Allah grants to people of mercy - none can withhold it; and whatever He withholds - none can release it thereafter. And He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise."" — (Qur'an 35:2)Imam al-Ghazali writes to characterize oneself as Abdul-Fattah, ""man should yearn to reach a point where the locks to the divine mysteries are opened by his speech, and where he might facilitate by his knowledge what creatures find difficult in religious and wordly affairs."" Being relentless in figuring out the answers in whatever specialty and then sharing this knowledge with others. Kick down the doors and let people in. Share the knowledge and experiences of your life with others — the good and the bad, as both are equally instructive.References:[1] Sahih Muslim 1079b[2] Sahih al-Bukhari 7405[3] Sahih (Darussalam) Sunan Ibn Majah 772"
اَلْعَلِيْمُ,Al-Alim / Al-Aleem,The All-Knowing One,"The Knowledgeable, The Omniscient One, The Knower","Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Alim (in Arabic: العليم), meaning the one whose knowledge is comprehensive and extends to all that is seen and unseen, apparent and hidden, present and future, near and far. His knowledge precedes, and He is intuitively aware of all things, even before they happen. He is the knower of all details, and nothing goes unnoticed or unrecorded. Indeed, He is the Omniscient One.","From the root ayn-lam-mim (ع ل م), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to have knowledge, be cognizant, be certain, to be aware, thoroughly informed, to find out, gather information, to have intuitive knowledge, or to be firmly rooted in knowledge, to know the minutiae, to be wise and act according to knowledge.","Arabic Root:From the root ayn-lam-mim (ع ل م), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to have knowledge, be cognizant, be certain, to be aware, thoroughly informed, to find out, gather information, to have intuitive knowledge, or to be firmly rooted in knowledge, to know the minutiae, to be wise and act according to knowledge.The word Alim means knower and is derived from the Arabic ilm meaning knowledge. Al-Alim and Al-Aleem take on the grandeur form of being The Knower, The All-Knowing, The Omniscient. This attribute helps us understand how Allah's knowledge is complete and all-encompassing; He knows the beginning, the ending, and everything that's kept within. He is not only aware of our outward actions but knows the state of our hearts when we make them. Nothing is kept a secret, and nothing can be hidden from His knowledge. وَقَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لَا تَأۡتِينَا ٱلسَّاعَةُۖ قُلۡ بَلَىٰ وَرَبِّي لَتَأۡتِيَنَّكُمۡ عَٰلِمِ ٱلۡغَيۡبِۖ لَا يَعۡزُبُ عَنۡهُ مِثۡقَالُ ذَرَّةٖ فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَلَا فِي ٱلۡأَرۡضِ وَلَآ أَصۡغَرُ مِن ذَٰلِكَ وَلَآ أَكۡبَرُ إِلَّا فِي كِتَٰبٖ مُّبِينٖWa qaalal lazeena kafaroo laa taateenas Saa'ah; qul balaa wa Rabbee lataatiyannakum Aalimul Ghaib; laa ya'zubu anhu misqaalu zarratin fis samaawaati wa laa fil ardi wa laaa asgharu min zaalika wa laaa akbaru illaa fee kitaabim mubeenEnglish Translation:""But those who disbelieve say, 'The Hour will not come to us.' Say, 'Yes, by my Lord, it will surely come to you. [Allah is] the Knower of the unseen.' Not absent from Him is an atom's weight within the heavens or within the earth or [what is] smaller than that or greater, except that it is in a clear register -"" — (Qur'an 34:3)Al-Aleem appears 157 times in the Qur'an and its variations 17 times. This name is often mentioned in pairs with other names in the Qur'an quite frequently. This provides deeper insight, negates any deficiency, and shows perfection in His names.Name Pairings# of TimesAl-Hakeem (The Wise)36Al-Wasi (The Vast)7Al-Aziz (The Eminent)4Al-Qadir (The Powerful)4Al-Khabir (The All-Aware)4Al-Haleem (The Indulgent)3Al- (The Eminent)2Ash-Shakur (Grateful)2Al-Khaliq (The Creator)2Al-Fattah (The Opener)1*These are just some of the more common pairings.Then there exist many variants of the root word ilm, which include Allaamul, A'lam, Alim, and Aleem. Whenever these qualities are mentioned to describe Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ it is to show how His knowledge is absolute and complete. There is nothing lacking in His knowledge. ۞يَوۡمَ يَجۡمَعُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلرُّسُلَ فَيَقُولُ مَاذَآ أُجِبۡتُمۡۖ قَالُواْ لَا عِلۡمَ لَنَآۖ إِنَّكَ أَنتَ عَلَّـٰمُ ٱلۡغُيُوبِyawma yajma'ul laahur Rusula fa yaqoolu maazaaa ujibtum qaaloo laa ilma lanaa innaka Anta Allaamul GhuyoobEnglish Translation:""[Be warned of] the Day when Allah will assemble the messengers and say, 'What was the response you received?' They will say, 'We have no knowledge. Indeed, it is You who is Knower of the unseen'"" — (Qur'an 5:109)What is human knowledge:Man's knowledge often comes through experience and failures. We learn by iterating. We accumulate this knowledge by writing books to store this information so as to not forget. We then pass down our learning from generation to generation, revising and building upon past works as we go along. We may try to describe Allah's knowledge, but we won't truly understand the extent of its vastness. As Imam al-Ghazali mentions, Allah's knowledge ""is not derived from things known, rather things unknown are derived from it."" Everything that is, is because Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ has willed it. He is the Creator and the source for everything, whereas we merely make observations. Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ knows and remembers the tiniest details of things, nothing happens in the universe without His knowledge, and He never forgets any of it. And this is just one layer of His infinite knowledge. What happens in this universe is just a linear timeline of events unfolding. His knowledge extends to the infinite possibilities of all the things that could've happened. وَعِندَهُۥ مَفَاتِحُ ٱلْغَيْبِ لَا يَعْلَمُهَآ إِلَّا هُوَ ۚ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا فِى ٱلْبَرِّ وَٱلْبَحْرِ ۚ وَمَا تَسْقُطُ مِن وَرَقَةٍ إِلَّا يَعْلَمُهَا وَلَا حَبَّةٍۢ فِى ظُلُمَـٰتِ ٱلْأَرْضِ وَلَا رَطْبٍۢ وَلَا يَابِسٍ إِلَّا فِى كِتَـٰبٍۢ مُّبِينٍۢWa indahoo mafaatihul ghaibi laa ya'lamuhaaa illaa Hoo; wa ya'lamu maa fil barri walbahr; wa maa tasqutu minw waraqatin illaa ya'lamuhaa wa laa habbatin fee zulumaatil ardi wa laa ratbinw wa laa yaabisin illaa fee Kitaabim MubeenEnglish Translation:""And with Him are the keys of the unseen; none knows them except Him. And He knows what is on the land and in the sea. Not a leaf falls but that He knows it. And no grain is there within the darknesses of the earth and no moist or dry [thing] but that it is [written] in a clear record."" — (Qur'an 6:59) قَالَ عِلْمُهَا عِندَ رَبِّى فِى كِتَـٰبٍۢ ۖ لَّا يَضِلُّ رَبِّى وَلَا يَنسَىQaala ilmuhaa inda Rabee fee kitaab, laa yadillu Rabbee wa laa yansaaEnglish Translation:""[Moses] said, 'The knowledge thereof is with my Lord in a record. My Lord neither errs nor forgets.'"" — (Qur'an 20:52)Al-Aleem and Al-Hakeem:In this next example, we explore the most frequently paired name with Al-Aleem which is Al-Hakeem (the Most Wise). قَدْ فَرَضَ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمْ تَحِلَّةَ أَيْمَـٰنِكُمْ ۚ وَٱللَّهُ مَوْلَىٰكُمْ ۖ وَهُوَ ٱلْعَلِيمُ ٱلْحَكِيمُQad faradal laahu lakum tahillata aymaanikum; wallaahu mawlaakum wa huwal aleemul hakeemEnglish Translation:""Allah has already ordained for you [Muslims] the dissolution of your oaths. And Allah is your protector, and He is the Knowing, the Wise."" — (Qur'an 66:2)You've likely heard this quote before stating, ""knowledge is power."" But your experience or intuition may recognize that this saying is incomplete. Simply just getting more information does not directly correlate with having power. You probably know many intellectual people, but they are still prone to making very wrong decisions. They can be led astray by emotions and desires. They may have biases causing them to be blinded or tunnel-visioned. Would you call this person wise? Probably not. The issue with the quote is that it grossly downplays the importance of applying knowledge. This is what most recognize as wisdom.It's not enough to read a book. A wise person would reflect upon what's being read and try to map all the ways it's applicable in his or her everyday life. A wise person, just like a knowledgeable one, knows what to say but, more importantly, when to say it. That makes all the difference. Similarly, Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is the All-Knowing and the All-Wise. He knows what to do, when to do them, and with whom.Two lessons from knowing the pair Al-Hakeem and Al-Aleem:1. Understanding how Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is both knowing and wise can bring peace into the believer's life. We put complete trust in Allah's plan for us and what He's decreed, as we know He makes no mistakes. When calamity strikes, if we don't get that job, if we lose something we treasure - we trust that Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ knows best. There is no point in dwelling and feeling sorry for past hardships. Often the greatest pain we experience becomes our biggest strength with time and understanding. Even if we can't see the wisdom in it in this life, we must realize the benefit must lie on the day of judgment. This is the mercy of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.2. We should ask Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ to give us wisdom. People often give too much weight trying to find the ""secret."" The one thing that'll transform their life for the better. It doesn't exist, and the people purchasing the courses, books, or instructors that make these promises are taken advantage of. This is not meant to discourage seeking knowledgeable instructors or keep one from purchasing books or courses. But really it's in Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ what we should be seeking. If we don't have the intelligence or wisdom to apply our knowledge, to have the courage to take bold action when needed or to be resourceful, then it would all be for nothing.Reflection:As a person grows older, he begins to learn about different subjects and thinks of himself as knowledgeable. But if we stop to think of the vastness of Allah's knowledge, we realize we know nothing. It's a humbling experience to really ponder and ask ourselves how much we think we know. Realize and embrace the truth that we know nothing in the grand scheme of things. Letting any amount of superiority sink its way into your mind will just impede the way to further growth. A child learns the most because they are naturally curious. Everything is new and an exciting adventure. They are open, innocent and genuinely want to understand how everything works. This spurs a parent's favorite game with a child called a hundred thousand why's (sarcasm). But if you assume you already know, then the journey stops. Why explore something further if you feel you already know the outcome?Knowledge is given by Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰAllah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ tells us in Surah Baqarah, ""And [mention, O Muhammad], when your Lord said to the angels, 'Indeed, I will make upon the earth a successive authority.' They said, 'Will You place upon it one who causes corruption therein and sheds blood, while we declare Your praise and sanctify You?' Allah said, 'Indeed, I know that which you do not know.' And He taught Adam the names - all of them. Then He showed them to the angels and said, 'Inform Me of the names of these, if you are truthful.'"" (Qur'an 2:30-31) The angels then responded with the following: قَالُواْ  سُبۡحَٰنَكَ  لَا  عِلۡمَ  لَنَآ  إِلَّا  مَا  عَلَّمۡتَنَآۖ  إِنَّكَ  أَنتَ  ٱلۡعَلِيمُ  ٱلۡحَكِيمُQaaloo subhaanaka laa ilma lanaaa illaa maa allamtanaaa innaka antal aleemul hakeemEnglish Translation:""They said, 'Exalted are You; we have no knowledge except what You have taught us. Indeed, it is You who is the Knowing, the Wise.'"" — (Qur'an 2:32)These verses are a testament to how all creations have their limitations set by Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ, and without His permission, they could not know anything beyond what was allowed for them. Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ tell us He, ""taught Adam the names - all of them."" What is meant by names is left up to interpretation. Ibn Abbas understood it as names of objects for everyday discourse. Other commentators believe it to be the spoken languages on earth, or the capacity to know all things, or it could refer to Allah's Divine Names. Regardless, we see the separation between Angels' knowledge, which is limited compared to human knowledge, designed to be more comprehensive. In the tafheem ul-Quran, Maududi remarks, ""It seems that the knowledge of each angel and each genre of angel is confined to its own sphere of competence. The angels appointed to administer, let us say, things relating to air have full knowledge about this subject but have no knowledge, say, about water, and so on and so forth. Man's range of knowledge, however, is comprehensive.""We don't know what we don't know - we may ask for forgiveness for things in our hearts we know we did wrong. But what about the things we are not aware of? Ask Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ to pardon all our sins, to give us a clean slate. Ask to increase our capacity to learn and to know of our shortcomings, to make us among students with great Islamic knowledge. We are blessed today to study His attributes. This is one of the most beneficial paths one can take. It will only increase a person's love for their creator and be among those who've acquired knowledge that will benefit them. Insha-Allah, this will also lead us to share this knowledge with others and help guide others toward the straight path. Narrated Zayd ibn Thabit: I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: May Allah brighten a man who hears a tradition from us, gets it by heart and passes it on to others. Many a bearer of knowledge conveys it to one who is more versed than he is; and many a bearer of knowledge is not versed in it. [1]It was narrated that Zirr bin Hubaish said: ""I went to Safwan bin Assal Al-Muradi and he said: What brought you here? I said: I am seeking knowledge. He said: I heard the Messenger of Allah say: ""There is no one who goes out of his house in order to seek knowledge, but the angels lower their wings in approval of his action.""

الْقَابِضُ,Al-Qabid,The Restricting One,"The Constrictor, The Withholder, The Restrainer.","Allah is Al-Qabid meaning whatever He wills comes to be. He is the one who enriches and makes poor. Al-Qabid decides to withhold something or to make it scarce. He is the taker of all souls at the time of death, and He stretches His hand out to the believers so that they may turn to him and repent. He is the one who constricts sustenance, our lives, and our hearts. The opposite, Al-Basit is the one who expands and widens it with His Generosity and Mercy.","From the root qaf-ba-dad (ق ب ض), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to take in the hand, clutch, lay hold of to grasp, grip, seize, hold firmly to have absolute ownership of something, barter to contract, shrink, draw together, make scanty, make scarce to contract the heart, i.e., distress, depression, lack of joy.","Arabic Root:From the root qaf-ba-dad (ق ب ض), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to take in the hand, clutch, lay hold of to grasp, grip, seize, hold firmly to have absolute ownership of something, barter to contract, shrink, draw together, make scanty, make scarce to contract the heart, i.e., distress, depression, lack of joy.Al-Qabid and Al-Basit:The names Al-Qabid and Al-Basit are often mentioned together for juxtaposition. It emphasizes how Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ can be both the constrictor (Al-Qabid) and the one who expands something (Al-Basit). This is a display of how Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ, in His infinite wisdom, gives or withhold to whomever He pleases. مَّن  ذَا  ٱلَّذِى  يُقْرِضُ  ٱللَّهَ  قَرْضًا  حَسَنًۭا  فَيُضَـٰعِفَهُۥ  لَهُۥٓ  أَضْعَافًۭا  كَثِيرَةًۭ ۚ  وَٱللَّهُ  يَقْبِضُ  وَيَبْصُۜطُ  وَإِلَيْهِ  تُرْجَعُونَMan zal lazee yuqridul laaha qardan hasanan fayudaa ‘ifahoo lahoo ad'aafan kaseerah; wallaahu yaqbidu wa yabsutu wa ilaihi turja'oonEnglish Translation:""Who is it that would loan Allah a goodly loan so He may multiply it for him many times over? And it is Allah who withholds and grants abundance, and to Him you will be returned."" — (Qur'an 2:245)Among the disputed names:Note, the name Al-Qabid, there is no explicit mention in the Qur'an. However, as an attribute or quality of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ its been described in the Qur'an and the Hadith literature.What it means for Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ to withold:Just as food is good, but being over-indulgent is unhealthy and can be destructive, leading to many complications down the road. Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ may withhold His provisions based on His superior knowledge. In the Qur'an, it says, ""And if Allah had extended [excessively] provision for His servants, they would have committed tyranny throughout the earth. But He sends [it] down in an amount which He wills. Indeed He is, of His servants, Acquainted and Seeing."" (Qur'an 42:27)It is difficult, but if we go through a period of constriction, we should find peace as Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ knows best. We can always uncover some good in the bad. We are brought down to earth, and we are humbled. By switching our narrative, we can help transform a tragedy into an opportunity. If we see this period of our life as a test, we can behave in a manner that Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ would love to see His servant respond. For example, strive harder in worship, show sabr (patience), seek to do good deeds, help others, and take care of yourself. Perhaps these tough times are necessary to create future leaders who are more resilient, grounded, empathetic, and wise. Passing the test can allow one to climb to greater heights they never could've imagined. And Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ knows best.But it's also important to note there are no limitations put upon Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. He is the master. He can constrict whatever He wills for whomever, howsoever. All of creation exists because of Him, and it's under His control. He can dispose of His dominion however He wishes. It is not up to us to judge whether a thing is good or bad. Whatever Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ wills is good since it's from Him. He's not limited in what He can do — this goes back to the attributes of power, control, and supreme authority.The divine pairing with Al-Qabid:As we discussed previously, the perfection in meaning is best understood through viewing the names in pairs as they occur. This is the consensus among scholars, especially when the Names of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ are opposite in meaning. We should try our best to recite them in a similar manner as to avoid any perceived negative connotation. These names include Al-Qabid (The Constrictor) & Al-Basit (The Extender), Al-Awwal (The Very First from Eternity) & Al-Akhir (The very Last for Eternity), and Az-Zaahir (The Perceptible) & Al-Baatin (The Imperceptible), Al-Mu'izz (The Honourer-Bestower) & Al-Mudhill (The Abaser).In Arabic qabd means to clench, to grasp, or to seize whereas bast refers to openness. Think closed hand versus open hand, to withhold and to give. Allah will say, 'Go and take out (of Hell) anyone in whose heart you find faith equal to the weight of one (gold) Dinar.' Allah will forbid the Fire to burn the faces of those sinners. They will go to them and find some of them in Hell (Fire) up to their feet, and some up to the middle of their legs. So they will take out those whom they will recognize and then they will return, and Allah will say (to them), 'Go and take out (of Hell) anyone in whose heart you find faith equal to the weight of one half Dinar.' They will take out whomever they will recognize and return, and then Allah will say, 'Go and take out (of Hell) anyone in whose heart you find faith equal to the weight of an atom (or a smallest ant), and so they will take out all those whom they will recognize."" Abu Sa'id said: If you do not believe me then read the Holy Verse: 'Surely! Allah wrongs not even of the weight of an atom (or a smallest ant) but if there is any good (done) He doubles it.' (Qur'an 4:40) The Prophet added, ""Then the prophets and Angels and the believers will intercede, and (last of all) the Almighty (Allah) will say, 'Now remains My Intercession. He will then hold a handful (the word used here قَبْضَةً - qabdatan meaning hold, grip, grab) of the Fire from which He will take out some people whose bodies have been burnt, and they will be thrown into a river at the entrance of Paradise, called the water of life. [1]In another hadith narration, Narrated Anas ibn Malik: The people said: Messenger of Allah, prices have shot up, so fix prices for us. Thereupon the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Allah is the one Who fixes prices, withholds (the word used here is الْقَابِضُ - alqabid), gives lavishly (the word used here is الْبَاسِطُ - albasit) and provides, and I hope that when I meet Allah, none of you will have any claim on me for an injustice regarding blood or property. [2]Reflection:The believer benefits from knowing Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is both Al-Qabid and Al-Basit. We can use these names in our supplication, asking Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ to expand our hearts to be reminded in remembrance of Him. We can call upon these names for rizq as they are closely related. But remember the natural laws of contraction and expansion. We should not be overtly excited for the good provision and not be deeply saddened in times of constraint. Accept both as they come and always be grateful to Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ for what remains. Whatever happens, do not rush to conclusions and say whether it is good or bad, but say it's from Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ and He knows best. ٱللَّهُ يَبۡسُطُ ٱلرِّزۡقَ لِمَن يَشَآءُ وَيَقۡدِرُۚ وَفَرِحُواْ بِٱلۡحَيَوٰةِ ٱلدُّنۡيَا وَمَا ٱلۡحَيَوٰةُ ٱلدُّنۡيَا فِي ٱلۡأٓخِرَةِ إِلَّا مَتَٰعٞAllaahu yabsutur rizqa limai yashaaa'u wa yaqdir; wa farihoo bilhayaatid dunyaa wa mal hayaatud dunya fil Aakhirati illaa mataa' (section 3)English Translation:""Allah extends provision for whom He wills and restricts [it]. And they rejoice in the worldly life, while the worldly life is not, compared to the Hereafter, except [brief] enjoyment."" — (Qur'an 13:26)In the tafsir of Maududi, this verse refutes the disbelievers of Makkah, ""They judged a man's worth by his wealth and worldly prosperity and not by his faith and righteous conduct. [...] Allah gives His provision to the people abundantly or sparingly for reasons different from those which they presumed and richness or poverty is no criterion by which to judge the worth of people. The real criterion of judging the worth of people is their beliefs and deeds."" فَإِنَّ مَعَ ٱلۡعُسۡرِ يُسۡرًاFa inna ma'al usri yusraEnglish Translation:""For indeed, with hardship [will be] ease."" — (Qur'an 94:5)References:[1] Sahih al-Bukhari 7439[2] Sahih (Al-Albani) Sunan Abi Dawud 3451"
الْبَاسِطُ,Al-Basit,The Extender,"The Enlarger, The Expansive, The Munificent","Allah is Al-Baasit, The One who amplifies all abundance. He is the one who makes the way wide open. He expands and widens the hearts and our souls and gives us sustenance in His Generosity and Mercy. He gives plentifully to whoever He wills and reaches out a helping hand to all mankind.","From the root ba-sin-ta (ب س ط), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to expand, enlarge, extend, to grant abundance, to provide amply, to spread, widen, to make spacious, or to extend a hand.","Arabic Root:From the root ba-sin-ta (ب س ط), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to expand, enlarge, extend, to grant abundance, to provide amply, to spread, widen, to make spacious, or to extend a hand.In Arabic qabd means to clench, grasp, or seize whereas bast refers to openness.

When Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ wants to give, it is free and infinite. There is no stopping nor restricting it. ۞وَلَوۡ بَسَطَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلرِّزۡقَ لِعِبَادِهِۦ لَبَغَوۡاْ فِي ٱلۡأَرۡضِ وَلَٰكِن يُنَزِّلُ بِقَدَرٖ مَّا يَشَآءُۚ إِنَّهُۥ بِعِبَادِهِۦ خَبِيرُۢ بَصِيرٞWa law basatal laahur rizqa li'ibaadihee labaghaw fil ardi wa laakiny yunazzilu biqadarim maa yashaaa; innahoo bi'ibaadihee Khabeerun BaseerEnglish Translation:""And if Allah had extended [excessively] provision for His servants, they would have committed tyranny throughout the earth. But He sends [it] down in an amount which He wills. Indeed He is, of His servants, Acquainted and Seeing."" — (Qur'an 42:47)The divine pairing of Al-Basit:As we discussed previously, the perfection in meaning is best understood through viewing the names in pairs as they occur. This is the consensus among scholars, especially when the Names of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ are opposite in meaning. We should try our best to recite them in a similar manner as to avoid any perceived negative connotation. These names include Al-Qabid (The Constrictor) & Al-Basit (The Extender), Al-Awwal (The Very First from Eternity) & Al-Akhir (The very Last for Eternity), and Az-Zaahir (The Perceptible) & Al-Baatin (The Imperceptible), Al-Mu'izz (The Honourer-Bestower) & Al-Mudhill (The Abaser).In a hadith narration, narrated by Anas ibn Malik: The people said: Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), prices have shot up, so fix prices for us. Thereupon the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Allah is the one Who fixes prices, withholds (the word used here is الْقَابِضُ - alqabid), gives lavishly (the word used here is الْبَاسِطُ - albasit) and provides, and I hope that when I meet Allah, none of you will have any claim on me for an injustice regarding blood or property. [1]In Sahih Muslim, Abu Musa reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying that Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, Stretches out His Hand during the night so that the people may repent for the fault committed from dawn till dusk and He stretches out His Hand during the day so that the people may repent for the fault committed from dusk to dawn. (He would accept repentance) before the sun rises in the west (before the Day of Resurrection). A hadith like this has been narrated on the authority of Shu'ba with the same chain of transmitters. [2]Reflection:The believers benefits from knowing Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is both Al-Qabid and Al-Basit. We can use these names in our supplication, asking Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ to expand our hearts to be reminded in remembrance of Him. We can call upon these names for rizq as they are closely related. But remember the natural laws of contraction and expansion. We should not be overtly excited for the good provision and not be deeply saddened in times of constraint. Accept both as they come and always be grateful to Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ for what remains. Whatever happens, do not rush to conclusions and say whether it is good or bad, but say it's from Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ and He knows best. ٱللَّهُ يَبۡسُطُ ٱلرِّزۡقَ لِمَن يَشَآءُ وَيَقۡدِرُۚ وَفَرِحُواْ بِٱلۡحَيَوٰةِ ٱلدُّنۡيَا وَمَا ٱلۡحَيَوٰةُ ٱلدُّنۡيَا فِي ٱلۡأٓخِرَةِ إِلَّا مَتَٰعٞAllaahu yabsutur rizqa limai yashaaa'u wa yaqdir; wa farihoo bilhayaatid dunyaa wa mal hayaatud dunya fil Aakhirati illaa mataa (section 3)English Translation:""Allah extends provision for whom He wills and restricts [it]. And they rejoice in the worldly life, while the worldly life is not, compared to the Hereafter, except [brief] enjoyment."" — (Qur'an 13:26)In the tafsir of Maududi, this verse refutes the disbelievers of Makkah, ""They judged a man's worth by his wealth and worldly prosperity and not by his faith and righteous conduct. [...] Allah gives His provision to the people abundantly or sparingly for reasons different from those which they presumed and richness or poverty is no criterion by which to judge the worth of people. The real criterion of judging the worth of people is their beliefs and deeds.""References:[1] Sahih (Al-Albani) Sunan Abi Dawud 3451[2] Sahih Muslim 2759"
الْخَافِضُ,Al-Khafid,The Reducer,"The Lowerer, The Reducer, The Abaser","Allah is Al-Khafid (in Arabic: ٱلْخَافِضُ), meaning the Abaser, The One who lowers whoever He willed by His destruction and (Ar-Rafi) The One who raises whoever He willed by His endowment.","From the root kha-fa-dad (خ ف ض), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to lower, weaken, depress, to make humble, abase, to relax, diminish, subdue, to make gentle, tranquil, easy to deal with, to soften, make easy, facilitate.","Arabic Root:From the root kha-fa-dad (خ ف ض), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to lower, weaken, depress, to make humble, abase, to relax, diminish, subdue, to make gentle, tranquil, easy to deal with, to soften, make easy, facilitate.This attribute describes how Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ abases the proud, the oppressors, and rebels. He chooses the ones to be humbled, softened, or made gentle. He decides to raise or weaken people, to give them honor, or to take it away.Among the disputed names:Different scholars have different criteria for what qualifies as a name of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. Of the 99 names, 81 are explicitly mentioned in the Qur'an. Therefore, there is not one agreed-upon list for the remaining 18 names. Al-Khaafid is one of those names which has been excluded by some scholars. This includes Ibn Uthaymeen, Ibn Hazm, and Ibn Hajar, among others. However, Al-Khafid is commonly recognized as an official name in most books of Asmaul Husna. خَافِضَةٌۭ رَّافِعَةٌKhafidatur raafi'ahEnglish Translation:""It will bring down [some] and raise up [others]."" — (Qur'an 56:3)The downfall of Firaun:A well-known example of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ debasing someone is Firaun, the tyrannical dictator in the story of Musa (as). What was his fate despite having immense power and being the Pharaoh of Egypt? As the story goes, He sought after Musa (as) to kill or imprison him, and Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ protects Musa (as) by granting him entry through the sea by parting it. ""Then We inspired to Moses, ""Strike with your staff the sea,"" and it parted, and each portion was like a great towering mountain."" (Surah Ash-Shu'ara Ayat 63) Firaun was a witness to this but still decided to pursue and capture Musa (as) and the Israelites to prevent their escape. But the Qur'an mentions, ""Then We drowned the others."" (Surah Ash-Shu'ara Ayat 66)Now, the Qur'an does not explicitly state Firaun's name but focuses on Musa's story (as) instead. Still, the best historical account of the Pharaoh during Prophet Musa (as) time is guessed to be King Ramses II. King Ramses Mummy has been preserved and is now open to the public for visitation in the Cairo Museum in Egypt. The Qur'an says about Firaun, ""So today We will save you in body that you may be to those who succeed you a sign. And indeed, many among the people, of Our signs, are heedless"" (Qur'an 10:92)Reflection:The idea of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ being the reducer can be studied indirectly through referencing other verses from the Qur'an, which emphasize the quality. This will allow us to reflect more deeply on His greatness and wisdom. لَقَدۡ خَلَقۡنَا ٱلۡإِنسَٰنَ فِيٓ أَحۡسَنِ تَقۡوِيمٖ ثُمَّ رَدَدۡنَٰهُ أَسۡفَلَ سَٰفِلِينَ إِلَّا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّـٰلِحَٰتِ فَلَهُمۡ أَجۡرٌ غَيۡرُ مَمۡنُونٖLaqad khalaqnal insaana fee ahsani taqweem Thumma ra dad naahu asfala saafileen Ill-lal lazeena aamanoo wa amilus saalihaati; falahum ajrun ghairu mamnoonEnglish Translation:""We have certainly created man in the best of stature; Then We return him to the lowest of the low, Except for those who believe and do righteous deeds, for they will have a reward uninterrupted."" — (Quran 95:4-6) فَأَمَّا ٱلۡإِنسَٰنُ إِذَا مَا ٱبۡتَلَىٰهُ رَبُّهُۥ فَأَكۡرَمَهُۥ وَنَعَّمَهُۥ فَيَقُولُ رَبِّيٓ أَكۡرَمَنِ وَأَمَّآ إِذَا مَا ٱبۡتَلَىٰهُ فَقَدَرَ عَلَيۡهِ رِزۡقَهُۥ فَيَقُولُ رَبِّيٓ أَهَٰنَنِFa ammal insaanu izaa mab talaahu Rabbuhoo fa akramahoo wa na 'amahoo fa yaqoolu Rabbeee akraman Wa ammaaa izaa mabtalaahu faqadara 'alaihi rizqahoo fa yaqoolu Rabbeee ahaananEnglish Translation:And as for man, when his Lord tries him and [thus] is generous to him and favors him, he says, 'My Lord has honored me.' But when He tries him and restricts his provision, he says, 'My Lord has humiliated me.' — (Quran 89:15-16)The Tafheem ul-Qur'an by Abul-Maududi explores an interesting perspective on the last ayah. If the believer's reaction when his or her financial situation worsens is, ""My Lord has humiliated me,"" reveals a hidden message or wrongful thinking the person may have been blinded to. In this case, the person may be afraid to be seen as a failure. Their ego was preoccupied with attaining worldly success (which is not inherently problematic), but they may have identified with it too deeply. They fail to realize that having wealth is not a sign of Allah's approval and that a lack is not a sign of His displeasure. Rather both are tests for the believer. In wealth, the test is whether or not the person will forget his Lord or become arrogant and ingrateful. Or, as we've mentioned previously, in a position of power, will they become abusive, corrupt, and try to take advantage of people for personal gain?In poverty, the test is different. It may be a test of patience, to find satisfaction or contentment in scarcity, or whether the person can remain grateful to Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ for that which they still have. Or will his faith decrease, and his displeasure with Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ increase? Will they transgress Allah's commandments and become immoral to change their current circumstance?We've mentioned this hadith in one of the other names of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ, but it is worth reiterating here for this name. It was narrated from Salamah bin Ubaidullah bin Mihsan Al-Ansari that his father said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'Whoever among you wakes up physically healthy, feeling safe and secure within himself with food for the day, it is as if he acquired the whole world.' [1] We need to remind ourselves that sometimes this is enough; anything else Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ gives us is a gift.References:[1] Hasan (Darussalam) Sunan Ibn Majah 4141"
الرَّافِعُ,Ar-Rafi,The Exalter,"The Exalter, The Elevator, The Raiser.",Allah is Ar-Rafi (in Arabic: ٱلْرَّافِعُ). He is The One who lowers whoever He wills and raises whoever He wills. The One who chooses who will be raised in rank in every way.,"From the root ra-fa-ayn (ر ف ع), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to raise or elevate something, to uplift, to take it up, to make high, to exalt, make honorable, make eminent, to bring a thing near.","Arabic Root:From the root ra-fa-ayn (ر ف ع), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to raise or elevate something, to uplift, to take it up, to make high, to exalt, make honorable, make eminent, to bring a thing near.This name is contrasted with Al-Khafid, meaning The Reducer. Just as Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ can lower, He has the power and ability to raise. He honors certain individuals like the Prophets (may peace be upon them), who are still revered to this day. Others have been disgraced, like Abu Lahab, the uncle of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ who has an entire Surah debasing Him (i.e., Surah al-Masad).Among the disputed names:Different scholars have different criteria for what qualifies as a name of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. Of the 99 names, 81 are explicitly mentioned in the Qur'an. Therefore, there is not one agreed-upon list for the remaining 18 names. Ar-Rafi is one of those names which has been excluded by some scholars. This includes Ibn Uthaymeen, Ibn Hazm, and Ibn Hajar, among others. However, Ar-Rafi is commonly recognized as an official name in most books of Asmaul Husna. وَتِلْكَ حُجَّتُنَآ ءَاتَيْنَـٰهَآ إِبْرَٰهِيمَ عَلَىٰ قَوْمِهِۦ ۚ نَرْفَعُ دَرَجَـٰتٍۢ مَّن نَّشَآءُ ۗ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ حَكِيمٌ عَلِيمٌۭWa tilka hujjatunaaa aatainaahaaa Ibraaheema ‘alaa qawmih; narfa'u darajaatim man nashaaa'; inna Rabbaka Hakeemun ‘AleemEnglish Translation:""And that was Our [conclusive] argument which We gave Abraham against his people.

It is yet another example of how if Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ chooses, He can either exalt or debase. The popular belief among scholars is that Iblees was not an Angel but among the Jinns. But he was a high-ranking and pious one devoted to Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ.The reasoning for him being among the Jinn is that ""..angels stern (and) severe, who flinch not (from executing) the Commands they receive from Allah, but do (precisely) what they are commanded."" (Qur'an 66:6). Angels have no free will and carry out the commandments of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ, there is no disobedience. We're also told by Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) that  The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, ""Angels were created from light, jinns were created from a smokeless flame of fire, and 'Adam was created from that which you have been told (i.e., sounding clay like the clay of pottery)."" [1]The confusion as to whether Iblees was an Angel comes from this verse, ""And [mention] when We said to the angels, 'Prostrate before Adam'; so they prostrated, except for Iblees. He refused and was arrogant and became of the disbelievers."" (Qur'an 2:34) The exclusion 'except Iblees' seems to imply He was among the Angels. Al-Qurtubi said in his tafsir of Surah Baqarah: ""The idea that he was one of the angels is the view of the majority [i.e., of the early sahaba], Ibn Abbas, Ibn Mas'ud, Ibn Jurayj, Ibn al-Musayyib, Qutadah and others."" But in Surah Kahf, it is made clear, ""And [mention] when We said to the angels, 'Prostrate to Adam,' and they prostrated, except for Iblees. He was of the jinn and departed from the command of his Lord."" (Qur'an 18:50) Still the view among some is he was an Angel and then became of the Jinn upon his refusal. He was given the privilege to be the only one among the Angels when Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ revealed to them His latest creation in Adam (as). But in Surah Sad, when Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ asked why he refused to prostrate to Adam, ""He said, 'I am better than him. You created me from fire and created him from clay.'"" (Qur'an 38:76).From these verses and the hadith, it seems clear the popular opinion should be that Iblees was a high-ranking Jinn who became debased. ""[Allah] said, 'Get out of here; surely you are rajim accursed, And indeed, upon you is My curse until the Day of Recompense.'"" (Qur'an 38:77-78)Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ raised the rank of Muhammad ﷺ: In Surah Ash-Sharh verse 4, Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ reminds Prophet Muhammad ﷺ He had raised his status to comfort him. Remember that this was an early Meccan surah when the Prophet was relatively unknown, with a few followers. وَرَفَعْنَا لَكَ ذِكْرَكَWa raf ana laka zikrakEnglish Translation:""And raised high for you your repute."" — (Qur'an 95:4)Reflection:The believer benefits from the knowledge of this name. It re-affirms the reality that Ar-Rafi is the one we should rely upon. Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is high above all, so whatever it is you wish to be increased in, call upon this name. Only Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ can increase your ranks; there is no other.Be detached from your wrong-doings. Your wrong-doings are not you. Similarly, avoid the goal seeking to be raised because it creates a trap for yourself. What happens if you don't feel your status being elevated? Do you lose hope and motivation and stop seeking it from Allah? Imam Zarruq writes, ""Whosoever comes to understand that He is Al-Khafid Ar-Rafi does not place his trust in any of his states, and he settles with no reliance on any component of his knowledge or any action of his. Besides, he desires neither a lowering nor an uplifting, since the two of them are not gained saved through Him."" The one who worships Allah because they understand only He is worthy of worship, regardless of their emotional state or in success or poverty.Imam al-Ghazali writes regarding his counsel for this name, ""Man's share in this consists in exalting the truth and abasing falsehood, by supporting those who are right and reporaching those who are wrong, treating God's enemies as enemies in order to abase them and befriending God's friends in order to exalt them.""References:[1] Sahih Muslim 2996 & Riyad as-Salihin 1846"
الْمُعِزُّ,Al-Muʿizz,The Honourer-Bestower,"The Giver of Honor, The Bestower of Might.","Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Mu'izz, He gives esteem to whoever He willed; hence there will be no one to degrade them. He degrades whoever He willed; hence there is no one else to provide them with esteem. Al-Mu'izz is the one to give strength and honor to His obedient and loving servants. He gives material power to whoever He wills. He strengthens, glorifies, and makes it possible for someone or something to be respected.","From the root ayn-zay-zay (ع ز ز), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be mighty, potent, strong, powerful, high, elevated, noble, exalted, honorable, to be noble, glorious, illustrious, indomitable, invincible, respected, cherished, dear to, scarce, rare, precious, and/or unattainable.","Arabic Root:From the root ayn-zay-zay (ع ز ز), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be mighty, potent, strong, powerful, high, elevated, noble, exalted, honorable, to be noble, glorious, illustrious, indomitable, invincible, respected, cherished, dear to, scarce, rare, precious, and/or unattainable.The following two names in the series (i.e., Al-Mu'izz and Al-Mudhill) are closely related to the previous names. The emphasis of these attributes is on giving dominion or sovereignty to the people and/or taking it away. Imam al-Ghazali writes on Al-Mu'izz, ""true dominion consists in deliverance [meaning set free] from the shame of need, the dominance of passion, and the disgrace of ignorance.""Among the disputed names:We've also covered how varying scholars have different criteria for what consitutes as a name of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. Al-Mu'izz is not fully recognized as an official name by certain scholars such as Ibn Uthaymeen, Ibn Hazm, and Ibn al-Wazir among others. As a rule of thumb, if the name contains prefix alif lam before the name then that's a clear indication of belonging as a name of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ.The name Al-Mu'izz does not appear in the Qur'an, but many verses allude to this attribute as the one who gives izzah meaning strength, power, or dignity. This has been mentioned in the name of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ Al-Aziz which shares the same root. قُلِ ٱللَّهُمَّ مَٰلِكَ ٱلۡمُلۡكِ تُؤۡتِي ٱلۡمُلۡكَ مَن تَشَآءُ وَتَنزِعُ ٱلۡمُلۡكَ مِمَّن تَشَآءُ وَتُعِزُّ مَن تَشَآءُ وَتُذِلُّ مَن تَشَآءُۖ بِيَدِكَ ٱلۡخَيۡرُۖ إِنَّكَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيۡءٖ قَدِيرٞQulil laahumma Maalikal Mulki tu'til mulka man tashaaa'u wa tanzi'ul mulka mimman tashhaaa'u wa tu'izzu man tashaaa'u wa tuzillu man tashaaa'u biyadikal khairu innaka ‘alaa kulli shai'in QadeerEnglish Translation:""Say, “O Allah, Owner of Sovereignty, You give sovereignty to whom You will and You take sovereignty away from whom You will.

Thus did We plan for Joseph. He could not have taken his brother within the religion of the king except that Allah willed.

Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you. Indeed, Allah is Knowing and Acquainted."" This famous verse addresses racial discrimination and prejudice. We are all created from male and female (understood to mean our origin is the same as Adam and Eve). Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ has created us to meet other tribes so that we may get to know one another. To gain knowledge and to further understand the human condition. Despite the visible differences, we bleed the same. In the commentary of Tafhim ul-Quran, ""O people, be aware: your God is One. No Arab has any superiority over a non-Arab, and no non-Arab any superiority over an Arab, and no white one has any superiority over a black one, and no black one any superiority over a white one, except on the basis of taqwa (piety)."" With this in mind, one can characterize themselves by this name of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ by using their strength and might to what has been commanded and to uphold/honor it. The opposite for Al-Mudhill is also true. To lower and debase that which Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ has forbiden. مَن كَانَ يُرِيدُ ٱلۡعِزَّةَ فَلِلَّهِ ٱلۡعِزَّةُ جَمِيعًاۚ إِلَيۡهِ يَصۡعَدُ ٱلۡكَلِمُ ٱلطَّيِّبُ وَٱلۡعَمَلُ ٱلصَّـٰلِحُ يَرۡفَعُهُۥۚ وَٱلَّذِينَ يَمۡكُرُونَ ٱلسَّيِّـَٔاتِ لَهُمۡ عَذَابٞ شَدِيدٞۖ وَمَكۡرُ أُوْلَـٰٓئِكَ هُوَ يَبُورُMan kaana yureedul izzata falillaahil izzatu jamee'aa; ilaihi yas'adul kalimut taiyibu wal'amalus saalihu yarfa'uh; wallazeena yamkuroonas sayyiaati lahum 'azaabun shadeed; wa makru ulaaa'ika huwa yaboorEnglish Translation:""Whoever desires honor [through power] - then to Allah belongs all honor.

ٱلْمُذِلُّ,Al-Muzill/Al-Mudhill,The Dishonourer,"The Humiliator, The Disgracer, The Degrader","Allah is Al Muzil or Mudhill (in Arabic: ٱلْمُذِلُّ), He gives esteem to whoever He willed; hence there will be no one to degrade them. He degrades whoever He willed; hence there is no one else to provide them with esteem. Once a man is disgraced, He may never be honored without the permission of Allah.","From the root dad-lam-lam (ض ل ل), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be low, base, abject, paltry, to be vile, contemptible, despicable, to be inglorious, abased, humble, to be lowly, submissive, weak, to be tractable, easy, and manageable.","Arabic Root:From the root dad-lam-lam (ض ل ل), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be low, base, abject, paltry, to be vile, contemptible, despicable, to be inglorious, abased, humble, to be lowly, submissive, weak, to be tractable, easy, and manageable.The following two names in the series (i.e., Al-Mu'izz and Al-Mudhill) are closely related to the previous names. The emphasis of these attributes is on giving dominion or sovereignty to the people and/or taking it away. Imam al-Ghazali writes on Al-Mu'izz, ""true dominion consists in deliverance [meaning set free] from the shame of need, the dominance of passion, and the disgrace of ignorance.""Among the disputed names:There is no ayah which explicitly mentions the name Al-Mudhill in the Qur'an, but many describe this attribute of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. قُلِ ٱللَّهُمَّ مَـٰلِكَ ٱلْمُلْكِ تُؤْتِى ٱلْمُلْكَ مَن تَشَآءُ وَتَنزِعُ ٱلْمُلْكَ مِمَّن تَشَآءُ وَتُعِزُّ مَن تَشَآءُ وَتُذِلُّ مَن تَشَآءُ ۖ بِيَدِكَ ٱلْخَيْرُ ۖ إِنَّكَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍۢ قَدِيرٌۭQulil laahumma Maalikal Mulki tu'til mulka man tashaaa'u wa tanzi'ul mulka mimman tashhaaa'u wa tu'izzu man tashaaa'u wa tuzillu man tashaaa'u biyadikal khairu innaka ‘alaa kulli shai'in QadeerEnglish Translation:""Say, 'O Allah, Owner of Sovereignty, You give sovereignty to whom You will and You take sovereignty away from whom You will.

But the punishment of the Hereafter is greater, if they only knew."" — (Qur'an 39:26)As we mentioned in the name Al-Khafid, Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ humbles who He chooses. In the names leading up to this one, we've briefly covered the stories of Abu Lahab, Iblees, and Firaun and how they were debased. The next verse reminds us that on the day of judgement the hypocrites will also be among those who are humbled. يُنَادُونَهُمۡ أَلَمۡ نَكُن مَّعَكُمۡۖ قَالُواْ بَلَىٰ وَلَٰكِنَّكُمۡ فَتَنتُمۡ أَنفُسَكُمۡ وَتَرَبَّصۡتُمۡ وَٱرۡتَبۡتُمۡ وَغَرَّتۡكُمُ ٱلۡأَمَانِيُّ حَتَّىٰ جَآءَ أَمۡرُ ٱللَّهِ وَغَرَّكُم بِٱللَّهِ ٱلۡغَرُورُ فَٱلۡيَوۡمَ لَا يُؤۡخَذُ مِنكُمۡ فِدۡيَةٞ وَلَا مِنَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْۚ مَأۡوَىٰكُمُ ٱلنَّارُۖ هِيَ مَوۡلَىٰكُمۡۖ وَبِئۡسَ ٱلۡمَصِيرُYunaadoonahum alam nakum ma'akum qaaloo balaa wa laakinnakum fatantum anfusakum wa tarabbastum wartabtum wa gharratkumul amaaniyyu hatta jaaa'a amrul laahi wa gharrakum billaahil gharoor Fal Yawma laa yu'khazu minkum fidyatunw wa laa minal lazeena kafaroo; ma'waakumun Naaru hiya maw laakum wa bi'sal maseerEnglish Translation:""The hypocrites will call to the believers, “Were we not with you?” They will say, “Yes, but you afflicted yourselves and awaited [misfortune for us] and doubted, and wishful thinking deluded you until there came the command of Allah. And the Deceiver deceived you concerning Allah. So today no ransom will be taken from you or from those who disbelieved. Your refuge is the Fire. It is most worthy of you, and wretched is the destination."" — (Qur'an 57:14-15)Reflection:As mentioned in Al-Mu'izz - To be among the honored Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ tells in Surah Hujurat verse 76, ""O mankind, indeed We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another. Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you. Indeed, Allah is Knowing and Acquainted."" This famous verse addresses racial discrimination and prejudice. We are all created from male and female (understood to mean our origin is the same as Adam and Eve). Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ has created us to meet other tribes so that we may get to know one another. To gain knowledge and to further understand the human condition. Despite the visible differences, we bleed the same. In the commentary of Tafhim ul-Quran, ""O people, be aware: your God is One. No Arab has any superiority over a non-Arab, and no non-Arab any superiority over an Arab, and no white one has any superiority over a black one, and no black one any superiority over a white one, except on the basis of taqwa (piety)."" With this in mind, one can characterize themselves by this name of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ by using their strength and might to what has been commanded and to uphold/honor it. The opposite for Al-Mudhill is also true. To lower and debase that which Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ has forbiden."
السَّمِيعُ,As-Sami,The All-Hearing,"The Hearer. His eternal hearing without an ear, instrument or organ.","Allah is As-Sami (in Arabic: ٱلْسَّمِيعُ) the perpetual hearer. He pays attention to every supplication, listening to all who reach out to Him. Whether we speak loudly or in secrecy, English or in French, Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ hears it all.","From the root sin-mim-ayn (س م ع), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to hear, to listen, to accept, to receive, to be told, to pay attention to, pay regard, to understand the meaning.","Arabic Root:From the root sin-mim-ayn (س م ع), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to hear, to listen, to accept, to receive, to be told, to pay attention to, pay regard, to understand the meaning.The name of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ As-Sami is established in the Qur'an. Thus far, we've discussed attributes about His will, power, knowledge, strength, and ability. Next, we focus on Allah's attributes of hearing and seeing. But note this is not to anthropomorphize Allah's qualities. Rather, we affirm these attributes because He affirmed them. His seeing is not like our seeing. His hearing is far greater than our hearing. Imam Al-Ghazali wrote, ""He hears without any auditory organs or ears, as He acts without limbs and speaks without a tongue; and His hearing is free from accidents which could befall it."" قُلْ إِن ضَلَلْتُ فَإِنَّمَآ أَضِلُّ عَلَىٰ نَفْسِى ۖ وَإِنِ ٱهْتَدَيْتُ فَبِمَا يُوحِىٓ إِلَىَّ رَبِّىٓ ۚ إِنَّهُۥ سَمِيعٌۭ قَرِيبٌۭQul in dalaltu fainnamaaa adillu ‘alaa nafsee wa inih-tadaitu fabimaa yoohee ilaiya Rabbee; innahoo Samee'un QareebEnglish Translation:""Say, 'If I should err, I would only err against myself. But if I am guided, it is by what my Lord reveals to me. Indeed, He is Hearing and near.'"" — (Qur'an 34:50)What does it mean for Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ to hear?So how do we then conceptualize Allah's hearing? From this ayah, we learn Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is near to all of us, and He is forever listening. There is no deficiency in His perception. He hears all, even if it were hidden. He knows what is felt by the heart. So, whatever it is you want, make du'a and ask of it from Allah the Almighty. There is no limit and nothing He can't fulfill. This attribute is also a reminder if you need someone to talk to, He will always be there to hear from His servant. We don't have to go to His house (Kaabah) just to be close to Him. ""And when My servants ask you, [O Muhammad], concerning Me - indeed I am near. I respond to the invocation of the supplicant when he calls upon Me"" (Qur'an 2:186)Human desire to be heard:All humans, on some level, crave to be loved and heard. And sometimes, the people closest to us can hurt us the most because we expect them to reciprocate interest, and when they don't, it feels like a betrayal. We've taken time to listen to them, but they turn around and prioritize their own lives, issues, and problems. It can feel isolating. We should recognize a good friend is someone who will listen not just when we've got good news but when we're down. In the Qur'an, Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ reassures us many times that He is the eternal hearer. The best friend/listener you could ask for. We can always fall back and know He is listening and available for us. Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ also makes this point heard by repeating this name for a total of 45 throughout the Qur'an. قَدْ سَمِعَ ٱللَّهُ قَوْلَ ٱلَّتِى تُجَـٰدِلُكَ فِى زَوْجِهَا وَتَشْتَكِىٓ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ وَٱللَّهُ يَسْمَعُ تَحَاوُرَكُمَآ ۚ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ سَمِيعٌۢ بَصِيرٌQad sami'al laahu qawlal latee tujaadiluka fee zawjihaa wa tashtakeee ilal laahi wallaahu yasma'u tahaawurakumaa; innal laaha samee'um baseerEnglish Translation:""Certainly has Allah heard the speech of the one who argues with you, [O Muhammad], concerning her husband and directs her complaint to Allah. And Allah hears your dialogue; indeed, Allah is Hearing and Seeing."" — (Qur'an 58:1)This ayah also shows a second meaning to the name Sami which is 'hearing the speech' or acceptance. For example, when a person praying comes up from ruku they say, سَمِعَ اللَّهُ لِمَنْ حَمِدَهُ Sami Allahu liman hamidah, meaning 'Allah hears the one who praises Him.' [1]From the Story of Prophet Yaqub (as):At some low point in our lives, we may have questioned whether Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ has heard our prayers. In a moment of weakness, the shaitan whispers in our ears, tricking us into thinking our supplication went ""unheard."" This is faulty thinking. Just because we immediately didn't get what we wanted doesn't mean He hasn't heard our prayer. Remember that even Prophet Yaqub (as) spent many years separated from his son Yusuf (as). He grieved as any father would. The Qur'an states Yaqub's (as) vision became impaired from stress, sorrow, and frequent sobbing. But Yaqub (as) never wavered in Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ plan for him. He kept turning to Him, praying, making du'a, asking that he be reunited with his son. He would say, ""I only complain of my suffering and my grief to Allah…"" (Qur'an 12:86) and ""And Allah has full power and control over His Affairs, but most of men know not."" (Qur'an 12:21) Eventually, His du'a went from being heard to accepted and he was reunited with his son.The other subtlety that's often missed, which encompasses the name Al-Sami, is Allah's acceptance and/or His response. As Yaqub (as) mentioned, ""Allah has full power and control over His affairs."" This is why Prophet Ibrahim and Ishamel (may peace be upon them) asked Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ to accept their du'a as He is Samme'ul Aleem. He hears and knows what's best for the believer. وَإِذۡ  يَرۡفَعُ  إِبۡرَٰهِـۧمُ  ٱلۡقَوَاعِدَ  مِنَ  ٱلۡبَيۡتِ  وَإِسۡمَٰعِيلُ  رَبَّنَا  تَقَبَّلۡ  مِنَّآۖ  إِنَّكَ  أَنتَ  ٱلسَّمِيعُ  ٱلۡعَلِيمُWa iz yarfa'u Ibraaheemul qawaa'ida minal Baitiwa Ismaa'eelu Rabbanaa taqabbal minnaa innaka Antas Samee'ul AleemEnglish Translation:""And [mention] when Abraham was raising the foundations of the House and [with him] Ishmael, [saying], “Our Lord, accept [this] from us. Indeed You are the Hearing, the Knowing."" — (Qur'an 2:127)Reflection:Learning about As-Sami is a reminder to ourselves to become better listeners. Just as Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ tells us He listens, can we say the same? How closely have we heard and understood the calling of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ? Could we do better in following what was shown to us for guidance? Go out and seek to hear things that will benefit the mind, body, and soul. Listen and learn from the Qur'an, and seek knowledge that benefits your life, career, marriage, children, and your deen. Set aside a portion of your day, be it 10-20 minutes, to search for these things.From this, we also understand the importance of being watchful over our words and our actions. If in every moment we realized Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ was watching over us, then we would speak and act in the highest manner. We would be diligent to avoid all that which displeases Him.Furthermore, it makes us reflect on the importance that good communication plays in our lives. How would you assess or grade your listening skills? It truly is an art form to be mastered. A mother who is upset with her son may not really be upset about the subject matter. If it's a common occurrence, it may be seeking attention in the only way she knows the son will respond. Good communication is picking up on or asking ourselves if we're missing something other than what's being said. This goes back to human desire to be heard and understood.In the hadith narrated by Abu Musa: We were with the Prophet (ﷺ) on a journey, and whenever we ascended a high place, we used to say, ""Allahu Akbar."" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""Don't trouble yourselves too much! You are not calling a deaf or an absent person, but you are calling One Who Hears, Sees, and is very near."" [2]Find comfort in knowing we are never truly alone, ""you are calling One Who Hears, Sees, and is very near."" The world may misunderstand you, but Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ knows the purity and kindness that lives in your heart. He understands what's really being said and what we need.References:[1] Sahih (Darussalam) Sunan an-Nasa'i 1062[2] Sahih al-Bukhari 7386"
الْبَصِيرُ,Al-Basir,The All-Seeing,The All-Noticing. The one who sees all things by His Eternal Seeing without a pupil or any other instrument.,"Allah is Al-Baseer (in Arabic: ٱلْبَصِيرُ), He sees everything, even if it's insignificant, like a black ant on a black stone when it's pitch black at night. There is nothing hidden from His sight. He has knowledge of all things, both in Heaven and on Earth. He does not miss any detail. His sight encompasses all, not just the superficial. He sees what's truly within.","From the root ba-sad-ra (ب ص ر), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to see, behold, to notice, to understand, to know, to perceive, to have insight, to be acutely aware.","Arabic Root:From the root ba-sad-ra (ب ص ر), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to see, behold, to notice, to understand, to know, to perceive, to have insight, to be acutely aware.Al-Basir is the complementary name to As-Sami, which means ""The All Hearing."" These names are often used in tandem to emphasize how Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ has complete awareness and is knowledgeable of everything. The idea that nothing escapes Him. This name makes an appearance a total of 42 times throughout the Qur'an.From the story of Prophet Musa (as): قَالَ لَا تَخَافَآ ۖ إِنَّنِى مَعَكُمَآ أَسْمَعُ وَأَرَىٰQaala laa takhaafaaa innanee ma'akumaa asma'u wa araaEnglish Translation:""[Allah] said, “Fear not. Indeed, I am with you both; I hear and I see."" — (Qur'an 20:46)This verse was said to Prophet Musa (as) when he was commanded to confront the tyrannical Firaun. Imagine being in Prophet Musa (as) shoes. You know Firaun's violent history of torturing and enslaving anyone who defied him. Now, imagine Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ telling you He is by your side. That He is hearing and seeing does not ease Musa (as) task at hand, but it does highlight another meaning to the name Al-Basir, which often gets overlooked. It's a reminder that Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is not just watching you, but He is watching over you. It's a name that, once understood, should instill peace, comfort, and protection. وَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى ٱلْعَزِيزِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ ٱلَّذِى يَرَىٰكَ حِينَ تَقُومُ وَتَقَلُّبَكَ فِى ٱلسَّـٰجِدِينَ  إِنَّهُۥ  هُوَ ٱلسَّمِيعُ ٱلْعَلِيمُWa tawakkal alal ‘Azeezir Raheem Allazee yaraaka heena taqoom Wa taqallubaka fis saajideen Innahoo Huwas Samee'ul ‘AleemEnglish Translation:""And rely upon the Exalted in Might, the Merciful, Who sees you when you arise And your movement among those who prostrate.

And Allah is Seeing of [His] servants -"" — (Qur'an 3:15)Reflection:We must remember that Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is The All-Hearer and The All-Seer. If we kept this at the forefront of our minds, it would save us from a lot of trouble. Knowing Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is watching, we would avoid doing or saying something we would later regret. It serves as a preventive mechanism through which we can filter our choices, raising awareness of our speech and actions.Furthermore, the believer who knows Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Basir finds comfort. Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ notices every detail, public or in private. Sometimes we may not get credited for our work, or our kindness and generosity may get taken advantage of or go unappreciated. But the believer can find solace in understanding that Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ sees and knows all. Nothing goes without His noticing, and on the day of judgment, all accounts will be measured accurately. If instead of seeking validation through others, we realized that any good would be rewarded in a multiple by Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ and His approval is all that matters, we should be overjoyed. Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ says in the Qur'an, ""And what is the reward of goodness, but goodness."" (Quran 55:60) Continue to do good because it will come back around. Do things for Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ sake and you will never be disappointed. وَقُلِ ٱعۡمَلُواْ فَسَيَرَى ٱللَّهُ عَمَلَكُمۡ وَرَسُولُهُۥ وَٱلۡمُؤۡمِنُونَۖ وَسَتُرَدُّونَ إِلَىٰ عَٰلِمِ ٱلۡغَيۡبِ وَٱلشَّهَٰدَةِ فَيُنَبِّئُكُم بِمَا كُنتُمۡ تَعۡمَلُونَ,Wa qul i'maloo fasayaral laahu ‘amalakum wa Rasooluhoo wal mu'minoon; wa saturaddoona ilaa ‘Aalimil Ghaibi washshahaadati fa yunabbi'ukum bimaa kuntum ta'maloonEnglish Translation:""And say, 'Do [as you will], for Allah will see your deeds, and [so, will] His Messenger and the believers.

الْحَكَمُ,Al-Hakam,The Impartial Judge,"The Arbitrator, The Judge, The Giver of Justice.","Allah is Al-Hakam (in Arabic: ٱلْحَكَمُ), The Giver of Justice. His judgment, once rendered, cannot be thwarted. He always delivers justly in every situation and never makes a mistake. He is the best of judges.","From the root ha-kaf-mim (ح ك م), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be wise, knowing the true nature of things, to pass judgment, to decide, pass a verdict, to judge and pass sentence, to prevent or restrain from wrongdoing or corruption, to turn someone back from wrongdoing or ignorance.","Arabic Root:From the root ha-kaf-mim (ح ك م), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be wise, knowing the true nature of things, to pass judgment, to decide, pass a verdict, to judge and pass sentence, to prevent or restrain from wrongdoing or corruption, to turn someone back from wrongdoing or ignorance.Al-Hakam is the judge, the arbitrator, and the giver of justice. Similar to Al-Hakeem (The All-Wise), which comes from the same root. To be the best of judges, you must be all-wise. You may hear the term Hikmah, a concept from Islamic philosophy that concerns wisdom, rationality, and objectivity, i.e., knowing the essence of things as they are. A person with hikmah has complete clarity. They see the action and the consequences thereafter.Imam al-Ghazali writes, He ""is the arbitrating magistrateand the avenging judge, whose ruling no-one overturns and whose decree no-one corrects."" أَفَحُكْمَ ٱلْجَـٰهِلِيَّةِ يَبْغُونَ ۚ وَمَنْ أَحْسَنُ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ حُكْمًۭا لِّقَوْمٍۢ يُوقِنُونَAfahukmal jaahiliyyati yabghoon; wa man ahsanu minal laahi hukmal liqawminy yooqinoon (section 7)English Translation:""Then is it the judgement of [the time of] ignorance they desire?

Under the lens of Him being the most wise and the best of judges, we shouldn't worry ourselves with what has been decreed. The hadith mentions for us to ""recognize and acknowledge Allah in times of ease and prosperity, and He will remember you in times of adversity. And know that what has passed you by [and you have failed to attain] was not going to befall you, and what has befallen you was not going to pass you by. And know that victory comes with patience, relief with affliction, and hardship with ease."" [1]Our only task in this life is to take control of our hearts' state, keep it pure despite the surrounding factors, and perform to the best of our abilities. We must find and focus our attention on the things which are within our control. Everything else that happens outside is the will of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ, and He is the best arbitrator. If your focus is on things outside of your grasp, you will forever give up your happiness. Shaykh Tosun Bayrak says, ""Instead of questioning Allah's judgment, be a true judge of yourself. Neither tyranize yourself nor excuse and pamper yourself."" Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ says, ""And that there is not for man except that [good] for which he strives And that his effort is going to be seen - Then he will be recompensed for it with the fullest recompense"" (Qur'an 53:39-41)Du'a of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ:We can learn the same du'a for guidance that Prophet Muhammad ﷺ made as mentioned in the hadith which mentions Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ as the arbitrator:اللّهُـمَّ رَبَّ جِـبْرائيل - وَميكـائيل - وَإِسْـرافيل - فاطِـرَ السَّمواتِ وَالأَرْض - عالـِمَ الغَيْـبِ وَالشَّهـادَةِ أَنْـتَ تَحْـكمُ بَيْـنَ عِبـادِكَ فيـما كانوا فيهِ يَخْتَلِفـون. اهدِنـي لِمـا اخْتُـلِفَ فيـهِ مِنَ الْحَـقِّ بِإِذْنِك - إِنَّـكَ تَهْـدي مَنْ تَشـاءُ إِلى صِراطٍ مُسْتَقـيمAllahumma, rabba Jibra'ila, wa Mika'ila, wa Israfila Fatira s-samawati wa l-ardi, alima l-ghaybi wa sh-shahadati, anta tahkumu bayna ibadika fima kanu fihi yakhtalifuna. Ihdini li makhtulifa fihi min al-haqqi bi idhnika. Innaka tahdi man tasha'u ila siratin mustaqim.English Translation:""O Allah, Lord of Jibraīl, Mīkaīl and Israfīl (great angels), Creator of the heavens and the Earth, Knower of the seen and the unseen. You are the arbitrator between Your servants in that which they have disputed. Guide me to the truth by Your leave, in that which they have differed, for verily You guide whom You will to a straight path.""[2]Reflection:A believer benefits in knowing that Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Hakam. Although it can be difficult to find in your heart to forgive a perpetrator, personal retribution is not always necessary, knowing justice will be served on the day of judgment. This is not meant with any malice. Perhaps whatever the person did, he atoned sincerely, and Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ sees and knows best. But from an individual standpoint, if we understand and accept Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Hakam, it can be used as a tool to remain emotionally whole and to find forgiveness instead of seeking revenge.We share a beautiful quote by the writer Cormac McCarthy on forgiveness, ""He knew that our enemies by contrast seem always with us. The greater our hatred the more persistent the memory of them so that a truly terrible enemy becomes deathless. So that the man who has done you great injury or injustice makes himself a guest in your house forever. Perhaps only forgiveness can dislodge him."" This is similar to the idea that hate is a poison more deadly to the hater than the hated. وَٱتَّبِعْ مَا يُوحَىٰٓ إِلَيْكَ وَٱصْبِرْ حَتَّىٰ يَحْكُمَ ٱللَّهُ ۚ وَهُوَ خَيْرُ ٱلْحَـٰكِمِينَWattabi maa yoohaaa ilaika wasbir hattaa yahkumal laah; wa Huwa khairul haakimeen (section 11)English Translation:""And follow what is revealed to you, [O Muhammad], and be patient until Allah will judge. And He is the best of judges."" — (Qur'an 10:109)Another takeaway is we can strive to be impartial just as Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is impartial. It should increase our desire to raise our standards to be rational, objective, and righteous in our actions. To consistently make the right decision aligned with our values and deen. Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Bakrah narrated: ""My father wrote to 'Ubaidullah bin Abi Bakrah who was a judge: ""Do not pass a judgement between two people while you are angry, for indeed I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) saying: 'The judge should not judge between two people while he is angry.'""

الْعَدْلُ,Al-Adl,The Embodiment of Justice,"The Just, The One who is entitled to do what He does.","Allah is Al-Adl (in Arabic: ٱلْعَدْلُ), The one who rectifies and sets matters straight in a just and equitable manner. He always delivers absolute justice through His wisdom without failure. He gives each what he deserves and puts everything in its proper order.","From the root ayn-dal-lam (ع د ل), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to act justly, fairly, equitably, to adjust properly, to make even, to straighten, to rectify, to establish justice or balance. To make equal, uniform, to turn one away from something, rightly, direct, to make comfortable with what is right.","Arabic Root:From the root ayn-dal-lam (ع د ل), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to act justly, fairly, equitably, to adjust properly, to make even, to straighten, to rectify, to establish justice or balance. To make equal, uniform, to turn one away from something, rightly, direct, to make comfortable with what is right.Among the disputed names: We've mentioned previously how varying scholars have different criteria for what constitutes being a name of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. The name Al-Adl is not recognized as an official name by scholars such as Ibn Uthaymeen, Ibn Hazm, and Ibn al-Wazir, among others. As a rule of thumb, if the name contains the prefix alif lam before the name in the Qur'an, then that's a clear indication of belonging as a name of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. There is no verse directly quoting Al-Adl in the Qur'an.In Sahih Muslim, ""O My servants! I have forbidden dhulm (oppression) for Myself, and I have made it forbidden amongst you, so do not oppress one another.""  [1] Here Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ makes a declaration, He can do anything He pleases, but He forbids injustice for Himself. A point made to let us know that He is not unjust. Allah then commands us to uphold this standard amongst ourselves, to call out and prevent any injustice we may see. إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَا يَظْلِمُ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍۢ ۖ وَإِن تَكُ حَسَنَةًۭ يُضَـٰعِفْهَا وَيُؤْتِ مِن لَّدُنْهُ أَجْرًا عَظِيمًۭاInnal laaha laa yazlimu misqaala zarratinw wa in taku hasanatany yudaa'ifhaa wa yu'ti mil ladunhu ajran ‘azeemaaEnglish Translation: ""Indeed, Allah does not do injustice, [even] as much as an atom's weight; while if there is a good deed, He multiplies it and gives from Himself a great reward."" — (Qur'an 4:40) إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَأْمُرُ بِٱلْعَدْلِ وَٱلْإِحْسَـٰنِ وَإِيتَآئِ ذِى ٱلْقُرْبَىٰ وَيَنْهَىٰ عَنِ ٱلْفَحْشَآءِ وَٱلْمُنكَرِ وَٱلْبَغْىِ ۚ يَعِظُكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَذَكَّرُونَInnal laaha ya'muru bil ‘adli wal ihsaani wa eetaaa'i zil qurbaa wa yanhaa ‘anil fahshaaa'i wal munkari walbagh-i' ya'izukum la'allakum tazakkaroonEnglish Translation: ""Indeed, Allah orders justice and good conduct and giving to relatives and forbids immorality and bad conduct and oppression. He admonishes you that perhaps you will be reminded."" — (Qur'an 16:90) وَتَمَّتْ كَلِمَتُ رَبِّكَ صِدْقًۭا وَعَدْلًۭا ۚ لَّا مُبَدِّلَ لِكَلِمَـٰتِهِۦ ۚ وَهُوَ ٱلسَّمِيعُ ٱلْعَلِيمُWa tammat Kalimatu Rabbika sidqanw wa ‘adlaa; laa mubaddila li Kalimaatih; wa Huwas Samee'ul ‘AleemEnglish Translation:"" And the word of your Lord has been fulfilled in truth and in justice. None can alter His words, and He is the Hearing, the Knowing."" — (Qur'an 6:115)Why is there suffering? The topic of suffering can bring about doubt in a believer's heart. The uneasiness we feel is because we can't comprehend Allah's justice. We may have uncertainties, fear, or forget this world is only but a temporary residence. We must remember everything is within Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ ownership and control. He can do whatever, with whomever, and He is the All-Wise and All-Knowing. If we understand this, we don't need to go any further. Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ can dispose of all of creation today, and it wouldn't be right or wrong; it's just His command. This is what it means to be the Supreme Authority, King of Kings, and the All-Powerful. To deny this would be to deny His attributes. But only seeing Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ only through the lens of His independence and sovereignty misses His essence. It is more comprehensive seeing all His attributes working together, including Him being the All-Knower, the All-Wise, The Merciful, and The Embodiment of Justice.Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ tells mankind, ""Surely We will test you with a bit of fear and hunger, and loss in wealth and lives and fruits, and give good tidings to the patient."" ( Qur'an 2:155) And Prophet Muhammad ﷺ said,  ""No fatigue, nor disease, nor sorrow, nor sadness, nor hurt, nor distress befalls a Muslim, even if it were the prick he receives from a thorn, but that Allah expiates some of his sins for that.""  [2] So, we must remember this life is only temporary, and with ""every hardship is ease,"" whether it is realized in this life or the hereafter. This is Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ justice - it will always be fair and measured. ""Allah does not task any self beyond its capacity"" (Qur'an 2:286).On the suffering of a child:For every child that passes away, they are granted eternal bliss in Paradise. In a hadith, it reports Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) who used to ask his companions, ""Did anyone of you see a dream?"" and they told him their dream. He commented on this dream, "" And the tall man whom you saw in the garden, is Abraham and the children around him are those children who die with Al-Fitra (the Islamic Faith). Some Muslims asked the Prophet, ""O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! What about the children of pagans?"" The Prophet (ﷺ) replied, ""And also the children of pagans.""""  [3]Abu Hassan reported: I said to Abu Huraira that my two children had died. Would you narrate to me anything from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) a hadith that would soothe our hearts in our bereavements? He said: Yes. Small children are the fowls of Paradise. If one of them meets his father (or he said his parents) he would take hold of his cloth, or he said with his hand as I take hold of the hem of your cloth (with my hand). And he (the child) would not take off (his hand) from it until Allah causes his father to enter Paradise.[4]Abdullah ibn Amr reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said, ""Verily, those who were just will be in the presence of Allah upon pulpits of light, near the right hand of the Merciful, the Exalted, and both of His sides are honorable. They are those who practiced justice in their judgments and with their families and in all that they did.""

And if you distort [your testimony] or refuse [to give it], then indeed Allah is ever, with what you do, Acquainted."" — ( Qur'an 4:135)Reflection:In recognizing Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ as just, how can we bring this virtue into our life? Instead of seeking confirmation or looking to prove our side as being correct, can we instead seek the truth? This would necessitate leaving our emotions and ego at the door. We would have to embrace our weaknesses and the possibility of being wrong. We can also expand the scope of justice to go beyond interpersonal dynamics. We can look within the individual. Are we just to our souls, treating ourselves with respect, or are we oppressive to ourselves?References:[1] Sahih Muslim 2577a[2] Sahih al-Bukhari 5641[3] Sahih al-Bukhari 7047[4] Sahih Muslim 2635[5] Sahih (authentic) Sahih Muslim 4493"
اللَّطِيفُ,Al-Lateef,The Knower of Subtleties,"The Subtle One, The Gracious, The One who is kind to His servants and endows upon them.","Allah is Al-Lateef. The most gentle and gracious to people and cares for them, although they may be oblivious to his acts. His nature is kind, affectionate, and understanding of the subtle details of individual circumstances. His actions are so subtle that they can not be observable or understood. He does things for you that you will never know. This is the name of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ to call when asking for help through hardship.","From the root lam-ta-fa (ل ط ف), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be thin, delicate, refined, elegant, graceful, gentle, gracious, courteous, kindly, subtle, to know the obscurities of all affairs, to treat with regard for circumstances, to be most soothing and refined in manner, to treat with kindness, goodness, gentleness, benevolence, and affection.","Arabic Root:From the root lam-ta-fa (ل ط ف), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be thin, delicate, refined, elegant, graceful, gentle, gracious, courteous, kindly, subtle, to know the obscurities of all affairs, to treat with regard for circumstances, to be most soothing and refined in manner, to treat with kindness, goodness, gentleness, benevolence, and affection.All the names of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ are beautiful and complete. But Al-Lateef often holds a special place in a believer's heart as it resonates deeply with the human spirit. It carries with it many meanings depending on the context it is used. But generally, this name refers to the attribute of ""gentleness."" Imam al-Ghazali writes of Al-Latif as being the only one ""deserving of this name if one knows the subtleties of those things which are beneficial, as well as their hidden aspects, along with what is subtle about them and what is benevolent."" Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ knows where the most subtle and hidden benefit lies, and He knows how to use it for whomever He has destined it for. This gentleness and subtlety manifest themselves in many ways. For example, attending a khutbah, watching a random video online, or reading a book a friend recommended, al-Latif delivers a message that gives you exactly what you need to hear. It would appear like that message was directly written or spoken for you. The timing could not have been any better. Al-Ghazali continues, ""Moreover, in conveying them to those who are deserving, he is committed to the path of gentleness rather than harshness."" The knower of subtleties: Just as Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is subtle in His kindness and giving, He is aware of all nuances or things trying to remain inconspicuous. Nothing is neglected. Everything has its place and will be accounted for. يَـٰبُنَىَّ إِنَّهَآ إِن تَكُ مِثْقَالَ حَبَّةٍۢ مِّنْ خَرْدَلٍۢ فَتَكُن فِى صَخْرَةٍ أَوْ فِى ٱلسَّمَـٰوَٰتِ أَوْ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ يَأْتِ بِهَا ٱللَّهُ ۚ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَطِيفٌ خَبِيرٌۭYa bunaiya innahaaa in taku misqaala habbatim min khardalin fatakun fee sakhratin aw fis samaawaati aw fil ardi yaati bi Allah; innal laaha lateefun KhabeerEnglish Translation:"" [And Luqman said], ""O my son, indeed if wrong should be the weight of a mustard seed and should be within a rock or [anywhere] in the heavens or in the earth, Allah will bring it forth. Indeed, Allah is Subtle and Acquainted."" — (Qur'an 31:16) أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ أَنزَلَ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مَآءًۭ فَتُصْبِحُ ٱلْأَرْضُ مُخْضَرَّةً ۗ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَطِيفٌ خَبِيرٌۭAlam tara annal laaha anzala minas samaaa'i maaa'an fatusbihul ardu mukhdarrah; innal laaha Lateefun KhabeerEnglish Translation: ""Do you not see that Allah has sent down rain from the sky and the earth becomes green? Indeed, Allah is Subtle and Acquainted."" — (Qur'an 22:63)Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is the creator, subtle in design. Imam al-Ghazali writes, ""In sum, He is wise insofar as He plans things, generous insofar as He creates them, fashioner insofar as He orders them, just insofar as He puts each thing in its proper place, and benevolent insofar as He does not overlook subtleties and qualities of gentleness concerning them."" The level of sophistication, the attention to detail of the minutiae, none can be overlooked in order to understand His name.Story of Prophet Yusuf (as):The story of Prophet Yusuf, may peace be upon him, is also very instructive in getting to understand how Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Lateef: وَرَفَعَ أَبَوَيْهِ عَلَى ٱلْعَرْشِ وَخَرُّواْ لَهُۥ سُجَّدًۭا ۖ وَقَالَ يَـٰٓأَبَتِ هَـٰذَا تَأْوِيلُ رُءْيَـٰىَ مِن قَبْلُ قَدْ جَعَلَهَا رَبِّى حَقًّۭا ۖ وَقَدْ أَحْسَنَ بِىٓ إِذْ أَخْرَجَنِى مِنَ ٱلسِّجْنِ وَجَآءَ بِكُم مِّنَ ٱلْبَدْوِ مِنۢ بَعْدِ أَن نَّزَغَ ٱلشَّيْطَـٰنُ بَيْنِى وَبَيْنَ إِخْوَتِىٓ ۚ إِنَّ رَبِّى لَطِيفٌۭ لِّمَا يَشَآءُ ۚ إِنَّهُۥ هُوَ ٱلْعَلِيمُ ٱلْحَكِيمُWa raf'a abawaihi ‘alal ‘arshi wa kharroo lahoo sujjadaa; wa qaala yaaa abati haaza taaweelu ru'yaaya min qablu qad ja'alahaa Rabbee haqqaa; wa qad ahsana beee iz akhrajanee minas sijni wa jaaa'a bikum minal badwi mim ba'di an nazaghash Shaitaanu bainee wa baina ikhwatee; inna Rabbee lateeful limaa yashaaa'; innahoo Huwal Aleemul HakeemEnglish Translation:"" And he raised his parents upon the throne, and they bowed to him in prostration. And he said, ""O my father, this is the explanation of my vision of before. My Lord has made it reality. And He was certainly good to me when He took me out of prison and brought you [here] from bedouin life after Satan had induced [estrangement] between me and my brothers. Indeed, my Lord is Subtle in what He wills. Indeed, it is He who is the Knowing, the Wise."" — ( Qur'an 12:100)In the story of Yusuf (as), we know he has a vision in his dream where ""eleven stars and the sun and the moon; I saw them prostrating to me."" (Qur'an 12:4). He does not know exactly when, where, and how this will happen. But Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ had decreed this and shown him his destiny in a dream. The path was unclear and unknown to Yusuf (as). In fact, from the outside looking in, it would seem like a delusional vision as nothing seemed to go right for Yusuf (as). In his home, his older brothers were envious of Yusuf (as) and plotted to kill him, but before this plan was put into action, someone spoke up and said, ""Do not kill Joseph [Yusuf] but throw him into the bottom of the well"" (Qur'an 12:10)Once abandoned in a well, a caravan passing by finds him detains him, and pawns him as a slave to the highest bidder. Another stroke of 'luck' is out of all the people, Yusuf (as) was purchased by a man named Azeez - a pious, wealthy, and respectful man. Finally, Yusuf (as) could breathe and had a place to mature, but the coast was not clear. Eventually, problems between Yusuf (as) and Zulaikha (Azeez's wife) transpired. It wasn't before long this situation led to Yusuf (as) being falsely imprisoned. In jail, he developed a reputation as being the interpreter for dreams. The security guard picks up on this talent and shares this information with the King, who is troubled by a recurring dream. This access and opportunity then granted Yusuf (as) to be recognized, released, and promoted by the King. This leads to the inevitable conclusion of the story, where Yusuf sees the dream he had as a kid come true. As this verse above states, ""this is the explanation of my vision of before. My Lord has made it reality."" Reflection:From the story of Prophet Yusuf (as), we can see how Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Lateef and guides us without our knowledge. It is subtle in ways we cannot connect the dots moving forward, only looking back. Even then, we may not understand all of its intricacies. A wrong turn can lead to a disastrous outcome. Imagine the person who did not inspire the brothers to throw Yusuf (as) in the well. What if he was sold as a slave to someone other than Azeez? Would Yusuf (as) have met the King without being falsely imprisoned? We can learn from this story just how the quality of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ being Al-Lateef manifests. Perhaps there's a blessing in not being accepted into that prestigious university you wanted. Instead, you being forced to ""settle"" for a local college, you meet a professor by ""happenstance"" who inspires you in a way no other could have. Perhaps you meet your spouse, make life-long friends, or land an internship giving you exposure to a new field you otherwise would've never explored. In not attending that prestigious university you wanted, you may have dodged some tragedy or difficulty. Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ may have protected you from being led astray. Nothing which happens in your life is good or bad as you may perceive it. Only Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ who is Al-Aleem (Knower) of all things, knows what's best. All we can do is move forward, trying to connect the dots looking back - but even then, our story is still being written, and we don't know how this story ends.In a hadith narration, Prophet Muhammad ﷺ says to Aisha (ra): ""show gentleness, for if gentleness is found in anything, it beautifies it and when it is taken out from anything it damages it.""  [1] and in Sahih Muslim,  ""A'isha, verily Allah is kind and He loves kindness and confers upon kindness which he does not confer upon severity and does not confer upon anything else besides it (kindness).""  [2]Here are the remaining four verses that metion Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ as Al-Lateef in the Qur'an: لَّا تُدْرِكُهُ ٱلْأَبْصَـٰرُ وَهُوَ يُدْرِكُ ٱلْأَبْصَـٰرَ ۖ وَهُوَ ٱللَّطِيفُ ٱلْخَبِيرُLaa tudrikuhul absaaru wa Huwa yudrikul absaara wa huwal Lateeful KhabeerEnglish Translation: ""Vision perceives Him not, but He perceives [all] vision; and He is the Subtle, the Acquainted."" — (Qur'an 6:103) وَٱذْكُرْنَ مَا يُتْلَىٰ فِى بُيُوتِكُنَّ مِنْ ءَايَـٰتِ ٱللَّهِ وَٱلْحِكْمَةِ ۚ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ لَطِيفًا خَبِيرًاWazkurna maa yutlaa fee bu yootikunna min aayaatil laahi wal Hikmah; innal laaha kaana lateefan Khabeera (section 4)English Translation: ""And remember what is recited in your houses of the verses of Allah and wisdom.

And no soul perceives what it will earn tomorrow, and no soul perceives in what land it will die. Indeed, Allah is Knowing and Acquainted."" — (Qur'an 31:34)Allah's سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ knowledge and awareness of all things is not from observation. Rather everything known is from the knowledge of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. This is what is meant by the perfection of attributes. He possesses these qualities intrinsically, and they are His essence. He was al-Khaliq before the first creation was made. He was ar-Raheem before the creation of Adam (as). This is why scholars have mentioned that all of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ actions are derived from His most glorious and perfect names. For us, our names are derived from our actions. We have to prove and qualify ourselves to be called honest, trustworthy, or strong. Someone says I am strong, and we say, okay, pick this heavy thing up. We could infer from their muscles that they are strong, but that's only due to the weight training they had to do first. Whereas the qualities and attributes of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ just are and always have been. They are eternal and part of His being. The actions which come forth are an effect of having these names.Reflection:This name spurs the need to examine oneself or, as Shaykh Tosun Bayrak puts it, ""to be one's own doctor."" Just as Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is all-acquainted, we must ask ourselves if we are aware of what goes in ourselves. If we view the mind as some sort of factory, whatever you think about or consume (i.e., through the media, online videos, education, reading, friendships, etc.), these are all the raw ingredients we're processing through this factory. If all you put in is trash, it'd be hard to expect that we'd be manufacturing luxury goods or treasures. What we put into this factory is likely what we'll get out. Focus on the wrong thing, and you'll get the wrong result.So, this calls for a level of radical honesty to unearth some truth and awareness about oneself; otherwise, what lies underneath remains hidden. What is it that motivates you? Are you too preoccupied with worldly pursuits? People like to think of themselves favorably and are over-confident in desirable traits (e.g., kindness, generosity, intelligence, disciplined, etc.), but would the world around you say the same?The brain and body seeks to preserve, your ego wants to protect you from taking any punches and getting bruised. All this happens without our conscious knowledge, and so in a sense, we can be easily deluded. It takes constant examination to know this game of self-deceit and to understand the tricks of the brain before we can say we're ""acquainted"" or ""totally aware."" We have to prove to others and to ourselves whether we qualify to be worthy of being called by a certain title or name."
الْحَلِيمُ,Al-Haleem,The Clement One,"The Forbearing, The All Magnanimous. The One who delays the punishment for those who deserve it as He may forgive them.","Allah is Al-Haleem (also spelt Al-Halim), the most serene, kind and gentle. He does not punish people for every sin. He tolerates and is most gracious and merciful. He is ever calm and deliberate, never acting hastily, even with the wrongdoers. He gives us the opportunity to learn and be kind.","From the root ha-lam-mim (ح ل م), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be forbearing, mild, lenient, clement, to be forgiving, gentle, deliberate to be leisurely in manner, not hasty, to be calm, serene, to manage one’s temper, to exhibit moderation.","Arabic Root:From the root ha-lam-mim (ح ل م), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be forbearing, mild, lenient, clement, to be forgiving, gentle, deliberate to be leisurely in manner, not hasty, to be calm, serene, to manage one's temper, to exhibit moderation.In the Qur'an, the name Al-Haleem is mentioned 11 times. It is one of the names which emphasizes His compassion and mercy. Just imagine if Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ hastened to His punishment everytime someone erred. Although Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is capable, He does not act with anger or rush to harshness even if we're disobedient, rebellious, or mischievous. وَلَوْ يُؤَاخِذُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلنَّاسَ بِظُلْمِهِم مَّا تَرَكَ عَلَيْهَا مِن دَآبَّةٍۢ وَلَـٰكِن يُؤَخِّرُهُمْ إِلَىٰٓ أَجَلٍۢ مُّسَمًّۭى ۖ فَإِذَا جَآءَ أَجَلُهُمْ لَا يَسْتَـْٔخِرُونَ سَاعَةًۭ ۖ وَلَا يَسْتَقْدِمُونَWa law yu'aakhizul laahun naasa bizulminhim maa taraka ‘alaihaa min daaabbatinw wa laakiny yu'akhkhiruhum ilaaa ajalim musamman fa izaa jaaa'a ajaluhum laa yastaakhiroona saa'atanw wa laa yastaqdimoonEnglish Translation:""And if Allah were to impose blame on the people for their wrongdoing, He would not have left upon the earth any creature, but He defers them for a specified term. And when their term has come, they will not remain behind an hour, nor will they precede [it]."" — (Qur'an 16:61)Now imagine if you had done something you know you shouldn't have and you were caught red-handed, but instead of being reprimanded, the judge chose to forgive you. Wouldn't you express immense gratitude? A sense of redemption would overtake your psyche, and you made a vow to never repeat the same mistake, to walk the straight path. This is the same way we should look at Allah's forbearance, He's patient with His verdict, and He keeps giving us second chances. But some think that they're getting away with it. They fall further and further away from the fold of Islam by repeating the same mistake and are not mindful of the final judgment that awaits them. إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ تَوَلَّوۡاْ مِنكُمۡ يَوۡمَ ٱلۡتَقَى ٱلۡجَمۡعَانِ إِنَّمَا ٱسۡتَزَلَّهُمُ ٱلشَّيۡطَٰنُ بِبَعۡضِ مَا كَسَبُواْۖ وَلَقَدۡ عَفَا ٱللَّهُ عَنۡهُمۡۗ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ حَلِيمٞInnal lazeena tawallaw minkum yawmal taqal jam'aani innamas tazallahumush Shaitaanu biba'di maa kasaboo wa laqad afal laahu anhum; innnal laaha Ghafoorun Haleem (section 16)English Translation:""Indeed, those of you who turned back on the day the two armies met, it was Satan who caused them to slip because of some [blame] they had earned.

And there is not a thing except that it exalts [Allah] by His praise, but you do not understand their [way of] exalting. Indeed, He is ever Forbearing and Forgiving."" — (Qur'an 17:44)Al-Haleem and Al-Ghaffur:This pairing of names of both Al-Haleem and Al-Ghaffur is an important one to highlight. His forbearance does not mean He waits to punish those who sin. He allows us the chance to learn and grow, and we must not forget that He loves to forgive, as He is the most forgiving. Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger ﷺ having said: By Him in Whose Hand is my life, if you were not to commit sin, Allah would sweep you out of existence and He would replace (you by) those people who would commit sin and seek forgiveness from Allah, and He would have pardoned them. [1] إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُمْسِكُ ٱلسَّمَـٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضَ أَن تَزُولَا ۚ وَلَئِن زَالَتَآ إِنْ أَمْسَكَهُمَا مِنْ أَحَدٍۢ مِّنۢ بَعْدِهِۦٓ ۚ إِنَّهُۥ كَانَ حَلِيمًا غَفُورًۭاInnal laaha yumsikus samaawaati wal arda an tazoolaaa; wa la'in zaalataaa in amsa kahumaa min ahadim mim ba'dih; innahoo kaana Haleeman GhafooraaEnglish Translation:""Indeed, Allah holds the heavens and the earth, lest they cease. And if they should cease, no one could hold them [in place] after Him. Indeed, He is Forbearing and Forgiving."" — (Qur'an 35:41)Reflection:We can try to characterize ourselves by this name to be known as 'Abd al-Haleem. This manifests in reality when we have a chance to take revenge but instead opt for forgiveness and gentleness. We take from the example mentioned in the Qur'an where it says, ""inna Ibraaheema la awwaahun haleemm Surely, Ibrahim was most tender-hearted, God-fearing, forbearing."" (Qur'an 9:114) Ibrahim (as) is described in the Qur'an as being awwaahun haleem. He loved His Father because He was tender-hearted. This is despite the fact his father cruelly persecuted him and was an ""enemy to Allah,"" and died as a kafir (disbeliever). Yet he remained compassionate and made du'a asking for His forgiveness until Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ commanded Him to stop. And so, in the Qur'an Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ recognized Ibrahim (as) as being haleem.The names of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ do not describe a quality that is disliked in Himself. Rather, each name is beloved by Him, so if we have a share in it, it will please Him to see it emulated by His servant. At the root, Al-Haleem is an attribute of His love. Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is not just the one who withholds punishment. He is patient just as a mother shows patience out of love for her children. Or like a good friend who knows your faults and your weaknesses. But they stick around and are genuinely concerned about what's best for you. We may push good friends away when we're doing wrong, but when that phase is over, they're still happy to help you with welcoming arms.In the name Al-Lateef, we mentioned a hadith, but we'll expand on it a little further here. The Prophet Muhammad ﷺ says to Aisha (ra): ""show gentleness, for if gentleness is found in anything, it beautifies it and when it is taken out from anything it damages it.""""[2] Positive feedback loops are powerful, probably much more than we'd like to give them credit. Being generous with compliments, especially when observing good, can encourage more of that behavior. Imagine how destructive it would be to a child's development if you were negative or talked down on them whenever they sought praise. The kid would feel lost or helpless. They would struggle to do what's right since they're trying to seek approval. Their entire moral compass is derived from immediate feedback from the environment. The comments of ""don't touch that"" and the gentleness of ""Masha-Allah, you did that!?"" are very instructive. We should strive for gentleness in every instance as it has the power to beautify the situation, and when it's removed from the equation, it damages it. We think as adults, we're not prone to this, but we are. When the effort from the act of making dinner goes unappreciated or, worse, criticized, the pain can be piercing. It can make you question why you even tried in the first place (the answer one can always find solace in is for Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ). At work, when the boss sincerely appreciates the work you've put in, it's rewarding. It beautifies the workspace, and we're happy to show up the next day. Even in a sport like basketball - hearing and seeing the ball swishing through the net is the gentleness that makes the player want to take the next shot.References:[1] Sahih Muslim 2749[2]Sahih (Al-Albani) Sunan Abi Dawud 4808 "
الْعَظِيمُ,Al-Azeem,The Magnificent One,"The Great One, The Mighty, The Tremendous.","Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Azeem, The Supreme Glory and The Greatest. His reality is too great to be fully understood under the human mind's capacity. He is infinitely greater than His creation. It is said, His throne (symbolic of His knowledge and authority) extends over the heavens and the earth, and their care burdens Him not. He is the One deserving the attributes of Exaltment, Glory, Extolement, and Purity from all imperfection.","From the root ayn-za-mim (ع ظ م), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be great, large, big, to be vast, huge, enormous, to be great in rank, importance or dignity, to be imposing, powerful, superior, to be magnificent, honored, revered, to be immense, stupendous, lofty, to be above imperfection and sublime.","Arabic Root:From the root ayn-za-mim (ع ظ م), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be great, large, big, to be vast, huge, enormous, to be great in rank, importance or dignity, to be imposing, powerful, superior, to be magnificent, honored, revered, to be immense, stupendous, lofty, to be above imperfection and sublime.Understanding Azeem as it is mentioned in the Qur'an:When it comes to Al-Azeem (Al-Azim), we need to understand that with Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ there are no limits or restrictions. He is tremendous in all aspects. His mercy is tremendous, His ability, His strength, His knowledge, His generosity are all as great as can be. He is truly the possessor of excellence. He is Al-Azeem, The Greatest in all His beautiful qualities and attributes. This name is mentioned nine times in the Qur'an but is also used to describe things more generally as Azeem (tremendous). For example, His punishment in the hereafter is described as azeem. The Qur'an (15:87), the throne (27:26, 27:23), His grace (33:35), the day of judgment (83:5), the trials and tribulations of the children of Israel (7:141), His rewards (64:15), the upright character of Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) (68:4) are all referred to as azeem. فَسَبِّحْ بِٱسْمِ رَبِّكَ ٱلْعَظِيمِFasabbih bismi rabbikal azeemEnglish Translation:""So exalt the name of your Lord, the Most Great."" — (Qur'an 55:96) & (Qur'an 69:52)Connecting with this name in your Salah:Be mindful of this name when you go into Ruku and recite, سُبْحَانَ رَبِّيَ الْعَظِيمِ subhana rabbiyal azeem meaning, ""Glorious is my Lord the Magnificent."" [1] Think of the words you're saying as you recite them and understand the implications behind them. Why do you offer prayer? What is it your attending to? We want Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ to forgive us, to give us the best life in this world and in the next, to ease our tasks and make us better Muslims for Al-Azeem is tremendous and all capable. ٱللَّهُ  لَآ  إِلَٰهَ  إِلَّا  هُوَ  ٱلۡحَيُّ  ٱلۡقَيُّومُۚ  لَا  تَأۡخُذُهُۥ  سِنَةٞ  وَلَا  نَوۡمٞۚ  لَّهُۥ  مَا  فِي  ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ  وَمَا  فِي  ٱلۡأَرۡضِۗ  مَن  ذَا  ٱلَّذِي  يَشۡفَعُ  عِندَهُۥٓ  إِلَّا  بِإِذۡنِهِۦۚ  يَعۡلَمُ  مَا  بَيۡنَ  أَيۡدِيهِمۡ  وَمَا  خَلۡفَهُمۡۖ  وَلَا  يُحِيطُونَ  بِشَيۡءٖ  مِّنۡ  عِلۡمِهِۦٓ  إِلَّا  بِمَا  شَآءَۚ  وَسِعَ  كُرۡسِيُّهُ  ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ  وَٱلۡأَرۡضَۖ  وَلَا  يَـُٔودُهُۥ  حِفۡظُهُمَاۚ  وَهُوَ  ٱلۡعَلِيُّ  ٱلۡعَظِيمُAllahu laaa ilaaha illaa Huwal Haiyul Qaiyoom; laa taakhuzuhoo sinatunw wa laa nawm; lahoo maa fissamaawaati wa maa fil ard; man zal lazee yashfa'u indahooo illaa bi-iznih; ya'lamu maa baina aydeehim wa maa khalfahum wa laa yuheetoona bishai'im min ‘ilmihee illaa bimaa shaaa'; wasi'a Kursiyyuhus samaawaati wal arda wa laa Ya'ooduhoo hifzuhumaa; wa Huwal Aliyyul ‘AzeemEnglish Translation:""Allah - there is no deity except Him, the Ever-Living, the Sustainer of [all] existence.

There is no obstacle too large, no dream too big that Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ cannot fulfill. He can make any aspect of your life great. Even in the mundane, He can show you the beauty in it. The Prophet ﷺ would make this du'a when distressed which calls upon two of Allah's attributes of being Al-Azim and Al-Haleem (The Clement One).Narrated Ibn Abbas: The Prophet ﷺ used to invoke Allah at the time of distress, saying, [2]لاَ إِلَهَ إِلاَّ اللَّهُ الْعَظِيمُ الْحَلِيمُ لاَ إِلَهَ إِلاَّ اللَّهُ رَبُّ السَّمَوَاتِ وَالأَرْضِ رَبُّ الْعَرْشِ الْعَظِيمِ La ilaha illal-lahu Al-`Azim, al- Halim, La ilaha illal-lahu Rabbu-s-samawati wal-ard wa Rabbu-l- arsh il-azim.English Translation:""There is no God but Allah, the Magnificent, the Forbearing. There is no God but Allah, Lord of the magnificent Throne. There is no God but Allah, Lord of the heavens and Earth, Lord of the generous Throne.""How to tip the scale in your favor with the name Al-Azim: The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""(There are) two words which are dear to the Beneficent (Allah) and very light (easy) for the tongue (to say), but very heavy in weight in the balance. They are: 'Subhan Allah wa-bi hamdihi' and 'Subhan Allah Al-Azim."" [3]This name also brings about humility in all who understand this attribute of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. As mentioned previously, a constant theme in many of these names is that we're deluded in worldly pursuits. A person who sees success can think of himself as being grandeur. But in reality, nothing can eclipse Allah's greatness. We can think of ourselves as big fish, not realizing we're swimming in a little pond.In another case, we unknowingly may be influenced by a person with high status. Many fall into a trance of some sort, bending over backward to appease their demands. If, at that moment, Al-Azeem popped into your mind, it takes away the power they may hold over you. We realize yes, they may be wealthy, famous, and influential, but in comparison to Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ they are nothing. Therefore, you don't need their approval. The only support we need, the only one that matters and can genuinely help us, is Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ.Another authentic supplication we can learn from the hadith which incorporates a variety of Allah's names and attributes. It was narrated that 'Ubadah bin As-Samit said: ""The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'Whoever wakes up in the morning and says upon waking: [4] لاَ إِلَهَ إِلاَّ اللَّهُ وَحْدَهُ لاَ شَرِيكَ لَهُ لَهُ الْمُلْكُ وَلَهُ الْحَمْدُ وَهُوَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ سُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ وَالْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ وَلاَ إِلَهَ إِلاَّ اللَّهُ وَاللَّهُ أَكْبَرُ وَلاَ حَوْلَ وَلاَ قُوَّةَ إِلاَّ بِاللَّهِ الْعَلِيِّ الْعَظِيمِLa ilaha illallah wahdahu la sharika lahu, lahul-mulku wa lahul-hamdu, wa Huwa ‘ala kulli shay'in Qadir; Subhan-Allah walhamdu lillahi, wa la ilaha illallahu, wa Allahu Akbar, wa la hawla wa la quwwata illa billahil-Aliyil-AzimEnglish Translation:""None has the right to be worshipped but Allah alone, with no partner or associate. His is the dominion and all praise is to Him, and He is Able to do all things. Glory is to Allah, praise is to Allah, none has the right to be worshiped but Allah, Allah is the Most Great, and there is no power and no strength except with Allah, the Most High, the Most Supreme""The hadith then adds, ""then he supplicates Rabbighfirli (O Lord, forgive me), he will be forgiven.'"" Walid said: ""Or he said: then if he supplicated, it will be answered for him then if he stood up and performed ablution and then performed prayer, his prayer would be accepted.""References:[1] Sahih (Darussalam) Jami At-Tirmidhi 262[2] Sahih al-Bukhari 6345 & Sahih Muslim 2730[3] Sahih al-Bukhari 7563[4] Sahih (Darussalam) Sunan Ibn Majah 3878"
الْغَفُور,Al-Ghafur,The All-Forgiving,"The All-Forgiving, The Forgiving, The One who forgives a lot.","Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Ghafoor (in Arabic: ٱلْغَفُورُ), He is The One who completely forgives our sins and faults. His forgiveness is unlimited, and He is all compassionate. He is most high; His forgiveness extends to all who turn to him in humility and seek repentance.","From the root ghayn-fa-ra (غ ف ر), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to cover, veil, conceal, hide to pardon, to forgive, to set aright, to cover a thing, to protect it from dirt.","Arabic Root:From the root ghayn-fa-ra (غ ف ر), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to cover, veil, conceal, hide to pardon, to forgive, to set aright, to cover a thing, to protect it from dirt.As we mentioned in the name Al-Ghaffar. There are three accompanying names, Al-Ghafir, Al-Ghaffar, and Al-Ghaffur. Al-Ghafir connotes His nature of being the forgiver, whereas Al-Ghaffar and Al-Ghaffur are more grandiose, meaning the great forgiver, the all-forgiving. Linguistically these two names are not synonymous even though both relate to the ideas of His forgiveness and share the same root. Scholars note that Al-Ghaffar describes His ability to forgive as being great. It is all-encompassing, doesn't matter the circumstance, the individuals, or the degree of sin. If Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ wills, He can forgive. Al-Ghafur refers to the vastness, perpetual nature of forgiving time after time. Together these three names are mentioned in the Qur'an ninety-eight times. Of these 98 mentions, Al-Ghafur appears 91 times. نَبِّئْ عِبَادِىٓ أَنِّىٓ أَنَا ٱلْغَفُورُ ٱلرَّحِيمُNabbi' ‘ibaadeee annneee anal Ghafoorur RaheemEnglish Translation:[O Muhammad], inform My servants that it is I who am the Forgiving, the Merciful. — (Qur'an 15:49) نُزُلًۭا مِّنْ غَفُورٍۢ رَّحِيمٍۢNuzulam min Ghafoorir Raheem (section 4)English Translation:""As accommodation from a [Lord who is] Forgiving and Merciful."" — (Qur'an 41:32) إِنَّمَا  حَرَّمَ  عَلَيۡكُمُ  ٱلۡمَيۡتَةَ  وَٱلدَّمَ  وَلَحۡمَ  ٱلۡخِنزِيرِ  وَمَآ  أُهِلَّ  بِهِۦ  لِغَيۡرِ  ٱللَّهِۖ  فَمَنِ  ٱضۡطُرَّ  غَيۡرَ  بَاغٖ  وَلَا  عَادٖ  فَلَآ  إِثۡمَ  عَلَيۡهِۚ  إِنَّ  ٱللَّهَ  غَفُورٞ  رَّحِيمٌInnamaa harrama ‘alaikumul maitata waddama wa lahmal khinzeeri wa maaa uhilla bihee lighairil laahi famanid turra ghaira baaghinw wa laa ‘aadin falaaa isma ‘alaih; innal laaha Ghafoorur RaheemEnglish Translation:""He has only forbidden to you dead animals, blood, the flesh of swine, and that which has been dedicated to other than Allah. But whoever is forced [by necessity], neither desiring [it] nor transgressing [its limit], there is no sin upon him. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful."" — (Qur'an 2:173)Reflection:From this name, we learn the importance of maghfirah, which means to seek the forgiveness of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. The believer benefits in knowing that Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Ghaffur because it reminds us that we worship an oft-forgiving Lord. Despite making the same mistake repeatedly, we're not doomed by our past.Narrated Abu Huraira: I heard the Prophet ﷺ saying, ""If somebody commits a sin and then says, 'O my Lord! I have sinned, please forgive me!' And his Lord says, 'My servant has known that he has a Lord who forgives sins and punishes for it, I therefore have forgiven my servant (his sins).' Then he remains without committing any sin for a while and then again commits another sin and says, 'O my Lord, I have committed another sin, please forgive me,' and Allah says, 'My servant has known that he has a Lord who forgives sins and punishes for it, I therefore have forgiven my slave (his sin). Then he remains without Committing any another sin for a while and then commits another sin (for the third time) and says, 'O my Lord, I have committed another sin, please forgive me,' and Allah says, 'My servant knows that he has a Lord who forgives sins and punishes for it. I have forgiven My servant - three times.'"" [1]A du'a from Abu Bakr al-Sadiq (ra), ""O Allah, You know me better than I know myself, and I know myself better than these people who praise me. Make me better than what they think of me, and forgive those sins of mine of which they have no knowledge, and do not hold me responsible for what they say."" [2] This covers an essential aspect of the names that share the root gh-f-r. It's not just a name of forgiveness but the idea of concealment. But not in a conniving way, to conceal something ugly and to beautify it. Allah conceals our faults from being exposed, so we're not under public scrutiny. It should inspire us to become better knowing we've been given a second, third, or fourth chance and to help uplift others. So, His mercy extends to forgive perpetually and to hide our faults from being exposed.Abu Huraira reported Allah's Apostle ﷺ as saying: The servant (whose fault) Allah conceals in this world, Allah would also conceal (his faults) on the Day of Resurrection.  [3] and in a different narration, Abu Huraira reported Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) as saying: The servant (who conceals) the faults of others in this world, Allah would conceal his faults on the Day of Resurrection. [4]The analogy often used is that every time we sin, a crack appears, which uncovers or exposes us. When we ask for istighfar (seeking Allah's forgiveness) - we're asking for Him to show us His mercy, to protect us by repairing or covering what's been exposed. Indeed Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is both Al-Ghaffar (The Great Forgiver), the one who forgives big and small sins, and Al-Ghaffur (The Oft-Forgiver), the one who forgives time and time again.References:[1] Sahih al-Bukhari 7507[2] Silsilah al-Huda wa Noor no. 640[3] Sahih Muslim 2590a [4] Sahih Muslim 2590b"
الشَّكُورُ,Ash-Shakur/Ash-Shakoor,The Acknowledging One,"The Grateful, The Appreciative, The Rewarder of Thankfulness.","Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Ash-Shakur (in Arabic: ٱلْشَّكُورُ), meaning the most grateful, the rewarder of good deeds, and is most appreciative. He notices the smallest of our acts of righteousness and rewards us for them in this life or the next. He is bountiful in giving and bestows great rewards for the smallest amount of good.","From the root shin-kaf-ra (ش ك ر), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to praise or commend for a benefit or benefits to acknowledge beneficence, to offer thanks, acknowledgement, to be thankful, grateful, to produce, supply, give forth bountifully.","Arabic Root:From the root shin-kaf-ra (ش ك ر), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to praise or commend for a benefit or benefits to acknowledge beneficence, to offer thanks, acknowledgement, to be thankful, grateful, to produce, supply, give forth bountifully.There are two names here, Ash-Shakir (The Recogniser and Rewarder of good) and Ash-Shakur (The Appreciative). Al-Shakir is mentioned in the Qur'an twice, whereas Al-Shakur is mentioned four times. Below we've included an example of the usage of Al-Shakir, and you will see the name Shakur in other verses. One thing to note is that Shakur is more emphatic or exaggerated form. ۞إِنَّ  ٱلصَّفَا  وَٱلۡمَرۡوَةَ  مِن  شَعَآئِرِ  ٱللَّهِۖ  فَمَنۡ  حَجَّ  ٱلۡبَيۡتَ  أَوِ  ٱعۡتَمَرَ  فَلَا  جُنَاحَ  عَلَيۡهِ  أَن  يَطَّوَّفَ  بِهِمَاۚ  وَمَن  تَطَوَّعَ  خَيۡرٗا  فَإِنَّ  ٱللَّهَ  شَاكِرٌ  عَلِيمٌInnas Safaa wal-Marwata min sha'aaa'iril laahi faman hajjal Baita awi'tamara falaa junaaha ‘alaihi ai yattawwafa bihimaa; wa man tatawwa'a khairan fa innal laaha Shaakirun AleemEnglish Translation:""Indeed, as-Safa and al-Marwah are among the symbols of Allah. So whoever makes Hajj to the House or performs ‘umrah - there is no blame upon him for walking between them. And whoever volunteers good - then indeed, Allah is appreciative and Knowing."" — (Qur'an 2:158)Ash-Shakur is a display of the expansiveness of Allah's love. He is the one who has given us the gift of life. Everything we see, love, and touch are because Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ has allowed it to be that way. Yet He tells us, He appreciates and accepts all deeds, no matter how small. He is all-watchful and all-grateful to us. مَّا يَفْعَلُ ٱللَّهُ بِعَذَابِكُمْ إِن شَكَرْتُمْ وَءَامَنتُمْ ۚ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ شَاكِرًا عَلِيمًۭاMaa yaf'alul laahu bi ‘azaabikum in shakartum wa aamantum; wa kaanal laahu Shaakiran Aleema (End Juz 5)English Translation:""What can Allah gain by your punishment, if ye are grateful and ye believe? Nay, it is Allah that recogniseth (all good), and knoweth all things."" — (Qur'an 4:147 )Multiplying good deeds:Moreover, He is the one who multiples the rewards of His servant's many folds. It is also only Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ who has the power to multiple without any measure or restriction. As an illustrative example, here's what the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said on good deeds committed while fasting: ""Every good deed of the son of Adam will be multiplied manifold. A good deed will be multiplied ten times up to as many as seven hundred times, or as much as Allah wills."" [1] Also, Ibn Umar narrated that one day: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to his Companions: “Say ‘Glory is to Allah and with His Praise (Subhan Allah, wa bihamdih) a hundred times. Whoever says [it] one time, it is written for him ten, and whoever says it ten (times), it is written for him a hundred, and whoever says it a hundred (times), it is written for him a thousand, and whoever increases, Allah will increase for him, and whoever seeks Allah's forgiveness, [Allah] will forgive him.” [2]Pairing Al-Ghafur and Al-Shakur: وَقَالُواْ ٱلۡحَمۡدُ لِلَّهِ ٱلَّذِيٓ أَذۡهَبَ عَنَّا ٱلۡحَزَنَۖ إِنَّ رَبَّنَا لَغَفُورٞ شَكُورٌWa qaalul hamdu lillaahil lazeee azhaba ‘annal hazan; inna Rabbanaa la Ghafoorun ShakoorEnglish Translation:""And they will say, “Praise to Allah, who has removed from us [all] sorrow. Indeed, our Lord is Forgiving and Appreciative -"" — (Qur'an 35:34)This pairing of names here conveys Allah's nature of showing mercy and seeing the good in us. Put another way, He frequently forgives, cleansing us of our many sins. He is also accepting of all good that we do, no matter how inconsequential it may appear.The promise of Jannah:The promise of an eternal paradise for a short-lived time on earth doing good deeds is an example of an immense reward for relatively little effort. In the Qur'an, it says to the people in paradise, ""[They will be told], 'Eat and drink in satisfaction for what you put forth in the days past.'"" (Qur'an 69:24) Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ recognizes and rewards the action of His servants. This is why it's important to do good, even when no one sees it. To do good for its own sake because Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ will reward us for it. Any acknowledgment from the outside world is a bonus. Being recognized through an award is nice to have. The real reward we should seek is from Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ who always gives within measure or more than what's due.Reflection:A believer benefits from knowing that Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is al-Shakur. If Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ can be grateful to His servants when He has no need to be, and He continually forgives and rewards; then perhaps we can learn to be the same amongst ourselves. In a hadith, Prophet Muhammad ﷺ conveys a similar message, ""He who does not thank the people is not thankful to Allah."" [3]This is also a reminder to thank Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ, praise Him for His gratitude. Even this will render some benefit to you, as Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ says in the Qur'an, ""If you are grateful, I will surely increase you [in favor]"" (Qur'an 14:17) and also, ""If you disbelieve - indeed, Allah is Free from need of you. And He does not approve for His servants disbelief. And if you are grateful, He approves it for you; and no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another. Then to your Lord is your return, and He will inform you about what you used to do. Indeed, He is Knowing of that within the breasts [hearts]."" (Qur'an 39:7). Our praise and obedience will work in a loop that only further propels us to the entrance of Jannah. We can never do enough to repay the blessings He has bestowed on us. We should try to keep this front of mind as we can feel immense happiness and love to know we have such a loving and appreciative creator. ذَٰلِكَ ٱلَّذِي يُبَشِّرُ ٱللَّهُ عِبَادَهُ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّـٰلِحَٰتِۗ قُل لَّآ أَسۡـَٔلُكُمۡ عَلَيۡهِ أَجۡرًا إِلَّا ٱلۡمَوَدَّةَ فِي ٱلۡقُرۡبَىٰۗ وَمَن يَقۡتَرِفۡ حَسَنَةٗ نَّزِدۡ لَهُۥ فِيهَا حُسۡنًاۚ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٞ شَكُورٌZaalikal lazee yubash shirul laahu ‘ibaadahul lazeena aamanoo wa ‘amilus saalihaat; qul laaa as'alukum ‘alaihi ajran illal mawaddata fil qurbaa; wa mai yaqtarif hasanatan nazid lahoo feehaa husnaa; innal laaha Ghafoorun ShakoorEnglish Translation:""It is that of which Allah gives good tidings to His servants who believe and do righteous deeds. Say, [O Muhammad], “I do not ask you for this message any payment [but] only good will through kinship.” And whoever commits a good deed - We will increase for him good therein. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Appreciative."" — (Qur'an 42:23)The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""I saw a man going about in Jannah (and enjoying himself) as a reward for cutting from the middle of the road, a tree which was causing inconvenience to the Muslims."" According to the narration in Al-Bukhari and Muslim: Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, ""While a man was walking, he saw a thorny branch on the road, so he removed it and Allah appreciated his action and forgave him.""

الْعَلِيُّ,Al-Aliyy / Al-Alee,The High,The Exalted and High. The One who is High in all respects.,"Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Aliyy (in Arabic: ٱلْعَلِيُّ), the most exalted and all high. He exceeds all others, and there is nothing higher. He is the one whose rank and station are the highest. He is above all that has or will ever be.","From the root ayn-lam-waw (ع ل و), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be high, elevated, lofty to be exalted, to rise up, to ascend to be higher, to exceed, surpass, to overcome, overwhelm, to advance, promote, rise above, to mount, be overtop, eminent.","Arabic Root:From the root ayn-lam-waw (ع ل و), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be high, elevated, lofty to be exalted, to rise up, to ascend to be higher, to exceed, surpass, to overcome, overwhelm, to advance, promote, rise above, to mount, be overtop, eminent.Al-Aliyy, Al-Ala, and Muta-Ali:There are two names, Al-Aliyy (The High) and Al-Ala (The Most High). This is separate from the 78th name, Al-Muta'Ali, which means The High Above, The Exalted. These names describe the transcendent nature of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ and His loftiness when compared to all other creations. Imam al-Ghazali mentions, ""[He] is the one above whose rank there is no rank, and all ranks are inferior to Him. This is because high is derived from 'height', and 'height' is taken from elevation that is the opposite of lowness."" Al-Aliyy is the all-high without any reference point. This is an intrinsic quality. Al-Muta-Ali is a variation that is a more intensified form.In the Qur'an, the name Al-Ala appears five times, Al-Aliyy five, and Al-Muta'Ali only once. سَبِّحِ ٱسْمَ رَبِّكَ ٱلْأَعْلَىSabbihisma Rabbikal A'laaEnglish Translation:""Exalt the name of your Lord, the Most High,"" — (Qur'an 87:1)Connecting with this name in your salah:His essence to being above His creation in a literal sense. This may be more subjective, but when we cry out to Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ in a time of need, we have this intuition to look up to the sky. We make du'a seeking His guidance or help. Another act of submission is how we bow our heads in ruku or sujood to show He سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is higher. At our lowest point in sujood (prostration), we say, Subhana Rabbi Al Ala meaning, ""Glory is to my Lord, the Most High.""[1] And in the Qur'an, ""They fear their Lord above them, and they do what they are commanded."" (Qur'an 16:50)Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is above:The other meaning refers to the highness of His attributes being above all. He is above all creation in all respects. As we've studied up to this name of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ, many of His qualities often indicate a form of being grand or perpetual. That is why it's The Most Merciful, The Most Gracious, The All-Hearing, and The All-Seeing.Being above the Throne:""It is He who created the heavens and earth in six days and then established Himself above the Throne. He knows what penetrates into the earth and what emerges from it and what descends from the heaven and what ascends therein; and He is with you wherever you are. And Allah, of what you do, is Seeing."" (Quran 57:4) It is oft-mentioned in the Qur'an that Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is above the Throne or ascended the Throne, (i.e., sits on the Throne).The throne is often interpreted as being the place which Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ governs the entire universe, the place where He showers blessings of life and power. Imam al-Ghazali writes, ""For the throne is the most exalted body, and is above all bodies: an object far beyond determination and calculation in terms of the boundaries of bodies and the measure proper to them; it is above all bodies in rank.Special mention is made of."" Many other verses mention Him being above the throne. We've included them here for your reference: 13:2, 10:3, 7:54, 25:59, 20:5. The most well-known verse would be ""the Verse of the Throne"" or Ayatul Kursi: ٱللَّهُ  لَآ  إِلَٰهَ  إِلَّا  هُوَ  ٱلۡحَيُّ  ٱلۡقَيُّومُۚ  لَا  تَأۡخُذُهُۥ  سِنَةٞ  وَلَا  نَوۡمٞۚ  لَّهُۥ  مَا  فِي  ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ  وَمَا  فِي  ٱلۡأَرۡضِۗ  مَن  ذَا  ٱلَّذِي  يَشۡفَعُ  عِندَهُۥٓ  إِلَّا  بِإِذۡنِهِۦۚ  يَعۡلَمُ  مَا  بَيۡنَ  أَيۡدِيهِمۡ  وَمَا  خَلۡفَهُمۡۖ  وَلَا  يُحِيطُونَ  بِشَيۡءٖ  مِّنۡ  عِلۡمِهِۦٓ  إِلَّا  بِمَا  شَآءَۚ  وَسِعَ  كُرۡسِيُّهُ  ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ  وَٱلۡأَرۡضَۖ  وَلَا  يَـُٔودُهُۥ  حِفۡظُهُمَاۚ  وَهُوَ  ٱلۡعَلِيُّ  ٱلۡعَظِيمُAllahu laaa ilaaha illaa Huwal Haiyul Qaiyoom; laa taakhuzuhoo sinatunw wa laa nawm; lahoo maa fissamaawaati wa maa fil ard; man zal lazee yashfa'u indahooo illaa bi-iznih; ya'lamu maa baina aydeehim wa maa khalfahum wa laa yuheetoona bishai'im min ‘ilmihee illaa bimaa shaaa'; wasi'a Kursiyyuhus samaawaati wal arda wa laa Ya'ooduhoo hifzuhumaa; wa Huwal Aliyyul AzeemEnglish Translation:""Allah - there is no deity except Him, the Ever-Living, the Sustainer of [all] existence. Neither drowsiness overtakes Him nor sleep. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. Who is it that can intercede with Him except by His permission? He knows what is [presently] before them and what will be after them, and they encompass not a thing of His knowledge except for what He wills. His Kursi extends over the heavens and the earth, and their preservation tires Him not. And He is the Most High, the Most Great."" — (Qur'an 2:255)Things are elevated to Him: There are also verses that mention things ascending to Him, meaning they are low and must rise upwards to Him, ""Whoever desires honor [through power] - then to Allah belongs all honor. To Him ascends good speech, and righteous work raises it."" (Qur'an 35:10) and ""The angels and the Spirit will ascend to Him during a Day the extent of which is fifty thousand years."" (Qur'an 70:4)Ibn Abbas reported that Allah's Apostle ﷺ used to supplicate during the time of trouble (in these words): La ilaha illallahul-Adhimul-Haleem. La ilaha illallahu Rabbul-‘Arshil-‘Adhim. La ilaha illallahu Rabbus-samawati, wa Rabbul-ardi, wa Rabbul-‘Arshil- Kareem. ""There is no god but Allah, the Great, the Tolerant, there is no god but Allah, the Lord of the Magnificent Throne There is no god but Allah, the Lord of the Heaven and the earth, the Lord of the Edifying Throne.""[2]Reflection:The believer benefits in knowing that Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Aliyy. He is The Most-High, The Exalted. There is no one else we need to rely upon but Him. The believers will be among those who are higher. Musa (as) was commanded to appear before Firawn and cast his staff. He was fearful as he did not know what would happen next, but Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ comforts him in saying, ""Fear not! Lo! thou art the higher."" وَلَا تَنفَعُ ٱلشَّفَٰعَةُ عِندَهُۥٓ إِلَّا لِمَنۡ أَذِنَ لَهُۥۚ حَتَّىٰٓ إِذَا فُزِّعَ عَن قُلُوبِهِمۡ قَالُواْ مَاذَا قَالَ رَبُّكُمۡۖ قَالُواْ ٱلۡحَقَّۖ وَهُوَ ٱلۡعَلِيُّ ٱلۡكَبِيرُWa laa tanfa'ush shafaa'atu ‘indahooo illaa liman azina lah; hattaaa izaa fuzzi'a ‘an quloobihim qaaloo maazaa qaala Rabbukum; qaalul haqq, wa Huwal Aliyul KabeerEnglish Translation:""And intercession does not benefit with Him except for one whom He permits. [And those wait] until, when terror is removed from their hearts, they will say [to one another], “What has your Lord said?” They will say, “The truth.” And He is the Most High, the Grand."" — (Quran 34:23)Another hadith narration provides us with a supplication we can recite using the name Al-Aliyy. Best for the one who may find themselves wrestling to learn the Qur'an and/or it's concepts. It was narrated that Ibn Abi Awfa said: ""A man came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and said: 'I cannot learn anything of the Quran; teach me something that I can say instead of reciting the Quran.' He said: 'Say: SubhanAllah, wal-hamdulilah, wa la illaha ill-Allah, wa Allahu Akbar, wa la hawla wa la quwwata illa Billahil-aliy al-azim (Glory be to Allah, praise be to Allah, there is none worthy of worship except Allah, Allah is Most Great, and there is no power and no strength except with Allah the Exalted and Magnificent).'""

الْكَبِيرُ,Al-Kabeer,The Great,"The Most Great, The All-Great, The Greatest.","The name Al-Kabeer (in Arabic: ٱلْكَبِيرُ) is the 37th name of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ meaning the perfection of greatness. The heart of the believer knows Allah is the essence of perfection and nothing is comparable to him. His greatness is beyond measure, and His being is unimaginable to the human mind.","From the root kaf-ba-ra (ك ب ر), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be great in rank, dignity, nobility, majesty to be great in size, vast, formidable to be great in age, oldest to be great in learning, most knowing to have rights above all others.","Arabic Root:From the root kaf-ba-ra (ك ب ر), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be great in rank, dignity, nobility, majesty to be great in size, vast, formidable to be great in age, oldest to be great in learning, most knowing to have rights above all others.In Arabic, the word kabir (كبير) is used by modern Arabic speakers to describe something great, big or large, often in a physical sense. The usage of the definite article ""al"" before the name is demonstrative of being THE biggest or THE greatest. But with Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ this is not limited in a physical sense. The name Al-Kabir is often used in tandem with Al-Aliyy (The Most High), likely to illustrate that Allah is great in all respects, greater than any mental constructs we may have of Him. It is a name of Allah's perfection, not meant in a comparative sense. He is greatness and is alone in His greatness. ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ هُوَ ٱلْحَقُّ وَأَنَّ مَا يَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِهِ ٱلْبَـٰطِلُ وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ هُوَ ٱلْعَلِىُّ ٱلْكَبِيرُZaalika bi annal laaha Huwal Haqqu wa anna maa yad'oona min doonihil baatilu wa annal laaha Huwal Aliyyul Kabeer (section 3)English Translation:""That is because Allah is the Truth, and that what they call upon other than Him is falsehood, and because Allah is the Most High, the Grand."" — (Qur'an 31:30) وَلَا تَنفَعُ ٱلشَّفَٰعَةُ عِندَهُۥٓ إِلَّا لِمَنۡ أَذِنَ لَهُۥۚ حَتَّىٰٓ إِذَا فُزِّعَ عَن قُلُوبِهِمۡ قَالُواْ مَاذَا قَالَ رَبُّكُمۡۖ قَالُواْ ٱلۡحَقَّۖ وَهُوَ ٱلۡعَلِيُّ ٱلۡكَبِيرُWa laa tanfa'ush shafaa'atu 'indahooo illaa liman azina lah; hattaaa izaa fuzzi'a an quloobihim qaaloo maazaa qaala Rabbukum; qaalul haqq, wa Huwal Aliyul KabeerEnglish Translation:""And intercession does not benefit with Him except for one whom He permits.

It's also an attribute of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ you're used to hearing on an everyday basis. In the call to prayer (i.e., the adhan), we say Allahu Akabar meaning ""Allah is greater."" This contains the importance of salah time, to stop all that you're doing when the adhan comes on, and hayya alas salah, meaning ""come to prayer."" Why? Because God is greater - He is greater than whatever else may be preoccupying your time. Here it seems to be used in the comparative sense, but really it's an affirmation of Allah's absoluteness.Although the reference to the last verse of Surah Jumuah is about Jumuah prayer, the message remains true for all your prayers, ""O you who have believed, when [the adhan] is called for the prayer on the day of Jumu'ah [Friday], then proceed to the remembrance of Allah and leave trade. That is better for you, if you only knew."" It's only befitting that the next part in the adhan mentions hayya alal falah ""come to success."" Narrated `Abdullah: I asked the Prophet (ﷺ) ""Which deed is the dearest to Allah?"" He replied, ""To offer the prayers at their early stated fixed times."" [1]Al-Kabir - testament of tawhid:Upon realizing only Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ possesses true greatness, we, therefore, praise Him alone. Only Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ has true worth. Everything else is perishable and exists in a temporary state. The one who is only conscious and glorifies himself lives in denial of this truth. Consciousness of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ and His greatness affirms His divine oneness and allows a person to live beyond his selfish desires and pursuits. It creates the space for detachment from oneself and to live for Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ, and Allah knows what's best for His creation. ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ هُوَ ٱلْحَقُّ وَأَنَّ مَا يَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِهِۦ هُوَ ٱلْبَـٰطِلُ وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ هُوَ ٱلْعَلِىُّ ٱلْكَبِيرُZaalika bi annal laaha Huwal haqqu wa anna maa yad'oona min doonihee huwal baatilu wa annal laaha Huwal Aliyyul kabeerEnglish Translation:""That is because Allah is the Truth, and that which they call upon other than Him is falsehood, and because Allah is the Most High, the Grand."" — (Qur'an 22:62)Reflection:This name is also a reminder to check our egos and to be humble because we know Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is far superior. Those who directly challenge Him will be among the losers. It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: “Allah, the Glorified, says: ‘Pride / Grandeur is My cloak and greatness My robe, and whoever competes with Me with regard to either of them, I shall throw him into Hell.'” [2] Even those who don't directly challenge Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ but are narcissistic and have a delusional sense of self-worth - they may bully, humiliate and berate others but will be faced Allah's vengeance. We are all created equal in the sight of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. The better one is determined by moral excellence. In the Qur'an, Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ says, ""O mankind, indeed We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another. Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you. Indeed, Allah is Knowing and Acquainted."" (Qur'an 49:13)Mu'sab b. Sa'd reported on the authority of his father that a desert Arab came to Allah's Messenger ﷺ and said to him: Teach me the words which I should (often) utter. He said: Utter, [3] لاَ إِلَهَ إِلاَّ اللَّهُ وَحْدَهُ لاَ شَرِيكَ لَهُ اللَّهُ أَكْبَرُ كَبِيرًا وَالْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ كَثِيرًا سُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ لاَ حَوْلَ وَلاَ قُوَّةَ إِلاَّ بِاللَّهِ الْعَزِيزِ الْحَكِيمِla 'ilah 'iila alllah wahdah la sharik lah alllah 'akbar kabiran walhamd lillah kathiran subhan alllah rabb alealamin la hawl wala quwwat 'iila bialllah aleaziz alhakimEnglish Translation:""There is no god but Allah, the One, having no partner with Him. Allah is the Greatest of the great and all praise is due to Him. Hallowed be Allah, the Lord of the worlds, there is no Might and Power but that of Allah, the All-Powerful and the Wise.""The Greatness within you:Another way a believer benefits from knowing Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Kabeer is acknowledging and respecting the beauty that is you. If we understand the superlative that Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is the highest and greatest then it must be that everything that comes from Him must be perfect and great in its own respect. Whether or not we recognize and accept our beauty and our greatness is a different question altogether. To begin transforming self-loathing to self-loving has to do with reprogramming the story that's been conditioned in your psyche and reworking it. It takes some believing and trust to attach a new story to take its place, and whose word is greater to follow and trust than Al-Kabeer?In the Qur'an, Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ mentions His creation as being molded perfectly, ""It is Allah who made for you the earth a place of settlement and the sky a ceiling and formed you and perfected your forms and provided you with good things. That is Allah, your Lord; then blessed is Allah, Lord of the worlds."" (Qur'an 40:64) and also, ""We have certainly created man in the best of stature;"" Qur'an 95:4 Would you refute Him, saying, ""look, I respect your opinion but I am objectively ugly. See my left eye is slightly bigger than my right!"" It may seem ridiculous, but we are all guilty of doing this in some fashion. This is probably even more exaggerated today because of the high beauty standards pushed on by social media.Another beautiful ayat from the Qur'an worth deeply reflecting on is, ""You now see the mountains and consider them firmly fixed, but then they shall pass away even as clouds pass away. That will be the handiwork of Allah Who has created everything with perfect wisdom. He is well aware of what you do."" (Qur'an 27:88) The commentators of the Qur'an interpret ""pass away"" as a reference to the Earth itself, meaning that the world, believed to be solid, is actually as ephemeral as a cloud. It is temporary.We can even try to extrapolate from this ayah on a personal level. Things that may seem firmly fixed will pass. If we can accept this, we can learn to let go of any emotional attachments. There is nothing that exists with absolute permanence but Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. Holding on to what was or is, is an impossible task. The one who caused the change is Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ, and He is the one who has perfect wisdom.We can experience inner peace only with acceptance of what He has willed. If we're flexible with changing events, we can see the many blessings Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ has given each one of us. Try to drop the anxiety and self-criticism if you're not doing what you feel you're supposed to be doing - or where you think you should be. Harsh criticism of yourself serves no purpose but to hinder future progress. Instead, just focus on the smallest step you can take to improve your situation. Just as Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ spreads His perfection through His creation, we work to perfect our inner character. Emotional temperance, knowledge, deen, love, family, friendships, etc. Whatever else happens is up to Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ, and we know that He is Al-Kabeer, The Greatest.References:[1] Sahih al-Bukhari 527[2] Hasan (Darussalam) Sunan Ibn Majah 4174 & Sahih (Al-Albani) Sunan Abi Dawud 4090[3] Sahih Muslim 2696"
الْحَفِيظُ,Al-Hafiz / Al-Hafeez / Al-Hafeedh,The Preserver,"The Guarding One, The Protector, The One who Preserves what He created.","Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Hafiz (in Arabic: ٱلْحَفِيظُ), the guardian and protector of everything. He preserves all creations and remembers all that has ever been and all that is. He is the protector of The Qur'an and vowed to safeguard it from being changed or perverted, as was the case with previous scriptures.","From the root ha-fa-za (ح ف ظ), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to preserve, guard, protect, to keep, retain, take care of, tend to, prevent from perishing, or becoming lost, to be watchful, mindful, attentive, and vigilant.","Arabic Root:From the root ha-fa-za (ح ف ظ), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to preserve, guard, protect, to keep, retain, take care of, tend to, prevent from perishing, or becoming lost, to be watchful, mindful, attentive, and vigilant.Al-Hafiz - The Protector:The name of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ Al-Hafiz (other common transliterations include Al-Hafeez or Al-Hafeedh) appears for a total of six times throughout the Qur'an. There are different aspects of this name we can explore. Imam al-Ghazali writes the first is ""perpetuating the existence of existing things and sustaining them, the opposite of which is annihilation."" In this light, we see Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ as the preserver in the sense of being a protector. A name that shows trust in Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ plan for us and humanity as a whole. Every parent dropping their kids off at school, every person caught amid a war or dangerous situation. Or it could be something as simple as entrusting something valuable to someone else; the attribute of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ we need to know is that He is Al-Hafiz. Sheikh Tosun Barak writes, ""He protects His creation from all harm and disharmony. That is how all heavenly bodies speeding in great haste revolve and travel within their destined orbits, instead of clashing with each other."" This is the work of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ as being Al-Hafiz.""So exalted is Allah when you reach the evening and when you reach the morning. And to Him is [due all] praise throughout the heavens and the earth. And [exalted is He] at night and when you are at noon. He brings the living out of the dead and brings the dead out of the living and brings to life the earth after its lifelessness. And thus will you be brought out."" (Qur'an 30:17-19)The Perfect Balance:Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ has perfected the balance of the elements and instilled self-preservation within all creation. All things are instinctually guided. This is how birds know to migrate south for the winter, how bees can travel 12km away from the hive and find their way back, how salmons return to the same river bank they were born to lay their eggs despite having traveled hundreds to thousands of miles away in the vast ocean. It's jaw-dropping to consider how different elements that are at odds with one another (e.g., hot and cold, dryness and wetness) exist under our skin in the perfect balance because Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ has reconciled them to be that way. The human body is a powerful self-regulating system. If you look at the average body temperature in humans, it exists within a small range of 36.1 C - 37.2 C. The same is true of our blood pH level, hovering around 7.35 to 7.45. The slightest diversion from this range can have very harmful effects. Yet, within our body, the pH level of the acid in our stomach is 1.5-2.5. If this came in direct contact with your skin, it would burn a hole through your flesh. But Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ — great and glorious — made it so our stomach can safely house this acid for self-preservation to help eat and digest food. فَإِن تَوَلَّوۡاْ فَقَدۡ أَبۡلَغۡتُكُم مَّآ أُرۡسِلۡتُ بِهِۦٓ إِلَيۡكُمۡۚ وَيَسۡتَخۡلِفُ رَبِّي قَوۡمًا غَيۡرَكُمۡ وَلَا تَضُرُّونَهُۥ شَيۡـًٔاۚ إِنَّ رَبِّي عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيۡءٍ حَفِيظٞFa in tawallaw faqad ablaghtukum maaa ursiltu biheee ilaikum; wa yastakhlifu Rabbee qawman ghairakum wa laa tadur roonahoo shai'aa; inna Rabbee ‘alaa kulli shai'in HafeezEnglish Translation:But if they turn away, [say], 'I have already conveyed that with which I was sent to you. My Lord will give succession to a people other than you, and you will not harm Him at all. Indeed my Lord is, over all things, Guardian.'"" — (Qur'an 11:57) إِنَّا نَحْنُ نَزَّلْنَا ٱلذِّكْرَ وَإِنَّا لَهُۥ لَحَـٰفِظُونَInnaa Nahnu nazalnaz Zikra wa Innaa lahoo lahaa fizoonEnglish Translation:""Indeed, it is We who sent down the Qur'an and indeed, We will be its guardian."" — (Qur'an 15:9)Ayatul Kursi:You may be familiar with the idea of reciting Ayatul Kursi if you're afraid and want some kind of protection. But why else do we recite Ayatul kursi? What's special about this verse? In the tafsir of Abul Ala Maududi, ""A fundamental fact about war - that victory and success do not depend upon superiority in either numbers or weapons - was then indicated. They depend rather on faith, fortitude, discipline and firm resolution."" This is the idea that nothing can happen except by Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ permission. In moments of complete despair, when it looks like you can't win the battle because you're outnumbered - the one who can grant you victory, provide protection, and bring you comfort is Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. Believe in Him, praise Him, call upon His attributes, ""Ya Hafeedh, Ya Maani, Ya Qawwiy, Ya Aliyyul Azeem"" - ""O Guardian, O Preventer of Harm, O Strong One, O Most High, the Most Great"" and continue asking for whatever you wish, ""guide us, forgive us, grant us a safe passage."" قَالَ هَلۡ ءَامَنُكُمۡ عَلَيۡهِ إِلَّا كَمَآ أَمِنتُكُمۡ عَلَىٰٓ أَخِيهِ مِن قَبۡلُ فَٱللَّهُ خَيۡرٌ حَٰفِظٗاۖ وَهُوَ أَرۡحَمُ ٱلرَّـٰحِمِينَQaala hal aamanukum alaihi illaa kamaa amintukum alaaa akheehi min qabl; fal laahu khairun haafizanw wa Huwa arhamur RaahimeenEnglish Translation:""He said, 'Should I entrust you with him except [under coercion] as I entrusted you with his brother before? But Allah is the best guardian, and He is the most merciful of the merciful.'"" — (Qur'an 12:64)We can make du'a in any language, but another reason for reciting Ayatul Kursi is given in the hadith. narrated 'Abdullah bin Mas'ud: ""Allah has not created in the heavens nor in the earth what is more magnificent than Ayat Al-Kursi."" Sufyan said: ""Because Ayat Al-Kursi is the Speech of Allah, and Allah's Speech is greater than Allah's creation of the heavens and the earth."" [1] So, with this perspective let's review this magnificent verse. ٱللَّهُ  لَآ  إِلَٰهَ  إِلَّا  هُوَ  ٱلۡحَيُّ  ٱلۡقَيُّومُۚ  لَا  تَأۡخُذُهُۥ  سِنَةٞ  وَلَا  نَوۡمٞۚ  لَّهُۥ  مَا  فِي  ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ  وَمَا  فِي  ٱلۡأَرۡضِۗ  مَن  ذَا  ٱلَّذِي  يَشۡفَعُ  عِندَهُۥٓ  إِلَّا  بِإِذۡنِهِۦۚ  يَعۡلَمُ  مَا  بَيۡنَ  أَيۡدِيهِمۡ  وَمَا  خَلۡفَهُمۡۖ  وَلَا  يُحِيطُونَ  بِشَيۡءٖ  مِّنۡ  عِلۡمِهِۦٓ  إِلَّا  بِمَا  شَآءَۚ  وَسِعَ  كُرۡسِيُّهُ  ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ  وَٱلۡأَرۡضَۖ  وَلَا  يَـُٔودُهُۥ  حِفۡظُهُمَاۚ  وَهُوَ  ٱلۡعَلِيُّ  ٱلۡعَظِيمُAllahu laaa ilaaha illaa Huwal Haiyul Qaiyoom; laa taakhuzuhoo sinatunw wa laa nawm; lahoo maa fissamaawaati wa maa fil ard; man zal lazee yashfa'u indahooo illaa bi-iznih; ya'lamu maa baina aydeehim wa maa khalfahum wa laa yuheetoona bishai'im min ‘ilmihee illaa bimaa shaaa'; wasi'a Kursiyyuhus samaawaati wal arda wa laa Ya'ooduhoo hifzuhumaa; wa Huwal Aliyyul AzeemEnglish Translation:""Allah - there is no deity except Him, the Ever-Living, the Sustainer of [all] existence. Neither drowsiness overtakes Him nor sleep. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. Who is it that can intercede with Him except by His permission? He knows what is [presently] before them and what will be after them, and they encompass not a thing of His knowledge except for what He wills. His Kursi extends over the heavens and the earth, and their preservation tires Him not. And He is the Most High, the Most Great."" — (Qur'an 2:255)The verse does not explicitly state the name Al-Hafeedh but mentions Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ as being watchful over ""the heavens and the earth, and their preservation tires Him not."" which encompasses the same attribute as the name Al-Hafeedh. It also calls upon Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ by many names which we have covered up until this point. Can you identify them? [2]Reflection:Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ has provided the answers to things that threaten our existence and our harmony and taught us how to be protected from them. He sent this through His books and His teachers (i.e., the Prophets, may peace be upon them). He tells us to be cautious and avoid the poisons of gambling, alcohol, adultery, backbiting, envy, jealousy, and ignorance. He advocates for charity, lawful marriages, looking after your community, seeking knowledge, become intelligent and useful. He's not denied us enjoyment and complete detachment from all things. We're encouraged to enjoy what's permissible while keeping our duties and responsibilities.By studying the name Al-Hafeedh, it should inspire us to further rely upon Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. We should seek to mimic this attribute in small ways, to give our best effort to memorize the Qur'an and become a Hafiz. This is probably too big of a task, so break it down and be a ""preserver"" of a few small surahs. Narrated Abu Hurairah: The Prophet ﷺ said: ""The one who memorized the Qur'an shall come on the Day of Judgment and (the reward for reciting the Qur'an) says: 'O Lord! Decorate him."" So he is donned with a crown of nobility. Then it says: ""O Lord! Give him more!"" So he is donned with a suit of nobility. Then it says: ""O Lord! Be pleased with him.' So He is pleased with him and says: ""Recite and rise up, and be increased in reward with every Ayah."""" [3]We must also try to preserve our deen and our character from being corrupted by sin. The Shaitan will try to pull us in many directions. He will encourage us to get angry about small things, to let down over here, and to give in to some temptations over there. We must actively fight to preserve our faith. We should also seek to preserve things encouraged in Islam, kindness to one another, love among the community, and keeping the peace. The only justification for fighting is against oppression and tyranny.References:[1] Sahih (Darussalam) Jami at-Tirmidhi 2884[2] Five names: Allah, Al-Hayy, Al-Qayyum, Al-Aliyy, Al-Azeem.

المُقيِت,Al-Muqit / Al-Muqeet,The Nourisher,"The Nourisher, The Sustainer","Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Muqeet (in Arabic: ٱلْمُقِيتُ) meaning the ultimate sustainer. He gives strength and nourishment to His creations and maintains all that exists. He oversees, guards, and preserves all. To Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ we owe the satisfaction of all needs, but He is alone and independent of needs.","From the root qaf-waw-ta (ق و ت), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to feed, nourish, to supply, sustain, to keep, preserve, guard, to witness, observe, watch over.","Arabic Root:From the root qaf-waw-ta (ق و ت), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to feed, nourish, to supply, sustain, to keep, preserve, guard, to witness, observe, watch over.Physical v. Spiritual Needs:The name of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ, Al-Muqeet - The Nourisher. We all require sustenance and nourishment. At first, we require physical nourishment, food, and drink being the strongest of needs. Once that need is satiated, we often experience an inner void, and some mistakenly believe it can only be filled with material things. After all the hoarding and consuming, they will find this hole is a bottomless pit that can never be filled. The nourishment they need can only be found in the light of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. Through devotion to Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ and increasing their spiritual aspirations, they fill the missing piece. In this way, Al-Muqit is the spiritual nourisher.But Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ also has prescribed physical nourishment. Every person has it written for him/her what nourishment is available, and no one can come in the way of limiting what's been ordained. It was narrated from Jabir bin Abdullah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ""O people, fear Allah and be moderate in seeking a living, for no soul will die until it has received all its provision, even if it is slow in coming. So fear Allah and be moderate in seeking provision; take that which is permissible and leave that which is forbidden.""  [1] So in this sense, it's similar to the meaning of the name Ar-Razzaq (The Provider) but more emphasis on the spiritual aspect. Imam al-Ghazali writes, ""this name is more specific, since provision includes what is other than food as well as food."" As the name of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ it is only mentioned once in the Qur'an. مَّن يَشۡفَعۡ شَفَٰعَةً حَسَنَةٗ يَكُن لَّهُۥ نَصِيبٞ مِّنۡهَاۖ وَمَن يَشۡفَعۡ شَفَٰعَةٗ سَيِّئَةٗ يَكُن لَّهُۥ كِفۡلٞ مِّنۡهَاۗ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيۡءٖ مُّقِيتٗاMai yashfa shafaa'atan hasanatay yakul lahoo naseebum minhaa wa mai yashfa shafaa'atan saiyi'atany-yakul lahoo kiflum minhaa; wa kaanal laahu 'alaa kulli shai'im MuqeetaaEnglish Translation:""Whoever intercedes for a good cause will have a reward therefrom; and whoever intercedes for an evil cause will have a burden therefrom. And ever is Allah, over all things, a Keeper."" — (Qur'an 4:85)Because of this attribute of being the one who sustains all and provides for all, some will write Al-Muqit as being ""The Powerful."" But being the nourisher is a more accurate description. Below we include more Quranic verses that demonstrate the quality of this name rather than verses that reference this name. ۞وَمَا مِن دَآبَّةٖ فِي ٱلۡأَرۡضِ إِلَّا عَلَى ٱللَّهِ رِزۡقُهَا وَيَعۡلَمُ مُسۡتَقَرَّهَا وَمُسۡتَوۡدَعَهَاۚ كُلّٞ فِي كِتَٰبٖ مُّبِينٖWa maa min daaabbatin fil ardi illaa ‘alal laahi rizquhaa wa ya'lamu mustaqarrahaa wa mustawda'ahaa; kullun fee Kitaabim MubeenEnglish Translation:""And there is no creature on earth but that upon Allah is its provision, and He knows its place of dwelling and place of storage. All is in a clear register."" — (Qur'an 11:6) ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِي خَلَقَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلۡأَرۡضَ وَأَنزَلَ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مَآءٗ فَأَخۡرَجَ بِهِۦ مِنَ ٱلثَّمَرَٰتِ رِزۡقٗا لَّكُمۡۖ وَسَخَّرَ لَكُمُ ٱلۡفُلۡكَ لِتَجۡرِيَ فِي ٱلۡبَحۡرِ بِأَمۡرِهِۦۖ وَسَخَّرَ لَكُمُ ٱلۡأَنۡهَٰرَAllaahul lazee khalaqas samaawaati wal arda wa anzala minas samaaa'i maaa'an faakhraja bihee minas samaraati rizqal lakum wa sakhkhara lakumul fulka litajriya fil bahri bi amrihee wa sakhkhara lakumul anhaarEnglish Translation:""It is Allah who created the heavens and the earth and sent down rain from the sky and produced thereby some fruits as provision for you and subjected for you the ships to sail through the sea by His command and subjected for you the rivers."" — (Qur'an 14:32) قُلْ أَغَيْرَ ٱللَّهِ أَتَّخِذُ وَلِيًّۭا فَاطِرِ ٱلسَّمَـٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ وَهُوَ يُطْعِمُ وَلَا يُطْعَمُ ۗ قُلْ إِنِّىٓ أُمِرْتُ أَنْ أَكُونَ أَوَّلَ مَنْ أَسْلَمَ ۖ وَلَا تَكُونَنَّ مِنَ ٱلْمُشْرِكِينَQul aghairal laahi attakhizu waliyyan faatiris samaawaati wal ardi wa Huwa yut'imu wa laa yut'am; qul inneee umirtu an akoona awwala man aslama wa laa takoonanna minal mushrikeenEnglish Translation:""Say, “Is it other than Allah I should take as a protector, Creator of the heavens and the earth, while it is He who feeds and is not fed?” Say, [O Muhammad], “Indeed, I have been commanded to be the first [among you] who submit [to Allah] and [was commanded], ‘Do not ever be of the polytheists.'"" — (Qur'an 6:14)Reflection:We've explored in more detail how a believer benefits in understanding how Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is the giver of sustenance (see the name Ar-Razzaq). But a point worth reiterating is if you see that Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Muqit, then you realize the importance of sabr (patience). “And We will surely test you with something of fear and hunger and a loss of wealth and lives and fruits, but give good tidings to the patient…” (Qur'an 2:155)Go out in the world, be as deliberate as you can be, do your work, do what's required of you but leave the rest to Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. Nothing can happen without His will, and if you trust He is the nourisher, the provider, the all-wise, then you must not be hard on yourself. What has been written for you, you will receive. Resorting to unlawful measures will not increase your sustenance. The number is the number. How you will receive it is up to you. It may come at once in a large sum. For others, it may be a slow and steady race.Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger ﷺ as saying: O Allah, make the provision of Muhammad's family sufficient just to sustain life.

الْحسِيبُ,Al-Haseeb / Al-Hasib,The Reckoner,"The Reckoner, The Sufficient, The one who Suffices.","Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Haseeb (in Arabic: ٱلْحَسِيبُ). He is The One who takes account of all actions and reckons them on the day of judgment. There is nothing that goes unnoticed, however small. Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is the one who will take account of all and everything and will hold each person accountable. He will give whatever is sufficient and necessary in every situation.","From the root ha-sin-ba (ح س ب), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: To reckon, number, count, calculate, compute, think. To give without sparing or scanting, to give without the receiver’s expectation. To suffice, to be sufficient, or without measure.","Arabic Root:From the root ha-sin-ba (ح س ب), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: To reckon, number, count, calculate, compute, think. To give without sparing or scanting, to give without the receiver's expectation. To suffice, to be sufficient, or without measure.Al-Muqeet and Al-Haseeb:The previous name we discussed is Al-Muqeet which is closely related to Al-Haseeb. Al-Muqit is The Nourisher. He provides for our sustenance in a variety of ways - both material and spiritual. Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ has given each one of us a varying degree of intellectual ability as well as a certain amount of wealth and time to spend however we wish.Now, Hasib comes from hasaba, which means to count (past tense), calculate, or account. He is the one who measures and reckons. So, in a way, Al-Muqeet is the one who fills us with life, knowledge, and wealth, and Al-Haseeb is the one who is constantly measuring. He is checking to see whether these gifts are squandered or utilized. So, in the perpetual form, Al-Hasib is ""The Accountant,"" who watches every action and deed and will settle all accounts. ٱلَّذِينَ يُبَلِّغُونَ رِسَـٰلَـٰتِ ٱللَّهِ وَيَخْشَوْنَهُۥ وَلَا يَخْشَوْنَ أَحَدًا إِلَّا ٱللَّهَ ۗ وَكَفَىٰ بِٱللَّهِ حَسِيبًۭاAllazeena yuballighoona Risaalaatil laahi wa yakhshaw nahoo wa laa yakkhshawna ahadan illal laah; wa kafaa billaahi HaseebaaEnglish Translation:""[Allah praises] those who convey the messages of Allah and fear Him and do not fear anyone but Allah. And sufficient is Allah as Accountant."" — (Qur'an 33:39)Other Interpretations:Al-Haseeb is also understood to be a name of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ that demonstrates the attribute of His knowledge. He knows the result of every creation. Nothing surprises Him. On the day of reckoning, they will stand before Him bringing their accounts of whatever good they've accumulated. Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ does not need to perform any calculations. He knows the result. There is no inaccuracy or impreciseness in His judgment. He takes everything into account and does not miss any detail.Another meaning of Al-Hasib is sufficiency. He is sufficient, not needing anyone or anything. Nothing is truly self-sufficient besides Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. For if something was sufficient, it would not need anything for its existence. There is nothing but Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ that has this quality. But yet, a common desire is to be self-reliant but this term is often misused and misunderstood. What we really mean is we need Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ to take care of us and help us in our affairs. We are not be beholden to anyone or anything but Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. In Surah Talaq verse 3, ""And will provide for him from where he does not expect. And whoever relies upon Allah - then He is [hasbuh] sufficient for him.""Du'a of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ:The best example of this is when the Prophet ﷺ faced a loss in battle Uhud against Abu Sufyan. The army gathered and confronted the Prophet (may peace be upon him), and in an attempt to break their morale, ""Men said to them: 'A great army is gathering against you' And frightened them: But it (only) increased their Faith: They said: Hasbunallah wa ni'mal-Wakil ""For us Allah sufficeth, and He is the best disposer of affairs."" (Qur'an 3:173) وَنَضَعُ ٱلۡمَوَٰزِينَ ٱلۡقِسۡطَ لِيَوۡمِ ٱلۡقِيَٰمَةِ فَلَا تُظۡلَمُ نَفۡسٞ شَيۡـٔٗاۖ وَإِن كَانَ مِثۡقَالَ حَبَّةٖ مِّنۡ خَرۡدَلٍ أَتَيۡنَا بِهَاۗ وَكَفَىٰ بِنَا حَٰسِبِينَWa nada'ul mawaazeenal qista li Yawmil Qiyaamati falaa tuzlamu nafsun shai'aa; wa in kaana misqaala habbatim min khardalin atainaa bihaa; wa kafaa binaa haasibeenEnglish Translation:""And We place the scales of justice for the Day of Resurrection, so no soul will be treated unjustly at all. And if there is [even] the weight of a mustard seed, We will bring it forth. And sufficient are We as accountant."" — (Qur'an 21:47)Reflection:From this attribute of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ we can learn not to undermine any act of good. There is no deed too small. Any chance to do good should be taken with utmost urgency because, on the day of reckoning, we would wish to have a chance to replay those moments and do things differently. So this name reminds us not to waste a moment to do good and go the extra mile because most people won't. Be an extraordinary individual, always looking and observing to find a way to help people. Don't squander your time on earth as 'The Accountant' is watching how you spend the greatest capital of all, which is your time.Be courteous, and don't be afraid to be different. Run to the kitchen the next time someone says they are thirsty and see how weirdly they'll look at you. Another example the Qur'an teaches us is to greet the person who says salam with one that's better than it (i.e., Assalamualaikum being the base, Assalamualaikum Warahmatullah being one greater, and Assalamualaikum Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh being the greatest of them all). Imagine the strange looks if, in the English language, we did the same. Your friend says, ""Hey,"" and you respond, ""Hi, hope you're doing better than good and better than most, May Allah shower His peace and blessings upon you!""Now, in every interaction, you're given a chance to have that same effect, not just with being over the top with your words but with your presence, alertness, attention, and overall care for the other person. When someone really cares, we can feel it. It's an intuitive feeling and hard to fake. But it can be worked on and improved. What if this was your last conversation with that person? How would that change the dynamics of the way you approach the interaction? مَّن يَشۡفَعۡ شَفَٰعَةً حَسَنَةٗ يَكُن لَّهُۥ نَصِيبٞ مِّنۡهَاۖ وَمَن يَشۡفَعۡ شَفَٰعَةٗ سَيِّئَةٗ يَكُن لَّهُۥ كِفۡلٞ مِّنۡهَاۗ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيۡءٖ مُّقِيتٗا وَإِذَا حُيِّيتُم بِتَحِيَّةٖ فَحَيُّواْ بِأَحۡسَنَ مِنۡهَآ أَوۡ رُدُّوهَآۗ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيۡءٍ حَسِيبًاMai yashfa shafaa'atan hasanatay yakul lahoo naseebum minhaa wa mai yashfa shafaa'atan saiyi'atany-yakul lahoo kiflum minhaa; wa kaanal laahu alaa kulli shai'im Muqeetaa Wa izaa huyyeetum bitahaiyyatin fahaiyoo bi ahsana minhaaa aw ruddoohaa; innal laaha kaana alaa kulli shai'in HaseebaEnglish Translation:""Whoever intercedes for a good cause will have a reward therefrom; and whoever intercedes for an evil cause will have a burden therefrom. And ever is Allah, over all things, a Keeper. And when you are greeted with a greeting, greet [in return] with one better than it or [at least] return it [in a like manner]. Indeed, Allah is ever, over all things, an Accountant."" — (Qur'an 4:85-86)Ibn Mas'ud narrated that the Messenger of Allah SAW said: ""The feet of the son of Adam shall not move from before his Lord on the Day of Judgment, until he is asked about five things: About his life and what he did with it, about his youth and what he wore it out in, about his wealth and how he earned it, and spent it upon, and what he did with what he knew.""

الْجَلِيلُ,Al-Jalil / Al-Jaleel,The Majestic One,"The Glorious, The Majestic, The Sublime","Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Jaleel (in Arabic: ٱلْجَلِيلُ): He is the great one and above all in dignity and rank. He is majestic and the source of all attributes of greatness. To Him, all honor and sincere devotion are due.","From the root jim-lam-lam (ج ل ل), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be supremely great. To be glorious, majestic. To be sublime, to be high, lofty, far above, independent. The word Jalal (جلال) comes from the same root meaning greatness, majestic, and loftiness.","Arabic Root:From the root jim-lam-lam (ج ل ل), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be supremely great. To be glorious, majestic. To be sublime, to be high, lofty, far above, independent. The word Jalal (جلال) comes from the same root meaning greatness, majestic, and loftiness.Among the disputed names:As we've mentioned in previous names, different scholars have different criteria for what qualifies as a name of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. Of the 99 names, 81 are explicitly mentioned in the Qur'an. Therefore, there is not one agreed-upon list for the remaining 18 names. Al-Jalil is one of those names which is not included by certain scholars. This list includes Ibn al-Wazir, Ibn Hajar, and Ibn al-Uthaymeen. However, others, such as Ibn Arabi, Imam al-Bayhaqi, and Imam al-Ghazali, have included this name in their books of explanations of Asma ul-Husna. But many verses do describe this quality of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ as being Al-Jalil. وَيَبْقَىٰ وَجْهُ رَبِّكَ ذُو ٱلْجَلَـٰلِ وَٱلْإِكْرَامِWa yabqaa wajhu rabbika zul jalaali wal ikraamEnglish Translation:""And there will remain the Face of your Lord, Owner of Majesty and Honor."" — (Qur'an 55:27)What does it mean to be majestic?The All-Majestic is an attribute only Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ can attain. What does it mean to be absolutely majestic? It means you have complete knowledge, strength, sovereignty, wealth, power, and dominion, among all the other attributes. His majesty is unique and immeasurable. It bears no resemblance to anything past, present, or future. There are many names which denote Allah's سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ greatness. For example, Al-Jalil is 'The Majestic' because of the perfection of all His attributes/qualities. Al-Kabir (the great), whose very essence is to be perfect. Al-Azeem (the magnificent one) - the one described as tremendous because of His attributes. All the attributes which mention the greatness, majesty or transcendent nature of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ are called attributes of Jalal (majesty). The other attributes (i.e., mercy, kindness, care, provision, sustenance) are attributes of beauty (Jamal). It is said by scholars all of His names are either attributes of Jalal or Jamal. They are also interrelated, the majesty of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is His beauty, and His beauty is His majesty.When Allah revealed Himself to Musa (as): وَلَمَّا جَآءَ مُوسَىٰ لِمِيقَـٰتِنَا وَكَلَّمَهُۥ رَبُّهُۥ قَالَ رَبِّ أَرِنِىٓ أَنظُرْ إِلَيْكَ ۚ قَالَ لَن تَرَىٰنِى وَلَـٰكِنِ ٱنظُرْ إِلَى ٱلْجَبَلِ فَإِنِ ٱسْتَقَرَّ مَكَانَهُۥ فَسَوْفَ تَرَىٰنِى ۚ فَلَمَّا تَجَلَّىٰ رَبُّهُۥ لِلْجَبَلِ جَعَلَهُۥ دَكًّۭا وَخَرَّ مُوسَىٰ صَعِقًۭا ۚ فَلَمَّآ أَفَاقَ قَالَ سُبْحَـٰنَكَ تُبْتُ إِلَيْكَ وَأَنَا۠ أَوَّلُ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَWa lammaa jaaa'a Moosa limeeqaatinaa wa kallamahoo Rabbuhoo qaala Rabbi arineee anzur ilaik; qaala lan taraanee wa laakininzur ilal jabali fa inistaqarra makaanahoo fasawfa taraanee; falammaa tajallaa Rabbuhoo liljabali ja'alahoo dakkanw wa kharra Moosaa sa'iqaa; falammaaa afaaqa qaala Subhaanaka tubtu ilaika wa ana awwalul mu'mineenEnglish Translation:""And when Moses arrived at Our appointed time and his Lord spoke to him, he said, 'My Lord, show me [Yourself] that I may look at You.' [Allah] said, 'You will not see Me, but look at the mountain; if it should remain in place, then you will see Me.' But when his Lord appeared to the mountain, He rendered it level, and Moses fell unconscious. And when he awoke, he said, “Exalted are You! I have repented to You, and I am the first of the believers.'"" — (Qur'an 7:143)This ayah explains how Musa (as) asked to see Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. But Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ responded that no one could bear to see Him, warning Musa (as) of the danger. Instead, He made His presence to a nearby mountain. What followed was the decimation of that mountain. It was said the mountain was leveled or flattened, meaning it was transformed into a flat land or a small hill. In that split second, just being close to His presence, Musa (as) fainted.Reflection:The connection of this story with the name Al-Jalil is Allah's beauty and majesty can't be understood through sight. The way we metaphorically see Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is through the study and understanding of the attributes that make Him ""The All-Majestic."" Imam al-Ghazali writes of Allah's attributes, ""and that is beautiful comportment 'or' beautiful disposition' perceived by insight rather than by sight."" The one who understands how the inner has been perfected and properly proportioned will gain much more understanding and satisfaction than the one who judges beauty just by sight.In this hadith, we see where the attribute of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ as being called al-Jaleel originates, Mu'adh ibn Jabal narrated that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: ""Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, said: 'Those who love each other for the sake of My Majesty (جَلاَلِي) shall be upon podiums of light, and they will be admired by the Prophets and the martyrs.'"" [1]This also covers the important topic of loving for the sake of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. It's a message that encourages us never to stop searching for the good in humanity. To love your fellow person unconditionally because that's what Allah loves and will reward us for doing. Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger ﷺ as saying: Verily. Allah would say on the Day of Resurrection: Where are those who have a mutual love for My Glory's sake? Today I shall shelter them in My shadow when there is no other shadow but the shadow of Mine. [2]The believer further benefits from knowing and understanding Al-Jalil by trying to perfect his interior attributes. Doing so will bring more beauty and pleasure into this world than any superficial looks could bring. As Imam Ghazali writes, ""exterior beauty is of lesser worth.""References:[1] Sahih (Darussalam) Jami` at-Tirmidhi 2390[2] Sahih Muslim 2566"
الْكَرِيمُ,Al-Karim / Al-Kareem,The Most Generous,"The Generous One, The Gracious, The Bountiful.","Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Kareem (in Arabic: ٱلْكَرِيمُ) meaning the one who is the most generous, bountiful and esteemed. He is The One whose kindness knows no bounds and continually gives precious gifts to whomever He wills. He is gracious in giving and forgiving.","From the root kaf-ra-mim (ك ر م), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be noble, grand, high minded. To be generous, giving, beneficent, to be highly esteemed, honored, prized, valued, to be excellent, precious, valuable, rare, to be productive, fruitful.","Arabic Root:From the root kaf-ra-mim (ك ر م), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be noble, grand, high minded. To be generous, giving, beneficent, to be highly esteemed, honored, prized, valued, to be excellent, precious, valuable, rare, to be productive, fruitful.First Interpretation of the Name:The name Al-Kareem is understood to have two meanings. More commonly understood to be the one who is generous or bestows honor. But some scholars have said Al-Kareem also possesses the same quality of being all honorable or noble. This interpretation is supported by the idea that Karam (same root k-r-m) is used to describe something honored or respected. In the Qur'an, it says, ""Wa laqad karramnaa Baneee aadama,"" meaning, ""And We have certainly honored the children of Adam"" (Qur'an 17:70). This view also connects to the last name, Al-Jaleel (The Majestic). Al-Jaleel is the highest in rank, which makes Him Kareem - honored or highly esteemed.Second Interpretation of the Name:Similarly, in the hadith literature, you will read Kareem to be translated as being noble. Abu Hurayra reported the Messenger of Allah ﷺ as saying: إِنَّ الْكَرِيمَ ابْنَ الْكَرِيمِ ابْنِ الْكَرِيمِ ابْنِ الْكَرِيمِ يُوسُفُ بْنُ يَعْقُوبَ بْنِ إِسْحَاقَ بْنِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ, ""The noble son of the noble son of the noble son of the noble one was Yusuf ibn Ya'qub ibn Ishaq ibn Ibrahim."" [1] Note the repetition of the Arabic (ابْنِ الْكَرِيمِ), Ibn Kareem, as being translated as ""The Noble Son."" So together, we have the definition of being esteemed, noble, and honored. To have this reputation, to be called by these names indicates that you must have some virtuous qualities that have been perfected.Another example, Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ in Surah Waqi'ah verse 77 says, Innahoo la quraanun kareem which translates to, ""Indeed, it is a noble Qur'an."" The connotation of Kareem being kind doesn't apply here because it's not clear what it means for a book to be gracious or generous. Instead, as the translation reflects, being a book of nobility does, meaning a book perfected in all its attributes.Now, moving towards the more understood meaning of this name. Kareem refers to kindness or generosity. His greatest gift to mankind is His mercy. We show a lapse in judgment whenever we err and should be held accountable for our actions. But Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is the generous one and has choosen to forgive. His mercy supersedes His wrath. He is also generous in His promise. The reward for the doer of good deeds far exceeds the effort of the action. It is not a one-to-one transaction. The reward that is with Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ far exceeds any imaginable notion of what's promised. يَـٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلْإِنسَـٰنُ مَا غَرَّكَ بِرَبِّكَ ٱلْكَرِيمِYaaa ayyuhal insaaanu maa gharraka bi Rabbikal kareemEnglish Translation:""O mankind, what has deceived you concerning your Lord, the Generous,"" — (Qur'an 82:6) قَالَ ٱلَّذِي عِندَهُۥ عِلۡمٞ مِّنَ ٱلۡكِتَٰبِ أَنَا۠ ءَاتِيكَ بِهِۦ قَبۡلَ أَن يَرۡتَدَّ إِلَيۡكَ طَرۡفُكَۚ فَلَمَّا رَءَاهُ مُسۡتَقِرًّا عِندَهُۥ قَالَ هَٰذَا مِن فَضۡلِ رَبِّي لِيَبۡلُوَنِيٓ ءَأَشۡكُرُ أَمۡ أَكۡفُرُۖ وَمَن شَكَرَ فَإِنَّمَا يَشۡكُرُ لِنَفۡسِهِۦۖ وَمَن كَفَرَ فَإِنَّ رَبِّي غَنِيّٞ كَرِيمٞQaalal lazee indahoo ‘ilmum minal Kitaabi ana aateeka bihee qabla ai yartadda ilaika tarfuk; falammaa ra aahu mustaqirran ‘indahoo qaala haazaa min fadli Rabbee li yabluwaneee ‘a-ashkuru am akfuru wa man shakara fa innamaa yashkuru linafsihee wa man kafara fa inna Rabbee Ghaniyyun KareemEnglish Translation:""Said one who had knowledge from the Scripture, 'I will bring it to you before your glance returns to you.' And when [Solomon] saw it placed before him, he said, 'This is from the favor of my Lord to test me whether I will be grateful or ungrateful. And whoever is grateful - his gratitude is only for [the benefit of] himself. And whoever is ungrateful - then indeed, my Lord is Free of need and Generous.'"" — (Qur'an 27:40) ٱقْرَأْ وَرَبُّكَ ٱلْأَكْرَمُ ٱلَّذِى عَلَّمَ بِٱلْقَلَمِ عَلَّمَ ٱلْإِنسَـٰنَ مَا لَمْ يَعْلَمْIqra wa rab bukal akram Al lazee ‘allama bil qalam ‘Al lamal insaana ma lam y'alamEnglish Translation:""Recite, and your Lord is the most Generous - Who taught by the pen - Taught man that which he knew not."" — (Qur'an 96:3-5)On the virtue of education:Here Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ refers to Himself as being Al-Akram or the most generous. The following verses speak to how He taught us all we know with a pen (i.e., through His book). This highlights the noblest attributes Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ has gifted mankind. It's distinguished us from all other creations and has given us success as a species. Without this ability to learn from the pen, we would remain stagnant unable to transmit knowledge from one generation to the next.This brings weight to the saying that the pen is mightier than the sword. If we recognize this, being educated is just about one of the most dangerous pursuits. It's one of the greatest skills, the ability to learn, read, and acquire knowledge because, from that, we can pick up any other skill. This is one of the many gifts Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ has given humanity, hence the perfect pairing with the name Al-Kareem. The ability to learn and know is the process that lifts us from ignorance. It's process which we come to know who Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. It orients and directs all who would take the time to read.Some of His Generosity Enumerated:Just as He is generous, He is also gracious, meaning kind and merciful. An example of His mercy, Allah has written down the good deeds and the bad ones. Then He explained it [by saying that] he who has intended a good deed and has not done it, Allah writes it down with Himself as a full good deed, but if he has intended it and has done it, Allah writes it down with Himself as from ten good deeds to seven hundred times or many times over. But if he has intended a bad deed and has not done it, Allah writes it down with Himself as a full good deed, but if he has intended it and has done it, Allah writes it down as one bad deed.[2]And in the Qur'an, it says He will give a ""noble reward,"" meaning a multiplicative reward to those who give from their wealth to help those less fortunate. إِنَّ ٱلۡمُصَّدِّقِينَ وَٱلۡمُصَّدِّقَٰتِ وَأَقۡرَضُواْ ٱللَّهَ قَرۡضًا حَسَنٗا يُضَٰعَفُ لَهُمۡ وَلَهُمۡ أَجۡرٞ كَرِيمٞInnal mussaddiqeena wal mussaddiqaati wa aqradul laaha qardan hassanany yudaa'afu lahum wa lahum ajrun kareemEnglish Translation:""Indeed, the men who practice charity and the women who practice charity and [they who] have loaned Allah a goodly loan - it will be multiplied for them, and they will have a noble reward."" — (Qur'an 57:18)The scholars often list many other ways His generosity shines through. We enumerate some of the ways here:He loves to give. Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ loves when His servant turns to Him to ask for something. And when He gives, He gives without any reluctance or measure.He gives without asking and gives to whomever. We only see a few of these gifts as we've likely taken many of them for granted: our sight, intellect, health, friends, family, food, etc. It's often quoted, ""A healthy man wants a thousand things, a sick man only wants one.""He gives more than one can imagine. Out of all the blessings in your life, how many did you explicitly ask for?No discrimination. He gives to sinners and non-believers as well. He grants them the chance to see and accept the truth, ""And whoever disbelieves - I will grant him enjoyment for a little; then I will force him to the punishment of the Fire, and wretched is the destination."" (2:126)Fulfills all promises and never turns His back on a supplicant. He does not reject an asker. Narrated Salman al-Farsi: The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Your Lord is munificent and generous, and is ashamed to turn away empty the hands of His servant when he raises them to Him. [3]He gives even to those He knows who are insincere. ""And when affliction touches man, he calls upon Us, whether lying on his side or sitting or standing; but when We remove from him his affliction, he continues [in disobedience] as if he had never called upon Us to [remove] an affliction that touched him. Thus is made pleasing to the transgressors that which they have been doing"" (10:12)Reflection:A believer benefits from knowing that Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Kareem. We recognize that our Lord is generous, bountiful, and kind. We can try our best to mimic some of the ways Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ has been generous with us. For example, to find joy in giving. We may know someone or may have felt this way before, but when they give, they do so reluctantly. There's an art to giving that needs to be mastered.Imagine a scenario where you're getting a free shoe shine at the mall. You look down at the shoe and see the young boy just gave you one of the all-time greatest shines. And so now you decide to tip him. You look in your wallet and see a $1.00 coin or $5.00 bill. Which do you give? You feel a bit reluctant to pay $5.00 for a 5 minutes shine. As a personal rule, if two amounts cross your mind, go for the higher amount. Why? It will make all the difference in the world. If you give the boy $1.00, you start feeling bad. Every time you put on the shoes and recognize the shine, you'll say to yourself, I must be cheap. You don't want to go through the whole day with that on your mind.Another way to try and to be generous is if you know someone who is in need, offer a helping hand and save them the dignity of asking. If you know of their financial situation, throw a lifeline before the storm ravages through. Try and offer help before the pain necessitates them to seek help.We can also try to perfect our inner qualities to gain a reputation on earth as being noble. This includes working on perfecting attributes of graciousness, kindness, courage, intelligence, compassion, and communication. These are all skills that can be acquired but require a commitment to a lifelong journey of being a student studying, searching, and analyzing. As Imam al-Ghazali points out, it is good to recognize that these qualities may characterize us. Yet, we remain deficient by comparison with the one who is the superlative form, absolutely generous, all-wise, the oft-forgiving.References:[1] Sahih (Al-Albani) Al-Adab Al-Mufrad 896[2] Hadith #16, 40 Hadith Qudsi (As it was related in Sahih al-Bukhari 6491 and Sahih Muslim 131a)[3] Sahih (Al-Albani) Sunan Abi Dawud 1488"
الرَّقِيبُ,Ar-Raqib,The All Watchful,"The Watcher, The Observer.","Allah is Ar-Raqib (in Arabic ٱلْرَّقِيبُ), meaning the one who sees what's hidden.

The first is obvious, He sees the deeds of all His servants. Nothing is hidden from His sight. Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is well-aware of the details of every matter. Armed with this knowledge, we should be aware of ourselves, our actions, and our motives. It should inspire us to do what's right in all instances. To work diligently serving Allah's cause and seeking His approval. A constant reminder of Allah's ever-watchful nature. Living with this name at the forefront of our minds should make it easier to mitigate the evil temptations of shaitan and our ego - the two biggest enemies we face. However, this definition is just one of two and more befitting of the name Ash-Shaheed, meaning ""The Observing Witness."" يَـٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّاسُ ٱتَّقُواْ رَبَّكُمُ ٱلَّذِي خَلَقَكُم مِّن نَّفۡسٖ وَٰحِدَةٖ وَخَلَقَ مِنۡهَا زَوۡجَهَا وَبَثَّ مِنۡهُمَا رِجَالٗا كَثِيرٗا وَنِسَآءٗۚ وَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ ٱلَّذِي تَسَآءَلُونَ بِهِۦ وَٱلۡأَرۡحَامَۚ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ عَلَيۡكُمۡ رَقِيبٗاYaaa aiyuhan naasut taqoo Rabbakumul lazee khalaqakum min nafsinw waahidatinw wa khalaqa minhaa zawjahaa wa bas sa minhumaa rijaalan kaseeranw wa nisaaa'aa; wattaqul laahallazee tasaaa ‘aloona bihee wal arhaam; innal laaha kaana ‘alaikum RaqeebaEnglish Translation:""O mankind, fear your Lord, who created you from one soul and created from it its mate and dispersed from both of them many men and women. And fear Allah, through whom you ask one another, and the wombs. Indeed Allah is ever, over you, an Observer."" — (Qur'an 4:1)A neglected meaning:A more accurate description of Ar-Raqib refers to his nature of being ""watchful,"" not in the sense of scrutiny or judgment but just as a parent or guardian would be watchful over their child with love and care. He has not created us aimlessly to wander and become preoccupied elsewhere. Imam al-Ghazali says of Ar-Raqeeb, ""is one who knows and protects."" If we were aware of the constant surveillance or permanence of His gaze, we should feel safe and secure. But also, like a parent watching over a child, we should be very cautious to avoid approaching things that have been forbidden.The Castle of Al-Marqab:In Northern Syria, there is a castle called ""Qalaat al-Marqab,"" which translates to ""Castle of the Watchtower."" This castle was strategically built 1,180 ft above sea level to overlook the Mediterranean Sea. The word Marqab shares the same Arabic root, r-q-b. A Marqab refers to something tall, high above, and looked down upon. In this case, the castle is a high vantage point to protect from potential intruders or attacks. مَا قُلۡتُ لَهُمۡ إِلَّا مَآ أَمَرۡتَنِي بِهِۦٓ أَنِ ٱعۡبُدُواْ ٱللَّهَ رَبِّي وَرَبَّكُمۡۚ وَكُنتُ عَلَيۡهِمۡ شَهِيدٗا مَّا دُمۡتُ فِيهِمۡۖ فَلَمَّا تَوَفَّيۡتَنِي كُنتَ أَنتَ ٱلرَّقِيبَ عَلَيۡهِمۡۚ وَأَنتَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيۡءٖ شَهِيدٌMaa qultu lahum illaa maaa amartanee bihee ani'budul laaha Rabbeee wa Rabbakum; wa kuntu alaihim shaheedam maa dumtu feehim falammaa tawaffaitanee kunta Antar Raqeeba alaihim; wa Anta ‘alaa kulli shai'in ShaheedEnglish Translation:""Never did I say to them aught except what You (Allah) did command me to say: ‘Worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord.' And I was a witness over them while I dwelt amongst them, but when You took me up, You were the Watcher over them, and You are a Witness to all things."" — (Qur'an 5:117)The lesson from Prophet Isa (as):In this verse above, Jesus or Isa (as) describes how he was a witness to the people while he was among them. But when he was brought up from Earth to Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ there was no one to watch over His flock except Allah. Analogous to a shepherd, Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ provides food, drink, and shelter. He is the one who protects us from the harm of many dangers we're not even aware of. In the next verse, ""If You should punish them - indeed they are Your servants; but if You forgive them - indeed it is You who is the Exalted in Might, the Wise."" (Qur'an 5:118) Sometimes sheep will go astray, but Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ provides the signs to be guided back to the straight path. He has all the power and every right to punish, He is the shepherd or master, and we are the sheep, yet Isa (as) says, ""but if You forgive them - indeed it is You who is the Exalted in Might, the Wise."" Our misbehaving does not affect Him as He is ""Exalted in Might."" His forgiveness is not a sign of weakness but a mark of His intelligence and wisdom.Reflection:In one hadith, it describes how the companions gathered around the Prophet ﷺ and asked questions about Al-Imaan, Al-Islam, and Al-Ihsan. In the hadith, they discussed the obligations of Al-Imaan and affirmed Al-Qadr (the divine decree of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ). It is quite a long hadith, but at one point, it was asked of Prophet ﷺ ""Inform me about al-Ihsan (perfection or performance of good deeds). He ﷺ said: That you worship Allah as if you are seeing Him, for though you don't see Him, He, verily, sees you. [1]A common thread that runs through each name requires us to look inward. The believer benefits from this self-monitoring, not just from doing immoral acts but asking if they are living up to their potential. Are they using their time in a manner that Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ would be pleased to see? By truly embracing this perspective, a person can become more aware of how they dispense with their time. A person looks to see how they can be more productive and contribute to the well-being of their community, family, or friends. However, we must learn to balance, to not live with guilt to take time to enjoy the many blessings Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ has provided for us as well. In Surah Ar-Rahman verse 13, ""So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny?""Imam al-Ghazali also warns, ""knowing that his own soul is an enemy to him, and that Satan is his enemy; and that both of them take the opportunity to prompt him to forgetfulness and disobedience."" This is similar to the famous African proverb, ""if there is no enemy within, the enemy outside can do us no harm."" Suppose we learn to understand the root of our desires, fears, and insecurities. In that case, we can neutralize the destructive ways they manifest. If we are watchful over ourselves, we can protect ourselves from many shortcomings.References:[1] Sahih Muslim 8a & Sahih al-Bukhari 50"
ٱلْمُجِيبُ,al-Mujib / al-Mujeeb,The Responsive One,"The Responsive, The Answerer of Prayers, The Hearkener.","Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Mujeeb/Al-Mujib (in Arabic: ٱلْمُجِيبُ) meaning He is the one very close to His believers and readily available to hear and answer the supplications of those who ask. He is the responder to all needs, invitations, and prayers. Whoever needs help in difficulties, they should call upon this name of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ.","From the root jim-waw-ba (ج و ب), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to answer, reply, respond, accept to cut, pierce, penetrate, to have a dialog or conference, to comply with a desire when invited to do so.","Arabic Root:From the root jim-waw-ba (ج و ب), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to answer, reply, respond, accept to cut, pierce, penetrate, to have a dialog or conference, to comply with a desire when invited to do so.Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is close to you:Al-Mujeeb (The Responder) is mentioned in the Qur'an once and is beautifully paired with Al-Qareeb (The Close One). It's because Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is near to us, He responds. Nearness does not have to mean in a literal physical sense. For example, if I asked who is closest to you, would you look to your immediate right? No, you would likely respond with your spouse, a parent, a sibling, or a childhood friend. This person is close to you because they know you on a level most don't. They can be trusted and genuinely care for you and accept you. Similarly, Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Qareeb (near), and He is Al-Mujeeb (The Responsive). ۞وَإِلَىٰ ثَمُودَ أَخَاهُمۡ صَٰلِحٗاۚ قَالَ يَٰقَوۡمِ ٱعۡبُدُواْ ٱللَّهَ مَا لَكُم مِّنۡ إِلَٰهٍ غَيۡرُهُۥۖ هُوَ أَنشَأَكُم مِّنَ ٱلۡأَرۡضِ وَٱسۡتَعۡمَرَكُمۡ فِيهَا فَٱسۡتَغۡفِرُوهُ ثُمَّ تُوبُوٓاْ إِلَيۡهِۚ إِنَّ رَبِّي قَرِيبٞ مُّجِيبٞWa ilaa Samooda akhaahum Saalihaa; qaala yaa qawmi budul laaha maa lakum min ilaahim ghairuhoo Huwa ansha akum minal ardi wasta' marakum feehaa fastaghfiroohu summa toobooo ilaih; inna Rabbee Qareebum MujeebEnglish Translation:""And to Thamud [We sent] their brother Salih. He said, “O my people, worship Allah; you have no deity other than Him. He has produced you from the earth and settled you in it, so ask forgiveness of Him and then repent to Him. Indeed, my Lord is near and responsive."" — (Qur'an 11:61)Although these next few verses don't mention the name al-Mujeeb directly, they further emphasize this quality of being responsive. وَقَالَ رَبُّكُمُ ٱدۡعُونِيٓ أَسۡتَجِبۡ لَكُمۡۚ إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يَسۡتَكۡبِرُونَ عَنۡ عِبَادَتِي سَيَدۡخُلُونَ جَهَنَّمَ دَاخِرِينَWa qaala Rabbukumud ooneee astajib lakum; innal lazeena yastakbiroona an ibaadatee sa yadkhuloona jahannama daakhireen (Section 6)English Translation:""And your Lord says, “Call upon Me; I will respond to you.” Indeed, those who disdain My worship will enter Hell [rendered] contemptible."" — (Qur'an 40:60) وَإِذَا  سَأَلَكَ  عِبَادِي  عَنِّي  فَإِنِّي  قَرِيبٌۖ  أُجِيبُ  دَعۡوَةَ  ٱلدَّاعِ  إِذَا  دَعَانِۖ  فَلۡيَسۡتَجِيبُواْ  لِي  وَلۡيُؤۡمِنُواْ  بِي  لَعَلَّهُمۡ  يَرۡشُدُونَWa izaa sa alaka ‘ibaadee ‘annnee fa innee qareebun ujeebu da'wataddaa'i izaa da'aani falyastajeeboo lee wal yu'minoo bee la'allahum yarshudoonEnglish Translation:""And when My servants ask you, [O Muhammad], concerning Me - indeed I am near. I respond to the invocation of the supplicant when he calls upon Me. So let them respond to Me [by obedience] and believe in Me that they may be [rightly] guided."" — (Qur'an 2:186)And from the hadith, it was narrated by Anas: ""The Prophet ﷺ said, ""My Lord says, 'If My slave comes nearer to me for a span, I go nearer to him for a cubit; and if he comes nearer to Me for a cubit, I go nearer to him for the span of outstretched arms; and if he comes to Me walking, I go to him running.'"" [1]Addressing the concern of du'a not being responded to:The Prophets in Islam (may peace be upon them) were regular people like you and me, except we held them to a higher standard as they were impeccable in character. Despite their respected status in Islam, they suffered and endured a lot. Contrast this with when we make du'a, and it's not immediately fulfilled. We may grow impatient or falsely accept that we're not on good terms with our creator or that we're being punished. Yet in the Qur'an, we are told Prophet Nuh (as) made du'as asking for the protection of his wife and son, yet when the tide came, it drowned his family because they were of the deniers (see 11:42-42) Prophet Yusuf (as) was an innocent child. Do you think he deserved to be thrown into a well by his own brothers and left to die? Prophet Yaqub (as), the father of Yusuf (as), was deeply hurt by the loss of his child. Don't you think he prayed to Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ every day, asking for the safe return of his child? Allah tells us ""give good tidings to the patient"" (Qur'an 2:155). We know Yaqub (as) du'a was answered as he was reunited with his son. However, this was only after decades of so-called ""unanswered prayers.""Reflection:In learning the attributes of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ we come to understand whatever Allah does, He does good. We may see the challenges we're currently facing as difficult. Still, there is a reward for going through the pain and struggle and remembering Allah through it all. The bigger the hill, the better the reward. And each hill trekked and conquered brings one step closer to Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. If we recognize this, whatever obstacle is placed on that path, we will find a way to overcome it. This is similar to how a farmer must be patient to get his crop. He has to labor away many hours working under the hot, dry sun. He has to care for and nurture his garden to eventually reap the reward of his crops. No one said attaining the goal would be easy. But if we change our definition of what easy means to something you can do, then it's easy, ""Allah does not charge a soul except [with that within] its capacity. It will have [the consequence of] what [good] it has gained, and it will bear [the consequence of] what [evil] it has earned."" (Qur'an 2:286). We trust Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ knows what's best for us as we keep relentlessly marching forward. We turn to Allah, asking for His approval and seeking His guidance, ""If Allah should aid you, no one can overcome you; but if He should forsake you, who is there that can aid you after Him? And upon Allah let the believers rely."" (Qur'an 3:160)Abu Hurairah narrated that: The Prophet said: ""One of you will be responded to, so long as he is not hasty, saying: 'I supplicated, and I was not responded to.' [2] Be persistent and do not lose hope. One of the beneficial remedies is persisting in your du'a. Umar Ibn Khattab (ra) said: ""I do not concern myself with the response, but I concern myself with making supplication, for I know that the response will come with it!""The believer further benefits from knowing Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Mujeeb. Just as Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is responsive to us, we should be responsive to Him. He has asked us to uphold many values, i.e., of kinship, salah, spreading peace, helping the community, and keeping the sawm (fast). The Qur'an tells us (if we're capable) to respond to the ones who ask for help, ""and do not chide the one who asks for help;"" (Qur'an 93:10). The Prophet ﷺ also never denied an invitation of a person who wanted to help Him even if it seemed unappealing or in this case unappetizing, ""Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet ﷺ said, ""I shall accept the invitation even if I were invited to a meal of a sheep's trotter [feet of sheep], and I shall accept the gift even if it was an arm or a trotter of a sheep.""

الْوَاسِعُ,Al-Wasi,The All-Encompassing,"The Vast, The All-Embracing, The Boundless.","Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Wasi (in Arabic: ٱلْوَاسِعُ): The one who's knowledge, mercy, and provision are vast. He is of limitless capacity and abundance and gives without expecting anything in return. Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ embraces all things and His wisdom and mercy are boundless.","From the root waw-sin-ayn (و س ع), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be sufficient in capacity or size, wide, spacious to be ample, plentiful, bountiful, rich to comprehend, embrace, include, take in, pervade, limitless capacity, and abundance.","Arabic Root:From the root waw-sin-ayn (و س ع), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be sufficient in capacity or size, wide, spacious to be ample, plentiful, bountiful, rich to comprehend, embrace, include, take in, pervade, limitless capacity, and abundance.His Omnipresence:The name Al-Wasi has been mentioned nine times in the Qur'an and has a variety of meanings that we will uncover. The first refers to His vastness. Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is everywhere. Wherever you may be, He is with you. His vastness encompasses the entirety of the universe. He is not limited or bounded to one geographic location. He listens and responds to all who ask of Him because of the attribute of being Al-Wasi. وَلِلَّهِ  ٱلۡمَشۡرِقُ  وَٱلۡمَغۡرِبُۚ  فَأَيۡنَمَا  تُوَلُّواْ  فَثَمَّ  وَجۡهُ  ٱللَّهِۚ  إِنَّ  ٱللَّهَ  وَٰسِعٌ  عَلِيمٞWa lillaahil mashriqu walmaghrib; fa aynamaa tuwalloo fasamma wajhullaah; innal laaha waasi'un AleemEnglish Translation:""And to Allah belongs the east and the west. So wherever you [might] turn, there is the Face of Allah. Indeed, Allah is all-Encompassing and Knowing."" — (Qur'an 2:115)His Mercy:Another aspect of this name refers to the vastness of Allah's mercy encompasses. His mercy, knowledge, and power are infinite. It is the work of shaitan to make you believe that your plea for forgiveness will be rejected. The Qur'an and hadith affirm that our Lord is merciful. We may have done terrible things in the past. We may have repeated the same mistake to the point where it seems unredeemable. But how can we deny ourselves the mercy of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ when He says: ٱلشَّيۡطَٰنُ  يَعِدُكُمُ  ٱلۡفَقۡرَ  وَيَأۡمُرُكُم  بِٱلۡفَحۡشَآءِۖ  وَٱللَّهُ  يَعِدُكُم  مَّغۡفِرَةٗ  مِّنۡهُ  وَفَضۡلٗاۗ  وَٱللَّهُ  وَٰسِعٌ  عَلِيمٞAsh Shaitaanu ya'idukumul faqra wa ya'murukum bilfahshaaa'i wallaahu ya'idukum maghfiratam minhu wa fadlaa; wallaahu Waasi'un 'AleemEnglish Translation:""Satan threatens you with poverty and orders you to immorality, while Allah promises you forgiveness from Him and bounty. And Allah is all-Encompassing and Knowing."" — (Qur'an 2:268)On the authority of Anas (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say: Allah the Almighty said: O son of Adam, so long as you call upon Me and ask of Me, I shall forgive you for what you have done, and I shall not mind. O son of Adam, were your sins to reach the clouds of the sky and you were then to ask forgiveness of Me, I would forgive you. O son of Adam, were you to come to Me with sins nearly as great as the earth and were you then to face Me, ascribing no partner to Me, I would bring you forgiveness nearly as great as it. It was related by at-Tirmidhi (also by Ahmad ibn Hanbal). Its chain of authorities is sound.[1] ۞قُلۡ يَٰعِبَادِيَ ٱلَّذِينَ أَسۡرَفُواْ عَلَىٰٓ أَنفُسِهِمۡ لَا تَقۡنَطُواْ مِن رَّحۡمَةِ ٱللَّهِۚ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَغۡفِرُ ٱلذُّنُوبَ جَمِيعًاۚ إِنَّهُۥ هُوَ ٱلۡغَفُورُ ٱلرَّحِيمُQul yaa'ibaadiyal lazeena asrafoo 'alaaa anfusihim laa taqnatoo mirrahmatil laah; innal laaha yaghfiruz zunooba jamee'aa; innahoo Huwal Ghafoorur RaheemEnglish Translation:""Say, 'O My servants who have transgressed against themselves [by sinning], do not despair of the mercy of Allah. Indeed, Allah forgives all sins. Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiving, the Merciful.'"" — (Qur'an 39:53)Al-Wasi in divorce: وَإِن يَتَفَرَّقَا يُغۡنِ ٱللَّهُ كُلّٗا مِّن سَعَتِهِۦۚ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ وَٰسِعًا حَكِيمٗاWa iny-yatafarraqaa yughnil laahu kullam min sa'atih; wa kaanal laahu Waasi'an HakeemaaEnglish Translation:""But if they separate [by divorce], Allah will enrich each [of them] from His abundance. And ever is Allah Encompassing and Wise."" — (Qur'an 4:130)Another connotation we can infer from this ayah is Allah is Al-Wasi, the one whose provision is all-encompassing. In extenuating circumstances, divorce happens, and when it does, Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ reassures that both parties should not fear scarcity, clawing to one-up each other. Reconciliation and protecting the sanctity of marriage should be the priority, but if that ship has presumably sailed, then seek fairness as Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ will enrich both from His abundance. وَلَا تُؤۡمِنُوٓاْ إِلَّا لِمَن تَبِعَ دِينَكُمۡ قُلۡ إِنَّ ٱلۡهُدَىٰ هُدَى ٱللَّهِ أَن يُؤۡتَىٰٓ أَحَدٞ مِّثۡلَ مَآ أُوتِيتُمۡ أَوۡ يُحَآجُّوكُمۡ عِندَ رَبِّكُمۡۗ قُلۡ إِنَّ ٱلۡفَضۡلَ بِيَدِ ٱللَّهِ يُؤۡتِيهِ مَن يَشَآءُۗ وَٱللَّهُ وَٰسِعٌ عَلِيمٞWa laa tu'minooo illaa liman tabi'a deenakum qul innal hudaa hudal laahi ai yu'taaa ahadum misla maaa ooteetum aw yuhaaajjookum inda Rabbikum, qul innal fadla biyadil laah; yu'teehi mai yashaaa; wallaahu Waasi'un 'AleemEnglish Translation:""And do not trust except those who follow your religion.” Say, “Indeed, the [true] guidance is the guidance of Allah. [Do you fear] lest someone be given [knowledge] like you were given or that they would [thereby] argue with you before your Lord?” Say, “Indeed, [all] bounty is in the hand of Allah - He grants it to whom He wills. And Allah is all-Encompassing and Wise."" — (Qur'an 3:73)Reflection:Among these verses where Al-Wasi is mentioned, you see the pairing of names with the all-merciful, the all-knowing, and the all-wise. This name furthers the perfection of all His attributes. They are all-encompassing and have no extent to which they can be depleted or diminished. Imam Ghazali writes, ""His knowledge be considered, the sea of things He knows has no shore; in fact the seas would be exhausted if they were ink for His words.""The believer benefits from knowing Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Wasi in that they understand their Lord loves them. His mercy extends to all and knows no boundaries. It is all-encompassing and vast. This should bring great relief to the one who turns to Him, often asking for His forgiveness. It was narrated from Aisha (ra) that she said: ""Praise be to Allah Whose hearing encompasses all voices.[2] We also must look within ourselves; we are constrained and limited in many ways. Our intellect has boundaries, and our physical body has constraints, but can we say honestly we've stretched to see what's possible? Are we living close to these limits? Probably not. We are all likely to be living well beneath the potential Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ has made us capable of. We have a lot to offer and a lot to learn. Our connection to this name is through the expansion of our knowledge, our deen, and our character.References:[1] Hadith #34, 40 Hadith Qudsi[2] Sahih (Darussalam) Sunan an-Nasa'i 3460"
الْحَكِيمُ,Al-Hakim / Al-Hakeem,The All-Wise,"The Wise, The Judge of Judges, The One who is correct in His doings.","Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Hakeem (in Arabic: ٱلْحَكِيمُ), the most judicious and the all-wise. He possesses the ability to determine right from wrong and is free from error and misunderstanding. His designs in nature and life are perfect and accurate. He is the only one qualified to judge the worth of all things.","From the root ha-kaf-mim (ح ك م), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to prevent or restrain from wrongdoing or corruption, to turn someone back from wrongdoing or ignorance, to be wise, knowing the true nature of things, to pass judgment, to decide, pass a verdict.","Arabic Root:From the root ha-kaf-mim (ح ك م), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to prevent or restrain from wrongdoing or corruption, to turn someone back from wrongdoing or ignorance, to be wise, knowing the true nature of things, to pass judgment, to decide, pass a verdict.Al-Hakeem shares the same root h-k-m, with a closely related name we've already covered, Al-Hakam meaning ""The Judge."" Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is referred to as the all-wise for a total of 93 times in the Qur'an and the judge six times.This name is often used in pairs with the name Al-Alim (""The All-Knowing""). You can read about Al-Alim, which covers what it means to be The All-Knowledgable, and see how it connects with The All-Wise. Understanding this pairing helps us to see how Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ knowledge permeates every aspect of our lives. Everything He's forbidden is not without reason. Allah's wisdom lives in you. Every cell is perfectly portioned to serve its purpose. The perfect cooperation of all the cells working together until the time He has called you to return to Him.One of the best stories which illustrates how Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Hakeem is through the story of Yusuf (as). We provide a brief write-up for those unfamiliar, but it is told in a manner to cover the critical life events. We recommended reading Surah Yusuf with translation to get all the details of this fascinating story.Summary of the story of Prophet Yusuf (as):When Yusuf (as) was a child, he had a special relationship with his father, Yaqub (as). He told his father about a dream he had, ""O my father, indeed I have seen [in a dream] eleven stars and the sun and the moon; I saw them prostrating to me."" (Qur'an 12:4). Not knowing how or when, but he knew this vision was from Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. The other brothers grew envious of their relationship and plotted against Yusuf. One day Yusuf (as) went to play with his brothers, and they led him to a well. When he came close, they pushed him in and abandoned him.This set off a series of unfortunate events for Yusuf (as). A caravan of travelers stopped by the well and found the young boy. They pulled him out and rescued him but decided to pawn him off as a slave to a man named Aziz, the chief minister. Aziz treated Yusuf (as) well, and he remained loyal to Aziz, but Yusuf (as) had to grow up not knowing his family. Yusuf (as) matured into an intelligent, charming, and handsome man under the care of Aziz. Much is written about Yusuf (as) beauty, Prophet ﷺ mentions in Isra' and Mi'raj he met Yusuf (as) and Yusuf (as) had been given half of (world) beauty. [1]The story then takes yet another turn; Aziz's wife becomes infatuated with Yusuf (as) and seeks to seduce him, but he rejects her advances, ""[I seek] the refuge of Allah. Indeed, he is my master, who has made good my residence. Indeed, wrongdoers will not succeed."" (Qur'an 12:23) Hurt and embarrassed by the rejection, she tried to falsely accuse Yusuf (as) for approaching her, ""And they both raced to the door, and she tore his shirt from the back, and they found her husband at the door. She said, ""What is the recompense of one who intended evil for your wife but that he be imprisoned or a painful punishment?"" (Qur'an 12:25) Yusuf (as) denied this accusation, ""It was she who sought to seduce me."" (Qur'an 12:26). In the end, Yusuf (as) was found innocent since the shirt was ripped from the back, not the front, which was a sign of escape, not assault. Still, to safeguard Zulaikha (Aziz's wife) and protect her honor, Yusuf was sentenced by Aziz to prison despite being innocent.The next phase of his life was serving time in prison. While in prison, he developed a reputation for accurately interpreting dreams. One of Yusuf (as) former prison inmates, who was freed and served wine to the King, knew of this skill. So, when he heard the King was having trouble understanding a recurring dream, he advised the King to meet with Yusuf (as) was called upon. The dream was understood by Yusuf (as) to be a warning of an impending famine.From here, Yusuf's (as) innocence was proven, and his sentence was overturned. The King appointed him to work in storehouses to help prepare the city prepare for the famine. He worked hard over the years, and this eventually led him to be reunited with His father. وَرَفَعَ أَبَوَيۡهِ عَلَى ٱلۡعَرۡشِ وَخَرُّواْ لَهُۥ سُجَّدٗاۖ وَقَالَ يَـٰٓأَبَتِ هَٰذَا تَأۡوِيلُ رُءۡيَٰيَ مِن قَبۡلُ قَدۡ جَعَلَهَا رَبِّي حَقّٗاۖ وَقَدۡ أَحۡسَنَ بِيٓ إِذۡ أَخۡرَجَنِي مِنَ ٱلسِّجۡنِ وَجَآءَ بِكُم مِّنَ ٱلۡبَدۡوِ مِنۢ بَعۡدِ أَن نَّزَغَ ٱلشَّيۡطَٰنُ بَيۡنِي وَبَيۡنَ إِخۡوَتِيٓۚ إِنَّ رَبِّي لَطِيفٞ لِّمَا يَشَآءُۚ إِنَّهُۥ هُوَ ٱلۡعَلِيمُ ٱلۡحَكِيمُWa raf'a abawaihi alal arshi wa kharroo lahoo sujjadaa; wa qaala yaaa abati haaza taaweelu ru'yaaya min qablu qad ja'alahaa Rabbee haqqaa; wa qad ahsana beee iz akhrajanee minas sijni wa jaaa'a bikum minal badwi mim ba'di an nazaghash Shaitaanu bainee wa baina ikhwatee; inna Rabbee lateeful limaa yashaaa; innahoo Huwal Aleemul HakeemEnglish Translation:""And he raised his parents upon the throne, and they bowed to him in prostration. And he said, “O my father, this is the explanation of my vision of before. My Lord has made it reality. And He was certainly good to me when He took me out of prison and brought you [here] from bedouin life after Satan had induced [estrangement] between me and my brothers. Indeed, my Lord is Subtle in what He wills. Indeed, it is He who is the Knowing, the Wise."" — (Qur'an 12:100)Reflection:The lesson from the story - Yusuf's life was overcoming one obstacle after another. When there seemed to be light at the end of the tunnel, he realized it was just an oncoming train. Yet, with everything that happened, he takes it in stride. He tackles each situation with resolve and never loses hope or faith. Why? He believed in Allah's attribute of being Al-Hakeem, trusting He knows what to do and with whom.When we read about the story of Yusuf (as), we learn a crucial life lesson that it's impossible to connect the dots looking forwards. We can only connect them by looking backward. We see how Yusuf (as) endured all the pain to end up where he did. In the end, Yusuf (as) saved the people of Egypt from famine, attained immense success, and was reunited with his family. Ultimately the vision he had in his childhood came true. It was not easy, and he kept in pursuit; he believed in Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ and knew the dots would somehow connect in the future but never exactly knew how.This also brings about another question, if we could rewind the clock, should we tell Yusuf (as) not to play with his brothers that day? We know the answer is no, but we may still be reserved in our answer, not feeling one hundred percent confident. Our mind thinks maybe his life could've been better. Perhaps a route to the same destination with less pain? Even in our lives, we may wish things in our past may have gone differently. This goes to the idea that we will always wish for things to be better. We rarely embrace and accept reality as it is, even though it can't be any other way. But to the one who sees Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ as Al-Hakeem, they will recognize how all things are interconnected. Sometimes we should not just endure but learn to love and say alhamdulillah for the way the All-Wise has decreed things to unfold. كُتِبَ  عَلَيۡكُمُ  ٱلۡقِتَالُ  وَهُوَ  كُرۡهٞ  لَّكُمۡۖ  وَعَسَىٰٓ  أَن  تَكۡرَهُواْ  شَيۡـٔٗا  وَهُوَ  خَيۡرٞ  لَّكُمۡۖ  وَعَسَىٰٓ  أَن  تُحِبُّواْ  شَيۡـٔٗا  وَهُوَ  شَرّٞ  لَّكُمۡۚ  وَٱللَّهُ  يَعۡلَمُ  وَأَنتُمۡ  لَا  تَعۡلَمُونَKutiba alaikumulqitaalu wa huwa kurhullakum wa ‘asaaa an takrahoo shai'anw wa huwa khairullakum wa ‘asaaa an tuhibbo shai'anw wa huwa sharrullakum; wallaahu ya'lamu wa antum laa ta'lamoon (section 26)English Translation:""Fighting has been enjoined upon you while it is hateful to you. But perhaps you hate a thing and it is good for you; and perhaps you love a thing and it is bad for you. And Allah Knows, while you know not."" — (Qur'an 2:216)Event of Ifk:Another story of adversity comes from the seerah of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ. It surrounds the traumatic events that took place in an attempt to attack the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ and his family.[2] Ayat 11-20 from Surah Nur addresses this matter, but we'll focus on two verses in particular. إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ جَآءُو بِٱلۡإِفۡكِ عُصۡبَةٞ مِّنكُمۡۚ لَا تَحۡسَبُوهُ شَرّٗا لَّكُمۖ بَلۡ هُوَ خَيۡرٞ لَّكُمۡۚ لِكُلِّ ٱمۡرِيٕٖ مِّنۡهُم مَّا ٱكۡتَسَبَ مِنَ ٱلۡإِثۡمِۚ وَٱلَّذِي تَوَلَّىٰ كِبۡرَهُۥ مِنۡهُمۡ لَهُۥ عَذَابٌ عَظِيمٞInnal lazeena jaaa'oo bilifki ‘usbatum minkum; laa tahsaboohu sharral lakum bal huwa khairul lakum; likul limri'im minhum mak tasaba minal-ism; wallazee tawallaa kibrahoo minhum lahoo azaabun azeemEnglish Translation:""Indeed, those who came with falsehood are a group among you. Do not think it bad for you; rather it is good for you. For every person among them is what [punishment] he has earned from the sin, and he who took upon himself the greater portion thereof - for him is a great punishment."" — (Qur'an 24:11)In the tafsir of Maududi, it is written regarding this verse ""That is, you should not lose heart. Though the hypocrites, according to their own presumptions, have made the worst attack on you, it will eventually bring misfortune on them and will prove to be a blessing in disguise for you."" In the following verses, it continues mentioning: وَيُبَيِّنُ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمُ ٱلۡأٓيَٰتِۚ وَٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ حَكِيمٌWa yubaiyinul laahu lakumul Aayaat; wallaahu Aleemun HakeemEnglish Translation:""And Allah makes clear to you the verses, and Allah is Knowing and Wise."" — (Qur'an 24:18)This is yet another example of how we should believe in Allah's attribute of being All-Wise and All-Knowing. Things may not make sense to us at the moment, and to iterate the point, we can not connect the dots looking forwards. We know Allah knows the truth in every situation. Our duty is to find the good in every 'tragedy,' ""Do not think it bad for you; rather it is good for you."" In the hadith, it was narrated by Abu Hurairah who said: ""Mention of fever was made in the presence of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and a man cursed it. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: 'Do not curse it, for it erases sin as fire removes filth from iron.'"" [3]References:[1] Sahih Muslim 162a[2] Sahih al-Bukhari 4141[3] Sahih (Darussalam) Sunan Ibn Majah 3469"
الْوَدُودُ,Al-Wadud / Al-Wadood,The Most Loving,"The Most Loving, The Most Affectionate, The Beloved.","Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Wadud (in Arabic: ٱلْوَدُودُ), the most loving and affectionate. He is faithful to his servants and shows them the purest love. He is the singular source of all love and kindness. The One who loves His believing servants, and His believing servants adore Him.","From the root waw-dal-dal (و د د), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to love, to be affectionate, to long for, to desire, to wish for. The one who should be loved and whose friendship is to be earned.","Arabic Root:From the root waw-dal-dal (و د د), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to love, to be affectionate, to long for, to desire, to wish for. The one who should be loved and whose friendship is to be earned.In Arabic, love is written as حب (hub); the name Al-Wadud is derived from the word وُدّ (wudd), which means an act or expression of love. So, hubb is just the emotion, whereas wudd is the physical manifestation of that love. An outward expression of the inner feeling. Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ refers to Himself as Al-Wadud twice in the Qur'an. وَٱسۡتَغۡفِرُواْ رَبَّكُمۡ ثُمَّ تُوبُوٓاْ إِلَيۡهِۚ إِنَّ رَبِّي رَحِيمٞ وَدُودٞWastaghfiroo Rabbakum summa toobooo ilaih; inna Rabbee Raheemunw WadoodEnglish Translation:""And ask forgiveness of your Lord and then repent to Him. Indeed, my Lord is Merciful and Affectionate."" — (Qur'an 11:90) وَهُوَ ٱلۡغَفُورُ ٱلۡوَدُودُWa Huwal Ghafoorul WadoodEnglish Translation:""And He is the Forgiving, the Affectionate,"" — (Qur'an 85:14)Pairing with the name Al-Wadud:In these two ayat, we see the pairing of names with Ar-Rahim (The Most Merciful) and Al-Ghafur (The Oft-Forgiving) with Al-Wadud. Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ love for all His creation is unshakeable. If you ask a happily married couple, what's the most important truth to the success of your relationship? What's the secret sauce? The resounding answer is often trust or honesty in the relationship. They will say that once that trust is broken, it's near impossible to repair. It's like broken glass, it can be pieced back together, but you can still see all cracks.Allah's forgiveness is vast:Allah's forgiveness is full. When He forgives, He does not require anything in return. We learn from these two ayat that we're always able to receive His affection. Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ does not like to see His servant punished; rather, He loves to forgive, and He loves those He forgave. There is no wickedness, malice, or injustice. Everything done is within reason - even then, He is on the side of leniency to the one who returns to the straight path and is sincere in forgiveness, ""Say, 'O My servants who have transgressed against themselves [by sinning], do not despair of the mercy of Allah. Indeed, Allah forgives all sins. Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiving, the Merciful.'"" (Qur'an 39:53)Beloved Actions:Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ has provided us with many avenues to garner His love and affection; throughout this guide of the 99 names of Allah, we've covered many actions that are beloved by Him, but we'll include a few here:He loves all those who try, ""Allah loves those who are constantly repentant and loves those who purify themselves."" (Qur'an 2:222)He loves those who follow the Prophet ﷺ: ""Say, [O Muhammad], “If you should love Allah, then follow me, [so] Allah will love you and forgive you your sins. And Allah is Forgiving and Merciful."" (Qur'an 3:31)Two traits in you that Allah loves are (1) forbearance (meaning self-control/discipline) and (2) deliberateness.[1]Love for the Prophet ﷺ family and love for those appreciative of their current blessings. Narrated Ibn 'Abbas: that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: ""Love Allah for what He nourishes you with of His Blessings, love me due to the love of Allah, and love the people of my house due to the love of me."" [2]Love for gentleness.It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: ""Allah is Gentle and loves gentleness, and He grants reward for it that He does not grant for harshness.""[3]Many of the lessons from the ninety-names of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ are a reminder of characteristics we know we should live up to. Avoid just intellectualizing it. Take time to reflect on each one and really find a way to integrate these qualities into your life.Reflection:The believer benefits from knowing that Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Wadud. We recognize that we have a Lord who is all-loving, caring, and compassionate. There is not a single person on earth who's beyond receiving His love or forgiveness. It is a name that should inspire hope in the believer and quiet your concerns or doubt. Knowing that Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ loves us should encourage us to do more of the things that are beloved to Him.Abu Huraira reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: When Allah loves a servant, He calls Gabriel and says: Verily, I love so and so; you should also love him, and then Gabriel begins to love him. Then he makes an announcement in the heaven saying: Allah loves so and so and you also love him, and then the inhabitants of the Heaven (the Angels) also begin to love him and then there is conferred honour upon him in the earth; and when Allah is angry with any servant He calls Gabriel and says: I am angry with such and such and you also become angry with him, and then Gabriel also becomes angry and then makes an announcement amongst the inhabitants of heaven: Verily Allah is angry with so-and-so, so you also become angry with him, and thus they also become angry with him. Then he becomes the object of wrath on the earth also.[4]References:[1] Sahih (Darussalam) Jami at-Tirmidhi 2011[2] Hasan (Darussalam) Jami` at-Tirmidhi 3789[3] Sahih (Al-Albani) Sunan Abi Dawud 4807[4] Sahih Muslim 2637a"
الْمَجِيدُ,Al-Majeed,The All-Glorious,"The Most Glorious One, The Most Honorable.","Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Majeed (in Arabic: ٱلْمَجِيدُ), meaning the one who is the most glorious, honorable, dignified, noble, and generous. It is another name that covers several attributes. He is the only one deserving all praise and honor because He is all-glorious.","From the root mim-jim-dal (م ج د), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be glorious, dignified, majestic, noble, honorable, to be lauded, exalted, sublime, to be liberal, bountiful, and/or exceedingly generous.","Arabic Root:From the root mim-jim-dal (م ج د), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be glorious, dignified, majestic, noble, honorable, to be lauded, exalted, sublime, to be liberal, bountiful, and/or exceedingly generous.Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Majeed meaning The All-Glorious One. His excellence is unparalleled as it does not resemble anything else. It is unique and alone. To be all-glorious is not a single standalone attribute but the quality of perfection of several attributes together (similar to how we discuss in the name Al-Jaleel - The Majestic One). Imam Al-Ghazali writes, ""Al-Majid the All-Glorious is one who is noble in essence, beautiful in actions, and bountiful in gifts and in favours."" In Ahmad Zarruq's book The Loftiest Goal in Elucidating Allah's Most Beautiful Names, he writes, ""Al-Majīd comes from al-majd, namely, the furthermost limit of nobility which allows for no additional increase of such quality beyond it, since it is complete in itself and outwardly manifest.""In the Qur'an, it refers to Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ as Al-Majeed once, and it is beautifully paired with the name Al-Hamid (""The Praiseworthy""). After all, the one worthy of praise should be the one whose essence is excellence and nobility. قَالُوٓاْ أَتَعۡجَبِينَ مِنۡ أَمۡرِ ٱللَّهِۖ رَحۡمَتُ ٱللَّهِ وَبَرَكَٰتُهُۥ عَلَيۡكُمۡ أَهۡلَ ٱلۡبَيۡتِۚ إِنَّهُۥ حَمِيدٞ مَّجِيدٞQaalooo ata'jabeena min amril laahi rahmatul laahi wa barakaatuhoo alaikum Ahlal Bayt; innahoo Hameedun MajeedEnglish Translation:""They said, 'Are you amazed at the decree of Allah? May the mercy of Allah and His blessings be upon you, people of the house. Indeed, He is Praiseworthy and Honorable.'"" — (Qur'an 11:73) ذُو ٱلۡعَرۡشِ ٱلۡمَجِيدُZul Arshil MajeedEnglish Translation:""Honorable Owner of the Throne,"" — (Qur'an 85:15)Now, as the word Majeed is used to describe both the Qur'an and the throne as glorious, it has been perfected and should be viewed with high status and ranking. The Qur'an is a glorious book since it serves as guidance for all of humanity. Of His throne, it is said, ""His throne extends over the heavens and the Earth"" (Qur'an 2:255) قٓۚ وَٱلۡقُرۡءَانِ ٱلۡمَجِيدِQaaaf; wal Qur aanil MajeedEnglish Translation:""Qaf. By the honored Qur'an…"" — (Qur'an 50:1)From Hadith Literature:Ibn Abi Laila reported: Ka'b b. 'Ujra met me and said: Should I not offer you a present (and added): The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came to us and we said: We have learned how to invoke peace upon you; (kindly tell us) how we should bless you. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Say: ""O Allah: bless Muhammad and his family as Thou didst bless the family of Ibrahim. Verily Thou art (حَمِيدٌ - hamid) Praiseworthy and (مَجِيدٌ - majeed) Glorious, O Allah."" [1]Reflection:The believer benefits in knowing Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Majeed in two ways. The first is in worship. Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ holds all honor and glory, our success is through Allah. Seek His pleasure by sincere and honest devotion to Him. When we recite durood Ibrahim in our salah, we call on the names Al-Hameed and Al-Majeed. He is the one worthy of praise because of the name Al-Majeed, i.e., the perfection of all attributes. اللَّهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ وَعَلَى آلِ مُحَمَّدٍ كَمَا صَلَّيْتَ عَلَى إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَعَلَى آلِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ إِنَّكَ حَمِيدٌ مَجِيدٌ اللَّهُمَّ بَارِكْ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ وَعَلَى آلِ مُحَمَّدٍ كَمَا بَارَكْتَ عَلَى إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَعَلَى آلِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ إِنَّكَ حَمِيدٌ مَجِيدٌAllahumma Salli ‘ala Muhammadin wa ‘ala aali Muhammadin, kama sallaita ‘ala Ibrahima wa ‘ala aali Ibrahima innaka Hamidum-Majeed. Allahumma barik ‘ala Muhammadin wa ‘ala aali Muhammadin kama barakta ‘ala Ibrahima wa ‘ala aali Ibrahima innaka Hameedum-Majeed. [2]The second way a believer benefits from learning about Al-Majeed is by understanding that we should work on perfecting our attributes to raise our rank and increase our essence. To be a well-rounded Muslim means to work on our piety, devotion to Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ, studiousness, affection, kindness, generosity, etc. And to recoil from hypocrisy, falsehoods, and arrogance.References:[1] Sahih Muslim 406a[2] Sahih al-Bukhari 3370"
الْبَاعِثُ,Al-Ba'ith,The Infuser of New Life,"The Awakener, The Resurrector, The Arouser","Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Ba'ith (in Arabic: ٱلْبَاعِثُ), meaning the One who chooses who will be awakened and be sent forth. He is the giver of life and who sends light into the world. The One who resurrects His servants after death for reward and/or punishment.","From the root ba-ayn-tha (ب ع ث), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to call forth, awaken, to raise up from sleep or death, to resurrect, to delegate, consign, to send, send out, make manifest.","Arabic Root:From the root ba-ayn-tha (ب ع ث), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to call forth, awaken, to raise up from sleep or death, to resurrect, to delegate, consign, to send, send out, make manifest.Among the Disputed Names:Al-Ba'ith is one of the names of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ where there isn't a consensus. The more common opinion is that Al-Ba'ith is the name of Allah Azzawajal. As we mentioned previously, of the 99 names of Allah, 81 are explicitly mentioned in the Qur'an. The other attributes are derived elsewhere. The scholars' Ibn al-Arabi, Ibn Hazm, and al-Radwani have excluded this name, whereas al-Ghazali, al-Walid, and Ibn Mandah have recognized it.Al-Ba'ith - The Resurrector:This quality/attribute of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ describes how He will resurrect us from the dead. A final rebirth. He will awaken the dead and infuse them with a new life. It is written by Sheikh Tosun in his book, ""He will raise people from their graves and bring out all the actions, thoughts, and feelings that occurred during their liftetime on this earth.""  أَوَلَمۡ يَرَوۡاْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ ٱلَّذِي خَلَقَ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلۡأَرۡضَ وَلَمۡ يَعۡيَ بِخَلۡقِهِنَّ بِقَٰدِرٍ عَلَىٰٓ أَن يُحۡـِۧيَ ٱلۡمَوۡتَىٰۚ بَلَىٰٓۚ إِنَّهُۥ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيۡءٖ قَدِيرٞAwalam yaraw annal laahal lazee khalaqas samaawaati wal arda wa lam ya'ya bikhal qihinna biqaadirin ‘alaaa aiyuhyiyal mawtaa; balaaa innahoo ‘alaa kulli shai'in QadeerEnglish Translation: ""Do they not see that Allah, who created the heavens and earth and did not fail in their creation, is able to give life to the dead? Yes. Indeed, He is over all things competent."" — (Qur'an 46:33) وَأَنَّ ٱلسَّاعَةَ ءَاتِيَةٞ لَّا رَيۡبَ فِيهَا وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَبۡعَثُ مَن فِي ٱلۡقُبُورِWa annas Saa'ata aatiya tul laa raiba feeha wa annal laaha yab'asuman fil quboorEnglish Translation:"" And [that they may know] that the Hour is coming - no doubt about it - and that Allah will resurrect those in the graves."" — (Qur'an 22:7)Al-Ba'ith - The Sender:As mentioned in the Qur'an, the name Al-Ba'ith is not mentioned in the noun form, but many verses contain the verb form. For example, ""Bā'atha"" (He sent, 62:2), following this line, some commentators have mentioned an aspect of this name of sending forth something (for example, His Prophets and His Guidance). The other meaning is being the resurrector, ""Yabā'athu"" (will they be raised, 64:7). He has absolute power to change the state of a person from sleep to wakefulness. هُوَ ٱلَّذِي بَعَثَ فِي ٱلۡأُمِّيِّـۧنَ رَسُولٗا مِّنۡهُمۡ يَتۡلُواْ عَلَيۡهِمۡ ءَايَٰتِهِۦ وَيُزَكِّيهِمۡ وَيُعَلِّمُهُمُ ٱلۡكِتَٰبَ وَٱلۡحِكۡمَةَ وَإِن كَانُواْ مِن قَبۡلُ لَفِي ضَلَٰلٖ مُّبِينٖHuwal lazee ba'atha fil ummiyyeena Rasoolam min hum yatloo ‘alaihim aayaatihee wa yuzakkeehim wa yu'allimuhumul Kitaaba wal Hikmata wa in kaanoo min qablu lafee dalaalim mubeenEnglish Translation: ""It is He who has sent among the unlettered a Messenger from themselves reciting to them His verses and purifying them and teaching them the Book and wisdom - although they were before in clear error -"" — ( Qur'an 62:2)In this verse and many others which use the verb form, it is used to reference the Prophets (may peace be upon them) and how they were ""raised,"" ""risen,"" or ""sent"" to be a chosen messenger of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ and to warn of the inevitable resurrection. وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِي يَتَوَفَّىٰكُم بِٱلَّيۡلِ وَيَعۡلَمُ مَا جَرَحۡتُم بِٱلنَّهَارِ ثُمَّ يَبۡعَثُكُمۡ فِيهِ لِيُقۡضَىٰٓ أَجَلٞ مُّسَمّٗىۖ ثُمَّ إِلَيۡهِ مَرۡجِعُكُمۡ ثُمَّ يُنَبِّئُكُم بِمَا كُنتُمۡ تَعۡمَلُونَWa Huwal lazee yatawaf faakum billaili wa ya'lamu maa jarahtum binnahaari summa yab'asukum feehee liyuqdaaa ajalum musamman summa ilaihi marji'ukum summa yunabbi ‘ukum bimaa kuntum ta'maloon (section 7)English Translation: ""And it is He who takes your souls by night and knows what you have committed by day. Then He revives you therein that a specified term may be fulfilled. Then to Him will be your return; then He will inform you about what you used to do."" — ( Qur'an 6:60)Battle of Uhud:In the Qur'an, it was revealed to Prophet Muhammad ﷺ who said the following regarding the martyrs of the battle of Uhud. وَلَا تَحۡسَبَنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ قُتِلُواْ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ أَمۡوَٰتَۢاۚ بَلۡ أَحۡيَآءٌ عِندَ رَبِّهِمۡ يُرۡزَقُونَWa laa tahsabannal lazeena qutiloo fee sabeelillaahi amwaata; bal ahyaaa'un 'inda Rabbihim yurzaqoonEnglish Translation: ""And never think of those who have been killed in the cause of Allah as dead. Rather, they are alive with their Lord, receiving provision,"" — ( Qur'an 3:169)Reflection:Most of humanity understands that death is an inevitability. They know of it, but they do not really understand it. They treat death as non-existence, the end of the road, or finality. But the believer understands that death is just act one scene one of this play. In the next scene, we will be brought back and held accountable for all that transpired. We will be held responsible for our actions. This should not be a scary proposition. Rather we should be joyful about this revelation. It brings purpose and meaning to our existence, ""Then did you think that We created you uselessly and that to Us you would not be returned?"" ( Qur'an 23:115) So the one who understands the name Al-Ba'ith develops greater certainity in the day of resurrection and greater conviction in Allah's سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ promise.The name also creates a sense of responsibility within, a duty to ourselves to become better and avoid being a degenerate (i.e., a person with loose morals, corrupt, or showing signs of decline). It was narrated that Aishah said: ""The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to me: 'O 'Aishah, beware of (evil) deeds that are regarded as insignificant, for they have a pursuer from Allah. (i.e. accountability).""  [1]The realization of death also brings about a sense of urgency. We have, but a limited time on earth, so we should not squander it. It should inspire us to do good and rush to acts loved by Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. However you die here is how you will be brought back to life there, so seek good, and you will receive good. Death also brings to the surface the importance of moment-to-moment awareness, like a soldier about to be deployed overseas. They don't have any time to waste on trivial matters or petty arguments. They let all these things go, which tells you something about their importance. You can even imagine the week leading up to his deployment; he will handle all his affairs and be extremely loving and present. Why wait until the last second on our deathbeds to feel this way? Why wait before we're deployed and uncertain of the future? Is it because maybe we're taking tomorrow for granted? At any moment, we have the power to reflect on the name Al-Ba'ith and tap into the truth Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ has created this universe as a temporary place. Death is the inescapable reality we will all face. As mentioned in Surah Baqarah, ""Indeed we belong to Allah, and indeed to Him we will return."" ( Qur'an 2:156)In many places of the Qur'an, Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ has referred to as knowledge (ilm) as hayat life. The heart without knowledge (i.e., jahl or Ignorance) is death. So, you can revive yourself by pursuing knowledge and resurrect others by being generous with that information. Imam Ghazali mentions, ""Ignorance is the greatest death and knowledge the noblest life. [...] Whoever lifts another out of Ignorance to knowledge has already created him anew and revivified him to a blessed life."" References:[1] Sahih (Darussalam) Sunan Ibn Majah 4243"
الشَّهِيدُ,Ash-Shaheed / Ash-Shahid,The All Observing Witnessing,"The Witness, The All-Observant, The Testifier.","Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Ash-Shaheed (in Arabic: ٱلْشَّهِيدُ) meaning the one who is omnipresent and all-observing. There is nothing that we do that goes unnoticed, as He is ever-present and sees everything. His knowledge comprehends all, and He will be the ultimate witness on the day of judgment.","From the root shin-ha-dal (ش ه د), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to bear witness, to offer testimony, to have knowledge of, to experience, to be present with.","Arabic Root:From the root shin-ha-dal (ش ه د), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to bear witness, to offer testimony, to have knowledge of, to experience, to be present with.An Attribute of Ilm (knowledge):To be a witness is an attribute of knowledge. You cannot be a witness without being present or having knowledge or so unique insight or perspective on some matter. Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Ash-Shaheed, THE witness. He is the knower of the Ghayb (the unseen), the things that are concealed or invisible to man. It is because of the attribute of being Ash-Shaheed that on the day of judgment, He will reveal Himself as being the witness to all that has happened. يَعۡتَذِرُونَ إِلَيۡكُمۡ إِذَا رَجَعۡتُمۡ إِلَيۡهِمۡۚ قُل لَّا تَعۡتَذِرُواْ لَن نُّؤۡمِنَ لَكُمۡ قَدۡ نَبَّأَنَا ٱللَّهُ مِنۡ أَخۡبَارِكُمۡۚ وَسَيَرَى ٱللَّهُ عَمَلَكُمۡ وَرَسُولُهُۥ ثُمَّ تُرَدُّونَ إِلَىٰ عَٰلِمِ ٱلۡغَيۡبِ وَٱلشَّهَٰدَةِ فَيُنَبِّئُكُم بِمَا كُنتُمۡ تَعۡمَلُونَ,Ya'taziroona ilaikum izaa raja'tum ilaihim; qul laa ta'taziroo lan nu'mina lakum qad nabba annal laahu min akhbaarikum; wa sa yaral laahu 'amalakum wa Rasooluhoo thumma turaddoona ilaa 'Aalimil Ghaibi washshahaadati fa yunabbi'ukum bimaa kuntum ta'maloonEnglish Translation: ""They will make excuses to you when you have returned to them. Say, 'Make no excuse - never will we believe you. Allah has already informed us of your news. And Allah will observe your deeds, and [so will] His Messenger; then you will be taken back to the Knower of the unseen and the witnessed, and He will inform you of what you used to do.'"" — ( Qur'an 9:94) ٱرۡجِعُوٓاْ إِلَىٰٓ أَبِيكُمۡ فَقُولُواْ يَـٰٓأَبَانَآ إِنَّ ٱبۡنَكَ سَرَقَ وَمَا شَهِدۡنَآ إِلَّا بِمَا عَلِمۡنَا وَمَا كُنَّا لِلۡغَيۡبِ حَٰفِظِينَIrji'ooo ilaaa abeekum faqooloo yaaa abaanaaa innab naka saraq; wa maa shahidnaaa illaa bimaa 'alimnaa wa maa kunnaa lilghaibi haafizeenEnglish Translation: ""Return to your father and say, ""O our father, indeed your son has stolen, and we did not testify except to what we knew. And we were not witnesses of the unseen,"" — (Qur'an 12:81)This verse also helps us establish a connection to the previous name,  Al-Ba'ith  - The Resurrector. When we are raised from the grave, we will be held accountable. The only one who can be a judge is the one who has knowledge of the truth, ""we did not testify except to what we knew."" Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ knowledge is all-encompassing. He is Al-Alim (The All-Knowing) and Al-Khabir (The All-Aware). The explanation of the name Ash-Shaheed is similar to that of those names. We recommend reading the write-up provided for those names to become acquainted with the name of Ash-Shaheed.Now, as a name of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ it is mentioned throughout the Qur'an a total of 18 times. We will explore a few more verses here: يَوۡمَ يَبۡعَثُهُمُ ٱللَّهُ جَمِيعٗا فَيُنَبِّئُهُم بِمَا عَمِلُوٓاْۚ أَحۡصَىٰهُ ٱللَّهُ وَنَسُوهُۚ وَٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيۡءٖ شَهِيدٌYawma yab'asuhumul laahu jamee'an fayunabbi'uhum bimaa 'amiloo; ahsaahul laahu wa nasooh; wallaahu 'alaa kulli shai'in shaheedEnglish Translation: ""On the Day when Allah will resurrect them all and inform them of what they did. Allah had enumerated it, while they forgot it; and Allah is, over all things, Witness."" — (Qur'an 58:6) مَّآ أَصَابَكَ مِنۡ حَسَنَةٖ فَمِنَ ٱللَّهِۖ وَمَآ أَصَابَكَ مِن سَيِّئَةٖ فَمِن نَّفۡسِكَۚ وَأَرۡسَلۡنَٰكَ لِلنَّاسِ رَسُولٗاۚ وَكَفَىٰ بِٱللَّهِ شَهِيدٗاMaaa asaabaka min hasanatin faminal laahi wa maaa asaaabaka min saiyi'atin famin nafsik; wa arsalnaaka linnaasi Rasoolaa; wa kafaa billaahi ShaheedaaEnglish Translation: ""What comes to you of good is from Allah, but what comes to you of evil, [O man], is from yourself.

But is it not sufficient concerning your Lord that He is, over all things, a Witness?"" — ( Qur'an 41:53)Tip to help memorize the meaning of this name:To help remember the meaning of Ash-Shaheed, it can be useful to make the connection in your mind with this name and the shahadah (the testimony of faith), Ashhadu an la ilaha ill-Allah was ashhadu anna Muhammadan abduhu wa rasuluh (I bear witness that there is none worthy of worship except Allah, and I bear witness that Muhammad is his servant and Messenger).[1] Here ashhadu means, ""I bear witness,"" ""I testify"" and the name of Allah Ash-Shaheed is, ""The Witnesser,"" ""The Testifier."" Reflection:The believer benefits from knowing Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Ash-Shaheed. As we mentioned in previous names, it makes us cognizant of our actions. We will be held responsible on the day of judgment, so unattractive qualities within ourselves (e.g., envy, anger, pride, back-biting, etc.) should be conquered as these emotions work against you. This name also encourages humility, admitting mistakes, taking ownership over your actions, and seeking forgiveness from Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. So on that day, these mistakes will already be wiped from your account.Remember Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is enough for you as a witness. Whatever good you do, if no one sees or recognizes it, it doesn't matter as Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ sees all. Nothing goes unaccounted for. Having this knowledge allows a person to drop all forms of pettiness. Who cares if you did something good for someone and it wasn't reciprocated. You invited them to your wedding, but they didn't invite you. Allah is the witness, don't let others' lack of care affect the good you can do.References:[1] Sahih (Darussalam) Sunan An Nasai (632) and Sunan Ibn Majah (470) | The Messenger of Allah ﷺ in the hadith said: Whoever performs Wudu and does it well, then says the shahadat. Eight gates of Paradise will be opened for him, and he may enter through whichever one he wishes."
الْحَقُ,Al-Haqq,The Absolute Truth,"The Truth, The Real, The Embodiment of Truth.","Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Haqq (in Arabic: ٱلْحَقُّ), meaning: the only reality, the one who is the embodiment of truth, the absolute. Since He is the sole and true God, He has every right to be worshipped. His essence is unavoidable and unchanged.","From the root ha-qaf-qaf (ح ق ق), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be suitable, to the requirements of wisdom, justice, truth or fact. To be in accord with the needs of the situation, to be true, right, just, proper. To be genuine, authentic, real, sound, substantial. To be established, confirmed as fact. To be necessary, requisite, justified.","Arabic Root:From the root ha-qaf-qaf (ح ق ق), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be suitable, to the requirements of wisdom, justice, truth or fact. To be in accord with the needs of the situation, to be true, right, just, proper. To be genuine, authentic, real, sound, substantial. To be established, confirmed as fact. To be necessary, requisite, justified.Allah's Truth:Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ very essence is the truth. There are many layers of His truth. For example, His word is truth (the Qur'an and Messengers), our meeting with Him is truth (resurrection), and His promise is truth (heaven and hell). The truth, by definition, is also never changing. It's absolute or certain. In this manner, only Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is the truth. His existence is enduring and forever. Everything but Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ slowly deteriorates, so how can we trust in anything but Him. The Qur'an mentions, ""Indeed, what you are promised is to occur. So when the stars are obliterated And when the heaven is opened And when the mountains are blown away And when the messengers' time has come… For what Day was it postponed? For the Day of Judgement."" (Qur'an 77:7-13) ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ هُوَ ٱلۡحَقُّ وَأَنَّ مَا يَدۡعُونَ مِن دُونِهِ ٱلۡبَٰطِلُ وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ هُوَ ٱلۡعَلِيُّ ٱلۡكَبِيرُZaalika bi annal laaha Huwal Haqqu wa anna maa yad'oona min doonihil baatilu wa annal laaha Huwal 'Aliyyul Kabeer (section 3)English Translation: ""That is because Allah is the Truth, and that what they call upon other than Him is falsehood, and because Allah is the Most High, the Grand."" — (Qur'an 31:30)The understanding that Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is the embodiment of truth is also a testimony to His judgment and knowledge as being perfect. With this understanding, we should adhere to the guidance He set forth. Sometimes, we may find restrictions that seem inconvenient or without cause, but we should realize that we don't always know what's best for us. We must trust Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ knows best. Therefore the believer should show self-restraint and be subservient to the truth. فَذَٰلِكُمُ ٱللَّهُ رَبُّكُمُ ٱلۡحَقُّۖ فَمَاذَا بَعۡدَ ٱلۡحَقِّ إِلَّا ٱلضَّلَٰلُۖ فَأَنَّىٰ تُصۡرَفُونَFazaalikumul laahu Rabbukumul haqq; famaazaa ba'dal haqqi illad dalaalu fa anna tusrafoonEnglish Translation:"" For that is Allah, your Lord, the Truth.

Many think truth is science, but this is false. There is no objective truth in science. Rather science's whole objective is to disprove that which we currently know. Only in the failure to disprove do we develop some kind of understanding of what is ""true,"" i.e., until it is disproven. This is the scientific process. Its goal is not to provide conclusions but to provide a model of reality consistent with the collective observations of humanity sustained over time. Things that have been ""true"" for thousands of years are things that have been thoroughly tested and therefore earned a higher degree of trust. Even then, paradigm shifts exist. There was a time when the predominant view was that the Earth was flat and not round. At one point, diabetes patients were encouraged to eat sugar because it seemed their bodies were just good at removing sugar from their system. So to compensate, doctors suggested eating more sugar to make up for the loss. They only discovered this was not the case through trial and error. It's hard to know the things we don't know. Every generation should have fewer blindspots than the previous, so we can have more confidence now than at any time in the past.[1] But that's not to say blindspots don't or can't exist. What if the reality we know today is just an illusion? A limitation of our sensory organs or the first layer of a larger painting? We may never know whether our observations are real or just shadows of what is real. The Qur'an states, ""The life of this world is nothing but delusion"" (Qur'an 57:20). So we've come to the point where we must accept that we know close to nothing. It's freeing... we realize how little anybody knows, and that's a good place to start as it opens the door for humility and exposes us to the openness of all possibilities. The one and only absolue truth we can be sure of is la ilaha illallah muhammadur rasulullah, ""There is no deity but Allah. Prophet Muhammad ﷺ is His messenger.""Abu Hanifa and The Atheist:Ibn Abi al-'Izz reported: It is said that Abu Hanifa, may Allah have mercy on him, was approached by some philosophers who intended to discuss with him the oneness of Allah's Lordship. Abu Hanifa said, ""Before we discuss this question, tell me what you think about a boat in the Euphrates, which goes to shore, loads itself with food and other things, then returns, anchors and unloads all by itself, without anyone sailing or controlling it?"" They said, ""This is impossible."" Abu Hanifa said, ""If it is impossible with a boat, then how is it possible for the world, in all its vastness, to move by itself?"" The point Abu Hanifa makes is that underlying every assertion - the one who causes it to be is Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. These things don't need to be exclusive of one another; they can coexist. To be a believer in science is to be a witness and see Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. You observe and appreciate the manifestation of His creation.Supplications which include the name Al-Haqq:It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to say in his Talbiyah: ""Labbaika ilahal-haqq, labbaika (Here I am, O god of Truth, here I am)."" [2]Narrated Ibn Abbas: When the Prophet (ﷺ) got up at night to offer the Tahajjud prayer, he used to say:[3]اللَّهُمَّ لَكَ الْحَمْدُ أَنْتَ قَيِّمُ السَّمَوَاتِ وَالأَرْضِ وَمَنْ فِيهِنَّ وَلَكَ الْحَمْدُ لَكَ مُلْكُ السَّمَوَاتِ وَالأَرْضِ وَمَنْ فِيهِنَّ وَلَكَ الْحَمْدُ أَنْتَ نُورُ السَّمَوَاتِ وَالأَرْضِ وَلَكَ الْحَمْدُ أَنْتَ الْحَقُّ وَوَعْدُكَ الْحَقُّ وَلِقَاؤُكَ حَقٌّ وَقَوْلُكَ حَقٌّ وَالْجَنَّةُ حَقٌّ وَالنَّارُ حَقٌّ وَالنَّبِيُّونَ حَقٌّ وَمُحَمَّدٌ صلى الله عليه وسلم حَقٌّ وَالسَّاعَةُ حَقٌّ اللَّهُمَّ لَكَ أَسْلَمْتُ وَبِكَ آمَنْتُ وَعَلَيْكَ تَوَكَّلْتُ وَإِلَيْكَ أَنَبْتُ وَبِكَ خَاصَمْتُ وَإِلَيْكَ حَاكَمْتُ فَاغْفِرْ لِي مَا قَدَّمْتُ وَمَا أَخَّرْتُ وَمَا أَسْرَرْتُ وَمَا أَعْلَنْتُ أَنْتَ الْمُقَدِّمُ وَأَنْتَ الْمُؤَخِّرُ لاَ إِلَهَ إِلاَّ أَنْتَAllahumma lakal-hamd.

We live following the message of Islam to receive His promise. The Qur'an is the book of truth coming from Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. It teaches us the basics of enjoying life while honoring our duties. It provides a blueprint for how we should structure our life, what kind of person we should be, the importance of this life, and the greater significance of the next.References:[1] As an aside - This is not meant to be an anti-science remark or stance.

الْوَكِيلُ,Al-Wakeel,The Trustee,"The Universal Trustee, The Disposer of Affairs, The Trustworthy.","Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Wakeel (in Arabic: ٱلْوَكِيلُ), the one and only who can be trusted with all our affairs. He is the supreme trustee, guardian, and administrator. A believer understands the rewards of his efforts come from Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ, and therefore He entrusts his faith fully in Him.","From the root waw-kaf-lam (و ك ل), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to appoint or entrust for the care or management of something, to have a commissioned agent, a guardian of one's interests, to rely upon, confide in, lean upon, submit to.","Arabic Root:From the root waw-kaf-lam (و ك ل), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to appoint or entrust for the care or management of something, to have a commissioned agent, a guardian of one's interests, to rely upon, confide in, lean upon, submit to.Who can we trust?Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Wakeel, the one to be entrusted with all of our affairs. This relationship is entirely voluntary; it is on the part of the believer to recognize that Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is the authority we should trust. An authoritarian leader, a corrupt government, or an institution may try to make the people dependent on them to enforce being entrusted out of necessity. But the reality is they are deficient and clawing to hold onto power. They cannot fulfill the demands of all the people. They are limited in capacity and resources. Secondly, whether they realize it or not, their existence is finite. Only Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ existence is eternal. Therefore it would be wise for us to bring our affairs to the one who can act on them long after we're gone. Only Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ has that kind of power, longevity, and capacity. He is the only deity deserving of having all matters entrusted to Him.Sheikh Tosun Bayrak mentions of this name, ""He completes the work left to Him without leaving anything undone."" People think of themselves as capable, but it is Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ who allows for everything. It's like if you were a duck floating in a pond while it's been raining, and you keep going up in the world. After some time, you think it's you and not the rain. You may say to yourself, ""I must be one good duck."" Realize Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ gives people specific tests of wealth and poverty or success and failure. The question in each circumstance is how will they respond to these happenings? Who will they turn to help handle their affairs?Imam Ghazali writes, ""But those so entrusted may be distinguished into one entrusted with some things (and that one is deficient) or one to whom everything is entrusted, and this is none but God - may He be praised and exalted."" Only Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is trustworthy, knowledgable, and has the complete power to protect and provide the best care for His servant. Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is the all compassionate, the all powerful, the all wise. Allah is sufficient for you as a guardian, and belief and trust in this is the meaning of tawakkul. This does not excuse the need for one to provide for themselves, a true believer understands they must apply themselves to the best of their abilities. But it is Allah who decides to do what He wills and controls the outcome.Hadith of the camel:This concept is beautifully illustrated in the famous hadith. Anas bin Malik narrated that a man said: ""O Messenger of Allah! Shall I tie it and rely (upon Allah), or leave it loose and rely (upon Allah)?"" He said: ""Tie it and rely (upon Allah)."" [1] There is no need to over complicate such a simple life philosophy. Complete trust and faithfulness in Allah's plan invite peace into your life. Worldly pursuit, ambitions, and not meeting your expectations cause misery and anxiety. Acceptance frees the mind from the prison it creates. Supplication of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ:The name Al-Wakeel was also invoked in a du'a of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ. He recited this du'a at a time of distress, at a time when he needed His Lord to help him overcome the adversity he faced. He suffered a great loss to Abu Sufyan in the battle of Uhud. His army of 700 fought against 3000 Meccan soldiers. The losses of Uhud reported 70 Muslims were killed, and only 22 of the 3000 Medinan soldiers had died. Prophet Muhammad himself was injured and bloodied in battle. You can imagine the conviction he had when he said these words. The morale among his companions was low, yet he recited these words as revealed in Surah Imran. ٱلَّذِينَ قَالَ لَهُمُ ٱلنَّاسُ إِنَّ ٱلنَّاسَ قَدۡ جَمَعُواْ لَكُمۡ فَٱخۡشَوۡهُمۡ فَزَادَهُمۡ إِيمَٰنٗا وَقَالُواْ حَسۡبُنَا ٱللَّهُ وَنِعۡمَ ٱلۡوَكِيلُAllazeena qaala lahumun naasu innan naasa qad jama'oo lakum fakhshawhum fazaadahum emaananw wa qaaloo hasbunal laahu wa ni'mal wakeelEnglish Translation: ""Those to whom hypocrites said, 'Indeed, the people have gathered against you, so fear them.' But it [merely] increased them in faith, and they said, 'Sufficient for us is Allah, and [He is] the best Disposer of affairs.'"" — ( Qur'an 3:173)The part of the ayat which contains the du'a has been bolded for your reference. This was also mentioned in the hadith narrated by Ibn Abbas:"" 'Allah is Sufficient for us and He Is the Best Disposer of affairs,' was said by Abraham when he was thrown into the fire; and it was said by Muhammad.""  [2] Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ takes care of all those who turn to Him in their time of need. We may trust our spouse, friends, or family, but in the truest sense, they can't hold the title of being ""the trustee."" وَلِلَّهِ مَا فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِي ٱلۡأَرۡضِۚ وَكَفَىٰ بِٱللَّهِ وَكِيلًاWa lillaahi maa fis samaawaati wa maa fil ard; wa kafaa billaahi WakeelaaEnglish Translation:"" And to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. And sufficient is Allah as Disposer of affairs."" — (Qur'an 4:132) رَّبُّ ٱلۡمَشۡرِقِ وَٱلۡمَغۡرِبِ لَآ إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ فَٱتَّخِذۡهُ وَكِيلٗاRabbul mashriqi wal maghriibi laaa ilaaha illaa Huwa fattakhizhu wakeelaaEnglish Translation:"" [He is] the Lord of the East and the West; there is no deity except Him, so take Him as Disposer of [your] affairs."" — (Qur'an 73:9)Umar bin Al-Khattab narrated that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: ""If you were to rely upon Allah with the required reliance, then He would provide for you just as a bird is provided for, it goes out in the morning empty, and returns full.""  [3]Reflection:The believer benefits from knowing that Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Wakeel. Just like the bird who goes out in search of food every day and finds its sustenance, the one who trusts in Allah's سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ plan will be taken care of. That's not to say there won't be any struggle. The bird still has to leave the nest in search of food - principles like the early bird getting the worm still have merit. Personal effort is a necessary precursor for change. However, the outcome of that effort is up to Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. In the Qur'an, it says, ""for each one are successive [angels] before and behind him who protect him by the decree of Allah. Indeed, Allah will not change the condition of a people until they change what is in themselves."" ( Qur'an 13:11) It's unreasonable to expect different results if you continually repeat the same old habits. If you want to see change, you have to change. Surrender to Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ, make du'a for whatever it is you wish, and work in pursuit towards that goal. ذَٰلِكُمُ ٱللَّهُ رَبُّكُمۡۖ لَآ إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَۖ خَٰلِقُ كُلِّ شَيۡءٖ فَٱعۡبُدُوهُۚ وَهُوَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيۡءٖ وَكِيلٞZaalikumul laahu Rabbukum laaa ilaaha illaa huwa khaaliqu kulli shai'in fa'budooh; wa huwa 'alaa kulli shai'inw WakeelEnglish Translation: ""That is Allah, your Lord; there is no deity except Him, the Creator of all things, so worship Him. And He is Disposer of all things."" — (Qur'an 6:102)References:[1] Hasan (Darussalam) Jami at-Tirmidhi 2517[2] Sahih Bukhari 4563[3] Hasan (Darussalam) Jami` at-Tirmidhi 2344"
الْقَوِيُ,Al-Qawiyy / Al-Qawi,The All-Strong,"The Most Strong, Perfect Power, The One with inexhaustible strength.","Allah ٱلْقَوِيُّ is Al-Qawiyy (in Arabic: ٱلْقَوِيُّ), meaning the one who commands all power and whose strength is unparalleled to anything else. His strength is truly unlimited and inexhaustible. Man's strength does not compare to that of Allah the Almighty.","From the root qaf-waw-ya (ق و ي), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be strong, vigorous, potent, to be robust, hardy, sturdy, to have sufficient strength or power, to prevail over.","Arabic Root:From the root qaf-waw-ya (ق و ي), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be strong, vigorous, potent, to be robust, hardy, sturdy, to have sufficient strength or power, to prevail over.The name Al-Qawiyy (sometimes written as Al-Qawi) is mentioned a total of nine times in the Qur'an. It refers to Allah's attribute of being strong. The one who has perfect power. He is eternal; death is not something that touches Him. From Ayatul Kursi, ""Neither drowsiness overtakes Him nor sleep."" (Qur'an 2:255) No weakness or deficiencies reach Him. His strength is inexhaustible and overcomes all.He is the most strong. To be strong is a broader concept than power or some manifestation of physical strength. In a sense it describes Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ entity as being perfected. He does not suffer from any weakness, whether it be His sight, hearing, judgment, or knowledge. He can provide whatever for whomever. With regard to His life, it is absolutely enduring forever. He is strong in all aspects - there are no exceptions.Because of His perfect strength, we rely upon Him for our success alone. Given a choice between two leaders, you would likely choose the one whose power was unmatched (assuming they are not morally corrupt). Similarily, Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ has unlimited capacity and possess superior judgement. He is the only one who can provide the comfort and protection we seek. For this reason, this name is often mentioned in pairs with Al-Aziz (The Mighty) or Al-Matin (The Firm). Imam Al-Ghazali has noted, ""Strength indicates perfect power, while firmness indicates intensification of strength."" Allah's decree is immovable. Whatever He wills will happen, and nothing can prevent it. قَالَتۡ إِحۡدَىٰهُمَا يَـٰٓأَبَتِ ٱسۡتَـٔۡجِرۡهُۖ إِنَّ خَيۡرَ مَنِ ٱسۡتَـٔۡجَرۡتَ ٱلۡقَوِيُّ ٱلۡأَمِينُQaalat ihdaahumaa yaaa abatis taajirhu inna khaira manistaajartal qawiyyul ameenEnglish Translation: ""One of the women said, 'O my father, hire him. Indeed, the best one you can hire is the strong and the trustworthy.'"" — (Qur'an 28:26) مَا قَدَرُواْ ٱللَّهَ حَقَّ قَدۡرِهِۦٓۚ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَقَوِيٌّ عَزِيزٌMaa qadrul laaha haqqa qadrih; innal laaha la Qawiyyun 'AzeezEnglish Translation:""They have not appraised Allah with true appraisal. Indeed, Allah is Powerful and Exalted in Might."" — (Qur'an 22:74) ٱللَّهُ لَطِيفُۢ بِعِبَادِهِۦ يَرۡزُقُ مَن يَشَآءُۖ وَهُوَ ٱلۡقَوِيُّ ٱلۡعَزِيزُAllahu lateefum bi'ibaadihee yarzuqu mai yashaaa'u wa Huwal Qawiyyul 'Azeez (Section 2)English Translation:""Allah is Subtle with His servants; He gives provisions to whom He wills. And He is the Powerful, the Exalted in Might."" — (Qur'an 42:19)Reflection: He has unlimited capability and should be feared in the sense that if He chose to go against you, you would be helpless. In the Qur'an, ""If Allah should aid you, no one can overcome you; but if He should forsake you, who is there that can aid you after Him? And upon Allah let the believers rely."" (Qur'an 3:160) Nothing is able to stand on its own. There is a consequence when we exercise or use any strength or power. In a physical sense, for example, in lifting weights, we get tired and need to rest. There is a limit to what we're capable of. Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ does not get tired. He created the entirety of the universe with ease and can do so many times over. Our moment-to-moment existence is because Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ sustains it until the appointed time. There is not a thing that has indepence or strength but Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ.Supplication of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ:It was narrated that Abu Musa said: ""The Prophet ﷺ heard me saying: 'La hawla wa la quwwata illa billah (there is no power and no strength except with Allah).' He said: 'O 'Abdullah bin Qais! Shall I not tell you of a word which is one of the treasures of Paradise?' I said: 'Yes, O Messenger of Allah.' He said: 'Say: La hawla wa la quwwata illa billah (There is no power and no strength except with Allah).'"" [1]From this comes humility in understanding whatever strength or ability we possess, it is from Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. We should derive power and confidence from our belief in Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. This is like when Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ commanded Musa (as) with His message to ""Go to Firaawn; (Pharaoh) Indeed, he has transgressed."" (Qur'an 20:24) Can you imagine criticizing any King, let alone the tyrannical King of Egypt, and say to him that he has transgressed? It is quite paradoxical; our fear in Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ should be a source of courage and strength in this life to do what is right. To stand up in the face of injustice and to try and aid those oppressed. The strong believer is the one who believes in the most strong, Al-Qawiyy. لَقَدۡ أَرۡسَلۡنَا رُسُلَنَا بِٱلۡبَيِّنَٰتِ وَأَنزَلۡنَا مَعَهُمُ ٱلۡكِتَٰبَ وَٱلۡمِيزَانَ لِيَقُومَ ٱلنَّاسُ بِٱلۡقِسۡطِۖ وَأَنزَلۡنَا ٱلۡحَدِيدَ فِيهِ بَأۡسٞ شَدِيدٞ وَمَنَٰفِعُ لِلنَّاسِ وَلِيَعۡلَمَ ٱللَّهُ مَن يَنصُرُهُۥ وَرُسُلَهُۥ بِٱلۡغَيۡبِۚ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ قَوِيٌّ عَزِيزٞLaqad arsalnaa Rusulanaa bilbaiyinaati wa anzalnaa ma'ahumul Kitaaba wal Meezaana liyaqooman naasu bilqist, wa anzalnal hadeeda feehi baasun shadeedunw wa manaafi'u linnaasi wa liya'lamal laahu many yansuruhoo wa Rusulahoo bilghaib; innal laaha Qawiyyun AzeezEnglish Translation:""We sent aforetime our messengers with Clear Signs and sent down with them the Book and the Balance (of Right and Wrong), that men may stand forth in justice; and We sent down Iron, in which is (material for) mighty war, as well as many benefits for mankind, that Allah may test who it is that will help, Unseen, Him and His messengers: For Allah is Full of Strength, Exalted in Might (and able to enforce His Will)."" — (Qur'an 57:25) وَرَدَّ ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ بِغَيۡظِهِمۡ لَمۡ يَنَالُواْ خَيۡرٗاۚ وَكَفَى ٱللَّهُ ٱلۡمُؤۡمِنِينَ ٱلۡقِتَالَۚ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ قَوِيًّا عَزِيزٗاWa raddal laahul lazeena kafaroo bighaizihim lam yanaaloo khairaa; wa kafal laahul mu'mineenal qitaal; wa kaanal laahu Qawiyyan 'Azeezaa English Translation:""And Allah repelled those who disbelieved, in their rage, not having obtained any good.

Strive for that which will benefit you, seek the help of Allah, and do not feel helpless. If anything befalls you, do not say, ""if only I had done such and such,"" rather say ""Qaddara Allahu wa ma sha'a fa'ala (Allah has decreed, and whatever he wills, He does)."" For (saying) 'If' opens (the door) to the deeds of Satan.'""  [2]References:[1] Sahih (Darussalam) Sunan Ibn Majah 3824[2] Sahih (Darussalam) Sunan Ibn Majah 79"
الْمَتِينُ,Al-Matin / Al-Mateen,The Firm One,The One with extreme Power which is un-interrupted and He does not get tired.,"Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Matin (in Arabic: ٱلْمَتِينُ), meaning His power is steadfast. It is the same as it was yesterday and will remain tomorrow. He is ever-constant and firm.","From the root mim-ta-nun (م ت ن), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be strong, stout, firm, hard, to be solid, robust, to be steadfast, certain, sure, to possess any quality in a strong degree, the hard outer or apparent part of something, elevated and hard ground.","Arabic Root:From the root mim-ta-nun (م ت ن), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be strong, stout, firm, hard, to be solid, robust, to be steadfast, certain, sure, to possess any quality in a strong degree, the hard outer or apparent part of something, elevated and hard ground.The names Al-Qawiyy (The Strong) and Al-Matin (The Firm) are often grouped together for being closely related in their meaning. The distinction is Al-Qawiyy refers to Allah's strength, He possesses perfect power. Al-Matin/Al-Mateen is an extension of His strength but focuses on its intensity. It refers to the quality of being solid, unwavering, and unshakable. When this name is paired with the name Ar-Razzaq, it means His provision is firm. Nothing disrupts its flow - no force can disrupt or weaken it. When paired with the name Al-Qawiyy, it means His strength is firm. Nothing can challenge or cause Him difficulty. So, it is generally stated that Al-Matin is the perfection of His power, and it can't be counteracted or resisted. إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ هُوَ ٱلرَّزَّاقُ ذُو ٱلۡقُوَّةِ ٱلۡمَتِينُInnal laaha Huwar Razzaaqu Zul Quwwatil MateenEnglish Translation:""Indeed, it is Allah who is the [continual] Provider, the firm possessor of strength."" — (Qur'an 51:58)There is only one instance of the name Al-Mateen in the Qur'an. There are many other verses where Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ describes His plan as being firm. We can't comprehend the nuances and intricacies of His plans, but we know His plans are without flaws and will be acted out. ""And you see the mountains, thinking them rigid, while they will pass as the passing of clouds. [It is] the work of Allah, who perfected all things. Indeed, He is Acquainted with that which you do."" (Qur'an 27:88) and ""Allāh has written [i.e., decreed], 'I will surely overcome, I and My messengers.' Indeed, Allāh is Powerful and Exalted in Might."" (Qur'an 58:21) وَأُمۡلِي لَهُمۡۚ إِنَّ كَيۡدِي مَتِينٌWa umlee lahum; inna kaidee mateenEnglish Translation:""And I will give them time. Indeed, my plan is firm."" — (Qur'an 7:183) وَأُمۡلِي لَهُمۡۚ إِنَّ كَيۡدِي مَتِينٌWa umlee lahum; inna kaidee mateenEnglish Translation:""And I will give them time. Indeed, My plan is firm."" — (Qur'an 68:45)Reflection:The believer benefits from learning about how Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Mateen. We recognize the importance of remaining firm in both the good and the bad. We must understand in life, we are either coming out of some difficulty or heading towards one. It's going to happen; life is a joyful experience mixed with some sadness. It's the way of life for everyone - to believe otherwise would be naïve. We don't think anything can ever go wrong when things are going well. And when things are bad, we feel as though they will remain bad forever.We must try our best to be firm in our patience and in our deen. Anas said, ""The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, most frequently said, ""O Allah, O Overturner of hearts, make my heart firm in Your deen.""[1] Firmness in faith means flexibility with what Allah has planned for us. The trials of life are not unique to us; many have gone through something similar. Don't ask how to avoid the winters. That's not a possibility. Instead, we need to learn how to prepare and handle them. Some winters will be short, others will be long, and they will regularly come after fall. When it comes, remember firmness and resolve in Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. Say, ""la hawla wala quwwata illa billahil aliyyil azim"", ""there is no power and no strength except with Allah."" Be firm in your faith and trust that whatever test Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ has given you that it is within your capacity to solve.It was narrated from Al Bara bin Azib that the Prophet said: ""Allah will keep firm those who believe, with the world that stands firm in this world, and in the Hereafter. This was revelated concerning the torment in the grave. It will be said to him (the deceased: 'Who is your Lord?' and he will say: 'My Lord is Allah and my Prophet is Muhammad. That is what is (the meaning of) His saying: Allah will keep firm those who believe, with the word that stands firm in this world, and in the Hereafter"".

الْوَلِيُّ,Al-Waliy / Al-Wali,The Protecting Associate,"The Protecting Friend, The Supporter, The Patron.","Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Waliy (in Arabic: ٱلْوَلِيُّ), meaning the true protector. He is supportive and loves His servants, protecting them from evil. Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ wants victory for us and will guide mankind towards the path of righteousness.","From the root waw-lam-ya (و ل ي), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be near, close, nearby, to be a friend, helper, supporter, to defend, guard (lit. friendly dealing), to be in charge, to turn one toward something, to be the master, owner, lord.","Arabic Root:From the root waw-lam-ya (و ل ي), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be near, close, nearby, to be a friend, helper, supporter, to defend, guard (lit. friendly dealing), to be in charge, to turn one toward something, to be the master, owner, lord.Al-Waliyy refers to the attribute of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ being a close friend or ally. He wants you to know you're protected, supported, and looked after. He provides them with peace, guidance, and success in this life and the hereafter. Now, Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is also Al-Khaliq (The Creator), and we understand this to mean that we are His servants. But this is just one categorization of our possible relationship with Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. There are a group of people who are His friends/allies called awliyah of Allah, friends of Allah (awliyah is the plural of wali). وَمَن يَتَوَلَّ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُۥ وَٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ فَإِنَّ حِزۡبَ ٱللَّهِ هُمُ ٱلۡغَٰلِبُونَWa mai yatawallal laaha wa Rasoolahoo wallazeena aamanoo fa inna hizbal laahi humul ghaaliboon (section 8)English Translation:""And whoever is an ally of Allah and His Messenger and those who have believed - indeed, the party of Allah - they will be the predominant."" — (Qur'an 5:56)Awliyah of Allah:On the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, “Verily Allah ta'ala has said: ‘Whosoever shows enmity to a wali (friend) of Mine, then I have declared war against him. And My servant does not draw near to Me with anything more loved to Me than the religious duties I have obligated upon him. And My servant continues to draw near to me with nafil (supererogatory) deeds until I Love him. When I Love him, I am his hearing with which he hears, and his sight with which he sees, and his hand with which he strikes, and his foot with which he walks. Were he to ask [something] of Me, I would surely give it to him; and were he to seek refuge with Me, I would surely grant him refuge.'” [1]We can read about who the awliyah of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ are, but we should realize it's a status that is within our grasp. We should not read these stories without feeling inspired that it's possible for us. The Qur'an states by being a believer, you are a friend of His. The question then is how can one become the foremost elect of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. The answer is simple, but the practice is hard. It's to be dutiful and fulfill your obligations. To do good and obey His commands. Once that's established, go the extra mile and taste the sweetness in involuntary acts which are encouraged but not mandatory. Sheikh Tosun Bayrak writes, ""There is neither fear nor sadness for them (referring to the believer), for they do not know any other friend but Allah. They fear nothing except opposing Allah's pleasure."" ٱللَّهُ  وَلِيُّ  ٱلَّذِينَ  ءَامَنُواْ  يُخۡرِجُهُم  مِّنَ  ٱلظُّلُمَٰتِ  إِلَى  ٱلنُّورِۖ  وَٱلَّذِينَ  كَفَرُوٓاْ  أَوۡلِيَآؤُهُمُ  ٱلطَّـٰغُوتُ  يُخۡرِجُونَهُم  مِّنَ  ٱلنُّورِ  إِلَى  ٱلظُّلُمَٰتِۗ  أُوْلَـٰٓئِكَ  أَصۡحَٰبُ  ٱلنَّارِۖ  هُمۡ  فِيهَا  خَٰلِدُونَAllaahu waliyyul lazeena aamanoo yukhrijuhum minaz zulumaati ilan noori wallazeena kafarooo awliyaaa'uhumut Taaghootu yukhrijoonahum minan noori ilaz zulumaat; ulaaa'ika Ashaabun Naari hum feehaa khaalidoon (section 34)English Translation:""Allah is the ally of those who believe. He brings them out from darknesses into the light. And those who disbelieve - their allies are Taghut. They take them out of the light into darknesses. Those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide eternally therein."" — (Qur'an 2:257) إِنَّمَا وَلِيُّكُمُ ٱللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُۥ وَٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ ٱلَّذِينَ يُقِيمُونَ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ وَيُؤۡتُونَ ٱلزَّكَوٰةَ وَهُمۡ رَٰكِعُونَInnamaa waliyyukumul laahu wa Rasooluhoo wal lazeena aamanul lazeena yuqeemoonas Salaata wa yu'toonaz Zakaata wa hum raaki'oonEnglish Translation:""Your ally is none but Allah and [therefore] His Messenger and those who have believed - those who establish prayer and give zakah, and they bow [in worship]."" — (Qur'an 5:55)We can see from these verses, Waliyy is mentioned as an ally, a working partner who ensures success for the believer. This encompasses one meaning of Waliyy. It can also refer to protection, as in the case of guardianship. For example, in Arabic, أولياء means parents, and someone who has ""Wilayah"" is said to be the authority, ruler, or legal guardian. Verses from the Qur'an that reflect this quality of Al-Wali: وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِي يُنَزِّلُ ٱلۡغَيۡثَ مِنۢ بَعۡدِ مَا قَنَطُواْ وَيَنشُرُ رَحۡمَتَهُۥۚ وَهُوَ ٱلۡوَلِيُّ ٱلۡحَمِيدُWa Huwal lazee yunazzilul ghaisa min ba'di maa qanatoo wa yanshuru rahmatah; wa Huwal Waliyyul HameedEnglish Translation:""And it is He who sends down the rain after they had despaired and spreads His mercy. And He is the Protector, the Praiseworthy."" — (Qur'an 42:28) إِنَّ وَلِـِّۧيَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِي نَزَّلَ ٱلۡكِتَٰبَۖ وَهُوَ يَتَوَلَّى ٱلصَّـٰلِحِينَInna waliyyial laahul lazee nazzalal Kitaaba wa Huwa yatawallas saaliheenEnglish Translation:""Indeed, my protector is Allah, who has sent down the Book; and He is an ally to the righteous."" — (Qur'an 7:196)Reflection:The story of Prophet Yusuf draws many parallels to Prophet Muhammad (may peace be upon them). Both were separated from their parents early in their childhood. They faced harm from the people closest to them. Yusuf (as) brothers thought about killing him, and Abu Lahab opposed protecting his nephew and used to publicly humiliate him by casting rocks and leaving excrement at his door. Those closest to them failed to provide support. Aziz, who cared for Yusus (as), acted out in his self-interest betraying Yusuf, leading to his arrest and imprisonment. And how did they respond? They turned to Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ, the only true friend a person needs. Yusuf (as) made the du'a Anta waliyyee fid dunyaa, ""You are my protector in this world and in the Hereafter."" (Qur'an 12:101) They are not hurt by anyone or anything because they have no expectations of others. They believe all matters are in Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ care. If you turn to Him in pleasing ways, He will grant you care and protection. It may not be as you want it to be, but trust Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ knows best.For a second, imagine what it would feel like to be part of an inner circle of a kind King or someone of immense worldly success; you would be grateful for being in such a lucky position. You wouldn't want to break the trust and confidence that person has in you. Similarily, the believer benefits in knowing that Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Wali. He has not left any of His believers stranded. He is the best friend anyone could ask for. He's the source of true success in this life and the next. We should engage in activities beloved by Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ that would raise our ranks within the inner circle of believers to try and grow nearer to Him. إِنَّهُمۡ لَن يُغۡنُواْ عَنكَ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ شَيۡـٔٗاۚ وَإِنَّ ٱلظَّـٰلِمِينَ بَعۡضُهُمۡ أَوۡلِيَآءُ بَعۡضٖۖ وَٱللَّهُ وَلِيُّ ٱلۡمُتَّقِينَInnahum lany yughnoo ‘anka minal laahi shai'aa; wa innaz zaalimeena ba'duhum awliyaaa'u ba'dinw wallaahu waliyyul muttaqeenEnglish Translation:""Indeed, they will never avail you against Allah at all. And indeed, the wrongdoers are allies of one another; but Allah is the protector of the righteous."" — (Qur'an 45:19)References:[1] Sahih al-Bukhari 6502 & Hadith #38 an-Nawawi"
الْحَمِيدُ,Al-Hameed / Al-Hamid,The Praiseworthy,"The Praiseworthy, The Laudable one.","Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Hameed (in Arabic: ٱلْحَمِيدُ), meaning the one worthy of praise. He qualifies as the praiseworthy one because of all His attributes and because He has given us what we have. He is the only one deserving in every manner of praise, and He should be exalted. Join in extolling him by repeating 'al-hamdu lillah, meaning 'praise be to Allah.'","From the root ha-mim-dal (ح م د), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to praise, to laud with deep feelings of adoration and submission to praise one for something done by that one's own will to speak well of, honor, commend to eulogize.","Arabic Root:From the root ha-mim-dal (ح م د), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to praise, to laud with deep feelings of adoration and submission to praise one for something done by that one's own will to speak well of, honor, commend to eulogize.Connecting this name with Surah Fatiha:In the first two ayat of the Qur'an, it is written, Bismillah hir rahman nir raheem, Alhamdu lillaahi Rabbil 'aalameen note the word, Al-hamd meaning, ""[All] praise and thanks"" and continues lillaahi ""be to Allah."" It then goes onto list several reasons why:(1) Rabbil 'aalameen - He is the ""Lord of the worlds""(2) Ar-Rahmaan - He is ""The Entirely Merciful""(3) Ar-Raheem - He is ""the Especially Merciful""(4) Maaliki Yawmid-Deen - He is ""The Master [Ruling judge] of the Day of Recompense.""This affirms Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ as being Al-Hameed (the praiseworthy one) and the natural response to such a realization would be Iyyaaka na'budu wa lyyaaka nasta'een ""It is You we worship and You we ask for help.""From Surah Fatiha, we understand it is Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ who's the source of all gifts. He's the Lord of the worlds, giving us life and intellect. He's surrounded us with beauty and love. He is the ruling judge on the day of recompense, but Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ prefaced this first by telling us that He is Ar-Rahman and Ar-Raheem - The Most Beneficent and The Most Merciful. Hence, He is the all-praiseworthy. We should feel the weight behind the words we speak. For example, in saying alhamdulillah, we recognize that He alone is worthy of all praise. Through our words and actions, we praise Him, and if we are mindful of the reason behind the words we say as we say them, we can't help but be overcome with gratitude.Al-Hameed is mentioned throughout the Qur'an 17 times, and we'll examine a few ayat to further understand this attribute. يَـٰٓأَيُّهَا  ٱلَّذِينَ  ءَامَنُوٓاْ  أَنفِقُواْ  مِن  طَيِّبَٰتِ  مَا  كَسَبۡتُمۡ  وَمِمَّآ  أَخۡرَجۡنَا  لَكُم  مِّنَ  ٱلۡأَرۡضِۖ  وَلَا  تَيَمَّمُواْ  ٱلۡخَبِيثَ  مِنۡهُ  تُنفِقُونَ  وَلَسۡتُم  بِـَٔاخِذِيهِ  إِلَّآ  أَن  تُغۡمِضُواْ  فِيهِۚ  وَٱعۡلَمُوٓاْ  أَنَّ  ٱللَّهَ  غَنِيٌّ  حَمِيدٌYaaa 'ayyuhal lazeena aamanooo anfiqoo min taiyibaati maa kasabtum wa mimmaaa akhrajna lakum minal ardi wa laa tayammamul khabeesa minhu tunfiqoona wa lastum bi aakhizeehi illaaa an tughmidoo feeh; wa'lamooo annal laaha Ghaniyyun HameedEnglish Translation:""O you who have believed, spend from the good things which you have earned and from that which We have produced for you from the earth.

And know that Allah is Free of need and Praiseworthy."" — (Qur'an 2:267) ٱلَّذِينَ يَبۡخَلُونَ وَيَأۡمُرُونَ ٱلنَّاسَ بِٱلۡبُخۡلِۗ وَمَن يَتَوَلَّ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ هُوَ ٱلۡغَنِيُّ ٱلۡحَمِيدُAllazeeena yabkhaloona wa yaamuroonan naasa bil bukhl; wa many yatawalla fa innal laaha Huwal Ghaniyyul HameedEnglish Translation:""[Those] who are stingy and enjoin upon people stinginess.

It allows for a holistic understanding giving further insight into who Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is. For example, we have Al-Ghaniyy (The Self-Sufficient - coupled 10 times), Al-Azeez (The Mighty one - 3 times), Al-Hakim, Al-Majid, and Al-Wali (The Wise, The Glorious, and The Patron - each paired 1 time).In the previous verses, we see the pairing of Al-Ghaniyy (The Self-Sufficient One) with Al-Hameed. Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ would be worthy of praise even if no one existed. Imam al-Ghazali writes that Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is ""Praised by the virtue of His praise of Himself from eternity."" He is self-sufficient and free from the need of praise. We praise Him because we are in need. Ibn Arabi wrote in his book, ""He is His own praiser, the one who praises Himself [...] This is the height of generosity (karam): first, He gives you, and then He Praises you for what He has given you."" This is analogous to how we often know the creator and praise them for their inventions. They are beloved and become heroes in some sense, prime example is Elon Musk. The creator of the universe, the master inventor is Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. This should shape our behavior to praise Him even though He does not need it for His sustenance. لَّا يَأۡتِيهِ ٱلۡبَٰطِلُ مِنۢ بَيۡنِ يَدَيۡهِ وَلَا مِنۡ خَلۡفِهِۦۖ تَنزِيلٞ مِّنۡ حَكِيمٍ حَمِيدٖLaa yaateehil baatilu mim baini yadaihi wa laa min khalfihee tanzeelum min Hakeemin HameedEnglish Translation:""Falsehood cannot approach it from before it or from behind it; [it is] a revelation from a [Lord who is] Wise and Praiseworthy."" — (Qur'an 41:42) وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِي يُنَزِّلُ ٱلۡغَيۡثَ مِنۢ بَعۡدِ مَا قَنَطُواْ وَيَنشُرُ رَحۡمَتَهُۥۚ وَهُوَ ٱلۡوَلِيُّ ٱلۡحَمِيدُWa Huwal lazee yunazzilul ghaisa min ba'di maa qanatoo wa yanshuru rahmatah; wa Huwal Waliyyul HameedEnglish Translation:""And it is He who sends down the rain after they had despaired and spreads His mercy. And He is the Protector, the Praiseworthy."" — (Qur'an 42:28)Exploring Al-Hakeem/Al-Waliyy and Al-Hamid:In these verses, it mentions Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ as Al-Waliyy (The Protecting Associate). Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ gives people what they need, when they need it. He ""sends down rain after they had despaired and spreads His mercy."" In the ayah, rain is said as symbolic of nourishment or, as other commentators interpret it, spiritual or divine inspiration. We understand whatever is decreed by Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ there is wisdom in it. We may not understand it, and we don't necessarily need to. The veil may be lifted with the passage of time to see the blessings in some of our hardships. But regardless of what happens, remain dutiful to Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ, and be patient because whatever He has ordered will ultimately be for their benefit.Dealing with a tragedy:The pairing of names helps us to see that Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Hameed (worthy of praise) in all circumstances. That's why even in the darkest moments, we say alhamdulillah. One of the most painful experiences any human can go through is the loss of a child. Abu Musa Al-Ash'ari (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, ""When a servant's child dies, Allah, the Most High asks His angels, 'Have you taken out the life of the child of My servant?"" They reply in the affirmative. He then asks, 'Have you taken the fruit of his heart?' They reply in the affirmative. Thereupon he asks, 'What has My servant said?' They say: 'He has praised You and said: Inna lillahi wa inna ilaihi raji'un (We belong to Allah and to Him we shall be returned). Allah says: 'Build a house for My servant in Jannah and name it as Bait-ul-Hamd (the House of Praise).""'[1]From the hadith, there is another story that exemplifies the best way a believer responds to tragedy. It is the story of Umm Sulaym (ra) and the loss of her child. She was one of the first Muslim women converts, and as we'll shortly see, she was a courageous, emotionally strong, and intelligent woman. She did things in a manner to please Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ.Narrated by Anas bin malik: Abu Talha had a child who was sick. [Abu Talhah was upset and distressed by the child's sickness.) Once, while Abu Talha was out, the child died. [Umm Sulaym (the mother) washed the child, enshrouded him and laid him down. She said to the people in the house, “Do not tell his father that he died before I tell him.”] When Abu Talha returned home [along with some of his friends from the mosque], he asked, ""How is my child"" Umm Sulaym replied, ""He is quieter than he has ever been."" [Her husband took it to mean that the child's condition had improved.] [2]She brought the meal, and they all ate dinner [then the guests left.] [She got up and put on perfume and adorned herself,] [making herself more beautiful than she ever had before.] He slept with her, and when he finished [they slept, and when it was morning, he did ghusl (full ablution) and was heading to leave, so she said to him] [“O Abu Talhah, do you think that if some people lent something to some others, then they asked for it back, do they have the right not to give it back?” He said, “No.”] [They should return it to them] [She said, “Allah Almighty, lent your son to you, and now He has taken him back, so seek reward with Him and have patience.”] She said: ""Bury the child (as he's dead).""[He became angry and said, “You left me until I did what I did, then you tell me that my son has died!”] [Then he said, “Innaa Lillaahi wa innaa ilayhi raaji'oon (Truly, to Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return) and praised Allah.] In the morning Abu Talha came to Allah's Messenger ﷺ and told him about that. The Prophet ﷺ said (to him), ""Did you sleep with your wife last night?"" Abu Talha said, ""Yes"". The Prophet ﷺ said, ""O Allah! Bestow your blessing on them as regards that night of theirs."" Umm Sulaym gave birth to a boy. Abu Talha told me to take care of the child till it was taken to the Prophet.Then Abu Talha took the child to the Prophet ﷺ [he found him smearing some camels with tar to protect them from diseases, or marking them] and Umm Sulaym sent some dates along with the child. The Prophet ﷺ took the child (on his lap) and asked if there was something with him. The people replied, ""Yes, a few dates."" The Prophet took a date, chewed it, took some of it out of his mouth, put it into the child's mouth and did Tahnik for him with that, and named him 'Abdullah. [There was no young man better than him among al-Ansar]Connecting your salat with this name:When reciting durood ibrahim we call upon these two names, Al-Hameed and Al-Majeed. Narrated Ka`b bin Ujra: It was said, ""O Allah's Messenger ﷺ We know how to greet you, but how to invoke Allah for you?"" The Prophet said, ""Say: Allahumma salli ala Muhammadin wa'ala `Ali Muhammaddin, kama sallaita 'ala all Ibrahim, innaka Hamidun Majid."" Meaning: ""O Allah, send your grace, honour and mercy upon Muhammad and upon the family of Muhammad, as You sent Your grace, honour and mercy upon Ibrahim, You are indeed Praiseworthy, Most Glorious."" [3]Reflection:The believer benefits from knowing that Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Hameed. If we introspect with this name, we ask ourselves how we can make ourselves worthy of praise - not in the sense of worship but admiration for our faith, character, or actions. What qualities must we possess to deserve respect from our peers, friends, or family?References:[1] Riyad as-Salihin 1395[2] Sahih Muslim 2144d & Sahih al-Bukhari 5470 | Combined narration from several sources, Bukhari, Muslim, al-Tayalisi, Musnad Ahmad, Sahih Ibn Haban[3] Sahih al-Bukhari 4797"
الْمُحْصِي,Al-Muhsi / Al-Muhsee,The All-Enumerating,"The Counter, The Reckoner, The One whose count of things is known to him.","The One who considers all things in the universe and knows the details of every moment or change. He comprehends everything and possesses all knowledge.

Of the 99 names, 81 are explicitly mentioned in the Qur'an. Therefore, you won't find Al-Muhsi recognized as an official name by certain scholars. This list includes Ibn Uthaymeen, Ibn Hazm, and Ibn Hajar, among others. However, others, such as Ibn Arabi, Imam al-Bayhaqi, and al-Ghazali, have included this name in their lists.Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying: There are ninety-nine names of Allah; he who commits them to memory would get into Paradise. Verily, Allah is Odd (He is one, and it is an odd number), and He loves odd numbers. And in the narration of Ibn Umar (the words are): ""He who enumerated them."" [1] In the hadith, it uses the word with the same root (أَحْصَا - ihsa), meaning computation of some kind. To enumerate or to count.What is meant by referring to Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ as the all-enumerating, the numberer, or the counter? It is an attribute of His knowledge, much like Al-Alim (The All-Knowing), Ash-Shaheed (The Witness), or Al-Khabir (The All-Acquainted). The difference is Al-Muhsi is often described more analytically. He has knowledge of all things. He takes into account each separate item and stores it in His ledger. Every breath inhaled and exhaled, every leaf that falls, and the movement of every atom is accounted for. Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ knowledge is infinite, He knows a thing through and through. Some commentators mention He knows all the things that are possible, for everything that is possible. So, He not only knows everything but knows what it could have been. He's calculated the infinite possibility of every choice, and the downstream effects caused. There is nothing unknown to Him سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. لِّيَعۡلَمَ أَن قَدۡ أَبۡلَغُواْ رِسَٰلَٰتِ رَبِّهِمۡ وَأَحَاطَ بِمَا لَدَيۡهِمۡ وَأَحۡصَىٰ كُلَّ شَيۡءٍ عَدَدَۢاLiya'lama an qad ablaghoo risaalaati rabbihim wa ahaata bi maa ladaihim wa ahsaa kulla shai'in 'adadaEnglish Translation:""That he may know that they have conveyed the messages of their Lord; and He has encompassed whatever is with them and has enumerated all things in number."" — (Qur'an 72:28) وَكُلَّ شَيۡءٍ أَحۡصَيۡنَٰهُ كِتَٰبٗاWa kulla shai-in ahsai naahu kitaa baEnglish Translation:""But all things We have enumerated in writing."" — (Qur'an 78:29)Counter of deeds: وَوُضِعَ ٱلۡكِتَٰبُ فَتَرَى ٱلۡمُجۡرِمِينَ مُشۡفِقِينَ مِمَّا فِيهِ وَيَقُولُونَ يَٰوَيۡلَتَنَا مَالِ هَٰذَا ٱلۡكِتَٰبِ لَا يُغَادِرُ صَغِيرَةٗ وَلَا كَبِيرَةً إِلَّآ أَحۡصَىٰهَاۚ وَوَجَدُواْ مَا عَمِلُواْ حَاضِرٗاۗ وَلَا يَظۡلِمُ رَبُّكَ أَحَدٗاWa wudi'al kitaabu fataral mujrimeena mushfiqeena mimmaa feehi wa yaqooloona yaa wailatanaa maa lihaazal kitaabi laa yughaadiru saghee ratanw wa laa kabeeratan illaaa ahsaahaa; wa wajadoo maa 'amiloo haadiraa; wa laa yazlimu Rabbuka ahadaa (Section 6)English Translation:""And the record [of deeds] will be placed [open], and you will see the criminals fearful of that within it, and they will say, ""Oh, woe to us!

And your Lord does injustice to no one."" — (Qur'an 18:49)The knower and bestower blessings: وَءَاتَىٰكُم مِّن كُلِّ مَا سَأَلۡتُمُوهُۚ وَإِن تَعُدُّواْ نِعۡمَتَ ٱللَّهِ لَا تُحۡصُوهَآۗ إِنَّ ٱلۡإِنسَٰنَ لَظَلُومٞ كَفَّارٞWa aataakum min kulli maa sa altumooh; wa in ta'uddoo ni'matal laahi laa tuhsoohaa; innal insaana lazaloo mun kaffaar (section 5)English Translation:""And He gave you from all you asked of Him. And if you should count the favor of Allah, you could not enumerate them. Indeed, mankind is [generally] most unjust and ungrateful."" — (Qur'an 14:34)From this ayah, we realize that we probably don't understand the extent of Allah's blessings. We're unable to count them all. If every reward or blessing required us to praise and exalt Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ we would fall short. We are forever indebted to His continuous favors, kindness, and mercy.The knower of all people: إِنَّا نَحۡنُ نُحۡيِ ٱلۡمَوۡتَىٰ وَنَكۡتُبُ مَا قَدَّمُواْ وَءَاثَٰرَهُمۡۚ وَكُلَّ شَيۡءٍ أَحۡصَيۡنَٰهُ فِيٓ إِمَامٖ مُّبِينٖInnaa Nahnu nuhyil mawtaa wa naktubu maa qaddamoo wa aasaarahum; wa kulla shai'in ahsainaahu feee Imaamim MubeenEnglish Translation:""Indeed, it is We who bring the dead to life and record what they have put forth and what they left behind, and all things We have enumerated in a clear register."" — (Qur'an 36:12) لِّلَّهِ  مَا  فِي  ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ  وَمَا  فِي  ٱلۡأَرۡضِۗ  وَإِن  تُبۡدُواْ  مَا  فِيٓ  أَنفُسِكُمۡ  أَوۡ  تُخۡفُوهُ  يُحَاسِبۡكُم  بِهِ  ٱللَّهُۖ  فَيَغۡفِرُ  لِمَن  يَشَآءُ  وَيُعَذِّبُ  مَن  يَشَآءُۗ  وَٱللَّهُ  عَلَىٰ  كُلِّ  شَيۡءٖ  قَدِيرٌLillaahi maa fissamaawaati wa maa fil ard; wa in tubdoo maa feee anfusikum aw tukhfoohu yuhaasibkum bihil laa; fayaghfiru li mai yashaaa'u wa yu'azzibu mai yashaaa u; wallaahu 'alaa kulli shai in qadeerEnglish Translation:""To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth. Whether you show what is within yourselves or conceal it, Allah will bring you to account for it. Then He will forgive whom He wills and punish whom He wills, and Allah is over all things competent."" — (Qur'an 2:284)Reflection:This name reminds us that Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ knows you and me. If you feel unheard, small, or not counted for, remember Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is and always has been watchful over you. We all matter to Him, and He has accounted for us and guided us to live fruitful lives. He has not forgotten anyone. He knows everyone that has walked this earth - past and present.In explaining each name, we try to find a way to connect the knowledge of the name to our everyday life. This often includes providing a reflection to consider how we can live and exemplify the same beautiful attributes to try and better ourselves. However, for the name Al-Muhsi, our access is limited. Awareness of this name is enough to have a meaningful impact in your life. Think of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ when confronted with a decision and ask what you believe would be most pleasing to Him.As a comparison to try and illustrate the scale at which Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ intimately knows every person, we examine our limited social networking abilities. It was proposed by an anthropologist named Robert Dunbar that the number of meaningful relationships we could make was capped by the size of our brain's neocortex size - that there's a natural limit to the number of friendships we could actively manage. His proposed number is coined as ""Dunbar's number"" and suggests we could hold about ~150 relationships (a meaningful relationship is informally defined as the number of people you would not feel awkward about joining for a coffee or some get-together). Now, every relationship is not made equal. Of these 150, only 5-10 may be your core support clique. You frequently interact, share bad news, and know what's happening in each other's lives. The second group may be 10 people you consider your close friends. The further out you go, the weaker the bond. Outside this 150+ boundary would be acquaintances - people you know but aren't in close contact with.Now, this number is disputed by some researchers - social sciences are not hard science. But the proposed number remains small (i.e., less than 400-500). Now, imagine the vastness and capability of Allah's knowledge when He tells us, ""And with Him are the keys of the unseen; none knows them except Him. And He knows what is on the land and in the sea. Not a leaf falls but that He knows it. And no grain is there within the darknesses of the earth and no moist or dry [thing] but that it is [written] in a clear record."" (Qur'an 6:59) He not only knows each of us by name but remembers our prayers, our deeds, and what we conceal in our hearts. This is the vastness and complete knowledge of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ and what is conveyed through the meaning of His name Al-Muhsi.References:[1] Sahih Muslim 2677a"
الْمُبْدِئُ,Al-Mubdi,The Originator,"The Originator, The Starter, The Initiator.","Allah is Al-Mubdi, the originator of all creation. He is the beginner of all things, and nothing could have existed without His willing it to be. He is The One who initiates all things.","From the root ba-dal-hamza (ب د أ), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to begin, create, make something new, to make something be first, have precedence, to contrive a new thing, to invent, to do first, to commence, start, be at the beginning.","Arabic Root:From the root ba-dal-hamza (ب د أ), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to begin, create, make something new, to make something be first, have precedence, to contrive a new thing, to invent, to do first, to commence, start, be at the beginning.Among the disputed names:As we've mentioned in previous names, different scholars have different criteria for what qualifies as a name of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. Of the 99 names, 81 are explicitly mentioned in the Qur'an. Therefore, there isn't one agreed-upon list for the remaining 18 names. Al-Mubdi is one of those names which is not included by certain scholars. This list includes Ibn Mandah, Ibn Hazm, and Ibn Hajar, among others. However, others, such as Ibn Arabi, Imam al-Bayhaqi, and al-Ghazali, have included this name in their lists.All things have a beginning, except Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. Allah is Al-Mubdi, the initiator. He is the one from which all things begin. This name is often mentioned in pairs, Al-Mubdi and Al-Mu'id (the restorer). The connection between the two names is the first creation represents the beginning, Al-Mubdi. There is nothing like it. It is unique and original. Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ creation is made from nothingness and without any model. When we build something, we're often taking inspiration or building on top of something that came before, that is said to be a restoration. The meaning of Al-Mu'id is the same, taking something prior and revitalizing it. Except for Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ can restore a thing from non-living back to life. We'll expand on the name Al-Mu'id in greater detail in the next section of the guide.Though the name Al-Mubdi is not mentioned in the Qur'an, many verses describe this quality of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. Instead, the Qur'an often mentions the two names in the verb form,  yub'di-u  (He originates) and  yu'idu  (regenerates). أَوَلَمۡ يَرَوۡاْ كَيۡفَ يُبۡدِئُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلۡخَلۡقَ ثُمَّ يُعِيدُهُۥٓۚ إِنَّ ذَٰلِكَ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ يَسِيرٞAwa lam yaraw kaifa yubdi'ul laahul khalqa summa yu'eeduh; inna zaalika 'alal laahi yaseerEnglish Translation: ""Have they not considered how Allah begins creation and then repeats it?

It is a reminder to the one who began everything. It is really easy to pass the time by being busy and going, going, going that we miss seeing the bigger picture. We see Allah's creation through the lens of permanence. We don't think about the fragility of life, and when we do, it's misinformed. We think He's created us on this planet, and when we die, we return to Him, the work of Al-Mubdi and Al-Mu'id. But in reality, in every moment, who is giving us existence? Do you drink from a magical elixir every morning that sustains you? The lifespan of a single skin cell. Its existence is short, lasting only two to four weeks. Every day we shed 50 million dead skin cells, which goes unnoticed. It is an illusion that these attributes of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ only serve us twice, at birth and on the day of qiyamah. But the truth is in every moment, we are being originated and returning to Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. This is the nature of Al-Mubdi and Al-Mu'id, who is continuously working.It's important to give ourselves some space, a much-needed break to pause and reflect. Technology is supposed to serve, not enslave. We don't need to distract ourselves every moment; let boredom and silence fill some time. See the beauty in Allah's creation - there is much entertainment there.Respect the gift of this moment given to you by Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. The choice is yours to squander it or make the deliberate effort to take the most from it - regardless of what is happening or has happened. Insha-Allah, when Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ restores us, we'll be able to say, look at all the good I've done, all the smiles on people's faces I left, the adherence to the guidance you've taught. That is what the ""good life"" looks like."
ٱلْمُعِيدُ,Al-Mu'id,The Restorer,"The Reproducer, The Restorer, The Renewer.","Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Mu'id (in Arabic: ٱلْمُعِيدُ), He is the restorer, the one who refashions a thing.

Of the 99 names, 81 are explicitly mentioned in the Qur'an. Therefore, there is not one agreed-upon list for the remaining 18 names. Al-Mu'id is one of those names which is not included by certain scholars. This list includes Ibn Mandah, Ibn Hazm, and Ibn Hajar, among others. However, others, such as Ibn Arabi, Imam al-Bayhaqi, and Al-Ghazali, have included this name in their lists. Al-Mubdi and Al'Mu'id:Al-Mu'id is often juxtaposed with the name Al-Mubdi (The Starter / The Originator). In this case, Al-Mu'id refers to the quality of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ as being able to restore. He is the starting point from which all creation begins, and we will be restored to Him. But as we discussed, the truth is in every moment, we are being originated while also being closer to returning to Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. This is the nature of Al-Mubdi and Al-Mu'id, who is present and continuously working in every moment. يَوۡمَ نَطۡوِي ٱلسَّمَآءَ كَطَيِّ ٱلسِّجِلِّ لِلۡكُتُبِۚ كَمَا بَدَأۡنَآ أَوَّلَ خَلۡقٖ نُّعِيدُهُۥۚ وَعۡدًا عَلَيۡنَآۚ إِنَّا كُنَّا فَٰعِلِينَYawma natwis samaaa'a kataiyis sijilli lilkutub; kamaa bada'naa awwala khalqin nu'eeduh; wa'dan 'alainaa; innaa kunna faa'ileenEnglish Translation: ""The Day when We will fold the heaven like the folding of a [written] sheet for the records.

Indeed that, for Allah, is easy."" — (Qur'an 29:19)Reflection:The meaning of this name has been covered more extensively in our exploration of the name  Al-Mubdi. There is one additional comment that can be made here: a believer should think about life and death, but he/she shouldn't worry about it. The Prophet ﷺ said,  ""None of you should wish for death because of a calamity befalling him; but if he has to wish for death, he should say: ""O Allah! Keep me alive as long as life is better for me, and let me die if death is better for me.'  [1] Of course, this is easier said than done. But the attitude we should have is to fix our focus and direct it towards Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. It's the only thing that matters and is within our control. We can always work towards restoring our faith to rewrite our wrongs. If you've been making the same mistake for the past five years, change it so you don't make it for the next five. You're not a tree, you're capable of change, and the pathways to Jannah are many.الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ الَّذِي عَافَانِي فِي جَسَدِي وَرَدَّ عَلَيَّ رُوحِي وَأَذِنَ لِي بِذِكْرِهِAl-hamdu lillahil-ladhi afani fi jasadi, wa radda `alayya ruji, wa 'adhina li bidhikrihi.English Translation: ""Praise is to Allah Who gave strength to my body and returned my soul to me and permitted me to remember Him.""

His essence is to be alive, never deteriorating, and not derived from any source. The name Al-Muhyi describes His nature of not only being the living but the one who gives life to His creation so that they may glorify and praise Him.No verse in the Qur'an mentions this name, but there are close derivatives and other verses that describe this attribute: كَيۡفَ  تَكۡفُرُونَ  بِٱللَّهِ  وَكُنتُمۡ  أَمۡوَٰتٗا  فَأَحۡيَٰكُمۡۖ  ثُمَّ  يُمِيتُكُمۡ  ثُمَّ  يُحۡيِيكُمۡ  ثُمَّ  إِلَيۡهِ  تُرۡجَعُونَKaifa takfuroona billaahi wa kuntum amwaatan fa ahyaakum summa yumeetukum summa yuhyeekum summaa ilaihi turja'oonEnglish Translation:""How can you disbelieve in Allah when you were lifeless and He brought you to life; then He will cause you to die, then He will bring you [back] to life, and then to Him you will be returned."" — (Qur'an 2:28) قُلۡ يَـٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّاسُ إِنِّي رَسُولُ ٱللَّهِ إِلَيۡكُمۡ جَمِيعًا ٱلَّذِي لَهُۥ مُلۡكُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلۡأَرۡضِۖ لَآ إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ يُحۡيِۦ وَيُمِيتُۖ فَـَٔامِنُواْ بِٱللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ ٱلنَّبِيِّ ٱلۡأُمِّيِّ ٱلَّذِي يُؤۡمِنُ بِٱللَّهِ وَكَلِمَٰتِهِۦ وَٱتَّبِعُوهُ لَعَلَّكُمۡ تَهۡتَدُونَQul yaaa aiyuhan naasu innee Rasoolul laahi ilaikum jamee'anil lazee lahoo mulkus samaawaati wal ardi laaa ilaaha illaa Huwa yuhyee wa yumeetu fa aaminoo billaahi wa Rasoolihin Nabiyyil ummiy yil lazee yu'minu billaahi wa Kalimaatihee wattabi'oohu la'allakum tahtadoonEnglish Translation:""Say, [O Muhammad], “O mankind, indeed I am the Messenger of Allah to you all, [from Him] to whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth.

It reminds us that Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ chooses you to be alive. He gave us all the gifts of life to enjoy its ups and downs. Nothing He creates is by accident or mistake. He is Ahsanul Khaliqeen, the best of creators. He also did not create us aimlessly; He provided His book for guidance so that we may choose Him, just as He chose us. Yes, no doubt every person will face many kinds of fitnahs (i.e., tests or adversities), fitnah of the heart, money, and in our families. For some, these trials will be small and private. For others, they may be big and public. But rest assured, ""Allah does not burden any human being with a responsibility heavier than he can bear."" (Qur'an 2:286) Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ gifted us with strength and intellect. He's given us the ability to think and reason, to seek and find. So whatever you fear facing, know that Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ has made you capable and equipped to handle all of life's various challenges. Just like the last big problem you faced and no longer worry about, this too will fade with time.Narrated Anas: The Prophet ﷺ said, ""O Allah!

اَلْمُمِيتُ,Al-Mumit/Al-Mumeet,The Inflicter of Death,"The Slayer, The Bringer of Death, The Life-Taker.","Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Mumeet (in Arabic: ٱلْمُمِيتُ), meaning the one who gives life and the one who takes it away. He ordains who will become lifeless. Eventually, we all return to Him.","From the root mim-waw-ta (م و ت), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to die, pass away, burn out, be lifeless, to be quiet, still, calm, to be inanimate, to be deprived of sensation, to be spiritually dead, lacking spiritual life.","Arabic Root:From the root mim-waw-ta (م و ت), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to die, pass away, burn out, be lifeless, to be quiet, still, calm, to be inanimate, to be deprived of sensation, to be spiritually dead, lacking spiritual life.Among the disputed names:As we've mentioned prior, different scholars have different criteria for what qualifies as a name of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. Of the 99 names, 81 are explicitly mentioned in the Qur'an. Therefore, there is not one agreed-upon list for the remaining 18 names. Al-Mumeet is one of those names which is not included by certain scholars. This list includes Ibn al-Wazir, Ibn Hazm, and Ibn al-Uthaymeen, among others. However, others, such as Ibn Arabi, Imam al-Bayhaqi, and al-Ghazali, have included this name in their lists.The pairing of Al-Muhyi and Al-Mumeet:The names Al-Muhyi and Al-Mumeet are often mentioned together for their contrasting nature. Al-Muhyi is the bestower of life, and Al-Mumeet is the bringer of death. These two attributes are not shared with anyone and are reserved for Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ alone.Al-Muhyi and Al-Mumeet are necessary as they bring balance to all things. If we lived as if we were immortal, we would be more likely overtaken by the temptations of this world with fear of no consequences. But the knowledge of our mortality softens many emotions and balances us out. We should have no reason to fear death; death is a gift to the believer. Because of this constraint, we rush to do good, seek Allah's forgiveness, and offer our daily prayers. The duality of life and death is created by Al-Muhyi and Al-Mumeet, which maintains this essential balance. وَمَا ٱلۡحَيَوٰةُ ٱلدُّنۡيَآ إِلَّا لَعِبٞ وَلَهۡوٞۖ وَلَلدَّارُ ٱلۡأٓخِرَةُ خَيۡرٞ لِّلَّذِينَ يَتَّقُونَۚ أَفَلَا تَعۡقِلُونَWa mal hayaatud dunyaaa illaa la'ibunw wa lahwunw wa lad Daarul Aakhiratu khaiyrul lillazeena yattaqoon; afalaa ta'qiloonEnglish Translation:""And the worldly life is not but amusement and diversion; but the home of the Hereafter is best for those who fear Allah, so will you not reason?"" — (Qur'an 6:32)Death is not non-existence:These verses from the Qur'an do not include the name Al-Mumeet but help us understand the quality of being called the slayer. ""Abdallah b. Amr reported God's Messenger ﷺ as saying: 'The gift to a believer is death.' (i.e., death is the means by which he gains an introduction to the delights of paradise.)"" [1] Death is a state of being for living things. It does not mean non-existence or nothingness. It exists as another state from which our lives transcend. Some scholars have commented on how we live many lives. But they are all connected, one continuous life compartmentalized into distinct phases. We have the life of this world (hayat al dunya), life of the grave (hayat al qabr), life of the interworld (hayat al barzakh), the life of the day resurrection (hayat al qiyamah), and the final destination the life of the hereafter (hayat al akhirah). وَلِكُلِّ أُمَّةٍ أَجَلٞۖ فَإِذَا جَآءَ أَجَلُهُمۡ لَا يَسۡتَأۡخِرُونَ سَاعَةٗ وَلَا يَسۡتَقۡدِمُونَWa likulli ummatin ajalun fa izaa jaaa'a ajaluhum laa yasta' khiroona saa'atanw wa laa yastaqdimoonEnglish Translation:""And for every nation is a [specified] term.

Amr b. al-'As reported: I heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying: Allah ordained the measures (of quality) of the creation fifty thousand years before He created the heavens and the earth, as His Throne was upon water. [2] لَهُۥ مُلۡكُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلۡأَرۡضِۖ يُحۡيِۦ وَيُمِيتُۖ وَهُوَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيۡءٖ قَدِيرٌLahoo mulkus samaawaati wal ardi yuhyee wa yumeetu wa Huwa 'alaa kulli shai'in QadeerEnglish Translation:""His is the dominion of the heavens and earth.

Keep me alive as long as life is better for me, and let me die if death is better for me.'"" [3]Reflection:The Prophet ﷺ tells us to avoid making statements that shows displeasure with the decree of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. We should avoid jokingly or sarcastically saying, ""I would like nothing more than to just die."" Instead, we are told of the rewards that are offered to the believer who is patient when tragedy strikes. (1) Expiation of His or Her sins.  [4] (2) Those who are patient for the sake of Allah in anticipation of receiving his mercy and blessings will be rewarded. [5] هُوَ يُحۡيِۦ وَيُمِيتُ وَإِلَيۡهِ تُرۡجَعُونَHuwa yuhyee wa yumeetu wa ilaihi turja'oonEnglish Translation:""He gives life and causes death, and to Him you will be returned"" — (Qur'an 10:56)Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is the one who gives (Al-Muhyi) and takes (Al-Mumeet). To Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ belong all things when He causes them to return - He is retrieving what was rightfully His. In The Name & The Named, it mentions how the human body is made from a combination of flesh and soul. The flesh is visible; the soul is not. The body is temporal (short-lasting), whereas the soul is eternal. The book provides a useful conceptualization: the soul with its body is like a merchant who buys and sells goods, making gains and losses. When the soul parts from the body, it's like the business which no longer serves its owner. When we die, we are left with whatever profit or debt we have incurred. In the grave, we wait for the day of judgment, either bankrupt or rich. إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عِندَهُۥ عِلۡمُ ٱلسَّاعَةِ وَيُنَزِّلُ ٱلۡغَيۡثَ وَيَعۡلَمُ مَا فِي ٱلۡأَرۡحَامِۖ وَمَا تَدۡرِي نَفۡسٞ مَّاذَا تَكۡسِبُ غَدٗاۖ وَمَا تَدۡرِي نَفۡسُۢ بِأَيِّ أَرۡضٖ تَمُوتُۚ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلِيمٌ خَبِيرُۢInnal laaha indahoo 'ilmus saa'ati wa yunazzilul ghaisa wa ya'lamu maa fil arhaami wa maa tadree nafsum maazaa taksibu ghadaa; wa maa tadree nafsum bi ayyi ardin tamoot; innal laaha 'Aleemun Khabeer (section 4)English Translation:""Indeed, Allah [alone] has knowledge of the Hour and sends down the rain and knows what is in the wombs. And no soul perceives what it will earn tomorrow, and no soul perceives in what land it will die. Indeed, Allah is Knowing and Acquainted."" — (Qur'an 31:34)Usamah bin Zaid (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: A daughter of the Prophet ﷺ sent a message to him that her son was at his last breath and requested him to come to her. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ sent back the informer saying: ""To Allah belongs what He takes and what He gives, and everything has a limited period (in this world). So ask her to endure patiently, and expect the reward of Allah."" [6]Du'a calling on this attribute of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ:Abu Ayyub Al-Ansari narrated that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “Whoever says ten times: (reciting the du'a below) it is for him equal to freeing four slaves among the offspring of Isma'il.”اَ إِلَهَ إِلاَّ اللَّهُ وَحْدَهُ لاَ شَرِيكَ لَهُ لَهُ الْمُلْكُ وَلَهُ الْحَمْدُ يُحْيِي وَيُمِيتُ وَهُوَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌLa ilaha illallah, wahdahu la sharika lahu, lahul-mulku wa lahul-hamdu, yuhyi wa yumitu wa huwa 'ala kulli shai'in qadirEnglish Translation:""None has the right to be worshipped but Allah alone, Who has no partner.

(1) It Has already been mentioned and discussed extensively throughout the previous names; it's Allah's essence or quality of being everlasting. (2) The second layer is the perfection of His life. (3) The third quality is being the source of life.What is life?The word Hayy comes from hayaat which means life. One of the criteria of life as we know it is to have perception. Imam al-Ghazali says, ""The lowest level of perception involves the one perceiving being conscious of itself."" Plants are said to be alive since they detect and orient themselves toward the sunlight. Living things are also defined by their ability to respond purposefully to what they perceive. But all living things are limited in their scope of activity and perception. We operate within narrowly defined limits set by the creator. And Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ in His infinite wisdom has given life to a diverse range of creations which vary in these two qualities of perception and activity. An example Shaykh Tosun Bayrak mentions is how a plant is superior to the soil or rock since it's given the faculties to eat, drink and propagate. Life in animals is more developed with hearing, seeing, and moving. And so naturally, animals learn to dominate over vegetation. Human life is said to be the highest form of Allah's creation. We can store what we perceive and use our intellect, reasoning, and free will to respond with this information. We can act consciously based on our knowledge. This quality seems to be lacking in animals who only respond to their desires and stimuli. People differ in their ""aliveness,"" which is often a function of their knowledge and actions.What it means for Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ to be living:Now, when the word hayy is used as a name of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ it shows how He is aware of all things. Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is the most perceptive. He is As-Sami (The All-Hearing) and Al-Baseer (The All-Seeing). There is nothing that escapes His knowledge as He is aware of all activity. In this sense, it can be said He is the absolutely living. This transcends all creation, not just in the sense of being everlasting, but in terms of what it means to be perfect in living. His life is perfection; it is not touched by sickness, weakness, or any deficiency. Absence does not precede Him, nor does death follow after Him. In Surah Baqarah verse 255 (Ayatul Kursi), Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ says: ٱللَّهُ  لَآ  إِلَٰهَ  إِلَّا  هُوَ  ٱلۡحَيُّ  ٱلۡقَيُّومُۚ  لَا  تَأۡخُذُهُۥ  سِنَةٞ  وَلَا  نَوۡمٞۚ  لَّهُۥ  مَا  فِي  ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ  وَمَا  فِي  ٱلۡأَرۡضِۗ  مَن  ذَا  ٱلَّذِي  يَشۡفَعُ  عِندَهُۥٓ  إِلَّا  بِإِذۡنِهِۦۚ  يَعۡلَمُ  مَا  بَيۡنَ  أَيۡدِيهِمۡ  وَمَا  خَلۡفَهُمۡۖ  وَلَا  يُحِيطُونَ  بِشَيۡءٖ  مِّنۡ  عِلۡمِهِۦٓ  إِلَّا  بِمَا  شَآءَۚ  وَسِعَ  كُرۡسِيُّهُ  ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ  وَٱلۡأَرۡضَۖ  وَلَا  يَـُٔودُهُۥ  حِفۡظُهُمَاۚ  وَهُوَ  ٱلۡعَلِيُّ  ٱلۡعَظِيمُAllahu laaa ilaaha illaa Huwal Haiyul Qaiyoom; laa taakhuzuhoo sinatunw wa laa nawm; lahoo maa fissamaawaati wa maa fil ard; man zal lazee yashfa'u indahooo illaa bi-iznih; ya'lamu maa baina aydeehim wa maa khalfahum wa laa yuheetoona bishai'im min ‘ilmihee illaa bimaa shaaa'; wasi'a Kursiyyuhus samaawaati wal arda wa laa Ya'ooduhoo hifzuhumaa; wa Huwal Aliyyul ‘AzeemEnglish Translation:""Allah - there is no deity except Him, the Ever-Living, the Sustainer of [all] existence.

His Kursi extends over the heavens and the earth, and their preservation tires Him not. And He is the Most High, the Most Great."" — (Qur'an 2:255)This is just one of five verses in the Qur'an where the name Al-Hayy is mentioned. ٱللَّهُ لَآ إِلَـٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ ٱلْحَىُّ ٱلْقَيُّومُAllaahu laaa ilaaha illaa Huwal Haiyul QaiyoomEnglish Translation:""Allah - there is no deity except Him, the Ever-Living, the Sustainer of existence."" — (Qur'an 3:2) وَعَنَتِ ٱلْوُجُوهُ لِلْحَىِّ ٱلْقَيُّومِ ۖ وَقَدْ خَابَ مَنْ حَمَلَ ظُلْمًۭاWa ‘anatil wujoohu lil Haiiyil Qaiyoomi wa qad khaaba man hamala zulmaaEnglish Translation:""And [all] faces will be humbled before the Ever-Living, the Sustainer of existence.

[All] praise is [due] to Allah, Lord of the worlds."" — (Qur'an 40:65)Allah's greatest name?Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ essence is living. He is the one responsible for all creation. There would be no life without His willingness to allow it. So we recognize Him as being the only source we should turn to and rely upon for our sustenance. In fact, whenever the Prophet ﷺ was stressed, He used to call upon the two names, Ya Hayyu, Ya Qayyum (i.e., the subsisting, the self-sustaining).Anas bin Malik said: ""Whenever a matter would distress him, the Prophet (ﷺ) would say: 'O Living, O Self-Sustaining Sustainer! In Your Mercy do I seek relief (Ya hayyu ya Qayyum, bi-rahmatika astaghith).'” And with this chain, that he said: ""The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'Be constant with: ""O Possessor of Majesty and Honor (Ya Dhal-Jalali wal-Ikram).'"" [1]Another hadith mentions a second du'a which includes reciting these two names. Narrated Anas ibn Malik: I was sitting with the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and a man was offering prayer. He then made supplication: O Allah, I ask Thee by virtue of the fact that praise is due to Thee, there is no deity but Thou, Who showest favour and beneficence, the Originator of the Heavens and the earth, O Lord of Majesty and Splendour, O Living One (ya hayyu), O Eternal One (ya-qayyum). The Prophet ﷺ then said: He has supplicated Allah using His Greatest Name, when supplicated by this name, He answers, and when asked by this name He gives.[2]It is inferred from the last hadith that the greatest names of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ may be Al-Hayy and Al-Qayyum. This is consistent with another narration by Al-Qasim, who said: The Greatest Name of Allah, if He is called by which He will respond, is in three Surah: Al-Baqarah, Al-Imran and Ta-Ha. (Hasan) Another chain for something similar from Al-Qasim, from Abu Umamah, from the Prophet (ﷺ). [3] Al-Hayy and Al-Qayyum are both found in those surahs mentioned. There is another view that Allah may be the greatest name of all, and the case for that is because it is mentioned 2698 times throughout the Qur'an, way more than any other name.Regardless, it is not a worthwhile pursuit to view the names of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ as being hierarchical and trying to determine their rank. Instead, we should follow the advice given in the Qur'an, ""And to Allah belong the best names, so invoke Him by them"" (Qur'an 7:180).Similarly, we should try not to rank Allah's creation to feel superior. If Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ had given you the gift of knowledge like He had given Prophet Sulaiman (as) turn that awareness into gratitude and praise Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ that learning and studying comes easier to you than others. In the Qur'an, ""And We had certainly given to David and Solomon knowledge, and they said, 'Praise [is due] to Allah, who has favored us over many of His believing servants.'"" (Qur'an 27:15) We can't be particularly proud of gifts, they are from Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. We should only be proud of the choices we make in how we use those gifts.The main takeaway from the hadith is that invoking these names in our du'a can hold extra weight or reward for the believer. Especially when said in a time of distress when you need Him the most.Life after the death of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ:There is an important message in the Qur'an and hadith. You can imagine after the death of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, some people whose faith hadn't been fully nourished yet felt disconnected. They listened to Prophet Muhamamd for his leadership and guidance, and when he returned to Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ they felt lost. Surah al-Imran ayah 144 reminds all of us, ""Muhammad is not but a messenger. [Other] messengers have passed on before him. So if he was to die or be killed, would you turn back on your heels [to unbelief]?"" Abu Bakr (the first caliphate to succeed Prophet Muhammad ﷺ) came to His funeral prayerNarrated Aisha (ra): Abu Bakr came riding his horse from his dwelling place in As-Sunh. He got down from it, entered the Mosque and did not speak with anybody till he came to me and went direct to the Prophet, who was covered with a marked blanket. Abu Bakr uncovered his face. He knelt down and kissed him and then started weeping and said, ""My father and my mother be sacrificed for you, O Allah's Prophet! Allah will not combine two deaths on you. You have died the death which was written for you."" Narrated Abu Salama from Ibn Abbas: Abu Bakr came out and Umar, was addressing the people, and Abu Bakr told him to sit down but Umar refused. Abu Bakr again told him to sit down but Umar again refused. Then Abu Bakr recited the Tashah-hud (i.e. none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is Allah's Messenger ﷺ and the people attended to Abu Bakr and left Umar. Abu Bakr said, ""Amma ba'du, whoever amongst you worshipped Muhammad, then Muhammad is dead, but whoever worshipped Allah, Allah is alive (Al-hayy) and will never die. [here ayah 3:144 was recited] (The narrator added, ""By Allah, it was as if the people never knew that Allah had revealed this verse before till Abu Bakr recited it and then whoever heard it, started reciting it."") [4]This can be a very instructive lesson for parents with children. In the same sense, they are guardians/leaders over their children, teaching them Islam just as the Prophet ﷺ taught the sahabah. Sometimes children don't understand or become disconnected from the fact that worship is for Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ and not for seeking parental approval - or in some cases, avoiding parental punishment. Once the parent passes away or if the children grow up, get married and move away, they should remember that it is Al-Hayy, the ever-living, that they're seeking approval from.Reflection:Many go through life at the whims of their impulses and desires. The one who is truly alive is the one who tames himself. His life belongs to himself, and he is not a slave to whatever the controlling force of the time may be. The truly living are the ones who are in constant remembrance of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. For them will be granted eternal paradise in the hereafter.References:[1] Hasan (Darussalam) Jami at-Tirmidhi 3524[2] Sahih (Al-Albani) Sunan Abi Dawud 1495[3] Hasan (Darussalam) Jami at-Tirmidhi 3524[4] Sahih al-Bukhari 1241"
الْقَيُّومُ,Al-Qayyum / Al-Qayyoom,The Sustainer,"The Self-Subsisting, The Self-Existing.","Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Qayyum (in Arabic: ٱلْقَيُّومُ), His essence/nature is to exist being utterly free from dependence on anything or anyone. Al-Qayyum is the one through whom all things arise. He is Ever-Living and Self-Sustaining. Everything else in existence depends on Al-Qayyum.","From the root qaf-waw-mim (ق و م), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to stand up, to rise up, to ascend, become high, to begin, to start, to come, to pass, to arise, to set out, to be on-going, to exist, to be founded, to be built on, to undertake, to carry out, to manage, to make aright, straighten out, accurate, exact, to make righteous, upright.","Arabic Root:From the root qaf-waw-mim (ق و م), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to stand up, to rise up, to ascend, become high, to begin, to start, to come, to pass, to arise, to set out, to be on-going, to exist, to be founded, to be built on, to undertake, to carry out, to manage, to make aright, straighten out, accurate, exact, to make righteous, upright.The pairing Al-Hayy and Al-Qayyum:The name of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ Al-Qayyum, He is the one who is self-existing. Three verses in the Qur'an include the name Al-Qayyum, and it always occurs in pairs with the name Al-Hayy (the living). Together these names show the attribute of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ being independent and sovereign. He is ever-living not because some source enables Him but because of His essence of self-sustaining / self-subsisting. In contrast, all life remains dependent on one thing or another. They require proper living conditions, which include specific temperatures, the correct atmospheric pressure, composition, and dependence on many other elements. There is no one but Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ that can exist without truly needing anything from anyone. All things in existence rely upon Him for their being. ٱللَّهُ لَآ إِلَـٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ ٱلْحَىُّ ٱلْقَيُّومُAllaahu laaa ilaaha illaa Huwal Haiyul QaiyoomEnglish Translation:""Allah - there is no deity except Him, the Ever-Living, the Sustainer of existence."" — (Qur'an 3:2) وَعَنَتِ ٱلْوُجُوهُ لِلْحَىِّ ٱلْقَيُّومِ ۖ وَقَدْ خَابَ مَنْ حَمَلَ ظُلْمًۭاWa 'anatil wujoohu lil Haiiyil Qaiyoomi wa qad khaaba man hamala zulmaaEnglish Translation:""And [all] faces will be humbled before the Ever-Living, the Sustainer of existence.

And He is the Most High, the Most Great."" — (Qur'an 2:255)Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ - The Provider:There is another understood meaning of Al-Qayyum: He is the one who holds upright or causes to stand up. This connotates a sense of dependence, He not only is self-sustaining but is the sustainer. For example, qa'im (قايم) or qaimatun (قَائِمَةٌ) is an Arabic name/word for standing, rising, or being upright. Al-Qayyum is the more emphatic derivative containing the same root q-w-m. And in Surah Ar-Ra'd ayah 33 it mentions, Afaman Huwa qaaa'imun 'alaa kulli nafsim bimaa kasabat meaning, ""Is then He (Allah) Who takes charge (guards, maintains, provides, etc.) of every person and knows all that he has earned (like any other deities who know nothing)?"" Whether we realize it or not, we're all being upheld by the willingness and command of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. He is the maintainer who 'guards, protects, and provides.A man's duty:The word Qayoom also shares the same root of the word qawama, a concept of survival and subsistence. This topic has become controversial because it plays into gender politics. The verse which is viewed with scrutiny comes from Surah Nisa ayah 34, Arrijaalu qawwaamoona alan nisaaa'i bimaa fad dalallaahu ba'dahum 'alaa ba'dinw wa bimaaa anfaqoo min amwaalihim ""Men are in charge of women, because Allah hath made the one of them to excel the other, and because they spend of their property (for the support of women)."" Some translations of this verse use ""in charge,"" which seems more possessive but really it means a duty upon man to provide, protect, and look after the women in their lives. To be a guardian or a supporter. This includes, but is not limited to, material sustenance. But this sustenance can be further extended to emotional support, guidance, and companionship required for a healthy marriage. It's not to say women aren't capable, in studying seerah we know Khadija bint Khuwaylid (ra), the Prophet's ﷺ first wife, was a very successful merchant on her own. Ibn Arabi says to assume this character trait, ""If one of the servants meets this condition in responding to the needs of the one who seeks his support, and if it comes frequently, he is self-existing.""Anas bin Malik said: ""Whenever a matter would distress him, the Prophet (ﷺ) would say: 'O Living, O Self-Sustaining Sustainer! In Your Mercy do I seek relief (Ya hayyu ya Qayyum, bi-rahmatika astaghith).'” And with this chain, that he said: ""The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'Be constant with: ""O Possessor of Majesty and Honor (Ya Dhal-Jalali wal-Ikram).'"" [1]The believer benefits from knowing that Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Hayy and Al-Qayyum. We acknowledge that reliance upon anything other than Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is futile. No other is ever-living like Al-Hayy, and none is self-subsisting except Al-Qayyum. And so, as Imam Ghazali puts it, ""man's access to this attribute is in proportion to his detachment from everything that is not God the most high.""Anas said, ""I was with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, when a man made supplication, saying, 'O Originator of the heavens! O Living, Self-Subsistent! I ask of You.' He said, 'Do you know by what he has made supplication? By the One in whose hand my soul is, he has asked Allah by the Name that He answers when He is asked by it.""

الْوَاجِدُ,Al-Wajid,The Perceiver,"The Resourceful; The Unfailing, The Finder.","Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Waajid (in Arabic: ٱلْوَاجِدُ), the one who does not need or lacks anything. He is the most resourceful and finds whatever He wills.","From the root waw-jim-dal (و ج د), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to find, discover, attain what was sought, to become aware of something, to perceive, to experience, to gain or possess wealth, property, resources, to be rich, to have abundance, to be without wants.","Arabic Root:From the root waw-jim-dal (و ج د), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to find, discover, attain what was sought, to become aware of something, to perceive, to experience, to gain or possess wealth, property, resources, to be rich, to have abundance, to be without wants.Among the disputed names:For your notes, this is among the disputed names of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. There is no ayah in the Qur'an where this name is mentioned. However, as an attribute of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ it is accepted and valid.Two meanings of Al-Wajid:This name has two associated meanings, but they are connected. First, wajid (واجد) is an Arabic word meaning ""to find."" So naturally, the emphatic version of Al-Wajid as an attribute of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ means ""The Finder."" This speaks to the idea of Allah's resourcefulness in which there is no deficiency. He is not incapacitated in any way from what He directs His attention to. The idea is that whatever He seeks, He will find. Similar to kun fa-yakunu, ""Be, and it is."" (36:82). He does not lack anything and is absolutely resourceful. This leads to the second meaning of the name, which is the realizer. The one who realizes (i.e., in the sense of gaining something), but also the one who knows the truth in all things.The name Al-Wajid does not appear explicitly in the Qur'an, but many verses describe this quality or attribute of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. وَوَجَدَكَ ضَآلّٗا فَهَدَىٰ وَوَجَدَكَ عَآئِلٗا فَأَغۡنَىٰ97.

We further realize that Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is free from all wants and all needs. Not in a reclusive way, but completely selfless with an open hand to those who seek Him and ask for His help. He is full in every sense of that word; we should not fear turning to Him and asking for all that is good for us. Find sufficiency in Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ for what we seek in all matters is Him. This is unlike the condition that develops from dealing with people who require reciprocity (i.e., favors in return). We're incapable of giving as freely as Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ gives because we're limited, we have finite resources (both in time and money), and in giving we deplete one of these reserves. We can try to make ourselves more resourceful, but it will always be relative. We can never be the absolutely resourceful one.How can we make ourselves more resourceful? It is not always about having more to give more - although that is one aspect of what it means to be resourceful. Resourcefulness can mean trying to accomplish more in less time, being innovative, or finding creative yet simple solutions to overlooked problems. It can also mean spending intelligently from our reserves so as to not be wasteful. If you found a way to buy a TV that was $1000 for $100, you might be very happy for being so resourceful. But the price is only one aspect of the purchase; the TV can cost you a lot in other ways, such as wasted time. This is often a very expensive part of the equation that's missing. If you spend 10 hours a week, that's 40 hours a month or a combined total of 480 hours a year! Imagine if you cut that viewing time in half or a third. You can measure to see if the quality of your life, mood, and happiness increases or decreases. Ask yourself open-ended questions and be curious, ""how could that time be better spent and what impact would that have in my life and for those around me?"" It's a question worth exploring, and each person's answer will be different. Sometimes, being resourceful can simply mean eliminating excess and needing less. Imam Zarruq, in his book the loftiest goal in elucidating Allah's most beautiful names, says, ""Fortifying the heart: That is granted to the one who recites it over every morsel of his food, and Allah knows best."""
الْمَاجِدُ,Al-Majid,The Illustrious,"The Noble, The Sovereign, The Glorious.","Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Maajid (in Arabic: ٱلْمَاجِدُ), the most noble, magnificent, and generous. Majid is very close to the meaning of Jalal (majesty and greatness) and Kareem (full of bounty and honor). He is the one who consistently gives, for His wealth is endless. Truly Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is the most glorious and highly esteemed.","From the root mim-jim-dal (م ج د), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be glorious, dignified, noble and honorable to be lauded, exalted, sublime to be liberal, bountiful, exceedingly generous.","Arabic Root:From the root mim-jim-dal (م ج د), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be glorious, dignified, noble and honorable to be lauded, exalted, sublime to be liberal, bountiful, exceedingly generous.Difference between Al-Majid and Al-Majeed:If you've been reading our guide on the 99 Names of Allah in sequential order, you may get to this name and wonder... this seems oddly familiar. And that's for a good reason. You may recognize the similarity between this name, Al-Majid (ٱلْمَاجِدُ), and the 48th name, Al-Majeed (ٱلْمَجِيدُ). Al-Majeed can be found in the Qur'an. However, Al-Majid as an official name is disputed by some scholars as it is only found in the hadith of Tirmidhi.The names do share similar meanings but vary in their degree of intensity. The fa'eel pattern signals the same meaning with the addition of superlative intensification - grammatically used to describe a quality only Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ possesses. It is more emphatic and indicates perpetualness or permanence. We see this pattern in several of His names, Rahim and Raheem, majid and Majeed, Alim and Aleem, and Hakim and Hakeem.Among the disputed names:The name Al-Majeed is mentioned once in the Qur'an, and the name Al-Majid isn't used. As we've discussed prior, of the 99 names, 81 are explicitly mentioned in the Qur'an. Therefore, there is not one agreed-upon list for the remaining 18 names. Al-Majid is one of those names which has been excluded by some scholars. This includes the likes of Ibn Uthaymeen, Ibn Hazm, and Ibn Hajar, among others. However, others such as Imam al-Ghazali and Ibn Arabi recognize this name in their books on the explanations of Al-Asmaul al-Husna.Below you will find the ayah, which mentions the name Al-Majeed. Note the pairing with the name Al-Hamed (The Praiseworthy). قَالُوٓاْ أَتَعۡجَبِينَ مِنۡ أَمۡرِ ٱللَّهِۖ رَحۡمَتُ ٱللَّهِ وَبَرَكَٰتُهُۥ عَلَيۡكُمۡ أَهۡلَ ٱلۡبَيۡتِۚ إِنَّهُۥ حَمِيدٞ مَّجِيدٞQaalooo ata'jabeena min amril laahi rahmatul laahi wa barakaatuhoo ‘alaikum Ahlal Bayt; innahoo Hameedun MajeedEnglish Translation:""They said, 'Are you amazed at the decree of Allah? May the mercy of Allah and His blessings be upon you, people of the house. Indeed, He is Praiseworthy and Honorable.'"" — (Qur'an 11:73)The only one worthy of praise:The base of the names Al-Majid and Al-Majeed contain the word majd (مجد), which means glorify, honor, or praise. There are many ways to exalt Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. The easiest may be through these three short-phrases, Subhanallah (glory be to Allah - glorification), Alhamdulilah (all praise is due to Allah - praise), and Allahu-Akbar (Allah is the greatest - praise and glorification). Being conscious whenever we have idle time to recite these three short phrases has extensive rewards.As mentioned in the name Al-Majeed, to be considered glorious or magnificent is not a standalone attribute. It comes from the idea of having perfected all other qualities. And Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is the superlative of every adjective imaginable. He is not just the merciful, but the most merciful; He is not just wise, but the all-wise. Whatever quality you can think of, knowledge, wealth, power, sight, living, creating - Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is the greatest. He's perfected perfection. There is no other whose essence is perfection and this is where His majesty, nobility, and superiority over everything comes from. سَبِّحِ ٱسۡمَ رَبِّكَ ٱلۡأَعۡلَىSabbihisma Rabbikal A'laaEnglish Translation:""Exalt the name of your Lord, the Most High,"" — (Qur'an 87:1)It was narrated that Anas bin Malik said: ""Umm Sulaim came to the Prophet ﷺ and said: 'O Messenger of Allah ﷺ, teach me some words that I may supplicate with during my prayer.' He said: 'Glorify Allah (by saying SubhanAllah) ten times, and praise Him (by saying Alhamdulilah) ten times, and magnify Him (by saying Allahu Akbar) ten times, then ask Him for what you need; He will say: 'Yes, yes.' [1]It was narrated from 'Abdur-Rahman bin Ghanm that Abu Malik Al-Ash'ari told him that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: ""Isbagh Al-Wudu is half of faith; Alhamdulillah (praise be to Allah) fills the balance; the Tasbih and the Takbir fill the heavens and Earth; the Salah is light; the Zakah is a sign (of sincerity); patience is an illuminating torch; and the Qur'an is proof, either for you or against you.""

الْواحِدُ,Al-Wahid,The One,"The Unique, The Single, The Only One.","Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Waahid (in Arabic: ٱلْوَٰحِدُ), the One and only God. There is no alternative. He is the sole originator from which all has arisen. He has no partners or relationships. None is equal to Him.","From the root waw-ha-dal (و ح د), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be one, to be made one, to be called one, to be unique, singular, to be one apart from others.","Arabic Root:From the root waw-ha-dal (و ح د), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be one, to be made one, to be called one, to be unique, singular, to be one apart from others.The oneness of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ:Al-Wahid and Al-Ahad are two names which describe tawhid (the oneness) of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. This is what characterizes our deen and differentiates Islam from other religions. That's why the first step to converting to Islam is to recite the shahada. We testify, la ilaha illa allah, ""there is no god but Allah"", muhammadur rasul-ullah, ""and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah."" This core belief is shared among all Muslims and is the first pillar of Islam. These two names of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ further emphasize this idea of Allah's oneness.The word Waahid in Arabic means 'one.' For example, someone who is Waheed uz-zaman is said to be a unique person of that era (time). So it's used in a relative sense, but as a name of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ it is absolute. He is unique in all aspects, the only one who embodies perfection. He has no equal. Throughout our guide on the 99 Names of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ we discuss and encourage ways in which we can share in the divine attributes, to be merciful, giving, caring, and a friend to others. But these are human characterizations. It's important to realize that no one comes close to sharing in His attributes or actions. He is alone and unique in His essence. As Imam Zarruq has said, ""He is One in His Attributes: He resembles nothing and nothing resembles Him.""Imam al-Ghazali also mentions how Al-Wahid refers to the one who can neither be divided nor duplicated. This quality of being indivisible also makes Him one since He's not separated into parts. For being separated into parts makes the previous part dependent on the other to be considered whole. And Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Ghaniyy, The Self-Sufficient - free from dependence on anyone or anything. قُلۡ مَن رَّبُّ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلۡأَرۡضِ قُلِ ٱللَّهُۚ قُلۡ أَفَٱتَّخَذۡتُم مِّن دُونِهِۦٓ أَوۡلِيَآءَ لَا يَمۡلِكُونَ لِأَنفُسِهِمۡ نَفۡعٗا وَلَا ضَرّٗاۚ قُلۡ هَلۡ يَسۡتَوِي ٱلۡأَعۡمَىٰ وَٱلۡبَصِيرُ أَمۡ هَلۡ تَسۡتَوِي ٱلظُّلُمَٰتُ وَٱلنُّورُۗ أَمۡ جَعَلُواْ لِلَّهِ شُرَكَآءَ خَلَقُواْ كَخَلۡقِهِۦ فَتَشَٰبَهَ ٱلۡخَلۡقُ عَلَيۡهِمۡۚ قُلِ ٱللَّهُ خَٰلِقُ كُلِّ شَيۡءٖ وَهُوَ ٱلۡوَٰحِدُ ٱلۡقَهَّـٰرُQul mar Rabbus samaawaati wal ard; qulillaah; qul afattakhaztum min dooniheee awliyaaa'a laa yamlikoona li anfusihim naf'anw wa laa darraa; qul hal yastawil a'maa wal baseeru am hal tastawiz zulumaatu wannoor; am ja'aloo lillaahi shurakaaa'a khalaqoo kakhalqihee fatashaa bahal khalqu 'alaihim; qulil laahu Khaaliqu kulli shai'inw wa Huwal Waahidul QahharEnglish Translation:""Say, 'Who is Lord of the heavens and earth?'

Al-Qahhar is the ""Prevailing One,"" the one who dominates absolutely. The pairing is meant to instill humility in mankind. Humans tend to arrange themselves in a hierarchy. We see this with countries, governments, companies, tribes, sports teams, etc. As an individual climbs the ladder, they begin to take more control and serve as a leader to the surrounding people. But they can become corrupted by this power and use it for personal gain rather than the greater good. The higher they climb, the less they may think they have no superior to answer to. But Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ reminds us He is the one who dominates all others and does so alone. No matter how great you may think you are, we will all be held for our transgressions. قُلۡ أَيُّ شَيۡءٍ أَكۡبَرُ شَهَٰدَةٗۖ قُلِ ٱللَّهُۖ شَهِيدُۢ بَيۡنِي وَبَيۡنَكُمۡۚ وَأُوحِيَ إِلَيَّ هَٰذَا ٱلۡقُرۡءَانُ لِأُنذِرَكُم بِهِۦ وَمَنۢ بَلَغَۚ أَئِنَّكُمۡ لَتَشۡهَدُونَ أَنَّ مَعَ ٱللَّهِ ءَالِهَةً أُخۡرَىٰۚ قُل لَّآ أَشۡهَدُۚ قُلۡ إِنَّمَا هُوَ إِلَٰهٞ وَٰحِدٞ وَإِنَّنِي بَرِيٓءٞ مِّمَّا تُشۡرِكُونَQul ayyu shai'in akbaru shahaadatan qulil laahu shaheedum bainee wa bainakum; wa oohiya ilaiya haazal Qur'aanu li unzirakum bihee wa mam balagh; a'innakum latashhadoona anna ma'al laahi aalihatan ukhraa; qul laaa ashhad; qul innamaa Huwa Ilaahunw Waahidunw wa innanee baree'um mimmaa tushrikoonEnglish Translation:""Say, “What thing is greatest in testimony?” Say, “Allah is witness between me and you.

اَلاَحَدُ,Al-Ahad,The Unique,"The Sole One, The Incomparable.","Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Ahad (in Arabic: ٱلْأَحَد), He is incomparable, unequaled, and indivisible. Al-Ahad is the One who was, is, and will ever remain alone. No one can ever be equal to Him in the essence of all His beautiful attributes.","From the root hamza-ha-dal (أ ح د), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be one, to be the only one, one alone, sole, to unite, unify.","Arabic Root:From the root hamza-ha-dal (أ ح د), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be one, to be the only one, one alone, sole, to unite, unify.Differences between Al-Ahad and Al-WahidAs we mentioned previously, Al-Wahid and Al-Ahad are two names that describe the tawhid (the oneness) of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. He is the one who can neither be divided nor duplicated, making Him the one and only. This is the starting point of what it means to be a Muslim, the core belief from which everything else stems. That is why in the shahadah, we testify, la ilaha illa allahem>, ""there is no god but Allah."" He is said to be the one who existed before anything else existed. In this sense, He was the first. For a further explanation of His oneness, please view the section of Al-Wahid.In this section, we explore the view of scholars explaining the difference between Al-Ahad and Al-Wahid, although both refer to His oneness. Each name of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is unique and offers a new shade of meaning. They are not synonymous, although there may be some overlap. Al-Ahad describes absolute oneness and uniqueness; none compares to Him. In contrast, Al-Wahid refers to His being as the numerical one. Some commentators noted that Al-Wahid indicates affirmation, whereas Al-Ahad refers to negation. For example, fi alhiqihi, lam ara ahada, ""Actually, I didn't see anyone,"" and yabqa rajulun wahidun, ""one man remains."" Others note that Ahad is seen as conveying a higher degree. He is intensely one, uniquely one.The name Al-Wahid is mentioned many times throughout the Qur'an. The name Al-Ahad appears in one place, and that is in Surah Ikhlas. قُلۡ هُوَ ٱللَّهُ أَحَدٌQul huwal laahu ahadEnglish Translation:""Say, “He is Allah, [who is] One,"" — (Qur'an 112:1) وَلَمۡ يَكُن لَّهُۥ كُفُوًا أَحَدُۢWa lam yakul-lahoo kufuwan ahad (section 1)English Translation:""Nor is there to Him any equivalent."" — (Qur'an 112:4)Sa'īd b. al-Musayyib reported in mursal form that the Prophet said, ""If anyone recites ten times 'Say, He is God, One', a palace will be built for him in paradise because of it; if anyone recites twenty times two palaces will be built for him in paradise because of it; and if anyone recites it thirty times three palaces will be built for him in paradise because of it."" 'Umar b. al-Khattāb said, ""I swear by God, messenger of God, that we shall then produce many palaces for ourselves;"" to which he replied, ""God's abundant grace is even more comprehensive than that.""  [1]The Love For Surah Ikhlas:Anas said: One of the Ansar used to lead the Ansar in Salat in the Quba' mosque and it was his habit to recite Qul Huwal-lahu Ahad whenever he wanted to recite something in Salat. When he finished that Surah, he would recite another one with it. He followed the same procedure in each Rak'a. His companions discussed this with him and said, ""You recite this Surah and do not consider it sufficient and then you recite another. So would you recite it alone or leave it and recite some other.""  He said, ""I will never leave it and if you want me to be your Imam on this condition then it is all right; otherwise I will leave you.""  They knew that he was the best amongst them and they did not like someone else to lead them in Salat. When the Prophet ﷺ went to them as usual, they informed him about it. The Prophet ﷺ addressed him and said, ""O so-and-so, what forbids you from doing what your companions ask you to do? Why do you read this Surah particularly in every Rak'a?"" He repiled, ""I love this Surah."" The Prophet ﷺ said, ""Your love for this Surah will make you enter Paradise.""  [2]Abu Darda reported Allah's Apostle ﷺ as saying: Is any one of you incapable of reciting a third of the Qur'an in a night? They (the Companions) asked: How could one recite a third of the Qur'an (in a night)? Upon this he (the Holy Prophet ﷺ) said:"" 'Say: He is Allah, One' (Qur'an 112) is equivalent to a third of the Qur'an.""  [3]Reflection:The believer benefits in knowing that Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Ahad. We realize what it means to be truly unique. Allah is the one and only Creator (Al-Khaliq), the one and only Provider (Ar-Razzaq). As the title of the Surah Ikhlas (meaning 'sincerity') suggests, we turn to Him with the purest intentions to seek His mercy, love, and acceptance. We also learn of the extensive rewards that's gift-wrapped for the believer in reciting Surah Ikhlas.We can reflect on this name by asking ourselves how we are unique. What admirable qualities do I possess or wish to develop? What are attributes honorable in the sight of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ often neglected? It's easy to conform and blend in with the masses. In fact, we may unconsciously do this so as to not be ostracized from standing out. Instead, we should recognize how Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ made us unique and be grateful to Him. Don't fall for the dreams people sell that you should be like them, which can only be achieved by purchasing their product. This is a chase that will lead to unfulfillment. True contentedness is through acceptance and gratitude for what Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ has given you.Supplication from hadith:اللّهُـمَّ إِنِّـي أَسْأَلُـكَ يا اللهُ بِأَنَّـكَ الواحِـدُ الأَحَـد الصَّـمَدُ الَّـذي لَـمْ يَلِـدْ وَلَمْ يولَدْ وَلَمْ يَكـنْ لَهُ كُـفُواً أَحَـد أَنْ تَغْـفِرْ لي ذُنـوبي إِنَّـكَ أَنْـتَ الغَفـورُ الرَّحِّـيمAllahumma inni as'aluka ya Allah bi'annaka 'l-Wahidu 'l-Ahadus-samad, alladhi lam yalid wa lam yulad, wa lam yakun lahu kufuwan ahad, an taghfir li dhunubi, innaka anta 'l-Ghafurur-Rahim.English Translation:""O Allah, I ask You.

الصَّمَدُ,As-Samad,The Eternal,"The Everlasting, The Master, The Self-Sufficient.","Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is As-Samad (in Arabic: ٱلْصَّمَدُ), meaning He is the one whom refuge is sought in times of adversity. He is eternal, whole and complete. There is no emptiness.","From the root sad mim dāl (ص م د), which occurs only once in the Qur'an.

We've covered some of these aspects in the previous names, so less time will be spent here elaborating on those qualities. The first is the idea of self-sustaining, self-sufficiency, and being independent of all things (see also #63, Al-Qayyum). The name is mentioned in Surah Ikhlas shortly after being told that Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Ahad (The Unique / The Sole One). These names come together to paint a picture that He is alone, indivisible, and unique. There is no deity outside of Him who we can sufficiently rely upon. The nature of creation is neediness, so we turn to the one absolutely free of needs and depend on no one else. He alone is enough for the believer. All our troubles, needs, and wants are handled perfectly in the care of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ.Also note, this name or attribute of being Samad is only applicable for Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. قُلْ هُوَ ٱللَّهُ أَحَدٌ ٱللَّهُ ٱلصَّمَدُ1. Qul huwal laahu ahad2. Allah hus-samadEnglish Translation: ""Say, ""He is Allah, [who is] One, Allah, the Eternal Refuge."" — ( Qur'an 112:1-2)The other common interpretation of As-Samad is the master who has complete control.  ""Ibn Abbas, 'He is the Master Who is perfect in His sovereignty, the Most Noble Who is perfect in His nobility, the Most Magnificent Who is perfect in His magnificence, the Most Forbearing Who is perfect in His forbearance, the All-Knowing Who is perfect in His knowledge, and the Most Wise Who is perfect in His wisdom. He is the One Who is perfect in all aspects of nobility and authority. He is Allah, glory be unto Him. These attributes are not befitting anyone other than Him. He has no coequal and nothing is like Him. Glory be to Allah, the One, the Irresistible.'""  [1]From The Study Qur'an , it mentions As-Samad ""lexical, non-theological meaning indicates something solid and impenetrable or simply 'not hollow.'"" It then describes theologically As-Samad as being interpreted by some as ""an allusion to the primary or initial cause of all things, an eternally self-sufficient, independent being who continues to exist after His creation has ceased to exist the one who has and always will be."" Supplication from hadith with the name As-Samad:Abdullah bin Buraidah Al Aslami narrated from his father, who said: ""The Prophet ﷺ heard a man supplicating, and he was saying: اللَّهُمَّ   إِنِّي   أَسْأَلُكَ   بِأَنِّي   أَشْهَدُ   أَنَّكَ   أَنْتَ   اللَّهُ   لاَ   إِلَهَ   إِلاَّ   أَنْتَ   الأَحَدُ   الصَّمَدُ   الَّذِي   لَمْ   يَلِدْ   وَلَمْ   يُولَدْ   وَلَمْ   يَكُنْ   لَهُ   كُفُوًا   أَحَدٌAllahumma inni as'aluka bi annī ashhadu annaka antallāh, la ilaha illa ant, al-ahadus-samad, alladhi lam yalid wa lam yūlad, wa lam yakun lahu kufuwan ahadEnglish Translation:""O Allah, indeed, I ask you by my testifying that You are Allah, there is none worthy of worship except You, the One, As-Samad, the one who does not beget, nor was begotten, and there is none who is like Him.""[2]He said: ""So he said: 'By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, he has asked Allah by His Greatest Name, the one which if He is called upon by it, He responds, and when He is asked by it, He gives.'""Reflection:The believer benefits from knowing that Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is As-Samad. No one but Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ could fulfill all our needs, so we turn to Him and ask for His mercy. Ibn Abbas was privileged to be so young and to have accepted Islam so early. He had immediate access to the Prophet ﷺ who would often give him advice. So one day, he was praying behind the Prophet ﷺ, the Prophet ﷺ turned to him told him the following. "" He said: 'O boy! I will teach you a statement: Be mindful of Allah and He will protect you. Be mindful of Allah and you will find Him before you. When you ask, ask Allah, and when you seek aid, seek Allah's aid. Know that if the entire creation were to gather together to do something to benefit you - you would never get any benefit except that Allah had written for you. And if they were to gather to do something to harm you - you would never be harmed except that Allah had written for you. The pens are lifted and the pages are dried.'""  [3]For all our needs, be it spiritual, physical, or material - the source is Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ who As-Samad, the eternal refuge. We should never feel as though we are asking for too much and limit our asking, this would be an insult to Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ who is Ar-Razzaq (The Provider). Any restriction you put in your du'a is a reflection of a self-imposed limitation of what you believe is possible for yourself. Thabit narrated from Anas, who said, ""The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'Let one of you ask his Lord for his every need, even until he asks Him for the strap of his sandal when it breaks.'""  [4]Imam Zarruq writes of As-Samad as ""the one whom people direct themselves to in respect of needs to be provided for."" So the anthropomorphic realization of this divine attribute would be to become a person who people can turn to for help. Other people need us just as we need them. Seek the pleasure of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ by helping your fellow brother or sister. Be a source of comfort and assistance that benefits them. And remember, la hawla wala quwwata, ""there is no might nor power except with Allah."" All physical manifestation of help in this world comes from Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ.References:[1] Tafsir by Ibn Kathir | commentary of surah ikhlas ayah 2[2] Sahih (Darussalam) Jami at-Tirmidhi 3475[3] Hasan (Darussalam) Jami at-Tirmidhi 2516[4] Hasan (Darussalam) Jami at-Tirmidhi 3604i"
الْقَادِرُ,Al-Qadir / Al-Qadeer,The All-Powerful,"The Able, The All Capable","Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Qaadir (in Arabic: الْقَادِرُ), the most powerful with the ability to measure out everything. Whenever He decrees a thing, it is. Nothing can interrupt or disturb the will of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. He is the most capable without any limitations.","From the root qaf-dal-ra (ق د ر), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to measure something, to make manifest the measure of something, to distribute or apportion (as though by measure), measure-out to decree, to ordain, to decide a matter (as though measuring it to fit), to exercise thought in preparing something, to make use of reason (measuring out), to have the power, to accomplish, to be rendered able, capable, to be able, to prevail, to be empowered, to have control over.","Arabic Root:From the root qaf-dal-ra (ق د ر), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to measure something, to make manifest the measure of something, to distribute or apportion (as though by measure), measure-out to decree, to ordain, to decide a matter (as though measuring it to fit), to exercise thought in preparing something, to make use of reason (measuring out), to have the power, to accomplish, to be rendered able, capable, to be able, to prevail, to be empowered, to have control over.A name for inspiration:This name of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is a beautiful name to inspire optimism and fill us with vibrant energy. The belief in this attribute also connects us to all the other names. Al-Qadir is the able one - this refers to His strength and ability to do as He pleases. Sometimes we may want a thing, but as time goes on, we lose faith, it seems too distant or impossible, and we ask of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ less and less. This is wrong. We should continue to ask from Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ for as long as we're alive because only He can give it to us. Why would we stop? Prophet Ibrahim (as) was reportedly eighty-six years old when he was granted his first child. If a thing doesn't benefit you, then Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ may withhold it, and He knows best. But don't ever believe it's not within your fate because you don't know. Believing so becomes self-fulfilling as you'll ask less and not take the necessary action to receive His barakah (blessing). It's as if to say Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ can't or won't do this for me.The best attitude for a believer is to say neither I can nor can't. The servant of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ operates in a state of surrender to Allah; he works to serve. He does let his ego direct his action through the delusion of superiority and self-control. But the other extreme is the delusion of irresponsibility, that you're incapable of doing anything. Simply be a servant who serves his creator, his family, and his community and lives immensely thankful to His creator. The verses in the Qur'an which mention the name Al-Qadir encourage us to keep asking Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ in this light. قُلِ ٱللَّهُمَّ مَـٰلِكَ ٱلْمُلْكِ تُؤْتِى ٱلْمُلْكَ مَن تَشَآءُ وَتَنزِعُ ٱلْمُلْكَ مِمَّن تَشَآءُ وَتُعِزُّ مَن تَشَآءُ وَتُذِلُّ مَن تَشَآءُ ۖ بِيَدِكَ ٱلْخَيْرُ ۖ إِنَّكَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍۢ قَدِيرٌۭQulil laahumma Maalikal Mulki tu'til mulka man tashaaa'u wa tanzi'ul mulka mimman tashhaaa'u wa tu'izzu man tashaaa'u wa tuzillu man tashaaa'u biyadikal khairu innaka 'alaa kulli shai'in QadeerEnglish Translation: ""Say, 'O Allah, Owner of Sovereignty, You give sovereignty to whom You will and You take sovereignty away from whom You will. You honor whom You will and You humble whom You will. In Your hand is [all] good. Indeed, You are over all things competent.'"" — ( Qur'an 3:26)The story of an unnamed Prophet:The Qur'an also provides a lesson from an unnamed Prophet (may peace be upon him). He stood looking at a fallen/abandoned town, and He asked out of curiosity (not from a place of doubt), ""How will Allah restore life to this town that is now dead?"" Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ then revealed to him His ability and what He's capable of. The Prophet, at the end of this, calls upon the name Al-Qadir saying, ""I know that Allah is over all things competent."" Competent here referring knowledge, skill, or ability to do something successfully. أَوۡ  كَٱلَّذِي  مَرَّ  عَلَىٰ  قَرۡيَةٖ  وَهِيَ  خَاوِيَةٌ  عَلَىٰ  عُرُوشِهَا  قَالَ  أَنَّىٰ  يُحۡيِۦ  هَٰذِهِ  ٱللَّهُ  بَعۡدَ  مَوۡتِهَاۖ  فَأَمَاتَهُ  ٱللَّهُ  مِاْئَةَ  عَامٖ  ثُمَّ  بَعَثَهُۥۖ  قَالَ  كَمۡ  لَبِثۡتَۖ  قَالَ  لَبِثۡتُ  يَوۡمًا  أَوۡ  بَعۡضَ  يَوۡمٖۖ  قَالَ  بَل  لَّبِثۡتَ  مِاْئَةَ  عَامٖ  فَٱنظُرۡ  إِلَىٰ  طَعَامِكَ  وَشَرَابِكَ  لَمۡ  يَتَسَنَّهۡۖ  وَٱنظُرۡ  إِلَىٰ  حِمَارِكَ  وَلِنَجۡعَلَكَ  ءَايَةٗ  لِّلنَّاسِۖ  وَٱنظُرۡ  إِلَى  ٱلۡعِظَامِ  كَيۡفَ  نُنشِزُهَا  ثُمَّ  نَكۡسُوهَا  لَحۡمٗاۚ  فَلَمَّا  تَبَيَّنَ  لَهُۥ  قَالَ  أَعۡلَمُ  أَنَّ  ٱللَّهَ  عَلَىٰ  كُلِّ  شَيۡءٖ  قَدِيرٞAw kallazee marra 'alaa qaryatinw wa hiya khaawiyatun 'alaa 'urooshihaa qaala annaa yuhyee haazihil laahu ba'da mawtihaa fa amaatahul laahu mi'ata 'aamin summa ba'asahoo qaala kam labista qaala labistu yawman aw ba'da yawmin qaala bal labista mi'ata 'aamin fanzur ilaa ta'aamika wa sharaabika lam yatasannah wanzur ilaa himaarika wa linaj'alaka Aayatal linnaasi wanzur ilal'izaami kaifa nunshizuhaa summa naksoohaa lahmaa; falammaa tabayyana lahoo qaala a'lamu annal laaha 'alaa kulli shai'in QadeerEnglish Translation:""Or [consider such an example] as the one who passed by a township which had fallen into ruin. He said, 'How will Allah bring this to life after its death?' So Allah caused him to die for a hundred years; then He revived him. He said, 'How long have you remained?' The man said, 'I have remained a day or part of a day.' He said, 'Rather, you have remained one hundred years. Look at your food and your drink; it has not changed with time. And look at your donkey; and We will make you a sign for the people. And look at the bones [of this donkey] - how We raise them and then We cover them with flesh.' And when it became clear to him, he said, 'I know that Allah is over all things competent.'"" — (Qur'an 2:259)From the life of Prophet Zakariya (as):The story of Prophet Zakariya (as) and Maryam (May Allah be pleased with her) it perfectly illustrates the quality of how Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Qadir (though the name is not directly used). Zakariya (as) was Maryam (ra) sponsor and was married to her sister. He used to visit Maryam (ra) in her chambers quite often, and whenever He did, he was surprised by the provisions that seemed to multiply with each visit. Eventually, he just asked,"" 'O Mary, from where is this [coming] to you?' She said, 'It is from Allah. Indeed, Allah provides for whom He wills without account.'"" ( Qur'an 3:37). Right then Prophet Zakariya (as) made a du'a asking from Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ for a child. For whatever reason, this had not occurred to Zakariya (as). Like Prophet Ibrahim (as) he was in his old age, but his wife was also infertile. The truth was revealed at that moment, and Zakariya (as) made the following du'a: هُنَالِكَ دَعَا زَكَرِيَّا رَبَّهُۥۖ قَالَ رَبِّ هَبۡ لِي مِن لَّدُنكَ ذُرِّيَّةٗ طَيِّبَةًۖ إِنَّكَ سَمِيعُ ٱلدُّعَآءِHunaaalika da'aa Zakariyyaa Rabbahoo qaala Rabbi hab lee mil ladunka zurriyyatan taiyibatan innaka samee'ud du'aaaEnglish Translation:""At that, Zechariah called upon his Lord, saying, 'My Lord, grant me from Yourself a good offspring. Indeed, You are the Hearer of supplication.'"" — (Qur'an 3:38)Reflection:Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ gives without measure and is able to overcome every obstacle. The believer benefits from knowing Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Qadir. Just as when you need help moving, you call on friends or family that are able to help. You don't call on people who are not reliable, unavailable, or overseas. Similarly, Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Qadir - the all-powerful, the all-able, the one who can assist you no matter the circumstance. Sometimes we say Insha-Allah, but we don't believe it. We don't have enough conviction. Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ knows no limitations, but perhaps He may limit us based on the ones we self-impose. By setting the bar too low, He may fulfill our du'a, so we miss out on all the other gifts He could've given us. أَوَلَمَّآ أَصَـٰبَتْكُم مُّصِيبَةٌۭ قَدْ أَصَبْتُم مِّثْلَيْهَا قُلْتُمْ أَنَّىٰ هَـٰذَا ۖ قُلْ هُوَ مِنْ عِندِ أَنفُسِكُمْ ۗ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍۢ قَدِيرٌۭAwa lammaaa asaabatkum museebatun qad asabtum mislaihaa qultum annaa haazaa qul huwa min 'indi anfusikum; innal laaha 'alaa kulli shai'in QadeerEnglish Translation:""Why [is it that] when a [single] disaster struck you [on the day of Uhud], although you had struck [the enemy in the battle of Badr] with one twice as great, you said, ""From where is this?"" Say, ""It is from yourselves."" Indeed, Allah is over all things competent."" — (Qur'an 3:165)After the battle of Uhud, which was a great loss, the believers weaker in faith had begun questioning how they could lose when Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ and His Messenger ﷺ were on their side. They asked, ""From where is this?"" and Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ responded, ""It is from yourselves."" This reminds us that we must move towards certain things we've asked for. We have to take some responsibility in our du'a. Otherwise, we may fall victim to the same tragedy that occurred on the battlefield. The loss of Uhud was due to impatience. They were not disciplined, lured by material wealth, and abandoned their stations. And so, just as Al-Qadir has the power to make them victorious, He also has the power to bring about their defeat. He can do anything He wishes. The implied lesson is if you make du'a for knowledge, Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ may give you the cognitive mental ability. He may make the teachers and books accessible, but if your pride or laziness prevents you from learning from them, ""It is from yourselves."""
الْمُقْتَدِرُ,Al-Muqtadir,The All-Determiner,"The Powerful, The Dominant, The Enforcer.","Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Muqtadir (in Arabic: ٱلْمُقْتَدِرُ), the all-powerful who delivers a suitable measure of all things. He has absolute strength, power, and mastery. Nothing is beyond his power.","From the root qaf-dal-ra (ق د ر), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to measure something, know the measure of something, to distribute, allot or apportion the suitable measure to decree, to ordain, to decide a matter (as though measuring it to fit), to exercise thought in preparing something, to make use of reason, to intend or determine something, to have the power, to accomplish, to be rendered able, to be able to prevail, to be empowered.","Arabic Root:From the root qaf-dal-ra (ق د ر), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to measure something, know the measure of something, to distribute, allot or apportion the suitable measure to decree, to ordain, to decide a matter (as though measuring it to fit), to exercise thought in preparing something, to make use of reason, to intend or determine something, to have the power, to accomplish, to be rendered able, to be able to prevail, to be empowered.Difference between Al-Qadir and Al-Muqtadir:The names Al-Qadir (The All-Powerful) and Al-Muqtadir (The All-Determiner) both refer to Allah's attribute of possessing power or being capable. But as Imam al-Ghazali mentions, ""All-Determiner is more emphatic. Power is equivalent to the intention by which a thing comes into existence according to a determinate plan of will and knowledge, and in conformity with both of them.""So, both names establish Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ as having power, but Al-Muqtadir exercises His power over everything. The example al-Ghazali gives how Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ has determined a day for resurrection. In this sense, He's the All-Determiner, The Enforcer. But if He wished, he could bring about the day of judgment today - but He chooses not to. Everything is done according to His knowledge; the reason for not doing so is up to Him. He's fixed an appointed time, and nothing can resist His plan (similar to Al-Qahhar - the irresistible).Pairing with the name Al-MalikCoupling of the name Al-Muqtadir with the name Al-Malik (The King): فِي مَقۡعَدِ صِدۡقٍ عِندَ مَلِيكٖ مُّقۡتَدِرِۭFee maq'adi sidqin 'inda Maleekin MuqtadirEnglish Translation: ""In a seat of honor near a Sovereign, Perfect in Ability."" — (Qur'an 54:55)What has been said about the pairing of the names Al-Muqtadir and Al-Malik. Imam Zarruq wrote, ""Al-Muqtadir comes from iqtidar, which is to overpower whoever He granted a portion of power to. As such, it reverts to the gathering meaning encompassed by the name Al-Malik."" It is Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ who has complete and total power. He puts into creation whatever power they possess. No creation by itself is powerful except that Allah has made it such. ""If Allah is your helper none can overcome you, and if He withdraw His help from you, who is there who can help you after Him? In Allah let believers put their trust."" ( Qur'an 3:160) وَٱضۡرِبۡ لَهُم مَّثَلَ ٱلۡحَيَوٰةِ ٱلدُّنۡيَا كَمَآءٍ أَنزَلۡنَٰهُ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ فَٱخۡتَلَطَ بِهِۦ نَبَاتُ ٱلۡأَرۡضِ فَأَصۡبَحَ هَشِيمٗا تَذۡرُوهُ ٱلرِّيَٰحُۗ وَكَانَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيۡءٖ مُّقۡتَدِرًاWadrib lahum masalal hayaatid dunyaa kamaaa'in anzalnaahu minas samaaa'i fakhtalata bihee nabaatul ardi fa asbaha hasheeman tazroo hur riyaah; wa kaanal laahu 'alaa kulli shai'im muqtadiraaEnglish Translation: ""And present to them the example of the life of this world, [its being] like rain which We send down from the sky, and the vegetation of the earth mingles with it and [then] it becomes dry remnants, scattered by the winds. And Allah is ever, over all things, Perfect in Ability."" — ( Qur'an 18:45) كَذَّبُواْ بِـَٔايَٰتِنَا كُلِّهَا فَأَخَذۡنَٰهُمۡ أَخۡذَ عَزِيزٖ مُّقۡتَدِرٍKazzaboo bi Aayaatinaa kullihaa fa akhaznaahum akhza azeezim muqtadirEnglish Translation: ""They denied Our signs, all of them, so We seized them with a seizure of one Exalted in Might and Perfect in Ability."" — (Qur'an 54:42)Reflection:The weight of the world is on the shoulders of the one who believes everything is his doing. Any failure or success is believed by him to be attributed to him. This is a very unhealthy attitude and can be the root cause of many personal troubles, from extreme egotism to self-hatred and anxiety. There is still personal accountability and responsibility, no doubt. We quote the famous hadith which was mentioned previously; Anas bin Malik narrated that a man said: ""O Messenger of Allah! Shall I tie it and rely (upon Allah), or leave it loose and rely (upon Allah)?"" He said: ""Tie it and rely (upon Allah)."" [1]Do what is required and leave the rest up to Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. If what you wished to achieve comes true, alhamdulillah, Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ has given you the power and allowed it to be. But if things don't go the way you imagined, say alhamdulillah for Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ knows best. ""For We do determine (according to need); for We are the best to determine (things)"" (Qur'an 77:23). Submit to Allah's will, become in love with it, and embrace it. This is the route for the one who wants to receive His love, blessings, and power.It's important not to indulge in unnecessary self-criticism. There is a healthy form of guilt and an unhealthy form. A normal person may feel shame or embarrassed in failing an exam, but to what degree depends entirely on the circumstance. With the analogy of the camel, the question would be, do you sincerely believe you had done your part in preparation? Did you study, seek the help of teachers, assistants, tutors, or online videos? Did you do all that you could've done? If not, let this failure serve as feedback that leads to behavior change. Don't repeat the mistake of the past. If you are stressed, there's often an underlying cause; take the first step to address it because negligence would be from yourself.In the story of Prophet Musa (as), when he tried to break up the fight, he had no intention of killing the man. As soon as he realizes that the man has died, he says, ""This is from the work of Satan. Indeed, he is a manifest, misleading enemy."" He felt remorseful immediately and began praying to Allah, Rabbi innee zalamtu nafsee faghfir lee meaning, ""My Lord, indeed I have wronged myself, so forgive me."" In the same ayah, we are told Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ responded to this call, ""and He forgave him. Indeed, He is the Forgiving, the Merciful."" ( Qur'an 28:18). From what we know of the story is Musa (as) did not dwell on this failure or mistake. He made sincere repentance, and the story continues. He forgave himself just as Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ had forgiven him. The only way to get rid of the skeletons in your closet is to pile so much good on top of it that it becomes hidden from view. Musa (as) shifted his focus from his dire state to seeking good that could be done in the name of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ, Rabbi innee limaaa anzalta ilaiya min khairin faqeer, ""My Lord, indeed I am, for whatever good You would send down to me, in need."" ( Qur'an 28:24)Now, if you can confidently say there is nothing more you could've done, then Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ knows best, and we can only connect the dots looking back. But what sense does it make to feel terrible about something you cannot control?References:[1]Hasan (Darussalam) Jami` at-Tirmidhi 2517"
الْمُقَدِّمُ,Al-Muqaddim,The Expediter,"The Promoter, The Expediter, The One who Brings Forward.","Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Muqaddim (in Arabic: ٱلْمُقَدِّمُ), The One who promotes or brings forward. This includes promoting His servants to higher ranks.","From the root qaf-dal-mim (ق د م), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to precede, to come before, to head, to lead, to offer, to bring forward, to make foremost, to put at the front, to advance, to promote, to exist without beginning.","Arabic Root:From the root qaf-dal-mim (ق د م), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to precede, to come before, to head, to lead, to offer, to bring forward, to make foremost, to put at the front, to advance, to promote, to exist without beginning.The next two names in this series are closely connected and should be mentioned together for full comprehension. Al-Muqqadim is The Promoter, or the one who brings forth, and the other is Al-Mu'akhkhir, The Postponer, or the one who pushes away.In this section, we will focus on what it means to refer to Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ by the name called Al-Muqaddim, and in the next, we'll cover in more detail the name Al-Mu'akhkhir. But note they should not be separated and mentioned in pairs like Al-Qabid and Al-Basit.First Interpretation - The Promoter:The first meaning is the promoter. This interpretation is likened to the name Ar-Rafi (The Exalter, The Elevator). Imam al-Ghazali mentions that the one who is brought close to Him is promoted. They have been given guidance and shown mercy. This includes the angels, prophets, friends, and scholars. And so Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ 'brings forth' some through worship and seeking His approval and guidance.Second Interpretation - A discussion on free will:The second interpretation is that Al-Muqaddim is the one who expedites. This discussion leads us down the path of free will and fate, which understandably can be confusing, and we'll try our best to clarify.As the name pertains, He can make something happen sooner and be accomplished more quickly. For example, we know Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ has proportioned our rizq for us as ""(inscribed) in Al-Lauh Al-Mahfuz (The Preserved Tablet)"" (Qur'an 85:22). But from our perspective, through du'a and other actions which are beloved to Him, we can have our rizq expedited and increased. But from Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ perspective, there has been no change in the prescribed tablet. Our total rizq was decreed just as the du'a we made was known to Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ before we made it. But from our vantage point, it seems as though it was expedited. Remember Allah's سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ existence is not linear. He is not bounded by time like we are.Narrated by Abdullah bin Mus'ud: Allah's Messenger ﷺ, the true and truly inspired said, ""(The matter of the creation of) a human being is put together in the womb of the mother in forty days, and then he becomes a clot of thick blood for a similar period, and then a piece of flesh for a similar period. Then Allah sends an angel who is ordered to write four things. He is ordered to write down his (i.e. the new creature's) deeds, his livelihood, his (date of) death, and whether he will be blessed or wretched (in religion). Then the soul is breathed into him. So, a man amongst you may do (good deeds till there is only a cubit between him and Paradise and then what has been written for him decides his behavior and he starts doing (evil) deeds characteristic of the people of the (Hell) Fire. And similarly a man amongst you may do (evil) deeds till there is only a cubit between him and the (Hell) Fire, and then what has been written for him decides his behavior, and he starts doing deeds characteristic of the people of Paradise.""[1]Abdullah b. Amr b. al-'As reported: I heard Allah's Messenger ﷺ as saying: Allah ordained the measures (of quality) of the creation fifty thousand years before He created the heavens and the earth, as His Throne was upon water. [2] وَعِندَهُۥ مَفَاتِحُ ٱلْغَيْبِ لَا يَعْلَمُهَآ إِلَّا هُوَ ۚ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا فِى ٱلْبَرِّ وَٱلْبَحْرِ ۚ وَمَا تَسْقُطُ مِن وَرَقَةٍ إِلَّا يَعْلَمُهَا وَلَا حَبَّةٍۢ فِى ظُلُمَـٰتِ ٱلْأَرْضِ وَلَا رَطْبٍۢ وَلَا يَابِسٍ إِلَّا فِى كِتَـٰبٍۢ مُّبِينٍۢWa indahoo mafaatihul ghaibi laa ya'lamuhaaa illaa Hoo; wa ya'lamu maa fil barri walbahr; wa maa tasqutu minw waraqatin illaa ya'lamuhaa wa laa habbatin fee zulumaatil ardi wa laa ratbinw wa laa yaabisin illaa fee Kitaabim MubeenEnglish Translation:""And with Him are the keys of the unseen; none knows them except Him. And He knows what is on the land and in the sea. Not a leaf falls but that He knows it. And no grain is there within the darknesses of the earth and no moist or dry [thing] but that it is [written] in a clear record."" — (Qur'an 6:50)Is your rizq decreed?The question arises, if rizq is decreed, then there can be no increase? Yes, and no. The problem which plagues us is awareness or consciousness. We fail to recognize or accept that our knowledge may be deficient/limited. So for all practical purposes, it is best to view qadr from our perspective as infinite possibilities. From Allah's perspective, there is only one since He has complete knowledge and knows the ending of all things, ""...with Him are the keys of the unseen; none knows them except Him.""A simple illustrative example, He may have decreed to the angels at birth to write for us $1,000,000, but at the end of our lifetime, it could have increased to $2,000,000 since His believer was devout and spread a lot of good into this world. The outcome of $2,000,000 was originally written and known by Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ, but it was not known to anyone else. As an analogy, a person watching a movie with a friend who hasn't seen the film knows all the plot twists and turns. And so, the most productive outlook we can have in such matters is approaching each day with our best foot forward. To try and go to bed a little wiser and to have some more good deeds under your belt than from when you first woke up. We need not complicate matters any further by thinking if my provision was decreed and it was guaranteed, then I can't do anything and should let things unfold and manifest. This is foolish thinking.Jabir reported: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ, peace and blessings be upon him, said, ""Were the son of Adam to flee from his provision as he flees from death, his provision would surely reach him just as death will reach him."" [3]Umar bin Al-Khattab narrated that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: ""If you were to rely upon Allah with the required reliance, then He would provide for you just as a bird is provided for, it goes out in the morning empty, and returns full."" [4]The hadith clearly mentions that the birds have to go out in the morning, each and every day, in search of their rizq. This signifies the importance of not neglecting your duty in taking action. (Make note we mention in the name Ar-Razzaq that rizq is of many types. Here we have been referring to it in the sense of the material). The hadith also does not neglect the role of seeking Allah's trust that He knows what's best for us. And so we turn to Him because we need Him. He is the source for which all things come forth, so we make du'a so to receive His blessings.We've been given many examples in the Qur'an of how rizq has been distributed and the ways in which it is received and deserved. For example, in the name Al-Qadir, we mentioned how Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ gave Prophet Zakariya (as) a child, despite His old age and His wife is barren. This is the qadr of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ but was only made a reality because of du'a, good deeds, and the righteous character of Prophet Zakariya (as). The Qur'an explicitly mentions, ""So We responded to him, and We gave him John, and amended for him his wife. Indeed, they used to hasten to good deeds and supplicate Us in hope and fear, and they were to Us humbly submissive.” (Qur'an 21:90).""Other ways include purifying our state by means of seeking His forgiveness, ""And said, 'Ask forgiveness of your Lord. Indeed, He is ever a Perpetual Forgiver. He will send [rain from] the sky upon you in [continuing] showers And give you increase in wealth and children and provide for you gardens and provide for you rivers."" (Qur'an 71:10-12) Also, Narrated Anas bin Malik: I heard Allah's Messenger ﷺ saying, ""whoever desires an expansion in his sustenance and age, should keep good relations with his Kith and kin.""[5] وَلَوۡ أَنَّ أَهۡلَ ٱلۡقُرَىٰٓ ءَامَنُواْ وَٱتَّقَوۡاْ لَفَتَحۡنَا عَلَيۡهِم بَرَكَٰتٖ مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ وَٱلۡأَرۡضِ وَلَٰكِن كَذَّبُواْ فَأَخَذۡنَٰهُم بِمَا كَانُواْ يَكۡسِبُونَWa law anna ahlal quraaa aamanoo wattaqaw lafatahnaa ‘alaihim barakaatim minas samaaa'i wal ardi wa laakin kazzaboo fa akhaznaahum bimaa kaanoo yaksiboonEnglish Translation:""And if only the people of the cities had believed and feared Allah, We would have opened upon them blessings from the heaven and the earth; but they denied [the messengers], so We seized them for what they were earning."" — (Qur'an 7:96)So in many ways, the believer benefits from knowing that Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Muqaddim. He has the power to bring forth many sweetnesses in our life. It could be that marriage you're searching for, the job that pays well and enables your family to be supported, or a beautiful, healthy child which you desire. Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ provides for all. Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet ﷺ said, ""Allah says: 'I am just as My slave thinks I am, (i.e., I am able to do for him what he thinks I can do for him) and I am with him if He remembers Me.[6]With regards to supplications which include the names Al-Muqaddim and Al-Mu'akhkhir, there are two mentioned in the hadith. We will mention one here and leave the other in the next section of Al-Mu'akhkhir.اللَّهُمَّ اغْفِرْ لِي خَطِيئَتِي وَجَهْلِي وَإِسْرَافِي فِي أَمْرِي وَمَا أَنْتَ أَعْلَمُ بِهِ مِنِّي اللَّهُمَّ اغْفِرْ لِي جِدِّي وَهَزْلِي وَخَطَئِي وَعَمْدِي وَكُلُّ ذَلِكَ عِنْدِي اللَّهُمَّ اغْفِرْ لِي مَا قَدَّمْتُ وَمَا أَخَّرْتُ وَمَا أَسْرَرْتُ وَمَا أَعْلَنْتُ وَمَا أَنْتَ أَعْلَمُ بِهِ مِنِّي أَنْتَ الْمُقَدِّمُ وَأَنْتَ الْمُؤَخِّرُ وَأَنْتَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌAllahummaghfirli Khati 'ati wa jahli wa israfi fi `Amri kullihi, wa ma anta a'lamu bihi minni.

الْمُؤَخِّرُ,Al-Mu'akhkhir / Al-Mu'akhir,The Delayer,"The Postponer, He Who Puts Far Away.","Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Mu'akhkhir (in Arabic: ٱلْمُؤَخِّرُ), The One who wisely delays or holds back. By His will, he can detain unbelievers and hold them back on the day of judgment.","From the root hamza-kha-ra (أ خ ر), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to cause, to go back, backwards, retreat, recede, to retire, to drive back, to put behind or after, to cause, to remain behind, hang back, lag behind, to postpone, put off, or delay.","Arabic Root:From the root hamza-kha-ra (أ خ ر), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to cause, to go back, backwards, retreat, recede, to retire, to drive back, to put behind or after, to cause, to remain behind, hang back, lag behind, to postpone, put off, or delay.The names Al-Mu'akhkhir and Al-Muqqadim are two names in this series that are closely connected and should be mentioned together for complete comprehension. Al-Muqqadim is The Promoter, or the one who brings forth, and the other is Al-Mu'akhkhir, The Postponer, or the one who pushes away.For this section, we will focus on what it means for Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ to be called by the name Al-Mu'akhkhir. You can also go back to the previous name, where we discuss Al-Muqqadim in more depth. The first interpretation is that Al-Mu'akhkhir is the one who pushes away whom He wills. Some of His creations are honored and promoted, like His angels, prophets, friends, and scholars. But the enemies of Islam He pushes away and banishes them. A clear example from the Qur'an would be the nation of 'Aad, ""And that was 'Aad, who rejected the signs of their Lord and disobeyed His messengers and followed the order of every obstinate tyrant. And they were [therefore] followed in this world with a curse and [as well] on the Day of Resurrection. Unquestionably, 'Aad denied their Lord; then away with 'Aad, the people of Hud."" (Qur'an 11:59-60) Du'a from hadith book:For the name Al-Muqqadim, no ayah in the Qur'an explicitly calls upon this name. Still, in the hadith corpus, we find a supplication that the Prophet ﷺ recites describing Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ as being ""anta-l-muqaddim"" and ""wa anta-l-mu akh-khir."" اللَّهُمَّ لَكَ الْحَمْدُ أَنْتَ قَيِّمُ السَّمَوَاتِ وَالأَرْضِ وَمَنْ فِيهِنَّ وَلَكَ الْحَمْدُ لَكَ مُلْكُ السَّمَوَاتِ وَالأَرْضِ وَمَنْ فِيهِنَّ وَلَكَ الْحَمْدُ أَنْتَ نُورُ السَّمَوَاتِ وَالأَرْضِ وَلَكَ الْحَمْدُ أَنْتَ الْحَقُّ وَوَعْدُكَ الْحَقُّ وَلِقَاؤُكَ حَقٌّ وَقَوْلُكَ حَقٌّ وَالْجَنَّةُ حَقٌّ وَالنَّارُ حَقٌّ وَالنَّبِيُّونَ حَقٌّ وَمُحَمَّدٌ صلى الله عليه وسلم حَقٌّ وَالسَّاعَةُ حَقٌّ اللَّهُمَّ لَكَ أَسْلَمْتُ وَبِكَ آمَنْتُ وَعَلَيْكَ تَوَكَّلْتُ وَإِلَيْكَ أَنَبْتُ وَبِكَ خَاصَمْتُ وَإِلَيْكَ حَاكَمْتُ فَاغْفِرْ لِي مَا قَدَّمْتُ وَمَا أَخَّرْتُ وَمَا أَسْرَرْتُ وَمَا أَعْلَنْتُ أَنْتَ الْمُقَدِّمُ وَأَنْتَ الْمُؤَخِّرُ لاَ إِلَهَ إِلاَّ أَنْتَAllahumma lakal-hamd.

Please forgive me my previous And future sins; And whatever I concealed or revealed And You are the One who make (some people) forward And (some) backward. There is none to be worshipped but you"" [1] A helpful Qur'anic verse:In the Qur'an, one verse refers to the words qaddama and wa akhkhar, which, if we analyze, can further help us understand the meaning of both names. يُنَبَّؤُاْ ٱلۡإِنسَٰنُ يَوۡمَئِذِۭ بِمَا قَدَّمَ وَأَخَّرَYunabba ul insaanu yawma 'izim bimaa qaddama wa akhkharEnglish Translation: ""Man will be informed that Day of what he sent ahead and kept back"" — (Qur'an 75:13)In this ayah, Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is instructing us to hasten to do good because on the day of resurrection, we will bring forth (qaddama) all of our deeds and they will testify to the good or bad that we've done. Next, it mentions (wa akhkhar), things we've left behind or kept back. This implies different meanings. Some commentators suggest it can mean leaving behind evil on earth, others interpret it in the affirmative, leaving behind a good legacy that perpetuates good for him even after he has returned to Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ (e.g., sadaqah jariyah - a perpetual, on-going charity).  Allah's Messenger ﷺ said: He who introduced some good practice in Islam which was followed after him (by people) he would be assured of reward like one who followed it, without their rewards being diminished in any respect. And he who introduced some evil practice in Islam which had been followed subsequently (by others), he would be required to bear the burden like that of one who followed this (evil practice) without their's being diminished in any respect.[2]Trials from the life of the Prophets:One thing that's important to understand is Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ doesn't just delay or demote things for quote-unquote 'bad people,' for lack of a better term. Some pious people are delayed in marriage or in having kids. Each person has their own fitnah (meaning trial or affliction) to the level Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ knows they're capable of shouldering. ""And We will surely test you with something of fear and hunger and a loss of wealth and lives and fruits, but give good tidings to the patient,"" (2:155), and ""Allah does not charge a soul except [with that within] its capacity."" (2:286) We must recognize He is Aleemul Hakeem, the all-knowing, the all-wise and see that things don't just happen, they happen just (i.e., by the will of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ).We can even briefly study the lives of the Prophets to understand how He delays even those closest to Him. For example, in the story of Prophet Ayyub (as) he lost everything in a great tragedy that killed all His children. In the account of Ibn Kathir:Satan once again visited Ayyub disguised as sympathising bystander, and remarked with sorrow, ""The circumstances under which your children died were sad. Surely, your Lord is not rewarding you properly for all your prayers."" Ayyub responded, ""Allah gives me what is good for me, and takes away what Allah sees that is displeasing for Him and for me. Allah sees that all of these children may be a strong test & trial for me, so Allah took them away from me. Whether a thing is beneficial or harmful to me, I will remain firm in my belief and remain thankful to my Creator."" The same can be said for Prophet Nuh (as). Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ showed mercy, He gave people every chance to listen and seek His guidance, but only a few did. Prophet Nuh (as) had to endure 950 years of preaching to an unreceptive and at times, hostile crowd, ""And We certainly sent Noah to his people, and he remained among them a thousand years minus fifty years, and the flood seized them while they were wrongdoers."" ( Qur'an 29:14) Even when the flood came from Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ a clear sign of their disobedience, Nuh (as) wife and son were still was among deniers and they drowned in the flood, ""[But the son] answered: ""I shall betake myself to a mountain that will protect me from the waters."" Said [Noah]: ""Today there is no protection [for anyone] from God's judgment, save [for] those who have earned [His] mercy!"" And a wave rose up between them, and [the son] was among those who were drowned"" ( Qur'an 11:43)Reflection:From these two names, Al-Muqaddim, and Al-Mu'akhkhir, the believer understands whether Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ decrees for us promotion or delay we must not waver in our faith. Wallaahu khairul maakireen, ""Allah is the best of planners."" ""Allah is the best of planners."" [3] We must accept His decree graciously and endure patiently, for there is wisdom in it. And if you have fallen back, do not despair, for Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Muqaddim, the one brings forward. This is why it's important to mention the names together. So as to not lose hope in Him. There is nothing that can't stop Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ mercy and to increase you in all aspects of living a good life. So never despair. As long as you are breathing Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ can improve your situation. As Prophet Ayyub said, ""I will remain firm in my belief and remain thankful to my Creator."" References:[1] Sahih al-Bukhari 1120[2] Sahih Muslim 1017e[3] Surah Imran Ayat 54 | ""And the disbelievers planned, but Allah planned. And Allah is the best of planners."" "
الأوَّلُ,Al-Awwal,The First,"The First, The Pre-Existing","Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Awwal (in Arabic: ٱلأَوَّلُ), He is The One whose existence is without beginning. He is truly the first, and nothing was before Him.","From the root hamza-waw-lam (أ و ل), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be first, principle, to be before, to come back to, to return, to precede, to be the first part, to be foremost.","Arabic Root:From the root hamza-waw-lam (أ و ل), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be first, principle, to be before, to come back to, to return, to precede, to be the first part, to be foremost.Tawhid & Tawakkul:The understanding and belief in the name establishes tawheed (oneness of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ). Al-Awwal means He was first or is the first. But this does not mean that there was nothing before. Rather the beginning was Him. He exists without a beginning and is the source from which everything comes into existence. From this name, we see how He is from ever and forever, and He is never absent and always present. It is a reminder we should rely upon Him alone (the concept of tawakkul).The First & The Last:Al-Awwal also implies an opposite. If there is a first, then there must be a last, and this is the name Al-Akhir. This does not mean that Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ has a beginning and an end. Instead, it tells us He is the start, and He is the end. It's the race of life; we start with Him and return to Him. In this race, some may try to take shortcuts only to get lost, and the wiser pace themselves, knowing it's a marathon. A few may try to trip or sabotage others to gain an advantage, but they fail to see the race is within themselves. There is no first or second-place prize. At the end of the journey, the satisfied will be those who gave their best effort; they struggled beautifully and gave it their all. For them will be the prize of the akhirah, Insha-Allah. You don't want to have reached the end of the race to realize you had much more to offer; you want to be tired at the end.In The Name & the Named, Sheikh Tosun Bayrak writes, ""It is proper to read, recite, and consider the attributes ""The First"" and ""The Last"" together because the meaning is like a circle where the first and the last are one."" This interpretation seems to describe these two names accurately. Imam Ghazali mentions something similar, ""So He is last with respect to wayfaring [there is nothing that will succeed him], and first with respect to existence: the first beginning was from Him; and to Him is the last return and destination."" هُوَ ٱلۡأَوَّلُ وَٱلۡأٓخِرُ وَٱلظَّـٰهِرُ وَٱلۡبَاطِنُۖ وَهُوَ بِكُلِّ شَيۡءٍ عَلِيمٌHuwal Awwalu wal'Aakhiru waz Zaahiru wal Baatinu wa huwa bikulli shai'in AleemEnglish Translation:""He is the First and the Last, the Ascendant and the Intimate, and He is, of all things, Knowing."" — (Qur'an 57:3) ٱلَّذِينَ  إِذَآ  أَصَٰبَتۡهُم  مُّصِيبَةٞ  قَالُوٓاْ  إِنَّا  لِلَّهِ  وَإِنَّآ  إِلَيۡهِ  رَٰجِعُونَAllazeena izaaa asaabathum museebatun qaalooo innaa lillaahi wa innaaa ilaihi raaji'oonEnglish Translation:""Who, when disaster strikes them, say, 'Indeed we belong to Allah, and indeed to Him we will return.'"" — (Qur'an 2:156)The case of the curious mind:It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: Men will continue to question one another till this is propounded: Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ created all things but who created Allah? He who found himself confronted with such a situation should say: I affirm my faith in Allah. [1]To those with a curious minds, we can't fathom how something can exist from nothing. We're so ingrained by our experiences as to seeing how one thing gives birth to another that we ask the same question of God. But as Prophet ﷺ tells the companions who ask Him this question, he replies that it's a matter of faith. The Qur'an addresses the hypocrites and the disbelievers in many verses. For example: أَوَلَمْ يَكْفِهِمْ أَنَّآ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْكَ ٱلْكِتَـٰبَ يُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْهِمْ ۚ إِنَّ فِى ذَٰلِكَ لَرَحْمَةًۭ وَذِكْرَىٰ لِقَوْمٍۢ يُؤْمِنُونَAwa lam yakfihim annaaa anzalnaa 'alaikal kitaaba yutlaa 'alaihim; inna fee zaalika larahmatanw wa zikraa liqawminy yu'minoon (section 5)English Translation:""And is it not sufficient for them that We revealed to you the Book which is recited to them? Indeed in that is a mercy and reminder for a people who believe."" — (Qur'an 29:51)The human mind has many limitations, and we often fool ourselves. We don't know what we don't know, and we can't know the limits of how our intelligence may be bounded. A lot of psychological work has been done to show the many ways in which we're unreliable narrators. One such fallacy is the illusion of explanatory depth (IOED). If we look at the simplest of things we use every day and try to explain in detail how they work, we quickly realize that much of our knowledge is surface level. For example, what's a toilet? We likely answer with confidence what seems to be a silly question. Of course, we know what it is and how to operate one, but when you press the flush button, what's really happening underneath the tank? That's what makes the toilet a toilet. It seems like a strange analogy, but the point is we are often unaware of our ignorance, yet we ask irrelevant questions of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ that we cannot comprehend. And so, the answer Prophet Muhammad ﷺ gives just may be the most intelligent answer to the question.Supplication from hadith using these two names:There is a nice du'a mentioned in the hadith literature, which tells us what he would sometimes recite before going to bed. In this du'a, it asks for debts and desires to be cleared so he may rest in peace. He ﷺ calls upon these two names Al-Awwal and Al-Akhir, and we've highlighted them for your reference.اللَّهُمَّ رَبَّ السَّمَوَاتِ وَرَبَّ الأَرْضِ وَرَبَّ الْعَرْشِ الْعَظِيمِ رَبَّنَا وَرَبَّ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ فَالِقَ الْحَبِّ وَالنَّوَى وَمُنْزِلَ التَّوْرَاةِ وَالإِنْجِيلِ وَالْفُرْقَانِ أَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنْ شَرِّ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ أَنْتَ آخِذٌ بِنَاصِيَتِهِ اللَّهُمَّ أَنْتَ الأَوَّلُ فَلَيْسَ قَبْلَكَ شَىْءٌ وَأَنْتَ الآخِرُ فَلَيْسَ بَعْدَكَ شَىْءٌ وَأَنْتَ الظَّاهِرُ فَلَيْسَ فَوْقَكَ شَىْءٌ وَأَنْتَ الْبَاطِنُ فَلَيْسَ دُونَكَ شَىْءٌ اقْضِ عَنَّا الدَّيْنَ وَأَغْنِنَا مِنَ الْفَقْرِ  Suhail reported that Abu Salih used to command us (in these words): When any one of you intends to go to sleep, he should lie on the bed on his right side and then say: ""O Allah. the Lord of the Heavens and the Lord of the Earth and Lord of the Magnificent Throne, our Lord, and the Lord of evervthing, the Splitter of the grain of corn and the datestone (or fruit kernal), the Revealer of Torah and Injil (Bible) and Criterion (the Holy Qur'an), I seek refuge in Thee from the evil of every - thing Thou art to sieze by the forelock (Thou hast perfect control over it).

الآخِرُ,Al-Akhir,The Last,"The Last, The End, The Endless.","Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Akhir (in Arabic: ٱلْآخِرُ), The One whose existence will extend past the end of this universe. He will be the last, just as He is the first.","NOTE: If you are reading the 99 names of Allah guide in order, then much of what's been written here is the same as Al-Awwal as these names have been explained in pairs.

He who found himself confronted with such a situation should say: I affirm my faith in Allah. [1]To those with a curious minds, we can't fathom how something can exist from nothing. We're so ingrained by our experiences as to seeing how one thing gives birth to another that we ask the same question of God. But as Prophet ﷺ tells the companions who ask Him this question, he replies that it's a matter of faith. The Qur'an addresses the hypocrites and the disbelievers in many verses. For example: أَوَلَمْ يَكْفِهِمْ أَنَّآ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْكَ ٱلْكِتَـٰبَ يُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْهِمْ ۚ إِنَّ فِى ذَٰلِكَ لَرَحْمَةًۭ وَذِكْرَىٰ لِقَوْمٍۢ يُؤْمِنُونَAwa lam yakfihim annaaa anzalnaa 'alaikal kitaaba yutlaa 'alaihim; inna fee zaalika larahmatanw wa zikraa liqawminy yu'minoon (section 5)English Translation:""And is it not sufficient for them that We revealed to you the Book which is recited to them? Indeed in that is a mercy and reminder for a people who believe."" — (Qur'an 29:51)The human mind has many limitations, and we often fool ourselves. We don't know what we don't know, and we can't know the limits of how our intelligence may be bounded. A lot of psychological work has been done to show the many ways in which we're unreliable narrators. One such fallacy is the illusion of explanatory depth (IOED). If we look at the simplest of things we use every day and try to explain in detail how they work, we quickly realize that much of our knowledge is surface level. For example, what's a toilet? We likely answer with confidence what seems to be a silly question. Of course, we know what it is and how to operate one, but when you press the flush button, what's really happening underneath the tank? That's what makes the toilet a toilet. It seems like a strange analogy, but the point is we are often unaware of our ignorance, yet we ask irrelevant questions of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ that we cannot comprehend. And so, the answer Prophet Muhammad ﷺ gives just may be the most intelligent answer to the question.Supplication from hadith using these two names:There is a nice du'a mentioned in the hadith literature, which tells us what he would sometimes recite before going to bed. In this du'a, it asks for debts and desires to be cleared so he may rest in peace. He ﷺ calls upon these two names Al-Awwal and Al-Akhir, and we've highlighted them for your reference.اللَّهُمَّ رَبَّ السَّمَوَاتِ وَرَبَّ الأَرْضِ وَرَبَّ الْعَرْشِ الْعَظِيمِ رَبَّنَا وَرَبَّ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ فَالِقَ الْحَبِّ وَالنَّوَى وَمُنْزِلَ التَّوْرَاةِ وَالإِنْجِيلِ وَالْفُرْقَانِ أَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنْ شَرِّ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ أَنْتَ آخِذٌ بِنَاصِيَتِهِ اللَّهُمَّ أَنْتَ الأَوَّلُ فَلَيْسَ قَبْلَكَ شَىْءٌ وَأَنْتَ الآخِرُ فَلَيْسَ بَعْدَكَ شَىْءٌ وَأَنْتَ الظَّاهِرُ فَلَيْسَ فَوْقَكَ شَىْءٌ وَأَنْتَ الْبَاطِنُ فَلَيْسَ دُونَكَ شَىْءٌ اقْضِ عَنَّا الدَّيْنَ وَأَغْنِنَا مِنَ الْفَقْرِ  Suhail reported that Abu Salih used to command us (in these words): When any one of you intends to go to sleep, he should lie on the bed on his right side and then say: ""O Allah. the Lord of the Heavens and the Lord of the Earth and Lord of the Magnificent Throne, our Lord, and the Lord of evervthing, the Splitter of the grain of corn and the datestone (or fruit kernal), the Revealer of Torah and Injil (Bible) and Criterion (the Holy Qur'an), I seek refuge in Thee from the evil of every - thing Thou art to sieze by the forelock (Thou hast perfect control over it). O Allah, Thou art the First, there is naught before Thee, and Thou art the Last and there is naught after Thee, and Thou art Evident and there is nothing above Thee, and Thou art Innermost and there is nothing beyond Thee. Remove the burden of debt from us and relieve us from want."" Abu Salih used to narrate it from Abu Huraira who narrated it from Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) [2]References:[1] Sahih Muslim 134a[2] Sahih Muslim 2713a"
الظَّاهِرُ,Az-Zahir / Adh-Dhaahir / Ath-Thahir,The Manifest,"The Conspicuous, The Evident, The Outward","Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Az-Zaahir (in Arabic: ٱلْظَّاهِرُ), The One who is evident and conspicuous. He made himself evident without being visible. The very essence and attributes are shown through all His creations.","From the root za-ha-ra (ظ ه ر), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be visible, manifest, obvious, clear, distinct, to open, to come out, to cause, to appear after being concealed, to be conspicuous, distinct, to ascend, mount, have higher status, to have the upper hand, subdue, overcome, to endorse, help, aid, support others, render superior.","Arabic Root:From the root za-ha-ra (ظ ه ر), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be visible, manifest, obvious, clear, distinct, to open, to come out, to cause, to appear after being concealed, to be conspicuous, distinct, to ascend, mount, have higher status, to have the upper hand, subdue, overcome, to endorse, help, aid, support others, render superior.Mentioning the names together is necessary for this pair because to say Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is hidden by itself can imply a negative connotation. In Surah Hadid, there is one short ayah which mentions four of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ divine names. هُوَ ٱلْأَوَّلُ وَٱلْـَٔاخِرُ وَٱلظَّـٰهِرُ وَٱلْبَاطِنُ ۖ وَهُوَ بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ عَلِيمٌHuwal Awwalu wal'Aakhiru waz Zaahiru wal Baatinu wa huwa bikulli shai'in AleemSAHIH INTERNATIONAL:""He is the First and the Last, the Ascendant and the Intimate, and He is, of all things, Knowing."" ABUL ALA MAUDUDI:He is the First and the Last, and the Manifest and the Hidden, and He has knowledge of everything. DR.GHALI:He is The First and The Last, and The Outward and The Inward; (Or: The Topmost and The Innermost) and He is Ever-Knowing of everything.  — (Qur'an 57:3) The four names in this verse are best viewed in pairs for their connected meaning. The first pairing is Al-Awwal and Al-Akhir (The First and The Last). The following two names which will be the focus of this section are Az-Zahir and Al-Batin (The Manifest, The Hidden). We included three different translations of this ayah to help us see understand the nuances.A pairing paradox:At first, the pairing of Al-Zahir and Al-Batin seems contradictory. How can something be both manifest yet hidden? One interpretation is He is outwardly manifested, all that exists serves as clear proof of His manifestation, as well as His knowledge and His power. But He is hidden in plain sight, He appears before everything, and it should be apparent, but they ignore the truth presented right in front of them. Another view of Al-Zahir that is also reflected in the translations is that He is transcendent above all, predominating over them. He is High above, a clear witness over everything, and He knows all which is concealed or hidden. He is fully acquainted with His servants and knows their inner dimensions.Imam Ghazali mentions these two attributes that Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is manifest and hidden, referring to the mode of perception. If you need to ""see it to believe it,"" you will surely miss Him. But if you find the ways in which He manifests Himself through the Prophets (may peace be upon them), His books, religion, power, knowledge, and all the ways He's supplied blessings for you, you will surely find Him. Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is ""hidden when He is sought by sensory perception or using the resources of imagination, yet manifest when sought by way of inference using the resources of reason."" لَّا تُدْرِكُهُ ٱلْأَبْصَـٰرُ وَهُوَ يُدْرِكُ ٱلْأَبْصَـٰرَ ۖ وَهُوَ ٱللَّطِيفُ ٱلْخَبِيرُLaa tudrikuhul absaaru wa Huwa yudrikul absaara wa huwal Lateeful KhabeerEnglish Translation:""Vision perceives Him not, but He perceives [all] vision; and He is the Subtle, the Acquainted."" — (Qur'an 6:103)Seeing Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ:This is also a topic of discussion Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ had with Musa (as) as captured in the Qur'an. Musa (as) is the only person we know to have communicated directly with Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. In his conversation, he asked if the veil which separates God from us could be lifted so that he may see Him. Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ told Musa (as) He cannot be seen and then demonstrated why by revealing Himself to a nearby mountain. Upon doing so, the mountain turned to ashes/dust and was leveled. The whole experience caused Musa (as) to collapse unconscious. وَلَمَّا جَآءَ مُوسَىٰ لِمِيقَٰتِنَا وَكَلَّمَهُۥ رَبُّهُۥ قَالَ رَبِّ أَرِنِيٓ أَنظُرۡ إِلَيۡكَۚ قَالَ لَن تَرَىٰنِي وَلَٰكِنِ ٱنظُرۡ إِلَى ٱلۡجَبَلِ فَإِنِ ٱسۡتَقَرَّ مَكَانَهُۥ فَسَوۡفَ تَرَىٰنِيۚ فَلَمَّا تَجَلَّىٰ رَبُّهُۥ لِلۡجَبَلِ جَعَلَهُۥ دَكّٗا وَخَرَّ مُوسَىٰ صَعِقٗاۚ فَلَمَّآ أَفَاقَ قَالَ سُبۡحَٰنَكَ تُبۡتُ إِلَيۡكَ وَأَنَا۠ أَوَّلُ ٱلۡمُؤۡمِنِينَWa lammaa jaaa'a Moosa limeeqaatinaa wa kallamahoo Rabbuhoo qaala Rabbi arineee anzur ilaik; qaala lan taraanee wa laakininzur ilal jabali fa inistaqarra makaanahoo fasawfa taraanee; falammaa tajallaa Rabbuhoo liljabali ja'alahoo dakkanw wa kharra Moosaa sa'iqaa; falammaaa afaaqa qaala Subhaanaka tubtu ilaika wa ana awwalul mu'mineenEnglish Translation:""And when Moses arrived at Our appointed time and his Lord spoke to him, he said, 'My Lord, show me [Yourself] that I may look at You.'

Indeed, He is Most High and Wise."" — (Qur'an 42:51)Al-Ghazali gives an illustrative example of how, if you read a page of a book, would you doubt that the author exists? Or would you recognize the author's existence for the book to exist? We could go one step further and infer from what was written that they were knowledgeable and assume they had the qualities of sight and hearing. [1] Now, if you take a second to ponder the arrangement of the universe. See all its perfectly managed complexity. Why do you need to see the organizer to validate His existence? The creation and perfect arrangement of all the atoms and molecules, everything around us, is a clear manifest proof of His existence. It speaks volumes about all of His glorious attributes. Even we can see the wisdom in His book, Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ had authored all of creation, kun fa-yakoon, ""'Be', and it is!"" (Qur'an 36:82). This also brings us back to the first pairing we mentioned (Al-Awwal and Al-Akhir), recognizing Him as the originator or the source for all creation.It was narrated from Umar that Jibreel عليه السلام said to the Prophet ﷺ: What is faith (iman)? He said: “To believe in Allah, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers, the Last Day and the divine decree, both good and bad,” Jibreel said to him: You have spoken the truth. He said: We were amazed that he asked him and then confirmed his answers as being correct. The Prophet ﷺ said: ""That was Jībreel, who came to teach you your religion.`"" [2]It is also worth mentioning that Surah Al-An'am ayah 120 notes two Arabic words, zaahiral and baatinah, but not in the context of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ glorious names. Rather, these words were a message to the believers about what is permissible and forbidden. It gives clear guidance to avoid sinning, whether open (zaahiral) or hidden (baatinah). وَذَرُواْ ظَٰهِرَ ٱلۡإِثۡمِ وَبَاطِنَهُۥٓۚ إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يَكۡسِبُونَ ٱلۡإِثۡمَ سَيُجۡزَوۡنَ بِمَا كَانُواْ يَقۡتَرِفُونَWa zaroo zaahiral ismi wa baatinah; innal lazeena yaksiboonal ismaa sa yujzawna bimaa kaanoo yaqtarifoonABDEL HALEEM TRANSLATION:""Avoid committing sin, whether openly or in secret, for those who commit sin will be repaid for what they do,"" — (Qur'an 6:120)Du'a of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ:There is also mention of these two names as recorded in a du'a of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ:اللَّهُمَّ رَبَّ السَّمَوَاتِ وَرَبَّ الأَرْضِ وَرَبَّ الْعَرْشِ الْعَظِيمِ رَبَّنَا وَرَبَّ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ فَالِقَ الْحَبِّ وَالنَّوَى وَمُنْزِلَ التَّوْرَاةِ وَالإِنْجِيلِ وَالْفُرْقَانِ أَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنْ شَرِّ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ أَنْتَ آخِذٌ بِنَاصِيَتِهِ اللَّهُمَّ أَنْتَ الأَوَّلُ فَلَيْسَ قَبْلَكَ شَىْءٌ وَأَنْتَ الآخِرُ فَلَيْسَ بَعْدَكَ شَىْءٌ وَأَنْتَ الظَّاهِرُفَلَيْسَ فَوْقَكَ شَىْءٌ وَأَنْتَ الْبَاطِنُ فَلَيْسَ دُونَكَ شَىْءٌ اقْضِ عَنَّا الدَّيْنَ وَأَغْنِنَا مِنَ الْفَقْرAllahumma Rabbas-samawati wa Rabbal-ardi, wa Rabbul-'Arshil-'Azim, Rabbana wa Rabba kulli shay, faliqal-habbi wan-nawa, wa munzilat-Tawrati wal-Injili wal-furqan.

It gives clear guidance to avoid sinning, whether open (zaahiral) or hidden (baatinah). وَذَرُواْ ظَٰهِرَ ٱلۡإِثۡمِ وَبَاطِنَهُۥٓۚ إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يَكۡسِبُونَ ٱلۡإِثۡمَ سَيُجۡزَوۡنَ بِمَا كَانُواْ يَقۡتَرِفُونَWa zaroo zaahiral ismi wa baatinah; innal lazeena yaksiboonal ismaa sa yujzawna bimaa kaanoo yaqtarifoonABDEL HALEEM TRANSLATION:""Avoid committing sin, whether openly or in secret, for those who commit sin will be repaid for what they do,"" (Qur'an 6:120)Du'a of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ:There is also mention of these two names as recorded in a du'a of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ:اللَّهُمَّ رَبَّ السَّمَوَاتِ وَرَبَّ الأَرْضِ وَرَبَّ الْعَرْشِ الْعَظِيمِ رَبَّنَا وَرَبَّ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ فَالِقَ الْحَبِّ وَالنَّوَى وَمُنْزِلَ التَّوْرَاةِ وَالإِنْجِيلِ وَالْفُرْقَانِ أَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنْ شَرِّ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ أَنْتَ آخِذٌ بِنَاصِيَتِهِ اللَّهُمَّ أَنْتَ الأَوَّلُ فَلَيْسَ قَبْلَكَ شَىْءٌ وَأَنْتَ الآخِرُ فَلَيْسَ بَعْدَكَ شَىْءٌ وَأَنْتَ الظَّاهِرُفَلَيْسَ فَوْقَكَ شَىْءٌ وَأَنْتَ الْبَاطِنُ فَلَيْسَ دُونَكَ شَىْءٌ اقْضِ عَنَّا الدَّيْنَ وَأَغْنِنَا مِنَ الْفَقْرAllahumma Rabbas-samawati wa Rabbal-ardi, wa Rabbul-'Arshil-'Azim, Rabbana wa Rabba kulli shay, faliqal-habbi wan-nawa, wa munzilat-Tawrati wal-Injili wal-furqan.

الْوَالِي,Al-Wali,The Holder of Supreme Authority,"The Governor, The Ruler.","Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Waali (in Arabic: ٱلْوَالِي), The One who is the sole planner and governor of all things. He is fully supportive, helpful, and a master of all. He manages and disposes of things at His will based on His judgment.","From the root waw-lam-ya (و ل ي), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be near, close, nearby to be a friend, helper, supporter, maintainer, to defend, guard (lit. friendly dealing), to be in charge, to turn one toward something, to be the master, owner, lord.","Arabic Root:From the root waw-lam-ya (و ل ي), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be near, close, nearby to be a friend, helper, supporter, maintainer, to defend, guard (lit. friendly dealing), to be in charge, to turn one toward something, to be the master, owner, lord.Among the disputed names:As we've mentioned in previous names, different scholars have different criteria for what qualifies as a name of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. Of the 99 names, 81 are explicitly mentioned in the Qur'an. Therefore, there isn't one agreed-upon list for the remaining 18 names. Al-Wali is one of those names that is deduced and, therefore, not included on the list of certain scholars. This includes Ibn Mandah, Ibn Hazm, and Ibn Hajar, among others. However, others, such as Imam al-Bayhaqi and Imam al-Ghazali, have included this name in their lists. Note as an attribute to describe Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ it is valid.To be a ruler...This name is also not to be confused with one we've already discussed in Al-Waliyy (ٱلْوَلِيُّ) - The Protecting Associate. Here Al-Wali (ٱلْوَالِي) refers to being the ruler or guardian, and this encompasses three qualities. Imam Ghazali mentions that being a governor requires organization, power, and action. Failure in any of these respects relinquishes the title of being called the true ruler.Below are just a few verses that mention Allah's complete dominion. It demonstrates how He is the best planner, the all-powerful king, and the one who manages the affairs of all things.From the Qur'an:There are no direct mentions of the name Al-Wali, but we can understand this attribute further by verses that describe this quality from the Qur'an. وَإِذۡ يَمۡكُرُ بِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لِيُثۡبِتُوكَ أَوۡ يَقۡتُلُوكَ أَوۡ يُخۡرِجُوكَۚ وَيَمۡكُرُونَ وَيَمۡكُرُ ٱللَّهُۖ وَٱللَّهُ خَيۡرُ ٱلۡمَٰكِرِينَWa iz yamkuru bikal lazeena kafaroo liyusbitooka aw yaqtulooka aw yukhrijook; wa yamkuroona wa yamkurul laahu wallaahu khairul maakireenEnglish Translation:""And [remember, O Muhammad], when those who disbelieved plotted against you to restrain you or kill you or evict you [from Makkah].

Those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide eternally therein."" — (Qur'an 2:257)Reflection:The believer benefits from knowing that Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Wali. He understands that real control comes from the commandments of whatever Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ wills. No one can dictate otherwise. It should further solidify the notion of reliance upon Him for all matters. He is the one who organizes the plan, puts it into action, and then preserves it. Shaykh Tosun Barak writes, ""the whole of creation is governed by Allah's knowledge and power: not a leaf moves without His will. Neither is the movement of the leaf disconnected from other things moved by the same wind, by the same will.""So all matters are in the care of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ, our being is part of a divine order He has planned. He is Al-Wali (The Ruler) and Al-Waliyy (The Protecting Associate). But one must realize that what may be good for you may not be in the way you want. Each caliphate asked Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ for wellbeing and protection, yet Umar Ibn Al-Khattab (ra) was martyred. Even Ali ibn Abi Talib (ra) was killed and martyred. Some may wonder about the justice in that, but the real reward is in the hereafter. The reward of one's actions is not necessarily manifested in this life. If it is, that is a blessing or a gift from Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ, but it shouldn't be the primary motivation.It was narrated that Sa'eed bin Zaid bin 'Amr bin Nufail said:""The Messenger of Allah was one of the Ten (given glad tidings of Paradise). He said: 'Abu Bakr will be in Paradise; 'Umar will be in Paradise; 'Uthman will be in Paradise; 'Ali will be in Paradise; Talhah will be in Paradise; Zubair will be in Paradise; Sa'd will be in Paradise; 'Abdur-Rahman will be in Paradise."" He was asked: 'Who will be the ninth?' He said: 'I will.'"" [1]Reflections:[1] Sahih (Darussalam) Sunan Ibn Majah 133 & Sunan Abi Dawud 4649"
الْمُتَعَالِي,Al-Mutaʿali,The Self Exalted,"The Supremely Exalted, The All Exalted","Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Muta'ali (in Arabic: ٱلْمُتَعَالِي), The highest One, and exalted above all creation. He is far beyond any imagination or thought, and the human mind is too narrow to understand his true greatness.","From the root ayn-lam-waw (ع ل و), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be high, elevated, lofty, to be exalted, to rise up, to ascend, to be higher to exceed, surpass, to overcome, overwhelm to advance, promote, rise above, to mount, be overtop, eminent.","Arabic Root:From the root ayn-lam-waw (ع ل و), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be high, elevated, lofty, to be exalted, to rise up, to ascend, to be higher to exceed, surpass, to overcome, overwhelm to advance, promote, rise above, to mount, be overtop, eminent.Much of what needs to be said regarding this name has been covered in the name Al-Aliyy. Al-Aliyy means ""The High"" or ""The Exalted."" Al-Muta'ali is related to this name, but its meaning is intensified. So, He is ""The Most High"" or the ""Supremely Exalted."" Dr. Sayyed Mohammad Reza, in his book titled ""Divine Names & Attributes In The Holy Qur'an,""Allah the Exalted is 'Ali because to Him belongs highness and all of its aspects, highness of His Essence, highness of His attributes and esteem, Highness of strength and power. He is the one who has risen over His throne and the who has encompassed the dominion. He is the one who and whom all attributes of greatness, grandness, magnificence, and beauty find perfection and fulfillment.""As a reminder, there are three forms of which we should be aware of Al-Aliyy (The High), Al-Ala (The Most High), and Al-Muta'ali (The Highest). Each successive name goes into a more exaggeratory form. Together they characterize Allah's loftiness, Him being the High above in all respects (i.e., might, wisdom, knowledge, judgment, power, etc.). إِلَّا ٱبۡتِغَآءَ وَجۡهِ رَبِّهِ ٱلۡأَعۡلَىٰIllab tighaaa'a wajhi rabbihil a'laaEnglish Translation:""But only seeking the countenance of his Lord, Most High."" — (Qur'an 93:20) ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ هُوَ ٱلۡحَقُّ وَأَنَّ مَا يَدۡعُونَ مِن دُونِهِۦ هُوَ ٱلۡبَٰطِلُ وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ هُوَ ٱلۡعَلِيُّ ٱلۡكَبِيرُZaalika bi annal laaha Huwal haqqu wa anna maa yad'oona min doonihee huwal baatilu wa annal laaha Huwal ‘Aliyyul kabeerEnglish Translation:""That is because Allah is the Truth, and that which they call upon other than Him is falsehood, and because Allah is the Most High, the Grand."" — (Qur'an 22:62) لَهُۥ مَا فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِي ٱلۡأَرۡضِۖ وَهُوَ ٱلۡعَلِيُّ ٱلۡعَظِيمُLahoo maa fis samaa waati wa maa fil ardi wa Huwal ‘Aliyul ‘AzeemEnglish Translation:""To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth, and He is the Most High, the Most Great."" — (Qur'an 42:4) أَمَّن يَهۡدِيكُمۡ فِي ظُلُمَٰتِ ٱلۡبَرِّ وَٱلۡبَحۡرِ وَمَن يُرۡسِلُ ٱلرِّيَٰحَ بُشۡرَۢا بَيۡنَ يَدَيۡ رَحۡمَتِهِۦٓۗ أَءِلَٰهٞ مَّعَ ٱللَّهِۚ تَعَٰلَى ٱللَّهُ عَمَّا يُشۡرِكُونَAmmany-yahdeekum fee zulumaatil barri wal bahri wa many yursilu riyaaha bushran baina yadai rahmatih; ‘a-ilaahun ma'allah; Ta'aalal laahu ‘ammaa yushrikoonEnglish Translation:""Is He [not best] who guides you through the darknesses of the land and sea and who sends the winds as good tidings before His mercy?

Abdullah ibn 'Amr reported that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, ""The one who maintains ties of kinship is not the one who reciprocates. The one who maintains ties of kinship is the one who, when his relatives cut him off, maintains ties of kinship.""  [1] The reason to keep trying is none other but for the sake of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. There is no blame on oneself or the wrongs of the other person. The focus and comfort should come from knowing you're behaving in a manner that is pleasing to Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ.Reflection:[1] Sahih (Al-Albani) Al-Adab Al-Mufrad 68"
الْبَرُّ,Al-Barr,The Source of All Goodness,"The Beneficent One, The Doer of Good, The All Pure.","Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Barr (in Arabic: ٱلْبَرُّ), The One who is the great benefactor, the most righteous, and the source of goodness. He is ample in kindness and desires good for people bestowing them with health, wealth, and happiness. He is ever merciful and compassionate. He is The One who covered them with His sustenance and specified whoever He willed among them by His support, protection, and special mercy.","From the root ba-ra-ra (ب ر ر), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be devoted, affectionate, gentle to be just and proper, honest, truthful, have regard for the circumstances of another, to be beneficent, to bestow bountiful gifts, to reward for service, recompense, to behave courteously, to do good, to be benign, gracious, kindly, to be pious, virtuous, righteous to be ample, extensive.","Arabic Root:From the root ba-ra-ra (ب ر ر), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be devoted, affectionate, gentle to be just and proper, honest, truthful, have regard for the circumstances of another, to be beneficent, to bestow bountiful gifts, to reward for service, recompense, to behave courteously, to do good, to be benign, gracious, kindly, to be pious, virtuous, righteous to be ample, extensive.The name Al-Barr occurs once in the Qur'an. إِنَّا كُنَّا مِن قَبۡلُ نَدۡعُوهُۖ إِنَّهُۥ هُوَ ٱلۡبَرُّ ٱلرَّحِيمُInnaa kunnaa min qablu nad'oohu innahoo huwal barrur raheemEnglish Translation:""Indeed, we used to supplicate Him before. Indeed, it is He who is the Beneficent, the Merciful.”"" — (Qur'an 52:28)This name of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ, Al-Barr, speaks to His essences of kindness, generosity, and mercy. To enumerate His kindness is an impossible task. We will never be able to grasp all the ways in which He has blessed us. If we were to show our gratitude, it would never be enough. There are just so many layers to His mercy and kindness: His gift of creation, to instill in us a soul, to protect us every day from harm, to give us the earth and the ability to enjoy all its fruits, to listen and answer our prayers, to forgive our sins and give us a multiplicative reward for our good. He's given us guidance through His Prophets (may peace be upon them) and His book so we can live a purposeful life instead of meandering about aimlessly. He had no obligation to make the path to Him so clear. The path to Him could've been hard, reserved only for the rare truth seekers. Truly, Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is the doer of good and most compassionate. In Surah Baqarah verse 185, ""Allah intends for you ease and does not intend for you hardship."" شَهۡرُ  رَمَضَانَ  ٱلَّذِيٓ  أُنزِلَ  فِيهِ  ٱلۡقُرۡءَانُ  هُدٗى  لِّلنَّاسِ  وَبَيِّنَٰتٖ  مِّنَ  ٱلۡهُدَىٰ  وَٱلۡفُرۡقَانِۚ  فَمَن  شَهِدَ  مِنكُمُ  ٱلشَّهۡرَ  فَلۡيَصُمۡهُۖ  وَمَن  كَانَ  مَرِيضًا  أَوۡ  عَلَىٰ  سَفَرٖ  فَعِدَّةٞ  مِّنۡ  أَيَّامٍ  أُخَرَۗ  يُرِيدُ  ٱللَّهُ  بِكُمُ  ٱلۡيُسۡرَ  وَلَا  يُرِيدُ  بِكُمُ  ٱلۡعُسۡرَ  وَلِتُكۡمِلُواْ  ٱلۡعِدَّةَ  وَلِتُكَبِّرُواْ  ٱللَّهَ  عَلَىٰ  مَا  هَدَىٰكُمۡ  وَلَعَلَّكُمۡ  تَشۡكُرُونَShahru Ramadaanallazeee unzila feehil Qur'aanu hudal linnaasi wa baiyinaatim minal hudaa wal furqaan; faman shahida minkumush shahra falyasumhu wa man kaana mareedan aw ‘alaa safarin fa'iddatum min ayyaamin ukhar; yureedul laahu bikumul yusra wa laa yureedu bikumul ‘usra wa litukmilul ‘iddata wa litukabbirul laaha ‘alaa maa hadaakum wa la'allakum tashkuroonEnglish Translation:""The month of Ramadhan [is that] in which was revealed the Qur'an, a guidance for the people and clear proofs of guidance and criterion.

Allah intends for you ease and does not intend for you hardship and [wants] for you to complete the period and to glorify Allah for that [to] which He has guided you; and perhaps you will be grateful."" — (Qur'an 2:185)Even in the treatment of good deeds versus bad. You would think a just God would reward an action based on its merit, but Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is greater. He is Ar-Rahman (The Beneficent) and Ar-Raheem (The Merciful). The Prophet ﷺ speaks of how if you intended to do a good deed, but for whatever reason, it was not done, you will have written for you, by the angels, a good deed. But this does not discourage from the actual act because The Prophet ﷺ speaks of how if you intended to do a good deed, but for whatever reason it was not done, you will have written for you, by the angels, a good deed. But this does not discourage from the actual act, because ""if he intends to do a good deed and actually did it, then Allah will write for him with Him from ten to seven hundred times to many more times."" However, the same standard is not applied for bad or evil thoughts, it will not be recorded until put into action. [1]The believer benefits from knowing that Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Barr. He sees the kindness of His Lord, which increases his love and gratitude towards Him. We understand how His mercy will always be available if sought after. Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is clear and true in His promise if we do certain things, He will grant us what we seek. Furthermore, upon reflecting on this name, we ask ourselves, how can we be among the doers of good? A'isha, the wife of Allah's Apostle ﷺ, reported that Allah's Messenger ﷺ said: A'isha, verily Allah is kind and He loves kindness and confers upon kindness which he does not confer upon severity and does not confer upon anything else besides it (kindness). [2]Why withhold kindness? Why withhold the goodness and ripple effects it can create? Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ tells us He loves kindness and rewards His servant when he's in service to others. Hearing the right thing at the right time can have a profound effect on the trajectory of a person's life. It can unlock dreams unimagined. Words of encouragement can give courage and strength to one suffering, almost like a cure to an illness or a plant in need of water. But of course, the other side of the coin reads words can create havoc if we're not careful. Fights, wars, and ties of kinships have all been severed just from the movement of the tongue. It is more powerful than we like to give it credit. Narrated Abu Musa: Some people asked Allah's Messenger ﷺ, ""Whose Islam is the best? (I.e., Who is a the best Muslim)?"" He replied, ""One who avoids harming the Muslims with his tongue and hands."" [3]Jarir b. Abdullah reported Allah's Apostle ﷺ as saying: He who is deprived of tenderly feelings is in fact deprived of good. [4]This is something Prophet Muhammad ﷺ understood and taught, which is likely part of the reason why he was so beloved. He never missed the opportunity to spread love. Don't assume your child knows you're proud of them... take the time to tell them. Don't assume your spouse knows you love them... make it a point to tell them. It is best for us and everyone not to be deprived of feelings of affection and kindness because if you do, you will have stopped goodness and created a void that can be filled with shaitan. The repercussion will also be felt on the day of judgment as we've limited the goodness that's receivable in our accounts.References:[1] Sahih al-Bukhari 6491[2] Sahih Muslim 2593[3] Sahih al-Bukhari 11[4] Sahih Muslim 2592c"
التَّوَابُ,At-Tawwab,The Ever-Pardoning,"The Acceptor of Repentance, The Ever-Relenting, The Acceptor of our Return.","Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is At-Tawwab (in Arabic: ٱلْتَّوَّابُ), The One who beckons for our return. He repeatedly turns mankind towards repentance should they journey temporarily on the wrong path. Allah is lenient and restores grace to those who repent and forgives those who seek forgiveness.","From the root ta-waw-ba (ت و ب), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to return, to return to goodness, to repent, to be restored, to be rewarded for deeds, to be repeatedly summoned or called.","Arabic Root:From the root ta-waw-ba (ت و ب), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to return, to return to goodness, to repent, to be restored, to be rewarded for deeds, to be repeatedly summoned or called.This name of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ, At-Tawwab, means the acceptor of repentance. This name makes an appearance in 11 different verses of the Qur'an. Now, being the acceptor of repentance is the most commonly understood meaning of this name. This is what is meant by seeking Tawbah, i.e., you return to Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ asking for forgiveness. But this misses an important quality of what it means to be At-Taawab. The root of both contains the idea of turning, i.e., changing directions to something else.Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Tawwab not just in the sense that we turn to Him. But for our prayers to be heard and our sins to be forgiven, He must turn to us, allowing for repentance. It is within reason to see how Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ does not need to turn to those who sin. They often willingly engaged in disobedience and defiance, searching for pleasure in worldly pursuits. Why should Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ turn to this servant who knowingly transgresses against Himself? But yet, Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ in His infinite mercy, kindness, and grace, turns to His servant. He listens to his sincere repentance, and He forgives. وَإِذۡ  قَالَ  مُوسَىٰ  لِقَوۡمِهِۦ  يَٰقَوۡمِ  إِنَّكُمۡ  ظَلَمۡتُمۡ  أَنفُسَكُم  بِٱتِّخَاذِكُمُ  ٱلۡعِجۡلَ  فَتُوبُوٓاْ  إِلَىٰ  بَارِئِكُمۡ  فَٱقۡتُلُوٓاْ  أَنفُسَكُمۡ  ذَٰلِكُمۡ  خَيۡرٞ  لَّكُمۡ  عِندَ  بَارِئِكُمۡ  فَتَابَ  عَلَيۡكُمۡۚ  إِنَّهُۥ  هُوَ  ٱلتَّوَّابُ  ٱلرَّحِيمُWa iz qaala Moosaa liqawmihee yaa qawmi innakum zalamtum anfusakum bittikhaa zikumul ‘ijla fatoobooo ilaa Baari'ikum faqtulooo anfusakum zaalikum khairul lakum ‘inda Baari'ikum fataaba ‘alaikum; innahoo Huwat Tawwaabur RaheemYusuf Ali Translation:""And remember Moses said to his people: “O my people! Ye have indeed wronged yourselves by your worship of the calf: So turn (in repentance) to your Maker, and slay yourselves (the wrong-doers); that will be better for you in the sight of your Maker.” Then He turned towards you (in forgiveness): For He is Oft-Returning, Most Merciful."" — (Qur'an 2:54) أَلَمۡ يَعۡلَمُوٓاْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ هُوَ يَقۡبَلُ ٱلتَّوۡبَةَ عَنۡ عِبَادِهِۦ وَيَأۡخُذُ ٱلصَّدَقَٰتِ وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ هُوَ ٱلتَّوَّابُ ٱلرَّحِيمُ,Alam ya'lamooo annal laaha huwa yaqbalut tawbata ‘an ibaadihee wa ya'khuzus sadaqaati wa annal laaha huwat Tawwaabur RaheemEnglish Translation:""Do they not know that it is Allah who accepts repentance from His servants and receives charities and that it is Allah who is the Accepting of repentance, the Merciful?"" — (Qur'an 9:104)The Prophet Muhammad ﷺ describes the lowest people in paradise and how, on the day of judgment, it would be said: ""Present his minor sins to him, and withhold from him his serious sins. Then the minor sins would be placed before him, and it would be said: On such and such a day you did so and so and on such and such a day you did so and so. He would say: Yes. It will not be possible for him to deny, while he would be afraid lest serious sins should be presented before him. It would be said to him: In place of every evil deed you will have a good deed. He will say: ""My Lord! I have done things I do not see here."" I indeed saw the Messenger of Allah laugh till his front teeth were exposed."" [1]From this hadith, we see yet another example of Allah's kindness and generosity. He is oft-pardoning, and we can see how He loves to forgive. ""Those who avoid the major sins and immoralities, only [committing] slight ones. Indeed, your Lord is vast in forgiveness. He was most knowing of you when He produced you from the earth and when you were fetuses in the wombs of your mothers. So do not claim yourselves to be pure; He is most knowing of who fears Him"" (Qur'an 52:32). Here, it's important to realize that the goal is not to reach perfection, ""do not claim yourselves to be pure."" This has been interpreted to be understood that Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ expects us to slip and fall, for the minor sins He forgives without even being asked for ""He is most knowing of you,"" and He's ""vast in forgiveness."" The other view is that we should not be proud of piety; the ability to do good is because Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ has purified them to be able to do good. It is from Him, and we should be grateful to Him for this ability. There's a difference of opinion regarding ""the major sins,"" for these sins can be forgiven but require active repentance, ""...do not despair of the mercy of Allah. Indeed, Allah forgives all sins. Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiving, the Merciful."" (Qur'an 39:53).Guilt is an interesting emotion and can be seen as a gift from Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. It can go two ways, (1) destructive and (2) instructive. If we are not careful, the constant repetition of something we know is inherently not good for us or is immoral will cause guilt to fester. It's like a built-in alarm siren that's shouting to change course. If it's ignored, it can erode self-confidence, self-esteem, and overall self-worth. If the action which originally caused guilt becomes normalized, then we may fail to recognize the damage it's causing. The one who sins and no longer fears Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ should be most worried. This person may have developed a deep-rooted belief that they will not have to answer to anyone as they face no serious repercussions for their misdeeds.In their case, it would be best to read the Qur'an and learn about the warnings and punishment of the afterlife to re-instill this fear. He is merciful and turns to His servant, He gives us the chance to meet Him halfway, but remember Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is also just. Being able to admit your faults and harbor guilt is a beautiful sign of your belief and dedication to Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. It is a sign of your iman (faith). Don't let guilt transform into self-hate, don't ever think it's too late for you. At any given moment, you can change. The next nine years don't have to look like the previous nine. ""Allah wants to accept your repentance"" (Qur'an 4:27). It is never too late to seek the forgiveness of your Lord.Anas bin Malik narrated that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: “Allah, Blessed is He and Most High, said: ‘O son of Adam! Verily as long as you called upon Me and hoped in Me, I forgave you, despite whatever may have occurred from you, and I did not mind. O son of Adam! Were your sins to reach the clouds of the sky, then you sought forgiveness from Me, I would forgive you, and I would not mind. So son of Adam! If you came to me with sins nearly as great as the earth, and then you met Me not associating anything with Me, I would come to you with forgiveness nearly as great as it.'” [2] فَتَلَقَّىٰٓ  ءَادَمُ  مِن  رَّبِّهِۦ  كَلِمَٰتٖ  فَتَابَ  عَلَيۡهِۚ  إِنَّهُۥ  هُوَ  ٱلتَّوَّابُ  ٱلرَّحِيمُFatalaqqaaa Aadamu mir Rabbihee Kalimaatin fataaba ‘alaihi; innahoo Huwat Tawwaabur RaheemEnglish Translation:""Then Adam received from his Lord [some] words, and He accepted his repentance. Indeed, it is He who is the Accepting of repentance, the Merciful."" — (Qur'an 2:37) إِلَّا  ٱلَّذِينَ  تَابُواْ  وَأَصۡلَحُواْ  وَبَيَّنُواْ  فَأُوْلَـٰٓئِكَ  أَتُوبُ  عَلَيۡهِمۡ  وَأَنَا  ٱلتَّوَّابُ  ٱلرَّحِيمُIllal lazeena taaboo wa aslahoo wa baiyanoo fa ulaaa'ika atoobu ‘alaihim; wa Anat Tawwaabur RaheemEnglish Translation:""Except for those who repent and correct themselves and make evident [what they concealed]. Those - I will accept their repentance, and I am the Accepting of repentance, the Merciful."" — (Qur'an 2:160)We may see someone we know messing up, and their world may come crashing down on them. Some will abandon their side because they disagree with their ways, so they try to create distance between them and that person. Now, each person's case is unique, and we're not advocating for people to sympathize with abusers or put up with harmful or toxic relationships. But if you care for that person as a friend, we should try (in whatever way they allow it) to be part of the recovery process. To be part of the core support group to try and help build back better.Imam al-Ghazali writes in connection to this name, ""whoever accepts time and again the excuses of those who do wrong among those entrusted to his care, as well as those of his friends and acquaintances, is indeed characterized by this quality and has gained a share of it."" Narrated Anas: Allah's Messenger ﷺ said, ""Help your brother, whether he is an oppressor or he is an oppressed one. People asked, ""O Allah's Messenger ﷺ! It is all right to help him if he is oppressed, but how should we help him if he is an oppressor?"" The Prophet ﷺ said, ""By preventing him from oppressing others."" [3]We live in a time where we are fast to point fingers. Where people are not allowed to make mistakes publicly, but if we wish to share the connection in this divine name of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ as being At-Tawwab, we should turn to people in kindness just as we want Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ to be kind to us, even when we are in the wrong. It was narrated from Anas bin Malik that: The Prophet ﷺ said: ""None of you has believed until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself."" [4] When we study the beautiful names of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ we learn of the ways in which He describes Himself and makes Himself known to us. Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ tells us He is kind, generous, merciful, wise, forgiving, oft-pardoning, and a friend to all. This should make us laugh and smile just as Prophet Muhammad ﷺ did when teaching others the mercy of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ.References:[1] Sahih Muslim 190a[2] Hasan (Darussalam) Jami` at-Tirmidhi 3540[3] Sahih al-Bukhari 2444[4] Sahih (Darussalam) Sunan an-Nasa'i 5039"
الْمُنْتَقِمُ,Al-Muntaqim,The Avenger,"The Disapprover, The Inflictor of Retribution, The Retaliator.","Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Muntaqim (in Arabic: ٱلْمُنْتَقِمُ), The One who victoriously prevails over His enemies and punishes them for their sins. Allah is most patient, but the time will come when justice must be given. Avoid things which Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ has forbidden, for He is swift and just with His punishment and does not let trespassing go unaccounted for.","From the root nun-qaf-mim (ن ق م), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to dislike, disapprove, find fault, to punish, exact vengeance, to inflict retribution, avenge.","Arabic Root:From the root nun-qaf-mim (ن ق م), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to dislike, disapprove, find fault, to punish, exact vengeance, to inflict retribution, avenge.From The Story of Prophet Nuh (as):The story of Prophet Nuh (as) is very illustrative of this name. We briefly mentioned how Prophet Nuh (as) preached for 950 years, ""And We certainly sent Noah to his people, and he remained among them a thousand years minus fifty years, and the flood seized them while they were wrongdoers"" (Qur'an 29:14) The people denied His message, which was one thing, but that rejection turned into harassment, and they slowly grew hostile towards him. The Qur'an even mentions possible death threats Nuh (as) had to endure, ""They said, 'If you do not desist, O Noah, you will surely be of those who are stoned.'"" (Qur'an 26:116) and also, ""The people of Noah denied before them, and they denied Our servant and said, 'A madman,' and he was repelled."" (Qur'an 54:9). Some Qur'an interpreters mention that stoning may not be literal but refer to constant abuse, slander, or vilification from all sides. This is the view of early Qur'an exegetes with regards to the phrase ""al-shaytan al-rajim"" as literally meaning ""the stoned shaitan"" but now more commonly as ""the accursed satan."" This symbolizes a metaphorical stoning rather than a literal one. Regardless, after centuries of calling people to embrace Islam but it falling on deaf ears and patiently enduring the abuse, Nuh (as) cried out to his Lord with this supplication رَّبِّ ٱغۡفِرۡ لِي وَلِوَٰلِدَيَّ وَلِمَن دَخَلَ بَيۡتِيَ مُؤۡمِنٗا وَلِلۡمُؤۡمِنِينَ وَٱلۡمُؤۡمِنَٰتِۖ وَلَا تَزِدِ ٱلظَّـٰلِمِينَ إِلَّا تَبَارَۢاRabbigh fir lee wa liwaa lidaiya wa liman dakhala baitiya mu'minanw wa lil mu'mineena wal mu'minaati wa laa tazidiz zaalimeena illaa tabaaraaEnglish Translation:""My Lord, forgive me and my parents and whoever enters my house a believer and the believing men and believing women. And do not increase the wrongdoers except in destruction."" — (Qur'an 71:28)In Surah al-Qamar we also learn of the exact du'a Nuh (as) made before the flood: فَدَعَا رَبَّهُۥٓ أَنِّي مَغۡلُوبٞ فَٱنتَصِرۡFada'aa Rabbahooo annee maghloobun fantasirEnglish Translation:""So he invoked his Lord, 'Indeed, I am overpowered, so help.'"" — (Qur'an 54:10)And so what proceeded was retributive justice, ""Then We opened the gates of the heaven with rain pouring down"" (Qur'an 54:11). The same fate is mentioned of Firawn, ""So We took retribution from them, and We drowned them in the sea because they denied Our signs and were heedless of them."" (Qur'an 7:136). In every example, you will find that Allah's punishment is not without cause. He is the impartial judge (Al-Hakam. He gives repeated signs of His mercy and allows for the perpetrator to return back to Him (the virtue of also being At-Tawwab). If they decide to remain defiant, defensive, and thankless, then inevitably, they will pay the price.From the story of Nuh (as), we also learn that his son was among those who drowned. He refused to accept Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ and even on the day when the storm came, he told his father he rather goes to the top of the hill than with him on the boat. ""[But] he said, 'I will take refuge on a mountain to protect me from the water.' [Noah] said, 'There is no protector today from the decree of Allah, except for whom He gives mercy.' And the waves came between them, and he was among the drowned."" (Qur'an 11:34)This is a hard but an important lesson. Despite the Prophets (may peace be upon them) being favored by Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ to spread His message, there is no favoritism. Every person will be held accountable for their actions. It does not matter what lineage or bloodline a person comes from. These things may matter in the realm of human politicking, but in receiving Allah's mercy or punishment, it holds no precedence. Every person will be held responsible for what they earn. فَإِمَّا نَذۡهَبَنَّ بِكَ فَإِنَّا مِنۡهُم مُّنتَقِمُونَFa immaa nazhabanna bika fa innaa minhum muntaqimoonEnglish Translation:""And whether [or not] We take you away [in death], indeed, We will take retribution upon them."" — (Qur'an 43:41) يَوۡمَ نَبۡطِشُ ٱلۡبَطۡشَةَ ٱلۡكُبۡرَىٰٓ إِنَّا مُنتَقِمُونَYawma nabtishul batsha tal kubraa innaa muntaqimoonEnglish Translation:""The Day We will strike with the greatest assault, indeed, We will take retribution."" — (Qur'an 44:16) مِن قَبۡلُ هُدٗى لِّلنَّاسِ وَأَنزَلَ ٱلۡفُرۡقَانَۗ إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ بِـَٔايَٰتِ ٱللَّهِ لَهُمۡ عَذَابٞ شَدِيدٞۗ وَٱللَّهُ عَزِيزٞ ذُو ٱنتِقَامٍMin qablu hudal linnaasi wa anzalal Furqaan; innallazeena kafaroo bi Aayaatil laahi lahum ‘azaabun shadeed; wallaahu azeezun zun tiqaamEnglish Translation:""Before, as guidance for the people. And He revealed the Qur'an. Indeed, those who disbelieve in the verses of Allah will have a severe punishment, and Allah is exalted in Might, the Owner of Retribution."" — (Qur'an 3:4)Reflection:This name is important to understand for several reasons. The first is to instill fear. This can remind those in power that they are still accountable to Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. He punishes those who cause disharmony, oppress, and tyrannizes His creation.It teaches us at the individual level that we will be held accountable for whatever good or bad we do. It provides assurance and peace to victims of abuse that their perpetrator will face the most just of judges. He has complete knowledge and knows the appropriate action to handle each situation.In Imam al-Ghazali's book, he writes the best vengeance is on the enemies of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ, but the worst of all the enemies is one's lower soul. ""As it is reported regarding Abu Yazīd - may God be merciful to him that he said: 'My soul was so lazy one night as to keep me from a litany, so I punished it by depriving it of water for a year."" So take vengeance against oneself in matters where one lets down. In failing to be obedient in worship, in giving, in showing kindness, in repressing anger, in controlling one's tongue. Each person has their own struggle, and in this way, they should pursue the path of vengeance."
العَفُوُ,Al-'Afuww,The Pardoner,"The Oft-Pardoning, The Effacer of Sins, The Eliminator of Sins.","Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Afuw (in Arabic: ٱلْعَفُوُّ), The One who pardons sins and leaves no trace of any fault. The difference between forgiving and effacing is there will be no trace or record of the offense being committed. It will be as if it had never happened.","From the root ayn-fa-waw (ع ف و), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to forgive, pardon, to pass over, forgo, absolve, to obliterate all traces, efface, remove, to kill-off, allow to die, to turn away from punishing, not see, annul, to make unapparent, imperceptible, to give spontaneously, to give without constraint, to give more than what is due.","Arabic Root:From the root ayn-fa-waw (ع ف و), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to forgive, pardon, to pass over, forgo, absolve, to obliterate all traces, efface, remove, to kill-off, allow to die, to turn away from punishing, not see, annul, to make unapparent, imperceptible, to give spontaneously, to give without constraint, to give more than what is due.This name compared to other names of forgiveness:Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ loves to forgive His servants. We can see from the previous attributes that much has been said about His forgiveness. He is At-Tawwab (The Ever-Relenting), Ar-Rahman (The Beneficent), Ar-Raheem (The Merciful), Al-Ghaffar (The Forgiver), and Al-Gafoor (The Great Forgiver). Now, we expand to this list by adding another name, Al-Afuw, The Effacer of Sins. He is the one who erases all traces of sin. Forgiveness implies concealment, but the mark of sin still exists on the servant's record. Al-Afuww suggests much more than just forgiving but eliminating it entirely. The view of scholars is the prior names are names of maghfirah (seeking forgiveness) which is different from seeking afw. For example, maghfirah is like forgiving but not forgetting. ‘afw is purification, being reborn, and having a clean slate. As a name of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ, Al-Afuw is mentioned for a total of five times in the Qur'an. إِن تُبۡدُواْ خَيۡرًا أَوۡ تُخۡفُوهُ أَوۡ تَعۡفُواْ عَن سُوٓءٖ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ عَفُوّٗا قَدِيرًاin tubdoo khairann aw tukhfoohu aw ta'foo ‘an sooo'in fa innal laaha kaana ‘afuwwan QadeeraaABUL ALA MAUDUDI TRANSLATION:""(Even though you have the right to speak evil if you are wronged), if you keep doing good -whether openly or secretly -or at least pardon the evil (then that is the attribute of Allah). Allah is All-Pardoning and He has all the power to chastise."" — (Qur'an 4:149) ۞ذَٰلِكَۖ وَمَنۡ عَاقَبَ بِمِثۡلِ مَا عُوقِبَ بِهِۦ ثُمَّ بُغِيَ عَلَيۡهِ لَيَنصُرَنَّهُ ٱللَّهُۚ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَعَفُوٌّ غَفُورٞZaalika wa man ‘aaqaba bimisli maa ‘ooqiba bihee summa bughiya ‘alaihi la yansurannahul laah; innal laaha la ‘Afuwwun GhafoorEnglish Translation:""That [is so]. And whoever responds [to injustice] with the equivalent of that with which he was harmed and then is tyrannized - Allah will surely aid him. Indeed, Allah is Pardoning and Forgiving."" — (Qur'an 22:60)Signs of Allah's mercy:Once equipped with the knowledge of these attributes, how can someone feel as if they are so reprehensible that they are beyond Allah's mercy when all evidence points to a Lord who shows us He is caring, kind, and loves to forgive? So, we should never feel overwhelmed. We are told in the Qur'an that doubting Allah's mercy is a greater sin than the thing you were worried about in the first place, ""O my sons, go and find out about Joseph and his brother and despair not of relief from Allah. Indeed, no one despairs of relief from Allah except the disbelieving people."" (Qur'an 12:87) Never give up hope in Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ, and never stop trusting in Him for what you're trying to accomplish. Instead, we should focus on what is within our control, and that is seeking His forgiveness and moving toward spreading as much good as we can. The rest is with Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ.The mercy of Ramadan:One of the signs of His mercy is giving us the month of Ramadan. A chance for us to return to Him and receive His blessings Narrated Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger ﷺ as saying: When there comes the month of Ramadan, the gates of mercy are opened, and the gates of Hell are locked and the devils are chained. [1]Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet ﷺ said, ""Whoever established prayers on the night of Qadr out of sincere faith and hoping for a reward from Allah, then all his previous sins will be forgiven; and whoever fasts in the month of Ramadan out of sincere faith, and hoping for a reward from Allah, then all his previous sins will be forgiven."" [2]In this month, Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ revealed the first verse of the Qur'an establishing the night of decree (laylatul qadr). This is a night said to have more blessings than a thousand months, ""Indeed, We sent the Qur'an down during the Night of Decree. And what can make you know what is the Night of Decree? The Night of Decree is better than a thousand months. The angels and the Spirit descend therein by permission of their Lord for every matter. Peace it is until the emergence of dawn."" (Qur'an 97:1-5)It was narrated from Aishah that she said: ""O Messenger of Allah ﷺ, what do you think I should say in my supplication, if I come upon Laylatul-Qadr?"" He ﷺ said: [3]اللَّهُمَّ إِنَّكَ  عَفُوٌّ تُحِبُّ الْعَفْوَ فَاعْفُ عَنِّيAllahumma innaka afuwwun tuhibbul-afwa, fa'fu anniEnglish Translation:""O Allah, You are Forgiving and love forgiveness, so forgive me"" When to seek Allah's forgiveness:It's also worth noting that seeking the forgiveness of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ should not be confined to only when we have knowingly sinned. We know from the sunnah of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ that he engaged in istighfar (seeking forgiveness) over seventy times a day. Narrated by Abu Huraira: I heard Allah's Messenger ﷺ saying."" By Allah! I ask for forgiveness from Allah and turn to Him in repentance more than seventy times a day."" [4] In some other narrations this number is reported to be as high as one-hundred times a day. [5] Now, keep in mind this is a man beloved and protected by Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ who still feared not receiving the grace of His Lord. Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger ﷺ as saying: None amongst you can get into Paradise by virtue of his deeds alone. They said: Allah's Messenger, not even you? Thereupon he said: Not even I, but that Allah should wrap me in His Grace and Mercy.[6]This, however, should not deter us from doing good deeds. In the Qur'an, it mentions how if a person does good, some of his misdeeds will be converted to good, ""Except for those who repent, believe and do righteous work. For them Allah will replace their evil deeds with good. And ever is Allah Forgiving and Merciful."" (Qur'an 25:70)References:[1] Sahih Muslim 1079a[2] Sahih al-Bukhari 1901[3] Sahih (Darussalam) Sunan Ibn Majah 3850[4] Sahih al-Bukhari 6307[5] Sahih Muslim 2702b [6] Sahih Muslim 2702b "
الرَّؤُوفُ,Ar-Ra'uf,The Most Kind,"The All-Pitying, The Compassionate, The Clement.","Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Ar-Ra'uf (in Arabic: ٱلْرَّؤُفُ), The One who is extremely compassionate. He is The One whose mercy will endow whoever he willed among His creatures. Whatever Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ decrees is done with perfect judgment, and He is never harsh or unjust in his rulings.","From the root ra-hamza-fa (ر أ ف), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be kind, gentle, clement, to be merciful, compassionate, to show pity, to show tenderness.","Arabic Root:From the root ra-hamza-fa (ر أ ف), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be kind, gentle, clement, to be merciful, compassionate, to show pity, to show tenderness.Difference between Raheem and Ra'uf:The name of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ Ar-Rauf, the most kind and compassionate, is mentioned 11 times in the Qur'an. Calling on this name invokes on Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ desire to be tender to His servants. In fact, in the Qur'an, this name is often mentioned in pairs with the names of His mercy. Imam Al-Ghazali writes, ""Al-Ra'uf - the All-Pitying - is one who possess pity, and pity is an intensification of mercy.""So in a sense, it's similar to the name Ar-Raheem (The Merciful) but exists as a more intensified or emphatic form. The difference is Allah's Rahma (mercy) is shown after a calamity, whereas Ra'fa is before. Narrated Abdullah: I visited the Prophet ﷺ during his ailments, and he was suffering from a high fever. I said, ""You have a high fever. Is it because you will have a double reward for it?"" He said, ""Yes, for no Muslim is afflicted with any harm but that Allah will remove his sins as the leaves of a tree fall down."" [1]Here tragedy befalls a person, and he/she has been afflicted with some hardship. But this is not without benefit, Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ shows His mercy to that person, and this is atonement from sins. Allah's Messenger ﷺ said: There is no trouble that comes to a believer except that it obliterates from his sins, even if it is the pricking of a thorn. [2]These two are examples of Rahma or Allah's mercy. Ra'fa manifests in ways of warnings or protection from things that may cause a person harm. He takes pity and showers His mercy so tragedy can be avoided. To receive Allah's compassion means enjoining good here on earth but also for you in the hereafter. This is a higher form of mercy, by giving His servants warnings of actions that will cause damage. We may not be privy to this kind of compassion which is why Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is always deserving of more than we can offer. In the book, ""In the Company of God,"" it mentions the scholar Abu Ubaydah who said: ""Compassion is more delicate a disposition than mercy."" وَٱلَّذِينَ جَآءُو مِنۢ بَعۡدِهِمۡ يَقُولُونَ رَبَّنَا ٱغۡفِرۡ لَنَا وَلِإِخۡوَٰنِنَا ٱلَّذِينَ سَبَقُونَا بِٱلۡإِيمَٰنِ وَلَا تَجۡعَلۡ فِي قُلُوبِنَا غِلّٗا لِّلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ رَبَّنَآ إِنَّكَ رَءُوفٞ رَّحِيمٌWallazeena jaaa'oo min ba'dihim yaqooloona Rabbanagh fir lanaa wa li ikhwaani nal lazeena sabqoonaa bil eemaani wa laa taj'al fee quloobinaa ghillalil lazeena aamanoo rabbannaaa innaka Ra'oofur RaheemEnglish Translation:""And [there is a share for] those who came after them, saying, 'Our Lord, forgive us and our brothers who preceded us in faith and put not in our hearts [any] resentment toward those who have believed.

The study of His attributes of mercy and compassion increases our love towards Him as it shows He cares and loves us. We are not left stranded and hopeless. This name communicates a yearning of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ to be empathetic to our struggle and show pity to one who returns to Him. He guides and instructs us in ways that are unseen and saves us from harm, and to Him, we are forever grateful.References:[1] Sahih al-Bukhari 5647[2] Sahih Muslim 2572e"
َمَالِكُ ٱلْمُلْكُ,Malik ul-Mulk,Master of the Kingdom,"The Owner of Absolute Sovereignty, The Owner of Dominion.","Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Malikul-Mulk (in Arabic: مَالِكُ ٱلْمُلْكُ), The Lord of the Kingdom. He is the sole owner of all creation and, with absolute authority, can act in any manner, at any time, and in any way.","From the root mim-lam-kaf (م ل ك), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to possess, to own exclusively, to exercise authority, to command to have power over, command, reign to have dominion over, to have ruling power to have kingship.","Arabic Root:From the root mim-lam-kaf (م ل ك), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to possess, to own exclusively, to exercise authority, to command to have power over, command, reign to have dominion over, to have ruling power to have kingship.This is similar to a previous name of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ we've discussed, Al-Malik (The Owner). As mentioned, there is a difference between Malik (king) and Mālik (owner). Al-Mulk refers to His dominion, territory, or kingdom. So together, Malik Al-Mulk or Mālik Al-Mulk means The King of Absolute Sovereignty, The Owner of Absolute Sovereignty. No one possesses perfect power but Him. He carries out whatever He wants in a manner which pleases Him, and nothing can come in the way of His decree. All of creation comes from Him, and He remains with absolute control over them, not suffering from any limitations. If He so wished to bring about its complete destruction or annihilation, He could. Now, imagine Him by your side, supporting you in your cause, ""If Allah should aid you, no one can overcome you; but if He should forsake you, who is there that can aid you after Him? And upon Allah let the believers rely."" (Qur'an 3:160) قُلِ ٱللَّهُمَّ مَٰلِكَ ٱلۡمُلۡكِ تُؤۡتِي ٱلۡمُلۡكَ مَن تَشَآءُ وَتَنزِعُ ٱلۡمُلۡكَ مِمَّن تَشَآءُ وَتُعِزُّ مَن تَشَآءُ وَتُذِلُّ مَن تَشَآءُۖ بِيَدِكَ ٱلۡخَيۡرُۖ إِنَّكَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيۡءٖ قَدِيرٞQulil laahumma Maalikal Mulki tu'til mulka man tashaaa'u wa tanzi'ul mulka mimman tashhaaa'u wa tu'izzu man tashaaa'u wa tuzillu man tashaaa'u biyadikal khairu innaka ‘alaa kulli shai'in QadeerEnglish Translation:""Say, “O Allah, Owner of Sovereignty, You give sovereignty to whom You will and You take sovereignty away from whom You will. You honor whom You will and You humble whom You will. In Your hand is [all] good. Indeed, You are over all things competent."" — (Qur'an 3:26) وَلِلَّهِ مُلۡكُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلۡأَرۡضِۖ وَإِلَى ٱللَّهِ ٱلۡمَصِيرُWa lillaahi mulkus samaawaati wal ardi wa ilal laahil maseerEnglish Translation:""And to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and to Allah is the destination."" — (Qur'an 24:42)In our daily prayers and the opening chapter of the Qur'an, we are reminded that He is the ""master"" or ""owner"" of the day of judgment. This reminds us that He alone possesses power and gives His final verdict. مَٰلِكِ يَوۡمِ ٱلدِّينِMaaliki Yawmid-DeenEnglish Translation:""Sovereign of the Day of Recompense."" — (Qur'an 1:4)This name reminds us of the temporary nature of our existence on earth. Part of living is our desire to expand endlessly, acquiring things. In this acquisition of land, property, and material, we become deluded. It is easy to become distracted and believe all of this is real and that the goal of living is to consume and conquer. Our ego inflates if we see success, and we are prone to become less akhirah motivated. This is why receiving wealth is a blessing from Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ but also a test in disguise. Will they use their wealth in a manner pleasing to Him, or will they become a servant to their ego?Take a second to reflect on this hypothetical scenario, and try to really see yourself in this scenario. You just bought your first home and looking at this beautiful structure, envision all the future memories that'll reside within. What feelings flood your heart and brain? Now, many years have passed. Alhamdulillah, you're doing well financially and closed on your second, third, and looking for a fourth investment properties. What feelings come to you as you stand there looking at each of your properties. In your mind, does the inner dialogue say, ""wow, I can't believe this is mine!"" It's not far-fetched you'd feel this way, but this is where the danger creeps in. The development of this self-image, being ""the owner"" of these properties and land. A sense of great pride and honor envelopes your psyche. The scariest part is you may not even realize it. But how many people stood on this same land before you? How many people before you held a written document proclaiming the ownership of the very land you currently stand on? All were deluded by this temporary ownership. This failure is partly due to the omission and deep resonation with the saying of alhamdulillah (all praise is due to Allah). Allah gives some of His servant's temporary ownership, but He is the eternal owner.This tiny thought experiment is on such a small scale, but still, we see the nature of the human condition. A few are given the position of extreme wealth, like Firawn or Nimrod. The power which they likely craved was given to them by Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ, and it had corrupted them. They began to feel like untouchable kings with no authority to prevail over them. In Surah Baqarah, it mentions how the tyrant King Nimrod believed he had absolute sovereignty over his land and people. His word became the law of the land. If he was so inclined to kill a man, he could go without recourse. أَلَمۡ  تَرَ  إِلَى  ٱلَّذِي  حَآجَّ  إِبۡرَٰهِـۧمَ  فِي  رَبِّهِۦٓ  أَنۡ  ءَاتَىٰهُ  ٱللَّهُ  ٱلۡمُلۡكَ  إِذۡ  قَالَ  إِبۡرَٰهِـۧمُ  رَبِّيَ  ٱلَّذِي  يُحۡيِۦ  وَيُمِيتُ  قَالَ  أَنَا۠  أُحۡيِۦ  وَأُمِيتُۖ  قَالَ  إِبۡرَٰهِـۧمُ  فَإِنَّ  ٱللَّهَ  يَأۡتِي  بِٱلشَّمۡسِ  مِنَ  ٱلۡمَشۡرِقِ  فَأۡتِ  بِهَا  مِنَ  ٱلۡمَغۡرِبِ  فَبُهِتَ  ٱلَّذِي  كَفَرَۗ  وَٱللَّهُ  لَا  يَهۡدِي  ٱلۡقَوۡمَ  ٱلظَّـٰلِمِينَAlam tara ilal lazee Haaajja Ibraaheema fee Rabbiheee an aataahullaahul mulka iz qaala Ibraaheemu Rabbiyal lazee yuhyee wa yumeetu qaala ana uhyee wa umeetu qaala Ibraaheemu fa innal laaha yaatee bishshamsi minal mashriqi faati bihaa minal maghribi fabuhital lazee kafar; wallaahu laa yahdil qawmaz zaalimeenEnglish Translation:""Have you not considered the one who argued with Abraham about his Lord [merely] because Allah had given him kingship? When Abraham said, “My Lord is the one who gives life and causes death,” he said, “I give life and cause death.” Abraham said, “Indeed, Allah brings up the sun from the east, so bring it up from the west.” So the disbeliever was overwhelmed [by astonishment], and Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people."" — (Qur'an 2:258)Prophet Ibrahim (as) then challenges Him to control the sun's setting. The Tafseer of Abul Ala Maududi mentions how Nimrod did not deny the existence of God or believe He was the creator of heaven and earth. So this statement was meant to remind him of a greater authority that rules over whatever dominion he thinks he has.In comparison, Prophet Sulaiman (as) was a wise and noble king. He was blessed by Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ, and we can see the difference in leadership and mindset from this one du'a he made. فَتَبَسَّمَ ضَاحِكٗا مِّن قَوۡلِهَا وَقَالَ رَبِّ أَوۡزِعۡنِيٓ أَنۡ أَشۡكُرَ نِعۡمَتَكَ ٱلَّتِيٓ أَنۡعَمۡتَ عَلَيَّ وَعَلَىٰ وَٰلِدَيَّ وَأَنۡ أَعۡمَلَ صَٰلِحٗا تَرۡضَىٰهُ وَأَدۡخِلۡنِي بِرَحۡمَتِكَ فِي عِبَادِكَ ٱلصَّـٰلِحِينَFatabassama daahikam min qawlihaa wa qaala Rabbi awzi'nee an ashkura ni'mata kal lateee an'amta ‘alaiya wa ‘alaa waalidaiya wa an a'mala saalihan tardaahu wa adkhilnee birahmatika fee ‘ibaadikas saaliheenEnglish Translation:""So [Solomon] smiled, amused at her speech, and said, 'My Lord, enable me to be grateful for Your favor which You have bestowed upon me and upon my parents and to do righteousness of which You approve. And admit me by Your mercy into [the ranks of] Your righteous servants.'"" — (Qur'an 27:19)He is well aware of what troubles arise from getting what you want. You can become arrogant, ungrateful, and prideful. So in his du'a, he asks Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ to ""enable me to be grateful for Your favor"" and ""do righteousness of which You approve."" His leadership was rooted in His submission and gratitude to Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. His mission was driven to be of service to His Lord, who He knows is the true king.Again, we see the central theme around humility. The moment you begin to think you're greater than you are, you've collapsed whatever blessings Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ has given you. Abu Huraira reported from Allah's Messenger ﷺ as saying:  The most wretched person in the sight of Allah on the Day of Resurrection and the worst person and target of His wrath would of the person who is called Malik al-Amlak (the King of Kings) for there is no king but Allah. [1]This next hadith is very instructive in understanding Allah's power and dominion. Abu Dharr reported Allah's Messenger ﷺ as saying that Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, said: [2]""O My servants, I have forbidden oppression for Myself and have made it forbidden amongst you, so do not oppress one another. O My servants, all of you are astray except for those I have guided, so seek guidance of Me and I shall guide you, O My servants, all of you are hungry except for those I have fed, so seek food of Me and I shall feed you. O My servants, all of you are naked except for those I have clothed, so seek clothing of Me and I shall clothe you. O My servants, you sin by night and by day, and I forgive all sins, so seek forgiveness of Me and I shall forgive you. O My servants, you will not attain harming Me so as to harm Me, and will not attain benefitting Me so as to benefit Me. O My servants, were the first of you and the last of you, the human of you and the jinn of you to be as pious as the most pious heart of any one man of you, that would not increase My dominion in anything. O My servants, were the first of you and the last of you, the human of you and the jinn of you to be as wicked as the most wicked heart of any one man of you, that would not decrease My dominion in anything. O My servants, were the first of you and the last of you, the human of you and the jinn of you to rise up in one place and make a request of Me, and were I to give everyone what he requested, that would not decrease what I have, any more that a needle decreases the sea if put into it. O My servants, it is but your deeds that I record for you and then recompense you for. So let him who finds good, praise Allah, and let him who finds other than that blame no one but himself.""References:[1] Sahih Muslim 2143b[2] Sahih Muslim 2577a"
ذُوالْجَلاَلِ وَالإكْرَامِ,Zul Jalali Wal Ikram / Dhul Jalali Wal Ikram,Possessor of Glory and Honor,"Lord of Majesty and Bounty, Possessor of Might and Glory.","Allah is Zul-Jalaali-wal-Ikram (in Arabic: ذُو ٱلْجَلَالِ وَٱلْإِكْرَامُ), The One who is glorious and majestic. He is the possessor of all glory and honor. He is The One who deserves to be Exalted and not denied.","The attributes of Allah in this phrase are based on the root of two jim-lam-lam (ج ل ل) and kaf-ra-mim (ك ر م). The meaning of j-l-l: to be supremely great to be glorious, majestic to be sublime to be high, lofty, far above, independent. k-r-m: to be noble, high minded, generous, to be highly esteemed, honored, prized, valued, to be excellent, precious, valuable, rare, to be productive, fruitful, bountiful.","Arabic Root:The attributes of Allah in this phrase are based on the root of two jim-lam-lam (ج ل ل) and kaf-ra-mim (ك ر م). The meaning of j-l-l: to be supremely great to be glorious, majestic to be sublime to be high, lofty, far above, independent. k-r-m: to be noble, high minded, generous, to be highly esteemed, honored, prized, valued, to be excellent, precious, valuable, rare, to be productive, fruitful, bountiful.You may find various translations of this name, and it stems from the interpretations of what Jalal and Ikram mean. Dhul (The Lord or Possessor), Jalal (Majesty or Glory), wal (and), Ikram, which comes from Karam (Generosity or Honor - similar to the name Al-Kareem). So, together we often see the Lord of Majesty and Honor, The Lord of Bounty and Honor, Lord of Majesty and Generosity. As a name of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ it is mentioned twice in the Qur'an, both times in Surah Ar-Rahman. وَيَبۡقَىٰ وَجۡهُ رَبِّكَ ذُو ٱلۡجَلَٰلِ وَٱلۡإِكۡرَامِWa yabqaa wajhu rabbika zul jalaali wal ikraamEnglish Translation:""And there will remain the Face of your Lord, Owner of Majesty and Honor."" — (Qur'an 55:27) تَبَٰرَكَ ٱسۡمُ رَبِّكَ ذِي ٱلۡجَلَٰلِ وَٱلۡإِكۡرَامِTabaarakasmu Rabbika Zil-Jalaali wal-IkraamEnglish Translation:""Blessed is the name of your Lord, Owner of Majesty and Honor."" — (Qur'an 55:78)The Face of Allah:In Surah Ar-Rahman, leading up to ayah 27, the primary focus was on the blessings of the worldly life. From 26-27, it marks the transition to the blessings of the afterlife, ""Everyone upon the earth will perish, And there will remain the Face of your Lord, Owner of Majesty and Honor."" Imam Bayhaqi mentions, ""As for Allah's face, we affirm it is an attribute of Allah, not as a form or image."" Rather wajh is often interpreted as a ""face"" to represent His essence of having attributes of majesty and honor.What has also been said is the order of these two qualities. We must first recognize His Majesty, which encompasses many of His attributes, power, strength, judgment, knowledge, and absolute dominion. This could be classified as first studying and developing Taqwa (often described as God-consciousness or God-fearing piety), then we should study His grace (attributes of kindness, mercy, and forgiveness).Reflection:If we only realize His loving and merciful attributes, we may rationalize or be easily tempted by bad behaviors. But if we recognize His power and strength, we would avoid things out of fear of displeasing Him. This is a back-and-forth between reverence and seeking repentance from His attributes of love and mercy. It was reported that Umar bin Khattab asked Ubayy ibn Ka'b about Taqwa. Ubay said, ""Have you ever walked on a path that has thorns on it?"" Umar said, ""Yes."" Ubayy asked, ""What did you do then?"" to which Umar replied, ""I rolled up my sleeves and struggled."" Ubayy said, ""That is taqwa, to protect oneself from sin through life's dangerous journey so that one can successfully complete the journey unscathed by sin."" [1]A'isha (ra) reported: When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ pronounced salutation, he salutation longer than it took him to say: [2]اللَّهُمَّ أَنْتَ السَّلاَمُ وَمِنْكَ السَّلاَمُ تَبَارَكْتَ ذَا الْجَلاَلِ وَالإِكْرَامِAllahumma antas salam wa minkas salam tabarakta dhal jalali wal ikramEnglish Translation:""O Allah: Thou art Peace, and peace comes from Thee, blessed art Thou, Possessor of Glory and Honour""Narrated Anas ibn Malik: I was sitting with the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and a man was offering prayer. He then made supplication: [3] اللَّهُمَّ إِنِّي أَسْأَلُكَ بِأَنَّ لَكَ الْحَمْدَ لاَ إِلَهَ إِلاَّ أَنْتَ الْمَنَّانُ بَدِيعُ السَّمَوَاتِ وَالأَرْضِ يَا ذَا الْجَلاَلِ وَالإِكْرَامِ يَا حَىُّ يَا قَيُّومُAllahumma inni as'aluka bi - anna lakal - hamd, lailaha illa ant, al - mannanu badi'us - samawati wal - ard, ya dhal jalali wal ikram!

The narration continues, ""The Prophet ﷺ then said: He has supplicated Allah using His Greatest Name, when supplicated by this name, He answers, and when asked by this name He gives.""References:[1] Muhammad Saed Abdul-Rahman (2009).

الْمُقْسِطُ,Al-Muqsit,The Just One,"The Equitable, The Requiter, The Redresser.","Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Muqsit (in Arabic: ٱلْمُقْسِطُ), The One who is most fair and just. He recognizes and provides rewards beyond measure for any good, however small.

He is the one who perfectly balances the punishment with the crime. He brings satisfaction to the victim while holding the perpetrator accountable in equal measure.  وَنَضَعُ ٱلۡمَوَٰزِينَ ٱلۡقِسۡطَ لِيَوۡمِ ٱلۡقِيَٰمَةِ فَلَا تُظۡلَمُ نَفۡسٞ شَيۡـٔٗاۖ وَإِن كَانَ مِثۡقَالَ حَبَّةٖ مِّنۡ خَرۡدَلٍ أَتَيۡنَا بِهَاۗ وَكَفَىٰ بِنَا حَٰسِبِينَWa nada'ul mawaazeenal qista li Yawmil Qiyaamati falaa tuzlamu nafsun shai'aa; wa in kaana misqaala habbatim min khardalin atainaa bihaa; wa kafaa binaa haasibeenEnglish Translation:""And We place the scales of justice for the Day of Resurrection, so no soul will be treated unjustly at all. And if there is [even] the weight of a mustard seed, We will bring it forth. And sufficient are We as accountant."" — (Qur'an 21:47)Among the disputed names:As we've mentioned in previous names, different scholars have different criteria for what qualifies as a name of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. Of the 99 names, 81 are explicitly mentioned in the Qur'an. Therefore, there is not one agreed-upon list for the remaining 18 names. Al-Muqsit is one of those names which is not included by certain scholars. This list includes Ibn al-Wazir, Ibn Hazm, and Ibn al-Uthaymeen. However, others, such as Ibn Arabi, Imam al-Bayhaqi, and Imam al-Ghazali, have included this name in their books of explanations of Asma ul-Husna. Still, many verses speak to Allah's nature as being equitable. ۞يَوۡمَ تَأۡتِي كُلُّ نَفۡسٖ تُجَٰدِلُ عَن نَّفۡسِهَا وَتُوَفَّىٰ كُلُّ نَفۡسٖ مَّا عَمِلَتۡ وَهُمۡ لَا يُظۡلَمُونَYawma taatee kullu nafsin tujaadilu ‘an nafsihaa wa tuwaffaa kullu nafsim maa ‘amilat wa hum laa yuzlamoonEnglish Translation:""On the Day when every soul will come disputing for itself, and every soul will be fully compensated for what it did, and they will not be wronged."" — (Qur'an 16:111) شَهِدَ ٱللَّهُ أَنَّهُۥ لَآ إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ وَٱلۡمَلَـٰٓئِكَةُ وَأُوْلُواْ ٱلۡعِلۡمِ قَآئِمَۢا بِٱلۡقِسۡطِۚ لَآ إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ ٱلۡعَزِيزُ ٱلۡحَكِيمُShahidal laahu annahoo laa ilaaha illaa Huwa walmalaaa'ikatu wa ulul ‘ilmi qaaa'imam bilqist; laaa ilaaha illaa Huwal ‘Azeezul HakeemEnglish Translation:""Allah witnesses that there is no deity except Him, and [so do] the angels and those of knowledge - [that He is] maintaining [creation] in justice. There is no deity except Him, the Exalted in Might, the Wise."" — (Qur'an 3:18)Reflection:Although the name Al-Muqsit is not mentioned, we are told on three separate occasions in the Qur'an that innal laaha yuhibbul muqsiteen, ""Indeed, Allah loves those who act justly."" The context in which each verse was revealed varies, but the overarching idea is Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ loves those who seek to do good for the sake of Allah.The three verses and their context, (1) The Medinah Jews came to the Prophet ﷺ trying to settle a matter of some unlawful they consumed. Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ at the time ordered to either help judge between them and give them the accurate Islamic ruling over the unlawful matter. The other option would be to turn them away - for if you turn them away, they can not harm you. سَمَّـٰعُونَ لِلۡكَذِبِ أَكَّـٰلُونَ لِلسُّحۡتِۚ فَإِن جَآءُوكَ فَٱحۡكُم بَيۡنَهُمۡ أَوۡ أَعۡرِضۡ عَنۡهُمۡۖ وَإِن تُعۡرِضۡ عَنۡهُمۡ فَلَن يَضُرُّوكَ شَيۡـٔٗاۖ وَإِنۡ حَكَمۡتَ فَٱحۡكُم بَيۡنَهُم بِٱلۡقِسۡطِۚ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُحِبُّ ٱلۡمُقۡسِطِينَSammaa'oona lilkazibi akkaaloona lissuht; fa in jaaa'ooka fahkum bainahum aw a'rid anhum wa in tu'rid ‘anhum falany-yadurrooka shai'anw wa in hakamta fahkum bainahum bilqist; innal laaha yuhibbul muqsiteenEnglish Translation:""[They are] avid listeners to falsehood, devourers of [what is] unlawful. So if they come to you, [O Muhammad], judge between them or turn away from them. And if you turn away from them - never will they harm you at all. And if you judge, judge between them with justice. Indeed, Allah loves those who act justly."" — (Qur'an 5:42)(2) It reserves the right of Muslims to remain peaceful amongst each other. Fighting should never occur internally, just as cursing amongst one another has been prohibited. If a dispute turns into a fight, help the victim fight against the one who's the aggressor, i.e., until cooler heads prevail. We should be loving and just amongst ourselves, not motivated by self-interest or by ties of kinship. وَإِن طَآئِفَتَانِ مِنَ ٱلۡمُؤۡمِنِينَ ٱقۡتَتَلُواْ فَأَصۡلِحُواْ بَيۡنَهُمَاۖ فَإِنۢ بَغَتۡ إِحۡدَىٰهُمَا عَلَى ٱلۡأُخۡرَىٰ فَقَٰتِلُواْ ٱلَّتِي تَبۡغِي حَتَّىٰ تَفِيٓءَ إِلَىٰٓ أَمۡرِ ٱللَّهِۚ فَإِن فَآءَتۡ فَأَصۡلِحُواْ بَيۡنَهُمَا بِٱلۡعَدۡلِ وَأَقۡسِطُوٓاْۖ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُحِبُّ ٱلۡمُقۡسِطِينَWa in taaa'ifataani minal mu'mineena naqtataloo fa aslihoo bainahumaa; fa-im baghat ihdaahumaa ‘alal ukhraa faqaatilul latee tabghee hattaa tafeee'a ilaaa amril laah; fa-in faaa'at fa aslihoo bainahumaa bil'adli wa aqsitoo, innal laaha yuhibbul muqsiteenEnglish Translation:""And if two factions among the believers should fight, then make settlement between the two. But if one of them oppresses the other, then fight against the one that oppresses until it returns to the ordinance of Allah. And if it returns, then make settlement between them in justice and act justly. Indeed, Allah loves those who act justly."" — (Qur'an 49:9)(3) The next verse encourages Muslims not to make enemies with all non-muslims. If the non-believers do not fight Islam and do not try to expel Muslims from their homes, then it is recommended in the Qur'an that we behave justly and righteously towards them. This ayah is reportedly believed to have been revealed in response to Abu Bakr's daughter, Asma, who refused to meet her mother when she came from Mecca because she remained a polytheist. The Prophet ﷺ was made aware of this situation, and the verse was revealed to Him in response. لَّا يَنۡهَىٰكُمُ ٱللَّهُ عَنِ ٱلَّذِينَ لَمۡ يُقَٰتِلُوكُمۡ فِي ٱلدِّينِ وَلَمۡ يُخۡرِجُوكُم مِّن دِيَٰرِكُمۡ أَن تَبَرُّوهُمۡ وَتُقۡسِطُوٓاْ إِلَيۡهِمۡۚ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُحِبُّ ٱلۡمُقۡسِطِينَLaa yanhaakumul laahu ‘anil lazeena lam yuqaatilookum fid deeni wa lam yukhrijookum min diyaarikum an tabarroohum wa tuqsitooo ilaihim; innal laaha yuhibbul muqsiteenEnglish Translation:""Allah does not forbid you from those who do not fight you because of religion and do not expel you from your homes - from being righteous toward them and acting justly toward them. Indeed, Allah loves those who act justly."" — (Qur'an 60:8)Seeking justice for when you are wrong:Much has already been said in the previous names regarding seeking Allah's forgiveness for our sins and ways in which we may have been deficient. But we may also benefit by looking at those we may have hurt and seeking their forgiveness directly.Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah's Messenger ﷺ said, ""Whoever has wronged his brother, should ask for his pardon (before his death), as (in the Hereafter) there will be neither a Dinar nor a Dirham. (He should secure pardon in this life) before some of his good deeds are taken and paid to his brother, or, if he has done no good deeds, some of the bad deeds of his brother are taken to be loaded on him (in the Hereafter). [1]The simple principle we should try applying in our life is to deal with people the way you would like Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ to deal with you. A person may have wronged you terribly, and you're confident you'll win this case on the day of judgment. But what about the thousands of cases others may have against you? What kind of precedent would you like established on the day of resurrection? No one can genuinely achieve Jannah on the basis of their deeds alone. Whatever we do will never be enough for us to confidently say we are deserving of paradise. Jannah is only achieved by Allah's grace and mercy. And so, what's best for the believer is to sincerely find it in their hearts to forgive and let go of the pain others may have caused. In doing so, you open yourself to receiving Allah's mercy.From the hadith, ""none can enter Paradise through his good deeds. They (the Prophet's companions) said, 'Not even you, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)?' He said, ""Not even myself, unless Allah bestows His favor and mercy on me.""

الْجَامِعُ,Al-Jami,The Gatherer,"The Unifier, The Uniter.","Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Jaami (in Arabic: ٱلْجَامِعُ), He is The One who has the power to assemble and arrange all that which has been dispersed. He is the one who composes and connects things together.","From the root jim-mim-ayn (ج م ع), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to collect, gather up, to congregate, gather together, to draw together, muster, to reconcile, to connect, combine, to form a connection between, union, to compose, arrange, resolve, or settle something.","Arabic Root:From the root jim-mim-ayn (ج م ع), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to collect, gather up, to congregate, gather together, to draw together, muster, to reconcile, to connect, combine, to form a connection between, union, to compose, arrange, resolve, or settle something.Among the disputed names:As we've mentioned in previous names, different scholars have different criteria for what qualifies as a name of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. Of the 99 names, 81 are explicitly mentioned in the Qur'an. Therefore, there is not one agreed-upon list for the remaining 18 names. Al-Jami is one of those names which is not included by certain scholars. This list includes Ibn al-Wazir, Ibn Hazm, and Ibn al-Uthaymeen. However, others, such as Ibn Arabi, Imam al-Bayhaqi, and al-Ghazali, have included this name in their books of explanations of Asma ul-Husna.The Gatherer:The word Jami is derived from Jama'a, which means to collect or gather. As with all the beautiful names of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ, Al-Jami is not limited or restricted in any manner. He is The Gatherer. He has the power to combine all things, whether similar or dissimilar, both in space and time. He brought together human beings, infused them with a spirit, and put them on earth. We can go further by analyzing the details of a single creation, the human body. Its composition is complex, consisting of many layers all working as one, circulatory system (blood, veins, arteries...), digestive system (teeth, saliva, stomach...), nervous system (brain, spine, nerves...), and the list goes on. This is the makeup of one of His creations on earth, and we'll avoid discussions of the stars, planets, and galaxies. أَيَحْسَبُ ٱلْإِنسَـٰنُ أَلَّن نَّجْمَعَ عِظَامَهُۥ بَلَىٰ قَـٰدِرِينَ عَلَىٰٓ أَن نُّسَوِّىَ بَنَانَهُۥ بَلْ يُرِيدُ ٱلْإِنسَـٰنُ لِيَفْجُرَ أَمَامَهُۥAyahsabul insaanu al lan najm'a ‘izaamah Balaa qaadireena ‘alaaa an nusawwiya banaanah Bal yureedul insaanu liyafjura amaamahEnglish Translation:""Does man think that We will not assemble his bones? Yes. [We are] Able [even] to proportion his fingertips. But man desires to continue in sin."" — (Qur'an 75:3-5)The gatherer also refers to how on the day of resurrection, we will all be brought back together, awaiting His final judgment. رَبَّنَآ إِنَّكَ جَامِعُ ٱلنَّاسِ لِيَوۡمٖ لَّا رَيۡبَ فِيهِۚ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَا يُخۡلِفُ ٱلۡمِيعَادَRabbanaaa innaka jaami un-naasil Yawmil laa raibafeeh; innal laaha laa yukhliful mee'aad (section 1)English Translation:""Our Lord, surely You will gather the people for a Day about which there is no doubt.

Every person, for what he earned, is retained."" — (Qur'an 52:21)Reflection:The believer benefits from knowing that Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Jami, i.e., the gatherer. We realize that our return will be back to Him, and we will be gathered together with all who've walked this earth. Upon reflection on this name, we ask ourselves whether we could say we've been a good representative of being one of Allah's servants? If not, what changes could we make starting today that would move us one step closer to that person?Imam al-Ghazali mentions our connection to this name is in integrating ""the external behavior of his limbs with the inner realities of his heart. The one who unites is one in whom knowledge is perfect and behaviour admirable."" To have the outer reflect the inner and to beautify them both."
ٱلْغَنيُّ,Al-Ghani / Al-Ghaniyy,The Self-Sufficient,"The Rich, The Independent One, The Wealthy.","Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Ghaniyy (in Arabic: ٱلْغَنيُّ), He is The One who is self-sufficient and independent. He does not need anything as He is completely satisfied and free from dependence. Allah is The One whose wealth and riches all others depend on.","From the root ghayn-nun-ya (غ ن ي), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be free from wants or needs, to be self-sufficient, independent, to be able to do without help from others, to be content, satisfied to be rich, wealthy, flourishing.","Arabic Root:From the root ghayn-nun-ya (غ ن ي), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be free from wants or needs, to be self-sufficient, independent, to be able to do without help from others, to be content, satisfied to be rich, wealthy, flourishing.The name of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ Al-Ghani, the rich or wealthy. This is one of the names of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ from the Qur'an as it is mentioned 18 times. It is often explained in pairs with Al-Mughni (The Enricher) for its closeness in meaning. But just as a note to self, Al-Mughni is one of the names where there isn't a consensus as being accepted as an official name of Allah as it's not mentioned in the Qur'an.The word ghni (غْنِيَ) is often said to imply rich or wealthy. In the Qur'an, ""Allah has certainly heard the statement of those [Jews] who said, innal laaha faqeerunw wa nahnu aghniyaaa ""Indeed, Allah is poor, while we are rich."" (Qur'an 3:181). In a hadith qudsi, the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ related Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ as saying, ""[...] O My servants, were the first of you and the last of you, the human of you and the jinn of you to rise up in one place and make a request of Me, and were I to give everyone what he requested, that would not decrease what I have, any more that a needle decreases the sea if put into it.""[1] This is how vast Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ wealth is. If every creation, human and jinn, both past, and present, were to ask Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ their innermost desire, and He was to give it to you, it would deplete Him as much as if you were to dip a needle in the ocean and try and remove some water with it. This is how rich Al-Ghaniyy is. His ability to provide is non-diminishable.Living the rich life:Now, if you were to ask Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ to gift you with a rich life, what would that mean? One dimension may include monetary success. But if that's all you care about, you'll have missed the aim of what a truly rich life is. Imagine a person who's been given wealth by Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ but with it a short lifespan, health problems, minimal love and support from friends or family, with limited capacity to think and reason. Would you say they are living a rich life? Their wish will have been wasted as they haven't even considered the purpose of their existence, which is to glorify and worship Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. They'll go through their entire life aimlessly, and on the day of resurrection, they'll be lost.This is to illustrate that when we refer to Al-Ghani as rich, we don't mean in one aspect. But rather, He is abundant in all respects (i.e., knowledge, power, influence, might, time, etc.) In this light, we can see why Al-Ghaniy is often translated as 'The Self-Sufficient.' He is without the need for anything as He has it all. He is independent and entirely satisfied. قَالَ ٱلَّذِي عِندَهُۥ عِلۡمٞ مِّنَ ٱلۡكِتَٰبِ أَنَا۠ ءَاتِيكَ بِهِۦ قَبۡلَ أَن يَرۡتَدَّ إِلَيۡكَ طَرۡفُكَۚ فَلَمَّا رَءَاهُ مُسۡتَقِرًّا عِندَهُۥ قَالَ هَٰذَا مِن فَضۡلِ رَبِّي لِيَبۡلُوَنِيٓ ءَأَشۡكُرُ أَمۡ أَكۡفُرُۖ وَمَن شَكَرَ فَإِنَّمَا يَشۡكُرُ لِنَفۡسِهِۦۖ وَمَن كَفَرَ فَإِنَّ رَبِّي غَنِيّٞ كَرِيمٞQaalal lazee indahoo ‘ilmum minal Kitaabi ana aateeka bihee qabla ai yartadda ilaika tarfuk; falammaa ra aahu mustaqirran ‘indahoo qaala haazaa min fadli Rabbee li yabluwaneee ‘a-ashkuru am akfuru wa man shakara fa innamaa yashkuru linafsihee wa man kafara fa inna Rabbee Ghaniyyun KareemEnglish Translation:""Said one who had knowledge from the Scripture, 'I will bring it to you before your glance returns to you.' And when [Solomon] saw it placed before him, he said, 'This is from the favor of my Lord to test me whether I will be grateful or ungrateful.

And whoever is ungrateful - then indeed, my Lord is Free of need and Generous.'"" — (Qur'an 27:40) وَرَبُّكَ ٱلْغَنِىُّ ذُو ٱلرَّحْمَةِ ۚ إِن يَشَأْ يُذْهِبْكُمْ وَيَسْتَخْلِفْ مِنۢ بَعْدِكُم مَّا يَشَآءُ كَمَآ أَنشَأَكُم مِّن ذُرِّيَّةِ قَوْمٍ ءَاخَرِينَWa Rabbukal ghaniyyu zur rahmah; iny yasha' yuz hibkum wa yastakhlif mim ba'dikum maa yashaaa'u kamaaa ansha akum min zurriyyati qawmin aakhareenEnglish Translation:""And your Lord is the Free of need, the possessor of mercy. If He wills, he can do away with you and give succession after you to whomever He wills, just as He produced you from the descendants of another people."" — (Qur'an 6:133)The Promise of Iblees:Sometimes we can be very unappreciative of the blessings Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ has given us. He's provided for us, and we are not aware. We are not satiated by the things we possess. This is the curse of shaitan to look for the next thing, then the next thing, and after that, there is something else for us to fixate on. We are only finished chasing when we have reached our graves. This was the promise of Iblees. He vowed to make man ungrateful after his refusal to bow down to Adam (as), ""Then I will come to them from before them and from behind them and on their right and on their left, and You will not find most of them grateful [to You]."" (Qur'an 7:17) In the prophetic traditions of Muhammad ﷺ, you will find the best example of behavior. He never praised food or drink. He would express gratitude towards the one who prepared it. Abu Sa'id al-Khudri told that when God's messenger finished his food he said, ""Praise be to God who has given us food and drink and made us Muslims."" [2] and also, Anas said, ""When the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went to bed, he said, 'Praise be to Allah who has given us food and drink, and given us enough and given us refuge. How many people have neither enough nor refuge!'"" [3] This is what it means to be cognizant of Allah's blessings.Nothing can stand on human ambition and ability alone, we may be deluded to think so, but all success comes from Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. Do we fail to recognize His blessings? He's given the ability to see, breathe, hear, think, reflect, and love. This name of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ should instill humility in the believer's heart. It should cause us to think about Him and see the blessings He's put around us. Every day we have food to eat, and we wake up and have the opportunity to spend time with our beautiful children, spouse, friends, and/or family. This is all a blessing of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. ۞قَوۡلٞ  مَّعۡرُوفٞ  وَمَغۡفِرَةٌ  خَيۡرٞ  مِّن  صَدَقَةٖ  يَتۡبَعُهَآ  أَذٗىۗ  وَٱللَّهُ  غَنِيٌّ  حَلِيمٞQawlum ma'roofunw wa maghfiratun khairum min sadaqatiny yatba'uhaaa azaa; wallaahu Ghaniyyun HaleemEnglish Translation:""Kind speech and forgiveness are better than charity followed by injury. And Allah is Free of need and Forbearing."" — (Qur'an 2:263)Reflection:We can call upon Al-Ghani (The Rich) and Al-Mughni (The Enricher) whenever you are in need. Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is unlimited, and we should never fear asking of Him because who else would you then ask? The balance is that we should be careful to not be ungrateful or unsatisfied with the gifts He has already given us. Be deliberate in your worldly desires. If it benefits you, then ask of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. But if you only want something out of greed, pride, or to rise in social rankings, we should think twice about its importance. What would be best for the believer is to live a life of detachment just as Prophet Muhammad ﷺ did. For the one who has no need for anything but Allah, سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is the richest among the people.Ali (ra) narrated: that a Mukatib came to him and said: “Indeed I am not capable of my Kitabah so aid me.” He said: “Should I not teach you words that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) taught me? If you had a debt upon you similar to the mountain of Sir, Allah would fulfill it for you. He said: [4]اللَّهُمَّ اكْفِنِي بِحَلاَلِكَ عَنْ حَرَامِكَ وَأَغْنِنِي بِفَضْلِكَ عَمَّنْ سِوَاكَAllahummakfini bihalalika `an haramika, wa aghnini bi fadlika `amman siwakaEnglish Translation:""O Allah, suffice me with Your lawful against Your prohibited, and make me independent of all those besides You""This is a beautiful supplication to ask Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ to help aid us in debts. But more generally, it is also both du'a of gratitude and detachment. Asking Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ to make us independent, free from all wants. We don't necessarily need more than we currently have in order to be at peace. This applies in the realm of rizq to make our careers enough for us, so we don't fall into prohibited acts of usury, cheating, stealing, etc. It also applies to marriages. To make us sufficient in our relationships, not desiring anything outside that has been forbidden.A look into how the Prophet ﷺ lived:In one of the longer hadith narrations, Umar bin Al-Khattab was said to visit the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ in his house, and what he saw made him cry. ""Why are you weeping?' Umar replied, ""O Allah's Messenger ﷺ! Caesar and Khosrau are leading the life (i.e., Luxurious life) while you, Allah's Messenger ﷺ though you are, is living in destitute"". The Prophet ﷺ then replied, 'Won't you be satisfied that they enjoy this world and we the Hereafter?'"" [5] Umar in the hadith describes the poverty-stricken lifestyle of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ in the hadith. He entered the home of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ to find him lying on a mat made of palm tree leaves. There was nothing to separate Prophet Muhammad ﷺ from the mat. When he got off the mat, you could visibly see the branch marks it left on his body. When he saw these marks, Umar began to weep. Even as the economic conditions of the Muslims improved, the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ stayed humble. Even in poverty, he ﷺ was offered many bribes by Pagan leaders to abandon his campaign, and he always denied it because with Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ He was sufficient.References:[1] Sahih Muslim 2577a[2] Mishkat al-Masabih 4204[3] Sahih (Al-Albani) Al-Adab Al-Mufrad Book 50, Hadith 1206 [4] Hasan (Darussalam) Jami` at-Tirmidhi 3563[5] Sahih al-Bukhari 4913"
ٱلْمُغْنِيُّ,Al-Mughni,The Enricher,"The Emancipator, The Fulfiller of Needs, The Bestower of Wealth.","Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Mughni (in Arabic: ٱلْمُغْنِيُّ), He is The One who gives abundantly and provides all that is needed. He enriches all of creation so that they may be satisfied and content.","From the root ghayn-nun-ya (غ ن ي), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be free from wants or needs, to be self-sufficient, independent, to be able to do without help from others, to be content, satisfied to be rich, wealthy, flourishing.","Arabic Root:From the root ghayn-nun-ya (غ ن ي), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be free from wants or needs, to be self-sufficient, independent, to be able to do without help from others, to be content, satisfied to be rich, wealthy, flourishing.Two names are often mentioned in pairs, Al-Ghani (The Rich/The Self Sufficient) and Al-Mughni (The Enricher). You should read the write-up for the name Al-Ghani to more deeply understand the name Al-Mughni. As a note, Al-Ghani is a name mentioned in the Qur'an 18 times, whereas scholars do not unanimously recognize Al-Mughni as it's not mentioned in the Qur'an.To provide a quick summary, the name Al-Ghani implies that Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is free from wants, independent, and self-sufficient. It's because of this nature of being fully satisfied and abundant that makes Him Al-Mughni, The Enricher. He is not only rich in a monetary sense but in all regards. He is the one needed and whose riches all others depend on. Now, Al-Mughni is the ultimate fulfiller of needs.How to ask from Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ:There are two aspects of this, ask from Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ when you are needy. But to also not deny or belittle the blessings He's already given (see Al-Ghani for further clarification). There is a belief among scholars that there is a methodology or certain things a person can do to increase the chance of their du'a being fulfilled. Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ says in Surah Baqarah, ""[...] I respond to the invocation of the supplicant when he calls upon Me. So let them respond to Me [by obedience] and believe in Me that they may be [rightly] guided."" (Qur'an 2:186) Allah is near to those who call upon Him, but He asks in return that we be obedient to what He has asked of us. This is part of the concept of tawassul. By increasing your nearness to Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ with actions beloved to Him, you increase the likelihood of obtaining His favor. After Prophet Zakariya (as) made du'a, we're told in the Qur'an, ""So We responded to him, and We gave to him John, and amended for him his wife. Indeed, they used to hasten to good deeds and supplicate Us in hope and fear, and they were to Us humbly submissive."" (Qur'an 21:90)Another shift we can make is going from an egocentric view to making a du'a in complete submission to Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. The idea is sometimes we make our du'a, and we only focus on the self. I need this, and I need that. Please make this happen. There is nothing wrong with this view, Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Mughni, and there is nothing He can't do. But note in the du'a of Prophet Zakariya (as), ""My Lord, grant me from Yourself a good offspring. Indeed, You are the Hearer of supplication."" (Qur'an 3:38) and also, ""My Lord, do not leave me alone [with no heir], while you are the best of inheritors."" (Qur'an 21:89) The importance is placed on seeking it from the one who can provide you it. Both du'as begin with exalting Him, Rabbanna ""My Lord,"" all things come from yourself, so grant me this, you're the hearer of supplication, you're the best of inheritors, so provide for me. أَمَّن يُجِيبُ ٱلْمُضْطَرَّ إِذَا دَعَاهُ وَيَكْشِفُ ٱلسُّوٓءَ وَيَجْعَلُكُمْ خُلَفَآءَ ٱلْأَرْضِ ۗ أَءِلَـٰهٌۭ مَّعَ ٱللَّهِ ۚ قَلِيلًۭا مَّا تَذَكَّرُونَ أَمَّن يَهْدِيكُمْ فِى ظُلُمَـٰتِ ٱلْبَرِّ وَٱلْبَحْرِ وَمَن يُرْسِلُ ٱلرِّيَـٰحَ بُشْرًۢا بَيْنَ يَدَىْ رَحْمَتِهِۦٓ ۗ أَءِلَـٰهٌۭ مَّعَ ٱللَّهِ ۚ تَعَـٰلَى ٱللَّهُ عَمَّا يُشْرِكُونَAmmany-yujeebul mud tarra izaa da'aahu wa yakshifus sooo'a wa yaj'alukum khula faaa'al ardi ‘a-ilaahun ma'allah qaleelan maa tazak karoon Ammany-yahdeekum fee zulumaatil barri wal bahri wa many yursilu riyaaha bushran baina yadai rahmatih; ‘a-ilaahun ma'allah; Ta'aalal laahu ‘ammaa yushrikoon English Translation:""Is He [not best] who responds to the desperate one when he calls upon Him and removes evil and makes you inheritors of the earth? Is there a deity with Allah? Little do you remember. Is He [not best] who guides you through the darknesses of the land and sea and who sends the winds as good tidings before His mercy? Is there a deity with Allah? High is Allah above whatever they associate with Him."" — (Qur'an 27:62-63)Being vulnerable in your du'a:We can also use our state or circumstance and say, ""Oh Allah, I am faqeer (فقیر‎),"" meaning from poverty or in a dire state. From this ayah, we learn that Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ loves to respond to the desperate cry of His believer. The subtle spiritual shift is from revolving around your needs to sincere submission and reliance upon Allah. Directing your heart in neediness to receive from Him and His beautiful attributes. Of course, following these criteria is not always necessary. Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is most merciful and gives to whom He wills. But we should be aware of the actions beloved to Him and seek His approval through such manners. وَأَنَّهُۥ هُوَ أَغْنَىٰ وَأَقْنَىٰWa annahoo huwa aghnaa wa aqnaaEnglish Translation:""And that it is He who enriches and suffices."" — (Qur'an 53:48)From the story of Musa (as):Another example of proper du'a etiquette is shown in the story of Musa (as). After escaping Egypt to avoid persecution, he traveled through the desert until he came across a group of male shepherds watering their flocks at a well. Keeping their distance, he noticed two women waiting in the back with their sheep. Why? For whatever reason, they felt safer waiting than mixing with the men who were gathered at the well. They explained to Musa (as) that their father was an older man and unable to feed their flock, so they had to take on this duty. Now, keep in mind that Musa (as) himself was disheveled and exhausted from his travels. He likely did not have much to eat or drink. Still, he empathized with the girls, ""So he watered (their flocks) for them; then he turned back to the shade…."" As he turned back to the shade, he recited the following du'a. فَسَقَىٰ لَهُمَا ثُمَّ تَوَلَّىٰٓ إِلَى ٱلظِّلِّ فَقَالَ رَبِّ إِنِّي لِمَآ أَنزَلۡتَ إِلَيَّ مِنۡ خَيۡرٖ فَقِيرٞFasaqaa lahumaa summa tawallaaa ilaz zilli faqaala Rabbi innee limaaa anzalta ilaiya min khairin faqeerEnglish Translation:""So he watered [their flocks] for them; then he went back to the shade and said, 'My Lord, indeed I am, for whatever good You would send down to me, in need.'"" — (Qur'an 28:24)He was in a dire state and made this plea before Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ to send down more good. He knew he was impoverished and saw that the opportunity which presented itself was a gift from Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ and he was in need of more. It's a beautiful du'a that asks from Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ but also keeps in mind the role we play as well.Reflection:The ways in which the believer can try to connect with this name is to spend their time busying themselves in the service to others. You can enrich your soul by trying to enrich the lives of others. Shaykh Tosun Bayrak wrote, ""become an instrument of satisfying the needs of the needy"" in both the realms of the material and spiritual. We can see this quality through the stories told about Prophet Muhammad ﷺ.Jabir b. Abdullah reported: It never happened that Allah's Messenger ﷺ was asked for anything, and he said: No. [1] The Prophet Muhammad ﷺ character was perfect. Whenever someone came to him asking for help, he could not find in his heart to turn them away. He would spend his time being of service, which is part of what made him so loved among the companions. He was there for them, and they knew it.Anas b. Malik (ra) reported: I served the Messenger of Allah ﷺ for ten years, and, by Allah, he never said to me any harsh word, and he never said to me about a thing as to why I had done that and as to why I had not done that. [2] The Prophet ﷺ never tried to spread negativity, hatred, or curse those around him. He never questioned why Anas ibn Malik (ra) did something or did not do something. This does not mean he was passive, either. All we can infer from this is the supreme leadership skills he possessed.What reputation follows us? How would someone speak of working with you after spending ten years together? Did you try to uplift others? Were you supportive? Or would they say you complained frequently and brought everyone down?We can never be truly devoid of needs; we are human beings with desires and needs. But as mentioned in Al-Ghani, we can work on being deliberate in our worldly desires. If it benefits you, then ask of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ who is Al-Ghani and Al-Mughni. But if you only want something out of greed, pride, or to rise in social rankings, we should think twice about its importance. It's possible to have 1 million dollars and still believe you don't have enough. You may have friends who have boats and multi-million dollar mansions, making you feel less than. This is why it's been famously said it is not greed that drives the world but envy. Today, we have fridges, cars, video games, computers, phones, and on-demand food delivery service. The average person is living better than kings a thousand years ago. But do you feel like a king? In Al-Ghani, we mentioned how Umar (ra) cried when he saw how the Prophet ﷺ was living. This house had one bed, a few cloth and pots, black curtains, water skins that hung above his bed, and an uncomfortable mat that left marks on his body. When Prophet Muhammad ﷺ was asked about this, ""Won't you be satisfied that they enjoy this world and we the Hereafter?"" So it is possible we have been enriched by Al-Mughni and not even realized it.Ali (ra) narrated: that a Mukatib came to him and said: ""Indeed I am not capable of my Kitabah so aid me."" He said: ""Should I not teach you words that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) taught me? If you had a debt upon you similar to the mountain of Sir, Allah would fulfill it for you."" He said: [3]اللَّهُمَّ اكْفِنِي بِحَلاَلِكَ عَنْ حَرَامِكَ وَأَغْنِنِي بِفَضْلِكَ عَمَّنْ سِوَاكَAllahummakfini bihalalika `an haramika, wa aghnini bi fadlika `amman siwakaEnglish Translation:""O Allah, suffice me with Your lawful against Your prohibited, and make me independent of all those besides You""References:[1] Sahih Muslim 2311a[2] Sahih al-Bukhari 6038 and Sahih Muslim 2309d[3] Hasan (Darussalam) Jami` at-Tirmidhi 3563"
اَلْمَانِعُ,Al-Mani,The Withholder,"The Shielder, The Protector, The Preventer.",Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Mani (in Arabic: ٱلْمَانِعُ). There is no one to give what he's withheld or to prevent what He gives. He protects people from harmful situations and prevents undesirable actions. All is done according to His infinite wisdom and mercy.,"From the root mim-nun-ayn (م ن ع), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to prevent, hinder, hold back, restrain, deny, impede, resist, forbid, refuse, prohibit, to guard, defend, or to protect.","Arabic Root:From the root mim-nun-ayn (م ن ع), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to prevent, hinder, hold back, restrain, deny, impede, resist, forbid, refuse, prohibit, to guard, defend, or to protect.Among the disputed names:The name of Allah, Al-Mani, The Protector. As we've mentioned in previous names, different scholars have different criteria for what qualifies as a name of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. Of the 99 names, 81 are explicitly mentioned in the Qur'an. Therefore, there is not one agreed-upon list for the remaining 18 names. Al-Mani is one of those names that certain scholars do not include. This list includes Ibn al-Wazir, Ibn Hazm, and Ibn al-Uthaymeen, among others. However, others, such as Ibn Arabi, Imam al-Bayhaqi, and al-Ghazali, have included this name in their lists.Al-Mani is the one who gives and the one who withholds. When He gives, nothing can come in its way to prevent it. If he decides to withhold, no one can substitute and give it instead. Al-Hafeedh (The Protector) and Al-Qabid (The Restricting) are similar in meaning to this name. As we mention in the name Al-Qabid, Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ can give and prevent for whomever. Whatever Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ wills is good since it's from Him. He can dispose of His dominion however He wishes. It is not up to us to judge whether a thing is good or bad. And He's not limited in what He can do; this goes back to the attributes of power, control, and supreme authority. He is Al-Wahhab (The Bestower of Gifts) and the opposite in meaning Al-Mani (The Preventer). However, the name Al-Mani can also connotate positive prevention with His infinite wisdom, judgment, and mercy. His withholding is a defense or a shield from what we do not know. مَّآ أَفَآءَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ رَسُولِهِۦ مِنۡ أَهۡلِ ٱلۡقُرَىٰ فَلِلَّهِ وَلِلرَّسُولِ وَلِذِي ٱلۡقُرۡبَىٰ وَٱلۡيَتَٰمَىٰ وَٱلۡمَسَٰكِينِ وَٱبۡنِ ٱلسَّبِيلِ كَيۡ لَا يَكُونَ دُولَةَۢ بَيۡنَ ٱلۡأَغۡنِيَآءِ مِنكُمۡۚ وَمَآ ءَاتَىٰكُمُ ٱلرَّسُولُ فَخُذُوهُ وَمَا نَهَىٰكُمۡ عَنۡهُ فَٱنتَهُواْۚ وَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَۖ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ شَدِيدُ ٱلۡعِقَابِMaaa afaaa'al laahu 'alaa Rasoolihee min ahlil quraa falillaahi wa lir Rasooli wa lizil qurbaa wal yataamaa walmasaakeeni wabnis sabeeli kai laa yakoona doolatam bainal aghniyaaa'i minkum; wa maaa aataakumur Rasoolu fakhuzoohu wa maa nahaakum 'anhu fantahoo; wattaqul laaha innal laaha shadeedul-‘iqaabEnglish Translation:""And what Allah restored to His Messenger from the people of the towns - it is for Allah and for the Messenger and for [his] near relatives and orphans and the [stranded] traveler - so that it will not be a perpetual distribution among the rich from among you.

His is the Kingdom and all praise, and Omnipotent is he. O Allah! Nobody can hold back what you gave, nobody can give what You held back, and no struggler's effort can benefit against You"" أَمَّنۡ هَٰذَا ٱلَّذِي يَرۡزُقُكُمۡ إِنۡ أَمۡسَكَ رِزۡقَهُۥۚ بَل لَّجُّواْ فِي عُتُوّٖ وَنُفُورٍAmman haazal lazee yarzuqukum in amsaka rizqah; bal lajjoo fee ‘utuwwinw wa nufoorEnglish Translation:""Or who is it that could provide for you if He withheld His provision? But they have persisted in insolence and aversion."" — (Qur'an 67:21)Reflection:When we think about Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ we are in no position to expect or demand anything. We have no authority or right to demand that we get all that we desire. Just like a father or mother who withholds things from a child, it is out of compassion and wisdom.We must remember whatever the mind focuses on is what we'll notice. We can look to see the many blessings already bestowed by His quality of being Al-Khaliq, Al-Wahhab, and Ar-Razzaq. He created us, gave us the gift of life, and continues to provide sustenance in every moment. In death, we are reminded, inna lillahi wa inna ilayhi raji'un ""to Allah we belong and to him we shall return."" We may be independent in our actions and responsibilities, but we belong to Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ, and we exist under His dominion and rule.In times of difficulty, practice sabr (patience), and Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ will reward you for how well His servant responded to the adversity. Ask yourself a simple question, how would The Prophet ﷺ respond to this happening? In studying His biography, sayings, and teachings, we can try and approximate to the best way we should react to certain events. And remember, there is always some reward you can gain from either situation.References:[1] Sahih al-Bukhari 844"
الضَّارَ,Adh-Dharr,The Distresser,"The Balancer, The Punisher, The Harmer.","Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Ad-Darr (in Arabic: ٱلْضَّارُ), The One who harms or benefits whoever He wills. He is the one whose wisdom may choose to use forceful corrections to discourage wrongful behavior.","From the root dad-ra-ra (ض ر ر), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to have an opinion that is opposing, to apply forceful correction, to do an act that is disliked making inconvenient, annoy, distress, to cause adversity, afflict, to harm, injure, and hurt.","Arabic Root:From the root dad-ra-ra (ض ر ر), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to have an opinion that is opposing, to apply forceful correction, to do an act that is disliked making inconvenient, annoy, distress, to cause adversity, afflict, to harm, injure, and hurt.Among the disputed names:As we've mentioned in previous names, different scholars have different criteria for what qualifies as a name of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. Of the 99 names, 81 are explicitly mentioned in the Qur'an. Therefore, there is not one agreed-upon list for the remaining 18 names. Adh-Darr & An-Nafi are among those names which are not included by certain scholars. This list includes Ibn al-Wazir, Ibn Hazm, and Ibn al-Uthaymeen, among others. However, others, such as Ibn Arabi, Imam al-Bayhaqi, and Imam al-Ghazali, have included these names in their lists.Complimentary Devine Names:The names Al-Nafi and Ad-Darr (The one who benefits and The one who harms) are often explained in pairs to acknowledge their opposing nature. To explain each name in isolation is to break the harmony and provide an inaccurate or less comprehensive depiction of who Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is. The same is true of Al-Qabid (The Restrictor) and Al-Basit (The Expander), Al-Awwal (The First) and Al-Akhir (The Last).Duality of good and evil:All things come from Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ, but the proper prescribed Islamic etiquette (Adab - good manners) is to not attribute evil with Allah. Yes, it is Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ who punishes the disobedient, and on the day of judgment, He passes His verdict on whether we will attain paradise. We should be fearful and wish to avoid His punishment. This is part of having taqwa. But let's not forget all His other attributes, how He is Al-Hakam (The Impartial Judge) and Al-Adl (The Embodiment of Justice). Imam Zarruq writes of Ad-Darr and An-Nafi, ""He is the One who decrees harm and benefit, and who causes either of the two to reach whoever He wills in whichever manner He wills, justly in the case of the former, and out of bountiful favour in respect of the latter, and Allah knows best.""I am doubtful many of us would opt into living in a real anarchist society without law enforcement or governing authority. That an individual is free to do whatever they prefer. Similarly, Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is the ruling governing body over this world and the hereafter. He created both good and bad, and He gave us the judgment to discern between the two and encouraged us to seek good.The character of Prophet Ibrahim (as): فَإِنَّهُمْ عَدُوٌّۭ لِّىٓ إِلَّا رَبَّ ٱلْعَـٰلَمِينَ ٱلَّذِى خَلَقَنِى فَهُوَ يَهْدِينِ وَٱلَّذِى هُوَ يُطْعِمُنِى وَيَسْقِينِ وَإِذَا مَرِضْتُ فَهُوَ يَشْفِينِFa innahum ‘aduwwwul leee illaa Rabbal ‘aalameen Allazee khalaqanee fa Huwa yahdeen Wallazee Huwa yut'imunee wa yasqeen Wa izaa maridtu fahuwa yashfeenEnglish Translation:""Indeed, they are enemies to me, except the Lord of the worlds, Who created me, and He [it is who] guides me. And it is He who feeds me and gives me drink. And when I am ill, it is He who cures me."" — (Qur'an 26:77-80)Note the exemplary manners of Prophet Ibrahim (as) in this ayat. It recognizes Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ as being the cause of everything, Lord of the worlds, the one who creates and gives sustenance. But when it comes to sickness, He refuses to attribute any malice to Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ and instead says, ""when I am ill."" He then continues recognizing Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ as being the healer of the sickness. أَيۡنَمَا تَكُونُواْ يُدۡرِككُّمُ ٱلۡمَوۡتُ وَلَوۡ كُنتُمۡ فِي بُرُوجٖ مُّشَيَّدَةٖۗ وَإِن تُصِبۡهُمۡ حَسَنَةٞ يَقُولُواْ هَٰذِهِۦ مِنۡ عِندِ ٱللَّهِۖ وَإِن تُصِبۡهُمۡ سَيِّئَةٞ يَقُولُواْ هَٰذِهِۦ مِنۡ عِندِكَۚ قُلۡ كُلّٞ مِّنۡ عِندِ ٱللَّهِۖ فَمَالِ هَـٰٓؤُلَآءِ ٱلۡقَوۡمِ لَا يَكَادُونَ يَفۡقَهُونَ حَدِيثٗاAyna maa takoonoo yudrikkumul mawtu wa law kuntum fee buroojim mushai yadah; wa in tusibhum hasanatuny yaqooloo haazihee min indil laahi wa in tusibhum saiyi'atuny yaqooloo haazihee min ‘indik; qul kullum min ‘indillaahi famaa lihaaa ‘ulaaa'il qawmi laa yakaadoona yafqahoona hadeesaaEnglish Translation:""Wherever you may be, death will overtake you, even if you should be within towers of lofty construction. But if good comes to them, they say, “This is from Allah “; and if evil befalls them, they say, “This is from you.” Say, “All [things] are from Allah.” So what is [the matter] with those people that they can hardly understand any statement?"" — (Qur'an 4:78)In another example, when Surah An-Nisa Ayah 123 was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, it worried the sahabah. Abu Bakr asked Prophet Muhammad ﷺ about this verse:  O Messenger of Allah, how could we be in a good state after this verse: ""It will not be in accordance with your desires, nor those of the people of the Scripture, whosoever works evil, will have the recompense thereof (4:123)? Will we be punished for every bad deed we do? There Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: ""May Allah forgive you, O Abu Bakr, do you not fall sick? Do you not get exhausted? Do you not feel sad? Don't calamities befall you?"" He said: Of course. He said: ""That is the recompense you are given."" [1]So what we learn from this is Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Ad-Darr (the one who causes harm), but it is never senseless or without benefit. Remember, Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is also Al-Haleem (Forbearing) and As-Sabur (Patient). So, often what is best for the believer is to ask for forgiveness and to be steadfast and perseverant if faced with difficulties.Ibrahim (as) and the fire:Imam al-Ghazali mentions that anything that happens (good or bad) does not occur without the will of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. The example Imam al-Ghazali gives is not to suppose ""poison kills or harms by itself, or that food satisfies or benefits by itself; or that kings or men or Satan, or any creature - be they heavenly bodies or stars or anything else are capable of good or evil, benefit or harm, by themselves."" All that happens is because of the will of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. He's allowed for the medicine to cure, the poison to harm, and for Iblees and mankind to exist. Another example of this is fire. It is neither good nor bad, but Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ makes it so. When Nimrod threatened to kill Ibrahim (as) he threw him into the fire, ""Allah said, 'O fire, be coolness and safety upon Abraham.' And they intended for him harm, but We made them the greatest losers."" (Qur'an 21:69-70) To a person who has the support of Al-Nafi (The Benefactor), nothing can harm them.Reflection:And so, the believer benefits from knowing these two names of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. We further recognize that it is only Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ who has absolute power to benefit or cause harm. When you're stricken with fear, sickness, or poverty, know that it is from Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ and only He can dispel it. When blessed with happiness, wealth, or good health, it is from Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ, and only He can sustain it.We must further reflect upon our lives and ask ourselves what things are causing us harm mentally, spiritually, and physically. Once identified, seek to limit or eliminate. Alternatively, be conscious and seek things that benefit you. Find ways to incorporate them and make them part of your daily routine. Be grateful and thankful to Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ for allowing these blessings, as we must realize it is all from Him. وَلَا تَدۡعُ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ مَا لَا يَنفَعُكَ وَلَا يَضُرُّكَۖ فَإِن فَعَلۡتَ فَإِنَّكَ إِذٗا مِّنَ ٱلظَّـٰلِمِينَWa laa tad'u min doonil laahi maa laa yanfa'uka wa laa yadurruk; fa in fa'alta fa innaka izam minaz zaalimeenEnglish Translation:""And do not invoke besides Allah that which neither benefits you nor harms you, for if you did, then indeed you would be of the wrongdoers.'"" — (Qur'an 10:106) قُلۡ أَنَدۡعُواْ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ مَا لَا يَنفَعُنَا وَلَا يَضُرُّنَا وَنُرَدُّ عَلَىٰٓ أَعۡقَابِنَا بَعۡدَ إِذۡ هَدَىٰنَا ٱللَّهُ كَٱلَّذِي ٱسۡتَهۡوَتۡهُ ٱلشَّيَٰطِينُ فِي ٱلۡأَرۡضِ حَيۡرَانَ لَهُۥٓ أَصۡحَٰبٞ يَدۡعُونَهُۥٓ إِلَى ٱلۡهُدَى ٱئۡتِنَاۗ قُلۡ إِنَّ هُدَى ٱللَّهِ هُوَ ٱلۡهُدَىٰۖ وَأُمِرۡنَا لِنُسۡلِمَ لِرَبِّ ٱلۡعَٰلَمِينَQul anad'oo min doonil laahi maa laa yanfa'unaa wa laa yadurrunaa wa nuraddu ‘alaaa a'qaabina ba'da iz hadaanal laahu kallazis tahwat hush Shayaateenu fil ardi hairaana lahooo ashaabuny yad'oo nahooo ilal huda' tinaa; qul inna hudal laahi huwal hudaa wa umirnaa linuslima li Rabbil ‘aalameenEnglish Translation:Say, ""Shall we invoke instead of Allah that which neither benefits us nor harms us and be turned back on our heels after Allah has guided us?

However, others, such as Ibn Arabi, Imam al-Bayhaqi, and Imam al-Ghazali, have included these names in their lists.Complimentary Devine Names:The names Al-Nafi and Ad-Darr (The one who benefits and The one who harms) are often explained in pairs to acknowledge their opposing nature. To explain each name in isolation is to break the harmony and provide an inaccurate or less comprehensive depiction of who Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is. The same is true of Al-Qabid (The Restrictor) and Al-Basit (The Expander), Al-Awwal (The First) and Al-Akhir (The Last).Duality of good and evil:All things come from Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ, but the proper prescribed Islamic etiquette (Adab - good manners) is to not attribute evil with Allah. Yes, it is Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ who punishes the disobedient, and on the day of judgment, He passes His verdict on whether we will attain paradise. We should be fearful and wish to avoid His punishment. This is part of having taqwa. But let's not forget all His other attributes, how He is Al-Hakam (The Impartial Judge) and Al-Adl (The Embodiment of Justice). Imam Zarruq writes of Ad-Darr and An-Nafi, ""He is the One who decrees harm and benefit, and who causes either of the two to reach whoever He wills in whichever manner He wills, justly in the case of the former, and out of bountiful favour in respect of the latter, and Allah knows best.""I am doubtful many of us would opt into living in a real anarchist society without law enforcement or governing authority. That an individual is free to do whatever they prefer. Similarly, Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is the ruling governing body over this world and the hereafter. He created both good and bad, and He gave us the judgment to discern between the two and encouraged us to seek good.The character of Prophet Ibrahim (as): فَإِنَّهُمْ عَدُوٌّۭ لِّىٓ إِلَّا رَبَّ ٱلْعَـٰلَمِينَ ٱلَّذِى خَلَقَنِى فَهُوَ يَهْدِينِ وَٱلَّذِى هُوَ يُطْعِمُنِى وَيَسْقِينِ وَإِذَا مَرِضْتُ فَهُوَ يَشْفِينِFa innahum ‘aduwwwul leee illaa Rabbal ‘aalameen Allazee khalaqanee fa Huwa yahdeen Wallazee Huwa yut'imunee wa yasqeen Wa izaa maridtu fahuwa yashfeenEnglish Translation:""Indeed, they are enemies to me, except the Lord of the worlds, Who created me, and He [it is who] guides me. And it is He who feeds me and gives me drink. And when I am ill, it is He who cures me."" — (Qur'an 26:77-80)Note the exemplary manners of Prophet Ibrahim (as) in this ayat. It recognizes Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ as being the cause of everything, Lord of the worlds, the one who creates and gives sustenance. But when it comes to sickness, He refuses to attribute any malice to Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ and instead says, ""when I am ill."" He then continues recognizing Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ as being the healer of the sickness. أَيۡنَمَا تَكُونُواْ يُدۡرِككُّمُ ٱلۡمَوۡتُ وَلَوۡ كُنتُمۡ فِي بُرُوجٖ مُّشَيَّدَةٖۗ وَإِن تُصِبۡهُمۡ حَسَنَةٞ يَقُولُواْ هَٰذِهِۦ مِنۡ عِندِ ٱللَّهِۖ وَإِن تُصِبۡهُمۡ سَيِّئَةٞ يَقُولُواْ هَٰذِهِۦ مِنۡ عِندِكَۚ قُلۡ كُلّٞ مِّنۡ عِندِ ٱللَّهِۖ فَمَالِ هَـٰٓؤُلَآءِ ٱلۡقَوۡمِ لَا يَكَادُونَ يَفۡقَهُونَ حَدِيثٗاAyna maa takoonoo yudrikkumul mawtu wa law kuntum fee buroojim mushai yadah; wa in tusibhum hasanatuny yaqooloo haazihee min indil laahi wa in tusibhum saiyi'atuny yaqooloo haazihee min ‘indik; qul kullum min ‘indillaahi famaa lihaaa ‘ulaaa'il qawmi laa yakaadoona yafqahoona hadeesaaEnglish Translation:""Wherever you may be, death will overtake you, even if you should be within towers of lofty construction. But if good comes to them, they say, “This is from Allah “; and if evil befalls them, they say, “This is from you.” Say, “All [things] are from Allah.” So what is [the matter] with those people that they can hardly understand any statement?"" — (Qur'an 4:78)In another example, when Surah An-Nisa Ayah 123 was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, it worried the sahabah. Abu Bakr asked Prophet Muhammad ﷺ about this verse:  O Messenger of Allah, how could we be in a good state after this verse: ""It will not be in accordance with your desires, nor those of the people of the Scripture, whosoever works evil, will have the recompense thereof (4:123)? Will we be punished for every bad deed we do? There Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: ""May Allah forgive you, O Abu Bakr, do you not fall sick? Do you not get exhausted? Do you not feel sad? Don't calamities befall you?"" He said: Of course. He said: ""That is the recompense you are given."" [1]So what we learn from this is Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Ad-Darr (the one who causes harm), but it is never senseless or without benefit. Remember, Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is also Al-Haleem (Forbearing) and As-Sabur (Patient). So, often what is best for the believer is to ask for forgiveness and to be steadfast and perseverant if faced with difficulties.Ibrahim (as) and the fire:Imam al-Ghazali mentions that anything that happens (good or bad) does not occur without the will of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. The example Imam al-Ghazali gives is not to suppose ""poison kills or harms by itself, or that food satisfies or benefits by itself; or that kings or men or Satan, or any creature - be they heavenly bodies or stars or anything else are capable of good or evil, benefit or harm, by themselves."" All that happens is because of the will of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. He's allowed for the medicine to cure, the poison to harm, and for Iblees and mankind to exist. Another example of this is fire. It is neither good nor bad, but Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ makes it so. When Nimrod threatened to kill Ibrahim (as) he threw him into the fire, ""Allah said, 'O fire, be coolness and safety upon Abraham.' And they intended for him harm, but We made them the greatest losers."" (Qur'an 21:69-70) To a person who has the support of Al-Nafi (The Benefactor), nothing can harm them.Reflection:And so, the believer benefits from knowing these two names of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. We further recognize that it is only Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ who has absolute power to benefit or cause harm. When you're stricken with fear, sickness, or poverty, know that it is from Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ and only He can dispel it. When blessed with happiness, wealth, or good health, it is from Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ, and only He can sustain it.We must further reflect upon our lives and ask ourselves what things are causing us harm mentally, spiritually, and physically. Once identified, seek to limit or eliminate. Alternatively, be conscious and seek things that benefit you. Find ways to incorporate them and make them part of your daily routine. Be grateful and thankful to Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ for allowing these blessings, as we must realize it is all from Him. وَلَا تَدۡعُ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ مَا لَا يَنفَعُكَ وَلَا يَضُرُّكَۖ فَإِن فَعَلۡتَ فَإِنَّكَ إِذٗا مِّنَ ٱلظَّـٰلِمِينَWa laa tad'u min doonil laahi maa laa yanfa'uka wa laa yadurruk; fa in fa'alta fa innaka izam minaz zaalimeenEnglish Translation:""And do not invoke besides Allah that which neither benefits you nor harms you, for if you did, then indeed you would be of the wrongdoers.'"" — (Qur'an 10:106) قُلۡ أَنَدۡعُواْ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ مَا لَا يَنفَعُنَا وَلَا يَضُرُّنَا وَنُرَدُّ عَلَىٰٓ أَعۡقَابِنَا بَعۡدَ إِذۡ هَدَىٰنَا ٱللَّهُ كَٱلَّذِي ٱسۡتَهۡوَتۡهُ ٱلشَّيَٰطِينُ فِي ٱلۡأَرۡضِ حَيۡرَانَ لَهُۥٓ أَصۡحَٰبٞ يَدۡعُونَهُۥٓ إِلَى ٱلۡهُدَى ٱئۡتِنَاۗ قُلۡ إِنَّ هُدَى ٱللَّهِ هُوَ ٱلۡهُدَىٰۖ وَأُمِرۡنَا لِنُسۡلِمَ لِرَبِّ ٱلۡعَٰلَمِينَQul anad'oo min doonil laahi maa laa yanfa'unaa wa laa yadurrunaa wa nuraddu ‘alaaa a'qaabina ba'da iz hadaanal laahu kallazis tahwat hush Shayaateenu fil ardi hairaana lahooo ashaabuny yad'oo nahooo ilal huda' tinaa; qul inna hudal laahi huwal hudaa wa umirnaa linuslima li Rabbil ‘aalameenEnglish Translation:Say, ""Shall we invoke instead of Allah that which neither benefits us nor harms us and be turned back on our heels after Allah has guided us?

النُّورُ,An-Noor/Al-Nur,The Light,"The Illuminator, The One who Reveals, The One Who Guides.","Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ call himself An-Noor (in Arabic: ٱلْنُّورُ), meaning The One who illuminates and reveals the divine light of all the worlds. His light illuminates the heart and provides clarity and guidance. Anyone who turns their back to the true light will be in darkness.","From the root nun-waw-ra (ن و ر), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to give light, to illuminate, to fill with light, to clarify, to reveal, to make visible, to blossom, to be in bloom (revealed), to be flaming, blazing and apparent to the senses, to enlighten, give counsel, and give advice.","Arabic Root:From the root nun-waw-ra (ن و ر), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to give light, to illuminate, to fill with light, to clarify, to reveal, to make visible, to blossom, to be in bloom (revealed), to be flaming, blazing and apparent to the senses, to enlighten, give counsel, and give advice.Allah's Light Described:The light of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ as described in the hadith and Qur'an, Abu Musa reported: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ was standing amongst us and he told us five things. He said: Verily the Exalted and Mighty God does not sleep, and it does not befit Him to sleep. He lowers the scale and lifts it. The deeds in the night are taken up to Him before the deeds of the day, and the deeds of the day before the deeds of the night. His veil is the light. In the hadith narrated by Abu Bakr (instead of the word ""light""), it is fire. If he withdraws it (the veil), the splendor of His countenance would consume His creation so far as His sight reaches. [1]Musa (as) was the only Prophet to have spoken with Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ, and in his conversation, He asked if he could see him, ""And when Moses arrived at Our appointed time and his Lord spoke to him, he said, ""My Lord, show me [Yourself] that I may look at You."" [Allah] said, ""You will not see Me, but look at the mountain; if it should remain in place, then you will see Me."" But when his Lord appeared to the mountain, He rendered it level, and Moses fell unconscious. And when he awoke, he said, 'Exalted are You! I have repented to You, and I am the first of the believers.'"" Qur'an 7:143 So we learn that Allah's light is too powerful to be witnessed, ""Vision perceives Him not, but He perceives [all] vision; and He is the Subtle, the Acquainted."" (Qur'an 6:103)The Various Interpretations:It may be obvious, but worth mentioning. When we say Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Nur (The Light), it is not meant in the literal sense. The light we see is created and is not eternal. It gets emitted, absorbed, reflected, and refracted. Most scholars agree for it to be a name and attribute of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ it must be understood by the consequence and the properties of light. Light illuminates, makes things visible, and shows the way through the darkness. This leads to many interpretations of the name An-Nur which we'll explore in detail.The first understanding is through His ability to manifest creation. Darkness is the absence of light; when we have no light, what remains is darkness. Similarly, it can be said if something did not exist, it was hidden or unknown. Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ has the power to make them visible or known by creating them. It may seem paradoxical, but the natural state of existence is nothingness. We cannot fathom what absolute nothingness is, but that's the state from which all things come - it's the origin. People mistakenly assume that life is just the arrangement of atoms and molecules, but who created the atoms and molecules? Who was responsible for its perfect, orderly arrangement? What keeps everything going and allows them to remain? The only logical conclusion to this question is Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. Without Him saying, kun fa-yakoon, ""Be, and it is!"" Qur'an 36:82, they would not be known.A second interpretation is light manifests; it makes things that are hidden - visible. His light operates at many levels. There is nothing that can be hidden from Him. He is the Al-Baseer (All-Seeing) and As-Sami (All-Hearing). His light reveals, and nothing escapes His view. ""And with Him are the keys of the unseen; none knows them except Him. And He knows what is on the land and in the sea. Not a leaf falls but that He knows it."" (Qur'an 6:59)He also illuminates mankind through His book and His Messengers (may peace be upon them). He's a guide to those lost. So, in this sense, He lights upon light. From the darkness of nonexistence to the light of existence, from unguided to guided. يَـٰٓأَهۡلَ ٱلۡكِتَٰبِ قَدۡ جَآءَكُمۡ رَسُولُنَا يُبَيِّنُ لَكُمۡ كَثِيرٗا مِّمَّا كُنتُمۡ تُخۡفُونَ مِنَ ٱلۡكِتَٰبِ وَيَعۡفُواْ عَن كَثِيرٖۚ قَدۡ جَآءَكُم مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ نُورٞ وَكِتَٰبٞ مُّبِينٞyaaa Ahlal kitaabi qad jaaa'akum Rasoolunaa yubaiyinu lakum kaseeram mimmmaa kuntum tukhfoona minal Kitaabi wa ya'foo ‘an kaseer; qad jaaa'akum minal laahi noorunw wa Kitaabum MubeenEnglish Translation:""O People of the Scripture, there has come to you Our Messenger making clear to you much of what you used to conceal of the Scripture and overlooking much. There has come to you from Allah a light and a clear Book."" — (Qur'an 5:15)The Darkness Within:Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ describes Himself in verse 35 of Surah Nur as the ""light of the heaven and the earth."" Everything that comes from Him comes through His light. To contrast, Shaykh Tosun Bayrak mentions how ""the light of faith eliminates the darknesses of infidelity and sin within and without, bringing us to the light of Truth and salvation and serenity. The devil, and one's own devil, the ego, are those who like to operate in darkness and enter dark houses they will not enter that Divine house, the heart illuminated by the light of Faith.""The darkness in the believer is their ego. It calls us to pursue pleasure and things prohibited to pull us from Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. We can bring light into our life and the world, by and large, through following the commandments of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. By keeping ties of kinship, spreading peace, oppressing evils, gift-giving, feeding friends and neighbors, praying salah, remembering Him in our prayers, giving zakat to the needy, being patient, practicing gratitude, respecting and upholding the rights of parents, children, and women. This is the guidance of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ which illuminates the hearts. ۞ٱللَّهُ نُورُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلۡأَرۡضِۚ مَثَلُ نُورِهِۦ كَمِشۡكَوٰةٖ فِيهَا مِصۡبَاحٌۖ ٱلۡمِصۡبَاحُ فِي زُجَاجَةٍۖ ٱلزُّجَاجَةُ كَأَنَّهَا كَوۡكَبٞ دُرِّيّٞ يُوقَدُ مِن شَجَرَةٖ مُّبَٰرَكَةٖ زَيۡتُونَةٖ لَّا شَرۡقِيَّةٖ وَلَا غَرۡبِيَّةٖ يَكَادُ زَيۡتُهَا يُضِيٓءُ وَلَوۡ لَمۡ تَمۡسَسۡهُ نَارٞۚ نُّورٌ عَلَىٰ نُورٖۚ يَهۡدِي ٱللَّهُ لِنُورِهِۦ مَن يَشَآءُۚ وَيَضۡرِبُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلۡأَمۡثَٰلَ لِلنَّاسِۗ وَٱللَّهُ بِكُلِّ شَيۡءٍ عَلِيمٞAllaahu noorus samaawaati wal ard; masalu noorihee kamishkaatin feehaa misbaah; almisbaahu fee zujaajatin azzujaajatu ka annahaa kawkabun durriyyuny yooqadu min shajaratim mubaarakatin zaitoonatil laa shariqiyyatinw wa laa gharbiyyatiny yakaadu zaituhaa yudeee'u wa law lam tamsashu naar; noorun ‘alaa noor; yahdil laahu linoorihee mai yashaaa'; wa yadribul laahul amsaala linnaas; wallaahu bikulli shai'in AleemEnglish Translation:""Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth.

Light upon light. Allah guides to His light whom He wills. And Allah presents examples for the people, and Allah is Knowing of all things."" — (Qur'an 24:35)Supplication of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ:We can ask Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ to bless us with His light just as Prophet Muhammad ﷺ taught the sahabah.

The intensity at which it shines is determined by their upright character and the righteousness of their deeds. Every good you do illuminates the path toward paradise, and every evil takes from it. The intention of the believer, then, should be to focus on ways in which their being is like a moth to a flame, attracting others because of their light and goodness. يَوۡمَ تَرَى ٱلۡمُؤۡمِنِينَ وَٱلۡمُؤۡمِنَٰتِ يَسۡعَىٰ نُورُهُم بَيۡنَ أَيۡدِيهِمۡ وَبِأَيۡمَٰنِهِمۖ بُشۡرَىٰكُمُ ٱلۡيَوۡمَ جَنَّـٰتٞ تَجۡرِي مِن تَحۡتِهَا ٱلۡأَنۡهَٰرُ خَٰلِدِينَ فِيهَاۚ ذَٰلِكَ هُوَ ٱلۡفَوۡزُ ٱلۡعَظِيمُ يَوۡمَ يَقُولُ ٱلۡمُنَٰفِقُونَ وَٱلۡمُنَٰفِقَٰتُ لِلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ ٱنظُرُونَا نَقۡتَبِسۡ مِن نُّورِكُمۡ قِيلَ ٱرۡجِعُواْ وَرَآءَكُمۡ فَٱلۡتَمِسُواْ نُورٗاۖ فَضُرِبَ بَيۡنَهُم بِسُورٖ لَّهُۥ بَابُۢ بَاطِنُهُۥ فِيهِ ٱلرَّحۡمَةُ وَظَٰهِرُهُۥ مِن قِبَلِهِ ٱلۡعَذَابُ(12) Yawma taral mu'mineena walmu'minaati yas'aa nooruhum baina aydeehim wa bi aymaanihim bushraakumul yawma jannaatun tajree min tahtihal anhaaru khaalideena feeha; zaalika huwal fawzul ‘azeem (13) Yawma yaqoolul munaafiqoona walmunaafiqaatu lil lazeena aamanu unzuroonaa naqtabis min noorikum qeelarji'oo waraaa'akum faltamisoo nooran faduriba bainahum bisooril lahoo baabun, baatinuhoo feehir rahmatu wa zaahiruhoo min qibalihi-‘azaabEnglish Translation:""(12) On the Day you see the believing men and believing women, their light proceeding before them and on their right, [it will be said], “Your good tidings today are [of] gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein you will abide eternally.” That is what is the great attainment.

الْهَادِي,Al-Hadi,The Guide,"The Guide, The Way.","Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al Haadi (in Arabic: ٱلْهَادِي), The One who gives guidance to His believers. His Guidance is beneficial and protects them from whatever may be harmful. He is The One who sent prophets (may peace be upon them) as the deliverers of His message to ensure mankind is guided on the right path.","From the root ha-dal-ya (ه د ي), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to guide rightly, to show with kindness the proper path, to guide on the right path until reaching the goal, to guide aright, to lead the right way.","Arabic Root:From the root ha-dal-ya (ه د ي), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to guide rightly, to show with kindness the proper path, to guide on the right path until reaching the goal, to guide aright, to lead the right way.The Qur'an and The ProphetsThis is similar to the Arabic word, Hidayah meaning ""guidance."" It is also closely related in meaning to the previous name Al-Nur as they both refer to making the path visible, showing the way. Guidance is sent through two means. The primary source for guidance is the literal word of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ, and that is the Qur'an. The second form of guidance was given through His Prophets and the last Messenger, Prophet Muhammad ﷺ. We study and learn from the Prophetic traditions (what he said and consistently did or encouraged). This is captured through his companions and is mentioned in the hadith book collections. Most notably, Sahih Bukhari, Sahih Muslim, Sunan at-Tirmidhi, Sunan-Ibn Majah, Sunan Abu-Dawud, Sunan Nasa'i. More precedence is given to the first two books, denoted by the title Sahih, meaning authentic. There is a sect among Muslims who refute the guidance provided in the hadith even though the hadith shows us the rites or hajj, wudu, and daily prayer. The Qur'an also addresses this exact issue. لَّقَدۡ كَانَ لَكُمۡ فِي رَسُولِ ٱللَّهِ أُسۡوَةٌ حَسَنَةٞ لِّمَن كَانَ يَرۡجُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَٱلۡيَوۡمَ ٱلۡأٓخِرَ وَذَكَرَ ٱللَّهَ كَثِيرٗاLaqad kaana lakum fee Rasoolil laahi uswatun hasanatul liman kaana yarjul laaha wal yawmal Aakhira wa zakaral laaha kaseeraaEnglish Translation:""There has certainly been for you in the Messenger of Allah an excellent pattern for anyone whose hope is in Allah and the Last Day and [who] remembers Allah often."" — (Qur'an 33:21) قُلۡ يَـٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّاسُ إِنِّي رَسُولُ ٱللَّهِ إِلَيۡكُمۡ جَمِيعًا ٱلَّذِي لَهُۥ مُلۡكُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلۡأَرۡضِۖ لَآ إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ يُحۡيِۦ وَيُمِيتُۖ فَـَٔامِنُواْ بِٱللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ ٱلنَّبِيِّ ٱلۡأُمِّيِّ ٱلَّذِي يُؤۡمِنُ بِٱللَّهِ وَكَلِمَٰتِهِۦ وَٱتَّبِعُوهُ لَعَلَّكُمۡ تَهۡتَدُونَQul yaaa aiyuhan naasu innee Rasoolul laahi ilaikum jamee'anil lazee lahoo mulkus samaawaati wal ardi laaa ilaaha illaa Huwa yuhyee wa yumeetu fa aaminoo billaahi wa Rasoolihin Nabiyyil ummiy yil lazee yu'minu billaahi wa Kalimaatihee wattabi'oohu la'allakum tahtadoonEnglish Translation:""Say, [O Muhammad], “O mankind, indeed I am the Messenger of Allah to you all, [from Him] to whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. There is no deity except Him; He gives life and causes death.” So believe in Allah and His Messenger, the unlettered prophet, who believes in Allah and His words, and follow him that you may be guided."" — (Qur'an 7:158)The Guidance of Muhammad (ﷺ) Questioned? إِنَّكَ لَا تَهۡدِي مَنۡ أَحۡبَبۡتَ وَلَٰكِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَهۡدِي مَن يَشَآءُۚ وَهُوَ أَعۡلَمُ بِٱلۡمُهۡتَدِينَInnaka laa tahdee man ahbabta wa laakinn Allaha yahdee mai yashaaa'; wa huwa a'lamu bil muhtadeenEnglish Translation:""Indeed, [O Muhammad], you do not guide whom you like, but Allah guides whom He wills. And He is most knowing of the [rightly] guided."" — (Qur'an 28:56)It is believed, according to Bukhari and Muslim, that this verse was sent to the Prophet ﷺ when his beloved uncle Abu Talib passed away without having converted. From the Tafseer of Abul Ala Maududi, it mentions how the non-believers took this as an opportunity to mock and discredit Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ), saying, ""...you wish that your clansmen and your kinsfolk; and your near and dear ones should benefit from this life-giving nectar.""The response Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ gives to Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) is that he is only but a mere guide. He can show the way to the path, but he can't compel someone to walk it. The only force that has that power is Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ, for He is Al-Hadi. Maududi concludes with the following remark for this ayah, ""He wills not on account of a family or tribal relationship, but on the basis of one's sincerity, capability and inclination of the heart."" This is why when we make du'a, we ask Allah to increase our imaan (faith) and to make us among those who have the courage, intellect, and strength so that we can walk the straight path.Divine Guidance:The second interpretation of what it means for Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ to be referred to as Al-Hadi is expanded with the understanding of this ayah. قَالَ رَبُّنَا ٱلَّذِيٓ أَعۡطَىٰ كُلَّ شَيۡءٍ خَلۡقَهُۥ ثُمَّ هَدَىٰQaala Rabbunal lazeee a'taa kulla shai'in khalqahoo summa hadaaEnglish Translation:""He said, 'Our Lord is He who gave each thing its form and then guided [it].'"" — (Qur'an 20:50)From this ayah, we can infer that Allah's guidance is not just an attribute of showing people the path of faith. It is more encompassing than that. Each creation has been divinely guided to what is required to satisfy its needs. Imam al-Ghazali writes of how an infant knows how to crawl up to the mother's breast and take milk without any intervention (a phenomenon known as ""the breast crawl""). It's also why bees build their hives in a hexagonal pattern. It's the most efficient use of space. This shape is better than all others as it requires the least amount of wax to build, creates a compact structure, and leaves the most space for honey and rearing larvae. Everything has been perfectly guided and accounted for. وَٱلَّذِى قَدَّرَ فَهَدَىٰWallazee qaddara fahadaaEnglish Translation:""And who destined and [then] guided"" — (Qur'an 87:3)Reflection:We ask to become among those rightly guided. We realize in all our actions, there is an underlying motive, and that reason is to serve Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. It is an expression of love and servitude. The reason why we pray five times per day, dietary ""restrictions,"" wearing the hijab, and keeping the beard. All of this is for Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. We should keep this in mind and not forget the purpose of our actions. Don't just fall in love with the routine without thinking of the reason why. Avoid the mindset of doing things just for the sake of doing them. There's a deeper motive to it, and if it's understood, it will make the action sweeter. Remember, in all good that you do, it's to please Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ, to draw closer and strengthen our connection to Him. By realizing this, we may even begin asking upon doing something good if there was a manner in which the act could've been performed that would've been even more pleasing to Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. This spurs curiosity and motivation to study the Prophetic traditions of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ in all matters. In doing so, you become even more guided.To characterize oneself by the name Al-Hadi, we ask whether we are good representatives or guides to encourage people to do what's better. The key is to facilitate, which means to make something easier. It does not mean demanding, scolding, judging, being negative, or making others feel miserable. We can even see how the message of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is explained in the Qur'an: إِنَّ هَٰذَا ٱلۡقُرۡءَانَ يَهۡدِي لِلَّتِي هِيَ أَقۡوَمُ وَيُبَشِّرُ ٱلۡمُؤۡمِنِينَ ٱلَّذِينَ يَعۡمَلُونَ ٱلصَّـٰلِحَٰتِ أَنَّ لَهُمۡ أَجۡرٗا كَبِيرٗاInna haazal Quraana yahdee lillatee hiya aqwamu wa yubashshirul mu'mineenal lazeena ya'maloonas saalihaati anna lahum ajran kabeeraaEnglish Translation:""Indeed, this Qur'an guides to that which is most suitable and gives good tidings to the believers who do righteous deeds that they will have a great reward."" — (Qur'an 17:9)It mentions that the Qur'an has been sent to protect noble/upright character. By following this guidance, by doing what is right, you will have a great reward. Like a doctor who warns a diabetic, you can eat sugary foods but be ready to pay the price for not changing your diet. The role taken is an advisory role, not to be Allah's enforcement officer. Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ reveals to Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, ""Say [Prophet], ‘People, I am sent only to give you clear warning.' And those who have believed and done righteous deeds - for them is forgiveness and noble provision. But the ones who strove against Our verses, [seeking] to cause failure - those are the companions of Hellfire."" (Qur'an 22:49-51) and also in Surah Hud, ""But you are only a warner. And Allah is Disposer of all things."" (Qur'an 11:12) So, we should try our best to raise the standard and uplift each other. To encourage good acts, educate, show, explain, and make something as easy as possible to follow.Narrated Uthman bin Affan: The Prophet ﷺ said, ""The most superior among you (Muslims) are those who learn the Qur'an and teach it."" [1]Narrated Abdullah: Allah's Messenger ﷺ said, ""Do not wish to be like anybody except in two cases: The case of a man whom Allah has given wealth and he spends it in the right way, and that of a man whom Allah has given religious wisdom (i.e., Qur'an and Sunna) and he gives his verdicts according to it and teaches it."" (to others i.e., religious knowledge of Qur'an and Sunna (Prophet's Traditions)."" [2]Prophetic Supplication:We can learn this du'a which the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ made asking Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ to make us noble, beautify us in faith, and be among those who are rightly guided. Ata bn As-Sa'ib narrated that his father said: ""Ammar bin Yasir led us in prayer and he made it brief. Some of the people said to him: 'You made the prayer sort (or brief).' He said: 'Nevertheless I still recited supplications that I heard from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).' When he got up and left, a man -- he was my father but he did not name himself -- followed him and asked him about that supplication, then he came and told the people: [3]اللَّهُمَّ بِعِلْمِكَ الْغَيْبَ وَقُدْرَتِكَ عَلَى الْخَلْقِ أَحْيِنِي مَا عَلِمْتَ الْحَيَاةَ خَيْرًا لِي وَتَوَفَّنِي إِذَا عَلِمْتَ الْوَفَاةَ خَيْرًا لِي اللَّهُمَّ وَأَسْأَلُكَ خَشْيَتَكَ فِي الْغَيْبِ وَالشَّهَادَةِ وَأَسْأَلُكَ كَلِمَةَ الْحَقِّ فِي الرِّضَا وَالْغَضَبِ وَأَسْأَلُكَ الْقَصْدَ فِي الْفَقْرِ وَالْغِنَى وَأَسْأَلُكَ نَعِيمًا لاَ يَنْفَدُ وَأَسْأَلُكَ قُرَّةَ عَيْنٍ لاَ تَنْقَطِعُ وَأَسْأَلُكَ الرِّضَاءَ بَعْدَ الْقَضَاءِ وَأَسْأَلُكَ بَرْدَ الْعَيْشِ بَعْدَ الْمَوْتِ وَأَسْأَلُكَ لَذَّةَ النَّظَرِ إِلَى وَجْهِكَ وَالشَّوْقَ إِلَى لِقَائِكَ فِي غَيْرِ ضَرَّاءَ مُضِرَّةٍ وَلاَ فِتْنَةٍ مُضِلَّةٍ اللَّهُمَّ زَيِّنَّا بِزِينَةِ الإِيمَانِ وَاجْعَلْنَا هُدَاةً مُهْتَدِينَAllahumma bi ilmikal-ghaiba wa qudratika alal-khalqi ahyini ma 'alimtal-hayata khairan li, wa tawaffani idha 'alimtal-wafata khairan li.

O Allah, cause me to fear You in secret and in public. I ask You to make me true in speech in times of pleasure and of anger. I ask You to make me moderate in times of wealth and poverty. And I ask You for everlasting delight and joy that will never cease. I ask You to make me pleased with that which You have decreed and for an easy life after death. I askYou for the sweetness of looking upon Your face and a longing to meet You in a manner that does not entail a calamity that will bring about harm or a trial that will cause deviation.

الْبَدِيعُ,Al-Badi,The Incomparable Originator,"The Unequaled One, The Unique, The Matchless.","Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Badi (in Arabic: ٱلْبَدِيعُ), The One who created and formed the universe without any mold or preceding example. With His will, He invents all that exists without any prior material. His creation is made without any similarity to anything else that has ever existed.","From the root ba-dal-ayn (ب د ع), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to introduce, originate, start, innovate to do for the first time, and not after the similitude of anything pre-existing to cause to exist, to bring into existence to devise, to uniquely contrive to be amazing, outstanding, marvelous, superlative, incomparable.","Arabic Root:From the root ba-dal-ayn (ب د ع), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to introduce, originate, start, innovate to do for the first time, and not after the similitude of anything pre-existing to cause to exist, to bring into existence to devise, to uniquely contrive to be amazing, outstanding, marvelous, superlative, incomparable.One of One:Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is original, one of one. There is no one similar to having attributes as He has. There is no one similar in His actions that can create the Heavens and the Earth from nothingness. Only He possesses the power to do things He's done. This encapsulates the meaning of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ name Al-Badi. He is said to be unique in essence and as the originator. He is incomparable, matchless, and unequaled as the creator of the entire universe.As we've discussed in Al-Awwal (The First), there is nothing that predates Him. He is both the original and the originator. This name extends to the next name in the 99 Names of Allah series to Al-Baqi (The Everlasting). His original disposition never deteriorates or diminishes in any sense. In the Qur'an, there are two places where this name is mentioned. بَدِيعُ  ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ  وَٱلۡأَرۡضِۖ  وَإِذَا  قَضَىٰٓ  أَمۡرٗا  فَإِنَّمَا  يَقُولُ  لَهُۥ  كُن  فَيَكُونُBadeee'us samaawaati wal ardi wa izaa qadaaa amran fa innamaa yaqoolu lahoo kun fayakoonEnglish Translation:""Originator of the heavens and the earth.

How could He have a son when He does not have a companion and He created all things? And He is, of all things, Knowing."" — (Qur'an 6:101)Among the disputed names:Here we see the Arabic word badeeʿu, meaning ""originator."" There is some disagreement as to whether this ayah can be used to classify the word as an official name or title of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. But as an attribute, there is no doubt it is befitting. Among the scholars who dispute this as a name are Ibn Hazm and Ibn Uthaymeen. Those that support the view of it being a name are Imam al-Ghazali and Ibn Arabi, among others.The names of creating:As for discussions regarding Allah's unique inventiveness and creativity we've touched on this topic in the three names, Al-Khaliq (The Creator), Al-Bari (The Maker), and Al-Musawwir (The Fashioner). أَفَلَمۡ يَنظُرُوٓاْ إِلَى ٱلسَّمَآءِ فَوۡقَهُمۡ كَيۡفَ بَنَيۡنَٰهَا وَزَيَّنَّـٰهَا وَمَا لَهَا مِن فُرُوجٖ وَٱلۡأَرۡضَ مَدَدۡنَٰهَا وَأَلۡقَيۡنَا فِيهَا رَوَٰسِيَ وَأَنۢبَتۡنَا فِيهَا مِن كُلِّ زَوۡجِۭ بَهِيجٖ تَبۡصِرَةٗ وَذِكۡرَىٰ لِكُلِّ عَبۡدٖ مُّنِيبٖ وَنَزَّلۡنَا مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مَآءٗ مُّبَٰرَكٗا فَأَنۢبَتۡنَا بِهِۦ جَنَّـٰتٖ وَحَبَّ ٱلۡحَصِيدِ وَٱلنَّخۡلَ بَاسِقَٰتٖ لَّهَا طَلۡعٞ نَّضِيدٞ رِّزۡقٗا لِّلۡعِبَادِۖ وَأَحۡيَيۡنَا بِهِۦ بَلۡدَةٗ مَّيۡتٗاۚ كَذَٰلِكَ ٱلۡخُرُوجُ(6) Afalam yanzurooo ilas samaaa'i fawqahum kaifa banainaahaa wa zaiyannaahaa wa maa lahaa min furooj (7) Wal arda madadnaahaa wa alqainaa feehaa rawaasiya wa ambatnaa feehaa min kulli zawjim baheej (8) Tabsiratanw wa zikraa likulli ‘abdim muneeb (9) Wa nazzalnaa minas samaaa'i maaa'am mubaarakan fa ambatnaa bihee jannaatinw wa habbal haseed (10) Wannakhla baasiqaatil laha tal'un nadeed (11) Rizqal lil'ibaad, wa ahyainaa bihee baldatam maitaa; kazaalikal khuroojEnglish Translation:""(6) Have they not looked at the heaven above them - how We structured it and adorned it and [how] it has no rifts? (7) And the earth - We spread it out and cast therein firmly set mountains and made grow therein [something] of every beautiful kind,(8) Giving insight and a reminder for every servant who turns [to Allah].(9) And We have sent down blessed rain from the sky and made grow thereby gardens and grain from the harvest (10) And lofty palm trees having fruit arranged in layers - (11) As provision for the servants, and We have given life thereby to a dead land. Thus is the resurrection."" — (Qur'an 50:6-11)Reflection:In realizing that Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Badi, absolutely unique, we ask ourselves, who else is more deserving of praise and worship? We recognize it is Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ who has spoiled us with His blessings and all that is in the universe. In His uniqueness and perfection of attributes, everything is in harmonious balance. We may not see it this way if He's withheld something we desire, but we're surrounded by so many other blessings that they don't even register on our radar. We remain oblivious and unaware, which causes us to be unthankful. Whatever we focus on is what we will feel internally. But if we take the time to study and contemplate what it means for Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ to be Al-Badi, we can be increased in our shukr (thankfulness) towards Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ as many of His blessings will come to light.Realizing your uniqueness:You don't have to look further than to analyze the tip of your finger to be amazed. There are 7,753,000,000+ people on earth, and no two people share the same fingerprints. Not even identical twins. How can you not say, Subhanallah? Realize there will never be another you. No person walking this earth (past, present, or future) will look exactly like you and share the same experiences you've had, your personality, individual qualities, thoughts, or feelings. You are incomparable, a one-of-one but in a different sense.It was narrated that Abu Hurairah said: ""The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: 'The strong believer is better and more beloved to Allah than the weak believer, although both are good. Strive for that which will benefit you, seek the help of Allah, and do not feel helpless. If anything befalls you, do not say, ""if only I had done such and such,"" rather say ""Qaddara Allahu wa ma sha'a fa'ala (Allah has decreed and whatever he wills, He does)."" For (saying) 'If' opens (the door) to the deeds of Satan.'"" [1]Ask yourself, how can you further yourself and become a rare distinguished individual in the sight of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ? This can be increased in beneficial knowledge, temperance, in being a better husband or wife. Don't waste your effort on differentiating yourself in vain or superficial ways. This will be an endless chase and will not help to seek Allah's approval. Instead, you could become a unique individual in character. For example, who likes traffic? Only a rare person would find traffic amusing rather than frustrating. A time to sit, reflect and count the many blessings of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. The path many take is to get angry and impatient and feel justified in these emotions. All this is a deliberate decision to savor and enjoy all the experiences and possibilities of life. How many more unique perspectives like this are available to the mind to find and adopt? Each person's circumstance will be different and require deep reflection. But the outcome should bring about love for Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. Try changing the frequency of the radio your mind automatically tunes into. Find the alhamdulillah station.References:[1] Sahih (Darussalam) Sunan Ibn Majah 79"
اَلْبَاقِي,Al-Baqi,The Everlasting,"The Eternal, Ever-Present, The Immutable.","Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Baqi (in Araic: ٱلْبَاقِي), The Everlasting. The one who has always existed and who will never cease to be. He is the one whose existence doesn't have a beginning nor an end. The virtue of this name signifies Allah as being perpetual, endless, and everlasting. He will remain forever and unaffected by time.","From the ba-qaf-ya (ب ق ي), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: To continue, to remain, and to endure. To be permanent, everlasting, and constant. To survive forever, to be eternal. To be incessant, continuous, and endless.","Arabic Root:From the ba-qaf-ya (ب ق ي), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: To continue, to remain, and to endure. To be permanent, everlasting, and constant. To survive forever, to be eternal. To be incessant, continuous, and endless.Among the disputed names:As we've mentioned in the last name, different scholars have different criteria for what qualifies as a name of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. Of the 99 names, 81 are explicitly mentioned in the Qur'an. Therefore, there is not one agreed-upon list for the remaining 18 names. al-Baqi is one of those names which is not included by certain scholars. This list includes Ibn Uthaymeen, Ibn Hazm, and Ibn Hajar, among others. However, others, such as Ibn Arabi, Imam al-Bayhaqi, and al-Ghazali, have included this name in their lists.Forever and Ever:We've briefly described this attribute of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ in Al-Awwal (The First) and Al-Akhir (The Last), but there is a difference in the interpreted meaning each name conveys. Al-Awwal teaches us about Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ as being the beginning of all creation, Al-Akhir describes Him as being the last. However, with Al-Baqi, it describes Allah's nature to be everlasting or eternal. Being called the first and the last can seem bounded or constrained by time. Al-Baqi affirms to us that Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ transcends time. There is no before or after with respect to Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. He just is and always will be.Time as it relates to Allah (سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ):Time is a creation of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ, and His perception of it is unchanging. As Imam Ghazali mentions, ""only changeable things participate in past or future because past or future are temporal expressions."" So Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ can't be understood according to the same laws of physics He has bounded creation by. He transcends the nature of what He created and is not constrained by it. The mind is incapable of understanding what this truly means as itself is created by Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ and is limited by its very nature.The prospect of Allah's non-existence seems completely irrational. Imam Ghazali further explains, ""He is the existent whose existence is necessary in itself."" It is inconceivable to imagine how something could exist in and of itself. But His existence is, and it's everlasting. For this reason, we are all here today. He's allowed for us to be and gives us our continued sustenance and purpose for existing. مَا عِندَكُمۡ يَنفَدُ وَمَا عِندَ ٱللَّهِ بَاقٖۗ وَلَنَجۡزِيَنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ صَبَرُوٓاْ أَجۡرَهُم بِأَحۡسَنِ مَا كَانُواْ يَعۡمَلُونَmaa indakum yanfadu wa maa indal laahi baaq; wa lanajziyannal lazeena sabarooo ajjrahum bi ahsani maa kaanoo ya'maloonEnglish Translation:""Whatever you have will end, but what Allah has is lasting. And We will surely give those who were patient their reward according to the best of what they used to do."" — (Qur'an 16:96) كُلُّ مَنۡ عَلَيۡهَا فَانٖ وَيَبۡقَىٰ وَجۡهُ رَبِّكَ ذُو ٱلۡجَلَٰلِ وَٱلۡإِكۡرَامِ(26) Kullu man ‘alaihaa faan (27) Wa yabqaa wajhu rabbika zul jalaali wal ikraamEnglish Translation:""(26) Everyone upon the earth will perish, (27) And there will remain the Face of your Lord, Owner of Majesty and Honor."" — (Qur'an 55:26-27)From the story of Musa (as):The believer benefits from knowing that Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Baqi. We realize the best thing for us is to worship Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ and seek His approval. All else that is perishable disqualifies itself from being praiseworthy.This is something the sorcerers in the story of Musa (as) realized. Firawn had gathered the best magicians in the city to disprove the magic Musa (as) had presented. They challenged him, ""Some sorcerers stepped forward and challenged Musa (as), ""O Moses, either you throw [your staff], or we will be the ones to throw [first]"" (Qur'an 7:115), and in the following ayah, ""[..] they presented a great [feat of] magic."" Next, Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ inspired Moses, ""'Throw your staff,' and at once it devoured what they were falsifying. So the truth was established, and abolished was what they were doing. And Pharaoh and his people were overcome right there and became debased."" (Qur'an 7:117-119). قَالُواْ لَن نُّؤۡثِرَكَ عَلَىٰ مَا جَآءَنَا مِنَ ٱلۡبَيِّنَٰتِ وَٱلَّذِي فَطَرَنَاۖ فَٱقۡضِ مَآ أَنتَ قَاضٍۖ إِنَّمَا تَقۡضِي هَٰذِهِ ٱلۡحَيَوٰةَ ٱلدُّنۡيَآ إِنَّآ ءَامَنَّا بِرَبِّنَا لِيَغۡفِرَ لَنَا خَطَٰيَٰنَا وَمَآ أَكۡرَهۡتَنَا عَلَيۡهِ مِنَ ٱلسِّحۡرِۗ وَٱللَّهُ خَيۡرٞ وَأَبۡقَىٰٓ(72) Qaaloo lan nu'siraka ‘alaa maa jaaa'anaa minal baiyinaati wallazee fataranaa faqdimaaa anta qaad; innamaa taqdee haazihil hayaatad dunyaa (73) Innaaa aamannaa bi Rabbinaa liyaghfira lanaa khataayaanaa wa maaa akrahtanaa ‘alaihi minas sihr; wallaahu khairunw wa abqaa English Translation:""(72) They said, 'Never will we prefer you over what has come to us of clear proofs and [over] He who created us. So decree whatever you are to decree. You can only decree for this worldly life. (73) Indeed, we have believed in our Lord that He may forgive us our sins and what you compelled us [to do] of magic. And Allah is better and more enduring.'"" — (Qur'an 20:72-73)The sorcerers became confident in Allah's existence and realized that the promises of Firawn were temporary and futile compared to the rewards of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ who is more enduring. Similarly, we recognize the opposite may be true, and the punishment of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ could be more lasting than the punishment of Firawn, ""And whatever thing you [people] have been given - it is [only for] the enjoyment of worldly life and its adornment. And what is with Allah is better and more lasting; so will you not use reason?"" (Qur'an 28:60) This is similar to how Prophet Yusuf (as) made a du'a saying, ""My Lord, prison is more to my liking than that to which they invite me [...]"" (Qur'an 12:33). His faith in Allah's promise was so strong that he would rather go to prison being righteous than committing sin and being free. He recognized the rewards of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ are far better and more everlasting than any temporary pleasure incited by shaitan.On cursing time:Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying: Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, said: The son of Adam displeases Me by abusing Dahr (time), whereas I am Dahr (time)--I alter nate the night and the day. [1]It is said in this hadith that the Prophet ﷺ told us to not curse time. What is meant by time here? Time is reality, the unfolding of current events. Everything that happens is by the divine decree of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. By cursing what has happened you're complaining about what Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ ordained. As the hadith mentions, this is displeasing to Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ, and this reaction should be avoided. If something breaks, there's no point in verbally expressing discontent about what has already happened. The mind should automatically go to saying, alhamdulillah, and figure out the next best step. Don't suffer twice by lamenting what transpired and relieving the pain.Abu Sa'id al-Khudri reported that some people from among the Ansar begged from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and he gave them. They again begged him and he again gave them, till when what was in his possession was exhausted he said: Whatever good (riches, goods) I have, I will not withhold it from you. He who refrains from begging Allah safeguards him against want. and he who seeks sufficiency, Allah would keep him in a state of sufficiency, and he who shows endurance. Allah would grant him power to endure, and none is blessed with an endowment better and greater than endurance. [2]Reflection:With regards to our connection with this name, it's limited as our life is finite. The thing we should exhibit permanence in is our imaan (faith). There is a blessing in meditating upon this further. We shouldn't procrastinate as the concept of forever is only for Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. As Shaykh Tosun Bayrak writes, ""Yet there is a way to gain an eternal life during the short visit here. It is achieved by not tying one's heart to this world. It is by not working only for profit in this world, by not working for one's own immediate benefit. If one works for Allah's sake, for Allah's pleasure, for the benefit of Allah's creation now and in the future, when all is ended, and this body has returned to dust one's work will carry one to Eternity."" As cliche as it sounds — and perhaps with the explanation of the name Al-Baqi it resonates more — we realize there is no better time for change than now. We should work towards bringing an end to destructive or unhealthy habits and promote/nurture the good ones.References:[1] Sahih Muslim 2246b[2] Sahih Muslim 1053a"
الْوَارِثُ,Al-Warith,The Inheritor,"The Heir, The Inheritor of All.","Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Warith (in Arabic: ٱلْوَارِثُ), The One who remains after all has past. He is everlasting, and to whom all possessions will be returned.","From the root waw-ra-tha (و ر ث), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to inherit, to be an heir, survivor, to be the owner or sustainer after someone.","Arabic Root:From the root waw-ra-tha (و ر ث), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to inherit, to be an heir, survivor, to be the owner or sustainer after someone.What does it means for Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ to inherit?We begin by defining what it means to receive an inheritance. It usually refers to the passing down of money, property, or some material thing from one person to another upon their passing. This is typically a transfer from a parent or spouse down the family tree to preserve whatever wealth they had. Now, with respect to Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ what does it mean to say he is Al-Warith, The Inheritor? As we discussed in the previous name Al-Baqi (The Everlasting) and Al-Akhir (The Last), He is the one who will exist after all possessors disappear. He is also the originator (Al-Badi) and the creator (Al-Khaliq), so naturally, all things belong to Him. So when all is said and done, when creation vanishes, all things will return to their rightful owner. وَإِنَّا لَنَحْنُ نُحْىِۦ وَنُمِيتُ وَنَحْنُ ٱلْوَٰرِثُونَWa innnaa la nahnu nuhyee wa numeetu wa nahnul waarisoonEnglish Translation:""And indeed, it is We who give life and cause death, and We are the Inheritor."" — (Qur'an 15:23) وَزَكَرِيَّآ إِذۡ نَادَىٰ رَبَّهُۥ رَبِّ لَا تَذَرۡنِي فَرۡدٗا وَأَنتَ خَيۡرُ ٱلۡوَٰرِثِينَWa Zakariyyaaa iz naadaa Rabbahoo Rabbi laa tazarnee fardanw wa Anta khairul waariseenEnglish Translation:""And [mention] Zechariah, when he called to his Lord, 'My Lord, do not leave me alone [with no heir], while you are the best of inheritors.'"" — (Qur'an 21:89)Understanding that Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Warith is also a testament to the person's belief in tawhid (oneness). We recognize Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ works alone, and so the claim to everything is for Him solely. He has no partners which whom the inheritance must be shared with. يَوْمَ هُم بَـٰرِزُونَ ۖ لَا يَخْفَىٰ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ مِنْهُمْ شَىْءٌۭ ۚ لِّمَنِ ٱلْمُلْكُ ٱلْيَوْمَ ۖ لِلَّهِ ٱلْوَٰحِدِ ٱلْقَهَّارِYawma hum baarizoona laa yakhfaa alal laahi minhum shai; limanil mulkul Yawma lillaahil Waahidil QahaarEnglish Translation:""The Day they come forth nothing concerning them will be concealed from Allah. To whom belongs [all] sovereignty this Day? To Allah, the One, the Prevailing."" — (Qur'an 40:16)The 80-year-old version of you:The believer benefits from knowing that Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Warith in many ways. There is a story of a very wealthy man who died. At his funeral, a colleague asked, ""I wonder how much he left?"" to which someone replied, ""I believe he left it all.""The lesson is that we need to be wiser in our pursuits and how we spend our time. One of the foundational teachings of Islam is that all things return to Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. Nothing was ever ours to begin with. Imagine speaking with your 80-year-old self. What would the older you say to the you of today? Do you think he/she would be happy with how you're spending time? Perhaps you're too hard on yourself or sacrificed too much in the name of worldly pursuits. It's a useful way to think about decision-making; what would your eighty-year-old self think about the thing that's troubling the you of today?As we mentioned previously, wanting financial security for your family's well-being is an honorable mission. When the only pursuit is money, that's a problem. Seeking enjoyment is fine. Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ does not say we are forbidden from seeking pleasure from things which He's allowed. The problems arise when you only live for pleasure and forget your duty towards Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ.Reflection: وَكَمْ أَهْلَكْنَا مِن قَرْيَةٍۭ بَطِرَتْ مَعِيشَتَهَا ۖ فَتِلْكَ مَسَـٰكِنُهُمْ لَمْ تُسْكَن مِّنۢ بَعْدِهِمْ إِلَّا قَلِيلًۭا ۖ وَكُنَّا نَحْنُ ٱلْوَٰرِثِينَWa kam ahlaknaa min qaryatim batirat ma'eeshatahaa fatilka masaakinuhum lam tuskam mim ba'dihim illaa qaleelaa; wa kunnaa Nahnul waariseenEnglish Translation:""And how many a city have We destroyed that was insolent in its [way of] living, and those are their dwellings which have not been inhabited after them except briefly. And it is We who were the inheritors."" — (Qur'an 28:58)This ayah reminds us that all things will inevitably perish, and the cities will be destroyed. It's not hard to imagine the ambition that drove the people who lived in the city while it was thriving. They played the game to hoard, not realizing, in the end, it belongs to Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ.Islam encourages us not to focus on the material we leave behind but on the impact of our legacy. What good will your soul reap even long after you're gone? This is the concept behind Sadaqah jariyah (the continuing/perpetual charity). In this way, we can be the inheritors of whatever/whoever our unique touch reaches. Sahl bin Mu'adh bin Anas narrated from his father that: The Prophet said: ""Whoever teaches some knowledge will have the reward of the one who acts upon it, without that detracting from his reward in the slightest."" [1] Being a teacher or educator allows us to reap the same reward as the person who learns from it. Who can be a teacher? Just about everybody. This does not mean teaching as a profession. You can share your experience and invite others in to learn from your wisdom or mistakes. Sometimes we try to conceal our past from kids to ""protect them,"" not realizing we're just protecting the image of ourselves. They can benefit from the knowledge of the good and the bad we've realized. It's an opportunity for redemption as we also receive the reward if it helps them do good and avoid evil.Other examples of sadaqah jariyah, Narrated Sa'd ibn Ubadah: Sa'd asked: Messenger of Allah, Umm Sa'd has died; what form of sadaqah is best? He replied: Water (is best). He dug a well and said: It is for Umm Sa'd. [2]""It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: 'When a man dies all his good deeds come to an end except three: Ongoing charity (Sadaqah Jariyah), beneficial knowledge and a righteous son who prays for him.'"" [3] Seek ways in which your good deeds will multiply without your involvement. Having kids and raising them to be righteous will be one of the greatest future rewards to benefit you. All the love and energy you spend as a parent is stored inside your child. That kind of effort is not wasted. Like a bank, it's stored and will be inherited by the next generation and then the next. Your soul continues to live through them, and your account will reap whatever good they sow. Consider writing down your own principles on what it means to live a good life and pass it down. You don't need to be a best-selling author to get permission to say a few words on a page.If we reframe our actions by thinking of the future impact we can create, it can inspire us to do great things. It doesn't have to be grandiose. It can be as simple as planting a tree. Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ knows best and loves to multiply the rewards of the doers of good in His cause. مَّثَلُ  ٱلَّذِينَ  يُنفِقُونَ  أَمۡوَٰلَهُمۡ  فِي  سَبِيلِ  ٱللَّهِ  كَمَثَلِ  حَبَّةٍ  أَنۢبَتَتۡ  سَبۡعَ  سَنَابِلَ  فِي  كُلِّ  سُنۢبُلَةٖ  مِّاْئَةُ  حَبَّةٖۗ  وَٱللَّهُ  يُضَٰعِفُ  لِمَن  يَشَآءُۚ  وَٱللَّهُ  وَٰسِعٌ  عَلِيمٌMasalul lazeena yunfiqoona amwaalahum fee sabeelil laahi kamasali habbatin ambatat sab'a sanaabila fee kulli sumbulatim mi'atu habbah; wallaahu yudaa'ifu limai yashaaa; wallaahu Waasi'un ‘AleemEnglish Translation:""The example of those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah is like a seed [of grain] which grows seven spikes; in each spike is a hundred grains.

الرَّشِيدُ,Al-Rasheed/Al-Rashid,The Guide,"The Infallible teacher, The Right in Guidance, The Unerring Director.","Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Ar-Rasheed (in Arabic: ٱلْرَّشِيدُ), the one who guides to rectitude. Allah is the supreme director to the right path and belief. He does not compel people into religion. He has shown the right way through The Qur'an and His messengers.","From the root ra-shin-dal (ر ش د), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be directed aright, to be caused to follow the right course, to be directed to take the right way, to be caused to hold a right belief, to adopt the right path.","Arabic Root:From the root ra-shin-dal (ر ش د), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be directed aright, to be caused to follow the right course, to be directed to take the right way, to be caused to hold a right belief, to adopt the right path.Among the disputed names:As we've mentioned in previous names, different scholars have different criteria for what qualifies as a name of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. Of the 99 names, 81 are explicitly mentioned in the Qur'an. Therefore, there is not one agreed-upon list for the remaining 18 names. Ar-Rasheed is one of those names which is not included by certain scholars. This list includes Ibn al-Wazir, Ibn Hazm, and Ibn al-Uthaymeen. However, others, such as Ibn Arabi, Imam al-Bayhaqi, and Imam al-Ghazali, have included this name in their lists.The one who is guided:The name of Allah Ar-Rasheed, The Rightly Guided, is similar to a name we've already discussed Al-Hadi, meaning The Guide. However, being called rightly guided negates all negative connotations. He is infallible in His direction, and to be misguided is inconceivable. Similar in meaning to the name Al-Hakeem, (The Wise). Imam al-Ghazali writes of Ar-Rasheed as ""acting without any indication of an advisor or the directions of a director or the guidance of a guide."" His very essence is to be rightly guided.The name Rashid is often said to describe an educated person who's been ""rightly guided"" or possesses ""true faith."" A derivative, Murshid, is an Arabic word derived from the same root r-sh-d to describe a teacher. The job of a teacher is to be a guide for a particular subject or topic. In the next ayah, we'll see the use of the word ghayy which is the opposite of rushd meaning guidance to the wrong path. لَآ  إِكۡرَاهَ  فِي  ٱلدِّينِۖ  قَد  تَّبَيَّنَ  ٱلرُّشۡدُ  مِنَ  ٱلۡغَيِّۚ  فَمَن  يَكۡفُرۡ  بِٱلطَّـٰغُوتِ  وَيُؤۡمِنۢ  بِٱللَّهِ  فَقَدِ  ٱسۡتَمۡسَكَ  بِٱلۡعُرۡوَةِ  ٱلۡوُثۡقَىٰ  لَا  ٱنفِصَامَ  لَهَاۗ  وَٱللَّهُ  سَمِيعٌ  عَلِيمٌLaaa ikraaha fid deeni qat tabiyanar rushdu minal ghayy; famai yakfur bit Taaghooti wa yu'mim billaahi faqadis tamsaka bil'urwatil wusqaa lan fisaama lahaa; wallaahu Samee'un 'AleemMUHSIN KHAN TRANSLATION:""There is no compulsion in religion. Verily, the Right Path has become distinct from the wrong path. Whoever disbelieves in Taghut and believes in Allah, then he has grasped the most trustworthy handhold that will never break. And Allah is All-Hearer, All-Knower."" — (Qur'an 2:256)If you're feeling lost, call upon these names Al-Hadi and Ar-Rasheed. Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is the knowledgeable guide who could make the path easy for anybody. He knows our natural inclinations and can reveal certain routes better suited for us. By Him showing us the way to receive His approval, He can make the path to attaining any goal easier. وَأَنَّا مِنَّا ٱلۡمُسۡلِمُونَ وَمِنَّا ٱلۡقَٰسِطُونَۖ فَمَنۡ أَسۡلَمَ فَأُوْلَـٰٓئِكَ تَحَرَّوۡاْ رَشَدٗاWa annaa minnal muslimoona wa minnal qaasitoona faman aslama fa ulaaa'ika taharraw rashadaEnglish Translation:""And among us are Muslims [in submission to Allah], and among us are the unjust. And whoever has become Muslim - those have sought out the right course."" — (Qur'an 72:14)Degrees of guidance:There are different levels of guidance, and it exists on a continuum. It's not as simple as two options, being guided or not guided. Accepting Islam and being conscious of Allah's existence is one form of guidance, but there is more to it. قَالُواْ يَٰقَوۡمَنَآ إِنَّا سَمِعۡنَا كِتَٰبًا أُنزِلَ مِنۢ بَعۡدِ مُوسَىٰ مُصَدِّقٗا لِّمَا بَيۡنَ يَدَيۡهِ يَهۡدِيٓ إِلَى ٱلۡحَقِّ وَإِلَىٰ طَرِيقٖ مُّسۡتَقِيمٖQaaloo yaa qawmanaaa innaa sami'naa Kitaaban unzila mim ba'di Moosa musaddiqal limaa baina yadihi yahdeee ilal haqqi wa ilaa Tareeqim MustaqeemEnglish Translation:""They said, ""O our people, indeed we have heard a [recited] Book revealed after Moses confirming what was before it which guides to the truth and to a straight path."" — ( Qur'an 46:30) وَيَزِيدُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱهۡتَدَوۡاْ هُدٗىۗ وَٱلۡبَٰقِيَٰتُ ٱلصَّـٰلِحَٰتُ خَيۡرٌ عِندَ رَبِّكَ ثَوَابٗا وَخَيۡرٞ مَّرَدًّاWa yazeedul laahul lazeenah tadaw hudaa; wal baaqiyaatus saalihaatu khairun inda Rabbika sawaabanw wa khairum maraddaaEnglish Translation:""And Allah increases those who were guided, in guidance, and the enduring good deeds are better to your Lord for reward and better for recourse."" — (Qur'an 19:76)These two verses make it clear that guidance can come in different forms. The path of truth could refer to guidance in the form of awareness, knowledge, or understanding. Compared to the path of being rightly guided, meaning in our actions, behaviors, and demonstrating complete submission to the will of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. So, we can be increased with these definitions of what it means to be guided—being increased in our good deeds, patience, uprightness, imaan (faith), knowledge, and understanding.Du'a to be rightly guided:We can learn about and recite the same du'a that the youth recited when escaping from the tyrannical king and taking shelter in the cave. They asked Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ for His refuge to handle their affairs. They pleaded for forgiveness, to remain sound in judgment, and to be rightfully guided. It is an all-encompassing du'a for protection from outside harm, patience, provision, and overall guidance. Some commentators have interpreted the cave as their heart, so when the outside world became corrupt, they turned inward to the heart and asked for it to remain pure and guided. إِذۡ أَوَى ٱلۡفِتۡيَةُ إِلَى ٱلۡكَهۡفِ فَقَالُواْ رَبَّنَآ ءَاتِنَا مِن لَّدُنكَ رَحۡمَةٗ وَهَيِّئۡ لَنَا مِنۡ أَمۡرِنَا رَشَدٗاIz awal fityatu ilal Kahfi faqaaloo Rabbanaaa aatinaa mil ladunka rahmatanw wa haiyi' lanaa min amrinaa rashadaaEnglish Translation:""[Mention] when the youths retreated to the cave and said, 'Our Lord, grant us from Yourself mercy and prepare for us from our affair right guidance.'"" — (Qur'an 18:10)Reflection:We can find peace in knowing that Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Rasheed. The guidance that He has provided is divine guidance. He is the unerring director and the infallible teacher. Therefore His direction through the Qur'an and His Messengers (may peace be upon them) is the truth that we seek. We should ask to be rightly guided in all matters. We should approach each problem we face with the looming thought, what response would please Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ? And to be rightly guided to fulfill then whatever Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ seeks. Sometimes it may not be apparent, but in understanding this name, we can trust the guidance that Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ provided for us is what was best for us anyways. We should have no regret knowing the actions taken were for the best.In the personal striving to have the best character, we should seek to be rightly guided in our speech, knowledge, justice, and emotions. There is a balance to emotions that require mastery. When we suffer a loss, we are allowed to grieve, but we shouldn't become so hurt that we are unhappy with Allah's qadr. It's also possible to be rightly guided in anger. For example, anger for the sake of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is justified. It is said the Prophet ﷺ only got angry when the commandments of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ were violated. But this was done eloquently, not to quarrel and publicly humiliate, but to instruct one back to Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. This requires a level of control and balance only the unique possess. We should ask Allah to be increased in guidance and among those rightly guided in all respects. ٱهۡدِنَا ٱلصِّرَٰطَ ٱلۡمُسۡتَقِيمَ صِرَٰطَ ٱلَّذِينَ أَنۡعَمۡتَ عَلَيۡهِمۡ غَيۡرِ ٱلۡمَغۡضُوبِ عَلَيۡهِمۡ وَلَا ٱلضَّآلِّينَIhdinas-Siraatal-Mustaqeem Siraatal-lazeena an'amta 'alaihim ghayril-maghdoobi alaihim wa lad-daaalleenEnglish Translation:""Guide us to the straight path - The path of those upon whom You have bestowed favor, not of those who have evoked [Your] anger or of those who are astray."" — (Qur'an 1:6-7)"
الصَّبُورُ,As-Sabur / As-Saboor,The Patient,"The All-Patient, The Restrained, The Forbearing.","Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is As-Sabur (in Arabic: ٱلْصَّبُورُ), The One who is most patient and enduring. He is not hasty in His actions but waits for the proper time. He has all the power to punish those who do wrong, but instead, He allows time for us to repent and change course to comeback to the right path.","From the root sad-ba-ra (ص ب ر), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be patient, to be enduring, to endure trial or affliction with good manner, to be contented in trial or affliction without show of complaint, to make no distinction between comfort and affliction, to bear calmly, to persevere cheerfully, to be steadfast, constant, to restrain, confine, withhold from something.","Arabic Root:From the root sad-ba-ra (ص ب ر), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be patient, to be enduring, to endure trial or affliction with good manner, to be contented in trial or affliction without show of complaint, to make no distinction between comfort and affliction, to bear calmly, to persevere cheerfully, to be steadfast, constant, to restrain, confine, withhold from something.Among the disputed names:As we've mentioned in previous names, different scholars have different criteria for what qualifies as a name of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ.

As-Sabur is one of those names which is not included by certain scholars. This list includes Ibn al-Wazir, Ibn Hazm, and Ibn al-Uthaymeen. However, others, such as Ibn Arabi, Imam al-Bayhaqi, and Imam al-Ghazali, have included this name in their lists.Does Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ have more than ninety-nine names?Alhamdulillah, we've reached the ""last name"" of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. We put this in quotes because Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ has many, many names, and there is no one definitive list. As we've mentioned about the disputed names, different scholars recognize different attributes of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ which they derive from the Qur'an and Sunnah. For example, Ibn Uthaymeen includes names such as Al-Jameel (The Beautiful One), Al-Jawad (The Munificent/Generous), Ash-Shafee (The One who Cures), At-Tayyib (The Pure One), Ar-Rabb (The Lord), Ar-Rafeeq (The Gentle), Al-Illah (The one who is to be worshipped). These names may already be familiar to you, and as attributes of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ they are completely acceptable.Allah has ninety-nine Names, i.e., one hundred minus one, and whoever believes in their meanings and acts accordingly will enter Paradise.  [1] The analogy which is often quoted to explain this hadith is if you were to say I have ninety-nine dollars, does that mean that's all you have? No, that's all you may have in your wallet, but it's not all you have.Ibn Mas'ud reported: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, ""If any Muslim is afflicted with distress and makes this supplication, then his supplication will be answered: O Allah, I am Your servant, the son of Your servant, the son of Your maidservant. My forelock is in Your hand, Your command concerning me prevails, and Your decision concerning me is fair. I call upon You by every one of the beautiful names with which You have described Yourself, or which You have revealed in Your Book, or You have taught to any of Your creatures, or which You have chosen to keep in the knowledge of the Unseen with You, to make the Quran the delight of my soul, the light of my heart, and to remove my sadness and dispel my anxiety."" The Prophet said, ""If he says this, Allah will remove his affliction and replace it with joy and happiness."" [2]We emphasize one part of the hadith, ""...or which You have chosen to keep in the knowledge of the Unseen with You,"" which implies there are names and qualities of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ which are not known to man. If Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is Al-Kabeer (The Great One), we must realize the extent of His greatness can't be fully understood. So in studying these attributes, we only get a glimpse of His essence.Exploring the name As-Sabur:The name of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ As-Sabur, the patient. As we come to know from these attributes, Allah's blessings are immense. We are forever indebted to Him, and we could never reciprocate or do enough to equalize the blessings He's given us. The gift of life, our health, faith, and its sustenance in every moment is because of His will. In return, Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ commands from us very little, and even in that, we sometimes fall short. For example, even when we offer our Salah, it can be deficient. Our bodies go through the motion, our tongues say the words, but our minds remain preoccupied with worldly distractions. We're thinking of things we can't wait to do after our prayer is over instead of being present in our salah.At other times we transgress the boundaries of acceptable behavior. We defy His command with things He has forbidden. In every situation, He has complete right to exercise His power and give an equal punishment, but He abstains, for He is Al-Haleem (The Forbearing / The Clement One). He withholds His right to convict and keeps the doors of repentance and forgiveness open. That is how merciful Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ is. Even when there is reason to punish, He does not punish.Imam al-Ghazali writes about this very nature of Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ to delay. This restraint is not like a lazy person who procrastinates or a rash person who hastens to retaliate. Rather, As-Sabur is the one who disposes of ""each thing in its proper time, in the way in which it needs to be and according to what it requires."" Everything is perfectly handled by Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ according to His definite plan.Narrated Abu Musa: The Prophet ﷺ said: None is more patient than Allah against the harmful saying. He hears from the people they ascribe children to Him, yet He gives them health and (supplies them with) provision."" [3]Note, however, it does not refer to Him by the title As-Sabur but instead describes His essence or quality as being patient. Similarly, in the Qur'an, we'll see verses describing His nature of showing respite. وَلَوۡ يُؤَاخِذُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلنَّاسَ بِمَا كَسَبُواْ مَا تَرَكَ عَلَىٰ ظَهۡرِهَا مِن دَآبَّةٖ وَلَٰكِن يُؤَخِّرُهُمۡ إِلَىٰٓ أَجَلٖ مُّسَمّٗىۖ فَإِذَا جَآءَ أَجَلُهُمۡ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ بِعِبَادِهِۦ بَصِيرَۢاWa law yu'aakhizul laahun naasa bima kasaboo maa taraka 'alaa zahrihaa min daaabbatinw wa laakiny yu'akhkhiruhum ilaaa ajalim musamman fa izaa jaaa'a ajaluhum fa innal laaha kaana bi'ibaadihee Baseeraa (section 5)English Translation:""And if Allah were to impose blame on the people for what they have earned, He would not leave upon the earth any creature. But He defers them for a specified term. And when their time comes, then indeed Allah has ever been, of His servants, Seeing."" — (Qur'an 35:45)Reflection: The one who sees Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ as As-Sabur can only be increased in their love for Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ. We see Him in the best light as a Lord who shows ultimate grace and patience for all of humanity. We see His treatment and gentleness as being caring, giving us a chance for redemption. A chance to turn back to Him if we've erred in any way. We should rejoice in knowing our creator is forbearing and does not hasten to punish even though it would be most just and deserving if He should.Shaykh Tosun Bayrak writes, ""patience is in Allah's Divine disposition; therefore, patient people reflect this honored disposition."" But the question we ask is patience always a virtue? In a previous reflection, we discuss the character trait of acting fast with a sense of urgency. To understand the finiteness of our lives and to not delay any activity further than it needs to be. How can we reconcile that with the quality of being patient?It requires discernment to know when to apply what. Should you wait to do good deeds? If something can be done now, would it be better to wait until tomorrow? Let's say you set a worthy goal for yourself. Should you stop pursuing it if the deadline you set has passed? Or imagine a scenario of your child learning to walk. Would you ask Allah سُبْحَٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَٰلَىٰ only once to make it easy for them? If they didn't learn right away, would you just quit and say, ""that's it, I guess she's not a walker.""A person should exercise this quality to abstain from things he/she desires but knows it does not serve them. This is obvious for things that are clearly forbidden in Islam but also pose a danger to your well-being (e.g., alcohol). But there exists a category that, on the surface, can seem enticing and offer some initial benefit. These can be very dangerous, it creeps in quietly, corrupting goodness without our knowledge. An example is the use of credit cards. There are real benefits to using cards, cash-back, points, security & safety, and building your credit score. If an unauthorized purchase is made, you can call and get it reversed, whereas, with a debit card, you're responsible.Yet, somehow, all the stats around credit cards are scary. In 2021 55% of Americans had a balance on their cards month-to-month, 15% have been in debt for 15 years, and 6% or 14 million people have over $10,000 worth of credit card debt. This will likely only get worse with time. We live in a society where credit cards are a near necessity for most individuals. It would be best to be patient and restrained from using these ""tools"" when you don't need to. This can be hard because once you start transacting with a credit card, it opens the door for many troubles to walk right in. You can easily overspend what you earn on things you didn't need but want. It's a constant battle. But Anas b. Malik reported: The Paradise is surrounded by hardships, and the Hell-Fire is surrounded by temptations. [4]In the Qur'an and hadith, many passages further encourage us to be patient (i.e., showing sabr). This includes patience in one's faith, patience/restraint in dealing with those who may try to harm you, and abstaining from foul language. It also extends to patience when dealing with some tragedy that has befallen you. The Prophet ﷺ said, ""What wealth I have, I will not hoard from you. Whoever has forbearance, Allah will help him. Whoever tries to be independent, Allah will enrich him. Whoever tries to be patient, Allah will give him patience, and no one is given a better or vaster gift than patience."" [5] وَٱصۡبِرۡ وَمَا صَبۡرُكَ إِلَّا بِٱللَّهِۚ وَلَا تَحۡزَنۡ عَلَيۡهِمۡ وَلَا تَكُ فِي ضَيۡقٖ مِّمَّا يَمۡكُرُونَWasbir wa maa sabruka illaa billaah; wa laa tahzan 'alaihim wa laa taku fee daiqim mimmaa yamkuroonEnglish Translation:""And be patient, [O Muhammad], and your patience is not but through Allah. And do not grieve over them and do not be in distress over what they conspire."" — (Qur'an 16:27) يَـٰٓأَيُّهَا  ٱلَّذِينَ  ءَامَنُواْ  ٱسۡتَعِينُواْ  بِٱلصَّبۡرِ  وَٱلصَّلَوٰةِۚ  إِنَّ  ٱللَّهَ  مَعَ  ٱلصَّـٰبِرِينَYaaa ayyuhal laazeena aamanus ta'eenoo bissabri was Salaah; innal laaha ma'as-saabireenEnglish Translation:""O you who have believed, seek help through patience and prayer. Indeed, Allah is with the patient."" — (Qur'an 2:153) يَـٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ ٱصۡبِرُواْ وَصَابِرُواْ وَرَابِطُواْ وَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ لَعَلَّكُمۡ تُفۡلِحُونَYaaa aiyuhal lazeena aamanus biroo wa saabiroo wa raabitoo wattaqul laaha la'allakum tuflihoon (section 20)English Translation:""O you who have believed, persevere and endure and remain stationed and fear Allah that you may be successful."" — (Qur'an 3:200)Narrated Anas: The Prophet ﷺ said, ""The real patience is at the first stroke of a calamity."" [6] فَٱصۡبِرۡ صَبۡرٗا جَمِيلًاFasbir sabran jameelaaEnglish Translation:""So be patient with gracious patience."" — (Qur'an 70:5)It was narrated from Ibn Umar that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: ""The believer who mixes with people and bears their annoyance with patience will have a greater reward than the believer who does not mix with people and does not put up with their annoyance.""
