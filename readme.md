# QURAN NLP

NLP & ML on the Quran!

## Motivation

I thought about using my knowledge of ML & NLP on the Quran to make something out of it. I have tried to
get summary of the Verses and Tafasir, getting the sentiment analysis, I have made a Search Engine so that 
any query can be searched as easily as a person does on Google

This is a open source project and I am trying to host it somewhere so people can use it and make the most out of it.

Collaborations are HIGHLY welcome! If anyone can help with the code or help fact check the search results or summaries 
that would be a HUGE help!

Looking forward to do something great with Quran & NLP

2. Provided English translation and Tafseer of Quran in easy to use CSV format
3. Used NLP to get top 1000 words used in Quran
4. Used sentiment analysis for Quran each surah

## Future Goals

1. Add more Tafaseer and translation to better train the NLP model for Search Engine & Analysis
2. Make a end-to-end application so that everyone can benefit from the newly trained models
3. Find insightful things from the Quran
4. Make an Arabic NLP model capable of understanding Quran
5. Make a single graph database encompassing Islamic knowledge
6. Making an AI tool to authenticate Hadith


## Important Note

If you find any type of error or mistake in the translation please correct me. If you find the work interesting feel free to build more on it!


## How To Contribute

The csv data at "./data/main_df.csv" is the latest version of the data being used for NLP. I have tried to add as many 
translations and Tafaseer I can, Anyone can add more columns to the Translations or Tafaseer, If anyone wants to use the 
df for their own projects please do

Dataset also available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alizahidraja/quran-nlp 
You can use Kaggle to work on it online too!
